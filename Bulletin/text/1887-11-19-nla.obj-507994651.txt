Australia’s Destiny.
Australia is a land of unlimited poten-
tialities. Not alone in the finite space of
human interest which industry and commerce
can measure, but in the matter also of those
higher and nobler objects in which the abso-
lute happiness and relative freedom of the
human family are comprised. Every news-
paper contains glib forecastings of the com-
mercial greatness soon to distinguish this
continent; every post-prandial chatterer can
say something of the future statistical pro-
gress of these colonies ; such sordid poten-
tialities are acknowledged ad nauseam , but
of our national possibilities in other avenues
of progress nothing is ever published or
spoken. In commerce and money-grubbing
Australia is rightly expected to adopt ways
and means peculiar to herself and suited
her conditions ; but in all matters of politics,
social relationships, and religion it is ap-
parently expected that she should, and be-
lieved that she ought to, follow meekly and
slavishly in the path along which England
has painfully and perilously staggered for
the last eight centuries. Conservatism—the
instinct of dull brains, and the weapon of
social tyrants—however obviously out of
place in a new country, opposes its full
strength in preventing the adoption of any
new systems or new methods although these
may be dictated by reason and supported by
every humane sentiment. To Australia’s
power to work out the social salvation of
mankind in this quarter of the world,
this force of generally corrupt, usually
bigoted, and always stupid, Conservatism
ia ever steadfastly opposed. There is
afforded to our legislators and people
the oppportunity of breaking through
all the class tyrannies and social wrongs
which class-made law has fettered upon the
British people. But far other has been the
aim of those entrusted with the responsibili-
ties of legislation ; their constant effort has
been to reproduce all the repulsive features
as well as the more admirable attributes of
the British system in these antipodean lands.
As they have transported hither British pests
auch as the briar, the thistle, the rabbit, and
the sparrow, to say nothing of the British
bell-topper and the British frock-coat,
so also have they transplanted British
distress for rent laws, the extortions
and abuses of the English legal system, the
Imperial bi-cameral legislative method, and
are daily striving to rivet yet more firmly on
these colonies the class-rule which baa op-
pressed England since the Conquest.
« « *
Sometimes the strong commonsense of the
people has successfully rebelled against the
policy of the dominant class, and has left
noble trophies of revolt upon the Statute-
books of the various colonies. Vote by
ballot was here established decades before it
was made optional in England ; manhood
suffrage is the firmly fixed law in Australia,
while in Britain the oppressed masses are
without that boon ; real property transfer
has been here simplified to an extent un-
known in the United Kingdom ; the religion
of a sect has in no part of Australasia yet
degraded into a State institution ; education
hero occupies a position in national economy
beneath the Southern Cross marvellous to
our Imperial brethren, and so with other
matters of national concern. In the cases
cited, Australia has gone far beyond the
Imperial pattern, and this in spite of the
obstructive power of local Toryism. And
there is not one of such large advances along
new paths, which has not been productive
of unlimited good to the masses of the
people. And yet not one such progressive
measure has been passed without bringing
down upon its authors the maledictions of
those who love English errors, and British
wrongs, more than wisdom and the right.
As Wise fco-day pleads the cause of distraint,
because it has been endured in England for
eight hundred years, so dull Torias were
found to oppose Torrens’ Act, State Educa-
tion, manhood suffrage, and vote by ballot,
and they used the very line of argument
which the Attorney General so readily and
fervently adopts. He is in this matter
merely an imitator of the dullards who op-
posed the patriotic Radicalism of Went-
worth, Robertson, and Pabkes.
* * #
? Strange as the assertion may seem, it is
certainly true that it is in Australia that the
most sweeping and useful measures of re-
form should originate. For here the vested
interests of wealth and caste are less potent
than in any other older and wealthier
countries, There are but few and weak
traditions to fetter the minds of men, and
precedents—such as they are— have not yet
become petrified. The will of the people
can be mure quickly declared in law than
in older countries ; in a month legislative
changes may be wrought for which a year in
England would not suffice. And every
national problem is here presented in a
simple, not in a complex form as in older
States. First principles are not obstructed
by wrongs changed, in common acceptation,
by the tradition of ages into statutory rights.
And, besides all this, it is demonstrable that
the intellect of the people is freer, stronger,
and more original than in the age-old states
of Europe, and even of America. To solve
the problems over which the oppressed
masses of Northern rations are now poring
in vain is the destiny of Australia : a vigor-
ous and thoughtful Radicalism the only in-
telligible creed for her political rulers.
* * *
In fulfilling this destiny, “the common-
sense of most ” can be the electors’ only
guide. The fact that a certain wrong has
prevailed in England for centuries should
have no more weight than the fact that foot-
squashing has been fashionable in China for
three thousand years. The one considera-
tion has just as much to do with any ques-
tion of right or wrong as the other, and
should be just as little regarded. England
has not been, and is not now, so brilliant a
success as a nation, as to endow her system
with any respect. It is to escape from the
oppression and misery which burdens the
huge majority of Britons that most of Aus-
tralia’s immigrants have come hither. Then 1
why, having escaped such misery in the Old
World, should they wish to reproduce in the
New the causes whose effect’s made England
intolerable for them ? Right reason can
give no countenance to such a work. But (
these immigrants, especially those of the B.
R. Wise type, are the slaves of tradition—
merely crossing the seas cannot accustom
their minds to the full measure of freedom
which Australia can afford. As their bodies
writhe beneath the stronger heat of our sun,
so their slavish thought cowers beneath the
shade of trans-oceanic tradition.
* * *
The question as to where Australian re-
forms should begin is easy to supply ; the ’
question where they should end is not now
discernible. First of all, the disastrous clog
of an Upper House of senile nominees of
Wealth must be removed, then the path of
national progress—the progress of the
people—will be comparatively clear. Then
the great work of Land Nationalisation can
be undertaken. While the owners and the
mortgagees of land monopolise the second
Chamber any decided move in the way of
making land pay its rightful toll to the State
is hideously remote. The money-bag House
will sanctify with their wheezy approval
any tax upon food, property, intellect, or
industry, for all such taxes fall upon the
producers of the community, but they will
never approve of any proposal which would
give to the State the unearned increment of
land-values, or of effective Reforms which
would prevent a Q.C. from robbing his
clients by pouching their fees and neglect-
ing their work—reforms which would pre-
vent a junior barrister from robbing the
widow and orphans by playing the empty
farce of moving for previously-granted pro-
bate ; reforms which would serve to pre-
vent money from being omnipotent in every
department of “ justice ” as it is at present.
Every institution and every custom would be
challenged as to its operation under a
vigorous Radical regime, and the paltry ex-
cuse, “ It’s English and eight hundred years
o'd,” would not then be of feather-weight in
the scale of public judgment. If such an
excuse is to prevail the class misery and
class robberies of England must exist in
full force beneath the Southern Cross ; if it
be not allowed to influence legislation and
restrain reform, then Australia may take the
place indicated by every local circumstance
and condition as the political and social
model and teacher of the tradition-bound
nations of every other quarter of the globe.
“Religious Liberalism."
A popularity of the easy and greasy sort is
always to be won by any metropolitan parson
who will enunciate a little religious liberalism.
Three-fourths of the people who go to church go
there because it ia a recognised institution, one
of the several recognised institutions which make
up the present iniquitous organisation of society
into “classes” and “masses.” The Church, in
all ages and all climes, has always been ready to
pander to the sins and vices of the secular power,
it the secular power would only return the
compliment. Every advance in liberality of
thought and conduct since the end of the last
century has been secular. So-called Christianity
has done nothing but tinker up its old kettle
sufficiently to meet the requirements of the rear-
guard of popular intelligence. Well, the parson
who first accepts some fact of science or history
or general knowledge which everyone, except
this rear guard, has accepted in the metem-
psychosis shape of their fathers or grand-
fathers, is likely to become a sort of re-
ligious hero—till the rear-guard gets up to
him again. Ward Beecher suddenly declared
he did not believe in Hell, and all the religious
noodles “ra'sed Cain” about it. As if anyone,
not 50 years behind the time, did believe in Hell,
and as if it mattered a brass farthing what Ward
Beecher and his noodles thought about it, any-
how 1
» * *
Pastor Jefferis is the prime religious tinker of
New South Wales. He has neither high culture
nor high intelligence (except it be in the ranks of
religious tinkers), and, as the Daily Telegraph
people are in a similar intellectual condition,
they shake hands all round on the common
ground of the united efforts of the shoddy
bourgeoisie and the shoddy clericalism to
support things as at present constituted
with a judicious profession of Liberalism. If
Pastor Jkffbris were to die tc-morrow, in four
or five years no one would remember his name,
and if anyone read his sermons and speeches, ai
reported in the D.T., they would wonder why on
earth twaddle like this was reported—twaddle
which, in three or four years (if not sooner) every
parson will have as his regular stock-in-trade.
The amount of nonsense that Psstor Jefebris
gave vent to in his “ great ” speech at the Con-
' gregational Unio”, whenever he left tho beaten
1 track of accepted fact and tried to speak a little
on his own account, was amazing. Nonsense is
usually the result of ignorance, and that seems to
have certainly been the case here. Take the fol-
lowing as a fine sample of the tenth-rate sort of
thing which goes down in a president of an Aus-
tralian Congregational Union as the ‘ philosophy of
history.” Says the Pastor :
“ It were an insult to human nature to say that ia Antioch
i or Corinth or Rome there were none before Christ who
sought to rescue the vicious, who endeavoured to relieve the
poor. But there was no prevailing sentiment as now in
favour of virtue and charity. Neither idolatry cor philoso-
phy inspired men with piety and self-sacrifioe.”
Would any audience of so-called educated men,
except one composed of purblind religionists, re-
ceive such a statement with anything but a burst
of laughter ? Firstly, notice that the poor man
takes “ Antioch or Corinth or Rome ” (it must be
one of them) as the home of “philosophy!’’
Every school-boy knows that neither Socrates
ror Plato nor Aristotle came from any of these
places, and if these men are not “ the fathers of
philosophy,” in heaven’s name, who are ? Pass
that, however ; a parson who only knows his
Bible, does not know that, and so can he forgiven
for not being aware that the Fourth Gospel is as
full of Platonism as an egg is of meat, and Plato
did not come from Antioch, or Corinth, or even
Rome. Let us look to the fact stated. Does not
the poor man pitifully drivel in saying that
“neither idolatry nor philosophy inspired men
with piety and self-sacrifice 2” Nobody but a
silly christo-maniac ever took the worship of
heathen nations, through figures of stone, to be
any more “idolatry” than the reverence of
Catholics for their statues and paintings, or of
Protestants for their perhaps more hideous but
identic mummim and thummim. But if “piety”
is shown in what ia usually called the “monu-
ments” of it, what Christian cathedrals or
churches can be placed beside the colossal ruins of
Assyrian temples—beside Baalbec—beside the
Pyramids—beside the Buddhist temples of Java,
of India, of Japan 2 Or if “ piety ”iato be sought
in the army of saints and martyrs, wherein
does the Mahommedan or Buddhistic calendar
fall short of that of the Christians 2 Were the
Moslem fanatic?, who opposed the Christian
fanatics in the Crusades, less bigoted, reckless,
sure of salvation, through the murdering sword 2
Was not “ self-sacrifice,” by every admission,
carried, both then and now, to as absurd an extent
by them as by the alleged Christians 2
* * *
But turn from the excess of these qualities to
their more moderate and beneficent forms. Was
the self-sacrifice of Jesus, who gave up the hovel
of an obscure ultra-provincial peasant for the
notoriety and fame of a popular preacher, greater
than that of the mighty Gautama, who surren-
dered an empire, a wife and children he adored,
to become an anchorite and then a wandering
preacher, the chief word of whose gospel (which
even Pastor Jefferis may have heard)— nirvana
—means just that “self-sacrifice,” the annihila-
tion of self in the purpose and will of God as a
blown-out candle in the atmosphere 2 Pass then to
Greece. If Socrates’ chief doctrine (and, through
him, Plato’s) was not self-sacrifice, would Pastor
Jefferis first read Jowett’s translation of the
Dialogues, and then tell us what it was ? If the
whole idea of Greek civilisation was not the idea
of self-sacrifice—of the utter subordination of self
to the city, the state, the race—would Pastor
Jefferis first read (say) Grote’s “History of
Greece,” and then tell us what it was 2 There is
one typical instance, however, which even Pastor
Jefferis may have heard of. A Greek poet called
Simonides wrote this inscription over the Spar-
tans who perished at Thermopylae “ O passer-
by, tell to the Lacedemonians that we are lying
here, in obedience to what they told us ! ”
* * *
If the lesson of Leonidas in the pass, of Hora-
ttus Cocles on the bridge, is not that of “ self-
sacrifice,” and, if that lesson was not taught by
Paganism, by what was it taught 2 The Pastor
does well to tell his hearers that
“ It almost provokes a smile to think of challenging the sys
terns which are paraded as the latest offspring of human
wisdom. They may do for platform declamation; they may
win the applause of the theatre; but where are they in the
true work of life 2 Christianity alone can furnish the motive
power to make Australian citizenship what it ought to be
and what it surely will be."
The “idolatry” and “philosophy" of Buddhism
sent out nogreasy ship-loads of christianizing crows
to besot and degrade the lower races. Its missionary
work, spreading from Java to Japan, founded
great civilisations which have left memorials such
as bogus Christian civilisations can never leave
The “ idolatry ” and “ philosophy ” of Greece never
saddled humanity with Inquisitions and Persecu-
tions, with a crew of priest-caste-mongers who
have been the foe of all liberty and light from the
days of Galileo to those of Darwin, and will be,
so long as they have a rotten tooth left in their
jaws to bite with ; but this “ idolatry ” and this
“ philosophy” erected states where all were free,
and the landowner and capitalist were as un-
known as the starving prostitute and the demoniac
convict, and that is surely something. Let Pastor
Jefferis, and those like him, learn to sit at the
feet of such men as Gautama and Socrates, and
purge away some of that ignorance which can be
the only excuse for such God-spat-out nonsense
as prevailed in the “ great” speech of the Presi-
dent of the Australian Congregational Union,
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Europe's Arbiter—A Surgeon!
The armed millions of Europe are awaiting the
issue of a surgical operation. If the doctor’s skill
works a cure, peace may compass the nations for
a few years more; if the operator’s instrument
should fail, all Europe may be at war
within a few weeks of the patient’s death.
Marvellous, that in this age when men deem
themselves civilised, the life or death of one
man should determine the fate of millions who
never saw, and scarcely ever heard of him ! Yet
such is the present situation. If the Crown Prince
of Germany recovers, the ensuing stability of the
German realm and his own strong desire for peace
may defer for some time the disasters of war ; if
he dies, his bloodthirsty son may, and almost cer-
tainly will, drag a teeming continent into fierce
and fearful war. No more repulsive satire on the
monarchical system could possibly be conceived,
It seems incomprehensible that an ordinary surgi-
cal operation should determine whether peasants
in all the country from the Ural to the Atlantic
are to begin the work of wholesale slaughter. Yet
this is not the first time that ihe fortunes and lives
of millions of peace loving men have rested upon
the life of one of whom they have known little and
for whom they have cared nothing at all. Had
that wretched old gibberer, George III., reigned
10 years only instead of 60, the sanguinary
battles of the American War of Independence
need never have been known ; had Napoleon
Bonaparte never emerged from obscurity, bleach-
ing bones would not have whitened Russian plains,
and a great part of the terrible death roll of 1798-
1815 need not have been recorded to thedisgraco and
disaster of humanity. War in defence of a grand
principle—war in defence of the rights of man-
kind, may bo invested with a crown of national
glory ! but wars undertake te soothe the vanity
or assuage the blood-thirst of a man no better and
generally a great deal worse than hundreds of
thousands of those who are slaughtered at his
bidding are a foul blot upon the intelligence of
the age. Under the monarchical or even the
aristocratic system of misrule the latter class of
infamous wars must ever be counted as disas-
trous possibilities. When the will of one man is
the nation’s guide, it is always probable that his
despotic mind may decree a deluge of blood as a
relief to his ennui, a balm for his wounded pride,
or a feast for his sanguinary and brutal appetite
for destruction.

Wanted, a Dynamiter.
The Sydney Improvement Board paraded in state
last week, and solemnly condemned 51 stinking
dens inhabited chiefly by Chinese. Then the
Board vent home proudly complacent with its
work. But do the members of that body believe
that those houses which are tenanted by Chinese
will be pulled down within six months, or even
within six years 2 The Board is an Angora it it
does. We know better. Years ago a George-
street rookery was condemned. The owner or
tenant managed to avert the doom until a new
Mayor assumed office, and then the building was
condemned again. Then the lawyers were set to
work, and they appealed against the deoree, but
in vain. They appealed again on some more
points, but were defeated again, and peremptory
notice to clear was served on the tenant, a Euro
peau tradesman. He left just befora the final day
named, and some Chinese promptly succeeded
him. In complete- defiance of all the statutes
made and provided, the new tenants set about
making alterations in the tenement. They built
wooden walls, put a new front to the shop, and
then calmly started a wholesale fan-tan sheol,
which is still running gaily to good business.
What official was “got at ” remains at present a
mystery, but the proof that corruption prevailed
and still prevails over someone is clear as day-
light, and is manifested by the fact that the
quadruply-condemned hovel stands erect in spite
of the hollow decrees of the City of Sydney Im-
provement Board. When these 51 dwellings,
“inhabited chiefly by Chinese,” were recently
condemned, the Improvement Board rejoiced be-
cause they knew they had done good work ; the,
public rejoiced because they thought the city
would be improved ; but the joy of these was as
nothing compared to the ecstacy of the official
who gleefully counted in advance the huge
revenues he would derive by defeating the inten-
tions of the Board. A new tax has been laid upon
some Chinese, a new outlet has been afforded to
the profitably corrupt energies of an unknown
official, and that is all the good that will ever re-
sult from the condemnation of a majority of these
buildings “ chiefly inhabited by Chinese.” When
the Sydney Improvement Board next travel round
the slums they should take a good and well-
practised dynamitard or incendiary with them to
give immediate effect to their decisions. To go
on in the present style is mere folly.
Land.
Editor Bulletin,— Sir,—The N.8.W. squatters
are up in arms demanding a reduction of rent.
Here in Warialda a squatters’ meeting has been
held to protest against the action of the Minister
for Lands in raising their rents. I am no advo-
cate for exorbitant rents, but viewing the whole
subject, I fail to see any cause of complaint on the
squatters’ part. As a crucial test, let us see how
many will throw up their runs through the action
of the Minister. Here is a class of men who have
paid no increased rent whatever for the last two
years, while the selector had to pay in many instances
double the rate put on the squatter, and that in
advance. The Land Act of 1881 was pre-eminently
a squatters’ act; they were quite jubilant over
this enactment, and well satisfied to pay an en
hanced value in the form of rent, for the security
of tenure which is guaranteed them. Again, the
squatters have crow-picked their runs over
and over, by auction sales, volunteer land-
orders, and wholesale dummying, for the past
20 years. Finally, when the division of runs
took place under the present Act, the squat-
ters divided their runs snake-fashion, taking
in all the good land and leaving out for the public
the sand banks, mountains, and scrub-lands.
Having thus annexed the cream of the country, it
is quite in keeping with squatter policy to com-
plain of the rent fixed by the Government which
has been a too indulgent creditor to them, to the
loss of revenue—making the rest of the community
carry their burden for them. Read this admission
in the manifesto of the Commercial, Pastoral, and
Agricultural Association, page 28 :—
“ Under the old law, the practice of over loading land with
sham and useless constructions made with the object of
resisting selection had been practised to an enormous extent,
with marked connivance and interested aid supplied both by
members of the Assembly and the Lands Department.''
Again, I say, let the squatters surrender their
leaseholds and I’ll warrant there will be teu appli-
cations for each holding from men who will be
only too glad to pay the advanced rental for
them. The squatters now command nine-tenths
of the water of the colony, and nearly all the good


and of the country. They hold Immense tracts
of land, but give little or no employment to labor;
having robbed the poor man of his land they now
refuse to give him employment on it. Their
staple product, wool, possesses immunity from
competition in the colonial market, and is there-
fore virtually protected, but when an M.P. is to be
elected they throw all their influence with the
freetraders so as to save their pockets In statio
supplies, and knowing that freetrade throws t
land into their hands. Landlordism, with i
train of evils, is looming in the distance—it is t
cloud that darkens our social and political horlzo
Our land system, the whole Australian land sy
tern, is fraught with danger and trouble in th
near future. Large holdings seem to be nothin
short of ruinous to the country, and equally
to the holders. In proof—the selectors or sma
holders, paid their rents, &0., punctual
in advance, while a sum of £2,000,000 is still du
from the squatters who complain of not bein
able to pay up. But their alleged inability to pa;
may be traced to their insatiable greed of lane
Involving them in usury, mortgages, ban
interest, &c. Had I any influence with t]
Minister for Lands, I would impress upon him th
necessity of limiting the areas of pastoral leas
holds, and could point out the many advantag
of small or moderate holdings instead. The ne
Land Bill which is now before the country is bu
a poor improvement on its predecessors; the
may be a certain amount of political cunning ant
ingenuity in it, but nothing statesmanlike or com
prehensive—notably there is no provision or elfo
made to settle the poor man on the soil, as th
Government of New Zealand Is doing now.
Yours, Old Subscriber.
Last week a “ married lady,” travelling alone, wa
brutally assaulted in a Parramatta railway carriag
by a male savage who at once evaporated so com
pletely as to utterly upset the old-fashioned theor
about the indestructibility of matter. He steppe
out of the carriage—which, by the way, no on
but the married lady ever saw him enter—anc
with one bound ho was at the uttermost limits
the mysterious Forevermore. A few days ago,
Goulburn (N.S.W.) police court, sweet, innocen
little Gbrty Theobald, aged something under 1
faced the throne of justice and said Edwar
Howell, carpenter, had criminally assaulted her
For a bad quarter of an hour Edward seemed
be on a short read to the gallows. Then on re
examination Gerty wasn’t quite sure; the
she said she wouldn’t swear to him;
minute later she began to wish sh
hadn’t sworn to him at all; presently she
with all the generousness of her artless, untutorec
nature, offered to swear to somebody else instead
next she weakened on the other man, and wan tec
to say no more about it, and, above all things, sh
wanted to get out of there ; and, finally, she ac
knowledged that it was all a lie —boohoo—an
she had never even seen the man she accused o
the night when the assault was said to have bee
committed, and the case was dismissed. Th
police magistrate said that he had never befor
seen such a case of prevarication and immoralit
on the part of any girl, from which we gathe
that his experience must be very short, for girl
have been committing perjury and attempting t
commit murder in this way all over New South
Wales for nine months past, and not one
of them has even been arrested for he
villainy. Too many of the world’s present genera
tion of girls seem to be “romantic” and unre
liable. Even that well-adv *rtised heroine Mis
Cass, the little London dressmaker, who con
vulsed three kingdoms just as the spotless Mis
Bary Jade Hicks convulsed one colony, appear
to small advantage under the microscope. It i
cabled that she admitted in the witness-box at the
trial of Policeman Endacott, arraigned for
wrongfully swearing that she had misconducted
herself in a London street, that she was not alta
together the immaculate little creature she hac
affected to be—in fact, she confessed that she hac
been “ indiscreet.” So ends another romance.
At the inquest on the woman Sanders, who wa
murdered by her husband at Carlton (Vic.)
little while ago, the jury was very reluctant to
bring in a capital verdict against the prisoner
although they had not the slightest doubt that he
had committed the deed, he having confessed his
guilt, and the evidence being too strong agains
him to admit of question. At first the good men
and true returned into Court with a verdict which
practically amounted to a finding of not guilty
but the coroner refusing to accept it, a verdict o
wilful murder was substituted with considerable
reluctance. This is another strong indication of
the irend of public feeling which must eventually
lead to the abolition of the gallows. So long as
juries feel that perhaps the life or death of a pos-
sible lunatic is at stake, so long will they shrink
from returning verdicts compatible with evidence,
and so long will there remain a loophole through
which the murderer may absolutely escape from
justice. The powers that be are lethargic and
obtuse, but after the acquittal of the Richmond
wife-murderer, and in the face of the opinions ol
jurors in more recent cases, the fact that the
gallows defeats Its aims must ere long burst upon
them with the force of a falling steeple.

An obviously inspired paragraph is going the
journalistic wallaby—we have even seen it in the
Argus and S.M.H. — concerning the all too-
ravishing relict of Frank Leslie, the American
newspaper man. We are told that Mrs. Frank
“ still looks quite young, only somewhere about
thirty, and is an extremely elegant and thoroughly
‘ feminine ’ woman. She wears always either
white or black ; does her brown and abundant
hair all at one side of the top of her head, with a
high comb in the other side ; and in evenings has
on a splendid pair of diamond solitaire earrings,
each stone as big as a hazel nut.” In other words,
Mrs. F. L. is a society belle and likes society better
than newspapers. To credit her with wonderful
“ business capacity ”is absurd. Notwithstanding
able hired management, her taste for the glare
and glitter of drawing-rooms is fast lowering the
style and influence of a paper which in poor
Frank Leslie’s days had few peers in the
States. It is the “ extremely elegant ”
woman with the ” brown abundant hair ”
and the diamonds as big as hazel-nuts that
‘fetches” the male journalists who arc still un-
married and who yearn after such a business as
Frank Leslie's Weekly could again be made.
But let them make no mistake about it; all the
above gush is thrown away on the elegant woman
with the “brown abundant hair.” She is looking
round for a wealthy society man sufficiently beau-

There are in Forbes (N.S.W.) a lot of brainy in-
dividuals. if we can judge from the fact that
there has been established a local club pledged to
carry out the land reforms sketched by Henry
George, the St. Paul of Land Nationalisation,
Sydney has no Henry George Club; in fact, in spite
of the material advantages the N.S.W, metropolis
enjoys, the outcome of Freetrade and Centralisa-
tion, it has very little of a progressive character
at all. Perhaps, people cannot think amid the
rattle of 'busses, the roar of trams, and the blatant
twaddle of Freetrade newspapers. A man must
reside in the country if he wishes to form opinions,
away from the madding crowd’s ignoble strife.
Most men who have left a number 19 footmark on
the sands of time have hailed from the wilds.
The patriots of Switzerland and the Tyrol were
herdsmen, and the warrior kings of the East were
shepherds also. In the city men are puny and
small limbed and high-shouldered from want of
fresh air and exercise and frcm bending over dreary
desks. They are pa'e and nervous, and lack iron
in the blood. The robust fellows who come up to
the city, a week’s remove from the plough and
next of kin to the cart-horse, soon brush aside In
the struggle for existence the eager, sallow men
with the feverish haste and the feverish headache,
but no muscle, no frame, no cartilage, no sinew.
In the city men are all the time mentally as well
as physically doctored, They are legislated for
and supervised from the cradle to the grave
Parsons doctor them on Sunday, and newspapers
chop up mental meals of ready-made opinions for
them all the week. They have no time to think,
and very soon have precious little inclination to
do so. They look for their feed of intellectual
pap at the appointed hour, and grumble if they do
not get it boiled soft enough. In the country men
are left very much to themselves, and the solitude
does them no harm. Their legs are strong,
because they never walked with crutches, their
eyes are bright because they never used glasses,
their minds, like their bodies, are sturdy with
exercise and the being compelled to rely upon
themselves instead of relying upon others.
The following palpable lie, which is palmed off by
the Springfield Republican (Murkan print), and
copied with sweet approval by a Sydney daily
paper, is a very good sample of the sort of argu-
ments employed by the opposers of land-nationali-
sation :
“Henry George ‘Stuck.’—Henry George was
asked to enlighten the pupils of Packard Institute in New
York City aa to his doctrines, and got some posers, especially
from the girls. One of them asked : ‘ Did I understand you
to say that all land was God-given for the benefit of all man-
kind ?' ‘ Certainly,’replied Mr. George. ‘Who made he
Netherlands, then?’ pursued his querist ‘ Was not the
land at the bottom of the sea before the Dutch dyked it in
and brought it under cultivation? Were not they, and not the
rest of mankind, entitled to the labo ir of their hands ? Was
this land God-given or man-rescued?’ The new prophet
made only two converts out of 200 students."
This is sheer lunacy. George has never yet
stated as his opinion that man should not receive
the full reward of his labour. But it is a very
different thing to “reclaim” land and to “make”
land. No man can do the latter. Again, sup-
pose that on account of a man reclaiming land he
is allowed the use of it for the term of his natural
life, that does not permit him to leave that land
hampered by conditions to other men who did not
reclaim it. Even the reclaimer’s own son would
have no “pre-emptive” right to the land re
claimed, entitling him to exclusive possession of it
to the disadvantage of his fellow-man. Man can-
not make anything the constituents of which do
not exist already in nature : hence the word
“ land ” must be taken to mean in its broad sense
the earth. George challenges monopoly of all
kinds, not alone monopoly of a single element.
When a man can add a piece to the earth, then
his claim to fee-simple may be acknowledged, but
not before.

Some time ago, at Redfem, Sydney, a labourer
beat his wife and was prosecuted. When the
case came to Court the wife wished to withdraw
the charge, but was not allowed to do so, and her
husband was sent to gaol for six months. The
very same week a nephew of a Supreme Court
judge was arrested on a charge of having forcibly
violated a girl whom he was stated to have taken
out in a boat on Sydney harbour. The girl’s evi-
dence and the medical evidence made it clear that
the case was one of savage rape. The case was
remanded, and when next the girl appeared in
Court she said that in consequence of a conversa-
tion she had had with someone she had decided to
proceed no further with the charge. Whereupon
the accused was set free, though it was open to
the prosecution to have her bound over to
appear and give evidence at the Criminal
Court! Another judge’s relative was being
brought down by a mountain train ia the
custody of a policeman whose revolver he
snatched; then he wounded the officer—a capital
offence—but in the nick of time it was providen-
teally discovered that he was insane. He was
committed to an asylum, from which he promptly
escaped; now he is living happily and sanely in
Queensland, and no effort is made to recapture
him. The change of climate has worked wonders
in his mental condition. Still another judge’s
relative was short in his trust funds to the extent
of a few scores of thousands; now he is in an
asylum, but it is very doubtful indeed whether
the peculiar and systematic form of aberration
with which he is afflicted would have been suffi-
cient if exhibited by a poor wretch in moleskins
to have saved its subject from alleged justice.
We have known a good many madmen to be
hanged in N.S.W,, and we have seen more than
one cold-blooded swindler profit by the provisions
of the Lunacy Act.

A wild and frantic discussion has been making
the hair of Victorian professors stand on end.
They have been inventing a lot of complicated
ways to vote, because at present if A., B. and C.,
stand for a place with only one seat, two of the
candidates may divide between them a greater
number of votes than the third, and yet the third
have a majority over each of them, whilst he may
really be the most unpopular of all, and would, if
one or other of them had not stood, have been re-
jected. So the professors propose to have each
voter describe his order of preference for A . B.
and C. But how is this to be done in the crush
and hurry of an election ? Why, even on what
looks the only plan of getting at the measure of
preference, allotting each elector as many votes
as there are candidates, so that he can give them
one each, or two to A. and one to 8., or all three
to A., unless he had opposition votes as well to
denote his measure of objection, the same thing
would come to pass, and the latter plan would be
too lengthy and elaborate to prove correct in
such a distracting time. Therefore we suggest
that every man should be at liberty to strike out
or to leave whomsoever he pleases, irrespective of
the number of seats, so that no voter should en-
danger his side by striking out one of its represen-
tativea in favour of the other, unless he had solid
grounds for the rejection. By this means the
party majority would prevail, and the most popu-
lar man of that party he returned. Still there
might be a limited temptation to strike out a
favoured candidate on behalf of one personally
more favoured, but it would not influence a large
number of voters who are now compelled to risk
such a selection, and it could be met (if necessary)
by a supplementary statement to be filled up on
the coupon : “In the event only of one of
the above preferred candidates having a majority
over those rejected by me, I select him absolutely
over any other preferred candidate.” This in-
deed would cover the whole ground, and secure
ali the benefits aimed at by the most complicated
system, with far greater accuracy on account of
its ease and extreme simplicity.

It will be as well to say a few words here upon
the vexed question of France and the New
Hebrides. If the French diplomatists regard, as
they seem to regard, every means, fair or unfair,
as admissible for the purpose of annoying and
hampering England, it must also be borne in
mind that the English Royal Court has through-
out hern guilty of repeated insults to the French
Republic as a Republic, and that official recogni-
tion of the French commemorative exhibition
was refused, on the ground that it was contrary
to the dignity of a sovereignty to take part in re-
joicings which went to memorialize the overthrow
of a dynasty and the institution of a democracy.
With the French experiences of monarchy, it can
hardly be wondered at if this should cause
jealousy and mistrust, and a desire to restrict
and belittle the great “kingdom” in every
possible way. And as the French idea of these
Australian countries can scarcely be more ex
tended than that which prevails in England, the
epithet of “yelpings,” applied by some of the
French papers to the Australian remonstrances,
may well proceed from the idea that the voice is
that of a few ruling scions of the alleged upper
classes of England, without any conception of its
real nature as the outcry of a comparatively free
nation. A truer knowledge of what Australia
really is would probably lead to a more friendly
feeling on the part of France, irrespective of her
attitude towards the sovereign country ; but on
the other hand so long as the connection exists the
relations towards England on the one hand and
Australia on the other cannot well be differen-
tiated. One thing is clear, that if we are free of
the taint of the English aristocratic system in our
own home?, it is capable of doing us plenty if
harm abroad in our position as regards the various
nations with whom the prejudices of a few unre-
presentative demag' goes can reverse our natural
relations, either of friendship—as would assuredly
otherwise soon be the case with France, many of
whose Interests are identical with our own—or of
antagonism, as with China, which threatens to
appeal to English authority to compel us to cease
our measures of self-protection against its herds
of opium sodden paupers. What we require is to
be more independent of a country that is already
in many respects a century or two behind us in
the march of enlightenment and progress.
On the morning of 28 th October, when Bonrke
and Collins streets were alive with holiday-
makers, a gruesome drama was being enacted
within the central quadrangle of Melbourne Gaol.
A hideous-looking masked figure stood by a
newly-erected triangle lovingly combing the
thongs of a heavy whip through its knuckly
fingers. This was Jones, the public executioner
and flagellator, waiting for his victim, who was
presently dragged in by two stalwart warders.
Grouped in a corner was a small knot of officials
—the governor, surgeon, chief warder, and hos-
pital dispenser. No. 4909 (known in the world as
Duncan M’Donald) was a crooked minded old
wretch whose 60 odd years’ experience of Chris-
tian precept and example had failed to curb the
oblique sensualism of his nature, and he had been
convicted of an abominable offence. For this he
had been sentenced by a wise and merciful
judge to a lengthened term of imprisonment
and two floggings of 12 lashes each. He
had taken his first punishment pluokily, not
to say defiantly, but he was cowed enough'
now. “It we cannot reform these fel-
lows,” says the humane Anglo Saxon prison
authority, “we will break their spirit.” No.
4904 was a living example of the triumph of this
system. Breaking away from the warders, the
wretched creature threw himself at the flagella-
tor’s feet and begged for mercy. Mercy from
him ! Mercy from the administrator of heaven-
born justice! Of course the bare idea of the
thing was absurd, but you will please to remem-
ber that No. 4904 knew no better. “ Strap him
up ! ” said the Governor, and in a trice he was
bound to the triangle a writhing, shrieking,
blaspheming, shattered wreck of humanity. “At
the eleventh stroke prisoner fainted, but was
brought round with string ammonia, and,” says
a local paper, ‘ ‘ warned that it was no good hav-
ing any nonsense.” And this is the country which
is about to celebrate its centenary !

Judge Faugett, of Sydney, had a very level-
headedjury to deal with last week. After having
retired they returned to enquire what the costs in
the action would amount to: they wanted to
know that before they gave their verdict. Natur-
ally the judge couldn’t find the answer to this
conundrum. Then they considered once more
and assessed the plaintiff's anguished mind at £5,
but as the judge sternly refused to certify for
costs, the plaintiff will be about £2OO poorer than
the compassionate jurors intended. They evi-
dently thought that costs followed the verdict,
But they were singularly wise in considering the
question of legal “ exes.” in connection with their
vqrdtct. They grasped the big butt-end of the
everlasting truth that litigants only consider the
question of damages in the first stages of a suit;
afterwards the only thought of the patties is as to
payment of the costs.
“It Is understood that the Chinese residents of
N.S.W. are taking active steps in connection with
contributing towards the Sir Henry Pakkbs’
Fund.” We shouldn’t wonder. Parkbs has
been a good friend to everything yellow, and a
deucedly bad creditor to every one who had
green in the white of his eye. Anyhow, the
Chinese ought to be a little grateful to him.
Judging from his latest schedule of liabilities,
Ah Parkes owes no money either to Bung Hi or
Chew Yah.
“In regard to the school children, I believe my
hon. colleague refused that anything should be
done in regard to the matter ” (of the Parkes’
testimonial fund).- So said Parkes in the New
South Wales Assembly, yet we have a not very-
dim recollection of a lady—the wife of a Parkesian
M.L, A.—having been publicly thanked for having
distributed the subscription lists (printed at her
own cost) amongst the State schools. Was that
done in defiance of the New South Wales M inister
for Public Instruction, or were the papers surrep-
titiously introduced to the scholars IWe don’t
expect a reply. The solemn fact, of course, is
that recent revelations have absolutely disgusted
New South Wales with Parkes, whose few re-
maining admirers have been milked dry. Last
week only about £l3O was paid or promised to the
testimonial fund, and several localities appealed
to have flatly negatived resolutions submitted in
favour of helping the movement, which is now
entirely being carried on among the coercible and
more unsuspecting portions of the community
the Civil Servants, the women, the children, and
the Chinamen. We shan’t be astonished to hear
shortly that subscription-lists have been sent to the
aboriginal settlements and to Darlinghurst Gaol.

Again we must sorrowfully protest against the
manner in which Australian Banking Company
advertisements are placed before a trustful public.
For instance, in the daily papers we see that the
company claims to have a “ Reserve” of £36,718.
Asa matter of fact, it has no such reserve. The
figures may represent the uncalled capital
on allotted shares, but it is not a “reserve” in any
ordinary sense of the term. And it is remarkable
that th's same amount was advertised months ago
as being so much “ Reserve Capital.” Assuming
that the amounts are identical, we are grieved to
notice thit they cannot in both instances be ma-
thematically accurate. For if this is really the
balance of uncalled but allotted shares, it is clear—
unless there is here the most marvellous coinci-
dence on record —that no shares have been taken
up since, say, September, and such we are in-
formed on sufficient authority is not the case.
This may seem a small matter, but it is not so in
reality, for there arc lots of “ gullible dolts” who
would regard this “ Reserve” with an amount of
confidence equalled only by the trustful anticipa-
tion with which Young Australia waits to behold
William Beach, Esquire, showing the gifted
Canadian the road down the pure and pearly
waters of the Nepean.

It is not nics to say rough things about so highly
efficient an officer as the New South Wales Crown
Solicitor, but being the slaves of public duty we
are impelled to point out that guinea foes charged
by his Department for certifying to the legality of
selection transfers—when the transfer is the result
of testacy, intestacy, insolvency, or is made under
power of attorney—are extortions of Shylockian
although, perhaps, strictly legal nature. Say a
widow is entitled to her husband’s selection at hia
death. If ho left a will she has to employ a
lawyer and a member of the junior bar to unite
their energies in obtaining probate; if there Is no
will the lawyer and barrister must be subsidised
to obtain letters of administration. This Supreme
Court authority having been secured the Crown
Solicitor or his subordinate must certify to the
transfer at a cost of one guinea, before
it can bo made effective. Over freehold
estates the C.S. has no claim, but for every trum-
pery selection he is paid that guinea in tne cases
we have mentioned for declaring that the Supreme
Court has done the square thing in the matter.
While amendment of the Land Act of 85 is oc-
cupying the time of the legislature it would be as
well if the widow and the orphan, the purchaser
from an insolvent, and the transferee under power
of attorney, were relieved from the necessity of
testifying their admiration of the Crown Solici-
tor's Department at the rate of one guinea per
transfer. Why need the fat kine continue to
devour the lean kine thus ?

Editor Bulletin,— Sir—Re your article, “ The
Abolition of Juries,” I have something to propose.
Judge Hayne states that a “judge who passes
opinion on the law is competent to pass opinion
on the facts.” Now I have assisted at many a
tribunal in which I believe justice and law were
exhibited, and where there was the minimum of
prejudice. I refer to Courts-martial. Again, I
have assisted (passively) in New South Wales at
Courts where the incompetency, and, perhaps, the
“religious convictions” mentioned by Judge
Seephen and Q.C. Salomons, respectively, were
painfully evident. In a Court-martial the presi-
dent and members are judge and jury combined,
and are guided by the law (military) and by
honour. Allowing our judges to be honourable
men, my proposal would be to reverse their posi-
tion with the jury. Let the judge find the ver-
dict and instruct the jury in the law of sentence,
pointing out the maximum, minimum, and cusj
tomary punishments. Sentences would not then
be influenced by the acuteness of an attack of
gout in one limb, and it Is Improbable that even a
majority of twelve should be gouty, dyspeptic, or
“coppery” atone and the same time.—Yours,
6cc., Hiram Abiff.
In an affiliation case at Newcastle (N.S. W,),
last week, Mr. J. A. Qorrick, the defendant’s
attorney, spoke of “ embraces ’neath the clematis
and honeysuckle in the golden moonlight of our
summer evenings."
Tin has run up from £70 per ton three
years ago to £130 now. And that is why there
are more public-houses to the square mile at
Cairns and Herberton (N.Q.) than there are in any
other part of Australia.
The following items may not have any
apparent connection, but it is worth noticing that
they appear in this order in a London society
paper:—

worn matter of Mrs. Jefferies and her disorderly house cropped

“ Last week the King of the Belgians paid a hurried visit

Dear Bulletin, —If the sapient N.S.W.
Attorney-General saw, as I saw, what happened
to the late Justice Fellows one day whilst sitting
in Banco with Sir W. F. Stawell and the
late Judge Stephen in Melbourne, I think
he might alter his views about forcing
newly-appointed Judges to hear appeals in cases
whore they had recently been retained as counsel.
The appellant was the inevitable litigant, Slack,
who was conducting his own case, which, strange
to say, he eventually won. However, he was in-
terrupted in one of his arguments by Judge Fel-
lows, who said : ‘ ‘ Really, Mr. Slack, I can’t sea
it in that light.” “ Can’t you ? ” asked Slack, add-
ing : “You saw it clearly enough when you were
thrusting my guineas down your breeches pocket
before they madeajudsreofyou.” Notasyllablewaa
said about contempt of Court—though Slack was
on a subsequent occasion committed by Sir Red-
mond Barry but Judge Fellows rose with a face
as red as a brick and apologised to Slack for not
having remembered that he had been retained by
him. Had he done so, he said, he would not have
occupied the Bench, and he was leaving it when
he was actually pulled back into his seat by the
Chief Justice and Justice Stephen, but he seemed
to take no further part in the matter. Mr. Wise is
very fond of telling us what they do “ in England,
you know,” but Fellows, who was a long time
Chitty’s right-hand man, knew a trifle about the
old country, too.
DEMOS.


HISTORY OF BOTANY BAY.
When Henry Kingsley wrote his book
about Australia for British readers, he told them
of a great, lone, melancholy island in the pleasant
Southern seas—the largest and possibly the
grandest island in the world. The land of lorely
rivers and level gray plains, he called it; the land
of wool and corn, incalculable to the human mind ;
the land of gold and jewels. “ Who were to have
this wondrous land?” he asks, “which lay fer
thousands of years asleep in a summer sea, war-
ing for its owners.”- With all the purblind
saponaceoueness that even good men exhibit
when writing about Australia, he gives the
answer : “ Providence designed that country
for us !"
An early English discoverer.
If the Australian people of the near future
know anything about that matter, Providence de-
signed nothing of the kind. It is only the smug
Englishman of the type that sung “Britons never
shall be slaves,” while not one man in one
thousand had a vote or a voice in public affairs —
who fought the battles of England abroad to take
his attention off his own domestic miseries at
home, that could answer for the designs of Provi-
dence in this flippant and familiar manner. The
John Bull of the past, who looked on the great
world-system of waters as a British lake, and on
Divine Providence itself as a vulgar British Insti-
tution, alone could fall into such an egregious
error as that. If Providence had any design in
the matter at all, it was that the great Australian
continent should belong to a great Australian
people, ruling itself under its own laws, and free
as Providence possibly intended every man
and every nation to be. We can imagine
Providence designing that a great people
Should grow up here, with all the mistakes of old-
world legislation and class-traditions for its warn-
ing, and with all the preventible old-world
miseries, poverty, and ignorance that those tradi-
tions and that legislation have developed into
rank growth, for its beacons of quicksands to be
avoided. So much for Mr. Henry Kingsley and
his rapidly-expiring class.
* * *
Away back at the beginning of the ter-
tiary period, Australia was joined to China
by a broad land-belt. Presently a convulsion
of nature occurred. The land-belt disap-
peared and water flowed in its place. Aus-
tralia “ cut the painter” and floated away, as it
were, on its own career of independence. Wal-
lace’s Line on the map marks where the rupture
took place. Had it not occurred, we might have
been all Chinese to-day, with Australia twirling
its pig-tail for the Brother of the Sun Instead of
throwing up its hat for the lady who is pre-
eminent in grief and in wealth ; and sitting at the
feet of the wise Confucius instead of burning in-
cense to our Old Man of the Sea.
* * *
But our Chinese cousins had another
chance, and missed it. Long after paleolithic
man had passed away, a Chinese junk burst into
these silent seas, with youth at the prow and plea-
sure at the helm, to the sound of the inspiring
tom-tom. Old legends tell how the grisly appari-
tion of these adventurous children of the Sun
affrighted our “ peaceful southern ocean ” like a
nightmare, as it passed on its mysterious way.
We said just now that the Chinese had their
chance, and missed it. That was a rash assertion.
The enterprising navigator of that pre-historic
junk, scanning the future with dim prophetic eye,
saw that Australia had better be left for some
other active persons to do the rough work of
Later Chinese discoveries.
colonisation, and after that his bland and patient
celestial descendants might come along without
ruffling an eye-lash, and scoop the whole institu-

Providence designed the “ pot” for.
* * *
The Chinese sharp-shooter sailed away.
He was our pre-historic ancestor, and doubtless
his statue will occupy a vacantpedesfalby and bye,
when those of Victoria Wettin and Albert the Good
are melted down into copper coin, to compensate
the holders of great freehold estates which will
have been confiscated for the benefit of the Aus-
tralian people. When our ancestor faded away
over the horzou. the “great, lone, melancholy
island ’ had a rest for a time ; and. by the way,
- w h*n the reader digests this history he won’t
wonder any more why it was “melancholy ” Two
hundred and eighty two years ago a picturesque
Spanish freebooter named De Quires paid it a
visit. He also went awav. The Dutch looked in
about the same time. They also left—but in a
hurry this time. The unanimity our early visi-
tors showed in going away is striking. But to do
these Dutchmen bare justice, they got good rea-
son for their action. Their reception, it appears,
was not altogether hospitable. The aboriginal in-
habitants began to hatch a quaint suspicion that
Providence designed the great lone, melancholy
island for them. So they fell upon the crew of the

Dutch yacht Duyfhen, kifled a few of the number,
and picnicked airily on the remains. The unpro-
nounceable name of the vessel is their best
apology. It muft be confessed that their no
tion about the designs of Providence was a crudely
practical one,
* * »
But if the pure Chinese strain wasn’t
crossed with Dutch blood—if we don’t all wear
wide knickerbockers and pig-tails to-day and
smoke big pipes and play the tom-tom—it is
largely owing to the patriotic action of these im-
pulsive aboriginals, and the hazy nature of their
theological views. For the Dutch certainly left
Australian soil in some precipitation before De
Quires’ lieutenant struck Cape York and named
Torres Straits. In all probability both expedi-
tions imagined that Providence designed this
country for them. Dirk Hartog, another Dutch-
man, touched at Endraght’s Land ten years later.
Quite a locust-flight of flying Dutchmen found
Australia in the next decade, from Zeachen down
to Pieter Nayts. Tasman’s visit was in 1642.
He wrote his sweetheart’s name all over the
Australian map, and made it historical. This
was the only touch of tender human senti-
ment the Island now called after him was destined
to see for many a long day. In later times, after
the horror of our history had held its saiurnalian
orgie—when each blade of grass had its horrible
story and every woodland nook reeked with the
strong flavour of bloody reminiscences—it was
found advisable to destroy a good deal of poor
Tasman’s lover’s romance, and change the name
of Maria Van Diemen’s father for one with some-
what less pungent associations. So we called the
island Tasmania —at d complacently allowed the
rank growth of old institutions to flourish, while
the name of Yandemonia that recalled them too
keenly became a thing of the past. But though
Tasman made several voyages there, Providence
does not appear to have designed any part of the
country for him.
A Dutch discoverer.
The buccaneer Dampier, of Virginia, was
engaged in a piratical expedition against some
Spanish traders when he struck the North-West
coast of Australia. Eleven years after, the Eng-
lish Admiralty authorities sent him out on a
voyage of discovery. He held several theological
controversies with the aboriginal inhabitants
about the designs of Providence, and after his
expedition nothing more is recordei on that sub-
ject until 1770. In the meantime the Spanish De
Quires had called the continent “Australia,”
while the Dutch named it “ New Holland.” For-
tunately the Spanish name was the one eventually
retained. Dampier came in 1688. Io is well
to remark that persons engaged in piratical expe-
ditions have neon striking the Australian coast
very violently ever since.
* * *
It is a distressing but characteristic fact
that the discovery of the eastern coast of Aus-
tralia was reserved for a person with the unro-
mantic name of Cook. We have always been un-
happy in our nomenclature. No one with an
inspiriting name of his own wou!d have thoufeht
of calling his discovery by such an uncouth
designation as “ New South Wales.” And no
people that did not glory in its disgrace would
have retained the name and its dismal associa-
tions so long. But the trail of the serpent, as it
were, is over all we do. Do we soar into senti-
ment ? Our airy flight is impeded by the dead-
weight of the Past that hangs like plummets on
our nobler parts - s »that we have to t aorifloe the
delicate flower of romance in the story of Maria
Van Diemen to the necessity of getting rid of the
associate n the name calls up. Do we, like Mr.
Silas Wevg, drop into poetry ? Every bushman
in this afflicted land scou ges our ears with damn-
able iteration of platitudinous phrases about the
balmy fragrance of the yellow wattle-blooms,
until that Australian vegetable has come to have
no more romantic sentiment in association with
its name than the fatuous cabbage or the hypo-
critical onion.
* # *
Cook decided the question that had per-
plexed so many explorers without a moment’s
hesitation, and handed the country over to “my
Sovereign, George the Third,” whose royal pro-
geny—the Prince of Wales and the Duke of York,
uncles of Her Gracious —used to tie their royal
parent to the post of the royal bedstead and play
“ bait the bear ” with him in his dotage, and then
go down to their club and tell what fun
they had with the old man. Greville tells the
story in his Memoirs; and also how the Commons
voted the Dake of York a pension for his fl.ial
piaty in visiting his demented progenitor on these
occasions. But what has this to do with Botany
Bay? you ask. Well, nearly everything. We are
coming to it now.

lt is time to revert to Henry Kingsley :
“ At about this time (1787) the British Govern-
ment was Loginning to find out that hanging men
for petty iheft was a large mistake. Anyhow,
hanging did ro good. Transportation was tried,
and the great dominion of Australia f ounded.”
This is crisply put, but its accord with the
“ designs of Providence ” theory is not ap-
parent at a glance. The simple fact of the
matter is that the penal laws of England
at the time, and for fifty years after, were a
black disgrace to civilisation. Women and
children were hanged for shop-lifting to the value
of a pocket-handkerchief. Black Monday oppo-
site the Debtor’s Door at Newgate will not hear
description. One writer has this on a quite recent
aspect of the subject:—“A public execution in
London was a scene to fill an observer with some-
thing like loathing for the whole human race.
Through all the long night before the execution
the precincts of the prison became a bivouac
ground for the ruffianism of the metropolis. The
roughs, the harlots, the professional robbers, and
the prospective murderers held high festival
there. The air reeked with the smell of strong
drink, with filthy jokes and oaths and blasphemy.
The moral effect of the scene was about as great
as the moral effect of a cock-fight. The soul took
its flight as if it were a trapeze performer in a
circus.” The Government began to think it just
as well if some of them took their flight to New
South Wales. The American colonies, having
just got their independence, refused any more
white labour. A philanthropic proposal to hand
criminals over to the slave-dealers of Morocco was
made in a Christian country, and rejected. Con-
s'gnmenta were sent to the fever-coast of Africa,
where they died off like sheep, under the lash. So
New South Wales was founded.
“D.”
Poor Wales missed Doncaster races this
year for the first time, and it now transpires that
he was frozen out and had the key of the street.
There are two lords, a duke, and a couple of
once wealthy members of Parliament in the
vicinity of Doncaster, and the Prince has patron-
ised them tnrn-about, and once a year he and his
gang have turned the premises upside-down and
scoffed late suppers and expensive drinks all over
the place, till the two lords got tired of it and
reso ved to pass. Next the faithful duke fell off,
and then Wales and his friends hung on to Christo-
pher Sykes, M P., till they ate that gentleman’s
income from £15,000 down to £BOO a year, and
then he went away to vegetate at a cheap pub. in
Germany. Mr. Chaplin, a red headed man with
an eye glass and a Punch-ltke profile, was
then the only resource left, and by dint c£
vigorously following Wales’s straight tips and
otherwise makirg himself agreeable, he lost
£150,000 in 12 months, when he found himself
with considerably over £2 a week to call his own.
He still hung out at his family mansion, however,
till he saw a notice in the paper that Wales and
about 40 roystering friends were coming down to
stay with him for the Leger, and then knowing
that he had hardly even a ham-bone to offer them,
he also fled to Germany and took refuge in the
cheap pub. where Christopher Sykes was already
located. So poor Wales never saw the races this
year, and passed his time Instead among a crowd
of stone-deaf relations at Copenhagen. It was a
woeful falling-off.
Away in the early sixties there stood—
and may still for all we know—a three-storied red
brick building next door to the butchering estab
lishment of a well-known sport of those days—
Jimmy Graham. This was known to Melbourne
arbizans, saving domestics, and thrifty “ bobbies”
as the “ Provident Institute.” It was bossed by a
fat gentleman named Porter, and had a “ Board of
Directors,” among whom were a solicitor, a
trading ship’s captain, and a retired shopkeeper
or two ; but, directors or not, Porter was boss. The
“ institute ” received sums in any amount—large
or small—on deposit, and into this: ha artizms,
servants, and bobbies of the good old days of Mel-
bourne, dazzled by the large interest allowed,
used to put their weekly savings. The usual
half yearly balance sheets were produced with re-
ligious punctuality, and the wage-earning classes
believed tna r in the ‘‘Provident” Institute they
had a safe and profitable investment. However,
one morning, in iha midst of a terrific “ brioif-
fielder,” an ugly, uncomfortable rumour went
forth that the institute doors had not
been opened. Half the artizans in Melbourne
dropped their tools and undid their apronstrings,
the girls tidied up \hMr back hair and got leave
for an our, the placid bobby saw the sirgint, and
“for God s i ake ” g t lave, and by noon a crowd of
some thousands had assembled out side the bnilding
clamorously demand ng their hard-earned coin.
One of the clerks—the only official who had the
courage to face the crowd—announced that the
manager, Porter, was nowhere to be found, and
that not a coin was in the coffers of the institute.
It was apparent that the whole of the assets were
made away with, chat for years the balance sheets
had been “faked,” the large interest paid and
dividends declared had all come out of the de-
posits, a-id that Mr. Porter had gone to Ca lao —
at that time the refuge for all absconding a windleis.
Certain of the directors were put upon trial and
suffered imprisonment, although we believe their
crime lay in placing faith in Porter. It ia many
years since this occurred, and we rake it up now
that it may serve as a timely warning.

“ The Red Lamp ” commenced to shine
at Sydney Royal on Saturday in the presence of a
full house. It is a touching story of a band of
energetic conspirators who started to blow np a
Czar—and failed. That is where the pathos
comes in. They failed. They had everything
ready for blasting the monarch into hash, and
had nothing to do but lead him softly by the
coat-tails to where their mine was laid, and then
touch a button aind send the frizzled Emperor
into space, blit at the last moment an editor in
evening dress flanked on the programme and
began to whang with his umbrella at the door
of the palace and yell for mercy. This sort of
thing has spoiled many a good conspiracy. The
average plot is divided now a days into three
parts—the man who gets it up, the party
who digs the hole, and the fellow who
gives the scheme away and gats kicked all
round for his idiocy, and is then officially
scalped and sent to Siberia. The author of the
“ Red Lamp,” makes a terrible misuse of
bis opportunities. All through he is filled with
a frantic anxiety to save the Czar from being
blown up, and he fills his drama with worshippers
of that hard-drinking barbarian, and employs a
crowd of smooth, smiling, lying, sleepy-lookiug
police spies to pick tbe man traps out of the Im-
perial coffee and the infernal machines out of the
pickle bottle. Even the democratic Yankee of
the first act becomes an admirer of Asiatic
savagery in the third, and refuses to shake
hands with a NHulls'-, who is washed quite as
clean as he is himself ; and the fourth act
is devoted to a scene of repentance, in which the
murdering Czar escapes his fate, and the
most enthusiastic of the conspirators dies
with a fork stuck in his back “for God atd for
Russia,” The “Red Lamp” is a well-written
essay on the beauties of tyranny, and, viewed as a
moral lesson, it is a disgrace to the stage of a
democratic land. As regards the acting, it is
first-class all through. Mr. G. W. Anson takes
the laurel crown as the wiliest and slimiest police-
agent who ever trod the surface of the earth ; and
next to him in order cf merit come Mr. H. H.
Vincent as the gruesome editor, Zazgulie, Mr.
Herbert Flemming as the democratic American
who won’t shake hands with a Nihilist, and Mr.
Philip Beck, who, the girls think, “ looks
lovely.” Captain de Burgh is chiefly notice-
able through the circumstance of his being a cap-
tain. Miss Isabel Morris scores a glittering
triumph in the part of the bloodthirsty Princess
Claudia ; but Miss Pattie Brown, as her daughter,
is more Interesting, because less murderous in her
tendencies.

“ Night B’rds,” at Sydney Gaiety, de
serves honorable mention among melodramas on
account of one startling novelty. Asa rule, the
great difficulty with which the stage murderer
has to contend is that of finding some place in
which to stow away the body, and Mr, G. L.
Gordon’s beli-toppered assassin solves the prob’em
by putting the corpse into the safe. Then he goes
about drawing fancy pictures of the dead man
turning green and slimy on top of the cash-book,
and decaying among the bills, and his business
goes to wreck because he dare not epen the iron
door for fear of a slippery, slushy “something”
falling into his arms and staring him in the face.
The victim, meanwhile, is not dead at all, and is
let out in time for tea by a nervous little burglar.
His srj aura in the safe, however, works a change in
his character, and he comes oit like a raging lion
seeking whom he might chaw. Being of a
muddle-headed disposition, however, he is of very
little use, arc! “Night Birds,” which is rather a
good piece with him In it, would be almost as
satisfactory if he were left out. Mr. George L,
Gordon, the author, plays very well as ’Any
’Awkins, but ’Any is halmost habsolutely bun-
necessary (the haspirates are put in here to keep
things square) to the progress of the story. Mr.
l esion’s John Hawkins and Miss Lily Dampier’s
deceptive American widow are probably the best
delineations in ths piece.

Avery successful amateur performance of
“ New Men and Old Acres” was given last Fxi-
flay at Sydney Gaiety, the proceeds being devoted
to the funds of the National Shipwreck Relief
Society cf N.S.W. Governor Carington and a
party from Government House lent enchantment
to the view, and thus encouraged, the funds rolled
in freely till tbe ticket-taker and the noble figure
■of Mr. Gunther, manager, were bathed in perspira-
tion. The theatre, which was kindly lent for the
occasion by Messrs. Foley and Dampier, was
crowded in all parts, and the performance proved
to be considerably above the ordinary amateur
standard. The cast was as follows:—Benjamin
Bunter, Mr. E. W. Wallington ; Birsenbalg,
Colonel E. Bingham ; Vavasour, Mr. A. Forbes-

The theatrical managers of Sydney have
been shaken up this week by a rather rough
report from the Colonial Architect’s department
as regards the security of the various places of
amusement in case of fire. Among them all the
Gaiety is apparently the safest in the event of a
panic, and it also seemingly takes tbe lead in the
matter of ventilation. Her Majesty’s ia well
Ventilated, but hampered in places with winding
stairs; the Criterion is tolerably safe, but smells
of disinfectants; the Opera House is described
as dangerous in parts and dilapidated all
over; the Royal comes in for a hearty,
all-round anathema; the Academy of Music
is old and seedy ; the Alhambra is overcrowded
with seats, and the Standard receives modified
approval only. Most of the theatrical lessees
have since written, stating that the Department
doesn’t know what it is talking about, and there,
for the present, the matter rests. Sydney has
certainly never yet come into the possession of
the ideal theatre, as it is understood for instance,
in Italy, where the buildings are required, among
other things, to be fireproof throughout, and to
open into a wide clear space or street on every
side,

Mr. J. Grant took a large and healthy-

Wales’ muddy birthday.

Embellished with anew act-drop and
smiled upon by the Governor and all his angels,
the Melbourne Bijou revival of “School for
Scandal ” made a toney start last Saturday night
as ever was. The drop was decidedly cheering,
the Gov. looked extremely pretty in his most
becoming beard, and the performance had much
to recommend it to favourable notice. Age {i 10
years) has not withered Sheridan’s comedy any-
thing worth speaking about, and it remains a
popular work on account of its easy morality.
Brough and Bouoicault’s company produce
a harmonious picture devoid of any bits
of broad effect. They have, somehow, re-
duced the comedy in size until the prin-
cipals are able to fill out their parts. Mr.
Brough’s Sir Peter Teazle, Miss Romer s Candour,
Mr. Eoyce’s Oliver Surface, and Miss Trevelyan’s
Lady Teazle, are satisfactory, but shrunken. The
two young Surfaces evidently got mixed in the
nursery. Sprightly Mr. Cecil Ward (whose sweet
lip-ticklers have been sacrificed to the barber in the
intern ts of art) is too light for Joseph Mr. Tithi r-
adge is not recklessly nough for the festive Charlc s.
If each were the other, bo'h would benefit by the
exchange. Mr. Boucicault, in the assumed voice
of a former character, makes a likely Backbite,
and there is life in the Crabtree of Mr. Cathcart.
The small part of Careless is dressed and played
in superior style by Mr. Laye It only remains to
say that Miss Boucicanll’s Marla looks like a
dainty catting from a “ Kate Greenaway” Christ-
mas card. There is not much for tor to do beyond
appearing lovely and unsophistisated, and Miss
B, does that lot perfectly. It is even observable
that simp’e Maria is hardly at home in a minuet
which brings down the curtain on the fl 'at act,
but how a minuet comes to he danced in Lady
SneerwelTs boudoir before dinner, H»avan only
knows. “ The School for Scandal ” will be talked
about, and ought to run for a bit.

There was huge business at all the other
Melbourne houses on Saturday. “ La Gioconda,’
the last rose of the Italian season, filled tne Royal
circle as full as a bey at a ban struggle.
“ Mikado,” with Miss Branam and ihe other now-
chums back from induced a wild rush
to the Princess’s. And the Opera House “ Com-
bination” started their third week with such
symptoms of vitality that it was necessary to
sling out the superfluous multitudes, and return
their prices of admission by main force. A drama
of well flavoured interest fetched ’em freely at
the little Nugget, where the new management is
now established on a firm basis. The two nigger
halls, a circus, and a few other trifles were look-
ing strong and well. This general prosperity at
the temples of sin is disheartening for the parsons,
who are beginning to complain of Sanday bud-
ness. Wet Saturdays and weak shows are best for
the collection-bag, dear ferends. Mr, timonsen’s
Opera Company give him a big benefit concert at
the Town Hall on the 19th, when the songsters
leave the Royal to George Darrell and the
“ Sunny South.”

The London Eba recently blossomed cut
into the following “ ad which requires a lot cf
thinking over ;
“ It has been stated in a certain newspaper that I hive
lost ray leg and substituted a wooden cne. I read this with
amazement and pain, and beg to inform t*e theatrical woxll
through you that it is wholly untrue. It has been reprinted,
and becomes serious. I havs taken legal advice on the
matter, and shall shortly take means to prove to the general
public that there is neither any truth in, nor any pretence
for, this cruel statement.—l am, sir, yours faithfully, Emily
Kennion."
Now, what we want to know is—how is Emily
going “ to prove to the general public” ihat her
leg is genuine ? It seems to be rather a delicate
matter to eater upon, and, as the British public is
prone to scepticism, we hardly see how the mat-
ter can be arranged unless she allows a represen-
tative aud’ence to inspect her feat. If they ar
tbe correct thing we presume the leg will be taken
for granted.

affections, and at the same time perpetrated the
vaulting bluff of declaring her more spotless than
the winter snow. Now, however, he has started
fooling round his little pansy-blossom once more,

Kyrle Bellew, the now celebrated London
actor —one of the best and most presentable
Romeos ever seen on the stage—who has played
with Mrs. Langtry and other swells, male and
female, was, II years ago, police-court reporter
for a Melbourne paper. One day he had the
audacity to pitch into the city beaks (among
whom was one of his own bosses) for
a certain decision. The next day Bellew
had to appear before the Full Court at the office.
“ You know,” said the Chief Justice, “ it wasn’t
the correct thing to do, considering that a man
from whom you were getting your bread was on
the bench.” “ Yes,” replied the gentle Kyrle,
“ and only bread," Bellew’s screw was not raised,
but he wrote no more metrical reports for that
paper, and the Melbourne D.T. presently secured
his brilliant services. Bellew was a clever ver-
sifier, but sometimes his effusions were rather
Frenchy in style, and on one occasion, when his
paper was defendant in a libel action, a report of a
robbery in a house in Lonsdale-streat, given in
12 Spenserian stanzas, was read to the jury to
negative the supposition that the paper was
entitled to play the part of censor morum. Bellew
is son of the late Rev. J. C. Bellew, the celebrated
preacher and elocutionist, and the news of his
father’s death arrived by wire in Melbourne
while a Press performance was being given in the
Athenaeum for his benefit, after he had just re-
covered from a long and dangerous illness.
Madame Lucy Chambers, Garnet Waloh, Bob
Whitworth, and a lot of other well-known people
took part in the entertainment. Beliew was not
told cf his father’s death till the close of the per-
formance, Kyrle had previously to this been
almost everything from a needle to an anchor,
lecturer for a panorama, newspaper reporter, and
goodness knows what else, and ho closed his career
in Australia by shipping as third mate of a vessel
going to London, although he knew no more
about navigation or seafaring than he did of
cracking up a blundering beak because he hap-
pened to get bread for brains from him. Bellew’s
Christian names in Melbourne were Harold
Dominick—either of which is quite as good and
well-looking as Kyrle. H. D. B. was once the
hero of a little romance which occurred, above all
other places' on earth, in an asylum for fallen
women. The daughter of old O’Keefe, the Sand-
hurst cheese-maker was being received as a
nun at the Convent of the Good Shepherd at
Abbotsford (Melb.), and a large and fashionable
audience had assembled in the convent chapel.
Beliew was there in his reportorial capacity, and
by the exigencies of the occasion was obliged to
stand all the time in a very prominent position.
He was young, exceedingly handsome —a real live
Romeo—and dressed as only Beliew could dress.
Amongst the audience was the lively and ac
complished daughter of a London bigwig,
who was smitten by the sparkling per-
son of the gay Bellow, and after the service de-
manded an introduction. But to her dis-
may, she was warned that the handsome young
gentleman had only a short time before led to the
altar a French actress well-known on the Mel:
bourne stage, and that, therefore, his heart and
hand were engaged beyond re cal, But even that
didn’t qui'e cure her of her fascination.

a good many kinds of kanaka inspectors in the

were sent up to see if charge of air wou’d save
them from sinking into idiocy. When the e
gentlemen get officially irritated they are very
wild, and one of them recently suffered serious in-
juries through overbalancing himself while trying
to pound the hinder part of a kanaka with a

leaving him to recover in an arm-chair.
Dear Bulletin, —I have not the cacoethes
scribendi to-n’ght (my mate says that must mean
“ got ’em again ”), hut I must be heard. You are
on the Drink question once mere, and I have no
reison to alter my opinion that it was criminal
neglect, or perhaps intentional fraud, that pre-
vented the Commission from examining expert?.
I leave the town hooves to be regulated by Barry,
Morau, and Mackellar, whe pretend they know all
about it, bub when it comes to bush swiping I
pass to none as an adept and professional. It is
not drink that hyrts. It is the want of it. I:
a man gets his nip, nobbier, ball, wine, peg,
shot, tot, o: v h ite ver you call it, as in all other
countries, when he wants it, the edds are
ten to oi e that that man is seldom drunk—and
still the trade would not mnci suffer. But while
the Commission (which I help to pay) are fiddling
wth Bish ps and taetotalie s, I am seeking res .
and refreshment in a country town after spliitirg
posts for three months. De I get rest 2 Not in a
pub. Do I get refreshment ? Not from doctor, d
grog. The want in pubs, is sitting reom,
or lounging room. You can’t do anything but
slog it in, when jammed in a stuff/ bar fall of
town (bush-town) loafers. Here I remark that a
bush-town loafer is a more contemptible skunk
than any city beer-eater—and most of them are
young or middle-aged. If the Legislature
would enact that plenty of public sitting
space, not to be used as a meal-table
were supplied in every hotel, my mates and
I could avoid the red-necktie mob ; and to carry
the matter farther the Town Councils should snp,
ply benches away from pubs , so that we could
rest and suffer our recoveries in peace instead of
returning to the pub. or humping the drum to the
bend. There is one thing beyond all dispute, and
that is : No license should be renewed for a pub-
lican who allows local sharks to loaf on his cus-
tomers, or in whose house a local larrikin has
more than once attacked a drunken man. The
remnant of the Drink Commission is welcome to
my remarks: 14 I don' i see no pints about that

HEADACHE.
Headache is an exceedingly troublesome as well
as very prevalent affection, and in most cases is
of a nervous character, or results from some
nervous cause. In many cases the pain will be in
the forehead over and between the eyes, while in
o hers cases it will be a dull, heavy and oppressed
ft eling rather than a pain. Often the pain will
be in one or both temples, attended at times with
a throbbing which the slightest motion aggravates
or increases. The top of the head is frequently
the seat of the trouble, and the pain and disagree-
able sensations are very annoying.
Without doubt the most serious headache, and
one if allowed to programs and become more and
more frequent in its attacks, will result in some
alarming nervous affection like cerebro spinal
mei ingitis. paralysis or epilepsy, is that of the back
of the herd or upper portion of the spine.
In such cases the pain is generally of the
character of a du’l ache, with more or less stiffness
in the neck, or a feeling as it the head were partly
disjointed from the spine. This form of headache,
while not so frequent as the others, is much more
dangerous, and demands immediate attention.
Another kind of headache, and one productive
of the most intolerable suffering, is the so-called
sick headache. This, like the others named, is a
purely nervous headache, but there is added to the
anguish of the head a sickness at ths stomach,
which makes the disease doubly difficult to bear.
The headache popularly called “nervous head-
ache" is not confined to any particular spot or
portion of the head, but the head seems to ache all
over. The sick headache is in reality the sane
affection, there simply beiog an extension of the
disease until it involves the pn umogastric nerves,
or nerves weier go direct f om the base of the
brain to the stomach.
All the above forms of headache are of a nervous
character, and are caused by a weakness,
irritation or disease of the brain tissues or nerves
of the head, and in order to re'ieve or Cure such
cases, it is absolutely sec ssary to use a nerve
remedy, which, by acting directly upon the
affected portions of the nervous system, restores
their natural and healthy condition.
Now, having explained the cause of headaches,
the next thing necessary is its treatment and cure.
This has for some time been a disputed question
even among physicians, bud we believe at present
that it is acknowledged by all that Warner’s safe
nervine is the best possible remedy for these
painful affections. At least, it is conceded by all
that this medicine is the most certain of all known
preparations for the cure of headaches, and we
have never seen or heard of a case which it will
not cure. This remedy is purely vegetable, and
being perfectly harmless, can be used freely
in all cases of headache, and with an absolute
certainty of beneficial results. We most emphati-
cally advise against the use of poisonous drugs in
such cases, as not only are they useless as far as
a cure is concerned, but they are always injurious
to the system. This is another reason why we so
strongly recommend Warner’s safe nervine as it
can do no possible harm, and its use always
relieves and euros the disease.

“ An Abstainer ” writes to the Melbourne
Herald touching the difficulty of finding salva-
tion in an odour of onions. He says that the
practice which some people make of “attending
church after eating vegetables of this kind ” is
calculated to destroy in other worshippers that
blessed spirit of love and charity which should
prevail during service. Here we have a real
grievance. Many a miserable sinner may trace
his downfall to an evel-smelling “Amen’ dis-
turbing his devotions, and provoking him to curse
in church-T-
The iron-hoofed legendary pa who treads
flown the sweet flowers of affection as they blos-
som on his daughter's soul, and lets the dog loose
on her lover at the front gate, has pretty nearly
become a myth, if, indeed, he ever had any exis-
tence at all. The path of love is now strewn with
victuals and drink instead of being paved with
bricks, dogs, boots, and hot, hot curses, and the
pa of to-day nearly breaks his back bowing to any
promising youth who is willing to pay his
daughter’s board and washing for evermore. But
there are exceptions. Some parents are can-
tankerous. and one, a boot builder at Egerton
<Vic). has lately given way to what might he
called violence. He had a down on his daughter s
young man, somehow, and used to throw rakes
at him and harass him with an axe-handle, so the
lovers had to meet at the back of the farm-yard,
and utter soft nothings among the pigs. But one
moonless night they sat down on a log and talked [
happily of the future, and then the log keeled over
and sat on them while they screamed their heads
off and yelled for help. They had been sitting on
the old mamma pig, and she had struck. Their
cries brought out the old man and when he had
dragged the pig away by its little curly tail, he
fell oa the youth and pounded him till his head
looked like a raw pudding that had been kicked
by a horse. The rest of the story shows how ter-
ribly the fighting parent of ancient legend has
degenerated. The lover was in bed for a week,
and when he recovered he gave the old man the
choice of either going to gaol or bestowing his
blessing upon their union. He knocked under
and gave the blessing, and they are married now.

Here is an item of Court’ news, sent us
from Melbourne by Lord Carnarvon, or somebody.
Her Gracious is reported to be pegging away at
more “ Journal in the and other
literary labours, and there is a senna of Batten-
berg cursing in kilts on the grey hillsides of Bal-
moral. Victoria rises early on these damp, cold
jmorniegs, and sits most of the day in fireless
rooms with the window open, which makes the
Court sneeze its head off. She spends the fore-
noon mostly in wading through Prince Leopold’s
speeches, and the effusions of that ricketty youth,
who was of weak intellect and subject to epileptic
fits, are shortly to be inflicted once more upon a suf-
fering country. This labourgoes on till Her Majesty
can distinctly hear the attendant maids of honour
going mad, and then she sheds a few tears over
the bust of Albert the Good, and luncheon ensues.
In the afternoon the Queen goes out and pounds
through the slush with some unhappy followers,
and presently sits down on a damp stone to
admire a tomb, while the Court closes tbe window
and tries to get the shivers out of its back. Then
there is a heavy dinner, and the sodden household
drowns is sorrow by emptying hash into its coun-
tenance, and the rest of the evening Her Majesty
dozas in an arm chair, and wakes up now and
then to make some cheerful remark about the
ever-lamented. During the day Battenberg seeks
relief by wildly flogging his gee-gee over the hills,
and after dinner he sits and regards his mother-in-
law with a fishy stare, and blushingly hauls down
his kilts Occasionally, by way of lending an
aspect of festivity to the landscape, a Presbyterian
minister is invited to the royal table, and by
special permission expounds his views on hell, but
this dissipation only takes place at long intervals,
and the rest of the time is spent in solemn lan-
guishing.

A
A MONGOLIAN REBUKE.
CUSTOMER: “AH, JOHN, ME WANTEE UMBRELLA, YOU GOT CHINA SLIPPER,
TOO?”
JOHN: "AH! YOU CHINA MAN?”
The old hen-convention of Sydney teeto-
tallers are growing bloodthirsty, and their row is
like unto one boiler-making establishment, one
Parliamentary discussion, and 6000 midnight
cats. One Knapp got hold of a gory legend of
how the Sultan of Morocci was asked by an
American parson to use his “ influence ” to abolish
beer and tobacco in his dominions, and how that
thundering Moor used his influence accordingly,
and what came of it, Morocco, it seems, was re-
formed in one day. Eariy in the morning the
royal saved boozer issued his ukase ordering all
tobacconists to burn their goods in the great
square of the city, and all the rum-sellers to pour
their stocks into the river, and when they had
obeyed he had the whole crowd of them flogged
within an inch of their lives, and rotten-egged,
and dead-catted, and drenched with water, and
pelted with mud, bricks, rats, and snakes, and
thrown to a raging mob which chased them about
seven miles, and Anally they were banished, and
the cause of teetotalism triumphed. Morocco has
since then been run on local option principles—
that is to say, the local liquor-seller has the option
of being beheaded or suffocated with ancient eggs.
This story appears in the form of an advertise
meat in the S.M Herald, and following it comes
this moral reflection :—
- p 3 —Who would have thought that a few words uttered
by the above American min’ster to the Sultan of Morocco
would have accomplished what it did ? . . . The power of
persuasion is sometimes very great."
Yes, dear teetotal friends, the power of “ per-
suasion” is remarkably great at times. If we
had such powers of “persuasion” at command,
for instance, we could make every teetotaller in
Sydney get quite drunk and tear round the Domain
mit nodings on, cursing the Queen’s Fund, and
the Parkes Fund, and the mysteries of M’Namara’s
lease, and other sacred things. There is much to
be effected by persuasion.

Down South they have just gathered up
the remains of a parson in a jug, and poured him
into a bed of suffering where moth and rust doth
corrupt, &o., and the bruised and miserable sin-
smiter says he will probably be crippled for life.
An unsanctifled young man has shivered his gas-
light and burst his crust, and this, dear friends,
was why and how he did it. The week before last
the afflicted devil-hunter received a visit from a
colonist who was evidently suffering from tem
porary insanity, and who said he wanted to be
‘ 1 hitched ’’—that was the term he used. And he
was hitched accordingly. The bride measured
five feet eleven in her stockings, which were red
with blue stripes, and was a hefty creature all
round, and as he joined them the weak and
humble wessel felt glad that he was not the bride-
groom instead of the other man. But the other
man somehow fancied from his looks that the
squasher of iniquity had fallen in love with
his tremendous girl, and he was filled
with the gall of malignity, and proceeded to
put up a game on him He took him aside and
told him that his neighbour Duncan McKim was
also going to be married in a day or two,
and that he ought to get the job, and he
altogether neglected to mention that his own
comprehensive darling had been engaged to
McKim, and had only jilted him a week pre-
viously. So when the parser wrote to Duncan
and told him that he was prepared to put him
through cheaper than any other paralyser of the
ungodly, and referred to the job he had just com-
pleted as proof of his abilities, McKim gave way
to evil passions, and came along and sent in his
card. The servant showed him up just as the
shepherd was browsing over his evening meal,
and he came in with a Sioux war- whoop and
drove the good man’s head into the plate of chops.
Then he poured the milk down his back, and the
battle raged in earnest. The air was filled with
flying tea-things, oaths, hair, skin, gore, bits
of clergyman, curses, whiskers, and sulphurous
exclamations. At one moment the parson would
be driven into the mantel-piece ornaments and
asked what he meant by it, and a second later he
would be lifted up and brought down with a
whop on the butter, and told to take that. Then
his feet would be shoved through the window,
and the next instant he would be jammed under
the grate, or squashed into the piano, or brought
down with a sounding smite on top of the hot
teapot. It was the cheerfullest five minutes the
skirmisher in the good fight ever experienced, and
his enemy only gave up when he could no longer
find a clean place to hit him on. And when it
was all over tho victim took his bruised and
wretched way to bad, and lay there groaning and
wondering what it was all about. If this should
chance to meet his eye, it may possibly shed a
light on the matter.

The great Centenary is close at hand, and
all New South Wales is to curse and pray and
drink. Australia is to be filled with the sound of
swallowing, and there is to ha anew issue of
post age stamps to be licked by a loyal genera ion.
The mother colony is to shout for all the distin-
guished men of Australasia till they are red-nosed
with bolting hoo coffee, and ghastly with pie and
pork, and Papkes is to hand out buns to all-comers.
A sum of £7OOO is to be invested ina showof carrots
and horned catde, and there is to be a boat race for
‘ * The Hundred Years Cup,” and—well, thatls about
all. The Centenary is to be the largest biliousness
on record and nothing more. A voluble citizen
signing himself “Edward P. Swain” lately wrote
to the D T. suggesting that a great fleet should be
hired, and all the prominent men of N.S.W.
should go ashore in leg-irons at Botany Bay by
way of reproducing the scene of Captain Phillip's
landing, but n ibody took any notice ef him. He
also wanted a great corroboree, did Edward P.
Swain, but Parkes’ majority did not see the fun
of taking off all their clothes and painting them-
selves black, and dancing, howling, and waving
clubs on a muddy beach, and this also fell
through. Furthermore, it was recommended that
a great procession should be formed consist ing of
the surviving “direct descendants of the
first settlers,” but the tottering sons of the
original celonists did not corns forward to do
honour to their much-spanked parents, and the
scheme by which Parkes was to bo carried to
“some fit spot” on a shutter, and there make a
speech, was also frozen out. In fact, everything
has been frozen out pretty much ; even the great
plan by which the whole population was to carry
bricks to the Dead-house Park and heave them
down in a heap for the girls of the future to sib
upon with their young men has gone to pot, and
the idea of killing all the rest of the niggers has
burst, and the inspiration by which everybody
was to get into anything he liked, from a train
down to a cab, and go anywhere he liked
without paying a cent, has caved in, and
nothing is left but the new stamps and
the prospect of a haggard multitude scoffing pies.
When the long-looked for week of rejo’cing even-
tuates strangers will b j gathered in from the ends
of the earth that they may watch a great nation
getting tight, and long before the fifth day arrives
Parkes and Abigail will he chased through the
streets by a vast multitude all seeing snakes, and
will be forced to swarm up a tree in the Domain
and ro)st there till the clouds roll by. These
things make us feel sad. We will go to bed and
not get up any more till the Centenary is over.

Joe Bragg is in trouble again :—
The surprise-party is now afloat at Mel-
bourne. The other night 22 gibbering aristocrats
who keep butlers, coats of-arms, crests, and other
marks of ancient descent, loaded up a buggy and
a tip-dray with unctuous pastry, bulgy cake,
cooked fowls, and liquors, and rushed the house
of a merchant prince out in Toorak They entered
warbling an operatic ditty, and the string-band
which came behind them scraped joyous melody j
The owner of the premises proved to be absent at
the office or something, but they pervaded the
house all the same. They put the bulgy cake on
the piano, and the unctuous pastry on the plush
drawing-room suite; they planted toothsom
dishes on the mantelpiece, and liquors on the
ottomans, and laid great bags of fruit on the floor
and then stepped on them. They t fid the mis-
tress of the establishment to make herself at
home, and scared the baby into convulsions, and
sent the cat, with a swollen and congested tail,
up the chimney; they made .the melancholy
watch dog awa v e and bay the moon, they played
sweat music, and they also turned the furniture
endways and split gravy on the carpet, and trod
on the curtains, and the eleven ladles of the party
all “whished” simultaneously at the horrified
infant to sooth its fears. Then, suddenly, there
came a pause in the revelry. A voice in the pas-
sage sang ;
“ Tish the la-s-s-s roo-o-o-sh ot~Mc— shummah,
Lef bloo-oo-oo-ming—whoo-oop— dammit,”
The master of the house had arrived from the
office. His face was red and his eyes bulged out
till you could have hung your hat on them. There
was liquor and mud on his shirt front; his coat
had only one tail, and his hat looked as if it bad
been run over by a t-action engine. He glared at
the company and sang again : —
“ When the fa-eh lan’ o’— hie— Po — hie —
Washshrod by zhe -yah I Oh, Mosesh !”
He stopped then. The music stopped, so did the
feeding. The harassed mistress of the establish-
ment fell limp and crushed against the opposite
wall, and the irate husband sat down on a blanc-
mange and asked if thish wash the way— hie —way
slw went on while ho wash straggling to make
both ends— hi:— oo ? Had she fallen sho low ash
to bring a doshen men into the housh while he
was away labouring to—Ate ? He would fight the
whole crow-owd forsheven an’-shix and the gate-
money. And with that he hit one mao on the
ear and tipped him over an ottoman, and took
aim at a lady with the patbry and the surprised
party accomplished the promptest flea on record.
The head of the family spent the next day debat-
ing whether he would go roand and kic tall his
la it night’s visitors or hang himself to a rafter in
the hen-house. Case still proceeding.

VILE VIOLETS.
A POETIC PROTEST.
The perfume of the rose
It is pleasure to our nose
(Though by any other name ’twould smell as
sweet).
Our best girl’s Sunday dresses—
Her face, her hands, her tresses —
Their fragrance makes her nice enough to eat.
The breezy ocean brine,
The luscious ruddy wine
(Not to mention half-a-dozen other drinks),
As it issues from the bottle
And that everlasting wattle
Have certain subtle virtues in their stinks.
Or, the honey-snckle bloom,
Can make sweet a sitting-room,
And we musn’t leave the lilac in the lurch ;
But who can stand the scent
Of an onion-breathing gent.
As he offers up his little prayer in church ?
There is one vio let
Poets can’t abear, you bet
(Some say it gives a flavour to the steak),
Though it telleth of the spring.
It is not at all the thing
Which a Christian’s pew-companion ought to
take.
Charity, we bear in mind,
Long endureth and is kind ;
But the holiest of flesh is rather weak,
And oftentimes a saint
Cometh over sick and faint
In an atmosphere of onions, so to speak.
Then is it right and meet
That a worshipper should eat
Such vegetables on the Sabbath Day ?
How can his brother kneel
Through the Litany and feel
That he’s putting all impurities away ?
Six days the onion’s good
As an article of food,
But the Seventh Day it ought to have a rest
With the ass and patient ox.
For its pungent odour mocks
At piety the truest and the best.
Good Duncan Gillies, whose historic smile
Hath wizard power alike to charm or rile
In thee a man consistent we behoid.
With reputation bright as virgm gold ;
Fearless of waking friend or foam an s wrath
Thou keepest e’er in Duty’s narrow path;
The “ waiter's penny,” thy departing gift,
Is framed as proof of thy consistent thrift;
Though woman's smile hath lighted oft thy liK,
Constantly thou scorn st to choose a wife ;
The Freetrade principles of old profess t,
Were not consistent with thy interest,
So now we see the? sitting with a crowd
Of staunch Protectionists. Thy country s proud
Of Duncan Gillies—ne’er did Nature p an
A more (in some respec s) consistent man.
Alack-a-dayl Joe Bragg,
Did you reform in vain—
And has the ’verted lag
Returned to sin again 2
How weak is erring man ?
’Twas but the other day
That you, J.B., began
To walk the narrow way.
You wept for the misdeeds
Of many bygone years,
For true repentence needs
To vent itself in tears.
A simple child of grace
Yourself you then avowed,
Your interesting case
Gave pleasure to the crowd.
Yes, everyone was glad
To see the sudden change,
And murmured : “ Well, begad I
By Jingo! but how strange.”
“ His history so odd
A moral plain imparts—
’TJs wonderful how quod
Can purify their hearts.”
Alack-a-day ! Joe Bragg,
We fancy that the while
You merely were a wag—
A humourist in guile.
You chuckled in your sleeve,
And turned away to grin ;
We really do believe
You gloried in your sin.
You never left the track
That easy is and broad—
You never changed your tack,
And never loved the Board.
A lot of the old leaven
Is left in Joseph still;
You'll never gob to Heaven—
You know you never will.
Unless you drop in time
These old familiar tricks,
The profits of all crime
Are, in the end, but Nick's.

Legislative Council, during the discussion of a
new Postal Act, endeavoured to make it punish-
able to affix a stamp upside-down. Johnny was
terribly loyal.
“ Thus the “ Vagabond ” ; “I don’t know
Lord Carington; there are circumstances in his
career which naturally prejudice me against
him,” After this lofty snub Mr. Smith will please
take a back seat.
There’s a certain N.S.W. member of
Parliament who is better than a clock to the
messengers, “What’s the time?” “Look at
and see if he’s drunk ; if he ain’t, it can’t
be much after 11.”
A N.S.W. politician—not Parkes, but a
very hard-drinking friend of his —just now doesn’t
quite know whether it would be good policy to
threaten a huge libel-action against a certain
Sydney weekly paper.
Mr. Longstaffe—of “ Breaking-the-News”
fame —drew his first artistic portrait with white
chalk on a roll of black merino when he was em-
ployed in Colonel Sargood’s warehouse. The por-
trait was of the colonel.
At least one old Harrovian could truth-
fully plead that he was “ unavoidably precluded
from attending” the recent dinner of Harrow
boys at Menzles’ Hotel, Melbourne. He is doing
six months “ on the vag.”
It may not be generally known — nor is it
of much consequence, after all—-that George
Milner Stephen, whose faith in red flannel has
passed into a proverb, was at one time Acting-
Governor of South Australia.
The travelling expenses of Sir James
Lorimer and Alfred Daakin, the Victorian dele-
gates to the late Imperial Conference, amounted
to £1205 18a. 2d. The odd 2d. was probably a
gratuity to the night-porter at the Langham.
A brother of Edward Dwyer Gray, pro-
prietor of the Dublin Freeman’s Journal, died
recently in Sydney, where he was a private in the
N.S.W. Permanent Artillery. He was but 29
years of age, and had been educated as a surgeon.
A recently-executed French murderer,
■whilst admitting that he might flinch on the
scaffold, added, that “ what would upset him most
In the execution would be his inability to rub his
nose if the sawdust in the basket made him
sneeze.”
The Central Australian (Bourke)
brutally says “ The Parkes’ Fund is a tribute
to the genius of a man who spends £2OOO a year,
a lot of it on ornamental knick-knacks, lives like
a lord on credit, borrows from everyone, and pays
nobody.”
The cheerful Ninian Melville is not the
only undertaker who has had a seat in an Aus-
tralian Parliament. One John Cathie, a most
melancholy legislator, sat for Ballarat once in the
Victorian Assembly, Ho was, like Melville, a
cold-water man.
The duties of an Australian M.P. are
multifarious. The other day the member for a
district not a hundred miles from the Bogan re-
ceived the following wire from a constituent ;
“For God's sake send ns a sober barber ; ours is
on the drunk, and we haven’t had a decent shave
for over a week.”
A correspondent writing to the editor of
Melbourne Argus, says ; —“I sincerely trust, sir,
you will throw your weight into the scale in
favour of the good cause,” The last time Editor
Haddon put a penny in the slob and threw his
weight into the scale at Hobson’s Bay station
he turned just 16 stun.
As we are approaching our Centennial it
may interest many to know that the first baker in
Australia—one Bond, of Sydney—died in Mel-
bourne in 1839, aged 110 years He came out in
the first fleet and was the last man of that much-
ironed crowd. Whether free or bond, excepting
in name, history saith not.
John Robb, the railway-contractor (who
has never made a mess of a job for 25 years), will
for the next three years be engaged on that one-
in-fifty mountain line from Cairns (N.Q.) to the
Barron Falls. The work may be described as a
zig zag with curves instead of corners. Fifteen
miles will cost a quarter of a million.
Much fuss is being made by the Victorian
Press about the recent eccentric behaviour of a
Sydney Crown Prosecutor; but when a leading
Melbourne barrister made hia appearance at the
Criminal Court a few months ago in a very
advanced state of obfuscation, not one of the
local papers had a word to say about it.

AN EX-OFFICIO INVITATION.
ALGERNON DE POTTSPOINT: “I THINK, MY DEAR, WE’LL ASK THE SHERIFF
TO OUR LITTLE DINNER-DOOSED AMUSING FELLOW, THE SHERIFF”
MRS. DE POTTSPOINT: “BUT, ALGY, DEAR, WE’VE ASKED AS MANY AS WE CAN
SEAT ALREADY."
ALGERNON: “YES, MY DEAR, BUT IF WE ASK THE SHERIFF THERE’LL BE NO
CHANCE OF A BAILIFF COMING IN DURING THE DINNER, AS HAPPENED
LAST YEAR.” [Asked accordingly, nem. con.]
Francis Adams has a new volume of
poems in the press called “ Songs of the Army of
the Night.” They are a series of pictures of
London, Australian, and Eastern life, illustra-
tive of the horrible contrasts of misery and mil-
lionairism in modern civilisation, and cf the
Socialistic propagandism underneath it.
A country editor without hair or the fear
of a hereafter rises to comment on a N.S, W. politi-
cian in these words : “We under-estimated the
powers of malignity of Brute Me- , the black-
mouthed, blatant boss of ihe Parliamentary black-
guards.” And yet there are men who assert that
the Press is being overtaken with mental paralysis.
Still they come ! A Yorkshireman has
just unearthed a few more cartloads of relics of
Captain Cook. They include a fly-flap made from
the bone of a nigger chief’s arm, also a quantity of
rust-eaten flsh-hooks, “ and other articles too
numerous to mention. ’ This last observation
gives the enterprising and inventive auctioneer
clean away.
Boehm, the sculptor of the new Queen’s
Statue for Sydney, is the man who designed the
Jubilee coinage. Boehm’s failure is the subject of
intense jubilation among English sculptors, who
were exceedingly irate when the choice fell upon
one who is looked upon as an alien intruder, and
they contend that the result has amply justified
their wrath.
John Dixon, Church of England minister
at Wickham, Newcastle (N.S.W.), now removing
to Balmain, is a self-made man. He commenced
life amongst the black diamonds as coal-weigher,
and worked his way up. He made a mistake,
though, in the road he travelled. He should have
been a politician, and might have been of much
more service to his country.
An Irish publican in a large western town
in N.S.W. had a real live artist boarding with
him for some wOeka. He recently disappeared
with the night mall. The publican says he was
the most regular, consistent, and methodical
boarder he ever had. He never missed a meal,
and never paid a shilling. He declines, however,
anything so regular in the future.
The Recorder of Cork, who affirmed the
sentence of three months’ imprisonment passed on
Mr. William O’Brien, M.P., is J. P. Hamilton,
Q.C., brother-in-law of Dr, Brownless, Chancellor
of Melbourne University, and uncle of Acting-
Judge E. B. Hamilton, of Victoria —the gentleman
who presided at a meeting to welcome Edith
O’Gorman, the Escaped Nun, to Melbourne.
Sir Alfred Stephen retired from the
N.S.W. Bench in 1873, old age being the assigned
cause. He lives still, and carefully draws a big
pension. Of the Judges then on the bench, two —
Hargrave and Cheeke—are dead. His immediate
successor, Sir James Martin, is dead. Of the 27
barristers who attended hia final lev(se, seven, all
younger men, have gone to the grave, but the old
man lives on.
A London paper unblushingly asserts that
the reason why Battenberg is not popular with
the British princesses is that he has the reputation
of hardly ever taking a bath. Bat, is a delicate youth,
and on cold mornings he thinks it sufficient to soap
his countenance, and then give it a souse and a
polish, leaving the rest of him in an unirrigated
condition. Consequently—well, we don’t think
we’ll travel beyond the “consequently.”
A little Northern town not many hundred
miles from Sydney contains a modern Lot—a bad
lot—who has beaten the high toned record of the
English Colonel Hughes-Hallett by seducing his
bona fide step daughter. The “ gay Lothario,”
who is, by the way, old enough to be a church
deacon or an angel, has been chased over three
countries by the male relatives of the fair a ban-
donee, but being a good horseman the game has
hitherto escaped.
Thus the N.Y. Mirror, on Mrs. Brown-
Potter’s patron, “Wales” It is not believed
here that his favour, which is about equally dis-
tributed between shopkeepers and good-100 ling
amateurs, is of any intrinsic value whatever from
an art point of view. It is not even known here
that his personal reputaion is of that kind which,
aside from his accidental position, can confer any
advantage other than a damaging one upon a
chaste American lady.”
Mr. James Mirams, who has just been re-
turned by Williamstown to the Victorian Legisla-
tive Assembly, has a brother so like him that his
most intimate friends have a difficulty in distin-
guishing the one from the other. The brother,
who is postmaster at Fitzroy, has the same bald
head, the identical snub nose, the precise patriar-
chal beard which form the personal characteris-
tics of the lilliputian financier, and they both
measure (in their shoes) exactly 4ft. ilfin. It is
because of this remarkable resemblance that the
politician invariably carries an umbrella in de-
fault of being branded or ear-marked.
Ninian Melville says his father —who was
also named Ninian—built the Speaker’s chair of
the NS. W. Assembly. The chair occupied by
the Speaker of the Victorian House is that in
which sat —fifty years ago—Charles Manners-
Sntton as Speaker of the English House of Com-
mons. It was presented to the Victorian House
by his son, Viscount Canterbury, when Governo.'
of the Southern colony. The Governor's grand-
father was the Archbishop of Canterbury, and
when his son Charles resigned the Speakership
and went, as the rule was, to the House of Lords,
he fixed upon the Pilgrim City as the one from
which he would take his title.
Poor Turner, who practised for a quarter
of a century at Melbourne City Police Court as an
attorney, and died not long since, was a barrister
of the Inner Temple, who through ill-luck got into
the groove of a police-court practitioner of the
lower branch of the profession. He was an ac-
complished scholar and good-hearted man. He
frequently gave his services as interpreter of
continental languages In cases of emergency. It
was no uncommon thing for Turner to come be-
fore the bench as “ No. 15 pleads guilty, your
Worship,” and after paying his fine to take hla
place at the lawyers’ table and say, “If your
Worship pleases I appear for No. 16.” But some-
body prevailed on Turner to become a teetotaller
—and then he died.
While J. S. Butters, an ex-Mayor of
Melbourne, and once Prime Minister to King
Cakobau, of the Cannibal Islands, was visiting
London lately, a botchy cablegram to the Mel-
bourne press announced “ Butters dead"—which
was taken to moan J. S. Butters, As a conse-
quence, the Newcastle (N.S.W.) Herald, and
other colonial papers, published buttery obituary
notices. By and bye, however, it transpired that
it was not J. S. Butters, but a Reverend Mr.
Butters who had pegged out, so the papers had to
take back all they had said. The surviving But-
ters wired a message to the above-named paper as
follows From Victorian Exchange,—Just re-
turned. Climate too hot. Your friends are all
well, and expect you soon. Please send me a
copy of my obituary notice. —J. S. Butters,”
Miss Grace, sister of the cricketer, re-
cently scored 217 runs against the bowling of four
men.
Some interesting experiments will doubt-
less be tried by King Humbert on that Abyssinian
bishop he lately discharged from prison. Our
astute bush constables almost invariably make a
blackfellow cut a load or two of firewood before
informing him that the blind Goddess of Justice
has decided in his favour.
Thus an old veteran on “ Billy ” Caffyn,
bar Grace the best batsman England could boast
of, and who resided in Sydney for many years :
“It was a treat to stand behind the net and
watch him bat. I learned more watching Billy
than in all the practice I could ever get,” The
practice of watching might well be followed to
advantage by many of our rising batsmen.
Three-and-sixpence had been thrown on
the big drum at the Newcastle (N.S.W.) Salvation
Harmy parade the other night, and the captain
was exhorting his hearers to “ make it four bob,”
when a dirty aboriginal mutely grasped him by
the hand. The captain, overcome by this addition
to the saved, announced the joyful fact of the
blaokfellow’s conversion to the public, when a
suspicious move of the convert towards the big
drum and the money raised some doubts as to the
reality of the repentance. Thereupon the black-
fellow muttered something about rum, and re-
turned again to the ways of the unregenerate.
Scene : Certain Australian Court. Small
boy from merchant’s office presents a claim in the
estate of John Brown. His Honor ; “ Who pre-
sents this claim?" Small boy (in a state of
quiver): “I do, your Honor.” His Honor (to
small boy): “This claim is—ha, hum—void ab
initio. Kihil obstat that it can be—hum—filed,
but non constat that it—ha, hum —can be re-
ceived. The—ah— mattah will— ha, hum—have
to be —ah —dealt with de cursu. You—aw—may
begin de novo and—ha, hum —come here toties
quoties. But pray—hum—be nimble, my good
lad, be nimble.” Exit small boy, in a condition of
profuse perspiration.
A Forbes J.P. tells the following little
yarn of bribery and corruption. While J.P. at a
certain one-horse town in Australia, an “indivi-
dual ” wrote to him on two separate occasions
asking him to use his influence to get his name
placed on the commission, and each time offered
a “bonus ” of twenty pounds if it could be done.
The luminary refused on both occasions. When
the new magisterial list was published the other
day, the Forbes law-giver saw the name of his
corrupt correspondent conspicuously figuring!
Query : who was the other J.P who got the twenty
pounds ? Also, how does the first one feel when
he reflects on the reckless way in which he sacri-
ficed the cash ?
Daring one of Sir Psalmyell Griffith’s trips
to the Far North he got benighted, and had to ac-
cept the hospitality of a bark humpy owned by a
crank lost in the wilderness. This individ a! had
just received a blaokfellow’s mummy con .i up i. a
bag. and had put ic for safely under the pil ow,
and he forgo i to mention this circumstance before
the great visitor went to bad. But in the morn-
ing he put his head in at the door and enquired,
“ Did your honor see a corpse in here last night?”
“ Good gracious, no!” gasped the politician.
“Well, there was one under the pillow, and I
forgo: to take it away. P’raps it’s there yet.”
Then Sir Psalmyell sat up and searched. It was
there all right. He found it. “ Thank you,” said
the owner, as he hauled it out by the legs.
Dear Bulletin, —I never read the word
“ Wei she r ’ without calling to mind the piteous
spectacle of a poor devil hounded by a furious
mob, chucked over the rails, and running for dear
life in torn clothes down the run-in at Alexandra
Park, near London. He was pulled by the police
from under a hansom, and I in the look-up
for safety. The Saturday Review bad an article
on it, beginning: “The business of welshing is
easily performed. You give a man a sovereign ;
he gives you a piece of paste' ,*rd, and, so far as
you are concerned, the transaction is at an end.”
And now, concerning a colonial welsher, one
Brummy. B. held * e stuff at Geelong, and the
favourite won. B- B. “ couldn’t abear to part,”
so he repudiated lus debts, and was set on. He
then lay down, using the most abominable, filthy
language. Ore man remarked, “ He’ll get lum-
bered.” “Just what he wants,” said another.
So he was quodded, protected, and fined a fiver.
But he was all (minus £5) to the good, and I said
in my heart that the wicked prosper.—Yours
Hiram Abiff.

1 The Sydney Lancers have, in one respect,
taken the place of the recent Moses, for the pub-
lic want to know where they were when the
light went out. When Governor Carmgton
returned from Melbourne last week it was under-
stood that this ferocious corps were, as usual,
to be howling for blood outside the railway
station, and one officer actually was present
drawn up in a hollow square. But the privates,
alas I where were they ? The reason of the un-
happy commander tottered upon its throne when
he saw a single Lancer come round the corner.
Did he thank that Lancer ? Did he fall upon his
neck and shed tears of ioy to think that one
military sheep had got back from the wilderness ?
Not much. He told him to slide. “ For God’s
sake clear out,” he said. “ Disappear ! Fly 1
Get home the back way ! Do anything you like,
but get out 1 D’ye think I want to show
up here like an old hen with one chicken?
D’ye s’posa I’m going to figure as dry-nurse
to an orphan Lancer? Dont stand there
and bleat! Get out, blank you, get out 1 1 And he
went. The Sydney Lancers now consist of 15
officers and one man with a long spike, and a
smudgy circular has been sent round to the miser-
able absentees calling on them to send in Govern-
ment property consisting of a sword, a lance, two
buckets, one pair goloshes, a bottle of milk, a
Bath bun, and a lot of other sundries, among
which may bo mentioned a “neck rope”—pro-
vided, we presume, by a thoughtful Government
in case a Lancer should want to hang himself.
When they have returned these properties they
are to consider themselves a bounced regiment.
The corps are now going to sell off their uniforms
for use during the forthcoming pantomime season,
and the warlike trappings which should have
shone in the van of the battle, when the Lancers
charged with the invading enemy in front and the
bread-waggons in the rear, will come in handy
for “ Mother Goose and the Golden Egg.” How
are the mighty fallen, and the salt of the earth
knocked into a cocked hat which shall return
after many days !
* * *
A malignant desire to annihilate the old
man has brought lots of women to grief. Hun-
dreds of wives are now homeless upon the face of
the earth because they couldn’t let things slide
when the male motive of the establishment came
home with long hairs on his coat, and explained
that he had got them off a dog while sitting in the
parlour of a bachelor friend writing a poem, and
now one more victim is added to the list. The
other day a stranded female from Brisbane applied
to a London magistrate for means to pay her pas-
sage back to Queensland. She was married, she
explained, to a colonist, and in the course of a
patient overhaul of his letters when he
was out she had been led to the con-
clusion that he had another wife in England.
Consequently, she had come over to find the
horrid, nasty cat, and seize her by the hair of the
head, and, after spending all her money, she
ascertained that her husband’s other wife had
been dead for years. What she wanted, there-
fore, was some assistance to enable her to return
to the bosom of her supposed bigamist, and, as
the assistance was not forthcoming, the lady still
wanders through the streets of London and has no
place to go. Sometimes, as she sits on a doorstep
and weeps, she almost wishes she had stayed with
the old fogey at Brisbane, and not been so par-
ticular.

Lord Oarington has been presented with
a Jubilee medal by the Queen. It now remains
for Her Gracious to forward a nice Jubilee mug to

A Melbourne paper says that that much-
beloved institution of our boyhood, Guy Fawkes’
Day, is fast becoming obsolete, and the crackers,
squibs, and rockets are now reserved to celebrate
the birthday of Tummy, Prince of Wales. In the
face of this it ia not a wild conjecture to presume
that ere long the small boys will be trundling a
grotesque, lopsided effigy of H.R.H. round in a
barrow, and soliciting a penny from householders
in return for the privilege of beholding the guy.
“ Give a movement a bad name,” &c.
Well, the Sydney people wanted no “ Queen's
Fund,” and so, as we confidently expected, the
Mayoress’ ffite in aid thereof was an unqualified
“frost.”
* * *
Thus the S.M. Herald, in a rational
moment :
“ On Wednesday, just before the opening of the Mayoress's
fSte, a poor but respectable old widow woman, with her little
granddaughter, might have been seen eagerly scanning the
gaily-decorated stalls."
“Poor but respectable” is excellent. In the
Herald's opinion wealth is always reputable and
poverty completely vicious. The only respect-
ability the Herald really takes on trust is the
sort that attends the “levvys” and is drawn
about by two horses.
According to the Imperial Conference
Blue Book the Australian Naval Station is bounded
on the north by the parallel of 12' N. latitude, on
the west by the meridian of 95’ B. longitude, on
the east by the meridian of 160' W. longitude,
and on the south by the Antarctic circle. This is
startling news. Hitherto we were under the
vague imprersion that the what-you-may-c ill-it
was bounded on the north by Brisbane Govern-
ment House, on the south by Melbourne Cup, tn
the east by Potts Point, and on the west —well
not very west —well, let’s say by the Adelaide
Exhibition.

There is a registrar of squeals, croaks, and
wails—or births, deaths, and marriages, which
are just the same—in a small Victorian township.
He is a widower and a giddy old masher. He
fixed his eye on a young widow with plenty of
“ sugar ” and other sweetness, and she encouraged
his dalliance, even to promising him that he
should marry her. He carried on his recording
business, and chuckled to himself with glee at the
prospect of shortly owning the widow and regis-
tering his own marriage. As he sat ia his office
one afternoon the widow entered on the
arm of a local chalk-and-water distiller. The
registrar hopped round and was as gracious as he
could be. The dairyman cut him short by saying,
“ Look slippy, old man, we're goiog to getspllced,
and want you to post the notices.” The registrar
sat down on the floor as an ordinary chair did not
seem to fit him just then. “But, Mrs. Blank,”
he gurgled, “you promised 1” “So I did,”

Since the announcement that Lady Car-
ington is suffering from an inflamed knee, it has
been noticed that many of the “best people” in
Sydney are apparently afflicted in a similar way.
The inflammation, however, cannot arise either
from praying or from scrubbing. One can only
conjecture that “ housemaid’s knee ” ia an heredi-
tary complaint.

Constable Burke, of Sydney, who last
week chased and stopped a runaway cab, think-
ing that it contained a pretty girl, found that,
after all, he had only rescued an Insolvency
Judge—who, there being a compensation for all
things, gave him ten guineas and obtained for
him instant promotion. There is in this a mighty
moral. When you see the gaol-van bolting, don’t
forget to remember Constable Burke and his
Honor Judge Deffel.

" The other day the Anglican parsonage at
Toorak (Melb.) was burgled, and a lot of things,
including a lovely wringing-machine, stolen from
the laundry. The robbery was reported to the
Prahran police, and Senior-Constable O’Flaherty
was sent up to the parsonage to make enquiries
and examine the premises. He had an interview
iL ("on
Au'SfPAUiA"
with his countrywoman, Bridget, the laundress,
who gave him a lot of information, and a hit of
her mind as to how the things were got at and
carried off. “ Yis, that's all very well,” says
O’Flaherty, “but what bothers me is how the
divil they got into the belfry.” “Oh, what the
dickens ’d take them there ?” rejoined Bridget.
“ They’d get no more there than a church mouse,
and divil resave the much that is." “Oh, be
jabers, they got the ringin' machine," replied
the astute Michael.

It was in a tram-car, and the only passen-
gers were Parkins of the Civil Service, and five
ladies. Parkins was arrayed in a new ready-made
suit, and he contemplated them and his tight boots
with joyous satisfaodon till he noticed a thread
hanging to one leg of his lovely trousers. He
took a chance when the ladies were looking the
other way and nulled. Ab out a yard of thread
came out. and Parkins gave a gasp. He hauled
on it again and brought out two yards more, and
then he grew desperate and dragged out six yards
altogether, whan the line bro&e off. “ Thank
heaven 1 ” he muttered faintly as he dropped his
leg, and as he drooped it the whole pant came
open from the foot right up to the pocket.
For one awful moment Parkins and the ladies
were paralysed but at last one blushing little girl
offered him a pin, and the miserable object hitched
himself together and got out. The only place of
refuge he could see within miles was a milliner’s
shop and on payment of an extravagant bonus he
was allowed the use of an upstairs back room,
where he took the clothe 3 off and shied them out
of the window to a girl waiting in the yard, bhe
went off to run them through the machine, and
the other girls stood romd under the window and
made remarks, and when the damage was re-
paired they all took a hand at throwing the gar-
ment back through the casement. They landed
it amid great excitement at the thirteenth shot,
and then they stood in the passage —22 of them—
and tittered as Parkins came out, and while he
was settling up, the old lady in the shop gave him
her card, and told him to run in any time he
wanted some repairs done. He said he would.

Poor Wales has not yet fully recovered
from a shock he received some months ago, and it
is doubtful if he will ever be quite himself again.
It was at Sandringham that the cataclysm oc-
curred. Sir Frederick Johnstone got “ off”—woe-
fully “ off” —at dinner, but by a superhuman effort
he held himself together until the ladies were
gone, and then he concussed into a chair by the
fire and closed his eyes. Wales viewed his pal for
a few moments in sorrow rather than in anger,
and then he strolled up to him and said in
solemn gutturals: “I say, F-r-r-r-edy, yourr-r
ver-r-r-y dr-r r-unk.” If the heir-apparent had
been kicked in the eye he could not have been
more staggered when the answer came back:
“ P raps ; but, I say, Tummy, you’re very fat.”
The house door opened shortly afterwards, and a
baronet was fired out.

The Parkes Tribute people have got hold
of the £6B surplus remaining from the lata N.S.W,
railway demonstration. It has gone to that fund
which is so carefully protected from Parkes’
numerous and deserving creditors, and as it was
universally understood that it was to be handed
over to some hospi-
tal or other cha-
rity, the subscri-
bers are beginning
to kick when it is
too late. But, some-
how, charities all
go the same road

An anecdote of the late Lady Brassey.
When she was plain Mrs. Brassey, a few years
ago, she went into a London upholsterer’s and

guineas, Madame. Very few people care about
giving so much for a chair.” “ Hum !” ejaculated
Mrs. Brassey, “ send me a dozen, please.”

A clergyman at Dunolly (Vic.), finding

The Argus, in an unlooked-for glimmer of

one is inclined to ask for whom it is pleading in

The death of the Irish peer, Viscount
Guillamore, was recently announced. The de-
ceased lord had a little colonial history. He was
one of nature’s gentlemen, and when in the
colonies did not hang about Government House,
or make multy bets with bookmakers. He was
shepherding on a back run in Victoria in 1860
when he picked up a portion of a colonial news-
paper which contained the announcement of the
death of his brother and invited him home to
the ancestral halls.
Parer and Barbeta, the great Spanish
caterers, are apparently bidding for a monopoly of

Quite the sweetest little thing in photo-
graphs at present is a two-ahiiling article with
the foot-note, “ The Princess of Wales assisted in
her study of the Bible by the Bishop of S?.
Albans.” The Princess is studying the Bible in
evening dress—if she were a man it might be
supposed that she had wrestled with the Scrip-
tures until she was compelled to take something
off to cool herself—while the Bishop is tackling
the Word with all his clothes on. This photo, has
caused a great religious revival among the upper
classes, and ladies of all descriptions now invite
bishops, vicars, high-church parsons, local-
preachers, and Salvation Army captains to call
and assist them in studjing the Bible. It is also
suggested that a portrait of “ The Princess of
Wales praying at her bedside ” might do a lot to
boost the neglected subject of private devotions,
and another two shilling photo, will probably ap-
pear shortly, with a view of inducing duchesses and
others to offer up a petition before going to rest.

The aristocratic suburbs of South Yarra

The doctor is a gay young sport of 80. A few
years ago an Age reporter went out to South
Yarra to ask him how his patient, the late Were,
C.M.G., was getting on. “Badly,” replied the
doctor. “ Well, he’s an old man,” remarked the
reporter. “Only seventy-five,” rejoined young
Wooldridge. “You don’t call that old? I'm

The white man who would grovel to a
Chinaman is lower than the ancient cat-worship-
per of Egypt, and meaner than the heathen who
used to bow down before an onion. Tne latter
abased himself before a chan vegetable, while the
man who bows to the Chinkie does reverence to
the object which dirties the vegetable by heaving
sewage on it. Consequently we do not share in
the enthusiasm which led the inhabitants of some
place in Victoria to assemble together and present
Chin Chew with a testimonial on the occasion of
his departure for a short excursion to Leper Land.
The affair came off in the local hotel, and
the company made speeches, and drank
toasts, and expressed a hope that Chew would
speedly return with the glow of health in his
yellow oountenancs and joy in his fishy eye, and
as the local paper puts it, “ Mr. Chin Chew suit-
ably responded.” This is probably something like
what ho said, “Clistian pleachy man he makee
me heap sick. Me live in Victolia thilty year,
sell good cabbagee, olange, callot, and lalbkin, he
thlow stones all the time. Me go back to China,
get away from goly lallikin. Bynaby me come
back, sell good ca v >bagee, olange, callot, allege
same.” Then Chin Chew’s health was drunk
again, and the heathen slouched out on his road
to Shanghai. And this is what the white man
has come to. We feel half inclined to go out and
offer up a short prayer to our dog in the yard,

According to clause 211 of the N S.W.
Criminal Law Amending Act, ‘' Whosoever
maliciously kills maims or wounds any cattle shall
be liable to penal servitude for ten years.” That
may be all very well; but clause 221 of the same
Act says: “ Whomever maliciously and cruelly
wounds or tortures any cattle whether his own
property or that of another shall be guilty of a
misdemeanour and be liable to imprisonment for a
term not exceeding twelve months or to a fine not
exceeding £100.” In other words, if a man shoots
his neighbour s calf dead, at once, he is liable to
be imprisoned for ten years ; but if he takes his
own, or anyone else’s, cow, smears her over with
kerosene and sets her alight, the greatest punish-
ment that can be inflicted on him is a twelve
months’ seclusion. As Judge Docker says, this
Act is “a most idiotic piece of law-making.”

In the matter of Home Rule, it will be

The Argus considers that “ the inaugural
dinner given by the Mayor of Melbourne is de-
prived by circumstances of much of the political
importance which attaches to the entertainment
at which, on the same evening, the Lord Mayor
of London inaugurates his year of offlos.” That’s
a long-winded way of insinuating that Duncan
Gillies is a out below the Grand Old Man, or Lord
Salisbury, and a molest admission that Victoria
is not yet one Of the Great Powers. All of which
is true enough. Thera’s the same difference be-
tween the two feeds that there is between the
Argus and the Times, One is heavy, but im-
portant ; the other is heavier—but not important.

BOURKE, loth September, 1887.
LN November, 1885, my family were residin? ia
Nyngan, and my wife and I were apprehended
on the charge of having damaged the bellows of a
neighbouring blacksmith, but the esse was ulti-
ma'ely disr issed. On our committal for trial our
two boys, aged respectively 10 and 8 years,
boarding at an hotel at the time, were taken poa-
res-ion of by the pWe. and sent away to Sydney,
be ng placed on h. art of the Vernon tramirg
ship At the time oc our misfortune the childr n
were being educated at the Convent ii Nyngan,
and I hold certificates from the Sisters as to pay-
ment of fees and na'u e of the instruction im-
parted. After the children v ere feat to the
Vernon, the younger was removed and placed in
the hands of Maxted and Green, of the Children's
Relief Department, Paddington. Mr. Ryan,
solicitor, applied to the Government while both
were on the Vernon, but could not get (ham on
account of the adverse report of the Nyngan
police. I applied personally to Dr. Renwick for
ihe elder boy on the Vernon and to Maxted and
Green for the younger. I have been over
30 years in Riverina, travelling the country
or working in the towns as a saddler I
and had my head-quarters in Nyngan for eleven
months, my family residing there while I was
working at my trade on the stations in the district.
Maxted and Green demanded payment from me
by letter for the support c£ the younger boy in
1886, and early this year, ge ting from me in all
three payments of £2 10s. each. On farther
anpl'cafon for money they were referred to my
legal adviser, since which time they have not
troubled me with any farther demands. The
first letter I got from Green, who stated that the
ra’e of his department was to pay five shillings
per week for each child for six months, then the
child would be returned to h!s paren's provided
they had a home to put him in. I urged Green to
school the child properly, and he promised to do
so, but Mrs. Hogan's interview with the boy led
her to believe that this matter had almost totally
been negleoted, ard on advertising for the child
littly to find out his whereabouts, I having be-
come acquainted with full particulars of the bad
treatment he received when sent or let out to per-
sons by the Relit f Department, can entertain little
hopes of his havirg received any instruction
whatever. Mrs. Hogan lately went to Sydney
and applied to Mr. loglis, Dr. Renwick’s succes-
sor, but was by him threatened with the police
and refused admisdon to the Vernon to see the
elder boy. Maxted adopted arc other course, when
she applied to him for tbe younger boy, first tell-
ing her to get from (ho Bourke police a character
for herself ard husband for the past twelve
months, after procuring which he referred her to
the Vernon to get the elder boy first, then he
would hand over tho younger to her. Without
great influence she could not poesibly get the boy
from the training-ship, and well Maxted knew
this, hence, in all probability, this shuffling policy.
Tne Relief Department has been letting out the
child to several parties, and among others to a
farmir at Wollongong, who was prosecu ed for
ill treating him, having beaten him on the naked
breast with nettles and crippled one of his hands.
Mrs Hogan was also put off with flimsy excuses
on tach of her visits to the Relief Department,
Maxted telling her at one time that the child
would be handed over to her, ard at another time
that there was no possibility of his being
given up to h'r. On one occasion he let
hm know very plainly that he did not .like the
father's having advertised for the child in the
Evening News. Seeing it useless to remain in
Sydney any loiger, she returned home to Bourke,
and now the matter is to be brought before Parlia-
ment at the next sitting. My case is a very hard
one, as the elder boy was, at ihe time of removal
tn the Vernon, receiving a better educa'ion at the
C i vent than he would be at all likely to get rn
the snip ; he had also partaken for the first time
nl the sacrament as a Catholic, and was in every
w*y getting on to the entire satisfaction of his
te ichers. This can be proven at any time, and
all letters received from the Relief Department
have been carefully put on one side for proiucti-n
in evidence when required. Not wishing to say
more than I am able to prove, I place this state-
ment before the public, and all who read it can
draw their own inferences.

Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken two
or three times a day; a wineglassful for an adult,
smaller quantity for children.
For general Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of Dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any other medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin Disease will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals, diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the Quantity twice a day.
THEY PURIFY THE BLOOD AND LIVER.

Gentlemen,—l great pleasure in recom-
mending Row’s D anelion Bitters. I have been
suffering for several 3 ears with Liver complaint,
and bean under several doctors for it without any
curative result. I have only taken two bottles of
your Dandelion Bitters, and feel quite a different

all who suffer from Liver complaint to try them, —
Yours,

Read an expression of thankfulness received by
the undersigned:—
“ I have for many years been obliged to take
medicines of different kinds fcr affections of the
liver, indigestion, pain in the chest, general de-
bility, feelings of nervousness, weariness, great
depression of spirits, and so on, but all without
producing any beneficial effect, till at last, being
recommended to try ROW’S D\N DELION
BITTERS, which, happily, I find has produced an
unexpected and wonderful effect and change In
my system, and has removed from my mind the
horribly depressed feeling and former condition of
bodily ailment I have so unhappily experienced
for so many years.
“ I am glad of the opportunity to make known
Ihe excellent qualities of ROW’S DANDELION

been may take advantage of them.

Mary Nerney, the defendant in a will case
juib heard in Sydney, seems to have had a
glorious time of it before her lamented pegged
out. He used to take 30 or 40 nobblers a day, and
under these circumstances he, on one occasion,
took a large quantity of hair out of her head,
which hair, she slated, “ she had kep!% as she
thought of having ij made up in a plait.” It
isn’t every woman who could calmly gather her
torn-out thatch from the floor under such painful
conditions, but probably Mary had got used to it.
When Nerney was on his last legs the “ praste ”
came to see him, and Mary says she heard him re-
mark that it was a pity the patient “ couldn’t
leave a little to the church at Waverley.” Such
are the realities of life. The wife gets her hair
tom out, and the priest wears his out so short that
no one can get a hold of it.

(Hardened Liver.
Five years ago I broke down with kidney and
liver complaint and rheumatism.
Since then I have been unable to be about at all.
My liver became hard like wood ; my limbs were
puffed up and filled with water.
All the best physicians agreed that nothing
could cure me. I resolved to try Hop Bitters ; I
have used seven bottles ; the hardness has all gone
from my liver, the swelling from my limbs, and it
has xvorked a miracle in my case ; otherwise I
would have been now in my grave.

of us nave seen a sick day since, and I want to say to all

fJJHIS ATHLETIC AGE.
The following expressions of athletic gratitude
are taken from a recent issue of the Manchester
Athletic News
Mr. E. F. Painter (of London Athletic Club and
Ramlagh Harriers), 55, Finshoro’ road, South
Kensington, writes I have been suffering from
a sprained tendon for the past three months and
have tried every remedy I could think of, but none
have done me any good. About a month ago I
was recommended by a fellow athlete to try St.
Jacobs oil, which I applied at once, and it did me
so much good that I shall in a few days commence
running again. Shall recommend it to all my fal-
low athletes as being the best remedy I have ever
tried.”
Mr. G. Smith (of Handsworth Friary Football
Club), 18, Carlyle-road, Handsworth, Birmingham
says : - “ Not long ago I received a severe sprain
in my ankle whilst on the football field, which
wholly disabled me from walking. The ankle was
much swoollen and very painful. Learning of the
virtue of St. Jacobs oil in such cases, I procured
a bottle and applied the contents regularly for one
week to the ankle, by which time the swelling and
pain had wholly disappeared, and I was able to
walk. I have also found the oil a most excellent
remedy for toothache and headache. I have,
therefore, no hesitation in recommendirg the oil
to football players, as well as all persons suffering
from pain.”
Mr. Thomas Charles Pullingcr, the well-known
bicycle rider, of 1(5, High-street, Lewisham, not
only knows how to ride a bicycle, but he knows
the right sort of a embrocation to use after hard
riding. He says, in referring to a strained leg :“ I
have found St. Jacobs oil has done my leg a power
of good. I shall continue to recommend your
valuable embrocation to my fellow cyclists, as I
consider it a rplendid article for rubbing down
with while training.” The Bicycling News,
April 23, 188 Y, also says : “ Mr. Pullingcr, of the
Catford, asks us to thank the gentleman vho re-
commended St. Jacobs oil to him.”
The fire brigade of the city of Birm’ngham has
reached an excellent state of efficiency. The men
are exposed to many dangers, and their arduous
work often brings about physical suffering. Chief-
Engineer John Bellhouse, and firemen Josiah Ben-
nett, Thomas Fidoe, Wm. Maese, Wm. Shaw, and
John Biittifi, write that they received great bene-
fit from the use of St. Jacobs oil in cases of severe
pains in the back and knees, also tender feet and
other ailments. The wives of several members of
the department also say that in their case a few
applications of the oil, cured tooth and face-ache.

PEES OF DOCTORS.
The fee of doctors is an item that very many persons are
interested in just at present. We believe the schedule for
visits is |3.00, which would tax a man comiaed to his bed for
a year, and in need of a daily visit, over $1,000 a year for
medical attendance alone! And one single bottle of Dr.
Soule’s American Hop Bitters taken in time would save the
$1,000 and all the year’s sickness. "Post.”

The Ohinesejin New South Wales have long since learnt,
thanks to a kind-hearted nobleman who employs many

“Don’t see me dying, do you?” “Ah, you are one
of the funny men I have heard about in this

“ How is the neighborhood in the way of health?”
“Finest you ever saw.” “No chills?” “Not
one. In early days there was just one case ; he
shook himself to death. He lies [two and a half

JT’S A LANG CRY TAE LOCH AWE
There are auld farran sayings in almost every
language, and in single sentences some of them
are found to be pregnant of remarkable humor
and vast philosophic force. But we may, with-
out jealousy, yield the palm to Scotland and
Ireland and to those rattling old counties in
England—Lancashire and Yorkshire to wit—for
the oddest, briefest, explanatory and most con-
vincing of all Scotland, has some choice ones,
and the gifted but glorious Burns-prince of poets
and king of fellows —did much towards retaining
for them a prominent position in the daily thoughts
of all Scotchmen.
That quaint old antiquarian, abided in mair
thicgs than auld siller (especially whame guid
whisky is aboot), declared there was more to be
learned of “Burns” in one hour than in London
society in an age.
And so with Scotch sayirgs. In them you can
learn and feel a lot. You will disarm your
opponent “wieawee wipe oot” bit o’ a yarnie
main nor wie a hale moontain o' argument,
FOR INSTANCE, if you want to explain that
something is DIFFICULT of ACHIEVEMENT,
what simpler than to remind your questioner or
hearer that “ It's a Lang Cry tae Loch Awe 1 ”
And, readers, please bear this in mind—that far
awa a cry as tae Loch Awe in the good old days
of kilted chiefs it had used tae be considered
(there were few Argyles wie their Lunnon ways
in them days), jet it fades into utter insignificance
when ompared with the cry that has gone forth
far and wide proc aiming, in trumpet tones, of

“Then, gintlemen,” said Dick to the iury, without

It was a bold stroke, bub the jury acquitted the

IS the Latest Novelty in the Photographic World. It is small, strong, very simple, handsomely got
up, and atrociously effective both on friends and on enemies. Six circular pictures, each about the
size of a crown piece, can be taken on one plate with most astonishing speed and perfect accuracy.
This Camera can be worn under a coat or dress, the lens projecting through a button-hole cannot be
observed and the simple action of pulling a cord hands down to either reverence or ridicule every
incident included within the scope of its vision. The “POTSHOT” Camera is not a toy, but a
really serviceable instrument of the class known as “ DETECTIVE ” Cameras. At the same time
an immense amount of fun can be got out of it, and photographs of people and things obtained with
ease which are practically impossible by any other method. A limited number only have been
imported by us, and they are well worth the attention of the general public.

The Referee
The champion, and only , Sydney referee,
Jack Thompson, officiated at Foley’s on Saturday
night, when the £5O middle-weight competition
was continued. Jack Fuller seemed non plussed
with the right-band-in front Nelson, and although
having a deal of weight in hand he allowed Nelson
to do all the fighting. Nelson has a poor idea of the
game, and Fuller won on points. In the second
round, Fuller was drawn against Burgess, and Mea-
dows v. M’Carthy. Fuller and Burgess faced the
music, the former for five rounds merely dodging
Burgess’ round-armera, which he did very cleverly,
rll^
MISS W. A.: “NOW, BULL, TAKE THIS AWFUL MOKE—I’M GOING TO WALK.”
and in the sixth he landed a couple of stingers on
Burgess with the left. The bout was awarded to
Burgess. Had Fuller stood up from the beginning
of the last round and fought Burgess, taking his
chance of a knock-out blow, his cleverness should
have kept him out of a deal of danger, and he
would have had a good show of winning on
points. Meadows, Burgess, and M’Carthy now
remain in the finals, which will be fought off on
Saturday night week.

W. G. George, the English runner, did
not find Australians quite such “ mugs ” as he
expected. He says the trip cost him a thousand,
and that the Australians are no sportsmen. We
saw George, fat as a porpoise, waddle home after
Myers on Sydney Association Ground. If this is
“ sport ” George is right. We are no sportsmen,

Yorkshire batting has knocked Lancashire

In continuation of our paragraph of last
week re the “ consultation” craze, it is significant
that at least two Civil Servants who are now
doing terms in gaol were possessed of half a
drawerful each of Tatt’s sweep tickets. We never
heard of any of “Barb’s” half-sov. tickets being
lighted upon, and yet the police bunted him
down straight away. As a matter of fact, the
present law has protected “ Tattersall” by hound-
ing down all other sweep-makers. “ Tattersall"
has now been prosecuted, not because there is
any suspicion of unfairness attaching to him, but
simply because the N. S. W. Government, instead
of boldly facing the gambling question as it has
been faced in other countries, choose to deal with
it in the spasmodic, illogical, temporising style in
which it deals with the “ social evil ” and the
Chinese fan-tan curse,

Turner and Ferris proved too much for
the British team in Sydney, Turner taking six
wickeds for 23 runs in the second innings, an
average which would have been improved upon if
the chan cesgiven off hisbowl nsrhad all been taken.
A feature of the match was the tidy and cricket-
like appearance of the Enerli-hmen compared with
the slovenly every-man-f< r-himself style of the
cornstalks. But let us not snarl. The neat shirt
maketh not the cricketer, after all.

Shrewsbury did not approve of the deci-
sion of leg before-wicket given against him in the
second innings, although his general play is with
his leg in front of the wicket.

Bonnor is found ! London Echo says :
“ It is stated that Mr. J. G. Bonnor, although he
will remain in England for at least another year,
will not identify himself actively with the Aus-
tralian team that will visit this country next
summer. Mr. H. J. H. Scott contemplatesjre-
turning to Australia shortly before Christmas.”

Mr, Peter Sullivan has at this very late
date come forward with the statement that he—
and not Joe Donnelly—was the builder of Beach’s
historical wager boat, the “ Jack Smith.” Don-
nelly, however, claims the credit of the work,
and openly alleges that he performed it at Beach’s
special request. Sullivan is no doubt a good
workman ; Donnelly is known to be a genius as a
boat-builder. He was the first who departed from
the pinched-up, narrow-tucked open boat, his first
creations in the broad-tucked boats, the 19 and 22-
foot skiffs for Mr. S. H. Hyam, known amongst
boating men as the “Flatiron” and the “Big
Skiff,” playing such havoc amongst their classes
that the style has been universally adopted amongst
the Sydney builders. Donnelly’s last effort in the
sailing line, a 22-footer for Mr. N. Johnson, looks
much as if she will beat the for-years-past crack,
the Rosetta, also built by Donnelly, and Beach
will row his race with Hanlan in a boat built by
“Joe” specially for the fresh waters of the
Nepean. If Sullivan was the builder of Beach’s
pet boat, the Jack Smith,” it is strange the cham-
pion did not give him an order on the present oc-
casion. Oarsmen in general would like to see this
qaes'ionof “authorship” between Messrs. Don-
nelly and Sullivan thoroughly cleared up.

There is no sweeter sight on this sin-be-
smirched universe than a good man labouring on
behalf of the griefsome widow and desolate
orphan. Which brief exordium may fitly preface
the statement that on the morning of the fateful
Cup a parson, in strictly orthodox garb, walked
into a byd c tobacconist's shou. “I am told,”
he said, “ i hat you have h re an ap aratm into
which people put money, and so n- times rec >ve
much m moy in return, Now, th> ra ss a po-t
wsdow in my parish who wants money sad y.
I think, therefore, that I will pot in a half-crown
for her, praying that it may return many half
crowns. I think that I will put it on Cranbrook
—White always runs straight. And I will also
place a half-crown in the name of Thunderbolt—
nothing like backing an outsider in these total!-
satora—for a poor orphan who Is sadly lacking in
this world’s goods.” And, clutching his tickets
ho shoved them deep down in his hymn book
pocket, and resumed the pious aspect which he
always wears in the sinful city. His good works
shall follow him, but when he heard that Cran-
brook and Thunderbolt had followed Dunlop and
some others past the winning-post, his anger was
akin to the fury of Etna, and his language was
that of the eloquent, but impatient and vehement,
bnllook-driver of the sun-seared regions of the Far
West.

Sergeant Corbett, who was dismissed from
the Victorian police force some months ago, in re a
little affaire d'amour, is now a full-blown book-
maker.

The sporting reporter of the godly Mel-
bourne Daily Telegraph was the only Victorian
tipster who placed Dunlop for the Cup. Hallelu-
jah ! Are you listening, Pastor Fitchett ?

The ancient taunt that a policeman can
never be found when wanted has been wiped out
at last. Policeman Jones was oa the spot with
his racing-lottery ticket the very moment George
Adams wanted to hand him over that £4500
cheque for the win of Dunlop.
• * *
Each of Shrewsbury’s previous teams was
twice beaten on the Sydney ground, while at Mel-
bourne they were never really extended. The
present team has been chawed up again on the
same ground in what appeared a perfectly natural
and easy manner. If this form were true—a fair
test of skill under the best possible conditions—
then it would be a mere farce to arrange matches
between N.S.W. and Victoria, for the English-
men can beat the latter till the cows come home.
So one is forced to conclude that the long-suffer-
ing Sydney ground is as unreliable as a bad billiard-
table, and though a “bowlers’ wicket" may be de-
Birable from a bowlers' point of view, there are the
elements of batting and fielding to be con-
sidered in a game of cricket. Only on
true wickets can the best batsmen show
their superiority, and only when the ball
is knocked around, can fielders affect the score
to any considerable extent. It is pretty evident
that Turner and Ferris, or even Giffen and Spof-
forth, can dispose of any English eleven on a
treacherous wicket in quicker time than any Eng-
lish professional could do the job. But they, in
turn, can always dispose of the Australians for a
fairly moderate total on true ground. We ven-
ture to think that the victors of last Saturday

Next Saturday night the crack wrestlers,
Cannon and Connor, meet at Foley's for tne big
money prize and cap offered by the enterprising
Larry, So far, the in-and out business has dis-
gusted the Sydneyites, and the sport has not taken
root. The stranglers have now a show of picking
up arrears, and a fair, manly bout may do wonders
in that direction. One more “hippodrome" and
the wrestlers’ occupation is gone for ten years in
N.S.W.

Balmain Regatta Committee of 1886 hold
some £2OO from their regatta, which they r. fused
to hand over to this year's committee, unless w
the written authority of every member of the ’
committee. “ A Subscriber ” writes to us asking
if this money is placed at fixed deposit in a bank,
or if, in the event of one of the committee having
gone to Timbuctoo—or elsewhere —the hon. trea-
surer will have the handling of this money until
the committee-man’s return. “Subscriber ” had
better “ ask us something easy.”

The English cricketers brought out by the
Melbourne C.C. have been requested to slog thei r
hardest with a view to pleasing the public. Play-
ing against Victoria last week, Stoddart and Pee 1
put on 100 runs in an hour, which was almost
more than the public appeared to wish for. On
an easy wicket the young amateur la all there
and the one-innings victory of the Englishmen
was a very, very sultry event for this great
country.

Only the other day a" learned Australian
judge laid down the’extraordinary dictum that
“ gullible dolts ” deserved to lose their money.
Why didn’t the confidence-trick men sent ,;o gaol
last week plead His Honor’s ruling ? Can it have
been because they weren’t lawyers ?

Juventas has thrown a foal to Oatcake.
This is Oatcake’s first-born, and it remains to be

alter the bushman'a renowned ——on-the-coala ?
