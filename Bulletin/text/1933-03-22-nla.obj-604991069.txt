Tended by Cork and Plain,
She flicked oIF a spider
That sat down beside her
And puffed at her Capstan again.
(i Times change,said the spider,
I once terrified her
When her dress was all billows and curves.
She used to look lyrical
But,oh/ how hysterical,
Cork and Plain must he good for her nerves!'

BOOKS
“Civilisation is Doomed”
The malaise from which the world has
been suffering since the war is having a
significant effect on its literature. Every
generation has had its philosophers of dis-
enchantment — Aristophanes, Voltaire.
Cervantes —but their satire was aimed
almost entirely at groups or tendencies.
None of them, with the possible exception
of Swift, who died mad, showed signs of
despairing of the entire human race. The
moderns have changed all that. The repre-
sentative books which are arriving at the
average newspaper office for review nowa-
days may be divided roughly into three
classes. The largest, comprising nearly 50
per cent, of the whole, co'nSists of novels
about England and America which depict
young or youngish people who have no
illusions about anything.. The characters
in some of the most amusing works of Hux-
ley, Aston, Gerhardi and the Waughs—to
name only a few —are totally without sen-
timent, as (say) Shakspeare understood it.
They cohabit casually and pass on. Not
only would these up-to-date Romeos and
Juliets scorn to die for love; they refuse
to take the thing seriously. They exult
in their freedom from the pains of parting
and jealousy. Yet there is anguish behind
their laughter. An appropriate conclusion
for any story of their lives would be: “And
they lived unhappily ever after.” The
authors in the second division are as sojemn
as the others are derisive. They begin by
postulating that things look appalling, and
go on to offer various Plans and Systems
by which our woes may be palliated. In
the past month between 20 and 30 of these
works, ranging from pamphlets to books of
as many as 400 pages, have been delivered
at ThE Bulletin office. N®ne of these Plans,
from the humble, not to say comic, Lang
affair to the grandiose Russian one, offers
anything new, or has been able to satisfy
considerable sections of intelligent people
anywhere that it has the slightest hope of
permanently curing a nation’s, much less
the world’s, troubles. And so we come to
the third section, which is composed of
sociological nihilists. These writers are
frankly unable to see a ray of light. Man
has destroyed his splendid heritage by his
own inherent wickedness and idiocy, and
his best course now is to get off the earth
as quickly, and comfortably as possible.
Civilisation is doomed. Here are two speci-
men novels which expound the last-named
creed.
Original Sin
Michael Arlen, author of Man’s Mortality
(Heinemann; 7s. 6d.), was one of the
pioneers, bofli as novelist and short-story
writer, of what may be called the promis-
cuity school of fiction. He may have been
cheaply cynical and slimily naughty at times
m the past, but he was never uninteresting;
in this book he is as righteous as a church
elder and as dull. He gives a highly tech-
nical account of the strides made by avia-
tion in the coming half-century. The
imperilled world has been taken in hand
for its own good by International Aircraft
and Airways (I.A. and A. for short).
Feaveryear’s Anti-gravitation Gyro made
it possible for the least experienced pilot to
land and hover and for ’planes to do with-
out wings. So the air was at last con-
quered. For nearly 50 years the directors
of IA..A. had imposed peace on the world.
True, they had abolished liberty, individual-
ism and nationalism, one result being that
vast hordes of unemployed wfcre drafted
for the good of the .others- to the waste-
lands of Australia, there to dig, drain and
build. Yet the world was happy on the
whole—or thought it was, which amounted
to the same thing—under this benevolent
dictatorship of technocrats. The inevitable
serpent enters the new Eden in the form
of Knox, inventor _q{ a steel-hardening pro-
cess Which makes units (or, as we would say,
’planes) indestructible, and of motive air
which gives them unlimited speed and
radius. Man turns out to be the same
instinctive wrongdoer that he was before
the arrival of the “pax aeronautica.” Knox’s
invention puts the I.A. and A. fleets in
the position of out-of-date warships.
We know now that this night of Sunday,
July 20, 1987, saw the end and the begin-
ning of yet another cycle in the economic,
evolution of man.... Europe seemed to
explode. A titanic maniac, as though long
crouched for a spring, leapt upwards to the
poisoned skies through the wretched con-
tinent’s thin crust of civilisation. National-
ism. Patriotism. Fatherland and Mother-
land. Love of country and hell on earth.
How thinly spread was that proud civilisa-
tion, as it had ever been!
The unleashing
of “the frenzied
idiocies of patriot-
ism for their last
and maddest
assault on the
sanity of mankind”
was followed by the First World State. But
Mr. Arlen palpably doesn’t believe it has
any expectation of life worth mentioning.
“Aren’t there, already,” he asks in the
capacity of a World Stater, “many amongst
us who are discontented with the ‘color-
lessness’ of modern life?”
Euthanasia
In Whb Goes 'Sailing? (Cassell; 7s. 6d.)
John Connell supplies the logical answer to
the question asked by the revolutionary in
embryo of Mr. Aden’s book. The action
begins in Sung-woo. Some passengers from
an. English ship get involved in an attack
on the town by Chinese revolutionaries, and
are left behind. Much to their relief they
are offered the hospitality of a yacht, the
Southern Star. The yacht stands out to sea,
bearing the four men, three Englishmen
and an Austrian, to an unknown destina-
tion. They are average Europeans with
nothing much to worry about, as an unem-
ployable understands the term, and nothing
at all to look forward to. Wolf, the Aus-
trian, has lost the only woman in the world
for him; she died of starvation in Vienna
after the war. Welbeck’s wife has left him.
“Call me a victim of the economic crisis,
if you- like. I don’t care. All I know is:
for the last 12 years I've Jived, and not
a moment of my life lia-s been worth”—-he
flicked his fingers in sad contempt— “that.
And now I’m a ‘foreign salesmaln’ of some-
one else’s rotten gloves. And once —well,
there was rather a good .shop called Wel-
beck’s.”
Graham belongs to a “Service family.”
It has been his life’s ambition to put* his
only son into the R.N., but he has had to
put him into an office. Alexander is an
old Oxford don who has got sick of his
futile job.
“There must be for every ordinary man
some single compelling purpose to whose ful-
filment he may devote whatever gifts he pos-
sesses, and without which these gifts are
useless.... Free pursuit of the one aim
makes any labor joyful, any amount of dis-
appointment of no account, any being hurt
or tiredness acceptable so long as it is borne
in the full and devoted service of the thing
that matters.”
Long bef@re these revelations are made the
reader has come to realise that there is a
purpose behind the voyage to the South
Seas on which they are being taken by
the mysterious owner of the yacht. Neither
his name nor any detail of his career is dis-
closed; he is a symbolical figure, a saviour
Who offers release from humanity’s discon-
tents. By the time the pack-ice is reached
all on board know his kindly purpose. The
four passengers dress carefully on the last
morning of their lives.
“It’s as well,” said Alexander, echoing
words he had not heard, “to finish up in
style.”
A mighty iceberg rises before them; the
order “full steam ahead” is given, and the
yacht crashes into it. This is a beautiful
book in spite of its bitter anarchism. It is
strong where “Man’s Mortality” is weak;
in its characterisation (how rgre to find a
fantasy without robots for human beings!)
and in its literary integrity. There are no
affectations, and no purple passages. The
stoiy is told in nobly simple language, and
the note of drama doesn’t begin to be clearly
heard till the end.

Almost Ours
I Frederic Manning, a brother of the present N. S.
Wales Attorney-General, was born in Sydney, but he
went to England when he was a young man and
he had lived there till his return to Australia last
month. He served in the war with a British infantry
regiment.]
We were discussing our prose-writers of
this century. Joseph Furphy was named,
and Dowell O’Reilly. Then someone said,
“There’s one we’d put in the front rank, if
we could really claim him. But we can’t
call Gordon an Australian writer and then
call a writer ours when he left us as early
as Gordon left England: a man who has
done all his writing abroad.” He took down
Frederic Manning’s “Scenes and Portraits”
in the 1909 edition. The first page of the
preface contained so effortless an allusion
to a Maori custom that you would say the
writer knew his Australasia. The rest of
the book, with high originality, moved
among general themes—Adam, Socrates, St.
Paul, St. Francis, Machiavelli—touched at
all times by the spirit of Epicurus and of
Renan. It was not surprising that Frederic
Manning recently edited a fine edition of
Charleton’s “Morals of Epicurus.” His
preface to this book is in the prose of

*“Jumbuk” provides the right protection against the
snares of Winter. Made of selected, long-staple pure

subjected to a special shrinking process that guaran-
tees non-shrinkability in each and every garment. The
soft down-like surface of the fabric is faultless, and
will not irritate the tenderest skin. The elastic texture
gives easily to every movement of the body; there
being neither “drawing” nor “pulling” to cause discom-

“Scenes and Portraits,” that of an eclectic
stylist. Like some intricate finials of old
oak, of which the hands of generations have
emphasised the roundness while never obliter-
ating the deeply-carved design, whether of
fruit of human head or small crouched
beast, Manning’s prose, the more you en-
counter it, reveals an inner tortuousness.
At the end of a page, the reader who naively
expected to face the north may find him-
self turned eastwards.
It was remarkable that the author of
“Scenes and Portraits,” with its maturity
of style and outlook, should produce a war
novel about 20 years later, especially when
he had brought out nothing in between,
except a rather technical biography and
some poems less characteristic than his
prose. “Her Privates We,” happening to
appear at a time when English readers were
looking for a war book, in English, to put
beside some that were appearing on the
Continent, was hailed as a vindicator. It
was not, however, written on any mere
impulse to catch the vogue, and it must
not be judged as the book of an hour.
It was an ambitious book, the author being
aware that the English soldier in France
and Flanders is no new thing (“the Devil
can quote Shakspeare to his purpose”), and
it is so composed as to keep the action
within a small group carefully displayed.
Significant humor, comradeship and courage
are all brought out by what at first seems
inconsequent.
The central character, a private called
Bourne, is a vehicle for the author’s appro-
priate musings, which run off sometimes to
the verge of consciousness, only to awaken
in the midst of most vivid actualities.
Bourne’s story is simply that because of his
obvious “education” he is invited to be-
come an officer, but hesitates, demurs, with-
holds himself. As you read, you know —
you would know even without the book’s
quietly dramatic title—that he will die a
private. On one occasion, after mentioning
in his stiffest and almost pedantic way that
“the wine has enlivened, without exciting
me..'. .to say it has gone to my head would
be incorrect,” Bourne is discussing the
nature of funk:—
At first it seems to push me right over. . . .but when
that has passed it only makes me think a damned
sight quicker than usual. When I went to see the
Padre to-night he asked me why I wanted to stay
with the company, and I shid I liked the men....
I like the life better when I’m with the men.
.Nearly, the same reason,, though not .quite,
as the one an Australian private gave -liim-
sel'f: for refusing all promotion when he
was decorated. “Blount had declined pro-
motion because he did not want it. The
life of a private soldier left him free,”
says Leonard Mann of an important and
almost symbolic character in “Flesh in
Armour.”
There is no explicitly Australian charac-
ter in the centre of Manning’s book —though
there is at least one in silhouette on
the skyline—but we wonder about Bourne
when we find him musing to himself
over his English mates: “They were auto-
matons, whose only conscious life was still
in England. He felt curiously isolated
even from them. He was not of their
county, he was not even of their
country, or their religion, and he was only
partially of their race.” Bourne is given
no race, no roots at all, no accent in his
voice. Not an Englishman: definitely not
Scottish, not recognisably Irish. We are
left to guess that he feels himself an out-
sider, an onlooker, a man of rebellious,
democratic habits—-and possibly an ex-
patriate Australian. At any rate, for all
his apparent introspection, he is less a
personality than a raisonneur, through
whose eyes the British private may be seen
both in action and between the strafes:—
“What’s it like?”
“Oh, ’e strafed a bit this afternoon, but it’s
cushy enough.”
A face of expressionless immobility, with hard,
inscrutable eyes and that even, monotonous whisper.
“Oh, it’s cushy enough.”
Since “Her Privates We,” in its many
editions, the only book to come from Fred-
eric Manning has been a new edition of
“Scenes and Portraits,” leaving out the
original preface in its rather maddening
attractiveness and adding another scene,
“Apologia Dei.” We cannot call him an
Australian -writer. Unlike his neutral
Bourne, he has, in a certain poem, declared
his dreams, which are set in the English
countryside and England’s past. “Fight for
your own dreams, you!” that poem con-
cludes. May we take this not only as a.
challenge but as an assurance of sympathy?
NETTIE PALMER.
Shaw in Search of God
In The Adventures of the Black Girl in
Her Search for God (Constable; 45.) G. B.
Shaw attacks both the religious indifferent-
ism cf the West and the active materialism
of Russia. Wells, if he dealt with the same
subject, would probably draw historical and
probably fallacious parallels between the
fashionable irreligion in the age of the
Antonines and the philosophic agnosticism
of the present age, and then erect a new
jerry-built Utopia on foundations below the
regulation cement content.
Shaw goes down to fundamentals. He
says, in effect, if Man’s purpose on earth
is not the quest for God, what other possible
significance has it? So he invents a black
giU who approaches a Bible given her by a
missionary, in an entirely unsophisticated
and realistic manner. She decides, what is
obvious, that the early Hebrew prophets
were engaged in finding God, and, accept-
ing their guidance, she plunges into the
jungle to look for Him. She discovers
that there are three separate and mutually
contradictory Jehovahs in the Old Testa-
ment. One revels in human sacrifice; another
jeers .at Job’s doubts and challenges him to
find a better explanation of the universe
than the one provided; the third has a
weakness for the new and fashionable Greek
philosophies. She encounters other spiritual
leaders, and from each she gains some
insight vital principle which makes
the: birds sing and the tigers prey on their
weaker brethren. Thus strengthened, she
meets Pavlov, sitting under a palm-tree. He
tells her that he has spent thirty years cut-
ting holes in the cheeks of dogs and measur-
ing their saliva when food was given them.
She says, what for? He replies, in order
to provide a scientific demonstration of the
truth of the conditioned reflex. Truth, he
says, is not truth until science has given
it a passport. She asks him what he is sit-
ting on. A log, he says.. She says, no, it
isn’t; it’s a crocodile. ' With an agility
astonishing in one of his age, Pavlov
promptly shins to the top pf the palm-tree,
whence he is unable to descend until
she tells him there' is a snake behind his
neck. He findfe himself on the ground in a
jiffy. Having given Pavlov a demonstra-
tion of conditioned reflexes without the
sacrifice‘ of a’single dog, the black girl
proceeds on her way, more mystified than
ever, and m£ets Voltaire in his garden.
Shaw himself is digging potatoes in the
backyard. Voltaire advises the black girl
to cultivate her own garden, and she fol-
lows his advice by marrying Shaw and
having half a dozen children.
By way of a change from the usual pre-
face, Shaw provides an epilogue in which
he traverses with- his customary brilliance
the ground already covered by his story.
He points out that the reason why humanity
is always in such a muddle about what it
believes and what it doesn’t believe is not
because it ever suffers from a lack of fresh
water, but because it always pours the fresh
water into the bath .on top of the dirty
water, instead of first getting rid of the
dirty water. The result is that mankind
is perpetually discovering what it thinks
are new truths but which are only lies which
were once truths and have since got some
new truth mixed with them. It is all right,
Shaw says, to preach the gospel of love to
African negroes but not in order to make
commercial profit out of them. His book
has -been indicted for Blasphemy. It' is
doubtful if Shaw was ever more serious and
reverential.
M.G.S.
And a Little Verse
THE THIEF.
Through a grey and sombre wood
Void of dancing leaf and flower, :
Grey and- lightless as my mood,
I have wandered'hour and hour.
Nowhere now I hear the song,-
Nowhere see the gleam and glow
That enthralled me, eye and ear,
Long ago, long ago.
Pleasures have been mine and pains
Since I quested here, a youth ;
Summer suns and winter rains
Many have I known, in truth.
. Can it be that high and low
Birds may still be carolling.
As unhearing them I go
Wandering wandering?
Since in gay and golden years
Here I strode with visions fine,
Days of mirth and days of tears
Many, many have been mine.
May it be with greenery
Still this woodland scene is fraught,
As with vision dimmed I stray
Heeding nought, seeing nought?
Strolling where of old I strolled.
Singing, dreaming dreams sublime,
Bobbed I seem of more than gold
By the thieving hands of Time.
Hard of hearing, dim of sight;
Songless, ligatless—bird and leaf:
Riflod, robbed by Time I seem—
Time the knave, Time the thief.

LAST OF THE LINE.
A basket of white kittens and a tray of
apricots,
A red wasp, buzzing, as-it hangs above the
honeyed fruits,
A dish of sun-parched orange pips, a lac-
quered box of dates,
And a beggar at the gateway with his bowl
of saffron roots.
The sun across the shadow bars the earth
with tiger stripes, .
There's a rusty/ gun beyond them, and a
loophole in the wall,
Once the arsenal of soldiers and to-day the
court of women.
And tile drifting dust of ages with its
perfume smothering all.
Dust of vanished roses, and dust of women’s
dreaming,
Dust of men who bartered, and of other
men who took—
Every stone is graven with the cipher of a
story,
The clatter of a weapon, or a lover’s
parting look.
Out beyond the courtyard is the yellow of
the desert,
And the yellow lion wanders there among
the mighty tombs.... *
With a basket of white kittens and a lacquer
box of sweetmeats,
The craven cub of lighting men yawns in
the women’s rooms. 111

S. AUS. TALKS SECESSION NOW.
Ik S. Australia a few days ago, at a meeting
of farmers, it was unanimously decided that
the State ought to secede from the Com-
monwealth, and, so far as was reported, in
the talk that led up to this resolution there
was not the faintest conception of what
the Federal compact really is anti why it
was reached, or of the difficulties which
stand in the way of accomplishing the dis-
ruption that is so lightly advocated. For
this latest outburst, no doubt, the very
stupid campaign which has been in progress
in Westralia, and which has sidetracked
that State in seeking redress of real griev-
ances, is chiefly responsible.
Both Westralia and S. Australia find them-
selves in difficulties. Of course they are
in difficulties. There is no country in the
world which has escaped them. The U.S.A.
has 12 millions of people unemployed.
Forty thousand farms in one State have
been taken over by the mortgagees. From
an agricultural town in the U.S.A. a creditor
wrote to an Australian debtor begging him
not to send the money that was falling
due —all the banks in his town, he said,
were closed, and if the money were sent
there would be no safe place to put it. That
is the United States of America, supposed
to be the most prosperous countiy in the
world. There is no land which is exempt
from the misfortunes that have overtaken
the world.
Our position, indeed, is infinitely better
than that of most. Take the case of Britain,
for example. It is very largely dependent
for its supplies of food and clothing upon
the sale of its manufactures abroad. But
the market for most of its manufactures
has dried up: either the former buyers can-
not buy or mountainous tariffs have been
raised in order to conserve to their own
people every possible penn’orth of their own
trade. We know how it is in our own
country; with all the desire in the world
to help Britain we have cut our imports to
the bone. In 1927-8 they reached altogether
147 millions; in 1931-2 they were down to
44 millions. Hundreds of British factories
are closed; hundreds more are working one
and two days a week. But look at Australian
figures. Our exports are almost entirely
made up of primary products; and, instead
of closing clown farms, we have worked
them at greater pressure than ever. We had
11 million acres under wheat in 1926-7; we
had 18 millions in 1930-1, just upon 15
millions in 1931-2, and we shall almost cer-
tainly have more next year. S. Australia,
a little group of whose farmers have been
so filled with grief that * they think they
must break away from the Commonwealth,
had 2,941,360 acres under wheat in 1927-8
and 3,960.000 in 1932-3. And the crop has
been astonishing, too: the production of
wheat has gone from 119 million bushels
in 1927-8 to 201 million bushels in 1932-3.
The figures for wool are of very much the
same character; though N. S. Wales and
S. Australia are carrying fewer sheep than
they did a few years ago, partly because
they have added so much to cultivation, the
total Australian wool clip moved up from
833 million pounds weight/ in 1926 to 998
million pounds last year, and it was all sold.
Do these wheatgrowers who have been able
to find a market for 201 million bushels of
wheat as against 119 million bushels in
1927 —do they realise that, whereas as far
back as 1913 the British average monthly
production of pig-iron was 855,000 tons, in
1932 it was only 297,800 tons, and that the
average at the end of the year got below
270,000 tons a month? Do they realise that
the exports of British iron and steel in 1913
averaged 414,100 tons per month, that in
1930 they were only 263,300 tons a month,
and in December, 1932, they were down to
163,900 tons?
Of course there has been a crash in values
of wheat and wool. But there has been a
crash in other prices as well. The
“Economist” index number's show that,
taking 1927 London average prices as the
basis (=100). commodity prices for March
were down to 59.9. The Melbourne whole-
sale price of agricultural products between
1927 and the end of 1932 fell 38 per cent.;
the full of the average price of things in
London during the same period was, as. we
have just seen, over 40 per cent. .It is
true that prices of rural products have fallen
farther than prices of non-rural products,
It is the experience everywhere. But the
thing we ought to realise, and' for which
Westralia and S. Australia ought to be pro-
foundly thankful, is that, whereas Britain
and other great exporting countries are not
able to find a market for more than half
their old output at any price at all. we have
been able positively to find a market for
a much larger quantity of our chief products
than we did even in the years of our greatest
prosperity.
These farmers of Westralia and S. Aus-
tralia are told and some of them
apparently believe that they would be
prosperous if they could withdraw from the
Commonwealth. “Secession,” the Westralian
“Dominion League” says, “will bring pros-
perity to our primary producers; our ports
will flourish and our factories will have great
opportunities; it will provide work for
everybody.” It is cruel to thus delude
honest men and women into believing that
they are suffering worse than most, and that
only the striking off of certain “shackles”
is necessary to win therri prosperity. Aswce
have seen, as members of this Common-
wealth they are in a position infinitely bet-
ter than that of most countries. The thing
they are suffering from chiefly is low prices
for what they have to sell and compara-
tively high prices for what they have to buy.
But Federation is not responsible for that.
America is suffering from it to a far greater
extent than any State of Australia is. It is
what the economists of Britain, too, call
“maladjustment.” The U.S. Department of
Agriculture* reporting at the end of the year,
said that “the ratio of the prices of what
the farmer produces to the prices of what
he buys, standing at 50 per cent, of the pre-
war average, was in December the lowest
of any month of the depression save June,
1932.” The average export price of Australian
wheat in 1926-7 was ss. 7d. To-day the
price is about 2s. 9iid.—a fall of exactly 50
per cent. Yet the cost of living in Britain,
according to the British Dept, of Labor,
has during that period fallen only 16 per
cent. That is the experience of the whole
world, and it is shameful that these makers
of trouble in Westralia and S. Australia
should tell these people that they can escape
the consequences of this world crisis by the
simple process of cutting the painter.
EMPTY LANDS AND AN ADDLED
HEAD.
“It is wrong that an unpopulated country
like North Australia should be barred to
Japanese emigration. It is not a white
man’s country. We cannot make use of it.
Many Australians agree with me”—all this
Lieut.-Commander Kenworthy, ex-Labor
M.P., said in England the other day. The
old gag has been cropping up consistently
for the last 40 years, and there are as many
fallacies in it as ticks in a tea-tree.
To begin with, North Australia is not
unpopulated. That part of it which has
been proved capable of occupation is being
steadily settled, and its development has
gone ahead as fast as that of the other un-
settled portions of the continent. There
is more unoccupied country on the Great
Australian Bight, facing the Southern
Pole, than there is on the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, facing, the Equator. Some of the
sparsely - populated parts are definitely
infertile, and, though there is plenty of
rain, it comes at the wrong time of the year
and washes useful constituents out of the
soil. Tropical colonisation isn’t a matter
of dumping people down or letting them
rush into a place like air into a vacuum.
It has to expand at the periphery, under
proper medical supervision, whether the
colonists are Europeans, or Asiatics. It is
true that when lives were cheap hot coun-
tries were stormed like the beach at Galli-
poli; but, as at Gallipoli, the casualties
were terrific. If that sort of thing were
resorted to to-day, there would be a world
outcry of humanitarians, as there was at
the Congo horrors.
Further, if it were definitely proved that
North Australia was not a white man’s
countiy, that wouldn’t help the lieut.-com-
mander’s argument. There is no evidence
whatever that the Japanese can colonise a
country that isn’t a white man’s country.
They haven’t succeeded in colonising even
such pre-eminently white-man countries as
Manchuria. All they have done is to domi-
nate it economically and politically, which
means that they have merely dumped on
it a few thousand bureaucrats, soldiers and
traders. The Jap worker and peasant will
not leave home even to populate their own
unpopulated island of Hokkaido, despite
every sort of official encouragement. There
is some evidence that the Chinaman can
occupy and multiply in tropical countries
as easily as in temperate ones. He pulls
rickshaws and works in factories in Singa-
pore as lustily as he does in Canton. If
the Jap had the same adaptability, there
would be Japanese rickshaw-pullers in Singa-
pore. Instead, there are 300,000 China-
men, mainly laborers, as against a few
hundred Japanese, who are traders, shop-
keepers or courtesans.
Even if all Kenworthy’s arguments in
favor of Japan were true there would be
no justification for picking on Australia
as if she were the only dog-in-the-manger.
The Dutch have immense areas in Insulinde
which are almost entirely unpopulated and
would be twice as fertile as North Aus-
tralia once, the jungle was cleared. The
French have similar huge areas in Cochin-
China. the Siamese in Siam and the Ameri-
cans dn the Philippines. Why doesn’t the
commander pick oil them? Probably be-
cause he has heard only of. North Aus-
tralia. and. knowing very little about it.
and that by hearsay, can’t resist thei temp-
tation 'of the professional politician to
exploit the ignorance of his audience with
. his little bit of knowledge.
There is possibly another reason. Some
people worship power. It is a sort of fear
reflex. When a country, is successfully
aggressive they fall down and adore it, as
they would a pushful plutocrat. Japan is
just now at her top. She is in process of
giving a cheap licking to a country of con-
genital pacifists who are politically dis-
organised and whose ammunition doesn’t
fit their rifles. Therefore it is at once pro-
posed, as it was in the cash of the German
up to 1914, that more should be given
them than they ask, before they come and
take it. As for the many Australians who
allegedly agree with the commander, at any
rate they don’t belong to his own political
persuasion. -The Australian ,trades unionist
may be an internationalist On Sunday, but
for the rest of the week he is, thank God!
a White Australian.
THE FARMER AND HIS PARASITES.
Once more the farmers in the House of
Reps, are complaining bitterly of the high
prices they have 1 to pay for their needs;
and they blame the Customs tariff for it,all.
In Melbourne a week or two ago there was a
grazier who had just sent to market a truck
of sheep and had got Is. Id. per head
after all charges were paid. He complained,
of course, yet he knew that others had
fared worse—had actually not got enough to
pay expenses. He had a couple of chops
for breakfast one morning and made it his
business to find out their retail price. He
was told chops cost 7d. per lb.—had cost
9d. until quite lately. This man’s sheep
probably averaged 401 b.: there were lambs
which should have gone 321 b., and sheep
r liich should have gone somewhere about
501 b. And there was the skin, with three
months’ wool on it. And the grower got
Is. Id. per head; and he paid 7d. per lb.
for" the meat lie ate in the city. The same
story could be told of most commodities.
And the tariff has not a single thing to do
with it,
For 40 years this paper has been cursing
the Australian tendency to crowd half the
population of each colony or State into
one obese city. This overcrowding is
largely responsible for the piling on of
charges between the. producer. arid the con-
sumer. It: means a vast waste in trucking
goods by train from the country to the
obese city; and it means a greater waste
in warehousing and distributing through the
metropolitan area, where for a multitude
of reasons freighting is preposterously ex-
pensive. The distribution, moreover, is
carried on in the most wasteful manner.
The papers are full of learned talk about
orderly marketing. At the moment there
are profound cables from London telling
us that if we agree to a quota, and cut
down our exports. 6 p.c. and do a few other
things, we may lift butter back to 100 s.
per cwt. But these splendid schemes are
always with regard to the export trade and
foreign marketing. Why don’t we face
the plain fact that our greatest national
loss—infinitely our greatest loss—is not
abroad but at home? Where is all that
money between what the Riverina grazier
got for his sheep and what he paid for his
chop? That is the money we ought to; set
out to recover.
The position at the moment is that be-
tween the producer and the consumer there
are such a multitude of mouths to feed—
probably six times more than the neces-
sities demand—that the producer gets far
less than he should, while the consumer
pays far more than he should; and because
the consumer pays far more than he should,
the cost of the producer’s supplies is vastly
higher than it ought to be. It is not
the working man—the wages man—who
is to blame for high costs. It is not
even the Trades Hall. For many years past
wages have been based on the cost of
living; and though Trades Halls have been
guilty of annoying interferences and occa-
sionally of fomenting strikes and oftener of
encouraging go-slow practices, the main
factor in producing a ridiculously high cost
of living and therefore a ridiculously high
wage-rate—ridiculously high compared with
the prices of wheat and wool—has been this
multitude of superfluous mouths interposed
between the producer and the consumer-
half a dozen men engaged in distribution
where one would be sufficient, half a dozen
vehicles, half a dozen shops.
The farmers’ representatives in Parlia-
ment can talk till their tongues are in rib-
bons and they will not improve matters a
fraction until they get down on to this
problem. Here and there high Protection
may have added a little to the farmers’
costs; but at least they have got counter-
balancing benefits—they have been saved
from that manipulation of prices by foreign
manufacturers from which they at one time
suffered so keenly. A nice position they
would have been in to-day if, for example,
they had been dependent on American agri-
cultural—especially . harvesting—machinery,
with the Australian £ worth about 11s. in
the.U.S.A.! From the overcrowding of the
army of distributors and middlemen, on
the other hand, they get; no. benefit what-
ever. y ; ' Vv:
WHO IS HITLER?
Who is Hitler? Who are the Nazis?
Who is Hitler? Adventurer, office-seeker,
mountebank? No! Honest, straightfor-
ward, clean-living man, fervent patriot,
great organiser, a man of vision? Yes!
He was born at Braunau 45 years ago,
the son of poor parents, his father a subal-
tern Austrian Customs officer on the
Austro-Bavarian frontier. Losing his
parents at the age of 15, he went to Vienna
without means. Having a talent for
drawing and a great interest in architec-
ture, he—long-sighted even in those days—
joined the building trade, first as a laborer,
later advanced to draftsman. In his spare
time he studied social and economic ques-
tions. His parents had inculcated in
him strong national German sentiments,
which made him immune against the
Marxist-Communist poison; in these years
of hardship and struggle in Vienna his char-
acter was formed.
In 1912 he migrated to Munich, and at
the outbreak of the war in 1914 joined a
Bavarian infantry regiment as volunteer.
First a private, he soon rose to be sergeant,
and was decorated with the Iron Cross for
valor. He experienced all the horrors of
war; he was both wounded and gassed, and
was blind for weeks; he was still in hos-
pital at the time of the November, 1918.
revolution. To a man of his fervid patriotic
feelings, this revolution was a cause of great
mental agony and deep humiliation. It
proved the turning-point in his life.
In 1919, at Munich, about a dozen people
founded a German Labor party. It was a
party without a political platform; all it
had were some confused ideas and a great
dissatisfaction with things generally. Hitler
joined up. Through close study and observa-
tion he had formed definite ideas on various
social and economic German and world
problems, and * these were adopted as the
aim and programme of the “National
Socialistic German Labor party.” To-day
we know its members as the Nazis. The
beginnings of the party were very small
indeed, but, Hitler being appointed propa-
gandist and organiser, his magnetic per-
sonality and rough oratory quickly gained
adherents. In 1923 80,000 people were listen-
ing to him on the Konigsplatz in Munich.
Up to this time the Nazi movement was
almost confined to Bavaria ; but Hitler was
joined by able and enthusiastic co-workers,
and the movement spread over what it is
still difficult for some of us not to speak of
as the .Empire. The high national ideals advo-
cated by the Nazis and the relentless fight
■waged against Communism attracted right-
thinking people. The ranks were joined by
recruits from all classes; even a son of the
former Emperor joined up.
In 1932 the Nazis, by then the strongest
political party in the Empire, claimed
leadership—and, incidentally, and rightly,
also the Chancellorship—for its leader, and
aimed at forming a united front with other
National parties against Communism. This
unity of front has just been achieved;
Hitler is Chancellor, and has been joined
by responsible men from the other National
parties. The discredited Socialist regime is
ended, the great cleaning up has begun.
And now for the airps of the Nazis.
First, they desire to obtain national free-
dom for the German people. Presupposition
is a firm and steady foreign policy, based
on a firm home policy, supported by a
people animated with the will to self-deter-
mination, thereby giving foreign nations
confidence in Germany as a partner.
Next, to build up the inner organisations
of the people on principles which will en-
able it to maintain its independence in a
competing world. To this end they design
to replace rule through the majority resolu-
tions of inexperts by a system of respon-
sible leadership backed by expert advice.
In the forefront of their aim's is the eradi-
cation of Communistic teachings and asso-
ciations.
Further, they desire to give the greatest
possible support to primary and secondary
industries, utilising all available means to
bring the unemployed back to work, there-
by creating purchasing power and renewing
demand in the home market. W ith this
will run a gradual relief from taxes, accom-
panied by a simplification of the taxation
system. They aim at reduction of interest
rates, both on home and foreign indebted-
ness, with stabilisation of prices as far as
possible. They put in the forefront of then-
policy the protection of primary indus-
tries, ~ principally agriculture, realising that
the latter, in producing the nation’s food
requirements, guarantees its independence.
Capital and labor being equally indispen-
sable in any industry or economic system,
neither is to profit at the expense of the
other Therefore disputes must be pre-
vented, and the gulfs that have been created
between classes must be bridged. Earnings
must be equitably apportioned. It is. con-
sidered that unity of thought and mutual
confidence, supplemented if necessary by a
regulating interference by the State, will
create the basis for sound economic pro-
gress. . ... ,
Such are some of the mam principles and
ideals of the Nazi policy. It is admitted
that no definite methods have been yet
evolved to cany some of them into effect.
Indeed, it is believed that for the moment
the aspiration is the most important thing
—the desire to produce these results. Re-
cognised authorities and experts will be
asked to collaborate with the Nazi-
National . Government to translate tlie
aspirations into practice through just and
equitable, laws.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Melbourne’s Hospital Crisis.
“Pawang” attends a meeting:—
The other day, in all innocence, I accepted
an invitation to attend the monthly meeting
of the Alfred (Melbourne) Hospital
Auxiliary. The Alfred is an immense block
of buildings off St. Kilda-road. The first
department I found myself in was the
Women’s Outpatients. There -seemed to be
hundreds of women and children sitting
about on benches waiting to be served.
Ambulances were arriving in queues. Nurses
and doctors sped along the long corridors,
which faded into blue distance between the
. wards. I made my way upstairs into a
committee-room full of women, with Robert
Knox, supported by a male secretary, in the
chair. Mr. Knox was just receiving the
reports of branches throughout the metro-
politan area. Mrs. So-and-so reported that
the Armadale branch had had a bridge drive
and collected 6s. 3d., and some ladies had
made jam, which had netted 11s. 6d., and
they were going to have a jumble sale to
provide the doctors with white coats. And
s 6 on through the alphabet from A to W.
Followed a record of the achievements in
jam-making and bottle-collecting of the
junior auxiliary, and then the matron, a
capable-looking person, got up and made her
report. It consisted of an inventory of
closely-typed pages of articles re-
ceived. I forget what the total value was,
but it didn’t seem to be much in relation to
the activities of the vast healing organisa-
tion.
To say that I was surprised is to put the
matter mildly. I knew that our great public
hospitals depend for the nucleus of their
funds on voluntary contributions. Don’t
we see in the papers almost every day that
such and such a hospital is urgently in
need of £50,000 and is going to launch a
campaign of button days, flower days, euchre
parties, etc., otherwise the building opera-
tions on the new X-ray clinic for cancer
must be suspended? But I hadn’t visual-
ised the working of the - machinery. It stag-
gered me to think that this was the way a
modern, self-respecting, not to say self-satis-
fied, community goes to work in its perennial
battle with disease in a scientific age.
Random reflections like the above don’t
amount to much by themselves, so I inquired
how my impression of haphazardness was
borne out by the facts. According to the
latest figures, the nine principal public hos-
pitals of Melbourne have an accumulated
deficit of £203,000. The Alfred’s quota is
£77,527. These figures relate only to main-
tenance ; and accommodation is steadily slip-
ping behind. The average number of
patients provided with beds at Melbourne
General daily last year was 382 and on one
occasion it rose to 417; the utmost accom-
modation officially provided for is 378. And
even with this overcrowding scores of people
who ought to be received have to be turned
away. The Outpatients’ Department deals
with Over twice as maily people as it was
designed to receive. If a big railway smash
or some other disaster such as an epidemic
smote the city, it seems obvious that the
system would break down.
.The situation in one respect at any rate
is not likely to improve. In fact, it is
certain to get worse. Even before the Depres-
sion more and more people were looking to
the public hospitals for treatment owing to
the s f ea dy growth of the feeling that, since
the State intrudes into almost every one of
our activities when we are well, it is up to
it to look after us when we are ill. Although
cjV last decade the population of the
State has increased by only 17 per cent., the
number of persons treated at the public hos-
pitals has doubled and the slump has made
things worse by forcing more people into
the class that cannot afford private fees.
Municipal a nd Government grants have more
than doubled and sterner raids on the private
citizen’s charitable sentiments have b'-might
an increase of 43 per cent, in gifts without
the leeway being made up.
Nobody has any objection to ladies finding
an outlet for their desire for social service
by. organising whist drives for Hie hospitals;
but. unless the Government tackles the prob-
lem from the bottom, serious trouble looms
ahead.
-
A New Crusade.
Sir Philip Gibbs, the English writer, pro-
poses in his latest book that the Prince of
Wales should appeal to the youth of Britain
and lead a new crusade. The idea runs on
the lines of one Lord Northcliffe was de-
veloping .at the time darkness came over
him. Gibbs proposes, as Northcliffe did,
new settlements overseas, with the addi-
tion, in Gibbs’s scheme, that the Prince of
ales should be their leader, go with them
and visit them from time to time.
. The Bulletin has said till it is tired that
there is no sound reason for unemployment
in'Australia. “Let’s re-employ 100,000 men,”
this paper has urged again and again; and
it has based that appeal on the unquestion-
able fact that the 100,000 would be their
own customers for all they could produce,
presuming that the production was properly
spread. If any number of men were put
on to a South Sea island, or on to a fertile
area of Australia, we know they would not
starve. They would proceed to grow their
own food, make their own clothing, build
their own homes. They would be limited
by little else than the nature of the
country and the means at their disposal to
buy seeds, stock and tools. With a mere
handful of appliances, and assuming that
they had enough food and shelter to carry
on with for three months, they could there-
after live in fulness and content. Gibbs’s
scheme, so far as one can judge it by skimpy
cables, amounts to no more than that—
with a few frills for attraction’s sake.
We moan about the dreadful state the
world is in, and all some of us can see
ahead is revolution and chaos and probably
the loss of what we call civilisation. So
far as Australia is concerned things are
m this so-called dreadful state very largely
because we are afraid to ask people to put
up with a little discomfort. And what
applies to Australia probably applies' to
other lands. After all, what would Philip
Gibbs’s new crusaders face ’ compared with
what the founders of, say, S. Australia
faced—-S. Australia is quoted because it
was set’up by a small English colonisation
society. The hundred or two people w r ho
came with Captain Hindmarsh and the few
hundreds who followed him had hardly any
money, and their livestock, implements and
seeds were, by modern standards, gro-
tesquely insignificant. They did hot even
know exactly where they were going to
settle. There had been no money to spy
out the land and make preliminary surveys.
And it was nothing very astonishing in the
way of country where they camped—the
Adelaide plains. Yet nobody starved.
They worked hard and they lived hard,
yet, so they declared, happily; and they
laid the foundations of what very soon was
a great, well-fed, comfortable, contented
settlement. True, they had no land to buy,
no rent to pay. But there is still plenty
of available territory quite ns good; and
the settlement of it would be child’s play
compared with the settlement of S. Aus-
tralia under the conditions of 97 years
ago<. And the settlement of a few hundred
thousand people in the older States of
Australia would offer no serious difficulty
if they really wanted to be settled and
the necessary leadership were forthcoming.

The Tung-nut Oil Industry.
From A. R. Penfold, Curator of the Tech-
nological Museum, Sydney:—•
Mr. Frank Cotton lias written a very
sweeping and dogmatic account based upon
a mixture of correct and incorrect data (B.
8/2/’33). Quite a number of readers have
communicated with me and expressed con-
cern at the opinions expressed and their pos-
sible adverse effect upon attempts to estab-
lish the industry. The position is a serious
one, for, whilst there is Certainly need for
some corrective to the undue optimism of
the numerous company promoters, there is
no ground for Mr. Cotton’s extreme
pessimism.
The Sydney Technological Museum has
greatly interested itself in. the experimental
cultivation of the tung-oil tree in Australia,
and, naturally, being a Government depart-
ment maintained by the taxpayers, it adopts
a very conservative attitude. In the first
place it has not recommended the establish-
ment; of large commercial plantations, but
has confined itself to small experimental
areas. It cannot be.too strongly stressed that
the cultivation of the tree in Australia is
still in the experimental stage, despite the
fact that the United States of America is
now planting large areas based upon experi-
mental work of 20 years’ standing. Evidence
is accumulating that the tree will thrive in
certain localities, present indications point-
ing to the east coast of Australia from Syd-
ney ndrthwards as being the most suitable.
It has also , been proved beyond doubt that
tiie quality of the oil from Australian-grown
trees is at 'least equal, if not superior, to
that obtained from China. Based upon these
results it has been computed that a minimum
yield will be from -Jgal. to fgal. of oil per
tree, calculating SO trees to the acre. This,
in my opinion, is an extremely conservative
estimate. There is still • much pioneering
work.to be accomplished, particularly on the
horticultural side, as, for example, the patch
budding of selected trees with a view to the
production of trees . giving high yields. of
fruit —ra most necessary desideratum.
We are well acquainted with the condi-
tions of the manufacture of the oil in China,
and consider that the improvement in the
quality of plantation oil and the use . of
modern plant will compensate for the low
cost of Chinese labor. Moreover, the Imperial
authorities have not only interested them-
selves in the project, but are taking a very
active part in the movement to have the oil
produced within the British Empire. The
United States’ requirements are 50 000 tons
per annum, the United Kingdom’s 4000 tons
and Australia’s 550 tons. If is desired
not only to produce the Australian require-
ments, but. to supply the United Kingdom
and supplement .the United States’ require-
ments.
We claim that the oil will be profitably
produced by a large number of people with
small holdings, guch as farmers and orchard-
ists, rather than by large corporations. Ex-
perienced citrus orchardists have informed
us that their occupation is a. full-time one,
the only respite being afforded by very wet
weather, which forces them indoors. The
cost of expensive fertilisers, spraying, etc..
and the low returns obtained for their fruit
are factors compelling many such persons to
seek other avenues of income. It is worth
noting, therefore, that the cultivation of the
tung-oil tree is more or less a half- or even.
part-time occupation, as the tree,. though
asking a certain amount of cultivation, does
not require spraying or any special attention.
Up to the present it does nut appear to be
subject to any severe insect or disease
attack. Moreover, cultivation of rotation
crops can be maintained between the rows
of trees. Our idea, therefore, of encourag-
ing farmers and orchardists to interest them-
selves in the experimental'cultivation of the
tung-oil tree will materially reduce the other-
wise high overhead charges, and it is anti-
cipated that- established oil mills will handle
the crop at comparatively low rates. There
is no reason, therefore, why the oil should
not be profitably produced.
If Australia is unable to successfully
hand'e the cultivation of the tung-oil tree,
then there is apparently nothing of any
value that it can successfully .cultivate with-
out the aid of tariffs, bounties and other
artificial safeguards.
The uses of the oil are rapidly extending
and. there is some doubt about the Chinese
being able to meet any increased demand
which might arise in the future. It has to bo
remembered that they are unable to cultivate
large areas of country such as can be done
in the United States and Australia, for the
greater portion of:their land is required for
the production of food crops. It is anru-
r.ent, therefore, from the information avail-
able, that the yield of 40 gallons per acre
mentioned by Mr. Cotton is a particularly
conservative one, and there is evidence that
even that yield will give a better return to
many of the orchardists of Australia than
they are able to obtain at the present time
for fruit.

Health and Good Government.
“In Australia we have a greater population purely
white living in the .tropics than any. other country
in the world can boast, and these white men and
women of the second and third generations live
there without any loss of mentality, physique or
fertility. It is the demonstration to the world that
the conquest Of climate is primarily'—essentially—
the conquest of disease.”
Thus at Canberra on March 1, in the de-
livery of the Anne Mackenzie Oration, Dr.
R. W. Cilento, Chief Quarantine Officer
for Queensland and the Northern Territory,
formerly Director of the Australian Insti-
tute of Tropical Medicine at Townsville,
late C.M.O. ' Mandated Territory of New
Guinea, one of the two Commissioners
appointed by the League of Nations to in-
vestigate health conditions in the South
Pacific Islands, M.O. for. six years in New
Guinea and Malaya, Gold Medallist of the
London School of Tropical Medicine, and
Australian of the': second generation. Few
Australians realise that a third of the Aus-
tralian continent lies in the tropics, that
every 'part of it except a fraction of south-
ernmost Victoria is nearer to the Equator
than any part of Europe, that several hun-
dred thousand Australians live and flourish
in'the Australian tropics, or that tropical
Australia has a much lower rate of infant
mortality than any State. Fewer still realise
that plague, cholera, smallpox, dysentery,
leprosy and malaria are not tropical dis-
eases at all. but have all raged at times in
Europe and have only been recently con-
trolled there. Their only habitat to-day
as regular features of life and death is
where social and sanitary conditions are
grossly defective.
It is regrettable, to think that the Lyons
Government performed on the Departments
of Health and Defence the only real major
operations in the “economy” line, cutting
both to the bone, and in the former case
terminating the work against the only real
menace to tropical development in Aus-
tralia, the hookworm measures. There is
obviously no popular vote-value in public
health, and very little revenue—not, at
least, such as can be visualised in terms of
“practical politics.” But, as Dr. Cilento
points out: —
We,. claim a tropical and semi-tropical
continent supremely free from disease; we
have the suzerainty in New Guinea of a
native dependency which can be to Australia
what the Dutch East Indies have been to
Holland ; we stand perhaps on tlie threshold
of events as revolutionary as those which
transferred the centre of world interest
from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic —
for events are every day more clearly
demonstrating the increasing importance in
world affairs of the Pacific.
Here is an ominously clear statement by a
leading authority. As the scattered Mela-
nesian peoples die out, their place is being
steadily taken by Asiatics: Asiatic politics
. and Asiatic diseases creep nearer to our
shores each year. He would be a bold man
who would venture, to prophesy the position
in the Austral-Pacific region five years hence,
If money cannot be spared for defence,
a very much smaller amount would suffice
to restore the Commonwealth Health De-
partment to the standard of efficiency which
it maintained, to Australia’s great if un-
realising benefit, before the axe fell where
there was least risk of union vote-reprisals.
Australia administers a vast tropical area,
and as the insistent though politically in-
discreet Cilento remarks grimly: “Unless
the Administration of tropical countries
makes health everything, it makes them
nothing.”

Education in Victoria.
From an old Victorian teacher whose judg-
ment The Bulletin respects:—
“Guide. philosopher and friend of
teachers,” Senior-Inspector Osborne’s de-
scription (Bt 22/2/’33 ), fits the majority
of inspectors: but what of the minority?
A much-discussed order recently issued in
the “Education Gazette.” that inspectors
must be invited to district school-functions
at which M’s.L.A. or other dignitaries are
expected to be present, surely indicates a
section apart from Mr. Osborne and his
worthy confreres, for a “guide and friend”
needs no crack of a departmental whip to
win an invitation. The far-back inspectorial
districts, with little schools in struggling
settlements, taught by young girls princi-
pally, doing formative, pioneering very
often under distressing conditions, constitute
the main problem. What is the remedy?
I suggest:—
(1) In selecting junior inspectors from the staffs
of High or Technical Schools or Training College,
less stress on . -high academic qualifications, and
greater on personality.
(2) Demand robust mental and physical health—
a nervy inspector is not a “guide” but a menace to
pupils and teachers, particularly in mallee or
mountainous districts.
(3) Tfie applicant’s record as an elementary teacher
to outw.eigh his later “higher” work.
(4) He should live in his district, not in Mel-
bourne. Bolting from the inspectorate at every
available opportunity is unfair to teachers standing
up to their jobs perpetually.
(5) Senior men to visit the “new” districts,
unannounced, periodically to ascertain how things
are progressing or retrogressing.
(6) Marking university-exam, papers to he banned.
Annual vacations'made coincident with the exam,
period are at times used for this remunerative work.
A fagged man is out of place in the bush.
(7) Ever-recurring changes of inspectors to be
avoided. One district, some years ago, had six
inspectors in ten years.
(8) Ninety per cent, of Victorian schools being
of the elementary type, the permanent head should
bq.a man with their interests primarily at heart.
The majority of the districts are manned
perfectly; but the jumping-off places for the
junior inspectors lyjed a watchful and sym-
pathetic consideration which they have failed
in instances to receive.

The Development of the North.
a man in the Far North:—
I see a Bourke to Birdum railway has
claimed a lot of press attention lately. I
wonder if we are to witness a vast expendi-
ture of money with little result, as was the
case with Vestey’s at Darwin. A far better
scheme for the development of the north
land could have been thought out. Three-
quarters of the proposed Bourke-Birdum
line would run through country with a low
and erratic rainfall, and where drought
is definitely king. The eastern and best
part of the territory it would serve is
already drained by the Queensland rail-
ways. It would be impossible to transport
cattle from the Territory to Sydney by this
line at under £5 a head, and that is an im-
possible proposition. The route is also
poor in mineralised country—that in a land
where mineralised country is abundant.
Why not this as an alternative proposi-
tion —a railway from opposite Yanderlin
Island, on the Gulf, where there is a good
site for a port, across to Wyndham, 650
miles? Such a railway would never get
out of the ISin. rainfall belt, and a fairly
beneficial and seasonal rainfall at that.
With this should be linked the Darwin-Pine
Creek railway, connecting it up with the
Stuart (Alice Springs) line, giving the com-
pany (I presume a co. will have to do it)
a railway system that could hardly fail.
The co.’s ground would run right to a port,
with a meatworks to drain the Gulf of its
cattle. Meatworks already exist at Wynd-
ham, on the other end of the railway, and
the building of the line would add to the
likelihood of Vestey’s reopening at Darwin.
A fair amount of the inland country would
come under sheep, providing a wool trade.
Then the country on the north-south sec-
tion from the present terminus to Stuart
has definite mineral possibilities.
It might cost eight or ten millions, but
it could easily be worth 100 millions to
Australia. And given a fair go it should
be an excellent proposition for any company
blessed with wise management.
*
Socialisation of Debts.
Angus O'Cohen has a plan, too:
Why should bloated capitalists possess
thousands of pounds’ worth of debts (much
of which we workers have helped them
create), while you and I have to be content
with a few lousy shillings on the slate at
the local grocery? Jack Lang notwithstand-
ing, it’s not the socialisation of credit we
want, but a more equitable distribution of
debts. Hence the O’Cohen Socialisation of
Debts Plan, which may be applied with equal
facility to private, national and international
affairs.
First of all, - private citizens would go to
the nearest bank and deposit a sworn state-
ment of their debts, with an estimate of
their deficit for the current year, and these
figures would be added to similar ones which
the Governments already provide. Thus the
Commonwealth Bank would compute the
debt-resources of Australia.
The next stage would be to arrive at the
National Debt Dividend by dividing the
country’s debt resources by its total popu-
lation. This would give the individual debt-
credit. Children would be included, because
it is b.etter that they should grow up with
the independent feeling of having a debt of
their own than try to make shift with the
cast-off debts of their parents, as is the case
now. For the year they were in force indi-
vidual debt-credits could be used to negotiate
any transaction which was beyond the imme-
diate financial resources of the person
concerned.
In international finance similar debt-
credits would be established, under the super-
vision of the League of Nations, from a
sinking fund created out of the various
national debt resources. Then if a couple of
nations wanted to go to war, each would be
given a debt-voucher by the League, and told
to go to it until the total was cut out.
It will be seen at once that the plan solves
the problem of frozen credits. Credits won’t
be worth freezing, even in the hottest
weather.
The First Sheaf.
“Tn old-world Germany the fanner put aside his
first sheaf for the rats and mice, that they might
leave the rest of the harvest alone.”
The damp sweet smell of the furrows, then
the reaping of the grain,
With the trumpet blasts of sunshine and the
piccolo of rain;
Shining stalks of green and flax
Gilt like coins and pearled like wax.
And the cutting of the first sheaf fine and
ripe.
The farmer mused upon it with his carven
pipe:
“Rats and mice, rats and mice, brown or
grey,
Come and take your fill this harvest day!
Remember, by your whiskers and your
pointed tails,
The first fruits of the harvest that has
robbed the flails
Is yours for lawful feasting, and when ’tis
gone
You must leave the farmer’s wheat stooks arid
his corn alone.”
What a fringe of whirling tails, of grinding
teeth!
Now a brown head on the top, grey head
beneath,
Spoil of many an orange eve and opal morn.
Lemon tint of wheat ears and the gold of
corn!
Dainty little lady-mice with small pink-
feet,
Whiskered rats with beady eyes, ran keen
and fleet.
Jostling, pushing, squeaking loud—
What a royal banquet! What a hungry
crowd!
Said the farmer’s wife, who stood apart and
the hubbub heard,
“When they again are hungry, will they
heed thy word?
In your reasoning, husband, there is just
one flaw
Only those with bellies full will keep the law.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
Priminister Lyons will go over, to the
West to join in the referendum campaign
and beg the people of the big State not to
allow a few soreheads to make asses of
them. The most humorous result of the
announcement that Federal Ministers would
fake a hand was an anguished scream of
protest. How dared these outsiders inter-
fere in a purely domestic matter like the
holding of a referendum? The gentleman
who protested against the captain ordering
him to remove half a hundredweight of high
explosives from his cabin had the same sort
of bee in his bonnet.
“Westralian secessionists have been greatly
heartened by news that a meeting of S. Australian
farmers has unanimously approved of the secession
of that State also.” —Wire from Perth.
WEST OSS: “Come on, South Oss. You put
the boot into her too.”
It is doubtful whether anybody knows or
will ever be able to find out what its ship-
ping venture cost the Commonwealth. At
June, 1923, the estimated loss was
£6,319,255, reduced to £2,645,761 by the pro-
fit made on working enemy vessels —which
of course didn’t have to be paid for. After
that the Shipping Board took things over,
and operations'for five years to June. ’2B,
showed a further loss of £2,506,783. Then
the outfit was sold to the White Star line
for £1.900,000, which was £2,537,000 less
than the book value of the undertaking as
at March, 1928. The purchasing co. has
now failed, and the Government has sold
what remains of the fleet for £500,000; there
will be owing to the Government £662,000,
which it isn’t likely to recover.
The Foregone Smith Government has
chosen a queer time to restore the suspended
industrial award for station-hands in
Queensland. Before March 1 wages were
from £1 to £2 per week with keep; to-day
they stand at £2 9s. There was scarcely a
squatter in the State making exes, at the
old rates; the new one will mean a few
more* men put off, and a few more properties
abandoned to the big banks and finance cos.
The nationalisation of banking is in for
another bad knock from Westralia, where
the same thing that shocked Victoria a
while ago has occurred —farmers over whose
wheat-crop the State Agricultural Bank had
a lien have, it is alleged, been selling to
third parties. In Victoria strong pressure
was put upon the Government to prevent
any action being taken; and the same thing
is happening now in the West.
The chief difference between most Liberal
and most Labor Governments these days is
that most Liberal Governments get as close
to Socialism as they can while most Labor
Governments keep as far away from it. as
they dare. When, therefore, an Anti-Sosli
Government acts up to its platform there is
liable to be a surprised yelp—as there was
the other day when the Vic.. Cabinet de-
cided that ' the Electricity Commission
must do no more retail trading after it has
got rid of its present stock of stoves and
lamps and things.
Tunnecliffe, Vic. Opposition leader, and
two other Labor M’S.L.A., Jewell, the Whip,
and Barry (Solly’s successor at Carlton),
have been fined a pound each for addressing
a meeting on current politics in a little-used
street at Brunswick. No circumstance was
disclosed that justified the prosecution. It
is true the defendants had been warned; but
as the street had been used for many years
for similar gatherings without question the
warning* meant nothing, since it wasn’t justi-
fied either. Recently Chief Sec. Macfarlan,
a former Attorney-General, said that a more
liberal reading of the law wouldn’t hurt any-
body, particularly when there was no
obstruction of a kind that caused inconveni-
ence; and as the Young Nats,, who include
Attorney-General Menzies, are keen on street
meetings “to educate the people,” it. looks
as if the “martyrdom” of Tunnecliffo and
co. may prove the seed of reform.
H. K. Watson, secretary of the new
Basher Gang in Westralia, says that a few
years ago he made an estimate which showed
that the State would gain £2,000,000 a year
by secession. The Bulletin knows lots of
other similar cases. It knows a man who
saved £5 a year for 10 years through not
insuring his house and furniture, and reck-
oned he had saved £5O until one day a mes-
senger turned up to tell him that bis pre-
mises had been burned down, and that his
wife and children were out in the street
waiting for somebody’s charity to rescue
them. If' you remind that man now how
he saved £5O you will probably go home with
a black eye.
The Federal Government sees enough day-
light ahead to let go a few more pounds to
tuggers who have war service homes which
they have outgrown or have not been able
to keep in repair. Since August, 1930, the
cow has been bone-dry; now, however, where
sewerage ought to be connected or jobs of
any other sort done, a few drops may be
squeezed out. If the Digger can do the work
himself, the materials will be provided. But
it has all to be kept on a business basis; if
a man can’t pay for what, he has got, he
can’t get more.
Josiah Francis, the ex-Digger who looks
after this fragment of the Federal Govern-
ment’s business, surprised The Bulletin
the other day by declaring that less than
4i} p.c. of instalments due on war service
homes are in arrears. Unless there is a catch
in them somewhere, they are figures that
ought to be written all over the world; for
not only are they a wonderful testimonial
to the Digger, but they show what an amaz-
ingly good position Australia is in compared
with most other countries of the world. And
they weren’t a few very carefully selected
Diggers either that got the benefit, of this
law. Altogether, just on 29 millions was
spent on about 42,000 applications.
The Trades Hall gentlemen who have just
started out to tell N. S. Wales that there
is no room for a Second Chamber in modern
politics ought to turn their attention to
Russia. The Union of Soviet Republics has
two Chambers, and “all legislation must be
adopted by both.”
Britain, having failed to persuade other
Powers to refrain from sending arms to the
Asiatic belligerents, has withdrawn its own
undertaking. Perhaps it doesn’t matter
much. In 1919 the Americans, hoping to
put a stop to the everlasting civil war in
China, proposed that all the Powers, Russia
and Germany excepted (they weren’t asked),
should restrain their subjects from sending
arms to that country. They all signed an
agreement, but it made little difference. Each
JOHN B. : “Oh, well, as it’s dead-certain the
cart’s going to be emptied, I suppose
I might as well cut in for my share.”
Government put its own interpretation on
the document; and in 1925 the British
F.O. stated that the continuance of dis-
order in the Flowery Kingdom was being
facilitated by the wholesale purchase from
minor European countries of the enormous
stock of munitions left over after the
1918 Armistice.
Queensland’s electoral rolls have long en-
joyed a reputation for elasticity. When the
Moore Government came to power it was
announced that they would be purged, but
recent revelations suggest that they remain
in the old carefree qondition. When checked
for the forthcoming local-authority elections
it was found that in one Darling Downs dis-
trict dozens of people whose names were still
on the roll had long left the district or were
dead. The prize specimen was that of a
man who had been dead 10 years, and whose
address was given as an hotel which had
been burned down 10 years before that and
never rebuilt.
MANAGER (to politician): “Go on! The
cricketers have gone. It’s your turn
again.”
Vie. Parliament, which now stands pro-
rogued until May 9, is not likely to resume
till June 28. A decade or so ago the Legisla-
ture get bushed. It was neither in session
nor in recess. Somebody forgot to continue
the prorogation. But somebody else found
a constitutional cobweb which served to link
everything up again.
There is still keen demand for land —at a
price. Doondi and Gulnarbar, on the Bal-
onne (Q.), opened for selection, had 818
applicants, calling for deposits of just under
£lOO,OOO. Applicants came from all parts- —■
a good many from N. S. Wales, where it
costs more to get on to 'a property but less
to work it and get the produce away.
Sydney’s Queen Victoria Markets, the
white elephant which last year cost £20,761
more than it earned, and which Lud Mayor
Ilagon wants to put a bomb under, have
been like that for the best part of half a
century. Yet the idea behind them (cer-
tainly all mucked up in the execution) was
good: somebody had a vague idea, that
growers and makers of things should come
into touch with customers. Instead, we
have built up in Sydney alone about 20,000
superfluous shops, and both parties, pro-
ducers and consumers, are plundered to keep
them going. Of course, the Q.V. buildings
are quite unsuited for the purpose; but the
idea is all right, and the sooner we get back
to it the better.
The other Latham’s Cocky party asserts
that Westralians are so shamefully plun-
dered by the Federal Oppressor that they
can’t stand it any longer. Yet its campaign
committee says they are “paying far less in
taxes than the people of the Eastern States,”
and gives the 1931-32 figures per head of
population to prove it:—
Total Ordinary Income
Taxation. Tax Onlv.
N. S. Wales £2 10 8 £1 G '7
Vic. 2 12 11 114
Queensland . . .. .. 3 2 11 1 13 9
South Aus. . . .. .. 4 3 10 2 6 11
W.A 282 1 1 3
Tas 2 13 4 1 12 3
The difference in Westralia’s favor is attri-
butable to the special grants from the
Oppressor. Those grants have been deliber-
ately applied to the reduction of the State
income tax. The equivalent in local taxes
would have to be raised if the secessionists
had their way, and another £lOO,OOO or so
would be needed to meet the annual losses on
the Westralian branch of the P."and T.
department—a bill which the Oppressor has
uncomplainingly footed for many years.
At the time of the catastrophe Lang
blamed Bavin for bursting the N. S. Wales
Government Savings Bank. Presently he
discovered that the culprits were the capital-
istic press, Robert Gibson and Seullin. He
now announces through his newspaper that
the bank “was closed by... .certain Vic-
torian financiers.” The gentleman has also
discovered that “not one depositor lost a
single halfpenny.” The truth is, as every-
one knows, that thousands of poor people
were obliged to sell their passbooks for as
little as 11s. in the pound.
“Na Vodre” (Fiji) : This country is
rapidly passing into the possession of Indians.
Of 63,837 introduced under the indenture
system (discontinued in 1916) only 24,665
elected to be repatriated, and there are now
75.000 of them in the group. Many are pros-
perous tenant farmers. Others have ousted
the small European trader and storekeeper;
even in the large European-owned firms edu-
cated Indians are gradually taking the place
of European stallmen. The Government
employs thousands as laborers, police and
clerks, some, in the clerical grades, getting
up to £450 a year. Motor transport is an
Indian monopoly; the same also applies to
tailoring, shoemaking, etc., Meanwhile the
native Fijian and Fiji-born Europeans are
wondering what will happen next.
This paper isn't going to guess what is
responsible for it, but taking all things into
account it gives a cheer for the slowing
down of births. In February, 1929, in Syd-
ney (metropolitan area) they were at the
rate of 18.51 per 1000 people p.a.; Feb-
-1930, the rate was down to 17.63; since
then, 16.72, 15.16, 14.14. And there is just
as much cause for satisfaction in the death
figures: they have fallen steadily from 9.21
per 1000 per annum in Feb., 1930, to 7.64
last' month. Infantile-mortality figures are
even better. This depression may be the
worst that ever was; but there was never
another that was half as healthy.
Tom Henley has just published a neat
booklet with the appalling title: “An Appeal
to Resurrect Industry and Save Our Youth
from Moral Debasement.” The author
preaches on his old text: “It is only by
allowing private enterprise to function that
the best results can be obtained.’’ The
booklet is “wholly set up and printed in Aus-
tralia by Alfred James Kent. 1.5.0., Gov-
ernment Printer, Sydney, N.S.W.”
When the cocky who is struggling to
make ends meet watches how some of these
main-road jobs arc done, he feels like
murder. Tiie Bulietin gets bitter words
about the Bruxner-road, up Ivyogle way
(N.S.W.). It is alleged to have cost £BB,OOO
for 10 miles, and expenditure on the same
scale still goes on. Nobody denies that a
road was wanted there, but the specifications,
arc alleged to be extravagant. And they
probably are; for there was a well-known
and notorious case where the board drove
its unnecessary and extravagant r'oad
through the length of an apple orchard,’ which
could quite easily have been avoided, and
paid compensation at the rate of pounds
a tree. '
“In tariff matters the policy of the Government
is to steer a course midway between extremes.”

BOTH CLAIMANTS FOR BRIDEGROOM:
“He’s mine, I tell you!”
Brisbane tramways, which were unloaded
on the City Council by a Government that
had paid a fancy price for them, are ex-
pected to show a small profit for 1932-33.
What will happen when the 44-hour week
comes back in July is another story. Any
attempt to meet increased costs with in-
creased fares is sure to be resented. One
heroic remedy suggested is the lowering of
fares.
It was said of a former Commonwealth
Public Service Arbitrator that he had never
been known to refuse an .application for
increase of wages. The present incumbent
hasn’t equalled that record, but the public-
service unions haven’t lost faith in him.
The clerks recently asked-him to make the
Canberra allowance £4O a year for married
men and £2O for bachelors. lie “refused the
application in its present form,” but sug-
gested to the Public Service Board that offi-
cers on low'salaries should receive “a special
allowance.” There is a special allowance
already, of £26 for the married and £l3 for
the single. The beneficiaries are also exempt
from State income and unemployed-relief
taxes, and for every pound they put into
their- superannuation fund the taxpayer puts
in another. If they think they are badly
treated there are at least a hundred thou-
sand unemployed fellow-citizens, among
them highly-qualified professional men, who
would be glad to change places with them
and dispense with the Canberra allowance.

“Quero”: Our up-country parson was
agreeably surprised to find that week-day
service (“Evensong and Carols”) just
before last. Christmas was crowded, week-
night services hot being unduly popular in
A CONTINUOUS SHOW.

a parish where two picture-shows offer rival
attractions. And even after the service the
crowd did not disperse, but hung round the
precincts of the church in a manner indi-
cating unusual interest and devotion. He
was struggling out of his cassock when a
small boy approached and said, “Please, sir,
mother says where is the card party.” The
bemused parson was trying to sort the
matter out when an agitated church official
rushed in to show him the church circular
giving the list of services for the week. The
notification for that evening read “Evensong
and Cards.”
“Mells”: A Sydney County Court Judge
lias done something to elucidate the law with
regard to the hitting of tennis balls on to
the private property of a neighbor. The
latter, according to 'Sonah, has no right to
retain or impound the balls aforesaid, how-
ever frequent their arrival and whatever
damage or nuisance they may cause; he
must hand them to their rightful possessors,
when required, and his only remedy for
injuries, sustained or alleged, lies in an
application for an injunction to restrain the
ball-smiters from further operations of the
nature complained of. In the case under
review no less than 24 balls had invaded
the appellant’s property, so that he may
have had some reason for feeling aggrieved,
and more when he was ordered to return
undamaged tennis balls, although he argued
that he was not responsible for the articles
having deteriorated by having been left out-
side in the rain. It may be good law, and
most people are ready to put up with this
sort of thing good-humoredly, but suppos-
ing a whizzing cricket ball came through a
citizen’s conservatory, would he be expected
to hand over the intrusive missile on demand
and content himself with instructing his
solicitor to enter an action for the cost of
the glass against some person or persons
who might be doubtfully identifiableV It's
a roundabout way of obtaining any satis-
faction, let alone redress.
“Spare Wren”; There is little need for
surprise at the news that St. Paul’s Cath-
edral in Melbourne is
already showing signs of
getting ont of plumb
through a sinking of the
foundations (B. 15/3/’33).
If people will rear immense
piles of heavy stone on
alluvial fiats close to a
river, they can expect no-
thing else. St. Baal's in
London has been suffering
from the same complaint
for years past. Other
famous English cathedrals
which have had to be re-
paired for the same rea-
sons are- /Winchester and
Lincoln. Curiously enough,
York Minster, one of the
biggest of them all, which
is built on the flat plain of
the Ouse beside the river,
has not given any trouble
in this respect. Fire and
not water has been its bane.
“Bert the Carpenter": It is really dead
easy to discover where anything has been
buried it' the area is a reasonably limited
one (B. 8/3/’33). When in London over
20 years ago a suburban grocer gave out
that his wife liad cleared out with a com-
mercial traveller, the police, with memories
of the Crippen case in their minds, came
along and, after thoroughly searching the
house, turned their attention to the back
garden. But they didn’t do any blind
digging. They simply flooded the ground with
water, and at once a subsidence of a sinister
size and shape was revealed. Then the
spades were used, with the result that they
unearthed exactly what the grocer told them
they would find —the carcase of a very dead
Airedale.
“Cine Ma”: A youth, aged 13, was so
fascinated by a Western film in Melbourne
that he. started to walk back-
wards out of the theatre
when the show was over,
still gazing at the screen.
He stumbled over a seat,
struck his head against the
floor and was admitted to
the General Hospital with a
fractured skull. This is to
knowledge the first abso-
lutely authenticated evidence
of harm being done to Aus-
tralian juveniles by this
class of picture.
“Cady”: As the occasional wearer of a
hard felt hat I have been interested in a
controversy in the London press as to the
origin of the terms “billycock” and “bowler.”
The most impressive authority states that
the headgear derives one of its names from
the famous Billy Coke, of Norfolk, immor-
talised in “Coke of Norfolk And His
Friends.” That celebrity wanted a lid that
would not blow olf with every breeze, as
the hats of his day were prone to do. ’ To
his aid came a hatter named William
Bowler, who designed the required article
and became a sort of involuntary godfather
to it in his turn. While on the subject,
does anyone know whence came- the Aus-
tralian synonym “hard-hitter”?

“Zounds”; The illustrious “Jacky” Fisher
is mentioned, with a certain regret, as
the last Lord of the Admiralty who never
hesitated to express himself in “straight-
flung words and few.” Still, the Navy
never had a monopoly of profane words;
probably there are plenty of Diggers who
recall military commanders that could
‘swear won’erful”—like Kipling’s Lieu-
tenant fjolightly, when he was arrested as
a deserting and disguised private. But. in
these piping times of peace there is pro-
bably less need and certainly less excuse for
pungent objurgations. It wasn’t always so.

go at reviews and manoeuvres and similar
peaceful pageants with a vehemence sug-
gestive of our army in Flanders a couple
of centuries ago. ITis profane outbursts
became something of a mild scandal at last,
and an even more exalted military func-
tionary was deputed to remonstrate with
him. The remonstrator himself, however,
was anything but mealy-mouthed and his
method of performing his mission was char-
acteristic. “Look here, Blank,” he admon-
ished the offender, “you’ll have to stop this
cursing and swearing on parade. Her
Majesty and .the Prince Consort have heard
about it, and” —here he paused to find some-
thing specially impressive—“the Queen says
shell be if she’s going to stand it:

“Lao-dah”: The cable editors of sundry
Australian dailies were confronted with a
problem of censorship the other day. A
message arrived from Tokio stations tiiat
the Licensed Brothel-keepers’ Association of
Japan had decided to dedicate one night’s
earnings to a fund for the purchase of aero-
planes for the troops at the Front. In
Nippon this item of news would involve no
moral or ethical question at all, but the
virtues of Clapbam are crimes in Martaban.
The cable didn't appear.
“Hamer”; An ingenious young man in
Sydney, finding himself with two shillings,
paid half of it in to open a Savings Bank
account, altered the entry to make it appear
as a credit of £llO Is., and produced the
pass-book as a guarantee of his financial
standing when he was negotiating for the
purchase of a motor-car. lie secured the car
on appro.—and both he and it have since been
vainly inquired after. A story is being told
of another hard-up who picked up an in-
come-tax assessment which some wealthy
taxpayer, possibly in a fit of annoyance, had
crumpled up and thrown down. Carefully
ironed-out. the document was used as a proof
that the hard-up was a man of substance
who merely happened to be short of cash;
and two taxi-drivers and a publican came
at the absurd bait. There are some smarties
even amongst non-professional crooks.

“Lyvad”: An unemployed youth in Bris-
bane managed to cadge a large fish from the
m;n-k' s, but had nowhere to cook it. He
waited until the small hours of the morning
and then journeyed to Anzac-square. Vault-
ing the guard rails, he tied it to an iron bar
and proceeded to grill it over the eternal
flame. A sympathetic policeman reversed his
beat so as not to see him!

“Jeames”; The elderly Indies who affect,
beach pyjamas are not Sydney's most con-
spicuous sartorial calamities. Most observers
award the badge of shame to wearers of
toppers and tail-coats. • Broadly, the only
male who can appear in a top-hat and appur-
tenances without looking a figure of fun is
one who has been accustomed to the habit
from boyhood, and has kept it up since.
There is no excuse for the absurd garments
in this country, yet every public function
produces a cloud of misguided old indivi-
duals got up in imitation of the London
dandies you see parading the enclosures at
Ascot on Gold Cup day. I took stock of
one after the late Archbishop Wright’s
funeral. A dingy silk hat, a couple of sizes
too small, was cocked on the back of his
head. . His ancient tail-coat, which was over-
long and billowy in the vicinity of the stern-
sheets, gave him a cockroach-like appearance,
which was accentuated by narrow trouser-
ings clinging at their terminals to rusty
black boots. Deplorable, however one re-
garded him, and particularly so from an
aesthetic standpoint. Young Sydney men
rarely offend in this manner except when
they get married. I fancy there must be
some old-clo’ shop that rents toppers and
the rest to bridegrooms for the fatal day.
All the lads I have seen married during the
last ten years have worn identically the
same get-up—-black topper, tail-coat" with
herringbone pattern, striped pants and
spats—and not one of these articles of cloth-
ing fitted the wearer anywhere. Of course,
they may not all have been the reach-me-
downs they looked, but. if not, it only bears
out my original contention, namely that a
man has to be born and bred, so to speak, to
the topper-wearing habit.
“Schnorrer’-’: The Shadchan or marriage*
broker would appear to be not. exclusively
a Yiddish institution. A Maltese girl sued
a compatriot the other day in Sydney for
defamation of character, the statement com-
plained of being that he had taken her to
a certain place described as a residential—
the meaning attached to that word being
apparently dependent on its environment.
The plaintiff claimed damages on the ground
that she had lost “several advantageous
offers of marriage” in consequence of the
innuendo conveyed. At this point the plain-
tiff's uncle stepped into the witness-box' and
explained that it was the practice among
Maltese for an intermediary to bring mar-
riageable eligibles together, and that had
been his role in the present instance.
But whereas “before the trouble commenced”
there had been several proposals for his
niece’s hand, only one had materialised since.
The jury awarded the plaintiff £25, which
doesn’t seem to be placing an unduly high
value on Maltese suitors.

“Iverys”: I left a library book in the
Mosman (Sydney) ferry, with my new
monthly ticket carelessly used as a place-
marker. Neither was at the lost property
office when I innuirod next day, but a week
later both came back with a pleasant
little note saying the writer had found the
book, become so engrossed in it that she
had to take it home to finish it, and
that she hoped 1 would forgive her
for the delay in returning it. The ticket
was still in the book, but the fact that I
had had to pay nine shillings for a new
one was an item that escaped the lady. It
would have cost me more if the library
people hadn’t advised me to wait before
buying a new copy of the book.

You say you did not. and as it is axiomatic
in Fitzroy that everybody would like to

out, deposit you in the gutter, remark

“Shellback”: The Kinsen Maru. which
foundered some 400 miles east of Mackay
(Q.) last week, had a few thrills in
a life of quick changes. Built in Eng-
land for a German firm, she was seized
in Sydney in 1914, and under a new
name tramped four oceans until she
bumped a derelict in the Channel in
1917. Patched up, she was tackled by a
German submarine, but escaped with little
or no injury. Then she did some more
tramping for the Commonwealth Line until
she was sold in 1923; after a long spell in
Sydney Harbor, to a Japanese owner, who
presently passed her on to another of his
countrymen. In her German days she was
known as the Tiberius, and under the Red
1 luster she became the Toromeo. In between
this and her last title she has had half a
dozen labels. A pity some of these old
tramps can't write their autobiographies.
“Emsworth”: Auckland (M.L.) lias
already anticipated Sydney Ferries in th"
matter of harbor speedboat services (B.
15/3/’33). A co. was formed months ago
to run water taxis —small, fast boats, seat-
ing up to half a dozen people. They re much
like the ordinary speedboat. \V hen I hired
one to run across from the city to ilevou-
port it cost me Is. 6d. for a few minutes
run, and was well worth it, but the water
taximan told me the co. wasn t receiving the
support it had expected.

“Whether one agrees with Mr. Scuflin’s every word

his rounded, polished periods and ringing tones
always give pleasure to the ear.”

He may be spilling sense or rot
It really doesn’t matter—
The gift of fluent gab he’s got,
The power of pleasing patter.
Some politicians roar and blare
Like ungreased axles creaking:
The coo of doves seems in the air
When Jimmy Scullin’s speaking.
It makes you think of crystal brooks
That, purl o’er pebbly reaches;
Of rippling waves that lap the nooks
Along secluded beaches;
Of bees that murmur at their task
Among the flow’ring wattle;
Of beer that gurgles from a cask
Or whisky from a bottle.
His message may be truth profound,
Or error, rank and odious,
But you may bet he’ll make it sound.
Whichever ’tis, melodious.
How glibly framed, how smoothly pat,
His briefest disquisitions !
A speaking ad. for Ballarat
And South-street competitions.
You’ll never hear him hem and halt
In dialectic mazes;
llis syllogisms you may fault.
But not his polished phrases.
Dull platitudes he clothes and cloaks
With craft there’s no lebuking ;
It almost hypnotises blokes
When Jimmy Scullin’s spruiking.
What though detractors dub his stock-
in-trade, with words uncivil,
As all too often poppycock
And none too seldom drivel;
What though the magic fades and frays
The more one sifts'and weighs it.
The sourest tongue that flicks and flays
May lavish* scorn on what he says,
But not on—how he says it.

“D.T.” (London) ; Luxurious liners cap-
able of flying from London to Batavia, 9000
miles, in seven days are being built for the
K.L.M., the Dutch air line. The cabins
will accommodate 32 passengers. The
machines wall be almost noiseless, it is pro-
mised, and will be equipped with lounge
chairs and navigating instruments which
should add greatly to safety w-hile flying in
bad weather. The present weekly schedule
is flown in 12 days. The new development
is portion of a general plan to speed up
all important routes. Thus Vienna, hither-
to two days’ air journey from London, will-
in future be reached in one day; and new
aircraft ordered by K.L.M. for the London
to Amsterdam service will take only 90min.

“Pawang”: Councillor Marshall, of Col-

an unemployed man had paid 3s. 9d. for a

doctor which turned out to be made of senna
and water. The councillor’s remedy w T as for
doctors to abolish the use of Latin in their
prescriptions so that patients could see
what they are getting. The professional atti-
tude is, of course, that it is not to the
advantage of patients to know what their
medicine contains. This, in my humble
lay opinion, is tommyrot. It _is a legacy
from the days when the healing art was
pine-tenths hocus-pocus and one-tenth science
of a sort. Nowadays the proportion is about
half and half. If a doctor depends for his
efficiency on a superstitious belief in the
magical quality of his potions he must be
in a pretty bad way scientifically. • The aver-
age citizen prescribes for himself on occa-
sions, and it isn’t supposed that w T hen he
takes an aspirin or a dose of salts the effi-
cacy of the treatment will be reduced be-
cause lie knows what the medicine is. Of
course, the real reason why chemists charge
exorbitant prices for bottles of the simpler
drugs is because they have to cover the cost
of their enormous overhead, due partly to
the necessity for stocking rarely-used and
complicated drugs, partly to their absurdly
small turnover, as a rule.

“Oxmoad”: Some American author put
forth a list not long ago of what he regarded
as the 12 most beautiful-sounding w’ords in
the English language. “Golden” was inevit-
ably one of them. Almost simultaneously I
read that the late Professor Saintsbury, no
mean judge, picked
out as the most mel-
lifluous sentence in
the language the
verse in Ecclesiastes
which begins “Or
ever the silver cord
be loosed or the
golden bowl be
broken.” “Golden”
has certainly com-'
to be recognised as
a word of great
charm, and most
poets have made
effective play with it.
but I can’t help won-
dering how much it
owes to its associa-
tions, and whether,
if the metal had ori-
ginally been called
(say) “zinc” by our
ru d e forefathers,
“zinc” and “zincken"
wouldn’t linger just
as pleasingly on the
ear. The same might
apply just as fairly
to words rendered
unpleasing by their
associations. In proof,
take the Story of the
old lady who opined
that the Creator
must have found a
deal of difficulty in
finding apposite
names for the differ-
ent animals. She made an exception in the
case of the pig; “anyone could have named
him.” But if the pig had been labelled
(say) “gazelle,” I suspect that word would
have just as unpleasing a sound.
“Der Jong” : The recent location in North
Queensland waters of a couple of Japanese
junks presumably on an illicit quest of
trochus shell 'has started the usual crop of
rumors. In Torres Strait there are wit-
nc.sses who will swear to having seen mys-
terious ’planes, and there is a circum-
stantial account of a submarine which
called at a lonely islet and, after watering,
took a diving departure. When the South
African war started, the Boers were victims
to the same sort of imaginitis. Someone
started a rumor, after Joubert had invaded
Natal, that the British were sending a fleet
of balloons to bomb Pretoria. Even the
authorities gave thj ridiculous yarn credence
—there was a captive balloon with Buller’s
forces —and all postmasters in the Free State
and Transvaal were instructed ,to notify
H.Q. of any appearance of balloons. Immedi-
ately from all quarters of the two republics
came pouring" in reports of balloons having
been see.n in the heavens, each apparently
moving in a different direction. Even old
Joubert couldn’t swallow, that, and the lid
went on the postmasters.

“M.L.C.”: The first religious service in,
Melbourne of which''any record exists Was*
held in the spring of 1835 at the corner of
Flinders and. King streets, where the Cus-
toms House now stands. Two or three sod
huts stood on the site then. The officiator
was Henry Reed, a local preacher of the
Wesleyan Church in Launceston, whose de-
scendants still reside in the Speck; and the
congregation consisted of Henry Batman
(brother to John), William Buckley and three
aborigines. A commemoration of the event

Two peers have enforced their rights in this
respect; though I forget what they were
hanged for, you may still find their names
if you look in the right place—the eighth
Lord Stourton and the fourth Earl Ferrers.
I don’t know whether any peers -ever
arrived in Australia for England’s good , in
the early days—at least one baronet did—
but some of the writers who have found
material for first-class fiction in those long-
ago executions might have made a good
point if they had depicted some claimant,
however remote, to a barony or a viscounty
objecting to being strung up with ordinary
hemp. It would have taken a long time to
obtain a silken halter in those days.

“D.” ; A tourist put it this way : “You Aus-
tralians are getting more and more disliked
abroad, and your tabloid rags are largely
to blame.. If a flier, say, arrives they all start
calling him by his .Christian name or nick-
name before he gets out of his ’bus. That
fulsome ‘Smithy’ business has done Kings-
ford Smith more harm even in Australia
than he may ever realise. Pataudi was
‘Pat’ and Allen w-as ‘Gubby’ to thousands
of tabloid addicts who, like the cricket-
writers, had never met them. In the older
societies, where people have their niches,
such familiarities are bitterly resented. The
average Englishman, on being hailed by his
school nickname by a strange journalist in
his Australian wanderings, is liable to return
a curt answer. Next day he’ll probably read
something on these lines: —
“Sniggs” Brown-Jones is a bad mixer, and is
disliked by his team-mates accordingly. Our Special
Representative has exclusive information of a violent
quarrel between “Sniggs” and “Billo” Johnson, the
left-hander from East Ham. “Billo” is" a democrat
who holds that a man’s a man for a’ that he isn’t
entitled by the conventions of an effete snobocracv
to wear an I Zingari tie. Get sense. “Sniggs,” or
our independent, democracy-loving Aussie cricket-
crowds will knock it into you.
The morons who take this kind of rubbish
seriously get a down on Brown-Jones, and
the next thing England hears is that the idol
of Notts or Sussex, or wherever it may be,
has been bombarded with bananas, if not
bottles. Ninety per cent, at least of the
existing ill-feeling between England and
Australia was stirred up on such lines
by tabloids and weeklies that cater frankly
for half-wits.”

“Pawang”: Discussing tfie California
’quake a writer asks “Why don’t they fore-
cast these disturbances?” It is to be hoped
that the scientists never do succeed in doing
so, since they will never be able to predict
their effects to any degree of accuracy. The
most celebrated historic earthquake was that
at Lisbon, Nov. 1, 1755. In the brief space
of eight minutes the whole city was reduced to
ruins and 50,000 inhabitants were swallowed
up. Thousands perished at Coimbra, Oporto,
Malaga, Fez in Morocco and even in the
Madeira; Islands. In 1857. 10,000 lives were
lost at Calabria, in Italy. In the 186 S
disaster 25,000 perished in Peru and Ecua-
dor. Then there was the titanic Krakatoa
eruption, when approximately 100,000 Javan-
ese were drowned by inundation in various
parts of the country. The great Jap earth-
quake of recent memory destroyed two
widely-separated cities and inundated towns
all along the coast. It is not difficult to
imagine what, would happen if the seismo-
logists announced one day that an earth-
quake would happen approximately on such
and such a date, more or less in a certain
area, and that it would probably be of a
certain intensity. Unspeakable terror would'
reign. Millions of panic-stricken people
would evacuate their homes. Others would
remain and devote themselves to loot,
murder and debauchery. Government would
probably disappear. And the earthquake l
would be quite likely to hit somewhere else
or not occur at all. I wouldn’t like to be
a seismologist under such circumstances.

“Ex-Goldfielder” ; It is curious to reflect,
in view of the present vociferousness of the
Secession League in Westralia. that just a
generation ago the cry of “Separation for
Federation” was even louder on the ‘gold-
fields. “Give us a chance of joining up with
the Commonwealth by submitting the bill
to the people or we’ll cut loose from you
and split.the colony in half to get what we
want” was the ultimatum of the Reform
League, which later became the Federal
League, to John Forrest and liis colleagues,
who were using every effort to block the
Federal movement; and with such vigor and
persistence was the agitation pursued, even
to the extent of sending a deputation to the
Colonial Office in London, that in the end
the blockers capitulated and the bill wan
sent to the people. The result staggered
even the obstructionists and the lukewarm ;
there was a majority of 25,109 in favor of
Federation out of a total vote of 64,491. I
cab still vividly remember the excitement
and the triumph as the polling figures came
through, and it was manifested not only in
Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie, the centres of
the agitation, but in scattered mining camps
all over the fields. Whatever may happen
next month it is pretty certain that the
goldfields, which swept Westralia into
Federation, w r ill be no party to “gesturing”
the State out of the union. But in 1900
close on two-fifths of the electors were on
the eastern side of where the rabbit-fen^. 1
runs to-day; things are very different now.

“Idle Imp”; The last “trial before peers”
prior to the Russell case (B. 15/3/’33) took
place in 1841, when the Earl of Cardigan
was tried for felony in wounding his man,
one Captain Tuckett, in a duel. The indict-
ment charged him with shooting with intent,
but there w T as some mistake about the other
fellow's name, and on this technicality the
accused was acquitted. Incidentally, Cardi-
gan, before his trial, executed a deed of gift,
assigning his estates to another nobleman.
It cost him £lO,OOO for fines on copyholds,
stamp duties, etc., but had he been convicted
all his estates would have been forfeit to
the Crown. It cost him another £lO,OOO
to have them re-conveyed.

“Whitehall”: It’s an odd fact that seem-
ingly intelligent people can be persuaded to
believe practically anything. A couple of
letters in a recent issue of the “S. M.
Herald” illustrated the point. One was
from Professor Woodhouse, of Sydney ’Var-
sity. He complained that a “Herald” cor-
respondent had written: “Two hundred of
the casts in the Nicholson Museum at the
University are the property of the National
Art Gallery, and are withheld from the
public.” Facts: Only 21 are on loan from
the Gallery, and they are available to the
general public. Charles M. Sandoz pointed
out in the same issue that a Sydney Bush
Walker had criticised the National Park
Trust for countenancing the erection of a
building at Jibbon, and for not evicting the
occupants of a number of camps. Facts:
(1) The erection at Jibbon is on private
property. (2) So are most of the 70 camps
referred to by the complainant. Of course,
these people believe in their misstatements,
just as the patriotic Britons who are now
saying that old gentlemen in members’
stands in Australia used to throw bottles
at Jardine’s team believe in the rumors they
are repeating. Spicy lies are hardly ever
checked. I have a theory that if Geneva
started a Debunking Department in which
all tbe tarradiddles told _ by nations,
churches, etc., about their rivals were an-
alysed end exposed by impartial experts, it
would .do more for world-peace than any
number of conferences,

Alec Peacock, Speaker since 1928, and
previously member of 14 Governments, in-
cluding three which lie led as Premier, will
complete 44 years’ continuous service as
member of the Vic. Legislative Assembly on
March 28. He is one of the five survivors
of the Federal Convention (1897-98) which
drafted the Commonwealth Constitution Act,
the other four being Symon (5.A.)., Isaacs,
now G.-G. (Vic.), Lewis (Tas.) and James
(W.A.). Still a keen Federalist. Peacock
seconded the motion which George Wise
caused the A.N.A. at Morningtoii (Vic.) to
pass deprecating the W.A. secession move,
and commended the A.N.A. board’s decision
to send a delegation to the AVest to advocate
a “No” vote at the referendum.
Pneumonia carried off in London last week
Leslie Urquhart, .the courageous, optimistic
driving force of the Mining Trust. In 58
years “L.U.,” as he was .known to his lieu-
tenants, had turned over much ground.
Driven out of Russia by the Soviet, lie was
looking for a new field for his ambitions
when Mt. Isa (locally wrongly discredited)
forced itself on to the skyline. Leslie
Urquhart wasted no time jn securing control
for his Russo-Asiatic organisation. Subse-
quently a sorting out of the Russian inter-
ests was found desirable, and Urquhart
formed the Mining Trust, which acquired
and financed properties in France and South
Africa, and also Mt. Isa in Australia. Sub-
sequently New Guinea Goldfields, Ltd., was
added to the list. To Leslie Urquliart’s in-
fluence can be credited the expenditure of
between three and' four million poiiijds of
real money in the, mining industry 'of. Aus-
tralia. At a time when London was looking
askance at base-metal proposals, he was in-
strumental in persuading the United States
stalwart, the American Smelting and Refin-
ing Co., to take a substantial interest in ML
Isa. That in itself was a good day’s work
for himself and for Australia.
Australia’s oldest married couple is
claimed by Forster (N.S.W.), the pair being
Air. and Airs. James Hadley, both Austra-

up a family of 19 children ; descendants of
the sixth generation were joined in the
recent celebration!
Premier JIMMY MITCHELL, leader of
the Secession party in W.A.
William Joshua Tilley Stops, LL.B., who
moves up to the .Chancellorship of Tas. Uni.,
vacated by knight Elliott Lewis, is the sixth
of the line, his five predecessors having cut
the 42 years of the institution’s history into
fairly equal periods of service. All save
clergyman George Clarke have been lawyers:
Lambert Dobson and John Dodds were Chief
Justices and Tetley Gant had been Leg.
Council President. The present Chancellor
is the first Tas. graduate to" climb to that
eminence; unlike his long-time legal partner,
present Chief Justice Nicholls, he has
avoided politics.
Monsignor King (“Tom” King to the Dig-
gers w r ith whom he served in Flanders) has
emerged from Lewisham (Syd.) Hospital
after a serious illness. He volunteered in 1914,
was appointed to the Bth Brigade in ’l5, and
finished up Senior R.C. Chaplain of the
A.I.F. He is probably the only padre who
confessed a Jew 7 during the war This par-
ticular Hebrew was lying mortally wounded
on the Somme. He wanted a minister of fii.s
own denomination, but none was available.
The position was explained to “Tom” King
by one of the dying boy’s cobbers, and he
went along to do what he c-ould. "Tell me
anything that may be worrying you, ’ he
said, “and I’ll treat you as one of my ow 7 n.
To the surprise of the bystanders the soldier
took the offer in the spirit in which it w 7 as
made, and was obviously comforted by tin*
padre’s ministrations.
There are six parties running for election
to Parliament in South Aus., and even that
counts the Liberal and Country lot as one.
Others are the Par-
liamentary Labor
party, the A.L.P.
the Langers, tlr
Communists an d
the Single Taxers
—with, of course,
a sprinkling of
Independents. E.
R. Dawe is the

A.L.P.-ers, the
Laborite s who
don’t approve
either of the Pre-
miers’ Plan or of
the Lang plan.
Dawe is only 30,
the youn g e st
leader of any of
the groups: he was

liament three years
ago as a member
for Sturt—t he r e
has been a Dawe’s

E. R. DAWE, leader
of the A.L.P. in
South Am.
Adelaide University’s W.E.A., studying
economics and commerce. He began to
take an interest in his fellow-man wdien
he was 22 or thereabouts, and not long
afterwards became secretary Of the S.A.
branch of the Society of Engineers.
A lucky man was the Westralian Laborite
who could fasten on to one of the newly
created goldfields seats in the early days;
as long as he stuck to his party he was*
likely to be there for keeps if his constitu-
ency could survive the periodical Redistribu-
tion Bills which-have been fatal to quite a
dozen. Michael Francis Troy was one of
the specially favored ones; he secured the
Labor nomination for Magnet 29 years ago.
and has found no difficulty in being returned
ever since, more often than not unopposed.
Michael was a very young man when he
became a professional legislator, a little
sehoolmasteriug in N. S. Wales and a few
odd jobs around Westralian batteries and
mines constituting most of his experience,
but he assimilated all the political economy
he could manage in his spare time and
developed into a fairly useful member. At
different times he has been Speaker and
Minister for Lands in Labor Governments;
as an ALL. A. he antedates his leader Collier
by over a year. Except W. D. Johnson in
the Assembly and J; M. Drew in the Council
there is no member of the party who was
in Parliament before Troy, and neither of
these has sat uninterruptedly.
“Pip”: The other day in Brisbane I had
a look at the picture “Northern Lights,” a
record of the British expedition to Green-
land to survey meteorological and topo-
graphical conditions with a view 7 to develop-
ing a new 7 air route from England to
America. By my side sat A. J. Cotton,
formerly of Brunette Downs (N.T.) and
Hidden Vale (Q.). Cotton had a particular
interest in the film, because his son Sidney,
an airman with a good war record; now 7
-living in England, took part in the rescue
of Courtauld, one of the party w r ho was cut
off on the ice cap and whose close call is
well known. Dropping his aviation, at any
rate for the time being, young Cotton is
now very busy with color photography in
its application to the cinema.
George Wise, ~ex-P.M.G., who w r ill be 80
on July 1, received felicitations from fellow-
delegates at the A.-N.A. conference at Alorn-

the directorate of the association for close
on half a century, and it is over 40 years
since he had a term as chief president.
Fritz Kreisler wrote from New York last
month to congratulate'Dan Carroll on Molly
de Gunst’s triumph in grand opera. Molly,
who was born in Bundaberg, was one of the
late “E.J.’s” finds, and she will shortly make
a tour of her native State. Kreisler was in
the depths of depression when he wrote. His
devoted wife has been seriously ill, and he
had to leave her at home when he went to
America. Except during his period of war
service it is the first time in 35 years that
they have been separated for any length of
time. Here is a sentence that will .startle
some of fhe Bright Young Things who
imagine that sentiment is anathema to mem-
bers of the intelligentsia : “I really feel lost.
It supports my belief that love is above all
else; eVen above the career of an artist or
of a mysician.”
Old Henry J. Moseley, the grand-dad of
the S. Australian Assembly, is one of the
few who are not asking for another term.
At 85 it seems a fair thing, especially as his
district w 7 as Flinders, one of the largest in
Australia and of all 8. Australian districts
the most difficult to get over. “Grand-dad”
belonged to one of the State’s pioneer
families, and himself has been squatting in
the Far North for over 50 years. He was
so busy that he was 62 before he got to
Parliament.
Sam del Charles Kaye, who died at Can-
berra recently, was born there in 1861 and
could tell all about the -first party of sur-
veyors who camped on what is now the
Federal capital. His dad landed in Australia
in 1832, and occupied the old Oaks Hotel,
the first pub erected in Queanbeyan. De-
ceased and his sons ran Springbank, a dairy
farm founded a century ago by John
MacPhefson.
An ex-legislator named Thomas Ryan, who
was in the S. Aus. Assembly in 3916, when
he was also returned, as a result of the con-
scription campaign, for Essendon (Vic.),
claims to be the only man to have had a
seat in two Parliaments at the same time.
Still, there was John Forrest. John was
a member of the House of Reps, at the time
of his death, and he was also a member of
the House of Lords, though he never took
his seat in the latter.
T. B. Molomby lias been given an exten-

April, when his present term expires, until
Dec. 31; W. W. Shannon, Clapp’s other
helpmate, who did not desire to be continued,
will go out next month. Shannon joined
the railways as a junior 52 years ago, and
was mechanical engineer when made a Com-
missioner 14 years ago. M. J. .Canny,
general superintendent, is spoken of as third
Commissioner unless the Cabinet adopts the
recommendation of the Royal Commission
of 1928 and gets a financial authority.
Revisiting her native land is Rosemary
Rees, novelist, actress, talkie player and
war-time worker in France and England. The
present travel story she is engaged to write
on Maoriland for Chapman Hall, publishers,
London, will be her tenth book. “A New
Zealand Holiday” will be her first volume
other than novels. She is the daughter of
a former member of Parliament, and a native
of Auckland.
Sydney Stubbs, who was Mayor of Perth
a trifle over 30 years ago, is one of the seven
members of the Westralian Assembly
returned unopposed. Stubbs was Speaker
during his last Parliamentary term and
made a pretty good job of it, the Perth
House having been of late years more orderly
than most. Stubbs was essentially a city
man until well into middle life, when he
abandoned urban pursuits for wheat-growing
and presently became a pillar of the Country
party.

man, w r ho was for years Resident Canon and
Sub-dean of St. John’s Cathedral, Brisbane,
and was inducted in 1898. He relinquished
his post through failing health in 1910, and
was succeeded by the present Archbishop of
Brisbane. Up to the time of his death the
ex-Bisliop was incumbent of a Sydney
parish. _ A better name for the diocese under
discussion, by the way, would be Papua,

Malcolm Reid, dead in Adelaide at 75, was
quick to .see, as long ago as the ’eighties,
what the Barrier and the Rand would do
for the timber business. He operated as a
timber merchant, and later as a wholesale
furnisher in Broken Hill, Adelaide and
Johannesburg, and founded the present busi-
ness of Malcolm Reid and Co. For years
he was an alderman of the Adelaide City
Council, and on one of his trips to England
he was made a freeman of the City of
London. H'e was a native of Port Adelaid •>.
Ex-M.P. Bayley, who will carry the
National-Country party banner in the forth
coming Wynnum (Q.) by-election, is still
in doubt as to who his opponent will be.
Forgan Smith was anxious that Brassington,
ex-M.L.A. for Balonnc, should have a go,
but Brassington does not want to do any-

than in the metropolitan constituencies.
N.-C.P. funds are low, but Labor is suffering
from the same complaint.
J. S. Solomon, who has just had a 80th
birthday and bowled in a match to celebrate
it. is probably Adelaide’s oldest native-born.
He can remember the city's first theatre
(which his father owned), oil-lamps in
hotels, water carted from the Torrens and
the making of Glenelg jetty; also the news
of the relief of Lucknow. He went with
McDouall Stuart on one expedition, and was
one of the escort to the Duke of Edinburgh.
Field-Marshal Sir William Birdwood,
Australia’s old friend of Gallipoli and
France, has been appointed Colonel of \he
Royal Horse Guards in succession to the
late Field-Marshal Robertson. “Birdie”
began his ..military life in tin 1 Royal Scots,
but early transferred to an Indian cavalry
regiment, and became definitely identified
with the Indian Army, between which
and the men who serve in the regular Eng-
lish regiments there is a sharp division. In-
cidentally, he is the first officer of the Indian
Army on record to hold rank in “The Tins,”
as the Service knows the Household Cavalry.
“P. Cornstalk”: The description of knight
John MacFarland, Chancellor of Melbourne
Uni., as a “sturdy Caledonian” is incorrect.
MacFarland was born in Tyrone; his
father and grandfather were also natives
of the O’Neill country. Incidentally, Me!b.
Uni. has a partiality for Irish Chancellors.
Its founder was Redmond Barry, from
County Cork, who ruled from 1855 to 1887.
John Madden, from County Clare, after
being Vice-Chancellor from 1880, was Chan-
cellor from 1907 until MacFarland took
charge in 1918. The other two Chancellors
were Bishop Moorhouse and Dr. Brownless,
both English, though Browmless held to the
faith of St. Patrick.

COLUMN
General Motors-Holdens
After providing for depreciation and other
contingencies, the loss for the last half of
1932 was £2722; it was £349,914 for the
preceding 12 months, and £516,474 for the
year before that, when General Motors
(Aust.) Pty. and Holdens, the efficient
motor-body builders of Adelaide, welded their
interests under the present title. Though
the old business had been highly prosperous,
slump hit the trade such a smashing blow
that it has been impossible to escape big
losses. The following figures, showing unit
sales in each section of the business, help
to explain why :—•

Sales for the December half of 1932 are not
available: but the value of chassis, etc., im-
ported into the .Commonwealth during that
period was £711,206 as against £144,146 for
the corresponding half of 1931. The pro-
babilities are that the car-selling section made
a profit, all of which and more, besides was
gobbled by the loss in connection with the
body-building department. Here the plant,
capable of turning out over 50,000 bodies'
a year, is planned on a mass-production
basis; the loss on idle plant for the year
to June 30 last was £30,474. However, with
turnover on the increase, and adequate pro-
vision said to have been made for possible
losses on the book value of stocks and
debtors’ balances, prospects of the prefs. get-
ting something on account of their arfears
(£lOl,OBB, equal to 3s. 6d. per share 'at
June 30 next) continue to brighten. There
are 561,600 of them, 6 p.c. cumulative—they
used to be the old Holden Co:’s ords. 0n
the market they fetch 12s. 6d. as against
10s. six months ago. Including the taxation
reserve (£42,342), the cover is 435. 4d. in
net tangibles.

For the last fifteen years or more toe City
Mutual claims to have paid larger bonuses
than any other life cilice in the world. It
is . With ’ astonishment, therefore, that policy-
holders learn of the board’s deliberations-as
to whether “the interests of policy-holders
would be best protected by passing bonuses
for the time being.” The director who took
this view considered that the declared
surplus of £460,000 (the amount by which
the life fund exceeded liabilities under poli-
cies at the end of 1931) should be used’ to
further strengthen the reserve for contin-
gencies, thus raising it to over £BOO,OOO.
The board decided, however, to adopt the
actuary’s recommendation; so £368,400 was
distributed in cash bonuses, leaving £lOO,OOO
or thereabouts (the actuary’s figures are
not sent out with the sheet) available for
the next distribution, or for whatever other
purpose the board may decide. The £368,400
of bonuses declared was equal to 52.6 p.c.
of the net premiums in 1931 as against 52
p.c. and 50.8 p.c. in 1930 and 1929 respec-
tively, and £328,208 of it remained in the
business as additional insurance.
The society's progress of recent years .has
been due largely to the bohuses it has paid,
and these have, been largely the result of
high interest returns, following a policy of
mortgage and property investments oh a
rising market. Moreover, such a policy has
been very helpful in securing new business
at moderate cost. But the cut in interest
on mortgages and Government securities,
growth of taxation, and the effect of
moratorium legislation, together with the
contraction of property values, have affected
the margins available for bonuses, as well
as the book value of some of the asset's—in
N. S. Wales the moratorium has rendered
some of the society’s mortgages nugatory,
for a-while at any rate. Hence the sugges-
tion ■to further, strengthen the reserve for
contingencies.
The assets are in this form:— ,
1931. p.e. 1932. p.c.
Govt, securities.. £1,103,493 16.5 £1,291,059? 18.3
. Mortgages .. 3,514,735 52.4 3,493,824 ' 49.5
Loans on policies 990,195 14.8 1,044,306 14.8
Properties >.. 559,967 8.4 655,477; 9.3
Shares and
debentures, etc. 364,249 5,4 377',897 5.3
Cash and sundries 166,901 2.5 197,503 2.8
At the end of 1920 the book value of, mort-
gages (£823,677) and freeholds (£258,099)
together ; was £1,081,776. At the close of
last accounts the two items aggregated
£4,149,301. Against that figure were free
reserves totalling £452,950 (= 10.9 p.c.), of
which £lOO,OOO- was for equalisation of
bonuses. These reserves are in addition to
the .life fund (£6,526,224)., the superannua-
tion fund (£20,012) and the £lOO,OOO carry-
over from. the 1931 surplus. The board is
now paying more attention to Australian
Consols, which, owing to. exemption from
certain taxes, show a better return than is
to be had from most mortgages these days.
In other, directions, too, the board intends to
invest more outside N. S. Wales in the
futurel
However, , subject to political develop-
ments, policy-holders need entertain few
fears apart from bonus prospects. With the
exception of an epidemic, the society is not
likely to be obliged to sell any of its assets;
and - whatever gap there may now be
between the book and market values of some
of; the assets can be expected to narrow, or
perhaps disappear, as conditions improve.
Of the three chief sources 'of profit—
interest, mortality and loading—the office
has in the past scored heaviest from interest.
It assumes that its life fund will turn in
3} p.c. After deducting income tax, etc.,
last year’s net interest- was no more than
3.27 p.c. on the mean fund as against 3.5,
5.8 and 5.9 p.c., for the three preceding
years. But well over £190,000 of postponed
payments was not taken into account;. an
extra £lOO,OOO of interest would have raised
last year’s net return to 4.8 p.c. Obviously
much depends upon the resumption of these
payments, and upon the use the co. is able
to make-of its properties.
The amount of new business put on .the
books during 1932 fell away £219,042; —
1911. 1931. 1932.

The slip of £12,920 in net premium income
was partly due to a change in the method of
presenting the accounts. Excluding bonuses,
exgs. took 16.5 p.c. of the year's .income as
against 15.7, 12.9, 14.5 and 13.4 p.c. back
to 1928. The spring is due partly to the
change just referred to.
Again, leaving bonuses out of the figuring
(they are included with 5 income and claims
respectively in the introductory table), the
improvement in the year’s actual income
(£988,683) was £6570. After paying all
legitimate claims and exes., £385,579 re-
mained, or £11,051 more than in the previ-
ous year—surrenders (£132,430) were
£32,998 lighter. The contingency reserve
(now £350,000) was strengthened by
£lOO,OOO, and £284,817 was added to the
life fund, raising it to £6,526,224.

Its extensively traded pound shares reached

touching 19s. on an oversold and very ner-
vous market in September, 1930; the
figure, which had. recovered to 295. a ye>r
ago, is now 365. 3d. The return at 365. 3d.

the two preceding years and 17£ p.c. for the
three years before that. Thus, Carlton re-
ceived £5453 less in divs. for the 12 months
of 1932; also rents, etc., were £3799 lighter.
Exes. (£11,283) were pulled back £6429)
leaving enough to show 8.7 p.c. on capital as
against 9, 12,5 and 15.9 p.c. for the three
preceding terms. On the basis of last

10,2 p.c. op its capital provided C.U.B.
lifted its div. to 12 p.c.

.fit was 11.4 pie. on its £1,950,000 of capital
as against 12.3, 17.- 21.6 and 22.8 p.c. back
to 1928. Certainly business generally lias
improved a trifle, but the trade is subject
to special taxation, early relief from which
need not be looked for. Increased beer con-
sumption will depend largely upon grovyth
of employment. Meanwhile, the co, has
seized the opportunity which the slump in
hotel values gave it to secure more of the
trade, and that should mean much when
better times come along.

’Half-year’s div.
After reaching their peak in 1924. earnings
fell away, due to competition and the aboli-
tion of piecework in 1928. But the system
was reintroduced, and, with the help of a
vigorous sales offensive, things began to look-
up again. Meanwhile, the co. had leant
heavily upon outsiders to finance the larger
trading. This and slump made trouble
inevitable, of course. Stocks and book
debts had to be worked down at the worst
possible moment in order to reduce the out-
side liabilities, while exchange and the tariff
—the co. imports a lot of its raw materials
—and the hand-to-mouth policy of retailers
added further to the difficulties. Thus a
loss of £11,334 in 1930 was followed by
another loss of £38,550 in ’3l.
Last year there was a marked recovery in
sales, thanks largely to the dual func-
tions of the tariff and exchange, and
prices were steadier and the debts pro-
blem became less perplexing. The spring
in gross earnings (£75,353) was £53,703.
despite low prices. Exes. (£64,509, includ-
ing something for bad debts) made off with
only £4369 of the increase, leaving enough
profit to cover a year’s, prof. divs. and show
2.5 p.c. on ord. capital. But the prof,
divs. had fallen 24 years in arrears; the
A’s were paid up "to date, leaving £11,250
still to come to the B’s when the books
closed. Excluding a reserve of £10,265 (up
£1537 during me year) against exchange on
goods , afloat, etc., there was then £26.487 of

The year’s better trading is further re-
flected in balance-sheet movements :

Thus to add £22,123 to debtors’ balances
and £25,480 to the stocks item, the board
tacked £21,617 on to the overdraft (£60,461)
and leant upon sundry creditors, etc.
(£55,516), for an extra £9lOO. The year’s
improvement in the more or less liquid
surplus (£69,450, including stocks) was
£17,844.
Subject to alterations in the tariff, the
outlook for the co. is better than it has been
for several years. But the market, doubt-
ful as to what may happen in connection
with the tariff, prices the A shares at 245.

An extraordinary combination of circum-
stances has enabled this solidiy-entrenciied
Maoriland exporter to put up excellent per-
formances during the last two depressing
years. In 1931, Smithfield (Eng.) prices
touched their lowest level (2|d. for mutton)
for over a quarter of a century; but the
co.’s consignments arrived when the market
was at its top. Most of last year’s mutton
shipments fetched from 34d. to 4-£d., killings
notched a new record and costs were further
reduced. Another factor is that the works
are at Invercargill, Mataura and Makarewa,
which means that, when supplies are plenti-
ful, the co. does not have to compete in the
overcrowded Canterbury markets, nor do
buyers there reckon it worth coming to this,
extreme southern end of the island.”
So the board was able to put last year’s
profit at 12.1 p.c. on capital as against 12.6,
1A 1 ° 12 H 11 2 n c. back to 1927. and
the div. was kept at 12. p.c. To pay 12 p.e.
- on uipuai ai -lie, snamnoiders funds (capi-
tal, and reserves combined) need net only a
shade under 5 p.c. During the fat years
of wai*-time contracts the board put by
more than it distributed, notwithstanding a
cash bonus of £22,761 sent out with £45 481.
of gift scrip in 1919. The unexplained
addition of £30,000 to reserves in 1931 came
from a “war contingency account.”
Finances are snug, as they always have
been: —

The more or less liquid surplus (£135.643)
was £15,207 lighter than at the previous
balance, due to the addition of £16.105. net
to the book value of the works.
The profs.—there are 20,160 of them—
enjoy priority as to capital and advance
with the ords. in any distribution beyond

scrip at 40s. as against 365. a year ago. The

basis.

This old-timer, which owned the Furracabad
Estate, near Glen limes, has in its latter
days been one of the Arthur Rickard group of
City and suburban land-speculating concerns,
most of which are now in liquidation. All
but ,a. dozen of the 100,000 ords. are held
by Arthur Rickard Extended (in liq.).
After a run of 6 p.c. divs. during the boom,
the slender reserves were tapped for
£16,795 to pay a special 23£ p.c. in 1927.
Then the public put up £25,000 in 81 p.c.
cum. prefs., now reduced to 6.58 p.c. under
the N. S, Wales Interest Reduction Act.
On top of slump came the class legisla-
tion of the Lang Government, which struck
specially at property-owners, thus demoralis-
ing the real-estate market and further de-
pressing values and rentals. Following the
change in Government, prices steadied a'
low levels, and property turnovers improve!,
mainly on account of the purchase of city
premises by firms previously paying rent;
there is practically no market, for building
land. So, on top of a trading loss of £5498
for the 12 months of 1932. the board
earmarked £43,348 to cover. estimated losses
on realisation of some of the assets. No pro-
vision has been made for possible losses on
claims aggregating £48,664 against three
other members of the group which are ip
liquidation. Thus, on the board’s figuring,
£45,000 of the capital (=9s.' per ord. share)
had evaporated at the end of last year.
The position :as balance-sheet figures show
it is as follows
1928. 1930. 1931. , 1932.

The year’s trading loss appears to have been
almost wholly in connection with mort-
gagors’ balances. The growth of £2264 in
unsold land was on account of repossessions.
The outside debt consists of a mortgage
(£29,396) and £4022 coming to . depositors,
etc. Of the liquidation claims £33,963 are
secured and £25,664 unsecured.
Excluding the realisation suspense
account, the hook value of the net tangible
cover for the prefs. was £3 4s. Impossible
to say when their slate is likely to _be
cleaned; there was £4IS4 in accrued divs.
coming to. them at the end of last year.

The new shark-proof swimming pool at. Manly
brought a few more people to “the village,
but this little concern reaped no benefit.
Moreover, it is hard to catch much that is
bright in the co.’s outlook. Shareholders
have averaged only 5 P-C. since the old
Clarendon was taken over in 1910. During
the boom there was a short burst of 10 p,c.
divs.; but other hotels sprang up, the Spit
(Middle. Harbor) bridge failed to bring
Manly the business that was anticipated, and
now slump has dimmed prospects.

last 12 months. Liabilities include £20,000
5| p.c. perpetual debentures, of which £12,000
was the purchase price of the Clarendon.
Much depends upon what the board has been
able to spend on repairs and maintenance
out of revenue.

They can secure his future
for a few pounds a year.
A double-barrelled policy that every father can afford for
his boy.
HOW wise is the father who arranges that his boy shall come into
a couple of hundred pounds when he is 21! How different would
be the outlook of thousands of lads to-day if they could put their
hands on a little capital with which to make a start “on their own”!
And how easy for a-father* to make such provision!
The A.M.P. has a special policy (Y) under which a father can endow
his boy in the sum of (say) £2OO, to be paid to the boy when he reaches
21, for a small annual premium. In the event of the death of the father
while the boy is alive and under 21 years of age, the premiums cease
immediately, and an annuity of £52 is paid to the boy until he is 21.
Should the boy die before attaining the age of 21, all premiums are
returned to the father. It is a fine
policy. Many a boy has blessed his
father for taking one out for his benefit.
This is but one of a hundred ways in
which A.M.P. assurance enables men
(and women) to make provision
for those they love and for their
own old age and peace of mind.
Wise men (and women) will dis-
cuss their particular problems
with an experienced officer of the
A.M.P. that they may learn how
easily Life Assurance can be
employed to solve them. Those
who prefer it will send for the
booklet here illustrated.

£2755. There was £3033 coming to out-
siders, £2OOO of it on mortgage.
In its first year the co. made a late start,
owing to delay in transfer of the properties.
Still, from 20 acres planted, five tons of leaf
was cured, an average of 5601 b. per acre.
Sales brought in £1197, and stocks at balanc-
ing date were valued at £3OO, making an
average of 2s. Bd. a pound. The loss on
the year’s operations was £1578, apart from
preliminary exes. The exact area cultivated
last year and the quantity of leaf cured are
not mentioned; but the weather interfered
with planting and the price dropped, leaving
the trading result £1177 on the wrong side.
That was after charging £133 to preliminary
exes.
As for the current season, 100 acres has
been prepared, and is said to be looking
well; and more kilns and a manager’s resi-
dence are to be erected. But a better price
will need to be realised and/or costs reduced
if profits instead of losses are to show up.
Of the remaining 205 acres the co. has sold
69 acres at an unstated figure since the close
of accounts. Though the Federal Government
arranged with the manufacturers to pay
growers an average of 2s. 3d. a pound for
last season’s crop, it is impossible to say
what the leaf will fetch in the future.
According to the Tariff Board, production,
which is expanding rapidly, especially in
North Queensland, is expected to overtake
manufacturers’ requirements of local leaf
within a couple of years.
The Electrolytic Zinc Co.’s output for
1932 was 53,200 tons of zinc, valued at
£948,396, and 158 tons of cadmium, worth
£22,164; in 1931 53,832 tons of zinc and 198
tons of cadmium were produced. The small
reduction was due to the International Zinc
Cartel’s restriction. The co. now markets
about one-third of its zinc as Derwent brand
spelter, in which a small amount of lead is
added to the electrolytic zinc during casting.
The new plant, now almost complete, willnot
be placed in commission until metal prices
improve; it has a capacity of 18,000 tons of
zinc per annum. The co. is employing about
720 hands, or 200 less than in the boom
years.

Recent developments have sent Wailii’s

lode, the new west reef has been driven on
for 127 ft. in ore assaying up to 755. 6d. per
ton (gold 845.) ; widths range from 2ft.
to Oft. Crosscuts are to be driven to this
reef from Nos. 2, 4 and 5 levels. On the
Royal lode, a winze from the No. 11 level
has shown ore worth 645. 3d. per ton, while
a drive from the same level on the Empire
lode has been in stone assaying 48s. 9d. for
77ft., the width being 3ft. 6in. Ore reserves
at the end of 1931 were figured at 342,870
tons, assaying 335. 3d., Waihi; 23,120 tons,

Amalgamated Ivawarau is. waiting for a
license from the Maoriland Minister of Mines
to erect a new dam across the Kawarau
River, half a mile below its junction with
the Arrow. The idea is to hold back the
Shotover and Arrow waters, and lay bare
the bed of the Kawarau, which is believed
to contain a lot of gold. It is hoped that
the work will be completed by the middle of
1934; the cost is put at about £lOO.OOO. The
previous dam, erected in 1926 at Frankton
Falls, failed to do what was expected of it.

Siiaya Tin’s option at Lolworth (N.Q.),
which runs out in April, has been renewed
till July 4. The shaft, now down 110 ft., has
been timbered and equipped. At 100 ft. the
east drive has opened up an Bin. vein, carry-
ing high gold values. In the west drive 19in.
of heavily-mineralised quartz carries only
low values. Interest now centres in
the south crosscut, which is to be driven
across the lode to the hanging wall, thought
to be about 80ft. away. This should dis-
close whatever veins, leaders, etc., the for-
mation contains at this depth.

mora field, near Gladstone (Q.), got Over
290 z. of gold from 4 tons of stone, and 100
tons or more of high-grade stuff is in sight.
At the old No. 1 West Archer an Sin. reef,
carrying good colors, has been struck,
and other finds are reported in the neighbor-
liood, where pegging is in progress. The
Targinnie Scottish, which carries a lot of
now payable ore, is also being worked. A
syndicate has cyanided 350 tons of oxidised
slimes from the old public battery for 330 z.
of gold and soz. of silver. A Mines Depart-
ment portable batterv should be sent to the
field.

A Southern syndicate is testing the allu-
vial at Four-mile Creek, on the old Cania
field, Gladstone (Q.). Reef mining is also
in progress on various parts of the field.
The most oromising show is the Victoria (a
profitably producer in the early days), where
a new lode has been located. A recent trial
crushing of Bcwt. averaged soz. of gold per
ton. At the Mount Hope and Day Dawn
assays have shown over 14oz. to the’ ton.

New Development Prospecting, a Brisbane
co., has taken over the Ironclad on the Wool-
gar goldfield, 82 miles from Richmond (Q.).
The Commonwealth Mines Syndicate holds
some 10.000 acres on the northern end of
the field, where extensive prospecting is
about to begin. Many small claims have
been pegged.

Last year 200 tons of tin oxide was
obtained from the Mt. Go-net district (Q.).
Oakey Creek crushed 3000 tons from the
Excelsior and Excellent in its ten-head bat-
tery for 58 tons of t.o. The Gilmore, worked
by tributors, produced 40 tons of t.o. from
low-grade ores, and Nettle’s Creek Sluicing
obtained good yields until held up by water
shortage.

The Carpathia, the last and hardiest of the
offspring of the Ardletlian (N.S.W.) tin
boom, still has a flicker of life in it. Last
half-year’s revenue from tin-sales and share
of tributors’ earnings was £1592, but it.
jvasn’t enough to cover outgoings by £204.
The co. still has a few hundreds in hand.

Siamese Tin Syndicate, which has ex-
tensive alluvial tin areas at St. Helens
(Tad.)', lias completed the 24-mile water race
from St. Golumba Falls to its George River
area, where sluicing will begin early in
July. The wash, 6ft. thick: is expected to
average about lib. of tin oxide per c.y. On
the Argonaut property, bought early in 1982
from Pioneer Tin, the sluicing of 0.851 b.
ground is said to be yielding satisfactory
results. The co. also has alluvial flats at
Goshen in the same district. There is
£200,000 of capital waiting to be fed.

During 1932 triDutors tu Mount Biselioff,
Waratah (Tas.), mined 8107 tons of tin
ore, which yielded 395 tons of 67. S p.c. con-
centrate ; they also treated 35,767 c.y. of
old mill tailings for 61 tons of 65 p.c. con-
centrate. Thus 456 tons of concentrates was
produced as against 279 tons in 1931. Royal-
ties paid by 48 tributing parties brought in
£12,217, giving a profit to the co. of £1896
compared with losses of £33 in 1931 and
£6164 in 1930. The extension of the pyrrho-
tite orebody underlying the gossan face has
put more heart into tributors.
* * * *
Though mining lias ceased at the North
Mount Farrell (Tas.), the residues and some
of tlie ore at grass are being put through the
flotation plant, which is capable of handling
1000 tons weekly. But unless the price of
lead soon improves, this work is likely to
cease, too. A scheme for intensively pros-
pecting a number of promising outcrops
in the district is being considered by the
Government.

A flotation plant is being installed at Ben-
digo to recover the fine gold in the cemented
deep-lead gravels in the vicinity of Iron-
stone Hill. This gold cannot be satisfactorily
collected on the usual riffles; but fine free
gold can now be readily floated.

Lauraville Gold is pushing ahead with the
development of its mine at Gaffney’s Creek
(Vic.), where 8000 tons of stone assaying

ing is being taken out. >

’Guildford Plateau Gold, Guildford (Vic.),

Wavic Gold Development has been
launched in Melbourne with a nominal capi-
tal of £20,000 to take an option over the
Sons of Freedom, an old mine 20 miles from
Bairnsdale, and four shows in Westralia —
the New Brilliant, Surprise and Two Boys
at Higginsville, and the Gladstone, near
Niagara. The Two Boys _ and Gladstone
appear to be the most promising. The Two
Boys is a new concern from which prospec-
tors have taken 200 tons of ounce stuff and
over: at 87ft. the reef, 9ft. wide, prospects
about 30dwt. The Gladstone was abandoned
about 20 years ago, when the owner (a
bank) and the tributors disagreed. Here
the shaft is down 300 ft., and the reef is
sft. wide. The 7266 tons of ore mined be-
tween 1901 and 1910 averaged 14dwt. llgr.

The Swedish Electrical Prospecting Co.,
now surveying the Wiluna district (W.A.)
on behalf of English and Australian inter-
ests, has achieved successes elsewhere. In
1924 the co. discovered large gold-arsenic
deposits at Boliden (Sweden). Here the
only surface indications were a few boulders,
mostly covered by swamp. The Imperial
Geophysical Survey, under Broughton, Edge,
found that salt water, which is prevalent
at shallow depths in the more arid parts
of Australia, prevented any wide application
of his electrical prospecting method. The
Swedish co. may be able to overcome this
difficulty.

Associated Northern Blocks is seeking capi-
tal in London to reopen the Victorious and
Gimlet South at Ora Banda (W.A.). A
half-mile of tramline connects the Gimlet
with the plant on the Victorious, which is
the only mine outside the Golden Mile where
telluride has been found. Lack of water
and refractory ore were the difficulties in
the past. Manager Alex. Drummond figures
that about £12,000, including £7OOO for a
new 700 ft. shaft, is required.

Lake View and Star is hard at work in
an effort to lift its output to 1500 tohs of
ore daily' from March 1. Considering its
extensive , development programme is not
complete, that is a big tonnage to get. When
work, on recently-discovered .ore deposits is
more advanced, improvement in both tonnage
and grade should be simple matters.

At the Norseman (W.A.) the 470 ft. level
has been opened up for a length of 320 ft. *
Throughout this distance the reef. Oft. wide,
averages over 12dwt. The co. intends de-
veloping the show to a depth of 670ft.’ and a
battery is to be erected. Meantime, calls
will be regular; hopes are that the rbpoi-ted
developments at 470 ft. -will be repeated at
670 ft.

North Kalgurli has come to be regarded
as the mystery show of the Golden Mile.
Between depths'of 366 ft. and 830ft.', main
levels have been extended up to 1100 ft.
from the shaft, and in the stopes a width
of Bft. of I2dwt. ore is exposed. Yet the co.
is content to have its ore treated by other
mills.- At a price it would sell out, of course;
but the figure. may be too high to attract
a buyer, even at the present, paper price of
gold.

Princess Royal (Westonia) has struck
another pegmatite bar in a winze from the
No. 4 level. Similar occurrences werefmet
with in the higher levels, where the reef <
was subsequently found all right underneath
the bars. Still, these bars are unwelcome
intruders; they partly replace the reef with
hard, worthless rock. The other side of the
story is that, had it not been for the peg-*
matite and similar intrusions, there pro-
bably would have been no gold in the reef.

Ivunanalling Gold (W.A.) got 730 z. from
a first crushing of 21 tons. The stone came
from the Melva Maie, where a narrow vein
of quartz carries high, values. The co. hopes
to win enough during the option period to
pay the purchase price of both the Melva
Maie and Star of Fremantle.

BRIEF ANSWERS. *'
. A. 8.: (1) No, but there will be minor fluctua-
tions. (2) The future of Consols will largely depend
upon’ the amount of new money for which the Gov-
ernments come on to the market. They have agreed
to finance public works expenditure after .June 30
by public subscriptions instead of Treasury bills
Basso: See B. 8/2/’33... .Inquirer, Milthorpe: The
shares offer prospects of immediate returns, while
the bonds are long-term speculations. For the present
shareholders derive their profits from the sale of
bonds; bondholders depend for their returns . upon
the sale of forest products in the future... .Anxious:
Sit tight for the time being. The scrip has recovered
from 3s. to ss. in the market during the last few
months. Trade for the first quarter of the current
term is said to have been profitable, and the dry
spell in the nor’-west has broken.


ANY SUGGESTIONS TO OFFER?
A Call to the Elders
Dear Bulletin, —A suggestion I would
like to make is that you consider starting
a crusade calling on our elders, in the cause
of patriotism, to stand aside voluntarily and
allow younger minds to take control of our
destinies. We younger men answered our
elders’ call in 1914, and we now ask them
to reciprocate in 1933 and allow us to pro-
vide for our future and the descendants of
those who gave their all in the war. —Yours,
,T. A. H.
Added Costs
Dear B., —Causes of high prices to con-
sumers are (1) too many retailers and (2)
long credit and bad debts, augmented by
high cost of securing orders. In the average
railway township in a farming area, with an
urban population of from three to four
hundred, there will be three hotels (one or
two too many), two bakers, two butchers,
two barbers and probably two picture shows,
being one too many in each instance ; also
half a dozen mixed stores, where two or
three would be ample. This small place is
visited by a troupe of “commercials” who
travel and are catered for on first-class
lines —I have seen as many as five arrive
in such a township on one train and spend
a day in the place. Added to these is the
herd of agents who canvass a district after
a prosperous season and talk the settlers
into purchasing more machinery, tractors,
motor-cars, insurance, etc., than they can
afford; of course, all on t.-p. To meet the
position, all goods should have the price
paid to the manufacturer plainly marked
on each article. —Yours, X (Q.).
Trade in Land
Dear Bulletin, —Most of , our trouble
about land values in Australia is due to-real-
property legislation designed to make, land
a subject of commerce and, as an inevitable
consequence, of speculation. In Australia
one buys a' piece of land to improve, and
sell at a profit, or-not to improve and wait
for a boom. A more reasonable system would
be to. make land a Subject of use only, from
which profit could be won only by keeping
and using, it; I suggest that perpetual lease
is in some way better thani the present
system; yet it is not as satisfactory as free-
hold to the proprietor, and I would suggest
the grant of an inalienable fee simple to the
man and. his heirs, subject to a condition of
defeasance on failure to use or cultivate, as
the case might be, and to abolish all rates
and charged on the land. Such an
owner would then know that, notwithstand-
ing droughts and low prices and debts, so
long as he worked the, land he and his sons
were assured of means of livelihood and a
roof over their heads for ever. Money could
only be borrowed by stock mortgage, liens
on wool and crop or bill of sale. Security
of tenure would make up for the lessened
tenure.—Yours, Biversleigii (Vic.).
Aid to Prospecting
Dear B„ —If, when a bit is available for
assisting the gold-mining industry, a few
little batteries, cheaply erected and run by
suction-gas or crude-oil engines, were erected
on some of the old fields in N.S.W., where
there are still auriferous if low-grade reefs,
men would be found in plenty to get out
stone and do their best to keep off the dole.
Victoria and W.A. show what a valuable
asset small State batteries, crushing at low
cost, can be. Instead of anything so prac-
tical, the N.S.W. Mines Department simply
shovels out £1 a week to all and sundry, the
choosing being left to the police, who in
many cases don’t know a miner from a cow,
and frequently pick the last people local
mining men would dream of selecting. The
whole affair is a cross between a farce and
a tragedy, and is simply looked upon as a
sort of super-dole, mining being only a
side-issue. The least conscientious don’t
work at all, a few genuinely try what they
think likely places, while others dig useless
holes close to their camps or homes. The
last outbreak was remarkable for much coun-
try where no miner ever found anything being
perforated by £-a-week prospectors.—Yours,
Quidam.
Boys’ Employment
Dear Bulletin, —You draw attention to
our effort in Westralia to “make the boy
farm-minded” (B. 13/l/’33). In 13 months
1565 lads have been placed in positions,-
1350 of them on the land, and have uni-
formly reported that they are well fed. Their
appearance certainly indicates that their
food has been good and plenty of it. The
Bpys’ Employment League has received
under 3 p.c. of complaints concerning the
boys, and under one-third of 1 p.c. of com-
plaints against the farmers. This league
knows of no case where a boy has displaced
a man. But since the commencement of the
league’s operations the unemployment pro-
blem among men has diminished by nearly
2000, from which it may be gathered that
the employment of juniors is having a favor-
able effect on the employment of seniors.
The boy-employment problem is full of para-
doxes and illogical situations, which cannot
possibly be met by regulations, red tape or
the like. Unorthodox situations can be met
only by unorthodox methods. We earnestly
suggest that the farmers in the other States
do as the Westralian farmers have done—try
a boy for a fortnight or three weeks. Our
experience is that the trial more often
than notjmds in permanent employment.—
Yours, Fred F. Cross, secretary, Boys’
Employment League (W.A.).
Life Assurance Taxation
Dear 8., —lt is up to the directors, man-
agement, policy-holders, etc., of our life
offices to get on to their feet together and
make a protest against the taxation of this
the- highest form of thrift—an impost that
has grown to appalling proportions during
the last few years. The annual reports refer
to increased taxation as being largely re-
sponsible for reduced bonuses, but no united
effort is made to resist this. I understand
the total assurance in Australia exceeds
£600,000,000. Surely those interested could
make their influence much felt, instead of
submitting to be milking cows for the
Treasuries. Unless a protest is made, where
will it all end? Let those responsible for
leadership bury all jA’lousies in a huge com-
bined move. —Yours, Slocum (Q.L
The Harbor Bridge
Dear B.,—N. S. Wales Minister for Trans-
port Bruxner told a deputation that Sydney
Harbor Bridge was costing £507.000 p.a.—
upkeep and interest on borrowed principal.
Revenue amounted to: Toll payments,
£147.000; contributions from councils,
£94,000; earnings from trains and trams.
£80,000; total, £321,000. This leaves a
shortage of £186,000, which amount the
Minister naively admitted “had to be found
by the general taxpayers, many of whom would
never see the bridge.” Doesn’t it occur to
the Minister that it would be more equitable
to tax the army of pedestrians who usr the
bridge daily? If, say, 62,000 people walk
across it to and from the city every
then a toll of one penny would earn m 12
months this £186,000. —Yours, L. Liz.
Dam Building
Dear Bulletin, —The last heavy storms
in my N. S- Wales district did much damage
by flooding, through the breaking of a dam
with over a million gallons of water. Living
in a valley, because of its fertile land we
are subject to and expect floods, which
spread gently and enrich the soil, although
at inconvenience and loss at times. But
the breaking of the dam, built in the hill
country, caused a wall of water that swept
all before it. Seeking redress we find that
there is no provision in the L.G. Act as to
control over dams on private property. It
seems any man can build a dam with no
proper embankment, even. though, should
it break, it may endanger life. Isn’t this a
serious defect? Water conservation is essen-
tial and praiseworthy, but safe methods
ought to be provided for. We can’t build a
shed without council permission, yet we can
make a reservoir that might drown hundreds
if it burst. This is a matter the Country
party should tackle.—Yours, Flooded Out.
The Woolgrowers’ Council
Dear Bulletin,— The recommendation of
the Commonwealth' Wool Inquiry Committee
that a Woolgrowers’ Executive should, he
formed was opposed by the Australian Wool-
growers’ Council at a recent .meeting. Ihe
widespread approval with which the recom-
mendation was received by growers through-
out Australia offers no justification for tin
opposition, of the Woolgrowers’ Council, and
in the circumstances something more than
a repetition of its frequent assertion that
it represents 90 per cent, of the woolgrowers
is required to explain its attitude. The
fallacy of such assertion is exposed by the
fact that the National Wool Association,
embracing 38 district committees in Queens-
land alone, and the Southern Woolgrowers’
Association of "Westralia, authorised to speak
for 90 per cent, of the small growers of
that State, forwarded resolutions to the
Federal Government denying, the right of the
Woolgrowers’ Council’s claim to represent
them.
It is time the credentials of this domi-
neering body were thoroughly overhauled.
It is one of the few remaining war-time
creations which have been allowed. to out-
live the special circumstance to which they
owe their origin. It was formed to assist
the Central Wool Committee during the
operation of the contract with the British
Government for the purchase of the Aus-
tralian woolclips. and what is of more im-
portance in view of the authority it exer-
cises to-day in relation to the grower of
wool is the fact that he was never con-
sulted. —Yours, Harold Sims.
Women’s and Children’s Footwear
Dear Bulletin. —It seems a pity that
Australian makers go on producing foot-
wear which is unsatisfactory to the wearer.
The trouble lies in the fit of the instep. It is
true some lines are built up and stiffened to
overcome the “gape” and “rucking” up which
happens after shoes have been worn a couple
of tim§s. But this means further discomfort,
with no real improvement. “Heel-gloves”
are now being sold to keep the shoes from
slipping up and down. This would not be
necessai-y in well-cut, properly-made footwear.
A burning question to-day in many house-
holds is how to procure comfortable foot-
wear for women and children. Hundreds
are suffering with foot troubles of various
kinds, invariably brought about through and
aggravated by badly-fitting shoes; so the
question of health conies into this matter,
too. The seam at the instep, in my opinion,
is the cause of all the trouble, Yours,
Lesley Murdoch (Tas.).
An Unearned Increment Tax
Dear B., —The landowner has been singled
out for a special tax, really a capital levy,
assessed annually. If bondholders, depositors,
etc., were levied, similarly, _ there would be
an outcry. It is not a crime to own land
above a certain value. Why, therefore, single
out the landowner? There is. however, a
class of landholder who might well he taxed
out of existence, namely, those who hold
land solely with the idea of selling at a profit.
The tobacco boom is a case in point. Land
that for years has been rated at from 10s.
to £1 per acre is being sold in pocket-handker-
chief farms, many of doubtful value, at £lO
per acre or more. During the post-war land
boom, men holding good land, originally
selected at 2s. 6d. per acre, were able to get
as much as £lOO per acre for specially-
selected blocks. Fortunes were made by
going off the land by men who were saying
“Go on the land, young man,” to returned
soldiers and others. A cure for this evil
would bo an unearned increment tax. Say
a piece of land is sold. A valuation of all
permanent improvements and crops, etc.,
should be made. This should be deducted
from the purchase price. From the balance
the average rateable value of the land over
the previous 10 years should be taken. The
difference would be the unearned increment.
If the tax took 75 p.o. of this amount, to be
divided between the Federal and State
Treasuries, land speculation would not be
quite so popular, and plenty of good land
would'soon be available at a reasonable price.
—Yours, Frtar Tuck (Q-).
Call-ups and Communists
Dear 8.,- —On February 13 N. S. Wales
unemployed were ordered to report eii masse
to various depots, given a small questionnaire
and told to fill it in and return it on the
following Monday. On that day they
assembled again—some had to walk many
miles to do it —handed the paper in and
went home. Now, if these call-ups are not
absolutely necessary they should be avoided.
To bring together thousands of dissatisfied
men provides a Heaven-sent opportunity to
the Communist. I know every man attend-
ing at my depot received, a Communist leaf-
let. utterly ridiculous but terribly dangerous.
—Yours, Kendall.
Untrained Citizenship
Dear Bulletin, —How much considera-
tion is being given to the welfare of
the State? How often have sections of the
community gone to the Government like
mendicants when a little self-reliance would
have rendered help unnecessary? All because
of the comfortable though dishonest thought
that the State is like a cow that can never
go dry. Now for my plea. How many young
men or women of 20 years of age can give
an intelligent opinion as to what constituted
good government? What instruction is now
given in the school that would furnish them
with some idea of the proper relation ol:
the individual to the State? As to the
Church, very little of the religious instruc-
tion given has a direct bearing on this sub-
ject. “Country Ped” spoke lately, of the value
of moral example. Where can it be had in
sufficient quantity? Who is the better fitted
to give good training in citizenship—-the
parents weltering in inordinate political
selfishness or the school and Church trained
:u:d (I hope) qualified to give instruction in
truth? —Yours, X. Cocky.

Brave New Wor'd
On behalf of. Frith, myself and other prac-
titioners of the ancient and honorable craft
of caricature, I wish to extend a hearty
welcome to the exhibition of modern British
art brought to Melbourne by Mrs. A lloy no
Zander and now on view at Newspaper
House. It will be gratifying to Frith in par-
ticular. being an Englishman, to know that
Where the inventor of the low-pressure
tyre got his inspiration .
such eminent fellow-countrymen as Augustus
John, R.A., Richard Sickert, R.A.. .Philip
Oonhard, R.A., Charles Sims, It. A.. Paul
Nash, Jacob Epstein, Frank Dobson and
Henry Lamb have discovered their true
metier and joined our venerable art, and
mystery. A gracious condescension will, I
am . sure, be extended towards their first
tentative efforts in the new medium, for it
must be confessed they are as yet mere
amateurs in the art of distortion,‘deforma-
tion, addition and subtraction. One’s fingers*
itch, for instance, to" complete the work of
devastation .so timidly begun by Mr. John
on the countenance of the Marchesa-,Casati.
The. eyes are not without merit, but a couple
of feet added to the nose would undoubtedly
have arrested the' attention of the public
more effectively.
To a practising caricaturist the work of
Mr... Epstein is frankly disappointing. ' Con-
sidering this sculptor’s enormous reputation
and the excitement and admii-ation his sculp-
ture has aroused in London, one expected to
see at least an Aphrodite, with two Lgft* legs,;
whereas his busts almost come under, the
categox-y of concrete realism. Amongst the
sculptors Mr. Dobson is the only one who
gets anywhere neat realising the true ideal
of the caricaturist. His “Susannah” was
doubtless the fount from which the 1 inventor
of the low-pressure tyre drew hi's inspira-
Mr. Paul Moniford giving insignificant

tion; and his “Head of a Woman” was
obviously the _ progenitor of the submarine
or. trench periscope. One would wish Mr.
Dobson to go further in the distension of
the human figure until he loses a year’s work
through over-inflation.
Caricature is one of the oldest forms of
art. Ancient Egyptian art is usually grave
and sombre, yet it furnishes numerous
examples of caricature, while in the arts of
Loses a year’s work,
owing to over-
inflation.
Greece and Rome
caricature had an
important position.
During the Middle
Ages it flourished
in every European
country. The
Greeks called it
“g e 1 ce o g raphy,”
w T hich means some-
thing like laugh-
writing. The laugh
then, as now, was
probably all on one
side of the face pf
society—the other
side failed to see
the joke, being the
subject-matter of
it. It is said that
leading comic jour-
nals have standing
orders from Aus-
tralian Parliamen-
tarians to send
them the originals
of cartoons holding
their political oppo-
nents up to ridi-
cule, and it is
alleged that S. M.
Bruce went fui’ther than this and at
one time bought all the best cartoons
levelled at his then party chief, the invalu-
able Billy. Gelceography was later given
the name of “caficatura” by the Italians,
a race of people who caused trouble by cut-
ting throats in Sicily, and now cause even
more trouble by cutting cane in Queensland.
Caricatura means to load something on or
into something—a mule or a bomb, for in-
stance. People who load mules eventually
end by overloading them; as, for example,
Federal and State income tax authorities.
Caricature hence means .both to load and
overload something. Frith illustrates both
aspects. ( He loads his gun by overloading
Mr. Hang’s, countenance. It is characteristic
of good caricature that this overloading be-
comes standard weight—a ' new Plimsoll
mark, so to speak—and it is impossible for
lesser practitioners to' create a new stan-
dard. Frith’s Lang has spread like an eczema
over ,the fair face of this continent, just as
Low’s W. M. Hughes and “Hop’s” Reid did.
I have personally made desperate endeavors
to escape from the domination of Frith in
this matter, but with no success whatever.
The object of caricature is to realise the
ludicrous, and in effecting this object idealisa-
tion should be ignored and ordinary artistic
values, treated more or less, contemptuously.
Caricature pure and simple is thus a
degenerate form of art. When, however, il
is made the vehicle of satire and thus aban-
dons its usual function (to amuse) and rises
to a higher one—to teach—it must be
regarded as a , w'orthy and honorable form
of artistic expression. It is to be regretted
that.few, if any, of the exliibitoi's in Mrs.
Zander’s show understand these simple
axioms. They obviously take themselves
intensely seriously. This is especially seen

M. G. S.
. 'The story-telling method of Mary Webb
is an accentuation of the method of many
more popular but not quite such literary
novelists. She endues the peasantry of
Shropshire with the emotions and imagina-
tion of highly-sophisticated poets and
painters and makes them express these
spurious fancies in language the polish of
which is enhanced, rather than disguised by
a judicious use of the local dialect. Ex-
tremely artificial writing, but the tale if?
usually one well worth telling. The author-
ess s most famous work “Precious Bane”
(the term is borrowed from Milton) has
oeen dramatised by Edward Lewis, and the
play was performed at Sydney Savoy on
Saturday night by the Independent Theatre
players, with Doris Pitton as producer. The
three-acter, in which a great deal of the
literary ornamentation of the original has
been retained, seems to have made a very
strong appeal to the playets. It is not easy
stuff, and the slightest clumsiness in handling
it would have been fatal. But it was in
intelligent hands, and : the production, which
was staged with rarp skill and taste, was otie
of surprisingly high merit. Arthur Lane’s
characterisation of old Beguildy was perhaps
its outstanding feature, but Mr. Lane’s
talent would not have shone so brightly
had lie; not had excellent backing from the
rest of the cast. The performance was not
perfect—no stage performance ever is—but
this Showman knows no group of players in
Australia at the moment, amateur or pro-
fesional, who could have done the thing
better.

It’s a far cry ’from Bayreuth to Mac-
quarie-street, but Sydney’s’Con. Hall sported
a hidden orchestra and resounded to strains
to which the shade of Richard Wagner
migjit have listened without loss of temper
on a’recent evening. Wagner’s idea of opera
was a performance in which the ear. the
eye and the brain of the audience should
rejoice together 'like the stars of the morn-
ing. This only happens in real life at such
golden moments as that in which Melba
sang her most tuneful aria ' in “Rigoletto”;
when the picturesque Paderewski plays his
pretty" little “Minuet,” and when Toscanini,
most graceful of conductors, ushers in the
majesty of the-“ Ninth.” Wagner’s fiftieth
death-year celebration in Sydney could boast
nQthing like that. But it opened with a
spirited orchestral excerpt from “The Plying
Dutchman,” and gave a good idea of 'the
first act of “Tristan, and/,lsolde,” with
Madame Goossens-viceroy as Isolde and Ila
Turnbull as Jirartgane. Also, iorehestrally.
there was a remarkably good performance
of “Siegfried’s Journey to the Rhine.” The
orchestra was more satisfying than the
singers, but good orchestral players are born
every day, and Wagner singers only once
every twenty years.

Sydney Repertory on Saturday presented
four Grand Guignols and a Petit Guignol.
Best of an exciting quintette was “The Right

Roberts sparkled. Another good characteri-

“The Vultures.”.

Poverty Point
“A. Major” : This year that part of the
musical world that bothers about anniver-
saries is celebrating the 50th milestone that
has been passed since the death of Richard
Wagner. Like Schumann, Wagner was a
journalist as well as a musician, and Nor-
daii’s theory that he was mentally degen-
erate is disproved to the satisfaction of any
student of logic who cares to read his essays.
He had self-conceit, but less of that com-
modity than Beethoven had ;■ revolutionary
ideas of opera, but Gluck pioneered them, and
their sanity has been given the compliment of
copious imitation. He wrote what the first
great prima donna who sang it condemned
as “eccentric stuff”—he had, as other critics
complained, “no melody, no form.” Spohr s
experience was that of every other musician
who took the trouble to try to understand.
He wrote: “A good deal that I disliked at
first I got accustomed to on repeated hear-
ing.” Schumann, a much more discriminat-
ing critic, wrote in 1846, with only “Tann-
liauser” to go upon, praising the instrumen-
tation and the technique. Wagner was .helped
by the patriotic decision of the powers tiiat
were in the Germany of his later period
that he.must be boosted, but the whole world
of music to-day agrees with the dictum of
the old kappelmeister in a second-rate Ger-
man town who, when he was told that the
audiences didn’t like Wagner’s music, replied
placidly, “Then they must hear it till they
do like it.” Wagner was short of stature;
as irascible as a Welshman; a great reader.
He believed that his mission was to reform
the opera in the light of Beethoven, but his
devotion to the great Ludwig was never a
matter of imitation.
“Churcher” : Adelaide Repertory Theatre,

ship getting close to four figures, and re-

“Ought to be prepared to shave in it.”
“Norbell”: I know an out-of-work actor,
an eminent man in the days of the drama,
who lives in a Melbourne suburb, A broad-
casting firm .’phoned to him on a recent
Sunday, asking him to call at once. He did
so (return fare Is.). He was invited to
do a leading part on the following Fridav
in. a broadcast play. He was told to call
on the Tuesday for his part. He did so
(return fare Is.). Then he was told to
attend rehearsal on the Thursday. He did
so (another Is. fare). Then on the Friday
he had to attend at ten o’clock at night to do
the broadcast. This cost him another Is. in
fares. Then he had to attend on the follow-
ing Friday (another Is. for fares), pay-day,
to receive liis fee. He was paid ten shillings.
“ J.”: It took the talkified version of
“Rain” to convince me of something I had
long suspected—that Maugham’s much-
boomed opus is less a work of art than a
yarn, drama or anything else. There isn’t
a word of truth in it. When you read
Maugham (what a writer!), or. see his mis-
sionary played by a near-genius like~Barry-
more on screen or stage (ahd I.have seen
Barrymore do both), you are liable to be
carried away. But then Barrymore doesn’t
play fair; he makes the missionary a virtual
lunatic. Walter Huston portrays a more
or less normal man of God. Such men are
ministering to natives and others in thou-
sands all over the world, and it is the rarest
thing for one of them to go astray. With
a wife in the vicinity the odds against would
bo. millions to one, even, if the convert was
willing, which Sadie of course was: not.
The insistent rain is blamed: for the evan-
gelist’s sudden lapse. A purely theatrical
idea. It rains continuously in other parts
of the tropics during the monsoons, and no
one is affected ; nor is there a valid reason
why anyone should be affected. Rain has
no more effect on the nerves than the drone
of. a trade wind. So “Rain” is a fake. The
missionary would have behaved as he. did
whether it had rained or not, but only if he
had been the half-demented creature depicted
by Barrymore. And they don’t make mis-
sionaries of semi-lunatics.
“O. Kay”: Australian Claude Flemming,
who is returning to his native land to pro-
duce travelogue pictures in color, got
his footing in Hollywood as a “dialectician,”
teaching films stars how to speak correctly.
Then he filled minor roles in “The Green God -
dess” (with Arliss), “Mamba” and other
films. Now he tours the world making
travelogues. A Sydney man, he started on
the stage with the Royal Comic Opera Co,,
and later appeared in “Sweet Nell of Old
Drury,” with Nellie Stewart. In 1906 he
accompanied Miss Stewart to flic U.S.-A.
At one time he was a singer in Wagnerian
opera at Covent Garden.

and was educated at Newington .College, had

“F.A.R.” (Hollywood): I suppose: every
theatre-goer over 35 remembers Leslie Gaze,
who came to Australia to play lead in “The
Chocolate Soldier” and broke many silly
women’s hearts in the process. He left the
stage and ran a squab farm in Victoria for
some years. I;ran across him and his second
wife in Hollywood a few nights ago. H'is
first wife died tragically on their return
voyage from Australia to England. Present
spouse is a brilliant pianist. Gaze still has
a delightful voice, but he has definitely given
up the stage. He has a high position with
the New York Equitable. But he still herds

The Palette.
Of the seven water-colorists whose third
annual exhibition is at Melbourne Athe-
naeum, B. Heffernan and John A. Gardner
show the most advance. The progress of
the others is imperceptible. John Gardner,
is the artist who, with his peripatetic friend
Rex Battarbee, penetrated the dim interior
of the continent in search of game some
years ago and returned with a w r ad of can-
vases which were interesting mainly for the
novelty of their subjects. On their second
trip Gardner took a better sense of color
and tonal values than his mate. Battar-bee’s
pictures only hint that in the centre of Aus-
tralia there are some amazing effects, such
as cliffs so ruddy that they suggest haunches
of fresh meat. In the fantasy department is

THE FARMER’S FRIEND
The paper for
THE MAN ON THE LAND
is
THE PERTH
nxtiav
For over 35 years the leading weekly news-
paper in Western Australia-has been in close
touch with the Man on the Land in all his
activities —it has been his friend and guide.
The farming pages of the big Western weekly
newspaper are a fund of information for
settlers, hence the reason why the circulation
■of “The Sunday Times” in the rural centres
of W.A. is unequalled. Wherever you go in
the Golden West —the largest town or smallest
liamlet —you will find “The Sunday Times.”
The large subscription list for. direct postage
is sufficient tribute to the popularity of the
paper amongst the farmers.
NATIONAL ADVERTISERS
If you have a message for the farming com-
munity of the West, it will pay you to use
“The Sunday Times.” You will profit as
hundreds of others have done, because you do
not have to experiment here. It is a medium
proved to be in close touch with the Man on
the Land, and remember, W.A. is the great
primary production State.

SHADOW SHOWS.
“In the Wake of the Bounty,” at Sydney
Prince Edward, is a disappointing produc-
tion. It begins with a reconstruction of
.some of the occurrences which are supposed
to have led up to the most uneventful mutiny
in history. The spectacle of an angry
old man being hustled about in his night-
shirt by a gang of stage _ tars comes as an
anti-climax after the exciting scenes on ships
that audiences have been accustomed to by
Hollywood. Eighteenth-century Tahiti fol-
lows. The untutored savages are not merely
clothed, they are overdressed. Of course the
censorship is to blame. But why should the
producer have bothered about such adrama-
ric subjects as Tahiti and the Mutiny when
he had ready to his hand one of the most
thrilling human stories on record —the early
struggles of the settlers on Pitcairn? Apart
from the tragic interest of the conflict which
left only one of the mutineers alive —a blood-
thirsty scoundrel who presently got religion
and made his subjects as saintly as himself
—these happenings alone explain the
islanders of to-day. The film begins to grip
the attention when the photographer reaches
Pitcairn. There is nothing “arty” about
his work. It is good, clear representational
photography which takes in every imagin-
able aspect of the agricultural, industrial
and social activities of the inhabitants.
There are also scores of fine shots of the
island from the sea, and of the sea from
the island. As a travelogue, “In the Wake
of the Bounty” is well up to world-standai’ds.

Bert Smith was a London policeman who
did his duty when a millionaire’s daughter
(Lady Viola Brown) broke the traffic laws,
though she pouted reproachfully, snapped
her eyelids at him, sighed, gyrated, grinned
winsomely and tried to hold his hand. So
she got him a job in her noble father’s oil-
works, where he assumed an officer’s uniform,
with Sam Brown belt complete, and started
giving a squad of privates revolver-drill every
morning. The millionaire’s secretary, Vis-
count Maltravers, was in with a thug
named Jasper Simpson, who had arranged
with a flying ace (Major Eric Plantagenet.
D.F.C.), to bomb the oilworks. Just as
the bombardment was about to begin Bert
leapt into a truck, hooked a military search-
light, which happened providentially to be
on his parade-ground, to the back of the
truck, dashed off to Hampstead Heath and
turned on the beam. This deceived Plan-
tagenet into wasting his bombs on the
searchlight. The announcement of the en-
gagement of Mr. (ex-Constable) Bert Smith,
of 375 Mile End-road, to Lady Viola Brown,
daughter of the Marquess Brown, of Bel-
grave-square, and Petrol Castle, Sussex, was
announced next day in the “Morning Post.”
Such, in an Anglicised form, is the plot of
“State Trooper” at Sydney Regent. Regis
Toomey is the holiest man in blue, Evalyn
Knapp is the aristocratic speed-merchant
whose vigorous eye-work wins his heart in
the end, and Edwin Maxwell is her father.
The catastrophes are astonishingly well
done.
“Dangerously Yours,” also at the Regent,
has a better cast and an even more asinine
story. Warner Baxter is an American
Raffles operating at the Long Island palace
of Florence Roberts —masterly as a genteel
inebriate. That splendid English low com-
edian Herbert Mundin is a confederate pos-
ing as his valet. Miriam Jordan watches
them narrowly on behalf of a jewellery-
insurance company in a succession of eos-
f umes that would be liable to get her warned
off any Australian beach for being in-
adequately clothed. Comes a stage when
Warner kidnaps Miriam and puts her aboard
his yacht. For some reason .which this
critic missed—the sound was none too good
on Saturday night—Warner forcibly
attaches a small chain and anchor to one
of her legs. She lias her meals with him,
promenades the deck and is made love to
: while wearing this contraption. After some
extremely boresome dialogue regarding the
; ethics of theft, Warner is converted, returns
the jewels, gets a marriage, license" and sets
sail with Miriam for Ireland. Had the pro-
ducer been concerned with the eternal truths
of life a concluding sequence would have
shown the inhabitants of Ireland refusing
to admit the bride till she bought herself
seemlier garments, but truth is the last
thing this kind of producer bothers about.
The photography is admirable —particularly
the Long .Island and shipboard interiors—
and Mundin has some good lines.
“The Miracle Man," at Sydney Empire,
was seen in Australia as a silent in T 9.
This version is no less exciting, sentimental
and unreal. The. big moment comes when
the faith-healing go-getters discover that the
village patriarch is what they have been
claiming him to be. A crippled child discards
his crutches. There is no holding back the
crowd of sufferers. Money pours in. And
next the crooks themselves are saved, and
determine to devote the proceeds of their
fraud to a good cause. Chester Morris,
Sylvia Sidney, John Wray and Ned A.
Sparks are the crooks, and Hobart Bos-
worth is the snowy-haired old saint.
“Hot Saturday” is frank flapper fodder.
Nancy Carroll toils in a bank in the inter-
vals of being chased by designing males.
Cary Grant, a rich young holiday-maker,
sends her home in his car after she has
narrowly evaded the infamous attentions of
a bank clerk. Scandal connects her name
with Grant’s. The unfortunate maiden, fired
from the bank, sneered at by her own mother,
flees in despair to an old sweetheart, lie
is on the verge of marrying her when the
rumor about her conduct reaches him and he
backs out. Enter Grant, marriage and
eternal happiness. William Collier, sen., is
sound as the persecuted heroine’s father.
* *
Noah Beery and Niles Welch make the
current Western at Sydney Haymarket worth
while. It is called “Cornered.” In “Doctor
X” foggy waterfront streets, morgue in-
teriors and a roomful of skeletons serve as
background for Lee Tracy’s fatuous gagging.
Lionel Atwell is Dr. X, round whom sus-
picions gather like flies on an abo.’s dog.
The climax comes when • three doctors, all
suspects, stare, handcuffed to their chairs,
while the actual malefactor, his features dis-
torted to the semblance of a panto, giant’s
mask, pauses in the act of slowly choking
Fay Wray to indulge in some cheap skiting.
That proves his undoing. Quite a gobd
thriller.

ABORIGINALITIES
“Kerberos”: Brisbane was the scene of
an unusual gaol delivery recently. The
dogs’ home at Yeronga was full to over-
flowing, and the edict had gone forth for a
general execution parade the following day.
Came the dawn, as the movie captions used
to say, and with it a telegram from a pas-
toralist somewhere in the back of beyond.
It demanded every dog in the home virile
enough to chase his own fleas and fixed a
price per head f.o.r. The order was filled,
and the train departed with its burden for
the great open spaces where men are men
and rabbits are just hell. The job before

“Wantagal”: Two young Scots, carrying
their swags, arrived with empty tucker-bags
and stomachs at a Vic. country town where
the R.C. priest had the reputation of never
refusing an applicant for tucker. Jock
McTulloch decided to give his name as Pat
O Ileilly, to better his chance of a hand-out.
Donald Cameron wouldn’t disown his name
tor the world, let alone for a feed. Arriving
at the presbytery, they interviewed the sog-
garth, gave their names and got a sym-
pathetic hearing. His reverence Remarked
on the fine old Irish name one of them bore
and with a twinkle in his eye rang for his
housekeeper and instructed her to take Mr.
Cameron in and give him a good dinner.
"The other gentleman,” he said, "can have
as much bread and water as he likes, this
being Ash Wednesday.”

"Honi Pikau”: Old Henare Waipire, who
was the subject of a prohibition order, had
two bottles of whisky in his saddle-bag.
lie was intercepted by a policeman when
half-way to liis kainga at Arolia Waliine.
“11a!” exclaimed the John Hop as he un-
earthed the two bottles, “whisky, eh? Where
did you get this, Henare?” Honare’s
features depicted abject bewilderment. “Tat
whisky not mine, poss,” he blandly answered.
“Well, how d.o you explain for it being on
your horse?” demanded the policeman. A
look of dawning comprehension illuminated
Menu re's dusky features. “Py Cliove!

“Gad”: Here at Rossel one observes a
currency in use amongst a primitive people
whose social organisation is based on the
elementary principles of Communism. From
time immemorial these Rosselites have used
as a medium of exchange tokens which arc
minted from some sea shell. The generic
name for these tokens is darh , but whence
they came, how the issue is controlled and
how varying values are distinguished are
chasms which pidgin English fails to bridge.
An old native gave me an insight into the
darh currency the other day when lie said:
“Some big men, maybe, have 20 darh”....
which explains, I fancy, why some Ross,-)
men possess two or three wives, whilst others

“Wai-hoi” : When the Far North’s history
is. written there’ll have to be space for a
stick or two about one of the most remark-
able journeys ever done up topside, that of
Alexander Forrest’s party, which, 54 years
ago this month, left the De Grey River-
station (W.A.) with six months’ tucker to
map the country between there and the Vic-
toria River in the Territory. Forrest had
a devilish time in tackling- the King Leopold
Ranges, as he called them, about 100 miles
back from where Derby now swelters at the
head of, King Sound, but he was beaten in
trying to get through to the Glenelg. where
the Port George IV. Presbyterian Mission
is now a tiny touch of civilisation on a long-
empty coastline. Forrest’s only recourse was
to go east for over ”00 miles in order to
cut the O.T. line, which he did at the end
of August, but not before he and his com-
panions had drunk the blood of a large
hawk which they shot the day before they
reached the humming wires near Daly
Waters. There was a bit of a beano when
the thirsty crowd got to the Katherine, and
they had a few more at Darwin before they
sailed in the old Atjeli for W.A., via Sydney.
Forrest, when he was Mayor of Perth in
the ’nineties (brother Bigjolm was then
Premier), told me that for straight-out
hunger and thirst, as he knew them, this
Kimberley-Darwin trip of his in 1879 took
the palm. But the most practical memory
of the expedition is that it made known the
existence; of ■ 25,000,000 acres of pastoral and
agricultural lands, much of which still cries
to Heaven to be settled.

“Pick”: Ibis mobs, having selected a
western river’s morass (N.S.W!) for their
communal hatchery, aggressively chase from
the region the inhabitant grebes, spoonbills
and herons. The newcomers’ homes are
clever examples of bird architecture. In
the swamps grow clumps of a lignum with
long pencil-like stems. Numbers of the

shove, bunches of the wiry stalks are'bent
over and interwoven to form a platform
about 3ft. above the water. On this deck-
ing the nesters. construct their edifices of
twigs, leaves and shredded reeds. They
cluster together in thousands, and when a
boat passes along the stream or a gtih-dog
flounders amongst the rushes, the disturbed
hatchers darken the air in numbers beyond
estimation, while the peeking cries jof the
forsaken broods fill the welkin with’ shrill
wails. On their raised piers the fledgelings
are safe from any ordinary fresh in the
adjacent river, but dire tragedy overtakes
them when an outsize in floods sweeps their
domain.

“Murrungurry” • An important item in
the abo. dispensary is the 1 mud pills—and
there is no quackery about them either.
They are carefully compounded of soft clay
and an extract of herbs. Binghi’s know-
ledge of the curative properties of plants
is. extensive, and the mixture with mud is
his way of tabloiding. The pills are con-
venient to carry in Maggie’s dillybag. and
may be kept for months. The doctor’s
laboratory is the fireside, where essential in-
gredients are boiled or roasted or crushed
with stones. The clay is kneaded on a sheet
of bark, and the learned apothecary rolls
the little pellets .with his fingers, lie has
pills for various ailments, including a char-
coal pill for headache’. The late “Jimmy
Pannikin” (Donald Fraser), the school in-
spector, was a~ firm believer in charcoal for
this complaint (it absorbs the gases in the
stomach). Soft clay or stiff mud is also
applied to bites and stings of insects, and
as a plaster over cuts'and spear wounds,
The mud is carefully selected, generally at
the water’s edge of a creek, gully or lagoon,
In places this natural plaster is impreg-
nated with eucalyptus or other properties,
according to the local vegetation, or there
may be some mineral agency. It is always
taken from the brink of wholesome water
and at a spot where animals do not drink.
Barring precious stones and
old postage-stamps, not many commodities
can fetch 20 times their weight in gold.
This, however, was the approximate price
that the breeder of the first “angel fish"
in Sydney secured for his hatch. These
decorative little fish, so called from their
curious wing-shaped fins, hail from the
Amazon and are the latest rage with people
who 'own electrically-heated aquariums.
Their bodies, seen sideways, are nearly cir-
cular, and measure about 34in., but they
are little more than half an inch thick, so
that when they all face up to a .sudden tap
on the glass they apparently disappear with
the sudden magic of a conjuring trick. A
less desirable trait, from the fancier’s point
of view, is their voracious appetite, for in
captivity they never seem to stop eating.

“Du Barrier": Close by the Cairns-Port
Douglas road, now under construction, a
seven-foot brown snake tackled a nine-foov
python, sunning himself -in a clearing. After
a few lightning passes, the brown buried his
half-inch fangs in the enemy’s neck and in
a few seconds the python was dead. One
of the road-workers watched the fight, wanted
a snake-skin, drove brownie away with
stones (from a safe distance) and dragged
the dead python the two or three hundred
yards to the camp. But he had a friend
whom he wanted to frighten, so before pro-
ceeding with skinning he arranged the
python artistically on his mate’s pillow and
hid himself to watch the fun. Presently
there was a rustle in the grass, the brown
snake wriggled from under the tent-wall,
made a bee-line for the coiled python on the
bunk, and began the swallowing act. The
problem of accommodating nine-foot python
in the belly of seven-foot broxynie didn i
worry him. But presently bedrock, was struck.
Several feet of python sticking out of his
mouth and completely helpless. Mr, Brownie
paid the penalty for gluttony when tin
human watcher recovered from his astonish
ment. A cam p of-a hundred men inspected
the snake-with in-snake exhibit and got the
tale hot from the-oven.

“Pick”: The common belief that black-
fellows are immune from the effects of snake-
bite was not supported by an occurrence at
Yalwal (N.S.W.) a few summers ago. There
an a bo. linesman employed by a surveyor,
whilst squatting at their camp fire, unsus-
pectingly put his hand on a death-adder that
had slithered out of a fire-log. Feeling the
bite the abo. seized the reptile and flung if
into the fire. lie watched the enemy squirm
ing and frizzling in the glowing coals, and
laughed softly when the burning flesh
crackled. Then slowly he. sank back, arid
had drawn his time before his companions
could commence the little they knew ol
snake-bite remedy.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I see the splendid hues from her bright
brush
On field and forest laid ;
The trembling russet of the aspen-trees;
The gold of every shade
Upon the fern. Does Nature pause because
My bills are all unpaid?
Not she! With all her old historic calm
She goes unmoved her \yay;
She flings her largesse round on every side,
With none her hand to stay.
She has no cause to pause and meditate
On who the deuce will pay!
She sets the bloom on the hibiscus-tree
With an unruffled grace,
And twines the jasmine round the latticed
porch
In trails of emerald lace.
Hers not the need to be concerned about
The mortgage on the place!
A warm wind blowing oyer sun-browned
grass
Shouts with a' vibrant voice.
I take it Nature means to indicate
There’s reason to rejoice;
She’s even sent a bulbul round to drown
The gasman’s clamorous voice.
I gaze upon her handwork for a hint
Of sympathy with me
(Or any chump in like unhappy plight),
But nothing do I see
Except stupendous proof she doesn’t care
How rotten things may hi-.
Not if the whole world in depression’s grip
t Falls with a violent thud!
Not if the race of man goes raging out
In trails of fire and blood!
She merely turns her back and gently stoops
To mould a primrose bud.

“R.A.P.”; We have on our farm a cat
that revels in the society of treat-
ing humans and cats witii cold indifference.
She is often to be seen lying- serene and at
ease in the midst of a yardful of cud-
chewers. As diversion there is frequently
a mock fight, ■ for all the world like that
between two kittens. The calf attacks, with
sloppy nose and rough tongue. The cat
defends, from a prone position, with all

“Porosus”: North Queensland's latest
crocodile tragedy is an unusually poignant
one. Two little girls who rode daily to
school and back on the one horse failed to
return in the evening, though later the horse
with his coat and saddle wet turned up at
the hom6stead. Their road lay through a
ford of a river frequented by crocodiles, and
immediate search was made there. In the
morning the body of one girl was found
downstream, but no trace could be found of
the other. The horse was not marked, but
it is thought that in crossing the ford he
was frightened by a crocodile and shied into
the deep water, where one of the girls was
taken by the brute. Owing to the croco-
dile’s practice of burying his prey under the
bank of the water-hole he frequents, it is un-
likely that the body will ever be found.

“Pteropus”.: .What is claimed to be the
largest flying-fox camp ever seen in Queens-
land has been located in the Milmerran
scrub on the Darling Downs. For some time
the fruitgrowers in what is known as-the
Granite' Belt between the Downs and the
N.S.W. border have suffered heavy losses
through unusual numbers of the big fruit-
eating bats. The camp, discovered as tin l
result of an intensive search, is in thick belar
and brigalow scrub, and covers some 10
acres. Though the trees average 40ft. in
height, every inch of them, from top to bot-
tom, is covered with the bats, the branches
being weighted to the ground, while
the green of the trees is hidden under the
reddish-brown mass of the foxes. As the
density of the scrub is about three trees to
the square yard, some idea of the numbers
of the horde may be formed. A shooting
drive is to try to shift the camp, but this
only means it will form elsewhere, while
the losses from the guns will be infinitesimal.
There is a fortune waiting for the man who
can discover a means of dealing with this
pest, which in Queensland is as serious
to the fruitgrower as the rabbit is to the
grazier.

“Dog-tax”: A reputation as a marathon
runner is being established by a small curly-
tailed-black dog belonging to a fireman of
the narrow-gauge train that runs between
Upper Ferntree Gully and Gembrook (Vie.).
Three or four times a week “this dog accom-
panies the train on its journey, not travelling
in state, as he might, but trotting along
many yards behind. lie catches up at the
stations, and trots off again the moment the
train resumes its run. At Gembrook he
sleeps or chases rabbits, and occasionally
jumps into the fire buckets to cool himself,
because the-return trip is made, downhill to
a faster schedule. More speed is naturally
required, but the dog has the advantage over
the train in that he can, and does, cut
corners,

“Karaway”: The home-made water-pipe is
still used in parts of N. S. Wales. In the
Turn barumba
district there is
a line of them
36 miles long,
which carries
the water for
sluicing to the
goklgetters at
Mann’s Creek.
These pipes are
fairly large
poles of moun-
tain ash, cut
and bored near
Turn barumba,
and are con-
nected with iron
rings. Th i s
sort of work in
the busy times
gone by was a
considerable in-
dustry. Many
a Sydney resi-
de nt, when
shingle houses
were the rule,,
was served with
water through
ironbark pipes.
One of them
was unearthed
at the Town
Hall during the
excavations for
the city rail-
way. Straight
•saplings were
selected for the
purpose, an d
cut in lengths
running up to
40ft. All the
sapwood was
removed, and a
hole was bored
up the centre
with an auger,
which easily
followed the
comparatively brittle heart of the sapling.
The, pipes, even in damp ground, proved
very durable.

_ “Eureka”: Manna was the food sup-
plied to the Israelites in Arabia. Those
Arabian trees must be closely related to the
big white gums of Southern Monaro and the
far South Coast of N.S.W. In summer the
ground, under these gums is simply white
with manna, and as soon as school’s put
children make straight for the trees to
gather the dainty, which has a delicious
taste. When the surface supply is exhausted
the children dig out ants’ nests for the
manna these insects store away.

“Salmon Gums”: A peculiarity about Aus-
tralian field plagues is that they arrive in a
night, apparently from nowhere, and, when
every attempt at eradication has failed,
depart as quickly and mysteriously. T have
in mind an army of cutworms which in-
vaded portion of
the Westralian
wheat belt about
20 years ago. No-
thing that we could
think of had any
effect, and we
weren’t lacking in
initiative tlio s o
days, either. I
ploughed furrows
around my crop,
and dug hoi: s
every few feet
along the bottom.
Killed millions, but
they got the crop
—every blade of it.
A neighbor drove a
thousand sheep
back and forth
across his pad-
docks, until the
ground was boggy
with squashed
worms, and the
sheep grew poor
with travelling. It
didn’t make much
difference. At night
the air was thick
with moths, poten-
tial breeders of
millions. Next
year we didn’t see
one. Later we
had an invasion of
mice, folio-wed by
an army of cats.
Whether the cat;
ate the mice and
then turned canni-
bals, or whether
some other para-
site got them both.
I can’t' say, but in
turn both plagues
disappeared. An
English farmer
who studies .statis-
tics says that over
a period of So
years a plague of
leather-jackets (the
progeny of the
daddy-long-legs) has occurred every five
years, each bad year being preceded by one
moderately bad. A study of the periodicity
of Aussie pests might be helpful.
“FY7”: Machinery continues to displace
man power in the shearing-sheds as else-
where. A new idea for treating cuts made
on sheep by woolhawks is described in the
journal of the Council for Scientific Re-
search. This is a spray gun which can be
used either as a spray or jet and in the
latter form is employed for fly-struck sheep.
On the shed board, when the shearer calls
for tar in the time-honored fashion, the
modern machine-gun unit approaches and
sprays the cut. In the writer’s youth the
apparatus borne by the tarboy was a pickle-
bottle filled with a solution of bluestone and
equipped with a rag swab at the end of a
stick. Those were the days of the hand-
shears, and when twb or three of the guns
were racing each other for a tally the
wretched youth with the bottle had to out-
vie Boyle Roche’s bird and be, not in two,
but in half a dozen places at once.

“Levuana”: One of the crumpled rose-
leaves in the couch of the grower of cocoa-
nuts in the Pacific Islands is the cocoanut
locust, better known by liis professional
name of sexava. He is a large and agile
insect, and the local birds have proved quite
unable to deal with him as they do with
smaller nuisances. As a result, the New
Guinea Department of Agriculture has de-
cided to import guinea fowls to eat up the
sexava. The spotted bird is larger than the
insect and even more agile, as those who
have tried to shoot it_in its native wilds will
testify.. When domesticated the guinea fowl
still clings to many of its wild habits, pre-
ferring to wander and nest well away from
the haunts of the barnyard fowl. This pro-
mises to be an advantage in a plantation
where the birds will patrol at their own
sweet will without need for supervision. In
addition, the guinea fowl and its eggs are
notable table delicacies, and will come as a
relief to the eternal Island round of bula-
makau and sweet potatoes.

“Kooragai”: A desirable little bird that
is reported to have almost disappeared is
the squatter pigeon ( Geophaps scripta'i. one
of the ground b'rds of the open forest coun-
try, and a great table delicacy in the bush.
It was once plentiful throughout Queens-
land ahd in the backbloeks of N.S.W. and
S.A. It associates in pairs and small eom-
panies of half a dozen or so. When flushed
all make off in different directions and, after
running a little way, squat down in the
short grass, depending for protection on the
harmony of their liglit-brown color witli the
immediate landscape, and at the last moment
rising with a startling burr. Hundreds have
been killed with sticks while squatting, and
HE COULD STILL STAY ON.

don’t milk with his feet.”
with the stockwhip and bullock-whip along-
side the roads. To Binghi with hi.s throw-
ing-stick and boomerang they were the
easiest of game. The flesh is white, and
for that reason the domestication of the
little squatter would be profitable—and the
only way of saving it from extinction. The
bird is about 12in. long, exceedingly tame,
and breeds nearly all the year round, the
nest being a small hole scratched out in the
ground and lined with grass. It is a hand-
some, plump bird, and, living on grain (grass
seeds) and always on the ground, is highly
suitable for inclusion among the poultry.

“Kismet”: Sick with my first dose of
fever, I lay on a can; lounge behind a screen
on the Island hospital verandah overlooking
the Strait. The blue of it burnt my eyes.
I was little and far away, for this fever
had taken me at a mean time—my
hospital was overfull of sickness, and I
should have been about. In a lull of the
sou’-west trades footsteps came shuffling
along the coral walk and a kind voice called
softly: “Missee, you here?” “Yes.” Then
a brown old gnarled hand came round the
screen holding a tiny green-glazed flower-
pot of lovely China lilies. “I filing; you a
pletty flower to make you better.” It was
Lau-lee-Kee, the Chinese storekeeper, whom
I had never before seen. And quickly I
got better.

“Mundowie”: An allegedly haunted cattle
camp on Mentone Downs, on the Ward River
(N.S.W.),has a peculiar history. There is a
fine lagoon on one side, and stretching away
to a wooded creek is a wide grassy plain—
a capital place for a drovers’ camp. But
the quietest mob is restless there, whilst
others rush in wildest panic. Long ago
there was a pub on the edge of the downs,
facing the lagoon. A man who had been
down with cattle camped at the lagoon and
lost his horses. Between looking for them
he was drinking at the hotel, and one day
he. was found dead on the plain -with his
bridle alongside him, According to travel-
lers’ stories, a spectral horse-hunter was
seen now and again afterwards wandering
across the plain at dawn with a bridle on
his arm. I didn’t have the luck to see the
spook when I camped there, but a selector
who had occupied the site of the old pub
was completing the removal of the habita-
tion to far back on the creek because the
women reckoned the place was haunted.

MY MEMOIRS.
(Written specially for the “Evening
Prawn” by Horace Dustyfist, vice-captain of
the first Under 12 team of two to leave Aus-
tralia.)
No. 593.
Now we come to the fifteenth Test against
Little Puddleborough Academy. It had
rained overnight, so Fudger, our skipper,
gave me first shot when we won the toss. His
strategy paved the way for our victory. The
home team had last use of a ring that was
extremely worn after I had knocked the
connie-agates about for half an hour. The
great Tommy Tores, many times threedioles
champion of his school, congratulated me
after that match. Nevertheless I consider
that I played an even better game next day
against Ditchwell Orphan Asylum. I always
look back on it as one of the most brilliant
feats of my long and splendid career.
CLUB STEWARD: “ Yessir; the late Mr. Fuzzgig, sir, died in his
sleep three years ago.”
NEW MEMBER: “But what! What!”
STEWRD: “His last instructions were, sir, that he was on no
account to he disturbed."
Owing- to Fud'ger’s errors we were
a long way behind; but I gritted my
teeth and pulled the game out of the fire,
achieving the well-nigh impossible. You
should have heard the crowd cheering. I
was carried shoulder-high from the play-
ground, for, although their own side had
been defeated, the spectators were not slow
to recognise the master-hand. It was not
for some time that I was able to escape;
but when I did I found poor Fudger in
tears beside the garbage-tin. “Never de-
spair,” I said. “The day may come when
you too will be a Bradman of the sport we
both love so well.” He has since told me
that those heartening words were the secret
of the resounding success which was to come
to him in later years.
A eonvulsingly funny episode occurred
during our visit to Ditchwell. “Commony”
Jones, the Big Ring crack, while doing some
exhibition shots, failed to knuckle down.
“You never knuckled down, ‘Commony,’ ”
•said I. “I seen yer, so it's no good saying,
you did.” “I never knuckled down,” he
confessed, “an’ I’ve never knuckled under
neither ; not to no one, I haven’t.” Now,
you cricket-reminiscers, beat that one, if

Pekin. —Bitter disappointment is felt here
at the successes of the Japanese. In
reference to a powerful leader in the Wnn-
Li “Kamerad,” Field-Marshal Lung is re-
ported to have said: “I quite agree with the
editor that had we but enjoyed the help of
the Aussie genius Jack Lang victory would
have rested with our colors.
“ ‘The world’s greatest man’ is a phrase one
often hears in China when the name of the
Auburn Labor leader is mentioned,” pro-
ceeded the Field-Marshal. The Field-Marshal
said he had been a regular reader, of the
“Labor Daily” since the first issue.
Five Dock. —The powerful local branch
of the Unemployed Bullwashers’ Union car-
ried a smashing vote of confidence in Jack
Lang and the “Labor Daily” by no less than
seven votes to five last night. Mrs. Emma
Goof, who has just returned from Moscow,
paid a warm tri-
bute to the Toilers'
Idol. “Th| brain

she observed,
“the physical vigor
of a Genghis Khan
and the simplicity of
a Little Child —such
are our great lead-
er’s outstanding
qualities. Lang is
Light!” The speaker
concluded by urging
all to buy the
“Labor Daily.” The
branch resolved by 12
votes to nil to con-
tinue refusing to pay

ness of the union

Grace—an irnplac-
a ble foe of every
form of proletarian
sport-—rejoice that
Lang is fighting the
battle of the needy
in our sunny Aus-
tral land rather than
in that home of

CORRESPONDENCE.
To the Editor. Sir, —Despite the saintli-
sayings of Bert Stevens, despite the infamous
press. boycott, despite the manoouvrings and
machinations of cliques and gangs and
oligarchs who want the party to stand by
its policy of socialisation for their own base
purposes, our great leader and his mighty
organ of public opinion, the “Labor Daily.’’
continue like twin battleships to forge ahead.
Long, sir, may this state of affairs con-
tinue. Buy the “Labor Daily,’’ and urge
your friends to do likewise. Shun the capi-
talistic press as a thing accursed. In this
way, though you may miss news, you
will improve the value of the debenture-
holder’s equity.—Yours etc., Constant

His fingers have hammer-ends from con-

Admirers say he is “the best defensive

tell him that his natural game
is (a) “fighting with his back
to the wall”; (&) “going for

all.
Newspapers say that (1) Ir-

his old artistry has completely
gone, (3) his brilliant natural
sparkles ever more
brightly with added experience, and (4) he
is clearly finished as a Test player. He be-

AFTER THE TUMULT.
Some members of the Journalese Assoc.
(Cricketing Sub-branch) were discussing
matters over brimming beakers of printer s

“I’m glad it’s all over,” said Uppish Shot.
“I’ve been averaging seven to the column in
Associated Newspapers over the last five
months.”
“I’m lucky,” confessed Brilliant Recovery.
“The ‘S. M. Herald’ took me up and used
me four or five times per issue.”
The newest member, Vicious Bumper,
spoke up. “It’s my first season,” he said,
“but if this keeps up the comps, will have
to render first aid.
I’m practically a cot

GOOD HARVESTING PERFORMANCE.
Robert McCrone, of Bungambil, near
Temora (N.S.W.), wlio has been wheat-grow-
ing for 52 years, says lie doesn’t remember
so. satisfactory a harvest as the one that
was taken off this year. Bungambil is now
managed by his son Max. who had charge of
Ml the arrangements. They had. counting
in share-farms, something over 2000 acres
under wheat, and 3840 acres was cut for
grain. From the 3840 acres they took off
an average of over 29 bushels. But it wasn’t
the crop so much as the way it was taken
"fl that, was exceptional. One share-farmer,
with the assistance of one man, stripped
400 acres for an average of 33 bushels in
Id days—over 35,000 bushels, a daily aver-
age for two men of nearly 400 bags. The
whole crop 0 f over 52,000 bushels was taken
off and delivered into the silos in 19 days by
32 .men, including four engaged in bagging and
transporting to the siding—a haul, certainly;
of no more than about two miles. The eight
men in the field had six machines, all but one
of. them horse-drawn ; the tractor was in the
hands of a very competent mechanic and gave
gieat satisfaction. The bags were, of course,
not sewn; they were skewered/emptied and
returned for use again. The transport to
siding was done by two motor-trucks from
Sydney, which shifted six to seven tons in
a load, and did 30 miles an hour. The crop,
besides being heavy, was exceedingly well
grown, none of it had gone down and not
an hour was lost through bad weather dur-
ing the harvesting.
, But T. J I en it: comes to'.price, Mr. McCrone
has a different tale to tell. Including the
wneat sold this season, the average price
™*ted f° r the past three years has been
-2d.; and after 52 years of experience
ne declares he knows no way of making this
meet expenses even in an ordinary good'sea-
son. let sheep are an even poorer proposi-
t ion, and Mr. Max McCrone intends to prac-
tically cut out sheep in the coming year
and put another 2000 acres under wheat.
ghurka for THE WIMMERA.
The Vic. “Journal of Agriculture” draws
attention to the success achieved with
tdiurka a comparatively new variety of
Wheat bred at Werribee. Over the last
six years in comparative trials at Lon-
gerenong College it lias given the best aver-
age, 34.7 bushels per acre: Free Gallipoli,
now the favorite Vic. variety, was second
with an average of 34 bushels. Ghurka is
characterised by a very short straw and free
stripping qualities. It has a greater survival
value than other varieties, as shown by the
number of ears produced per 300; stools.' On
this point the following interesting figures
arc given by two^of the- departmental re-
search officers:—
about 0 2 < n W to tj ?n S ’ SUC £- as .Straw,.,..produced
about 20 to 30 ears for every 100 stools. Federa-
V? 1 " Produced last year in Victoria about 35 tc
about 40 tn r ir/ V tools; ri Fn ’ ( ’ Gallipoli produced
about 40. to 45; Ranee. Rajah and Waratah, about
•TO to .).). Ghurka produced about 60 to 70.
Ghurka, the research officers say, is doing
veil wherever it is being grown. It is speci-
ally recommended to Wimmera farmers It
also gave good returns last season on. red
sandy country in the southern Mallec It
is a late-maturing variety.
WHEAT VARIATIONS.
“P;, E - Re ‘ r|l .” : wheat grown in the
7®" ‘ous countries of the world :is more or
"n- 111 ty P e and composition, with
milling characteristics and pecti-
a mmfn Whl(!h ai ’° exposed (very often in
a most pronounced manner) when the flour
is put through.the bakers’ troughs. However
strange it. may, seem, flour differences are
bservable m the same wheat when there
is variation m soil and climate. A blend
of flour milled from a definite wheat mixture
in one J ear may require only one or two
doueh "’whe' trough to obtain a satisfactory
gh ’ui wh^ rea ; s 111 the following year the
same blend of flour may take five turns
before it satisfies the baker
Again the methods of bakers vary widely,
A small baker in the country who resorts
a°beautifulMn/f f w often able to turn out
a , . loaf from a flour or flour blend
cal 1 Inixer°lvi 1 i baker i employing the meclmni-
? ’• condemn. Similarly a flour
from a given wheat will produce in one
season a dough noted for fast working—
possibly ready in three or four hours—fnd
requiring particular eare on the baker’s part
if it is to produce good bread ; and in another
season may take six or eight hours to
“prove” in the trough, and without trouble
gives ideal bread.
Experienced millers and bakers (the latter
especially) have many tricks in their trade
which overcome variations in the wheat,
even where too much of the one variety is
grown. . Wheat is not imported into Aus-
tralia for Hour-production or blending, as is
the ease in Europe; and yet by blending
of local wheats flour is manufactured which
turns out bread equal, if not superior, to
that consumed abroad.
The German .Government has passed a
law prohibiting more than 3 p.c. of foreign
grain in wheats blended by the millers unless
the latter can arrange for the export of
local wheat to offset that imported. How-
ever, tin l imported wheat milled in any case
must not exceed 30 p.c. in the mill blend.
German wheat is a low-strength soft white,
and the solution to the problem seemed to
be the importation of the highest-strength
wheat available. But it w r as soon discovered
that'shipments of the same variety of strong
wheat from U.S.'A. varied so extensively in
milling that, where it took 20 p.c. of one
shipment to produce the desired improve-
ment in the flour, ,30 p.c. of a second ship-;
ment had to be used in the blend to produce
a similar result, in spite of the fact that
laboratory tests showed practically no dif-
ference between the shipments. Flour from
American hard wheats needs, special treat-
ment for the .production of first-class' bread.
Taking everything , into consideration, I
am of the opinion that a natural wheat blend
such as Australian f.a.q. capable of pro-
ducing a first-class bread flour when milled
would create more than ordinary interest on
the Continent at the present juncture.
OATS AS GREEN FODDER.
“Mercury”; “U. Murray’s” interesting
and practical contribution (B. 15/2/’33)
suggests some remarks on the palatability of
varieties of oats as green fodder. In B.
9/11/’32 “WescoCky” mentioned a farmer’s
experience with Mulga oats in Westralia and
gave me rather a shock by stating that the
cow’s were turned in when the crop was
only three weeks old. Mulga is known as a
quick-grower, but such treatment would be
rather rough on a crop that would have
practically no. roothold in that brief time.
While farming in tlie Urbenville (N.S.W.)
district I sowed a small paddock of 'Alger-
ian in March ,for winter feed for the cows.
When on the last round in broadcasting I
ran short of seed. A narrow strip with
Algerian on either side was left; I had some
Mulga, and I ;-sowed that. The result was
an object-lesson. Algerian was slower, but
in weight of fodder, yield and palatability
it was streets ahead of Mulga.
. The herd -was-turned in on that oats late
in May. The Algerian w r as oaten down to
the edge of the Mulga, which was left stahd-
ing- until the Algerian was grazed sufficiently
to assure a recovery for further growth.
The • Mulga was coming to car when the
sliprails liad to he put up. In the result
that, strip of Mulga was almost a dead loss.
By the time the cows were turned in again
it was matured so far as to be bitter and
quite unpalatable. It bad scarcely been
touched, and when the plough was put to
work again in that paddock most of the
trampled Mulga was turned in.
HUGERNE IN UNLIKELY PLACES.
“Golightly” ; Lucerne is the king of fod-
ders, and the plants that find their way down
to permanent water are the most valuable.
Farmers whb.se land is bare and brown for
most, of the summer may find, by planting
lucerne, that underground soakage exists
where it is least expected, and that parts
ot their holdings may thus be converted into
permanently green lucerne patches. Any-
way, ,'t his has been my experience.
Years ago I bought a property on the
Central Tablelands (N.S.W.). Old hands
assured me that lucerne wouldn't grow there-
but I went ahead to establish, on compara-
tively high country, a fairly large area of
grazing,lucerne, believing that it would pay
to re-sow every five years, if necessary Con-
siderable portions of the sown area reached
permanent moisture in some of the most
unlikely portions of the paddock; sometimes
low-lying patches dried off with drought,
while hilly parts stayed green. I have
observed the same tiling on other holdings.
Lucerne finds moisture if it’s there: in my ‘
case it took three years for the roots to get
down to the soak.
Grazing lucerne dependent on rainfall only
is invaluable for fat-stock production.
Lucerne with its feet in moisture is still
better, and is always worth trying for.
SACCALINE FOR C.Q.
‘'C. Q. Coast": Saccaline is a fodder crop
the value of which is not fully appreciated,
especially in those parts of Australia .which
are subject to frequent dry periods or irre-
gular rainfall. It is particularly adapted to
the coastal districts of Central Queensland.
It germinates well, grows quickly—reaching
the seeding stage, at a height of Bft. or more,
ten weeks after germination in a good
season—and bears a heavy tonnage per acre.
It can be grazed off, chaffed up or made into
ensilage, for which it is very suitable. The
grain is good pig- and fowl-feed. Saccaline
is an excellent milk-producer, and is relished
by cattle, horses and pigs. Above all, it i.s
drought-resistant. Once above ground
saccaline will grow or remain alive until
rain falls, when it soon springs into vigorous
growth.
In Central Queensland sowing can take
place from the beginning of August to the
end of March with good results. For grain
or pig-feed (the green stalks make a capital
bulk ration) the .seed should be drilled in
to a depth of 2in. to Sin.; plants spaced to
2in, to 4in., drills 2ft. (Jin. to 3ft. apart.
For grazing purposes the seed can be sown
thicker in the drills or broadcast at the rate
of 101 b. per acre. If a cultivation paddock
has become overgrown with weeds a good
crop of fodder can be grown cheaply and
quickly by broadcasting saccaline among
the weeds (even though the weeds are 3ft.
high) and ploughing seed and weeds in with
a furrow 3in. to 4in. deep. Two inches of
rain will give excellent germination. During
the wet Mason, on new scrub farms, the
seed will strike and grow well if broadcast
among the stumps of freshlydburned-off land.
The great drawback is that at one stage
of growth saccaline contains prussic acid
and is poisonous to stock. There is much
argument as to when danger-point is
reached. I have watched, this sorghum fed
to cattle, horses and pigs of all ages at
all stages of growth, without serious results.
Yet I have known farmers who have grazed
it at all stages for years without loss sud-
denly lose several head. There was one in-
stance of a dairy herd of 28 head being
wiped right out. But I have never heard of
a case' of poisoning except when the cattle are
grazed. If the saccaline is cut and allowed
to lie in the sun for a few hours the prussic
acid disappears. It can then be either fed
whole or chaffed up. If a little molasses is
sprinkled over the cut fodder it is an added
safeguard. If it is necessary to graze it
off. the precaution should first be taken of
turning in two or three less valuable stock,
and'if these are unaffected the herd can be
turned in. But even if grazing is considered
too risky, saccaline is. a fodder crop well
worth growing for either ensilage or chop
chop.
THE SHEEP BLOWFLY PROBLEM.
The sheep blowfly costs the Australian
wool industry some £4,000,000 annually.
The Council for Scientific arid Industrial
Research and the N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture have-been conducting investiga-
tions into the problem, with a view to finding
an effective method of dealing with it. A
committee of four experts was established,
with Dr. J. A. Gilruth as chairman, to
co-ordinate the work of the two bodies and
to advise on new avenues of investigation
The result may be seen in a pamphlet
edited by Drs. R. J. Till.vard and 11. R.
Jseddon: lucidly written, it is well illus-
trated _ with drawings and photographs.
A special feature, is a colored frontispiece
showing the different kinds (of blowflies
responsible for fly-strike. This should enable
anyone to determine the particular type of
blowfly infesting his flocks—a matter of
more importance than at first appears.
These flies arc divided into three groups.
The primary group includes those varieties
which begin an attack on the living sheep
by laying eggs or larva? on it, and whose
young can sustain themselves on the sheep.
The secondary flies are those which do not
initiate the attack but follow the primary
flies and take advantage of the condition's
created. They are often more damaging than
their predecessors. The tertiary group may
be said to, complete what the varieties which
have gone before it have accomplished. The
factors influencing the increase of the flies
and the susceptibility of individual sheep
are fully dealt with. The primary flies occur
throughout the countrv save in the extreme
north ; the secondary species are found prac-
tically everywhere, and especially in tropical
and sub-tropical areas.
One conclusion on which the investigators
are agreed is that the pest cannot be com-
bated by any one method. They give
detailed instructions as to the treatment of
strickeii sheep, and the processes of erutching.
jetting, swabbing, clipping and dressing are
dealt with and illustrated in the clearest
fashion. Crutching is described as “of proved
value”; jetting “is of distinct value when
undertaken immediately prior to or after
a strike-wave.” Another point insisted on is
that selective breeding may reduce suscep-
tibility.. the predisposition to crural strike
being hereditary and recognisable. A full
description is given of the Mules operation
for removing the parallel skin folds .on either
side of the breech of some sheep, which tend
to the staining of the wool and subsequent
fly-strike. Trapping, poisoning and the treat-
ment and disposal of carcases also receive
full attention. Biological control, unfortu-
nately, “holds out little promise of'success.”
The report can be got for ts. Gd.. post free,
from the C.S., and 1.R., 314 Albert-street,
Melbourne, or from the N.S.W. Department
of Agriculture. No slieepowner can afford
to be without it.
MYCOTIC DERMATITIS.
“Lias”: This disease, often erroneously
called scab, has become fairly prevalent in
many districts during the last few years,
and, as it is infectious, prompt measures
are necessary when it makes its appearance.
The cause is a fungus, which forms a scabby
mass on the skin. The treatment entails a
good deal of handling of the sheep, but does
not otherwise appear to be difficult.
The first step is isolation. The sheep should
then be shorn, with machines if possible,
though the matts may be too thick for them;
in that case get as close to the skin as you
are able with the tongs. Three weeks or so
off shears they should be given a good soak-
ing in Cooper’s Quick-acting Powder Dip,
regular strength. Immerse them for at least
three minutes and do all you can to get the
liquid to soak into what remains of the
scabby masses. Give them two or more
swims at fortnightly intervals, and then turn
them out until the wool is sufficiently grown
to permit of their being shorn again, say,
in three months. After this, two or more
swims, again at an interval of a fortnight,
and I think the worst case will have re-
sponded to the treatment; that has been my
experience, at any rate, and I had some bad
examples. After each shearing burn all the
wool and thoroughly disinfect the Shears.
BEATING BUNNY.
“Valerin’ : It is impossible to lay down'
hard-and-fast rules for exterminating rabbits ;
peculiarities of a district, nature of the
country, seasonal conditions and so forth
must be taken into account. Money is squan-
dered and energy misdirected in wrong
methods. I have seen men pumping a costly
fumigant into a warren; an hour later rab-
bits were sitting on it, blowing the dust off
their chests.
Before investing in panaceas and gadgets,
have a yarn with a man who has had experi-
ence of rabbits. P.P. Boards should appoint
men who have practical knowledge of the
business and can help others to tackle the
job. There’s not much sense in prosecuting
unfortunate settlers.
Netting at £7O per mile (including cost
of erection) is out of the question; prices
for wheat and wool do not justify the
expenditure.'
TICK ERADICATION.
“Babb Dwyer”; Another point in favor of
rotational grazing-*—it is an aid to tick control.
From the time the minute tick attaches
itself to the hide of a beast until the en-
gorged female parasite quits her host to
deposit eggs in the grass approximately
three weeks elapse. Young ticks cannot be
starved out by simply leaving tlie pastures
unstocked, for experiments have showed they
are capable of surviving for as long as a
year. Burning-off, treating with pasture-
renovating harrows and top-dressing un-
doubtedly get rid of a large percentage.
Dipping is at present our only sure way
of filling ticks, but dipping alone will never
completely eradicate them.
OLD RAILWAY SLEEPERS.
“Mulgo”; Thousands of railway sleepers
are periodically pulled up and discarded as
worn out in various parts of Australia.
Most of these are sound, and of good solid
hardwood. Bft. long, 9in. wide and 4Jin.
thick. These make good fence-posts "for
farmers, and graziers, and would be eagerly
bought if taken to centres where timber for
subdividing is scarce. It: would cost the
department practically nothing when trucks,
or some of them, are running empty.
Besides their suitability for fencing, the
landholder could find many other uses for
the sleepers, such as decking culverts over
gullies, fixing approaches to dams or other
watering-places, making cowbails and sties,
floors for sheds and for the haystack. As
the sleepers are all split timber, most of
them are straight-grained, and therefore
could be split again, furnishing two slabs
Hin. by 2in., allowing for wastage. These
would do for walls for stables, fowlhouses

In wire-fencing these sleepers would go
a long way, for tlio majority of them could
be split in two, making 4in. by 4in. posts
(trimmed). Three or four of these could
be used between the heavier posts, and if
the bottoms were tarred their duration would
be considerably increased. In yard-building
they would make 7ft. 6in. panels, the sleepers
being split in two broadways for the rails.
In many places material for the purposes
mentioned have, to be carried long distances,
and the discarded railway sleepers, often
wasted or wasting in thousands, would be

QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
Best dip to use to cure foot-rot. in sheep,
and method of using? —4676.
The dip should be compounded of blue-
stone, Boz. to the gallon of water. In obsti-
nate cases 51b. of formalin to 25 gallons
of water may be used to advantage. The
time taken to effect a cure will depend upon
the degree of disease present and cannot
be estimated. Cases which do not respond
to treatment should be disposed of.
(1) Is pig-farming profitable in N.S.W.?
(2) Most suitable breed? (3) Best locality
and suitable area? (4) Capital required? —
4761.
(1) Yes, provided you have cheap food,
and that you keep your pigs clean and
healthy. (2) Pure or crossbreds of Berk-
shires, Tam worths, Large and Mid-Whites.
(3) Anywhere on well-drained land where
crops could be grown. Area may vary from
5 to 50 acres. (4) £5OO or more, depending
on the class of pig-farming you intend going
in for and the start you require. Ask N.S.W.
Agriculture Department for pamphlets on
the subject.
(1) Is there a market for M.L. Danthonia
grass seed in Australia? (2) Price? (3)
A antes of firms handling the seed? (4) Is
it, used in lawn mixtures? —46Bo.
(1) A bit of a one; seed is imported in
small quantities. (2) About Is. per pound in
Australia at present. (3) Anderson and Co.
and Arthur Yates and Co., both of Sydney,
and F. H. Brunning, Ltd., Melbourne.
(4) No.
(1 i Names of firms in Vic. and. S.A. sup-
plying wind-driven dynamos? (2) Voltage?
(3) Is a constant supply of electricity
assured during periods of no wind? (4)
Minimum wind speed at which they will
operate? (5) Can the current, be used to
operate an electric radio receiver or house-
hold appliances ? —4704.
(1) Webb Bros.. Ltd., 286-290 City-road,
S. Melbourne, and Hannan Bros. Ltd.. 58-
62 Flinders-street. Adelaide. (2) The “Free-
lite” supplied by Hannan Bros, is made in
two types, a 6 volt and a 12-volt; the “Win-
lite” supplied by Webb Bros, at various
voltages from 12. (3) Accumulators are
supplied with these machines, from which
current is available during windless periods.
(4) 6 m.p.li. to 10 nip.h. (5) Most elec-
tric radio receivers require a 240-volt 50-
c.vcle supply for their operation. A small
motor-generator would be necessary) Suffi-
cient current is pi-ovided by small machines
for lighting about six rooms, using two 32
c.p. and four 15 c.p. lamps. The larger
sizes are suitable for operating the usual
electrical appliances, such as vacuum
cleaners, refrigerators, etc.
What manures and. fertilisers should be
used in tobacco-growing and how and when
applied? My tobacco plot is in ALL. —4781.
Immediately after winter ploughing lime
should be broadcast over the land at the
rate of 1 ton per acre the first year and .4
ton each following year. For air-cured
tobacco the following fertiliser mixture (per
acre) is recommended in the case of new
lands known to be poor: scwt. superphos-
phate (44/46 p.c.), lewt. sulphate of potash.
Broadcast one-third of the manure one
month after the lime has been applied.
Work the fertiliser into the soil immediately.
The plants are planted without manure. Ten
days after planting apply the balance of the
manure. In soils poor in nitrogen it is advis-
able that the nitrates be added in a mineral
form, such as nitrate of soda where quick
action is required, or sulphate of ammonia
where a slower-acting nitrate is desirable.
Use no more nitrate than is actually re-
quired ; its use is mainly confined to sands,
light sandy loam, and poor clay soils. Where
it is intended to kiln-cure the leaf, the
amount of sulphate of ammonia applied
should not exceed l&cwt. per acre.
Where the quantity of tobacco harvested
is not sufficiently large for bulking doicn in
the approved manner, how can it be stored
after curing ? —4262.
It may be packed, after curing, in a clean
tight wooden box and stored in a warm, dry
place. For two years it will improve under
such conditions and acquire aroma in a
natural way. Before making up the leaf for
use it should be lightly sprayed with a sweet-
ened spirit if the leaf lacks natural gum;
this has the effect of keeping it moist longer
when exposed to the air.
Symptoms of wheat engorgement in
horses ? —4777.
In slight cases the animal appears dull,
with no appetite, and sluggish at his work.
The more serious cases set in very suddenly.
The horse becomes restless, paws at the
ground, looks around at its . flank, and con-
stantly kicks at the abdomen. As the pain
is more severe, the animal throws itself about
and rolls on the ground; the excitement
rapidly increases, and it is dangerous to
approach. The respiration is hurried, and
the membrane of the eye becomes yellowish.
Meanwhile the abdomen has become slightly
swollen and tense, and sweating appears at
the flanks. If no relief be obtained, the
horse becomes increasingly dull and stupid,
or the pain may be more and more intense
until death occurs.
How can I prevent a g ah'(inis id-iron lank
used for maize storage sweating?. Would
coni tar painted on one side or both ~ sides
stop it, or would paint be better?— 4oos.
Neither coal tar nor bitumen will prevent
such sweating, but an application of the
latter would prevent the iron rusting. The
cause of the maize sweating is lack of ven-
tilation, and can be overcome by aerating.
Empty your tank of maize during dry sum-
mery weather, preferably when there is a
breeze, and expose it. to the sun’s rays. In
the meantime, whilst the tank is empty,
spray the inside with a 20 p.c. solution of
formalin. Don’t refill until thoroughly dry.
During February a portion of my peach
crop was attacked by a disease which usually
covered one sid" of the ripe peach with
many small round spots or freckles, green-
ish at first, then brownish. Decay of the
fruit followed. Cause and means of pre-
vention?—l7o3.
Symptoms arc those of a disease known as
peach freckle or black spot, caused by a
parasitic fungus. Diseased fruit should be
gathered up and burnt. During winter
pruning, diseased wood should be removed
and treated likewise. The trees should be
sprayed with Bordeaux mixture or lime sul-
phur (winter strength) just before the buds
open. Agriculture Department, Sydney, will
furnish any additional information required.
Is it advisable to hot- or cold-dip sultanas
after picking? —47S4.
The cold dip is more usually used nowa-
days. Both methods have their advantages.
With prospects of a bad drying season, dull
weather, occasional showers and little heat,
the hot dip is recommended, as the fruit
dries more rapidly, but in a suitable season
the cold dip produces a better-colored fruit,
though tlie time of drying is increased from
30 to 100 per cent.; hence extra space for
drying may be necessary.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Rab” : Keep a check on the cost of dig-
ging out rabbits. Count the warrens on a
given area, dig out three or four average
ones, and note the time it takes. In hilly
and hard country, I have let contracts as
low as 3s. per acre, and the men did well;
on the other hand, deep, alluvial flats have
cost me up to 12s. 6d. per acre. The average
over a large area of station paddocks
worked out at. ss. 6d.
“Disc Harrow”: When doing circular-
saw work keep well out of line with the
blade. A block may suddenly become de-
tached, or fall from above, and in such cases
is hurled out with great speed. A neighbor-
ing farmer was recently killed in this way.
“Willeroo”: Always tip the ashes from the
kitchen fire in one piace— under a shady tree.
They make a healthy bath for the fowls;
but see that they are not hot. After rain
Clean up the heap and use it as a fertiliser.
“Gardener” : When after a property that
you intend to irrigate from local supplies,
first test the water well. Often creek and
well water is too brackish for plant life.
After spending a couple of hundred on mill
and piping, a neighbor of mine found that
the only way he could use the water was
in drills two feet from the roots —too much
wdbte ground. Many hitherto fresh streams
are going quite salty of late years.
“A.C.8.”: Fruitgrowers who have been
troubled with excessive weed growth in their
orchards will welcome a new machine which
destroys the weeds and improves the soil by
adding their potash constituent to it. With
a flame 2ft. wide the machine kills weeds
and any seed that may have fallen on the
land. A shield allows it to be worked close
up to trees without harm. It is also useful
in cleaning up headlands.
“Ten-rag” : Experiments are being made in
Maoriland with the soya bean, mainly as a
means of supplying nitrogen to the soil.
Tung Oil Corporation has planted out 100
acres of soya beans on its property in the
North Auckland province. If they are. a
success it is intended to grow catch crops
as a means of bringing in revenue, and also
of fertilising the soil for the tung-tree plan-
tations.
According to the N.S.W. “Agricultural
Gazette,” P. Morandini, of Dubbo, who got
first place in a district onion-growing com-
petition, grew a crop of Hunter River Brown
Spanish which yielded 22 tons 12cwt. per
acre. Preparation of the ground was begun
in 1031 by ploughing under an April-sown
crop. Watermelons were then sown, and
after that crop was harvested the land was
mouldboard-ploughed, harrowed and rolled
in May, 1032. and springtooth-cultivated
prior to transplanting the onion seedlings
in June. Super, at the rate of 2001 b. per
acre was applied just before planting out.
The seedlings were- transplanted 4in. apart
in rows Oin. apart, and to facilitate irri-
gation the beds were made only 10ft. to 12ft.
wide by 34ft. long.
“Hornby” : Convinced as 1 am that the best
standby of all for the sheepman is saltbush, I
was interested in the article (B. 15/2/’33)
in which it was stated: “Bullawarrie is
conspicuous for Mitchell grass and saltbush,
and in spite of the dry season the sheep are
in fine condition.” Mitchell grass is a very
fine pasturage, but we can't all have it. We
can all have saltbush in a short time by
the simple and inexpensive practice of plant-
ing it (either by sCed or slips) at fairly
long distances apart. And, although I’ve
never met the gentleman, I’m game to bet
that if anyone cared to write the manager
of Bullawarrie he’d ascribe a lot of the
satisfactory condition of his sheep to that
plant. As a native of north-west N.S.W.,
.1 know what allowing the hardy vegetable
to die out there has cost.

Information Sought.
(1) When was the first theatre opened
in Melbourne? (2) Date and nature of first
stage performance in Melbourne? (3) Who
owned the first theatre?-— 4746.
(1) In 1841 a wooden pavilion was erected
in Bourke-street in connection with the
Eagle Tavern, in which musical entertain-
ments were given, a license as a theatre being
refused. The place, becoming disorderly,
was closed by the police, but was reopened
in 1842 as the Theatre Royal. (2) Feb-
ruary 1, 1842. A performance of “The
Widow’s Victim,” followed by “The Lottery
Ticket.” (3)* The Royal was leased by
Knowles, of the Sydney “Old Vic.,” until
1884; it was then taken over by Cameron,
of Launceston.
Can you supply particulars of the first
self-propelled vehicle? —4740.
Dates back to the middle of the 18th cen-
tury. Credit for the first “road waggon”
propelled by its own engine is generally
given to Nicholas Cugnot, a Frenchman,
who, about 1770, built a three-wheeled car-
riage with a cumbersome steam power-plant
operating on the single front wheel. It is
claimed that this vehicle could run at a
rate of 24 m.p.'h., but it had to stop every
TOO feet or so to make steam. Cugnot’s
second vehicle is still preserved in Paris.
(1) Approximate analysis of molasses?
(2) It is sometimes used for fuel at sugar
mills. What is its calorific value? —4644.
(1) Sucrose, or cane sugar, 39 p.c.; re-
ducing sugars, or invert sugars, 16 p.c.;
organic substances, not sugars, 17 p.c.;
mineral substances, or ash, 8 p.c.; and water,
20 p.c. (2) Varies with water content. A
fair average value is 5380 B.T.U.’s per pound.
Three tons of molasses is equivalent to about
one ton of coal.
Mg dog is constantly scratching, biting
and licking his skin, though when examined
there is often nothing to be seen. The con-
dition occurs in hot weather, especially dur-
ing the shedding of the old coat. What can
l do for him? —4760.
After combing out all loose hair, give a
sulphur bath, made by dissolving loz. sul-
phurated potash in a pail of tepid water;
repeat every two or three days. If this does
not give relief, bathe the dog in a, warm,
Solution of borax, one tablespoonful to a
gallon of water. Give saline aperient medi-
cine, as Dinneford’s fluid magnesia, to small
dogs, and Epsom salts to large ones.
(1) In “The Man in Gray,” by Thomas
Dixon, there is an indictment of the aboli-
tionist John Brown, who is accused, among
other things, of murder. What arc the
facts? (2) Is the cavalry leader J. H. B.
Stuart, mentioned in the book, an histori-
cal personage? —4679.
(1) The reference is to the so-called
“Pottawatomie massacre” of May 25, 1856,
when men under Brown’s orders killed in
cold blood five pro-slavery settlers in retalia-
tion for the murder a short time previously
of five “Free-State” settlers. Brown was
also the leader of the famous attack on
Harper’s Ferry in 1859. He was captured;
convicted of “treason, and conspiring with
slaves and other rebels, and murder in the
first degree” and was hanged. (2) Yes.
He assisted in the suppression of the raid
on Harper’s Ferry. In the Civil War he
attained the rank of major-general and was
a fine cavalry leader.
(1) Dimensions of an otter or any other
type trawl suitable for 22 ft. launch with
6 h.p. engine? (2) Is such small-scale
trawling done in Australia? (3) Are there
any restrictions about the use of trawls in
such places as Tuggerah Lakes? (4) Would
Broken Bay be suitable as regards clear
bottom, etc.? (5) Names of any other
places handy to Sydney suitable for trawl-
ing from a launch? (6) Where to obtain
charts of Broken Bay, etc., and cost? —
4405.
(1) Beam trawl nets are the only trawl
nets lawful for use in estuarine waters of
the States open to net fishing. Full par-
ticulars as to dimensions are contained in
copy of proclamation posted. Your launch
could effectively trawl with the maximum-
siz'd. net allowed by law. (2) No. It has
bV;; 11 : but has been discontinued.
, rhoij- ujie is unlawful in all coastal
lagoons and Takes of the State, but not. in
Broken Bay. (.4.). Large portions of Broken
Bay are suitable for trawling as regards
the bottom, but successful catches are rare.
(5) There are no places in vicinity of Syd-
ney suitable for trawling other than Fort
Jackson, where the practice is illegal. (6)
Charts of Broken Bay may be obtained from
the Department of Lands for a few shillings,
but they do not show soundings or the
nature of the bottom.
(1) What is meant by piston displace-
ment? (2) How is it found? —-4700.
(1) The volume of gas displaced during
one stroke of the piston. If tin 1 combustion
space is 10 cub. in. when the piston is at
top dead centre, and 63 cub. in. with the
piston at the bottom of the stroke, the pis-
ton displacement will be 63 cub. in. for one
cylinder and 212 cub. in. for a four-cylinder
car. (2) Multiply the square of the bore, in
inches, by the stroke in inches and the re-
sult by .7854. This gives the displacement
in cub. in. per cylinder.
(1) What were the early events leading
up to the discovery of electricity? (2) Deri-
vation of the word “electricity” ? —4696.
(1) In quite early days it was known that
amber, when rubbed, would attract light
bodies. The fact is said to have been men-
tioned in 600 B.c. by the Greek philosopher
Thales. In 400 B.c. Democritus devoted
considerable study to this effect, as did Thep-
phrastus (321 b.c.) and Pliny (a.i>. 70).
No further experiments in electricity are
recorded until late in the sixteenth century,
when Dr. Gilbert, of Colchester, found that
many bodies, when rubbed, behaved in the
manner mentioned. (2) From, the Greek
word “elelctron,” meaning amber.
(1) Is anyone eligible for membership of
the Film Society of Sydney? (2) What is
the procedure when applying for member-
ship? (3) What is the annual subscription?
(4) Objects of society? —464B.
(1) Membership is by nomination and
election. (2) Get in touch with the hon.
sec., 1 Queen-street, Woolfahra. (3) Mini-
mum, ss. (4) To encourage the production
and screening of films that embody national
traditions and ideals, that reach a high
artistic standard, and avoid falsity, crude
sentimentality and vulgarity.
What is the difference between the gross,
register and displacement tonnage of a ship?
--4733.
Gross tonnage is the sum of the under-
deck tonnage and of all the enclosed spaces
above the tonnage deck, there being, how-
ever, certain portions above the tonnage
deck which may be exempted from measure-
ment. Register, or net tonnage, is derived
from the gross tonnage by deducting the
volumes of certain “11011-earning” spaces
which cannot be utilised for cargo or pas-
sengers. Displacement tonnage is the weight
in tons avoirdupois of the vessel when fully
loaded. The volume of the underdeck ton-
nage is obtained by measurement, and the
result in cubic feet, divided by 100, gives
the underdeck tonnage.
Where is the original of Rosa, Bonheur’s
‘‘The Horse Fair”? What is it worth
to-day? Have her pictures declined in value?
What mould be the value of a copy of “The
Horse Fair”? —4636.
It is in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York. In 1887 when it was sold to the
museum the price paid was 53,700 dollars.
In 1883 Rosa Bonheur’s “Labourages Niver-
naiS” brought 4200gn5.; in 1929 it sold for
46gns, Others of hers, have suffered com-
mensurately and there is little . doubt that,
“The Horse Fair” would do likewise. A
copy would have no market value.
(1) Is the possession of a nomination by
a, State Government service essential for en-
rolment in the Australian Forestry School
diploma coarse? (2) How long does the
course last? (3), On what conditions is
diploma awarded to students? —46s4.
(1) No. (2) Three years, the first two of
which are, spent at the school, and the third
in one of the forestry sendees of the Com-
monwealth. (3) (a) Successful completion
of theoretical course. (b) Satisfactory field
work during the course. (c) One year’s
satisfactory practical forestry work following
the school course.
What is the least I can run a model A
Ford car for? I will' average about 200
miles per week. What should I allow for
depreciation and repairs? —4s7l.
The cost of running any car depends upon
the driver and its mechanical condition.
Depreciation write-off on a new ear is one-
third for the first 12 months and one-fourth
of the balance for each succeeding year. Here
are approximate figures which should assist
you. assuming that the car is new, and that
10,000 miles each year will be covered:
Fuel and tyres, £64; repairs, £10; insur-
ance and registration, £l3 10s. Total run-
ning cost p.a., £B7 10s. Depreciation on
the car for three years is estimated at £412,
and its value at the end of that period at
£B6.
What was the history of Pigott the forger?
—4681.
Richard Pigott was a journalist who sup-
plied the London “Times” with forged docu-
ments, which were guilelessly used as the
basis of the articles on “Parnellism and
Crime” in 1887. The Parnell Committee
was appointed to investigate the matter, and
the forgeries were exposed. Pigott fled to
Madrid, where he. shot himself to escape
arrest.
How is the glass in stained-glass windows
colored. —4445.
By applications of metallic oxides which
are soluble in the fused glass. The basic
materials, sand, limestone and soda, are
mixed in a proportion of 30 parts liine and
40 parts soda to every 100 parts of sand,
and are fused in a glass furnace. Coloring
matter is added at different stages. The
blties in all shades, light and dark, and from
purple to greenish, are made from the addi-
tion of different proportions of cobalt. Pea-
cock-blue is made from copper, and the best
greens from manganese. Beautiful violets
come from manganese and weak cobalt, and
dull-greens are made from an addition of
ferrous oxide. Ruby glass gets its beauty
from a proportion of gold used, and other
reds are made with manganese and copper.
The yellows are the result of the application
of oxide of silver to the surface of the glass
and oxide of lead makes a different yellow.
Orange is.from oxide of iron, and the beauti-
ful sparkling yellow from bsesquioxide of
uranium.
Preparatory to repglishing sonic silky oak
furniture I am engaged on removing the old
polish, which is very sticky and greasy. I
am using raw methylated spirit, but it is a
heartbreaking job. What is the cause of
the stickiness, and what can I do to quickly
remove the old polish?—4s42.
You are using the best means of removing
the polish. The furniture has evidently been
in use for a long time and the polish,has gone
very hard. It should be repeatedly soaked
to keep the successive stages of softening,
which does take place, in such a condition
that the coating can be removed before the
spirit evaporates, permitting the shellac to
reharden. A scrubbing brush will assist in
the operation.
What is the value of legal tender in Aus-
tralia? —4620.
An estimate made about the middle of
1931 was as follows: Australian note issue,
held by banks £23,351,000, held by public
£25,302,000; notes of trading banks out-
standing, £198,000; gold coin held by banks,
£312.000; silver coin held by banks,
£2,02(5,000; silver coin held by public,
£5 031,000; bronze coin held by banks,
£133,000; bronze coin held by public, £300.000
Total, £58,053,000.
Jim Rcsslyn (who has been in the U.S.A.
about three years ) says he came from Mel-
bourne, and was once an Australian cham-
pion wrestler. Is that so, and has he any
record ? —4575.
Resslyn was born in Melbourne about 37
years ago, and won the amateur heavyweight
championship of Victoria in 1923. After he
became a professional he beat Peter Fatouris
and Luis Pergantas in Melbourne, and won
some first-class matches in America.
(1) Did Napoleon send Nicholas Baudin
to annex Australia? (2) What arc the facts
about the French attempt to annex Tas-
mania? —4393.
(1) No; Baudin’s expedition was scienti-
fic in its purpose and Napoleon had noth-
ing to do with its promotion. (2) After
Baudin’s departure on November 18, 1802,
a rumor came to Governor King that the
expedition intended to annex territory in
Tasmania. King sent the Cumberland in
pursuit; acting-Lieut. Robbins, who was in
command, finding the French at King
Island, landed a party and ran up the. British
flag. Baudin, in a letter to King, denied
that he had had any acquisitive purpose in
view.
Information about Teniers and Mieris,
who painted scenes from Dutch life. Value
of their works? —4sl2.
There were three Teniers, Abraham,
David, senior, and David, .junior. The
last was the most capable and celebrated.
Born in 1610, died 1694. He is represented
in every gallery of Europe, big and little.
Apart from a few religious pictures he
painted almost entirely scenes from middle-
and low-class Dutch life. Lately there have
been no sales by which the value of his
work could be gauged, but in the past they
fetched good prices. Mieris was born 1635,
died 1681. He painted many portraits as
well as genre pictures. His work has fetched
high prices also. Good pictures by either
of these men should in the future be very
valuable.
(1) On the Sundry Shows Page (B.
15/2/’32) it is stated that Beethoven on his
deathbed “bequeathed Schubert his mantle.”
What were the circumstances? (2) What
was Beethoven’s opinion of Schubert? (3)
And Schubert’s of Beethoven? (4) Was
Schubert a great pianist? (5) How many
compositions did he write? —44oo.
(1) Schubert called upon Beethoven when
the latter was in bod, dying. It was their
second and, save for one other occasion,
their last meeting. A musician named
Anselm Huttenbrenner introduced them. In
the course of conversation Beethoven said
“You, Anselm, have my mind ( Geist ), but
Franz has my soul (Socle).” (2) He did
not see, any of Schubert’s w’ork till very
near the end of his life. It is recorded that
he “pored over the music for days,” asked
for more, and exclaimed, “Truly, he has the
divine fire in him.” (3) In his youth Schu-
bert was repelled by much that he could not
understand in Beethoven’s music, condemning
it as “bizarrerie.” Later he dedicated a set
of variations to Beethoven as “his admirer
and worshipper.” At the outset of his last
illness he heard a performance of Beethoven’s
“Quartet in C Sharp Minor” and, says a
friend, “got into such a state of enthusiasm
and excitement that we were all afraid for
him.” (4) He was not a virtuoso by any
means, but his playing was beautifully ex-
pressive and he accompanied songs well. His
fingers were very short and there were pas-
sages in his owfi music he could not play.
Once, attempting a florid passage in one of
the sonatas, and failing badly, he threw .the
music to the other end of the room, declar-
ing that “the devil himself couldn't play
such crabbed stuff!” (5) Like Mozart he
composed and wrote music as rapidly and as
fluently as most people write an unimportant
message. Frequently he turned out half a
dozen pieces in a day-six of his finest songs
were written in a single morning—and his
inspiration never flagged. A catalogue of his
works published in 1898 contains 1131
entries, but is by no means complete.
Does Anybody Know?
How French’s Forest, Sydney, got its
name? —4732.
I understand that Michael Flurscheim,
author of “Rent, Interest and Wages” and
“The Economic Labyrinth,” was in Aus-
tralia, or , M.L. 40 years ago. Anything
knowir about his' -mission or business acti-
vities out here ? —4802.

MEN AMONG
PEARLS
by
H. Drake -Brockman
, CHAPTER XXII.
Spring Tide.
THE weeks passed: the municipal elec-
tions came and went. Captain Goer
won by a dozen votes. The oppo-
sition declared the result a scandal, a
disaster, but the Captain’s supporters
Waxed hilarious; and Goer, who, how-
ever much he might say “Take it or
leave it,” intensely disliked open un-
popularity, experienced a glow of com-
placency. Rumor said somebody had
found a really good pearl; and somebody
inspired the Returned Soldiers’ League to
send round a petition for everyone to sign,
begging the Government to take steps to
suppress the dummying of luggers—the
practice whereby a white man lent his name
(at a price) to a colored man, who was
not allowed, by law, to hold a pearling
license. Then somebody else hawked a
counter-petition, demanding that no such
steps be taken, because what the pearlers
really wanted was to be left alone and not
have their industry interfered with: Mr.
Montgomery chuckled for hours after he
had cast the second canvasser from his
door with aspersions—he had carefully
noted, for future entertainment, the names
of a number of men who had signed both.
In the end neither document even left
Broome.
The weeks passed, and the months; and
June Goer became engaged to Peter For-
dyce. That astonished nobody, for Peter
had been haunting the Goer bungalow ever
since June’s return from Melbourne; but
the news that the young people were to be
married the following week, and meant to
go rip to Java for their honeymoon, elec-
trified the town. Next week! Why June
would have no time to get a trousseau, or
a’ proper wedding-dress, not even by the
'plane. Mrs. Tweedie considered such haste
well-nigh indecent, especially when she
leamt that June insisted upon the smallest
of functions: there was not to be one
invited guest—only the Captain and Mr.
Montgomery as witnesses and (she sup-
posed June would have to concede that
much) Mrs. Fordyce. Even the hour of
the ceremony remained shrouded in mystery
—depending upon when the Singapore boat
came in, they said. As though that
mattered!
But Mrs. Tweedie’s wounded pride gained
considerable assuagement from a letter her
husband received by air-mail the very day
before the boat was expected. The con-
tents threw her into a ferment; she bubbled
with gratification. This was the kind of
happening which repaid her for sacrificed
ambitions: there were, occasionally, times
when her position as wife of the Govern-
ment Resident made up for a great deal,
when she had the satisfaction of showing
the other women that she was of some im-
portance in spheres other than the circum-
scribed circle of their own small-town
society. She turned to overhauling her
wardrobe with anxiety.
The gratifying letter instructed Tweedie
1o meet the boat, and entertain, during
their stay in port, Lord and Lady Atten-
borough, who had been touring Australia
—he had some slight mission in connection
with immigration—and were now returning
to England by way of the north-west coast
and Singapore.
Mrs. Tweedie, feverishly sewing, re-
hearsed future conversations: “Yes. my
dear, they were charming—the Atten-
boroughs, you know. Yes, they were my
guests—he was too flattering for words”
Her husband broke in upon these rosy
anticipations by suggesting that he ring up
Contain Goer and find out what he was pre-
pared to do. He made a good showman,
Goer.
In her annoyance at this suggestion, Mrs.
Tweedie lost her scissors and had to waste
considerable time looking for them. “You
really are exasperating, Alfred,” she
declared. “Where are those wretched
scissors? Surely there is no occasion for
anybody but ourselves to look after them.
It is our duty—there are your instructions.
No, Alfred, this is entirely our own affair.”
“Goer is Mavor, you know.”
“Mayor!” The scorn of Mrs. Tweedie’s
voice left no room - for doubt as to who
was the first lady in Broome. “Well, we
can ask the Goers to dinner.... No, too
expensive; and besides, he is apt to be very
loud. Supper-will do—the boat is certain
to go out on the night tide. I’m sure dear
Lady Attenborough must be weary of func-
tions. Just a nice quiet little dinner with
us, to begin with.” Mrs. Tweedie felt she
possessed the chance of a life-time to be
really exclusive. If the rest of Broome
wanted to meet the Attenboroughs, Jet it
go down to the boat! But she did wish
she knew more about the distinguished
visitors—it was very trying to have to
admit ignorance of the aristocracy, even to
herself, now that two members of the sacred
upper circle were within reach. She dis-
covered her scissors, and at the same
moment .remembered an affair which had all
but slipped her memory.
“The Goers will not be able to come at
all,” she announced, well-pleased. : “Have
you forgotten that June is to be man’ied
to-morrow?”
While Mrs. Tweedie thus planned and
schemed, Air. Montgomery sat on hjs little
verandah up at the Buccaneer Arms. A
passing car caught his attention. Fordyce’s.
From her place at Peter’s side, June turned
to wave. Monty waved back, and went on
slowly filling his pipe. He’was very glad
June had decided to marry Peter. They
would be able to make a success of life—
as long as June refrained from thinking
any more about that other fellow.
June was trying hard not to think at all;
she was endeavoring to live, as once she
had, in a world wherein she took every-
thing at face value. So long as she was
with Peter, she managed quite well. She
had at last discovered the meaning of the
strange frightening message his fingers trans-
mitted—the oldest message in the world.
Fordyce had waited a long time before
he again asked June to be his wife—he
meant to bide his opportunity. But it had
not come readily. There should -be no
callow bungling this time, lie determined.
And June, although she appeared glad
enough to see him-—even quite eager to be
friends—remained cold, listless, difficult to
approach.
Peter made no attempt to be personal.
But he was at last rewarded by . finding
her alone one evening. Goer had gone out
to play bridge; June was reading when
Peter rapped at the lattice-door of the
verandah and came in.
“Come for a drive?” he asked.
The girl tossed aside her book and rose.
She looked tired, he thought. She was
weary, she knew—wearied by thoughts too
drab for youth to endure, by pictures'she
could not banish—of Chris; Chris slovenly,
wretched, serving drinks to colored men.
She fetched a green shawl, wrapped it about
her shoulders, and, without a word, walked
down the shingle path, under the chequered
light of the moon playing through poin-
ciana leaves, to Peter’s car.
They, motored through the pindan to
Entrance Point.'' June ruined her satin
slippers scrambling over the rocks to reach
the sea; out*she was laughing by the time
they got there. Peter could always make
her laugh:' that was why she liked to be
with him; almost did she feel in his com-
pany as she ached to feel again, as though
life were 'worth living.
Peter kept his hands in his pockets, so
as not to touch her. He grew silent, for a
moment terrified that he might again fail
—she looked so intangible, standing there
in the moonlight in her shawl the color of
night.
She startled him by asking abruptly if
he thought anybody in the world was ever
really happy. ,
In a second he was crying yes—how could
she doubt it? He could show her—had she
forgotten what he had written to her so
long ago?
June looked at him, made mysterious by
the dim light, the breeze ruffling his hair:
he could be so nice he was a dear.
But Queenie’s words still seared her
memory. She .wondered; with a tiny spurt
of her old eagerness, if indeed Peter were
just like the rest.
“What about the barmaids, Peter?” she
asked, wistfully.
For a bitter second Peter cursed Goer.
He longed to lie. But he could not; June’s
blue eyes were too direct, too - ingenuous
for him to deceive.
She went on murmuring something about
other men. He denied nothing; he merely
lifted her hands to his lips and kissed them,
very much a .gallant Fordyce. “I had not
dreamt'of you then,” was all he said.
“Then you have”—— . The wandering
breeze whisked the shawl from June’s
shoulders and trailed her question into the
night.
“Broome is scarcely a nursery for saints,
dear,” said Peter Very gently. “And regrets
never lead anywhere. June! June! Say
you will marry me;l”‘ -
She sighed. He
still held her hands.
She looked up into
his grey eyes, so
like his mother’s.
He was a dear:
and Chris—the un-
completed com-
parison brought
tears to, her eyes.
Peter saw them
glisten.
“I don’t, know,”
she murmured.
Abruptly the
girl felt her hands
dropped; strong
arms were about her waist, lips hot on
her own, almost brutally rough. She
shivered, terrified; yet she found no power
of resistance. She lay slack with fear
beneath the first passionate kisses of her life.
What was this? Had Peter gone mad?
Peter? Could this man with his demanding
grasp, his blazing eyes, his knee pressing
intimately against hers, be Peter? In the
heat of his embrace, terror sent her cold.
As rudely was she thrust from him. She
heard a voice, queer, shaken, like no other
voice she had ever listened to, demanding:
“Now do you know?”
Then was she entrapped by an extraordi-
nary sensation, more powerful even than
fear. Like a warm wave it came, washing
from head to foot, irresistible, melting
frozen terror to a strange, trembling, shy
desire to feel again the pressure of Peter’s
lips. Her mind lay stunned now by realis-
ation that the touch of him could set her
body quivering like a mangrove-tree- caught
in the rush of the spring tide.
But her aims discovered a will of their
own, and crept up the sleeves of his white
coat to his neck.
CHAPTER XXIII.
Wedding Day.
June did not see Christopher Kent again
after' that chance meeting in the street.
But she could not help thinking of him as
she dressed for her wedding. Her wedding
—she-had expected it to be a froth of lace
and tulle and delirious excitement, a solemn
gracious ceremony in some' southern cathed-
ral, scented with flowers, lit by the mystic
light of the stained-glass window; and now
here she was donning, in spite of her father’s
protests, a white voile , frock she had worn
in Melbourne and a shady hat of fine straw,
which the Captain had once declared cost
an absurd sum. But Peter would not mind
what she wore; and June, still tormented
by doubt whenever her lover was. absent,
had, after a,first tremor of hesitation, capit-
ulated to his ardent wooing: if Peter
washed, they would be married at once.
They went almost immediately after the
night at Entrance Point to see his mother;
June nervous lest Sophie Fordyce should
not welcome the girl who was taking her
son from her. But Mrs. Fordyce avas very
gentle : she, knew more than June imagined,
even though that knowledge was rather less
than she herself thought, having no inkling
of the girl’s feelings towards Kent. But
she had loi gotten neither her own sad
youth, nor the sight of June’s wistful face
asleep on a wet and. crumpled pillow. II
the old lady missed the radiance of first
love, of love just discovered,- she did not
allow it to worry her; Peter was so happy
it hurt to watch him, and he looked so
like his father, except for the grey eyes,
that she knew June would be safe in his
hands: the Fordyce men made good lovers.
June was a sweet child—like her mother
thank heaven not like Goer! She would
come back from her honeymoon radiant as
Peter. She knew: had not she herself, like
this girl, once been afraid?
Uncle Monty was very funny about the
engagement—accused Peter of stealing June
from him, teasing until Fordyce grew quite
annoyed. But he hacl whispered into June’s
ear as he kissed her: “You’ve made me
very happy. No whipping the cat now, my
child; it’s up to you.”
And yet, dressing for her marriage, June
fell into a panic. A lump kept rising in
her throat. Blindly she fumbled with her
clothes; her vision turned inwards towards
a slouching, hopeless figure. She must for-
get—she had been eager to help, but he
had given her no opportunity Should
she have made one? For a moment the
world rocked; she accused herself of taking
the easiest path—she should not be marry-
ing Peter; she should still be trying to
save Chris from himself. Ridiculous!
Girls didn’t save men. And it was not easy
to marry Peter:.... Oh, was she right or
wrong?
Her father’s voice 1 crying the time sent
her trembling to the dressing-table. She
bit her lip and began to settle her hat with
care.
Very stiil she sat driving to the church
with her father. The familiar, streets looked
strange; the warm bright- air felt like the
breath of a new country. June could see
the steamer she was soon to board with
Peter lying high and diy at the end of the
jetty. The car swung past the Residency.
Goer noted two taxis outside the gates. He
did not at all approve of this hole-and-corner,
dull way of getting married; but June had
displayed the most remarkable obstinacy
had even insisted upon keeping the time
dark, upon choosing this outlandish hour
of six o’clock.
“I see Tweedie’s got'.a crowd off the boat
at the Residency,” he commented, annoyed
by his daughter’s elusiveness. “I heard
■down-town it' is soihe bigwig or other.
It’s only this crazy idea of yours for a
quiet jedding which prevented me from
going, or from asking them to a decent
shivoo.”
“I’m sorry, Dad,” replied June very
low. Her breath was hurrying, her knees
trembling: she wanted to turn back, to'tell
Peter she simply couldn’t.
Perhaps it was well that a vague fear of
her father’s tongue spurred her to get out
of the car, to walk steadily up the grayei
path to the flight of wooden steps leading
up into the tinv church.
Mr. Montgomery sat up in front with
Peter. The clergyman, in his robes, stood
talking to Mrs. Fordyce. As June came
in with her father, he hurried up the aisle,
and started rustling through a prayer book
in search of the marriage service. In
silence they followed. Only their foot-
steps made echo; and the shiny leaves ,of
oleanders, peeping in through the wide-open
shutters at the sides of the building,
whispered as though with astonishment.,
Goer felt June’s hand shaking on his arm.
What was the matter with the girl? Anything
less like a bride he had never seen. But,
then, he hadn’t pretended to understand her
ever since—since she came back from Mel-
bourne. She ought to be pleased enough;
Peter was all right, and looked like being
a wealthy man some day.
He came now to meet them. June with-
drew her hand from her father’s arm, and
stepped towards him, so that Goer was
obliged to fall behind with Monty.
The girl, dazed with fear, glanced towards
Peter. He smilepl at her; and over her
rushed a glow of reassurance. Peter’s smite
filled her world, thrust aside fear and re-
gret, made her utter an unconscious prayer
not to fail him!
Goer stood behind his daughter, fretting
at the simplicity of the whole affair. Mr.
Montgomery silently called himself a sen-
timental old fool, but he was disappointed-
he did like to see a bride in a veil, and
June would have looked lovely! But the
bridegroom beheld only the bride’s face,
the blue eyes from which fear had vanished
at touch of his hand. His . heart pounded
at the clutch of cold fingers, trustful, beg-
ging for comfort.
One or two people drifted in before the
short service had finished. The sight- of
Goer’s car and Peter’s standing together
outride the church furnished evidence
enough of what went forward. June had
to meet them in the porch afterwards, shake
hands and smiled ; but she no longer minded
—she blushed as rosily as any satin-clad
bride, and laughed shyly when they called
her “Mrs. Fordyce.” Peter’s hand was at
her waist. Peter stood by her side. She
could not think when she was with Peter,
she could but feel. He knew how to make
her believe that life was worth living. He
was like Uncle Monty: he would never
give in.
CHAPTER XXIV.
Up Sheba-lane.
The iron roofs of old ramshackle stores,
leaning against each other for support, drone
silver in the light of a full moon; but Sheba-
lane lay dark with shadow. Here and
there a dim ray slanted from some hall-
open door, making a slit of gold on the
earthen path; at the far end, beyond the
sinister blackness of the lane, at the top of
its rising slope, beckoned the bright and
cheerful lights of the Sun Hotel. The
rattling fronds of one or two date-palms,
rooted in tiny yards behind the buildings,
and, springing from the midst of the white
roofs, peopled the night with eerie sound;
the smell oi strange foods, the indescrib-
able, unforgettable smell of the Orient, took
refuge in the lane, disguised the fresh;earth}
tang of Australian night.
No one in Broome knew how that alley-
way of Chinatown came by its glamorous
name. What went on behind those lattices,
those shutters, those tiny balconies inscrut-
able as the faces of the brown and yellow
men they sheltered? The pungent smell oi
sandalwood drifted sharply across the less
distinctive odors of foods. A shuffling figure
sidled down the lane; the click of wooden
sandals challenged the rustling of the
palms; a door opened; a torrent of abuse
oi’ \v6lcoiTi6? —for a. moment shattered the
silence. . /
But presently the glaring lights of a
motor-car lit Sheba-lane from end to end,
defying mystery, and European accents
calmly and dispassionately dispelled the
glamOTfender black figure detached itself
from the car, quickly and lightly climbed
a flight of steps leading steeply into Quan
Sing’s store. After it panted Mrs. Tweedie.
flustered, agitatedly gathering together
scarves and fluttering tails of dress which
hampered the progress they were supposed
to grace.
Mrs. Tweedie had certainly not expected
Lady Attenborough to be so young—she
could not yet be thirty—so filled with
energy, so determined to see everything,
even insisting upon this absurd excursion
away from the Residency and cool comfort
into the dark shadows of Chinatown, in
search of long-soup. It had really been
most ill-advised of Alfred to mention the
way the pearlers patronised the Chinese
ehop-suev shops after Saturday-night pic-
tures! Not as if there was anything m
long-soup —-only an uninteresting mess w
her opinion, served in very second-rate
shops!” Having been shown all round the
town and the shell-sheds and motored ou
to Cable Beach in the afternoon, the visi-
tors might really have been expected to

appreciate .the excellent-supper she had pre-
pared—not want to'come, poking round in
odorous, Chinese shops where' she herself
would never dream of coming. This sort
of thing was all very well for shell-openers
and stupid young people—but for Lord and
Lady Attenborough!
And then, too, Mrs. Tweedie .'had been
considerably put out to learn that Chris-
topher -Kent was Lady Attenborough’s
cousin: she had asked if the Tweedies knew
him. The confusion of that moment-had
not yet completely faded. Of course Mrs.
Tweedie now realised she should have lied,
should have said Kent was outside on one
of the boats; but she had been too taken
aback, So that Alfred had been obliged to
despatch a native with a message request-
ing Kent to come up to the Residency;
and the, wretched boy had returned with the
information that “that-feller Chris too-
much drunk-feller.” By great good fortune
Alfred had forestalled the boy in the
garden; thus he had been able to tell Lady
Attenborough he was very sorry, but Mr.
Kent could not be found. Lady Atten-
borough had replied: “Oh, it doesn’t matter.
I should have let him know we were com-
ing through Broome, but I have not heard
from him for more than a year; I thought
he might n 0! longer be here. But you won’t
forget to tell him, will you, that I in-
quired?” After that Lady Attenborough
had said nothing for a long time. Mrs.
Tweedie had noticed her preoccupation,
and had marshalled all her conversational
forces, in panic lest her guest should be
bored. In desperation she had remarked on
the beautiful pearls Lady Attenborough
wore. At which the young woman had
given a start, had run the jewels through
her fingers and made some statement about
being fond of pearls and that she had once
hoped her cousin would find them for her.
Mrs. Tweedie remembered smiling; she
had said she was sure her ladyship would
be astonished to hear it was a treat to see
such a rope as hers—one didn’t see pearls
in Broome—at least not many; the pearlers
were all very mysterious about their finds,
:ind of course the gems were soon sent off
to London and Paris. And then Lady
Attenborough had asked whether she knew
if Christopher Kent had ever found any,
and if he was doing well. Whereupon Mrs.
Tweedie had fallen into confusion again and
tactfully changed the subject to the ever-
ready disabilities of nor’-west life.
And now ? here she was following the slim
and elegant figure of her guest into Quan
Sing’s, with Alfred and his lordship—she
was not quite sure how to address him—
coming up behind. (This little visit would
cost a pretty sum in taxi-hire! There was.
really no decent dignity left in these days
of parsimonious Governments—being the
King’s representative was but hollow glory
without an entertainment allowance....
This little affair would mean going without
something or other Perhaps, after all,
it would hove been more satisfactory if
they had asked Goer, with his big car!)
Quan Sing himself met them in the store,
with its shelves of tinned foods, its bolts
of cotton goods, and ushered the party
dowm more steps into the big kitchen
behind the store, his cane slippers smacking
the floor, pit-pat, as he shuffled along before
his customers, still bowing.
In the kitchen four small tables covered
with wfflite cloths held each a centrepiece
of sauce-bottles, naked and unashamed of
their glaring labels. Tweedie seated his
guests at one which boasted the added im-
portance of an enormous cruet from which
the plating had long been worn.
Lady Attenborough threw open the black
satin coat she had held wrapped, round her
figure as she walked, and glanced about.
She sat facing the doorway through which
they had entered; at her back, across the
room, was a great- stove with.a wood fire
glowing red. Exotic foods hung from the
rafters, dried fish, fins, pearl-oysters; an
Oriental screen hid a door leading away
into Quan Sing’s private dwelling. A second
Chinaman, fat and smiling as Quan Sing
himself, but with a white apron flapping
down to his ankles, was stirring three huge
pots, cauldrons, on the stove; an unusual
savory odor filled the room, which, on a
hot night, must have been insufferable.
Two young men were seated at one of
the four tables.- They looked up curiously
as Tvveedie’s party entered, and Mrs.
Tweedie acknowledged their slightly self-
conscious greetings with a gracious bow.
A few moments later the youths were joined
by a third, who had with him a young
woman at whom Mrs. Tweedie in her turn
glanced curiously ; she had no doubt this
w'as the very fast barmaid she. had heard
about—peroxide hair, plucked eyebrows
and the unpleasant, aggressively-prominent
sort of bosom (Mrs. Tweedie even in her
thoughts shied from a simpler, more natural
term) which made other women uncomfort-
ably aware of their own. The girl looked
startling, certainly; but.she must have been
amusing, because a great deal of suppressed
tittering came from her companions.
A wave of annoyance swept over Mrs.
Tweedie because she had returned the salu-
tation of two of the young men—what
would Lady Attenborough think! And it
was quite impossible to explain now how
very mixed, everything became in Broome—
how difficult to discriminate where every-
thing happened, as. it were, right under one’s
nose. Fortunately foi- Mrs. Tweedie’s peace
o mind it never occurred to her that to

of no- move - account, and rather less - in-!
.terestj . than . the peroxide lady with the
voluminous breasts.
. A thin.little waiter brought soup, a.steam-
ing mess in coarse white china bowls decor-
ated with blue dragons or elegant blue
bamboos.
"“flow’d, you. eat the, stuff?” demanded
Attenborough, staring at the long ribbons
of Chinese macaroni— nun— the floating
chicken-meat, the grated egg-yolk,
- ,“Ah!” said Tweedie, and called to Quan
Sing. “Suppose you show Lord Atten-
borough proper-feller way?”
As the title rolled richly from Tweedie s
tongue, the customers at the other table
were silent for a second, then fell to talk-
mg with redoubled energy, and with a
studied carelessness denied by eyes stealing
furtive glances at the strangers,
Q«an seized a pair of chopsticks and
called for a bow of soup which in five
seconds had al! but vanished I resent l.y
the visitors were struggling helplessly with
refractory chopsticks and laughing at each
others struggles.
A nmse in the outside shop
caught Mis. l weedie s attention she was
alert the time, in tear ol some vision
even more distressing than’the barmaid.
Suddenly a voice cursed Quan Sing unspar- -
ingly and called for lights.
Mrs. Tweedie, in her agitation at such
language, failed to notice that Lady Atten-
borough laid down her chopsticks and sat
very straight, a tense; and listening expres-
sion straining her fine features; she whis-
pered to Tweedie that she really thought
they should-go—one never knew what might
happen doivn here.
A man appeared in the arched doorway.
He stood looking down into the brightly-
lit. kitchen, steadying himself against the
wall; and it was the peroxide lady who
greeted him.
“Hullo, Chris!” she called.
Kent stood very still. In - his fuddled
mind thought took shape that he must this
time have over-stepped the limit; a voice
had called his name, a common voice, not
in the least like Lettice’s; yet there sat
Lettice staring at him, her lip caught by
her teeth, in front of her one of old Quan
Sing’s long-soup bowls. He burst into
cackling laughter. Good God! Imagine
thinking he saw Lettice in old Sing’s!
(To be concluded next wcclc. )
Lost.
The battle is lost - , and the winds go over,
Attuned to my ear through the swaying
trees,
As I lie face-down in the scented clover
That opens her arms to the courting bees.
And I lie me here with my senses sodden,
And numbed with defeat, ’neath the open
skies.
But what would, I care th'a't I’m under-
trodden,
If I hadn’t that aching behind my eyes?
They think T am dead! But the wind is
singing
An anthem of sleep to the list’ning grass.
With poppies about me their censers
swinging,
And drowsy’s the hunt of the bees that
pass.
Oh! what would I care that defeat has
spoken,
That purpose has failed, that I’ve lost the
prize,
And what would I care that I’m crushed and
broken,
If I hadn’t that aching behind my eyes?

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Metallurgy's win in the St. Kilda Handi-
cap at Caulfield last Saturday was so bril-
liant that he appears to be sure of place-
money at least in the A.J.C. St. Leger. He
was very narrowly beaten by Oratory in
the Flemington classic. Both colts failed
signally in the Australian Cup. Oratory
never has been reliable, but Metallurgy's
inability to get near the leaders until the
race was practically over puzzled punters
exceedingly. IT. King, owner-trainer of
Metallurgy, decided that H. Moran, the little
apprentice, could do as well with the hand-
some bay as any crick jockey, and Moran
accordingly had the mount at Caulfield.
Passing the stand Metallurgy was third last
of a strung-ou,t field. At the mile and a
quarter post Moran took his mount to the
outside, and joined Calmond five furlongs
from home. The colt is addicted to hanging
in and Moran had to stop riding and pull
him off Calmond. The son of Rossendale
was running away at the finish to score by
a length and a half from Peter Jackson, with
My Talisman only half a head farther off
and Calmond fourth.
It was a great performance on the part
of Metallurgy, who ran the 1 \ miles in 2min.
34dsec., good time for Caulfield, considering
that pace was not clapped on in real earnest
until after leaving the straight. Peter Jack-
son, the half-brother to Gaine Carrington, at
last did something to justify the high repu-
tation that he brought from Maorilaud. He

is held on lease by J. A. Phillips, the pad-
dock bookmaker who paid a big sum for
Gaine Carrington. It had been the inten-
tion of Phillips to surrender the lease of
Peter Jackson, but now he may go on with
the Nigger Minstrel gelding. Shadow King
was in commission for the St. Kilda Handi-
cap, and his owners expected to collect
enough money to cover the expense of send-
ing the Comedy King horse to Sydney.
Third at the home turn, he looked a pos-
sible winner, but faded into fifth position.
Mick Poison picked up a middle-distance
race at Caulfield with Trevallion, who had
the services of J. E. Pike as jockey. For
some unaccountable reason the angular hay
drifted from 6 to 4 to twice those odds. Jack
Holt and his followers threw in heavily on
High Brae, while money also was piled on
Count Orloff, from the stable of C. T. Godby.
It was a one-liorse race throughout. Pike
took Trevallion to the front in the first
furlong, and his mount romped home three
lengths in advance of Count Orloff, with
Seaflight third, just ahead of High Brae.
The course record for S-l furlongs was re-
duced to lmin. 45sec. This also is an Aus-
tralian record, but the distance is unusual.
Holt broke a rather protracted run of ill
luck when he captured the Orrong Two-year-
old with Hall Mark (Heroic —Ilerowinkie),
who is raced by the breeder, C. B. Kellow.
Seven years ago Kellow had a colossal win
over Heroic and Pilliewinkie in the New-
market Handicap-Australian Cup double;
hence the bestowal of the name of Hero-
winkie on Hall Mark’s dam. It was by a
mere head that Hall Mark vanquished Pal-
phar, a Fernkloof colt from the stable of
E. Fisher, but W. Duncan appeared to ride
a confident finish on the winner. Nuit d’Or.
raced by Philip Russell, of the V.R.C. com-
mittee, was a good thing beaten. He was
second-last into the straight, but finished at
phenomenal speed, and was only a nose be-
hind the third horse, Centreline, who belongs
to H. Alan Currie, another V.R.C. com-
mitteeman.
Alick Fullarton, who first came into pro-
minence as a cross-country horseman by
landing the Grand National Steeplechase of
1929 on Sandhurst, won the jumping double
at Caulfield. He took the Narong Hurdle
on Cellohurst and the Gordon Steeplechase
on Baver Lad. The last-named is by the
same sire as Sandhurst. The consistent but
unlucky Harry Gavin led home the South
Yarra Handicap field. Waltzing Lily was
favorite, but shaped far below her New-
market Handicap form.
* * $ *
The easy manner in which Peter Pan
accounted for a good w.f.a. field in City Tat-
tersall’s Randwick Stakes confirms his
championship claims. Had Bartle pushed
him out over the anal furlong there is little
doubt he could have improved on his; time
which is only a quarter of a second
outside the Australian record for the mile.
Although the chestnut had not raced since
his Melbourne Gup victory, he was solidly
backed and started at 7 to 4. He waited
on the leader, Johnnie Jason, for most of
the journey, and at the distance came on to
win comfortably by a length from Rogilla
(3 to 1), who cut Lough Neagh (7 to 1)
out of second money. Peter Pan is a trifle
on the big side and should be at his top
for the A.J.C. autumn meeting. Though
beaten, Rogilla lost few friends. H'e had
none the best of the running, yet finished
remarkably well. Lough Neagh was pro-
minent throughout, but was weakening near
the finish.
Although Irish Bard (7 to 1) won the
Novice Handicap (it was his fourth
successive win), the chestnut had to
be ridden right out to stave off Bill
Wedgewood (20 to 1). who ran him to half
a head. Another long-priced one in Blair-
fort (20 to 1) was two lengths away third.
Either of the two placed horses would have
given McShortodds a good kick off for the
day, as they went out practically unbacked.
The favorite, Cercello, showed up at the
lialf-mile, but dropped back at the turn.
Braeburn’s failure in City Tattersall’s
Cup jarred backers badly. The Queensland
Cup winner was so heavily backed that he
started at 2 to 1, his nearest associates in
the betting being at double figures. He was
well up with the leaders when turning into
the straight, but faded into third place. The
race went to Mr. Kerry (10 to 1), who
came with a late run to score by a length
and a half from Miss Nottava (12 to 1).
The winner had not raced since January,
but he slid over the mile and three furlongs
in 2min. ISsec., eoualling the course record.
Veilantif won the Youthful Stakes so
easily that it would seem the Moabite filly
was unlucky to get beaten into second place
at Moorefield on the previous Saturday. Air
Queen was the backers’ elect. Six to one
was on offer, but the filly quickly dropped
to 7to 2. She appeared to have every
chance, but was no nearer than fifth at the
finish. The winner, going out at the handy
price of 9 to 1, outpaced her field from the
start and won by three lengths from High
(10 to 1). Wexford (20 to 1) finished
third. He started from the extreme outside
and put up a sterling performance.
Legislator was hailed as a good thing for
the Denham Stakes. Why, is hard to say,
as the gelding had not raced in public for
some time. He started favorite at 2. to 1,
but could not do better than an.indifferent
third. The winner, Lucre (7 to 1). took
charge at the Leger and, although it looked
as if the fast-finishing Whittingham might
catch her, scrambled home by three-quarters
of a length.
This Page picked Cynical to win the Club
Welter and he finished in a determined
manner to beat Camargo by a length. He
was backed from 5 to 1 to 2 to 1 in the
early stages, but eased to 4 to 1 before the
start. The consistent Havaspot (10 to 1)
was a length further back third.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Short-cut wins were the rule at Sydney
Stadium’s popular-priced show on Saturday
night, the chief contest between Bobby
Fraser (9st. 9flb.) and Jimmy Day (9st.
Sflb.) ending in round four, when Fraser’s
right uppercut upset Day for the full count.
Dal Costa (Bst. 3Jlb.) tackled Kid George
(Bst. in the other 10-rounder. George
displayed great gameness until the sixth
started, but a short open-handed right that
then outed him did not seem hard enough
to knock an egg off his head, if one had been
balanced there'.
Si! * # *
North Sydney Stadium again staged the
most important programme in the metropolis
tan area last week-end, when two former
champions of Australia furnished the fights.
Russ Critclier (lOst. 51b.), who once ruled
our welterweight roost, knew too much for
Keith Hall (lOst. lib.), who was knocked
out in five rounds. Ex-champion bantam-
weight Billy McAlister (Bst. 61b.) out-
pointed Kid Cameron (Bst. lib.) in the other
main event.
Tom Lurich was to have banged about
with Bonny Muir in a match for the Aus-'
tralian heavyweight wrestling championship
at Leichhardt last Saturday, but the Rus-
sian’s leg was fractured at Newcastle five
nights before, so King Elliott met Muir _in
his stead. The substituted _ brawl, which
went better than the original promised,
ended in a draw. Elliott made matters even
with a flying-tackle and body-press in the
sixth, after Muir’s short-arm-scissors had
scored a fall in the fourth.
Ins and Outs
“Tenth Slip”: The tour of the English
cricket side just completed closely resembles
that of the last under Chapman, in that it
lost only one match on the tour, and that
a Test. Chapman’s side drew 13 games, and
Jardi ue’s 10, with one tie. Sutcliffe headed
the batting averages for all matches with
66.09. but was the shadow of the chap who
played for Chapman, and the same can be
said of Hammond. Pataudi disappointed,
though he averaged 53.31 on the tour, He is
not yet a Ranji or even a Duleepsinhji. Lar-
wood, a much-improved bowler, especially as
regards stamina, took 64 wickets for 13.89
each. Allen, bowling without leg theory,
was a great success. The bowling dis-
appointment of tlic tour was Bowes, who,
while he took 38 wickets, made one wonder
whence came his English reputation.
“Fitzcray”: Melbourne Cricket Ground
trust, which likes to think itself as con-
servative as the institution in St. John’s
Wood, London, with the same initials,
nearly fainted the other day when R. Linton,
a member of the board, resigned, the first
to do so in the trust’s history. Linton is
off to England as Victorian Agent-General
for some years and as the trust is to make
extensive alterations to the ground he con-
sidered a man on the spot should take his
place. There was self-sacrifice in the ges-
ture, too, for a trusteeship carries with it
automatic membership of the famous club
at Lord’s.
* Jfc 5r ♦
“Lancaster Park”: One of the several
Maoiiland cricketers of note seduced away
to professional cricket in England of late
is G. S. Dempster, as good a bat as there
is playing cricket anywhere to-day. He L
in England now with the Blackpool
League club. But he wants to do so as
an amateur, so a billet is being hunted
up for him. In some sports, such as Rugby
football, this would be an act of professional-
ism, as far as Dempster’s share went, and
it should be so in cricket. In the days when
English paid players were treated as
menials the man who maintained his pris-
tine purity as paid “secretary” of a county
club so that he could play with the county
as an amateur came in for a lot of vivid
criticism from the “players.”

“Shrewsbury”: Now that the Tests are
over, English cricket publicists are showing
a change of front as regards the danger of
fast bowling on the log side, which recently
they told Australians was really a figment of
their own imagination. Says the eminent
Neville Cardus, “The patriots applauding
our own bowlers to-day will sing another
tune if next summer on English wickets
they begin to lay out our local heroes like
ninepins.” This authority adds that “the
primary aim of fast leg-theory is intimida-
tion,” and with that we may leave him.

Footbrawl ,
“Fitzcray”: At one time it looked as if
the Australian rules football carnival in Syd-
ney next August would fall through, both
South Australia and Westralia cutting up
rough. Westralia demanded £lOOO towards ex
nenses to send a team. South Australia theu
hopped in with a demand for help, and an-
nounced that if Westralia backed out it
would do so also. Finally, the ,West was
placated with £5OO. and South Australia is
also to receive a contribution to expenses.
The. question arises whether these carnivals
are worth while. They are very costly, and
the 1930 affair in Adelaide resulted in a loss,
as is certain to be the case in Rugby-follow-
ing Sydney. However, it looks as if all six
States will now be represented in the Bridge
City.

“Dor Jong”: The Australian Rugby Union
side which leaves for South Africa on April
25 will have little to learn about train-
travelling by the time it embarks for homo.
During the three and a half months in the
Union and Rhodesia, the team will be on
the rail most of the time, the schedule work-
ing out at 410 hours two minutes. One jour-
ney, from J’burg to Oudtshoorn in the East-
ern Cape Province, will take 40 hours, and
there are four others taking over 30. One
consolation is that the South African rail-
ways are splendidly equipped for long-dis-
tance travelling, and far excel anything seen
in Australia.
* * * *
“Gate”: N.S.W. Rugby League is deter-
mined to get its house in order this season.
Last year the form shown was very bad. and,
with the team for England to be selected on
June 17, there is no time to be lost in build-
ing up. The metropolitan clubs suffered
heavily last winter from the poaching of
the country organisations which were able
to offer employment. This year the war is
to be. carried into the enemies’ country anil
country cracks lugged to Sydney wherever
possible. Also the League is straining every
endeavor to help men in need of assistance
to stay in the metropolis with their clubs,
and the scheme which proved so efficacious
last season will be extended.

Ins and Outs
The final match of the English tour
against South Australia at Adelaide fizzled
out in a draw, and everyone was glad to see
the last of the tour, the games after the
fifth Test-being- merely in the nature of an
anti-climax. England’s second essay yielded
371 for S wickets, Leyland scoring 152.
South Australia lost 8 for 318, Nitsclike
• 87) and Tobin (52 n. 0.) trouncing the
bowling. Most of the English games with
the States and minor sides have been
“second-eleven” matches as far as the visi-
tors are concerned. On future tours it might
be as well to bring two sets of players, one
for Tests only.
* * * $
“Aigburth”: Larwood, stung by the criti-
cism his bowling methods have aroused in
Australia, has vowed he -will never return
to this country with another English team.
If he does, it will be something in the
nature of a miracle. Though only 29, the
Notts man has been playing first-class cricket
for over half a dozen seasons, and has
figured in the Test ring since 1926. That
is a long time for a fast: bowler, and, since
the next English side will not be here until
1936, Larwood will be lucky if he lasts
long enough for it. His next season in Eng-
land may be his last in Test games, against
Australia at least.
“Canny Lad” : In spite of the hard times
the takings from the English cricket tour
go a long way to make up for the wrangling
which marred it. The total takings from
the first-class matches were £lOO,OOO in
round numbers, the biggest cut, £16,284,
coining from the third Test at Adelaide. The
Melbourne game (the second, won by Aus-
tralia) would have yielded much more had
it not been confined to four days. As it
was, the hat held £16,077. The fourth Test
at Brisbane returned £9735, while Sydney’s
two fixtures produced £1.4,854 and £11,796.
In all the Tests panned out £68,696 as
against £73,877 for Chapman’s tour in 1928.
“Bramall Lane” : There is at least one
convinced bowl-at-the-man exponent left in
England. It is A. W. Carr, former captain
of an English side and to-day leading Notts,
where Larwood and Voce abide. Carr says
he intends to work the assault and battery
bowling for all he is worth in English county
cricket next season. He proclaims that he
will tell Larwood “to bowl leg-theory at the
batsman” and adds, quite unnecessarily,
that he “has no moral qualms.” A lot oi
Australians would pay handsomely for a
front seat at the next Notts-Surrey match.
Jardine goes in first, for Surrey.
Racquet and Bawl
“Top Spin”: One of the problems con-
fronting the captain and manager of the
Davis Cup team now leaving Australian
waters for Europe is the placing of the
teams. With Hopman out, the question of
a partner for Crawford in the doubles crops
up. McGrath does not shine in doubles;
Quist promises much better in this respect,
though if he is partnered with Crawford the
latter will probably have to change over to
the left court to fit in with the youngster.
Crawford and McGrath will probably be the
singles team.
* * * *
. “Top Spin”: The N.S.W. tennis authori-
ties have set the ball rolling in the direction
of inviting an English women’s tennis team
to visit Australia in return for the calls
paid in 1925 and 1928 by the Australian
girls. As the Australian championships are
down for Sydney next year, the invitation
would probably be dated to include them.
It was suggested that manager Youdale, of
the Australian Davis Cup team, should do
the negotiating while in Britain. Several of
the leading Englishwomen, including Betty
Xuthall. have declared themselves willing to
come, as well, as a party of the men players,
headed by F. Perry. The Australian Tennis
Council will have the final say in the invita-
tions, of course.
* # * #
“Lancaster Park” : M.L. tennis authorities
have been discussing the possibility of the
All Blacks figuring again in Davis Cup
contests since A. C. Stedman and E. D.
Andrews have gone to England. Both are
well known on this side. Andrews reaching
the N.S.W. championship in
1926, and winning the junior title that
year when he beat Crawford and Hopman.
Stedman was seen in action here during
the Japanese visit to Australia. Both have
been given permission by M.L. to play at
Leyton, Bombay and elsewhere on their road
to Britain.

“Amateur Pro.” : The decision of Jim Wil-
lard, Australian Davis Cup player and Olym-
pic representative, to go over to professional
tennis is not surprising; for years he has
given much of his time and experience to
i Hlg i youn £ Players for the game’s sake.
” 'dcly known and very popular, lie should
do well. Willard is the eighth player of
inter-State calibre in Australia to take to
the paid game. Others include J. O. Ander-
■son and L. Baker, 0 f N.S.W.; O’Hara Wood,

lie late C. P. St. John, of Queensland; and

the first golf championship of the Australian
Navy was played on the Rosnv links, near
Hobart, No one below wardroom rank seems
to have competed, or, if any did so, the fact
does not appear on the. cards.. Lieutenant
Wilson, of -the Australia:, won with a score'of
77. with Lieutenant Tait, of the Canberra,
second, a stroke behind. A handicap run with
the championship went to Rear-Admiral Dal-
glish with a net 08. As Was only propei-, his
flag-captain followed liis chief in second
place with a card of 69 net. No details of
the handicaps allotted these potentates have
been made public.
“Hotham”: The annual meeting of the
V ictorian Golf Association recorded that 240
clubs are now affiliated. There is a cash
balance of £267. An interesting item was
that showing the receipts from the State
amateur championship, where a “gate” was
tried for the first time. The takings were
£4l. and expenses £l6—quite a good start.
The association will this year conduct the
Australian championships, commencing on
September 4, and the State championships
from September 29 to October 5 at the

Metropolitan course. Victoria will not send
a team to compete for the Kirk-Windeyer

is handed over to the Australian Golf, Union
or some similar authorised body.
* * * *
“Divot Digger”: The decision of Dr. Reg
Bettingtou to give up competitive golf for
a time at least will come as a knock to the
game in N.S.W., especially with the Kirk-
Windeyer Cup fixture soon due in Maori-
and the Australian championships
looming. The old King's School and Oxford
all-rounder had a great run last season. He
was third in the Australian open, and won
the national amateur title, while he finished
second, with Eric Apperley, for the four-
somes. Also in the bag were the N.S.W.
amateur championship and the mixed four-
somes with Mrs. Bettingtou, while he won
his foursomes, partnered by R. J. Witliy-
edmbe, in the Kirk-Windeyer Cup, and beat
the. Maoriland champion, Rana Wagg, in
their singles match in the same fixture.

“Sandringham”; The Australasian Golf
Club opened its season on the Aspendale
course, near Melbourne, with a four-ball
best-ball match between two leading amateurs,
M. J. Ryan, Australian open and Victorian
amateur champion, and H. L. Williams,
Australian amateur champion in 1931, and
two of Victoria’s best professionals, C. Con-
ners and W. J. Fowler. The lilywhites took
a horrible hiding, Fowler and Conners win-
ning 7 up and 6. The four-ball figures were
Fowler and Conners 32, and 5,3, 4; Ryan
and Williams 37, and 5,4, 5. Approxi-
mate individual scores were: Fowler 72,
Conners 74, Williams 75, Ryan 78.
* * * *
“Brassey”: The perennial golfer who finds
he has left, his pencil in the locker-room
before starting out on his round is a curse
to himself and a nuisance to his playing
mates. Realising this, W. A. Love, of the
Goulburn (N.S.W.) club, has invented a
handy little pencil-holder which is also a
sharpener. This clips on to the player’s
card, and is almost fool-proof, as far as
anything of the sort can be. There is a
socket at one end also, and into this fits
a spare wooden tee. Size does not permit
the addition of a refreshment flask, but
otherwise the invention is full of merit.
if if if if
“Carnoustie”: This year’s British open
championship at St. Andrews promises to
be a real gathering of the clans. In addi-
tion to the usual stragglers from “the Colo-
nies” there will be at least one Indian and
a Japanese. The United States will be re-
presented in force, the invasion including
the Ryder Cup team which is to inflict the
usual walloping on the British professionals.
The South Americas will also be there —
Jose Jurado, who has figured prominently in
earlier championships, leading a team of
six Argentinos whose names read like a list
of revolutionary generals. When these
have done, with the open, they want to fix
up a match with the British professionals
on Ryder Cup lines.
“The McHaggis” : St. Andra’s Toon Coun-
cil, ye ken, that runs the famous links, has
announced that the charges for admission
to the British open championship, which
begins on July 3, will be a half-crown per
day. Canny folk may indulge their flair fox-
economy by taking a season ticket for the
whole five days of the meeting. This will
cost only ten shillings, a verra leeboral con-
cession.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: One result of Malcolm Camp-
bell’s newest speed -record is the washing out
of Daytona Beach for future trials. The
going was so rough on this last occasion
that Campbell considers he only got through
by a miracle, while a lot of speed was lost
by the fact that the car was in the air
much of the time, with the wheels running
uselessly. The great cyclone which swept
Florida last year is estimated to have spoiled
the beach for years. Interviewed on his
return to Britain. Campbell said that in his
attempt to reach 300 m.p.h.—his life’s ambi-
tion—he will probably try the Maoriland
Ninety Mile Beach, where he hopes to be
able to let his ear out to full capacity.
"Formula” : This year's Monte Carlo rally
proved a teaser for competitors, the weather
being the worst experienced in Europe fox-
years. Forty-six of the original starters had
to turn it in, some failing to reach their
starting-points. Deep snow, temperatures
down to 30deg. below zero, and frozen roads
were among the troubles struck. The most
successful group was that starting from Tall-
inn, 2386 miles from Monte. This route
carried 950 points for arrival on time, and
the two winners were from this group. The
large-car section (over 1500 c.c.) went: to
M. Vasselle, driving a Hotchkiss, and the
small-car to Roualt and Quinlin in a Salm-
son. Vasselle was the winner of the first
section last year. The fourth car in the
large-car section, which also started from
Tallinn, was Lord Clifford’s British Bentley
fitted with a Diesel-Gax-dner lieavy-oil
engine, the first of its kind to figure in such
an important event. Of the 74 cars to finish
their routes, 29 were British, and 13 of
these small cars.

“Kick Starter”: The choice of the Austra-
lian Autocyele Union of a represen ta-
tive of this country in the Isle of Man Tourist
Trophy races in June next has fallen again
on .T Pringle. r>f Victoria. He will receive
a grant of £175 from the English T. T.
management, and it is possible iliat a second
rider will be sent, in which case he will
receive half the allowance to Pringle. More
than likely Brewster*, who accompanied
Pringle last year, will be the second man.
Pringle finished 12th in last ye'ar’s senior
race. lie has had several trips to England,
and has been fairly successful there.
* * :!= *
The N.S.W. Autocycle Union, having
bagged the 1933 Australian Grand I’rix road
races, for motor-cycles for the Ma State, will
hold them on the Bathurst circuit. Within a
mile of Bathurst, the circuit is one of the
best in Australia, and has seen more than
one battle for the Grand Prix. The prize-
money lias - been increased to £125, in addi-
tion to the many trophies usually on offer,
and the races will be run on Easter Satur-
day, April 15.
Miscellaneous
“Ride Off”: Though competition polo
seems to have succumbed to the depresh
in N.S.W'., they order things better in Vic-
toria, where the annual match for the Strad-
broke Cup provided a fine week’s entertain-
ment. Melbourne Hunt A and Adelaide were
the two teams left in the final, and after a
fast and clean game Hunt A won by 5
goals to 4. The Adelaide team had the
faster ponies, and were not too well served
by the luck. Scores were even to near clos-
ing time, when R. 11. Nimmo (No. 2) broke
away from the Melbourne goal, and going
right*up the field scored the winning point.
He was the outstanding player for Hunt,
with M. ,T. Noonan the st-ar of the visitors.
“Blue Chalk”: Giving Joe Davis 6000,
Walter Landrum was defeated by the Eng-
lishman in the match under baulk-line rules
for the Gold Cup, Davis playing out time
with 24,75 S to Lindrum’s 24,007. The win
will not land Davis in the final for the
Cup, for Tom Newman and Maorilander
McCouachy top the points list. The pair
are now engaged playing off the final. For
the English professional championship, re-
vived this year, Landrum is tin; one bet. As
players start level, playing 24 sessions, lie
seems home and dried, though the 200 baulk-
line rule will be enforced. His first oppo-
nent is Newman, Davis meeting McConaehy.
“Besom”: It is curious that Australia,
exposed as it has been for years to Scots-
men, knows little of the roaring game of
curling, which, now that golf has been inter-
nationalised, remains a truly Scottish pur-
suit. The absence of ice in parts of Aus-
tralia may account for it. but in winter the
Victorian Alps _ and the N.S.W. mountain
resorts offer facilities for skating, and where
one can skate one can curl, while Sydney and
Melbourne .both have their indoor ice rinks.
In any case, a club has been formed in Mel-
bourne and Will play on the Glaciarium when
occasion offers. The principle is almost the
same as that of bowls, save that, instead of
a jack, a ringed tee is marked on the ice at
each end of the rink, and, instead of the,
wooden bowls, flattened round stones of con-
siderable weight arc propelled along the ice
by handles fixed in their upper surfaces. The
noise of the stones on the ice and the bellow-
ing of the players frantically sweeping the
Jce m front of the moving stones with
brooms make curling the most uproarious
game in existence.

Distinguished Social Lite.
The Women Pioneers’ new clubrooms
look right on to the Botanical Gardens, and
so close does the statue of Captain Phillip
appear that it might be on their own lawn,
if a lawn were possible in macquarie-street.
There is a lift that carries one up to the
flat roof with its glorious view of the harbor.
The arched drawing-room has two fire-
places, one opposite each door. Over one
there is a painting of Captain Phillip, over
the other one of Captain Cook. On the
walls are such treasured possessions as “The
Banding of Captain Phillip’’ and a huge
picture of the Sirius. The mantelpieces are
of marble, the deeply curved fireplaces tiled
—one in brown and white, the other in black
and white. This room was gay with zinnias
and roses for the club’s first party. Here
competitions and talk were the attractions,
whilst the room across the flagged passage
was filled with bridge enthusiasts. In spite
of the fact that at two o’clock president
Mrs. W. A. Lingham and secretary Carlotta
Doyle were still busy putting shades on
the lights, the two hostesses looked calm
and unruffled when a little later the first of
the guests arrived.
Sydney remembers Lady Abinger, who is
due in her native land in March, as Miss M.
McPhillamy. She’s a dnughter of Mr. J.
McPhillamy, of the well-known Bathurst
clan. Lord Abinger, before succeeding to
the title and the big Highland castle of
Inverlochy in Inverness, was on the staff
of a former Queensland Governor. When
pretty Miss McPhillamy met him he was
a popular figure in Bananaland society as
Colonel Scarlett, A.D.C. The Apple Isle
expects a visit from Lady Abinger (whose
late mother was formerly Miss E. Maxwell,
of Hobart) and her son, the Hon. Jim
Scarlett.
Everywhere you went last week you were
admonished “Be Kind to Animals.” First
we had “Humane Sunday,” when the dif-
ferent churches spoke in the interests of
our dumb friends. Chief Secretary F.
Chaffey set the ball fairly rolling on Monday,
when the formal opening of Animal Week
took place. There, was more animal talk
(principally doggy) at the Millions Club,
when - the council of the R.S.P.C.A. was
lunched; and Lady Game paid a call to
King Edward Vll.’s Dogs’ Home on Thurs-
day.
But a shop in Pitt-street was the real
magnet. With its tiny Pekinese at one door,
and a real foxy at the other, children and
grown-ups found it hard to pass without
dropping a coin into the boxes held by their
respective owners. Inside, lively dogs (black
and white and colored) gambolled on the
walls, while sales of farm and orchard pro-
duce, as well as those useful and ornamental
odds and ends usually associated with
bazaars, went briskly on.
There is to be gaiety without ceasing in
Sydney from the Ist to the Bth April—Syd-
ney’s Festival Week. In the daytime, flower-
decked floats and flower-decked motor-cars
are going to procesli through the streets. On
the night of the first there will be a floral
ball at the Wentworth, arranged by the
Younger Set of the Royal Prince Alfred
Hospital. And the same night will see “A
Beautiful Eyes Competition” at the Com-
munity Hospital’s “April Fools’ Frolic.”
Rich in pageantry will, be the Historical
Society Ball at David Jones’s on the 3rd,
and the League of Nations Ball at the Town
Hall on the sth. The ,Lud Mayor’s Ball on
the 7th promises to be a big success. But
the most brilliant of all should be the Mili-
tary Ball, which closes the season. This
will be held at David Jones’s, and is the one
event at which the women’s frocks will not
be noticed—at least, not much.
The frocking of a first-night audience at
Prince Edward’s is always notable. On
Wednesday, when the picture was “In the
Wake of the Bounty,” the new styles and
the vogue for velvet made it particularly
attractive. The new long evening coats in
velvet and satin, many of them featuring
capes bordered in fur, were frequent. Among
the most outstanding was Gretel Bullmore’s
in one of the new pastel shades of blue.
The Knox lady was all black, her chiffon
frock being covered with a black velvet coat,
but Alexander Gordon’s lady harmoniously
combined black and silver. “Giff” brought
a party in wdiich were Mrs. Fred Smith
and the Walder lady. Mrs. Dan Carroll looked
fairer than ever in black velvet. Premier
Stevens found time to follow the Bounty’s
adventurous career. The two Miss Tildes-
leys were there; so were Violet Roche, in
turquoise-blue angel-skin, playwright Harry
Tighe and Colonel and Mrs. Bruxner.
~ Among the importants of the night was
Mrs. Charles Chauvel, whose husband irre-
sponsible for the production of the him
and for the illustrated book which was
simultaneously put on the market. When
first seen in the foyer, Mrs. Chauvel
was wearing black lace. But at the end of
the screening she spoke from the stage of
the life on Pitcairn Island, and she dressed
this part in a tea-rose pink lace arid tulle
frock. This had little puff sleeves arid fitted
to the knees, and then frothed to her toes.
The weather was hot and the roads were
dusty, but the Yass picnic race meeting
was an outstanuing success. From Sydney,
from Canberra, from Gundagai, from Orange
and from Goulburn and all the surrounding
districts came guests, first to the young
people’s dance at Jeir, the home of the
P. J. Magennis couple. Here in the dahlia-
decked ballroom, Phyllis, in beige georgette,
helped her mother to receive the guests.
Races are races wherever they are held,
and a picnic luncheon has no effect on the
dressing, so the frocks were just what you
would expect to find at Randwick. Many
had been selected with an eye to the possible
bite of autumn in the air, but, being bought
for the races, they were worn at the races,
complete with their little turbans and eye-
veils. In her green linen and wide-brimmed
hat Meg Horsley looked enviably cool. Rhyl
Magennis also chose green, but in iparo-
cain; Mrs. C. W. V. Massy and daughter
jbetty wore brown linen. Mrs. A. J. Chris-
tian could be picked out of any group by
her blue and white striped sunshade, and
Mrs. E. J. Merriman cheered her husband’s
Filthy Lucre to victory in an anembpe-
pink 'flat-crepe frock and black lace scarf.
After the races there was just time for a
cocktail before changing for the ball at the
Memorial Hall. Here from the first yodel
the dancing and singing went merrily on
until 1 somewhere about breakfast-time the
next morning. Tubs of hand-made roses,
streamers and quaint lampshades decorated
the hall, and Mrs. E. J. Merriman presented
the trophies, the three firsts going to her hus-
band, the popular president of the club.
“Precious Bane,” put on by the Indepen-
dents, drew a crowded house to the Savoy
on Saturday night, and amongst those who
came to see Edward Lewis’s stage adapta-

was neither at the front of the house nor
on the stage but in the audience: attractive

Looking at you from this Bulletin photo-
graph is Barbara Tribe, tall and fair and
not yet 20, who has been awarded the
diploma in Sculpture, with honors, of the
East _ Sydney
Tech. Dur-
ing her five
years’ course
(three in
sculpture and
two in draw-
ing and de-
sign) she has
exhibited with
the Society of
Artists.- The
nude female
figure in the
Rialto Theatre,
Ryde, is one
of her works;
others include
tli e ; decora-
tive dancing
figures in the
proscenium of
the Technical
College Theat-
rette. For two
months last year she worked on the Bridge
pageant, and she is still working with Raynor
Hoff on. the Anzae War Memorial. Although
she thinks there is much to be learnt in our
own Australia, 1935 will see her trying for
the travelling scholarship of the Society of
Artists.
To-day (Wednesday) the Australian Art
Exhibition in the Macleod Gallery (Bulle-
tin Buildings) is having an anniversary;
it was a year ago that it was opened. Since
then it has been kept, going continuously,
though the pictures have been often changed:
in the present collection there are 280 oils,
water-colors, drawings and etchings, almost
every Australian' artist being represented.
During the year two special exhibitions have
been held under Victor Mann’s direction —
one of Norman. Lindsay’s water-colors; the
other the Painter-Etchers’ —and in all 180
works have been sold. Apart from Norman
Lindsay, whose exhibition was a pheno-
menal success for the times, the artist most
soUght after has been Robert Johnson. The
Gallery enters its second year holding out
the same hearty welcome to visitors; for its
chief purpose is not to sell art but to popu-
larise it.
Professor Mungo MacCallum, despite his
79 years, stepped into the breach caused by
the sudden death of Professor Le Gay Brere-
ton, and Undertook to deliver a series of ten
lectures on Shakspeare’s tragedies to second-
and third-year Uni. students. The first of
them —‘‘King Lear” —he gave last week. Pro-
fessor of English E. R. Holme and Lecturer
A. J. Waldock had proposed to take on the
late Professor’s work, but the long course
of lectures needed time to prepare.
On the same day we had the MacCallum
lady, her arm in a sling and badly shaken
from' an accident the day before, making at
Government House a heartfelt appeal for
the Infants’ Home at Ashfield. For 58
years this home has been in existence, and,
although it has been put to hard straits
on many an occasion, the public has very
seldom been asked for help.
Here is another fair-haired girl, Phyllis
Crossley, who does a number of things, and
does them
well. She
swims, surfs
and plays
more than a
good game of
tennis. But
her real love is
Dalwood, and
for two years
she has work-
ed to bring
joy and happi-
ness to its
little inmates.
As secretary
she has been
par ticularly
busy these
last few
weeks, plan-
ning an d
working for
the success of
“A Night in
Holland. - ’ This takes place on Saturday on
board the Nieuw Zeeland, which the Royal
Packet Navigation Company has generously
loaned to the Dalwood Home Committee.

Once again the Royal Horticultural
Society turned the bareness of the Town
Hall into aisles of beauty. Every year the
decorative work seems to get more beautiful,
the dahlias (it is primarily a dahlia show)
are larger and more colorful and visitors
more numerous and enthusiastic. Joyce
Lawrence, a rosy-looking flower, drew the
eyes of all, and so did the . mauve-pink
Audrey Phillips.
At the celebration for the first time in
Sydney of Hungary’s National Day (March
15), the president of the Hungarian Asso-
ciation, Dr. E. Harden, reminded his listeners
of the dramatic storming of a printing
office 85 years ago, and the printing with-
out permission of the immortal poem,
“Talpra Magyar!” (“Rise, Hungarians!”).
Professor and Mrs. Anderson, she in grey
and black patterned chiffons, came to the
dinner at Ciro’s, and lie got a loud hand
when he spoke of Hungary’s poets and the
wor|d peace that could only come froin an
international brotherhood of men. Mrs:
Harden wore with her black laces a quaint
old gold necklace. A picturesque figure was
Mrs. Matt Kilpatrick in her national Hun-
garian dress, the skirt of white lace, the
white'velvet bodice tightly fitting up.to the
neck and carrying cape sleeves, on the left
shoulder of which were piniicd streamers of
Hungary’s colors, red, white'and green.
The Girls’ High School will have its 50th
birthday on October 8, and. already plans
are in hand to celebrate the jubilee. An
Old Girls’ dinner will be held at David
Jones’s, .which is on the original site of
the school. There will be a back-to-school
day, and a garden party at Moore Park.
Six thousand girls have passed through
this seat of learning, and Helen Taylor, the
honorary secretary of the Old Girls’ Union,
has got the life history of . about 1000, many
of whom have made names for themselves
in the arts or professions. It is intended to
incorporate the data in a book, to be placed
in the school as a permanent record. Some
of the original scholars were at the meet-
ing called last week by Nancy Norris, pre-
sident of the Old Girls’ Union ; so was the
present school captain, and Miss Campbell,
the principal. The Only other principal the
school lias had.is Mrs. L, A. S. Garvin, now
resident in England.
With a father who had been on the teach-
ing staff of the S.C.E.G.S. for many years
and a bridegroom whose father is a member
of. that school’s council, where else should a
girl be married but in Shore chapel? So
Elizabeth Beryl Walmsley walked up the
pathway, gay with blue and white electrics,
in her little puff-sleeved gown of magnolia
satin, a sheaf of tall tiger-lilies on her arm.
and on her head a veil of hand-embroidered
Brussels lace lent by Mrs. Kirby of Lord
Howe Island. This was mounted on tulle
and kept in place by a garland of orange
blossoms. The happy man was orman K.
Stewart White. Two ’maids, Mary Walws-
ley and Joyce White, followed the bucle in
frocks of cyclamen georgette .and little
swathed caps of the same material. 1 oasis

Immediately after the ceremony at St,
John’s, Darlinghurst, Elwyn Thomas aim
her newly-wedded husband, Vivian Brain,
slipped round to see Vivian’s father, who
is a patient at The Terraces. Elwyn mast

silver-threaded, white-corded silk frock, her
tulle veil, which billowed over the long train,
her coronet of silver leaves and the sheaf
of white tiger-lilies and white orchids which
she carried. Kathleen West ’maided in ane-

London, where they will make their home.
Many “in aid of” parties are a success
financially, but few are so enjoyable as that
held at Elaine, the home of Mrs. Hubert
Fairfax. The drawingroom was gay with
flowers and it and the verandahs were filled
with bridge tables. Mrs. Fairfax, in beige,
laces, had a word for every player, so that
no one felt a stranger. The funds go to
the Handicrafts and Home Industries Exhibi-
tion which the C.W.A.. is holding from
April IS to May 8 at the “Sun” Buildings.

St. Patrick’s: Day procession, held this
time six days in advance of the actual date
of the festival, has become more interesting
because- of the competitions among the schools
for- the best marching- and general deport-
ment and encouragement for tableau. The
a-nyhowedness of the parade, with old-time
Irish airs played by bands of all sorts, has
gone, and the street display is better worth
seeing. More pains are also taken over the
sports programme and demonstrations and
if is' hot so necessary to keep. going the
pumps of enthusiasm to make up for defects.

For the Braille Writers’ hook-rug competi-
tion 137 entries were received, and these were
well displayed in the association’s library,
which, by the way, is the third largest in
the world for the sightless. To prove the
durability of these hand-made floor-coverings
some of the exhibits could boast of as many
as thirty years’ service, and they looked
almost new. The Irvine lady launched the
show, some of the exhibits in which were
made by blind workers.
For the first time in the medical history
of this State, specialists in eye, ear and
throat were able to sit in this part of the

Most of us are acquainted with at least
four sorts of ants—-the bulldog, the soldier,
the little black fellows who infest the .sugar,
and the medium-sized brown fellows—but
the trustees of our National Gallery have
just purchased for £2OO a collection of 8000
ants peculiar to Australia, over 1000 species
and several new unclassified varieties. The
collection is the work of John Clarke, a
member of the museum staff. Harvard Uni.
wanted the collection for its museum, and
offered a tempting price, but for once in a
way it has been decided that the scientific
trophies of Australia shall remain in the
land .of their origin.

frock of white hailspot muslin, caught with a narrow
sash at the waist. The skirt was in tiers of
tiny frills, and the same frills stood out' on the
shoulders. The long lace veil was held in place
by a chaplet of orange blossom. Margaret Paton,
Nancy Tanner and Jean Murphy ’maided in flowered

The Old Truth and Nothing Like the Truth
BY HAROLD MERCER.
TRUE ’earts is more than cornets,” said
my landlady, leaning impressively
on her broom —“as pore old Mrs.
Evans would tell yer if she knew the truth,
i he old truth and nothing like the truth, as
they say in the police courts—though God
forbid 1 should ever go near them meself.”
Of course I realised, when she started like
that, that Mrs. Parsley intended to talk;
and, though 1 held my pen suspended in the
act of writing, I knew also that the hint
was useless.
"You never know what the Corner-coupler
of Time may bring you,” said Mrs. Parsley,
giving two sweeps with her broom to show
that that was why she was in my room
really, “and I’m sure Mrs. Evans didn't.
They say them the gods love they grind ex-
ceeding small, and that was Mrs. Evans, if
ever there was one. She lived in Number
lit* and that is small enough for anybody.
‘lt useter be a bathroom, I think, before the
old ’ouses was turned into these residentials."
I tells Mrs. Evans when I showed ’er round.
‘I don’t care how small it is, Mrs. Parsley,’
she says, ‘as long as it’s a place where my
boy can find ’is mother when ’e comes back
from the war.’
“When I ’eard that, my face was the pic-
ture no artist can ever paint, as the saying
is, for it was four years after the war. But
I soon knoo all about Percy Evans; ’e was
reported missing at the front, supposed
killed —which I suppose them ’oo supposed
it lcnoo what they was talking about; but
poor old Mrs. Evans, being an unbelieving
Thompson, wouldn’t believe it. Poor little
lady! She reckoned any day Percy would
come in, back to liis mother.
“We all got fond of the ‘dear little lady,’
as everyone called ’er, waiting tip there in'
’er little room fer ’er boy to return front
the war, which we knoo could never be. Lor
love ’er, unless miracles should come to an
end. Everybody wanted ter ’elp ’er, 'er
only living on the pension ‘ money, but she
was a proud little soul—if anyone as-much :
as lent ’er a penny fer the gas, she’d return
it as sure as eggs', which, after all. isn’t so
certain, ■ every egg being a mystery incar-
nation until you open it.
“But I’ll say. this, that the dear little,lady,
with all the way she must’ve ’ad ter skimp
’erself to live, and the faded little atom she
was with ’er thin little arms, ’ad ’er
moments, as they say. They was on such
times as Anzac Day. when she'd put on all
the pompadour of ’er Mother’s Badge an’
go down to one of them Sehtenioffs with ’er
poor little bunch of flowers, proud as Punch
and Judy that a son of ’ers was one of the
’crocs ’oo laid down their lives in the glory
fields of France; an’, she’d come back, ’er
eyes all wet with crying, to tell ’ow some
big Digger ’ad asked ’er all about ’er Perce,
an’ thought,’e remembered ’im in ’is mob.
an' ’ad taken ’er away ter ’ave a cup er
tea in memory of Perce—;un’ ’ad asked ’er
if she wouldn’t like ter take a bottle er
stout ’ome. in memory of Perce, too. Which
she, refused, being teetotal, but enjoyed just
the same as if she’d ’ad it.
“Pretty well anyone in the residential
would ’ave done nothing rather than seen
an ’air on the little lady’s ’ead ’urt, but
there is people-T call yobs. ‘What in the
’el] d'ye mean- by calling me a yob?’ says
Mr. Mack when I tells ’im that’s what ’c
was. ‘Yes,’ lisays; ‘in,’elk is the right place
fer yob t s,’ I_ says. ‘An’ whatever a yob is
you’re one.’ Which I will admit is about all
I knoo what, a yob was.
“That, was the s morning I told ’im oft
after the night ’e an’ ’is . drinkin’ friends
put their silly joke over the dear little lady.
There are times any woman ’oo keeps a resi-
dential ’as to be blind in one eye like Nelson
on his monument, an’ I didn’t mind Mr.
Mack ’aving ’is drinkin’ parties in ’is room
as long as ’is friends got drunk respectable
an’ didn’t make too much noise about it;
but when I ’ears a row in the passage' and
finds Mack an’ ’is drunken Men’s- there
surroundin’ Mrs. Evans, it. was the last stror
that maketh the ’eart sick, as tlie"Bible says.
“Mrs. Evans was ’oldin’ a great big
feller, ’o'o was silly-drunk, by the ’and; an’
she was lookin’ shy as a, girl. ‘Oh, Mrs.
Parsley!' she called ter me. ‘Mr. Mack
thinks ’o ’as found my Percy fer me! This
gentleman! He looks something like Percy
might, ’ave grown ; but Percy was only a boy
when ’e went, to the war. An’ the gentleman
came back from the war with his memory
gone. Mr. Mack says ’e remembers ’im as
Percy Evans. But I don’.t know what to
think —it ’as took me so-by surprise!’
“Z knoo what to think ; the drunken yobs
'ad thought it a good joke to put over the
dear little lady.- I could see the sniggers in
their ugly faces; but. when I glared at them,
they was more like sheep that are led ro
ilm - altar. The chap ’oo was. standing along-
side Mrs. Evans looked real ashamed, I’ll
say that for ’im.
" ‘l’m afraid there -might be some mis-
take.’ he was sayin’. ‘Mack ’ad no right ter
mention it until ’e was certain,’ ’e says,
‘it’d lie better if I come back to-morrow an’
we can talk the matter over,’ ’e says.
“’E went, the pore dear little lady
seemin’ rather glad to let ’im go; an’ the
rest slinks , away, too. The little lady was
all upset, but didn’t see the dirty trick
they ’ad put on ’er, -pore soul; an’ I
'adn’t the .’eart ter let ’er know things as 1
saw ’em. The next day I told Mr. Mack
I’d sooner ’ave ’is room than ’is few shillings,
even if I never let it again, an’ ’e went. An’
T ’oped the dear little lady, ’oo didn’t say
a word ter me about what ’ad ’appealed,
would forget all about it.
“They say the unexpected happens in the
H-'st relegated families. Well, next afternoon,
> ‘see the man ’oos ’and Mrs. Evans ’ad
noon ’olding cornin’ up the stairs, with flowers
an’ a lot of parcels on ’is arm.
“ ‘Yer friend -Mr. Mack is gone,’ I says,
harrin’ the way. ‘I told ’im ter go. I don’t
want anyone in my ’ouse ’oo thinks a dirty
trick played on a pore little old lady is a
joke.’
“ ‘Madam,’ ’e says, ‘a joke like that —if
it was only a joke—would be detestable. As
far- as I’m concerned, the thing wouldn’t
‘ave ’appened at: all, only it was sprung on
me, like it was on Mrs. Evans. But ’ow
do you know I'm not Percy Evan’s? I
assure you,’ ’e says, seeing the look on my
face, ‘that I ain't jokin’ now! At the least
I owe an apology to the little lady; an’ I
want to see ’er.’
“ ’E was so much in earnest I let ’im go
up, but I went with ’im. When we knocked
at the door, she opened it, an' stood there,
white an’ trembly.
“‘Percy!’ she said, sort of uncertain.
“‘Am IV’ he asked, stepping forward an’
adding 'er arm to steady 'er. ‘After - what
'appened last night I ’ad to come an' see
you. They say I was known as Percy Evans;
but, you see, I lost my memory; an’ I came
back as someone else.’
“ ‘You don't look ill—you look all right,’
she faltered.
“ ‘So I am—except as far as the memory
goes.’
“‘Can't, you remember anything?’ she
asked softly.
“ ‘Nothing—except a little woman who
used to fuss about me. A woman like you.
I'd like to feel you are my mother; that I
could look after you, an’ ’ ,
“‘Percy!’ she cried, and clung- to him
a little. ‘I think you arc my Percy; but
it is all so strange after my being told all
these years that you were dead; you mustn’t
liink it queer that I—l’
“She was near breaking down; but Percy
clinched the matter by droppin’ ’ees parcels,
flowers an’ all. an’ fakin’ ’or in ’is arms,
an’ ’rigging "er; an' when ’e did that she
clung to ’im like a linnet, cryin’ on ’is chest
in ’er ’appiness. -
“It was one of the nine days’ wonders of
the world, ’im coinin’ ’ome like a probable
son after bein’ dead an’ all. So you see
what them ’oodlums ’ad meant ter be a joke
’ad worked out right, as it always does fer
them as keeps the lor. A proud little lady
she was, goin’ out with ’er big son ; an’ a
tine son ’e was, too. although not as ‘aiidsome
as what she’d said 'e was by no means; but
an ’olesome-looking feller, 100 paid ’is rent
reglar—’e come to stay 'ere, to be near is
mar—an’ ’crs, too. Not that she'd move
from ’er little room, though 'e wanted ’er
to She wasn’t goin’ to be an interpus upon
’im, she said.
“But ’e did all ’e could ter make ’er com-
fortable an’ ’appy. If ever a woman walked
through green fields, it was that dear little
lady. She wanted ter' show ’er Percy off
to everybody. ‘ ’Ave you seen my boy, come
back from the war after they said ’e was
killed ?’ it was to everybody. So. of course,
she interdooced ’im to Miss Handy—a kind-
’earted little creature as ever was,, ’oo had
always been special kind to Mrs. Evans.
Then when they went to the pitchers or
anywhere their party soon was three; and
Mrs. Evans, thinking two’s company, as the
Bible says, dropped out and let Percy and
Miss Mandy go alone. She didn’t mind; she
was ’appy because they was ’appy, and be :
cause she knoo that before ’e went ter bed
’e’d look inter ’er room an’ say ‘Good night,
Mum,’ an’ creep over soft to kiss ’er. on
’er cheek, if she pretended ter be asleep. I
reckon she pretended often, liking the idea
that ’e’d take the trouble to kiss ’er whether
she was awake or not.
“Naturally the story about ’er Percy
cornin’ ’ome gets about, an’, one day a re-
porter comes up. The poor little lady was
all flustrated. She said she wouldn’t tell
’im anything until she saw Percy, an’ almost
shut the door in.’is face ; and'so ’e came
ter me. And that was why I called Percy
into my room ter 'ave a word with when ’e
came ’ome.
"‘“We don’t want to say anything. Mother
was right;, we don’t want anything pub-
lished,’ Percy, said, almost as flustrated as
the little lady ’erself.
“‘But why not?’ asked the reporter.
“’E kept badgerin’ Percy, which I
couldn’t see ’is reason for meself, an’ added
my word—not that I’m one for advertising,
but I didn’t see no ’arm in it being said
they lived at my residential —until Percy
went to the door to .see it .was shut, an’ then
turned an’ faced us.
“ ‘Look ’ere,’ 'e says, ‘l’m goin’ to tell you
something on your solemn promises ter keep
it to yourselves. I’ll not say a word unless
you promise.’
“’E got our promises, o’ course. •
‘“I ain’t Percy Evans,’ ’e says, slow and
solemn.
“You c’d ’ave knocked me flat, me ’aving
got useter fhinkiu’ that my first oppress.yn
was wrong.
‘‘‘l never ’ad a mother that,l knoo of,’ ,’e
says. ‘I was brought up in an ’ome, an’
boarded out when I was twelve to a place
where the woman wasn’t much of a mother
to ’er own kids, let alone me. I was glad
ter get to the war. I suppose I’ve always
felt.as if I’ve missed something; but I didn’t
notice it much till the night I came ’ere,
an’ a damned silly trick was put on a poor
little old lady by a damned a—a; —’.
.. “‘A yob.’ I says, ’elping ’im out. 1
“‘Quite,’ ’e says. ‘At the time I was
only sorry for the cruelty of it. Then I
thought it over ; the poor little lady, waiting
for the son to return 'oo never would _ re-
turn, an’ me in a sorter way ’aving wanted
a mother all me life; an’ I remember ’ow
she seemed uncertain whether I wasn’t ’er
sou. I came up, not quite decided to say
I icas, but with some sort of idea- of sug-
gesting that, as I was a returned soldier
without a mother an’ she was a, mother
without a son, we might split the difference,
so ter speak, and adopt one another. ,When
she greeted me as Percy I reckoned I’d let it
stand, an’ he ’im. Now. you know why I
don’t want nothin’ published. We might
not be able to live up to the story if it gets
in print. The poor old lady thinks I am ’er
son, an’ it’d be cruel now if anything was
done to make ’er think I wasn’t.’
“The reporter-chap was a good-natured
young feller, an’ ’e saw the point, being as
plain as a needle in a haystack, as the say-
ing is. /
“Everythin’ went, on ’appy after that, with
Percy—l ’ad ter call ’im Percy, of course,
not knowin’ any other name—an’ Maud
growin’ fonder of each other as anyone could
see with ’arf an eye—-or no eye at all, if
you "appened to "ear . their kissin’ on the
stairs, cornin’ up, for that, matter. Seein’
that Mrs. Evans seemed to like it, it struck
me all in a heap when she comes into my
room cryin’ one day.
“‘Oh. Mrs. Parsley” she sobs. ‘They’re
goin’-ter be married next month, an’ Percy’s
asked me to live with them ,in a ’ouse ’e’s
buying at Peak’urst.’
“ ‘Well, dear soul,’ I says, ‘that’s nothin’
to cry over. You’ll bo ’appy as one thing
living with them two, both so fond of you.’
“ ‘Oh, but, Mrs. Parsley,’ she sobs, ‘I feel
such a wicked woman !’
“ ‘WickedV You!' I laughs. ‘Tell me Vi
you’ve murdered,’ .1 says, makin’ fun of her.
of course.
“‘Mrs. Parsley, don’t joke!’ she says. ‘I
felt I must tell someone, so I. came to you.
I can’t go on livin’ a lie. Mrs. Parsley. I
was never married.’
“Of course, I was knocked all aback as
if a blow ’ad took the .wind out of my sails.
If an angel from ’Eaven ’ad stepped down,
wings an’ all, an’ told me she was Dora, of
Darling’urst. it wouldn’t ’ave give me a
worser' shock. An’ yet, the way she speaks
of it, as if it >vas so awful, makes me feel
inclined to open up an’ tell ’er some of the.
things that ’appened to massif when I was.
young, as Gawd knows things ’appen to all
of us.
“ ‘Well,’ says I, ‘there ain’t no good tollin'
your son about it, if ’e don’t know. There’s
many a good woman made a mistake, an’
been no worse a mother fer it.’
“ ‘You don’t understand me.' she answers,
going all red. ‘I didn’t ever make a mistake.
I never ’ad a son.’
“Then she rushed out with ’er story. It
was during the war. she said, she’d got
envious of all the women ’oo’d got sons at
the war to worry over and cry about- an'
say prayers for. So she invented Percy, who
was a pure fabrication; she’d got the
Mother’s Badge from a woman ’oo didn't
prize it like she did, an’ the pension she
was getting was jest an old-age pension.
“‘I pretended—-just, pretended,’ she
sobbed. •Then Percy came, thinkin’ I might
be the mother ’e’d forgotten. I yielded to
temptation—the temptation of tryin’ ter
make myself believe 1 really was ’is mother.
But I can’t go on deceivin’ ’im —’ini' ’oo s
been jest like a real son to me, and ’oo.l'' ’
come to love jest as if ’e teas my son. It
was not so bad while we was livin’ ’ere, but
to go an’ live in ’is ’ouse, knowin’ I was
an imposture—l couldn't!’
“I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry—
the two of them both shammin’ and Blinkin’
they was deceiving the other! An’ yet if
it was made clear to them that they weren't
deceivin’ each other, they’d lose something.
An’ ’ere was the little lady that never ’ur|
as much as a fly on the wheel of fortune
callin’ ,’erself a wicked woman !
“ “Wicked fiddlesticks !’ I says. ’You’ll be
a wicked woman if you make ’im un’appy—
a pore feller ’oo thinks you’re ’is native-born
mother —by doin’ anythin’ or sayin’ any-
thin’ to spoil "is allusions. You’re 'appy.
aren't you? So .’is ’e. The only thing i$
to carry on.’
“‘Do you think so?’ she cried, eager, I
e’d see, to believe me right.
“ ‘lt’s your bounder duty,’ I says.
“And I’m goin’ down ter Peak'ufst tei
see them this - afternoon," concluded Mrs,
Parsley abruptly, seizing her broom again
with an earnest of getting her delayed work
done. “It’s the ’appiest. little ’ome I know
of, fer the Corner-coupler, which Mr. Fel-
lowes used to speak of —’e was a scholard
beside ’aviug been trained in the "ard school
of the University—-’ad other things in stalls
for, the de.ar little lady, ’oo’s the most de-
votedest grandma you ever see.
“But she still goes out on Anzae Day
and Xarmistice with ’er Mother’s Badge on
an’.enjoys ’er cry. It’s for the , mothers oc
od .sons ’oo never came back from the war.

Unquestionably we are passing through a difficult
period. What with the Additional Taxation, Dearer
Liquor and Smokes, Reduced Incomes, or perhaps No
Work at all, it is very easy to become despondent.
I he situation, however, has to be faced cheerfully,
and the task will be found much easier if care is taken
to see the digestive organs are kept healthy and regular.
It is important to bear in mind that one’s outlook on
life is largely influenced by the condition of the liver,
hence the exhilarating effect of a dose, or, better still, a
course of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, which stirs
that organ to healthy action, regulates the Bowels and
cleanses the System generally.

are so characteristic that no mother nee
have any doubts. The best proof of worxr
is worms, and if the general conduct
the child is such as to give the slighte
suspicion a careful watch will give amp
proof.
Worms, by their movements and th
interruption they offer to the contents
the bowels, generally occasion pain o
uneasiness in the abdomen, sometimes spas
modic, sometimes gnawing and biting, an
not infrequently of a vague, indescribabl
character, and yet very distressing. Sympa
thetic with this is a sensation of itchin
at the nostrils, producing a disposition tc
pick the nose, which is characteristic of th
affection. The bowels are often disorderec
sometimes relaxed, as in dysentery. The
appetite is exceedingly variable; in some
cases natural, in others deficient, craving
or depraved, one condition not infrequently
alternating with another. The abdomen is
often hard, swollen and tympanetic, the
breath heavy and foetid, and tongue furred
with disagreeable taste, and a copious flow
of saliva; swelling of the upper lip, bleed-
ing of the nostrils and disposition to grinc
the teeth during the sleep are other charac-
teristic symptoms. The effects, however
often extend beyond the alimentary canal
and various derangements of health are ex-
perienced in consequence either of the
direct irritation of the worms or of the
disordered digestion which they occasion.
Among the most common of these are
nervous affections, such as fretfulness, irri-
tation of temper, wakefulness or disposition
to excessive sleep, disturbed sleep, sudden
starting out of sleep as if from fright, dizzi-
ness, spasmodic movements of the eyelids,
temporary blindness and deafness. General
convulsions are not infrequent in children,
and symptoms strongly resembling “Water
on the Brain” have been ascribed to
worms, and have ceased on their expulsion.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal prepara-
tion, compounded on a scientific principle
for the eradication of worms which infest
the intestines. They contain specific preper-
ties which destroy the worms, but cause
no injury to the stomach or bowels, and
do not weaken the system. The pellets
are prepared in the form of a confection or
lolly, have no disagreeable taste or smell,
but, on the contrary, inspire children to take
them as they would an ordinary sweet.

Just as the
Willard Threaded
Rubber Insulators save the life
of Willard Battery!
INSULATION! . . . that’s the job of the Willard Patented
Threaded Rubber Insulator. It must separate each positive plate
of the battery from the negative. The better it does this, the
longer the battery lives! That’s why Willard uses rubber as
insulation!
This Patented Threaded Rubber Insulator has an insulating value
higher than any other used! Willard Insulators actually outlive
the plates! Thoroughly porous, they allow the electrolyte to
circulate freely at all times —which means that maximum battery
performance is obtained.*
A Willard Thread Rubber Battery will give you real economy —
longer battery life and no reinsulation expense! You’ll get easier
and quicker starts, under all conditions —and more of them!
Willard Threaded Rubber Insulator has established new ideas of
battery value—battery performance—and battery life! Ask your
dealer about the Willard Thread Rubber Battery!
*This Illustration Explains
the Porosity of the Willard
Thread Rubber Insulator,
Motor Supplies Ltd., Brisbane, Roekhampton,
Townsville.
Brooklands Accessories Pty. Ltd., Melbourne.
Porosity simply means the ability of the separa-
tor, or insulator, to permit proper circulation of
the battery solution between the positive and
negative plates. The illustration above shows
clearly the tiny threads, or wicks, which carry
the acid through. There are 5,000 of these wicks
to the square inch in the Willard Threaded
Rubber Insulator. This means easier and quicker
starting for you under all conditions! Practically
85% of all battery ills can he attributed to the
premature failure of conventional insulators.
