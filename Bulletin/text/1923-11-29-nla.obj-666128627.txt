Onoto & Pen
As handsome as it is useful; as reliable as it is simple
to use. Onoto is the beautifully made Pen.
From the first moment when it is unpacked the
recipient is charmed (for Onoto costs more to make
than any other pen sold at the same price).
Then comes the joy of finding it ready to write
(only the Onoto is sent through the post filled '
with ink). And lastly, the ever-growing appre-
ciation of a life-long service of the pen that
cannot leak—that holds 50% more ink than
any other self-filling pen,

Compton Mackenzie
Eight years ago Compton Mackenzie was
the white hope of the literati, the man who
was to join Hardy and Meredith and Joseph
Conrad. His output at that time was
still small. It had begun with “The Pas-
sionate Elopement” of 1910, and it included
“Carnival,” the two volumes of “Sinister.
Street” and the then recently-published “Guy
and Pauline” ; and from one known only to
the small University circle in London which
had engineered the success of “The Passion-
ate Elopement,” Mackenzie had come to be
a man to whom it was the fashion to kow-
tow*. Novel readers began to feel that if
they read Compton Mackenzie, they were not
as other novel readers. His name was linked
with those of Gilbert Cannan and Hugh
Walpole, the irreconcilable rebel and the
dear dean's favorite. This trinity of young
novelists became a literary institution;
more, they furnished commendable cases for
the men of established reputation who were
looking for heads to pat, and there was a
plentitude of patting.
.Just how infectious was the desire to pay
tribute to the newest of these three it-is dif-
ficult to realise to-day. Henry James, con-
templating the younger school of novelists,
became “positively lucid” when writing of
the merits of “Sinister Street.” Clement K.
Shorter was “carried on wings” : the Man-
chester Guardian critic solemnly assured
Mackenzie that the future of the English
novel was in his hands; and though Ford
Madox Hueffer struck a warning note, it
was drowned in a chorus of praise in which
“a prose Keats” was one of the least of the
tributes laid at Mackenzie’s feet. Later the
critical writers w r ere to change their key;
the time was not far distant when “Guy
and Pauline” was to be characterised as
“wearisome and effete” ; when Hugh _ Wal-
pole was to greet “Sinister Street” with “I
refuse to look at it,” and to call “Sylvia and
Michael” “a new chunk from the erotic
adventures of Sylvia Scarlett”; and when
Frank Swinnerton was to describe Sylvia
Scarlett as “an exhibition of talent per-
versely employed.” But for the moment the
sun in the critical heavens shone bright and
the royalties were rolling in. Even that
sane journal the Bookman said of “Guy
and Pauline” (1915) that it “is the great-
est artistic achievement Mackenzie has so
far attained; an achievement which marks a
distinct advance along the whole front held
by the English novel. .. .Consider how many
sare in the other books which
-s as one remembers Tess of
lies looking out over the valley,
■ovary, or Odysseus stripping
it the beginning of the 22nd
1 attitudes in some more lucid
of the figures that move and
the frieze of Neoptolcmus.”
1 in a few sentences to Hardy,
r and the greatest of Greek
-it does not happen to everyone !
“The Seven Ages of Woman” is Macken-
zie’s twelfth novel, and including “Kensing-
ton Rhymes” it is his thirteenth book. To-
day there are few* w*ho do not consider its
author a best-seller and no move. This is
scarcely fair to Mackenzie; for although his
faults are numerous and gigantic, although
he rarely manages to draw a man who is
not a prig, from the beau Charles Lovely to
the devout young Mark Lidderdale, his vir-
tues are large and numerous. Though there
have .been novels with acres of barren ver-
biage, such as “Guy aud Pauline,” “Sylvia
and Michael” and “The Altar Steps,” there
have been others in which he has given
“high-colored visions of full moon.” Chief
among his assets have been his Oxford
career, his originality, his manipulation of
the mildly shocking, his passion for detail
and his prose style. And I should say that
they have been of value to him in something
like that order. For Mackenzie is easy to
read, and that in these days is one half the
success of the popular novelist. More, he
has a passion for detail, a passion shared
by the general public which relishes it in the
newspapers, but had not expected to find it
in the novel before he came. The door-
knobs and chimney-pots of Arnold Ben-
nett went into the night of eclipse when this
new-comer directed his fierce searchlight
upon the outward seeming of his puppets,
upon their lives and characters and circum-
stances. When he describes a man 'you
feel the careful touch of a craftsman ; when
he writes of the interior of the room he
might have been seated in it, so accurate is
every particular of w-all paper, crockery and
curtains. He took unheard-of pains and he
expressed the result in clear, calmly-flowing
prose as gentle in motion as a summer
streamlet; while his dialogue, in most of his
novels, is a welcome change from the drivel
of the day, the elementary economies and
pseudo-philosophy which so often masque-
rades as fiction. His canvas blazes with
primary colors : liis appeal is immediate and
to the eye, and his taste in the pornographic
is “above reproach.” j,
There you have the quintessence of a popu-
lar novelist. Douglas Goldring expressed
it when he saidr “His methods of expressing
human feeling are of the theatre theatrical.”
It is in the emotional moments- that he leaves
you indifferent, unconvinced, even slightly
bored. Witness the death of Starling in
“The Altar Steps,” the climax which comes
on almost the last page, of “Carnival ' and
which is altogether too much for the imagi-
nation, Sylvia’s final succoring of Michael
in “'Sylvia and Michael,” and Michael Fane’s
state of mind after Lily’s infidelity in the
second volume of “'Sinister Street.” Always
Mackenzie attempts to persuade you by the
dexterous use of externals, always he can
write every detail save the one illuminating
phrase which will give you the joy or tor-
ment of one human mind. For" between
him and that mind is the blank wall of his
life at Oxford. Sympathy seems unable
to penetrate the armor of his education ; in-
terest lie has in plenty, but appreciation of
the other man’s position is lost in a mist
of irrelevant detail. “Carnival” and “The
Passionate Elopement” are typical of all his
work in their skill, their humor and breadth
of canvas, jand their faults. For Mackenzie
is not satisfied to give us a plain tale, save
only in “Guy and Pauline,” the story of two
people essentially uninteresting, and even
there he fell into that other trap, the temp-
tation to indulge in “fine writing.”
QUENTIN POPE.
Baudelaire
Baudelaire fascinates more as the reader
grows better acquainted with him, and for
one who knows something about psycho-
logical medicine the interest is largely in-
creased. More than any other poet he is
characterised by moods of depression, alter
nating with periods of placidity which afford
fcod for thought to the neuropath. In
reality, there were two distinct Baudelaires
—the Baudelaire of the charnel-house and
the Baudelaire of a sunny Springtime garden
gay with flowers.
The 10 years which elapsed between the
publication of his first book and his fatal
illness saw a gradual deterioration and decay
of his mental powers. Born in 1821, he was
dead in 1867. He had been found on the
morning of March 29 huddled up at La
Taverfie lioyale in Brussels before a small
glass of alcohol. The friend who took him
home said he was drunk, but it is more likely
that the leakage into his brain had begun
at this time, and had stupefied him, the -alco-
hol imbibed merely precipitating the attack
of hemorrhage. The diagnosis was hemi-
plegia and aphasia, and, as usual, the
paralysis was right-sided. He was removed
to a mental hospital in Paris, and there he
lingered for five months in that awful state
to which Dr. C. MacLaufin has called atten-
tion in his essay on “Death.” Nothing more
inconceivably horrible could happen to a
man than to be immured in a living tomb for
such a Jength of time. A line of the poet’s,
which was prophetic, occurs to me in this
connection. He said in “Spleen” : "I am a
cemetery abhorred by the moon,” and this
described his apliasic and hemiplegic condi-
tion exactly.
He was not appreciated at his right value
while he lived, As is usual with wayward
men of genius. Sainte Beuve said that
there would be no to-morrow for him, while
Gautier, whom he had honored with a flatter-
ing dedication, misunderstood and under-
rated him, and to the end . never knew that
a star of the first magnitude had swum into
the firmament of poetry. Gautier said that
the calices of “Les Fleurs du Mai” con-
tained aqua tofana instead of dew, which
was clever but unkind. Brunetiere regarded
him as a person of unsound mind. Anatole
France, whose criticisms are worth atten-
tion, says that he was an abominable man,
but a great poet, and, therefore, divine. He
compared him with the lady in the Arabian
Nights -who in the daytime ate rice, grain
by grain, and at night visited graveyards
and devoured corpses. In contrast with his
necrophile tendencies we find a cheerful pas-
toral atmosphere reminiscent of Wordsworth
in “Paysage,” 26 lines in all, but every one
perfect. A poet is sitting, hands on chin,
contemplating the universe like an astrologer
of old. Evening comes, and wakes a vague,
unpunctual star, the moon shines, and the
sound of distant bells is borne by the wind.
The seasons will come and go, but in winter
the poet will close windows' and doors, and
give himself up to building fairy palaces in
the land of dreams. There will be blue hori-'
zons, gardens, fountains splashing, birds
singing at night as well as by day, and
other childish fancies will complete the idyll.
He can evoke the Springtime at will: —
Oar je serai plonge dans, cette volupte
D’evoquer le Printemps avec ma volunte,
De tirer un soleil demon effinr et de faire
De mes pensers brOlants une ti£de atmosphere.
“Les Bijoux” w r as the first poem to be
suppressed, but it is not more shocking to
my mind than a study of the nude in a paint-
ing. If art can present the undraped figure
without incurring odium, why,not literature?
A girl, at the request of the ,poet, has dis-
carded her clothes with the exception of
her jewels, which make her look like an
Oriental dancer. The lady has “Les handies
de l’Antiope au buste d’un imberbe” ; and
the concluding lines, doubtless, have fur-
nished the idea for many a picture—the
ruddy gleams of the dying fire lighting up the
lady’s amber skin would attract a painter:
Et la lampe s’ftant rgsignfe a mourn',
Comme le foyer seul illuminait la chambre,
Chaque fois qu’il ppussait un flamboyant soupir,
11* inondait de sang cette peau couleur d'ambic..
In that lovely sonnet, “Tristesses de la
Lune,” the swooning moon is watching the
white shapes that float like efflorescence's in
the infinite azure, and a tear which shines
with an opal gleam falling from the moon
is picket} up by a poet and treasured in his
heart. Sainte Beuve said of this sonnet
that it reminded him of the youth of Shaks-
peare. There is certainly something unreal
and unsubstantial in it suggestive of Puck
and Titania, and it would not be out of
place in “The Midsummer Night’s Dream.”
The sestet is wonderful
Quand parfois sur cc globe en sa langueur oisive,
Rile laisse filer une larme furtive,
Un poete pieux, eungmi du sommeil,
Dans le creux de sa. main prend cette larme pale,
Aux reflets irisfs comme un fragment d’opale,
Et la met dans son cceur lain des veux du soleil. •
He is indebted to his friend Tlieo de Dan-
ville for the idea of “A une mendiante
rous.se.” I find myself repeating
Perles de la plus belle eau.
Sonnets de maltrc Bell eau.
The girl was clad in rags, but her youthful
charms were the pearls and sonnets she had
to offer her favorites. Of course, beauty un-
adorned is the best, in a poet’s eyes:—
Va done, sans autre ornement,
Parfum, perles, diamant,
Q.ue ta nuditC!
0 ma beauts!
Yet a couple of lines from “Le Cadre” de-
clare that beauty is set off by jewels, furni-
ture, knick-knacks and clothes'—
elle noyait
Dans les baisers du satin et du linge
Sa nuditfi voluptueusement.

lslcs of Illusion
Bohun Lynch has edited a bundle of letters
written to him by a friend who left Eng-
land for the New Hebrides in 1912. They
are the letters of Asterik, an Oxford man,
who studied medicine at Barts., taught in
public schools for years, read Stevenson to
his undoing, and then made for the Pacific in
a sailing-ship to feel and taste —as he thought
—the glories of frangipani and surf-beaten
reefs under a tropic moon. Unhappily, he
chose the New Hebrides, the vilest of. the
Pacific groups, if I may bar the Carolines.
In the Hebrides he found beauty at first —
not the lotus charm that he had expected,
but scrub such as he had dreamed about,
long beaches and a calm, blue, sleepy sea.
He worked on a plantation, then got a job
as interpreter for the Condominium Court.
During all this time he was kicking against
the pricks, and cursing the fate that “sent
Orstrylyuns to these beautiful lands.” The
careless living of the men he met angered
him. That they could live with native
women disgusted him. That they could go
unwashed made him snort —until he learned
that fever followed a wash in the sea. After
he tired of the interpreting job he went sur-
veying, roughed it with a vengeance, took
to drinking whisky a little more than had
been his practice, and magnified his hatred
of all things Orstrylyun. In the end he came
to managing a plantation and keeping a
woman. Plis first mention of his “degrada-
tion” is delicate: “My Polynesienne is away
on a visit to some of her fellow-savages at
Mosquito Bay, so I am alone in my humpy.
....” Then :
I confess to you that the thing is rather grow-
ing on me. The oddness and quaintness of the little
person appeals to me.... What is she? A little
nut-colored savage less than five feet high.... It
is only when I find that she has stealthily filled
up my shoe with sugar from her ever-accompanying
tin that I realise what an absolute baby she is.
Madame passes her time “making the most
impossible bungles and botches which she is
pleased to call ‘calico b’long bloody piccaninny
b’long you’. ” She is 15, is madame, when
Bilbil arrives.
Before Bilbil’s coming Asterik has no
doubt as to what he will do with him. He
will bring the little brat up as a native—
no coddling, no tommy-rot about him. When
he does arrive Asterik comes to love him,
then to plan for his future. The first half-
caste to go to Oxford ! In the end he sends
madame and babe away with a wave of the
hand, and a break in his heart. He goes
to Sydney—and loathes it. He loathes any-
thing and everything Australian. He is still
a snob, even after eight years in the New
Hebrides, but a snob with some accuracy of
observation. He hates also the Presbyterian
missionaries and their humbug—he tells some
stories that I told 20 years ago when I came
back from seeing them at close quarters on
Ainbrym and Tanna and the other islands
where they have reduced a fine, vigorous
race to a race of tuberculous mendicants ; the
same stories—evidently the missionaries have
not improved. After eight years he leaves
the Hebrides to go back to England. He
gets as far as Sydney, but finds it more
awful than on his previous visit. Sid, Lez,
Gus, Alf and Tib get horribly on his nerves.
The Sydney cooking appals him. Will it
be the same in London? He decides that,
maybe, it will, and accepts a job in Tahiti.
Here he finds the hibiscus, and the tiare, and
the surf booming on the reef. Here he gets
back to health, finds work that is congenial
and is “just beginning to know what happi-
ness beauty can give.... ”
This book has the atmosphere, for Asterik
has lived the Island life; he has not been a
tourist. Pie has had malaria and dysentery.
I didn’t have them as long as he, but I
suffered them first in the Hebrides —up where
the old Mambare hammered her keel on the
reef with every wave that passed under her
—and I know that Asterik speaks the truth.
He nearly “went native,” but the Sahib
in him saved him in the end. There are
some horrid things in the book, and it is not
intended for the nursery shelf; but it should
be read by every man who has dealings with
our neighboring isles, yet knows them not.

Salesmanship in the Writing Game
“Writing to Sell,” by Edwin Wildman, is a
product of the finest modern culture of the
United States.
The author has had the happy idea of
compiling a manual of instruction for people
engaged in the literary game, or what lie
describes as “a first aid” to literary crafts-
manship. It is a practical book. There is
no nonsense in it about the problem of style
or literary technique or any fantastic doc-
trine of art for art’s sake; the author de-
votes all his energy and erudition to the
much more important subject of salesman-
ship. “The most successful writers,” he says
emphatically, “are the best salesmen of their
wares.”
Mr. Wildman never forgets the great guid-
ing principle of life and literature that busi-
ness is business. He has some wonderful
chapters on “a study of advertising appeal,”
“writing down to the people,” “variants in
the writing game,” “saleable material,”
“point of contact” and other live topics. In
writing down to the people—that is, 90 per
cent, of popular-magazine readers—this
accomplished guide gives rather startling
advice. “You must literally stab their men-
tal faculties,” _he says, “with a sound of
alarm.” This is the best method (whatever
ic may be) “of reaching the elemental in
human beings.” He illustrates many of his
points by charts and diagrams. For instance,
he has designed a pyramid divided into three
parts : the broad base, which is called “de-
scription, facts, the real story”; the second
portion, “light opening, to get interest” ; and
the apex, the “point of contact.” This
method may be over the heads of beginners;
but his chart that gives the relation
of the point of contact” to “the pro-
portion of marketable opportunity” is an in-
valuable piece of work, and deserves careful
study by every scientifically-trained and up-
to-date author.
Mr. Wildman is a true optimist. Under
his glowing pen literature appears to be quite
a possible profession. There is a market for
all kinds of literary wares—magazine articles,
JleW s Stories, interviews, features and fac-
tion. Even poetry, which he discusses in
the same chapter with the kindred subjects
of jingles, jokes and advertising slogans, is
not despised. “I cannot presume to offer my
advice,” he states, “upon the actual inspira-
tion of poetry, except to say that the art
can be developed by study and practice, and
can b e ma de the source of considerable in-
come_» Modern magazines demand “poems
0 f optimism, of delightful, refreshing fancy,”
and look askance on gloomy poems. _ There is
not the money in gloom and pessimism there
used to be. “The modern editor is a sales-
man of pleasantry and happiness.” He will
have nothing to do with depressing thoughts.
“Look upward and forward” is his motto.
Mr. Wildman explains that there is a motive
in this. To create a happy and “inspira-
tional” atmosphere is not merely better sales-
manship for his publication, but also better
policy for the advertising patronage. Obvi-
ously, sad thoughts and wistful sentiments
are not conducive to the buying mood,
Many learned books have been written on
the principles of literature, from Aristotle
to J. Middleton Murry. But all the old
critics have concerned themselves with mat-
ters of purely aesthetic interest. They have
ignored the supreme art, that of salesman-
ship. It has been left to Mr. Edwin Wild-
man to bring us back to solid reality,
LOUIS ESSON.
Roderick McCrae Wright
Mary Yeo thinks (R.P. 18/10/’23) that
Australians would take more interest in
Australian poetry if they knew more about
Australian poets. It seems a pity that for the
want of such a little thing Australian poetry
should suffer neglect; so I hasten to make a
collection of personal notes regarding my
friend Roderick McCrae Wright:—
K. B. Welsh’s Diary and Letters. —Hardly a hand-
some figure. .. .Markell’s description, “as tall as
Quixote, as fat as Sancho,” catches R.M.W. exactly.
I met him once, during our early acquaintance, at
the old First and Last Hotel, and, placing a shilling
on the counter, invited him to drink. Imagine my
surprise when he exclaimed: “Do you mind if I
take this shilling into the thrippenny bar, where I
can obtain four pints of beer with the same money ?”
Before I could answer he had vanished through the
swing-door into a room full of sailors.
Aubrey Lewis’s Journal, 1923. —An ugly old man
who was so saving as never to afford paper, but
wrote verses upon the inside walls of his house,
which, after they had been copied down by an affec-
tionate neighbor, he would immediately rub out.
Two bricks went to a verse of his writing, as may
be proved by the exhibit shown in the Sydney
Museum. While he was young he worked with a
circus, and he told me he would often, in the winter-
time, sleep very comfortably wrapped in an ele-
phant’s ear.
Muir’s Standard Poets of Australia. —Roderick
McCrae Wright was quite mad. . . .Would throw kisses
to statues in the Public Gardens.... He had a dog,
and often went on all fours to him, or scratched in
the same hole. He wore a top-hat fastened with
ordinary safety-pins, which he never took off, but
even got into bed with it. He was, besides being a
poet, an inventive genius, and was responsible for
the musical razor so popular in the early ’twenties;
a safety rocking-horse, especially designed for the
use of adult convalescents, was another evidence of
his resourcefulness.
Brady’s Personal Reminiscences. —When R.M.W.
smiled it was like lifting the lid off a piano—a
vision of straight, unspotted teeth. When he laughed
it was as if the elements contained under the bass
keys had been suddenly let loose at a soldiers’
concert.
Oray’s Memories of Great Australians. —R.M.W.
was an indifferent mathematician. I remember him
talking on this very subject to Tom McMahon, of
The Bulletin Newspaper Co. They were in a
restaurant, and the cashier had put some money
upon the counter. “See, Tom,” says he, “here’s
a pound’s worth of change. I can’t reckon it. I
just take it on trust. I am as simple and innocent
as a child.” “To the Devil with such innocence;”
replied Tom. “That’s ray change you have put into
your pocket!” R.M.W. had to disgorge, but McMahon
very wisely refused to allow him to count it.
Morrison’s Biographical Recollections. —Roderick
McCrae Wright was once nominated for the position
of editor of Biggin’s Quarterly, but Caius Johnson,
who made the nomination, was adjudged non compos
mentis, with the result that R.M.W.’s claims to the
chair became void. When he was in his 87th year
he married an old woman from Jungalloungalong;
but his wife, instead of proving the helpmate he had
so anxiously desired, became an added burden, she
being stricken with epilepsy during their honeymoon,
so that he was forced to nurse her until her death, on
his 92nd birthday. Four months later he fell into
a deep well. His nephew, who was of an idle dis-
position, did not trouble to draw the poet out again,
but satisfied himself with bricking up the entrance
to the well. R.M.W. has never been seen since.
And if that isn’t good for the sale of a dozen
and a quarter of Roderick McCrae Wright’s
“Sonnets and Sunburn” I shall feel that I
have a grievance against Miss Yeo.
MACAULAY BOSWELL.
A Satchel of Books
The Oldest Letters in the World, by Mrs. Sydney
Bristowe (Allen and Unwin). Mrs. Bristowe sets
out to prove from brick tablets and other ancient
documents that the Israelites conquered Tyre and
Sidon and the whole of Palestine. The book will
no doubt be fascinating reading to people who like
prying into other people’s correspondence.
According to Gibson, by Denis Mackail (Heine-
mann). A book of pure fun, written in the form of
shout stories which are the supposed experiences of
the raconteur. The reader will find himself for
days remembering with a chuckle the gentleman who
writes letters to the paper, “The Mystery of the
Managing Director,” and, a gem of the collection,
“The Literary Agent.” Denis Mackail should cer-
tainly be encouraged.
Under-London, by Stephen Graham (Macmillan).
One can’t give Graham higher Australian praise than
that he is the Dowell O’Reilly of England. There is
the same gentle touch, the same big heart, the
same clear-seeing eye. “Under-London” is for the
most part the story of half a dozen boys who
giow up in an outer suburb that London slowly
swallows —a fine study of the development of youth ;
yet a study that makes very easy reading.
Doctor Nye, by Joseph C. Lincoln (Appleton, New
York). Another of this entertaining American’s yarns
of the mostly-primitive folk of the Cape Cod country.
Lincoln’s plots are not conspicuously ingenious: in
this case, for instance, the material facts are visible
from a great distance. But on the way you are
bound to meet a few 1 people that you are glad to
make friends with; and they seem very real while
they are with you. And all the humorous relief you
want you can get from the simplicities of these small-
town folk.
Love Conquer,? All, by Robert Benchley (John
I.ane). Articles reprinted from various American
papers. They range over a wide field —
teach how to make a Spring planting, play
a game of chess or avoid a baseball march.
There is an illuminating treatise on inter-
national finance, and another on Portland cement.
In short, Mr. Benchley is a Heaven-born and world-
wide leg-puller. He approaches his subject with all
the ponderousness of one who labors under the delu-
sion that the thinking world will be shaken by his
brainquakes; and before you know where you are he
is treating a solemn subject like Portland cement
very much as a guttersnipe might treat a silk hat.
It would be worth a place on any bookshelf if it con-
tained only the biting articles on “Suppressing
Jurgen,” “Anti-Ibanez” and “Mr. Bole’s Americanisa-
tion.”
The Novels of Mark Rutherford (Fisher Unwin).
A finely-produGed set of reprints of William Hale
White’s four novels —-“The Revolution in Tanner’s
Lane,” “Clara Hopgood,” “Catherine Furze” and
“Miriam’s Schooling”—and his two volumes of spirit-
ual autobiography. They will be welcomed by those
who have been caught by the serene simplicity and
delicacy of White’s art, and who can echo what H. W.
Massingham says in his memorial introduction:—
“For many years these tales and musings of
‘Mark Rutherford’ have been my companions, always
cherished, and never long laid aside. And, to an
ever-growing circle of readers they have seemed to
be wells of truth and poetry, hewn from spiritual
rock. If their special appeal be to the sad or the
solitary, to minds dazed by the world’s' shallow noise,
even when undeceived by it, they are not morbid,
and travellers to dream cities who share ‘Mark’s’ pil-
grimage will find good entertainment on the way.”
Two Years in Southern Seas, by Charlotte Cameron
(Fisher Unwin). Jottings of a trip that took in
Hawaii, Sydney, Papua, Fiji, Samoa, the Society
Group and the Solomons. Although there is a
“tourist” tang about her visits, and here and there
evidences that she has listened a little too confidingly
to tales of garrulous Oldest Inhabitants, still Mrs.
Cameron has set down an interesting lot of impres-
sions. But it is rather a breathless business follow-
ing a person who fires off this sort of machine-gun
paragraph:—
“In going through New Zealand I was surprised to
see so many tiny houses. I did not note one impos-
ing place. Sheep with baby lambs were there in
multitudes. At Wellington I went to the Midland
Hotel, and, to my great delight, found that they had
rooms with baths — a la Amerieaine.”
The lady heard many good stories by the way, and
she introduces some entertaining bits of Island his-
tory ; but the most overworked word in the book is
“cannibal.” Mrs. Cameron apparently approached
Brown Brother with a shuddering consciousness of
her own plumpness, and although she never saw the
gentleman except in close contact with whites, her
comical iteration of “cannibal” suggests that only the
grace of God prevented her taking a header into the
cooking-pot. However, the much-travelled writer
deserves well of Australia. She sings its praise with
a full, warm note. And for that she must be for-
given for saddling us with “enormous cobras with
their long bodies as big round as one’s thigh.”
Tales of Nasr-ed-din Khoja (Nisbet). Henry
D. Barnham, C.M.G., after 40 years’ experience of
John Turk in the Levant, has translated these
famous Tales. The Khoja who lived in Angora at
the time of Tamerlane’s invasion is the typical Turk
—lazy, garrulous, sly, dirty, philosophical, humorous
and brave. Many of his most impudent jokes were
at the expense of the ruthless descendant of Genghis
Khan, and the latter heard home truths from this
strange courtier which would startle many a modern
sovereign-—as that on Judgment Day he would be
directed straight to Hell. 'lt is interesting to find
in these five-centurv-old anecdotes the genesis of
scores that are still in circulation —the story of the
bird that couldn’t talk but thought a lot, and most
of the favorite mother-in-law quips, for example.
The book will particularly interest those Diggers
who met the Turk.
Barrack and Bush in. Northern Nigeria, by Herbert
C. Hall (Allen and Unwin). Not very well written
recollections of what the Western Soudan was like
20 years ago; yet an interesting enough account of
very rough pioneering. Incidentally, there are
references to the schwartz mamba, the deadly-poisonous
snake that the naturalists of the “Aboriginalities”
page have lately been disputing about. This man
swears to one “nearly 12ft. long’’; but he declares
that, notwithstanding the plentifulness of various
vipers, only once did he come across a fatal case of
snakebite. As for the “spitting” snake, “Countless
Africans have given that as the reason of their loss
of sight, but inquiries generally revealed the fact
that disease was the real cause.” But most readers
will find the stories about the natives and their cus-
toms more interesting. Not always very pleasant
customs, from our point of view. Thus, in Bornu,
“the lady of any taste has her hair plastered down
with cowdung till the crow'n is an inch thick with
it. The hair that protrudes below this dressing is
plaited into numerous little tails that, well greased,
hang round her neck, face and ears.” Still, probably
some Bornu book-reviewer is at this moment remark-
ing upon the dreadful white-woman fashion of putting
powdered earth upon the face and smearing the lips
with —well, what woman who uses it knows what it
is ?
•
“M. 8.”: “Exul” (B. l/11/’23) disagrees with some
remarks of mine on the study of languages. It is
obvious that a study, such as Classics, which may
be important or even indispensable to advanced edu-
cation, may be of minor importance or inappropriate
to more elementary forms of instruction, with which
I was mainly concerned. Only “Exul’s” implied
belief that I speak through ignorance drags from me
the otherwise irrelevant statement that to a com-
pulsory concentration on three foreign languages
during youth I trace some lamentable gaps in my
stock of general knowledge.
“8.C.F.”: Out of my “gesticulating and frenzied
stupidity” let me endeavor to reason gently with Mr.
Lindsay (R.P. 8/11/’23). To speak of “the vulgar
desire for generous emotions —love [in the Christian
sense], faith, charity”—in the disparaging way
which Mr. Lindsay pleases to affect is merely silly.
“Of course he [Nietzsche] deifies only all that seeks
strength, passion, laughter, grace.” But why of
course? The repeated employment of that term re-
veals Mr. Lindsay as a merely dogmatic immoralist.
Nietzsche described himself as an immoralist, but at
least his immoralism purported to be psychological,
whereas his apostle never gets beyond an assertion.
The truth about Nietzsche is that the psychology
upon which his system is based is fundamentally
defective. Power is not the only desire instinct in
human nature; self-abnegation lies as deep. Nietz-
sche’s is a one-sided development in philosophy. Mr.
Lindsay’s is worse—-it is a deliberate and wilful
blindness to reason.
“Skyological” on reformed English spelling:—
The advocacy of reformed English spelling by
“Feng-shui” (R.P. 25/10/’23) is rational, but to
say that mere simplified spelling will make English
“the real universal language” reveals the shallow
thinker, and the classing of Volapuk and Esperanto
as rivals merits a stronger term. Volapuk is long
extinct, and Esperanto is, in everything except official
recognition, the real universal neutral language. For
all the alleged commercial supremacy of English, an
English letter will be less readily translated in Fin-
land, for example, than an Esperanto one. The
report of the General Secretariat of the League of
Nations contains a list of 17 countries where Espe-
ranto is taught in public schools. That simplified
spelling would make English less international is
a fact overlooked by “Feng-shui.” The spelling
deformities of English ally it with other European
languages equally unfortunate. Simplified spelling
will be a boon to the young generation, but it will
not touch the international auxiliary language move-
ment.

Dear Green Earth.
The glad Spring came to me with songs and
cheering,
And all the joyous surge in gardens found;
The magpies fluted and, to my heart hearing,
Colors and scents grew clamorous as sweet
sound.
At many an opening rose my soul I lighted,
Re-silvered memory in the glinting rain ;
And through the wonder and the glory sighted
Earth’s dear green immortality again.
Oh, when I no more see you friendly
gleaming,
And I, immortal too, have passed afar
To some high heaven beyond the farthest
star,
Unless God ban all memory and dreaming,
I know my heart will break in Heaven for
earth,
And, spite of angels, hear a songbird’s
mirth !

O Sorrow, where is Joy?
Impending evil, I avow,

There’s but one bird upon the bough—
O Sorrow, where is Joy?

Harmony.
There is sealed music in the rose’s beauty,
A vibrant charm within the murmuring
shell;
A thorny path belongs to stern old Duty—
A lyric fragrance and a song as well.
All things have beauty if we can but see it;
The age of inspiration need not pass.
The very dust knows miracles. For me it
Fondles that wondrous magic which is
grass.

The Lost Loves.
Now that he’s gone and I am rapture-free
I shall return to my old loves again,
And seek from them some solace for this
pain
That hangs me high upon a sorrowing tree.
The rope of kisses wound about my throat
Is tied with dreams upon a bough of grief,
Curving with my sad weight, and every
leaf
A tear that I have wept for Love’s lost note.
O little songs, my dear lost loves, come swift,
Dance to me now on tender capering feet!
Ruffle your fingers through my hair; your
sweet
Glad mouths spill in my ears some lyric gift.
Oh, let me thus forget his mouth that crept
Laden with whisperings of my delight.
And, ah—sweet robber —in the envious
night
Stole my surrendered mouth before we slept!
I’ll hold you, happy songs, against my breast
Lest haply I should weep remembering
How often there his questing hands would
cling,
How often there his dream-dark head would
rest!
I have called back my dear lost loves to fill
This desperate need with beauty’s beckon-
ing song;
Their bright hands in my hands, I dance
along,
And yet—and yet my heart will not be still.

PANMELA TRAVERS.
Poor Louise.
She minces as she walks along,
And laughs up to the sky,
She gathers from the air a song
You do not hear —nor I.
She has the look of some lone child,
She talks to quiet trees;
And all the magic of the wild
Cries love to poor Louise.
She plucks the fern and purple bell
And twines them in her hair;
And wreathes the scarlet pimpernel
Round ankles burnt and bare.
And how she laughs and laughs aloud
To hear the starlings wheeze
(Where all the hooded chimneys crowd),
“Louise, Louise, Louise!”
She has no man, though she is maid —
Oh, she will wear no wreath !
Only the winds her hair shall braid,
With broken buds bequeath.
And she shall know no marriage-bed
But that beneath the trees,
With leafy coverings all spread
Around for poor Louise.
She walks alone in worlds of dream
With phantoms at her side.
Where living creatures do but seem
As shadows on the tide.
But yet she laughs, from care aloof,
To hear the starlings wheeze,
Long-looking from the guttered roof,
“Louise ! Louise! Louise!”

THE THREAT TO THE ENTENTE.
A carle disclosed last week that the French
Government “is providing for an additional
expenditure of 6,000,000 francs annually for
the circulation of French information
abroad.” It is a belated effort to counter
the flood of German propaganda which is
sweeping over the world. The position of
the. French is that of a common type of
returned soldier. When the war was on
and their richest regions were being devas-
tated impartially by foe and friend, the
French were deluged with promises. None
was more vociferous than their present
critic, Lloyd George, the man who was going
to “dredge the pockets” of the Huns for
reparations. Quarter of a century ago
Rudyabd Kipling wrote of Britain’s Tommy
Atkins that the moment the guns ceased
to shoot it was “kick him out, the brute”;
and that is the convention which is operat-
ing against France. France stands for
everything the rising generation wants to
forget—the horrors of the war, the frantic
pledges of place-hungry politicians, the
Empire rhetoric of profiteers, and, above
all, that maleficent thing Militarism.
There are ‘ millions to-day to whom
the sight of a soldier in uniform
is an offence—who are exasperated even
by the presence of an ex-soldier, such as
General Monash, in civilian clothes —and
most of them hate France. France, like the
average returned soldier, typifies nation-
alism, whereas internationalism is the
fashionable creed of the growing band whose
political orientation is towards Moscow. The
prominent advocate of internationalism who
attacks France as a symbol of the thing he
most hates —love of country—is the analogue
of the Labori to who attacks returned sol-
diers for having been foolish enough to fight
for their country. And there are others—
for instance, that large section of British
capitalism which dislikes the presence of the
French in the Ruhr, or any other factor
tending to impair Germany’s capacity to buy
British products.
It affords the war-worn soldier no satis-
faction to be told, when he asks for what
he was taught during the war years to re-
gard as his rights, that his insistence is an
unpleasant manifestation of barrack-room
arrogance, and that, anyhow, economic rea-
sons prevent the fulfilment of promises made
under the duress of fear. Similarly, it must
be difficult for the French to appreciate the
logic and equity or the demands now being
made on them that they should deal gently
with Germany. America made an unparal-
leled fortune out of the war. Japan doubled
its wealth without any appreciable loss of
life. Britain emerged inter alia with the
whole of German East Africa, about half
German \\ est Africa and a like area in
German S.-W. Africa, and the Mesopotamian
mandate which clinched the Empire’s posi-
tion as oil-mistress of the world. Anyone
who troubles to turn to the whirling oratory,
British and American, of the first half of
1018, when the loss of the Channel ports
appeared imminent, will find that the least
of the assurances given to the people over
whose soil the fighting raged was that they
would be paid in full for all damage done,
and that the Hoiienzollerns would be
exiled. (Political revivalists of the Lloyd
George type were for dismembering Ger-
many and hanging the Kaiser ; but some
held, even in that fevered epoch, that these
were impracticable proposals.) France has
paid, so far, largely out of her own pocket,
in military pensions, allowances to soldiers’
families, emergency help to families of dead
soldiers, apparatus for the mutilated, medi-
cal attendance, compensation to civil vic-
tims of the invaded provinces, allowances to
wards of the nation, etc., nearly 32 milliards
of francs. Germany engaged at Spa to pay
France 621 milliards of gold marks: she
has paid less than two milliards. As it is
now over nine months since she defaulted
as regards all her French obligations, and
as, since then, the capacity of the Germans
to pay has been decreased both bv their own
action in sending capital out of the country
and by that of the French in putting troops
into it, there appears little prospect of so
much as a tenth of the reparations bill being
met.
As for security, the French have all along
maintained—as the entire British Empire
did during the fighting—that the basis of it
was a banishment of that monarchical spirit
which if it did not actually make the war
was certainly the inspiration of the army
that began it. The rejection of Kaiserism in
the sense of the permanent exclusion of the
whole of the Hohenzollern family was im-
plicit in the peace terms to which Germany
agreed as an alternative to encountering at
the hands of Foch the indignity to which
France had had to submit half a century
before at the hands of Bismarck. Most of'
the petty German kings who flourished be-
fore the war are at home, find active against
those republican institutions which France
regards as her safeguard against another
Prussian-fomented war for world domina-
tion ; and the other day the Crown Prince—
a far noisier Jingo than the Kaiser right
up to the end of the great 1918 retreat-
made a triumphal return to the Fatherland.
It was significant that a demand for another
war with France should have synchronised
with his home-coming, and hardly to be
wondered at in the circumstances that the
French should have protested. Dr. Strese-
man’s reply was a blunt refusal to exclude
the Kaiser’s heir—an attitude which would
have been as inconceivable a few years ago
as that which the Germans have lately
adopted over their reparations obligations,
and a fair measure of the extent to which
the nation has got its head up again. Grati-
tude to France, when it goes to the length
of abiding by war-time promises, is no longer
regarded as business by many, and Germany
knows it as well as the unpatriotic employer
and the anti-patriotic industrialist realise
that, for practical purposes, Soldiers’ Pre-
ference Acts are no longer operative.
#•* * *
It seems inevitable that the friendshto
sealed between men of French and British
stock on so many sacred battlefields must
shortly end—-as inevitable as the passing of
the old regard for the A.T.F. which is occur-
rifig before our eyes. The forces operating
in favor of Germany are too strong. Those
who want to trade with Germany are re-
creating the popular figment of the pre-war
German trader —a mild, stout, simple crea-
ture, loving his pipe and his beer, and wish-
ing no ill to any man. Conversely, the
Frenchman is resuming his old role "of the
vicious degenerate, though this was the re-
verse of what the soldiers found him to be.
Those who are working for the overthrow
of the capitalist system will be on the side
of the traders, on this issue, anvhow • in
their eyes, the French spirit is a challenge
to every big principle behind Sovietism. And
so Germany may take heart of grace and
rise again. The political observer of London
Daily Telegraph, who is regarded as not
only well-informed but generally inspired,
put it this way last week:—
The most serious menace, in the opinion of an
authoritative British statesman, was a final Franco-
German break, owing to Germany’s repudiation of
the Peace Treaty. Just as Germany had defaulted
over reparations, she might shortlv default on
questions of disarmament.
Should that calamity happen. Australian
opinion, according to present appearances,
will be mobilised against the people whose
gallantry and resolution helped so materially
to save our national lives five years ago.
We will find ourselves ranged in opposition
to a nation which wants nothing we possess,
and on the side of our natural rivals in com-
merce, shipping and colonisation. On
grounds of self-interest, no less than on those
of decency and common gratitude, it behoves
us surely to turn a blind eye on the extrava-
gant attacks on the French which are the
rule in so many periodicals, remembering
that if the existing tie is once definitely
snapped it may never be mended again.
JOHN SMITH (39), LABORER.
It is almost certain that one matter will re-
main forgotten after Melbourne has repaired
the wreckage done by the above person on the
Saturday before Cup Day, and when the people
he damaged with bottles are discharged from
hospital, and the above-mentioned person him-
self (his description is taken from the police-
court reports) has finished his absurdly brief
sentence, assuming him to be captured and
convicted. John Smith will still be eligible
to vote and to sit in Parliament, and to be
an active force in the direction of public
affairs. The fact that he is evidently more
numerous than was supposed, and certainly
more unpleasant than was expected, makes
this rather a serious affair. It has been
said very often that Australia is absurdly
averse to sending away the imported undesir-
able, and ridiculously lax in striking off the
roll the indigenous objectionable. Yet there
should be absolutely no room in the political
scheme of things for leaders who say openly
that if they can once get power by the will
of the people they will fix the law 7 and its
methods so as to provide for the legal reten-
tion of pow 7 er despite the wall of the people,
and that if they can’t get the initial foothold
in this fashion they propose to get it by
“brute force” —that was the exact term used
the other day by a shining light of the new
school. Nor should there be any room for
their followers.
Australia has been both generous and
casual in handing out political power. The
idea of a religious qualification for either the
electors or the elected is quite out of date.
The idea of a property qualification lingers
in a small way, and in obscure corners, but
as regards the national Legislature it is
wholly extinct. Voters and members become
qualified at the age ot 21 because nobody can
decide as yet to let the hobbledehoy or flap-
per of 18 have full control of his or her
property, to dissipate at his or her pleasure,
and it would seem ridiculous to authorise a
person to manage the State when he (or
she) is still too young to manage an inheri-
tance of a wooden cottage. Still there has
been a fierce demand in some revolutionary
circles that the voting age should be moved
back to 18, and it was calculated that this
w r ould add 280,000 new 7 electors to the Com-
monwealth list, mostly ignorant, irresponsible,
impressionable and very available. There ai*e
many countries where the age limit, especi-
ally for members, is higher than 21, but in
erratic Russia, which all bona fide Austra-
lian revolutionists take as their Heaven-sent
model, it is three years lower. An Austra-
lian voter need not prove the payment of
any contribution to the revenue, nor need a
member. Neither is called upon to pass an
examination in rudimentary intelligence; and
as the voter without intelligence feels more
at home with the candidate who is minus
the same encumbrance, the average mental
standard of members is not high. An able-
bodied Australian elector or member may re-
fuse to fight for his country even in its direst
need, and not cease to be an elector. Also
he may incite others to refuse, and may
almost openly sympathise with the enemy. It
has been done quite openly without anything
happening. A Federal member need onlv
show himself in the legislative halls once
every tw r o months to retain his seat, and some
State legislatures are less exacting even than
that. A member need not be either civil or
coherent when he makes his rare appearance.
One House at least has the reputation of
being the most disorderly and abusive meet-
ing-place in its_ State. In fact, politicians
are exempted from legal consequences for
slandering and lying about each other. It
may be that if this exemption did not hold so
many of them would be in court that the
finding of a quorum would be difficult. The
advantage of this boorishness is said to be
that it drives aw 7 ay refined men, and thus
reduces competition. Corruption at elec-
tions is almost a matter of course; at any
rate, it is a matter of course at pre-selections,
and the nominal election which follows is
now little more than a matter of form.
There is nothing in particular against a
criminal either as an elector or as a member,
provided he has finished his sentence, or
evaded it, and the way of the naturalised
alien is made easy. Also skill in any occu-
pation or possession of any visible lawful
means of support is superfluous.
* * * *
Time w 7 as when the electorate was too
small; it is now 7 too large. The superfluous
ones on the electoral lists as voters and pos-
sible members are those who have created
the present discreditable situation, and who
intend to make it a great deal worse. The
way off the electoral roll should be made
easier. At the base of the difficulty is John
Smith (29), laborer, as described in the
charge sheet. The largest class and the
most rapidly increasing class in Australia is
that of the unskilled and more or less unem-
ployable worker. It is fostered by the neg-
lect and even the active discouragement of
apprenticeship, by the payment of low Avages
to apprentices, by the paymentof absurdly high
Avages to beguile boys into dead-end indus-
tries, and by the importing craze, which dis-
courages skilled production. The unskilled
are a dismally ignorant class; being wdthout
prospects (save Parliamentary ones), the
average member of it gave up learning and
began forgetting when he left school, where
his attendance Avas irregular. It causes
most of the disastrous increase in the public
debt, for it is felt that actual revolution may
loom if the unskilled and more or less un-
employable are not furnished w 7 ith jobs suited
to their capacity. Tt supplies most of the
violent criminals —the kind who have made
the beer bottle the national Aveapon, vice the
boomerang, now out of date. It encourages
a low type of politician so as not to exclude
its own members from the profitable busi-
ness of politics, and the low 7 type of poli-
tician naturally cultivates it in return, for
if it failed a prop Avould depart from under
him. If political disqualification were added
to the penalty far certain offences there
Avould be some reduction in the most objec-
tionable species of elector and possible mem-
ber. And if. in addition, every candidate
had to produce a diploma attesting that he
had proved the possession of a satisfactory
degree of knoAvledge, just as an incipient
doctor or dentist has to, there would cer-
tainly be a notable slaughter of the more
poisonous variety of Parliamentarian. Then
there might be hope of a strenuous effort to
traiii the next generation to highly skilled in-
dustry, instead of rearing it to be an animal
of burden, a pushite and a prospective crimi-
nal, for the kind of person who is liable to
go round armed with a beer-bottle would
have lost some of his political importance
and a good deal of his “pull.”
A RETURN TO GOLD.
All will agree with the Premier of Queens-
land in his desire for the maintenance of a
sound money basis and the free circulation
of gold. But the causes which have brought
about depreciated currencies must be recog-
nised before we can remove them. Those cur-
rencies had their origin in the war. Forced
issues, unfunded public debts and the un-
adjusted state of the financial burdens of
the long struggle are responsible for the
disorder and for the want of equilibrium in
exchanges. With international exchanges
restored to a parity, or even with the depre-
ciation of sterling banished, one result would
be that the difficulty experienced in the
transfer of the Australian money accumula-
tions in London would fade away.
Any remedial propositions need considera-
tion from every angle. The experience of the
past cannot be disregarded in our present
dilemma. There is nothing new under the
sun, and the financial problems of to-day are
no exception to this truism. The Napoleonic
wars left England with depreciation of the
currency and fallen exchanges to face. She
had, as in the late war, to find most of the
lighting funds, with consequent adverse ex-
cnanges and a drain of gold. This led to
the suspension, in 1797, of cash payments,
the Act of Indemnity in favor of the Bank
of England remaining in force for 22 years.
There was a very general disinclination to
acknowledge that the paper money was de-
preciated. In 1810 a Committee of the
House of Commons was appointed “to con-
sider the Infjli price of bullion” —not, be it
noticed, the reduced purchasing power of
printed currency. The report of. that Bullion
Committee is of the highest value to those
charged with the regulation of currencies.
The committee had to await the confirmation
of time to justify its views, for the House of
Commons, on party lines, not only declined
to adopt the report, but by a large majority
carried resolutions denying the soundness of
its conclusions. The situation now is very
similar to what it was then. The apprecia-
tion in the price of gold is about the same
as in 1810, and the depreciation of the chief
exchange—that with the United States—is
much the same as the depreciation with the
European creditor nations of the former
period. The committee found that “the dif-
ference between the market price of gold
(£4 10s.) and the Mint price (£3 17s. l(Bd.)
exactly measured the depreciation of "the
Bank of England notes.” A recent cable
gives the price of gold as £4 14s. 6d. per
ounce fine, or the equivalent of £4 6s. 7d.
per ounce standard, as against the unvarying
Mint price of £3 17s. KMd. The
New York exchange quotation is $4.36, and
so we have a repetition of an equivalent de-
preciation of the British pound note. That
is to say, the market price of gold is a depre-
ciated paper price, and the extent of the
depreciation is shown by the fact that one
sovereign will still purchase $4.86. whereas
a pound note will buy only $4.36.
With these experiences in view, it will be
interesting to contemplate what would fol-
low an attempt, in advance of the balancing
of the exchanges, to allow gold to circulate
freely and to permit the removal of the pro-
hibition against its export. No acquaintance
with the practical transaction of finance is
needed to realise that as soon as gold became
available it would be eagerly sought for ex-
port, to be devoted (say) to the purchase
of dollar exchange. A one-pound note would
then purchase a sovereign here, which would
purchase $4.86 in New York, with $4.36 of
which a pound payable in London could be
bought, yielding roughly a profit of 50 cents,
or ,say 2s. 3d. on each sovereign secured. This
could have but one effect, the outflow of all
our free gold, as long as gold was procurable
and sterling exchange was at a discount,
with little Jay Goulds springing up in our
midst out of the business.
Com.plete resumption of cash payments,
which had ceased in 1797, was not made by
the Bank of England till 1819. An earlier
attempt resulted in failure. The final step
was not taken till the excessive issue of
paper had been curtailed, and concurrently
the market price of gold had approximated
to the Mint price ; till, also, the depreciation
in the foreign exchanges had vanished.
With the lesson of the past for guidance, it
would be surprising if any attempt to set
gold free in Britain were made before these
necessary precedent conditions are again
established. Although the Bank of England
holds about £127,000.000 in coin against notes
of about £125,000,000, this coin also forms
the metallic reserve against the liabilities of
the Banking Department, and therefore could
not be allowed to suffer depletion. To be
added to the Bank of England notes is the
war-time paper currency of the United King-
dom in the shape of Government currency
notes, now (say) £285.000.000, with a coin
backing of £34,000,000. When these special
or extraordinary issues have been redeemed
or made actually convertible, an improve-
ment in dollar exchange may become appa-
rent; But with a trade balance eonstantiv
adverse to Great Britain, and her “invisible
exports” vanished or greatly reduced, the
restoration of the exchange with New Y’ork
to a parity is far from being realised. The
difficulty is intensified by the necessity, under
the Baldwin arrangement of the war debt,
to remit to New York not less than
$161,000,000 yearly for the present
($23,000,000 principal and $138,000,000 in-
terest on the total amount funded, which was
$4,600,000,000). This is not a passing evil,
but payments are to continue till 1984! The
final payment of principal to be made
in that year is $175,000,000. These remit-
tances must always tend to keep the ex-
changes uneven, upset the course of trade and
prevent a general resumption of gold pay-
ments. Nothing can remove this persistent
disturbing factor but the cheerful though be-
lated assumption by the United States of its
fair share of the total cost of the World
War. This would be the first and the most
important step towards attaining a position
in which gold might once more be released
as freely as any other commodity. It can-
not happen, even within the bounds of the

Empire, till the U.S.A. shoulders its proper
burden, and thus removes the outstanding and
initial obstacle to composing the grievous
troubles of the world. All Americans are
not blind to their obligations, as David
Lawrence shows when he writes : "The big
question is where the responsibility will be
if Europe goes to smash within the next
four months and America has done nothing,
publicly at least, to prevent a situation that
may ultimately become worse for the world
than the war of 1014.” The U.S.A. must
release its financial stranglehold on Great

MARK B. YOUNG.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Wheat Problem.
It having become obvious that the wheat
farmers of the N. S. Wales West and North-
West are, in very many cases, at the end
of their resources, the Government proposes
to come to the rescue. It is difficult to see
what else the Government can do. Provi-
dence has sent one drought too many in
those parts, and they were a doubtful pro-
position at any time. The scheme put before
the'Government is that it should guarantee
advance's up to 80 per cent, of the value of
what assets the farmers have left, the store-
keeping firms, which in many cases hate
1 three years’ arrears uncollected, having about
got to the end of their credit-giving capacity.
There is a streak of pathos ,in the fact that
a large number of hard-working men should
have nothing to show for a life’s work, but
that will apparently be the case with many.
They are an honest and strenuous crowd, but
their future, including the repayment of the
proposed advances, depends on good seasons
at an early date, aud on the wheat market of
the world not going wholly to those animals
which are never mentioned in Holy Writ
save with disparagement. The* outlook is
unhappily not cheering. The latest Federal
“Official Year Book” says that the average
value of Australian wheat at the port of ex-
port was ss. (id. in 1919-20, that it rose to
the amazing figure of 9s. in 1920-21 (though
the rise seems to have done the West little
good),- and fell to ss. 9d. in 1921-22. Now
it is-Pearly a shilling lower than that in
Australian ports. And in Chicago, the
wheat-gambling centre of the world, the
spirits of the bulls are so low that the
National Wheat Council is urging the U.S.
farmer to cut down the wheat area from
62,000,000 acres to 50,000,000. lest by grow-
ing top much he gets a great deal too little.
Australia is a place of extraordinary varia-
tions in the business. In 1921-22 it made
over £34,000,000 by the sale of wheat and
flour abroad. In 1922-23 the estimate is
that it made less than £14,000,000, and if
wool, which “land-settlement” cranks want:
to chase off the land and replace with more
wheat, hadn’t brought in over £57,000,000, it
would have been a shocking year for the
country. Though Australia only grows its
wheat on a small and selected area, it has
had, in the past 15 years, two 91-bushel
crops, two of 71 bushels, and one of 21.
Alaoriland’s worst return in 24 years was
214 bushels per acre; England’s poorest crop
in 10 years was 281 bushels and Scotland’s 36
bushels. The invaluable Smith, in his last
volume of N, S. Wales statistics, says that
it cost Is. 4fd. per bushel to send wheat
from Sydney to England, which is 9|d. more
than it costs the man in Canada or
the U.S., and 6fd. more than it costs
the Argentine. That added to an
average railway haul of 219 miles in the
, State is a heavy handicap in these days
ot low quotations. Pursuing the subject
further, the same authority estimates the
average earnings of a Cornstalk wheat-
grower on 230 acres of grain and 20 of horse-
'teed. Assuming that the farmer employed
no labor, the results for the past six
years were as follows: (1) Profit. £376-
(2) loss, £2B; (3) profit. £113; (4)’
profit, £l6; (5) loss, £103; (6, the year of
rin/ii in^or ® et^:a^e s ‘ P er bushel) profit,
£1046. That meant an average of about 295.
a week for five years, and then an isolated
streak of luck which made the six years’
average about £4 12s. As the streak has
given out, The Bulletin isn’t taking a hand
m the dazzling schemes of any set of politi-
co old-timers to put a million more half-
baked or wholly-unbaked farmers to grow
wheat on a million farms purchased and
opened up with money borrowed at a high
or any other rate of interest. If Australia
a heroic resolve to manufacture for
itself everything that can possibly be manu-
factured here, and to dot the land with small
industrial towns instead of putting all its
factories into its State capitals, the position
would be different. There would be a very
large local market then, and the Is. 4|d. per
bushel of ocean freight would be saved ; also,
perhaps, half of the 219 miles of railway
draggage over the State’s railways.

The Old-Codger Cabinet.
The N. S. Wales Fuller Government has
'leathered another teacup tempest. Beeause
nobody wants a 1923 election it has been
spared the necessity of going to the country
nn a record as barren as the way from Dan
o Beersheha. So empty of performance is
uns _ Nationalist Administration, which
promised so much, that when the Premier
was asked what had been done during the
rt-weeks session he placed the Veterinary
burgeons Bill at the head of the list. The
country asks for reduced taxes, and for some
relief from the burden of supporting swarms
oj. public servants in wholly Superfluous de-
partments ; and Fuller gives it an Act relat-
\ ng ,° horse-doctors. In extenuation of this
desolating inaction, it. is pleaded that the
-Nationalists are in a minority. The same
v as true of the first and second Deakin Min-
istries, but it didn’t prevent them from doing
considerable things for the Commonwealth.
W hen Deakin took office in July, 1905, his
” un i?; rica lly considered, was the weak-
est of the three. But he knew that he could
count on a majority for a resolute fiscal and
financial policy. and lie went right ahead.
ie Nationalists, with 42 members in a
House of ,10. with nine Progressives to help
them against Labor-socialism, with nothing
in fear for the time being from an Opposition
a oakened by the expulsion of McGirr and
Bailey and by the internal dissension
caused by the A.L.P. executive’s proceedings
against A.W.U. bosses and Communists, are
in a far stronger position, actually and rela-
tively, .than Deakin was. For a programme
as bold in its way as that of the Protectionist
leader —a programme starting with a sub-
stantial reduction of taxation and the cost
of government, the latter by the scrapping of
useless departments and State “enterprises”
—they could command a majority. But the
Ministry has no constructive programme,
bold or otherwise. Its idea is that it dis-
charges its duty to the country by keeping
Labor out of office. It dislikes equally the
prospect of a working arrangement with the
Progressives and that of a general election
before the present Parliament has run its
course. The lack of a party majority it
regards as a first-class excuse for doing no-
thing. Its trouble probably is that there
are too many jaded old men in it. Six of its
twelve members are in the sixties. Car-
ruthebs, who is popularly supposed to do
Fuller’s thinking for him, is well on towards
the seventies. The Premier himself is rising
63, whereas Bruce and Theodore (Queens-
land Premier since October, 1919) are
not yet 40; Earle Page is 43; Bar-
well 46 and Lawson 48. Mitchell,
the Westralian, is 57, but three of his
five Ministers are comparatively young. A
couple of elderly gents, are necessary in a
Cabinet-necessary as brakes. But a Cabi-
net in which elderly gents, predominate—
particularly elderly gents, of Tory proclivities,
convinced that all is for the best in this best-
of-all worlds—is a Cabinet 'condemned to
sterility and destined to defeat at the polls.
Only, by a swift reconstruction of the Minis-
try, in which at least three tired and timor-
ous old gentlemen would be scrapped, and
the early passage of radical reform measures
framed in the interests of the oppressed tax-
payers, can a Labor victory be averted in
March, 1925, or whenever the general election
takes place.
An Unfriendly Act.
There are codes of behavior between nations
as between individuals, and one of the most
widely accepted is violated every time that
largely fraudulent horror, the convict ship
Success, is exhibited in foreign waters. When
the last U.S. mail left the Success was at
Buffalo Port, and a line as to the spirit in
which the ancient hulk is exploited and the
sentiments it inspires may be got from an
oration delivered by Mayor Schwab at the
opening ceremony:—
Thank God for men like Washington, Lincoln
and Grant, who freed our country from the British
yoke and kept it free. Had it hot been for them,
we might to-day be suffering even as the poor
wretches suffered on this vessel. Every boy and girl
in Buffalo, particularly every school child, should
see this old ship.
Among the prominent citizens in the retinue
of Mr. Schwab were Commissioner Ivrein-
heder, Police-Chief Burfeind, Detective-
Chief Zimmerman and one Tim J. Cavan-
augh, who claimed to be descended from a
Success convict. The popularity of the show
is understandable in the possessors of such
names: they would be quick to appreciate
it for what it is-—the most poisonously effec-
tive form of anti-British propaganda. “The
Success has held lurid horrors and dreadful
iniquities,” proclaims a half-page advt. in
the Buffalo Evening News, “beside which
even the terrible stories of the Black Hole
of Calcutta and the Spanish Inquisition pale
into insignificance.” Some of the alleged
iniquities are specified (“the branding-irons,
the coffin-bath and other fiendish inventions
of man’s brutality”), and almost without
exception they are crude fakes invented to
gratify German-Irisli dislike of England,
or to give the general body of U.S. sensation-
seekers the worth of their 50 cents admission
fee. It is in the interest of Australia’s good
repute, as 1 tfeli as in that of British-Ameri-
can amity, that this peripatetic libel should
be withdrawn from circulation, or, at least,
amended so as to conform to known historical
facts. If Washington proves deaf to official
representations—representations in which
Britain should certainly 7 join—the Federal
Government will have to consider other mea-
sures. There are plenty available. For in-
stance, we imported goods last year from
the U.S. to the value of £18,823,113, while
they took but £8,314,386 worth of our pro-
ducts in return—and over five millions ster-
ling of that was represented by wool, skins
and hides, which command a ready sale any-
where. And three-quarters of a million ster-
ling of good Australian money goes to the
U.S. every year for the hire of cinema films,
most of which we should be much better
without.

Food and Freetrade,
Nothing could be more eloquent of the weak-
ness of the British Freetrade case than a
Lloyd George argument which was cabled
all over the world last week —that “the only
country in Europe where high wages pre-
vailed. was little Freetrade Holland.” When
the U.K. went Freetrade in the middle of
last century the English harvest and the
Irish potato crop had failed in the same
year. There was a practically unlimited
supply of foreign fqod to be had cheap. Bri-
tain’s wonderful stocks of easily-won coal and
iron had given her a long start in the indus-
trial race; and no nation seemed likely to
overtake her. There was no fear of invasion,
the Napoleonism of France being dead arid
that of Germany unborn. The repeal of the
Corn Laws meant that Britain could live
cheaply on imported food, and sell her manu-
factures virtually at what places she liked
to name _ in those countries which had still
to conceive the idea of manufacturing for
themselves. Small wonder that manufac-
turers were able to amass vast fortunes, while
their employees—though underpaid and over-
worked according to modern standards —were,
envied by the proletariat of the Continent!
To-day Britain, while forced to spend on naval,
military and air defence 111 millions per
annum, and while appreciating that even
this vast sum cannot secure her against
future food blockades, has to import 55 per
cent, of her cereal- and 60 per cent, of her
meat-requirements. Contrast this situation
with that of Holland. One of the chief rea-
sons why Dutch workers are able to earn
the European equivalent of high wages (they
arc grievously underpaid relatively to
those of Protectionist America) lies in
the fact that Holland is what Britain
was—-a food-producing- country. For years
past its chief exports to the U.K. have been
butter, pork, condensed milk, margarine and
other necessaries which had to be rationed
in Britain during the war, and which at one
stage in 1917 were unprocurable. The
British have great wealth, actual and poten-
tial. not only in hard cash, but in the riches
which are represented by the capacity for
work, by skill in industry and commerce, by
character and by their maritime and colonis-
ing genius. They have articles to sell which
none of their rivals can make so well, and
in an age which is turning more and more
to oil they have had the foresight to get in
early in the rush for that commodity. But
they are being profiteered on for tlieir food—
the food that the world was once so eager to
sell them at cut rates —and their plight in
this respect is growing steadily worse. Mat-
ters cannot improve until, like Holland, they
are independent of foreign foodstuffs, and
they have small prospect of achieving that
independence unless they resolve to grow a
great deal more wheat and meat than they are
now producing. The British Freetrade policy
of, in some unexplained manner, "recon-
structing Europe" is not going to empty
Chicago out of the London meat-market, and
secure the nation against defeat by starva-
tion in the next great war; but a tariff will.
The weapon is as much a feature of the in-
dustrial armories of those nations which,
unlike Holland, mean to fight on for tlieir
past greatness, as gas has become in the mili-
tary sphere.
«
, Importing Anarchy.
“Tile Anglo-Saxon Klan, an order of the Invisible
Empire, has been formed in a Sydney suburb.”--
,1 news item of the week.
The mistake of all extra-legal bodies is that
made 10 years ago by the Germans, then
the Ku Ivlux Ivlausmen of the Continent:
they cherish the delusion that Shown, who
favors one way of life, can forcibly induce
Smith to adopt it, though the latter believes,
heart and soul, in a totally different system.
Social and political institutions are like reli-
gions : however rotten they may be, the first
sign of an attempt to reform them by
violence provides reinforcements in the shape
of adherents who are willing to fight like
devils against change. Resistance satisfies
the reformers that they were right in attack-
ing a thing backed by such a truculent lot
of unregenerates, and before the State knows
what the trouble is about it lias a civil war
on its hands. An item which appeared in
Sydney Sun a few evenings ago indicates
what is happening to law and order in the
F.S.A. as the outcome of a private organ-
isation's attempt to give the law a hand:—
One hundred and fifty members of' the Ku Ivlux
Klan were surrounded in the Masonic Hall at Perth
Amboy, New Jersey, by a crowd of 5000 angry citi-
zens. For hours the police had held back the crowd,
to prevent them from wrecking the building and
mishandling the Klansmen. The mob charged down
towards tile building, but the police barred the way,
tiring pistols, throwing tear-gas bombs, and using
clubs. The Fire Department was called out to assist
the police,, but the firemen’s cold water seemed to
increase the ire of the angry demonstrators, and the
hose pipes were soon put out of action. Meanwhile
some of the Klansmen with the aid of the police
succeeded in escaping through windows, hand-to-hand
encounters following as they reached the ground.
There were many casualties.
The invariable rule with all these Prussian-
ised bodies is that where they are strong they
oppress, as the Germans did in Belgium for
so many years, and where they are weak they
have to submit to oppression, as the Ger-
mans are now doing- at the hands of the
French. At about the time the New Jersey
Klansmen were being maltreated by angry
citizens, a number of Korean citizens were
being similarly dealt with at the hands of.
Japanese Ku Kluxers. According to the
Japan Chronicle (21/10/’23) :
The chief perpetrators of the massacre which
followed the earthquake were the Vigilantes, recruited
chiefly from the Young Men’s Societies, those semi-
militarist organisations so earnestly encouraged by
the Government. The police are represented in the
Japanese native press as having done their best to
protect the Koreans, and we have no reason to doubt
that they did so, for the most part. Fourteen Korean
laborers who were accommodated in the lockup in
the police-station at Fujioka, Gumma prefecture, for
their own protection were murdered in no less shock-
ing- manner on September 3. Hearing of the fact
that tne Koreans, who were in the employ of a local
contractor, were accommodated in the police-station,
13 representatives of the local young men’s associa-
tion visited the station and demanded that they ne
surrendered to them. The police refused. Over' 200
men, who soon gathered, made a raid upon the politer
station, and began wrecking the lockups, in which
the Koreans were. Meantime someone brought a
key which he had snatched from a policeman, and
the crowd rushed into the lockup. Some of the
terrified Koreans managed to climb up the roof of
the building in an attempt to escape, but they were
soon caught, and they, with all others, were killed
with spears, swords and other weapons.
The two cases illustrate why it is such a
heinous crime in English law to organise for
the enforcement of the law. Bodies so formed
usually give the authorities no trouble while
things are normal, and tlieir expressed rea-
sons for coming into existence are always
of the highest; but the moment a crisis
arises they have either to be protected, owing
to their weakness, or being strong they com-
mit as many crimes as the most reckless
bandits. A civilised State is a League of
Nations in little—a collection of conflicting-
interests which have agreed for their com-
mon comfort to abide by an elaborate set of
rules, interpreted by a trusted authority. The
introduction of a militant unit whose aim is
to usurp the functions of that authority is
a reactionary step that can do no good, and
may lead to anarchy.
•
Railways and Reconstruction.
A spasm of anger shook the top side of
N. S. Wales when the Sydney Parliament's
Works Committee turned down every pro-
posal for a railway in those parts, on the
mocking pretence that it couldn’t be sure the
proposed works would pay. It was an un-
seemly jest, for railways in districts that
lie in the direct orbit of Sydney, and which
it: is known won't pay, are started quite
casually, it being stated that the loss is esti-
mated at so much, but that a counterbalanc-
ing advantage will be gained through the
opening of certain rocks for settlement and
the making of certain stumps available in
the march of progress. Thus the Blacktown-
Riehmond line, which has proved itself cap-
able of losing over £409 per mile inside a
year, is being carried into the Ivurrajoug
Hills and left there. With this and a dozen
similar jobs in view, the Northerners didn’t
take seriously the idea that the Works Com-
mittee made it a virtuous and solid rule-
not to recommend works unless they are sure
to pay, and that all proposed connections
through the rich lands between the table-
land and the coast were turned down with
hardly a glance on that account. Rather
they leaned to the theory that it was just the
old game of keeping the North empty and
unprogressive, lest by becoming prosperous
k should secure enough electoral power to
vote its own separation. “Better is a deso-
lation belonging to N. S. Wales than a
wealthy province belonging to itself and to
Australia,” is how the case might be put.
So the Northerners became enraged, but
whether they have the staying power to re-
main enraged is another matter. There is
talk of refusing to pay State income-tax, and
Sydney Telegraph described this as “savage
threats,” just as if Kempsey and Goff’s
Harbor had sent out scalping parties. But
unless the district organises a Government
of its own, and pays taxes to it, and with-
draws its members from the old House in
Macquarie-street (supposing they will come)
the mere l’efusal to pay State income-tax
won’t do much good. Australia has a genius
for strikes about petty matters, but not over
big affairs. Incidentally, papers and politi-
cians of the old brand reproach the Northern-
ers for not accepting the decisions of the
A orks Committee like good sportsmen; and
there might be something in this if the
Committee were a trained and independent
judicial body. Being simply some fortuitous
politicians, selected for temporary duty out
of a discredited Legislature, and liable to
all the mean motives, the outside dictation
and the sliding panels of the parent body, it
doesn’t command much save suspicion.

Propagation of the Unfit,
“Country Peil”: I have had the heart-
breaking task of trying to teach four half-
starved, stunted, quarter-dressed mentally-
deficient children, who live in squalor and
dirt, sleeping in heaps to keep warm. A
luxury to them is a tin of jam, and they
usually get a little meat once a week. There
are five more children coming on, and good-
ness knows how many more to be. The
father is a wheat farmer with a holding of
only 20 acres; in his spare time he fills up
the holes in the roads. His wife is as weak
mentally as he is. Now I have been tracing
back the school records of this family on
the father’s side. His father and two of his
uncles are still living. Each is of obviously
stunted mental growth. One has spent some
time in an asylum for the insane. Be-
tween them they have had 30 children. Of
these 28 have attended school; and of the
whole lot only four obtained the old stand-
ard certificate—not a very high attain-
ment, as a fifth-grade average child
could now win it easily. One gained
her merit certificate at the age of 17,
three years later than the normal age.
The few smarter members of the three fami-
lies have left the district, fending success-
fully for themselves. The remainder have
stopped on the farms with the old folks, and
without doubt all are mentally deficient.
Some are worse than the father of nine
whom I began with. Suppose that the three
progenitors had been segregated, what a lot
of misery would have been eliminated, and
what a lot the State would have saved! Cer-
tainly the cost to the State has been little
so far—but wait! I know what the grand-
children are like, none better. What will
the great-grandchildren be? And that’s
when the State will be paying for its supine-
ness in not insisting upon the segregation,
or even sterilisation, of the mentally deficient.
Forty years ago was the right time to start ;
but it is not too late even now.

Rinderpest?
From a man out of Africa:—
A Westralian report has it that rinderpest has
broken out in the Fremantle district. About 17
years ago, surra, another deadly stock disease, was
“discovered” in the same State, and the diagnosis
wasn’t corrected till an enterprising sceptic had
bought the “infected’’ herd (Central Asian camels)
cheap—he sold at an immense profit. If there
hasn’t been another blunder the Fremantle outbreak
is of serious import to Australia. What rinder-
pest means to a country no one who has not seen it
i aging can realise. In spite of Koch’s serum it -s
still one of the greatest dangers with which S’African
stock-raisers are faced. In the days of the Dutch
Republics, when every farmer saw the will of
God in the pestilence, the method of treatment was
mostly direct inoculation with the gall of an infected
beast. This, as often as not, like “salting” with
a bit of diseased lung for pleuro-pneumonia, killed
the beast by blood-poisoning. The Dopper couldn’t,
oi wouldn t, understand the meaning of quarantine or
isolation cordon, and the great native tribes, with their
hordes of cattle, were even more difficult. On top r.f
that was the fact that nearly all the S’African wild
animals, especially the buck, were as open to infec-
turn as cattle. The great wave of rinderpest that,
m 1896, swept through the sub-continent like a
flame through dry grass, nearly wiped out the buck
and other wild animals from the Zambesi to the Fish
River. The mortality among the cattle was almost
as bad. Infectious in the highest degree, rinderpest

will run through a herd of cattle in an hour. Dropped,
sweating ears, lowered head and running eyes are
the first: symptoms. Death follows in an hour or
two. At Klerksdorp, late in 1902, there was an
outbreak among thousands of military stock located
on the common and farms about the towns. I was
inspector of military stock, and of vets, there were
none. The jyoch serum giving out, we inoculated
with gall from fresh beasts, mixed with glycerine,
killed all beasts showing symptoms and isolated
those apparently unaffected. There were about 500
niggers for the rough stuff, arid the job of keeping
them up to the burning in hot weather with no fuel
hut green blue-gum poles from the local plantations
—plus a little coal commandeered from the railway—
was a heartbreaker. We lost about 70 p.c. that
time, and other districts weren’t so lucky. If the
Westralian diagnosis is confirmed, the worst danger
will arise from the pest being communicated to the
native animals. But, like horses, donkeys and dogs,
they may prove immune.
Gratuity Bonds and a Safe Gamble.
A flood of Hughes’s pre-election p.n.’s will
require to be met on May 31, 1924, when the
war-gratuity bonds fall due. Four years
ago the small, unreliable person explained
through his hat that bonds would be
cashed “as the German indemnity comes
along” : but no German indemnity has come
along, so the burden of finding the money
has to be shouldered by his successors. And
the burden is heavy. At the close of the
last financial year the war gratuity commit-
ments amounted to £27,286,613, 'of which
£21,524,539 had been issued in bonds, cer-
tain beneficiaries receiving cash. Bonds
amounting to £8,016,058 have been redeemed
in necessitous cases, mostly with money bor-
rowed (more or less compulsorily) from the
banks. Roughly, the Government has to dig
up £19,000,000 for the redemption of uncan-
celled bonds and the repayment of bank
loans; and its accumulated surplus is about
£11,500,000 short; besides, £2,500,000 of the
surplus has been earmarked for Defence ex-
penditure. According to various bad prece-
dents it may (1) borrow the money in Lon-
don, which, in the circumstances, would be
the dead limit of indecency, (2) launch an-
other big flotation on the horribly congested
local market, or (3) extract what is required
from the banks, which are seriously restrict-
ing overdrafts (and that means private
enterprise and employment) already. A
better way than any would be to issue £lO
premium bonds for the amount required.
These bonds would bear interest at 2i p.c..
payable annually, and another 21 p.c. p.a.
would be devoted to the periodical redemp-
tion of bonds drawn by lot, with premiums
that would make a Tattersall’s prize-list
look cheap. For example, if the issue
totalled £12,000,000 and annual drawings
were decided upon, £300,000 would be avail-
able for distribution in the first year. Most
of the Diggers who have kept their gratuity
paper would be glad to convert it into
interest-bearing bonds, entitling them to a
recurring chance of winning a fortune with-
out sacrificing the principal. The balance
could easily be got from the multitudinous
clas' that likes a flutter on the racecourse,
or ii Tatt.’s or the Golden Casket; and for
the most part loses its money uselessly. In-
deed, one of the strongest arguments in favor
of introducing premium bonds into Australia
is that they would promote thrift among the
unthrifty.
The statement of General Monash that Aus-
tralia is armed for a one-day scrap or less
naturally led Bowden, the country’s mili-
tary and naval authority, to protest against
pessimism. Well, the Federal Statistician,
who gives figures but no comments, deals with
part of the case in his latest volume. At the
end of ’22 the permanently employed mili-
tary forces, including the Duntroon cadets,
numbered 2073, of whom the largest num-
ber concentrated in one spot seemed to be
556. There were some 12,000 retired officers
on the reserve list, all busy getting older and
dying-out. There were also 373 chaplains,
and 35,000 citizen soldiers, which latter
undergo a minimum of training; but the
2073, with 3780 sea-going sailors added,
apparently composed the force which was to
hold the fort (a whole continent and some
islands) while a real army was being got
together and organised. In 1914 there was
plenty of time to organise, for the British fleet
held the sea, and it wasn’t till the war was
nearly nine months old that Australia got into
“holts” (and not single-handed, then) with
any crowd of tlio enemy worth alluding to.
The possibility to be considered is that the
amazing luck may not last, and that on the
next occasion the time for organisation and
mobilisation may be nine days or less. Aus-
tralia would then have to fight with a very
raw, improvised army, even assuming that the
army didn’t have its throat cut while it was
hunting for its boots so that it could go out
and begin to improvise; and it is difficult
to remember when that kind of force has
done much good against well-equipped regu-
lars under decent leadership.
Maokii.and contains 103,568 square miles, so
it is rather larger than Victoria and about
one-third the size of N.S.W. P»ut as it has
aimed steadily at a general diffusion of popu-
lation it is short of congested cities and
slums. It has nearly twice the population of
Queensland, 21 times the population of S.
Australia, and more than three times that of
Westralia. Yet its biggest city, Auckland,
with 12 adjacent boroughs, isn’t nearly so
large as Brisbane or Adelaide, and only beats
Perth by a head. There are four cities of
fair size, ranging from Auckland, near the
top of the North Island, to Dunedin, near
the bottom of the South one. The capital,
located in the centre, contains SS6 out of
every 10,000 inhabitants, whereas Adelaide
was last reported as having 5267, Melbourne
5136, and the Australian capitals as an
average 4424 out of 10,000. An ambition to
bring a railway to every port, and to develop
the same, is partly responsible for the fact
that the local Year Book enumerates 17 ports
where oversea vessels come and go. Aus-
tralia isn’t exactly built for that sort of thing,
but when account is taken of such jealously-
closed or systematically-discouraged harbors
as Bowen, Gladstone, Port Stephens, Jervis
Bay, Twofold Bay and Portland, to say
nothing of the Clarence, which should be as
good a proposition as the Brisbane and
other samples, it is certain that Australia is
built for much better things than it has
accomplished.

One of the resolutions adopted at the Re-
turned Soldiers and Sailors’ Conference in
Hobart embodied
the suggestion of
the Brisbane
branch that the
trade, in moving
pictures should be
conducted on the
50-50 principle,
every foreign coun-
try sending a film
to Australia being
obliged to take an
Australian film in
return. Moved by
James Cornell, a
Westralian M.L.C.,
it was carried
nem. con. by Dig-
gers from the six
States. During the
same week a Good
Film League was
formed in Hobart,
the Anglican Bis-
hop of that city
stressing the
necessity for more
Australian a n d
fewer American
photo-plays; and a
conference of
Westralian show’-
men, while pro-
testing against the
50-50 proposal,
promised preferen-
tial support to
worth-while Aus-
tralian produc-
tions. Also, a com-
pany which is tak-
ing over a number
of Sydney cinema
theatres announced
its intention of
going in for film-
making in a pretty
big way. All this
signifies that public
opinion is harden-
ing against the ex-
ploitation of this
Commonwealth by
coarse and illit-
era t e foreigners
who, favored by a
scandalously low
rate of duty, dump
their beastly pro-
ductions on the
Australian market,
and whose Austra-
lian profits are in-
famously under-taxed. It signifies, also, that
Australians are surfeited with Los Angeles
themes, and are hungry for bright pictures
of their own land and life. When the Gov-
ernment makes dumping unhealthy the de-
mand will he supplied.

In its comments on the British general elec-
tion the once lofty and arrogant Foreign-
trade press of Sydney is a very small lion
with a very mild roar. The fact that Britain
is on the verge of scrapping the Cobden
superstition is a bitter pill the size of a foot-
ball. The figures from the Cold Country
just before the cold weather set in were worse
than they had been. The official unemployed
numbered 1,500,000, with the usual winter in-
crease in view. The amount spent on un-
employed relief since the close of the war
approached £500,000,000, and the situation
wasn’t improving. The trade figures showing
the stupendous influx of foreign goods of
the sort that Britain used to make, and the
visible presence of these goods everywhere
made it quite clear that if there were fewer
imports there would be more work, and dur-
ing five years of struggle no one revealed any
h reetrade way of reducing imports, nor any
way of providing more work without that
reduction. Nor did anyone explain why Pro-
tectionist countries which enjoy the same
internal peace as Britain have no such un-
employed problem. The chief asset of what
I’ oreign-trade press remains in Australia is
a melancholy silence, though the S. M.
Herald did rise the other day to say that
Protection is no remedy for unemployment,
because people who begin taking it can’t do
without it. The same thing might also be
said of food and its failure as a remedy for
ravenousness. The other day there resigned
from an Australian Upper House a gentle-
man who had tried food for 91 years, and
found it so lacking in finality as a cure for
hunger that he wanted it three times a day
even yet.

"D.”: The object of the Sydney University
Appointments Board, which has existed
since last year, is to place graduates and
undergrads in suitable jobs. “The Board,”
in the words of a circular now issued, “in-
vites commercial, industrial and other firms
to apply to the secretary when they have
vacancies which can be filled by young, alert
and well-educated men and women—raw
material which k would be - difficult to sur-
pass.’ As things are, it is an excellent pur-
RAISING THE DUST.
“The Victorian Cost of Living Commission, which is to inquire into every
phase of the question, has been hearing evidence for the jsis month on zhe
price of bread alone, and has gone on a country tour on the same matter.'
THE PUBLIC : “Fido, you’re scratching up a lot of dust into my
eyes."
pose; nevertheless, it does seem something
like a confession of failure that our univer-
sities should still be turning out human
material which, at the age of 20 or 21, and
often, more, is still “raw.” The culture which
is represented by a smattering of chemistry,
physics, mathematics, botany or geology might
surely be acquired in conjunction with some
calling which would represent an income to
the student from the moment of his departure
from the university. The old-time concep-
tion of a university as an institution for the
purely ornamental education of clerics and
the rich is rapidly passing. The ultimate
ideal of such places should be to turn out
young people who have superimposed upon
their grounding in general knowledge the
special knowledge required not merely in the
over-stocked professions of medicine and law,
but in the higher trades. There was more
money and fame in cabinet-making and fur-
niture-designing in 17th and 18th century
Europe than in, say, medicine, and the pro-
cesses connected with the production of
books held a high place in the popular esteem
of an earlier age. So it might be again it
our democratic universities aimed that way.
“Country Med.” talks to his lodge patients :
The papers in N. S. Wales have been recording
that some Friendly Societies are perturbed at the
B.M.A.’s refusal to reduce medical fees for juvenile.--
and single women. They don’t seem to be con-
cerned about the rates for single men, although
it is really they whose requirements are smallest
for drugs and attendance. Even at the present rate*
no doctor, when the absence of a chemist compel'
him to do his own dispensing, can wish to increase
his lodge list—that is, if he is sufficiently con-
scientious to hand out the same medicines to
“clubbies” and to private patients. A medico
with a large panel will only show a profit if he
uses drugs sparingly or not at all. Some years ago
i “did loeutns” in mining towns for a few of this
class, and well remember the numerous bottles filled
with nothing in particular with which 1 was invited
to regale lodge patients. In my own practice i
thank Heaven my list is very small. Under present
conditions one receives a fraction over tenpenee a
week for attending and providing drugs and dress-
ings for a member, his wife, male children under
14, and female children under 16. It is only neces-
sary for one member of a family to be ill to cut
out the 11s. per quarter in drugs alone. Witt)
single folk there may occasionally be a profit, but
frequently there are none such on the list. It may-
be asked why one takes lodge patients at all under
these conditions, I'he answer is that in a small
town one must do it to keep up one’s connection —
a refusal to accept club patients would entail the de-
fection of their non-club relatives to the opposition.
Given a reputable, conscientious medical-officer,
the lodges are on a wonderful wicket under present
conditions, and any agitation for further concessions
to junior members may lead to a counter-agitation
for a rise in the general rate. 1 do not always
agree with the heads of the B.M.A. ; but with a
full knowledge of the facts in this ease I take
my place in the ring.
"L’ip Tok” : During the war some hundreds
of thousands of pounds were subscribed by
the public to the various funds instituted to
help the Digger and bis dependants. Most
of this money has been used for the pur-
poses for which it was collected; but there
are still balances, amounting in all to sev-
eral thousands, lying dormant in banks
throughout Australia. Under the existing
laws this money can do nothing but accumu-
late interest. For instance, certain districts
—Vaucluse (Sydney) is a case in point—
subscribed money to be employed in alleviat-
ing distress among Diggers and their de-
pendants resident there. The returned men
of those districts are men in comfort-
able circumstances, or else they found no
difficulty in obtaining suitable employment
on their return from active service. The con-
trollers of funds like these are consequently
in a position similar to that of the machine-
gunner who has a plentiful ammunition sup-
ply but no visible target; for, the scope of the
fund being limited and definitely set forth,
the balance cannot be employed in Surry
Hills or Footscray, or handed over to such
concerns as the T.B. Soldiers’ Association.
The situation could be dealt with by the
Federal Parliament passing a short Act to
authorise all such unexpended balances to be
pooled and utilised for the welfare of Diggers
in general. A suggestion to this effect was
made to the Repatriation Department some
months ago, but so far no notice has been
taken of it.

“N 5 West” : Recently I entrusted to the
care of the Post Office an article worth
considerably over a month’s screw, which I
was under contract to deliver in a neighbor-
ing State. As I paid the fee for registra-
tion I felt fairly secure—till I received a
note Rom the Department asking me to call.
I was then regretfully informed that the re-
gistered mail had been pillaged, and that
my packet was missing. After I had signed
declarations as to value and nature of con-
tents, I learned that £2 was the most I
could recover. I was also told, again “re-
gretfully,” by the postal detective, that it
was a pity I had not insured the packet. As
I had to replace the lost article, I resolved
not to run the same risk again. But when
I endeavored to insure my second package.
I found that the Post Office does
not undertake insurance of matter except to
certain overseas countries —Britain, U.S.A.,
Argentine, etc. —and I also found that not
one insurance company of the dozen or so
I tried would take the business. I have since
been informed by the P.M.G. (with mote
“regrets”) that the Department had at vari-
ous times considered the matter of insuring
postal matter, but that it was impossible
because of the great distances, number of
handlings, etc., in Australia. Apparently it
is beyond the brain-power of our depart-
mental heads to devise a scheme of insurance
for letters and parcels consigned to places
within the Commonwealth, although if the
article is going to the other hemisphere it
becomes quite practicable.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Lloyd George, up against a problem which
calls for logic and reasoning power, shows
himself short of both. He assumes in the
best Freetrade style that Freetrade is a self-
evident truth like the old material hell, be-
cause every Country of importance save Bri-
tain will have nothing'to do with it, and Bri-
tain, the Lone Fisherman of the fiscal
waters, has the record unemployed problem
of the world. Some of his figures of speech,
about dead crabs and dogs with tins tied to
their tails, suggest a Bailey-Dooley-MeGirr
fuss at its best. And his most constant de-
mand is to know why Prime Minister Bald-
win doesn’t do something. “He has done
nothing but talk, talk, talk,” Shrilled little
David in one of his exalted moments. ‘What
we want is someone who will tackle the
job.’’ Baldwin became a Minister for the
first time two years ago, and has been Prime
Minister for a few months; Lloyd George
had 17 consecutive years of office, including
six as Prime Minister. He was dislodged
with difficulty and in a deuce of a temper,
bequeathing the unemployed to his successor,
who certainly has been acting with sufhcient
energy to make one little solicitor very mad.
Tired of being a target for critic and car-
toonist, McPherson has thrown up the Vic.
Treasurership after holding it in the Bowser,
Lawson and Lawson-Allan teams. His
nominal reason was the tendency of Min-
isters to spend beyond the Budget without
arranging for extra revenue; but colleagues
say that the amouuts were nothing to worry
about, and that McPherson, egged on by
somebody, determined to have a “curtain
that everybody would notice. He is going
for a trip to the Cold Land, anyhow, in
February, and as this would be his third
tour in six years he could hardly expect
leave. The last remnant of the Bowser
Economy party, McPherson did some fine
work in six years, but gradually be lost his
Hold on the House, the Cabinet and the
Country. “Praise God from Whom all bless-
ings flow” seemed to echo through the Ser-
vice when he resigned. He isn’t the sort of
Treasurer to suit the present generation,
which wants to jazz and blow the conse-
quences ! But he took a long while to rebel
and swallowed a whole string of camels be-
fore straining at his gnat.
The N.S.W. North Coast railway was
completed the other day, barring the missing
bridge over the Clarence and the gap at the
Queensland border. So there is an un-
broken run from Sydney to South Grafton,
anyhow. But the line doesn’t bring the
produce of the inland country to the coastal
towns, which is what the people ask; and
places due west from Lismore, from which
it wants to draw supplies, are 900 or 1000
miles awav by rail and boat when they might
be 150 miles by train. But the great new
work, which bugs the coast, is handy to
carry fish from one seaside place to an-
other, if people care to exchange fish. When
the gaps are filled in the Sydney-Brisbane
express is to fly like a haunted soul along
the new route, which is shorter and less
precipitous than the old one; but some
people hold that the new route is too casual,
and that a lot of strengthening and
straightening will be required on some long
stretches before any heavy express can eat
up time and space thereabouts.
Vic. Premier Lawson celebrated the resigna-
tion of McPherson by introducing a new
Railway Loan Bill, which will add £2,630,000
to the State debt and increase the annual
interest charge by £130,000. Furthermore,
he is talking of giving the civil service a
rise of about 13 per cent., and then there
are the proposed police pensions. It all
makes McPherson’s departure look more like
a national calamity.
“S.M.”: Treasurer McPherson, of Vic-
toria, resigned the other day because the
Cabinet promised new expenditures which
would have turned his little surplus into a
shortage. He declined to have a shortage on
his conscience. McPherson is a man of fine
distinctions. Up to June, 1922, his little
Stute had fooled away two millions more
loan money on the “purchase of land for
settlement” than the other five States put
together. It had blewed £23,000,000 on the
monstrous and jobful iniquity of buying
Jones’s farm at an impossible price (for its
competition skied prices), and putting
Brown on it loaded with an impossible debt,
while the other States spent £21,000,000
among them. The man who saw nothing to
complain of in that madness, and yet went
wild over one small deficit, should be called
McPharisee, by reason of his camel-eating
habits.
A CHANCE, ANYWAY.
BRITISH LABOR-LEADER HENDERSON : “There, that’s what Protection does. Makes
millionaires! ”
BRITISH WORKING-MAN : “ That’ll do me. I’d like his chance. I’m sick of a policy
that makes nothing hut poverty.”
Ramsay Macdonald, the British Labor
leader, says that preference would be a rea-
sonable policy for England if the Dominions
had an open door. Ramsay Macdonald and
British Labor may be thankful that the
Dominions haven’t got an open door. It
they had, not much British stuff would come
in through it.
This item appeared last week from little
Geelong (Vic.) :
There was not a vacant seat in the buyers gallery
at the Wool Exchange on Thursday, lhe sale was
most successful, the woollen mills of Britain, Aus-
tralia, United States, Japan, France, Canada, Norway,
Italy and Belgium being represented Tra walla
greasy merino fleece brought 40-id.
The world doesn’t flock to Geelong or any
other part of Australia to buy wheat, and
if it did it would probably offer no more for
a bushel of it than for lib. of sheep ,s over-
coat. Perhaps when the cotton industry gets
going good spenders from the ends of the
earth will rush for that also. Meanwhile
self-advertisers who weep about the space
wasted on the thankless jumbuek to the detri-
ment of grain- and hen-farmers should be
avoided till the financial sky is clearer.
Prohibition hits a country in queer and
unexpected places. Last year a million and
a third gallons of spirits were dispensed
under doctors’ orders in the L.fe.A., along
with an ocean of wine and sundries. That
a doctor can prescribe spirits has, of course,
added greatly to the value of a doctor’s
diploma; and naturally “colleges” have
sprung up to supply the demand. One fac-
tory in Kansas has, it is alleged, been turn-
ing them out by the hundred; and a cable
a few days ago alleged that its total now
reaches 25,000. It. wouldn’t matter so much
if they prescribed nothing but spirits; un-
fortunately to carry the fraud through they
have to prescribe drugs as well.
The fate of the Australia, one-time flag-
ship of the R.A.N., has been practically
settled. In accordance with the terms of
the Washington Treaty she must be de-
stroyed within the next few months. A sug-
gestion to fill the hull with concrete and use
it as a breakwater has been under considera-
tion ; but the scheme has been finally rejected
on the ground that such a breakwater would
be more of a menace than a protection, and
also in view of engineering difficulties. So
the ship to which Australia owed its safety
in the early days of the war will be taken
out and sunk a few miles off Sydney Heads.
Meantime the old warrior presents a pitiful
sight as he lies beside Garden Island, after
being in the hands of the dismantles for a
couple of months.
Philadelphia, the U.S. Quaker City, seems
to have degenerated from the broad hat-brims
of its fathers. The cable reports a brisk
week-end. Three hundred drunks were cap-
tured ; two were dead as the result of prohibi-
tion liquor, eight likely to die, and 40 very
bad, but hopeful. One exercised local
option in his cell, and committed suicide.
The Australian way of gradual reduction is
less nerve-racking. The other .day,, for in-
stance, the long, dry arm of Victorian law
ordered the closure at the end of the. year ot
26 more drinkeries in four metropolitan dis-
tricts alone —Abbotsford, Port Melbourne,
East Melbourne and Essendon. No suicide
resulted. Everybody will be compensated—-
out of the special tax levied on “the trade,”
which pays for its own funeral. Between
1906 and 1923 Victoria mislaid 1510 out of
an original 3521 pubs in this silent way.
By an amateur in augury:—
Ominous, from the Conservative viewpoint, is the
news from London that Newton Moore, ex-Premier
of Westralia, has. decided not to reeontest North
Islington as a supporter of the Government. Ominous
for the reason that Moore, though of no Parliamentary
consequence, is a cunning campaigner who doesn’t
believe in taking risks that may be avoided. Having
manceuvred himself into the Groperland Premiership
in 1906, he manoeuvred himself out four years later
on discovering that his party was likely to be de-
feated at the 1911 election and that his own seat
(Bunbury) was in danger. When the party was
smashed to smithereens the man who. e flabby leader-
ship had contributed to the disaster was well dug in
at the London Agency. From this post he emerged
during* the war to hold a cushy job on Salisbury
Plain, and to acquire a major-generalship, although
he had never been in action. Australian generals
being in the boom, the Conservatives ran him foi
St. George’s, Hanover-square, on G. H. Reid s death,
and then for North Islington, the other seat having-
been wiped out. North Islington used to be very
safe (Moore’s majority in 1918 was 10,183), but last
year the Conservative vote slumped to less than the
total of Liberal and Labor votes, and, unless the
middle-class London suburb warms to Tariff Reform,
a further slump is inevitable. At this juncture the
Major-General finds that he will be unable to stand,
having “urgent business in Canada.” It is a bad
aug-ury for Baldwin.
As a general rule Australian revenues show
a gratifying increase; but how far is this
only a matter of the local stock of paper-
money going in and out of the Treasury i
Tutankhamen is only half dead compared
with the official silence as to the amount or
real money in these swelling revenues real
money good to pay the interest on our
£400,000.000 of external debt. A doub e-
barrelled budget (gold and paper) after the
Brazilian fashion would make interesting
but possibly very disconcerting reading.
Prom an old Union secretary:
There is a lot of fake about these resolutions of
protest against the expulsion of Communists by the
Sydney A.L.P. Executive. In some cases the “pro-
tests” have been registered at meetings where theie
were not more than half a dozen unionists, small
flying gangs of Garden sympathisers working the
oracle. The executive is doing nothing to counter-
act these Red stunts; and therein it is blundering.
The publication of votes which may represent a
majority of one in a meeting of seven is apt to
produce the impression that the mass of Labor sup-
porters have Communist sympathies, which impres-
sion may cost Labor many votes when the elections
arrive.
Pressure is being brought to bear on
N S W.’s rather bogged Premier to pass some
legislation dealing with the “Ne Temere”
papal decree. The idea is welcome for various
reasons, one being that brisk movement is
good for Fuller. But the Protestant Federa-
tion would deserve still better of its country
if it would put its full weight behind a de-
mand for a sinking fund of, say, £1.000,00(1
a year, to start immediately and continue as
long as the debt does. The Scripture says
“Owe no man anything,” so there is nothing
more religious than a sinking fund, and every
church which fails to advocate one is a
withered branch and a barren fig-tree, like-
wise a valley of dry bones.
Once a week or so Sydney Telegraph de-
votes a half-page to some N.S.W. country
town —its progress, its prosperity, its pubs,
and especially its prospects. But it is heavy
going. In 30 years (1891-1921) the County
of Cumberland (which means Sydney and
suburbs) added 566,051 to its population.
Greater Newcastle gained 35,593. All the
other towns put together increased by 76 953.
In the circumstances the Telegraph finds
it far easier to talk of their pubs than their
progress.
A lot of people who declined to interest
themselves in public finance, and wlio
reckoned that it didn’t have anything to do
with them even if the State was borrowing-
hard and omitting to build up a sinking
fund, are feeling now that these things had
a lot to do with them. The banks, seeing
the size of the public 10U which is maturing
within the next few months, and realising
that they will be called upon to find the
money, if the public won’t, are buttoning up
tight. They can’t do anything else. They
have to be prepared to meet the States’ de-
mands. So people who are badly in need of
accommodation can’t get it; and in many
cases labor which would be employed if
money were available has to be set adrift.
Despairing of shoving through his pro-
gramme before Christmas, Vic. Premier Law-
son will ask Parliament to adjourn from
the second week of December till March.
Then he will wind up with a Redistribution
of Seats Bill. The Hayseed organisation is
to determine in March whether it will allow
its Parliamentary nominees to have anything
further to do with Liberalism. Meantime,
a three-months’ spell will be heartily wel-
comed by Lawson, Allan and the rest after
the troublesome time they have had lately.
When the Sydney City Council goes to
sleep upon a proposed job its snores cost
money. The widening of Park-street was
projected in 1912 ; but the council baulked.
Resumptions would have cost £120,000 then.
To-day to mop up one side of the street will
run to £584.000; the other side '<'■ Idn’t be
got for less than £872,000. The cou 1 can’t,
however, decide which side it wants, and it
is computed that every day's delay adds
approximately £lOO to the bill.
“Bildfid” : In the latter days of Hughes a
reward of £50,000 was offered for the dis-
covery of a real oil-well —-a “gusher,” not
some drops of grease floating on a dam, nor
a hole with a small deposit which is mixed
with soap and still has the importer’s label
sticking to it. Nothing much has resulted
except cats. Now Australia has over 393
million pounds of debt falling due in six
years, and it might be good business if the
seven Governments offered £75,000, with a
second prize of £25,000. for a sure and not
ruinously-expensive method of meeting this
mighty shock. I am willing to compete my-
self.
HIS LEADER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“You are my leader, much to my sorrow.” — Mr.
Molesuorth to Mr. Lang in. the N.S.W. Assembly.
You ain’t the sort of bloke I would have chose
To follow to a pie-stall or a bar ;
1 wouldn’t partner you at dominoes
Or trust your judgment on a cheap cigar.
You rouse in me no feeling but dislike;
But solidarity’s the Labor motto,
And, though it gives me what you term the spike,
t follow you because —because (Oh, strike
Me pink!) I’ve got to.
You sit in front. Don’t get it in your mind
The fact ensures you my respect and trust- —
if Satan’s self were there I’d sit behind.
Because, according to the rules, I must.
Of politicians quite a lot you need
To make a party, as of stones a grotto.
You are the Dux, majority-decreed.
1 bow to the decision. Yes, indeed!
My oath! I’ve got to.
You hold the reins—a fact I much lament,
Regarding you, quite candidly, askance:
Nathless I recognise to that extent
You have a claim on my allegiance—-
God send I never kick the traces o’er.
Meanwhile ’tis some relief to mention sotto
Voee that vour promotion I deplore,
And asking your directions galls me sore,
Albeit I’ve got to.

Last year was a record one for the T. and G.
Ihe outstanding features of the accounts
are ('L) the increase of total annual in-
come from £1,642,680 to £1,889,028; (2)
the .growth of funds by £955,196 to
t0,448,8_0; and (3) the record volume of
new business in both Ordinary and Indus-
h‘branches. In the Ordinary department
11 ew policies assuring more than 4!
Jw.i'eiLS were completed and in the Industrial
99,164 policies for £4,639,112. The T. and
<i. has been so active in seeking business in
recent years that income in both depart-
ments lias more than doubled in five years •
in that short period the society has grown
as big again as it was at the close of its
4lnd year. Measured by funds the expan-
sion has been greater; in 1918 tliev
e^uiS'io^ 891 ' 566 ' and at September 30 last
£6,443,820. Last year's speeding-up in
writing new business might have been ex-
pected to increase the expense rates,
but the next table shows that the costs p.c.
of income in the Ordinary department were
smaller than for four years past, and in the
Industrial branch the lowest on record

The T. and G., according to its published
accounts, is writing its new Ordinary poli-
cies much more cheaply than some of its
big competitors do. Charging old business
with 7 p.c. of renewal premium income, and
assuming the balance of expenses to be
chargeable to new business, then the T. and
G- s £102,504 of first premiums last year
were harvested at a cost of £98,317. That
works out at 74 p.c., and practically the
same as for the previous year. How the
1. and G. does it the ‘"Wild Cat” cannot
explain, but it is rather an extraordinary
Performance in view of new-business rates
running up to 100 p.c. in other old-
established, big offices.
The lower cost of running the Industrial
branch is a particularly pleasing feature of
5® eo J 14 operations. Last year it was
xT J-os. bd. p.c. less than only nine years
ago, and on present income that represents
an annual saving of more than £53,000. That
X i °L hnportance to policy-holders, because
the 1. and G. is a mutual office and pays
bonuses on Industrial as well as Ordinary
policies. Of course, Industrial cannot expect
to get so much by way of bonus as Ordi-
nary policy-holders, who put tbe manage-
ment to a minimum of expense. Last year,
lor instance, though Ordinary income was
almost £400,000 smaller than Industrial, the
former branch showed a surplus of £130,190
(that is, funds in excess of estimated obliga-
tions under policies) compared with £67,458
in the Industrial branch. The allocation of
these surpluses gave Ordinary bonuses rang-
ing from 40s. per £lOO of whole-life assur-
ance one year in force to 665. for a policy
-- .rears in force, and from 30s. to 565. p.c.
lor endowment policies; in the Industrial
branch, the equivalent of 10 weeks’ premiums
on policies over five years and up to 10
years in force, 20 weeks’ premiums up to 20
years, and 30 weeks' premiums over 20
years.

Ordinary payments under policies last year
were: By death, £46,903; endowments
matured, £56,145 ; surrenders, £93,504 In-
dustrial : Death claims. £85.283 ; endowments
£70.133; surrenders, £47,818. Altogether
£417,253 was paid away against £176,704 in
1914; but so much new business has been
introduced that the ratio of claims to pre-
mium income has been practically halved in
the Industrial section, and is several points
lower in the Ordinary branch. Ten rears'
ago the society inaugurated a nursing service
for policy-holders, which is claimed to have
‘proved of great benefit, and has. undoubtedly,
had the effect of reducing the rate of mor-
tality." It is going a step further now, and
inviting holders of Ordinary policies for
£5OO and more to undergo a free medical
examination every five years. "The policy-
holder will be told if he still remains a
first-class life; if not, he will be advised to
consult his own medical attendant, for whom
the full results of the Society's medical
referee’s examination will be made available."
T- i™'* p- (I . oe s not intend to fall foul
ot the 8.M.A.; its medical staff will not
treat the policy-holder—“such action
would be infringing on the sphere of the
policy-holder’s own doctor.” It is a splendid
scheme, and should benefit both policy-
holders and the society.
Owing to the rapid growth of funds and
higher interest rates the T. and G.’s invest-
ment branch produced £320.684 last rear
compared with £271.041 for 1922 ' and
£228.443 for 1921. This shows the im-
provement in the investment rate:—

luist year’s return was just 15s. p.c. better
than that of 1914. and on last year’s average
hinds of slightly under six millions the im-
provement put £44.750 more into the till for
the 12 months. The management took full
advantage of the opportunity of investing
in Government securities, and leaned on its
bankers to get the gilt-edged holdings.
Twelve months ago public securities totted
up £4.385405, and there was an overdraft
for £214,538. At September 30 last the
bank account was down to £30,560, and pub-
lic securities had increased to £5,203,367.
That was more than three-fourths of the
balance-sheet total. Here are further com-
parisons :

since the T. and G. had a foreclosed prop-
erty on its hands.

This big softgoods-warehouse co. has made
a splendid recovery from the troubles it ex-
perienced when it was heavily loaded with
expensive stocks and values crashed The
£4</nnn "n tie past 12 months—giving
£4O 000-odd more than was required for
pref. divs. and 10 p.c. on ordinaries—were
tiie more remarkable because others in

ing the effects ot the collapse of prices and
the absence of buyers. Evidently Robert

During Ellis’s 1921 and 1922 financial years
the bmlding trade was quiet, so profits ‘were
small. • There was a revival last year, so the
co. did much better. However, as £3907
"’ a s taken from reserves to pay an average
oi t!| p.c. for the previous two years, the dis-
tribution on this occasion has been limited
to 6 p.c. so that £1239 could be replaced.
W lien trading prospects brightened the man-
agement bought stocks heavily, but the turn-
over was not quite so large as had been ex-
pected. and at the balance the accumulation
amounted to £14.619 more than 12 months
back. Two months after the accounts closed
i P i reported that stocks were
healthy and carefully valued, and that good
contracts in hand assured a continuance of
profitable trading. At the present moment,
however, the trade is somewhat disturbed —
m Sydney, especially —-<111 “honorable under-
standing among retailers having fallen
through. A few years ago the directors
increased paid capital from £75,000 to
£lOO,OOO by an issue of shares at par and
laid out the money in new timber areas and
equipment; that section of the business, how-
ever, did hot do too well last year owing to
the drought. Another effect of last year's
brisker trade was an increase of book debts,
and to finance customers and earn- large
stocks liabilities increased £35,660 to £64.445 ;
£13,644 of the total was bank overdraft and’
the balance was owing to sundry creditors.

llie feature of the comparisons is that the
nook value of fixed assets at August 31 last
was only £2300 larger than nine years ago,
despite all the extensions of interests during
that period; but whether the heavy writing-
down has provided for something more than
the necessary depreciation of properties and
plant is not disclosed. Visible reserves assist-

The problem of irrigation for arid regions is
closely bound up with that of cheap conveyance of
water. Here again Pioneer Wood Pipe fills the bill,
giving entire satisfaction when kept constantly full
of water. The pipe can be placed underground below
plough cleptn, cutting off ail waste by evaporation,
or where it is not required, as well as saving
right-of-way expense. Laterals can easily be run
from main pipe and connected with taps, thus deliver-
ing water to any desired point. Or when pumping
is required its economy and greater carrying capa-
city again indicate the use of Pioneer Wood Pipe.

Gillies does the impossible again by achiev-
ing what is practically an embargo on 1
ports of carbide. Of course, the Tasmania 1
Government has helped him. The Speck s
finances are in a mess, and somebody saw
that something might be got out of the
£lOO,OOO locked up in Gillies s Nor-West
Bay works. IV beat the foreign stuff and
supply the Australian market at the Pro-
mised £25 a ton, Gillies must . duplicate his
furnaces. No cash for him will come fiom
the market, but if the dumper is kept at
!>;rv stocks on hand can be sold and the need-
ful got in that way. It took six months
deliberation and! much Tariff Board prodding
to get Minister Chapman to grant Gillies a
clear market. Having got it both he and
the Speck ought to be done with muddling

Christmas Gift, Cootamundra (N.S.W.),
has turned out a rogue-elepliant. At present
the co. has a few men burrowing at the
300 ft. level in the hope of finding some of
the quartz that seemed strong in the winze
50ft. below the 200 ft. level, but the quest
has given a blank. Here and there the
.vails are visible, but the filling is no good.

Unless the tunnels tap the reef very soon,
the Crown (N.S.W.) is “sent for.” The
north tunnel is 102 ft. into barren hillside,
and the south tunnel is in 116 ft. with similar
luck. L. Hansen, of the Ajax North, must
be getting anxious, as he “saw no reason why
the reef and values should not live at depth.’
The Mudgee country has not achieved noto-
riety for deep gold-reefing; but the deeper
values of Hill End were used by the entiiu-
siasts to buttress the case for the Crown.

Bridge-street is placing on the market
Sutherland’s Lode G. M. Co., three miles
from Kiandra (N.S.W.). The coldest spot
in Australia was'the scene of an alluvial rush
in 1860-61. when a population of 15,000
braved the blizzards and recovered 60,0000 z.
iu six months and 150,0000 z. inside two
years. The alluvial was shallow, as were
the several reefs disclosed, but the mother
reef may have been overlooked. In a booklet
published in 1901, Geologist E. C. Andrews
abandoned hope of deep quartz, and de-
scribed the shallow reefs tested as being of
poor appearance. The lode being worked
by J. S. Sutherland is different. It consists
of iron pyrites,! and has widened as he
followed it from the surface to 69ft., where
it is 23ft. thick. Port Keinbla has just
treated seven tons for oyer 3oz. to the ton.
The proposed co. is in 200,000 4s. shares, of
which 133,350 are contribs. at 2s. down;
and 66,650 paids along with £3500 in cash
go to the vendors. C. It. MacKenzie, late
of the C.S.A. and Cobar Tinto, has handed
in a report on the prospects.

At the Bribbaree, on the Stockinbingal-
Forbes railway (N.S.W.), they are sinking
a winze below the 130 ft. level. At 12ft.
there is 15in. of quartz carrying gold, which
is an improvement. When 50ft. has been
sunk, prospects will determine mining policy.
Meantime Pitt-street is watching and wait-
ing for something which will enable it to
unload at a premium of Is. or so on the
2s. shares.

The Selwyn (N.Q.) deposits of cobalt
must rank now as easily the most important
in Australia. The metal was found at Car-
coar (N.S.W.) in ’B9; also at Port Mac-
quarie in that State, and there was a small
find at South Blinman (S.A.). But the
total Australian export up to 1920 amounted
in value to little over £10,000; and Selwyn
in full swing will make those figures look
very sick. The ore is the cobalt bloom
(erythine), and the only impurity (arsenic)
is a valuable by-product.
A number of dredging claims have been
taken up at Mount Garnet (N.Q.), and a
Melbourne syndicate is doing a good deal of
prospecting. Byron Moore recently arrived
or, the field to conduct farther exploration.
The old Vulcan, at Irvinebauk (N.Q.), is
having another life, and is producing payable
ore at a good rate. A September crushing
of 99 tons gave 8i tons black tin worth
£960. The west stope at No. 3 level is
hefty; and a large body of ore has been
struck at the end of the stope in No. 1
level. It is anticipated that between these
two levels there will be a record output
before the end of the year. The State bat-
tery is due to commence on a 200-ton crush-
ing from the No. 3 level. But unless rain
comes-shortly this crushing will just about
cut out the water supply. A fair amount of
stuff has been coming into this battery. The
rich shoot on which the Lucky Hit party
has been working for the past three months
is still in the face. This show is an easy
first in the list of rich crushings; the Sep-
tember returns from 12 tons gave 3[ tons
of black tin worth £432.
A subsidy of £l5OO on the £ per £ plan
having been granted to Clark’s Gold Mine,
Charters Towers, Billy Clarke has been m
Brisbane paving the way for shareholders
to respond to the tune of 4d. a share. The
Towers scripholders are almost enthusiastic.
It has been decided to sink the underlie an-
other 100£t. if sufficient support, is forth-
coming in Brisbane; Clarke’s theory is that
another pay-shoot is due at 50ft. or there-
abouts* where a junction may be expected.
Brisbane scripholders held back a bit, but
will probably see it through.
*■* * *
Bowen Consolidated Coal, which opened
on the 7ft. Garrick seam, is sinking the
mainshaft to the Bowen seam, from which
the State mine is doing so well. The Bowen
in this part of the field gives a thickness of
anything from 10ft. to 20ft., most of it pro-
viding a workable section of hard coal which
cokes decently but is on the high side in
ash. The Garrick is good coal, but won’t
stand much handling; and as there is no
prospect of coke works for years yet on the
field, the Consolidated Co. should do better
out of the lower seam.
* * * *
No. 4 North Phoenix, Gympie, had a nice
little crushing last month, 45 tons yielding
3470 z. gold. There have been no develop-
ments of note underground. The 784 ft.
workings are showing a very small reef with
occasional patches of good specimen stone.
Any big tonnage seems impossible for the
time being.
* * * *
Lander Oil Co. started operations on its
Orallo bore on the 22nd inst., and Minister
A. J. Jones, accompanied by 11. I. Jensen,
went up to perform the opening ceremony.
The plant is now running three shifts on
the rotary system, and. barring accidents,
two or three months will see it down to the
spot where the oil is expected.
The Scorpius, Herberton, is still on good
ore, the shoot being 6ft. wide, and there
will probably be 30ft. in it on the level. The
October clean-up for the Great Northern
produced 84 tons of cones, from 80 tons ore,
worth £lOOO. Providing the co. is not held
up for water good crushings can be anti-
cipated from this mine. It has been doing
a lot of dead work lately.
* * * *
The Mt. Isa field (Q.) is badly bit for
water. Although there has been a consider-
able number of arrivals at Cloneurry mak-
ing for the field, the position is awkward
for newcomers, as camps have been moved to
water some seven or eight miles from the
central leases; and things have slowed down
in consequence.
* * *’ *
When business is slack in Westralian Par-
liament, the favorite recreation of members
is to throw mud at the Bullfinch mine and
railway. Found in 1910, Bullfinch imme-
diately began to produce tens of thousands
of pounds’ worth of gold, and promised to be
a wonder. A disturbance at shallow depth,
however, spoilt it, but the big low-grade lodes
in its northern workings enabled the mine to
go on turning out gold for years, and con-
tributed largely to its total yield of £BOO,OOO.
The railway from Southern Cross cost
£60,000, and, according to the railway autho-
rities, did not pay. Nevertheless, the Gov-
ernment derived a lot of revenue from lease
rents, sale of town lots, etc. The field kept
150 men employed for 12 years, maintained
a small township during that period, paid
£150,000 in dividends, distributed £300,000
among merchants, and handed the Govern-
ment a large amount for railway charges
and water. As usual, however, it was
assumed that the mines would go on for
ever, so amortisation was not provided for.
Incidentally, it was the Chaffinch venture,
not the Bullfinch, which gave the field its bad
name.
* * *
Crow’s Nest (W.A.) is again producing.
This show looked so well a couple of years
ago that a syndicate of some of the cutest
mining men in Perth and Kalgoorlie bought
a controlling interest and put the whole thing
into a small co. Good crushings were
obtained down to 100 ft. or so, and then the
shoot went wrong. It has apparently righted
itself a bit in deeper ground, as an ounce
return worth over £2OOO has jnst been
obtained. But it is in a locality where reefs
and lodes can’t be relied on for a foot ahead.
Sons of Gwalia’s first clean-up from the
new plant was rather low grade, but most
of the stuff treated was taken from the bins,
where it had been lying since the fire which
burnt the old mill in 1920. With selective
methods higher returns are promised. The
co. continues to cyanide its mountainous
pile of old tailings at the rate of 10,000 tons
a month, but the profit is small.
Adelaide has formed a no-liability co. to
take over the Orinda. at Ora Banda (W.A.),
and already favorable reports are_ being
used as a pretext for a gamble in _ the
shares. Good returns may be obtained
from time to time, but the show as thus far
developed is not important.
Misfortune seems to dog Ives Reward
( W.A.). Now it is announced that the new
power plant to operate the rock drills won’t
do the work, and that “the contractors have
decided to instal another.” As The Bul-
letin has said more than once, the show
wants both capital and brains. Without
them its chances are small.
* * * *
Lake View Investments were bought on
the London Stock Exchange the other day
up to 16s. In June last the Board stated
that, in view of the brightened prospects of
Burma Corporation, in which the co. holds
a big interest, the payment of half-yearly
dividends rvould probably be started early in
1924. One is tipped for next month.
Part of Westralia’s Empire Exhibition gold
exhibit has been on show in Perth. Rich
lumps of gold-ore, plaster casts of famous
old nuggets' and the real article in the case
of some of the newer ones were placed on
view, and the whisper that plenty of gold was
known to still exist in the State’s reefs and
lodes induced the members of a visiting
theatrical co. to load up with shares in more
than one doubtful venture. Some fine speci-
mens of copper, tin, coal and other minerals
were also on exhibition, and a placard to
the effect that Westralia produced more gold
than the rest of Australia was tacked on the
wall. But it is quite possible that this
odious comparison won’t be allowed to figure
in the Australian mineral court.
* * * *
Oswald’s, working shallow ground, finds
that so little good stone was left in the east
spur reef by the old hands that the block
has been cut out. All the stone is gone
from above the 900 ft. level, but a winze from
it has followed a nice run gold for 82ft.
The vein varies from 2in. to 6ft., and it
provides the reason why the 1000 ft. level
is to be straightened up so as to let the
shoot be stoped overhead. So hard pressed
was the co. for stone last half-year that it
could break only 1900 tons for the battery.
With the aid of the cyanide plant and tail-
ings it got lieioz., but this didn’t pay.
Oswald’s shareholders had a div. all the
same, because in good times cash balances
were built up.
* * * *
Geologist Baragwanath’s report on the. Glen-
elg River seepage (Vic.) made that soak smell
something like sulphuretted hydrogen. There
seem to be some points of resemblance be-
tween it and the Leongqtha occurrence,
which sticks in the ooze stage. Oil was got
by Baragwanath when lie prodded the river
bed of mud with his stick, and he captured
enough to make a decent sample. The
trouble was that what it did sample was, in
his opinion, more like commercial oil than
the crude stuff from Dame Nature’s stocks.
Bux Lyne and Charlton Dods, slanging
Baragwanath, say that he doesn’t state facts,
and that he mixes up geologic terms. Per-
haps ; still he hasn’t been far out in his final
deductions about the Cabbage Garden’s
grease-spots hitherto. As, however, the South
Australian Oil Co. accepts Lyne and Dods
as the superior authority, the drill is to be
set at work —to break or make Baragwanath.
The immediate outlook for holders of
Malayan and Siamese dredging paper is
much less hopeful than it should be with tin
well over £220. The market for scrip, after
being forced up early in the year, slunk
back and has jibbed ever since. Supporters
became overloaded; and bullish operators
who had been ticktacking turned round and
beared the very things they had been recom-
mending. So game did they become that
they ignored a persistent advance in tin
which still continues; while the overloaded
public looks on with a sheepish helplessness.
It cannot sell, and it cannot buy; hence the
market stagnation. A bull market in tin
and a bear market in scrip is an original
Stock Exchange experiment which has finan-
cial ill-health written all over it.
The Speck’s West Coasters begin to real-
ise that they won’t have cheap treatment
from Gepp’s Electro Zinc Works at Zeehan.
Lead ores he rules out because to buy them
would be merely to accept the job of ship-
ping them to Port Pirie. No zinc sulphides
under a grade of 15 p.c. will be bought, nor
will ore be accepted which contains elements
and minerals that affect the E. Z. W orks.
Zeehan. of course, wants the works, but the
small parties packing through the jungle
will have to look elsewhere for a market;
and the German won’t be long before he
obliges them. Having customs works where
elements are welcomed, Eritz won t baulk
at any metallurgical jump. And when he
gets a' footing he will soon use his old pene-
tration tactics. #
Thursday Island has had another dis-
appointment. Neighboring Horn Island
kept a few families in spasmodic affluence
during the “good old days.” Twenty years
ago they sold out to a Melbourne syndicate,
which spent many thousands in a tip-top
40-head battery and plant. The smash was
sudden and heavy, and some of the macinnery
is there yet. Since then prospector after
prospector has delved in the hills, found
gold, dreamt of a fortune and come the in-
evitable cropper as soon as the battery did
the talking. The last of the list is a T.I.
bonifaae, who lias just chucked it up with
only experience to show on the credit side
of his ledger. Still, all Thursday Island
knows that the gold is there for the man
who is lucky enough to find it. In fact,
nearly every island in the Prince of Wales
group gave the fossicker a good show, in-
cluding Thursday Island itself.

The old Normanby copper-lode, near Mt.
Morgan, abandoned yeai’s ago, is being oper-
ated again by a syndicate, which proposes
to sipk a shaft on the lode. A few bunches
of ore assaying from 20 p.c. to 35 p.c. copper
are being struck, and on the whole the pros-
pects are fairly promising.

“Lex”: The Lubrano ease, which ended
in Sydney on Friday evening in a verdict
for the petitioner, was one of the few con-
tested divorce snits on record where the co-
re. —he is the Italian Consul in Sydney—
did not enter the box. This unexpected move

site assumption. A barrister "splits his
case” by proving only a portion of it
looking to the evidence of a witness on the
other side to enable him to re-open it. The
chief advantage Curtis anticipated from
leaving it to Vitali was the right to the
last word with the jury. As it turned out
he neither addressed the jui*y last nor ex-
tracted anything from Vitali. But he got
there just the same. The fact that a co-re.
declines to face cross-examination is no
evidence against him or the lady, as Justice
Owen was careful to stress to the jury. No
evidence, that is, in law. But juries are
rarely capable of rising to such heights of
fine discrimination. “There is the box,”
they argue • l ‘an<l here is a man chaiged
with adultery. If he is innocent, why not
say so on oath?” The same line of reason-
ing is often employed, with fatal effect,
against accused persons in criminal courts,
who. for their own good reasons, have
elected to give unsworn evidence from the
dock There was no direct evidence against
Vitaii and Mrs. Lubrano, but there was an
odd episode at Bowral—a registered letter
had been signed for in the name ot Lubrano
when Mrs. Lubrano was there. Mr. Curtis
suggested that the letter had been sent by
Vitaii, but for the reasons above mentioned
he did not get a chance to prove it. Lhe
costs will come to about £.>ooo, which was
the sum Lubrano claimed as damages. Ihe
jury gave him a farthing.

“Sixenate" : The innovation of giving a
prisoner parole for a special purpose nas
tried recently by the N.S.M. authorities.
The man was under arrest awaiting trial
when his wife died, and he was allowed to
attend the funeral on his own undertaking
to return. He duly returned, and was sub-
sequently sentenced to 12 months’ imprison-
ment. The parole system, though new here,
is an established institution in some parts ot
the world. In Sweden a prisoner sentenced
to a. term of imprisonment is allowed time
and freedom to fix up his family or business
affairs before the gaol doors close on him.
In Iceland a man who is even due to be
hanged may be let out to say good-bye to
his friends. But. then, Iceland is an island,
and not the sort of place where an absconder
from bail can make a dash into the bush
and sleep out.
“Ponipe” (Thursday Island) : 11.M.5.
Fantome is bidding good-bye to Torres
Strait. For the past five years she has
made her appearance with the s.-e. trades in
April and stayed till the approach of Christ-
mas sent her hurrying back to Sydney. Her
job has been the re-survey of the treacherous
waters round the strait; parts of the Admi-
ralty charts still actually bear the original
soundings of Duyphen (about 1623), and
there are entries made by Flinders and other
early birds. You can judge the extent of
the Fan tome's work by the one fact that in
1922 no less than 60,000 soundings made
by her were recorded for the Admiralty office.
And there is still seven years' work in sight.
There has been a Fantome in the Navy since
Nelson's time. But the days of the present
Fan tunic are numbered: and the old ship
with her clipper bows, tall masts and yaclit-
like appearance is to he replaced by a more
modern vessel, the Herald.

“T.0.T." : An ancient building known as
the Barn, a relie of the whaling days, has
been sentenced to demolition by the Mosman
(Sydney) Council. Archibald Mossman. aged
29,’ with his twin brother George, arrived
in Sydney from Liverpool in the brig Civilian
in. August, 1828, and the pair soon became
registered owners of two whaling vessels.
Nine years later Archie disposed of his in-
terest’ (George having previously dropped
out) to Hughes and Hosking for a life an-
nuity of £2900. which ceased, however, with
the failure of the buyers in 1842. The Barn
was completed in its present form 80 years
ago as a storage place for barrels of wliale-
oi) and shipping gear. Since the decease of
the whaling industry it has been put to
many uses. Church bazaars, dances, con-
certs, election meetings and Sunday-school
classes have been held there; between whiles
the place has served as a stable, a tallow-
candle factory and a tannery. Latterly it
has been nothing ranch except an eyesore.

nev Harbor. In the following year the
settlers, with their lubras and pics., occu-
pied the land, and having been supplied with
the necessary tools and a sartorial outfit
apiece, began to tickle the soil. They had
a chief of their own choosing in one Boon-
garie. who was a frequent visitor to the offi-
cial quarters in Sydney, where lie was known
as King Bungaree. He died in 1830 and
was buried at Garden Island. lhe soil at
George’s Heights was not equal to the _scant
requirements of Binglii: he. after giving it
what he called a fair trial, left it to the
white pfeller. who thereafter occupied it
mainly for military purposes. The area over
which a 21 years’ lease has now been given
to a golf club, is still to be available to the
Defence Department. ¥ #
“gammas” : During the summer months
water is as scarce as sovereigns in Perth,
and such supply as there is lias the
color of strong coffee and toe flavor or
mud. Desnerate measures are contrived
yearly to restrict the use of the stuff to
domestic purposes, among them being com-
plete prohibition of the use of lawn-sprink-
lers. But the limit was reached this month.
\ number of petty thieves had been haunt-
ing the suburbs stripping empty houses of
their portable valuables. To them the Water
Supply Department issued a polite request-
through the press, begging them to cut. oft
the water at the meters before stealing the
taps, as 05.000 gallons had been wasted m
one day through this unfortunate neglect.
“T.A.C.”: “Blanc's” yarn of the two
Welshmen who were mistaken for Huns (B.
15/11/’23) reminds me of a big Austral-
Swede. a member of the 3rd Battalion, who
found himself several times in custody on
suspicion of being a German spy. One
night at Wytschaete he was sent by his
platoon-commander with a message to an-
other outpost. The password for the even-
ing was “Woolloomooloo.” a word to which
no squarehead could do full justice. His
failure to supply it promptly when chal-
lenged would have sent him west if the sentry
liad been a crack shot. However, with a
bullet through the coat-sleeve his brain put
in some overtime, and as he dropped into
the nearest shell-hole he yelled “V.oolloomoo-
loo. I'm a vriend. of de T'ird Battalion.
Don’t shoot again.” Even then his word
was not taken for it until he was hauled
before the company-commander and identi-
fied.
“P.A.Q.” on a murderous isle: —
“F A.” (B. 11/10/’23) describes White Island
Bay of Plenty (M.L.), an uninviting spot. It
is worse than that. The island is really the P
of a volcanic mountain, ?.S miles from Opotiki. Jt
is circular and about
one mile in diameter.
Its sea frontages are
continually changing.
I have landed at a
beach which on my
next visit had wholly
disappeared. In 1885
an Auckland syndicate
commenced operations
for the production of
sulphuric acid, but
abandoned them in
eight months as too
risky. Later a syndi-
cate from British Col-
umbia acquired the
place, and in 1913 it
erected works and in-
stalled plant. The
first trouble occurred
through the presence of
a new acid, which cor-
. roded the retorts and
caused an explosion,
resulting' in the death
of a workman. In Sep-
tember, 1914, a party
of 10 men was landed
on the island f»r the
purpose of quarry rag
the sulphur, ar.J that
was the last ever wen
of any of them. Soon
after their arrival loud
explosions had been
heard at frequent inter-
vals, and on a party
going out from Opo-
tiki to investigate
was found that the
whole conformation of
one side of the island
had altered. Not only
the 10 men, but the
works, plant and dwell-
ings had all com-
pletely disappeared and
no trace of them has
ever been found. Now
comes news that a
British syndicate is proposing to work the sul-
phur. Its capital is £ 100,000. 1 would need
the lot before 1 would consent to spend one weeic
ashore there, although 1 don’t mind an occasional
day’s fishing in the adjacent waters, which teem
with kingfish and hapuku.

“Bunchytop”: Pidgin English can hit the
nail forcibly on the head sometimes. In
New (luinea the natives refer to the banks
as “house money-true,” but the Treasury is
“house money-ghmmon.”
“Howitzer”: Death came to a man in
all sorts of queer ways at the Front —and
behind the Front, too. Most of the u.c.o.
instructors at the improvised schools behind
the line were careful men, but there were
exceptions. My exhibit in the case had a
class of 10 whom he was training in the
use of a new rifle-grenade. He had passed
one around for inspection, and when it was
returned to him he began to expatiate on its
perfect safety. To demonstrate this quality
he dropped it from his outstretched baud.
THE TEST.
DORA : “I’d be willing to go to the end of
the world with him.”
FLORA : "So would lots of girls. But they
wouldn't go straight home from the wed-
ding to a Dorlinghurst flat.”
The resulting explosion killed the instructor
and four scholars, and sent four more into
hospital. During the tour someone investi-
gating the workings had drawn the safety-
pin and failed to replace it.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The prisoned ..ind in violins
Cries its old memories of trees ;
The gallery overflow's the stairs,
The empty boxes flaunt their ease....
And the music that throbs and the spotlights that
stream
Seem to play in my heart on the wreck of a dream ,
Yet you wished me “good luck,” said the dram;
was “fine,”
That you wanted a rest —-“just a book and a
smoke” —•
And something forgotten moved under your smile
Till a devil of doubt in its corner awoke.
As you fastened my cloak —for I “mustn’t get
cold”—
Your eyes mot my own eyes, now searching, now
bold.
I “looked pretty,” you said; but 1 felt all the while
You were grudging the moments. Your eyes did
not stray,
Yet I knew what the tick of the clock said to you,
As it beat out a rhythm, “The cat is away!”
The cat is auiay. From that too-quiet house
Are you stealthily treading to tryst with your
mouse ?
Oil! Shame 1 should think it! The acting is good;
That heroine’s shoulders are dimpled and fair.
With what a fond gesture your arm used to close
Round mine in those moments we snatched from
despair!
You couldn’t feel so for another, my dear.
I am wicked to doubt, but 1 wish you were here!
Now the first act is over, the curtain swings down,
The people arc clapping, the violins cry.
Ah, they sound like the voice of a woman who moans
For a devil of doubt that was spawn of a lie.
Do you trick me to-night at a game we. would play
In the wonderful days when our eat was away?

“Ex-Dig.”: “Top Rail” (B. 22/1/23)
suggests 29 shrapnel pellets and a smashed
foot as a record number of wounds for one
man. Sergeant Miller, of the Ist Battalion,
got a single shrapnel burst all' to himself,
and it gave him wounds in 37 different spots.
The first idea was that, if lie.ever recovered,
he would be permanently disabled, yet when I
got back to Sydney 1 found him, apparently
hale and hearty, conducting an estate
agency at Bondi. I believe he is now run-
ning a physical-culture school in South
Africa. And I doubt if Miller’s 37 was a
record. The Ist Battalion had a man who
had the right to wear 11 wound stripes, for
wounds separately received ; yet it was said
that his total actual line-service did not
exceed a couple of hours. He got “knocked”
with such monotonous regularity going into
the line, or immediately he got there, that
on the last occasion he was charged with
“self-inflicted wounds”; but nothing was
proved against him. Yet what between hos-
pitals and hospital leave his existence was
certainly a pampered one, and it gave trench-
worn Diggers a pain to see him swanking in
London with the full issue of gold which
made the uninformed regard him as a special
line in heroes.

“ Jeaines” on the Americanisation of clothes :
, An anonymous tailor has been fulminating hi
Sydney S'ux against the wretchedness of London’s
taste in men’s clothes compared with that of his own
city. His brother had a suit made in Sydney:
In the fashionable parts of London he was stopped
many times by men who took a pride in their appear-
ance, and asked who made the suit.
Which shows that there are as many legpullers at
the heart of Empire as anywhere else. It is absolutely
CONSIDERATE CHILD.
MOTHER: “Aren’t you going to say your prayers to-night, Mary?”
MARY (who has been very interested in a funeral next door): “No,
mother. I think Cod’s too busy unpacking Mrs. Jones"
impossible that a Loudon dude should have seriously
acclaimed a Sydney Bmmmel’s clothes, for r.he
painful reason that during- the past 10 years Sydney
has been increasingly importing- its male modes from
Chicago. The world’s acknowledged best dressers —
some of whom, like the King of Spain, are foreigners
—do not copy the fashions of America. They buy
every stitch they wear in the AVest End of London.
The reason can he seen in Sydney on any big race
day in the form of eoquettishly tight little jackets,
with purposeless belts at the back, absurdly pointed
shoes and diaphanous silk socks, tight sleeves that
finish well up the wrist in order to display a feminine-
looking double ctifif, and a hundred other horrible
examples of flash dressing—all straight from the
U.S.A. Before America invented a national style in
men’s clothes the prize usually went to France.
Paris was responsible for the allonge —the long,
narrow boot that turns up in front and has hardly
any heel, still sometimes seen on elderly Frenchmen
and Italians. But America now produces 10 sartorial
absurdities to Europe’s one, and it is a tragic fact
that the type of Australian youth who is the main-
stay of the ponies, the garbage press and the pictures
imitates all of them. As for some who should kno v
better, let this personal experience speak. In a
big Sydney emporium, I noticed a case of ready-
made clothes. One suit, to my amazement, was
marked 16 guineas. “That’s nothing!” smiled
the shop assistant. “Here’s one at 20 guineas.”
“Who buys them?” “Big professional and business
men,” he answered. “They like the Yankee style.
We import these from America, and they go off like
hot cakes.” The steady Yankeeflcation of our clothes,
language, newspapers, etc., is an indisputable fact:
it is when the calamity is represented as a boon
and a sign of superiority that a few words of protest
seem desirable.

“Ato”: Curious liow the fashion in Chris-
tian names changes! I have upon the rolls
of my school the names of about 300 boys.
There are 54 Williams. 10 Charleses, 10
Keiths, 10 Johns, 8 Roys, 0 Georges, 9
Berts, 8 Claudes, only 2 Richards, 2
Roberts, 1 solitary Thomas, and, strange
to say, not a single James. But I have an
Ethelbert, a Kitchener, a Lassalle and an
Asa. Nicknames haven't, changed much in
30 years, though one glimpses a few new-
comers, mostly of American and picture-
show origin—Dopey, for example. And there
is Bolshy.

“Astor” on an elusive malefactor:—
I have the opinion of an old- criminal Investigator
that Richard Buckley, ■ wanted for the Olenfen ie
(Vic.) hold-up, will take a lot of catching. Nothing
is more unlikely than that he is identical with the
man who is alleged to have approached a couple of
Manly chemists for a preparation for the removal of
tattoo marks. Buckley is not that kind of crook. He is
a low-lier of great patience, who knows that the best
disguise is to behave like a normally respectable
citizen. Whether or not he ' concerned in me
Glenferrie affair, he is certainly one of the pheno-
mena that criminologists love to study. The son of
a decent family in a Melbourne suburb, he became
mischievous •• at a very early age. His .first known
exploit was a trivial boyish misdemeanor. He was
an employee of the Government Printing office, and
one night, when his boss was giving a. party, he and
some other kids turned out the gas. For this he
was sacked,,.arid,.’drifting into low' company, started!
on his long-record with a minor burglary. He may-
have been embittered by the original injustice; be
was certainly not softened by a sentence of 12
months which was soon afterwards wrongly inflicted!
and for which he received no compensation. Since
then he has been known only as one of the most
ferocious and irreclaimable characters in Australian
criminal history.

Howitzer : \Y lieu our mob entrained
from Marseilles in ’l6 for Northern France
Ave liad a fair issue
of cin b lane. It
Avas rather an in-
sidious beverage,
and when an hour
or two later one of
our company was
reported missing
the general impres-
sion was that he
must have fallen
from the train and
been killed. Next
morning, at the
first stop after an
all-night run, we
were getting hot
water from the
engine, when a
bleary-eyed he a d
peered round from
the front of the
loco. Exactly how
he got there was
never ascertained,
but it was per-
fectly obvious that
the missing man
had slept the long
night trip on the
ledge above the
cow-catcher. His
only comment on
the feat Avas, “ ’S
a blooming good
job I don’t walk in
my sleep!”
“L>." : Emanuel Myerson, who succeeded in
his motion for a new trial before the N. S.
Wales Full Court on Friday, wears the V.C.
of Australian litigation. His previous actions
against Smith’s Weekly (of which he won
one and lost the other) have already earned
the Sydney Bar a small fortune, and now the
battleground between these two parties is to
be shifted to London and the Privy Council,
where Costs are reckoned daily not in hun-
dreds, but in thousands. A big Privy Coun-
cil “silk” may have from two to three thou-
sand guineas marked on his brief, and his
junior is paid two-thirds of what the senior
gets. Similar lavishness characterises every
department of the proceedings. Practitioners
in this august jurisdiction scorn to read
typed matter. The case has to be presented
to them in the form of a printed book.
Since the Myerson suits have been eminent
“FIRST CATCH YOUR HARE."
“Pluck, my boy, pluck! First and last, that's what spells success
in business."
“Oh, I quite understand that, pater. The trouble is to yet 'em,
to stand while you do it.”
t'or complication and length, the volume that
will shortly see the light in London should
be quite as long as a Dickens novel. The
parties will pay for these luxuries as they
go on, costs being “costs in the cause.” It
is when finality is reached, and one or other
is required to finance the whole series of
engagements, that the full horror of legal
warfare on such a scale will become appa-
rent. However, win or lose, Mr. Myerson
can be satisfied on one point. His name
will go down in forensic history as that of
a Murray or Jacka of the Courts, and law-
yers’ children yet unborn will call him
blessed.
“Ex-Dig.”: During the war “Aus-.
tralia House,” Kilburn, was a more
popular place than the big building-
in the Strand. It was the home of a
couple of very Australian Australians living
ii: London, and the centre of a circle of
people who were keen on making life pleas-
ant for members of the A.I.F. The place
was full of souvenirs sent over by grateful
Diggers. One of the neatest was a complete
coffee-service made out of shell-parts—the
cups fashioned from the uosecaps and the
spoons from driving-bands, while cases pro-
vided the bigger items. That lot should be
worth more now that if it were fashioned
of silver.
“H.M.”: There are cit ies where it is in-
judicious to boast about beating the un-
righteous, and Sydney is one of them. Held
up the other evening by three thugs who
demanded his valuables, a suburban resident
handed over a couple of notes and some silver,
and so impressed his assailants by his
assumption of scared submission that they
took his word that this was the lot without
running the rule over him. Reporting the inci-
dent at the police station, the victim men-
tioned. as testimony to his own shrewdness,
that the thieves had missed a fat wallet
and a valuable watch. Next night he was
set upon again and told with much blanky
that his assailants had called back to repair
their previous omission. And this time the
man who had opened his mouth too wide,
while not opening his pockets wide enough,
got a rough handling to impress on him the
value of discretion.
"Sturt”: South Aus., which has ahvays
had a bit of Scotch caution about it, seems
to be adopting—in effect- —the Not Proven
verdict. Its most sensational criminal case
(outside of murder
trials) of recent
years was aban-
doned after two
juries in turn had
failed to arrive at
any decision. And
now the “Crown"
has decided to drop
the rather comical
libel case in which
after a painfully
long hearing, a
jury couldn’t de-
cide whether the
Herald, Adelaide’s
Labor daily, and
Kneebone. its edi-
tor, ha d be e n
guilty of a criminal
act in saying can-
did thing.! about a
recent cadet camp
and those who
ran it.

murderously at the

these memorable
words: “Wisliter

in search of the girl.
THE LONG THOUGHTS OF YOUTH.
“Say, daddy, supposing Joan of Arc had mar-
ried Captain Cook, would it have made
much difference to the people in Aus-
tralia?”
AD MISERICORDIAM!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“When certain criminals are brought to book, and
are pronounced guilty, they can be trusted to ‘try
on’ the Bench with the snivel that they were ‘drunk
at the time.’ In their currish solicitude for their
own skin they raise the contemptible whine.” — Age.
See where they stagger down the street,
Revolting eye and ear and nose,
Robbing the bobby on his beat
Of that which he so loves —repose.
Their wits are out now liquor’s in:
They cannot stand such medicine.
Swift on their vinous heels the Law
Pursues, like some revengeful hound.
They’re hurried through a court’s dark maw
To hear a Stipe’s cold tones resound:
“Hard tack you’ve swallowed by the yard ;
Now swallow three months —also hard.”
Tears dim their eyes, sobs choke their speech,
As to condone their dire offence,
And the judicial heart to reach,
They sound their slogan—a defence
Oft heard by Justice in its shrine:
•‘The wine is down! Lift up the whine!’

After sticking manfully to his job through
a year of ill-health, Dr. Gallagher, the
broadminded R.C. Bishop of Goulburn
(N.S.W.), has gone to his reward. Born
in Ireland 77 years ago. he was ordained at
23 and came to Australia the next year as
a missioner priest. He had 14 years as
head of St. Patrick's College, where he estab-
lished a reputation for Greek scholarship;
in 1895 he became coadjutor-bishop of
Goulburn. and bishop in 1900.
__ Ogilvie, the Speck’s latest Attorney-
General, was 10 years ago serving his time
as an articled clerk under the present Jus-
tice Ewing. The other day it fell to him
in his Ministerial capacity to order the
Judge up from Launceston to the capital to
take the place of the* indisposed Chief Jus-
tice. Premier Lyons had a somewhat simi-
lar experience in 1915: as Minister for
Education he was able to issue instructions
to Director of Education McCoy, who a few
years previously had bossed him as a very
junior school-teacher.
Bishop Averill, of Auckland, finding a
vacancy in the Cathedral Chapter, has
chosen a Maori canon—the first appoint-
ment of a native to the Chapter. He signs
himself W. H. Ivereton.
A mighty Methodist was Dr. Henry Bur-
gess. just dead in Adelaide at 84. He came
to Australia as a child with his father, an
official of the Burra copper-mine, and was a
preacher at 20. He won all the honors open
to a Wesleyan in S.A., and was at one time
President of Conference for all Australia.
He had 12 years as sec. to the Children’s
Hospital - in Adelaide; but his best work was
done in inducing various local sects to join
in one united Methodist Church. Burgess,
who was a prolific writer, did all the S. A us.
part of the “Picturesque Atlas of Australia.”
A one-time Australian lady of rare' intel-
lect and charm has died in England —-
Madeline Dawes, daughter of Dr. Nathaniel
Dawes, Bishop of Rockhampton well over
20 years ago. She was an early associate
of the Women’s College at Sydney Uni.,
where she received her 15. A., with honors in
physiography, botany and geology. She
left Sydney to go to Oxford, and eventually
became a mistress at St. Margaret’s, Scar-
borough. When the town was bombed she
received a shock from which she never re-
covered. Her mother survives her.
J. H. Dyer, formerly member for Borung
(Vic.), passed out the other day. A daily-
paper biographer says “Johnny” was offered
a portfolio by Iceberg Irvine 21 years ago.
Surviving politicians of that day never heard
of such an offer; and, indeed, Dyer’s seat
was so insecure that he lost it three months
after the present C.J.’s Ministry was formed.
Johnny was a likeable fellow, who must
have been quite at home as a Dunmunckle
shire councillor; but he would have been
little use in a Cabinet.
The man who will wear the vacant shoes
of Tom Garrett, the first N.S.W. Public
Trustee and overdue for retirement, is W. J.
Kessell. Adelaide-born, he started his offi-
cial life at Bathurst (N.S.W.) as assistant
C.P.S.; then he was sent to the Depart-
ment of Justice in Sydney, and steadily
climbed to the chair of Assistant Under-Sec.
With the new job lie gets £l5OO a year,
which will rise to £1750.
“Gallery” : If the Vic. Cabinet is to fall
to pieces a bit at a time Arthur Robinson
may break away next. He is inclined to be
domineering and Tory, and the Radical-
Liberal element still in the team is chafing.
Robinson has got almost everything that an
TJppah Chambah member can have—the chief
law office, K.C.M.G., leadership of his
House, and the social position that goes with
an outward-curving bank account. By
slipping out like McPherson did he would
avoid the crash when the whole Cabinet
topples—a happening that is prevented only
by the absence of an alternative Liberal
leader. What a chance Eggleston has missed
in not understudying for the Premiership in
the last two years!
T. G. Ellery, former town clerk of Mel-
bourne, who died on Oct. 14, left a modest
£4706, all of which goes to his widow.
One of the candidates in the British elec-
tions is Bertram Arthur Levinson, who went
to Wesley College, Melbourne, towards the
end of last century and afterwards collected
the M.A., LL.B. at the Uni. For a while
he read with Justice Isaacs, and then estab-
lished a practice that grew with unusual
rapidity. But London called in 1912, and
he has since become a partner in the law
firm of Barnett and Gluckstein, incidentally
serving with the Royal Engineers in the
war. He is after the Acton seat in West
London as a private in the army of Asquith
and Lloyd George.
“T.R.PI.” : Lord Robert Cecil, who is to re-

‘‘Old Parliamentary Hand”: McPherson’s
resignation was not nearly so dramatic as
Jack Murray’s from the Bent Ministry
(1006). Murray threw up his job on the
floor of the Assembly because he thought the
Premier had taken the business of putting
through a land bill out of his hands. Murray
later got even by outing Bent and taking
his place. I. A. Isaacs (now of the High
Court) caused thrills by moving out of tne
Patterson Cabinet (1898) because certain
bank directors were not prosecuted and be-
cause lie was practically blocked from filing
presentments. Sargood, with one or two
Cppah Chambah colleagues, marched out
of the first Turner Administration It) weeks
after joining it; and as the Bent Cabinet
(1908) was tottering to its fall Peacock,
Mackinnon and Swinburne Went out with
flags flying and escaped the dust of the
general crash.
December 4 is the anniversary of the
birth, of airman Ross Smith, who is to have
a fine memorial at Adelaide.
Buried at Woronora Cemetery the other
day, Henry Kirke White, chemist, late of
Rylstone (N.S.W.), said to have been a
nephew of the poet. The relationship isn’t
impossible, even though it is 117 years since
the poet died.
“Schnorrer”: The Worker showed a pro-
found ignorance when it suggested that
Monash had got his name from the well-
known Yiddish word (B. 22/11/’23). There
is no such Yiddish word —-if such a word
exists at all, it is merely the corruption of
an English one. Although Monash himself
is Australian (he is the son of Louis
Monash, of St. James’s Park, Melbourne,
and was born there in 1865), his family is
probably connected with the Monasli
Brothers, who for a couple of centuries have
been the largest printers of Jewish books in
Europe. These Monashes were from Posen,
which was Polish till Frederick the Great
grabbed it, and is now again part of the
reconstructed republic.
“Nitric”: For sheer brilliancy let me
nominate Jessie Stevenson, a first-year stu-
dent at Q. ’Varsity. She has just obtained
five merits in her first-year Arts (Latin,
Greek, Logic and Psychology, Pure and
Applied Mathematics —all honor subjects),
and lias also to her credit the Byrnes
Memorial Medal for the best junior pass and
first place in the Senior Public exam. The
average age of a fresher is 19, but this young
person has still three years to go before she
reaches that figure.

tic direction

Melba grand,

“Tusi Lava”: By the. death of Charles
Roberts, Samoa has lost its best-known iden-
tity. He was a scholarly person and a
friend of Stevenson and Rupert Brooke, but
in the past 40 years he had been, among
other things, a horse-trainer, horse-owner,
bookmaker and hotelkeeper as well as
planter and Chief Judge of Samoa. Under
the German regime in Samoa, Roberts, then
practising as an advocate, demanded that a
client’s case be heard in English—and, sur-
prisingly, carried his point. He was known
as Charles Roberts throughout the Islands,
but there was a general impression that for
some reason of his own he had adopted that
name after leaving Oxfordshire.
A. F. Roberts, who is to go as M.L. Com-
missioner to the Empire Exhibition, is Dun-
edin-born, head of the firm of Murray, Roberts
and Co., and son of John Roberts, knight,
who amassed many bawbees in the Scawtch
city and has returned much of it by way of
benefactions. He is deep in Big Business in
Maoriland, and during the war had the job
of embarking the Diggers.
George Fairhurst Hutchinson, who went
west a few days ago in North Sydney, at 80,
was an old identity of Forbes (N.S.W.),
which he represented in the Assembly in the
stirring early ’nineties.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos Robert Blue (B.
15/11/’23). On January 24, 1817, Lachlan
Macquarie, Governor, granted William Blue,
bis heirs and assigns, to hold for ever, SO
acres of land, which included Blue s Point
and up to the head of Lavender Bay (Syd-
ney Harbor). Bine
died in May, 1834.
aged 97. In bis
will lie left the
grant to William,
Robert, Mary, Su-
sannah and John
Blue, and William,
the eldest son, was
appointed execu-
tor. Robert Blue
leased 50 acres of
the grant in July,
’3O, to ll.enry
C’roasdaile Wilson,
police - magistrate,
of Sydney, and in
1878 a very small
portion of the land
was sold to John
Carr for £30,000.
This was at the
head of Lavender
Bay, on which
Carr built the old
house known as
Hellespont. Susan-
nah B 1 u e mar-
ried one Lavender,
mate of a hulk
lying in the bay,
whose name was
given to the inlet.
W. ANGLISS,
M.L.C. (Vic.), the
frozen-meat king.
The widow of Capt. R. Hugh Knyvett—-
lie. died in America as the result of wounds
on the very day his book, “Over There with
the Australians,” saw the light-—has just
taken over the job of sec. to Sir Tom
Bridges, Governor of S. Australia. On her
husband’s death in 1918, Mrs. Knyvett
joined the staff of the British Embassy at
Washington ; the next year saw her in the
Foreign Office in London, and she left there
with the British delegation to the Washing-
ton Conference as sec. to the two Far East-
ern advisers. The energetic lady was born
at Orange (N.S.W.), and is the daughter
of the late Alwyn Maude.
“Coot” : “T.0.1.’5” par. re the father of
Maoriland’s ex-Justice Chapman (B.
15/11/’23) might have included that he was
the real author of the modern system of secret
ballot —the man who took the crude ideas
of other reformers and worked out a practical
scheme. His system was first brought into
operation at the Victorian election in 185b —
the first under the new Constitution. Chap-
man’s system was adopted by S. Aus. in
1857 and N.S.W. in 1858; and shortly after-
wards the other colonies followed suit. Eng-
land and the United States copied it later.
Henry Adams, who has just been re-
appointed to the State Savings Bank Board
in. Adelaide, has been on it since 1898. Her-
bert Pliillipps, the chairman, has 23 years’
service. But neither has yet come near to
the long-stayers of the past. Colton, Milne
and Todd were all on the Board for 30
years or so; Henry Ayers had 39 years, and
E. T. Smith topped the list with 45.
An old friend on his way to Australia is
the Rev. Carr-Smith, who was one of Syd-
ney's best-known parsons when he shep-
herded at St. James’s. He is High Church,
and some sacerdotal storms blew about a
few of his observances : but Sydney has known
no cleric more sincere. With a private for-
tune, he allowed himself no extravagance
but charity, and from his own purse con-
ducted a “breakfast” for down-and-outs.
When the Clerks’ Union was formed, and
the sweating of clerks exposed, he promptly
became a member, claiming admittance as a
“clerk in holy orders.” They made him a
life-member. One of Carr-Smith’s ideas was
to establish a liaison between religion and
the stage, and many an impecunious mum-
mer at any- rate got close enough to the
church to bite at the good vicar’s cheque-
book. He is now a canon, and shows his
affection for Australia by spending his first
long holiday here.
W. M. Ollivier. crossed out at Christ-
church (M.L.), was the most-looked-for em-
ployee in every railway camp in the South
Island —for 28 years he had been cashier and
paymaster in that section. Since retirement
from the service he had been secretary of
the Canterbury Chamber of Commerce. An
only son is Geoff., M.L. tennis champion.
From one of the family:—
“T. 0.1.,” in his reference to the late Justice
Chapnian of Maoriland (B. 15/11/’23), was in error
in suggesting- that the ex-Justice who has just been
appointed President of the M.L. Pensions Appeal
Board is his only surviving son. Martin Chapman,
K.C., of Maoriland, is another and two more live
in Melbourne.
THE LAST DIGGER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Some day, when the half of a hundred years
Have merged into yesterday,
The papers will dribble their inky tears
On one who’s unknown to-day.
Some day—and 1 know they will mean it well—
They’ll banquet the Very Last,
And tell, as only those days may tell,
Of deeds of the distant past.
But those wno have been to the edge of things,
'The Diggers who had to fight,
Will not be on deck when the future sings
The praise of this last brave wight.
They’ll be —well, what does it matter, my friends,
Where Diggers who fought will be?
Enough to be down where a poppy bend*
With weight of a memory.
(You pass them at work or about the street,
But how might you hope to know
That he sits down with his ghost to eat,
And he keeps a fear below?)
For they have looked into the things unseen,
And walked by the ways untrod,
Too close to the shadow of Might Have Been,
Too near to the eyes of God.
And that which they did on the “other side"
Is nought to the thing they do ■
When grins spread out to their ears and hide
The things that they feel from you.
Oh, wave at the flags when the Last steps out
And bows in the banquet place,
And fill up your lungs with a noise and shout:
“The Last of the Digger Race!’’
And don’t be dismayed if you chance to hear
This echo about the place:
“Say, Digger ghosts, give him a rousing cheer—
He fought at the Blanky Base.”
N.S.W.

ABORIGIALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
'Paul Cupid : An acquaintance whose in-
terests are centred in wool and broadacres has
brought under my notice a peculiar habit or pre-
caution of a captive dingo in his possession. The
warrigal was full-grown when caught—he had been
vun into a hollow log by one of the station-hands--
and in answer to my question as to why lie kept
the pest Broadaeres replied, “Oh, just to observe
his habits!’’ He feeds the warrigal on rabbits, and
always before he dines that dingo sets to work
and disembowels his dinner and places the offal
on one side. On no occasion, Broadaeres assured me,
has Warrigal eaten any of the innards of the rabbit,
lame dogs are not so finicky in food matters, and
it set me thinking that the reason of Warrigal’s
delicacy might be that he once became indis-
posed through eating the inside of a poisoned rabbit
in far-off, inexperienced days. Has any dingologist
ever observed anything similar?
“Archbell” : - Reverting to the question of
how cuckoos put their eggs in other birds’ nurseries,
a while back another chap and I found a cuckoo
chick in a tomtit’s pest. Now, if the old bird
didn t use a funnel to get the egg in there, I
reckon she must have laid it on the ground and
transported it through the very small door in the
■ its nest with her bill. We are watching the
chick grow, and reckon his foster-mother will have
to use a tin-opener to get him out.
“Spinifex": “Ringtail’s” lady 'roo (B.
8/11/’23) who permitted the quandong stones and
the egg to remain in her pouch just didn’t bother
about them. Most bushmen know that a female ‘roo,
hard-pressed or wounded, will “throw” her joey when
passing over suitable cover. She usually camouflages
the act with a stagger that is almost a fall. If
"lien you get her the pouch is enlarged and sweaty,
but empty, go quietly back to the spot where the
lady stumbled and utter a short, guttural sound, sug-
gestive of a gentleman with a fly in ins throat—and
it’s 10 to 1 the little chap will sit up close by. The
motliei must throw him, because she obviously
selects the spot, and young Joseph can’t possibly
know just when and where he is to get off.
“Bundy”: Old Jimmy Rafe—his surname
was really Ralph, although it was pronounced Rafe
—was a great horseman, as “Billy Brolga” says (B.
I 11/’23) ; but my most vivid recollection of him was
when at the age of 70 he asked me to shout a big
rum, and as a special inducement said he would
diink it standing on his head. I produced the rum,
and foi thvvith James stood on his head in the corner
of the bar and got it down upways.
M.(i. : After watching Binghi swallow
about a gallon of beer at Kurrawang, I remarked,
“That much beer will kill you, Jack.'’ “No fear,”
Jacky replied promptly; “I drinkit six bottles one
day, and it take no notice of me.”
“Hornswoggle” : Does any Abo. know the
real origin of the name Bury-Your-Own, given locally
to Pulbah Island, Lake Macquarie (N.S.W.) ? Local
fishermen and old salts around the lake have some
weird legends to explain this strange name, but the
favorite tale is one current about Dora Creek and
Wangi. In the old days an escaped convict and his
mistress ran a selection
at Wangi Point, but at
the time of the gold
rush tlie master of the
house cleared out to
make his fortune at the
diggings. Eventually,
finding' Wangi more
profitable and less dan-
gerous than Ballarat,
he returned, and found
that a Chinaman had
usurped his place. Re-
senting the reshuffle, he
knifed the offending
gentleman, placed the
dead body in his rough
boat, and forcing the
woman to accompany
him rowed across the
lake to the island. Here
he cast his grim cargo
of life and death
ashore, and rowed
away, ironically charg-
ing tlie living to “Bury
your own!” They say
that she burned the
body by night, and at
sunrise cast herself
from a cliff into the
water. The bluffiest
fishermen complain
that her ghost returns
to the island at full
moon, and fish can
never be caught near
it. Is there any backing- of truth to the legend?
“Jack-Shay”: I’ve been watching Nature
balance the books. First a wasp buzzed round ex-
ploring- a chink in the stone wall. Satisfied she
started to work. The stem of the papier-mache struc-
ture was soon completed, and on it the champagne-
glass bowl was planted. Then the bowl was divided
u ' t( L ® e ? ls - Spider after spider' was brought and
s tutted into a cell. Presumably when sufficient spider
had been stored the eggs were laid—anyhow, the cells
were finally all sealed up and the wasp faded out.
With the first hint of winter’s departure a spider
came prospecting around the wasp-comb. Satisfied
she started, stretched braces and guys and bridles
to and tro across the- space in front of the wa?p-
incubator, and finished up with a web that completely
masked the comb. In early Spring the game was
afoot. I observed the spider dealing with an en-
meshed young wasp. Later the skeletons of y oU ng
wasps simply crowded the web. Then one day I
noticed that by some means the bowl of the wasp-
NOT QUITE SO WELL PUT AS IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

JUVENIS: “About But not so thick.”
nest had been cleared of partitioning combs, was nicely
lined with web and served the spider as a den.
Several wasps made savage attempts to get at her,
but her “possy” beat them.
From a very angry liusbandman:—
Looked at from a commonsense point of view
the protection of animal pests is a stupid policy.
Looked at from the angle of the man who gets a
crust from his labor on the land, whether he be Mr.
Bellywool, Mr. Butterfat or ,Mr. Clodhopper, the
policy is blastiferous. “Our native birds and ani-
mais must, be protected from destruction,” say the
highbrows who lose nothing by the noetuvnal and
diurnal devastations of the pests, and who view
the matter from a spectacular point, without con-
cerning themselves about* the huge losses in both
pastures and crops. No sane person would
deny the wisdom of protecting most stringently ail
our purely insectivorous birds, but the protection
nLn pan n 0S ; - IKI cockatoos that swoop down
upon all grain crops by day, and the kan-
garoos, wallabies, ’possums, bandicoots, kangaroo-rats
and the thousand and one other pests that devour
crops ot gram or grass, or root out the cockalorum's
spuds by night, has no sound logic to support it—
nothing but the narrow and wealth-losing idea that
trie beautiful birds and the bounding’, hopping, crawl-
mg or climbing pests are fair to look upon, and if
not protected must soon become extinct. Win
not set apart a sufficient area suitable for
the creatures, securely enclose it to prevent
their escape, and remove the protection from
those outside? Ihe producer of grain, fruit or
grass and the gunmen and trappers who pursue the
pests for their skins could soon settle & outside
iot. [hose who talk of these animals 'becoming
extinct forget that m the ordinary course of event?
they must become extinct some time, as population
increases. Anyhow, what does it matter if they do
become extinct? Aren’t the diprotodon and other
huge and hairy monstrosities extinct? And don’t we
rub along very well without them ?
* * * *
“Jimmy Possum”: Without iu any way
wishing to discount the fact or the theory about Mrs.
Marsupial sitting with her tail bent forward between
her legs, and the young being born 0 n the soft hairs
of this appendage, as described by Zoologist *V S
Le Souef (B. 25/10/’23), I’d like to ask on whose
tail Mammy Native-bear sits to have her baby. I
ain’t sayin’ I don’t believe it; I’ m only askin’.
“Zanthus” : Acid to the list of Australian
birds of which the e are no specimens known in
Australia the Eyrean grass-wren {Amytornis aoy-
den). There are only two examples known to exist
and they are both in the British Museum. They were
collected by F. W. Andrews, a member of the Lake
Eyre exploring expedition; and sent to Gould in
18/5. The e may be some of these little birds away
up in the interior, but no one seems to have seen
any since that date.
Keystring : I nominate the pumpkin as
the general-utility vegetable. It was while I was
staying with a family in Bananaland, and the flour
supply gave out through boggy roads, that I saw
it at its variegated best. As a vegetable in its
own right we had it both baked and boiled; the
lady of the house made about six different-flavored
the principal ingredient of each being pumpkin ;
'■t also got scones made from the same vegetable
with the addition of a little finely-ground maize;
and it was quite common to .see the kiddies going
about with cold slices of cooked pumpkin, well
smeared with butter and making an excellent substi-
tute for bread. It makes splendid fodder for cattle
and horses, especially the latter, and your Christ-
mas ham is more tasty if its original owner had
pumpkin on Ins menu. Further, a pumpkin poultic e
will draw that boil off the back of your neck as
neatly as ,an ALL.A. draws his salary. N.B.—Keep
a rag between the poultice and the skin.
“Meriin" ; A dingo-poisoner on Lucknow
(Q. ) found a litter of six pups, and promptly killed
five of them. The remaining one he greased all over
with fat charged with strychnine. The following
d iy he called again and collected the mother’s scalp'.
As anticipated, she had returned, and immediately
cleaned the youngster by licking all the fat off.
STIFF LUCK.
NOSEY THE NARK: “Somebody told me your
brother left, a lot of money when he
died ?”
PORKY THE PIMP: “ Yes —a policeman shot
him as he was gettin ’ away from the
bank.”
“Geo. Rich": While the ’roo pelt-snatchers
are hunting fresh tallies, permit me to heave the
heaviest hide on to the Council’s scale. Ripped
off the d 4ddy boomer of Southern Westralia, it went
141 b. green, and 71b. dry. Pegged out, it looked
like a young bullock’s blanket. Andrew Muir, a
South Groperland pioneer, shot and undressed the
midget.

“Tantalus” : The Council has recorded one
or two very fair records put up by Australians, but
in justice of the Cold Country let me quote the
London Observer of September 1, 1823: —
On Tuesday evening the biped rival of the dog
Billy undertook his match at the cockpit, Bainbridge-
street, St. Giles’s, to kill on his knees, unaided by
any weapon, 100 rats in 12 minutes. Soon after
7 o’clock this elegant resort of the fancy was crowded
to excess by an impatient assemblage of Corinthians
and Commoners, and into an enclosure of Seven
feet square, resembling a cornbin, the 100 victims,
well grown and provided at the sum of 6d. each for
this noble purpose, were turned out from traps and
cages. The biped candidate for fame, to many well
known as Mr. William Crofter, superintendent of the
granary of the Angel Inn, St. Clement’s, undauntedly
followed. Though blind of an eye, he instantly dis-
cerned his game, and a scene of biting, squeezing.
IN PERFECT AGREEMENT.
“Really, if you cannot do btter than this I shall have to yet another maid.”
“And two wouldn’t be a bit too many in this house, either, mum.”
and twisting ensued, unparalleled in the disgusting
annals of slaughter. The shouts and cheers of
triumph and encouragement during the performance
beggar all description. In less than six minutes
and a half all but one solitary rat was destroyed,
and this the hero of the cornbin finished by biting
off his head. He then retired with scarce a scratch,
amiu the acclamations of his friends.
“Rypo” : The Coleraine and Balmoral dis-
tricts of Western Vic get an occasional grin from
the newly-settled ex-Anglo-Indian officers thereabouts.
Wanting to saw some wood, one bought a saw, and,
finding it would not cut satisfactorily, concluded it
wanted sharpening, so he proceeded to sharpen it
where he had seen a man sharpen an axe —on the
grindstone. Another saw a hen scratching for a
family of 14 chickens; reckoning t hat the job was
too much for one mother, he killed all but three or
four of the youngsters. In one respect, however, the ex-
officers are up to date. They use a motor vehicle for
carting their wool—two bales to a load.
HE COULD MAKE USE OF
THAT FIVE BOB THEN.
MAGISTRATE: “Five shillings or the rising of the Court."
ACCUSED: “Will y’r Worship tell us if the Court will rise before the pubs shut?"
“Barcoo” on Lizzie’s new role: —
Rananalanders near Cooper’s Creek (S.-W.Q.) put
their motor-cars to uses other than joy-riding. Just
at present (shearing-time) the station tin-Lizzie on
this place, each alternate shearing-day, hauls all the
freshly-filled bales on to the top of the waiting car-
riers’ waggons. The method is simplicity itself. A
long, thin towline of wire is attached to the car,
about 60ft. in front of the waggon, and carried over
the top of the vehicle to the foot of two 4in-,
artesian-bore pipes, 16ft. long, leaning against the
stern. On the end of the wire is a sl'ip-loop, which
is popped round each bale. The loaders give the
word, the car-driver pulls into gear, and the bale
slips aboard. The operation is much swifter than
with the old method of having a horse on the end
of the tow. Another advantage is that, when the
load is up on to the second tier, and the gradient is
very steep, the ascending bale sometimes slips off
the chute when near the summit, in which case the
car will hold even a 4cwt. bale, till the attendants
push it back into position; whereas the horse of
necessity would “give,” and the load fall back to
the ground. Wheel chains are advisable, as the
ground after awhile loosens on top. Also, it is as
well to warn amateur car-men trying this method of
loading to .attach the tow to either car spring, and
not to the axle.
“B. Wire”: I once saw a waggon loaded
with 50 bales of Angledool wool capsize on the
road to Collarenebri. The off-wheels sank into
a soft patch and over she went. Another teamster
came along, and, after working a belly-rope round
the capsized load, hooked his team to it and pulled
the waggon and load upright again. The off-wheels
were corduroyed with logs as soon as they were clear
of the ground, and inside an hour the waggon con-
tinued its journey with the load very little out of
plumb.
“Mag”: After a short lesson in aerial evo-
lutions, five young swallows settled on my clothes-
line the other day and plaintively announced an
internal vacuum. The waiter and waitress hurried
aloft for the needful. Curious as to how the feed-
ing would be done, I squatted on the back steps and
followed proceedings. Fifteen minutes sufficed to
prove that there was no fixed system. ,As with young
children, so it is with swallows —the most vigorous
and persistent whiner hits the good nature of the
parent first and the menu hardest. No. 4 on the
line was an artist in this respect. From a head
that was the embodiment of perpetual motion, his
little eyes would catch the ’planing commissariat a
shade quicker than the others, and instantly that
little bundle of ruffled feathers would become a
hilarious capitalist and grab what was offering.
Fifty visits of the waiters produced for him 22 moths
and a distended equator. Certainly a very unfair
balance was left for the others. Incidentally, what
surprised me much was that, while the cabbage-garden
almost immediately below the line was teeming with
moths of all sorts, the tucker was invariably pro-
cured from the upper regions.
* * * *
“Zanthus” : What is the record Australian
crop of maize? In 1919, R. Dyball, jun., grew 199
bushels to the acre at Taree, on thp Marining River
(N.S.W.). If that isn’t the biggest crop it must be
pretty close to it. Orbost, on the Snowy River
(Vic.), is proud of its maize,j but it generally stops
at about 160 bushels to the acre.
* * * *
“A.W.L.”: What piscatorial acrobats can
beat the kingfish as high jumpers? I reckon they
can lift themselves from 40ft. to 50ft. above the
water; others may have seen them go much
higher—on a whisky-fishing expedition. Their speed
through the air puts one in mind of Fritz’s
“minnies.” I was once on a lugger that was idly
swinging, with sails flapping in an almost flat calm,
when, bang! and a large kingfish had jumped over
her and gone clean through her foresail. The canvas
in tile sail was probably pretty rotten; still what
•sort of a smack would a fellow receive if a kingfish
hit him?
“Ento” : A clothes-moth, resplendent in a
color scheme of white, brown and metallic yellow,
lives with the nestlir-gs of birds. I know 7 this
because SO of them were reared from the nest of
a white-eye collected from my garden (Brisbane),
immediately after the young had flown. Like
the more sombre household variety, which really
belongs to ah allied genus, the caterpillar of this
moth forms a covering from the material on which
it feeds (including the feathery down of its bed-
mates). Presumably the parent, “bearding the lion
in his den,” accomplishes the laying of her eggs
at night, and the young caterpillar soon becomes
wrapped in a downy blanket, and thus the birds
remain in ignorance of the delicacies they are har-
boring.
“Cobba Cobba”: For keeping their exces-
sive heat the coals of the sargooma, or bastard ebony
wood, will take some beating. Growing plentifully
on Woodlark Island (Papua), this tree is greatly in
demand as firewood, both by white miners and
natives. I have known miners, when leaving their
outside camps, carefully cover the live coals with
sand, and, on returning in six or eight days, they
have had no trouble in kindling a fire therefrom.
“Boori”: To satisfy the missus our young
Bill borrowed the grocer’s steps to remove the
family of -young starlings living above the ceiling.
When the nest was passed down, each of the four
birdlets had the tail-er.d of a small lizard pro-
truding from a face that beamed with satisfaction.
Is this a usual thing, or have Pa and Ma starling
been spying on Mrs. Kookaburra? Or was it
scarcity of grasshoppers? Still, maybe, they had
an appointment for the day and hit on the idea
of a continuous meal to tide the kids over tien
absence. The reptiles were 4 or 5 inches long
and of the kind that run about fences and among
stones.
* « * *
“Steve Hart”: Has anyone ever seen a
waterspout inland? A while back near Bingaia
(N.S.W.) a fierce Westerly blowing along the
Gwydir River (very narrow and shallow at the
spot) suddenly lifted a roaring, whirling column
of water 40ft. high. It appeared to be about 2ft. in
diameter, and moved eastward slowly for uOydS.;
then it struck an old dead gum, and after tearing
all the top limbs from it, collapsed, leaving sorpe
very dazed frogs, one small catfish and several
broken mussels around the tree.
“FY7”: Let me back my fancy in this
matter of effective dingo baits. Make a stiff dough
of tallow and flour, and roll it in blobs the size
of a golf-ball. Insert the poison deep in the ball
with the point of a knife, and close up;
wrap each ball in newspaper and fill your saddle-
pouch. Whenever a bait is to be laid, drop the
ball, first igniting the paper wrapping, the burning
of which adds to the fragrance of the bait, while
destroying all human taint. Care must be taken
if there is dry grass about, but the system is a
deadly one as far as the dogs are concerned.
Leonard Matters discovers a drink: —
The other dav I saw in the window of a second-
hand shop in Sydney a silver tube, about nine inches
long, having a perforated bulb at one end. I bought
it for a half-crown —its value as silver. The gentle-
man behind the counter had no idea what the thing
was, and when I told him it was a bombilla, he was
just as wise as he had been.
A bombilla is the tube through which the South
Americans take their tea. But their tea does not
come from Asia; it is a herb, native to Paraguay,
called yerba mate <nronounced “sherba mattee”). m
appearance it resembles chaffed clover, with a liberal
mixture of stick and stalk, and a substratum
of dust; but, appearances notwithstanding, yerba
mate is one of the finest beverages known to man.
It keeps whole .nations fit and well, and if ever it
is introduced to' Australia (and there is no reason
v\ by the plant, which belongs to the holly family,
shouldn’t be grown in Queensland and Westralia), we
shall be the better for it. Paraguayan tea contains
the same active stimulating agent (thein) as the
tea we drink, but lias no tannin. In it there are
certain digestive and laxative properties absent from
Asiatic tea; consequently it is an ideal drink for
meat-eaters, especially for those who do not get
a regular supplv of vegetables. South American
station-hands, herders, farm-laborers and farmers
eat the same hard tack as their fellows in Australia.
Their damper is of the consistency of a brick, and
tne method of breaking off a piece big enough to
chew is to prize the galleta open with a knife, or hit
it with a stone. Yet they are a remarkably healthy
and hardy lot —thanks largely to mate. They arc
not martyrs to indigestion and kindred ailments,
due to absorbing quantities of Asiatic tea with meat.
Paraguayan tea can be brewed in the same way as
we prepare our dyspeptic drink, but the method in
general use is to half-fill the little dried/gourd bowl
with the herb, put the bulb end of the bombilla in,
and then fill the bowl with water just on the boil,
sucking the liquid through the silver tube. Ordinarily
WELL AND TRULY EARNED.
ABE: "Oh, Issy, vot a peautiful voman!”
ISSY : “Yeth; they say she married him for
hith money.”
ABE : “Veil, she earned it.”
a mate bowl will hold about a third of a piiit of
liquid, which is green and bitter. That is a male
amcbrgo. A mate dulce is one with sugar added.
When the bowl is sucked dry more water is poured
in. To take a bitter mate first thing in the morning
is highly recommended by the faculty, but for the
foreigner the taste must be acquired, and acquiring
it is generally painful until the nice art of regulating
the intake of bitter, boiling liquid by checking the
inflow with the tongue is learned. Once a foreigner
likes mate he drinks it with the best of them.
Taking mate is a well-developed social custom
in the Argentine. If you go visiting in the country
vou are not regaled with tea, but with hot and bitter
yerba ; and if you are known to be addicted to it
you must not refuse to take the bombilla between
your lips and imbibe. Refusal in such circumstances
is a breach of etiquette. The promiscuous manner
in which the mate bowl is passed from one to an-
other is the only objection to the Argentine custom.
It is hospitality without hygiene. But if we take
to mate-drinking in Australia we need not import
the custom. Bowls are cheap.

By lazy Loma Loma, by Loma Loma town,
Drowsy in the noon,
Yellowing lie the shining sands, the reef shows bare

Small babbling waves and gabbling waves—and by

Straggling Loma Loma,
Sun-splashed Loma Loma with the brown girls on che

Through lazy Loma Loma a long road dappled goes.
Beside it, out of gear,
The creaking boats, the leaking boats are drawn,
the green grass shows
In many a slender spear
Upthrust between the timbers old; and half the

The tumbling naked babies brown around about them

While motley mongrels frolic and ginger chickens

Through crazy Loma Loma,

INTERVIEW WITH THE FURNACE and
gjgßfl
f
Mr. O. 8. NEILL.
A FEW months ago Mr. O. S. Neill and F. C. Fox joined in partner-
ship, which has resulted in a co. with a capital of £250,000, to
place on the Australian markets engineering machinery of the
highest productive capacity. Of their many agencies the first line selected
by Messrs. Neill and Fox to bring their co. into recognition is the Wilton
Patent Furnace, one of which is working to-day at the Metropolitan
Colliery, and as a result of the wonderful money-saving efficiency of
this furnace the Metropolitan Colliery Co. has placed a further order
for 32 more furnaces. Messrs. Neill and Fox claim that by using these
furnaces a saving of £3O per day results, being £9OOO for the year, and
paying the cost of the furnaces in the first three months.
Mr. R. A. Harle, managing director of the Metropolitan Co.,
instructed Messrs. Neill and Fox to test the furnace under the supervision
of the colliery engineers. The test was so satisfactory that the further
order of 32 furnaces was placed.
Following shows the result of the test:-

Dear Sir, — ;
We beg to inform you that we have now completed the Combustion and lhermal
Efficiency Tests on the Fern borough Lancashire Boiler, which we have equipped witn
one of our patent duff burning furnaces, the results of which we think you will agree
are highly satisfactory.

Further, the Mine Engineer, together with his fireman, believes that there is less
ash and clinker to be withdrawn from the fires—in fact, they are running a test them-
selves to see if they can run through the day without cleaning off at all. ihe total
amount of ash that percolated through the fire-bars during the whole of our visit would
not exceed 21b., and no combustible whatever was found in this ash.
We should like to say that we regret that two furnaces were not fitted to this boiler,
as we are convinced we could have shown considerably better figures than those we have
already shown. We enclose detailed schedule of the Thermal Efficiency Test and
Combustion Test, a copy of which has been forwarded to the Mine Manager at Metropoli-
tan Colliery.
We shall be pleased to wait on you in due course.
Yours faithfully,
THE FURNACE & POWER PLANT CONSTRUCTION CO., LTD.
Joint Managing Director.
THE WILTON FURNACE
is the finest thing of its kind in the world, and all colliery
managers and directors and manufacturing houses should make inquiry.
They can be used in any type boiler for steam raising. It is the only
forced-draught furnace with guaranteed equal draught throughout length
of grate. It can be erected in a few hours and leaves maximum combus-
tion chamber area, resulting in following advantages:—
Increases heating surface, thereby increasing steaming capacity. Allows
more perfect combustion. Saves crown of Boiler Tube from injury.
Permits fireman to clean fire more easily. Burns Coke, Coke Breeze,
Slack Coal, Slurry, Town s and Trade Refuse, Anthracite Rubbish, etc.
Air-pressure is equalised throughout entire length of grate, resulting
in:—
More intelligent firing for economy. Worst possible fuel can therefore
be burnt economically. Absence of tendency for dust, etc., to be blown
over bridge. Greatest possible efficiency, 16-18 per cent. CO 2.
T ire-bars are practically everlasting and can be replaced where
necessary without dismantling Furnace.
The Wilton Furnace can be used in any type boilers such as
Annealing and Puddling Furnaces, Brewers’ Coppers, Riverters Forges,
Tar Stills, Smelting Furnaces, Dust Destructors, Oil Stills, Distillation
Plant where open fires are used, Tyring Furnaces, Evaporators, Boiling
Vats, Brick Kilns, Roasting Kilns, Superheaters.
OTHER IMPORTANT AGENCIES.
The main object of the Company, broadly stated, is to develop
important engineering interests held by the Engineers, Mr. O. S. Neill
and Mr. F. C. Fox, both of whom have had exceptional scientific and
practical training and experience, and who together have evolved a
campaign of engineering business based upon a close study of existing
conditions. ;
Mr. F. C. Fox, who is a native of England, was trained in the English
Technical Schools, took a graduate course in Owen College, Manchester,
and was a medallist of the Mechanical Engineering College in London.
After extensive practical experience, he came to Australia to take up the
appointment of Chief Draftsman and Chief Engineer for the Clyde
Engineering Co., of Granville, which position he occupied for ten years.
During that time he was the Engineering Representative on the Managing
Board of the Company. Besides possessing the very highest scientific and
technical training, Mr. Fox has had the advantage of unusual shop
experience; he holds all the certificates available to a first-class engineer.
Mr. O. S. Neill acquired his engineering education at the Technical
College, Whitworth Street, Manchester, and entered Owen s College,
Manchester, to study Chemical Engineeering. He also received a training
in Industrial Engineering with the Weaver Refining Co., Acton Bridge,
Cheshire, and was, later on, Works Manager of the Branch British Glues
and Chemicals, Imperial House, Kingsway, London, a very large company
operating on a capital of two million pounds. At the outbreak of the
war Mr. Neill’s services were eagerly accepted by the Imperial
authorities, and he was engaged in the Royal Navy Air Branch, designing
aeroplanes and airships. Incidentally, it might be remarked that perhaps
with only one other exception, he holds unique distinction of possessing
certificates for balloon, aeroplane and airship flying in the Empire.
The differing qualifications of the engineers eminently fit them for the
object which they have set before themselves, which, as will be seen by
what follows, is the introduction of the very latest Mechanical Machinery

Coal Duff and other Waste.
POWER PLANT CONSTRUCTION CO. LTD
to be used in connection with the larger industries of the Commonwealth,
the elimination of waste, conservation of power, and the utilisation profit-
ably of vast quantities of low-grade raw material which now usually find
their way to the dumps.
COMBUSTION DEVICES.
A leading feature of the business .which will be handled by the
Company will be machines for the utilisation of waste fuels, oil, gas or
original carbon. The agencies held by the Co. cover a very wide field
in Chemical, Civil, Structural, Hydro-electric and Textile Machinery.
Patent devices in chemical machinery, as applied to the manufacture ol
soap, the extraction of crude oils, glycerine, acids, etc., regulus metal
plants for the production of acids and the handling thereof, filter presses,
tar-treatment machinery, are among the number.
Agencies of firms manufacturing the latest style of textile machinery
will be handled by the Company, one large agency, the rights of which
are solely held by the Company, being that which has recently been
engaged in the development of the Textile Industry in India. Connected
with this, they propose to use the Clayton Qoodfellows Modern Powei
Planfs operating all the modern 1 extile Machinery Installations.
MINING MACHINERY.
The Company represent the Thomas Shore Company, specialising
in all the latest Mine-pumping Machinery. The 1 homas Shore Pump 3
have been installed in all the leading mines in Great Britain.
A prominent English firm manufacturing Coal Washers has entrusted
the engineers with the introduction of their Machinery to Australia—the
Grange Iron Company, Durham. The object of this new machinery is to
improve the coke output, and it has been installed with highly-successful
results in the Sheffield collieries. U allows coal to be coked which could
not possibly be handled without washing. A very advantageous arrange-
ment has been made by which the manufacturers are prepared to supply-
designs and allow all the plant to be made in Australia. Incidentally, it
has been arranged to offer the most successful coke-oven plant in the
world, which will produce coke of commercial value from coals considered
to be valueless. This plant will treat bituminous slack coal, which, after
disintegration and washing, will bring out the highest-grade metallurgical
coke with the advantage that the gas generated may be utilised for power
purposes and for illumination, the production of tar, benzol and other oils.
This, it need not be said, is a highly valuable proposition, as it would
result in many deposits of what is now considered as valueless being
turned into gold-mines.
STRUCTURAL MACHINERY.
The Company has acquired one of the most influential interests in
Europe for the designing and manufacture of mild steel structures of any
type or weight, such as bridges, viaducts and so on. A Belgian house,
manufacturing structural steel of all shapes and weights, is included in
the proposed Company’s agencies. This firm is prepared to tender for
locomotives, steam and kerosene (a novelty in Australia), rolling stock
for main-line railways, signalling devices and light railway lines as feeders
for main trunk line, and complete electrification of suburban railways.
' The sole agencies in Australia and New Zealand have been acquired
for Yarwoods, who specialise in steam tugs and river craft, being makers
to the British Government. Quite recently a contract has been let for
this firm in New Zealand.
POWER PLANTS.
The Engineers have selected agencies and applied their attention
very closely to all classes of Steam Power Plant, both reciprocating and
turbine, always keeping in view the need for efficiency and economy in
fuel consumption. Their machines in this line carry with them a guarantee
of the production of the highest power by the use of inferior grade fuels.
They are also in a position to quote for electrical transformers and the
transmission of steam power into electrical power for use in the machine
shops and factories.

Mr. F. C. FOX.
Hydro-electric power plants, a coming thing in Australia, have also
attracted the attention of the Engineers, who will be prepared to quote
for any proposition, whatever its magnitude, in Australia.
Thanks to their extensive practical, varied train-
ing, the Engineers are prepared not merely to quote
for plant, but to undertake the actual installation and
operating of any machinery ordered from them.
Their resources are sufficient to enable them to face
any proposition in engineering machinery that the
Commonwealth is likely to offer.
The Furnace and Power Plant Construction Co., Ltd., is the first
and only Company of its kind
IN AUSTRALIA.
It will be the first Engineering Company in
THE COMMONWEALTH
to utilise and make productive vast quantities of low-grade raw material
which finds its way to the dump heaps. As an example: It will bring
into being and make productive and valuable Brown Coal.
All inquiries should be sent to the FURNACE AND POWER

Lord Beaverbrook writes to friends in
Australia that lie will be here early next
year: he will take in Japan on the tour.
Beaverbrook is almost as remarkable a man
as our late visitor Northcliffe. The son of
a Presbyterian parson in Canada, he was
a millionaire at 30 or thereabouts —arid not
by one lucky punch, but by a procession of
enterprises in which his imagination and
astounding energy had play. Then he crossed
to England, and, thirsting for power, decided
that as good a way as any to get it was to
become a newspaper proprietor. So he
bought the Daily Express, and a few weeks
ago, in conjunction with Northcliffe',s
brother, Lord Rothermere, absorbed the
11 niton papers and a few others —the little
deal ran into six millions. Beaverbrook
took under his direct control the Evening
Standard and the P'all Mall Gazette.
There is a shocking story apropos his extra-
ordinary capacity for getting hold of things
and running them. When he was being
made a peer he cabled to his brother that
he proposed to call himself Lord Beaver-
brook, and what did his brother think of it?
“Why not Almighty?” came the prompt
reply.
Mrs. Phillip Morton, who died suddenly on
Monday morning, was for 20 years one of
the best-known social figures in Sydney. She
was an artist in life —a born hostess and an
astonishingly effective dresser. It was a
strange thing that the two most radiantly
vigorous types of their generation—lsabel
Morton and Bernhard Wise—should have
contracted the same mysterious complaint—
exophthalmic goitre. Mrs. Morton, with
characteristic courage, sent for Douglas
Shields, faced what is really a major opera-
tion with only a local anaesthetic, and
emerged to all appearances cured. She was
buried in the beautiful little family cemetery
at Coolangatta; her mother (Mrs. David
flay) and several sisters still live in that
village. She leaves three daughters, the
youngest of whom, Rachel Joy, is godchild
of her friend Lady Dudley.
In a week in which marrying and giving
in marriage has been the staple industry,
the dance in aid of the Golden Fleece Kin-
dergarten struck the high note. In the
season it would have been a modest little
affair, submerged by mountainous functions,
but now it was the social seventh wave.
Surgeon McKelvey’s pretty wife and Mrs.
Jack Campbell organised the flutter, which
was staged at the Cavalier. Mrs. McKelvey,
frocked in a souffle of silver lace and tissue,
hostessed one of the largest parties; and
round Mrs. Campbell’s table'was a family
group that included married daughters and
sons-in-law. The Roy Kerrs and the Eakin.
couple formed a party, and Jean Ainsworth,
under secretary Miss Clark-Irving’s wing,
emerged slim and fair from a froth of Per-
sian-blue georgettes.
Michael Tansey threatens to be a runner-
up to John Ferguson in the knot-tying
competition. The young R.C. padre did the
love’s locksmith act the other night on be-
half of theatrical Hugh Ward’s son, Hugh,
lunior, and Muriel Holdsworth. This time
he did it by candle-light in his own St.
Canice’s, the little church round the corner
from Bayswater-road. The bride, who is a
young thing and the only daughter of the
Holdsworths of Woollalira, dressed her big
moment in rich w T hite brocade and a cas-
cade of tulle veiling. Chum Alexia Yates
crowned her blue-and-silver frocking with a
quaint poke-bonnet of baby proportions. The
cake-cutting was done at the Hugh Wards’
home, Bellevue, at Potts Point; and brother
Mel. of the light heels was among the
speech-makers.
When Hugh was courting his girl he was
busy producing a flock of heart-throbs such
as “Why Girls Leave Home” and “Should a
Mother Tell?” at Newtown. Rehearsals took
up three-quarters of the day and perform-
ances all the evening. But were the pair
down-hearted? Not at all! Young Hugh
arranged to pay his respects to the lady every
morning before breakfast. What could pre-
vail against a lover whose castle was built
on such a rock?
Two of Sydney’s old business firms were
linked last week when Enid Roberts, of the
Fairfax-Roberts jewellery clan, whispered
the customary I wills at St. Philip’s to
Edward Hordern, whose father is one of the
“brothers” of Pitt-street; and in her own
right the bride is a belle of Hornsby.
Edward, who gained a captaincy, was sup-
ported by two brother-warriors—Captain
Andrews and Captain Bellamy. The dress-
ing was “frightfully swish,” the bridal attire
being of the new and de luxe blistered-silver,
draped in the new way on the left side, and
trailing a silver tissue train that was split
asunder. Bride and ’groom supplied a sister
apiece for the bridesmaid act, the frocking
thereof being carried out in primrose taf-
fetas crowned with leaf-brown hats. The
bridegroom furthermore pressed padre-
brotlier Hugh into service to help the Arch-
bishop of Melbourne, Dr. Harrington Lees,
«Dply the matrimonial solder. Petty’s spread
the wedding meats, over which the bride’s
mother presided in rich black satin and
Spanish lace.
A long-standing romance was rounded off
the other day when Claud Thompson, one
of the big chiefs of Dalgety’s in Maoriland,
persuaded Jessie McWhannell, of Rodney
Downs (Q.), to brave matrimony and the
winds of Wellington with him. Claud
(Pommy) Thompson is a son of the North
Shore Frewen Thompson familv, and the
McWhannell relations are legion in Sydney.
Littles, Forsytlies and MeWliannells drank
the festive brew at the Queen’s Club after
the ceremony.
The woollen-mills Vicars had a wedding
in the family, too, this week. Malcolm
Vicars, of Wahroonga, persuading Doris
Jtowe, of Vauclnse, to take the irrevocable
step at St. Stephen’s. Bridegroom’s sister
Helen and cousin Jessie Vicars and Dulcie
Cooke bridesmaided in mauve satin and
Limerick lace. The food was eaten at the
Cavalier.
Another bride of the week was sparkling
Pauline Hertzberg, who married her Colonel
Mackenzie with the help of the registrar in
the family flat at the T. and G.
A feminine chip of the strong-chinned
Weigall family whose dad used to head-
master Sydney Grammar was the better half
of a recent marriage at St. James’. Cedric
Chase, of Yanda, was the other moiety. He
is a kind of.cousin, too, liis mother being
a sister to Justice Weigall of Melbourne.
Sylvia Weigall, the small, fair and blue-
eyed lady who breathed the necessary assur-
ance of willingness to share the bridegroom’s
worldly goods, served as a sister with the
A.I.F,
Dorothy Nall, one of the two daughters
of the late Robert Nall, journalist, left Syd-
ney in the Orsova for Bombay, where she
is to marry Robert B. McGillivray, a banker
in India. The couple met over there while
Dorothy was touring with the Merrymakers.
The other Nall girl is the wife 'of tenor
Percy French.
B. E. Minns lias been signing black-and-
white sketches in The Bulletin for 35
years. Now he is holding his first one-man
snow; and it should prove of great interest
to the student as well as the /buyer. In
thAt Jong ago
When Kadi tli
Walker finan-
/ced the first
show of Aus-
tralian Art in
London, the
critics to a
man wrote of
Minns’s water-
colors that
they bore the
u ndeniable
stamp of the
Paris School
of Fine Arts,
though at that
time the
young m a n
had seen
France and
its methods
only through
the eye of
Royal Art
Society instructor Daplyn. Unlike most
geniuses Minns didn’t starve while waiting
for his public. He conquered London with
a bundle of sketches, done up Australian -
wise with brown paper and string. The
first place he called at was the office of St.
Paul’s. They kept the whole packet, and
a few days later Harry Furniss did the
same with the young artist’s second offering
to London. After that success dogged him
to such an extent that he had to buy a
portfolio.
The collection at the New Art Salon on
December 4 will include the water-colors
painted on a trip to the North Coast. Part
of his wandering was done on a timber-
boat ; hence the alluring glimpses of the
Myall River _in the moonlight. Incidentally
Mr. Minns is president of the Australian
Water-color Institute, which holds its first
exhibition next April.
Everybody knows the splendid work done
at Prince Alfred, that little colony where
daily the gift of health is handed out to
young and old Australians. So all Sydney
is behind the Big Push which is timed to
start in the first week of December, though
already the good work has begun. The
retail traders are helping, and the Trade
has pushed 25,000 bottles of beer forward to
fortify tneir particular hole in the dyke.
The takings on the opening night of the
Ambassador’s will make a tinkle in the
treasury. The tickets are £3 3s. and £2
2s. each. That good showman Hugh Ward
is arranging a theatrical garden party; and
on December 19 there’s to be a monster
kiddies’ party at the Exhibition Hall,
Redfern. Shipping knight Owen Cox is
chairman of the Campaign Committee, which
is a very representative body of Sydney's
commercial heavyweights.
Alfred Clint, lived to be 81, and died at
Windsor almost with a paintbrush in his
han d. For
over 50 years
he w a s
actively asso-
ciated wi t h
A u s t r a-
lian theatres,
painting dur-
ing that time
backcloths
for Walter
Montgomery.
C reswick,
Essie Jenyns,
the Ma j-
eronis, and
handsome
George Itig-
nold. His first
big scenic job
was done in
c o n j u n c-
tion with John
Henn i n g s
when at the
old Theatre Royal in Melbourne Montgomery
electrified his audiences with his magnificent
voice in “Antony and Cleopatra.” Next, in
Sydney, he turned the stage of the old Prince
of Wales into an island of enchantment
for “The Tempest.” Pretty Essie Jenvns
made her debut from between the wings' he
had painted for “Cymbeline”; and George
Rignold’s Mark Antony gained dignity from
the surroundings Clint had created. Old
Sydney Punch and the Tribune published
much of his black-and-white work. His only
daughter is the wife of Frank Fox. the well-
known Anglo-Australian journalist. Ilis
sons have mostly followed ‘in their father’s
tracks, as their father followed in his
father’s.
The fete at Lewisham hospital has been
busy spinning money this past week for the
new chapel, which has become a necessity
to the community of heroic women whose
life is spent helping others back to the path
ol health. Dr. Sheehan, the coadjutor-
archbishop, made a modest opening speech,
looking much more like a son of Southern
Europe than of Old Ireland. He dispensed
with a vote of thanks, and with easy but
decisive dignity moved from the dais the
minute his speech was ended; but to make
up there was a ruby-red carpet spread for
his episcopal number eights in the afternoon-
tea tent.
Hr. Trnby King, one of the big chiefs
at the Medical Congress, has been lecturing
in Sydney on the subject nearest his heart,
the proper feeding of baby and the training
ot mother. There’s an Australian Mother-
craft Society in Sydney, and this will be
run on the lines of the Karitane Home at
Dunedin (M.L.). At his lecture in the
Iving s Hall the other night the doctor proved
by slides that even a vegetable may take
the wrong turning if Mother Nature injudi-
ciously nourishes him.
The “Welcome” across the doormat of
Australia lias drawn the Stork’s attention,
and he is busy peopling Australia with the
best kind of immigrant. The Royal Hospi-
tal for Women at Paddington flies a 2000-
per-annum record of brand-new arrivals, and
only a clever strategist like Matron Clark
could deal with the housing problem The
wonst present difficulty is with the nursing
staff. But, fortunately, the Royal has mag-
nificent grounds, and there is plenty of space
for the institution to spread. It is 102
years since the first baby was born in the
hospital, and the 2000 yearly happenings
are now supplemented by a small army at-
tended in their own homes by the' out-
patients’ staff. Visitors to the hospital the
other day discovered one mother nursing
her own twelfth Royal-born baby. There’s
a building fund, of course; and it is just
ravenous for Christmas cheques.
The girls of St. 1 incent’s are arranging a
seven days’ fair in aid of the schools and
hospitals run by their beloved Sisters of
Charity. Through the first days of Decem-
ber the spacious grounds of the College at
Potts Point will be the scene of the gay
marketing.
On _ November SO the workers at St.
James’s will be at home in the crypt to re-
ceive anything in the way of men’s clothing,
new or left-off. Boots are particularly asked
for. The committee has been doing splen-
did work in getting jobs for the unemployed,
but so many of the men are destitute of
clothes in which to go to the new job.
. There’s to be a Christmas party for the
kiddies at the Wentworth on December 14,
engineered by Mrs. W. P. McElhone and
Mrs. A. B. Shand. The Deaf and Dumb
Appeal will benefit. Parents who are tak-
ing parties are asked to communicate with
the secretaries, telephone 83392.
Friends and admirers of the late Leonard
►Stephen are contributing to the “Leonard
►Stephen Memorial Gymnasium," the idea
being to keep his memory green and help the
Boys’ Brigade, in which he was interested for
nearly 30 years. The committee includes
Geoffrey Fairfax, Reg limes. Charles
J acpies, F. de V. Lamb, Eustace Fosbery and
other well-known men, and W. P. McElhone
is taking the subscriptions.
The Cavalier Club has transferred, for
the purposes of its Wednesday deliberations
on Art and Literature, to the Australia.
Originally formed with the object of bring-
ing the intelligentsia together in a sociable
way, it is now largely composed of con-
firmed Government Housers. Thea Proctor.
George Lambert and Sid Smith were about
the only pukka artists in evidence at the
last roll-up.
The decision in the Lubrano case has
caused the Sydney woman to raise her eye-
brows till they have tickled her thinking
apparatus into action: and she says it's
high time there were women jurors in
divorce cases. It takes an Australian
woman used to mixing with her fellows to
understand the psychology of another Aus
tralian woman in the same boat. As the
case may go on to another trial it might be
unfair to remark upon the man-jury's ver-
dict; but, on general principles, what does
a jury mean when it gives an injured hus-
band a farthing damages? Does it mean
doubt about the value of the lady, or about
the value of its own verdict? Or what does
it mean?
Arthur Streeton. who is that rare thing
among artists, a successful business man.
judges the time ripe for an auction sale.
For the encouragement of the shy bidder
the front page of the catalogue details the
rise in value of five of Streeton’s canvases
during the past 15 years. And, lest the
reader may not have a ready-reckoner brain,
there’s a footnote that this increase aver-
ages 600 per cent. After the pound ster-
ling has trailed her glittering robe on the
front page, Art, with an almost apologetic
air, takes up the parable on the inner sheet.
Streeton’s much-admired “Golden Summer,”
painted in Heidelberg (Vic.) in 1888, heads
the list of works that Lawson will auction to-
day (29th) in Farmer’s Exhibition Hall.
The 7th Field Engineers will hold their
annual reunion to-morrow evening at the
Cafe Felix, in King-street. There’s a hand-
shake (and other things) waiting for the
member, ot any other field eo. who may be in
Sydney.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex., heading a party of 40, went off through
the cane lands to Coolun beach the other day and
opened the new line there. There was a cheerful
lunch under the trees; Nambour was rediscovered
at -6, and then the 40 left for Brisbane.
The Authors and Artists’ Assoc, last week voted
an honorarium of £l5 to the hon. sec., E. Col-
clough, but he insisted on the money going towards
prizes for the best poem and best pictures in con-
nection with Brisbane’s centenary celebrations.
Marie Bjelke Peterson is off to the Apple Isle
with copy gleaned about Bananaland for a new book.
Marjorie Barnes Cory, of Long-reach, daughter of
the late C. J. Cory, of Hughenden station, ex-
changed I wills with Georgf? C. Coar, of Rock-
hampton, at St. Andrew’s, Padre B. C, Wilson being
there to hear. The bride’s mother gave a
rvedding dinner afterwards ere the pair went Sydney-
wards a-honeymooning.
Miss Bourne, late of St. Hilda’s, the other dav
raked in many good wishes and a wallet of notes
from the Old Girls of the school in the National
roof-garden amid a purpling of larkspurs.
With Michael Rogers in attendance, his Ex. went
to the Musical Union concert, taking the Wool-
cocks and Ryders, Gladys Pollard, the Joan Robert-
son and Denniss maidens along with him. Lena
Hammond, in coral and gold and black, and
Stephanie Hebden, in blue and green, sang the solos.
At Coolangatta the other night the picture
theatre and electric light co.’s works were destroyed
by fire. A resourceful housemaid at the near-by
Grande Hotel was the first to see the flames and rang
tlie dinner-bell. It was 2 a.m., but the boarder?
responded, a bucket brigade was organised, and the
pub was saved.
Mrs. Robert Bell's pupils carolled in the Elite on
the 21st and attracted thereby much vegetation.
Among the performers were Mrs. Bell, Ruth Port-
raite, Gladys Powell, Sara Isaacs (a comely girl),
Jack Allen, W. Crisp and Bobby Kaye; and in the
full house were Dr. and Mrs. Morgan Lane, the
E. K. Brodribbs and many other well-knowns. Mrs.
Brodvibb gave a supper party at the Eitz after-
wards, Mrs. Robert Bell and elocutionist Daphne
Baime (Vic.) being among the bidden.
Oxley landed at Brisbane for the second time last
week with an accompaniment of yelling aboriginals
from the Barambah mission, who did their yelling
under the direction of Parson Leacock. Norman
Pixley steered the Mermaid up the fiver, and one
Moeeatta became Oxley for the time being. As
well as applause, shekels were raked in for - the
Children’s Hospital.
At Longreach recently, Alice Monckton, eldest
daughter of the late Wm. Duncan, of Morraberrie,
Windorah, was married to Fred Clifford, second son
of the late W. F. Kemp, of Port Macquarie. Padre
Wilson, a battalion cobber of the ’groom, did the
deed.

Mayoress Brunton, aided and abetted by
wives of lesser city fathers, beckoned the
Swanson dame into her Town Hall recep-
tion-chamber the other afternoon to bestow
upon the deposed lady a dressing-case richly
equipped with silver. The presentation was
sandwiched between tea and song and talk.
Mrs. Brunton was in soft grey silk running
over with black braiding. The guest, who
was in black and carried a gift of red roses,
spoke her thanks under stress of genuine
emotion; but she managed to smile through
the threatening mist of tears, being heart-
ened thereto by pats on the arm from her
kindly hostess. The Mayor came in for
some creamed strawberries half-way through
the party, after being assured that he would
not be tie trap. Before the crowd trooped
downstairs to face the camera Mrs. Brunton
called for a farewell cheer for the popular
Mrs. Cabeua, who has not been feeling fit
of late and is tripping off to Ceylon with
her aldermanic other half.
The lawn-tennis carnival at the Albert
Ground on Saturday happened under a blis-
tering sun. Most of the garments were
made for ventilation, but there were some
clinging confections with the wandering
girdles patronised by the late Mrs. Tutank-
hamen. Most of the girls on the courts
were in plain starched frocks, but the beau-
teous Miss de Bavay struck the populace
with a silver-belted frock and nifty white
sandals. She was only approached in
smartness by Pat O’Hara Wood, in a sweater
adorned by a pale-blue V on the chest and
ringed at the wrist with the same swmet color.
The woolly sweaters of Patterson and
Hawkes are similarly decorated in -maroon
and black, so the day of the tangerine,
mauve and squashed-tomato effects cannot
be far away. Perhaps next season we shall
have some of them trimmed with love-knots
and old lace.
All the Nicest turned out, including con-
tingents from both vice-regal houses. On the
stands around the championship courts
women bravely faced the possibilities of sun-
stroke without brollies, but Mrs. Pitt Rivers
shielded her good looks with one of the new
gaily-tinted baby sunshades. Lady Forster,
fearful of blocking the view of the back-
seaters, screened off the danger with an
ermine stole and her programme.
Toorak is congratulating Ken Austin and
Jean Gilruth, who have .just agreed to seal
a romance of their school days with an
orange-blossom ceremony shortly. He is
the second hope of the Western District
Bertie Austins, and she the daughter of
rugged vet.-surgeon Gilruth, one-time Admin-
istrator of the N. Territory. The Austins
are dividing their attentions between the
newly-engaged pair and the heir of eldest
son Tom, who has just made his baby
bow to the world.
The James Angus, Russell Gabb and
Barry Thompson matrons staged a cheerful
one-stepping frivol in the Ormond Hall for
the helpers in the Egyptian revue at the
Alfred Hospital fete. As the hostessing trio
saw to it that wallflowers did not mar the
mural decorations, everyone had a thrilling
time. Mrs. Angus was handsomely sheathed
in black and silver caught at the hip with
something that had an opalescent glitter;
Mrs. Gabb radiated in black silk with the
drapings washed back to a side mooring of
rhinestones; and Mrs. Barry Thompson’s
pearl-grey satin twinkled through a georgette
veil weighted with shimmering beads.
Walter Kirby is packing his bathing togs
for a season of surfing by the Harbor. Kirby
simply adores the water —if he were a fairy,
like lolanthe, he’d probably live in a pond
among the frogs. He sang his farewell song
at the Liedertafel concert, and the audience
nearly clapped the skin off its palms in its
demand for double encores.
Burns-Philp’s manager Stokes and Morti-
mer, the Marella’s cheerful skipper, were
jointly responsible for a party on Satur-
day afternoon. Mrs. Stokes, attractively
frocked in blue silk under a black lid, wel-
e med the guests alongside the top gang-
way, and the programmed events succeeded
each other with clocklike precision. There
v iS music, an inspection of the boat, after-
noon tea in the marble-walled dining-saloon
and a lecturette on “The Lure of the East”
by Dr. Floss Greig. And through it all the
efficiency of the Chinee boys stewarding the
Marella almost brought tears to the eyes of
harassed housewives. John Mackey con-
voyed his lady, who mounted a black feath-
ery-edged hat suggesting a fight in the barn-
yard ; Dr. James Barrett spent a happy
afternoon with his pleasant dame, his daugh-
ter Cara and the Albert Miller widow.
Jimmy Dyer defied a hurt foot to fetch his
feminine half, who sported an almond-green
hat with Nile lilies which would have slain
a less admirable complexion; and Mrs.
MacDonald and daughter Meg, just back
from their American trip, aired some well-
shaped Paisley effects. The medical Siuclairs,
the Edward Bateses and the Harry Emrtier-
ton pair were also on deck.
Ex-Anzac Padre Maund, a former vicar of
St. Martin’s, Hawksburn, who has just fare-
welled his Ballarat parishioners before
steaming to England with his wife and
family to take up clerical duties there, un-
veiled St. Martin’s annual garden bazaar in
the vicarage grounds on Saturday afternoon,
vicar Green seconding the opening oration.
Great business was done by the amateur
shopkeepers, and in the evening proceedings
were further gladdened by a dance.
The deceptiveness of appearances was de-
monstrated during the strike trouble by two
superior-looking young women who wetfe
sworn in as voluntary waitresses at the
Town Hall. The pair explained that they
had lately crossed from Sydney, where they
were well known, and their testimony w r as
backed up by a brace of well-groomed
“specials.” The new helps were getting well
into their stride when a couple of detectives
hove in sight, wdiereupon the twain faded
away. “A pair of well-known Sydney
crooks,” explained one ’tec. “But two of
the ‘specials’ assured us they knew them,”
wailed the rnatron-in-charge. “Oh,” came
the reply, “they have gone too!” One bright
little sassiety flapper nearly swooned when
she heard it.
Mrs. .Tim Purves and daughter Valerie
narrowly missed providing sensational head-
lines for the dailies last week. While they
were waiting to board a Bourke-street tram
after the “Pygmalion” matinee a motor-
hog mowed them down—and didn’t wait
to see what damage he’d done. Fortunately
neither was seriously hurt.
An appallingly wet night failed to wash
back the crowd from the South Yarra Tennis
Club’s fox-trotting welcome to the inter-
state players. It was a joyous, friendly
gathering. Norman Brookes, as patron of
the club, brought his wife, who took the
floor in inky trappings. Mrs. Haynes had
black lace veiling white satin under a black
straight-jacket body. The Jack McComas pair
were there, she all a-glitter with black
sequins. Mrs. Arthur Barraclough (formerly
Essa D’Ebro) sported silver panniers over
blue silk, and handsome Mrs. Charlie Lyon
was a delicate blush of pinky satin with green
leaves banding her brown hair. Among
Sydneysiders were Sylvia Lance, the St.
George maideh, and Mrs. J. McGough, Nor-
man Peach. L. and W. Willard and Dr.
Plomlev.
This charming face belongs to Madge
Currie, a talented Western District damsel,
w ho h u n g
three land-
scapes in the
A r ic. Artists'
Society’s 1923
Spring show
in the East Mel-
bourne Gal-
leries. These
were painted
in France and
Italy when
the young
lady was
studying
abroad after
laying the
foundation of
her artistic
knowledge in
her native
Australia. The
youthful paint-
r e s s is a
daughter of
the woolly Sibbald Curries, of Ettrick, Cam-
perdown, and grand-daughter of the late
Kobert Murray Smith, of liepton, Toorak—
a leading politician, a noted business man
and a patron of all the arts.
The C. M. Lloyd widow and her insepar-
able pal, Millie Carter, who left Melbourne
early in the war to settle in England, landed
back again the other day quite convinced
that Australian sunshine is too good to be
missed. Till they find a nest for themselves
they are sheltering at Menzies’.
A female section of the Very Best gath-
ered on Toorak St. Catherine’s well-sliaven
lawns at the invitation of the Misses
Templeton and Langley to see a charming
eurhythmic display by over 40 schoolgirls
with silver-filleted locks, stockinged feet
and short white tupics panelling their trim
knickerbockers fore and aft. When the
display was over the girls helped to pass the
tea and ice-creams to their elders in the ball
and dining rooms, and then went off to un-
limited ice-creams with a group of small
boys in a tent on the front lawn. Among
the guests was the octogenarian William
Templeton widow, who was having her first
outing after being prisoned by a cold for
weeks. Bishop Langley also dropped in.
St. Catherine’s was formerly Kilbryde, the
home of the Scobie Mackinnons, and before
that it sheltered the Buckleys as Beaulieu.
It is one of the most roomy mansions in the
superiah suburb, and would probably have
been the State vice-regal residence but for
the Government’s decision to hire and not
buy.
Eugene Conway, the P’ran boot-merchant
whose wife was lately granted a separation,
is the second-last member of a family that
has had more than its share of tragedy. His
old father, who died some years ago, left a
six-figure fortune, whose foundations were
laid by hawking footwear in the infancy of
the suburb; but only Eugene, a brother and
a sister (since deceased) were left to inherit
their parent’s cash. The others passed out
mostly in circumstances of distressing poig-
nancy. Eugene Conway was a kindly, gentle
fellow in his youth, and numerous old friends
of his dead relatives can only look upon his
present with profound sympathy.
Artist Fred Reynolds, wdiose face appears
hereabout, got his early training at South
Kensington and the British Museum, after
which some
flaw in the
artistic tem-
perament sent
hint to farin-
ing for a
couple of
year s, pre-
luded by a
Dookie College
course. But
the old call
proved too
strong. and
Reynolds with-
drew his hand
fro m the
plough and
s t a m p e de d
back to the
city, dug his
palette and
paint-box from
the dust, and
—there he is.
Pigs and cows no longer appeal to him save
as models now. Last year he dashed off
to England to liven up his acquaintance
with ancient and. contemporary art. and
after landing back in Melbourne had a suc-
cessful little exhibition at the Athenseum
all to himself. Rembrandt made this picture
of him.
Little 'Wilma Berkeley has got a day’s
march nearer her debut. Before sailing for
Australia Dame Nellie wound up the French
and English end of her vocal training with a
final series of lessons, and then ordered the
little songbird off to Italy under Auntie Ada
Casey’s wing to acquire the dinkum Italian
accent.
Dr. Cedric Cohen, son of the Sydney
.Judge, kept a matrimonial appointment with
Bibs Benjamin at her parents’ home in
Queen’s-road the other night, with about 30
relatives to witness the tryst. The bride,
richly arfliored in silver under a tulle veil
moored to her head with orange flowers, was
cheered to the sacrifice by sister Nell in
white georgette and silver lace, with a pink
and blue bouquet. Colyn Cohen seconded
his bridegroom brother. At No. 9 Darling-
street, where the after-shivoo was, Mrs.
Louis Benjamin hostessed in jetted black,
gladdened by a pink hand-posy. The bride’s
mother was silver-greyed like a seagull, with
a dash of mauve on the side wings to match
the sweet-peas bunched in her hand. Eric
Benjamin had rushed over from Sydney with
his wife to see his sister take the plunge.
On Friday the streets of Melbourne
gleamed redly with poppies—excellent imita-
tions of the real thing—which were sold for
the Tubercular Soldiers’ cause and in re-
membrance of fallen Anzacs. Dorothy Brun-
ton and Josie Melville, with a squad of atten-
dant mummers, did a good trade in the morning
at the Anzac House portico, where General
Coxen’s wife and two pretty daughters com-
bined with ex-Mayoress Stein to unload a
ton or so of flowers, real and artificial, and
various other trifles. Kathleen Malone and
the Colling maiden looked after a pitch by
the Centreway.
Appendicitis has finished off Malcolm
Skqrrie, one of Melbourne’s well-known elo-
cutionists and impersonators of Dickens char-
acters. Appearances with Repertory Society
and other playgivers marked him as above
the average; and his resonant voice was a
thing to admire.
With his beaming wife Charlie Andrews,
formerly the uncrowned king of Boort, cele-
brated his golden wedding the other day at
St. Kilda, and had a family gathering. lie
is president of Melbourne Bowling Club, and

foregather and discuss bias, wicks, kitties
and other things.
The David Hennessy widow is disbanding
her roomy flat at White Lodge, South Yarra,
and with Jier three daughters will trip off
next month by the Mongolia. They will have
a few weeks in the south of France and
Italy, and a further period among the
winter snows at St. Moritz, before crossing
the Channel in time for the English Spring
and the Empire Exhibition.
The Geoff Symes’ 18-year-old daughter
Hilaria became engaged during her over-
seas trip, the other person in the case being

One special constable has been badly
ragged by his comrades over a call made at
the Town Hall by his mother and bride of a
couple of months. They brought with them
a bunch of lilies which they requested should
be placed “in his room.” One of the wits
dubbed the unfortunate victim of feminine
solicitude Santa Filomena, presented him
with a piece of palm, and quoted Longfellow:
Not even shall be wanting here
The palm, the lily and the spear,
The symbols that of yore
Saint Filomena bore.
And the “special” thought of all the biting
things he would like to say when he returned
home.
Shall we ever see the like at Flemington ?
In a recent Movie Gazette the film showed
a horse named The Clown winning a race at
San Francisco. Afterwards fussy young
females handed up bouquets and baskets of
flowers to the jockey, and he received the?
vegetables with the smirk of a prima donna.
They even hung wreaths on the neck of The
Clown. A small Australian jockey in the
house spat forcibly and ejaculated “Aw —
rot!”
Middle-aged musical Melbourne is mourn-
ing the death of George Weston, the first
violin of many impressive orchestras and
the right-hand man of Frederic Cowen’s
concerts. He was never starred and head-
lined like an imported genius, but lie was the
very heart of the world of “strings” in those
early Melbourne days. His educational value
shows, in much of the solid orchestral worth
of many violinists of to-day, thouglj the fact
is rarely acknowledged.
A line or two from Adelaide:—
Our summer has been forgetting itself. For the
Port Adelaide Club’s November meeting at Chelten-
ham, heavy coats and furs were thy wear as
far as women went, and only keen racegoers plucked
enough courage to face the wind and squalls. The
lucky few who motored down to Birkafla for the
opening of the polo season turned; their cars with
their backs to the wind and tucked themselves into
the deepest; recesses to watch their men folk more
or less - distinguish themselves, while the mere
train travellers were almost blown out of the stand
that backs on to the railway siding. At the Fullar-
ton fete in aid of the Home for Incu/rables, the
stallholders had to hang on to their wares with one
hand and sell with the other, if they didn’t want the
whole contraption to be swept into the street. Lady
Bridges gave the show its kick-off.
The Geoffrey Duffields, who said good-bye to us a
couple of months ago, will be heading southwards
again at the beginning of the year, with Canberra
as their objective. A host of congratulations will
go to him from this State on being given charge
of-the Federal Government’s brand-new observatory.
The Wright-Morey wedding was a strictly “rela-
tives and close friends only” affair. Headmaster
Bickersteth tied the knot in the St. Peter’s College
chapel; the bride’s uncle, Mr. McDonnell, gave her •
away, and there were tea and good-byes for the
intimate few at Miss McDonnell’s afterwards.
There was a purely medical luncheon at Govern-
ment House the other day (that is as regards guests:
not food), with Sir William Macewen, on his way
back home from the Melbourne congress, as principal
guest and half a dozen local medicoes to meet him.
The exodus to Victor Harbor has begun. Ladv
Bridges has been down, but only for a
flying visit, with Girl Guides as her objective.
A company has been duly launched at the Harbor,
with Dr. Douglas’s eldest daughter as acting captain
and Mrs. O’Leary as president.
Mrs. C. Hayward and her daughter, Mrs. A. G.
Price and Mrs. J. Henderson joined forces as host-
esses for a garden party at the first-mentioned's
house in North Adelaide, and the guests ran to a
couple of hundred, all ruffling it gladly in their
Spring finery, which has been languishing in boxes
f’rages while much-tried winter raiment has been
doing overtime.
There is a wedding afoot in the Paddy Glynn
family—that of daughter Joan, who is to say “I
will” to Frank O’Collins in January. There’ll be
no lack of padres to do the knot-tying, as one of
the prospective bridegroom’s brothers is assistant-
priest at St. Mary’s, Geelong, and another has just
arrived from- Rome fresh from his ordination.
Leslie Holliday, though still a legal infant, has
come to grief again in S. Aus. Chief Justice
Murray reminded him that he had left behind him
in N.S.W. five previous convictions and an unlawful
baby. In Adelaide he posed as the son of wealthy
parents, also as brother of various film favorites,
advertised for young girls at £4 a week
to act for the screen, and then asked them to pay
£2 a week for instruction. One of them, a goo«*
deal younger even than himself, was induced to
leave her home with him; and for this the Court
thought he was getting off pretty lightly with two
years and nine months. At the same time Adelaide
was chuckling over a breach-of-promise case between
a spinster of 61 and a man of 70. She claimed
£lOOO. Judge Parsons gravely instructed the jury
that, Oven allowing a breach of contract, they must
consider whether her chance of marrying someone
else had been seriously injured; but they thought
the damage to her young affections worth £3OO.

SORE ATCh TACKLE
A fine performance was that of the 14.2
Maoriland pony Egyptian Flower in winning the
Farm Stakes at Randwick from end to end. She
looked a very frail little thing as she was led round
by a stable-boy, and many punters stood off her on
that account, but she fairly outstayed a big field,
galloping the mile in lmin. 40sec. The undersized
chestnut was foaled by the English mare Mint, and
the book is uncertain whether the sire was Egypt,
a brother to Desert 'Gold, or the Victorian-bred Fin-
land. Quoted in the ring at 10’s, she was one of
five winners more or less profitable to Me Short odds,
the others being Tuckbridge (7’s), Belle Shot (10’s;,
Bowna (12’s), and Cheerful (14’s). Bowna is a
great bookmakers’ horse. Twice- supported for a
ton of money, he had failed the public miserably in
mile welters, but in the 11-furlongs Warwick Handi-
cap he came right away from a respectable field and
won, easing up, from Kerryland, Honey Bee and
Tremolo. Someone backed him, but not "the public,
and there was no inquiry.
* * * *
Wish Wynne and Julia Grey have been
travelling well on the Randwick tracks, and, if
they keep right, one or other may have to be reckoned
with in the A.J.C. Villiers Stakes, to be run on
Dec. 22. Wish Wynne has 9st. 41b. and Julia 9st.
—only 31b. more than she carried to victory in a
very good Doncaster 20 months ago. Popaway (Bst.
21b.) and Bardoleur (7st. 131 b.) are also nicely
handicapped, but the latter is going to Melbourne,
his party having designs on one of the Autumn
sprints. And there may yet be a good race in
Teremarau (7st. 31b.), who was running on well at
tlie end of Cheerful’s mile handicap on Saturday,
after striking trouble during the journey. For the
Summer Cup, Master Cagou (7st. 101 b.), on his
second to Note in City Tattersall’s Cup, and El
Dorado (7st. 31b.), on his second to Comptroller in
the A.J.C. Waverley Handicap, are a likely pair.
And there is Kashmir (7st. 4ib.), who shows signs
of returning to the fine form he displayed as a four-
year-old, when he chased Prince Charles home in
the Sydney Cup. Julia Grey and El Dorado is a
rather attractive double—or would be if one could
be certain the mare is as good as she was, and that
the beautifully-bred All Black horse will shake off
the soreness which troubles his industrious trainer
and reach the post cherry-ripe.
* * * *
“F.A.”: It is becoming fashionable to
work rejuvenated stunts at N-.S.W. country meetings
(B. 22/11/’23). In the latest case there were six
starters, and the mob secured 2 to 1 about their
good thing—liberal odds enough, for, excepting their
second string, which was being run in another owner’s
name, the field consisted of hairy goats. The good
thing won, but the “owner” of the second horse
protested on the ground that the winner had won
a stake which made him ineligible. Betting on the
protest soon became brisk, and quite a number of
bookies were found ready to lay a shade of odds that
the protest would be upheld, for it got about that
a wire, purporting to be from a race official, affirmed
that the winner had won a race and prize money
enough to put the kibosh on him. The final decision
in the matter was deferred till the stewards had
time to get the trunk telephone, which gave the
mob a chance to dump a few more quid on the Winner.
A few minutes before the next race started several
robust odds-yellers almost fell off. their candle-boxes
at the sight of the “Protest Dismissed” flag running
up the pole.
* * * *
The Sport of Kings is only good enough
for the most hardened commoners in Melbourne
these times —excepting, of course, the V.R.C. Bene-
volent Fund meeting, billed for Moonee Valley this
Saturday. But they have important happenings
down the line occasionally. Switch, previously out
of sorts, recovered her form last Saturday and won
the Epsom Handicap nicely. The stable let her
go out at 8 to 1, forgetting that this has been a
great season for mares. Ouverte, another of the
sex, followed Switch home, whilst Polynesian, backed
at 2 to 1, gave one of his bad exhibitions. Earlier
in the afternoon, Waranton, owned by the Chaffeys,
carried top weight to the fore in the Epsom Plate
(six furlongs)—another reminder that the St. Antons
are a slippery family. A remarkable event, all
things considered, was the victory of Wamridgee, at
33’s, in the Two-year-old Handicap, with L. Frank-
lin aboard. The despised outsider won easily. And
what breeding for a despised outsider! By All
Black, from Artilerie.
“Bond.”: Ever hear of a bird being dis-
qualified for fraud after winning a race? ft has
just happened in Belgium. The homing pigeons were
taken to a distant city by aeroplane, which at once
returned with the cages. Then an owner, proud but
puzzled, reported that his bird had arrived at the
loft in a time which made hay of all the records.
It seemed incredible —till someone remembered having
seen a pigeon move out, when the ’plane finally
stopped, from a sheltered corner, in which it had
made the whole return journey, except the last half-
mile or so to its loft.
* * * *
A notable addition to the list of - horse-
owners in Adelaide is Frank Downer, who lately
went on the committee of S.A. Jockey Club, and
has bought a daughter of Desert Rose to start racing
with. Downer is more famous in the polo- and
hunting-fields. He was Master of Adelaide Hunt
Club long ago, and has just been reappointed vice-
captain of the Polo Club, of which Gordon Law
Smith remains captain.

“Batt C.” : A stranger turned up at a West-
ern line (N.S.W.) pub the other week and mentioned
to Bung over a drink that he had had a bit of luck
with Tatt.’s. He produced a ticket and a result
list showing that he was entitled to a cash prize
of £lOO, and borrowed a fountain-pen to endorse
the ticket. The stranger then asked Mr. Pintpot if,
he would mind the remunerative reply being
addressed to the pub, as he didn’t want the mob out
at the station to know about the win. Next he
wrote the hotel address on the document and gave
it to Bung to be posted. After a few days’ stay
he borrowed £2O on the strength of what was
coming to him, and left for the station, intimating
that he would be back for a blow-out by the time
the dough came from Hobart. When a letter duly
arrived for the station-hand, post-marked Hobart,
Bung obligingly sent the addressee a notification that
the lucre had arrived, and received a reply from
some bewildered person to the effect that he' didn’t
know anything about the affair and had never
bought a Tatt.’s ticket in his life. With scant
hesitation, the victim of misplaced trust went to
the letter rack and, grabbing the missive, tore it
open. What he read therein prompted him to write
to the Speck, and in due course he received a full
explanation of the joke that had been put up on
him. The winning ticket number was 44769, but the
ticket drawn by the Legpull Syndicate, repre-
sented by the stranger, was 44796. The two last
figures had been neatly cut out, turned end for end,
and replaced in the aperture.

Had Eddie Butcher boxed Louis Flees as
he boxed Henri Dupont he would probably have
adorned his belt with another foreign scalp, being
the faster and cleverer man. But he adopted
slatherum-whaek tactics against a tough-jawed
Fleming who could take it and come again, and in
the seventh round of as furious a fight as Sydney
Stadium has seen, a sueculative right-hander bn the
chin sent the Westralian down and out.

Stadium. Pandong, who looks like Jacky Green

Ristuecia was licked by Purdy, the Maorilander, in

Owing to delays in the earlier part of its
week’s programme, the Vic. Lawn Tennis Assoc,
couldn’t finish off the whole of its tournament on
Saturday. All the same, it partially gratified a
packed house, sweltering in the first burst of summer
heat, with some tolerable tennis. In the semi-final
of the singles, between Schlesinger and O’Hara
Wood, the latter’s adroitness in volley play, coupled
with his punishing service, was too good for Scnles-
inger, whose slavish adherence to the drive in all
his troubles is rot bringing him any nearer to the
future that the sapient critics have* promised him.
A one-sided battle ended in a 3-set-to-l victory
for Wood. In the next semi-final, Norman Peach
went down after three sets with the burly Patterson.
In the first two chapters Peach could do little
with Patterson’s service, but in the final round he
scored better, and held the lead at 4—3 and 6—5.
At the latter stage, however, Patterson, with one
of his disconcerting flashes of brilliancy, took three
games and the match with little interference from
the valiant Ma Stater. The doubles final, Patterson
- —Hawkes v. Thomas —Wood was the longest and
dul.est scramble of the day. Wood was slack and
timorous, and it was mainly due to Thomas, who
shone in the rallies with winning volleys and played
prettily in other ways, that the pair collared the
second and. third sets, the latter with the loss of
only one game. After the interval Patterson and
Hawkes changed their tactics, and getting more
bite into their service, whilst plastering the empy-
rean with soft lobs to keep the enemy back from
the net, registered a 6—o majority. The last set
was almost equally decisive. Wood, who was
committing egregious errors (an ankle hurt in the
Schlesinger match was worrying him), found Thomas
failing at critical moments, with the result that
the others ran out at 6—2. Patterson did most of
the work; his partner committed numerous faults
on his first service and made some ludicrous attempts
at “kills.”
Pat O’Hara Wood, who entered for every section
of the Vic. tennis championships, paid the penalty
for his ability on Saturday by having to appear in
the final of the mixed doubles as well as in the
aforesaid singles and doubles. A season or so back
Jack Hawkes had a front part in every performance
on the final day ; he was a very tired and bedraggled
youth at the end of the show. So, in the heat of
Saturday, O’Hara Wood began to droop under the
weight of his engagements and the pain of his
damaged ankle, and the crowd rarely saw him at
his best. In the circumstances, the'gate wouldn't
have suffered if some other items had been substi-
tuted for the semi-finals of the singles, and thus
left Patterson and Wood fresh for the inevitable
gruelling encounter in the doubles. There is no
doubt that some rearrangement of this sort would
have been productive of brighter tennis. The fact
that o—l was registered by one side, only to be
eclipsed by a 6 —o by the other, showed a swing in
form for which fatigue on both sides was in some
measure accountable. On Monday Wood was unable
to meet Patterson, and Gerald collected the Vic.
singles for the fifth successive year.
* * * *
“15-30”: There were many old-timers at
the Albert Ground, Melbourne, when Norman Brookes
reappeared in the doubles with Rod Heath as his
partner. There is no evidence of deterioration in
the veteran’s fast, sparkling service. One marvelled
at the efficiency with which his beautifully-placed
balls often caught his opponents with helpless rac-
quets, or compelled them to register “outs.-” And it
was all done with the minimum of effort. In serv-
ing Norman merely bends the knee slightly as the
racquet meets the ball, and the missile maintains
its low flight even when carrying the maximum of
spin. In his ground work there is the same non-
chalant placing of uncomfortable shots, and his
sharp-angled volleys are as speedy as ever they were.
Barring a loss of steam, which one must expect at
his age, I consider that he is still the greatest of
tennis technicians ; incomparably greater as a stroke-
merchant than Patterson, and only approached in
resource by O’Hara Wood. When you see these two
in a volleying duel you behold tennis of Davis Cup
standard. Hawkes . is a good volleyer, and has
streaks of real brilliancy, but for crafty change of
pace and placement commend me to Brookes and
Wood.
* * *
“Linesman”: Tlie conclusion I have de-
rived from the tennis championships in Melbourne
is that Anderson would have beaten all the Vic-
torians if he hadn’t stayed sulking in his Sydney
tent. On his day, O’Hara Wood might push J. 0.,
but Wood is not reproducing the form he
showed in Britain and America last year. Hawkes
might also snatch a set from the tall Cornstalk, for
he is now hitting hard and surely, though he is still
too satisfied to smack a ball into play, instead of
trying for sharp-angled aces along the side lines.
Jack’s steadiness and caution are merely doubling
his work, and one needs to save all unnecessary
energy in a close match. As for Patterson, I can’t
imagine his ever defeating Anderson again. Let me
admit that his service is unrivalled in Australia; at
its best it is more productive of straight-out winners
than Tilden’s. I grant also the spectacular ferocity
of his smashes, albeit he often shapes like a beginner
in dealing summarily with a half-court lob. But
what has Patterson in defence when the other fellow
is pelting in relentlessly on his backhand? For a
start, he holds his racquet wrongly. No amount of
advice has induced him to change the fatal, habit of
scooping up his backhand shots with an action that is
more a slice than a wallop. Work him out of
position into his forehand court, as artists like
Tilden and Johnston would inevitably do, and the
returns on his backhand make him an easy victim.
A little while ago it wae proudly announced that his
backhand had greatly improved. I venture to say
it is worse. Too free’-"•fitly it is a girlish pat,
ludicrously ineffectual against a first-class man.
* * * *
A useful industry sot a lift when the
N. S. Wales L.T.A. decided that the Barnet Glass ball
was up to the standard required, for representative
tennis. The Australian article is to he used in
Sydney next month throughout the country p’ayers
tournament, which has grown to be about the
biggest thing of kind in the world.
“Machete”: Arne Borg, the Swedish swim-
mer, is on his wav to Australia to meet Beaurepaire
and Charlton. Borg is at his best over the middle
distances, and has been allotted a world’s-record cer-
tificate for his spin over 880 yards in. llmin.
9 l-10sec. at Gothenburg. In Sydney last season
Charlton got over the 880yds. in llmin. 5 l-ssec., but
a record certificate was denied him because he had
swum in tidal water. Charlton, after an unpromis-
ing start, is working into form, and another dan-
gerous opponent for the Swede will be Moss Christie,
who has learned a lot of wrinkles, from Ludy Langer.
Heaps of runs were made in Sydney on
Saturday. For Western Suburbs (2 for 405) v.
Central Cumberland Warren Bardsley got 200 n.o.
and his brother 105 n.o. ; for Gordon (5 for 528) v.
St. George Moyes smote 174 and Macartney 142 ; and
to Waverley’s 4 for 307 v. Uni. Davis contributed
111, Kippax 108 and Collins 100. Moyes hit nine
sixers and/ 22 fours, and scored at the rate of nearly
two runs a minute. The stalwart Digger is in
splendid form, and it is a pity South Australia can’t
requisition his services for Sheffield Shield cricket
this season; unless one of the regulars drops out he
is not likelv to get a game for N.S.W. The Ma

trundler showing- consistently good form. He Ims:
taken 25 wickets at 11.60. Fast-bowler Scott; who,
like Gregory, has a “leg,” has bagged 23 at 14.65;
and Mailey’s total is 36 at-23.33. Nobody else has
done much.

“Tren”; When Victoria had two such
slow bowlers as Armstrong and.Hartkopf (they were star
batsmen also) the State selectors became accustomed
to pass over the claims of Olarrie Grimmett, who
was a more successful pennant bowler than either,
but lacked brilliancy with the bat. Last year the
big fellow did not play, and good bowlers were
sought in desert places and along all the tributaries
of the Murray, but the selectors overlooked Grim-
mett again. Yet his bag of wickets (68) was 22
more than that of his nearest competitor in pennant
cricket, and his average (11.52), was easily first.
This year Clarrie has taken 17 wickets for Prahran,
while the other bowlers on the side have; collected
14 among them. Gerald Healy, Prahran’s best bat,
has also been strangely neglected. Years ago, be-
fore the district scheme, he won East Melbourne’s
batting average against such elubmates as the late
Frank Laver, the late Sam McMichael, Peter Mc-
Alister and Arthur Christian. With Prahran he has
topped the averages on 10 occasions; two years
ago with 74 and last year with 60, which was
third to Ransford and Woodfull for the whole com-
petition. Moreover, his aggregate (662) was the
highest of the season. Nor can he be accused of
lacking the nerve necessary for a great occasion.
For in the 1921-22 final, against G’ollingwood, his
230 won the match; and again last year, in the
final against North Melbourne, the destination of the
pennant was decided by the 127 that came from his
bat. He is now, perhaps, too old for big games,
though still a busy run-getter, but his exclusion in
the past must be put down to a bad habit that
grew on the select ors.
* * * *
"Cyrano”: On the subject of historic
catches (11. 20/10/ 23), Clem Hill lias a strong claim
for a place among the immortals. In the great
Test at Manchester in 1902, when Australia won by
three runs, Rhodes and Lilley w r ere in, with or! v
eight runs wanted. Lilley hit Trumbie hard and
high to square-leg, apparently well out of reach, but
Clem raced along the boundary and took the ball at
full speed. Then Tate, the last man, came in, hit
a four, and was bowled.
* * * *
“Tren” : A glance over the scores of the
early matches between Victoria and N. S. Wales
shows how rapidly and how far Australian cricket
has evolved. The first game, played at Melbourne
in 1856, was won by N.S.W. by 3 wickets. The top
score was 18, and there were 12 “blobs”—B on the
winning side. Victoria’s 238, in 1858, was the first
three-figure total reached in one innings, and
Tommy Wills’s 49 was the highest individual score
up to that time. These records were broken in 1865,
when Wills made 58 of Victoria’s 285. In 1867
Wardell astonished the cricketing world by making
110 and 45 n.o. for the Vies., but his iperformance
was beaten three years later by the 121 n.o. of
Lieut. Gordon (an English soldier temporarily sta-
tioned at Melbourne). These were the only two
centuries made in these matches in 25 years. It was
not until 1870, when E. Gregory made 64, that 50
runs were scored by a Sydneysider. This was bet-
tered by Charlie Bannerman, who made 81 in ’74
and 83 in ’75. Dave Gregory made 74, his highest score,
in ’76, in the last match played on the- Albert
Ground, Redfern, before it was cut into building allot-
ments. The most successful batsman in that quarter
of a century was Kelly (Vic.), with an average of
23 for 12 innings, but C. Bannerman (N.S.W.),
with an average of 22 for 14 innings, was not far
behind. N. Thompson, who batted for N.S.W. in 39
innings, played far oftener in these matches than any
other cricketer. At bowling Frank Allen (Vie.),
with 49 wickets, averaging 7.22, was just in front
of Evans (N.S.W'.), whose 50 wickets cost 8.14 each;
but Sam Cosstick, with 78 wickets, averaging 9.55,
and Tommy Wills, with 72, costing 10.17 (both
Vies.), were by far the most destructive bowlers in
the period.
THE DOCTOR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Presenting the Prime Minister of Australia for
the honorary degree of LL.D., the Public Orator
at Cambridge said that when Mr. Biv.ce was at
Trinity Hall he was a vigorous oarsman, eminent
in athletics rather than in the pursuit of learning.’'
When lie was at the Hall he jibbed at turning
The leaves of books for academic lore.
Smugs he eschewed. The only branch of learning
That inclination moved him to explore
With zeal and thoroughness was that concerning
The way to fill a thwart and pull an oar.
Scant knowledge from Pierian springs he drew
But still—he got his blue.
’Tis doubtful if he ever wooed the Muses
Or ridges of Parnassus strove to climb.
No subtle casuist he became (like Hughes is) ;
He never waved his arms in Union lime-
Light perorating. But he had his uses,
He pulled his weight and didn’t waste his time
Till, nineteen years ago, he helped, did Bruce,
To cook the Oxford goose.
He never cumbered up his mental attics
With things for which scholastic bays are strewn;
He won no laurels for his mathematics;
He neither dodged nor neared the wooden spoon ;
What smattering he may have of hydrostatics
Was gained between the autumn term and June,
I’ll hazard, not in haunts where students cram
But on the sedgy Oam.
He learned to rdw, maybe with profit greater
Than came to many a man who merely read.
A better training for a legislator
Than all the faculties from A to Z
Who queries it? AVell, not his Alma Mater
Who pats her old alumnus on the head
And sends him home again, in honor’s cause,
Doctor of Civil Laws.

THE INKY WAY.
“A.l’.”: The ex-Victoiian Lady Doughty, who ha;
been living in Paris since last year, has been
writing poems which a young Italian composer,
Pietro Zeppili, has been turning into songs of
strength and melodic fire. Two rather striking-
songs, “The Victors” and “Like Winter’s Night,'’
have already been published.
London will have a chance to buy Jack McLaren’s
“My Odyssey” for a Christmas present: Jonathan
Cape published it early in November. The
book consists mainly of notes of “McNorth's” travels
in Papua, the Islands and northernmost Queensland .
and scores of his Bulletin pars will be worked
into the narrative. After the “Odyssey” the next
book to carry this industrious writer’s name will
be “Songs of a Fuzzytop”— The Bulletin has
been publishing some of these songs lately;
“Herald”: Harold Gaze, who struck out a line for
hiinself in writing stories for children, is doing well
in America. Some of the imaginative kids’ stories,
he wrote while on the Sydney Daily Telegraph
are being printed in book form. Probably not a
publisher in Australia would have touched them, and
probably also if a publisher had made the venture,
he would have suffered for it ; but coming back
with the stamp of wide American acceptance; the book
will most likely- have a big sale in the land of its
origin.
“Gallery”: Moved by the excitement of the time,
40 Anglican clergymen lately resolved in Melbourne
that it was up to the Lawson Government to recon-
sider its decision to sack the police strikers. The
Argus unexpectedly fell upon the enthusiasts, inform-
ing them in caustic tones that their opinions were
of no more account than those of any other 40 citi-
zens, and that, in effect, their ill-considered decision
was an incitement to uproar and disunion when the
Government wanted to present a solid front. It
wouldn’t have mattered if the reproof had come
from any other newspaper, but to be smacked by the
Argus, which every Monday morning prints extracts
from their Sunday sermons, was a terrible blow to
their amour: propre. Two or three of the offenders
immediately broke into print to explain that they-
meant no harm, and were merely expressing a per-
sonal opinion.
“Hamer”: Hector Larnond, ex-M.H.R. and one-time
managing-editor of the Worker, has stepped back
into the Inky Way again, having acquired the business
ot the Berrima Printing Co, which publishes the
Southern Mail, Mittagoiig Express, Moss Vale
Record and Robertson Advocate. When Larnond
was in charge of the Worker he gave the first wages
“log” to the Writers and Artists’ Union (afterwards
merged into the A.J.A.). It provided for largely-
increased rates, and, as a set-off, two of the staff
were put off, wherefore with a howl of “Victimisa-
tion!” the rest (Tom Mutch, M.L.A., was one of
them) went on strike. Then the amusing spectacle
was seen of Old Man Spence, hinrself the leader of
many strikes, accusing the recalcitrant journalists of
holding a pistol at his head. Larnond long angled
for political honors, but failed to hold his Parlia-
mentary seat for long. He went out of the Labor
party over the Conscription issue.
“Worried Sub-Editor”: About the maddest thing
that ever came oyer the wires was that Kipling poem
for Armistice Day. It was despatched from London
by, apparently, a very conscientious clerk of about 15,
with a lordly disregard for his (or her) employers’
money. It gave ail the punctuation, including the
interesting fact that one should put a full stop after
the title and another at the end of the poem. It gave
Rudyard Kipling’s name three times over. It thought-
fully mentioned how many- verses there were, and how
many lines in each- —before giving the poem in full.
It commented on the odd detail that the second line
is the same in every verse—and then gave that line
in full eight times, as it occurred. However, that is
the proprietors’ funeral. The worry at the sub.’s
table was the manner of display, thus: “Stop griev-
ing dash grieving exclamation bracket stop when you
come to London town stop.” Or, working up to a
dignified and moving close: “So do you end quote
exclamation and italics this may- ease the grieving
stop Rudyard Kipling.”
“Machete”: In fairness to John Norton (B.
l/il/’23) mention the fact that in his later days he
mostly turned a baleful eye on strong waters, and
that he had always made persistent efforts to scare
Iris einploy-ees off the primrose paths that run through
hotel bars. In the days before the A.J.A. became
a power, John added to his other eccentricities,
amiable and otherwise, an intense dislike of raising-
salaries. In a fairly- long experience of the tribune
I cannot recall having seen him so overcome as when
two of his Brisbane, staff asked for a rise. They
had not met John before, and they rushed to their
doom, all unheeding of the warnings of old Bill, the
manager, whose experience of Napoleon went back
many- years. “Do you,” bellowed John when he
had recovered his wits- —-“do yon seriously imagine
that 1 am conducting this venal and scurrilous rag as a
. e-e-e-lymosvnary insti-tu-tion ?” As the wretched
pair slunk from the presence, John, who valued a
long- word far above rubies, relented. “Mr. ,” he
yelled to the manager, cowering in his cubicle next
door, “see that these twin -s are paid 10s. a
week more; and send me any others who consider
they have claims on my- good nature.”
“Stroller,”: How meagre are the prizes offered to
writers as compared with those given to artists!
Think of the annual Archibald prize amounting to
Ji4oo for the best portrait painted during the year
and the Travelling Scholarships awarded in Melbourne
and Sydney. The competition for art prizes is open
to all, that for literary prizes is mainly confined to
graduates or undergraduates at a university. There
is the Dublin Prize (founded by Melbourne citizens
who were students at the Dublin University) for the
best Australian volume published during the year;
and the Him dev Prize, awarded annually for the best
volume of verse written by an undergraduate of
Adelaide University. It was first given to Leon
Gellert for his “Songs of a Campaign” in 1917.
Then prizes for essays are offered at the Sydney,
Hobart and Brisbane Universities, the lastnamed
being for p v essay on an Australian subject. The
latest prize, which has been donated to St. Stanislaus’
College by- Mr. R. D. Meagher, is for an essay each yea-
on “Above Ail for Australia.” What is needed is
a literary- prize open to any man or woman in the
Commonwealth. That the winning an open prize
does muen to establish a writer is evident from the
experiences of Stephen Phillips and John Masefield.
It was the £lOO prize given by the Academy for
his “Christ in Hades,” which started the former
on his career; and when Masefield won the £lOO
prize awarded by the Royal Literature Society,
London, the sales of his “Everlasting Mercy-” sprang
2000 copies in four days.
THE GREATEST JOURNALISTIC FORCE.
[FOR THE BULLETI N.]
The Editor with luscious glee
The smudgy, tangled picture views;
He lets my screed go pencil-free,
Exclaiming- “Ah, but this is news!"
Black headlines will that screed emboss,
For with this murder 1 have gathered
A photo which will bear a cross
To mark “Where Thug- his victim splathered."
Vain leaders written to alarm
The public mind my space may vex ;
They have their use, but cannot charm
Like photos duly marked with “x."
A thrill is in the printed tones —
“This shows where Blbodlust used his chopper,'
Or “Where the cross is shown the bones,
All charred, were found beneath the copper.”
Though beauty contests help, divorce
Brings profit where there miglht be loss,
The greatest journalistic force
Is still the smudge that bears its cross.
With this we get the public, pelf
By serving thrills to both the sexes;
And so my paper and myself
Go gladly on and make our x-es.

Asche has revived “Othello” at Sydney
Royal, and the public is his debtor for an
impersonation full of intelligence and feel-
ing, and for a production eminently satisfy-
ing on the spectacular side. To rail at the
man because he employs his talent for
devising stage spectacles to the embellish-
ing of Shakspeare is mere pedantry. What
dramatic author is worthier of such embel-
lishment, what producer more capable of
doing the thing properly? The Bard might
conceivably turn in his grave at Anew
McMaster’s reading of lago, but one can’t
imagine him disputing the proposition that
Asche knows more about scenery, lighting,
costumes, furniture and effects than were
dreamt of in his philosophy. Neither, per-
haps, would he object to the introduction of
brisk Cypriote dancers when Cassius lets
the canakin clink, nor to the sight of a bibu-
lous old soldier pouring wine on the side of
his goblet so that it won’t froth, like Syd-
ney beer. Asche’s Moor is a thought less
Ethiopian than 10 years since, and his voice
has gained in modulation without sacri-
fice of power. Compelling in the Venetian
Council Chamber, he rises to noble heights
of passion and force in the last tremendous
scene. Arthur Greenaway is a good Cassius
—very good when the enemy he has put in
his mouth has stolen away his brains —and
the spirited Emilia of Jessie Page will be
remembered when the colorless Desdemona
of Diana Wilson is forgotten. Also, Eardley
Turner is a dignified Duke of Venice, and
the feelings of a father who has been robbed
of his only daughter by a gentleman of
color are ably simulated by George F. Ide.
But Roderigo is caricatured by Mason
Wood, and McMaster’s lago is impossible.
Shakspeare’s lago won the confidence of
characters so diverse as Othello, Cassius,
Roderigo, Emilia and Desdemona. The
ranting and grimacing lago that McMaster
presents wouldn’t have won the confidence
of a caterpillar.

There’s much to please at Her Majesty’s,
where comic opera’s played, with Gladys
Moncrieff as attraction chief, in the role of

that’s brewed with craft, a beaker filled with
juices from the warm, warm South for the
thirsty mouth, that Oscar Asche produces.
At Sydney Cri. Sir Joseph Lacy, in the
person of Lawrence Grossmith, continues to
bdeome entangled in the web of malicious
gossip by his indiscretion, and to extricate
himself by his tact and adroitness.
“HARNESSING A HORSE.” AT
SYDNEY TIVOLI.
Will Evans and the fractious panto, horse
that he has been attempting to harness
twice daily for years.
“The O'Brien Girl” is still warbling and
pirouetting melodiously and merrily at Syd-
ney Opera House amid nightly demonstra-
tions of critical approval.
Scoffers at jazz who were dragged to the
Sydney Tivoli last Saturday to hear the
New York Havana Band (it is said to have
taken Edward P.’s fancy) discovered that
there is some good in everything. The visi-
tors, who are to go on to the Ambassadors,
Stewart Dawson’s new and gorgeous restau-
rant, have cut out kerosene-tin banging
stunts and substituted a subdued method of
dealing out syncopated melody. Trombones
and trumpets are muted, and the “percus-
sion” man is as gentle as an applicant for
a position in the Heavenly Choir. The
chief soloists are the banjoists and the saxo-
phonist, the last-named being the conductor,
who keeps time by the swaying of his body.
The ensemble playing is really worth hear-
ing. Will Evans is “Losing an Umberella,”
and he misplaces his gamp much better than
he harnesses a horse. Rebe Kesslova, a
local miss with a violin, who has been abroad
for some time, is greatly improved, and in
an artistic gipsy setting uses her bow with
a fine skill.
Charles Jones scrambles through “Hell’s
Hole” at Hoyt’s (Sydney) shaky and badly
singed and with just enough strength left to
support a damsel’s head upon his breast at
the fade-out. “Sure-Fire Flint” speeds
through a ghastly procession of heart-stop-
ping situations at the Lyceum to release a
sweet thing locked up in an iron safe. In
addition Alice Calhoun is seeking an “in-
tended” without any previous experience, the
fellow nominated by her family not coming
up to expectations. “Prehistoric Hayseeds,”
Keaumont Smith’s latest, on view at the
Globe, is fair enough in its way; but people
are rather sick of the eternal harping upon
“DE LUXE ANNIE,” AT MELBOURNE
HER MAJESTY’S.
Cyrus Monroe (Maurice Dudley) vamps De
Luxe Annie (Emelic Polini), whilst
the latter contemplates blackmail.
the alleged stupidity of the country cousin.
The Strand introduces Agnes Ayres, “The
Heart Raider,” who pursues a financial and
good-looking misogynist with a view to matri-
mony. On the same bill “The Forgotten
Law” is out-and-out sob stuff. The Rialto
has “Australia Calls,” a Government magnet
film calculated to draw pale clerks from
Clapliam Junction; and the wheels of “A
Covered Waggon” still revolve at the Crystal
Palace.
* * *
“Madame Angot” was made an interesting
revival by the Vic. Opera Co. at the Melbourne
Playhouse despite all its faults and short-
comings. There are many good voices in
the co., and among the few who can act
as capably as they sing veteran George
Tutton, as Pomponnet, was conspicuous.
Tutton, in the second act, made a feature
of the charming song which has usually been
omitted from professional productions of the
opera, because a low-comedian Pomponnet
is not, as a rule, enough of a vocalist for
the job. Miss Ida Ashton, as Clairette, was
only a little more pleasing than Miss Ivy
Sears in the more difficult part of Mdlle.
Lange; Romola Hanstein sang the famous
Angot song with some vim; and Stanley
Coverdale bore himself pretty well as Lari-
vaudiere, the baritone. As for the principal
tenor —well, he is a painful subject, like
the worst of the furnishings, noticeably
Lange’s dressing-table.
“Second Mrs. Tanqueray,” the miscalled
“problem play” of 30 years agone, will fill
the bill at Melbourne King’s for two weeks
after this, and bring a remarkably fruitful
season to an end. Everybody by this time
should have noticed that Pinero’s shapely
play raises no problem. Firstly, brethren,
it is a warning to widowers with wowsery
daughters and other puritanical belongings—
a warning, indeed, to any widower with any
sort of family. Secondly, the play proves
the unwisdom of any man, old or young,
who picks a neurotic woman of the world
for liis bride. He ought to have a trust-
worthy medical certificate of mental health
•with his lady. The performance at the
King’s runs more easily now than on the
first night, but the Paula of Miss Vanbrugh
has lost little of her unlovableness. The
artist acts up to a clear conception of the
character. She presents Paula as an Un-
mistakable demi-mondaine of the intellectual
type, and in so doing she makes it hard to
account for the infatuation of Aubrey Tan-
queray (notwithstanding Ills previous painful
experience of rigid virtue in matrimony), or
of Peter Jarman, _ who had made her
mistress of his yachting party in a Mediter-
ranean cruise. Jarman, it is true, may have
been a thick-skinned fellow' vdio liked his
inamorata to be a crisp apple rather than a
peach. But how about the author’s depic-
tion of Tanqueray, or even young Ardaile?
Admitting that Ardaile had no depth of
character —Paula says he will soon recover
from the loss of Ellean —he must have been
a sentimental self-deceiver when Paula knew
him, or how could he have accepted Paula
as an angel? And if he didn't bring any
tender sentiment into the entanglement,
what sort of adventuress was Paula to have
“kept house” with him? Irene Vanbrugh’s
conception of Paula tends to throw the play
out of gear, yet cannot rob it of its greatest
charm. It is free from all the modern in-
ventions of American drama. No part of its
plot is transacted by telephone.
“Sally” makes her 100th appearance at
Melbourne Royal next Monday, and every
she w'ho gets there will receive a photo-
graphic souvenir of the occasion.
At Melbourne Majesty’s the story of “Do
Luxe Annie,” and her bone on the brain, will
be replaced on Saturday by “The Eyes of
Youth,” one of the numerous blood relations
of tne drama in which Emelie Polini now
utters some of her lines as though she had
lost her old affection for them.
“Tons of Money,” at Melbourne Palace, is
still a great title for a complex farcical
comedy. The public quotes it expressively.
It lingers lovingly on the tongue. You can
imagine anyone saying “Keep away from
Macbeth if you want a good laugh,” but you
can havdly think of a person saying “Tons
of Mo. ey is no good.”

The gentle flow of Doone at Melbourne
Princess’s carried the season as far as “Tom
Moore” last Saturday. Until Friday night
this week a weird ill-fitting tall hat, which
looks like a caricature of 18th-century
fashion, will call attention to the fact that
Allen Doone’s head was not to the tail-hat
manner born. Also the plot of the costume
melodrama, turning, as it does, on the
alleged youth and beauty of one Bessie Dyke,
wdio keeps an amazing school for ragged
kiddies, will continue to bump heavily
against the solemn truth that Miss Edna
Keeley w 7 as more slim and youthful in years
of old. “Tom Moore” being the drama
wherein Andrew Mack opened his Australian
venture long ago, comparisons between the
Andrew and Allen productions would be
cruel, not to say heartless. The present
show is satisfactory, all things _ considered,
matters for consideration being rather
numerous. Doone himself is satisfactory to
those who are charmed by his one and only
manner; Ronald Riley is a very capable ex-
ponent of calm, collected wickedness that
specialises in the leading of rustic beauty
astray; Charles Brown is a satisfactory
Robin Dyke; others, from Lord Moira down-
wards in the social scale, are_ not amiss.
Even the landlady who bursts into emotion
when poet Tom composes the words and
music of “Oh, the Days Are Gone” is not
an exception to the rule. Bellairs, as the
Prince Regent, perhaps cannot help being
strikingly unlike pictures of the late Beau
Brummel’s fat friend, but he might at least
refrain from active violence of manner. He
shakes this paper’s faith in the majesty
whicl doth hedge a king. Doone’s next
effort i ‘ Tfii Burglar and the Lady.”
Long Tack Sam and his Dana cf Chinese
workers are a comprehensible attracdor to
Melbourne Tivoli. The turn is ornamental
and vivacious, and certain of the troupe’s
acrobatic contortions on the horizontal bar
look Asiatic in their unusualness. Also
Ethel Newman’s sketch is brief and bright,
and two musical ladies with piano accom-
paniment can be commended. But a pro-
portion of cast-iron self-confidence and
audacious bluff in the rest of the entertain-
ment sets one questioning the average intel-
ligence of modern audiences. Performers
do protest too much about themselves. One
lady talks all the time about her personal
bulk, and does little else than behave like
what is vaguely classed as “a trick.” Mem-
bers of the orchestra are dragged into dis-
cussions, and in one instance a stage conver-
sation is carried down into the stalls without
making any pretence of wit or humor.
“The Heart Raider” is being greeted
warmly at Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week.
Agnes Ayres is a buccaneer on the V amp-
ish Main, and by dashing work lands a big
prize in the final chapter. Another

“THE SECOND MRS. TANQUERAY."
AT MELBOURNE KING'S.
Paula (Irene Vanbrugh) offers Aubrey Tan
queray (C. H. Mallard) the letter eon-
taining details of her iurid past on t'y
eve if their marriage
adventure in the stereotyped, showing how a
meek man becomes a hero once more. Five
reels of Irish sentimentality on the same
programme are labelled “The Man with Two
Mothers.” “The Dingo,” an Australian-
made tragedy of conventional cut, is the
week's feature at the Melba. “Westbound
Limited,” at the Britannia, would probably
be described by a railway signaller as an
epic.

Another look at the Art Association’s
show at Melbourne Athenaeum: —
Blamire Young remains entrenched in the
style that has made him celebrated, as
his curiously attractive “Glamor of the Bush’'
bears witness. W. D. Know is not his
usual romantic self in “In the Twilight,” nor are
Septimus Power’s two efforts entitled to applause.
Will Ashton’s Harbor pieces seem to have been
produced according to a familiar recipe, whilst,
according to “Spring in the Valley,” A, E. New-
bury’s art is leading a double life. C. Hampel's
flower studies are good, but Dora Wilson’s stodgy
“Sans Souei” leaves one unmoved, and the once
engaging MacNally seems now to be a sort of pictorial
Houdini straining to escape from a mode that
holds him captive. Napier Waller’s designs for
mural decorations occupy a good portion of one
wall, and he is responsible for several charming
wccdcuts, which rub shoulders with some capital
drawings and a lithograph cf C. J. Dennis by Jas.
Macdonald. Thea Proctor’s distinctive water-color,
“Fal'als,” a couple of Sydney Ure Smith’s etchings,
and Web Gilbert’s bronzes of Hugh MeCrae and the
late Alexander Steven also deserve a vote of thanks.

Hilda Greene, a young English soprano,
whose London College of Music and Guild-
hall training has been reinforced by some
good local teaching, made a promising first
appearance the other night at Melbourne
Queen’s Hall. She has a sweet, richly-
modelled voice, phrases well, and shows a
nice appreciation of vowel sounds. Ger-
trude Alger, whose violin has been muted for
sonn years added musical weight to the
programm.
In Adelaide the Majestic is the only the-
atre left going—it has a variety bill, especi-
ally strong on the musical side. But in
the open there are, at the. Exhibition, a
Williamson co., run by Elton Black and
Billy Maloney; and at Austral Gardens a
similar “Flashes” team, with Moon and
Morris, also Frank Bradley, who did good
work in Adelaide as an amateur actor long
ago. The Boyal has settled down content-
edly to pictures, with the big “Covered
Wagon.” The York has a similar theme.
“Pioneer Trails.” The Pav. with Harold
Lloyd and West’s with Charles Chaplin are
both riotously funny. “The Pilgrim” may
not be a great play; but this critic has sel-
dom heard more continuous laughter than
in the scene where Chaplin converts a black
bowler hat into a pudding.

“The Oldest”: The death of Alfred Clint,
at SI, recalls the production of “Antony and
Cleopatra” by Walter Montgomery ar tne
Old Royal, Melbourne, in July, 1867. John
Hennings did the scenery, and Clint was his
assistant—his first job in Australia. Mont-
gomery was Antony; Miss Cleveland (Mrs.
Charles Vincent), Cleopatra; Charles Vin-
cent, Octavius; J. C. Lambert, Lepidus;
Richard Stewart (Nellie’s father), the
Clown; and Harwood, Enobarbus. Docy
TAKING A GENERAL VIEW, HE DID.
THE VISITOR : “My wife was a model —did you know
her?”
THE ARTIST: “Oh, bately."
Stewart (Nellie’s eldest sister) was also in
the cast, and the Octavia was Mane St.
Denis, a young and fascinating actress whom
unrequited love drove to suicide in October,
1868.
Norman Campbell’s endorsement: —
I rise to give “Stabbard Light” three cheers for
his remarks on “The Hairy Ape” and its shandy-gaff
critics. The S. M. Herald waved an indignant brolly
at the play, and told in pained accents how the
audience was “disgusted.” Then she let “Pro Bono
Publico” (none other!) babble of “revolting bias-
phemy.” I, in common, I think, with the rest of the large
audience, heard no blasphemy, and was not revolted.
I had no other emotion than appreciation for the
producer’s heroic effort to give Australia a taste of
the real thing—Australia, which has been surfeited
with sex dramas and lingerie comedies that only
succeed by skating dexterously over the thin ice
which covers filth. We accept the improper adjec-
tive when it has the seal of Bernard Shaw. We
swallow without a grimace the outspokenness of “The
Beggar’s Opera” because it is tricked out in wigs
and laces. But “The Hairy Ape,” which rings true
in every line, must be howled down because the
vitality of it shocks our mealy-mouthed critics, and
the poetry of it they miss. An anonymous detractor
like “Pro Bono” unconsciously stresses the Hairy
Ape’s sermon, which may be epitomised by the
Spanish proverb, “He who washes an ass’s head
wastes his soap.”
A Paula of the past:—
Of the Melbourne people now crowding to see
“Tanqueray” at the King’s, how many can remember
Geraldine Olitfe’s beautiful and touching Paula, at
the Princess’s, in 1895? Geraldine, who was in
Melbourne for less than three months during Mrs.
Brough’s holiday trip to London, was a quick study,
and an equally quick forgetter of the lines. The
interval between her first three appearances in the
part and her subsequent final performance sufficed
to put her to the trouble of learning the words
again, with the result that her second reading had
pointy of difference from the first. A most interest-
ing artist was this fleeting visitor. Starting in
Melbourne in “An Ideal Husband” in June, before
appearing in H. A. Jones’s “The Masqueraders,
she said good-bye in August. Because of her artistic
success in the experimental previous season of three
nights, “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” was staged
again for her farewell effort, Grace Noble (E lean)
and Miss Talbot (Mrs. Cortelyon) also making final
appearances. All three were booked for London.
“E.T.”: I wish somebody would decide
what is and what is not a Repertory play.
“Stabbard Lyte” (B. 22/11/’23) appears
to be certain in his own mind that “The
Hairy Ape”, is in that category, and I hope
it is. But when he contemptuously refers
to the productions of the Sydney Repertory
Society as “amemic” and “popular successes
(or failures) that are not Repertory shpws
at all,” I wonder whether he really knows.
The list of Sydney Rep. performances in-
cludes six of Bernard Shaw’s pieces, three
by Galsworthy, one each by Granville Barker-,
Ibsen, Gilbert Chesterton, Clemence _Dane
and J. M. Barrie; also two pieces by Eliza-
beth Baker and three of local authorship.
Surely a record of which any Repertory
theatre in the world might be proud!
“Banshee”: Sybil Arundale has the part
of a lady bookie in a Eondon Lyceum thriller,
“What Money Can Buy.” Sybil has to con-
ceal a generous heart beneath a raucous
check suit and grey topper, and her kindness
to the down-and-out is supposed to expiate
her dreadful calling. She is described as a
cheerful fielderess who does her share in
spoiling the dirty work of the principal mis-
creant, and is specially remembered for her
loyalty to a parson who seems to be a scoff
in the mouths of the wicked. The well-pre-
served Sybil has had 32 years on the stage.
She began at the Assembly Rooms in the
drowsy village of Worthing in a piece called
“Claimants,” staged by old Hermann Vezin.
“p.L.L.” : An incident as
harassing as that described by
“The Deacon” (B. 11/10/’23)
occurred at a Sydney vaudeville
house a few years ago. The
lady was giving a more or l(?ss
graceful imitation of a “white
swan” when some of the swans-
down began to obey the law of
gravitation. My best girl (we
were sitting in the orchestra
stalls) became intensely in-
terested in the interior of the
box of chocolates. Earnest re-
quests to “Pull ’em .up” came
from the back seats; but the
White Swan took no notice.
Ultimately the “dinkum chat”
came from the wings, and she
vanished with the speed of a
Sheffield sprinter who has
beaten the starter’s gun.
“Thersites”: The property-
men at Her Majesty’s, Sydney,
regard the refreshments pro-
vided for the mummers in “A
Southern Maid” as a horrible
waste of good liquor and en-
ables. “Blime!” said one old
hand the other day, “cold tea
or burnt sugar was good enough
for all the actors ever I've
’andled. Yet this ’ere mob
guzzles eight dozen of wine—o 6
bottles, mind yer—every blessed
week, besides moppin’ up four
gallons of ice-cream. Pamperin’ ’em, I calls
it. The perfeshun’s gorn to the dorgs!”
“Second Murderer”: A Sydney newspaper
announced that “three first nights” had
simultaneously occurred in Melbourne —
Boucicault and his wife in “The Second Mrs.
Tanqueray,” Emelie Polini in “De Luxe
Annie,” and Allen Doone in “Sweet County
Kerry.” Boucicault first played Cayley
Drummle in Melbourne more than 25 years
ago, Emelie Polini has been first-nighting in
“De Luxe Annie” during the past five or
six years, and Allen Doone opened his long
Australian innings in “Sweet County Kerry”
in Melbourne as far back as 1909. Doone’s
“pretty play” wasn’t just off the ice even
then, for W. H. Leake staged it in Mel-
bourne in 1880 —43 years ago—with H. E.
Walton in Doone’s part. I played in the
piece myself with the late Wilson Forbes
in ’9B.
“F.A.”: A mummer who frowned on the
practice of taking the curtain between acts
(B. 15/11/’23) was the late Cuyler Hast-
ings. His sole lapse occurred after his con-
cluding performance in Australia, and then
he rebuked the audience for expecting an
actor to step across a gulf of a thousand
years in a few moments.
A PROFESSIONAL INFERENCE.
“My hoy, since I saw you last Eve been carrying everything be-
fore me.”
“Ah, well, I once had to take on a waiter's job myself.”
“Muljarra”: Harry Muller, who succeeds
the younger Hugh Ward as manager of
Sydney Opera House, is known in theatri-
cal circles from Perth to Brisbane and right
through Maoriland. Once a solicitor’s office-
boy in Palmerston North (MX.), he tired
of handing “blisters” from importunate credi-
tors to debtors desirous of forgetting the past,
and became a billsticker. Then he went with
the Fullers, and when Ben and John joined
hands with Hugh J. in bringing Hugh J.
Ward Theatres, Ltd., into being, he became
the firm’s Victorian manager. Harry is a
cousin of May Beatty, and was Willie Den-
ver to her Cissy when “The Silver King”
was first let loose in M.L. But that was
one of his very few offences on the stage.
“Rolls Royce”: Sims Reeves sang the part
of Maeheath in a Covent Garden revival of
“The Beggar’s Opera” 70 years ago. The
Tolly Peachum of that show was Mrs. Haigh
Dyer, an aunt of Mrs. Gustave Slapoffski.
Mrs. Dyer was the original Gipsy Queen in
the first performance of “The Bohemian
Girl” at Drury-lane, Balfe wielding the baton.
Slapoffski, who has been shaking his stick at
the orchestra of “The Beggar’s Opera” in
Melbourne, directed the musical proceedings
at the jubilee performance of “The Bohemian
Girl” in London.
“Adelaide”: An unusual kind of Austra-
lian show is that built up by Dr. Herbert
Basedow, the S.A. authority on Biughi. It
consists of moving-pictures of a journey from
Sydney to Brisbane, Thursday Island and
Darwin, thence south into the interior, with
a host of illustrations of native life and an
accompanying lecture. The thing is going
well in S.A. scientific circles, and should
have sufficient general interest to make it
a commercial proposition. Basedow is a
South Australian who, after graduation, took
to the roving life of a geologist, and has of
recent years specialised in oil-hunts.
“Renquillian”: Charlie Fanning, a
black-face farce, “Wanted an Actor,” ’was
30 years ahead of the actor-r ' Csesai s
Ghost” mentions (B. 15/11/’33). Asked
what salary he wanted Charlie debonairly
mentioned £lOOO a week. "That’s all right,
replied the manager, “What 11 you take.
“Oh, a cuppler quid a week, said Charlie.
“Spangles”: I have never had any con-
lidence in hypnotic shows since an experi-
ence I had with Joe. Joe had been put into
a seven years’ (perhaps it was seven days )
trance and sealed up in a glass case. Out-
side the hall in which the wizardry had been
worked I met a
cobber with beer.
“Joe worded me to
fetch it,” he ex-
plained. Another
cobber let us in by
the stage-door. At
mention of beer Joe
got out, and with-
out breaking the
seal either. I’ll
always remember
Joe; he kept us
talking till the beer
was gone, then
crept into the case
and resumed his
seven years’ slum-
ber —perhaps it
was seven days.
“Fax” : Wh a t
has happened to
Somerset Maugham
to make him such
a caustic satirist
of attractive
women? Now that
women’s verdict
has the financial
making or break-
in g of plays,
M augham can
hardly expect to
grow rich on
“slinging-off” at the
sex. In his recent
“Our Betters” he
presents three
American women
who have married
British titles and
taken to disrespect-
ability for pastime.
One of them calls
another a “damned
fool” for having
“risked it” when
she was likely to
be found out. In
“Home an d
Beauty.” a bitterly
satirical Maugham
comedy which the
“Man from Toron-
to” co. played in
Sydney under an-
other 'title, the
heroine was a
selfish matron billed
as a “dear little
thin g,” with a
mother who had
moulded her daughter's unlovely character.
Hut the plot of that unpopular play was not
blue. In “Our Betters" the plot is blue as
a tropical sky. „ r , v
“Wilfrido” : Is the quality of London audi-
ences, not to say of London morals, indicated
by the surfeit of ladies of informal conven-
tions at present on the stage? lasmin, the
outstanding female character in Meekers
beautiful “Hassan,” is a harlot, while 1
“Ambush,” another play which is attractin ß
a deal of attention, the tyranny of circum-
stances reduces the father to depend on the
attractions of his daughter. In Our Bet-
ters” Somerset Maugham has given Banj
George Craystone an insufferable lover, ana
her sister, the Duchess, an effeminate fancy
man.” whom she looks after for the usua
consideration. Not that this matters much,
until Lady George is indiscreet enough to
compromise herself with her sister s pro-
perty.” ...
“Abbot Park”: To drag players in front
of the curtain at the end of the acts ot a
drama or comedy is inartistic, enough; out
worse surely is the idiotic habit of applaud-
ing the first entry of each character. At
Melbourne King’s on the first showing of
“The Second Mrs. Tanqueray” everyone in
the piece received this kind of recognition,
down to the mummer who portrayed a ser-
vant. You couldn’t get better evidence that
the people don’t attempt to judge the merits
of a play as a play.
“J.H.” (London) : Australians doing well
on the halls include Malcolm McEacliern
and the Chisholm girls, now established favo-
rites at the Alhambra. Malcolm is helping
to arrange Henry Wood’s projected tour of
S’Africa and Australia; the money, lie tells
me, is in hand. Another Aussie holding Ins
end up after a pretty rough time is Sydney
tenor Harold Williams. Harold, who used
to play a pretty good game of Rugby tor
Eastern Suburbs, is singing for the big
Columbia Gramophone Co.
THE VOICES OF THE DAWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Adown our street, although ’tis grey,
Cold concrete, not a flowery way,
And hides no dryad’s lair,
The ancient spirit is not dead,
For when Aurora blushes red
There’s music everywhere.
Though we have neither bard nor bird
To hymn her rise, the air is stirred-
Yea, hammered, rent and sawn —
By faithful clocks that joyous sing
Their shrill, insistent “Ting-ling-ling !’’ —
True heralds of the dawn.
With thundering hoofs and clashing wheels,
As though a devil at his heels
Were reaching for his lug,
The wildly-yowling milkman comes
To leave the imprint of his thumbs
Inside the waiting jug.
Doors bang, gates rattle, babies wail,
The neighbors 5 mongrels bark the scale
Right down from “Yip!” to “Woof!”
And shriller than the cricket sings
The newsboy whistles as he flings
The paper on the roof.
Some tram-man, where the line is barred,
Dinges the welkin good and hard,
The shrill steam-whistles toot;
And as a lost soul in the throes
Of wild remorse might blow its nose,
Asthmatic sirens hoot.
Ah, no! no larks spring from our street
With lyric melody to greet
Aurora rising fair ;
But when the morn with sandals bright
Sheds glory from the eastern height
We have a jazz band there.

What of the Harvest ?
Farmers of Australia ! As you view the ripened grain
waving in the breeze resolve to get the full benefits of
the harvest. Think of your labour in plowing and
sowing, cultivating and fertilising ; how you have
watched and tended your growing crops, how you
have hoped and feared as Nature did her part.
And now that reaping time has come reap a full
harvest as your just reward.
Conned the CASE Trador with
harvest operations
Time is the very essence of your harvesting contract, for the weather is proverbially
fickle. One of the advantages of the CASE Tractor is that it will enable you to har-
vest quickly. This one-man outfit will lighten your labours—it will decrease the
cost of harvesting—it will do the work of ten or twelve horses and keep on doing it
until the job is done—it never tires.
All the power you need for every harvest operation—reaping, threshing, hauling-
power for every need on the farm—is at your command in this mechanical aid.
Say good-bye to out-of-date methods—let a CASE Tractor help you to prosperity.
CASE Tractors are made by a firm which has been specialising

Paying 365 Dividends a year
Is the famous Bissell Sweeper. There
is a decided difference in carpet sweep-
ers and only Bissell has the famous
"*Cyco” Ball Bearings which always
brings the brush in correct contact
with rug or carpet, giving longer
wear, more thorough sweeping,
smoother operation.
Even where there is an electric cleaner
tor cleaning, the modern home still
demands Bissell’s sweeper for sweep-
ing. The Bissell makes a Christmas
gift of genuine utility, spread over
every day in the year, lasting usually
ten years or more.

Insects are
Unpleasant
Company—
they are not particular
whether they tease the
cat, torment the baby, or
bite father.
Insects are not fussy about their
habits or their place of abode.
They revel in filth, and, for the
good of mankind, such dissemi-
nators of disease should be
mercilessly destroyed; and the
easiest and surest way is by the
use of
Kruses
insecticide
The beauty about this remarkable
destructor of noxious insects is
that it is quite harmless to poultry
and domestic pets, but with Fleas,
Flies, Ants, Bugs, Cockroaches,
Mosquitoes, Moths, etc., one puff
means sudden death.
One tin of the genuine Kruse’s
Insecticide, intelligently used, will
keep a house free from Insects
for months. It is the most
economical and effective exter-
minator of insect pests obtainable.
Insist on getting the original and
genuine Kruse's It never fails.

Malicia 1).: Much obliged. The thief is
being- pursued... .N.W.P. : Too local; this paper nas
to interest a whole continent. ... Karamu: Verse
evidently intended tor wombats. They might hnd
a meaning by burrowing-... .Abbas: But you can't
assume that the U.S. production of cotton will go
on diminishing. Certainly boll-weevil has been
spoiling more and more of the crop: but there is
an enormous anti-weevil campaign in progress, and
it is alleged that the electrolytic production of
calcium arsenate has been perfected, and that the
fly may thereby be reduced to a negligible factor.
He has been doing in the U.S. A. alone about
£80,000,000 of damage annually 'Rise L.: Has
neither feeling nor skill 1V.K.B.: It started with
the makings of a good yarn, but you let it slither
away... .The Wanderer: Too thin to stand up....
V.B.: It doesn’t exactly clamor for print... .J.O.M.:
A number .of unlikely happenings without much
point... .Tempe: Not quite enough there, but not
badly done. ... Stephen B.: If you kept to real
observation and wrote in English you might make it
humorous . .. .O.A.J.: No use. The second thing
hasn’t any resemblance to blank verse... .J.E.G.:
Album verse of the lower suburban grade.... E. I’, it.:
No interest at all....G.M. (Edgecliif) : Little skill
and less feeling. .. .Jack W.: The Verse doesn’t quite
do what you mean it to....C.S. (Kogarah) : Not
nearly. .. . T.A.C.: They miss by a mile. .. .Richard
M.: Too weak and poorly expressed. ... Ripponlea:
The fooling is too obvious... .G.WAV.: A long way
off... . Bellerive: An excellent statement of the case:
In the heart of the city
Wild scenes did occur,
Pell-mell frantic people
Did rush here and there ;
Shop windows were smashed,
Goods plundered and wrecked,
And many were injured
Before the violence was checked,
Bottles and missiles were
Hurled in the riot ;
Not till near dawn did
The town become quiet.
The real police of Melbourne,
In sunshine and rain,
Did their duty like men
And will be wanted again.
. . . .Q.M.: Come down to earth. . . .Farthingale: You
set. off after a tiger and knock off every few minutes
to g'o in pursuit of a rabbit. Stick to your argu-
ment.... Mornbak: Its tragic intensity gets it a
hearing:—-
Around the room it buzzes,
Full of maggots and of germs,
While the ole man swears and cusses,
Yelling peace at any terms.
It hops on the Irish stew,
Leaving its little load,
Consisting of a few
That wriggle on the road.
At last it sees something so nice
He thinks that he will suck it,
But soon finds out it will suffice
To make liifn kick the bucket.
.. ..G.L.G.: You’ve left too many of the marks of
your literary workshop on it....Tom Hah: An old
idea and made very tedious.... W.D.M.: Poor yarn.
T. Vern: Verse must have more in it than that.
....Vagrant: The incident is too slight.... F.L.S. :
That idea generally suggests itself first; and then
that lame cantering metre is selected. At least one
sample reaches the office every week.... Vince K.:
Too much melodrama.... Logan C.: Ungrammatical
parody.... Fred A.: Too obvious.... The Wanderer :
Even with the freedom of rhymeless verse you don’t
get a pulse into it....Sun Shun Quong: We try .to
return even the rubbish when stamps are enclosed.
All we use is paid for.... Coreen N.: Keep at the
washin’ up ; it’s probably better than the verse....
Terence G.: Your “timbrel’s blast of victory” is
a string of commonplaces... .Cobba-C'obba: Not
enough in the snake incident.... Stell: “Ice” doesn’t.
tickle us R.H.C.: Not a bad • attempt; but the
identity of the burglar is clear from the first....
R.L. (Lindfield) : It doesn’t make much of a yarn....
R.S. (Croydon): Far too crude. .. .Michael F.: We
don’t care for it.... Megan S.: Not for us Ch.C.:
“Remorse” misses, but. it wasn’t a bad shot.. ..S.S.
(Bathurst): No use.... Don. C.: Too rugged for the
thin thought... .-J.G.P.W.: The- easiest verse-form in
the world, yet it goes all wrong in scansion.. . .
B.C.F.: The repeated word weakens the line....
F. (Inglewood) : Not bad in its way, but too
thin K.A.J.: Wild, improbable and gory....
Flaneur: Not clever enough for its nastiness....
E.M.C.: If it is fiction it is poor; if true, it wants
a few details as to source.... Ewol H.: Perfectly
correct verse, which says nothing that has not been
said many times before.... Selentes: Handed to the
artist, and he’s still blushing. ... Eltee: Another man
has done it better, .. .Burr: You are fined elevenpence
for loitering. .. .L.E.L.: Much obliged. But wouldn’t
it look a good deal like helping ourselves to the
jam ? Diapason: You misunderstood him. He
questioned whether the youngsters should be on the
streets at all... . Eskay: We went to the cupboard
to see if out of hope we had run ; but when we got
there the apparatus was bare, and so your poor dog-
gerel has none.... F.B.U.: Don’t do it again....
Sidney: It trembled in the balance. If the main
idea had been brand-new there would have been no
doubt about it... . O.C.T.: The background of the
factory is well handled ; but you tell your story in
gasps.... D.F.L. : “At the Door” is well enough
written; but it is a bit long for its Bulletin inter-
est. . . .P.H.C.: Many things in it that The B. has
said a hundred times ; but if Chiozza Money said that
when a bank makes an advance it sets the amount
down as a deposit, he talked nonsense.

Have you
read this new
and very
much talked
of book?
J
Eleanor Gray
tells you
how
to always look
your best
“Y "Y T AS there ever a woman in the
Y/\/ world who couldn’t recall some-
r * time, somewhere, a sombre hour
spent alone in front of her mirror wishing
she were different.”
So begins this intimate interesting book
that cleverly deals with every woman’s
problem of making the very most of her
natural attractiveness.
A Practical Style Atithority
Miss Gray is a practical style authority;
she has studied the problems of thousands
of women. She knows and understands the
different types and just how each type
should express personality and beauty in
clothes. Her new book ‘‘You” gives ad-
vice and suggestions how to attain that
lovely picture every real womait wants to
make of herself —and do it without in
any way increasing the money you now
spend for dress.
Miss Gray discusses the important subject
of proportions in her new book and shows
the necessity of wearing a corset especially
proportioned to your figure needs. She
advises a Gossard Corset because Gossards
are the only corsets designed unerringly
for different figure types. Their front-
lacing comfort, their light scientific bon-
ing, their graceful, natural lines are worth
more to the woman who really cares about
her health and appearance than can be
put into shillings and pence. And yet they
are among the most reasonably priced
articles of clothing to be had today. Do
you realize you can buy a genuine, trade-
marked Gossard Corset for as little cost
as the ordinary corset?
Gossard Brassieres
And Miss Gray recommends your particular
attention to the new Gossard Longerlyne
Brassieres. They are differently designed
for those many women who need special
support at the diaphragm as well as added
length to their brassieres to prevent them
slipping up over the lower tops of the
modern corsets.
Go to the Best Store You Know
You can buy Gossard Corsets and Bras-
sieres at good stores everywhere. The
best store you know is sure to sell them
and render you a fitting service that will
assure you satisfaction.
Use the Coupon Below
While it is on your mind, send for your
copy of “You”. Use the coupon; and
remember that you can depend upon Miss
Gray’s personal advice to help you look
your best. If you have the slightest diffi-
culty in finding the exactly-right Gossard,
Miss Gray will be glad to see that you are
supplied with the model you should have.

“Nugget”: Booksellers have methods of
their own of dealing with the problem of
the bad-seller. Recently I tried to obtain
a copy of the new “Manual of Infantry
Training,” and found it could not be pur-
chased unless the buyer also took a copy
of “Training for War Defence”—the latter
work quite useless to anyone but a trained
soldier on active service. The firms were
apparently not aware of this when they
landed stocks; now they are seeking to make
trainees seeking promotion pay for the
blunder.
* * * *
“Machete”: Recent statements by Austra-
lian wine-experts to the effect that our vine-
yards have nothing to fear from South Afri-
can competition in the English wine trade
are not borne out by the list of awards at
the London Brewers’ Exhibition. Cape grow-
ers took ten firsts, six seconds and six thirds;
Australia, five firsts, seven seconds and two
thirds. Few people in Australia realise how
good the Constantia wines are, and how
much more cheaply than ours they can be
turned out, with plenty of colored labor
available.
“Booyong”: The West Australian jam-
wood can hold its own with any timber in
Australia for, durability in the ground (B.
l/U/”2o). I’ve seen jam-wood posts taken
out of the old fences around York and
Northam that had been doing their job for
over 70 years; and excepting that the thin
layer of sapwood had gone, they were as
sound as they were on the day they .were put in.
Jam-wood does not attain any size, and these
old posts were not split ones, but just sap-
lings eight or ten inches in diameter. What
other timber in Australia used under similar
conditions can equal this?
* * * *
“Sol. M.”: Latest agricultural figures are
cheering—in moderation. Among 35 wheat-
growing countries Australia was 22nd for
yield per acre. It was 23rd for fertility in
oats among 29. For barley it was not quite
so far down among the barrens—l7th among
34. For maize its position was almost re-
spectable—9tli among 24. Maize fetches
much the same price as wheat, and the yield
acre .here is about twice as large; yet
the stuff is imported to some extent, and the
™ under crop was less in 1922 than in
ldl f; . I* would be refreshing if Australia
could take an agricultural first prize some-
where.
Pantagruel : Some hope of relief from
the devastating “bunchy top” is held out to
the hapless banana-growers on the Tweed
River (Q.) by a new variety of the fruit. This
has been cultivated by a Queenslander, W.
A. Sands, of Nambour, who imported it
seven years ago ifrom a country where
bunchy-top is prevalent. Since then it has
remained quite free from all disease. To
make a thorough test, the growers have jointly
purchased 2000 suckers at a cost of 2s. eacli
and present indications are that the report
7 IU AT e c. f w or ? ble ’ , W ' J - Allen « fruit-expert
for N.S.W., has also secured some of these
suckers for cultivation in N. S. Wales.
Kurrajong” ; There is little* doubt
that the B.A.T. Co. did all it could to retard
the tobacco-growing industry for many years
even going to the extent, after spending a
large sum on a plantation, of putting it in
charge of a.man who had never grown a leaf
m his life, m order to be able to 1 say “I told
you so. And it was right, for the stuff the
locals produced was vile. In time, however
the growers organised and aired their
Doubles, thus getting the press and the
Government behind them; and then with
improved stuff to sell, good prices were
offered In Vic. nowadays tobacco-leaf sells
well when the quality justifies it, and under
Die guidance of men like Max Valentine
Temple Smith, Marks and Lough, both the
quality and the quantity are still improving.
TRADE-MARKS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Sheaf, the Australian Trade Commissioner in
the East, gives it as his opinion that our tinned
meat and fruit would sell better in India and Chiiia
if the tins were ornamented with pictures of ‘actresses
and loud types of female beauty’ instead of local
fauna and flora.”
For notes and coins et alia
That advertise Australia,
For crests and such regalia,
The emu and the ’roo,
’Possum and native-bear, too,
Let any use who care to;
But—here’s what Sheaf can swear to—
They sell no potted fare to
The Chink or the Hindu.
Boronia and wattle
Portrayed on tin or bottle,
Blazoned on jar or pot ’ll
Provide a brave device ;
But ’side some red-and-whitey
And radiant Aphrodite
Clad (say) in just a nightie
They cut with Pagans mighty
Small quantities of ice.
We deem our platypuses
Engaging little cusses,
Our pleasure in them thus is
A very natural growth.
To us they’re emblematic;
But would an Asiatic
Gaze on them with emphatic
Delight or joy ecstatic?
Not on your blanky oath !
Ring off on Australasian
Mammal and bird creation!
A spell for vegetation
That starts with palm and pine !
Says Sheaf: “To hit the gentle
And always rudimental
And childlike Oriental,
Try, for an incidental,
The female form divine.”
O’er meaty wares and fruity
Paste types of female beauty
Whose patriotic duty
Shall be attraction mute—
Appeal with eyes, not speeches,
That carries where it reaches
From luscious “plums” and “peaches”
Of half a score of beaches,
To boom onr meat and fruit.

“Pantagruel” : A resident of Helidon (Q.),
forced to fall back on prickly-pear to feed
his stock, lias invented a machine that will
make edible pulp of a big load of the stuff
in Bmin. Moreover, it will make two grades
of pulp—coarse for cattle, and sheep, and
fine for pigs. All the animals, it is claimed,
eat the fodder with avidity, and fatten on it.
“T.R.H.”: “Topee's’’ experience in the old
East London theatre (B. 25/10/'23) was
nothing uncommon even 12 years ago. At
Sadler’s Wells in 1911 (the first half of
the programme was fourth-rate vaudeville
and the second half bellowdrama) ladies
who patronised the orchestra stalls (a shil-
lin’) or the boxes (one an’ a “tizz”) brought
quart bottles of beer, renewed them at the
interval, and invested in twopenn'orth of
fish and chips, besprinkled with salt and
vinegar, in between.
“1057“: It isn’t only the N.S.W. cocky
who is being hamstrung by the heavy railway
charges that have followed the building of
dozens of unpayable lines. Country saw-
mills handling cypress-pine find that Ameri-
can timbers are being landed in Sydney at
prices that make it increasingly difficult to
obtain orders for the local product. It is
a case of heavy railway freights for the
homegrown vermin low shipping rates for the
imported; and the Customs duty isn’t suf-
ficient to make up the difference.
“Ashmead”: With a blaring of trumpets
and a banquet to the dredgers, the clearing
of Porpoise Rock to 30ft. below water at
low tide was celebrated at Georgetown
(Tas.) on Nov. 3. The obstacle has been
a deterrent to deep-sea shipping, but now
any boat trading to Aussie can pass up the
Tamar without difficulty on its way to the
temporary deep-water port at Beauty Point.
Trevor Williams, the Marine Board’s ex-
Digger engineer, kept the cost of the job
down to £22,753. Other rocks are to be
tackled later, and then will come the big push
for the northern Tasmanian deep-water port
at Bell Bay, the ultimate Port Launceston.
“Digger’s Father”: Quiller Couch once
wrote an amusing skit on the sort of news-
paper correspondence into which people butt
who have seen some of the letters but
not the one that started it. There is a
perfect example in the recent Bulletin dis-
cussion on the word “tanks” as a military
term. “F.F.F.” winds it up by saying (B.
11/TO/’23) that “all the conjectures that
have appeared are wide of the mark,” and
that Tank was simply the second name of
the inventor of caterpillar traction, “T. T.
Burall; which is precisely the origin that
I quoted—though doubting its strict accuracy
—in the par. which started all the discus-
sion.
“G.R.”: “Stellsby” says (B. 8/11/’23)
he’ll be surprised if the 12-ton yacht Saoirse
reaches Maoriland from Capetown. Why?
A 12-tonner is as safe and weatherly as a
12,000-ton steamer —safer sometimes. Size
counts for very little at sea. The smallest
cockboat may be as dry as a bone when a
big lump of a steamer is shipping it green,
fore and aft. During the war the Thames
penny steamboats went from London to Bag-
dad, via the Bay and the Indian Ocean.
Hundreds of small craft are cruising around
the high seas at this moment, and always
have been. If the Trevessa’s lifeboats could
make the journey in the opposite direction in
the teeth of hard gales and high seas, I don’t
see why the success of a well-found 12-
tonner with a fair wind all the way should
surprise anybody.
“Yarrum” : At a sawmill, 300 miles west
of Sydney, I struck the unsafest old boiler
ever I witnessed in action. It was bound
about with fencing-wire, and patched from
end to end with canvas, tar and cowdung. A
few extra pounds of steam made the boiler's
sides heave and fall like the flanks of a
horse after a long gallop. I asked the man
in charge if his life were insured, and he
said it was for £5OO, but he admitted that
he hadn’t notified the co. of his change of
occupation since he took out his insurance
(he was a drover then). I warned the old
fellow that his heirs might have some diffi-
culty in collecting if he were blown up, but
he reckoned the old boiler was “safe as a
church.” P.S. —Since writing the above I
read of a boiler having blown up in another
part of the State, one man being killed and
three severely injured. Any old rotten kettle
seems to be reckoned good enough for a saw-
mill or a chaff-cutting plant.
“Warihi” : The latest craze in the land of
geysers is for growing Pinus radiata, the
fashionable name for our old friend insignis.
County councils, Harbor Boards, cocky asso-
ciations and syndicates of all kinds have been
planting sand dunes, hillsides, and any por-
tion of the earth’s surface they can acquire,
at a great rate. In the days of long ago our
farsighted ancestors chopped down and burned
the native bush to plant pinus and other
trees; now that the native bush has been
almost eradicated the pinus brings 10s. per
100 super ft. in the tree. Papers are crammed
with ads. selling shares in pine plantations
and promising a competence for old age. The
pine matures in 25 years in the North Island
and 30 years in the South. But there’s
always a fly in the ointment. In this case
it is contained in a. report from Blenheim
that some new disease has already wiped out
half the vegetables in some of the local plan-
tations.
“5 Unit”: “Aerial’s” depreciation of
machine telegraphy (B. 4/10/’23) is not en-
dorsed by Maorilanders working the Murray-
Bandot quadruple duplex system installed
two years back. Telegraphists here, fore-
seeing the demise of the dot-dash game,
learned touch-typing to qualify for Murray
keyboard work. I believe “Aerial” would
qualify his opinions if he visited Wel-
lington and saw 320 words a minute
hastening over our north circuit (Auck-
land) and ditto on the South (Christ-
church). By means of a simple little
instrument at Wellington, Auckland has a
direct one-arm duplex to Christchurch, 720
miles away, and this entails no additional
apparatus except the small “re-transmitter”
mentioned. Within a year both islands will
be a network of the system linking up with
“teletypes” to feed smaller towns unable to
feed the work-devouring Murray-Bandot. If
Morse duplex can be worked over a telegraph
line, the Murray should be easy for it —that’s
our experience. Donald Murray was a
Maoriland pressman, and will live to see the
gadgets bearing his name dealing with 99
per cent, of M.L. telegrams.

Heavier Oil can never replace Metal worn away
"Y” OU are sometimes advised to use a
heavier oil as your engine becomes
worn. Heavier oil, some people will
tell you, provides a better seal for clear-
ances enlarged through wear.
But first consider these facts :
As your car grows older, metal is
worn away by the wear between moving
surfaces. Will heavier oil replace this
lost metal ? No.
The oiling system of your engine was
designed specifically to circulate Lubri-
cating Oil of a certain body. Will this
oiling system —pump, screen, oil pipes,
etc.—distribute effectively a heavier oil?
No.
Any oil, whether heavy or light, when
used in worn engines, will work past the
pistons and piston rings and enter the
combustion chambers, forming carbon.
The heavier the oil, the more aggravated
will usually be the carbon deposit.
What are the wise and only proper
measures to take when your engine is
badly worn ? Obviously, have the bear-
ings adjusted,have new pistons and piston
rings fitted and continue to use the correct
grade of oil for which your engine and
oiling system were designed.
The correct oil for your car —during its
entire life —is specified by the Gargoyle
Mobiloil Chart of Recommendations.
Worn Rings Cause Carbon Deposits
Worn piston rings move per-
ceptibly upward on the down
stroke of the piston; the oil
accumulates under and behind
the rings. Then as the piston
moves upward the rings move
Mobiloil
Make the chart ywr yimlt
to the bottom of the recess,
forcing the oil by the rings.
This is sometimes termed “oil
pumping.” The oil ultimately
reaches the combustion cham-
ber, causing carbon deposit.

“I think the world of
Rexona Soap, for it is the
best Soap I have ever used
for the Skin and Hair.” •
Miss MADGE URQUHART,
Unwin’s Bridge Road,
Sydenham, N.S.W.
Be Dainty! Be Pretty!
Be Attractive!
Be a Rexona Girl!
Bexona Girls are world-famous for their beauty. To be a Rexona Girl
use only Bexona Soap, and enjoy that natural, beauty of the skin and hair which
cannot be imitated; but can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many of thein contain free
alkali; which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Even the Pest
of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Bexona Soap contains the same soothing; healing, antiseptic balsams as
Bexona, the Bapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections is
known throughout the world. . .
Simply use Bexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once or twice a day, and
see if it does not quickly soothe and
cleanse the pores, lessen thie tendency
to pimples, and leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.

The Dark Singer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE whose will is oldest Law
Bade me to His banquet hall
From my pallet of red straw
Under thatch and mossy wall.
“Come and sing to Me,” He cried.
“Though the Word be sweet and wide
In the yellow lanes of Spring,
There are melodies unsung
Where the rose of death is flung
In the pathway of the King.’
I went up by briary ways,
I went up by root and stone,
By the steps of broken days
To the meadows overblown
By the winds of Paradise.
Weary feet had paid the price
When I passed the silver gate,
And the moon was in a tree;
And the fear lay cold on me
That I came an hour too late....
All my little room was blind;
Not a window looked afar.
Might I know if night was kind,
If it held a yellow star.
If a rose against the wall
Heard its fragrant petals fall
In a warm and crimson sigh?
Only, curtained all about
With blue shadowings of doubt,
I was set to sing or die.
Near, and surely breaking bread,
Breaking bread and drinking wine
At the royal banquet spread
Under magic lamps ashine,
Are the Mercies tall and wise
With the gracious seeking eyes,
Calm and still before the King.
Near that tender mystery
Dreaming what I cannot see,
In the little room I sing.
Can they hear me? Will He heed,
Part the curtains, call me in
To a grace beyond my meed
When the deeper draughts begin?
Shall I feel the glory win
Through the curtains open wide
As the morning’s diadem
On the new Jerusalem
Shows her veiled like a bride?
Shall I hear the beat of wings—
All the clear star-travelled words
Coming back through all the Springs
Like a flight of homing birds —
Coming down upon my heart
With the sudden holy smart
Of a joy too great for tears?
Shall I know the fair young faces
Thronging in from all dark places
Are the children of the Fears?
Or shall this be mine to see —
This alone plucked hard from grace—
When the Voice shall call to me
And I stand before His face —
Only One a little tired
With too much too long desired?
Shall I feel that still He waits
Till the songs that are unsung
Bring the morning white and young
Crowned with rapture to the gates?
Only this I surely know.
He whose will is oldest Law
Spoke and called me long ago
From my pallet of red straw;
And I came with zeal to sing.
Golden things imagining,
In the dark I made a song
To the tune of tears that drip.
If His pain be at my lip
I shall drink it sorrow long!
N.s.w.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
When the Devil Was Sick.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“TT’S nothing but a one-way world,” said
Weston in decided fashion. John
Weston usually spoke like that, and
never more so than soon after his decidedly
solid dinner, prefaced by the two regular,
decidedly stiff whiskies and envoied by the
customary cognac. The last drops of the
cognac still warmed his tongue, and his mood
was large.
It is at such moments that less sensible
men picture themselves Napoleons or dream
soberly of “picking the card" on Saturday.
With Weston it was just a time of comfort-
ably increased decision and surety. Plis
opinions were always assured, however. Re-
cently odd little twinges after food and a
feeling of dull heat about the chest had
driven him, most unwilling, to old Dr.
Arnott. Not having suffered any serious ill-
ness, he had decided views, as a rule, about
doctors and such useless cattle; but this
after-dinner unease had become something
of a worry, tending to sap a little of the
customary assurance out of him. However,
the troubling symptoms were not due for a
good half-hour yet, and Weston’s words and
views were very definite.
“The day of the interesting and unexpected
is as dead as the day of miracles,” he went
on, settling more comfortably in the deep-
seated club chair and holding a flaring match
to the fat club cigar. “Life has become a
thing of polity and police, of rules and ruts.
We’re simply automata that do each day our
daily tricks in the manner laid down for us.
Let anyone depart from the set forms and
they immediately gaol him or clap him in
an asylum or send him to social Coventry.”
Weston always thought that he spoke
rather well at this time of day, and he en-
joyed being a little rhetorical.
“Look at the five of us here,” he said with
an expressive lift of the palms—“two barris-
ters, well-fed and over-fed; an almost sleep-
ing surgeon (let him lie) ; that happy thing,
a writer without a conscience; and a com-
monplace manufacturer. Each of us knows
almost in detail what he will do to-morrow
and next week. Day after day we plod the
same old path to office or surgery, club and
home. It’s a straight, well-beaten track with
its orderly, one-way traffic, and the rules of
the road are strict and comprehensive. Any
promising little byways are well fenced off
with a ‘Verboten’ signpost and a big police-
man to make doubly certain that we don't
stray. It’s the eternal sameness and safety
of the whole business that rob it of all
savor. Living has been made too easy and
methodical for us all. Hazard and romance
are forgotten things. I tell you, life was
a much better affair before wireless and
rapid transport reduced the world to the
size of a suburban theatre; when all a man
knew was that outside his own little speck
of earth was the unknown, a land peopled
with unbelievable wonders and unspeakable
horrors; or, further back in the morning of
things, when each one held his woman and
his life by the might of his club, and always
set out to search for a dinner with a reason-
able doubt whether he’d get or be one
Eh? No, I won’t play billiards. It’s too
dangerous.”
A half-hour later, legs stretched to a
glowing radiator, Weston glared at the
lazily-rising bubbles of his whisky-and-soda.
It was the third breach of his abstemious
after-dinner habit, but that damned hot-
brick feeling was certainly worse to-night.
The talk had travelled far without really
unseating him from his hobby. A casual
argument over the drift of modern litera-
ture seemed to wake him from his dormant
state to active eruption again. He spoke
as one with authority, although he was a
successful journalist.
“It’s the same business there,” he said,
savagely breaking the bright band of a
cigar, “rules and ruts, rules and ruts ! Com-
fort, safety and stodge! Everyone knows
that the most worth-while things of all the
arts have been born of minds in actual dis-
tress, want, worry. It’s the ditch, not the
feather-bed, that has seen most of the labors
of genius. No wonder we tend to dreary
commonplace. We’re too well guarded from
all hurt and harm, too carefully packed away
in cotton wool t 0... . Oh, hang your bridge!
Nothing but bridge and billiards, business,
dinner and bed. By rights the whole world
should commit complete and simultaneous
hari-kari. The assembled planets would re-
turn a verdict of suicide while of unsound
mind brought about by the eternal sameness
of things, and on a simple slab on the milky
way engrave its epitaph and apology—‘No-
thing Ever Happened.’ ”
He finished w 7 hat was left of his whisky
in one vicious gulp and sprawled back com-
fortably in the great leather chair. Then
abruptly he sat upright. Those worrying
twinges th&t»i?the whisky had dulled for a
while were again stirring in him, as if some-
one gently blew to life a sleeping coal in
his flesh. Also, he became aware of an un-
accountable light-headedness, a peculiar
whirling faintness. He was conscious of a
little cold sweat on his forehead and on the
palms of his hands, and a most unreasonable
sudden terror. His body stiffened to an
unnaturally strained attitude; his mouth
opened; his lips drew back.
And then, where before had been but a
dull ache, a swift agony suddenly stabbed
and twisted in his chest, a cutting, tearing
torture that seemed to stop his heart in mid-
beat. He knew that he screamed, but the
sound that passed his twisted lips was a
ridiculous hiccoughing grunt. Nausea swam
through him, and all about him receded to a
faraway greyness, and then was quite cut
off as by a black shutter.
At times after that he had vague'impres-
sions of soft, floating movement, of quiet
figures around him, of occasional flashing
lights and murmuring voices, that quickly
fell away and were lost again in that im-
penetrable blackness.
He woke to a spasm of pain and the same
overpowering nausea. Gradually the mist
rolled away, and he saw that someone was
bending over him, dabbing some soft, damp
stuff to his mouth. He twisted his head
petulantly s and closed his eyes to the flashing
specks tlifft danced before them. A cold
hand rested on his forehead, and a quiet
voice broke in on his stupor.
“It’s all right, John, old man.” Without
opening his eyes he knew the speaker for
Dr. Arnott. “Just take it quietly. Don’t
try to talk or think. We’ll fix you, old
sinner, don’t worry. You know, I told you
that I thought you had an ulcer of the stom-
ach. Well, the darned thing’s perforated—■
just to prove I was right, I suppose. You’ve
bled a lot, and you don’t feel happy or
strong. But getting you so early, it’s the
surest thing in the”
A rising tide of faintness again crept over
Weston and the voice died away to an un-
meaning murmur. Later he woke to a feel-
ing of suffocation and a sickly sweetness in
his mouth. There was a rustle about him
broken at times by a muffled slithering and
clanking sound as if someone carefully slid
big nails into a tin basin. A vague white
shape a little way from his face obstructed
his vision, and he struck it angrily aside. A
blaze of lights, an impression of bare white-
ness, a lofty white room, white tables and
dishes, queerly-gowned white figures, startled
his dilated eyes. Then the soft voice of Dr.
Arnott again fell on his ear as if from a far
distance.
What a smooth, oily-tongued old beggar
he was! What high-falutin’ old frauds they
all were, these doctors, living on the fears
of a coddled and pampered society—“care-
fully packed away in cotton-wool.” He had
said that, hadn’t he? Yes, of course, to those
over-fed Philistines at the club, too dazed
and torpid with their safe good-living even
to disagree with him effectively. And how
right he was!
The voice of Arnott still droned on as if
he were speaking through a thick mask.
Weston made out indistinctly something
about not worrying, taking it quietly, but he
wouldn’t bother to listen. He wanted to
think about how right he had been. The
sweet taste was again in his mouth and the
obscuring white stuff once more approached
his face, shutting out the blazing lights. It
was better so ; he could think more clearly.
“Cotton-wool. .. .rules and ruts... .the ditch,
not the feather-bed.” It all came back to
him so easily. He had thought so much
about it. And how very true it was. No
need to go beyond his own case.
There had been no mistake about the power
that had prompted and tormented his pen
in those lost young days. There could be no
false modesty in owning to it, for it was dead
enough now—smothered in cotton-wool —
buried in the soft dulness of the feather-bed.
What dreams he had cast out when he took

You Have Neglected
Your Kidneys I”
That’s why you are tortured with that dull, all-day
backache! It’s the reason for that lameness, soreness,
and those sharp rheumatic pains! And it’s due to neglect
of these early warnings that we find so many people with
gravel, dropsy and other serious kidney ills.
To be well and stay well you must watch your kidneys.
You cannot afford to ignore even the slightest symptom
of kidney weakness. That nerve-racking backache, those
knife-like pcdns, those headaches, dizzy spells and distressing urinary irregularities, while easily
corrected if treated promptly, may prove serious if neglected.
Don’t be discouraged! Use commonsense and take things easier for awhile. Cut down your meat.
Drink plenty of water, and help the weakened kidneys with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. This old,
reliable remedy has a world-wide reputation, and is recommended by scores of your friends and
acquaintances. Ask your neighbor!
SYDNEY RESIDENT CURED.
ames Higgins, Queen Street, Beaconsfield, Sydney, says:—“Some time ago I was taken very badly
witn kidney trouble. I don’t know how to account for it, unless several accidents were to blame. I consulted
three doctors and underwent treatment, and each one, failing to do me good, advised me to go into the hospital
tor an operation. They said my case was almost hopeless, and that an operation was my only chance, as one
of my kidneys was in a very diseased state. I took medicine of all sorts, but everything failed, and I was in
=•11011 pain and misery that I did not care if I lived or died. I had severe pains in my back, giddiness, headaches
d scalding urine. I was completely done up and scarcely able to lift anything. The day was appointed for
he operation, when a friend asked me if I had tried Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. He told me he knew of
i man who was as bad as I was and who had been completely cured, and for good, by this remedy. I post-
poned the operation and commenced using Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. A fortnight later I returned
o work, and the men there r ould not believe the change they saw in me would ever have been possible. There
s no doubt it is wonderful. I am quite cured and as fit for work as a man could be.’’
Sixteen years later Mr. Higgins says:—“Since my cure I have had one or two slight attacks of kidney
disorder, but Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills have always given me quick relief. I am a great believer in this
remedy, and with reason.”

the step that led to ease and security ! It
had been a good deal of a struggle, for hope
was high in him in those days, ambition held
a flaring torch to youth. But his courage
had died when he thought of the sordid fight
ot the years just past.
He had .worked honestly through those lean
years, and for the most part, he thought, well,
ine position offered to him was in a way
proof of that. Long weary hours had gone
to the planning of each smallest part of his
writing, long days to the polishing and re-
polishmg ot it. And the result had been
heartache and despair, cheap clothes and
cheap living at times small hope even of
r, at- And then came this chance of a post
that promised regular comfort and called for
nothing but the regular output of the usual
inane stuff: that had often been the object of
his jeers that and the smothering of an odd
diearn or two. For a week he held out while
he caffed himself imbecile; then he accepted
?, n ”, called himself coward. Sophistry argued
that this need not lead to the dumping of his
private ideals, but he knew in his soul that
<lid WOU < - tlie ye^rs liad proved that it
For a while he clung fiercely to his dreams,
but they faded gradually, and he knew ;fn
emptiness of soul that the growing and assur-
ing of his post did little to fill. Gone and
barely remembered were the days of want
and fear that he had known, but gone, too,
were high hope and the flaring torch. Many
limes and openly lie congratulated himself
on nis comfortable home and his wife, his
iY' L 1 ( ‘ ld) ’ tlio good food and drink and
all the sane pleasures that were his; but,
hidden, there was a sense of futility, a feelin 0-
as of trust betrayed, that distressed him. It
was this hidden, irritating thing that pricked
Inin every now and again to such an outburst
as had occurred at the club. Truth would
out—now and again. Still
, strong and cloying was that sweet
stun . All the membranes of his mouth and
nose and throat seemed to be saturated with
it. Surely he had known that smell some-
where—yes, of course, now he remembered.
Arnott! Often enough about liis clothes, much
weaker, a sort of ghost of this. Why, that
was it- chloroform. Possibly they were
giving- it to him for the pain that was gradu-
ally dying from his chest. He hoped they
wouldn't go too far. Perhaps he should let
them know that the pain was all but gone.
Still, he was very comfortable. Think well,
too. quite clearly—almost too clearly when
he thought of that early struggle between
ideal and expediency.
But he had tried. God knew how he had
Iried in the days before the temptation of
the safe job. And then the grinding out
week after week of all that senseless flum-
mery had seemed to leave little time or room
for ideals. Lord, what twaddle it was! He
had to admit it. Just plain, hopeless in-
anity Society! Surely there couldn’t be
anywhere people with minds so vacuous as to
furnish even momentary resting-robm for such
stuff. Must be, of course. The paper paid
all right. And, anyway, why should he shrug
and pity? If the readers were to be sneered
at, how contemptible was the writer! Great
was the puerile and he was its prophet! God,
what an end to dreams! Still, lie had tried
when....
Oh, what was the use? Betrayed a trust?
Indeed, he had! He had proved himself
weakling and unworthy. It was not the
cruelty of the fight but the cowardice of the
warrior that had lost the day. Cowardice
had lost him that other ideal, too—the
dream-girl, Dorothy. Fear of the fiercer
struggle required for the two, fear for his
own comfort. .. .Lord, what a freer of truth
was this sweet-smelling gas! Hadn’t he
time and again proved to himself that it
was but fear for her that had checked his
love, his cautious love. But let the truth
live. Self-love and self-distrust it had been,
the knowledge that the dream-girl meant the
perilling of his own precious comfort, that
had driven him from her to that comfortable
other woman with her comforting private
money. After all, it meant only another
ideal in the dust, another dream lost and
faded. He was used to it—handy at such
work.
Things might have been so different. God,
for another beginning of the road! He
really believed that things might have been
different, would have been different, with a
little more thought at that time of 20 years
ago, a little better answer to the specious
reasoning of self-interest. Just a wavering
balance wanting but a grain or two of
courage to weigh it on the right side.
Twenty years and a grain more courage!
He was 43 now. Still young, Many be-
ginnings had been made at that age, much
of the world’s greatest work started by men
no younger. He possessed now all that the
years had added of courage and knowledge
of the truth. He could face the trials better
now. Why not? He could still feel the pos-
sibility of tin' power, the dull glowing of an
almost dead spark. He could do it. By
God, he would do it! Some of the ideals
must stay in the dust, certainly. But at
least he could justify his shamed pen. He
felt he could do it still. He knew he could
do it! He would somehow patch or renew
this tattered self-respect of his. Once freed
from the dead weight of that damned
paper....
That was a necessity—the first. And the
relief to be clear for all time from that
maudlin stupidity, to turn his back at last
on that 20 years old mistake. It should
certainly not be hard to fill his place. Many,
he knew, envied him his well-paid post. Let
them have it. Let all the cowards and fools
scramble for it. He would resign at once.
And then to take up the struggle where be-
fore his heart had failed him. There would
be no betrayal this time. Clearly, quite
clearly, he could see the light and now he
would not waver. Hardship and heartache
and weariness of soul, they were all there,
he knew. But he was sure of himself now.
And his ease-loving wife could live well
enough- on her own sure income. Little
enough she would miss him. He was quite
sure that there could be no question of her
shouldering the burden beside him, just as
sure as he was now that with Dorothy there
could have been no doubt of it. Still, it was
probably better so. He could fight better
alone. And how he would fight! Already
he could feel the glow and the glory of it.
To be honest with himself and the world
and to give of his best ! He knew that lie
had something to give. How he wmuld fight
this time!
What a warm comfort he felt now that
the resolve was taken! Why had he delayed
so long? Straightway, to-morrow, he would
act. He could imagine the vacant wonder
on the fat and foolish face of old Johnson,
the co-editor, when he sprang the mine.
Finished with the rag for ever ! Hallelujah !
That sweet stuff—chloroform-—they were
pushing it a bit. Overdoing it! It was be-
coming overpowering, suffocating. Still com-
fortable, though. His head felt peculiar,
swelling like a balloon. Now it was getting
worse, too. Couldn’t they see the balloon
was just about full-stretched? Burst the
confounded thing in a minute. There was a
loud singing in his ears, shutting out the
muffled sounds around. Just hear now that
slithering, clanking noise. Funny sort of
business.
Jove, now he knew! Why hadn’t he
thought before? Dishes, instruments! That
was it. Chloroform, and white-robed nurses,
and doctors, and white-walled operating-
theatre! Damn them, they couldn’t do that.
They couldn’t operate on him unless he per-
mitted. Butchers! Always cutting some-
body about. What right had they to ?
Must stop this, get up. Hang it, they might
kill him. Kill him just when he was start-
ing the good fight. Didn't they know? Re-
signing to-morrow. .. .searching for lost
ideals. ...He must stop it.... Damn them,
they must let him up....
Weston's head was throbbing painfully
when he opened his eyes. His tongue was
sore and his lips were smarting. The old
dull ache in liis chest had been replaced by
a more superficial hurt, as if someone had
recently seared his skin with a hot iron. He
noted idly that he >vas in a strange room,
dimly lit by a lamp that was turned low
and heavily shaded. A quiet figure moved
past the light but failed to interest him.
Dull and heavy and still nauseated he felt,
and after a few moments of appreciation of
the softness of the bed in which he lay and
the soothing quiet of the room, his heavy
eyelids drooped and he was suddenly asleep.
It was many hours later before he woke
again. His confused senses were now clear
and he soon realised what laid happened. Mis
hand slid for confirmation to the bandages
that swathed his body. He looked about the
room. It was empty. In the softened day-
light. in spite of the plainness of the furnish-
ings and the air of severe cleanness about it.
it was comforting. Arnott had often boasted
of his private hospital.
For a while Weston lazily revelled in a
sense of ease and well-being. Soon enough
Dr. Arnott himself, followed by a trim-
figured nurse, came to the side of the bed.
Ilis greeting was quietly cheerful.
“Well. John, old man, you certainly gave
us a devil of a start last night,” he said,
fingers busy at Weston’s pulse. “But every-
thing’s good and proper now, thanks be.
Ulcer all right; fair puncture, but picked up
early enough to save any chance of peri-
tonitis. As the journals have it, the opera-
tion was a complete success, though I say it
who shouldn’t. But I will say, John, that
you’re a hefty scrapper when it comes to an
ana?sthetic. Took the whole theatre staff to
hold you, man. I think you must have been
sticking to the whisky in spite of my warn-
ing.”
He chatted on and Weston answered
lazily, peacefully. And then Dr. Arnott
turned to go. Half-way across the room he
stopped.
“By the way, John,” he said over his
shoulder, “I believe you’re thinking of
chucking your job on the Spectrum?”
“It’s a damn lie.” Weston’s voice was
urgent, angry. “I tell you I”
A sharp twunge caused by his sudden
movement stopped him.
“Here, hold hard, hold hard,” cried
Arnott, “don’t get excited, you idiot! Aftei'
all. you said it yourself. Certainly you were
half under clilo. at the time.”
“Well, look here, Arnott,” said Weston
more quietly, “a man’s not responsible, then,
is he? Raves and all that sometimes, doesn’t
he? Anyhow, you can take it from me that
I’m not thinking of such a thing. Why
should I?"
And, with a little sigh, he snuggled his
head deeper into the soft pillow.

The Twisted Tree.
[FORV THE BULLETIN.]
YOU leave the road by the teamster’s
camp
And take the track to your right.
And hold your way by the reedy swamp.
And come to the timbered height.
Brush-flowers you'll see that are red as wine,
And bracken agleam with dew r ,
And here and there in the morning shine
. Swamp-pools with their imaged blue.
You’ll keep right on till you'll come at last.
Tired out, to the Twisted Tree;
And there you’ll pause, by the tree held fast.
And wonder at what you see.
Rod bloodwoods neighbor it, tall and trim;
'Tis backed by a cliff, green verged;
You’ll note the way that each tortured limb
Is knotted, as though pain-surged.
You’ll think, maybe, of a star-crossed life.
As there ’neatlx the cliffs it stands.
Of something destined to ceaseless strife.
And moulded by hostile hands.
Though nigh it, shapely and hale and tall.
Are bloodwood and pine and box.
You’ll note the way that its tough roots
crawl,
And clutch, at the cloven rocks.
You’ll sigh, maybe, at the moment stirred
By life and its tragedy;
But, oh. you’ll smile if a singing bird
Should light on that twisted tree!
For then, as voicing the morning's bliss.
__ Song issues from leaf and limb.
You’ll say. “Beloved of a bird it is,
Though knotted and gnarled and grim !"
