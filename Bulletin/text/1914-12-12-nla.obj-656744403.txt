The Literary Career
Albert Dorrington, who once (in Aus-
tralia) used to write good stuff, and still
writes, warns the Australian author from
Over There:—
It may safely be said that the writing
mama seizes most men and women at some
period of their lives. Until my twenty-
sixth year I could scarcely write a letter.
The spirit of concentration was strangely
lacking. I was-entirely barren of ideas, and
my first effort at story writing was some-
thing to make the most friendly editor doubt
my sanity of mind. Those doubts may still
exist in many English and Australian news-
paper offices, but the fact remains that a
man may make good at anything if he has
the gift of laying to his job.
To me writing has always been a form of
crucifixion. In the beginning there were
blind desires and no technique. Then came
something that locked like technique, and
Lord, the job grew worse than ever! I am
of the opinion that writing is a form of
mental leprosy, and if ever 1 return to Aus-
tralia I shall seek out with both hands the
Sydney scribe who stated that I “wrote count-
less stories without effort.” In the last 10
years I have not averaged more than two
books a year-short stories included.
What about my serials? I hear someone
ask. Well, they’re included. Up to date
about 10 serials have appeared, with seven
novels sandwiched between. Used-up serials
make poor novels.. A yarn which throbs and
interests from day to day in the columns of
a newspaper reads like a series of illumin-
ated nightmares between the covers of a
book. Very few newspaper serials attain
book-form. [All of Charles Garbage’s do.]
It was in 1905 I threw up my job in
Sydney and settled at Waitara, N.S.W. My
literary cronies used to accuse me of stunt-
ing my intelligence in a place so far removed
from the revitalising influence of kindred
souls. The kindred soul as I knew him was
always linked to a thripenny pub or a blonde
barmaid. My only kindred souls were the
blue and red gums around our little home-
stead, the half-tame ’possum that used to
come every night for the crusts we left on
the wide verandah. The other kindreds were
two baby girls, Marjorie and Leo. I was
what Australians call a steady cove, one who
worried a good deal about next week’s rent,
and was mighty careful about his best serge
suit, price £3 15s.
Often I have stood waiting meekly near the
pay office of some city newspaper while the
star reporters collected their five and seven
pounds, leaving me to draw a few humble
shillings for some slight sketch accepted.
Speaking generally, the Australian papers
paid me as much as the work, was worth to
them. But this fact did not prevent me
from thinking that my stuff might be worth
a good deal more in London or New York.
I left Sydney in 1907, and the combined
ages of my wife and children totalled 23
years. My bank draft, after all expenses
were deducted, totalled as many pounds. I
carried the MS. of a novel, together with a
dozen short stories of the “Bully Hayes”
kind. Blessed is the man with a fighting
temperament!
I found Fleet-street about as interesting as
Little Bourke or Smith-street, Collingwood.
And the men I met affected me like a warm
mud bath. The lowest Jew. ih Whitechapel
could not have felt more alien in tempera-
ment than I. The London editor’s point of
view was always foreign to me. Neither
would he accept my Australianisms.
“What,” he exclaimed one day, “does the
getting outside of a long beer mean?”
I explained meekly.
“And we have ‘heavy wet’ and such things
as ‘centipede creator.’ This ,A-Lrwof stuff
may mean something to Austins, f JKit it’s
pure Ghetto to my readers.” \ m
That was my first real lessqta-mjr English
magazine writing. The slang-riMen Ameri-
can authors, anxious to capture the London
market, have failed to grasp this fact. O.
Henry requires translating to most British
readers.
If it hadn’t been for Bully Hayes my
return to Sydney would have happened three
months after arriving in London. The
first three stories attracted Charles Morley,
the old Pall Mall magazine editor. He
was tremendously interested, and his com-
mission for a whole dozen lifted me out of
Queer-street.
How I worked at those 12 stories ! Sixty
thousand words in all. American and
English serial rights proved a little gold
mine. Then followed the foreign trans-
lation rights for Germany, France, Scandi-
navia and Holland. Yet, when these yarns
were first shown to my agent he shook his
head doubtfully. “Too bold,” he said, “and
too Australiany!”
My first book published with Hutchinson
yielded £l6. The-writing of it occupied
roughly about three years. The kudos it
brought me wasn’t worth a tin of beans.
The moment a publisher sells a thousand
copies of a book he generally "remainders”
the others. Having supplied the libraries
he doesn’t spend his 20 per cent, profit push-
ing your book on an apathetic public.
Let me tell you of the rewards of one book
of collaboration that occupied four years in
the writing. Sure that it would prove a
world-thriller, and sell in hundreds of thou-
sands, I was induced to give up my steady
job to finish it. My collaborator re-cast the
plot half a dozen times and forced me to a
lot of hard work, work done cheerfully on
both sides.
The book went to London and was turned
down by evety publisher who read it. Five
years after it had fallen dead in the agent’s
office I unearthed it and set to work re-
writing the red chapters and transforming a
rather useless tragic ending into a calmer
and more respectable close. It was offered
again and accepted. Six months after publi-
cation it was pirated in America. N.Y.
Times referred to it as the Australian Monte
Christo. In this country it was well re-
viewed. It brought me exactly £2O. So
you see the reward of sweat and travail as
applied to the writing of novels. Take
another aspect of the literary life. A short
story of 2000 words brought me £BO from
The Red Magazine, while The New York
American paid a hundred dollars for U.S.
rights. The yarn occupied about a day in
the writing, and was more profitable than
my first three novels, which represented
roughly about seven years of heart-breaking
labor.
In England some 2000 writers enter and
quit the game yearly. If it were not for
these aspirants the publishers would have
to make the business more profitable for the
author. As things are they get more books
offered for nothing than they require. In
many instances they are paid handsomely
by society leaders to publish and boost
books. What can one say of a trade where
the workmen pay for the privilege of flooding
the market with their wares? Imagine car-
penters and bricklayers advancing heavy
premiums for the sheer joy of being allowed
to work for nothing a week!
There was in London until quite recently
a fiction-writer “who wrote novels' for
English ladies and gentlemen!”
Is there a market in England or America
for Australian stories? Frankly I do not
think so. One does not regard “Bully
Hayes” stuff as Australian. Where one
editor will reach out for a real swag-and-
pannikin yarn a dozen will consider a story
of English country life. American editors
took the trouble to translate and localise a
lot of my stuff until I took the hint. In
1908 I wrote an 80,000-word Australian
novel called Children of the Cloven Hoof.
My London agent offered it to thirty news-
papers and syndicates, including The Boys’
Own Paper and The Girls’ Annual. It
came back dog-eared and greasy, accompanied
by the editorial comment that the matter
was too foreign and uninteresting. Then
my agent’s American secretary, who fancied
the story, re-typed it and carried it to W. L.
Courteny, the literary editor of The Daily
Telegraph. It was immediately accepted,
and I received £350 for the first English
serial rights. Canadian, South African and
Australian rights followed. But in spite of
this I would never again risk six months’
work on another Australian novel unless
commissioned.
The. prices paid for yarns in English
•magazines have dropped 50 per cent, during
the last three years. And the fight between
editors to sharpen their circulations is pretty
fierce. The editor with the fixed idea con-
cerning public taste has been losing his job
with alarming frequency. Three years ago
the editor of a big maga. bought eight of
my yarns. His two rapid successors are not
enthusiastic over his deal. This problem
confronts every new editor. It may take
him years to use up his predecessor’s alleged
mistakes.
With thousands of trained pens in the
field the chances of creating a reputation
grows stiffer each year. And the way stories
are syndicated! A yarn is sold, say, in Aug-
ust, 1914, to The International Magazine
Co. The new-chum author wonders why the
date of publication is scheduled for 1917,
three years ahead. The reason is not far to
seek. The yarn is set up and syndicated
wholesale throughout the provinces. During
1915-16 the story is “morgued,” and appears
finally in the co.’s own maga. at the end of
1917.
The magazine with a* failing circulation is
like a sinking ship: its descent is hard to
arrest. Charles Morley discovered this after
20 years’ editorship of The Pall Mall.
His desperate efforts to keep afloat resulted
in H. G. Wells being commissioned to write
The War in the Air. One might as well
have applied six beer-bottle corks to a foun-
dering Titanic.
About this time I showed Motley The
Radium Terrors. He liked the stuff, but
was afraid my name lacked drawing power.
Astor saw the yarn and decided to chance it.
Frank A. Munsey had bought the U.S. rights.
Well, it appeared with Michael’s double-page
illustrations, and was front-paged right to
the last chapter. And the maga. continued
to slump. Cause of slump was due to the
rise of The London and Nash’s. Both
these magas., together with The Strand,
were buying Kipling, Doyle and Chambers
at the rate of £2OO per thousand words.
Astor was hotly opposed to such a policy,
and preferred to sell out rather than dance
to the big author’s flute.
The literary game will hold me to the
end. But if I were again allowed my choice
of a career I would choose boxing. The
task of outing a nine-stone opponent is dead
easy compared to the incessant effort of
trying to hit nine thousand tons of comatose
British readers.
ALBERT DOERINGTON.
The Upside-Down ward ness of
Things
Every map yet printed of Australia is wrong: it
is upside-down.
The universe has no top or bottom, no right-hand
and no left. The universe is just everywhere, without
frontiers or fences. Nobody could climb to its top ;
not even an angel could slide to its foundations.
There are no lifts. The solar system is somewhere
within the universe, but whether it is situated in
the suburbs or in the centre nobody has yet found
out. And wherever it is at any moment it isn’t there the
next. It is heading straight for a certain group of
stars, but whether it is going north-west or north-
east, or whether those stars will be there when it
arrives—if it does arrive—nobody knows. _ The
solar system is shaped something like a dinner-
plate, with the sun in the centre and the planets
running rings round ■ it. But whether that plate
is horizontal or vertical in relation to the universe
nobody knows. The solar system is revolving in
the ether, not held down, as a top is, by gravity to
a fixed point; and, anyway, there isn’t any fixed
point for it to spin on. For the sun is hurtling on-
ward all the while it spins. The difficulty of
fixing which is the roof of the universe applies tc»
the solar system. For it is not spinning on one
point, the underneath' point, which, as has been
explained, does not exist; but it spins on two points,
one one side and the other the other side, and neither
points exist anyway. Presumably one of these
points might be called the top and the other the
bottom of the solar system ; but not even Revelation
has mentioned which is which.
When we come to the earth we find that it
revolves not perpendicular to the plane of its arid
the other planets’ orbits. It spins iean * ’ con _
its axis is really skewiff. Its top or , vo ’ u ia n ’t
sidered in relation to the solar system, cu ity
be its north or south pole. You see the j -
about fixing a topness or bottomness to amvtnmg.
We have a vague idea that Heaven is somewh e
near the top of the universe, and Hell somewhe
in the basement. But since Heaven is , t
heads, and the earth is round, Heaven would have to
be everywhere and Hell somewhere in the cen f
this particular earth. And, knowing the n ® ra k er 0 ,
our friends who have died and gone to Hell, it can
easily be computed that there isn t room for tnem
all there.
There being, thus, no topness and no bottomness,
and presumably no sidewaysness, in either the uni
verse, the solar system or the earth, it begins to
become apparent that the map-makers are f
too much. They have always assumed that tne
North Pole is the top pole: they put it always at
the top of their maps. But northness does not pre-
suppose topness, nor southness underneathness. ine
North Pole is no more the top pole than is tne
South Pole. Simply because the northern hemi-
sphere became civilised first, and first learnt to
draw maps, the inhabitants of the northern hemi-
sphere considered themselves top dogs. They did
not content themselves with this. At first there was
no southern hemisphere to bother about; hut when
that unpleasant fact dawned upon the northerners
they simply relegated the southern hemisphere to
the bottom of their maps. And they labelled
Maoriland the Antipodes, and printed maps of Aus-
tralia upside down. They even labelled certain
places the East, or the South, or the Near East, or
the West. These sign-posts are correct for only a
small part of the globe—that of Western Europe.
To England Australasia is the South, the Antipodes,
the Balkans are the Near East, Japan the Far East.
But to us Japan is the North, Africa the West,
South America the East, and England the
Antipodes.
Among the many upside-down notions that our
earlier colonists brought religiously from the North
was this strange conception of the northern hemi-
sphere as the top, or buttered, layer of the planet.
And their sign-posts they transplanted and set pp
pointing the wrong way in Australia: they are
standing yet, looking ridiculous, in front of the
editorial offices of the Australian press. Leader
writers, who oug“ht to know better —that is, if you
don’t personally know the persons who _ write
leaders: if you do, you will never be surprised at
anything they write —persist in standing on thei r
heads when writing of Japan as the East and of
ourselves as Antipodeans. No country can be the
Antipodes of itself: neither Maoriland nor Australia
is populated by Antipodeans.
This curious situation is chiefly due to the upside-
downness of the map-makers. There is no topness
residing in the term “North.” The North Pole has
no valid claim to be considered the top pole. No
scientist can bring forward evidence of any topness
or toppism or toppishness residing in the word
“North.” And no overt claim is ever made concern-
ing the inherent superiority or skyscraperishness of
the North. Yet the obsession remains, undefined,
unprovable. The chief consequence to us is that it
compels Australia to stand on her head. When she
was discovered the chart-makers drew her upside
down, with her head buried in the sea and her heels
waving in the air. They regarded Australia as a
sort of basement, or cellar, to the globe. And Aus-
tralians have grown up content to regard themselves
as dragging out a humble existence in the basement.
Obviously this attitude is all wrong. Australia
isn’t a basement; it is the top-floor of a 50-storey
flat, full of life and light and air; and it looks not,
like a gravedigger, into the ground, but upwards to
its towering South Pole.
The South Pole has as much right as the North
to be regarded as the top:dog among poles. The
North Pole is regarded by the Northern Hemisphere
as its top. Australia has as much right to consider,
even to hail, the South Pole as its top. For us
southerners southness must stand for topness. Our
continent looks to the south, aspires to the south.
We make our explorations to the south ; we make the
Antarctic our own. Nobody could aspire to a cellar
or look upwards to a basement. Therefore the map
of Australia, henceforth, must be placed on its feet—
at least, in all Australian publications. Let us see
how it looks, with the assistance of The Bulletin’s
official map.
Australia, it will be seen, stretches to the top of
the globe; The waters between the top of Tasmania
(S.E. Cape) and the Antarctic are Australian waters.
Wilson’s Promontory is the top of the Australian main-
land, and Melbourne is the topmost capital city on
the continent. Cape York is its lowest extremity,
York Peninsula being a long taproot nourished in
tropical waters. Darwin is the continent’s backdoor,
and like other backdoors it allows entrance to unde-
sirable strangers that would not be tolerated at the
broad front entrance. It is rather too hot and
stuffy at our backdoor; but the front of this vast
edifice is swept by cooling breezes. Our backyard
abuts upon the backyards of Asia: the front garden
of our white stuccoed residence looks out on' the
whiteness of our allotment of Antarctica.
It must be remembered that the new conception of
our rightful position does not require any alteration
in the geographical terms, north, south, east or west.
South-East Cape, at the top of Tasmania, is still
south-east. Southness merely implies, to us, top-
ness. Sydney is still on the east and Perth on
the west. But it must be remembered that, in
viewing the new map, east is on our left hand and
west on. our right. The proper way to look at Aus-
tralia is from the Equator or the North (or bottom)
Pole. Anyone taking up his position on that Pole
or the Equator and looking up,-southwards, would
see Australia exactly as it appears in the new map.
The trouble with- the old map-makers was that they
stood on the .Equator and turned their backs on Aus-
tralia. ' ~
So in our new map of the globe the Northern
Hemisphere must occupy the lower portion. And
the supercilious habit of the European map-makers
of placing Australia right in the corner of their
maps of Oceania must be similarly rectified. Aus-
tralia is the centre of the world —to us, just as Eng-
land is the centre of the world —to the British. The
it owns not one ocean, but three. It occupies a com-
manding position at the junction of the Antarctic,
the Pacific and the Indian Oceans. And , the British
Archipelago will be curtly labelled the Antipodes, and
will be found, if looked for carefully, somewhere away
down in the lower, or northern, hemisphere, at the
bottom of the rectified map. Only with this long-
deferred rectification will Australia recognise her
aspirations, only then will she breathe freely, no
longer standing on her head.

I HAVE for thirty-seven years declared war on all Scalp Diseases and Hair
Troubles. I hate the sight of Baldness, and have spared no expense in
putting together preparations all-powerful in their effect to remove those
enemies to one’s good appearance. Nature never intended man to have a bald
head.
It is unnatural and unsightly, and, therefore, ought to be removed. If
my instructions were carried out Baldness would be prevented in the rising
generation, and heads which are now partially bald could be covered
with an improved growth of hair. When we see how necessary hair is to a
person’s good appearance, one is surprised that its treatment should be placed
in the hands of impostors and charlatans who derive an excellent trade by the
sale of worthless and often injurious compounds, for which they claim impos-
sible merits and charge extravagant prices.
If you have any Scalp Disease or Hair Trouble, you can consult me with
the knowledge that every word spoken and preparation sold carries with them a
guarantee that they are the result of a life’s study of Scalp and Hair Diseases,
and what is necessary to remove them. I have been thirty-one years following
my profession in the heart of Australia. That ought to give you confidence in
consulting me if there is anything wrong with your scalp and hair.
Gentlemen with dry, irritating scalps, who are losing their hair, should use
Parasene at night and Cosmo in the morning, and wash the head once a week with
Shampuna. Price: Two months’ treatment—Victoria, 12/-; four months, 237-
Other States, 12/6 and 23/6.
Ladies for the same trouble should use Restorer and Cosmo, and wash the hair as
often as necessary with Shampuna. Price as above.
NATURALINE, for Grey Hair, Beard and Moustache.
Natural!ne is a splendid preparation. It acts quickly, naturally and effectively,
and is perfectly harmless. Made in all colors. Get the right strength.
No. 1 for light brown hair, medium for medium brown hair, No. 2 for dark brown or
light black, and extra strong for very black hair. Price, by post: Victoria, 6/3;
Other States, 6/8.
READ THESE REMARKABLE TESTIMONIALS.
Doctor at Hawthorn says: “If there is anything in the world that will
make your hair grow, Mr. Holland’s preparations will. I have seen their
effect for many years, and know them to be of the most genuine character.”
Doctor at Inglewood says: “Please send me the usual half-dozen bottles
of Parasene. It suits my scalp and hair better than any other preparation
I have ever used.”
Doctor at Malvern says: “Your treatment has done wonders for my
brother’s scalp and hair. The bald patches have all gone, and his hair is
quite thick again.”
Doctor in Collins Street, Melbourne, says: “I was surprised to find
Miss P.’s trouble (Alopecia Areata) yield to your treatment so quickly.
Some of the patches had not grown any hair for more than seven years.
The disease has been quite cured, and the hair has grown splendidly on all
the patches.”
Doctor at St. Ivilda says: “I have had Alopecia Areata for over two
years. As it will not yield to my treatment, I have come to you. We
know you have studied these diseases for many years; that is why I have
confidence in placing myself under your treatment.” His confidence has
been more than justified, as the disease has yielded readily to my treatment.
Mrs. G., Hawthorn, nearly the whole of one side of her head bare;
cured in a few months. Miss S., Kew, bald patches for six years; cured in
seven months. Mrs. W., Sale, wore a wig for many years ; twelve months’
treatment produced a splendid growth of hair.
Father R. says: “Please send me Parasene and Exemo. I cannot speak
too highly of your excellent hair restorer. It is the only genuine stuff on the
market. As I have tried nearly all others I think I am competent to pass
judgment. The Shampuna is also a splendid wash.”
Gentleman writes from Bendigo: “My hair is growing splendidly with
your treatment. It is marvellous how your preparations cure diseases of the
scalp. I know mine was in a dreadful state, but now the trouble is nearly
gone, and the hair is growing on the bald parts.”
These testimonials could be multiplied a thousandfold, but I think they
are sufficient to convince you of the fact that if you have any scalp disease
or hair trouble you cannot do better than consult me!

CHRISTMAS TIME AND SOMETHING
ABOUT THE JUSTIFIABLE PRIDE
OF EUROPE.
This Christmas season is one when it is
customary for the tail of Asia to be greatly
exalted in the churches, because Asia is
regarded as the mother of religions and an
old bulky personage who is to be revered
accordingly. And Asia has certainly been
prolific in religions—living, dead and partly
dead. It (and the adjacent continent of
Africa) grew nearly everything that
remains in the way of idolatry, witchcraft,
demonology, and bottomless and roofless
superstition. It is supposed to have devel-
oped the idea of ancestor-worship, but that
is more than uncertain. The mound-
builders who pervaded Europe in the
dimmest past evidently had some glimmering
of the idea, and either continent may have
caught it from the other, or both may have
derived it from some common source of
which all trace has been lost. Again Asia
developed the Brahmin creed which took
possession of India; but it was the ruddy
men in boots who came into India from the
North, not the pallid men in petticoats whom
they found in the country, who established
the new creed, and these ruddy men in boots,
though now largely absorbed and obliterated,
were apparently of the same race as the
Europeans. Buddhism was an offshoot or
reformed version of the previous doctrine,
and its founder was apparently also of the
same stock which made Europe.
Christianity sprang up in the part of Asia
which is most convenient to Europe and
the part which had been longest under
European influences. In fact, it can be
claimed, without much straining of proba-
bilities, as a European creed. And its later
untidy brother, Mohammedanism, adopted a
great deal of the Christian faith at second-
hand ; so it was also, to some extent, a
European production.
Asia has certainly been prolific in re-
ligions, even though they may in some cases
have been born there by accident, just as an
Englishman may be born there by accident;
but it has added little else to the sum total
of civilisation. It produced nothing worth
speaking of in the way of mechanics. Even
the humble wheelbarrow, as a means of
locomotion, was beyond its mental scope.
It didn’t make roads. It was poor in archi-
tecture ; the best architectural monuments of
India are the work of Italians, and the
Greek kingdoms which once hung out in
what is now Turkestan may have lent a hand
m e - Q ,k e^ore an Italian came to devise the
laj Mahal and similar glories. Asia never
conceived an idea of popular self-government.
Ihe Arab has often been quoted as a splendid
sample of sudden civilisation, but the Arab
only did great things when he came in con-
tact with Greek culture and Greek know-
ledge. Then, like an educated ape, he was
a brilliant imitator for a little while, after
which, the impetus having died away, he
sat down on his tail and perished out of
the brotherhood of progressive communities,
and became liis old self again. Asia’s real
claim to consideration in the Christmas
season lies in the fact that it has supplied
the world with religions—heaps and stacks
or religions. And, except in a geographical
sense, that claim is doubtful.
In days of very long ago the people of
the Grecian isle of Crete had attained to the
highest civilisation which the world knew in
their time, or for very long afterwards. But
an overwhelming enemy came upon them
from parts unknown, and vast numbers of
these white folk put to sea to look for new
homes. Many of them settled along the
coast of Palestine, and became known as the
Philistines (i.c., the People of the Sea)—a
race wholly different from the so-called Phili-
stines of to-day, who are Arabian semi-
savages with bare legs and a refined taste in
robbery. About the same time a barbarous
and dishevelled and uncultured race poured
into Palestine on the landward side, and
tlm Semite and the Greek met. The Semites
claimed that they had a Divine gift of the
land, but if. so the gift was long delayed.
The Phoenicians, a Hamitic race who long
passed for Semites, held the north-west cor-
ner all through the days of the kingdom of
Israel and for long after Israel was
gone. The Philistine Greeks, though they
lost much of the coast-line, held the south-
west corner even when the Kingdom of
Judah was reduced to a single city, and
Manasseh, the king, was little more than
a country or bush mayor. For centuries the
Canaanite kingdom of Jerusalem divided the
northern from the southern Hebrews, and
divided them so effectually that the nation
never united again except in the brief period
represented by part of the reign of David
and the reign of Solomon. .Tudaii, the
greatest tribe of all, never really conquered
its land; the Wilderness of Judsea was
abandoned, and is a wilderness to this day.
The tribe of Simeon had an allotment right
up against the Greek settlements. Appar-
ently it took one long look at its European
neighbors and then fled back terrified into
the desert, for it vanished early out of the
Scripture story. Most of the other tribes
also vanished early. In fact, very soon only
Judah and Ephraim were clearly dis-
tinguishable. The Greeks in Palestine were
builders, seamen, artisans, workers of
metals, artists, jewellers, and in all proba-
bility the inventors of the alphabet, which
is called Phoenician because Phoenician
ships carried it to Europe. The Hebrews,
fighting with bone and flint and wooden
implements, and living amid the anarchy of
the Judges—who included the wild comedian
Samson, . described as facing his enemies
armed with the jawbone of a donkey, be-
cause he had no blacksmith to make him
any better outfit—led most of the time a
precarious and humble life among the hills
and hoped for better times, which were slow
in coming.
At long last David, the one supremely
great soldier that the Hebrews produced,
united the people into one kingdom, and
temporarily broke the power of the Greeks.
But he knew the Hebrew instability and
the Hebrew limitations. In all the time
that the Two Kingdoms lasted the Chosen
People seem to have built only one new city
—Samaria-—and that was apparently done
by foreign workers from Phoenicia. Even
the Temple of Solomon was the product of
foreigners. The wood-work was made by
Phoenicians because the agricultural Hebrew
couldn’t hew a plank straight, and the metal-
work by a Tyrian because, though Hebrew-
dom had apparently learned from its
European neighbors how to make the simple
weapons of the period, the refinements of
the metal-worker’s art were far beyond it.
All early Hebrew art was, in fact, a crude
imitation, even down to such matters as
bowls and pitchers. Every now and then
the nation, dwelling peacefully in its mud
hovels, received an uplift from outside, but
presently it sagged back to the old level and
the old hovel, and waited for another foreign
inspiration. The only public work which
has been blamed, with some show of pro-
bability, on the Chosen Folk of the days
before the Captivity is the conduit of IJeze-
kiah at Jerusalem. That disgraceful tunnel
was apparently started from both ends by
men who had no idea how to keep a straight
line and make both ends meet. And on the
evidence they seem to have groped under-
ground and driven hither and thither and
up and down and in and out and round
about for a pair of needless years, before
they joined the extremities of their strange
contraption by pure accident. And the early
Hebrew knew so little of the sea that he
made Noah, the patriarch, go out on his
voyage in a chest, a shin being then beyond
his range of vision. David, viewing the
situation, hastened to enlist many of the
defeated Philistines into his service. Appar-
ently these men of European descent formed
a standing army to repair the deficiencies of
the heroic but tumultuous and unstable
Hebrew levies.
* * * *
So the Greek race came to Jerusalem
early. And when the two badly-gummed-
together kingdoms separated after a very
brief connection it is notable that the one
with the large infusion of European elements
established an orderly monarchy under a
dynasty that lasted from David to the Cap-
tivity. while the one that was almost entirely
Asiatic led a mad career under a succession
of military adventurers. Few kings of old
Israel died in their beds. The dynasty of
Jeroboam lasted through two reigns and
ended in wholesale murder. The " dynasty
of Baasha lasted through two reigns and
ended similarly. Zimri, who was also
murdered, was a dynasty-by himself: He
remained on deck for seven days, and then
was slaughtered. Tibni was' a one-man
dvnastv also. The House of Omri endured
through four reigns, and the House of Jehtt
through five, but each came to the usual
gory finish. Shaixum, another one-man
dynasty, persisted for a month and was
butchered. The Menahem dynasty covered
the period of two kings, and then the usual
massacre happened. The rest of the history
of Iskael consisted of two one-man
dynasties and an interregnum or period of
chaos. The last two kings died by violence,
and Israel vanished for good. Yet all this
time the microscopic southern kingdom, with
its infusion of European blood and culture,
kept afloat on the troubled sea of politics.
The ship leaked a good deal, but even under
Manasseh it didn't quite sink, and its
people maintain their national existence to
this day. The only time when Judah re-
lapsed into utter anarchy in later days was
when the Asiatic element revolted against
the European element and held Jerusalem
on old Asiatic principles. Then there were
three civil wars inside the city, and a siege
outside, and all was chaos —like the Book of
Judges.
After the Captivity European influences
became stronger. The country was ruled
by Alexander of Macedon and afterwards
by the Seleucid kings—all of Greek descent
—who had their headquarters at Antioch.
Egypt to the south, after a long dependence
on Greek soldiery in the last days of the
Pharaohs, became a kingdom ruled by
sovereigns of Greek descent. The Greek
element in south-western Palestine was still,
so far as we know, not wholly extinct. The
cumbrous Hebrew language was largely dis-
placed by Greek. The Romans, whose cul-
ture was mostly Greek, followed and took
possession. The Saviour came and published
His wonderful gospel in a European lan-
guage—Greek—as was natural to one who
was a European subject. And after Him
came Paul, the chief apostle, a Roman citi-
zen who invented theology, and who did a
great deal to fill the New Testament with
writings in a European language addressed
to the European peoples of Rome and Cor-
inth and Salonika, also to Philemon
(apparently a Greek) and Titus (appar-
ently, by his name) a Roman.
* * + *
The pedigree of the Saviour is, and will
probably always remain, a mystery. The
Christians, who believe in Him, allege that
His father was a supernatural being—cer-
tainly not an Asiatic. The Jews, who do
not believe in Him, allege that there is well-
attested tradition to the effect that His
father was a European—a Greek officer in
the legion stationed at Caesarea, beside the
shores at Galilee. The Scripture throws no
light on the matter. It traces a long ances-
tral line including many foreigners, such as
Ruth of Moab, and many persons of doubt-
ful origin, such as the stolen wife of Uriah
the Hittite; but the line ends with Joseph.
the carpenter who carped at Nazareth, and
whose professed workshop is still shown to
tourists at a moderate fee (4fd.). And as
the Scripture distinctly states that Joseph
was not in any sense the father of the Re-
deemer, this partly-Hebrew pedigree is use-
less and apparently purposeless. As regards
the mother of Christ, history is a blank and
legend is almost equally blank. She came
from Bethlehem, on the edge of the country
which was occupied by Europeans before the
Hebrew came into the land. Her native town
was within six miles of Jerusalem, which was
garrisoned by European troops when the
Hebrew monarchy first showed its head de-
finitely above the waters of oblivion and
affliction. Also, she was born at a time when
Palestine had become almost as much Euro-
pean as Asiatic. Her name is wholly unlike
the typical Hebrew female names—those of
the Dinahs and Deborahs and Sarahs and
Rebeccas and Hephzibatis and such-like.
She may, for all the evidence to the contrary,
have been by descent a girl of Gaul or Ger-
many or Greece, for the time was one of
considerable migration. At all dvents, legend
represents her Son as a tall, fair-haired Man
of the northern European type, wholly differ-
ent from the short, dark-haired Hebrew.
And, as already mentioned, He was a Euro-
pean subject who promulgated His teaching
in a European speech.
The Old and New Testaments have little
connection save that they were published in
the same country. They were issued in
different languages and under different Gov-
ernments. The first is full of legend and
history, and elaborate ritual and ponderous
denunciation, and sacrifice of beasts, and
contains hardly a semblance of promise of a
future life. The second is full of hope and
benevolence, and alive with assurance of the
future. If they were the work of men of the
same race then one would imagine that the
race had greatly changed, yet the story of
John of Gischala and Simon, the son of
Gioras, and the Robbers and the Zealots and
the other defenders of Jerusalem in the days
of Titus certainly suggests that the race
hadn’t changed worth a cent and that the
hard, valiant, uncompromising old Jew was
still the same Jew. At all events, the short,
sturdy, dark-haired, dark-browed pessimists
of the Old Order rose against the tall, fair-
haired Prophet of the New Order, and
Pilate, the Dago, standing between them,
washed his hands and disclaimed all responsi-
bility. Here or herabouts, ends the case for
Europe as the mundane source of Christian-
ity. It may not be wholly convincing, but
many worse cases have kept afloat and have
even secured a majority verdict from the
jury.
THE NEED FOR A FRIENDLY
TARIFF AGAINST BRITAIN.
When the Australian Foreign-trader is feel-
ing good—which he does occasionally, though
he doesn’t deserve to —he is accustomed to
clamor that we ought, as a loyal community,
to establish Freetrade between Australia and
Britain. Or, at the very least, we should
give the Ma Country a preference which
almost amounts to Freetrade. Failing that,
we are no better than pro-Boers or anar-
chists, or something of the sort. Here the
logical sceptic might inquire: (1) Whether
Freetrade with Britain is good for Britain;
12) whether the British person really wants
it.
England, which is the predominant part-
ner in the British alliance, is a crowded place
in this year of strife, 1914. It has about 650
people to the square mile. It grows about
enough food to supply it for two months in
the year, and as regards the other 10 mouths
it depends on imports. This is partly due
to agricultural mismanagement, but it is cer-
tainly due, in a very great measure, to pres-
sure of population. The United Kingdom
has to maintain the most costly navy in the
world, and the most costly navy in all his-
tory, in order to protect the routes along
■which its food supplies come. It is alwa.ys
haunted with the fear that trouble may arise
between it and the people from whom it buys
its chop and its loaf. A war with Germany
is bad enough, yet it only costs men and
money—or else credit. Credit is pretty good
in London, and men are plentiful enough in
a country like England, where every 640
acres holds about 650 live specimens of
humanity. But a disagreement with two
American Powers —the United States and
Argentina—might almost reduce England to
famine, even if the enemies refused to come
out and fight; and might make the British
loaf almost as difficult to get as the Koh-i-
-noor, and much more difficult to get than the
Great Hoggarty Diamond. Then England, by
reason of overcrowding and the lack of space
for its people to graze upon, is afflicted with
a vast and very costly pauper problem. Like-
wise it has a considerable burden on its back
because it has to defend, on imperial con-
siderations, an almost empty place like Aus-
tralia. Likewise it has to find loans for
Australia, because if it doesn’t find the new
loan to keep its thinly-peopled debtor afloat,
the debtor may burst on his houseless plains,
and the old loan be lost. So the thickly-
peopled and low-wage and pauper-burdened
land has to keep an eye to the protection
of Australia on financial and commercial
grounds, quite apart from the pomp of the
empire and the dignity of the flag. England,
as the most crowded member of the British
partnership, would probably feel a great deal
stronger if it had less people, less pauper-
ism, less overcrowding, less dependence on
foreign food supplies, and more breathing
space. Also, it would feel stronger if a
place like Australia had more population,
and didn’t hang on to it so abjectly in the
matter of cash and guns, and if Australia
offered a better field for the British immi-
grant. J. Bull really wants to get rid of
his immigrant—in moderation. Density of
population isn’t everything, as was proved
by the notorious case of the Black Hole of
Calcutta.
But, by a very natural process of reason-
ing, the crowded Briton doesn’t want to
emigrate to a country which has Freetrade
with England, or which gives England a
preference almost amounting to Freetrade.
If he leaves Shoreditch because he is tired
of the excessive competition of Shoreditch,
he doesn’t want to go all the way to Mel-
bourne. only that he may find Shoreditch
competition as strong as ever. There is no
reason to believe that he wants to abandon
the British flag, and cease to be a British
subject, and train up his sons to be Britain’s
possible enemies. Yet to improve his posi-
tion it is practically necessary that he
should select a country which has a remorse-
less tariff against Britain. Most of him
went to the United States until the Unitdd
States began to be rather crowded, and then
the strenuous anti-British tariff of Canada
began to attract him. As a result of his
search for a place which is comparatively
free from Shoreditch competition there are
more English-speaking people in the United
States than there are in the United King-
dom, and regarded as British allies they
are better in theory than in practice. If
Australia had had, during the last half-
century, an uncompromising anti-British
tariff it might have four times or six times
its present population, and be a better bul-
wark of the Empire than it is. Incidentally
the United States might have less people to
make annoying remarks to Britain about
the Monroe Doctrine.
Eureka Stockade was recalled by a naval
wedding at Sheerness (Eng.) on August 22
—that of Commander Murray Rede, R.N.,
son of the late Colonel Robert Rede, of Mel-
bourne, and the daughter of a Dr. Clement,
of Hove (Eng.). The Commander joined
his ship, then ready for sea, immediately the
party left the church. Colonel “Cocky”
Rede, as his chums called him, came to Vic-
toria in 1851, being then 32 years of age, and
got employment in the Gold Commissioner’s
office at Korong. He was Resident Commis-
sioner at Ballarat in 1854; and thouah he
was said to have given satisfaction at head-
quarters, it was deemed advisable to recall
him after the Eureka Stockade trouble. Had
he been “recalled” before the outbreak, it
was generally thought that things would have
turned out differently. However, the Bal-
larat troubles did him no official harm, for
he was afterwards made sheriff. His first wife
was a daughter of J. F. Strachan, M.L.C.,
of Geelong; they had an only son, born in
1872 —apparently this Commander.
“T. 0.1.”: There is a legend that John
Tawell, who was afterwards hanged at
Aylesbury for the murder of his mistress,
emptied a large quantity of spirits into Syd-
ney Cove, as an indication of his conversion
to temperance principles; and posterity—his
posterity—has applauded him accordingly.
The facts don’t make so pretty a story. The
Quaker missionaries Backhouse and Walker
were in Sydney at the time (1836). They
had consented to open the new Quaker meet-
ing house in Macquarie-street, built by Tawell
and presented to the Quakers (Tawell, by
the way, forgot to hand over the title deeds).
The visiting Quakers were preaching teetotal
abstinence, and Tawell, who was in the wine
and spirit trade as a side-line, could not con-
sistently keep a stock of the curse and still
wear his new halo. However, he wasn’t
reckless. First he carefully told Governor
Bourke, and asked his Ex. to remit the duty;
and as the stuff was in bond, Bourke con-
sented. There were five puncheons of rum
containing 492 gallons, and two hhd. of
Geneva containing 116 gallons. They had
been sent to Tawell as an investment by his
agent in England, and there are doubts
whether Tawell or his principal stood the
loss even of the small original cost. A Cus-
tom House officer had charge of the destruc-
tion. The casks were placed on a staged
boat and taken to the middle of the Cove,
where the heads were removed and the con-
tents emptied.

The Author and the Typewriter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mr. SHAKSPEARE, a celebrated dramatic
author, was hard at work upon a new play
entitled “Julius Caesar.” The date announced
for its production was near at hand, and the author
was working overtime to fulfil his contract with the
management. He had got well into the third act
to the Forum scene, in fact. Mark Antony was about
to mount the pulpit to preach his now celebrated
funeral sermon over the remains of his friend Julius
Caesar, when the author suddenly experienced symp-
toms 'of a nervous breakdown. The symptoms
declared themselves in the form of writer’s cramp,
failing eyesight, pains in the head, spots before the
eyes, palpitation, vertigo, bad dreams, and all the
rest of it. The alarmed author consulted a nerve
specialist, who overhauled him and ordered a com-
plete rest, a long sea voyage, and at once. “And,”
added the specialist, “you must also give up whisky
and tobacco and any other pleasant little vices you
may be attached to.”
“Can’t get away just now,” said the dramatist.
“Must finish my tragedy. Penalty clause in the
contract.”
“Well, then, why not dictate your stuff to an
amanuensis? If you go on as you are, you will be
blind in no time, and your hand will be permanently
crippled.”
So our author advertised for a typist who must
also be an expert stenographer. She came with a
certificate of high efficiency from a local business
college; a fluffy-haired blonde with eyes like a
startled fawn. She was engaged at first sight, and
proceeded at once to “take down” Mark Antony’s
harangue to the Roman mob, at the dictation of the
Bard of Avon. Now drowsiness is one of the stig-
mata of a nervous breakdown. At the end of
Antony’s long-winded speech the author fell asleep,
having first given his amanuensis a lethargic in-
junction to typewrite her shorthand notes, and hand
them to the printer, who was shrieking out for copy.
Next morning the printer sent in a galley-proof of
the oration.
Here it is :
[Jul. Cjbs. 57]
Ant. :
Fiends, rum ’uns, up-country people, lend me your
cars
I came to bully Siezer, not to please him.
The anvil that mend to look after the
Goods is often tarred with her bones.
So let it be. With scissors' the nobby brute
Hath told you, Kaiser was amphibious:
If it wears so it was a greasy salt.
And greasily hath Snoozer Hansarded it.
Here under the leaves let the brute take a rest,
(For Asbestos is a huggermugger man —
So are they all tall hubble-bubble men.)
Come I to squeak and sneeze at Snoozer’s funeral.
He was a find; a hatful of dust to me,
But Brute he says he was Suspicious,
And Booth he is a hobble-skirted man.
He hath brought many captains home to roam
Whose rams’ sons did the General’s coffee spill !
Died thus at sea, sir—Seems Suspicious.
When the poor have lied, Louisa hath swept.
Ablutions should be made of steamer’s duff ;
Yet Bulltoad swears he was religious ! Huh 1
You all did see that on the lump-o’-coal
Three times I offered him a half a crown
Which twice he did refuse. Was this nutrition ?
Yet Bluenose says he litigious,
And sure he is a rumble tumble man.
Beer for me.
My hat is in the cottage there with Susan,
And I must pause till Susan sends it back,
Or go home barefooted....
Ist Cit. : Methinks there is much reason in his
sayings.
Perhaps there was, but the printer didn’t trouble
his head about that. He merely followed copy from
the typewritten MS. and sent in his galley-proof as
above.
Shakspeare swore a good deal and finished Julius
Ccesar” by hand, in spite of medical advice. Ann
Hathaway gave the fawn-eyed girl a regular job to
wash her cottage windows and show sightseers over
Shakspe.are’s birthplace and things.
The printer above referred to started a dramatic
newspaper called the Stratford Barnstormer, and
married the fluffy-haired one (there must be some
heart interest in a short story nowadays), who gave
Ann Hathaway a week’s notice. She contributed a
series of articles entitled “Great Men I Have Washed
Windows. For.”

The Fairy West.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I.
WE wrote and sang of a bush we never
Had known in youth in the Western
land ;
Of the dear old homes by the shining river,
The deep, clear creeks and the hills so
grand.
The grass waved high on the flat and siding,
The wild flowers bloomed on the banks so
fair,
And younger sons from the North came
riding
To wine-clad homes in the gardens there.
We wrote and sang—and the Lord knoivs
best —
Oh, those dear old songs of the fairy West!
We dreamed and sang of the “bustling
mother” ;
The brick-floored kitchen we saw so clear,
The pranks and jokes of the youngest brother,
The evening songs of our sisters dear.
The old man dozed in the chimney corner,
Or smoked and blinked at the cheerful
blaze,
Or yarned with a crony-—old Jack Horner —
Who’d known him back in the Digging
Days.
BEYOND A JOKE.
FATTY: "Ow would a pint go now, Skinny?”
SKINNY: “ 'Ere, chuck it! That ain't humor
it’s triplin' with a bloke's affeeshuns."
We worked and sang —and the Lord lcnoivs
best-
Oh, those dear old homes of the fairy West!
By tracks that ran ’neath the granite ridges
The children played on their way from
school —-
By the fairy dells and the sapling bridges,
And stole a swim in the willowed pool.
And home they flocked with their ceaseless
chatter,
Till, happy and tired, and washed and
fed—•
(The wash came after —it doesn't matter)
They said their prayers and they went to
bed.
We worked and dreamed —and the Lord
knows best —
Oh, those dear old tvuys of the fairy West!
We rose at daylight, refreshed and hearty,
And drank our tea while the children
slept;
We worked with the jest of a camping-
party,
While the morning breeze through the
gum-trees crept.
We worked till the signal of “Breakfast
ready!”
And ate our fill of the good land’s best;
And Jimmy and Mary, and Nell and Teddy,
And all the children were washed and
dressed.
Oh, those grand old farms of pleasure and
rest
In the fairy tales of the Golden West!
’Twas a land overflowing with milk and
honey,
And eggs and bacon and butter and beer.
We came to Sydney, with whips of money,
To see the wbrld about twice a year.
The girls got married to rich young farmers,
And did no work save to populate ;
And we had the pick of the city charmers
And took our brides to the country
straight.
We dreamed and sang—and the Lord knows
best —•
Oh, those dear old dreams of the fairy West!
11.
I dreamed last night of those days long
vanished,
And buried in bitterness out of sight;
The scene was gone and the folk were
banished,
And this is the picture I saw last night—
It may be false and it may be real;
It may be wrong and it may be right—
A sort of set-off to the grand ideal:
We’ll call it “A Vision of Sandy Blight.”
We dreamed and sang—and you know the
rest—
The Sandy Blight in the Wondrous West.
The daylight comes to the skillion “winder,’
A hole with never a breath of air;
And never a pane of glass to hinder
The reek from the pig-sty adjacent there.
The skillion cowers in the daybreak ghostly.
Criminal-like, as skillions do;
It is fashioned of bark and bagging mostly—
And furnished with bark and bagging, too.
Swiftly—too swiftly-—the light comes creep-
ing
Round the corners, cobweb-immeshed,
To the dusty “bunk” where “the boys” lie
sleeping,
Gummy-eyed, dirty and unrefreshed.
Huddled like monkeys ( I’m tired of coining
Rhyme to brighten this cheerful lay)
A bang on the slabs of the room adjoining:
“Git up! Are yer gaunter lay there all
day?”
Three hides of bones in the yard are bailed up
(We called ’em “k’yows” when my heart
was young),
A pitiful calling where calves are railed up,
A stifling cloud from the pow r dered dung.
A dusty and sleepy head is boring
Into the flank of each dusty cow—
Milk, dust and burrs in the buckets pouring;
Three skinny youngsters are milkin’ now.
And rainy weather! I would be plainer—
The filthy tail and the plunging hoof!
(The worst came out in the home-made
“strainer,”
But more came down from
the “dairy” roof.)
Seven cows each, and the
calves are “poddied.”
The pigs are fed while the
boys can creep ;
They’ve done the work of the
able-bodied,
And one sits down in the
dust to sleep.
The skimmin’, and scaldin’
(in loo’-warm water,
And cloudy at that) and
the churnin’ done.
The hopeless face of the elder
daughter
The narrowed mind of the
elder son.
The sulky scowl of the
younger brother,
The morning greeting of
“you’re a fool!”
The rasping voice of the
worn-out mother:
“Now git yer breakfus’ an’
git ter school!”
Three miles to the school-
house^ —and often more
in . *
The sparser districts (it
makes me sick) —-
“Mountins and rivers” and
“parsin’” and “drorin’ ”
Readin’ and writin’ and
’rithmetic,
Sewin’ an’ singin’ and “ob-
jiek lessins,”
Spellin’, dicktashin’, “home
lessins” too !
A bit of “relegin” for all
these “blessin’s,”
And home in a hurry to
milk the Coo.
We slaved and sang—and the Lord knows
best —-
Oh, those dear old homes of the fairy West!
n.s.w. Henry Lawson.
P.S. : I was in “Yewklid” the day I finished
Me edyercashun in those times dim—
My younger brother cleared out to Queens-
land ;
’Twas “Mountins and Rivers” that finished
him.

Honor Among Thieves.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WHEN I went on duty at 6.30 p.m.
that night I had no more idea that
I would be an embezzler before day-
light than I had of soaring over the rain-
swept landscape on a broomstick. Yet early
next morning, after five seconds delibera-
tion, I embezzled £l6B. Night shift at
Torangihape was a dreary business. There
was nothing to do but signal a few stock
trains through at irregular intervals, take
telegrams to be transmitted to the branch by
telephone, and keep the station monthly
returns posted up. Of course, sometimes a
fellow could get company, but not on a night
like this, when a 60-mile-an-hour gale was
sweeping the country, and driving sheets of
water through every opening. The gas jets
guttered and hissed till it was impossible to
read by them, so I made myself comfortable
before the big fireplace and dozed off to sleep.
I have never been quite able to remember
that dream, but I know it was glorious—a
soft afternoon in a seaside land where the
scent of apples was wafted about on a wind
that just moved the fronds of the palm trees.
Some girls were approaching with
A harsh, grating sound broke through the
music of their singing, and I awoke to find a
man in a big overcoat shaking me by the
shoulder, and saying something about “Wake
up, man, wake up!”
It was Finch, of the Post Office, and won-
dering how I had come to go to sleep with
the door unlocked I demanded to know what
he was doing out at such an hour on such a
night.
Finch made no coherent reply. Instead,
he waved his arms like semaphores out of
smooth wofking order, and made a strange
noise like a blithered ghost or a chop frying
in the distance.
“Cut out the drama, Finch, and explain
why you are acting the angora?”
“I’m ruined—ruined!” he complained dis-
mally.
“You will be in a moment if you make
such an infernal row. Do you want the
police to come round to see who’s being
killed, you galoot? What’s ruined you, any-
how?”
“Shares,” he said in a voice akin to the
bitterness of death. “Alhambra Options !”
“Alhambra Options! That’s Robison’s
show, isn’t it?”
. “Yes. The unburied hound told me they’d
rise 120 per cent, inside the week, and I be-
lieved him. I lifted £l6B from the Savings
Bank and bought shares with it at 10s.
They’ve dropped to Bs. 4d., and King, the
auditor, his way from Goldfield. He
may be here any moment. He’s driving, and
he’s just as likely to drive all night as not.
He’s most eccentric.”
“Well, Finch, you're a blithering idiot, if
ever there was one. You fellows make me
that disgusted I want to kick, and kick
hard.”
“Oh, what shall I do; what shall I do?
It’s gaol for certain for myself, and starva-
tion for the wife and kiddies. My God, tell
me what I shall do?”
This flood of hysteria had to be blocked
somehow.
“Don’t call me your God—l wouldn’t be
your blessed god for all the meat in China,
old man.” I said flippantly.
He calmed at once. He gripped the back
or the chair with his hands, and steadying
himself he stared hard at me a moment and
said, hardly above a whisper :
“Will you save me? It is in your power
to do it. Will you do it?”
“Wrong, Finch ! I have a few pounds, but
not £l6B. Inside two days I should receive
about £2OO in dividends from the Alhambra
Consolidated. To-morrow I’ll get an ad-
vance against that and fix you up.”
“To-morrow after 8.45 a.m. will be too
late. I tell you King will be here with the
light. The moment the office is open he will
take charge. Give me the money to-night,
lou deposited £l9B three days ago. Draw
£l6B of that and. save me !”
“It isn’t mine. That’s part of the Union's
fund. It is deposited in the names of indivi-
duals so that injunctions cannot be obtained.
I may be called on to pay over at any
moment. I’ll get you an advance against
my dividend. King won’t be travelling on
such a night as this —it’s absurd to think of
it.”
“I tell you if the money is not there at
8.45 a.m. it’s not worth worrying about. The
postmaster will have found out about it even
if King isn’t there. You know how nervous
they get when they know an auditor is on
the track.”
And I did. Unless the money was there
before either auditor or postmaster arrived
Finch was doomed. It wasn’t much to me
but it seemed a heap to Finch.
My mind went wandering across the tree-
lined street to the little cottage behind the
laburnum trees, and I saw a vision of the
two curly-liaired little boys on the grass. I
had neither chick nor child. I began to
sway. If I fell dead to-morrow there was
none save my tailor to lament me. And a
tailor is only the ninth part of a man in any
case, and can only give the ninth part of a
lamentation. With a sudden plunge I deter-
mined to do it.
If I live to be a thousand I shall never
forget that dingy, draughty post-office with
its guttering gas-flare. I shivered as I took
the various forms in my hands and signed,
and signed, and signed myself a dishonorable
man—a thief, in fact, stealing to shelter an-
other thief. Then Finch put the date stamp
HOW SHOULD THE MAN KNOW?
“ Hi, Mister, your horse is boltin' .”
on all the forms and I had gone too far to
draw back.
Finch became a changed man. * He drew
from a cupboard a; bottle of the favorite
whisky of the day, accompanied me back to
the railway office, and started to brew punch.
He kept on brewing it till the last stock
train was clear of the section and the inside
of the bottle was as dry as the outside. He
begged me to come over and have a chop
with him, but I declined; so he insisted on
taking me home and assuring me 91 times
that all fears of an indigent old age were
over while he and his remained alive to work
for me.
I went wearily to bed. and tossed about,
haunted by half-waking dreams. Suppose
something should go wrong with Alhambra
Consolidated, and, after all, it did not pay
that promised dividend —where would I be
then? The div. was announced in the papers
but not formally declared. Another tiling,
recollected that neither Finch nor 1 1 ■ 1,1
a word about repayment; but surely he -
sell at the earliest possible moment ant ''.
things square. Then I must have dozed orc,
for I had a vision in which I was a^ a '.
by somebody coming into the room and n »
ing a rosy flush with him. It w'hs >- <
manager of the Alhambra Consolidated , c
in a few minutes I found my worst tears
realised. The South Pacific had burst
through the floor of the mine, and the tin
dend would be held back. Then I woke ng
up with something between a yell and a cuise.
Read looked at me woodenly for half a seconc
and then trembled and faded right out wi
a burst of flames, surrounded by a grey mis
The room was glowing with the rosy, flush o
dawn, and I went downstairs and cajoled tne
rouseabout into giving me two brandies,
mixed a dash of absinthe with the last, cooled
it with ice, and made it fizzy with sodawhtei.
Then I went back to bed. r
At 10.30 a.m. came Lottie with hot tea
and a message that Dan Palmer, the coach
agent, wanted to see me “most perticler .
“Send him Up, and tell him to bring the
bottle with him, Lottie, and also the ingre-
dients.’’ . , , . , ; ,
Lottie said she Would and vanished, and in
about three minutes Dan Palmer stood smil-
ing at the door, bearing a tray, oil which
stood a bottle, a glass of crushed ice and a
syphon.
Dan was a character or a fiend or some-
thing. He was the agent for a service of
coaches which linked up the inland towns
with our end of the railway. He was up to
the neck in mining, and was popularly whis-
pered to be worth anything up to £150.000.
He might really be worth nothing, but the
halo and rumor of wealth were around him,
He it was who had put me on to Alhambra
Consolidateds when they Were begging, be-
cause I had happened to be standing by when
he fell betweeh the carriage and the platform,
and very haturally hauled him put as I would
have any other animal. But he was ridicu-
lously grateful, and was always making mb
valuable presents, or donations 01 scrip which
was going to be valuable.
This was the man who now stood at the
door with the tray, smiling at me with little,
rat-bright eyes set in the midst of a wilder-
ness of ridged and crinkled countenance.
“Ha ah, my boy ! What were, you up to
last night to want a brandy and soda first
thing this morning. I thought .you were
Working. Went over several times, but-
heard Finch in there, so came away.”
I poured out the liquid and drank it
quickly. . ...
“What’s the excitement, Dan? More El-
dorados?” . .
“Yes, and a real hummer, too ! It’s Al-
hambra Options. Get the manager of the
Bank of Polynesia to advance you every
bean you can on the Consolidated shares and
against that dividend that’s payable to-mor-
row, an’ plunge for your life. They’re down
to Bs. Day after to-morrow they’ll be any-
thing over 355. I’m doin’ ’zactly what I’m
telling you to do.”
“Well. I’ll think about it. Many thanks,
Dan, old man !”
“There’s no time to think about it, lad;
what’s going to be done must be done right
away. That blithering idiot Finch rushed
down to Bailey the broker an’ give him £lBO
in hard cash, notes and some postal notes, to
buy all he could at the price. I’ve got first
call on Bailey’s stock, but must buy or re-
lease when someone else comes along.
Wouldn’t have mattered, only Finch bein’ a
telegraph bloke the wise ones will bet he’s
working on a leak in someone’s code—which,
no doubt, he is.”
I got out of bed with a roar. Dan gaped
at me in surprise.
“The swindling thief!” I bellowed. “He
borrowed £l6B of that from me last night!”
“Ah, an’ told you he’d been ‘dipping’?”
“Yes!”
“’Zac’ly what he told me, an’ I give him
twelve pun to send his wife an’ kids to her
people with. He’s wise, lad ; lie's wise. We
must look very slippy.”
“What about?”


“To set them shares for you.’
“It’s no good, Dan. ; I’m blotted out.
F A C n h d h t a hen°l ToVhSn 3 the whole story, and
when I had finished he leaned back and
lau£rli6cl, rumblinglj. . .
uj don’t see where the joke comes in,
D^Y? ou will if you look slippy. Them there
shares Finch is aftenis under option to me
t ill 30 We’ll see Russell, get ther money,
get ther’shares, an’ then you demand your
and receiving are somewhat
different. I can’t prosecute, as I gave him
the money to conceal a felony, in the first
case In the second case I am just
hopeless, because I gave him stolen money.
Ran did another shriek of mirth and
dragged me along.
Twenty minutes later we emerged from
Russell’s office (Russell managed the Bank
of. Polynesia). Inside my coat pocket re-
nosed a large packet of notes, and we star! ed
at a run for Bailey’s little green and white
business premises at the corner. Bailey
glanced at the clock.
“You’re just on time, Palmer. _ h oui
minutes to spare only. How many is your
friend taking?”
“A thousand!”
“Can’t deliver more than 750—will do
my best through the day.” „
“Right. Balance at the same price only.
“Right.” , , ,
As we strolled down the street towards
Palmer’s place we saw Finch galloping
towards Bailey’s office. I drew Palmer b
attention to the fact. Palmer exploded with
wrath. , , , 1 tt
“That thieving broker s robbed us. Me
had more than 750. He’s raised the price
on Finch and done trade with him. All
right! Just wait!”
And he ground his teeth.
Then he lead the way through the office
to the dining-room, where I found breakfast
waiting.
Half an hour later we were back in the
office, and having got rid of the freckled
youth who kept watch and ward in his ab-
sence Dan said softly :
“What was the amount of that money
you received for the Union, and what date
did you receive it?”
“It was £l9B, and I received it four days
ago. But Finch has £l6B of it now.”
Dan picked up a small bottle containing
some black fluid, and after examining it
carefully, abstracted a form from a book
and wrote on it laboriously. Then he changed
the office date stamp, and stamped the form
with a heavy grunt; after which he waved
it in the air till it was dry.
“Now that fixes your Union money, lad!
he said, handing over the document and pro-
ceeding to fill in the butt of his book. I
looked at the slip and found it was his firm’s
receipt for £l9B of the Union’s good money
handed to him for safe keeping in the big
strong room under the house.
“But, Dan, suppose they overhaul your
strong l'oom suddenly, while the money’s
in Alhambra Options?”
“Then it’ll be there; that’s all.”
“It’s awfully good of”
“Shut up. We’ll just settle our breakfast
an’ then you go along an’ talk Dutch to
little Tommy Finch. My aunt, how will he
squirm ! The dawg !”
Finch was jaunty. He lit a cigarette and
smiled affably.
“We’re going to make a lot of money out of
this, old chappie. I’m afraid I played it
rather low down on you; but, you know, I
might never have another chance to get rich
in 48 hours. Let’s go across!”
A NASTY ONE.
“I saw your husband at the theatre last night
with such a nice looking girl, and he said
the funniest thing in the world to me. He
said, 'Remember, you haven't seen me to-
night. Now, whatever did he mean?”
“Yes, I want to talk seriously to you. And,
first, I want my money back.”
“You’ll have it —and interest, too, in an-
other 72 hours.”
“I want it now .”
“Talk sense —or I’ll have to ; and I don’t
want to.”
“I’d like to hear you?’
“Well, I don’t want to remind you that
the money you lent me is the property of
the Railway Officers’ Union. I have never
borrowed so much as a thrum from the till.
My books prove conclusively that I never
required ‘saving.’ However, don’t let us
get on to that subject. It’ll all be over in
72 hours, and we’ll both be rich. You had
enough to buy 750 shares this morning. I
had to pay 10s. for mine on account of that
early call of yours.”
“So you decline to refund me my money? ’
t “I regret I cannot give you back the
Union funds for about 72 hours.”
“It was not Union money —it was my
own. The Union money is lying safely in
Dan Palmer’s strong room.”
“You’re a liar!”
“Go and ask him!”
“Very well! Lead the way !”
I led the way. Dan was in his chair
smoking a cigar like a bowsprit. He pointed
to chairs :
“Still threshing it out, eh?” he said
peacefully. “You’re a dawg, Tommy Finch !”
Finch sprang up.
“You call me that! You call me that!
You ! You! YOU !”
“Don’t make a noise, Tommy. What can
I do for you, anyhow?”
THE POINT OF VIEW.
HE (from the country): "A beautiful rain this , eh?”
HIM (from the city): “Yes, it'll make a wonderful difference to our golf links!"

So I wasn’t an embezzler, and Pinch s
hold on me was gone. And Finch was a com-
mon debtor, and by his own statement to
me and Palmer he was an embezzler also.
He went out of the door backwards, _ with a
sort of howl. I felt so sorry for him that
when we met that night we made it up.

Did time ever go so slowly? Did ever
mining news dribble through so sparingly l
Columns of dull details and instructions to
and from brokers and agents went clattering
through, most of it in cypher; but no word
of a great and phenomenal strike in Alham-
bra Options ; and no word of the shares ot
that mysterious concern moving upward.
The Alhambra Consolidated dividend came
along and went into the Bank of Polynesia
to pay my debt. Robison, chief panjan-
drum of the Options, passed through on his
way to the mine, leaving an order for a
private carriage on the afternoon express
two days later. Finch got over his shock
and went back to work; but every day saw
him growing greyer with the hope too long
deferred. He used to wander over to the
railway and gaze towards the distant violet
hills behind which lay the two mines, with a
gaunt face and black-ringed eyes. A pathetic
picture. . T vj
To keep up my own drooping spirits 1 did
my best to exalt his tail. And, somehow, lie
seemed to get comfort in my society. The
night Robison was to catch the express
Finch was called away by wire to relieve an
operator who had broken his leg —0 miles
EiWciy*
It was a sombre day. Clouds hung along
the hilltops, and muttering thunder made an
eerie atmosphere. No rain fell, and there
was a stillness that might be felt. The ex-
press, delayed for a mail steamerwas an
hour late, and the lamps were burning when
it came roaring out from between the giant
hawthorns, across the long wooden viaduct.
As it passed the home signal I was aston-
ished to see Mrs. Finch and the children,
beautifully dressed, walk down the plat-
form, followed by porter Egley laden with
luggage. The lady bowed as she went by.
Next came Robison to inquire about his re-
served carriage.
“Second carriage from the luggage-van,
Mr. Robison. A ‘smoker,’ which I presume
you wanted!”
“Quite right! Ah. here we are.
Porter Egley unlocked the door, and then,
to my amazement, piled Mrs. Finch’s mass of
luggage into the reserved car. I was about
to interfere when I saw a sovereign flash
neatly from Robison’s finger and thumb to
Egley’s palm. I walked down the platform,
took one last look at the Block, and gave the
starting signal. The guard’s whistle blew,
and the express moved out.
I waited a moment to ask porter Egley it
he had been told to put the luggage in the
reserved car ; but Egley had disappeared, bo
I walked into the office and, to my amaze-
ment, found Finch sitting disconsolately at
the fire.
“I thought you were at Wangaihape:
“No, it was a practical joke. _ Same fellow
brought me back, with apologies for being
‘the innocent instrument’ and so forth. When
are you going to have tea? My wife s out
and I’m hungry.” .
“We’ll go now!” I said, as the Block bell
announced the train’s arrival at the next sta-
tion, and the cadet walked in. And I hur-
ried Finch away before Egley could enter
and blurt things out. What need to blurt
when half the people on the platform had
seen Mrs. Finch entering a carriage marked
“Reserved” with Robison? So to tea we
went.
The table looked at Finch in amazement,
and a sudden hush fell, broken only by the
hysterical laugh of a jackass at the far end.
Big Somers dropped a heavy list on his shoul-
der with a hiss, and the laugh died in the
jackass’s neck somewhere. Then Somers
went out, taking the jackass with him, so we
were one ass short. Hardly was he out be-
fore he put his head inside again and said a
lame Jew wanted to see me, privately. I
went forth. Somers gripped me by the arm.
“Is he wise?”
“Not yet!”
“Don’t tell him till after dinner; then
bring him to my sitting-room.”
* # * *
It was a nice dinner, but I never enjoyed
one less. Immediately afterwards I led the
way to Somers’s sitting-room, and found the
giant waiting. He pushed chairs into posi-
tion and said sepulclirally :
“It’s a rotten black day!
Dan Palmer’s done a bunk with
everybody’s money. Robison’s
done a bunk with everybody
else’s money. All the gold won
the last month or so out of
Alhambra Options has done a
bunk, like' the manager. For a
week the water’s been pouring
into the mine, but it only leaked
out when it burst into the Con-
solidated this afternoon and
drowned the poor chaps in the
bottom-level. By the way,
Finch, is Robison a friend of
yours?”
Finch was staring at me with
glassy eyes and never heard
the question. Then he sud-
denly burst into a laugh.
“Go on, Somers. Any more
news?”
“Well, that depends. Is Rob-
ison a friend of yours?”
“Not in any way. He is a
distant relative of the wife’s, and comes to
see her and the kiddies occasionally. _ Last
time he came he ran me into this infernal
hole of his. Why do you ask?”
“What time did you get into the office to-
night, Finch?” I suddenly interrupted.
“Just as the express pulled up. I saw you
speaking to Robison, and as I didn’t want to
see him I went in and sat down. Why?”
“Because I was wondering if you knew
Mrs. Finch and the children went away by
the express?”
Finch turned round and stared in blank
amazement. Then he pulled himself together.
“I’m afraid,” he said, “we’re all a little bit
unstrung to-day. Probably you’ve made a
mistake.”
“It is no mistake,” said Somers. I and a
dozen others saw them.”
“Be kind enough to come down to the
house with me, you chaps!” he said shakily,
rising to his feet and trembling like a leaf.
Then he changed his mind and declared he
would go alone. He would not have anyone
with him. We made him promise to come
back if things were not right.
We waited an hour, and then I had to go
to the office. Somers strolled down with me.
In the windows of Finch’s home the lights
gleamed warmly. At the office I found the
office door wide open and the cadet invisible.
I hunted him up, but was too dispirited to
say more than that I hoped he had not left
the office door open while talking to the fas-
cinating waitress in the refreshment-room.
He muttered something sheepishly, and then
took his departure. Somers and I sat before
the tire smoking. Outside a boy exploded a
cracker. . ...
Suddenly Egley rushed in in a wild state
of excitement and announced that the post
office was on fire and Finch had shot himself.
We bounded out and found it was true.
The post office was doomed. It had burst in-
to flame as though it had been flooded with
kerosene. When the alarm was given the
sergeant found Finch looking at the blaze,
and asked how it occurred.
“Excuse me a moment,” said I inch turn-
ing away and lowering his head as though he
was about to take a surreptitious bite at
something. Then there was a report, and
before the sergeant realised what had hap-
pened Finch had fallen forward. When the
officer picked him up it suddenly struck him
it was a case of suicide.
The office burned furiously, and long before
the antiquated hand-pumping contraption
could be got to work it was a smouldering
mass of embers, with a miserable make-
believe safe in the middle of it vomiting
small sparks.
Somers went for whisky and I rushed back
to take the signals of the last train. I was
just about to throw up the ticket window to
book the passengers that were not waiting
when I found a brown official envelope ad-
dressed to myself on the inside ledge. I tore
it open and drew forth four £2O notes and a
jumbled mass of fivers and ones, totalling
£l9O altogether.
I shoved them hastily into the back of the
till as Somers came tripping down the plat-
form ; and then I drank, mentally, to the
repose of the soul of Finch. He was, at
least, an honorable thief. Probably he had
repaid me with stolen money, but at least
I was repaid.
Among his effects in his house was found
a letter to me, unfinished, in which he ex-
plained that Dan Palmer had incited him
to borrow from me on the plea he had been
“dipping,” and to invest the money in Alham-
bra Options. He had found out it was
Palmer’s shares that we had both bought.
When Palmer’s partners broke into the
strong-room it contained nothing that could
be turned into cash. Dan had made a clean
sweep. Even the £l9O which I had not
deposited was not there, but a cash-box with
my name on it, about which I knew nothing,
was. Dess than a week later his partners
sent along a cheque for the amount pinned
to a receipt discharging them of all lia-
bilities whatsoever. I didn’t know what to
do about it.
My trouble was that if I started to ex-
plain I would have to explain everything —
a thing I'could not afford to do. I did the
next best thing.. I called on them, and ad-
mitted that though I had a legal claim on
them, my moral right to the money was very
shadowy. If they were pressed, half of it
would do now and the rest could stand over
till more convenient.
The elder of the partners smiled grimly.
He said it was kind of me to call and ex-
press those sentiments, but he rather guessed
his firm could stand the loss better than me
or the union. Anyhow, it was a legal lia-
bility, and had to be met.
He regretted, he said, that Dan Palmer,
among all his big steals, had come down to
small amounts like this.
So Dan’s partners renaid me the money
I stole. And Finch repaid it also out of..the
cash he embezzled before he burned the post-
office and committed suicide. Thus I was a
small fortune to the good—or would have
been if I hadn’t borrowed from the Bank of
Polynesia to buy Dan’s dead and gone scrip.
BUSH LIFE.
( Being a suggestion for foreign writers in search
of local color for their next Australian novel.)
Whilst hunting, blackboys are often “ sucked
in ” by carpet snakes, and are only extracted
with much strenuous exertion.
And Finch was a tombstone to the good.
As the books and the safe were destroyed
he took his unblemished character away with
And as for Palmer and Xobison and Mrs.
Finch and the children, Aey were never
heard of again in these parts. So I can t tell
how much they were to the good.

The Prize Poem.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE editor of the Codfish News was a
large size autocrat,
With a two-inch brain in a swollen
skull that called for a giant’s hat.
And he said: "This paper circulates through
Jeetho and Poowong.
Through Geurie, Bena and Trafalgar, Din-
woodie and Narbethong.
And as I am the mentor of these and many
another place,
And when I speak they hold their breath
and Drouin hides its face,
■^ nc * „P ll kl>o whispers of its prayers, and
Blayney’s hope beats high,
Tis tit that I offer a hand to Art, for verily
I am I.
I’ll offer a first prize of one pound, and if
but the winner choose
He shall take instead a two years’ file of
my work in the Codfish News,
That circulates widely in Mudgee shire
through Jeetho and Poowong,
Through Geurie, Bena and Trafalgar, Din-
woodie and Narbethong.
The prize shall be to the poet who brings
the poem finest wrought
Of the high desire and the good intent and
the words of the godlike thought.
He shall praise the British Umpire, he shall
say a good word for all,
He shall rail at the Labor party, he shall
make the bush voices call.
Romance he shall have —heart interest, and
love and the moonlight sheen,
And at least once in his poem he shall say
‘‘God save the Queen.”
But the greatest of all conditions, his poem
must never pall,
The treatment must be entirely new and
the verse quite original.
And lastly, if the prize he’d win, if the
sovereign he would not lose,
He must end his verse with a prayer to
God and with praise to the Codfish
News,
That circulates widely in Mudgee shire,
through Jeetho and Poowong,
Through Geurie, Bena and Trafalgar, Din-
woodie and Narbethong.”
I sent in my poem to win that quid, alas
and alack a day !
There is roguery in all the games but the
game that is played my way.
Though I wrote with the tongues of angels
and men till the High Gods stooped to
list
With Dante’s beauty and Shakspeare’s
strength and the force of an anarchist,
They gave the prize to a cow from ’Ome
whose verse no wrongs excuse—
The cow who wrote the “original” stuff de-
sired by the Codfish News,
That circulates widely in Mudgee shire,
through Jeetho and Narbethong
Through Geurie and Bena and Trafalgar,
Dinwoodie and Narbethong.

me to be glad to lose—

The Death of a Fat Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
is probably the last thing I shall
ever write, because, immediately I
have finished it, I am going out to kill
a certain loathly fat man; and, immediately
after the massacre, which will be performed
with a saw and hatchet for spectacular effect,
I intend to go and spring my confession on
the first stupid-looking policeman I find doz-
ing on a street corner. So that he may be
convinced at once, and not keep me arguing
in the sun, I shall take some evidence of the
crime with me in a bag, and, at the critical
moment, thrust it into his hands. He will
probably scream and jump backwards with
the shock of it; but at this stage I cannot
stop to consider the feelings of policemen.
They are large, cheap men whose business it
is to be shocked by studies of classical nudes,
murders and so forth.
Well, this fat man that I am going to kill
is a time-payment collector. He exudes
grease and apologies, and has large, damp
hands, and a ripe, overhanging nose, and a
maddening way of saying /'That'll be all
right!” I acquired him like a disease a
year ago, through buying some inferior furni-
ture on the time-payment system. Next
week I found him writhing like a scalded
octopus on the mat, and he was all grease
and apologies, and it was a fine day, and he
had called for the weekly instalment of one
pound (yes, thanks!), and would that day be
convenient for me? Because, if so, he would
always come and perspire at me on that day,
thanks so much, a.nd it was no trouble at all.
I got rid of him by giving him a sover-
eign which I couldn’t spare, and, by way of
return, he wrote something illegible in a
small book which he gave back to me with
some valueless remarks about the weather.
Then he raised his hat (I hate people to
raise their hats to me as if I were a woman
or a funeral), and I saw that he was per-
spiring on top of his head as well as on his
face and neck. After replacing his hat,
which was a rotten, shapeless thing, and not
worth it, he turned and waddled away, apolo-
gising over his shoulder for his unseemly
haste, which was purely imaginary. I
slammed the door and looked to see what he
had written in the first square. And when
I saw it was ‘‘2o/ —G.8.C.,” and noticed
7o squares just like it, and realised that he
would call 75 more times and perspire at me,
unless he was murdered or paid off, I howled
like a stricken wolf and had a sort of fit.
He duly came back next week, and I
realised with a feeling of terror that he re-
garded me as more of a friend than a credi-
tor. He confided to me that some of his
other clients (splendid souls!) were rude to
him and spurned him from their doors. He
gave me to understand that calling on me
was a perfect delight to him, because I (God
help me!) was a gentleman and knew how
to treat a perspirer. In his own wormish
way he was mad with the people who spurned
him, and he confided to me as one worm to
another—which may have been right, but it
made me as mad as a snake, though he never
suspected it. He then told me, perspiring
more freely than ever, that he belonged to the
United Grand Order of Something-or-Other
and recounted the social and financial bene-
fits that would descend on me if I would
delight him by joining their ranks. I told
him as coldly as I could that I never joined
anything or went anywhere—in fact, that I
was as one dead, in so far as social life was
concerned. That didn’t discourage him. He
urged me, as one perspirer to another, to
reform my life habits and join, pointing out
that I would thereby be aiding the Vegetarian
Mission for the Conversion of South Sea
Cannibals, which was mysteriously affiliated
with the United Grands. He begged me
with tears in his eyes and liquid grease on
his countenance to reconsider my decision; he
also pawed my shoulder ivith one of his fat,
perspiring hands, and thereby prevented me
from striking him, which I would have done
in another minute. After that he. squirmed
apologetically and mentioned “that little mat-
ter of a pound,” and I weak-mindedly gave
him the amount, instead of courageously
kicking him in the stomach, as I should have
done. When he finally wobbled away with
my good money, I slammed the door and
asked myself in a loud voice why I should be
afflicted with this human gas-box or hot jelly-
fish? Why should he be entitled to come and
perspire at me when I merely owed his firm
money? I determined to get rid of him tem-
porarily by destroying his pretence for call-
ing. I wrote a short letter to his firm, en-
closing three borrowed sovereigns for three
weeks’ instalments, and adding that I would
be out of town for that period and to instruct
their collector not to call.
YV hen the three weeks were up I escaped
him for another fortnight by leaving the
money with the wife. But on the third trip'
he caught me. I heard a ring (it was
exactly like the ring of a human being) and
incautiously answered the door myself.
When his greasy eyes lit on me, 'he per-
formed'like one of those heavily upholstered
spaniels when it has regained the house after
a penitential spell in the yard. In his trans-
ports he tried to paw me ; but I avoided him.
Then he took off his hat to show me how
much his head was perspiring and wagged
himself (I can’t express it any other way)
on the mat. I thrust the week’s ransom at
him, and he. purposely lingered over the
receipt—signing while he edged in a few
words about the lodge or branch or kennel he
belonged to, and what a fine lot of perspirers
were in it. He said that they were shortly
giving a grand concert in aid of the
Cannibals, and lie wanted me to go
and hear them eating the missionary.
He himself was going to play the
flute, though of course he did it very badly
and wouldn’t think of doing it only they
were a bit short of talent. He then said he
would give me a few tickets to sell to my
friends—and, by thunder, he did! —shoved
the pestiferous things into my hand and jelly-
fished out the gate before I had time to
think. When he had escaped, and it was too
late to do anything, I knew exactly ivhat I
should have done. I should have kicked him
in the stomach.
T think it was during his twenty-fifth visi-
tation that I tried to brain or seriously dis-
able him with a heavy flowerpot, which I
pushed over the edge of the balcony with a
walking-stick while he was standing at the
hall entrance. Not only did I miss him,
but he meanly took advantage of my attempt
on his life by slowly picking up the pieces
and talking all the time about the United
Brands. I must have been dazed by my
failure to assassinate him, because, when I
came to, he was shaking me by the hand,
perspiring faster than ever, and calling me
Brother”! _ Before I could escape, he had
given me 75 more tickets for the alleged
grand concert, and had taken my order for a
tul l set of regalia, including cocked hat with
ostrich feathers and nickel-plated battle-axe
and side arms. As I fled I heard him crying
aloud. that I would be the very gaudiest spec-
tacle in the whole lodge, or stodge, or some-
thing.
But that day sealed his doom. From that
time onward I allowed the human octopus to
envelop and absorb me, knowing that, the
further he took me into his system, the worse
1 would be able to sting him when the time
came. I wore the regalia of a United Grand,
learnt the ritual, and, finally, under his
greasy chaperonage, I became a full United
Grand. Then all the other United Grands
crowded round and shook me by the hand,
saying they were glad to welcome a new
brother, and that my ostrich feathers and
battle-axe looked fine. And all the time the
doomed, perspiring jelly-fish stood by and
waved his time-payment tentacles, as if he
hacL alone and unaided, brought home some
rare and expensive animal. Going to and

fro with him on lodge foolery, I got number-
less opportunities to push him under trains
and over bridges; but I resisted my natural
impulse to get rid of him; I even got some
peculiar and awful joy out of luring him to
dangerous spots, and then refraining from
doing the obvious thing. He was very near
to his end, though, the day he called me
“Brother’ on the edge of the South Head
cliffs. 1 nursed and humored him carefully
right up to yesterday; but yesterday he came
with his face greased with delight and told
me that he had prevailed on the wife to get
a £5O sideboard, so he would be calling regu-
larly for at least another year, dear Brother.
That instant I decided he must die to-day.
I realised that I had had enough of my per-
spiring octopus and might betray myself at
any moment.
It will not be a quiet but pretty murder.
If I may say so, it will be a loud and garish
display such as my friend, the boiled devil-
fish. deserves. The United Grands will
probably be scandalised, and the cocked hat
with the ostrich feathers, the battle-axe and
the side arms will have to be written off as
a dead loss. But a certain amount of ruin
and desolation is inseparable from such pro-
ceedings as are now at hand. With these
few words, I gather up my hatchet and my
saw and depart. The first howls will prob-
ably break out in about eight minutes

CONSIDERATION OF
CRAYFISH
For the "Bulletin."
Here in the morning languid, fair,
’Tis good to lie beneath a tree —
A careless tree, whose uncombed hair
Is winnowed by the warm, sweet air
That blows across a lazy sea.
Last evening with a scarlet cray
I held soft converse in the shade,
And watched the lustrous bubbles play
On liquids indolently gay,
! For which a kindly friendship paid.
The cray had much to say and sing
Of various matters secret, sweet.
The claw he waved was like the wing
Of old Regret when new Joys fling
Their purple pleasures at my feet.
He told of other pleasant nights
More wet than this, though not so calm,
When, robed like ballet girls in tights,
A hundred thousand sweet delights
Died to a Bacchanalian psalm.
He sang of midnights chaste and pale
Beneath large moons serene and cold.
When little wavelets heard the tale
Of popping corks and amber ale,
And life was full .as it might hold^^
Of various dreams that passed away
When the large morning smote the scenes
Of revel, and our thirst, grown grey,
Stared blankly in the light of day
At serried ranks of dead marines. i
He was a doleful beast 1 and
The cray, whose murmur q
Seemed like a slice of Hope goneHodd,
While lounging on a blotting-pad
Some bright, fair chequelet lingered late. ;
He burdened me with heavy care,
But here beneath this careless tree,
Whose depth of shady uncombed hair
' Is winnowed by the warm, sweet air,
} think no more of such as he.
The sobbing ocean wanders round
By sandy cove and rocky bay,
And in its cool green depths are found,
Each making sad and mournful sound,
Innumerable claws of Cray.
The constant sorrow of the sea
Explains the joy 1 find on land,
For here beneath this lazy tree
The morning girl upon my knee
Draws corks with an unerring hand.

1 don’t know what it's all about, and still
He will keep wasting time upon his rot.
He says, “The linendrapers boil our pot”
When I remind him of an unpaid bill.
Pacing the room with glances fit to kill,
He swears that every tradesman should be
shot.
Poor fool —he’s mad. And what am I to do?
I’ll have to leave him in the end, I know;
I just can't stand him longer, that is flat.
I tell him so —he says he hopes it’s true —
There won’t be so much chatter if I go.
Just think of it. Now, hasn't he a rat?
His Homecoming.
It’s tea-time, and the children all in bed.
I filled the vases, carelessly (his way)
Then set the table (Jane’s day off to-day).
“I’ll be home sharp at six to-night,” he said.
“I ought to work, but I’ll come home
instead.
Say, missus, but, by Jove, you’re getting
grey—
You don’t look well —I’ll take you to the
play!”—■
Borrowed my last half-crown, and off he
fled.
Six comes and goes—find seven passes, too.
Was that ten struck? It was, upon my life.
Then midnight passes.... Hark, was that a
cab?
Ugh, here he comes—quite drunk, and with
a crew
Of motley deadbeats.... “Come, chaps, meet
the wife !
Say, girlie (hie), we’ve brought you home a
crab!”
My Lover.
A pirate ship.... Storm-driven clouds that
race
Across the moon-red, reeking red....the
crash
Of mighty thunders.... then the lightning
flash
That shows him to me. Haughty is his face,
And proud as Satan’s, as l watch him pace
The pirate bridge: nor does the cutlass gash,
Wealing his cheeks, disfavor him. His sash
Is silk (I’d buy a dress length if I’d cash).
He does not know, a captive on his ship,
I lie on deck with thongs of nasty rope
Cutting my wrists and ankles —so I cry.
He hears me—looks upon me like a whip.
I feel his glances lash me.... wild with
hope....
Hark! Baby’s crying. I must run. Good-
bye.
His Friends.
They’re just the lowest, lazy, loafing crowd
That ever painted pictures or wrote verse.
They’ve morals not nor manners, and, what’s
worse,
He says he doesn’t care a damn —he’s proud
To call them pals, and says I’m not allowed
To criticise his friends. They sing and curse
And all want me to shout them from my
purse.
O Times alas ! O Manners and O’Dowd.
The only decent man he-ever knew
(But he was nice; he kept a draper’s shop),
lie brought him home one night when he was
tight.
I was ashamed. He called him “Sordid
Jew,”
Then borrowed all his money, and went pop
Because he talked of Bargains all the night.
The House Accounts.
We owe the butcher five pound four and
three.
The baker, his account is one pound two.
The grocer asked to-day if it were true
My husband was the poet-bloke—for he
Had got the whisper he went on the spree,
And didn’t care what bills were overdue.
I told him “Yes.” He said he’d have to sue.
“Tut,” said my husband; “that won’t worry
me.”
I’m sick of it. One day he’s flinging gold
About the place as were it so much dirt;
The next, lie has to cadge his fare to town.
He makes the money (so, at least, I’m told)
Hark: here he is—l hope he bought my
skirt!
Yes, it is he!... .What’s this? A tussore
gown !
Tiie Other Woman.
I often see him sitting, funny-like—
Won’t eat or talk and paces up and down—
And when I ask him questions, he will frown
And say I’d better hop on to my bike.
And (sneering) call on friends for “tea and
caike.”
I ask him if her hair is green or broivn.
And if she wears a pearl and purple gown—■
I just can’t help it; he gives me the spike.
If I could catch her —what a time she’d get!
I’ve read his verse about her. Some fine day
I’ll meet them dreaming dreams of soft de-
light—
And when I’ve finished, you’ll be safe to bet
She won’t have wistful, wondrous eyes of
grey—
I’ll make them blacker than the blackest
night.
QUEENSLAND.
THE POET'S WIFE.
The Last Dance of Reuben
Stodge.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THIS is a curiously unfinished tale, for
there are many people connected with
it whom I never met at all, and some
more whom I lost sight of just when the
situation became interesting. We were all
too late for the funeral, though we cabled
orders for wreaths. The man who ran round
the corner left behind him no explanation
of his mental attitude. I never knew the
exact value of the damage done to O’Hara’s
furniture. I don’t know what the fine might
have been (but wasn’t) for furious cab driv-
ing at the crisis, though the pace, I believe,
was something almost incredible. (The
name of the driver was George Smith,
though he tried to pass himself off to the
policeman as \\ illiani Howler, and the
number of the vehicle was 724 A—or else
"®B.) And I don’t know why Nancy
p ~ra refused to marry me, or why the
futile, unimportant Benjamin Stodge ever
imagined she would marry him ! —which she
didn t.
To get to further details. I never met
Jacob Stodge, the patriarch. He died before
I began to ornament the tale. And eight out
of his twelve sons I never met either —to
Daniel, Zebulon, Manasseli. Levi,
Judah. Asher, Naphtali. and Ephraim. But
1 knew Simeon well, and Simeon was the
best and kindest and most perfect gentleman
1 ever happened upon. There was a streak
of sanguine madness in him though, partly
inherited, I think, and partly acquired
through the habit of waiting for Benjamin
to come of age, and no one seemed to come
of age more gradually than Benjamin. He
was the most lingering youth of his size in
all my experience. And it was characteristic
of his ’bus-missing habit that, after all his
lingering, he came of age just on the one

without a week’s notice."
day in his lifetime when the achievement
was no good to him. He might as well have
gone right back to his infancy and his feed-
ing bottle.
Benjamin was amiable, musical and
useless. I think he blew on six instruments,
including the piano. He hadn’t Simeon’s
streak of picturesque madness, for there
was nothing in particular for the streak to
rest upon. No one could say for certain
that he was a gentleman, for in his shad-
owed position on the back seats of life he
wasn’t sufficiently visible to be made out as
anything in particular. He was girlishly
pretty—not upstanding and handsome like
Simeon; and he should have worn skirts.
Incidentally he had, besides his habit of
blowing on instruments, two definite char-
acteristics. He was, as already indicated, a
confirmed waiter for the inheritance, and,
as hereinbefore suggested, he wanted to
marry Nancy O’Hara.
Reuben was an even bigger man than
Simeon, but of hardly so fine a mental qual-
ity. He was a daring speculator. In that
respect the two brothers were alike. He
had Simeon’s hopeful habit of discounting
the future. Put shortly, he was a pleasant
individual with considerable feet.
Gad Stodge was a boot manufacturer in a
large way. Anybody who looked at him
could see that he was a boot manufacturer
in a large way, and that he specialised in
bluchers with thick soles. He had the boot
expression and the blucher aspect. Gad was
a rock of commercial solvency and integrity
—a leather rock.
This list introduces pretty well all the
characters involved except Patrick O’Hara,
who was Nancy’s brother, and his pretty
wife Anne. O’Hara was a casual sort of
artist who had inherited an income from a
wholly non-artistic Dublin relative named
O’Briggs. He and Anne were both out when
the trouble happened. They were the sort
of people who went out three times oftener
than they came in. This was the result of
their descent from a long line of absentees
and Irish kings.
The story began when Jacob Stodge, the
patriarch, died in Melbourne, full of years
and money and local honor, and was buried
by his twelve sons in the sepulchre of the
two wives who had gone before him. The
papers spoke well of him, and said that his
cheque was good, and his P.N. was never
bad, and when Jacob Stodge said he would
pay cash he dashed down the money on the
spot. Sometimes he dashed it so hard that
it rebounded and the spot was badly dam-
aged.
Jacob Stodge had two special joys in life.
One was his youngest son Benjamin, the
lazy, handsome, casual producer of music;
and the other was that renowned institution,
the Imperishable Bank of Melbourne. He had
been one of the founders of the Bank. He
had been a director from the beginning, and
he was one of the biggest shareholders. By
way of linking together his two chief idols,
he directed that that large part of his for-
tune which was represented by Imperish-
able shares should not be divided until Bon-
jamin came of age. The profits were to
accumulate, and to be invested either in more
Imperishable shares or in Imperishable de-
posits. Having made these satisfactory
arrangements, the old capitalist gathered up
his feet and died contentedly on the brass
bedstead of his ancestors.
Simeon was the only son who lived out-
side Australia. I met him in Maoriland.
He was a financier of many sorts, and, as a
side-line he was a speculator in gold-mining
enterprises. The same trace of poetry or
something which led Benjamin to tootle
absurdly on hollow brass and tinkling cym-
bals. made Simeon a gambler. Twenty shil-
lings worth of gold dug out of the earth
appealed to him more than £5 made in the
dingy ways of trade. He was a bachelor,
like his brother Reuben. Gad was married,
of course, and had a large family—also of
course. A man of Gad’s practical turn
would have regarded it as waste not to have
a large family, when they could be shod at
cost price. If one of his sons had had a
wooden leg it would have broken his heart.
I was also a mining gambler, and a very
young one. At a certain meeting of share-
holders I made a suggestion which was so
astonishingly foolish, or original, or some-
thing, that the chairman—a tall, slender,
dark, immaculate person with strangely bril-
liant eyes—stopped to consider me. He
wore, for the moment, the exact expression
of Moses looking at an ass in the wilder-
ness. My scheme—l forget what it was,
but perhaps I had proposed turning the mine
upside down to let the water fall out of it —
lapsed for want of a seconder. After the
meeting the chairman sought my acquaint-
ance. He was Simeon Stodge. I think he
was wondering whether he ought to see me
home lest T should be run over by a wheel-
IMPUDENT HUSSIES.

barrow en route. He was the sort of man,
out of business hours, who would rescue even
the humblest of God’s creatures from the
jaws of a wheelbarrow.
It was somewhere about two months later
that Simeon told me kindly that I was ten
years too young for the frantic game of lies
and mullock that was being performed in the
gold boom. He enjoyed the sport as a side
line, but it had to be played for all it was
worth, and there was in it a certain amount
of —well, something very like robbery, how-
ever scrupulously the rules were observed.
Then he sat back and smoked in silence for
a time, while the idea gradually soaked into
my consciousness that he wanted me, and
other young amateurs like me, to get out
or the road, because if we got up against
him in some of his operations he would
have to take our money from us, and he
hated to deprive an infant of its natural
sustenance, even in the way of legitimate
business. Simeon hunted big game on the
mining market. Presently he spoke again,
and suggested that I should invest the dam-
aged remnant of my patrimony in Govern-
ment securities, and take a situation. If I
felt that I must have a flutter of some sort
—well, there was a certain wild cat which
had been left on his premises by a dead and
gone speculator—one who had fallen down
and been eaten in the fray. The cat wasn’t
large, and it was nearly perished, but it
might revive. Simeon offered it to me as a pre-
sent so that, in the intervals of honest work,
I might gratify my speculative instincts by
looking at it.
I didn't take this srood advice, of course.
No one ever does. Rut Simeon and I be-
came friends, and twice in the next few
years he showed me the way out of an un-
usually large financial orifice into which I
had dropped. Still I lost steadily on the
whole. Then I fell into the bottomless hole
which finished my little fortune, and nearly
wrecked Simeon also.
The Blue Shrike mine somehow became to
Simeon what the Imperishable Bank had'
been to Jacob, his father. It was a big
undertaking, and he owned more than half
the shares. I owned as many as I could
afford to buy. and backed Simeon’s luck and
judgment. But though the mine was rich
it was strangely cantankerous. There was
rotten rock above it. and a perfect ocean of
water below. Over and over again it took
a new lease of death, just when it seemed to
he alive. The three daughters of the horse-
leech didn’t compare with it for calls. Simeon
grew' haggard and weary-looking as the
struggle went on. It was only some years
later, after his rise and his greatness and
his exceeding great fall, that we learned
what desperate chances he took in those
days, when you might offer a man Blue
Shrike shares as a present, and he scoffed
at you and told you to take them round to
the tradesman’s entrance. I didn’t grow
haggard, for the sufficient reason that I
hadn’t enough money left to grow haggard
about. I took a passage for Melbourne, and
made Simeon a present of my pile of scrip.
He insisted on giving me £lOO for it, which
was £99 10s. more than it was worth. Also
he gave me letters to his brothers Reuben
and Gad. In these documents he hinted
that I was perfectly harmless, and had some
shreds of intelligence so long as I didn’t go
near a Stock lOxchange.
Incidentally I may mention here that the
Blue Shrike mine rose to immense glory,
and paid dividends that were akin to a
king’s ransom. And thereupon Simeon
Stodge went mad. He wasn’t unpleasantly
mad, or obviously mad, or gibberingly mad.
But he had got so near to the gulf of ruin
that his mind became unbalanced when the
strain was lifted. Between his streak of
derangement and his streak of optimism, and
his streak of poetry, and his knowledge that
a great fortune was waiting for him in the
Imperishable Bank, he became a garish
spender, and lived the life of Heliogabulus,
barring the immorality. Incidentally he
sent me a cheque of size, and expressed his
regret that I had lost my hold on the Blue
Shrike before the boom started.
In Melbourne, Gad Stodge received me
and my letter of introduction. He showed
me his wife and she put me on the visiting
list, so that I received an invitation to some
small function at stated intervals of three
months. Also he and Reuben got me an
honest sort of job in a life insurance office.
It was as honest a job as went in Mel-
bourne about that time. Reuben invited me
to his bachelor establishment, and intro-
duced me to Benjamin, the Artistic Im-
possible of the family, whose coming-of-age
was to be the signal for the division of the
bulk of old Jacob’s inheritance —the money
he had locked up carefully, and nailed down
securely, and tied with ropes to a rock so
that it could never get away. Benjamin
hailed me as a brother. There was a con-
necting link between us, because neither of
us could make money, and both of us could
lose it. Like any other gushing child of
Nature, he confided to me his love for
Nancy O’Hara, and introduced me to her
and her belongings. I promptly asked her
to marry me, and she promptly failed to do
so. This happened one evening when Ben-
jamin Stodge was picking out little tunes
on the piano, and Patrick O’Hara and his
wife were out. O’Hara was the last pos-
sibility in the way of a diner-out, a thea-
trical first-nighter and an occupant of cabs.
After that Benjamin and I became two
rejected tame cats on the O’Hara premises.
We were fairly happy and we were good
friends. Curiously enough, by reason of
my friendship for Simeon and Reuben and
Gad and Benjamin, I also got into the habit
of waiting for the youth’s twenty-first birth-
day—the day of great things, when the seal
was to be broken and the vial of affluence
poured out.


The downfall of the Imperishable Bank
Imnneried the evening before Benjamin’s
hfrthday It was the fi t st smash of the
orp-it downfall, and it was the worst. Papers
dav were full of it, and one pessimistic
oJo-an hinted plainly that the fixed depo-
«Hors had no hope, and that the shareholders
had a great deal less. People with current
accounts were urged to trust in Providence,
hut not to trust too hard. Calls were to
he made immediately. In the evening the
naoers mentioned that the manager was ill.
Tt was afterwards alleged that he was dead,
mk,, report was contradicted, but he was
hndlv bruised on the top of the head where
a customer of the female variety had smitten
him with an umbrella in her despair. Later
t was rumored that a high official of the
hank had tied for foreign parts, taking with
an almost imperceptible amount in stolen
cash— all he could get—also a stolen lady,
the barmaid at the Bull and .Tumble Hotel.
No one cared whether he had done so or not.
H e might have fled unnoticed with the Burke
and Wills monument under his arm in these
Two small institutions closed the same

the banner of reconstruction! little
business was done. People already began to
talk to themselves in the streets and to wear
a far-off expression. And that afternoon I
received a hurried letter from Nancy O’Hara.
Patrick and his wife were out—whenever
were they anything else? And Benjamin
Stodge had just come of age in her drawing-
room. and was full of lamentations. He had
renewed his proposals, and he wanted Nancy
to marry him at once because he was ruined.
That was the reason he assigned, and the
oirl thought it inadequate. Anyhow, she
wanted moral support, so I 'fled to the scene.
There I found Benjamin holding Nancy s
hand. He had been doing it for half an
hour, and she didn’t like to take her hand
away, because it seemed to be the crushed
little man’s only consolation. I summarily
dragged them apart, and took the rude
measure of forcing Benjamin to drink
whisky. The effect on him —for he was a
most abstemious character —was wonderful.
He bucked up and defied Fate. He would
have thrown all O’Hara’s furniture at Fate
if he had found that creature prowling
around. He was ready to search the house
and garden for it, and knock its head off, or
drag it round despitefully by the tail.
His mirthful mood lasted all through
dinner, and then began to die down. Pre-
sently something happened, which blew out
the effect of the whisky as if it had been a
wax match in a gale. .
The tall figure of Reuben Stodge stood in
the doorway. He was hatless, and his even-
ing suit was sodden with rain. And, it i
could form a guess, Reuben was quite crazy.
He greeted us gaily, and then he sat down
and talked brilliantly, and at full speed,
about all things beneath the sun. He gave
no one time to reply. His hostess grew ob-
viously anxious. Benjamin shrank into a
smaller compass. lie was probably halt
inclined to leap into the outer wet and leave
ns. But the time when he shrank almost
to nothing was when Reuben suddenly de-
cided that the one supremely appropriate act
would be to have a dance in the drawing-
room, and ordered Benjamin to play the
piano. That person viewed the situation
with outstanding terror, but he complied.
Nancy humored the happy bankrupt, and the
waltz of two commenced.
The result was something terrible.
Reuben, despite his large feet, was generally
a finished dancer. To-night lie became a
shouting fury who clamored to Benjamin
to play faster, and dragged Nancy around
with ever-increasing velocity. Her face was
presently crimson, and her eyes were full ot
tears. Half the time she was off her feet
and being hurled through the air. Reuben
made me think of a gorilla who had stolen a
white maiden, and was thereafter trying _to
square the circle in an African forest with
her in his arms. He was a wet, bare-headed
whirlwind. Anne O’Hara’s ornaments and
frills and gimcracks (she was a very gim-
crackery person) began to melt under his
boots like thin mists flying before a Biscay
gale. He spilt them freely, and he trod on
them with unseeing hoofs. If he didn t
tread on them at the first time of asking he
did the second time or third. Any time was
good enough for Reuben, in the frenzy of
his joy. Sometimes when he had Nancy off
her feet lie would sweep down things with
her, just as if she had been a club. Her
neatly shod extremities had never been put
to such a use before.
Twice I dodged across the room in an
effort to tear Benjamin from the piano, with
the hope that when the music stopped the
dance would cease also, but each time
Reuben, with rage in his eye, collided with
’ me artistically and I staggered back.
Then I saw red, and went in haste to the
backyard to get the axe. I wasn’t going to
attack a man so vastly my physical superior
with my bare hands, nor was I going to let
Nancy be killed by a slow process of towage
and draggage round her brother’s apartment,
amid all this ruined furniture. I meant to
cut down the eldest son of the House of
Stodge in all the flower and bloom of his
derangement.
But even in my sudden heroism I knew it
would be a good thing if a sturdy boot-manu-
facturing reinforcement was coming up in
the rear. It would he like Blucher at Water-
loo. With the backyard axe in my hand, and
murder in my soul, I still had sense enough
to waylay Mary Ann Jane Jemima Jones and
send her' on an errand. I gave her largesse,
and bade her flee hatless into the rain. I
would have told her to flee naked with no
more compunction. She was to stay not for
brake and stop not for briar, but. borne on
the uttermost wings of a four-wheeler, she
was to make for the house of Gad Stodge,
only four streets away. And if the gods
were kind to her, and she found that good
old standby of the family, she was to tell him
that Reuben was dancing in the bosom of
Patrick O’Hara’s household, that he seemed
quite unable to stop, and that he was raking
down the ceiling with his feet. Further-
more, that he was carrying a lady in his
arms, and that the furniture left unbroken
was hardly worth mentioning. Mary Ann
Jane Jemima Jones scuttled like the four
winds that blow in Heaven or the seven devils
that clamor round the present home of
Judas Iscariot.
Then I took the axe and made for the
Hall of Gimcracks, where the smash of
Anne’s belongings still continued, and the
feet of Reuhen still pounded, and Benja-
min, too terrified to stop, was playing all
manner of discords ; and Nancy, her courage
quite gone at last, was weeping loudly, and
begging to be set down. Inwardly I
cursed Patrick OTlara for being out. In-
wardly I reflected that the neighbors con-
sisted of a superannuated civil servant and
two old maids, and that the police station
was very far away. Then I set out to do
my first murder, and was intercepted by a
drowned boy.
HE KNOCKED OFF WORK TO CARRY BRICKS.
EMINENT COMEDIAN (to former professional friend): “Great Scott, Trevaskis! What are
you doing?"
THE MAN WITH THE HOD : “ Resting , dear boy — resting."
It is difficult to keep the thread of this
tragedy. But in order to piece together the
scattered fragments, this is as good a place
as any for a word of explanation as to how
Gad had spent the strenuous day when the
great fortune of Jacob went the downhill
track of all flesh, and left no footprint be-
hind it. At the very first moment when
business was possible he began to take in
sail on his over-masted boot industry. He
turned some scrip into cash, and, lest other
banks should be going the way of the Imper-
ishable, he didn’t deposit the cash, but locked
it in his strong room. He drew out as much
of his balance- —he didn’t bank at the Imper-
ishable —as he thought he could do without
creating an appearance of panic, and added
that to the reserve in the strong room. He
gave his manager a list of customers to be
harried for money, and of a few others who,
if they rushed in with large orders, were, to
be told that the stream of boots had dried
up at the meter. Having thus made what
preparation he could for the storm, the mer-
chant put his Babylonish garment on his
head —that is to say, he donned his radiant
plug hat —and went out to find Benjamin.
The family always went to find Benjamin
when trouble threatened that youth, he being
quite incapable of finding himself. On the
doorstep Gad met all the men whose supplies
he had cut off, and they all looked like per-
sons who were bent on making large pur-
chases on credit. He congratulated himself
on his foresight. . . . .
But he pursued Benjamin m vain. ±ha L
youth wasn’t at his rooms. He wasn’t at.
the musical and artistic club which he
affected. Pifflheimer, the eminent composer,
hadn’t seen him. Nor had Slumpheimer, the
still more eminent composer, whose works
were said to be known all over Europe, Asia,
Africa and America, though Slumpheimer
possessed what might possibly prove a clue.
This was an unpublished song-and-dance com-
position of Benjamin’s dealing with a gum-
tree in B flat. Gad rejected the clue with
scorn. He didn’t know of the frequent ren-
dezvous at O’Hara’s house, so he didn’t go
there. But he went on his errand of con-
solation to his elder brother’s office, and there
he met with panic and disorder.
Reuben, it seemed, had read the news of the
great downfall. After a little while spent
in deep thought he had uttered a sort of dog-
howl, and left in such haste that he had trod-
den on a junior clerk in his flight. Solomon-
son, his chief clerk, feared the worst. He
thought his employer had sped to the lunatic
asylum in ordcm to get in early and avoid the
crush —that he was running for the early
door, so to speak, and wanted a front seat.
Solomonson had other troubles. He con-
fided to the more capable brother that the
firm had lately been gambling beyond its
means, and with no very great success. It
was loaded up with securities of a kind
which couldn’t stand the storm of deprecia-
tion that had already set in. In fact, it had
passed in the last few hours from precarious
solvency to something that could hardly
be distinguished from bankruptcy. Solo-
monson thought he could save it, yet,
if he had authority to realise, but he
had none. He had sent out emissaries, in-
cluding the trodden-on junior, to find the
lost boss, and he hadn’t been found. He saw
his way, by hard lying, to stave off awkward
demands for that day, and perhaps the next
day, unless the head of the firm advertised
his mental failure by undressing himselt ip
Collins-street. If he undressed either there
or in Flinders-street, or even on St. Iviicla-
road, anything might happen at short notice.
The heat and burden of Solomonson s per-
oration was this: Could the boot-man suggest
any way to uphold the reeling fabric of the
House of Stodge?
Gad had nothing to suggest, and went away
with a new trouble on his shoulders. The
next he heard of his two brothers was when
the handmaiden Jones arrived in a breathless
cab to summon him to the dance and the
debris.
Incidentally, we never learned where the
mad visitant obtained his dress-suit. He
didn’t go home for a change of clothes, and
he had no clothes at his office —besides, he
never went back to his office, and we never
acquired any reliable news as to where he
went. He may have found the outfit in the
street, and done his change in a fourpenny
restaurant or in the Fitzroy Gardens, but
there was no evidence. He may have bought
it, but we couldn’t trace the seller. He may,
being a man of brawn, have robbed a com-
plete stranger of his garniture outside a
theatre, but no naked stranger fleeing through
the rain was mentioned in the papers, nor
was anything discovered to suggest that Reu-
ben might have slain his victim. It was all
a tale of mystery and imagination.
As already mentioned, I was going into
O’Hara’s drawing-room, or what little re-
mained of it, with O’Hara’s backyard axe in
my hand, to slay or cripple the eldest son,
when I was' intercepted by a drowned boy.
At least, he was a miserably sodden boy. He
had pursued me for a long distance with an
urgent telegram. I gave him a shilling and
postponed the murder for a second while I
read the news. It was, briefly, to the effect
that Simeon had shot himself that day, sit-
ting on the steps of the battery house of the
Blue Shrike mine.
For a moment all the world went dark,
and I dropped the axe in the hall. To think
that Simeon, that courteous gentleman,
should come to such an end seemed impossi-
ble. Of course, the explanation, when it
came to hand, proved quite simple. In the
midst of his glory and lavishness and mega-
lomania a whole ocean had burst in on the
Blue Shrike and finished it. Simeon was
just looking at the wreck of one-half his for-
tunes when an unusually prompt telegram
informed him that the Imperishable Bank
had taken the other half. Probably Simeon
felt that it was hardly worth while to start
the whole battle of life afresh at his age. So
he cut the business short.
I rushed into the drawing-room and
shouted the news in hope of making a
diversion. Benjamin heard me, and, despite
his terror of his big, crazed brother, he
ceased playing handfuls of discords, and
dropped his head miserably on the keys.
Reuben also seemed to hear at the third time
of asking, for he slowed down and then
stopped. Nancy, with her dress torn and
her hair all dishevelled, sank on the floor,
and sat there with her back to the wall.
Benjamin gathered her up and carried her
to the only chair which retained even the
semblance or hollow mockery of being a
chair. The dancing man pondered the tele-
gram.
Then for no visible reason he passed out
of the room and out of the house, and began
to run with long strides down the path.
Perhaps he meant to run straight to Main-
land and attend his brothers funeiaL
Gad was hastening up the path wearing
his most resolute and boot-manufacturing
expression. Close behind, looking wet but
very self-important, trotted the kitchen hand-
maiden, Jones. To her the events probably
represented a fine penny novelette. *ur
ther back a policeman was rushing towards
the gate. Just outside the eate was a four
wneeled cab. and what looked like a dea 1
horse standing up. I thought at first the officer
of the law was a reinforcement, but lie
wasn’t. He was a dunderheaded and most
inopportune enemy, and he wanted the boot
dealer on four charges: (1) furious cab
bing- (2) driving on the pavement, t-H
driving a public vehicle without a license ,
'4) insane cruelty to a horse that was ol
enough to know better.
The fact was that the servant had given,
all in a breath, such a thrilling account ot
the murders that Iteuben was doing-, or just
going to do, that Gad was moved to extra-
ordinary efforts. While Miss Jones scram-
bled into the back of the vehicle he hat
climbed up beside the bidden him
drive like the bitterness of death. Then, not
satisfied with the pace, he had seized the
reins himself and beaten the horse furiously
with his umbrella, and started to cut otr
street corners in order to save a second or
two. Some 200 yards from the end of the
trip a policeman had noticed the _ii' re »ula
proceedings, and had launched himself in
o£ the drama was performed with
a rush. The tall, lank brother ran down the
path. The short, thick brother cast his bell-
topper from him by way of clearing the
decks for action, and spread out Ins arms
for a clutch. Reuben dodged. Gad dodged.
There was temporary confusion all round
and then Gad was down, but by means ot
his desperate grasp of one of his opponent s
coat-tails he was still an active and partia y
mobilised force, though lie was being badly
dragged and gravel-rashed. But a tar»e
piece of garment came away, and this broke
the line of communication. The long bro-
ther, by brilliant footwork, avoided the
policeman, and went through the gate like
a whirlwind. The brief brother, still en-
cumbered by the dead weight of Reuben s
coat-tail, trotted sternly after him, and was
captured by the officer when he had done
about two steps.
The insane struggles of the wholesale boot
man, and his swears, and his explanations
deserved to be written in the chronicles of
kings. He got away presently, and reached
the gate, but the eldest son was gone.
And, amazing as it may seem, that was,
so far as my knowledge goes, the last that
was ever seen or heard of the dancer whose
feet had shattered Patrick’s drawing-room,
and made hay and ruin of Anne s brittle
decorations. The Yarra was searched for
him, likewise the bay and the foreshores.
Inquiries were made at police stations, ran
way stations, hospitals, lunatic asylums, on
board ships and around wharves. All other
possible places were raked. It was to no
purpose. The cabman didn’t see him go.
He was busy holding up his fainting horse
with one hand, and inspecting the ruins ot
Gad’s umbrella with liis other eye. The
policeman, instead of joining in the chase,
had come up to the house, decorated with a
blackened optic (plainly the merchant had
hit out to some purpose), and was busy
taking our names and addresses, and looking
at the damage, and inquiring why the axe
was in the hall. Furthermore, he wanted
to know if any of us had shown previous
signs of insanity. So he saw nothing. It
seems incredible that a tall, wet, bare-headed
lunatic, dressed in an evening suit with one
tail missing, could thus run out of human
ken at the turning of a street; yet that was
what Reuben did.
ONE POINT IN THEIR FAVOR.
“ Well, wotcher staring at? They're straighten
than yours , anyhow
My idea is that he lost his memory and his
sense of identity, and that, having run
into the country by accident, he went on the
land. In that case he may, in his old age, be
cockying somewhere to this day, in com-
plete ignorance of the fact that he was once
a great financier, and was rich in the shares
of the Imperishable Bank.
The policeman repented of his leniency
and arrested Gad next day on five charges—
the extra one being the black eye. But the
defence was so good that the plaintiff was
censured for gross incompetence, and the
defendant was released on his own recog-
nisances, and one security in the sum of
eighteenpence, on condition that he didn’t
drive cabs for the space of 12 months.
Beniamin took to performing in an orches-
tra. The nine capable brothers held a sort
of inquest on the incapable one. None of
them offered him a job, but they decided to
supplement such income as remained to him by
buying him an annuity. Also, they advised him
to blow on some instrument in order to fill
in time and keep him out of mischief. Ben-
jamin, after a hopeless struggle to find a pub-
lisher for his song-and-danee concerning a
gumtree in B flat, took the advice in a
humble spirit, and blew accordingly.

Love at the Butcher’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rTIHE shop was a study in the red of beef,
I the pink of mutton, the dead white
and yellow of different fats, and the
gleam of emery-polished steel. And there
was quite an armory of knives, sinuous,
pointed, evilly-sharp. The hissing scrape of
these upon steels swaying from leathern
waist-belts was terrible to hear —almost as
bad, in fact, as the thudding of the mur-
derous choppers. The scrubbed creaminess
of deal side-tables, the corpulent chopping-
blocks, blue and white wall tiles, with the
heads of Herefords imprinted thereon, the
altar-like purity of marble counters, the
glitter of scales and plate-glass—such was
No. 3 branch.
’Arry, temp’ry manager of this Temple of
Meat, was a dandy in white duck, with
sleek, black hair fringed at the edge like the
THE RULING PASSION.
“There goes t ’ knockin' -off bell"
“Yes, we'll get double time from now!"
feathers of a spring chicken. Small, black
of eye, blue of jowl, dimpled of chin, alert,
hustling, he was a butcher of whom any girl
might be proud ; and Miss Emily Oddy teas
proud of him. She stood at the marble
counter smartly slapping pounds of meat
into chunks of daily news and picking change
from the register with the neatness and
despatch of a first-rate conjurer.
She was a cashier and a happy one, for
she and ’Arry had come to an understanding.
Proof of it gleamed from Em Oddy’s finger
—63 s. worth of jewellery. Em was a small,
sandy spitfire with a milky-white throat and
the knack of smart hairdressing. She could
be loving as Mrs. Potiphar and as stubborn
as a mule. ’Arry had as yet only encoun-
tered her angelic side. All day while she
wrapped meat and played the cash register
she saw, through the ever-shifting haze of
mutable shoppers, a rosy mirage of her
future, with ’Arry hustling and successfully
vending meat at large profits. The present
sufficed for ’Arry. Content made his voice
silvery; his trade sing-song was beautiful to
listen to. “Nice da-ay! Looks like ra-in!
’Eavenly weather we’re ’avin ! Two an’ an
’arf ! Thank you !”
On Friday afternoon when the influx of
women, all tigerishly seeking meat, would
have made some butchers wish themselves
dead, ’Arry sprang cheerfully from hook to
block, from block to scales, affable, eloquent
on the subject of his stock, patient unto the
triumphant end. Even with the most
captious, his voice see-sawed up and down
melodiously. ’Arry addressed them accord-
ing to appearance merely, as “Mrs.” or
“Miss,” with a long drawn and buzzing con-
tinuation of the final “s” as though he had
momentarily forgotten the name he had
never known and expected it to return with
a rush. Nobody was deceived. ’Twas but a
polite habit of trade, and, had the customer
possessed devilment enough to supply the
missing word, ’Arry would have fallen to
the sawdust with surprise. The value of
every bit of meat he sold he enhanced by
appreciative comment. “Oh, ya-as, Mrs-s-s!
Nice bit —o’ beef ! Bin ’angin—eat well!”
( Chop-chop .) He apologised like a greasy
duke for the occasional flying fragments of
skewer. “Sorry, Mrs.-s-s! Anything else?
Thanks, Mrs.-s-s ! (A bit o’ dog’s meat for
the lady, Pimples!”) And having turned
his customer over the counter, ’Arry would
catch the eye of ‘Next!"
“Next,” pressing close to the block, has a
wffiispered confidence to make. ’Arry is
polite but incredulous. “Not from 'ere,
Mrs.-s-s! No poor shanks kept in stock
'ere! Oh, 'im!" (a rival butcher). “Yes,
very likely. Y’ see, he hasn’t the capital to
buy the best stuff. Oh, ya-as! There’s a
difference in quality, some only buys the
rejecks—the lefts —the third-class stuff.
Now our firm”
So Harry held on to the job of temp’ry
manager of No. 3 branch, and drawled and
misused the British language out of sheer
buoyancy.
It was a good job, its only drawback
being the boss, a malevolent pasty-faced
brute shaped like his own chopping-block.
Sometimes he took scowling control, and
sent nervous shudders through women cus-
tomers by mumbling full-fed curses while
smashing the innocent pink-and-white lamb
upon the block. He was an erratic person
reeking of rum, and would sometimes stand
rigid with poised cleaver and drink-mad-
dened eyes, staring at horrid visions in the
interior of a clean carcase. Pie was a bully,
at whose approach Pimples, the assistant,
would scuttle like a rabbit. Pimples was a
narrow-headed, scorbutic youth with whom
the habit of grinning servility amounted to
a natural gift. In the dreadful presence of
the boss he became hopelessly incoherent
and fumbled like an idiot. Hither and
thither he would bolt, skidding into the
sausages, sliding into the “corned.” Had
the boss’s cleaver descended and cleft his
narrow skull in twain his headless trunk
would still have hurried round with pounds
ot dripping, servile even in decapitation.
It was 11 p.m. when Em and ’Arry, both
of them in a state of trepidation, reached
the gate of Em’s home. Em’s father was
soaked in old-fashioned views on the “early-
to-bed-early-to-rise” subject. “Locked in or
locked out at 10.30” was one of his maxims,
and being out later meant in his opinion a
first-class ticket for Hades. Em trembled
as she approached the paternal wrath. She
was in an oyerwrouglit state to begin with.
The evening spent with ’Arry at some raqk-
etty future-in-law’s had not been a suc-
cess. Em, genteely unapproachable on first
acquaintance, had not shown to
advantage, and ’Arry, chilled by
her own unresponsiveness, hail
seemed quite a different person
to the ’Arry who “Ya-aas”-ed
all day amid his setting of meat.
And now here she was. entirely
through his fault, out at an hour
when all respectable people were
under lock and key.
“What’s the odds? He might
’ave ; put th’ key out,” said ’Arry.
“’Tisn’t as though you was one
o’ these late owls, Em.”
“Late owls !” tittered spitfire
Em, ready to burst into flame.
“Who says I am?”
“Nobody. Em—so you needn’t
be putting words into my mouth
I never said !”
This wasn’t at all loverlike,
and Em caught her breath un-
pleasantly. There was some
futile fumbling for the key. Then
Harry knocked with decision.
The door was flung open so
quickly as to suggest that some-
one had been dozing against it.
The surprised culprits hurriedly
retreated to the gate. It was
Em’s father, in all tlie cold
purity of his nightshirt. Red
slippers made a cheerful splash
against the white. He advanced,
his slippers flapping the floor
and the wind teasing his whis-
kers. He raised a commanding
hand. So might Moses have
stood on the borders of the Red
Sea.
“Recreant! Emissary of the Devil! Thus
to lure from rectitude the weaker vessel!
(Silence!” as ’Arry attempted a defence.)
“Em-ily! have I not forbidden nocturnal
wanderings with Lotharios —with rogues and
vagabonds?. ... ( Silence, I say !!) Have
you anything to say ere I cast you out?
(Silence !!)”
“Oh, wot rot! Just let Em in, carn’t yer?
JUSTICE IS ANSWERED.
THE J.P. : “This is a serious charge—drunk
and disorderly. What have you to say?”
THE ACCUSED : “ Guilty , Bill. I had a
of a time after I got you home."
She ain’t ter blame —been at my people’s
place.”
“Silence ! ! I will not listen to your
specious argument!”
’Arry here laughed nervously. It was a
bad move. Em burst into tears.
“Mocker! Leave my home!” cried the
shirted one. He waved his arm at them.
“Away ! !”
But by this time ’Arry’s mirth had turned
to rage. He took off his coat. “Come out,
ol' man!” he said. “Get your duds on an’
come out! (No, Em! I don’ want ter
strike the old bloke. But is ’e goin’ to in-
sult you and call me names for nothin’?
Mo! Let ’im fight it out if he’s a man at
all.) Come out here you!"
“ ‘Let dogs delight to b. k an’ bite,’ ”
quoted the absurd spook, now in full retreat.
“Wot! Won’t you come out?”
“ ‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil there-
of,’ ” answered the furious saint. Then he
pointed his Finger of Scorn at his daughter
and raised his voice to a howl. “Em-i-ly!
do not darken this door again!” The said
door then banged to.
Em, sobbing convulsively, shook off ’Arry’s
protective arm. “You shouldn’t have laughed,
’Arry! He would have forgiven me!”
“ For-given!" he echoed in amaze. “Wot’s
’e yot ter forgive—th’ narrer-minded ol’
fraud.”
“But what am I to do?” wailed Em.
“I’m locked out.”
“You’ll come straight to my mother’s
place, that’s what you'll do, Em ! That ol’
waster ain’t fit”
“OH ! Off / / Me father —and you call
him that!"
“Ya-as, Em! he’s your father, but he ain’t
mine—not yet anyhow !”
“Nor ever will be l" sobbed the foolishly
loyal spitfire. “Nor ever will be! Here!
you shan’t call him names !” She tugged at
her glove.
“Chuse between us then!” said ’Arry
tragically. “I’m a better man than 'im!"
“I chuse this way, then!” panted Em.
Something bright and small spun past ’Arry
and jingled in the dry gutter. Bereft of
speech, ’Arry followed it with his eyes. Then
Em took to her heels and reached the back
gate, which the Saint had somehow omitted
to fasten. A door slammed, a key turned
and all was still.
’Arry, a mere tangle of warring emotions,
stood quite still for a while. Then he
struck matches which immediately went out,
and groped for the 635. worth of pearls and
rubies Em had cast away with his love. In
the room directly above Em was sobbing as
she curled her hair. ’Arry in the street
choked and swore pathetically.
They met next day as strangers. Em was
glacial. ’Arry, tragic and unshaven, wore a
bulldog expression, and many customers
wondered how he had ever seemed pleasing.
Yet who could fathom the burning wounds,
the torturing remorse those unbending ex-
teriors covered?
“She began it!” said Harry fiercely to
the sausage-meat. “She began it —let ’er
end it!” He threw meat before her for
wrapping with the business-like indifference
due to a mere cashier, instead of the subtly-
flattering action of yesterday, when the
pitching of beef before her partook of the
beauty of a rite. Em’s heart, beneath the
wondrous neatness of her blouse, almost
burst. How was she to know of his pas-
sionate desire to kick the meat to perdition
and snatch her to his white duck breast?
"Oh, ya-as,” he droned to a chatty customer.
“Ya-as, it’s nice steak.” (Was the silver in
his voice dead? Had it not a leaden note?)
“Ya-as, you'll find it eat well—best o’ beef
and killed larst Sat-dee.” The lady then
drew a comparison between the meats of
Melbourne and Sydney and decided for Syd-
ney. ’Arry, much to her surprise, sided with
her. “Ya-as, Sydney’s the place f’r me—
th’ firm’s got branches there.” (Buzz-Buzz-
s-st.) The saw momentarily monopolises
his attention. He finds- time while skewer-
ing to continue : “More charnces in Sydney.
I’m trying to get transferred there.”
Em’s heart bounded, as indeed he meant
it should. Did lie really mean it? Appar-
ently so, for: “Oh. ya-as. Mrs-s-s, ’nother
month, an’ you’ll see me in Sydney. Mel-
bourne’s no good ter me.” And so the small
meat tragedy dragged through the day and
for many other days and weeks. With un-
satisfied love gnawing at their vitals, the two
human mules grew pale and thin. One ten-
der beefsteak word and either would have
capitulated; but that word, alas, was not
slapped on the sentimental counter.
Meanwhile others wished to play the bee
to Em’s honeysuckle. Their suits never pros-
pered—dog-in-the-manger ’Arry saw to that.
To Court Em was to court disaster.
There was a casual attached to No. 3 for
Fridays, who, when most assiduous in his
suit, found himself suddenly baptised in brine
through ’Arry’s unfortunate clumsiness. It
might have been an accident, though the
“Sorry” suitable to such an occasion was
omitted. Then the outfitter’s hireling next
door, who was always ogling
Em, met with an accident.
He slipped on a piece of
suet dropped by some care-
less hand, and spoiled a pair
of sage-green pants by con-
tact with greasy sawdust.
Yet in spite of these
eligibles, Em reserved her
favors for one who was the
antithesis of ’Arry, and was
not so much a man as a
tower of grease. This! was
Eddy, a young giant who
drove up with clangor and
rumble and dived beneath a
tarpaulin and emerged bear-
ing bodies upon his back;
who, bending beneath huge
sides of beef, impaled the
same deftly on the polished
hooks. He jested and smiled
’neatli his awful burdens, his
long blue overalls meanwhile
flapping round his legs and
his head hooded in a sack.
But out of his working
costume Eddy was a handsome fellow with
curls and foolish rolling eyes. ’Arry had
long tolerated him as a necessary fool with
too much hair; now he was called upon to
regard him seriously, and as a rival. For
Em was civil to Edward, and why not?
The Amalgamated Butchers’
ball was on the tapis. Pimples,
overhearing Eddy and Em in
conclave, was able to report
that Eddy was to escort her
thither. The very next call,
Eddy, having delivered his load
at No. 3 Branch, found himself
behind the shop, fighting the
“temp’ry manager” of it. It
was a fierce contest, and when
it was over, sawdust and blood
disfigured the rivals. Em, hear-
ing the thumps and bumps and
sliding of feet, remained
statuesquely calm; yet it is
possible that, beneath her
Roman peace, she felt some-
thing of the savage pride of the
cave-maiden fought for with
club and spear, when Harry,
pale and breathless, but other-
wise unhurt, returned to the
interminable “Oh, ya-as-s!” of
business.
It was the night of the ball.
Emmie, genteely late, came in
on an arm. She was a vision
of heavenly blue. The full
approval of one pair of eyes was
all she asked of fortune, and
the boon was hers before she
had been in the room two min-
utes. ’Arry’s eyes, black and
glittering, shone wildly at her from
behind the pillar He looked ill, also
mad and inarticulate with jealous fury.
“Em! Em!” he groaned inwardly, as she
swung by, her skirt brushing his ankles.
Then, unable to bear the torture any longer,
he wandered from the nath of temperance to
the bar, where he started to drown sorrow
like a cat in small beers.
It was from the bar he was dragged at a
late hour by a harassed M.C. Too many of
the Amalgamated Butchers were clinging
like limpets to the counter of refreshment,
when they were, according to programme,
due in the ballroom beyond. The official was
hard put to it to find partners for the dis
appointed ladies who lined the walls.
“Come on, ’Arry ! On’y one er twocouphs
wanted—complete a set — here y are ! Any
found himself hooked to a lady in the lan-
cers. He unis “ corners ” with Em! W ea ‘ v
from emotion, they swung in silence. Pouiti
time!”
Spinning like the wind —everybody
spinning—laughter—heat-emotion —fumes of
drink—’Em’s face like a rose within an inch
of his 0wn!!.... The cave man suddenly
awoke in the butcher. “My girl! ’ he growled
savagely. “My Girl!” and kissed her full
on the lips.
The morning after the ball saw a. new
’Arry, determined and exalted. From the
moment of last night’s kiss he had not seen
Em. But to-day the affair must be clinched ;
Em was his girl, and she had got to admit
it. On the surface he was suffering from
the swollen head of the male conqueror -
also, the fat head of liquor and emotion.
But beneath the crust ran a stream of the
purest love. With his black cat sitting
firmly on his shoulder he doggedly barred
the way as the cashier appeared at the door.
But the cashier wasn’t Em! She was a
stranger with a face as white as pork. ’Arry
stared at her in stupid surprise. She
scented love at first sight-
“ What! Didn’t yer know I was due here
ter-day? I’m from No. 2 branch. Yes! in
Miss Oddy’s place. Didn’t yer know she
was gettin’ transferred out of here?”
Something inside ’Arry snapped. It was
his pride—his dashed mulish pride! Had
Em appeared at that precise moment he
would have crawled to her on his knees.
Going into the ice-chamber, he leant against
a carcase and wept hot tears.
It was a day of tragedy. The hard-drink-
ing boss, making up his muddled mind that
No. 3 needed his attention, was gibbering
dreadfully at the mutton. ’Arry’s own affairs
being in a chaotic condition, he neglected
those of the firm, and actually allowed one
of the customers to escape without meat.
But he didn’t care. His heart was broken.
Being afraid to curse his temp’ry manager
for this slip, the boss freely cursed the less
valuable Pimples for something else, and,
his rage-distorted face happening to burst
upon a group of harmless customers through
a curtain of sausages, there was something
like a panic. The wretched Pimples, being
drawn as by a magnet into the bully’s
danger zone, grinned with propitiatory trem-
ulousness.
How it happened no one knew. Perhaps
the whisky-maddened man meant it merely
as a reproof for a grinning pig’s head hung
on a level with his own ; or perhaps he took
the dead porker for some self-righteous tem-
perance reformer; or he may have thought
that the porker was smirking Pimples, or
Pimples the smirking porker. At any rate,
he tried quite suddenly to cleave Pimples
do\yn the middle with a chopper.
’Arry saw the move, and was just in time
to wind his leg round the unstable ones of
the maniac. Together with a topside of
steak and a jangle of professional imple-
ments, they fell —’Arry with a broken leg
under 16st. of enraged dipsolunatic. Rut
Pimples was unhurt, and the pig’s head, still
grinning inanely, swung gently op its hook-
The public shouted and screamed in a help-
ful manner, and the local police force —both
of it- —charged in the open door.
Later in the day Em called at ’Arry’s
place with her hat on crooked and her eyes
very bright. She was careful to explain to
’Arry’s mother that she had come for her
macintosh, “an’ could she see ’Arry—jus’
for a minit?” She could. ’Arry’s mother
personally conducted her to the bedroom
where he lay with his injured leg in splints
and pillows at his back. His mother had a
frightful lot to say, and hadn’t said it all
when she was called away by a smell of
something burning. They were alone !
“Em!" he cried. “EM!!” He held out
his arms pathetically, and she fell into them
carefully like a clockwork figure. For a
little while they cried together—a gentle,
sanctifying drizzle. And, when at last the
weather had dried up—
“Th’ boss ’as been taken to a ’nebriate

“Oh, ’ Arry!"

THE APE
For the "BULLETIN"
We brought the ape from the Sarawak coastVl to study his monkey-brain;
In the cause of science we watched his ways Viand found he was wholly sane.
Nothing was wrong with his physical scheme.\\ and his mind Had no detect;
He was, in fact, an immaculate ape—a simian Wall-correct.
We taught him the art of speech—a plamo^
Whereby to study the primal man. Vk
And soon he talked with a perfect ease, while smoking a large cigar,
Of the calculi, or the epiblast, or the parallax of a star.
Of deep-sea slimes, and the aeroplane, the platypus and the soul.
The gyroscope, and the Pentateuch-, and the true magnetic pole.
We marvelled at his receptive turn—
The infinite pains he took to learn!
And when we had thoroughly trained his mind to a fine didactic trim.
By an introspective method we knew we could learn a lot from him.
We asked him concerning early man, whose alterant bones we find;
Of what he was like in habit and thought in the days of the nascent mind?
An excellent scheme, you must admit.
To study the source of human wit.
Well, it wasn’t the fault of that cultured soul, with intellects far from slow,
But he was quite at a loss at once, and said that he did not know;
He couldn't give the remotest clue to the growth of the psychic Me—
When he left the plane of established fact lie was hopelessly out at sea.
Which goes to show, in a kind of wav.
That facts are ruled by the time of day.
> M fej.
For when it came to the wordless lore of the weird Pleistocene,
He knew no more than we knew ourselves (and the blanks all in between):
He cudgelled his brains and searched his soul, striving witlt might and main,
But he couldn’t, replace that early phase of the growth of the human brain.
But this, of course, it occurs to you.
Was asking him rather much to do.
So we put him away in his garish cage, and carefully doused his glim—
Although he might have done it himself, we didn’t rely on him;
And we sat and smoked, discussing the facts, till the whisky was fairly done,
Then crept to bed, as gentlemen should, who wish to forestall the sun.
We each retired to con the thought;
“An ape may teach what an ape is taught.”

The Judgment Dagoes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
1. HAD a dream that cheered my heart,
For slumber put me wise:
I saw the Judgment-Dagoes start
The Cafe Paradise!
The angels, tier on tier of wings,
Were ranged in bright array
To chant the end of earthly things,
The song of Judgment Day—
When swift, with hoots and cheerful shrieks
As Gabriel blew the call,
A perfect tidal-wave of Greeks
Came surging o’er the wall :
The fat, the thin, the oily souls,
The squat, with whiskers curled.
They climbed like crayfish up in shoals
From over all the world !
With fiddles warped and flattened frets
They drowned the sacred harps:
They played Mascagni’s inter mezz.
In forty-seven sharps:
And when an angel rose to ope
The Book of Deaths and Lives,
Obsequious Dagoes oped the lids
With skilful oyster-knives,
And pulled the pages out in clots,
And stored them into crates,
And swiftly buttered all the lots,
And served them up on plates.
The din grew Old and wilder yet,
No business could be done ;
A stern archangel made the threat
He’d doom them, every one —
When up rose Spiropopolos,
An oyster-agent he,
Within his paw a Cray he’d caught
From out the Jasper Sea.
And rushing where the saint arose
’Mid staring souls and Greeks,
He thrust the crayfish ’neath his nose
And charged him “one-an’-seex !”
I sav a flash of humor smite
The saint. Within his beard
A slow smile spread ; his anger fled :
The souls rose up and cheered.
The devils leapt, the angels danced.
The stars broke into song ;
And Paradise, within a trice,
Became a restauronfir/
For, as I looked, the Dagoes cooked :
They made the haloes, bowls:
The imps rejoic’d in frying oyst’
On grids designed for souls.
They snared the kicking comets gay
As through the sky they whizzed.
And stewed them in the Milky Way
And served them while they fizzed.
And ere my joyful dream had end
I saw all present sit
To such a feast I think would send
A wowser in a fit —•
A festive spread by wrath unbanned
Amid the smiling skies,
That day the Judgment-Dagoes planned
The Cafe Paradise !
VICTORIA.
AUGSTUS BLOWFLY.
The Son of an Earl
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"T S your mistress in?” inquired the man
with the flowing beard in sonorous
tones.
The startled maid nodded. “Yessir. I’ll
go an’ tell her. Will yer come inside, please?”
The man with the flowing beard stepped
into the hall, and thence into the stuffy
drawing-room, where he found a temporary
resting-place on a remarkably flimsy chair.
The startled maid shut the door with a bang,
fled upstairs and banged another door. Dead
silence reigned for about five minutes. Sud-
denly the door upstairs opened, and the loud
swish of an approaching silk dress became
audible. The man-in-waiting caressed his
curtain of whiskers thoughtfully and cleared
his throat. Then the magnificent landlady-
swept in, and he rose and bowed in his Old
World way.
“Good-morning, ma’am,” he said. I have
called about the rooms advertised in this
morning’s Herald.”
The severe, bony woman showed her gold-
stopped teeth and looked at him through her
rimless eyeglasses. “Oh, indeed !” she mur-
mured as though the subject were rather dis-
tasteful to her.
“My name is Bodger,” boomed the new-
comer, importantly. “I am just now quar-
tered in a city hotel, but I want to get away
from it —that is, providing I can get suitable
rooms.”
The landlady nodded stiffly.
Bodger thrilled with admiration. “A
gentlewoman, by Gad!” he muttered under
his breath. “Well, ma’am, I saw your ad-
vertisement this morning, and I thought I
would take a run out and have a look at the
room.”
The landlady rose. “Will you come this
way, please,” she said in her below-zero
manner, and swept before him down the
hall and up the dark staircase.
Bodger, utterly charmed, followed closely.
“A lady, by Gad,” he kept muttering. “None
of your frowsy boardinghouse-keepers this
time ! I’ll wager she knows what’s what!
Must have been a fine figure of a woman
once! Knows how to dress, too, by the
Lord ! I like her ! I like her pride, damme
if I don’t!”
Bodger was charmed with the room, and
the view it commanded, and said so several
times. He hardly winced at all when the
landlady mentioned her terms, and he waited
with impatience whilst she haughtily ex-
plained who the neighboring “guests” were.
“In the room above is Mr. Bicker; he is in
the Post Office. The room next to this is
occupied by Mr. Dodd-Garstead. He is a
perfect gentleman —you will like him im-
mensely. I believe he is the second son of
the Earl of Grousemoor. A charming young
man.”
That settled Bodger.
That afternoon, about four, he alighted
from a cab and stood by whilst the small,
red-haired driver grappled with his heavy
baggage like an undersized but very tierce
and determined bulldog ant with a set of
dice. Bodger made no attempt to assist
him, but merely superintended, and told him
at intervals to be careful. Finally, when
the immense business had been completed,
and the abject, perspiring man came cring-
ing for his tip, he insulted him by pressing
into his hand the exact amount of his fare.
The cabman held the shilling in his palm
for a minute as if it were a curious sort of
grub. Then he spat viciously on the pave-
ment and crammed the coin into his ragged
vest pocket. “Ah, well,” he sneered. “I
suppose you’re on the road to the blank.v
Benevolent Asylum like meself!”
“That’ll do!” roared Bodger, furiously.
“That’ll do you !”
“Oh. it'll do all right!” retorted the cab-
man as he untied the reins. “I didn’t know
you was an old-age pensioner when you
engaged me. GIDDAP. THERE!” The
cut of the whin made the tired horse bound
forward, and the lattle of the wheels drowned
A PASTORAL.
Bcdger’s furious but empty threat to report
him.
When at length he turned to the house he
beheld the frigid landlady awaiting him at
the threshold.
He advanced hurriedly. “Good evening,
ma’am,” he boomed. “Did you hear me
threaten that scoundrel? I gave him a
shilling, and the blackguard started to give
me impudence!”
The landlady elevated her carefully-pen-
cilled eyebrows and drew aside her absurdly
expensive skirts. “A shilling!” she echoed
languidly. “Mr. Dodd-Garstead usually
gives his cabman tioo.”
Bodger flushed with annoyance. “We are
not all sons of earls, ma’am!” he boomed,
reprovingly.
Until live o’clock he busied himself un-
packing his boxes and fixing up the room.
Then he made his toilet, and sat down in
the wicker chair before the window to read
until tea-time.
Sounds of dreadful preparations for dinner
floated up the stairs. Water rushed ; pot-lids
clattered; steak sizzled ferociously; slip-
pered feet rushed distractedly to and fro;
two women —evidently the maid and the
cook —gossiped and wrangled shrilly; and
the back door banged without cessation. The
new boarder listened Curiously to it all and
stroked his flowing beard.
“Has Mr. Dodd-Garstead come home yet?”
called the landlady from some cavern or
other.
The maid came charging from the kitchen.
“Not yet!” she sq,ualled, and fled back to
her steamy lair like the primeval savage she
was.
“Oh. dear! How provoking!” cried the
landlady, and took cover again.
Bodger looked sourly over his spectacles
at the half-open door of his room. “I won-
der what this d —d fellow is like?” he mut-
tered jealously, and turned for consolation
to the leading article.
A scrap of dangerously-loud kitchen gossip
by the cook blew in the window : “ paint-
in’ herself up like a Red Injin she is, an’
turnin’ up her nose worse than ever at the
boarders she gets her livin’ by, just because
this ’ere Dodd —what-yer-may-call-um ’as
come to stay in ’er ’ouse! W’y don’t she
’ave some sense an’ buy decent food for ’er
boarders, instead of stickin’ it all on her
back, an’ flyin’ round as if she ’ad ten thou-
sand a year? All I can say is I ’ope I may
’ave more sense when I’m ’er age. D’ye
know what she says to me last night? She
comes down and”— —• (Here the back door
banged viciously for the 987th time, and cut
the torrent of speech off.)
The clash of the iron front gate and the
sound of a Yale key thrust into the hall-door
lock happened in quick succession. The door
opened explosively and shut. A stick was
dropped carelessly into the hallstand, and
a cheery, masculine voice cried, “I say,
Jessie, any letters for me?”
There was a diversion in the kitchen, and
the maid with the prehistoric manners gal-
loped forth. “Not to-day, Mr. Dodd-Gar-
stead!” she shrieked.
A first-floor door opened hurriedly. “So
there you are at last!” cooed the landlady.
“Yes,” muttered the unreasonable Bodger
grimly, “there he is, confound him !”
“Plere I am !” sighed the aristocratic Dodd-
Garstead, plodding wearily up the stairs.
“IPad a perfectly rotten day. Only backed
one winner.”
“Oh, you dissipated young man ! Lost all
your money, I suppose?”
“Nearly all,” sighed the returned race-
goer. “I say, how well you’re looking to-
night !”
“Now, now!”
Bodger, very red in the face, cleared his
throat violently to apprise them that the
door was open. “What d —d nonsense! he
growled.
“I want to introduce you to our new
guest,’’ said the landlady very loudly, after
an interval of whispering. “Are you there.
Mr. Bodger?” . .
“Here, ma’am,” replied Bodger, rising and
going to the door.
The landlady, almost thawed out of her
usual icy state by the proximity of the future
peer, cooed graciously. “Mr. Dodd-Garstead
—Mr. Bodger.” . ,
“Glad to meet yon. sir!” cheerily cried
Dodd-Garstead, seizing and wringing Bod-
ger’s plump hand. “We must have a yarn
later on.” . „ , , „ ,
“I shall be delighted, sir,” boomed Bod-
ger. “This is a very great pleasure.” He
looked the rather hard-faced young man in
the eye and decided that lie liked him. His
unaffected manner and his frank greeting
had completely won him over. But he
almost hurst with gratification when the
landlady said sweetly to Dodd-Garstead.
“Perhaps Mr. Bodger would care to join US
at dinner to-night?” ~ „ ,
“I would be delighted, ma’am, said Bod-
ger promptly.
“That’s right,” cried Dodd-Garstead, pat-
ting him on the back in the friendliest pos-
sible way. Then, with a look at his watch,
“By George! We have just twenty min-
utes to dress in !” .
“I must run!” cried the landlady in mock-
alarm. “An revoir for the present, and
don’t be late, or I shall be very angry with
both of you!” Smiling inanely, she rustled
and jingled away—all silks and bangles. A
weary homing boarder passed her in the
hall and gave her a sulky “Good night.” She
answered him coldly and clutched up her
deafening silks. The boarder sprang past
her up the stairs like a circus tiger return-
ing to its cage. , . ,
As Bodger brushed his hair and crammed
his shirt-front inside the edges of Ins vest,
he heard more returning boarders clattering
in from the train and hurrying upstairs. The
hot kitchen smells miffed fiercely through
the house ; bedroom doors opened and shut;
bathwater flowed in torrents ; scraps of loud,
careless corridor talk rang through the
house; on the floor below someone alternately
sang bits of an old song and grumbled in an
undertone ; overhead a slow, deliberate man
paced to and fro in squeaky boots.
Suddenly there was a rush of slippered feet
in the hall below and a bell of railway, sta-
tion dimensions rang wildly and deafeningly
as though summoning the dregs of a sinful
world to a last hurried meal before the
official start to Eternity. The bell-ringing
before meals was the only one of her duties
in which the prehistoric maid took a de-
liglit. ,
At the first wild note room doors opened
everywhere, and boarders began to pour
themselves downstairs at an amazing rate.
It was as though the jangle of the bell had
cut the moorings of a human avalanche.
“Ready, old man?” shouted the cheery
Dodd-Garstead.
A STRAIGHT ANSWER.
MISS PARVENUE : “I heard that Smythe crea-
ture say that you hadn't the manners of a
pig, Ma.”
MRS. P.: “And what did you say?”
MiSS P.: “Of course, I was very annoyed,
and I told her straight that you had."
“Right you are!” returned Bodger some-
what reluctantly. The dress clothes (he had
not worn them for years) made him feel
strange, and the crowded house appalled him.
“Gome on then,” said his guide, appear-
ing at the door.
Dodd-Garstead led the way gaily down the
stairs and along a windy corridor; and Bod-
ger—an awesome figure with his divided
whiskers blowing back over his shoulders
tramped along behind struggling with his
protruding cuffs.
At the end of a passage was a door. This
Dodd-Garstead opened. He politely stood
aside as Bodger walked in and found some 40
odd hostile people staring and buzzing at
him. High above the murmur of critical
asid P s, came the comment of a fat, discon-
tented-looking clerk at a corner table. Ilaii !
Hair!” he squeaked. . , . - ,
“Whiskers, you mean! retorted ms
low-bounder, amidst a general snigger.
Bodger went purple. “I’ll that
cub!” he hissed. , , ~ a
“No! Kick him instead when jou ve got
some time to spare!” answered th< ;
son of the earl, catching him by the aim
and hurrying him through to the fuithe
apartment, where the landlady, m full eve
ing dress, sat smiling cheerlessly at her
pallid daughter, another disdainful female
and a peppery-looking little man in a Beau-
fort coat. The dishes were already on the
table, so the formal introductions were
rushed, and the meal proceeded amidst tht.
usual boarding-house meal-time clatter.
The envenomed comments of the ravenous
boarders in the next room, regarding tie
food, the administration generally, and the
landlady’s absurdly expensive dresses were,
at intervals, startlingly clear and distinct,
but, to Bodger’s astonishment, the woman
took not the slightest notice of them, except
to smirk and remark sorrowfully that
guests were such a bother always gium-
bling, you know.”
“Can’t I have any more pudding/ de-
manded an angry female voice in the dining-
room without. ~
(“Listen to this!” whispered Dodd-Gar-
stead.) . . ,
The prehistoric maid-in-waiting ceased
leaping about for a moment to answei.
“No, Miss Doonan; there ain’t another bit
left!” , , ~
“Good Heavens ! What on earth does the
woman expect us to live on?”
“I dunno! Everythin’ is oft now. A
new fur come home to-day.”
Smothered but perfectly audible screams
of rage went up from all females present.
The maid laughed triumphantly and cantered
out to the kitchen.
“Well, I call that positively dishonest!”
proclaimed the wretched woman who had
had to do without a second helping of pud-
ding. Loud murmurs of sympathy were
heard above the noise of chairs being drawn
out.
Bodger almost stove in his front upper
teeth with his pudding spoon, so intent was
he on watching the landlady’s perfectly ex-
pressionless features beneath the coating of
face-powder.
She caught his wild, questioning look and
smiled foolishly. “Guests are dreadfully
hard to please, Mr. Bodger,” she murmured.
The meal concluded, and Dodd-Garstead
piloted Bodger past groups of curious lodgers
to his room, and produced a box of very
good cigars, a decanter and a syphon.
The room was full of blue tobacco smoke
and good fellowship when there came a loud
knock at the door.
“Come in!” shouted Dodd-Garstead over
his shoulder.
It was Jessie, the prehistoric maid, with
the water-bottle.
“I could ’ave robbed yer ter-day, Mr.
Dodd-Garstead,” she said. “That there ter-
baccer jar was knocked over when we was
dustin’. It took me an’ Annie ’arf an hour
to pick up the sove-
reigns and ’arf-sove-
reigns that fell outer
it. W’y don't yer put
’em .in the bank?
They’d be safer there.”
Dodd - Gar stead
started unmistakably
at the news. “Thanks,
Jessie,” he said; “it
was good of you to
take the trouble.”
“Why do you keep
so much money in
your room ?” asked
Bodger.
“It is foolish. I
know; but going to
the bank every day or
so is a bother, so I
always keep a supply
here during race-
times. By-the-way,
Bodger, are you doing
anything particular
to-morrow?”
Bodger carelessly
flicked the ash from
his cigar. “No, I’ve
nothing on.”
“Well, what do you
say to a day at the
races—at my expense,
of course?”
Bodger had not
been on a course since
be was a boy. and the
novel idea appealed to
him strongly. Three
whiskies and two
cigars made him feel
that he had known
Dodd - Garstead for
years. He accepted
the invitation with
enthusiasm and sol-
emnly watched his
host refill his glass
without a protesting
word, although he
knew quite well that
his limit was three.
At 11.45 he parted regretfully from Dodd-
Garstead, and stumbled rather heavily along
the dark and silent lobby to his room. He
was charmed with Dodd-Garstead. He had
found him utterly free from “side.” and.
when he had endeavored to draw him out
about his father the earl and home affairs
generally the young man had gently changed
(he subject. “A d —d fine fellow !” fiercely
muttered Bodger, ere he blew 7 out the candle.
“A gentleman, every inch of him!”
Shortly afterwards he was snoring.
It was some gruesome time in the waste
hours of the night when Bodger became
dimly conscious that someone close, handy
was talking in his sleep. The voice was
old and fruity and toothless. Over and
over again, the unseen sleeper smacked his
lips with relish, and exclaimed “Thank God
for a good dinner!” Then, after a pause
would come a sly chuckle and the words, “Ah.
well! I suppose I’m a greedy rascal! —a
greedy rascal!”
The thanksgiving formula, repeated again
and again, gradually brought Bodger. wide-
awake and staring, to a. sitting position in
the strange bed. “What d —d old glutton
is that?” he asked himself, and tried to
locate the voice. He felt extremely hungry
and the food-choked utterance of the sleeper


was a snecies of mild torture.
“Thank God for a good dinner !” muttered
♦he voice for about the five-hundredth time.
Bodger threw back the clothes and got
out of his warm bed.
“Ah, well! I suppose I’m a greedy ras-
cal —a greedy rascal!”
Bodger stamped furiously on the floor.
“SHUT’ UP!” he yelled, and his voice seemed
to ring through the darkened house.
There was a faint tapping on the wall, and
an old, quavering voice called faintly, “It’s
only the parrot, sir; he ''"ill keep on imi-
tating my poor, dear husband—he always
used to say that after he had had his din-
ner.”
“All right, ma’am ! All right!” grumbled
Bodger, and felt his way back to bed. “This
d —d place is full of noises,” he muttered, as
he coiled the blankets about him once more.
At 11.30 next morning Dodd-Garstead
bore him off and steered him into the best
eating-place in town. The lunch was first-
class and the whisky sufficiently numerous to
make Bodger feel that the world belonged to
him and was full of paying tenants. It
would have been difficult to find a more satis-
fied man than he when Dodd-Garstead directed
the driver of the taxi they found waiting
outside to drive direct to the course. They
sued smoothly through the balmy spring
breeze to the open spaces beyond the city,
and switch-backed gaily over the hill roads
towards the green plain, where lay the spaci-
ous course, already well-sneckled with the
tiny, slow-moving units of a big crowd.
Bodger puffed proudly at his cigar. “I am
enjoying this immensely,” he remarked.
“That’s good,” replied his cheery host.
“By the way, did you hear old Mrs. Russell’s
parrot last night?”
“Yes, I did ! It made me get out of bed."
“The old lady,” explained Dodd-Garstead.
“is the landlady’s stepmother or something.
She is 92 and bedridden. The parrot is over
100 years old sometimes talks all night.
I’m afraid that’s why she gave you that room
—you can hear it very plainly from there.”
At this revelation Bodger made some
heated reference to "that d —d old witch,”
and chalked up another score against the
landlady. Five minutes later they were at
the course gates. The first race was due to
start in a quarter of an hour ; and as Dodd-
Garstead was anxious to make a bet they
hurried along to where the bookmakers were
making a hideous babel under the trees.
Before they plunged into the crowd, how-
ever. Dodd-Garstead drew Bodger aside.
“Look, old man,” he confided; “I’ve got a
big sum in gold on me, and I don’t want
to mix with the crowd, as the place is thick
with pickpockets. Would you mind making
my bets for me?”
“Certainly, my dear sir!” exclaimed Bod-
ger.
Dodd-Garstead pressed a sovereign into his
palm. “Put five bob on Blue Fit with that
big, dark bookie. He’ll give you the ticket
and 15 shillings. I’ll wait here for you.”
Bodger went off jauntily, made the bet. and
returned with the ticket and a handful of
silver.
Dodd-Garstead gaily dropped the coins into
his trousers pocket and stuck the ticket in
his vest.. “That silver stays with me, Bod-
ger ;it is part of my little system. You
see, I make a five-shilling bet with every
sovereign and hang on to the change. I find
it is a good automatic check. Now, do you
feel equal to making another bet?”
“W'*h pleasure,” said Bodger very hear-
tily ; and, being entrusted with another
sovereign, he went off at the direction of
Dodd-Garstead to a stout, fussy little Jew
and backed Blue Fit again.
When he got back with the ticket and the
money his host seemed to be a trifle uneasy
about something. As he took over the
change and the coins, he whispered: “Do
you see that clean-shaven man with his
hands in his pockets? Don’t stare too hard
at him.”
Bodger took a cautious survey.
“One of the smartest spielers in the
State!” continued Dodd-Garstead. “Don’t
let him get too close to you ! The countri-
fied-looking chap next him is his pal. We
want to keep clear of them. Let’s go along
a bit.”
Bodger, inwardly boiling to think that
such blackguards should be allowed to haunt
places frequented by moneyed sportsmen,
accompanied his host, and, when at a suffi-
ciently safe distance from the bandits, made
two more five-shilling bets on his behalf.
After that they strolled along to the stand,
and had the pleasure of seeing Blue Fit
beaten on the post by Apoplexy, after a tre-
mendously exciting finish.
GOING THE PACE.
Hoarse with shouting “Bravo!” Bodger
turned to condole with his host, and found
him sweetly smiling.
“Never mind, old man!” he cried, and
slapped his disappointed guest on the
shoulder. “I think I know something for
the next race. Come along and let us get on
early.” As they walked towards the betting
enclosure he took the worthless Blue Fit
tickets from his vest pocket and tore them
up into little fragments, which he dropped
on the path.
On the next three races Dodd-Garstead
won ; and he insisted on Bodger keeping two
of the sovereigns he brought back from the
bookmakers. (Bodger remembered that later
on.)
“Now, old man, I think we’ll see what we
can do for ourselves on the next race, and
then make a break for home. If we stay
tor the last we’ll be late getting back to
town, and I’ve booked a couple of seats for
the theatre to-night. I think Scout will
about pull this off. See if you can get fives
about him anywhere.”
Bodger went off. sampled the market and
round nothing better than threes on offer.
He was returning to make this report when
he noticed Dodd-Garstead walking rapidly
away He hailed him; but his host con-
tinued walking. Bodger ran after him
and started to explain breathlessly. “I
couldn t get” he began.
Dodd-Garstead stopped, took out his watch
and sa'd very loudly: “It’s exactly ten past
five . Then he walked on again.
Bodger flushed with annoyance and started
after him once more. “I didn’t ask you the
tune ! I wanted to tell you”-
. NO' I really don’t know what wi’l win
i , , e astounding Dodd-Garstead over
ms shoulder.
Bodger attacked him with a sort of breath-
less ferocity. “Look here, mv friend' If
this is a joke, it’s a d—d bad one! Whv
can t you Then lie noticed that Dodd-
Garstead was talking rapidly at him out of
the side of his mouth. “Shut up and pre-
tend you don’t know me! Go out that gate
to the right and I’ll pick you up in a minute.
lie quick!”
Bodger, utterly dumbfounded, obeyed his
orders implicitly. Like a man in a bad
dream he walked out by the little gate and
found himself on the main road. Within
T^ e ji m A nute le calculated afterwards that
Dodd-Garstead must have run after leaving
him) the taxi rolled along.
“Look sharp!” cried Dodd-Garstead. Full
of resentment at being ordered about without
ceremony, Bodger climbed in. Immediately
the taxi whirled off down the crowded road.*
“May I inquire what all this hurry is
about?” commenced Bodger gloomily. A
succession of heavy jolts as the taxi' passed
over a bad patch of roadway knocked his
belltopper off and flung his knobby stick on
the floor.
When he had put his hat on straight and
nicked up his stick he noticed that Dodd-
Garstead was staring anxiously out of the
window.
“What is the necessity for all this con-
founded mystery and hurry?” he demanded
heatedly.
A BAD EXAMPLE.
IST SPAGGER (to 2nd ditto): “My poo[?] father
lost his life trying that."
“I don’t want to be robbed!” muttered
Dodd-Garstead without turning round.
“Robbed !” echoed Bodger hoarsely.
The taxi flew up an unwatered hill, leav-
ing an impenetrable cloud of dust like thick
smoke in its wake.
Dodd-Garstead dropped into his seat and
mopped his brow. “I reckon we’re safe
now,” he muttered. “Didn’t you notice those
two spielers following you?”
A light—a very dim light indeed—broke in
on Bodger’s vast intellect for a brief
moment. Then all grew dark again. “But
surely the scoundrels
wouldn’t dare to attack
us in broad daylight!” he
roared.
Instead of answering,
Dodd-Garstead put his
head out the window and
shouted at the driver,
“Go round by the Park
Lake—as fast as you
can !”
The driver nodded;
and the taxi, gaining
level ground, flew on
faster than ever.
Bodger sat staring and
muttering angrily.
The taxi swung sharply
round a corner. Dodd-
Garstead swayed over,
and, catching Bodger by
the shoulder to steady
himself, asked without the
trace of a smile, “If I drop you at a town
barber _s will you have a clean shave?”
Bodger glared at him for one awful min-
ute and half-raised his stick. Then he
thumped the floor of the vehicle with the
immense waddy and yelled, “You’re nothing
but a damned insulting blackguard, sir!
It I were a younger man I’d flog you within
an inch of your life !”
All right, then ! Have it your own way!”
retorted Dodd-Garstead bitterly, and started
to rapidly extract bright new sovereigns from
his right-hand vest pocket.
Bodger, half-crazed with passion, sat star-
ing and muttering in his seat. Scraps of
brokem speech fell from his mouth like
crumbs. Man s mad !. . . .Too much betting
upset his brain Lock me up between a
parrot and a lunatic, will she. the old witch!
.... I won’t stand it, d—d if I will!”
Meanwhile Dodd-Garstead occupied him-
self with his gold; the taxi whirled on to-
OFF AND ON.
“I Have nevah been quite able to disquiminate
between a buck and a pig-woot. ”
"It's quite easy. If you're ridin the cuddy it's
a buck. If the other cove's ridin ’ it’s
only a pig-root .”
wads the park; and the dust-storm—the
advance guard of the approaching southerly
gale raced towards them down the long
road.
As the cab fled through the big white
gates Dodd-Garstead let down the window.
“Drive close as you can to the lake!” he
cried, and the driver nodded again. As the
thing swerved in towards the ornamental
sheet of water Dodd-Garstead lifted the
hand in which he held the sovereigns and
flung them through the window ! They made
little splashes amongst the rushes.
“Having mad, by the Lord Harrv!”
gasped Bodger, edging further away and
taking a firmer grip of his enormous stick.
Now Myrtle Avenue as fast as you can!”
shouted the madman. The driver nodded
once more, and the taxi raced for the hoard-
ing-house through the gathering storm. It
was a brief journey at that tremendous pace,
but not too brief for Bodger, whose heart
gave a joyous leap when the vehicle fled up
the hill towards the corner of the Avenue.
t-> before they reached the corner
Dodd-Garstead jumped up and shouted,
btop here and wait for me!” The thing
came to a sudden halt. Dodd-Garstead
opened the door and jumped out without
ceremony. Bodger hurriedly followed, and
was amazed to see his crazy host run to the
corner and peep round it.
. “What’s the matter with you?” he roared
in nervous anger.
Dodd-Garstead made no reply j lie merely
ran back to the taxi, hopped in and slammed
the door. “To the railway station! Go like
11—i. he told the mystified but obedient
driver. The taxi grunted, turned in its
own length, and sped away down the hill,
leaving the usual trail of dust behind it
Bodger, holding his belltopper on in the
terrific wind, stared angrily over his stream-
ing whiskers at the retreating vehicle “Mad
as a March hare!” lie breathed. “I’ll lock
my door to-night! I can’t go looking for a
new place till the morning. But I’ll not be
murdered in my sleep by a madman! I sup-
pose he’ll come back some time.” Then he
turned, and. with his head bowed, fought
his way against the wind towards the house,
before which another taxi was standing.
The door opened instantly to his knock.
f 1 e stumbled into_ the gloomy hall and found
it filled with excited lodgers and a dreadful
smell of gas.
_ “Here’s Mr. Bodger!” shrieked the pre-
historic maid above the tumult.
Amid the usual swish of silk, the land-
lady came hurriedly forward. “Oh, a dread-
ful thing has happened, Mr. Bodger,” she
began -tremulously. But a tall form, with a
muttered apology, stepped in front of her,
and addressing Bodger sternly said, “Where
did you leave Slippery Jack?”
“What do you mean, you scoundrel?”
roared Bodger, retreating a step.
“That’ll do!” commanded the tall man
sharply. “It’s no use trying to bluff. Where
did you leave him? We’ve been waiting
here for you.”
Bodger turned to the landlady. “Who is
this blackguard?” he demanded.
“A detective !” moaned the landlady. “He
says Mr. Dodd-Garstead is”
“We want him for passing spurious coin,”
snapped the detective. “You were out at
the races with him and went away with him
in a taxi. Where did you leave him?” He
came closer to Bodger, and Bodger recog-
nised him as the tall dark spieler Dodd-
Garstead had warned him against.
Chattering with rage, he shook his fist in
the Law’s face. “Don’t you dare to accuse
me of being a confederate of this man’s ! I
only met the blackguard last night in this
house! He took me to the races and got
me to make his d—d bets for him, because
he said you would try to pick his pocket if
he got mixed up in the crowd ! (Don’t
laugh at me, confound you! I won’t be
laughed at!) He hurried me off the course
like a child, pitched his money into the lake
on the way home, and went like the Devil to
the railway station as soon as he saw that
cab of yours at the street door. That’s all I
know about it!” Bodger puffed out his
cheeks and glared about him at the awe-
struck, shadowy lodgers.
“He’s gone for the express,” said the de-
tective to a brother officer in the shadow.
“You’d better get down to the station with
Mac. If he keeps to that line, we’ll get him.
I’ll have a look through his room and follow
you with Hamlin. Send up another taxi as
you pass the rank.” Two men shouldered
their way through the press. The front door
was opened and slammed to. Outside the
taxi thudded excitedly, grated its gear-wheels
savagely and was gone.
“Light something, can’t you?” roared
Bodger wildly above the noises of the storm.
There was a chorus of protesting screams.
“The gas is escaping!” intoned the .land-
lady. “We are frightened to light any-
thing! We think Mr. Dodd-Garstead cut
the pipe somewhere.”
“I must search that room,” said the detec-
tive fretfully. “Whereabouts is it?”
Bcdger fiung his hat and stick on the hall-
stand like a man
who intended to
sacrifice his life.
“Come on!” he
boomed. “I’ll show
you !”
With the detec-
tive at his heels
he was making
for the stairs,
when a dim, un-
tidy figure the
prehistoric maid —
fought its way to
the bottom step and started to give the
usual evening bell-ringing performance.
Cries of indignation went up from the
assembled boarders. The distraught land-
lady surged forward and made frantic signs
for silence. “What does this mean f” she
demanded hysterically, when the brief but
tremendous performance was concluded.
“Means that dinner’s ready !” squalled the
simple, primitive woman, amazed at the
query.
“This is no time for bell-ringing !” cried
the landlady tragically. The horrified maid
fled with her tocsin to the dark and steamy
kitchen.
Some brave soul ventured to light one jet
in the dining-room. The dishes began to
arrive, and the boarders, taking courage,
streamed into the cheerless vault to eat.
Bodger led the stumbling detective up-
stairs and felt his way along the landing to
a point opposite Dodd-On rstead’s door. “This
is the blackguard’s room.” lie boomed. “The
smell of gas doesn’t seem to be so, bad here.
I’ll open the door.” He groped for the
handle, opened the door, stepped forward—
and fell with a crash over a sharp-edged
box. The suspicious detective thought that
it was a trick, and recklessly struck
the match he had ready in his hand.
There was a dull boom, a blinding flash,
and he was thrown violently on his back.
* * * *
Bodger, prone on his face beneath a pile
of rugs, dreamt that he heard afar the rush-
ing of many waters and . the screams of
people drowning. A lunatic on the bank
was screaming his thanks to God for a good
dinner, and adding in the same breath that
he was a greedy rascal. Gradually, as the
shock wore off, he recognised that the sounds
he heard were right beneath him. It
was not water that was rushing—it was
plaster ; the shrieks were being supplied by
the boarders ; the lunatic was the old lady’s
parrot.
Throwing off his wrappings, he crawled
wonderingly towards an irregular patch of
light in the centre of the floor. He got
right to the verge before he realised with a
shock that the lighted patch was really a
gaping hole in the floor made by the explo-
sion. Dragged forward by curiosity, he
looked over the splintered edge into a well
illuminated by one candle and filled with
plaster-covered boarders, all shrieking round
a table heaped high with rubbish. Immediately
beneath him the prehistoric maid was stand-
ing like a statue, holding a dish of Irish
stew and plaster, into which, from some
wrecked hiding-place in the ceiling, bright
counterfeit sovereigns were dropping one by
one.
“Look at th’ munney droppin’ in th’ stoo!”
screamed the simple serving-woman, in
alarm. “A forchin-teller told me larst week
that I was goin’ to come in for munney !”
Bodger suddenly remembered the sove-
reigns Dodd-Garstead had given him. In
panic haste, lest they too should be counter-
feit, he extracted them from his pocket, and,
taking careful aim, dropped them deliberately
into the dish.
“What are you doing, Mr. Bodger?”
The landlady, with her complexion lop-
sided and her costume a mass of dust, stood
erect in the midst of desolation, and pointed
an accusing finger at the ceiling.
“Nothing!” roared Bodger.
“What’s that?” demanded an authorita-
tive voice below. The second detective be-
came visible.
The weeping landlady collapsed into her
chair and feebly indicated the face in the
ceiling. “I distinctly saw him throw some
coins into the stew !” she wailed.
“I want that stew!” said the detective
roughly, and took it from the living statue.
Bodger, without any apparent effort, slid
suddenly out of view of those below.
“Someone must have pulled his leg!” cried
an excited woman, who was a school-teacher
by profession and never used slang on any
account.
“It was the other detective,” remarked
a bald man hollowly, as a furious altercation
commenced above. “He’s arresting him for
dropping money in the stew!”
The prehistoric maid burst into a torrent
of tears. “I’m goin’ to leave!” she sobbed.
“I made that stoo with me own hands, and
everybody’s been throwin’ rubbish and bad
money in it, an’ now ’e went an’ arrested
it outer me ’ands! I’m re-spectable, an’
I’m not goin’ to stand it!”
A deafening clap of thunder drowned the
landlady’s voice as she strove to order the
maid to retreat on the kitchen. The detec-
tive wrenched a spoon out of the mass of
plaster on the table and started to dredge
sovereigns out of the stew. The plaster-
covered boarders watched him breathlessly
for a while, and listened to the thunder and
the row upstairs. Then, one by one. they
arose and made their wav over the rubbish
to the drawing-room, where a white-faced,
trembling girl was mechanically pounding
out the Merry Widow waltz, which is the
boarding-house Marseillaise and Te Deum
the whole world over. It was a grimly-
mechanieal performance spattered with
wrong notes and collisions of all' kinds, but
it seemed to fit the circumstances as well
as anything could, and they listened to it in
reverential silence.

STRAY RHYMES
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Bride.
NOTHING except the knocking of my
heart
And your slow breathing, in this room
apart!
Faint sounds, like steps on velvet, come and
go,
Strange shadows crowd within the portico,
And you lie, sleeping, close to me, your
bride
Half-risen from the pillow at your side.
You, who a handsbreadtli from me lie so
still,
Why should my heart cry out, who have my
will,
Or mourn because you came—though late—
to me
Whose love had sought you long and fixedly?
Why should I loose the fountain of my tears
For your past loves and empty-pleasured
years ?
What gain to probe and pry, and find, per-
chance,
The knowledge that is worse than igno-
rance?
Yet, if but one dear name of all your store
You had not said to any love before,
Or if I knew that any one caress
Had not been spent on some strange love-
liness
Of other time- —if I might only own
One phrase or title for myself alone,
I should sleep happier, nor clasp again
These taloned thoughts that tear my heart in
twain.
Could you not keep the fresh first love for
me
Whom, then, you had not met—your bride
to be?
A many loves, they tell me, you have known —
What would my love not give to have been
thrown
First of all loves across your path—and yet
Would I love truer if I could forget,
Or if your manhood, raw and wondering,
Came to my arms a white, unsullied thing?
I love you, knowing all! Is it not so,
Better than if I loved and did not know?
Are you not, now, all mine—the short, brown
hair
Thinning a little at the temples (where,
Staining the tan, one small blue vein
appears),
The thin, strong face, full throat, and close-
set ears,
The steady eyes beneath the lids’ eclipse,
The little laughter-lines about your lips,
One careless arm the covers thrust among,
Its fellow on the pillow loosely flung—
The hand palm upward—and the straight
limbs’ length,
The shoulders and the firm, lithe body’s
strength—-
Close-knit, yet as a woman’s white and fair —
That I have clothed with kisses everywhere,
The breath that lifts the light hair at my
hrow.. . .
All that is you—l have and hold you now!
Oh, heart of mine, beating so nearly still
For fear to waken him —you have your will
As I have mine! We hold him, you and I,
Heart, and shall hold him, so, until we die!
Naught may unmake the past. ’Tis better
so:
And yet if only, heart, I did not know!
VICTORIA.

Clover.
CLOSE the shutter and latch it over!'
But you cannot shut out the scent of
the clover,
The delicate, dusty scent of clover!
I was too much with the trees last night,
Pooled with shadow and patched with light,
Where the moonlight rippled the boughs be-
tween —
Too much with the frail, transparent green
And the dewy dusks of the lawns, spread
over
With summer snow of the blossoming clover!
Now it is the warm siesta hour;
Shut out the story of bee and flower,
Seek silken pillow and close your eyes
To the reeling sun in the thirsty skies,
Make night of the quiet, curtained room
To dupe coy sleep by a cozening gloom ;
Its cool white finger your eyes to cover,
But you cannot shut out the scent of the
clover,
The faint, far sweets of the calling clover!
I know the way that it rides the hill
White and sunny and never still,
Under the leaf-house of the trees
Musical with the many bees,
A woven mat on the brown earth flung,
I know what it is to couch among
The slight slow musks of those quivering
heads
To make your pillow of elfin beds;
The wind for piper, the sun for lover,
And your heart so near to the blossoming
clover!
By a fairy timepiece that never strikes
Have you tallied hours on the clover sjnkes?
Have you stretched at length to see the
swing
Of the bannered branches curtseying?
Have you tasted life from the lips of
Spring?
Have you seen the moon like a phantom
thing
Glide from the shroud of the cypress tree
When night has muffled the homing bee?
Oh! darken my room for shy sleep’s sake
(How should I sleep with the leaves awake?),
Close the shutter and latch it over,
But you cannot shut out the scent of the
clover,
The delicate, dusty scent of clover!

Curse Comprehensive of the
Dejected Bard.
I RISE to curse creation; but, soul sick. I
pause to call
Destruction on this hash-tower, where
wild boarders bounce and bawl.
I scorn their vulgar ways ; then heave a meta-
physic curse
At sundry atoms that compose this shabby
universe.
I curse it up, I curse it down, I curse it
everywhere,
(Like Jove I forge these thunderbolts upon
the topmost stair).
I blast this sordid suburb whither Fate has
ordered me,
While happier bards are fluting of the joys of
bush and sea.
At solemn politicians floating mighty loans I
jeer
(But damn the hash dame’s husband, who
steals forth once more for beer !).
I heave an oath of anger at the lost Austra-
lian nation,
And greet, with hollow laughter, Watt’s most
sober legislation.
I cast a rabbit of regret at wowsers dour and
old
Who desecrate this Sabbath day with dull-
ness manifold.
I deprecate the Judge’s saw who hoped that
after dark
Lamps indiscreet should burn above stray
lovers in the park.
No good I see in anything upon this planet
done,
The Will-to-Live receives hereby a heavy
malison.
To-day I tried surf-bathing, but on Bondi
beach alone
Lamented brown-limbed mermaids were to
browner blokes more prone.
Yet loathe I poets of the tomb who maunder
o’er their woes
(And, likewise, shallow optimists who grin
in verse and prose).
I scorn all sport, this foolish strife of bang-
ing ball and bat,
And useless information that is tick-taclced
from the Flat.
Anathemas I strew upon the Actor, prose and
rhyme,
The Waller Shakspeare, Music Halls, the
constant Pantomime.
I curse the union rate for art; and loudly I
lament
The ruin of the country and the trend of
government.
I blast and blight the squatter and the
cockie, here and now,
At every sheep I smile in scorn, and every
sacred cow.
I see no beauty in the bush, no pleasure in
the town.
Upon this sorry Scheme of Things I cast a
dismal frown.
The Principle of Evil reigns, so tribulations
troop.
A thorn there is to every rose, a fly in every
soup.
I look upon the rolling world through highest
attic pane
(Alas! the hash-dame’s man returns, and
falls downstairs again).
I curse two columns and a half, and seek to
curse some more,
Then curse the want of space, the staff, the
sub, and editor.
But I call down a blessing on the under-
taker’s head,
Because, when he arrives, such pests will all
be safely dead.

GANESHA.
Farewell to the Muse.
I’M sick of neat-clipped hedges,
I’m tired of walled-in places,
I yearn for ragged edges
And loose and larger spaces.
In distance’s abyss
My soul I must immerse.
Fact of the matter’s this :
I’m sick of writing verse.
I writhe in metre’s fetters:
The space is much too small;
These rows of capital letters
Are like a high brick wall.
And if I wish to stray
Beyond the path at times,
A fence runs all the way,
And all its posts are rhymes.
For all the hopes you utter,
And all the griefs sublime,
Must trickle down a gutter
Whose banks are bricked with rhyme.
You put within your book
Man’s dreams and man’s despairs
Between neat rhymes that look
Like rows of boots —in pairs.
My thoughts no more I’ll lop
To lines as short as these;
No kindlings more to chop—
I’m going to grow trees.
My Muse says (I endorse it)
She wants to put on wings.
She’s taking off her corset:
I’m letting out the strings.
I’ve kissed her, paid her wages;
She went, though she was cross.
In the advertising pages
She wants another boss.
Verse fills me with disgust.
Life calls me forth. Here goes!
I’m going on a bust —
A life-long bust of prose!

My Mentor.
I HAVE a friend —a pious, self-
Elected Mentor, he,
Who digs up maxims every day
And passes them to me.
He does not like the way I “live,”
He thinks I am not “nice” ;
So all the time he shadows me
And gives me good advice.
“Go, tell the truth—and you will shame
The Devil” —is his cry.
“Why should I give the Devil shame?
He knows not’shame,” say I !
“Sweet Virtue is its own reward,
You’ll learn this if you try”—
I hear his droning monotone,
And thus I make reply :
“If Virtue is its own reward,
Then it is plain to me,.
That capital amassed like this
Would make poor currency !”
“You are a hardened cynic, friend
(The world holds quite a few).
Do unto others as you would
That they should do to you.”
“ ’Tis good advice, dear friend,” I muse,
“And I would play the game
In this —if ‘others’ I were sure
Would also do the same.
“The debts due me I would forego
(They are exceeding small) ;
But oh ! my creditors are hard !
They will not bend at all!”
“Strong drink is raging, brother mine,
And wine a mocker is.
It would relieve me much to see
You meditate on this.”
“I do! I do! Tt stays with me,
Old pal, from day to day.
And, haunted thus—I take a nip
To drive the thought away !”
With aphorism, saw and text.
From copy-book and screed,
He lays siege to my every fault
In look, or word, or deed.
And thus my mentor striveth hard
To make me free from guile.
I listen to him much amused,
And he abhors my smile.
The world is like a bale of hay,
And we are donkeys all;
We eat our fill—then walk away
And leave the empty stall.
I have a mentor. He is tilled
With much religious flam ;
He throws me maxims every day
And makes me—what I am !

The Sick Room.
HERE in my narrow room
The lamp burns very low;
Doctor and nurse and priest
Go softly to and fro,
And their voices merge in a dream,
Decorous, smooth and low.
They have watched me night and day
With wonderful care, no doubt,
Thinking my wits too dim
To ferret their secret out;
Doctor and nurse —so bland,
And the priest with his air devout!
They think that I cannot see
Their thoughts are fixed on my purse;
The nurse is ogling the doctor,
And the priest leers at the nurse.
Hypocrites both the men,
And the woman is something worse!
Could I lift this weight from my chest,
I would bustle them off, all three,
Cursing the priestly cant
As I flung the doctor his fee.
And the woman I’d call by the name
That’s fitting for such as she.
But the weight grows heavier still. . ..
1 shall never say my say!
Dumbly facing the wall,
I must let them have their way !....
But I’ll have my fling at the three
When we meet on Judgment Day!

Love and the Legion.
A LITTLE while, and we labor; a little
while, and we die ;
So part your balcony’s roses, and look
at us marching by.
No soldier of all our legion, but knows of
the hope that flies.
No soldier of all our legion but tears have
dried in his eyes.
A long, long kiss in the twilight and Romeo’s
vows for you;
You dwell in a dreamland city. The legion
is marching through !
We have learnt that Honor’s password has
the countersign “Regret” ;
Go back to love and your roses. ’Tis best to
be Juliet.
The song of the roadway calls us —no love-
lilt sweet and low;
You do not know our marching-song, but
some day you shall know.
Yet down on the dusty highway, for the
sake of a girl he knew.
A man of the marching legion is blowing a
kiss to you.

Maiden Fears.
THE little lady on the train
Sat in her corner all alone,
But ere it started came a swain,
And took the corner facing Joan.
She shuddered when his face she saw,
Her simple heart beat painfully,
For, oh ! she knew with maiden awe
How wicked wicked men may be !
His brow was dark, his eyes were black
As princes in the fine romance ;
She looked no more, for men (alack!)
Presume upon a timid glance.
She felt his keen eyes cutting deep
Into her soul, and stilled a moan;
Then gave her heart one horrid leap
His foot had shifted near her own !
His eyes were wilder now. The fire
Of passion burned— foreboding what?
She thought she’d scream in terror dire,
And then she thought she’d better not.
She trembled where she sat. Her gaze
Was fixed upon a sky of grey.
His eyes she knew were just ablaze.
And still the train rushed on its way.
He moved again. A tiny cry
Escaped her lips in anguish grim.
She crouched low dojvu. Then chanced
an eye,
And awesomely she looked at him.
“Vulgarian !” scoffed the little maid.
His eyes were shut, his mouth would
keep
Wide open—snoring, I’m afraid —
For he had fallen fast asleep !

The Inventors.
RATHMOR made a flying spear
When the woods and we were young,
Barbed with copper, burnished clear,
From a leathern thong it swung—
Rathmor taught the world to fear
When the woods and we were young
Down the glen across the stream,
Where the tribesmen’s smoke arose,
Rathmor’s shaft with flying beam
Smote a terror through our foes—
Down the mosses of the stream
Terror crept upon our foes.
Carul taught a cord to sing
When the dimpled world was fair,
With its fitful murmuring
Loading all the summer air—
Carul taught a thong to sing.
Tickled with a bow of hair.
Up the rocks and through the glen
Carul’s music crept afar,
Smote upon the ears of men
Couching under pine and star —-
Carul’s music brought to men
Dreams of wonder blown afar.
Colgar taught a tree to plough
When the earth was soft with rain,
Scratched a sleepy valley’s brow,
Made the furrows rich with grain—
Colgar scratched a valley’s brow
When the land was soft with rain.
Up the coverts winding free
Huntsmen passed with hound and horn,
Threshing straw beneath his tree,
Colgar fed the world with corn—
Corn was good beneath his tree
While the huntsman wound his horn.
Rathmor, Carul. Colgar still
Ply their trades beneath the sun,
Spear and corn and music fill
All the space that man has won;
Flying spears upon the hill
Guard what plough and string have won.
Colgar makes a tree to plough,
Carul makes a thong to sing,
Rathmor bids the nations bow
To the shaft his hand can fling;
Carul bids the peoples fyow
When the plough and spear shaft sing!

Beginning well, like a sunny day.
you ended in a storm ;

And a dog you were and a waster, and a fiend

Nineteen-Fourteen! Like a baby reared on

You’d a smile at the beginning, and you
grew up like a knave.
Bad as women who talk Latin like a priest,
were you for mine,
And you cogged some friends of mine into
the grave.
Nineteen-Fourteen! You began, a glaring
morning,
And, about October, sent me up a tempest
from the Pole;
And I’m glad you lie a-dying. and your car-

And I’ll see you buried with the years, and
cast into a hole.
Nineteen-Fourteen, if I were not sure you’re

But, Nineteen-Fourteen, unless the dates are
You’re dying! and upon your fatted forehead

The Morals of a King.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MORALITY,” said the old gentleman,
rattling his dry little body in his
heavy black clothes, “is only com-
parative.”
He indicated from his penny chair the
long sweep of the beach where wholesome
semi-nudity basked in the sun and flung
white limbs amidst the suif. ,
“In places where I have been you couldn’t
do this. It would be considered wicked.
In those places virgins were used for the
foundations of houses, and wives were driven
in the shafts of ploughs.
“And the trouble is that people will im-
pose their own moral standards upon other
people. They court disaster. The ethics of
the Bast are not always worse than those of
the West. They are different. That is what
my wife could never understand.”
With his eyes on the far skyline he turned
over in his mind some opulent landscape of
his own apporting.
“It was a squalid place in the delta of a
muddy Asiatic river. A sultan lived there
—a fat and greedy man. His poets sang
him songs of the glories of his kingdom, his
hundred elephants and his shining virtues.
He had no elephants or virtues. He had 35
wives, a Prime Minister, a Controller of
Customs and an Admiral. The Controller
of Customs robbed all visitors from inland,
handing them over to the Prime Minister,
who handed them in turn to the Admiral;
the Admiral had first call on all strangers
from seaward; and the Sultan claimed a
commission from all three. The national flag
was a mingling of their four coats of arms,
like a patent for roguery. As for the rest
of his subjects, when they were not strong
enough to rob they begged.
“The foundations of his capital were built
on mud. When the dirty tide in the river,
like a shamefaced betrayer of fellow shame,
slunk away and left it bare, the houses hung
over the mud like broken and dismantled
trade oases stuck on stilts. That disgrace-
ful city was as old as anything in Europe.
It was old in sin. There were the marks of
thousands of tides, like disease, upon its
[tiles, that had rotted away and been re-
placed a hundred times. The water lapped
there with a listless sound. There were old
growths of lacustrine weeds and shellfish,
under the floors of the houses, that dripped
and writhed and fell, sometimes with the
sodden plank they clung to, into the river.
The low tide exposed the domestic debris of
countless generations floating on the mud,
that still considerately swallowed all it
could. Night, tide and mud cloaked a mul-
titude of evil in that so-decorous city.
“The Sultan’s palace toppled on broken
piles over a greater area than the other-
houses, looking like a wrecked and aban-
doned municipal baths. It had three tiers
of ragged roof, and his harem stood apart,
connected with his own apartments by a
bridge that swayed with a fearful motion to
the lurching of his heavy body when he
crossed it. We could hear in the evenings
from my shop on shore the dismal creaking
of the bridge as his unsteady feet essayed it
after a day of great potations—could hear
him stumble at the threshold and the loud,
momentary clamor of his voice and the sub-
missive answer from indoors.
“There was only one street on the dry
land, and mine was the only shop in it. The
street stretched a hundred yards along the
river, and ended in strange shapes of ooze
that looked like the spirits of the place
escaping to their element. The Sultan came
often to see us, the only white people in his
realm; rowing across on the full tide in his
State galley, with a mob of courtiers crowd-
ing in boats in his rear.”
A spasm of disgust animated the old man’s
form, as at the memory of an intolerable
offence offered upon his body.
“He used to sit there in our best chair,
amongst the bales of cotton goods and tinned
milk and rum barrels, and prod me with his
small and filmy eyes, wondering in his greedy
little mind how many more of the golden
eggs I might lay, or whether it were yet
time to kill me and take the lot. My wife
he would not look at. She had a stern and
uncompromising gaze that disconcerted him.
He would talk rudely and hastily in under-
tones to his immediate attendant, an old
and dull creature, who squatted at his feet,
the regalia between his knees. It was an
ancient, rusted blunderbuss, relic from some
ship his subjects had found wrecked upon
the coast. The shop would be dark and full
of shifting shadows. The light would come
in glints of bronze between crowding chin
and shoulder, elbowing arm and straining-
leg, of his ragged followers who swarmed
murmuring in the doorway; the bronze glints
would shoot across and touch the further
wall and be snatched warningly back again.
My wife and I would sit under the gaze of
all those eyes and look straight in the old
potentate’s face, as if the three of us were
alone and in interesting discourse. The
tumult of admiration caused by the advent
of royalty could be heard faintly in the
street outside.
“He could never make up his mind to kill
me. The urging of his advisers only made
him come more often to see us, to sit and
stare at me with his prodding, dubious glance
while his courtiers gazed and whispered at
the door. We were an institution in his
realm. The presence of a trading white man
added lustre to his reign. He liked the look
of my schooner riding occasionally at anchor
in the streets of his tumbledown city, and
throwing up her tall white spars amidst the
jumbled roofs like the protest of efficiency
against waste and corruption.
“When he' had extracted credit for an-
other barrel of flour, our conference was
ended, and he would get up to go, He
wotilu give me his damp and flaccid hand
in token of good faith, touch his heart and
his forehead gravely, and go out, the door-
way bursting suddenly into a blaze of sun-
shine as his followers made way for him.
Then they would gather tumultuously round
him as if he had been unexpectedly rescued
from assassination, and in a straggling group
the procession would move down to the
water’s edge, the blunderbuss swaying in
from and a ceremonial umbrella bowing be-
hind to show where the august head of the
squat little monarch pi’oceeded. The air
seemed fresher after he had gone.” .
Tfi P a moment, brushing over the
portals of his memory the dust of that con-
tamination. A soothing breath came off the
blue depths of the sea before us and stirred
the precise hairs of his beard, softly as if
stroking them.
I prospered in that dubious trade, where
hall my assets were bad debts and the other
halt the products of the forest. Each time
the schooner came I filled her with gums
and spices, pepper and copra. Every even-
ing I entered up a profit in my books, that
a sme h of aromatic barks and resin.
"My wife entirely disapproved. There
was some stiff Puritanic strain in her which
put her out of tune with those ingenuous
surroundings. She thought it wrong that
I should take the money of the heathen. She
watched on the river the boats of native
Romeos go. by, and heard the music of seren-
ading flutes arise to the lattices of pile-built
houses. She heard cries in the dark and
the voices of angry men, all the veiled
passion of the people wakening under the
cloak of night. She didn’t like their easy
marriage laws. She didn’t like the morals
of the king. The domestic villainy that went
on within his dingy palace walls upset her
peace of mind. She used to stand rigid in
the front of the shop and watch the old
sybarite waddling away from bis harem in
the middle of the day, and would wear a
look of disgust that obviously disturbed his
balance.
“She looked with scorn upon the native
women, who looked with equal scorn on
her, the shameless white wife who strode
about the street unveiled. She had been
seen, they whispered., in the arms of a white
man dancing one evening on the deck of the
schooner. Only outcast women danced.
She walked in the street level with her
husband, and ate at meals with him. Verily,
she was without shame. They snatched their
children out of her way and wrapped their
veils closer round their heads as she passed.
“The Sultan came less often to see me
now. He felt unhappy in the presence of
my wife. Lapped as he was in the adulation
of his people he could find no admiration
for his virtues in that gaunt face. Before
the awful reprobation of her eyes he dropped
his own.
“One day, after a joyful row in the
palace had announced the fact that the
King had taken a new bride, he brought a
girl, swathed in veils and headcoverings, to
see us. I was shipping copra at my wharf.
My wife received him. A few minutes later I
heard the tumult of his progress coming down
the street. It was more than usually voci-
ferous. The crowd of head's swayed and
tossed and the short top of the regalia reeled
in its midst like the stumps of a dismasted
ship.
“The crowd broke when it reached me, and
disclosed the Sultan walking in strange quiet-
ness, amongst all that hubbub, on trembling
legs, his slack chins wobbling on his chest.
A FOUL AND HIS FOLLY.
He came up close to me, and looked at me
sadly through sunken eyelids. ‘She says I
have no virtue,’ he mumbled like a man in
pain. Over his shoulder crowded the sweat-
ing, eager faces of his retinue, craning as
if to hear the vindication of the great King’s
character. ‘She says my actions are im-
moral,’ he repeated. I knew that the ‘she’
who had said these things was my wife.
“Behind him I saw the muffled shape of
his new bride, and the lights of her timid
eyes looked out from all her gaudy wrap-
pings like an appeal for succor.
“I had nothing to add to what my wife had
said. Like a pure and upright conscience
dogged in broad daylight by the ghost of out-
rageous scandal, the Sultan, followed by the
gaudy figure of his wife, turned and walked
slowly down to his boat.
“During the next few days we learnt the
Sultan’s majesty was sick. He lay all day in
his harem, brooding over the offence offered
to his dignity. The Court met and ex-
pressed its indignation.
People shouted from house
to house across the city the
news that the Sultan’s char-
acter had been attacked. It
was talked of between boats
upon the river. Boys came
and pointed out the actual
scene.
“Now the dignity of Asia-
tic kings is no abstraction.
It is an active spirit. Out-
raged, it becomes an angry
demon. It punishes the out-
spoken thoughts of faithless
courtiers with mysterious
maladies. It plucks out
presumptuous tongues. It
afflicts with blindness the
eyes of those who look with-
out due awe on the kingly
face. It curses with a
deadly skin disease the
commoner who dares to
marry with a woman of the royal blood.
“I suggested to my wife that it would be
as well if, when the schooner sailed on the
morrow, she went with it, returning when
the air had cleared a little. She refused
point blank. That scandalous old man
should never live to say that she had run
away from him.
“We went that evening on board the
schooner, where it was cooler and where the
mosquitoes did not reach. My wife, as was
her wont, played cribbage on the deck with
the mate, sitting severely upright and gazing
occasionally across at her partner with an
abstracted expression on her face. I leant
against the side talking with the skipper.
“The night was warm, sensuous and still.
Great tradewind clouds heaved up stately
and single out of the dark land and marched
across the heavens. The moon shone straight
down the middle of the river, and on either
side the city lay black and mysterious on
the water. With a silky rustle a big prahu
slipped by, its great triangular sail swing-
ing across the moon’s path and changing to
gossamer in the strong light. Bound sea-
wards, its narrow-gutted hold, full of dark
lumber, shadowy figures lying forward, aft a
dim form leaning over the tiller and keening
a chantey. The silky rustle and the croon-
ing song faded away along the streaming
white path of the moon, the fairy-thin sail
drifted out of the light and was lost to sight,
and far away a block creaked suddenly.
“Big, shapeless masses, substance and
shadow indistinguishably mingled, lay here
and there upon the river. We heard in the
silence footsteps walk across a floor. A
passionate cry rang from the city. Far
away, somewhere, languid fingers were stray-
ing over the strings of a viola, and the soft
notes rose and failed across the water like a
voice, sorrowful and pleading. There was
in the atmosphere the tepid sense of spring,
the gradual spring of the tropics, that calls
birds to the mating and fills the rivers with
unexpected freshes of fish.
“Suddenly a wonderful thing happened.
My wife laughed. The tone of it made us,
the skipper and me, turn quickly and look
towards the cribbage-players. tinder the
light of a hanging lantern, which buzzed
with insects, the face of my wife and the
red, grizzled, mutilated visage of the mate
hung in close conversation. The face of the
mate, which lacked an eye and part of a
nose as the result of some ancient battle in
a tavern, was shining with a monstrous and
satiric gallantry. My wife’s was quite trans-
figured with some new and strong emotion,
that made her whole figure, bent forward in
her chair, tremble visibly. They saw our
movement and resumed their cards, but my

wife, looking round at me, remarked with an
odd intonation that she would after all fol-
low my suggestion and leave in the schooner
on the morrow.
“She left in the morning. After her de-
parture the Sultan’s dignity revived. He
came quite cheerfully to see me, offering me
a young and pretty slave girl his emissaries
had captured in the jungle. ‘Until your wife
comes back,’ he remarked, adding pleasantly,
‘lt may be a long time.’
“It was a long time. She never returned.
She ‘bolted’ with the mutilated mate.”
The Old Gentleman got up out of his
penny chair and surveyed the wide horizon.
“I didn’t stay long after that. The Sul-
(an used to come and ask after my wife,
inquiring when she would be back, and prais-
ing in serious tones her many virtues. He
still maintained his harem in its youthful
freshness by crucifying his old wives and
finding brides that, as his years increased,
grew younger. He never to the end made up
his mind to kill me.”

Nulla Vestigia Retrorsum.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OH, liave you tried to track their feet,
Who march for marching’s sake.
With steps that echo to the beat
Of hearts which else would break?
The dust of home was shaken from
Their sandals long ago;
The lights of home were taken from
The only road they know—-
But dust of home or dust of Kome or dust of
Bethlehem,
My soul salutes the soldier-souls that march
in step with them.
Oh, have you met the haunted clans
By whom all trails are tried;
Who leave the fireside’s ordered plans
To new-made ’groom and bride;-
Who, whether dusk falls drearily
Or tempest drowns the dawn,
Keep step, God knows how wearily,
But none the less keep on,
Until they prove that milestones move, that
stable hills change place,
But never that the feet of man his memories
outpace ?
And have you heard the music rise
(A tuneless tune and grim)
Of those who march till twilight dies
Unhelped by any hymn?
The veil of dusk is merging them
Into a rabble throng,
But evermore is urging them
A snatch of rebel song
That plays the thief with unbelief, and
filches from the past
The watchword of their bravest day to pit
them for their last.
Thus comrades see the head flung high
Of one about to fall,
As some remembered melody
Thrills out its trumpet-cail;
The faith still undeceived in him,
Responsive, leaps to hear
Her whisper, who believed in him,
“Keep step, my chevalier!”
A broken word, a broken sword, a inan at
naught may set,
But not the kiss that knighted him shall
any man forget.
They know, who march abreast of him,
The weariness of things,
The aching foot, the trembling limb.
“Yet, lo!” they say, “he sings” !
However near the tourney is,
How imminent the fight,
Because of her, his journey is
The venture of a knight,
If he recall at evenfall how once she breathed
a prayer,
Divining that the heart she touched would
find its echo there.
For such as he are they that bear
The burden of the day,
And such as these the thoughts they share
To lift them on their way;
And though no man delays for them,
And they delay for none,
The hope that someone prays for them
Is all that helps them on,
Till, dust of home or dust of Rome or dust
of Bethlehem,
Their erstwhile path shall be their pall—
and this their requiem.
VICTORIA.

Christmas Recipes.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
C> IYE us some plums of Roman Saturn’s
y feast,
Some fragments from the buttery of
Bel,
A touch of seasoning from the western East;
Mince in some Druid fancies here and there,
Stir with Thor’s hammer, and then drown
Old Care
In the big dish of ages. Mix all well
With wine of Cypress clear and crimson-dyed
To make a pudding meet for Christmastide.
Lend me a strand of Phryne’s golden hair,
A bunch of Cleopatra’s kisses warm,
The haunting smile that Sappho used to
wear,
Some tears of Ariadne pearly sweet,
The pink-white glow of Cressid’s careless
feet,
With Helen’s bosom and her round Greek
arm,
And mix them all with turkey and icecream
To furnish a Sufficient Christmas dream.
Then let me lie beneath a spreading tree,
Fill a full pipe and let the smoke-wreaths
rise,
With Omar’s flask beside my lazy knee,
And Keats and Hafiz whispering in my ear;
And let no lewd, day-walking ghost come
near
To goad my soul with thoughts of enter-
prise,
But let me rest upon the green earth’s side,
Drinking the spirit of our Christmastide.

Hymn 370.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Rev. John Gardiner, beneath all
I his belief in his vocation, felt a desire
for the more adventurous work of the
men who make the world.
He came down the long sicklied street of
Cooktown, with its rows of trees tempering
the heat, and the mists rolling up like
clothes upon the mountains which backed
the settlement, and far off on the outer reef
lie saw the surf puffing up like fine flour. It
seemed to him the gate of a world he could
never enter —the gate of Romance and Torres
Strait and pearlers and Binghis and lawless
life and tales of Spanish galleons balanced
with silver and wrecked on some coral finger
of the Barrier.
He remembered that the itching for some
new and real phase of life had made him
irritable that afternoon. He had snapped at
his wife when she had been affectionately
fussy with him as usual. She had excused
him by saying the heat would make anybody
ill-tempered, whereas it had not affected him
at all. It was the restlessness of a man who
had been intended not only for hard work,
but for hard work which offered new sensa-
tions and new successes. All living things
have this desire for change at one time or
other.
Gardiner walked down the street —his for-
mal black alpaca coat moving stiffly in the
THE TEMPTATION OF A MODERN ST. ANTHONY.
land breeze and a shapeless revolt in his
soul. He felt like offering himself as a mis-
sionary, and then rejected the idea. He was
too honest not to admit to himself that the
romance of new strange places and peoples
whispered to him more than the missionary
ideal, although most missionaries prefer
saving souls in the Coral Sea to saving souls
in New York or Nova Zembla.
He was at that moment hailed by Daley,
the publican. Cooktown has few conven-
tions, and the parson entered the hotel.
Daley met him smiling hugely—he was a
jolly, good-tempered man of Belial, was
Daley.
“We’ve got £l7 for your church organ
fund,” he said. “There was a chap here
yesterday on the scoot, an’ I got him to give
a fiver. He might as well do in his money
way as any other.”
“Seventeen pounds,” said the parson in
delighted surprise. “Thank you, Mr. Daley
—it’s so good of you.” _
“Not it- You pome inside, and 111 give
you a cheque.” . ....
He led the Rev. Gardiner into the dining-
room, where half a dozen men were drinking
quietly, went to the desk in the corner, wrote
the cheque, and gave it to the minister.
“And now,” said Mr. Daley, “have a
drink.”
“Indeed, no. You’ll pardon me. I never
touch it.”
“Have something soft. Y’ must wet the
cheque or else the organ will get sulky, and
won’t sing when you tell it to. Drink up,
boys; I’m shouting.”
“Then if I must,” said the Rev. Gardiner,
“a little limejuice and soda.”
“That’s right. Whisky for all the rest.
I’ll introduce you. The Rev. Mr. Gardiner.
These are all sailor men and pearlers, Mr.
Gardiner.”
“Oh, indeed! I’m very glad.” said the
parson, his romantic ideas returning to him.
“That’s Mr. Sigel.” Then in an aside
(“Norwegian he is—wrecked on a timber
ship down south!”) ; Mr. Banks (that’s the
cove with the red face and the tall hat—he’s
far gone, but all right) ; that’s Billy Donee
the pilot—that’s Denny O’Rourke, the
pearler, an’ them other two’s pearlers as well,
Jack Wagstaff and George Crayth.”
Everybody said, “How d’ye do” together,
and the Rev. Gardiner said: “But I inter-
rupted you, gentlemen.”
The lialf-drunken Banks replied stertor-
ously :
“Nothin’; I was talkin’ shop. Tellin’ ’em
’bout a ship I was chief of. She was one-
horse-power at that, y’know.”
“I’m sorry to say, I do not know,” said
the puzzled clergyman.
“General horse-power is four times as
much in the advertisement as it is in the
stokehole. But when I got her I made her
push 10,000 tons one mile through the water
in four minutes for 5601 b. of coal. I did that
—gimme a whisky.”
Wagstaff had been talking aside to a little
old man in a Cape Horn suit, and now his
conversation became for everybody.
“I know him,” he said. “Lockie had 10
tramp steamers, and he screwed £lOOO each
out of 15 captains as a deposit before he’d
give them berths. Then he was about to do
an able-bodied bit of insolvency, but the
man took hold and bumped £15,000 of hard
round money out of the skunk, and he went
bung on nothing.”
“Do you mean to say,” said the incredu-
lous clergyman, “that men were so penalised
in order to get such onerous positions as
captains of liners?”
“Liners —nothing!” replied Wagstaff.
“Tramps—tramps, old weevily tramps, and
then he tried to jew ’em.”
“Really!”
“Really ! I was one of ’em !”
“I’m glad to hear you got your £lOOO
back.”
“Nothing that either. I got it back, and
lost it all in a gold mine that had no gold
in it.”
“And then to earn it in so hard a way !
Dear! dear! But I suppose the romance
keeps men at sea.”
Every other man in the room snorted
indignantly, and the Norwegian began to
talk.
“Yah! I vill tell you der romanzes. Nor-
wegians buy der rotten ships of all der
worldt. You hear of miserable wreck —it
iss Norwegian. I haf ship on a bargue at
Cardiff bound by chains fore an’ aft, so she
shall not fall to pieces while we load der
coal. In the Nord Sea she go down —we
are in der boats, an’ we watch der bargue
sink slow—so slow, like we was in der theatre
watching a painted shin go down. Then we
are alone on der Nord Sea, 14 men in one
boat, one salt ham an’ one bugget water
for three days before we are pick-ed up.”
“Dear, dear!”
“I tell you some more. We are wreck-ed
on a goral rief, and we walk at low water
to a higher rock. The ship go down, slide
off der rock, und at high water springs
we are in sea up to our waists, under
sharks take us one by one till only five is
leff-et. I nefer see men on der oudside so
much want to be in der middle.”
The fair, blue-eyed, kindly, boyish Dane
(who slept naked but for a sulu. and
was wearied only for an hour after his
watch) put his great arm—tattooed with a
blue dragon and two blue and red geishas —
on the small, nervous wrist of the clergyman
to emphasise his point.
“An’ now I garry alwayze syanide of potass
so that if I again am wreck-ed I shall not
zuffer too much.”
The clergyman looked at him horror-
stricken. and Crayth said :
“Then it would be your luck to be picked
up as soon as you’d swallowed a capsule.”
The engineer began to talk, but dreamily
and as if partly unconscious.
“Shipped on the Marok from Fremantle to
Tilbury. She’d been carrying live cattle
from the Nor’-West for years, and the
ammonia ate up her plates. Engines right—
hull rotten. I could put a hammer through
a plate most anywheres, but I did a pier-
head jump, and didn’t find her out till I got
to sea. At Colombo owner comes aboard,
and I tell him I’ll go with him on the P. & O-
to London as a passenger. He nearly died of
fits, but I offered him an alternative: —
“ ‘You’ll come in your own ship, or I’ll
blow the lot to the underwriters.’
“So he spent a thousand patching her in
Colombo. He tried to escape at Port Said —
sent himself a cable, but I said : ‘Going by
the Orient, are you! Take the next cabin to
yours for me, and we’ll go to Naples like
dear, dear sisters.’
“Then he cursed my family back to Judas
Iscariot, but he spent another £BOO on her.
and we crawled to Cadiz. Said he’d leave
her there. ‘Righto,’ I said. ‘l’ve never been
overland, an’ we can have a good time at
Parry in the Mouleen Rooje.’
“So he comes again, and we bumped her
up to Tilbury. More patches and more in-
surance and a new crew, and off to see the
water again. They left her bones off Ferrol,
and a good sale it was.”
“Good heavens!” said the Rev. Mr. Gar
diner. “What cold-blooded villainy. And
were many lives lost?”
“Four or five,” said Banks carelessly. “All
in the game.”
“But”
“That’s nothin’. I’ve taken a trial trip
with a cranky steel steamer that couldn’t
keep even —had to go cock-eyed to port or
starboard with one of her hawse-holes lookin’
down vertical at the water so’s she could
see the softest way to the bottom. I had
my shoes off ready for a jump. Crossin’ the
Indian Ocean we had twice to drive the fire-
men down to duty with shovels.”
“Indeed, and why?”
“They had some ridiculous idea about
wanting to be drowned on deck instead of
in the stokehole.”
“And did she sink?”
“Not yet; but she will. Y’ see, she’s
cranky—she’s got no brains or balance.”
“Dear, dear, this is terrible. Is there no
law”
“Not outside the three-mile limit,” said
Denny O’Rourke, “and drowned sailor-men
don’t squeal.”
The newest arrival, a thin, sandy-haired
man with a ginger little goatee beard which
he caressed incessantly, began to talk
“I was on the Gunga. She was so dirty
that if you was thrown into her feet fore-
most you couldn’t fall down. First day out
we all washed in a bucket. Then the stooard
washed himself, and then he washed the
crockery. There was a French tramp down
at Suva at the time, and we Gunga chaps
went aboard to see high life in Paris, and
they was washing in a puddin’-basin. So
we was satisfied, because we was doin’ better
nor them. The deckhands and the stooard
had fights first thing. About nine o’clock
the deckhands started scrappin’, an’
about seven bells the captain and the
engineers began because o’ not enough steam
mostly.”
“Dear me, dear me!”
“Half the fo’c’s’le was for white an’ half
for black —an’ the sheep we corned for
mutton useter lie in the bunks and eat wool
out of each other. We had pigs and ducks,
and they come in, too; an’ we was pickin’ up
copra among the islands so long that every-
body went dippy lookin’ at the palm trees,
an’ all the blokes that could read and write
they got so dippy they all became poets.”
“What’s ‘dippy’?”
“Mad. Off their onions.”
“Dear me. dear me!”
“In the Red Star,” said Banks dreamily.
“She was a tramp of 1000 tons. We lost
every blade off the propeller, an’ drifted 000
miles before we put the blades on again. We
had to forge the blades out of flat sheets from
the stokehold, and then fill he l ' ,
for’ard. an’ get her dirty old tail hig ,
to tit the blades. And back we come three
knots an hour, an’ burning a few stick
Joss so that the blades u’d hold.
Mr. Gardiner was so interested that
forgot to point out the futility of burning
sticks to Joss. . o-rPflt

TWO'S COMPANY.
“Nothing,” said Wagstaff. “The Fiado and
the Alert and the Taramung all did a dive,
and they called it the act of God. f>
“Und it was der deviltry of man, said
the big Norwegian. „ OTllr _
“And plenty more,” supplemented Banks.
“Leakin’ like baskets. One craft I knew had
been walkin’ up and down sate tor years
because she had 200 tons of pig-iron in lei
bilge. She was of herself unstable, but the
pig held her up. The new owner (gimme a
whisky) couldn’t stand 200 ton of good iron
mailin’ round trips an’ payin nothing for
freight. So he pulls the pig out of her and
sells it. And then down in the lasman Sea
she did her duck, and drowned all ands.
“Dear, dear ! Terrible ! Shocking !
“There’s the soul of a ship, said 'A ag-
staff. “You build two ships to the same
plans, to the one thirty-second of an inch ot
measurement and the last half-pound of steel.
The same in line, design and displacement,
and one ship shall be stable and the other
one cranky.” _ ~ . ,
“Dear me; it’s like men and their souls.
“Joost like men,” said Sigel, the Norwe-
gian. “Joost like men, all different. Goodt,
badt, half-badt, half-goodt.” .
“Once cranky, always cranky. You cant
help an idiot unless you give him a new
brain and you can’t change his brain with-
out killing him ; and you can’t give stability
to a cranky ship without making it all over
again. I’ve known one to be cock-eyed at
anchor, and at the wharf she’d look like a
city loafer trying to lean against a post. _ At
sea she floated three-corner-wise; and in a
blow she was the worst thing under steam,
hitting the water amidships as if she were a
runaway traction engine, and the seas were
ten-ton boulders. From one list to another
—port to starboard, starboard to port, never
on an even keel. . „ ~
“But, goodness, gracious me,. said the
clergyman. “Surely the authorities
Wagstaff laughed scornfully:—
“The authorities see with owner s eyes.
British classification with them is as good
as A 1 at Lloyd’s.”
“I remember a long tow, said the man
with the ginger goatee. “She was a German

She had no steering way, so old Getsoon-

wurst refused to be towed to Cooktown, and
chose Hall Sound. Well, when our one-goat-
power steamer got him into the Narrows
and broken water towing a ship five times
our own size, old Gotinhimmel shrieked to
be taken out again—yelled to us to tow him
to Cooktown or Hell.”
“Dear me, dear me!”
“We couldn’t turn in the Narrows, and
our old man pretended he couldn’t hear, and
went on. It took ’em nearly a day to break
their anchor and get it apeak. The Ger-
man put out 600 fathoms o’ chain, and it
walked home only a link to the minute. We
got £l5OO for salving her and £2OOO for a
tow right to Singapore or Sydney, and
Kaiser Villem he selected Singapore, because
there was a fair wind south-east.”
“Rather bewildering, but extremely inter-
esting,” murmured the reverend gentleman.”
“We towed her to Singapore, and then
the old man ups and buys her and tows her
back to Sydney in the teeth of the sou’-
easter. We did it at three knots an hour,
and days dead slow in heavy seas for fear
of snapping the towline.”
“What did you have out?’ inquired Wag-
staff lazily. £
“Two hundred and forty fathoms of four-
an’-a-quarter-incli wire hawser, and the Ger-
man’s 30 fathom of chain.”
“Big sag?” .
“F'ourteen hundred and forty feet of it
sometimes, or close up. She was a big. ugly
cow of 3000 tons capacity—too short an’
deep an’ broad for the length. She’d 800
ton o’ ballast aboard, and she shipped seas
all over, and if we were lifting on a sea and
the German was coming down another she
looked as if she wanted to come aboard us
and be sociable.” , ,
“Well,” said the slow man, who had not
yet spoken. “I was mate of the Barraby
Belle, and the old bitch of a brigantine got
piled up on Brampton Shell. Oh. don’t look
at me out of your booziest eye, Bourke, me

but we all had a big drink and a feed first,

by the story, but the parson said
“Dear me, how uncomfortable—lioW Vei-y
Uncomfortable, indeed !

was skipper of a schooner belonging to Cook-
town. She was blackbirding at Santa Cruz

rudder, and by the same token all her niggers
one way and another in the long run. She
got dismasted, and drifted to the nor’ward
of New Guinea. 'There she had to wait six

“Dear me, dear me! HoW unfortunate!

“Me,” said Druce the pilot, “little me in
trouble. Seventeen hundred miles in an
open boat—Starbuck Island to Wallis
island. Nine men, six tins of bully beef, five
men died. We chewed hat linings, and we
ate a pith hat. For a bit we felt like eating
ourselves.”
“And every day worse than the one
before,” said the minister. “Terrible!”
“No, it isn’t cumulative. After five days
all desire died. You feel light after that—
light in the body and the legs. Starvation
is just like a pipe dream, only you never

“Once,” said the man with the ginger
goatee, “I was up in the Bay of a Thousand

usually silent man. “Wherever you land

the publican.
“Dear me, no; really nothing. I hope
you’ll excuse me! And I must go. It has

the afternoon. Well, gentlemen, good-bye,

He stopped and looked at them and knew
his place in life was fixed, as he added softly,
“And, gentlemen, I thank you for the lesson.”
At home that evening when the stars came
over the mountain and pricked the velvet,
soft air the Reverend Gardiner begged his
wife’s pardon for his terrible sin of irrita-
bility that morning. And later on in the
little sea-beaten, wind-beaten church that
looked upon the reef he announced the hymn
after the sermon with a new understanding
of the words :
“ ‘These men see the works of the Lord and
His wonders in the deep.’ Hymn three hun-
dred and seventy:—
Eternal Father, strong to save,
Whose arm hath bound the restless wave,
Who biddst the mighty Ocean deep
Its own appointed limits keep,
Oh, hear us when we cry to Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
And the new organ, whose fund had been
increased by the bounty of the sailor-men,
did the rest.

Argument.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the hock-deep dust of the hnely-mihed
street, Silverton roared of the silver
and the whisky and the wildly adven-
turous manhood of its first boom. Men
talked a great deal of Charlie Cameron King-
claitns, of the “Six over Six” and the
Six over Eight,” and a very little of the
big iron range in Mount Gipps horse pad-
dock, known as Broken Hill and considered
as next to nothing.
The Reverend Walter Timms —good, Well-
meaning man—sighed disappointedly at the
wildness of it as if lie expected such fierce
births as mining camps to be subdued as the
THE ONE: “Since I have taken that treatment I have been a different woman.'"
THTE OTHER: “I am so glad. And how pleased all your people must he."
death bed of a duchess, where the doctor’s
manner is soft as silk velvet and the nurses
walk with feet of moss.
And then he sighed again, but with relief,
as three men found him at the door of the
sweltering, crackling, sunbuckled, iron-roofed
crazy shealing which was mostly a brokers’
office, but by the grace of tolerance was on
Wednesday night and on Sundays the
Methodist chapel.
There was a very big man, Bill Crawford,
the coach driver; a small, excitable, ener-
getic man, Domenico Cappazuti, leaning like
most of his countrymen to Darwin and
rationalism; and Ernest Brocken, a young
fellow of twenty-three, a broker’s clerk. Mr.
Timms talked to them of, the weather and
the dust, though the beautifully soft night
of the Barrier Ranges should
have made him forget the
little inconveniences of the.day.
But when other young men
arrived the Reverend Timms
abandoned the dust and the
sun as conversational matter.
He led the way to the rear of-
fice where the big table w r as
prepared for the Debating So-
ciety and the nickel lamp
burned brightly through its
, siege of whirling moths.
The Reverend Timms had
initiated the debating society
partly because he wanted to
save a few young men from
the perils of the camp, but
more because he had the very
human failing of loving the
sound of his own voice. Craw-
ford had joined it, partly from
a kindness of heart that prevented his re-
fusal of any reasonable request, partly be-
cause he could talk well, and knew it. Cap-
pazuti had been born arguing, and his fifty
years of life had developed a closeness of
reasoning which made him a tough opponent
in debate, even though his wondrously idio-
matic English handicapped his expression.
And the others —the very young men—had
come because they were very young tee-
totallers. and therefore had nothing but work
to interest them on the field.
The Reverend Walter Timms seated him-
self at the head of the table nearest the
lamp so that the green midges and the
straw-colored moths flew about him, and he
used both hands unceasingly to drive them
away. The reverend gentleman drew the
attention of the members of the society to
the new blotting-pad, the paper and the ink
before each man, whereat most of them looked
aghast, as if they feared they were expected
to write a novel at a sitting. He also drew
attention to the other properties—the water
bottle, and the water bag near at hand for
its replenishment, and the six glasses. Such
a quantity of water was not quite necessary,
but. said Mr. Timms beamingly, it made the
table look almost Parliamentary.
The Reverend Timms arose with a large
sheaf of closely written paper in his right
hand. His left was upon the table sup-
ported by his fingers placed in the form of
a digitated arch —a position imposing but
uncomfortable. He struck at a large moth
with the sheaf of papers and made the lamp
rock perilously. Then he ignored the moth
and spake.
“Friends ! We afff here to-night to —er—
inaugurate the Barrier —er—Ranges Debat-
ing Society. Ha! Hum! i When I--er—
approached our good, kind friends, Messrs.
Crawford and Cappazuti, on the a—ah —
hum—necessities of a —er —debating society
he-e-ah, ofle and all aek-Amoiu-ledged that if
we—ah —tin}—“Wished—were desirous, and
that is to say, Were seized —yes, seized —of
the —ah —hum—indispensable necessity of
protecting our young men from the ah —hum
—insidious and —er —seductive —-wickedness
of alcohol, of gaming and of—er —ah—hum
• —other Evils, it would be necessary to find
“er some —employment—or pursuit—recrea-
tion, I may say —to take their place.
Although our own sense of all that is good
and right-e-ns—er—prevents—er, hum —
precludes US taking the—er —ah —hum —
place of such evils in any—ah—form. And
so it was decided —er —decided by ME —and
endorsed by our good, kind friends, Messrs.
Crawford and Cappazuti, that—er —hum—
the debating society be —hum —brought into
—er —being.”
The moth whirled around his head again
and he struck at it with the rolled-up sheaf
of his speech and hurt his ear with his own
eloquence. With a smile signifying the for-
giveness of the martyr waiting for the lions
in the Colosseum he proceeded:—
“It. was then—hum—decided by—er—ME
• —and endorsed by Messrs. Cravyford and
Cappazuti that I should takd the affirmative
in most questions and be —er —supported by
Signor Cappazuti, and that Mr. Crawford
should lead the hum —negatives. It was
furthermore decided that all you young men
should support the negative side, as we felt
that it would be unfair to—to be —ahum—
opposed in equal numbers by old debaters
like MYSELF and—hum—Signor Cappazuti.
We are two and you are many, but we are
not afraid —no —not afraid. Oh ! bless the
moth !”
He smote at the moth, which merely flut-
tered to the safe side of the lamp globe,
looked at the seducing light with eyes of
opal, and opened and folded its mealy wings.
“As I was saying—we are opposed to all
of you, but not for long. No ! Because with
such tutors and exemplars as MYSELF and
Signor—er—hum—Cappazuti you will soon
be able to debate on the most involved and
—er—hum —abstruse — abstruse —hum—sub-
jects such as we will put before you. But
we will, not be afraid —not afraid... .Oh,
bother the moth!
“The subject, then, selected for this first
debate, as —er —hum —notified to you at our
formation meeting last week—is one suited—
purposefully selected—l may say—to suit
the young, half-formed—hum—intelligences
such as I see here. But later we shall make
you so expert as to fit you—for—debating—
in mock Parliaments' —even in real Parlia-
ments. The subject then selected bears this
title. To the believer it will admit of neither
■ —hum—difficulty nor —er—ha—hum—argu-
ment. The question is: ‘ls the scheme of
Creation based on strictly utilitarian prin-
ciples?’
“I lead in the affirmative. .. .Gracious
me ! I wish the moth would either get into
the lamp or fly away !
“Is the scheme of Creation based on
strictly utilitarian —hum—principles? I say
yes, and I will prove it.”
He unrolled the heavy wad of paper and
began to read or to preach or to declaim or
to expound—anything but to argue.
“To doubt this would be to doubt the good-
ness of All Wise Providence vouchsafed to
us. and that, as believers, we must never do.
We know that the world was created in six
days ; yet despite the naturally hurried man-
ner which such a period for such a colossal
w T ork would predicate, we see how good, how
perfect everything is. Remember it was not
the world only that was thus made in the
short space of six days. Mars was included,
so was the Sun, Sirius and the Pleiades were
remembered; and the Moon was not for-
gotten. Consider ! a formless void, an abyss
aching with its own depth, yet alone, unaided
by workmen, by navvies or miners or car-
penters or agriculturists or engineers, and in
spite of the rather hurried, almost precipi-
tate, nature of the work, the plans were so
well laid that in no case was any idling found
wanting. The blade of grass, perfect as the
mountafib; the lion perfect as the little sar-
dine swimming in the sea. Then man—the
crowning work —the most perfect of achieve-
ments, was made of dust, and life was
breathed into him. Strangely enough, or
rather not strangely, but as showing how"
the Divine Law has penetrated our under-
standing, we use precisely similar means to
resuscitate the found-drowned.
“The animals were created for man’s plea-
sure and his comfort —the ox to give hint
meat, cows to provide milk (and I do think
we should not be compelled to adhere to
tinned milk on this camp, but that is by
the way), sheep for mutton and for wool to
clothe us; cotton growing for shirts, hand-
kerchiefs and other things ; flax for our linen ;
fowls to lay eggs for breakfast, rabbits, to
make felt hats”
“My ole man was ruined be rabbits on the
Lachlan,” one of the negatives bitterly in-
terrupted, but the protagonist merely looked 1
at him with a cold eye and proceeded
“Mines were laid down —silver and gold,
to make men rich.”
“I wish I could sell my Purnamootsss,,
said Brocken.
“Pardon ME! Purnamootas are not the
subject of debate. Iron for railways and
ships and fireirons; horses to draw us
swiftly,” „
“This week’s coach is two days over due,
murmured Crawford, and added hurriedly, I
beg yours.”
“I beg your pardon, Mr. Crawford. As I
was saying—everything was for our usie
all based on the perfect plan —vegetables to>
keep us in health and all the fruits of the?
earth in due season for our pleasure —from
the greatest to the least living or growing
thing—made for the use of man and all
perfect with divine perfection, even to the
humblest insect. . . .Oh ! bless the moth. 1 m
sorry if I struck your nose with my papers,
Mr. Brocken.”
“Well ! Keep it quiet next time.
“I attempted to strike that —that blessed
moth. And so, gentlemen, I think I have
abundantly proved that the scheme of Crea-
tion is based on strictly utilitarian principles,
and after I have read my argument from the
exclusively Christian point of view I shall
call on Signor Cappazuti to support the
affirmative.” # *
Punctuated by fierce blows at the divinely
perfect but quite unnecessary moth, Mr,
Timms finished his “arguments” in one long,
yawning hour, and the stocky little Milanese
rose to support him. ~ ~
Between the Latin and the Celt there is
a sympathy based on common qualities, ims
may have made the Italian give an Irish sup-
port to Mr. Timms. He rose with but an
old envelope in his hand as a carrier tor
notes and supported :- .
“Gentlemen,” said Domenico Cappazuti,
“I am ask to res-pond to toast of affirmateev,
to make supportments of the Reverendo
Gentlemen! For truth, I cannot do
Ker ! Ker ! Signor Timm ! You have your
time for talk, now I. Scuse! lam ask:
‘ls the affair of the Cre-aish base on prin-
ciple utilitaire?’ For truth I say, senza
hesitazone, ‘No!’ ” He let the word out as
if it were a revolver shot.
“We are told,” continued Cappazuti, that
the world is make in six days. If we read
of the Book of Geneesees, literalmente, we
will fine that on fourt’ day the sun an
the moon is make—so Proeveedence work in
the dark free day. Ah! Ker. Ker. Ker.
It is stupido! And the world is rnake in six
day, so the cabbarge is make in six day and
the cippola —the onion—the potate he will
take three month to grow. Ah ! Ker! Iver.
Ker !—it ees r-r-rot!
“So man is made perfezione? The cow is
for milch for his cafe—but he swindle the
poor callef firrst. The bull is perfezione—
but for meat —No! The polle lay the egg
not for man but for shicken, an’ man lie
steal. Ah! Ladro! briganti. The ship
is borrn for mutton chop, hees wool is for
clothe-ese; but briganti must rob him of
hees wool in cold weather —-in brutto tempo
an’ poor ship die of cold. Man is so per-
fetto that he is born in nudita, an’ lie must
steal skin of beast for lies clotliese. If man
is born so perfetto and he will not take wool
for his clothese, and he go into the street
nakked an’ perfetto will he getta one year
in the prison for being so perfetto. I think!
Man is great because he was so little ! Pov-
eretto! He is now welsy because he worrk !
He mus’ build house or die of consump —his
lung is so tendare —so he dig in terra for
iron to make axe to tagliare the tree up —
no —cut tree down.
“If man is so perfetto why hair of whisks
grow on hes face? Why he havea the beard?
So that he pour hallef of his minestra into
hes beard when he drink his zouppe. Why
must he dig in the miniera di ferro to get
iron for make razor for cutta the whisk?
“The ‘fruit of earth in good season’ I
think ! No ! R-r-rot! Man find bitter
almond; make the cultivazione, grow the
peach ! So! Man find crabtree so perfetto
you cannot eat —he put in giardino, an’
makea the apple. He find sourberry, he
makea cultivazione and makea the wine.
Then he get drrunk !”
Mr. Timms shuddered, then struck, and
the moth escaped by a miracle.
“He finda the weed and makea the wheat.
He displace the beard and dig iron for
razzor; the whisk grow like the goat’s beard
on the face of the man who is bald. Perr-
fect man! R-r-rot! His eyes are dark and
he look troo little piece of glass an’ stone.
I-les teese will not bite the meats an’ he
makea new teese of crockery ware. He
*dig more iron to makea the knive to cut hees
nailse! Ah! So perfetto! so perfetto!
R-r-r-rot! !
“The scheme of Creaish is not base on
principle—it is ignorante —cretino—stupido.
Why is all the meat of the callef of the man’s
leg on the back of the leg and not on the
frront? What use on the back of the leg?
When a man is keek he is not keek on the
back of the callef —he is keek on the shin.
Utilitaire principle! Damn r-r-rot! !”
“Dash the moth.” ejaculated the Reverend
Timms, and slew the perfect and unnecessary
insect at a blow.
The Barrier Ranges Debating Society
adjourned indefinitely.

The Elder Son.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE elder son with mind dismayed
Harked to the prodigal’s gay laugh,
And saw him in new clothes arrayed,
And watched him eat the fatted calf,
And heard him rattle in his purse
The money he so freely spent;
Ihe elder son within his soul
Knew what the task of earning meant.
He watched his mother’s tender joy,
His father’s smile, with feelings' grim.
And jealous anger for the care
lhey never had bestoAved on him.
He heard him tell his racy tale
With bitter thoughts within his heart;
lhey made him hate his sober days,
The home, the farmstead and the mart.

And when the prodigal had gone
-Lne elder son went on the jag.
The milkman woke the house at daAvn ;
And stolen was the unmoved mat;
And no one on the night before,

The day’s affairs went all awry,

Of coin, he very nearly burst.

And made up in a hundred ways
The dull restraint of many years.
For three davs, till his cash was gone
And all the credit he could raise,
Like some tempestuous thing released
He wandered in hilarious ways.
And then returned with muddy boots,
And dust upon him everywhere,
An unrepentant prodigal
With vine leaves twisted in his hair.
“I, your unsalaried servant long
Have been,” he cried, “but just this spree
I feel I needed. Well, ’tis done —
Now kill the fatted calf for me !”
His parent answered with a roar
That split in twain his features grim,
He seized a bucket from the floor
And hurled cold water over him.
For weeks his father raved at large,
And called him hard and nasty names.
His mother looked in sad reproach,
But only said : “Oh, Henry James!”
A mark for everybody’s scorn
He knew e’er one short week had run,
He must not be a Prodieral

THE PRODIGAL’S RETURN, C.O.D.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
have been moments,” said Pat-
rick Mackaboy, barman, “when I have
enjoyed affluence. I’ve a vivid remem-
brance of a spell of great plenty, with copi-
ous expenditure and slavish imitations of
the by-play of the Rake in Progress, that per-
sisted for weeks, nay months.”
Downward spoke: “I endured privations
ind the simple life, with a milk diet, and
VERY URGENT.

Sydney after the holidays. Coin to be

anxious. He says that he can't do without
me any longer.”

saved one hundred pounds once.” Downward
was looking sadly at the last layer of his
nip, “It’s the only thing I have seriously
regretted in a long life that I could not
conscientiously recommend as a model for
the young.”
“You invested in a Westralian wild-cat,
the property of two church elders and a
reputable Iv.C.M.G. Giving a life-like imi-
tation of a guinea-pig.” Mackaboy wore a
wise old smile.
“No,” said Downward. “Guess again.”
“You put it in cold storage with a financial
institution of the fruitage of ’92, an institu-
tion conducted by 20 of our best and purest,
to encourage thrift in the working and lower
middle classes, and the roof fell in.”
“No,” said Downward. “I wore it in my
breast pocket, next my heart, when saving
the fairest girl in the world from the attack
of a monster in human form. I held her up
in a fainting condition, and encouraged her
with words of wise and kindly counsel, and
when she was strong again I put her in a
cab, and gave auntie’s address to the driver.
I found 124 minutes later that the sweetest
creature on earth had accepted my hundred
as a temporary loan.”
“Inquiries at Auntie’s were without avail?”
said the barman.
“You’ll take my unsupported word for
that.”
Patrick Mackaboy dusted flies off the
cream cheese. “Those,” he said, “are the
tales a wise man never tells in the first per-
son singular. My experience is quaint and
original, but I profited enormously while
being egregiously deceived, without appearing
as a deserving object of public derision by
being taken down in the conscientious per-
formance of good works. Charity covers a
multitude of sins, Dickie, but nothing excuses
the chump.
“Nevertheless, I was wronged, deceived,
and treacherously done by in a manner hurt-
ful to my vanity as Patrick the Perspicaci-
ous, the gay deceiver being a comparative
small boy, willing in wickedness, but as yet
untutored in the sly ways of the world, it
seemed to me.
“His name was Jonathan Winterbottom :
but 1 had only his Avord for it, having m.
cognizance of his earlier history. He came
into my bar one night on the other end of
a long, Ethiopian cheroot, and mentioned
whisky. The helping he gave himself indi-
cated large, liberal ideas and an open, gener-
ous disposition.
“Jonathan had a little iron chin and a
nicely-chiselled, granite jaw. His eyes were
steel grey, and on acquaintance one detected
a certain brassy resemblance between his
face and a lawyer’s doorplate. But Master
Winterbottom Avas a handsome boy, squarely
set up, slim, hard as bricks. If you threw
an old suit of fireman’s dungarees at him,
and they just stuck, he’d look a gentleman
in them. He seemed to be 24, he may have
been 30. You couldn’t disconcert him with
a sledgehammer. He had the assured air
of one who had been tried in all the furnaces
of the Fates, and had come out two quid to
the good.
“These impressions dawned later in the
day. My original idea was that Johnnie
was a bright boy, considering his. limited
opportunities—-.exceptionally facile with a
cue, accomplished at the piano, and possess-
ing only one profitable trick worthy of the
regard of a grown man, a neat way of sliding
the four aces out of a pack.
“Master Winterbottom had been drifting
in and out of the pub two months or so. He
wanted to succeed the old, dried billiard-
marker, with carpet shoes and cotton wad-
ding in his ears, whom we were then keeping
out of the cemetery, and I was using my
influence. But one day he came to me with
a newspaper clipping.
“ ‘Billiard-marking is far beneath me,’ he
said. ‘Peruse.’
“The clipping was from the ‘Missing
Friends’ column. It was in larger type and
betrayed more concern than usual. It of-
fered £5OO reward to any person or persons
Avho might supply such information as would
lead to the recovery of Walter
Embling, only son of James
Embling. Esq., of Willowdell,

“‘Well?’ I said.
“ ‘Continue the affecting
tale.’ he said.
“I read: ‘Said Walter
Embling left bis parents’ home
in March, 1902. He was then
19 years of age, about sft. 9in.
high, dark hair, dark eyes, of
slight build, and handsome, with
a pink mark like an acorn cup
on the left forearm.’
“ ‘And what of it, child ?’ I
added indulgently.
“ ‘lt says £5OO reward.’
“ ‘The facts are as stated.’
“ ‘How could Patrick do with
a solid £2OO of that?’
“ ‘Leave off your damnable
faces and begin!’ said I.
“ ‘To be sure. I propose
being Master Walter Embling
for a while. Long enough, at
least, to gather up that £500.’
“ ‘Nice boy ! Does it look so
easy to you?’
“ ‘lt looks a bright possibility. Walter was
19 in 1902. That lands him in his 25fh
now. I might just as well be 25 as any-
thing. Dark hair, dark eyes, slim, hand-
some —what’s wanting?’
“ ‘You’re not forgetting the pink acorn
cup, are you, Jonathan? It seems an im-
portant detail.’
“Jonathan Winterbottom looked tired.
‘Not in the slightest,’ he said. ‘l’ve adopted
a pink spot. Pricked it in yesterday.’ He
rolled up the sleeve of his left forearm, and
disclosed a pale pink blemish about the size
and complexity of an acorn cup.
“ ‘But if that’s not the exact location of
the birthmark you’re up for a legal term for
false pretences.’
“ ‘Not possible. I make no pretences.
That’s your little bit, Paddy.’
“ ‘Oh-o ! Conspiracy to defraud ! Seven
years ! Good-day, Jonathan !’
“ ‘And you claim to have brains!’ said the
boy wearily. ‘There are no pretences, there
is no conspiracy. You have discovered a
bright, slim, dark-eyed, handsome lad who
might easily have left his happy home in
Willowdell, Sussex, Eng., in the year 1902,
and whose name could be Walter Embling
as well as anything, although he is at present
masquerading under an alias. You explain
these facts to the stricken parents, especially
the long-suffering mother. You dwell upon
the Prodigal’s aristocratic demeanor, his
exalted conduct up against the slings and
arrows of outrageous fortune, and his remark-
ably engaging personality. Meanwhile you
pick up all obtainable items of family inter-
est and such domestic facts concerning the
Emblings of Willowdell as are offering and
may be of value to me. The rest may safely
be left to little Jonathan. You take £2OO
for your small service, handing me £3OO im-
mediately after settlement. I hang on as
mother’s lost boy for a little time, and then
Walter gets out on his travels again. Why,'
A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION.
"Your husband writes novels?”
“Yes.”
“Where does he get his plots?”
“Oh, he just rummages round my past.”
it’s the simplest deal on earth beneath.’
“I fixed him with my eagle eye—first to
the left. ‘And why doesn’t Johnnie work
this ingenious swindle all on his own?’
“ ‘How can Johnnie? The lost son offer-
ing himself couldn’t stipulate for the ample
reward. That would show a grasping and
unfilial nature. It would be abominably un-
romantic, and bet your life these Emblings
want some romance for their money. Be-
sides, Walter must be reluctant. It should
be plain to the meanest that Walter had
his reasons for leaving the happy home in
Willowdell, Sussex, Eng. It is not peevish
wilfulness that has detained him so long
from the affluence of the Emblings. You
are appraising Mr. and Mrs. without Wal-
ter’s knowledge. Walter, it seems, has
sworn never to return to the old home until
he has redeemed his name or cleaned up his
naughty past, or words to that effect.’
“Will you believe it? The rip persuaded
me. It all sounded so easy, he was so con-
fident, so plausible, and the 200 golden
sirens were calling, calling, with the musical-
drip of nice fresh coin. I had no particular
yearning for a lump of money when possi-
bilities arose, but as the plot thickened I
acquired an insupportable itch for twice
£lOO down.
“Boys, I am not constitutionally formed
to resist temptation. When I was fashioned
the stop for that particular wile was left
out. I yielded. On the morning of Decem-
ber 7, 1908, I sat in one room of the suite
of Mr. and Mrs. Embling at the Brussels,
with a tremulous mandible, and toying with
a rag cap to disguise the attack of ague
that had settled in my hands. Mr. and
Mrs. Embling would be with me presently.
“They came, and it looked easier still.
James Embling, Esq., was one of those thin,
grey, neat gentlemen of England who dis-
guise their nervous debility behind a mili-
tary manner and £5OOO a year. Mrs. Em-
bling was darker and plumper, with a sen-
timental mouth and soulful eyes. I knew
at a glance she would yield to tears when
little Walter’s name was mentioned.
“She did. I put the matter as delicately
as possible. ‘I have no positive assurance
that this is the young man,’ I said, ‘and I
am anxious not to raise false hopes.’
“Embling senior became semi-hysterical.
‘Then why did you come liyah, sir-—why did
you come hyah? Don’t you see how you
are upsetting my wife, sir? Why not my
solicitors? We have had fifty wretched
people with a lot of vagabonds, and my wife
can’t stand it. Dem it all and bless my soul,
sir, the advertisement says distinctly “apply
Messrs. Bond and Bond, solicitors, Chan-
cery Lane, City.” ’
“Mrs. Embling ceased weeping for a
moment and said ‘James !’ with proper em-
phasis. , ,
“ ‘Yes, yes, my dear; but dem it all and
bless my soul’
“ ‘James!’
“James subsided, and I was at liberty to
explain that the young man I had in mind
was a high-spirited and sensitive English
gentleman who had given me the impression
that he was busy redeeming an unhappy
past and qualifying to return to his parents’
arms in his own good time, when he felt that
at length he was worthy. He would need
careful handling, and if approached by law-
yers would probably bolt to the ends of the
ear th
“ ‘That is so like dear Walter,’ said Mrs.
Embling. ‘so like dear Walter.’
“ ‘But dem it all and bless my soul, Agnes,
we can’t’
“ ‘James!’ said Agnes severely, and James
shut up. ‘Remember,’ the lady continued,
‘we are travelling the world over seeking
our poor lost boy. How foolish it would be
to despise any possibility that presents it-
self.’
“Naturally the weeping partner had hei
way. James was not even permitted to
with his feet, his tendency to ‘dem it al
was rigorously repressed. He had to sit
still while I conversed with Walter’s mother.
The conversation lasted over an hour. The
points of my protege corresponded in a start-
ling manner with those of the missing heir.
I could satisfy Mrs. E. re all important de-
tails barring the pale pink birth stain. D 1
that I said I knew nothing, the conspirators
having decided to reserve it for a convinc-
ing climax. In return the artless mamma
directly and indirectly commu-
nicated quite a quantity or
valuable information concerning
the Emblings of Willowdell,
Sussex, and the pretty ways ot
little Walter when a boy, his
lovely brown curls, his affection
for Aunt Martha, etc., etc.
“This useful knowledge I
communicated to Jonathan
Winterbottom, and the boy
seemed pleased. ‘With these
items and the shamed reticence
proper in a conscience-stricken
prodigal, I shall pull through,’
said lie.
“The meeting came off as art-
fully arranged. Mr. and Mrs.
Embling walked into my room
unannounced at half-past four
on the following day, and Pat-
rick and the boy were there.
That was P. Mackaboy’s cue to
get out, closing the door softly,
and turning the key in the lock
to prevent flight on the part of
the wayward son. But I saw
enough before leaving to con-
vince me that all was going
well with the conspiracy.
Mrs. Embling stood staring at Jonathan
Winterbottom. Her face was ashen. James
stared too, stuttering in all his limbs, chat-
tering ‘Dem it all and bless my soul!’ like a
muddled cockatoo. But Jonathan’s look of
amazement and incredulity tinctured with
filial love was a masterpiece of art.
“ ‘Mother !’ he said.
“Then I shut the door. When Pat
Mackaboy reappeared the money was won.
Jonathan Winterbottom, his coat off, and
the pale pink stain in the semblance of an
acorn cup fully exposed, was in Mrs. Bm-
bling’s arms, and Embling. Esq., sat clinging
to the boy’s hand, snivelling foolishly, and
‘demming’ his own soul world without end.
“Jonathan was sustaining the character
marvellously well. There was no more need
for me. What happened in the intervening
days I know not, but on December 11 I held
the cheque of James Embling for 1500, and
Mrs. Embling bestowed this ring and a
blessing one yard long.
“The cheque was cashed at half-past two.
At 3.40 Jonathan Winterbottom held £3OO
of the loot. He wanted to take £350 be-
cause of the comparative unimportance of
my speaking part, but your good friend clung
to his portion. Furthermore, he offered
stern admonition.
“ ‘Here is where the need of great caution
arises, Johnnie boy.’
“ ‘Walter !’ he said.
“ ‘Well, Wallie. We are not through.
This is a criminal vagary of ours, and the
next development may be anything up to
ten years. You are called upon to get out
with what expedition you may. The pro-
digal must abscond once more before the
inevitable suspicions arise.’
“ ‘lf there’s a man living whose sagacity I
respect, it is Patrick Mackaboy, barman,’
said Winterbottom.
“ ‘Then don’t delay the next move. Don’t
dally. Don’t try to work James Embling
for anything further, but walk along. Mean-
while I shall retire from public life, and
seek change of air and scene at Geelong or
some similar centre of life and gaiety.’
“ ‘You may rely on me to keep Pentridge
well in the background,’ said Jonathan, and
I felt I could.
“I retired forthwith, and lived on my
means, drifting pleasantly from Hobart to
elsewhere, and hearing nothing more of the
Emblings. Concluding all was well I took
office at the Lotus, in Sydney, and crash it
came. A little society item in a weekly to
the effect that among the guests at a guber-
natorial dinner were Mr. and Mrs. James
Embling, of Willowdell, Sussex, Eng.; also
Mr. Walter Embling, son of the aforesaid.
“Whoo! Jonathan was a-going it. I felt
feverish. It did not end there. In a few
days the engagement of Mr. Walter Em-
bling, son of etc., etc.* to Miss Betty Dell-
bourge, only daughter of one of the swagger-
est old families on the land in N. S. Wales,
was officially announced. I never felt the
Sydney climate so oppressive. I was never
so curious about the demand for ambidex-
trous barmen in Alaska.
“My subsequent meeting with Jonathan
Winterbottom was not wholly fortuitous.
He was wearing out the most radiant motor-
car in the State.
“ ‘How is this?’ I demanded, with some
show of ferocity. ‘Run your own dilly head
against gaol walls if you like, but we are
not all blessed with a brain-pan like a f-inch
iron crucible.’
“ ‘Where do you feel it, Paddy?’ he asked.
“ ‘ln the neck,’ I said. ‘You’re a bam-
boozler. You’ve tricked and deceived me.’
“ ‘There was no other way,’ said Jonathan
with bland insouciance. ‘I simply had to
have that £3OO, and my earlier knowledge
of James Embling satisfied me that he would
be tardy in giving gifts to the prodigal, more
especially in a £3OO lump.
“‘Your earlier knowledge?’
“ ‘Just so.’ Jonathan was winning up his
sleeve. ‘lt might have occurred to you that
that was a genuine pink spot,’ he said. ‘Ob-
serve it narrowly. It is the original im-
print.’
“‘How does that help?’
“ ‘Must I take out a sworn declaration?
The fact is, Patrick, there was no deception,
excepting in our little friendly arrangement
to split up the £5OO. I am Walter Em-
bling The barman sighed deeply.
“There’s no doubt about it, boys, my con-
fidence had been shamefully abused. He was
the goods.”

“Kodak”: The keenest tisherman I ever
met was a man who had spent more than
half his life in a dry Far West mining town
that had never heard the croak of a frog.
Similarly, the most devoted vegetable-
grower I ever knew was a retired sea cap-
tain who never had a capful of earth to
shuffle during his days of active service.
At present I am secretly enjoying the vigor
and resourcefulness of a Poverty Point con-
troversialist who is pen-dghting musicians,
actors and other persons of long
experience about operas, plays and play-
makers, and gallantly holding his own.
The joy of the situation lies in the
fact that he has only just emerged from a
town where the wandering actor snatches
an occasional crust with great difficulty.
But, whilst buried in that agricultural fast-
ness, my friend evidently kept a keen, not
to. say blazing, eye on London, Paris,
Vienna, Petrograd and other centres. If he
had emerged armed to the teeth with facts
and gossip about wheat and devastated the
Aboriginalities column, I would have under-
stood ; but his whirling and brilliant arrival
in the grease-paint and high-kick column is
a shock of the first order.

hunched, took deep draughts of water every now and

“The Oldest Inhabitant”; The most
house on the Blue Mountains
(N.S.YV.) is a stone cottage on the Batliurst-
road at Lawson. It is now a sort of a farm
house, but in the years that are gone it was
the Blue Mountain Inn, kept by the Wilson
family. When the railway was continued
through, the Wilsons built another pub
nearer the station, and that has in its turn
been replaced by something w r ith more brass
and mirror about it. The Blue Mountain
Inn was really born at Emu Ford, on the
Nepean, where, about IS3O, Jacob Joseph-
son. father of the late Judge Josephson,
built the Governor Bourke, which was kept
by Wilson, his son-in-law. As traffic ex-
tended the Wilsons pushed westward and
settled at what is now Lawson, but tvas

“F.C.”: The ideal place to buy an um-
brella—not to xiiention a motor-car or a

Railways Lost and Unclaimed Property
Store on selling-off day. I attended the
last Melbourne function, and the bargains
offered in umbrellas and other things were
stupendous. The auctioneer rushed through
like a joy-riding motorist. The umbrellas
were put up in lots of a dozen each, men’s
and -women’s mixed, and realised from ss. to
10s. per dozen. My lot cost me 75., and
comprised three gent.’s (one good, one
medium, one hopeless), eight women’s (one
practically new, five good, two useless), and
one parasol—not too bad. I learnt that
the gibe about man’s forgetfulness of his
brolly is a libel, as my proportion of nine
women’s to three men’s is the average—and
men use the railways more than women.
Judging by the articles for sale, the com-
munity is prepared to lose pretty well every-
thing ever invented, barring aeroplanes and
soap. Nobody ever seems to lose soap.
Swags, handbags, portmanteaux, dress-
baskets, are interspersed with women’s
undergear, violins, cameras, women’s hats,
packets of tea, watches (gold, silver and
metal), bracelets, chains, brooches, galvan-
ised iron, rabbit poison, bikes, carpets (some
new). All these had been mislaid, and
were knocked down at dirt-cheap figures.
It is hard to account for any person losing
or failing to call for a reaper-and-binder,
which, being in very bad condition, brought
but £6, or a set of harrows, an acetylene gas
plant, or a harvester, in decent condition,

which realised £9 10s. The articles the De-
partment likes most to see forgotten are
naturally those the public seldom loses the
run of—things that declare their true value
on their faces, and so bring their full whole-
sale price—13 doz. Australian stout, three
lots of J.D.K.Z., two dozens of well-known
brands of whisky, tea, wine and the galva-
nised iron. But ever there is the haunting
mystery—how do people forget such things
as harvesters, reapers-and-binders, the liquor
supply of a picnic party, -and such like ?
dance of the immortals—on the treasury
DOORMAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Said the new, young Loan to the old, old Loan,
As they met on the Treasury mat:
“Will you tell me, I pray, though your whiskers are grey,
How you keep so remarkably fat ?
It must surely be years
Since they hailed you with cheers,
And kind words, and some cases of fizz?
Now, you ought to lie low—
Tell me, Is it not 50?”... .
And that ancient Loan answered: “It is I”
JUST AS HE LIKED.
“I look upon you, sir, as a rascal
“You are privileged to look upon me in any
character you desire to assume, sir. ”
Said the new, young Loan: “But a few weeks are flown
Since Government brought me to birth ;
But I quite recognise, from the look in your eyes,
That you’ve been a long time upon Earth !
Yet, I see by the books
And that statue of Cook’s,
Which they set up with you, long ago,
That you should have reached Heaven
About Eighty-Seven! ”
And the ancient Loan answered: “That’s so !”
Said the new, young Loan in a confident tone:
“This is most reassuring to me!
Though they labelled me short when I left Capel Court,
There’s a prospect most pleasing to see.
If you’ve lived all this time—
And you’re long past your prime—
Then we Loans can’t be easy to kill.
1)0 you think I shall thrive,
And for years be alive?”
And that hoary Loan answered: “You will t”
Said the new, young Loan: “I’m not very well grown,
And there’s lots that I don’t understand.
"Would you mind saying why —though expecting to die —
Your days have been long in the land?
I’m a little bit mixed,
For I thought that—once fixed—
Our date of expiry would do us?”
Said the old Loan: “Oh, no!
Once it used to be so,
But now they’re compelled to renew us!”
Said the old, old Loan: “I remember the stone
And the bronze (that I paid) for that statue,
Some sixty years back, when employment was slack—
Much slacker than when they begat you!
. But, to tell you the truth,
In the days of my youth,
Whenever they went to beget us,
We were no sooner hatched
Than they promptly attached
A Sinking Fund creature that ate us!”
Said the new, young Loan, with a shuddering moan:
“How horrible! Then you were sent for?”
And the Ancient replied: “Yes ; we certainly died
At the end of the time we were lent for!
But, somehow or other,
Both I and a brother
, Were placed in our cradles without one.
And, since then, some dozens
Of nephews and cousins—
Why, nobody troubles about one!”
OVER THE ODDS.
“A bonza pup, by cripes 'e was! I’d ’ave
given any bloomin' thing to 'ave 'im!"
“ Wouldn't th ’ bloke sell 'im?"
“Yairs!!! But 'e wanted five bob!”
Said the old, old Loan: “I’m as fat as a drone!”
And he made the remark with a chortle:
“You have no cause to grieve;
Why, I really believe
That Loans, nowadays, are immortal!
Just look at my length,
And my weight—and my strength!
And I’ve no Sinking Fund as a tether!..
Whoop ! Take hands with me !”....
And they danced there with glee
On the Treasury Doormat together !

AT POVERTY POINT.
“Rat-a-Tat’ : The stage lady who suspects
that she has been trapped by the villain,
rushes at each locked door in turn, and
strikes the panels three times with her
clenched lists. Even the most frenzied real-
life prisoner would go for the handle first;
but the she-actor flies straight at the obstacle
and batters the wood high up with her frail,
pale hands. Both in “Mr. Wu" and “The
Yellow Ticket” the conventional female door-
batterer worked the old, w r orn-out stunt.
Who originated it? I first noticed it vears
ago in that fine old thriller, “La Tosca.”
“Masetto”: St. George’s Hall (Melb.)
housed some interesting and unusual shows
ir. its heyday. C. B. Fisher got rid of his
large stable of racehorses by an art union
there. YV oodroofe, the glass-blower, ran his
good entertainment, and the Fakir of Volu
had his suspended lady and his prismatic
fountain on the premises. The Lynch fam-
ily rang their bells there many a time, and
Chang, the giant, displayed his huge bulk.
It was at St. George’s, too, that Mont-
gomery had his “readings,” the prices being,
on one occasion, as much as ss. to the floor,
and 2s. 6d. to the old gallery. The Duke of
Edinburgh -was present that night. Anna
Bishop warbled in the hall, and so did the
three Carandinis. Unlucky Martin Sirnon-
sen put on “The Hermit Bell” and other
light operas, and shows came and went up
to the time the hall was used as the bulk-
store postscript to a draper’s shop.
"Bill Bowyang” : Every travelling showman
has his own box of tricks. As good a one as
I know was practised by a co. featuring
"East Lynne” and “Silver King,” which
toured the top of Bananaland. It was the
habit of this crowd, when they reached a
town, to announce that one of their female
members had thrown them over, and they
would be glad of the assistance of a local
amateur. As every decent-sized township
has a stage-struck female, the company soon
had its wish supplied. Much boom in the
local sheet’s advertisement columns for the
local lady induced the local resident and his
wife to come along in large numbers. Gener-
ally the young party had a walk-on, walk-off-
mighty-sudden part. Still it pleased the town-
ship and paid the co. Nothing else mattered.
“Norbell”: Talking of early productions
of “Pinafore,” does anyone remember one
notable performance of that' opera, ’way
back in the dim and early ’SO’s? This
occurred on the deck of H.M.S. Barracouta,
ir. Sydney Cove. It was an ideal setting, of
course, but a very remarkable one for such
a pungent naval satire. Sir Joseph Porter
dressed for the part in the genuine admiral’s
cabin, and made his entrance over the ship’s
side, with all the pomp and circumstances
technically correct. There was a chorus
of men-o’-war’s men, and Ralph Rackstraw
was one of the ship’s crew. The Sir Joseph
Porter was the late George Evans Laber-
touche, paymaster of Imperial pensions.
He had been on the professional operatic
stage with Squires and Lucy Escott. He
was brother to P. P. of that ilk, one time
of the railways, in Victoria. One of P. P.’s
daughters married “Gussy” Loftus, son (or
nephew) of the chicken-raising Lord who
was Governor of N.S.W. I believe that per-
formance on the Barracouta was a great
success, but it evoked a sharp rebuke from
shocked and scandalised authorities in Eng-
land.
There is a young-to-middling actor in Aus-
traha whose good looks are the bane of his
life, as it were—are, indeed, an almost insup-
portable worry, so to speak. He is so be-
sieged and beset by female admirers that he
is compelled to live under cover, and the
result is a wealth of correspondence that he
could not cope with while giving his artistic
duties the attention they demand. So the
task of answering all amatory communica-
tions is handed over the player’s compara-
tively-unknown wife. The girl who has
written to Cecil, breathing affectionate re-
gard (enclosing photo.), gets a nice,
brotherly note in reply (enclosing photo.),
with words of sympathy and some advice to
the young; and no doubt she bestows the
missive among her private treasures, little
dreaming that the matter-of-fact spouse of
her adored hero is the authoress. “I am
always sweet to them,” says the matron.
Cecil can’t afford to antagonise his warmest
admirers, you know.”
“Stargazer”: The celebrated Swiss com-
edian carefully lived up to his reputation
while in Australia. People who travelled
with him have an extensive repertory of tales
of frugal effort that should be printed for
use in State schools. On one occasion the
celebrated Swiss comedian called out of a
carriage window at a wayside station for a
paper, and proffered 3d. for it. The boy
delivered the goods and started a search for
the twopence change. The whistle blew.
“Canna ye be queeker, boy?” asked the cele-
brated Swiss comedian nervously. The
train moved. “Here, here! Tak’ back yer
paper, V _ gi’ me the threepence,” squealed
the comedian. He returned the paper, and
recovered his as the carriage left
the platform. When he drew his head in
his face was pale. “Ma conscience, ’twas a
mighty near thing!” he said. Looking about
he added with awe : “An’ no means o’ stop-
ping the train in sic an imergency, either.”
VICE VERSA.
THEATRICAL MANAGER: " You understand
this contract is on the usual terms —wages
to start at the conclusion of the rehearsals.
ACTOR: “ I've had so many six weeks re-
hearsals and one week runs that, if you
wouldn't mind , Pd rather be paid for re-
hearsals and give the rest for nothing.
A PSALM OF LIFE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Life’s a counter-lunch, and we
Pause to nibble at the bar
Of the world’s great pubbery,
Where all brands of moisture are.
In the background lurks the Boss,
While his hungry clients munch,
Or for smokes and liquor toss—
Life is but a counter-lunch.
All the world is just an inn,
And its licensee is Fate;
Tempted by each darling sin,
Shall we fear the scowling slate?
Though we eat and drink our fill,
More remains to quaff and crunch ;
There is beer in Egypt still—
Life is but a counter-lunch.
In this tavern of the earth,
Try to laugh while swapping lies;
Though there be of friends a dearth,
“Have one” gaily with the flies;
Buy a pint or two of love;
There is varied fare to munch,
For, as I’ve remarked above,
Life is but a counter-lunch.
Life is just a counter-lunch,
But it’s good enough for me;
Joys it offers by the bunch,
Slices, too, of sorrow, free.
Let us, though, in cheerful mood—
Gloom’s a strict, teetotal crime!
While the cheese and beer are good,
Eat and drink till closing- time.
VICTORIA.

VICTOR J. DaALEY.
Harold Norbey’s Great Burglar
Story.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"VT OIIBEY was sacked; a misfortune
which for the moment seemed to him
infinite disaster. It did not occur
to him, except as an abstract dream of illu-
sive comfort, that to be sacked matters little
to a man 26 years old, with a nimble brain
and no confirmed vices—not even a wife.
He was sacked from his job as a morning-
paper reporter, if he only knew it, merely
because two or three big shareholders of the
Eagle had caught the disease of economy.
That was because the other newspaper was
showing a bigger net income than theirs.
Which in its turn was because—but you
don’t want a whole cycle of reasons. The
important fact is that the chief of staff had
been ordered to use the knife somewhere;
therefore he knifed Harold Norbey. Chiefly,
because he knew in his humane heart that
Norbey wouldn’t stay long out of work, and
wouldn’t have to terrify any woman with
the spectre of Want. But Norbey didn’t
guess that. He thought, for he was young in
his trade, that the Sack was evidence of his
fundamental incapacity for newspaper work.
As a matter of fact, his chief failing leaned
to virtue’s side. It was an imagination which
was capable of inspired moments.
When Norbey told Brookes, his rival on
the Chronicle, that he was sacked, he was
profoundly miserable. He and Brookes were
roundsmen. The roundsmen are they who
collect the hottest, juiciest and suddenest of
news—murders, conflagrations, garrottings
and the like. They usually hunt in company,
swapping news of small importance; but in
a Big Thing they fight like devils to beat
each other. The night that Norbey was
sacked no Big Thing was happening.
Understand that the sack was not a
cruelly immediate thing for Norbey. News-
paper offices are merciful. They give the
victim a fortnight’s notice, and he works for
that fortnight with a cold hand round his
heart, and a lump of lead in his stomach.
“What are you going to do?” Brookes
asked.
IN TOPHET.
OYSTER US : “Who is he?"
LOBSTERUS : “A strong drink adulterator meet-
ing some of the Hm-iams he created."
“Look for a job somewhere,” said Norbey.
“But to-night I’m going to get drunk.”
“Would like to help you,” the cheerful
Brookes said, “but they’ve jammed some
Mothers’ Meetings on to me to-night, and I
must pick ’em up. Go and wallow. Pick
me up at the Grecian’s at 1 a.m., and I’ll
tell you what’s doing, and carry you home.”
The Grecian’s, as everybody knows, was
the all-night steak joint, kept by a degenerate
descendant of Pericles, hailing from Patmos,
where John had his Revelation. He had a
profile which might have gone on a medal.
and a shirt which should have gone into a
tub.
So Norbey got drunk. It is not very diffi-
cult ; and. in the circumstances, it was not
very unwise. But in hours of great nervous
excitement there is a dangerous kind of
drunkenness- It does not merely make you
noisy or soppy, according to your tempera-
ment. It simply twists your brain so that
intelligence and ratiocination remain, but
prudence and reason are gone. There are
at least 73 ways of being drunk, and this is
one of the riskiest—and best.
It is not necessary to record the experi-
ences through which Norbey passed before
he found himself sitting on a kerbstone in a
quiet residential street—a street purely
suburban in appearance, though not a mile
from the centre of the city. Such streets are
natural and necessary reserves near the
brawling highways of industry; and Norbey's
erratic course, before he came to the kerb-
stone, had been of the natural and necessary
kind. He was not unhappy. His brain was
weaving fancies for the future. He saw
Harold Norbey reappearing, amid public ex-
citement. as a writer from the Depths, with
the Note of Reality in his work. He also
saw Harold Norbey, a degraded pensioner of
the worst kind, saying brilliantly bitter
things to uncomprehending associates in the
midst of vice and squalor. Each prospect
gave him a melancholy comfort. He even
began to think in metre. He was, indeed,
as drunk as he had threatened to be.
But it was hard to leave the daily excite-
ment of newspaper life. Murders! Big
robberies! To be the owner of inside know-
ledge of things that counted ! To ride, on a
footplate, down to the scene of a railway
smash ! To go up in an aeroplane—for this
sacked reporter had seen and done things!
He had shared a passenger’s seat on an aero-
plane, only a fortnight ago, with a smart
girl—dashing and plucky, swearing she would
be Australia’s first woman aviator. He knew
her address and telephone number. He
ought to have taken her to lunch. But press-
itaen don’t follow things up, unless they are
News. That girl couldn’t be asked to lunch
now. . . .
And, damn it, there wa" her house opposite
to him! These semi-suburban streets are
not all boarding-houses.
Her father was a big shareholder. Though
Norbey didn’t know, he was one of the share-
holders who had economosis of the pocket-
And, as Norbey did know, liis daughter was
one of the liveliest damsels of her city.
He hated them both. The father because
be held shares, the daughter because
she would not now be his comrade at lunch,
and she was excessively charming. He hated
his newspaper because he was sacked. His
brain worked through hatred to revenge
with logical speed, and within 15sec. he pro-
bably would have dragged a gate off its
binges—when things happened across the
road.
Extraordinary things. The sound of loud
voices and heavy feet made sudden riot in
the house opposite. Its front door was flung
open with a crash, and four figures appeared
in the light. A fat, puffing man in pyjamas,
wrestling with an athletic youth in black —
and the youth wore a black mask. A pretty
girl in evening dress—The Girl —dragging
first at one and then at the other. A maid-
servant in wild dishevelment. wringing her
hands in the background. Even while the
picture burned itself on Norbey’s reeling
brain the younger man got clear of the
older, darted out of the house, and ran like
a black wisp down the street.
Norbey still sat on the kerbstone. Then
his eyes flashed, and he looked at his watch.
It was only half-past twelve. He bounced to
his feet, and ran furiously, hitting a fence
or a wall at every fifteen paces.
“By Gosh !” he shouted to the third pillar-
box lie struck, “I’ll put up such a spoof on
them as they never had in their lives before!”
The reporter reached the Eagle office,
with his brain brilliantly alive. The automa-
tic lift swung him up into the empyrean,
where he breathed " pure and inspiring ether-
Once in the cupboard he called his room, he
rang for a messenger, with one of those in-
sistent, alcoholic rings.
“Tell sub-editor and printer,” he jerked
out, for speech was difficult though thought
raced madly, “I’ve got a real big story—
column story—fight with masked burglars at
old Johnny Lowry’s house.
Jewellery gone. Awful plucky
fight. Tell ’em it’s Mary Lowry,
the aeronaut. D’ye hear? Then
get! Scoot!”
That story was written
rapidly, but with a fierce love
for its details. Three or four
slips at a time it disappeared
in the copy-runner’s hands, and
Norbey ran into new and lurid
inventions. He made the Share-
holder —John Joseph Lowry—
so extraordinarily heroic that
when the story was blown out
he couldn’t fail to be hideously
ridiculous. The Shareholder
seized the burglar with his
hands on the spoil. They
grappled in deadly embrace.
The Girl Aeronaut came to the
rescue. There was never a
sensational detail omitted. The
lie was great, glorious and con-
vincing.
And, when proved a lie, it
would cover the Shareholder,
the Girl and the Eagle with
eternal ridicule. That twisted
brain had worked out a deadly
vengeance on them all.
Above all, and dearer than all, he knew
that the stuff was Good. Phenomenally
drunk though he was, Norbey remained an
artist. Otherwise, he couldn’t have got drunk
in just that fashion.
At the end of an hour it was a Norbey
with steady feet and glittering eyes who laid
the last three slips of copy on the sub-edi-
tor’s desk. Fortunately for the fate of his
story he didn’t breathe on the sub-editor.
He was n n innocent sub, and it might have
suffocated him-
“ This the lot?” the sub asked, and Norbey
nodded.
“Think we’ve got it to ourselves?”
“Absolute scoop,” Norbey answered, and
it seemed to him as if the words-were being
pronounced with staccato precision by some-
body five yards away from him. Then he
went downstairs —and the cabman woke him
up when they reached his gate.
“It’s a good story,” the sub said to the
printer, as they stood at the little counter
where the all-night porter could always find
a bottle. “A hell of a good story! Fancy
old Spoopendyke putting up that scrap with
a masked burglar! It would do him good to
be robbed. What makes it a great yarn is
the girl being in it. Everybody knows her,
you know. It's only a couple of weeks since
Yorbey wrote her up as the Coming Aero-
planiste. That’s chiefly the reason why I
CUTTING IT SHORT.
“Will you be mine — er—Angelina? I’ll love
you and cherish you and protect you , and
— er — er—all that bally rot, you know.
Eh? What? ”
starred the story so big. But it was a great
item of news, anyhow.”
“It was damn bad copy,” the printer
growled. "Young Norbey’s copy’s bad enough
any time, but when you hustle him—! A
column and a quarter of that stuff at two
o’clock in the morning!”
“Not a real column and a quarter,” the
sub said appeasingly. “Remember it’s got
leads all the way through.”
From which brief dialogue it will be seen
that Norbey’s intoxicated brain had achieved
its revenge well and truly, and under serious
physical disabilities.
* * * *
The great advantage of telling a story
after the event is that you can relate, with
knowledge, what happened on each side of a
shut door.
Mary Lowry, only daughter of the mag-
nate irreverently called Old Spoopendyke
by a sub-editor, might easily go to a Masked
Cinderella under lax chaperonage, for she
had no mother to go with her. Being un-
conventional, she might easily come home
under male escort; and if a French window
was left unlocked for her by her maid, there
is no reason why the escort should not come
into the house with her, to talk a few
minutes longer. They might even converse
in her own pet little sitting-room, “in all
honor,” as the smug Tennyson remarks. But
no amount of unconventionality will excuse
such a disturbance of furniture as will
awaken a heavy father who has all the
pugnacious instincts of a money-making
man.
When the loud, blundering footsteps of old
Lowry, or Spoopendyke, were heard in the
passage-way, Charlie Meyer, the aeronaut,
did the only possible thing. He pushed the
dismayed girl into the nearest door—it hap-
pened to be the door of her bedroom. lie
pulled his coat rapidly-over his evening dress,
whipped a black mask from his pocket, and
crushed hat and mask together on his head
and face. Aeronauting teaches men to think
quickly. Then, as Lowry rushed in, Meyer
rushed out. But the old man got hold of the
flying skirt of his coat.
Mary did the wildest thing imaginable—
she squealed. So she woke her maid. The
maid was out of bed in time to hear an
avalanche, or a dog fight, or something of
the sort doing a sensational waltz act down
the stairway, and to switch on every light
she could find. Then Mary stopped squeal-
ing. She volplaned downstairs, with the
maid behind her.
The next bit of the melodrama was what
Norbey saw before he bolted. While he was
colliding with pillar-boxes, and neglecting
to apologise, the Lowry family and the
Lowry maid were in Mary’s sitting-room.
Mary was recovering from hysteria on the
sofa. The maid Louise was busy at a dress-
ing-table, on which there was a tray of mis-
cellaneous jewellery.
“Stop that!” Lowry commanded. “Louise,
is anything missing?”
“I am afraid,” said the maid, standing
with her hands behind her, “two or three of
Miss Mary’s rings”
“All right, go to bed,” Lowry said fiercely.
“No; don’t go at once. Ring up the
police.”
Louise left the room, with her hands in
front of her.
A little later a senior-constable with a
large, yellow moustache, was sitting in the
room, trying to write in a black book, with
a stubby pencil, a verbatim statement of
what Lowry was saying to him. In the end
Lowry roared, and said that he would wait
for the detective police next day. But the
senior-constable was useful. He found two
of the three missing rings. They were on
the hall floor, not far from the telephone
box. Louise had not dared to throw them
far. Rings make a lot of noise, if thrown
from a distance on to a polished floor.
"Dropped in the scuffle,” the policeman
remarked sagaciously.
A scared, dazed Harold Norbey opened his
newspaper next morning with a hand that
shook, and read it with a glassv eye, while
his vital organs slowly sank until they slid
away through his boots. Oh, that accusing
morning moment of recollection and realisa
tion!
It is a serious thing to sell a newspapo
in that fashion. To be careless and irre
sponsible is a trifle. That ends by giving
the reporter great experience and confidence,
for it makes it absolutely certain that he
will travel happily and by stages round the
English-speaking world—Australia. Britain.
Canada. Maoriland and the United States.
He may shift from newspaper to newspaper
without trouble. But to misuse your paper
brings the black mark which is eternal dam-
nation. Seeing that wildly dramatic column
in irrevocable print, Norbey knew that now,
henceforth and for ever had he closed to
himself every door of journalism that is
worth entering.
Doomed and repentant, he went into the
city with the exact feelings of a man who
is off to say good-morning to his executioner.
He felt stifled, until the thing should be
over. His steps went straight to the Eagle
office, terribly though he needed a drink.
No letter of summons awaited him in his
room. Well, he would sit down until the
letter came. He opened his various recep-
tacles and began to look through them
mechanically... .A boy from the sub-editor’s
room appeared. So. it had come.
“Wanted downstairs,” the boy said in the
laconic language of his kind. “Sent to look
for you.”
The sub-editor was in the sub-editor’s
room. So was the chief of staff. So was
John Joseph Lowry, Esq. Norbey marched
into the room feeling as if his head was
already on a charger.
“What has caused my wonder,” Lowry was
saying ponderously, “was the exact accu-
racy of the story. I could never have be-
lieved that that ass of a policeman took my
information in so well. Why, every detail
of the fight is there. ’Pon my soul, I don’t
want to brag, but I dealt with the fellow ;
my word I did. If this is the young man, I
congratulate him on his quick grip and his
ready pen. He might have been there!—
from the very moment I saw the villain
grabbing the jewellery, and seized him by
the throat —but there, there, I mustn’t boast.
The police ought to get the scoundrel. He’ll
have my marks on him sure enough. You
got the tale from the policeman, hey?”
Norbey was silent.
“Ho, ho!” the magnate smiled largely.
“Never give anybody away; is that it?
Well, it’s a sound rule. But without dis-
paraging Miss Lowry, who was plucky
enough, no doubt, your account rather over-
draws the part she played when I was forc-
ing him to unmask. To tell you the truth,
she was rather in the way just then. But
your description of his features is accurate.
I remembered him even more distinctly when
I read my paper to-day. The police tell me
that the description corresponds very closely
with that of a most notorious criminal whom
they have watched for a long time.”
“Yes, I guessed they would say that,”
Norbey answered evenly.
“Hey? You know these villains, too, I
dare say,” Lowry chuckled. “Sleuths of the
press ! Sleuths of the press ! I think some
of our men could show the Detective Office
the way round. Hey?”
“We’re so-so, Mr. Lowry,” said the chief
of staff. And somehow at that moment
Norbey knew that he wasn’t going to be
sacked. It was, by the way, the Assistant
Shipping Reporter who went instead. He
became an insurance agent, and his two
boys were soon adepts with office broojns.
Various persons think various thoughts as
the result of this brief series of incidents.
Mary Lowry thinks that Charlie Meyer
is the coolest and cleverest man in the world,
and admires most of all the stroke of genius
which made him carry the rings from her
dressing-table to the hall floor. But she is
sorry that the prettiest ring of all disap-
peared. She believes that the policeman got
it.
Charlie Meyer thinks that aeroplaning is
safer than society experience.
John Joseph Lowry thinks that every man
who looks at him in the street is a potential
burglar, deterred from entering his house by
knowledge of his exploits. _
Louise thinks, concerning Mary Lowry,
the kind of things which become familiar
as evidence when maids appear as divorce-
court witnesses. She also thinks, and says
to her betrothed: “How lucky that I was
able to get the ring honestly, when I was
so often tempted to steal it!”
Brookes, who on that nisrht smuggled two
or three small items to the Eagle by a
friendly hand, thinks that Norbey is a dirty
thief with whom it is unsafe to work on
terms of trust.
The Detective Office thinks that the uni-
formed policeman deliberately kept, it in
ignorance, in order to get the limelight in
the Eagle’s report.
William Da,vid Davis, aged 43. Anglican,
tattoo on left arm, gaol number thinks
that it is a bewildering and a cursed thing
to get two years for a job you knew nothing
about until you saw it in the papers. He
is convinced that alibi evidence,, however
true, is no good if the cops are against you.
The copy-boy, who knows that burglaries
which happen at 12.30 a.m. cannot possibly
be circumstantially described in an edition
which goes to press at 1.45 a.m., thinks
scandalous romance concerning Harold
Norbey and Mary Lowry, each of whom he
secretly adores.
What Harold Norbey thinks may be
judged from what he said, the night before
last, to a cub reporter on the Eagle. The
cub. fresh from a scene of slaughter, com-
plained that he had got a “rotten” interview
from an eye-witness. Whereupon Norbey
ordered him to write the interview afresh,
and added: —
The memory of an excited man is a queer thing,
my son. What he will read in the paper to-morrow
morning will print itself more deeply on his mind
than what he saw to-night. Always remember that,
my tender suckling, when you are on a Real Big
Sensation.
“So I can grow up to be His Royal High
Swankiness, like Lord Norbey,” the cub
sneered, after Norbey had left the room.

Grass and Stars.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
STARS ! Stars ! Stars in the grass
Under September skies,
Splashes of opal on sapphire glass,
The cloud-ships come and the cloud-ships
pass
Watched by your million eyes!
Amethyst eyes in the green below —
Say, did ye tell me true,
That here and there, as the cloud-ships blow,
Under the awnings and sails of snow
Star-folk are watching you?
Once I dreamed that I sailed afar
On wings of a windy day,
Beyond the blue where the cloud-ships are,
Pilots they gave me of star and star
Over the Milky Way!
But never a star in the Milky Way
Was dear as the stars I knew,
So I came back where the cloud-ships stray,
Back on the wings of a windy day,
Back to the earth—and you !
Stars! Stars! Stars in the grass
Ever you seem to me

And ever in fancy the veiled priests pass
Chanting "Alirabile!”

Marriage Ideals.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF it hadn’t been for that dance Babette
and I might never have found out the
real meaning of marriage: we might
have gone blindly on in the belief that
marriage was merely a kind of dwindling
and shrinking honeymoon—instead of which,
of course, it is an entirely different thing,
as distinct and distant from the honeymoon
as the honeymoon is from one’s bachelor-
hood.
Babette and I had been looking forward
to that dance. For at the same ball, in the
same ballroom, with the same hostesses,
two years before I had for the first time met
Babette. Curious! I was very nearly not
going.... and it was the merest chance
that Babette was there. If her frock hadn’t
come home at the last minute if I hadn’t
happened to remember the date.... well,
this history would never have been written,
and I should not have discovered how
different marriage is to one’s ideals of it.
That night I met Babette I had been full of
ideals.
Since our marriage Babette and I had
declined all dances. My wife said frankly
that she didn’t see the necessity for losing
hours of sleep jigging around a room when
she could be in bed. I agreed. Still, this
dance was a different matter. Babette
thought it was our duty to show ourselves.
“They want to exhibit us, that’s all,”
she explained, “as an example of what
might happen to other people who are care-
less enough to go to dances.... And it ought
to be rather fun, oughtn’t it, dear? Just
to recall that wonderful first night when
we met! I feel sure I’ll enjoy it
immensely.”
Poor child! she did not guess as she
arrayed her beautiful self in the least
possible amount of clothes sanctioned by
chaperones that she was dressing for a
funeral. That night witnessed the decent
interment of our marriage ideals.
Until I was engaged to Babette I had
never thought much about marriage. I
conceived it with as much distinctness as I
conceived Heaven —a vague place, full of
vague delights; but a strange land a long
way off, about which there would be plenty
of time to think when, if ever, I srot there.
But when Babette proposed to me —she did
it, of course, very nicely and gently, so as
not to make me feel uncomfortable—
suddenly my nebular visions of marriage
took a definite and distinct shape. After
Babette, with true womanly intuition and
tact, had got me safely over the awkward-
ness of the proposal, she allowed me to
dream of marriage. Indeed, she even
encouraged me to dream. But this dream
was not in the least like my earlier dreams.
It had a focus. I felt that it was not a
strange country I was so perilously voyaging
to, but a land where I would find at least
one familiar face. I was not merely going
tc get married —any fellow can do that if
he can find a girl considerate enough to
propose to him —but I was going to do
something that nobody else in all the long
centuries of history had ever succeeded in
doing. I was going to marry Babette. I
used to wonder how anybody else had ever
had the pluck to marry, for there was only
one Babette in the world. The only
explanation I could find for those notices
I saw every day in the “Marriages”
column of the paper was the conjecture that
all women are Babettes. Which is absurd.
In my vivid vision, then, I saw Babette
my wife, the centre of my home. I had
lived long in boarding-houses; and my dream
of a home was a place as different from
a boarding-house as Babette’s nose was
from all the other noses in Christendom.
I would come home tired out with my w 7 ork
at the office —really, my work at the office
wasn’t in the least exhausting, but one likes
one’s wife to preserve, at least, one illusion
about oneself; else, how would we husbands
keep our wives’ respect? I would come
wearily home, with a quickening step as I
saw Babette patiently waiting at the front
gate. (As it happened, that phase lasted
just five weeks.) Or, on a wet day she
would run to the door as she recognised my
ring. And, though with electric bells one
ring is just like another, Babette’s wifely
intuition would recognise it and run. (She
ran to the door 38 times. After that I
bad to use my latch-key—which, after all,
D what a latch-key is for.)
And when I entered my wife would
smother me with kisses. (She smothered
me for a fortnight, kissed me for nine more
weeks, peeked me for the succeeding three
and a half months; and after that I forgot
to notice whether she pecked or not.) So
I would go in, and she would seize my hat
and my coat and hang them up. giving each
of them a little kiss, conveying to me in her
flutter and her talk the soothing sensation
that in some miraculous way she had
rescued me from a bleak and dangerous
world outside. She had got me home from
the wild and wicked wilderness of men. And
before the fire I would find a comfortable
easy chair — my chair, jealously reserved for
me, never occupied by herself unless I
happened to be sitting in it myself; and.
toasting in the warmth of the fire, my com-
fortable home slippers would await my
weary feet. I could visualise those slippers
in detail; for they were the ones she
embroidered for me in the first week of our
engagement—embroidered with dear, fan-
tastic, virginal Babettish dreams. At least,
she gave them to me in the first week of our
engagement. I found out accidentally that
she had begun them two months earlier—
the week after we had met at that
providential dance. Women have an un-
canny intuition sometimes.
(She seized my hat 14 times, kissed it 13
times, hung it up 12 times. The comfortable
chair was ready and reserved for me for
nearly ‘three weeks. Then it began to be
occupied by Babette’s sewing—no, not
darning, sewing. Then it began to be
difficult to find, smothered beneath the white
blizzard of Babette’s sewing. The slippers
toasted themselves for six weeks. Then I
had to fish them out of a corner, and I
found a needle in the left one.)
But it was darning that I most looked
forward to. It is true that as a bachelor
I could usually prevail upon my motherly
landlady, or some motherly spinster,
surreptitiously to darn my socks for me.
But I confess I looked forward with delight
to the picture of my Babette daintily darn-
THE DIFFERENCE.
FINANCIAL POTENTATE (to needy visitor): “This is an Financial Potentate (to lady canvasser
age of harsh commercialism, my good friend. of engaging appearance):
There is no loom for sentiment in business .”
ing my socks in the evening while I smoked
my pipe. That picture expressed my ideal
of domesticity, (Babette darned my socks
for five weeks, and sewed on three buttons.
After that she rather let things go. It was
not that Babette wasn’t fond of sewing:
she revelled in sewing. But not darning.
She never had time for darning: she was
always busy over “hand-work” for herself.
“Darning,” she said, “was no white
woman’s work.” She had a sewing machine,
but she refused to use it when she was
making those piles of white things _ she
seemed to require and wear out so quickly.
But I must admit that she did not altogether
neglect my socks. About once a month I
would find every available sock put away
neatly, and every one of them exquisitely
darned. Then I knew that she must have
invited her mother down to spend the
afternoon.)
And to my wife I would tell all my
business worries. Really, being on a salary,
I had no business worries. But I would
pour them all out into Babette’s sympathetic
ear; and she would cheer me up and coddle
me and cuddle me, and with her soft hand
smooth away all the wrinkles from my brow.
(But I never got time to discourse on my
worries—Babette was always so busy
telling me hers. They were mostly ser-
vants.)
Well, it wasn’t at all like my ideal....
but there were compensations. You see, I
had had the luck to marry Babette.
I hurried home, the day of the dance, to
find Babette two-thirds dressed. She
triumphantly informed me that she had done
her hair. It really looked like it.
In my dressing-room I found all my even-
ing clothes laid out on the bed. That’s one
advantage of being married. As a bachelor
I had had to ransack drawers and hunt for
gold studs and discover my dancing pumps
and my gloves. It was true that Babette
had laid out the wrong white shirt (with
the frayed edge) and had chosen the wrong
tie; but it was thoughtful of her.
We had a hasty and dishevelled dinner;
for, as Babette said, what with dressing and
shaving all the afternoon, she had not had a
moment to spare to see to the cooking.
“And, besides,” she aptly added, “we can
make up at supper, can’t we?”
I did not enjoy that dance. Of course
with Babette it was different. She still held
fast to her illusions, poor child. I was
proud enough when this radiant, shimmer-
ing thing (with the clean-shaven arms) put
her arm in mine for the first dance; and I
had no need to shepherd partners to her
programme. She was blockaded with eager
youths. At the supper dance, which, of
course, we had together, she asked me as
a favor whether I would greatly mind giving
up the other two dances I had still left
to me with her.
“You know, dear, you do two-step so
dreadfully, don’t you? And there’s a
perfectly ideal dancer who suits my steps
adorably. And I’ve only had one dance with
him.”
“But,” I began, “I was looking forward
to those dances. It isn’t so much the
dancing with you that I like. I just wanted
to sit out and talk.”
“Oh, we can talk when we get home,
can’t we?” she brightly suggested.
That had not occurred to me before.
“Besides, you know that you’re just dying
for a smoke,” she added.
The irony of that remark lay in the fact
that I was.
My partners did not attract me. They
didn’t understand my repartee. They didn’t
even try to. I discovered then that I had
educated Babette up to my sense of humor.
I: had been a long and sometimes depressing
process; but in the end Babette learned
always to smile at the right place. And I
wasn’t going to start the process all over
again with each new partner.
The romance of that dance two years
before was missing, too. Then there had
been nobody in the ballroom but Babette.
Now she was merely my wife. I recalled,
while smoking my cigarette during those
two dances she had with the ioeal dancer
instead of her husband, that two years
before she had just as easily slipped up
another partner—for me. I wasn’t married
to her then, of course. Those two stolen
dances! We had sat them out on some
secluded, cold steps—-the sort of place where
one would never think of sitting on a cold
night without an overcoat except at a dance.
And I had apologised for kissing Babette on
the shoulder.
And this evening I had led Babette to
the same cold, secluded steps ; and, man and
wife, we had recalled our first wondrous
acquaintance. I had assured Babette that
she was even more delectable as a married
woman that she had been two years before;
and to prove it I had kissed her passionately
on the same bare shoulder.
And yet....it wasn’t the same shoulder,
the same Babette, and yet....not the same.
Or, rather, it was the same —that was the
trouble. The same shoulder that since I
had so often lightly kissed, usually when we
were in bed. The thrill had got worn off.
But Babette never noticed the difference.
She adorably thrilled. I was thankful that,
at least, for her, the romance had not worn
thin.
And there was not the same fun in seeing
Babette home. How well I remembered the
first time I had seen her home ! And how
long we had taken to say good-night in the
cleverly-shaded porch! And how hungry I
felt afterwards ! Well!. . . .You can’t have
your cake and eat it. But I had not my
cake, and I had not even eaten it. Marriage
had eaten it.
When we got home Babette made me
unhook her. To my surprise there was no
difficulty about that. There were no hidden
hooks, no cast-iron rivets, no taut tapes. I
untied a tiny ribbon bow, detached a few
flimsy hooks and five pins, and the filmy dress
simply flowed to her feet. And there she
stood, a charming boy! For she had adopted
the newest fashion. She had dispensed with
everything else. She stood, alluring, in silk
tights and openwork. She looked as if she
had just stepped from beneath the shower.
“I say,” I asked in consternation, “is that
all you had on at the dance?”
“Of course,” she smiled. “Didn’t I look
smart?”
“Yes, but.... Just that slip of a flimsy
dress over you—nothing between you and
nakedness but that thin wrap? Were all the
other”....
“Of course,” she smiled. “But surely you
knew ?”
I confessed that I had my suspicions. I
had noticed that despite the new cling or
cinch in modern dancing, no corsets had stuck
their jagged ends into me. And with some
of my partners I had the feeling that I was
waltzing with a jelly-fish. Not altogether an
unpleasant feeling. 8ut.... only a flimsy
covering between respectability and a bathing
costume!
It wasn’t as if there was any real need for
any of the women to uncover themselves any
further. Even in Babette’s full-dress costume
there was a considerable amount of undis-
guised Babette on view. Her head was
thickly covered with hair and pad. Then
there was some uncovered face and neck and
shoulder and bosom and back. Then, how
held up I do not know, began the top ot
Babette’s evening gown. This discreetly con-
tinued to her ankles, but was so tightly
built that in order to allow 7 her to dance the
costumier had mercifully provided a slit to
the knee. And even her knee w 7 as rather chill-
ingly clad. For she wore the openworkest ot
openwork stockings, guaranteed to last at
least one dance without dissolving into
nothingness. And now that she had flowed
out of her gown—it weighed nine ounces —
Babette, though still presumedly fully
clothed, gave me a spotted effect of Babette
and lace —mostly Babette.
“That is why I asked you to watch me in
the second dance,” she explained. “This skirt
is so difficult to lift. I’d hate to let people
see too much of me. You wouldn’t like it
yourself, you know. Still, you needn’t have
signalled so publicly. Was I holding it very
high ?”
“I saw 7 your knee.”
“Really,” she sighed. “My dressmaker
should have been more careful. Still, what’s
the use of an expensive dress if it isn’t
smart?”
It w 7 as with a sigh of relief that she dis-
carded her bathing dress for her nightie. Her
nightie was warmer, less like wire-netting.
“I wonder,” I mused, “if women are ever
really comfortable except when they’re in
bed ?”
•plow could um be comfortable w r ith all
those things on?” she replied.
I heaved a long silence.
“I didn’t enjoy it the teeniest bit,” she
sighed. “Dances used to be so awfully
exciting; but that was before we were
married, wasn’t it? You know a girl goes
to a dance filled with the most impossible
hopes. She never knows what nice man she
may* meet; she doesn’t even know which of
her two favorite partners will see her home.
I always arranged to have two men madly
devoted to me at every dance I went to. One
by himself w r as rather a nuisance. But now
I’m married. I know who will
take me home. Of course,” she
said penitently, “I wouldn’t be
single again for worlds. There
was that Grace Browne there
to-night; she’s been going to
dances long before I came out,
and she’s getting haggard now
with hoping. But, after all,
it’s for the Grace Brownes that
dances were invented. They’re
not for married women, are
they? There’s no excitement
in them. It’s all different, isn’t
it? Marriage, I mean.”
So Babette had had her little
ideals, too! I was startled,
hurt.
“You mean that you’re dis-
appointed ?”
“Not exactly disappointed...
disillusioned, perhaps.”
“I’ve been a failure as a
husband?” I said bitterly.
“Oh, no ! It’s not you ; it’s
marriage that lias been a
failure.”
“Our marriage, Babette?”
“No, dear. Not you, not me;
but just marriage. Any
marriage every marriage.
There’s something wrong in it.
It isn’t what it’s been cracked
up to be, is it? I suppose it’s
those novelists. I was a silly
little fool. All girls are. We
don’t know, you see. And
there’s only one way of finding
out; and when we do find out
it isn’t what we expected, but
we’ve got to make the best of
it. Even when there was
nothing to find out, after all
Oh, well!
“But it changes us. To-night, for instance.
1 liked dancing with you,” she nicely
conceded ; “but I didn’t get the thrill. And
when you took me out to sit on those same
cold steps—l was hoping, longing tnat you
would —and you kissed me on the shoulder,
it seemed rather a silly thing for you to do —-
that is. for a husband to do. I’m sorry,
dreadfully sorry, dear, but I couldn’t feel
that kiss. It didn’t tingle all through me,
and trickle up and down my spine, and burn
me right through to the bone. And all the
time I was thinking hnw cold those steps
were—and how cold I was.”
“Babette!” I cried, shocked.
Her voice was penitent. “Oh, I know you
felt just the same, you old darling; and I
couldn’t have disillusioned you. So I pre-
tended, for your sake, that it was just the
same as the first time. That first kiss on
my shoulder shook me like an earthquake. I
pretended that I was hurt and scandalised.
But the only thing I was worried about was
whether the rubbed-off powder would show
when we got back to the ballroom. That was
why I made you sit out another —to give the
red mark time to disappear. And you didn’t
give it a chance! But, really, I didn’t care.
I _ was proud, tremendously proud. But to-
night. . . .well, wdiat’s a shoulder to kiss when
you’re able and allowed to kiss it any time.”
There was nothing else for me to do. I
kissed much of Babette. But it didn’t make
any difference. We were married.
“Do you know.” she said, quite calmly—
I could feel her heart against my arm beat-
ing with a serene, unhurried steadiness —“I
had all sorts of wonderful ideals about mar-
riage ; and they’re all faded. Once you
kissed me every morning at breakfast —once,
you remember”—l didn’t —“when we were
both eating poached eggs—and I loved it. But
you’ve not kissed me at breakfast since last
August—August the third. And —oh, what’s
the use? We’re married. Marriage has got
us. That’s all.”
So there it was. The electroplate was
wearing off.
“Oh. I love you, of course,” she went on;
“but in a married way. And I wouldn’t be
single again for' anything. But I made the
mistake about it a: wage that all girls make.
I thought it would be exciting; but it isn’t.
It’s dull.”
“Marriage is dull,” I assented soberly.
“But it’s a pleasant sort of dullness, isn’t
it?”
Babette sighed. “A happy, contented sort
of dullness.”
She snuggled desperately closer.

those who have read only his JOAN OF ARC or THE
PRINCE AND THE PAUPER think of him as a
great romancer; those who are acquainted only with
INNOCENTS ABROAD or ROUGHING IT think of
him as inexpressibly funny; those who are familiar
only with his essays look upon him as a sane and
indignant foe of hypocrisy; those who have read
only his short stories, such as A DEATH MASK,
think of him as a master of pathos ; but those only
who have read all these books know or can realise
the transcendent genius of MARK TWAIN, those only
can comprehend the limits of intellectual effort, those
only know that MARK TWAIN the philosopher, Mark
Twain the humorist, Mark Twain the dreamer, and
Mark Twain the reformer are all but parts of the
greatest American of his time.
Every Novel, every Book of Travel, every Essav,
in short, everything of MARK TWAIN’S contained in

A Modern Commentary.
The Century Bible illustrated is an Encyclopaedia

The Book of the Motor-Car.
These are three up-to-date modern books, which will
give every motor-car or cycle-car owner a wealth of
information about the machine he possesses.
Being just fresh from the press, right up-to-date,
it not only contains the description of all the
various engines at present on the market, but has a
number of invaluable suggestions on modern and some
future eng'ines. By having this book the ordinary
car-owner is thoroughly abreast of his time, and its
value will be very quickly saved by the knowledge
it will give him of what really counts in a car, and
how to overcome those absurd annoyances which, too
often, he is quite unfitted to cope with ; instead of
being the master he is the servant. This book will
show him how to enjoy his machine to the fullest.
To the private owner of a motor-car there is no
instrument which will save more worry, cost and
trouble than this publication. It is as needful to a
garage as a lifting-jack.
Many hundred copies have been sold in the last
few weeks, and all owners and chauffeurs are most
strongly recommended to become familiar with the
particulars of this work. This is the first really com-
prehensive work on cycle-cars.

The Supreme Master of the Short Story.
This title belongs exclusively to Henri Rene Guy
de Maupassant, whose complete works we now have
the honor to put before the Australian public. This
is the definite edition in 17 Volumes, and is only
procurable from ourselves.
The translation has given entire satisfaction to
book-lovers, whilst the technical production of this
edition is of the very best. This edition will only be
sold to recognised book-lovers or literary students.
As Elbert Hubbard says, “de Maupassant of all
writers has suffered most from misunderstanding.
He has been crucified on the brazen cross of ignor-
ance. He writes as old Walt used to write, with the
same full grown freedom, but with a gentler touch.”

Modern Buildings.
The purpose of this book is to put before readers
in a single work all the essential parts of a modern
building, describing modern methods of planning
and construction almost side by side as they naturally
occur in the actual work, and taking all in a logical
sequence.
It being impossible for a single writer to produce
so large a work and to be master of all the subjects
with which it deals, the system has been followed of
placing the book under the control of one author,
who has been assisted by a very large and specially
selected staff whose work he carefully supervises. The
whole work is thus brought into perfect harmony.
The author was thus able to keep steadily in view
that he was addressing everyday intelligent men,
with the object of displaying his subject in clear and
simple language.
The Volume contains over 1500 illustrations in
color, half-tone and line, and is edited by G. A. T.
Middleton, A.R.1.8.A., assisted by the finest architects
in the world. The Australian Section of the work
is from the pen of that eminent specialist, Mr. R. J.
Haddon, F.R.1.8.A., F.R.V.1.A., F.S.A.I.A.

The Book of Modern Engines and
Power Generators.
This is the most important work on the subject
ever published, and it can be strongly recommended
to all classes of Engineers. It is a compact work of
reference on all Power subjects upon which he is
likely to seek practical assistance and information.
This publication is the only one extant which deals
with every type of Prime Mover, and is written
expressly for practical Engineers. It is of para-
mount importance to the Engineer to have at least a
practical working acquaintance with all kinds of
Prime Movers.
The Book of Modern Generators shows him the
best examples to follow in every branch of the busi-
ness connected with Prime Movers and the transmis-
sion of their powers.

Modern Veterinary Adviser.
This work is a successful attempt to give full
instructions for the treatment of all animals, and
while telling how to prevent disease it lays special
strain on how to keep the animals in vigorous health.
The one great aim of the Editor and his colleagues
has been to be eminently practical. Thousands of
animal lovers are placed in circumstances which pre-
vent their obtaining ready expert assistance. In
many other cases the ailments are trifling, and such
as a modern educated parent knows how to deal with
in the case of a child.
As is often the case in human medicine, the pro-
fessional expert is sent for too late. It is therefore
of first importance that owners of animals should
know what they can safely and wisely do for them-
selves and what others can do for them. That
knowledge is the special object of this book to
impart.

How to Succeed in Business.
The “Business Encyclopaedia” deals only with
Business, but it treats of this great subject ex-
haustively and fully. The fact that there are over

In the “Business Encyclopaedia’’ the ambitious
young man will find every detail relating to the
hundreds of matters on which he wishes to inform

The Most Misunderstood Man in
England.
THE STANDARD EIRE OF DAVID IXOYD
GEORGE.
To half the English-speaking world David Lloyd
George represents the leadership of the forces of
darkness. To the other half he is the very Apostle
of Light. He is, indeed, the most misunderstood
man in England to-day. For both friend and oppo-
nent—Liberal and Conservative alike—are far re-
moved from any real understanding of a man whose
career is without a parallel in the annals of English
politics.
For that reason, the Standard “Life of David
Lloyd George,” by Herbert du Parcq, M.A., 8.C.L.,
presents an irresistible appeal to people of all shades
of political thought. It is not merely the life-story
of a remarkable man; it is the revelation of the
character of a man who has exercised a tremendous
influence on the whole trend of English politics.

A Romance of Blackberries and a
Kingly Soul.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE sands of time were somewhat wet,
The board was set with mugs of beer,
The maiden’s hair was black as jet,
The harper’s singing drew a tear;
The elements of hold romance
Were in the minstrel person’s glance.
All day the dogs had chased the stag
And failed to catch him in the end,
Therefore the huntsman could not brag
That fortune was his special friend;
And thus it came to pass, you see.
They only had boiled pork for tea.
Boiled pork for those beneath the salt,
But sausages for those above,
And all the company had malt,
While two at least were fed with love,
For when the harper sang again
He tried to make his meaning plain.
He sang about a Baron’s girl
Who loved the man that made the noise,
Whose beauty was a perfect pearl
Admired by all the princely boys
That jousted by the castle moats
And tried to cut each other’s throats.
He sang about the harping man
Whose whiskers in the wind would wave.
His voice before the row began
Encouraged others to be brave,
And after most of them were slain
Advised the rest to try again.
The harper that he sang about
Was sweet upon the winsome maid,
So, e’er her father found them out,
He took her to a forest glade,
And, to their large and mutual bliss,
Administered one sweet, chaste kiss.
Then through the woods on every side
The Baron’s men came riding fast.
And caught him with his promised bride
E’er half a wild, sweet hour was past,
And ranging round him loudly swore
To make him one small piece of gore.
The harper by his damsel stood,
He looked liis foemen in the eye,
And swore by George and Holy Rood
He would not deign one foot to fly,
Then lifted off his wig and cap
And gave his brawny chest a rap.
The men-at-arms, in sudden awe
Dropped from their horses on their knees.
It was their sovereign that they saw
Beside the maid between the trees;
And then the woods began to ring
While all men sang: “Gor’ Save the King.”
Thus ended all the harper’s tale.
The knight applauded long and loud,
The maiden sat a trifle pale,
Then blushed and o’er her liquor bowed ;
And as the night got very drunk
Most of the crowd in beer were sunk.
Quenched were the lights. The maiden rose,
And, passing towards the postern stair.
Plucked gently at the harper’s hose
And drew him sweetly from his chair,
And down they went into the night,
Leaving the hall behind them tight.
Then forth they fared into the wood
And wandered on till break of day,
The harper in a merry mood
Singing a jocund roundelay ;
And when the happy sun uprist
They went behind a tree and kist.
The blackberries were hardly ripe,
They ate a fewat breakfast time;
The cheerful minstrel lit his pipe
And soothed his lady’s soul with rhyme.
And so they went along till lunch
Brought more green blackberries to crunch.
The maiden wandered far away,
The knight was far too drunk to care,
The minstrel had no cash to pay
For anything to eat or wear.
At times they longed for beef and tripe,
But soon the blackberries got ripe.
And still the maiden tripped along
Upon her artless lover’s arm,
And heard him sing a cheerful song
Which did not do her any harm;
Always she hoped the hour would bring
Some chance to prove the bard a king.
But years passed by and still they went
Along the greenwood’s tangled way,
With simple blackberries content.
The harper’s whiskers turned to grey,
The damsel holding still the myth
’Twas Richard Rex; not William Smith.

CURSE O' MOSES.
The Stop-out.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
French windows stood wide open.
I The light of a midsummer morn
filtered through lace curtains, flooded
the room with pearly light. The clock in
the dining-room chimed half-past something,
and Mrs. Wageter cocked her ear and
listened.
Only perfect quiet, punctuated by the
syncopated breathing of Mr. Wageter on the
outer edge of the bed. She sat up, a
plumply pleasing woman in an embroidered
nightdress. Turning as if on a pivot, she
slid deftly to the floor, and picking up an
electric torch, toddled across the room to
where Mr. Wageter’s watch lay on the dress-
ing-table. A flash of the torch showed
her that it was half-past one. She returned
to the bedside and prodded her husband in
the ribs.
“Tom,” she wailed, flashing the light
alternately in his own face and that of his
watch, “wake up ! It has just struck half-
past one.” , , . . ,
Sleepily he protested his innocence, and
she prodded him some more. .
“Half-past one, Tom ! And Tommy isn’t
home yet. J
Mr.’Wageter failed to realise the import-
ance of the statement
“Look at the time,” she insisted, but he
only mumbled something about the watch
being fast. . „ T , A
“Oh, it’s fast, is it? Well, I never! Any-
how, your precious son is mighty late in
getting home,”
“Isn’t the young beggar home yet?”
“You know he isn’t, Tom Wageter, and
don’t you lie there pretending that you
think he is.”
“He might have missed his tram.”
“He could miss forty trams and still be
home before half-past one.”
“Of course, my dear. Hut you must re-
member that Tommy isn’t in short pants
now.”
“No —nor in his pyjamas, either, which is
where he ought to be even if he were ten
times twenty-one last Tuesday.”
“Yes! yes, to be sure—eh! Half-past
one and one-and-twenty.” Something in the
euphony of the phrase appealed to Mr.
Wageter, and he hummed it over like a tag
from a comic opera. Glancing over his
shoulder at the moonlit sky he added, “And
a lovely night they’re having for it, too.”
“Tom Wageter, you’re a beast,” cried his
wife, smiting him with a blinding flash from
the torch as an offended Juno might have
hurled a spare thunderbolt at an offending
Jove. “A beast —just a beast to sit there
and —and—and” There was a hint of
tears in her voice, so Mr. Wageter sat up
and temporised.
“My dear kid, Tommy’s all right. You
dip hack into bed here and have a nice
snooze. I’ll wait up.”
“You ! You wait up !” She focussed the
torch full on his chest. “The moment your
head touches that pillow” (she turned the
spot light on it) “you’ll go fast asleep. And
you needn’t tell me to go to bed when you
know perfectly well that I never close an
eye until everybody is in, in this house. Did
you ever come home and not find me waiting
up for you?”
Mr. Wageter admitted that he had never
had that luck.
A PROPHETESS.
STEAMER-HAND (reporting to skipper): “Anchors dropped, sir!"
MISS FITT (to friend): “There! I knew it would from the careless way they let it lie
about the deck."
“And how do you know that Tommy is
all right?” she demanded, “Where would
any respectable person be until this hour
of the morning? Why didn’t he come home
to dinner? Why doesn’t he keep decent
hours? Why, it is half-past one and he isn’t
here.”
Mr. Wageter did not attempt to answer
any of these questions, so she propounded a
few more.
“When he found he wasn’t coming home
why didn’t he wire? Why don’t we have
the telephone on so that he could have rung
up? Why didn’t he say this morning where
he was going to-night?”
“Maybe he didn’t know.”
“Didn’t know! Why didn’t he know? Do
people wander round the streets all night
just for fun?”
Mr. Wageter’s smile seemed to suggest
the possibility of such a proceeding, and his
mirth irritated Mrs. Wageter considerably.
“Don’t sit there grinning at me,” she
cried. “If I did have the misfortune to
marry a callous-hearted wretch with no more
parental feeling than a —a —a tomato,
remember that it is my boy who is out
there.”
“There” seemed to be the North Bondi
corner of the bedroom ceiling, where the
torch spat a blob of light about the size of a
woman’s hat.
“Remember, I am his mother, and instead
of sitting there making silly faces you ought
to be teaching him his duty to me —his
regard for himself —his —his self-respect and
a whole lot of other things.”
Mr. Wageter sneezed, and his wife accused
him of a covert expression of contempt. So
he sneezed again to show her that the spasm
was quite involuntary. Her suspicions were
only half allayed, and her flow of eloquence
increased both in volume and velocity.
“And it is you he has to thank for it all.”
she hissed, waggling the torch under his
nose. “Many and many a time I’ve sat out
there on that balcony with Tommy, an
infant in my arms, shivering with cold,
dying for want of sleep, and you stopping
out until all hours and coming: home with a
breath that would poison a cat and a tale
about a tram off the line.”
Mr. Wageter hitched up his pyjamas and
walked across to the window.
“Oh. the yarns vou used to spin me.
When I think of them I go hot all over.
Not that I ever believed one of them, not
one. I listened, but I never believed one of
them : and here’s the result! Half-past one
—twenty minutes to two almost, and no
Tommy. He’ll be coming home _ next with
a fine tale, no doubt! I’ll tale him ! Come
back from that window! You’re worry
enough without me being bothered with you
having a cold !”
Mr. Wageter strangled a yawn and sat
down on his wife’s side of the bed.
“Get off my place,” she snapped. “If you
are so indifferent to my anxiety and your
son’s absence that you can’t keep awake, go
to bed properly, on your own side.” Again
the glare of the electric light hit him between
the eyes.
“For Godsake, Mary, put th’ damtliing
down! Do you want to blind me?”
“That’s it! Swear at me! Oh, if inno-
cent girls only knew what being married
meant.”
“Oh. give it a breeze. Do you want
Tommy to grow up a white-livered milk-
and-water son-of-a-gun—because I don’t.”
Mrs. Wageter went off on a new tack.
“What’s the police for if they let boys—
and Tommy’s only a boy—roam the streets
till this hour? Why don't they”
“Run them in? Oh, they do. if they don’t
behave themselves —quick and lively. My
word !”
Mr. Wageter emphasised his statement
with a nod and a wink. Evidently lie knew
what’ he was talking about. His wife
collapsed limply on the edge of the bed. her
hands in her lap. and a cone of light stream-
ing heavenward.
“If they’ve arrested Tommy,” she sobbed,
“I’ll never be able to hold up my head
again. You wouldn’t mind—you’ve a hide
like a hippopotamus, but—it would—kill—
me!”
Mr. Wageter sought to comfort her, and
as a preliminary he gently unlaced her
fingers from the torch and slipped it into
the breast pocket of his pyjamas, lie patted
her plump shoulder and took her in his
arms. Her ample bosom pressed heavily
upon his chest and upon the spring that
controlled the flash of the torch. A flame of
white light flung them apart.
“You brute!” she cried, tearing the lamp
from him and bringing the pocket with it.
“How dare you play tricks upon me?” _
The possession of the torch was the sign
regal of her dominance. Tucking the skirts
of her nightie round her, she marched out
of the room, and, preceded by a pillar of fire,
pit-patted downstairs. Wageter heard her
lighting the gas-ring and filling the tea-
kettle at the kitchen tap. lie fain would
have slept, but sleep was not for him while
Mrs. Wageter waked. So he found a cigar-
ette on the dressing-table, and, lighting it,
mused on the things that had been. In the
thin trails of smoke he saw a previous
Tommy Wageter, who also explored moonlit
streets. Many a time had he scouted round
his father’s house in the short hours that
precede the dawn, seeking unobtrusive
entrance. Even as he mused a shadow crept
across the patch of moonlit floor, and
Tommy’s head, projected beyond the window
frame, peered into the room. Wageter
masked the glowing end of his cigarette, and,
assured by the silence, Tommy junior, his
hat on the back of his head and his boots in
his hand, ventured in, and tiptoed with
cautious steps towards the door.
The silence was oppressive—even un-
natural. Surely his father had not for-
gotten how to snore. Impossible that those
flat planes of tumbled bedclothes could hide
his mother’s generous curves. Tommy
stopped, drew a long breath, reared himself
on his toes, and stared apprehensively at the
parental couch.
It was empty.
He took a firmer grip on his boots and
turned towards the balcony again.
“Tommy!” said his father, “won’t you
wait for breakfast?”
Tommy sank weakly on the seat at tue
bedfoot and smiled vacuously at his father.
Father frowned severely. ,
“Whadyoumean by coming home t this
hour th’ night?”
“I —I wanted to go to bed.”
“T’ bed, y’ young rascal? Ya oughta been
in bed hours ago. Hours and hours ago;
steddo fright’nin’ the soul out your poor
mother, upsettin’ th’ house, was tin y
money, ruinin’ y’ health, losin’ y’ s l e ?P’
aiakin’ me lose mine. Whadyoumeanbyit.
Sneakin’ in through th’ window ! Haven t
we a door?” ,
Tommy evaded the question and asked
where his mother was.
“You’ll know all about that presently, my
lad. As a matter o’ fact, she’s gone to make
herself a cup of tea. She’ll bring one in for
me, and I’ll have to drink it, an’ won’t be
able to go to sleep for hours. Why didn t
you come home to dinner?”
Dinner was so long ago, and so many
things had happened since then, that Tommy
had forgotten.
“Y’ oughta know b’ now that nobody gets
into this house without your mother know-
ing all about it. Why, I never once got
home between midnight and milk-o without
havin’ that flamin’ torch flashed in my face.
It’s dashed disconcertin’ havin’ a ten-candle
lamp sprung on you at that hour of the
mornin’. It makes you seem a lot sillier
than you really are.”
Tommy nodded in sympathetic agreement.
“An’ now you come buzzin’ home ’t a
most absurd hour. Y’ oughta know better !
I never come in at two, unless I’ve a rattlin’
good yarn to sp— I mean reason to give
for my bein’ late, and I’ll bet you’ve never
thought up nothing.”
Tommy shook his head, and the two nega-
tives made an affirmative.
“The tales I’ve told your mother would
have made my fortune if I’d had the time to
sit down and turn them into a book. One
that went well and stood repeatin’ was
about a juggins at the club, who always
played me a thousand up for a sovereign.
Of course your mother got the quid—you’d
be surprised how much money she’s won off
me at billiards that way.”
Tommy smiled, and his father was
encouraged to impart more wisdom.
“If I couldn’t get home by two I’d stay
out till three, or maybe four, and then she’d
be so jolly glad to see me that she’d hardly
say a word.”
“It must be getting on for three now,
said Tommy, making for the balcony, but his
father plumped him down on the settee
again.
“You stop there. Have you no considera-
tion for your mother? Do you want her to
give it to you an’ then have to go over it all
again to me? I hope to be asleep by three.
New, between man and man —whatavyou
been up to? I mean —what are you going
to tell your mother you were up to?”
“Er —r —tram?”
“No good after half-past twelve! Think
again.”
Tommy took his hat off and fanned him-
self with it.
“I’ve got it,” cried Mr. Wageter, but the
explanation died upon his lips, as Mrs.
Wageter labored up the creaking stairs,
accompanied by the rhythmic clink of spoons
and the faint aroma of hot tea.
Tommy was not quite at his ease, but his
father fairly beamed with self-confidence
and gave the high sign for silence. The
dramatic moment had arrived. The veteran
actor was about to take the centre of the
stage again and exhibit to a wondering gene-
ration. all his old time fecundity of fancy
and fluency of speech. He was again to lead
his audience by its ears, and by a clever
combination of simple sentences composed
of words to be found in any sixpenny dic-
tionary convert her from a keen sense of her
own wrongs to a lively interest in a tale yet
to be invented.
Truly a masterly performance.
He turned to open the door for her, but
she kicked it open and the edge caught him
on the nose. That torch flared upon the
unexpected figure seated at the bedfoot. The
cups fell from her nerveless hands and shat-
tered into a thousand pieces. The torch
winked as it hit the floor and left the room
in comparative darkness. Tommy dropped
his boots, clapped his hands to his eye, and
writhed in apparent agony.
What if the floor was flooded with hot
tea and strewn with broken crockery ? What
if Mr. Wageter’s nose shed a thin trickle of
blood, or that spilt tea leaves a horrid stain
upon white nightwear? A mother’s instinct
triumphed and Mrs. Wageter dropped on her
knees before her boy.
“Tommy, Tommy,” she pleaded, “mother
didn’t mean it to go in your eye.”
Tommy continued to writhe, and uttered a
half-suppressed groan.
“Damit,” cried his father. “You banged
the door on my nose and it’s bleeding.”
“Turn on the light.”
She was no longer a wife; she was a
mother. Mr. Wageter retrieved the torch
and flashed it at her.
“I said make a light, idiot!”
He threw the torch out of the window,
and. as it hit the street, it gave one flash
of unusual brilliance and was dark forever.
Then he lit the gas.
Mrs. Wageter examined her son’s eye.
Mr. Wageter inspected his own nose in the
hand-mirror.
“Don’t rub it, darling.”
“I’m not,” said Mr. Wageter.
“I’m not talking to you,” said his wife.
“Go and bring some hot water from the
kitchen—quick!”
She was the woman of action again; the
ministering angel. From a bag hung on the
washstand she drew narrow rolls of white
linen, ready for such emergencies as these.
She missed the wink that Tommy passed to
his father, but she found her smelling-salts
and pushed them under his nose.
“Sniff!” she commanded. “Sniff hard!
It will make your eyes water.” It nearly
made him cough his head off.
“If your old ass of a father hadn’t banged
his nose I wouldn’t have dropped the cups.”
Mr. Wageter entered and offered her the
tea kettle.
“Stupid,” she screamed; “what’s the good
of that?”
“Didn’t you tell me to bring the hot water?
There’s some in it!” and to prove his state-

Horlick’s Malted Milk
is the Universal Food.
There is practically no occa-
sion when Horlick’s is not
an appropriate beverage,
Summer and Winter alike
It is a Food-Drink, combin-
ing palatability with great
nutritive powers. Its
purity is incontestable
which, in these days of
adulterated Food Stuffs, is
an important quality. The
finest Cereals, combined
with rich cream milk, form
its constituents, and are in
themselves of great diges-
tive value. Therefore,
Invalids, Dyspeptics, and
children can make Horlick’s
their principal food with
impunity, and upon it they
thrive.
Horlick’s requires no elaborate
preparation. It is made in a
moment with the addition of
hot or cold water.
The risk of tainted milk—a risk
often run in hot countries —is
entirely obviated by the use of
Horlick’s, for it is germ-free
and no temperature affects it.
Thus its immense advantages
for travelling and up-country
stations are apparent.
You can try Horlick’s at the
Soda Fountain.

meiit he let a thin stream trickle on the
floor.
“Stop that! Put the kettle down.”
He placed it on a handy chair that also
i- a ea P °I tumbled apparel.
My clean combinations!” she shrieked,
and, seizing the kettle, she poured what
water it contained into the bottom of the
soap dish.
Tommy poked his tongue out at his father,
who shook bis fist at him and called him “a
young dog.”
lie cruelled the old man’s turn,
hustled him into the wings, and claimed the
calcium for himself. He was indeed a
thankless child.
'T>,° leave the boy,” cried Mrs. Wageter.
Pan t you see he’s suffering, all through
your clumsiness.” Thrusting her husband
aside she mopped up the lukewarm liquid
with the corner of a towel and dabbed it at
her son s eye.
‘‘foa’re putting soap in it!” yelled Tommy.
'lt 11 make it better,” she explained, and
applied the suds again. Mr. Wageter
laughed uproariously. Wngotor was
highly indignant.
“If your child’s agony cannot touch you,”
she said with asperity, “at least have the
common decency not to jeer at it.”
I m not jeering. I’m only cheerful to
se p ( alive and kicking.”
“Don’t be ridiculous. It was only a chip
ot crockery that went in his eye, and it’s out
now - I ™ t , itj T pmmy ?” She proceeded to
in narrow bandages.
„ was it?” sneered Mr. Wageter,
that s all you know. Why, he’s been”
“Shut up, dad,” said his son. “I think
llf go to. bed, mummy. It’ll be all right in
the morning.”
“Of course it will! Mummy’s so sorry—
but you ve been a naughtv boy”
“He hasn’t. He’s been in'the”
Dad !”
Fearful localities suggested themselves to
Mrs. \\ ageter, and she glared questioninglv
at her husband and son.
“It’s all right, mum—lemme go to bed.”
un til I’ve heard the rights of this.
Where were you? Where was he?”
“Nowhere,” said Tommy. But he stole his
lather s thunder and added, “only in the hos-
pital.”
“The —the hospital!”
This was father’s last chance, and he
grabbed it with both hands.
“Yes, the hospital,” he explained. “The
chaps at the office gave him a surprise birth-
day dinner and one of them was taken
ill. Of course it’s a serious matter for a
high-class restaurant when a man exhibits
symptoms of ptomaine poisoning at table; so
they bundled them all into a car and ran
them up to the hospital, straight away. The
fellow had a close shave, but they got the
stomach-pump on to him, and injected mor-
phia, and pulled him through. Of course
they kept the whole party under observation
tor a time. In fact, Tommy’s only got home
now.
“Why didn’t you send me word?”
“He didn’t want to frighten us.”
“My dear, brave, thoughtful son.” Mrs.
Wageter flung her arms around him and
kissed him on the unbandaged eye. Mr.
Wageter passed himself innumerable bou-
quets.
‘‘Are you sure you were properly sick?”
“Me? I tell you I wasn’t sick any.”
‘Didn’t they give you anything to make
you ?”
“No, it was the other fellow that was bad.
i m only sleepy.”
Drowsiness is sometimes a pronounced
toxic symptom.” She quoted from a half-
forgotten text-book on first aid. “Tom! the
castor-oil and a spoon, quick! The boy’s
life may depend on it. It’s on the wash-
stand.”
“Wait a bit, dad. Mum, I tell you I was
not sick a bit.”
I erhaps, but I’m not taking any risks.
Kept you in the hospital until this hour.”
I ather handed her the obnoxious blue bottle
and a large spoon. He was quite cheerful.
Ihe bashed nose was forgotten, and heed-
less of Tommy’s protests, he helped his wife
to measure out a liberal dose of the homelv
remedy.
“It’ s Quite tasteless,” she explained.
«S ut 1 don’t need it,” protested her son.
«v OW ’ Tommy, mother knows best.”
Yes,” chorused his father, “mother knows
best.
“I’ll remember this when Hospital Satur-
day comes round! Grudging my dying child
a spoonful of castor-oil! Come now, shut
your eyes and open your mouth. Tommy,
keep your hands down or I’ll make your
father hold your nose.”
“Be a man,” urged Mr. Wageter. “It
won’t hurt you.”
“‘9 f course it won’t hurt him. Do you
think I would harm my own child? Now,
1 r.i’ist one—to please your mother.”
-lo please your mother, Tommy—just
one, and Mr. Wageter’s pantomime was
lucid and expressive.
“It’s all very fine for you, dad! You aren’t
taking the dashed stuff.”
“No, but it wouldn’t hurt him if he did
He hasn’t had any medicine for ever so long!
Just show him, father,” and she directed the
spoon towards her husband.
“Me!” he shouted. “Not much! Don’t
be ridiculous, Mary!”
She backed him into the angle made by the
wardrobe and the wall and it was Tommv’s
turn to be amused.
“Do what I tell you ! Swallow it.”
“Mary!”
“Tom!”
There was that in his wife’s eye that para-
lysed his. negative powers. Like a man in a
trance his mouth opened mechanically.
Mrs. Wageter deftly inserted the spoon and
raked it out empty against his front teeth.
She smiled grimly and Tommy yelled with
delight as his father jumped into bed and
wiped out his mouth on a corner of the
pillow.
“You saw how nicely father took his,”
cooed Mrs. vVageter turning to her son, the
spoon again brimming with the odious decoc-
tion.
~^I £ was h er hour. Tommy was watching
ms father. She was watching her oppor-
tunity. Tommy, spitting oil and profanity,
dashed out of the room.
His mother picked up his boots and threw
them after him.
The dining-room clock solemnly struck
two.
D. H. SOUTER.
The Whale Cure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A STEAMER had come into Eden from
Bermagui, and the passengers on her
decks stared bleakly toward the smoke-
belching whale depot across the bay. A rumor
had been circulated through a dozen news-
papers concerning the curative properties of
w ale oil in cases of chronic rheumatism.
A patient named Bill Cummins had arrived
by the steamer to test the efficacy of the
cure” and was already on the way.
His friends had wheeled him in an in-
vahds chair to the trying-out works under
the hillside. He was past hoping for, they
said but the doctor had suggested, as an
afterthought, that the whale-cure still ex-
isted.
„i/a he “°5 lei ' n . medico does not rashly in-
clude whales in his prescriptions except in
cases where the elusive cetacean ma? be
elied upon to put in an early appearance
to resiffiT e r nt I ° s . t^ n . ce the Patient happened
to reside^ in a district where finbacks and
humpies were fairly abundant during cer-
tain months of the year.
For eight years rheumatism had disabled
and almost deprived Bill Cummins of the
todo 1 ' M, speech a ' l( ] gesture. He was a well-
to-do Monaro cattle breeder, and the local
papers referred to him occasionally as
a P r oof of the lamentable affinity which
exj sts between rheumatism and cows.”
Bill Cummins had never seen a dead whale
uutil they wheeled him into the trying-out
works at East-Boyd, where the last catch, a
bO-tun humpy, lay drawn up on the skid. At
sight of the gas-inflated bulk Bill turned
away his heaA and groaned.
“It’s yer only hope, Bill.” The harpooner
who was m charge of the works approached
the invalid sympathetically. “Ye’ll live in
pain all yer life if yer don’t try the cure,
bick people come from all parts of the world
an not one of ’em has ever objected to the
effluviar.”
The invalid repeated his objections in a
stifled whisper, his face turned from the
dead monster on the skid. Greig, the har-
p.ooner, looked hurt. “Why, the whale’s only
been here two days, Bill,” he said in a tone
of remonstrance. “Wait till he’s stood in
the sun for another 50 hours. Ye won’t
know him then. Whales alter terribly when
they’re left in the sun. Ye’ve never got
to ask a policeman the name an’ address of
°ur whales three days after they’ve been
hoisted out of the water. They speak for
themselves-—poor things.” He slapped the
gas-blown back with a spade and called to
several assistants who were loafing near
the water’s edge.
At a sign from the harpooner Bill Cum-
mins was raised from the chair and placed
very carefully on the grass outside the shed.
Then they stripped him gently until he lay
naked in the warm sunlight.
Taking up a blubber-spade from the
ground Greig advanced to the dead black
whale, and, with the skill of a butcher, dug
a square hole in the back, flinging the
chopped-out blubber across the floor. Paus-
ing a moment to wipe his brow he stared
thoughtfully into the dark hole and then at
the quivering patient.
“If yer feel that yer quite ready, Bill,
we’ll proceed with th’ cure. No use pro-
cransternatin’,” he added persuasively. “Pro-
cransternation is the thief of time, Bill, an’
it don’t improve whales.”
It was not the first time Greig had pre-
pared a whale for the convenience of a visit-
ing patient. It was a business which had
brought out the finer feelings of his nature.
Men came to the works suffering the pangs
of Prometheus, shorn of hope and given over
by the doctors. For a certain sum paid in
advance, he would delay boiling-down opera-
tions to allow some pain-stricken wretch to
wallow in the healing fluid of a newly-caught
cetacean.
Bill Cummins writhed on the sunlit grass,
twisting his toes and hands like one about
to die. At a word from Greig the assistants
raised him tenderly and bore him to the side
of the whale.
“Lift him straight,” shouted Greig.
“Straight I say!”
“Yer can’t straighten ’im,” panted one of
the men. “He’s crooked all over with rheu-
matics.”
Greig scrambled to the whale’s back, and,
as the patient’s feet were raised level with
the hole, caught him by the shoulder quickly
and thrust him down.
A plunging, throttling sound followed. Then
came the belching cough of the healing whale-
fat as it sucked and clung to the body of
Bill.
Greig wiped his brow and smiled content-
edly. The top of Bill’s head only was
visible, and the hair had risen stiff as the
mane of a frightened wolf.
“How d’ye feel, Bill?” Greig lit his pipe
and threw the match into the bay carefully.
"First time y’ever tried a whale-poultice,
eh? Feels good, I bet.”
“Oh!” Bill’s eyes turned skyward as
though seeking relief from the wells of oil
that bubbled under his chin. “Oh!” he re-
peated faintly.
“Drinkin’ rum brings on rheumatics,” said
Greig, thoughtfully. “Rum an’ chasin’cows
over wet ranges. Y’belong to Bega, eh’”
He glanced dismally at the man in tlie
whale.
There was no answer from Bill, only a
spluttering “Ug’rVr!” as the harpooner took
up a ladle and drew away several quarts of
whisky-colored liquor that bubbled and rose
almost to the level of the immovable chin.
“Yer mustn’t drink all the oil, Bill,” he
said, warningly. “A feller came here from
the cow country lars’ year an’ drank up the
whale afore we could stop him. He thought
wed put him into a kind of beer fish. Yer
ain’t got to take the whale internally, Bill.”
The harpooner leaned against the dead
cetacean and watched Bill’s head sorrowfully.
; Te 11 be as right as a filly when we dig
y out, if yer keep from lickin’ the ile when
it rises,” he suggested after a while.
The setting sun began to shine on Bill’s
head, and the harpoon hole near the whale’s
fin whimpered and sang as the oil bubbled
and squeaked over the side. The huge car-
case swelled visibly as the heat rays played
on the dry, slate-colored skin.
A swarm of gulls hovered about the shed,
and one, bolder tha,n the rest, swooped in-
side screaming over the blood : drip under
the giant fluke.
Ug’r’r’r!” Bill’s eyes slanted upward,
•'bin tilted suddenly. Greig again raised
the ladle and removed the uprising oil from
the man’s lips.
( “Ef I wasn’t here,” he said warningly;
yed be drowned, Bill. Ef I was a bloke
what was fond of rum an’ forgot me dooties
an me ladle, ye’d sink an’ sink, Bill, until
the whale fat smothered ye. As things go
ye 11 go back to Bega, an’ yer feller towns-
men 11 read the Riot Act soon as the wind
blows through, yer whiskers.”
“Ug’r’r’r!” Bill made no reply. His
head seemed to roll and tilt above the swift
rising oil. “Ah !” he said hoarsely. “Ah !’■’
The inevitable ladle swooped under his chin
and bore away the rising flood of oil.
“When a man’s been through the whale-
cure,” sighed Greig, “he can owe monev
ail over the district. Yer can’t get a debt
collector to go in his street. Even the price
of propputy is affected when he sleeps in a
empty house.”
The man in the whale writhed, and his
face grew livid. Sweat ran in streams from
his brow. “It’s the rheumatics cornin’ out,
Bill. Ye’ll feel_ like a new-born babe when
it s over.” Greig bent over him consolingly
Try an keep awake. Bill. Yer mustn’t go
ter sleep in the ile.”
The patient’s eyes glazed. The lids drooped
as, one by one, the big blue flies hummed
and circled over the hole in the blubber.
It seemed an hour before the head lifted.
Then he spoke for the first time, and his voice
sounded thin and querulous as a child’s.
“Lift me out,” he said. “Lift me out.”
They were around him in a flash. The
harpooner plunged his hands deep into the
hole and caught him under the arms. The
body came out with a strange gulping sound
as though a huge plug were being drawn
from a water main. They laid the naked,
oil-soaked figure on the grass and massaged
him from head to heel with soft towels.
“I’ve been asleep.” His voice was far
away and indistinct. “It was like being
screwed down in a volcano. I could hear
noises, noises moving all round me like *the
sea on a rough night. .. .Yes, I feel a bit
better.”
His skin had turned to the color of saff-
ron, but the crooked, pain-wracked knee-
joints had become supple and pliable.
“Yer a full brother to the whale now,
Bill,” said Greig gently. “Ye’ll never be
drowned. Ye’ll never be bit by a stingaree
or shark either.”
That night a lamentable odor floated over
Eden. I closed my window softly, for I
knew that the man had come out of the
whale.

Martians.
MONSTROUS are they, the Martian
folk, cumbrous and sullen-eyed ;
Lurking in glades of fungus-growths,
furtive and lone, they bide.
Being a non-gregarious race, they shun each
other, and hide.
Yet Time has fashioned them out a brain,
wise and cunning and old ;
And each has a lair, a secret place, to coil
away from the cold.
And brood, and watch for the passer-by,
secure in his noisome hold.
Akin to the greasy lakes of slime, green is
r their hue, and grey ;
Their cannibal lore admits no waste, and he
that is weak they slay.
And when there falls no fellow for food, on
growths of the ooze they prey.
The lesser, driven to fare on plants that
spore in the foetid mud,
Grow gross and thrive on the evil food, and
heavy with turgid blood;
Till lean ones find them, logged with their
fat, and drag them into the flood.
These batten high on the flap and jowl and
the flabby limbs and feet,
Leaving no morsel of the bulk for wider
mouths to eat;
Then hie away beshirking the jaws that covet
themselves for meat.
They have no family tie nor bond, for all are
sprung from the spore,
And life bears never a hope or hate, and
death is but vaguely sore.
Their only god is the hunger-god; though
years have evolved their lore,
For they know the beginnings and ends of
things, and are wise of their coign in
space;
Their eye has power to read the rays borne
in from the farthest place;
Their ear can detect the ether-swirls as the
planets swing out apace!
They hear the atoms part and impinge when
the crawling mud-waves glide,
And struggling particles disunite as the oily
waters slide;
They hear the chemical warp and woof of
the kelp-weeds floating wide.
Though not the makers of sound themselves
to mar that tremulous air,
They note the thought on the ambient gas
r and the movements everywhere;
To them the clamor of atoms comes in a long,
incessant blare.
So that to each, as he broods by night, know-
ing no form of sleep,
Content if his frame and flaps be fed, while
shadows around him creep,
Come sounds of the writhing fungus-growths
on the night’s vibrations deep.
And when the sun is glaring above through
hazy and humid air,
One lifts the lazy mass of his head, slimy
and grim and bare,
To see if another has furnished food through
death by night in his lair.
Or one slinks into the jungle-brakes, filling
his urging maw,
Crunching the squelching rind and stem with
the wrench of his boneless jaw—
As a vulture tears at a fallen beast cram-
ming his naked craw.
There and about the creeping floods from
the Polar ice-fields run ;
And tides usurp the banks and the swamps
to the driving blasts of the sun;
And mist and murk roll out of the marshes,
sickly, and swirling dun.
Floods recede and the kelp-mass strands,
and there and about appear
Rampant growths of the Martian spring.
Cryptogamous plants uprear
Rioting into monstrous rankness, sweating
and weird and drear.
’Tis then they fatten and spore and perish—
slain, if they do not slay.
Life with hunger its sole economy; a mission
in search of prey.
And death a sudden shutting of discord after
a sordid day.
The cycles move for ever and ever for us
and the worlds akin;
Particles gather and cleave and sunder, end
their mass, and begin;
And light but touches the hem of the dark
where atomy systems spin.
And who shall apply a moral or mean, or
any deduction draw
Concerning the way of life on Mars that
swings to its own grim law?
These, transcending in sense-perception,
merely appease the maw!
