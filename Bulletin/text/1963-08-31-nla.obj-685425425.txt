There’s no more exacting master than Tradition
The Yalumba tradition began with Samuel Smith who, in 1849, founded a vineyard to produce
wines equal to any in the world. A claret born of these concepts is Yalumba Galway Vintage.
Blended from Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz varieties, Galway Vintage is an elegant, yet
delightfully light, claret. Connoisseurs seek it out. Royal Show judges honour its quality. Galway
Vintage Claret, by Yalumba, is indeed worth asking for.

National Notebook
Up Against the Big Boys
ITow would blokes trained in the sprint
conditions of Australian pubs fare
against Herren trained in the marathon
conditions of Biergarten ? This is a ques-
tion still to be resolved in one of the last
sports open to the true amateur: beer-
drinking.
4 But it is a thimble of Cointreau to a
vat of Cooper's that after October the
question will be answered. For Australia
is to be represented at this year's Munich
beer “fest.”
The team which plans to represent
Australia is made up of advertising men
lack Gleeson, aged 28, of Sydney, and
Stan May, aged 23, of Wahroonga, NSW,
assisted by broker’s clerk Rex Beachley,
aged 23, of Manly. Fourth man in the
team is—don’t splutter—an American,
Tim Mclsaac, aged 22, of California, who
has spent two years in Australia.
If “Tim spent most of his time working
for the Snowy Mountains
Authority. We feel he
qualifies as an honorary
Australian,” said Mr May.
He and his companions
are now en route to South-
ampton. From there, they
will make their way to
Munich.
Whatever the outcome of this inter-
national challenge and let’s face it,
it’s more interesting than tennis or cricket
—German etymologists will have a field
day with Australian beer-drinking tech-
nicalities like: pony, middy, schooner and
’hat unfathomable Adelaide measure, the
butcher.
A Real Bottler
HThe conviction and cautioning in the
Perth Police Court recently of
six shopkeepers on charges brought by
two marine dealers in plain language
bottle-os has surprised the soft-drink
trade and caused friction between shop-
keepers and manufacturers. The con-
victions for breaches of the 1902 Marine
Stores Act mean that:
• Only licensed bottle collectors can
collect soft-drink bottles and acceptance
of empties by shopkeepers and the pay-
ment of the traditional deposit is a
thing of the past unless, of course,
the shopkeeper wants to risk a fine or
a maximum of six months’ gaol.
• The only shopkeepers who can ac-
cept empties are those who take out
collectors’ licences but in complying
‘Vith the Act they will have to close
on public holidays and Sundays and
tt 6 p.m. on weekdays and 2 p.m. on
Saturdays.
• Children seeking extra pocket-money
by collecting empties are liable to prose-
cution because they are unlicensed. Be-
ing under 16, they can’t even sell them
to bottle-os, the Court was told.
The Court’s ruling in favor of the
bottle-os involves the annual sale of
nearly 60 million bottles a year in WA.
Soft-drink manufacturers claimed that
the system of bottle deposits through
retailers was world-wide and said the
Court’s decision would make price in-
creases inevitable.
The Aerated Waters Manufacturers’
Association said in a half-page news-
paper advertisement that it would back
the defence of shopkeepers prosecuted
for taking empties. One of its leading
members alleged collusion between the
marine dealers and the Retail Grocers
and Storekeepers’ Association on the
prosecutions, either to end the handling
of empties or to get extra money for it.
Mr Brian Kirby, sec-
retary of the grocers’ as-
sociation, admitted that his
members agreed with the
submission of the marine
dealers’ counsel that
public health was endan-
gered by shopkeepers
handling dirty, smelly bottles which at-
tracted vermin. "One thing nobody has
realised,” he said, “is that manufactur-
ers have been using the public for years
as packhorses for collecting empty bot-
tles. The public are unpaid bottle col-
lectors. This is astonishing and I can
think of no other parallels.”
Though the bottle-os have emerged
triumphant, a newspaper rather un-
kindly pointed out that when the Act
was introduced in 1902 the Premier told
the House that collectors were to be
licensed because some were using their
occupation to spy on houses which they
later burgled.
Rational to a Degree
W. Glanville (“Bill”) Cook, a
" notable Melbourne figure for many
years, has been awarded an honorary
Litt.D. by San Gabriel College, Los
Angeles. Mr Cook recently completed 25
years as editor of “The Rationalist” and
as secretary of the Rationalist Associa-
tion. The degree is in recognition of con-
tributions he has made to Australia’s in-
tellectual life in these capacities.
San Gabriel College, by all accounts,
has a number of teachers who are in-
volved in the American Rationalist
movement. Its vice-president. Dr Lowell
H. Coate, is a former editor of “The
American Rationalist." Dr Coate visited

Australia last year and is now an asso-
ciate editor of Mr Cook’s publication.
Outside of Melbourne’s Rationalist
Movement, Mr Cook is best known for
his radio and television appearances. A
man of Chestertonian proportions, Bill
Cook has a genial and ready wit which
stands him well in ex tempore discus-
sions and verbal exchanges. TV audi-
ences have seen him as the judge in the
“Consider Your Verdict” series and he
is currently on the permanent panel of
the “Information Please” radio session.
The Rationalist Movement has waned
since Bill Cook first became interested
in it as a student in 1928. His conver-
sion, he says, was largely due to Ration-
alist press publications from Britain
available in large numbers in those days.
The famous Coles Book Arcade in
Bourke Street, Melbourne, had an entire
section devoted to Rationalist publica-
tions.
For most of the 25 years he served
as editor and secretary, Bill Cook was
a full-time salaried official of the asso-
ciation. In 1957 a combination of de-
clining income and inflation made it im-
possible for the association to support
a full-time man any longer and Mr Cook
returned to his original profession as a
schoolteacher.
He now hopes to go to America in
December and have his degree con-
ferred, possibly giving some lectures
while he is there. Meanwhile The Bul-
letin thought it would chase up some
particulars of the Californian outpost of
rationalism with the strange name of
San Gabriel. Alas, the American Con-
sulate in Melbourne could not trace it
in its library of reference books. The
best it could turn up was an entry in
the Los Angeles telephone directory for
the “San Gabriel Academy of Seventh
Day Adventists.” So The Bulletin rang
Mr Cook and warned him to make sure
he reported at the right quarters for his
honorary degree.

The Next Step in Saigon
TT must be tempting to many
Americans to throw up their
hands over South Vietnam, dismiss-
ing both the Diem regime and its
Buddhist enemies as behaving like
madmen in the face of a Commun-
ist threat that is equally grave for
both of them. If Americans were
looking for justification to adopt
the recommendations of the Mans-
field Report to the US Senate in
December, 1962, cut their losses
and get out of South Vietnam, this
horrible civil war provides one.
Before we give in to any such
pessimism, however, it is worth re-
calling how far from victory the
Communists are in South Vietnam.
In fact, unlike their comrades in
North Vietnam, they have never had
any real hope of complete victory
because they do not have, and can-
not have, the sort of conventional
mass army necessary to conquer
South Vietnam or occupy the main
cities. They lack such an army
because they have no supply lines
capable of maintaining one. They
are guerrillas only and, as Sir
Gerald Templar showed in Malaya,
guerrillas never win unless the more
powerful enemy army becomes de-
moralised and throws in its hand.
But the Diem army and the
Americans have shown no inten-
tion of either throwing in their hand
or of allowing the Vietcong to build
itself into an openly organised large-
scale army by importing massive
supplies from Red China either
directly or through Laos.
It is this, rather than the system
of strategic hamlets, which is the
key to the situation. The strategic
hamlets protect the civilians, they
do not destroy guerrillas. It was
different in Malaya because there
a large part of the rural population
was relocated in order to starve out
the guerrillas, the police and
counter-intelligence were more effi-
cient than in South Vietnam, and
the Communists were racially differ-
ent from the Malays. The
strategic hamlets are important, but
even without them the Communists
cannot win—short of a complete
.conflagration in South Asia.
It does not follow, of course,
that the Vietcong guerrillas will be
stamped out easily. This would
remain true even in comparatively
ideal conditions such as existed in
Malaya. But conditions are far
from ideal, and the Communists’
best ally had been the inefficiency
of the Diem regime, of which the
handling of the Buddhist crisis has
been the worst example.
It would seem clear now that the
Americans must use their power to
change the Government of South
Vietnam. To date, most observers
have claimed that there is no pos-
sible alternative to the present Gov-
ernment. But the point has been
reached where the Government is
actually doing more harm than good.
Perhaps the best guide here is India
where, after a grave national crisis,
Mr Nehru remains the ruler but
his Government has been reshuffled
and revitalised. What South Viet-
nam needs—if it is not absolutely
too late—is President Diem with-
out his present Cabinet and particu-
larly without the infamous Madame
Nhu. Australia has officially ex-
pressed “extreme repugnance” at
developments in Saigon. The next
step is to help remove these causes:
we have too much at stake to re-
main silent.
The Party Which Always Says No
TTIE articles on pages 6 and 7
A of this issue draw attention to
the increasing divisions between the
Liberal and Country Parties, par-
ticularly over redistribution and
certain Federal seats in Victoria
(though the same conflicts exist on
a smaller scale on a State level).
The possibility of a 1940-type dis-
solution of the Liberal-Country
Government must be constantly in
Mr Calwell’s mind, especially in
view of the apathy in Liberal circles
about this situation.
This apathy, however, is part of
a larger situation which could be
even more damaging to the Govern-
ment than a split the apathy over
policy. There is some truth (or what
amounts to the same thing as far
as the voters are concerned, the ap-
pearance of truth) in the claim that
the Liberals’ policy as shown, for
example, in the Budget is no more
than a mixture of ideas borrowed
from the Country and Labor
parties.
On a wide variety of other is-
sues, of varying degrees of import-
ance or popularity, ranging from
proposals for a US-style Federal
Housing Authority to help insurance
companies finance home purchases,
proposals for a Northern Develop-
ment Authority, proposals for con-
stitutional reform or economic
planning, the Liberals’ regular
comment nowadays seems to be:
No! Indeed, the Liberals’ image is
increasingly that of the Party which
always says No.
A party with a great majority
in Parliament may be able to get
away with this, but a party with
a tiny majority cannot.
Change of Tune
TINE of the more enjoyable ironies
of the situation arising from
Djakarta’s implacable hostility to
Malaysia is the sudden British dis-
covery that Indonesia is a threat
to world peace.
This new, shrill tone of alarm
contrasts very sharply with Bri-
tain’s attitude to Indonesia over
Netherlands New Guinea two years
ago.
In those days Indonesian aggres-
sion against the Dutch and West
New Guinea drew no censure in
the British Press.
In fact the then British Ambas-
sador in Djakarta, Sir Lesley Fry,
said on more than one occasion
that Indonesia had been robbed of
West New Guinea by the Dutch
and had every moral justification
in seeking its return and incorpora-
tion in the Republic.

LIBERALS v. COUNTRY PARTY—I
Calwell Scents
Victory
Remember 1940
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
J. McEWEN
Not bluffing
Arthur Calwell had good reason to
look happier last week than he had
for a long time. Calwell knows his
history, and this knowledge made him
feel close to the Prime Ministership that
eluded him by only two House of Re-
presentatives seats and a handful of
votes at the 1961 elections.
Sir Robert Menzies and Deputy Prime
Minister John McEwen are not the only
ones in Parliament who lived through
the 1940/41 period which saw division
between the Liberal and Country Parties
open the gateway to eight years of Labor
rule. Calwell entered Parliament in
the 1940 elections and lived through the
same era. He now senses an atmosphere
of crisis not yet as intense but un-
mistakably similar to that which led
to the open clash between the then
Government parties and the wartime
entrenchment of a Federal Labor Gov-
ernment.
As Calwell is well aware, the time
when an Opposition ceases to be an Op-
position and gets the opportunity to be-
come a Government is when the Govern-
ment divides internally. The defects of the
Opposition (if they are not too obviously
glaring) then tend to be overlooked. It
is the Government’s faults, real or ima-
ginary, upon which the voters seize and
against which they register their protest.
As I see it, the Government could not
be handling things better from Mr Cal-
well’s viewpoint. It is almost as though
it is engaged in furthering his political
interests. There is an air of lethargy.
Very influential members of the Govern-
ment make no secret of their worry about
the quite significant deterioration in
Liberal-Country Party relationships, and
nobody seems to be doing anything about
it. There is an atmosphere of drift, of
Micawber-like hoping that something
will turn up or that time will somehow
of its own volition provide the solution.
The basis of the Government’s com-
placency appears to be the belief held
by some senior Ministers that McEwen
is bluffing, that he will back down on his
demands for rural interests to be re-
cognised in any electoral redistribution
and that Liberals should declare a tem-
porary truce with their CP partners in
CP-held Federal seats for the next elec-
tions.
McEwen may be bluffing, but I do not
think he is. He seems to have moved
past the point when it was possible he
could have led, as Prime Minister and
successor to Sir Robert Menzies, a joint
Liberal-Country Party administration.
At 63 he cannot be too far from
retirement and must have an eye on
what the history books may say about
him. What at this particular stage in
his career is more important to Mc-
Ewen? To try to preserve the Menzies
coalition Government? Or try and pre-
serve the rural representation which he
identifies with the Country Party and
which the Liberals want him to sacrifice
in the overall interests of the Menzies
coalition?
The answers to those questions are any-
one’s guess, but the consequences for
the Liberals could be disastrous if they
guess wrongly when they say that Mc-
Ewen is bluffing. For if the Liberals and
CP go to the next elections openly in
conflict, the Menzies Government, with
its bare Parliamentary majority, would
have to count upon yet another cala-
mitous blunder by the Labor Party to
be returned to power. But while Labor
has shown an extraordinary capacity
over recent years for making blunders,
the Menzies Administration cannot ex-
pect it to go on making self-destructive
blunders indefinitely.
Calwell’s Budget speech last week re-
flected his appreciation of this situa-
tion. Many Liberals were inclined to be
contemptuous of it, because it barely
touched on the Budget. But it was a
very clever political speech. Calwell in
effect said that the good things in the
Budget were all filched from Labor, and
then proceeded to ignore the Budget. He
went on to touch on the sensitive na-
tional spots —to depict the kind of Aus-
tralia he would like to see.
A lot of his stuff was “pie in the
sky,” the sort of stuff that even if it
could be achieved could not be achieved
THE HOLY POLICE
80 Years Ago: September 1, 1883
HThe tyranny of Sabbatarianism be-
comes every day more obvious. A
Mr Styles, in order to catch the
Hobart boat at Eden (NSW), was
obliged to drive his cattle through
pious Panbula on the Sabbath, or, as
he explained, leave the poor animals
starving for two days in the shipping
yards. But inhumanity and cruelty is
the very life of Sabbatarianism, and
so the holy police of Panbula laid an
information against Mr Styles for Sab-
bath-breaking under a statute of the
days of Charles 11. The Panbula bench
dismissed the case. Perhaps it would
be as well if they could do the same
kind service to their pious subordin-
ates.
A theatrical entrepreneur sent a
letter to a Wesleyan clergyman
soliciting patronage for a “moral”
play he was about to put on, and re-
ceived the following reply:— “Will
you kindly allow me to return the
compliment by inviting you and the
members of your company to the ser-
vices to be conducted in the Wesleyan
Church on Sunday next, at 11 a.m.
and 7 p.m. The stewards will be glad
to find you free sittings, and you
will not be under any 'Obligation to
contribute to the voluntary offertory.
The subject of the morning will be
‘The true life and moral discipline,’
and that of the evening ‘The one thing
needful’ the other portions of the
services, including music, as usual. I
would especially remind you that this
may be the last opportunity you will
have of accepting such an invitation,
for the end of all things is at hand.”

by one Budget, but it was exciting “pie
in the sky” of the sort that is always
hopefully at the back of the national
imagination. A giant three-Government

lines of the Snowy Mountains Authority;
a defence vote back to the 4.3 per cent
of the gross national product instead of
the present 2.7 per cent (“Is the threat of

years ago?”); a US - type Housing

5.5 per cent annual growth rate which
the Reserve Bank Governor, Dr H. C.
Coombs, said last June was possible
without serious inflation in place of the
cautious Treasury-controlled annual 2
per cent growth of the past decade,
It may not be economically practical
but it ims politically practical. It was
visionary, and Calwell is shrewd enough
to know when there is a possibility of a
Government disintegrating. It is better
for an Opposition to be visionary than
dully cautious.
LIBERALS v. COUNTRY PARTY-II
Liberals Move Into
McEwen Country
The battle of Indi
FROM MIKE MOONIE IN WANGARATTA
R. M. HOLTEN
Canny
Tn solidly respectable Reid Street, Wan-
garatta, one shop-front sign says:
“Mac Holten, Licensed Grocer.” One
hundred yards away, an illuminated sign
proclaims: “Foyster, Chemist”. This
brief stretch of bitumen twanged with
tension last week as the two proprietors
emerged as rivals for the Indi seat
in the House of Representatives, and the
Country Party Leader, John McEwen,
voiced his indignation at the Liberal
Party’s announcement that it had en-
dorsed candidates for the CP seats of
Indi and Wimmera.
The alter ego of Mac Holten, licensed
grocer, is Rendle McNeilage Holten,
Country Party Member for the electorate
of Indi which sprawls across north-
eastern Victoria from the headwaters
stream of the Murray River which pro-
vides its name to within 40 miles of
Melbourne. “Foyster, Chemist” is lan
Menzies Foyster, endorsed by the Lib-
eral Party to carry its banner in the next
Federal election.
Holten had won the seat from the
then Liberal member, Air-Vice-Marshal
W. D. Bostock in 1958, largely because he
was the better known man. Bostock had
made no secret of his view that a Fede-
ral politician’s job was to form and in-
fluence national policy, not to scamper
about his electorate extending the glad
hand. On the other hand, Holten had
played 80 games with the Victorian Foot-
ball League side Collingwood, and gone
to Wangaratta in 1949 to coach one of
the local football teams. A shrewd foot-
baller, canny tactician and an undoubt-
ed leader, he did it so successfully that
his side won four premierships in sue-
cession and he was the automatic choice
to coach combined teams in inter-league
matches. Even more remarkably in a
league marked by fervid partisanship, he
went into retirement in 1956 with friends
in every club.
Busy in sport and in building up a
business, Holten had shown little evi-
dence of active interest in public life,
but the Country Party, badly needing
talent if it were to make a serious at-
tempt to unseat Bostock, saw him as
a possible candidate and made him sec-
retary of its local branch. At the time,
Holten appeared to have few qualifica-
tions apart from youth, energy, some
ambition, native shrewdness, and a well-
known name.
He became president of Wangaratta
Chamber of Commerce and revitalised
it; was chairman of a successful anti-
cancer appeal; stumped the electorate
and shook 3000 hands. In the 1958 elec-
tion his speeches were reminiscent of
half-time pep talks to the football team.
He defeated Bostock on the primary
count by 98 votes and, on preferences,
went on to win by 5230. The Country
Party, having gained a blanket cover-
age of Federal and State seats in north-
eastern Victoria, was jubilant.
Holten quickly demonstrated that so
far as his own seat was concerned he
intended this state of affairs to become
permanent. He installed a manager in
his business and became a full-time poli-
tician. In the tradition of his party, he
cultivated the electors assiduously. He
passed up chances of parliamentary tours
in favor of staying home to attend to his
mail. He made “meet the people” tours
regularly, went to agricultural shows,
dinners, balls and sporting events. He be-
came a familiar figure in editors’ offi-
ces and reporters’ rooms, took particular
care to bone up on rural problems, and
wore a track to Federal Ministers’ offi-
ces with his constituents’ problems. His
utterances, if not scintillating, became
more thoughtful, fluent and coherent.
He stepped carefully perhaps over-
cautiously in avoiding the electors’
toes.
When a landslide almost threw the
Government out in 1961, Holten in-
creased his primary vote by nearly 50
per cent, mainly at the expense of the
Liberals. Last week, at 41, he was brim-
ming over with confidence after a week
which had brought a superphosphate
bounty in the Budget, and emergency
tariff protection for his electorate’s lar-
gest industry, the Bruck rayon mills in
Wangaratta. The appearance on the poli-
tical scene of lan Menzies Foyster was


the only shadow but a shadow hinting
at some substance.
Where Holten is rangy, drawling and
faintly weatherbeaten, the Liberals’ can-
didate lan Menzies Foyster is slight,
dapper and precise, a professional man
and businessman to his fingertips. He
claims no direct kinship with Prime
Minister Menzies although, by coinci-
dence, they attended the same college
in Ballarat. Aged 30, Foyster bought a
Wangaratta pharmacy five years ago. He
came into prominence in organising
Wangaratta’s wool festival which was
narrowly beaten for the Wool Bureau
national wool promotion award last
year, and won the Wool Board crown
hands down this year with an irresistible
combination of an official opening by
Sir Robert Menzies and a picturesque
re-enactment of Major Mitchell’s bul-
lock wagon journey, which hit the front
pages and was noted through the report-
age of “Batman” in the columns of
The Bulletin. Ironically, the Prime
Minister’s visit was secured on the rep-
resentations of the Member for Indi,
Mac Holten.
Even without a bullock wagon, Foy-
ster is likely to make his political cam-
paign lively. He will woo the voters
with vigor and a fair measure of charm.
His handicaps in a largely rural elector-
ate will be his obvious businessman’s
aura, his youth Holten was six years
older when he took the seat and the
considerable start which the CP member
has in knowledge of the electorate and
in political know-how.
But Foyster’s appearance has un-
doubtedly given the Liberals the most
likely candidate they have had in Indi
for years, and some prospect of winning
back the 4500 votes lost in 1961. The
odds at the moment could probably be
fairly quoted at 6/4 in Holten’s favor,
but the battle of Reid Street has barely
begun.

carve-up in the next Act is already on.
Opperman already had a taste of the
coming scramble for funds when the
Lord Mayors of the capital cities called
on him a few months ago to press their
claims for more money for city roads.
Since then Melbourne’s outgoing Lord
Mayor, Sir Maurice Nathan, has kept
on saying ad nauseum that the city’s
available road finance is only chicken
feed compared with the needs and, quite
apart from the expensive schemes for
more freeways, the motorists, pedestrians
and hospital casualty wards all agree
with him.
But as the member for Mallee, where
the roads are long, dry and mostly un-
sealed, pointed out in the Representatives,
if the cities get more the country will get
less. He said that if the cities’ claims for
at least 40 per cent of available Federal
road funds were met and as 40 p.c. was
committed to rural roads other than
highways (actually rural roads are cur-
rently getting more than 40 per cent),
this would leave a wholly inadequate
share of 20 per cent or less for main
roads and highways.
With everybody trying to take as much
as they can out of the pint-sized pot of
road finance and nobody being even
remotely satisfied at the result, efforts
are being bent to increase the size of
the pot.
It is not that the kitty has not been
greatly increased in recent years but
rather that it has not been increased
enough.
Whereas in 1949-50 road grants to
the States amounted to less than £9m.
and in the four years 1959-60 to 1962-63,
under current legislation a total of
£l92m. had been provided, Common-
wealth finance for roads is to rise by
£4 million to £5B million this financial
year. The £sBm. will not include special
grants for beef roads in Queensland, the
Northern Territory and Western Aus-
tralia.
One body which seems to have its
sights right on this issue is the Australian
Roads Federation. It says that the chorus
of pressure to put up the petrol tax is
based on a false premise and that the
whole campaign for better roads should
be re-orientated.
It thinks that current contributions to
the campaign ignore the basic fact that
the Commonwealth has no constitutional
power or responsibility in the field of
road development, finance and manage-
ment being divorced. It points out that
petroleum taxation is not a Federal road
finance levy but a Commonwealth
revenue tax similar to the tariff on tex-
tiles and the excise duty on tobacco.
It also says an increase in the Federal
petrol tax would further inflate trans-
port costs and, in any case, it thinks
Federal road finance as a Budget item
has almost reached saturation point. It
claims that with so much on its plate
in the way of development “it is unreal-
istic to imagine that a. spectacular in-
crease in road finance will be forth-
coming from Federal Revenue.”
Be that as it may, there is a lot of
sense in the Federation’s idea that more
of the burden of road finance should
be placed on borrowing and that “be-
fore we can reach this source of large-
scale road finance there would need to
be a prospectus under the imprimatur
of the Commonwealth in the form of a
specific plan of arterial roads of overall
national value.”
To put these ideas into practice the
Federation wants to see the establish-
ment of a Commonwealth Roads Au-
thority and a Federal Highway Com-
mission.

The End Of
Bon Marche
After 86 years, the Receiver
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
THhe Reid Murray debacle continues to
A make gashes in the central Mel-
bourne landscape. Last week the pre-
mises of the old Collins Street “carriage
trade” firm, Hicks Atkinson, went up for
auction, just as another retailing land-
mark, Payne’s Bon Marche of Bourke
Street, closed its doors. Both had been
Reid Murray subsidiaries.
The Hicks building at 340 Collins
Street was bought for £430,000 by the
AMP Society which will replace the
building with a multi-storey office block.
The .AMP does not intend to use the
new building itself, but will lease it out
as office suites. The other two Hicks
lots, facing Bourke Street, were not sold.

The bigger one, covering an acre and
with access to Little Collins Street, had
a reserve of £1,850,000 but the auc-
tioneer could not even raise a bid of
£750,000. The third lot, comprising
Hicks Arcade and the Metropole Build-
ing, was passed in at £125,000, reserve
being £170,000.
About twenty-four hours earlier the
end of the 86-year-old Payne’s Bon
Marche had been dramatically signalled
by the bankruptcy receiver. In mid-
afternoon staff and customers were told
over the loud-speaker system that the
store would close at 5.30 p.m. that day.
The decision followed the negotiation of
the sale of the firm’s entire stocks to the
Myer Emporium. As well as the Bourke
Street establishment, Payne’s branches in
Geelong, Albury and other centres also
closed.
Hicks had been in the “quality” trade
for over a century, but Payne’s had dedi-
cated itself to bargain lines ever since it
was founded by Englishman John Payne
last century. Until Reid Murray took
it over in 1955, it had dealt entirely in
men's and women’s clothing and other
softgoods. The Reid Murray group
jazzed it up by introducing hire purchase,
furniture and domestic appliances.
In 1917 the business had been acquired
by Mr W. J. Wearne and under his con-
trol it had undergone considerable ex-
pansion, becoming one of the features
of the eastern end of Bourke Street,
much patronised by working-class fami-
lies from Fitzroy, Collingwood and Carl-
ton. The premises were swept by fire
in 1929, but from all accounts Mr
VVearne was able to turn this to advant-
age with a good old-style fire sale.
Mr Wearne died in 1954 and under
the deal with the Reid Murray group of a
year later the business was sold on a
“walk-in-walk-out” basis. The new-
comers took a 20-year lease on the pre-
mises, the freehold remaining in the
hands of an investment trust which Mr
VVearne had set up for his two daughters
and their children.
The lease still has over ten years to
run. In the hands of the receiver, it is
an asset, but at this stage it is not known
what plans he may have for realising on
it. There is no question, however, of
the freehold property being sold as part
of the Reid Murray wind-up.
Over 200 people were out of work as
a result of the close-down and the Shop
Assistants’ Union protested about the
short notice given to them. However,
most of the sales staff had seen the writ-
ing on the wall long before they heard
it over the loudspeakers. An executive
of the firm said that although Paynes
and Hicks have bowed out, Melbourne
retailing is doing well and there is a good
employment position for experienced
sales people.


LAW
The Man
In The Ice-Box
“On the beach ”
FORM JAMIESON BROWN IN PERTH
J. J. DRINAN
“Incompetence”?
A Court of Marine Enquiry, assisted
by two master mariners, recently
found Queenslander John James Drinan
guilty of incompetence in losing the 52ft.
prawn trawler NOR 6, which sank on
the West Australian coast last April.
(Three crewmen died in the tragedy.)
Drinan, a national hero a few months
ago when rescued after a 17-day ordeal
at sea on an 8' x 7' icebox, has been de-
prived of his skipper’s “ticket” and is
now technically “on the beach” for
twelve months.
The Court’s decision must perturb
the many skippers of small fishing craft
who operate their boats amongst the
reefs and shoals around our shores. Few
of these men have a firm grounding
in navigation and most of them navigate
the same way as did Drinan—by com-
pass, echo sounder, rough shore bearings,
local knowledge, and a visual lookout.
When the skipper has to sleep the boats
are frequently left in charge of a deck-
hand with virtually no knowledge of
navigation. Yet Drinan—who passed for
his skipper’s ticket after a week’s tuition
in navigation and signals—was put on
trial as if he were a gold-braided captain
of a giant liner with a staff of fully
qualified officers to relieve him on the
bridge. (Drinan was off watch and asleep
when NOR 6 foundered.)
The question arises as to whether
fishermen who lose their boats with loss
of life, should be tried by master marin-
ers who, in most instances, would have
no experience of the conditions under
which fishermen operate. If the fisher-
men are to be so tried, then the question
also arises whether the authorities who
issued them with their tickets ought to
ensure that they are as competent navi-
gators as their possible judges, and that
their boats are provided with the navi-
gational instruments that a master
mariner would have at his disposal. And
if the matter is to be continued through
to a sound conclusion then all fishing
boats ought to carry enough qualified
hands on board to take charge of the
other watches when the skipper is asleep.
This, of course, is both impractical and
ridiculous. But no more ridiculous than
the present set-up where fishermen can
qualify for their skipper’s ticket after
passing a trifling examination then sud-
denly be expected to have the know-
ledge and competency of a fully-blown
master mariner when they have the mis-
fortune to lose their boats.
Another amazing aspect of the Drinan
case is the magistrate’s reported state-
ment that Drinan took no bearings be-
tween Shoal Point light and the posi-
tion where the boat foundered 110 miles
further north, even though “there were
many prominent landmarks from which
bearings could have been taken to de-
termine the boat’s exact position.” “The
Australian Pilot”, in describing the same
stretch of coast, says: “the land is so
level and the coast so uniform that it
presents no summits or points by which
any particular part of the coast might
be identified.”
In any case the last ten hours of the
boat’s journey was sailed in darkness
along an unlighted coast. How could
anyone—even a master mariner—take a
bearing?
It would appear as if Jack Drinan has
been made to “take the can back” in
an effort to soothe the public concern
at the alarming number of fishing boats
that have been wrecked along the West
Australian coast.
QUEEN’S TOUR
Macmillan’s Gift
£250,000
FROM A CANBERRA CORRESPONDENT
A few months ago when Queen Eliza-
beth was in Canberra for the Jubilee
of the naming of the city, the British
Government, through Prime Minister
Macmillan, offered “a very substantial
sum” to Canberra to mark the occasion
to be spent, at Australia’s choice, on
something that would commemorate the
link between the Parliaments of the two
countries. Mr Macmillan apparently had
in mind something like a series of foun-
tains in front of the eventual permanent
Parliament House (not yet on the draw-
ing boards) or a carillon tower.
The authoritative word has now gone
round Canberra that Mr Macmillan’s
“very substantial sum” is £250,000. At
its last meeting the A.C.T. Advisory
Council recommended the Government
to “use the British Government’s gift
of <£250,000 to build a cultural centre
for the national capital.” Professor H. W.
Arndt, who moved the motion, stressed
that Canberra cultural clubs and societies
lacked a home, and its theatrical groups
lacked a theatre.
The British Government, however, may
take the view that the links it wishes
to make more lasting in Canberra are
those of British interest . . .
EDUCATION
Salesman’s Life?
The " Britaiuiica ” case
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
A former ‘‘Encyclopaedia Britannica”
salesman who is suing for alleged
holiday pay of £9l 19s. has resulted in
the public getting some alleged behind-
the-scenes glimpses of the door-to-door
encyclopaedia business. In the Melbourne
District Court, Mr Laurence Gilham is
claiming the sum as representing one-
twenty-fifth of the £2,299 which he said
he earned between May 31, 1961, and
January 16, 1962, while selling Britanni-
cas. The company, however, claims
that Gilham was not an employee, but an
agent. The company is also claiming
that even if holiday pay is granted to
Gilham, he owes it £123 11s., represent-
ing commission paid him on sales subse-
quently cancelled.
A witness, Sidney Douglas Russell,
told the Court he worked for Britannica
from July, 1961, until the end of
1962. He said that salesmen started
the day at 9.05 by making phone calls
to prospective buyers and had to make
a quota of five appointments for the
evening. “When making a telephone
call we had to follow a script called
a telephone talk which Mr Groom
(the Victorian manager) told us had to
be followed word for word.” Another
script was supplied which had to be fol-
lowed during the evening visits to poten-
tial buyers. He said he had been told
to follow this word for word, too, and
to use certain word inflexions.
After a morning of making appoint-
ments, the afternoon was a rest period.
Another typed script advised how to use
this period. It suggested taking a shower
and eating a steak with a glass of wine.
Gilham told the Court this was “possibly

LABOR
Union Revolt
Court-controlled ballot?
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
Tt is now possible that one of Queens-
A land’s top Communists, Mr Gerry
Dawson, will be toppled from his union
throne. He has been State secretary of
the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters
and Joiners for more than 20 years. The
Queensland branch has 10,000 members.
He is a member of the State’s Trades
and Labor Council and is its basic wage
advocate in the State Industrial Court.
Recently a group of members has
been organising to “try to rid the branch
of Communist influences and pressures”.
The principal Registrar of the Federal
Arbitration Court (Mr A. E. O'Brien)
has accepted a petition signed by more
than 500 members seeking an independ-
ently conducted branch election of offi-
cials. The ballot is due in November.
Leader of the organisers of the attempted
revolution is a Queensland Housing Com-
mission carpenter (Mr L. R. Evans), who
is spokesman for a rank-and-file com-
mittee. It will be the society's first
court-controlled ballot for officials.
Mr Evans’ main complaints are that
although not all State officials are Com-
munists, they find little difficulty in
associating with Communists in “unity
tickets” when seeking election, and that
union funds had been made available
for donations to front organisations for
the Communist Party. He also claimed
that every decent rank and filer who
dared to express opposition to Commun-
ism was intimidated, abused, and
hounded.
Mr Dawson, however, may still sur-
vive the assault on his citadel. In June,
last year, for example, Mr F. B. Thomp-
son, a member of the North Queensland
Communist Party, retained his position
as head of the Amalgamated Engineering
Union’s Division 1, which extends from
Mackay north, and west to Mt Isa. He
won a court-controlled ballot for secre-
taryship of the division by an absolute
majority over two opponents.

OUT AND ABOUT
When the Asp Bit the Fox
Zanuck’s " Cleopatra ” much ado about very little
By ROY PERROTT
Last May, about a month before the
New York premiere of “Cleo-
patra,” a stocky figure emerged
from the projection room at the Twen-
tieth Century-Fox studio lot in Holly-
wood and paced reflectively, shoulders
hunched, to his office across the way.
The director of “Cleopatra,” Joseph
L. Mankiewicz, had been watching the
final studio-screening of his epic, cut
and edited out of the 120 miles of film
he had shot in one country or another.
“Cleopatra" had changed the director,
the actors, the script-writers, and fre-
quently the scene of the struggle. She
had extracted $4O million (£l4 million)
from Fox, a sum approaching half the
net capital value of the company, mak-
ing the movie much the most costly ever
filmed. She agitated Wall Street, caused
a showdown between bankers and film-
men. disrupted the board, changed the
management. By the end, she had
brought one of the world’s biggest
motion-picture companies to its knees.
The man who had the misfortune to
preside over this decline was Spyros K.
Skouras, president and chief executive.
He is a large man dominating
head on imposing shoulders; his official
photographs do not underplay the im-
perial Roman look. The Caesar of the
Cleopatra adventure is recognisab'e at
a glance. His personality stamped itself
on the whole affair as much as anyone’s.
Tough, shrewd, stubborn and guarded;
but also, at intervals, impetuous and
fond of spur-of-the-moment decisions.
The idea of a “Cleopatra” film was
put to the company by Walter Wanger
(pronounced “Waynjer”), an indepen-
dent producer, late in 1958. It was char-
acteristic of Fox’s attitude then that it
half-heartedly thought of this as a low-
budget picture, costing a million or less.
Fox executives were not men afflicted
with squandermania far from it. They
were bargain-hunters; they wanted to
make sure of earning more by spending
less.
For a million dollars, since even non-
spectacular films were costing twice as
much, Fox would scarcely have been
able to afford more than a handful of
extras. Huge armies might have been
mentioned in the script. But on this
budget they could hardly have been
shown to the audience in more than
platoon strength.
By the spring of 1959 Fox was ready
to go to about $3 million, having priced
up the cost of a screen-play commis-
sioned from Nigel Balchin. The studio
wanted Joan Collins to play the lead:
she was under contract and would have
been relatively cheap. There were con-
flicting versions of how Elizabeth Taylor
was signed up instead. One, quite well
supported, says that she was in her bath
when Wanger rang up to offer the part
and, since the call was untimely, said she
would do it for a million dollars as an
inverted way of saying no. After nego-
tiations she settled for $750,000
(£.270,000) or, if it was more, 10 per
cent of the gross plus $3OOO a week
expenses.
Miss Taylor’s contract necessitated a
European location, so that her Swiss
company could claim tax relief on her
salary. The Fox men chose Italy, but
after Rouben Mamoulian, who had been
engaged to direct, had spent some weeks
there signing up studios they fell out
with some Italian associates and decided
to do it in Hollywood. Then they de-
cided to divide it between Rome and
London. Then they determined to shoot
it all in London. The advantage of Eng-
land was that, under a Government sup-
port scheme, they would get tax benefits
on the English sales of the film.
So London it was; and by August,
1960, a mammoth Alexandria was rising
on eight and a half acres at Pinewood,
the set-builders being hurried along at
overtime rates.
Towards the end of September, they
were able to begin shooting. Then the
weather broke. For weeks on end Alex-
andria stood veiled in mist, rain, or
fog, with heavy mud underfoot. Up to
a thousand extras and several hundred
horses were frequently on call to make
the best of any sunshine. Caesar and
Antony acted a few scenes, but in many
of the rushes their breath showed steamy
in the cold air. Miss Taylor was feverish
and unable to take part.
By mid-November, with only 12 min-
utes of usable film made, Fox suspended
production and began a long wrangle
with the consortium of 70 Lloyd’s under-
writers who had insured the production
against loss (Fox eventually got just over
$2 million back).
Skouras’ dilemma was a real one:
the costs of the film and side expenses
had now passed $5,500,000 and there
was little to show for it. The star was
convalescing, her health still uncertain.
About a million dollars’ worth of capital
was sunk in studio sets; the rental was
mounting.
Fox was already out of its customary
depth. But Skouras said they would try
again in England and insisted “No Liz,
no Cleo.” He was not being sentimental.
They had now invested so much that
only a star with undoubted box-office
pull could ensure a rescue. But in Janu-
ary Mamoulian resigned, tired of the
script (which had been worked over by
many hands), the weather and the policy.
Skouras needed a new director. A new
phase had begun.
While Fox had been undergoing the
Pinewood ordeal. Joseph Mankiewicz
had been sitting in the sun in Florida,
writing a film script out of Lawrence
Durrell’s “Alexandria Quartet.” In Feb-
ruary, Skouras invited him to dinner in
New York and asked him. purely as

an “emergency operation,” to spare be-
tween 10 and 15 weeks to finish “Cleo-
patra.” Skouras showed every sign of
being a desperate man, and the terms
offered were a measure of it.
By early March, 1961, Twentieth
Century-Fox was poised for a fresh as-
sault on “Cleopatra.”
But calamity struck again. The star,
Elizabeth Taylor, fell ill with pneumonia
and for several days her life hung in the
balance. By the time she recovered and
went off to California for several months’
convalescence, the situation was drastic-
ally changed. England and the big in-
vestment in sets there would have to
be written off they could not risk the
weather again. Overhead expenses would
go on rising and the production would
have to be that much quicker and greater
to be sure of getting the money back.
And so, while the workmen at Pine-
wood demolished the eight-acre Alex-
andria they had built at giddy speed and
overtime rates only seven months be-
fore, the Fox production team flew to
Hollywood to make another start. They
planned to shoot all interior scenes there,
then move to Italy and Egypt for out-
side location shots in the autumn.
By June, 1961, they had built six
major sets, and down the road towards
Los Angeles, on a lot once galloped over
by Tom Mix, they excavated a large
lake on which the naval battles could be
shot in miniature.
Another Change of Mind
cement was hardly dry when new
■*" orders came from New York: the
whole film was now to be shot in Italy
and Egypt. The proud stoics of the scen-
ery department again set about a demoli-
tion job. The lake, which had cost
$350,000 (£125,000), was never used; a
fast-moving real estate company had it
under a property development before the
film was finished.
Several reasons were given for the
abrupt change of mind. The Hollywood
stages were needed to accommodate
“The Greatest Story Ever Told” (a life
of Christ, which some advisers thought
might gross more speedily Biblicals
were on the way up). A Mediterranean
location would not only be more authen-
tic, the point that the director insisted
upon, but also cheaper.
Hollywood would be too costly see-
ing that extras there now commanded
$3O (£10) a day, and $lOO a day if
they spoke a line, against the $lO fee
current in Italy. Miss Taylor's agent was
going to demand more money if she was
going to sacrifice her European tax bene-
fits by filming in Hollywood.
In the event, none of these reasons
really stood the test of time. The Bib-
lical epic was before long indefinitely
postponed when they became too dan-
gerously immersed with Egypt to cope
with anything else; the difference be-
tween Rome and Hollywood costs soon
became academic.
So, in a mood of mounting urgency,
the film-makers set off for Rome. Be-
cause of the pressing need to get the
picture finished and earning, Mankiewicz
was given a September deadline to start
shooting. This left four months to get
ready from scratch, or a quarter of the
time which any company in a relaxed
state of mind would have thought proper
for a production of this size.
They hired all available space at the
big Cinecitta studios near Rome. A thou-
sand workmen were taken on for set-
building. A hundred Hollywood tech-
nicians were flown out to help and super-
vise all, of course, on expense ac-
counts. The Fox art department was
busy converting its hundreds of set de-
signs and specifications into the metric
system, lire, and Italian.
By September, in spite of setbacks,
preparations were moving impatiently to
a climax. After some management
doubts about their box-office potential,
Rex Harrison had been engaged to play
Caesar, and Richard Burton had been
brought out of his current Broadway
show, “Camelot,” to do Antony. Miss
Taylor arrived and moved into a large
villa with her husband. Eddie Fisher,
her three children, several maids, five
dogs and two cats. Her personal physi-
cian had been engaged to attend her at a
fee of $25,000 (£9000) for six weeks,
plus expenses.
Props, home-made or imported,
poured in l6O large statues, 15.000
bows and quivers, 10,000 spears, a pair
of elephants, camels, jackasses, cats, nu-
merous horses, and the asp.
Some of the hold-ups were provoking
to men who were trying to take a sober
but stately view of their art. Once they
needed a dozen figs for the Queen’s bas-
ket the asp’s hide-out. The director
had rejected the plastic ones. So, for
days, the props department was pre-
occupied with a fig-hunt.
Ready or not, the appeals and orders
from New York headquarters compelled
a start. The management was desper-
ately unhappy that $70,000 a day was
slipping away in overheads before any-
thing was being registered on film. On
September 25, on one of the few sets that
were ready, the cameras rolled for the
first time.
Within a few days they had to move
out-of-doors, but Fox’s gamble with the
Italian autumn did not come off. The
rain came and stayed.
When they tried to shoot the Trium-
phal Entry scene, after weeks of re-
hearsing its 6000 extras, animals, dan-
cers, charioteers, acrobats, a day of rain-
clouds cost them $200,000 of non-film.
As the winter came in, so did new
sources of tension and alarm. The costs
of the production were running at about
$500,000 'a week with the film barely
half-finished. They had $9,500,000 on
loan from banks at high rates of interest,
another $25 million from insurance
companies at long-term rates, and other
cash drawn from company funds.
There w'as a growing unease among
many of Fox’s 15,000 stockholders.
Relatively few of them had big holdings;
it was a stock widely spread among the
American public parcels of a few


score or hundreds of shares owned by
California lawyers, grocers in Illinois,
old ladies in Wichita Falls who liked,
the brokers say, to have a sensible finan-
cial stake in the romance of the motion-
picture.
They had seen the value of their
shares, normally very static, fluctuate
with the fortunes of “Cleopatra,” usually
downward, with intermittent recoveries.
The Whip Cracks
T>y early 1962 things were moving
rapidly to a conclusion.
Fox had managed to insure Miss Tay-
lor’s life for $lO million at about treble
the normal premium, a risk and profit
shared by a consortium of 15 of
America’s biggest insurance companies;
but since her serious London illness in
1961 no company would insure either
her health or the production against loss
on that account.
Yet it was not the star’s health exactly
that, in January, 1962, raised the appre-
hension of board and management to a
new peak. It came out that Antony and
Cleopatra had been continuing their at-
tachment off-screen.
At the same time the management's
whip was beginning to crack more
threateningly round the ears of the pro-
duction team. The position of Skouras,
the Fox president, was now highly pre-
carious. Whether the destination of the
company turned out to be a financial
wilderness or an unsuspected El Dorado,
he could take much of the credit or
blame for leading them there; and cer-
tainly, at this moment, there were no
glints of gold in sight.
On May 15, Skouras went into the
stockholders’ meeting in New York pre-
pared to defend himself against the
worst. He had no “Cleopatra” to show
(his ships and legions were still being
assembled for the critical naval battle)
and he had to report losses of more than
$22 million for 1961.
But his misgivings were premature.
Only 200 of the 15,000 stockholders
were present, and the sniping from the
floor was less than deadly. One stock-
holder complained that a switch from
cash to stock dividends had watered the
value of shares. A woman songwriter
proposed Miss Taylor for a directorship
as the only way to get some of her salary
re-invested in Fox.
Skouras countered these mild signs of
rebellion with a statement that all sal-
aries above SSOO a week had been cut
(his own from $139,000 a year to
$90,000), adding an assurance that
“Cleopatra” would be on the market by
February, 1963, and would gross $l5O
million, “the greatest of all time.”
Warm applause greeted this. The
president was re-elected. After refresh-
ments and a trailer showing other com-
ing releases (it had generally escaped
attention that there were any others)
the stockholders amiably dispersed. A
few days later one paper reported Asp
Bites Liz Worst Now Over. But,
of course, it wasn’t.
At this point the camera turns to a
solitary, pensive figure pacing a Nor-
mandy beach. Darryl F. Zanuck had
been shooting his D-Day picture, “The
Longest Day.” But “Cleopatra” had also
been intruding a beachhead of worry.
For one thing, he was the company’s
largest individual stockholder, with
104,000 shares. Then, for 20 years, dur-
ing its most prosperous period—until he
went off as an independent producer —
he had run the show as studio chief.
Both ways, he felt a proprietary interest
in Fox.
Through that summer, as Zanuck's
anxiety about the company grew, he
began to commute weekly to New York
to consult friends and see how the wind
was blowing. He didn’t like the bankers’
plans; he didn’t like the prospect of
liquidation; and he didn’t like the idea of
an “accountancy expert, a non-show-
man,” getting the presidency.
His next move was to put himself
forward as a candidate and confront
the board’s selection committee. It
was a dramatic and piquant moment.
On the one hand there was John Loeb,
one of the three most influential men on
the board, the patrician ruler of an
investment empire from an eyrie high
up on Wall Street. On the other, Zanuck,
the breezy romantic from Wahoo, Ne-
braska.
Loeb smoothly pointed out that five
out of six of Zanuck’s last productions,
largely vehicles for actresses whose
talents he thought he had descried, had
lost Fox $6 million. Zanuck’s simple re-
joinder was to threaten a proxy fight
unless he got the presidency. By the time
the next meeting came round, Skouras,
on the understanding that he would re-
main as chairman of the board, backed
Zanuck’s stock with his personal 100,000
shares and proposed him for the pre-
sidency.
The board was divided. The bankers
were firmly against either Skouras or
Zanuck though Robert Lehman, at
the last minute, said he was ready to
see the new man have a try. Zanuck
helped to convince waverers with
assurances that if he became president
he would not waste a cent and would
stick to Hollywood for future film-
making except when local color was
vital. “You shot an American movie in
Rome what’s authentic about that?”
he said. Finally Loeb, Rosenman and
Gould alone stood out against him. He
was elected by eight votes to three, and
his opponents resigned from the board.
The effect on the company was in-
stantaneous. Zanuck men poured into
jobs at all levels.
Eight or nine desert-hunting expedi-
tions were mounted. "We tried Morocco,
but didn't go for the political situation,”
recalled one explorer. “Then Spain, then
Libya. No good either. Finally we ended
up in Egypt.” One reason for settling
there was a hint from President Nasser
that several thousand Egyptian troops
would be available as extras at $1 (7s.
4d.) a day, a bargain not to be missed.
When the team got there, they found
the army rates had rocketed and it was
just as cheap to rent civilians.
The movie-makers pitched their tents
in a suitably rolling sandscape near
Edkou. 20 miles from Alexandria, sur-
rounded by electric fly-catchers. The
props-men set about learning ancient
techniques with sand-sledges to move
heavy equipment, and set close guard on
their props, having found that the
fellahin of the villages, in their chronic
need for firewood or simply things to
possess, would seize anything they could.
About 3,000 extras were mustered,
a large group from Alexandria, the re-
mainder from the villages. No one quite
knows what went wrong. Perhaps it was
rural resentment at having their dollar
area invaded by city men; possibly some
obscure vendetta of Arab politics. The
dismal fact was that fighting broke out
among the extras before they had time
to get their screen armour on.
High-level Tussle
HThe next thing that happened was that
Zanuck, the new president, dis-
charged Mankiewicz. He said Man-
kiewicz was to blame for the cost of
the picture. He, Zanuck, would do the
final editing in person.
The Zanuck-Mankiewicz tussle lasted
months, the essence of the argument
being that the president wanted to see
more “showmanship” in the picture,
while the director's more subtle theatri-
cal spirit cowered at the prospect. Re-
conciliation came at last; and in Feb-
ruary, 1963, Mankiewicz found himself
standing on a windy hill in southern
Spain, with $2 million more to spend,
directing large battle-scenes which the
previous management had vetoed.
For the next two months the film shut-
tled to and fro between Mankiewicz
in Hollywood and Zanuck in New York,
sharing the editing process as a sort of
needle tennis match. So it reached
Broadway and. the other day, London.

Holiday in Noumea
The Paris End of the South Pacific
By DAVID MARTIN
This is a country where first impres-
sions are misleading. If you hap-
pen to live near the centre of
Noumea by the Place des Cocotiers,
where no coconuts grow, you feel it
should be renamed Place des Cocottes.
But, in fact, New Caledonia is a rather
respectable island. Even Noumea is not
a wide open town, once you get beyond
the dusty square where the popinees
circulate round the music shell where
the convict bands used to play, near
the monument which shows Governor
D'Orly accepting the surrender of the
warlike tribes. The lush hinterland is
a paradise for old-fashioned stockmen,
with fat cattle roaming among moun-
tains that are knobs of ore, but fresh
milk is unknown and, since the Japanese
were kicked out, fresh vegetables are
hard to obtain in most places.
The Japanese have gone, but New
Caledonia depends on Japan for her
prosperity they buy the nickel. They
didn’t buy much last year, and things
got a bit rough. There is advanced social
legislation, but no unemployment in-
surance, and many workless miners drift
back to their tribe to live on yams, taro
and bananas.
But it is a magnificent piece of earth,
and one wonders why Australians don’t
go there in droves. After all, it takes
only two jet hours from Sydney. (New
Zealanders, who are much more in evi-
dence, fly to Noumea for half the price,
by conventional planes.) Is it the high
cost of living that puts us off? This is
also deceptive; spending a month in
New Caledonia can be cheaper than a
Queensland holiday. And look what you
get for your money. Shady beaches
guarded by a reef that keeps sharks at
bay, the world’s best spear fishing, good
cooking despite the avalanche of cans,
a climate that rivals Hawaii’s and a
people so racially mixed that the place
is a delight to the eye. No one will ask
you about the White Australia policy,
because nobody cares. Caledonians are
not much more interested in Australia
than we are in them.
Racial mixture: a Brazil in miniature.
38,000 indigenous, 12,000 mixed bloods
and 27,000 whites ... in other words,
this is no longer a colony where a
pale minority lords it over a dark major-
ity. Some go so far as to say that here
is a minute new nation in the making,
French, but with a difference. The Brous-
sards, white colonists of the interior,
resemble the Australian bushman in type
and outlook; they are tough, independ-
ent-minded, democratic. If there is any
tension it is not between them and the
natives but between true Caledonians
and metropolitain s . That’s not a new
story, of course. Something similar is
found in many distant dependencies of
Europe, but in New Caledonia it has
become quite a problem. “One fine
day,” a hawk-nosed colon said to me
on the bus to Plum, “we’re going to
inarch to Noumea and throw them into
the sea.”
This can be discounted, I suppose.
But now that France has lost North
Africa and Indo-China, many displaced
functionaries, people who previously
would not have dreamt of seeking a
career so far off the main road, have
made their home, and a very nice home
at that, in New Caledonia. They enjoy
certain minor financial advantages re-
sented by the Caledonians and they nat-
urally take the plum jobs reserved for
specialists. Some of them don’t like De
Gaulle, a hero to the islanders, who rose
for him in 1940 when most other ter-
ritories humbly sat down under Petain.
I daresay it will all come out in the
wash, eventually, as things usually do in
French Polynesia. (Though the island
natives are 80 per cent Melanesian.)
Once the nickel exports pick up and full
advantage is taken of a big electrifica-
tion scheme, that is, when the boom hits
its stride again, there will be other mat-
ters to think about.
Nobody considers cutting the painter.
New Caledonia needs France to balance
her budget; it is a question merely of
how to handle Paris. In return, Paris
sees to it that the Caledonians do not
forget the old connection. The place is
swarming with sailors, soldiers and air-
men, a reminder that France’s is a
military regime. Indigenous boys are
not called to the colors but may serve
as volunteers. French export houses con


trol the Caledonian trade too much
so for business progress, one often hears
said —but French goods are not exempt
from the flat 25 per cent impost on
entry. For the rest there are ample
bursaries for local students to receive
a tertiary education in France, air-lifts
in quantity of white and black digni-
taries to visit the homeland on national
occasions, and the arrival, each week,
of transport planes loaded to the ceiling
with wine, cheese and northern flowers.
La Presence Francaise is guaranteed as
far ahead as one can see.
What would it be like to live in
Noumea? Very pleasant but not very
stimulating. The town, nestling under
the cathedral against the hills, is pretty,
with an atmosphere of its own. It has
its own little Latin Quarter, corners
here and there which call to mind New
Orleans, and it is ten times cleaner than
Papeete. It has some splendid modern
buildings too, like the Law Courts and
the flats built for regular officers. It
has three ravishing bayside suburbs,
apart from Anse Vata, the mecca of
the tourists and the home of the South
Pacific Commission. It has half a dozen
night clubs, some patronised by Tahitian
guitarists and some by Wallis Islanders.
There is a daily newspaper run by an
enterprising Paris journalist but with
little foreign news. Good bookshops are
not lacking.
A French provincial town in the
Pacific, then, where the Tour de France
attracts more attention than any “great”
event, a town without a theatre, a town
of 30,000 inhabitants where you can
live well on the £AISO a month you
would earn as a highly skilled white
mechanic, and not too badly on the
£ABO you would draw as a trained
nurse. No income tax! Of course, you
would have your little 2CV Citroen or
Renault, but if not, you are served by a
public transport system which must be
pro rata the best in the world. (Each
minibus sports its own name, painted
on the door. One canny proprietor calls
his “Ansett,” with an eye on the future.)
Social gradings
"IT'or colored people life is much harder,
the effects of inflation more pain-
ful. Skilled workers earn about a
third less than their white colleagues,
and wages for the unskilled, who have
no strong unions to protect them, are
low by Australian standards. It is on this
level that discrimination is practised; on
any other the color bar, what there is
of it, operates so subtly as almost to
escape notice. One well established citi-
zen told me that the kanake he would
consider asking to dinner would have
to be one of the three native Ministers
of the Territorial Assembly, or perhaps
a leading tribal chief preferably a
Loyalty Islander. Others, however, deny
that this is typical.
There seem to be as many social
gradings, bearing on inter-marriage, for
instance, as there are color shadings:
with Vietnamese ladies near the top,
followed by Tahitians who, for some
reason are regarded as whites, then
Javanese, and so down to dusky Cale-
donian girls. The latter, admittedly, are
rarely attractive by our standards and,
when they have had recourse to the
peroxide bottle, can be startlingly ugly.
But the children of all races, playing and
learning together, are completely de-
lightful. Since concubinage affords a
convenient short-cut through matri-
monial taboos, a fair proportion enter
the world by the side door.
Genealogical tables are bewildering in
the extreme. I met one young man
whose paternal great-grandfather was a
political deporte of the Paris Commune
of ’7l, sent to languish on the Isle of
Pines, the present Surfers Paradise of
New Caledonia. His maternal grand-
mother was Chinese, his mother Japan-
ese and his father part Somali and part
Irish. This happy melange is, to some
extent, due to the influx of indentured
labor, a system now abandoned. Of
some three and a half thousand Ton-
kinese, originally brought in to work in
the mines, few will remain in a few
months when repatriation to North
Vietnam has been completed.
The French have learned well the
lesson of the long series of Kanaka wars
which came to an end only in 1919.
Nowadays the tribals enjoy substantial
protection. Nobody who has no business
there is allowed in the reserved areas.
Land alienation has stopped. Otherwise
there are no petty restrictions, though
hard liquor must not be sold to natives.
The matter is handled tactfully: be-
cause Pernod allegedly excites them too
much it is forbidden to all inhabitants.
Everyone has the vote and elections are
hotly contested.
The politics of the island have little
in common with those of France. Like
other Frenchmen, nowadays, Caledoni-
ans don't like to discuss De Gaulle and
his objectives. There are two main par-
ties, the Partie de l’Union Caledonienne
and the Partie de l’Union Nationale
Republicaine. The former is the party
of the have-nots, the latter of the con-
servative forces. Both are pledged to
close links with France.
Union Caledonienne, slightly the
stronger of the two, is led by a colorful
character, the Deputy Lenormand, a
metropolitan of long residence, mar-
ried to a native woman. Lenormand was
the first to see the possibilities in a
multi-racial party and today he draws
the bulk of his support from the colored
electorate. His platform is social-demo-
cratic, though his enemies mutter that
he is appealing to such base instincts
in his indigenous followers as a desire
for the return of old grazing lands.
He co-operates closely with the power-
ful Catholic Church (powerful but not
exclusive, for there is a sizeable Protes-
tant minority), and he fights against the
handful of monopoly houses which have
long cornered the internal trade.
Under a cloud
At present M. Lenormand is under a
cloud, having been found guilty of
being implicated in a plastic bomb plot.
An appeal is still pending in this extra-
ordinary affair. In April of last year a
petard went off in the Union Cale-
donienne’s own headquarters, at the
time of a dispute with the almighty
Compagnie Le Nickel. It is claimed that
it was placed there by Lenormand’s own
intimates as a provocation. To make
the little drama still more dramatic, one
of the convicted plotters is an Israeli,
a one-time militant of Irgun. This is
the sort of thing you don’t expect to
find in the Pacific but then there
are many things equally unexpected that
happen in New Caledonia. For example:
this is the only country in the world
where you see black lasses, dressed in
voluminous Mother Hubbards, play
cricket on the dusty lawn in front of
the principal barracks. Their gusto
would put the West Indians to shame . ..
Easily the most beautiful part of the
island is the north-east coast, from
Huailou to Hienghene, nearly 400 kilo-
metres from Noumea. You have the
choice of two approaches: by one of
those amazing little Renault buses to
Bourail, where you cross the central
mountain chain, or by light Transpac
plane directly to Houailou. The second,
if anything, is the more breath-taking,
for from the air you begin to under-
stand why New Caledonia is called a
“geographical scandal.” The whole is-
land is one vast metal and mineral
deposit.
You look down on hill-top after hill-
top, decapitated by open-cut mining.
The serpentine tracks that lead to the
summits, looking like the red gashes
from which gum sap trickles down rub-
ber trees, are trails for lorries or pack-
horses. What does not come out of these
ochre-tinted mountain flanks! Above all
nickel, 15 per cent of the world’s sup-
ply, but also chromium (20 per cent of
the world’s total), iron of special quality
that is exported to Australia, cobalt,
gibberite and manganese. Further north

there is coal. There are literally scores
of small, quasi-independent mining con-
cerns, but the Compagnie le Nickel, an
international consortium with strong
German interests, dominates them all.
Cattle, wild and domesticated, graze
in the inaccessible looking valleys,
mainly to end up in an up-to-date meat-
packing plant. For long stretches the sea
is visible on either side, turquoise blue,
with river mouths opening into it every
few miles.
Beauties of Touho
3L7'et the land route also has its charms.
A The bus collects you from your
hotel door at a quarter past two in the
morning. A spectacular dawn finds you
sipping the good Caledonian coffee in
Bourail. By the time Huailou is reached
the sun is high. Then up a sort of minor
Grand Corniche through Ponerihouen and
Poindimie, by ferry after ferry, to, let
us say, Touho. Touho! A little spot fit
for travel agents’ prose. It has a single
hotel, but one which only a regrettable
etiquette prevents me from mentioning
it by name. What relaxed hospitality!
What sea-food! What a bay and what a
beach! Behind it those mountains, full
of deer and free of snakes, and the re-
mains of a little fort, covered with flam-
boyants and God knows what other
flowers. Then Hineghene, at the end of
the road, brooding but beautiful in its
majestic inlet, guarded by rocks of
which one claims to look like Napo-
leon’s hat. Keep your fashionable Isle
of Pines, but I am going back to the
east coast, to Touho.
The Administration, very thoughtfully,
at the entrance to each tribal village,
puts up a gate on which the name of
the tribu appears, together with that of
the major or minor chief dwelling there.
Native prosperity fluctuates with the
state of the coffee market export of
copra has proved unprofitable and
the budget is eked out by a generous
child-allowance to which a father is
entitled if he can show that he has
worked 18 days in a given month. Nia-
ouli, a kind of eucalypt, is exploited for
its aromatic essence.
Don’t go looking for folklore and
old crafts; there’s not much to be found,
just as hardly anything survives, after
a century of missionary work, of the
old animist customs, except here and
there a little secret medicine. They still
dance the Pilou-Pilou at the drop of a
shell, but that’s not half as popular as
the übiquitous table football that is
played outside every second shop. Totem
poles have become as rare as shark
attacks.
The most solemnly affecting survival
is the War Memorial Hut erected by
the Tribu de Bayes, a typhoon-battered
structure of tradition, sacred to the
memory of indigenous poilus who died
in the war of 1914-18. The saddest
sight of all are the sleeping mats of the
fallen which, disintegrating, are kept
within, sadder, perhaps, than the over-
grown little stone memorial, the other
side of Vieux Touho, that commemor-
ates the victims of the last Kanaka re-
bellion, a European family and a Tahi-
tian trooper. Not far from there, re-
clused in a tribal hut from which she
looks out over the sea, lives Mme. Bur-
chel, a French woman, whose son, skip-
per of the “Monique,” went down with
a hundred souls when his ship was lost
between this coast and the Loyalties,
over twenty years ago.
But there is a church, a little further
south, at Ometteux, that will dispel your
gloom. Its sides and altar wall are
covered with murals depicting Biblical
personages as island people: a Galilean
fisherman who is a Chinese, a popinee
with the baskets of loaves and fishes and
an Othello-like Saint Peter with his keys.
One of the memorable sights of New
Caledonia .. . though nothing is as mem-
orable as the little tropical aquarium at
Anse Vata which, alone, justifies the
trip.
Plan for Casino
HThere is talk about attracting more
A tourists to New Caledonia, especially
from Australia. A new luxury hotel is
going up at the Baie des Citrons, plans
for a gambling casino are taking shape,
and when they are realised the Gold
Coast had better look out. Tourism is
vital to correct the one-sidedness of
New Caledonia’s economy, but inability
to pull together, and, maybe, a certain
disinclination to let go of French ex-
clusiveness, retards development.
The Messageries Maritimes, a ship-
ping line which couldn’t care less since
the Government guarantees it against
loss, hardly bothers to advertise its ser-
vice. On the other hand, it provides
steerage passage, recommended only to
youngsters who don’t mind roughing it
for three days and who are looking for
the cheapest holiday abroad that is open
to Australians. New Caledonia con
be done cheaply take your camping
equipment and motor bike or hire a
car when you get there. The roads are
not as bad as they are made out to be.
A friendly, intelligent people, a
beautiful country not yet spoiled, one
of the loveliest harbors of the Pacific.
The British nearly got hold of part of
the Dependency, in 1853 when the New
Caledonia story really begins. They were
bluffed out of it by a quick-thinking
French admiral. I think we may be glad,
on the whole, that his bluff was not
called.

The Soviet’s Angry
Young Men
Winds of change?
By MERLE FAINSOD
Professor Merle Fainsod, who is
now touring Australia as this
year’s Dyason Memorial Lecturer, is
the Director of the Russian Research
Centre at Harvard University. This
article was originally an ABC Guest
of Honor talk.
What are the values and the atti-
tudes of Soviet young people?
What are the questions which
concern them? How do they differ from
the older generation? How do they
respond to the demands which the regime
makes on them?
The Soviet youth who is now
twenty-five was born a year after the
Great Purge in 1937; he was three years
old when the Nazis attacked the Soviet
Union in 1941, seven years old at the
end of World War 11, and fifteen when
Stalin died. The Soviet youth of twenty
was born in the middle of World War
11, was two years old when the war
ended, and ten when Stalin died. For the
generation of which we are now speaking
the Revolution, the Civil War, the collec-
tivisation of agriculture, the first Five-
Year Plan, the Great Purge, and even
the beginnings of World War II are
pages in the history books events
which they have not experienced and
which they take for granted. Their
adolescent years have been spent in the
post-Stalinist or the Khrushchevian era.
They have their own lives to live and
their own needs to fulfil. While most
would be prepared if necessary to fight
in defence of their country, they lack
the ideological zeal of their forebears,
and they have no burning desire to re-
peat the sufferings and privations which
their parents endured.
The difference in generational moods
sometimes finds expression at the very
highest political levels. Thus Khrushchev,
speaking for the older generation, ad-
monished the Fourteenth Congress of
Young Communists in 1962:
“You young people, don’t become
conceited; we haven’t lived for nothing,
you know, nor did we spend our time
swatting flies with our noses, as the say-
ing goes: I am proud of my generation,
of the fact that for a time we lived to-
gether with Lenin, that we participated
in the October Revolution, the Civil
War. People of the older generation
lived through hunger and devastation;
they restored the economy by heroic
effort, fought for the new cause at the
construction projects of the five-year
plans, served as soldiers in the Second
World War and defeated the most terrible
enemy of mankind fascism: Yes, we
are proud of our times. You, too, should
take pride in our times . .
Evidence of the decline of ideological
zeal among the youth can also be found
in Soviet literature. Thus the old fisher-
man of Yevtushenko’s poem “Winter
Station” proclaims to a member of the
younger generation:
1 well remember your mother’s friends
aflame
When they were young, with yearning
to create.
Yes, / remember them, their noble aim
Their passionate ideas and fierce de-
bate.
They were ridiculous sometimes, it is
quite true,
Their ideas were sometimes harmful,
we all know,
But I'll be frank, it worries me that
you
Or youngsters like you lack their drive
and go
And worst of all—maybe I’m wrong,
my friend —
Young thoughts with you are mighty
hard to find;
And after all a man is in the end
The same age as the thoughts that fill
his mind.
I say we’ve got young people, but no
youth.
And in Aksyonov’s novel, “Col-
leagues,” one of the heroes, reacting
against the steady ideological bombard-
ment from the Young Communist
League and the Party, declares: “I’m so
sick of all this grandiloquence, all these
lofty utterances . . . these words have
turned to trash. All they do is interfere
with my seeing life as it really is.”
Remarks such as these point up the
contrast between the idealised image of
Soviet youth as it is didactically ex-
pounded by Party ideologists, and the
operative morality of youth, as it is re-
vealed in reality. In the official image,
the overwhelming mass of Soviet young
people is portrayed as patriotic, dedi-
cated, and hardworking, whose aim in
life is to build the future Communist
society.
The operative morality of Soviet youth
is more earthy. Here, the paramount
drives are education, a good job, the
status and material satisfactions that go
with it, and a desire to find work in the

large cities, where entertainment, cultural
and educational facilities are available.
This is not to say that young people do
not, on occasion, volunteer for service
in remote areas or behave as the official
model prescribes. But there is also
plentiful evidence in the Soviet press
that many Soviet youths do everything
they can to avoid assignment to the
provinces. Thus, last year, only half the
teachers assigned by Russian Republic
universities to Tadzikistan schools
actually went there, and as many
specialists left Kazakhstan as were
assigned there.
One of the best ways to gain some
insight into the doubts, feelings, and
moods of the more thoughtful Soviet
young people is to read the young poets
and novelists whom they read and who
express their aspirations. To be sure,
many of these young writers, such as
Yevtushenko, Vosnesensky, and Rozh-
destvensky, have been subjected to sharp
attack by the Party bureaucrats, but this
does not render the evidence which they
provide less significant. What have
been the themes which they have been
sounding? For one thing, they call for
a sharp break with the Stalinist past.
Thus Yevtushenko in his poem “Stalin’s
Heirs”:
They even condemn Stalin from the
platform,
But themselves
at night
pine for the old days
They, once his lieutenants,
Do not like these times
When the camps are empty
And the halls where people listen to
poetry
Are crowded . . .
It is this spirit of individualism that
worries and troubles the Party orthodox.
One can also see the concern reflected
in the novels of the conservative writer,
Kochetov. In his story, “The Brothers
Yershov”, one of the characters says,
“They are even condemning Socialist
Realism . . . And ask your daughter how
matters are among certain students.
There is no clarity. All sorts of muck
is burgeoning.” And when the person
with whom he is conversing replies that
these are only mosquito bites, the answer
comes, “. . . But one mustn’t under-
estimate mosquitoes. From mosquito
bites, malaria develops, and from that,
one can shiver for several years”.
Judging by developments in the Soviet
literary front over the last year, Khrush-
chev, too,, has decided that one must
not underestimate mosquito bites. Com-
menting on a speech by Rozhdestvensky,
who asserted that it was the young writ-
ers who expressed the mind of youth,
Khrushchev replied in no uncertain terms
that it was the Party, and the Party only,
that had the right to speak for youth.
How will the young writers and their
clientele among the youth respond to this
forceful reassertion of Party guidance
and tutelage? In Aksyonov’s novel,
“Ticket to the Stars”, a group of young-
sters runs away from school in search
of independence. The end of the novel
finds them chastened and haltered;
indeed, one of the people who meets
them along the way prophesies, “These,
too, are going to get broken in some
day.” Is this to be the fate of the post-
Stalinist generation or will it find the
wa Y to greater liberty?
We do not know the answer. We
can only conclude, that our hopes for
the future of Russia lie with the young
people who have spoken out for free-
dom.

MOTORING
Newcomer from Japan
The Tiara has no surprises
By BOADICEA
Last month I wrote of the Toyota
Tiara, the H-litre Japanese car
which is assembled with 50 per
cent Australian content by Australian
Motor Industries in Melbourne, and is
the latest “Togo car” to attack our auto-
mobile market.
Since then I have been able, through
the help of a colleague, to drive one of
the Tiaras and assess how it measures
up to the Australian motorists’ concept
of what a car should be. Looking at the
car dispassionately it is hard to see any-
thing outstanding about it. The Tiara is
like a dozen others in shape and size
and is not in any way radical in design.
Feelings may rise because of the car’s
origin, but cases of Mercedes and Volks-
wagens being damaged or daubed with
swastikas are rare even in Europe, and
here the Datsun cars have already borne
the brunt, and successfully, of any ill-
feeling towards the product of our
former enemy. France, ever materialistic,
trades with old enemies, and so Australia
must with Japan. Provided the value is
there the Japanese car will be generally
accepted by all but a minority for whom
the scars of 1941-1945 will never heal.
But whereas the Datsun was some-
thing of a novelty and was fully im-
ported, the Tiara is no novelty and has
the old handicap of being locally
assembled. Although Australian work-
men have long proved they can finish
cars as well as the mass-produced
American and English vehicles, and in-
deed better than some Continentals—as
in the case of Citroen, Peugeot and
Renault—there is still some snob value
in the “fully imported” tag.
AMI makes a good job of finishing off
the Mercedes, yet I know many owners
who turn to the opposing Jaguar; for it
comes direct from the Coventry assembly
line and so is unsullied apart from the
frequent blemishes incurred in travelling,
loading and unloading. Therefore it
came as something of a surprise to find
that the all-important finish of the Tiara
was not as good as I’d hoped. I have
heard that Japanese inspectors at the
Fisherman's Bend assembly plant refused
to pass many of the first runs. This is
nothing new, for Volkswagen-Australasia
went through several difficult opening
weeks at their £l3 million Clayton
factory when Rudi Herzmer, holding a
watching brief for Wolfsburg, knocked
back the majority of a week’s produc-
tion. But this rigid inspection has paid
off handsomely for VWA whose products
are among the best made in the world.
AMI must do the same, for the Datsun
cars selling just under and just over the
Tiara’s price have the better-quality,
fully-imported look. At £915 the Tiara
has as opponents a host of small cars —■
Ford, Fiat, Hillman, Morris, Renault,
Skoda, Triumph and Volkswagen al-
ready well known to the Australian
buyer. It has the advantage over some
of having four doors and easy access
with its canted centre pillars. There is,
of course, a well-founded school of
thought that says two doors are better
than four, giving greater rigidity and
strength, so it is really a question of
personal requirements.
Tt does have a hefty H-litre engine,
more than some of its rivals, and
certainly it packs more wallop than the
Datsun, itself no sluggard from point to
point as the 95 mph downhill Datsuns
showed in the Bathurst 6-hour race last
October. Petrol consumption ranges
from 25/30 mpg.
The Tiara lacks two “extras” which
are gradually becoming standard fittings
on most cars —a heater/demister and a
screen washer. Interior finish is quite
austere, bench seats are used fore and
aft and instrumentation is basic. The
gearbox is three-speed and fully synchro-
meshed, and because of the pulling
power of the engine the Tiara drives
like a much larger car and continual
gear changing is not necessary.
This is a definite one-up for Tiara, for
four-speed transmissions in all but special
cases are on the way out just as surely
as automatic transmissions are on the
way in.
The Tiara uses the unitary construction,
combining chassis and body, and its sus-
pension has longitudinal torsion bars at
the front and long willowy semi-elliptic
springs at the rear. The Tiara’s odd
braking is peculiar to Japanese cars and
has been explained to me this way.
In Japan, with an almost all-over
speed limit of 50 kph, or a shade over
30 mph, brakes don’t come in for a
great deal of use and it is not uncommon
for linings to last 50,000 miles! They
like to make a feature of this and fit a
fairly hard lining which requires higher
than usual pedal pressure to get results.
Under Australian conditions the brakes
will doubtless outlast most others but
drivers will have to accustom themselves
to the higher pressures. Given a heavy
push the brakes are excellent, true and
powerful.
By way of a bonus the owner of a
Tiara gets a useful kit of tools and, with
simplicity being the keynote of the
design, periodic maintenance should be
both quick and cheap.
The home of the Tiara is Toyota City,
named after its number one product.
The company, with average export sales
of 1500-2000 vehicles a month, also
supplies 40 per cent of Japan’s home
market.
The assembly of Tiaras at Fisherman’s
Bend gives employment to 1100 Aus-
tralians, according to the latest Aus-
tralian Motor Industries’ hand-out.
At present I can see the Nissan Datsun
group as its main stumbling block, and
whereas the local Tiara agents doubtless
curse the already entrenched Datsuns,
the Datsun salesmen welcome the Tiara
as it helps spread the Japanese car
image. The Nissan Datsun distributors
have an impressive range of imported
merchandise with the luxury Cedric
saloon and the seven-seater Cedric
wagon, both with impeccable finish inside
and out, as well as the special and de-
luxe versions of the Datsun Bluebird.
The only immediate criticism one could
level at the Cedric car and wagon are
that they are so superior they deserve
six-cylinder engines and automatic trans-
missions, both of which I assume are on
the way. Power brakes are now being
offered as optional equipment on Cedrics
which will take the effort out of braking
the relatively large car. Not content with
small and large cars and Wagons, Datsun
are introducing their superb Fairlady
sports car, which should shake up the
lethargic world of sports car selling in
Australia. The Fairlady starred at the
recent Sydney Trade Fair.

US Road
To Racial
Equality
Long , Rough and Slow
gEYOND court rulings and paper laws to advance the American Negro
towards equality with his white fellow-citizen lies the slower-changing and
eccentric pattern of life in the deep South. Here the road is hard and
daunting.
John Garrard, a British student, has spent an exchange year at Reed
College, Portland, Oregon. He studied the racial problem with special
concern for the Negro opportunity to work and the right to vote —a range
of inquiry that has had less attention in the outside world than the more
spectacular aspects of Negro revolt and enforced symbolic desegregation.
All too often the problem of Negro
employment in the southern
states of America is an apparently
unbreakable chain of three links: the
employer who will not take on Negroes
above the level of janitor; the poorly-
equipped Negro school which gives
inadequate vocational training; and the
Negro student who lacks interest in
vocational training anyway, because in
the eyes of potential employers it will
qualify him to be no better than a janitor.
For the colored student who wins a
college degree and wishes to use it, the
choices are usually the simple ones of
becoming a teacher or a minister, or of
trying his luck by going North.
The Southern Regional Council (a
group of liberals dedicated to the pro-
position that Southerners can play a
major part in solving the problems of the
area) has conducted surveys in three
Southern cities. It gives the following
situations as typical:
In Chattanooga, Tennessee, a major
department store employs one hundred
Negroes, all as maids, janitors or porters.
The highest job level reached here is a
head porter. A store official estimated
that more than one quarter of its business
is with Negroes.
Local offices of two large insurance
companies employ no Negroes above
“custodial” rank. None of their 200
agents is a Negro, but half the life in-
surance business is with Negro customers.
A variety chain store reported “good
experience” with Negro employees, but
employed only one Negro who installs
and repairs air conditioners, does clean-
ing and supervising janitors. His official
classification: “Porter”.
In Atlanta, Georgia, the city’s largest
department store desegregated its lunch
counters after weeks of Negro boycott,
but does not employ a single Negro sales-
man.
The local branch of a national variety
store has one Negro with 15 years’ ser-
vice: described as being “next to the
manager”, but no official title specified.
In Houston, Texas, a steel company on
government contract work has no Negro
supervisor of either skilled or unskilled
workers.
In a large oil and gas firm, Negroes
and whites are not in competition for
jobs in any section. A Negro may become

J supervisor of other Negroes, but not
f whites.
This selection gives a fairly balanced
picture. The Negro is usually employed
below his capacity; and where limited
promotion is available, he is often paid
a rate well below that given to a white
man for the same job.
Where firms have Government con-
tracts the situation has begun to change
more rapidly since the Kennedy Adminis-
tration started pulling the non-discrimina-
tory strings usually embodied in such con-
tracts. The private employer, however,
has still a wide variety of means to ward
off the Negro who wants a better job.
The applicant may find the advertised
position has been “already filled”— often
by a white man who applied three days
later. Or the Negro’s qualifications may
be “not quite good enough”.
Some employers advertise only under
the protection of a box number, and
applicants are required to write giving
their address and school. A quick glance
at the street map or the list of segregated
schools will ascertain whether the em-
ployer even needs to reply.
Attitudes built up in generations of
white supremacy play their part, but pure
color prejudice is too simple an explana-
tion of present-day discrimination.
A colored member of the American
Friends Service Committee working in
the field has found the convinced racist
employer is now something of a rarity.
She described the employer who told her
after an interview, “Well, you seem to
have explained this very coherently for
a Negress”, as a man “thick-headed
rather than prejudiced”. The old, thought-
less cliches remain
—Negroes are lazy,
unreliable, slow; but
they are more likely
to be excuses than
firm beliefs, as to a
lesser extent is the
frequent statement,
“I’m not prejudiced,
but this thing has to
move slowly . . .”
More frequently
the employer fears
the racial attitudes
of the community
on which he de-
pends. Northern
firms moving into
the South are often
worse than their established counter-
parts. The first organisation they contact
is the local chamber of commerce.
Retail stores particularly fear what will
happen if a white customer is served by
a colored sales assistant. The manager
of a department store in Atlanta, for
instance, agreed to employ Negro sales
assistants on condition that “light-color-
ed” applicants be found.
Another factor is the genuine fear that
advantage will be taken of the non-dis-
criminatory employer by a racist com-
petitor. Employers outside the retail
business usually refuse to have their
names published if they agree to desegre-
gate their workers.
A firmly-held fear is that white em-
ployees will leave if they find Negroes
working with them. Such fears are not
entirely groundless, but a determined
employer can usually overcome white em-
ployee opposition by calling their bluff.
All these beliefs have acquired the
force of habit, and habit dies hard in
the South.
The attitudes and habits of employers,
however, are not the only obstacles to
improved opportunity for Negroes. There
may be little incentive towards this among
Negroes themselves particularly the
more prosperous Negroes, the quite
sizeable middle-class group which has
been described as the “black bourgeoisie”,
Its members have their own small busi-
nesses which most Negroes use, being
unable to go anywhere else, and they
have gained a certain status in their com-
munity, their own Negro friends. They
have thus acquired a vested interest in a
segregated society. Why should they
compete with whites in the employment
field, or anywhere else, when their status-
seeking can find ample and easier satis-
faction in a Negro group which sets
lower standards of qualification?
In this sort of environment it is not
surprising that many Negro children
grow up without a sense of wider
vocational aspiration,
Southern schools, whether white or
black or both, have
lower standards than
those in the North.
One employment
worker trying to
persuade an em-
ployer to take on a
colored secretary
was told: “I don’t
care what the color
is just find me
someone who can
write Eng 1 i s h.”
Negro college gradu-
ates, asked to
“pioneer” in secre-
tarial work, often
became bored
through being em-
ployed below their capacity, and leave,
thus giving the employer further ground
to complain that the Negro is unreliable.
High school graduates, unable to find
employment as secretaries in firms who
consider their qualifications, with some
justice, too low, or for other reasons re-
ject them, either accept employment be-
low their capacity or move out of the
area.
Of the organisations attempting to
combat these problems, one of the most
interesting yet least publicised is the
American Friends Service Committee.
The Quakers are a peace church and the
Committee relies wholly on “confronta-
tion” and persuasion. The Quakers aim at
the employer’s conscience and self-
interest at the same time. If an employer
claims he cannot find a Negro secretary
with sufficient qualification, they try to
find him one. If he fears the effect on
customers or white employees, they point
to other employers who have desegregated
without trouble. If the employer then
agrees to desegregate, the Committee
counsels the most tactful way of carrying
this out.

American Friends Service Committee to
enable potential “pioneers” in newly-
integrated firms, to understand and to
overcome problems. Efforts have been
made to secure non-discriminatory train-
ing facilities at State-supported industrial
education centres. There is a public
speaking programme, primarily in high
schools to increase the awareness of jobs
becoming available.
On the other hand, organisations like
the Georgia Council on Human Relations
and the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People rely
on more militant methods such as boy-
cotts of retail firms. Such a policy some-
times has more immediate effect than
confrontation and persuasion, but the
work often interlocks. Boycotts cannot
be operated against non-retail firms which
have no contact with the general public.
In these cases persuasion and confronta-
tion works best. But it is not unknown
for retail firms, who have at first refused
persuasive advice and then found them-
selves boycotted by the National Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Colored
People (NAACP), to negotiate with the
American Friends Service Committee
(AFSC) to save face, the Quakers being
the lesser of two evils in their eyes.
Progress in the field of equal employ-
ment is slow. Spectacular advances are
rare because of the entrenched attitudes
of employers, because of poor Negro
education, and because private employers
cannot be challenged in the courts for
discriminatory practices. Progress will
continue at this slow rate until employers
realise that the South cannot afford to
have so much of its creative talent
skimmed off to the North and West. And
the more the South industrialises, the
more pressing will this problem become.

“T tell you, Captain, we’re a little fed
up with this voter registration busi-
ness,” said the Sheriff of Terrel County,
in Georgia. “We want our colored
people to live like they’ve been living
for the last 100 years, peaceful and
happy.”
In areas of the southern states of
America, where white resistance to the
Negro exercising his vote remains a con-
stant factor, methods of resistance have
changed in recent times from the purely
violent ways used by the Ku Klux Klan
mass burnings and lynchings to
subtler methods used by the White Citi-
zens’ Councils.
These include threats of violence
rather than actual violence, stringent use
of literacy tests and the poll tax, disen-
franchisement on obscure points of pro-
cedure, and “go-slow” devices used by
registration officers and in legal proceed-
ings. These are often more difficult to
combat than violence.
Meanwhile, in areas where white
resistance has diminished, a new problem
has emerged; Negro apathy, due not only
to old fears, but also to the very fact
that white resistance has broken down
before communal militancy had been
fully built up. Two remarks by Negro
leaders illustrate this aspect. One said:
“They’re not interested now; complacency
has set in.” The other said: “If they were
prohibited maybe it would be different.”
White resistance varies from place to
place, generally becoming stronger in
proportion to the percentage of potential
Negro voters, and as one moves from
urban to rural areas and deeper into
the South.
Thus, North Carolina’s comparatively
mild literacy test is administered with
impartiality, and only a minimal standard
is required to read the registration oath.
The whole business takes about two
minutes.
In Raleigh, North Carolina, a city on
the fringe of the Deep South, a National
Student Association project found 4500
Negroes registered out of a possible
12,000, and in an eight-weeks’ campaign
they got 1500 more on the register.
Similar success was achieved in Durham,
North Carolina, and in Jackson, Ten-
nessee. In all three places few deterrents
were encountered and the project was

greatly helped- by capable local Negro
leadership.
But in other places resistance is formi-
dable. In the literacy test, instead of a
short oath, the applicant may be required
to read out long passages from the State
constitution to a white registrar determin-
ed to pass as few Negroes as possible.
Mispronunciation of words, because of
local dialect, may lead to disqualification.
An applicant may also be required to
answer questions on the United States
Constitution which even legal experts
find almost impossible to answer.
In place of oral tests there may be a
written test containing up to 30 questions.
Not uncommon among these is: “What
race are you?” Applicants who write
“Negro” have often been told that regi-
stration cannot be allowed because the
answer should have been “Colored.”
But had their answer been “Colored”
then the correct version can be changed
to “Negro.”
If, by some miscarriage of injustice,
an applicant manages to slip through
the net, determined white registrars have
been known to invent a few additional
questions, such as: “How many seeds in
a water melon?” The result is not merely
to deny rights to individual Negroes; it
creates an atmosphere of deterrence to
Negro groups as a whole.
Using the technique of going slow, a
registrar can make the process for a single
applicant last three hours. Alternatively
he can arbitrarily close the registration
books long before the usual time.
Another pseudo-legal tactic sometimes
used in the South is known as “the
purge”, whereby those already registered
find their names suddenly removed from
the register. It is an old dodge, and was
used by the Citizens’ Council of Louisi-
ana in 1956.
The purge started in Quachita Parish
of Monroe. By working day and night
in the registrar’s office, the Citizens’
Council prepared forms by which every
one of the 5782 Negro voters’ qualifica-
tions could be challenged. By mid-April,
3000 challenges had been allowed, and
since most of the Negroes failed to gain
retractions of these challenges, their
names were erased from the registration
rolls. In every case some slight error, real
or supposed, had been found in their
original registration forms. By May, when
the election for mayors began, only 595
Negro voters were on the rolls. Before
the purges Louisiana had the highest
percentage of registered Negroes in any
southern state.
Memories of lynching
JLTiolence as a means of discouraging
' the Negro voter has tended to de-
crease but the implied threat of violence
is often enough to awaken Negro
memories of lynching. And there are
other methods of intimidation. Negro
teachers often find it imprudent to take
part in Negro registration drives, or
register themselves, in case they lose their
jobs. White employers sometimes refuse
to take on any Negro who has registered
as a voter. In 1962, in Fayetteville
County, North Carolina a rural area,
where there are three Negroes to every
two whites —the share-cropping contracts
of many Negroes were not renewed when
they tried to register. Many were forced
to move.
Age plays a major part in the pattern
of registration, for older people have
longer memories, more ingrained habits
of thinking, and tend to see the value of
voting on grounds of material benefits
less clearly than the 21 to 40 age group.
Their attitudes are more likely to have
become fixed by the traditional “Southern
way of life.”
The quality of Negro leadership is also
a factor, and equally important is the
question of whether the Negro has links
with the white power structure. There
is corruption on both sides.
The National Student Association Pro-
ject in Raleigh, North Carolina, found
that the biggest factor in the reluctance
of Negroes to register was apathy.
Apathy in turn was a compound of the
fear of doing what they had never done
before, and the feeling of “What good
can we do?” a feeling of impotence
built up by years of subordination and
poor education. There is also mistrust
of canvassers, especially if they are white:
the suspicion that the only thing the
canvassers want is a Negro’s vote, not an
assertion of his rights. Apparent apathy
also disguises the desire to hide a criminal
record which disqualifies coupled
with the fear that registration may result
in investigation of unpaid taxes. This is
a groundless fear now, but Negroes
remember that in 1940 this was done
deliberately in North Carolina.
Poor Negroes are to be found who
are unwilling to register because they
believe that by voting they are in some
way helping the richer colored elements
of their community without any return
for their trust. Finally, both white and
Negro integrationists point to a quite
sizeable “Uncle Tom” element. This
ranges in expressions from: “It’s not my
business to tell them white folk what to
do,” or “Voting is white folks’ business”
to the notion of “Leave them white
folks alone don’t bother them, and
they won’t bother us.”
The frequent question of “What good
can I do?” may seem valid. What point
is there in asking Negroes to vote if
their local choice is between two or more
white segregationists? In the current
Mississippi gubernatorial Democratic
primary election (where victory is tanta-
mount to election as Governor) all three
candidates are strong segregationists, and
one of them, Lieutenant-Governor Paul
Johnson, entered the lists with a charge
of criminal contempt pending against
him for segregationist activity.
The answer integrationists give is that
the vote can be important in getting into
office the less obnoxious candidate. Thus
in an earlier Georgia Democratic pri-
mary, the Atlanta vote and that of the
surrounding area was crucial in winning
the election of Carl Sanders, a mild
racist, as candidate for Governor, instead
of Marvin Griffin, a notorious segre-
gationist.
Needed: A sense of solidarity
11/here the choice lies only between two
equally obnoxious candidates, the
usual advice of such organisations as the
NAACP is “vote against the incumbent.”
Southern politicians are likely to take
more notice of a large percentage of
registered voters because of their poten-
tial veto power, whether they vote or not.
Many politicians, if they do not actively
woo the Negro vote by making conces-
sions, at least are usually careful not -o
create too much Negro hostility.
Roy Wilkins, executive secretary of
the NAACP, is among those who believe
the Negroes themselves hold the key to
their own political future. He says:
“There is no attempt to under-estimate
the forces of resistance, the ignorance,
trickery, fear, threats and physical
assaults that have been employed and will
continue to be employed. But their
eradication will not be accomplished by
some miracle out of the sky ... It will
be done primarily through the intel-
ligence, diligence, persistence and courage
of the population presently disenfran-
chised.”
What is still needed in the South is the
development among the Negroes of that
sense of group solidarity and comradeship
which brought the trades unions to the
fore in America and the Labor Party
to power in Great Britain, (ofns.)


Around Melbourne
SALVATION IN THE SHEEP PAVILION
TI/lelbourne has seen some mar-
vellous conferences, like the
Country Women’s Conference and
the World Power Conference, but I
don’t think we have ever seen any-
thing like the “Everlasting Good
News Assembly” of the Jehovah’s
Witnesses. There are 16,500 Jeho-
vah’s Witnesses in Australia, and we
had over 12,000 of them here in
Melbourne.
The organisation was really some-
thing, with fleets of special trains and
buses. For example, two special
trains with 784 delegates came
straight through from South Brisbane,
over 1000 miles in 32 hours. How
was that for a performance in rail-
way co-operation; something they had
never done before. Then 550 Wit-
nesses came on five trains from Perth,
price £16,450/5/9 the biggest
block of bookings ever made from
Perth for the transcontinental trip.
Then, of course, there were 116
delegates from overseas, including 71
Americans and 25 Canadians.
Headquarters for the assembly was
the Showground, and here organisa-
tion was in high gear. Car parking
was handled by attendants with
walkie talkies. There were loud
speakers everywhere. There were
field kitchens at the cattle pavilion
which turned out 60,000 meals at
4/6 and 2/6 each.
Then the grand gathering was in the
sheep pavilion, Australia’s biggest
shed. Many thought that this was a
nice Biblical touch, having all the
Witnesses in the sheep pavilion.
Of course, there was a public rela-
tions section, and it was here that
I met Donald Maclean, a Canadian,
and one of the top Witnesses in Aus-
tralia. He was good-looking, tactful,
nicely turned out. You could picture
Brother Maclean as the boss of a
smart advertising agency.
Brother Maclean said that the
Jehovah’s Witnesses were the fastest
growing religious sect in the world.
It was picking up members at the
rate of 1000 to 1500 a year in Aus-
tralia. That is, it was increasing at
the rate of 10 per cent a year. And
how was this done? “We do it by
door-knocking field service”, said
Brother Maclean. “We are Witnesses,
that’s part of our faith, so every
member is expected to do at least five
hours a week going from door to
door. In Perth, where we are strong-
est, we can get around every house
once every three weeks. We can visit
every house in Melbourne or Sydney
once every three months.”
Oh, yes, Brother Maclean admitted
that they had doors slammed in their
faces, insults, but they didn’t get
worried or upset. What they were do-
ing was an act of faith. In 95 per
cent of houses they met complete in-
difference. In the other 5 per cent
they got either real hostility or real
interest. And for those who were in-
terested they started an immediate
weekly course in Bible instruction.
He talked with his back to a wall
studded with carefully arranged Press
clippings. One of them pointed out
that apart from a £2/15/- monthly
allowance for things like toothpaste,
a car allowance for travelling and
“enough at the end of the year to
buy a suit”, Brother Maclean did not
get a salary.
time was almost 7.45 p.m. The
- great moment, the climax of the as-
sembly, had arrived; Brother F. W.
Franz, from Brooklyn, NY, vice-
president of the Watch Tower
Society, was to give his address,
“When God is King Over All the
Earth”. There were over 12,000 jam-
med into the huge pavilion and the
sight was almost unbelievable. The
Witnesses were all there with their
families. There were children on rugs,
children on the floor, children in
prams.
As crowds go, most of them look-
ed handsome and well-heeled. The
girls had their make-up and rinses,
but there were no cigarettes. Smok-
ing is unclean, according to Donald
Maclean. Frankly, I found it down-
right unnerving, being in the same
room with 12,000 non-smokers.
A choir of 50, accompanied by a
60-piece orchestra, gave us the
oratorio, “The Triumphant King-
dom”, then we heard from Brother
Franz. Brother Franz kept shooting
Biblical references at us and the keen
ones kept pace by flipping through
their Bibles.
He told us the story of the begin-
ning, how God the Creator created
Adam and Eve 6000 years ago and
placed them in the Garden of Eden.
Satan came, there was the Fall, and
Within 1700 years the earth became
filled with violence and corruption ...
“Was God concerned about this
condition in the earth that He had
created? Yes, indeed! Billions of tons
of water from the heavens were pre-
cipitated upon the earth for 40 days.
Noah’s Ark floated safely, but all the
world of corrupt people outside peri-
shed. What a warning this corruption
of a corrupt world by a global flood
is to us today, when the earth is once
again filled with violence, when vio-
lence in nuclear warfare threatens to
wipe out the human race without
God’s having to do it himself!”
It wasn’t easy to follow Brother
Franz’ message from here on, but
the basis seemed to be this. Accord-
ing to the Scriptures the end was at
hand. The base year was 1914, and
any time within a life span of 1914
we would have Armageddon. Only
those who bore witness to Jehovah,
just like Noah and his family, would
be saved. Then there would be a new
start to fill the earth with a righteous
race of humans. “There will be no
stillbirths or miscarriages or deform-
ed children. They will be born in
righteousness by righteous parents, in
God’s righteous New Order, and
there will then be no need for arti-
ficial birth control.”
This, said Brother Franz, would
continue for a limited time; then the
graves would be opened, and the bil-
lions of dead would be brought back
to life on earth. There would be no
overcrowding, for the earth, by intel-
ligent gardening under God’s guid-
ance, would become a paradise every-
where. It would be an end to man
government, for God would be king
over all the earth.
There was huge applause from the
12,000 in the sheep pavilion as they
clapped the Everlasting Good News.
Then Brother Franz went on his way
to repeat the story at other assemb-
lies in 24 principal cities around the
world.
And, as long as he has his facts
right, it is a most remarkable story
indeed.

EMIGRANTS MISLED?
Sir,
Regarding immigrants who return to
Britain (“Australia for a Ride”,
3/8/63), I think that the reason is to
be found in many instances in the advice
they receive before they leave their coun-
try. Some time ago when in Sydney I
told a fairly senior officer of the depart-
ment concerned that the basic informa-
tion handed out in London was so far
from the truth in most cases that the
authorities were guilty of misleading
simple people, who believed what they
were told simply because the in-
formation which they were given
was so heavily coated with sugar that
the bitter pill which they eventually came
to was not discovered until after they
had sold up and arrived in the new “land
of the free”. Like Communism, the in-
formation emphasises the something for
nothing, the £lO assisted passage, the
higher wages, the sunshine, the beaches
and so on.
The architects of this information are
not talking or writing to people who have
been brought up on their own particular
brand of meretricious public relations,
and those who have been based in Lon-
don for a number of years tend to get
that faraway look in their eyes when
describing Australia; they let their ima-
gination run riot, painting pictures of
golden opportunities in an ever-green
land, whilst Mr and Mrs Emigrant, who
happen to have six children for whom
they have to provide, listen boggle-eyed
and are carried away. They then proceed
to have their chests x-rayed, “sell-up”,
and are off to the other end of the world
well and truly indoctrinated and brain-
washed.
What are they leaving behind? A
Welfare State, free medical treatment,
good pay packets, holidays in Europe and
so on. What do they get on arrival? A
concentration camp, in one State or an-
other, where they have to wait until they
can raise the deposit on a block of land
so that they can build a house. There is
nothing wrong with all this, except that
the bald truth is not spoken in London
or elsewhere regarding the conditions.

CAIRNS
Sir,
Mr John Ellison (“Life and Death
of a Sugar Town”, 3/8/63) is ap-
parently the self-appointed expert on the
entire Far Northern economy. We take
in sugar, tourism, railways, apathy, in-
ertia, cattle and maize. We also get some
astonishing assertions . . .
“Much remains to be done to recap-
ture some of the lost tourist trade.” Does
he know that one man who went out of
house painting into motel keeping three
years ago is now so busy he’s taking on
extra staff? . . . “the cattle industry in
parts of Queensland has changed little
since Biblical days.” How the hell
would he know? Has he never heard of
the Droughtmaster, of improved pas-
tures, of men like Jim Rollinson and
Rob Whelan in Cape York Peninsula,
pouring their capital into improvements?
“ . . . many (farmers) are not prepared
to concede that fertiliser is vital.” The
derisive laughter from the Atherton
Tableland is still subsiding.
Not a word here about the £6 million
tobacco industry which has transformed
Mareeba and Dimbulah. Most of his
statements are just not factual. Northern
graziers did not “sneak in" last year to
slaughter at Queerah meatworks during
the dispute; no factories at all have yet
gone up on reclaimed land at Smith's
Creek; the unemployment figures are not
mounting (three weeks ago seven
Englishmen landed at Cairns out of
work and money and got jobs within
four days); for Ellison to spout know-
ingly about the highly complex timber
industry is just laughable.
And yet we read: “The overall story
of the north is one of tragedy boom-
ing towns turned to dust, playmates
Apathy and Inertia running happily all
over the place.” Wordy rubbish! Or later,
a claim by a city alderman (un-named)
that people “are not properly informed
of the real facts which go on in the town.”
What facts, Mr Ellison? Spare us any
more of yours.
PHILIP WILSON
Cairns (Qld).
Sir,
In Cairns a bulk sugar terminal (cost-
ing some £4 million) is being installed;
economic dieselisation ousts steam loco-
motives; steel railway wagons and steel
passenger cars replace wooden ones;
district located cane-harvesting machines
replace the tourist seasonal canecutter;
the Government assists the cost of opera-
tion of two mighty inland tin dredges
which produce a major portion of Aus-
tralia’s tin—and, according to Mr Ellison,
we’ve had it!
In agricultural and pastoral fields we’ve
also had it—or have we, when you look
at this? Between 1956-57 and 1961-62
increases in production rose from 2.3
million lbs to 9.4 million lbs of tobacco;
maize from 375,305 bushels to 571,517
bushels, peanuts from 2.2 million to 3
million lbs, sugar cane from 3.2 million
tons to 3.6 million tons. The total re-
corded production for 1961-62 was
worth £441 million as compared with
£4l million for 1960-61, an increased
annual dividend to the nation of 81
per cent.
The population of the City of Cairns
increased by 19.9 per cent between 1954
and 1961. This increase compared more
than favorably with that of the vast
majority of Queensland cities, - and its
percentage increase was even greater
than that of the metropolitan area of
Brisbane. Value of building permits for
the city area for 1962-63 increased by
well over 100 per cent when compared
with the previous financial year.
The local timber industry has its
problems, but hasn’t the same industry
problems throughout the Common-
wealth? Also, doesn’t the Cairns area
still produce the finest cabinet timber
in the world? The local meatworks in
the last three years has increased its
output by over 200 per cent —strange for
an area of Biblical-day graziers who have
introduced modern zebu, brahma and
other strains into their herds.
For the record one last statistical
detail. Motor registrations for the Cairns
area for the first six months of 1963
were greater than those of the rapidly ex-
panding Townsville area, and represented
an increase of 60 per cent over the
average registrations for the same period
for the preceding five years. It is
reliably estimated that for 1963 they will
be 35 per cent ahead of 1962.
It is necessary to quote these facts in
order to correct the impression of this
city and district doubtless left in the
minds of your readers by Mr Ellison’s
article.

DORIAN LE GALLIENNE
Sir,
It is a matter for regret that the article
on the late composer Dorian Le
Gallienne by your music critic Mr Ken-
neth H< nee (10/8/63) contains several
notable inaccuracies. I have no knowledge
of the source of his misinformation, but
it seems to be an example of “near
enough is good enough." In the interest
of truth and fairness, may I submit the
following facts:
(a) Mr Le Gallienne was not on the
staff of the Melbourne University Con-
servatorium at the time of his death,
nor had he been for some years.
(b) The music for Othello was writ-
ten in 1946 at the request of Peter
O’Shaughnessy who was producing the
play at the Arrow Theatre.
(c) Mr Le Gallienne joined the
“Argus” as music critic in 1950.
(d) The Symphony in E was com-
pleted while Dorian Le Gallienne was
studying with Gordon Jacob at the
Royal College of Music in London
during 1952-53. The composition of the
Sinfonietta extended over the years
1952-56, for Mr Le Gallienne wrote
two movements of it while he was with

BURMA
Sir,
Further to your recent article dealing
with the political situation in Burma
(27/7/63), your readers may be interest-
ed to learn that on the morning of Aug-
ust 9, ten leading opponents of the Revo-
lutionary Government were taken into
“protective custody”. They include U
Win (from the Union Party), U Ba
Swe and U Kyaw Nyein (from the
AFPFL) and U Law Yone (Editor of
the “Nation”).
According to my information from
Burma, the arrest of U Win and U Ba
Swe could have been a result of speeches
delivered on Martyr’s Day on July 19
when they criticised certain aspects of
Ne Win’s government. This latest de-
velopment can be viewed from two
angles. It could be the result of a
frightened Government attempting to
silence the Opposition, or a deliberate
policy on the road to a totalitarian state.
I would prefer to think that it was the
first reason.

WOOL PROMOTION
Sir,
The chairman of the Wool Board is
reported as saying, “To those of you
who reject an increased levy I throw
down a challenge to come up with an
alternative.” An alternative is that pro-
ducers stop promoting wool.
The object of promotion is to increase
demand. But, there is a considerable time
lag before wool production can respond
to an increased demand and, unlike
secondary production, an increase in
production of wool is accompanied by
an increase per unit in production cost.
Wool promotion is the legitimate job of
the manufacturer. The article he pro-
motes is a secondary product. Vigorous
promotion can be expected to increase
his production level and to reduce per
unit production cost.
It may not be significant, but carpet
wools, which have escaped producer pro-
motion, have gained a relative price
advantage of about 25 p.c. over other
wool.

“CHOICE” SPLIT
Sir,
So far as I have been able to discover,
the circumstances surrounding the forma-
tion of the Canberra Consumers’ Associa-
tion are as follows: the Canberra branch
of ACA was dissatisfied with the way
the organisation was being run and
wanted to take a more active part in it.
The central executive was unwilling to
meet the branch’s wishes. Formation of
the independent Canberra Consumers
offered a convenient way out of this
impasse.
Professor Thorp’s statement (10/8/63),
that the Canberra branch “was en-
couraged to form itself into a local
group by ACA and with ACA’s financial
help,” thus tells only part of the story.
My statement that the Canberra branch
seceded from ACA is, I submit, nearer
to the truth.

FITZROY
Sir,
As a citizen of Fitzroy for more than
half a century, and on behalf of its
professional, commercial and other citi-
zens, I take exception to the scathing
article by J. C. Kaye (6/7/63). Fitzroy
citizens had only got their second wind
after a mud-slinging from another alarm-
ist journal of Sydney.
“Slums and crime,” states Kaye in
his three-page diatribe! How many sub-
urbs has Melbourne? Why pick out Fitz-
roy for this tar and feathering? Is this
the only “vice and crime spot” in this
southern capital? What of the “toney”
suburbs south of the Yarra? Under
cover of “respectable suburbs,” is there
no “nasty element”?
Fitzroy is almost a stone’s throw away
from the heart of Melbourne city; it is
in walking distance. The city is old,
admittedly, and naturally its old-type
buildings contrast with the modernity of
other suburbs. If this suburb is the
hunting ground of “crime and prossies,”
then it is the overflow from the “respect-
able” suburbs.
Maybe Kaye forgot to research into
the archives of achievement of Fitzroy.
For example, Australia’s “silver-tongued
orator,” Sir Alfred Deakin, was born
here. This was many years ago, when
it was the decent dwelling place for the
working man and his family.
Stop mud-slinging, Bulletin writers!
Cast your eyes to your own Sydney
suburbs, such as Kings Cross or the
unsavory spots elsewhere. Be a little
more charitable and please do not prey
on time-honored suburbs in Melbourne
and other Commonwealth cities and
environs.

BRITAIN TODAY
Sir,
“Our cultural and political life should
be de-Anglified,” and yet “British poli-
tical and social institutions are the best
I know, and let us by all means protect
and safeguard them here in Australia.”
These two phrases, separated by less
than half a column in “England Made
Them” by Frank Knopfelmacher
(6/7/63) suggest a dogmatic criticism
without proposal of any real alternative.
I for one certainly construe the article
as an “anti-British tirade” since it shows
but a superficial and stereotyped know-
ledge of contemporary Britain.
For example, “the life of the English
scholarship boy and Redbrick product
is a long chain of social humiliations
and undeserved disadvantages destruc-
tive of his inner poise and character.”
In fact, the ESB is a difficult target for
social humiliation, and essays in this
regard by the public school stock are
usually successful nowadays only when
reinforced by a greater power, e.g. as
in the armed forces. To paint a picture
of such misery for the ESB is to as-
cribe to him a single-minded ambition
towards elevation of his social status.
My view as an ESB is that a person
coveting such a goal probably deserves
a bit of humiliation anyway. As for the
undeserved disadvantages, these are non-
existent for 99 per cent of the popula-
tion, and I have observed no “psycho-
logical misery” amongst ordinary people
of ordinary aims.

And that’s the way it is when you fly Qantas. Nice things happen. The smile that says ‘welcome’
(and really means it) . . . the flattering and friendly way things are anticipated for you . . . the
feeling of confidence you get when you realise that with Qantas, you fly overseas with home-travel
ease. It’s a good feeling—and for good reasons.
The fine record of dependability built up by Qantas during 42 years as the oldest-established
airline in the English-speaking world, is one. Another is the knowhow and efficiency of Qantas
people, developed through standards of training and skill unsurpassed anywhere in the world.
Thirdly, there is the excellence and superiority of the Qantas 707 V-Jet—the fastest and most
thoroughly flight-tested aircraft in commercial service.
Today, Qantas is a world-wide organisation of over 6,500 know-
ledgeable people, each contributing to the feeling of comfort and
dependability that invites comments like, “I’m not really a

LETTER FROM BRITAIN
That Was a War,
That W as
Return to 1914-18
By BERNARD BERGONZI
/”kNE of the most successful shows now
running in London is “Oh What A
Lovely War”, described on the pro-
gramme as “a musical entertainment
based on an idea of Charles Chilton”.
Originally a product of Joan Littlewood’s
Theatre Workshop at Stratford in East
London, which has given so much lively
material to the British theatre in recent
years, “Oh What A Lovely War” is now
playing to packed houses in the West
End.
The war it commemorates is the one of
1914-18, and it is basically a collection
of sketches and dances based on the
songs sentimental, comic, ribald of
World War I. The technique is original:
the actors are dressed as a troupe of
pierrots who have stepped out of a
concert party in the summer of 1914, and
they act out the succession of wartime
scenes with a minimum of props
merely a few rifles and odd pieces of
uniform. The production is given a
further dimension by the Brechtian de-
vice of having a screen at the back of
the stage on which enlarged photographs
of marching troops, the trenches, dead
soldiers are projected. And a moving
band above the stage carries bald extracts
from official communiques, emphasising
the enormous casualties and the nugatory
gains in the various advances. Despite the
fundamental grimness of its subject, “Oh
What A Lovely War” provides a highly
entertaining evening in the theatre. The
songs are memorable and well sung, and
not in any way guyed; I particularly re-
call a spirited number from the beginning
of the war called “Belgium Put the
Kibosh on the Kaiser”. There is also
some excellent miming, notably Victor
Spinetti’s performance as a bayonet in-
structor, and a brief, harrowing scene
when the male members of the cast,
riding hobby-horses and wearing bits
of pretty uniform, mime a doomed
French cavalry charge in the opening
days of the war.
Some criticism has been levelled at
“Oh What a Lovely War”. It has been
said that the facts and figures flashed on
the moving band above the stage are
inaccurate, and its portrayal of the still
controversial figure of Lord Haig—whom
it pillories as a conceited imbecile —has
caused some resentment. But it would
be unfair to think of the show simply as
a crude Leftist onslaught on politicians
and generals; one of the most telling
sketches, set in England, shows a female
pacifist orator being shouted down by a
crowd of working-class men and
women, all strongly in favor of the
war. On the whole, I think one can
assume that the large audiences attracted
by “Oh What a Lovely War” are not
very concerned with its propagandist
aspects. Those who are old enough to
remember the war, and perhaps to have
fought in it, will find a moving memorial
of some of their most vital experiences.
And for those who are younger and
these, no doubt, form the larger part of
the audiences “Oh What a Lovely
War”, as well as being admirable enter-
tainment, offers a wide range of insights
into a subject, the 1914-18 War, which
is rapidly assuming a kind of mythical
significance in our consciousness.
fpHis feeling, a fascinated mixture of
nostalgia and horror, has been well
expressed in a poem by the London-Aus-
tralian poet Peter Porter, “Somme and
Flanders”:
Their world was made of nerves and
mud.
Reading about it now shocks me
Haig
Gets transfusions of their blood,
Plum-and-apple feeds them for the
plague.
Certainly there is a great appetite
at the moment for books, films and
Television programmes about that war.
In the field of music* a distinguished
recent work was Benjamin Britten’s War
Requiem, with its setting of poems by
Wilfred Owen. The long-awaited defini-
tive edition of Owen’s poems, edited by
C. Day Lewis, has been announced for
publication, and the first section of a long
biography of Owen, written by the poet’s
brother, has just appeared. Owen was un-
doubtedly the finest poet produced by the
war (though Isaac Rosenberg approached
Owen’s quality in a handful of poems),
reflecting not only the physical horror
but the sense of a wholly new experience,
unprecedented in the history of warfare,
where traditional attitudes were no longer
appropriate. Rupert Brooke, on the other
hand, died before he could experience
the impact of a large-scale war dominated
by technology. But his “1914” sonnets,
hackneyed though they now seem, un-
doubtedly focused the dominant feeling
of most people in the opening days of the
war. If Brooke now seems a conventional
figure, the forthcoming “Life and Letters”,
by the late Christopher Hassall, may pro-
vide some grounds for a re-estimate.
The finest novel inspired by 1914-18, it
seems to me, was Ford Madox Ford’s
“Parade’s End”, describing the life and
disappointment of a rather romanticised
English gentleman called Christopher
Tietjens. This has just been reprinted
by The Bodley Head; or rather three out
of the four volumes that Ford wrote
about Tietjens have been reprinted; one
regrets the omission of the fourth volume,
“Last Post”, even though Ford did re-
gard it as something of an afterthought.
“Parade's End” contains a remarkable
understanding of what the war did to
the quality of British life, and it has some
magnificent descriptions of action in the
trenches. It has never received the at-
tention it deserves from British readers,
and one hopes that the mood of the times
will now be more sympathetic to what
it has to offer. Considered as a war
novel and it is a good deal more than
that “Parade’s End” lacks the self-
pity that disfigures Richard Aldington's
“Death of a Hero”, another novel which
will surely be reprinted before long. I
would like, too, to see new editions of
Edmund Blunden’s “Undertones of War”
and Frederic Manning’s “Her Privates
We,” both classics of life on the Western
Front. And perhaps we may see fresh
attention paid to David Jones’ brilliant
“In Parenthesis”, which combines avant-
garde literary techniques with a vivid,
day-by-day re-creation of the life of a
private soldier in France in 1915-16. First
published in 1937, this is one of the
greatest works to have come out of the
war.
At the moment, the publishers’ lists
are full of forthcoming items about the
war, and no doubt the peak will be
reached next year, the fiftieth anniver-
sary of 1914. Works are announced on the
Kaiser, and on Gallipoli, and we can


expect no fewer than three books
about Nurse Cavell. And I have heard
that John Braine’s next novel is to have
a First War setting.
The reasons for this extraordinary re-
surgence of interest are obscure and, I
suspect, rather complicated. The war of
1914-18 swept away the last remnants
of the Victorian order and brought into
being the world that we have had to in-
habit ever since. At the moment, Britain
is passing through an intensely introspec-
tive phase of national self-examination
especially since our exclusion from the
Common Market and a preoccupation
with the catastrophic trauma that marked
the beginning of the end of Britain’s
world dominance may well be part of
this self-examination. Nineteen fourteen-
eighteen is now far enough from us to
seem genuinely historical and not merely
old-fashioned; it is still well within living
memory, and yet many of the attitudes
manifested at the time seem unimaginably
remote. This combination of relative
closeness in time and extreme distance
in feeling is certainly one of the things
that makes the period fascinating. J. B.
Priestley, in his recent volume of re-
miniscences, “Margin Released”, which
contains a fine description of his own
wartime experiences, remarks that World
War I is now as remote from us as the
Napoleonic campaigns were from Tolstoy
when he began “War and Peace”. Priest-
ley adds that the subject would make a
splendid challenge for an enterprising
young novelist. It would be nice to think
that the present wave of interest —histori-
cal, literary, theatrical is preparing
the ground for another “War and Peace”.
And I hope we recognise it if it comes.

up his success with “Tea
and Sympathy”, Robert Anderson
has written a play about dinner and
sympathy. A lonely married woman and
a lonely married man meet over dinner
in a hotel in Massachusetts. Gradually
they reveal the story of the breakdown
of their respective marriages. Both are
sensitive and high-minded, he a novelist
and she a poet, and both believe in
absolute marital fidelity. The fact that
both their marriages are on the rocks,
because complete faithfulness in thought,
word and deed was not achieved by all
four partners, has not led them to ques-
tion their ideal. But neither does their
adherence to the ideal mean that the
audience is to be cheated of the adultery
which is promised by the whole atmos-
phere of the play.
As a piece of middlebrow playwriting,
apparently wrestling with serious prob-
lems while leaving them exactly as it
found them, and as an exercise in dra-
matic technique, mixing sophistication
with wild romanticism, this play man-
ages to have everything both ways in
the most ingenious manner.
Irene Mitchell’s production achieves
the right tone of well-bred, sophisticated
agony, eased by Scotch and sleeping-
pills. Norman Kaye gives an apparently
effortless performance as the husband:
sensitive, intelligent, a man who has suf-
fered but is not defeated. Julia Blake’s
performance as the wife is a little
strained, but it always seems to be very
difficult for non-American actresses to
play American women. They are a race
apart.
To run up a production of “The Wild
Duck” for a four-night season would
daunt the most experienced professional
actors and producers. Yet this was at-
tempted by the Tin Alley Players, an
amateur company, for the benefit of
Matriculation students. The effort was
heroic, but sadly mistaken. It was not
simply that “The Wild Duck” was mur-
dered: it was slowly and painfully tor-
tured and dismembered. The production
of classical plays dictated by the school
syllabus is obviously a task for pro-
fessionals.
In its programme of one-act plays,
the Union Theatre Repertory Company
is doing for Forms I and II what it
did earlier in the year for Forms 111
and IV, and what it would be good to
see it do for the Matriculation students:
presenting theatre for children with ex-
perienced actors and producers. For this
programme Wal Cherry directs a com-
pany of seven.
“No Smoke Without Fire,” “The
Bishop’s Candlesticks” and “The Oak
Settle” are typical one-act plays with
stock characters, contrived situations and
a generally musty smell. But “The Bones
of My Toe”, by Ray Mathew, set in an
Australian country town, is refreshingly
alive. It is a subtle little sketch of a boy
trying to understand the inconsistencies
of the adult world. Ray Mathew man-
ages to give a vivid impression not only
of the boy and his parents and their
relationships but also of the atmos-
phere and life of a small country town.
This production stands out from the
others because not only the play but the
acting is based on accurate observation.
Brian Hannan catches the confident but
narrow logic of the boy, while Dorothy
Bradley gives an excellent sketch of
the meddling, gossiping Mrs Dickie who
regards herself as indispensable to the
welfare of her neighbors.

TVo films, one French, one German,
trace the rake's progress of a
promiscuous woman, and both are ad-
venturous and idiosyncratic in style.
Jean-Luc Godard's “It’s My Life”
(“Vivre Sa Vie”) is by a long way the
more stimulating. A series of episodes
reveals the character of Nana, a pretty,
inefficient girl who drifts into prostitu-
tion (at first as an amateur freelance,
then with a pimp) mainly because it
seems the easiest way to avoid penury.
In Nana’s encounters with clients, fel-
low tarts and chance acquaintances,
Godard shows us the pressures which
she is not equipped to withstand, despite
her tentative gropings towards a more
positive assault on life, which is always
a little bit too much for her.
This is not an immediately easy film
to accept with its spare, elliptical style
and lack of overtly stated argument.
It is like the collection of snapshot mem-
ories that we see when looking back
over our lives trivial yet clearly re-
called incidents whose relevance is not
immediately apparent. Godard presents
the spectator with a kind of do-it-your-
self kit; he expects co-operation from
his viewer. And indeed, once the spec-
tator has attuned himself to Godard’s
allusive terseness, he will find the film
eloquent and rewarding.
Critics have disapprovingly described
the film as “disjointed,” but Godard
pays his audience the compliment of
assuming that they know that the toe
bone is connected to the foot bone.
Godard's film is far from faultless:
the deliberate avoidance of continuity
is often graceless, and he has an ob-
sessive habit of photographing the backs
of people’s heads. But “Vivre Sa Vie”
is intelligent and inventive, and Anna
Karina’s performance is beautifully
luminous and sensitive without becoming
dewily romantic.

Rolf Thiele’s “Lulu” is a stylish but
empty exercise, a sad disappointment
after the vital, febrile “Rosemarie.”
Based on plays by Wedekind which also
provided the theme for Berg’s opera
“Lulu,” this is the story of a desirable
and coldly selfish woman who debauches
and destroys all who love her, and is
herself destroyed.
There should be a witty perversity
in the treatment of this story, and Berg’s
opera has the phosphorescent beauty
of decay; but Thiele’s film version, al-
though sumptuously mounted and trick-
ily photographed, leaves no great im-
pact. Neither director nor cast show any
emotional or intellectual involvement,
and what Thiele no doubt intended as
clinical detachment is in fact a lack of
concern so complete that he can expect
no greater interest from his audience.
His use of the camera is still imaginative
and occasionally poetic, but though of
technical interest it has little bearing on
the argument or tone of the film. The
cast is expert, but Nadja Tiller (the very
embodiment of cold, passionless sex in
“Rosemarie”) fails to create much of an
impression.

TTunter’s Hill Town Hall, host to the
literary section of the recent Syd-
ney North Side Festival of Arts (which
also included art shows, concerts and
film performances), strung out its col-
ored “fairy lights” to meet the visitors.
Ladies of taste, with no ironical intent,
arranged a white urn of tall lilies on
either side of the stage, with one vase
of japonica to provide the only touch
of scarlet. Spring blossoms curved from
wall vases.
At the writers’ gatherings of the Ade-
laide Festival authors tend to behave
like undergraduates. The atmosphere is
one of genial ferocity, and arguments
are adjourned to the pub. Interruptions,
cross-talk and levity are expected. But
at Hunter’s Hill all was suitably decor-
ous. Even P. R. Stephensen, doing his
best to strike out sparks, found the
prevailing wind against him. It was no
wind out of the wasteland, for speaker
after speaker stressed that we should
now aim for “universality,” which
seemed to mean overseas sales. We must
discard any “Australian idiom.” Urban
and urbane, the “Image of Australia”
should be acceptable to the dollar
market.
Deserts and drovers were old hat.
Academics with a sufficiency of gram-
mar would henceforth carry on a litera-
ture both tasteful and intellectual.
In the midst of all this talk about
“Universality,” the winning poem by an
American poetess struck an awkward
note. The poor woman had not the
haziest idea of what Australia was really
like, and said so. She had a set of pretty
and pleasant fancies bronzed koalas
and surfing kangaroos would have ap-
peared, one felt, if she had gone on for
another verse. Instead, in her recorded
speech, she referred to Australia’s “os-
triches.” While this prize-winning poem,
for an assortment of reasons, gave fiend-
ish satisfaction to the less serious-
minded, the Poetry Society had printed
4000 copies instead of its usual 2000
copies of “Poetry,” with the prize-win-
ning poems in full. It was selling out
the issue.
Small groups of visitors came from
other States, including Mr and Mrs
Allen Aldous from Melbourne, whose
enthusiasm for Australian writing has
made it such a feature in Radio Aus-
tralia broadcasts. Silent in the audience
was the fabulous Eve Langley, poet, art-
ist and author of “The Pea Pickers,”
clad suitably in a Yorkshire moor outfit
complete with headshawl. There was
Kay Brown, from the back of Mount
Isa, where she used to fraternise with
cattle-duffers, while rearing eight child-
ren, keeping store and trying to write on
a typewriter that printed only half of
each letter.
Where the Festival scored was not
in what any speaker said but in its hap-
pening at all. It was the result of a kind
of inspired collective goodwill, a wil-
lingness to play it off the cuff, make
shift and experiment, so that those who
came as unwilling conscripts, stayed to
work with enthusiasm.

lan Fairweather. Recently at Mac-
quarie Galleries, Sydney.
T>ecent years have provided few
annual events as interesting as lan
Fairweather’s one-man shows. At the
very least we are treated to some new
direction, neither erratic nor radical, but
capable of quickening the pulse of
the most jaded of his admirers. Part
of this appeal comes from an awareness
of Fairweather’s commendable indepen-
dence of spirit, detachment from the
hurly burly of any art centre and high
artistic integrity. He fills a treasured
role Australians would like to think all
their major artists were capable of. In a
real sense most artists are cultural
hermits; Fairweather underlines this fact
by assuming the role of a social one.
What we see then of his painting is
what he would consider the essential
Fairweather and this after all is why we
look behind the glamor of myth,
anecdote or gossip which might surround
his name. To do so is sufficient reward.
A few artists manage to receive second
wind in their old age, a second youth
which caps a fruitful career with a
mature vigor. Fairweathei is such an
artist. His rapid, sure, virtuoso calli-
graphy seems deceptively easy, and it is
for him after decades of progressive
development. Refreshing to see in the
face of this is an unevenness of achieve-
ment in this latest show where smaller
works have proportionally less and the
bigger proportionally greater mastery, as
if the wider challenge elicited the deepest
response. The mystique here is commit-
ted to a basic humanism, the technique
'to an involved fusion of Eastern and
Western attitudes.

Innocent or Guilty?
The agony of Sacco and Vanzetti
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Tragedy in Dedham: The Story of the
Sacco-Vanzetti Case. Francis Rus-
sell. Longmans. 525. 6d.
At midnight on August 22, 1927, two
Italian radicals named Nicola Sacco
and Bartolomeo Vanzetti were electro-
cuted in the State Prison of Massachu-
setts. Next morning the “Boston Herald”,
employing a variegated array of meta-
phors, breathed an editorial sigh of
relief that the whole nasty business had
ended: “The time for all discussion is
over. The chapter is closed. The die is
cast. The arrow has flown. Now let us
go forward to the duties and responsi-
bilities of the common day with a re-
newed determination to maintain our
present system of government and our
existing social order”.
The “Herald” spoke not only for the
Babbitts of Beacon Hill but for millions
of other decent, patriotic Americans who
had come to believe that the existence of
men like Sacco and Vanzetti really did
imperil the Constitution laid down by the
Founding Fathers. But, as they turned
from the screaming headlines announ-
cing the execution, newspaper readers
found assurance that the “existing social
order” stood indeed unchanged. On Wall
Street the Big Bull Market was roaring
on. Beauty Queens were parading at
Miami Beach. Guns blazed and booze
flowed in the alleys of Chicago. Mean-
while, in other parts of the world, police
swept up the shattered glass in front of
American embassies and ambulances col-
lected the wounded left after riots in the
streets of Paris, Berlin, Geneva and
Buenos Aires.
However, pace the “Boston Herald”,
the Sacco and Vanzetti chapter has never
been finally closed. Echoes of the his-
toric case still reverberate round the
United States. Books and magazine
articles, mostly thoroughly partisan in
character, are still written to prove either
that Sacco and Vanzetti were cold-blood-
ed killers who got their just deserts or
else that they were victims of a par-
ticularly revolting miscarriage of justice.
Only three years ago the State legisla-
ture of Massachusetts appointed a special
committee to consider a proposal for a
posthumous pardon for the dead men.
“Sacco and Vanzetti had about as much
chance of getting a pardon from that
committee as Benedict Arnold,” the
author of “Tragedy in Dedham” com-
ments grimly. “The gum-chewing faces
behind the oak desks in the State
House’s Gardner Auditorium were im-
placable”. Not one of the committeemen
was likely to risk his political skin by
raking over old scandals that involved
such Olympians as the President of Har-
vard and the judges of the Supreme Court
of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
Not long after the committee turned
down the pardon proposal I was enter-
tained at the San Francisco home of a
veteran and, I thought, intelligent news-
paperman who was working in Boston
at the time of the execution. The talk
. somehow got round to the Dreyfus Affair
and I ventured the remark that the Sacco-
Vanzetti Case was an interesting parallel.
My host fixed me with a cold stare.
“Sacco and Vanzetti were a couple of
goddam Reds”, he said. “They got a fair
trial. All that agitation was just a gigantic
Communist propaganda stunt!” He
obviously had no more doubts about the
subject than did Judge Webster Thayer
of Massachusetts 30 years before. “Did
you see what I did to those anarchist
bastards the other day?”, Judge Thayer
said complacently to a legal colleague as
they strolled under the elms of Dart-
mouth College after Thayer had rejected
one of the many applications for a new
trial on behalf of Sacco and Vanzetti.
HThe beginnings were commonplace
A enough. On April 15, 1920, a carload
of bandits drove into the small Massa-
chusetts town of South Braintree, shot
and killed two payroll guards in the street
and made off with 16,000 dollars of a
shoe company’s wages. On May 5, Sacco
and Vanzetti were arrested in Brockton,
a few miles away. The news rated a few
paragraphs on the inside pages of the
Boston newspapers but, by the time the
two men were brought to trial for mur-
der a year later, much had happened.
It transpired that Nicola Sacco, the boot
factory worker, and Bartolomeo Vanzetti,
the poor fish pedlar, were anarchists
and well-known figures in various radi-
cal associations of Italian immigrants.
In other times the connection between
philosophic anarchism and payroll rob-
bery might have been less apparent, but
Americans in 1920 were in no mood to
draw fine distinctions. The Red Scare
was in full swing. Five days after Sacco
and Vanzetti were indicted, a bomb
wrecked the front of that citadel of
capitalism, the J. P. Morgan offices in
New York. Explosions in other cities
kept the nation in a ferment of alarm.
Anarchists were blamed, probably right-
ly, for the outrages. By the time Sacco
and Vanzetti appeared in the courtroom
at Dedham in May, 1921, the dice were
heavily loaded against them.
For six sweltering summer weeks the
trial dragged on, while Judge Thayer
bickered rancorously with the chief de-
fence counsel, Fred Moore (who was not
only a notorious radical sympathiser but
a vulgar Californian as well), and the
bemused jury listened to a welter of con-
tradictory evidence about identification,
ballistics and less pertinent matters. In
the end Sacco and Vanzetti were found
guilty. Reading Russell’s detailed account
of the trial proceedings, one can only
agree with the journalistic observer who
said he would not hang a dog on the
evidence as it was presented at Dedham.
It was only after the trial that the
American public became conscious that
a Sacco-Vanzetti Case existed. From a
bare little Boston office a Defence Com-
mittee, backed by an odd assortment of
immigrant anarchists, liberals and Boston
intellectuals, began pouring out propa-
ganda to show that the Italians had been
victimised because of their nonconfor-
mist political beliefs. Left-wing parties
abroad took up the cry and the first rash
of anti-American demonstrations broke
out in the capitals of Europe. The two
shabby figures in a Massachusetts gaol
had become world news. Eventually they
were to become almost dehumanised
symbols. There is something rather hor-
rifying in the procession of events that
followed. And finally the execution has
all the atmosphere of a ritual slaying, as
though the State needed the deaths of
Sacco and Vanzetti to justify its very
foundations of justice and morality.
Nevertheless the struggle was long
and unremitting. Only in America are the
legal manoeuvres possible by which the
defenders of Sacco and Vanzetti, in one
appeal after another, kept the electric
chair at bay for six years. Meanwhile a
bitter controversy divided the country,
involving such diverse figures as Judge
Felix Frankfurter, Dorothy Parker and
lariat-looping comedian Will Rogers. The
Sacco-Vanzetti Case became a shibboleth,
dividing the liberals (“cranks”, “long-
hairs”, “parlor pinks”) from conserva-
tives (“capitalist stooges”, “Boston cod-
fish”, “suburban hill-billies”). A rival
Communist-led Defence Committee el-
bowed out the original Boston organisa-
tion and cried for mass revolutionary ac-
tion with the effect of scaring many
worried Americans into the opposite
camp.
It is one of the many merits of Russell’s


book that he is deeply interested in
Sacco and Vanzetti as individuals rather
than symbols. Their letters written in
prison, from which he prints many ex-
tracts, reveal a kind of innocent nobility
that makes it almost impossible to believe
they were cold-blooded robbers and mur-
derers. While he was awaiting the out-
come of the Lowell Committee’s delibera-
tions, his last hope of reprieve, Van-
zetti told one interviewer: “If it had
not been for this thing I might have
lived out my life talking at street corners
to scorning men. I might have died un-
marked, unknown, a failure. Now we
are not a failure. This is our career and
our triumph. Never in our full life can
we hope to do such work for tolerance,
for justice, for man’s understanding of
man, as now we do by an accident”. An
accident! Is it credible that, with death
staring him in the face, a guilty man
would have referred to his fate in such
terms?
Books will no doubt continue to be
written about the Sacco-Vanzetti Case,
but “Tragedy in Dedham” is certainly
the most lucid and comprehensive ac-
count yet to appear in print. Russell adds
the result of his own investigations to
the mass of material accumulated since
1927 and his conclusion is worthy of
respect. He believes that Sacco might pos-
sibly have been one of the men in the
car at South Braintree, but that Van-
zetti almost certainly was not. The
tragedy is that, somewhere in the great
upheaval of bitterness and controversy
between 1920 and 1927, the simple ques-
tion of their guilt or innocence seemed to
disappear.

llflß Goodheart’s “The Utopian Vision
of D. H. Lawrence” is an important
book. In all the years of discussion of
Lawrence’s work, as novelist, poet,
thinker, no one before seems to have
related his ideas to the context of Euro-
pean intellectual history, not merely to
an English literary tradition. Mr Good-
heart now does so, administering a
gentle rebuke to Dr Leavis’s insularity,
and placing Lawrence beside Blake,
Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Rilke par-
ticularly the first and third of these, who
have, as Mr Goodheart points out, a
comparable relation to orthodox Christi-
anity. He believes that Lawrence is really
concerned about how things should be,
rather than how they are (hence the
present work’s title). He acknowledges
the frequent formal contradictions from
one work to another of many of Law-
rence’s statements, but believes this due
to “the dialectical character of Law-
rence’s imagination”; and he attempts
throughout his book “to understand
these oppositions as the expression of a
single, coherent revolutionary imagina-
tion.”
This is an interesting aim, and the
results in Mr Goodheart’s hands are in-
teresting both in themselves and in
their implications. What he achieves
above all is an invaluable clarification
of the nature of Lawrence’s thinking,
and a firm statement of the essential
positions which it leads him to. If Mr
Goodheart is right (and his supporting
evidence is comprehensive and telling),
then Lawrence’s thought is radically and
violently opposed to any traditional hu-
manism, Christian, non-Christian, or anti-
Christian. I think that Mr Goodheart
makes out his case, and I think he has
done us all a great service by setting
out so clearly and firmly the essential
character in philosophical terms, of what
we are affirming or opposing in respond-
ing to the general cast of Lawrence’s
writing.
Mr Semmler’s volume collects essays
appearing in the journals over some
years, and they stand up pretty well to
the harsh test of book form. Two-thirds
of its length is devoted to James Joyce,
and two-thirds of that to a history of
the fortunes of Joyce’s work in Aus-
tralia an interesting survey which
extends to the social and political issues
of official censorship and the general
reception here of this key-figure of our
time; Mr Semmler quotes the newspaper
comments as well as the literary jour-
nals, Norman Lindsay (who denounced
“Ulysses” as a work of “disgust”) as
well as Professor Goldberg. The result
is an interesting piece of cultural-social
history, which gains concision and clarity
from its focus on a limited subject-mat-
ter, which, however, it can treat very
comprehensively. This is a kind and
method of study that might be taken up
and applied to other major twentieth-
century figures Lawrence for in-
stance.
The other Joyce essays are exegetic
and biographical. Two brief ones seem
to me to provide valuable insights into
the real nature of Joyce’s achievement,
and their titles speak for themselves
“Portrait of the Artist as a Humorist,”
“Radio and James Joyce,” forcefully
putting forward Joyce’s comic merits
and his power as a master of spoken
language.
Three general essays are less happy,
and again their titles summarise their
trend: “The Plight of the Uncanny Man
Notes on Mass Culture and Com-
munications, with some reference to
Australia”; “The Cultures of Australia”;
“Saeva Indignatio Television Style”.
Mr Semmler’s stance here is typical of
the somewhat frightening illiberality dis-
played by many intellectuals confronted
with the less worthy manifestations of
a commercial mass-culture. Admittedly
there is much to deplore, but the present
stage of things is a passing one the
uncomfortable maturation of universal
primary education; we have yet to see
the results of universal secondary train-
ing, far less the incalculable effects of
vastly extended tertiary teaching and
adult education. Mr Semmler under-
estimates, anyway, the resilience of
popular culture: people may watch all
that kitsch stuff, but they’re not neces-
sarily taken in or hopelessly depraved
by it; and the enormous sales of “qual-
ity” paperbacks means something.
R. D. Fitzgerald’s “The Elements of
Poetry,” in a disastrously shoddy format,
gives us three essays. One is an uneasy
shot at erecting poetry into a para-
religion or para-science, capable of re-
placing either as an approach to reality.
A second puts forward a surely too
high view of Douglas Stewart’s stature,
but has many particular insights of
value. The third is much the best, mak-
ing a good stand on poetry as a matter
of meaningful statement, though marred
by Mr Fitzgerald’s pushing a theory of
motif as distinct from and more fun-
damental than “theme.”

Generation
on Trial
The Middle of the Journey. Lionel
Trilling. Penguin. 7s. 6d.
11/hen this novel first came out 15 years
’’ ago it was more or less compulsory
reading as a key to the Hiss-Chambers
Case —a key, as it were, to one of the
keys to the age. Trilling was supposed to
have used his old student friend, Whit-
taker Chambers, as the model for Gifford
Maxim (the book’s ex-Communist es-
pionage organiser who is now fearful of
being murdered by the Party and is
turning to religion in disgust with the
triviality of the New Deal intellectuals)
and Alger and Priscilla Hiss were suppos-
ed to be the models for Maxim’s foils,
the stalinoid liberals, Arthur and Nancy
Croom. All this gave the book a special
immediacy but it was also misleading
since the book aimed at far more than
backgrounding Communist espionage; it
purported to be a moral critique of the
whole range of the Freud and Marx-
educated leftists, a sort of summary of
those brilliant demolitions of the new
left-liberal orthodoxy in Trilling’s maga-


zine “Partisan Review” during its best
period just after the war.
It was an exciting book for me back
in 1948. The left-liberal view of life,
with all its intellectual sordidness, its
double-think morals and manners, was
just becoming the orthodoxy here, but
Australian writers, in their passion for
writing about anything but Australian
realities, were still relentlessly rehashing
the worn-out themes of 1890-1930
“naturalism” or writing pleasant little
poems about birds. It seemed to me then
that this American book was the first
novel I had read that told me something
fresh about contemporary Australia. I
think I must have read it about a dozen
times, taking copious notes, and for years
afterwards I kept hearing echoes of it
in people’s conversation on anything
from love and death to childbearing,
gardening and Communism.
Perhaps it is always the bad books that
influence one most in this way, but it is
disconcerting to reread “The Middle of
the Journey” now and see how unsatis-
factory it is as a novel. The theme
responsibility for evil is as clearly
established as one would expect from a
leading academic literary critic, but the
style is too pedagogical and the characters
are too often over-intellectualised card-
board figures: the secret-stalinist wife of
the w'eak, left-conformist husband who
imagines himself constantly in danger of
persecution by the security services: the
1920's arty Lawrencian bohemian chat-
ting about Spengler; the old-fashioned
agnostic liberal fascinated by the ex-
Communist’s religious conversion; the
godless parson admiring “the Great Soviet
Experiment"; the bum cynically exploit-
ing the leftists’ romantic view of him
as a true proletarian; the passionate ex-
Communist, a product of the bohemian
1920’s “Second Period” Communism,
fighting for the soul of his sceptical
friend; and the genuine liberal, the central
figure, recovering from a nearly fatal
illness and redefining himself neither in
terms of the Crooms’ fellow-travelling
nor Maxim’s sin-obsessed religiosity—-
these characters and others are all excel-
lently conceived, but too often they speak
their lines only to illustrate formally
Trilling’s intellectual insight rather than
ever come to life as fully imagined crea-
tions.
One has only to compare the mag-
nificence of Whittaker Chambers’ auto-
biography “Witness” with some of the
philosophical speeches of Gifford Maxim
in this novel and Maxim is a fascinat-
ing creation to see how ill-equipped
Trilling is to do full justice to the theme
of this sort of ex-Communist. Trilling’s
talents, so adequate for his major short-
stories such as “Of This Time, Of This
Place”, were obviously inadequate for a
full-scale novel; and it seems right that
he has never attempted another.
The book, however, does have one
really masterly section which will always
remain a classic reference in fiction about
intellectuals and which shows Trilling
as a moralist of a very rare quality
the chapters describing and dissecting the
leftists’ disgust with and hostility to the
Communist who defects and tells the
truth about his former Party and its
exploitation of their illusions. This has
never been done better. For a counter-
part I can only think of Edmund Gosse’s
account in “Father and Son” of how
science-minded Christians reacted to
Darwin’s discoveries. For this alone the
book remains compulsory reading.

novelist who explores the human
emotions can do it with Heming-
way's axe, Faulkner's adze, a New Yorker
scalpel, Miss Compton Burnett's knitting
needles, or any tool between. It can even
be done with mirrors, as Denton Welch
has shown. The three works named above
are emotional, and Gael Mayo's appealed
to me most.
Miss Mayo was born in Australia but
left here aged one to live in America,
England, France and Spain. She is a
painter with two novels to her credit, or
the other way around. In the latest work
she invades Sagan territory with a story
of young women and older men and
lots of l'amour. She is a much better
writer than Sagan, and if there is any
justice she should make a mint of money
too.
Probably this will not happen. The
title, dust jacket with nude and cat, and
understated flyleaf blurb are too likely to
evoke an uh-huh reaction among people
who are looking for a book of quality
to read. “Nobody’s Nothing” is such a
book. Its blurb ends with, “has made a
most revealing search into the human
heart”, and for once that is not a pub-
lisher’s cliche.
The “nobody’s nothing” is at first Liza,
an English born painter in Paris, called
“the cat girl” because she mixes yet re-
mains apart, until the day she meets an
impoverished man with a ruined castle
and marriage. Liza's love falters only
once, when she sacrifices her baby and
“There was hate, now and for ever.”
But her man Louis found the right words
at one of those moments which can be
the end or a new beginning, and “she
considered him: finally she put out her
hand: he took it . . . and looked at her
strange, broken little face that smiled and
cried at the same time.”
Liza was more fortunate than the
novel's final nobody's nothing, Veronica,
French-American, whose first man Colin
always failed to recognise such crucial
moments, and whose second man Pio
was a Spaniard with rigid ideas which
constricted and finally killed their asso-
ciation.
These bare bones, as usual, tell you
nothing. They fail to indicate that Gael
Mayo is more than a good craftsman,
more than a talented story teller, that
she has the makings of a front-rank
novelist.
You can read the book as a story.
Or as an examination of modern woman
failing to find a man who can com-
promise satisfactorily between freedom
and imprisonment for her. Or as a study
of French and Spanish attitudes. It has
many levels. The style is broad and
powerful:
“Louis was now green, the color of
his disgust. Liza listened and grasped
nothing, it was a type of madness that
was beyond her; these lawyers’ laws made
no sense at all. She rocked in her chair,
feeling like Buddha listening to a radio
programme of the Western world.”
Now read this for contrast: “Flora
thought quickly. She was a little taken
aback by his prompt acceptance. Had she
been impulsive and silly? What would
Trevor think? Would he be pleased?
Aloud she said, ‘Yes, that will be fine’.”
That is the late Denton Welch in one
of the stories in Jocelyn Brooke’s selec-
tion from his published works. Welch
mostly wrote in the first person, as
though with total recall of every incident
he saw and his reactions to it, achieving
a pointillist effect of acts and facts, a
writing with affectation but no affection.
It left me as cold as Gael Mayo's love for
all human beings left me feeling warm.
It might be fairer to compare Welch’s
“I” with Saul Bellow's first person dangler
between the civilian and army worlds of
1942. They are contemporaries. One
sees the world only through himself, the
other himself through the world. One
records trivialities as though they are im-
portant, the other for what they are to
him, part of a non-existence: “And I rose
rather unsteadily from the rocker, feeling
that there was an element of treason to
common sense in the very objects of
common sense.”
Welch is praised for “sureness of
touch . . . subtlety and simplicity” and
no less than Dame Edith once wrote
that “he never fumbles”. That may be
only because he is not carrying the ball
much of the time, while Bellow's “I” and
Gael Mayo's people always have it in
their hands, even though they are run-
ning nowhere.

Union
The African Patriots. Mary Benson.
Faber and Faber. 595. 3d.
'[VfARY Benson’s book traces with
sympathetic care the history of the
African National Congress from its
foundation in 1912 to its banning in
April, 1960, and goes on to deal with
the subsequent activities of its leaders. As
she herself admits, it is a committed
book, but hers is not a commitment in
any narrow sense, to one political party
or its policies. What emerges most strik-
ingly is the commitment of the ANC to
the ideals of human dignity and common
humanity, a commitment shared by the
author. For this, there need be no
apology.
From the African point of view, the
Union of South Africa, established in
1910, was a disaster. More clearsighted
than the British Government, politically
conscious Africans realized that the
handing over of all political power to the
white minority, itself dominated by the
Afrikaners, with their inflexible attitude
to racial questions, could only end in
oppression and conflict. In 1912, more
than thirty years before similar organisa-
tions were founded in Nigeria, the Gold
Coast and Kenya, the ANC declared its
aim of uniting the African tribes, and
defending their rights. It is a fair measure
of the ruthlessness with which all aspira-
tions for African political advancement
have been suppressed, that now, fifty
years later, the organisations in Kenya,
Nigeria and Ghana have won indepen-
dence for their countries, their founders
are respected Ministers of State, whereas,
in South Africa, every African political
organisation is banned, the leaders
silenced, exiled or imprisoned.
Perhaps the most surprising point that
the book makes, for readers not very
familiar with pre-war South African
politics, is that the present Nationalist
Government is by no means unique in
its attitude to the non-whites. The history
of the African struggle for basic human
rights is a sorry tale of the suppression
by violence of even the most moderate
demands. The shooting at Sharpeville in
1960, which caught the attention of the
world, was only one incident in a series
of clashes between armed police and un-
armed demonstrators, nor was it the
worst. Under the Smuts Government, over
100 non-whites were killed by bombing
from the air, after a refusal to pay what
they regarded as an excessive dog tax,
and as far back as 1922, at Bulhoek, 163
Africans had died when the police had
opened fire on a large gathering. Miss
Benson’s history, carefully documented,
drives one to the conclusion that every
South African Government since Union
has met African attempts at negotiation,
at best with indifference and contempt,
at worst with hostility and violence.
Pew political movements, under equal
provocation, can have as steadfastly
refused to meet narrowness and violence
with its own weapons. To found an exclu-
sive African Nationalism, as exclusive as
Afrikaner Nationalism, is a temptation
that the ANC has recognised but reject-
ed, and the ANC has proved its sincerity
by its willingness to co-operate with men
of goodwill of all races.
The latter part of the story is domi-
nated by the figure of Chief Albert
Luthuli. Nobel prize-winner, and Presi-
dent-General of the ANC from 1953 to
the time of its banning. The record of
the sanity, and of the suffering and
sacrifice of men like Luthuli, Nelson
Mandela. Walter Sizulu and other leaders,
of their refusal to swing Congress policy
away from non-violence, even in the face
of extreme provocation, is the most mov-
ing thing about this book. The closing
chapters, with their account of these
dignified, high-principled and courageous
men goin<? one by one into banishment,
exile, or imprisonment, from which they
now need never be released, are heart-
breaking. The whole spirit of the Con-
gress movement is suggested by Man-
dela's words on receiving his sentence of
five years’ imprisonment: “If I had my
time over I would do the same again,
as would any man who dares call him-
self a man.”
One could not imagine a more telling
rebuttal of the typical white South
African attitude, that Africans are
irresponsible savages, than that provided
by this moving and clearly-written book.
DERICK MARSH
Suspense
The Collection and The Lover. Harold
Pinter. Methuen. 20s. 9d.
TTlhe typical situation in Pinter’s early
A plays is two people in a room. Out-
side the door is menace. They are the
anonymous “little” people of the modern
industrial world: urban, uprooted, soli-
tary. They live in rented rooms or board-
ing houses, or, like the old tramp in
“The Caretaker”, they are “of no fixed
address”. Inside the room, which is the
only place they feel safe, the conversation
is always in the same style. It is the
speech of those who find communication
difficult: the under-educated, the nervous.
It is evasive, repetitive, wary, full of
pauses. Either half their attention is on
the door, listening for the knock, or else
they are listening to the threat in the
voice of the other person, scanning the
pauses for a malign intention.
In these plays the suspense and feel-
ing of dread were created cleverly and
economically by means of the terse,
strained dialogue. The characters from
the submerged mass stunted, inarticu-
late, fearful were closely observed and
realistically presented. But the resolution
of the plays seemed crudely melodra-
matic, and the unidentified powers out-
side the door seemed to be bogymen,
partly horrible and partly ludicrous.
In “The Caretaker”, his best play to
date, Pinter brought the menace in from
outside the door. There is still suspense
and a threat of violence throughout the
play, but there is nothing supernatural
or bogy-like about it: the danger lies in
the characters themselves. Some of the
suspense is simply whipped-up, but
Davies the tramp is so well observed that
the play survives this.
But in “The Collection” and “The
Lover” Pinter’s technique and his subject-
matter seem completely unsuited to each
other. Both plays are about middle-class
adultery: a new subject and a new social
class for Pinter. Both plays are exercises
in suspense, but the suspense seems to
have no proper connection with the
sexual theme.
“The Collection” opens with a man in
a telephone box asking to speak to “Bill”.
He refuses to give his name. It is 4 a.m.
Immediately a Hitchcock atmosphere has
been established. We expect at least one
murder to follow, but instead the husband
broods over his wife’s supposed adultery
amid conflicting stories from the supposed
lover, and finally gets as far as throwing
a cheese knife at him. Although the
suspense is sustained throughout the play,
in the end the whole thing just fizzles out
and one is left wondering what it was all
for. No light is cast on the subject of
adultery, and there is no sign of anyone
feeling any love, or even lust, for any-
one else.
In “The Lover”, a play written for
television, the husband and wife have
built up an elaborate system of pretence,
the husband impersonating a lover and
the wife a mistress, in order to pep up
their sexual life without resort to any
outside aid. No doubt it is the logical
development for the isolated suburban
couple in an atomised society, and John
Osborne uses a remarkably similar idea
in one of his “Plays for England”. But,
whereas Osborne, writing with his usual
verbal exuberance, treats the idea as
high comedy, Pinter once again builds
up suspense. The result is to make sexual
life in commuter country seem chillingly
perverse.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Awaiting That Increased Spending
Employment Patterns will be Watched More Closely
Australian businessmen could take heart from the more
favorable business statistics which appeared in August.
These encouraging signs covered a fall in unemployment
in July, increased capital expenditure in private industry in the
June quarter and the stimulus to housing likely to arise from
the Commonwealth Government’s amendments to savings
banks’ lending capacity for home loans. Also the motor vehicle
industry continued to report solid sales in July while the decks
were cleared for new models.
Increased capital expenditure by Australian private enter-
prise in the June quarter of 1963 undoubtedly was influenced
to some extent by the buoyant motor trade. Most of the statis-
tics published were predictably in line with the upward trend
which had been developing for some months.
But businessmen with heavy stocks on the shelves and with
factories running well below capacity now want to see if the
“expansion” plans in the Budget will be translated into in-
creased consumer spending. The period before Christmas nor-
mally is buoyant. And company results now appearing usually
are the best of the crop. The bad news invariably is delayed.
Looking a little farther ahead to January and February, the
question of projected unemployment in 1964 looms large. A
boost in migration means more jobs to be found, and the hang-
over from this year’s failure to place school leavers in jobs
may linger stubbornly. A situation not generally calculated in
official figures is that many teenagers were unable to obtain
jobs this year and went back to school. Therefore they did not
appear as statistics in the unemployment total.
TI/lany parents subsidised this hidden pool of unemployment
by paying for an extra year at school. Fifth-year students
in Australian high schools who have warmed the benches for
two consecutive years are likely to be out looking for jobs
in 1964, whether they pass or fail in their increasingly difficult
Leaving Certificate examination. Parental subsidisers will not
be anxious to keep their offspring in fifth-year suspension for
a third consecutive year.
Therefore the forecasts in many quarters of an unemploy-
ment figure of around 110,000 or more next January could be
justified, despite an increase in job offerings at that time. After
all, the population is up around the 11 million mark now and
a greater volume of people require jobs than in the boom year
of 1960.
Capital expenditure in industry over the past five years also
has brought increased efficiency in production techniques,
including greater productive capacity. Without a corresponding
increase in consumer demand, the outlet for that higher rate
of production must involve increased exports. Otherwise pro-
duction must be choked back. Unfortunately, as everyone
knows, cheap and efficient production relies on maximum use
of machinery, long runs and (usually) three-shift employment.
In planning future operations, therefore, the factory owners
must assess what they are likely to sell next year. That juicy,
teenage market of heavy spenders becomes less attractive when
there are insufficient jobs to go around. So the employment
patterns will be watched even more closely in the future.
More Flexible
Interest Rates
T>ising prices for Commonwealth Bonds in 1962-63 evi-
% dently gave some nice capital profits to the nine accredited
dealers in Australia’s relatively young short term money mar-
ket, judged on the latest results of Discount Corporation of
Australia Ltd.
The short term bonds they held (of three years or less) may
have provided capital profits when sold, but the short term
money market dealers rely on interest for their bread and
butter. They accept short term deposit money from the public
in amounts of not less than £25,000 and lodge these funds
(as required by the Reserve Bank) in short term bonds.
The difference between the interest they pay to the public
and the interest they receive on the bonds represents their
profit. Discount Corporation’s profit fell from £166,411 to
£109,190 after a much higher tax provision, because the
major part of its profit came from capital gains on bonds
purchased in the market when prices were low. But interest
margins are difficult to maintain under such circumstances.
If interest rates on bonds reverse their recent trend,
dealers now paying relatively high prices for bonds will incur
some capital losses when they are obliged to sell securities.
But, of course, they will make larger profits on their interest
margins.
iXN the assumption that what goes up must come down, Dis-
count Corporation (two-thirds owned by AMP Society and
one-third by Sydney sharebroking firm Horden Utz & Bode),
has altered its method of valueing Commonwealth Government
securities and is retaining most of its profit in anticipation of
fluctuations in bond prices.
Dr Coombs, Governor of the Reserve Bank, who led the
way on reduced interest rates earlier this year, also admits
that interest rate flexibility is needed (as proved by the more
mature money markets overseas where alterations in Bank
rate set the pattern).
So, at some future time a different situation could require
an increase in rates. Not only the money market but the share
market should take note of Dr Coombs’ plea for flexibility of
interest rates, plus the argument from the Reserve Bank that
interest rate adjustments are less painful than “wider and
more restrictive policy measures.”
If Australia is moving towards the accepted overseas method
of flexible interest rates, the much-criticised Stop-Go economic
pattern could be overshadowed by the less obvious and more
sophisticated Turn-on-Turn-off system applied through the
Central banking system.


The Great Debate On
Capital Inflow
Oarliament, the public and a visiting American professor
keep the controversy on overseas investment in Australia
bubbling over. Not much ground for firm policy emerges from
these periodical and often partisan outbursts.
The Federal Government’s economic inquiry should set
to and examine the issues thoroughly, detachedly and with
urgency.
One paragraph in the Reserve Bank’s latest annual report
states the general situation with succinctness and noticeable
clarity. It begins by mentioning the obvious dependence of the
balance of payments on capital inflow, admitting also the
manifest benefits gained from the additional resources and
improvement of technical competence.
Those advantageous elements bring considerable costs in
their train: “the actual growth
of remittances abroad of earn-
ings on overseas capital invest-
ed and the possibility of dislo-
cation of our external equili-
brium should capital inflow fall
away sharply.”
All that sounds common-
place, yet the implications must
never be neglected. Dr Coombs,
however, does not leave the
matter there, but incorporates
a stern and necessary doctrine
of self-help.
“One response to the con-
siderations,” he preaches, “ap-
propriate also on other grounds,
is a greater effort to increase
our own skills in production
and management so as to help
expand exports, replace imports
competitively and reduce our
technological dependence on
others. Further ... we can
guard against unfavorable
changes in the assessment of
our economic potential by ensuring a sound and growing
domestic economy.”
JgjvERY proposition there calls for pondering and subsequent
action by businessmen and policymakers alike. Techno-
logical dependence” can bear great emphasis. For all its recent
development, Australian industry has not furnished much evi-
dence of native inventiveness.
Dr Coombs’ exposition should be placed in the context
of the parliamentary debate, which expressed a fair measure
of concern at possible injury to the Australian economy,
though little sense of positive correction.
Direct legislation to control overseas investment was sug-
gested by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Calwell). He would
aim at an Australian equity in every local industry and get rid
of export restrictions imposed on Australian subsidiaries of
overseas companies.
The Government, rightly, denied any-crisis, reiterating the
country’s need for the resources and skills deriving from the
importation of capital.
Meanwhile an outsider, Stanford (USA) Professor John
Ewing, urges the rigid protection of 49 p.c. Australian capital
to 51 p.c. foreign investment and drew attention to the prob-
lems raised by foreign management.
It may be doubted whether some of the larger foreign com-
panies would view such high equity percentages with aplomb
Pigures for Australian trade with Brunei were included with
North Borneo and Sarawak until 1961-62.
and also whether Australia could financially aim to achieve
such levels in some existing toreign-controlled enterprises.
A trend towards establishing a growing share of Australian
participation can surely be gradually established by Govern-
ment discussion with overseas interests. Most crucially, the
direction of overseas investment, the resources it may ulti-
mately control, should be held in mind. There’s now no room
for haphazard capital inflow.
CEDA Research Looks
Towards Asia
two years must elapse before the Committee for Eco-
nomic Development of Australia’s research project on
South-East Asian trade and aid can be brought to a finish.
As mentioned in The Bulletin of August 10, the job is con-
sidered important enough to
warrant a 75,000 dollar grant
from the Ford Foundation.
Firm policy recommenda-
tions were aimed at, the chair-
man of CEDA’s executive com-
mittee (Sir Douglas Copland)
explained in Sydney last week.
The programme specifically
covers trade relations and
foreign aid efforts throughout all
South-East Asia, and will also
examine the “prospects for
multilateral trade and the role
of aid agencies” like the Col-
ombo Plan.
A “national policy state-
ment”, together with the com-
pleted study, should see the
light after an international con-
ference held in Australia. The
other main conferees are to
be research partners US Com-
mittee for Economic Develop-
ment and Keizai Doyukai, the
parallel Japanese organisation.
CEDA also intends to invite the New Zealand Institute
of Economic Research, the Private Planning Association of
Canada and “a representative Indian group.”
actual scheme of research will follow CEDA’s usual
method fairly closely. A number of businessmen and aca-
demics from the board of trustees, “interested in South-East
Asian affairs, ’ accept responsibility for overall supervision
and control, approving the research plan and budget. A work-
ing sub-committee directs day-to-day activities.
The grant, however, allows the decided advantage of ap-
pointing two full-time research fellows, who will work at
universities, conduct interviews and visit selected crucial
Asian countries. Such an addition augments normal part-time
procedures.
In the extremely volatile and critical Asian area national
policies do not stay on ice while researchers collect data and
ponder. CEDA’s predominantly businessman slant no doubt
makes it a trifle shy of direct Government contacts.
With the stakes at issue in this particular project, it may
be hoped that these associations will not be avoided and that
occasional interim publication makes an attempt to influence
policy on the wing.


The Case Against A
Restrictive Trade Bill
No.5- A Visiting Professor’s Ideology
By ROGER RANDERSON
A misleading booklet, which the
Attorney-General has now issued,
confirms much that has already
been stated in opposition to a grandiose
and dangerous scheme, and it can appro-
priately be considered at the present
stage of our discussion.
The bibliography given has one use in
showing some at least of the sources
from which Sir Garfield Barwick has
taken information and inspiration.
Now we know why the scheme is “out
of touch with reality and pays little heed
to the practical requirements of the busi-
ness world,” as stated by Mr Dunlop on
behalf of the NSW Council of the In-
stitute of Directors.
But there are wider implications in the
Attorney-General’s choice of non-official
advisers.
Sir Garfield, through the booklet, re-
veals his own necessarily limited ex-
perience of the problems of the vast and
ever-changing world of business, and the
obdurate frame of mind in which he is
largely pre-judging trade practices that
lie quite beyond his ken.
He fails to take up, or answer, the
challenge made in the second article
of this series.
challenge was, and it remains un-
A changed, that the Attorney-General
can not prove that Australian private
enterprise just as it is, with all its
apparent imperfections is failing to
serve the public, in their overlapping
capacities as employees, consumers, and
investors. The precise reason for his in-
ability to do this is that year after year
private enterprise is increasing the abun-
dance of goods and services and making
them cheaper {in terms of labor effort)
to buy.
Search Sir Garfield’s comments on the
32 kinds of practices set out in the
booklet and you will find no reference
to any beneficial effects on the level of
production which, after all, matters
most to consumers in the long run. Nor
will you find a reference to any bene-
ficial effects on employment in recently
difficult economic circumstances.
Businessmen would almost certainly
be able to enter a strong plea of justi-
fication in most, if not all, of the in-
stances cited.
The courts, however, would be de-
barred from hearing such pleas, under
the proposed scheme, in relation to prac-
tices (acts and intended acts pursuant
thereto) which are prohibited because un-
registrable, or prohibited because they
had not previously been “fully disclosed,”
reduced to writing, and registered.
Here let me state that, on further
consideration, it appears that few, if
any, of the listed practices would escape
the all-encompassing net of so-called
“monopolisation” one of the pro-
posed new crimes, inexcusably unlawful
in all circumstances, per se.
Businessmen, most if not all of them,
might honestly plead in answer to the
listed practices that they would have
had to reduce output, to put off men,
and to refrain from investing capital
designed to bring about increases in
production and employment in the
future —if they had not been free to
adopt these or similar rrangements to
safeguard their businesses.
What do the Attorney-General and
his advisers understand of the neces-
sity for trade associations, with their
pricing and marketing arrangements,
to alleviate the effects of unpredict-
able, at times violent, increases by
official decree in money wage-rates and
in paid leisure-time?
Pressure by trade unions for the
“wage-fix” (copying the ugly and un-
scientific way in which some of the
authors charge their descriptions of
steady prices with emotion) is an ever-
present reality, and much more of a
handicap to consumers than steady
prices.
Trade unions are really expert at re-
strictive practices, and the law greatly
assists them. Can any unemployed man,
although ready, willing and able, get a
ticket to work on the wharves? Seldom,
if ever. No business practice can com-
pare in severity with this restrictive offi-
cially-supported union practice.
Many people assume that the Attor-
ney-General intends to exempt the re-
strictive practices, and the law greatly
because he stated that: for example, in-
dustrial agreements and contracts of em-
ployment already regulated by law
would be among the specified excep-
tions.
But he informed the Hobart legal
convention that his proposals extend
“with only relatively minor exceptions,
to services”; and they stretch down to
unilateral practices, even oral ones, it
must be remembered.
it would be unjust to clamp
” down on self-employed profes-
sional workers, letting off the much
more numerous other workers. Has not
the leader of the British Labor Party
recently stated (July 9): “We cannot
afford restrictive practices ... on either
side of industry.”
Trade unions could not feel secure
about their continued immunity from
the controls, if ever trade associations
were disrupted in the ways proposed.
Ivory towers give no understanding
of the circumstances in which such trade
arrangements came to be needed to off-
set: first, unpredictable twists and turns
of import policy; and then the shock
of adjusting to the abandonment of the
general system of import licensing in
1960 appropriate though this was
for a free enterprise system, and bene-
ficial though the results have been for
consumers.
Similarly, the Attorney-General has
taken no experienced advice as to sur-
rounding circumstances of justification
in efforts to cope: first, with a baffling

official banking policy; and then the to-
tal and detailed “credit-squeeze” of early
1961 however necessary the latter
was to reverse previous perverse mone-
tary policy, and whatever benefits con-
sumers are now enjoying from monetary
stability.
No allowance is conceded in the book-
let for the fact that a disturbing reces-
sion existed during 1961 and a large
part of 1962, providing many business
concerns ample attendant circumstances
for exoneration.
HPhe issuing of the booklet is plainly a
“demagogic device” to whip up feel-
ing in support of the scheme, when
there have been no spontaneous and
widespread demands for such action
from the public.
An admission is made that it is im-
possible to identify any of the listed
practices as “unnecessary and harm-
ful” without further examination a
lame excuse for a vicious registration sys-
tem. It is a strange conceit if officials, as
in some of the examples, are to be re-
garded as better judges of what is nec-
essary for other people’s businesses. And
the net effect of the booklet is to sug-
gest that the public can detect guilt by
merely reading the list.
All the listed practices, according to
Sir Garfield’s opinion, “destroy or re-
duce freedom of action” as if a free
society cannot permit persons to enter
into agreements giving away a little to
gain as much or more freedom of ac-
tion, and as if such a society cannot
permit competing groups to do likewise,
which we used to demand as “freedom
of association.”
A revealing phrase alleges that these
listed practices also “distort the com-
petitive pattern of free enterprise.” What
is the standard pattern with conditions
and groupings fluctuating hourly and
endlessly? No one knows. Then how
can it ever be distorted? The phrase is
meaningless, except in the theoretical
models of would-be planners of human
lives, and shows no contact with the real
world.
The Attorney-General’s present re-
marks fit in with his reply to Lord Deo-
lin’s suggestion at the Hobart legal con-
vention that, depending on Government
policy in the matter, the onus could rest
on the accused businessman to disprove
the Crown’s accusation that his practice
substantially reduces competition (un-
defined).
“In many instances,” Sir Garfield
pointed out, “the mere descriptions of the
particular practice will answer the ques-
tion. . . . In that event the onus of proof
will be fully satisfied without further
material.”
Apparently, the 32 kinds of prac-
tices he now lists are the instances he
then had in mind. If so, why all the
earlier assurances about burden of proof,
and what chance of a fair trial is he
offering to businessmen?
Consumers have had much to be
thankful for during the past three years,
and relatively little to complain about.
Money earnings have been rising and,
with a steady average level of prices,
there has been accompanying improve-
ments in the general standard of living.
Pensioners, and others with fairly sta-
tionary incomes, have had similar bene-
fits from price stability.
Competition in business life an
ever-present reality when properly un-
derstood has been more marked dur-
ing the past three years than it was in
the preceding inflationary period. When
money becomes harder to get competi-
tiveness naturally increases.
Yet in the same period we have had
a stream of opinions to the effect
that business competition scarcely exists
here, that monopoly is worse in Aus-
tralia than in other parts of the world,
that monopoly is increasing with in-
flows of overseas capital, and that poor
little businessmen are getting their shins
kicked by bigger businessmen.
It all began with the publication of an
article by Dr H. C. Coombs in the
“Economic Record” of December, 1959,
which contained only a modicum of
truth about “administered,” or rigid,
prices. Although the article might have
been seen as a poor alibi for errors of
banking policy, it was widely hailed as
revealing a discovery. Even the Com-
monwealth Arbitration Commission was
temporarily swayed by it.
No one recalled, apparently, that al-
most 20 years before a Harvard pro-
fessor (one of the world’s really great
economists) had discredited the doctrine
that rigid prices cause the capitalist en-
gine to break down. Nor his accompany-
ing sagacious comment that “Individuals
and groups snatch at anything that will
qualify as a discovery lending support
to the political tendencies of the hour.”
Oir Garfield Barwick’s bibliography
contains only a fraction of the writ-
ings since the article by Dr Coombs.
Prominent in learned journals, books,
pamphlets and a section of the Press
have been the regurgitated efforts of an
ingenious and indefatigable visiting pro-
fessor, who has gone home at last.
Did no one in authority remember,
or give sufficient weight to, what this
visiting professor had thought and writ-
ten not many years before?
"Some degree of ideological fervour,”
he wrote, “is more suited to the control
of monopoly than is a scientific detach-
ment.” (The reference is Lloyds Bank
Review, October 1956, page 32).
It is strange that the Attorney-Gen-
eral failed to see through this propa-
ganda, and that his politically more-
experienced colleagues failed to convince
him that its effects, even if not intended,
were subversive.
Elaboration and wider publication of
the facts as briefly set out in the second
article of this series, proving the pro-
ductive expansiveness of private enter-
prise, is the effective answer not the
adoption of the specious arguments and
crippling restrictions put forward by
these academics as the basis for the pro-
posed scheme.
Nothing did more to disturb public
confidence and delay the transition from
recession to the present manifest phase
of rapid economic expansion than this
concerted campaign carried out by a
powerful intellectual group.
ICWidently, it was not sufficient to have
private enterprise knocked out by
getting the Attorney-General to sponsor
a totalitarian Plan. Businessmen, includ-
ing one or two susceptible newspaper
proprietors, had to be persuaded that the
Federal Treasurer (or that Wilson, poor
man) was not causing sufficient inflation.
Controls such as are now proposed are
bred by inflation, and as I see Treasury
policy it is skilfully designed to avoid
both.
Fortunately, Mr Harold Holt released
this year’s realistic “Economic Survey”
to the Press on the same day as the
Reserve Bank gave out a statement of
its Governor’s largely imported and mis-
leading notions about “growth.”
With his recent Budget papers, too,
the Treasurer bowled out his critics
with tangible evidence of real and
rapid economic expansion during the
past year. His far-sighted financial pro-
posals for 1963-64 were also directed
towards the continuance of this real
growth although in a less delicately-
balanced Parliament more could have
been done to stimulate private enter-
prise directly.
Arrival of the much-threatened book-
let, which proves to be a re-hash of spe-
cious stuff and a squib, interrupted the
sequence of these articles, but next week
we shall resume where we left off with
the fourth article.

Aust. Manufacturers Can
Sell To Malaysia
Old Theory Falling Apart
By PETER POLOMKA
HThe theory that Australia as a high
-*■ cost country could not hope to
break into the industrial markets of
South-East Asia seems to be falling
apart at the seams.
Since the trade ship Straat Banka
called on ports along the Malayan coast-
line two years ago, Australian firms have
continued to make steady and, in
some cases, spectacular inroads into
the manufacturing sector- of the coun-
try’s imports. This trend became par-
ticularly evident last year, and figures
available so far on this year’s trading
indicate an ever-stronger movement.
Traditionally, Australian exports to
Malaya have been foodstuffs such as
wheat, flour, milk powder, butter, meat,
fresh fruits and vegetables. In 1961,
foods accounted for more than £lom.
worth of the total exports of £ 13.7 m.
Last year, exports rose to £16.4m.,
but foods increased by only £lm.; the
rest of the increase being in the manu-
facturing sector. This year, according
to Federation of Malaya trade figures,
Australian goods are arriving here in
even greater quantities, but noticeably
the increase is among manufactured
items.
Out of 19 food items listed in the
trade figures, 10 in fact have shown a
decrease compared with last year’s fig-
ures over the same period. On the cur-
rent rate of imports for the first half
year, the value of Australian goods
should reach about £ 18.5 m. this year,
and of this nearly half could be manu-
factured.
/\n the manufacturing side, notable
gains have been made in a wide range
of building components, general metal
manufactures, industrial machinery and
motor vehicles.
Five Australian firms now export cars
to Malaya. Another firm is also con-
sidering opening an assembly plant here.
About one car in 10 among new regis-
trations is Australian-made, compared
with none a few years ago.
Another encouraging sign that Aus-
tralia can compete for industrial mar-
kets in the area is the number of rela-
tively large contracts signed recently.
The success of Amalgamated Wireless
(Australasia) Ltd in gaining a contract
with TV Singapura for two transmitters
is particularly noteworthy since the firm
only recently appointed a staff-man as
full-time Asian representative. Many
firms are apparently realising the need
to have representatives as well as agents,
because the number of representatives
in Malaya and Singapore has grown
from virtually none to more than 12
in the last year or so.
But the average Australian business-
man probably still has no real apprecia-
tion of the standard of living or the
rate of development in Malaya, and con-
sequently is unaware of the trading op-
portunities offered. Alternatively, he
may under-rate the competitive nature
of local trade and the acumen of the
country’s businessmen.
Fortunately, this is changing with the
large increase in numbers of Austra-
lians visiting the region. Enquiries at
the Australian Trade Commission offices
in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur have
increased five-fold in the last few years.
Both offices have been most active in
promoting Australian goods, and their
efforts are undoubtedly reflected in the
strong upsurge in the volume of trade,
as well as in the good trading relations
established between the countries.
T'he Singapore office was established
before World War 11, and the Kuala
Lumpur office six years ago when Ma-
laya gained independence. Now, with the
formation of Malaysia there are sound
reasons for opening a third office in
North Borneo. At present, the Borneo
territories are covered from Singapore,
but this arrangement may be far from
satisfactory during the burst of develop-
ment expected in the early years of
Malaysia. More money is expected to
be spent during the next five years in
developing the two Borneo territories
than in Malaya itself.
Further, Australia cannot afford to
be complacent about current progress
in this region. Malaysia is likely to
offer increasingly good prospects, but
competition from other countries will
certainly be keen. Japan, Germany,
Canada and the United States are all
making considerable efforts to expand
trade in South-East Asia.
For example, in two years, US ex-
ports to Malaya have increased by
60 p.c. from £ 12.7 m. to £.20.5m.
But for the swing towards more manu-
factured exports, Australia, in fact,
could have some difficulty in lifting the
value of current exports to Malaya.
Because of the changing pattern of
the country’s import requirements, the
food market offers little scope for ex-
pansion. During the past decade, the

total value of foodstuffs imported by
Malaya has remained almost static, fal-
ling during this period from nearly
40 p.c. of total imports to about 23 p.c.
last year. Since the Government is de-
termined to become as self-sufficient as
possible in foodstuffs, these imports are
expected to decline even further in im-
portance.
On the other hand, the value of im-
ported manufactured goods, machinery
and transport equipment has doubled
during the past decade, and this upward
trend is likely to continue, encouraged
by the country’s current development
programme. There may be some check
because of balance of payment difficul-
ties, but essential industrial imports
should suffer least on this count.
In the past, Malaya has been ex-
tremely fortunate in its trade balance,
compared with other South-East Asian
countries. Now declining rubber prices
are causing concern, having brought
trading deficits in the closing months of
last year, and again last April.
Each time the price of rubber drops
one cent (Malayan) on the world mar-
ket, Malaya loses sl6m. (about <£2.3m.
Australian) in export earnings. Since
1961, the price has fallen from 90 cents
to 69 cents the lowest in nine years.
Malaya also has an embryonic indus-
trial sector which may need greater pro-
tection from imported goods. The Gov-
ernment is anxious to avoid further
restrictions as far as possible, but should
it consider them necessary, overseas
firms directly participating in the coun-
try’s industrial development will be bet-
ter able to protect their markets.
Several Australian firms are already
established here, and the recent trend is
towards joint ventures, combining Aus-
tralian manufacturing experience and
capital with Malayan capital and labor.
This should be a fruitful partnership
and may point to a permanent and most
interesting shift in the pattern of Aus-
tralian trade relations in the developing
countries of South-East Asia.
Export Success by
New Company
A new Australian company that has
been operating only a few months,
according to the Department of Trade,
has won an order for a transportable
recreation building complex from an
oil exploration company in Libya.
This company is World Wide Camps
Ltd, of Elizabeth (SA).
The initial consignment was shipped
from Adelaide in March, and was im-
mediately followed by an order for 20
pre-built transportable staff quarters and
four palletised bunkhouses. These were
shipped in May.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Wages: “A Certain Inevitability”
Employers “ Astonished ” fey Court Decisions
TTaving watched, but not stood idly by,
as wage increases rushed through
the economy like a bushfire since the 10
p.c. metal trades margins increase was
granted by the Arbitration Commission
on April 23, the chairman of the policy
committee of the National Employers’
Associations, Mr H. W. Robinson, is at
a loss in his annual report to compre-
hend the interpretations given to the
award by the various conciliation com-
missioners and the Public Service Board.
His puzzlement is understandable.
It is important to be clear on the
import of the Arbitration Commission’s
decision on the test case issue. On
February 8, 1963, the Commission re-
affirmed the announcement it had made
when it issued its 1959 metal trades
margins judgment to the effect that its
decision would relate only to the Metal
Trades Award. It went on: “We realise
that on occasions in the past, margins
fixed in the Metal Trades Award, and
in particular the margins for fitters,
have been used as standards for other
awards. The use of any changes in
margins which we may grant as a guide
in other disputes will be a matter for
the parties as far as conciliation is con-
cerned and, if arbitration is necessary,
for this Commission however con-
stituted.
“It is clear from the words used in
1959 and repeated in this case, that it
was not intended then, and it is not in-
tended now, that the decision about
margins in the metal trades should be
applied automatically outside the metal
trades. We trust that the making of this
announcement at the present time,
rather than at the time of judgment, will
avoid the repetition of any misunder-
standing which may have followed the
1959 metal trades decision. It seems to
us that the words used in 1959 and re-
peated now are clear and need no
elaboration and, properly studied, are not
capable of misinterpretation.”
HThe Commission attached such import-
A ance to the test case question that,
in its judgment of April 18, 1963, after
stating what the increase would be and
the reasons for this decision, it added:
“At the request of the parties ... we
took the unusual course of making a
pronouncement early in the proceedings
as to the extent to which our ultimate
decision should be used in other in-
dustries. We now repeat and confirm
what we said then.”
In the light of this, it is quite extra-
ordinary how the pronouncement has
been interpreted outside the metal
trades.
Mr Commissioner Manuel stated, in
granting the 10 p.c. to the concrete
industry in NSW, that the metal trades
judgment obviously meant that the 10
p.c. ought to apply “otherwise I would
be at a loss to understand why those
people in similar situations (that is, other
State judges ■ and commissioners) have
applied the 10 p.c.”
Or, take what was said by the Queens-
land Industrial Conciliation Commission
in granting the 10 p.c. increase to
60,000 employees in the engineering and
building industries and local Govern-
ment as from J uly 11.
“Having given the fullest possible
consideration to the matter before us
and the judgment of the Commonwealth
Conciliation and Arbitration Commission
of April 18, 1963, as to margins, we
have unanimously decided to adopt as a
generality the principle set out in the
judgment, viz. ‘An increase of 10 p.c.
in current margins for employees
covered by the Federal Metal Trades
Award.’
“In our opinion, and with respect, it
is clear that this principle was laid down
by the Commonwealth Arbitration Com-
mission in the full knowledge that it
could not be confined only to the metal
trades. Recent variations of Federal
awards covering employees not neces-
sarily associated with the metal trades,
applying to those awards the principle
laid down in the metal trades margins
case, confirm our opinion.
“There has been ample evidence that
since 1955 increases in margins for
tradesmen in Queensland have been
almost completely dependent on the out-
come of hearings before the Common-
wealth Commission granting margins in-
creases to tradesmen and others and
more particularly to tradesmen, until it
has become very apparent that unions
would have to accept and fully discharge
the heavy onus of proving a case for
margins in excess of those prescribed by
Federal awards. In our opinion this has
become very evident to unions; conse-
quently they feel that, when a margins
decision has been made by the Common-
wealth Commission after a very full
inquiry, there is no great onus on them
to prove a case for the extension of such
decisions to State awards.
The South Australian Industrial Court
took yet another angle. In its decision
on July 5 to apply the 10 p.c. increase
to State awards and determinations, it
stated that “awards would not be varied
automatically but, where margins have
in the past followed or been based upon
a Federal award, they should continue
to be so based, and where margins have
not so followed or been based on Federal
awards, then they should be assessed
having regard to the fact that there have
been increases of 10 p.c. in a large num-
ber of margins in Federal awards.”
Tn Tasmania more general considerations
A prevailed; to wit, when on May 31
the chairman of the Wages Board, Mr J.
Miley, granted the 10 p.fc. increase he
said: “Insofar as its overall economy is
concerned, Tasmania is in no less favor-
able position than the remainder of the
nation. I accept the opinion of the
Federal jurisdiction following its recent
survey of the state of the national
economy that, having regard to the de-
crease in the purchasing power of
margins since the last review in 1959
and to the increased productivity of
industry over the same period, the
economy is capable of bearing a
moderate increase in marginal rates at
this time. For this reason 1 consider
that it is reasonable and practicable for
an increase of 10 p.c. to be made in the
existing margins.”
However, while thus increasing non-
tradesmen’s margins by 10 p.c. Mr J.
Miley decided to increase tradesmen’s
margins by 15 p.c. in order to restore
the value of the tradesmen’s margin.
Unable to trace any generality or con-
sistency in any of this series of decisions
as flowing from what the Arbitration
Commission categorically stated was not
a test case for margins increases on a
nation-wide basis, one turns with even
more astonishment to the recent de-
cisions of the Commonwealth Public
Service Board to increase margins above
the wage of employees in the fourth

“We turn your
customers . . .
into \^J*P’s”
—says the “Chair-man”
It’s surprising how many “V.1.P.” chairs are getting into clubs, lounges
and waiting rooms of various kinds.
Surprising even to us. When we produced the “V.1.P.” range of easy chairs, we went
out of our way to make them extra comfortable and extra strong.
Naturally, they cost a little more* than run-of-the-mill domestic chairs, which are
usually made down to a price, and we weren’t sure whether there would be enough
discerning buyers who would appreciate that the cheapest isn’t necessarily the best.
Fortunately, there were. More and more organisations are becoming aware of the
desirability of providing really comfortable easy chairs as an amenity. They have
also realised that they couldn’t afford to replace or repair such furniture too often, and,
therefore, have to buy easy chairs especially designed
for such a purpose. That’s why they’re buying “V.l.P.’s.”
It you're thinking of buying a quantity oi chairs
or tables tor a hall, club, hotel, etc., perhaps
you'd better ask us for a copy of our quantity
price list.
Also ask for the Sebel 44-page catalogue, and

division by 10 p.c. and in the third
division by 10 p.c. plus.
Mr Robinson finds these decisions
“astounding” in view of the judgment of
the Commission in the 1960 Public Ser-
vice margins appeal case. Never, he
says, in the history of Australian wage
fixation has identical treatment been
given to the marginal content of the
whole range of salaries from the lowest
to highest in the community.
Whilst metal trades employees re-
ceived a margins increase of 10 p.c., the
margins component of their total wage
is not comparable with that, say, of a
public servant. The margin for skill of
a metal trades process worker is 9.3 p.c.
of his total wage, so that a 10 p.c.
margins increase in this case amounted
to less than 1 p.c. of the total wage.
The margin over the basic wage for a
high - ranking public servant in some
cases exceeds 80 p.c. of his total wage,
so that, under the flat percentage adjust-
ment system, he can receive up to a 9
p.c. increase in his total wage. This
great disparity in the composition of the
emolument of the salary earner on the
one hand and the wage earner on the
other hand, is the reason for the
anomalies which occur when the same
sweeping adjustment is applied to both
groups.
“If this approach to wage and salary
adjustment is permitted to continue, the
wage earners will naturally get less and
less of the funds available for distribu-
tion, while the salaried group will get
more and more.”

INVESTMENT SECTION
Some Views from the Reserve Bank
Plea for a Careful Re-appraisal of Business Practices
Tf Mr Holt’s Budget speech appears
•*- woefully short on economic back-
ground, the Reserve Bank quickly re-
dresses the balance with a broad-sweep-
ing survey of the Australian economy
in its 1963 report. The Governor (Dr
H. C. Coombs) has excelled himself
this time, not least in a willingness to
examine some of the sore spots of
growth.
Businessmen and investors must re-
gard a reading of the whole report as a
duty. The important story of interest
rates is dealt with elsew'here in The
Bulletin’s finance section. Here one or
two general reflections may be in order.
Dr Coombs discerns no revival of
boom-like speculation. He is at pains to
point out that the financial consequences
of 1960 “were even more readily ap-
parent in 1962-63.”
Naming no names, “some large com-
panies, which had borrowed heavily
from the public during the boom to
finance property development schemes
and rapidly expanding business and con-
sumer credit found their difficulties in-
tensified and it became clear to investors
that substantial amounts of funds sub-
scribed to these companies’ issues had
been lost.”
The Governor then enters a plea for
a “careful re-appraisal of practices and
policies in the financial and business
community, particularly in relation to
the protection of fixed interest lenders
and standards of reporting by com-
panies.” The responsibility rests on busi-
nesses as much as on governments, stock
exchanges and “other interested parties.”
One other prod to business is “the
need to raise the quality of the W'ork
force, at all levels of industrial and
commercial organisation.” An up-grad-
ing of skills becomes of increasing im-
portance as science and technology ad-
vance.
Not to end on a critical note and to
encourage exporters, Dr Coombs later
mentions that when extended terms of
payment are demanded the Reserve will
grant approval “for terms beyond the
normal maximum of six months after
shipment.” It’s good to learn the num-
ber of cases rose in 1962-63.
A Well-rounded Financier
Australian Guarantee Corporation
capped a vigorous and fertile 1962-
63 by boosting group profit to a new
high of £1,860,051. Shareholders learnt
a few days before the profit announce-
ment that dividend would be held at 15
p.c. for the 10th year in succession.
They must have taken almost as much
delight to see earning rate, up from 21.8
to 22 p.c., slightly more than held on
bonus-increased capital running the first
time for a full year. After all the one-
for-three bonus had been viewed in some
quarters as solely a defence play to
Associated Securities’ cheeky takeover
attempt and it attracted a certain measure
of scepticism.
Directors now stand completely vindi-
cated. They didn't relax, either, for the
improved result is partly attributed to
“continued diversification into general
lending, factoring, and other non-hire
purchase types of financing.”
The future hasn’t to look after itself
entirely, for the year also saw expansion
into Malaysia with the famous Chartered
Bank and direct entry to New Zealand
as AGC following a long period of
operation under a subsidiary.
An actual profit advance of £245,576
was largely facilitated by the £6.2 mil-
lion jump in total outstandings, bring-
ing these to £67.5 million. The accounts
are again to contain the actuarial cer-
tificate “verifying the adequacy of the
unearned income.”
When The Bulletin chose AGC as
“One To Buy” early in June the ss.
shares were available at 16s. 3d. They
still seem a worthwhile purchase even at
the 19s. 2d. level attained on top of the
results.
Factoring Pitfalls
must become all the better
A for the temporary air of disillusion
introduced by the Australian Factors
group. A specialist financing operation,
a rush of public flotations seemed often
to be giving it the semblance of glamor
reminiscent of a few 7 unhappy boom-time
activities.
Scrupulous attention to credit stand-
ing may tend to be relaxed when com-
petition is keen, to inevitable danger.
The careful experts have always felt
that really first-class business has not
been around in large volume.
So all Australian Factors companies—
in NSW, Victoria and Queensland —have
had to decide on independent investiga-
tions to uncover “probable bad debts
arising from factoring of certain ac-
counts.” For the NSW parent a sub-

stantially reduced profit than envisaged
up to December is expected over the
whole 1962-63 year.
The investigations have apparently
and very properly been instigated by the
Jan Potter-associated Australian United
Corporation, now the largest shareholder.
Other highly esteemed shareholders are
Development Finance Corporation, Darl-
ing and Co., and two English merchant
banks, Schroeder Wagg and Minster.
Investors would always assume a high
status in any company fostered by such
institutions. This faith cannot be put at
risk and AUC is to be commended.
The sharemarkets did not hesitate to
lop prices heavily, for example bringing
the Sydney company’s ss. shares back
4s. in two days to Bs. 6d. Sufficiently
speedy reports by directors could pre-
vent movement to lower levels, since
there definitely remains a good future for
well-conducted factoring.
Tax-loss Nervousness?
T ingerie maker Osti Holdings still
seems worth an interest at prevailing
prices. At 11s. 3d. the ss. shares yield a
healthy 6.7 p.c. on the 15 p.c. dividend
held since 1960. The shares went up to
13s. last year.
Investors remain very mindful of the
company’s continued use of tax losses.
On capital raised by November’s l-for-10
bonus issue, the latest £133,239 profit
(an increase of £12,310) actually brings
earning rate back slightly from 25 to
24.2 p.c.
Had tax been payable, at an estimated
£49,500, the adjusted profit would not
show much cover for the £82,500 divi-
dend requirement. But directors are
plainly using the tax losses skilfully and
have substantial remissions in hand.
More importantly, in the immediate
run, orders are at record heights. The
current year should produce a further
profit increase. Forthcoming accounts
can be assumed to continue 1961-62’s
sound appearance.
Exporting Techniques
T>roject Development Corporation
Ltd has outwitted Ready Mixed
Concrete and Pioneer Concrete Services
in announcing the establishment of
ready mixed concrete plants in France.
This is one field in which Australian
companies have been able to show the
way to other nations.
It was a memorable week for Project
Development, which announced the pre-
vious day that profit had risen 21 p.c. for
the year to June, improving earning rate
to 22.3 p.c.
The ss. shares then moved up to the
10s. mark.
PGH’s Record Profit
"VTotwithstanding seemingly continu-
ous rain, PGH Industries Ltd, Syd-
ney maker of building materials, was
able to earn a record profit of £308,369
in the year to June 30.
Earning rate is a very satisfactory
24.9 p.c. against a generous dividend of
161 p.c.
Brisbane Brick Co. Ltd, taken over
in September 1962, is now at the profit-
earning stage.
PGH ss. shares at 18s. 6d. to yield
4.5 p.c., should be good for a further
price advance as the building industry
gathers force in the next few months.
Peko-Wailsend Pay-out
Ohareholders of Peko-Wallsend In-
vestments Ltd scored again with a
fatter dividend cheque this year.
Dividend paid per ss. share was 51d.
in 1960-61, 7d. in 1961-62, and Bd. in
1962-63. The latest final dividend of
4|d. was tax-free to shareholders.
The Orlando gold mine, which opened
in August, 1962, accounted for 60 p.c. of
gold output.
Last May it was announced that copper
ore reserves at the Ivanhoe mine would be
milled before June, 1965. That year
should be especially lucrative, as divi-
dends can then be expected from Rutile
and Zircon Mines (Newcastle) Ltd.
The ss. shares have added 2s. to
14s. 6d. in the last three weeks, and now
show a yield of 4.6 p.c.

Philip Morris v. Rothmans
Tmproved manufacturing efficiency and
substantially higher sales enabled
Philip Morris to turn in a profit for
1962-63 far and away better than last
year’s record.
Earning rate on £1.7 million capital
was 22.9 p.c., dividend 9 p.c.
Compare this with Rothmans’ £3.8
million capital, earning rate of 35.0 p.c.
and 20 p.c. dividend.
Since “Security” analysed the two
together in The Bulletin of June 8,
results for 1962-63 have been published
by both companies.
For the last three years now Philip
Morris has paid out 47 p.c. of earnings,
whereas Rothmans has distributed 49 p.c.
On current market of 365. Rothmans
10s. shares give an income yield of 5.6
p.c. and an earnings yield of 9.7 p.c.
Philip Morris 10s. shares at 38s. 3d. re-
turn a 4.7 p.c. dividend yield, but give the
superior earnings yield of 11.9 p.c.
As Rothmans has a greater capacity
for making capital benefits, and Philip
Morris has indicated no cash issue is
on the programme, Rothmaris shares
look the better value on present prices.
Cement Union
IFhe old prediction that Kandos Ce-
ment Co. Ltd and Australian Ce-
ment Ltd would unite will now come
to pass.
Both companies are equal sharehold-
ers in Australian Portland Cement Ltd,
which operates cement works at Kandos
(NSW) and Geelong (Vic.).
Directors advised that considerable
detail had yet to be decided, and no
immediate general benefits could be ex-
pected by members, “although some ad-
justment will undoubtedly be required
in order to achieve equality of the of-
fer to the members of the respective
companies.”
Capital of Australian Cement is
£2.274,638 against Kandos’ £2,246,208.
Perhaps the arrival of competition on
the Victorian scene has hastened con-
solidation.
P. •ogressive Thinking
T|irectors of William Adams revealed
in several ways their awareness of
the importance of continued market
support for the company’s shares.
With some satisfaction they pointed
out that last year’s drawing on reserves
to distribute a 10 p.c. dividend during
the temporary business decline had been
justified by the latest results.

business in Victoria, an active market
for the company’s shares on Melbourne
Exchange is considered desirable.
The placement will therefore be spread
around amongst Victorian investors in
small parcels, at a small discount on
market price.
At the time of this announcement, at
the annual meeting, the 20s. shares were
495. They have since firmed slightly, but
still yield an interesting 5.0 p.c. on the
12i p.c. annual dividend indicated for
1963-64 by current sales.
Introduction of electronic data pro-
cessing equipment, first in the tractor
company and then throughout the organ-
isation, is another pointer to manage-
ment’s progressive thinking.
Export Incentives Help
of South Australian Cold
Stores say they’ve had a nice lift
from the Federal Government’s export
incentives and, coupled with help from
extra capacity completed by the beginning
of the year, this has helped the company
to a 36i p.c. profit increase this year.
Naturally they look forward to the
continuation of export incentives and
judging from the absence of contrary
references in the Budget this seems to
be a reasonable expectation. Their plan-
ning for an additional 30,000 cu. ft. of
storage space seems well warranted and
it is expected to be in place before the
current year to June 30, 1964, is out.
Market Appreciation
X>(tumen and Oil’s excellent result for
the year to June was not unex-
pected, although the market showed its
appreciation on the day following the
news with some close attention to the
stock.
The brochure published in early May
relating to Boral’s offer to purchase Mt
Lyell Investments Ltd disclosed a profit
of £845,842 for the December six
months, inclusive of a minority interest
of £26,964.
The final result of £1,614,330 for
the year failed to hold earning rate at
quite such a high level. Mt Lyell share-
holders participate in the final 10 p.c.
dividend, although Boral shares were
not issued to them until after balance
date.
Tax provision is again relatively low,
and directors explained in the prelimin-
ary profit statement that certain sub-
sidiaries were not subject to tax because
of past losses.
No profit from Mt Lyell Investments
was included in Boral's group result.
This subsidiary should contribute about
£i million a year in future.

NZ Holeproof Prefs Could
Give Nice Profit
Oince the announcement by the receiver
for Factors Ltd that the Australian
and New Zealand Holeproof companies
would be offered for sale, New Zealand
investors are speculating on the pros-
pects of the preference shares in the
New Zealand subsidiary.
Before the Korman debacle, the
shares sold regularly around 18s. 6d. —
the closing level in 1960 and a price
about normal for a 5 p.c. preference
share.
In 1961 they slipped to 145., and this
downward trend continued last year.
Following a trough of 12s. 6d., the shares
rallied to 135., after the announcement
that preference dividend would be in-
creased to 6 p.c.
Court approval for this step, which
ended a wartime measure pegging fixed
interest rates, was obtained in January
this year, but the shares dropped to a
low of 10s. at the end of April.
The reason was obvious. Although
earning at the high rate of 15 p.c. on
total funds (ordinary plus preference),
preference shareholders stood to lose
most, if not all, of their assets if the
receiver for Factors were to exercise the
company’s joint guarantee of £2,866,661
for the parent company’s debentures.
The announcement that the company
would be sold completely alters the
picture. For it is most likely that the
receiver will try to sell the Holeproof
company as a going concern, complete
with the £250,000 preference capital, by
selling the 750,000 £1 ordinary shares,
now held by Factors, to anyone willing
to pay a reasonable price.
The profitability of the Auckland com-
pany seems to assure that such bids will
be received. In fact, there is some talk in
Auckland financial circles for the forma-
tion of a consortium for the acquisition
of the company. A condition of sale
naturally would be that the guarantee
would be waived.
Under new ownership of the ordinary
shares, preference shareholders suddenly
would find themselves holding sound £ 1
shares with a net assets backing of at
least £6 4s. sd. (based on last year’s
balance sheet) and not threatened by the
possibility of a contingent liability of
<£2.9 million wiping out shareholders*
funds of £1.9 million.
Sellers of some fairly large parcels in
Christchurch realised this too late and
a week after the receiver’s announce-
ment sold out at 11s. 9d. But more re-
cently several sales have taken place at
13s. 3d., with quotations still firming.
Normally, a share with this assets
backing and a 6 p.c. dividend would sell
at par or a little over.
Of course, present buyers take a
gamble on the receiver finding a suit-
able buyer. But they stand to make a
very handsome tax-free capital profit.
TV Station’s Success
TTictorian country TV stations have
’ caught on better than expected with
advertisers and as a result appear to be
getting on a profit basis ahead of pre-
dictions.
Goulburn-Murray Television Ltd, for
instance, earned a profit of £3,989 m
its first financial year of transmission to
June 30, 1963. Directors said that the
company was about six months in ad-
vance of the target set when originally
formed. In June, 55 advertisers were
using the station, compared with only
23 in June, 1962. Support for this Shep-
parton-based concern is coming from as
far away as Albury.

For Queensland - centred Provincial
Traders Holding Ltd has lately fore-
shadowed its highest profit in the year
ended June 30. Furthermore directors
make no concealment of their desire to
expand operations.
Shareholders in general meeting
recently gave them the capacity to issue
shares for takeover, amending a restric-
tive article necessitating the first offer of
new shares to company members. The
facility has been used already.
Provincial Traders is known chiefly as
a maker of margarine and dripping, with
Australia-wide markets for these pro-
ducts. Though sales of table margarine
take place under the limitation of State
quotas, industrial varieties enjoy in-
creasing demand, particularly from
bakers.
After the abovementioned sale of the
fertiliser offshoot, in 1960 to ACF and
Shirleys, Provincial moved into oil ex-
traction and the production of grain and
stock foods. Turnover in such lines has
surpassed the returns from fertilisers.
In that same year came a decision to
go in for chicken broilers. The company
has since grown to the largest chicken
producer in the country, handling the
whole line from breeding and rearing
to retail merchandising. Wide outlets
are cultivated in Brisbane, Sydney and
Melbourne.
Farming operations are not confined
to small fry. Provincial owns grazing
and wheat properties on the Darling
Downs and at Gunnedah. With Fairy-
mead Sugar it bought Croydon Pastoral
Holding in 1961. This property can
carry 10,000 cattle and improvements
will increase the possible carry.
This catalogue of activities plainly
shows how Provincial stands well pre-
pared to benefit in two spheres where
distinct business progress may now be
expected to quicken—food and farming.
But the list is not yet complete. A
hardware, electrical and plumbing sub-
sidiary turns in favorable results. Direc-
tors have just made use of the takeover
rights to “acquire a fat-rendering business
with certain plant on the outskirts of
Melbourne”.
Profits during 1961-62 went from
£192,388 to £221,893, to show a vigorous
earning rate at 22.7 p.c. Dividend, in-
cluding payment for the year to June 30
last, has been kept at 10 p.c. since
1960.
Overall accounts, as might be ex-
pected from the company’s air of care-
ful planning, look in excellent shape.
At June 30, 1962, paid capital of
£1,124,975 was backed by reserves
totalling £681,373.
Shareholders were treated to issues in
each of the four years to 1960. With
the current expansion in train, further
rewards in the near future would not
surprise.
The markets treat the company with
great respect at present. Not much dis-
turbance spread from the latest profit
forecast, details of which won’t arrive
until October.
But the ss. shares are at a highly
respectable 14s. 6d. to yield 3.4 p.c.,
much the same as Marrickville Holdings.
They could easily get closer to 1962’s
top 16s. on further news.
Certainly the shares impress as a
good solid buy, with benefits in the offing.
The company is listed in Brisbane and
Sydney.
Stockbroking for
50 Years
fjp»E Sydney sharebroking firm of Pring,
Dean & Co. in August celebrated
its 50th anniversary and published a
booklet to celebrate the occasion.
As a result, it is learned that brokers
have been operating in Sydney as far
back as 1830, with securities only one
of their many varied operations when
they gathered to do business at the local
coffee houses.
Trading in securities W'as very limited
and it was not until 1871 that an associa-
tion of stockbrokers was formed when
eight or 10 businessmen organised daily
meetings in rooms owned by Edward
Greville, MLC, at 360 George St. There
was no code of rules and no official list
of prices.
By 1572 the group moved to a room
at the Royal Exchange at the corner of
Pitt, Bridge and Gresham Streets and
the name “Sydney Stock Exchange”'
came into being.
Membership cost five guineas in those
days compared with recent prices of
around £15,000 for a seat. It was not
until 1900 that the site of the old Sydney
Stock Exchange was purchased at 113
Pitt Street, and the four-storey building
was completed in December, 1901.
When the firm of Philip Pring was
founded in 1913, cost of a seat was
£l,OOO, plus a guarantee of £3,000.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
John A. Gilbert’s Potential
PThe shares of John A. Gilbert Holdings
A Ltd have not shown much varia-
tion this year although a better perform-
ance was to be expected for the 1962-
63 year than in 1961-62. The shares have
ranged between 16s. and 14s. 6d., the
high point of 16s. having been reached
at the end of January, at the end of April
and again in early June. At this level the
shares show an immediate dividend yield
of 4.7 p.c. and it is not unreasonable to
ask: Where is future growth to come
from?
In December, 1959, the company made
an issue of convertible notes and stated
at that time that no bonus issues would
be made during the currency of the
notes. These notes will convert to ordin-
ary shares on December 31, 1964, and
will have the effect of raising ordinary
capital to £612,188. A 15 p.c. dividend
on this capital would require £91,828.
This figure has been covered more than
twice by earnings in the 1960-61 year
and in 1962-63. Even as far back as
1956-57 (before the notes were issued)
earnings were 18 p.c. greater than this
figure. It is reasonably safe to assume
that the 15 p.c. rate is in no danger,
and the company could, if it wished,
increase the rate to 20 p.c. and still
cover the dividend commitment over 1.5
times.
While John A. Gilbert is basically a
motor dealer, it also provides ancillary
services such as consumer credit and leas-
ing facilities. A few years ago it pur-
chased a real estate agency, but this
activity seems to have been unsuccessful
and was sold early in 1962-63. Bus Lines
of Australia Pty Ltd, which operates a
number of bus services in country areas,
also has a limited profit potential judg-
ing by the statement in the chairman’s
latest address.
Tt seems reasonable, therefore, to try to
make some estimate of future poten-
tial solely on the basis of motor vehicle
trading. The difficulty is to find any
unanimity of opinion in the probable rate
of growth even of the number of vehicles
on register. Mr Maddock (chairman of
John A. Gilbert) said “ . . . forecasts
suggest a rise of 40 p.c. in vehicle popu-
lation in Australia over the next decade.”
This would represent an average annual
compound rate of increase of 3.5 p.c.
approximately. An article appearing in
“The Economic Record” of March, 1963,
written by Keith Hancock, of the Uni-
versity of Adelaide, suggests a growth rate
of 5.5 p.c. approximately to 1965-66.
The following table shows trends in
new vehicle registrations, total vehicles
on register and John A. Gilbert’s sales
and earnings. New Holden registrations
have tended to be slightly more stable
than the total, but nevertheless fluctua-
tions in new registrations have been
marked while the total number of vehicles
on register shows a steady upward
trend:—

Mar. 1963 112 110 118 125 93
Ane hesitates to draw any precise con-
elusions from these figures, but there
is a suggestion from John A. Gilbert’s
figures that increases in sales (in value
terms) appear to produce more than
proportionate increases in profits. From
this point of view, the following figures
in relation to John A. Gilbert’s sales and
profits are interesting:—
Year to 31st March 1959 1960 1961 1962 1963
Return on
Investment % 30.1 35.9 32.8 26.9 29.9

employee (£'000) 18.4 19.9 17.0 16.7 16.9
Sales oer £
invested (£) 6.0 6.9 5.5 5.2 5.3
It seems fairly clear that with record
sales for the year ended March 31, 1963,
profit ratios all showed an upturn. In
these circumstances, it is not unreason-
able to expect a continuation of this trend
despite the extremely competitive nature
of the business.
The company is developing its retail
outlets, and during the last year it opened
its seventh used car lot at Banksia, on
the Princes Highway, south of Sydney.
The new headquarters, incorporating a
showroom and service station, are being
erected at Camperdown on the Parra-
matta Road, opposite the Sydney Univer-
sity, but completion of this building is
likely to be delayed until early in 1964,
although the service division will prob-
ably be in occupation before the end
of 1963.
Some investors could feel concern re-
garding the group’s financing activities.
Net outstandings have nearly trebled in
the last five years. However, the presence
of Mr C. J. Perry on the board suggests
that this side of the group's activities is
run efficiently. Mr Perry was managing
director of the well regarded Associated
Securities Ltd until quite recently. The
chairman’s address has always given suc-
cinct detail of the operations of Credit
& Guarantee Pty Ltd as follows:—
1959 I960 1961 1962 1963
Income to mature as
% net outstandings 14.6 15.6 17.0 18.1 18.9
Average unexnired
contracts (months) 19.2 20.2 20.5 20.6 N.A.
Number of contracts N.A. 1350 1546 2130 N.A.
Unsold repossessions N.A. 6 9 18 N.A.
Looking at the financing for the group
as a whole, the substantial increase in
bank borrowings to nearly £350,000 is
most noticeable. In the 1962 chairman’s
address, it was stated that finance for the
land and buildings at Camperdown had
been arranged on favorable terms, but
the actual extent of this finance has not
been stated. Capital commitments (pre-
sumably relating to the building) amount-
ed to £374,000 at March 31, 1963, but
even if this is all financed by borrowings,
the capital structure, between external
liabilities and shareholders’ funds would
still be reasonably conservative.
Nevertheless, with expectations of ex-
panding sales, the need for further capi-
tal cannot be excluded, and it seems pos-
sible that an issue of equity could be con-
sidered. As mentioned earlier, such an
issue would not place any strain on the
company’s ability to maintain the 15 p.c.
dividend rate. Apart from the conver-
tible note issue in December, 1959, the
last issue of equity was made in August,
1956, on a 3-for-10 basis.
Tt is felt that John A. Gilbert’s shares
A are still attractive at 15s. The notes
which convert in December, 1964, appear
to have a “dividend difference” at this
stage of only 5d., assuming that they will
participate in the final dividend of 1963-
64 as to 50 p.c. thereof. This feeling is
reinforced by the recent announcement
that in the June, 1963 quarter turnover
was up 5 p.c. and profits up 164 p.c. on
the corresponding period in 1962.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Theatre Freeholds Undervalued
of the accounts of Amal-
gamated Holdings Ltd is in itself
not very informative. It is necessary
to peer behind this screen at The Greater
Union Organisation to obtain a clear pic-
ture for investment purposes.
j Amalgamated Holdings is the holding
company resulting from the merger of
SJrencer’s Pictures Ltd, Amalgamated
Pictures Ltd, The Greater J. D. Williams
Amusement Co. Ltd and West’s Ltd.
Spencer’s Pictures Ltd was established
in 1911, and after various mergers, new
companies and liquidations, a half-
interest in the operative companies of
what was by then known as the Greater
Union Theatre group was sold to thq
Rank Group of London in 1946.
In 1958 Spencer’s Pictures Ltd officb
ally changed its name to Amalgamated
Holdings. Main source of revenue
dividends from the Greater Union
group which covers practically all phases
of the film industry.
Component companies of the Greater
Union Organisation are:
• Greater Union Theatres Pty, which
is the major theatre operating, property
owning and management company of the
group. The £500,000 5 p.c. preference
capital is held by Amalgamated Hold-
ings, and the £400,000 ordinary capital
is equally owned by Amalgamated Hold-
ings and Rank.
• Union Theatres Investments Ltd
owns the Sydney State Theatre and the
State Shopping Block. The £350,000
preference capital is owned £130,268 by
Amalgamated Holdings and £37,984 by
GUT. The £500,000 ordinary shares
are all owned by GUT.
• Cinesound Productions Pty is a
wholly owned subsidiary of GUT.
• Automatic Film Laboratories Pty
supplies film processing and ancillary
facilities, and is wholly owned by GUT.
® Rank Film Distributors of Australia
Pty and British Empire Films Pty are the
35mm. film distributors. Capital is held
equally by Amalgamated Holdings and
Rank.
® Sixteen Millimetre Australia Pty
handles a comprehensive range of photo-
graphic and optical equipment. It is
half-owned by Amalgamated Holdings
and half by Rank.
• National Theatre Supply Co. of
Australia Pty supplies theatre equipment
and services for the group. It is equally
owned by Amalgamated Holdings and
Rank.
Since the advent of television, box
office revenue from city and suburban
theatres has fallen away considerably.
To stabilise disclosed profits, directors
of GUT have provided £BOO,OOO for
“TV contingencies” from 1954 to 1961.
The accompanying graph shows profits
over that period before appropriating
these sums.
Peak profits were therefore earned in
1955 and 1956, with a heavy fall off in
1957, and more gradual decline to the
present day. It appears the group’s pro-
fits have now stabilised at around
£250,000.
Company policy now is to convert the
larger city theatres to modern, intimate
type cinemas equipped for long runs.
To this end, the old Palladium was con-
verted, capacity reduced from 1700 to
950, and reopened as the Barclay during
1962.
TV hit attendances in provincial and
country theatres this last year. Compe-
tition in the film production field is also
very keen, and the group obtains an in-
adequate return from capital thus
invested.
GUT has a one-quarter interest in
Rank Xerox (Aust.) Pty which markets
copying equipment. This company ex-
pects to be profitable in 1963-64.
No provision was made this year for
“TV contingencies.” The usual dividends
were paid to Amalgamated Holdings
and Rank.
Profit of Amalgamated Holdings
was £120,974 in the year to June 30,
1963, compared with the previous
£118,382. Result was after writing off
£11,156 in respect of Sydney Tele-
vision Broadcasting Corporation’s un-
successful application for the third
Sydney commercial TV licence.
Dividend is again 10 p.c. for the sixth
year in succession, and includes 11 p.c.
bonus.
The recent anonymous offer for the
Prince Edward Theatre property belong-
ing to Carroll Musgrove Theatres Ltd
shows an emerging interest by developers
in theatre properties.
Freeholds of the Greater Union group
are believed to be substantially under-
valued. The £4.3 million odd shown in
the 1962 balance sheet is the sum of a
1932 valuation of £64,212, and the
balance at cost.
This factor is sufficient argument for
present shareholders to stay with the
shares, now selling at 10s. 7d. to yield
4.7 p.c.

PENDENE LTD
Printer’s
Difficult Year
Oendene Ltd, Victorian printer, manu-
A facturing stationer, wholesale dis-
tributor and merchant, had a difficult
time in the year to June 30, 1963, fail-
ing to cover the usual dividend with
current profits.
Net result from trading was a profit
of £45,762 (1962 £53,952) after lower
tax and depreciation. Total dividend
commitment was £47,250.
This was the poorest public perform-
ance yet, but there was a capital profit
of £21,055 from the sale of assets.
The group emerged in 1946 from
amalgamation of R. B. Shankly Pty and
Bandon Pty. V. E. Martin Pty, a Bris-
bane printer and manufacturing stationer,
was acquired for cash in 1954-55, and
Penmaker Pty of Melbourne, also for
cash, in 1958-59.
A one-for-two cash issue at par was
made to shareholders in 1952, and in
1956 they received a one-for-two bonus.


This has since proved a strain on the
company’s earning capacity, and the pre-
bonus dividend rate of 17! p.c. has been
reduced to 10 p.c.
Shareholders can draw comfort from
the fact that directors held the 10 p.c.
dividend this last year despite insufficient
earnings. Directors are confident the
current year will be more profitable, as
orders in hand are higher, and so are
some prices.
From a recent sale of 8s., the 5s. shares
have been marked down to 6s. 6d. buyer.
7s. 6d. seller. If they can be obtained for
around 7s. the 7.1 p.c. yield could be a
useful portfolio sweetener, but should be
reviewed periodically.

NEW TYPE INSULATORS
/General Electric Company of USA
has developed insulators made of
glass fibre and an epoxy polymer plastic
that may replace porcelain insulators
used on electrical transmission lines.
GE says the new material has one-
third the weight of porcelain, is less
easily broken and potentially cheaper
to make.
EAGERS HOLDINGS LTD
Higher Dividend or Bonus?
in the steps of its southern
States contemporaries, Queensland
Holden distributor Eagers Holdings Ltd
had a record result for the 1962-63
financial year.
The company operates in four of
Queensland’s main centres Brisbane,
Townsville, Toowoomba and Mackay.
It achieved public status in 1957 with the
placement of a parcel of 10s. ordinary
shares through a Brisbane broker and
then listing on the Brisbane Stock Ex-
change.
As would be expected from a Holden
dealer, earning rates have been quite
high, ranging from 21.3 p.c. in 1960 to
15.5 in 1962 and a record 26 p.c. last
year.
This has given a satisfactory coverage
to the 12! p.c. dividend paid each year
since listing except for 1962 when the
payout was 10 p.c.
In the latest year to April 30, profit
rose by 22 p.c. to a record £285,132
after providing £50,849 for depreciation
and £225,150 for taxation. The dividend
payment absorbed only £137,500 of the
earnings.
The company was in a highly liquid
state at the end of the year and because
of a rearrangement by General Motors
on distribution of vehicles, directors
found that the capital required for the
group’s operation had decreased con-
siderably. Consequently they are returning
half the capital by repaying ss. on each
10s. share, reducing the capital from the
£1,100,000, which has existed since
flotation, to £550,000.
The accounts show total reserves of
£606,855 including capital reserves of
£121,241, giving the 10s. shares an assets
backing of 15s. 6d.
The shares are currently selling around
21s. 6d. to show a dividend yield of 5.8
p.c. Following the return of capital, the
dividend yield on the ss. basis would be
down to 3.8 p.c., but as the company is
almost certain to maintain profitability,
the dividend is sure to rise, or some of
the reserves will be capitalised in the form
of a bonus.

ADELAIDE CEMENT HOLDINGS LTD
Happy Shareholders
Shareholders of Adelaide Cement
Holdings Ltd have no cause to com-
plain of their treatment during the year
to May 31, 1963. Another increment in
the dividend, a one-for-three bonus in
April last, and a 25 p.c. increase in net
profit were their happy portion.
Earning rate on capital which ranked
for the dividend (excluding the bonus
shares) was 27.3 p.c. The profit would
have been 20.5 p.c. on the bonus increas-
ed capital.
The company has been producing
cement at Birkenhead in South Australia
since 1913. Capacity has been increased
many times by complete reconstruction
of the cement works since the end of the
war.
In the past some output has been sold
interstate, chiefly in Victoria, but the
Victorian market will not be so open
after erection of the Blue Circle plant at
Geelong. Adelaide Cement has only one
major competitor in its own State.
The holding company was formed in
1960 by the exchange of 12 ss. shares for
each 20s. share in the old company.
In 1962-63 £89,298 was spent on

additions to fixed assets and £206,017
provided for taxation. There is a provision
in the balance sheet of £120,000 for
accrued maintenance.
The taxation provision of £220,273 for
this last year compared with declared
profit of £251,051, suggests a continuance
of the company’s conservative account-
ing and managerial policy.
The current price of around 14s. 9d. for
the 5s. shares gives an immediate return
of 4.2 p.c. assuming (without any
guidance, so far, from the company)
that the 12i p.c. dividend is maintained.
This would require a fairly hefty in-
crease in the pay-out ratio or in disclosed
profits. But as the capital works pro-
gramme has now tapered off somewhat,
this may not be such a tall order.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Clyde and Pye Catch the Eye
Tn spite of prevailing business optimism,
criticism of the Commonwealth
Budget seems to be taking a little longer
to die down this year. Apart from the
usual factional interests, even the brokers
are setting themselves up as economists.
Amongst the profusion of monthly cir-
culars I noticed a few lengthy disserta-
tions. Indeed, one noticeable critique
extended into four pages. I don’t know
about the rest of that firm’s clients, but
it didn’t manage to hold my interest for
much more than the first paragraph.
Anyhow, the market doesn’t appear un-
duly perturbed about what many think
an uninspiring Budget and has continued
its upward trend with some very healthy
rises.
A stock that has not participated
greatly in the market rise is Clyde In-
dustries. What drew my attention to it
was the large amount of option trading
that has been taking place recently. (It
may be of no significance, but two of the
three directors of Clyde are common to
Ducon Industries.) The company has
fallen out of public favor in the last few
years, probably due to that fine cover to
the quite substantial dividend; but
glancing at the very favorable interim
report the company should have had a
very good financial year.
I bought 600 at 11s. convincing my-
self that there was little to lose and much
to gain at these prices.
Another stock that took my fancy was
Pye Industries. I was very impressed by
its remarkable rise in earnings for the
last year, but thought the market had
fairly anticipated it. However, when a
later report came along showing that
profit had been struck after writing off
bad debts to the tune of £240,000, an
amount far in excess of normal, due to
the failure of Inglis Electrix and Reid
Murray, I placed a finger in the pro-
verbial pie and purchased 100 at 745.
Neglecting this amount, earning rate
would have exceeded 80 p.c. on ordinary
capital.
To pay for the week’s purchases I took
advantage of the high market to sell the
holding of Associated Minerals. This
company came out with an earning rate
which didn’t surprise me. In spite of the
soundness of the company I can’t see
the shares going much above 40s. in the
immediate future, especially with that
low dividend yield. Not complaining, I
took a small profit of £23 and sold at
395.
To help that now very large debit in
my account I sold the holding of
Amagraze. Apparently things are not
going well in the meat industry at the
moment, and the recent lengthy spell of
wet weather hasn’t helped. Anticipating
a mediocre report from the company I
sold at a small loss of £l2.
The week’s operations were:
SOLD
200 Associated Minerals, 39/- .... £384
500 Amagraze, 7/6 £194
£578
BOUGHT
100 Pye Industries, 74/- £325
600 Clyde Industries, 11/- £339
£664
This leaves us with a large debit for
the week of £223.

Dawborn’s Record
Melbourne steel
merchant Dawborn Steels Ltd, which
also deals in soft furnishings, excelled it-
self last year to June 30, 1963, by lifting
profit 40.5 p.c. to a new record of
£60,599.
The previous best was £52,262 in
1960-61 when trade in steel (and not
only local) was booming.
In 1961-62 the company still did fairly
well with a profit of £43,137, despite
the recession.
Shareholders are rewarded with a lift
from 10 to 11 p.c. in dividend, which is
twice covered by earnings, as a result
of the improvement last year.


THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Quaint Ideas on Apples
Hong Kong Market Wide Open for Some Varieties
‘C'our members of the Australian Apple
A and Pear Board came home from
Hong Kong recently with rumbles in
their stomachs, and one has just stepped
shakily out of bed after a month with
typhoid.
Their indisposition was probably a
hangover from a week of being feted in
the best Chinese traditions of food and
fun. Air-conditioned Cadillacs ambushed
them at hotel doors. Birdsnest soup
awaited them at the colony’s most
sumptuous tables. And over their
shoulders a cluster of Hong Kong’s
suavest merchants jostled for the honor
of playing host.
The overdose of Oriental hospitality
reflected the recognition Australian
apples and pears are winning on the
Hong Kong market, which teems with
edibles no less than with the products
of machines.
The Australian Apple and Pear Board
is thinking of forming in Hong Kong a
panel of buyers who would have exclusive
rights for handling Australian apples and
pears, and the merchants who wooed its
members so ardently were determined
not to be left out. A similar panel in
Singapore turned that market from a
shambles that was beginning to damage
Australia’s name into a well-regulated
outlet in which all parties are becoming
increasingly happy.
years ago Hong Kong took only
A 20,000 cases of Australian apples. By
1958 the yearly figure had climbed to
53,000. Last year it was 163,000 —almost
as much as to Singapore and more than
a speck compared with last year's British
consignment of four million cases.
Hong Kong importers are anxious to
expand the figure, but there is a catch.
The Chinese like a red apple because
to them red means luck. Australia’s most
widely-grown variety, the Jonathan, is
red, but it is claimed that these apples
are too sweet and soft for the Chinese
taste. For flavor and firmness, the Granny
Smith would be ideal, and it would su : '
us to export it because plantings of
Granny Smith have expanded in recent
years. But the Granny Smith is green,
and a compromise with Chinese pro-
vidence. The variety that best combines
the demands of flavor and fortune is
the Delicious, but there is not enough
of it to take advantage of all the potential
the market offers.
The problem is being approached in
several ways. Efforts are being made to
counter the color superstition with
publicity, and the board is hopeful about
the outcome because other markets,
such as Germany, have swung from red
to green in recent years. The board is
also trying to get Australian producers
to direct more fruit from local markets
into the new export trade.
Tn the past, NSW and Victorian grow-
ers have been inclined to hold their
fruit at home because the price differen-
tial has not been great enough to induce
them to export. But this is changing as
production overtakes local demand —a
situation that prices on the home market
this year were already beginning to
reflect.
Although last season’s 163,000 cases
to Hong Kong from Australia consisted
mainly of Delicious, in no State does the
variety predominate.
A question facing the board in its long-
term planning is whether to concentrate
on pushing green apples in Hong Kong
or encourage the planting of more De-
licious. Although the call for Delicious
looks good now, it might well be that,
as Granny Smith continues to win
markets, enough Delicious will be releas-
ed to exploit the Hong Kong demand
without expanding the supply.
Meanwhile, the board will decide
whether Hong Kong could benefit from
restricting the franchise for Australian
fruit as much as Singapore did. A few
years ago that market was chaotic. Any-
one could order any quantity regardless
of what the market could absorb, and the
position became hopeless. Fruit went
bad on the stalls, merchants lost heavily
and Australia was accused of skul-
duggery. A panel was set up to feed the
market with a maximum of fruit without
creating oversupply and low prices.
The associates on the panel meet at
the beginning of a fruit season and in
consultation with the board fix a quota
for the year. Among other things, this
enables shipping requirements to be
accurately forecast.
On their Hong Kong visit the board
men saw an echo of the Singapore trouble
in over-ordering by merchants wanting
to make their figures look good so that
they would be considered as members of
the panel, rumors of which had filtered
through the board’s security net. They
also saw how sensitive is this market.
During their stay, a shipment of 10,000
cases of Australian fruit arrived, and
immediately the price dropped to a point
where importers were losing.
Tn most markets of this size one ship-
load would have little effect, but half
of all the fruit sold in Hong Kong goes
through 5000 street hawkers who are
acutely reactive to the slightest economic
nuances and who on any given day single
out the type of fruit that will show the
most profit rather than trade in a variety
of fruits like any western greengrocer.
The market is one in which apples
compete not only with other apples but
with all types and varieties in the horti-
cultural spectrum, from lemons to lichis.
The panel would not only regulate the
supply of apples (which far outnumber
pears on the market, because pears are
thought to promote coughing) but see
that they reached the colony at the right
time of year March, April and May
when there is no competition from fruit
from the New Territories and mainland
China.
If it is formed, another step will have
been taken towards immunising Austra-
lian primary production against fears of
Britain’s next Common Market bid.
Apricot Kernels Exported
for Cosmetics
IT" ernel Exports Ltd, a company
operating at Shepparton (Vic.) for
the sole purpose of exporting the kernels
of apricots, seems to be doing a thriving
business. It collects stones from the
several canneries in the Goulburn River
Valley and from Melbourne canneries,
and extracts the kernels.
The company then ships them to
Britain, Holland, Germany, Denmark
and Hong Kong, and there oil is extract-
ed from them for use in cosmetics. The
residue is used for making marzipan.
