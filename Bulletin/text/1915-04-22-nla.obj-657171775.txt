Roofs make for
Artistic Homes
White Malthoid Roofs are just the trusted Malthoid with a coating of Asbestos. They are
absolutely watertight, and they wear well —they do not crack, chip nor rust. But they
have another good point—they are artistic, attractive; they add to the appearance of the
houses they’re put on; another distinctive feature about White Malthoid is that it will
keep the heat out, and the cold out, too. Have your home roofed with it!

BECAUSE it contains the Germicidal and Antiseptic virtues that
have made Eumenthol Jujubes famous the world over
BECAUSE it is not only an Antiseptic and Germicide, but cleanses
mechanically, owing to the evolution of oxygen when in con-
tact with water or moisture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the Teeth so wonder.

The Red Page
A Sonnet-Sequence of the
Year —in Australese
“Sr.” : May I chip in about the “Red Page” sonnets
—the finest parcel of poetry I’ve ever read-—and
“John Drayman’s” remarks thereon (“Red Page,”
5/3/’l4) as to actual Winter Dread that exists in
Tassy. “John” must have got his information on a
fortnightly tourist trip from an old cabman. I live
here, have done so for the last five years after living
in Victoria. I am no poet, so perhaps don’t possess
dreads, but if “John” looks up any meteorological
authorities he will find that Hobart’s winter weather
is no more rigorous than Melbourne’s. For the last
two years there has not been one football match post-
poned on account of bad or wet weather in the
southern capital. Hobart never sees snow in the
streets. Launceston has fogs; but for the winter
there being more dreaded than in Sydney or Mel-
bourne, well, it is not. I repeatedly have to visit
Melbourne in the winter, and I always want to get
home again to dodge the winter there.

’N’ raisin’ dust, ’n’ shooin’ grass away,
’N’ suckin’ rivers dry, ’n’ knockin’ fear
In cockies’ hearts; fer ’im, becripes, a bier
Wot ’as ’is jag, nor don’t arst ef ’e may!
December’s like a bloke wot’s jes’ grew up,
’N’ feelin’ strong ’n’ rorty, wild fer fun;
’E makes the pace too ’ot ’n’ does ’is block,
Then takes a pull; the wowser says, “ ’ls

Er joy is spilt, ’is wickid course is run”—
But ’im, ’e knows there’s wild days still in

LAST HOPE.
More War
A U.S. publicist, J. William White pre-
sents America's Arraignment of Germany
(Unwin; Is.). Of course, there is no United
States—the war has at least done the world
the service of making it clear that the melting
pot has hot managed to melt anything except
itself. The Disunited States consists of a
majority of Yankees and various minorities
of Germans, negroes, prize-fighters and sun-
dries. That is why Wilson remains polite
but nervous. A declaration of alliance with
the Allies would mean civil war; and the
Disunited States are not yet sufficiently Ger-
manised to plump for the Entente. Obviously
the Ununited States favors the Allies; the
author states that with the exception of the
“German-Americans,” on the publication of
England’s White Book, the country ranged
itself spontaneously and with practical unani-
mity on the side of the Allies. He proceeds
to the categorical arraignment of the Hun
on the question and answer method, utilising
fully documentary evidence from both sides.
He quotes, for instance, the conviction of a
retired German Major-General, that “The
ugliest stone placed to mark the burial of a
German grenadier is a more glorious monu-
ment than all the cathedrals Europe put to-
gether.” And he aptly recalls the fact that
Belgian neutrality was solemnly affirmed by
the leaders of Germany in 1913, and even on
July 31, 1914, by the German Minister at
Brussels. And with reference to Germany’s
arrogant claim for her Ivultur, he reminds us
that: “The Germans contributed little or
nothing to the development of the railroad,
the steamboat, the automobile, the aeroplane,
the telegraph, the telephone, the phono-
graph, the photograph, the moving pic-
ture, the electric light, the sewing
machine, and the reaper and binder.
Even those dread instruments of war,
the revolver and the machine gun, the
turreted ship, the torpedo, and the submarine,
are not due to the military ardor of the
Germans. It would seem as though the Ger-
mans had been lacking in the inventiveness
which is so marked a feature of our modern
civilisation.”
As to the duties of the Disunited States,
the author points out that that country was
a joint signer with the Kaiser of the Hague
Conferences of 1899 and 1907, among' the sec-
tions of which was a recitation of practices
which the signers solemnly undertook to ab-
stain from in war. Expressly prohibited were
pillage, the levying of illegal contributions',
the seizure of funds belonging to private per-
sons or local authorities, the destruction of
buildings dedicated to public worship, art,
science or charitable purposes, the killing of
wounded, etc. And he asks whether a nation
can afford to put its name to a document
and then stand by in icy neutrality while
that document is being torn to~ shreds by
another of the high contracting parties? The
answer is, obviously, that the Neutrited States
is not a nation. The melting pot is merely a
garbage tin. J. William White, in the name
of the majority opinion of the best elements
in the garbage tin, calls strenuously for some
form of intervention on behalf of the Allies,
and adds: “If our intervention brought vic-
tory to thb cause of the Allies a month
earlier than it would otherwise come, it would
be justified.” He has reason for believing
that “before long” it will be felt to be the
duty of the President to show the Kaiser that
the sympathies, and, if necessary, the support
of the United Hesitates are pledged to the
cause of the Allies.
G. K. Chesterton decorates the war with
apt alliteration and pretty paradox. The
Barbarism of Berlin (Cassell; 6d.) is Ches-
tertonically characteristic. Pale paradoxical
pills for pink patriots.
• J*
An English governess employed prior to
the war in the household of one of the Super-
Huns has several interesting facts to relate
in her story, What I Found Out in the House
of a German Prince (Chapman and Hall, per
Dymock’s Library). Her charges, the prince-
lings, boys of five and six, used to play a
war game invented by Zeppelin, in which toy
zeppelins were manoeuvred over large models
of London and Petrograd and flour bombs
were dropped on the principal civil buildings.
Delightful pen-pictures are given of the
Super-Bosches, the Kaiser, the Crown
Prince, the Krupps, Bernhardi, and the other
“dome-heads” supposed to be the mark of
all the greatest men in Germany. Bern-
hardi, we learn, regards women not much
higher than animals, he contradicts his wife
and always walks ahead of her in the street.
He was, to the governess, “the most ruth-
less, brutal-looking man I had ever met, the
very type of militarism in flesh and blood-; —
especially blood.” She states that her mis-
tress, “very much ‘in’ with the highest court
set in Potsdam and Belin,” often let slip
official secrets to her. One was that the
Crown Prince’s instructions on his trip to
India were to ascertain the state of feeling
among the native rulers towards Great
Britain —in other words, he deliberately
accepted the hospitality of Britain in India
as a spy. And while this goggle-eyed youth
was a guest of a high native dignitary he
disgraced himself by an attempt on a lady
of the harem. One or more British officers
sacrificed themselves to save the culprit.
•‘Something horrid had happened, and every-
one in the secret was sick with disgust and
rage.” And the Crown Prince “funked”
badly when he inspected the two spirited
mounts provided for him to go pig-sticking
with the Inniskilling Dragoons at Muttra.
To save his face he had to pretend sudden
illness. Both Kaiser and Crown Prince,
though brave, are liable to these sudden
nervous attacks. “By the fear of what cruel
people might call ‘funk’ the Kaiser has been
debarred from flying with Count Zeppelin
or Orville Wright, or any other of the air-
craft inventors who would gladly have given
him an opportunity. Occasionally the same
over-powering qualm of nervousness seizes
the Crown Prince.”. Unfortunately one of
these occurred in the presence of a British
regiment.
The governess found herself mixed up in
the German secret service. Her services,
without her knowledge, were utilised to
assist German spies to gain information in
England. We learn, too, that the Kaiser
w'ent occasionally incognito to Paris, and
that General von Ivluck actually paid a visit
to some quarries near Soissons—the famous
quarries which turned out to be German
trenches, prepared a year before the war.
It seems, from this story of the Kaiser, told
to the author by her mistress, as if the
Crown Prince’s famous looting exploits are
hereditary. “Everybody knows that the
Kaiser only borrowed the wonderful Pales-
tine Bible in the Berlin Museum. He will
never give it back. He saw it in Syria,
when he was there, and begged to be allowed
to take it home to show to the savants.
The guardians. .. .had no authority to lend
such a book, and dared not do so The
Kaiser tried to bully the Berlin museum
authorities into buying the Bible, but as it
was worth nearly five million marks, they
couldn’t afford it. At last the Kaiser
induced the Sultan to use his influence” —
and Berlin got the book, the Kaiser pledging
himself to return it. The Countess thought
the world ought to be grateful to the Kaiser
for bringing such a treasure to Berlin.
Gossipy and readable, these iniimate
descriptions of the Super-Hogs have a defi-
nite topical value.
&
The German Delusion forms the chief topic
of J. W. Allen’s Germany and Europe
(Bell, per W. Dymock, Sydney, 2s. 6d.).
Without that delusion Hogmany would
never have gone to war. The Bruteons
appear to have convinced themselves of
their real, definite, absolute superiority
to all other peoples. At least, they
have tried hard for the last 40 years
to convince each other. The Bruteon, in
this delusion, is simply behind the times.
Not so very long ago every Englishman
believed that he, individually, was worth
three Frenchmen. According to Hogman
historians, all progress since the c (lapse of
the Roman Empire, all achievement in art,
science and philosophy has been the work
of the Bruteonic Tace, either directly or as
a result of Bruteonic fusion with the con-
quered and worn-out peoples of the Empire.
“Now she stands forth, armed and ready,
conscious of her Divine mission, God’s
chosen people, first in arms as in arts, to
redeem the world. And she stands alone in a
world of degeneration and of barbarism.”
And yet even the word “Prussia” is hot
German!
Many Hogmen appear really to believe
that the salvation of the world lies in the
spread, by force if necessary, of something
they call “German culture.” The nearest
equivalent to Kultur would be the word
Civilisation; but it is impossible to give any
precise meaning to this large-sounding Hog-
man word. Still more difficult is it to
define the phrase “German Kultur.” What
culture has Hogmany that other Europeans
have not? “What is the specific element in
German civilisation which the rest of the
world needs so sorely that Reims Cathedral
must be battered and smashed in order that
we may get it? Personally, lam not aware
that up to the present Germany has given
us anything to equal in value a single one
of the great statues on the west front of
Reims.” The only possible answer to this
question is that Hogmany has for the world
a new religion, the religion of Woden or of
Napoleon or of Zarathustra—or of Callan
Park.
Our task, and maybe our hardest task, will
be to destroy this Hogman illusion of
superiority, “A people that has actually
built Berlin, and yet believes itself capable
of building something finer than Reims
Cathedral, would seem to be hopekss.”
_ Allen writes with restraint and without
bias; his attempt to state a for Hog-
many is obviously honest; amid the host of
ephemeral war publications his fittle book
is worth consideration.

The Man Who Uses tlie
GEM JUNIOR Safety Razor
MAKES SHAVING EASY.
GEM JUNIOR blades are as thin as an edge-holding piece of steel can possibly
be rolled. They can be sharpened time and time again, because they're tempered
to receive an edge and to hold it when they get it.
THE GEM JUNIOR FRAME has a new BAR feature which carefully
spreads the skin so that the stubble is forced out far enough to give as close
a shave as can only be secured with any other razor in the world by going over
the face twice.
TIIE GEM JUNIOR SET is packed in substantial Plush-lined Box, and in
addition to the Silver-plated frame and seven blades, includes a stropping handle.

OLD BLADES Made NEW
Save your old blades. After they have passed beyond the stage
of revival by means of the ordinary strop, the Safety Blade Expert
can renew the keen edge of the hand-ground blade with the
patent power high-speed machine specially designed for Safety
Razors. It sharpens any Wafer Safety Razor Blade.

IF your bicycle is a B.S.A. every

its easy running qualities.
At the end of twelve months you
will realize what B.S.A. reliability
means, because the repair account will
be practically nil.
When you think you would like a
new machine you will be pleased your
old one was a 8.5. A., because you will
be able to sell it for a good price, while
if it had been a cheap “ pattern ” machine
it would simply sell as "scrap iron.”
You get better service all round if

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Turn of the Tide.
A long time waiting with little to show,
We sat in our boat, at either side,
While the listless weeds washed to and fro.
And here and there, at the will of the tide.
The bay was still, and the trees and flowers
That nodded at noon w'ere all asleep;
Yet never a silver-bream was ours.
And never a crimson lord of the deep.
With little to say and much to think.
We watched, while the velvet hours went by ;
The ripples arise and the ripples sink.
Alone on the waters —Rose and I.
I said to her then: “The good time flies.
Let us get hence, for the bay is wide.”
Rose lifted her dark blue, laughing eyes.
And “Wait,” she said, “till the turn of the
tide.”
The bay was azure from east to west —
All still and azure from north to south;
The rose that reddened on Rose’s breast
Was red as the rose of Rose’s mouth.
“ ’Tis weary waiting,” I said to Rose.
(Was ever a rose as fair as she?)
“The love-hour comes, and the love-hour goes.
And when will the bright ‘Yes’ spoken be?”
Then Rose grew red —do you wonder why?—
And, somehow or other, I said or sighed :
“The line is set, but the prey is shy—
I’ll wait, dear Rose, till the turn of the tide.

Pale Sunday Lovers.
They are as pale as dough, and she wears
specs.
He has a boxer and a long-tailed coat.
They “walk out” speechlessly —two fragile
wrecks
With large heads wobbling on thin, halt-
starved necks.
Where’er they’re bound, they’ve “just got
off the boat.”
If they have thoughts, they don't exchange
them now,
But. overawed by Marriage in advance
And the sweet weight of, their engagment
vow%
They wander aimlessly and anyhow,
A foot apart. This is the true romance.
She gazes longingly with glassed-in eyes
At well-kept villas as they loiter by.
She has her dreams; but she at heart is
wise
And knows right well, however hard he tries.
lii some small, humble shed they’ll live and
die.
Are they to wed next year and so defy
Eugenics, Death. Insolvency and Care?
Or have they solemnly agreed to tie
Their future's up till he attains some high
And dizzy height such as a chief clerk s
chair?
They are ashamed. Their awkward, writh-
ing w'alk
Proclaims the fact. His foolish coat-tails
flap
About his thighs. Her vacant face of chalk
Books like a slice of old and speckled pork.
But she is “nice” and he’s a decent chap.
They arc “respectable”! ITow r could A ice
haunt
Such tails as his and her gold Sunday specs!
To Satan they would jointly cry “Avaunt!”
Did he accost them on this speechless jaunt.
But would he worry once he’d seen their
necks?

Clarinda.
Clarinda. is as fair in face
As when I first became her slave.
Her figure still preserves its grace;
And every charm that made me crave
Her heart survives. Yet she to me
Seems now less fair; for 1 am wise,
And future dangers I can see —
There's something wrong about her eyes!
And yet her eyes are deeply brown
And lit at times with subtle fire.
They have a beauty of their own
Enough to stir the heart’s desire.
One time I verses wrote to them.
And in their glances took delight;
Their beauty I do not condemn —
There’s something wrong about their sight.
\Ye walked together on a day
When all the earth was glorious.
I spoke my heart in careless way
About life’s golden springtime. Thus
She answered me, with sombre air
In rather melancholy vein :
“There is a dark cloud over there,
And I’m convinced that it will rain !”
“Here with the earth-stars, many-lined,
About our feet, awhile we’ll camp,”
I cried in joy, still unsubdued.
She answered: “No ; the ground is damp ”
And when, alternative to that,
A skiff I on the river found,
The tempting trip she murmured at:
“I am afraid we might be drowned!”
And so it was throughout the day
That to me seemed so fair and bright,
“The sun’s too hot,” I heard her say
(’Twas “chilly” coming home at night).
And while on joyance I was bent
She saw all clouds that marred the day,
And picked some cause for discontent
From everything that round us lay.
I strive to see the best on earth ;
And Sorrow, with its lifted head
To search for causes marring mirth,
Is not for such as I to wed.
Clarinda’s faults I cannot blink :
Though still I love her otherwise.
My heart turns cold whene’er I think.
There's something wrong about her eyes!

The Model Bicycle is Built for Reliability.
What are the particular points about a bicycle that will cause you to make your final
selection? Will you take the bicycle that has the best “shine” to its enamel, or glitter to its
nickel? No, hardly that. You of course prefer a bicycle to have these things, but then you
must first, consider more important features. It must be strong; it must be light; it must be
moderately priced.
The “Model” has these attributes. Every turn of the wheel, every flash of the spokes in the
sun, and the steady whirr of the chain as it carries you along swiftly, quietly and safely, tells
of strength, reliability and power,
It is made to our own order Below are the specifications
by one of the best bicycle of this machine, which we
builders in Australia. Each part consider to be the best

THOSE WHO WAIT FOR HELP.
Ik the story of the big war there is nothing
that grips quite as hard as the knowledge
that broken Belgium is waiting with pathetic
trust for the day when victorious British
troops will march into Brussels whistling
“Tipperary.” Belgium’s children starve;
her fields are full of the graves of men ; her
women have faced the last thing in horror.
But the big hope remains, and British boots
may yet stir the dust of Quatre Bras and
Waterloo while there is a Belgian nation
left to rejoice. At present, however,
progress is being made only by inches,
and unless the German runs out of
nitre to make his powder, or gets so
short of sausage and potatoes that he can
no longer stand up to his gun, or is con-
verted by the Peace Society, the faith of
Belgium will have a still harder strain put
upon it before the conquering cheers that
mean a square meal and a sound sleep are
heard in the streets of her capital. Let the
help from outside come as fast as it may, the
waiting is tedious; and history is full of
stories of those - who hung on in fearful
expectation of the aid that never arrived.
From the day that llezekiah waited
vainly in Jerusalem for news that Tiehakaii
had crossed the desert and smashed the
Assyrians to the hour when an Irish rebel-
lion passed out in smoking thatch and grim
military executions because of the late and
inadequate assistance of the French, the
weak and ill-prepared have suffered un-
speakable things through putting their trust
in outside help. The fault has not always
been with those who offered their aid, nor
has it been humanly possible to prevent
delay and misfortune. The French did try
to assist the Irish rebellion; Tieiiakah did
try to come to Jerusalem’s rescue. A thou-
sand expeditions have been fitted out by
the strong to help a weak ally to shake off
the oppressor. But take the story of such
undertakings first and last, it is astonishing
to note the smallness of their success and
the diminutive part in history that they
really play. On the other hand, some of
history’s brightest pages are those which
record the triumphs of small peoples left to
their own resources who by preparation,
forethought aud determined loyalty to
themselves have hurled back invaders of the
largest and most terrifying sort. An exami-
ration of actual facts must modify the
most sanguine person’s view of the extent
to which even the biggest military country
can protect a small ally from the things that
really count in warfare.
The case of Belgium is not exceptional
. when examined in the light of the past; but
Time has made this change—what was
always difficult in the old days has become
practically impossible now that a blow can
be delivered with such speed and a mistake
can be rectified only at such appalling cost.
Hence the talk of protection of smaller
nations by larger is now in a general way
worth nothing. It is easy to say that if
big Mexico suddenly and without cause
poured troops into small Guatemala, the
still larger United States would interfere
and see fair play. As a matter of fact, the
United States might fight Mexico to a stand-
still .and still not save Guatemala from any
of the real horrors of the invasion. The
final result could make no difference to the
people whose homes had been broken, whose
women had been ravished, and whose whole
plan of life and outlook upon the world had
been torn in the sack and carnage.
The chief handicap from which Austra-
lian Defence suffers is the deeply-rooted
belief that this country is protected from
without. It is this which colors the remarks
of the politicians and of the man lighting
his pipe at the corner. Yet in reality, even
with such protection as we nominally pos-
sess, Australia is about the most exposed
and unsheltered country on the face of the
planet. Had Germany, when preparing her
great assault upon England, pursued a differ-
ent policy, sent a fleet on a world voyage
that would have made her mistress of these
seas at the date of the prearranged declara-
tion of war. and concentrated an attack upon
the Australian capitals, what would have
been the exact value of the protection in
which we have trusted so greatly? It is
perfectly true that, after months spent in
sweeping the North Sea of mines, England
might have delivered a tremendous assault
upon the German naval ports in her home
waters; but it is equally certain that all the
horrors known to the Belgians would have
been felt in Australia, and that we should
still have been starving and hoping and wait-
ing for the relief that might come, but must
come too late. Judged by the present aspect
of the war, such a line of procedure on the
part of Germany would have been about the
best that she could have pursued in her
attempt to make her navy effective; and
whatever the final results of the general con-
flict might have been, it is difficult to see
how it could have failed of a measure of
success. At _ any rate, it is quite certain
that no British protection could then have
saved our homes from shame and our people
from bitter suffering.
* * * *
Australia, from her peculiar position, and
beset by dangers of a peculiar nature, has
need of all the protection she can get from
Britain and from her association with other
British countries; but the safeguard offered
by a promise of assistance from a distance
is of no more real value than the scrap of
paper on which the Kaiser set his boot when
it threatened the march of his army. The
blow that strikes Australia may fall without
an hour’s official warning, and the only
defence possible is that which is prepared
and waiting at the moment of the first chal-
lenge. Relief, vengeance, what you will,
may follow; but Australia’s protection lies
in the weight with which she herself can
strike the invader. In the light of this know-
ledge all future preparations must be judged.
A. Defence system which trusts to outside
aid to better its own inadequacy can be of no
use to us.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Party of Incurable Jibbers.
During the last few months Joe Cook and
his friends have now and again explained
m ysteiies of Libeial policy; but though
no one could understand what they were
then talking about , Liberal idea s were
crys tallised into simple form last week when
the Federal Parliament met. “Let us
eschew party politics, pass necessary war
measures and close up,” cried Joseph. This
means, of course, that the truce Joe
would^t Ugten t ’ o during the elections
should now come into operation—that a
Parliament, elected to discharge some very
definite obligations, should take morphia
into its veins and go off to sleep until a mess
ten thousand miles away is tidied up, which
may be to-morrow or the next day or on
some date so far in the future that Joseph
will find even fewer hairs on his head when
peace arrives than he can discover now. For
rest and quiet—for the undisturbed peace
of the valetudinarian bottle-oh with a pipe
and a newspaper-—the Australian Liberal
yearns with pathetic intensity. It is noth-
ing to Cook that to the people of the Corn-
monwealth a revision of the tariff is a mat-
ter of vital importance, or that the amend-
ment of the Constitution is more pressing
than ever before, or that the Northern Ter-
ritory shrieks for attention. To him these
are merely matters of trifling moment, to be
put on the shelf and taken down for leisurely
inspection later on, or—preferably, no doubt
—forgotten in the mock fury of a sham-
fight concerning preference to unionists or
about the electoral rolls. Nor is this frantic
desire to bolt for the bush peculiar only to
Cook. “There is nothing urgent except
matters relating to war,” babbled MiLlen
in the Senate. Even the tariff and the
cost-of-living question are insignificant. To
Australia these questions are not insignifi-
cant. They have a place of importance
almost equal to that of the war ; for though
national existence hinges to some extent on
the struggle in Europe, the problem of indus-
trial development goes to the very root of
the nation’s social life. To argue that
because the people are engaged in fighting
an enemy in the field they should condemn
themselves to continue, thus weakened, an
unequal struggle with commercial oppo-
nents may be Liberalism, but is just plain
idiocy all the same. The fact is that Cook
and Millen don’t want to do the work they
are paid for. And because they don’t want
to handle such a question as the tariff, they
imagine', or profess to imagine, that the
electors also want the matter hidden away
behind a bogus truop arranged in the inter-
ests of a few bewildered individuals whose
normal attitude is one of opposition to every-
thing, including work.
Is the High Court to Leg-rope Justice?
Tiie knot into which the High Court of Aus-
tralia tied itself by the judgment in the
Father case last December seems to be even
more confused than The Bulletin sus-
pected ; for it now transpires that, in with-
drawing from Eatiieb that leave to appeal
which they had previously granted him, at
least two of the Judges did not know what
they were doing, and another one appears not
to have understood what the effect of his
finding would be. Eatheb, it may be re-
called, was convicted of an offence at Syd-
ney after the presiding Judge (Hamilton)
had ruled that certain evidence tendered by
the prosecution came within the scope of
“the corroborative evidence which implicates
the accused” demanded before conviction is
allowable under the Crimes Act. Eatiieb
appealed to the Full Court against this rul-
ing, and the appeal was heard by Chief
Justice Cullen and Justices Being and Sly.
Cullen and Sly held that Hamilton was
right; Peing that he was absolutely wrong.
There was grave difference of opinion on a
point going to the very roots of the law of
corroboration —of what “implicates” a per-
son accused of a particular offence —-and the
appeal was by leave carried to the High
Court, the point at issue being determination
of the construction to be placed in future by
the higher and lower Courts in N. S. Wales
upon an integral part of the criminal code.
There was long argument before four Judges.
It is known that they differed. They
ordered re-argument before the Full Bench,
and the matter was thrashed out some more
at great length. Then by a majority it was
decided that the Court would have nothing
to do with the thing—that Eatheb and his
appeal could go to Hades, because the Court
had decided to set up a rule for itself by
adopting the practice followed in criminal
appeals by the Privy Council. That prac-
tice is to entertain criminal appeals only in
cases where justice in its very foundations
has been subverted. This decision, by
which the Court evaded its obligations to the
nation, had the immediate result of estab-
lishing as a precedent the more than dubious
ruling of Judge Hamilton which settled
Eatiieb, and the wider consequence of bang-
ing and bolting the doors of the High Court
as a place of appeal against the erroneous
construction of the criminal law. And it
has the additional and even more amazing
feature that among the majority of Judges
there was one who now admits he agreed
with Isaacs (the only dissentient/ that the
ruling of the Courts below was fatuous, and
another who “thought he was following the
practice of the Court.” The matter has
since December been referred to occasionally
by the Court, but last week it bobbed up in
a new form; and finding they could not
dodge it, their Honors fell over the obstacle in
a large, muddlesome heap. The question this
time was whether Chidley, the citizen of
abbreviated attire who pervades Sydney,
could appeal against a conviction sustained
by a divided judgment of the State Supreme
Court. A majority of the High Court
thought he couldn’t, because of the rule laid
down in re Eatiieb ; the remainder of the
Court thought that, if he couldn’t, there was
something seriously wrong with the legal
machine. The upshot of a tangled discus-
sion was that their Honors went into hiding
at the beginning of the week, and, removing
their wigs, settled down to a good hard
think. The position they find themselves in
is a fairly serious one, and for the people
of the Commonwealth perilous to the last
degree. Under the Constitution which gave
it birth, the High Court of Australia was
established as a Court of criminal appeal.
For it to go behind this and decide that,
instead of being the medium through which
criminal jurisprudence may be shaped, it will
merely make interposition in circumstances
almost inconceivable —and by copying the
Privy Council rule it has done this, or. at
any rate most of the Judges think so—4s a
something the Legislature should not tol-
erate. This naper is not much concerned
about either Father or Chidley individu-
ally : but it has a strong desire to see the
criminal law so laid down that no doubts
can exist about the course of Justice.
♦
The Greater Criminals.
There are two classes that deserve to be
hanged or boiled. One is composed of a
sort of working man —the working man
who gives practical approval to the pro-
paganda of the I.W.W. Some leaflets
recently issued by the body which calls it-
self the “Fighting Union” contained the
following counsel: —
Slow work means more jobs. More jobs means
less unemployed, and less competition means higher
wages. Less work. More pay.
SLOW DOWN, SLOW DOWN.
HOW TO MAKE YOUR JOB EASIER.
GET WISE TO I.W.W. TACTICS.
Don’t be a Pacemaker, someone has to be the
slowest, let it be you.
Australia needs just now men who, if they
won’t go away and fight, will at least stay
behind and work. The call for workers who
will butt in with the utmost vigor and help
to produce khaki and small arms and
canned goods and boots and a thousand
other requisites of warfare was never so
acute. The alternative for the member of
the “Fighting Union” who scorns to be a
pacemaker, and incidentally for his family,
may be such experiences as are now being
endured by Belgium and Servia. What
shall it profit an I.W.W. enthusiast that
he got wise to the “Fighting Union’s” tac-
tics, and slowed down, and refused proudly
to be a pacemaker in April 1915 if in April
1916 he finds the country where he is pursu-
ing his leisurely existence faced with inva-
sion? The fact that he did less work, and
encouraged others to follow suit, will not
mitigate for him the pain of seeing his
womenfolk outraged and such property as
he may have destroyed. The rotten worker
has his prototype at the other end of the
scale in the rotten capitalist. It was estab-
lished in the Senate last week that one
firm of contractors had supplied the Aus-
tralian Government with military boots the
sole-leather of which would not have stood
more than two days’ wear. Another con-
cern engaged to supply candle-boxes of
weight, and provided goods which
were 4oz. under weight in each case.
Napoleon hanged the swindling contractors
of France, and his methods with workers
who either shirked or malingered in the
time of their country’s great need were
equally sudden. Strenuous measures of the
sort are being taken in Europe, even in
these humanitarian times, with proved
traitors. The worker who deliberately
“slows down” when his defenders on the
other side of the globe are perishing for
lack of clothing is as blameworthy as the
patrol who leaves his post to sleep behind
a hedge; and the manufacturer who sup-
plies his country’s army with shoddy is in
the same category as the outcast who sells
it for a spy’s wage. But, because the war
is still far away and because Australians
are congenitally casual, the nation’s most
dangerous malefactors remain at large
while comparatively respectable burglars
and forgers continue to go to goal in large
numbers.

Holman’s Eloquent Tears.
That extraordinary person, W. A. Holman,
took advantage of the discussion on the
totalisator at the P.L.L. Conference in Syd-
ney to exhibit himself as a man who stood
foursquare to the limelight of purity and
high devotion to principle. He proclaimed
himself as one who was sternly opposed to
the shifts and expedients of tinkering reform
—as one who would cut his right hand off
before he would bring the Labor platform
down to a level on which gambling should
be regarded as worthy of the consideration
of the great movement. It was a line pose
and calculated to win blind Support from
those whose inmost convictions are to be
swayed by a finely-modulated voice and the
use of fluent phrases. Holman came to the
Conference under a cloud of suspicion. He
knew it was charged against him that he
had betrayed Labor, failed to do the work
he had been appointed to do, neglected the
Labor platform, and associated himself with
its enemies ; and he knew also that a bold front
and a puritanical pretence of political right-
eousness might prevent those charges being
pressed home. In this knowledge he rushed
on the Conference, took the elephant by its
tusks, and orated delicately in its ear a
statement that looked like a schoolboy’s des-
perately planned excuse for neglect of home
lessons. Lie explained, in effect, that the
war had been very fierce, and, owing to the
disturbance which it had created, it had been
found quite impossible to carry through
those things which, if he had kept his
promise, should have been done long before
the war started. He assured his hearers,
also in effect, that black was very often
a covering for white, and that if they would
watch until their eyes got the right focus,
they would see that black in this instance
really was white. As for the things left
undone, there was no reason why they
shouldn’t be attended to right away, always
provided that the war behaved itself. But
in any case they should wait and see. The
effect of the oration upon the delegates was
mixed, but Holman knew that this was
only the first round. The second arrived
when the totalisator discussion gave the
opening. Then the elocutionist rose to the
full height of a Mark Antony. He de-
nounced the totalisator machine on the
ground that Labor should oppose the iniquity
of gambling in all its forms, and he wept
rhetorical tears that a great movement, for
whose principles he had in the remote past
gone to gaol—when was this, by the way?—
should descend to the awful depth of taking
the racecourse punter under its protection
and enabling him to get a fair deal. Of
course, the common-sense of the Conference
carried the totalisator proposal, but Hol-
man had scored to the height of. his desire.
He stood forth the scourged and persecuted
champion of Labor’s ideals, who even now
would stand in the pillory for an ethical
principle, and who would oppose to the last
tear drop the degradation of his party. For
a man who had for long had it in his power
to carry out the best portions of the Labor
platform, and who had not only failed to do
so, but had run directly counter bath* to their
spirit and letter, the pose was a remarkable
one. Yet the political contortionist con-
trived to get himself accepted at face value,
and by his admit tears won to himself sup-
port in the very direction in which he most
needed it, Nohady can doubt Holman’s
histrionic ability.. He contrives to be the
villain of the Labor drama for SO weeks of
the year, and then turns round and becomes
its hero for the two weeks that really count
with the organisation that nominally' controls
him. All this is a tremendous danger to
the Labor party. At present there is but
one Holman, but his success makes it cer-
tain that he will soon have; plenty of imita-
tors. With 20 skilled elorntdimists in the
field the P.LX. Conference would become a
mere mutual admiration society, and the
Labor platform would be a toy trotted out
annually as the central object, in a game of
rhetorical hide-and-seek, interspersed with
stage heroics and theatrical tears. Labor
as a political organisation has failure written
large across it, and for the earnest men in
the movement there are two Broad courses
open. The party can retain the form of life
and palter down to real death by remaining
an electoral machine for the sim-mit of
HoLMAN-ism and all that it means, oy it can
decide upon its own death bv the abolition of
party, and so rise to a newer and stronger life
without the old name hr the old catch-words
that have proved so empty.. In a system of
non-party government Holman might be
quite a useful member of any' legislature- The
very ability that he has used to warp and
twist the intent of his party could be har-
nessed to solid and enduring work when there
was no further place for trick or finesse;
but for HoLMAN-ism there could be no room
at all in the new order. The mandate from
the people could neither be brushed v aside nor
explained away. The business of the Gov-
ernment would be simply to give it the effect
of law, and even a Holman in office could
not get round that simple position. Elective
Ministries and the Referendum with Initia-
tive had the seal of the Labor movement set
upon them long ago. It is about time the
old planks were brought to the front again
and put into practical use. As the political
game is being played at present, Labor —the
real party, with large holies and big enthusi-
asms —cannot score a try because its own
backs are defending its opponents’ goal. The •
position is ridiculous, and the sooner a new
set of rules is formulated the better for
everybody—not even excepting W. A. .
Holman.


Naticual Efficiency.
Victoria’s Minister of Public Works
llagelthorn, who is by way of being a
Itich Landlord, proposes to import a “lead-
ing professor of a well-known American
university” to teach the State points on
“national efficiency.” llageltiiorn’s idea
is excellent, but its details are simply dis-
astrous. In the first place his expert will
have to spend at least two years obliterat-
ing his views as a Yank and building a
fresh set in accord with our industrial sys-
tem, with its eight-hour day, arbitration
courts, wages boards, etc.; and long before
he has crystallised the new ideas it will
have been borne in on the Minister that an
Australian, not necessarily a professor,
might have done the job better and in
shorter time. “National efficiency” is
merely a synonym for organisation, and the
avoidance of that waste which this country
is simply revelling in. The waste of effort
involved, in our happy-go-lucky ways of
distributing our daily food supplies is monu-
mental. It would take the swiftest expert
on earth a good many years to put right that
mess. Then he could put in another similar
term grappling with the waste of effort
caused by the breaks of gauge. After that
he might apply his “national efficiency”
policy to the absurd practice of dragging
wool from Riverina to Sydney and wheat
from Horsham to Melbourne, and similar
wasteful habits all over the Commonwealth.
When that job was finished the expert could
lay his vast intellect on to the waste of
effort involved in sending greasy wool to
England—or Germany—to be scoured,
twisted, woven into cloth and sometimes
made into garments, and then dragged
back. If the expert had any , time on his
hands after he had abolished 12 unneces-
sary Houses of Parliament and six super-
fluous Governors he might get busy on the
waste ,of effort indulged; in by the thousands
of unnecessary “commercial men” in the
big cities, with their clerks, typewriters,
travellers, canvassers and other adjuncts.
After that —well, _ the expert may want a
rest. That there is room for a million tons
more “national efficiency” in Australia is
undoubted, but so far as he has indicated,
Hagelthorn’s idea of the substance
begins and ends with the policy of speeding-
up workers in factories, which is a mere
mouse of a conception to make a fuss about.
A Proposal to Destroy Farm Cove.
The proposal to take the stuff excavated for
the construction of the Sydney city railway
to form a road around Farm Cove should
rpuse general protest. Two or three years ago
roads were outlined in connection with the
scheme for turning Government House into
something democratic though indefinite, but
the idea seemed to have been mislaid or for-
gotten. Now it is revived in a new form
which threatens to be even worse. The pub-
lic gardens around Farm Cove are about the
choicest possession of the city, and their
best point is the clean water-frontage to the
little bay. All smells stop outside the
railings, and the women and children
have a playground of the most beautiful sort
that is kept really free from pollution. This
seems to annoy Ministers to such an extent
that they pine for the honk of the motor and
the reek of petrol in the pure and quiet
place. The proposal to make public roads
among the lawns and flower beds having met
with general disapproval, they come again
tq the attack with a scheme to throw rock
and spoil into the sea in front of the gardens,
in order that by hook or crook noise and
stench may be introduced between the popu-
lar resort and the water that gives it charac-
ter and charm. The water frontages about
the city which have been reserved for the
people are few enough, and decency would
suggest that they should be increased rather
than diminished ; but this is evidently not
the State Government’s view. The remark
of a city alderman that the proposed road
would not interfere with the gardens is
evidently. an echo of Ministerial opinion.
But it will convince nobodv. The proposal
to make a road round the Cove is simply a
proposal to steal the people’s most delightful
water-frontage in a tricky fashion. Were
the Government to fill up Mosman Bay with
rpeks and rubble, could any sane person be
found to _ declare that the gardens of resi-
dents which reach to the water’s edge had
not been interfered with? The public should
see to it that the spoil from the city railway
is not thrown into Farm Cove, even if the
State Premier and his colleagues have to eat
it a clod at a time.
The Breakdown of the Constitution.
Abe the Australian States federated, or is
the whole thing a dream? Having seized all
the wheat in N. S. Wales, and put police-
men on duty to see that not a bag went to
a foreign country like Victoria, the Govern-
ment has now placed a heavy foot down on
trade in butter. The wheat seizure was
justified by the argument that no N. S.
Wales surplus existed, and that if any
wheat was permitted to go out of the State
the deficiency would have to be met by im-
portation from abroad. In the case of but-
ter, however, no shortage of supply is alleged
to be likely. There has been copious rain-
fall all summer in the coastal dairying dis-
tricts, and the cow cockies’ output shows no
sign of shrinkage. But in Victoria, where
the drought has been particularly severe, the
inhabitants have had to rely to some extent
on N. S. Wales and Queensland. So the
N. S. Wales Government has decided that
Victorians, being mere aliens, are not en-
titled to get more than 10 per cent, of the
butter made in the Ma State. All of which
is merely a second instalment of State Spite,
and another reminder of the limitations in
the instrument by which it was fondly sup-
posed that trade and commerce within Aus-
tralia had been handed over to the control of
the Commonwealth. It looks as if before very
long trade with neighboring States in Aus-
tralian products will be as difficult to carry
on as trade with the enemy; for the
Bumbles who now rule the roost obviously
look upon local boundaries as frontiers.
When the other States begin to take a hand
in the game the position will be magnificent.
When Peace Comes.
Up to the present, Germany is inviolate.
So, to all industrial intents and purposes, is
Austria. Their manufactories are intact.
In many cases these concerns are not only
capable of beginning to turn out huge quan-
tities of finished goods the moment peace
arrives, but no doubt they also hold large
stocks. In the happy past the pur-
chaser had a wide area of choice
among manufacturing nations. The buyer
of motor-cars, for example, who didn’t
fancy German-made articles, could go
to Belgium or France and get as good, or
better. Pianos, toys, glass and countless
other products were made as well and as
cheaply by one nation as another. To-
day, Belgium, one of the busiest of manu-
facturing countries, is a waste, and so are
some of the richest parts of France. As in-
dustrial rivals to Germany they are likely
to be out of the hunt for years to come. If
the Hun caves in within a limited time—in
other words, before his own territory has
been invaded —he will thus be in a favorable
position to rehabilitate his national for-
Also, he will have the spur of Neces-
sity .digging into his flanks. In order to pay
the gigantic indemnity that will be demanded
of him he will need to work harder than
ever, and he will require to produce more
and to sell it cheap. No one who knows the
German character can doubt his ability to
do these things. To whom will he sell?
Plainly to those nations whose tariff walls
are inadequate to keep his sweated goods
out. Foremost amongst them is Australia,
the country which is already suffering bit-
terly' from its inability to supply itself with
munitions, small-arms and military requi-
sites in general—a legacy of the foreign-
trade habits of generations of politicians. If
Germany fights to the last—if it battles
desperately on while its territories are over-
run aud the woollen manufactories of Saxony
and Bavaria are destroyed, and the glass
and porcelain works of Thuringia and Silesia
are dynamited, and the silk concerns of
Rhenish Prussia and Baden go under, and
the great iron-works, and paper-mills and
machinery shops and breweries ascend in
smoke—countries such as Australia will get
a fortuitous Protection which, incidentally,
they do not merit. Their industries will have
a chance to forge ahead, not through any
merit on their part, but because so much of
the civilised world is in ashes. But in the
likelier event of Germany deciding that, if
it can’t hold on to Belgium and the North-
East of France, it' can’t put up an effective
resistance at home, there will be but one
thing to save the Commonwealth’s existence
as a manufacturing country, and that is a
tariff. And when one remembers that by
the time Peace arrives Germany will be so
broke and so desperate as to be willing to
sell almost anything it has for the price of
a blutwurst sandwich, the necessity of mak-
ing Australia’s tariff wall one of the loftiest
in history becomes very apparent.
Get in the Ruck, Young Man!
If the N. S. Wales Labor Government offers
B. R. Wise the job of Agent-General pro
tem. it will be a small reward for the work
which he has done for the Australian demo-
cratic cause. Wise’s public career is a
complete sermon on the unwisdom of walk-
ing in the van—just as G. H. Reid exem-
plifies the advantage of dodging cautiously
along in rear of the main body. Wise
was a Federalist when Federation was un-
popular among self-styled Right-thinkers,
more especially in N. S. Wales; and at a
time when Reid, Higgins. Piddington and
other high officer-holders of to-day were op-
posed either to the thing itself or to the
scheme proposed. For some years after
Federation the issue in the Australian Par-
liament was almost exclusively the tariff.
Wise, the Cobden Medallist, visioned the
urgency of high Protection for Australia and
was sufficiently courageous—and, from the
point of view of his own material prosperity,
foolish —to say so in the most bigotedly
foreign-trade part of the Commonwealth.
Nowadays the necessity of a high tariff, more
especially against cheap German, Austrian
and Yankee goods, is a gospel even in
Woollahra and Rose Bay.- At the time Wise
first talked high tariffism thq doctrine was
heresy even in Woolloomooloo. When Wis'E
first introduced arbitration the employing
class carried on as though he had imported
the Devil. Arbitration has not entirely
stopped strikes, of course, any more than the
criminal law has entirely abolished theft.
But with all its faults the community clings
to it still and declines on any account to
revert to the old. anarchic state of affairs of
the" ’9o’s and earlier. Ten years ago the advo-
cate of compulsory service and an Australian
fleet was regarded in well-to-do circles (and
in many others) as a Socialist, and a vision-
ary,. a fool, and one who wished to
wantonly insult the Crown and the
Flag. Wise was one of the earliest
Defence enthusiasts to be heard in pub-
lic. He advocated the Referenda, too, when
an affirmative answer seemed an impossibility.
As a reward for his foresight, or progres-
siveness, or congenital lunacy, or whatever
it is, he has now the chance of a 12 months’
job as State Agent-General. How much
subtler was the political part played by
G. H. Reid! He opposed Federation
bitterly—till he sensed the fact that a
majority of the electors wanted it. He
talked Freetrade for as long as N. S. Wales
votes attached to it, which was for years
after it had been dead as regards the rest
of the Commonwealth. He tried Anti-
Socialism on the constituencies, and jet-
tisoned it when he found that it wasn’t
going down. He fiercely fought local
Defence till the country declared for it,
and then he became its warm upholder.
Always he was the adopter of his oppo-
nents’ best ideas ; the reaper where others
had sown; the tory cuckoo in the demo-
cratic nest; and his reward for consistently
lumbering along a mile or so in rear of the
legislative ’bus has been several of the best
jobs in the nation’s gift. The spectacle of
B. R. Wise thankfully taking the Agent-
Generalship—it may be for long and it may
be for only 12 months —while G. H. Reid
relinquishes the High Commissionership in
the reasonably well-founded expectation of
a seat on the High Court bench, is one that
should be considered diligently by all ambi-
tious young politicians so long as the abomi-
nable party system endures. The lesson
of it is that the successful politician must
on no account seek to propel the vehicle of
progress, but rather dig his heels into the
earth and suffer himself to be dragged pro-
testingly in its wake.

The trained Australian officer who is kept in
the Commonwealth while the foreign service
commands he hungers for are bestowed on
militia officers of far less experience, is not
the only fretting regular we have. The rank-
and-file are chafing just as much, and dis-
appointed permanent artillerymen are writ-
ing poignant poems to this paper about the
ignominy of being detained to sweep out
peaceful seaside forts and polish taps, while
raw amateurs are pouring into the camp-
schools to hurriedly train for the real thing.
British Territorials have relieved the regu-
lars at such accessible places as Malta.
Can’t remote Australia also stop putting the
military cart before the horse, and give the
deserving local specialists a chance to practise
their life-job? Complete efficiency should
not disqualify a soldier from soldiering, and
keep him carefully in the background sweep-
ing barracks and writing embittered verse
about his unheroic lot.
Elwood Mead, the expert engaged from the
U.S.A. to put Victoria’s irrigation schemes
on a workable basis, goes back home next
month. Mead is a genial Yankee who knows
just about all there is to know concerning
water when it is available; but the recent
drought caused him to wear a worried look
when the vaunted Waranga Basin supplies
petered out, and the settlers in the “smiling”
irrigation areas got a taste of what the dry
farmer across the road had been having all
the time. Not that Mead didn’t do his best
to avert the calamity ; but when Labor mem-
bers began to nose round in search of ammuni-
tion to use against the Water Commission
and Peacock’s Government, he got sick of
it all and suddenly remembered a fat offer
from over the water. It must be said to Mr.
Mead’s credit that he was always sympa-
thetic and courteous in his dealings with the
wild and woolly settler from Overseas, who
is apt to be a bulldog when up against adver-
sity. One such bulldog went to strike the
one-armed chief during a peppery interview.
But Kennedy, chairman of the Closer Settle-
ment Board, happened to be there, and he
just took that tyke by the scruff of his neck
and threw him out into the street. Still, in
spite of his good points, it can’t be truthfully
said that the settlers are sorry the Yankee
is going. They like him as a man. but official-
dom of any kind is out of favor in the chan-
nel country since the Waranga trickles gave
out.

Judge Backhouse, Solomon of N.S.W.
Marine' Court, dealt the other day with the
case of the harbor lighter Hornet, which
sank outside Sydney Heads a few weeks
back and drowned a member of its crew.
Briefly Backhouse’s conclusions were :
(1) Plainly the Hornet was quite uns.eaworthy and
unfit to proceed to sea.
(2) The vessel was not provided with a certifi-
cated master.
(3) There was no lifeboat on board to save the
crew.
(4) The Court mourned with the deceased sailors'
relatives.
(5) The Court was blessed if it could see any-
thing eke to do.
But what about the maritime statutes which
provide for the punishment of owners and
masters who send or take manslaughtering
craft to sea? And what is wrong with the
penalties to be inflicted when ships go voyag-
ing without being properly officered or
equipped? If the Marine Court can’t en-
force them, what is it on deck for? If only
for weeping crocodile tears over waterlogged
seamen, then it is an expensive luxury that
we can’t afford in these strenuous times.
The High Court decided last week that the
notice warning passengers on N. S. Wales
railways against pushing themselves outside
carriage windows is no part of the contract
they make with the carrier. A man had the
usual elbow beyond the alignment, when the
usual swinging door of the usual passing
train led to the usual doctor’s bill and the
usual banquet of Costs. The small Court
gave the man £lOO damages. Enlightened bv
more expensive argument the Full Court said
the-small Court didn’t know, its job and re-
versed the judgment. Now, either enlight-
ened or obfuscated by still more argument,
the High Court decides that the Full Court
was the one which sruessed wrong; and if
there is any of the £loo'left th.e man who was
long ago awarded the amount can collect it.
Still, even if a man-has a surnlus elbow, it
will be hardly worth while hanging it out of a
railway window on the strength of the High
Court judgment; for the passenger will have
to show, seemingly, that he wasn’t “unreas-
onably” negligent; and that stimulation gives
large scope for the consumption of Costs,
with grave doubt as to the ultimate result.

Customs Minister Tudor was waited on the
other day by a deputation from the Victorian
Sawmillers’ Association asking for increased
duties on timber. The deputation made out
a strong case, but not stronger than the facts
warrant. Canada, the U.S.A. and Russia
are the only countries with a larger forest
area than Australia. Yet from its
100,000,000 acres of forests, 27,000,000 acres
of which are reserved for timber, this coun-
try derives a revenue of only £254,000; while
it buys from the foreigner—including, until a
few months ago, Germany and Austria —tim-
ber and wooden goods to the value of
£3,920,000 annually. On the other hand our
exports are worth only £903,000. From
Amurka we buy yearly over £1,200,000 worth
of tree, chiefly Oregon and hickorv, produced
under conditions which allow it to be shipped
to this country and sold at a cheaper price
than local hardwoods, which experts have
a hundred times affirmed are superior to most
of the imported stuff. Great Britain im-
ported in 1913 £42,725,000 worth of timber,
including £5,427,000 worth of hardwoods, but
this country supplied only £243,000 worth.
In the same year five countries —Russia, Ger-
many, Austria, France and Belgium—which
are now drenching Europe with blood, sold
to the Ma country timber and manufactures
of timber valued at £15,522,000. That sup-
ply being now mostly cut off, Australia might
be doing a service not only to itself, but also
to Ma, by interesting itself in this matter.
But even if we could only keep our own
market it would be a great thing. A5O per
cent, reduction in our timber and furniture
imports would mean an increase of £2,000,000
in the value of our factory products, and the
spending of well over £1,000.000 extra in
wages. Customs Minister Tudor said the
business would "receive attention”; but if
this means waiting for the Inter-State Com-
mission to report, the Australian timber in-
dustry might almost as well set about order-
ing from Uncle SiiAM the wood for its
coffin.
—
Victoria’s Fruit Commission lately un-
earthed an “honorable understanding” which
calls for attention. The “arrangement” is
the property of the Australian Dried Fruits
Association, which practically controls the
output of Mildura, Renmark and Irymple.
At the beginning of each season this body
fixes the wholesale quotations for raisins,
currants, dried apricots, etc. The grocers
who mentioned the thing made no complaint
about the prices fixed, though they thought
some of them might be lower without any-
body being hurt; what they did object to was
the Association’s stipulation that anybody
who bought “outside” should get no more
goods from inside. Two Melbourne grocers
swore that they were offered Goulburn Val-
ley fruit this season at Id. a lb. less than
the Association figures; but as the growers
couldn’t guarantee a regular supply, the
tradesmen dared not buy. A legal member
of the Commission remarked that there was
law directed against restraint of trade. Also
there is a State Attorney-General sworn to
administer the" law. Appearances, however,
suggest that both are fictions.
The party system spread itself over the
P.L.L. Conference at Sydney, and mocked at
the delegates. True, there are traces of the
system within the Conference itself; but
none of the groups would think it necessary
to sack the secretary because he was sus-
pected of leanings towards some other
group, and when elections are held the offices
are shared pretty equally amongst the repre-
sentatives of the various factions according
to the “form” they display, the men and
women being chosen for such merit as may
exhibit itself on , appeal to the delegates. In
spite of this method of dealing with its own
affairs, the Conference allowed the foolish
party system in Parliament to turn it into an
impotent gathering of wind-smiters. The
bulk of the delegates gathered with a fixed
idea that Holman deserved censure. Hol-
man met them with gaseous explanations
that explained nothing. Though it is pos-
sible his word-spinning convinced some
of the delegates that he was right, the
majority of delegates felt that he was
hopelessly wrong. Had there been
no party system in Parliament hold-
ing members to blind allegiance to
a leader who says what must be
done and what left undone, the Conference
might have asserted its will —would, un-
doubtedly, have done so. As it is, the big
organisation, with every reason to be angry,
dared not even be indignant, and bowed its
foolish head to the threat of a man who has
violated practically all its principles, and
turned Labor int> a mendicant at the door
of Cohen. The Worker pictures the posi-
tion by showing a small Holman shaking
a fist in the countenance of a giant. If the
giant had been shown tied ir the bonds of
the party idea, and helnless though wrath-
ful, the situation would have been illus-
trated more completely.

the Panama Exposition:—
I saw the Tower of Jewels, the Palaces of Beauty,
the. Fountains of the Risirg Sun, and the rest of it,
and was publicly assured by Governor Johnson that
any comparison with previous shows was impossible.
Yet it all seemed nothing but a great dollar-snaring
device, and all the turgid oratory about the “immense
educational value” sounded like the escape of hot
air. A meal fully up to the standard of a six-
penny “joint” in Melbourne or Sydney costs a dollar,
and everything else is proportionate robbery. I
stayed a week, and life during that time was made a
weary burden by a swarm of “bums,” who offered to
sell me a motor-car, or a gold-mine, or a chicken
farm, or an invalid's chair, or the latest edition of
the Scriptures. Apparently this crowd mistook me

His mind through all the spindles flies,
And crank and pinion shout or groan
Obedient to his master eyes.

From this stupendous battle toil;

These hammer blows the foes despoil.
In valiant metal deftly wrought
A nation’s deeds the world may see.
And death by lathe and anvil taught
Brings the proud foeman to his knee.
Afar the day is dark with smoke,
( An iron tempest shakes the world ;
Grim ranks of war with stroke on stroke
From vantage points of doom are hurled.
Advanced, forced back, in grim retreat,
Spent, but unconquered, still they strive;
And day and night the hammers beat
To keep their battle strength alive.
Not on the hillside scourged with woe,
Not where the wasted cities burn,
But where the furnace forges glow
The chariot wheels of triumph turn.
The foeman breaks, the day is won.
In clamorous rout his squadrons reel,
And victory crowns for labor done

CHEMIST TELLS HOW TO STOP
INDIGESTION.
SAYS USE OF PEPSIN LEADS TO
CHRONIC DYSPEPSIA.
“It is a wonder some of us have stomachs
left ” remarked a well-known chemist
recently. “While all chemists sell a score or
more of stomach remedies for which there
is a wide demand, most of them are just
pepsin pills, which aid digestion of the food
that is in the stomach at the moment. They
have no curative or strengthening effect on
the stomach at all, and, of course, do no
reach or cure the cause. So the same peop e
keep on coming here and buying and using
them until they are real chronic dyspeptics.
When anyone really asks my advice I swear
by and recommend ordinary bisurated mag
nesia, which doesn’t digest the foo< i, at all,
but acts as an antacid and sweetens the sour
fermenting contents of the stomach.; lhat
stops the pain, heartburn, sour rising, wind,
floating, fulness, etc., in just a fe^ D i'jW tes ’
and the stomach digests' its food without help
or trouble, which is the proper way. „
“Doctors make mistakes sometimes too,
he continued. “My own aunt had all kinds
of trouble with her stqmach for yea|i; ®“®
bought and used several styles of digestive
pills, but got worse right along, as naturally
she would. Finally she went to a doctor,
who nearly scared her to death by telli g
her she had cancer of the stomach s
came to me with his prescription and told
me what he said. I thought it waa non
sense. I sent her to another doctor whom !
knew very well, and he didn t tell her any
thing, but just gave her this same th g,
bisurated magnesia. She took it gr
weeks, and never has had any »tomacn
trouble since, and that’s

the manacles, the branding irons, the 72-pound pun-
ishment balls, the leaden-tipped cat-o nine-tails, the
coffin bath, the iron cages,” and all the rest of the
convict outfit. The spruiker declared that ‘ this ship
has held iniquities beside which the most blood-
curdling stories of the Black Hole of Calcutta and
the Spanish Inquisition pale into insignificance.
Andrew Fisher should make a deal for this old
fraud, and send her to the bottom of the deep, daik
ocean before she fills any more people with utterly
wrong ideas about modern Australia.
♦
It looks as if the all-in stage of the European
disturbance is going to be reached by so
short a cut that before many weeks have
passed the question will not be who are
taking part, but who are out of it. In
that event Uncle Sam will find it harder to
discover a neutral than to send the Crown
Prince a barrel of pickled pork. Italy,
hitherto torn between a desire for the
present profits of peace and the future
profits of plunder, seems likely now to make
up her mind, and, by plunging into the aigu-
ment with a bayonet, to make things even
more lively than they are for the old gentle-
man who lives at Vienna —if he lives any-
where. There has already been a mild col-
lision between Italian and Austrian troops,
and the seizure, of large shipments of goods
consigned from over-sea to Austria and Crei-
many. Also rumors which may be reliable, or,
on the other hand, may be entitled to great
disrespect, are floating about of the Rou-
manians and Italians being ready to fall
simultaneously across their respective fron-
tiers. Should this take place, then refer-
ences to “the Front” will be to a mighty
circle of steel corralling up the whole family
of variegated Huns, who, if what is printed
as news be only approximately true, are
beginning to regard one another with the
eye of dark suspicion. Meanwhile the
battle rages with fury and persistence on
the Franco-Belgian lines, where the Allies
are more than holding their own ; and from
the Carpathians the Austrians are said to
be again falling back before the Russian
hosts' and dropping into Hungary. All this
was stated long ago and may again turn
out to be mere moonshine; but as no news
comes to hand of any marked German suc-
cess, the probability is that the Allies are
at last successfully sitting on the enemy s
chest. In the Dardanelles the lurk has
managed to hit back again with a torpedo,
but, generally speaking, the campaign there,
as elsewhere, is uainfully obscure.
H. G. Wells on the moral of it:—
The Battle of Mons —when the British Army, in
the wrong place and the wrong quantity, and with-
out sufficient machine guns and aeroplanes, covered
itself with glory in a losing fight—was lost upon
the playing grounds of Eton.
One of the few cheerful incidents of the
collision which was suffered the other morn-
ing by the Melbourne-Sydney express was the
characteristic comment of a more or less dis-
tinguished American passenger. “A very
small thing,” he told the reporters, disparag-
ingly, “compared with what we have in the
States.” It sounded almost as though, at
home, they had an officer to arrange such
things in a fitting manner. A Chief Colli-
sioner, probably.
George Black, N.S.W. Chief Secretary,
writes with reference to recent criticism of
a beef purchase on behalf of Britain :
One reason for the price seeming higher than that
paid for local supplies is that from all meat taken
over by the State Government for the Imperial
Government the brisket, flanks and shins are cut off.
ln this direction there is a loss of about 101 b.
per carcase. These trimmings are practically value-
less.
Yet the Govt, lately went to the expense of
having literature printed showing how valu-
able these valueless shins and briskets are
for “workers’ dinners.” Moreover, as the
Chief Sec. says he has “not the time to cal-
culate the difference between the cost of car-
cases bought in the rough and carcases
placed in refrigerating chambers ready for
shipment,” it looks as if the business ivas
carried through in the dark.
The baker’s dozen of Federal Parliamen-
tarians who were aboard the Melbourne
express which rushed into the stationary
Temora mail at Binalong (N.S.W.), early
on Saturday morning, haven’t been heard
complaining about their luck since. Just for
once Postmaster-General Spence and Joe
Cook were on the point of going into the
same lobby, and this time it was one where
privileges don’t matter. One passenger
was fatally injured and about a score
gathered themselves together with _ minor
damages. Senator McDougall had his nose
cut, but a piece of sticking-plaster put that
right, and he was able to wander into Syd-
ney Stadium in the evening to see if a couple
of pugs could more successfully keep what
they smell with out of the firing-line. The
mishap at Binalong appears to have been
robbed of its potential tragedy through the
north-bound express having had to slow down
while crossing a bridge just before reaching
the point of collision. Of course there is
the usual demand to know whether the infre-
quent accidents can’t be prevented altogether.
To which the only reply possible is that they
can be —as soon as ever the railways can
find men who are always infallible, and can
hire them for eight or nine shillings a day.

Allen Doone’s experiment of trying a sam-
ple of Uncle Sam’s cheap comedy on his
faithful Irish-Australian followers was com-
menced on Saturday at the Palace (Sydney),
and “Ochone!” and “Hell to its sowl! was
all the reward he got—and about all 100
Much Johnson” deserves. He be the
foine, upstanding dispenser uv untroots
to announce it as “the greatest farce-
comedy of the age” ! If it has any
merits (which is doubtful) they are
not brought to light by the players.
Doone and co. present the piece without any
evident acumen, and the audience is left to
get its money’s worth out of the dialogue.
And, if you plaze, here’s a sample of the dia-
logue : “My dear sir, you don’t suppose”
“Oh, yes, I often do —more often than fre-
quently” “You don’t know what to do if
a lady faints.” “No ; I don’t.” “There you
are. Well, don’t do it.” This to constant
feeders from Doone’s hand of the ould sim-
plicities and melodies of such plays as “Barry
of Ballymoore” and “The Wearin’ of the
Green.” Ochone! Of course, there is no
reason why Doone shouldn’t try himself out
in another line of work occasionally, but the
more occasionally he does it the better. And
ragtime comedy work ought to be scored out
entirely.

The revival of “The Man on the Box,” at
the Little Theatre, Sydney, emphasises the
loss the Violet Paget company has suffered
in the departure of Hugh Buckler. Gerald
K. Souper, excellent character-actor as he
is, is not the irrepressible U.S. comedian-hero
required for the part of the young lieutenant
who pretends to be a coachman. His work is,
as always, conscientious; but he lacks the
Niblo touch, though in his serious intervals
he gives the character a genuine dignity.

Violet Paget has a character that quite suits
her skilled methods; and the support by the
rest of the company is fairly efficient. The
innocuous comedy amuses.
Those who had seen Robert Parker only
in Wagnerian parts were as surprised at
his first Sydney concert on Saturday night
as some others had been 18 months ago
when he came out in flannels and a smooth
young face to sing in “Madame Butterfly.
But if he is no longer a robustious bearded
warrior he is still the owner of a great
baritone voice which even a Wagnerian
orchestra can’t drown. One cannot say
anything more greatly to the credit of the
singer than that the wonderfully powerful
“The Time is Past” lost nothing by trans-
ference to the concert platform. Entirely
satisfactory support is given by Mrs. Car-
men Harris, formerly one of the Pinschof-
Wiedemann girls of Melbourne, and the
child Scapini, whose violin-playing does
more than give promise. As accompanist
Harold Whittle was in complete sympathy
with his soloist —as he always is when he
has the right kind of soloist. The third
concert of the series will be given this
(Thursday) night.

tion, and make good for honorable mention.

Compared with the blood-and-bedroom
dramas of Andersonian tradition, the ancient
farcical comedy “Confusion” is an insipid
dish to set before the King’s (Melb.). It
is as though an audience, hungering for a
pound of steak and onions, was confronted
with a poached egg. Yet quite a good speci-
men of its own obsolete sort of entertain-
ment is Derrick’s “Confusion,” wherein the
parlormaid and the butler are the owners of
a lawful baby, and the newly-married mis-
sus smuggles a bull-terrier pup into the
household with the connivance of Uncle
Blizzard, and the pup and the baby become
twin causes of those cheap and artless mis-
understandings which account for the old,
old foolishness of everybody thinking every-
body else must be mad. The false assump-
tion of lunacy was still a novelty in farci-
cal complication when “Confusion” was born
to the stage; but much repetition has worn
the nap off it. The comedy throughout is
rather flabby, and measured by the ordinary
standard its brevity exceeds the limit. In
fact, although the decent old thing is in-
teresting as a curio, the multitude, for the
most part, calls it “rather pussy,” and the
multitude happens to be right. Whereas poor
“Bill Adams” was positively puerile, the
well-constructed “Confusion” is merely
“pussy.” All the same, a capable co. can
get some wholesome laughs out of it. Maggie
Knight and Harry Paulton, jun., as a
pining spinster and a stodgy stage uncle,
score most. Carleton Stuart, who has to work
hard in the part of a reasonable husband
suffering from ridiculous suspicions, is
abetted in the third act by Charles Brown.
Ethel Buckley is coupled with A. Albert in
the baby episodes. Miss Macpherson is an
easy, unaffected, unimpressive wife who can’t
understand that marriage is not all hugs
and honeymoon; and Herbert Ford is coupled
with a young lady who cuts no ice to speak
of.

“Lady Godiva” is now rattling the bones
of the old legend to make a Melbourne holi-
day. In the Princess’s story, however, the
fair female does not exhibit her contours
merely for the purpose of saving Coventry
from the tax-gatherer. Rather her ride is
tendered as proof of her chastity, previously
impugned by the evil fibs of. the bogus earl
of Northumbria. This nefarious idler wants
to add Godiva to his other belongings, and
tries to annex her in her nightie by drug-
ging the supper-beer of her serving man
and pinching the keys of her sleeping apart-
ment. Also he attempts to incinerate the
lady’s supposed lover, in reality her sister’s
secret canoodler; and later he endeavors to
finish oil her famous undress parade with a
crudely-devised bridge sensation.. But all
his schemes are ruined by a witless park
dosser called Tom o’ Coventry, who plays
a hero’s part by outing Northumbria in
favor of the rightful heir and restoring
Godiva to the confidence of her fat-headed
husband. Tom, who is eventually blinded
in belated respect to the legend, is pre-
sented by Fred Kehoe as a melancholy fugi-
tive from Bedlam watching over Godiva
with the dumb devotion of a dorg. Miss
Oriel Hotson is Lady Godiva, and sumptu-
ous fleshings hidden under a Niagara of pale
hair make her renowned ride a picture
which any church journal could publish.

chuckle and a defeated snarl as the fraudu-

Shaw perversely classed “The Philan-
derer” among his Unpleasant Plays, so he
alone is to blame if it hasn’t been a com-
mercial success, as popular as (say) “Can-
dida.” Thqse who read him know it for
light, amusing comedy, and as played by
Adelaide Repertory Theatre it went with a
ripple throughout. Its chief drawback now-
adays is that it “dates” itself so emphatic-
ally as of the ’9o’s, when for men and
women to. meet in a club was a subject: for
joke, and Ibsen still stood as the dreaded
symbol for Advanced Thought. “The new
humor,” too, was a phrase of that day,
coined by such as Gilbert, Burnand and
Byron for the younger school. The before-
mentioned club was “a (ow place ; the women
members smoke, and earn their own living.”
It is impossible to take seriously a play in
which it is uncertain till curtain-fall which
of three women—all on the stage together
—the hero will marry. Of the three, Beryl
Kook scored best, as the girl who is pas-
sionate, in both senses. Zoe Reid, though
intelligent as ever, has been seen to much
greater advantage; and Kitty Sullivan (a
recruit), though she spoke the lines of the
“manly” voung woman well enough, had the
odd drawback of looking too girlishly pretty
for the part. Among the men, James
Anderson and Arthur Smith did good char-
acter-work ns the two shocked and bewil-
dered fathers. Douglas Walsh had all the
“fat” as the philanderer. It is half sheer
lying, half appalling candor—what London
calls a Hawtrey part—and he made the
most of it.

From Adelaide Royal, manager Stewart
has taken the Gilbert and Sullivan Co. west,
with still more west (South Africa) in
prospect. Patronage in Adelaide was
astonishingly big. Gladys Moncrieff and
Pearl Ladd alternated leading parts amic-
ably ; . Walenn showed himself a sound
humorist, though he shouldn’t clown when
other people are singing; Villiers Arnold
made some small narts stand out by ouaint
posturing; and Ethel Morrison resolutely
neglected the difficult task of making her-
self look old and ugly enough for the parts
Gilbert unsportingly makes fun out of. At
the Tivoli, the temporary season has been
so successful that manager Crawford .is
continuing it. But the popular pink Dan-
dies are in their last outdoor evenings.
These party politicians with their press
agents are worse than the stage favorite who
howls for limelight. A week or two ago
the air was filled with talk about the prodi-
gious labors of Carmichael in making the
system of public instruction in N. S. Wales
the most up-to-date on the face of the earth.
The new Minister (Griffith) now comes
along to sav that it is a good thing the De-
partment has secured such a vigorous admin-
istrator as himself, because it is at least a
quarter of a century behind the times.
AT POVERTY POINT.
F. G. Samson writes: Henri Herault,
late manager for Path# Frbres in Aus-
tralia, has been killed in action in
France. As soon as war broke out,
Herault, though married but a short
time previously to the daughter of one
of the most respected members of the French
colony in Sydney, packed up and left for the
Front. On arrival in France he got an
attack of pneumonia, and was laid up in a
military hospital until the middle of Febru-
ary. So it must have been in his first
battle that he met his fate. In the moving-
picture world he will be deeply regretted;
most of the camera men now operating in
Australia learnt their work from him. Pre-
vious to coming to Australia as member of
an expedition fitted out by Pathfis to illus-
trate life and customs in the Northern
Pacific he had visited well-nigh every capital
in Europe with his camera.
“Pen”: Received the “call” at Ballarat,
Anna Gould, the last of the Golden City’s
veteran pros., aged 80. A handsome woman
in her day, clever and decidedly popular—so
old Ballarat speaks of her. At the
Charlie Napier Theatre in the ’6o’s she was
playing “lead” in “Time Tries All,” and
drifted too near the footlights. Her clothing
was suddenly ablaze. Tom King sprang
from his place as leader of the orchestra;
Dr. Roseman followed, and between them
they beat out the fire. The player was little
damaged, and within a few weeks she was
married to Roseman. So tragedy became
romance. But soon it was tragedy again—
Dr. Roseman suicided, for a reason not avail-
able at the time. His widow married T.
Coombe, Town Clerk of Ballarat. Soon he
died, and Anna Gould had once more to
return to the “boards,” where she played
small parts till the early ’Bo’s.
Every theatrical gossiper knows that the
veteran Walter Bentley is the son of a
Scotchbyterian parson (Begg), but it was
never generally known that L. J. Lohr, the
popular showman of old, is another link
between the Church and the Stage. The
register of a Brighton (Melb.) church re-
cords the fact that in August, 1885. Lewis
John, youngest son of the Rev. Charles
Lohr, rector of Alborg-Harleston, Norfolk,
England, married Kate Alice, youngest
daughter of the late Tom Bishop, Philadel-
phia (U.S.A.). The success of Marie Lohr
in “sweet simplicity” parts is accounted
for. Her mother, Kate Bishop, was an
actress who excelled in the artless, angelic
line of character; and “Daddy” Lohr was
the son of a peaceful country rector.
The most remarkable theatrical show that
ever happened in Victoria was given in
1857 by “Bill” Iloskins at Hepburn (near
Daylesford), where the Jim Crow diggings
were then booming. Hoskins had a small
co. at Castlemaine, when a pub proprietor
from Hepburn came along and engaged him
to give one consecutive performance on satis-
factory terms. Hoskins was to get all the
receipts without any deductions whatever,
on a guarantee of a £75 minimum. The
only stipulation was that the advt. posters
should be printed in English, French and
Italian. Conveyances were provided gratis,
and on a Sunday night Mr. and Mrs. Hos-
kins and the co. arrived at Jim Crow —or
Hepburn. The only building in the place
was a store and pub combined, with a
blacksmith’s forge and butcher’s shop at-
tached, so Hoskins wondered where the
audience was to come from. But next
night the one building was besieged with
miners, each bearing a candle stuck in a
bottle. The forge was the stage end of the
theatre and the store the auditorium. The
miners packed the floor and perched on the
cross beams. After the performance they
had a wild spree, and next day Hoskins de-
parted with a vote of thanks, a few nuggets
and over £lOO in cash. That was 58 years
ago. The village of Hepburn to-day con-
sists of a State school and about 20 habita-
tions all told. One might sweep the Jim
Crow. ranges thereabouts with shrapnel and
not kill anything more human than a goat.
“Fax”: Mention of Marcus Clarke’s
widow (Marion Dunn) having played in
“Confusion” when it was first produced in
Melbourne, reminds me that she had then but
recently gone back to the stage. She retired
on her marriage, and did not get many
engagements after she returned. As a mat-
ter of fact she was never the popular actress
that vague reminiscencers have said she was.
Father John Dunn (born O’Donoghue)
ranked as a good comedian of the old-
fashioned sort, and sister Rosa Dunn, who
married L. L. Lewis, was a prime favorite ;
but Marion amounted only to “a worthy re-
presentative of the family name.” A fairly
pretty girl, with an early stage training
which made her efficient in burlesque and
comedy, she lacked the natural gift of mum-
mery. The same want of dramatic instinct
is apparent in her daughter, Marion Marcus
Clarke, now acting in the Niblo company.
“Midchannel”: The musing of “Masetto”
(B. 4/3/’l5) concerning Verdi and Wagner
discloses a distinct vacuum in his musical
learning. Verdi is as much indebted to
Wagner as “Bellerive” is to Byron. Any
Bulletin contributor who attends a series
of ops. by Wagner and Verdi, and is able
to detect sufficient similarity between them
to establish an indebtedness, is something
of a genius, or worse. With Wagner the
great task of the orchestra is to hold itself
sufficiently in check to give the singers a
chance of being heard. With Verdi one has
to look with a microscope for the instrumen-
talists, who just make enough sound to save
themselves being overlooked. Verdi .was a
slave to melody, and hadn’t quite grasped
the meaning of orchestration, or had very
little time or use for it, except in “Aida,”
“Otello” and “Ernani;” With Wagner, ex-
cept for an occasional slice of melody, the
orchestra is boss of the show and a very
heavy and wearisome boss at that. To be
able to pick out a spice of melody in a
thunderclap is a rare accomplishment, but to
detect a vein of resemblance between the
formidable Wagner and the light and airy
Verdi is a rarer one. The most brilliant ex-
ponent of orchestration plus melody is
Puccini. Possibly “Masetto” will file a bill
against this composer on behalf of Vogner.
N.S.W. Attorney-General Hall is a proud
man. He announces with a scream of joy
that he made £17,000 out of the Wheat Grab.
Asked who had the money he chuckled that
he knew who hadn’t got it—the middlemen.
Tiie Bulletin knows somebody else who
hasn’t got it —the farmers.
All the Dukes and Earls and Rothschilds
who were supposed to be quite small frag-
ments of the mighty Norton Griffiths Co.
■ fell out of the business in a heap the other
day. When the negotiations were still in
suspense nothing less than an Earl or sim-
ilar potentate was represented as chairman
of directors. Now the gentleman who
is representative of the concern in Aus-
tralia says the firm consists of one man,
Norton Griffiths, known as “Empire .Tack.”
The local representative’s name is Mayoh;
and the last time that name was before the
public it was in connection with a scheme
—which failed—to get the public to put up
enough money to build a pier and dancing-
hall at Manly. The dancing-hall may have
been part of the great movement towards
Empire solidarity, for which Mr. Norton
Griffiths has done so much.
A Sydney man has reached newspaper
notice through having been 50 years a bread-
carter, the last 21 years spent on the same
run. He doesn’t appear to have any ideas
of value about the war; but on the subject
of arbitration he has a word or two to say
to Those who often denounce it. Fourteen
years ago bread-carters received 365. a week
for covering a full run and doing odd jobs
in the bakehouse as well. Their hours of
toil were unlimited, except when some gen-
erous employer insisted that his hands
shouldn’t work more than 24 hours a day.
Then a union was formed, and arbitration
assisted it to get better conditions—in fact,
arbitration was the inducement to form the
union. The men got a wage of £2 ss. and
working hours were limited to 10. Now the
lowest wage is £2 12s. 6d. and the hours are
nine ; and the bread-carters seem to be ever-
lastingly explaining that there will be no
delivery to-morrow on account of some holi-
day or other.
Last week-end the Federal House of Reps,
closed with a riot about certain proposed
increases of salary to Parliamentary officials
and civil servants. The disturbance started
over a proposed rise for one man from £9OO
to £lOOO a year, but the total amount in-
volved is over £6OOO. It transpired that
the estimates now before the House were
compiled by Cook and adopted bv Fisher,
who waved aside as trifling the objections
raised to these advances. In the affairs of
a nation £6OOO a year is not much as an
ordinary thing, but in the face of a falling
revenue and the adoption of rather desperate
devices to keep going on even the old scale,
it becomes a matter of importance. If this
sum is officially regarded as of no consequence
in one direction it is likely to be similarly
regarded in others, and the multiplication of
6000 by a hundred or two may be disas-
trous. The Commonwealth is not in such a
position that it can regard thousands as tray-
bits. If it is, it ought to be ashamed of
itself for sponging on harassed John Bull
to the extent of £28,000,000 in one year.

THE MICROBE OF OBESITY
CONQUERED AT LAST.
(EXTRACT FROM THE “DOCTOR
AND HIS FAMILY.”)
“Reductions of from one to two stone of
excessive fat in a few weeks’ time, and final
reduction to normal weight of extremely
fleshy persons, were reported at a recent
medical conference, when the subject of
obesity was discussed. The remarkable
effects obtained are attributed chiefly, to the
use of salith leaves, taken from sea pi an Is.
Their action increases the supply of oxygen
in the blood, and''thus consumes the excessive
fat. Physicians present . attached special
significance to the fact that by this sii ole
vegetable treatment, strength and yigor r.ve
greatly increased instead of being diminish :1.
Furthermore, the skin and tissues undergo
a natural contraction while the weight is
being reduced, so that no flabbiness ensues.
The use bf toxic drugs or weakening diets
was condemned as dangerous and undesir-
able. Any person suffering 1 from obesity
can easily get rid of excessive fat by obtain-
ing from a chemist about an ounce of
salith' leaves, and taking two before- each
meal. A noticeable , reduction >in iveight
takes place within a week cr 10 days.]’
P.S.—The final report evidently means the
final and complete, destruction of thej much
discussed microbe of obesity,*
SOCIETY
“De Yid” swears it’s a true bill: —
What a thinking animal is the female of the
species! One of her walked into the Adelaide Post
Office the other day to despatch a parcel to the
usual boy in Egypt. The official took it, weighed
it and asked the usual question regarding the con-
tents. The lady dimpled delightfully. “Oh, if
you must know, it’s just half a dozen fresh eggs.”
“But. we can’t forward perishables all that way,”
he gasped. She assured him that they wouldn’t
smash, as she’d packed them in wadding. “You
see,” she added, “Charlie’s been ill and in hospital,
and mother and I thought it would be so nice for
him to have a few fresh eggs.”
The commercial travellers who have been
holding an inter-State conference in Brisbane
gasped when one of their number proposed co-
operative buying of spirits, tobacco, cigars
and other creature comforts for the C.T.
clubs in all six States. To men who thrive
by the multiplicity of commissions the sug-
gestion was like a punch from a snowball.
The assurance that club expenses would be
brought down with a run by this purchasing
in bulk was only like heaping coals on the
fire. As a principle of political economy
co-operation was well enough, but applied to
working-day practice there was too little
money in it from the commission-grubber’s
point of view. And Victoria, which had the
temerity to fling the bombshell on to the
conference table, bowed its diminished head
before the remonstrances of four sister
States. “This threatens our very existence,”
tearfully pleaded president Bowcher, and
the “Hqar, hears” were like the sound of a
grand !
A note from a man who had just finished
the washing-up: —
II the overworked idea of the street collection
perishes of insufficient nourishment after this war,
the few sane people left will heave the biggest sigh
of relief. First there .was Hospital : Saturday ; then
Wattle Day came with another crowd of “helpers”
and social advertisers. Then, lately, in quick succes-
sion, the city, which represents a. State.cracked by
drought, was afflicted with Belgian Flag Day and
Rose Day. The motive behind it all is good; but
the total cash result is wretchedly poor for the
boots, motor tyres and cheek expended. What annoys
the thinking citizen is that, while real work goes
begging, there never seems to be any lack of
“assistants” when the job consists of running about
the streets from early morn to late afternoon rattling
collection-boxes in the faces of strange men. But
let a weary house-mother advertise that she is pre-
pared to pay good wages and supply first-class hoard
and lodging to anyone who will help with the home
and kids, and she is lucky if she gets an application
from one she-autocrat, If the lady-beggars really
want to boost the patriotic funds, let them hire
out their affability and boundless energy in the little
homes where there is real women’s work, and pour
their wages into the charitable coffers. Certainly it
might cause complications at the Trades Hall; but
before Mary Ann could make an effective protest,
she would have to prove that she really existed and
was ready to sign on.
Tlie University of California lias been
raking together statistics of the weight? of
infants coming to light in Britain, Australia
and the U.S. The average at birth of 247
males born in the Commonwealth was
127.30 z., and that of 234 females 121.20 z.
One thousand males born in the Lambeth
Hospital (London) averaged 113.80 z., and
1000 females 113.20 z. The usual weight of
little Stars and Stripes is 120.50 z. and of
sister 115.70 z. All of which adds to the
proof of the deterioration of the Bullpup
breed in the climate of Australia.
“Bloggs” : Where is Truth? In the lead-
ing columns of the dailies you read that
Germany is on the verge of insolvency.
Meat is short, likewise bread. ■ The wealthy
classes are leaving for Denmark, Norway
and other neutral countries in order to
lighten the strain on the local supply of
necessaries. The most fantastic devices are
in use to maintain the importation of
petrol and rubber. These articles come in,
in small quantities, via Barcelona and
Switzerland, on whose German borders they
are collusively stolen by the Kaiser’s emis-
saries. The picture of want and despera-
tion is impressive, and it is presented about
six times weekly. Yet last Saturday,
tucked away in a corner of one of the
same dailies, was this:—
A motor-car exhibition has just been opened in
the largest hall in the world, erected on the Kaiser-
damm in Berlin. According to the Tagliche Runds-
chau, 8000 electric lamps of 300,000-candle power
. are required to illuminate this great building.
If it is true that Berlin is staging such a
motor-car exhibition after nine months of
war —well, it’s a long, long way to Potsdam.
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER FACES.
BLACK S ISTER (to troublesome piccaninny): “Now, yo go way, or granny'll call white-
fellow in to eat you."
ART AND THE HIGH COST OF LIVING.
FRIEND (lost in admiration of transcendent genius): “What a gift!"
ARTIST: “No blooming fear! Drop it! That's a £50 order!"
“Mariner”: As a precaution during war
time, the Admiralty inaugurated an “exami-
nation service” at all “defended ports” in
the Empire. For the third time this year
the examining steamer at Sydney has col-
lided violently with a vessel which was
being bailed up. All the bumps have
occurred between the Heads, and the one
last week nearly sent both vessels to the
bottom. Devout seamen bound to Sydney
nowadays chant the following litany before
grog: “From lightning and tempest, from
shipwreck and sudden death, from Germans
and the examination steamer, good Lord
deliver us.”
George Black, the new Chief Secretary of
N. S. Wales, has succeeded in his advocacy
of the claims of the Sydney street speaker,
and Holman announces that nobody will be
prosecuted who keeps his oratory in reason-
able check and doesn’t disorganise the tram
service. This seems only decent in the light
of the fact that citizens who can’t speak in
public, and haven’t any ideas to express, if
they could, are allowed to wander as slowly
as ruminating cows along the city pavements
and hold up anybody who really has busi-
ness to do. This aimless street-mooching on
the part of well-dressed loafers might very
well be regulated. Any person under 40
who walked in the street at less than three
miles an hour should do so only between the
tram rails. There might be a mess in the
middle of the streets for a day or two, but
the new rule would smarten up wonderfully
any loafers who were left.
Up Inverell (N.S.W.) way lately a fettler
was on night duty at a bridge undergoing
repairs, his job being to signal trains
to slow down while crossing. Trains were
scarce during that shift, and it was a long,
dreary wait for the first —the mail. The
monotonous cacophony of the frogs in the
creek made the man drowsy ; so he impro-
vised a bunk from bags and sundries close
up to the line and arranged an alarm to
awaken him in time to signal the train. In
due course the- alarm sprang—m—m—m—
rattle—bang. . . .But the sleeper didn’t hear.
The medical man said death was quite in-
stantaneous. The watcher had gone to sleep
with his head on the rail, confident that the
vibration of the approaching train would
alarm him in time. Eternity held the road
that trip.
Adelaide has woke to the fact that its
- chief hospital is altogether out of date, and
a deputation last week asked the new
Government to rebuild. Tinkering with the
present buildings, it is urged, would be false
economy. The statement was freely made
that many private hospitals in the city are
better equipped. Chief Secretary Styles
agreed offhand that something big must be
done, but to “scrap” all the big pile stand-
ing is a heavy order. The hospital has
the benefit of a Martin bequest. Half of
this money is in leased property, which
should be of much larger value shortly; but
about £32,000 cash is in hand, and this is
offered to the Government for a start. A
new and thoroughly up-to-date place might,-
however, cost anything from ' : £200,000 up-
wards ; and S. Australia hasn’t yet con-
tracted Holman’s habit of waving a lordly
hand and saying: “Do the thing properly!”
trusting to luck to find the money.
THE OLD STOCKMAN’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AVrop me up in me stockwhip and blanket,
And bury me deep down below,
AVhere this piffle and sham won’t disgust me,
In the land where the coolibahs grow ;
For I’ve stayed with some well-to-do people,
And I’ve dined with some middle-class folk;
And I’ve sorrowed by clock-tower and steeple
Till my heart for the Commonwealth’s broke.
They have flown in another direction,
AVho ured to clack-clack by the hour
Of “this awful, un-British Protection,”
Of “our dear friend the member in power,”
And the Higher Religion for Dossers, .
And the Need of an Object for Drunks.
Now they’re all of them Red or Blue Crossers,
AA’ith their tails sticking out of their trunks.
There are citified Martins in dozens—
The Darling' Point Martins the pick—•
Who used to be horrified cousins
Of a Martin we knew as “Mad Mick.”
He is hanging out somewhere where French is;
And they heard he’d enlisted —somehow.
It would paralyse Mick in the trenches
To know how he’s glorified now.
You remember the George Henry Crosses?
They’ve packed up twelve trunks in despair.
He’s the boss of the back-station bosses,
-And Ernie’s the son and the heir.
He .has never put hands on a wether,
Nor heard a pithed store-bullock grunt;
So they’re taking the mailboat to England
To guard Ernie safe to the Front.
And each of the war-going, parsons
, Costs many a heart-breaking tear —-
Dike that caddish young cub of old Carson’s,
All found and four hundred a year.
He feels not a word that he preaches,
But he won’t be criticised there;
As he drones, where the flying shell screeches,
Poor Tommy will shiver and swear.
“Our relatives, too” (plague the Censor!)
Each girl has a tear on her cheek.
Cousin Roger has gone as dispenser
(Expenses and three pounds, a week.
More risky than listening to sermons,
. As some of our fellows will find,
In a fierce fortnight’s fight with the Germans
In front —and with Roger behind!)
And the girls, they are writing like blazes,
And Auntie is moaning like H—•;
And -I wish I was under the daisies—
Or the cowdung would do just as well.
So I want to be wropped in me blanket,
- And buried down- —deep down —below ;
AVhere this cant and this cackle won’t reach me—
In the land where the coolibahs grow.

Australia’s hi ghwa y m e n—i nclu d in g thoso
who lie in wait in the warehouses —have
covered themselves with glory. Edwin
Smith, of Adelaide, the president of the
whole body, lately offered £lOO to each
State towards a motor-ambulance. The
drummers in each of the six States got busy
and found the other £4OO. In fact, they
overdid it, and together subscribed enough
tor seven, which will accordingly go to the
hront as the offering of Australia’s bagmen.
From London
another Australian episcopal hat is circulating
here in London, Rockhampton had no sooner de-
parted than Kalgo'orlie .arrived, Kalgoorlie, whose
.-other name is Gokliug-Bird, makes a pitiful appeal
for monetary help to keep his, shovel-hat above water.
He has to bish. 310,000 square miles of Westralia,
the transcontinental raihvqv passes through his dio-
cese, a thousand men are working upon its construc-
tion, most of them have families, itjntJ “owing to
lack of funds” the Church of Eriglamt can do nothing
for them. “Not a single parish or district in the
diocese is self-supporting” he says; hut lie, does not
explain how it is that the R.C.’s, the Presbyterians,
the Methodists and other religious bodies are able
to finance their op< rations ■without sending round the
humiliating hat in Bhllbpolis; Finally, the Bishop
of Kalgoorlie seeks to evoke British sympathy and
cheques by dwelling on the distressful ebullition of
Young Australia:—
many centres children are growing bp with
little or no knowledge 6f the elements of Christianity,
the social and moral problems are peculiarly great
owing to climatic and- other reasons.” , * A
What is the good of sending High Commissioners,
Agents-General and immigration lecturers 40 England
when bishops also are suffered to come here and
publicly proclaim Australia to be one'of the most
poverty-stricken and God-forsaken spots on the sur-
face of this planet ?

"OK.”: A lot of old playgoers were look-
toi ‘ an aw ful calamity of some sort.
Lney couldn’t believe that Providence would
let a decadent world
go on getting, more
decadent. It was
ragtime, tango teas,
turkey trots and
bunny bugs that did
it. tChe ugly inani-
ties and indecencies
of nigger dissipation
had been foisted Upon
white "civilisation, and
white civilisation had
adopted them as new
developments in art.
All things considered,
Butcher William
seems to have been
quite justified in as-
suming; that the cue
for Slaughter was
given to him by Gott.
It doesn’t follow that
Gott intended militar-
ism to win; but He
probably meant it to
turn the nations from
tango dances and rag-
time tunes. Tango
is dead ; ragtime music
is not yet extermi-
nated. So the war
goes on. As long as
there’s a “High Jinks”
bn the Williamson
stage, or a Monte
Wolf to shout in rag-
time strain at the
Tivoli, so long will
this country be re-
quired to send contin-
gents to the war. Rag-
time has got to be
wiped away with
blood, and it is the
irony of fate which
decrees that the U.S.A., the birthplace
of. ragantango, shall stand out of the, san-
guinary transaction. Providence always
tempers the inevitable with strange
omissions.
SYMPATHY:
SMITH: “I see by the paper that poor devil Brown with the large family has another
youngster to support. Darned nuisance that sort of thing must be."
JONES: “Darned nuisance! I'll wager that motherly little soul of a wife of his does
not call it that.”
SMITH: “ Oh , I dunno! I don 't suppose she’s read the advt. yet!”
The French ships Chateaubriand and
General de Sonis have been faithful com-
panions in misfortune. Two years ago both
went ashore on the South Aus. coast within
three months of each other. Both were
refloated, towed to Melbourne, and docked
there./ And now both have been finally dis-
posed of within a few days of each other
by German pirate submarines.

“Letusee”: Re “Jermyn Street” and his
remarks on French wines being denied the
unlucky German from now henceforth and
for ever more, I sco ff. For the past 50
years the great weinhandlers of Austro-
S U nffLV V V" p P lied France with about
50 pei cent, of those velvet clarets,” deli-
cious hocks and dry champagnes, the Rheis-
ivbf\ a “ d T ° ther nes of delicate flavors, of
which _ Jermyn Street” has such loving
memories. The consumption of wine in
Euiope long ago outran the possible output
ot h rencli vignerons, who, being wise, would
not spoil their markets by putting out im-
mature stock; so they had recourse to im-
portation from the communal weinhandlers
or Austro-Hungary, who have too much
respect for the grape to send poor stock out
or the country If Australia would only
adopt their methods we might hope for wines
or the same quality. The peasant grower
who owns from a half to an acre of land,
has his own little press. He takes his must
to the communal cellars, or to private cel-
lars more rarely, and has it tested by three
experts, sometimes four. On their reports
the grower is paid—according to quality. A
prize is given annually to the grower who
brings in the best must. No matter how
gieat and how influential the weinhandler
may be, his vats, cellars and distilleries are
liable to surprise visits, and the Law keeps
its eye skinned to detect any adulteration,
any lack of cleanliness, or any marketing
of immature juice. In several of the great
cellars doors still bear unbroken the Govern-
ment seal set upon them at the time of the
I lanco-Prussian war. If the Common-
wealth had the interests of this industry
at heart it would follow suit and seal up
cellars at the conclusion of each harvest,
and keep, them sealed for periods varying
from four to 10 years.
‘Coot”: Why keep the Australian bantams
back? Sir S. Pembrey, lecturer on physi-
ology at Guy’s Hospital, London, recently
shattered the big-man idol into many frag-
ments. He declares that small men make
the more efficient soldiers, for the following
reasons:—-
The essential organs are in the head and the
trunk, and these are often better developed in the
short than in the tall man, the weight of the brain
being relatively greater in the short man, and the
reaction .time not so long. Tall men of full • pro-
portions are heavy and often slow, and there are
strong physiological reasons for the greater agility
and activity of the small man, who does not Suffer
from the mechanical disadvantages of Height and
weight. The small man has a greater capacity for
work and endurance, and has stronger resistance to
disease.
Anyhow, nothing is surer than that the
attempt to measure up the qualities of people
of different countries by the same physical
standard is idiotic. The wire and-whipcord
man of Queensland may have no “chest”
worth mentioning; but lie could >put most
tubbier Englishmen to bed after a tough
day’s work.
“Y.Z.”: In Collins-street, Melbourne,
on an afternoon of last week a man
chased another about 20yds. along the
block, and smote him violently on the
hat. The man whose chapeau was
assaulted turned suddenly, whereupon the
assailant bashed him on the nose. Consterna-
tion and curiosity in the face of the man
who had been attacked gave way to plain
annoyance, and lie drew off, and butted his
left against the aggressor’s jaw, knocking
out a parcel of teeth. The teeth slid across
the ..pavement, and remained with No. I’s
hat in the gutter, grinning vacantly. No. 1
tried to- cross No. 2; No. 2 blocked, and
coming in with his knee up fouled No. 1
awfully.., The. gasp No. 1 gave when that
knee shifted his wind was like the cough of
a dying horse. No. 2 was still busy. He
tyas 'a brisk in-fighter, and a neat hdok put
No'.- I- down. No. 2 went down with him,
and proceeded to press his advantage home.
He punched No. I with all his hands ; then,
gathering in the ears of the man :| under,
rapped his head smartly on the pavement.
Every moment I expected to hear something
give. . Among the spectators during most of
this time was a tallish fair lady, the most
composed of all. She waited till" No. 2 had
rapped No. I’s head nine times. Then she
placed a gloved hand on No. I’s shoulder. “Ex-
cuse me,” she said sweetly, “but you are the
wrong man.” No. 1 looked at her in some
confusion for a moment. “Oh, am I?” he
said with some diffidence. “I am sure I beg
your pardon.” “Not at all,” said the lady,
“my mistake.” Then No. 1 gathered up his
hat and went on, and several kindly people
took up No. 2 and his teeth, and bore him
into a chemist’s shop.
INEXPENSIVE.
MRS. JONES: “Oh, I think your frock is
lovely. Did it cost you viuch? ”
MRS. SMITH: “Only one good cry."
The Clerks’ Union of Australia has been
talking about it for a long time, and now
seriously threatens to haul the employers
to the Federal Arbitration Court. At one
time the N. S. Wales Union , was a large
and energetic body, with a prospect of doing
many things; but there was a cabal which
took charge and wrecked the show so badly
that it only recently got off the rocks. The
unions in Victoria and Westralia have been
the only ones so far able to score an award.
The Victorians got a minimum wage of 565.
prescribed for a 48-hour week; but they
intend to ask now for 755. for a week of 38
hours. All the States’ unions are linked
up ; but that alone won’t get over the main
difficulty, which will be to satisfy the Court
that there is a Federal dispute.
A SONG OF THANKSGIVING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Our servant is going-
She’s leaving next week!
Her bragging, her blowing,
Her loafing - , her cheek,
Her pre-nuptial sewing,
Her sneers and her pique,
Had driven us dotty.
A problem too knotty
At last she became, and we just had to speak !
Our servant is going—
She’s leaving next week.
Our servant is leaving; '
We’ve sacked her at last!
You bet we’re not grieving,
No flag’s at half-mast;
Her fine trousseau weaving
We stopped with one blast.
She called the place “rotten,”
And bit at her cotton ;
She mumbled “Good riddance!” and sewed
very fast—-
Our tyrant is leaving,
The crisis is past!

Frederick Halcomb, M.A., Clerk of the
8. Aus. Parliament, maintains the tradition
that Parliamentary officials live long. He
was born in Wiltshire 79 years ago, gradu-
ated at Oxford, and became Parliamentary
librarian at Adelaide 45 years back. When
the late E. G. Blackmore was appointed
Clerk of the Commonwealth Parliaments, in
3901. Halcomb stepped up to his present
billet.
“Vegetarian”: I saw it reported that
.T. H. Mclntosh, recently killed by natives
of the Lakekamu River district (Papua),
was cooked and eaten. This is incorrect.
Poor Mclntosh was decapitated by three
savages for loot, and his body was left on
the ground,
where it was
found by some
other natives
and buried. Can-
nibalism is com-
mon in many
of the remote
inland parts of
the country, but
not so in
the mountains
where this mur-
der occurred.
Mclntosh was
one of the clev-
erest prospectors
amongst the
callable Austra-
lians here, and
had the largest
copper mine
thus far un-
earthed in the
Territory— the
Laloki. With
only a few sav-
ages for corn-
pan y, some
tinned stuff, a
pick, shovel and
dish, l:e would
wander through
the worst of
hostile highlands
on the quest
for metal. And
when lie had
found it he
mostly gave it
away to some-
body down on
his luck.

Henry Thomas, who came of an enterprising
family. liis grandfather was killed at Tra-
falgar ; his father went down in the Erebus

himself was wounded at Sebastopol (Crimea)

in 1860, and had 55 years of peace, anyhow.
Ricciotti Garibaldi, at one time truant
officer of the Victorian Education Depart-
ment, was in London a month ago seeking
to raise £240,000 to equip a Garibaldian
legion to fight with the French. Says Ric-
ciotti : “You cannot conceive the stimulating
effect of 30,000 red shirts on the field of
battle. They will arouse the imagination of
the Southerners and make their warm blood
tingle. We must have them —the men and
the shirts. I shall wear a red shirt myself.
I am condemned to crutches, but I am unite
comfortable on horseback. I refuse to grow

“Darbalara” (William Burton) Smith, a
well-known N. S. Wales squatter, who died
recently in a private hospital, was eldest
son of William Kempton Smith, of Bon-
gongo, for many years manager of Ur.
Nicholson’s runs in Iliverina. The last
property W. Iv. Smith owned was Darba-
lara, in the Gundagai district, which
passed some 45 years ago to the son, who
retained it till 190(5. lie was one of the
oldest members of the Union Club, founded
in the ’so’s, and of the A..J.C.
The Peacock Government has one virtue,
at any rate: it appoints Australians instead
of importing alleged experts from abroad.
The Chief Commissioner of Railways was
so selected, and now, irrigation expert
Elwood Mead having resigned, senior com-
missioner Cattanach steps into his shoes.
The new chief was originally a bank clerk,
and then town clerk at Flemington and
Essendon; and he knows most about the
financial side of irrigation and closer settle-
ment. But as Mead was one of the State’s
few successful importations, Cattanach 1 as

departments of the business.
“Chasuble” : Exit Bishop Moorhouse. He
found that the Victorian diocese had got
mouldy under Bishop Perry, who had
arrived in 1847 by the ship Stag, about the
same time as the R.C. Bishop Goold c-ame
overland from Sydney in his carriage with
four horses. Both were of the conservative
order. Carr’s energising after Goold was
like Moorhouse’s after Perry. The first
thing that disgusted Moorhouse _ was St.
James’s wretched cathedral, with its pepper-
caster tower. Forthwith he determined on
a new fane. First ensued a struggle over
the site. Perry had stupidly fixed the
Cathedral to be in aristocratic East Mel-
bourne. Moorhouse at once said it must be
at St. Paul’s, in the thick of Melbourne
traffic. lie had not only to lick the
East Melbourne barrackers, but also those
who wanted the Cathedral at St. Peter’s,
cheek-by-jowl with St. Patrick’s, on that
hill. He won ; yet without Baronet Clarke
and Ormond, tiie Presbyterian, he would
have fared much less well. Ilis foundation
of Trinity College, under Deeper, is trium-
phant, too, for it has already turned out six
bishops —Green of Ballarat, Armstrong of
Wangaratta. Stretch of Newcastle, Long of
Bathurst, Sadleir'of Maoriland, and Stephen
of Hobart. In manner Moorhouse was
Napoleonic and not beloved by the clergy.
But what of that if he could command their
obedience? And he could do that and more:
he even attracted Kent formerly of the
Congregationals, and Bailhache from the
Baptists; and in Kent’s case it was after
that preacher had attacked Moorhouse s
High Churchism.
From “Tlie Oldest Inhabitant”: —
1 think Mrs. Isabella Gorman, who died at Potts
Point on March 26, was the oldest living native of
N. S. Wales. A daughter of the late William
Johnston, who, with his wife, arrived in Sydney
from Scotland in August, 1817, she was born in
Sydney on July 30, 1819. In the following year
Johnston was appointed manager of the Government
farm at Bathurst and crossed the Mountains with
his family. In 1840 daughter Isabella married John
Gorman, a surveyor, afterwards a partner of T. S.
Mort’s, the founder of the Australian frozen-meat
business.
Harold Perdriau, who died the other
day in Sydney, was 50 years ago appren-
ticed to Mort’s Dock, and then joined his
father, who was the pioneer of the Balmain
steam ferry service. Later lie became a
partner in the Balmain ferries with his
brother Henry, the founder years later of
the Perdriau Rubber Co. On the ferries
being taken over by a company, Harold
Perdriau established an engineering works
with Mr. T. West. They purchased the
enormous punt that had been used in plac-
ing the spans of the Hawkesbury Bridge in
position, had it towed to Sydney and con-
verted it into a floating dock, now known as
Drake’s. In later years lie was foreman at
the Clyde works, and retired from that din
only a few months ago.
The just-dead Bishop Moorliouse spent
10 of his 89 years of life in Melbourne—
-1876-8o—and0 —and then left to become Bishop of
Manchester. A yarn told of his early days
in Victoria started in a railway carriage.
A wealthy Western squatter invited the
Bishop to stay with him during a pastoral
visitation of those parts, and Dr. Moor-
house accepted. He left Melbourne in one
of the old oblong saloon carriages, seats
all round. At Geelong a noisy lot of
squatters got in. The Bishop was obscured
by an open newspaper. The sheep and
cattle men were vigorous in language, so
vigorous that the tall, silent figure in the
corner rustled his newspaper to call “order,”
as it were. The western men were abashed
when they discovered the Gaiters, and the
squatter to whose house he was proceeding
introduced himself and apologised for the
“language.” “You know, my Lord,” he said,
“in this part of the country we call a spade
a spade.” “Do you?” said Moorliouse. “I
would have thought you called it a •
shovel.” He was no wowser. He smoked a
pipe, played a first-class game of billiards,
promenaded with a well-bred bulldog at his
heels, and had a tiff with his Synod once
because he invited a well-known actor to give
Shakspearian readings in the drawing-room
at Bishopscourt. A coincidence relating to
the first three Bishops of Melbourne
Perry, Moorhouse and Field Flowers Goe—
is that each, though married, was childless.

CLARENCE GOODE, Minister of Lands in
the new S. Ans. Government.
The mystery of the last will and testa-
ment of Nordica, the singer, is to be probed
at Thursday Island by a special U.S. Com-
missioner. who is the American vice-consul
in Melbourne. Nordica’s second will, dated
1914, is said to have been drawn up during
her stay at Thursday Island, and it differs
so strangely from her original will, dated
1910, that the U.S. Court has decided to
give the previous document a chance. In
1910 Nordica bequeathed all her £lOO,OOO
estate to her husbahd, but at Thursday
Island she cut him off with a small rever-
sion, or something, though they were writ-
ing loving letters to one another all the
time of her concert tour. Hubby therefore
is now battling for probate of the first will,
whilst his wife’s relatives are hanging on
to will No. 2. Vice-consul llartlett is in-
structed to examine witnesses who are
said to have been present when Mrs. Nor-
dica changed the destination of her dollars.
But he may find the position complicated
by the fact that the doctor who could best
certify to the lady’s state of health at the
time was so unreasonable as to die of blood-
poisoning the other day.

known figure in Launceston died. tie
went to his father’s funeral on a bund ay.
But his hands were still not free lie

funeral, young Itussen had a quiet wedding.
The next day was Wednesday, and that

Returning to Sydney he was carried into
Parliament on the first big Labor wave. But
he did not like Parliament half as much as he
thought he would. Labor-in-politics was

This co. was formed primarily to take over
the moving-picture connection of the Tait
brethren in Victoria. Subsequently it pur-
chased the Australian rights in the kinema-
color film process and also acquired inter-
ests in various Victorian picture shows, the
idea being to make the “circuit” which every
amusement caterer nowadays aims at. But
the more money the Taits and other Aus-
tralian managers made by these and other
economies and devices the more the film-
makers wanted from them. The Australian
managers, presently got tired of bidding
against one another for the benefit of the
foreigners, and formed what is known as*the
Combine —really two cos., one to hire films
out; the other to show films. Amalgamated
Pictures, Ltd., threw itself into this Com-
bine. It sold its plant, etc., for shares and
debentures in the two Combine cos., and it
leased its theatres to them. It received
43,808 fl shares in each of the cos. That
was so much more than the book value of
the assets handed over that, in order to
adjust matters, those assets had to be in-
flated with hot air, as shown in the middle
of the table. For that reason the nominal
reserves of £07,190 needn’t be regarded very
seriously. As nearly as The Bulletin can
make out the hot air represents £67,616;
and, as that may be accepted as at any rate
approximately correct, it is also fairly cer-
tain that there are no real reserves at all
—or none worth mentioning. In other
words, the tangible assets are only about
sufficient to represent the capital.
Put it this way. Amalgamated Pictures’
liabilities are £15,956. Cash and book debts
(chiefly, of course, dividends uncollected
from the Combine cos. or advances made to
them) amount to £16,446. So the capital
is represented by a surplus of £490 of liquid
assets and by freeholds and leaseholds
valued at £40,052; leaving £32,168 to be
represented by the shares in the Com-
bine cos., debentures issued by them
(£11,718). and shares in subsidiary
cos. at Northcote, Moonee Ponds and
Geelong (face value £3700). Of the
more substantial part of the assets —the
£40,052 represented by real property—no
less than £31.597 is leasehold (the Majestic
Theatre). No doubt a great deal of this
value is practically goodwill, too. In other
words, if the bottom fell out of the picture
business most of the £31.597 would escape,
as well as most if not all of the value of the
goodwill of the Combine cos. and the sub-
sidiary cos. Meantime the profits are all
right. Had it been permissible they could
have paid 15 p.c. all round last year; and
then one doesn’t know how much profit the
Combine cos. made in excess of the dividends
they actually paid to this and other cos. Nor
is there any visible reason for expecting
that the corpulent profits will drop out of
the business. Certainly there will be keener
competition: but the fact that the keenest
competition is going to be felt in Melbourne
won’t affect this co. particularly, since the
Combine is inter-State. though the Taits’
own ventures were all Victorian.
Harking back to the leasehold, a sinking
fund is provided to amortise this asset.
Apparently £4OO a year is bitten out of
profits. It is invested in the picture busi-
ness, which seems the only imprudent thing
about the transaction.

When the co. was formed late in 1911 the
chief question to consider was whether the
assets were overvalued. “Steamships,
lighters and hulks, properties, plant, stocks
and stores” were said to be worth £680,653.
This apparently was the valuation of the
vendors; anyway, so far as the prospectus
disclosed, nobody else committed himself to
figures. On the basis of that valuation the
surplus of assets was £751.404. which the
present co. paid for with 375.000 cumulative
pref. shares and 375,000 ordinaries, all of
£1 fully paid. The public took 125,000
profs, and 125,000 ordinaries. Even on this
capital of £1.000,000, and assuming that the
extra £250,000 got in on flotation would not
earn anything, the average certified profits
for the previous five years held out much
comfort to the new shareholders. After
writing 6 p.c. p.a. off for depreciation of
vessels at their cost, and after excluding in-
terest paid on borrowed money, Troup, Har-
wood and Co. said the proprietary had been
averaging £71,713 —just enough to pay 8 p.c.
on the ordinaries after giving the prefs. their
6 p.c. But though the public put up
£250,000, which allowed the co. to repay
nearly £200,000 of deposits, besides reducing
other liabilities, the profits haven’t in the
past two years reached anything like the cer-
tified average. And even the profits set
out in the table may be overstated. Any-
way, £2746 of the profit for the past year
is really an addition to the Insurance Fund;
and an insurance fund may be anything—-
an accumulation against a risk still current,
or a stocking to drop redundant Fat into.
Huddart Parker haven’t got so much redun-
dant fat that they should want to hide any
of it.
The reserves credited in the table are:
Formal reserve. £4502 : insurance, £23.6->5;
undivided profit. £11,062; total. £39,219.
Besides that there is a reserve “for contin-
gencies. depreciation of properties and shares
in other cos., repairs and maintenance,
boilers and renewals, superannuation fund,
etc.” Its total was £30,507 twelve months
ago. Now it is £3(5,185, or £5678 more.
The object of thus lumping things —of mix-
ing up a superannuation fund with a fund
for renewals —is of course to prevent the
public ascertaining definitely what the co.’s
position is. But this a t least can be said;
if £5678 is all the provision made for meet-
ing 12 months’ wear and tear, as well as
providing for contingencies and a super-
annuation fund, then the bite out of the
profits isn’t any too much. On the published
figures, and granting that depreciation may
possibly have been written off direct (though
there is no trace of it anywhere), The
Bulletin should say that the true profit for
the year was substantially less rather than
more than £60,460.
Considering the capital employed, this is a
distinctly poor result. One or two things
can, however, be said in extenuation. The
co. has been putting into ships a lot of
money which has beeii dead for most of the
year. This comparison will show the 12
months’ changes in assets: —

The co. also during the year took a hand in
floating the Hebburn Coal Co., and matters
have been unsettled in connection with that
property and the whole Newcastle trade.
The removal of these disturbing factors will
doubtless improve things. On the other
hand the co. most likely paid too much for
the old ship and other property. Further,
the certified average profit was for a period
when earnings had increased phenom-
enally. but expenses had not been
pushed up to correspond. Since 1912
wages, etc., have been overtaking the
tremendous rise in profits which
occurred, generally, between 1905 and that
year. The profits —still speaking generally
—for the latter part of the neriod were there-
fore quite fictitious: they had bolted ahead
of costs. The very awkward thing for those
who bought on that fictitious basis is that,
when the tide of prosperity runs out, as it
has been running out lately, costs won’t im-
mediately readjust themselves. They will
for 'a time be too high just as before they
were too low.

The Caledonian Coal Co., formed in 1895,
acquired sooner or later the AVest AA r allsend,
West Wallseud Extended, AVaratah, Aber-
dare and Aberdare Extended collieries at
Newcastle (N.S.W.). It was a Scotch con-
cern, into which the Howard Smith Co.
bought whenever the chance offered: and
that co. was also the managing agent in
Australia. Eventually Howard Smith’s
secured all the shares; whereupon Cale-
donian Collieries, Ltd., was formed with a
paid capital of £852,507 in 252,500 8 p.c.
cumulative pref. shares and 600,007 ordi-
naries. The Howard Smith Co. took the
ordinaries and 192,500 prefs. ; and the How-
ard Smith Co. shareholders individually
applied for 50,000, and were subsequently
allowed to have another 50.000 at Is. pre-
mium. The first balance-sheet, published a
year ago, showed a profit of £79,721 “after
providing for depreciation, amortisation and
preliminary expenses.” The total of the
preliminary exes, wasn’t mentioned; but
whatever it was it is plain, that, assuming
enough was written off against the wear and
tear of plant and wastage of the mining
property, the true net profit was more than
£79.721. The jump made by the past year’s
profit wasn't therefore as great as it looks —
again assuming that the writing-off was done
on the same basis in the two years. What
depreciation and other allowances were made
isn’t even remotely hinted at. All that can
be said on that point is that on Howard
Smith’s past record the amounts written off
are likely to be very ample, and the declared
profit is likely to understate the truth rather
than overstate it. Assuming that just
enough was struck off gross profits to. meet
all proper charges, then the year’s net profit
was equal to 134 p.c. on the ordinary shares,
after providing for the prefs. That the co.,
which had exceptional means of judging,
believed the nroperties were not overvalued
to begin with, and that they would yield
very large profits in excess of the pref
requirements, is fairly clear from t lie fact
that it was satisfied to hold no less than
£OOO,OOO of the capital in ordinary stock.
The area held by the Caledonian Co. just
before the transfer was 8025 acres of free-
hold and 9231 acres of leasehold; and pre-
sumably the present co. holds no less. The
financial position is very easy: liquid assets
exceed the liabilities.

The profit depends on the stocktaking; and
though there may be something wrong with
that in -one year, or even for three or four
years, it is almost inconceivable that any-
thing should be very wrong over a long
series of years. So it may be taken for
granted that Ivempthorne, Prosser & Co.
make, year in and year out, a comfortable
7 p.c., with a fair margin over after provid-
ing probably for all reasonable contingen-
cies. What provision actually is made The
Bulletin doesn’t know to a pound; but
there are signs that this is the sort of co.
which provides for all it can see or think of,
and then whips a bit up its sleeve to provide
for the things it can’t see or think of. For
instance, there is a reserve on customers’
accounts —a fund which has been standing
there for years to meet any extra bad luck in
the way of uncollectable debts. As it has
stood just where it is now for 10 years past,
it is plain that all the current bad debts
have been met, not out of the fund, but out

In the 10 years £09,456 of new capital and

£77,755. All the extensions made during
the 10 years have been paid for out of that
money and the undivided profit; for, as
shown above, the debt to the public has been
actually reduced. And very fine extensions
there have been. Close up £50.000 must
have been put into the new Auckland acid
works alone —and, with the quick develop-
ment of agriculture handy to Auckland,
radiating from the State College and demon-
stration farm at Hamilton, there ought to
be a big future for that industry. We really
haven’t started to use chemical fertilisers in
Australasia yet; and Maoriland, with its
larger rainfall, will find them more valuable
even than the cockies over the Common-
wealth side.

Skinners, Ltd. (Melbourne). —As plainly
indicated at the time the prospectus was
issued, this co. should never have been
formed —at any rate, on the basis submitted.
The late Henry Skinner had carried on a
catering business, and for the goodwill and
a trifle of substantial assets no less than
£25,000 was paid in shares as well as an
utterly ridiculous £16,500 in cash. The good-
will was obviously worth hardly anything:
the man who had made the business was
dead, and it was almost wholly a catering-
connection which was liable to be lost at any
time. This actually happened. The direc-
tors say :
Mr. Henry Greville entered into competition with
the co., and secured much of the work and contracts
previously carried out by the late Henry Skinner,
M.L.C., whose business the co. acquired. In order
to meet this competition prices had to be cut, pre-
miums increased, and many more hands employed
at racecourses and elsewhere.
The co. was beaten almost before it was born,
and sale was compulsory. “The best price
that could be obtained was £25,000 in shares
and £2600 in cash, but of this amount £5OOO
in shares was contingent.” This now is the
position. The public put up £14.146 in cash,
and 25,000 £1 shares were issued to the
vendors and promoters; total, £39,146. To
represent that the co. now has 18.943 shares
in Greville, Ltd. —a co. in 75,000 shares —and
£3182 in book debts (including £2600 cash
to be received from Greville’s). But the
co. owes £9702; so, assuming the Greville
shares are worth 205.. the co. has as its
entire net assets 12,423 shares in Greville’s.
Summed-up:—•
Loss on sale .. .. £18,900
Loss on trading . . 7,823
Balance left (in Greville
shares) .. • ■ 12,423
Total original capital.. £39,146
The monstrous thing is that, of this pom-
little £12,423, representing about a one-sixth
interest in Greville, Ltd., 64 p.c. is owned by
the vendors of the Skinner business and the
promoters or their successors in title. In
other words, all that the public which put up
£13,146 has is 4450 shares in Greville, Ltd.
Later on. they may get a few more shares ;
but that is contingent. Possibly it is use-
less to suggest to the people who got
£16.500 cash and 25.000 shares, mostly for a
business which nearly all melted at once into
thin air, that it would be a fair thing to can-
cel the whole or most of the 25.000 shares ;
but the suggestion is made, all the same.

It wasn’t all war either. For the first seven
months of the year revenue shrank £6<oo;
for the last five months, £I2,DUO. A loss
much greater than £7201 would have been
shown had not the amount spent on upkeep
been cut down further than usual.
The co. has a whole hive of troubles; but
the biggest of all is that the line serves a
mineral area of small or poor mines working
metals which are liable to violent fluctua-
tions. It was the success of the Silverton
(Broken Hill) Tramway Co. which spurred
the public to rush the Emu Bay prospectus
18 or 20 years ago. The crowd judged the
traffic a railway could get by the space the
mines were getting in the daily papers, and
the daily papers were, as usual, giving the
squibs whole columns. That is one trouble.
Another is that the promoters sinfully col-
lared £lOO,OOO in free shares at the start,
which overloaded the concern, and drove it
to get real capital on debentures. The in-
terest on this borrowed money is a first
charge. The third fly in the butter is that
the co. makes use of the Emu Bay and
Mount Bischoff Co.’s railway for part of
the distance covered; and the rent also
comes out before the shareholders have a
bite. Insect No. 4 consists of £lOO,OOO of
8 p.c. pref. capital, of which half (4 p.c.) is
cumulative. For two or three years past
this 4 p.c. has been paid, alohg with some
of the accumulations. Half the balance was
forgiven; the other half was funded, £5OO
to be provided annually towards buying the
“funded certificates.’’ Unfortunately the
paying-out of these dividends skinned the
cash-box, and when trouble came during the
past year the arrangement with the “funded
certificate” holders, though made only a
couple of years ago, had to go overboard,
and the debenture-holders had to go without
their interest. And there is really nothing
substantial on which to hang much hope for
the future. There are scores of mines on
the Tasmanian West Coast; but none that
are known are large, and the largest are
most refractory—-except Bischoff tin ; and
Bischoff tin is not worth much to the rail-
way, because the ore is reduced to metal on
the spot. But the thing will continue luring
people on ; for there is no siren in the world
like a refractory ore mine.

What sum may be properly regarded as
written off is open to discussion ; but, any-
how, the net profit, assuming a fair amount
was struck off against depreciation, was
£2464. This permitted alO p.c. dividend on
the very modest capital, and a rebate of com-
missions ranging from 10 to 20 p.c. The co.,
although it does a little manufacturing, is
mainly in the co-operative marketing busi-
ness. It and the Coastal Farmers have the
bulk of the distributing trade: and this at
least can be said: if they fix the price some-
times higher than the public thinks is a fair
thing, the actual producer benefits —there
isn’t a ravenous middleman scoffing as much
for 10 minutes’ work as the grower gets for
months of toil. Indeed, the butter business
of N. S. Wales is the best-organised of all
the primary industries ; and instead of fling-
ing rocks at the two companies which have
organised the marketing (and to a great
extent also the manufacture), this paper feels
inclined to go down on its marrow-bones and
implore them to take in hand also the fruit
business. Both producers and consumers
would certainly be tens of thousands to the
good every year. As usual, this co.’s liabili-*
ties are not heavy, owing to the excellent
policy of insisting on cash or fortnightly pay-
ments.

The year lias been one of records. Profits
are the largest since the co. was formed;
the amount paid in dividend is the largest;
the lay-by is the smallest since the third
year of the co.’s life. Of a profit of £13,713
only a poor little £l3O is put by to swell the
very small reserves. Further, the amount
required for the 7 p.c. dividend tears along,
and it looks highly probable that profits will
no longer be capable of supporting the very
premature 7 p.c. dividend. The co. was born
in 1807, and consequently doesn’t know
what trouble is. Hence, while other com-
panies which have been through the mill are
piling up reserves, this youngster has been
leading the fast life, satisfied that trouble
could never come its way. Advances on
mortgages, etc., amount to £214,120, so that
ic wouldn’t require a phenomenal slump to
eat up the whole £9883 of reserves.
Advances made last year totalled £46,799,
so there are quite a lot of new risks —-always
the most dangerous—to safeguard. To put
things on a better footing the dividend
should be reduced. And shareholders
should all the more willingly consent to this
because its propriety is mainly due to the
exceptionally rapid increase of business.
White Crystal, Ardlethan, had a meeting
at Ballarat the other day, and the cheerful
chairman “anticipated that they would soon
find the company on the dividend list,”
although the co. has made a hobby of call-
making, and has only “practically £lOOO to
credit after allowing the value of concen-
trates on hand.” A new lease was bought
for £1250, of which £6OO was due on March
1; but as it wasn’t paid and the vendors
now refuse to accept the money, the new
lease represents mostly litigation. The
White Crystal raised £30.000 from the pub-
lic by the sale of 60,000 shares ; yet it actu-
ally started life in debt, and, mostly as a
result, it is going to spend its days in
sorrow.

Great Cobar aoparently is not too anxious
or else is unable to resume operations even
at the present tempting price of copper.
When giving evidence in support of an appli-
cation for suspension of labor on the co.’s
Cobar Gold and Chesney leases in the begin-
ning of March, Hogan Taylor, the mana-
ger, handed round a nicely type-written
synopsis of operations which he intended to
carry out as soon as money became available.
All looked very nice on paper, and Bill the
Shaftman spent 6d. on a pint and looked
hopefully ahead for an early resumption of
wages. But up to the present nothing
new has happened. When money was
available, Taylor said, their intentions
were to put five men on Cobar Gold
Mine, 30 on Chesney, and 120 on Great Cobar
for about three months, and after that he
anticipated having sufficient men on to raise
and treat approximately 1000 tons Cobar
Gold, 300 tons Chesney and 4500 tons of
Great Cobar ore per week. Just before sus-
pension expired in the latter end of last
February, a cable was received from London
to the effect that Tellew Harvey’s recom-
mendations had been accepted, and permis-
sion of the English Court would be obtained
to enable the mines to reopen. Since then
apparently all hands have gone to sleep, and
Great Cobar has been forgotten. The local
management says it is in possession of no
now facts, so when suspension is applied for
again in a few weeks the Mines Department
might hint that it is about time somebody
woke up and did something.
Vegetable Creek (N.S.W.) is becoming a
bit of a favorite with some punters who
fancy tin shares. It has been badly handi-
capped by its debt to the landlord; but it
has a fair chance of paying dividends in
the long run —if the tin market holds. Any
concern with a large capital or share
market value and a small output of say 200
or 300 tons of tin oxide a year is a gamble
depending on high prices.
Some suspicious mining flotations are now
being attempted in Westralia. Here is the
latest. Gibraltar: Nominal capital. £30.000
in 60,000 shares of 10s. 45.000 are offered
to the public on payment of ss. per share
and balance in calls. Owners’ price, £(>000,
plus £3500 and 15,000 fully paid shares
to present option holders. And for what?
A few coarse gold specimens from an un-
developed claim in the vicinity of Bulla-
bulling. where shoots hitherto worked have
failed at a shallow depth and where capital
has already a little graveyard. There are
other flotations equally as impudent round
about Westonia.

Black Range West (W.A.) is stated to
have got through the erosseotirse at No. 3
level and to be on the look-out for the reef
at that point. Meantime a 2d. call has been
made, and shareholders are being buoyed up
with the prospect of good values being
struck in the crosscut.
An Oroya Links circular issued in Lon-
don last month reckoned that as a result
of last year’s work the ore reserves in the
Eclipse lease show an increase of 30.(100
tons of ore 3d. higher in grade than the 1013
ore. A good body of oxidised stuff is stated
to have been opened up in the adjoining
Golden Eagle block.

The latest W.A. show to be introduced
to Melbourne is the May Queen. As (he
name betokens, it lies in the Yllgarn field,
but a long way from the Edna. As far as
quality goes the mine may he all right. It
has doled out 010 tons of 2|oz. stuff. But
it has taken 205 ft. of sinking on the under-
lie to yield up that little bit of treasure.
It looks as if the May Queen ought, to have
been left to bewitch a prospector’s party
rather than to flaunt on Stock Exchange
steps. A. J. Mac George’s report points
that way, too. All he gives to the reef now
being worked is 700 tons for each 100 ft.
sunk, with a profit of say £3500 for each
lift. This is a lot more than bread and
butter to a working party, but it is small
potatoes for a company. Something bigger
may come from the parallel reefs, but if
these are O.K. why haven’t they been
developed before?

From one of the most experienced mining
men in Westralia :
In many—l believe it is safe to say, most —in-
stances the shows at Westonia are being worked to
suit the Melbourne and Adelaide market operators,
among whom are some of the directors. This is
nothing short of rascality. If it plays with this fire
the public must get its fingers burned in the end.
* * * *
“Izzat”: From Port Davey (Tas.) a pro-
spector has brought to Hobart about 2cwt.
of fresh bitumen found, he alleges, on the
banks of the Deep River, which debouches
into one of the arms of Port Davey. The
bitumen is of fine quality, and the prospector
says “there’s acres of it,” Unlike the bitu-
men found on the coasts of Victoria and
South Aus., this Port Davey stuff is de-
scribed as found up a river miles from the
ocean,- and above a bar across the mouth of
the river. If this is true the ancient reason
for the existence of bitumen on the coast
from Cape Otway to Eucla, that "it has been
brought in by oceanic currents from some
far away place,” will not do duty. Almost
simultaneously finds of bitumen have been
reported from Recherche Bay, south west of
Hobart, between South Cape and D’Entre-
casteaux Channel. W. H. Twelvetrees,
Government Geologist, has been engaged for
ten weeks examining the district between
Catamaran and the New River, and he in-
tends eventually to work his way north-west
to Port Davey. The region is comparatively
unknown, and Twelvetree’s report will be of
more than ordinary interest.
Almost simultaneously with the reported
finding of bitumen at Deep River near Port
Davey and New River (Tas.) comes word
that Dr. Wade, the oil expert, spent three
weeks at Ilailton and Latrobe, and thinks
very well of the quality and quantity of
the shale beds. The Ilailton-Latrobe Shale
Co. now owns the oil areas and works of
the defunct Tasmanian Shale and Oil Co.,
which was killed by poor management. The
works and leases were bought for a song.
Mount Lyell has spun through another
half-year and its latest return —725 tons of
blister in four weeks —suggests that it pro-
duced 4000 tons for the six months to the
end of March. The outlook is very cheerful.
The management is continually improving
the equipment, and very solid progress has
been made in opening up a fine ore body
at 1100 ft. and preparing to crosscut from
a winze at 1200 ft. But as low prices were
obtained for copper in October and Novem-
ber, and the economy of electric power has
hardly had time to prove itself, it would be
unreasonable to expect very big profits for
the period just closed. During the last 12
weeks for which figures are available, costs
must have been cut into considerably. In
that time 1522 tons copper were produced
from 76,979 tons ore and secondary pro-
ducts. This means that the furnaces re-
quired slightly less than 43 tons of crude ore
to produce a ton of metal.
Toora tin. Southern Gippsland, has passed
into the hands of the Court on the action of
a machinery-man. London spent a heap of
cash in assembling there one of the biggest
individual sluicing plants deposited on Aus-
tralian drifts, but jibbed at a last payment.
So unless Tom Birkbeck gets Toora into
the embrace of a more persistent crowd, the
Toora virgin tin drifts will have to remain
to tempt a new generation of mining sports.
The St. Aignan’s first report, for the nine
months to the end of January, doesn’t carry
conviction that the mine is worth the
£lOO,OOO which the owners are understood to
be willing to sell it for. The property is on
11 isima Island, off Papua, and is part of the
same low-grade body that Broken Hill Block
10 is working under option. The ore body is
said to he anything from 10ft. to 230 ft. wide,
and to average 80ft., and the stuff can be
shot down for a few pence per ton. So far,
2780 tons have been treated. The manager
says “the average value of the lode is about
Sdwt., and runs from 14s. to 60s. per ton” ;
but the actual extraction ran only from
9s. Id. for 605 tons (taken from the surface
down to lift.) to 15s. (a lot of 515 tons taken
100 ft. lower down). The tailings are worth
from 2idwt. downwards. The mine has a
mill and cyaniding plant; but as some of it
was only lately set going, the term doesn’t
show a profit. The mine is now self-support-
ing, the manager says; but that’s no good to
shareholders. The report doesn’t make it
clear whether the lode has been yet systemati-
cally sampled; and on that everything de-
fends, seeing that at best the margin over
costs can’t be very wide —probably not enough
to allow of much picking and choosing of ore.
Interesting things are happening in con-
nection with Malay tin-mining in which
Australia is largely interested. Austral-
Mala.v Tin, Ltd., a Sydney concern, joined
some London people in floating the Kamun-
ting. Shortly afterwards it floated on its
own account in Australia the Kampong
Kamunting and Larut cos. The Ivamunt-
ing has one big dredge, which has just been
put to work. The earlier hours of a dredge
are devoted, naturally, not to the testing of
the claim, but to the adjustment of the
plant. The Kamunting appears to have
had exceptional luck. Starting on March
22 it was given a run aggregating 117
hours, and saved 10 tons. In the next 181
hours the harvest was 14 tons. Say £2250
worth for 298 hours’ work —excellent, see-
ing that the dredge was merely, so to speak,
trying its ’prentice hand. Kampong had less
luck. Apparently it didn’t happen to start
right off into such good ground, and 105
hours’ preliminary run gave 72cwt., worth
£350. Even this is over 9d. per yard. It
expects to have completed necessary ad-
justments and to start continuous running
within a fortnight. A second dredge is now
being put together. Austral Malay. Ltd.,
is a prospecting and holding co. only. It
is in 20.000 shares, and on December 1 it
held 5000 Kamunting and 8555 Kampong
shares, besides various other interests. The
co. has a good organisation in the Malay
Peninsula and is continuously testing new
areas. One. the Kulim, which looked all
right at first, was recently turned down;
but there are others in hand.
“Lakekainu” reports a movement: —
Dredging for gold is taking on in Papua. The
Yodda Valley Co. has its machine on the track to
the claims, but owing to shortage of labor or some-
thing has called tenders privately for the transport
of boilers and other ironmongery. When the gear
gets on to the wash around the Yodda things ought
to be very bright for the shareholders, but the cart-
ing of heavy boilers and dredge parts over a steep
range will eat up much of the capital. However, it
is a start, and if they get busy and clean a decent
prospect off the plates it might induce some more
of the speculating crowd in Australia to come over
and work the other auriferous rivers, lots of
which are much more get-at-able than the Yodda. A
co., promoted by Charlie Priddle in Brisbane, is
commencing operations on the Lakekamu Flats, and
if there is as much gold there as was won from the
Ironstone and other creeks, it should be a gilt-edged
proposition for the men who are taking the risk. A
dredge will be dragged up the river 72 miles ; thence
it will have to be hauled on trucks and rails to the
scene of operations. It is all flat country, so the
job will not be too much for the strenuous Aus-
tralians who are taking it on. Now that Northern
New Guinea is British the Kaiserin Augusta, Mark-
ham and other large rivers should be an attraction
to the prospector, for they are all known to carry
gold, the few men who went there having turned
these places down owing to the large amount of
German culture they met with.
The Hydes, who worked the Main Ridge
(N.S.W.) alluvial for years before they sold
out to a co. and the short-lived boom
started, are still working the old ground
and making more than a crust. Taken in the
aggregate, there is a tremendous quantity
of gold in the deposit. Practically all the
wash carries metal, and there are miles of
it, ranging from 4ft. to 20ft. thick, assay-
ing probably ldwt. to the ton. Mathematic-
ally it is easy to estimate totals that would
make the hair curl. But present methods
have only proved equal to extracting the
richer portion from the 100 ft. or so
wide of the “lead” itself. Take away
its basalt overburden, and it would he
one of the biggest things on the planet.
Without that, however, there is much gold in
the Main Itidge lead that can be profitably
won, and it probably will not be very long
before a good deal of it is won. A lot of
the richest portion of the lead is still un-
worked, and experienced local men have
belief enough and energy enough to punch
tunnels in after it. They are likely to do
more good than mushroom booms, in which
a, dozen optimistic cos. strenuously await
the results achieved by the only one which
works.
After selling' concentrates and mill resi-
dues, Clark’s, Charters Towers, reckons its
total return from 182 tons at £l7OO. which
averages £lB Os. Sd. per ton. A crushing
worth £2O per ton was previously taken
from this narrow streak of mineral. Since
these old claims have been reopened the
total return has been £7807 from 580 tons.
Clark's was encouraged to make a start in
this locality by its lucky neighbor, the
Papuan Brilliant and Victoria, which has
paid £lO,BOO in dividends from the Moon-
stone and its cross reef. Still. Charters
Towers knows how patchy this Moonstone
locality is, and the local market isn’t nearly
so enthusiastic as when the Brilliant Deeps
struck a rich make of stone.

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, April 19, 1915.
My Dear Arini, —
G.-G. Ferguson will be here to take the
troops’ salute at the end of this week. Mean-
while he bangs his grey hard hitter down
on his brow, and joins the three tourist
Governors at Canberra. Col. Foxton, the
Queensland man who shadows his steps
when the delicate Fane is resting, will see
that no one borrows the Ferguson’s kilts on
the overland trip. Owing to the present
famine in the Help Department, Aide Mul-
holland, of South Australia, will have to
drag three State Governors out of bed o
mornings during their tour round our best
scenery.
The rumor that the G.-G. desired to dig
the King’s School nursery out of old Govern-
ment House at Parramatta and sit there
himself, is said to be a frenzied joke of some
wag unknowm to official circles.
Captain Pasco, R.N., just appointed to
Governor Strickland’s stall, is well known
hereabouts, lie is in charge of the Admi-
ralty Survey work in these waters; —a mat-
ter temporarily shelved by the Big Fight.
As Aide d’Apice was beginning to wilt in
the tracks of so swift-footed a sub-royalty
as Strickland, more help was needed. Young
and dashing bucks of the kind the Society
Miss loves to gaze upon are not to be had
while the row goes on in Europe. So local
Governors have to lay hands on anything
that’s on the sunny side of an old-age pen-
sion. Pasco, who is more than 17, by the
way, is a direct descendant of the signalling
officer who ran up the famous “England
expects that every man” —and so on.
Victorian Governor Stanley and Sir Henry
Galway, of S. Australia, are the guests of
the Stricklands during their trip this way.
Our sub-royalty, with official secretary
Budge, meets the visitors at Albury. _ A
rush to Canberra, Yanco and Burrinjuck
will be wedged into a tour that includes
Jenolan Caves, Duntroon College, and a look
at the naval kids at Jervis Bay. If the
three Governors get back with unbroken
bones, the two visitors will have a few days
at Cranbrook to get their breath and eat
several extensive dinners. The chief feasts
in their honor will be paid for by the Gov-
ernment, the Mayor and the Union Club.
Stanley is a son of Earl Sheffield, the lively
old gentleman who gambolled about during
the 1913 overseas Parliamentary visit to this
State. So he follows in daddy’s footsteps
when he inspects the Canberra dust-holes.
The Strickland family is again scamper-
ing on the lawns of Cranbrook after a
summer airing at Moss Vale. Her Ex. is
said to be better, and the baby, who is a
Westralian, is growing fat and saucy. The
kindergarten rises, as usual, before the milk-
man bangs the side gate or local Society
turns in its first sleep.
The Art Students’ tableaux in the Reper-
tory Theatre were brilliantly produced. The
brothers Clint gave about £lOO worth
of such scene painting as rarely falls to
the lot of an amateur show. “The Awaken-
ing of Australia” was presented in a series
of living pictures, with backgrounds that
were works of art —as scene painting goes.
Florence Rodway, as Mrs. Jason, in “The
Golden Fleece” scene, was a glorious vision
with yellow hair hanging down its _ back,
and two curly-horned rams butting in the
foreground. The book was written by Res
Robinson; the orchestra was made up of
Cyril Monk. Frank Hutchens and Carl
Gotsck. The weak patch was the
living statuary. The statue, who was
mostly dressed in ground rice, got into
position behind a transparent curtain.
Hence the mirth while “The Dying Gladi-
ator” arranged his limbs. In spite of a
wet night the theatre was full, and a goodly
sum for the motor-lorry fund is the result.
The inter-State tennis carnival, which
opened on Friday, had brilliant sunshine for
Saturday’s dash. Outside the playing greens
the ground was, however, still like a wet
sponge, and those who risked a seat near the
lines enjoyed wet feet. N. S._ Wales teams
volleyed awav from competition, and gave
the inter-State visitors a week-end drubbing.
Gate-money, which goes into the Belgian hat,
wasn’t as good as usual for a Saturday after-
noon, in consequence, maybe, of Tatt.’s races.
Governor Strickland and the blue-eyed Eld-
est Daughter, shadowed by a gentleman help,
wriggled in the uncompromising seats that
are like a step-ladder.
Some of our best tennis players are now
in the trenches or crawling out to dry them-
selves in the sun. They include the brothers
Glen and J. .T. Addison, of Victoria. After
explaining these things, Melbourne tennis
visitors remark that they really don’t feel
hurt at being beaten in the present inter-
state rally.
A day or so after Professor Andy Stuart
had told a rather astonished world that the
big Prince Alfred Hospital spends only
about £5 a year in alcohol —including cham-
pagne—there was a quaint notice in the
papers. A score or so city business and
other people were said to have pledged them-
selves to follow the example of the King and
abstain from grog during the war. You
jumped at the list in the hope of finding
something to suggest a Great Renunciation.
There are club men in Sydney who would
miss their 11 o’clock taste, and their appetiser,
and their small bottle at lunch. And when
you turned to find out which of these had
made the sacrifice, to be as much like George
as they are able to be, you find such shock-
ing and notorious tipplers as Archbishop
Wright, little Dr. Arthur and ex-Mayor
Arthur Cocks, who have stuck to milk-and-
soda all their lives, along with a few com-
panies which, being quite impersonal, haven t
a throttle to wet or a soul to save. As
proof of a Great Renunciation the list was
a thorough failure.
Surgeon Phipps, of the A.M.C., whose red
lamp burns at Mosman, will shortly change
his address, and telephone messages sent to
“The Front” may find him—or, again, may
not. Mrs. Phipps goes too; and her address
will pass the Censor. It is London, where
a sister, the wife of Naval-Surgeon Hughes,
lives. The Phipps family mostly swings red
lamps. Father used to write his prescrip-
tions in Manchester; one son is in charge of
a sick bay somewhere in the North Sea,
another is up Brisbane way, and this third
is now packing up his hospital gear.
Beatrice Grimshaw, of the many tales of
the Tropics, is about to transfer herself and
her fountain pen and her typewriter from the
dry belt of Port Moresby, where she has kept
house for the past seven years or so, to
Woodlark Island, where the rain it rainetli
255 days in the year, and the gauge records
a fathom of wetness per annum. In the
mountains, BO miles or so out of Papua’s
capital, the writer-lady grows spices and
such-like garden produce, and the present
move is being made to a cocoanut patch two
days away from the old home.
The John Hughes family, which inhabited
Rockleigh Grange, North Sydney, until it
was acquired as a mia-mia for his Grace
Cerretti of Corinth, is now located in the
new Gregory Toohey chalet on Cremorne
Point, where the view is just as good but
different.
Dr. David Thomas, the Manly surgeon and
potentate of the local cottage hospital, left
last week with his medical son and his wife.
All three expect to get busy behind the
trenches. Mrs. Thomas —a sister of Dr.
Hetlierington, of Burwood —was a nurse in
her younger day; and when her medical son
had to undergo lately an operation, she
partly in pity for an overworked staff —re-
joined her old brigade at the hospital. Her
best wish now is to be given work alongside
her husband and son.
Maitland Levy, the eldest offspring of
the Sep Levys, departed last week to offer
his services to Kitchener. A Iveigwin
youth travels with him and also prays to
have a shot at the Huns.
Mr. Carson, of the big wool firm, is
making a holiday trip to the North Island
of Maoriland. Like a thoughtful husband,
he took his wife with him. The glacier
season in the South Island is now drawing
to a frozen end. The last Australian tour-
ists to make a dash to Mount Cook are the
William Little couple, of Pymble. After
doing the usual fancy steps on the Tasman
Glacier they will catch the final car from
that frost-bitten address on April 29. In
the Little party are the Donald Mackays
and Miss D. Griffiths.
The Swedish Consul, Yon Goes, a large,
smiling person of exuberant hospitality,
gave a gorgeous lunch at the Australia to
the departing ’Murkan Consul Bray. Every-
thing was gilt-edged—from the menus to
the cards that indicated the table address
of each guest. A total abstainer —or next
door to it —of my acquaintance could only
mourn, amongst the ashes of a big cigar,
that he was unable to appreciate the old
French wines present. Premier Ilolman,
of the P.L.L. chain, was in lively vein,
and Consul Chayet —escaped from the dirge-
like duties of patriotic teas —was also a
very cheerful man.
Captain Gordon Finlayson, a son of David
of that ilk—dad was formerly manager of
the Union Bank in Melbourne—has been
handed the D.S.O. for his services in France.
Gordon, who belongs to the Royal Horse
Artillery, married Maisie Richmond, who
belonged to a wool-growing family.
Poor Marjorie Micliie, who married Bel-
field Woollcombe, the Maorilander who was
killed in the Singapore mutiny, was still
wearing her trousseau finery when she was
included in the death-roll. The wedding was
to have taken place in the Dominion. But
when the top blew off the world’s peace the
knot was hastily tied in England, as the
’groom had to pack up for Singapore.
Mrs. Phillips- Fox has gone to join her
artist hubby in Melbourne. We Avill pro-
bably see them both in this hamlet in five or
six weeks.
An Australian dinner in Calcutta was
eaten lately at the Dalhousie Institute.
Padre Birch, Garrison sky-pilot at Fort
William, gave the toast of the evening,
“Australia.” Father Birch served as a
kangaroo soldier in the South African
squabble, and then joined the black-coat
throng. A Westralian named Gutmann
rounded off a column of remarks _ with
honeyed comments on Gibson Carmichael,
formerly Excellency of Victoria, and now
the just-as-popular Governor of Bengal. The
spread is to be an annual fixture.
The fete for the Waitara Foundling Hospi-
tal will be opened on Wednesday of next
week in the sub-regal presence.
The youngsters’ pageant in the Norland
College grounds ought to push a cosy cheque
into the Belgian coffers. Dr. Grace Boelke
stood at the receipt of custom at the front
gate, and Mrs. Greig-Smitli rounded up the
kiddies for the antics in historic fancy-garb.
Mr. Locke, a Broome pearl-fishing potentate,
gave the first prize—a pearl brooch. It went
to a lady Viking. Maisie Greig-Smitli, as
Margaret Tudor, was to have been awarded
first, but mamma stonily refused to let her
have the gaud, so she took a meek second
place. Mrs. Hugh Ward, who had promised
to do the judging, arrived late but intact,
after a series of minor motor mishaps such
as are generally dealt out to the Best Girl in
the movies.
A week or so ahead of the carnival, fay-
like Doris Waterhouse, of Burwood, who
had booked herself to be a Norland nurse
and then consented to a more permanent
engagement, was married to Dr. Hugh Bay-
son. After their honeymooning they went
out to heal the afflictions of Nyngan.
• The Alexandra Hospital committee can
rely on a very wet day for its annual meet-
ing. So the prevailing golosh last week was
quite in order. Instead of serving up the
accounts in the open the authorities had to
hustle as much of the company as possible
into a long thin room, while the overflow
took up a commanding position round re-
freshment tables on the verandahs. The war
seems to have miraculously opened hitherto-
closed purses. At any rate, the most
astounding figures which secretary Moss
poured over the proceedings showed that,
after a year of greatly increased expendi-
ture, the institution’s income still exceeded
its bills. Dr. Clubbe, in dilating on
these glad tidings, threw a bouquet
at the public, which had contributed two-
thirds of the cash. Mayor Richards handed
over a cheque for £lBOO from the Dolls’ Car-
nival ; also a second slip of paper for £7OO
or so, the result of the Willie Cooper dame’s
raid on country hamlets.
Ruth Morton, a daughter of Philip, is
engaged to Russell Keigwin, of the Orme-
Iveigwin whisky firm. As you have heard,
young Keigwin left the other day to per-
sonally help Our Cause in France. _ This
engagement has been mentioned in whispers
for some months. JS/oio it’s safe to breathe
it through a megaphone.
Dr. F. G. Stephens, the spectacled young
man from Rose Bay who went off to the
islands on the hospital ship Grantala, re-
turned engaged to one of the nursing staff.
Now he is wed —the knot was tied on Satur-
day—and the Nightingale who was _ Sister
Burtinshaw of Prince Alfred Hospital is
Mrs. Stephens.
Noel Bridges, a son of the Major-General
who is in charge of the first Australian
expedition, is in camp (or was a few weeks
ago) with a British regiment at Aylesbury.
His peace-time billet was in the Land Sur-
vey Department in the Malay States.
The Red Cross Carnival in the Stadium
brought in about £lOOO. The quaintest item
was the boxing schoolboy-competition.
Blindfolded they hammered the air or an
adjacent juvenile nose, to the great joy of
everyone but the organ’s owner. A plump
lady named Sadie, in scarlet satin tunic and
short breeches, showed us how K overthrow
a Bad Man in a jiu-jitsu argument. Woman,
who is, as a rule, not fond of boxing con-
tests, watched the joyful sparring match
between the Belgian Demlin and Dave
Smith without any inclination to scream for
help. J. J. Corbett sauntered on to auction
King Albert’s picture, but the canvas had to
be put to bed again for lack of high bids.
The drawing of an art union, with Mrs.
Hugh Mclntosh amongst those responsible
for pulling out the numbers, was the chief
event of the show.
After baritone Parker’s huge voice had
rolled round the Town Hall on Saturday
evening, there were thunders of applause.
Without the beard that accompanied so much
of his massive singing with the Quinlan
Opera Co., Parker looks quite a youngster.
He is as tall and straight as a gum sapling,
and when he opens his mouth in a crescendo
top-note the welkin trembles. In spite of
a tendency to force his lower notes —a quite
unnecessary effort, for they boom themselves
—the Canadian is a very fine artist. He
sang “The Time is Past,” from “The Flying
Dutchman,” and “Even Bravest Hearts,
from “Faust,” as we’re not likely to hear
them again for a while.
The hidden treasure of the Parker Concert
Co. is the little girl Florence Scapini. She
is 15, conies from Christchurch (MX.), and
was fiddling under di Grassi in Paris when
the war stopped her studies for a while.
This youngster has temperament to add to a
streak of genius, and some day she ought to
make a big flare in the world. Mrs. Carmen-
Harris —formerly Miss Pinscliof, of Mel-
bourne —is highly Commended for resonant
high notes and delightful frocking. Some
of' the frocks, by the way, were in the
southern mail smash, and I don’t know how
they got on. The white and blue creation,
worn on Saturday night, came on with
Mrs. Harris the day before. Mrs. de
Brandt, described as a French pianist, might
oil her finger joints and generally rub up
her technique with advantage.
The Bush Book Club will sort out its
ideas under the sub-regal roof before you
read this. It is the annual counting-up,
with Lady Edeline iu the best chair.
A Burwood lass, Miss Dawborn, landed
the biggest trout at the Kosciusko anglers
carnival. The pond in the Government
hostel grounds covers about six acres. It
has been carefully preserved for about five
years, so bites were numerous. Some or
the competitors were more enthusiastic
than proficient, and a barbed-wire fence m
one corner of the lake was frequently hooked
with great slaughter of adjectives. One
visitor—l fancy Mr. Bob Lee—swished a
salmon rod round the stars, but there weie
no casualties. There was some golf to
round off the Isaak Walton party. Mr. J.
Vicars and the Holts motored up; so did
solicitor Arthur James, of Newcastle, and
his family.
A brilliant young Maorilander, Eric H
Tayler, a son of the Archdale Taylers, of
Auckland, recently died in France, roung
Tayler topped the list of MX. candidates
for a commission in the Imperial army
before the war set Europe in flames. He
joined the Ist Battalion York and Lanca-
shire Reg., which has been pegging away at
the enomv for months. Double pneumonia,
after the long winter in the wet trenches,
was the end.
Superintendent Mitchell, who lately suc-
ceeded the brilliant but short-lived Day as
chief bobby of N. S. Wales, recently
snatched a holiday at Kosciusko, lhe tail
and solid Robert got off the car at Jmda-
byne to have a chat with his local proxy.
Not recognising his chief, the _ proxy was
quite easy and conversational, till a sudden
gleam of remembrance or something struck
him stiff. Then he quick-fired “sir” at the
visitor, and the conversation melted away in
a great official salaam. And yet the chief
constable has the big frame, the geneiail.v
tough and healthy appearance, _ and some-
thing of the manner of the man in blue who
holds up his paw at street corners, so
that even a very young p’liceman ought to
pick him out as something on the beat.
Early this week the subscribers who
parted with five guineas apiece to the
Artists’ War Fund exhibition will know
what they are going to get in return. The
prizes, however, won’t be handed over till
April 28, when the .vanmen will bump the
goods into their chariots outside Vickery s
Chambers.
Gladys Reynell, of Adelaide, lias been
showing her brush work at the Women
Painters’ Exhibition in the Fog. Edith
Hope, a Sydney girl, has also been an ex-
hibitor at ’ various recent overseas’ shows:
the Royal Academy, the old Salon, and other
august bodies have hung her work; and the
National Gallery, Ottawa, bought one of her
pictures. Sister Isabel toils in the handi-
crafts division.
Saturday afternoons are now thickly
studded with money-gathering patriotic
parties. The W. Mellraiths’ effort, m
their capacious garden at Killara, was one
of the solid events of last week. The Bel-
gian larder is likely to be the fatter by
about £3OO.
Kathleen Garvan, a sister of the polo-
playing Garvans, is going to whisper I
will” to an Englishman who signs himsell
Fulke Knatchbull Prideaux-Brune. He be-
longs to a Cornish family.
The annual party at Sailor Cook’s land-
ing place at Botany Bay is to retire behind
the war clouds this year. It is something
of a social tea-fight when it does come oft.
Kurnell, off which the old Endeavor dropped
anchor in the long ago, lends itself to a
picturesque flag-flapping. But the present
moment, when our warships are busy else-
where, is considered by the trustees to de-
mand attention to more serious affairs.
Cook’s ghost won’t mind, though various
correspondents are writing as if the drop-
ping of the picnic will make the manner s
shade turn in its winding sheet.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

For a Soldier the One Camera
is an “ENSIGNETTE”
m
THE “Ensignette” is a tiny, Daylight-loading Camera, made to
take Roll-films. Full-sized postcard pictures can be made
from "Ensignette” negatives by using the special printing
box instead of an ordinary frame. It means that one can produce
full-sized postcard pictures with a camera that slips into the vest
pocket, a camera that you can carry on every occasion, and one that
will never be in the way.
The “Ensignette” is built of metal, and measures, when closed,
”iin. x l|in. x fin. It has a good lens, with adjustable diaphragm
openings F/11, F/36, and F/22. There is a self-contained,
brilliant view-finder and a new Everset Instantaneous and Time
Shutter.
The No. 2 Model is a little bigger, but it will easily fit the
waistcoat pocket.
An “Ensignette,” which can be stowed away in a tunic pocket
or strapped to a belt, is the one and only camera that is really
strong, easy to load, and useful under all circumstances. Every-
thing else is too big or too bothersome. Besides, the “Ensignette”
is British made.

LONG-GUARDEI) FAMILY SECRET
LEARNED THROUGH A PROVIN-
CIAL LADY.
“From mother to daughter, generation
after generation,” writes a lady now <»*
years old, “we have been noted throughout
the little provincial town where we live for
the beauty of our complexions, preserved
even to old age. Of late so many of mu-
friends seem to have been deceived and dis-
appointed by harmful skin remedies that
we have decided it is not right for us to
keep to ourselves any longer the formula
that has always been considered as our fam-
ily secret, and to which we owe our eteinal
youth.’ Therefore we take this opportunity
of communicating it to our sister readeis.
Simply take 2oz. rosewater, 1 dram tincture
of benzoin and 2oz. Flowers of Oxzoin, and
mix them yourself at home. Any chemist
can supply you with what is necessary.
Shake the lotion before using and apply
with a clean piece of cotton wool or a sponge
regularly night and morning. In less than
a week you will surely be asked what has
caused such a wonderful improvement in
your appearance. The freshness of youi
complexion will be dazzling. Me know be-
cause we have often made the very
experiment among our friends, and tins is
the only thing we ourselves have ever used.
It is our family remedy for all complexion
troubles, and has never failed to give the
very highest degree of satisfaction; in tact,
we' consider it an ideal means for pu’serv-
ing the natural health of the skin. 1>
formula is old-fashioned, simple and inex-
pensive, but always efficacious. M e wouk

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, April 10, 1015.
My Dear Yarrie
A medley of sound, composed of the
clashing of cymbals, mashies, putters and
stymies, the sneezing of caddies, and the
rhythmic plashing of falling tea, signified,
last week, that the Berwick Golf Club was
opening for the season. Berwick is in-
habited from time to time by Chirnsides.
Wilsons. Pearsons, Sharps. Knoxes and
a Becketts; also by a few miserable
creatures with less than £5OOO per annum.
Everyone who could afford the price of a
cleek was there, and some extremely heavy
feeding transpired. In the absence of Mrs.
President hßeckett (prostrated by a ner-
vous attack or something similar) the
honors were done by Mrs. Councillor Sharp
and Mrs. Willie Pearson. It was a cheer-
ful, if uneventful, function.
The Tony Horderns are here with a
motor-car that looks as if it had just floated
out of a pantomime, and many other evi-
dences of preposterous wealth. They are
at the Oriental, where I am told they have
a Suite. I am not surprised about the
Suite. I wouldn’t turn so much as a switch
to hear that they had the hotel.
Small dinner-parties have been occurring
at Government House. Melba and Robert
Parker have been singing t> the favored few
in the drawing-room after coffee. Among
recent guests were Lady Ellison-Macartney,
from the Apple l'sland; and Mrs. Scott,
mother of the late Captain Scott, of the
South Pole.
By the way, a hideous story comes to me
of luTw a local hostess sent Melba into din-
ner the other night in front of the Madden
dame. A butler with experience of the
best families immediately swooned,. and of
course the whole party was ruined. This
comes of letting people entertain before they
have passed their exams, in Polite Deport-
ment and Table Etiquette, or even so much
as joined the Dinner-givers’ Union.
A number of kiddies in St. Ivilda and
Middle Park have lately been giving
pennies, threepences and sixpences weekly
to a dear old lady who visited many houses
and pleaded the cause of the Belgians. The
other day it occurred to a St. Kilda woman,
who had been providing her little girl with
sixpence a week for the fund, to ask the
collector what she did with the cash, who
had authorised her to collect it, and a few
other pertinent questions. The venerable
philanthropist faded away like any con-
fidence woman, and has not been heard of
since. It makes one wonder how many of
the 4371 (or thereabout) casual pleaders
who infest the city and suburbs are shak-
ing dishonest coin from the skirts of Bel-
gium’s unhappy mischance.
Young Dr. Jack Gordon, some time of
Melbourne, but more lately of Mena House.
Egypt, has written to friends _ about his
“humpy.” The latter was, in point of fact,
a marble palace. It was originally intended
for a gambling casino—a rival to the famous
one at Monte Carlo. But the scheme fell
through and the vast building merely became
a white elephant, which is not nearly so
lucrative as a gaming hell.
Mrs. G. Macleod Redmond came back from
Sydney and her great misfortune last week.
She is being nursed to health and
happiness by her only sister, Mrs. Joe
Woolf, wife of the man you go to when you
want to be guided through a legal maze.
No man has tried harder to make himself
popular with dogs than headmaster Adam-
son, of Wesley College. He is president of
the Home for Lost Pups, and a big bull
terrier of his own is with him pretty well
everywhere. Yet the other day, when the
poor man chanced to step between a dog
and'some bones, 601 b. of bull terrier (not his
own) hurled itself at his neck and got as
far as his arm. The pedagogue was so
badly mauled and shocked that it was several
days before he could get about. The aris-
tocratic bull terrier’s explanation is that he
regards the president of the Lost Dogs
Home as a dangerous Socialist whose efforts
on behalf of the lower orders are calculated
to destroy those social barriers that are so
necessary in properly constituted society.
It was at a festive bohemian dinner given
by a melodious barrister to a select gather-
ing. Pellican, the celebrated tenor, was
among the number, and somewhere between
soup and nuts he arose suddenly, and called
across the table to his host: “Oh. I say,
you’ll forgive me. won’t you i But 1 forgot to
ring up Lady Blanket. I’m awfully sorry,
but I promised Lady Blanket I would ring
her lip before eight.” He went out, and rang
the telephone bell, and after a brief conversa-
tion returned to his mutton, or whatevei
was going. Later in the evening I ellman
said to his host in a gurgling aside: ‘ lou
know, dear boy, I really hadn t to ring up
Ladv Blanket, but I thought I’d give your
old dinner some tone.” One minute later
the man of law was leading the tenor to, the
front door. "First turning to the left, he
said, “and don’t come hack. ’
From my Adelaide correspondent:
It rained and rained on Saturday, and then it fell
to and really rained, despite which (for we are a
hardy lot) Prince Alfred and St. Peter’s Colleges held
their sports, and, at Morphettville, Tattersall's
Autumn Meeting occurred much as usual except for
the fact that goloshes replaced the footwear of other
days.
Talking of dreadful garments, have “jungle” coats
struck, your city yet ? We have them here in scores.
They are supposed to be made from the hides of
tigers and leopards, but what they look like is the
lining of a waterproof rug.
Partnership’s £59 in the Breeders’ Handicap, and
for second place at that, sent a select few away
happy, but they were very few. lie only attracted
£7 15s.
Our Gladys Revnell has a couple of oils on view at
the Anglo-Belgian Exhibition which is being held at
the Grafton Galleries under the auspices of the
Women's International Art Club. Since 1913 her
canvases have been hung at the Old Salon, the
Walker Gallery, Liverpool, and the Royal Academy.
Vera, second daughter of Mrs. Hall Henderson, of
Tintinara, is engaged to Frank Leslie, the second son
of the Frank Russells, of Salisbury. His good-look-
ing sister was married on the Saturday after Faster
to the youngest son of the late Jenkin Coles.
A Rose Day will occur on April 28, in aid of the
Wattle Day League’s motor-ambulance fund. If that
fails a Cauliflower Day is to be organised to push on
the Wattle-Rose movement. Meanwhile, we are liv-
ing patiently through a Pound Week on behalf of
the Babies’ Hospital. This latter is a more or less
new institution, but Lady Galway approves of it, and
has allowed Government House to be a depot for
“pound” contributions; so its future is glittering
with promise.
Professor Henderson’s first war lecture was given
at the Town Hall on Wednesday night. He has two
more up his sleeve, and there are suspicions abroad
that they will be rushed.
F. S. Holder, eldest son of the late Speaker, came
back from Buenos Aires with his wife and family
aboard the Geelong. He has been doing electrical
engineering work there on the tramways.
Amongst the bequests left by the late .1. 11. Fin-
layson, formerly of the Register, is one of £2OO to
the Adelaide University to form the whole or part
of a fund for the foundation of a scholarship in
political economy; £5O to the Cottage Homes
Society, and £5O to the City Mission.
A St. Ivilda hash-tower is sheltering a
real English soldier who has been invalided
from the war. The surrounding girls are
half mad with excitement and pity and
interest and admiration and a yearning
aspiration to make his stay here enjoyable.
To that end they call persistently on any
old friend or acquaintance who happens to
live in the favored mansion, and, having got
a footing in the establishment, they parade
the terrace and roll languishing eyes at the
Khaki Man who has such a pull over the
boys who are merely going to the war.
However, there is little conversational
change to be got out of the hero. Earnest and
sympathetic cross-examination merely elicits
this sort of thing: “We were in the trenches,
y’know —feahful noise, fiendish din. and I
got hit, y’know.” And then the warrior
relapses into pensive silence. “Goin’ back
in a week or two.” he adds explosively.
After which silence falls again with a thud
between him and the adoring flappers. They
love this pale Othello for the dangers he
has passed, but he. apparently, doesn’t care
a dump that they do pity him.
Rose Day acted as a blight on the Rose
Show —or maybe it was the weather that did
for the blooms. Anyhow the event which
happened last week in the Town Hall was
a disappointment. The Mayor introduced
the suburbanites present to the flowers,
such as they were, band music burbled-
along behind a rose trellis, and some local
talent sang sentimental songs about hearts
and roses. But altogether it was a poor
show.
The Vic. Artists’ Society, which declines
to be downcast by the secession of. the
biggest brushes, opens its annual exhibition
at the Albert-street Galleries on Tuesdav,
the 27th, and will keep it open for nearly
three weeks. If the young, aspiring mem-
bers are well advised, they will offer their
goods at “war prices.” After all. the best
advertisement a painter can get is. from
the sale of a picture. The purchaser invites
friends to come and see the masterpiece and
talks of the day when kindred works will
fetch 50 times what this bargain cost. But
these painter people have no heads for busi-
ness. They’ve only souls for art —some of
them.
Quaite a scene ,at tea time the other day
in a Collins-street cafe. The band played
“God Save the King.” and two ladies present,
who perhaps had no ears for music, omitted
to rise. The rest of the chatterers were
furious. Finally a majestic matron
stalked from her table to their end
of the room and said something. Two
startled and indignant dames turned
and looked her up and down. “I
beg pahdon, what do you mean?” one of
them gasped. After that there ensued what
the daily papers, had they been there, would
have termed a Regrettable Scene. It ended
in the management having to sort out some
of our haughtiest dames and convey them in
hysterics to their cars.
Actress Mary Worth has left for America.
She is returning later to play a steady role
under the management of one Cupid.
One of the saddest men in Melbourne is
William Drummond, whose handsome
nephew Noel died suddenly in Condon last
week. The young man was a sportsman
and very popular hereabouts.
Mrs. Pat Osborne is oyer here enjoying
a pow-wow with her family after so many
months of separation. By the way. I hear
that she is to undergo some sort of nasal
operation. So long as it doesn’t affect the
appearance of her dream of a nose I have
m> objection to lodge.
The newly-returned Madden dame now
wears eyeglasses. Her handsome eyes have
gene so far wrong that she can’t either
read or ply a needle. She is to be operated
on presently, after which the doctors expect
that things will he in all respects as they
were.
From “Rosna,” in London: —
Adelaide artist Margaret 11. Macpherson has two
pictures on the line at the Society of AY omen Artists’
show in Suft'olk-street, and the critics generally shout
for joy when they see them. The Atiien.eum, opening
its ;notice with the Australian’s exhibit, remarked:
“They seem to us the best things on the walls.”
Frank Rutter, in the Sunday Times, pronounced her
“Tulips” one of the best pictures in the exhibition ;
and Sir Claude Phillips, in the Daily Telegraph,
spoke of her “bold yet delicate color harmony.”
The Standard, also giving her exhibits first place,
said “they would lend freshness to any exhibition” ;
and the Morning Post shouted of her “cleverly
arranged and painted subjects.” The Adelaide girl
has made a good record since coming to London IS
months ago, having been accepted for every show,
from the New English Art Club to the Royal Acad-
emy, and she has been on the line every time.
The Athenaeum Club is (and I don’t
wonder) becoming rather fed-up with
Belgian appeals. Some of the older
members snarled fiercely over the two
big Rose and Flag raids made by
indiscriminate Sassiety maidens. It is
believed that after this a decision unfavor-
able to the goddess of charity was arrived
at. Anyhow, it looks like it. The upper
hall of the premises had been promised for a
Repertory Club auction. A charming
woman with an ingratiating manner—a
popular artist’s wife —begged, in addition,
for tea-party concessions in the form of
side rooms and chairs. It was the last
cadge which broke the Club’s temper. The
Powers said they’d be dog-goned (or worse)
if they’d give another inch. “Take the hall
and do with it,” their representa-
tive, and turned disgustedly away. The
women who got up the auction are Availing
about the club’s “want of patriotism.” But
reahly, my dear, don’t you feel in your
secret heart a giggling sympathy with the
badgered men? It is they who have spent
the money at the interminable round of
auctions we have amused ourselves by
organising.
This dependence on Man was proved up
to the hilt at the Rep.’s attempt with the
aid of the plausible Niblo on the block.
There was a shortage of men —the quota
being, in point of fact, about one man to
20 women. And the sales were as dull as a
battered bargain counter. Niblo, with a
wreath of chicory weed on the brown wall
behind his hero-head, coaxed, threatened,
implored-and thundered, but could never get
his “offers” in anything but shillings. Even
a pup which dabbed at Niblo’s cheek
could not tempt pounds. There were some
rare Belgian sabots, and there was a green
heart that had been buried with a Maori-
land chief. There was a live goose fattened
for table (that got some discreet house-
wifely bids) and an Egyptian lamp said to
have belonged to Aladdin’s uncle. But
none of them brought anything to speak of.
Amy Castles sold Belgian flags and made
some pennies. Mrs. Ambrose Patterson’s
three children, dressed as French peasants,
retailed sweets. Also there were strange
garments for sale which gave the wa 11s on
which they were hung a quaintly old cl o'
shop effect. There was one gem of a padded
dressing-gown (dull puce with pink cords)
that stood up by itself and absolutely
prattled to me of embonpoint and felt
slippers, and screw-pins twisted tightly into
middle-aged hair. I don’t fancy it \\ r as sold.
Robert Parker sang on Thursday after-
noon in the Auditorium. The show lasted
but an hour and a half, and it was prac-
tically all Parker, the small violinist only
appearing once or twice during the pro-
ceedings to give him a breathing spell. Lady
Stanley and Melba turned up in an appre-
ciative mood. Melba wore purple plums
stowed away beneath a hard sailor hat
which was tilted at a rakish angle; also
long white suede gloves which she clapped
high in the air at any special prowess on
the part of Parker. Lady Stanley
appeared in a fur hat with a pink rose
aboA r e her high-backed chair and a. pair of
very slim black silk ankles below it. Mrs.
George Armstrong’s cherry-colored military
collar blazed backwards, so to speak, at a
dazzled house. Mrs. Armytage—the dow-
ager of the clan —sported a bonnet of old-
fashioned Tuscan straw, aud there was some
royal purple among her voluminous skirts.
The two star listeners and a chosen few
handed Parker a stirrup cup of tea at the
Quamby Club before he dashed for the
express. Everybody seemed to be taking
nourishment but the poor, worried accom-
panist who, after packing the music, was
seen tearing along Collins-street to the
train in a motor. Mrs. Harris, in the
loveliest navy blue travelling duds, had a
Franeatelli party before she made her dash,
and I also got a fleeting vision of Mamma
Wiedemann Pinschof roaming through the
traffic on the Block with huge posies of
flowers —all by herself and wearing vast
round spectacles. It is a business, getting
these artists moved.
Dr. Springthorpe has been sending home
happy and interesting letters from Egypt—
—not to me, alas! but to his men friends.
“Springy,” as I always call him to myself,
was ever my ideal of what the military
doctor should be. That is as regards appear-
ances. lie would bring a gleam of light to
the saddest of funeral parties. On the
steruer side he makes a specialty of field
ambulance work. lie was president of the
St John Ambulance movement here.
Vanda Clarke, who is now Mrs. Norman
Hodges, wore the sort of bridal gown that is
affected by the Princess in the fairy tale. It
was of fine silver lace mounted on white
tulle. Over this was a Court train of white
silk and silver-thread brocade. It was won-
derfully beautiful; also expensive. Her sis-
ters, who gave her moral support at the
altar, were also distracting visions of silver
lace, variegated by pink and mauve tulle.
Norman could only wear the dull attire of
the male, but he looked beautiful, all the
same, and heightened the effect by sporting
a valuable pale mauve orchid, which is
named Vanda, after his bride.
The wedding was “quiet'’—only one Gover-
nor and nothing at all in the way of brass
bands or megaphones. Lady Stanley wore
rose-color and soft grey furs and a duck ol
a hat. She also wore all her children in a
sort of garden posy round her. Dean Godby
did the knot-tying with the ease of the old
hand. At the subsequent house-party at
Winmarleigh Governor Stanley proposed the
health of the bride, and a very happy little
effort it was. suggesting that he had read her
up as carefully as lie is reputed to do so
many of his other subjects. Dr. Johnson (a
modern young man —not the ghost of the
learned and ancient Samuel) supported Nor-
man as second-best man.
Vanda left for Macedon in a neat travel
ling outfit of dark blue; but when last heard
of she and Norman were tearing across coun-
try in a vast touring car to the Clarke
family’s Mount Seliank station in S.A. Later,
they are leaving for England, whence Nor-
man intends to go to the Front.
Willy Kelly’s clever sister Maisie was mar-
ried last week. The bridegroom is Captain
Joe Kelly, It. N.—not related to the local
Kellys, by the way—-and he has just done
something stupendous in the Dardanelles. I am
not sure that he hasn’t been knighted for it.
an event which, While an everyday occur-
rence in the life of mayors, carries consider-
able significance where sailors are con-
cerned. Maisie Kelly, who has lived
hitherto with her brother F.S., the pianist,
herself plays and sings like a professional.
She first met her husband years ago, when
he was stationed in Australia.
Lady Massereene and Ferrard is the latest
British aristocrat to become a nurse. You
will remember her visit to Federal Govern-
ment House a few years ago. Her tall and
alluring figure and pretty Irish face caused
a distinct stir among the baldheads at
theatres and restaurants. Her somewhat
depressed-looking husband has been at the
Front for some months with the 1< th
Lancers.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

Nothing equals “California Syrup of Figs”
for children’s ills; give a teaspoonful, and
in a few hours all the waste matter, sour bile
and fermenting food clogged in the bowels
pass out of the system, anl you have a
healthy and playful child again. All chil-
dren love this harmless, delicious “fruit laxa-
tive,” and it never fails to effect a good
“inside cleansing.” Directions for babies,
children of all ages and grown-ups are plainly
on the bottle.
Keep it handy in your home. A little
given to-day saves a sick child to-morrow,
but get the genuine. Ask your chemist for
a bottle of “California Syrup of Figs,” then
look and see that it is made by the “Cali-
fornia Fig Syrup Company.” Counterfeits
are being sold here. Refuse substitutes.

THE "TOP NOTCH” SCOTCH.

WHISKY.
A UNIFORM STANDARD of QUALITY.
ABORIGIN-
ALITIES
“H.G.” : Allow me to butt in to this coach-
driving argument and nominate “Tommy” Cawker,
of Casterton, tor the prize. Sixty-two years ago,
when he was a youngster of 10, he made his debut,
and took mails along the line from Geelong to Ham-
ilton in a spring-cart. There were no bridges then,
but there was plenty of excitement. In the ’so’s he
made a change to the Geelong-Ballarat trip, and
later ran the coach from Ararat to Port Fairy. In
1861 he bought the line from Penola to Hamilton,
and later from Narracoorte. Soon afterwards he
ran another line from Port Mac Donnell to Lacepede
Bay, and in that year (1862) ran the first coach
through from Mount Gambier to Victoria. This
line was established to join the Adelaide to Mel-
bourne coaches at Tullock, in Vic. Later the Mount
Gambier to Casterton run superseded it, and is still
going strong. The building of the Adelaide to Mount
Gambier line, and later the Beachport to Mount
Gambier line, stopped the coaches along those
routes. Late last month “Tommy” drove the last
regular horse-coach from Mount Gambier to Caster-
ton. He had driven the first, and was determined to
be in at the death. The price of fodder has made
horse flesh too expensive, and the neddies have had
to give way to a motor. “Tommy” did not like
making the change, but it had to come. There isn’t
enough paper in stock to calculate how many miles
he has held the ribbons. Anyway, it’s about 7000
more than it is to Tipperary, and then possibly
a mile or two has been missed. When he drove
George, now King, then Princeling, from Narra-
coorte to Hamilton, “Tommy” was invited to drop
in if ever he visited England, and have a spin
behind one of the regal teams. “Tommy” said quite
frankly that he wouldn’t think of going to England
to see the Prince, but intended to go home some
day and see his sister, and if he had time he would
call on his Highness. He is 78 now, straight as a
rush with his 6ft. odd, his hand as steady as any
young man’s, and he thinks that in a few years’
time, after he has done a lot more work, he may go
to England. But, on second thoughts, he always
reckons there is plenty of time yet.

“Reefer”: For the Wetness Handicap
please put Papua on scratch. I haven’t the per-
formances of the really damp places, and last year
was the droughtiest on record, but at Lakekamu the
trickle was 179 in. for 224 days; at loma 181 in. for
201 days, and liikori was sprinkled with 155 in. in
203 days. There are no gauges away in the moun-
tains, where it rains by the foot almost every after-
noon. A thousand-gallon tank might do, provided
the measurement was taken and the gauge emptied
daily.
* * # *
“Outcast” : The most curious Papuan cus-
tom connected with betel-chewing is that found in
Rossel Island, where some 600 Chows were once
eaten. The betel quid is allowed to accumulate along
the eight upper teeth until it becomes level with
the upper lip, the material, of course, becoming hard
and fixed in course of time. The mass presses the
lip outwards, and when the wearer smiles the lip is
necessarily drawn inwards and upwards, giving the
sroiler something of the appearance of a snarling
dog. The right to use this beautifier is strictly con-
fined to the chiefs, so that when you see an extra-
ordinarily horrible-looking person on Rossel you will
at once know he is a State Governor, or ex-Minister
at £4 a day and expenses, or something like that.
PASSED THE LIMIT.
MRS. McG LUE: “I wouldn't ha' minded 'er
callin' me a liar an sayin' I was half me
time shickered, Mrs. Meggs; but after that
she started ter get personal.”
“Copabella”: There’s a gate notice near
Lankey’s Creek (N.S.W.) which beats all others. It
is in white letters along the top rail, and reads:
“Can’t you shut the damned gate?” Appealed to in
that way, they mostly can.
’ ENERY’S VOCATION.
THE BOSS: “ Well, what sort of work can you do?”
MYSTERIOUS ’E BERY: “sh! Between you and me, Boss, I'm an ex-spy, and I thought
as ’ow yer might engage me to keep an eye on the other blokes ter see they didtn't
shirk their jobs."
“Bad Australian”: Camped on the Cen-
tral Andes (S. America), I was out with a 12-bore
shotgun trying to collect one of the semi-occasional
ducks which drop in on their way to Brazil or Pekin,
or somewhere, and made for a small arroyo, which
soaked out of the lower end of a salar. When I
struck the bank of the arroyo I looked cautiously
over, and was suddenly up against the limit. An
old-man puma about the size of a full-grown mastiff,
but set on much shorter legs, was standing at the
foot of the bank, at a distance of about 30ft., look-
ing into my eyes. 1 am free to confess that at that
moment 1 was about the worst-scared individual in
S. America ; but on the principle of “one hit before
I go” 1 loosed off both barrels of No. 2 into the
front elevation of that cat. And, 10, he crumpled
up like a wowser in a brewery, and the tale of his
days was told. When I planked the pelt down in
camp my little following of Indians were the most
astonished crowd since Manco Capac; they couldn’t
figure out how any human being should be so
adaptable as to go out after a duck and bring
home a “leon.” I have seen the “leon” in all his
pristine ferocity run down by a pair of half-naked
Indian boys, mounted on mules, lassoed fore and
aft to a sapling, like a poddy calf, and outed by a
bash on the head with any old missile that happened
to be hand} 7 . I have seen the jaguar in his native
wilds, and I have never known him to jag amongst
humans to the extent of one square foot of sticking-
plaster ; and tht rest of the “ravening scourges of
the wild” are, in my opinion, exactly the same kind
of fraud. The only genuinely dangerous and abso-
lutely ferocious “scourge” I have bumped against on
this continent is the half-breed when he has taken
on his load of pisco or a ana, and feels that he really
must tear the universe inside out. When I see that
scourge raging I always reach for my siege gun so
as to get in early and with sufficient punch to even-
up the discussion.
* * * #
“Pipitea”: About 40 years ago a bishop
and his retinue made a trek through that part of
the main country where natives were still healthy and
of a most obliging nature. He was given a hurray
reception, and when the shades of night had fallen
fast the ganger of the chief’s harem arrived, pur-
porting to top off the menu according to custom by
advancing his Gaiters a wife. The parson who was
in front of the house for the bishop was horrified at
the thought. The Bishop, he said, would be shocked
beyond expression about it. “Don’t you understand,”
he asked the Henare:“his Lordship’s a bishop?” The
delegate scratched the right half-section of his upper
deck thoughtfullly, and got a notion. “Oh yeh,”
said the inspired editor of the harem. “A bih-iiyop,
hey? Bee-ee-g ferrer! By crite, me give him two.”
“Pick”: If any stockman knows how to
head off or wheel a desert, Jet him issue a com-
munique to the fettlers at Billilingra, on the Cooma
(N.S.W.) line. Billilingra, once a splendidly-grassed
sheep-run, has now been reduced by rabbits to a
sandy waste, whose surface races eastward with every
westerly blow. Fences and trees are buried, gullies
levelled, and on extra-windy days the Eumeralla and
’Bidgee . rivers, which sough along that desolate
way, are temporarily dammed. When the advanced
tongue of the moving country reached the railway,
the fettlers walled it back with discarded sleepers
and brush, but the sand soon tumbled over the
barricades. Now the whole desert is gradually en-
croaching upon the line, while the weary fettlers,
madly whirling their shovels, inquire what they are
to do next. Sure enough there is trouble ahead.
Where there is nothing to eat and millions of rab-
bits. to eat it, Port Pirie and marram grasses, which
have been successfully employed to pull up travelling
sand elsewhere, would have no show. Whatever the
solution, the fettlers take their frenzied oath that
there is a limit to holding back a ten-mile desert
with old railway sleepers.

A SONG OF RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Because a little vagrant wind veered south from
China Sea ;
Or else' because a sun-spot stirred; and, yet, again,
mil}' lie
Because some idle god in play breathed on an
errant cloud,
The heads of twice two million folk in gratitude are
bowed.
Patter, patter... .Boolcoomatta,
Adelaide and Oodnadatta,
Pepeyoona, parched and dry,
Laugh beneath a dripping sky.
Riverina’s thirsting plain
Knows the benison of rain.
Ararat and Arkaroola
Render thanks with Tantanoola
For the blessings they are gaining,
And it’s raining- — raining—raining !
Because a Heaven-sent monsoon the mists before it
drove;
Because things happened in the moon; or else
because high Jove,
Unbending, played at waterman to please a laugh-
ing boy,
The hearts through half the continent are raised in
grateful joy.
Weeps the sky at Wipipipee,
Far Farina’s folk are dippy
With sheer joy, while Ballarat
Shouts and flings aloft its hat.
Thirsty Thackaringa yells;
Taltabooka gladly tells
Of a season wet and windy;
Men rejoice on Murrindindie;
Kalioota’s ceased complaining ;
For it’s raining—raining — raining!
Because a poor bush parson prayed an altruistic
pray’r,
Rich with unselfish fellow-love that Heaven counted
rare;
And yet, mayhap, because one night a meteor was
hurled
Across the everlasting blue, the luck was with our
world.
On the plains of Winininnie
Wattle low and horses whinny,
Frolicking with sheer delight.
From Beltana to The Bight,
In the Mallee’s sun-scorched towns,
In the sheds on Darling Downs,
In the huts at Yudnapinna,
Tents on Tidnacoordininna
To the sky all heads are craning,
For it’s raining — raining—raining !
Because some strange, cyclonic thing has happened—-
God knows where —
Men dream again of easy days, of cash to spend and
spare.
The ring fair Clara coveted, Belinda’s furs are nigh,
As clerklings watch their increments fall shining from
the sky.
Rolls the thunder at Eudunda;
Leongatha, Boort, Kapunda
Send a joyous message down;
Sorrows, flooded, sink and drown.
Ninkerloo and Neerim South
Ilail the breaking of the drouth;
From Toolangi’s wooded mountains
Sounds the song of plashing fountains;
Sovereign Summer’s night is waning;
It is raining — raining—raining !
Because the breeze blew sou’-by-east across the China
Sea;
Or else because the thing was willed through all
eternity
By gods that rule the rushing stars, or gods long
seons dead,
The earth is made to smile again, and living things
are fed.
Mile on mile, from Malacoota
. Runs the news, and far Baroota
Speeds it over hill and plain,
Till the slogan of the rain
Rolls afar to Yankalilla;
Wallaroo and Wirrawilla
Shout it o’er the leagues between,
Telling of the dawning green.
Frogs at Cocoroc are croaking,
Booboorouie soil is soaking;
Oodla Wirra, Orroroo
Breathe relief and hope anew.
Wycheproof and Wollongong
Catch the burden of the song
That is rolling, rolling ever
O’er the plains of Never Never,
Sounding in each mountain rill,
Echoing from hill to hill. . . .
In the lonely, silent places
Men lift up their glad, wet faces,
And their thanks ask no explaining,
It is raining — raining—raining I

“Wandi”: Recently a couple of immi-
grants arrived in Sydney whose luggage included a
supply of sickles and reaping-hooks. They were
evidently < reapers, who expected lucrative employ-
ment heri in that line. It is a big leap from the
reaping-hpok to the reaper and binder, not to men-
tion other efficient harvesting machinery in use in
Australia to-day; but there was plenty of use for the
old hook at one time, and a field that can now be
quickly harvested by half a dozen men provided
a lengthy picnic for a little regiment. The
expert reaper was proud of the skill with which he
used the curved blade, and of the number of sheaves
he could cut in a day. So was the veteran who
wielded the scythe—which was an improvement on
the reaping-hook. Mowing was a good occupation,
for there was plenty of it. Thousands of acres
every year awaited the scythe; and the men who
could mow an acre a day were the people who mono-
polised the conversation. Now they merely share
the boneyard.
“G&S” : I concur, as Justice Barton would
say, in “Pick’s” statement (B. 25/.2/’l5) that Gov-
ernment officials are frequently responsible for the
misspelling of Australian place names. Bowenfells,
on the N.S.AY. Western line, was always correctly
spelled like that on the name-board of the railway
station until some departmental satrap got to work
and substituted “Bowenfels.” “Fels” is German for
a rock; “fells” is Scotch for a chain of steep hills.
Andrew Brown, who came from Perthshire, named it
the latter appropriate way. Bowen was a surveyor,
it’s said.
“Snell”: Burne discovered the fire in
Lloyd’s two-roomed skillion at Possum Flat, and
roused Sheldon and Eddie as he ran. A couple of
diggers came from their tents by the creek, and the
contents of Lloyd’s water-butt were spilled on the
burning ediftce withou t doing much mischief. Then
it OCOUITe d to Sheldon that it would perhaps' be as
well to see about getting Lloyd out before going
further. Lloyd was found in a bunk in the living-
room, and was dragged forth. He recovered in the
open ai-r, and then started to run back. Burne tried
to stop him? and he oute d the poor fellow with a
n , ungrateful swipe on the chin, and plunged into
the smoke and flames. There was a grim, watchful
interval of perhaps a minute; then Lloyd reappeared,
carrying in his arms half of an ordinary dress basket.
The men pressed forward eagerly. The basket con-
tained a litter of pups. Lloyd was halt a minute
recovering breath and eyesight. iThen he counted the
pups , “Helen tommy!” hessaid, “I’ve dropped one!
You might go in fer it, Eddie,” he said. “It’ll be
on the floor near my bunk.” Eddie turned away in
disgust, an’ Llovd called after him. “While yer in
migh t bring the missus,” he said.

“Hamer” : The law provides that the man

“McNortli”: In the matter of defence
many of the far-inland mountain tribes of Papua
are no slouches. Wherever possible they perch their
villages on high razor-backed spurs or peaks—and in
that topsy-turvy country such formations are fre-
quent. A high palisading of split slabs is built
around the village and watch towers erected. From
these latter, which often consist of a house built in
a tree, a constant lookout is kept, and because of
their elevated position and the fact that the ground
slopes away- abruptly, on both sides they are very
effective. Entrance is obtained to the compound by
means of a small hole in the stockade through which
only one person at a time may crawl. Sometimes
a cheerful savage with a club is posted just inside
the door, so it’s as well to send some of the carriers
through first. The gardens are usually low down the
spur on both sides, and in such positions that they
are in full view’ from the village. Therefore the
women, who do all the agricultural work, can’t come
home early with the excuse that they were disturbed
and pursued by strange men. When there is trouble
with other tribes, arrow-heads are buried in the
ground, with the points sticking up an inch or so
and slanting slightly in the direction from which
the enemy is expected to come. Many a night raid
has been spoilt by the yell of one of the would-be
attackers as he put his bare foot on a hidden arrow
point. Years ago I was chasing the nimble penny-
weight in a region 18 days’ walk from the coast. The
niggers were distinctly hostile, but the fact that I
could walk without harm over arrow-heads, which, of
course, couldn’t penetrate my thick mountaineering-
boots, was the cause of considerable astonishment,
and made those wondering niggers have a great re-
spect for the strange white man. The use of a
little discretion and kindness will often turn them
from enemies to friends. At one place, 6000 ft. above
the sea, there were five stockaded villages strung
along a narrow, sloping spur. I was in a narrow
.ravine 1000 ft. below, with half a mile of carriers
and camp followers. All day long the niggers above
had been yelling and firing arrows and rolling stones
down on us. Under the circumstances that ravine
didn’t seem a very healthy place to camp. So I
decided to climb to the top of the ridge, and have
the unfriendly nigs.- below me. To do so it was
necessary to pass through the whole five villages.
Half-way up the yelling was terrible, and 1 shall
never forget the sight of those scores of naked
savages, their forms silhouetted against the sky,
frenziedly dancing and slapping their thighs and
shaking their spears in anger at us. Flocks of
arrows and stones fell around us, and although no
one was hurt, there were some narrow squeaks. Before
I got to the first village the noise had stopped, and
on breaking an entrance through the stockade I
found the village deserted. But here and there,
in the long la-lang grass which flanked the spur,
could be seen the heads of the hiding warriors.
Each village was deserted in turn as I approached
it, but the inhabitants returned as soon as my
party had passed through. At the last village I
decided to camp, and an hour or so later two old
men cautiously approached. I made signs to them that
it was all right, and placed some salt and a looking-
glass on the ground near them, at the same time
exposing a box of trade goods. The old nigs, gin-
gerly picked the salt up and tasted it. r I lien they
shouted to their friends, and in a little while the
compound was crowded with the villagers bringing
presents of sweet potatoes, yams, etc., and the chief
was telling me what a good fellow I was, anil
remarking that for another fistful of salt he would
make a blood-brother of me. - Half a dozen pigs
were killed in my honor, and everyone had a great
blowout. I left that' spur with regret. In fact,
if the Germans beat the Allies and take Australia,
I’m going back there. Life would be much pleas-
anter with those primeval savages than under the
civilised fiends of Bill the Brute.
“Pick”: Louis JGsson’s poem., “The Mo-
poke” (B. 25/3/’lo), once again calls up for someone
to correctly report the language of the boboolc owl,
whose night cry has been variously translated by
natural-history poets and writers as “mopoke, ’
“mokepoke” and “morepork.” Every bushman with
a correct ear knows that the bird’s call is a reiter-
'ated plea for “work, work.” The bobook is, in fact,
the feathered sundowner. He begs for work every
evening, and hides from it every day. His dour
aspect and embittered profile are the outcome of
long brooding over the libels that have been written
about him ever since King Binghi abdicated the
throne.
“C.H.N.”: “Pick’s” remarks re leeches
(B. 10/12/’l4) remind me of a worse experi-
ence here in Papua. After capturing all the Shar-
mans, and having nothing better to do except fight
Waria cannibals, I strolled along the so-called beach,
mostly consisting of mangrove, crossed the Waria,
Wu Wu and Eia rivers, and came to what is called
in this ungodly end of the earth a sago swamp, but
in reality is square miles of soft mud and river
scum up to your middle. I made for a point which
looked like civilised beach. But it was only more
scum and more sour mud. I picked off all the insects
I'd accumulated —when you talk of insects in this
blighted hole you do the vermin a compliment—and
sat down to grub. Then out they came. The
niggers said they were sand flies. Skeeter, scorpion,
Tas. devil, leeches and the million other works of
Satan are nothing compared with these detestable
little yellow-bellied, blue-winged works of hateful-
ncss itself. They start by enveloping you in count-
less numbers, get in your ears and eyes, make a
break through every exposed inch of you, and then
calmly burrow through your skin and settle inside.
The burrowing process itself isn’t painful, but after-
wards words fail. Yet some of these Papuan canni-
bals live on the beaches, and I’ve seen them camped
between the so-called beach and a malarial swamp
barely 20 yards inland. Why, an old Presbyterian’s
description of Hell is not within leagues of it.
IF COWS WORE CORSETS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If cows wore corsets I would go
To see the Sydney Easter Show.
But at nude cows I cannot gape
When they are always the same shape.
A variation of the line
Is vital to each feminine.
I can’t see why the law allows
Exceptions in the case of cows.
And, while I wonder thus, I. stay
From every Easter Show away.
For when each 3'ear square cows I see,
Square cows no longer int’rest me.
But I would hurry to the grounds
If hour-glass cows walked on their rounds.
To ev’ry show I would
If Ayrshires used the JKifting waist,
And Jerseys, fawn and.mild of eye,
In whalebone-moulds' wept pacing by.
With cash no Show will I endow
For this monotony of cow.
But give them corsets and I’ll go
With keen delight to every Show !

THE CURE FOR SORE THROAT.
Everyone who suffers from sore throat should
send at once the coupon printed here, which will
bring a free supply of Wulfing’s Formamint.
This pleasant-tasting, harmless tablet gives
immediate relief from the pain of sore throat;
cures it rapidly ; prevents further attacks ; and
safeguards the user against catching other in-
fectious diseases like diphtheria, consumption of
the lungs, scarlet fever, measles, etc.
Wulfing’s Formamint is endorsed by over
10,000 doctors, as well as by thousands of other
people like those whose letters are printed opposite.
All Chemists sell it, price 2/6d. per bo tie, but
insist on Wulfing's, the only genuine Formamint,
as its great success has produced many worthless
imitations.

FORMAMINT IS BRITISH MADE.
Lord Glantawe writes: “I have been using
Wulfing’s Formamint for Sore Throat with most
satisfactory results.”
General Tillard, C. 8., writes : “ Formamint
has afforded me ready relief when, as is frequently
the case, I have been suffering from Sore Throat.’
Lord Kingsale writes: “I and my family
use quite a number of Wulfing’s Formamint
Tablets and find them all you say they are.
I always carry a goodly number in my pocket,
and have recommended them to many friends.
Wulfing’s Formamint is also used by the
Rt. Hon. Arthur J. Balfour, M.P., Sir Gilbert
Parker, M.P., the Hon. Mrs. Alfred Lyttelton,
etc., etc.

A wise old beak sits on the bench at
Oamaru (M.L.) —a dry district where the
wowser rages in his bleakness. The other
day an old party charged with making and
selling good wine was fined £25 and costs ;
but when the police applied for permission
to confiscate the liquor and destroy it they
were met by a firm “No!” Solomon pointed
out that tiie police and everyone else had
sworn that the wine was excellent stuff, and
as he considered waste a sin the grog would
be handed over to the local hospital. The
Me Wowsers have been shaking their heads
ever since about such a verra ter-r-rible
outrage.
* * * *
“N. or M.” : “Iv” wrote some ’ weeks ago
on the alarming increase in the rabbit popu-
lation of Western Victoria. It is the same
here in Tassy. With the outbreak of war
the price of skins of all kinds dropped
pretty well to zero, and the net result was
a close season for bunny. The drought,
which might have been expected to keep
down the birth-rate, did nothing of the sort,
and harassed farmers are making anxious
inquiries about wire-netting and wondering
why Moses didn’t afflict Pharaoh with rab-
bits instead of playing round with locusts
and frogs. Minister of Lands Belton sug-
gests trapping, and at the same time doing
a good turn to Belgium by sending ship-
ments of frozen rabbits to that Hun-ridden
country, and it is to be hoped something
will come of the scheme. But at present the
freezing accommodation is very limited.
Space is required for sending meat to the
Front, cold storage is chock-a-block, and
Tasmanian orchardists are on tenter hooks.
These orchardists have suffered from many
and divers slings and arrows of late. The
weather, after doing nothing for long, rain-
less months, fell upon the ripening fruit
in chunks, with storms of hail and howling
winds. Now the orchardist doesn’t know
whether his space in the apple boats may
not be commandeered, in which case the
remainder of his year’s crop will be thrown
on a glutted Australian market.
“W.D.Y.” : For some years past the Gulf
Steamship Co. has had a monopoly of the
trade of St. Vincent Gulf ports and the
Adelaide Steamship Co. has had the same in
Spencer Gulf, on the other side of Yorke
Peninsula, the most prolific wheat-growing
part of S. Aus. There seemed to be an
understanding between the two companies
not to do any poaching. However, some-
thing went wrong, and a few months ago
the Gulf Co. (much the smaller concern)
started running in Spencer’s Gulf. The
Adelaide Co. retaliated by trading in St.
Vincent's, and fun began. Freights dropped
75 per cent, in a day ; fares ditto. St. Vin-
cent’s Gulf ports had a boat practically
every day—two a week sufficed before. Any-
one sending over half a ton or so of goods
rarely had to purchase a ticket, an invita-
tion to travel being almost invariably
offered. Each co. circularised the Peninsula,
showing the exorbitant fares and freights
charged before. The public of course wel-
comed the new co. in each place, and the
companies responded by banqueting the lead-
ing citizens. But the fun didn’t last long.
The smaller co. put up a good fight, but was
soon swallowed. Freights and fares jumped
to the old scale the day after the swallow.
Then services were cut down to half, and
complimentary tickets were no longer on
tap. Season tickets were at one time issued,
but these are new out of favor, and a long-
suffering public is daily expecting a further
increase in fares to make up for the reduc-
tions during the wild time of competition.
“Full-weight” : It is about time some other
robbers besides the baker and milk-and-
water man were touched up for short
weight. I’ve been handling soap for some
time, and of bars that are sold as 40 to the
cwt. one lot recently weighed 851 b., another
1001 b., another 951 b., and still another 861 b.
Some are wrapped in paper and some are
nude. The heaviest is unwrapped, and pro-
bably weighed a little over 1001 b. when it
left the factory. Jams are sold in tins as
one and two lb. The 11b. case contained
to 140 z., and the 21b. 270 z. to 28oz.
Currant cases supposed to contain 561 b.
weighed gross 601 b. to 621 b., and the case
panned out about 81b. One-pound tins of
baking powder contained 13oz. to 140 z., re-
puted quart bottles were l-6th of a gallon.
Kapok dealers allow 41b. for the bale, which
often weighs 101 b. to 111 b. This means with
an 801 b. bale at Bd. lb. (about the average
price), 4s. 6d. for an old jute bale of no
value afterwards. As kapok posts less than
fourpence in Java this is a bit stiff. About
the only honest weight we get is from the
so-called monopolists. A 701 b. bag of sugar
or a 501 b. bag of flour contains those weights ;
and treacle and sugar are the weight
marked on packages. Nearly all imported
goods, especially English, contain the full
number of ounces they are sold as. Salmon
and herrings contain Boz. or 160 z.. as the case
may be. So does cornflour and arrowroot.
Tea lends itself to swindles and big profits,
but it is honest weight, while coffee is some-
times 14oz. to the lb. If the law compelled
manufacturers to put net weight in all
packages the public would know what _ it
was buying. It is done in other countries
and should be made compulsory in Australia.
“Clinker” : My final consignment of super-
phosphate for the season has arrived, just
seven days after it started on its 300-mile
journey from Sydney. It recalls the time
the Western line was completed as far as
Wallerawang.. As usual, the day the first
train arrived was made a gala day. Amongst
the crowd of sightseers was an old chap
named Gleeson. He had walked in, and
when he arrived at the platform the engine
was just shunting away. Gleeson ran after
it as fast as his 70 years would permit,
shouting to it to stop till he had a look. Of
course no notice was taken of him. and he
was speedily-distanced. “Be the t’underin’
hell, now,” said he, “whin ye’re as ould as
me ye won’t be so fast.” I’m beginning to
think he was right.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” on ancient signs:
In the first ’so’s William Howitt wrote of a pub
he saw at Flemington, three miles from Melbourne.
It was the Bull and Mouth—the sign a formidable
bull standing upon a huge month, which looked like
a great oyster, and over its head an eye enclosed
in a “glory,” meant to represent the Deity! Around
it were the words, “Fear God and Honor the Queen.’
“What a sign,” says Howitt, “for a pot-house!”
In 1841 a pub on the Melbourne-road, seven miles
from Dandenong, was named “The No Good Damper
Inn.” It kept a gentleman named De Villiers. In
1852 The Pick and Shovel was at Tourbournie, Gee-
long district, a station formed by .1. H. Patterson.
The Old Lamb Inn, a wattle-and-dab hut in Market
Square, Melbourne, was the start of “Scott’s.” The
Menzies’ of to : day had its birth in an obscure
house in La Trobe-street, on the south side, between
Elizabeth and Swanston streets. It had been built
as a private house, and stood back from the street.
Archibald Menzies added a bar on the corner of the
right-of-way, and there opened in 1854 or ’55 -not
’52, as stated frequently. One Archibald Menzies-
the same, no doubt —had kept The Hope Tavern, on
the corner of York and King streets, Sydney, not
far from the southern gate of the old Barrack
Square. Later, when the soldiers were shifted to
Paddington, he kept The Star, in George-strcet;
David Jones’s premises now cover the site. That
was in 1850. In 1867 Archibald Menzies purchased
the corner of William and Bourke streets, Melbourne.
On it stood a fine villa, which had been occupied
one time by Dr. Campbell and the elder Justice
Williams. It was said when Menzies was building
the new house that he was “going out into the bush” ;
but the Spencer-street Railway Station was develop-
ing, and Menzies’ keen Scotch intellect told him
that the city would move his way.
* * * *
“The Pariah” : Mention in the cables that
a section of the Chinese are clamoring for
a boycott of Japanese goods calls to mind
that the weapon has been used twice by
China in the past nine years. The U.S.A.
were the first object, and while no definite
estimate of the damage to American trade
can be made, Australia’s export of flour to
China jumped from 600 to 10,000 tons in a
year, and several mills on the China coast,
which had been struggling for an existence,
suddenly became affluent and declared divi-
dends. ' Incidentally the secretary of one of
them managed to vamoose with £15,000.
In 1907-8 the big boycott of Japan started.
In May of the latter year I saw in Canton
hundreds of tons of Jap. goods hustled into
suitable places and burned with Chinese
pomp and extravagant transports rage
and contempt. According to Japan’s “Year
Book” the whole show lost Nippon £6,500,000
that year.
THE SONG OF THE “PATRIOTIC” SHOPKEEPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
With posters done in blue and red
My shop is plastered o’er ;
Cute schemes for gain are in my head
As here, beside my door,
I talk with likely customers about “this awful war.”
“Our Patriotic Sale’s Begun,”
“Amazing Sacrifice” —
So do my flaunting posters run—
“ Goods at Three-quarter Price.”
“Buy One of Our ‘King Albert’ Hats, New Style
and Very Nice.”
“This awful war”- —I roll my eyes—
“lt ruins honest trade !
All German goods, sir, I despise!
Now these smart coats were made
In England; warranted to wear, and will not shrink
or fade.
“Down with the Kaiser! Sir, it wrings
My upright, British soul
To think of all the fearful things
He’s done to win his goal. ...
Wool ’comforters for soldiers, ma’am ? Yes. For-
ward, Mister Mole!”
y
“Indeed, indeed it’s very hard ;
But we must not repine....
That flannel? Two-and-three a yard.
Yes, ma’am, a special line ;
Cut for our Patriotic Sale”....and dear at onc-and-
nine!
“Ah, these poor Belgians! Sir, it shocks
All human decency !. .. ■
(I sold five gross of ‘Belgian’ socks
Last week at one-and-three !)....
Poor, starving folk! It hurts me, sir, such misery
to see!”
“Come to our Patriotic Sale!”
“Great War Reductions Made!”
Such cunning phrases never fail
To capture goodly trade.
“Inspect our dress-goods! Like our troops they will
not run nor fade.”
“Yes, ma’am, that little ornament
Was made in Germany.
The price is up fifteen per cent.,
Because, of course, you see,
’Twas bought before the war, and now that line
we can’t' indent.”
“Ahem !... .Yes, as you say, sir, true—
A race of thieves and spies.
And, let me say, between us two,
All Germans I despise !. . . .
Ah, that reminds me, have 3 T ou seen this line of
‘Joffre’ ties?”
“Enlist, Young Man, if You are Fit!”
So reads my window sign.
(And, while you’re thinking over it,
Come and inspect our line
Of special scarves for brave recruits. Dirt-cheap at
three-and-nine.)
With posters done in red and blue
Mr shop-front flames and flares;
While busily 1 plan anew
My patriotic snares
For trusting customers who come to buy my shoddy
wares.
’Tis an ill wind. .. .Between ourselves,
These Germans do some good.
They’ve helped to clear from off my shelves
Old stock I never should
Have sold unless.... Ah, well, a man must earn his.
livelihood.
“Come to Our Patriotic Sale!”
“Cheap Goods While Times are Slack.”
With secret joy my ad. I nail
Beside the Union Jack,
And blithely make a hoarding of a stricken People’s
back.
VICTORIA,
TOOLANGI.

Dr. Falliere’s Flesh-Food
to all Thin or Undeveloped Women.
OMAN without full bust development lacks the one essential that creates a perfect
appearance. Lack of proper bust development, hollow cheeks and “salt-cellars” quickly take
Irom a woman the bloom and freshness of healthy womanhood. Misfortune may have been
your lot in so far as natural development is concerned, but science has found a way to correct
your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-bosomed, and have been attenuated all
jom life, it you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be fully developed and vour
v\eigit increased to normal There are, to-day, hundreds of women who were once thin,
fiat-bosomed, liollow-cheeked and generally scraggy in appearance, and suffering the effects of
anaemia and defective digestion, who are now. for the first time in their lives, healthy, full-
bosomed and pink-cheeked and enjoying the full vigor of robust womanhood, as the result of a
tew weeks under our wonderful treatment.
Let us Send You Scores of Letters like this one!
Manager, — Gympie, Queensland.
Dear Sir, As a nurse I was very interested in your Flesh-Food treatment, and was greatly sur-
prised at the wonderful results in my ease. When I first wrote you I was only skin and bone, and
I have good cause to be thankful that I wrote you for a free sample, for I feel certain now that
I am one of the very best advertisements you could possibly have, as I am developed in every
way satisfactory to myself, and I have waited a good while to prove if it was lasting in its effect,
and I am now glad to say that your splendid treatment has done absolutely all you claimed it
would, my weight and measurements being ample. — I am, yours gratefully,
MRS. E. WINGROVE.
In many cases bust measurements have been increased by over 10in.. and the gain in actual
weight —equally distributed over the body in generally deficient cases —has been over five
pounds weekly. Home other cases have sxiown an increase in weight of even a pound a day
lhe average bust increase desired is about Gin., and is readily accomplished Guarantee given
in every case accepted.

Finest Electrical Equipment
The o verland is supplied with the
most advanced and efficient two
unit electrical system.
An electric motor starts the car.
An electric generator furnishes current
for the motor and the lights.
Motor and generator are separate
machines. Each does its work more
efficiently than a machine which serves
both purposes.
A high tension magneto furnishes
ignition. No uncertain and troublesome
dry batteries are required.
There is a full-toned electric horn.
The entire electrical equipment is
controlled by buttons on the steering post.
The buttons, placed in the most con-
venient position, are reached without even
leaning forward.
The O verland is as completely satis-
factory in point ot electrical equipment as
it is in point of beauty, comfort, economy,
safety and durability. These qualities are
guaranteed by the fact that the Overland
is made entirely by the tremendous Willys-
Overland organisation. It is not an
“assembled” car. Every part is made by
our own workmen under our own direction.
Inspection may be made at the local
show rooms.

BILIOUSNESS OVERCOME,
AND GOOD HEALTH ENJOYED SINCE
USING DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOI
PILLS.
A typical illustration of tire corrective
properties of Dr. Morse’s Indian Root I ills
is the experience of Mrs. Marie I orrester,
which is described in the following letter.
“I am pleased to state that Dr. Morses
Indian Root Pills are an excellent remedy
for biliousness,” writes Mrs. Marie I orrester.
of 126 Constitution-road, Dulwich Hill.
N.S.W. “Some years ago I suffered much
from this disorder, but latterly, since using
your remedy, I have experienced good
health. I also know them as a useful medi-
cine for constipation. You have my full
consent to use this testimonv foi publica-
tion.”*
POLITICAL
POINTS
Till the other day practically all the gas
globes and lamp glasses that Australia used
came from Austria and Germany; now
some of them begin to come from Leich-
hardt, just outside Sydney. A few years
ago four or five co-operators set up the
little Federal works, and have pushed ahead
in a modest way. Now, with the lift the
war has given the industry and the promise
of an effective Customs duty, Melbourne
and Sydney people have been encouraged to
put in money and buy more brains and skill,
and there is a reasonable prospect that here
Australia will make for itself a whole lot
of the things hitherto made for us by people
who used the money to buy ammunition to
shoot us with.
“Socialist” seems vexed : —•
I’m rapidly getting to the conclusion that the
biggest humbug on earth is the all-wool Socialist
unionist —the sort that will swear on the smallest
provocation that he hates the Bloated Capitalist worse
than watered beer, and is ready to blither at any
time about State Enterprise and the Good of the
Masses. He invariably votes State Socialism —-or as
much of it as the ridiculous Party system will allow
him. Awhile back the N.S.W. Government proposed
to give him a bit of it and hang out a small,
timorous shingle in the bread-making business, with
the idea of purveying a cheaper loaf than the Pri-
vate Enterprise article. Did the alleged Socialist-
unionist enthuse? No fear! The Bakers’ Operatives’
Union jumped with all its feet on the scheme; it
would “throw men out of employment.” Their
troubles about the “masses” —the good old “masses”
on whose account they have shed so many troughs
of salt tears! A bit farther back, when the total-
isator was a little more threatening than usual, it
was the Clerks’ Union’s turn. The clerks’ worries
about the hospitals. The machine “would throw many
bookmakers' pencillers out of work” —so damn it 1
ANOTHER INFERNAL MACHINE.
The N. S. Wales Labor Confereuce passed a reso-
lution calling for immediate steps to secure the
closing of hotels at 6 p.m.
The Broken Hill Prop, is bringing to
Australia, under contract, expert craftsmen
for its new steel and iron works. Permis-
sion to do this was granted by the Federal
Government because this country, having
been content to buy its iron and steel from
the foreigner, has no skilled workmen on the
premises. _ The wages the imported people
will receive give an idea of the value of
skilled industries. Rollers will get from £33 to
£52 a month and melters £57 55., and other
workers will draw from 16s. to £1 12s. per
day. Three pounds a week is a good average
wage for the Australian workman, whose
political friends have been careful to keep
him mostly a hewer of wood and a drawer
of water.
THE EXPLANATION.
Mr. Fisher will also explain his strategic railway
proposals to the Premiers’ Conference —News item.
AUSTRALIA: “Those little crosses that look
like lots of little voles , what are they for? ”
FISHER: “They are—er—um—they are the
strategic points."
A Melbourne manufacturer, encouraged by
the war, has commenced the manufacture of
“Vienna” chairs on a large scale. Customs
Minister Tudor has inspected the business,
and intends to see that it is properly pro-
tected. “This,” moans the S. M. Herald,
“is apparently his answer to the deputation
which asked for a reduction of the duty on
chairs.” It is a refreshingly good answer,
anyway.
The three trawlers which Holman per-
sisted in importing from England in spite of
the Labor policy and the protests of N.S.W.
artisans who wanted the work for them-
selves, and of good Australians who abhor
the importing habit, have grown into six.
The Government intends to establish six
fish-distributing centres in the State; and
in unfolding this scheme (which is good in
itself) Chief Secretary Black mentioned “the
six trawlers which left Grimsby for Sydney
on February 15.” Holman gave a fairly
definite promise, when attacked about order-
ing three of the vessels abroad, that the
rest of the fleet should be made locally; but
his Government seems to have bought the
extra trawlers from sheer delight of out-
raging his party’s platform in as many
places as possible.
According to the Argus (7/4/T5) :
Mr. Mahon occasionally entertains excellent ideas.
The nationalisation of the drink traffic in Northern
Territory is not one of them ; the proposal to induce
returned soldiers to settle in the Territory after
the war is one. There is no reason, as Australia
will owe much to these soldiers, why Australia
should not pay the debt with grants of land in the
Territory.
The Tory sheet, as the mouthpiece of the
party which pretends to believe that only
the cheap nigger is able to stand the
allegedly terrible climate of the Territory,
thus cheerfully gives away the party game.
It can conceive no more fitting reward for
those who have served the Empire than a
grant of land in a part of the continent
where its political allies have for years been
shouting that white men cannot possibly
live !
“Scallywag” from the inside :
The service is dead tired of reading references to
the magnificent administrative abilities of the
lately-retired Carmichael, N. S. Wales Minister for
Education. T could fill 20 pages with instances of
rotten administration. Here are enough to go into
the available 20 lines.
This year he awarded scholarships entitling hoys
and girls to admission to High Schools, and found
out—later —that he had given 800 more than he
could provide books for. Of course the books will
come from England, arriving here when the hum-,
bugged students have done the best part of their
year’s work.
He obliged teachers to live in insanitary, cramped
dwellings; and if they couldn’t live in them, he
deducted the rent from their screw. One old teacher
(30 years in the service) has 15s. per week deducted
from his salary as rent for a house which he is not
living in, cannot live in, and has utterly failed to
find a tenant for at 10s. per week.
He paid foreign failures £250 to £3OO p.a. as
High School teachers, while those within the service
got from £lBO to £2OO p.a.
Under him the Department kept down expenses by
declaring a man inefficient just when he was due for
promotion. No teacher was given any reason why
he was “inefficient”; and 80 per cent, of the
“inefficients” were men and women who had earned
promotion by examination.
But this was his stroke of genius. He constituted,
within his own Department, an “Information
Bureau,” whose duty it was to provide newspaper
reporters with accounts of the marvellous work and
prospects of Carmichael and his Department. This
boosting bureau has been a huge success. In fact,
its chief clerk accompanied the boss on his travels,
and sat beside him in the aeroplane in which he in-
spected the schools of Europe.
There seems to be no doubt that Henry
M'illis. the Napoleonic person who held the
N. S. Wales Speakership, for a space, amid
a cataract of books, ink bottles, curses and
howls; who stilled the shrill scream of
Colonel Onslow and quelled the native
violence of W. 11. Wood and Danny
Levy; who taught the Assembly more
about the fine points of Parlia-
mentary procedure than it had ever dreamed
of; and who was finally defeated in his con-
stituency—there seems to he no doubt that
this latter-day Outcast of Poker’s Flat, Mac-
quarie-street, Middle Harbor, the Hunter and
elsewhere is to be made an M.L.C. Holman
promised him the distinction for services
rendered, and, whatever his other faults may
be, Holman stands by his friends. The re-
surgement of Willis will be a pity. He had
just begun to develop into a Myth. In a
place where no one screams or gets noisily
drunk or blasphemes or casts the furniture
about, he will be merely an anomaly. The
bird that has been wont to ride the storm is
of no use to anyone in a fowl-house. To do
its qualities justice it needs, at the least,
scope and a tempest. If Willis is not to
become an anti-climax the Government
should send with him to the House of Re-
pose, say, Fitzpatrick, or Cohen, in addition
to two or three of the Assembly’s leading
drunks. With no one to rebuke, Willis will be
dull and ordinary and banal —everything
that his grateful fellow countrymen have
learned not to expect of him.
THE AMENDED TOAST.
“Gev'men, his Mask Crash' Maj'sty er King
an the cause tem-tunprmce! [?]!"
The Council of Caulfield (Vic.) has get
into holts with Lands Minister Lawson, and
there may, if the latter sticks to his'guns,
be a brisk engagement presently. The
Council has some sort of control over the
local park, and decided that a slice of it,
which a football club mostly monopolises,
would be the better of a fence, to “keep chil-
dren from wandering into danger among the
players.” The fence it put up was solid
enough to stop a wild bull, was Bft. high and
topped with barbed wire. It also boasted a
gate, and the carpenter who erected it thor-
oughly realised the situation by inserting a
small pigeon-hole for the receipt of custom.
Lawson went and saw the thing and ordered
the Council to remove it. The Council de-
clined to do so; whereupon Lawson swears
lie’ll have the fence down. It is to be hoped he
will stick to his swear, because nothing would
give the local populace more joy than to see
a dozen stout councillors defending their
barbed-wire entanglement, while the youth
of the place bombarded them with tomatoes
and other ammunition. It is astonishing
that no sooner do citizens acquire a slice of
land for recreation than somebody straight-
way sets out to steal some of it. Why not
give the public’s land a rest and try to steal
some from private owners?
THE WISDOM OF THE OLD CROW.
The N. S. Wales Cabinet yesterday decided to set
apart 5,000,000 acres in various parts of the State for
forestry reserves. Certain areas will be planted if neces-
sary. The whole scheme, however, is still in
embryo.— News item.
THE YOUNG B IRD: “Oh, mother! Are they
really going to plant us a lovely new
forest? ”
THE OLD B IRD: “ Don't believe it, my dear,
till you see ’em with the tools.”
Having a Protective tariff, with a super-
tariff to apply to hoggish nations, Canada
doesn’t rely solely on primary industries, and
can give the Empire a valuable hand now in
arming itself. Several of the Dominion s
engineering firms are making shrapnel shells
and other unpleasant ironmongery; and
Toronto yards are working double shifts on
shipbuilding contracts. Australia, under a
revenue tariff, remains a hewer of wood and
drawer of water, and this year there is pre-
cious little water to draw, while the wood-
hewing business is overdone. Australian
State Ministries, it is true, are working
double time ; but that is at the job ot trying
to bite Colien for more loan.
THE PRIZE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Now who will bring me Paris?’’ said the Kaiser to
his host
In the harvest days of August when the troop trains
rattled by;
And the Captain of the Legions muttered: “Paris,
please, or, toast,
And produce the morsel swiftly! We have other
fish to fry.”
So the legions went to fetch it, and the battle
trumpets blew,
While the Kaiser watched their progress down the
loud and dusty tracks,
Till a large and angry person came distinctly into
view,
And he saw that it was Paris—hefty Paris with an
axe.
“Now who will bring me London ?” said the Kaiser
to his men
In the wild November morning as the shells were
heard to sing;
And the Captain of the Legions with a useful foun-
tain-pen
Wrote the order: “Bring us London, for the Kaiser
wants the thing.
“You will find it sitting smoking just across the
narrow sea
With a football-match in progress and a beef-pump
going strong,
And the excellent umbrellas of the Peace Societee
Are the recognised defences that have kept it safe so
long.”
So the legions went to fetch it, and the Kaiser
watched them go
I p the long canals of Flanders till they neared the
narrow sea,
And the bogged and noisy cannon met each other in
a row,
While the gentle folk of Calais seemed expecting
them to tea.
Then the Prussian Guard, whose glory was as shining
as the sun,
Made a rush across the trenches that appeared to
do the trick,
Till a little piece of London caught its valor on the
run,
And the part that wasn’t corpses hadn’t breath
enough to kick.
“Ach, won’t some one bring me something?” said
the Kaiser in dismay—
Almost any kind of trifle would be coin orting just
now.
Kitchener has armies making that may find me any
day,
And the bear of all the Russias is behaving like a
cow.
“But won’t someone bring me something e'er the
final trumpet blows,
E’er the battle turns in earnest and the smoke has
crossed the Rhine —
Just a souvenir to cherish of the way we smote our
foes,
When I really was ambitious and creation looked
like mine.”
Then beneath the briny water crept a noiseless
submarine,
Hiding deep amid the seaweed, choked and blind,
but full of hope,
And on rare occasions lifting, when it thought it
was not seen,
From the surface of the ocean its affrighted periscope.
But it brought the Kaiser gladness at the end of
many days,
And a proud man was its captain when ho bore in
triumph back
Out of range of death and slaughter, ’mid the loud,
imperial praise,
The torpedoed wreck and remnant of a Grimsby
fishing smack !

SPORTING
NOTIONS
John Wren sent a message to the Sydney
Tattersall Club crowd who were drinking- wine at
iris expense on account of his having done the, Don-
caster Handicap trick with gee-gee Carlin. Wren
hadn’t the face to turn up and say it himself, but
he commissioned his “representative” to say, in
response to the usual “Jolly Good Fellow” speech,
that he was not in favor of the totalisator. The
Bulletin makes the wowsers, the rooks and the
lkeys a present of Jack Wren’s solemn declaration.
The noble army of sharps and saints can have John
for their star recruit if they want him. lie is the
most humorous thing in converts that ever breathed.
As the proprietor of an illicit tote at Collingwood
(Melb.) Wren made tons of money—out of the local
working man for the most part. With the lawless
shop came a plague of the very sort of all-the-week
gambling which a lawful tote would abolish. And
when at last his system of barbed-wire defences,
etc., was no longer able to keep the Collingwood
scandal going, Wren put his money into pony race-
courses. To-day he draws a large income from
unregistered race meetings, where the tote will cer-
tainly not be licensed if turf reform comes to pass.
The machine was never intended to benefit individual
proprietors of racecourses who pouch the profits of
their circus shows, and are understood to have a
commanding interest in the principal “book” made
on their premises. Therefore converted John is an
ardent opponent of the tote. So ardent that he
couldn’t keep o.uiet about it. He had to advertise
the way his influence is working.
Sydney Tattersall’s Club meeting at
Randwick on Saturday provided yet another explana-
tion of the reason why bookmakers don’t use trams.
With but one successful favorite (and that a six to
four chance in a field of 21) backers must have
dropped enough during the afternoon to pay for the
upkeep for about 10 years of as many motor-cars as
there are bookmakers in the Ma State. Colugo, the
lonely animal which was picked to win the Youthful
Stakes by so many that the next favorite stood
at 10’s, is a superb chestnut colt that looks capable
of humping any burden. He is by The Welkin out
of'bn imported mare, and was bred by Ernest Clarke,
the naval brother of Rupert.
A disgraceful feature was the performance of Moon
on Flute I’layer in the Hurdle Race. The public
backed Flute Player down to seven to two. The
unhappy brute never had a shadow of a chance —in
fact, it dropped into second-last place at an early
stage and stayed there to the finish-—but Moon con-
sidered apparently that he was called on to make
a demonstration. He accordingly rode a series Of
gallery finishes long after it should have been obvious
to him that he had no more hope of getting a place
than he had of lumping the grandstand. Flute
Player came in streaming with blood. The stewards
turned the rider down for a month. What they
should have done was to forbid him ever to ’ wear
spurs again on courses controlled by them. Dpnimv
spurs are good enough for the rider who doesn’t
understand the need of sparing a beaten horse. The
trainer, by the way, was also fined £5 'crjr. id. or
something for his association with this event.
The Malster mare, Lady Denman, did the
appropriate thing by winning the Denman- Stakes.
She went out nominally at eights, but actually at
any figure in reason, so sure was Moses, on her
rather barren record of late, of her uselessness.
The Cup was won by Tartanus, from Narivo,
by a short head. It was the most interest-
ing race of a dull day. Narivo, the recent winner
of the A.J.C. Citv Handicap, was turned out in great
form by Paddy Nolan, and might have just got home
had Maher noticed the challenge of Tartanus a
fraction of a second earlieT-7" Kingsburgh, the Mel-
bourne Cup winner, finished third, beaten to the
world.
Of £36,895 distributed at the A.J.C. four
days’ meeting, N.S.W. owners pocketed £27,408,
Victorians £6038, Maorilanders £2749, and
Westralians £7OO. With nine races worth over
£lOOO each, there were some solid winnings. 11.
Berry (£.4201). A. G. White (£3322), and G.
Barnett ( £3042) were at the head of the list. It
was the greatest splash in A.J.C. history ; but, owing
to bad weather and postponements, the club will be
lucky if it scrapes out of the venture with much
profit.
* * * *
Grafton, the stud horse wl>:ch turned up
his hoofs last week, left a big legacy in Australian
blood stock. A figure-fiend tabulates that in 15 years
Grafton’s descendants won 1587 races, worth
£204,349 in cash. He headed the list of winning
stallions in 1904, 1907, 1908 and 1909.

Mountain Knight, the Australian cham-
pion tliree-year-old, for whom £2lO was paid as a

“Moana”: The weakest spot about the
tote is its habit of being so beastly frank. After
every day’s racing in Maoriland the papers state
that “the sum of £98,735 passed through the total-
isator at yesterday,” or words to that effect.
But with Isaac McShortodds the whole punting
business is hidden away in a capacious bag. So
when the fight for the tote is won the opposition to
it won’t cease. It will go on for years. Even where
the machine is firmly established parsons are con-
tinually rising up to denounce it as “the device of
the Devil.” This because, when parsondom sees that
£98,735 was put through the machine the day
before, it promptly divides the sum into thruppences
and works out how many collection-plates would be
required to accommodate this vast amount and how
many churchwardens would be wanted to carry the
spoil round to the vestry. And most of this is
because the tote stands out in the light and shows
exactly what it is doing.

The racehorses in England belonging to
the Austrian sportsman Prince Ivinsky were sold
recently under license from the Home Secretary,
but the “enemy profits” fund isn’t much the richer.
If the animals had the plague they couldn’t have
brought much less. One, which had been entered for
numerous races, was* knocked down at 11 guineas!
N.S.W. took on a big contract when it
put four tennis teams on the courts to meet Victoria,
South Aus., Queensland and Tasmania, proceeds to
go to the Belgian Fund. But unfortunately for Bel-
gium, Isaac Moses was also howling for relief at
Randwick ; and the Nose had it. Consequently the
amount of hard seat at Double Bay that wasn’t cov-
ered with spectator was painfully large; and the
“gate” was correspondingly small. Those who
did abandon Moses to his cruel fate had the plea-
sure of seeing- N.S.W. sweep the board. Victoria’s un-
representative team was badly beaten —the only man
who made a decent showing on paper being Camp-
bell, who beat A. U. Jones. This is the 55t;h time
the two States have met, and the win puts Ma on
top, 28 to 27. Likewise were Queensland, S.A. and
Tasmania shockingly handled by their hosts. The
Victorian ladies got much nearer victory, but gave
way to Ma’s representatives—6 sets 15 rubbers 142
games, to 6 sets 15 rubbers 139 games. The cham-
pionship tournament, which runs the whole of this
week with the finals on Saturday, threatens to add a
more respectable cheque to the Belgian Fund, especi-
ally as there is a fine assortment of inter-State
players to make things interesting, and also as the.
before-mentioned Isaac Moses will not be in need of
further relief for a week or two.
Western Suburbs showed its consistent
opinion of North Sydney in the cricket field on Satur-
day, when, for the second time this season, Austin
Diamond’s XI defeated the men from over the
channel, and thereby won the first-grade champion-
ship. It was a straight-out win (nine wickets), which
landed the three points needed by the Westerners to
bring home the cured pork. The five leading teams
ran out this way: Western Suburbs, 68 points ; North
Sydney, 62 points; Sydney, 61 points; Glebe and
Gordon, 54 points each. University, which won the
competition last year, was sixth on the list.
In Sydney’s cricket contest for the first-grade
pennant, just concluded, W. Bardsley (Glebe) headed
the batting averages with 66.88 runs; aggregate, 602
runs ; highest score. 146. The bowling averages were
topped by J. D. Scott (Petersham) with 45 wickets
for 387 runs —8.60.

R- V. Minnett, one of a trio of N.S.W.
cricketing brothers, landed at Sydney station on
Saturday after having escaped uninjured from the
train smash on the Melbourne line, and hurried on to
St. Luke’s Park to play for North Sydney in the
final pennant match. The railway collision was a sort
of practice for the Great Collision in Europe. R. V.
leaves Sydney by the Morea on Saturday, and will
join the Army Medical Corps.

V tutorial! Cricket Association, having
turned down the eight-ball-to-the-over “reform,”
which N.S.W. was anxious to see adopted, inter-State
cricket next season will be conducted as hitherto.
Via, however, will give the innovation a trial in grade

intei-State football match against Queensland. In
later years and to the present generation, he has
been piobably the soundest referee in the game He
has been a member of the Union for 35 years, and
has held every office. The late J. J. Calvert filled
the chair for over 40 years, and thereby left a
substantial record for any successor to rub out.
“Touch”: The N.S.W. Rugby League
seems to have chilled feet about its programme-
despite-the-war policy. The commencement of the
season has been put back a week, from April 24 to
May i, on account of the march through Sydney
streets of the 5000 troops forming Ma’s quota for
the next Expeditionary Force. From the'way the
League first, talked, it seemed as if it thought that
its hoofball was really superior in interest to the
war, but apparently it isn’t game to test its hold
on the “gate” against Australian soldiers on the
march.

When Granville (N.S.W.) Soccer foot-

they found that a State record of wins had been piled
together. These were the Gardiner Cup and N.S.W.
championship, Rawson Cup and honors caps, and the
six-a-side competition. When they talk about
Granville as a soccer recruiting ground they spell it
Grandville.

A. Rollinson won the half-mile profes-
sional swimming championship of N. S. Wales on
Saturday in 12min. 43sec. He was dilatory. Amongst
the pros., Billington, of Londoti, has been more
expeditious by lmin. 6sec., and Barney Kiernan has
been livelier still—llmin. 11 3-ssec. And he was a
mere amateur.

Amendments to the record books were re-
cently made at Chicago during the Amateur Athletic
Unions Swimming championship meeting. Michael
McDermott cut the 100yds. and 200yds. breast-stroke
times to lmin. 13 2-ssec. and 2min. 38 2-ssec. re-
spectively. Perry McGillivray, in the 250yds. open
swim, pulled the time down to 2min. 50 Lssec. and
travelled 300yds. in 3min. 26 l-ssec. The USA
record of limin. 29 l-ssec. for the 880yds., credited
to G. M. Daniels, was sponged out by Harry Ilebner
who put up llmin. 14 l-ssec. in its place. In cover-
ing the distance, Ilebner broke no less than 10 U.S.
records, commencing at 330vds.
Bilf S.st. 10]])., Bash Bst. 10|1b.,” bawled
1 ie master of ceremonies, indicating two youths in
the ring at Sydney Stadium, and crawled away
through the ropes. They looked very lonely, these
boys, m the fierce light which beats on the meeting
place of so many pugs. “Shake hands,’’ said the
referee. They shook. “Box on!’’ Biff slid quickly
into position. Inside lOsec. he wished he was ill
rlandeis, for Bash had cut loose with the vim of
a healthy tornado. To the unhappy Biff the atmo-
sphere seemed full of gloves hitting him from everv
angle with rude violence. One to the jaw, another to
the place where liis dinner was—a flush on the nose.
Bill pawed feebly in reply, weathered storm number
one, and sank into his corner with a shattered mouth
and trembling with a sense of outrage. Bash glared
from over the way. “Why the Devil don’t you push
your left out?” hoarsely, demanded the man with
Impressions at the State Amateur
Championships.
the sponge. “O Lord!” panted the harassed Biff.
Then he added: “Put the towel in"- —and in it went.
He turned it up without shame, a. likely-looking
youngster, too, firmly built and lithe. Bash stalked
to the dressing-room with the proud step of a
conqueror.
“Smash—Dash.” The next pair of feathers were
introduced. “Box on,” and for a couple of rounds
they pranced around and tapped one another harm-
lessly. “Go in and hit him, and keep going,” whis-
pers the guide, philosopher and friend of Smash;
and as gong calls he leaps for the fray. Dash’s nose
springs quickly a-leak and a hostile glove plasters
the gore in a sticky mass across his face. Bang
comes the brown weapon again, for Smash is still
going in, and Dash takes it on the neck, staggers in
his tracks, droops just a little —then bang some more.
Dash’s head smacks the board. He is comfortable
now, at any rate, and dreams he can faintly hear
someone counting 10 away on the Western Plains.
“Out” comes in a mighty chorus. Someone helps
him up, gives him a drink, and, grinning" feebly
round, he looks for the apparition of Smash. But
that purposeful youth has skipped smilingly away to
bask' in the sunshine of victory.
And so they come on, one pair after another, to*
compete for the amateur boxing championships pf
N. S. Wales. Some are painfully crude —so crude in
a few eases that there seems to be need. fpr some
restraint in receiving nominations. Others show
form which varies from fair to promising; and in
every ease a frantic anxiety not only to win, but to
get there by the K.O. route: can be noticed—a grave
weakness this with an amateur of only moderate
skill. Time after time there were bouts in which
the obvious winner exhausted and discounted himself
by a feverish hunt after the other fellow’s point.,
The show is vastly amusing at times. There was
more fun at the Stadium on the night a Bulletin
Jnan wandered in than he had seen in Sydney for
many a day. They box in all shapes and styles,
these amateurs, from the long and the short to the
serio-comic. Mosquito and Peanut are summoned.
“Box on!”—and before the exhortation has ceased
the gallant bantams are tied in a knot, their writh-
ing frames the very embodiment of Stoush demented
to the last degree of willingness. For 60 frenzied
seconds the battle rages without let-up. Then a
chance blow brings Mosquito down ; and Peanut, like
Cortes on the lonely peak in Darien, looks pantinglv
down. lie sets Mosquito at his feet —in his ears the
sound of choral music. Happy Peanut! He will
light in the welter-class next. year.
“Hooray!” roared the crowd, and sat up like
kids, at a pantomime. Streak and Freak were ap-
proaching one another with the exaggerated delib-
eration of automatons —Streak, his hair correctly
parted, and most becomingly' attired ; Freak, nearly
Oft. of him, inside a loose and ancient bathing suit,

notice of his intention, passed out a punch much in
the manner of a lackadaisical duchess serving an ice-
cream. Freak deftly flicked it aside, gravely smacked
Streak over the jaw, stepped about 7ft. away in one
stride, and opened his face into a wide, inviting
smile. The audience rocked with glee and howled
encouragement. ■ Streak came to call again with
more suddenness, but in stepping up to knock at
the front door ran into a dark lump of leather
which, being abruptly shot forward, made point of
collision between the eyes. Stung by this mishap
into retaliatory fury, Streak administered Freak an
emphatic smack on the left cheek ; but instead of
finding the right then turned towards him for
attention, himself took a jolt in the midriff. (Loud
applause.) Streak went back to his corner wonder-
ing whether his friend was a take-down. Freak sim-
ply chewed away at his gum, looked affably round,
and had a slice of lemon. As a turn at one of the
theatres this bout would have a place all to itself
on the bill. Freak hopped about like an animated
lathe, with a mingling of mournfulness and amia-
bility in his bearing so queer as to be inimitable.
In the intervals the dejected Streak was urged to
get in to close quarters; and though he struggled
manfully to do this the elusive batliing-suit either
leaped away or disdainfully pushed him off by' the
eye. It was the most popular item of the evening,
and the verdict, “Freak the winner,” was received
with resounding cheers. Freak, still industriously
chewing, vanished gloomily and alone.
* * * *
The smartest exhibition of boxing seen
between lightweights for many a day in Sydney was
given by Jack Clune and Jimmy Hill at the Stadium
on Saturday. Hill brought into the ring, besides a
little extra poundage, all that exceptional skill by
which his long mastery in the feather division had
been sustained. Clune has greatly improved, and
Hill, whcr started out with undisguised confidence and
the customary, jsWitrffc, qdickly found himself with a
much inoTe- difficult proposition on hand that he
bargained for. dune’s left was a disturbing feature
of the proceedings, and Hill ran into it oftener than
was good for him. On the other hand, Hill’s light-
ning-like counter with the right was for a time
mightily disturbing to Clune. But as the fray pro-
gressed Clune beat this form of assault, and at the
eighth had that portion of Hill’s equipment nicely
measured up. Both men at times miss'ed badly, but
in each case the failure was due more to the brilliant
foot and head work of the other fellow than to serious
mistake on the part of the smiter. The hitting was
well and truly delivered, but with a difference. When
Clune' hit he smote with effect, of. which the sudden
backward* jolt of Hill’s head gave frequent evidence.
It was a Hill moving in who took such biff as came
his. way—it was a backward-shifting Clune who
absorbed his share. Clune had taken three rounds in
succession up to the twelfth, and then the end
came. A quick uppercut with the right took Hill
square under the chin and lifted him flat on his
back. At nine he moved, but heard “out” come
before reaching his feet, and the bacon was Chine’s.
* * * *
The interminable argument between
Herb McCoy' and Frank Thorne was continued at Bris-
bane Stadium on Saturday night. The bone of con-
tention this time was the lightweight championship
of Australia, and' at the end of an hour’s fighting
(20 rounds) the ring-magistrate-found.lor the holder,
McCoy, with costs on the higher scale. The crowd
said it couldn’t have given a better verdict itself.
Probably Clune will get the next chance to snatch
the title from McQoy.

Tommy McCarty, the Irish-Ameriean
who led Colin Bell through a 10-rounds bout on
Saturday at New York, is half an inch taller than the
Australian heavyweight and six years younger—23
against Bell's 29. He has a long list of small
knock-outs to his credit. Bell has not done so well,
but he has done it in much better company.
“Rastus” : The instinct of the race holds
true. The cable announces that Jack Johnson, de-
feated by Jess Willard, has left Cuba via Mar-
tinique for France, where lie will take to raising
chickens.
IT. Martis, of Wanganui (M.L.), is
credited with having raged over the 100yds. last
week, at the Mart on Athletic Club’s sports, in
9 3-ssec. Maybe ; but before swallowing the time
The Bulletin* would like to know how many
watches there were and what experience their
holders had. Every now and then there comes along
breathless information of a runner cutting out the
hundred in 9 3-ssec., but verification appears to
fall down dead by the wayside. Incidentally,
track experts are arguing as to whether, in 9 3-ssee.,
man has reached his limit for the hundred. The
bulk of opinion seems to be that he has. It is true
that A. B. Postle made the journey in Australia at
Christmas time, 1906, in 91sec., but the running
was downhill (3ft. drop). Also, three timers swore
to 9 l-ssec. by B. P. Williams (pro.), at New
London, Connecticut. (U.S.A.), in 1905, and officials
of Tokio University took their affidavit that a
scholar named Minoru Fujii, on a grass track, in
1902, made 9 2-ssec. ; but, rightly or wrongly, doubt
roosts on both performances.

After all the groanings of the print-
ing press and the elaborate organisa-
tion of foreign correspondents, how little
the world knew! When the war started
the British belief in Russia and France was
only equalled by the immense opinion of
England held by Russia and France. Rus-
sia was the steam-roller that would go
slowly forward and crush all opposition;
France was unexpectedly prepared and could
hit hard and soon. Even Belgium was hold-
ing its own, and everybody was amazed
when Liege and Namur crumpled up. The
only country which hadn’t the vestige of a
hope was Servia. Yet Servia, in proportion
to its possibilities, and considering its posi-
tion, has done the best of all, and its people
will have respect as fighting men as long
as there is a pig left in the country to feed.
The N. S. Wales Cullens, represented in
the front seats nowadays by the Chief Jus-
tice and Lieutenant-Governor, though much
given to church-going, never could quite
make up their minds which church was the
right one. The Methodist described the
C.J.’s father as “a portly, well-set-up North
of Ireland man, of fair education and good
presence, and a preacher of parts....He
seceded from Methodism to establish a ‘Free
Gospel Church,’ which, however, did not long
survive.” The Chief lias a brother who was
a Congregational minister, but deserted the
pulpit for the press and Parliament. He
represented St. Leonards for a time, and is
now a journalist in Westralia. The C.J.
nailed himself down more or less by marry-
ing into the Dean Cowper family.

Why an
Eight-Cylinder Cadillac?
Because
the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac does more of
the things which a motorist wants his
car to do.
Because
the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac does things
with greater ease and with the expendi-
ture of less mental effort and less physical
effort on the part of the driver.
Because
the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac does those
things without intruding its mechanical
self upon driver or passengers.
Because
the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac possesses an
abundance of reserve power, instantly
available.
Because
the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac will run more
slowly on direct drive in crowded streets
and congested traffic, and will do it with-
out expert manipulation.
And it will “pick up” from slow run-
ning without hesitation or tremor.
Because
the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac surmounts
hills better and with less apparent effort.
Because
the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac negotiates bad
roads better, more easily, with less atten-
tion from the operator and with greater
comfort to the passengers.
Because
with the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac the
motorist experiences less fatigue on long
journeys.
Because
with the Eight-Cylinder Cadillac, every
enjoyment of motoring is intensified.
Because
the Eight-Cylinder Y-Type principle, with
the absence of vibration and steady appli-
cation of power, coupled with Cadillac
ideals and Cadillac methods of execution,
lends itself to long life and enduring
service.
Because
as we said at the outset, the Eight-
Cylinder Cadillac does more of the things
which a motorist wants his car to do;
it does them better, it does them more
easily, and it does them in a manner
which permits one to enjoy to the utmost
the things which contribute to motoring's
pleasures.
Finally
your first ride will compel you to dismiss
from your mind completely, the question:

That doesn’t mean that nothing at all was
written off last year. Ordinary wear and
tear is provided for annually ; all the plant
and other property is valued every year, and
tlie items written down accordingly. The
wear and tear is pretty serious. Last year,
for instance, though over £2OOO was spent
on repairs, the outfit with which the co.
started on January 1 was reckoned to be
worth £8857 more than it was on December
31. Taking all things into a'ccount, the net
profit for the 12 months was astonishingly
good. The co. pokes up and down the
rivers, carting wool, etc., and hawking mer-
chandise ; and the rivers were open only for
a few weeks in the whole period. As for
trade off the river, the back country has
been feeling too sick to spend an avoidable
ha’penny; and, unless this co. had extra-
ordinary luck, the high price of fodder must
have cut into its profits. But it has gone
through all this and still shows net earnings
of more than 10 p.c. on capital; so the pro-
spects in the good years that are coming
for the back country are very cheerful in-
deed.

Like every concern which has much truck
with the sheep or wheat cocky, P., W. & Co.
have , to give a good deal of credit ; and as
their own capital is only £50,000, and as
their plant and stable and office property,
etc., run into almost that amount, P., W. &
Co. have to go into debt to somebody else in
order that the sheep and wheat cocky may
go into debt to them. The figures are, how-
ever, not at all appalling, and might reason-
ably have been much worse than they are
after two such years as the inlands have
had.

The directors don’t mention the war. Will
self-respecting shareholders put up with it?
Is everybody else to pose as a sufferer and a
martyr and not they? However, let them
console themselves with their old familiar
£8 17s. 9d. p.c., though things have to be cut
very fine to pay it. As against that skimp-
ing there was a special, non-recurring outlay
of £6OO last half-year—a vote to the widow
of the late secretary. A few years ago,
when Gillies started on his scheme to har-
ness up the power of the Great Lake and
provide Hobart with energy for big metal-
lurgical works, this co. rubbed its eyes out of
a long sleep. For years it had been pre-
tending to be an electric-light as well as a
gas co.; but it was only pretence. Gillies’s
co. got into difficulties afterwards, and
handed over to this co. its brisrht hopes of
lighting Hobart. Subsequently the Govern-
ment took over some other parts of the
scheme. Plainly, with this dangerous com-
petitor about, it was no time for this co. to
go on sleeping. Hence in the past four
years over £20,000 has been spent on capital
account in the gas department, and over
£40,000 on the electric light side. About
£40.000 of the money has been raised on
debentures and overdraft; only £9OOO has
come from shareholders. Up till then there
were practically no liabilities. Some day
Tasmania may wake, up and Hobart may
become the great seaport city Nature cut it
out for. Meantime, while it is dodging
along in its slow old way. this co.’s dividends
are likely to stay up in their present neigh-
borhood, though, with Launceston’s example
at the other end of the island, it seems
equally certain that Hobart will never put
up with high enough lighting and power
charges to increase the present rate of divi-
dend by much. Shareholders will have quite
as much luck as most people get if they hold
what they have.

“Muttaburra”: lie the importation of
Californian oil-drilling rigs and crews.
“Queenslander” is quite right, and there is
no confusion of oil and water drillers about
it. Anyway, boring for either oil or water
means only the working of a glorified crow-
bar. the machinery being more or less
powerful, according to depth. A well-known
Rockhampton foundry holds patents for
several inventions in boring, and there are
at least half a dozen firms in Australia that
could supply all the rigs required at once.
As for crews, oil-boring countries have been
looking for them here before to-day.

is reduced to the minimum.
No digging the hole about four times the
size of the post, which is the custom with a
shovel.
The average man can dig 120 Post Holes in
a day with one of these Diggers, each one
the same size, and made to suit the post,
leaving little ramming to be done.

A Noted
Hair Specialist.
There is a clever young English scientist, Margaret
Windeyer, practising her profession of hair and skin
specialist in Sydney, who is going to cause a stir
in this sunny land of ours by the extraordinary things
that she is doing- for the hair. She practises what is
known as the Thorl system of hair culture, under
which falling hair, even if it is coming out in hand-
fuls, as it often does, is stopped within a week or so,
and made firm in the scalp. The dandruff germ is
entirely cleared away so that it cannot return.
Thin, weak, short, broken, decayed hair is made to
spring into life and grow thick, long, strong and
beautiful. It is worthy of note, too, that this re-
markable system of hair culture has the power of
growing thick, healthy, firm hair upon scalps that
have been bald and bare of hair for many years.
The most amazing feature about it is that it entirely
cures grey hair, that is, it brings the natural
original color back to the greyest, whitest hair,
irrespective of whether the hair has been grey since
one was in one’s teens, or whether it is absolutely
all grey, or half or three-parts grey, or just going
gre.v. To have the lost color brought back to one’s
grey hair so that never again in the coming years
of one’s life can a single thread go grey, to be cured
of our baldness, falling hair, dandruff, etc., to have
our hair given such a start that it’ll just go on
growing thicker and longer year after year without
a bit of bother, worry or expense—that seems to us
to be the kind of relief that is worth seeking and
obtaining with all speed. Nearly the whole of the
first floor of the Bank of N.S.W., 228 Pitt Street
(opposite Palace Theatre), has been taken for this
young Englishwoman’s laboratories, consulting r,ooms,
etc., and it is pleasing to know that consultations
with her are free. There are private separate and
exclusive waiting-rooms for men folk and for women.
Country dwellers who send a few combings to Miss
Windeyer to be examined under the microscope will
be written to, free of charge, explaining what is
wrong with their hair and the cost of complete per-
manent cure. Her address: Margaret Windeyer, Hair
and Skin Specialist, Bank of N.S.W. (first floor), 228

“Kuscobin”: I lere is a sample of
that Gerliog thoroughness which it is
blind folly to dismiss with a cheap
and small-minded scoff. As soon as
they had made Belgium their own
particular sty, they brought up meteorolo-
gists, and supplied them with field observa-
tories. With very little in the way of
appliances trained folk have long been able
to forecast a next-morning from the day-
before. By means of stationary kites a fog
can just as easily be forecasted —and that’s
worth knowing in these days of mechanical
flight. Notice the weather at the time of
German air-craft raids —you’ll find most of
them have occurred during fogs. The next
thing we’ll be offering is a meteorological
corps. Clement Wragge would go, perhaps,
if you allowed him a thermometer and a
press agent or two. In fact, at a pinch, he
might not mind going without the ther-
mometer. And if he’s too busy now with
his pineapples, there are 10,000 Australian
Imshmen who could take his place if you’d
let them carry along their ants and dies and
other forecasting implements.
"Gordon G.” on the gentle art of jury-
squaring. and how it is not done: —
A shady client goes to a shady solicitor with his
troubles. The shady solicitor tells him it’s a rotten
case, and, as such, one for desperate measures. Jury-
squaring is mentioned, and the game commences. The
shady client hands over to the shady solicitor (say)
L 200, to be judiciously'distributed in a good cause.
Whereupon the shady solicitor considers the position
fully and sums up thus: “Risks are dangerous and
ought to be avoided. By distributing this money I
shall be running a risk of being found out and a
risk of suffering dire consequences. Also, I shall be
running a. further risk of not being paid (or, at
least, of not being paid adequately) for my trouble
in taking risk No. 1. This client of mine is a very
wicked man, and should be punished for attempting
to commit bribery. I think I will keep this money
—I need it badly. Three things may happen to him
on his trial — (1) he may be acquitted, (2) the jury
may disagree, (3) lie may be convicted. In cases
(1) and (2) I can assure him that his good fortune
was the result of my assiduous labors, and quite pos-
sibly get some extra money from him. In case (3)
1 can assure him that I obeyed my instructions, but
my jurors turned dog. Should he disbelieve me,
it really won’t matter. The evidence of such a
scoundrel would not be believed. I have simply to
meet him with a plain, emphatic denial, and inci-
dentally throw in a few of the unpleasant things I
know about him. Yes. I think I will stick to this
money.” And that is how, in about nine cases out
of 10, when the shady client thinks he is paying to
square the jury, no rigging is really done.
ROLLING ON THE STRAIGHTS.
The active steward balanced
With a pile of shining plates
When the ship did start a rolling,
A rolling in the straights ;
A shark appeared above the water
When a woman on the Deck
Wrung her hands with horror
There was going to be a wreck.
A stoutish man did growleth
About the tossing of the sea
Said the steward have a soda
And don’t throw up to me;
Heedless of sick passengers
He mingled with his mates
As the gallant ship was rolling,
Rolling on the straights.

DO YOU KNOW THE SYMPTOMS OF
KIDNEY DISEASE
Everyone lias heard of kidney disease —hut it is remarkable how
very few people know the symptoms of this most deadly 'complaint.
Do you know? Can you tell if you have kid-
ney trouble or not? Here are a few of the
symptoms. Aches and pains in the arms,
legs, muscles and joints, puffiness under the
eyes, cloudy urine, headaches, nasty taste in
the mouth first thing in the morning, swollen,
aching feet, general feeling of weakness and
irritability, and a drowsy, heavy feeling all
day long.
These symptoms are intended by Nature to
warn you that serious complaints such as
rheumatism, backache, gout, sciatica, lumbago,
gravel, stone and cystitis (inflammation of
the bladder) will develop if you do not act
promptly. They tell you that your kidneys
are weak and need strengthening immediately,
1 and' that' you are in deadly peril of awful
: kidney disease—the forerunner of that dreaded
Bright’s Disease, from which thousands of
I human beings die every year.
Now you know why delay is dangerous.
Get a box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder
= Pills at once. These wonderful little pills are
; prepared especially for kidney trouble, and
‘their success is due to the fact that they do not
■just pass through the bowels, but go straight
to the kidneys and bladder, removing the
deadly poison, strengthening the kidneys, and
enabling them to carry on their work as they
should do when in a normal, healthy condition.
Do not be put off with ordinary kidney or
backache pills, because you don’t know—you
have no proof that they have touched the
kidneys. You cannot afford to waste your
money, so make sure that the pills you buy do
go right to the weak spot—the kidneys them-
selves, and do what you want, them to —make you well. When you
take De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills you have this proof within
twenty-four hours —when you see that blue-colored urine.
That Killing
Pain in
the Back.”

a
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills can be obtained at any o'
the branches of Washington H. Soul, Pattinson & Co., Ltd., Sydney 1
Longmore’s The Melbourne Pharmacy, Bourkc
Street, Melbourne; and all leading chemists,
at 2/9 and 5/6 per large box. The 5/6 size
is two and a half times as large as the 2/9
size, and contains enough doses to last you
three weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you have
any difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills,
send the price of the package required to
either of the firms mentioned above, and the
goods will be sent by return, post free.
To cure Kidney Trouble of any kind
you must positively get rid of the
cause —the poisonous - Uric Acid. Re-
member, to do this, a real remedy must
pass through the kidneys and the
bladder, and not through the bowels as
most Kidney Pills do. When you see
the Urine change to a muddy, bluish
color—a feature which distinguishes De
Witt’s from all others—you know be-
yond all doubt that they have put their
healing touch on the right spot —the
kidneys and the bladder. A wonderful
pill —straight to the kidneys—that is
the reason why De Witt’s give such
amazingly quick relief every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Look for that blue color.

Dan Connelly, an ex-Mayor of Warwick,

no earthly chance in Warwick) would sup-
port Connelly, the Barnes family would

helping an out-and-out enemy rather than a
three-quarters friend.
If Denham keeps his grip on the pony
after the speed trials next month; it means a
mandate for quinquennial Parliaments. But
the signs are that a lot of Tory will be
thrown into the digester on polling day.
Denham himself, though he is expected to
get back, is up against the ugliest customer
he has yet had to face in Oxley.
Bananaland has now 17 itinerant teachers
tracking the youngsters to the remotest out-
back. Their districts are so large that
Johnny and Mary are, as a rule, interrupted
only about twice a year. Really, it’s mostly
a sort of examination the teacher holds ; he
leaves a supply of literature for the lonely
kids to drowse over, and calls in six months
later to discover how much of it they have
absorbed.
According to a deputation which waited
on Treasurer Barnes at Brisbane the other
day, the State Government’s promise to
Fisher in 1913, that it would introduce legis-
lation to keep Asiatic aliens out of the
sugar industry, has proved about as reliable
as a wire-netting apron would be to ward
off mosquitoes. It was because of the under-
standing that Queensland should keep its
sugar industry free of brown, yellow, black
and purple brethren that the other States
agreed to stand the £6 duty on sugar. With
John White _ as Minister for Agriculture,
however, various Bananaland- mills are slyly
making big holes iri the fence their State is
pledged to keep in repair. The Sugar Culti-
vation Act allows the Minister to issue’ 4
exemption certificates to colored aliens, and
John has been so industrious that one
mill has 60 colored employees. They out-
number the whites by three to one. Out of
30 whites and about 40 aliens at another
mill, 18 plain whites and no colored sorts got
the sack in a bunch ori a recent pay-day.
There is more than a suspicion that the
affection of some mills for colored labor
is partly due to Nippon’s trick of giving
the overseer a cut from his pay. in return
for the privilege of being permitted to keep
his job.
Brisbane owns a Control of Prices Board
which draws a salary and does a few less
important things. It began by tackling
meat. At the weekly stock sales prices as
usual jumped about, varying between 325.
and 755. per hundred. The Board met
weekly and made the retail prices chase up
and down likewise. This got everybody,
including itself, so mixed that it cancelled
its meat awards and looked round for some-
thing else to do. It tried to persuade, the
bakers to stop deliveries, and sell at the
bakehouse only and at a cheaper rate.. When
the Board’s missus told it to call for the
family loaf on the way home, it saw ants
in that proposal, too, and told the bakers
to fetch the bread and charge any old price.
Looking round for something easier to regu-
late, file Board found that bran and pollard
had risen 90 per cent., butter was up to
1425. per cwt. and other commodities were
thriving likewise. So it congratulated itself,
locked the office door, put the key under the
mat, arid left for a.spell at the seaside. The
key is- still under the mat.
AN OFFER .
PASSING KHAKI: “What's the trouble, kiddy?"
K IDDY: “Eve chucked me girl 'cause she wants me to be a blooming officer. Sail in now
if yer fancies her."
Governor Goold-Adams —he comes of
“quite a- good family,” too. has been in the
Army, and, being 58 next June, is old
enough to know better—introduced the
Sosh tiger in the most brazen manner
to a mixed audience of respectable
people .at the annual meeting of Bris-
bane Hospital the other day. He
could -not understand, he said, why it
was that when a majority of the hospital
committee consisted of Government nomi-
nees the . State did not take the full
responsibility. The public went on con-
tributing towards the upkeep of the insti-
tution, and was apparently satisfied ; but it
was the most peculiar thing in regard to a
hospital that he had ever heard of. And
then,. while the audience’s hair was still
standing up on end, his Ex. observed that
he had noticed that only three cases of sun-
stroke and five of malaria were reported
during the year—-a remarkable thing for a
sub-tropical country, and proving to him that
the State was a white man’s land. Some-
body ought to be written to or something
done about a Governor who goes on tearing
the Fatman’s standard to tatters like this.
Unrepentant.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They stood me up at the Judgment Seat,
The saints looked down at my stained feet.
They read the Roll
To my shaking Soul.
And told me, “Now you have reached the
Goal.
The times you slid
And the things you diet
Are now revealed with the sins you hid.
“You need not wince if the angels smile
To hear your story of human guile ;
For down below,
In the days ago,
They sinned themselves and they’B’ tell you
so; /
But, just in time, V
On the verge sublime,
Repentance came for the cure of Crime.
“The blots are black on your earthly page;
You erred like all of a puny age ;
You won’t deny
You were used to lie,
And shut your purse as the poor went by;
But, tell us this,
Did you find a hliss
In weeping tears o’er a life remiss?
“We’re not too stiff on the man who stole
And skinned the widow of house arid coal;
We’re not too hard
On the boozing bard.
Or the sensuous brute for the lives he
marred ;
We’ve pardon, too,
For the mu rd’ring crew
And the mad Malay with his opium brew,
“In case we find that they sobbed in time,
And grieved their plunge in the deeps o’
crime.
But you —you say
Never wept away
The deeds you did in the light o’ day.
Avaunt! Get rid
O’ the lout,” they bid ;
And I was aware of a lifting lid,
Of a gruesome smoke and a gleaming grid.
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 17, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
Rejoice with us! We guessed right!
Our new Ex. and his missus are both good
“sports.” Ilis Ex. was asked, in a purely
formal way, to fire the first shot at the
South Brisbane Rifle Club’s new miniature
range, which is to be opened on Monday
night. He beamingly consented, but sug-
gested that he and Lady Goold-Adams
should fire a sighter and seven counting
shots against any member of the club and
his wife or sister. The Mayor and Mayor-
ess of South Brisbane (Alderman and Mrs.
Davey) promptly took up the challenge. I
don’t think that Mrs. Davey has ever
handled anything more murderous than a
sewing needle, but she is no quitter when
the stranger within our gates sounds a
clarion defiance from the bloated battle-
ments or something like that.
Their Exes, are keeping themselves fit by
appearing at public meetings and helping
to saw off motions, amendments and other
flotsam. On one such occasion ways and
means were discussed to provide recreation
rooms for soldiers. The Adamses promptly
threw in for the use of “the boys” their best
pianola. Another patriot passed along a
billiard table; another a piano. The allure-
ments of the bars where the glasses are
sluiced in a pig-trough and dried with what
looks like an old floor-cloth (I got these
details from a duke’s wayward son) won’t
be in it with those of Tommy Bananaland’s
recreation rooms. The difficulty is to obtain
suitable premises, but that will be overcome.
A. Id. Whittingham, the president of the
movement, got the dubious eye from the
women people when he moved that the
rooms shall be open to those who have
departed from the chalk-line as well as
those who have not. That is, that there
should be accommodation for the warrior
who has had perhaps too much liquor so
that he won’t be tempted to get more. I
voted for that, Thargomindah—l remem-
bered R. Kipling’s remarks as I firmly
shouted “Aye” :
There comes a night when the best get tight,
And women don’t understand.
Members of the Johnsonian Club met the
Governor the other day on their premises
amid a round of hand-shake and soda.
Mrs. Spencer Browne, who shortly will
depart this State, was the guest of honor
at an afternoon tea on Tuesday afternoon,
under the hostessing of Miss May Fitz-
gerald. On Thursday afternoon the
departing lady was At Home, and her
friends came from miles around to speak
the necessary “Safe Returns” to her and her
equally popular husband.
Mrs. Symes and Miss Mactaggart are
working like Trojans (Trojans were a sort
of ichthyosaurus, I think) for a concert and
dramatic entertainment which they are
arranging to hold on May 4 for that money-
glutton these days, the Red Cross. Our
Excellencies have promised to he there, and
the Mayor and Mayoress and the Comman-
dant and Mrs. Lee.
Several more weddings can no longer be
concealed. On Wednesday Hilda Love and
Ewen Spence were committed for life at
St. John’s Cathedral, some 150 of the
lady’s friends being present on the solemn
occasion. The bride was a dainty vision
in satin and lace, and the bridesmaids, Jean
Hardie and Hilda Spowers, were effectively
frocked in pale blue and lavender crepe de
chine, with flounces of shadow lace. They
wore blue velvet hats, with . water-lilies for
trimming, and carried bouquets of the same
flower. Lance Morrisset was best man, and
Ralph Gore was groomsman.
The same fell day saw a similar risk
taken by Eileen Hooper, eldest daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. W. J. Hooper, and Kenneth
Cameron, one of the Beauchamp Cameron
clan. Isa Hooper was bridesmaid, and a
Cameron saw his brother through the pro-
ceedings. The perpetrators were last seen
going in the direction of Sydney.
An engagement that has caused a flutter
in debutante circles is that of Thelma
Taylor, the brown-eyed daughter of the
Taylors, of Russell Park station. Surat, to
Alleyn Edols, eldest son of the Burrawang
Edols family (N.S.W.).
Mrs. Halford lent her home at Clayfield
to an energetic committee, which on
Wednesday afternoon draped it in flags and
sold tickets for a. bridge and tennis after-
noon. They refrained from offering prizes,
so every cent raked in was a cent gained
for the Clayfield branch of the Red Cross.
Premier Denham opened the new rooms
oi the Young Women’s branch of the
Q.W.E.L. on Tuesday night, and handed
over the key, swathed in blue ribbon, to
Mrs. Hulsen, the first president of the
xircT' was further blessed by Mrs.
W. S._ Anderson unveiling her portrait for
the edification of all good Liberal ladies and
the ornamentation of the new premises.
Whether it is cautious of the Liberal party
encourage an extra branch of the
Q.W.E.L. tor start business is another
matter. It is entirely due to the muddling
or the parent body of political females that
the Merthyr electorate finds itself in its
present queer position. Two Liberal candi-
dates are standing, and one, Lackey,; is
appealing to the law to tie his Liberal
brother’s hands and gag and leg-rope him.
Ihe other candidate is Bayley, a capable and
energetic young man who has been more
than hindered by his alleged helpers.
The busy Mrs. Forrest, Queensland’s most
prolific verse-builder, has been having a long
bout with the fiend of ill-health, and for
most of this year has been in the Victoria
fnvate Hospital in South Brisbane. Now
a ble to sit up and take notice. In
fact, the other day she made a rhyme; and
then she knew for certain she was getting
to be herself again.
Mrs. Milman, widow of the late Govern-
ment Resident at Thursday Island, and her
daughter, are staying in Berkshire while
the lights o’ London are shrouded. The
Milman family .was so popular in the tropic
isle that a wail of regret from its piebald
community followed the departure of the
feminine part of the menage after the
death of Papa Milman.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
His new Excellency lias lost no time in
letting Queensland know that he has ideas
about agriculture and stock. He has made
the subject a hobby in the English-country-
squire sort of way, and at -Toowoomba
Show fired off one of his notions about the
sensible encouragement of breeding to suit
the surroundings. He would no longer, he
said, . allow stock to be judged by
“foreigners” whose chief qualification was
often the distance from which they were
brought. He would educate a class of
judges with knowledge of what the country
could and ought to produce for its parti-
cular purposes, and so set up a standard
which farmers could lay hold of as some-
thing tangible. National secretary Bain has
long been hammering away at this idea
with his Brisbane Council, and this Too-
woomba speech Caused Bain and the Coun-
cil to give each other the eye of' suspicion.
But the Gov. had really hit the idea off
his own bat, and now that it has had such
exalted commendation something may come
of it.


The Lahmann Health Home
MIRAMAR NORTH : WELLINGTON : NEW ZEALAND
€| The Lahmann Health Home s conducted on the lines of the original Lahmann
Institution in Europe, which accommodates some 35,000 patients per annum, and
where the Nature-healing treatment originated by Dr. Heinrich Lahmann has met
with such remarkable success. The Miramar Home is the only establishment of
its kind in Australasia, or, indeed, in the British Empire.
€]J The splendid successes achieved by the application of Dr. Lahmann’s methods
at the Miramar Home indicate that this system offers relief to many sufferers
from Chronic Diseases. The Institution is owned and conducted by a Medical
Director who is a qualified English Doctor.
The Medical Director is assisted by an M.D. of Zurich University, who has made
a special study of Lahmann methods under Dr. Lahmann himself, as well as of
Electricity, Hydropathy, Massage and Physical Culture in Sweden and Finland.
The Lahmann Health Home is an institution for the scientific treatment of Chronic
Diseases by the Lahmann “Nature-healing” methods.
The Lahmann System
€| The need for such a home as the Lahmann lies in the
many diseases which arise chiefly from the artificial conditions
of modern life, and which do not usually yield to a course
of medicine or an operation. Such cases call for a complete
change of living conditions; for the scientific application of
the healing forces of Nature. The means used are air, water,
sunshine, heat, cold, physical exercises, massage (both manual
and mechanical), electricity, electric light, electric current,
and the high-frequency current, besides carefully supervised
excercise and regulated diet. Consistent treatment upon
these lines has proved impossible in a patient’s own home,
hence the necessity for an establishment where every appli-
ance necessary is available under one roof, whilst the patient
is continuously under the doctor’s observation.
Comfort, Equipment, Climate
€][ Everything that can add to the comfort of the patients
and the efficiency of the treatment is included in the equip-
ment of the Home. Treatment-rooms for electric and hydro
treatment are fitted with the most up-to-date apparatus
available. *1 The social life of the Home receives careful
attention; the grounds include Tennis and Croquet Lawns,
and in the house is a Billiard Room with a good table.
Golf and Fishing are also available.
€J The climate of this part of New Zealand is particularly
bracing, and as the Home is situated amid the pleasant sur-
roundings of hill and harbour and sea, “the call of the out-
doors” finds a ready response from many guests, with
corresponding benefit to heatlh.
tj The Home is not a
Mental Hospital; and for
obvious reasons no infec-
tious cases (including
phthisis) can be received.
The diseases suitable for
treatment in the Home in-
clude most cases of chronic
suffering and ill-health, and
all the long list of nerve
troubles, from Epilepsy and
Chorea down to Insomnia.
Rheumatism, Uric Acid,
Indigestion and Dyspepsia
troubles, including Consti-
pation, have yielded great
successes to the Lahmann
Nature Treatment.
CJ Pleasantly situated at the head of the Miramar Valley,
just at the terminus of the tram-line, the Home stands with
its back to the hills, whilst from the front balcony one looks
over the suburb and golf-links of Miramar out to the sea
beyond the sand dunes. The house is thoroughly equipped
with all the necessities for massage, electric, balneological
and orthopoedic treatment. Bedrooms are heatable either
by open fires or electric radiators.
CJ Recently the Lahmann Home has taken over the entire
Electrical Establishment in Wellington of Mr. Axel Holtz.
Here is obtainable treatment by Electric bath, full or partial;
the Four-cell bath; and the High-frequency Current. All
these are available under qualified medical direction,
without extra charge to patients residing in the Home.
€J The weaknesses of con-
valescence following severe
illness or operation yield
speedily to the Lahmann
methods. Urinary Troubles,
Bright’s Disease and Dia-
betes; Constitutional Blood-
poisoning, Obesity, Chronic
Bronchitis and Asthma; in
the relief of all these the
Home has many successes
to its credit.
q Many cases of Chronic
Female Complaints, difficult
and abnormal Pregnancies
have also been treated by
the Lahmann methods with
remarkable success.
The Management invites enquiries from all whose sufferings are of the nature
indicated, and will be happy to advise or to correspond with the patient's medical
adviser as to whether any case is likely to be susceptible to the Lahmann Treat-
ment. The Lahmann Health Home Illustrated Prospectus will be posted gratis
on request. It contains full information as to terms (these are quite moderate).
address add enquiries to business manager.

THE BOOKMAKERS’ TRINITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I am disgusted beyond expression at the idea that
this great movement should be brought down to the
level of being told that the crowning end and flower
of it is to introduce the totalisator.— N.S.W. Premier
Holman, at the P.L.L. Conference.
“I quite agree with Holman,” said McMoses. (“I
agree
With Labor or with anything that holds the fort
for me !)
It fairly stabs my heart, it does, to see the Labor
Cause
Besmirched by men who only want the multitude’s
applause;
By men who size and sum me up, and my possessions
note—
Apostates of the Labor Faith, the tyrants of the
tote!
“A high and holy thing it is, this proletarian creed'
(As anything at all would be that helped me in my
need!).
Was ever cause so wonderful, so gracious, so sublime,
And so' cutely calculated to assist me all the time ?
A noble cause, a lofty cause, and we must keep it
clean
By fighting for the Right and Me—in place of the
machine!
‘‘ldeals are splendid things to have; and were they
lightly tost
Away to please the multitude—well, Labor would be
Lost!
And wouldn’t that be terrible? I shudder at the
thought
Of seeing all my Christian dreams and strivings
come to nought!
It must not be, it cannot be; we’ll let no demons
gloat
Above my crucified remains beside the sinful tote!
“Ask him, my friend the parson, who has fought the
holy fight
Along with me and Holman—just you ask him if
I’m right.
We have fought the fight together, hand in hand,
against the Shame,
(What matter if the Devil winked the day the
parson came!)
Let those who will their tauntings hurl, it’s plain
I’m sanctified—•
For Labor's and the Church’s saints are fighting by
my side.
“Oh! pass the book of daily pray’r—endorsement
that is God’s—
What time I ‘deaden’ punters’ choice and cramp
the winner’s odds;
And shriek the Labor sentiments, the sort that
Holman plans
For me to fleece the simpletons who back the ‘also
rans.’
Three cheers for him who rescues souls; three cheers
for Holman’s vote—•
For both have worked for God and Me against the
sinful tote!”

THE
MAZDA LAMP
has been appropriately termed
“THE SUN’S
ONLY RIVAL ”
The justification for such a comparison
lies in the fact that the MAZDA LIGHT is
practically akin to Sunlight in its illumi=
nating qualities and effects.

If Your Neighbor Has
Electric Light
and you have not, just step into his house some evening
and ask him if he would now tolerate any other kind of
lighting in his home. You’ll feel the same way about it
after you have once tried electric lighting.
Find out from us how easily your
house can be wired. See the new Edi-
son Mazda Lamps that give twice as
much light as ordinary electric lamps
that use the same current. New Edison
Mazda Lamps are strong enough for all
ordinary usage, being many times stronger
than the old tungsten lamps.

HAS MONEY TO LEND
Novel Method for
Waving the Hair.
TOILET TALKS.
MANY a charming face is spoiled by
straight, lank, and excessively greasy
hair. Naturally curly hair gives a most
delightful effect even to a plain face, a fact
which has unfortunately; been known for
many years. This knowledge alone has re-
sulted in the ruination of thousands of heads
of beautiful hair by slow torture from that
terrible instrument, the curling iron. Im-
agine, if you can, how the. living hair squirms
and twists under such treatment. Yet this
is the very result you aim at. Well, I have
no doubt that each one individually is of the
opinion that the results justify
the meas, but let me tell you
that the reckoning will have to
be paid, and in a manner which
will be far from pleasant. The
twists and curls created- by the
hot iron are the hairs’ dying con-
tortions, and it is only a question
of time when you will have no
hair left to torture. If it is
absolutely necessary to have
wavy hair, then there is a far
more simple and harmless pro-
cess which any woman may
adopt without fear as to the
results. Get from your chemist
two ounces of silmerine, and
pour about two tablespoonfuls into a saucer.
With a clean toothbrush apply this to the
hair upon retiring. You will be quite
amazed at the result, and one application
will last for many days'. Damp weather
need have no terrors for you if you take
these simple precautions, and straight, wispy
tails will be converted into tight little curls,
giving a charming and pfettv effect, even to
i plain face.
Note. —Silmerine has not been used to any
extent for this purpose, but most chemists
keep a small supply in stock.
NOW about shampoos. Is it reasonable
to expect that one particular make will
suit everybody? Certainly not. Some
â
folks have dry and brittle hair, others have
tresses which are excessively greasy. Each
requires a different grade of shampoo, if one
is to obtain the best results. The writer’s
notice was recently brought to a substance
called stallax, which can be obtained from
most chemists. It consists of small gran-
ules. which, when mixed with a cup of hot
water, make the most charming mixture
imaginable for shampooing the hair. Ac-
cording to the quantity used, so the strength
is graduated to suit all conditions. There
is one drawback, however, and that is stallax
can only be obtained in ilb. tins,
which cost about half-a-crown,
but as this quantity is sufficient
to make 25 to 30 shampoos, it
is really very economical in the
end. It leaves the hair a little
too wavy and fluffy for some
tastes, but this can always'bhe
avoided by rubbing a little olive
oil on the scalp previous to its
application.
A FEW remarks on face
creams may not be out o F
place, and at the risk of being
put down as a little old-fash-
ioned, my advice on this subject
is to leave well alone. Do not
dog the pores with greasy concoctions
which not only prevent the skin from
performing its proper functions, but
usually result in encouraging a growth
or hair on the face, and you know
very well what that means —disfigure-
ment for the rest of your natural days.
If it is necessary to use an emollient at
all, get some mercolised wax from your
chemist and apply in the usual way.
This remarkable substance seems to absorb
the worn and weatherbeaten outer cuticle,
and in a few days’ time the new, healthy
skin underneath peeps forth in all its
brilliance, and is, of course, quite free from
imperfection or blemish. P

He has a great big dial
you can easily read in the

that ring just when you

The Inky Way.
“Gnat Spry”: Redmond, of the Sydney
Sun, who was killed in the Manly motor
smash, was a sterling news-editor, primarily
because of his genius for organisation. It
was a treat to watch him at work when
any big job was on. The bigger the strain
the steadier he was. Remembering what
he could do as a descriptive writer —his
political work in Melbourne and his Argus
story of the Burns-Jolmson fight in Sydney,
for instance —I always regretted that lie
was a mere news-editor, whose business it
was to see that other men wrote, while he
did no writing himself; but these regrets
vanished when I saw him on busy days, and
perceived the facility with which he
arranged the staff to give the best that was
in them. He was a good pressman, manly
and sincere, with a frank, pleasant style,
and when he went West journalism in
Australia was a man short.

author hurried to despatch a message that
his “copy” had been misunderstood, or muti-
lated, or something—that he had made it
clear in his story that he was referring not
to the men in general, hut to a section of
wasters who had since been weeded out.
But Bean, like many another good press-
man, found just how difficult it was to catch
up with and slay the thing that raised the
trouble. In addition to the difficulty he
found it very unpleasant. It was rough on
the correspondent, because he is a great
admirer of Billjim Australia, and a consci-
entious trier to get at the right and wrong
of things he expands upon.

Another inky wayfarer moves off to the
interminable Front from Maoriland. That
is the editor of Kai Tiaki (The Guard-
ian), the journal of the M.L. nursing pro-
fession. When she isn’t editing Miss H.
Maclean is Assistant-Inspector of Hospi-
tals. She is now commandant of the con-
tingent of M.L. nurses enlisted for the
scarified fields of France.

“W.T.B.’s” few remarks from London :
In The Bulletin (7/1/T5) a pardon, name of
Matthews, defines a wowser. Now this very subject
was under discussion at the Press Club here a few
nights ago. You see, London has a real, genuire,
well-equipped Press Club at last. Originally we
had a place in Wine Office Court, which, owing to
its general appearance, was known as “The Pot-
House.” Just as the lease was flickering out we had
a nice little fire, but some idiot put it out. How-
ever, we had another a few days later —a real one —-
and then we had to shift. Our r.ew club is at St.
Bride’s House, Fleet-street; and Kennedy Jones, who
was responsible for re-organising Waring and Oil-
lows, Ltd., and who runs a few racehorses and other
necessary luxuries, attended to the furnishing. We
haven’t paid the bill yet, because it isn’t safe to
give people too many shocks at once. I think if
Willie Holman would come along and raise a 41
per cent, debenture to cover the cost he would be
elected an honorary member for life, with his por-
trait in oils hung in the club’s art gallery amongist
the caricatures, by Arthur Moreland, of the mem-
bers who have in the past done something they
ought to be ashamed of. What we were trying to
get at the other night, as I was saying, was a true
definition of “wowser,” the word not being in general
use in Loan-land —owing, of course, to the war.
The accepted was: A wowser is an individual who,
if by any means he could be suddenly changed from
mortal form into one of those watches which certain
ultra-smart girls wear on their ankles, would con-
tinue to keep his hands in front of his face.

“Copy Boy” : Defence Minister Pearce has
taken the only course open to a good union-
ist by issuing instructions that parsons with
the expeditionary forces are not to increase
their bloated salaries by sending “copy” to
the press. More than one daily that did
not rush Official Correspondent Bean’s work
(all of which can be obtained at a very
moderate price—somewhere about £6O a
year) has shown a willingness to accept “ex-
clusive” drivel at dog-poor rates from gentle-
men who button their collars at the back;
and the fact that they have been scotched
calls for a round of drinks.
* * * *
Malcolm Ross, appointed by the Massey
Government to the futile post of Maoriland’s
official “war correspondent,” is a more-or-less
free-lance journalist who has done a lot of
work from Wellington, particularly for
South Island Tory newspapers. For many
years he was M.L. correspondent of London-
Times, and more than once fell foul of
Richard Seddon in that connection, “King
Dick” accusing him of bias. He recently
published an extensive work on mountain-
eering in M.L. The runner-up for the job
was E. V. Hall, of Wellington Post, who
not long back showed Sydney Telegraph
some of his fine ability, but could not be
induced to remain.

“T. 0.1.”: Apropos paper-making in Aus-
tralia, which is again suggested, I have a
copy of the “Annual Report of Public
Schools in N. S. Wales, 1867,” inscribed:
“This book is printed on paper made in
the Colony. Henry Parkes.” The paper
is now dark, but of fairly good quality.
MONOMANIA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have no passion fierce for gold;
I’m prodigal with drink, 1 fear;
Nor land nor houses do I hold ;
But I’ve a miser’s passion here
Hid in my heart nought can divert.
With one thing I am mean }s dirt.
I hoard it up in little piles ;
I steal it, too, whene’er I can ;
I wheedle it with subtle wiles
From Inky Jim, the printer’s man,
And in my loom ’gainst future need
I’m storing it with shameless greed.
Bold burglars may invade at night.
Moths may corrupt—l do not care.
But Hell afflict with lasting blight
The wretch who wanders to my lair
And steals, or wastes with whim or caper,
My own, my cherished copy paper!

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Another Triumph for
LAXO-TONIC Pills
Mrs. M. ADAMS.
(From a Photo.)
“Allow me herewith to thank
you for the quick ancl per-
manent cure I have received
by using your Laxo-Tonic
Pills for acute constipation
that had been giving me seri-
ous trouble for some time,”
writes Mrs. M. Adams, 66
Bowmont Street, South Inver-
cargill, N.Z. “I had used
numerous remedies before I
tried the above Pills, but they
were of absolutely no use
whatever in the way of giving
relief, much less effecting a
cure. Headaches and Bilious
attacks, vomiting after meals,
sleeplessness and great de-
pression of spirits were some
of the numerous maladies I
suffered, but after using your
Laxo-Tonic Pills for a very
short time all those symp-
toms have entirely disap-
peared. I am altogether a
different person in feeling and
appearance, and I can now
enjoy a good meal of any
description without any fear
of the after agonies, and I
shall for ever feel grateful
and thankful for the great
relief and permanent cure I
have received by using your
Laxo-Tonic Pills.”
ALL LADIES NEED LAXO-TONIC PILLS.
Laxo-Tonic Pills can be taken at all times, and under all conditions, by both
young and old alike, without the least risk and without any danger of unpleasant
aftereffects. Laxo-Tonic Pills assist the process of nature, give relish to the
food and prevent exhaustion, nausea, sick headaches, and other ailments to which
women are so accustomed. With the girl, the young woman, the mother, the
middle-aged woman, and the woman of advanced years, Laxo-Tonic Pills will prove
to be a most reliable friend.
Thousands of people take one every night at bedtime, to prevent dis-
orders of the Inver, Constipation, Bad Breath, Pimples and Headache.
Try them for a week—take one 0:1 retiring nightly. Small size, Is.; Large

The Lily and the Landlady.
A TRAGIC ROMANCE OF OYSTERS,
AFFINITY AND TWELVE POUNDS
FOUR AND SIX.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AN angry person steep with hair
Chafed his large boots upon my
mat;
My landlady, in stark despair,
Threw Chidley’s “Answer” at the cat ;
In various corners of the town
Men sought my bright career to fix.
For I was lord of half a crown,
And owing twelve pounds four-and-six.
The solid facts of life were stern :
My means of livelihood were thin ;
Cold cash is ever hard to earn
By those who neither toil nor spin,
And seeing that all things looked blue
I wandered far and far away,
Observing how the lilies grew,
And how the sunlight warmed the day.
At certain seasons it is good
To note how little ants may strive
Collecting their supplies of food
To keep their busy jaws alive ;
But, on the whole, I much prefer
To sit with lilies in the sun,
The while that great Artificer
Makes bright the robes His rays have
spun.
One mile beyond where Mosman ends
The Middle Harbor softly winds
By little bays and coves, and bends
Where oysters rest with quiet minds,
Knowing that their envenomed shells,
Replete with germs of typhoid drear,
No midnight Dago plucks and sells
Unless the coast is very clear.
They sit and slumber in the wet
Because the odds are on their side,
Or, waking without murmur, set
Their valves to work to eat the tide.
I envied those untroubled lives
Which knew not gladness nor despair,
Nor any trick that Fate contrives
To catch the heedless unaware.
Lilies and oysters have their place,
Teaching the simple life to men ;
But what a marvel of a face
The clear blue summer showed me then!
Her lunch was spread upon a stone,
She ate the remnants of a peach,
A happy damsel all alone
On three brown yards of shelly beach.
I introduced myself with speed.
In case the vision should depart
And leave me in my utter need
With large commotion of the heart.
She smiled. The world was very good.
She gave me welcome, kind and shy.
All things were suited to my mood.
And golden winged the hours went by.
At twelve o’clock I saw her first.
I offered her my love at three.
At just a quarter-past I nurst
tier numerous charms upon my knee.
She was to marry me next day.
The thing was easy to arrange.
Though I had many pounds to pay
And only two and six in change.
At five o'clock we said farewell.
At six I reached my cheerless room ;
Around my entering steps there fell
A silence as of coming doom.
Men hold landladies have their use.
T did not feel the need of mine.
I knew my homing would produce
A flood of rhetoric fair and fine.
I knew that T should hear again
Remarks about the price of beef,
And that the everlasting strain
Of household bills was past belief.
I knew (hose pleading tones and grave
With which I should be asked to find
The necessary pash to save
That simple homestead poor but kind.
She came amid the scented dusk
That crept about the creaking stair;
Sweets as of cabbage, lamb and musk
Lay heavy on the moveless air.
She spoke, and as she spoke she wept.
My soul was filled with vague alarms,
Remorse through all my being crept,
I drew her weeping to my arms.
The gas leaned up upon the stair.
The housemaid uttered one shrill cry
To see her mistress, stout and fair.
Dropping slow tears upon my tie.
Then our engagement was declared —
It seemed the onlv thing to do.
And I whom fate till then had spared
Was pleasantly betrothed to two.
I turned the matter in my mind
And viewed this new entanglement.
I wondered whether I shoidd find
The marriage status worse than rent.
Th“ sweet girl sitting far from town
Was bright as drinks that barmaids mix,
But I was lord of half a crown
And owing twelve pounds four and six.
LiJios and oysters have their nlaee.
They whisper of the simple life;
A maiden with a perfect face
May prove a most expensive wife.
Dark is the visage of the dun.
But fortune keeps me still afloat
In that establishment we run
Five minutes from the Mosman boat.
N.S.W.
PAT O’MAOI.
Shortening Sail.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALL day long the wind has been
steadily increasing, whilst the glass
has been just as steadily falling,
until at sunset it is standing at 28.89 inches.
This perhaps does not convey very much
to the average landsman, but when making
down for the Horn, in 56deg. South lati-
tude. with winter coming on, it is apt to
make the seaman ponder over a misspent
life. The sun, after showing at fitful inter-
vals throughout the day, has gone down
behind a bank of ragged copper-colored
clouds; wild, wicked looking clouds, with
great rents and gashes torn in them, as
though some gigantic hand is trying to rip
them to pieces. Overhead, the lower strata
of clouds are travelling before the storm
with ever increasing violence, whilst the
wind, shrieking through the rigging, takes
on a newer and shriller note as it grows
stronger.
The Old Man, who has the reputation of
being a “beggar to carry on,” is on the poop,
watching keenly all there is to be seen
before darkness falls. He does not want to
shorten down if he can help it, as this is
a fine, fair wind, and we are throwing four-
teen good miles behind us every hour. At
the same time he quite recognises the risk
he is taking, in view of the very low glass,
lie knows that by the morning it will be
utterly out of the question to heave-to, as
with the sea that will be running then no
ship could live when once in the trough of
it. And to continue running will be just
about as dangerous, as there is always the
danger of “broaching to” ( i.e ., coming up
broadside on to the sea. the most dangerous
position there is in heavy weather), and
that would mean the end of all things. We
still have our upper topsails set, although
they should have been in. or, at any rate,
reefed, long ago. The skipper takes a final
look round, and decides to keep going.
Night is coming on. The sun. now almost
on the horizon, peers out sullenly for a
moment through a rent in the storm-driven
clouds, and then is seen no more. the old
shell-backs, men who have been rounding
Cape Horn (or, as they would term it, Cape
Stiff) for thirty years or more, shake their
heads solemnly as the sun disappears. One
of them, voicing the thoughts of the rest,
remarks in a croaking voice: “Wonder
where we’ll be when that there sun turns-to
’n’ gets up agin.”
As darkness sets in the scene grows yet
wilder. Monstrous seas rear their foam-
crested heads behind us as though striving
to overwhelm us as they break. But always,
just in the nick of time, when it seems as if
another second will see us engulfed, we rise
to it, and. as though disappointed at not
crushing us, the wave roars away along the
ship’s side, towering high above the fore-
yard as it spends itself ahead of us. Very
careful steering is wanted just now, for a
moment’s inattention on the part of the
helmsman would probably mean the loss of
the ship.
“Ting-ting. . . .Ting-ting. . . .Ting-ting. . . .
Ting-ting!” Eight bells strikes, and the
men struggle aft to muster on the poop,
fighting their way through the swirling mass
of water that was once the main deck. The
Second Mate calls over the names of the
watch coming on deck: “Hansen, Schultz,
Williams, Smith, Farrell, Lindstrum, Drew.
McLean, Harris, Dobson.” He glances to-
wards the Mate (he is always the Mate on
a sailing-ship—only on steamboats does he
assume the more highly gilded title of Chief
Officer). “All here, sir.” he says.
The Mate stumps over to where the men
are herded together on the lee side of the
poop, and gazes fiercely at them. “Relieve
the wheel ’n’ lookout.” be roars. “See you
keep yourselves handy, ’n’ don’t be stowing
yourselves away in the Col-damned fo’c’s’le.
Watch below, be ready for a call, ’n’ don’t
be all the night turning out if you’re wanted,
unless you want my boot around you.”
The wateli below, snatching a chance
when tlie main deck is for a moment clear
ol water, dashes along to the fo’c’s’le, to turn
in with luck, till midnight, whilst a figure
swathed from head to foot in yellow oil-
skins goes over to relieve the wheel. Tie
steps up behind the man now steering, and
reaching over his shoulder takes the spokes
from him. for when running before a high
sen like this, the wheel must not be out of
the helmsman’s bands for a second.
“East a ’arf North, ’n’ mind yer weather
’cllum.”
“East a ’arf North it is.” and the new
man settles himself (Town to two hours of
ceaseless activity. ’A high canvas screen
runs round the poop rail, so that the helms-
man cannot look back and see the walls of
water rushing down towards -the ship. I
know of no sight more terrifying than this,
and when steering before a heavy sea there
is often a tendency on the part of the man
at the wheel to look back when lie hears a
big comber roaring along behind him. It is
beyond all doubt that many a good ship has
been lost through this. The helmsman has
looked round, lost his nerve, let go the wheel
in a panic, the ship lias broached to. and —
a small paragraph in an obscure part of the
daily papers, and “Missing” posted against
her name at Lloyd’s.
The Mate, who has the watch on deck
till midnight, takes up his position so that
he can keep an eye on the steering.
“Find her heavy?” he asks.
“She is a bit, sir,” answers the man.
“Carries a lot o’ weather ’ellum.”
The Mate blows his whistle and the
apprentice doing “binnacle duty” on the
lee side of the poop comes in answer.
“Boy to the lee wheel.” orders the Mate.
No words are ever wasted on a sailing ship;
and in a few moments one of the boys takes
his place on the lee grating, to give the
steersman a hand. Invaluable training this
for that boy if he keeps his eyes open.
The rest of the watch on deck, having
been told to keep handy, are standing by
under the break of the poop. Their oilskin
trousers are marled down with rope yarns
to keep the water out of their boots. Their
short oilskin coats are also tied round with
ropeyarns at the waist and wrists. These
ai - e known as “soul and body lashings,” and
to a certain extent they keep one dry, but
God help the man who goes overboard with
them on.
On a night like this, however, that would
be an advantage, rather than otherwise, as
if anyone went over the side to-night there
would be no earthly chance of assisting him.
No skipper would risk the almost certain
loss of a number of his men, and possibly
all hands, in order to rescue one man ; and
in any case, even were it practicable to
launch a boat, it would certainly not live
for five minutes. Therefore, if anyone does
go over the side, no attempt will be made
to rescue him. and the sooner his “soul and
body lashings” pull him down, the sooner
his sufferings will be over. Also it will
prevent the albatrosses from getting him
while he is yet alive.

Wound Festered and Inflamed, and Throbbing

Mr
. HILL . whose arm was
healed by Zam-Buk.
MAN’S GRATITUDE TO ZANI-BUK
A BADLY poisoned arm, which crip-
pled him for seven months, was
the after results of Mr. H. Hill,
of 16 Windmill Street, New Farm, Bris-
bane, trying to get through a barbed-
wire fence. Read Mr. Hill’s story of
how, when the doctor’s treatment failed,
Zam-Buk performed a splendid healing
feat. “I was getting through a barbed-
wire fence when I badly ripped open my
forearm,” he said. “The wound fes-
tered and gradually became worse. In
the opening, the edges of which yawned
apart, matter filled in and my arm in-
flamed in a terrible manner. The pain
was awful, for the wound would throb
and throb, making it nigh unbearable.
At night I could not sleep, and although
I used many remedies, as well as an
ointment which a doctor prescribed, I
did not get any relief.
“After I had suffered for over seven
months a friend persuaded me to com-
mence using Zam-Buk, as she herself
had great faith in it. I purchased a
supply, and shortly after the first appli-
cation, I obtained much ease. The inflam-
mation and throbbing pains were not so
bad, and a corresponding benefit was
noticed after each application. Inflam-
mation was drawn out and the wound
cleansed of all impurities. I persevered
with Zam-Buk until the injury had
completely knitted together and healed
up in a splendid manner.
“We always keep Zam-Buk by us.”

Anaemia
Frequently Unrecognised
The Importance of its Detection
The Symptoms of Anaemia (Poorness
of Blood) are Difficulty of Breathing, Lack of
Energy, Depression, Pallor, and Exhaustion after
Slight Exertion. Many people fail to recognise
these symptoms of Anaemia— the disease creeps
on, obtains a firm grip of the system and eventually
becomes chronic. If the symptoms are recognised
at the beginning it is a very simple matter to enrich
the blood and so effectually check the disease.
Iron Jelloids
enrich the blood—renew vitality
After taking IRON ‘JELLOIDS,’ the blood becomes
enriched and strengthened, the distressing symptoms of
Anaemia quickly disappear, giving place to a state of
vigorous health and buoyant spirits.
DR. ANDREW WILSON wrote "It can be definitely stated
“ that Iron ‘ Jelloids ’ constitute the most effective and desirable
“ treatment for Anaemia or Poorness of Blood.”
A fortnight’s trial ( Price 1/6 ) will convince yon.

By now it is blowing with almost hurri-
cane force, and even above the roar of the
wind the loud cracking of the tops 1 sheets
and halyards can be plainly heard. The
backstays are as taut as harpstrings, and
the tall steel masts are springing forward
like whips under the strain of the upper-
topsails. Only the fact that those same
tops’ls are made of new storm canvas has
prevented them from being blown out of the
bolt-ropes long ago. The Mate gazes
anxiously at the Old Man, who is still on
the poop. He knows that those topsails
ought to have been in before dark, but that
strange, cast-iron thing, sailing ship eti-
quette, forbids him suggesting such a thing
to the skipper. The skipper himself knows
they should be in, but he doesn’t want to
lose a ha’porth of this fair wind if he can
help it. The ship is now smoking along at
close on fifteen knots. Very little can be
seen of her, as her main deck, from the
break of the poop to the fo’c’s’le head, is full
of water from rail to rail. Huge seas loom
suddenly out of the darkness, and fall on
board with a thunderous crash, breaking
into a mass of white foam, against which,
for a moment, the masts, rigging, and other
parts of the ship show out jet black. It is
taking one’s life in one’s hands to go into
that inferno of water for one minute, yet if
we have to shorten down, all hands will be
working there half the night.
At six bells the skipper goes down to
have another look at the glass, and finds
that it has fallen another tenth. He comes
hurriedly on deck again, and remarks to
the Mate: “Think we’d better get them
there upper torps’ls off her, Mister. Call
all ’ands to shorten down.”
In less than the hundredth part of a
second the Mate is leaning over the break
of the poop, bawling at the top of his voice,
‘‘A ll—han(ls—sliorten — sail."
* ¥r * *
Inside the forecastle all is calm and
peaceful. At least, from a sailor’s point of
view it is. A mere shore person might
notice, and be annoyed by, the incessant
creaking and groaning of the ship as she
rolls, the splashing to and fro of a foot or
so of water that has found its way in
through the door, the rattling of forks,
knives, pannikins, hook-pots, tin plates, etc.,
in the lockers, the banging of something that
has fetched adrift in the fore-peak imme-
diately underneath, and the hundred and
one other noises. But the inmates notice
none of these things. They are sleeping
quite peacefully, with their blankets pulled
well over their faces. Some of them still
have chews of tobacco in their mouths, and
all of them have their pipes lying handy, to
be lit the moment they awake.
Hanging from the deck beams are two
slush lamps, which throw a very dim light
on the scene. The atmosphere is solid.
There are nine men sleeping here, and each
one has had a smoke before going to sleep.
The slush lamps are giving off the heavy
smoke and smell peculiar to colza oil, and to
this is added the reek of wet clothes, oil-
skins, tallow-smeared leather sea boots,
oakum, rope, oil, and other odors too numer-
ous to mention and too complicated to
analyse. Of ventilation there is none. There
is no skylight, and, owing to the weather,
no ports can be opened. The door has been
closed all day for the same reason, only
being opened for a few seconds when any-
one is entering or leaving.
Breaking in on this comes a booted
and oilskinned seaman, yelling raucously,
“Nah, then, show a leg, show a
leg, show a leg. All hands shorten sail.
Come on, what abaht it? Rise and shine,
rise and shine. Nah then, show a leg, show
a leg.” He lights, and takes a hasty draw at,
a very foul pipe, looks round finally to see
that everyone is awake, cautiously opens the
door, so as not to admit a sea, and dashes out
on deck again. Inside, the watch below,
cursing and grumbling in true sailor fashion
(for no sailor would find life bearable if he
could not grumble), are already nearly
dressed. In the fo’c’s’le of a wind-jammer they
don’t trouble about wearing silk pyjamas.
When the sailor turns in, he takes off and
hangs up his oilskins, places his sea-boots
carefully on top of his chest, in order that
they will remain dry should the fo’c’s’le be
flooded out, removes his outer garments, and
places them at the foot of his bunk, and, his
simple toilet being completed, he turns in.
Uncomfortable and dreary as the fo’c’s’le is,
it seems the acme of comfort when com-
pared with the deck. For a few moments
they stand huddled in a little group outside
the fo’c’s’le door, until their eyes grow accus-
tomed to the darkness, and then make their
way to the quarterdeck, where they are
joined by the bos’n, carpenter and sailmaker
(known as “idlers” on account of keeping no
watch, and consequently having "all night
in”), who have also been turned out to
assist. With the three mates and six
apprentices there are 26 men on deck, none
too many to handle the canvas of a big, four-
masted barque in a Cape Horn gale. The
Mate, who is in supreme charge of this job,
quickly apportions his forces.
“Starboard watch to mizzen tops’l! Port
watch to main tops’l! Look lively now, you
limping hoodlums, lay hold of those down-
hauls. Lower away tops’! halyards, Mister.
Haul on those downhauls now. Some of
ye tail on to the spilling lines. Put some
weight into it, you. slob-eyed Dutchmen.
Pull, Gol-damn ye, pull."
Slowly the heavy topsail yards come down.
So strong is the upward pressure of wind in
the great sails that they have to be dragged
down by main force.
A white mass of water rises up from over-
side. Out of his alert weather-eye the
Mate sees it coming. “ Hang on, everyone,"
he ye 115.... Crash! comes the sea on to the
deck, pouring over the men, tearing them
away from their holds, and sweeping them
into the scuppers, a confused mass of men and
ropes. Breathless, battered and half
drowned, they drpg themselves up to the
downhauls and spilling lines again, and re-
sume their pulling, up to their waists in icy-
cold water. Time after time they are
swept away into the scuppers, but at length
they get both topsail yards down on the
caps of the nnlsts, and the spilling lines
hauled as tight as possible. “Lay aloft and
furl ’em.” is the next order, and everyone
but the Mate makes his way aloft to the
swaying topsail yards.
I suppose that everyone at some time or
another has cliriibed a ladder, the ladder
being quite steady, and probably held in
place by someone. Consider, then, what it
would mean to climb that same ladder on a
dark, dirty night, whilst the person holding
it below swayed it' violently to and fro over
an arc of say, 60, degrees. If you can
imagine that you Will arrive at a very faint
conception of what going aloft in a gale of
wind means. Up,, up we go, with the reel-
ing mastheads swaying drunkenly above us.
Up to the futtoek rigging, where, while still
climbing upwards, we also have to climb
outwards, and where for a few perilous
seconds we are hanging back downwards,
still up, over the top, and into the topmast
rigging, until at length we come to the
yard, and the flapping, banging, canvas devil
we have come to subdue.
There is a sea proverb which says, “One
hand for yourself, and one for the
owners.” But this in most cases is
impracticable, as one usually requires
both hands to get a sail (especially
one of the large ones) in. So most ships
have fitted on the yards, ropes known as
“lifelines,” which pass along outside the
back of the men on the yard, and this
allows them to use both hands to the sail.
The men spread themselves along the yard,
and. when everyone is ready they reach up
with both hands and dig their fingers into
the vast wall of canvas, which is swaying
and oscillating like a captive balloon. For
some time no impression whatever is made
on it; then, little by little, inch by inch, we
gather it in. Then BANG!....a sudden
hard puff of wind has torn from our hold
everything we had gained. Never mind!
Try again.... Dig your fingers in, sons.
Never mind if your finger-nails are torn off.
This sail has got to come in some-
how ... .Now, altogether. Notv we’ve got
her... .Another hard puff....lt is slipping
out of our fingers again.... Hell! Hang
ou to it, boys.... Here she comes....
Inch by inch we gain it once more.
Now we are able to reach over the
top of it. A man sits down on the jumping
footrope, and throws a gasket up over the
fore part of the sail. After several attempts
it is caught, and then passed again....
Good. Slowly, but surely, the great thresh-
ing sail, struggling against captivity like
some huge wild animal, is conquered,
stowed, and securely lashed along the yard.
It has taken over an hour to do, but it had
to be done, so it was done. Whilst we
have been furling the main-tops’l, the Sec-
ond Mate’s watch has furled the mizzen,
and there now remains the fore-tops’l to
furl, and, the biggest job of all, the foresail
to reef.
The fore-tops’l does not take so long, as
we are able to get all hands on to it; then
once again down on deck to haul the fore-
sail up, preparatory to reefing it. A tick-
lish job this, in a heavy gale. The Mate
climbs up on to the deck house, where he
can watch both sides, and the Second and
Third Mates are ready to slack off the
sheets. The Mate’s practised eye takes all
in. . . .Everything ready ?... .“Slack away
handsomely on the sheets,” he roars ; “haul
away on your clew-garnets.” This is a big
sail, and takes some hauling up ; but gradu-
ally the clews creep up to clew-garnet
blocks, and bit by bit the buntlines and
leechlines draw the huge sail up to the yard.
Then the reef-tackles are manned, and
hauled out (seafaring men will remember
that it was the reef tackle that placed the
historic Dutchman in a very awkward posi-
tion). Once more all hands lay aloft, and
out on to the foreyard, to tackle the biggest
job of the night.'
Two hours later they struggle down to
the deck again, tired, half frozen with the
bitter cold and stinging, driving spray, many
of them with bleeding finger-tips, but filled
with satisfaction that the worst of the work
is over. The foresail is reset, though not
without some difficulty, and the Mate goes
to report progress to the Old Man. On the
faces of the men there now comes a very
peculiar expression. They all look aft as
though they were waiting for something.
Presently it comes. From the poop there
comes in the Mate’s stentorian voice the
welcome words, “Grog Oh.” Very eagerly
this time the dog-tired men make their way
on to the poop, and find the steward shelter-
ing in the cabin companion-way, with a
copper kettle filled with rum in one hand
and a pannikin in the other. As each man
comes forward he has a liberal tot of the
fiery spirit whacked out to him, which
courses like fire through his half-frozen
body, and puts new heart into him. The
skipper looks at the Mate. “That’ll be all
just now, Mister,” he says. “That’ll do the
watch,” shouts the Mate in his turn, and
the watch below make their way forward
to the fo’c’s’le, to put on dry clothes, if they
are lucky enough to have any, and to gener-
ally make the best of the short while there
is left, for it is now nearly four o’clock.
With the tops’ls off her, the ship is now
running much easier, and although still
shipping a lot of water, it is not nearly so
bad as before. Also we now have an oil-
bag hung from each cathead, which largely
minimises the power of the seas. Five
o’clock comes, that hour always beloved of
sailors the world over, as by old. old cus-
tom, that is the hour when piping hot coffee
is served to the watch on deck. And how
welcome it is on a morning like this, after
a night at sail drill, only those who have
been through it know. Six o’clock comes
round, and with it the first welcome beams
of daylight. A frightful sea is running.
Heavy black clouds race madly across the
slowly reddening sky. whilst gigantic
combers, with mile-long breaking crests,
roar away to the eastward on their eternal
journey round the world. But what do we
care now? We are making a fine, fair wind
of it, the ship is running well, and with any
luck we shall be round the Horn to-morrow.
Presently full daylight comes in, and five or
six miles to the northward of us we see the
grim, desolate Diego Ramirez Rocks, throw-
ing the spray a hundred feet into the air,
as they defy even the mighty Cape Horn
rollers to shift them from the foundations
the Lord made for them. Another eighty
miles, and we shall be abreast of Cape Stiff,
and then it won’t be long before we have
pur jibboom pointing north, with the girls
of East India Dock Road hauling in the
slack of the tow-line.

The
Importance
of
Efficient
Insulation!
Tlie importance of efficient insulation, in many cases, is not realised. Great
care is shown in the selection of a steam plant to ensure the greatest economy,
yet the insulation which is of equal importance is in many cases partly neg-
lected. If you strive to make a saving in the steam consumption of your
engine, why not make certain that it is not wasted again through faulty in-
sulation ? The claims we make as to the exceptional efficiency of Newall s
Coverings are fully borne out by actual test. and. further, by the enormous
sales, including repeat orders, and we do not know of a single instance where
any other covering has been used once Newall’s have been tried.
The Ultimo and White Bay Power Houses are insulated throughout with
Newall’s Coverings, and this material has also been adopted exclusively by the
N.S.W. and Victorian Governments. These are facts which will tend to fur-
ther prove our claims. The innumerable advantages of this material over all
other forms of lagging are described in interesting booklet, which we will be
pleased to mail you along with samples.
