The Red Page
Eight Months to Go!
Within a week of the announcement of
Tub Bulletin's £l7OO Prize Novel Compe-
tition, the first bundle of MS. arrived at.
the office ; and since then it has been joined
in the safe by a few others. But these are
works, of course, that the writers had on
hand: they rushed them along to get early
in the queue for the £5OO first prize that is
to be awarded within a few weeks of the
closing ol' the first competition on June 30
next.
From what The Bulletin can gather,
the Gloria or some other light is being con-
sumed in a hundred back-country homes
in Australia in a laudable effort to win
this prize and all that it means besides
in the way of fame and profit;
and no doubt almost, every profes-
sional and semi-professional story-writer
in Australia will “have a shot at it.”
There is one thing in particular about the
competition which seems to be generally
approved—no man’s - style (and no
woman’s) is cramped. The competitor must
be either Australian-born or bona fide resi-
dent ill Australia (Australia meaning also
Maoriland and the South Pacific), but
beyond that there are practically no limit-
ing conditions. The story need not even be
Australian in setting, though this Page will
be horribly disappointed if the competition
does not produce many printable stories
with an Australian background.
The competition has attracted a great
deal of attention in England and in the
U.S.A.; and in England especially the size
of the prizes has been commented upon
wondei'ingiy. Incidentally, many compli-
mentary things have been said about The
Bulletin ; . but that doesn’t matter. One
large American firm has got in early with
an offer to publish the prize story, and it
suggests terms very alluring to the winner ;
but, while this is very gratifying, no
arrangement of the sort will be entered into
beforehand. The successful writers can
make their own arrangements with both
European and American publishers; the
profits on such book publication, by the
way, will belong wholly to the writers.
Naturally The Bulletin hopes that the
competition will produce a fine crop of
great, stories; and, to that end, if anybody
desires any further information about the
competition, The Bulletin will be glad to
supply it.
“Newman as Man of Letters"
Dr. Joseph J. Reilly, whose book with
this title has been published by Macmillans,
has a line gift of portraiture, the pen of an
artist and a keen appreciation of his illustri-
ous subject. And his illustrious subject
has long been in great need of such a pen.
For most people still think of Newman as a
pale, intellectual ascetic, whereas in fact he
was a man possessed of great magnetic gifts.
In his 23rd year his powers as a preacher
had so ripened that his passionate fervor
kindled the souls of young Oxford and
brought them worshipping to his feet.
His moral courage was phenomenal. No
man suffered more at the hands of critics
and bigots on account of his inevitable
mutations, and no man over retained so
large a measure of respect from friends and
foes when ultimately lie severed his early
ties ahd took refuge under the shadow of
Rome. Men might doubt his wisdom and
call his logic casuistry, but no one who
knew him ever doubted his sincerity. When
lie left his pulpit and church at St. Maiy’s
“his going,” said Principal Shairp, “was as
when, to one kneeling by night in the silence
of some vast cathedral, the great bell, tolling
solemnly overhead is suddenly gone still.”
Newman wrote two novels, “Loss and
Cain” and “Callista.” But his stories were
simply “by-plays of genius done en passant
by a man who was a preacher, controver-
sialist, a poet, a historian and a theologian
before he was a novelist.” “Callista” is an
attempt to imagine and express, from a
Catholic point of view, the feeling and
mutual relations of Christians and heathens
in the third-century period to which it
belongs—really a sketch of an era, with
little or no dramatic power; defective,
moreover, in the frequent intrusion of the
author’s person and opinions to the detri-
ment of the narrative. Newman pleaded
guilty to writing some 200 poems, and con-
fessed that he found prose hard and verse
easy to write. He speaks in one of his
letters of composing poems while he was
shaving. He turned to verse as a relaxa-
tion from the exactions of prose. Yet the
“Dream of Cerontius” was no mere effort of
relaxation, but a genuine and beautiful
outpouring of the.faith that was in him. In
“Lead, Kindly Light” he gave us what
perhaps, despite its obvious angularities, is
the most popular hymn in the language.
Its author said of it that it was neither a
hymn nor suitable for singing. None the
less, it is sung in innumerable churches all
the world over —a fine tribute to its divine
sincerity and its poignancy.
Historical writing claimed a considerable
part of Newman’s time in his earlier years,
and he penned a series of papers on the
subjects that absorbed him. “Arians of the
Fourth Century” was a work of 400 pages
—exhaustive, tense and of deep interest to
ecclesiastical students. Singular to say,
he was an assiduous reader and warm
admirer of the sceptical Gibbon, to whom
he admits his obligations. The “Church
of the Fathers,” wherein he depicts Augus-
tine, Basil and Gregory and others of the
Church’s champions, followed the Allans,
and two papers, “Mediaeval Oxford” and the
“Convocation of Canterbury,” came next,
but evoked little interest from students of
literature. Color is lacking in his historical
work. To Carlyle belonged the drama of
history; to Macaulay its pageantry; to
Newman its philosophy;
It was as a controversialist, however, that
Newman won his most lasting laurels. A
primary source of his power lay in his per-
fect knowledge of the matters at issue.
“Reflect,” he says, “reflect, how many dis-
putes you must have listened to which were
interminable because neither party under-
stood either his opponent or himself.” The
point of this he never forgot. He modestly
disclaims the title of theologian and yet
makes himself master of every phase of the
difficult problems of infallibility which he
and Gladstone discussed.
Space will not. allow us to deal with the
famous “Apologia,” wherein he ground
Kingsley to powder; or with his famous duel
with Father Aelvilli, who had created a
furore in England by denouncing the
church from which he had been expelled;
or with his relations with'Cardinal Manning,
a, churchman as worldly as Newman was
spiritual. One defect of Dr. Reilly’s admir-
able book is that he ignores the grave
scandal of Manning’s treatment of the.
noble Newman; those interested therein
would do well to read Lytton Strachey’s
"Eminent Victorians.”
Dr. Reilly’s book is full of interest and
color. He writes with sympathy and in-
sight. and carries the reader without an
apparent effort.
P. AIREY.
"Youth Is at It Again”
An Australian university woman who had
lived some years in the United States said
that America’s mission to the world was
to show by example what not to do. The
remark was made without bitterness, and,
more significant still, without humor. One
could be more complacent if one could feel
sure that Australia is pi*ofiting by America’s
experiments.
The remark was recalled by reading
Judge Ben Lindsey’s book “The Revoll of
Modern Youth.” The Judge, so he tells
us, has presided over a “juvenile and family
court” in Denver since 1899. But a piquant
aspect of the matter is that he holds the
office subject to re-election by popular vote.
This fact, should be borne in mind in read-
ing the book. The problem he deals with
is Serious—for the United States, and prob-
ably for the rest of the world. Race sui-
cide, licentiousness and divorce are eating
out American life to such an extent that,
but for the influx of aliens, the United
States would be visibly dying, and the
much-sough t-for 100-per-cent. American
bids fair to become as rare as the unicorn.
Meanwhile the negro is increasing, and
Japan is much nearer to America in point
of accessibility than the Huns and the
Goths were, to ancient Rome when sithat
empire was discovering the “new” morality
which Judge Lindsey lays before us.
There is not one constructive suggestion
in the book. Inflated verbiage imperfectly
conceals muddled thinking, and a Peck-
sniffian superiority discloses a total, failure
to grasp the seriousness of the situation.
“About us,” writes Judge Lindsey, “is a
body of newly discovered truth capable of
. fulfilling and preserving all that was sound
and permanent in the traditions and cus-
toms of our forefathers.” But I vainly
search this 360-odd pages for one gleam of
illumination as to what this truth is. We
are told that “education of the young in
the whole subject of sex would sweep most
of this evil out of existence.” But in the
prevention of wrong-doing, mere; know-
ledge has never proved very successful.
Case after case is quoted which shows in
these young people not only knowledge of
sex, but a precocious cynicism whose guid-
ing principle is the desire not to get found
out, and the knowledge of how to attain
that end.
But, Judge Lindsey -might reply, they
have got their knowledge in the wrong way.
Very likely. In a community where “the
number of 'separations and divorces is equal
annually to the number of marriages,” it
seems quite possible that the children’s
ideas of sex relations are obtained in the
wrong way. But in this muddle of tandem
marriages, who is to instruct, them in the
right way? And, above all, what are they
to instruct them about? Physical facts are
useful but not morally persuasive. And
any suggestion of a moral law makes Judge
Lindsey fairly foam at the mouth. He
relates the story of a child of 15 who had
“gone the limit” and is discovered by means
of a letter—a revoltingly cynical production—
which she writes to the partner of her tran-
sient joys. She is entirely shameless; but a
little anxious at the prospect of being found
out. Yet she is described as “a perfectly
normal healthy girl with a womanly
instinct for the sacredness of sex,” and the
author spends a page or two of ungram-
matical fury on the “Pecksniffs” who ex-
pelled her from her school—-without any

serious consideration of the fact that she
was not “promiscuous” and had had only
one “lover”—up to that time!
Judge Lindsey also tells the story of
Maude, who was “living on the square with
Bill, like a true married pair.” His sug-
gestion that they should get married pro-
duced the scandalised reply: “Married.
Why, I’m earning more than he is right
now.” Shortly afterwards she went on an
automobile tour with Bill’s successor,” and
Judge Lindsey predicts that “she will marry
him in time, as his income is apparently
ample.” Maude “is not a bad girl.” She
is “crude and raw,” “but she demands oi
any man she may marry the ability to make
a fair living. She is, on the whole, taking
better and more intelligent care of herself
than many of her moral and respectable
friends.” So it appears that even the barn-
yard affinities of these delightful young
women are subordinated to the sacred
morality of dollars.
It is suggested by Judge Lindsey as by
others that this undisciplined conduct on
the part of young girls is due to the
“maternal instinct.” But there is abundant
evidence in his own pages that maternity
is the one thing they do not want. And if
they do want it, then it is worth noting
that their Puritan ancestors, to whom Judge
Lindsey accords lip service without suggest-
ing the sincere compliment of imitation,
accomplished maternity on a large scale in
a simpler and less expensive manner with
far less pother.
Judge Lindsey asserts that the applica-
tion of a system of eugenics will do away
with the evils described. Yet on another
page we are told that “the type of youth
that lacks energy, self-confidence and initia-
tive, is unlikely to get into trouble.” Also
that “among boys of a certain type, more
inclined to independence of action young
athletes,” the percentage of sex-irregularity
“would run much higher” than the average
50 per cent. So, if a race of eugenic super-
men were produced, God knows what would
happen!
Trial marriages are solemnly suggested as
another panacea. But with 50 per cent, of
the community divorced, that scheme seems
to be getting a fair spin already—and still
Judge Lindsey is not satisfied.
The tragedy and the comedy of the whole
book is, of course, its author’s assumption
that he has some message to give to the
world. But he fails to explain just why
we should dethrone religion, tradition, law
and morality and cast their whole mantle,
like an ill-fitting eiderdown quilt, on Judge
Lindsey. Why must we bow to his deci-
sion that sex license is merely “overflowing
high spirits and abounding energy” if its
votaries take their experiences tandem, but
that they must be mildly, very mildly,
rebuked if they take them abreast? The
generations that have passed believed that
God spoke a law with thunder on Mount
Sinai, and that His wrath would fall on
those who disobeyed it. That such a belief
did give a reason and a rule of conduct
must be admitted even by those who dis-
pute its origin; and I fail to see how we can
effectively substitute for it a code of life
laid down by Judge Lindsey sitting in an
armchair, with the electric light turned on—
not even though he has the advantage of
being assisted in it by his wife.
As I read this book, certain lines from
Kipling kept fluttering on the horizon of
memory. I got up and sought out the
quotation:—
It chemically combined loathsome familiarity, leer-
ing suggestion, slimy piety and rancid “social ser-
vice” into one fuming compost that fairly lifted
me off my feet.
Thank you, Mr. Kipling.

Francis McCullagh
Francis McCullagh, who came this way
with the American fleet, is his own best
disguise. He is one of the most daring war
correspondents the world has known, and
he looks like an overfasted monk. There is
about him always a hint of the cowl and
the carrel. He is no paper’s man. He
seeks truth for its own sake, not for its
effect on syndicates or nations. He has
sought it over the width of the world, and
the story of a more romantic life’s farings
has seldom been told.
McCullagh leapt into fame by his account
of the battle of Port Arthur. He was on
the ship that slipped out of the bay, and
was thus able to give the world the news
three days ahead of any other journalist.
He has been in every war in the world
since then, and he has as many languages
at his command as he has fingers. He has
been the prisoner of more than one Power.
He shamed Italy by his account of Tripoli.
He penetrated into the wildest recesses of
the heart of Europe to get the truth about
the Balkans.
But it is in connection with Russia that
his name is best remembered. He was on
a Russian newspaper when the war broke
out, but left it to join his own countrymen,
the Irish Fusiliers. He was a captain in
the shambles of Gallipoli. “What I saw
on Gallipoli I could not write, - ” he told me;
“it went too deep.” From there he went
back to Russia, to Siberia, with a British
mission, and saved it by a knowledge of
Russian when Koltchak and his British
sympathisers were defeated by the Bol-
sheviks in 1918. Disguised, he penetrated
alone to Ekaterinberg and was the first non-
Russian to reach the scene of the Czar’s
death, and to interview his executioner.
By his account all subsequent accounts
have been measured. He was the sole
European eyewitness of the insolent trials
of the Patriarch and the Catholic Arch-
bishop, and his book, “The Bolshevik Perse-
cution of Christianity,” is a classic of its
kind. Later he gave to the world Lenin’s
renunciation of Communism. It brought
incidentally an apology from Hughes,
the U.S. Secretary of State, who had denied
the truth of the story. He will go back
to Russia some day, for it is his Merlin,
his spellbinder.
Now he has beaten the world again with
his story of the true state of affairs in
Mexico. He could not have done it had
he not spoken perfect Spanish. His articles
are denunciations. He charges the State
Department with concealing the truth about
Mexico. He charges the Morgans and other
United States capitalists with supporting a
disgraceful despotism south of the Rio
Grande.
Mexico, according to McCullagh, is in
a worse state than Russia. The charges
made against the State Department concern
the fate of hundreds of Americans, im-
prisoned or dead within the Mexican
borders. He says women, including nuns,
are herded in underground gaols with sol-
diers and criminals. He tells a tale of
terrorism and graft, of tortures and execu-
tions. He has affidavits from British and
American residents to support his allega-
tions, and these are the evidence of eye-
witnesses. He denies the progress of edu-
cation in Mexico and supplies figures in
rebuttal. He says that ever since Carranza
the revolutionaries have been destroying edu-
cation. He claims that agricultural laborers
are quitting Mexico in their thousands for
the United States. These and other charges
are hurled against the Mexican oligarchy
and its United States sympathisers and sup-
porters. Civil war is inevitable.
McCullagh is the lineal descendant of the
old explorers and buccaneers. He goes pri-
vateering for news as Magellan and Fro-
bisher went sailing for continents. Usually
he has given America news of other nations.
This time he gives her unwelcome news of
herself. Journalists who are not war cor-
respondents will be less concerned with the
political significance of his feat than with
the proof it furnishes that derring-do still
lives among knights of the pen.
EILEEN DUGGAN.
Melba’s Successor
I do not see where “G.A.P.” (R.P. 6/10/’27)
and I “disagree” re the importation of a
first-class singing teacher for the Sydney
Conservatorium. He says: “There is a lack
of first-class teachers not only in Sydney,
but in every country. If a top-notcher is
to be got for Australia, he must be sought
anywhere in the world and paid his price.”
In my article I said: “It is time the Sydney
Conservatorium considered the advisability
of scouring Europe for the finest singing
teacher it can give us.” Although the
epidemic has somewhat abated, there is
still a constant “whip-round” amongst
musical enthusiasts for the purpose of send-
ing yet another vocalist away for tuition.
Although the teaching fees of the world’s
best are enormous, if we added together
the sums collected for the purpose of dis-
patching budding Melbas and Carusos to
the other end of the earth, we should have
almost enough in hand to engage the angel
Gabriel to teach trumpet-playing.
“G.A.P.” says that Harold Williams’s
name should have been included in my list.
He is quite right. Williams is a fine artist
and I regret that he was omitted. In fact,
I regret that a lot of people were omitted,
but I was not in the position to comman-
deer the whole space of the Red Page.
I cannot conceal my pleasure that the
discussion has created so much interest in
London. The trials and tribulations of the
little band of Australian musicians who are
striving to make good in the most critical
city in the world are known only to those
who have tried the same game. And we
want them all to know that, here in Aus-
tralia, we are following their steps with
sympathetic interest and national pride.

A Satchel of Books
Essays and Addresses on the Philosophy
of Religion, by, Baron F. von Hfigel (Dent).
A second series of the late broad-minded
author’s essays and addresses.
The Unlucky King, by J. H. Lawson
(F. C. Johnson). A story of the days of
Richard 11., whose rashness in making
proiftises which were impossible to carry
out led to disastrous consequences and his
downfall.
Tragedy at Ravensthorpe, by J. J. Con-
nington (Benn). Cases of agoraphobia are
not frequent, but an inheritance of the ner-
vous fear of open spaces constituted the
family secret of Ravensthorpe. Full and
plenty at this travellers’ inn.
Mother Knows Best, by Edna Ferber
(Heinemann). A set of short stories, from
the first of which the book takes its title.
American in type they spare no time for
literary style or delicate dissections of
character, but get on with the story.
Narrative Dialogues from the Bible, by
Alfred Clegg (Heifers). “Fresh interest is
imparted to a Bible story,” says the author,
“when young people can represent the actual
characters therein.” This is an attempt, then,
to make dialogue out of various Bible
stories. It is not a striking success.
Mediwval London, by Gordon Home
(Benn). In collaboration with Mr. Edward
Foord, who placed his exceptional knowledge
of history at Major Home’s service in a pre-
ceding volume, “Roman London,” the author
here picks up the story at the year 457
and carries it on to the closing days of the
fifteenth century; and he has given life and
color to the volume.
The Curse of the Reckaviles, by Walter S.
Masterman (Methuen). When Sir Hugh
Reckavile, a very evil knight who feared
neither God nor Devil, staked his soul on
carrying off the young wife of the Lord of
Glarne, and was foiled in the attempt, he
paved the way for a thrilling story by a pen
dipped alternately in black and blood-red ink.
Meanwhile, by 11. G. Wells (Benn).
Here, under a camouflage of fiction, Mr.
Wells makes an attack, as vulgar as it is
virulent, upon Mr. Baldwin and members of
his Ministry over their conduct of affairs
leading up to and during the general strike
in England. Whatever the strength of the
coalminers’ case, sympathy wall not be won
for the men by such advocacy as that of
Mr. Wells’s puppet.
Drugs and Doses and Bottle-feeding of
Infants (Edgar Smithers). Two booklets
issued under the “Nursecraft series.” The
pocket materia medica for nurses, by Dora
Vine, should prove also of use in the house
hold where Tommy is frequently dosed by
rule of thumb; while Mrs. Ilaldin appef"
to know all there is to know about the
bottle, and some suggestions as to what
makes bahy cry may interest father.
The Shaping of English Literature, by
Amy Cruse (Harrap). In the shaping of a
country’s literature the influence of the body
of readers has to be taken into account as
well as that of the body of writers. Each
reacts upon the other. In this spirit the
author traces the readers’ share in the de-
velopment of literary forms from the day.
of the Saxons to the end of the eighteenth
century. Very interesting and well com
piled.
Devotion, by Juliet (Edward A. Vidlei.
Melb.). Juliet sold 5000 copies of an earlier
book, largely as a result of a Red Page
article describing her as Australia’s own
Ethel M. Dell. In her quiet way she is a
Victorian bestseller. In her latest story
there is more atmosphere and less plot. A
sheep-station is the background for some
quite sharp delineation of character, though
the interest thins out a little towards the
end. The writer’s limpid sincerity is her
great asset. Sincerity is rare these days.
“Pll Have a Fine Funeral,” by Pierre La
Mazi&re (Brentano’s; Robertson and Mul-
lens). A Paris gamin witnesses the interment
of a senator of the Republic and resolves that
he too will be buried with pomp and circum-
stance when he dies. He is—or, rather, the
author leaves him in the position to be.
How he gets to that position is the subject
of the story. An unusual book—sometimes
a beautiful book, which, in the fierceness of
its hatred of war, conventional patriotism,
“Business, Robbery, etc.,” frequently forgets
to be a novel and becomes a pamphlet.
Prefaces, Introductions and Other Uncol-
lected Papers, by Anatole France (John
Lane). An English translation with a fore-
word and notes by J. Lewis May, who, iti
collaboration with the late Frederic Chap-
man, edited the works of the great French
author for “The Bodley Head” series. In
addition to the numerous prefaces and intro-
ductions to other men’s books, many articles
hy Anatole France were hidden away in the
files of newspapers, reviews and magazines,
and these, or such of them as could be
. traced, are now collected and presented to
l the public. Many of the papers—such, for
1 example, as the Essay on Victor Hugo and
. another on Ernest Renan —will be devoured
: by the increasing body of English readers
of this outstanding French author.
Clairvoyance and Materialisation, by Gus-
tave Geley (Benn). The purpose of this
book is to substantiate the supernormal
phenomena, the result of experiment at the
International Metapsychic Institute, Paris,
by the records of the investigators. It is
the first of two volumes and purports to be
a simple record of facts, leaving to its suc-
cessor the inferences to be drawn therefrom.
The second part of the present volume, on
which special attention is centred, deals with
materialisation, or, in technical phrase, “ecto-
plasmic form.” During trance a portion of a
medium’s organism is externalised. This por-
tion is sometimes small, sometimes very con-
siderable. This withdrawn part or ecto-
plasm may be either solid or vaporous. At
first formless, it becomes organic, condenses,
and forms then appear, which, when the
process is complete, “have all the anatomical
and physiological characters of biologic life.
The ectoplasm has become a living being or
a fractional part of a living being, but is
always connected to the body of the medium,
of which it is a kind of prolongation, and
into which it is absorbed at the end of the
experiment.” This certainly is a phenome-
non, which, to secure general acceptance
would require a very exceptional body of
proof; but the author declares: “This fact
is substantiated, with formal proofs, by the
common consent of scientists from all
countries.” The book is well illustrated and
will appeal to all who are interested in
research into the shadow-land of psychic
phenomena.
The Buccaneers, by A. 11. Cooper Prichard
(Cecil Palmer). Professor Prichard in this
historical sketch strips much of the romance
from the figures of the rovers of the sea.
“The comic opera and irresponsible boys’
stories,” says this Truthful James, “have
gathered around the very real history and
tragedy of those sea-rovers —who never were
pirates except individually—a mist of absurd
legend and exaggeration, crossing even over
the borders into the burlesque.” The first
buccaneers came mostly from the Norman
region of France and settled down on the
mainland of what is to-day Central America
and the peninsula of Yucatan, but princi-
pally on what was then called “the Mosquito
coast.” There and scattered through various
of the West India islands they formed with
the many other adventurers who joined them
a sort of rude confederation under the name
of “Brethren of the Coast. Unlike the
ordinary settler, they never tilled the soil;
they lived the free life of hunters—hunters
especially of wild cattle —and had they
been left unmolested by the Spaniards little
more would have been heard of them. The
persecutions of the Dons drove them to revolt,
and from hunters of wild beasts they de-
veloped by stages through the Indians’ canoe,
the ship’s boat and the stolen vessel into
rovers of the sea capturing Spanish ships
outward bound with rich cargoes of treasure
from the mines of Chile and Peru. If the
author displaces a figure of romance, he
erects another hardly less fascinating and
picturesque.

Dream.
Sho moves unshapen in the formless night,
Star-led, a voice of melancholy seas
And lone isles far, where in the drowsy
ease
Of warm and nodding noons the lazy light
Shakes from the creeper on tha valley wall,
Through rainbows rising from a waterfall.
As vague and hesitant as dawn’s first sigh
\\ hen through the waiting leaves a
trembling note
Falls in a ripple from the forest throat,
She stays not on the airs nor passes by,
But far, from slumber's unhorizoned height,
Makes island music in the singing night.
She weaves the mystery of night’s caress
Where in the solitude of timeless hours, j
Deep in the vast, dew-veiled, the star-eyed
flowers
Dance in the dusk to see the shepherdess
Of fleecy mists in pathless meadows deep,
Pluck nodding poppies in the fields of sleep—
Pale priestess of the gloom, whose holy hands
Draw back the veil, before our numbered
days
Awhile, to slumber’s deep unquestioning
gaze,
Glimpsing the green hills far and laughing
lands.
Where, in the nightless shade, tired life’s hot
breath
Drinks deep the petalled airs of flowering
death.

ROBERT MUIR.
The Orient in Queensland.
The dry cold wind tosses along the street
Unfettered leaves and scraps of paper,
tears
A loosened blind; then, sly and very fleet,
A bald-head’s hat in scurrying circles
bears
Beyond his angry hand. An evil sprite
Comes with the westerlies from smoky
hills,
Some sneering jinn, some venomous afrite,
That wounds shy fancy, and pale glamor
kills.
Yet through the dust I caught a gleam of
bronze,
A strip of scarlet by a fretted globe;
Behind a crystal pane a rigid bonze
Hides his long hands beneath a lacquered
robe.
The porcelain Buddha seems to shake with
mirth
Perched on his stand of carven ebony;
Secure he sees the capers of the earth,
Dreaming the silence of the mango-tree ;
Watching all day the shifting of the crowd
About the window, jesting at the wind
That W’astes itself in conflicts wild and loud
And seeks for nothing it can ever find!
Tanged with gum-leaves, with dust, with
city smells,
The westerly comes roaring round the
quay.
The bonze and Buddha wait; but neither
tells
The priceless secret of complacency!
One sees his reflex in a round brass tray,
Whereon a dragon sprawls; one in a
string
Of amber beads can wateh himself all day
A dozen times reflected, as they swing.
Old silver lures this buyer pewter that.
Woman in furs and men in greatcoats
pass.
How many centuries has the Orient sat
Watching the West, and wondering
through a glass?

Riding Home.
Over the ridges, by forest-clad lea,
Fast I ride, fast I ride,
To lose myself in a leafy sea,
To bury myself away from the heat,
From the glare and clamor and hurry of
street,
To find my soul as the miles drop past,
To open my lungs to the first keen blast
From over the range.
Up by the saddle to Hurridane Peak
(Haste thee, good steed!).
There on the summit the west winds will
speak
(Haste thee, good steed!).
From the height of King’s Cornice thei’#*
spreads at my feet
What the eye out-travels your paces to greet.
The plains of Combogle don’t have any
streets,
And few are the homesteads the traveller
meets
Over the range.
The bushman’s sky over the bushman’s head
(Your hoofs are beating in time, I said).
And last month’s magazines still unread!
The bushman’s silence away outback.
The bushman’s jokes when he gets with his
pack—-
You can’t beat these in your city streets,
Or hear as good from the men one meets
Over the range.

The Gazers.
At murk of day we gazed between the boles
Of mossy trees through that Hercynian wood
AY here horror lived and supped upon the good
Of all strayed sweetness from the pleasant
knolls
Of sunny Ardennes and the south where
rolls
The happier Danube warm with wine and
food.
Huge slayers, blood-bespattered, hairy, rude,
Peopled the dark that fumbled for our souls.
Yet passionate wonder plucked the sleeve of
fear.
Beyond the shadow green enchantment held
Dim court of dreams, star-sweet on lake and
hill,
With magic music that warm nights made
clear.
Through bloodied teeth the ogre Odin yelled
And made a sharp, bright trembling of the
will.
On the grey boulders of the western sea,
Chilled with the sharp blown spray and
stunned with sound
Of shouting waters that the world around
Had raced the stinging wind-whips to be free,
We stood and gazed, while pulses tremulously
Clamored of golden lands and marvels found
Beyond the haze where ocean long had bound
With winter fears our fathers’ destiny.
The dreadful ocean and the narrow decks—
Planks, cordage, sails, the compass and the
stars
To lift us through a thousand leagues of
dread!
All shores we knew were sown with broken
wrecks
And sorrow moaned along the river bars;
Yet the great blossom of the world bloomed
red.
AVeary upon the border of the years—
Years of the crowded knowledge and distress
That ever told us more and gave us less —
We stand with discords stinging hearts and
ears
And wonder of the future that the tears
Of all the striving past desired to bless.
Hard on our burdened souls w T e feel the press
Of trade whose bales were as the blight of
spears.
Yet not for dread of that w’hieh yet may be
Dare we be blind to dreams that still must
rise,
Dreams of brave living and of peace made
kind,
There shall be wonder on the land and sea,
Wonder of open hands and crowds grown
wise
In the vast commune of the world’s full mind.
Shall we yet gaze at infinite bright places
Over the valleys where the lost dreams went
And the warm trembling hopes in mist were
spent,
Fainting from truth with pale averted faces?
Even now strange characters have left their
traces—
A r ast words too fine for thinking—on the rent
Blue cliffs of life’s last magic continent —
So near, so far, so rich with all the graces.
Despair, the foil of triumph, fills the dark
Between the worlds and systems and the cry
Of infinite nothingness whose fume and nod
Leaves a blank sadness, naked, dreamless,
stark—
A stone for bread and life an ill-told 1ie....
Shall new truth go adventuring with God?

DAVID MCKEE WEIGHT.
The Country Lad.
He came from out some wind-swept place,
Beneath the open skies.
The sun had lain along his face,
Green fields were in his eyes.
He walked alone down crowded ways,
As to some secret tune
That wind among the barley plays
Beneath a mystic moon.
I watched his feet grow faltering there,
Within the sounding street.
His shoulders sagged that used to bear,
Unhurt, the heavy wheat.
The sweating walls and chimney-stacks
Leaned o’er him, every one.
He only saw through narrow cracks
Thin beams of prisoned sun.
I saw him go, this country lad,
Back to the open skies.
He could not stay, because he had
Those green fields in his eyes.

Dissatisfaction.
I have succeeded and my soul is sick,
Since all my labor has but won me this
Vain privilege of doing aught amiss
And having merit judged me. Though some
quick,
Cold critic pull my reputation down
Beyond my rescue, since my strength is
spent,
I have achieved, and I should be content
Because I have not come short of my crowu.
I have succeeded, and the fellowship
Of seeking sets me by. The bitterness
Of the event is mine • do I not know
High failures are : remembered, while I slip ■
To swift forgetting with my small success,
Because I, striving, set my aim top low? •

“The most serious problem facing the N.S.W. Composite Ministry, which took office this week, is finance. It is estimated that to carry on Public Works in
progress it will be necessary to borrow £10,000,000. The railway and tramway finances constitute a problem that will have to be faced without delay. The Minister m
charge of Local Government has had to refuse all appeals for new works, and the funds available for the relief of the unemployed will be exhausted by the end of the
week.”

THURSDAY. OCTOBER 27, 1927.
THE PHANTOM OF THE NO-HOUR
WEEK.
The Federal Treasurer is a well-meaning
man with too many disappointing intervals.
He has an honest desire to pay off some of
Australia’s foreign gold liabilities out of
paper surpluses, but it can’t be done; in fact,
nothing can be done except wade deeper
and deeper into foreign debt so long as the
country buys so much abroad and sends
away so little to meet the bill. If this
truth was emphasised, in and out of season,
even this easy-going community might
begin to feel it soak in. But some people
would proceed to call the speaker a Jere-
miah and a prophet of evil, and some more
would call on him to produce his plan for
making the trade balance better, Protec-
tion alone being insufficient while “awards”
travel so fast that they often leave the
tariff standing at the post and looking like
a non-starter. Probably Earle Page doesn’t
want to be called a cheerless creature, and
possibly he lacks the courage to expound
the extraordinary measures which the more
than extraordinary situation calls for. At
any rate, he relapses a great deal too often
into a vein of apology, and one side of the
Page is so unlike the other that they appear
to be out of different books. This, for
instance, was from his recent address to an
Institute of Accountants, including prob-
ably some young men who will themselves
be Treasurers one day:—
“In the last five years the public debt
of thp , Commonwealth had increased by
£44,997,000, of which £43,226,000 was repre-
sented by loans raised for the States. The
increase of the Commonwealth public debt
in the five years was therefore only
£1,771,000.... Figures showed that, in its
early stages, the United States was a debtor
country, with an excess of imports or ad-
verse trade balance, till the position was
reversed. With wise expenditure of loan
money, there was no reason why Australia
should not reach the same prosperity as
America.”
It is distorted fact and rotten logic, and
the individual who teaches that sort of
thing, whether to accountants or others,
should be classed, save for his obvious good
intentions, with the boss of a Socialist
Sunday-school or the head of a Fagin
academy for young Oliver Twists.
* * * *
The United States doubtless had adverse
trade balances at times, especially before it
learned that effective Protection is a good
thing for a young country with high am-
bitions; but its surplus of imports never
amounted to over £5 per inhabitant in a
single year as Australia’s has done, and it
didn’t float great foreign loans to pay for
them or to meet the interest on previous
loans either. The George Washington
republic began its career in debt by reason
of the bills for the War of Independence
and for the row with Britain in 1812-14.
Not regarding the condition as desirable, it
paid off the last of this liability in 1836.
After that the republic kept pretty con-
sistently out of debt till the War of Seces-
sion began in 1861. It issued bonds for a
small campaign or two, but it paid them
off, its fixed aim being self-dependence. The
process of repayment was resumed after
the stirring events which set Uncle Tom
free and after the very stirring Great War
it was again resumed, and to such purpose
that nearly a quarter of the amount has
already been liquidated. The U.S. didn’t
achieve prosperity by foreign loan devices,
and especially unlimited loan devices. Nor
did any other country—not even Russia or
Turkey or Egypt, though the three prac-
tised the lOU habit hard enough.
❖ * * *
The Treasurer, as is usual, put a gloss on
the situation with passing allusions to the
interest on the war debt, though that con-
stitutes only one-third of what Australia
owes in its State and Federal capacities;
and to the heavy charges for humanitarian
proceedings such as invalid and old-age
pensions. But these things have no con-
nection with the fact that exports fail so
disastrously to meet the bills for goods
purchased and for interest. The increasing
struggle after the No-Hour Week is much
more responsible. Certainly the war
burden is no Australian specialty; nor, for
that matter, is humanitarian legislation.
Among the countries which have the old-
age pension system are Great Britain, the
Irish Free State, Denmark, Iceland, France,
Germany, Poland, Maoriland and Spain.
Britain, Denmark and Maoriland grant
widows’ pensions, and the first-named has
an orphan pension arrangement in addition.
Insurance against sickness exists in Britain,
Germany, Switzerland and Poland, and in-
surance against unemployment in Britain,
Germany and Holland. The family or
child endowment project wasn’t ex-Premier
Lang’s patent, though his idea about the
finding of the money was, for France and
Spain have their own forms of endowment.
Britain and France add confinement allow-
ances, and France throws in something for
the nursing mother so long as she is nurs-
ing. Russia is said to give a number of
these benefits likewise, though the most
popular authority, the “Statesman’s Year
Book,” omits to mention them. So Aus-
tralia doesn’t hump the burden alone, and
except for the grotesque baby bonus it
isn’t known to have pioneered anything in
this category. Sometimes, in fact, it fol-
lowed a very long distance behind the
pioneers. As a rule it is well up in the list
for liberality, but then it has a pile of loan
money and great public land revenues to
dispose of.
When all things are taken into account
Australia, though not very rich by
nature, has nothing extraordinary the mat-
ter with it, and it does nothing extra-
ordinary, either for itself or for humanity,
that it should be such a persistent dweller
in the pawnshops of the world. Nor is there
any visible cause why its borrowing poli-
ticians should make so much fuss in ex-
plaining the hard lot which drives it there.
The strange and abject subservience to
imported revolutionaries and destructionists
which has characterised the Australian
unionist in recent years, and the intensive
pursuit, at their bidding, of the phantom
of the No-Hour Week, account for the
troubled situation well enough. If the situ-
ation has lately become worse it is because
the subservience to the imported revolu-
tionaries has become worse, and with it,
of course, the further slowing of the
worker’s hand and the wider opening of the
worker’s mouth.
ARE WARSHIPS DOOMED?
According to Admiral Sir Cyprian Bridge.
one of the greatest modern writers on naval
strategy, it was Thucydides who first, more
than 2000 years ago, realised the importance
of sea-power. The Persian naval forces
were responsible for the invasion of Greece
in the first great clash between Europe and
the East. It was the lack of control of the
sea that forced Hannibal to cross the Alps.
It was the handing over of the direction and
execution of her naval policy to incompe-
tents that led to the ruin of Athenian power
at Syracuse. In more modern times the
English, the Dutch, the Spaniards and the
French had their periods of world suprem-
acy whose permanence and security were
directly proportionate to and dependent on
control of the sea. And it was when George
III. allowed the Royal N'avy to decline
almost to the point of disappearance that
we lost the American colonies.
It is small wonder therefore that, as sea-
power is exercised per medium of ships,
from time to time attempts have been made
to evolve something that will negative sea-
power and render surface warships useless.
The invention of gunpowder might have
been hailed as such a factor until the ships
themselves starter 1 to use it and evened
things up again. Fireships were a deadly
menace to the old wooden craft, but they
did not succeed in eliminating them. The
first torpedo looked as if in its perfected
form it should be capable of effecting such
destruction in a fleet that warships could
not operate. And the mine and mine-field
would seem at first glance to be sufficient
to restrict the movements of men-of-war to
such an extent as to render their construc-
tion a waste of money.
But the surface ship has for 2000 years
survived all challenges. As each new chal-
lenger appeared, the brains behind the sur-
face vessel devised means of combating
them, and when possible adapted the new
terror to serve as an auxiliary and an
adjunct to the craft which always have been
the symbols of sea-power and maritime
supremacy.
Now there has come a new challenger, and
history is doubtless repeating itself in the
acclamations of those who confidently
announce that sea-power is a thing of the
past and that in future nations will rise and
fall according to the extent of their control
of the air. The airship, aeroplane and sea-
plane are to be capable of effecting the
destruction of fleets, which are deemed to
be helpless against them, and the whole
questions of defence and attack, of national
power and national weakness, are to go into
the melting-pot—are, in fact, already in it.
It may be so ultimately, but the nations
like ourselves which depend on sea-power
would be very foolish to take it for granted.
Proof can only be obtained in actual war;
meantime, however, we can arrive at some
fairly definite conclusions. The worst
enemy of any aircraft is another aircraft,
and the value of an air-fleet will depend
exactly on its ability first of all to rid the
air of the enemy’s air-fleet. This must of
necessity be a lengthy process, even given
a superiority at the beginning and dis-
counting any ability on the opponent’s part
to make up losses by the rapid construction
of replacements.
Advocates of the potency of aircraft are
apt to imagine them as being able to attack
a battle-fleet entirely unmolested by other
aircraft; but when it comes to the point it
would seem far more likely that all that has
been achieved by recent advances in the
art of flying is to ensure that future wars
will be fought in the air as well
as on and under the water, and that
of the three different kinds of fight-
ing the ultimately deciding war will be
that between the surface vessels. Sub-
marine warfare was new to all intents and
purposes during the late war. but the under-
water craft left the big ships practically
unaffected, being much too busy protecting
themselves from their natural enemy—
destroyers and other small surface craft,
even trawlers and drifters and motor-
launches. These kept the submarine down,
just as we may presume the aircraft of one
side will strain every nerve to keep those
of the other side no. For the efficiency of
an aeroplane attacking an object on land or
on the surface of the water must always
depend on height. This could be modified
by enabling an aircraft to fire a gun so
that the height factor, which is really a
time-of-flight factor, may be negatived by
giving an initial high velocity to the bomb,
shell or other missile designed to damage
the warship.
Neglecting air resistance, the time taken
by a body to fall even 3000 feet is between
13 and 14 seconds, and the aircraft dropping
it, must be in an absolutely exact position,
depending on exact knowledge of her height
and speed and those of the target. If, how-
ever, she could impart to the projectile an
initial downward velocity of even 1000 feet
per second, which is less than half the
muzzle-velocity of a shell fired from a naval
gun. the time of flight would be only a
shade over 2-|- seconds. In the one case the
aircraft has to allow for the events of a
period of 13| seconds, in which a 25-knot
warship will have moved 570 feet, and in
the other case for only three seconds and
127 feet.
This time of flight is one of the principal
factors contributing to the inaccuracy of
naval gunneiy, but it is largely overcome,
or at any rate reduced in effect, by impart-
ing a velocity of up to 3000 f.s. to the pro-
jectile. Until aircraft have been designed
that can stand the shock of the explosion
necessary to give such an initial velocity to
a heavy enough projectile, results are not
likely to cause much damage to an intelli-
gently handled ship or fleet, even after its
own defending aircraft have been overcome.
I do not wish to discount the value of
aircraft in general; I admit they will be a
nuisance. But it would be a mistake to be
stampeded by spectacular performances and
pictures of sham air-fights at Hendon into
the belief that the surface ship is doomed.
The multiplicity of Atlantic and other flighu
and the publicity they naturally receive,
together with the recent Schneider Cup race,
have directed popular thought to the air
and have tended to induce the conclusion
that air-power has already superseded sea-
power. At present this is an entirely fallaci-
ous conclusion. The surface ship has sur-
vived previous challenges and is quite
capable of surviving this one.
N.N.O.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Some Votes Are Not for Sale.
It is widely believed by politicians, Nation-
alist as well as Labor, that the people have
a craving for what is called “humanitarian
legislation” and are careless of the cost.
If the belief were well founded, govern-
ments which go in for that kind of legisla-
tion ought to be eminently successful at
the polls. As a matter of fact, they fare
rather badly.
The Fisher Labor Government thought
to make sure of the 1913 Commonwealth
election by introducing the maternity bonus
just before it went to the country. Good
as its record was, and substantial as its
majority had been, it was beaten by the
dull “Liberal” party led by Joseph Cook.
Apparently a large number of electors re-
garded the maternity bonus as a tawdry
bribe which they were morally bound to
resent, and voted accordingly.
The N.S.W. Dooley Government intro-
duced the 44-hour week in the Government
transport services and undertook to extend
it to all and sundry. It promised mother-
hood endowment also. When it faced the
electors it was routed.
The N.S.W. Lang Government based all
its hopes of conquest on “humanitarian
legislation.” It said it had given the people
the 44-hour week, widows’ pensions, multi-
plied workers’ compensation benefits and
child endowment, and was going to give
them more child endowment, more widows’
pensions and unemployment insurance,
among other boons. It circulated a mass
of literature (some of it in the form of
expensive full-page advertisements in the
dailies) claiming that its “humanitarian
legislation” had banished misery from in-
numerable homes'. And throughout the
campaign it was persuaded that these
“arguments” would prevail. “I’ll win 50
seats,” said the cocksure author of the
“humanitarian legislation.” He actually
won 40 —40 in a House of 90. Some of his
dispirited followers are now blaming
“humanitarian legislation” for their defeat.
The crude child-endowment measure is
specifically mentioned, and there is a sus-
picion that many working-men’s wives
voted Nationalist and Country-party be-
cause they are fed up with the 44-hour
week.
The truth is that the people have a great
deal more sound sense and feeling and
honesty than the professional politician has
given them credit for. They don’t take
kindly to election-time proposals to buy
their votes wholesale and blow the expense.
They suspect that. much of what passes for
“humanitarian” legislation is really “grand-
motherly” legislation, and they have no
more use for that kind of thing than their
forefathers had. In short, the old sturdy
spirit of self-respect and self-reliance in
these matters is by no means dead. The
electors of the most populous Australian
State have told their legislators very plainly
that they have no wish to see politics be-
come “a dirty business,” to see elections
degenerate into vast competitions in
bribery and corruption, to see the helping
of lame dogs over stiles—a good thing in
moderation—carried to such crazy lengths
as to let lame dogs set the pace for the
whole community. That is the great and
lasting lesson of October 8; and it is a
lesson from which Bruce may profit as
well as Lang and Bavin.

The Value of Australian Factories.
Victoria has spent, within the last few
years, almost as much loan money on land-
settlement devices as the other States com-
bined, so it should be a shining example
of the progress of what are called the rural
or primary industries. Actually, these are
some of the results: —
Gross Output of Victorian Industries.
1917-18. 1920-26.
Agricultural . . • • £14,401,173 £13,702,818
Pastoral and cow .. 23,609,727 24,420,210
Mining 1,500,230 1,667,528
Forests .. . . • • 1,039,800 1,912,46"
Hen, rabbit, etc. . . 2,645,036 5,442,61"
All “Primary” . . . . £43,195,966 £47,145,626
Manufacturing .. .. £67,066,715 £119,986,439
And if only the value added in process oi
manufacture (the value of the work done m
factories) is taken and set against the
gross output of primary industries, the
figures were £24,933,079 in 1918 and
£48,041,916 in 1926.
The inferences are: (1) Manufactures
are better suited to the State, and perhaps
to other States, than the primary jobs,
though the man on the land might do
better if he was given a chance to make


use of the port nearest to him; and (2)
during the great loan period secondary
industries got on six times faster—or ten
times faster, measured by value of output
—without having over £25,000,000 spent on
them than the primary ones did with
that artificial aid.
The manufacturer may not supply so
many imports as the primary man, but lie
saves a great deal in imports, often of
cheap-labor and non-union make, which is
quite as good and probably better.

A Compulsory Slum Residence for
Judges.
Justice James had an off-day recently in
a small N. S. Wales country town, there
being nobody to try; and he made it the
text for a preachment on the beautiful
diminution of crime in Australia. This,
like some other recent pronouncements,
shows the sunny outlook natural to the
gentleman with a safe and honored job at
£2600 per annum, only a little domestic
establishment on which to be taxed for
workers’ insurance and child endowment,
and no Court to tell him that he must
work his factorv-’ands less and pay them
more. Provided Ins liver is in order, the
world ought to look a good place to him.
There are people, though, who lean to the
idea that the finding of slain bodies lying
about has become a habit, and that the
failure to find the person who slew the
body is unpleasantly frequent. Nowadays
when the police see what looks like a dere-
lict car their first proceeding is to look into
it for the mortal remains, just as they used
to look in the hansom-cab when Fergus
Hume was young, and if it isn’t there they
remark that it must have been removed,
and go in search. The list of stolen, and
often destroyed, motor-cars fills a column
or two of the morning paper, but as the
criminals, when captured, are not sent be-
fore an upper court, their Honors, clothed
in the garment of aloofness, may not hear
of these doings. And violent assault, with
or without visible motive, is too common
to be worth mentioning. There are places
both in Sydney and Melbourne where, out
of working hours, a mob varying from 100
to 400 can be procured at a minute’s notice
to maul a policeman for trying to make
an arrest.
Apart from the insufficiency of police and
the other weaknesses of the law, the most
reasonable explanation of all this is the con-
stant. teaching, largely by imported ruffians,
of the sacred duty of insurrection—of rising
against decent society and the right of
self-government. That is the sort of com-
motion which includes murder, theft,
assault, ruin of property and all the violent
crimes except suicide. Suicide is the crime
that most particularly should be in the
category, and it is out. The moral atmo-
sphere thus created tends to influence
juries and likewise to terrorise them, and,
the position being far from satisfactory,
Australian Governments ought to consider
the adoption of the Scottish, which is also
the French, system of decision by a
majority verdict.
This idea, of course, would make no
appeal to a comfortably placed gentleman
like Justice James, who regards the situa-
tion as very satisfactory and full of pro-
mise. Which suggests that his Honor doesn’t
read the papers much and doesn’t live
in Surry Hills. Every Judge who has to
deal with criminal matters ought to be re-
quired to enlarge his outlook by a term
of residence every year in some place like
Surry Hills.
“Let No Man Despise Thee.”
The Picture Film Commission still toddles
on its interminable way trying to find out
whether Australia can make pictures, which
is known already, and whether it might
save a lot of money if it made more and
took measures which would ensure that it
bought less from abroad, which is also
known. Though the commission is dull
enough itself, it now and then happens on
a bright witness. Among these was one
Gavin, an Australian with a wide experience
in the United States. He told that he had
seen Hollywood, where pictures are made
on a grand scale, “grow from a bush-track
to a great city”; that he had helped in the
construction of a film which cost £450 to
make and yielded £25,000 profit (it is pro-
bably still making profit); and that, when
he introduced a film from outside, the “other
branch of the Anglo-Saxon race” told him
the duty would be 6d. per foot. He cordi-
ally urged that showmen here should be
required to have at least 20 per cent, of
their pictures of Australian origin, which,
he said, was perfectly feasible, and added
that the millions made out of the business
are “unthinkable.” In addition he men-
tioned the contempt shown towards Aus-
tralians, as towards other non-Yankees, and
threw in the remark that “Americans would
respect us all the more when we decided to
do something for ourselves.”
Which was reminiscent of Paul’s advice
to Titus that he was to let no man despise
him. He might be hated a good deal for
his goodness, or for his energetic badness,
or for his success, or for other things, but
if he was scorned it would probably be
because he was something of a worm. And
there is the possibility that outside people
who have an intelligent knowledge of Aus-
tralians and of Australia tend to despise
them considerably. It is not creditable to
make so little and luxuriate so much that
it is quite common to be 20 or 30 and occa-
sionally 50 millions short In a single year
of meeting the year’s liabilities, and to be,
in consequence, the most notorious bor-
rower on earth. The Yankee contrives to
have large favorable trade balances, and
spends the proceeds in acquiring a mortgage
on the globe, Australia included. The
Briton’s adverse trade balance may eat up
his income from foreign investments, but
somehow or other he contrives not to float
loans abroad, but is reducing his foreign
debts.
If the U.S. is full of thankfulness because
this continent is so vast a customer for the
films which teach the rising generation that
the said U.S. is the only land on earth which
counts, and for the facility with which the
U.S. producer is able to dodge his income-
tax. it conceals the fact very well. There is,
in short, a suspicion that Australia is re-
garded by outsiders who know something
about it as being primitive, unprogressive,
lacking in self-reliance to a most remarkable
extent and somewhat mild and kickable.

The Courts, the Rich and the Poor.
When a Westralmn District Road Board
found that one of its officers had been
monkeying with the funds, an idea, brilliant
though far from original, suggested itself.
Which would profit the board —to send this
young man to prison where, since he had
committed a felony, the law said he ought
to go, or to let him off if he could arrange
for the restoration of the purloined money?
The board in its wisdom, or its shrewd-
ness, decided for the latter, and by doing
so compounded the felony.
Apparently the young man had to ex-
plore distant avenues of relationship be-
fore he could find anyone prepared to come
to his rescue. At length salvation was
achieved through a man whose wife was a
sister of the defaulter’s stepmother. A settle-
ment was made by which the board con-
sented to take no further steps if this gentle-
man would agree to make reparation. He
did so agree; the young man was absolved
and all went well till the board found itself
unable to squeeze the promised money out
of the kindhearted gentleman. Then it
went to law, presumably on its own advice,
for it is inconceivable that legal prompt-
ing could have urged it into court with
such a case. Having, at any rate, got there,
plaintiffs were raked fore and aft with his
Honor’s heaviest guns. The board,
’Sonah said, had a low moral standard —
wanted its money back and was not par-
ticular how it got it. The kindhearted
gentleman pointed out that the considera-
tion for the payment was illegal and voided
the agreement; the learned Judge agreed
and gave judgment for the gentleman and
allowed him costs; and a chastened District
Board returned to its roads.
Granted that its moral standard in this
transaction was low, cannot something be
said for the board? May it not have had
some id.ea of emulating the judicial body
in its own practice? Probably the board
had on many occasions read of similar
offenders being haled before the Court and
released either as first offenders or until
called upon to receive sentence, on condi-
tion in either case of restitution of the
stolen money. Restitution effected, they
went unpunished. No one would accuse a
Court of compounding a felony nor dare
hint that it had a low moral standard.
Nevertheless, when another did what the
Courts so often do, at least one Judge felt
that there was something wrong about the
practice. And he was right. Take two
cases. One that of the young man with
moneyed friends ready to save him from
the prison stain. They pay the price of
restitution and he goes free. In the other
case a young man neither more nor less
guilty, but having no backing of wealth,
goes to prison in default of paying the
restitution levy. The one compounds his
offence with the money of, it may be, his
father or his mother; the other, being with-
out monetary resources, serves his sentence.
A system which works out so differently
for the rich and for the poor is bad.
Yet by no means does The Bulletin
suggest that the young man should be
prosecuted and punished always and no
matter what his circumstances.. Thank
Heaven there are still employers who can
decide that it is best for the young man
and best for the community to “say no
more about it,” even where the money is
not available! And thank Heaven there
are Judges who can approve of the First
Offenders Act! But it is not so easy to
thank Heaven for Judges who are pre-
pared to make the Courts instruments for
punishing young men whose friends are
poor and releasing those whose friends are
rich.

“Lying Reports.’’
What can we do with these stunt-hunting
newspapers which are willing to invent and
broadcast the most atrocious and lying
scandals that can be confined to general
terms, and do not expose the utterers to a
suit for damages by reason of direct charges
against any individual? The freedom of
the press should be a sacred thing, like the
liberty of the subject. But when that free-
dom degenerates in either instance to the
most reckless license, the line must be
drawn. The law draws it in the case of the
lady who goes round to her enemy’s front
door in a reprehensible condition and ad-
dresses her in verbal sewage. When a
newspaper does practically the same thing
as applied to a general circumstance or
group of them, nothing can be done, though
the false and unjust attack may carry seri-
ous results to the community.
A striking example has been the recent
spreading of a farrago of sensational non-
sense concerning the landing of the Anzacs
at Gallipoli, purporting to be taken from
a draft of the British official history of the
war which had been sent in confidence to
the leading Australian military and his-
torical authorities for approval and amend-
ment, if necessary. Chief among these
faked “extracts” was one describing the
Anzacs as “a disorganised rabble” which
huddled on the sheltered beach while
“others” held the heights. As the Anzacs
were the only troops there, if we except
the Turks, the stupid carelessness of the
concoction should have been apparent to
the most careless. Yet competent authorities,
some of whom had seen the genuine docu-
ment, were shown the fiction, and stormed
against the British historian in particular,
and British troops in general. These com-
ments were cabled to Britain, and, naturally,
roused indignation there. Then Captain
Bean, the Commonwealth war historian, to
whom the genuine draft was forwarded,
came forward with the assertion that the
document contained no such expression as
that objected to, or any other in the least
likely to give offence. He added that the
English historian had given the Anzacs far
more compliments than he had dared to do
himself. But the lie, though nailed, has
been well circulated, and has stirred up
widespread bitterness in two countries at
least.
In Papua there is an excellent law which
punishes the spreading of “lying reports.”
While we are theoretically far advanced
from Papuan conditions, there are occasions
when we might well take a leaf from the
Territory’s Ordinances. In the case of the
journals under notice, one could not well
advocate fine or imprisonment for the
guilty parties, for, though we are probably
more reckless liars than the Papuan, we are
much farther advanced on the path to social
freedom than he is, and the justice which
is unquestionable at Port, Moresby would
be unthinkable here. But there are other
openings. A strict investigation by the
G.I.D. into all the facts and circumstances
surrounding the publication of the reports,
with powers of summary search and arrest
for being undesirable persons, might meet
the case.
Meantime the public is not helpless. If
it doesn’t like these lying reports, or if it
doesn’t like the journalism which thrives
on such stunts, it may be quite sqre that
it won’t get them if it doesn’t buy them.
The onus really lies not on the papers which
supply the demand so much as on the
people who create the demand.

The Irresponsible Wage-earner.
The idea that the wage-earner is exempt
from the majority of laws seems to be
making headway in many parts of this con-
tinent. It has been encouraged, of course,
by the various exemptions, dispensations and
abatements in favor of “workers” with which
the statutes bristle, and by the orations of
Labor politicians in office.
A recent case in bankruptcy illustrates the
extent to which the law sometimes is
invoked to relieve the toiler of responsi-
bilities. A young man named Smith, single,
earning about £7 a week, knocked a girl
down while riding his bicycle, and crippled
her for life. After hearing the evidence a
jury awarded the girl £l5O damages and
ordered Smith to pay £42 costs. Smith
promptly filed ms petition as a bankrupt.
An attempt was made to get an order from
the Court making a lien on Smith’s earn-
ings to satisfy the judgment, but the Regis-
trar dismissed the application on the ground
that the Court had no power to make such
an order in the case of a “workman in
receipt of wages.” But when Smith came
plong for his discharge, the Registrar, who
in this matter was not hampered by differ-
ential laws, refused to issue a certificate
until Smith paid £76 to the injured girl.
Why Smith should have been let off the
rest of his liability is not clear, but it' is
clear that on this occasion, as on others, the
laws have been used to enable a working
man to escape liabilities he was quite able
to meet.
The tendency is in the wrong direction.
Respect for the law and a sense of respon-
sibility as a citizen cannot be maintained if
the law tells a majority of citizens that
they are regarded as irresponsible. That
way lies Hilaire Belloc’s Servile State.

The City of Dreadful Waste.
One of the things which single out Can-
berra from other capitals is its multiplicity
of unfinished jobs, which include foundation
stones with nothing around them and roads
which get nowhere. There is a mysterious
thoroughfare which winds around at the rear
of “Secretariat No. 1.” Motorists returning
from the Cotter River (which is the Federal
City’s substitute for Manly and St. Hilda)
sometimes strike this road, and end up by
cursing the man who started it. Some months
ago gangs of men were put on to excavate
a long and deep cutting at the rear of Par-
liament House, and shortly before the Duke
and Duchess arrived a well-paved boulevard
extended as far as the back of the post
office. It was just the sort of road which
appeals to motorists, but it petered out near
the white stand which was erected for the
opening of Parliament. A few yards further
on it ran, and still runs, to earth, a nasty
gutter across its full width being the only
sign of its conclusion. It leads nowhere, and
work on it ceased long ago, and why it was
started not evmi the members of the Com-
mission seem to know.
But roads have always been a hobby in
the Federal Territory. As far back as 1913
the rulers of its destiny were cutting up the
soil and trying to give visitors some sort
of a surface on which to travel, probably
because they realised that the soil was so
poor that it might as well be used to drive
upon. King O’Malley took a hand in lay-
ing out these early roads, which were used
by those who joined in the ceremonies of
the first foundation-stone laying. Then the
Commission took charge, and since that
time thousands of pounds have been spent
on ripping up the original tracks. They may
still be traced, and the culverts remain—
nothing short of dynamite will shift them.
In some instances only a few yards separate
the O’Malley roads from those of the
Griffin plan, and they would have served
for many years.
Whenever anyone complains of the waste
at Canberra, Priminister Bruce or some
other potentate breaks off a yawn to tell the
interrupter that he lacks vision. Perhaps
he has the vision that Mr. Bruce lacks—
the vision to see a wasteful community get-
ting further and further in debt to the
foreigner, more and more of the population
dependent upon public jobs, followed by a
sudden stoppage of supplies, with conse-
quent wholesale unemployment, and a
nasty revolution to wind up with.
Irrigation.
In the present year of grace the only
thing Australia definitely knows about irri-
gation is that it is a darned costly busi-
ness, that it always costs a lot more than
was expected, and that there is food for
grave suspicion that it costs more than it is
worth. The most ambitious scheme of the
lot, the Murray River affair, provides a
nice, fat, juicy illustration. Just before the
Big Scrap the cost of doing everything that
had to be done was estimated at 4 s
millions. The work has been dragging on
for 13 years, has cost over five millions, and
may or may not be completed in a great
many more years at a cost of another nine
millions or so. It is now frankly confessed
that the original estimates were “little more
than guesswork, based upon very meagre
data, and in the absence of knowledge of
the subsoil and of the character of structural
work.” Of course, in addition, the price of
labor and materials rose a lot in the war
years and shows little sign of subsiding, and
two and a half years of government by J.
T. Lang and his sportive little friends be-
hind the scenes hasn’t made the job any
cheaper on the N.S.W. side. From the
Lang point of view, probably, the most
intriguing part of the undertaking was that
it mobilised over a thousand good heelers
for Lang in an electorate where there was a
Laborite who had quarrelled with Lang, and
who simply had to be taught the error of
his ways. But where the leaders have no
vision the people perish, and the optimists
who take up Murray irrigated lands—if and
when the works are completed—will prob-
ably feel just as ungrateful as do the rice-
growers of the Murrumbidgee. The only
difference that is likely to make itself appa-
rent is that, whereas the blokes on the
’Bidgee feel they are being chastised with
whips, the Murray coves will reckon that
scorpions are being used to them. A plaster-
ing of subsidies may soften the blows of
fate, but with a capital liability of 14
millions or 24 millions or 44 millions—
there’s no telling what it will be at the
finish —the undertaking is not likely to
welcome actuarial analysis.

A prospector lately sent to The Bulletin’s
Service Department an account of a mine
he thinks he has discovered; and there
certainly are attractive assays. He wanted
to be put in touch with a mining man who
would finance and develop the show. The
Service Department got in touch with one
of Australia’s best known mining engineers
—a man who has a great deal of capital
behind him—and this is what he said in
reply:—
I have found the conditions now ruling in the
industry in N. S. Wales—viz., the lack of security
of tenure; the increase of charges made by Regula-
tion ; the increased cost of stores; the shortening of
hours by Arbitration Judges (on the principle that
if an industry can’t stand all the Judges like to put
on it, then it is better dead) ; the unrest among the
men due to the doctrines, which are being preached
widely, that a mine must be the property of a
capitalist (whereas it is a co-operative society of
small and misguided shareholders), and therefore it
is wrong to do a decent day’s work; a Workman’s
Compensation Act which permits of malingering;
an Endowment Act which encourages a certain type
of man to stop work if he has enough children, and,
incidentally, loads the industry with more unrecover-
able costs; the lack of protection to the products of
the industry, which can only get the world’s parity
for its products—these added together are sufficient
to deter stouter hearts than mine. I have therefore
given up hope for metalliferous mining in New
South Wales.
And the net result of it all is that, where
12 men were employed in N.S.W. metal-
liferous mines 20 years ago, onfy one is at
work to-day.
“Lance”: The medical profession is eager
enough to fall heavily upon people who
practise medicine or surgery without ortho-
dox qualifications; but once let a man
become a doctor and he can profess to
be a specialist in any line at all. My idea
is that every doctor—qualified man, I mean
—should be allowed to display on his name-
plate the words “Medical practitioner” and
no more. Those wishing to call themselves
“aurist,” “ophthalmologist” and what not,
should have to prove to Government
authorities that they have earned the right
to the titles they desire to affect. There is
almost as much quackery in the profession
as out of it; and this would stop some of it.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Wearne, Fitzpatrick and Carruthers, who
were with Bavin in George Fuller’s N.S.W.
Ministry, are not in Bavin’s team. Fuller
was politely offered a post but would not take
it. There are 13 paid Ministers, as in
Storey’s time and Dooley’s, although there is
no apparent need for more than 10. The Leg.
Council is to have two full Ministers (Boyce
and Farrar) and an honorary (Ryan). This
is not without precedent, but it is unusual.
So unusual as to suggest that Bavin is not
so sure of the nominee Chamber as he would
like to be.
Seeing that the candle was burning at both
ends and had been carelessly left on the stove
in addition, the N.S.W. Rail and Tram
Department applied to the late Slang-Whang
Government for permission to make a heavy
increase of fares, including Sydney tram
fares, and freight rates. It said that last
year’s shortage was £738.000, and that there
would be £990,000 more to meet this year
because of 44 hours, new Federal and State
awards, child endowment and increased
interest bills. The Slangs and Whangs put
the incriminating documents aside for their
successors to find. It would have been a
worse election for Labor than it was if the
State had known what an enormous fowl
was coming home to roost.
Vic. Premier Hogan learned last week
that the Government departments had spent
£50.557 in 1920-27 on postage, telegrams
and telephones. When he recovered fcpm the
shock lie instructed the permanent heads to
arrange for a drastic cut. He has already
pruned extravagances in the use of motor-
cars and electric current, and will probably
snip off £lOO,OOO a year in odds and ends
if lie remains in office long enough. But all
the good done will be discounted if the
interest bill is to go on piling up.
The Royal Commission which is inquir-
ing into possible amendments of the Federal
Constitution has started a long innings.
Recently it spent a day over five witnesses.
One dealt with the sugar industry, which
isn’t mentioned in the Constitution. Another
testified that there should be uniform mar-
riage laws, which the Constitution authorises
already. And a third said that the Parlia-
ment should have power to make a uniform
company law, which has been widely known
for years. The other two said nothing in
particular.
“HORSEY, KEEP YOUR TAIL UP!"
“According to the report of Inspector-General Chauvel, the Australian Defence Forces are being
starved and expenditure lias to be cut in one direction to permit of progress being made in another."
BRASS-HAT BRUCE: “Corporal, the horse looks very thin and down in the mouth."
CORPORAL CHAUVEL: “Yessir. Following instructions, I stopped his food for a fort-
night to pay for a new set of shoes!”
The bankrupt Commonwealth fleet of seven
ships, which can’t grow any larger without
becoming more bankrupt, had another jest
played on it the other day. The stewards
in one of the steamers perpetrated a strike
on the high seas, alleging “insufficient variety
in their food,” and for one afternoon and
evening passengers took on their job. Now
there ought to be a shindy about the employ-
ment of non-union labor. It is high time
that the marine speck was sold uncondition-
ally to someone who will take it away out of
sight.
One of the international debating societies
which foregather at Geneva is discussing the
sinfulness of prohibiting imports. When,
for any of a variety of reasons, a country
(Australia, for example) fails to make its
trade accounts balance, and no ordinary tariff
reduces the flood of imports, the next course
is to shut articles out. The logical process
is to prohibit some costly goods that can
be done without, such as nigger-grown sugar,
and to particularly prohibit any special pro-
duct of the country that has made itself most
objectionable. The German, who misses few
points in a commercial game, wants the
nations to agree on scrapping this handy
weapon as unbrotherly. It may be difficult
to tell exactly what Fritz is driving at, but
it is generally safest to do what he doesn’t
recommend.
The Ma State’s new Bavin-Buttenshaw
Government is wondering what it ought to
do about the debauch of tin-hare betting, to
which the Slang-Whangs gave their blessing
although Parliament disapproved. Victoria’s
Labor Premier is banning the iniquity, and
Bavin and Buttenshaw should ban it, too.
Hogan says, in effect, that betting is already
illegal except on forms of racing in certain
specified enclosures which have, in most
cases, been exempted for generations, and
that any extension of this immunity to other
sports, pastimes, crazes or swindles —especi-
ally for the private gain of economic para-
sites —would be against the general interest.
It is an attitude there is no arguing against.
Giving his first casting vote in the negative
in Vic. Assembly last week. Speaker Snow-
ball heaved out the Day-Baking Bill, of
which Laborite Brownbill, of Geelong, was
in charge. The voting was 22 all on the
third reading; Snowball said that had the’
tie occurred on the second reading he would
have been disposed to vote in the affirma-
tive, as there would have been further oppor-
tunity for consideration. What he did not
say, although he knew well enough, was
that had the bill reached the Uppah Chani-
bah it would have found a grave there. One
absurd provision was that bread should not
be sold or delivered before the expiration
of 12 hours from the time it was taken out.
of the oven.
Canberra has already a stock of griev-
ances. One demand is for an elected muni-
cipal council; another is that the people
“shall be placed, as regards the franchise,
on the same footing as other Australians.”
Then the cry for the right to convert lease-
holds into freeholds is swelling. Moreover,
the tale has gone abroad that Parliament,
which isn’t long opened, will close about the
middle of December, so that remote members
may get home for Christmas, and that it
won’t come back till late in February, and
then will make a short stay, being anxious
to avoid the winter. And when it returns
after the winter its stay will be very short,
partly on account of Christmas and partly
because of the general election.
A Sydney daily breathed the flattering tale
that child endowment, estimated by Lang
to cost £9,000 000 a year, will really require
only £2 000.000 owing to the widespread ten-
dency not to take advantage of the Act. But
the tendency to take advantage of the baby
bonus is so marked that the Federal Statis-
tician records 676,590 births in five years
(1922-26) and the payment of 683.671
bonuses. When the ramshackle machinery
which the Slang-Whangs built begins to
work properly, the endowment business may
get a move on.
Tas. Senator Ogden, who topped the poll
in 1922 as a Laborite, although he couldn’t
get team-mates (Laborites who could have
had nominations for the asking have been
mourning the lost opportunity ever since),
is down on parties these days, lie recently
proposed that membership of a party organi-
sation should debar a person from sitting
in or standing for the Senate. S. Aus.
Labor Senator Hoare replied with a pas-
sionate defence of the Senate as at present
elected ; “if the great Labor movement,” the
enthusiast said, “possesses the reasoning
faculty that I believe it has, it will hang on
to the Senate as long as it has life in its
body.” This enabled Ogden to point out
that “the great Labor movement” is pledged
to abolish the Senate —as indeed it is. The
Senator who didn’t know he was an aboli-
tionist sat down.
Queensland didn’t splash like some of its
neighbors in the soldier-settlement business;
out of nearly 35 millions which the Common
wealth lent to the States for putting re-
turned warriors on the land it took only
about £2,700,000. All the same, Minister
Dunstan says the loss so far has been
£1,109,951, and an additional £314,730 lias
been spent in looking after the settlers. The
loss on the State cattle-stations is now up
to £1,116,480, and the State railways have
lost everything except their reputation for un-
punctuality. But the cattle-stations are the
worst joke. No one has ever explained what
the individual Queenslander benefits by know-
ing that he owns and pays to support the
nine-hundred-thousandth part of some bul-
lock he never saw in a paddock lie never
wants to see. It would be cheaper to give
every inhabitant a whole emu and authorise
him to take it when he felt inclined. The
emu is at least self-supporting.
Encouraged by past failures, and cheered
by the fact that the 641 millions invested
in State public works cost about 5 per cent,
per annum and earn 2| per cent., the Bruce
Government has arranged to find nearly six
millions more for Victoria, Westralia and 8.
Australia (and, of course, a lot for the other
States when arrangements are completed),
with which to buy a few more hairs of the
dog that bit them. Victoria, which has lately
spent about 33 millions of loan mtmey on
“settlement” schemes and fears that most of
it is lost, is to start an additional array of
irrigation farms (383 are mentioned), with
butter-factories and sundries; and Westralia
is to get 4J millions (it takes the lion’s
share) for railways, group settlements, etc.
Meanwhile an inquiry is mooted into the
Murray River scheme, which was to cost four
millions, and then 14 millions, and is now
shaping towards 24 millions. The craving
of citv politicians to irrigate something is a
deathless emotion.
The “All-Russian Central Executive” held
a festivity at Petrograd to celebrate the
ninth birthday of the revolution, and the
President made promises, just like Lang.
One of them was the abolition of the death
penalty except for military offences (Russia
is a whale for militarism), brigandage and
attempts to overturn the existing regime—
the sort of thing that Moscow agents do
here in the light of day and all the year
round without being even suspended.
Energy, the quality which Australia badly
lacks, is plentiful in Soviet high places.
Kay, who was elected for North Shore
(Sydney) as an Independent, and whose
seat was bought for a Slang-Whang nominee
with a billet on the Meat Board, has issued
a hoarse warning. He says that he can't
be shifted before his term is up except by
Act of Parliament, and that even if the Act
is passed he must be paid in full to the
end of his term, and that even if he is paid
in full to the end of his term the sack will
“amount to unheard-of repudiation such as
no other Government in N.S.W. has ever
attempted.” Considering that Slang or
partially Slang Governments elbowed out of
office two newly-appointed Agents-General
and a Director of Finance, there are prece-
dents enough for Kay’s removal. Still it
isn’t likely that the act of removal will
include an order that the scared bluffer shall
refund his ill-gotten salary.
Striking form on the Budget debate in
Vic. Assembly, Opposition-leader McPhair-
son exhumed the epithets used by Hogan last
year when assailing the Allancocks’ finance
methods, which Ilogan then described as
“Pecksniffian hynocrisy” and “fake,” but
later were copied in the Hogan Budget,
McPhairson said. Both McPhairson and Pea-
cock tackled the cheque super tax of a penny,
and Dunstan, whose four support Labor, sug-
gested as a compromise that the 2d. duty
should only apply to cheques of £2 or over.
Hogan wall probably take the hint. He can't
afford to offend Dunstan.
THE SICK ALDERMAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“One of the first measures of the Bavin Govern-
ment will be a bill placing municipal Sydney under
the control of Commissioners.”
’Twas merry at the groaning board, amid the
clink of glass,
To toast distinguished visitors in style,
Or in luxurious motors through the country-
side to pass,
Looking for a likely coalmine all the
while.
’Twas a pleasant job, the spending of un-
ending stacks of oof
While treating with contemptuous dis-
regard
All sinister suggestions apropos the cloven
hoof
And unworthy sneers about a bob a yard.
Aye, we had a fairish innings, with the lime-
light on the gang
Playing more intensive ev’ry year at that;
And though sundry soreheads cackled, we
were safe as long as Lang
Kept in office, auctioneer and democrat.
How we rolled the logs together, with our
tongues between our teeth.
As through tenders we industriously
dashed —
’Twasn’t always first, the lowest, or the
highest underneath —
And the ratepayers’ spondulix, how it
splashed!
I have had my share of blasting and I’ve
done my whack of graft;
I’m as game a sport as any in the clan
Which insisted on departments being
adequately staffed
With what it deemed the proper sort of
man.
For jobs alleged and splosh mis-spent and
resolutions stained
To whip the cat is useless. And although
We should never have amended our ways
had we remained
Still it’s none the less a wrench to have
to go.
They say we’ve borrowed Tammany devices
from the Yank,
And the more our deeds are probed the
worse they stink;
Hardly merited aspersion, but we’ve got to
walk the plank
And though some of us may float there’s
more will sink.
Cap. Mostyn—poor Jack Mostyn—will be
last to leave the deck,
Like all skippers famed in story and in
song;
But the fact remains, companeros, we’ve got
it in the neck.
Faith! perhaps it’s strange they stood our
neck so long.
My deep rich voice grows husky and my
mild brown eyes get dim
And the kerb beneath me seems to heave
and fall
As I loiter sickly smoking, wrapt in con-
templation grim
Of the shortly-to-be-closed-to-me Town
Haul.
I shall slumber with no carven panegyrics
o’er my grave,
No mourners placing flowers on my bed—
They’re all too busy reckoning what the
city’s going to save.
When I go underground, in “overhead.”

A Melbourne flapper claimed £99 damages
from a beauty-parlor specialist for turning
her hair, in the process of permanently wav-
ing it, from a “golden-ash blonde” to a neu-
tral affair of blobs and patches like unto a

Judge agreed that the injury had been done,
but fixed the compensation at a measly
tenner. When women justices get on the

“E.S.”: The suspicion that several Chinese
stowaways died before they could be smug-
gled ashore at Cremorue Point and were
dumped into Sydney Harbor lias been
responsible for some futile dragging opera-
tions. In any case it doesn’t square with
the religion and immemorial custom of
Quong, Yik and Co. Wherever a Chinaman
dies outside the land of his ancestors his
brethren dig him up after a lapse of time,
scrape the bones, and pack them to China.
If he does not go back in the flesh he must
go back in the bone; if he were sunk in the
sea, who could gather the relics or appease
the wrath of the offended ancestors? One
package that was sent from Cairns (N.Q.)
was recovered from an 18ft. crocodile. The
tragedy happened at a crossing in the Barron
River, where the croc, first took John’s dog, ;
and a week afterwards collected John. The
local brethren set determinedly after the
monster, as in duty bound, and eventually
got him with poisoned liver.
“Coot": In the matter of street nomen-
clature Williamstown (Vic.) has established

“Chevroford” : Victoria still boasts a toll-
gate. It confronts the motorist on Lane’s-
road, on the way to the sea-
side resort of Lome. The
fees collected from the
astounded wayfarer —he
usually knows nothing about
it till he hits it—go to assist
returned soldiers in the dis-
trict, but eventually they
will be spent on building a
new highway to the town.

WIFE: “But, dearest, you know I worship the ground you walk on.”
HUBBY: “I know you make a deuce of a fuss when my boots bring a bit of it into the

“Chancery Lane”: In the Victorian
Supreme Court the other day a juryman
who had not been challenged by either party
managed to escape the box while he was in
the process of being sworn. He had negoti-
ated the oath successfully till he came to
the “this honorable Court.” These
he apparently failed to catch, and the clerk,
realising that the man was a trifle hard of
hearing repeated the phrase. The pros-
pective juryman looked puzzled for a
moment ; then his face suddenly brightened.
“This impossible Court,” he blurted out.
“That will do,” remarked ’Sonali, drily,
“you’re excused.”
* * * *
“Wang” : Bishop Hart, of Wangaratta, is
going to have his work cut out to make
people pronounce the “Wang” as “wong”
(B. 13/10/’27). When I lived in his dio-
cese, 25 years ago, everyone called it Wanga-
ratta, or “Wang” for short. Incidentally the
abbreviation has furnished me with a pen-
name which nobody would dream of rhym-
ing with “long.” I cannot recall ever meet-
ing a resident of the Victorian town who
called it “Wongaratta” and I doubt if the
Bishop himself would sound “kangaroo” as
if it were spelled “kongaroo.” N. S. Wales
has a “Wang,” too —Wallerawang-—and it
isn’t “wong” either.
❖ * * *
“Six-and-Eiglit”: An aforetime rector of
Wallerawang would have sympathised with
Bishop Hart’s concern about the pronuncia-
tion of the first vowel in Wangaratta (B.
13/9/’27). This cleric never tired of assert-
ing that the name of the parish should be
pronounced Woller-a-wong. Once lie even
introduced the subject in the pulpit, visiting
with his condemnation miscreants who abbre-
viated the name to “Wang” and pronounced
it as if it rhymed with “bang.” Probably he
was right in his contention that he was fol-
lowing native pronunciation; it is a pity so
many aboriginal place-names are mis-spelled.
* * * *
“Baomata”: My friend “Spider,” who
usually earns a crust cutting cane, is far from
sharing the general prejudice against Italian
immigration. Before going north for this sea-
son’s work he invested his savings in colored
pictures of the Saints, the Holy Family and
other sacred works of art at the price of
about two shillings a dozen. On the trip
north he laboriously decorated every single
oleograph with a copy of the Pope’s signature
and a blessing, taking the same from a photo
in one of the illustrated journals. The pic-
tures, he tells me, find a ready market among
the Italian cutters at £2 a copy, and “Spider”
is cheerfully looking forward to an inde-
pendence in the near future.
* * * *
“Yabbie”: No doubt it’s ancient history,
but can anyone tell me why the tucker on
outward-bound Australian transports during
the war was so much worse than that on
homecoming boats, even at a time when
the U.K. was on rations and Australia
never felt the pinch of hunger? On our old
tub the menu consisted mainly of frozen
rabbits, barracouta and weevily porridge,
and little enough of those. We ate the can-
teen out four days after leaving Albany;
occupying ourselves during the, rest of the
trip with making futile protests to the
officers and heaping curses on the heads of
Australian rationing contractors. Coming
home we fed on good Australian mutton and
Argentine beef, with plenty of vegetables.
* * ❖ ❖
“Kerys” : It is indeed hard to forego the
lure of money-making (B. 6/10/’27). Some
years ago a wealthy Jew of Auckland, long
retired from business, proved a terrible trial
to his relatives, who cherished social ambi-
tions. As often as he could escape the family
vigilance the old gentleman would make for
one of the less fashionable quarters of the
city and embark on a house-to-house canvass
for the sale of all manner of trifles that he
produced from his capacious pockets. After
passing the time of day with the housewife
he would stealthily produce a small object
and thrust it under her notice, remarking
in a hoarse wnisper, “Puy a card of puttons
—kood and sheep.” Many a sympathetic
woman, sorry to see such a respectable-look-
ing old man reduced to peddling, would pro-
duce the thruppence, and the wholehearted
gratitude of the near-millionaire would make
her feel that she had done at least one good
deed that day. Sometimes the family, having
tracked the wanderer, would forcibly pick
him up in an expensive equipage as he
emerged from some cottage gate, but more
often they endured his idiosyncrasy in mar-
tyred silence.

“Mimax”: Sparks of static electricity
from the body of a car or elsewhere will
ignite petrol very readily (B. 22/9/’27),
but, strangely enough, hot sparks from a
smith’s anvil will not do so. I have seen
a blacksmith win good money by holding
petrol in the palm of his hand and letting
sparks from a hammered red-hot piece of
iron be quenched by falling in it. He
never once got burned.
THE MAGIC OF A NAME.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“At the M.U.1.0.0.F. Conference in Sydney a long
and animated discussion on the Federal Government’s
scheme of national health insurance was initiated by
Bro. Turtle, P.G.M.”
Visages each morn you gaze on, smiling,
frowning, modest, brazen,
Cuts wherewith our sheets emblazon every
item of the news;
Judges, statesmen, preachers, colonels —all
celebrities’ externals
These accommodating journals quite im-
partially diffuse.
All in Fame’s fierce light the latest, crooked-
est as well as straightest,
Least account as oft as greatest, you may
feast your eyes on them.
There can scarce exist a chap of note they
haven’t got a map of,
Yet we lack a single snap of Brother
Turtle, P.G.M.
Something in the bare recitals of that homely
name (and titles)
Wakens in my inmost vitals memories I
thought had gone,
Sends me back across the ages to fantastic
Dickens’ pages
And his quaintly furnished stages and the
folk who walk thereon.
See him rising at the table as the chairman
calls his label—
What a monicker the babel of discordant
tongues to stem !
Leech or Cruikshank might have set him
down so no one could forget him.
Pity that they never met him, Brother
Turtle, P.G.M.
Name intriguing and arresting, name insis-
tently suggesting
Doves in quiet fir-trees nesting, oil on
troubled waters poured,
How could anyone possessing appellations so
caressing
Fail to be a boundless blessing and a boon
to any board?
PUNISHING THE POOR FELLOW.
“I suppose she’s terribly grateful to you for saving her life!”
“Not a bit! In fact, she wants to marry me.”
Verbal spears, mayhap, and waddies might
have flown among the “Oddies,”
Somewhat dour, assertive bodies, all too
ready to condemn,
Ever prone to yap and yammer, but of course
you stilled the clamor
With your placid Egc’s glamor. Brother
Turtle, P.G.M.
Though to Shakspeare's satisfaction, the
olfactory attraction
Of a rose depends no fraction on the fact
it’s called a rose,
There are names that grate and hurtle, there
are others sweet as myrtle,
Appetising, too, as turtle to the practised
gourmet’s nose.
Tomlinson at Heaven’s wicket found his
name no pass-in ticket,
Peter simply couldn’t stick it and began
to ha and hem.
But a sesame potential making questions un-
essential,
He’ll concede to the credential “Brother
Turtle, P.G.M.”!

“Ess”: All sorts of laws and by-laws are
framed to keep down diseases and infections
in cities, but one of the worst contributing
evils is the tiny allotment, almost concealed
by the “single front, semi-d., all c.” In my
neighborhood are several detached singles,
where one has to stick the ladder in his
neighbor’s geraniums when he wants to
paint his wall; in the semi-detached tene-
ment Joe can’t drop his boots at night or
fall over a chair without waking his neigh-
bor. Nor is this packing exclusively a city
evil. You find people crowded together in
little backblock towns that stand like pin-
heads in a world of space. Even the tent-
dwellers seem to care nothing for elbow-room.
The other day I noticed a navvies’ camp
alongside a railway line, where some of the
married men had their wives and families
living in tents and cabooses close to the job.
The camping out might have provided a
healthy change; but the tents were bunched
together,, though there were acres of space
to spread them in.

“Corio” : I don’t know why anyone should
cavil at the English pronunciation of
“Derby” (B. 13/10/’27). It is a proper
noun, applying to a place or family, and as
such outside the ordinary rules. Curiously
enough, there are other words, not proper
nouns, where Australians sound the “e” as
“a,” following the English usage unquestion-
ingly. Such are “clerk” and “sergeant.”

“Q.N.”: A Melbourne man has just had
impressed on him the dangers of that wide-
spread practice of “putting property in the
wife’s name.” In the Civil Court last week a
Judge ruled that the will of a lady who died
recently leaving all her property (valued at
£16,000) to her sister was perfectly good in
law, however unjust it might be in fact. The
injustice came in through the whole lot
having been given to the lady by her hus-
band. who survived her. The latter con-
tested the will, but found the Court could do
nothing for him beyond directing that his
costs should be paid out of the estate.

“X.D.”: A 10-year-old Mornington (Vic.)
boy sampled the abounding hospitality of
Melbourne recently. He secured a free first-
class ride into the metropolis, visited all the
available picture-shows and fed himself unob-
served at cake-shops. After nightfall, by the
aid of an electric torch, he found an unoccu-
pied bedroom in the stateliest boarding-
house in St. Ivilda, and roosted tranquilly
there. The next day was spent in the same
way as the first, but just as the tired adven-
turer had tucked himself up in the same
bed in the same St. Ivilda mansion, one of
the maids discovered him. Distracted
parents arrived and found their lost hope-
ful being charged at the police-station as a
neglected child. It is early to forecast his
future, but it may hold aldermanic possi-
bilities.

“Russ”: The Bolshevik wireless station
RFN, Siberia, is engaged in nightly broad-
casting revolutionary propaganda, intersper-
sed with songs and musical items attractively
rendered. Nearly all the announcements
are made in Russian, but occasionally the
announcer breaks into faultless English. At
times it appears _ as if other stations are
trying to “blanket” RFN and render its pro-
gramme unintelligible, but so strong is the
transmission that it is almost always easily
tunable on a short wave two-valve receiver.

“Ex-Check”: _ “Teleg.’s” plea for a fixed
counting rule in the Commonwealth Tele-
graph Branch (B. 13/10/’27) recalls an
original comment that caused a Melbourne
night-staff man to shake hands mentally with
a casual bloke at Kalgoorlie. A long letter-
gram stuttered from the Kalgoorlie key to
the Melbourne sounder. There were some
inverted commas and, knowing that many
counter-clerks ignore them, the Melbourne
chap was on his guard. “It’s one over,” he
proclaimed before the succeeding message
could be commenced. The man on the gold-
fields didn’t hesitate. “0.K.,” he drawled.
Cut out the snake-bites!”

Herodot”: I think I can throw some light
on the manufacture of these missing heirs to
hazy millions, whose hopes are periodically
blasted (B. 13/10/’27). A few months ago
a friend of mine received from a so-called
probate agent” in London an entirely-
un solicited schedule of alleged millionaires
who have died within the last three years or
so with the suggestion that he should run
his eye over it and see if he could identify
any long-lost relatives. My friend hesitated
between a Spanish coal-merchant of Barce-
lona, a Dutch shipping magnate of Curacoa,
an Armenian rug-importer of New York and
several Jewish bankers (none of whom are
likely to have died intestate) before deciding
to, claim kinship ivith an English cotton-
spinner who had passed on in Manchester
in 1025, and whose name had some resem-
blance to his own. Expressing his belief that
this person was a long-lost great-uncle he
forwarded a postal-note for 2s. 6d. to the
probate agent, as requested, together with
some wholly imaginative details concerning
his own genealogical tree. Last mail he
received a reply informing him that after a
careful search of the records the probate-
agent considered it highly probable that he
was a descendant of one of the cotton man’s
relations who had emigrated to Australia in
the ’thirties. There was a lot more, but the
kernel of it was that another £lO would be
required to embark on further inquiries. My
friend doesn’t propose to pursue the matter
further; but he reckons he got good value for
his half-crown.
* * * *
“Unity”: Camping one Easter in an up-
country shack in Maoriland, I was assisting
with the preparation of supper, and at the
cook’s direction went fossicking in a dim cup-
board for some salt allegedly stowed there.
In the uncertain light I could not identify
the contents of a tin that looked promising
and took it into the bright blaze of the
crackling fire. Sparks flew all round and
over me, some alighting even on the tin as I
gazed into its depths. Then a sudden thrust
sent me into outer darkness, and a hoarse
Gigson got it jrorn his office boy—
who had it from the barber—
who acquired it from the dustman-
who got it from a gent who is always seen
at the course —
whose sister walks out with a friend of the
trainer.
Gigson (at his club) : “Take it from me,
boys, the horse simply can’t lose —the
source of my information enables me
to speak with the utmost confidence.”
THE TIP.
voice entreated me to depart still further
with the tin, which held dynamite, used occa-
sionally for obtaining an illegal meal from
the near-by river. The memory of that
moment still brings a feeling of queerness,
though experts have assured me that I was
in no danger whatever.
* * * *
“Mareen”: It isn’t only the Murray River
that has an attraction for the submerged
European (B. 25/8/’27). The Territory
holds many such. But, once a man goes
down here, he usually stays down, though
he may make an occasional effort to rehabili-
tate himself. Even marriage to a woman of
his own race does not prove an unfailing
remedy. There is a saying that once a man
.“goes nigger” he will never be content with
a white woman again, although nobody has
attempted to diagnose the reason.
* * * *
“Gordelphus” : They are telling the story in
Perth of a visiting Nor’-West squatter who
met an affable and prosperous-looking gentle-
man at one of the principal hotels and
spent a pleasant afternoon with his chance
acquaintance. Between drinks, the pasto-
ralist mentioned that one of the reasons for
his trip south was to buy a new car. “What
sort?” asked the other, and on being told
the make favored said he had one of the
latest models, almost new, which he desired
to sell at a sacrifice, as he was shortly
leaving for England. He offered to have it
round to the hotel in a quarter of an hour,
and the offer was accepted. The pastora-
list, having inspected the car and found it
apparently quite new and in perfect running
order, clinched the bargain and paid over
£6OO. A few days later he was stopped
in Hay-street by a detective and asked to
explain his possession of a stolen car. It
transpired that his accommodating acquaint-
ance had simply gone round to the agency
handling the brand of car wanted, paid a
deposit and asked to be allowed to try out
one of the cars for a day. The rest was
easy.
# * * *
“Akarana” : Before the days of high-pow-
ered motor fire-engines outbreaks in Nelson
(M.L.) were dealt with by a gallant little
band of volunteer fire-fighters, whose equip-
ment consisted of an old “manual.” Next
door to the fire-station was the local
undertaker’s establishment. One night the
bell pealed forth its alarm, and the volun-
teers tumbled from their beds and rushed
through the darkness to their headquarters.
When they eventually arrived at the con-
flagration the leaping flames disclosed that
they had dragged with them, not the manual,
but the undertaker’s hearse.
“Basra”: When the Australian Siege
Brigade was taking over a new position in
Prance an English officer obtained permis-
sion from the C.O. to have a look at the
batteries. When he returned he commented
upon the fine physique of the men. “But,”
he added, “are all your troops as dark as
that?” He had seen a Mauritian labor
corps at work on the gunpits whilst the
Diggers were at their midday meal.
❖
“Caveman” : A man I know has carried home
a brick in his lunch-bag every day for over
11 years. When he married he bought a small
house, and started the “one-brick-a-day” idea.
Every Christmas or Easter he uses his col-
lection in working on an extension to his
house.
❖ # *
“C.Q.”: The Salv’army gets some queer
requests. An SOS reached the Melbourne
citadel the other morning from an agitated
landlady who wanted a pair of trousers for
a boarder whose room-mate had decamped
with all his belongings except his shirt. That
would have gone, too. presumably, if he
hadn’t taken the precaution of sleeping in it.

“Topee”: Boger and I soldiered together
in Egypt in 1881. He draws the old-age pen-
sion nowadays, and knowing I am good tor a
spot generally waylays me on the eves of
paydays to remind me of the dangers and
glories w T e shared in the past. He has a
sort of sliding scale of titles for me, and the
dialogue is apt to run something like this:
“Forty-six years the month before last —but
we was young then. How's it for half a
dollar, Colonel?” “No hope this time,Roger."
“But you can spring a bob, Major?” "No,
here’s sixpence.” “Thank you, Captain! 1
propose to try him with a traybit next time
to see if I shall be de-moted to sergeant.
“Coot”: An old Adam Lindsay Gordon
landmark in Ballarat will disappear shortly.
This is O’Farrell’s saleyard, established in
1854, where the poet was once a familiar
figure whenever a horse sale was being held.
The site is being subdivided into lots and will
be sold for building purposes.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: Queer hobbies? A Melbourne
amateur snake-catcher, E. V. F. Pollack, was
bitten by one of his pet obsessions and died
in the hospital. Two days later an acquaint-
ance who knew Pollack’s habits told the
officials that if they opened a matchbox
that deceased had habitually carried about
with him they would probably find something
of interest. They did. It was a young tiger-
snake neatly coiled up inside.
ik * *
“Oxmead” : Field - Marshal
Haig received £100,060 and an
earldom from a grateful coun-
try for his part in winning the
war; I note that he has also
had a brand-new pub in Kent
named after him. This form of
hero - worship was common
enough in the old country a
century or two ago, Wellington
and Nelson being the com-
manders most favored by patri-
otic Bungs, with Admiral Ben-
bow and the Marquis of Granby
(whose exploits have quite faded
out of the pages of history) well
up in the running. But I can’t
recall that Wolseley or Roberts
or Kitchener wgs ever singled
out for such distinction; 1 sus-
pect Haig is the first soldier to
get his name on a pub sign since
the days of Raglan. Sydney has
a tavern bearing the legend
“The Hero of Waterloo.” The
chap who founded the pub was
a Waterloo private avlio wanted
to give his own colonel a boost,
but, that modest as well as gal-
lant officer objecting to such
glaring publicity, the present
title was adopted as a subter-
fuge. The hero of Waterloo,
who is commemorated to this
day in the Rocks, may have
been Colonel O’Dowd or any
other colonel you can think of,
but he wasn’t the Duke of
Wellington.
* * *
“Phil P.”: Malaita, in tin:
Solomons, where Deputy-Com-
missioner W. It. Bell, cadet
Lillies and 15 police boys were
recently murdered, has always
had a sinister reputation. The
last official whom the natives
murdered was Bowen, com-
mander of H.M.S. Sandfly ; four
of his boat’s crew perished with
him. This was in 1880. The
Sandfly was one of the small
fore-and-aft schooners built at
Sydney for the Admiralty, and
used as patrols in connection
with the existing labor traffic.
Bowen landed on Mandolina, a
small island adjacent to Ngela,
and beached his boat. Accom-
panied by one seaman he went
for a stroll; three more of the
crew stripped and went in for a
swim. A party of head-hunters
from the mainland, hidden in the
bush, saw their opportunity, and
swept across the beach, cutting
the bathers off from the arms
which were stacked in the boat.
All three men were toma-
hawked ; so was another sailor,
who was cooking. Bowen and
liis companion, one Albert Sav-
age, realising what had hap-
pened, took shelter in the bush,
and somehow became separated.
At nightfall the seaman returned
to the beach and, braving the
sharks, swam to an island about
three miles away, where he soon
encountered another tribe of
natives. Amongst these was a
returned boy from Queensland
who is said to have saved the
fugitive’s life and enabled him to
regain his ship. Bowen was less
fortunate. He, too, in the dark-
ness returned to the beach and
made futile efforts to launch the
boat. In the morning the natives
located him hiding in a banyan-
tree, and brought him down with
one of the captured rifles. Some of the
murderers were caught by a punitive party,
tied to this tree and shot.

BLUE GARDEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When days* seem drab and joys are few
My garden lifts my heart anew,
For in it everything is blue.
Violas and forget-me-not
Profusion make, and not a jot
Care they that every fragrant plot
Is just a jostling wealth of bloom;
They closer press to make more room
When baby buds come peeping through
In friendliness to make more blue.
Blue lupins make a goodly show;
An iris, petals all aglow,
Sways in the breeze; on tippy toe,
With blue my eager eyes to greet,
Climb slim sweet-peas; and at my feet
Are lovers-true, old-fashioned, sweet.
Perchance a gay, blue butterfly,
On tilting, carefree wing, flits by
Where, veiled-of-face and azure-kist,
Grows filmy, lacy love-in-mist.
A sheaf of larkspurs, straight and tall,
Adorns the shady garden wall,
And at my side, the best of ail,
A little winsome maid of two
With sunny hair and eyes of blue,
Goes prattling all my garden through.
For her, my little human flower,
Grow what-o’-clocks to tell the hour;
What wonder then, when blue the sky,
We love our garden, she and I!
VICTORIA.
LUCY HILL.
A DIVERSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I reel to-night ’neatli countless wrongs, and
with a certain grim elation
I meant to write a song of songs, a threnody
of detestation
Of this and that, and other things, in phrases
malice-tipped and stinging;
High would I mount on hatred’s wings—but
Brown, my neighbor Brown, is singing.
I burn to-night with cosmic ire ’gainst multi-
tudinous transgressors ;
With sizzling thoughts I’d feed the fire to
roast, wherever found, oppressors;
I’d shake my fist at laughing stars, my rash
defiance to Heaven winging,
I’d cry its shame for human scars —but
Brown, friend Brown, is gaily singing.
And so are worlds and gods immune to-night
from my impressive hating;
And is it, then, a magic tune that sees my
bitter wrath abating,
That soothes a soul infuriate, a tenderness
about me flinging?
No! I’ve no room for other hate —but
Brown, when neighbor Brown is singing.
VICTORIA.

In making them, only the
choicest materials are used,
and workmanship is
thorough. That accounts for
remarkable strength and
durability. Even after
months of wear these shoes
do not lose their original

Those finer souls who instinctively choose
the better things of life find sure satisfac-
tion in this make of footwear.
The name is on every pair—look for it
Jaultkaa
“Selma” : We heard of the death of King
Edward in a manner that threw the gravest
doubts on the character of our old up-
country parson. That gentleman, it was
well known, was by no means averse to a
convivial Saturday night, with two or three
of his cronies, including the village doctor,
and there were narrow-minded folk, among
them Aunt Jane, who openly disapproved of
his liking for bridge and whisky. Not a
word of the illness of King Edward had pene-
trated to our remote homestead, and after
the 10-mile drive we arrived late at church
and pulled up in the porch until the open-
ing prayers were through. Then it was that
Aunt Jane, dutifully listening through the
baize door, turned to us with a frozen expres-
sion and remarked, “I call it simply dis-
graceful ! Next time I meet the Bishop I
shall speak to him about it. I distinctly
heard the rector pray for ‘our Gracious
King George,’ instead of King Edward.”
HIS LITTLE BIT OF THE EARTH .
“What d' you think you are, Percy—a traffic cop?”
“Brilliant guess—just signalling that all the parking space on this area is occupied.”
When a few moments later we filed in and
heard the old parson open his sermon dram-
atically with “The King is dead ! Tong live
the King!” nobody blinked more amazedly
than Auntie.
“Gordelphus”: The Sydney pavement-
artist seemed to be doing better than usual
in the matter of financial patronage, and I
stopped a moment to see what was bringing
the coppers in. He had drawn, in front of
the usual series of stiff landscapes and
wooden portraits, a one-pound note. The
note itself wasn’t badly done, but there was
a touch of real art in the “Drawn from
Memory” underneath it.
“Betul”: Probably the first white man
to “go nigger” in Australia was John Wil-
son, an ex-convict, who lived
with the Hawkesbury River
natives for several years between
1787 and 1797. The tribe named
him Bunboe. He seems to have
had no object in living with
them beyond a rooted aversion
to work, but he is credited with
having been the means of sav-
ing Charles Grime, then Deputy
Surveyor - General, from an
attack by natives. After this
he was forcibly brought back to
Sydney, but he escaped and re-
joined the natives, taking a
companion named Knight with
him. In 1795 the unsavory pair
attempted to abduct a white girl
from the settlement. They were
captured and punished, but it
wasn’t long before both were
back on the Hawkesbury. The
next mention of Wilson in the
chronicles of the period repre-
sents him as member of an expe-
dition that tried to cross the
Blue Mountains, which suggests
that he had either become a
more rermtnhlo oitivan flint-
more reputame citizen or that
his bushcraft and knowledge of native ways
had created a demand for liis services.
❖
“Bert the Carpenter”: Re those cedar
fittings, of a type now unprocurable, in the
liedfern and Newtown courthouses (B.
13/10/’27). A retired cocky in Adelaide has a
dining-room suite of sideboard, table and
chairs. Albeit weighty, it is as beautiful as the
San Domingo mahogany one used to see in the
saloons of high-class steamers, and no maho-
gany I have ever seen combined so perfectly
the different figures of “fiddle-back,” “dapple”
and “tornado” in the grain. The timber
often puzzles experts, who usually pro-
nounce it to be some foreign variety out-
side their ken. It is really red-gum, grown
near Gumeracha (S.A.), and the sort of tree
that produced it lias long ago vanished, hav-
ing been all cut for-sleepers and posts.
“Mulgo” : Recently, in a Sydney suburban
bouse, I struck the daddy of all family
albums. It was in seven volumes, and an
eighth was expected to be added in the near
future. The present head of the family is a
prosperous bottle-o; some of the exhibits
were taken in all their seven ages, plus the
bridal picture and the first baby. Old
Granny, keeper of the museum, toothless,
deaf and parrot-nosed, looked upon the accu-

mulation as the treasure of a prolific life,
and smiled proudly when a new baby was
added to the legion of near and distant rela-
tions. She seemed to be always waiting for
a gossipy crony who would sit over the
human library and discuss the pedigrees of
great grandfather and his descendants, and
all their rambling and perplexing branches,
and who one and the other took after, and
whose eyes and hair they had. As a picture
show of the changing styles of dresses and
revolving fashions in whiskers, the tomes
have a certain interest besides the purely
personal one.
'!•
“Skyrider”: N.S.YV. had slips of willow
from the tree that shaded Napoleon’s grave
at St. Helena long before Anthony Beale
planted the one on his Victorian property
(B. 13/10/’27). The Wollondilly River
(N.S.W.) is lined from source to mouth with
willows, descendants of a slip brought from
St. Helena by the first Chisholm of the Goul-
burn district. There are other places in
the Ma State that claim to have acclimatised
a bit of the historic vegetation even sooner.
Even the willows along the Molonglo at
Canberra grow from Napoleonic cuttings
taken there from Baw Baw by Joshua
Moore.
* * * *
“Tristram R.”: A recent Bulletin par.
asked for the derivation of the term “The
Andrew” as applied to the British Navy.
The sobriquet originated when the St.
Andrew’s cross was first flown aft, but the
casual R.A.N. rating believes that his navy
acquired its nickname “through Andy Fisher
startin’ the damn thing.”
* * * *
“Herodot”: Melbourne’s telephone system
began in 1880 with five subscribers; there
are now over 85,000. Two of the original
five names are still to be found in the
latest telephone directory; the firm of Robin-
son Brothers, engineers, No. 1 in the first
list, still retains that eminence, and the other
survivor is James Henty and Co. The
first telephones in Victoria were installed
and owrsted by the Melbourne Telephone
Exchange Company, of which the late H.
Byron Moore was managing director, before
the Post and Telegraph Department took
them over.
* * * *
“Squirt”: Even the burglar grows more
humanitarian nowadays. The cableman tells
of a desperado, cornered in the. house of a
former Governor of South Australia, who
drew a pistol from his pocket and discharged
it in the face of a man who tried to
hinder his escape. The victim recovered,
after an unpleasant quarter of an hour, for
the pistol was loaded only with liquid
ammonia, a decided improvement, obviously,
on a bullet-propelling firearm or the savage
life-preserver that once formed part of Sikes's
equipment. But I suspect the Humane
Burglar of being less an innovator than a
plagiarist. Ammonia used for this purpose
dates back to the early days of the push bike,
when excited dogs were always threatening
the bicycle-riders’ unprotected calves. At
this stage the ammonia pistol appeared on
the market, and the dog’s day drew to an
abrupt close. The charge was contained in
a collapsible bulb handle, and a slight squeeze
ejected a spray that induced the most expert
hound to turn to other relaxations.
* # * *
“Uramao”: The cardboard-box making
trade, it was recently complained in the
Conciliation Council at Christchurch
(M.L.), has suffered more than most from
the recent developments or limitations in
woman’s wear. Not long ago the masses
of material and billows of lace that envel-
oped the female form and the huge area of
picture hats necessitated the use of large
cardboard boxes for their delivery to pur-
chasers. Now with judicious folding a‘frock
can almost be compressed into a receptacle
the size of a cigar box, and the cardboard
firms are feeling almost as disconsolate as
the manufacturers of hairpins.
* * * *
“Lao-dah”: A Praliran (Vic.) housewife
received a severe shock the other day. Some
time ago her husband, a Northern Territory
official, sent her down an abo. girl, aged 14, and
in view of the local shortage of domestics, the
lady regarded herself as specially blessed.
Recently Mary Ann Binghi fell sick and was
sent round to Dr. Featherstone, Prahran's
health officer. He diagnosed the case as
leprosy. It is generally conceded nowadays
that Biblical accounts of the disease grossly
exaggerate its contagious qualities, but a cer-
tain amount of apprehension is inevitable.
The worst of it is that the incubation period
is anything up to seven years.
❖ * * *
“Borom” : Speaking of cheap ’ and deadly
alcoholic drinks, the South African Govern-
ment is trying to prevent the manufacture
and consumption of “skokiaan” by making
the possession by natives of yeast in any
form a punishable offence. Shokiaan is
made by dropping a small quantity of yeast
into a gallon of sugared water and then
allowing it to ferment. Then there is added
some methylated spirit, a flavoring of lemon
or pineapple and a teaspoonful or so of
calcium of cai’bide. The result is a com-
pound said to have been responsible for
more riots and outbreaks among the natives
than any stimulant they had ever before
sampled.

“Coot”: An American Civil War pen-
sioner turned up in a Melbourne court
recently, when he was sued for maintenance
by his wife. The absent-minded beggar was
aged 93.

Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australasia,
Ltd., which is producing zinc at Risdon
(Tas.), began with £207,944 of capital repre-
sented by “investigational research and
general development work” and working
debits, and £44,611 by flotation costs: —

)Including special amortisation reserve, £lOO,OOO.
That the management was able to win such
extraordinarily good profits—they are only
£12,422 below the record figure of 1926 —
on a falling market is due to a bigger output,
better recoveries and lower production costs,
and the fact that the co. buys its concen-
trates at a rate which moves up and down
with m'etal prices. The drop in gross profit
was £48,890, but a cut in interest and tax-
ation charges softened the fall.
The profit claimed by the accounts is
£390,077, which is reconciled with the larger
figure in the table in this way:—

Unexplained reduction in research and
development account . . . . . . 200
Additions to depreciation and renewals
reserve 150,145
Profit as per table .. .. ..£544,607
The amounts set aside each year for de-
preciation, etc., are included with profits and
then written off in the table. The £150,145
put by last year made the total £826,077, or
approximately 251 p.c. of the £3,430,558 at
which the mines, plant and equipment stand
in the books—with trifling exceptions they are
in at cost. Of the 1924 profits the board ear-
marked £lOO,OOO for special amortisation;
last year it tossed the lot in with the depreci-
ation and renewal reserves, and the reserves
in the table have been adjusted accordingly.
They now comprise the equalisation reserve
(£160,000), appropriations for new plant
and development (£80,000), debenture sink-
ing fund (£71,567) and the balance of the
appropriation account (£188,663) ; total
£500,230 less the cost of research and
development, in the books at £170,721 —re-
duced from £207,944 in 1921.
The benefits derived from expenditure on
research is seen in the marked success
attained in treatment and recoveries; and
the good work continues. Thus costs are
kept down and prospects enhanced. Little
of value escapes. For instance, only about
one-fifth of 1 p.c. of the calcines is cadmium
and one-fourtli of 1 p.c. is copper; but
even these fragments are recovered—at a
profit, it is to be presumed. Spelter (com-
mercial zinc) is. of course, the backbone
of operations, but the by-products bring in a
tidy sum, too. This comparison shows the
progress in production since' 1923: —

Zine Silver Lead mium Copper
Tons. Ozs. Tons. Tons. Tons.
1923.. 31,283 691,062 4344

1927.. 48,605 1,134,000 7620 150 243
The whole year’s output was sold. A dis-
tinctly encouraging feature is that over one-
third of the co.’s zinc production is now con-
sumed in Australia. The technical staff set
to work a little over 12 months ago to
recover the fraction of zinc in the silver-lead
residues that went to Port Pirie for smelt-
ing and was not paid for. The result was
an increase of 5$ tons in the average daily
recovery of zinc (133$ tons). The drop in
silver and lead recoveries is due to the con-
centrates containing less of these metals;
the percentage recoveries were higher. The
cadmium and copper production was less
because the previous year’s treatment in-
cluded an accumulation of precipitates.
The co. still draws the bulk of its supplies
(zinc concentrates) from Broken Hill under
contract with the British Board of Trade.
The total quantity purchased was 1,250,000
tons, of which only 630,000 tons had been
used at June 30; the balance (620,000 tons)
is expected to be exhausted in 1933. Mean-
while the co.’s own zinciferous deposits—the
Read-Rosebery field on the Tasmanian west
coast—will be developed. Ore reserves there
are estimated at 1,400,000 tons of average
grade, and other bodies, not included in the
estimate, are known to exist. Thus far work
has been developmental; last year 41,546
tons of crudes were raised, and 31,228 tons
were treated at the Zeehan mill for 3665
tons (40 p.c.) lead concentrates and 14,534
tons (49.9 p.c.) zinc concentrates. The
main features of the milling practice to be
adopted are now clearly indicated, and the
erection of a new mill to treat 100,000 tons
of ore per annum is scheduled for next year.
Although the ores are complex, the board
has no doubts about being able to profitably
treat them. .When the mine development
now .mapped is complete minimum produc-
tion is figured at 2000 tons crudes per week.
In the Hercules mine a new ore body has
been opened up assaying 37 p.c. zinc, 8 p.c.
lead, Boz. silver and ,15oz. gold, which
is much better than the average for the
rest of the mine.
In Oct., 1924, the co. started to make
superphosphates, the gases from the roasters
at Risdon being captured. Production and
sales of super, have grown in this way:—

Tons. Tons. Tons.
Production .. . . 12,305 17,782 20,524
Sales 7,090 18,599 19,811
The demand, which is close on the heels of
production, can be expected to grow. The
sulphuric-acid plant at Port Pirie was re-
conditioned during the year and output is
now up to the anticipated figure, 60 tons
per day: this is sold to S. Aus. superphos-
phate works.

The financial position is very comfortable.
There was £1,183,138 in stocks, book debts
and cash, etc., to meet outside liabilities
totalling £858,244, including the debenture
debt, thus leaving a liquid surplus of
£324,894 compared with £323,255 12 months
earlier. During the year £164,744 was spent
on plant (total expenditure, £2.841,539),
and £18,092 on mine account (£397,287).
Stocks (£661.210) were £101,589 lower.
They are in at valuation; all that can be
said definitely is that the board knows the
metal market, but the price of zinc has
dropped £1 13s. 4d. per ton since June. Book
debts (£361,014) were £95,471 heavier; also
£21,250 was added to the book value of
shares in other cos. (£38,950), but nothing
is said as to the nature of the investment.
Paid capital is £2,600,000 in £1 shares;
1,500,000 of them are 9 p.c. cum. prefs.
which advance with the ords. in any distri-
bution above that rate. The market values
the prefs. at 31s. Id. and the ords.—there
are 1,100,000 of them —at 305., returning the
investor 7.6 p.c. and 8 p.c. respectively on
a 12 p.c. div. basis.

With the deadwood pruned out and a flying
start on the manufacturing side, better
results were generally looked for. In the re-
construction of less than two years ago the
ord. capital was written down drastically;
£322,104, equal to 16s. per £1 share, was
struck off, reducing it to £80,526. The
400.000 £1 9 p.c. cum. prefs., in which the
public is interested, suffered no capital loss,
but agreed to forego £133,000-odd of accumu-
lated divs. In return they got a 10 years’
right, commencing July 1, 1926, to an extra
3 p.c. out of the profits of any year after
the ords. had received £lO,OOO.
Things have thus far not worked out
as was expected. The combined trading
results of the two mills for the year ended
June 30 last compare with those for the
preceding half-year as follows:
1926.* 1927.
Gross profit £52,693 £115,305
Exes 26,729 76,444
Net profit £25,964 £38,861
Divs. paid 22,000 37,500
*Six months.
Of the £22,000 paid in divs. in 1926, £14,000
was from spinning and £BOOO from knitting.
The latter amount included recoveries under
a loss of profits policy following the destruc-
tion of the greater part of the knitting mill
by fire in 1925. Only half the new plant
was in position when the books closed at
June 30, 1926. Each mill then had a good
volume of contracts in hand, and the full
knitting equipment was scheduled to be at
work in December. At June 30 last the
Spinning Pty., which had been fully em-
ployed during the year, paid £28,500, equal
approximately to 10 p.c. on its paid capital
(£282,650), and the output had been sold
for some months ahead. But the Knitting
Pty. made a very poor showing and paid
only £9OOO, equal to 4.8 p.c. on its paid
capital (£186,472). Thus, after the holding
co. had deducted its exes. (£1459), there
was only £4l more than was needed to meet
prof, requirements. Production in the
knitting mill was not up to expectations
and many orders were cancelled. Unsatis-
factory management was the cause, the
chairman says, and a change was made on
July 1. But competition is keen and efficient,
which means that the co. will have to fight
hard to repair the damage done
Balance-sheet figures of the two subsi-
diaries are combined in the following table:
1926. 1927.
Paid capital £469,122 £469,122

Plant 225,267 242,217
Stocks 208,186 282,018
Book debts 121,103 130,020
To represent the holding co.’s £519,031 of
snare capital and advances, there was a
more or less liquid surplus of £180,933 and
fixed assets with a book value of £343,423;
total £524,356. Trade creditors (£231,105),
including provision for taxation, were
£83,572 heavier, and stocks (£282,018, up
£73,832) accounted for most of the in-
crease. Stocks—the amount held by each
mill is not visible in the sheet—have been
valued on a conservative basis, the chairman
says; obviously a great deal depends upon
whether the knitting mill’s portion has been
written down sufficiently.
The. combined net assets of the two pups,
including £49,909 of advances, amounted to
265. 2d. per pref. share, and 12s. Id. of it
is represented by plant, worth what it can
earn. The market, not impressed by the
past, values the prefs. at par.

Last year this co. had four more vessels,
representing 4623 tons, at work, making a
total of 33 ships aggregating 77,317 tons
apart from tugs, tenders, hulks, etc. Also
Abermain Collieries, in which the co. has a
large holding, paid 12$ p.c. compared with
10 p.c. in 1926, and East Greta, another
investment, lifted its interim div. from 4
p.c. to 5 p.c. But the Adelaide Co.’s board,
which has never been pretentious in its
claim to profits, writes the year’s net figure
at £185,901, just £llO short of the 8 p.c.
div. requirements. That, however, was after
£25,000 had been added to the insurance
reserve, making it £200,000, and £20,000
had been transferred to repairs, renewals
and replacement account, raising it to
£150,000. This Column believes both these
accumulations are true profit. Their then
contents and over a million more were handed
out in the bi'g three-for-one capitalisation in
1920. Since that date their growth has been
undisturbed. Nor is that all: an invisible
amount is provided for depreciation, ami
that the assets were written up over a mil-
lion and a half pounds seven years back with-
out overdoing it suggests that the deprecia-
tion provision is made with two hands rather
than with one. So probably even the
£230,901 of net profit shown in the table
does not represent the whole of the year’s
net earnings. However, accepting that fig-
ure, it was 9.9 p.c. on paid capital compared
with 9.6, 9.8, 9.2 and 9 p.c. back to 1923.
Thus, as far as the board discloses the posi-
tion, there is a cautious suggestion of im-
provement over the last five years. Assum-
ing that the £452,717 in Commonwealth
bonds returns 5 p.c.—and that is a low esti-
mate —then the £2,423,127 represented by
vessels, plant, freeholds, shares in other cos.
and a second parcel of Government securi-
ties, etc., brought in only 8$ p.c. net last
year. It seems a modest claim.
Additions to the fleet and other pur-
chases are reflected in this comparison of
balance-sheet figures:—
1923. 1926. 1927.

The more or less liquid surplus (£522,359).
including stocks, was £83,046 below tin
1926 liquid surplus. Coal in stock and
stores (£56,638) were £BlO7 lighter than
at the previous balance, and it seems highly
probable that this item is greatly under-
valued.
The scrip, for which the visible backing
amounts to 235. in net tangibles, is priced
at 265. 3d. on the market. At that figure
the investor gets a shade over 6 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div. basis.

and another Is. was lopped off the September
distribution. Last year’s net profit will have
to shrink 47 p.c. before it gets below £280,000,
which 2s. per share quarterly will call for.
According to the p. and 1. account, the

£498,772, and that is reconciled with the

It is impossible to say whether the whole
of the £1,817,964 in these reserves is true
profit. It probably isn’t. Mining cos’, re-
serves very rarely are. In fact, they are not
true profits once in 10,000 times; and, if ,- t
comes to that, the money actually divided
is not true profits either—a variable pro-
portion of it is capital.
Ore reserves are estimated at 4,000,000
tons compared with 3,750,000 in 1924, not-
withstanding that extraction has stepped up
from 336,185 tons in 1924 to 441,420 tons
last year. At the latter rate there is a little
over nine years’ work measured up. Treat-
ment and recoveries during last year were as

In Queen Street,
rate there is about two years’ feed available.
The crude ore from the North, where SO p.c.
of the reserves are located, assayed 15 p.c.
lead, S.Goz. silver and 12.1 p.c. zinc, com-
pared with 11.1 p.c. lead, 6.50 z. silver and
9 p.c. zinc in the crudes from the British
section. The total lead concentrates averaged
64.4 p.c. lead, 31.10 z. silver and 8 p.c. zinc,
and total zinc concentrates 6.3 p.c. lead,
7.40 z. silver and 47 p.c. zinc. It has
been decided to treat the British ores
at the main North mill when a rail-
way link is completed—probably in De-
cember. That and better metal recoveries
following improvements made in the plant
since the accounts closed will help to keep
costs down a little. They were 355. 5.9 d.
per ton in the North and 41s. 7.2 d. in the
British last year compared with 355. 4.6 d.
and 425. 11.9 d. respectively in 1926.
Most of the development during the year
was in Connection with the big ore body at
tlm 1550 ft. level, which will also receive a
lot of attention during the current term.
A new shaft is to be sunk SOOft. north of
the present main shaft. During the. 12
months £47,434 spent on mine and plant was
charged to capital, making the total outlay
£984,371. Other balance-sheet figures sum-
marise into this form :
1926. 1927.
Assets other than mine and
plant £1,945,226 £1,725,019
Liabilities 368,237 191,425
Net liquid assets . . £1,576,989 £1,533,594
Thus shareholders could see a more or less
liquid surplus amounting to 435. lOd. for
each of the 700,000 £1 shares. That, of
course, is assuming that metal stocks realise
the figure at which they stand in the books.
They were valued at £482,524 or £93,363 less
than in the previous year, but the drop in
prices has been persistent; and as final
settlements are in part dependent on prices
six months ahead of deliveries, the current
year’s profits may suffer on this account.
Remaining assets were stores (£103,873),
book debts (£3419), cash. Government
securities, etc. (£590,919), and shares in
other cos. (£544.283).
The fact that oil actually flowed last week
at Roma Oil Corp.’s No. 1 bore immensely
increased interest, and the co.’s shares
started to boom. Yet the fate of this par-
ticular bore is by no means certain, although
everyone concerned feels optimistic that it
is near a pool. Anything may happen; it
may even “come in” as a gusher. It has at
any rate been decided to let it remain under
control and see what eventuates. This is the
recommendation of the Advisory Board, and
the R.O.C. directors have acquiesced. They
have also agreed to the sinking of two
further bores, and in this work the co. will
be eligible for the Federal Government sub-
sidy. Prof. Steele’s view is that oil will
never flow up No. 1 in great quantity; and
perhaps he ought to be listened to, because
he was the first man of scientific eminence
to assert that oil in payable quantities would
almost certainly be found in the Maranoa
basin thereabouts. It is a pity that F. G.
Clapp was never taken to study that basin
when he was in Australia. To provide for
further development R.O.C. shareholders are
offered 22,250 £1 shares, five for six held, at
par. On ’change a simmer of excitement sent
the scrip from £1 to £lO in a few days,
but recent sales have been at £8 or there-
abouts.

A promising new process of distillation has
lately been demonstrated in Sydney. Fath-
ered by Motor Spirits Patents Development,
Ltd., which includes on its Board G. R. W.
Macdonald, Richard Latimer, G. 11. Blake-
more and its inventor, it is the result of years
of research by Ernest Schultz. His process,
to put it briefly, reduces the distillation and
refinement of shale oil and its derivatives to
three processes, as compared with the old
10. Moreover the whole action of the plant
is automatic, which saves a high overhead.
The older processes, too, demand the employ-
ment of expensive chemical treatments. The
new one utilises only two or three common
and inexpensive salts. Another difficulty in
the old methods was the “caking” of the
shale in the retorts. This meant extra labor
cost for cleaning, as well as loss in recoveries
and many minor handicaps. The Schultz
inventions claim to have abolished this.
Three combined units appear in the
Schultz scheme. The automatic process
begins with the crushing. Fed into the ver-
tical furnace, the broken shale slips down in
progression through gradually increasing
heat—an important point—with a mechani-
cal device regulating its progress. The dif-
ferent gases pass off as their various vola-
tilising temperatures are reached, to be
stored and condensed. The coke is ingeni-
ously disposed of, and the gases are ulti-
mately resolved into crude oil. Owing to
the periodical dropping of the broken shale
on its way down the furnace, “caking” is
prevented. The distillate, passing through
condensers, enters the second still as a thick,
dark, crude oil. This passes on through the
converter in which a couple of simple chemi-
cals do the work, to emerge from the next
condenser as benzine. The residue in the
still is fuel oil, which can be converted to
kerosene, if desired. At present, the idea is
to concentrate on fuel oil and motor spirit
only. The third and last process takes the
benzine through a cleansing. The per-
centage of recovery, both of oil from shale
and of benzine from the crude oil, is claimed
to be higher than has been previously re-
corded under any process.
The invention is only in the laboratory
stage yet, but its backers are supremely
confident that it will prove revolutionary
when undertaken on a commercial basis. It is
interesting to note that the American Bureau
of Science recently published a definition of
an ideal shale retorting plant. The Schultz
inventions, patented long before this ap-
peared. fulfil almost every requirement out-
lined by the Bureau.

Phil Collier’s obliging Government (W.A.)
continues to “assist the mines,” which are
getting more like blind beggar-men every day.
Recently the Kalgoorlie cos. appealed for
financial help owing to a further increase in
the price of firewood, and declared that un-
less they got something they would have to
close down and, incidentally, throw most of
the constituents of Mr. Collier and at least
one other Minister out of work. To prevent
such a calamity the Government, while de-
clining to pay portion of the firewood bill,
has agreed to help the cos. with the increased
cost of workers’ compensation. This means
a gift of about £Bl,OOO, which the Govern-
ment is taking from the £165,000 set aside
some time ago out of the Westralian Disa-
bilities Grant for the assistance of mining.
* * *
Kalgoorlie cos. continue to conceal infor-
mative figures concerning revenue and out-
goings relative to treatment of ore raised by
tributors. While it might not be reasonable
to expect statements of acccounts for each
of the numerous tribute parties, a summary
could be prepared monthly by each mine
showing the total quantity and average value
of ore treated on account of tributors, to-
gether with cash paid to parties and amount
retained by the co. as royalty. Great Boulder
figures'published for September are: 8732
tons ore and 3948 tons tailings yielded
£28,608 ; expenditure £27,105. Shareholders
may learn from this that costs were over
£3 per ton and that a round £l5OO profit
was made, but further than this they are
in the dark. It is the matter of royalty
that shareholders are most concerned with,
as, without knowledge of the amount of this
revenue, not even an approximate estimate
of the value of tributor-worked shows can be
formed. No doubt this covers up the nature
of previous underground supervision; but it
places shareholders and the public generally
at a disadvantage.

In the aggregate tin-mining at Herberton
(N.Q.) is doing quite well. Great Northern
is passing through a lean period, mostly pro-
specting, during which a few parcels of
medium-grade ore have been grassed. Rain-
how is looking very promising, and No. 2
winze has struck a nice patch of 15 p.c. ore.
Their last parcel of 48 tons yielded 8f tons
of oxide valued at £1542. Another similar
lot is ready for the mill. The old Bradlaugh
is likewise showing good ore, at the moment
estimated to run about 10 p.c. At the Epsom
payable ore has been fossicked from the open
cut, and it is now intended to go under-
ground and crodScut the lode at a lower level.
The Cornishman is on fair ore; 40 tons
yielded 3 tons of concentrates worth £350.

Bundi Tin’s annual report for the year to
December 31 showed a net profit of only
£3978. With £14,282 brought forward, there
was £18,260. available, from which a dividend
of Is. per share was paid last April, leaving
£14,010 to go forward. No. 1 dredge,
which started in October. 1924, has had a
lot of trouble with clay and buried timber,
and recoveries for the year under notice were
only .6371 b. per yard, whereas the original
estimates varied from 25 to 27 oz. A No. 2
dredge, of about double the capacity of No.
I—they1—they are rated at 70,000 and 144,000 c.y.
respectively—began digging in July last, but
has also had its troubles, having been hung
up for 177 hours in the first half of the
month for boiler cleaning, while shortage
of water has also hampered the output, and
made it impossible to ascertain its actual
jig capacity. This dredge, which is digging
in the Cheneh Valley section, is expected to
slioav a monthly 40 tons when in full
running order, while the Bundi Valley plant
should average 20 tons, with about six years’
work for both. The figures for the first
half of October justify these estimates. The
old dredge at Bundi recovered 12 tons from
31,000 yards, while the Cheneh plant, in
spite of lost time, recovered 16 tons from
33,000 yards, rough yardage averages being
,901 b. and 1.161 b. respectively. Returning
to the annual report, the total cash indebted-
ness of the co. was, at the end of December,
£53,722. This included a loan to Kampar
River, since repaid, and £30,511 advanced
by shareholders for purchase and erection of
the new dredge. Total guaranteed advances
by shareholders were £47,000, or about
£17,000 more than was anticipated. Direc-
tors are recommending that the original
arrangement to give guarantors an amount
equal to the dividends declared on 6000
shares in the co. from six months after the
Cheneh dredge began getting results be
modified. This modification provides that,
from the resumption of dividend-paying, the
guarantors shall receive an amount equal to
the dividends declared on 10,000 shares, in
the co. for five years. Bundi was a Malaya
Tin Corporation float, registered in Mel-
bourne in 1922. Capital is £85,000 in £1
shares, all f.p. M.T.C.’s consideration was
£6750 in cash and 28,800 f.p. shares, 1200
of which went to the original vendors. The
report has disappointed shareholders, but
there, seems no particular reason for pessi-
mism, though there was a drop in share
prices at the week-end, the last sale being
at 51s. as against the previous quote of
58s. 6d.
* * * *
Ratrut Basin and Takuapa, both sub-
sidiaries of Malaya Tin, have issued a cir-
cular to their shareholders recommending co-
operation with a view to securing, testing
and developing new dredging areas. To do
this a new co., T. R. Tin, Ltd., is to be
registered with a capital of £20,000 in
20,000 shares of £1 each. Takuapa and
Ratrut Basin will take up the shares in
the new concern jointly, thus providing the
necessary funds to carry on, and divide the
profits. Nominees from the boards of the
two cos. —two from each —will form the
directorate of the new co. Shareholders’ bene-
fits will be from the distribution of profits
from new flotations, or else from dividends
paid by cos. thus floated.. The two original
cos. will continue working their present
properties on the lines already followed.
The directorates wear pretty well the same
clothes—C. 11. Kerry is chairman of both.
The new concern is little more than a re-
surrection of Malaya Tin Corporation, which
recently set about winding up its affairs and
distributing its assets.

Most of the Malayan tin returns for the
first half of October are fairly up to form.
The Austral Malay group maintained its
output, Ivampong Ivamunting leading off
with 23 tons from 58,000 yards. Asam Kum-
bang took 25 tons from 104,000 yards for the
month of September, or .541 b. per yard.
Figures for the first half of October are 19
tons from 37,000 yards. The increase in
value is as remarkable as the decrease in
turnover. Ulu Yam only worked the second
half of September, owing to dredge repairs
being necessary, but gained 11 tons from
61,000 yards, or an average per yard of ,401 b.
The return for the first half of October is
12 tons from 40,000 yards, an average value
of, say, ,701 b. Thabawleik, which has been
the wliiteliaired boy of the group for some
time, had another good clean up, 30 tons
from 46,000 yards, whereas for September,
the figures were 60 tons from 76.000 yards,
an average of 1.761 b. per yard. The October
average is, roughly, 1.571 b.
* * * :|:
Rawang, which runs a dredge as well as a
sluicing plant, has only supplied figures for
the former for the first half of October.
The return of 15 tons from 51,000 yards is
not quite up to the September monthly
return of 38 tons from 106,000 yards, but
this may be supplemented by improved sluic-
ing figures, when they come through. The
percentage is about Rawang's estimated
average for the dredge—a trifle over .701 b.
per yard. Malim Nawar, one of Alluvial
Tin’s interests, came near the September
average with 13 tons from 60,000 yards, as
against 28 from 118,000 yards, the previous
month, but has not maintained its recent
improvement in average yield. Malim Nawar
South, with only 15 tons from 90,000 yards,
fell off from grace as compared with Sep-
tember, when the return was 30 tons from
120,000 yards; in itself a fall in output and
average from the August figures.
* * * *
# Kundang, one of the Alluvial Tin sub-
sidiaries, lost seven days in the first half
of October, owing to dredge repairs, and
worked only 140 hours to get seven tons from
25,000 yards. The dredge has been recover-
ing 30 tons a month recently, which was
about all that was asked of it, though the
present recovery wmrks out at ,60lb. per
yard, rather than the .751 b. estimated. The
new dredge, a Werf Conrad modern plant,
began to work last January, but seems to
have struck more than its share of working
troubles. Kuala Kampar, with 20 tons re-
covery from 70,000 yards, betters the Sep-
tember average, when the figures were 40
tons from 172,000 yards. Tanjong Tualang,
another Alluvial Tin show in the Kinta dis-
trict, and equipped with one of the largest
and most modern dredges in Malaya, dug
from the astonishing depth of SO feet. There
is a deep overburden of barren material —45
feet in places—and some buried timber,
too. The property was estimated to contain
20.000,000 yards of lib. and 30,000,000
yards of .G6lb. ground. The output for the
first half of October was 34,000 yards,
returning five tons. It must do a lot better
to reach the estimate.
❖ :Jc *
Phin Soon, the Malay Siamese open-cut
show, reports that the new pilot plant has
had a very satisfactory trial run, and with a
few minor adjustments should soon bo per-
manently in commission. The ordinary
treatment plant worked 101 hours in the
first half of October, and took 12.5 tons of
black tin from 13,000 cubic yards. In Sep-
tember the yield was 25.3 tons from 30,000
yards, so the average is being maintained.
If, as expected, the new electrical plant -is
running by the end of the month, the mine
will be worked full time, some 700 hours
per month, with a corresponding rise in turn-
over. The co.’s new dredge on the Haad Yai
property is expected to start digging by the
time this gets into print, and the very vexed
question of values should soon be settled,
one way or the other.

Lampeh is a modest Melbourne flotation
with a past, registered in 1922. The property
is in southern Siam, and had already passed
through several hands before the Melbourne
co. gave it a spin. After trying a suction-
cutter dredge, it was resolved to work the
property with a large bucket dredge; but it
was found that this would not do, owing
to limestone pinnacles. A small dredge
(42,000 c.y.) was installed, and this is now
digging. The September return showed
seven tons from 30,000 c.y.. though the
original boring estimate was 300 acres con-
taining 17,000.000 c.y. going lib. to the yard,
or very nearly double the present return.

Having tracked the last woolly-aphis to
his lair in Maoriland, Dr. C. J. Tillyard
has come back to Australia and is setting
out on the trail of the blowfly and liis pes-
tiferous kind. Dr. Tillyard, who is the chief
of the Cawtliron Institute, Nelson (M.D.),
when he is at home, knows as much about
insects, their virtues and their vices, as any
man living. At Parliament House, Canberra,
a few nights ago he showed members patches

of prickly-pear reduced to harmless pulp by
a tiny creature that works long hours and
overtime on its job. Queensland members
sat up and took notice, and acknowledged
that perhaps science might win where the
man Avith the hoe had suffered defeat. Mean-
time Canberra exiles would like to sool the
doctor on to the domestic fly, which buzzes
up and down the Territory in all sizes and
displays varying degrees of ferocity.
There is at least one man in Melbourne
who has been contemplating the “Zeebrugge”
film with a gleam of reminiscence. He is
Trevor Hedburg, who looks after the com-
plicated lighting of the Capitol Theatre. He
was on one of the speed motor-boats which
reconnoitred the nest of German submarines
on the night of the hectic visit. Their craft
broke down and it was let drift under the
mole. There the defect was repaired while
German sentries could be heard talking up
above. The party got safely away just as
Hell broke loose.
When Sydney drew its water supplies
from the lakes in Moore Park and the City
Council controlled the service, David Clement
Robertson was inspector of water-mains.
He began at the job in 1867. and when, 20
years later, the Water and Sewerage Board
was established he passed over as superin-
tendent of water services, keeping that job
up to the time of his retirement. lie was
then 78 years of age, and he notched another
eight before he crossed the Divide.
Ex-Senator Edward Mulcahy spent a score
of years in Australian legislatures. Born
in Limerick, he arrived in Tasmania at the
age of four. It was not until 1891, when
he was 41, that he got into the Tasmanian
Parliament. He was Minister for Lands and
Works from 1899 to 1903, but deserted the
State Assembly for the Federal Senate, in
which he sat until 1910. Defeated, he lost
only a couple of months’ salary before get-
ting re-elected to the State Parliament, and
he got back his old portfolio for a couple of
years. The Tasmanian Parliament nominated
him for a Senate vacancy in 1919 ; but his
term expired in the following year, and lie
was still out. of harness when he di*d last
week.
South Australia is the poorer with the
passing of Colonel T. 11. Smeaton. A Glas-
wegian, lie came to Australia as an archi-
tect, but his interests ranged from literature
and art to temperance and politics, plus a
devotion to defence and military problems
generally. For 16 years he sat in the S.A.
Assembly as a Labor member, but split with
the party on the conscription issue. He was
a military censor in the Big War. Muni-
cipal politics and a hundred other matters
served to fill up the chinks of 70 busy years.
When John Iligginson started running a
newsagency in Sydney the agents were at
daggers drawn, and the non-paying customer,
when his credit was stopped, cheerfully
opened a new account with the next agent.
Iligginson and Rubie were principally re-
sponsible for the introduction of the block
system. Long before the agency business
claimed him, however, Iligginson had played
another minor pioneering part; he drove
the first cable tram in Sydney in 1886, and
the first cable tram from Melbourne to
Richmond. He was 77 when he passed on
the other day.
Passed out in Melbourne, J. L. Johnstone,
the inventor of the automatic starting-mach-
ine. The remark of a spectator on the Hill
at Flemington set him thinking of that idea,
but it wasn’t the only chance suggestion, to
influence his career. A conservative race-
goer who regarded the device as little short
of Bolshevism, said to him one day: “Start-
ing horses —why, you ought ro be starting
pigs!” Johnstone took the hint and pur-
chased a dairy-produce and provision-shop,
out of which he gathered more than a little
moss.
Those who know Brigadier-General
Thomas Henry Dodds (“Tommy Dodd” to
the men of the A.1.F.) suspected that he
would not find the frilly job of Australian
military representative in England much to
his liking. He is on his way back to take the
place of Major-General Bruche as District
Base-Commandant in N.S.W. Dodds,
although born in England, was a Queens-
lander by upbringing, and a schoolmaster
before he went to the South African War.
After that excursion military work got him.
At the end of the war he left France to take
Tom Griffiths’s place in charge of A.I.F.
H.Q., London. Pie had none of the suavity
of Griffiths, and his London career was a
sequence of explosions and near-apoplexy.
Most of all his feelings were outraged by
interfering politicians; and his relief when
Tom Griffiths returned was almost pathetic.
Theatrical man Ben Fuller felt that he
had received something like a personal
compliment when R. J. Noble, M.Sc., Ph.D.,
was given the position of N.S.W. Govern-
ment Biologist. Noble was the first holder
of the Ben Fuller travelling scholarship at
Sydney Uni., which enabled him to put a
finish on a brilliant university career. The
term of the scholarship was extended at the
request of American university authorities,
who wanted Noble to complete some special
research work. Noble brings a young face
to a big job; but he was old enough to do
four years’ service with the A.I.F. His father
is an ex-N.S.W. school inspector.
When I’eter Board retired from the posi-
tion of Director of Education in N.S.W. he
clung to one voluntary job—chairman of the
board governing the. Deceased Soldiers'
Children Education scheme. Although S. 11.
Smith, his successor as Director, represents
the Department of Education, Repat., to
keep Board’s help, made a special place for
him. In six years, the scheme has looked
after the education —including University
training for brilliant scholars and apprentice-
ships in skilled trades for other older child-
ren-—of 26,700 Diggers’ children.
“Backbencher” : Glancing at Argyle (Oppo-
sition) and Brownbill (Ministerialist) the
other night in Vic. Assembly I recalled that
they occupied the seats Staughion and Han-
cock (now under the sod) used to favor 29
years ago. Although strongly opposed politi-
cally- Staughton—a Tory- ami _H.ancoek —-
a torchbearer of Labor—were close friends.
Staughton declared one night that he had
offered Hancock 50 acres of his best land as
a free gift provided he would drop politics
and work the area, but J.H. had refused
S. BIRD, Secretary of the A.L.P., Sydney,
wonders what they ought to do next.
because he preferred the lazier life. Han-
cock, who heard the offer for the first time,
explained that he had declined because
he knew that he would be hardly settled
on the block before there would be a wide-
spread demand that he contest West Bourke
against its arch-Conservative representative,
Staughton. It would be hard to resist such a
requisition and to comply would mean base
ingratitude. When Hancock returned to the
House after a long illness the man in
Staughton got the better of the politician,
and he brought their friendship back to its
old basis with an apologetic handshake.
Melbourne is not going to lose the now
familiar figure of Rabbi Brodie, the chief
Jewish minister in active commission in the
southern capital. Brodie, who has been in
Australia only a few years, recently received
an offer to take a schoolmasterly job at
Jew’s College, London. The elders of the
Melbourne congregation prevailed upon him
to reconsider his decision. Thus they have
been saved the trouble of searching for a
new man in a world in which Rabbis are
scarce.
There was a row when A. A. Watson,
who has now received the job of N.S.W.
Director of Marketing, was taken out of
the Lands Department to be-Director of Sol-
dier Settlement. Watson was not a returned
soldier, and it was considered that a man
with a badge should have been appointed.
Among other things, Watson is president of
the Public Service Association.
South Australia said good-bye to Governor
Tom Bridges just as the “Mons” picture,
which makes a feature of his famous war-
time exploit, is being shown around Aus-
tralia. He was plain Major Tom Bridges
when, finding the men of the 2nd Batt.
Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders droop-
ing with fatigue, he bought a toy drum and
whistle in a little shop, and with the aid
of a piper ratapanned and tootled the mom
to fresh effort. The cable reports that the
picture moved a German who had souvenired
the drum, which the exhausted Highland
drummer had hidden, to return it to the
regiment. Bridges commanded the West
Australian Mounted Infantry in the Boer
War.
Two of the three Queensland R.C. bishops,
Archbishop Duliig and Bishop Shiel, are
visiting Rome on important business. The
northern State looks for a redistribution of
R.C. boundaries, and this question will pro-
bably be finalised in Rome. It is expected
that Townsville will have a new R.C.
bishop. This will mean the surrender of
territory by Rockhampton and Brisbane
dioceses.
The death of Leonard Surplice recalls
some ancient Sydney-suburban history. The
firm of W. H. Surplice dates back to the
time when the now busy shopping centre of
Bondi Junction was known as the Tea Gar-
dens and was a small village to which the
dwellers in the surrounding bush came for
supplies. The old steam tram ceased its out-
ward puffing at the Tea Gardens; and the
hardy pioneers who lived at Waverley and
Bondi and the picnickers who went there on
holidays had a long tramp to their homes
or their picnicking places unless they had
buggies to meet them. That was less than
40 years ago.
The Last Post has sounded for Charles
Henry Cawood, who claimed that he was
the oldest volunteer soldier in the Britisli
Empire. Cawood was a youngster of 16
when, 68 years ago, he joined the Parra-
matta (N.S.W.) Volunteers —prompted into
existence by the fear of a Russian invasion.
He was born and lived all his life in Parra-
matta.
Ellis Bird, the old Melbourne bookseller
who passed out recently, will be missed by
many Inky Wayfarers. His shelves were
always at the disposal of needy writers and
lie took more pleasure in giving hard-up
readers access to his books than in making a
cash sale. Bird dabbled in journalism. About
30 years ago he was one of a group, which
included Bernard O’Dowd, that brightened
the Tocsin —the breeziest Labor paper that
Melbourne has produced. Later in life Bird
was connected with Furnley Maurice, F. T.
Macartney, Marie Pitt, the late Henry
Tate, and a dozen others in an effort to
launch Australia Felix, a magazine which
was to live up to its name. But though the
genius and the enthusiasm were there the
money and the business capacity were lack-
ing.
William Watson, who represents Fre-
mantle in the Federal House, tells this
against himself. He had spent a Sunday
afternoon climbing Mount Ainslie—the hill
that shoots up a thousand feet or so from
the tableland on which Canberra is scat-
tered. He proffered assistance to an old lady
who was resting near the top. She declined;
she thought she could reach the crest with-
out assistance ; if not, her son would help her.
Watson, who has just notched his 64th
year, filled with pleasure at his feat,
expressed the belief that climbing such a
height was a great performance for a man of
his years. “I am 84 and my son is 65,”
replied the old lady gently.
Anxiety in the office of the Christchurch
Press fled when George Clifford’s entry in
the Final Handicap was lately scratched.
The septuagenarian baronet’s 40 years’ dic-
tatorship of the Maoriland turf is his proud-
est achievement. The story of the flight
to Blenheim with his daughter June will
never stale. It was after the firemen on the
Lyttelton-Wellington ferry steamer declared
him black that father and daughter made

ment, which has just been extended to

that ride against time. They reached Wel-
lington by taking the Cook Strait combers
in a 14-foot launch. George thus kept his
unbroken record in the chair of the Racing
Conference and provided a leader page sen-
sation for the sheet that earns him dividends.
AT BERNAFAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Do you remember Bernafay? But how could
you forget
The long, long nights of watchfulness, the
days of foil and sweat?
How could a Digger not recall the glorious
brotherhood
That camped awhile at Bernafay, along by
Delville Wood?
Straight ran the road from Bernafay—an
easy march it seemed,
A road into a cleaner world whereof so oft
we dreamed.
Life was a simple matter then, a man knew
where he stood
When we were camped at Bernafay, close up
by Delville Wood.
We saw things clear at Bernafay, across the
sea of n.'ire,
Beyond the days of hate we saw the land
of our desire.
Oh, Dig., you must remember how, the fire-
pot going good,
We dreamed our dreams at Bernafay along-
side Delville Wood.
Now we are far from Bernafay, the road
that seemed so clear f
Grows steeper, aye and harder. Dig., with
each succeeding year.
We looked into the hearts of men those days
and found them good,
When we were camped at Bernafay, hard up
by Delville Wood.
Though it is far from Bernafay and gone
the grin you wore,
We had our hour of glory, Dig., and when
did men have more?
And some day we will meet again that splen-
did brotherhood
That camped awhile at Bernafay, close up
by DelvilD Wood.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES LINSEED OIL
“X2X”: I can recall two cases of first-
hand knowledge in which natives with black
skins became several shades lighter as the
result of being shut away
from the sunshine and light
of day (B. 0/10/’27). The
first was at the. native hos-
pital in Rabaul, where a
native who had had his right
foot and tibia badly crushed
lay for nearly five months
in a darkened ward. When
he had recovered sufficiently
to be brought out it was
seen that his skin had
become uniformly almost
grey. After some weeks the
original tint returned. The
other case was in the Eitape
district of the mainland ter-
ritory, where, in an out-of-
the-way village, two of us
found an old man in a little
hut of his own, where he
had been for years. Both
feet had been eaten almost
away by tropical ulcers, so
that he could not walk, his
food being brought to him
by the other natives. The
long confinement, practically
in darkness, had resulted in
the color of his skin assum-
ing a tint which made it
look as though he had been rolling in ashes.
* # ;!j .J.
“Kooragai”: I have been a bit sceptical
about snake shows after sticky-beaking into
one where the chief demonstrator allowed
himself to be bitten to prove the efficacy of
a cure he was selling. The general opinion
seemed to be that he had become immune to
the venom. But the snakes had been judi-
ciously “milked" before being allowed to bite.
After a couple of bites on an instrument
used for the extraction and reception of the
venom, a snake’s poison-bag is exhausted.
Until the thing is refilled, which takes about
11 hours, it doesn't require much of an anti-
dote to cure the bite, provided the reptile’s
teeth are regularly cleaned and the victim
is healthy. A snake’s teeth can be cleaned
easily with antiseptic paste and a toothbrush,
the reptile being held just behind the head
and throat with thumb and finger. Then,
if the milking operation has been performed,
the bite that thrills the audience can be
cured with a dab of butter.
❖ * ❖ *
“Up North”: Among the sponge growths
rooted in the stony bottom of the sea are
the sea-whip and the fairy sea-tree. The sea-
whip grows to a length of 10 feet. It is
like a long, pliable rod, ebony-black in color,
its little bunch of roots clinging to a rock.
With a sudden kick the diver can detach it
PUTTING IN THE BOOT.
JACKY (to station owner): “By cripe, Boss, me belonga Jacky Lang now. Big feller
Communist. You gib it bacca, or we bin plurry well subdribide this feller
paddock.”
easily; but on the slightest touch its color
changes to grey ; then no strength can budge
it. The islanders occasionally turn these
whips into unique walking-sticks, and carve
ebony rings and bracelets out of them ; they
become very pliant when immersed in hot
water. The fairy-tree is a similar queer
growth, but is barely 18 inches high ; it is
a perfect tree in miniature with a wonderful
mass of branches. Forests of it grow to the
size of cocoanut-palms in different areas in
Torres Strait waters, and also on some bot-
toms off the New Guinea coast. One species
has great spreading branches and leaves
which shake with the movement of the tides
like the fine feathers on an emu’s tail.
The sea-bottom where these trees grow is
avoided by divers. Two .Taps pearl-shelling
off Dove Island had their lifelines fouled in
the branches and never came up again.
* * * *
“Mei”: The German who escaped with a
burnt tongue after eating cunjevoi (B.
8/9/’27) got off lightly. My neighbor had
working for him a new-clmm lad who, whilst
chipping weeds, hoed up the round brown
bulb of the cunjevoi and tasted it. His
tongue and throat not only gave him intense
pain, but swelled so alarmingly that we
were afraid he would suffocate. When once
more able to talk, he was asked why he had
tasted the bulb. “I thought it was a wild
cocoanut,” was the reply.
*'* * *
“H.V.E.”: The Australian bustard (“wild
turkey”) has long vanished from the grassy
hills of the far South Coast of New South
Wales. In earlier days this noble bird did
not stop on the wide plains of Monaro, where
it came to breed every summer, but swept
over the coast range on to the hills of the
Bega district below. It was, for instance,
then fairly common on the hills about Kam-
eruka, the late R. Tooth’s estate. In a few r
instances the bustard penetrated into the
open country bordering on the sea, but
even on the Monaro plains, where I have
counted 30 of the great birds in a flock, it
is now scarce. Rabbit poison and the fox,
which eats both eggs and young, have played
their part in the w r ork of extermination.
* * * *
“C. Coral”: Going through the bush to his
plantation-garden Oroki suddenly jumped two
feet into the air, and wmndered what new
kind of devil had come along the path to
greet him. Moving cautiously forward, he
investigated. “My word, I altogether fright
too much! he confided to me afterwards.
“Close up I finish die when I look that ting;
then I laugh big one! You know what f
find? Proper big carpet-snake; lie been start
kai-kai man-o’-war hawk (frigate bird) ; he
get them legs, head, body, inside his mouth
all right; but when he want to swill him
down them two big wings come open and lay
right across his mouth. When I find him,
only tail belong that carpet-snake; he move
all round, this way, that way; but them two
big wing make that snake look another kind!
My word!”
“M.L.C.”: The Fisheries Commissioners in
Southern Tasmania are still harping on the
destruction caused by tin' platypus. They
allege that he eats half his weight in fish in
a single night, and that as a result there is
not enough small fry available for the trout
to wax fat and hearty on. The platypus,
with his broad body, broad flat tail and short
legs, is ill-adapted by nature for speed, and
consequently appears to have as much chance
of catching the nimble small fry as a tor-
toise of catching a hare. Possibly he accounts
for a certain amount of ova, but there is
bound to be wastage in that direction. His
pelt is valuable, and were protection lifted
one of our most interesting and distinctive
types of fauna would soon be exterminated.
By the way, can any Abo. definitely state
what is the normal bill of fare of the platy-
pus V
* * * *
“Te Hipi”: Contrary to “Adah’s” Aus-
tralian experience (B. 8/9/’27). the skylark
has spread all over Maoriland. The birds
arc not numerous, like the sparrows and
starlings, but I haven’t been in any district
from which they were entirely absent. Their
habit of nesting on the ground tends to keep
their number down; stoats and weasels in
particular find them easy marks. Another
imported bird which has similar difficulties
is the sandpiper. These birds frequent river-
beds, preferably stony ones. Their nests may
he found among the stones or in the sand
alongside straggling tufts of grass, but are
extremely hard to locate. The eggs look
like small pebbles.
* * * *
“T T p North” : The Sauad was one of the
most highly valued ornaments in the Torres
Strait. It was an artificially deformed
boar’s-tusk, which met in a complete circle.
Hanging to the ivory were pigs’ tails, jet
black, washed and combed, with every hair
in place, making a striking ornament. On
the point of the tusk were carefully carved
lines, each line representing a different
woman won in love, by force or otherwise.
Only the headmen sported these sauad. They
were imported from New Guinea and it took
five skulls to buy one. Ingenious natives
carved imitations out of large shells, and
the wearers of these were regarded with
scorn by the proud possessors of the genuine
article.
(Continued on page 27.)
WE OF THE TILTED CART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
I’m camped by a gum-tree that bends o’er
the river;
Its bole marks the height where the last
flood had been;
Its shadows fall cool in the days of mid-
summer
Where grass and soft clover are waving
and green.
I’ve been round the sheds, in the West where
they’re shearing,
But a man on the track had no chance of
a start.
Gone past are the days of the old overlander.
The shearer who clings to his horses and
cart.
I never thought much of this new contract
shearing,
Each man for himself was the rule in
my day.
I m too old and stiff now to start as a
rousie
W here they roll up the wool in a new-
fangled way.
They sort it and tear it and class it and
dump it,
And the mode of its transport becomes a
fine art.
At the cut-out all hands went away in their
motors,
And left me alone in the old tilted cart.
I'm camped by the banks of the old Murrum-
bidgee,
And drowse in the shade, with an eye to
the lines,
While a breeze stirs the leaves of the tree-
tops above me
And brings from the sandhills the scent
of the pines.
As shades of the tall trees are stretching
and reaching
Con.'es the screech of galahs as they drink
and depart ;
I watch the sun set as the billy is boiling,
Then unroll my swag uii the floor of the
cart.
The night falls as dark as a tomb and as
silent;
There's no lowing of cattle or bleating of
sheep.
’There is peace in the bowl of the pipe I’ve
been smoking
Still warm in my hand as I drop off to
sleep.
“ON THE WATER WAGGON”
I wake with the first note of jackasses’
laughter
And magpies’ soft carolling gladdens the
heart
When the dew-laden air’s like a breath sent
from Heaven
That moistens the flap and the tilt of the
cart.
I court not the smile of the fickle Dame For-
tune.
There’s tea in the hilly and grass in the
bend ;
I crave not the pomp of the scats of the
mighty,
The man with the swag on his back is my
friend.
I’m almost the last of a type that is passing
That follows no road map and studies no
chart;
The cart is nvy home and the bush is my
lover—
I first saw the light ’ncath the tilt of a
cart.

“Jimmy Possum”: It doesn’t do to get
too close to a mauled goanna. Sick of see-
ing my dog trying to make an out-sized
fowlliouse-raider take the count, I brought
the iron-shod heel of my blucher down
solidly on the scavenger’s napper. The
unthankful brute kicked up and grabbed me
round the shin with his hack pedals. The
capers I cut trying to dislodge the gripping
demon would have shamed a two-year-old
colt with a brace of spitting tom-cats hung
across his loins. When I found that I
couldn’t kick nor buck myself free, I tried to
tear away the hugging horror, but the more
I tugged and twisted the deeper into ray
tender skin went his toenails. Writhing
in pain I stood helplessly looking down at
my torturer, who seemed to have collared me
for keeps. Then before I knew it the strain-
ing muscles were relaxed, and the go. lay
gasping at my feet. I left Bluey to finish
the work he had commenced.

“Larrapinta”: In the big basin called
Dalhousie Springs, Central Australia, are
permanent creeks and big pools, all fed by
springs. In some of the waterholes are
shoals of a fish which exists nowhere else
in Australia. When fully grown it is about
eight inches in length, and it resembles an
English trout, inasmuch as it has a dark-
green back, a silvery belly and red-spotted
sides. It bites readily, and is quite as good
eating as trout. The only name it possesses
is “gooya,” bestowed on it by the local
branch of the once great Arunta tribe.
* * * *
“Saaedi”: The domestic troubles of birds
are amusingly similar to those of humans.
The other day I saw a pair of doves billing
and cooing on the branch of a tree. Along
came a big, bustling male bird who chased
the husband away. The intruder tried to
make his suit good with the lady, but she
would have none of him. When he edged
unpleasantly near she moved away. Presently,
from a near-by tree, whence she had evi-
dently been watching the whole proceedings,
came Don Juan’s wife. She brought no
private detective in her train, hut was
herself equal to the situation, and her sadly-
chastened and badly-damaged husband soon
flew meekly away. Then the temporarily-
dispossessed husband returned, and the bill-
ing and cooing commenced afresh.

“Gouger”: A closely-guarded secret among
the northern Cape York Peninsula natives is
the initiation rites of youths at the circum-
cision ceremony. I know one white man
only who has witnessed these rites, and he
has been brought up amongst the blacks from
babyhood, had been admitted into their blood
brotherhood, and initiated into all but the
innermost mysteries of their secret society.
No woman or child dare, on pain of death,
venture near the sacred grove where the
neophytes are isolated. They are kept there
naked a fortnight, are starved and all awed
but one drink of water per day. Shadowy
councillors, appearing noiselessly for a few
moments only, guard the youths, who are
terrorised at night by blood-curdling shrieks
coming unexpectedly from the greenery en-
compassing them. They are put through
rites, each with a definite objective, to imbue
them with bravery, cunning and. agility.
Each rite is based mainly on terrorism, and
each is of increasing severity. After re-
covery from the operation they are blind-
folded and brought back to camp, there to
witness the dance which admits them to
manhood and the right to a wife. The witch-
doctor is the brains and star actor in this
ceremonial, and sports a dress I have never
heard of as having been used by southern
tribes. It is carved from the heart of a
large softwood tree. A huge hollow mask
fits over the head and body to the thighs.
The face is grotesquely carved and painted.
The limbs are hidden by tufts of sword-
grass, and the joints picked out with feath-
ery sheaves. Shells and bands of human
bone clink upon the arms. At the psycho-
logical moment he bounds out of the. darkness
into the square of dancing warriors, and
is greeted by the howls of men and shrieks
of women.

“Lagani-Namo” : Now that furs and snake-
skins are fashionable, good opportunities
await enterprising young hunters almost
anywhere in New Guinea. Though the furs
of marsupials in the country along the
coast are sparse, short and more or less
coarse, there are cuscus (a species of
opossum), speckled squirrels, smoky-blue
rats and other furred creatures in consider-
able numbers. In the high ranges there are
two varieties of tree-climbing kangaroo. As
a rule the furs improve in quality with alti-
tude. The climbing Too is rich bright-brown
in color tipped with gleams of gold that
flash when the sunlight catches them. The
natives are clever hunters, but careless
taxidermists. A patient teacher with the
faculty of handling men should find the fur-
liunting enterprise worth while.
* * * *
“Bisley”: Toas or direction-finders are in
use among the abos. in the Lake Eyre dis-
trict, Centralia. They take the form of a
stick about six inches along, with an oblong
knob or mould of mud (or clay) attached to
one end. Into this sticks are stuck, and,
according to the type of wood used and the
color of the rings that circle the clay, absent
members of the tribe on returning know
where to find their friends. The ton is
placed in such a position that the knobby
end points in the direction that the tribe
lias taken, and the sticks and rings are fur-
ther clues. Should the tribe be diverted
from its course, another ton is left at the
point where it turned off. and symbols are
affixed to the clay end to indicate the locality
in which it is likely to be found.

“See ’em! Why, I had to take out ’ankercher, I could smell 'em so.”
“ J.D.C.” : The other day a gecko, or pine-
adder, put up a stunt which leaves me
puzzled. He was on the ceiling upside down,
stalking a small grey moth. Very slowly he
slid towards his prey until they were only
about five, inches apart; then gecko jumped,
and grabbed. Novv how the deuce did he
land back? According t<> the law of gravita-
tion. having left: the ceiling he should have

“Matakitaki” : I can
support “Pfella" (B.
l/9/’27) in his state-
ment about the useful-
ness of the spinifex-
hush as a bed, but, it
must be used with
caution and only big
bushes employed. We
were out. shooting on
the Westralian gold-
fields, and when night
came one of the party,
having heard of the
comfort of a spinifex
bed, decided to try it.
We warned him that
the bushes at our camp
were too small and
would turn over, but
he thought he knew
better and made his
bed. About two hours
later we were awak-
ened by agonised
howls. The novice
spent the first two
hours of daylight lying
face down to the
ground while two
others removed the
hard spinifex spines
from his anatomy with tweezers.

“Toby 0.”: All kinds of tripe hounds, save
the petted toys of the luxurious, find greater
favor in out-baca parts since the high price
of furred skins has given an impetus to the
hunting business. Our Northern Tableland
(N S.W.) district will treasure the memory ot
a wedding-breakfast speech delivered by a
bridegroom who had been presented with a
kangaroo-dog pup. “T’ tell yer the truth,
he said, laving a heavy hand on the, shoulder
of his bride. “I’m blowed if I know w ich o

“Kooragai” : Bolger hated _crows, mainly
because they stole the eggs laid in the grass
around his homestead. He caught three m
a wire-netting trap set over a dead sheep,
then did some transformation work on them.
One was dyed a beautiful vermilion, an-
other Avas streaked in half a dozen startling
colors and bejewelled with a tiny bell; and
the third was painted white. When they
were thoroughly dry, the three gay thieves
were liberated. So far as Bolger knows they
are still trying to catch up to their old
friends to explain the new fashion, for he
hasn't; seen any crows since.

“Kriz” : Among a collection of odds and
ends pulled out of a red handkerchief by an
abo. down in Perth for the nor -west police
trial was a pindie-pindie. an ornament stick
made to represent a feather. It. is in great
demand by the gins to adorn their hair. The
effect is produced by scraping down the green
part of a young branch a couple of inches till
it frills, then further scraping the inner part
till it frills over the outer. When looked at
from a distance, a few hours after having been
made, the green and cream “feather” bears
the appearance of having been dipped in two
paint-pots.
* * *
“X2X” : A white kangaroo recently turned
up on Nebea station, near Goonamble
(N.S.W.), where it still is, every effort to
capture it having been unsuccessful. It is
apparently full-grown, and in color a pure
white, without, so far as can be ascertained,
the intrusion of any admixture. The exist-
ence of other white kangaroos has been re-
ported from time to time, and several alleged
to be white have been shot, but in each
instance they have been of a light grey color.
The Coonamble Too is stated to be the second
of its kind, the first being in Sydney Museum.

"Wang”: Is it possible for a horse to die
of a broken heart? Our local ranger tells
me that one day recently he picked up a
couple of horses wandering about the roads,
and impounded them. One was a thorough-
bred, got by Comedy King; the other an
old black mare of no account. The owner
released the blue-blooded stray, but would
not bother about the mare, as she was more
a nuisance than of worth. She seemed able
to force her way out of any paddock she
was placed in. and always coaxed the other
neddy away with her. “That old mare,”
the ranger told me, “went on at an awful
rate when her mate was taken away. She
absolutely cried like a child, the tears
running down her face. Next morning when
I went to the pound-yard she was lying
dead as a doornail. It wasn’t starvation, as
she was in good nick, and she hadn’t hurt
herself in any way. I’m satisfied she died
of a broken heart, grieving after the other
moke.”

with the new Model 56 WINCHESTER Bolt-action, .22 calibre rifle,
because all the refinements of the highest-grade special target arms are
built into its barrel and action. The magazine, which is curved in shape and of
entirely new design, brings each of its five .22 Long-Rifle cartridges exactly into line with the
breech when the bolt is pulled back. Double Extractors grip the rim of the shell as it rises from
the magazine, and holding it firmly feed it in a perfectlp straight line into the close-fitting
chamber.
When the breech is closed the Bullet is seated right into the grooves of the rifling, ready to
take its spinning flight the instant the trigger is pressed. This means that there is no pre-
liminary “jump” as it leaves the mouth of the shell, and the bore being completely sealed, every
ounce of pressure is exerted against the base of the bullet. The result is superb accuracy, and
the full energy of the particular cartridge used.
These Special Features Are Found in No Other .22 Sporting Rifle.

DECLINING WHEAT YIELDS.
“L’Fou”: Concerning “J.G.’s” wail (B
22/9/’27) about the wheat that will not
thrive on land where once it did well. It
seems to be a common error to regard a
soil and its make-up as permanent. Usually
the cultivator of virgin soil is drawing on
capital rather than income. The farmer’s
common expression of “run-down” or
“worked-out” soil is a vague truth ; an over-
draft has been made on the top stratum.
Probably the depletion could be made good
by scientific manuring, but that may not be
commercially practicable. It may be only
one element of the dozen or more essential
plant constituents which is lacking. But its
scarcity (or absence) may render others
unavailable. The addition of one needed ele-
ment (lime, for instance) may cause the
natural supply of other elements to be con-
sumed at a hitherto impossible rate. Hence
the common saying about some fertilisers,
that “they make the farmer rich but his heirs
poor.”
Pioneer methods of farming undoubtedly
took the cream from much of our land.
It is up to us to use brains on the skim-
inilk of it.
Wheat, of course, is an aristocrat among
cereals. Oats, barley, and other crops will
continue to thrive on land long after the
rather temperamental King Wheat has
turned it down.
W.A.’s WHEAT YIELD.
“Sandplain”: W.A.’s annual increase of
five million bushels of wheat is likely to be
more than maintained this season, when the
total production will not fall far short of
40 million bushels. This is the more remark-
able when it is remembered that the average
yield per acre is as low as 94 bushels,
which expert Sutton, of the Agricultural
Department, is doing his utmost to raise
by advocating more intense fallowing and a
system of rotation of crops to conserve the
fertility of the soil. The Canadian farmer
gets an average yield of nearly twice that of
the W.A. cocky, but the average price per
bushel realised by W.A. wheat last season
was ss. 8 Ul. as compared with the Canadian’s
4s. 7d. The weakest point, however, in the
W.A. position is that, whereas the Canadian
grows his wheat without any artificial
manure, superphosphate—and plenty of it —
is required in W.A.
EXPERIMENT FARMS.
“Max”: The scheme of experiment farms
outlined by “Jack Point” (B. (5/10/’27) has
been a feature of the N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture for over 30 years. The chain of
farms possessed by the department, the care-
ful experiments under expert direction, and
the freely-a vail able reports of all their work
have been of the greatest assistance to the
man on the land in N.S.W., whatever his
branch of farming. To mention a few of
such places, there are Plawkesbury Agricul-
tural College and its various farms, and the
Experiment Farms at Yanco, Wagga, Cowra,
Wollongbar, Grafton, Bathurst and Glen
Inncs, and the viticultural nursery at
Narara; also the large Government Poultry
Farm at Seven Hills, near Sydney, and the
stud piggeries at numbers of the mental
hospitals. Well-bred animals, fowls, turkeys,
tested queen-bees and pure seeds may be
purchased from the department. Informa-
tion on any possible variety of farming
is freely offered by the department, leaflets
and bulletins are supplied gratis for the
asking, large handbooks are sold at ridicu-
lously low prices, and men are encouraged
to visit experiment farms and seek infor-
mation. Advice is also given regarding
prices and markets; and the Agricultural
Gazette of N.S.W.. a most attractive and
sound monthly publication, is supplied free
to genuine farmers whether small or large.
SHEEP AMONG WHEAT.
“C.C.”: “Tritici” (B. 25/8/’27) advises
turning sheep into wheat when it is wet.
It is not sound advice. If sheep are turned
on to wet (‘rop there is a very grave danger
of them getting bloated and pegging out,
and it is most injurious to the wheat.
The best time to feed off wheat is when
the plant is about four inches high and when
the land is fairly dry or quite dry —never
when it is wet. Also, the quicker the plant
is nipped back the better. Get the mob
of jumbucks to do the work like a mowing
machine, if possible, and never feed off twice.
Feeding off in wet weather the land gets
pugged and then sets hard. The plant bogged
into the ground gets bruised and suckers
weakly, and the bruised stems are often
attacked by the germ that causes the heads
to turn white 1 —commonly known amongst
cockies as “white heads.” Experiments)
tried with eating off and not eating off have
invariably favored the latter method. Bet-
tor by far to know your particular variety
of wheat, and sow in its particular season.
It is better to sow an early maturing variety
early than to try to correct its growth by
feeding off.
Of course, in a lush season feeding off has
to be resorted to sometimes, but watch the
weather. Eat off only when the weather is
fine, and shift the sheep if it starts to rain.
CORN-HUSKS AS FODDER.
“Walkabout”: “Matrix” (B. l/9/’27)
speaks of Ivillarney (S.Q.) farmers giving
corn-husks a trial as sheep fodder. In the
’nineties and the early part of this century
corn-husks were a regular part of the milk-
ing-cow’s ration at Pine River, and it was
regarded as equal to any other feed. The.
farmer and his . family used to husk for an
hour after supper and give the husks out
straight away. I also knew a German set-
tler who used to chaff the husks up for horse
feed with good results,
AUSTRALIAN MERINO PURITY.
“675”: “FY7” (B. 29/9/’27) reminds me
of a discussion I had with Professor Barker
as far back as 1909 on the subject of the
purity of certain Australian types of merino,
when 1 was astounded at his suggestion that
some of our. leading Australian, flocks were
not absolutely pure bred. Since then, with this
discussion in mind, I have spoken on the sub-
ject to many men of wide and long experience,
and am satisfied, from what they have told me,
aided by my own study of the sheep and
the wools, that the Border Leicester, at a
period of between 50 and 40 years ago, was
used in one of our principal types to obtain
certain desirable qualities.
It is remarkable how sheep will continue
to throw back to such a strain. A couple
of years ago I was classing a Queensland
clip on a station which had formerly run
crossbreds and comebacks, but had used none
but pure merino rams for not less than !2
generations. Yet I obtained an odd 36’s
quality fleece, some 40’s, 46’s. 50's and
several bales of 56’s, and had to delegate a
piecepicker to look after the crossbred wool
coming through. About 24 per cent, of that
clip was crossbred in quality and character,
and that in a climate peculiarly suitable
to the production and development of merino
wool. At the moment I am faced with a
similar “problem clip,” which slieep-classers
have endeavored for some years to breed
back to merino and which at least one of
them has given up in disgust.
We certainly must beware of losing our
eminent position as merino-wool producers,
though that position remains reasonably
secure while some of our great studs which
are above suspicion remain. While they
exist we can, at the worst, always build
up again.
“STAR” LOTS OF WOOL.
“(»75’’_: I can assure “L. Y. llemos” (B:
29/9/27) that his experience with “star”
lots of wool is not likely to be repeated in
these days. Stars and bag lots have proved
goldmines to many, but others have now
tumbled to their possibilities, and there is
good competition in these lines. Moreover,
the period "L. V. Remos” speaks of (the
very early days of the war) was one of the
worst in the trade, when, the smaller specu-
lators found finance impossible to arrange,
and when no one could forecast wool values.
The small man was then the backbone of the
butt and bag market. Nowadays bigger
repacking firms handle much of this trade.
The small farmer, especially the 3- to 500-
sheep man. is well advised by “Trepex” in
the same issue. Buy even lines of sheep.
Better for the get-up of the wool, better for
breeding, better for selling when fat. When
handling the wool, skirt only the heavy burr
and bellies from the fleeces and put these
together.
Some advocate sending these very small
clips to be repacked by certain firms who
bulk such small clips together and so sell
? !1 big lots. While this may recommend
itself in theory, in practice the disadvantages
outweigh the advantages obtained, and the
expense concerned is only one of the
disadvantages. Many wools, for instance,
do not lend themselves to the process,. aud
the result is an obviously second-hand parcel,
which is never a recommendation. Only in
the case of such hopeless mixtures as cross-
breds and merino should it be resorted to.
By far the best plan is to buy an even line
of station-bred sheep.
SHEEP MOTORISTS.
"G.G.G”: In spite of one notable failure
it is evident that large-scale transfers of
Starving sheep in motor-lorries have been
a decided success during the big drought
that seems to be drawing to an end in
Queensland. W. A. Russell, a Queensland
pastoralist and M.L.A., told the northern
Parliament recently that he had made several
successful shifts of the sort, the latest being
the transfer of 7000 sheep from Listowel
Downs in the upper Barcoo country to Cun-
namulla. a distance, roughly, of over 150
miles. The cost of transport was about Is.
per head, and losses only 3 per cent. The
chief ingredient to win success in these ven-
tures seems to be the starting off of the
sheep for their new quarters before their
condition gets so low that they arc unable to
stand the strain of travel in the lorries,
while stages should be as short as conveni-
ently possible. In the failure above referred
to, when an attempt was made to transfer
the mob from near Bedourie, in s.-w. Queens-
land, to the Win ton district, some 200 miles,
the sheep were dog-poor and weak, and an
attempt w r as made to cover the trying journey
at top speed over rough roads in a single
stage.
AGAINST WOOL POOLING.
“Pick’’ : Too many obstacles stand in the
way of successfully arranging a pool and
interclassing the wool of small breeders. In
no district can there be found a near uni-
formity of wool values, and no breeder of
a constantly improved class of sheep could
be expected to mix his wool with that of
careless men who never cull their mobs. Any-
how. to the wool-grower who regularly
obtains a near-top price for his fleeces,
where is the advantage to be gained by pool-
ing, with all its attendant difficulties? On
the Bibbenluke Closer Settlement Area,
N.S.W., the majority of the small breeders
go near to topping the season's market. How
would pooling benefit them? And Tom
Daniel, at Ingledow, N.S.W., with GOO sheep,
regularly betters the price obtained for the
wool of the adjacent squattages, Foxlow,
Carwoola and Gidleigh. What need has he
to pool with the less enterprising growers
around him?
DESCRIBING WOOL.
“R. E. Combing” : It would be impossible
to impose, a uniform stystem of marking
for the various classes of wool, and it is
not very important either, as the buyers
buy the wool, not the brands; but a man
makes a mistake if he flies contrary to
general usage in the matter. It is the
usual custom for a man to call the best, of
his wool AAA’s, the next best AA’s and so
on. Those who adopt some other system,
or reverse the order, expose themselves to
the risk of their intentions being misunder-
stood. Those who are handling the wool
soon see through the variation, but the work
of buyer and broker is hindered. And it
isn’t usually the men with the good wool
who adopt original notions.
UNPROFITABLE DAIRY-FARMING.
“Te Hipi”: The Maorilaml Government
has just completed a survey of 35 dairy-
farms in the Piako district, one of the finest
in the Dominion. The farms surveyed in-
cluded those of the Manuwaru group of the
N.Z. Herdtesting Association, which group
produced an average of 3001 b. of butter-fat
..per cow last season. The average for the
whole of the 35 farms was 2911 b. per cow, so
there was nothing the matter with produc-
tion. But all the farms showed a com-
paratively small profit, ranging from £G7 to
£2BO.
For the sake of uniformity interest on land
and stock at Government valuation, which
would be conservative, was assessed at 6 per
cent.: cost of milking each cow was esti-
mated at £7, and butter-fat was valued at
Is. 4d. per lb., which turned out to be very
close to the price actually realised.
The production cost of butter-fat was found
to be from 13.3 d. to 16.5 d. per lb., showing
an actual loss in some cases. This was
turned into a small profit by the rearing of
pigs. All the farmers top-dressed a portion
of their farms; indeed, more than a third of
them top-dressed the whole of their farms
annually.
The survey indicates that the great
majority of Maoriland dairy-farmers are pro-
ducing at a loss; that is, if fair interest and
labor charges are allowed. The Dominion
average production per cow is under 2001 b.,
so that if a group of farms as favorably
situated as those tested could make only a
bare profit, what must be the loss sustained
by the whole of the industry? No wonder
the wages and conditions of workers on
dairy-farms are notoriously poor.
A GOOD WORD FOR THE JERSEY.
"Old Timer”: Where (lid "Almanac” (B.
G/10/’27) get the idea that Jersey beef
lias orange-colored fat? The orange color
is noticeable in any fat beast that is rapidly
going off condition by being half starved for
a few weeks. The Jersey’s hide is thin and
lighter than other breeds, but as a cream and
butter cow it will do. me, and I have had
a lifetime amongst them. This drought has
shown new hands that the Jersey stands dry
weather the best. There isn't so much of her
to feed, and she’ll eat anything from gum
leaves to “stinkers.”
POINTS OF THE CLYDESDALE.
“Glenfield”: These are the points that
should be looked for in buying a Clydesdale
liorse:—
The head should be on the small side, not
large, long or coarse, yet masculine in appear-
ance, full and wide between the eyes, and
slightly tapering to the roots of the ear;
the ears should not be too close at the base,
nor too long, thick or heavy, but active and
inclined forward and inward at the points,
and not set too far back.
The eye should be full, but mild and placid
and not showing over-much white.
The jaws ought to be deep and broad at
the gullet, tlu' muzzle not too heavy or too
pointed, the lips neither thick nor large.
The head should be firmly set on a neck of
medium length, strong and massive, well
arched and firm, and having a lengthy silken
mane tapering evenly back to the top of the
shoulders.
The shoulders should be well packed, deep
and oblique, narrow at the top and not
thick and heavy.
The chest should be wide, low and full,
with strong wide forearms having plenty of
good muscle down to the knees; the knees
should be broad, hard. Hat and cvenjoiuted,
not round and fleshy with joints at the out-
side.
The cannon bone must not be too long,
but round and even in front, without any
front ridge, broad from a side view, tapering
back like a wide-bladed razor, full and large
at the lower end to allow plenty of play at
the fetlock. The splint bones and sinews of
the legs should be strong and hard, close
together and fairly well back from the bones.
A soft round bone is very undesirable in the
leg of any horse.
The pasterns should be of medium size and
moderately sloped, elastic and springy, not
short, straight and stuffy.
Among the many things to be avoided are
ringbone, sidebone, any sign of grease, spavin
or tendency towards founder.
Thu back should be moderately short, but
wide and strong in the couplings, with wide,
strong, roomy, deep flank ribs.
The quarters must be strong, wide and
even from the coupling back to the root of
the tail, which should not rise too high nor
slope away too suddenly. The thighs should
be broad and muscular, tapering to the hocks,
which should be slightly bent, but broad,
muscular and firm, without any flesh curbs
or flabbiness; below, the hock should be
short, broad, strong, clean, flat and straight,
with a forward incline; the sinews should
be strong and stand well out from the bone,
even and firm.
The hind pastern should be a little larger
than the front one, and a little more inclined.
The hair on the legs should be fairly long,
soft and silky, flowing well to the back, and
not in front as we often see it; the hair
should come well above the back of the knee
on the front legs.
On the hind legs it should terminate at
the first or lower joint below the hocks.
The legs should stand evenly and the
hind ones a little wider apart than the front
pair; and they must not turn out when walk-
ing or trotting.
A well-balanced horse with evenly set legs
has body and legs in unison, whether standing
or in motion : its carriage and action give the
impression of harmony.
DISTEMPER.
“Azac”: With shearing in full swing many
sheepdogs are down with distemper. The
disease is prevalent in western N. S. Wales,
where foxes also are affected. Distemper is a
virus disease caused by a germ too small 10
be seen even under the most powerful micro-
scope. Young dogs are most susceptible to
it. The disease generally makes its appear-
ance in the late winter or early spring, when
weather conditions favor development of the
germ. If a dog has been indifferently cared
for and then run off its legs during mus-
tering. it is pounds to peanuts it will con-
tract distemper if the germ is about the dis-
trict. Troper care of the dog is the best safe-
guard. House him in sanitary quarters and
feed him regularly twice daily (mainly on
meat), and the chances of him going down
to any disease will be remote.
There are different kinds of distemper,
but the one most commonly met with in
N.S.W. is much like influenza in the human.
The dog turns down his tucker, becomes
feverish and dull, coughs occasionally, and

In Dublin’s fair city
where the girls are so pretty”
IRISHMEN the world over have woven a halo of romance
around Dublin. Poets have delighted to sing, of the queen
city of the Emerald Isle —and the mere mention of “dear
ould Dublin” is sufficient to brin& a li&ht to the eye and a
panegyric to the tongue of every son of old Ireland.
The faith of the son of Erin in the excellence of everything
which is of Dublin origin is further enhanced by the con-
sistent superiority of a famous Dub-
lin product - John Jameson Whiskey.
For at the Bow Street Distillery,
Dublin, “JJ.” Whiskey has been
distilled since 1780, and the same
distinctive qualities which brought
it into immediate popularity account
for its continued preference by
sound judges of whiskey after a
lapse of nearly 150 years.

has discharges from the eyes and nose. A
later development is St. Vitus’s dance anu
paralysis of the hind legs. There seems to be
no specific medicinal remedy and vaccines are
not to be relied upon. Most sheepmen resort to
the old “cure” of filing a penny on to a piece
of bread and dripping and giving that to the
dog. I have never met anyone who coula
explain what benefit the dog derives from
the copper filings, and the Australian sheep-
dog must be a marvel to survive such
treatment.
Vets, are wary of prescribing drugs, believ-
ing that the dog will usually pull through
if cleanly and snugly housed and propeny
fed and cared for. Have the kennel disin-
fected often, supply plenty of fresh water,
and coax the dog to eat lightly-boiled lean
meat that has been well cut up.
The wise sheepman ties liis dog up at
saleyards, for in such places strange dogs
are met with, and distemper is contagious.
CULLING COCKERELS.
“Jack Point”: What should we look for
in young cockerels that are kept with a view
to next season’s breeding? Firstly, discard
those that show an early growth of comb
which denotes the too-early maturing of the
reproductive organs. Those backward in
growth, also, are not worth keeping—it is
the happy medium sorts to which we must
pin our faith. They should show good type,
be well boned and not squirrel- or wry-
tailed. The eye is a good guide, too—it
should be very bright and full of life, with
not the slightest sign of a droop in the lid.
Plenty of vigor and life should also he pre-
sent, but very wild sorts seldom make good
sires. After you have fined down your selec-
tion to, say, double the number required,
study the pedigrees and make your final
choice. If you haven’t got the pedigree back
for three generations, take steps so that
you will have it in future years. It is highly
desirable that the actual record of all
females’ first laying year be known, but in
cases where this is impracticable the farmer
should make a point of breeding specially
from those hens which he knows from obser-
vation are his best layers. If this policy is
persisted in year after year, the advantages
will become so obvious that trap-nesting and
single-pen testing and pedigree breeding will
become the regular thing, and the poultry,
which were once considered a small side-line
to be looked after by the missus and kids,
will come into their own.
STARTING POULTRY FARMING.
“Jack Point” : Hundreds of town workers
have become successful poultry farmers by
just doing things gradually, keeping on at
their town jobs and getting a bit of land
some way out of the city. All that is
required is about half an acre of land,
although if more can be obtained it is very
handy for keeping a cow or two —they are
almost worth their weight in gold on a
chook farm. The best way to start is by
buying, say, 100 day-old chicks from one of
the successful breeders. These are reared
for the first six or eight weeks in the
brooder house, cold brooders being almost
universally used nowadays, after which they
are passed in to the growing house, which
is provided with as large a run as can be
spared, the pullets being separated from the
cockerels. These latter should be sent to
market as soon as distinguishable, as it is
a losing proposition to rear them further.
When the pullets are five months old they
are drafted into the large laying house,
which should be run on the intensive sys-
tem—the birds confined all the time and a
litter of straw or bracken placed about Din.
deep on the floor in which the grain is fed.
The scratching in this litter all day pro-
vides the hens with all the exercise they
require, the eggs arc kept clean, and the
hens keep on laying whether the weather
is wet or fine. This is very important, as
hens in bare yards just mope around when
it rains and go right off the lay. Laying
houses should be large, housing anything up
to 500 birds. The correct space to allow is
4 sq. feet per bird, and 7in. of roost.
The poultryman of this type who keeps
in touch with the latest ideas in feeding,
breeding and so forth often develops into a
breeder of first-class stock. There is plenty
of room for small men in the poultry
industry, and egg-export to England offers
great possibilities. We are in the fortunate
position of having our season of plenty just
when the English market is at its highest
owing to the winter shortage in Europe.
Australia supplies about 5 per cent, of the
U.K.’s egg imports, but there’s no reason
why we shouldn’t make the figure 50 per
cent.
RATIONS FOR POULTRY.
“C.A.” : After a good deal of experiment-
ing I have found the following to be the
best-balanced ration for the production of
eggs from all breeds of fowls: The morning
mash, three parts pollard and one of bran,
with a little salt, mixed warm, should be
left with the fowls for from 20 to ‘lO
minutes. About noon some choppcd-up green
food, lucerne for preference, should be given.
About 6 p.m. feed as much wheat, or in
winter equal parts of wheat and maize, as
the chooks will eat. There should be a
plentiful supply of clean water kept in a
cool and shady place, with a box of broken
crocks, old mortar, or, for preference, oyster-
shell grit, permanently at hand.
FOUL BROOD.
“Pick”: The methods recommended by
“Larrapinta” (B. 22/9/’27) for the eradica-
tion of foul brood from a beehive might, in
some cases, prove effectual, but the disease
from the infected bees would be almost cer-
tain to impregnate the new combs he would
allow them to build, and there would be
danger of the infection of adjacent hives.
The appearance of foul brood is readily de-
tectable by the sunken cap and small hole of
the brood' cells. If further confirmation b:>
required, insert into the suspected cell the
point of a needle and withdraw slowly. A
stringy brown substance stretching back
from the needle will positively establish the
presence of the disease. To save the whole
apiary, my advice is to bag up the affected
hive at night, when all the bees are home,
and dump it into a furnace. That s the
only sure remedy yet discovered.
PINEAPPLE GROWING IN NORTHERN
NEW SOUTH WALES.
“Cog”: Now that regulations have been
issued that deserted “bunchy-top” banana
plantations must be dug out and destroyed,
it will pay the owners of such areas to give
pineapples a trial. Pineapples dc not require
soil of the same quality as bananas, and it
has been found on the lower north coast of
Queensland that they do excellently on land
that has previously been under bananas.
A climate suited to bananas is suited to
pines; in fact pines will stand a cold spell
better. A return of Bs. or 9s. a case on
the Sydney market will pay N.S.AV. growers
handsomely, and the price seldom goes lower
than that. If intermediate pines can be
grown—they seem to come when the winter is
slightly cooler —prices will go as high as
30s. and will average close to 20s. a case.
Between now and Christmas is the ideal
time for planting. Plant suckers, for pre-
ference, in double rows 9iu. apart, with
9ft. between each double row and 12in.
between each plant. Each plant should
be set so that it is midway between two
others in the twin row.
If horse work can be done, plant tin*
rows across slopes to save wash. Otherwise,
up and down, but too steep a slope is not
recommended.
Suckers can be had from Queensland 1
gardens at £2 10s. per 1000, but make sure
you get them from a plantation that is not
overrun with red Natal grass, otherwise
you will bring the seed with the suckers,
and red Natal is an abomination in a pin;-
apple plantation. Cayenne Queen is a reli-
able variety for N.S.W. districts.
SHEEP-DOGS AND TICKS.
“Jim Domino”: “Anthony Gloster” (B.
29/9/’27) gives a kindly thought to Fido
re dipping, after the sheep have been treated.
But dipping doesn’t kill the ticks which
adhere to dogs around Winton (C.Q.). I
have dipped dogs, washed them in kerosene
and rubbed oil and mutton-fat into their
hides to no avail. The only way I eased
their agony was to sit down with tweezers
and pick the blood-suckers out one by one.
They attack the ribs, flanks, head and tail,
and lodge between the toes, and deep inside
the ears.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Hoki Mut”: When yarding ewes and
lambs hessian wings are the one sure bet.
Buy 20 yards of 4ft. hessian and divide into
double lengths ; with these at hand and your
mob within striking distance of the yards,
retire all dogs (even the quiet workers) and
any maniacs with stockwhips and tin-kettles
to a safe position. Then, supported by all
hands, the hessian wings are used in a care-
ful encircling movement, with the yard
entrance as the objective. A clean marking
can thus be guaranteed.
“Taparap” : A very effective cure for girth-
gall and sore shoulders can be made as fol-
lows : Mix 2oz. white lead and loz. of boracic
acid into a smooth paste with olive-oil. If
this ointment is applied night and morning
the worst cases will heal up very quickly.
“Country Ped.” : Some advice from an old
drover: If your dog gets dust in his throat
during a dry, dusty stage, give him a spoon-
ful of vaseline three times a day. It is a
quick and sure cure. Never allow yoiir dog
to become sore-footed. At the least sign of
this trouble use castor-oil. Fill a circular
2oz. tobacco tin with the oil and dip the
dog’s feet in, seeing that the toes are well
covered. The dust will adhere to the pads
then and so protect that part of the foot,
while the oil prevents cracks in the joints.
“C.C.”: This year wheat sown on land
which was in need of rain was considerably
helped if the land was rolled. The writer
had fallowed land sown, and after the seed
germinated and the plant was about four
inches high, rolled the land. The result was
astonishing, the wheat on this land having
the appearance at the present time of giving
a yield of at least two bags to the acre more
than land not rolled.
“Sucre”: Millions of corncobs, with their
yellow fangs drawn, are thrown away every
harvest. Dipped in kerosene they make good
kindling, and put through the chaffcutter
and sprayed with molasses the mixture is a
fine pig-fattener.
“A. 8.”: Tip a load of old mortar into the
corner of the fowl-run and there will be no
trouble with soft-shelled eggs. It is useless
to expect sound eggs where the runs are bare
of grit and grass.
“X.L.”: To effectively shift ants —especi-
ally the variety which build mounds near
country houses —cover the domes with a bag
saturated with sugar and carbolic disinfec-
tant (or sheep-dip). The method has no
attraction for pets or stock —unlike other
poisonous devices.
“C.C.”: A simple way of stimulating
growth of vegetables of the pumpkin-melon
class is to use a tin of water and a length
of wool. Insert one end of the wool into
the hollow stem of the selected vegetable
and drop the other into the water. Shade the
tin and keep it replenished. Tomatoes will
also respond wonderfully.
“Caballer”: A useful kerosene-tin handle
can be made with 15 inches or so of old
rubber piping from the spray pump. Slip a
piece of thick, plain wire through it and
book the ends of the wire into the tin in
the ordinary way. It is best to have the
rubber the full length of the handle, as a
short piece, though long enough for a grip,
is apt to slip about.
“Harrv Stottle” : A cocky along the War-
ragul-road (Vic.) has solved the gate-open-
ing problem by building a sort of bridge over
his fence. It consists of wooden gutters
which accommodate Lizzie’s wheels nicely,
so that she can be rushed up and over. The
device is stockproof.
“Cuehulain”: Now that the cochineal
insect has proved its worth as a destroyer
of prickly-pear (it’s a slow worker but very
sure), it looks as if it will bo wiped out by
an unforeseen enemy. Round Warwick (Q.)
especially the cattle have developed a taste
for the cochineal insects’ eggs—in fact, the
beasts make a point of only devouring the
cactus on which eggs renose, and millions <>f
the busy little insects disappear in a single
gulp!

Dark as night or queenly fair,
Born to dazzle and entrance
When she flashes, meteor-wise,
By the hero’s ravished eyes!
Languishing in garret drear,
Or of princely forbears sprung,
Be she rich or be she poor
Lovely, ingenue and young,
Never heroine has been
Any more than just nineteen!
While the hero, man of steel,
Arab Sheik or Oxford Blue,
King or cowboy, never stood
Any less than six foot two!
Yet the grandest man alive
Barely touches five foot five !
I am freckled, with a nose
Frankly snub that tends toward
Heaven,
Got no manner, looks or style;
Monday week I’m twenty-seven;
Neither wealthy, fair nor wise—
Till I look in Someone’s eyes!
Honest eyes of homely .green
(Never flash or glint or glare
Like the hero’s),, where I see
Me, transformed, reflected there.
Then I know myself a queen,
Lovely, rich and just nineteen.

up, but had made him Pay dearly. What-
ever he did he was blamed for it.
Certainly he had his faults. He was not
lazy. He did not hate work, but there were
so many other things to do. He loved to
roam the woods and climb the hills. But
instead Mr. Sandpaper made him carry
baskets of groceries to customers, who blamed
him for every egg that was Broken, instead
ot the grocer who made him do these things
so that he would get the blame. For it
seemed that he Hated the boy.
So it came to pass that Jack became
known as the Bad Boy of the Town. Little
did they think of the noble thoughts that he
sometimes thought.
lie forced his way to Mr. Sandpaper’s side.
“You do not love me,” he said bitterly;
"but praps the poor boy you have made
your grudge may save you Now.”
So saying, he rushed into the burning
house. In vain. Even as he did so the lower
part of the building Fell with a crash. He
staggered out from the ruins, bleeding and
on tire, and the brigade had to turn the
hose on him to put him out.
Still the girl stood shrieking at the window
in the upper part of the building, which, as
yet unburnt, though full of smoke and sur-
rounded by flame, had not fallen.
A cry of Dismay went up from the crowd
as the ladder —the only fire escape ladder
in the town—which the firemen had been
trying to erect, fell crashing to the ground,
and the two firemen who had esayed to climb
it dropped Bleeding to their feet.
But Jack was not beaten yet. Rushing
away lie returned with a rope, and then
spoke Ernestly to the Captain of the Brigade.
“Could you squrt a stream of water to
that window V” lie asked.
For answer the girl in the window shrieked
as the stream of water hit her.
Jack explained his plan to the Captain.
“You are a brave boy, but you can never
do it,” lie replied.
"A man can die but Once,” said our Hero.
“Let me at .least try.”
The crowd gave a cry of astonishment as
the stream of water ceased to play on the
building. Had the water failed?
But no, next moment the powerful stream
started again, and the crowd gasped with
Amazement when they saw. seated on the
end of it, and struggling to keep his balance,
Our Hero.
He shot right up to the window, the water
being well directed by the firemen,
“Fear not,” he said to the astonished girl.
“I have come to save you.”
The crowd cheered this remarkable feet;
and a new cheer Rent the Welkin as Our
Hero lowered the girl to the ground with the
rope. When lie follered, slithering down the
rope, they rushed forward to bear him up
on their arms. Even as they did so the upper
storey crashed to the ground, just as the
lower stories had done.
“Three cheers for the noble boy we did
understand!” cried the Lord Mayor.
The cheers were heartily given: and the
hat was passed round. A sum of 255. 9d.
was collected from the enthusiastic crowd.
Nor was this all. As Our Hero turned to
escape from the cheers, Mr. Sandpaper tore
himself from his Dauter, who he had been
embracing, and Interceptered him.
“Jack, ’ he said, brokenly. "I must confess
all. When your father and mother died
I took charge of you. But your father was
really the grocer. I was only his assistant;
but seeing that you were only a helpless
baby and knew nothing of the law, I embes-
seled the business. It is all jours; and if
you will help me build it up again I will
work for you on wages. It was because I

“Last night Jack told me I looked nice
enough to eat.”
“Oh, well, a little plain food wouldn’t do
him any harm.”
knew I was cheating you that I hated you.
Can you forgive me?”
“I do,” said our Hero, gentily. "But
there is no business now ; it is all burnt.”
Mr. Sandpaper drew him aside.
“That’s all right. Jack,” he said. "The
business is insured for twice what it is
worth.”
And so Jack became rich and famous, and
later on the Mayor of the town; and Mr.
Sandpaper did all the work whilst he col-
lected birds’ nests and went fishing.

The Augud of Moa.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE girl dreamed upon the mission-house
verandah. The evening, the island
and its associations all breathed of
romance. Wistfully she wondered why none
of this elixir of life had come to her. hhe
was the teacher of native children on Moa,
and was proud of being enlisted as a Dy
missionary.
From the rear rooms came the drone or
contented voices, as the missionary and lus
wife taught their pretty white children.
What a striking contrast to the lively black
piccaninnies that daily filled the sclioolhouse
of St. Paul’s!
There was one other white man on the
island, a school-teacher, too, but he lived
miles away, across the big hills in the village
of Poid. And problematical winds and
trackless hills kept, him there. And, anyway,
why should he visit uninteresting folks when
all around him were fascinating people?
The girl sighed. The man, as usual, was
privileged ; he was not afraid to roam into the
recesses of the island, to explore the secret
Zogo-grounds and spy for the great augud,
which was once necklaeed with human skulls.
She had even caught whispers that, in secret,
occasional rites were practised yet. From
behind the sclioolhouse windows _ scholars
speaking in awed whispers had pointed out
old Oroki as he stalked through the village,
on a visit from Poid. The girl had studied
with interest the fierce face of this last of
the Zogo-Ic, who strove to keep alight the
fires of a people’s superstition, and had
inherited from the dead centuries some queer
knowledge which the whites had been unable
to fathom. For ages his people had drunk
the blood of their enemies, and lived within
the worship of their augud. They had even
stolen white women. But that was before
the missionary came.
Now' the moon bathed Moa, with its
ghostly granite hills and valleys of silence,
and its villages beneath the palms by the sea.
And the lagoon, all silver, with thunder upon
its coral ramparts, and the grandeur of Moa
peak highest in all Torres Strait, and a
Brisbane girl united with the silence upon
the verandah at St. Paul’s!
Within the lagoon lay three pretty vessels
at a distance apart, almost as if distrust-
ful of one another. A black cutter, manned
by Torres island boys, searching for trochus.
A low-built, speedy Jap lugger, combing
our seas for pearl-shell. The third a grey
ketch, with a white captain and woolly-
headed Papuan crew. All had come bowling
in under reefed sail, seeking sanctuary from
an angry storm. None hail landed, for mis-
sionary people and nomads of the sea are not
always the best of friends.
The girl wondered at the white man. He
would be gone with the first break in the
weather; quite disinterestedly she wished he
would bring her some adventure. To have
come 2000 miles to work in an island of
romance, and yet not to be allowed one peep
within the veil, was heartbreaking.
On impulse she stole off the verandah and
made for the beach. The household was
asleep. The village was asleep. The moon
was clouding herself to sleep. The ketch
was invisible.
She dodged the village. It would not look
well for a lone white girl to be seen at this
hour; and, besides, she was a bit afraid
to walk among the huts of colored men at
midnight. She intercepted sufficient glances
by day.
Thrilled and not dreaming of consequences,
she stepped along, delightfully startled at
every cloud-flung shadow'. To her feet came
murmuring ripples of the sea, while land-
ward gloomed tree-masses, and distantly the
blackness of hills. The air w T as sw 7 eet, and
she caught whispers of mysterious things.
At the beach end, wdiere starlight splashed
upon rocks, there was a paddock of darkness
—the mouth of a mangrove creek. She halted
at the thought of mud and a possible alli-
gator. Anyway, she could not penetrate
that tangled maze. With a backward glance
and a smile all to herself, she nestled upon
the beach.
The grey ketch was invisible, but the stai'-
kissed lagoon was beautiful. A collar of
foam boiled far out upon the reef.
She straightened, her heart beating alertly.
Distinctly came the click-clack of rowlocks.
A dinghy coming from the ketch! But what
for? Native women?
She hurried into the shadows and stood
irresolute. If this man was coming ashore
for women, then he was breaking the most
rigid law of the mission. And she was a
lay missionary! Her duty was plain. But
would she be game to reproach him? Duty
eased her conscience of spying. And, besides,
this tasted delightfully of adventure. She
slipped into deeper shadows, and her heart
livened to the rhythm of nearing oars.
The dinghy emerged from the night and
disappeared into the creek. The girl heard a
bump as they hit the mangroves, guessed
they were fastening the dinghy; then a curse
as the white man’s boot slipped on a root.
Almost immediately they stood close by her,
four men. She crouched low', hot with the
instinct of the primitive thing ready to run.
Occasionally this type of white sea-wan-
derer had called in at the mission. Not a
bad-looking chap, brown-skinned, alert-eyed,
with the initiative that marks those who suc-
cessfully carve out a living in the ever-
changing environment of the coral seas. She
admired the enormous mops of hair on the
Papuan boys, who, naked but for a lava-
lava, were grinning as at a huge joke. The
Torres Islamjer between them was not grin-
ning, He was terrified. The girl’s sympa-
thy w r ent to him, for in the tall, well-built
body, the crinkly hair, the keen face she
recognised a man of Poid. '
The white man contemptuously fastened
a slip-knot around the islander’s neck, lash-
ing the corded end to a Papuan’s wrist, then
commanded “Hurry! Quick feller!” The
man shivered, glanced back over the lagoon,
and stepped noiselessly into the bush. The
others followed, and vanished.
With a start the girl tip-toed after them
and caught their shadows latticed amongst
the branches. Her feet itched to race back
ro the beach.
The men had no thought of being followed.
They wound amongst the bushes, never
glancing back, and vanished down a coal-
black gully. The girl, hurrying after, tripped
and slid and tumbled. She crouched, too
frightened to move. By a chance of Provi-
dence she caught them up again.
They slithered across the undulating
country that boomerangs in to the hills;
amongst timbers stunted and tall; dodging
twisted branches that moaned with the wind ;
then over rustling grass to vanish within
a cloak thrown by the black shadow of the
hills. Then followed a dodging of fantastic,
black-grey shapes, boulders very forbidding
in the misty light. A scramble up a jungly
ravine, then the first hills rising abrupt like
a crescent barrier, and a girl frarful lest she
miss these men. for without their companion-
ship she sensed a more fearful loneliness.
As they climbed she hastened among the
CANDIDATE (to voluble female voter): “Now it’s no use, Madam. I know what you're
here for —you have come here to give your husband a rest.”
rocks, with dress torn and limbs scratched
and mouth opening in energetic gasps. If
they had glanced behind they might have
caught the glint of two frightened eyes in
the starlight. They scrambled over the
hills and clambered down into the pit of a
valley, on the far side of which rose higher
and blacker hills; and, overshadowing all,
the peak of Moa.
The Islander halted. He threw himself
at the white man’s feet, he kissed his
master’s knees, he whined like an animal.
The master nodded to the Papuans. They
threw the Islander, and gurgling their delight
nearly throttled him. They gouged his eyes,
and lie screamed amongst the snapping twigs.
The girl’s heart froze. She was physically
incapable of interfering, and—what, of her-
self? She realised her utter defencelessness.
These brutes now torturing a strong man—
what would they delight to do to her, a girl,
and a white girl! Was there anything they
could not do? She shuddered at the possi-
bility of further adventure.
The islander sobbed. They kicked him
to his feet, and pathetically he stumbled on.
The girl looked around beseechingly. But
only twisted shadows and the stars answered
her prayer. She crept on, the sobs of the
man of Poid keeping her on their track.
She was close behind the men as they
crossed the valley. She did not know that
the natives whispered of it as the Valley of
Despair.
Stumbling up the peak of Moa, they
pushed into a jungle, and in the inky black-
ness the girl’s hand could once have touched
the rear man. Luckily for her, the Papuans
were too intent on the islander to notice
anything else. Within the jungle, he sank
to the tree roots. The Papuans manhandled
him joyously until he crawled again.
They came to a boulder, the size of a house
and so black that you could not tell it was
rock until your outstretched hand touched it.
On his belly the islander crawled under
the bushes, working a path along the side of
the rock. Behind him crept a Papuan, his
teeth snapping at the islander’s heels, while
his comrade gurgled laughter at every sharp
intake of the breath of the Poid man. The
white man came last.
The shrubbery ended. Crawling, the
girl’s hands told her she was on sand.
A relieved oath from the darkness ahead
and the sudden flash of a torch ! The girl’s
bewildered eyes caught cleft walls with
tangled vegetation.
The white man sprang erect, expectancy
on his face. Luckily none looked behind,
although the black men were plainly in a
hurry to get back: The white man was all
eagerness to push forward and snarled at
the now frightened Papuans. With bowed
head the islander did not open his eyes.
“Go on, quick feller!” snapped the white
man. The girl caught the gleam of an
automatic.
The cave walls widened rapidly; the roof
rose into invisibility. A desperate courage
warmed the girl. They walked like phan-
toms in the silence.
Suddenly a roaring “Hooray!” crashed
from wall to wall. The white man stood
amazed. The blacks dropped terrified. The
girl clutched her heart to smother the stab
of fear.
“Get up ! Quick feller !”
he roared; and the roar
echoed back and silenced
them all.
They slouched forward,
and the girl noted that
the white man threw his
torchlight on the floor
and kept behind the boys
and so made escape im-
possible. Presently lie flashed the torch
upwards.
The Papuans grovelled, but the man from
Poid crouched as if he knew he was doomed.
The girl gasped, her eyes widening with
understanding, her heart thumping with
exultation.
For before them sat the great augud of
Moa, the idol worshipped for a thousand
years! Upon its dais of coral blocks and
sacred shells it squatted, a monstrous figure
of a man, massive in plates of tortoise-shell.
Its flaring eyes were mother of pearl; its
teeth nautilus-shell.
The torch flashed around, and the girl
stared, with spine creeping. Pyramids of
skulls were built around the augud—painted
skulls of men and women and children ; hun-
dreds of them, in pyramids, paying a death-
like homage.
The girl’s brain raced triumphantly as she
remembered the legends of these people, as
far as they had entrusted the missionary
with their confidence. Here was their tor-
toise-shell augud, just as the old ex-cannibals
had described; here the sacred shells, the
skulls of their enemies and victims: here the
black Zogo-stone once anointed with human
oil; here other weird things she could not
place. Then the torch flashed upon her and
she shrank in the full terror of discovery.
“Well?” he asked. But she stood fear-
fully silent.
“Slip your tongue !” he demanded. “What
are you doing here?”
“What are yon?” she whispered.
“Minding my own business. And you?”
“Minding mine.”
“In what way, Miss Spy?”
"I’m watching unauthorised persons upon
the island!” she snapped.
“Well, what are you going to do about
it?” he grinned.
She stared, puzzled.
“We’ll have a straight-out understanding,”
he said, “and lively, because I’m in a hurry.
You’re the little busybody at St. Paul’s.
Well, I’m taking this augud, because every
plate is of marvellous quality, and tortoise-
shell is rocketting just now. So that’s that!”
He turned and booted the Papuans.
“But you can’t take it,” said the girl.
“Why not?” he asked.
“Because it belongs to the people of Moa.
It i 3 their god. They have venerated it for
centuries.”
He smiled queerly. “Well, I’m blessed!
And that from a missionary ! Here I come
to destroy the idol of the heathen, as the
Bible commands. And you, a missionary, a
prophet, speak against the book. And just
remember, girl with the scared face and
pretty hair, that years ago the missionaries
invaded these islands, and will) hammer and
fire destroyed the idols of these people, and
did all in their power to annihilate the old
heathen beliefs. Only on a few odd islands
did the Zogo -la manage to secrete their tools
of an idolatrous trade.” lie smiled mock-
ingly. “Shame on you for a Christian ! You
who would prevent me from completing the
good work!”
He kicked the man from Poid. “Get up!”
lie commanded savagely.
The girl stepped forward. Somehow she
felt a little surer of herself.
“Stop that!” she said resolutely. “You
have tortured that poor man enough. Let
him alone.”
“Wliat? Him, too?” said the man in
astonishment. “How you, a missionary, do
decide against all that is right! Why, thus
man is Judas Iscariot. He lias betrayed his
very god. He sold him for a bottle of rum.
This way,” lie smiled. “Judas here is one
of my signed-on boys, from I’oid. A month
back, out on tin l Barrier, he boasted that lie
was the succeeding priest to Oroki, the next
of the Zogo-/c to guard the god and keep
alive the old beliefs, in the hope that one
day the people might come against the white
man. I laughed at his tale, and in a boast-
ful moment lie said he could sell me
the augud itself for a bottle of rum.
I closed with the offer, and Judas
became beastly drunk. Look at him
now. Get to work,” lie snapped at
the Papuans.
The girl sprang to the augud, facing
the man, with her arms protectiugly
outspread on the dais. The great
figure above her glared out into the
darkness.
“You will not destroy
it,” she cried. “It belongs
to a people and it is
priceless. Wait until Mr.
Morrisy says what is to
be done with it. He may
sell it to a museum.”
“That’s just what he
won't do,” said the man.
' Besides, it is not his to
sell. Do you, a mission-
ary, want to thieve a
people's property for a
museum !”
“You must wait until Mr. Morrisy
says wlmt is to be done with it,” she
replied defiantly.
He regarded her amusedly. “Now I am
going to get rid of you," he smiled—“kindly
and nicely but effectually.”
“How?” she whispered.
“By making love to you.”
She drew a startled breath and stood
erect.
“You wouldn’t dare,” she said.
“I'll soon show you,” he grinned. “Now,
listen. Judas is incapable of carrying away
any of this shell, so I have told him to guide
you back. Go!”
The girl remained.
He stepped forward, and she shrank back
against the augud. His hand caressed her
hair. She flung his arm aside. “Go!” he said.
“You wouldn’t dare,” she whispered, and
felt that the very augud could hear her
heart-beats.
He flung his arms around her and kissed
her upon the lips and cheek and hair, strong
and fiercely. Then he whispered hoarsely:
“Go! It is the third and last time I ask.”
She sped into the blackness. He fol-
lowed slowly, flashing the torch before her.
At the cave entrance she turned and sig-
nalled him back. He stood watching her
heels as they wriggled below the bushes.
* * * *
But she was not yet finished with the
night. For as she clawed her way from out
the bushes her hands touched the falling
body of Judas, with Oroki’s arrow through
his heart.

What crops do the best in. peaty soils in
Queensland and ivhat is the most, suitable
manure? —1769.
Peaty soils that have been drained and
aerated am suitable' for the production of
all forms of root crops. Where they exist in
close proximity to fair-sized towns or cities
all market-garden crops are recommended.
Sugar-cane does well on the peaty soils
about Nam hour. As these soils are very rich
in nitrogen and humus, nitrogenous manures
are not usually required. Lime is frequently
beneficial and a mixture of sulphate of
potash and basic superphosphate, say ill'll),
of sulphate of potash and 2001 b. of basic
superphosphate, should be useful.
Where in N.S.W. cun I hare analysed a

—lB2O.
The sample should be milked direct into
a sterile small bottle (about 2ozi. capacity)
and posted immediately to the Director, Vet-
erinary Research Station, Glenfield(N.S.W.),
where it will be examined free of charge.
The bottle should be labelled with the name
of the cow and a covering letter should be
forwarded with the sample.
Are Any or a rabbits obtainable in Aus-
tralia?—lSU.
No. Get in touch with Dept, of Agricul-
ture ; also the Ministry of Agriculture, White-
hall-place, London, S.W.I.
Jlas it been proved that half-tone gramo-
ph one needles wear electrically-recorded re-
tards more than, loud-lone needles? —lBl4.
So far as we can ascertain, no test has
been made to prove that either needle wears
a record more than the other. Expert opinion
would decide in favor of the half-tone needle,
provided mechanical parts were correct.
Buyers of silver-lead ore for treatment
in Australia, or for export? —l(sB7.
Broken Hill Associated Smelters. Port
Pirie, S.A., are the only lead smelters
operating in Australia to-day. Buyers of
silver-lead ores are: O. T. Lempriere and
Go., 5 Macquarie-place, Sydney; Brandeis,
Goldschmidt and Go., (>0 Queen-street Mel-
bourne; Frank Hanfbridge, 22 Bridge-street,
Sydney; Burkard and Go.. 26-80 Bridge-
street, Sydney; Francis 11. Snow Pty., Ltd.,
King William-street, Adelaide.
Best method of painting concrete baths,
and cost? —18(54.
Two suitable paints are Major Bros.’
special concrete ready-mixed white paint,
and Lewis Berger and Sons' cement and
floor paint. Baths should be emptied and
surface exposed to the sun for at least seven
days before painting. If the surface is
moist the paint subsequently flakes off. It
is recommended that an expert from one of
the paint manufacturing firms be asked to
inspect the baths. The cost of the area sub-
mitted would be from £l2 to £l5.
Titles of books dealing with the feeding
of stock? —1840.
“Feeds and Feeding,” by Henry and Mor-
rison ; obtainable from Angus and Robert-
son, 8!) Gastlereagh-street, Sydney. Price

(1) What railway station in Australia
puts through the greatest number of passen-
gers in a-single day? (2) What station in
Australia sends out the greatest number of
trains in a, single day? —lB27.
(1) Vic. Railway Dept, advises that
200,(100 people pass through Flin'ders-street
station daily. (2) Central Station, Sydney.
What is the probable value of two Baxter
prints, subjects Pom arc, Queen of Tahiti;
and Mr. Pritchard, British Consul at Tahiti.
Pictures arc 9 x 11 inches, mounted in an-
tique gilt frames? —1817.
If in very fine condition and unfaded,
worth about £ll for the pair. Try Tyrrell's,
Ltd., Gawler-place, Adelaide.
A 'nines of books on botanical treatment
of disease? —1884.
Most proscriptions used by medical men
contain the active principle of one or more
plants and are to that extent “botanical.”
The commonest drugs like morphia, digitalis,
mux vomica, gentian and castor-oil all come
from plants. If interested further get
“Materia Medica,” by Hale White, and read
part 11. Angus and Robertson’s have also
"The Magic of Herbs” by Leyell.
The Service Dept, informed me that there
is no such title as King's Sergeant in the
Australian forces. Is there such a title as
King's Corporal? —l9so.
There is no such rank as King’s Sergeant
or King’s Corporal in any of the military
forces of the British Empire.
(1) A girl, 18 years of age, marries with-
out k»r parents’ consent. She leaves her
husband and refuses to return. Can the
marriage be annulled? (2) If not, can the
husband get an order to compel her to live
with him? (3) If she refuses can he divorce
her before the lapse of three years?— lBss.
(1) Marriages are not voided or affected by
reason of the fa'ct of any defect or error in
the declaration where the identity of the
parties to the marriage is not in question.
(2) The law differs in various States and
countries, but in N. S. Wales if his wife has
left him he can sue for a restitution of con-
jugal rights and obtain an order that she
return to him. (3) If she refuses to return,
that fact constitutes desertion, and he can
proceed to sue for a divorce on that ground
without reference to the three years’ absence.
Is there a paint which will seal narrow
cracks in the cement lining of a tank?—
1924.
Try Elaterite waterproofing paint. The
material is applied straight from the can,
without heating; 17s. 6d. per gal. f.o.b. from
Lindsay A. Cormack, 4 Underwood-street,
Sydney.
A number of persons bought blocks of land
in a local subdivision, paying a deposit and
agreeing to pay the balance within a speci-
fied time. There teas gross misrepresenta-
tion by the salesmen as to site, distances, etc.
I enclose a copy of the purchase agreement.
Is this printed form legal? What do you
advise me to do in the matter? —1-831.
(1) A contract “in print” is construed to
be a contract “in writing.” (2) Assuming
the contract to have been signed by the pur-
chaser, then the acknowledgment in clause 15
will stop him from any allegation of mis-
representation. Assuming it not to have been
signed, then the intending purchaser would
have tin 1 right to sue for a return of the
deposit on (lie ground of misrepresentation.
Proof of the misrepresentation would pro-
bably be difficult, but it is essential to suc-
cess. Also it would have to be shown that
it was by reason of such misrepresentation
the plaintiff was induced to pay the deposit.
You ask for advice. If the contract lias been
signed, then the only course is to forfeit the
deposit and in future be chary of touring
land-agents. Always read a contract care-
fully. If not signed, do not plunge into law
until you have placed all the facts and all
t lie evidence you have to support them before
an experienced solicitor.
I want to buy a house which is almost
complctcd. Where can / obtain a loan?
—lBB6.
The vendor may he prepared to receive the
purchase money in easy instalments at a
reasonable rate of interest; or, if the pro-
perty is purchased through a solicitor, he
may be able to arrange terms and secure a
loan. The Savings Banks are steady lenders
on this class of security.
What half-dozen publications in Sydney
besides The Bulletin offer a market for
shoft stories , articles . etc., and what type of
story or article is acceptable to each? —1915.
The Woman's Mirror, Sydney Mail,
World’s News, Triad, the Home, Smith’s
Weekly, Beckett's Budget and the
Woman’s Budget are among the chief
buyers of short stories in Sydney. Almost
all the dailies, principal weeklies and
monthlies published in Sydney buy articles
from the outside contributor. Close study of
each publication will reveal its special
editorial requirements. The Australian
and New Zealand Writers and Artists’
Year Book, to be published in January, aims
to assist writers who seek this information.
(1) Names of books dealing with cream-
grading, neutralising and churning? (2)
We put the cream over the flash pasteuriser
—is this the latest met h0d? —1727.
(1) Two good books are “The Butter
Industry.” by ilunziker (4.25.). and “Prin-
ciples and Practices of Buttermaking,” by
Kay and Larsen (195.). Both obtainable
from Angus and Robertson, 8!) Castlereagh-
street, Sydney. Free pamphlets on different
phases of dairying can he obtained from the
Department of Agriculture, Sydney. (2) You
have adopted modern practice by passing
the cream through the pasteuriser at a high
temperature, 185 degrees to 190 degrees, and
then cooling it to a low temperature, say
45 degrees F„ and churning at about 46
degrees to. 48 degrees F. These are the tem-
peratures recommended by the Dairy Branch
Officers of the N.S.W. Department of Agri-
culture.
Would it be possible to drain a swamp
into a river a quarter of a mile distant by
syphoning the water through an ordinary
garden hose? —1794.
Yes. Such syphon pipe might be carried
over higher intervening ground provided that
the height does not exceed 20 feet above
the level of the water in the swamp. Syphon-
ing is not a simple proposition, and it would
be as well to consult an engineer.
Is eucalyptus gum a cure for dysentery?
—1895.
There are many forms of dysentery. Diar-
rhoea and dysentery are different diseases.
Eucalyptus gum is prescribed for one or two
forms of dysentery, hut it should never be
used without the strictest medical super-
vision. Three have been one or two cases
recently of severe eucalyptus-poisoning of
persons who have used the drug indiscrimi-
nately.
To a person who is physically debarred
from earning a living, but who has a few
hundreds, what is the best- investment? J
believe the banks give 41 p.c. for a long
fixed deposit, but this is hardly sufficient. —
1919.
Seeing that you can’t earn any more, you
must not, above all things, lose the little
you’ve got. You’d better therefore buy Gov-
ernment stock. Take the stock liable to tax
—it will give you a better return, and the
tax you will have to pay, if any, will be
very small. If others are not dependent on
you, you might consider buying an annuity
from a reputable insurance office. But be
careful —Australia has more weak insurance
offices than strong ones at present.
What is the AM. A.? Provided one is elig-
ible, how can one become a member of the
Queensland District ? —1873.
The Australian Journalists’ Association is
the organisation covering employees in jour-
nalism throughout Australia-—metropolitan,
country and freelance —and artists and pho-
tographers. It is registered under the
Federal Arbitration Act and. in Queensland,
under the State Act. E. G. Marks, Daily
Standard Office, Brisbane, secretary of the
Queensland District, will supply you with
membership form.
(1) 1 have been notified by the local
(Sydney suburban) couneil to drain my
land. The water comes from, a spring on
the next lot, and the owner has been simi-
larly notified. If he complies the water will
cease to come into my lot. Is it necessary
for me to lay drains? (2) In the event
of my haring to comply with their notifica-
tion, can you tell me if 1 will have to engage
a dr diner? (3) What is an average rate per
foot for laying drains? —1940.
(1) It is necessary for you to comply
with the requisition unless the council
consents to withdraw it. (2) As the
drainage would have to be done to the
satisfaction of the Council you would
probably find it necessary to engage a
drainer. (3) Depends on the nature of
the ground.
Meaning of word Wallumbilla? —1890.
Wallumbilla does not appear in any of
the aboriginal vocabularies consulted. It
may, however, be a combination of two
separate words, “wallum” meaning many
and “billa” meaning a creek.
I have had two years' actual carpentering
experience and have worked as a carpenter's
laborer for years. Could I obtain a position
in N.S.W. as a carpenter’s laborer where I
could gain further experience with the idea
of becoming a competent tradesman? —170 S.
The award governing the calling in N.S.M .
provides that if a workman uses carpenter's
tools he must receive the award rate of pay.
Having the experience you mention, you
should be fit to take a carpenter’s job. There
are special night courses for journeymen
carpenters at the Sydney Leclmical Col-
lege. One way would be to work for a
friend who is a contractor.
How can a lad of 19 years learn navi-
gation? —1897.
A candidate for a second-mate s certificate
must have served four years at sea in a deck
capacity. You could comply with this by
serving an apprenticeship in j company such
as the A.U.S.N., although it is doubtful
whether you could become apprenticed, the
usual age being 17. Or you could serve
four years as ordinary and able seaman in
the Merchant Service, and during that time
study the technical side at the Nautical
School conducted by Capt. F. J. Bayldon,
Royal Exchange Chambers, 54a Pitt-street,
Sydney. A good textbook is Nieholls's
“Guide to Navigation." procurable at Turner
and Henderson, 16 Hunter-street, Sydney.
Where can l obtain information regarding
■Jupancse dwarf trees? —1638.
Communicate with Mr. Ivuwahata, 183
George-street, Sydney, who grows dwarf trees
as a hobby.
Information Supplied.

“I do not believe
those men could turn out a had job”
So said a recent visitor to our Works. He was
watching the making of moulds for marine engine
bed-plates, and the infinite care exercised prompted
the remark.
Naturally, as each shop was inspected, the vast
resources could not be overlooked, but the
dominant impression all the time was care and
still more care on the part of everyone.
The visitor was right; with A.W. workmen it
is a tradition that only the best workmanship is
of value, either to us or to you.
Thanks to the extraordinary facilities at our dis-
posal, we are able to maintain this quality with
all our products and yet keep our prices strictly

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
It was hoped early in the week that
Pantheon would be a starter for the W. S.
Cox Plate at Moonee Valley on Saturday,
but an ominous swelling developed on the
inside of the near foreleg after his gallop
on Thursday morning. This became worse
consequent upon his next visit to the track,
and the English horse was fated not to
appear at the Valley, or at Flemington,
either. The only other withdrawal from the
W. S. Cox Plate was Silvius, who took his
place in the Moonee Valley Cup field. This
left 10 starters, and, taken on the whole,
they were the most interesting lot seen in
a Victorian w.f.a. race this season. Some
spirited betting closed with Amounis and
Gothic equal favorites at 3 to 1, the Caul-
field Guineas winner Avant Courier being
at 7 to 2 and Merry Mint at 8 to 1.
Despite an exhibition of piggishness at
the barrier by Thracian, the start was a
good one. Avant Courier, who went particu-
larly well in his preliminary, immediately
ran to the front, with Metellus, Merry Mint,
Thracian, Amounis, Sacedon, Gothic and
Chariot following; Kelso’s pair were last,
leader with three furlongs to go; Gothic was
proved their positions, the three-year-old
being three-quarters of a length behind the
leader with three furlongs to go; Gotbis was
then a length away, while Merry Mint,
Amounis and Thracian were next. Avant
Courier was still in charge rounding the
home turn, but Amounis, who had come with
a brilliant run, tackled the colt in the
straight, and although Valicare’s brother
fought it right out the Sydney horse was a
little too good. A neck separated them at
the finish, Gothic, who was a little unlucky
in the straight, being a length behind Avant
Courier. Thracian, Merry Mint and Metel-
lus were closest of the others; Bacchus was
a bad last. Of course, it was not his
distance, but his Cup supporters would have
liked to see him closer. It was a very
exciting race and Toohey gave one of his
good exhibitions on Amounis, who left the
91 furlongs behind in 2min. Not par-
ticularly fast time, but the going could have
been better.
t There were 15 starters for the Moonee
Valley Cup, the only scratching being Star
d’Or, who, like Pantheon, was under a cloud.
In his absence, Scobie’s other charge, Val-
orem, was the early favorite, but so per-
sistent was the demand for Silvius that at
the close of operations Valorem and the
English horse were bracketed together at
5 to 1. Eridanus (6 to 1), Tookarby, Son
o’ Mine and Spear Maiden (7 to 1) were
all in request, while there were a few
inquiries for Tangible, Imitator and
Spearset at 20 to 1. T. M. Burke’s
gelding, Seventh Heaven, went to the
front from the start, and was two
lengths clear of Silvius passing the mile
post, Miss Disraeli, Son o’ Mine, Val-
wyne, Bard of Avon, Brigadier Bob, Val-
orem, Tookarby, Spear Maiden, Eridanus
and Spearset following in that order.
Seventh Heaven w T as still in the lead from
a strung-out field half a mile from home,
but Silvius’s victory was already proclaimed.
Passing the leader in a few strides, Sidney
Kidman’s horse was in front three furlongs
from home, and from then on it was a cake-
walk, for although Son o’ Mine made a
determined effort to catch the leader, Sil-
vius simply cantered in four lengths ahead
of Sol Green’s importation, with Eridanus,
who also finished well, two lengths further
back and Valorem fourth; Spearset, Spear
Maiden and Seventh Heaven followed. Not
for a long time has there been such an easy
win in an important race, and Silvius, who
carried Bst. 51b. —a stone more than his
Melbourne Cup weight—immediately became
favorite for the biggest handicap of the year.
A four-year-old bay stallion by Silvern-
Addenda, he looks a liigh-class horse, and
evidently is. He is trained by 11. Butler
and Harold Jones had the mount. The time
for the Hi furlongs was 2min. 29fsec.
Highland, who had run second to Quirk
in the Windsor Handicap at Caulfield, was
a hot favorite —7 to 4 at the finish —for the
Dundonald Handicap. He ran a fair race,
but Durward, a 10-to-l chance whom Perci-
val rode in his most vigorous, if unorthodox,
style, snatched victory in the last stride
or two from Marcia (20 to 1) ; Borrodale
(8 to 1) was a close third.
TATT’S BOARD OF CONTROL IN TASMANIA.
Ted Reid. Bill Ramsay. Jack Coleman.
Trivalve and Winalot, who fought out so
exciting a finish in the A.J.C. Derby on
October 1, will meet again in the Victoria
Derby at Flemington on Saturday, and
Merry Mint will also be in the field. Tri-
valve has come through an old-fashioned
preparation very well, and, barring accidents,
will see a short" price. All the same, if
Winalot is as fit as he was at Randwiclc
(that may be questionable) and is ridden
with less anxiety to get the business over,
he will not improbably turn the tables.
Nor is Merry Mint’s chance to be lightly dis-
missed ; the M.L. gelding ran creditably at
Randwick considering his interrupted pre-
paration, and can do better. Many Vic-
torians believe that Avant Courier will beat
the lot of them. He is a brilliant colt un-
doubtedly, but his way of running his races,
so reminiscent of Valicare’s, does not suggest
stamina. And it takes more than a dashing
mile or mile-and-a-quarter horse to win the
Victoria Derby nowadays; Manfred’s tinm
in 1925 was 2min. 31isec., and Rampion’s
last year was 2min. 32^sec.
* * * *
Mollison won the Maribyrnong Trial and
the V.A.T.C. Debutant Stakes in smashing
style. A youngster must be good to win the
Maribyrnong Plate with a 101 b. penalty, but
there will be heaps of money to say that E.
M. Pearce’s colt can do it. Salzach and
Ramulus have first-class credentials, and it
should be a close race.
Amounis should score in the Melbourne
Stakes; he certainly looks to hold Gothic
safe. Perhaps Silvius will be the danger, for
it is hard to estimate how good this English
horse of Kidman’s is.
$
Now that the pen has been put through
Pantheon’s name, Pilliewinkie (9st. 71b.)
will be alone in his glory as topweight in
the Melbourne Cup, unless anything hap-
pens to him. He was a good horse once,
but he is eight years old, and it is 18 months
since he showed any form. Next in order
of weight comes Murillo (Bst. 11.1 b.), who
has been prominent in the betting ever since
he won the Metropolitan with Bst. Murillo
is owned and trained by a man whose talent
for the game almost amounts to genius. But
the task he accomplished at Randwick was
easy compared to what awaits him on Tues-
day. Bicolor (7st. 121 b.), who ran away
with a 10-furlong race at Randwick on
Derby day, is the hope of Sydney. Among
those he beat was Son o’ Mine (Bst.), but
Son o’ Mine has improved since and in shape
and style looks more like a stayer. The dilfi-
culty with Sol Green’s horse is that he
will meet Silvius (7st. 51b.) 201 b. worse
than in the Moonee Valley Cup. One
can’t get away from Silvius, who won four
races in succession (two at a mile and a
half) in Adelaide during the winter; was a
close second to Royal Charter at w.f.a.
after his spell, and then, with a stone more
than his Melbourne Cup weight, made hacks
of his opponents in the Moonee Valley Cup,
a race associated with memories of Blue
Spec and Clean Sweep. He has been
weighted at 9st. for the Hotham Handicap
on Saturday, which shows what the handi-
capper thinks of him. Still, on the chance
that lie may turn out another Ruenalf or
Duke Foote, it may be wise to have a saver
on something else. In this respect, Killara
(7st. 71b.) has an attractive appearance.
This son of Magpie—lleen Alwyne, also
Adelaide-owned and a four-year-old, won the
A.R.C. Alderman Cup, 14 furlongs, in the
good time of 3min. and finished
strongly; he also came with a great run in
the Adelaide Cup, 13 furlongs, won by Three
Kings, and many people were surprised that
lie wasn’t placed second. He has been gal-
loping with Silvius on the track, and going
well. Second to Killara in the Alderman
Cup was Frilford (7st. 31b.), who also has
claims, having won at two miles. Like
Murillo, Silvius and Son o’ Mine, he is
an English horse with a staying pedigree
(in his case, Swynford—Nicely), and he
may be capable of better than he has done
yet. The Derby will show how far Trivalve
(7st. 31b.) and Winalot (7st. lib.) are to
be considered; the winner will of course,
carry 7st. 61b. A good three-year-old is
always dangerous in the Cup, but it is
doubtful whether this year’s Derby field
contains an Artilleryman or even a Rich-
mond Main. Selections :
Melbourne Stakes: Amounis.
Maribyrnong Plate : Mollison, 1; Ramulus,
2; Salzach, 3.
Derby : Winalot, 1; Trivalve, 2 ; Merry
Mint, 3.
Cantala Stakes: Vaals, 1; Quan Tart, 2.
Hotham Handicap: Ivillara, 1; Son o’
Mine, 2; Cairncross, 3.
Melbourne Cup: Silvius, 1; Killara, 2;
Frilford, 3.

Backers were well on the spot in most of
the races at Canterbury Park (N.S.W.) on
Saturday, especially the thro-- divisions of
the Highweight Handicap. These went to
Cadenza (3 to 1), Kaiwarra (5 to 2) and
Factor (6 to 4), and only the last-named
gave his supporters any cause for uneasiness.
Gaylight (8 to 1) making a close finish of

he rode Cadenza, Greenie (6 to 1) in the
Flying Handicap—this Greenstead mare, did
not stop, as was previously her custom in
Sydney—and Royal Digliton (5 to 1) in
the Ashbury Handicap. Royal Dighton.
however, may liave been lucky to beat the,
topweight, Royal Sun (6 to 1), on whom
McCarten was not seen to advantage.
Another who met with misfortune “in run-
ning” was Night Heron, a 6-to-4 favorite
for the Canterbury Handicap, and in the
circumstances third was the best he could
do. Nan Kourgan, winner of this race, is
trained at Canterbury by her owner, Dr.
Dunn. Her success was very welcome to the
ring, as she went out at 10 to 1.

Bad luck smote McSliortodds heavily at
the Victoria Park (N.S.W.) Cup meeting on
Saturday. He had a turn-up in the Novice
Handicap when Prattle bounced home at
12’s, but after that 11 straight favorites
scored. These included Wallace King, 9 to
4 on ; Ilka, 3 to 1 and 7 to 4 on (this daugh-
ter of Finland won her heat and the run-off
of the J. I). Handicap) ; Tin Gow, 7 to 4
on ; Currawong 5 to 2 ; Miss Tony, 7 to 4 on ;
Lambero, evens; Inclusive, 6 to 4; Cocoon,
5 to 4; Violosca, 6 to 4 on, and Dionysus,
3 to 1. In the first division of the Sir
Dudley de Chair Gold Cup, worth £lOOO, a
rank outsider, Flipinere, ran neck and neck
with Cocoon, early favorite for the race. It
was a sight that sent the goose-quills scam-
pering down the ringmcn’s backs, but their
luck was out once more: Cocoon prevailed
by half a head. Cocoon’s task in the run-
off’ was lightened by Lambero being left.
The Watermen
The Ilenley-on-Yarra regatta on Saturday
was probably the most representative thing of
its kind held in Australia. Not only were most
of the States represented, both in the row-
ing and sculling events, but the Waitemata
four from Maoriland also appeared, as well
as W. A. Stevenson, a sculler from the
same club, who is champion of his Dominion,
For the first time since 1911 the Ladies’
Challenge Cup (otherwise the Schools Fours)
was won by St. Peter’s College, Adelaide;
Melbourne High School, which had held the
trophy for six years, was beaten by three-
quarters of a length in smin. 40sec. for the
mile. The Stewards’ Grand Challenge Cup
for senior fours was easily annexed by Wai-
temata, which defeated Nagamhie (Vic.) in
the final by three lengths, in smin. 28sec.
Mosman (N.S.W.), stroked by H. L. Calla-
ghan, had a hard battle in the Grand Chal-
lenge Cup for senior eights, but emerged
victorious by a length and a quarter from
Melbourne, with Mildura only half a length
away third; the time was 4min. 50sec. Mel-
bourne had been hard pressed by the Tamar
(Tas.) crew in its heat, but Mosman would
have won in any event. The Yarra Challenge
Cup for scullers was easy for R. Pearce, the
N.S.W. and Australian champion, who beat
another Sydney man in J. A. Goulding in
smin. 28sec. Goulding was disqualified,
however, for boring, and Stevenson was
given second place.
On Monday, the sculling race for the selec-
tion of an Olympic representative was won
with the greatest ease by R. Pearce, who
covered the Olympic icourse of 2000 metres
(about one mile 427 yards) in 7min. 24sec..
or 22sec. better than the world’s record
for the distance put up by Kelly at Antwerp
in 1920. Goulding was second, and the Ben-
digo sculler, 11. Cambridge, third.

THE VITAL QUESTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“The breakdown, of favorite after favorite ha>
seldom put so much money into the bookmakers'
pockets as since the entries for the present Spring
meetings. Why is it that every year the rod under
which punters are passed grows heavier and
heavier ?” —Sydney D.T.
Let learned theologians logic chop
With scientific chaps entrenched behind
The Darwin evolutionary prop.
About the antecedents of mankind.
I care not whether Adam was designed
By angels or evolved from simian blood.
A tougher problem occupies my mind :
Why does the punter always come a thud?
When will the cost of necessaries drop?
And Bolshie propagandists cease to grind
Their teeth? And flappers chuck the Eton
crop ?
And treaties of disarmament be signed
By nations leaving all their feuds behind?
Of queries such as these I hear a flood.
A knot more intricate I’d fain unwind.
Why does the punter always come a thud?
When will the Yankees tire of ginger pop
And burst the Prohibition chains that
bind?
Where shall we look for bowlers who can
cop
Wickets when England’s best are next
combined
Against us? Will the eager borers find
Oil, dinkum oil, beneath the Roma mud?
Who knows? To speculate I’m more in-
clined
Why does the punter always come a thud?
My second leg was Pantheon. I opined
Besetting cares would scoot and troubles
scud.
Rede me the riddle, brother, underlined:
Why does the punter always come a thud?

JUST as the word “Kodak” came to be used
for any camera, so “Kelvinator,” because it
is the oldest and best-known system, has come
to be used for any electric refrigerator. But
if you want the real thing in electric refrigera-
tion, you must see that you get a real
Kelvinator. The distinction is important.
For the past thirteen years Kelvinator-
Nizer installations have been working continu-
ously and efficiently in the U.S.A. To-day
no home is considered complete without its
Kelvinator, no catering business properly
equipped without its Nizer.
But, you may ask, what about here in
Australia—what about some performances a
bit nearer home? Once more Kelvinator-
Nizer can give you proof that other systems
of electric refrigeration cannot approach.
Four years’ use has proved many
hundreds of Kelvinators throughout
Australia (from the Governor-General’s
residence to suburban villas) to give
perfect electric refrigeration for domes-
tic use.
Over fifteen hundred NIZER instal-
lations are used to keep leading brands
of ice-cream (like Peters’, in N.S.W.,
and “Arctic,” in Queensland) in that
perfect condition from which they have
gained part of their reputation.
Don’t take risks; instal the real Kelvinator—
then you can be certain of lasting satisfaction.

“Slide”: At long last N.S.W. rowing is
able to claim an amateur club in the country
—the Aqua R. C. Headquarters will be at
Murwillumbah, on the Tweed River, a
stream which has mothered many sturdy
oarsmen. The newcomer will be only a sort
of stepchild, so to speak, for it has received
Sydney permission to affiliate with the
Queensland R. A., which is a next-door neigh-
bor. The Q.R.A. comprises several country
clubs, so the Aqua R. C. will, no doubt, be
properly fostered and trained up in the way
it should go.

“Blade”: Albert Barry, the English
sculler, has deposited £lOO in Canada for
another race with Goodsell. The Australian
woh so easily last time that it hardly seems
worth while, but evidently Barry has found
backers convinced of his improvement, or
else the money in the game over there is
good enough to make even the backing of a
losing chance profitable.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Billy McAlister kept on his winning way
by practically outing Ecs Jackson (Bst.
4Alb.) in the sixth round of their contest at
the Leichhardt Stadium on Friday night.
Jackson made McAlister fight his darnedest,
and was going well until lie stopped a wicked
right with his jaw and went down for eight.
Billy was dealing it out hot and strong when
the referee wisely intervened.
* * * *
Boxing was shoved out. of the Sydney
Stadium on Friday night to make room for
another attempt to popularise wrestling.
Walter Miller and A 1 Ivarasick were billed
to wrestle eight 10-minute rounds, the
stranglehold being barred. Each foreign
gentleman was declared to weigh 12st. The
contest was savage and brutal : beside this
later style of “wrestling” boxing is a parlor
game. At times Ivarasick punched, kicked
and bit; and in-amiable retaliation Miller
stood on the Russian’s face. Walter won the
first fall in the fifth round ; he was tearing
the Russian in halves, as it seemed, and the
victim ended the agony by tapping the mat.
One incident, at least, was amusing. Miller
had an affectionate grip across Kara.’s
features, and thrice the latter hit the hand
hard. Then Walter shifted it, and Kara,
added the “sick” by punching his own nose
so hard as to draw blood copiously. Kara-
sick got a fall in the eighth round, but Miller
was miles ahead on points and received
referee Bannar’s award.
* * * *
A farce in two acts was put on at Mel-
bourne Stadium on Saturday night by John
Kilonis (12st. 71b.) and Bill Meeske (12st.
101 b.). It was to have, consisted of four
rounds of wrestling and eight rounds of
boxing, but the principals apparently got
their parts mixed, for the grappling act was
mostly punching, of a sort. The climax came
when Bill was hurled head foremost from
the ring in the second round, and John, by
this time disqualified, stood posed in mid-
ring, like Horatius on the bridge. The second
act was enough to make the late Marquis of
Queensberry roll over in his coffin. After
each “boxer” had paid several spectacular
visits to the canvas, apparently in the last
stages of exhaustion. John received a slap
on the top of the head from Bill’s open glove
and went down and out. And the crowd
didn’t even ask for its money back.
Racquet and Bawl
“Deuce” : The Sydney metropolitan tennis
championships at Stratlifield provided a sur-
prise in the defeat of Harry Ilopman by
L. E. Baker, 7-5, 4-0, 6-1. Baker’s severe
service and deadly smashing were the chief
factors in his victory. Ilopman got a bit
of his own back in the doubles final, when,
with Jack Crawford, he beat Baker and
R. O. Cummings, 4-6, 6-2, 7-5. Hopman
made a much better showing than his part-
ner, who was decidedly off his game for the
greater part of the bout. The young man
will have to liven up if he is going to prove,
a success in the inter-State tourney in Mel-
bourne next month.
* #■ * *
“Cut Shot” : The N.S.W. tennis bosses at
least believe in giving the . rising generation
a chance in inter-State games, whatever may
be the case with the cricket people. The
team selected to meet Victoria in Melbourne
next month includes not only Hopman and
Crawford, who have proved their worth, but
such comparatively new arrivals as Sproule
and Donahoe. Schlesinger, Jim Willard,
Cummings, Kalms, G. R. Williams and A.
Willard are also in the team.
i'fi * * ']•
“Flam”: Betty Nuthall has contracted to
appear in a British film in the character of
“a happy sports-loving English girl,” as the
cable neatly puts it. The Nuthalls have
one characteristic which seems to be insep-
arable from film stars: the capacity to value
one’s services when it comes to signing con-
tracts. No one who recalls the despairing
efforts of C. B. Cochran to get the guardians
of the infant phenomenon to fix a price for
her engagement as a professional will doubt
that for a minute. Cochran is hardened in
the game, but he confessed himself beaten,
and staggered away a dispirited man.
“Baseline”: Vincent Richards is playing
exhibition matches in Japan, where he is
meeting leading amateurs like Harada.
Tennis addicts in this country are asking
whether it will not be possible to induce the
American, who was ranked third to Tilden
and Johnston till he turned pro., to come
from Japan to this country. Australian
rules permit the meeting of amateur and
professional in such games, and as well as
dealing with our best amateurs the young
man could be pitted against Anderson. The
visit would in no way clash with the brief
tour of the Frenchmen, but it is to be feared
that the time at their disposal to make up
their minds about such a revolutionary pro-
posal will be all too short for the Australian
authorities.
The Ins and Outs
The Maoriland team which did •sd well
in England will commence a match/ at Syd-
ney C. G. on Friday agginst a Ma State
XI with a strong backbone,.,of Test-match
players. The AH Blacks struck a Very wet
season in the Old Country, but made a much
better showing jthan did the South 'Africans
in similar circumstances 15 years/ago. Iv. C.
James, the ’keeper, particularly impressed
the Englishmen, as also did Blunt, the all-
rounder, and I )acre, a most attractive bats-
man. Now that Queensland no longer needs
the Ma State's fostering care, it Avould be
an excellent thing for the game if Maoriland
were put in the vacant place. Sheffield
Shield “gates” on Friday, Saturday, Monday
and Tuesday would be a capital way of
establishing the closer relation.
* * * *
“Third Man”: A. J. Richardson has taken
up coaching duties in Perth for the W.A.C.A.
South Aus. will miss him in the Sheffield
games this season ; last year he headed the
State batting averages with 67.44 for 9
innings and a highest score of 232, made
against Queensland at Adelaide. Arthur's
batting average for the Sheffields, since the
war is 39.18 for 60 completed innings; his
aggregate is 2351 runs—good going for a man
who came into big cricket comparatively late
in life. In the same period he has taken 84
wickets at 43.27.
❖ ifc ❖
“Aigburth”: The possibility of Arthur
Richardson ultimately qualifying for Lanca-
shire recalls the fact that the county of the Red
Rose, though growing plenty of good cricketers
itself, has a strange liking for imported goods
—perhaps it is the Freetrade influence of
Manchester. In addition to Kermode, O’Keefe
and Macdonald from Australia, there has
rarely been a Lancashire XI without at least
one player from outside. At random one
recalls Crossland, the old-time thrower, and
Johnny Briggs, who both hailed from Notts;
Alec Watson, another fast cliucker, from
Scotland; lefthander Arthur Mold, also in
the doubtful class as a speed merchant, a
Nortliants man; Frank Sugg and Albert
Ward (that fine batsman of Stoddart’s 1894-
95 team), both Yorksliiremen. And there are
others.
SPORTING ITEM.
“Ladybird's form was very disappointing.”
“Splice”: C. E. Pellew, of the 1921 Aus-
tralian XI, has returned to Adelaide club
cricket with an eye on inter-State honors, if
he can pick up his old form. A fine batsman
and a brilliant field, Pellew. if he can come
back, should help to make up in some
measure for the loss of A. J. Richardson.
He is North Adelaide’s skipper.
* * H*
“Shrewsbury”: The decision of Charlie
Macartney to retire from first-class cricket
has aroused a lot of protest from grandstand
critics who have never themselves undergone
the strain of season after season of exhibition
games in Australia and abroad. That Mac-
artney will be a great loss to Australian
cricket goes without saying, but the obvious
remedy is to push forward promising young
players rather than urge the veterans to
carry on to the last gasp. Macartney is
almost as good as ever with bat and ball, but
lie is 42 —well on for a cricketer of any
calibre —and has been playing in the very
“DIVINE SERVICE.”
front rank of Sheffield Shield and inter-
national cricket for 20 years. During that
period he has had at least one serious break-
down in health—it kept him out of the Tests
against Gilligan’s men—and lie is well
advised to close his ears to so-called admirers
only too willing to overwork the willing
horse.

Sydney, and 20s. per day, with no Sunday
remuneration, while at home. The new scale
will apply not only to Sheffield Shield
matches but to second-eleven inter-State

Sydney; for this affair it was originally pro-
posed to pay only 10s. a day, while the
second strings were to draw 15s. An amend-
ment in favor of equal work equal pay was
carried.
* * * *
“Lansdowne”: Possibly the 1902 Aus-
tralian XI deserves to rank as the greatest
of all the sides this country has sent to Eng-
land (B. 20/10/’27) if only because it won
the rubber against some of the finest cricket-
ing talent that the Old Country has ever put
into the field. Consider some of those that
England had to call on in those days—Jack-
son, Ranji, Maclaren, Jessop, Palairet, Hay-
ward, Abel, Tyldesley, Braund, Hirst,
Rhodes, Lilley, Barnes. Whether Australia
wasn’t a little bit lucky in winning said rub-
ber is another question, for in the first Test
(at Edgbaston) it was hard up against it
when the weather intervened. The scores
were: England, 372; Australian, 36, and 46
for 2 wickets. The second Test was aban-
doned when 2 English wickets had fallen for
102. The third was the turning-point, Aus-
tralia winning comfortably by 146 runs. The
fourth and fifth were epic contests with the
results in doubt till the last ball was bowled.
Australia won one by 3 runs and lost the
other, when Jessop made 139 in 75 minutes,
by 1 wicket. These, the two closest finishes
in all the history of international cricket, tell
how well matched were the opposing sides.
A contest of giants, verily.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Amateur Pro.”: In January teams of
golfers from N.S.W. and other States will
journey to, Maoriland to take part in the
match for the Kirk-Windeyer Cup. Tim
N S.W Coif Council has decided to hand
each N.S.W. representative £4O towards his
expenses. The ordinary amateur practice
is for expenses to be naid by the controlling
body; an allowance, fixed at ss. per day by
the Amateur Federation, is added for per-
sona] expenses, in the case of footballers, at
least In Britain, amateur golfers are ex-
pected to pay their own expenses entirely
when taking part in tournaments, and the
same is true of America. The laws of
amateurism and professionalism are strictly
defined in golf, and fhe decision of the
N.S.W. body seems in' direct conflict with
them.

“Colonel Damurize”: Someone has been
writing to the papers advising that every
golfer should have a moving picture made of
himself while playing. It is argued that
study of such a picture, showing
the player in all his strokes, would
be of vast benefit to him in correct-
ing his faults, especially it' it were
compared with films showing such
champions as Bobby Jones in
action. The idea, though good, is
capable of improvement. The pic-
ture might be taken by one of those
new-fangled devices which record
the songs or words of the person
photographed. Such a study of a
golfer attempting to emerge from a
cross bunker or a bad lie in the
rough would be of inestimable use
to a retired curate.
Jjc }jc
“Ploughman”: There’s nothing
like golf for curbing the pride of the
haughty and pulling down the
mighty from their seats. Consider
the story of how D’Alvarez, the
beauteous Spanish tennis champion-
ette, and Colonel Ivingscote, once a
British Davis Cup representative,
made their debut in serious golf in
a tournament at Epsom. In a
tennis tourney the pair would have
made any of the other competitors
appear as crushed worms; but in
this case they.were contemptuously
given a handicap of IS strokes.
They took the first hole in 10, and
then seem to have gone quite off
whatever game they ever may have
possessed. Details are meagre, but
it is stated that the pair gave up
scoring after the first few holes, the
lady having hit “a number of long
drives” —evidently clean out of the
court every time.

“Brassey”: Touching that new
golf ball (B. 13/10/'27), the cable
reports a match between leading
British amateurs and pros., to test a
ball composed of gutta-percha and rub-
ber — a sort of compromise between the
old-time “gutty” and the modern rubber-
core article. The team using the new ball
beat their opponents using the rubbercorc.
It was found that the new ball took as much
as 50 yards off a hard-hit drive, though it
Was possible to lay mashie-piteh shots with
much less difficulty, the new ball being not
so lively. Putting was found to be easier
also, and while the users of the rubbercore
were generally able to reach the green "with
a pitch shot for the second, those with the
new contraption found themselves once more
called on for the fast-vanishing second
“wood” shot through the green. The ball
is 64dwt. lighter than the present standard
ball, and 3dwt. lighter than the old “gutty.”
which suggests that it will take some jamb-
ing into a strong headwind.
# * * *
“Ananias Minor”: If it be true that en-
vironment has a strong influence on charac-
ter, particularly that of the rising genera-
tion, I am looking forward with some appre-
hension to the development of the next
generation of Canberreers, Canbeerites, or
whatever may be their correct designation.
Canberra is infested with professional poli-
ticians, a class whose dexterity with the
truth has long become a commonplace. If
that were not enough, golf lias been intro-
duced, and so the insidious sapping of the
foundations of veracity thereabout promises
to become accelerated. The process began
with a nine-hole course. This is to be
expanded into a full nineteen-holer, unless
the Drys have their way and cut out the
final green. It only needs the permanent
establishment of prohibition in the Territory
to make conditions perfect for the develop-
met of the Compleat Liar.

“Divot Digger”: At Kensington (N.S.W.)
links recently a player driving off from the
tee killed a swallow in the air. The feat
has been equalled at cricket, both by bats-
man and bowler; a swallow was the victim
in both cases. Such a happening has yet to
be reported at tennis, ping-pong or even
bowls, to say nothing of League football.
Car and Cycle
“0.H.V.”: Increasing popularity of small-
powered English motor-cycles was demon-
strated at Sydney’s Speedwmy Royal on
Saturday night. Five competitors bestrode
Douglases, four pinned their faith to the
A.J.S. and one steered a Raleigh. The only
American machines were three Harley-David-
sons. Cecil Brown, the American, who
• last season created a stir by his daring
riding of high-powered Indian twins, is one
of the converts to the little A.J.S.

MARTIN DITCHER’S TRIUMPH.
Mr. H. L. Tooth, Murami Irrigation Settlement, on
the Murrumbidgee, writes:
“The ten acres of rice field yielded me 140
bushels. I consider the use of the Martin Ditcher
reduced the cost of ditching and check bank work
by 50 per cent.”
The photograph shows a section of Mr. Tooth's
fine field which was recently described in the Agri-
cultural Gazette. Many other rice farmers are
now using the Martin Ditcher.

Car and Cycle
The Royal Automobile Club of Australia
held a reliability touring contest on Saturday
over the 116f-mile route from Sydney to
Jenolan Caves. Nineteen cars competed;
they were divided into classes A, B and O.
Points were allotted at the rate of 100 for
general reliability, as shown by punctuality
from control to control, and 50 each for
petrol-consumption and hill-climbing. First
in fuel-cor sumption was F. M. Beck’s 990-
c.c. Fiat, with a run of 9.15 miles on the pint
of fuel allowed, or a ratio of 73.2 miles to
the gallon. In class B, 1501 to 3000 c.c., F.
D. Johnston’s 2297 Vauxhall ran S.65 miles
on the same fuel allowance, equalling 69.2
m.p.g. Class C, 3000 c.c. and over, with a
fuel allowance of one quart, was headed by
F. A. Parle’s 4224 Vauxhall; the big car
covered 13.1 miles on the allowance, or a
rate of 52.4 m.p.g. In each class cars had
to maintain a minimum speed, under penalty,
the figures being set at 20 m.p.h. for cars
up to 18001b. weight, 22 miles for those up
to 35001b. and 23 for cars over 35001b. Coast-
ing was permitted. The hill-climb was
1 3-10th mile, with an average grade of about
1 in 12. The fastest time was done by
F. A. Parle’s 4224 Vauxhall, 2min. 10 l-5sec.
* $ * *
“Ziff”: F. J. Dean’s round-Australia
journey by car has some unusual features.
Dean and his wife left Sydney on July 10,
going via Brisbane, N.Q. and the N.T. He
wagered that he would have neither shave
nor haircut till he reached Sydney again,
and no spare parts were carried. The pair
arrived at Perth on October 12, having then
covered 7400 miles, and set out again to
accomplish the remaining 2800-odd miles to
their starting-point.
sis sis sis s|s
“Marathon”: Yet. another long non-stop
record has been put up in America by a
motor-car, in this case a Whippet roadster.
The car was driven over 12,000 miles of
country roads, 31 drivers taking turns at
the wheel, for 720 hours. The petrol aver-
age was 31.11 miles to the gallon, while only
seven quarts of lubricating oil and seven gal-
lons of water were consumed. Even allow-
ing for the fact that the drivers, as in all
these stunt tests, were experts at getting the
utmost out of the car at the least cost in
fuel, etc., the accomplishment was a good
one.
“Supercharger”: Billy Lamont, the N.S.W.
motor-cyclist, had a field day recently at
the Davis Park Speedway, one of Bris-
bane’s latest dirt tracks. Going out in
four races, he won each in brilliant fashion,
riding a A.J.S. His first win was
in a heat of the First Division handicap, in
which he started off scratch, giving away as
much as six seconds. The distance was a
mile, four laps of the quarter-mile track, and
his time was 85 4-5sec. The first semi-
final was cut out in 85 3-5see, and the final
in 84 l-5sec; average speed for the three
runs, a fraction over 421 m.p.li. In the
Silver Gauntlet, of which he is the holder,
Lamont started in the final only, lie won
again, in 77 2-5sec. for the mile; average
speed, 46§ m.p.h.
“Ball Race”: The foolproof condition of
the modern internal combustion engine has
been well evidenced by a road test undergone
by an Ariel motor-cycle. English-made. The
objective was the beating of Chamberlain
and Levine’s non-stop record of 3908 miles
made during their trans-Atlantic flight. The
Ariel, with changes of drivers and observers,
ran continuously for 5004 miles, pull-
ing a side-car into the bargain, without a
hitch or readjustment.
* * * *
“Clip”: Hubert Opperman came into
notice again on Saturday, when he rode
from Sale to Melbourne. 127 miles, in 6hr.
19min., knocking lhr. 44min. 5sec. off his
own standing record for the distance. A
curious happening was the suspension for
two months of H. Moody, the N.S.W. rider,
who made second fastest time. It was
alleged that he did not try to go for the
fastest time in the final sprint, though his
finishing figures were only 55 l-5see. worse
than Opperman’s. The actual winner of the
race was J. Boyd, of Oakleigh (Vic.) club,
who had 45min. start. He took 6hr. 51 min.
45sec. to get home.
Miscellaneous
The Waratahs received their first cheek
on Saturday, when they met a powerful side
from the great London clubs; it included
nine international players. The game, which
ended in a scoreless draw, was played at the
R. U. ground at Twickenham, in pouring
rain, before 30,000 spectators. The British
forwards excelled in dribbling rushes with
the wet ball, though it is stated that the
result was a true reflex of the game. Law-
ton and Ross were in magnificent form for
the tourists, while Sellars, the English inter-
national full-back, also covered himself with
glory. In the mid-week match against the
North of Scotland, the visitors won by 21 to
15, after leading by 15-0 at half-time. They
played a forward short in the second half,
Finlay being injured, while Wallace was
also crocked. The team’s record to Saturday
is 10 wins and one draw, with 190 points
scored to 44.
“Six Beat’’: South Africa wants the Aus-
tralian swimming representatives at Amster-
dam, whoever they may be, to break their
journey at the Cape and there take part in
competitions. The break of voyage is against
an Olympic Council rule forbidding visiting
teams to take part in contests en route to
the Games ; but there is nothing to prevent
the party dropping in on its way back. The
Australian authorities are willing, if that
suits the Afrikanders.
“Leo Lear’': An Australian equivalent
to swimming the English Channel has been
accomplished by Ted Taylor, a young Eng-
lishman now working in the Port Fairy
(Vic.) district. Surfing on the coast near
Yambuk, Taylor calmly set out with the
tide, unattended and unannounced, for Julia
Percy Island, whose inhospitable coast lies
six miles off shore in the Southern Ocean.
He managed to land on a shelving rock, and
when the tide turned struck out for the
mainland, which he regained nine hours
after his starting-time. This lone swim on
a storm-swept coast, the water being little
above winter temperature, should rank high
among Australian achievements of the kind.
Taylor intends repeating it to settle disputes,
if any.
* * * *
“Six Beat’’: The annual report of the
N.S.W. Swimming Association makes cheer-
ful reading, especially that portion of it
which tells of the organisation’s intention to
concentrate on the development of young
swimmers. The only way to accomplish this
is by intensive coaching, and that means the
employment of a full-time coach. Tih,e
report makes no mention of this course being
taken, but the association has made some
progress on the road to increased efficiency
by deciding to employ a salaried secretary.
Modern sport organisation of the sort has
gone far beyond the stage where the most
capable and efficient of honorary secretaries
can do himself and his trust justice, and
the same is true of amateur coaches. One
of the fundamental causes of America’s out-
standing success in games and athletics is
the recognition of the advantages of pro-
fessional coaching and supervision. The
same trend is noticeable in Continental ath-
letics, and even in conservative England the
professional coach, once confined to cricket
and Soccer football, is making his way into
every branch of athletics. The Swimming
Association is well off, as such bodies go—
it has a credit balance of over £BOO for the
season—and would be well justified in
launching out in the direction suggested.
* ❖
“Splash”: The Ma State’s Surf Life-
saving Association, a body of which Aus-
tralia has a right to feel proud, lias issued
its 19th annual report. Entirely an amateur
organisation, it derives its working funds
from a small capitation fee on affiliated mem-
bers; last year there were 2332 on the active
membership list and 1891 listed as other than
active members. A Government subsidy
brought in £2OO. In 192(5-27 1041 persons
in difficulties were rescued from the surf;
since 1906 13,820 lives have been saved. The
L. K. S. MACKINNON, chairman of the
V.R.C. and owner of Star d'Or.
association has a world-wide reputation.
Requests for advice were received last year
from England, France, America and South
Africa.

“Ike Meßagg’’: It warms one’s heart, to
read in the cables that the splendid tradi-
tions of the profession are being upheld, cost
what it may, in Britain. Someone who lias
been gathering statistics on betting at the
tin-liare industry there refers to one famous
track as being the punters’ paradise. They
simply can’t lose, it appears, yet night after
night the dauntless Tommies stand up and
uncomplainingly shower largesse upon per-
sons who, in most instances, are perfect
strangers to them. One bookmaker is said
to have lost £l2OO on one race and £5OOO on
the one following. It is a magnificent exhibi-
tion of altruism, and we constantly see it
repeated here. Meeting after meeting it is
the sad duty of those devoted young men who
chronicle the stern facts of racing for the daily
papers to point out that the Ring has again
lost heavily—has, in fact, had one of the worst
settlings since the one before that. Yet these
C. T. OLIVER, one of the successes of the
Maoriland XI which is to begin a
match a gainst N. S. Wales on Friday.
brave fellows persist in their ill-appreciated
task of enriching the punting community.
How the poor devils find the money to keep
going, and come up again with a cheery
smile for more after every disastrous knock
back, is one of the arresting features of the
situation. The only inference can be that
they are supported by rich and eccentric
relatives in Fiji. /'
* it * *
“Robbo”: While “sports” and wowsers are
awaiting a decision from the new N’.S.W.
Government on the tin-hare question, the
Hogan Government has definitely pronounced
against betting on the business in , Victoria,
though there is no objection to it as a spec-
tacle. Queensland, where all sorts of places
are being feverishly converted into tin-hare
arenas, has said something to the same
effect, though .there is some doubt as to
whether the McCormack Government will
stick to its guns. In Westralia also the Col-
lier. Government has declared its hostility to
the introduction of the “sport” as a gamble,
although it has been remarked that a pro-
minent Labor politician is interested in a
tin-hare co. Whippet-racing with betting
used to be popular on the goldfields. Grey-
hound-racing without betting wouldn’t last
two months, in Westralia or anywhere else.
❖ ❖ * #
“The Grafter” : Queensland was the happy
hunting-ground of the spieling brotherhood
before Col. Sec. Tozer swept them out
of open existence with his Gaming Act. The
lads operated anywhere—l have seen roller
sweat tables running busily at an inter-
state football match—but their chief delight
was in the annual race meetings at the hig
country towns. It was at Charters Towers
that the industry met with its Leipsic, so
to speak, the subsequent legislation supply-
ing the Waterloo. That was in 1891, if
memory serves. The “talent” were so out-
rageous in their methods that strong resent-
ment was aroused. A brutal assault on a
Towers man by a spieler who had taken
him down fired the train. A big crowd of
miners and others went for the spielers with
fists and feet. They fought back savagely,
but were outnumbered, and in spite of the
assistance the police gave them many were
badly manhandled, while all the gambling
apparatus on the ground was smashed to
bits. The mob chased the fraternity into
town and dealt it out to them in their hotels
and at the two railway stations the city
then boasted, intercepting battered “guns”
who were trying to escape on the trains to
Townsville. Many of the routed army
walked all the way to Sellheim station, on
the Burdekin, a distance of about 12 miles,
in their anxiety to get away from the en-
raged gol'dfielders. After that the game
never really held its head up again in the
Towers and neighboring parts, and there was
no resistance to the measure which put it
beyond the law.
Business. Robbery, etc.
“C.Q.” : The Federated Furnishing Trades’
Society in Melbourne has east a polite but
effective brick at the Brighton City Council.
It passed a resolution commending the
Brunswick Council for installing Australian
pianos in its new hall. Then it passed
another resolution commending the Bruns-
wick Council’s action to the residents of
Brighton. Their council has just bought
three German instruments.
* * * *
“Tassie” : The Speck could do with a lot
more self-help. Towns along the N.-W. Coast
import butter, flour, honey and jam from
Vic. and elsewhere, although they possess
their own flour mills and butter factories,
and jam foundries are sprinkled over the
island. Dried blue peas, branded “Choicest
Tasmanian, v are imported from Vie. Tassy
also produces excellent honey, but the main-
land product is . old at most stores.
# * * *
“Ester”: Australia’s wine trade has won
a commanding grip of the British market.
Board of Trade returns for September show
that 783,311 gallons of Australian wine were
imported, as against 221,196 from France
and 483,163 from Portugal, hitherto the
Commonwealth’s most dangerous rival in the
heavy red section. Spain, which has also
■specialised in the heavier wines, exported
only 205,323 gallons to Britain. Aus-
tralia’s increase, in comparison with Sep-
tember of the previous year, was 651,000
gallons, foreign wines decreasing by 318,109.
The figures indicate that Winston Churchill’s
much-criticised tariff adjustments, coupl'd
with the Federal Government’s export
bounty, have been of great assistance to the
marketing of the Australian vintages.
$ Jj« 'A* : i :
“Dalgoimily”: A good bit of droving is
reported from Queensland, where the Jack-
son brothers, with 12 hands, took 2500
cattle from Moreston Downs, near Camoo-
weal, to Fitzroy Vale, in the Rockhampton
district, a distance of 1400 miles. The mob
comprised 1250 bullocks and the balance
mixed cattle, a conglomeration which always
spells extra difficulty for the drover; it
was delivered, with a loss of only 18 head.
51 months after starting. The success of
the trip points to excellent judgment in the
choice of routes that led through the
drought-stricken Central-West, plus a splash
of good luck.
* * * *
“Momokeni”: If the new plant invented
by 11. E. Cotter, of Lismore (N.S.W.), is
successful, the problem of finding a profitable
use for skim milk will be solved, and the
extra twopence a pound yielded by the curd,
added to the butter return, will help to
lighten the cocky’s burden. The whey left
after the casein has been extracted is still
good food for calves and pigs. There is
a world demand for casein for various pur-
poses, and if separating machinery can be
made available to small farmers on reasonable
terms, as is proposed, a new Australian
manufacturing industry may be the outcome.
!|! * * *
“Seaplane”: There would be much less
need to spend money on re-afforesting if
we conserved the forests that Nature is
still giving us. Consider what is going on
in the Pilliga scrub, in the big western
pine belt of N.S.W. Its area is nearly
1500 square miles. Cypress-pine grows
so thickly that a sulky cannot be driven
through, and in parts a horseman cannot
pass. The pine re-afforests itself. Places
I knew as open paddocks 20 years ago
are now covered with pine. There are
a few forest reserves in the area, but the
Lands Department seems to prefer to throw
it open for settlement, although most of the
soil is only fourth-class or lower for sheep
or husbandry.
* * * *
“Adsum” : Some of Lang’s chickens roost
in States other than N.S.W. Many Federal
awards have their basic wage fixed on the
aggregate figures of 20 country towns, and
the rising costs in N.S.W., and in a smaller
measure in Victoria, are factors in pushing
up wages in S. Aus. and Westralia, where
the cost of living tends downward.
* * * *
“Ivwinana”: Some of our Australian
telegraph lines are hardly fit to hang clothes
on; hence the frequency of the intimation
on the display-board at Sydney G.P.0.:
“Traffic to will be subject to delay
owing to landline interruption.” Most of
the North Queensland lines, instead of being
copper, are constructed of high-resistance
galvanised wire, and I have seen the Table-
land line, along the Barron Range, sagging
on to the ground for miles. Thursday Island
has been telegraphically isolated four months
this year. Cooktown for two mouths, Cairns,
with half a dozen lines, for three weeks, and
the Gulf stations for two months. And
it doesn’t require the aurora australis to
put them out of commission ; a healthy thun-
derstorm in the vicinity of the lines will
do it.

The dedication of new St. Luke’s on
Friday marked a triumph for the C. of E.
in Sydney. The original hospital, an old
home in Roslyn-street, Darlinghurst, to
which wings had been fitted, was opened
about eight years ago, and, in addition to
equipping it and carrying on business all
the time, the energetic committee worked
to such effect that it can now look with
pride on an imposing five-storey building
that runs the width of wdiat was the garden
of the old home. The new hospital teems
with devices for saving nain and eliminating
noise. For instance, no bells go whirring
or clanging through the corridors. When you
want your nurse, you push a button at the
head of your bed. Up goes a light and
simultaneously a light pops up in the ward-
nurse’s quarters and in the matron’s depart-
ment. Another feature are the two recovery
rooms, where operation patients are
harbored till the worst throes of the anaes-
thetic are over. Chief Justice Street made
the opening speech in an immense marquee
that spread between the two. buildings ; over
a thousand of the hospital's supporters
hearkened to his words, and later joined
in the dedication ceremony. Premier Bavin
took his first salute as skipper of the State,
and chairman of the board of directors A.
M. Hemsley handed over the gold key with
which the C.J. opened the new hall of heal-
ing. And in the general chorus of con-
gratulation over work well done such con-
sistent helpers as Dr. Kate Knowles, Mrs.
Gordon Wesche, the Stephens, Mrs. Shep-
lieard Laidley and Mrs. Roystone Davey
were not overlooked.
The Arts and Crafts Society seems lately
to have made a leap forwardand the exhi-
bition', always one of the end-of-the-year’s
charms, is this October a positive ravish-
ment. Color rushes to the gaze in luscious
waves from the time the threshold is crossed.
Here shawls and scarves in peacock tones,
in rose, in gold and a hundred shades
between, turn one alcove into an inland sea of
rippling magic. And this sensuous delight
in color pervades the two galleries in the
Education Department’s building, where the
show is being held. The blue and orange
of a Newman vase worthy of a line in the
Song of Solomon radiate to the red lac-
quer cups that are the pride of the Innes
display. Some gay baby chairs and tables
with nursery-rhyme pictures, a goose-girl
stencil, a set of tiles telling the story of
Billy Bluegum, and a great deep toy-chest,
its blue paint providing a cheery background
for a 'whole arkful of animals, are of special
interest to rich fathers and mothers and
uncles and aunts.
Lady de Chair exhibits a screen on which
peacocks walk among roses worked in rib-
bon on a neutral background. The ribbon
used, it is said, had originally bound bou-
quets thrust on the Vice-reine during her
daily round. A new form of modelling called
Latex is shown by Miss Blair on some
candle shades of black wood. The ground-
work is the sap of the rubber-tree, which is
colored and modelled on to the article to be
decorated. Bryam Mansell’s Venetian lamp,
bronze as to body and jewel-set as to shade,
might have graced a Doge’s palace. An
eye for color and design is shown by Miss
Dalgarno. and to Joan Mackenzie goes the
honor of being the only one of the exhibitors
to charm the National Gallery trustees into
a purchase.
The Rose Show at St. James’s put a pretty
border around last week. You realised as
you walked among the gold and white and
crimson beauties that, no matter how arid
the city itself might be, from north, south,
east and -west hundreds of gardens were
blowing their sweetness over its ways.
The season’s blooms - are particularly fine,
a special charm seeming to linger around
those from the North Shore line, from Con-
cord and from Croydon. Great single roses
(the old hedgerose up to date) reminded one
of a Morris decoration, and a line of an
old song by the man _ who thought that
beauty could revolutionise the world came
dancing to the memory. “Two red roses
across the Moon,” it sang, even while two
judges searched tile petals for flaws and gave
their decisions in desiccated tones.
All Sydney's musical critics and singing
teachers seemed to be in the King’s Hall on
Monday night to listen to Molly de Gunst.
The attractive girl with the Roman neck
has the dramatic fire, the stage ease and
the vocal equipment of an operatic star. Sue
comes from the studio of Madame Christian,
and has been hailed as the star who will con-
tinue the meteoric flight of Amy Castles.
The Greeting to the Hall of Song, from
“Tannliauser,” and the “Aida” arias whirled
the audience into a storm of enthusiasm in
which Bertie Kelly. Gerald Marr Thompson
and just-returned Roland Foster were vehe-
ment elements. The voice is a dramatic
soprano, of pure and ringing tone. Its owner
comes from Orange, and is not yet 21.
The splendors of Joyce Ludowici’s wed-
ding to Dr. Kenneth Addison are still pro-
viding table talk among the reaches of Lane
Cove. Joyce is the daughter of the Charles
Ludowicis, of Bay Road, and the young
man, who physics Waverley, is a son of the
Philip Addisons of West Maitland. The
pews of St. Stephen’s were filled with guests
for the knotting, which was done by Padre
McDonald, with Hugh Paton to tighten up
any loose ends. Joyce, who billowed up the
aisle on father’s arm, mingled ivory moire
and tulle in a picturesque old-world frock
and secured her Iloniton lace veil with a
hairband of rhinestones. Her fragrant
flowers were white lilac and lilies of the
valley. Four maids in green and gold, a
trail of gold roses and mignonette cascading
from their floral armlets, followed the prin-
cipal lady. Three stalwart groomsmen and
the brother of the bride, who was best man,
stood by the groom. Over 2. r >o guests met
afterwards at the Wentworth at the bidding
of Mr. and Mrs. Ludowici.
Still another wedding, and as it was a
Pymble alliance roses were everywhere in
the picture. They were spilled beneath the
feet of the bride and groom as they left St.
Stephen’s kirk. Deeply red they bloomed
in the crook of Molly Murdoch’s arm as she
transferred herself from her father’s care to
that of Alexander Sverjensky. Molly is the
daughter of the R. R. Murdochs and Mr.
Sverjensky is a Russian pianist who settled
in Sydney a year or two ago. White georg-
ette and silver lame allied to a rosy cloud
of tulle train formed the pretty wedding gar-
ment. Genial George Portus, who lias god-
fathered the musician since his coming to
Australia as accompanist to Lipkovska, was
the toastmaster at the subsequent cheerio.
This is a little picture of the mildest-
mannered man who ever looked a bandit m
the eye. He is Alexander Clark Mackay,
and he has earned his daily bread along the
untrodden ways of the Manchurian forests,
in the wildest parts of New Caledonia, in the
jungles of Sumatra and Borneo —among
tigers, elephants, panthers, head-hunters and
robbers. From
the Outer
Hebrides a
small Ii ig h -
lander r a n
away to sea
before he was
12. Then his
people appren-
ticed him 1 to
a ship, and
he joined up
with the old
Loch line. But
the Alexander
in him wanted
new worlds
t o conquer,
and one night
when his boat
was loading
teak the
you n gster
slipped into
a canoe and
went back up the river to stay among the
Burmese for seven months. Then back to the
sea again and so down to Victoria, where
finally he became a lumber-man and a seeker
of big timber. Since then he has made in
Australia such home as he has had. Now he
knows the forest countries of China, Russia
and the Far East as few men know the
town they were born in.
The Austral Scot’s last great adventure
was with bandits in Northern China. His
tale of being captured, held for ransom and
his final escape turns a Wild West movie into
something like a nursery tale. Not that he
grows expansive about his exploits. It is the
cut and thrust, the sudden shot in the night,
the queer thrill above the collar when you
find a hefty dyak looking towai’ds your head
with affection —it is such things which the
shy Highlander holds back (he is the shyest
man this Letter has met for a year) that
makes his tale so gripping. At home in
Uranga, on the North Coast. Mr. Mackay is
a Justice of the Peace! He mistrusts his
pen, but friends have persuaded him into
writing something; but he is still sure there
is not enough in it for a book. And the
writing man would make 20 out of a tenth
of it.
Jean Macpherson slipped into matrimony
quietly, but with all the trimmings neatly
adjusted, last week. St. Mark’s at Darling
Point blessed the vows, and the Queen’s
Club rejoiced sedately over the family
gathering. Jean is a daughter of Mrs. Mac-
pherson, of Double Bay, and the groom.
Richard Griffin, hails from Clermont
(N.Q.).
Marjorie Burkitt, of Mosman and not so
long ago of Tamwortli, chose the local St.
Luke’s for her linking up with Alan Peberdy,
of Merriwa. Marjorie, in orthodox white
satin, was given awav by her father, mar-
ried by her brother Emra and cheered on-
ward by a wedding-marcli played by young
brother Marcus —the musician who has
never seen the instrument he plays so bril-
liantly. A sister of the bride and friend
Marie Robins ’maided in spreading skirts
of powder-blue and rose. Marjorie, on the
maternal side, dates her Australian ancestry
back to one of the early English regiments
in Australia, and on the other side to one of
the men who helped to make the King's
School what it is.
Herewith is Nellie M. Scanlan, a Maori-
land penwoman about to descend on London.
For her is claimed the distinction of having
been the first
woman sub-
editor of a
daily news-
paper in her
native country.
She was the
only journalist
from Maori-
land at Uncle
Sam’s Disarm-
ament Differ-
ence, and
while in
America per-
petrated a n
outspoken
tome, “Mirrors
o f Washing-
ton.” Return-
ing to the land
of the moa, she
sub - edited a
weekly illus-
trated, and
while on that job went up and down from
Auckland to the Bluff with the Royal Yorks.
A bishop all the way from Wagga (he
was Dr. Dwyer), with Father Wogan, tied the
knot that binds Mae Dougall, of Centennial
Park, to Dr. Urban Ley, of Wagga, eldest
son of Dr. George Ley, of Warragul (Vic.).
White lilac and pink roses decked St. Mary’s
for the greeting of the bride’s white chiffons
and Chantilly lace. The fragile wedding gar-
ment was fatshioned with a yoke and hem of
chiffon embroidered in orange blossom, and
this design in sliver thread and satin was
again seen on the draped chiffon train.
Bride’s sister Helen, Evelyn Moore and
Noreen Bolger mad; a demure entry in peach-
pink georgettes embroidered in gold and sil-
ver thread topped by pink crinoline poke
bonnets. Nearly one hundred guests sat
about the great marzipan-columned cake,
adorned with love-birds, at the Ambassadors,
where Mrs. Dougall did the honors in black
and fawn of handsome cut.
Another pretty girl who sought St. Mary’s
during last week was Dorothy Snudden. A
maid of the mist in her tulle and georgette,
she whispered her responses in the ear of
Leo Berndt, of Adelaide. The Wentworth
spread the wedding meats.
A score or so head of sheep were ex-
changed on the Rialto last week for the
diamond that now flashes in the engagement-
ring of Muriel Moses, of Edgecliff. Walter
Kidman, of the Cattle-king family, was the
lad who fitted on the circle.
Another ring event causing a thrill in
Woollahra and Rose Bay is that of Lesly
Johnson, of the first fashionable subbub, to
Dr. Osborne (Fob) Wilkinson, of the second
address. Wedding bells early next year.
For months past pretty Margaret Osborne,
only chick of the Stuart Osbornes, of Darling
Point, has been the centre of interest in
every big smart mob. Was she or was she
not engaged to the young man, Ellis Feilding
Jones, who was always with her? Margaret
said she was, but the family maintained com-
plete silence on the subject. However, the
parental blessing was spoken in public one
day last w~eek when Mrs. Osborne gave a
luncheon party at the Australia to celebrate
the announcement. Margaret is a pretty, slim,
blonde creature, and one of the most taste-
fully and expensively dressed flappers in
Sydney.
Lady Cowan, an overseas visitor with a
fine profile, is doing a revised Penelope act.
She is following the British flag over seven
seas with her Ulysses; and in every coun-
try she touches she knits another thread into
the bonds of Empire. She has been lunched
by the Society of Women Writers, has visited
the Empire Service Hostel for Married
Migrants, has received the accolade of the
Queen’s Club, and even in that sanctuary
has preached her gospel of co-operation with
Britain in the marketing of Empire goods.
To-morrow she is booked to discourse to the
Feminists in their own fastness.
Monsignor King smiled like a cherub the
other afternoon when 800 of the faithful
poured into the Ambassadors to help him
pay off the debt on his new church at Stan-
more. Nor was the gate-money all that
swelled the fund. Lucky packets and guess-
ing competitions were other money-spinners.
A pretty recognition of the help the press-
girls had given to his party was the bestowal
of a dazzling shoulder posy upon each. Ex-
Mayoress Cecilia Walsh was president of the
cabaret, and present-Mayoress Mrs. Mostyn,
in plumbago-blue georgettes, was the guest
of honor.
Diggers who enjoyed the hospitality of
Mrs. Helen Cunliff, of The Croft, Amble-
side, in the Lakes District, will regret to
learn of her death last week in Sydney.
The English lady made her first visit to
Australia a few years ago. principally to
see, on their native soil, the young men she
had helped to mother during Blighty fur-
loughs. On her first tour she stayed in
almost every corner of the continent, visit-
ing the homes of returned soldiers who were
doctors and farmers and grocers and den-
tists. She returned to England with the
intention of coming back again. This she
did a few months ago, and for two of them
she lay in St. Vincent's Hospital. One
daughter, Mrs. Massey, mercifully reached
the sick mother a fortnight before the end.
The intrepid lady, who was 84, was buried
at South Head.
A tremor of excitement ran along Point-
street, in Pyrmont, one afternoon last week.
The littlest ones of the street were in the
party, or rather they were the party, for
wasn’t it their kindergarten the Governor’s
lady was opening? The new building repre-
sents another £2OOO spent by the Kinder-
garten Union in its determination to teach
the kiddies of the hot and arid streets to
play before life makes them work. Her Ex.
and daughter Elaine, who supported her. flew
the family’s favorite green in hat and frock.
Elaine unfurled the flag before the unblink-
ing round eyes of babyhood, and Mrs. Jack-
son. -who is vice-president of the outpost
committee, unveiled the photograph of the
late Mrs. Francis Anderson, that splendid
pioneer of kindergarten work in Sydney.
Positively gallons of fruit-cup and ice-
cream went to keep the P.L.C. cabaret from
boiling on the grilliest afternoon of
last week. With the mercury all hot and
bothered around the century, the girls from
the Scots’ colleges at Pymble and Croydon
trickled a seemingly endless stream into the
Wentworth to do their bit for the Children's
Hospital. For years the girls have kept a
cot going under the Royal Alexandra roof,
and the cabaret was towards the thousand
pounds which they are raising to endow it
for all time. The committee work was evenly
balanced between girls from each college,
and by four o’clock the treasury wore a
healthy and collected look in spite of the
heat wave.
Women, women everywhere, and not a
drop to drink —that was the Kosciuskan fea-
ture of the entertainment at the King’s Hall
arranged by the National Council of Women
and the League of Nations’ Union. Professor
Griffith Taylor, accompanied by a smail
Fuji-Yama of lantern slides, took the com-
pany through the Not-so-far-East; and
another at the feast of reason and unreason
was Lady de Chair, who handed out the
prizes given by the National ' Council for
essays on the work of the League of Nations.
Elaine supported her, and Professor Mac-
Callum’s lady acted as Mistress of Cere-
monies. The film “Pen versus Sword” wound
up the wild corroboree.
Frances Aitken, of Equity Park, Berri-
gan, claims the distinction of knowing every
golf links of note in England and Scotland.
Among her homew r ard-bound kit is a brand-
new set of golf clubs from St. Andrew's. She
is now leaving for the Continent, and returns
by the Moldavia in time for Christmas in
Australia.
Although she visited her native land only
once during the long years of her residence
in Australia, the just-dead Mrs. Higin-
botliam remained a true daughter of France.
A few years ago one of the French com-
munity, departing on a visit to Europe, asked
Mrs. Higinbotliam if there was any little
commission he could transact for her in
France. Her request was for him to bring
back a small box of French soil. This he
did, and the box was guarded more jealously
than if it had contained gold. “When I die
bury it with my heart,” the French-Austra-
lian entreated her children. And at the
last moment her youngest daughter placed
the soil within the coffin.
The patriarch of a family, in the empti-
ness of his years, being then 76, sought and
won the affections of a young woman of 25,
and promised to settle £5 a week on the
subsequent infant. Up to the time of his
death (in the young woman’s arms) the
amount w T as duly paid. Then the executors
of the estate closed down on the payments.
Here the wronged heroine of the old melo-
drama would have folded the babe in a
faded and torn shawl and staggered out
starving into the snowy night. The heroine
of 1927 gathered up a sheaf of documents,
closed the door of her suburban bungalow,
stepped into her car and drove to a lawyer.
And then, after the family linen had been
well -washed for the benefit of the multitude,
the case was called off and the executors
paid up.

Consider the
Battery in the
“DAGENITE” case
As a battery—a battery that WORKS—
the P. & R. is wonderful. Something
extra—something extraordinarily good—
you get in the P. & R. is its “Dagenite” case.
“Dagenite” is a patented, fireproof, acid-
proof, leak-proof, weather-proof, almost
unbreakable material. It looks like
ebonite. But it’s many times as strong.
You need no crate around it. It neither
rots nor corrodes. It will resist jolts, jars
and crashes which would reduce ebonite
to splinters.
And that is not all about the P. & R.
Every piece of it—plates, separators, lugs,
terminals, connectors, paste, the whole
thing —has been made to do its job. The
P. & R. is a BATTERY.
Before you buy any battery, write for
special booklet to Direct Factory
representative, John Arnold, Degreaves
Buildings, Degreaves Street, Melbourne.

Our Henley-on-Yarra festival was almost
entirely spoilt from the point of view of
the flapper by a wind so eliill that top-coats
simply had to be worn. The gayest of
sleeveless frocks and the brightest of para-
sols had been got ready for the occasion, but
the chill wind didn’t let up till four o’clock,
when it was too late to matter. A few Spar-
tan maids let the crowds upon the banks
glimpse their frocks and millinery, which
matched the cushions and colors of canoes
piloted by blazer-clad youths, but the lasses
looked very chilly. Fortunately there was no
rain, and though the attendance was under
records the banks were crowded with people.
English visitors on the houseboats were
charmed with the whole turnout. There
seemed to be bands everywhere on shore,
and portable gramophones everywhere upon
the face of the waters. The G.-G. and the
Somerses came from Moonee Valley races to
have a peep, and seemed loath to leave.
Gathered on a sheltered reserve under the
plane-trees were many cot-cases from the
Military hospitals, and the soldiers appeared
to enjoy the outing.
Prizes for decorated canoes were gained by
one representing a basket of flowers and
another the goose that laid the golden egg.
The houseboats made a cheerful showing.
The Mayor’s was most picturesque—a very
long pontoon with tent-like erections of
bright blue and gold at both ends and win-
dow boxes of flowers all round the boat.
Mayor Morell and his lady, she a study in
black and white, entertained among others
Lady Lawley and her niece Miss Leatham,
visitors from the Big Smoke, Rear-Admiral
and Mrs. Napier, the Harry Chauvels, Mrs.
Norman Brookes, wearing a mole cape over
a mauve frock allied to a biscuit felt hat,
Mrs. A. E. Boyes, Mrs. C. W. Nodrum and
Mrs. Carty Salmon. The president of the
Henley Association, H. M. Strachan, and
Mrs. Strachan had their houseboat picked
out in white-flowering tea-tree, peach blos-
soms and roses, and their guests at afternoon
tea included Lord Stonehaven, Governor and
Lady Somers and George Fairbairn and his
lady. The Amateur Sports Club for its
houseboat chose huge daffodils set in dra-
peries of two blues as the color scheme. Mr.
A. J. Shepherd, senior vice-president, and
Mrs. Shepherd did the honor’s. Among visi-
tors on the Uni. houseboat were Solicitor-
General Garran and his lady, the J. R.
Cochrans, the Chancellor of the Uni. and
dozens of profs, and their womenfolk. Band
concerts, fireworks, illuminations along the
river and lawns and dancing made up the
night’s programme, which drew big crowds
though ’twas like Lapland under the stars.
Moonee Valley was the Mecca of punters
on Saturday. The Cup meeting drew a
mighty crowd and a good percentage of
womenfolk, but the dressing, owing to the
penetrating breeze, was on the wintry side.
The course looked beautiful. Trees and lawns
were vividly green, roses of every shade
hedged the members’ enclosure, and the
sweet-peas were at their best. The G.G., the
State Governor and Lady Somers, she in
ensemble covering of leaf-green with a felt
hat of the same hue, had luncheon
with the committee, the chairman, Alis-
ter Clark, playing the host. Roses
from the Clark garden decorated the
damask and included the latest Clark inven-
tion, a pinky bloom known as the Sunny
South. Mr. and Mrs. R. Edkins, down from
their Bananaland acreage for the Cup, were
also guests of the committee at lunch.
Amongst those on the lawn were Mrs. O.
Lempriere, wearing a smart ensemble of
black satin with a touch of beige georgette,
and a dash of reseda-green on her black hat,
Mrs. Fred Thiel, who arrested the eye with a
short black bodice above a black and white
striped satin skirt, topped by a large black
hat, and Mrs. Harry Rosenthal, who wore a
black cape faced with black and white spotted
calfskin. Amid many handsome furs, Mrs.
Norman Bayles’s mink coat got special atten-
tion. Mrs. Alister Clark was all in blue of
pervenche tone, softened with grey fur. Mrs.
L. K. S. Mackinnon and Miss M. Officer wore
extremely attractive grey tweed tailored
suits with harmonising millinery. Mrs. Ivan
Gutmann chose an ensemble of delicate green
tone with a velour hat of the same color.
Artificial posies were in favor-—the larger the
more fashionable, though real lilies of the
valley seemed to be the most popular.
It seems to have been this way. The
Morning Post was losing money heavily,
and the Guardian people in Sydney thought
it might presently fall into their hands and
serve as the very good foundation for a Mel-
bourne morning paper to share exes, with the
Smith daily in Sydney. Keith Murdoch, of
the Herald, seems to have thought so. too,
so he recommended his co. to buy the Post
and thus probably keep the Guardian out of
the field. With only the Age and Argus as
competitors, the HERALn-owned Sun-Pic-
torial is making remarkable progress.
At the Wattle one night last week the
black, blue and gold of the Presbyterian
Ladies’ College was added to the decorations
for the Old Collegians’ annual dinner. Ena
Smith and Constance Colman did some artis-
tic place-cards. The O.C.’s president, Essie
Mollison, who received a book and a posy,
hostessed in a gown of jade green sprinkled
with gold beads. Anne Fortune, lion. sec. of
the P. L. C. Club, was on hand in a charming
frock of lavender and mauve tones. Mrs.
T. Purves, president of the club, had a
veiling of silver lace upon a blue gown, and
Principal William Gray’s wife wore black
georgette. Mrs. Paul Wischer. Doris Moore,
Mrs. J. 11. Mirams, and Drs. Georgina
Sweet, Margaret Anderson and Esme
Anderson were others who toasted their old
school.
The 37th Battalion’s ball at Malvern Town
Hall on Thursday night was a cheery affair.
The Mayor and Mayoress of Malvern were
present, Mrs. Wilinot wearing jade blue
veiled in black. Mrs. Symons had glistening
rhinestones on a tourmaline-pink robe, and
blue and silver was the choice of Mrs. Guinn.
Mrs. Horder’s cosmos-pink frock had a
shower of crystal upon it. The Navy was
represented by Rear-Admiral and Mrs.
Napier. The Harry Chauvels, Major Edrie
Henty, Major-General Blarney and his ivife
and a host of other military folk were wel-
comed by the commanding officer, Lt.-Col.
Savige, whose wife was arrayed in blue.
Malvern’s new Mayor, 11. G. Wilmot,
and his wife began their term with a garden-
party in the Malvern Gardens. Unfor-
tunately the first hot northerly of the sea-
son put in a boisterous appearance, and
there was an anxious moment when all
hands had to man the ropes to prevent the
tea marquee from emulating a parachute.
The Mayoress’s gown of beige georgette was
shaded by wide-leafed blue millinery. Mel-
bourne’s Mayoress Morell, who stood with
the host and hostess during the hand-
shaking, wore an ensemble suit of black and
white, with white plumage on a black hat.
For the first time in Melbourne musical
history a woman, and a young one at that,
has conducted grand opera. The slim girl-
ish figure wearing a black glistening gown
that waved the baton at the Princess Theatre
on Saturday night was the Contessa Filip-
pini, Australian-born and an ex-student
of St. Vincent’s College, Sydney. The com-
bination of Australian and Italian artists
held the rapt interest of the big audience.
Count Filippini produced “Rigoletto” well,
and the costuming was elaborate and effec-
tive. The IS-years-old prima donna, Car-
mencita Mascagni, whose home is in North
Queensland, is a distant connection of the
composer of “Cavalleria Rusticana.” She
sang Gilda’s part very sweetly and looked
very attractive in a boy’s suit of black vel-
vet in the last act. Among the first-nighters
were Italian-Consul Grossardi and his wife
and daughter, Mrs. Richard Fitcher and
her small son, Eileen Castles, Mrs. H. S.
Iv. Ward and Dr. Bartolini. There were
many posies for the principals and the fair
conductor at the curtain’s fall.
The Repertory is being robbed of another
clever young player, Bessie Williams, who
makes her professional debut as the lisping
flapper in “All
the Town’s
Talking.” She
is an old
Grammar girl,
and afterwards
entered the
Con., where she
became one of
pianist Goll’s
pupils. The
idea of a stag±
career came
during a year
abroad with
her family, but
they discour-
ag c d firmly.
Finally on re-
turning home
she joined
Gregan M e-
Malion’s band
of players, and
climbed the
ladder from super to juvenile. She is a
daughter of the T. 11. Williamses of Mal-
vern, and her mothrr's hobby in youth was
amateur acting. Lafayette made the picture.
Mrs. W. M. Finley was principal per-
former at the Music Club’s latest evening
at the Lyceum Club. She sang a group of
songs by Bach; and Mrs. Arthur Streeton’s
violin and a grand piano, operated by Louise
Gargurevich, were hoard in pieces by Mozart,
and Bach. Mrs. Finley’s frock, white at the
top, blended into rose-pink, and was lined
all over with crystal. Mrs. Streeton wore a
robe of white silk lace with flowing sleeves,
and Miss Gargunwich was also in white,
with opalescent floral adornment. The pro-
gramme being short, there was time before
coffee for a peep at the art-craft show of
Lyceum Club members that is occupying
the rooms just now. Mrs. Godfrey Cass,
Mrs. Ernest Scott. Mr. and Mrs. Corrio
Gardner, Mrs. J. C. V. Behan, Rita Hope,
Katie Liddell and Mrs. Fleming Dunstan
were there. Secretary Muriel Campbell
thanked the performers.
At the Austral Salon’s latest monthly
meeting the programme was arranged by
Mrs. Beckx Daly (Edith Harrhy). The
p'anist-composer, who looked radiant in her
glistening lemon-toned frock, played Chopin
after giving a leeturette on the man and his
work, and later sang some of her own set-
tings of humorous verses for children. Jessie
Batchelor and Norman Bradshaw sang; Max
Bruch’s Scottish Fantasia was nicely
bowed by violinist Hamilton Bateman; a
couple of ’cello pieces were contributed by
Sheila Macfie, and Margaret Kerr added a
Milton Hayes monologue. There were posies
of roses for the artists.
Beatrice Henty believes in the wooing that
is not long a-doing, and her altar-date with
Graham Frederic Blandy, whom she met
recently at Honolulu, is fixed for next month.
The bride belongs to one of Victoria’s best-
known families. A Henty statue looks
across the ocean from Portland’s headland, a
tribute from the townsfolk to the early
settler’s energy. Beatrice inherited his
practical mind, and during the war years
she had charge of the Town Hall organisa-
tions, and dispensed comforts and smiles to
departing soldiers. The man of her choice
acted as A.D.C. to Governor Davidson of
N.S.W., in which State he settled down to
grow wool.
This is Edith Harrhy, pianist-composer,
just returned after a visit to England, where
she had some
concert stage
successes. She
got her musi-
cal training
in the 01 d
Dart and was
a favorite
pupil of Lan-
do n Ronald,
who had a
special medal
struck to re-
w a r d her
prowess. As
a composer
she has many
lyrics, a light
opera, and
pieces for
p i a n o f o rte
and violin to
her credit;
she is an
a c c omplisliod
pianist and a singer of merit. Her link
with Australia is a husband, W. C. Beckx
Daly, of this city, and two small children.
She is billed to give a recital at the
Assembly Hall on November 7, with Ger-
trude Alger violinist and baritone Arnold
Ashworth. The Dayne Studio made the
picture.
Alma, daughter of the F. B. Roches, of
Brighton, who married Dr. Frank Donovan
at St. Patrick’s Cathedral on Friday night,
was a study in lace and pearls. White silk
lace flounces touched her ankles and lovely
Venetian lace floated as a train, from a
brow-band of pearls. Pier two maids fitted
nicely into the picture in pale pink tulle and
georgette frocks, with felt hats to tone.
There were rejoicings at No. 9 after the
ceremony.
The Lyceum Club’s exhibition of the
work of its arts and crafts members was
opened by Dr. A. L. Kenny. Sixty pictures
were hung, the most notable contributions
being those of C. Southern Flinn, Jessie
Traill, Elma Roach, Dora L. Wilson and
Elsie Barlow. Mrs. Moran was represented
by some charmingly-painted china, and Mrs.
Charles Courtney’s enamels in the form of
pendants and buckles, also a mosaic-like pic-
ture of the Madonna, are beautifully done.
Elsie Barlow and others did good business
with dainty little pictures and calendars
intended as Christmas greetings.
Mrs. Vale Gilfillan’s pictures of flowers,
with a few landscapes and portraits, will
cheer the walls of the Queen’s Hall until
the 22nd. Mrs. Thomas Baker, in a gown
of mole georgette and blending millinery,
gave the -show a kick-off, receiving a posy of
Duchess of York pansies from the artist.
Mrs. Gilfillan (she’s better known in art
circles as May Vale) is still wearing an arm
in a sling as the result of an accident, but
a large throng .of first-viewers, many of
whom had a buying look in the eye, cheered
her up immensely.
Mrs. Tolhurst is bringing her daughters
Shirley and Susie back on the Orama in
time to eat the Christmas goose under their
own rooftree. Amongst their baggage are
some trophies won abroad, for both girls are
keen golfers and have taken part very suc-
cessfully in overseas tournaments. Susie
not only holds Victorian honors, but has won
inter-State laurels as well.
The W. G. Spowers couple have arranged
to wander through India, and will leave after
the Cup meeting. Ellison Spowers is tem-
porarily deserting her lion. sec. job with the
Victoria League to keep them company.
When the party returns Ethel and Rosalind
Spowers, who will keep house during their
absence, intend to board a liner which will
land them in England.
Phyllis, youngest daughter of C. W. Elder,
of Yunong, Berwick, has said “Yes” to
Kenneth Selby, whose parental home is at
Malvern.
Norman Falkiner’s handsome wife stepped
ashore from the Cathay with daughter
Nancy after an absence of eight months
spent in England and France.
Winifred Guy, an English girl who travels
round with a collection of posters depicting
the scenic glories of the Empire—she lec-
tures about ’em —has .worked her way to
these parts, and is looking for a hall, but so
far she hasn’t been able to rent one; they’re
all occupied by art shows. She will exhibit
English posters here, but in Blighty she talks
about Australia.
Mrs. J. G. Latham opened the additions
to the Y.W.C.A. Holiday House at Seaforth
the other day. Mrs. H. A. Woodruff spoke
of the activities of the Y.W.C.A. in China
and Japan. Mayoress Morell was a guest.
Mrs. George Blackwood and her daughter
Jean Russell are returning from their Con-
tinental trek in the Mooltan, which is
scheduled to land its passengers in time for
the Cup. Accompanying them are Major
Arthur Yencken, of the Foreign Office, and
his wife, .who was Joyce Russell.
Folded up, the latest notion in parasols
looks like a bouquet of artificial flowers. It
is covered entirely with rosebuds or other
small blooms, the stalks of which dangle
all round the edge as a fringe. The handle
folds up in small compass, forming a sort of
holder for the posy. One of the prettiest of
these sunshades is covered with field flowers
—daisies, poppies and cornflowers. The price
of the vanities is about 1\ guineas, and
they are not likely to be flaunted on Fleming-
ton lawns in any great quantity unless the
weather grows less capricious.
Australians who returned last week from
overseas bringing Christmas gifts and pre-
sents of the latest novelties in London and
Paris found there is still nothing new
under the sun; for the posies and other
etceteras of smart dressing were all well
established here already. Not only is this
so in the way of clothes, it is the same in
house decoration. At any rate, another trav-
eller declared that Liberty’s, in the Big-
Smoke, was featuring material which was a
replica of curtains she had purchased in
Brisbane a year before. Even the quaint
mechanical toys seen on the steps of St.
Martin’s. London, are to be purchased in our
own Collins-street on the pavement.
Some notes from Canberra: —
The Stonehavens have taken possession of their
beautiful home at Yarralumla, and the family, especi-
ally the children, seems well content. Small Ariel
attends St. Gabriel’s Grammar School during
the week, and invites her young friends to Govern-
ment House during the week-end to play in the
flower-bespangled nursery or in the great gardens,
luxuriant just now with green lawns, flowering shrubs
and spring blossoms.
The Social Sendee Association entertained the
staff of the Home and Territories Department and
their womenfolk at a dance in the Ainslie School
buildings, >vhich were nicely decorated. Chief-
Commissioner Butters was there with his lady, and
spoke words of welcome.
Ladies’ Day on the golf links was punctuated by a
sudden shower which drove the players into the
lounge of the Canberra, where they attempted to
forget their disappointment over tea and cakes. But
the sky soon cleared and play was resumed. Mrs.
Bruce was one of the keenest players.
One night last week Lady Stonehaven entertained
a small party to dinner at Government House.
Among the guests were Robert Garran and his lady,
the Priministerial Bruces, Commissioner Butters and
his lady and Commissioner Harrison and his
daughter.
“A.G.M.’s” notes from London: —
Lorna and Toots Pounds are wearing very
effective dresses designed by the Princess Yourievsky,
whose concert singing has made her popular in
another way. A model from one of Augustus John’s
pictures is the motif— a high waist with full skirt
and tightly-fitting bodice; the back of the skirt
touches the ground while the front is just to the
knees, the hem line being uneven. Another idea
seen lately is an old fashon revived —the trouser
skirt. It is much pleated and shows no sign of
bifurcation until the wearer walks.
Sara Allgood, of Irish Players’ fame, met with a
serious accident when the taxi in w’hich she was
riding collided with another vehicle. She was taken
to St. George’s Hospital, and, though making a good
recovery, cannot play in “The Girl Friend” for a
while.


The Combination of Farmer and Engineer
designed the Westinghouse Plant.
Before Westmghouse Light and Power Plants were ever
placed on the market they were required to measure
up under long, long months of tests in actual farm
service. In addition to unusually severe laboratory
tests to prove the stamina, ruggedness and durability
of every part of the plant, a large number were
installed in the homes of unbiased farmers who had
agreed to subject them to extra-hard usage in everyday
farm service and make regular reports of results.
These plants remained on test by farm families for
more than two years, and were called upon to render
just as reliable service as you will expect from your
farm plant. In other words, the Westinghouse
Company felt that if Westmghouse Light and Power
Plants were to be absolutely satisfactory for farm use
the farmers needs must be considered above every-
thing else.
These farm tests proved that Westingbouse Plants
were fundamentally right, and, largely through the
suggestions received from the families who made the
tests, the exceptional simplicity and ease of operation
were attained. Truly, therefore, the farmer himself
helped to design Westmghouse Plants, which, as a
result, are to-day making life lighter, easier and happier
for innumerable farm families.
If you would enjoy the advantages of greater light and of abundant electric
power for dozens of operations both inside and outside the house, instal a
Westinghouse Farm Light and Power Plant.

Chief Justice Blair opened Australian and
New Zealand Authors’ Week in the Girls’
Old Normal School, with Prof. Stable, Mayor
Jolly and J. J. Knight, of the Courier, on
the platform. The Chief Justice quoted
poetry and made flattering references to Mrs.
M. Forrest and Colin Bingham, local poets.
Mayor Jolly was jocose, and Prof. Stable
spoke in the best Uni. manner of the need
to encourage literature in our midst. A
number of interesting old books, MS., papers
and pamphlets were on display in the
Authors and Artists’ Society’s section. Lec-
tures by such well-known critics as Firmin
McKinnon, Dr. F. W. Robinson, Dr. Cum-
brae Stewart, Colin Bingham and H. A.
Longman were features, and various women's
clubs and societies gave afternoon teas in
the annexe.
The Authors and Artists’ special evening
brought forward songs by Australian writers,
Doris Waraker, M. Forrest and Meta
McLean being amongst the women repre-
sented. There was a collection of pictures,
including four lent by Mrs. Crooke which
have not been previously shown ; studies by
the famous poisoner, Wainwright, who was
a Tasmanian convict when the paintings
were made. There were also examples of
the work of some of our best Australian
artists, and the illustrations which J. M.
Stevens did for her own book “The Mac!
Painter” were of special interecst.
St. John’s Cathedral staged the marriage
of Roy Christensen to Trixie Reid, of
Clayfield, with a background of arum-lilies.
The bride, in ivory mariette, a bordered net
veil and orange blossoms, carried mauve and
white orchids. Gwen and Doreen Reid and
Nancy Wright ’maided in iris-mauve and
silver, carying delphiniums and orchids. The
National saw the feasting.
Passed out, after eight years’ plucky fight,
Mick Fihelly, who was “Redcap” of the
Inky Way. He became paralysed after pneu-
monia, and had gone from hospital to hos-
pital, always grimly determined to recover,
but the unequal strife finished this week.
Eileen, fourth daughter of the C. J. Bra-
bazons, of Maxwelton, and Bernard Clark,
of East Talgai, Warwick, are among this
month’s newly-engageds. Both are well
known, and both clans are jubilating.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Mrs. Trethowan’s party to say good-bye to
her daughter, Mrs. Tim Morrison, who left
with her father by the Chitral to return to
the Soudan, was the big social event of the
week. Raspberry-red was the color of the
gown of crgpe de Chine chosen for the occa-
sion by the hostess, and the floral chiffon
worn by Mrs. Morrison, girlish and graceful,
was trimmed with apple-green and honey-
colored bands. Roses shared honors with
lilies and stocks in the decorative scheme,
and all the very best people were there.
Mayor and Mayoress Franklin celebrated
their golden wedding recently at their home
in Adelaide-terrace. Guests, mostly members
of the family, included two very old friends,
Mrs. Shaw-Walker and Mrs. Rutter. Mrs.
E. B. Sinclair, one of the daughters, made
the two-tiered wedding-cake. There were
flowers and streamers, letters and telegrams,
and many golden gifts, including a wristlet
watch sent by the City Fathers.
A cabaret dance at the Green Room Club
was enjoyed by a large crowd. A bright
programme included a character dance from
“China Girl,” by Norma Brennan, who also
contributed a'character song. Tess Smalpage
figured in a song and ballet, and there was a
character dance by Mavis Epstein and Phyllis
Hope Robertson.
James Linton, pictured here, is the son of
J. W. R. Linton, art master of the Perth Teclf-
nical School,
from whom
the son re-
ceived his early
art training,
showing such
promise that
18 months ago
he went to the
Old World to
study sculpture
and painting
in the Central
School of Art,
London, and
in Julian’s
Academy,
Paris. He re-
turned to Perth
lately, after a
very successful
career abroad,
and purposes
to set up a
studio in Mel-
bourne.
Dominions-Secretary Amery and his wife
have arrived and have been given many wel-
comes. Mrs. Amery was entertained by the
National Council of Women and other
women’s organisations of which the name is
legion. The rendezvous was the Karrakatta
Club and the proceedings informal, by request
of the guest of honor.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
There was a friendly invasion of town by
the country during Show week and things
have been very lively. The Show itself was
a great success, being blessed by perfect
weather, though that gave the pastoralists,
who had been praying for rain, less pleasure
than otherwise might have been the case.
The O’Gradys were entertained at tea
by the president, C. E. Webster, and
Mrs. Webster, Margaret O’Grady appear-
ing in a honey-colored coat and blue
hat. His Ex. opened the Women’s Industries
Hall, the gift to the association of L. M.
Shoobridge. To Mrs. M. L. Moore goes the
credit for the organisation that resulted in
a very creditable opening display of various
examples of women’s work, domestic and
technical.
The girls who got up a Cat Dance in Show
week did the thing properly, at the Imperial,
where cats figured everywhere in the decora-
tions, invading even the lamp shades. Most
of the pictured pussies were the work of
lion. sec. Joyce Walker. Margaret O’Grady
looked fresh as a daisy in light green and
silver lace. Some of the frocks showed the
quite high waist, while others were longer in
the bodice than ever, tight and rucked. The
girls of the committee wore tulle “pussy”
bows round their necks.
Mrs. C. I. Dick is a Tasmanian writer

Christmas Tales,” comes out just in time
to catch the Christmas mail for friends in
the Old Country, and makes a charming little
gift. Mrs. Dick is pictured here by McGuflie.
The town and country bachelors who gave
a Show-week dance at the new Trocadero
roof-garden scored a big success. About 150
young things enjoyed the fun. Margaret
O’Grady’s fairness was set off by her dance
frock of black velvet severely plain in cut.
Refreshments were served in the bay of the
dance hall, and the night, though cool, was
fine enough to make the open air enjoyable.
NORTHERN TERRITORY.
Darwin.
We had a chance to see ourselves as others
see us when Commander Bennett of the sur-
vey ship Geranium gave a lecture at the
Stadium illustrated with photographs and
cinema films which he had taken. There
were moving pictures of Cobliam’s arrival at
and departure from Darwin, alligator-shoot-
ing on the Adelaide River, surveys made on
the Barrier Reef, industrial scenes in and
round Darwin, native corroborees and several
glimpses from aeroplanes. The local scenes
evoked the most applause, well-known resi-
dents, as they moved to and fro on the screen,
being loudly hailed by the dusky gods in the
gallery. The bush hostels got a substantial
cheque as a result of the entertainment.
The Geranium sailed a few days after the
lecture. She is going out of commission for
lack of funds, so a much-needed national
work is to be stopped. British boats that
traverse these lonely and dangerous waters
must still depend mainly on charts drawn
by Matthew Flinders and other early navi-
gators. while alien fishermen have the use of
up-to-date charts made by their compatriots.
The Darwin races drew a big crowd. The
committee has improved and enlarged the en-
closure, which promises some day to be a
really pretty place. The tote was well
patronised, dividends ranging from 13s.
to 38s. for each 10s. invested. Adroit,
owned by Mordy and trained by Parer and
Casliman, won th~ two principal races, the
North Australian Handicap on the Satur-
day and the Darwin Cup run on the follow-
ing Tuesday. Mrs. Weddell, wife of the
Administrator, decorated the horse. Entries
for the Katherine races are numerous, far
surpassing those of Darwin.
Donald Mackinnon, editor of the North-
ern Standard, has been fined £2OO for
libel. He published a paragraph comment-
ing on the conduct of M. C. Clapp, and a
jury found it wasn’t justified. At time of
writing the fine has not been paid, and the
poor pressman is in gaol.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
The opening of the summer season was
celebrated by the Adelaide Rowing Club at
their clubhouse on the Torrens, with the
committee and Mr. and Mrs. J. H. Gosse
(he is the club’s president) to do the honors.
Unley Park croquet-players have got into
their stride, too. The club’s new president,
Mrs. B. Merlitens, declared the lawns open,
and bridge and dancing were side-lines.
The Amerys’ visit gave time for little
social racket. For him there was lunch at
Government House and dinner at. Parliament
House, with the interims devoted to inter-
views and conferences and a glance at one
or two of the nearest institutions; for her
a private luncheon and a small and informal
dinner at Government House. Both visitors
were at the Mayoral reception at the Town
Hall, where she found a good many familiar
faces (she has a truly royal memory for
people and their names), and collected a
good deal of information as to our methods
of dealing with migrants—-especially women.
She is dark and slim, and very enthusiastic.
The Sliannon-Lucas wedding was mostly
silver and blue —silver lace and palest pink
and parchment-colored georgette for the
tall dark bride (Mavis, elder daughter of
the Claude Lucases of Anlaby), blue tulle
and georgette for the bridesmaids (the
bride’s sister, Katherine, and Bryony, small
daughter of the H. H. Duttons) and a blue
smock for Geoffrey Dutton as page. The
wedding was at St. Peter's College Chapel
-and the toast-drinking at the South Aus-
tralian, where the bride’s mother was blue-
clad, too, and the tables a dream of spring
with flowers that came largely from the
Anlaby gardens.
Horn from England include the
Way Campbells and Mrs. Colley. Mrs. Camp-
bell’s son. Dr. Edwin Crozier, and his wife
are due in a week or two.

Dim idea in your “Twilight”.... Bellerive: What a
picture Meldrum could paint of it!
Midnight in the lonely bush,
When the misty dewdrops fall.
There’s solemnity in the wafting
Of the distant mopoke’s call.
Silvered by the shining moon
The shadows of the trees
Prance like phantom spectres
To the magic of the breeze.
Softly from the waving grass
A reptile from its lair
Basks upon a fallen log
In the open moonlight air.
’Tis the bush where veteran rovers,
Poor, wearied and o’ercast,
Brood in sad reflection
O’er memories of the past.

But so many knew R.L.S. personally that few who
merely rewrite what they read are worth while....
A.L.M.: “Spring, dear wonderful spring” made a
wonderful spring—and got there S.V.W.: All
excellent until you come to your policy, and then
you are as vague as the rest. Try again. .. .G.R.D.:
Good feeling in it; but it thuds into commonplace
phrasing.

THE INKY WAY.
“Riwaka”: Some recent pars, about re-
jected items bring to mind a Bulletin
poster that looked to me as if it had strayed
from the “Answers to Correspondents”
column. I sent in three contributions for
one issue. Not one of them was printed, and
the poster accompanying that number
announced: “The week, with all the dull
things left out.”
On the Monday morning after the Caulfield
Cup the Argus had the following headlines
over a cable :
TEXTILE INDUSTRY.
DEPRESSION IN BRITAIN.
NEVER BEEN SO BAD.
The depression in Vic. for the preceding 3(1
hours was due to Textile never having pre-
viously been so good.
“Q.N.” : Quaint are the new uses of news-
paperdom? The other morning Melbourne
Sun Pictorial published a coupon, entitling
the bearer, on presenting it at any
metropolitan tobacconist’s, to purchase a
packet of fags—a new brand —for one penny.
Most of the shops had sold out within 10
minutes of opening; the whole 10,000 packets
had gone by 9.30 a.m.
Item from a Vic. country paper:—
Sir Joseph Duveen, a London picture-dealer, has
purchased two pictures from the Duke of Westminster
for £200,000. One is a portrait of Mrs. Siddons. For
many years a Mr. Siddons, said to have been her
husband, was a patient in Beechworth Lunatic Asylum.
There is virtue in the “said to have been”;
books of reference give 1773 as the date of the
lady’s marriage.
“A.G.M.” (London) : A home for sick
journalists during convalescence has just
brightened up the Inky Way of England. Mr.
Thomas Parkington has presented the Oak
Hill estate, near Ipswich, to the Institute of
Journalists, and it has just been opened by
the Lord Mayor of London. There will be
accommodation for nearly 30 beds when the
place is complete.
The last sheets for this year’s Christmas
Bulletin, to be published on Dec. 10, have
just been sent to the printer. It is inter-
esting—at any rate, to those inside —to watch
the trend of each year’s big number as it
takes form. This year the tendency has been
towards longer short stories: it hasn’t been
deliberate ; it has simply happened that the
best of the stories offered during the year
were longer than usual —a few of them would
have had to be mercilessly cut to get them
into the space available in an ordinary issue.
The fiction will be the outstanding feature
of the number; this would naturally be
expected from the quite remarkable improve-
ment in the quality of the stories offering
during the last couple of years. There will
be half a dozen of great merit in the Christ-
mas number —including one by Katharine
Susannah Prichard and another by a com-
paratively new writer, Henry Mostyn. The
latter’s “The Ghosts of Grogan” is a very
fine thing.
“Wingella”: Thrust and parry fro::’
successive issues of the Northern Territory
Times (the correspondence, not the advertis-
ing columns) :
Sir, —-Just a caution on account of some low person,
or thief, helping himself or themselves to my small
heap of short sawn firewood. If he, she or they con-
tinue taking or trying to take it away, they will
probably be taken to the hospital or the police
station or the cemetery, as I have resolved to keen
a loaded gun in my house. Of course nobody knows
who I am, but whoever takes my wood will probably
soofi know if they continue to take it or try to do
so.— Bill.
Dear Sir,—l didn’t take Bill’s firewood and I ain’t
going to say who did. He ain’t got enough there to
make a coffin for himself now, anyway, so he better
get some more instead of talking about shooting me,
if he means me. It won’t be no good me saying I
didn’t take Bill’s firewood when I’m dead, so I’m
going to say it now.—Jim.
“Topee”: Died at Melbourne October 15,
aged 01, Harry William Hamilton, founder
and proprietor of the Rabaul Times. He
was born in England, served his apprentice-
ship to the printing trade in M.L., and was
engaged for nine years in the N.S.W.
Government Printing Office. He served with
the N.S.W. Bushman’s Contingent in the
Boer War: went to German New Guinea
with the A.N. and M.E.F. in 1915, and later
succeeded journalist J. Ling as Government
Printer there. This office being abolished
when the Territory came under civil adminis-
tration in 1921, H.W.H. purchased and en-
larged the plant, started the Times and built
up a prosperous business. His death
occurred during a southern trip. He was one
of the most popular men here of the old
“Tropicals”; there will be condolences for
his widow and daughter from all parts of
the Mandated Territory.
“Hotham”: The organisation behind the
Melbourne Herald has swallowed one more
of its rivals in the Morning Post, which
has consented to give up the ghost for a
consideration after a two years’ struggle.
The Post was a morning paper which,
though published in the metropolis, had aspi-
rations to ride on the harvester and direct
the storming of the local legislature by the
Country party. The dream was never to
be realised; the Post has now been absorbed
by the big Flinders-street combine which
calls itself the United Press and controls a
dozen daily and weekly journals, from the
Herald to a boys’ paper. The particular
absorber in this instance is the Sun News
Pictorial, which, less than three years ago,
underwent the same swallowing process it-
self, when the Herald crowd reached out
for it. The Post’s losses in the two years
of its existence are said to total £130.000.
The buyer is to pay £31,000 for all assets
save book debts.
“Machete”: There will be a melancholy
interest for Inky Waymen who publish books,
or propose doing so, in the recent intimation
that Britain intends to deduct income-tax
at the rate of 4s. in the £ from all pay-
ments made to authors resident outside
Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This
will not only hit up quite a few Australian
writers, but will bring shrill complaints from
the prolific “Irish School,” just now so much
to the forefront. Few will derive much com-
fort from the consideration that if the author
is paying income-tax in the country of his
residence on the money from which the deduc-
tion is made in England, he may put in a
claim for repayment, for getting a refund
from a taxgatherer is about as simple a
proeess as pulling one’s leg out of a shark's
mouth.

—
Tlie patter of a soaking downfall realistic-
ally produced was matched by the flow of
startlingly realistic language when Somerset
Maugham’s “Rain” was introduced to the
Sydney Criterion on Saturday night. It is
a morbid story, only relieved from muddi-
ness by the remarkably fine acting of Mar-
garet Lawrence, and, in a lesser degree, of
Louis Bennison. An assorted group of people
find themselves marooned in the living-room
of a flyblown “hotel” in Pago Pago just as
the wet season starts. The Reverend Alfred
Davidson, who has made it his life’s business
to teach the islanders to wear trousers and to
convince them that what they have been wont
to think happiness is just plain sin, wrestles
in his sternly fanatical way for the soul of
Sadie Thompson, but, in spite—or because—
of having previously eschewed all the lusts
of the flesh, even making a marriage that is
“purely spiritual,” his prayerful contact with
the lively female finally lands him in a love
passion as volcanic as his fanaticism. The
sinner is not as bad as he thinks, being really
a crude, lower-class girl who likes her fun
but has her reservations; and when, after
Davidson’s religious thunders have convinced
her that she must make atonement, he enters
her room at midnight and shows her that he is
not entirely saint, she pours out a bitter
stream of contempt for the beastliness of all
men. But there seems a gleam of happiness
ahead for Sadie when Davidson, appalled at
his own headlong fall from grace, commits
suicide.

The play gives Margaret Lawrence a
chance to display a wide range in talents.
After getting full value from the comedy
touches in the flamboyant Sadie of the
opening, she passes with wonderful effective-
ness to the intense emotions of the girl
struggling against the cruelty of religious
fanaticism. The actress’s voice is not a
strong one, yet, although she is reduced to
actual hysterics in the intensity of the
second act, her work is always convincing
and never overstrained. At the outset Louis
Bennison makes the missionary rather
a confirmed wowser than a thoroughfaced
fanatic, but, later, as the distraught man
who refuses to admit the fleshly tempta-
tions until he is himself overcome by them,
he meets every requirement. Wallis Clark’s
representation of the indolent trader-philo-
sopher, Joe Horn, is superficial, the energy
of his speeches being quite out of keeping
with the sluggishness of the character.
Leslie Victor is a pleasant man-of-the-world
medico; Barrie Livesey makes the U.S.
Marine Sergeant, O’Hara, a live person; and
John Fernside is a perky Quartermaster
Bates. Jessie Page makes an admirable
character study of her difficult part of the
religion-withered wife of the missionary;
and Renee Glynne is a satisfactorily massive
and complacent Ameena, the native wife
of Joe Horn.
A new bottle of the laughter tonic was
opened at the Grand Opera House on
Saturday in “The Gorilla.” Frank Neil’s
assurance to the audience that the play is
rnpt intended to be taken seriously was as
superfluous in the circumstances as that
offered by Bottom and his liard-handed asso-
ciates. The affair is a brisk sequence of non-
sense compounded of thrills which force gasps
from the audience, a punctuating fire of pistol
shots, and a mystery which is carried on
the running chain of events until the last few
minutes, when an adequate explanation is
provided for all the people who appear and
disappear and the solid walls and floors
which open mysteriously and as mysteriously
close. The main comedy rests on the
shoulders of Frank Neil, a very scared nigger
servant, and Victor Fitzherbort and Bert
Le Blanc, as broad comedy detectives Mulli-
gan and Garrity. Paul Plunkett, beginning
stiffly as Arthur Marsden, gets into liis
stride later, and has a likeable “opposite” in
.Mae Moore, as Alice Denby—the only woman
in the cast. Although Frederick Ward is
sometimes more an annoyance than a news-
paper reporter, he and the others (including
Eric Harrison as The Stranger, Vivian
Edwards as a stagey Cyrus Stevens and
Robert Purdy as Dr. Wilner) assist materi-'
ally in keeping the ball of nonsense rolling.
“Tweekie,” at the Empire, has been con-
densed to reasonable limits, and gains in
attractiveness thereby. The bill at the Syd-
ney Palace will cease to be “Outward Bound”
on Friday week; “The Broken Wing” will
flutter into that theatre on Saturday, Novem-
ber 5. The success of Maurice Mosco-
vitch in “The Ringer,” now in its ,I.2th week,
has postponed the advent of “The Terror,”
another mystery play, at the Royal. “Castles
in the Air” continues to be built to the
accompaniment of music at Her Majesty’s.
The last weeks of “Lady, Be Good” are fore-
shadowed ; “Archie,” which was produced in.
Melbourne a couple of years ago, is Avaiting
to get into the St. James.
Jim Gerald has been able to ruh “Th e
Honeymoon Girl” for three weeks at Ful-
lers’ Theatre (Sydney) ; “A Whirlwind of
Youth” is to take its place on Saturday.
Gerald’s praiseworthy effort to lift the
standard of the vaudeville revue thoroughly
deserves the success which has attended it.
* * ❖ *
At the Sydney Tivoli Olsen and Johnson
have cut some of the fluff out of their show
The burlesque on “The Ringer,” finishing
with all the performers claiming to be the
mystery gentleman, is well worth seeing;
there is also some admirable dancing by
Elizabeth Morgan, and commendable singing
by Herbert Browne and the Big Four. Also
the hefty Achilles and his comic friend are
back, and in the Ackermans a tuneful turn is
presented.
By way of a change there is a chance of
being saturated with British patriotism at
the Prince Edward, Sydney, where “The
Flag Lieutenant” was welcomed by a gala
audience last Friday. There is enough. “Gor’-
save” in it to satisfy a Millions Club ban-
queter, the same being partly due to the
association of a film of the Empire travels
of the Prince of Wales with the main pic-
ture. That, it might be remarked, is a
Canadian film. The main picture suggests
that the entire British Navy, with generous
stores and ammunition and some land forti-
fications thrown in, was lent to the producers
for the purposes of their story. The settings
are impressively real, and the shelling of a
native town, with the flight of its black in-
habitants, is quite the best thing of its
kind that has been presented. Australian
Dorothy Seacombe is in the cast. The Crys-
tal Palace also displayed a new film on
Saturday in “The Seventh Heaven,” which
looks like being a long-distance runner.
Over-sentimentalism spoils the attractive-
ness of “The Whirlwind of Youth,” brac-
keted at the Sydney Lyceum with “Private
Izzy Murphy.” It would be a fresh, delight-
ful story if kisses were not dragged out to
whole chapters. Hoyt’s gives an example of
an American attempt to be French in “On
ze Boulevarde,” where the sparkling raci-
ness of French humor falls into dull vul-
garity. “White Pants Willie,” which is this
picture’s companion, earns more approval.
As. one of the attractions of a store which
relies largely on the patronage of mothers,
Grace Brothers are screening a picture for
children, “Captain Barney’s Boy.” It runs
for 20 minutes, and if Mum can’t manage
her shopping so expeditiously Albert or
Cissie won’t mind seeing it again. The pic-
ture is an Australian production, made by
John Bedouin —the last stage survivor of a
family well known in Australian stage his-
tory.

The amateur grand-opera ship of George
English labored in a heavy sea of difficulties
when the Yic. Postal Institute choristers
essayed “Cax-men” at the Princess last week.
No band parts were available, and the tre-
mendous task of re-orchestrating the entire
opus from the score had to be undertaken.
Even that job wasn’t finished when the
curtain rose on the first night, and the
oboes and the horns and other instrumen-
talists were constrained to improvise from
the pianoforte record as they mooched along.
So if Margaret Bogan’s Carmen, though
sweet-voiced, showed more proficiency in
lighting cigarettes than in keeping time, the
said difficulties may be partly blamed.
Edward Beechcroft’s Don Jose was a Spanish
he-man of considerable address, but the
Escamillo of Jack Wright was a slipshod
fellow. In the mass production of choruses
the company shone, and if Bizet was listen-
ing-in he may have been mollified by that.
“THE WHOLE TOWN’S TALKING,”
AT MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Chester Binney ( R. Barrdtt-Leonard),
about to woo Ethel, his boss’s daughter
(Thelma Burness).
The Seven Labors of Hercules were
nothing to the 700-odd troubles of Gregan
McMahon, who has just produced three new
plays in the one week in Melbourne. Only
those who have, seen a play—especially a
repertory play—in the rough can kriow what
a first night really means. On Friday after-
noon “The Old Adam” resembled a half-
erected house with the bricklayers complain-
ing bitterly that they could not lay bricks
without mortar and the mortar-mixers pro-
testing that mortar can’t be made without
sand. It was still in much this state when
the ushers and programme-sellers surged into
the King’s for the last night of "Liliom.”
Yet “The Old Adam” went smoothly enough
on Saturday, absorbing the interest of a fair
audience in the story of the mythical democ-
racy, which, because it has a ray that can
put machinery out of action, accepts the
gage of battle flung down by its neighbor,
only to discover that the neighbor has a ray
of its own. The last act, in which com-
batants. revert to pikes and halberds and
fishermen of the rival powers fight with boat-
hooks, is somewhat given to garrulity, but on
the whole Cicely Hamilton’s comedy is an
intelligent evening's entertainment. Full
marks for good behavior may be awarded
to Charles Dougherty as a rude caricature
“CASTLES IN THE AIR,” AT
SYDNEY HER MAJESTY’S.

of Lloyd George, Oscar Belirend as Ins min-
ister for foreign affrays, Hubert Curling as
liis war lord, and W. H. Chandler as his
cynical chief of staff, who sees through the
monkey-shines of politicians; but the junior
leads deserve a smart smack with a couple
of adjectives for stiffness. To-morrow night
will be the last opportunity for repertory
patrons to rush headlong into the King’s in
pursuit of the intellectual drama. On Satur-
day the Vanbrugh-Boucicatilts will be at
home to their friends in “Caroline.” Invi-
tations may be obtained from Allan’s at the
usual prices.
* * * *
At Melbourne Royal “The Whole Town's
Talking” continues to exhibit Marie Burke
bereft of music. Mrs. Pompadour will reign
over France at His Majesty’s for eight niglits
more —after which “The Student Prince”
will proceed to love his maid and ride away
every night and at the usual matinees. Bep-
pie de Vries will be the maid. The Athenaeum
still has no difficulty in renewing daily that
portion of the cast of “The Last Warning”
which is supplied by the audience. Of
drama in the flat, “The Term” is doing well
at the Auditorium, and Hoyt’s is announcing
that traffic “On Ze Boulevarde” is confined
to adults by order of the Censor.
* * * *
Count Ercoie Filippini’s Italo-Australian
Grand Opera Co. debouched on the stage at
Melbourne Princess on Saturday and made
a frontal attack on the melodramatic story
and familiar airs of Verdi’s “Rigoletto.”
In one particular at least the people who
stayed outside missed something. The some-
thing was Carmencita Mascagni as the
foully-manhandled Gilda. This country
usually gets its prima donnas when they are
middle-aged and fat, but Miss Mascagni
turned out to be a pleasing creature still
gambolling in her ’teens, who forced her sym-
pathetic voice a trifle in the upper storeys,
but was otherwise vocally fresh and sweet and
acted with more naturalness than Verdi’s play
deserved. The rest of the company collected
by the Count, who was left behind by the
Gonsalez company, were quite adequate. The
chorus of Don Juanesque courtiers was a
trifle conscious of its naughtiness, as if it
was wondering whether its wife or girl
weren’t in the audience; but it sang melodi-
ously, as a whole, and in time to a well-
trained orchestra, whose deliberations were
presided over by the tall, shingled form of
the Contessa Filippini. As the misshapen
.Tester with the hump on his back and the
hunch in his soul, the Count himself was
much in evidence, and most of the evidence
was in his favor. ILis malignancy stopped
on the threshold of melodrama, and his
passion for his daughter penetrated to the
inner courts of feeling. Enrico Rigattieri
played the Duke who makes a week-end habit
of seduction, in a pleasant tenor way ; and
Alessandre Barbares provided the assassin
Sparafucile with a tall figure and strong
bass daggers in the voice. Bert Woolley sang
Count Monterone’s fearful curse. The bill
changed into “Trovatore’s” clothes on Mon-
day, and “Traviata” was Tuesday’s fare.
To-night the Duke will be sung by Vincent
McMurray. The Bulletin wishes the Filip-
pini enterprise success, though any organisa-
tion that calls itself “Italo-Australian” raises
some mild suspicions. Most of Pavlova's
Russians who weren’t Englishmen were
Maorilanders, and of the present company.
Miss Mascagni is oil that was struck in
Queensland.
* * * *
Stiffy and Mo will occur at Melbourne
Bijou on Saturday, and there is an air of
expectancy about the Bourke-street building
that amounts to a religious hush.
Half Poverty Point seems to have invaded
Mornington (Vic.) for the melodramatic!
purposes of “The Rushing Tide,” Kaola
Film’s blushing debutante upon Melbourne
Majestic’s private screen. Eardley Turner’s
reliable facial expressions are the picture’s
greatest asset. Norman Dee is a monument
of languor on the ordinary stage, and as the
hero of “The Rushing Tide” he sits about
so much that when he is constrained to
walk 100 yards his acting has to take
another prolonged rest to get back its wind.
The picture is a moving tale of diamonds
hidden on the beach, which the villain steals,
only to learn from a Collius-street jeweller
that they are paste. A golden opportunity to
give the yarn a telling finish was lost when
the villain merely threatens to smash a
gramophone on Norman Lee’s devoted head.
In this commentator’s opinion, the instru-
ment should have burst to reveal the real
gems concealed within. As it stands the
hero has to wait for the reward of his virtue
until his investments mature. Otherwise the
film is a meritorious attempt to please the
pitchertariat.
❖ * * *
With enough gold in their expansive
mouths to salt a mine and sufficient silver
in their voices to charm the musical ear, the
Colored Emperors of Harmony continue to
interest at Melbourne Tivoli: the fat Caruso
of the troupe has a wondrously amorous
bellow, and his three dark thin companions
are gifted with pleasantly-contrasted trebles;
hence their joint melody is much superior to
ordinary coon caterwaulings. George Car-
ney’s serio-sentimental re-creations of the
immemorial Cockney are also far above the
banalities of the average English comic
character, as represented by Fred Curran.
Bernt’s partner—she of the immature figure
—continues to walk up one side of Berut
and down the other, a feat more laborious
than useful, like drinking beer with a fork.
The show above mentioned will be at the
old address, Olympia, Melbourne, for a few
days longer.
There was hardly standing room at Mel-
bourne Playhouse on Saturday when the
Steinach film “Rejuvenation” was screened
for men alone. Whether it is a fact or
fairy-tale that old men, as the result of a
simple operation, can be made to take a
renewed interest in the way their wives do
their hair must be left to the scientists them-
selves to decide. They have scotched each
other’s pet theories before, and doubtless they
will do so again. What sticks out from this
pictured treatise is the immense possibilities
of the screen for educating the lazy-minded
who never open a textbook. Judging by the
behavior of some of the audience, the nearest
they had hitherto got to the facts of sex was
a baf-room story. One even collapsed on
the floor and had to be resuscitated by his
neighbors.
Melbourne art shows :
By leaving most of the major problems of art to
more plodding painters, English water-colorist A. H.
Knighton Hammond (Fine Arts) is free to let his
exuberant fancy run wild amidst decorative scenes,
gondolas afloat and old buildings snoozing in the
sun. Sometimes his water doesn’t lie and frequently
his distances don’t recede, but his color caresses and
his sunlight is a soothing thing and his romantic
viewpoint is a long beer of forgetfulness in this too
realistic world.
(Continued on Page 54-)
AT WIRTHS.
The old man loitered beside the door ;
His face was wrinkled, his beard was hoar,
But he wouldn't go in—not him—no more,
He wouldn’t go into Wirths’.
“Not for a million,” I heard him say,
“I Wouldn’t go in if you was to pay!”
And the old man spat where no spittoon lay.
He wouldn’t go into Wirths’.
“I wouldn’t go in because, you see,
It ain’t the show that it useter be”
He murmured a date that seemed b.c. —
“Them was the days for Wirths’ !
“When the mastodon jumped through the
flamin’ ’oop
And the brontosaurus looped the loop
And the megatherium with a whoop
Chased the clown round at Wirths’.
“And a mammoth as big as a good-sized ship
Knelt down when the circus-queen cracked
her whip—
She never would stand any blooming lip,
Would the circus queen at Wirths’!
“When the lion-tamer- —he knew his job—
Stuck his head in the sabre-tooth tiger’s
gob—
And the best seats cost a bloke a bob.
Ah, them was the days of Wirths’.
“When the archaeopteryx flew around
And the tetrabelodons shook the ground”—
He spat where no spittoon could be found—
“ Yes, them was the days of Wirths’.
“Dorgs ’n’ monkeys ’«’ norscs! —Why,
They rode eohippuses ten yards high!”
The old man wiped his rheumy eye
And hobbled away from Wirths’.

General Motors cars are proved on its private Proving Grounds
of 1245 acres—the first of its kind in the automotive industry.
A high speed race track is only one of the many features which
include every condition of grade and road surface. Over 100
separate tests are conducted under scientific observation with in.
struments especially developed for the purpose. Only when a
model has been proved perfect is it released for production and
distribution all over the world.
VOLUME means economy. This basic
economic law is the first reason why
it pays to buy a General Motors car.
General Motors builds a car for every purse
and purpose. In its line of cars are included
Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Oakland,
Buick, La Salle, Cadillac and Vauxhall cars.
It also makes Chevrolet, and GMC Trucks
It pays to buy a General Motors car because
General Motors Research Laboratories as-
sure that General Motors cars are in the
front rank of newest developments.
It pays to buy a General Motors car because
its purchases of raw materials are scientifi-
cally specified for greatest quality and value.
It pays to buy a General Motors car because
its factory methods are precise, and its
equipment the most modern to assure
economical production, and to assure
thorough quality in workmanship.
It pays to buy a General Motors car because
of the careful way in which General Motors
builds, inspects and tests its cars on the
General Motors Proving Grounds.
It pays to buy a General Motors car because
General Motors service is everywhere.
5,000,000 people have bought General
Motors cars. 1,215,826 people bought
General Motors cars last year.
Each year General Motors grows—as each
year more people learn that General
Motors cars are good cars to own,

nns FUNDERS LANE. MELBOURNE
For those who like stories with their pictures
there is L. Bernard Hall (Athenaeum). Christian
martyrs at the Coliseum, girls peeping roguishly out
from under monkish hoods, and suchlike themes
abound. Even the red-headed “Lady with the
Sponge” evidently has a story. It is “The Sponge”
—not any old sponge. One conjectures that half a
dozen divers lost their lives ere it was recovered
from the ocean floor; or that Dempsey’s seconds
used it in the recent fight with Tunney. Following
up Bernard Hall’s stories is apt to make one forget
the quality of his painting, which isn’t always good.
The flute-playing lady called “Andante” is resting
on ground which looks like a carpet, and the tree
she has her head on is a bit of stage scenery only.
Such things are likely to happen to a painter over-
concerned with stories. As teacher and director of
the National Gallery, Hall exercises a great influence.
Which possibly explains why Melbourne artists
still largely draw their inspiration from the era of
Victoria the Good and Albert the Goody-goody.
Amateur and professional photographers are flocking
to the Assembly Hall, where the Kodak people have
collected examples of the camera art of Europe,
Britain and America. Nowadays rapid plates and
improved lenses enable the photographer to operate
even in a darkened theatre, and new papers and
methods of printing allow him to manipulate his
sitter’s features with the freedom of a fashionable
portrait painter. So the modern camera man is
beginning to sign his pictures, wear his hair long
and discourse about his temperament. All brands
of temperament are displayed in the current show.
There are Cumbrae Stewarts of the camera who
rejoice very gracefully in the nude, there are stormy
souls who revel in wild waves and windy skies,
stern realists of the Meldrum school and polite
portraitists of the Longstaff stable. One man makes
all his subjects look like Gainsborough people; and
one photo is an astonishingly smart imitation of the
famous Mona Lisa picture.
May Vale has a modest show at the Queen’s Hall.
Her still-lifes are respectable efforts, and she exhibits
some enamels which glow inwardly like opals; but
her art generally lacks atmosphere and attitude.
No. 1, “A Friend of the Poor,” shows a very tall
monk with a basket which would not go far in a
large starving family. “Learning Her Lesson” is
an old-fashioned picture of an old-fashioned girl
which should be carefully sprinkled with dust and
offered to the Felton Bequest as an Old Master.
The selectors of the Vic. Artists’ Society have as
usual allowed the tail to wag the Spring Exhibi-
tion. Amongst the few outstanding landscapes are
Eric Buckmaster’s “Morning Silver,” a misty view
of Sydney Harbor, executed with his customary
insolent assurance; and Murray Griffin’s “The Valley
and the Cloud,” a romantic recreation of a mood
connected with the Yarra near Heidelberg. Mabel
Pye has painted “Mabel Kay,” but has omitted to put
a body inside the lady’s blouse. W. B. Mclnnes,
who is not up to his Archibald Prize form, has
painted a smile on “Amethyst,” which looks as if
it will degenerate in time into a simper, like most
painted smiles. There is no grace about “His Grace
Archbishop Mannix,” as seen by F. G. Reynolds, but
the same artist’s “Dr. Maloney” is a vigorously-
depicted politician. In endeavoring to portray a
woman and a tableful of electroplated ware, Norah
Gurdon, in “Silver Day,” has only achieved a con-
fusion of unrelated planes. “The Finishing Touch”
of W. G. Collins is expert but uninteresting, while
F. R. Thompson’s “Rural Dwelling” is a rough but
strikingly lighted structure. In a “Portrait in
Squares” Ami Zimmerdahl blows the Cubist trumpet
before the walls of Jericho without endangering the
foundations. In “The Forge,” showing centaurs being
shod, I.' Flett follows Norman Lindsay at a very
respectful distance; and W. H. Oliver’s “From the
Old Wharf” would make a suitable poster for a
shipping company. In “Autumn Roses,” Hedley
Parsons has discovered that such blooms are often
pink, but that is the full extent of his exploration.
Alma Figuerola’s are the only still-lifes that seem
honestly realised. Sculptor Montford weighs in with
a ton or two of martial female for the Camperdown
war memorial. The texture of the lady’s robes is
excellent and her pose is rhythmic and impressive.

At Adelaide Royal “Cradle Snatchers”
is drawing crowded houses; if any heads
are being shaken in reprobation it is
more over what might have happened in the
garden than over anything said or done on
the stage. Crooks and bulls are off the bill
at the Prince of Wales, where Muriel Starr
and company are playing “French Leave,”
one of their best productions to date. Har-
vey Adams’s Brigadier-General is too vener-
able to be anywhere outside a club; but
Carl Lawson and Frank Leighton provide a
satisfactory captain and lieutenant, while
Muriel Starr is a charmingly-vivacious young
wife. When Desmond McMinn adds broken
English to his natural lisp, he might as well
talk Chinese. Bertha Ballenger scores a
hit as the kitclienmaid in “Between the
Soup and the Savory.” Robert Roberts and
his Bon Bon Revue Company are doing well
at the Majestic. Some scenery is on view
at West’s in “Hotel Imperial” showing the
Russian drive through the Carpathians in
the early stages of the war.
Poverty
Point
“Peter Pan”: Margaret Lawrence, who
impersonates Sadie Thompson in “Rain,” is
the fourth actress to be identified with the
part in Australia. Barbara Hoffe played it
for Hugh Ward at Melbourne Palace in
1.923, but Barbara being very English and
Sadie very American results were unhappy.
In subsequent years Muriel Starr was anxious'
to have a go at the part, and while under
her own management recently had plans com-
pleted to try it when she came to Sydney.
Then the Firm handed it to Judith Ander-
son, who was keen on playing Sadie. She
got as close as one week from the opening
night, when illness sent the plans awry.
“Spokeshave": George Lane, who has been
Poularding with "Mme. Pomp..” will lead
“Rose Marie” into the hinterland. It will
be the largest rural expedition ever sent
out by J.C.W., even the multitudinous Totem
Pole Ballet going with it. Lane will mer-
chant the gags of Hardboiled Herman, a
part he took. at Drury-lane, and Bertha
Ricardo will yodel for a lover amongst the
canons of the Canadian Rockies.
“Cine Ma”: A gazette exhibited in Mel-
bourne depicts a drive after ’roos and emus
on a big Victorian station. An army of
beaters goes out followed by a motor regi-
ment of guns. The beasts are driven in in
hundreds, and after the guns have taken
their toll the residue, some badly wounded,
are corraled, crated and despatched to zoos
in various parts of the globe. The motor-
ists return, potting stragglers to right and
left. The picture is so curious and vivid
that it is certain to have a wide circula-
tion in other lands. But there is no need
to advertise to a censorious world the spec-
tacle of scores of unfortunate animals hop-
ping about with broken limbs or to stress
the fact that some of the gunmen were
rotten shots.
“Craiser”: “Just look at this!” snorted
Kendall Irving Bloggs: “ ‘Marjorie Playfair,
of the Vanbrugh-Boucicault company, who
is just 17, graduated from the Royal
Academy of Dramatic Art. Loudon, and this
is the first time she has left home.’ In my
day, me boy, an actor-r who was an actor-r
matriculated from the kindergarten of Hard
Knocks into the University of Life. I am
now waiting to hear of Bosker Sasche, the
eminent tragedian, of the Smithson Corres-
pondence School of Melodramatic Bunk.”
“Craiser”: Despite “The Last Warning”
and “The Ghost Train,” stage illusions don’t
really show much advance. Nothing recent
has been more effective than the machinery
of “On Trial,” the court play Madge Fabian
brought to Sydney and the Criterion 10 years
ago. Double sets of rails curved across the
stage, each line crossing the other about
the middle. On one set a platform accom-
modated the court and on the other was the
scene of the crime. A witness would say “I
swear I saw a blood-stained hand come round
the door.” There would be a black-out, and
the court would trundle off, and the door
and the blood-stained hand would amble on.
This went on at intervals throughout the
night. It was a soft job for the court; it
just had to keep its seat.
“First Old Man”: Worthy of note that
three of the first four record-breaking plays
which made fortunes in London (B.
13/10/’27) were the work of actor-authors.
Oscar Asche was responsible for “Chu-Chin-
Cliow” ; the late Brandon Thomas, one of the
finest “character” exponents the English
stage has seen, concocted “Charley’s Aunt” ;
and H. J. Byron was the author of “Our
Boys” and 50 other successful pieces. “Tin
Private Secretary,” another stayer, was
adapted from the German by Charles Haw-
trey. And, to conclude, the worldbeater,
“Abie’s Irish Rose,” was from the pen of
American actress Ann Nicholls.
“St. John’s Wood” (Lond.) : George Gee
has sprung into fame as one of the best low
comedians in London. In “The Girl Friend"
he is associated with Emma Haig, an Ameri-
can soubrette who has also caught the public
fancy. The play was hammered into shape
in the provinces before it was produced in
London. Seven authors had a hand in it,
but it owes most to Herbert Clayton and
Jack Waller, who have had a wonderful run
of luck these last few years and deserve every
bit of it.
“Cauboy”: Australians in U.S.A. who
have found shops lately are Plumpton Wil-
son and Dick Bellairs —they have type parts
in “Escape.” Bobbie Chisholm, the bari-
tone, is in a Hammerstein show, the
lanky Adelaidean Athol Tier is on the Keith
circuit, the best in American vaudeville. Big
Bob Grieg is olaying comedy lead in “The
Countess Maritza,” a Sliubert play. Alt'
Frith, after a disastrous spin, finds himself
in drama, the deadliest drama ever penned
—Bram Stoker’s “Dracula.” He gets all the
laughs, however, as he has the only gleam
of merriment in the piece. John Fuller and
Ernest Rolls were recently seen in N’York
viewing their latest purchase, “Rio Rita,” a
Ziegfeld show. It may be only a coinci-
dence that Gladys Moncrieff was seen there
too, but some are drawing the inference
that Gladys will be back in Australia soon.
“Hamfat” : The Taits have discovered that
time has not hamstrung Jack Fanning's
activity as an “advance” man. The Carrolls
engaged Jack to take “The Ghost Train” io
Adelaide, but it was the Taits who got him
to do Broken Hill, Ballarat and Bendigo.
Fanning’s first venture in the entertainment
business was in 1877 —he is now 71; —when
he took a Blondin imitator to Bendigo. It
was at Fanning’s instigation that ’Arry
Rickards took the Opera House in York-
street, Sydney—and laid the foundation of
his fortune.
“M.G.S.”: “R.K.D.N. (B. 6/10/’27),
might have mentioned that Seymour Hicks
tried to be serious in Australia, too.
“Scrooge,” the curtain-raiser to “Sleeping
Partners,” was the occasion. Hicks did the
Dickens character in his usual devil of a
hurry, but all the accessories of the gan-
grened ghost of Jacob Harley, “super-
natural” atmosphere provided by the bang-
ing of a drum and the sentimental visions
of Bob Cratcliit’s starving household failed
to make the occasion solemn. Hicks was
just the same old clown in a tragic mask.
“Rhodes” : The picture-show in the West-
ralian cocky township was packed. I was
esquiring a lady who was very small, very
English and very loyal. All went well until
w 7 e reached the Gazette, in most of which
members of the Royal family were shown,
opening Parliament, at the races, fox-hunt-
ing or doing other odd jobs. .The pianiste
was painstaking as well as patriotic. Every
time any member of the family was flashed
on the screen she rattled off “God Save,”
and every time she rattled it off the little
lady beside me leaped to her feet, and I,
perforce, had to unfold my 6ft. 5Mn. as
an accompaniment. When I got up for
about the ninth time the hall was in an
uproar, and tire air was thick with missies
ranging from conversation lollies to
oranges. Never was a man more pleased
than I when a Wild-West film displaced the
Gazette.
“C.R.”: The Firm has finally made up
its mind to kick-off the grand-opera season
in March with “Turandot,” the play which
was not quite completed when Puccini was
called away to improvise upon a harp. Merli
will have the tenor role and Signorina Lom-
bardi the soprano. As usual, La Scala is
going to have a thin time next year; judging
by the announcements, all its leading singers
will be warbling in Australia. It is a
wonder the Milanese don’t compel Mussolini
to enforce a star quota system on J.C.W.
“Cauboy”: The Firm profess to be so
pleased with Leon Gordon, whom it describes
as “the actor-playwriglit,” that it is bring-
ing him back in 1928. It would be interest-
ing to know whether Gordon will appear in
more plays of his own composition. His
claim to the authorship of “White Cargo”
was hotly contested by the lady who wrote
the book from which the play was taken.
“Flaming Youth”: Ken Duffield and Dion
Titlieradge have sold the British rights of
“Hullo, Healo,” first produced in Australia,
to W. H. Berry, one of London’s most popu-
lar comedians. Duffield, who belongs to a
South Aus. clan that fattened on flour, has
built the music for four light offerings to which
Titheradge, actor and author, has put verse
and dialogue. The partnership has been
profitable to both young men, and the sale
of “Hullo, Healo!” should encourage them
to continue.
THE ONE-REEL COMEDY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Miss Constance Talmadge, the screen star, has
been granted her [second] divorce. Recently she
declared that marriage and the movies did not mix.”
If you would be a star, my dear,
Be wary of that desert drear,
That arid, unromantic waste
Of wedlock. Though a maiden chaste
May find therein a certain bliss,
In some sequestered oasis
Removed from the rude world’s alarms,
Within a legal lover’s arms,
’Twill tax you, trust me, quite enow
To be a temporary frau !
The longer dramas lack appeal—
Make yours a snappy, cute one-reel!
THE EASIEST WAY TO BECOME A FIXED STAR.
THE JUVENILE LEAD: “I have been under the one management for twelve years.”
THE NEW SECOND LADY: “ Goodness! I didn’t know you were married.”
The arcs of Hollywood will-flare
But dimly on the wedded pair
Wlio’re too respectable and staid;
So if it be with you, sweet maid,
That matrimonial leaning’s strong.
Then lean —but do not lean too long.
A serial picture, you may run
To any length ; but once begun
Upon your mating masterpiece,
See that you get a quick “release”
Of each instalment —that’s the plan—-
And frequent change of leading man !
VICTORIA.

Another demonstration of
B.S.A. Reliability
in the
International 6 Days’ Trial
Yet another success is added to the already long list of B.S.A. achievements.
In the 1927 International Six Days’ Trial B.S.A. reliability was again
proved, riders of B.S.A. machines winning
Manufacturers’ T earn Prize (No marks lost)
Class C. B.S.A. 4.93 h.p. O.H.V. models
Six Gold Medals
The rider of a B.S.A. 3.49 h.p. and sidecar gained GOLD MEDAL
and made the best sidecar performance in the 350 c.c. Class
The rider of a B.S.A. 7.70 h.p. and sidecar gained GOLD MEDAL
and made the best sidecar performance in the 1000 c.c. Class
The strenuous nature of a Six Days’ event proves the reliability of a machine
beyond all question. In the 1927 Six Days’ Stock Machine Trial 4 B.S.A.’s
were entered, gaining 4 Gold Medals and the Manufacturers’ T earn award.
In the 1927 Scottish Six Days’—B.S.A.’s gained 3 Gold Medals. Now the
International Six Days’ ! Conclusive proof that B.S.A.’s lead the way in
power, efficiency and reliability. B.S.A. reliability is what you want in
your motor-cycle.

“ What a lovely
Australian Argosies.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
CARRIED by a current, gallicd by a gale,
In his driven dug-out, from some dis-
tant pale,
Out beyond the Ages, somewhere in the Past,
So the Neolithic savage on our shores was
cast,
Ere the ships of Pharaoh, cautious, crept
the seas,
Ere the sails of Sidon bellied to the breeze.
In their prowling prahus fared the fierce
Malays,
Searching for the sea-slug in our northern
bays;
Junks from crowded China, dhows from
Mozambique,
Harried by the typhoon, in some mangrove
creek
Lay awhile and rested; then by sun and
star
Steered a course uncertain for a port afar;
Mourning o’er misfortune, wailing weak
lament,
For the huts of palmwood, or the desert
tent;
Dreaming of their women, hearing low again
Laugh of children playing, pleading in their
pain
To the sullen sea gods that a visioned shore
Rise above the waters theirs for evermore.
Questing gain or glory, plunging the un-
known,
Caravels from Lisbon glimpsed a silent, lone
Land, unmapped, uncharted and a traveller’s
tale —
Lest their foes forestall them, filled with
terrors pale—
Homeward bore of marvels and of monsters
seen:
Beasts and men and demons, hostile and
obscene.
Holland’s sons heroic, nothing daunted, drew
O’er the southern seascape, and in nearer
view
Learned the western coastline, marked the
secret chart.
Kept their stolid counsel, played their stolid
part.
Hartog left his record; dimly through the
years,
They glide again by Leeuwin, valiant myn-
heers.
Out from lazy Lima, out from Callao,
Down the blue Pacific Spanish rovers go,
Hearing by green islands, coral reef and
bar
Singing soft enchantments, where brown
maidens are;
Faring towards Port Curtis, wearing shoal
and reef,
Adding to the story still another leaf.
Qpmeth Cook’s Endeavour, sea-stained, rising
slow,
O’er the eastward waters. In the morning
glow,
Peers a British sailor; shading eyes with
hand,
Calls his welcome warning: “To the west-
ward —Land!”
Calls his mighty message; ’twas a trumpet
blast
Waking thee from slumber, Land Divine, at
last.
There the Terra Austral! There the future
home
Of an English people, sea-borne o’er the
foam!
There in peaceful effort might their genius
pen
On a page unblemished deeds of super-men!
There the Terra Austral, pre-destined of
grace,
As the Greater Island of an island race!
Come they now r a-many in their oaken hulls,
Dipping like the dolphins, rising like the
gulls,
Running down by Rio, round the Cape and
Horn,
By cool trade-winds carried, by salt sea-
winds borne,
Sad-faced, grey-clad firstlings; free-born
pioneers;
Soldiers, workers, traders, of Colonial
years.
Axes bite our timbers; spades and plough-
shares moil;
Yields the hillside —vintage, gives them
grain—the soil.
Huts rise in the clearings, roads run thro’
the wild ;
In a rough-hewn cradle Britain rocks her
child,
He who sprung to Manhood when the war-
drums beat,
Trod the dust of Flanders with unflagging
feet!
In their holds her Argos bore the infant
needs
Of the younger offspring. Soon the faithful
seeds
Of a distant Homeland fruitful harvests
yield
From the sunlit pasture, from the fertile
field;
Wine and fruit and fleeces, silver, lead and
gold
Made returning cargoes, crammed the out-
ward hold.
And the outward Argos, in the days to be,
Shall be deeper laden, tells my soul to me,
With a wealth of fabric woven in our mills.
With a greater riches from our plains and
hills,
With the finished products of Australian
hands
Borne in hulls of iron unto other lauds.
In my eyes a vision, in my ears a song,
Of Australia mighty, self-contained, and
strong. _ .......
She will mould m metals; she will shape m
i teel;
On liar quays of Commerce she will place
her heel. ... . . , .
To the Furthest Oceans will her Argqs trade
With the needs of mankind, all—Australian-
made.
Yea, hei .hips of iron, builded by her Sea,
Shall go forth, deep-laden, in the days to be,
Filled with fashioned fabric, cloths, and silks
a-sheen, _
Lathes and locomotiveSj moulding and
machine,
And the screws of Progress, as they churn
the seas,
Shall proclaim the Anthem of our Industries.

The Thing in the Radio-room.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
IN a mood of after-dinner discursiveness
we three men had been idly discussing
wireless. It was pleasant, after that
admirable dinner, for Steen, Hargraves and
myself, in our host’s comfortable room, to
idle while Steen tuned in to the broadcasting
company. .
Steen was what is termed a radio fan.
He had his beautiful superheterodyne receiver
installed on a pedestal; but of the etheric
waves that brought music to the room and of
the forces that operated it he knew less than
any schoolboy of this amazing era. Ihe
songs and lectures and music that came
through every night merely filled in an after-
dinner pause in his busy day.
Hargraves was a new acquaintance to me.
Steen had wanted me to meet him for a
business purpose, and he had chosen this din-
ner —no women —to enable us to get together.
Hargraves seemed to me a quiet, dependable
man —just the sort of business man I had
hoped to meet. .
"After all,” I remarked, “this wireless is
only a toy, a toy for adults —and one that
seems to me to need considerable improve-
ment.... Statics and those other noises
blurring the music No ; wireless has gone
as far as it can.”
“Ah, yes,” put in Hargraves ; but thjre s
a serious side of wireless. Tbe music and
the rest of it is delivered at the home just as
the other necessities or luxuries are delivered
at the door. Canned music! But there s
more in wireless than that. Ever tried
transmitting?”
“Never tried it,” laughed our host. 100
technical and all that.”
Hargraves sat forward in his comfortable
armchair. “Ah !” he said. “Think of the -ro-
mance of sending out messages through the
ether —if there is an ether any longer^—seek-
ing for someone whom you don’t know,
somewhere millions of miles away, perhaps in
some other planet. Reaching out, feeling out,
sending forth urgers into the unknown! And
then to get a reply from nowhere, a tap-tap
of Morse that signals unseen and distant
replying to your communication !”
“I didn’t know,” said Steen, “that you
were a wireless expert. This broadcasting is
only a trivial game. But the romance of it
interests me.” ,
Hargraves laughed. Im no expert; but
the uncanniness of it makes me
I’ve seen an amateur transmitting, that s all.
“I wonder,” I said, “if there isn’t any
danger in wireless?”
“Danger?” questioned Steen. How could
there, be?”
“Perhaps,” said Hargraves, “we’re break-
ing into something that might somehow smash
things. We’re trifling with a new force, and
we don’t know exactly what reactions we
might set up. We haven’t gone very far into
the affair; we’re just exploring the fringe of
tnose wireless waves. Now we’re getting
down to short waves; and really we know
precious little how they’ll behave. Never
heard of any accident yet—except once. 111
tell you about it. ....
“Remember,” said Hargraves, sipping his
sauterne, “the excitement when the ‘X’ rays
were discovered, and how carelessly the scien-
tists dabbled with them, with the result that
valuable lives were sacrificed. They were fool-
ing with something that they didn’t under-
stand, and the poor fellows paid the penalty
of their devotion to science. We know more
about those rays now; but mightn’t there be
something analogous in these very short
waves that the wireless men are getting
among so rashly? What do we know about
these things?” . . ..
As Hargraves’s voice died away there was
a stir in the room. For myself I had the
feeling that something brushed my cheek. All
imagination, of course. .
Steen broke the silence. “Fupny thing,
he said. “I’ve been reading in one of the
radio publications of an insect, a beetle or
bug, found in Australia. One of those scien-
tific fellows has discovered—or thinks he has
discovered —a. beetle that sends wireless
waves by means of his antennae!”
“Antennae!” said Hargraves. That s
curious—very curious ! Antennae ! I never
thought of that.”
Eagerly his audience, Steen apd I, waited
for the reason of his interest; but Hargraves
was too busy with his thoughts to break
silence*
At iast he roused himself. “It has been
suspected that the antennae of an insect
might form a tiny aerial that would be able
to transmit communications to another insect.
For all we know the insects might have used
infinitesimally short waves to talk to each
other.”
“Absurd!” I could not help remarking.
Hargraves did not notice my interjection.
“That fellow in Australia says he has put
two bugs apart, each unseen by the other,
and he claims that when one bug emits a
flash another bug flashes back exactly half
a second after the first flash. He suggests
that this is what the antenna; of an insect
are for: to communicate with another insect
by signals. And what else could the
signals be but wireless waves? According
to this theory, every insect, such gs a
moth or beetle, uses its aerials both to send
and receive messages. Nature doesn t waste
time in providing useless appendages. And,
hang it all! what else does an insect’s
antenna; suggest but a radio installation?”
“You mean to say,” said Steen provo-
catively, “that the insect world is far ahead
of us in this new power—that it has been
using a wireless of its own for millions and
millions of years, while we’ve just discovered
the thing?” ~ , „ ~ „
“That’s just what I do think,” said Har-
graves. “ixiok at the ants! Th.ey*ve worked
out long, long ago a civilisation that is, as
far as we can see, the perfect socialistic com-
munity. I’ve watched ants; and I don’t be-
lieve that an ant could loaf if it tried to;
and each ant fits into its niche in this
socialism of theirs —there are no unemployed

and no capitalists. Just as well that we
haven’t reached that stage yet!”
Steen, becoming restless, moved to the
wireless receiver and gave us jazz ; but Har-
graves almost irritably asked his host to
turn the switch off.
“Let me tell you a story,” he began. “It
was a suggestion of yours made to-night
that, I think, gives me the clue to that story.
It was the suggestion that the antennae of an
insect might convey radio messages. But I
warn you you needn’t believe it if you don’t
like. To me it seems clear.”
He turned to me. “It was your sugges-
tion that there might be unforeseen dangers
in radio. ‘There are more things in Heaven
and earth than are dreamt of in our
philosophy.’ ”
“One moment!” said our host. “If your
story is a long one, drinks are in order.”
Hargraves hardly touched his wine. He
was obviously obsessed by the story he was
to tell.
“Well, here’s the story,” Hargraves began;
“but, frankly, I don’t expect either of you
to believe it. But I do! I can’t produce my
witnesses—one is dead and the other has
disappeared; but I’ve got written evidence
to prove it, though I doubt whether in a
court of law my evidence would be admitted.
“I shall not give the man’s name. Doubt-
less you have never heard it, nor will. Let
me call him Smith. He was a keen radio
student, a man of, say, thirty. Occasionally
he used to invite me into his wireless room,
though he preferred to be alone. Sometim-.s
he would lock himself in the room all night,
forgetting the need for sleep. I gathered
that he was on an unexpected trail among
the extremely short wireless waves. He had
got down to a wave-length as short as a
metre, which, I understand, means an aerial
of about half a metre. Still, these details
don’t matter in the story. The main thing
is that he was getting into a new order of
wave-lengths of which we know T very little.”
“Excuse me,” I broke in; “but you’re
getting beyond my depth.”
“And mine,” said Steen.
“I apologise,” said Hargraves; “but this
man Smith had gone deeper still. However,
the rest of the story is in writing—the writ-
ing of Smith.”
Hargraves produced the evidence from his
pocket-book. As far as I could see it con-
sisted of a number of sheets of paper with
pencil scribblings on them. He smoothed
them out.
“His story begins,” said Hargraves, “with
various notes of wave-lengths and calcula-
tion, written, as you see, quite legibly. This
sheaf of writings was found when we broke
into his locked wireless-room after three days
of silence. Nobody wondered what had be-
come of him. It never occurred to us that
he was in his room. We assumed, if we
thought of him, that he was away. We were
accustomed to his disappearances; he was
not communicative. I found afterwards that
he had only a few relatives, in another city,
and no close friends. He was a solitary
man. No interest apparently in women.”
Hargraves settled down in his comfortable
arm chair.
“I should imagine that it was near the
end of his extraordinary experience that he
committed it to paper. He was then evidently
in a state of extreme exhaustion; but the
curious thing—though perhaps not so curious
—was that he never attempted to escape
from the room and from It. All he had to do
was to unlock the door. He was apparently
so absorbed in the affair that he had deter-
mined to see the end of it. And, as you will
see, it was the end of him—and I believe a
happy end. But he left his manuscript—
this!
“ ‘When I look back on these two or three
days, I am not sure that’ ” —Hargraves read
from the sheaf of scribbled notes- —-“ ‘I am not
sure that my mind has gone. I was experi-
menting with the short wave-lengths when
the amazing thing happened. There was
a blinding flash. It seemed to fill the whole
room. The first thing I did was to see if
anything serious had happened to my wire-
less transmitter. No, that was in order.
I was bending over my set when I heard a
curious sound behind me—a sort of rustling.
At the same time I noticed a peculiar scent,
faintly acrid. Then I felt a weird sensa-
tion, as if some bird had brushed me with
its wing. Startled, I turned quickly around,
and saw It!
“ ‘At the first glance it looked like an enor-
mous, brilliant bird-like thing. I thought
I had gone mad. It filled the room. Its
body was as large as mine, while its wings
were three times as large. But it wasn’t a
bird, I immediately saw. It had extra-
ordinary plumes of a marvellous blue—l had
never seen such a blue. And then I saw
what it was, an enormous butterfly! It
peered out at me, with immense black eyes,
from a face that was in parts horny and
furred, with gracefully curving antenna} that
fluttered incessantly.
“ ‘lt was looking at me intensely with
its enormous eyes. I had to look away;
those eyes seemed to have a hypnotic force.
I don’t know much about insects, but it
seemed uncanny to be stared at by this
butterfly thing. I felt sure that behind those
extraordinary features there was an intelli-
gence. Its black eyes stared into mine. I
shuddered. I felt fear for the first time in
this encounter. Befofie that I was too
startled to be afraid. Yet it was no animal
that looked at me; it was without doubt a
member of the insect world, but of an almost
inconceivable size. Imagine a human being
meeting a spider three times his own size!
I dared not turn away from its steely stare;
I was confronted by a mask of steel—some-
thing like a knight in a steel helmet must
have looked.
“ ‘But though I felt afraid, I was not terri-
fied. I imagined that this butterfly regarded
me with deep interest but not with anger
or hatred. Already, as you see, I endowed
this visitant with an intelligence akin to that
of a human being.
“ ‘lt moved forward and I did not shrink.
Its antennae moved to me and touched my
face; it felt like an incredibly soft finger
caressing my features. Then it lifted a
wing and gently brushed me. The sensa-
tion was not unpleasant; it stirred me to a
strange lassitude. And then, suddenly, I
felt myself enveloped in a warmth of soft
delicate feathers, with that uncanny set
of uncouth features against my face.
“‘l struggled from that horrible embrace ;
but those wings had wiry muscles; and it
was the butterfly that released me. Though
I hated the Thing, I felt helplessly drawn
to ir. ’ .
“ ‘lt was like being fondled by a gigantic
soft, furry tarantula.
“ ‘I don’t know when the Thing moved away
to the corner of the room ; but though the
strange scent seemed to be emanating more
and more strongly, I was able to. regain my
senses. And then, quite suddenly, the but-
terfly seemed to settle down into a curious
quietude. Perhaps it was asleep. It lay
quiet for some hours, I think; and this that
I have written was put down on these sheets
of paper. It is to me extremely important
that this strange adventure should be re-
corded in all its details; and whatever is to
be the end, I feel that I must give this story
to the world.
“ ‘ln this pause, with the Thing still asleep,
I must quickly set down my theory of the
visitant. The only explanation I can put
forward is that this enormous Thing has
been materialised by some unexplored force,
possibly that of the wireless waves. In the
regions of the short waves, of which we
know so little, there may be forces tapped
by our experiments that may have snared,
or caught, this ethereal being, something that
inhabits the regions of these electric impulses,
one of a race, of inhabitants of impalpable
things that exist, and maybe have existed
since the beginning of time. One of the
dwellers of the borderland between matter
and electric impulses, perhaps a species of
being created before the universe was
built up But other research men will
follow my trail and find out; It is enor-
mously important. There may be whole
worlds listening-in to our amateur efforts,
beings of which we can have no conception,
trying to get into touch with these new sub-
scribers —for, after all, we are but making
our first clumsy efforts to explore the regions
we are tentatively entering. The latest
scientific opinion is that the ionized atmo-
sphere of the earth in the highest layer pre-
vents our wireless messages getting out
into space; but may there not be wire-
less impulses that are pouring into the
earth’s atmosphere and penetrating to us —
if we could only pick them up and interpret
them? We have not yet discovered the
rightly-tuned receiver.
“ ‘The Thing is waking up! I hate its car-
esses ; and its enormous eyes are like great
drops of ink. But there is nothing human
in them. It is as distant from our human
world as the inhabitants of a world beyond
rlie Pleiades. There is no possible contact
between me and It
“ ‘lt is still drowsy, and I have been look-
ing into its face—if it can be called a face.
Seen close, its antennae are remarkable;
spreading out in a graceful curve until the
tips must be about three feet apart. Its
mandibles can hardly be seen, and instead
of a mouth it has a long tube, evidently
developed for sucking up its f00d.... But
what f00d?.... A horrible thought has as-
sailed me...-. What if the nectar on which
this Thing lives is blood —human blood?
To feel that long muscular tube fastening
like a suction-pump upon a living human
being ! Sucking... .sucking... .till the feast
is finished,..and every drop of blood has been
drained from it.
“ ‘But I must not think of that. What I
have to do is to kill it at once. But could
I?. The aroma of the Thing seems to have
dulled my sense. It sickens me.
“ ‘I don’t know how long I lost conscious-
ness. The Thing had fastened its horrible
sucking tube upon my neck; but I fought it
off. Then I felt it withdraw its suction....
perhaps it means to keep me? Perhaps the
food is distasteful to It? But lam very
weak n0w....
“ ‘A very curious thing has happened. I
Avill try ■to set it down before.... I heard
the familiar sound of a wireless call—
notes of Morse. I noticed that the Thing's
antennai were quivering rapidly. Immedi-
ately I repeated the signal—and found it
repeated again. Where had it come from,
and from whom? It was no recognised call.
I tapped off a series of dots and dashes.
These were accurately repeated. I tried
again, and was again repeated. Somebody
or something was repeating my message!
“ ‘I knew then what was calling. Every
time the repeating signal was made the
butterfly fluttered its gigantic blue wings and
its body writhed as with an effort. It was
putting forth wireless impulses! Then I
heard a call that was quite meaningless, but
quite definite. Rapidly I repeated the call;
and the butterfly quivered all over.
“ ‘I knew then that I had made a disoover.v
unique in the history of this earth. I had
established communication with a being of
the insect world ! True, it was not an ordi-
nary insect, being compact of electric im-
pulses ; but once a message had been sent
and received, even though it was meaning-
less —just an unintelligible cry in the dark-
ness of Space—the way was open to develop
a sign language, just as perhaps we may
soon hope to establish a sign language with
Mars. .. .
“ ‘I must have fainted again. That sucking
tube was over my heart. I cannot shake it
off; and curiously enough, I feel no desire
to struggle. lam infinitely happy. Those
enormous black liquid eyes are looking into
mine, but soon I shall have t0....1....
The scent is overpowering me....1’....

“That,”, said Hargraves quietly—“that is
all. I leave it to you to say whether there
is-any danger in our human efforts to investi-
gate the mysteries of matter. That poor
fellow has at least made one step into the
darkness.”
“And then?” I asked.
“The man I have called Smith was found
lying dead in his wireless-room —we had to
break into it—in an atmosphere of a sicken-
ing aroma with strange punctures on his
body, as if the blood had been drawn to
the surface by some enormous pneumatic
force. There was no sign of his Visitant
except a plume of some great bird clutched
in his dead hand. The body seemed hard
and dry.”
“Mad! The whole thing!” Steen said.
“There are more things !” said Har-
graves.
