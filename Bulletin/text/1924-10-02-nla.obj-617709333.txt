Henare’s Reformed Religion
As some earnest Bulletin inquirers have
recently remarked, the early Maori knew
baptism. But it was no sacramental func-
tion. Tangata Maori was nothing if not
practical; the main purposes of mankind as
he saw it being to fight and eat and be com-
fortable, the boy-cliild was baptised to make
him strong for cultivating food, catching fish
and killing his enemy; the girl for handling
mats, firewood and strangers who came to visit
her husband. Further, whereas our medie-
val church baptised to remove the sin due to
Adam’s lapse, the Maori planned thereby
to purify the mother after her accouchement.
When the pakeha first began to write
about him the Maori had in one form and
another a good deal of what is largely called
religion. There is evidence that of old he
and his far-flung kind observed rites as
murderous as those of the best-accredited
faiths knowm to high civilisation. Even to
human sacrifice. Grey estimated that “at
least four millions of human beings have
been offered (throughout the islands of the
Pacific in which the customs of the Maori
and his kind prevailed]' in sacrifice to false
gods,” in addition to “a frightful list” of
children murdered under a system of infanti-
cide and of adults in suppression of sorcery
and witchcraft. The Maoris had a cosmo-
gony of their own, beginning with “darkness,
darkness, light, seeking, searching, chaos,
chaos,” and curiously recalling Milton’s
“eldest Night and Chaos, ancestors of Nature
....pregnant causes mixed confusedly,”
waiting for the Almighty Maker to “ordain
Plis dark materials.” Indeed, here and
throughout, inspiration from Asiatic and
European sources is so patent that it be-
comes impossible to know how much of
Henare’s “religion” grew on the parent Poly-
nesian tree and how much was grafted from
imported stock. Grey once told me that the
British soldiers found the Maori a wonder-
ful adapter; if they successfully used any
new manoeuvre on him, in the next fight he
would try it on them. Apparently he was
as clever to make-over faiths as tactics.
There was a Maori Adam who longed for
female society, as his descendants have done
even unto this day. Instructed by his mother
(Earth) lie made a human form out of dust
on the Biblical plan; but as he could only
make a man and wanted a woman, he had
to go among his relatives, the goddesses, to
get the extra parts. Shortland —good, re-
spectable man —discreetly puts into the Latin
Mother Earth’s instruction for this — “Quae-
dam partes corporis penUales.” A version
of the flood used to be current among the
Maoris, a terrible story of how the fiercest
son of the gods (or ancestors) strove trium-
phantly against hurricanes and storms until,
as Grey finely translates it, “Tu-matauenga,
or man, still stood erect and unshaken upon
the breast of his motlici - , Earth; and now at
length the hearts of Heaven and of the god
of storms became tranquil and their passions
were assuaged.” The purgatorial theory was
pei'haps too harsh for the optimistic Maori.
His version of more worlds than one ex-
presses itself in a three-Heaven scheme, one
for the gods, one for men to reside in until
they mature, and a third whence water is
spilled over by the wind to make rain for
the earth. Here man sojourns until he is
born. Old P'atito, on his way to another
and better world, was followed by an im-
portunate grand-daughter. The old man
turned and looked at her angrily, whereupon
she was tunicd to stone. Evidently this was
Henai'e’s best l’ecollection of the story of
Mr. and Mrs. Lot. There was a sun-com-
pelling Joshua in old Maoriland, Maui, who
stopped Old Sol by noosing him with a flax
lariat. Maui himself, most versatile and won-
derful of all the Maori gods, is a compound
of many Biblical heroes. Maui-potiki, or
Maui the Child, they called him. He was
born unknown to his mother, and as a baby
spoke with tongues. He was hated by his
brothers, like Joseph, and like him also was
conspired against by them. (The Maori got
nearer the original in this respect with little
Hatupatu, whose brothers did kill him,
though he was subsequently raised from the
dead.) It was Moses Joshua Joseph Maui
who halted the sun —and, incidentally, who
fished Maoriland up out of the ocean; Maui,
too, who, in one legend, as an infant was
thrown into the water by his mother. There
were resurrections, for did not Te Atarahi
arise from the dead and become seen of
scared men and women? So earnestly was
the original followed that even a god came
back, though only to get a wife. And, as
from the Gadarene swine, evil spirits were
exorcised from humans by holy men.
It seems, therefore, that, while the original
Maori had some scheme of cosmogony and
theogony, it became hopelessly tangled with
the stories his descendants learned from the
missionaries in his new country. As the
island peoples among whom Columbus and
hjs companions landed- accepted the new-
comers as gods, so would the Maoris take
what the white pakeha told him for gospel
in a double sense and remould his beliefs on
the new model. The kindly philosopher who
reflected comfortably that so many Pacific
Islanders had lived and loved and fought
and died without ever knowing that there
was such a place as Hell would rejoice to
learn that, although the Maoris’ progenitors
had a hereafter', there was no fireplace in it.
The spirit of the bodily dead flew to the
Ileinga, ci’ossed a river (a Styx, or more
probably a Jordan), and was welcomed and
fed by a population contented but desirous
of more people. Te Atarahi, who had been
there, gave Hell very favorable report as a
place where the food was good and plentiful
and there were no complaints. From which
we learn that Henare could look forward to
a good home after his old age, until the
pakeha burst upon him with that hope-killer
about unending drought and fire for all who
didn’t abandon the good old Maori ways and
follow those of the white man who wore un-
comfortable clothes, drank waipiro (“stink-
ing water”) and had only one Heaven —or
Hell —to the Maori three.
H. J. T.
Bait Men Bite
Male humanity finds an undeniable attrac-
tion in the highly-colored and flagrantly-
camouflaged female. The thick layer ox
obvious powder, the frank flame of false red
and other boldly-administered chemical
requisites to beauty strike a responsive note
in the male breast. Whether the adminis-
trator of these veneerings realises it or not
(and usually she docs not), they carry a
plain message to the subconscious mind of
the male. These are the marks of the woman
who is for sale. They proclaim that the
bearer has femininity and sex, is aware of it,
is aware that men desire these things, and is
willing to place them at the disposal of the
most favorable bidder. It is not insignificant
that a certain profession of women has been
called “the most ancient,” for this means that
the practice of the arts of that profession has
become instinctive in womankind, and has its
counterpart in the instinctive response of
man. Our male ancestors for countless ages
have freely, or secretly, resorted to women of
that sort; regularly, and with the keen
anticipation of deep-seated desire. This
must have been so, otherwise the “most
ancient profession” would hardly have held
its place so firmly while other professions
have come and gone. Instinct is the in-
herited experience of the race, and all of us
have inherited a dim memory of that oft-
repeated experience. So the most moral and
austere cannot avoid an almost intoxicating
attraction to the woman who. powders freely
and paints obviously.
Most women who do this are unaware of
whose or what example they are following;
are blissfully unconscious of their perhaps re-
mote kinship with the professional wantons
of old. They think they do these tilings
because it is fashionable, and adds to their
appearance, and helps them to attract men.
So they do. But it is fashionable, and it
adds to their attraction, because of the afore-
said reasons, and they have pinned their
faith on a deeper appeal than they realised.
Women are given credit for a great store
of curiosity, and perhaps they have it; but
men have it too. If women are curious about
many things, men are curious about one
thing. Men are curious about women, and
having ouce fixed their curiosity upon an in--
scrutable subject, that subject has absorbed
almost all of it. This desire to understand,
to fathom, to investigate woman is also in-
stinctive in men; and, unfortunately for
most of us, -women have come to know it.
That is, some of them have. We pass a
woman who is veiled. As we look for her
face, we see spots of it, and spots of shadow'
cast from the veil. We seek her eyes, but
a broad, drooping hat has obscured them. We
have met a direct challenge to our curiosity,
and very few of us have the caution, once
given an opportunity, not to pursue this
mystery until we know T . The woman desires
pursuers; and this challenge to the instinc-
tive curiosity of the male inevitably insures
them. If she wants a husband, she gets him
too, but loses her obscurity thereby.
Women desire pursuers. Until quite re-
cently almost all women were on the marriage
market, to be knocked down to the highest
bidder. This meant, of course, that the
amount of comfort and social prestige a
woman was to enjoy depended upon her
ability to attract the man with the most of
these things to give. Competition was
naturally very keen. It still is. And the
woman with the most pursuers usually gets
the highest bidders. But occasionally we
meet a woman who affects an indifference to
it all, and to all men. She does not try to
please. Her attitude often offers a warning
and a threat to those who make advances.
Such a woman usually rationalises her atti-
tude by thinking that she is “not trying to
catch a man.” Asa matter of fact, she is going
further back and appealing to a more primi-
tive emotion in man than are her sister-
virgins ; for it seems clear that in every race,
and every clime, the first form of marriage
was marriage by capture. Women were a
part of the spoils of wax', and were captured
by the men who had slain their brothers.
These primitive women fought hard against
capture and escaped if possible. In any
case, they appeared to want to escape. They
let men think they had actually captured
them, and men wanted to think that, for it
flattered their masculine pride. Those were
the days of savagery; the days of savagery
were many, and the impulses of savagery are
still strong. The woman who “doesn’t want
to catch a man,” and who makes pursuit
perilous, is appealing to the most primeval
trait of all, and is certain to have many pur-
suers. Also, being a woman, she is certain to
be caught—just when she decides to let herself
be.
I have been writing of women who angle
artfully with carefully-baited hook. But
there are women who do not angle, who use
no bait, or at least !do not depend upon it,
and who are always certain of a catch.
They use a net and that net is Sex. They
require no expensive clothes, though they
wear them if they can get them. They re-
quire no rouge, though they use it if it is
fashionable. Theirs is not the carefully veiled
or forbidding aspect. They have an intrinsic
quality which dispels all need for art or
artifice. They have a healthy, full-blooded,
unconcealed, pulsing and riotous sexuality.
It flames from their eyes, speaks in the ful-
ness of their lips and the contour of their
profile; has form in the clamoring femininity
of the entire figure; is, in fact, exhaled from
them in every suggestion that their presence
conveys. These are the sort of women Nor-
man Lindsay loves to draw, but Norman
Lindsay is not the only one who is attracted
by them. All masculinity is attracted by
them, and the appeal of clearly-defined sexu-
ality is stronger than any other appeal
woman has ever found the art to hit upon.
Not all of us are so outspoken in admitting
it. We rationalise over it and give it another
name. But the woman whose presence pro-
claims sex is never without admirers and
pursuers and lovers. Intelligent or unintel-
ligent, coarse or refined, expensively dressed
or otherwise, crude or cultured, she is always

LESTER WAY.
An Austrian Apocalypse
Some months ago a handsomely-bound
book temptingly labelled “privately-pnnted
fell into my voracious hands. Its title-page
proclaimed it “unexpunged and complete
(1923).” A fly-leaf was inscribed: Ut
this edition, intended for private circulation
only, nine hundred and ninty-nine copies have
been printed, after which the type has been
distributed. This is copy No. 315. ±he
book was Merry-Go-Round, by Georges
Lewys, and in it the red and the blue the
only shades for the modern popular novel —
find an entente cordiale.
1 pass over my initial explorations with
“Merry-Go-Round” by quoting a sentence or
two from a Prefatory Note that explains the
secret of why there are only 999 numbered
volumes: —
It is not necessary to blush for the truth) nor to
apologise for realism ; the book must be accepted for
what it is worth: not the triumph or failure of virtue
or vice but the frank weighing of values in the
scale of social depravity and regeneration. Caution
is merely made against any attempt to approach
incidents in the story from a too-sensitive (American)
viewpoint.
Strange that in a time of flagrant freedom
in the domain of the Printed Word the de-
vices resorted to in marketing “Merry-Go-
Round” should really not be tricks, but com-
pulsions ! The thing is made clear in one
word. America. The book comes from there,
translated from the Austrian by an un-
known. America’s coercion of thought is
without parallel in the whole wide world
outside Russia. A land that suppressed
“Jurgen” might easily and avidly imprison
Lewys, or at least his unnamed printers and
publishers.
“Merry-Go-Round” is a story of life and
manners in Vienna just before, through and
after the war. Its flavor is voluptuously
Continental. It is shockingly scandalous and
sensuous, with salacity and sublimity in close
companionship in foul sewers all through its
hectic delights and lechery. The stories of
seduction are done with a boldness almost
terrifying, but with a subtle quality that
makes them masterpieces. If I venture the
opinion that with all his genius D. II. Law-
rence here meets a foeman greatly worthy of
his, steel, I do at any rate suggest the power
of Georges Lewys. And who he is I don’t
know. But I should think his book quite
likely in the future to be turned to as a
grosser “Tom Jones” of the Continent of the
early twentieth century.
It annoys me that a work of this calibre
will be kept off the shelves of my countrymen
with the plea that their cleanliness, though
next to godliness, may be blown like a
feather before the wind. For not since “The
Story of an African Farm” have we had a
novel so stirringly uprooting down among
the dregs of complacency and convention. To
be sure, this comparison must end there, as
the two books have naught in common other-
wise. The one is 40 years later in the evolu-
tion of candor, and only in this respect is as
the other once appeared. “Merry-Go-Round”
is a story cast in the shadows of a special
sort of AVorld, Flesh and Devil. Stark, sor-
did, subterranean —physically and emotion-
ally—Lewys’s transcript is still transcript.
It is in this way the strength of the strong.
The author cannot be charged with not tell-
ing everything. He tells it all. . He is the
painter, not the preacher—the scientist, not
the stirrer-up. The reader is left to himself
with whatever lessons he likes to learn.
Despite its revelations of rottenness, its
nakedness of lust, its very barefaced, even
shameless, depiction of emotions and scenes,
“Merry-Go-Round” finally lifts you high over
it all to fling you humiliated at its feet. Just
as wherever you have a revolution you have
also a counter-revolution, so in this story
you have a love affair mightier than the
oceanic obscenity which enmeshes it. It is
a love affair reminiscent of Tolstoy’s “Resur-
rection” and productive of a climax even
grander. Georges Lewys brilliantly adorns
Realism Avith a craft the cunning of Avhich
is peerless, and unlike Zola he is never re-
dundant or dull. His philosophical reflections
are almost imperceptible, but are made with
a brevity that flashes like lightning.
“Merry-Go-Round” begins with a Count
and Countess who, breaking their betrothal,
go their several ways—the one to a slimy
suicide after being any man’s cast-off, the
other to matrimonial happiness after a very
saturnalia of “wild oats” debauchery. De-
generacy was bred in the bones of both;
thereafter they had excess of lascivious
leisure. In looseness each was as ugly as
the other, in tastes the scale went equally
downward, and there is no reason why one
should have been damned and the other
spared—but it is so. It is simply that the
Countess takes up with a repulsive groom,
the Count with a circus girl, and the one is
destroyer and the other saviour. Others high
and low impinge upon the fates of the four.
All through the war they go—and here the
sidelights are dazzling in the splendor of
their picturing. Italy is thrown on the screen
in a w*ay that puts arms about you. Of
Sarajevo and what went before and after
in Court, Commerce and Circus an H. G.
Wells could not be more graphic portrayer.
Of that Emperor. Franz Joseph, described
by George Sainsbury as “unluckiest from
first to last of all monarchs in history.” this
book is tragically a pitiless photograph. Of
Vienna it is the epic:—
Vienna. .. .old... .gray... .historical. .. .
The town of joy... .of gladness... .and of mirth. ...
of sordid sorrow. .. .and of grief
of song.... .of wine... .of heart affairs. ...
of sentimental tears... .and heedless prankish
laughter....
of mediaeval pomp... .and martial spirit....
... .the town of dukes. .. .of princes... .and of counts
.... and beggars....
of women sweet and pure and harlots
Vienna with a code of morals all its own....
bravely idling away the hours
to the strains of Strauss and Lehar
not knowing of to-morrow....
Vienna, vibrantly decadent! The wanton
she was, undressed by “Merry-Go-Round,”
will never fade from the eyeless sight of
Vengeance.

author is Ernest Grillo, M.A., who has halt a
dozen books on Italian subjects to his credit,
the present volume, published by Dent and
Sons, bearing the imprimatur of the Depart-
ment of Italian Studies of Glasgow Univer-
sity. He has adopted the sensible plan which
has proved so successful in the Loeb Classics,
the English rendering in prose being placed'
opposite the original. .
It requires but a small acquaintance with
the Italian language to enable one to appre-
ciate the exquisite beauty of the lyrics with
which the pastoral is strewn, and the reader
who does not fall under the spell of the
melody of the chorus in Act I, Scene 2, can
have no music in his soul. It goes chiming
and tinkling along, raising and lowering its
tone like a brook on its course, amidst
obstructive boulders, from the opening lines,
“O lovely Golden Age” (O l)clla eta dell
oro ), to its conclusion, where it exhorts the
nymphs and shepherds to give all to Love.
According to this chorus it was Honor that
was responsible for the disappearance of the
ideal conditions of life of the Golden Age.
It was Honor that made love a theft (it had
been a gift) ; it was Honor that made the
nymphs tie up their hair which used to float
free in the winds, and caused them to cover
their nudity with a veil. Nymphs and shep-
herds no longer bathed and played. amor-
ously together in the fountains. This bait
was held out by the sophisticated Daphne to
the shy Aminta —she tells him that Silvia
is about to bathe in Diana’s fountain in the
good old fashion belonging to the Golden Age,
and she bids Aminta come and catch her at
her ablutions. Aminta hesitates, and when
he does arrive it is to find Silvia, naked, in
the hands of a satyr, and tied to a tree by
means of osier bands and her own hair. He
promptly routs the satyr, and unloosens the
bands from Silvia’s arms. In endeavoring
to free her feet he meets with a sharp rebuff,
the proud nymph with the iceberg heart con-
temptuously telling him to unhand her, as she
is Diana and can untie herself. Then she runs
away without offering any thanks for her
rescue. We feel, however, that her conduct
will alter in the end. And it does. Finally,
the chorus bids Honor depart from the woods
where its grandeur cannot be understood,
and exhorts it to let the lowly people live
after the manner of the ancient race of men.
The chief business of life is to love. “Let
us love; the life of man has no truce with
the years: and it passes away. Let us love;
the sun sinks and rises again, from us its
short light is soon hidden, and sleep leads
on eternal night.”
Though universally acknowledged to be the
most perfect example of pastoral drama ever
penned, “Aminta” was not the first one to
be produced. There were several forerunners
which Tasso was privileged to see performed
at the ducal palace in the island of Belvedere.
But though he borrowed a few trifles, his
borrowing was like Shakspeare’s—he touched
nothing that he did not adorn. All the pas-
toral plays that preceded “Aminta” were per-
formed at the Court of Ferrara in the pre-
sence and under the patronage of the beauti-
ful sisters of Duke Alfonso, for one of whom
(or both) Tasso was said to nourish a tender
passion. In praise of these ladies —the Prin-
cesses Eleonora and Lucrezia D’Este—Tasso
wrote many charming canzone. According to
the poet Carducci and other authorities, there
were four pastoral dramas properly so called
which were the precursors of “Aminta.”
These were Beccari’s “II Sacrificio,” Argen-
ti’s “Lo Sfortunato,” Cinthio’s “L’Aretusa”
and Lollio’s “Egle.” There were, of course,
numerous eclogues before this time, Dante,
Petrarch and Boccaccio being fond of this
form of expression. Boccaccio, in his prose
romance “Ameto,” celebrated his Fiametta,
the lovely daughter of King Robert of Naples,
as a nymph dressed in green, and in his
“Teseide” and “Filostrato,” written in ottava
rim a (he either invented this or first used
it), are celebrated the loves of Palamon and
Arcite, and Troilus and Cressida. Both of
these were dedicated to Fiametta. His idyll
“Ninfale Fiesolano.” in the same metre, was
written later (1345). After 1573, the date
of the production of “Aminta,” the rage for
pastorals spread everywhere, and it did not
die out until the eighteenth century was well
on its way. Fletcher's “Faithful Shep-
herdess” is about the best-known in Eng-
lish, though there are hundreds of others.
Mr. Grillo thinks that the only serious rival
to “Aminta” is Guarini’s “Pastor Fido,”
which, I notice, still appears in the cata-
logues of Fratelli Treves, of Milan.
Mr. Grillo gives a very interesting account
of the evolution of the pastoral drama from
the idyll and the eclogue, and explains that
a . Facola Boschercccia, such as “Aminta,” is
a combination of eclogue, tragedy and comedy,
and must end happily. The metre is a mix-
ture of septenaries and hendecasyllabics
interlinked by the rhyme, the bright little
septenaries by their agility helping the grave
and stately long lines to roll on, so that a
harmony between tragedy and comedy is
gracefully sustained. “Aminta” has a pro-
logue. five acts and ten scenes. The obduracy
of Silvia, the nymph of Diana’s train who
was insensible to love and preferred the
excitement of the chase, is finally conquered,
though it required the sight of Aminta’s
apparently lifeless body (in despair at her
supposed death he throws himself over a
precipice) to transform her from an iceberg
to a Vesuvius of passion. She tears her
hair and beats her chest like a Bacchante,
throwing herself upon his prostrate body and
kissing him frantically—
in guisa di Baccante
Gridando e percotendosi il bel petto
Lascio cadersi in su ’1 giacente eorpo
E giunse viso a viso, e bocca a boeca.
In his “Gerusalemme Liberata” Tasso re-
turns to the theme that ends the chorus in
Act I —the swift passing of the life of man
and bids us gather the rose of love while
we may and whilst love can be returned.
Oogliam D’Amor la rosa; amiamo or quando
Esser si puote riamato amanolo.
L. G. D.
Daley, Lawson and Quinn
Blaxland. with its sooty turpentine-trees,
the deep blue mountains, the harsh-voiced
jays, the baker's cart crying out on account
of the pain in its springs; the old Pilgrim
Inn. which I tried to draw on a fly-leaf of
Hazlitt’s “The Spirit of the x\ge”; sweet-
scented fox-gloves, goats distributing their
rougher flavor, the pine-branch fires, the
lemons, the deserted garden and the burned
foundations in the bush; the lost pony whose
unpared hooves have grown to the proportion
of the longest ski-ing shoes; the men who
came from Penrith selling apples and cab-
bages. Nights spent round a chimney with
books, and a lamp swung from the ceiling;
the sudden knock at the door, the staring out
into the dark, with nobody to meet the eye.
Not even the sound of footsteps. The return to
the lire, and our talkabout Victor Daley* Harry
Lawson and gentle-hearted Roderic Quinn.
I described my last visit, with A. G.
Stephens, to Victor, at Waitara, only a week
before his death. Victor was sitting up, fully
dressed, on a verandah at the back of his
little house. There was something not-of-
this world in his expression: a bright, ner-
vous revelation of spirit which he was trying
to hide, as if it might be a vanity—the pride
of dying. It seemed that he was more con-
scious of the soul growing powerful within
him than he was of the tired body stooping
towards the earth. “A.G.” said: “I like you
with your hair as it is” (the brown locks had
grown long). “It makes you resemble Tenny-
son.” Daley’s reply was a sarcastic remark
at his own expense. Looking towards me, he
remarked whimsically; “So this is the boy
upon whom my mantle is falling?” I think
Stephens (who is really my father-in-letters)
ha.d said something previously to him about
his hopes for myself; but I was deeply
touched when Daley alluded to it. I could
say nothing; yet I longed for him to give
me his favorite pen. He remained ignorant
of this desire, because I could not be so
callous as to ask him.
Daley spoke calmly of death, and repeated
a conversation brought to him, in which X
was supposed to have said: “They say Daley
is unafraid to die. But how can we be sure
it isn’t bravado?” The poet sat straight up
in his chair after that; then he exclaimed:
“When you see X again, remind him of those
words, and ask him if ever he saw any mad-
ness in my eyes?” Upon our departure he
walked with Mrs. Daley to the front of the
house, and my last memory of him is a frail
figure standing near the road, his stick lifted
over his head to wave “Good-bye,” and the
sun running down the sky to meet him in the
west. I didn’l know Daley so well as many
other people did ; but I understood him better
than some.
A. G. Stephens tells the pretty story of
his reply to the visiting nuns who said. “Do
not thank us, but thank the grace of God.”
“And are not you the grace of God?” came
the gallant answer.
I love Phil Harris’s story of how Harry
Lawson once brought him a poem which
somehow would not work out quite right. It
was about a horse, and Phil asked him to
take it away and think over it; Lawson
agreed, and he hadn’t been absent above five
minutes when Phil, looking out of his office
window, was astonished to see the poet lean-
ing over the traces of a carrier’s cart, very
earnestly regarding the leader. Harry talked
to the horse, and apparently listened for
replies; sometimes pausing as if he would
impress certain ideas upon his memory. This
continued until the appearance of the driver,
whereupon Lawson thoughtfully withdrew
down tlie lane, and, returning to the office,
soon had the poem finished.
Poor Harry had his weaknesses ; but upon
one occasion lie looked after me, and saw that
I came to no harm.
Henry Lawson and Victor Daley are both
dead. Roderic Quinn is still with us —one of
the simplest and dearest of beings, and a
great poet. Roderic doesn’t run about try-
ing to impress people. He is more with the
skies and the angels of God than with men.
We thought of all these things at Blaxland,
with its sooty turpentine-trees, the deep blue
mountains and the harsh-voiced jays.
HUGH McCRE.
A Satchel of Books
The Cruise of the Amaryllis, by G. H. P. Muhl-
hauser (John Lane). A yachtsman who did fine
service in mine-sweepers and Q-ships in the late war,
Mulilhauser set out in Sept., 1920, with a 36-ton yawl
from Plymouth to Bail round the world. He
arrived back in July, 1923, 10 years older than when
he started. He died shortly after. This is his
diary, fascinating to laymen as well as to yachts-
men —the record of an indomitable spirit. His little
craft was a familiar object in Neutral Bay during
the two months he spent in Sydney.
The Sea Wolf’s Hoard, by Vernon Williams (Ward
Lock). The author dumps an English fishing village
on the Australian coast and saturates the place with
the sort of romance that is associated with the
’thirties and ’forties, when running French brandy
across the English Channel was a matter of high
adventure. For the purposes of the story it was a
matter of indifference whether Australia or Patagonia
was selected as its theatre. Australia had the hard
luck of the choice. Besides being old-time fiction
moving awkwardly in a new dress, it is a tale to
make the prohibitionist weep ; for it suggests that no
coastguard patrol can keep smuggled liquor out of
this country.
Love’s Wild Geese, by Jack Kahane (Grant
Richards). This is a novel with a boudoir perfume
and the rustle of silk petticoats. The price per
dozen of the eggs laid by the wild geese may be
appraised from the epigrams, incubated by the heat
of midnight oil, scattered through the pages. “Mar-
riage,” HCd&ne admitted, “is still a French girl’s
chosen career.” “I wonder why,” murmured Isabel,
and added idly: “but of course, unless they were mar-
ried they couldn’t deceive their husbands.” HM&ne
was a lady who frankly admitted that a baby and
a middle-aged university professor “weren’t really
enough.” Events run the usual course of philander-
ing, divorce and repentance—the last being an obvious
sop to the Cerberus of convention.
Mr. Arnold, by Francis Lynde (Methuen). It i 5
pleasant to turn from the introspective, psychological
studies of the day to the solid ground of history. It
suggests a change from the laboratory, with its chemi-
cal-tainted air, to the wind-swept country. This
arresting tale turns on a familiar incident: the defec-
tion of Benedict Arnold, brilliant officer of the Ameri-
can Revolutionary army, to the British army. In
1780 Arnold was put in command of the important
garrison of West Point. There he came in touch
with the unfortunate Major Andre, subsequently shot
as a spy, and conspired with him to hand this strong
military position to the commander of the British
army. The plot was discovered, Andre seized, and
Arnold escaping found refuge in the British lines. The
Revolutionary army was at that time almost bank-
rupt in exchequer and in hope. Arnold’s treachery,
whilst arousing the profoundest indignation among
his late fellow-officers, was followed by a steady drain
from the revolutionary ranks into the British camp.
To arrest this flow and to bring Arnold to punishment
was the mission, in this novel, of one Capt. Page,
under instruction from Colonel Hamilton. Ho-.v
Page, a member of one of “the old Dominion” fami-
lies, risked his honor and his life in the perilous
task, without success, is the theme of the book:
and so skilfully is the story told, with just the
right suggestion of the period, that the reader lives
for a time in its environment. An excellent novel,
clean, healthy and virile.

THE ONLY CAR 1
IN THE WORLD
WITH
PATENT TRIPLEX SPRINGS
TRIPLEX Springs, for which the Overland Company hold
world-wide patent, are unquestionably the most import-
ant improvement in light-car riding comfort since the
introduction of the pneumatic tyre.
They not only make riding easy, but they guard the mechanism from road shock,
prolong the car’s life, and greatly reduce wear and tear.
You will note one remarkable feature of the Overland Chassis. You have all the
economical, easy-handling advantages of the 100-inch wheel base, but the riding
base or spring base is 1 30 inches, which is from 30 to 60 inches longer than any
car selling in the Overland price class. The result is exceptional riding comfort for
passengers on the worst and roughest roads.
Triplex Springs make possible lightweight construction, permitting the highest
quality of alloy steels without excessive cost. Light weight assures great economy in
fuel and tyres.
SEEING IS BELIEVING!
IT WILL PAY YOU TO SEE THE TRIPLEX-
SPRING—COMFORTABLE OVERLAND.

Summer Night.
Out of the dust-grey pallor of the eve
The stars rose full of quiet rest;
The night leant down and breathed aw T ay the
light
Into the passionless west.
And nothing was but windy, wandering stars
And peace. Alone upon the hill
I lay and watched the cold white-petalled
clouds
Drift upward and the valley fill
With broken shadows. Strange thoughts
shaped themselves,
Shy fleeting words that would not stay;
Slow dreams fell white, like rose-petals and
stars,
And sleep came in a, gentle way.

The Creek.
Under tin; bridge by folk crossed over,
Young and old, since the early days,
The busy creek, like a restless rover,
Questing whither it knows not, strays.
Still it sings to the gums around it,
Still its waters, sun-brightened, gleam
Clear and fresh as when man first found it,
And stooping drank of its crystal stream.
Born of gullies and fronded places,
Bearing leafage its waters glide;
Who shall number or limn the faces
It has framed in its lucent tide?
Rovers coming and rovers going,
It has imaged a-many times,
Youthful faces with high hopes glowing,
Faces furiwved by cares and crimes.
Sand and pebbles its waters cover.
Leaf and bracken they mirror clear.;
Horseman, footman, robber, lover —-
Each has fashioned his image here.
Westward wending and eastward going.
Here they stooped for a moment, glassed
Clear and near in the waters flowing
On and onward, then rose and passed.
Herein imaged, none may discover
Aught that tells of a bygone day;
Florseman, footman, robber, lover— r
Each has passed like a ghost away.
Under the bridge by folk crossed over,
Prattling ever, the currents wend ;
Roving water and human rover
Each finds ever a destined end.

BRIGALOW.
A Ballad of Alfred.
As Alfred walked in Somerset.
He heard a wild bird sing:
“The morning branch is dewy wet,
And who would be a king?
Who would carry a kingdom's load
Against the great and strong,
When he might take the cowslip road
And make an April song?”
But he'set his mouth and went his way.
For who would heed what a bird might say?
As Alfred lifted harp and scrip
Beside the Danesmen’s camp,
He saw a house on the river’s lip
And there a shining lamp;
And a fire of good red wood was set
Whereon was forest meat—
“ Come in, good man. There is no let.
Come in and warm your feet.”
But he turned his head and went his way,
For the sake of a tune his hand must play.
As Alfred went to Winchester
He met a maiden fair;
And witch-dark were the eyes of her
Under her Saxon hair.
She bade him share her barley bread
And the comb-honey sweet;
And but for one thought in his head
His heart was at her feet.
So he spake her fair and went his way,
For there was nought that a king could say.
As Alfred sat in council hall —
And he was worn and grey—
He heard the voices, great and small,
That had no more to say.
But they came to him from the leafy lane
And off the windy shore;
And every voice would say again
The thing it said before.
But he bent his head in a kingly way,
For he could not turn his heart that day.
As Alfred sat with beard on knee,
Fie heard a wild bird sing;
And April in its melody
Called up and up the Spring.
And he heard the voice of a forest man
And the voice of a forest maid,
Till his heart among the hawthorn ran
In the green of the beechen glade.
And the council hall seemed far away,
For his heart would cry to the Spring that
day.
As Alfred sat in Winchester,
King by the gift of God,
Fie longed to hear the alders stir
And the tasseled willow rod;
For great of power and peace was he,
But his heart was not still—
It went with the Spring in an oaken tree
And the wind on a round hill.
And his eyes were set in a far way,
Looking the thing he could not say.
As Alfred went in solemn state
To lie where kings are laid,
A wind that was the Spring’s mate
Came up the Wessex glade.
It tossed green leaves upon the pall,
It. ruffled earl and thane;
And all the voices, great and small,
Came with the wind again.
But his mouth was set as he went his way,
For there is no word that the dead can say.

THE camel, long eulogised as “The Ship of the Desert,” is
to-day as antiquated a means of transport as the ancient
sailing barque on the High Seas.
On all roads to-day throughout the world Thornycroft Motor
Vehicles hold sway; in the Canary Islands, Thorny crofts are
bringing prosperity to the banana-growing industry, having sup-
planted the camel and the mule cart.
Australia is quick to adopt modern transport to increase her
trade, and she chooses wisely the British and Best
Motor Vehicle—Thornycroft.

WHAT MR. BRUCE IS DOING
ABOUT IT.
“Australia is confronted with the alternative of
developing the most potentially rich uninhabited
country in the world, or of being challenged in her
possession.” — Prime Minister Bruch, at the official
luncheon of the Melbourne Royal Show.
It was a very good speech; in fact, for mak-
ing a good speech over a good lunch the
spatted Prime Minister has few superiors or
jven equals. He touched on the advisability
if growing more diverse crops, with an allu-
sion to cotton and a glance at pigs. He
mentioned the multiplicity of wholesale sell-
ing agents for Australian products in London,
and how their competition often did harm to
prices, and he referred to the want of sys-
tem, whereby certain products were some-
times a glut and selling cheap, and sometimes
absent and not selling at all. He spoke of
the need for new markets, which is plain
enough ; Australia should have 50 manufac-
turing centres where there is now one, to
furnish its agriculturists with outlets. And
lie made the above remark, without which no
political pronouncement is complete. The
alternative he mentions, is. obvious. What MY.
Bruce is doing about it is less apparent or
not apparent at all.
*• * * *
Since the East-to-West job was commenced,
to traverse a stretch of purely State land of
very small settlement capacity and join up
with a decaying goldfield (all goldfields decay
sooner or later), no Government has taken
so much interest in public works as that of
Bruce-Page. One of its ambitions is to
build, at great Federal expense, a railway
through other State territory, and not promis-
ing territory either, so that there may be a
shorter line and a uniform gauge between the
decaying Western goldfield and one out of
the six State capitals. If, as is suggested,
a Port Augusta-Broken Hill line is substi-
tuted for the original idea of a Port Augusta-
Ilay line, the work will connect with a de-
caying silver-field as well as a decaying gold-
field, and will still serve purely State terri-
tory. The scheme has evoked little enthusi-
asm so far, but Bruce-Page is doing its best.
Then it is well advanced with a plan for
presenting the two large and allegedly
wealthy States of N. S. Wales and Queens-
land with a connecting State railway, most
of the bill being at the general cost of the
Commonwealth. The two States have long
been pledged to each other to do this work
themselves, but by common consent they lay
low and waited and pulled strings in the
hope of passing on the liability, and now it
seems to be successfully passed. The result will
be a fairly short and fairly straight one-gauge
route between the decaying Westralian gold-
field above specified and tico out of the six
State capitals. It is reckoned that Queens-
land will benefit by the arrangement to the
extent of £1,400.000, in the sense that the
work done in that State will be worth
£1,800,000, while the bill presented to that
State will be a fraction over £400,000. Tas-
mania came recently on the scene extending a
dilapidated hat and a plea for assistance. Its
case was that it and the Northern Territory
are the only sections of the Commonwealth
which have no connection with the outer
world except by sea, and that a Navigation
Act, which is too big and pompous
for the circumstances, has brought most
serious commercial trouble on both of them,
marine strikes being a further disaster in
Tasmania’s case. Tasmania was promised
some aid in the patronising and semi-con-
temptuous fashion which is reserved for poor
relations. But the two big mainland States
make almost a favor of allowing the Common-
wealth to build expensive railways for them,
inasmuch as they are permitting it to bear a
hand with “a great national work.” Their
attitude is rather that of a strong man with
a hatchet than a mendicant with a lmt.
* * * *
But. though Australia is confronted, as a
condition of its very existence, with the
necessity of “developing the most potentially
rich uninhabited country in the world,” the
biggest and most potential part of it has no
definite place in the Bruce-Page programme.
That straight line drawn on the map from
Brisbane to. Perth, which cuts off the devel-
oped one-third or one-quarter of Australia
from the almost undeveloped balance, remains
the. limit of the Bruce-Page Government’s
activities. In the little area south of the
magic streak it is prepared to toil like a
beaver and spend money on public works
with the lavishness of an Elagaisalus buy-
ing drinks for all hands. In the big area
north it is torpid like its predecessors,
though it is up north that the big Federal
estate lies, and the great danger, and the
great undevelopment; and there the abori-
gines have just given a remarkable adver-
tisement of the lack of effective occupation
which the world can’t but hear about. The
180tli degree, on which the progress of the
good ship San Gregorio was stopped for four
centuries by reason of a misunderstanding
with its patron, saint, wasn’t more difficult
than that invisible barrier. There is some
talk of a dead-end line as far as the southern
limits of. the Territory, as a sop to S. Aus-
tralia if it will cease to oppose the building of
the rest of the pet Federal railway from the
decaying goldfield already hinted at to Syd-
ney. Nobody is likely to take this talk seri-
ously until the work is really started, and
started as a complete undertaking and not
an apologetic dead-end. The idea is so con-
trary to all precedent that even the unusu-
ally good reputation for veracity enjoyed by
the Bruce-Page Government is not sufficient
to inspire faith. It is frequently alleged in dis-
paragement that undeveloped Australia is in
a general way nothing better than pastoral
country. This may be true or it may be a
hasty conclusion. If it is true there is
satisfaction in the thought that the pastoral
industry yields a great deal more per em-
ployee than agriculture, and that there is
room for a lot more of it than w r e have, and
that there would be joy in the vigorous
settlement of a country where progress
wouldn’t be constantly interrupted by the
sonorous bray of somebody anxious to plant
a million wheat-farmers on a million farms.
The possibilities of the “potentially rich,
uninhabited North,” and the way to develop
them, may be inferred from the fact that the
narrow eastern tropical strip, which a rail-
way connects with the other States, had
181,397 inhabitants on census day, while
the very much larger tropical centre and
west, lacking such a connection, had 9465.
When the Bruce-Page Ministry can spare
an hour from distributing costly loan works
to the small end of Australia and brassy
burnished platitudes to. the big end, it might
consider these figures with an eye to business.
THE FUTURE OF FEDERAL
PARTIES.
There was a report in Melbourne recently
that the Prime Minister was anxious to re-
suscitate the so-called Liberal party, which
idiotically allowed itself to be absorbed by
the weaker of two Labor factions in 1917,
when, by attending to its own concerns while
the combatants were fighting it out, it could
have promenaded into power. He had dis-
cussed the matter, it was said, with Watt,
the Speaker, and Peacock, then Premier
of Victoria, and it was all arranged. On
a certain day the Nationalist party would
melt into darkness, like the vanishing lady
in the trick, and reappear, winking at the
audience, as the Liberal party. Honest
citizens, devoted to “the great outstanding
and basic principles of Nationalism,” which,
it seems, are “loyalty to the King, mainten-
ance of the unity of the British Empire, and
the continuance of constitutional govern-
ment,” would read in the paper that they
had acquired another label. Facile politi-
cians like Pearce, who expounded the sacred
principles as Laborites before 1917 and as
Nationalists since, would continue to expound
them as Liberals. And the transformation
would be effected by the simple magic of a
resolution.
* * * *
It was a picturesque story, but the Prime
Minister did not confirm it in liis address to
the Victorian Nationalist Federation at Mel-
bourne last week. On the contrary, he re-
affirmed his belief in the Nationalist party,
“and the great ideals for which it stands.”
His devotion was such that if Nationalism
dian’t exist there would be no place for him
in politics, since the new Laborism was
abominable and he couldn’t accept “Liberal-
ism tinged with Conservatism, as it was
known in this country.” To the National-
ist party the people owed “an undying debt
of gratitude for what it did during the war.”
Somebody might have replied that the party
thus lauded did not arrive until the war was
2J years old, and that its one conspicuous
achievement during the subsequent period,
although it had commanding majorities in
both Houses, was to refer the question of
national service—the responsibility for which
was undertaken by Parliament in Britain
and by the President in the U.S.A. —to an
uninformed electorate. A rude stranger
would likewise have remarked that National-
ism had been responsible since the peace for
appalling losses in steamers, war-service
homes, and all manner of Government pools,
and for the surrender of soldier-settlement,
which could have been made a means of
scientifically developing the Commonwealth’s
own Northern Territory, to six wasteful and
provincial-minded State Governments —and
a fine mess they have made of it! But
there were no rude strangers present, so
Mr. Bruce’s narrative of his party’s war
record, and of the stupendous sacrifices made
by Labor politicians who joined it, and
thereby remained in office or retained their
seats, was not disputed.
* * * *
Unhappily the transcendent virtues of
Nationalism are imperfectly appreciated.
The party, as the Prime Minister admits, is
suffering from “apathy, disunity and dis-
organisation,” a disheartening combination.
Its “objects are so great that it is only neces-
sary to make the people understand them
to receive an overwhelming measure of sup-
port.” Yet the plain fact is that the people,
in their blindness or perversity, are increas-
ingly voting for its opponents. The worst
foe is the Labor party, which is organised
and confident, and whose recent successes in
State politics will be crowned with a Federal
triumph if the Nationalists don’t abandon
their shrinking modesty and get their sur-
passing merits known. But there are
other parties equally sinister—“new parties
which do not hesitate to admit that their
object is to hold the balance of power and
gain their ends by a species of political black-
mail.” There is a certain new party with
which the Nationalists are associated in the
Government, and whose leader has signed an
election agreement which has aroused some
feeling; but the Prime Minister, Dr. Page
explains, hadn’t that party in mind—his
thoughts evidently wandered for a moment
to the political situation in Kurdistan, or
it might have been Kalamazoo. Be that
as it may, it is a flat and unprofitable busi-
ness to rail against new parties. They have
a right to exist if the people want them.
And the abuses of power complained of by
the Prime Minister could be very simply
prevented. There would be no blackmail-
ing by third parties if Australia had elective
Ministry's. Neither would there be any call
for coalitions in which principle is sacrificed
to expediency and one side is jealous or sus-
picious of the other, nor for undemocratic
pacts. Stewart, M.11.R. for Wimmera,
spoke interestingly on this subject last
week:—-
The real cause of the political instability of the
country is the present system of party government
and Cabinet responsibility. Personally I believe
that elective Ministries should be given a trial, be-
cause of the abuses of the present system. 1 also
advocate the extension of the committee system in
Parliament. The few committees that now exist are
elected on a proportional basis, and their singleminded
object is always to ensure that fault cannot be
found with their actions and decisions.
Stewart’s testimony is of value, consider-
ing that he sat on the Treasury bench for 18
months, and resigned rather than acquiesce
in a pact which affirms that his third party
has no right to contest seats which it thinks
it can win. As the head of a party which
claims to stand for “the* interests of the
whole of the people, irrespective of class or
section,” Mr. Bruce shouldn’t be above sup-
porting elective Ministries. If he led one
now he would not have to apologise for two
depressing duds now in high office, nor
would a few mischievous Foreign-traders be
able to prevent the question of building the
second 10.000-ton cruiser in Australia, which
a large majority of members is known to
favor, from being put to the vote. Neither
would the public smile grimly when it reads
that Nationalism believes in the right of
independent judgment and reflects that Lox-
ton, M.L.A. for Ryde. has been threatened
with expulsion from the party for speaking
his mind about the Fuller Government’s
arrangement with a cement company; also
that when five Victorian Nationalists voted
against the Peacock Government’s Redis-
tribution of Seats Bill, on the ground that it
was unjust to their constituents, the bosses
of the Nationalist Federation tried to hound
them out of public life. The Prime Minis-
ter has many attractive qualities, but his
party will have to show by its deeds that it
trusts the people and has something more
to put before them than old junk about
loyalty, otherwise some chilling experiences
are in store for it —and him. Australia
doesn’t really believe in the new Labor party
or the cloudy doctrines it has imported from
Russia, Germany, France, Jerusalem and
Thibet. But the alternative is so uninspir-
ing.
THE MENACE OF INVERTED
BOLSHEVISM.
One of the strongest indications that all is
not well in the family circle of father Bull
is to be found in the rapid growth in import-
ance of that utterly un-English institution
which wears on its shirt, with sublime indif-
ference to ridicule, the monogram “8.F.” A
little while ago this organisation was airily
dismissed by the newspapers; to-day it is re-
ceiving guarded endorsement from some and
bitter condemnation from others. A N. S.
Wales knight arrived back from Wonderland
the other day and unloaded his agitated mind
to this effect:—
England is in a bad way. Employers are being
hard hit with socialistic trade intolerance, and Eng-
land is being made the dumping-ground of the foreign
manufacturer. She is doped with doles while tens of
thousands of acres of land are idle or partially idle,
awaiting profitable labor. At Westminster „there are
men in high office of Imperial control without a
mandate from the people. The hour demands a man
with the power of Oliver Cromwell and Benito
Mussolini boiled _ into one. There are no less than
VO,OOO Fascists in London watching developments,
and ready to strike when the hour comes.
Whatever is to be thought of the White
Knight’s proposed culinary remedy for poli-
tical and economic disorders, there is no
doubt his picture of the state of affairs in
Britain is substantially true. The Prince of
Wales is alleged to have received a deputa-
tion from the Fascisti, who claim they em-
brace all classes of society, from peers to
peasants. According to its own official pam-
phlets, the organisation has directorships of
units, transports, propaganda and publicity.
The transport service consists of owner-
drivers, motor-cyclists, waggon-drivers and
cyclists, to maintain communication in case
of revolution. The propaganda department’s
duty is to call the attention of the units to
existing Bolshevik activities in their dis-
tricts which may have escaped public notice,
the.combative measures to be taken being left
entirely in the units’ hands. The object of
the organisation, it is stated, is to preserve
law and order and to prevent the terrorising
of the country by the forces of Red Revolu-
tion which are seeking to overthrow society
and plunge Britain into the state of anarchy
and confusion that lias involved Russia in
ruin. This is precisely the declaration the
Italian Fascists made when they set out to
tidy things up in Italy; and 'it might be
worth while retracing the history of their
efforts in the cause of law and order.
* * * »
The Parliament which had just been
elected in Italy consisted of a Popular or
Catholic party of 100 deputies and a Social-
ist party of 156, and the Premier, the well-
meaning Nitti, could obtain a working majo-
rity only with the assistance of one or other
of his opponents. The elections had been
hopelessly corrupt, and there seemed no pros-
pect of a dissolution doing anything else but
return the parties in the same strength, with
perhaps a slight change of personnel. The
problems the Parliament were called upon to
solve demanded statesmanship. The war had
left Italy exhausted, with a huge army un-
absorbed. The annihilation of Austria and
the hamstringing of Germany had destroyed
two of its best markets. Lack of shipping
and America’s refusal to accommodate un-
limited immigration closed one possible
channel of relief. Owing to Italy's depend-
ence on imported food and raw material, the
low exchange value of the lira acted as effici-
ently as a submarine blockade; consequently
everything was subsidised to maintain an
artificial equilibrium. It was costing the
State a thousand million lire a year to keep
the price of bread at only three times what is
was before the war, and all State enterprises
were being run at an enormous loss and with
quite comical inefficiency. Successive loans
were floated, but owing to currency deprecia-
tion the money melted like fairy gold almost
before the lists were closed. Police reprisals
followed strikes and strikes followed repri-
sals. The police began to show reluctance to
shoot down their fellow-countrymen, and the
military were suspected of Bolshevik lean-
ings ; so a flying corps of bersagliere was
employed to suppress the demonstrating
workmen. The fat but foresighted Nitti saw
the danger and struggled to apply construc-
tive remedies; but time, economic pressure
and the fierce passions it had engendered
were against him. The amiable opportunist
Giolitti resumed control, and finding the
tide setting w r ell against him, decided there
was less exertion involved in drifting with it.
When the employers locked their workmen
out he let them do it, and when the workmen
seized the factories he let them do that too.
The fantastic D’Annunzio left off writing
socialist sermons from Fiume at this crucial
moment and recruited the dregs of the Italian
cities in t!»e cause of law and order. Being
a poet he did not make a job of it, and the
more ruthless Mussolini took over and
welded the Black Shirts into an effective
striking force. The whisper of “Fascisti”
went over the tormented land, and pension
landladies sighed happily and said that now
servants would be shown their place. In an
atmosphere of lyric enthusiasm the Fascisti
administered castor oil and cudgels to the re-
calcitrant, and Mussolini was enthroned as
dictator with a mandate to trample on the
decaying corpse of Liberalism. The corpse
showed so little signs of being permanently
dead that after a year of the trampling pro-
cess it compelled Mussolini to defer to pop-
ular superstitions about democracy so far as
to hold a faked election, resulting in the over-
whelming success of the Fascist party. But
this, too, failed to pacify the corpse, nor did
the bombing of anti-Fascist newspapers, the
murder of several thousand political oppo-
nents and wholesale massacres serve to
placate it. The Fascist Commissioner of
Police telegraphed to Mussolini that
“460 officers are ready to kill and to die
for the Fatherland and for Fascism,” and
the police of Rome stood by while prominent
citizens were kidnapped or cudgelled in the
public streets. Nevertheless, the corpse was
not intimidated, and still there were men with
courage to speak on its behalf. The shock
caused by the murder of Matteotti because
he was believed to hold documents proving
corruption against prominent Fascists mobi-
lised public opinion against Mussolini, and
he has been compelled to promise a return
to the system of government which he himself
destroyed. Tet Fascism is not likely to give
up its sinister control without the bloodiest
of struggles. None of the problems which
beset the Italy of 1920 are absent in 1924.
and many of them are probably a good deal
worse. Fascism as a remedy has proved
itself a dismal failure.
* * * *
There are close analogies between pre-
Fascist Italy and the Britain of to-day. The
Ram«ay Macshuffle Government repre-
sents a minority and rules by favor of its op-
ponents in the House. One and a half million
British unemployed subsisting on doles repre-
sent the army which Italy was afraid to
demobilise because it had no means of em-
ploying them. Britain in 1924, like Italy m
1920. is temporarily if not permanently over-
populated, and the doubling of the present


rate of immigration would not even relieve the
land of the natural annual increase. The
re-establishment of German industry is pro-
posed, just as it was proposed by Nitti in
1920; but since the Versailles Treaty and
currency inflation have converted the Ger-
mans into a coolie nation, able by long hours
and low wages to undercut the British work-
man, it looks a dangerous and dubious ex-
pedient. Of course .there are differences
between the Italian and the Anglo-Saxon tem-
peraments/but temperament will not shift a
human surplus of a million overseas. Looked
at broadly it was the fecundity of the Rus-
sian mother which caused the Russian revo-
lution. Economic causes have brought about
the same effect in England. If the Mac-
rhuffle Government grapples succesfully
with this tremendous problem, it will earn
the thanks of all who hold by democratic in-
stitutions. If it fumbles the job—and it has
done very little else but fumble since it first
took office —it will make the Fascist madness
possible and men will live to curse it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Arthur Cocks’s Melancholy Budget.
lx short, it is like the rest of the Min-
isterial doings—mildly presentable and con-
taining no new sin, but as usual as a wet
Sunday and as unenterprising as an elderly
oyster. One or two tax remissions are
granted, and they are of the benevolent sort.
One concerns the stamp on receipts for
wages, which was an oppressive device and
a widespread nuisance, and another relaxes
the heavy stamp duty on mortgages, which
was devised to punish a person for not hav-
ing money enough to build or buy bis own
house when he couldn’t rent one and didn’t
care to sleep out. But the Budget in gen-
eral is a thriftless shuffle, a taking of the
line of least resistance, and a shifty avoid-
ance of the evil day. The most notable
shuffles may be summarised in this wise:—
The annual surplus, which is the only thing that
the Ma State has to depend on for the removal of
the heroic old permanent deficit, has become a
vanishing institution. It was £803,508 in the
Ministry’s first year; £100,390 in the year just
closed; and for the j ear just opened it is expected
to be £8289. To send an item like that in pursuit
of a shortage of £2,674,365 is much the same as
sending one small missionary to convert China.
There is still no visible provision for a sinking
fund. The revenue nominally pays £350,000 a year
into such a fund, but the fund has to pay it back in
reduction of the accumulated shortage when there is
a shortage, and only in two years since 1886 has
there been anything else. Still it must be admitted
in fairness that some real and rather unaccountable
sums are paid out of revenue to cope with the
monster debt. These recent contributions are re-

I he biggest of these masses of figures is hardly

It is stated that the “public debt proper” increased
during the year by £26,922,418. But against this
it appears that the last £10,000,000 loan, or most
of it, isn’t spent yet. Even that leaves the situa-
tion pretty horrible. It makes the total debt
£210,493,974, saying nothing of “securities issued
in payment for estates acquired under the Closer
Settlement Act.” Why this item is left out is more
or less of a mystery.
N. S. Wales has far the biggest debt and far the
smallest sinking fund among the States. Said fund
(about £450,000) is much less than half that of
lasmania, though Tassy owes only about one-ninth
as much. The Ma State’s sinking fund was much
larger in 1912 than it is now, and the debt then
was less than half its present dimensions.
The annual interest liability made a notable
jump of over £700,000 and was, at June 30,
£9,112,000 per annum. A further increase of
£828,000 is expected this year, so at next June
the Ma State should be paying out as interest on
dead horse almost exactly £10,000,000 every 12
months. When last century closed the entire State
expenditure was less than that, but there has been
a mad-and-merry, wild-and-woolly time since last
century closed. Next year the remitted taxes should
be about due to go on again.
There is a lack of information about how the
latest borrowings were applied, but the next batch
of statistics will doubtless fill the gap. The Gov-
ernment Statist classifies the N.S.W. loan spendings
first as “Reproductive Works,” and the term “re-
productive” covers railways and tramways, water
supply and sewerage (including water conservation
and irrigation), and harbors and rivers (including
docks, resumptions, etc.). That is fairly compre-
hensive, especially the “etc.” But there are also
"Other Works and Services,” which presumably con-
sist of expenditures so profitless that the figure official
wouldn’t sleep at nights if he even called them “etc.”
in the five financial years to June 1923, £15,985,268
of expensive loan money was put into “Other Works
and Services,” nearly half of it in 1921, when the
Dooleys were maddest and the McTiernans were
dancing their best by the light of the full moon.
It will be interesting to learn in due course how
" Other Works and Services” are keeping their end up.
Things are better in some respects than they
were under the Dooleys, but they are
assuredly not improving fast enough. If a
large wild animal, which may be taken to
typify Financial Disaster, is overhauling its
prey at the rate of one mile per hour, little
is gained by the prey adding 50ft. per hour
to its pace. The problem of the future may
be put this way, among others (there are
plenty of ways). Supposing a State, bv
■spending practically £17,000,000 of loan
money in a year, creates a chronic boom
condition which pushes the ordinary revenue
up to £37,000.000. so that it has £54,000,000
m all to spend during the year, then assum-
ing that something cuts off the £17,000,000,
for the time or permanently, and the total
income goes down to £37,000,000 ; and further
assuming that the destruction of the loan
boom brings the ordinary revenue down to
normal (say, £20,000.000 or £25,000,000)
supposing these quite possible events to
happen, what kind of cataclysm do the
Holmans and Dooleys and Fullers think
they are preparing? And what do they think
history will say about them?

The Navigation Act.
The Australian Navigation Act is doubtless
a noble and fatherly piece of legislation, but
it is too costly and sumptuous to suit the
case of a great stretch of poorly developed or
wholly undeveloped and far from wealthy
coast. A recent report set forth that an Aus-
tralian ship of 5800 tons has now to carry a
larger crew than an 8800-tonner of Britain,
Norway, Holland, Sweden, France or the
United States, and that it costs more to run
—in four of the above cases more than twice
as much to run, and in one instance over
thrice as much. If it becomes a matter of
sending the most expensive ship to call at the
smallest ports—especially if, as in the case
of such a run as that from Townsville or
Cairns to Darwin, it is something like a
record coastal stretch between ports —the
small place is likely to be cut out of the itin-
erary. If it is a place where the local A.W.U.
bosses receive a ship very much as brigands
welcome a traveller or cannibals a new mis-
sionary, it is still more likely to be cut out.
Then the little coastal town that lias none
but sea communication, in place of expanding
into a city *ends to be first a hamlet and
then a ruin. At one time cheap foreign ships
used to take a spot like Darwin in their
stride, do a little business, and pass on. But
one tendency of the policy of reserving the
Australian coastal trade for Australian ships
was to make it almost necessary that a port
such as Darwin or Wyndham should be re-
garded as a terminus instead of a platform
station, and these isolated settlements, with
no well-developed hinterland, are not big
enough for termini. The Act makes provision
for the licensing of foreign ships to do way-
side jobs on the Australian coast when the
local ship supply is short, but as that in-
volves the observance of expensive Austra-
lian regulations there is little inducement to
patrol long stretches of almost uninhabited
shore-line. The Labor members of a Royal
Commission on Navigation lately declared in
passionate terms that the decline of such
ports as Albany, Geraldton, Darwin and
Hobart is not due in any way to the Act; and
they would probably have been expelled from
the party if they had said anything else.
What it was due to they didn’t explain. But
the fact remains that a great area of North
Australian sea has become practically de-
serted save by a pair of subsidised tubs, and
that the law on a long line of deserted shore
appears to be of very minor account. The
commendable idea that it is good to preserve
the Australian inter-State trade for Austra-
lian ships was copied from the United States,
but like the Monroe doctrine, which might
also have been copied, it was a big thing for
a small, scattered community to take over.
The U.S. includes no State corresponding
with Tasmania, which is wholly dependent
on the sea. It contains not one port which
hasn’t a railway from the interior to bring
trade to its wharves. It has no terrace of
shore towns resembling Roebourne, Broome,
Derby. Wyndham and Borroloola, which de-
pend for their future on ships, but have so
little to offer in ' the present that even the
dropping in of a junk would be an event not
to be despised. It has no vast bald patches
of sea front, and no hopelessly unprofitable
ports, and it has about 36 times the Common-
wealth’s stock of shipping to supply its
wants. The conditions are so dissimilar as
to make it look possible that this country’s
whole-hearted imitation of Uncle was prema-
ture.

Communications and Defence.
In the general delight and surprise over
wireless communication between Australia
and the Cold Country, which, by the way,
hasn’t communicated anything up to date
except some light conversation between
Signor Marconi and an odd listener-in, the
steady improvement of the old under-water
method is being lost sight of. When the
war broke out the cable services were on
the eve of a radical transformation. War
conditions inundated them with four times
the traffic they were built to handle, while
shortage of men and material and the con-
verting of production in Britain to wartime
purposes prevented any expansion. Never-
theless they did invaluable service, and mili-
tary requirements never suffered. As soon
as things returned to normal they got busy
on improvements. Down fo three or four
years ago the antiquated method of hand
transmission and repetition from one station
to another over the long route from London
to Australia was still largely in vogue. To-
day the message is perforated in London by
a typist working an instrument whose key-
board is similar to an ordinary typewriter.
The perforated signals are automatically
transmitted through relay stations and de-
livered in Australia some three hours later
as printed type without the further inter-
position of fallible human hands. Increased
speed and accuracy were thereby gained. The
fundamental factor limiting the speed at
which signals could be pushed through the
wire, however, still remained. Like a garden
hose, the cable has to fill itself with the
necessary juice before it delivers any at the
other end, and must empty itself after the
transmission of one impulse before it can
accommodate another. The periods it takes
to do this are calculated in thousandths of a
second, but they are slow enough to make
the maximum speed of a cable under ordi-
nary conditions much lower than a landline,
which is filled and emptied more rapidly
than a glass of beer on the stroke of six.
Since the submarine cables were first laid 50
years ago, their speed has been improved
more than 100 per cent, by means of various
emptying devices ; but these were only applic-
able at the shore-ends. Self-emptiers were
inserted experimentally at intervals along
some cables, but they were bulky and intro-
duced new problems when a faulty or broken
cable had to be grappled and lifted to the
surface of a stormy sea by a little cockle-
shell of a tossing cable steamer. A German
proposed the insertion of a metal alloy
having the quality of neutralising the lagging
effect, and it has been tried on some cables,
resulting in an enormous increase in speed:
but the cable companies are not yet satis
fied that its properties are permanent. The
invention of Prof. Wagner, recently cabled,
which claims to multiply present speeds by
five, is probably along these lines. If it proves
successful the under-water method will have
an advantage over the aerial one which it
will take wireless a lot of hard thinking to
catch up. There are several reasons why
the Commonwealth Government, which is a
big shareholder in the Pacific Cable, should
not be too hasty about spending several hun-
dred thousands on a beam wireless station
until the new method has proved its superior-
ity. It is not yet proven that the beam can
work satisfactorily more than six or eight
hours daily, whereas the cables work the
clock round, suffer total interruption only at
intervals of years, and are provided with
alternative routes which insure continuity;
the beam is subject much more than cables
to atmospheric cussedness; and although it
is not such a chronic disseminator of its
tidings as non-directional wireless, it can be
tapped over a wide area by anyone who cares
to listen-in with a receiver concealed in his
hip-pocket; and that, since nobody yet has
succeeded in devising an undecipherable code,
renders it absolutely useless for military pur-
poses. It is also possible that it may be
ignominiously jambed into silence by a
higher-powered enemy station the instant war
breaks out. It may, of course, be argued
that a country can be isolated in time of
war by the cutting of its cables; but that
could only be done permanently when the
country concerned had lost command of the
seas. If Australia were that country, the
only use she would have for her wireless sta-
tions would be to sing her swan-song to the
outside world.

“Jobs—Not Employment.”
The late David Bowman, a former Queens-
land Labor leader, used to say, in the days
of the pure-merino Tory regime, that “un-
employment is the real test of government.”
If this be so, then the present Labor regime
in Queensland is condemned; for as the years
go by the out-of-works continually increase
in numbers, and the Government’s own
documents show conclusively that the worker
suffers far worse from want of employment
under Laborism than ever he did under
“Toryism.” The annual report of the Direc-
tor of Labor reveals that in the last financial
year there were 83,806 applications for work,
but employment could be found for only
14,061. That is to say, something like one
applicant out of six was provided for. And
a great deal of the so-called “employment”
is worse in its ultimate effects than the
admitted unemployment, for it only affords
“work” of a non-reproductive nature that
spells in the long run Treasury impoverish-
ment, heavy taxation and more unemploy-
ment again. A deputation of out-of-works
approached a Minister some time ago in
Toowoomba. “But,” said that desperate and
hard-pushed man, “I cannot find employment
for you at present.” “We don’t want em-
ployment,” promptly replied a deputationist
—“we only want jobs!” Apparently the
finding even of jobs has become a task be-
yond the powers of the Queensland Ministry.
And naturally; for any country that treats
employers as semi-criminals who .want watch-
ing and penalising to restrain their mis-
chievous activities is bound to meet its
Nemesis in the long run. The number of
persons employed in Queensland factories on
March 31, 1924, was 35,322, as compared
with 35.598 in 1923, a decrease of nearly
300. Evidently men don’t want to extend
their workshops and factories in Bananaland
because the moment they do so their apparent
prosperity makes them an object of sus-
picion, and the governing Socialists get
ready to smite them with their heaviest avail-
able bludgeon. And Queensland’s agricultural
industries —butter, cheese, wheat, maize and
fruit —are in a far less prosperous condition
than they should be, because the want of
prosperity in the secondary or manufactur-
ing industries deprives them of their only
really profitable market—the market in their
own coastal towns. Tasmania, with only
about one-fourth of Queensland’s population,
has nearly doubled its factory employees
since 1914, and bids fair to go on increasing
them: but Southern capital cannot be ex-
pected to rush up into Queensland so long
as, in spite of that State’s splendid resources,
taxation (State) on the larger incomes from
property is about three times as heavy as
it is in Victoria. And things are going
steadily worse. The interest bill for the
current year will reach, roughly, to four
millions, and the amount of estimated loan
expenditure for the same time is about the
same. Without this importation of bor-
rowed millions the payment of the equivalent
amount of interest would be well nigh an
impossibility. It is the purest of piffle to
assert that the loan moneys will be expended
on reproductive works, for new railways in
the northern State cannot bring in 1 per
cent, on capital borrowed at over 5 per cent.,
while such works as the Dawson Valley irri-
gation scheme are going to be almost entirely
a charge on Consolidated Revenue.

Ten Commandments for Good
Australians.
Wallace Nelson is the Moses who com-
mits this newer decalogue to The Bul-
letin’s tablets:—
I. —Never forget that in encouraging Australian in-
dustry you are helping yourself, for you are helping
to increase prosperity, and prosperity, like sunshine,
radiates everywhere.
11. —When you purchase from abroad you send as
much wealth out of the country as you bring into it.
But when you purchase at home both the goods and
the purchase money remain in the country.
ll.—ln these days, when a war means piracy on
the high seas, no country is secure which depends for
its subsistence on oversea trade. Only the self-
supporting countries are safe.
IV. —The man who is ashamed to wear Australian
boots, or an Australian hat, or an Australian suit of
clothes made of Australian cloth, is really ashamed of
Australia. And the country which cannot supply its
own needs, with its own labor, with all the raw
material at hand, is a country for which one has
reason to blush.
V. —ln supporting Australian industry the Austra-
lian is only doing for his country what other people
all over the world are doing for theirs. He is not
doing a wrong; he is merely performing a duty and
exercising a right.
VI. —No country can reach the highest degree cf
development and utilise all its talents if its industrial
activities are confined to a few primary industries.
Complete national development is impossible without
variety of employment, and variety of employment
implies that a nation is striving as far as possible to
supply its own needs with its own labor.
HI.—A man can serve his country in many ways.
He can serve it by singing songs about it, or by
making speeches about it. Some people seem to
think that there is no other way. He can serve it by
dying for it. He can also serve it by living for it.
But in the long run he can render it no greater ser-
vice than by assisting it to earn its living—by buying
its goods and backing its enterprises.
I HI. Australia could easily become a self-support-
ing country. It has the raw material. It has the
labor. It chiefly wants the demand—and that every
man and woman of us can help to provide.
IX. —The manufacturer in Australia has a special
claim to support. He is to a great extent a pioneer.
He is a man of courage. He has faith in his country
and his people, and every Australian should try to
prove to him that his faith is justified.
X. —Every Australian ought to remember that Aus-
tralia, like every other country, must depend for its
support and protection on its own people. Nobody
will care for Australia—if Australians do not care
for it. Nobody will save it —unless Australians save
it. And every Australian who is not helping to save
it. is helping to damn it.

The Doctrine of the Heretic and the
Relapsed Heretic.
The Council of the League of Nations is a
well-intentioned body of much dignity and
no power, and it is claimed on its behalf
that its mediation has already averted two
or three wars—where the stakes were small
and the parties were gentle-mannered folk,
like the Finns and Swedes, who didn’t really
intend to fight and were glad to have their
debate settled without humiliation on either
side. But the other day the League tried
its pacific arts where the struggle is
really one of life and death, the attacker
being Soviet Russia (7,000,000 sq. miles
and 132,000,000 inhabitants) and the de-
fender Georgia (area, 25,760 sq. miles, and
population about 2,400,000). The time
seemed opportune for interference, as the
Soviet Government wants admission to the
League and badly wants admission to the
Anglo-French money market and a big loan
of the hated capitalists’ money. But the
natural ferocity of the creature overcame his
prudence and he replied with something
between a curse and an expectoration bid-
ding the League mind its own business, and
asserting the right of every slave-owner to
wallop his own chattel. The attitude of the
real Communist is a copy of the worst
aspect of the Church in the worst days of
darkness and ignorance, and it may be sum-
marised in two propositions :
Whoever lives outside the infallible Communist
faith is a heretic with whom no terms need be kept,
and any methods, however violent, may be justifiably
employed in his conversion, for the glory of the faith
and the good of the sufferer’s soul.
And if the convert breaks away, or attempts to
break away, he is a relapsed heretic, and nothing in
or out of Hell is too bad for him.
Even in Australia, where Bolshevism is still
struggling in its initial stages, no disguise
is made of the doctrine that no faith need
be kept with heretics, and that if a treaty
is made it should be merely with a view to
white-anting the other party’s organisation
and resuming hostilities. Nor is any secret
made of the strenuous Communist belief in
conversion of unbelievers by violence. Where
Communism is really in power these old In-
quisition ideas are practised most earnestly,
and Georgia is in the second or “relapsed
heretic” stage. That very ancient State (its
record goes back beyond Alexander the
Great) was a Russian province for 115 years
before the empire broke, so it was a newer
possession than Poland and about as old a
one as Finland. Like them it resumed its
independence after the breakage. Its repub-
lican Government and its Assembly, elected
by “direct, equal, universal, secret and pro-
portional voting of citizens of both sexes,”
were recognised by the civilised Powers.
Then the usual Communist insurrection, en-
gineered from Moscow as Australia’s is in-
tended to be, upset the Assembly and the
Government, and Georgia was furnished with
Russian institutions and added to the Bol-
shevik group. In its furious reply to the
League of Nations Council the Moscow Gov-
ernment declared that, by reason of this
violent and non-Parliamentary upheaval of
three years ago, Georgia is “a free and volun-
tary associate of the union of Soviet repub-
lics”—free, that is, to come in but not to
go out. Its attempt to revert to its old
institutions was held at Moscow to brand
it with two unforgivable sins—it was “coun-
ter-revolutionary,” and it was heretic to the
infallible faith of Bolshevism. Its position,
in fact, became that of the Albigenses in the
thirteenth century. The first definite news
of war was that a well-equipped Soviet army
was desolating the heretic land, and that
“commissaries” of the right sort had been
sent to restore order. The next was that
Tifiis, the one fairly big city in those parts,
had been stormed, that hundreds of leading
inhabitants had been immediately executed
(so immediately that any theory of trial is
ruled out), that the prisons were full, and
that the commissaries were attending to busi-
ness. Then for a while the SOS signal
ceased, just as it ceases at sea when the ship
goes down. Georgia is in a singularly dis-
astrous position, the same as Armenia. Its
only neighbors which count are Russia and
Turkey, and when the short-sighted incom-
petents who compiled the Lausanne treaty
handed back the Dardanelles and Bosphorus
to the dismal old Turk they deprived them-
selves of all legal right to send the only
assistance that they could otherwise have
sent—the marine variety—to the oppressed
Christian races who border on the Black Sea.
The tragedy of Georgia is only one among
many; but in a sidelong fashion they have
all an interest for Australia. They show
what “freedom” under the Soviet form of
government really amounts to, and what
manner of men they are whom the Gardens
and other Communists of Australia are
accepting as their guides and commanders.

Men Plus Machines.
According to figures recently compiled, it
costs as much to navigate 64 tons of Austra-
lian shipping over the waves Britannia is
supposed to rule as it does 20 tons of Japan-
ese ; and a Japanese vessel of 8800 tons re
quires only 61 little brown people to man her.
while an Australian ship of 5800 tons re-
quires the ministrations of 50 burly white
Australians. There was a time when the
Asiatic menace was more bogey than real,
and travellers returned from “the East” witli
renewed faith in their own land. The very
sight of the gigantic draught horses on the
wharves after the footling little rats of Asi-
atic ponies inspired confidence. The lean,
laconic, purposeful Australian lumper, after
the chattering riot of native labor, was as a
tower of silent strength. There was a sense
of calm direction about trams, ti-ains and
ferries moving off on their appointed tasks
which was entirely absent from the shambling
traffickings of Asia; and the frank stare of

Managing Director,
the Australian flapper seemed to register
more energy and purpose in the race than
the veiled glance of Oriental women. Cer-
tainly the same childish incompetency still
exists in Asia. Precisely the same unwieldy
junk rolls out of Macassar on the west mon-
soon as carried Marco Polo and his Chinese
princess 800 years ago. The Japanese pea-
sant still spins cotton fabrics at hand-looms
in mountain villages. But these things are
fast-vanishing relics of a religious conserva-
tism which is rapidly being corrupted by the
industrial missionaries from the West. The
junks have to struggle for the scraps that
fall from the steamship companies’ tables,
and whole villages are being emptied to
supply the labor needs of factories in Osaka
and Shanghai. There is nothing esoteric in
mechanical efficiency. The Dyak boring out
a blowpipe exercises as much intelligence and
skill as an Australian lathe-worker at Lith-
gow. At the elbows of both are the accumulated
experience of centuries, and the creative initia-
tive which makes their work possible comes
from the brains of others. There is no essen-
tial difference between throwing a spear and
pulling over the lever which sets a 10,000-
watt dynamo in action, and an intelli-
gent savage can be taught to turn
a switch or “clean a spark” as easily
as a university graduate can. Give
a motor rickshaw to the panting beast
of burden who makes the streets of Singa-
pore a spectacle of shame, and he is trans-
formed into a godlike thing of magic speed.
In . the rougher kinds of manual labor the
Asiatic is probably still the white man’s in-
ferior—his numbers make for slackness and
inefficiency, just as the union doctrine of
equal output does. But put him in front of
a machine, and he becomes the white man’s
equal. And he takes to the machine like a
duck to water. The first railway laid down
in China was bought up by the mandarins
and thrown into the sea as if it were some
poisonous serpent: native-owned and native-
built railroads now pay dividends that would
turn an Australian Railways Commissioner
green with envy. Japan has equipped her-
self with modern machinery with a speed that
has astonished the world. China is follow-
ing suit. Neither country is hampered by
any doctrine of a minimum output for a
maximum wage. Both countries are blessed
or cursed with a labor market so huge that
no attempt to artificially restrict the number
of employees in a particular industry would
succeed for a moment.

“Canadian Reciprocity, or Fooled
Again”: A Drama in One Act.
The passionate and unaccountable craving
to fix up a reciprocity treaty and promote
commerce with Canada —as inexplicable in
its way as Prime Minister Clumsy Mac-
donald’s craving to arrange a brotherly
agreement between Britain and Russia —took
definite shape the other day, when the Min-
ister for Trade and Customs laid the draft
bargain before Parliament, and invited it to
let its pent-up enthusiasm have vent. Canada
is one of the two countries, the other being
the United States, with which Australia’s
commercial relations are so one-sided as to
be a bad joke, and almost attain to the dig-
nity of a nuisance and an insult. In 1922.
which is as far as the Federal “Official Year
Rook” has got, the Dominion ranked sixth
for. value among 27 enumerated customers
which sold goods to us; it ranked 23rd for
value among 30 enumerated customers which
bought goods from us. This was a five-
years’ record:—
Bought from Canada. Sold to Canada.
1917- . . £1,667,068 £785,130
1918- .. 2,884,050 891,529

1920- .. 4,425,262 154,899
1921- .. 3,146,450 373,570
A customer of that sort appears about the
last one that is worth troubling about, un-
less the trouble takes the form of an attempt
to close the account, and transfer the buy-
ing business where it will meet with a better
response. Yet the craving to sign up with
the Canuck amounts to a mania. The trend
of the draft agreement is that Canada is an
advanced and progressive manufacturing
country with finished wares to dispose of,
and that Australia is an aboriginal sort of
place with raw materials to throw on the
market. The items are not all based on
that theory, but it represents the prevailing
spirit. According to Minister Pratten’s ex-
position, Canada is to receive from Australia
a concession on 12 articles, while it grants
this country a concession on 14. Nothing
could well be more gratifying than that. So
far as the daily-paper report can be relied
upon these are the 12 lines on which Aus-
tralia is to make concessions:—
Type-composing machines, printing machines, type-
writers, electrotyping machinery, stereotyping
machinery, adding and computing' machines, news-
print paper, and printing paper, n.e.i., of Canadian
make, to come in here free.
Fish, gloves, corsets, -writing and typewriting paper,
tubes (iron, wood and steel) for pipes, boots and
shoes, goloshes, rubber sandshoes, and vehicle parts,
whether assembled or loose, to come in at reduced
rates.
It may read like a rather crowded dozen,
but a great many can go into a dozen when
an expert packer gets on the job. These
are all items which Canada already sells to
Australia, many of them on a large scale, and
under improved conditions it hopes to sell
more. In return Australia is to get reduced
duties on a fairly long list of articles, but
the reductions don r t amount to much in the
majority of cases and the additions to the
free list are not many. They consist chiefly
of wine, of which the Canuck has never used
much, and beeswax —though this item isn’t
quite clear; and no nation can live on bees-
wax. By way, possibly, of a fancy jest the
terms of the proposed bargain include re-
duced imposts on meat, lard, tallow, cheese,
butter, eggs and apples. The Dominion has
a surplus of all these things for export;
the last available year’s record showed that
it sent, inside 12 months, £4,494,000 worth
of eggs and £2,016,000 worth of raw apples
to Britain alone. Then a concession of a
mild sort is proffered on “onions in natural
state.” But Australia isn’t very strong on
natural onions; in 1921 N. S. Wales was
actually importing them from the United
States. The duty on honey, trade in which
is doubtful, is diminished in one direction
and apparently raised in another, and the
duty on brandy is cut from 10 dollars per
gallon to 9. At 10 dollars Canada, so far as
can be traced, took 98 gallons of the stuff in
ANYTHING FOR PEACE.
“Members of the Ramsay Macdonald Government warn the public that if the British loan is not
granted to Russia, an alliance between the Bolshevik Government and Germany is inevitable.”
Peacemaker Macdonald (to Britannia) : "Oh, give him the money, Madame. If you
don’t he’ll go off and take up with that German woman.”
the last recorded year, and it will probably
do much the same at 9 dollars. There are
other points, but the continuous tendency
is that the Canuck receives a solid advantage
on a number of expensive articles for which
there is an assured market here, and gives'
a grudging benefit on a number of items,
mostly rather cheap ones, for which there is
a very poor pretence of a market on his side.
If the very expensive brother across the
Pacific offered to put Australian coal and
sugar on his free list and admit Australian
brandy at half-rates, some aspect of fairness
would attach to the business. In its present
form, the draft treaty should be rejected
unanimously, with a trace of anger that our
sagacity should be rated so low. The Bruce-
Page. Ministry doubtless made the best bar-
gain it could, and regards the result as Hob-
son’s choice. But why should it be bound
to make any bargain at all? And why
should it not drown Hobson?
Pratten Moves.
. „ , , ,
Pratten, Minister of Customs, had the
House of Representatives with him when he
announced that it was the Government’s in-
tention to put a sanitary cordon round the
continent so as to protect the x\ustralian
child against the plague of low-class Amen-
can moving pictures and advertisements,
There have been howls of rage from lm-
porters who have battened on the noxious
business, and one of their mouthpieces
has tried to make a sectarian matter of it
because Archbishop Duiiig—together with
Anglican divines, educational authorities,
Labor Ministers and returned-soldier confer-
ences, State and Commonwealth —recently
protested against the Australian cinema-
theatre being made a vehicle for the propa-
gation of the putrid ideas and manners of
American morons. But the Minister may
rest assured that people of all parties and
creeds will support any honest attempt to
morally disinfect the picture-show and Aus-
tralianise it. He proposes :
(!) To tighten up the censorship on films dealing
with murder, highway robbery, burglary, miscegena
ticn, rape, adultery, and other favorite Hollywood
themes. In this connection the Chief Censor
reports that many American films hold marriage up
to ridicule, and mock at the power of the law.
(2) To keep a more vigilant eye on filthy imported
posters and other abominable advertising matter.
Hitherto this stuff has contained brazen allusions to
features which have been struck out or toned down
by the Censor. In future, a film advertised as in-
decent or otherwise degenerate will be judged by
the advertiser’s standard, and dealt with accordingly,
even if it has been passed for exhibition; and an
importer so offending will be deprived of the privilege
now granted to his tribe of reconstructing pictures
which are offensive in parts and submitting them
again.
(3) To treat as a prohibited import “any film
objectionable to the sentiments of the people of the
British Empire.” Kelly Gang and Gun Alley
pictures will likewise go on the list of prohibited
exports.
(4) To give “some measure of encouragement—
even if only indirectly—to the production of suit-
able films in Australia.”
Some of the reforms are to be ushered in
immediately by regulation, but the last pro-
posal will require special legislation or a
tariff amendment. Australia is one of the
world’s best markets for the movies; if it
wasn’t American agents wouldn’t swarm
here as they do. An extension of the pro-
tective principle to picture-production would
enable Australians with a talent that way
to get a footing in their own market. A
useful industry would thus be established,
and—what is more important—the cinema
theatre would become a factor in the develop-
ment of the Australian spirit instead of
being given over to the glorification of bla-
tant and decadent features of American life.

“Vereco” on the Jutland battle:—
“X.N.0.” (B. 25/9/' , 24) qualifies his statement
that the German Fleet never moved after Jutland.
Certainly it moved considerably, but as he thinks that
its movements after that were of no importance, I
acknowledge his right to his own opinion. My
contention is that the capture of Riga and the inva-
sion of Finland were events of grave importance; and
it in no wise detracts from the activities of the Ger-
man fleet to say that it was safe in the Baltic. It
was none too safe, as the torpedoing of dreadnoughts
proved. Had Jutland been a crushing naval victory for
Britain there would have been no German campaign
in the Baltic, though there might have been a British
one. As for the historic result of Jutland, it was
undoubtedly negative, and, as a brilliant victory for
the side which lost, it sealed the doom of Russia and
sent the Holy Czar, Rasputin and Co. on the Sunset
Trail. Had Jellicoe secured the command of the
Baltic, and broken the German blockade within a
blockade, there would have been no famine in Petro-
grad, no revolution, and no uplift of Brothers
Trotsky, Lenin, Radek, et al. In the end even
tha British submarines were driven from the Baltic,
and red chaos- reigned where once an ally stood.
When chaos simmers down a little more in Europe
we will be better able to appraise events at their
true value; but taking Jutland as the only real naval
battle of the war, its significance undoubtedly lies
in what both sides failed to accomplish, and not in
what either did accomplish. Hence the argument.

“Geo. Rich” : The Westralian Education
Department is experimentally merging a
number of small country schools into a
central one. Lately at Mount Barker five
small mills, serving a large area, were
merged in a central institution; and though
the children are conveyed in and out daily by
motor-lorries, it is computed that £250 will
be saved annually. The educational facilities
at the central establishment make it a sort of
high school —or (vide Director of Education
Andrew's), “a school of specialised instruc-
tion.” Toodyay instituted the system in
W.A. two years ago; the children there are
brought in from a 20-mile circuit. They are
provided with a two-course hot mid-day meal,
prepared on the school premises, at sixpence
per head, most of the vegetables on the menu
being grown by the children in the school
garden. Both Toodyay and Mt. Barker
schools have active Parents and Citizens’
Associations attached to them, and these have
accomplished much fine work in the improve-
ment of school grounds and equipment.

R. A. Crouch, Liberal M.H.R. for Corio
(Vic.) from 1901 till 1909 and a Labor can-
didate on several occasions since, turned up
in Ireland recently with “letters of intro-
duction to the leaders of the Labor, Free
State and Republican parties.” Having thus
learned all about it (the views of the pro-
British parties, iu Ulster and South Ireland
being immaterial), he returned to London
with the information that “the Treaty was
obtained by duress and fraud,” Lloyd George
having “threatened, they say, that if it was
not signed he would turn Ireland into a
desert.” Which “unscrupulous opportun-
ism,” real or imaginary, the gentleman con-
demns. Again :
The Treaty insists on an objectionable oath of
allegiance which the great bulk of the Irish dele-
gates desire not to take, Ireland having regained
its right to its own form of government hy conquest.
Undoubtedly the position in Ireland in 1919 was
Irish victory over its own land De Valera has
offered a permanent alliance with the States of the
British Commonwealth. What purpose then is served
in retaining a monarchical fiction? Far better to
take what is definitely offered, a permanent alliance,
from which time friendly and closer relations will
succeed.
Crouch is a member of the A.L.P.’s Federal
executive, and was a delegate from that body
to a Labor conference in London. His
account of the situation, such as it is, was
published in the British Australasian,
which states that he was “asked to
make a special trip to Ireland, so
as to get first-hand knowledge of the
real conditions” ; but as an old politician and
an Australian he ought to have known better
than rush it into print at a crisis so delicate
that all the British parties tacitly agreed
not to discuss it. By so doing he rendered
no service to Australia, Britain or Ireland.
During the last year or two the Irish ques-
tion has been kept out of Australian politics,
with great advantage to the people, and inci-
dentally with profit to the Labor party. But
it will assuredly return to plague the nation
if representative Australians follow Crouch's
bad example, instead of deciding, as they
should, that it would be a kindness to drop
the subject and hope for the best.

POLITICAL
POINTS
What Labor-leader Charlton saw at
Colombo, so he tells a colleague, strengthened
his determination to “keep Australia white.”
Then he went on to Europe and announced
that one of the first things the Australian
Labor party would do if it got into power
again was to destroy what poor little
military defence-system Australia owns.
Presumably Charlton thinks he can keep Aus-
tralia white with his mouth. But what sort
of a reception would he get if lie went back to
Newcastle and advised the miner to dissolve
his unions, and trust to the. same hole in his
face to keep the mines “white”?
The N.S.W. Fuller Government has
knocked threepence off the income-tax on
individuals, and abolished the stamp duties
on mortgages and receipts for wages and
salaries and a few other documents, and re-
duced others. Thereby the Treasurer expects
to have £450,000 less revenue to play with.
As the public debt increased by £26,922,000
(to £210,493.000) last year, the interest bill
will go up £828.000 this year, and the accu-
mulated deficit amounts to £2,674,000, the
good Cocks cannot really afford to sacrifice
a penny of revenue; but his Government is
going to the country shortly, and the elec-
tors have to be kidded somehow. No income-
tax concession is proposed for companies,
although the tax on company profits is 2s. Gd.
in the £ in N. S. Wales as against Is. in Vic-
toria ; moreover, there are companies more,
deserving of consideration than big book-
makers, pony-racecourse proprietors and slum
landlords, who will get the threepenny reduc-
tion. The company vote happens to be
negligible.
No character out of Dickens —not even
Uncle Pumblechook—could have done much
better than Minister Pearce did when ex-
plaining the N. Territory posttion :
The Administrator had frequently asked for a
motor-launch to enable him to carry out his duties
better and travel from place to place as occasion
required. Owing to lack of funds the request had , in
the past, been refused, but had now been granted.
The man who kaiserwilliams the N.T. is lord
of 1040 miles of coastline, and in that almost
roadless region the sea is the best means of
travel. It is an almost shiplcss sea, and as
the Administrator can’t swim from port to
port by reason of sharks, a launch seems
reasonable. But the Parliamentary crowd
which could afford to raise its salary twice
and thinks of doing it again, which amused
its foolish self by owning a few dozen ships
and laying them up because they didn’t pay,
and which is joyously blewing £65,000,000
revenue per annum, says it couldn’t let its
viceroy have oi’dinary means of locomotion
for want of money !
This year, it is reckoned, Australia will
grow enough sugar for its own needs; also
it 1 will have 90,000 tons for export —a thing
that never happened before —and no place to
send it to. That is to say, it can be sold in
any foreign country provided it is sold at
nigger prices, which is a dispiriting process.
Probably to avoid being dispirited the in-
dustry will ask for a Federal export bonus,
and Australians will get dear sugar them-
selves that people in England may get cheap
sugar. It is a mad business: what Aus-
tralia really needs is the sense to import less
clothes and boots and machinery, and have
more people in Australian factories to eat
sugar.
The attempt to arrange an Aiiglo-Hun
commercial treaty is said to be off “owing
to the German refusal to make concessions
respecting the taxation of British goods ex-
ported to Germany, which will be subjected
to practically prohibitive duties under the
German tariff now in preparation.” France
got trade concessions from the Hun because
it was ready, if necessary, to be as prohibi-
tive as he could be, or worse. But Christian
Macdonald says his Freetrade creed forbids
him to hit back, so he gets it (with interest)
on the other cheek also.
The sketch-plan of the British Ministry’s
Housing Bill has been published. It goes
on the plain principle that the tvay to do a
thing is to dash well do it. Municipal coun-
cils, trustees and companies are to be
authorised to build houses, and let them at
1914 rents. To make the rents possible mer-
chants are to supply building materials at
1914 prices, under penalty of having their
stocks seized. The Ministry reckons that
if the Opposition will only throw out this
great measure it will go to the country on
it, and sweep the electorates, and come back
good for five years. But perhaps the Oppo-
sition won’t throw it out. It may be better
fun to let it pass and watch results.
FAIR PLAY IS BONNY PLAY.
“In explaining the provisions of the Gas Bill now before the Vic. House, Chief Secretary Tunnecliffe
said that any company improperly increasing its profits by supplying gas not up to standard would have
to compensate consumers.”
Victoria (to Tunncoliffe): “Bonser! But what about applying it to your own gas
works?”
As in the case of dried fruits, a control
board and a London agency are to be set
up “to market our surplus dairy produc-
tion,” and 80 p.c. of the value of the butter,
raisins, currants, etc., exported will be ad-
vanced bv the Government. Quoting figures
supplied by one of the largest co-operative
dairy cos. in Queensland, Forde, M.H.R. for
Capricornia, showed in the House of Reps,
recently that the average number of sup-
pliers dropped from 2807 in 1921 to 2283
in 1923, and the average weekly cheque—
the farmer’s gross return —diminished from
£4 10s. to £2 10s. J. D. Connolly, sometime
Westralian Minister and Agent-General, re-
turning after an absence of 30 years to his
native Darling Downs, was staggered to find
that there had been “a decrease in popula-
tion, and, in most districts, in production.
And' the Downs are one of the most fertile
parts of the continent. Yet there are im-
beciles who contend that Australia would be
bloated with riches if it concentrated on
“primary production for the oversea mar-
kets,” and bought foreign manufactures out
of the invisible profits, leaving the home
market to be blighted by Freetrade.
With wheat in the neighborhood of 6s.
at any Australian port of shipment, the
N. S. Wales Government didn’t take much
risk in “guaranteeing” 3s. 4d. at sidings, plus
eiglitpence freight. Ministers would have
done the N.S.W. cocky a far greater service
if they had taken steps to save part of
the appalling amount he has to spend
on cornsacks: the cost of these things now
runs to very nearly fivepence per bushel.
The silos are a small help, certainly; but
an enormous number of bags still have to be
bought, and will probably always have to
be bought. Fourteenpence for a cornsack
is an imposition from which Cocky ought to
be protected; and it’s a job for the Agricul-
tural Departments to tackle.
Vestey. of the Darwin meatworks (stopped
since 1920), states that an effort will be
made to resume in a small way next year
provided the Federal Department in charge
will show some flicker of animation. The
charge is made that in all the years of its
control in the Territory the Commonwealth
has built no new telegraphs, supplied no per-
manent roads or bridges, established no wire-
less, and done nothing to the wharf save let
it slide. But for the annual white-ant races
there would be really nothing doing.
The Commonwealth recognised Tatter-
sail’s gamble by collecting reyenue from it,
and now it recognises it again by present-
ing the Tasmanian Government with the
revenue. All the same, Tatt.’s was, and re-
mains, an illegal and accursed thing, which
is banned by the Federal post-office under
the regulation which forbids the transmission
of venomous serpents through the mail. In
a somewhat similar fashion Papua and New
Guinea are outside the Commonwealth for
tariff purposes, and inside it for Navigation
Act purposes. And in the same way the
Government acquired about three dozen ships
that it had no demand for. while the Ad-
ministrator of the Northern Territory was re-
fused a paltry launch to get about in be-
cause the Federal Treasury was allegedly
broke to the wide world.
China’s threat to withdraw from the
League of Nations unless she is given a seat
on the Council, Japan’s refusal to sign the
disarmament protocol unless the League
agrees to poke its finger into any domestic
pie. and Russia’s pressure put on Germany
to keep her from joining—these things indi-
cate that personal feeling sways Foreign
Offices as it does individuals. Perhaps P'ique
of Nations would be a better name for it at
the moment.
Adelaide Labor Council lately passed the
customary resolution that immigration
should in no way be encouraged “until all
the unemployed have been found work.”
Unluckily it is estimated that 98 per cent.
of the unemployed are unskilled drudges,
and if it is held that Australia must not
import, say, a batch of carpet weavers until
all of these 98 per centers have been fur-
nished with congenial occupation, the pros-
pects of a carpet industry are small. It is
like a man who wants a concrete floor decid-
ing that no cement shall be bought till all
the water and gravel have been used up.
The stereotyped cablegram (29/9/’24) :
Mr. Ramsay Macdonald dwelt chiefly on the Russian
treaty. He declared that we are not giving a loan
to Russia. We are only guaranteeing a loan. Jt
would be largely spent on the purchase of goods and
materials in Britain. It would be impossible to
bring peace to Europe if Russia was left out.
Britain gave full recognition to the Soviet
Government at the end of last January, and
helped it to get the recognition of most of
the other Powers, and trades freely with
Russia, and sends the usual diplomatic re-
presentatives there, so it is difficult to see
flow the position of the big bully differs
from that of France or Italy, except that
they haven’t repudiated their debts, don’t
spend their creditors’ money in financing
conspiracies abroad, and aren’t massacring
any small white Christian race. Apparently
those are the engaging qualities that entitle
Russia to specially favorable treatment.
When you start rings and corners it is
just as well to prepare for the swing-back—
there is generally one coming. There was
a Tasmanian hop pool in 1921, and seeing
its chance it ran the price of Tasmanian
hops up to Bs. and even 10s. per lb. Most
Australian brewers had been using the
locally-grown article for years, but when
prices soared and they could buy imported
at from 2s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. they went abroad
for their requirements. This led the Pool
to ask the Federal Government to place an
embargo on imported hops, and at a confer-
ence of growers,, brewers and the Govern-
ment an arrangement was arrived at to
allow the importation of only 15 p.c. of
foreign hops. This arrangement, the grow-
ers allege, has not been faithfully observed
by the other two parties to the contract.
Anyway, the Tasmanian growers now have
on hand, over and above Australian require-
ments, from 3000 to 4000 bales of 2241 b. each
which, if not used, will quickly deteriorate.
The market in Britain shows a shortage of
80.000 bales, but the nearness of Continental
markets and the rate of foreign exchange
give the Tasmanians a poor chance in that
quarter.
The Queensland Government’s Golden
Casket lottery got a glowing advt. in the
Brisbane Police Court last week when two
clerks were charged with having obtained
ten prizes (two of £lOO, one of £5O, two of
£4O and others for smaller amounts) by
monkeying with the tickets. Both accused
pleaded guilty. One was given four months
hard; the other, who had been up before,
will serve six months, with the usual remis-
sions. What sort of control is exercised
when a man with a conviction against him
is employed on such a job?
Lemmon, Minister of Labor in the Prender-
gast Cabinet, paid a visit to the Melbourne
Trades Hall the other day to receive instruc-
tions from his bosses, the union officials.
They put a long list of requests before him.
They wanted Wages-Board determinations to
be made State-wide, with no discrimination
between city and country. Lemmon agreed.
They wanted the right to make use both of
Wages Board and of Arbitration Court, in-
stead of having to choose between them, as
at present. Lemmon agreed. Then they
asked that State public servants should be
allowed to appeal to the Arbitration Court
for what they could not get from the Classifi-
cation Board. Lemmon agreed. They
wanted more Wages Boards —many more of
them. Lemmon agreed. Then a gentleman
asked that union secretaries should be ap-
pointed chairmen of Wages Boards. But
this was too much even for Lemmon to swal-
low ; he laughed and executed a strategic
retirement to a previously prepared dugout.
When Prendergast was Vic. Opposition
leader he was never as obliging as lie found
Peacock the other night. He wanted to
whisk through a little bill to enable the
Tram Board to complete a loan transaction
in London. There was only one rough copy
of the measure available, but, following the
lead of the complaisant Peacock, the House
took Prendergast’s word for it, and let the
Speaker and Chairman of Committees rattle
the thing to the other House. Presumably
Cameron or Strangward. of the Tram Board,
had assured “the heads” that everything was
O.K.
“Harold Hardupp”: The sign “Good Ac-
commodation for Country Visitors,” to be
seen on so many Melbourne hotels, is liable
to set the visitor from Sydney thinking of
the number of Harbor City Bungs who care
about nothing but their bar trade. The
activities of the Vic. Licenses Reduction
Board explain the difference. When that
body is reviewing licenses the pub which
does its full duty by the public receives most
consideration. The mere bar-pub is the
first to be passed out —in fact, most of them
have long since been passed out. No other
State ever got quite so practical a measure
of pub and licensing reform as Victoria.
HIS CUP OF BITTERNESS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“We, the fighters of yesterday, the policemen of
politics, are now sitting at the feet of the Nationalists,
striking the chords of harmony on the harps that
have been given us in place of our swords, and sing-
ing ‘Love Me and the World is Mine.’ And all who
refuse to join in this chorus are regarded as rebels. ’
— lUx-Minister Stewart on the Federal pact.
Time was we streamed exultant to the fight,
Despising compromise, disdaining truce;
In smashing verbal stoush was our delight,
We went for Billy Hughes and cooked his goose.
And have we come to such a parlous plight
That we must feed out of the hand of Bruce?
Tigers that were, must we be purring cats
To smoodge around a city magnate’s spats?
Yelling defiance to the universe
We marched of yore beneath the Cocky flag;
All other creeds we spoke of with a curse,
And every rival standard was a rag.
We vowed to stand alone for better or worse—
Brothers, d’you realise we’re in the bag?
Nobbled and hobbled ? Roped and thrown, I say,
To make a Nationalist holiday!
We deemed ourselves the cops of politics
Whose mission (till we came to rule the roast)
Would be prevention of those knavish tricks
Dear to the Liberal and Labor host—
The ramps they engineer, they jobs they fix —
Whichever happens to be uppermost.
If we’re policemen still, ’tis squared police—
Corrupted guardians of the slothful peace.
My voice that once in Cocky’s service rang
And specified his needs with force and fire,
Sounds out of place in this harmonious gang,
This massed and mutuql admiration choir.
I'd rather have a blackthorn I could bang
Crowns with, impartially, than harp or lyre
To charm the ears with. To be more exact,
I'm full of it. The Devil take the Pact!

“Marko”: Dr. Robert Hutchinson has pro-
pounded a theory to the B.M.A. that eldest
clsfldren are more frequently handicapped by
ill-health of some sort than their younger
brothers and sisters. I evolved this theory
from personal observation about 15 years
ago. My father’s eldest brother is distinctly
erratic; my own eldest brother was weak,
and eventually died of consumption, assisted
by drink; and when my father married a
second time, and my eldest step-brother
was mentally deficient, and when also my
uncle’s eldest daughter was delicate and died
young, I concluded there was a hoodoo on
eldest children —at any rate, in our family. I
asked questions, and discovered that in each
case the eldest son or daughter had been
born just about nine months after the
parents’ marriage. That seemed to provide
the clue. My own eldest daughter is per-
fectly healthy and normal, but I took good

care, with the family examples before me,
that she was not born till over two years
after my wife and I were married. At the
time of marriage both husband and wife are
naturally in an abnormal condition, more
particularly, perhaps, the wife; and it seems
to me only right to wait until the excitement
has died down. If the father and mother
are phlegmatic and unemotional creatures
no harm would probably result. Otherwise
it seems to me newly-weds would best serve
the future of mankind if they avoided rush-
ing things. I have frequently propounded
my theory to others, and have invariably
found my hearers able to give examples in
confirmation.
“Igua”: The Governor-General indirectly
contributed to the amusement of Moresby s
ordinary citizens. Like every single-cylinder
town, the island capital has several layers
in its social crust. Mrs. Orpington, whose
meal-ticket rakes in a salary of six hundred,
really cannot meet on the same social plane
the wife of Mr. Langslian, whose income is
in the four or five hundred class, and so on
down the scale. Thus it was, when the
Mataram floated into the tiny, sun-baked
island metropolis, the welcome from the long-
haired sex to the G.-G. and his lady lacked
that whole-hearted hospitality Papua is
famed for. All the available silver teapots
in the town were pressed into the service.
The owners of common delf, earthenware,
china, enamel and tin utensils weren’t asked
to attend ; owners of billycans were not even
considered. One or two even of the silver tea-

STELLA: “Certainly, dearest. I’ll order some plainer frocks to-morrow.”
pots were invited without the owners. One of
these latter is a mistress with a strong
mind. Invitation or no invitation, she accom-
panied her property—-and sat close to the
Presence. It was all very paltry ; but the
fact that matters is that his Ex. didn’t have
a chance to meet many of the oldest resi-
dents—sturdy Aussies, who helped to found
what will be the seventh State of the Com-
monwealth.

“T.P.”: I always worship at our little
Methodist tabernacle when Brawther Tredin-
nick is in the pulpit. East Sunday he gave
it to us hot and strong on the text that
the unregenerated would be shovelled into
“gross darkness.” “Now, wliat do ‘grawss’

Trcdennick looked ’e up in the dictionary,

“Herodot”: Eight years ago in Adelaide a
soldier married a young woman on the eve
of his embarkation for France. _ Twelve
months later he was reported “missing,” and
some time after that a Board of Inquiry duly
found that he had been killed in action.
Officially dead he remained until a couple
ot months ago, when his widow, who had
since moved to Sydney, applied for a, job as
housekeeper of a pub in a N.S.W. Western
town, and obtained it. The first person
whom she encountered on arrival was
her long-dead husband, who was em-
ployed there as handyman. For a time he
desperately denied his identity, but finally
gave in and admitted it, telling a jumbled
story of desertion in France, a thrilling trip
to the border of a neutral country, and six
years’ wanderings over the earth, until he
eventually reached Australia again The
long-separated couple are re-united and living
happily together.
* * * *
“Nakhoda”: The failure of the recent
attempts to get in touch with our planetary
neighbor Mars is a matter for congratula-
tion, whichever way you care to look at it,
and any further endeavors to communicate
with the star of the sinister hue or to get
there by projectile or any other means should
be made a punishable offence. We have
enough troubles of our own. It is almost
inconceivable that the Martians should be
stupider than we, but if they are it would
be only adding so many more poods or
catties to the White Man’s burden, which,
what with a billion backward colored people
and increasing multitudes of cretins, morons,
syphilitics and congenital criminals of our
own blood, is about as much as we can
stagger under at present. If the problemati-
cal canal-builders are a superior race, their
higher morality will have caused them to
discard the low instinct of destruction, and
they would fall an easy prey to terrestrial
adventurers, who would rob or wipe them
out as the Spaniards did the civilisations of
Mexico and Peru. In any case they are
bound to be fundamentally different from us.
Their women may be blessed with 10 breasts,
like the Ephesian Diana; they may have
more than the usual ration of legs, like a
milliped; or heads arranged on a universal
joint, like the tarsius. They may have
eliminated the stomach, like the Fletcherites
nearly succeeded in doing, and they may con-
verse' telepathically instead of by means of
speech, in which case they would be able to
read our inmost and spitefullest thoughts
before they were uttered. The instinct to
evade consideration of our own problems by
exciting ourselves over the condition of
other people is human : in the Middle Ages
it took the form of forgetting the cesspool
you were standing in by concentrating atten-
tion on Heaven ; but the red planet has come
and gone without showing any signs of wish-
ing to know us better, and we would be "well
advised to respect its obvious desire for soli-
tude and leave it alone.

“Rita”: The term “butcher,” used to de-
note a certain measure of beer, is of Adel-
aide origin, as “Topee” (B. 18/9/’24) opines;
but probably few know the genesis of it.
In the early days, when Conrad —for many
years Adelaide’s biggest butcher —had his
headquarters in Hindley-street, his employees
provided the main source of revenue for the
bar of the Victoria Hotel, a few doors away.
At that time the only measures in vogue were
pints and small ’tins —priced 4d. and 2d. re-
spectively. For some reason the butchers
came to regard the one as too large and the
other as too small, and prevailed on Bung
to introduce a glass midway between the pint
and the small ’un at the popular price of 3d.
* * * *
Mrs. Lance Rawson’s conclusion: —
To anyone with an intimate knowledge of the
aborigines the story of white women being held
captive by any tribe, though possible, is not pro-
bable. A more feasible explanation of the present
affair is that it began by the resuscitation of some
old story. Several of these were brought to me m
the old days. Forty years ago a white woman and
child were reported to be living among the Wide
Bay and Burnett (Q.) blacks. Investigation showed
that there was no truth in the story, but it also
showed that 15 or 20 years previously a woman and
child had been lost during a flood and found by
the blacks in this district. Again, in the early
’sixties, two young white girls actually did live for
a time among the Fraser Island (Q.) blacks, and
I believe they were rescued by the police; but that
same story was repeated in ’79 and ’BO as if it had
just happened. Judging by my own experience and
knowledge of Fraser Island and Wide Bay natives
of 40 years ago, if white women were ever held
captives by the blacks the gins would not have
tolerated them for more than a day, and the men
would have killed them for peace sake in the camp.

“Sixenate” ; A Mrs. Malaprop with a wider
range than common came to light in a Mel-
bourne police court recently. She had been
called to give evidence on behalf of a nephew,
one of whose previous lapses was men-
tioned almost as soon as she entered the box.
“Pardon me,” she said loftily. “In the first
instinct he was let off that: his sentence was
expended for his previous good behavior,
and he was placed in bond. I am one or
the boundaries. All he got was an admira-
tion from the Judge,” When the Bench had
recovered its gravity it decided to give tbe
bonded one another chance.

“Gallery Slave”: A reminder that the
man who intended to throw a stone at the
Government lived in a glass-house
the hurried withdrawal of a question of
which notice had been given in an Austra-
lian Parliament. In terms of patriotic in-
dignation the reformer demanded to know the
facts about Government extravagance m the
motor-car department and the use of State
joy-waggons for unauthorised excursions. But
a Ministerial supporter well primed with in-
formation had a word with him on the sub-
ject, and the notice was withdrawn. Ihe
patriot is now wondering whether it was
the lady or the chauffeur who told.

“The Deacon” : Touching the last requests
of criminals about to pay the extreme penalty
(B. 25/9/’24), Martha Rendall, the child-
poisoner, and the last woman executed in
W.A., was at least truly feminine. She re-
quested, before she was pinioned in her cell,
that somebody would carefully fasten down
the bottom of her skirts, lest they should fly
up on her descent through the trap-dor.
* * * *
“Law Table” : A new method of sly-grog
selling was discussed at the Orange (N.S.W.)
Police Court the other day, when the police
alleged that the two sons of a hotelkeeper m
the district were in the habit of attending
local dances and entertainments in a motor-
lorry well stocked with assorted booze. I ull-
ing up their wheeled groggery outside the
hall or building where an entertainment was
in progress, they would proceed to retail nips
at Is. (id. a time. Evidence was given by
three constables, who watched a brisk trade
being done at a church function where no-
thing stronger than tea was on sale officially.
The defence was that most of the entertain-
ments in question were attended largely by
customers of the paternal hotel, and that the
lorry was in attendance, out of Bung s pure
goodness of heart, to provide free stimulants
for patrons who might get tired of soft
tack. What between the impudence of the
offence and the chilled-steel cheek of the
“explanation,” the £3O fines inflicted seem
lamentably inadequate.
* * * *
“Church Street” : The news that Spiffkins
was a likely candidate for the next election
made quite a stir in our sedate suburb. It
also made Johnson remarkably angry, and
he unloaded some of his fury on his meek
little neighbor, Jenkins. “Why,” he exploded,
“the man’s a scoundrel. I mean it! ±en
years ago, when we were partners, he robbed
me ” And Johnson gave a lot of convincing,
if fiery, detail of that and other Spiffkins
misdemeanors, including several choice bits
of roguery and countless perjuries. It
seemed that there was little short of murder
that Spiffkins could not be charged with.
Jenkins clucked in a horrified way, and sain :
“Terrible! Terrible!” in his mild, little
voice. Some days later Johnson arrived in
time to hear the end of an argument at the
FROM THE WRECK.
“They say she toasted every penny of his
money.”
“Not at all. The last of it paid for the
divorce .”
Bowling Club, and, when he’d recovered from
his amazement, fell upon little Jenkins tooth
and nail. “Good gosh!” he raged. Here
I've proved to you that Spiffkins is a rogue
and a thief and a liar. And when they ask
you what you’ve got against him you”
“Oh, ves,” broke in Jenkins placatively, I
said I had nothing against him. But I
meant, of course, as a politician.”

A PLEA FOR TACT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ ‘lt’s a pity a man can’t have a quarrel with his
family without everyone interfering with him,’ said
John Wells Ferguson, when fined 40s. at the South
Melbourne Court for having used improper words
near a public place.”
If a man uses language improper
To his wife in a full, crowded street,
Or with a big batten should whop her,
Or angrily raise her and flop her
With a sickening thud
In a puddle of mud —-
Why, that is absolutely his business, and it would be
a lamentable pity if any outsider, poking his
nose into another person’s affairs,
Should resent his behavior with heat.
For a man may, perchance, have his failing,
But he’s only got one life to live,
And if exercise brisk with a railing
May suit a mood in him prevailing,
Relieving his heart
As he wallops his tart,
It’s a thousand pities if anyone, moved by crudely
chivalrous feelings, should take steps to deprive
him of
The rapture this pleasure may give.
Of course there are men who don’t like to
Stand by while a woman is whacked ;
AVhom a wife-beating act gives the spike to;
Yet, if there is no place to bike to
Well out of the way—
Or no bike —let them say:
“The home is the proper place for that; you’ll enjoy
it much better” ; or, “Hey, old man, you’re
blocking the traffic” ;
Or in some other way display tact.

“Henry Pannikin” : Apropos record casual-
ties from a single shell (B. 18/9/’24). When
the 4th Brigade was camped at Allonville
after the Huns had started their smash to-
vvards the coast, the 13tli had no sooner re-
tired to their huts than a shell lobbed on a
billet and exploded right in the centre of it.
Men from the other units were soon rushing
to help the stricken, and then another little
present from Jerry arrived. Those must
have been two of the most catastrophic shots
of the war—the casualties, killed and
wounded, were 88.

“Tan": The Governor-General was visit-
ing a native village near Rabaul. Alongside
him tramped the dapper District-Officer, his
eagle eyes searching everywhere for a twig
or a blade of grass that had been allowed
to grow or blow out of its prescribed place.
For this was the show village of the district,
and the D.O. and his police had spent many
strenuous days attending to the little hamlet
so that it would be worthy of a “surprise”
visit from Exalted Authority. Said the D.O.
to the Cocked Hat casually: “A very happy
idea of yours, sir, to drop in on these folk.
Coming like this, so unexpected, you will see
these people living their natural life.” The
G.-G. made the necessary response, and was
piloted into the shade of the biggest house
in the hamlet. A small bronze child dashed
up to offer a fizzing cocoanut drink—one of
the “spontaneous” incidents that the sweat-
ing D.O. had rehearsed so carefully the day
before. Cameras having clicked, the G.-G.
climbed up a ladder and explored the one-
roomed dwelling. It was clean and very pre-
sentable. The D.O. swelled with pride.
The G.-G. climbed back to the ground; the
D.O. followed. Then a voice spoke from the
shadow of a cocoanut bole and spoiled every-
thing : “Iviap, can we keep-em bloom V
sclub-blush alonga Sunday? Two day we-
fellow work plenty get-em village ready be-
longa Big Fellow Master he come look see
all-a boy!”

“Matupi”: In case there’s a Strange-
Ways-of-Meeting-a-Wife competition, I enter
this. Arriving at a native village in the
Witu district of ex-German New Guinea 32
years ago, a white man found there one
living inhabitant. Small-pox had accounted
for the rest. At its dead mother’s breast

“Sixenate": Fate gave a sardonic laugh
when a Melbourne thief of infinte careful-
ness was laid, literally, by the heels. He
had worn gloves and left no finger-prints on
a neat shopbreaking job; but he was un-
aware that there was some soft, newly-laid
cement in the premises he was robbing. And
it so happened that the depredator had rub-
ber heels, peculiarly worn, on his boots,
which left an impression on the cement far
more easily identifiable than any thumb-
marks. It took only a few days to gather
him in ; and if it had been a hanging matter
the hardened cement-prints would have sup-
plied all the evidence necessary.

“Ack”: Narrow war-escapes arrived
oftener than fresh beef. Our party was pre-
paring breakfast on
a terrace in the
Judean Hills when
a shell from a
mountain - gun
knocked the fire
several ways and
ruined the tucker.
But the shell was
a dud, and nothing
worse than a
shower of charred
sticks and hot
water befel the in-
dignant cooks. In
October, 1915, on
Gallipoli, the
Turks introduced
th e “broomstick”
bomb, an affair
weighing a bout
151 b. Attached to
a “broomstick,”
and fired from some
antique gun at a
high angle, i t
would fall almost
as though dropped
from an aeroplane.
These fearsome
missiles were fitted
with percussion-
caps, and burst on
striking the ground,
spreading destruc-
tion over a wide
area. My pal was
awakened one night
by a sharp blow on
the side of the
temple, and found
one of these pro-
jectiles sticking in
the ground in the
floor of his dugout.
It had just taken
some skin off his
forehead—and failed to explode !

“Lee Q.”: If the manager of Pentridge
has liis way you will have no difficulty in
finding your destination when you come to
Melbourne. Having just established something
like a monopoly by taking over the clientele
of the Melbourne Gaol, the other “shop - ’
is out to gain the patronage of all possible
customers. A signboard four-feet long read-
ing “To the Coburg Gaol and Female Prison”
has been prepared, but for the moment it
cannot be erected. The Coburg Council, pro-
testing that only a small percentage of its
ratepayers derive any benefit from the estab-
lishment, has refused permission to hoist
the board within the municipality. In the
circumstances, as it is getting near Cup-time,
when big business may be expected, might
I suggest to the managing-director of Pent-
ridge that he should try sky-signs?
* * * *
“T. 0.1.” : Apropos curious pub signs. In
the early days there were two taverns at the
intersection of Moor and Brunswick streets,
Fitzroy (Melb.), the Labor-in-Vain and, on
the opposite corner, the Perseverance. Over
the entrance to the former was a large pic-
ture representing two burly white men
vigorously scrubbing a black boy in a tub of
water with no apparent result. The Per-
severance had a similar picture, with this
essential difference, that the small coon in
the tub was emerging from the process half-
white.
* * * *
“A.V.A.” : Rc sticklers for spit and polish,
naval or military (B. 18/9/’24). My unit
in Palestine was blessed (or otherwise) with
a Tommy Major of Engineers, who one day
decided on an inspection parade in uniform.
All went well till he came on a hapless war-
rior with a mark on his ear. He had
shaved, but had left a small spot of soap
unremoved. The Major sentenced him to one
day No. 2 F.P., depriving him of a day’s
pay. After the Armistice that man applied
for Blighty leave, and was turned down on
account of that crime on his sheet; and it
was only after a lot of trouble that our
new Major (an Aussie) was able to get the
leave granted.
* * * *
“X2X” at a marriage feast: —
I, too, have vivid memories of a wild and woolly
wedding breakfast (B. 18/9/’24). It was in North
Queensland, the ’groom being a hefty, 16-stone
cutter, and the bride a local barmaid. The medical
superintendent of the local hospital and myself, under
whose joint care the cutter had recently been, were
seated alongside the happy couple, and proceedings
were beginning to liven up under the influence of
a demijohn of illicitly-distilled rum, when there
entered a rejected suitor of the bride with three
friends, all considerably the worse for liquor. The
leader briefly announced his determination to stoush
the groom, and then, with the aid of his friends,
to wreck everything in sight. Most of the lady
guests at once dived underneath the tables. Three
seconds later a tornado was raging, and food,
bottles and dishes were flying in all directions.
Three minutes later the four intruders were thrown
out in an unconscious or semi-conscious state, after
which most of the gentleman guests trooped across
to the hospital, a few hundred yards away, to have
their cuts and bruises attended to. The superinten-
RELATIVITY.
“The number of divorces are simply appalling.”
“Do you think so?—look at all the marriages there are!”
dent and myself, who had emerged from the fray
scathless, hurried on ahead, donned white overalls,
and met them when they arrived. While we were
busy with plaster and bandages, the ladies, including
the bride, restored order in the hall and straight-
ened things out, and half an hour later we all
went back and resumed the function at the point
where it had been left off. It takes more than
a little thing to upset a wedding breakfast in the
North.
* * * #
“Herodot”: Having acquired a fair-sized
cheque from a fencing job, Dinny Moran,
of the Five Mile,
decided that he
would order a
tailor-made suit for
the first time in his
life. In due course
the suit was fin-
ished, and Dinny
called to take de-
livery. The tail-r
pointed out the
smooth fit of the
coat around the
shoulders, and sug-
gested that Dinny
should take a
wooden coat-hanger
to preserve the
shape. Three or
four days later,
when the tailor
met Dinny in the
main street, lie
noticed that the
new suit had been
replaced by old
blue dungarees.
“What’s the matter
with the suit?”
asked the man of
cloth; “doesn’t it
fit?” “The suit’s
all right,” replied
Dinny. “It’s the
hanger that’s the
trouble. Every
time I turned my
head to one side it
caught me under the ear. and nearly scraped
it off. So I went back to the old blueys
again.”
* * * *
“Lot's Wife”: Scores of times in my boy-
hood I have seen a plate of salt laid on the
chest of a dead person in England. But not
as a protection against witchcraft (B.
18/9/‘24) : the idea was that the salt pre-
vented infection by absorbing all noxious
odors. The first occasion upon which I took
particular note of this sanitary rite, nearly
50 years ago, I had accompanied a certain
ghoul on his call to measure a recently-
defunct sea-captain who had succumbed to
hob-nailed liver. The plate of salt—well
heaped—lay on the corpse’s breast, and after
taking the correct coffin measurements, the
ghoul, who was consuming a light lunch of
nuts while on his professional duties, observed
to me that a pinch or two of salt was just
what he wanted.
* * * *
“Masen”: In Swanston-street, after a
short absence from Melbourne, I was
attracted by the glitter of policemen’s hel-
mets in the crowd ahead. I have a vulgar
weakness for riots, so I was soon on the spot,
having trampled on several better citizens in
my hurry. At the Collius-street corner a
desperate struggle was being waged by the
cohorts of the law, not against rioters or
hoodlums, but simply with the afternoon
traffic of the city. Altogether nine stal-
wart policemen were engaged at that one
crossing. At the Flinders-street corner another
desperate battle was in progress ; at this point
no less than 11 helmets were discernible
above the ranks of war. And then I real-
ised how serious this business of traffic con-
gestion is. The threat of tram and car
and thundering dray has never been very
terrible to me, but I seldom pick up a paper
now without a lively dread of reading that
someone has been crushed to death by police-
men.
* * * *
“Sr”: In the contractors’ room of the Vic.
Public Works offices, tacked up in a glass
cabinet, are two notices to tenderers that
have certainly done good service. One notice,
which advises contractors that they must
get permission to go to jobs in gaols and
asylums, is dated July 12, 1880; the other
asking the contractors not to pinch the plans
is dated 1886. They are both weather-
beaten, but they are still applicable, and so
they stand by order of the Minister.
* * * *
“Centurion”; An individual with multi-
farious responsibilities faced the N.S.W.
Registrar in Bankruptcy the other day to
explain how, though he had been making as
much as £5OOO a year, he had failed to keep
expenditure inside of income. He was, it
appeared, supporting a wife in another State
and a couple of children as well. Another
lady on the domestic pay-sheet ruled over
a mansion at Bellevue Hill, and here also
were children. Yet a third feminine encum-
brance dwelt at his expense in the same high-
class suburb, and this one enjoyed unlimited
credit at a big Sydney shop. Nothing much
was said about the Penelope in the other
State, but both the lasses of Bellevue Hill
had motor-cars, while the bankrupt himself
rejoiced in the possession of three. Atop of
which, the bankrupt citizen whose affairs were
under discussion casually mentioned that
he had lost a suit in Equity, owned two steam
launches, had promoted an insurance co. and
supported his aged father. It was a vivid
little sketch of a fairly crowded life, and it

Australia’s greatest trustee company estab-

the result partly of what may be regarded as
natural growth, partly of high values, partly
of more complicated methods of tax-extrac-

mum provided by the law. This last develop-
ment makes trustee work more difficult, and
so the private trustee is being displaced more
and more in favor of the expert. Ten years
ago it was thought by many that the N.S.W.
State office would prove a serious rival to the
trustee cos. Events have proved otherwise.
The Public Trustee has not got the big
estates, and is not likely to.
This year’s disclosed net profit is £24,703.
But a further £3556 has been added to the
Commission lieserved Account, which lifts
the profit to £28,259. A trustee co.’s commis-
sions are made up of 2* to 5 p.c. on the in-
come, according to amount and source, and
1 to 2* p.c. on the capital value of estates;
and a portion of the latter is “reserved” by
this co. and drawn upon as the trust
estate proceeds towards liquidation. The
div. rate is substantial and to original
holders is even better, on account of
the £25,000 of reserves capitalised between
1919-21. Yet the dividend is not eating inor-
dinately into profits, Yisibile reserves total
£167,012, and inner reserves may be liberal.
Premises certainly have been written up by
£2OOO, but that asset still figures at much
under present market price. Assets to the value
of over £300,000 are working for less than
half as much capital; and that should assure
a high rate of dividend —so long, of course, as
assets are sound. The net gain of new
estates over those wound up was, on the
year, almost If millions: a healthy increase
and almost as great as the 1922 advance. The
following comparisons show the Perpetual’s
progress:—

Expenses have advanced slightly, but the co.
can stand it; and, anyway, because of the
multitude and involved character of taxes
much more work has now to be done for
trust estates. In that connection, as indica-
tive of the extraordinarily cheap service offered
by trustee cos., the ratio of expense to the
total funds administered bv the P.T. is a
minute fraction over 6s. p.c. Following is
the condition of the co.’s own funds: —

Reserve . . . . £lOO.OOO £5OOO
Commission reserved.. 60,567 3556
Investments fluctuation 2,500

The Officers’ Provident Fund benefited by
£l5OO, but neither that amount nor the addi-
tion to the Officers’ Fidelity Insurance Fund
has been included in profits. Trustee cos.
will go on prospering. The expert service
rendered, the guaranteed efficiency, the low
charges, plus their permanence, make them
almost an essential to most fair-sized estates.
In the process of time, with keener competi-
tion they may be compelled to do more for
their money: but keen competition will be
slow in coming, because trustee cos. don’t
from their very nature hold out many attrac-
tions as investments for the first few years
of their life.

The decrease has moved the directors to
oratory running to almost five and a half
lines. Drought (which affects the salt “har-
vest”), keen competition, the financial strin-
gency and soaring wages are cited as the
causes. Despite these circumstances the
volume of trade has been maintained, and
the passing of some if not all of the
troubles is an anticipation which inspires
the directors with confidence as to the next
balance. The progressive increase in net
profits awakened hopes among pref. share-
holders of a better return. Pref. divs. rise
to 8 per cent, maximum if the ordinaries re-
ceive 12 p.c. or more. Last term, profits
available for ordinaries would have per-
mitted of a div. rate of 14 p.c. This term
the possible div. on ords. was not quite 10*
p.c. However, it is still a possibility; for
it has to be remembered that there is no
particular reason why a holding co. should
build up strong reserves. Particulars of the
subsidiary cos. are restricted to the mention
of the bare total of holdings, but there is no
reason to doubt that assets insure the fullest
security to the pref. shareholders. And
there is, additionally, the £35,838 of accu-
mulated profits, not to mention the reserves
which the subsidiary cos. may be accumulat-
ing.

C.A.S.E., generally known as “Case,” Ltd..
is growing apace. As a two-year-old it showed
promise which is fulfilled by its performances
in this its third year. The co. was formed
in Adelaide in 1921 to take over the Austra-
lian agency of the J. I. Case Threshing
Machine Co. of Wisconsin (U.S.A.), said to
be the world's biggest manufacturers of
tractors and agricultural machinery, and be-
gan with £33,936 of its capital represented
by goodwill, preliminary expenses and other
intangibles. To-day it is established in all
the mainland States, has increased its capi-
tal, and with charming ease has made pro-
fits sufficient to provide for a 10 p.c. div.
on ordinaries and substantially add to
its working capital. From the begin-
ning its conduct has been efficient. Its
chief business is in farm tractors, but
it is progressive and has large ambi-
tions. It had, moreover, the good luck
to arrive during exceptionally good seasons,
and that and its vigor have combined to pro-
duce a remarkable increase in turnover. Fur-
ther. the cash sales have been larger than
could have been hoped for under normal con-
ditions, and this has greatly helped finance.
Even as it is the co. has to lean heavily
on outsiders. This and other features are
shown by the following balance-sheet com-
parisons :
1923. 1924.
Capital .. .. £146,563 £216,959
Overdraft . . . . 41,863 62,450

Cash and investments 11,414 10,649
Goodwill . . . . 13,691 9,691
Preliminary exes... 15,000 18,000
The chief danger of a setback in turnover
and profits would lie in a widespread
drought. Dry conditions would certainly in-
crease the demand for tractors; but it would
make finance more difficult, partly by reduc-
ing the proportion of cash sales and partly
by slowing up the payments on t.p. sales.
So that varying local conditions may carry
due weight at headquarters, local boards have
been established in each State except Tas-
mania; and a “most satisfactory” agreement
has been entered into witli Westralian
Farmers. Ltd., to handle all Case goods in
W.A. The necessary steps have also been
taken to list the stock on the Exchanges;
and much propaganda work has been carried
on throughout the country, from which the
co. may reasonably expect to derive large
permanent benefits.

Born 59 years ago, the Ballarat Bank holds
the championship in its class. The honor is
achieved without difficulty : it is now the only
bank in Australia with headquarters outside
a metropolis. For over half a century it
confined its business to the one office; then it
decided that caution was satisfied, and it
capitalised £42,500 of reserves and opened a
branch down the street. These adventures
will probably have to suffice for some time.
The co. does very well, really, when it is re-
membered that Ballarat has been fading out
as a gold-producing centre and not making
the progress as an industrial centre that it
once promised to do. But if slow the business
ought to be sound. Dealing in a circum-
scribed area the management knows those
with whom it has to do —probably knew their
fathers and grandfathers—and that has
spelled safety even if it hasn’t spelled big
dividends. For long the earnings on funds—
reserves were as great as capital—were less
than six per cent., even though the dividend,
after much complaining, was lifted to 10 per
cent. Actually the annual return to share-
holders was even then less than £5 for every
£lOO of their money in the business. How-
ever. the position has bettered, and to holders
of 1920 or earlier who got in at par the
present div. is equal to 124 p.c. The expan-
sion has not changed the unusual composition
of deposits, 75 p.c. of which are fixed.
The following comparison goes back to the
period when the bank was moving very
slowly:—
1914. 1923. 1924.
Capital and reserves £174,836 £198.859 £201,409
Liabilities . . . . 237,150 329,548 348,993
Liquid assets . . 108,413 102,918 100,736
Advances . . . . 300,963 420,488 444,666
Premises . . . . 2,610 5,000 5,000
Seven years ago it held less than £1 7s. of the
public’s money for every £1 of its own.
Under average conditions an Australian bank
may with safety handle money in the propor-
tion of £8 to £l. The Ballarat last year held
less than £1 15s. for every £l. The com-
mon rule does not, however, apply to a one-
town bank. For one thing, if there is a
shrinkage of deposits, a bank with many
branches can call in a large amount of ad-
vances without making a stir, whereas a
one-town bank could do little in that way
without suggesting vague doubts about its
own credit and thus endangering other depo-
sits. The only safe policy for a bank so
placed is to use little outside money in pro-
portion to its own funds, and depend upon its
own banker —now the Commonwealth Bank
—to see it through in the unlikely event of
temporary trouble. But all this is very re-
strictive, and each year the hazard is made
as to how much longer the Ballarat will
resist absorption by some bigger concern.
But thei’e is a lot of “local patriotism” in
Ballarat: and it will fight hard to maintain
a bank that carries the old goldfields name.

Profits showed contraction last year; but
they still represented over 15 p.c. on capi-
tal. The div. was nevertheless dropped to 10
p.c., the balance of £20,682 going to strengthen
the already substantial reserves. And such
reserves are desirable, because, though efforts
have been made to cut out the speculative
part, the history of the co. shows that the
fields which the co. works are liable to violent
changes. The smaller div. for the term re-
duces to just over 9 p.c. the average yield to
the original investors in the co., which arose
in 1917 from the re-uniting of two concerns
that earlier had been in partnership.
The balance-sheet is taciturn, and hides a
lot of interesting information under one inoff-
ensive-looking little “etc.” The reserve for
depreciation and renewals shows a slight
shrinkage. But that fund is reasonably sus-
pected of still harboring some hidden profits.
Movements since the present co. was formed
have been as follows:
1918. 1921. 1923. 1924.
Paid capital. . £260,000 £400,000 £406,000

Stock, book debts and cash to the extent of
£2 17s. cover every £1 of liabilities. Under
the circumstances —and especially in view
of the high prices ruling for most of the
pastoral products from which the co. makes
its commissions—-the single note of optimism
in the report, that “prospects are brighter for
the ensuing year,” may be accepted at face
value.

The directors record their pleasure “in inti-
mating that they have capitalised the sum of
£50,000, by declaring out of reserve a special
bonus dividend of ss. per share, and simul-
taneously making a call of ss. per share.”
Five years ago £25,000 of gift scrip was
issued, and that was the first performance of
the kind; so. in view of the position dis-
closed by the balance-sheet, the directors can-
not be charged with unseemly haste in nail-
ing accumulated profits down. In fact, as
was pointed out in the “Wild Cat” years ago,
the co. would be well advised to convert more
of the reserves into capital by this process.
A very high dividend rate provokes attack
from people who don’t understand that much
of it is merely interest on shareholders’
money left in the business. The persons to
be first considered by the co. are policy-
holders ; and policy-holders, being concerned
with the dimensions of the funds and the
quality of the assets, are best served when
surplus reserves are converted into capital—
directors can’t then declare big cash-bonus
dividends and thereby weaken the policy-
holders’ security.

For the first nine years of the present cen-
tury the div. rate stood at 10 p.c. Since
then its progress lias been more or less
steadily upwards—as it ought to have been,
because £1 in dividends has shrunk in value
just as much as £1 in w r ages. But it is a
fine little gold-mine, for all that. Dividends
since 1000 represent more than three times
the paid capital, excluding the bonus shares:
and reserves have also been built up until
they are equal to four times the original
paid capital. Such figures are good reading
for the policy-holder, too; and there is, in
addition, the rest of the million of capital
still uncalled. He certainly need not worry
about Ms security.
Mortgages go on shrinking, and, so far
as can be judged, the investments which have
replaced them are of high quality. Further-
more, the more fluid nature of the bulk of
them better suits the business, because the
unexpected is an ever-present possibility in
fire and marine insurance. In the following
comparison of assets it will be noted that
mortgages now occupy second lowest place
in assets, whereas in 1914 they nearly
equalled all others combined
1914. 1921. 1923. 1924.

For years investments earned sufficient to
provide the div. Last year the amount was
within £845 of requirements. This year,
owing to the higher div., the difference is a
bit greater. Nevertheless, the vast bulk of
the underwriting profits will still be avail-
able for reserves.

Carter’s Hill, Rockley (N.S.W.), follow-
ing on a court case, went into voluntary
liquidation and emerges as the Carter’s Hill
Consolidated Gold Mines, N.L. The share-
holders will receive one ss. fully paid for
every two 2s. shares now held. This accounts
lor 75,000. A further 60,000 have been sub-
scribed. The nominal capital is £50,000 in
200,000 shares of ss. Reports of better gold
developments in the main shaft and of rich
assays are floating around. However, the
characteristics of the show' are that of a
shallow deposit in narrow' lodes in calcite,
with disappearing values below 100 ft.

Having been off the dividend list since
May, 1920, Carpathia T. M. Co., Ardlethan
(N.S.W.), returns to it on October 9 with
a distribution of 6d. on its 104,070 shares,
absorbing £2600 of its cash balances of £9150.
The announcement by chairman Markell at
the half-yearly meeting shortened proceedings
wonderfully. Since accounts closed on July
31 production has been at the rate of four
tons concentrates a week, so that the position
remains sound. Shortage of miners is affect-
ing the co.; otherwise, it is alleged, production
could be doubled. There still is a large area
of unprospected ground, butt the deepening
of the mainshaft has been abandoned for the
time being. A consulting-engineer will be
engaged to report on the mining and pros-
pecting position generally. The ore shoots
being worked are mostly leaders. These are
followed in the hope that they will make into
substantial bodies, past experience being the
guide in this respect.

Almost a year after the explosion at Bell-
bird colliery, one of the miners’ check inspec-
tors found gas present in such quantities in
Stockton Borehole (N.S.W.) that a naked light
or the firing of a shot would have caused a
disaster. This condition of things is caused
by the practice of slowing down the venti-
lating fans when the pit is idle at the week-
ends or is empty for other reasons. It
saves a bit of money; but is it worth the
risk? With a few exceptions, colliery owners
still persist in the use of the old oil safety-
lamp. South Maitland miners are now up
in arms on the question of the compulsory
installation of electric lights; and much as
they have alienated public sympathy in
the Northern district by their tactics of irri-
tation, on this question it is with them.
Nothing will insure a mine’s safety against
the ever-present fool who unlocks his oil
lamp to get a light for a forbidden smoke
except to take away the lamp, and with it
the management’s usual excuse for explo-
sions. No one can light up cigarette or
pipe at an electric lamp, and the compulsory
installation of these and the provision of
battery hand-lamps, would remove this risk,
the greatest that hangs over a miner’s job,
as well as remove the chief cause of nystag-
mus, which has taken a heavy toll in N. S.
Wales. Apart from the consideration of the
sight of the mine workers, oil safety-lamps
should be prohibited before another under-
ground holocaust emphasises the necessity—
too late.

Anakie gem-field (Q.) is scarcely booming,
but the recent satisfactory recovery in the
sapphire business was well maintained dur-
ing August. The month’s returns were
16320 z., value £2400. First-class blues are
worth £7 10s. an oz. at present, but only
2560 z. of the total was so graded. Mines
Minister A. J. Jones, lately back from Wem-
bley, reports excellent prospects ahead for
the highest class blues and “fancies.” Most
of the output is coming from well-worked
ground, and no new leads of any note have
been reported lately.

The prospecting committee at Lightning
Ridge opal-field (N.S.W.) has received a
further Government grant of £2OO. The
miners decided to appoint 10 parties, each
consisting of two practical men, to prospect
on sites to be chosen by a sub-committee.
A clause in the agreement provides for re-
payment of the prospecting aid by those
diggers who are fortunate enough to strike
payable claims.

“Shareholders have no cause for alarm,”
the secretary of Vimy Ridge, Bega
* N.S.W.), in a circular announcing another
3d. call. Continuing, he states that since
the last call was made about 250 tons ore
returned 103 oz. 15dwt. gold, with 2-ldwt.
to 3jdwt. per ton in the tailings. The
previous call was made on July 9, and nearly
three months with 10-head of stamps inter-
mittently at work have elapsed since, for
little more than lOoz. a week. The circular
states that as the main tunnel gets further
into the hillside the ore body enlarges, but,
although payable, becomes poorer. A rock-
breaker and automatic feeders have been re-
quisitioned ; but a cheaper method of convey-
ing ore to the battery is imperative, and the
call money might be utilised for driving a low-
level tunnel to serve the battery. At pre-
sent. ore is passed down the hillside per
medium of two horses attached to a slide,
and in wet weather this primitive outfit gets
bogged. The eo.’s 2s. 3d. paper is now worth
about 4d. in the market; it cost some of the
present holders 2s. 9d. The current levy
exhausts the co.’s calling powers. Maybe
shareholders have no cause for alarm; but
a lot of people have been alarmed with less
cause.
•ft * * *
Bribbaree, on the Stockinbingal-Forbes
(N.S.W.) line, has a reputation as a mys-
tery concern. Floated more. than a year
ago, it took over five-head of stamps from
the vendors, and if the battery hasn’t been
silent, the co. certainly has been silent about
the battery. Four months ago a start was
made on the erection of a second-hand 10-
head mill, and the job is said to be nearing
completion. Including 60 tons taken over
with the lease the co. has 150 tons of ore
at grass. Manager Williams’s latest report
mentioned that stopes had been opened up
over the No. 3 South-East level, “showing
from 6in. to 15in. of good-quality stone."
Thirteen tons were hauled from here in the
fortnight, and live tons in the preceding like
period. That low total makes curiosity par-
donable. The 50,000 eontribs. have 3s. 3d.
paid on them, and maintain a premium of Od,
in the market. If the co. has any large ore
bodies in reserve its modesty is something
uncommon in Pitt-street mining.

“Anhydrous” on oil-field development:—
If ever an oil-field is found in the Commonwealth,
it is to be hoped that the Mines Departments take
warning from the case of Signal Hill, California.
No more wonderful oil-field has been discovered; a
“wild cat” bore put down by the Standard Oil, and
not geological guidance, located the reservoir. The
average size of the town blocks is about 40ft. x 60ft.
The discovery of oil was followed by a wild scramble
for land, and many of the lots were sold on the
basis of the owner being paid a percentage of the
oil recovered. There being no Mining Department
in California like those in Australia, a race com-
menced to get wells down. The oil-sands were deep,
mostly about 4000 ft., hence each “well” was costly,
but as every allotment owner had to have his share
of the oil and no pooling arrangement could be
settled to the satisfaction of the parties, wells were
put down on each lot. In many instances there were
three or more wells on one block. The result of
this close boring was that the gas pressure was dis-
sipated, and where the average oil recovered from
Californian fields is reckoned at about 50 p.c. of
the oil in the sands, the Signal Hill field, through
losing the gas pressure, is only recovering about
20 p.c. One other Californian field has been ruined in
the same way. An example of a well-drilled field is
the Burkbanlc. It is laid out in squares of 160 acres,
and 16 wells are bored to each section ; thus the gas
pressure is properly utilised and recoveries of oil
are high. There are difficulties in the way of
making regulations for a situation like that men-
tioned, but there is nothing to stop a regulation
preventing oil bores being put down closer than, say,
150 ft. to 200 ft. from each other. The vagaries of oil
are strange. Wells bored within a few feet of each
other at Signal Hill show one to be a flowing
well and the other to be dry. The old Cornish
dictum, “where ’tis, there ’tis” is particularly applic-
able to oil.
* * # *
E. C. Wright, of Brisbane, is reported to
be opening up the Ban Ban zinc lode, the
biggest of its kind in Queensland. It is 20
miles from rail at Degilbo, on the Gayndah
line, and tractors will transport the concen-
trates. The lode makes an enormous crop,
which has been traced for the best part of
a mile and for a width of up to 50ft.
* * * *
There is nothing very heartening in the
oil situation in Queensland at present, and
official optimism has sagged to an indescrib-
able flatness. Silence as heavy as a smoke
pall hangs over Orallo. and little information
has been given out lately, although it is
known that technical difficulties have been
met. Arthur Moore is out of the business
at present. His show came too late to bene-
fit from the Lander boom. So his skill and
training are not employed in the great search.
The Tewantin bores under the new co. are
being sunk with energy, and cautious re-
ports by L. C. Ball punctuate operations.
He hasn’t the optimism of Dr. Jensen. The
A.O.C. is still sinking at Beaudesert, and
reports small shows of oil and gas in drill-
ings. Arthur Morry still pursues his lonely
way at Woolston in the Triassic coal mea-
sures. The gloom following the oil-boom of
six months ago has only been relieved by the
way in which Arthur Moore has hauled Min-
ister Jones over the coals in the Brisbane
press for his imprudent utterances.

The latest report of Mt. Isa Prop. (Q.)
contains plenty of figures; but where the
yield is rich the quantity is small. Values
continue variable.

On her last trip from the Gulf of Car-
pentaria, the Kallatina dropped 100 tons
of silver-lead ore at Cairns to go to the
Chillagoe State Smelters. The ore comes
from the recently re-opened mine at Lome
Hills, south-west of Burketown, in the Gulf
country.
* * * -ft
Mt. Jackson, which at present is F. W.
Cuthbert’s silver-lead hope on the Etheridge
(N.Q.), is not yet cleaned out, but mining
operations should be in full swung by the
end of the month. Cuthbert sent away 260
tons to Chillagoe from the old ore-dumps
for a return of £1441. of which the local
carriers claimed £4OO to land the ore on
’’nils. There would be little in this after
all charges, including running costs, were
met. The show will have to hand out better
ore to have much chance of a long run.
-X- * * *
Interest lias revived on the old Lome
Hills silver-lead field, Burketown district
(N.Q.). A number of leases have been
pegged, and at present about 30 men are
gouging or holding ground. The idea is that
the lodes are on a continuation of the Mt.
Isa mineral belt. A company is being-
formed to handle the lower-grade ores on
a large scale. Some rich galena veins, one
up to 4ft. thick, have been opened, and
they offer a prospect of substantial suc-
cess. There is a move on foot to have a
geologist sent to size up the lodes and advise
on development.

“An Old Miner” on Queensland coal:—
Randolph Bedford says that if production were
transferred to the privately owned Blair Athol, it
would badly pinch good unionists at Styx and
Baralaba. In reply I ask him: What of the good
unionists who have been badly pinched at Blair
Athol through the transference of the trade from that
place to the State mines? During the 14 years that
Blair Athol supplied the coal for Government use, a
large number of good unionists settled here and
built homes, and thus absorbed their savings for years.
When the State mines opened these men were invited
to leave their homes and live in tents and bag
humpies in fever-stricken country. Many of them
had to comply, as the alternative was unemployment.
He tells us that Baralaba is not now working at a
loss. I prefer to wait until I see the Auditor-
General’s figures. Similar statements in the past
were proved incorrect. He also tells us that as
soon as the new shafts at Styx are down and opened
out, coal will be produced at a profit. Does he
forget that the Government used the diamond drill
at the Styx for upwards of two years to find settled
country, and that two shafts put down and still
sinking have passed through a seam which lias
proved a duffer? Can Randolph Bedford assure us
that the next seam will be any better ? As for
the high quality of Styx coal from the old shaft,
no one disputes that, and no one disputed the
quality of Warra coal, yet the mine had to be
abandoned owing to high cost of production.
* * * *
Chemical Supply Co. (W.A.) has induced
the Westralian Labor Government to lend
8U miles of light rails to link its immense
manganese deposit at Horseshoe with Meeka-
tharra. Estimates of visible tonnage vouched
for by the State Mining-Engineer and others
run into millions, and, after paying every-
body and for everything both on the spot
and at port of delivery abroad, a clear profit
of a pound or two per ton is reckoned on.
The co. proposes to increase its capital.
* * * *
Another old has-been, the St. George, at
Leonora (W.A.), is being worked again. For
a time it was one of the best producers north
of Kalgoorlie; but that was years ago. Since
then it has yielded very little, but the usual
hopes are entertained.
* * * *
The two Emu blocks (W.A.). just pur-
chased by the Mararoa Go., have been
named the Mararoa Reedy Group. _ These
claims were first tried by working miners in
1915. Afterwards two Perth syndicates suc-
cessively butted in, but soon backed out.
Finally the Mararoa came along and decided
to stay. For a time the workers and local
pub and storekeepers may pluck the Emus
with profit, but the chances of shareholders
ever getting anything are remote.
* * * *
Hampton Consolidated (W.A.) is recon-
structing to acquire a S. African property.
This co. was formed in 1920 to take over
the Gwalia Central at Leonora, and for
months shareholders were buoyed up with
glowing reports and hints of a big rise in
shares. Then this cheerful broadcasting
ceased suddenly, and nothing has been heard
about the show since.
* * * *
Oroya East, a Westralian failure with a
little Adelaide backing, has been inspected
by another expert, and the usual hopes of
success “at depth” are offered as bait to
call-shy shareholders. Not long ago it was
reported that sufficient gold was in sight to
satisfy everybody. Now it is stated that
without a mill on the ground it can’t be
profitably extracted. This show belongs to
a class quite common in the West. It is
quite correct to say there is gold in them, but
between gold and gold in payable quantities
lies a world of difference.
* * * *
Bullfinches (W.A.) are being inquired for
on the offchance of the co. buying the old
Gladsome, at Comet Yale (W.A.). Years
ago this show was mined to 600ft., and about
a quarter of a million sterling was extracted,
mostly from above the 400ft. level. Then the.
workings were flooded from the abandoned
Sand Queen adjoining and operations had
to cease. Later on an effort was made to
drain both mines from the Sand Queen shaft,
but it was unsuccessful. A fair-sized shoot
is alleged to be under water in the bottom.
Bullfinch is therefore faced with a new and
expensive development scheme and the cost
of a pumping plant to deal with a sea of
brine; after that it has to search for ore
which, as in the case of the Sand Queen,
may not prove payable in deeper ground.
The outlook is nothing to cause a market
flutter.

A record for monthly production was
established for July by the Rand—829,4370z.
For the first seven months of the current
year output was 5,533,4720 z., an increase of 5
p.c. over that of the corresponding period of
1923. This is only the second occasion the
yield has exceeded 800,000 oz. A record for
the year seems assured.
“Oil Zany” gives some good oil:
Where boring for oil is being conducted I have
always suggested enclosing the rig and plant by
a corrugated-iron fence. “Keep out” ought to be
painted across the gate, and inside, there should be
a fierce bulldog and a sentry armed with a sawn-oil'
d.-b. shot-gun. Lander Co., at Orallo (Q.), has
just reported losing its No. 1 borehole because some
miscreant had either dropped a bar of angle-iron
down the hole or interfered with the drill stem. This
is a common trick on Yankee oilfields. Roma bore
was placed out of action in a similar manner. Our
oilmen should take precautions, because history
shows that} all kinds of strange things happen when
the interests of a big monopoly are threatened. It
would be hard without special electric fishing tools
to get that stem up and free the Orallo hole for
further drilling.

these days.” Then: “Lemme see, what suburb
is your darn circus in?”
One of the prizes in the Edward Filene
Peace Essay competition came to Australia,
the Speck’s Statistician, Major L. F. Giblin,
having annexed one of the 20 tenners
awarded. The biggest prize, £lOOO, went to
Bolton Waller, of Bray, County Wicklow,
Ireland; Norman Angell came third (£100).
Giblin, son of a former Premier and Judge
of the Speck, was one of the many brainy
youths who Avon honors at Hobart’s historic
Hutchins School. At IS he got away to
England on a scholarship. After three years
at University College he gained an exliibi-.
tion which secured him a three-year course
in higher mathematics at King’s. At Cam-
bridge a double blue came his way—football
and rowing—and he played international
Rugby for a couple of seasons. After wander-
ing over the earth and various more or
less successful literary adventures (includ-
ing the part-authorship of a jiu-jitsu text-
book), Giblin returned to Tasmania and went
on the land at Seven Mile Beach, within
easy walking or biking distance of Hobart
schools and the University, where he taught
mathematics, and lectured, and generally
pedagogued while his mixed farm was blossom-
ing into crops. In 1013 he was elected to
the Assembly as a Labor member; then the
war called, and Giblin went off as a captain
and returned a Major, D.S.O. and M.C. He
is now Tas. Statistician, and his wife is a
leading lady in the Women’s Non-Party
League, and an interesting speaker on League
of Nations activities and cognate subjects.
The N.S.W. black-soil country lost its
oldest pastoralist when “Woods, of Wood-
park,” joined the sheep up aloft at S 4. Sixty-
two years ago he went to those parts pioneer-
ing. and his sheep soon became as well
known as himself at the shows where eockies
gather.
The Sargent family which built its
moderate fortune on Mrs. Sargent’s pies has
had a disastrous year. First the original
Sargent died; then his busy wife; and last
week, after a long illness, lately mental,
Foster Hartley Sargent, whom the old people
left behind in the business, was found broken
to pieces at the foot of a 300 ft. cliff in the
Blue Mountains. A public co. took the pies
over some years ago.
Governor Stradbroke became a victim of
the uncertain Vic. weather as soon as he
returned from his explorations in Central
Australia. His Ex. was ill-advised enough
to go up to the State shack at Macedon, and
there ’flu struck him. He had to hold a
meeting of the Executive Council in his bed-
room, with Disney, the unportfolioed Upper
Chamber Minister, and Beckett a safe dis-
tance away from the patient. Still, he might
have deputised Cussen to act for him for a
week or two, especially as his Honor’s hand
was in. He had just previously acted as a
deputy-deputy for Lord Forster to swear in
Hill as Federal Minister.
G. W. Gray, Queensland M.L.C. and Min-
ister without portfolio from 1894 onwards,
is dead in Brisbane. He was chairman of
the Oastlemaine Brewery for years, and was
on the Board of the Q. N. Bank, the Queens-
land Trustees and the Millaquin Sugar Re-
finery. To the end he was a liberal patron
of sport: in his own young days he partici-
pated in the first international cricket match
played in Australia. .
Lord Long of Wraxall, whose death at
the age of 70 was reported last week, fur-
nished an example of how a plodding, indus-
trious, honest party politician, without bril-
liance or initiative, can rise almost to the
highest position in British public life. At
one time or another since he entered the
House of Commons in 1880 he held half a
dozen different portfolios in Unionist Admin-
istrations, and when Balfour resigned the
leadership of the Tory party, then in oppo-
sition. it looked as if Walter Long might get
the vacant job. At all events it seemed a
toss-up between him and Austen Chamber-
lain, and it was precisely because the claims
of each—the Wiltshire squire and the Bir-
mingham manufacturer—were so warmly
championed by the two different sections of
the party that in the interests of solidarity
it was finally decided to pass over both in
favor of a third candidate, Bonar Law. The
connection of the Longs with Wiltshire goes
far back into history—an ancestor repre-
sented the county in a fourteenth-century
House of Commons. But Walter had once to
look to Dublin for constituents, and he fin-
ished his Commons career as a London
member.
While he was Governor of Maoriland Sir
James Fergusson bought a big lumo of Wai-
kato land at a few shillings an acre. That
was in 1873-74. before Strawberry had begun
to turn the Waikato grass into gold. Sir
James’s son, who will shortly arrive as
Governor-General, will only be able to
lament that his father knew when to buy but
not when to hang on.
Capt. .Tames Thirsk, who has taken his
last berth in Adelaide, was in the Samoa
hurricane of 1889, and was wrecked in the
Monarch on Wardang Island. His first
Australian landfall was made in the little
steamer Ready, which he brought across
from South Africa just after two dredges
about the same size had utterly disappeared
while making the same trip.
Looking thinner and rather dressier than
when he left. Jack Pennington, M.L.A. for
Kara Kara, Chairman of the Vic. Commission
for the Wembley Show, has got back to Mel-
bourne after a six months’ trip. He was
lucky to be returned unopposed to the House
in his absence. Barnes will be back soon,
and McPherson, who has also been globe-
trotting will step off the Transcontinental
on October 21. The score will then be 18
all between the Peacock following and the
other three sections of the Opposition—the
Farmers’ Union 12, the Disgruntled Liberal
five, and Jimmy McLachlan, the truly rural
Independent.
Celestial personalities in the spotlight:—
The Christian Feng Yu-hsiang is a heavy-jowied
Chinese Cromwell, whose troops, trained on t.lie
Prussian model, commence their day with prayer and
psalm-singing, are not allowed to smoke or swear,
fight when required like a crateful of pythons, and
are not above a little looting when the opportunity
offers. Chang Tso-lin is an ex-bandit with the
appearance and tastes of an anamiie scholar, but
under his rule Manchuria has become the best organ-
ised and most prosperous province of China. He
invoked the aid of the Sun of Heaven, which implies
an intention to restore the monarch}'. Wu Pei-fu
is an honest militarist but a poor politician. He can
always be trusted to fight well and then hand the

Meat Board of N. B. Wales.
fruits over to the intriguing mob at Peking. Sun
Yat-sen is a bullet-headed Cantonese with socialistic
leanings who is too busy in Canton at present main-
taining the equilibrium between his own constitutional
government, the armed communists and the merchant
volunteers to worry the situation elsewhere. Tsao
Kun, the president, is a wealthy man, otherwise he
could not be president. Premiers come and go
almost weekly because few men can afford to pay the
price Parliament demands for election. Waiting
conveniently in the wings in his palace at Peking
is the ex-Emperor, an intelligent boy whom R. F.
Johnstone, the English Buddhist scholar and ex-civil
servant, is bringing up in the way he should go
as a possible constitutional ruler of China.
“T. 0.1.”: I have never been able to accept
the tradition that Mrs. Rebecca Oakes, born
Small, was the first white child delivered in
Australia. She came to us on September
22, 1789. Now, the First Fleeters landed
in Sydney Cove on January 26, 1788, 20
months prior to Rebecca’s birth, and in the
Fleet were 28 women and 17 children, wives
and offspring of marines, and of exiled
females there were 192, with 18 children. In
the careful keening of the Mitchell Library
is a manuscript journal of a First Fleet
officer, in which lie describes the raid by
male convicts on the tents or huts of the
women on the first night that the latter
were on shore. No; what with one thing
and another I can’t believe that no child
was born in the new settlement before 20
months had elapsed.
“Billy” Pagan, formerly Deputy-Commis-
sioner of Queensland Railways, died a few
days back. He did engineering work first
in Scotland, then in South America and
Jamaica, and Australia got him in 1878.
After a while in N. S. Wales he went north,
and became chief engineer in 1901 and
Deputy-Commissioner in 1911. Death called
at 78.
“M.”: Apropos the Ipswich (Q.) tradi-
tion that a local blacksmith, Hugh Campbell,
repaired a dray-axle of Leichhardt’s, and was
thus one of the last persons to have speech
with the explorer (B. 18/9/’24), the trouble
is that no wheeled vehicle of any kind formed
part of the explorer’s equipment. He had a
dray when he set out for Port Essington in
1844. but before he had gone far he decided
that it was an obstacle to his progress, so he
swapped it for a couple of working bullocks,
to be used as pack animals. In neither of
his later expeditions did he have a dray or
even a wheelbarrow.
At 75 George W. B. Story is exchanging
the manager’s chair in Sturmfels, Ltd., of
Brisbane, for a seat on the Board. Born
in Vic. in 1849, he is one of the oldest Old
Boys of Geelong Grammar, which he entered
in ’59. In ’76 he earned the Royal Humane
Society’s gold and silver medals by rescuing
a man, woman and baby from drowning. In
the Speck for a while, he left it for Banana-
land in ’B2 to manage Burgorah and Dareel
stations for the late C. B. Fisher. He started
Story Bros.. Seaton and Co., in Cunnamulla
(Q.), in ’B5; their brand was WES.. i.e.,
himself, a brother, C. V. Seaton, F. Gruber
and S. .T. Fletcher. In Cunnamulla he was
agent for Cobb and Co., editor of the War-
rego Herald, and secretary of the hospital.
Jockey Club, School of Arts and United
Graziers’ Association. As M.L.A. for the
Balonne in ’96 he helped to start the present
method of educating bush children.
STEFANSSON’S FIND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
‘ The Australian squatter combines the courtly
manners of America’s Southern planter with the
horsemanship and recklessness of the Western cow-
boys.”—Vilhjalmur Stefansson to a New York
audience.
Grave, ceremonious, full of pride of birth
As any old Castilian grandee
And consciousness of all that caste is Avorth—
And wool —and dignity.
Yet at a moment’s notice you may see
Him leap aboard his—Avhat’s the word? —Cay use,
And, whooping, tear across the countryside
Like those wide-panted centaurs that one vieAVs
Upon the films Avho hell-for-leather ride
To save a tart from harm or lynch a cur—
Our squatter, as explored by Vilhjalmur I
Seignorial, stately, rich in courtly grace
And sense of savoir jaire and comme il faut,
You’d deem a drawing-room his proper place,
Yet ’tisn’t really so,
He shines as brightly at a rodeo.
No saddle-feat he finds too hazardous,
Be it to rope a steer or help a donah,
His are the manners of Virginia, plus
The Avhirling horsemanship of Arizona.

“8.5. A.” : Pommies are not the only ones
who make the blunders. A squatter in the north
of South Aus. found that his car needed benzine and

of petrol in the tank.” He did. and ruined till the

“Anaf”: Western N. S. Wales adobe
houses are becoming more and .more common,
especially in the districts that get it really hot.
The wonder is that the cool and comfortable structures
are not universal, seeing that they are so fitted to
both climate and needs. They require little skill
to build, and where circumstances are favorable the
cost is only about a fifth that of a weatherboard
house. Moreover, when care is taken in the mixing
and building of the ’dobe, they' will last just as
long as timber, or longer, and they are’ free of the
insect pests which wooden dwellings harbor.

“Te Pana” : The Maoris may be poor sea-
men now (B. 11/9/’24), but their early migrations
proved their navigating skill. Nor did they stick at
canoes. In the early part of last century a remnant
of the fighting Ngatiawa tribe seized the British
windjammer Rodney and sailed her to the Chatham
Islands, where they lapped up the plump and well-
nurtured Morioris, who held possession. The crew
knew nothing of the workings of a compass, and the
stars were their only guide.
“Bouragi”: "Whatever tlie Maori is as a seaman
now, he knew all about it once. Even in recent day-
Frank Bullen and Charles Dana gave the Maori sea-
men and boatmen of the sperm whalers a good
reputation, and the Maori seaman was valued among
Pacific navigators down to quite late y'ears. As 10
inter-island ant inter-group voy'ages in the Western
Pacific, there are lashings of them. The Tongans
used often to visit Fiji in sailing canoes, and the
Marshall islanders were acclaimed the finest navi-
gators of them all. They made charts, consisting of
a square frame, strung like a tennis racket with
crossed strings. Dotted about were small lumps
of coral showing the positions and distances of the
islands, the chart being oriented by always turning
the same side to the rising sun. Even bush natives
in the Pacific islands are well up in knowledge of
the positions of the stars, and our own aboriginals
also had a lot of this knowledge and used it.

“F.N.W.”: I have brought to Sydney a
little visitor who is now competing a tour of the
world. He is a South African dwarf chameleon, and
possesses 3Jin. of body and
about as much tail. He
joined the ship at Cape Town,
and has duly noted the land-
scape around Las Palmas, Lon-
don, Middlesborough, Reigate,
etc., and on his return to Cape
Town on the Barrabool ex-
pressed a wish to proceed east-
wards to Australia in order to
carr y out research work iir the
eradication of the fly-pest.
Although no civic welcome was
extended to the visitor on ar-
rival at Fremantle, he dined
luxuriously on 3o assorted flies
and found their Australian
bouquet excellent. At present
Dopey, as he is called owing co
his slothful habits, is provid-
ing himself with a new skin—
doubtless at enormous expense
—in order to appear at his
best. Observation shows that
the general idea of his color-
changing activities is exagger-
ated. As a rule he is dark-
green, with reddish lines in
places. I have seen him almost
black, a very fair grey, fawn
and a very light green; but
if he has a larger repertoire
than these, he is keeping it in
reserve. He has lasted out

my hand after I have dipped it in water.
His eyes are swivelled and roll round in
the manner of a searchlight, and as they work
independently they are quite uncanny to watch. With
over 20,000 miles to his credit Dopey confidently
claims to be the most-travelled chameleon in the
world, although my Norwich canary—who is now
making his tenth round voyage—registers some
260,000 and considers Dopey a mere tripper.

“Moe” : Judging by “A.M.R.’s” description
of native magic in the New Hebrides (B. 11/9/’24),
the brand differs from the kind in use in New Guinea
in one important respect—the latter is believed to
be efficacious against white men. Instances of New
Guinea sorcerers having tried to work evil against
white men are fairly common, and in connection
with these capers there have been some curious
A BLEEP OR, AWAKE.
“I suppose you’ll spend that shilling I’ve given you on beer.”
“Beer, lady! Why, that’s the larst thing I dream of.”
“Yes, and the first tiring you think of.”
happenings. It has often been said that when a
European has been in New Guinea long enough, he
begins to believe in devils and other creepy products
of the country, although he does not admit it, even
to himself. Some years ago in Dutch New Guinea
a paradise-bird hunter fell foul of a local wizard,
with the result that the latter announced to his
followers that he intended to cause the death of
the white man. He commenced operations by pre-
paring a small image of the other. (Incidentally,
this is one of the oldest and most widely-used
methods of working black magic; there are records
of an English seventeenth-century trial in which a
woman was charged with having brought about the
death of her husband in this way.) Then he stuck
a splinter of wood through the chest of the image
and placed it in the fork of a tree. In due course
the news reached the white man, who had been in
New Guinea nearly 30 years; and, although lie
made fun of the sorcerer’s efforts, it was plain that
inwardly he was badly shaken. Four days afterwards
he died suddenly, probably from the combined effects
of a malaria-affected heart, a system saturated with
30 years of quinine, and fear. The local natives
immediately ascribed his death to the magic, and
the stock of the sorcerer, who was at only the begin-
ning of his professional career, rose tremendously.

“Jerplilin”: In 1906 I took a two-year-old
filly from Cassilis (N.S.W.) to the Marthaguy River,
200 miles from her birthplace. A year afterwards
I alternately rode and packed her to Goorimpa station
on the Paroo, than back to Killara on the Darling.
I lost her there for some months. A year afterwards
I lost her again at Gulgong, but found her safe
and sound in the paddock where she was foaled at
Cassilis. She was then five years old, and had gone
back the 60 miles from Gulgong through mountainous
country which she had never been over previously.
And I knew a dog once —but that’s another story.

“Nitric” : Re “B.S.A.’s” par. (B. 11/9/’24)
on an abo. tracker's olfactory development versus
that of a dingo. At a marriage ceremony at Dar-
win (N.T.) only the other day a valuable diamond
ring went . a-missing. The police were called in
and a “nose-tracker” (aboriginal) was brought to
the place. He entered the room full of white people
and declared a blackfellow had been present. Ten
minutes later he caught the individual on the beach
among a party of 10 other abos. Which also has
a bearing on a recent Bulletin argument concern-
ing distinctive racial body odors. Apparently there
are characteristic individual smells also.

“Henry Pannikin”: How’s this for a hard-
ware diet? A big emu recently killed in W. Queens-
land contained four pennies, five half-pennies, nine
2iin. nails, five marbles, one pump-connection, one
umbrella ferrule, one key, one medal, one clock-
wheel, two studs, three buttons, one safety-pin, two
staples, three washers and 24 pieces of broken china.
Also a large pin was found embedded in the liver.
He was only a young bird, but he seems to have
been a busy one.
“Mag”: A few days ago two of our chaps
on horseback were hunting up cattle. The day being
a thirsty one, they made for a waterhole. Dismoun 1 -
ing, they knelt and
started to clear the
scum away. Suddenly
one jumped up roar-
ing “I’m bitten by a
snake!” Although no
snake could be seen,
the sliprails were
quickly' let down, anil
his mate made a care-
ful investigation of his
rear peninsula. There
he observed two well-
defined punctures, with
blood oozing therefrom.
Like the true mate he
was, he slashed with a
knife across the pune-
tures, and then sucked
vigorously. Hurriedly
adjusting the sliprails
they mounted and rode
like blazes to the near-
est doctor. After a
while the sufferer said
he could not go any
further without a
drink, as his tongue
was swelling. This was
a fact, and not only'
swelling, but also turn-
ing black. Identifying
another waterhole, the
mate held the reins of
the other’s horse while
he dismounted and
again knelt for a drink.
Immediately he jumped
up horrified. “I’m
bitten again! I’m
bitten again!” he
shouted. Although the
joke was on the mate
for the sucking part,
he with laughter.
This time he had seen
the whole performance.
The snake’s fangs were
the long spikes in the
Vowel of an extended
shank on one spur.
Yet if it had not been
for that second water-
hole results might have
been serious.

she roamed the Tas. forests until all her people were
exterminated by the white invaders, Lucy only
escaping, “the last of the Tas. race.” the portrait
shows a black with snow-white head of hair, also
a short hairy growth on lip and chin. As the last

LONGUN : “Last night I heard a burglar
breaking into our place. You should
have seen me going downstairs—three
steps at a time!”
SHORTUN ( who knows Longun): “Great
Scott, what Was he doing on the roof?"
in 1876, there is some mystery attached to Lucy.
Who can clear it up? The skeleton of Truganina,
beautifully articulated and mounted in a glass case,
attracts much notice from visitors to the Hobart
Museum.

THE LAST OF THE COACHES
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Federal Minister Pearce has turned down the
suggestion that the last of Cobb and Co.’s coaches
should be preserved in the National Museum at
Canberra, on the the ground that there is at present
no suitable accommodation.”
Cheer loud for the last of the coaches,
Come in with its dust from the west!
Cheer loud for the something that broaches
The national blood of your breast!
Up, up for the last of the coaches,
Come in from its journeys to rest!
Done well, done well, old cobbers —you have rung
the rafters well,
With a cheer to stir the jobbers to the very depths
of Hell;
The jobbers who are living, and the jobbers gone
before—
Lot’s forget and be forgiving for the sake of some-
thing more!
What’s the odds though Pearces quibble on a twist-
ing Senate fence,
Breathe excuses weak and dribble in the shadow of
pretence V
Men will hear and will remember, though these
ancient wheels may rot,
When the Honorable Member and his colleagues are
forgot.
For the last of all Cobb’s coaches may be kept or
may be lost,
And the future that approaches may be calm or
tempest tossed ;
Put the history is written, though the hand that
wrote it’s dead,
And the cold earth is its mitten and its comfort
and its bed.
No, this old coach shall not vanish, for the men un-
born will see,
Though the men now living banish all such links of
history.
Rolling on past bush and clearing, down the spread-
ing western plains,
They will go with it careering, Henry Lawson at
the reins.
Through the distant Never Never —and it will be
distant then—
They will ride by bush and river with a host of
rugged men ;
With old Sweeney and his trouble, and the cove
who’s “mostly Bill,”
And the shade of someone’s double who rides on by
spur and hill.
They will pass the slip-rails standing where the
timid kiddies stare;
Catch a glimpse of cattle-branding and a sniff of
scorching hair ;
They will know again the diggings and the stations
further west,
Where the miners fixed their riggings, and the
drovers spurred their quest.
They will know the drought, the breaking, and the
trials and the strife
Or the days when men were staking something even
more than life.
They will meet by hut and station, tall and brown
but gentle-eyed.
Splendid mothers of a nation, and they’ll lift their
hats for pride.
Yes, in Henry Lawson’s coaches, that were run by
Cobb and Co.,
They will find the old approaches to the nation that
they know.
They will hear again the laughter, turn in pity at the
tears,
And they'll shake to-morrow’s rafter with the roar of
mighty cheers.
So, up for the last of the coaches,
Come in with its dust from the ivest,
Cheer, cheer for the something that broaches
The national blood of your breast.
Oh, up for the last of the coaches
Come in from its journeys to rest.
VICTORIA.

MARK TWAIN, in his
book “Following the Equa-
tor,” on Page 233, writes
regarding the GREAT
WESTERN VINEYARDS:
“It yields a choice cham-
pagne. . . . The champagne
is kept in a maze of pas-
sages underground, cut in
the rock, to secure it an
even temperature during
the three-year term re-
quired to perfect it.

“Spenncr” : If “John Wellington’s” ex-
pert’s figures are correct (B. 21/8/’24) then the
Maoriland bunny can run away from his Australian
brother in the matter of multiplication. True, does
may commence at 15 weeks, but in Australia breeding
continues only while there is green feed. About 90
per cent, of bunnies therefore arrive between June
and October, and only the first—and occasionally
the second —litter breed the same year.

“Sandys”: I had the box seat. The driver’s
family never stayed the same size for long, so I
asked him how many there were now. “Well,
now! About 10, 1 should say.” “And how old’s
the tenth?” “Oh well, now. He’d be six months
about.” “And what did you call Atm?” He scratched
his head. It was hard work. To help him I
suggested that perhaps they hadn’t named him.
“Well, now—we named him orright. But blow me
if I can remember what we did name him.” When
I heard later that he was Hector Horatius Claud, 1
understood —that part of the business was surely
left to mother.
• * * *
“Two Seas” : About this time last year I
related how a pair of magpies had their happy home
broken up by the fall of a lofty tree in which they
had their selection. They built afresh in a smaller
tree in my front garden and reared a family. The
same pair are now building adjacent to their old
flat but nearer to the ground, and only about 12 ft.
from the window through which I view their opera-
tions. Evidently the fall of their home last year
is not forgotten: their instinct is to build out on
the end of a branch of a lofty tree, but in this ease
they have built so low that one could almost touch
the nest from the ground with a walking-stick. By
THE CULT OF CLEANLINESS.
DAT (to visitor): “And there’s the toothbrush chained up there.
You can't trust some of these shearer cores.”
the way, it is the old man who does all the building.
The missus is the architect, and judging by this
fierce arguments she raises 1 think the old man is
frying to dodge the specifications.

“Numbugga” : The disease among native-
bears about, 40 years ago, recently referred to in
the Council, was not limited to one State, but
ravaged practically the whole of the coast and table-
lands of Southern Queensland, N. S. Wales and Vic-
toria. Unfortunately little notice was then paid to
that outbreak, but the matter was taken up seri-
ously about 14 years ago, when several German
specialists investigated the disease. Many bushmen
claimed that it was cancer, sores developing on each
side of the skull. Naturally, after such a lapse of
time, it was difficult to secure skeletons for research
work, but a few were forwarded to Germany for
closer investigation, with what result I haven’t
heard.
“Troophorse”: “C. Coral” and “Parama”
(B. 7/8/ ’24) have been praising the Jap diver for
working down to 40 fathoms. How about a litcls
White Australia on the subject ? Several years ago
D. A. Carruth, a weli-
known diver who has
worked the coasts of
New Guinea and Torres
Strait, in giving his
evidence before a Royal
Commission inquiring
into the pearl shelling
and fishing industry,
swore that he had
worked in 30 fathoms
at Darnley, but re-
marked that it was not
a white man’s job. To
be at sea in a small
15-ton pearling lugger
for a couple of months
in rough weather and
on rough tucker is no
chop. While these
deep-water divers are
taking the risk a diver
with sense will work
in shoal water and meet
with just as great suc-
cess. A Jap at Darwin
recently, speaking of
deep-water diving in
the Torres Strait, re-
marked that he had
dived at Broome and in
the Strait, but he would
work Broome and Dar-
win in preference to
Torres Strait. If the
pearlers of the Strait
would seek f r e s h
grounds in shallow
water, deep-water div-
ing would attract little
attention. Last year I
saw several lugg-.’is
with Jap divers woi'K-
ing near the Goulbourn
Islands on the N.T.
coast. They went no
deeper than 15 fath-
oms and were getting
good shell, with an occasional healthy pearl.

“8.0’C.”: Camping on the Shoalhaven
(N.S.W.) we shot a splendidly-furred rock-wallaby,
which was duly pelted and the skin pegged out on
the ground to dry. Coming back to camp that
afternoon we found only pegs where the dried skin
should have been, but clinging to a near-by tree
was an old goanna with his stomach distended like
a balloon at the Artists’ ball. I shot him, and
exploring in his garbagc=tin found the wallaby skin
rolled up in a tight ball, but quite unharmed. It
was again pegged down, and this time dried out
perfectly.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: Let me advance the claims of
the lady-bird as our most
useful insect. As a de-
stroyer of pests this little
Australian is known in
many parts of the world
to which it has been im-
ported to fight scale insects
and aphis. By chance a
“bird” was found eating
scale on an Adelaide
orange-tree. This was her
start on a journey round
the world on a career of
usefulness. Maoriland, Cali-
fornia, Sandwich Islands,
Egypt, S’Africa, India and
Portugal were all visited
by scale pests whose depre-
dations were only checked
when the Australian native
was let loose among them.
The first attempt was not
always successful, as the
wrong kind of “lady” was
sent, each variety having
its own particular kind of
food. For instance, some
eat aphis, and the one
that chews cottony cushion
scale will turn up its spots
if offered eucalyptus ditto.
How about raising a
variety to tac-kle the
National Debt?
“The Jumper”: Tell “D.S.” (B. 14/S/’24)
not to argue with her old man, because he’s right.
It is a mug of a man as well as a poor rider who
would allow himself to be pulled out of a saddle
by a kangaroo. In fact, I’ve never previously heard
of such an incident, and I’Ve hunted the Too since
I was 10, both on horseback and on foot. I know
of several instances, however, in which men were
scruffed by old-man ’roos, but the men without
exception were town-bred amateur sports and new-
chums. Although powerful, the strongest kangaroo
could hardly pull a man out of the saddle —he
would have to fall out.

“Chant Pagan” : “P.P.’s” friends go shear-
ing with a motor-car and a gramophbne (B.
17/7/’24). But has anyone yet seen in Australia a
shearing outfit with a wireless receiving set? As
I write this, in Maoriland, miles away from any-
where, I am listening to grand opera broadcasted
from 2FC, Sydney. Can you beat it? It would
surely make some of the old-timers cry “lehabod.”
When motor-cars first started I prophesied that more
people would live in the country and use them for

going to town, but, the reverse seems to have
happened—there is a bigger drift to the towns
than eve.-. And it is falling out the same way vith
wireless. Almost every other back yard in the
towns seems to have a wireless in it; but Mr. Cocky
and Squatter, Esq., appear hardly to have heard of
it yet.
* * * *
“8.5. A.”: Dingo bitches sometimes have
a fascinating way with them. Last year one at
Bagdelup (W.A.) attracted several of the settlers’
dogs away from home. Kangaroo dogs, sheep dog's
and cattle dogs all fell victims to her charms, and
wnile with her assisted in sheep- and lamb-destroying
raids. Five of the dogs she had vamped were killed
with guns and baits, but the lady escaped for
months, her cunning being astounding.
* * * *
“Alawoona”: Tell “Kowsara,” who wants
some sheep-dog prices (B. 28/8/’24), that Wamper
w#s sold by T. White (Vic.) for 150 guineas;
Lanarkshire San cost over £3OO, and it is chronicled
that Champiop Emerald was bought by Mr. Megson
for £l3OO and afterwards sold at a profit to go
to America.
• • * *
“Herodot” : Many stockmen will not have
a stockwhip-handle made of wood, because, if
thrown, the user might impale himself on it. Years
ago a grazier of Wee Waa (N.S.W.) had a whip with
a carved wooden handle, of which he was very proud.
One day his horse shied and threw him, and he
must have fallen straight on to the handle, for
when his body was found a day or so later it was
discovered that the wood had penetrated the lower
portion of his stomach, injuring him horribly.
Leather is the favorite material.
* * * *
“Nitric”: I’m with “Bouragi” (B. 4/9/'24)
when hq says bandicoots do eat sweet potatoes. In
the cane country about Childers and Bundaberg (Q.)
the bandicoots flourished exceedingly, and our main
method of catching them was by trapping with a
sweet-spud bait. There was another method of
reducing the pests. After the cane cutting, the
“trash” was burnt off, or occasionally a field was
burnt off to expedite the cutting, trash being a
great impediment. While this was going on, Tie
village dogs would be held in wait, their masters
armed with nulla-nullas. The slaughter was always
great as bandicoots, kangaroo-rats, snakes and occa-
sionally wild porkers fled before the fire. Still,
that was 20 years ago, and the ’coot may have
changed his diet. Though some species are insect-
ivorous, others have always been recognised biologi-
cally as omnivorous.
* * * *
“The Apostle” : Talking about queer res-
cues and escapes. 1 was with a survey party on
one of the North Queensland rivers when this hap-
pened. We were travelling on a small steam launch,
the Lizzie M., now in Rose Bay (Sydney). 1 had the
wheel ; but instead of watching my course I was look-
ing on at a real good game of poker. Suddenly tne
launch ran aground on a mudbank. The natural
thing and the easiest was for a couple of us to
jump over and push her off; but on looking over
the side we noticed eight big alligators asleep right
in front of the nose of the boat, about 10 feet
away. I can tell you I felt about as happy as Sandy
McDuff was when forced to shout for all hands.
But the old skipper knew his job. He simply gave
three short blasts with the steam whistle, and with
one accord the eight ’gators rushed for the water.
Such a bulk going into the stream raised it a
couple of feet and took us off, and away we went
quite casual.
* * * *
“Borom”: A recent par. concerning
archaic English names of animals recalls two more
which have been out of general use for many years.
One is “twagger,” a lamb; the other, “twinter,” a
sheep or young bullock two years old. Unusual as it
is, I have heard the latter word used by a farmer
in one of the out-back districts of Victoria. When
l asked him where he got it, ;he told me that his
father sometimes employed it, and that in the part of
England whence the latter came it was in general
use. “Twagger” is to be found in several documents
dealing with early Australia, but few would recog-
nise it nowadays.
* • • *
“Herodot” : Coming through some rabbit-
infested country on a clear moonlight night recently
a friend and i noticed a number of rabbits in a
cleared space and stopped to watch them. They were
ranged in a circle round two who seemed to be
performing a dance. Rising on their hind legs, they
would pirouette and turn opposite to each other for
a minute or so, and then pause before resuming the
performance, into which they frequently introduced
new evolutions. After about five minutes they
were joined by one of the spectators, whereupon the
trio continued their gyrations until, unfortunately,
one of us made a slight noise, and they all disappeared
irtto the bush. (There was no warren in the space
when we examined it.) I have often heard of hares
dancing with their own shadows at night, but this
i< the only instance 1 know of rabbits taking to
jazz.
“Conger”: There is a nasty streak in the
tamest bull's character that will make him unreliable
at a moment’s notice. Ayrshires are particularly
noted for it. Many a farmer, after making almost
a household pet of some bull for years, lias had the
beast turn on him without warning. A case like
this shocked Tenterfield (N.S.W.) some time bars.
A farmer was very much attached to a particularly
docile bull, which th'e children had played with for
years. Eventually the animal was sold, but the
farmer, becoming sorry, immediately bought him
back again, giving £lO over the purchase money.
One morning a little later he was walking back from
the paddock gate with the daily newspaper, when
he noticed the bull standing quietly a little distance
off. He waved the paper in jovial greeting, and on
the instant the beast charged and gored him to
death.
* * * *
“F. Clinton”: Green timber is one of the
best assets of the man who is out to cope with
the fly pest in sheep, and is particularly valuable
when found on the banks of streams. In hot weather
the flies seek the shade of the trees, where they
congregate in millions, and leave the sheep alone,
even though the latter are close handy. Yet year
after year hundreds of thousands of acres of bush
are given over to the axe and the firestick. A
knowledge of the value of timber in averting drought,
preventing erosion and easing the burden of the fly
pest is beginning to dawn on the more enlightened
pastoralists, many of whom have planted shelter
belts in their paddocks. The pity of it is that
even where clearing Ts wicked waste the N.S.W.
Lands Department regards it as an “improvement”
on Crown leases.
* * * *
“Bobbo”: There is an agitation in Maori-
land for the abolition of the protection on red deer,
which in several districts, and especially the Waira-
rapa, has increased and multiplied to such an extent
as to become a pest to the farmer. They were originally
imported for sporting purposes, but what was to be
a rich man’s pastime seems likely to become the

sport of anyone who can climb the ranges an-i
handle a gun. Like all importations to Maoriland,
the deer has thriven exceedingly in his new land,
and many a magnificent ten- or twelve-pointer now
adorns the homes of country settlers, while sufficient
remain at large to keep enthusiasts busy for years
to come.
THE AWAKENING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It’s plain a change of season’s near,
There’s portent of the poet’s Spring ;
The black-faced cuckoo-shrike I hear,
The red-rumped tit begins to sing.
The pied grallina quecrlv acts,
The spangled drongo seeks a worm—
These varied scientific facts
My opening remarks confirm.
The shy macropus swiftly thuds
About the flats that line the streams,
And here and there, with old-gold buds,
Acacia dealbata gleams.
The lepidoptera emerge
And test the correas near by;
Coretlira plumicornis surge
Beneath the cirro-cumuli.
Then, in the still nocturnal hour,
The phalangistida make love,
Whilst, from a casuarina bower,
A ninox boobook calls above.
By aves, fauna, flora, flood,
It’s plainly seen, on every hand,
There’s something stirring in the blood,
There's something doing in the land.

RITA MOYA discourses on
NATURAL BEAUTY
and how to obtain it.
Good Shampoo Important. —The hair
should be allowed to breathe, and the
.creasy film around each strand must be re-
moved with a mild non-alkaline shampoo.
Soaps should be tabooed. The very best
solution for the purpose can be made by
dissolving a teaspoonful of stallax granules
in a cup of hot water. It stimulates the
scalp to healthy action, and at the same
time leaves the hair in that soft, fluffy con-
dition so much admired. Any chemist can
supply you with an original packet of stal-
lax, sufficient to make 25 to 30 shampoos.
Magic for Superfluous Hair. —lt is
astounding the number of women who suf-
fer from unsightly growths of hair on the
face, and it will come as a piece of good
news to know that there is a simple sub-
stance known as powdered pheminol
which will remove it immediately. Mix
a small quantity into a thin paste
with a little water, and apply to the objec-
tionable growths. In two minutes all trace
of the hair will have entirely vanished, and
your skin will be as soft and smooth as a
child’s. Pheminol is also invaluable for re-
moving hair from the underarms.
To have Smooth, White Skin all
through the Year. —Does your skin chap
or roughen easily, or become unduly red
or blotchy? Let me tell you a quick and
easy way to overcome the trouble and keep
your complexion beautifully white, smooth
and soft. Just get some pure mercolized
wax at the chemist’s, and use a little before
retiring as you would use cold cream. The
■wax, through some peculiar action, pain-
lessly- flecks, off the rough, discolored or
blemished skin. The worn-out cuticle comes
off just like dandruff on a diseased scalp,
only in almost invisible particles. Merco-
lized wax simply hastens Nature's work,
which is the rational and proper way to
attain a perfect complexion, so much sought
after. The process is perfectly simple and
quite harmless.
For Dry, Irritating and Dandruffy
Scalps. —Nothing can compare with the
following recipe for the above condition, and
until you have rectified any trouble in this
direction it is useless to expect the hair to
grow healthy and vigorous. Mix a package
of boranium with i-pint of bay rum, shake
the bottle well and allow to stand for 30
minutes, then add -}-pint cold water and
strain. This simple home remedy will
stimulate the hair-roots to their normal
functions.
Rouge Not Necessary. — lf you must
add a little color to the cheeks please do
not use rouge; it is always so painfully
obvious that women of refinement have now
discarded it for ever. There is a splen-
did substance called colliandum obtain-
able at most chemist’s, which can be used in
its place. It gives a perfectly natural tint
and defies the closest scrutiny, besides hav-
ing the undoubted advantage of not rubbing
off.
The Powder Puff Passes. —A persist-
ently shiny nose, or a dull, lifeless com-
plexion drives many a woman to cosmetics
and consequently despair. And all the
time a simple remedy is obtainable. Get
from your chemist a package of clemin-
ite. and add sufficient water to dissolve it.
A little of this simple lotion is Nature’s own
beautifier. It is very good for the skin and
instantly gives the complexion a soft, vel-
vety. youthful bloom that any woman might
envy. It lasts all day or evening, renders
powdering entirely unnecessary, and abso-
lutely defies detection.
Miscellaneous Hints. —For lips inclined
to be rough or harsh use a soft stick of
prolaetum. An ideal complexion soap is
one called pilenta. It contains no free alkali,
and is as near neutrality as science can make
it.
To make the eyelashes grow loner, dark
and curling, massage them gently with
mennalme. It is quite a harmless substance,
and will not injure the eyes.

The Grand Opera Co.’s postponed gala
night in aid of the Limbless Soldiers is due
to be held in Ilis Majesty's next Monday, Oct-
ber 6), Melba permitting; “The Lady of the
Rose” will cease to bloom for one night to
permit the special programme to be pre-
sented. Well over £12,000 has already been
raked in by donations and sales of seats. In
some quarters there is a feeling of soreness
at what is regarded as the offhandedness in
which the event has been postponed. But
Melba’s illness was certainly serious, and
there would have been greater soreness had
the show been held without her.
The Alfred Hospital went more or less off
duty for a couple of hours on a recent after-
noon to welcome a more joyous type of
gathering than is usually inside its iodoform-
scented walls. White-clothed tables, gayly
centred with Spring flowers, and a piano
tinkling from an impromptu platform, livened
the place out of recognition for the yearly
meeting of the Institute’s auxiliaries.
General Brudenell White understudied the
absentee president Henry Collins. Busi-
ness resolved itself into a fierce bombard-
ment of verbal bouquets. General White
threw another sort of bomb, however, at
the young person who jazzes and leaves her
ciders to shoulder charitable obligations. Bob
Chisholm was the headlight of a musical
menu, provided by Mrs. Barry Thompson,
which brightened the subsequent tea drinking.
A feature of the Art Students’ Ball which
crowded the St. Kilda Town Hall, and dis-
turbed the night echoes of Melbourne’s jazz
suburb until 5 a.m. last Saturday, was com-
posed of supercilious onlookers who claimed
to have attended an Artists’ Ball at a place
called Sydney, and drew comparisons which
made the Art Students’ affair seem tame.
One of the local youths, irritated by the in-
ference that the affair was not up to the
Sydney standard, volunteered to show the
scoffers a lady performer whose condition
was approaching ripeness; but his oue ex-
hibit was disallowed, and the 10 policemen
who had been told off to keep the riotous
Bohemians in order' had nothing to do but
wonder when the committeee would remem-
ber they had mouths on them. For all that
it was a glad affair in which a number of
theatricals participated.
Mrs. Andrew McHarg. who is sheltering
a bazaar in her Armadale home shortly to
cover the cost of renovating an East Mel-
bourne Foundling Hospital ward, conceived
the bright notion of inviting her intimates
to help stock the fancy-goods section with
home-made articles compiled from a half-
crown’s worth of material. Those who had
answered the call were invited to unpack tin-
goods at a tea-drinking in the McHarg par-
lors on Friday afternoon, when cut-glass
decanters of scent would be awarded to the
two best efforts, the awards being made by
popular vote. After a breathless inspection
the medical Lawrences’ daughters Beryl and
Jean divided the honors. The former
romped in an easy first with two-and-six
worth of bahy’s muslin robe, weighted with
about a pound’s worth of handwork. As a
result of the competition, a ton or less of
woollies, filmy undies and an infinite variety
of other desirable articles will help to make
the bazaar a paying proposition.
Overseas medicoes have condemned tire
muge-pot and the lip-stick as the inanimate
Borgias of modern society. Now local
authorities accuse the powder-puff of distri-
buting “hay fever.” The pollen of flowers used
to be the suspects, and one well-known Mel-
bourne man of 20 years ago never accepted a
dinner invitation unless he knew his hostess
well enough to weight his acceptance with
rhe condition; “No cosmos.” Nowadays he
would have to refuse every invitation, know-
ing that not even the most obliging hostess
can guarantee him against the sly powdering
of feminine noses between courses.
Isabel Allard, the Brighton girl who red-
lettered a recent Ceylon jaunt by engaging
herself to Naval Loot Lionel Leefe, returned
to the city of ravens and ’rickshaws last
month to seal the contract, under convoy of
her mother. Anne Willis went to ’maid the
bride. An overseas coo-ee now mentions
that the ceremony was carried out with the
pomp and circumstance befitting a ’groom
who gent.-helps vice-royalty. Governor Wil-
liam Manning and his dame gave their
patronage, and lent the staff humpy at
Newari Eliya for the ’moon. Uncle Basil
Leefe led in the bride, dad being anchored
here by business. A lace veil misted the
bridal frock, which had a blush-pink lining ,
the brocaded backwash had a froth of snowy
feathers, with pearls and blossoms on the
lower section. Two small boys in blue satin
trousers and white silk shirts combined to
look after the silken tail. The bridesmaid
lluttered filmy blue, with mauve and blue
leaves encircling the crown, and trickling
over one shoulder.
Congratulations have been flying round
the Sun office, art-editor Reginald Knowles-
Kempton standing self-convicted of contem-
plated matrimony with little Peggy Manser,
elder daughter of the W. E. Manser widow,
of St. lvilda, and grand-daughter of Mrs.
Agar Wynne. The romance budded in the
Sun office, where the girl fluttered briefly
across the Inky Way. Her late father was
a sapper major who spent some years in Aus-
tralia as an exchange officer. He died early
in the war, leaving his widow with two
young daughters and a small Aussie-born
son. Reginald is the son of a Maonland
cleric.
An umbrella that has retained its original
cover for over 150 years, shedding only the
cord and tassel, has been traced to Hobart.
It was purchased in or before 1770, by Wil-
liam Clewett, a Dorset man, whose great-
granddaughter took it to Hobart, where it
is now in her son’s care. They simply icon t
stay in one family like that in Melbourne.
The Austral Salon will rise from its ashes
in Hardware Chambers in a much more
dressy form. This was the news broad-
casted at the sliivoo in the Independent Hall
which served to welcome the Salon presi-
dent, the Madden dame, after her English
jaunt, and to kiss good-bye to little Pauline
Bindley, who is packing her songs and
make-up box to join Harry Lauder's com-
pany in a tour of eastern Asia.
Our friend Sing On, who makes up for
serving us with shortweight vegetables all
the year by a. present of a pot of insanitary
ginger at Christmas, waxes daily more hilari-
ous about this new Mali Jong fashion of
wearing feminine fripperies peppered with
Chinese characters. If the ladies had them
translated, he says, some would get the shock
of their lives. One “ ’olio missic,’ who
happens to be a spinster, in addition to East
Wind, Long Life, Prosperity and sundry
prepositions and conjunctions, has the ideo-
graph for “Many Children” prominently dis-
played.
The winter is officially dead as far as the
considerable body of Melbourne ice-skaters
is concerned. As a preliminary to banging
its doors until next May, the Glaciarium held
a carnival, some fetching costumes figuring
amongst the fancy-dresses. The dress prize
was won by a lady garbed in a scheme of
white at the bows, and green aft. Guess it?
Of course —“If Winter comes can Spring be
far behind?”
The grave eyes looking at you from this
picture belong to Dulcie Christian, the
Northcote girl whose talent as a recitress
has carried her
to the front
line of our
local elocution-
ary ranks. Her
sense of the
dramatic re-
vealed itself
when, as a
tiny child, she
lisped “H o w
Doth the Little
Busy Bee,”
and suchlike
nursery clas-
sics. In her
top-drawer are
a whole shoal
of medals and
;ertificates won
at competi-
tions all over
the State. Rosa
Dunn put the
polish on Dul-
cie’s elocutionary talent. T.ast week the re-
citress vowed herself away to Ernest II ell wig,
eldest son of a Geelong- resident who mi-
grated to the newly-awakened city from
Northcote.
Another of the lucky Gaunt family, Lance-
lot, is now making himself heard on the
other side, where he will try to join his
brother, Admiral Guy, in the Commons as
member for North Hull. Lance, who was
known to his boyhood’s friends as Dolly, is
the youngest of the late Judge Gaunt’s bril-
liant offspring and sister of the novelist. For
some years he has been a legal light in
tropical Singapore. Ilis wife is a sister of
the late “Chinese” Morrison.
Laura de Nully dropped only part of her
maiden name when she became Mrs. Albert
de Fegley in the Deniliquin Anglican Church
the other day. Her dad, who manages the
local branch of the E., S. and A. Bank,
handed her over, while sister Marie cheered
her. Bob Richardson, who is a near neigh-
bor of the De Fegleys at Ararat, best-manned
the ’groom. Antique lace which has veiled
several generations of De Nully brides
foamed above blush pink silk, which parted
in the middle over silver lace. Nina dc
Fegley, in the absence through sickness of
the baronial pa and ma, encouraged her
bridegroom brother.
This bright little girl, Myrtle Wise, is the
'Varsity Con. student who stirred the critics
to applause by the brilliance of her coloratura
soprano an d
her dramatic
artistry at the
Corn's recent
opera night in
the Melba
Hall, when she
sang and acted
the scena and
Shadow Song
from “Din-
orah.” When
she was 17
certain experts
suggested that
singing was
not her metier.
F ort unately
Sobell thought
differently, and
undertook to
provei within
a year that he
knew a song-
bird when he
heard it. A good scholar and a keen sport
in her Toorak college days, Myrtle is one
of the best-liked damsels in Society’s younger
set.
It was a rough, Diggerish remark which
dissipated the civilian restraint that sat
heavily upon the early part of the annual
reunion of the Fourth Light Horse at Anzac
House last Friday. As usual, the comrades
who had gathered were unable altogether to
restore the atmosphere of camp-fire days;
and it was quite in keeping that Colonel \Y.
M. Bourchier (now an M.P.) should refer
to the old 4th A.L.H. as a tribe of angels.
Good discipline was always maintained, lie
declared, and lie could not remember having
ever given any man “C. 8.” “You’ve lost
your blanky memory!” someone interjected.
Out of the laughter that followed voices
could be heard calling their neighbors, in a 1
perfectly friendly fashion, by the old bad
names; and genial good-fellowship at once
fell upon the gathering.
William Bowring, a merchant who passed ,
out in July, has left £5OO (1 per cent, of
liis £50,000 estate) to S. J. Iloban, the pliil- .
anthropic Methody parson, with which to .
start a fund for building his proposed hostel
for girls in Melbourne. Hoban’s idea is
that, given a “homey” place where board
and lodging could be obtained at a reason-
able rate, and where decent pals and recrea-
tion would be found, there would be a chance .
of checking the drift which loneliness, ,
gloomy rooms and vinegary landladies help
to start. |
Comes news from overseas of Naval Com-
mander Fearce Foster’s appointment to the .
Whitehead, one of the up-to-datest destroy- .
ers attached to the Mediterannean Fleet.
The popular Pearce Foster was lent to our
own little navy after the war; lie married
Marjorie Sandford, whose Brigadier-General
dad was commanding the Port Phillip de-
fences when the war-drums first beat. Mar-
jorie and her boy babe are going to Malta
at the end of October.
From the Far-Far North: —
The Hon. Mrs. Pitt Rivers has received a mountain
of compliments in her joyous career, but I pass on
one that overtops them all. My black coon, whom
I had always thought the dullest and most thick-
headed native in Rabaul, was responsible. He had
been to the “sing-sing” given to the G.-G., and woke
me up to tell me he had seen “Alary all-same sun.”
As this was a speech three words longer than he
had ever before made to me, I sat up and took notice;
but elaborate gesticulation and the exhaustion of my
pidgin English left liis meaning still unrevealed.
After the manner of the place I took my retainer
with me to the ball next evening. Then all was
made plain—the lady’s appearance at the sing-sing
had caused the poetic outburst, and her evening-
decoration brought a repetition of it. But, alas! it
was her “lava-lava” that had evoked the enthusiasm.
Her face my black thickhead couldn’t see for the
magnificence of her dress.
A woman of these parts visiting the U.S.A.
writes home of how she put Australia on
the map at Spokane, in Washington County.
“I was being entertained at a cousin’s house
one afternoon, and, finding my fellow-guests
did not seem to know anything of my coun-
try, I warmed up, with the result that I
held the floor for the rest of the afternoon.
Next morning I had an early caller, the local
parson. His wife had been at the party; she
had told him of my discourse. Would I
repeat it in his pulpit one evening?” And
she did.
The Toorak George Gatehouses have just
said 4 “Bless you, my children,” to their
younger daughter, Beryl, and Stephen Samp-
son, the Elsternwick admirer who has won
her smile. The popular bride-elect is a sister
of that bright young mummer, “Frank
[ Allanby,” who starred as juvenile lead witli
: Marie Tempest. Her parents hail from
Tassic.
. Charlie Jackson, a popular member of the
Kodak staff, is unsuccessfully trying not
to look bucked about having persuaded
pretty little Phyllis Dawson to make him
happy some time in this coming year.
Charles was one of a trio of brothers who
helped to keep the flag flying on the battle-
front. All three returned to their native
Aussie on the casualty list, he on the more
serious side of it.
The Queen Victoria and Children's Hospi-
tals have lost a valuable friend in Mrs.
.Tames Murphy, who passed away at her
home at Mornington. She was a daughter
of Alex. Balcombe, a pioneer sheepgrower on
the Mornington peninsula, who was born at
St. Helena when Nap. was a prisoner there.
Gladys Wertheim and Bill Fanning have
just got on to the engaged list, and are still
under a heavy fire of congratulations. Bill
and his elder brother, Rupert, put up
fine records in the Great War. They are
sons of Mrs. and the late Ted Fanning.
Gladys is the younger daughter of the Hugo
Wertheim widow.
Another of Toorak’s boom-time palaces.
Ulawarra, has been put on the auction
block, and the hammer fell to the low bid
of six thousand five hundred. The purchaser.
.T. P. Churton, intends to carve the roomy
dwelling into flats. It was built by C. H.
James, a glittering product of the Mel-
bourne land-boom, who died when the bubble
burst.
Adelaide forgives the Dame:—
First it was “No guarantees, no opera” ; then
“Opera, but no Me; then, “Maybe I’ll tome and look
at it”; finally capitulation and “La Bolieme." Adel-
aide has forgotten all its earlier irritation in the
joy of opera every night of the week, and even gave
Melba a burst of applause all to herself when she
turned up in the Bridges’ box on Wednesday and
threw her bouquet down to Concato at the end of the
second act of “Butterfly.” Toti dal Monte and
Scavizzi established themselves as old friends after
tho first couple of nights, and divide their time on
their “off” nights between the vice-regal and mana-
gerial boxes—Scavizzi usually with an ermine wrap
about her shoulders (the theatre is arctic, and
Melba was reduced to reinforcing her own voluminous
furs with the box curtain), and Dal Monte in dashing
cherry-color. Adelaide, which is as likely to take its
theatre in tweeds and a burberry as in anything else,
has brushed itself up for the occasion, and stalls
and circle fairly shimmer with starched shirt-fronts
and! the rainbow colors of women’s dresses.
The Girls’ Orphanage at Mitcham is to get the
cheque from a Bridge evening staged at the Sydney
Reids' home on South-terrace, and £7B goes to
London for Ilclene Taylor from Mrs. Wesley Lathlean’s
big effort in the Town Hall —some of it earmarked
to give the songstress a fortnight’s holiday in Paris.
The committee for the Blue Triangle Fete has pub-
lished its balance-sheet, and announces a useful profit
of over £250.
Ex-Governor Galway, who is in Central America oj
a railway-construction mission, writes wonderful
accounts of the cash to be picked up in that out-of-
the-way corner of the world. Ten per cent, is bar.i:-
interest rate in Colombia, and 6 per cent, is the
lowest paid by Savings Banks: the country abounds
in nearly everything from good coffee to fat cattle :
there are emeralds and coal, and silver, and man-
ganese and platinum ; and roses and violets abloom
all the year. It sounds like Paradise. But if they
pay 10 per cent, for bank deposits, what should v.c
have to pay for the overdraft that we’d simply have
to get to buy all the prizes with?
The week has seen a couple of mayoral receptions
—one to the feminine belongings of the delegates
to the Y.M.C.A. Congress and the other with Airs. R.
V. Wilson as its chief guest—she has been with her
Federal Minister to Wembley—and an array of M’s.P.
and city councillors’ wives to meet her. The V.
Emmas were specially privileged to see the Town
Hall’s collection of historic mementoes, most of them
more or less concerned with Queen Adelaide.
Prince Alfred College sent 860 old boys to the
war, and 116 of them never returned. These it has
commemorated in a new building, which pretty well
doubles the size of the one the Duke of Edinburgh
opened nearly 60 years ago. Besides the usual Rolls
of Honor, it is to contain two tine memorial windows.
Adelaide Conservatorium has imported another
teacher of singing, Clive Carey,, a pupil of Jean !e
Reszke. He is a baritone, with wide experience
at the Old Vic. in London, and with a concert
party, “The English Singers,” Gerald Cooper, the
Australian pianist, being the co.’s accompanist. Since
the war he has been with the Royal College of Music,
London, and has written the incidental music for
one or two plays.
Scotch College has been so successful since taking
over the old Barr Smith mansion at Torrens Park
that it has had to erect a new wing. The Governor
opened it.
The Cheer-up Hut is to be vacated at last, the
Railways requiring the space. The hut owed its
origin to a complaint in October, 1914, that nothing
was being done for the reinforcements flocking into
the local camps. On which a host of energetic women
got together, and right through the war and for
years after it looked after every soldier who camped
near the city, or passed through it on the way to
France, or returned on his way to the eastern States.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
SILK
STOCKINGS
The Governor and Lady de Chair are ex-
pecting small daughter Enid and smaller son
Somerset at the end of November. The two
youngsters left England in the Themistocles,
but stepped off at Capetown to spend a holi-
day with an adoring grandmother—her Ex.’s
mother.
The Royal Colonial Institute, on which the
Union Club opposite turns an austere eye,
was radiant as for a wedding. A stream of
crimson carpet flushed from its lower halls
to the edge of the pavement. Limousines
drew up and deposited overdraftish-looking
men and wliite-gloved women. And still the
air of expectancy that brooded over the street
and its army of asphalt-layers was unbroken.
But about 4 o’clock the Institute’s great
moment arrived, and the State Excellencies
entered its doorway for the first time; Lady
de Chair very graceful in black velvet, with
fitch furs, the whole finished off by a black
hat of Romney architecture. Upstairs in
the reception-rooms the atmosphere was as
buoyant as a sad scone. The lucky people
were those who had secured a seat early ; the
elogantly-late arrivals secured a foothold
where opportunity offered. A few old cam-
paigners even leaned against the grand piano,
looking like studio pictures of John McCor-
mack or Alba Rosa —to be presently chivvied
from that support by pianist Myrtle Meggy
and singer Francis Halls. Acting-president
Alfred Meeks and his lady did the honors,
she supported by ermine wraps and attrac-
tive mauve millinery; and the Kelso Kings
and Beulah Bolton wore their best welcome-
stranger smiles at the doorway. The Hughes
lady, Mrs. Hedley Hardman and artist B. E.
Minus’s wife added notable frocking to the
gathering; the convalescent Mrs. Roystone
Davey had with her Admiral Clarkson’s lady ;
and all the institute’s available pillars, plain
and titled, were in evidence.
The lift at the Women’s Club wasn’t over-
worked taking enthusiasts to the meeting of
the Domestic Immigration Society on Thurs-
day. In fact, the meeting might be described
as a wilderness of room, with here and there
a human oasis. However, as the clarion call
had gone out to similar associations, such as
the new Settlers’ League, asking their co-
operation in establishing a hostel for the
accommodation of migrants, a great roll-
up of the general public wasn’t indispensable.
The McMillan lady, Mrs. Macdonald and
Mrs. Richard Sly were at the helm, and such
pioneers as Mrs. Aronson, Mrs. Storie Dixson
and Miss Fourdrinier added to the general
purr of agreement. But as woman to woman,
if a little of this consideration and back-
stroking had been applied years ago to Aus-
tralian lasses, would it have been necessary
to send the SOS from John o’ Groats to
Land’s End for help to exercise the vacuum
and the mop in the Australian home?
This Letter knows a little girl who refuses
to acknowledge the existence of Cows. In
real life she ignores them; when they occur
in a picture-book she turns the page rapidly,
and if the name arises in the telling of a
story she interjects: “Let’s call it a pussy.”
For years the Women’s Club adopted a simi-
lar attitude with regard to man. As a body
it ignored him. In only one corner of the
dining-room, and that behind a screen, could
you feed the brute; and the assembly-rooms
were never violated by his shoe-leather. But
time changes all. With the letting of the
club rooms to such flipperty-gipperty insti-
tutions as the Repertory Society and the
Victorian League, Man has entered into the
Eves’ paradise. He did it in fair numbers
on Friday last, when Mrs. Arthur Eedy host-
essed the society’s monthly “afternoon.”
And when that Apollo who plays lead in
“Liliom” strode into the room, a sigh of
admiration like a furnace-blast blistered the
rosewood finish of the baby grand.
The A.I.F. Wives and Children’s Holiday
Association held its sixth annual meeting
at the seaside home, Furlough House, on
Saturday afternoon. The weather registered
fair and warmer,” and cohorts descended
per chariot and tram on the Narrabeen tryst.
The Governor’s lady presided at the meet-
ing. held in the pleasant common room,
which was full of the breath of boronia
and sweet-peas. Premier George Fuller’s
wife, who is president of the society,
handled the business in a capable fashion,
Matron Fowle provided tea; and such en-
thusiasts as Judge Hamilton, Alderman
Heaton, Dr. Constance D’Arcy and the Eng-
land couple added cheeriness to the assembly.
The sensation of the Society of Artists’
smoke-o on Saturday evening was the re-
served long table at the top of the room, im-
mediately below the platform. “Aha,” said
the clever ones, “the Council has a surprise
for us! Some notables in Art and Litera-
ture will adorn the top board, while the
smaller fry below the salt, as it were,
get an eye-full of genius.” Expectation rose
on tiptoe as the minutes went by, only to
smash into a thousand pieces when the sur-
vivors of the Cavalier Club entered and
seated themselves in aloof grandeur. Hardly
one of those grouped about the president of
the society, Syd Smith, had any connection
with painting. The set-apart table may,
however, have been the symbolic red rope
of vice-royalty, as Captain Pitt Rivers and
Captain Lawrence had their little porringers
there. In fact, there was a breathless moment
when it wasn’t quite decided whether Pitt
Rivers, being a son-in-law of the G.-G.,
wasn’t entitled to be heralded with “God
Save” ! Others among the elect were Mrs.
Sidney Jamieson, daughter Anne, Mrs.
Jimmie Burns (who wore her diamonds)
and Philip Morton. For the rest the gather-
ing went its usual jolly way. In spite of
the deluge. Art and his wife turned up in
great numbers.
And this is the story:—
When Grand Opera was in its early weeks, Harry
Julius received a telephone call early one Monday
morning.
“Ah, you-a are Mistair Julius—is it not?”
Harry: “Yes, that’s right.”
Voice: “It ees Borgioli—the tenor with the Gcr-
rand Op-e-ra.”
Harry: “Yes?”
Voice: “You are the garigaturist, is it not? An
you make the garigature of me on Saturday at the
op-e-ra?”
Harry: “That’s so.”
Voice: “Well, Mistair Julius, I should be ver-ry
pleased to see that garigature beforre you sind-a it
in to the Bulleteen? Will you per-raps have loonch
with me and Signora Borgioli and let uz see?”
Harry: “Yes, I’ll do that.”
Voice: “You aro a liar, Harry Julius. You will
not loonch with Borgioli. It is I, Dattilo ltubbo,
who pool your leg!”
The death of Arthur Schute, of the wool-
broking firm of Schute, Bell and Co., hap-
pened with tragic suddenness on Friday
evening. He was knocked down by a motor-
car near the Rose Bay Golf Club-lioiise,
where he had been staying during alterations
to the family home at Woollalira, Mrs. Schute
and daughter Audrey meanwhile putting up
at a Darlinghurst boarding-house. Audrey,
who is one of Sydney’s best jazzers, was at
a dance when the news was brought to her,
and poor Mrs. Schute was out playing bridge.
Mr. Schute’s father was a Bradford wool-
man, and the son got his early training in
Yorkshire, coming to Australia to enter
Goldsbrough, Mort’s. About 18 years ago
he founded the present company, and has
served his clients faithfully. An expert wool-
man, a keen sport, universally liked, he was
68 when he died.
It is Dorothy Ewbank's purposeful profile
that is recorded here by May Moore’s camera.
The nice-looking girl is one of Sydney’s
cleverest songbirds, and she unleashes her
well - trained
soprano at a
recital in the
King’s Hall
early next
month. A
pupil of Nel-
son Illing-
worth, she
was one of the
first five
s c h olarship-
holders at the
Conserva-
tor i u m
Rosa Alba was
another. At
the end of the
three years
V e r brugghen
thong h t so
highly of her
m u sicianship
that he gave
her a further
two years for her pianoforte work. At her
concert an interesting number will be the
famous Cherry duet from Mascagni’s “Friend
Fritz.” Reginald Morphew will supply the
male notes.
The Mother-General of the Loretto Order
of Nuns (they have schools and training col-
leges throughout the world) is on a visit from
Britain with a staff of three in attendance.
The visitors are to be entertained by the
past and present pupils of the Loretto col-
leges ; one event will be a harbor excursion,
a band in attendance, on October 11. The
senior mother is staying at Normanhurst
Convent, on the heights near Hornsby.
A picturesque wedding was staged during
the week at St. Philip’s, under the manage-
ment of Canon Bellingham, Myrtle Gilder,
of Muswellbrook, and Robert Leigh Dixon,
of Pennant Hills, playing leads. The event
was of the quiet order that didn’t whisper
beyond a circle of family friends, but the
frocking was worthy of loud hallelujahs.
The bride’s, of ivory georgettes, was lustrous
with chenille embossings, and there was a
train of Limerick lace that blushed faintly
over a rosy foundation. Over this cascaded
a tulle veil, moored to a graceful head by
the traditional orange-blossom. Bride’s sis-
ter Marie and ’groom’s sister Lorna ’maided
in the billowy skirts of the modernised early
Victorian, the color scheme being mauve
and silver. The Wentworth spread the wed-
ding meats.
Another wedding of interest to Muswell-
brook took place at St. Mark’s, Alan White,
of Tucka-Tucka, Goondiwindi, son of the Edin-
glassie Whites, of Muswellbrook, entering
into partnership with Dorothy Menzies, of
Roseville.
Here is'May Moore’s picture of a brilliant
and genial personality. Judge Hamilton,
although he reached the N. S. Wales Bench
age-limit the other day, refuses not to be a
Judge. So now
he passes ex-
pert opinion
on china and
roses. He is
president of
the Horticul-
ture Society,
and under his
direction that
perennial
flourishes ex-
ceedingly—the
very flowers
in the subur-
ban gardens
are thrill'd
with the de-
sire not to be
found wan t-
ing. The Judge
is a fluent
raconteur,
and draws
upon his early
days as a barrister of the Inner
Temple for a store of memories of
such giants as Sir Charles Russell, Pope
of the Parliamentary Bar, and a host of old-
time lawyers.
The Jefferson-Coghlan nuptials during the
week united two well-known Sydney fami-
lies. The bride, Joan Jefferson, is a daugh-
ter of the 11. G. Jefferson who is managing-
director of the McArthur Shipping and
Agency Co.; and Elwyn Coglilan, besides
being a director of the Colonial Spinning and
Combing Co., is a son of Dr. Coghlan. K.C..
and a nephew of N. S. Wales Agent-General
Timothy. The bride’s father being ill, the
wedding was staged in the home circle; but
the wedding dress of ivory romain and silver
brocade was worthy of a cathedral and full
choral accompaniment. Marjorie Nettleton
’maided in apricot georgettes that bloomed
here and there into pansy plots; the same
sentimental flower glowed on her bronze
straw hat. Elwyn rose from pilot to captain
in the Royal Flying Corps during the war,
so matrimonial squalls should hold no ter-
rors for him.
Near Kuringai train travellers to New-
castle get an unexpected glimpsd away below
the line of a little pool, a yacht, a coral
tree and a houseboat. This has been for 35
years the home of “Old Bill” Windybanks,
who gave up a lot of land at Mosman and a
boatsiied business to open up Cowan Creek
for picnickers. As the banks there are steep
and mostly Government reserve, he built a
dozen houseboats for the week-ender and the
honeymooner. The other day in the spaci-
ous cabin of his motor-launch, where an im-
provised altar had been erected for the occa-
sion, he handed over his daughter to a local
resident. The Rev. Wade launched the
young craft on the sea of matrimony.
It took Reginald Cobb only four months
from the first meeting to offer his hand and
heart to pretty Barbara Wilkinson, the
daughter of T. V. Wilkinson, of the Bank
of N. S. Wales, Bathurst. Reginald’s dad
has managed the Whites’ show place, Bell-
trees, at Scone, for many years ; and the son
is overseer on Dr. Norman Ivater’s Eena-
weena, Warren. Barbara is Mrs. Norman
Kater’s niece.
Ruth Beale got back to Sydney in time
for brother Harold’s wedding to Dr. Edith
Allard on Tuesday night. Ruth’s fine eyes
are still liquid with the glories of the great
Northern lights and the wonders of the
Yukon. She saw glaciers sapphire-blue and
almost bottle-green; she lived under night
skies that varied from pansy-purple to arctic-
blue, wherein the stars shone with a start-
ling radiance. A most interesting couple
the Sydney woman met were the Yukon
M.P. and his wife, she an exquisite little
person in the fifties with a taste for French
clothes, who has shot the rushing jade-green
waters of the Yukon many a time with her
pioneering husband. Ruth says she nearly
towed home a glacier big enough to build
Sydney on. For it is by no means all in-
convenience to live in a frozen place like
Dawson City. For instance, when the hot
weather comes and the man of the house
wants his champagne iced, all his lady has
to do is to go into the back yard, scratch a
hole and leave the bottle to freeze.
Knight Henry Braddon and his lady
headed a committee of willing workers who
made the Incognitos’ dance at the Ambas-
sadors on Friday one of the successes of
the week. The girls’ frocks were as radiant
and multi-colored as a flight of butterflies,
and the final bloom was dusted on the even-
ing by a picturesque tango staged by Harry
Thomas and pretty June Henry. Premier
George Fuller made one of his rare social
appearances, and seemed to enjoy it; his lady
was very handsome in white crepe weighted
with crystal embroideries.
The Sydney Hospital nurses had a night
to make their own pulses race and tempera-
tures leap on Friday, when they sallied forth
from Macquarie-street for their yearly jazzo.
Sargent’s ballroom, in Market-street, housed
the fun, and handsome Matron Ivellett did
the honors, frocked in a mixture of soft black
satin and old gold.
Marvellous things though it can do, the
player-piano is not the ideal instrument for
accompaniments. This was demonstrated
before singer Emily Marks had finished her
first group of songs at her Saturday-night re-
cital in the King’s Hall. Accompanist Oswald
Anderson juggled with little clutches and
press-buttons at the front of the instrument,
and certainly worked wonders with regard
to light and shade, but it still lacked
sympathy. The songbird warbled in three
tongues, and was particularly effective in
the German group.
The cause of the Children’s Hospital has
been taken into the arms of the business girl.
A few nights ago the workers in Grace
Brothers made the Palais Royal glitter in the
interests of the Camperdown institution, and
the hospital’s secretary, Clarence Moss,
smiled as happily as a Bengal tiger after din-
ner when announcing that the heads of the
Broadway firm were subsidising the gate
money pound for pound.
Dancing-girl Maureen Foster beckoned a
group of her sister YVestralian and Sydney
friends on to the top branches of the Blue
Gum rooms last Friday afternoon for jazz
and tea. Her mother! Mrs. Foster-Mattei,
helped to pass the brew, and later Maori -
land poetess Lilia Gormliuille McKay forsook
the muse, and, taking a reef of the sibyl’s
veil, read the teacups. As everybody was
promised good luck in love and finance, and
lots of fun to go on with, the gathering ended
on a hurrah. Among tbe guests wore Mrs.
Ivingsmill (Perth), with pianist-niece Kath-
leen Fanning, who has forsaken the keyboard
and is now buttressing the Firm’s fortune in
the chorus of “Whirled Into Happiness.”
Poor May Beatty is still in Omrah, and
likely to be there for another two or three
weeks. But she is well enough to vamp the
hospital attendants. Under the stimulus of
her cordial eye one of the fluttering males in-
stalled a wireless crystal set for May’s de-
light, and the patient spends her convales-
cence listening-in.
Brisbane goes to a party:—
Seven hundred pairs of feet crunched the gravel
at Sir Matthew Nathan’s garden party on the 24th.
The weather god was kind, the vice-regal swards and
coppices looked their prettiest, and vari-colored pan-
sies turned their shocked faces on the gaily frocked
invasion. Amongst the other choice flowers were Mrs.
J. L. Wool cock, in violet mauve; Mrs. William
Collins, in black and gold ; Mrs. Robert Thompson, in
grey ; Mrs. Whittingham, in a Paris model of mastic ;
Pamela Nathan, in white ; Mrs. Sligo, in biscuit-color
with emerald hat; Cecily Garrick, in ivory brochc :
Mrs. Theodore, in black mariette; and Mrs. Leonard
Turner, in black and white. Mrs. Turner’s son
A.D.C.’d, and George Nathan, Lieut.-Colonel Durrant
and H. M. Saunders acted as Sir Matthew’s chief
offsiders.
His Ex. went to the Shakspeare Society’s evening
in the Albert Hall, where Barbara Sisley and A. D.
Graham, aided by Mrs. Symes and Nell Douglas
Graham, served up some intellectual dishes.
On their way south the G.-G. and Lady Forster
paid us a flying visit, and in the evening went to hear
H. M. Saunders talk on “Patrols in Papua.” In a
spare hour Lady Forster opened the new creche and
kindergarten in the Valley, and was handed a silver
key, inscribed with her name and the date. Sir
Matthew presided over the annual meeting, just
before the ceremony.
The Brisbane Women’s Club dressed itself up in
gladioli, roses and delphiniums, for its at-home the
other day. Ryders, Trittons, Readings and Sligos
were among the tea drinkers.
Mrs. B. Cowlishaw spread lunch at Lennon’s in
honor of sister Elsie Ferguson’s approaching wedding.
The Ross Philp and E. Wardrop dames, Alice Haw-
thorn, Nell Kerwin, Cecily Waley and Evelyn Horst-
mann were amongst the lunchers.
Sir Matthew, with Mrs. Turner and the Nathans,
went to the jazz and card party given by All Hallows
pupils to help along the Mater Misericordi® public
hospital. Lennon’s ballroom was reserved, and the
main dining-room was dressed up in Iceland poppies
and carnations for the supper. Mrs. Ted Theodore
received the Governor's party.
Margaret, of the Cooneba Deshons, took R. J.
Crothers, of Moorenbah, for better or worse at St.
Stephen’s Cathedral. The high altar burned with
coral-tinted gerberas. Father O’Leary tied the knot,
and the bride was in ivory satin.
Captain and Mrs. E. Nelson Turner, of Tulagi,
British Solomons, flitted through Brisbane en route
for England and the continent via Uncle Sam’s
country.

The Hawkesbury people got an excellent
crowd when the old Clarendon course, now much more
comfortable in the matter of appointments, was
re-opened for business on Saturday; but owners and
trainers of prominent cattle might have treated the
club more generously, and the Railway Department
could hardly have treated it worse. Although three
of the six winners were favorites, McShortodds suffered
no harm. Mont Clair (6’s) atoned for his failure
at Randwick on Sept. 13 by dead-heating with
Glaciarum ( (Vs), a rather smart Cooltrim mare, in
the six-furlongs Highweight Handicap ; and Mountain
Chief (7’s), another chestnut son of Mountain King,
was galloping so well at the finish of the Three-
vear-old Handicap, for which Darjeeling was a dis-
appointing favorite, as to suggest that he is the
makings of a good miler. Then the useful Glen
Song (2’s), who has 7st. 41b. in the Metropolitan,
rendered his backers a service by staving off Bala-
ton’s strong challenge in the Hawkesbury Spring
Handicap. The English chestnut came from a long
way back, but weakened over the last bit —or perhaps
it was the jockey who weakened. He is a. very
hard horse to ride. But the most interesting performer
at Clarendon was Feathernest, a fine-looking five-
year-old bay stallion by Featherstitch —Fleet Street,
both imported, who has) done most of his racing in
Westralia. Backed down to 2’s in the Rowley Mile,
he got the worst of the start, but was soon trailing
the leader, Mountbat-

owner of Ballymena.
ten, and once in the
straight he danced
away from Devant
and Mountbatten, be-
hind whom were Col-
laroi, Lexy, Hit, All
Wheat and Janitor.
Feathernest is owned
by Paddy Connolly, a
first-class judge of a
horse, for whom he
won the Ivalgoorlie
Cup, 1-J mile, and ran
third in the Perth Cup,
a two-miler, to Lily-
pond and Char. He has
Bst. in the Epsom and
7st. 121 b. in the Metro-
politan, and the market
suggests that the lat-
ter is his mission.
For one reason and another, Glen train,
The Cypher, Leslie Wallace, Soorak and Shrapnel
have been withdrawn from their Randwick engage-
ments, and The Hawk has gone to Melbourne. Never-
theless, the A.. 1.0. should have a great Spring
meeting. Not for many years—certainly not since
Artilleryman and Richmond Main ran their memor-
able dead-heat in 1919—have there been two such
nailing good colts in the Derby as Heroic and Nigger
Minstrel. Heroic has been travelling splendidly on
Ihe track —on Saturday, with Reed up, he galloped
a mile in Imin. 4l|see., beating Purser by two
lengths. On the other hand, the Maorilander was
eased in his work after the slight mishap that
befel him at Rosehill on September 20, but lie lias
kept his place in the market, and the M.L. brigade
are confident. If nothing happens to prevent the
meeting, this page expects Nigger Minstrel to beat
Heroic on Saturday, but it should be a great race.
And the Derby winner (unless it happens to be
Spearfelt) will probably account for the older horses
in the Craven Plate.
Blackadder dominates the Epsom market, and he
is indisputably well in on recent, form. If the
handicapper had to do his job over again A. S.
Chirnside's horse would get at least 1410. added to
his Bst. lib., and one can’t see him beaten at the
weights by such as The .Monk (9st. Tib.), Otacre
(9st. 51b.), Farceur (Bst. 181 b.), Valdoona (Bst.
41b.), All Home (Tst. 71b.j or Collaroi (Tst, 41b.),
although Oollaroi’s chance would be respected but
for the accident which obliged his trainer to retire
the gross little horse for a fortnight. The only
thing against Blackadder is that he has never won
over the distance in fast time, and this is his fifth
season on the turf. More than once in a mile
handicap at Randwiek he seemed to have his field settled
at seven furlongs, only to fade in the last lot) yards
and finish out of a place. There are good reports of
Cistercian, who has four English races to his credit,
and Cliffdale has grown into a magnificent horse. At
three years, after having beaten Rivoli in the
Hawkesbury Guineas, won the A.J.C. Grantham
Stakes (nine furlongs) and Clibborn Stakes, and
run a fair second to Whittier in the V.R.C. Derby,
Cliffdale was awarded Bst. 71b. in the Doncaster,
and he has the same weight in the Epsom as a five-
year-old. In the effort to make a stayer of him his
pace suffered, and he was a very jaded animal for
a time, but he seems to have regained his brilliancy
and liking for the game, and this page’s 10s. will
go on his tote number, although it would be more
confident if the distance were 74 furlongs instead of
a mile. A horse with a rough chance is Honey Bee,
whose public trials have been rather impressive.
Highlander was The Bulletin's fancy for the
Metropolitan when the weights came out, and to
Highlander it will remain faithful. At the A.J.C.
Easter meeting the game son of Mountain King—
Winora ran fourth in the St. Leger, being just cut
out of a place by Drongo, who is fancied for the
Melbourne Cup with Bst. 51b., and a close fifth in the
Sydney Cup, after striking all sorts of bad luck. His
Cup weight was 7st., and with only 41b. more to
carry and a much better jockey in the saddle, he
should be worth a bet on the machine. If anything
beats him it may be his former stable-companion
El Dorado, who has done a great preparation and
was never better in his life. As for the long-
distance w.f.a. races, Ballymena may be the safest
speculation. Both fit and well, he is probably
inferior to Rivoli, but the Maoriland horse is known
to be in first-class condition, whereas there is a
doubt about the other.
The soft going at Moonee Valley on
Saturday proved to the liking of Amalfi, hitherto
a disappointment. Sail Antonio and Spearage were
equal favorites at 9 to 4, but, hitting the front
halt a mile from home, the English horse, who
started at 5 s, had things all his own way in the
•il? eft, beatill g San Antonio home by two lengths,
with Spearage the same distance away, third. Amalfi
ran the 1U furlongs in 2min. 36sec. He races in
ulark and Robinson’s colors and has 7st. 71b. in
the Caulfield Cup, but in that race he will meet
San Antonio on 191 b. worse terms.

“Machete": Paddon’s retirement from the
sculling game after his defeat of Goodsell calls
attention to Ihe curious fact that once a boat-puller
has won the world’s championship he usually keeps
!, , years. And not, because he dodges marches, as
the Dempseys do, either. Hanlan survived five chal-
lenges before Bill Beach got his scalp. Bill had a run
ot seven before retiring in Peter Kemp’s favor. Stan-
bury held on for four successive years, and won the
title again later, interrupting a series of four by Towns.
Dick Arnst scored five straight and a dubious sixth
when he beat Hannan in 1921. Now Paddon has
won four James off the reel. Since Ned Trickett
won m 18(6, the only world s champion scullers from
outside this country have been Hanlan and Gaudaur
(Canadians), AVebb, Arnst and Iladfield (Maori-
landers), and Barry (England).

The great question in Sydney cricket
circles is whether Jack Gregory can come back.
Haying for Manly against Randwiek in the first
round ot competition matches, the big Digger
thrilled the Manly crowd by bowling McCrystal and
MeCloy m the first over without a run being made.
But after rocking in three overs, off which nine
runs were hit, he was taken off, having strained a
muscle in his left leg, and although he remained on
the field and brought off a wonderful left-handed
f^ tch at fine leg, hurling himself at the ball in
the old way, he was obviously in pain after the
feat. So the question remains unanswered for the
present. Horrie Davis, a hitherto methodical left-
hander, playing for Waverley v. St. George, was
responsible for the finest batting performance of
the day. Together with H. L. Collins (85) ne
rattled up 1.89 for the first wicket, and his share of
Waverley s 439 (five wickets down) was 170, made
in 142 minutes. Davis generally strikes form early
in the season, but he has an unhappy knack of
losing it when the selectors put on their glasses.
Johnny Taylor got 115 (out of 284) for Uni. v.
Glebe. It will be a hard job to keep this sparkling
batsman and beautiful field out of the Australian XI.

“Tren” : Woodfull is not the onlv classy
Melbourne cricketer who has changed clubs (li.
25/9/’24). Prahran’s mainstay, Grimmett, has gone to
S.A. Les Keating, of Collingwood, who is as successful
in pennant cricket as, and more varied in method than
his club mate John Ryder, is to play with (and
coach) Richmond. Hampden Love, a first-class wicket-
keeper, but played in the Vic. team for his batting
alone, transfers from Carlton to St. Kilda, premiers
last year. Fred Yeomans, Northcote’s most prolific
rungetter, also goes to St. Kilda. An unfounded
impression that lie is an abominable field has kept
A eomans out of the inter-State team, though he has
several times been first emergency. Still another
seasoned warrior acquired by the seasiders is Clive
Fergie. He is a versatile athlete, equally at home
when roving for Fitzroy or banging centuries for
Melbourne. Ray Levin, too, the best junior bats-
man in the State, is joining Ponsford’s club, and,
on paper, it looks as though St. Kilda could give
every other team an innings start and still retain
the pennant.
Died the other day, .T. A. Bush, one of
the finest English wicketkeepers of the ’seventies and
’eighties. He played for Gloucestershire and visited
Australia with one of the early-day teams. Bush,
who was knotvn as “Fuzzy” owing to the luxuriant
whiskers which distinguished him even in that hirsute
age, was just about as execrable a batsman as he was
excellent behind the sticks, and the first straight ball
generally settled him. His brother Robert, who was
also a bit of a cricketer, emigrated to West Australia
and did remarkably well as a squatter in the Nor’-
West. He named his station Clifton Downs, and
returned to his native Clifton a wealthy man some
years before the war. During the war he did some
memorable work for Australian soldiers, providing
hospital accommodation on a generous scale.

Mostyn Evan is resigning the president-
ship of S.A. Cricket Association, his health having
given anxiety of late. He has been connected with
the S.A.C.A. for 38 years, and president for the last
four; also, he was a member of the Board of Control
from its foundation, and of the Australian Cricket
Council before that. One of the new stands on the
Adelaide Oval is to be named after him, the other
after the late John Creswell. The Cricket Association
had only one president before Evan —E. T. Smith.
Harold Fisher is to be the next, though he is away
on an English trip for the moment.

“Cutter”: Young Quin, the new M.L.
amateur golf champion, is literally paddock-trained.
The Eltham links are on old-man Quin’s farm. Four
or five years ago the boys started rounding up the
cows, cleek in hand. They continued this daily
practice, as a result of which, -with no professional
coaching, three of them are equal to taking on any
other golfer in M.L.

“Rio”: Those riflemen who for years have
been abusing the “short” rifle and “military methods”
must feel rather small nowadays. At Long Bay
(N.S.W.), under moderate weather conditions, two
trainees tied twice for the Sun Cup—-eight shots at 300
yards at a small disappearing tin-hat target, with only
three seconds’ exposure ; no sighters. Each youngster put
six of his eight bullets through the enemy * head.
In the Brand-ten shots at 500 yards, deliberate, with
two sighters and a large tin-hat —the winner made
the possible, and half a dozen others only missed the
bull once. What have the clubs to teacli these boys
that is of any defence value ?
* * * *
“S.G.” : The death of H. E. Kater, M.L.C.,
recalls the formation of the N.S.W. Lawn Tennis Asso-
ciation, the parent of the present Commonwealth
organisation. In the early ’nineties the N.S.W. tennis
world was run by the autocratic Sydney club. Subur-
ban bodies had no say whatever, and inter-club
matches were carried on without control or organisa-
tion of any sort. Then one day a few suburban
clubbers revolted and formed tne association, of
which H. E. lvater was president, Arthur Griffith
(then a Grammar School master) secretary, and
Walter Bird treasurer. The Sydney club refused to
recognise the interloper, but the latter calmly arranged
■i series of inter-club matches, leaving Sydney out.
This made the Big-City monopolists sit up. Their
members found themselves stranded, as it were; they
had to join associated clubs to get a match. So
next year Sydney came in. Since then the Association
has had complete conti’ol of tennis in N.S.W., and
the A.L.T.A., which has done so much for the game,
is chiefly the result of its efforts.

Although the verdict went against him on
a foul, Aneel Bell (Bst. 13Jib.) added to his Aus-
tralian credentials in his fight with Bert Spargo
(9st. 21b.) at the Melbourne Stadium. He had much
the better of the affair on points, and when Spargo
dropped squirming after a hot rally on the ropes
in the 13th round, the crowd thought the paleface
was acting, and cheered the frankly puzzled and
disappointed nigger. The referee thought differently,
and crowned Spargo. The foul—if foul there was—
was quite unintentional, and the black had rotten
luck.

Harry Young’s conquering march at the
Sydney Stadium was halted by Harry Casey, another
of those anaemic Queenslanders. The pallid victim
of the tropics rushed, at Young as soon as the bell
rang and smote him balefully for 20 minutes
or thereabouts. When lie grew tired of punching,
he butted the unhappy youth. In the seventh round
the Roselle welter w r as down twice, and, gazing
pitifully at the staggering pug, Casey suggested to
the referee that it was time to stop it. Stopped it
was.

Though there was small hope of Richmond
beating Essendon by 40 points, and thereby earning
the right to a challenge match for the Vic. League
premiership, 22,000 enthusiasts pushed into "South
Melbourne ground on Saturday to see whether the
Tigers could bring it off. The gents, with the striped
guernseys made a game effort to oblige. Playing
faster and with superior system, they held the ’Dons
throughout and boat them by 20 points—67 to
’Don’s 47 —but that wasn’t enough, so the penna'i
goes to the Same Old for the second consecutive yeai.
Richmond were next and Fitzroy third. Under tii
old system the Tigers would in all probability ha. c
come out on top. After beginning the season badly,
they stiffened their backs and went steadily ahead;
and the credit for their great recovery is chiefly
due to their captain, Danny Minogue. South Mel-
bourne and ’Roy also collided on tiie Melbourne
ground, South winning by 18 points after a willing
struggle in which casualties were frequent and pain-
ful. Apparently (hey just bogged in for the pure
joy of bogging, as neither side could) gain anything
by a victory'. During the riot, the effervescent Jack
Moriarty, of ’Roy r , collected another four goals, thus
achieving the record of 82 for the season.
“Winkle”: Melbourne football ended with wails of
anguish from its mentors and howls of derision from
the public. Not content with the lucre crowds of
50,000 paid at each ofl two semi-finals and a final,
with a splendid chance of a reull.v bumper house at
a play-off, the authorities invented a scheme tha l
necessitated six semis with a possibility of a grand
final, and confidently expected that: their coffers would
need enlarging to hold the extra dough. An unkind
fate was against them, however, and put its finger on
the weak spot of the system in one try. Essendon,
already minor premiers, beat Fitzroy and Stousli
Melbourne, and the Maroons accounted for Richmond.
So, as Essendon were then premiers, the public, who
had been always apathetic towards the new scheme,
remained away from the two remaining matches in
enormous numbers, and the wonderful innovation, that
was to double the League’s income, actually cost it
thousands of pounds. Needless to say, the fool-experi-
ment, which allowed Essendon to be badly' beaten in
the last match of the season and still be premiers,
will be scrapped; and' the old method, which drew
the mob and gave the pennant to the winner of the
final, will return.
“G. 0.8.”: Amid the puffing, panting and
wild scrambles that made up the old buffers’
match at Melbourne, Teddy Rowell played as
if still in his prime. Decades ago Teddy was Col-
lingwood’s star halt-forward, and his 'consistent 60-
yard kicks and lightning dashes put him among
the immortals—so called because they will be remem-
bered for quite half a century'. Then he followed
the boom to W.A. When long past the age when
most toeballers are down and out he returned to
the Magpie nest, and for years was the best full-
back in the League. When he did retire his powers
were still to be wondered at, but he explained that
he would really have to attend to an increasing
number of clients who clamored to put money' in
his bag at the gee-g:ees.
Adelaide Football League has been dis-
cussing one of the oddest votes of censure on record
—on the Port Adelaide XVIII for having given
three cheers for a goal umpire. As he had just given
a goal against them which their keeper warmly dis-
puted, and as during the cheers (they occurred at
the “lemons” interval) an enamel mug was thrown
in his direction, the cheering was asserted to be
ironical and disrespectful. The vote hung in sus-
pense for a fortnight; but then, on the strong state-
ment of Port delegates that the cheering was genuine
and meant to show that the players bore no malice,
the idea of censure was dropped. So was the matter
of the mug.
League Rugby is not the only variety of
football in which Sydney has fared badly in 1924.
St. Patrick’s, premiers of the Ovens and Murray
district, came to town last week and ran rings round
Paddington, boss of the Sydney clubs that play Aus-
tralian Rules, scoring 83 points to 56. And the final
of the State Soccer premiership was contested by
West Wallsend and Woonona, the Norther ners winning
by three goals to nil. They had previously established
their ascendancy over the best of the Sydney teams.

“Lily-Beale”: Davy Hearne, of Dubbo
(N.S.W.), is surely the oldest footballer playing in
inter-town matches. At 46 he led the Dubbo Rugby
League team to victory against Geurie. Davy has
pursued the leather constantly for 28 seasons and
has figured in 56 inter-district matches.
“Centurion”: In their first four matches
against English teams, the All Blacks scored 52
points to nil—ll against Devon, 29 against Corn-
wall, and 6 each against Somerset and Gloucester - .
The 1905 side beat Devon 55 —4, Somerset 23—0,
Cornwall 41—0, and Gloucester 44—0. Swansea,
the strongest of the Welsh clubs, were unmercifully
trounced by thq present invaders, who got 39 to 3.
The 1905 team cnly beat Swansea 4—3: a field goal to
a try. The Wallabies and the 1912-13 Springboks
were both defeated by the Welshmen, who didn’t play
the 1906 ’Boks. It is recorded that the present
Swansea side had been specially prepared for last
week’s meeting, and a 39 —3 win, on a Welsh ground
and before a Welsh crowd of 30,000, makes the All
Blacks look good.

“Past Grammar” : The Rugby Union does
not consider any team playing less than 15 a side
professional, as “Nitric” (B. 25/9/’24) suggests. If
a team likes to play two or three men short, ns
occasionally happens, no legal penalty attaches. What
the R.U. does notice is indulging in a game or other-
wise being connected with “any football organi-
sation declared by the Union to be a professional
body.” Further, it is not “generally accepted” that
any amateur competing with professionals become? a
pro. It is the sternest and mdst inflexible of amateur
laws, as “Snowy” Baker once found out. Lawton was
certainly accounted a technical professional for
playing the League game, and he was so informed be-
fore he left Queensland for Oxford. The R.U. took a
favorable (and just) view of his case and withdrew
his temporal - '' suspension, at the same time removing
any possible stigma that may have attached to hi?
club-mates mentioned by “Nitric.” As for Greening,
a Queensland League player who “Nitric” says turned
out with Blackheat.h club, he cither received a dis-
pensation, or his League connection did not come
under the notice of the authorities; and the >ae»
may be said of the Navy men who played League
rules in Brisbane with 15 a side, “to preserve their
amateur status!” The subterfuge could not glo?~
over their offence. The All Blacks, whose ca?e
“Nitric” cites, receive an allowance because the
laws of amateurism, now permit it. The Australian
and M.L. by-laws allowed it in the days of the
original All Blacks, and though the idea was smth -
at. in Britain, it was quite legal under the good
old law of “custom.” That explains, I think, what
“Nitric” calls “these puzzles.”
THRILLS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“The Shado-Gornik heavyweight contest in the
Brisbane Stadium was full of thrills.... Two bottles
came hurtling through the air into the ring; the
thrower was subseqhently fined £5 in the police-
court, for assaulting the referee.”
They mixed it merrily with jab and swing
When suddenly, like bolts from out the blue,
Propelled with fell intent into the ring
A brace of bottles flew.
They circled round and feinted, smashed and smote ;
A heftier scrap you’d never wish to see.
But episodes like this might get the goat
Of any referee.
The blatant howl and frenzied oath which tell
That foaming partisans have got me set,
The bellowed insult and the angry yell
Have never moved me yet.
Thin-skinned is he who jibs at verbal blame
From biased barrackers whose greasy wads
Hang in the balance. That is in the game,
This is beyond the odds.
How can a fellow keep a lynx-like eye ;
To see that blows are fair and fighting clean
When he himself must duck occasion’lly
To dodge a dead marine?
How can lie tear apart two pugs that clinch
And protests how uphold or disallow
What time a bottle by a narrow inch
Misses his furrowed brow?
All very well for Gornik and for Shade
To take or shield themselves from wallop shot
In their direction. That is what they’re paid
To do —and I am not.
A memorable mill, the fans declare,
A contest full of thrills. Take it from me,
When empty pints go whizzingf through the air
It thrills the referee!

“W.L.” (U.S.A.) : California is the place
to hear old songs sung by radio warblers
and in the home. The years roll away when
“Old Madrid” is wafted through the tree-
scented night, and memories get another jolt
when the encore is “Love's Serenade.” “The
Boys of the Old Brigade” was supposed to
have been dead and buried long since, but
here it still has a vogue. The biggest shock
an Australian can get, though, is to hear the
tune of “God Save the King” and to find
that the audience is singing “My Country,
’Tis of Thee.” An impulsive Australian girl
caused a sensation at a concert when she
rose, as she thought, to honor Georgius V.
and found the audience beginning to push
out. “What? Aren’t they going to play ‘God
Save the King’?” she asked in a clear voice.
Her friends hurried her away, but the Ameri-
cans only smiled.
“H.G.F.”: Whisky was scarce in France,
and to Frenchmen it was a welcome
•relief from the everlasting vin-rouge and ver-
mouth. So when we were sent down to the
Rheims front we stocked up and every even-
ing we had thirsty visitors from the French
squadrons. One night we saw a party of
them away in cars, with their legs hanging
over the sides. About nine next morning we
were looking over our machines when a Spad
came along, flying a few feet oft' the ground.
The pilot treated us to the finest exhibition of
low-stunting I have ever seen. He just
about turned that ’bus inside out. Hurriedly
we brought out the ambulance car. But it
wasn’t required. He landed out of a loop
perfectly, and taxied up to the hangars. One
of our friends of the previous night. He was
in pyjamas, and he couldn’t stand straight.
“Ah, zee gloreeous veesky!” he gurgled, as
we put him to bed.
“Hamfat”: George Rignold was not
often put out of his stride, but a
remark that was once hurled at him
when he was playing Richard 111.
upset him badly. In one of the stalls was a
well-beered citizen who would waken from
sleep at intervals to gaze blurrily and won-
deringly around him, preparatory to dozing
peacefully again. But the Bosworth Field
scene woke him up properly, and he stared
at the performers, as if engaged (as no doubt
he was) in trying to recollect why he was
there and what it was all about. It was
at this point the thunderous demand for “A
horse! A horse! My kingdom for a horse!”
made the roof ring. The muzzy gentleman
evidently concluded he was being approached
for a tip, and he beamed on Richard 111.
“Y’ might try a bit on Carnage for the Cup,”
was his advice.
“Scalpel” : Recent pars, concerning strange
war casualties bring to mind one which
occurred in France in the early months of
1916. While a party was on a job a large
shell landed and burst only a few yards
away from them. Two men were killed
outright by flying fragments, and several
more were wounded. When the confusion
had died down it was seen that there was
still another casualty, the victim being a
man who had been further away than any
of the others. He was quite dead, yet the
only mark of violence on liis body was a red
line on one side of his neck. An examina-
tion showed that the cause of death was a
broken neck, two of the cervical vertebrae
having boon neatly fractured. The opinion
arrived at was that this had boon due to
air-waves, set in motion by the explosion,
striking the man’s nock at the spot where
the vertebra? wore fractured. Cases in which
men wore more or loss severely injured by
the air-waves from bursting shells were com-
mon, but as far as I know this was the only
one in which death was caused in so exact a
manner.
“G.F.”; This is the story of a casual air-
man. We escorted his machine thinking
that he had developed engine trouble, and
desirous of seeing him safely to our side of
the lines. But the ’bus kept its height.
Presently we ran into a bunch of Huns and
had a running fight, while protecting the
erratic ’plane and cursing its occupant. It
kept on the wide circle, sailing serenely along
as if indifferent to spitting machine-guns.
When nearing the lines again a succession
of “Archie” bursts near it galvanised it into
activity, and the patrol went on as usual.
Half a dozen puzzled friends surrounded the
pilot at the ’drome and demanded the reason
why. It appeared that he’d set the wheel
controlling the tail-plane so that the ’bus
flew along without the necessity for much
control (it was a calm morning) ; then he
had leaned his head back, and, utterly tired
out, had gone to sleep ! As he relaxed, his
left foot went forward slightly and put on
some rudder. He slept in oblivion of the
scrap we’d been in. until the bursting anti-
aircraft shells woke him up. He made up
for it next day by bringing two Huns down
in flames.
“X2X” on a cheerful topic:—
“Gouger” is wrong when he says that the Chinese
introduced leprosy to the natives of Cape York
Peninsula (B. 11/9/’24). The chances are that the
disease was endemic there for ages before the first
Celestial set foot in Northern Australia. Most likely
if came from New Guinea, just across the straits,
for there undoubtedly was communication between
the natives of the two places. The natives of New
Guinea do not exhibit the same fear of the disease as
those of Northern Australia, and no effort is ever
made to isolate sufferers from it. In fact, it is no
uncommon thing to see a leper who has been living
in the one village for 10 or 12 years, where, perhaps,
he has married and become the father of a family ;
and a circumstance which supports the theory that
the infectiousness of leprosy has been greatly over-
rated is that such lepers are frequently the only ones
in the village who are afflicted. Leprosy is found
right throughout the North-Western Pacific, from the
Solomons to the Gilberts and Marshalls. Yet it
would probably be found that less than one in a
thousand of the native populations in various places
is infected. There are some who are of the opinion
that the epidemic of leprosy which ravaged Europe
from the twelfth century to about the sixteenth was
brought to a halt by the rigorous measures taken
for the isolation of everybody; who was as much as
suspected of suffering from the complaint. What is
more likely is that the disease finally died out be-
cause its very presence bred a resistance, while it
is even possible that much of what was mistaken for
leprosy was really different forms of skin disease.
Certain it is that the natives of the Pacific pay
very little attention to it when it occurs in their
midst. Probably “Gouger’s” natives acquired their
fears and their system of quarantining from white
men with whom they had been in contact.

SOME things improve with age. Violins,
for instance, and port wine. Other
things go off colour and quickly lose
their form. Particularly unstropped razor
blades.
There is only one way to preserve the life of
a razor blade. It is to strop it.
Elence the Valet razor. With the Valet
there is no question of “to strop or not to
strop”; the Valet and its strop are one —a
joint concern. It’s only a matter of seconds,
this stropping of the Valet. You slip it on
the strop, flip it up and down—and there
you are. A perfectly good sharp blade for
use once more.
There are no “bits” to the Valet. It is all one.
And its cleaning is just a rinse and a wipe.

The Viennese cooks responsible for “The
Cousin from Nowhere," which was served at
Sydney Royal on Saturday, describe their
concoction as a "musical romance” ; but the
pretty dish betrays the usual ingredients of
musical comedy, arranged in slightly different
proportions, and places no strain upon the
assimilative organs. A little less leg and
more tunefulness than we have got used to,
a slender seasoning of plot and elegant gar-
nishings of Dutch scenery make up the
recipe. A fat yellow moon beaming through-
out the play over the same landscape of
windmills, tulips and canals inspires Jill
Manners, as Julia, to melodious melancholy,
because it is also supposed to be shining on
her childhood’s love, the cousin in Batavia.
Claude Flemming, a robustious vagabond who
looks as if the road agreed with him, blows
in and is mistaken for the cousin. On this
somewhat attenuated theme a good deal of
hugging between the vagabond and the lady,
plenty of broad farce by Gus Bluett, some
dainty dancing by the Twelve Tulips, and a
perfectly astounding acrobatic jazz by
Charles Brooks are incontinently strung.
* * * *
To Floie Allan go the laurels of the even-
ing. A compact little dynamo of irresistible

of the movement of the play, while Claude

the country like a flame. There was no
romance and not an overwhelming amount
of music about the attempt of Jill Manners,
until a few weeks ago serving at a Sydney
lace counter, to prove herself a newly-dis-
covered star of the first magnitude. She did
her anxious best, poor girl, but only helped
to show that the unsophisticated freshness
and youthful charm of a Maggie Moore (for
instance) can only be acquired after years of
disillusioning toil.
A full house of grown-up children left their
sons and daughters listening-in to Goodnight
Stories, and crowded on to Allan Wilkie’s knee
at Sydney Palace on Saturday night to hear
a nursery fairy tale that never seems to pall;
and judging by the house’s unaffected mirth
the old-fashioned story and tin; old-fashioned
way of telling it still holds its charm. The wine
of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” needs no
bush—only good acting; and a well-selected
cast assisted Wilkie in portraying humanly
and vividly the two worlds of fact and faery
of Shakspeare’s creation, and did it before
a background of dark cloth hangings
which mercifully spared the spectators’ eyes
the distraction of badly-painted scenery.
* * * *
Love amongst the spirits was perhaps a
little more robust than love amongst the
humans. Irene Webb, Ellis Irving, Leslie
Manners and Jean Atholl in the mundane
sphere might have fallen in and out with
more vim and passion; but Miss Hunter-
Watts plays fairy queens better than tragedy
ones, and made a graceful Titania without
the conventional regal trappings, while her
chief batman, little Phyllis Scully, earns
special mention from a mere mortal for her
finished dancing; as also Kiore King, who
as Puck indicated her ability to put a girdle
round the earth in 40 minutes by hopping
frequently over a log nearly two feet high.
In the gross, material sphere Wilkie and his
well-drilled troupe of Athenian trades-union-
ists performed the “tedious brief scene” of
Pyramus and Thisbe to excellent effect, ex-
tracting all its rich store of humor. The
“noise,” as the orchestra was called in the
days of Queen Elizabeth, was pleasingly pro-
vided by De Bourguignon.

Allan Wilkie made another of his light-
ning changes when he plunged from the
fairy story of Saturday night to the black
tragedy of “Macbeth” on Monday. The man
next to this Sundry Showman at the Cri.
had evidently mistaken the Shakspearean
performance for a moving picture, a quite
excusable error considering the similarity be-
tween the advertisements of the two. He
sat patiently enough through the scene of
the witches, supposing it to be one of these
vaudeville stunts which serve as preliminaries
to the real celluloid stuff. As the action un-
folded itself in tedious dialogues, however,
he grew restless. “I don’t talk their lan-
guage,” he muttered in the middle of the
Thane’s long soliloquy in the third scene, of
the first act. and got up to go. A companion
gently impelled him back into his seat and
advised him to hang on a little. The murder
of Duncan cheered him, and when the ghost
of Banquo appeared with his throat cut from
car to ear he chuckled happily. “That’s the
stuff to give ’em,” he murmured. By the
end of the third act he was counting the mur-
ders greedily on his fingers. “Dunno who
this bloke Shakspeare is,” he confided at the
end, “but he puts it across all right.”
At Sydney Cri. “The Old Soak” will cease
from hooching and the bootlegger abandon
his nefarious trade after to-morrow night.
“The Laughter of Fools” is the next course
on the John D. O’Hara bill-o’-fare.
At Sydney Majesty’s Alfred Frith and
various other people brimming over with

Sydney Tivoli presents an original and
clever entertainer in “Mr. Hymac," with
his spirited representation of a wooden figure
outside an ole-clo’ shop coming to life to
lay his heart and a bewildering quantity of
his haberdashery at the feet of an attractive
wax mannequin in the neighboring draper’s
shop. Albert Whelan, humorous and tune-
ful. has established himself as a prime favo-
rite : Bert Errol gives abundant proofs of
his versatility, and Marie Burke and
Arthur Klein deliver a generous selection of
musical goods. Nell Crane sparkles and
trills melodiously, and Maggie Foster fiddles
with feeling.
Thomas Meighan, a confidence man bur-
dened with a conscience, leaves the booty in
the safe at the Sydney Lyceum this week.
At the Lyric, Tom Mix sets out to prevent
a. marriage by kidnapping everyone in the
town who can perform the ceremony. “The
Rejected Woman” is boarding at the Crystal
Palace, and the point she stresses is that
the male wooer loses a great deal of his gal-
lantry when he leaves the country for the
city. Stella POwer is making a farewell
appearance in between pictures at the same
house. “Cold Steel,” at the Empress, is the
story of a son’s struggle to vindicate the old
man’s good name; and “Trailing Wild Ani-
mals,” at the Globe, should appeal to the
sturdy suburbanite who sets a mousetrap
every night of his life. A mummer turned
clergyman is the central figure of “Held to
Answer,” which keeps the Strand house-
staff hard at work. Hoyt’s are screening
“Those Who Dance,” a new class of drama
made possible by the Eighteenth Amendment.
Villainy, of course, is personified by a gang
of bootleggers, and moral goodness by a pro-
hibition officer.
Poor preliminary work was responsible
for a distressingly slack attendance when
the Scottish basso William Heughan gave
his first Melbourne concert at the Town Hall
on Friday; but the small audience provided
large applause. It was deserved. Heughan
has a robust, pleasing voice, of extraordinary
flexibility, allied to dramatic sense and mag-
netic personality; and, unbowed by circum-
stances, he displayed his versatility in songs
which varied from “Laird of Cockpen” to
such operatic selections as “Se II Rigor”
(from Halevy’s “La Ebrea”), in which the
passages of religious fervor were finely
stressed. The Prologue from “Pagliacci” (in
English) was rendered with more histrionic
understanding than is usually supplied; and
amongst a crowd of folk songs and Scotch
melodies “My Love is Like a Red, Red
Rose” gave great pleasure. Although helped
through by an excellent pianist, Miss Gladys
Sayer, and a clever violinist, Miss Lilian
Pether —she is an Adelaide girl whose play-
ing of Svensen’s “Romance in G” showed

CRITERION.

O'Hara as the Old Soak.
great delicacy of tone —it was practically a
one-man show: Heughan sang a score of
songs with such diversity of treatment that
no one was tired. The next concerts are to
occur at the Assembly Hall on Friday and
Saturday of next week (Oct. 10 and 11).
At the end of next week “Bought and Paid-
For” will succeed “East of Suez.” The man-
agement says that the arrangement is to
enable the Eastern atmosphere and other fix-
ings to be packed away and transported to
Adelaide, where, after a fortnight’s further
stay in Melbourne, the Muriel Starr co. is
to open. “Aren’t We All?” will fill the Mel-
bourne King’s Theatre vacancy on Oct. 25.
The New Princess’s is still experiencing the
kind of business which maketh glad the heart
of managers, any inquiry as to when “Rosie
O’Reilly” is likely to desert Melbourne being
met with the smile of derision.
The illness of Edith Drayson, which gave
Bryl Walkley another opportunity to show her
quality, has been the only recent incident of
note in. the career of “The Lady of the Rose,”
at His Majesty’s. The fine-looking New-
castle girl did nothing to make Melbourne
any the less satisfied with either the likeable
story or its musical trimmings.
Melbourne New Palace crowds have taken
“Old Bill, M.P.,” to their hearts, and cheer
him nightly on his \yay to the salvation of
Britain. The earnest inquiry of a gallery-
ite for information as to whether the honest-
hearted old chap is a Freetrader or a Pro-
tectionist has been ignored by Seymour
Hicks. No doubt it is in keeping with s
political characterisation to be vague on
these subjects.
In spite of the handicap of arriving to find
that a great deal of his “business” has
already been done by vaudeville pirates, the
unctuous humor of Harry Weldon has se-
cured him the welcome of uproarious laughter
at Melbourne Royal. Hilda Glyder, although
her voice resembles an exhaust, also goes
well; she claims to be the originator of “Oh,
Johnny!” and gives it with effect. Barba-
rina is a lady who has found a use for a
pom. in neat circus tricks, and S. W.
Wyndliam is an indifferent comedian who
“gets over” on a freak voice—a regular
Little Ticli of a voice.
The red turret of Marie Kendall is back
at Melbourne Tivoli, where she, scores with
broadsides of the kind of humor which is
only excused by its cleverness. Rich Hayes,
a juggler who relieves an ordinary act by
unusual eccentricity, is another addition to
a programme of exceptional quality.
Probably the three most pleased men in
Melbourne at the end of last week were the
promoters of the “Aussie Rougliriders” car-
nival, which prevailed at Wirtlis’ Olympia
during Show Week. Enthusiastic horsemen,
though now retired from that game, their
idea was to find out who really is Austra-
lia’s champion roughrider, and they thought
the public would support the venture suffi-
ciently to cover their outlay. Instead, for
seven nights the big Olympia building had
practically every scat occupied; and on one
of the nights, which looked no better than
the others, the value of the house was “well
over £400.” Besides the thrills of the rough-
riding * there w r as plenty of fun in the
attempts of the small boy of Melbourne to
stick on the usual sophisticated mule and ox.
The championship went to Vic Cowan.
Two little Shows in Melbourne: —
After hearing Miss J. C. A. Traill’s enraptured
talk about .the scaffolded new buildings glimpsed from
the window of her studio, it is possible to compre-
hend the enthusiasm which has put decorative beauty
into her pictures of the big electricity works at
Yalloum. The strength and freedom of her effort, and
the artistic perception behind it, give an impression
of the bigness of the project. There is hasty work in
a few of the pictures of Victorian scenery, but “Genoa
Peak, from Mallacoota East,” and “Wet Day, Gipsy
Point,” are appealing, and “Evening, Mallacoota
West,” is an attractive aquatint.
At the Sackville Art Gallery some of Henri
Ifoile’s water-colors show an artist who believes that
if Nature differs from him it must be dashed well
mistaken. Yet, though failing almost grotesquely at
times, he strikes elsewhere both truth and attractive
effects. “The Gay from Croydon” gives an illusion of
pleasing spaciousness, “Stepping Stones” is good, and
“Mountain Mists,” in which the effect is very simply
secured, is better.
At Adelaide Royal manager Myers is pil-
ing up records, possibly for attendance and
certainly for money taken. The Grand
Opera season goes all the more strongly for
having been delayed. Toti dal Monte lias
been taken to the public heart; but the mere
appearance of Melba in a box —she hopes to
sing later —arouses equal enthusiasm. The
opera has “got Adelaide going,” and the
season is to be extended. At the Prince of
Wales’s, Carter is reproducing his show of
illusions; at the Majestic St. Leon’s posing
dogs dispute the chief place on the bill with
Con Moreni. In pictures, Potash and Perl-
mutter, at the York, reproduce their quaint
humor of the stage. The best thing at Won-
dergraph is the man with an accident-insur-
ance policy who tries vainly to get damaged
by cars, trams and trains. At West’s a re-
markable monkey and dog prove once again
that animals are the most reliable actors for
the screen.
From an Adelaide critic :—■
The value of a special prize as an art stimulus
is shown in the greatly increased number of figure
studies since Alec Melrose offered a yearly award in
this formerly neglected branch. The present Society
of Arts show had to think a long time before
awarding the prize to Alex. A. Pauli for a “portrait
of A.V.P.,” to which the words “posing as Carmen”
might fitly have been added. The painting is auda-
cious; and strongly reflects the influence of Lam-
bert. The present critic would have preferred
either a Sommers or a Boxall at the other end of
the room. There was less hesitation o'er the new
landscape prize given by the Society. It goes to a
“THE RISE OF ROSIE O'REILLY,” AT

brilliant study by John Giles, in the Will Ashton
manner, of ships in sunlight in Port Adelaide
harbor. Other good portraits arc by Irene Gross-
ing and Elizabeth Armstrong. George 111111111011 lias
a powerful study of the Central mine at Broken
Hill, and Leila McNamara shows a judicious Heysen
influence in her study of cows and gumtrees “after
heavy frost.” The prize (if any) for a cryptic title
would go to Mary Harris, who shows a cottage and
some fowls and calls it “The Pentecostal Miracle.”

“Wodgil”: I get so weary of present-day
music-hall compositions, with their eternal
“coal-black mammys” and “cuties” and
“chickens,” that sometimes I pine for the
simple Cockney ditties of my remote youth.
Even “Marther, the Watercrcase Gel” would
be a refreshing change from jazz-ballads of
the “Gee, Kid, You Are Ma Ba-uli-ha-uh-ha-
by” order. I heard “Marther, the Water-
crease Gel” in a Collingwood bar 34 years
ago—it was sung in a hoarse voice by a
gentleman with a fish-basket in which a
layer of debilitated garfish was imposed on
a stratum of mullet and flathead. The chorus,
which was solemnly taken up by the other
citizens in the bar —all habitues of Wren’s
tote —went something like this :
An’ der ’air ’ung dahn in tresses,
Dahn in the val-lee, dahn in the dell:
She was gathereeng WAW-tercresses,
Was Marther, the Wawtercrease Gel.
I would much rather meet Marther again,
primitive as she was, than listen to a whine
about a tedious negress, or a blatant tribute
to some slangy young savage with shingled
hair, a hard mouth and a devotion to whisky
and other habits from which the Cockney
heroine was free.
“Hamfat”: A yearning for something
higher than musical comedy has prompted
Bob Chisholm to book a passage by the
Italian boat leaving Melbourne on October
4. His destination is Milan, where im-
presarios, maestros and similar cattle will
have learned from members of the Grand
Opera co. with whom he has fraternised that
Bob is a baritone to be encouraged. Born
in Melbourne, Chisholm went to the war be-
fore he had time to make a mark in anything.
Returning, he exhibited a voice which earned
him a place in the “Maid of the Mountains”
cast, and he has played “opposite” Gladys
Moncrieff in other productions since. He
was the English yotter who mashed Gladys
in “A Southern Maid,” and a very agree-
able yotter, too.
“S. Gumm”: After its successes in the
Bellevue and Halifax competitions the New-
castle Steelworks Band finished a close third
in the Crystal Palace championship. The
test piece was an arrangement of old Cornish
airs—familiar, no doubt, to the English
bands, but unknown to our men —and the
steelworkers had to practise it at odd times
during a provincial tour rendered necessary
by the saddening condition of their finances.
In the circumstances their third was a great
achievement, for 15 first-class bands com-
peted. Bert Baile, their conductor, used to
be a grocer in Perth. But the business
wouldn’t run to an assistant’s wages, and
when Mrs. Gasworks called for “three pound
o’ sugar and a packet o’ self-raisin’,” the
grocer would be in a back room playing
“Oh, Promise Me” on the cornet, the strains
of which drowned the lady’s shrill cries of
“Shop!” and other attempts to attract his
attention. So Mrs. Gasworks took her cus-
tom to the store round the corner, and there
came a day when “Dryblower” Murphy, wit-
tiest of Westralians, wrote cruelly of “Bert
Baile’s latest and finest composition—with
his creditors.” But Baile had by this time
found his metier, and took the gibe smiling.
“Minim”: Conducting without referring to
the score (B. 18/9/’24) was always our
own Slapoffski’s custom during the operatic
performances with which he was associated.
And one never sees the music on the desk
of that very efficient waver of the stick,
Victor Champion, of the J.C.W. firm. Which
reminds me that I have met Australian pro-
ducers who have known practically all the
dialogue of the new piece in hand. They
may not have memorised the entire play, but
they have been able to prompt any of the
actors without reference to the script.
From Cockney P. Pointer:—
London’s latest revue, “The Odd Spot,” at the
Vaudeville, is the work of Dion Titheradge, brother
of Madge, and, like her, a native of Melbourne. It
takes its title from the colloquial name of a coffee-
stall at which quaint characters congregate when
London has gone to bed. Binnie Hale is the life
and soul of the piece.
Kenneth Barnes, brother of Irene and Violet Van-
brugh, has written a play, “The Alibi,” which the
statuesque Violet is to produce. It is not his first
experiment as a playwright. He wrote some pieces
while serving in India, and they were performed by
amateurs at Simla.
Bernard Shaw has been interpreting the will of
his old friend Marie Corelli, and expressing cordial
concurrence with the clause that debars actors and
actresses from admission to the hostel for “distin-
guished visitors,” which is to be set up in Stratford-
on-Avon at the expense of her estate. Most of us
thought—and some do still—that Marie was working
off some old grudge against the profession when she
made this pointed reservation; but, according to
Shaw, she was acting wisely, because in the absence
of some such stipulation the hostel would degenerate
into a free boarding-house for all sorts and conditions
of strolling players. Shaw adds that if the lady had
consulted him he would have strongly advised her to
bar mummers, and that, anyhow, it would have been
the manifest duty of her solicitor to make the sugges-
tion.
Shaw’s “Joan of Arc,” by the way, is to be with-
drawn from the New Theatre in October,, but Sybil
Thorndike, who has scored so heavily as the Maid of
Orleans, has undertaken to revive it when she returns
to London from her provincial tour. Sybil confesses
that she never anticipated the thing would run so
long and become the most popular play in town. “I
only gave it a few weeks,” she says, “and my husband
said two months at the outside. And it has run
since March!”
“Second Murderer”: “T.P.” wonders (B.
25/9/’24) what became of Lily and Rose
Dampier, who appeared as the infants in
“Babes in the Wood” with J. R. Greville.
Lily and Rose were identified with the drama
in Australia for many years, Lily being
leading woman in scores of her father’s
CORRECTED.
“So you’ve got a job?”
“Yep. They’ve engaged me at a fabulous
salary.”
“Fabulous? You mean it’s a myth, I sup-
pose.”
productions. She was said to be the young-
est Lady Macbeth our stage has known; and
Rose was also a w T ell-known stage figure.
Lily married Alfred Rolfe, an actor who is
now living in retirement in Sydney, and their
only child, Sydney, is the manager of a
warehouse in York-street. Lily Dampier
died in Sydney a few years ago, Rose having
predeceased her in the U.S.A. Fred, the
brother, Alfred Dampier’s only son, and the
only surviving member of the family, is in
America.
“Norbell”: On the last night of “Masses
and Man,” lately presented at St. James’s
Hall, Sydney, by Duncan Macdougall’s Play-
box Society, the performance closed with
“God Save the King.” Thereupon a handful
of the audience rendered a bit of “The Red
Flag.” As any peg is good enough for some
politicians to hang the Union Jack on, Scott
Fell, M.L.A., asked the Col. Secretary in the
House if his “attention had been drawn” to
the revolutionary outbreak of song, and re-
quested that “a representative of the law”
should be sent to hear a lecture on the play
which Macdougall had announced for the fol-
lowing Sunday. Incidentally, he declared
that the object of Toller’s play was to “assist
the communist movement,” whereas the thing
CLOSING THE SAFETY-VALVE.
THE STUDENT : “Ah, I shall have to learn
French. You always pay me your de-
lightful compliments in your own beau-
tiful language.”
THE MASTER: “Ah, no, no, mademoiselle.
If you learn zc language I shall have to
be speechless.”
is about as communistic as “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” In the Leg. Assembly subsequently
the Col. Secretary said that he had duly
sent the police along, and the ser-r-geant had
submitted the following :
I beg to report that at 7 p.m. on the 7th instant, I
was at St. James’s Hall, but no meeting was held
there, and the hall was not opened.
Mr. Scott Fell should read the papers. So
should the police. The lecture was advertised
to be delivered on Sept. 7, at the Playbox,
11 Rowe-street. And there it was duly given
to a crowded audience, what time the posse
of sleuths were Sherlocking the dark and
empty St. James’s Hall.
“Abbot P.”: “Luthier” (B. 18/9/’24)
states that fiddle-maker Devereux’s atelier
was “in Collins-lane, a little above How-
gate’s Rainbow Tavern.” I’ll wager that
Devereux never worked anywhere but in
Marion-street, Fitzroy, where he lived from
1567 to about the beginning of the ’eighties,
when he faded out of the business. It was
not in old John’s nature to go into the city
to work when he could down lools when-
ever he felt disposed and toddle along to the
La Trobe Hotel in Palmer-streer, there to
foregather with Kraft, the decorative painter,
Dick Ramsden and other cronies. Forty
years back Browm and Son had an instru-
ment-repairing shop in the neighborhood that
“Luthier” mentions. They were afterwards
in Swanston-street, a couple of doors from
L. F. Collins’s music-shop.
“D.D.”: A mediocre young actor got him-
self engaged to his landlady’s daughter in
a Melbourne boarding-house. The act-or was
extremely good to look upon, and the young
lady was violently enamored. One night
when at the theatre seeing her beloved act,
she interpreted a burst of applause as all
for her boy, and in her excitement aed en-
thusiasm arose and addressed the ai dience
at large. “Oh, but you should see Arthur
as Romeo!” she said.
“House Bill”: “Second Murderer” (B.
25/9/’24) is wrong re first production of
“The Mikado” at T.R., Melbourne. Boyle
was not the tenor. Nanki Poo was played
on that great night by W. H. Woodfield.
Others in the cast: Edw r in Kelly, John Forde,
Howard Vernon, Nellie Stewart, Ida Osborne,
Lily Forde. Most of them had just finished
a season of opera at the old Princess’s.
“Philm Up”: The British film censor has
banned the newest D. W. Griffith “master-
piece,” “America, or Love and Sacrifice,”
which deals with the American War of In-
dependence. In explaining his interdict, the
official states that “the bias is strongly anti-
British throughout,” and that “the film is
calculated to engender unfriendly feelings
between the two countries.” So, much to
his surprise, the Yankee propagandist gets
a set-back for once.
“P.P.”: An item most conspicuous on
the programme of amusements for the Aus-
ti'alian Manufacturers’ Exhibition in Mel-
bourne is called Inconsistency. At night
pictures are screened; but so far not a single
Australian film has been presented.
“Hamfat”: It will be 50 years come Christ-
mas since Nellie Stewart (described in the
programme as “Nelly”) appeared as one of
the attendant sprites, Maidenhair and Lark-
spur (the latter was a Miss Wallace) , in'the
panto “Humpty Dumpty, or Harlequin King
Arthur, His Three Sons, the Princess Rose-
leaf, the Knights of the Round Table and
the Fairy of Fern-tree Gully.” The man-
agement was Harwood, Stewart, Hennings
and Coppin. Dampier was stage-manager;
Harry Leston, the Lord Chancellor; Tom
Lewis, Humpty Dumpty; and Maggie Stew-
art, Prince Tol de Rol. It was an English
panto “adapted and .localised by T. Carring-
ion and J. Eville, Esqs.,” and was produced
i n Melbourne.
“Rufus Dawes”: The all-conquering car
has captured Bland Holt; and there was
never a truer lover of the animal on which
optimistic citizens lose money at Randwick
and Flemington than Bland. Now living in
retirement in Melbourne, Bland and Mrs.
Bland were wont to take the air in their
tandem dogcart, which became almost as
familiar a feature of the landscape as it used
to be in Sydney. But the. other day Bland
was seen in Bourke-street in a petrol-buggy,
and when I mentioned the matter to an
old-timer who supported the Holts in “The
Rouseabout’s Revenge” (I think it was that)
he was so overcome with emotion that I had
to buy him another.
“Nom”: Father Maurice O’Reilly, the
priest with a punch from St. John’s, Sydney
Uni., has just published an Australian patri-
otic song, “Queen of the South.” Charles
O’Mara, the baritone who came here some
time ago with the Irish Village co., is sing-
ing it. Another effort of O’Reilly’s was
“Unto the End,” a war-time jingle. It found
its way into N.S.W. Hansard through being
approvingly read by Nationalist Weaver.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Teddy McLean (B.
25/9/’24) had an experience of child per-
formers long before he introduced his own
clever youngsters, Eddie and Decima, to the
boards. For nine years he conducted a juven-
ile troupe about Australia. Teddy came to
this country in IS6O with Charles Poole,
whose repertoire was Shakspearean; then he
joined up with Leopold (subsequently asso-
ciated with the Pollards) as pantomimist
and dancer; and after that he spent seven
years with W. S. Lyster in English and
Italian opera. Followed an 11 years’ en-
gagement as ballet-master at the Sydney
Royal (he played harlequin in all the
pantos.) ; and then he formed the juvenile co.
aforementioned. Teddy’s last panto was a
J.C.W. version of “Sinbad the Sailor,” at
Sydney Royal: Bland Holt was the clown.
Nellie Stewart principal boy, and Dick
Stewmrt had a minor part. McLean died in
1915.
“A.P.”: Why don’t these musicians give us
more British works? Melbourne University
Conservatorium announces a concert, at
which, among other things, the instruments
which constitute an orchestra are to be
demonstrated. It is suggested that the con-
cert will be interesting to adults as well as
children. Agreed. But every item on the
programme is by a foreign composer. And
Melbourne has a so-called British Music
Society Quartet whose offerings arc generally
well-worn examples of Haydn or Mozart. Yet
plenty of ’good chamber music has come to
light between Land’s End and John o’ Groats.
“F-N.W.”: Vaudeville headliners have their
names spelt in electricity at night outside
Melbourne Royal and Tivoli. I was once
honored in that way myself. It was sum-
mer, and the Lancashire hall where I was
employed had relapsed from the all-variety
bill to pictures and a couple of vaudeville
turns. On this particular week a troupe of
monkeys and myself were booked to appear,
and as the monkeys ranked higher in the pro-
fessional world than I did their name was
set up over the fagade of the building. But
during the night a beneficial gale sprang up
and dislodged the letters so rudely that when
the manager had swept up the salvage from
the pavement he found lie had only
enough undamaged letters left to form my

of his lighting apparatus he was somewhat
reluctantly driven to “star” me! So when
the time comes, if I cannot leave wealth to
my prospective grandsons, I can at least
bequeath them an enlargement (colored, is.

Bill!”
“T. 0.1.”: “The Comedy of Errors,” which
Allan Wilkie intends producing at Sydney
Palace, was first staged in Australia at
the Melbourne Royal, during G. V.
Brooke’s management, 1859-60. Brooke
and Henry Edwards were the Antipholi;
Harry Jackson and J. L. Sefton the Dro-
mios; Fanny Morgan and Fanny Young
the Wives of the Antipholi; Mrs. Guerin
the Abbess, and Henry Creswiek the Duke.
Later it was played with a change of cast.
SIC TRANSIT GLORIA FOOTSCR’Y.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
"But with all their assiduous gagging the absolute
prime joke that has stood the test of years was
missed. No one spoke of Footscray.” —Sundry Shows.
Palmyra’s splendors are no more
And stately Troy is gone,
’Tis but in half-forgotten lore
One reads of Babylon ;
Time, like an interfering clow’ll,
Upon their stage too soon rang down
Oblivion’s curtain grey;
And now his sacrilegious whim,
To rob our humor of its vim,
Would with a pall of silence dim
The lustre of Footscray.
That name was once the wing you chose
Past trifling jests to soar;
You uttered it and held your nose—
Quick came the joyous roar;
Though twins might miss and kittens fail
And even ma-in-law grow stale,
It never went astray;
For, like immortal Falstaff, it
Was witty and the cause of wit.
What vapid joke would moderns pit
Against superb Footscray?
Disdaining those vagaries crude
That drop from lesser lips,
Some mummer Marius may brood
Amid his ruined quips,
And sadly think, with clouded brow:
“Lo, anything may happen now
Since there has come a day
When vaudevillains duly met
The appetite for mirth to whet
Can gag of Melbourne and forget
To mention good old ’Scray!”

An Absolute Certainty
for the Spring Meeting.
An Open Letter to the Racegoers of Australia.
GENTLEMEN,
Don’t think this is a sermon. I’m not preaching to you. The fact that I happen to be Chairman of a Racing Club (The
Brisbane Amateur Turf Club) is sufficient evidence that what I am going to say to you is not actuated by any spirit of opposition
to Horse Racing as a pastime, nor from any narrow prejudice against the hundreds of thousands in Australia who, like myself,
regularly enjoy the “Sport of Kings.”
Will you take a TIP from me—one that will put you on the road to solid wealth and a happy and independent old age?
Of course you will, but before I give you the name of the horse, what do you say if you and I sort of “take stock of ourselves”
without any camouflage?
ALL OUR EGGS IN THE ONE BASKET.
Now, we Australians “spin” up far too much money on racecourses—l mean that far too many of us repeatedly risk our all
there on exceedingly doubtful speculations and do not keep any of our surplus cash for the “solid” type of investment.
Honestly, man to man, how many of you have made a profit out of “punting”? Can you definitely name one person of
your acquaintance who has made money out of it? I myself have asked hundreds of friends this question. Strangely enough,
90 per cent, of them have quickly answered, “What about Eric Connelley?” On pointing out, however, that Mr. Connelley was
NOT an acquaintance of theirs and that they were merely speaking from “hearsay,” they have all had to admit that they' could
not name a single racegoer friend who had made a profit over a period out of backing racehorses.
WE ALL GO THE SAME WAY HOME.
How many times have you gone out and lost £5, £lO, £l5 or £2O, and yet had your wife asked you for a gift of that much
before you went out you would havp fainted on the spot? How many times have you gone out with a soul full of hope and gone
back home in the gloaming “stone motherless,” footsore and weary, tired, hot, hungry and bad tempered? How many times have you
gone out with the “right oil,” almost the whole programme picked, and yet come home a loser because of listening to the well-meant
but badly-advised counsel of other racegoers.
THE TROUBLES OF THE HEROIC PUNTER.
How many times have you consistently backed a certain horse while it was losing race after race, and then when you finally
discarded it, “home it rolled” at any old price? How many times have you found yourself minus most of your day’s capital before
the last race, and then, instead of backing the “sure looking” 6/4 favorite and saving at least a little from the wreck, you murmur.
“Oh, well, in for a penny, in for a pound,” and on goes your last ten-shilling note on the most likely looking “10 to 1 shot,” which
doesn’t get the “kick out” or something, and you go home murmuring that it’s you yourself who ought to get the “kick out”?
How many times have you backed two horses in the one race—a little on one on the Tote and a lot on the other with the
hooks, only to find that the “toted” one wins and pays 16/6, or some such handsome dividend, while the one backed “straight out”
runs second?
How many times have you backed losing horses down to 4,3 or perhaps 2 to lin a field of, perhaps, 15 or 16? How many
times have you even backed horses at “odds on,” and left your money in?
Do you simply back horses because you love the sport, and don’t care whether you win, or not, or do you fcfct to make
money ?
Of course you do it to make money, but the trouble is you want to make it too quickly. You are not content with backing
two, three or four winners—you “go for the last,” and at teatime the wife goes for YOU. And you keep off the short-priced
winning horses often because you like the big odds. You chuckle when you get 20 to 1 about a horse before a race, when, as a
matter of fact, you ought to have got 200 to 1. A few minutes later you realise that even 2000 to 1 would not have been extravagant
odds.
THE WAY TO MAKE MONEY.
Now, you don’t like laying odds on, do you? But would you lay “16 § to 1 ON” on a horse if you got an absolute parchment
guarantee from the Commonwealth Government that the horse would win, and that you would collect the winnings? Wouldn’t
that be wonderful odds? Seems impossible, doesn’t it? But the fact is that this offer is open to you. I will give you the name of
the horse in a few minutes, but in the meantime just consider the position a little more closely. In order to back this DARK
HORSE that I am talking about, you don’t have to make a “Wild Indian” rush for a crowded tram, and then have to pay the best
part of £1 for the privilege of entering a racecourse to back it. All you have to do is to make your investment in town on, say, a
Saturday morning, and then quietly jog home and spend the afternoon anyhow you like in the bosom of your family.
WILL YOU HAVE A REAL BIG PLUNGE ON MY “TIP”?
Of course you won’t —you never DO put much on the real good things at the racecourse —it’s your bad luck, but I want
you to have a little bit at any rate on this dark horse. (No, it’s not Nigger Minstrel.) Nobody expects that you will stay away
altogether from the races. The Angel Gabriel himself couldn’t persuade the average Australian racegoer that punting doesn’t
pay, but the average Australian, being admittedly the brainiest individual human being on the Earth, will surely agree that it is
good business to put at least a PORTION of his surplus cash on an ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN investment, even if the odds DO
seem a bit short compared with the fabulous racecoui’se odds that so rarely materialise.
A STRAIGHT-OUT TEST.
Probably 250,000 Australians will have a bet on one or other of the events at the forthcoming SPRING MEETING. I
venture to say that fully 240,000 of them will be poorer in everything but experience after the Meeting is over—you know, you
are nearly always poorer yourself.
On the other hand, every man or woman who backs my “tip” will finish up richer—richer in pocket as well as experience.
If you decide to wholly reject my advice, all I ask you to do is to keep this particular newspaper and read this letter again after
the Meeting is over—9s per cent, of you wall then find that every word herein is true —and there will still be time for you to try
backing my “tip” instead.
HERE IS THE “TIP.”
Put just a little of your “punting” money on “LOAN BOND”—in other words, invest portion of your surplus cash in a
Commonwealth Bond in the Loan now being raised by the Federal Government on behalf of the States.
ODDS—I6£ TO 1 ON.
The Loan is being issued at £9B/10/- per £lOO, and the rate of interest is 6 per cent, per annum, which means that you
put on £9B/10/- to win £6, or £l6/8/4 to win £1 —in other words you lay 164 to 1 ON, for an ABSOLUTE GUARANTEE! >
CERTAINTY. And it’s free of State Income Tax, too.
You don’t have to wait until every Saturday to have a bet. You can back “LOAN BOND” any and every day in the week
between now and October 15 next, when the Loan closes.
SHOW ME YOUR WINNINGS AND I’LL SHOW YOU MINE.
Get the habit of putting your money on “Loan Bond,” no matter how small your available cash surplus might be. It will
soon build up. For every hundred racegoers you know of who can't seem to make a profit out of punting, I can show you the
names of a thousand regular Commonwealth Bond buyers who bless the day that we first persuaded them to start investing their
money in this way. For every single racegoer that you can point to as a winner through regular punting, I can rhow you ten
thousand small investors who regularly make money through their Commonwealth Loan Bonds.
“LOAN BOND” ALWAYS PAYS A DIVIDEND.
Of course, you’ve got to wait six months for your first “divvy” from the Government (the interest is paid half-yearly), whereas
the bookmaker doesn’t keep you waiting more than six minutes (the Tote is sometimes a little longer), but the trouble is that the
“bookie” keeps you waiting all your life and longer than that for your winnings on the horses that DON’T win.
GO TO THE SPRING MEETING BY ALL MEANS.
By all means go to the Spring Meeting if you want to—(this is not an ANTI-RACING article), but lay the foundation
of a prosperous and independent future by putting at least A PORTION of your surplus earnings in the BEST OF ALL
AUSTRALIAN INVESTMENTS —viz., a Commonwealth Government Bond. Remember, “LOAN BOND” is the horse that has
never yet been and never will be beaten, and you can back him any day between this and October 15 next, at “161 to 1 ON,” with
an absolute guarantee by the Commonwealth Government that the investment will return an interest yield of £6/6/10 per cent, per
annum over a five-year period, or £6/4/2 per cent, per annum over a ten-year period, free of State Income Tax.
Wishing you every success at the forthcoming Spring Meeting if you go, and guaranteeing you financial success if you don’t.
I am.
Yours faithfully,
Commonwealth £10,300,000 Loan for the States. G. M. DASH.

R.R.D.: So thiu that we mistook it at
first for a politician’s excuse for not doing the right
thing. .. .8.J.A.: Not bad stuff; yet not good be-
cause of frequent descents into commonplace....
N.G.: “IV attle” is not well done even for a child.
. ...H.8.G.: Off our beat—our “brooks” don’t freeze,
and our land doesn’t “lie silent under its shroud of
white". .. .Trevor C.: Its interest isn’t strong enough
to carry its excessive bulk L.S.D. : Poor, all
through.... E.T.T.: It’s not verse: it’s prose cut
into stove lengths.... John B.: No rhyme and less
reason.... Cardigan J.: It struggles along with too
obviously painful an effort P.T.8. : Your nag is
not a lady’s hack; she’ll have to be taught to go
more smoothly than that.... Will V.: That “mur-
muring” in the railway carriage and its consequences
won't wash. . ..A.M.8.8.: Poor little featherweight. ...
H. J.P.: Neither matter nor manner is good enough.
. ...H.G.8.; That sort of thing is too easy, and
far too garrulous for a paper that has to cover a
continent once a week....Charlsoii R.: Curiously
uneven; one or two very good lines, others shock-
ingly bad... .E.J.G.: Pretty weak.... “Blossom’s
Birth” is the best of the bunch Rasmus: Pass-
able ; but the ribald Spring song is becoming almost
as great a nuisance as the other... .O.B.: Nothing
like this was written about the poor Artists’ Ball: —
LEAP-YEAR BALL.
It was with leaps and bounds,
See, see how they’re putting in;
Of colors all could be found
On Murphy’s lovely twins.
Ah, Mike! Ah, yes, they’re out to win,
Their one wish is not to be left;
Maggie, Marjory and Gwin—
It means that we’ll have to graft.
“I say Mall!” "Wa —wat is it, Pat?”
“I—l don’t think I’ll go in.
By gore, I—l’m going if 1 pawn my hat,
As they intend to give us a lively spin.”
“Well, look ’ere Mum—Mall it’s like this:
If they ask me to marry I’m not prepared.”
“What! A chance like this you should never miss.
Why wait till you’re grey-haired ?”
“\V —will you accept, Mall, if one pops?”
"Too right, Pat; and you know it s leap year.”
“Got me thinking—l’m all of a hop.
I—l wish I’d had a few beers.”
. ...S.D.: He “gently bent and kissed her forehead
among just a fewest filaments of straying hair. The
now awed or contented Gwen relapsed into silence.”
Hooray !. .. . Riverina: Only a padded par Lexo:
The reporter of the Evening Bloodstain has been
assassinated. . . .D.S.: Story of Spring pimples season-
able but not suitable... .J.D.: Try elsewhere; you
ought to find a market... .T.A.V.: Lightweight idea
not clearly expressed... .H.C. (Dunedin): Try again
abcut something you know well. Leave the temples
alone. Try to tell us about the Leith, near the Water-
falls. .. .W.W.: “Remorse” sounds more like moral
dyspepsia than poetry. . . .H.F.: You've got a thought,
but the lines need a tonic... .B.F. :■ “The Devil” is
damned. “Morning” much better. .. .R.N.S.: “The
Way of the Peacemaker” seems to have 14 points—
all obscure. .. .A. V.C.: Not too bad; but Parnassus
can take care of itself—the foothills provide quite
good poetic browsing... .8.H.: “Star of Fate” blinks
wickedly at us from the W.P.B L. 8.: Album
verse. Read good poetry, old and modern, for six
months. Then fill your fountain-pen again. ...W.D.F.:
Stories show imagination; but why so gruesome?
. ...N.J.N.: Studies in still life; get them doing
something.. . .W.0.D.: Not usable... .W.S.S.: There’s
material in it for a crisp short story. Too diffuse as
it stands... .D.H.: “Lawks!” as the Marchioness used
to say—what a dismal end !. .. .R.W.J.: “Something
stirred from behind the screen in the corner. It may
have been a groan.” And now the groan (if it was
a groan) will have to stir again... .S.N.M.: Sorry,
but the subject has had all the space we can spare
for it now... .Donald A.: Thanks; and that’s a very
sane letter, too.. ..Seno jo: Fair; but the subject has
worn its boots 0ut....W. Charn: “Kimono” has been
fluttering on the edge, and the lady wasn’t quite
strong enough to bring it in.... Third Son: Words,
words. Not an ounce of real feeling in it. .. .L.F.T.:
Why rake over that ancient muck-heap ?.... Tasma:
But the agriculturist would use lubricating oil,
wouldn’t he? It is brightly written, though....
E.S.H.: “Discipline” is too long, and not very con-
vincing... .Sacra F.: Too much plain bash and blud.
... .Jim G.: Don’t get the point. .. .R.Y.S.: Have
your drink and go; don’t hang around the bar
smacking your lips... .Prickly P.: First, get your
thought clear. Then buy a penn’orth of decent ink.
....Artemus; Ceine down off those stilts. No man
ever talked like that and got an audience twice—
a voluntary one, anyhow... .Walker’s Please: Pity
to waste good work on an impossible subject....
0.8. R.: There is as much poetry in the telephone
directory... .Barney: You lean against too many
corner-posts on the way.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
E.T.: Your sniffy-nosed ladies in pale blue ink
levitating a table are absolutely hopeless... .G.J.W.:
We recognise Bruce by his spats, so the crumpled
object with its face in a handkerchief must be Earle
Page. .. .M.M.: That joke is eligible for the Pioneers’
Club.... J.M.1.: Has possibilities.... J.McA.: As
bald as the skull of a Buddhist priest... .G.R.P.:
Still in the nursery.... F.R.L.: Your dog is what

was thought to keep down any gases that
might otherwise distend the body. The
plate was usually removed before the screw-
ing down. In the. case “Blank File” men-
tions it seems to have been forgotten.

EFRESHING and necessary
as the bath may be, it se-
cures only external clean-
liness, Far more important is
internal cleanliness . For on this
depend health and youthful
energy.
You cannot be healthy if you do
not keep clean internally. A
clogged intestinal system is a
disease-breeder. Here start such
ailments as headaches, bilious
attacks and insomnia—each of
which takes toll of your health
and vitality. Poisons flood your
system and your power of resist-
ance is lowered. Health, even life
itself, is threatened.
In this clogging, say intestinal
specialists, lies the primary cause
of more than three-quarters of all
illness, including the gravest
diseases of life.

TRADE MARK
For Internal Cleanliness
women have learned to prevent
illness by maintaining internal
cleanliness through the regular
use of Nujol. Nujol is not a laxa-
tive. Nujol prevents intestinal
clogging by lubrication, the
method now employed by med-
ical authorities throughout the
world.
Nujol lubricates and softens the
food waste and thus hastens its
passage through and out of the
body.
Don’t give disease a start. Take
Nujol as regularly as you brush
your teeth or wash your face.
Nujol is not a medicine. Like
pure water it is harmless. Nujol
establishes the habit of internal
cleanliness—the healthiest habit
in the world.
If you would maintain health and
youthful energy adopt this habit
of internal cleanliness. Nujol will
make every day brighter/and your
enjoyment of life more keen.
Keep a bottle of Nujol
in the bath room cab-
inet as a daily reminder.

Constipation
Everywhere physicians are sounding
urgent warnings of the growing men-
ace of faulty elimination. In an ad-
dress before a leading Medical Society
recently the medical director of one of
the principal insurance companies
stated that the lowered vitality caused
by faulty elimination made the entire
body a prey to dangerous germs. He
further declared that if the absorp-
tion of poisons from clogged intestines
was stopped, it would largely do away
with the numerous untimely deaths
that occur during middle age.
Why Physicians Favor
Lubrication
Medical science, through knowledge
of the intestinal tract gained by X-
ray observation and exhaustive tests,
has found in lubrication a means of
overcoming faulty elimination. The
gentle lubricant, Nujol, penetrates
and softens the hard food waste.
Thus it enables Nature to secure regu-
lar, thorough elimination. Nujol is
not a laxative and cannot cause dis-
tress. Nujol hastens the rate of flow
of the intestinal stream, preventing
intestinal sluggishness.
Nujol is used in leading hospitals and
is prescribed by physicians through-
out the world for the relief of faulty
elimination in people of all ages.
Complexion Troubles: Science now
knows that poisons from intestinal
sluggishness are the chief cause of
personal unattractiveness. Carried
by the blood they reach every body
cell the millions of cells that compose
the skin, the roots of the hair and the
eyes. No wonder that through faulty
elimination the skin becomes sallow,
muddy, roughened, blotched or dis-
figured with pimples or other blem-
ishes. It is not strange that the hair
loses its sheen and the eyes become
dull,
Nujol should be taken regularly for
the complexion. Nujol overcomes
and prevents intestinal sluggishness.
It thus keeps the body free from
poisons which are the principal cause
of complexion troubles.
Nujol is the most effective aid to a
clear, healthy, lovely skin.
Elderly People: In youth and perfect
health the intestine supplies a natural
lubricating liquid in sufficient quan-
tity to soften the food waste and
hasten its movement out of the body.
In advanced years this lubricant de-
creases in quantity. Hence the need
for something to give assistance. The
action of Nujol so closely resembles
that of Nature’s lubricant that it is
especially beneficial to those in ad-
vanced years. Nujol softens the
waste, thus enabling the intestinal
muscles to move it along and
- out of the body. _

“Van Cat": Tin Lizzies are subject to
many disorders, but this case has no parallel.
It happened during the outbreak of rinder-
pest among the cattle at Spearwood (W.A.).
The accounts for losses were being dealt
with, and in one of the bills an unspecified
amount of £8 3s. was found. An inspector
was sent to inquire, and he was told that
during the period of infection this farmer's
Ford developed strange complaints, and the
owner felt that under the circumstances he
should get compensation. The inspector, who
had a sense of humor, remarked that if the
car really had rinderpest it ought to be burnt
the same as the cows. If, then, the owner
would burn the car, the question of compen-
sation would be considered on its merits.
“Jesmond" : It is useless advising house-
wives to bake their own bread while there
is no commercial yeast on the Australian
market. Very few will bother mussing about
with ferments now on sale, as it is more
trouble to get these to “work” than to do the
actual baking. In England and America
nearly all grocers sell yeast like half-dried
putty which requires no setting or prelimi-
nary working; it is mixed with the dough
at once, and the bread is out of the oven
a few hours later. We have plenty of
breweries: why can’t we have the advantage
of compressed yeast?
“S.T.S.” : On the lower Murray they tell
you the story of O’Rafferty’s drink. O'Raf-
ferty had got in early with a large area under
fruit-trees. The district hung lire for some
years; then the soldiers returned, and prices
soared. Came a day when O’Rafferty was
offered £15,000 for his big holding. The
good fellow declined; he was fond of hard
work, also he knew his own weakness. “I
should only drink it all,” he said. Of course
lie just meant that no occupation and un-
limited money would be his ruin; but the
£15,000 drink caught the popular fancy and
has become a local proverb.
“Fana”: The building of the cross-country
line to Broken Hill may open up new sources
of wealth in the form of chemical deposits.
Most of these consist of borax and similar
compounds, for which there is always a fair
industrial demand, most of Australia’s sup-
plies now being imported. At present the
working of the deposits is out of the ques-
tion. but with railway transport available
they may become profitable. Already small
syndicates are being formed to give various
ventures a fly.

"Sax”: Housewives in Melbourne lament
the exit of Jumbunna coal. Apart from
boxwood, which is getting poorer and dearer
each year and needs frequent stoking, the
good Victorian reckons Jumbunna the only
satisfactory stove fuel. And prospects are
not bright; for though brown-coal briquettes
will be available presently, being flameless
they will probably be useless by themselves
as one-fire stove fuel. The closing of the
mine after a 30 years’ struggle is attributed
to labor troubles; but had there been a more
easily worked seam Jumbunna would still
be running.
* * * #
"Nitric ’: I must disillusionise “Cen-
turion,” who states that the springs of
Muckadilla (C.Q.) contain radio-active ele-
ments. It certainly has been averred that
the. medicinal qualities of some mineral
springs or “cure waters” are due to the
presence of radium in small quantities, but
Muckadilla is not in that group. The chemi-
cal constituents of Muckadilla bore water
are silica, 3 p.c.; iron and alumina, .5 p.c.;
calcium carbonate, 3.3 p.c.; magnesium car-
bonate, 1.51 p.c.; sodium carbonate, 15.99
p.c.; sodium chloride, 6.9 p.c.; sodium sul-
phate, 1.55 p.c.
* * * *
“Sturt”: South Aus. announces with
modest pride that its vintage for the past
season was nearly lOf million gallons of
wine, an increase of more than 2 millions
over last year. But prices are down, and
the. value is only £805,000, as against
£860,000 last time and close on a million
for a much smaller yield in 1921. South
Aus. does not take a winemaker seriously
now unless his output is over 1000 gallons.
There are 74 doing that or more.
“Wingella” : On behalf of the new settlers
in the N.T., the Board in control purchased
a peanut huller, erected it at Darwin, and
invited settlers to send their peanuts to
be cleaned for export. The machine hulled
the nuts, certainly, but also crushed the
kernels into a worthless mass. Then some
unpleasant person investigated. The machine
sold to the Board as a peanut huller was a
corncracker! The noise you heard just now
was the roar of the settlors as they feed
their horses and pies with the peanuts they
can’t otherwise get rid of.
A BALLAD OF MORTAL DUST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
If we are but of mortal clay
Doomed back to earth to crumble,
Why in the glory of our day
Should we for that be humble?
The crystal goblet, shapen fine,
Broken the earth may bury,
But while it holds enough of wine
It makes the dull heart merry.
So should we wet this fine-shaped earth,
That God with sense has gifted,
With all the wines that give us mirth,
And keep the soul uplifted
To feel the beauty of each scene,
Like us, of dust compounded—
Use to its best the time between
Our morn and evening bounded.
About the world the dust may blow
Of heroes famed in story ;
But they have known the joys we know,
And had their hour of glory.
Their clay perchance the grape has fed
That now our cup is filling
With wine whose power, whose beauty red,
Both heart and eye are thrilling.
Whilst in its gloom the dull mind delves,
Take life with spirit lusty ;
As long as we’re not dust ourselves,
The world is “not too dusty.”
VICTORIA.

“0.P.H.”; Palmerston once smilingly
quoted the authority of an eminent physi-
cian that continuance in office was good for
the health. When asked if activity in Oppo-
sition wouldn’t do as well, he replied that
it wouldn't, as that stirred up the bile and
created acidity. I recalled this the other
day when I heard Vie. Opposition-leader
Peacock testily accuse Prendergast of “slim”
tactics in coming down to the House and
asking for £l2OO for the Police Strike Com-
mission after he had got £lOO the previous
week. (The £lOO was of course only the first
low hedge that he had led a careless Mouse
over.) Prendergast grinned as the House,
on the voices, passed the £l2OO. He, too,
knows, all about biliousness. He led the
Opposition for 17 years.
The Hibernians of Adelaide received a
shock recently when their president, a pro-
mising young solicitor, proposed that the
name of the society be changed from “Hiber-
nian” to “Australian.” Of course the motion
was lost, though no good argument was
brought against it. The society is an ordi-
nary “benefit” body, very like a score of
others. It admits any nationality (only
recently a man of Polish extraction became
a member) ; nine out of every ten of its
members have never seen Ireland, and all
the contributions that support it are earned
in Australia, by men who (with few excep-
tions) will never see any other country.
Yet when its president suggested an Aus-
tralian name for the society he was made
aware that he had committed sacrilege.
Two decisions of Melbourne courts have
supplied ammunition for the Greater Mel-
bourne municipal movement, which would
mean a new Act with extended powers. The
Richmond Council refused to allow a certain
projected factory to be erected in a residen-
tial area, but the Full Court held that, whilst
it had power to regulate certain trades, it
had no power to prohibit them in any area.
The other decision was one against the Essen-
don Council, which has discovered on the
best judicial authority that, though it may
claim a say in the material used in the con-
struction of a building, it has none regarding
the purpose of the building. So one council
lias protestingly withdrawn its objections to
a tar-distilling plant on the Yarra, although
the works are going to interfere with the
council's plans to make that drain pic-
turesque.
Will Lawson, from the U.S.A.:—
Many records of early San Francisco shipping were
destroyed in the fire of 1906, but there are still old
seafaring men—l have met some of them —who
can recall the beginnings of the mailboat services
between Sydney and San Francisco, when the paddle-
steamers Nevada and Nebraska ran across the Pacific.
Vessels better remembered in ’Frisco are the Cities
of New York, Washington, Sydney and San Fran-
cisco. Among the first ocean screw-steamers built
in America, they were launched at Chester (Penn.)
in 1875. An ex-purser of the City of Sydney told
me that it was the happiest run a man could desire.
The mail contract provided that there must always
be a vessel in port, so 40 days were spent in
Sydney, 16 in ’Frisco and 66 at sea. But the
crew found the extended shore leave very expensive—
at least, the girls came expensive; grog was cheap
in those days. The City of Sydney is now a five-
masted barquentine engaged in carrying lumber on
the Pacific coast, and she sails like a witch.
Au official report has been presented to
the Vic. Government recommending that
schools of weaving be established. It is
doubtful whether we are suffering so much
from a lack of knowledge of weaving as from
a surplus of various things that make costs
outrageously high. The Australian woollen
industry isn’t really started yet: it is merely
hanging around. We are not supplying one
quarter even of our own woollen require-
ments ; we ought to be supplying all our
own and more than one quarter of the
woollen requirements of Britain. The Vic.
Labor Government might get another re-
port explaining why these things are so.
Incidentally, it would, of course, ascertain
whether there is much to learn in con-
nection with modern weaving machines, and
whether the absence of the talked-of schools
isn’t a mere cloak to hide other things.
“Ack”: “Piriti’s” tale of the destructive
5.9 shell (B. 4/9/’24) makes me remember one
which, though no man was hit, wiped out a
whole line of horses. It was just after morn-
ing stables, and the horses were feeding
quietly in the bed of a deep wadi running
down to the Jordan River, when a shell from
“Jericho Jane” (captured in the last big
drive by Ryrie’s Brigade) exploded on the
farther bank, the “blow-back” sweeping the
line from end to end. There were 22 horses
tethered to the ground cable, and not one
escaped bad wounds. Some that were not
killed outright broke their ropes and galloped
away in panic. One poor beast had both hind
legs blown off below the hocks, and was
standing pathetically on the shattered
stumps. Shrapnel pellets had cleanly picked
both eyes out of one big Clydesdale, . touch-
ing him nowhere else, and the animal was
still feeding when the farrier-sergeant put
him out of his misery. None of the drivers
were hurt, though they were breakfasting
right on the end of the horseline.
“Schnorrer” : There has been an upheaval
in London Jewry owing to the marriage of
a Rothschild to a Christian in a. fashionable
Anglican church. The lady is a daughter
of Major Behrens, a Jew of wealth and con-
sequence, and her mother called a now-dead
Lord Rothschild father. It was first an-
nounced that the ’groom, Peter Harris, was
to be made a Jew; but he remained a “Goy”
at the time of the ceremony. What mainly
concerns Jewry (although the Rothschildren
have always been strict, and the backsliding
of one of the family is disconcerting) was
the presence at the church of numbers of rich
Jews, many of them prominent in synagogue
affairs, who thus gave countenance to this
“renunciation of Judaism.” There were
notable absentees, however. Lady Roths-
child, the bride’s grandmother, and other
members of the family being among
them. It was subsequently announced
in the Times that the real ceremony had
been performed before the registrar, the sug-
gestion that the church affair was a mere
social formality being designed to soften
the reproach against those Jews who at-
tended. But it hasn’t had that effect; and
Jewry—even in Australia—feels that some-
thing like an earthquake has shaken the
foundations of the synagogue.

The Wind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
TV HERE came a wind from out the
dawn—
A fleet wind, a sweet wind—-
A wind with joy within its wings and laugh-
ter in its voice.
It hurried over lawn and field
By highways and byways, .
And carolled as it onward sped, “Rejoice,
O World, Rejoice!”
The music of its care-free song
Went ringing and swinging
Across the heath, a-down the dale, clear over
hill and plain ; , ,
It swelled through valleys still and deep
Where purling and curling
The dancing streamlets heard the song, and
stole, the gay refrain.
Among the meadow flowers it played;
It bent them and spent them,
And strewed their glowing petals on the fern
and sunburnt grass.
The silent forest trees awoke
To meet it and greet it,
And shook their leaves in ecstasy to feel the
glad wind pass.
Through dingy city streets it swept—
Air fragrant and vagrant—
With song of sunny country lands and
rippled lakes of blue;
The jaded city folk looked up,
As wiling, beguiling,
The wind of wonder whispered low of
meadowsweet and dew.
Adown the river raced the wind;
By reaches and beaches,
It swayed the rustling water-reeds, gold in
their slender grace,
Till dusk had crept above the hills,
And whitely and brightly
The Mistress Moon had set the stars each in
its evening place.
The wind grew tired of revelling,
Of dancing and glancing,
It lagged across the darkened hills and over
plainlands wide;
And when the sunset glow was spent,
Slow homing from roaming,
A weary wind crept back to rest upon the
mountain side.

Transformation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
PETER COLLETT, the policeman’s
son, stood on the bank of the creek,
the look of an outcast dog in his eyes,
as he watched the group of boys below.
There were seven or eight of them, all hostile,
and ever since they had emerged from school
they had been baiting him unmercifully. Now
they wanted to prevent him from crossing
over to old Gorman’s place, where he had dis-
covered a tree of ripe peaches at the back of
the deserted hut. And it was only to _win
their favor that he had told them about it!
“Hunt him home, Don,” said a little fel-
low with a freckled face. “We don’t want
him follerin’ us.”
“He’s a stickybeak,” called out another —
“just like his old man.”
There was a crackle of laughter, and Don
Byett went back a few steps challengingly.
“Clear out of it, Spider,” he ordered.
“We’ve told you before we don’t want you.
Streak home to your mother.”
Peter maintained his ground, though his
face was flushed and his eyes burning like
IIVG CO o.ls
"I found those peaches, didn’t I?” he de-
manded weakly. _
“It don’t matter whether you did or not,
said Don Byett. “If you want some, go and
get your old man to buy them.”
The allusions to his father always brought
a flush of humiliation to Peter’s cheeks. How
could he help his father being different from
theirs!
“Hunt him home, Don,” piped the little
fellow, who was dabbling in the wet clay
of the creek.
A shower of mud suddenly descended on
Peter, one large blob striking him on the
cheek. In a moment he had lost all control
of himself.
“Look out, Don,” yelled one of the boys
below. “He’s picked up a stone!”
Bracing himself against a tree, Peter was
facing his tormentors with a trembling des-
peration. AH he had suffered at their hands
was passing through liis mind in a fiery rush
of memories—the maulings in the playground,
the sniggers behind his back at school, the
jokes about his father’s feet. It had gone
on for months —all his life, it seemed. Even
in sleep he was haunted by that circle of
malicious faces, and now that he was keyed
up he felt that he could wipe them all out
with one shattering blow.
“Keep back!” he cried in a shrill voice to
the boy who was advancing on him. “Keep
back or I’ll smash you, Don Byett."
With his tense fingers he was gripping the
stone so tightly that it cut into his flesh, and
bis hot eyes were fixed on the other boy s
face. Don Byett stopped, and his mouth
fell open in a taunting grin.
“Go on,” he challenged. “Throw it,
Spider ! You’re not game !”
The boys by the creek had suddenly become
silent and were watching with absorbed in-
terest. Further down the bank a party of
little girls had come to a halt, and were
watching, too.
“It’s Spider Collett,” Peter heard one of
them say. “They’re hunting him home.”
And they giggled with subdued excitement
as they stood swinging their schoolbags.
“Go on!” Don Byett repeated. “Throw it,
Spider! Ar —you haven't got the pluck.”
It was true enough. Peter felt the pas-
sion that had given him strength ooze away
mysteriously, and in place of it came a weak
impulse to burst into tears. The world was
spinning round him, a world of hot faces and
implacable eyes. Suddenly throwing down
the stone he turned his back and made his
way up the bank, his knees weak beneath
him, and his new boots slipping on the grass.
Immediately there sounded out a clamor of
whistles and cat-calls from the bed of the
creek, and derisive voices advised him to go
home and tell his father. It was the half-
heard comments of the little girls that hurt
him most, though. He trailed back over the
reserve, crying to himself softly with rage and
humiliation. How could he face thep all
again on Monday morning V He simply
couldn’t! Clambering over the rails of the
saleyartf he made his way home across a
vacant allotment, feeling he would die if he
didn't get away from this township where
everyone lmted him for no reason at all.
At tea that night his mother, watching him
nibbling at his food, said suddenly :
“You’re not well, Peter. Whatever s
come over yoti? You’d better go to bed as
soon as tea’s over and leave your lessons till
to-morrow nigjht.”
“I’m all right,” he mumbled. ‘ Its just
that I’m not hungry.” , , , u ,
He did nob want to go to bed, for that
meant lving afcvake in the little room at the
end of the veaandah and living through the
incident of th*3 afternoon again and again.
His ears still vibrated with the whistles and
catv-calls that Had followed him up the bank,
and everywhere she looked he could see Don
Byefct’s grinning* face, with its wide mouth
aiid pugnacious e.tyes. It mocked at him from
the photographs on the mantelpiece, from
behind the door, and from the shadows be-
yond the circle of lamplight.
“WaiPtill Monday morning,” he could hear
a voice sWv. “You, wait!”
And he thought of the bleak, gravelled
playground, with tfie dusty cricket-pitch in
the corner, and the*, little knot of boys who
would be gathered under the pepper-tree
watching for his approach. He had always
hated Monday mp ratings. The two days at
the week-end wdre brightly-colored, and he
could amuse himself' playing about the yard,
but when he awoke on Monday there was a
harshness in the Mery air. This time the
return to school! wQuild be worse than ever.
Yet he could ntft get any relief by telling
his mother all about it. Once or twice lie
had tried, but she had merely ruffled his
hair and told him he mustn’t mind being
teased a little.
“If the other bt>ys are too rough with
you you must tell the teacher, ’ she said.
“Mr. Duncan would n't let them knock you
about. He knows you’re not strong.”
Her lack of understanding made him feel
that the little world he lived in was remote
and friendless. His father was even less
able to comprehend it than his mother. Ho
did not know that boys called him Old
Beetle-crusher, and th at when he was pacing
about the station in his uniform, waiting
for the evening train, they hid behind the
goods-shed and mocke d him, or asked who
killed the half-caste who had died in tin*
lock-up two years before. If he had known
these things he would only have laughed and
treated it as a jpke. He was that sort of
man.
That night Peter Jay awake wondering
how he could escape from the ring of tormen-
tors that hemmed liim :in. He had done no-
thing to deserve all tikis. It wasn’t true
that he had told the* teacher about Don Byett
and some of the otlfcrs smoking roots in the
bottom of the gully! It wasn’t true that
he stayed behind atfter school to crawl to
Mr. Duncan ! And it his father had arrested
old Harvey at the station for being drunk
that wasn’t his fault, any more than the
fact that he had thin Uegs !
If only he could medlt them all singly, with
no one looking. Therfe was little Ted Har-
vey, the freckle-faced boy, who had thrown
mud at him, for instance —a fat, panting
youngster whose nose bled at the slightest
touch. He imagined meeting him down in
the bed of the creek and sending him home
howling to his mother. Even Don Byett, the
leader of the mob—he wouMn’t be afraid of
meeting Don Byett on equal terms, even
though he was a year older. He found
comfort in picturing a series of encounters
from which he emerged triumphant, so that
no one dared to call him Spider again, and
even the little girfs regarded him with admira-
tion and awe.
But when he iell asleep he found himself
back among the oflfl tragedies, the torment and
humiliation intensified by his dreaming brain.
He was a dog, atnd they had broken one of
his front legs so that he couldn’t get away
from them. Damcing around him they led
him up the street with a string of tin-cans
tied to bis tail, and people leant over their
fences to laugh at the spectacle. What was
worse, he saw his own father stop just out-
side the store and laugh, too. It was that
made his heart svMell with bitterness till he
thought it would burst, and he woke up
whimpering.
“Dad!” he found himself saying. Its
not fair!”
For a while he lay still, racked by the
emotions of his dream, till he became sud-
denly aware that something was going on
in the house. His mother came down the
verandah carrying a lamp, and through the
open door he saw her stop at the head of
the steps and stare out into the night. The
glow of light shone on her grey dressing-
gown, her tangled hair, her sallow face, and
made her look ghostly. Peter started up
in bed.
“Mum!” he called out. “What’s wrong?
Where’s dad gone?”
She came to his room reassuringly.
"I didn’t know you were awake, Peter.
Lie down now and go to sleep again, like a
good bov. Your father’s had to go out.
They’re ’looking for Mrs. Byett’s little boy,
and they’re afraid there’s been an accident.”
“An ‘ accident!” he repeated vaguely.
“What, not Don Byett?"
“The one who used to bring the milk.”

with his brother’s gun. Don’t worry about
it now. though. We can’t do anything.
Lie down again and go to sleep."
She smoothed his pillow and then dis-
appeared with the light, but Peter could not
get to sleep. His mind was muddy and con-
fused. but he was acutely conscious that
something had happened, something that
might shatter the nightmare that overhung
his days and nights. He could see pictures
in the dark, the strip of creek with low banks
that ran through the bottom of Byett’s pad-
dock. and little groups of men blundering
about with storm-lanterns. He could even
imagine he heard them calling; but he could
not see Don Byett’s face except with the
taunting grin it had worn the afternoon
before. „ , J ,
In the morning he felt a strange hush
about the house as he dressed. Although

“Every Picture
Tells a Story'
What
causes
Aching Joints?
Much of the pain attributed to rheumatism is
really due to an excess of uric acid in the blood
caused by weak kidneys.
When excess uric acid col-
lects in the blood it forms
jagged crystals, which are de-
posited in the muscles, joints,
along the walls of the arteries,
and in the sheaths of nerves.
The movement of a nerve or
muscle that contains these uric-
acid crystals causes sharp, in-
tense, darting pains, and in time
starts swelling and inflammation
of the joints.
The moment you feel any
rheumatic pains—any twinges
or uneasiness in the back—any
sign of urinary irregularity, be-
gin with Doan’s Backache Kid-
ney Pills. This medicine aids
the kidneys to filter excess uric
acid out of the blood, and has
been winning successes for over
fifty years.
SERIOUS KIDNEY TROUBLE
CURED.
Mrs. F. Schroder, Oberon Cottage, 14
Oberon Street, Randwick, Sydney, says:
“For a good while a member of my
family suffered from rheumatism and
backache. The pain was often so severe
that it was torture to move about,
especially stooping. We felt sure the
kidneys were not working properly, as
there were several other marked symp-
toms noticeable, but backache and rheu-
matism were by far the most painful.
One day Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
were recommended to us, so I sent for
some, and I am pleased to tell you
they acted splendidly, three bottles
making a complete cure. Some years
have elapsed since then, but there has
been no return of the trouble, £o we
feel safe in saying the cure is a perma-
nent one.”
Six years later, Mrs. Schroder says:
“The cure referred to still holds good,
a fact that speaks volumes for Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills. They are a
splendid kidney medicine and will
always have our hearty recommenda-
tion.”
Sold at 2/9 per bottle at all
Chemists and Stores, or from

Street, Sydney.

TWO RESIDENTS OF SYDNEY CURED OF
PILES BY DOAN’S OINTMENT.
A KENSINGTON CASE.
Mr. Joseph Abrahams, senior, No. 29
Anzac Parade, Kensington, Sydney,
says: “For years I was tortured with
itching piles. The irritation of this ail-
ment is terrible, and only those who
have suffered know how awful it is. I
used dozens of pile remedies, but could
not get anything to give me ease. A
friend urged me to try Doan’s Oint-
ment, saying he was sure this prepara-
tion would cure me. I got some and
commenced using it, and in a very short
time I was completely cured.”
Nine years later Mr. Abrahams says:
“I have not been troubled with Piles
since Doan’s Ointment cured me over
nine years ago. I have advised many
sufferers to use this grand remedy, and
I am sure it will cure in every case if
people will only apply it properly.”
AN UNDERCLIFFE CASE.
Mr. F. W. Martin, Homer Street.
Undercliffe, Sydney, says: “For about
12 months I was tortured with Itching
Piles, and the pain and irritation nearly
drove me mad. I consulted a doctor,
and used Pile remedies, but could not
get permanent relief. I heard that
Doan's Ointment was good, and decided
to try it. After a few applications I
felt better, and by the time the third
pot was finished I was perfectly cured.
t advise all those who suffer with Piles
to use Doan’s Ointment, as I am sure
they will benefit by it.”
Eleven years later Mr. Martin says:
“Eleven years ago I told you Doan s
Ointment had cured me of Piles. I
cap now add that my cure has lasted,
for I am still free of this torturing
ailment. I always keep Doan’s Oint-
ment in the house, and use it occasion-
ally, just as a preventive against any
return.”
SOLD BY ALL CHEMISTS AND STORES AT 2/9 PER TIN.
it was long after daylight his father was still
asleep in the front room, and the movements
of his mother about the kitchen were soft
and mouse-like. When he went out she was
bending over the fire, and as soon as she
looked up at him he knew that there was
tragedy in the air. _ . t
“Come here, Peter,” she said quietly. Ive
got something very sad to tell you. _ S-s-h .
We mustn't wake your father. He s been
out all night.”
Dazed and awestricken, the boy listened
dumbly while she told about the finding of
Don Byett in the bed of the creek just out-
side the paddock. His gun had gone oft, it
seemed, while he was getting through the
wire-fence, and badly wounded though he
was he had tried to crawl home, but had been
unable to climb the bank. After they found
him he had only lived long enough to tell
them how it happened, and it was nearly
daylight before they had brought him to the
house.
“That poor woman, Peter !” Peter s mother
kept repeating. “It’s her I feel for most.
Thank God, I never let your father bring
a gun inside this house!”
She had her arm around his shoulder as
if she expected him to break down, but in-
stead of showing any emotion he stood stiff
and silent, wrapped in a dream. It was
terrible, he felt, but unreal. His mind was
numbed and refused to act. All he could
feel was a sort of dull shock, and he did not
even ask himself whether he had wanted
anything to happen to Don Byett. No; all
this was a dream from which he would soon
wake!
He went out into the yard and stared
at the carrier’s draught-horses in the paddock
below, at the tall gumtree in the reserve,
at the hawks hovering over the saleyards.
The quiet morning sunlight lay over every-
thing, and it seemed as if all the familiar
sounds were muffled a little. He was dimly
conscious that the world had changed. Yet
he saw it through a haze: nothing was sharp
oi* clear.
“You can go over to Byett’s in the after-
noon,” his mother told him. “I’ll probably
go, too, to see if there’s anything I can do.
All the children will be there to have a last
look at their playmate.”
It was two years since Peter had been in
the shingle-roofed house that was hidden
in an orchard of straggling orange-trees and
flanked by a series of yards. He was awed
by the hush that surrounded it, and he felt
that he was walking up the aisle of a church
as he made his way along the path with his
mother. There were a few horses tied to
the fence, and near a shed at the back a
couple of men were examining a broken gun.
Don’s elder brother, he heard the children
say afterwards, had smashed it in two pieces
when they brought it home.
Yet nothing was real to Peter till he stood
in the room where the dead boy lay, his face
looking waxen and unfamiliar, and his body
small and shrunken under the white sheet.
The queer hardness that had held Peter in
a trance all morning began to dissolve. This
was not the Don who had always taken the
lead in persecuting him; this was someone
at once stranger and more intimate. The
scene of the afternoon before was blotted out.
In. its place came a vision of Don crawling
along the creek-bed in the dark, dragging his
gun behind him and calling for help. His
shoulders began to heave convulsively; he
wanted to answer that call. He had an im-
pulse to throw himself down by the side
of the bed and give way to a wild outburst
of emotion.
“Don and your little boy were such mates,”
he heard Mrs. Byett say to his mother. “He
was always talking of Peter. Nothing will
ever be the same again-—nothing!”
The last phrase kept repeating itself in
Peter’s brain when he stood on the verandah
outside, talking in a half-whisper to some
of the other boys. It was true ! The world
was transformed, and all the people in it!
The sunlight lay softly on the green pad-
docks sloping to the creek, on the ripening
oranges, on the tin roofs in the distance.
And the other boys were subdued and
friendly, treating him as one of themselves.
There was no harshness anywhere, not even
in the thought of going back to school on
Monday morning.
VANCE PALMER.
The Struggle.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE rotting window of the deserted cot-
tage offered no difficulty to Curtis.
The reason for his caution as he low-
ered himself in was that he mistrusted the
flooring. His outstretched hand, feeling into
the shadows, made out a doorway. Through
this he passed, so intent on exploration that
his surprise was sickening when out of the
intense shadows something leapt upon him,
and he crashed down with a heavy antagonist
on his chest.
For at least two minutes there was no time
for thought. Every action was instinctive;
and Curtis, his heart beating with fear,
struggled desperately to heave his attacker
off, or, failing that, to frustrate the movement
of the arms, which he felt were reaching for
deadly holds. As they twisted and panted,
Curtis locked his enemy’s left arm, which
was seeking a better purchase on his neck,
with his elbow, got a grip on the other hand,
which had been stealing towards his throat,
and held desperately. And so they writhed
furiously until they came to a breathless
pause.
In the darkness Curtis could see nothing.
His enemy showed no outline against the
pitch-blackness; yet, by the feel of him, and
a judgment of the weight that was pressing
him down, he knew, directly he could think
for a moment, who his opponent was. It
was undoubtedly the big, yellow-faced man
with the scar above his eye whom he had
seen almost daily of late, and whose furtive
manner and apparent desire to avoid observa-
tion had drawn attention to a face in itself
repulsive and sinister. A negro quarter-
blood he judged, wondering, when his atten-
tion had been drawn to him, what he was
doing in that far-north Queensland township.
When his crash had come in Brisbane, Cur-
tis had cleared out. He had gone north with
what money he could secure, with the idea
that in new places there might be some ven-
ture waiting w T hich would put him on his feet
again. This optimistic fancy had come to
him so strongly that, when he left, his only
intimation to Lucy had been a brief message
that he had been called away and would be
back in three or four months.
Lucy meant so much to him that, as time
passed in disappointment, the knowledge of
that inadequate explanation of his absence
created a sort of frenzy in him. The North
had brought him nothing but despair. His re-
sources had gradually vanished, and to-night
he had come to this deserted shack because
his debt at the hotel made him ashamed to
face the landlord again.
His intention had been to sleep somehow
that night and wake in the morning to give
life one more trial. If nothing came he
would make an end of himself. He could, of
course, go sundowning ; but that presented the
tragedy of a finish, too —-the finish to his
hope of returning again to his old life, and
to Lucy. Suicide was preferable.
And now the decision seemed to be taken
out of his hands. Surprised as he was by
the attack which lacked all explanation, he
knew that there was murderous intention in
it. Hopeless his life might be, but the idea
of dying in this way was intolerable.
A renewed tension in his enemy’s muscles
telegraphed the approach of a fresh effort.
He stirred his cracking arms in response, and
in the clash of their energies their bodies
heaved upwards, to bump back heavily. He
felt the sudden splinter of rotten wood, and
found himself falling in a tangle of timber.
The floor,' rotten with age, had crumbled
beneath them. But, although the fall seemed
to occupy an eternity, it was only a drop of
a few feet before he landed on sand, his an-
tagonist still on top. Taking advantage of
the fall, he made a desperate effort to heave
his enemy off, and desperately plugged his
fist into tlie face he now saw above him, feel-
ing the other’s grip relax slightly as the blow
told. lie heaved again, and actually rolled
his man over and over, but in the end found
himself still underneath, the mastery in his
opponent’s hands.
But here under the old shanty there was
dim light, apparently stealing in between the
piers on which the shanty stood, through
closed sides ; and Curtis could smell the tang
of rotting seaweed, and hear the lisp of the
waves moving amongst it. He could now see
the dark outlines of liis' opponent upon him,
the gleam of the sweat on his face and the
glitter of his eyes.
Resistance had become so painful, the
ache upon his strained muscles such an
agony, that for a moment it had appealed
to him as comparatively easy to welcome
death by relaxing his resistance. Then a
surge of revolt had filled him. He, whose
forefathers had been masters of men, to
be done to death by a nigger, a descendant
of slaves whose ancestors had cringed be-
neath the lash! With some vague idea of
mind-mastery he looked into the eyes of his
enemy with all the disdain he could express.
He saw the quadroon’s eyes blink, and then
the big man got a twist on his arm which
tortured him.
“Stop that, damn you!” he cried sharply,
disguising the pain under anger.
It was an order—a command to an im-
placable enemy to relax a triumphant
hold ; yet Curtis’s heart gave a leap, for, as
if involuntarily, the other’s grip did relax.
As Curtis hastened to secure his arm frqm
a repetition of it, a surge of triumph came
to him. Behind the inferiority of his physi-
cal strength he had stumbled upon an ele-
ment of superiority—the superiority of the
white will. But _ would even that be suffi-
cient to bring him through a struggle in
which all else was against him?
He concentrated liis look afresh on the
glitter of the eyes before him, trying to con-
ceal any sign of the inward terror that
nauseated him; but that terror was aug-
mented when he felt the negro whirl his
hand away towards his thigh and bring it
back again. Desperately he met and caught
the hand in a frantic grip. He sensed rather
a™ saw eam °f the quadroon’s knife.
Put down that knife!” he said sharply.
It was just a chance that here, too, his will
might win. It seemed as if eternity marked
time: the sound of the lap of the waves
was like the counting off of hours And
then a fresh feeling of triumph came. If
the quadroon did not obey, he at least held
his hand, when a sharp twist might have
released the white man’s arm and sent the
knife into his side.
1 sa y •” Curtis’s stare held eyes
that blinked before it.
“I can kill you,” said the quadroon; and in
the mere statement the white man sensed a
weakening, a desire to compromise with his
first murderous intention.
“Kill me, then !” he taunted. “Much good
it will do you !”
He felt that he had all but won the
struggle for his life when his enemy made no
new effort; and, even with his fear that
some slip might occur which would mean
his death, he felt exultation—a glory in a
masterful ancestry, which had given him
spiritual power over this descendant of
slaves.
“If I do not kill you,” said the quadroon,
“will you promise to let me get away?”
“Yes!”
“You swear to give me time to get away?”
“I swear.”
He hardly believed it when the negro
sprang from above him, and, darting away,
stood outlined against the moonlight.
“I ought to have killed . you,” he said,
savagely. “I knew you were a detective all
along. And you came straight to this place
—right into my hands! A fine detective!”
The explanation of the attack came to Cur-
tis as such a surprise that he could say
nothing. He merely stared, and moved his
position for better defence against the assault
he felt might come again.
“I don’t trust your word,” said the quad-
roon, “but here—take these. If you let me
get away you can keep them ; if I’m caught
you’ll have to give them up.”
He threw something towards Curtis and
then darted into the moonlight and vanished.
A couple of minutes later Curtis also was
in the moonlight, pouring into his palm
from the small pouch he had picked up a
shower of bead-like things which gleamed
brightly. Pearls!
Then he broke swiftly for the hotel, pray-
ing in his heart for the escape of the man
who had come so near to killing him. In
his hand was the wealth that meant Bris-
bane, his old life and Lud^.
