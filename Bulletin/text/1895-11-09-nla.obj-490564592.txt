Some Recent Publications.
Hoole’s “Science and Art of Training”
(Is. 3d.) is an admirable little handbook for
athletes and would-be athletes.
“ All Men Are Liars,” by Joseph Hocking
(3s., 4s.), is a collection of dull ideas and
descriptions likely to be popular in any semi-
educated “ religious ” household.
Lessing’s “ Laocoon ” and a selection from
his other prose writings appear in the excel-
lent Scott Library (Is. 9d.).
The new volume in the “Contemporary
Science Series” is “The Growth of the
Brain, a study of the nervous system in rela-
tion to education,” by H. H. Donaldson,
professor of neurology at Chicago University.
The book has considerable novelty, interest,
and value ; but n®t for the average reader.
An interesting book is H. B. George’s
“ Battles of English History ” (3s, 4s), done
after the style of Creasy, but without
Creasy’s stupid moralisings.
“ Everybody’s Book of Recitations”
is an acceptable addition to a popular series.
Campbell’s “ Higher English ” (Is 9d) is a
valuable little text-book on the model of
Meiklejohn’s, and contains many useful gram-
matical and philological facts dexterously put.
G. W. Smalley contributes to October
Scribner’s (Is 2d, 14s per annum) an inter-
esting gossip about Huxley. Stevenson’s
home life at Vailima is described by Lloyd
Osborne. Some good pictures of San Fran-
cisco’s Chinatown illustrate the continued
“ History of the Last Quarter-Century” in
the U.S.
Gordon and Gotch issue in the “Austra-
lian Cricket Record,” by J. Fitzpatrick, o:
Junee, N.S. W. (Is. 2d.), a publication which
is much needed, and should be much appre-
ciated. It gives a record of important
matches played during last season in the four
eastern provinces (including those with the
English team), with averages of front-rank
batsmen and principal clubs, and many
other items of information which hitherto
have been unobtainable in such compact
form.
Alex. Lindsay reports that Louis Becke’s
new book, “His Native Wife,” is selling
splendidly, and the large edition printed is
already nearly exhausted.
“ Foreseeing that some who do not love
me will be swift to allege that in the prepara-
tion of these memoirs I have set down only
such things as redound to my credit, and
have suppressed the many experiences
not so propitious which fall to the lot
of the most sagacious while in power,
I take this opportunity of refuting that
calumny. ’ Is it not pleasant, when wearied
with the uncouth hurry of nowadays “litera-
ture,” to meet such restful grace of style
in the first sentence of Weyman’s new book,
“ From the Memoirs of a Minister of
France” (Cassell and Co., 3s., 4s.)? One
willingly accompanies so courteous an author,
even when the interest of his ciceronish
comment wanes. “ The Memoirs of a
Minister consists of short stories written for
serial publication, and though the book con-
taining them is well worth reading it has not
the force of a continuous story. It is un-
pleasant to have one’s interest lifted and
dropped every few pages, and to have to
adapt one’s mind every ten minutes to a
fresh set of persons and circumstances, which
yet pretends to be a familiar set. The matter,
too, though frequently good and strong, tends
on the whole to thinness, and the “Memoirs”
cannot be held equal to the author’s best
work.

THE STORY OF A BABY.
Ward, Lock, and Bowden issue Ethel
Turner’s new book, “ The Story of a Baby,”
as the first number of their new Nautilus
Library (2s. 9d.) —in size, type, binding, and
finish a paradise of dainty book-makers’
devices.
Add “The Story of a Baby” to “ Seve
Little Australians,” and one feels pret
Bure in saying that Miss Turner’s chie
hteiary characteristic will Drove to be, no
power, but charm. “ The Story of a Baby
is an extremely charming book, with am
amount of intuition and sympathy, and
good deal of careful observation, but fallin
short in the matter of insight and reality.
This must not be misconstrued: “ Th
Story of a Baby” does not fall short of i
aim—only of the impossible ideal kept fo
purposes of very special criticism. Bu
when Larrie and Dot fall out—they are twc
very young married people, and they fall ou
so frequently—Larrie is always unconvincin
-—to a male. His wife is an aggravatin
butterfly-girl, meant to spread prett
wings in the sunshine, not to make wa
and hive honey, and Larrie gets angr
with her. Larrie is 22, and very foolish
but is he not a little too foolish, too muc
like a dream of the unfettered girlish imagine
tion, when he quotes texts at his wife, parser
fashion, and harangues her schoolmaste:
fashion, and orders her to obey him anc
doesn’t know that he is doing his best t
incite her to disobedience ? It would seen
bo, to a mere male.
Compare the kindred idyll of Davi
Copperfield and Dora. David is sometime
a little vexed with his child-wife—as whe
Trad dies comes to tea and the oysters ar
put on the table unopened—but he doesn
bully her into rebellion. Certainly David i
older, and graver, and sensibler than Larrie
but his conduct seems more probable', ever
allowing for the difference of tempera
ment. And Larrie has brains—at least
he is a solicitor, if that counts ; and h
takes in The Bulletin (a beastly pape
which the servant surreptitiously purloin
and swallows in the intervals of butcher
flirtation) —and he loves his wife ; and hi
wife is about as much to blame a
he is ; so that he cannot altogethe
be classed with Balzac’s monkey who
played the violin. And if he is an
atypical male, is it fair to average males
to let him roam round the Red Road country
as a sample Australian, without drawback o*
proviso ? One answer to this query migh
be that Dickens acted the part of Larrie
rather than of David when he took a Dora
of his own, and that Larrie is really
common object in marital hedge-rows.
(Rhyme with “cows” to get the full flavour).
Another answer, and one eminently more
satisfactory to male prejudice, is that Miss
Ethel Turner is—Miss Ethel Turner, and
will know better some day.
That is the only fault, if it be fault, that
one finds with “ The Story of a Baby.” The
man may have occurred, but he certainly
isn’t normal, or he doesn’t seem normal to a
normal male. He is just an alleged-mascu-
line reduplication of Dot—Dot with a pipe
and trousers. Considering his youth and
temperament and the temptation he had to
make an ass of himself—why, he might have
done it. But then the author should have
persuaded us that he would have done it—
she should have choked the demon of impro-
bability before he had time to utter one cry.
And she hasn’t.
Miss Turner owes a good half of her suc-
cess to her talent for language, her sense of
words, her capacity to picture moods and
tensions with the living glow which they
have in her mind’s eye. No other Austra-
lian storyteller has ever prattled so plea-
santly.
Reference to “Seven Little Australians ”
shows it to still seem so good that one is
doubtful whether “ The Story of a Baby ” is
an advance. If it is, the improvement lies
in better restraint and proportion, better
elisions and omissions.
There is a paragraph (on page 28) which
is too close an imitation of one of Swin-
burne’s beautiful baby-poems. It should be
omitted in next edition.

COUGHS, GOLDS ON THE QUEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Heaxne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, theundersigned, have had occasion toobtain
HE ARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. G. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill_ with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; lie did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known ; in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours vary truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.—Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure.—J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir, —I had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwiek.”

With an ordinary tape measure determine the width
round the joints AA, round the instep 88, round heel CC,
round the ankle DD ; next ascertain the length and width
of tread by placing the foot on a sheet of paper, and
running a lead pencil round the heel and toes. Cut the
outline thus made with a scissors, and enclose with the
other measurements, stating what size you crenenfily take,
what are your peculiarities —a weak ankle, perhaps a pet
corn, ingrowing nails, or a blooming bunion. All these
little matters attended to. If you have a long thin foot, or
a short thick one, with very high instep, send to ELLIS S,
where you are sure to get a fit. The proprietor, with a

GEO. PAMMENT, Seddon-st., Kumara, N.Z. May 7,1895.
“ The boots you made me from description of my foot
and self-measurements have more than satisfied me. I
never had a pair of such well-fitting and comfortable
boots—so much so, that I have discarded all my old
enemies. Your price, including everything, does
not come up to the price charged here for boots not to
be compared with yours.”—JOHN M'ARTHUR, Police
Magistrate, Longreach, Queensland. May 31, 1895.
“ I am sending you an order for two more pairs of your
boots. Those you sent me were a splendid fit, and for
workmanship and durability they could not be surpassed.
I have had them in wear now 12 months, and there is not
a crack in them, and I have no more trouble with my in-
growing nails or corns.”—SAML. RUTTER, Moorara

A DISEASE, not a CEIME.
The constant abuse of alcohol fosters a crave—
a crave insatiable and deadly. It deprives valu-
able men of all reason and respect; it drives them
to acts of indecency and crime, and to drink what
their palates may even repel. At this stage
pledges and punishment prove useless, and
physical, as well as mental attention, is urgently
required.
The Orient Institute
has established a wonderful reputation in the
curing of this awful disease, and, during the past
18 months, many prominent men of our colony
have been restored to health, sobriety and
position. Alcoholic stimulants become not only
unnecessary, but, in the majority of cases, un-
palatable. Patients undergo no inconvenience or
restraint, and are free to eat and drink what they
like.
UNQUESTIONABLE TESTIMONY.
“ I had heard of the excellent results attending your
work, and was thereby induced to send my friend to you.
The results have exceeded my most sanguine expectations.
For the previous five years he has always been under the
influence of alcohol and gradually losing power to resist
it. Since he has been under your treatment a marvellous
change has been wrought in him. Not only does he
appear to be thoroughly cured of drinking, bub his
appearance, which had been degenerating, has improved,
and his color is healthy and bright. In short, the man
seems not only to have been purged of disease, but also
renewed mentally and physically.”
R. M. Mo. ANDERSON, 38 Pitt-St.
“ I sent a gentleman to Mr. Thomas for treatment in
April, 1894—about the worst case I ever knew—and the
effects have been most wonderful.”
ARCHDEACON LANGLEY.
“In the case of a gentleman whom I recommended
to the Orient for treatment of dipsomania (May, 1894),
the cure was both rapid and lasting.”

Spared to render it so ; and if convenient settees
and mirrors in abundance can contribute to that
end, then we are on the road to success. Under-
foot is oarpet of neutral tint and accommodating
hue ; above the ceiling is painted cerulean blue,
lending enchantment to the scene. All round are
crystal mirrors, in which lovely bonnets and still
more lovely faces reflect their beauty, giving the
tout ensemble of the surroundings a magic splen-
dour that only nature combined with art can
afford. There is an ever-changing
Panorama of Fashion in Our
Millinery Lounge.
BONNETS, lovely as the blushing morn, re-
splendent as the noonday sun, are everywhere.
The BONNETS come and go. Tuesday’s BON-
NETS are not Monday’s BONNETS, neither do

take part in Thursday’s display. There is perpe-
tual change ; a phantasmagoria-like review of
charming color and beautiful blends ; a kaleido-

From Torturing Skin Diseases
When a single application of the Cuticura Remedies will, lit

diseases, and point to a permanent and economical (because so
speedy) cure, when the best physicians and all other remedies fail ?

greatest skin cures, blood purifiers,
and humor remedies; are absolutely
pure, and may be used by the
youngest and most delicate with
gratifying and unfailing success.
CUTICURA
the great skin cure, instantly
allays the most intense itching,
burning and inflammation, permits
rest and sleep, speedily heals the CUTICURA TYPES OF HEALTH AND BEAUTY,
skin, and restores the hair. Cuticura Soap, an exquisite skin beau-
tifier, is indispensable in cleansing diseased surfaces. Cuticura
Resolvent, the new Blood and Skin Purifier and greatest of Humor

ments, and thus removes the cause. Hence the Cuticura Remedies

4®-“ All about the Blood, Skin, Scalp, and Hair,” 64 pages, 300 Diseases, 50 Illustra-

"Grin and. Bear It."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When we’re feeling rather seedy, and life seems a
gloomy page,
And our trousers are embroidered with the fancy*
work ot age;
When the shades of bygone pleasures throng
around in dim array
And point with ghostly fingers to the thorns upon
the way,
We are bound to meet a party who will give a
pious smirk.
And will say ; “ It’s very shocking; but, old man,
why don't you work ? ”
Then he’ll give his coin a jingle, will observe you’re
growing thin,
And repeat “ It’s very shocking —you must bear it
with a grin ! ”
Oh, the world is chill with shadows, dim with
dark reproach and crime,
And I fain would seek a subject that would shine
in brighter rhyme,
But the heart will not be merry when the stomach’s
fed with air,
And one’s only boon companion is the phantom
form of care.
It has all been sung so often—oh ! the dreary
time of need ;
“ Out of everything ” but hatred of the weary life
we lead.
And we still must live and lead it; but, although
it may be sin,
Though I’ll bear misfortune firmly, I’ll be damned
if I can grin I
Though the present holds no promise, and the
past no pleasure brings,
For “ a sorrow’s crown of sorrow is remembering
happier things,”
Yet I like to have the phantoms of the old life at
my beck,
When I used to meet my troubles —as they meet
me—with a “check ! ” *
When I fancied I had tasted all the bitters of the
cup,
If my tailor failed to fit me, or I lost a “ fifty-up.”
I could then atiord to moralise, in aphorisms thin,
And could take my gruel kindly—just like whisky
—with a grin.
I can grin no more—my brothers, we’ve enough of
manhood left
Not to weakly smile at evils that have left us hope-
bereft 1
There are hosts will do the laughing ; it is fortune s
pet who knows
That the funniest sight in nature is a man in
shabby clothes.
And there’s little use in “ growling,” we can bear
our ills with grace,
But —we need not lick the fingers that have
slapped us in the face.
When the bolts of fortune strike us we will let
him laugh who wins ;
He’s a Man who bears them bravely—he’s a Fool
who feebly grins !
Think it not! tho’ wrong oppress us, and we seek
in vain for light;
It is not by helpless grinning that we’ll triumph
in the fight.
If I laughed at every sorrow I’d be smirking all the
while,
And my cheeks would now be wrinkling in a most
expansive smile.
We may show our front to trouble, and may make
a bow to fate,
But ’tis only saints—and women—who can beam
on those they hate.
And I give this pledge to fortune, be it right or be
it sin,
When she smites me, well, I’ll hear if—but I’m
damned if I can grin !

Wragge : “Thus it is that factors which have
operated as secondary laws to cause a prolongation
of the dry weather have at length to give way

‘lnfinite and Eternal Energy’ from which all
things proceed.” In plain English—it has been

In-the case of the young man Clarke, charged with
using had language on Saturday night, although he
pleaded guilty and two constables swore to having warned
him before taking him into custody, two of the magis-
trates discharged him, the third dissenting. This sort of
thing will scarcely encourage the police in the execution
of their duty.
One of the merciful magistrates, it may be re-
marked, keeps a pub.
A young Melbourneite, about to enter the
civil service, was asked for the usual certificate of
birth. Now, he was born on the sea, on an
Australian-bound ship, and, therefore, reckoned
he was born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.
Knowing the ship’s name, he applied to the agents
for help. They advised him to search the news-
papers of tlie time. He did, and found this :
“Arrived s.s. Thingamy, from London, via ports.
Left with 58 passengers ; arrived with 59, one
lady passenger having on the voyage given birth
to a fine girl.” He swore.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKE RS.
WE bee to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American iobaoco Co.,
Ltd of N S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of Allen and
Gintcr’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the,manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THREE CASTLES” and Lt C-A-IPST-A-TsT. 75
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
7 fills’ “ Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

“ Yankee Boodle , 99 blended with Polities .
T)ie a bove is, of course, a caricature of the famous American national picture, which will be
li\fii later on. , ,
“YANKEE DOODLE” is everywhere spoken of as the finest plug-tobacco that has ever
appeared here, and it has won greater success during the short time it has been on the market than
anything previously. This is no idle boast, and, to prove it, any smoker can test the statement, foi
there are few towns in N.S.W. where “YANKEE DOODLE” is not known and sold. Its sale
has this year increased nearly one hundred (100) per cent over that of last year. And why is this .
Simply that “YANKEE DOODLE ” has struck the popular taste. In the first place, it comes after
?ear« of careful study, from a combination of certain choice Virginian tobaccos, so blended and
exquisitely flavoured, that any smoker who can stand a tobacco heavier than the pure gold-leaf is
forced to admit that he has at last discovered something far and away better than anything he has
been accustomed to. DIXSON & SONS have taken over half-a-century; to accomplish this ; and as
their leading business has been built up on their reputation for QUALIIY they could not afford tc
make the forgoing statement if any doubt existed. DIN SON & SONS who use more American leaf
than all the other Tobacco Factories combined, are noted for several brands CON-
QUEROR,” “SIR ROGER,” “CHAMPION,” and “DOLLAR;’ but “YANKEE DOODLE
ranks supreme.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 9, 1895.
“Taken from the County Gaol."
The case of Rofe, the Sydney solicitor of
influential family who went wrong, and
was sentenced to five years’ gaol, but was
instantly released on finding £2OOO security
for his good behaviour during the term
stated, has helped still further to convince
the public that there is a special law for the
lawyer and quite a different kind of law for
everybody else. The public was already
assured of this by many previous episodes,
but Rofe’s case is so especially glaring and
is such a conspicuous instance of interference
with the course of justice, that it has driven
the fact more firmly than usual into the pub-
lic mind. Rofe’s troubles began with the
notorious Butler trial of a few months ago,
Butler was—and, presumably, unless he has
been ameliorated by the gentle influences of
stone-breaking, still is—a man of shady
character who wanted to secure a divorce
from his wife. Therefore he hired certain
persons of equally bad character to swear
falsely to acts of immorality on her part, and
conspired with them to blast his wife’s good
name and get rid of her. Rofe was solicitor
to the conspiracy, and conducted the case,
and the court, with a lamentable lack of
perspicacity, implicitly believed the state-
ments of this sinister aggregation, and not
only granted the divorce but committed the
chief witness for the defence—one Johnson,
a brother of Mrs. Butler —for perjury.
Johnson was subsequently convicted and
sent to gaol for three years, and then, just
as the case seemed definitely ended, some
entirely new complications arose.
• • «
By a curious series of accidents the bottom
fell out of a memorable conspiracy. The case
against Butler's much injured wife was
proved to be pure invention in all its de-
tails, and the criminal law decided that
Butler, his private detective, his soli-
citor and other peisons had conspired
together to invent false and perjured
evidence, and to pervert justice as it
is in Botany Bay, and to blast the character
of an innocent woman. Johnson, the wit-
less for the defence, had already been con-
victed, so the cage stands somewhat as
follows : Johnson (it would appear) com-
mitted perjury, not for sordid cash considera-
tions, nor for any personal profit, nor with a
malicious intention to injure anybody, but
with the alrnost-pardonable idea of defend-
ing his sister from a brutal injustice. He
did evil that good might come. Knowing
that unhappy victim of manufactured circum-
stances, his sister, to bo absolutely innocent,
as she ultimately proved to be, but finding
it impossible to prove her innocence by a
strict adhesion to the truth, he tried to meet
perjury on the wrong side with a much less
heinous perjury on the right side.- He
(assuming his guilt, which even now is by no
means clear) proceeded to manufacture
some circumstances in his sister’s favor,
and, as already mentioned, was sentenced
to three years in gaol as’ a conse-
quence. Butler, who was urged on by
his desire to get rid of a woman of whom he
was weary, and thus had some kind of intel-
ligible motive, however corrupt it might be,
got seven years. His accomplices, who sold
themselves for money, and who could plead,
as some kind of extenuating circumstance,
that they were people to whom money was
an important consideration, got three and
seven years respectively. And Rofe, the soli-
citor, whose case had no shadow of extenu-
ating circumstances whatever— who didn’t
want to get rid of a wife of whom he had
grown weary, who came of a wealthy family
and wasn’t pressed for money, and who didn’t
perjure himself for a good motive, like John-
son, but conspired, and by his long-continued
silence shored up the conspiracy, against an
innocent woman, apparently from mere greed
and cold-blooded infamy—was nominally
sentenced to five years in gaol. But as he
was released there and then under the pro-
visions of the First Offenders' Act, the sen-
tence was purely nominal, and he doesn’t
serve even one hour’s imprisonment on
account of his crime. All of which goes to
show once more the advantages of being a
criminal solicitor in New South Wales, as
compared with the disadvantages of being
any other kind of criminal.
* • *
The circumstances under which the release
was granted were as extraordinary as the
release itself. Barrister Heydon, for the
defence, applied that solicitor Rofe should
be set free for these six alleged reasons :
(1) He was a young man, and one of those
to whom the First Offenders Act. was
especially intended to apply ; (2) He* had
been “ led astray ” by a cleverer man than
himself ; (3) He came of a good family ; (4)
The Law Institute would probably take pro-
ceedings in the matter, and cause him to be
suspended or else struck off the rolls ; (5)
The jury was influenced by “other circum-
stances just now in the public mind ” ; and
(6) Attorney-General Want had “ mentioned
that he would be glad if the Judge could see
his way clear to deal with Rofe under the
First Offenders Act.” Which altogether
made six of the most remarkable reasons
ever publicly advanced for the release of a
well-connected solicitor convicted of a heart-
less conspiracy against the honor of an inno-
cent woman.
* # *
The object of the First Offenders Act is
clear and distinct. It was found that the
practice of committing to gaol mere boys and
girls who had been guilty of one trivial
offence was not calculated to lead to their
reformation, but rather rendered all pros-
pect of reformation hopeless. The gaol
stigma made them practically outcasts
for the rest of their lives, and the
association with older criminals made
them, as a rule, incomparably worse
than they had been before. Considering
these results Parliament decided that per-
manent moral and social ruin was too heavy
a penalty in such cases, and consequently
the First Offenders Act came into existence.
But hitherto it has never been applied to
men educated in the law and practising it
as a profession ; it has been applied
almost entirely in cases where one wrong
action was done under sudden tenqitation or
extreme pressure of circumstances—not
where a deliberate, sordid, unprovoked in-
famy had been of many months’continuance.
The purposes of the Act, as carefully defined
the other day by that expert lawyer, Justice
Windbyer, apply to Rofb’s case as
little as they do to that of Dean, who
was also young and inexperienced, and
who conspired to save himself rather than to
destroy some one else. Also, they apply
very much less to Rofe than they do to
Johnson, who at worst committed his crime
out of natural love and affection, to save his
innocent sister—whereas Rofe’s offence was
com mitted to destroy an innocent woman—and
who was directly incited to perjury by the con-
spiracy of which Rofe was a part. Yet the
same Attorney-General Want, who was used
as a means of indirect interference to save
Rofe, is a leading man in the Execu-
tive which lately decided that Johnson
must serve his sentence to the bitter end.
If this is not one law for the lawyer, then
what is it 1 Also, it is worth mentioning
that the merciful Mr. Want, who, on his
own admission, was glad to see lawyer Rofe
go practically unpunished, was the Attorney-
General at Mount Rennie time, when the
last penalty of the law was inflicted upon
four boys (some of them first offenders) of the
average age of 18 years only.

The law claims to be no respecter of
persons, yet barrister Heydon, according to
the S.M. Herald’s report, advanced, as one
reason for clemency, the fact that Rofe
belonged to a “respectable family.” Pre-
sumably the intention was to ask that the
law should not take quite its usual course in
the case of a man with influential relations.
If there was no such object in view, then
there was no more reason for mentioning
that Rofe was well connected than there
was for stating that he wore No. 6 boots, or
that he had a gold-stopped back tooth ; and
if there was such an object in view, then
the plea was a tolerably straight request
that justice should be specially lenient to the
rich and well-connected criminal. The state-
ment that Rofe had been led away by
Butler was mere assumption. The state-
ment that he had suffered great mental
anguish is a mere truism; every criminal
suffers mental anguish when he is found
out (Butler made no admission until
he had been practically bowled out),
but ordy the influential criminal has his
anguish deducted from the sentence. And
the assertion that there were “other cir-
cumstances just now in the public mind ”
was a still weaker platitude, and it cuts two
ways. The other three conspirators were
tried under the same circumstances. There
are always other circumstances in the
public mind, and no man has ever yet
had the advantage of being tried when the
public mind was wholly empty of circumstances
of some unpleasant kind or other. Even
the statement that' the Law Institute would
probably deal with the erring solicitor was
utterly and stupidly irrelevant. In the first
place, the court had nothing whatever to do
with what the Law Institute might or might
not do at some future date. And, even if the
Institute has procured the utter abolition of
Rofe in his legal capacity, he thereby suffers
no more than any other well-advertised
offender who doesn’t belong to the legal pro-
fession. When a certain Sydney politician,
whom it will be charity not to name, was
sentenced for complicity in the doings of the
Australian Banking Co., he wasn’t formally
struck off any roll, but he was as completely
obliterated as if he had been. Other men of
less capacity, and probably of far less honesty,
make a large income as bank-directors, and
sit in Parliament, and become Ministers of
the Crown, but that politician, in all his
capacities, has gone under utterly. The
same inexorable rule applies to thousands of
men—to every man, whether of high or low
financial standing, who is convicted of dis-
honesty, or even of calamitous reckless-
ness, in any shape. It even applies
without conviction. One Southern poli-
tician, foremost in his day in politics and
finance, was, though no criminal charge was
ever laid against him in connection with his
miserable bank and his other disastrous insti-
tutions, silently and tacitly struck off the
roll, as a man whose career was ended. He
was a rich banker, an influential politician,
and successively held the highest of offices,
yet, in all these capacities, he was quietly
obliterated. The sympathy which is invoked
for the criminal solicitor who is struck off
the roll, as if his case was one of especial
hardship, is mere drivel. He only, at worst,
shares the common fate.
* * *
Probably the most unfortunate feature,
however, in a case which is full of unfor-
tunate features, is the indirect, even if unin-
tentional, interference of Attorney-General
W ant with the course of justice. Mr. Want
is a leading member of the Ministry which
has the power to make Mr Backhouse a
permanent, instead of merely an acting
Supreme Court Judge. Judge Backhouse’s
reputation is that of a man of absolute recti-
tude, but he is presumably only human after
all, and when barrister Heydon informed
his (acting) Honor, though not in so many
words, that the strong-willed functionary,
who may be able, if he pleases, to exercise
such an important influence on Judge
Backhouse’s fortunes, approved of Rofe’s
release, he did it, presumably, with the idea
that Mr. Want’s opinion would exercise
some sort of influence on the Judge’s deci-
sion. If he didn’t do it with that idea, then
there is no visible reason why he should
have done it at all. And it is utterly inde-
fensible that any outside person’s opinion
should be used for such a purpose, or that
because the rich criminal can afford to hire
an influential barrister who has friendly access
to the Attorney-General, he should thereby
gain any advantage, either real or apparent,
over the poor one whose cheap attorney
never associated with that important per-
sonage. Moreover, though it is safe to
assume that Acting-Judge Backhouse was
not consciously influenced by this expression
of opinion (which the Attorney-General
avers was a private opinion and not intended
to reach the ears of the Judge), yet at all
events he did promptly release the offender
as suggested, and that, too, while telling him
that he had committed a “very grave
offence,” and, almost in so many words, that
he had been guilty of perjury as well as con-
spiracy. The Crown Law Office has piled up
charge upon charge against other criminals.
Does it consider that Rofe has perjured him-
self, and, if so, does it think he should
escape prosecution for that crime ? In this
connection, it is notable that Dean has been
prosecuted not only for conspiracy, bub for
perjury.
* # *
But Attorney-General Want’s action
in expressing the opinion which was used in
this remarkable fashion was even more
unfortunate than the use that was made of it.
The Attorney-General, by virtue of his
office, represented the prosecution, and his
conduct in thus furnishing weapons for the
defence was most unhappy. The state-
ment that his interview with the defendant’s
barrister was private and not offici i! is lame,
for a private conversation simply means that
Mr. Heydon and Mr. Want met together and
talked ; an official conversation means also
that Mr. Heydon and Mr. Want met
together and talked. The best possible
photograph of their meeting couldn't show
any difference between an official interview
and the other kind; and when the Attorney -
General, the representative of the prosecu-
tion, meets the representative of the defence
in a case then proceeding, and talks about
the case, it is hardly possible to be wholly
unofficial. Furthermore, it must be remem-
bered that Mr. Want doesn’t administer the
First Offenders Act, which duty, as he
points out, lies wholly in the province of the
Judge; therefore his admitted statement
that he had no objection to Rofe’s release
under that Act was of no possible use for
any purpose except the one for which Mr,
Heydon naturally used it. Therefore, even
though Mr. Want didn’t make the
ment for that purpose, the only one which
it could possibly be used for, the public Will
probably fail to appreciate the nice distinc-
tion, and the administration of justice will
be discredited accordingly.
* * *
If Rofe had been tried along with his
three fellow-conspirators (that hre was not
tried with them was a mere accident) he
would presumably have had to serve at
least part of his sentence ; even Botany Bay
justice could hardly, when four criminals
convicted of the same conspiracy stood in a
row in the dock, have had the gall to let the
well-connected offender go altogether, and
send the other three, who were not well-
connected, to gaol; besides, how could any
Judge, after measuring Roee’s crime as
deserving of five years, let him go free,
while sending to gaol for her full term
Rofe’s female co-conspiratpr, whose offence
has been rated at three years only 1 The
same process of arithmetic applies to
Johnson’s case. The law, by sentencing
Johnson to three years and Rofe to
five, has deliberately put it on record
that the latter is much the worse criminal
of the two, and the dull, illogical public
naturally wants to know if the reason
why the smaller offender isn’t released while
the greater one goes free is that the latter is
well-connected and a lawyer, while the
former is neither. But it desires to know
this gently and in a low tone. For
by the peculiar workings of the party sys-
tem the Attorney-General, who holds a semi-
judicial office, is a member of the Ministry,
and the country can’t ask this question too
loudly because, if it did, it would pull down
the Ministry, and wreck the land and in-
come-tax, and the civil service reform
scheme, and Foreign-trade, and the Bogan
bridge at Monkey, and the forest-thinning
farce, and many hundreds of other things
in one act, and make W. J. Lyne Premier of
N.S. Wales. And to avoid these things
Johnson will probably have to rot in gaol,
and his sister die of a broken heart in the
hospital, and Rofe, the well-connected con-
spirator, go free, without much question.
Party Government is a weird and awful
affair.
Some More About the Rofe Case.
Were the same sort of justice served out to
the rascally solicitor Rofe as has been given
poisoner Dean, the former would be proceeded
against on a charge of perjury. In sentencing
Rofe, Acting-Justice Backhouse said : “ In
the witness-box, whenever you found yourself
in a difficulty, instead of owning that you were
wrong, you very often invented something
which was transparently untrue. I believe
your own evidence had more to do with your
conviction than anything else.” Is Rofe to be
prosecuted (like Dean) for perjury? If not,
why not? Will Attorney-General Want ex-
plain ?

Mr. M'Gowen, M.L.A., the supposed leader
of New South Wales Labor party, has done
himself no particular good politically by ex-
pressing his approval of the liberation of the
convicted attorney Rofe under the First
Offenders’ Act. It is a coincidence that Rofe re-
sides in Mr. M‘Gowen’s constituency, and is one
of the shining lights of a local church, while
M'Gowen runs a Sunday-school close by. Is
the Rofe release Labor-party justice ? What
say the Labor electors ?

Rofe was most diplomatically defended. In
the first place, he had the invaluable services of
Mr. Barton, Q.C., than whom no man is more
effective and popular with juries, and his turn
other counsel were Roman Catholics—it appa-
rently being a well-recognised rule of legal
strategy not to obtrude your own “ color ” upon
the twelve good men and true.
• # *
It cannot be said that the Crown unduly
pressed the case against Rofe. All through
prosecutor Wade’s address it could be seen that
he was prepared to give the accused the benefit
of any fair doubt, and his cross-examination of
the prisoner was not at all severe. Judge
Windeyer was not called in re the interview
between himself and accused in May last, when
Rofe admitted that the co-respondent in the
divorce-case was Butler’s paid servant. Why
was his Honor’s ev.deuce not taken?
• • #
Touching that interview between Roee and
Judge Windeyer, which prisoner’s counsel
traded on so largely, it is interesting to note
that it did not take place till May—on the day
following Davis’s arrest at Mrs. Butler’s
instigation. Also Rofe, according to his own
admission, had known Davis, the ruffianly

private-detective, and Williams, the co-respon-
dent, to be identical 4£ months before 1 He
was “disgusted” when he found it out ; but
he kept his “ disgust” to himself from January
tp May, and then—as Judge Sime j son expressed
when the fat was in the fire,” he told the
divorce Judge. From which it will be seen
that Roee, now a free man by reason of the
circumstance that his connections are rich
enough to find the prescribed .£2OOO security-
while his fellow-criminals are rotting in gaol —
really and truly behaved as a conspirator, and
not as the meek and weak young lamb his
advocates would have the world believe.
* * *
This is the way to get a clear view of the
unspeakable outrage on true justice committed
in releasing Roee. It was by pure accident
that Rofb was not tried with the other three
conspirators : that he was not so tried is due to
the fact that his guilt only became apparent
during the course of their trial. Suppose that
all four conspirators had been put into the
same dock, and tried and convicted and sen-
tenced together, how could Judge Backhouse
then have ventured to say in effect—“ Butler,
you scoundrel, go to gaol for seven years. Davis,
you ruffian, seven years for you, too. Roee,
poor young attorney, your share is five
years, but you won’t have to serve it.
I will not keep you in torture : you
may leave the dock on your respectable family,
or someone else, finding £2OOO security for
your good behaviour. As for you, Elizabeth
Peake, though you are a woman and this is
your first conviction, you will have to go to
gaol for three years.” At such a grotesque
spectacle the whole earth would have howled
with derision.
* • *
And why should this identical thing now take
place by reason of the mere fact that Roee,
convicted of the same crime, was tried
separately from his fellow-conspirators?
* * *
If ex-attorney Roee is really sorry for the
unspeakable wrong he has helped to inflict on
Mrs. Butler, and not merely sorry at being
found out, he, or the friends who were so in-
terested in him as to at once find the £2OOO
security necessary to obtain his liberation,
might consider the expediency of taking
measures to substantially compensate the un-
fortunate victim of conspiracy (now in the
Alfred Hospital, Sydney), who, with her two
children, is absolutely destitute. If, years
hence, Roee applied to the Supreme Court for
mercy, evidence of a little practical contrition
on his part at the time of Ins conviction would
much help him both with the Judges and the
public.

It is pointed out that last month a youth
between 17 and 18 years was tried before Judge
Gibson at Narrabri, and convicted of stealing
from the post two £lO-notes. The envelope
had been left open, and the boy, seeing the
notes, yielded to temptation. In extenuation
and as a reason why accused should get the
benefit of the First Offenders Act, his solicitor
pointed out that he was the main support of a
poor and widowed mother, and that the bulk
of the money stolen had been devoted to paying
off the arrears of rent of his mother’s cottage.
It was his first offence ; his general good char-
acter was deposed to by his chief, the local
postmaster ; by the local P.M., the local In-
spector of I’olice, and others. But Judge Gib-
son declared that the youth was not a fit sub-
ject for tue First Offenders’ Act; his offence
was far too serious.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A British Syndicate.
According to cable advices, some British specu-
lators propose to form a chartered co. to take
over the Northern Territory and run it on the
same lines as those of the co. which bosses
Matabeleland and other regions in South Africa.
The Northern Territory is at present adminis-
tered by South Australia, but its status is not
very well defined. It was “temporarily ceded”
to that luckless province a good many years ago,
but no definite arrangement was ever arrived
at whereby the temporary cession could be
made permanent. South Australia has supplied
the territory at great cost with roads and rail-
ways (such as they are), telegraphs, mail service,
police protection, artesian wells, public schools,
&c., and been a father to it generally to the
best of its ability, and has paid up nearly a
million of the territory’s revenue deficiencies.
Also, the territory sends two members to S.A.
Parliament, and is, to all intents and purposes,
a part of that province. Nevertheless, South
Australia has no absolute legal title to it, and,
under these conditions, the British syndicate,
with the alleged concurrence of Colonial-Secre-
tary Chamberlain, contemplates getting pos-
session of it in one huge grab, and working
it on the nigger and Chinese principles
commonly applied to such cases. On
these principles it could doubtless be
made a highly-profitable speculation—for the
company. A large Asiatic population could be
run into the Territory, and with cheap semi-
slave-labor an enormous amount could be done
in the way of mining, sugar, cotton, rice, and
tobacco culture, &c. The exact benefit which
this country would derive from these opera-
tions, however, doesn’t appear. South Aus-
tralia could also settle the Northern Territory,
if it pleased, with an immense Chinese, Jap.
and nigger population on its own account. It
has only to abolish all restrictions on
the yellow immigrant, and the Chow and
the other varieties of cheap leprosy will
come in like an rtnchained flood, and pro-
ceed to grow almost everything which the
province is capable of producing, and dig for
every mineral which its soil contains. In
short, if it wants to make the Territory a
nigger province, and lay the foundations of a
future racial war, and have lepers and idolaters
and loathsome epidemics slopping over into the
adjacent provinces, it can achieve its desire at
any time, and get for itself whatever profit
there may be to make up for these inconveni-
ences. The only reason why it hasn’t developed
the Northern Territory on these lines is that
no profit, however large, would be worth buy-
ing at the price. The British shindy kit idea
is a fine example of British ignorance, or
bombast, or something of the kind. What
Britain’s claim to the Territory may be is diffi-
cult to define. It never occupied, or explored,
or in any' way developed the country or did
anything whatever for it; all that has been
done is at the cost of Australia. ihe
cession to S.A. was only a temporary ex-
pedient, but, though no definite arrangement
was made for its permanent cession to the Ade-
laide Government, it is equally true there was
no definite arrangement for its occupation by
Britain at any future time. And whatever the
paper-rights of the British Government may be,
any attempt to set up in Australia a syndicate-
governed province, peopled by niggers and
Chinamen, and ruled on British commercial
principles, will mean trouble. The pity is that,
for want of a strong Federal Government, there
is no authority which can make as much trouble
as the occasion calls for.
The Divine Right of Sweaters.
Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Fitz Gibbon
decided some time since, by a small majority,
on the minimum wage. President Fitz Gibbon
fought the motion tooth-and-nail and has since
nullified it by its method of administration. It
is against rules now to sweat wages on Melb.
sewerage works, but the amount of the penalty
is fixed at the amount of the unlawful deduc-
tion made by the contractor, the penalty being
payable to the Board and not to the workman
sweated. The workman now knows that com-
plaint will be followed by dismissal, and
that the contractor will pay the fine
with a smile and recoup himself a hundred-
fold by continuing his oppression of the
poor. Fitz Gibbon readily fashions an appro-
priate sophistry. “The man who engages to
accept less than the minimum wage, and subse-
quently complains of his treatment, is dis-
honest. I will be no party to paying
that man the balance which he would receive
under the minimum wage, as such an act would
be giving a premium to dishonesty.” Dis-
honesty in the sweated is hideous, but dis-
honesty in the sweater is to be met by a
paltry fine, a mere license-fee to sweat. The
criminal who complains against? sweating gets
dismissal for his pains. The criminal who
sweats is allowed to continue as a contractor,
and his abominable practices are made a source
of revenue to the Board. Mr. Fitz Gibbon is
recommended to one of his own prescriptions
for crime. As one of the principal snuffle-
busters of the National Scripture Education
League, he once made these remarks : —■
The State’s first duty is the prevention of crime. No
man could forge unless he first learnt to write ; no secret
poisoning could be effected except by a highly-educated
man [such as Dean—Ed.]. What was to counteract this
effect? Nothing but the teaching of The Book, which the
State excluded.
The Bulletin recommends Fitz Gibbon and A.
E. Moore and one or two other choice spirits on
the Board to wrestle in prayer with the
sweaters and the sweated on the sewerage
contracts, and they can take their Bibles wdth
them as an effective cure for crime, with the
marker in at the following passages :
Behold the hire of the laborers . . . which is of
you kept back by fraud, crieth.
I will be a swift witness against those that oppress the
hireling in his wages, saith the Lord of hosts.
If I did despise the cause of my muinservant or of my
maidservant when they contended with me ; what then
shall Ido when God riseth up? And when He visiteth
what shall I answer Him ?
Fitz Gibbon howled piteously when his salary
was reduced to .£3B a week, saying something
higher was stipulated, and the Board unanim-
ously agreed with him. But when a wretched
laborer, sweated down to 12s. fid. or 15s. a
week—a wage to which his poverty and not his
will consented—complains, he is branded by
the bloated Fitz. as dishonest, and the Board
stands complaisant by. Fitz Gibbon and his
Board are become intolerable. They are a
perpetual insult to a democratic sense of
decency. They seem to represent nobody but
Fat Man, and they certainly oppress everybody
but Fat Man. They justify the wicked for
reward, they oppress the hireling in his wages,
they grind the faces of the poor. They are all
that the pious Fitz. and his sophistry and their
own pride and prestige can make them, and
they will reap the blessed damnation awaiting
those who drag iniquity with the cart-rope of
vanity.
The Gentle Kanaka.
Editor Bulletin, —Ere the sensation aroused
by the murder of a white man near Bundaberg
(Q.) by a gang of docile Kanakas subsided,
the mouldering corpse of a blackfellow was
found lying in a field of sugar-cane. The body
had been hacked by the tomahawks and knives
of the “cheap and reliable” laborers who
support Queensland’s staple industry. This
murder was the forerunner and cause of the
cold-blooded killing of the white man Lawty
on Oct. 19. The victim of the crime was one
Tobgo, a Malaytan, and about six weeks prior
to his body being found he was returning from
town to his plantation with two other islanders.
He lagged behind them, and was not
afterwards seen until his body was found,
top-dressing a planter’s cane-field. His fellow
Malaytans concluded that he had been killed by
Gala islanders, many of whom are employed on
a neighboring plantation. Rows between the
two tribes followed, and culminated in the
murder of Lawty, who was mistaken by the
assassins on a dark night for a Gala “boy.”
These facts are established by the confession of
one of the murderers. The supporters of the
slave-trade (a motion for the abolition of which
has now been tabled by Drake, M.P.) seek to
wriggle out of the dilemma in which these
murders have placed them, and by proposals
which are as brutal as they are absurd.
The Bundaberg council at last meeting
carried a resolution calling on Government
to restrict the Kanakas from visiting
town after sundown. This means that the gilt
is to be taken off the Polynesian gingerbread,
and that the docile Kanaka—thealleged Messiah
of the Q. sugar industry—is to be treated as a
slave pure and simple* It further means that
the planter who owns him and who runs a store
on the plantation will get back all the nigger’s
wages for inferior goods retailed at fancy prices
But it means still more than this. It will place
the country residents, whose dwellings are few
and far between, at the mercy of the planters
pets, and compel them also to remain at home
at night —and barricade their dwellings, xhe
consequences of keeping thousands of stalwart
adult male savages, supplied only with a few
score of their female countrywomen, out
of the town where alone their animal
propensities are gratified can be imagined.
Out of evil good will come in these cases. The
people are ominously growling and calling for
the abolition of the kanaka-evil altogether, and
events seem to be playing into the public hands.
To such a pass have things come in this Bunda-
berg district that, during the last six months,
no fewer than 30 or 40 white men have been
sent to gaol for supplying kanakas with drink.
The niggers give them the money and a com-
mission to buy the drink, and the starvmg
wretches, who have no chance of getting work,
risk three months’ gaol for the sake of earning
sixpence commission from a nigger wherewith
to buy a feed. Apropos , a few months ago
a gaily-attired demi-mondaine was charged
in the police court with disorderly conduct as a
■“ common prostitute.” She admitted the dis-
orderly conduct, but indignantly repudiated
the character given her. “I am not a
‘ common ’ prostitute,” she said. “I have
dealings with the kanakas only. A Mean
White.
The N.S.W. Council on the Land-Tax.
The N.S.W. Legislative Council, at latest
advices, was still hacking the Land and Income-
tax Bill out of all semblance of its original
shape. Up to time of writing the Land-tax
exemption has been wholly struck out; the
clause prohibiting the landlord passing the tax
on to his tenant has been obliterated; the
absentee-tax is abolished; the income - tax
exemption is reduced to .£l6O instead of £3OO
as proposed by the Assembly ; the provision
for State resumption of land at 10 per cent,
over the owner’s valuation has gone the way of
the Land-tax exemption ; and, instead of the
mortgagee coming under the Land-tax provi-
sions 7 the interest he receives is to be reckoned
as ordinary income and to pay income-tax.
This latter is almost the only alteration that
the Leg. Council has yet been guilty of which
is, in any sense, an improvement. It saves
much intricate and cumbrous arithmetic, and
as the tax will be calculated not on the amount
lent, but on the interest charged, it follows
that, instead of all lenders being taxed alike,
the usurer who charges 15 per cent, will be
required to pay just three times as much as
the man who charges only five, which is
a system that cannot be too highly commended.
This is the good aspect of the case, but it pro-
bably isn’t the aspect which the Council had in
view. The other side of the story is that,
assuming the land-tax to be Id. in the <£, and
the income-tax 6d. in the £, which are the
generally-accepted figures, the mortgagee, under
the new system, will pay, if his interest is 8
per cent., less than half as much as he would
under the system embodied in the Bill as it
passed the Assembly, while at 5 per cent, he
will pay less than one-third. This opens up a
way for sundry profitable swindles, one of
which would work something like this. The
registered owner of a mortgaged estate will
necessarily pay land-tax only on the proportion
of the property which he actually owns over
and above the mortgage. The mortgagee,
instead of paying land-tax, will pay income-tax
on the amount which he receives annually as
interest. There-fore, if the land-tax is levied, as
is generally anticipated, at Id. in the £ on the
capital value, and the income-tax at 6d. in the
£ of income, Fat Man may profit very consider-
ably. If he owns an unimproved property
valued at £120,000, the land-tax thereon will
be ,£5OO per annum. But if he transfers this
to his son or to his brother Bill, subject to a
mortgage of £lOO,OOO at 5 per cent., which
burden will effectually prevent Bill making
away with the property, the impost will be :
land-tax nominally payable by brother Bill at
Id. in the £ on £20,000, £B3 6s. Bd. ; income-
tax at 6d. in the £ on £5OOO a year interest on
the alleged mortgage, £125 ; total, £2OB 6s. Bd.
This means a saving of very nearly £3OO
a year, or three - fifths of the entire lia-
bility. If the interest is set down at 3 per
cent, the whole amount of the tax will be £l5B
6s. Bd. instead of £500; and if the mortgagee
reports that the interest is irrecoverable, the tax
will be almost nil. The small landowner will
gain very little advantage by this device, partly
because he is, as a rule, almost wholly un-
acquainted with the law, and partly because,
on a small transaction of the sort, the legal ex-
penses of the transfer and the mortgage would
make a serious inroad on the profit. But the
large Fat Man, if he is anything like the Fat Man
he used to be, will profit by it extensively, and
the result will be that he will be enabled to
dodge the largest part of his share of the tax
while the small holder pays up in full. Another
result will be that mortgagees w'on’t foreclose
openly on the land when the principal and in-
terest are overdue; instead of becoming
nominally the owners that they really are,
they will transfer the property to the same use-
ful brother Bill, and remain ostensibly
only mortgagees as before. Still another
result will be that, even apart from
all fraud, a large proportion —probably one-
third—of the anticipated proceeds of the new
impost will disappear altogether. The abolition
of the absentee-tax is apparently mere cussed-
ness, as the legislators of the Council are not
absentees—at all events, not at present. The
abolition of the land-tax exemption and the
reduction of the income-tax exemption are
apparently done to increase the number of tax-
payers, and consequently the number of people
who will have an interest in abolishing the tax,
and to wreak a poetic vengeance on many
people, including the members of Assembly,
who voted for the tax under the impression that
it would only apply to the other man. But the
amendment of the mortgagee-tax is a harmless-
looking provision, which seems as if it didn’t mean
anything at all, and yet may mean a very great
deal. Yet, with all this, there is one amendment
made by the Council which should have unreserved
approval. T t has wholly exempted mutual-life
assurance societies from the operation of the
Income-tax, so that they will pay Land-tax
only. It is a pity they were not exempted from
Land-tax also. Considering how many exemp-
tions the churches have got, this is only fair ;
the life-assurance and the soul-assurance insti-
tution should stand on the same level. In fact,
if there is any difference, the former should have
the preference. The life-assurance institution
generally pays up its engagements in full at
death ; whether the soul-assurance concern pays
its engagements at death no one has ever yet
ascertained.
The periodical deputation of Presbyterian par-
sons (with the New Hebrides Co., most of whose
shareholders live in Sydney, at their backs)
waited the other day on Premier Reid and asked
him to use his best efforts to keep the French out
of the New Hebrides, and the Premier, instead
of throwing the deputation down the stairs, as
he should have done, weakly promised to
hustle round in the matter. The New Hebrides
are fully 1100 miles away from New South
Wales, and about 1000 miles away from the
nearest part of Australia. They lie on the
other side of New Caledonia, so while France
has New Caledonia, the annexation of a few
small islands beyond it can’t make the
danger of French aggression any worse than
it already is. They are further away than
the Dutch and German territories in New
Guinea, and they are of no earthly importance to
New South Wales and of very little to Aus-
tralia in general. But the New Hebrides are a
convenient preserve for the Presbyterian mis-
sionaries, about twenty of whom make an easy
living by telling the local brown savage about
the advantages of hell. If the French annex
the miserable little group, then the R.C.
fathers will come and tell the brown man about
hell instead, and herein lies the beginning and
middle and end of the whole trouble. It is a
poor, mean, sordid scramble after the loaves
and fishes and cocoa-nuts, and Australia, which
has no interest in the matter, p Ljos»ld let the
respective parties struggle for them the best
way they can.
The Social Gimlet Brigade will have a good
time in Tasmania if a certain bill for the pro-
tection of children becomes law. This measure
provides that any policeman, or any other
“authorised person,” may enter the house of
any “reputed drunkard or prostitute,” and
haul any children found therein before a magis-
trate, with a view to having them sent to an
industrial school. All the parsons, and all the
aggressive teetotallers, and all the old pious
gorgons of both sexes intend to be authorised
persons under this bill, if they can manage it.
Then, as no one can define what “ reputed ”
really means, they will be at liberty to raid the
house of every person whom they suspect to
smell of drink, on the ground that he is a
reputed drunkard, and every poor woman
whose means of livelihood—as explained by her
to the intruding old person of the W.C.T.U.—
do not appear sufficiently definite. The Tas.
Parliament should insert a proviso in the bill,
w'hile there is yet time, that no parson or
teetotal-lecturer, or member of the W.C.T.U.,
or the Y.M.C.A., or the Y.W.0.A., or the
Social Purity Society, and no bounding brother
or sister of any sect whatever, shall be an
“authorised person.” If it doesn’t, there will
be a great multiplication of the interfering old
women who love to tramp six abreast into
another person’s home, and tell her that, unless
she can give a satisfactory account of herself, it
will be their painful duty to “take steps.”
According to S.M. Herald’s report of Judge
Backhouse’s remarks when sentencing attorney
Roee, His Honor said :
The sentence of Che court is that you, Thomas Ernest
Rofe, be imprisoned and kept to hard labor in Her
Majesty's Gao) at Darlinghurst for five years; that sen-
tence to be suspended under the provisions of the First
Offenders’ Act for two reasons. First of all, for what has
been said about the Attorney-General, because I am glad
that the Attorney-General’s view is the same as mine ;
but the responsibility rests entirely with me,” &c.
The plain, ordinary meaning of this is that
the Attorney-General’s expression of opinion,
brought to the ears of the Judge, was
one of two reasons which influenced him
to suspend the sentence. Does Judge Back-
house admit the correctness of this report ?
Does he deny it ? If it is correct, does he think
his administration of justice should be influ-
enced by the remarks of the Attorney-General
(who is, after all, only one of two parties
to the suit Reg. v. Rofe) whether
made intentionally or, as alleged in this
case, in the course of a private conversation
not meant to be divulged to the court ?
Are Judges in future to ascertain which way
the Attorney-General’s wind blows, before
making up their minds? Suppose Attorney-
General Want had thought Rofe ought to go
to gaol, would Judge Backhouse have con-
sidered one of his “reasons” gone, and sent
Rofe to gaol ? There have been Judges on the
Australian Bench who, informed during the
progress of a case that the Attorney-General
had expressed this or that hope about the sen-
tence, would have d d the Attorney-General
so effectually that the retailer of his conversa-
tions would have shivered for the rest of his
natural life at the mere recollection.

Alfred Dampier re-appeared at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) on Saturday as the picturesque
Starlight, in “Robbery Under Anns,” and a
crowded house gave him such a reception as
hardly anyone ever got there before. No one
fully realised the full value of this fine actor and
kind-hearted gentleman until he took his depar-
ture, a year or two ago. When he re-appeared on
Saturday, and his magnificent voice filled the
furthest recesses of the big theatre, the public
rose and stated truthfully, with its feet and
hands and stick and the end of its umbrella, that
Dampier occupies a place on the Australian stage
which no other man at present in this country can
fill. The character of B ddrewood’s idealised
bushranger suits him admirably, and, from
beginning to end, his performance is all that
could be asked for. To be bush ranged in Dam-
pier’s gentlemanly style would be a pleasure and
a privilege ; there is a culture and finish about it
which suggests being bailed-up in Greek verse,
or burgled in absolutely select Sanscrit, or vio-
lently assaulted in Latin. Dampier looks no older
than he did when last seen in Sydney ; that is to
say, he looks about 30 or so, and, if he were con-
victed before a near-sighted Judge, he would
probably be let off under the First Offenders’
Act, on account of his extreme youth.
After Dampier, the best feature of the
drama is the aboriginal of Alfred Woods—
a small and inhumanly active nigger, who does a
lot of miscellaneous service, and bounds like an
india-rubber fiend through five long acts. His
dialogue is scanty, but his bounding is powerful
and highly finished. Miss Lily Dampier’s fine
horsemanship helps out the part of the bush-
ranger’s best girl materially. Mr. Plimmer looks
a lofty and beautiful inspector of police, and
Messrs. Rolfe, Leston, Lachlan M'Gowan and
Haybittle, and Misses Elliott and Katherine
Russell, and a large number of horses, all contri-
bute to keep the show going in various ways of
more or less importance. But the interest centres
mainly round Dampier, and Woods’s aboriginal,
and the scenery, which is particularly good, and
the four horses which are rescued from the burn-
ing stable. A subtle odour of genuine Australian
horse pervades the entire drama in fact, and there
is a faint perfume of gum-tree and wattle right
through, which is eminently pleasing, and a heavy
shower of real rain is thrown in as a guarantee of
good faith,
* * * *
“Old Kentucky ” has settled down to be
an eminently moderate success at Sydney Lyceum.
For some reason or other American drama is
seldom more than a moderate success in the land
of the wattle, and this particular drama is so pro-
foundly moderate in every respect that its impor-
tation is unaccountable. A remarkably strong
company has, so far, prevented its dropping with
a sickening thud into the place where it ought to
be, but each night it seems more and more of a
pity that so much ability and money, and good
painting, and valuable horse, should be wasted
upon it. Elton and Miss Helen Dauvray are
worthy of better things, and the spectacle of Scot
Inglis wandering round pointing a futile gun at
the hero, yet never shooting that sketchy person,
can only be explained on the assumption that the
gun isn’t loaded. Also, King Hedley has little to
do except be a pallid countenance in the midst of a
jungle of black whiskerand stand around generally.
A villain who does hardly anything in view of the
audience, save be recognised as the person who
killed somebody 20 years before, is not active
enough for this great country. A general want of
energy, and a scarcity of plot, and a lack of inci-
dent, and a gentlemanly slowness in the last three
acts are the chief objections to “ Old Kentucky.”

Lawler’s Sydney Music Hall opened on
Saturday, before the paint was quite dry, with a
very respectable programme and" a packed audi-
ence. A number of good vocalists and a fine
orchestra are points in the show, and Horace
Bent, whose murky countenance shines on theo.p.
side, has lost none of his moist and fruity humor,
and has accumulated a lot of new jokes during his
prolonged absence from the stage. Horace appears
to improve with age. The ballet of 12 girls all at
once is a pretty and lavish item ; and the four
acrobats (the Leopold Brothers) are remarkably
proficient in their own rather monotonous line of
business. Someone with an intelligent eye to legs
has selected the ladies of the company, and among
the 14 or 20 of them who dance, there isn’t one
that doesn’t dance well. Also, most of them are
sufficiently good-looking to pass inspection any-
where. If the new enterprise keeps on as it has
begun it ought to fill a long-felt want, or some-
thing to that effect.
* * * *
Herr Hajek, the Austrian man of muscle,
has been added to the Tivoli programme this
week. Hajek is an incredible person who places
himself across two chairs, in a neck-and-heels
fashion, and balances an anvil on his chest, and
hires men to pound furiously on it with sledge-
hammers. This is not the kind of amusement
which any ordinary citizen would care for, but
Hajek apparently enjoys it. When ho is out of a
billet he generally accepts a temporary engage-
ment as a steam crane, and he does a little in the
way of shoving off stranded ships. He is also
good at forest-thinning, as he lifts the trees out by
the roots. Some airy proceedings with cannon-balls
and similar small trash which he perpetrates at the
livoli are not meant to be taken seriously ; when
Hajek is in a serious mood he never lifts anything
below a ton. Like most men of stupendous
muscle, he is a soft-hearted person and easily
moved by a tale of woe. and in these moments of
emotion he generally goes out and carries an iron
safe several times round a paddock to calm him-
self. Altogether Hajek is an interesting person.
* * * *
The memorable spectacle with the brown
legs in it is still doing well at Sydney Royal,
where it will probably hold its own for some time.
There is nothing new to report about this stupen-
dous dazzle at present. The Fitzgeralds’ show
leaves at the end of the present week, Mahomet
and the Professor and his tank, and the
Roumanian lady, and the Altons, and the rest of
the clever co., having urgent engagements else-
where. It is reported on bad authority that the
Roumanian charmer has received and rejected
sundry offers of marriage from influential johnnies
during her stay in Sydney. The valor of the man
who wants to many a lady (already married)
capable of falling on him from a height of 140 ft.
must be of the most desperate description.
* * * *
Mahomet, the talking horse, of Fitz-
geralds’ show, after visiting the Australia bar,
without bridle, help, or guidance, and merely at
trainer Probasco’s request, lately walked up
30 steep steps into the studio of Kerry and
Co., the Sydney photographers. Arriving
there he remarked that fifteen ladies were pre-
sent, and that he’d like to embrace all
fifteen. One lady violently responding with a
frenzied wish to hug Mahomet, she and the four-
footed soul kissed each other upon the cheeks.
.The photo, ceremony over, Mahomet proceeded
home to lunch. Putting tiis head down near the
steps he sagaciously followed his nose with one
foot after the other, and arrived safely in the
street.

The excuse for re-opening Melbourne
Alexandra is a five-act horror, which might be
mistaken for the horror now being played at the
Royal, if it were not such a rough caricature of
that previous production. Or, perhaps, the other
horror is a rationalised version of the Haleck
drama; or, possibly, the two awful things were
the work of twin brothers who exchanged ideas as
they went along, in which ease one twin must have
been less drunk than his relative, “ The Broad
Arrow” is supported by a villain with long,
black, oily hair, and a hero whose hair is equally
black, but cropped short and not at all greasy.
Charles Holloway, as a rather humorous convict,
also contributes largely to the support of
his own show. Other members of the cast,
including Oily Deering, Miss Dora Mostyn,
Miss Gresham and George Majeroni are over-
shadowed by a railway-smash. The villain per-
sistently heaps false charges upon the hero, and
Holloway always aids the monotonous young
man to escape, but the remainder of the plot is a
¥m re *' an "^ fc) °f small talk and minor offences.
When a corpse is required to thicken the plot an
unknown convict casually slaughters a warder,
and the body of this harmless intruder is used in
evidence against the wrong person. “ The Broad
Arrow ” is full of surprises that thrill the gallery,
its railway-accident is a blood-stained triumph by
John Hennings, and the easy prices of admission
indicate that Charles Holloway means to fill the
house. Ihe state of the interior on Saturday was
fairly encouraging.
* * * *
Meantime, the Royal flourishes by means
of ‘Man to Man.” The railway-smash in this
instance has unlimited stage-room at its disposal,
and the comic felon seems a more acceptable
monster than his counterpart at the Alexandra.
His frank and open style of wrecking a passenger-
tram in order to pick up a few togs makes him
popular with all classes, and when he is observed
threading his way through the ruins of the awful
railway-calamity, with a portmanteau in each
hand and a happy smile upon his face, the audi-
ence is delighted to think that his efforts were
duly rewarded. George Rignold and his reliable
00. deserve something better than the work of the
less unsober twin, but art is of no great conse-
quence whilst business remains good. “Youth”
will come up for judgment when called upon, next
Saturday or later.
* * * *
At the Princess’s a kaleidoscopic change of
operas is keeping the company well employed,
fo-night (ihursday) “ 7 fascotte ” occupies the
bill ; to-morrow, “Vicar of Bray,” and on Satur-
day they revive “The Gondoliers.” New tenor,
Courtice Pounds, is an event of the very near
future.
* * * *
Meib. Opera House is lavishly attended at
this festive season, and the twin wheezes of the
ventriloquist fall on good ground. An enduring
feature here is the club-swinging by 15 amazons.
Other items come and go, but the lime-lighted
damsels swing on with a poetry of motion which
never palls.

The Oriental Carnival at Meib. Exhibition
turns out almost better than was expected. The
street in Jerusalem, painted bv artist Harry Grist
is a solid scenic effe t, and the ladies in Eastern np-
parel who haunt that main thoroughfare are dreams
of beauty for the most part. Also, their business
energy in such matters as the raffling of one
golden sovereign among thirty members at a
shilling each deserves great praise, seeing that the
same coin of the realm is always expected to
realise a “6ver” at a church bazaar. Entertain-
ments on a platform under the dome are lively
and frequent, the concert-hall holds out a good
musical programme, and the quadrangle, with
festoons of coloured lamps gleaming upon a bicycle
race or half-mile sprint, is an exceedingly
pretty side-show. Furthermore, a Harem
Theatre for amateur opera performers has been
fixed up near the concert-hall, and dissipations too
numerous to mention are crowded into the tout
ensemble. As a Carnival on its bare merits, apart
from the cause of Jewish charity, which is under-
stood to be interested in the profits, this Carnival
deserves to do well.
Nearly 100,000 human beings are born
every day on to this weary old planet. Every
10 days a fresli million of excited men rush
forth at 2 a.m. seeking for a million nurses in a
million remote suburbs. Every day is, therefore,
the birthday of a hundred thousand somebodies.
Which means that the question, “ What shall we
give as a birthday present ? ” is daily agitating an
incredible number of households dotted over the
globe. In Sydney, the other day, a cold, hard-
headed business man had a birthday, whereupon
his three little children gravely invited him to the
circus ! And he went, and was a better man for
it. But this form of present is not always practic-
able, so when the birthday of one of your friends
comes round, you cannot do better than call at
Mark Fuy’s. A handsome silk blouse, a pair of
French shoes, an elegant sunshade, a set of Winsor
and Newton’s artist’s materials, a pair of choice
vases, a handsome fan—any of these would please
just as well as a circus ticket; and, as to prices,
no house can please you like Mark Foy’s.*
In our advertising columns will be found
full detailed particulars of a great property dis-
tribution scheme, concerning the disposal of a
valuable lot of Sydney city and suburban property
by the Equitable Building Society, Brisbane. For
this purpose the society is issuing 150,000 shares
of the value of £1 each, which carry no liability
whatever to the holder of same. The properties
have been obtained from the Colonial Finance
Corporation, Sydney, by conditional purchase,
and were carefully selected by that corporation.
They comprise a total value of .£150,000. Nearly
all of them are situated in and around Sydney.
The first prize in the distribution consists of exten-
sive business premises in George-st., Sydney, oppo-
site the Commercial Bank of Australia, at present
occupied by Messrs. J. C. Lovell & Co., and two
large wool stores in Kent-st., occupied by Messrs.
Mofflin and Co. Ltd, These properties are valued
at £28,500, and return a net rental of £866 per
annum, which will no doubt be considerably in-
creased as present leases mature. No. 2 prize is a
large property, extending through from Princes-
street to Kent-street, with the extraordinary
depth of 330 ft., on which is erected four houses
and two cottages ; and included in this prize is a
block of land in Clarence-street, adjoining Sydney
Town Hall, the total being valued at £21,000.
There are in all 508 prizes, including, apart from
those already mentioned, a large brickworks at
St. Peters, capable of turning out 100,000 bricks
per week ; a splendid mansion at Heathcote,
with garden and orchard, and 48 acres of land;
a large block of city property in Jamieson-street,
Sydney, together with handsome 10 roomed house
in Ocean-street, Woollahra; several excellent
shop properties in Oxford-street, including Wig-
zell’s Turkish Baths; and other valuable build-
ings in city and suburbs, together with a few in
country districts close to Sydney. One most
important point in this distribution is the fact
that so many of the prizes are rent producing.
The values placed upon the several properties
seem reasonable, and would probably be realisable
even in the present existing state of the market,
but it is considered advisable to offer them
through the medium of a property distribution
so as to secure their more rapid disposal. The
committee of management of the society includes
the well-known names of the Hon. B. B. Moreton,
Hon. John Donaldson, and Acheson Overend,
Esq., while the Sydney Board of Reference
comprises Messrs. Bruce Smith, J. F. Burns, and
W. J, Green, all of whose names are sufficient to
give to the public an undoubted guarantee as to
the distribution being carried out with perfect
bona Jides in an honorable manner. Mr. George
Adams (Tattersall) has placed his complete ballot
apparatus and his services at the disposal of the
committee, and will personally supervise the
drawing, which is in itself a guarantee that no
hitch will occur in this respect. The drawing is
announced to take place on December 20th, 1895,
so that intending shareholders will require to
make early application, as the list will close on
the 17th December, 1895. According to ihe arrange-
ments as advertised each shareholder will have no
less than 30 separate chances, so that an investor of
£1 may receive the amazing dividend of £125,910.
Altogether, the Equitable Building Society’s
distribution seems a thoroughly legitimate specu-
lation, and offers every investor fora very small
sum a fair chance to become a property holder on
a large scale. Shares and all particulars can be
obtained from the secretary of the Equitable
Building Society, 212 Queen-street, Brisbane, or
from the Society’s Sydney agent, Mr. G. C.
Chalmers, 72 Pitt-street, Sydney. The fullest
partieu'ars as to properties wdl be found in the
advertising co’umns of this paper.

Dear Bulletin,—You say “The feature of the Melb.
Artists’ Carnival was the four-hoise drag traversing
Collins-st. with a dozen Pierrots aboard. So it was-the
saddi st feature. Professional ciicus clowns are not
sparkling jokes, but compared with their amateur
imitators tt.ey appear very venial offences. You should
have seen the di zen Pierrots off the drag— running loose
in the Exhibition building with the amiable intention of
being funny ! It was a harrowing spectacle. —One Who

Dear Bulletin,— Re “Lola Montes.” According to
Mr. Ryan’s reminiscences the whilom favorite of the
Bavarian monarch arrived in Australia in ’57. The pre-
sent writer saw her perform in ’54—when she danced the
spider dance at Geo. Ooppin’s Theatre Royal, Geelong.
Her figure must have been very willowy, as her stage-
jacket, which the scribe had in his hand, was volumin-
ously padded to give her the semblance of a decent figure.
There are other errors in Mr. Ryan's reminiscences.
The name of the editor whom she horsewhipped was
Sekam, not “Senior,” and the affair did not occur at
Ballarat, but at some other town. A reference to the
files of Geelong Advertiser and Melbourne Argus,
between ’54 and ’56, would settle the matter.- Call Boy.
The man in the pay-box was half asleep, nevertheless
there was a packed audience in a Melbourne theatre a
few y’ears ago. The play was one in which a snowstorm
occurs, and the part-author of the production, who was
surveying the show from the d.c., noticing that the snow
was falling in a very miserly fashion, whispered to a
dramatic critic who sut next to him—“ 1 know' what that
means. The blanky idiots have run out of paper for the
snowstorm.” “Well,” said the critic, *’why don’t they
use the paper you’ve packed the house with?" Garnet
chuckled.
Why don’t variety managers, instead of programming
songs both dull and dirty about unexpected babies and
drunks who go home with and men whose
pants, deteriorated by arguments with a dog, are mended
with tripe, revive some of the good old songs of the
’sixties, such as “The Old Folks at Home," “Old Black
Joe,” “Nellie Gray,” and “Going down to Dixie?"
Moore and Burgess have made a big score lately with
such revivals.
Maud Hobson, Bradfield, Kaye and Bantock got a cable
at Adelaide from Ehwardes asking them to go overland
from Naples, as they were wanted at once to rehearse for
the new Gaiety piece.

We are leaving Victoria’s shore,

Actors, “on their own,” are a dull lot.
Rignold, in the last act of “Joseph of Canaan," made
up facially as pastor Walters—a bald head would have
made the likeness complete.
Geo. Rignold and parson Walters have publicly shaken
hands. A truce now that Melb. season of “Joseph” is
over, and to last till the play needs a good advt. else-

say, Flora Graupner as Griolet.
Dear Bulletin, —The end of that bright amateur
comedian, Jack Stanway, the shipping clerk who was the
tool in those Melb. Custom - house frauds, was a
tragedy indeed. The convicted firm is not much
worse than most other people — hundreds of firms
cook invoices for the Customs—and nearly all firms
have a clerk at £2 or £3 a week or so pulling
the thestnuis out of the fire to the tune of thou-
sands a year. If the clerk refuses to pull the chestnuts
out of the fire, the monkey “ sacks ” him. But that
firm was found out, and its catspaw—who hadn’t
benefited by the frauds—came down the hardest, because
he was the person of least account. Stanway suffered
from a painful internal disease, which was aggravated by
the shook of going to gaol, and the anxiety for a wife and
children left destitute, and when he was committed to
prison he utterly collapsed. He could not w ork, and the
warders, thinking he was another Emanuel Abrahams—
as he was employed by a Hebrew firm they thought he
was a Hebrew—dragged him on to his feet when he had
fallen from sheer wpaKness. Suddenly the medical autho-
rities took alarm and ordered his release, and he went
home to die. Three days later Stanway was buried, his
crazed wife screaming “Goodbye, my Jack!” as the
hearse started for the cemetery. A man dying an
agonised death—a crazed woman—a wrecked home —
because a smart firm swindled the Customs of half
the duly on cheap watches per medium of a clerk,
who bad to help them swindle—or starve. Let the
amateurs of Melbourne help Mrs. Stanway.—Randolph
the Reckless.

The grand old Bank of New South Wales shows
A net profit for the half-year of £84,787, and the balance
of £21,848 from last half-year-makes the splendid total of
£100,685 available for distribution. A div. at the rate of
9 per cent, per annum and interest at 6 per cent, on calls
paid in advance absorb £84,536, and £22,049 is carried
forward. A sum of £14,225 received as premiums on new
Shares is added to reserve, making it. £1,172,297. Paid-up
capital is now £1,894,200. Tire B.N.S. W. has Hie unprece-
dented sum of £6,731,525 in cash, and over £1,000,000 in
other liquid securities, equal to nearly one-third of its
entire liabilities to the public. The fact that it keeps
this enormous dead weight of coin lying practically idle,
and yet pays a handsome div. and shows no falling away
in the profits, is an awkward commentary on the stereo-
typed explanation put forward by other institutions, that
their decline is not owing to unprofitable investments,
hut to the necessity for keeping large cash reserves which
earn no interest. The balance-sheet of the B.N.S.W. is
decidedly the most satisfactory document of its kind
which Australia has seen in this much-depressed year.
• * • •
The last Bank of England returns showed the
cash-balance of the British Government, held by that
institution, was £6,722,000 —for a Govt, with a yearly
revenue of £95,000,000 and a population one hundred
times as great as Queensland. Compare the two —
£6,722 000 for a population of 40 millions ; and £4,069,954
for a population of 450 000. Or, as the Courier puts it
“Queensland, with a turn-overof 3| millions per annum,
holds a hank balance of over four millions ; while Great
Britain, witli a turn-over of £95/00,000, holds a hank
balance of six and three-quarter millions.”

The Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney has
given one month’s notice of the release of all its extended
deposits. The sum reconstructed by this institution in
’93 was a little over £10,000,000, hut instalments have
been set free at various limes, and the amount of this
final release is only about £1,000,000. The Bank of North
Queensland was the first institution to completely se t
free its reconstructed cash, and the Commercial Banking
Co. is the second. The National Bank of Aust.rala.sia
should certainly he the third. The National, according
to its latest balance-sheet, has a considerably larger pro-
portion of cash to deposit liabilities than the Commercial
Banking Co., and under these circumstances it is difficult
to understand why it should not, follow that institution s
example—except it he that the great bank-scare was most
acute in Melbourne, and the hair of the different financial
institutions stood up so violently through the horror of
that episode that it has never really got down since.

The finances of Maoriland, as expounded by
Treasurer Ward, are arousing consid'rable ill-feeling.
Many years ago Maoriland used to float its loans with a
sinking-fund attached for redemption purposes. For a
while the payments to this fund were made regularly,
and at one lime about a million and-a-half was thus
accumulated. Then the Sfout-Vogel Government passed
an Act whereby the payments to the sinking-fund were
still made, hut the Treasurer was allowed to borrow each
year an amount equal to that which he put into the fund
and the interest received on past accumulations, and use
it as ordinary revenue, or for any other purpose he
saw fit. Most of M.L.’s recent surpluses were
produced by thus practically annexing the annual
payments to the fund, hut still • this process did
not cause any actual increase of the public debt, and so
long as the amounts annexed were us ,j d for public
works only the province was certainly doing very
much better than any of its neighbors. The process
panned out as follows : The Treasurer would pay, say,
£lOO,OOO out of revenue to the sinking-fund ; he would
borrow £120,000, being the amount of the payment and
the interest on the fund, and put it into revenue, then
there would he a surplus of £120,000, and it would be set
aside for railway extension or other like purposes.
This year, however, Treasurer Ward uses
the sinking-fund money, not for public works hut to meet
ordinary expenditure. And, though he only paid £43,000
Into the fund, and the interest on the £BOO,OOO or £900,000
which still remains to credit of that affair is not likely to
reach £40,000, lie borrows no less than £145,000. The
explanation given is that some amounts which might
have been borrowed in past years were not borrowed, hut
considering how carefully the fund was cleaned out each
year this seems highly improbable. The common theory
is this: The Govt, has lent money to local bodies, and
their sinking-funds, which are really trust money,
are in the Treasurer’s care. It is alleged that Mr.
Ward has commenced to borrow them, as well as the
State’s own sinking-fund, to square his shortage, and, if
so, Maoriland is surreptitiously using borrowed money for
ordinary revenue purposes. At all events, sundry ques-
tions asked in the House have been replied to with a great
scarcity of information, and Mr. Ward’s finance is begin-
ning to he viewed with some suspicion. Ward’s principal
critic, by the way, is Stout, whose own finance was the
most awful thing imaginable.

According to the complete returns for the year
ended June’9s, the N.S.W. Post and Telegraph Depart-
ment shows a deficit of £123,332 on working expenses
only (if interest on money borrowed for construction pur-
poses is included it is about £lOO 000 more); Queensland
has a deficit of £81,390; Weslralia a deficit of £16,823,
and Tasmania is short by £17,048. On the other hand,
Victoria makes a profit of £73,167 ; South Australia
makes £17,683, and Maoriland makes £67,675. The work-
ing exp nses of the posts and telegraphs are, on the
whole, nearly half as much as those of the State railways,
hut the receipts are less than one-quarter as much. None
of the Australasian postal departments, except, perhaps,
those of Vic. and Maoriland, would pay their way if charged
w ith interest on cost of construction, and the majority
don’t even come within gunshot range of paying working
expenses alone. The postal and telegraph shortage, in
several cases, is very much worse than (he railway short-
age, and in proportion to the amount of capital invested
it is as much as 30 times worse; and the chief cause of
the trouble is political log-rolling. Vet, somehow, the
country, which worries so much about railway deficits,
never seems even to notice the postal deficit. Why not
apply the independent-commissioner system to the post
amt telegraph departin' nt ? It is as much needed there
as if ever was on the railways.

The Scotsman (E linbnrgb) comes down with a
sickening crash on the National Bank of Maoriland for
publishing a highly-prosperous-looking balance-sheet and
then straightway asking Slat." assistance to keep it from
closing its doors. This leading British paper evidently
d lesn’t know the difference b tween the National and the
B.N.Z. A"d yet the flnancid opinions of papers like this
are solemnly cabled out to Australia as something of
importance.

The affairs of the Equitable Life Assurance
Society ■ f t ie G.S. have been carefully overhauled by the

of all ti e society’s securities, and a legal examination into
the titles of th" properties, and a careful audit of the

The peaceful, unobtrusive collapse of the N.S.
Wahs nuilding and investment institutions still goes on.
Last week’s record begins with the Australian Mutual
Investment and Building Co., which reconstructed in ’93,
and now proposes to re-reconstruct on the following
a l, - ' ei- sipairising basis: The last two years’ deposit
interest up to 28th July, ’95, is to be added to the prin-
a,,,.., ,id of being paid in cash. After that date
interest Is to cease altogether. When certain preferential
claims have been satisfied the depositors are to begin to
get their money back at the rate of 6d. in the £, when-
ever the co. is in a position to pay the 6d., hut the date
of repayment is wholly indefinite. Depositors who are in
a hurry may, however, take out 85 per cent, of their
claims in property, but whether the property is to be
taken at the co’s own valuation is not stated. As the
depositor, however, must either take the property or else
wait an indefinite number of years for Ills money without
interest, he probably will have to accept the co’s valua-
tion and he thankful. The A.M.I. and B. Co., according
to the latest available figures, owes in N.S.W. £247,000
to depositors and £llO,OOO on other liabilities, and its net
assets in the province are set down at £209,000, of
which £lO are in cash. This means that, the shortage is
£148,000. The last div. was declared in 1891.

St. Joseph’s Investment and Building Society,
Sydney, a large concern of 27 years good standing, the

writing off £47,301 10s. for further depreciation, and the
shares have therefore been reduced in value by £4 10s.
apiece. Some time ago £2 10s. per share was written off,
and the result is that the shares which, in 1892, were paid
up to £lO are now paid to £3 only, and nearly three-
fourths of the capital has entirely vanished. The society
has £lBO,OOO of deposits, and its whole assets are
£233,000. The net profit of the business for the year is
only £2500, and the beard reports that even the much-
reduced values placed on its properties are almost wholly
nominal, as sales are practically impossible. The selling-
value of an article which nobody wants to buy is always a
rather uncertain affair.

The Newcastle Permanent Investment and
Building Society reports that the profits of the year have
been more than absorbed by the insatiable item of depre-
ciation. Therefore there is now a debit balance at profit
and loss of £4406. Under these painful circumstances,
shareholders who have given notice of withdrawal are
requested, by way of a small, unofficial reconstruction, to
accept 4 per cent, interest instead of the 6 per cent, due
to them “in order to avoid an appeal to the Supreme
Court.” If they don’t accept, the society will presum-
ably appeal to the Court and reconstruct formally.

A petition for the winding-np of the National

The Bulletin would much like to know, as a
matter of certainty, w hether, when a life-policy falls due,
either through death or maturity of the endowment, and
the amount is p rid over, the recipient will be liable, under
the N.S.W. law, to pay income tax upon it as part of the
year’s income. In Victoria an attempt has to
collect, tax in this f ishion, and in this paper’s opinion the
action is wholly indefensible. When a life-policy falls
due, it simply means that the savings of many years are
taken out in a lump from the place where they were
deposited, and the amount isn’t income, hut principal.
Moreover, in most eases, the insurance-policy only comes
in when the family breadwinner is dead, and if the widow
is charged prohate expehses and legacy duty and mis-
cellaneous fees, and 2J per cent, income-tax on all her
little pile, and then invests it and has also to pay income-
tax on the interest it yields, it, seems a case of stepping
pretty heavily on the bereaved family.

The Perpetual Executors and Trustees .Associa-
tion (Melii.) reports that it has made a loss of £197 as the
result of a rather desolate year’s operations. Also it has
been considered necessary to set aside £5900 of the reserve
to meet further possible josses, so that that fund is now
reduced to £lO,OOO ; and the co. lias a robust overdraft of
£3451. The earnings of the trustee business for ttie year
were only about £2OOO, and the working expenses and
rent were £3756, so that the interest earned by the invest-
ment of the co.’s own capital had to fill the gap. In other
words, it lived for the year mostly by chewing its own
tail. The trouble is said to be largely owing to the fact
that the co’s office property has been vacant for 18
months, a firm which formerly rented it having
ceased to do so; and as a new tenant has now been
found, the concern won’t live quite so much on its own
tail in future.

persons, and saves the widow and -the fatherless from
the “ gent, one ” solicitor and the soulless and defaulting
trustee, reports a net profit of £lOO7, or with last balance
£1795. £lOOO of this will pay a 4 per cent, div., leaving
£795 to be carried on, so that the co’s position has im-
proved by £7. Although the div. is small, still the share-
holders should ha satisfied, considering the depressed
times and the phenomenally good health of various
moneyed people who really ought to he dead.

It is not only proposed in Melbourne to make
compulsory the registration of all assignments (with a
view to killing secret compositions), hut also to make the
records open to the public on payment of a fee.
The bill prepared provides that an assignment
must he assented to by a majority of creditors in number
and value, and further that no release shall be granted un-
less assented to by a four-fifths majority of creditors in
number and value. It further proposes to wipe out the
street corner assignee, and the assignee who ha : no “ re-
engnis d ” commercial standing. Recognised h.v whom ?
Whoever " whom ” may be, he or they take good care that
any estate worth having does not drift away from those

The Vic. Trade Protection Societies will not
relish the proposed fee. They now have to pay 2s. 6d. for
every writ copied (and they must copy all of them), Is.
each for hills of sale, and so on for other searches; the
proposed additional charge will scare them badly. In
ordinary times it. costs each co. fully £lOOO per an. for
search fees alone, and should the Registrar charge 2s. 6d.
each for assignments, the self-appointed guardians of
commerce will sicken of the job.

The hauls made lately by certain Melb. leather-
dealers, who foresaw a rise and bought heavily, are small
compared with the prospective profits of certain wheat-
operators. Wheat now booms owing to the dismal pros-
pects of the coining harvest. Estimated balance of the
last two seasons’ wheat held by Melh. grain dealers on
Oct. 25, last, was 426,824 bags. As most of this is held
under lien by the grain co’s and the big operators who
bought at an average of, say, Is. lOd. a bushel, there is
quite a Coolgardie in store for the lucky holders; at time
of writing wheat was firm at 3s. 10d., and will probably
reach 4s. by the time this is in print.

Latest move in the Manly ferry competition
a reduction of fares to Bd. for a 14-mile trip. But it can-
not last; something will have to burst. How the conser-
vative P.J.S.S. Co., compelled to initiate the new reduc-
tions (instantly followed by the Co-operative Co.), must
bemoan iis own hullheadness in times when clients
pleaded for an alteration of the old tariff 1
This competition looks likely t o end in the death
of one of the two cos. The origiinri P.J.S.S. Co. tariff was
ls. 6d., and, on its refusing to reduce to Is., the residents
organised a co-operative co. which did (he trip for 9d.
The old co. thereupon came down to 6d., and its rival
speedily did likewise. In last week’s papers it was
announced that the younger co. had contracted for the
building of a fine steamer, capable of doing the trip in
15min. less time than at present. A day or so after, the
old co. reduced its season-tickets 50 per cent. 1 The
transparency of the dodge was apparent. The Co-opera-
tive Co., which, so far, has been immensely successful,
readily accepted the challenge, and reduced its season-
tickets to the same level, and its daily fares from 6d.
to 3d. ! The battle will now be watched with much in-
terest. How the old co. can manage to carry on at this
ruinous tariff—considering its already deplorable financial
position—is something puzzling. Its shares, paid up to
£3, are saleable at Id.

Re the seizure of £lOOO worth of contraband
jewellery at Sydney, an obviously-inspired S.M. Herald
paragraph says that: “As far as can tie learned it has not
yet been decided whether there shall be any prosecutions.
lt. is thought by some of the officers that the ends of
justice would he met by the confiscation of the goods.”
This is the old spare-the-poor-attorney argument in its
commercial form. One of the calamities of Australia is
the widespread doctrine that to swindle the State is no
crime. If anybody has swindled the Customs he should
go to gaol as does any other criminal (except a lawyer).
Apropos, twelve hundred (1200) imported
blankets were seized in one day recently by Vic. Customs,
on the ground that they were pine cotton made up to re-

An evil winked at by Tasmanian legislators is
the "truck” system in vogue at most of the southern
saw-mills. Onoe a man gets into the clutches of mill
employment (writes a Bulletin correspondent) he is
“ fixed.” Long hours at the hardest of rough bush work,
with the attendant miseries of mud and slush in winter—
and all this for little more than food and clothing: that
is what it means in the long run t The “ hands ” are for-
bidden to deal away from the mill. The crews of the
small vessels trading for timber, which are generally
owned by the mill proprietor, have strict orders not to
bring any uoods for the employes : violation of this rule
means "sack." Married men are the ones who feel it
worst, being powerless to move. These are the men who
are preferred and wanted, as, having families, they are
good consumers, and as they generally manage to get
into debt, they could not leave if they wanted to.

I suppose, writes “ Scotty the Wrinkler,” you
some limes meet people who talk Bywong. I’ll tell you
what Bywong is. It is a field that in any country hut
N.S.W. would support 1000 miners. As it is, a clique of
cockies, hacked up by backstairs influence, holds the
land, not. to play, hut to wait. There’s not a title on the
ground, and the pre-titles are taken up on the strength
of a good fresh deal under a new Act.

At Bywong, N.S.W., Lowe and Atchin’s 40

Gympie remains dull; last month’s yield would
be poor but for the phenomenal crushing from Jones’s
Caledonian—23 tons for 15830 z brings the total
to 66950 z. from 6147 tons. Phoenix contributed 17740 z.
from 1748 tons. Divs. totalled £l2,92s—Jones’s Cale-
donian, £4950; Phoenix, £5000; 1 N. Phoenix, £1000;
Phoenix P.C. Tribute, £1975. Total calls for 10 months of
this year (£99,773) are ominously near the divs. (£106,291),
with the consequence that many men are out Of work,
and speculators’ faces are none too bright.

As here foreshadowed, the Brilliant Extended
(Charters Towers) has reconstructed for the second time.
Owing to the great depth of the shaft it was found impos-
sible to work with the ordinary steel rope, so they had to
timber. Borrowed £6500 at 7 per cent., bub that was a
mere drop in the bucket; now they are after £25,000,
which should be all right.

Tim Bowerbird (N.Q.) field, which was going to
surp ss ihe Palmer, has dwindled woefully, on close
1 lisped ion.
Theodore Durrant, organist of the Em-
manuel Baptist church, San Francisco, has been
convicted of outraging and murdering Blanche
Lament, a co-teacher with him in the Sunday-
school, whose dead body was found last Easter
Sunday wedged up in the belfry. Another girl
nam'd Minnie Williams, a member of the Sunday-
school Bible class, also fell a victim to Durrant,
and bet body was found in the library of the
church on Easter Saturday. The proceedings
in connection with the trial of Durrant,
against whom a - strong primd facie case ex-
isted, have extended over seven months—a
striking testimony to the tardiness of San
Francisco justice. Yet even this delay is prefer-
able to the system which, in some of the Austra-
lian provinces, prejudges in haste, and repents—
when it is compelled.

A Cap-day Episode,
A well-known juvenile plunger, attired in latest
London style, did Derby-day with bad results to
his pocket; winding up by planking his all on the
last race, and going home stone broke. However,
he easily raised some money from his friends, and
shone again in all his glory on Cup-day. At
first, however, the fates were again against him ;
the Cup was coming on, he felt certain he knew
the winner, but could not raise another pound on
the course. Waiting an opportune moment, he
made his way to the bookmaker with whom he
had been betting and said, “Look here, Alf., old
man, I’m broke and have the winner of the Cup,
lend me ss. on this cigar-case, it is filled with
B. L. Corto Rothschilds cigars, and they cost me
6d. each.” “B. L. Corto Rothschilds,” said the
book, “ give me one —quick. Will I lend you 55.,
will I bless you all my life? What’s your fancy?”
The youth told him. “ .£25 to nothing, that is
what I’ll lay you—keep your case, but if you win
you must band me a box of 25 of those cigars,
they are the best in the world.” Our friend’s
fancy won and he got his £25, and before the day
was over he had won £lOOO. The B. L. Corto
Rothschilds are acknowledged by all keen judges
to be the beat value in the world at fid. each.*

N.S.W. Council, when discussing the in-
come-tax exemption, tried to define a “ living
wage,” and one fatted nominee named Cox
rendered himself famous by announcing that “ a
man and his wife and five children could live on
I4s. a week ; he regarded 14s. a week as a living
wage for a man and his family.” The Bulletin
respectfully asks Mr. Cox if he will devote, say,
three months of next Parliamentary recess to an
attempt to live with a wife and five children (no
restrictions made as to whose wife she is), and buy
clothes for himself and for them, boots, hats, coal,
firewood, food, keep the furniture in repair, pay
for rent, school fees, lighting, medicine if need be,
and supply all other wants on 20s. a week, let
alone 145., and yet not degenerate into a gaunt,
shoeless, long-haired, matted, wolfish spectre and
a barbarian. And if he won’t make the attempt
then he should for ever hold his peace as a man
who hasn’t the courage of his own bad opinions.

Billy White laments the march of the
New Woman. “ Billy,” chief of the remnant of
a Westralian tribe, lately took to wife one Willa-
gin, a half-caste, and to celebrate, they made a
bee-line to the nearest Settlers’ Home. Police-
man X. happened to be there, and the landlord
was wary ; so Willagin caroused “on her own.”
Westralian law allows a “ dhrop” to a half-blood,
but denies the luxury to the bona-fide “nig.”
Willagin disported herself in the bar; Billy
gazed wistfully in, and when the policeman
appears, says Billy : “Look here, why you no let
me get rum ? You let my woman—all my money.”
X. is conciliatory and explains. But Billy doesn’t
see the logic of it, and with voice rising rapidly :
“All plurry well, she get grog, me stay outside—
and I'm de boss ! ” Just put all the sarcasm into
that that Billy did, if you want the real flavor.

A Melbourne woman is suing the executors

A week or two back Melb. Block was
startled by the spectacle of a knickerbockered
damsel swaggering along Swanston-street. Two
or three hundred astounded males gathered to
watch developments, but when the lady stepped
daintily on to the front seat of a South Yarra
tram and extended her shapely legs before her,
even the ranks of Tuscany could not forbear to
cheer, and the tram disappeared southward with
a mighty hooray in its wake. In certain papers
reference was made to the incident, the social
status of the lady being spoken of in most dis-
paraging terms. As a matter of fact, the fair one
is a leading sassiety cyclist who had met with an
accident to her “jigger,’’ and was compelled to
return home without it. Since the publicity, the
lady’s hubby has, it is said, shut down sternly on
bikes and knickerbockers.
# * *
The dramatic sequel to the nuptials of that
gilded Melb. youth and his blushing bride, erst-
while the shapely seat-warmer at a local music-
hall show, is that both the parties were, imme-
diately after the happy event, taken under the
wing of the officiating clergymaff; and after resid-
ing at his parsonage for a few weeks they decided
to cast off forever the tights and neckties sym-
bolical of the world, the flesh, and the devil, and to
embrace the mother church rather than the nearest
barmaid or chappie. The conversion was soon
completed, and to-day the happy couple, ecstatic
in their new-found faith, are skimming over the
China Sea en route for the Flowery land, where
they intend starting mission work. It makes one
smile!
* m *
It is coming ! The other day the Anglican
Bishop and the Cathedral precentor (the latter pro-
secutor in a case of disturbing a religious service)
were accommodated with seats on the bench at a
Sydney police-court. The presiding stipendiary
(Oapt. Fisher) is, by the way, the son of an arch-
deacon (of Calcutta). As all are supposedly equal
before the law, no party to a suit, or anyone con-
nected with him, should be on the judgment seat.
The administration of alleged justice in N.S.W.
has fallen into such inexpressible contempt in con-
nection with several recent celebrated cases that
even the smallest aggression on the impartiality
which should characterise the proceedings of the
courts is worth nothing.
* • »
At Sydney Central court one day last week
a prisoner complained of the number of aliases
placed opposite his real name on the charge-sheet.
The stipendiary overruled the objection, where-
upon the man behind the spikes objected to the
arresting detective remaining in court and exam-
ining the witnesses. He was again overruled, the
magistrate adding, “You seem well up in police-
court practice.” “I am sorry I cannot return
the compliment,” was the retort. Both the
accused man’s complaints were perfectly legiti-
mate. Placing a number of aliases on the charge-
sheet is only a silent and venomous method of in-
forming the bench that the accused is “known.”
Also, the arresting constable should be outside
with the other witnesses. The police are not
such angels that their testimony should be re-
garded as intrinsically better than that of ordinary
citizens.

The wood-work of
the prison buildings at
Port Arthur (now called
Carnarvon), Tas., is
slowly but surely being
demolished by time and
English ivy. The latter
will soon hide even the
bloodstained stones of
the. buildings. Massive
cell doors, unopened for
a quarter of a century,
have been forced from
their position by the
ever-strengthening ten-
drils of the plant. The
rusted iron bars travers-
ing the glassless win-
dows have been thrust
aside by the insinuating
arms of the ivy, and the
vigorous parent stem
outside in the sunlight
is continually pouring
in an army of yellow,
sickly - looking feelers
which steal like serpents
across the rotting floors,
through the damp and
gloomy cells, and up and
down the dark stair-
cases. Truly, all nature
is conspiring to obliter-
ate this horrible monu-
ment of man’s inhu-
manity to man. The
persistency of the ivy
deserves every encour-
agement.
Gippsland possesses the largest earth-worm
in the world — Megascolides Australis. Ordinary
specimens measure between four and five feet long
and one inch thick, but Prof. M‘Coy once
measured a living one, six feet long. It lives
principally in sloping creek banks, but is some-
times found under logs. When it hears a noise
on the surface above its burrow it retreats
rapidly from the sound, making a distinct
gurgling sound as it does so. Alive, it has a
curious smell, much like that of creosote ; dead,
the odour is worse than that of the strongest and
smellfullest creosote. The dead body by decay
passes into an oily fluid, which Gippslander
assert is very good for rheumatism. Fowls refus 8
to touch the worm, either living or dead. Hel e
d
in the hand the worm contracts its body, and,
from a row of dorsal pores extending almost the
whole length of the back, squirts out jets of milky
fluid to a height of several inches. Other very
big worms have been found in India, Ceylon and
South Africa, but up to date Megascolides is the
daddy of the lot.
It is quite evident that a lot of these worms
journeyed to Melbourne to welcome Gov. Brassey.
PRAYING FOR RAIN.
“At Hannan’s water is very scarce, quantities being brought in from
White Feather. Frequently the hotels can supply nothing but raw
whisky, not even beer, and no tea is provided at meals. People are
rushing into Coolgardie, where water is plentiful. The residents of
Hannan’s are execrating the Government and praying for a big thunder-
storm.”-WESTHALLAN TELEGRAM.
“ I WOULD be thankful for a little rain; still I CAN take it neat."
The Bulletin could smell them at Sydney, 600
miles away, in a south wind.

warding an invitation for them to attend his
church. The baron replied briefly to the effect
that he’d patronise his own parish church and no
other. However, as he happens to be a Christ
Church parishioner, the snub missed its mark,
and parson Tucker, report says, is “ swellin’
wisibly! ”*
Melb. reporters chronicled the details of
the Brassey reception ad nauseam; not even
drawing a veil over the sacred scene of pa kissing
his married daughter on the pier. They neglected
to mention, however, that prior to a certain
solemn ceremony the hero of the occasion forgot
to take off his hat until, just as the wriggles of his
advisers were becoming convulsive, he realised his
omission and repaired it with an undignified grab.

The fact that the two Melb. Bishops were
given standing-room on the dais when Gov.
Brassey was being sworn-in, whilst Parsons
Rentoul and Bevan, and others, were having their
rev. corns trodden on by “ the push,” has given
much offence in Presbyterian, Methodist, Wes-
leyan, and Mormon circles.

One fat society lady, after publicly describ-
ing a series of beautiful meandering curves, has
discovered that the admixture of cycling with
whisky is incompatible with safety.
A middle-aged Tas-
manian Adonis of gigan-
tic proportions was lately
induced by some lady
friends to go to a fancy-
dress ball as Rob Roy
Macgregor—or some such
fiend. The whole after-
noon before the festival
he sat in his garden
with his knees bared to
a furious sun until he
reckoned they were done
to a turn. Then he
donned the costume and
walked forth to the
gathering of the clans.
During the Highland
fling Macgregor’s brawny
knees began to crack and
presently flaked off. The
whirlwinds emanating
from the ladies’ dresses
playfully caught up the
fragments of Rob, and
soon the ball-room was
like a garden when the
dead leaves fall. Square
inches of Scotchman
floated gently on to the
dancers and even pene-
trated into the supper-
room, and the air at
length became so charged
with bits of Rob Roy
Macgregor that what was
left of him was induced
to quit with a fringe of
burnt pelt hanging over
earh stocking and his
knees glowing like a
couple of head • lights.
He went to bed and
stayed there for a week
with an oil poultice on
each knee.

Adelaide undertakers
assert that Anglican and
R.O. clergymen always
charge fees for burials,
and that parsons of other
denominations act gra-

“ deaders ” outside their
own flock, or when the
undertaker tries to make
a convenience of them.
Apropos of the sweating of hospital nurses

nurses now work on the eight-hours system.
Result, improvement both in health and in

W ellingfcon
(M.L.) is mainly a
wood - built city,
and if you live in a
terrace you can
hear, through the
thin timber parti-
tion, the remarks of
your next door
neighbor quite
clearly. Strangers,
especially the Eng-
lish variety, don’t
understand this
local peculiarity at
first. Recently some
English people took
a house in a Wel-
lington terrace and
lived there for one
calendar week.
Then they explained
to the landlord that
they must really
leave unless the
man next door left
olf pounding his
brawny cheat while
he was having his
bath in the morn-
ing. The landlord
replied that the
man next door was
the only reliable
pay in the terrace,
and that a tenant
such as he was
might slap his chest
or any other part
of himself as loudly
as he liked at any
period of the day
or night. So the
English family left
in disgust.

An address of welcome to a new Governor
from the inmates of a local Benevolent Asylum is
no laughing matter. It’s a BlK'ekmg mstance of
the humorless spirit in which loyalty is
worked.
• • •
The popular Tory belief that every work-
ing man is a mannerless pig, who “scoffs ’ his
victuals with weird noises and casts the bones to
his wife, is not likely to be dispelled by the be-
havior of certain Vic. Labor-members at public
functions.
# * •
Strictly untruthful accounts of the Brassey
"mention were published by Melbourne’s rival
-veiling journals. Each narrative, being built
'non the official programme, gave out that Brenner
Turner and Attorney-General Isaacs rode into
town in the same carriage with the new Governor
and his wife, whereas these two statesmen sat
visibly depressed (Isaacs was, anyway) in a pre-
ceding carriage. Wallington and another richly-
caparisoned person enjoyed the glory which was
to have been theirs. According to the Queen s
regulations, or Imperial etiquette, a Governor on
the supreme occasion of being sworn-m must be
“ attended ’’ by the two people who sit with their
backs to the horses. Ministers of the Grown
would rank as companions, not ‘attendants
and half of the public hysteria would be absorbed
by the minor planets, so to speak, though the
multitude might really be intending it all for his
Excellency.
Therefore, Turner and Isaacs, just as they
began to prepare for facing the new idols en route,
were tapped on the shoulder by Wallington and
told to regard their dream as over, and their hopes
as fled. The extra-speshal organs of evening
opinion committed another brazen tarradiddle in
stating that Brassey hung-fire upon bt. Kilda
pier whilst the “ fresh voices of 2000 children rang
out the National Anthem.” Nothing of the kind
happened. The attempt to give Brassey a musical
treat was made before he arrived at the pier.
The melody was to have come floating o er tne
waters, but merciful breezes blew the noise back
into the yawning chasms of those 2000 children,
and Brassey escaped their artless twang, it is
only fair to admit that the youngsters might have
made a much worse noise than they did. For 1 1
most part they merely opened tneir monotonous
countenances and grinned at their own loyal
absurdity.

Three days after arrival Lady Brassey
went shopping in Democratic Melbourne. A
gaping and increasing crowd followed m her
wake up and down two streets. Finally they
“treed ” her in a drapery establishment, and the
mob blocked the footpath. The proprietors slid
Her “ Lydyship” out through the back-door into
Little Bourke-street, and she sneaked home
through the rotten-cabbage ways of Ghowlancl.
# * *
There is already grave discord at Melb.
Govt, House. All through the Hopetoun i regime,
the man who had the management of the show
business, and was even most conspicuous on
“State” occasions, was private-sec. Wallington.
He was Hopetoun’s guide, philosopher and friend,
and no doubt thought he was going to be the
same under Brassey, judging from the proceedings
at the first lev6e. But that assertive young man,
the Earl of Shaftesbury, arose in his wrath, and
snorted rebellious blasts, and at the next levee he
played first fiddle, Wallington being relegated
to his propah position.
# # #
The Brasseys have been “kodaked” all
over Melbourne, Men and women armed he in
wait for Lady B. as she goes shopping, and directly
she steps in or out of her carriage (lifting her skirts
in the act) there is a loud click, and half-a-dozen
.ictures of her ankle are registered. Directly Gov.
Brassey stepped ashore at St. Kilda, ‘ click, click,
click,” went the instruments as he kissed his
daughter, Mrs. Freeman-Thomas.
• • •
On the first Sunday morning after their
arrival Lord and Lady Brassey and Mrs. Freeman
Thomas (Lord B.’s daughter by his urst marriage)
went on a cycling spin around Toorak and St.
Kilda. Lord B. uses a tricycle; the ladies,
bikes: —
The last day of the Vic. Artists’ Carnival
boasted a big “draw” in the visitJ of Gov. and
Ladv Brassey, accompanied by Admiral Bridge
and Aide Shaftesbury. The vice-regal couple
proved liberal customers, and, in return, w.
ESdSrrf from pillar to post bj; a «t ot -oms«
who counted the very strawberries they ate, ana
audibly criticised the lady’s dress and the scanti-
ness of hubby’s auburn locks.
* * *
People who pictured Lady Brassey as a
piddv°eirl -bride have already rectified that esti-
mate! ? To the casual observer, at all events, there
is little, if any, disparity between the appearance
of the hale “ bounder baron and that ot
amiable-faced though rather worn-looking wife,
whose dark hair is plentifully streaked with g y.
# * •
Social costumieres have created wide-
spread feminine excitement and masculine uneasi-
ness by industriously-circulated rumors regarding
Lady Brassey’s alleged “ dressiness and rooted
objection to wearing the same gown twice, i »ese
statements have been borne out to a slight
extent by the recent appearance on the B!ock ot
the personage in question, and her step-daughter,
both wearing macaw-like costumes.

such a transfer is
about the best thing
that could happen

S.A. Gov. Buxton’s reception was a very
slow affair, and the cheers and enthusiasm alleged
by the press were mostly imaginary. The
Governor is a much older man than would appear
by his portraits, but there is no mistaking his
evangelical face. He made his best impression as
a speaker, in which particular he_ is far above
Kintore. As an orator, he is as deliberate and as
impressive as a temperance lecturer, but he calls
Governor “ Governah ” and speaker “ speakah.
H.E. also resembles the average lecturer in wait-
ing at the impressive points for applause.
There was an element of cheapness about the
reception. The Protector, the S.A. warship, was
manned bv a volunteer crew, and fired a salute
out of obsolete guns. The police escort consisted
of men who should have been off duty, and who
received no extra pay for extra work ; the militia
received a reduced allowance for the day s duty ;
the civil servants were in blazing uniforms, but
mostly borrowed or hired, and even H.E. himself
had had his screw cut down the previous week to
.£4OOO p.a. Which accounts for the lack of
enthusiasm in the proceedings.

puzzled to know where to send their orders, so
many drapery Hnns are advertising what they can

My Dear Moorabinda —
A notable Cup festival was the charity ball in
aid of the Melbourne district nursing society,
held in Melb. Town Hall last Thursday—notable
principally because it introduced the Brasseys in
a terpsichorean sense. The new Governor, in
evening kit, looked like Ryley’s Duke “In Town,”
seen sideways in a soup-ladle ; but I didn’t like
his way of wearing his order—like a necktie with
the bauble hanging d la woman’s locket from
beneath the conventional white dress-necktie-bow.
It was a gory ribbon, too, and suggested that the
brand-new Gov. had cut his throat in despair
before starting. From all exterior signs it looks
as if Gov. Brassey would be horribly popular—for
one thing, his way of dancing is so hearty. No
tips-of-fingers.turning for his Victorian Ex., who
grabbed his partner warmly round thewaist, though
she was a splinter-shaped matron of not more than
the average official beauty, and the dance was an
otherwise frigid vice-regal set. Also, Gov. B. is
of the exuberant school of dancing which marks
the time with a stamp and advances to meet a
partner head-first, and this sort of thing goes, you
know, in a land of barn-dancers.
I thought Lady Brassey looked very well in
grey and sunbeam-yellow brocade with yellow
crSpe sleeves and a large yellow feather fan—for,
of course, she couldn’t help the committee bouquet
no!"harmonising, and she wore most of her dia-
monds on her head. Lady B. is a waltzing gover-
noress, and “warmed the floor ” for the fifth
waltz by taking a few lightning twists with the
ugliest aide, who was, of course, an earl. You
can generally spot Vere de Vere in these degene-
rate days by his striking resemblance to a death’s-
head. The aides are not a fatally fascinating
bevy. One looks like a schoolboy—another has
ears like fans and the facial expression of a puzzled
flying-fox, while yet another could always make a
living figuring as a fearful result of not taking so-
and-so’s elixir.
Lady Clarke adorned the long-drawn out dais
at the ball which I believe I am talking about,
and was apparently in the seventh heaven be-
cause her combination of colors was the same as
Lady Brassey’s. Another amusing thing was the
spectacle of a girl ingenuously pinning down a
naval man’s necktie in the middle of the ballroom.
A sprinkling of Sydneyites turned up, including a
Sydney beauty in white and pink, who seemed to
be suffering from an unusual rush of blank spaces
to her dance-card ; but most of the Sydney con-
tingent stood around on one foot, and appeared to
hang fire from a terpsichorean point of view,
,hougb, as I saw men promenading with a girl on
( ach arm, perhaps a plus of petticoats had some-
thing to do with it.
Derby Day at Flemington made a good drapery
* how, taking it by and large—not that everybody
h ad her Sunday frock on, for there were lots of
weet simplicity in cambric—a material which is
s out of place on a racecourse as it would be in a
all-room. One fair damsel in a blush-pink cotton
was pretty enough to carry it off, but others ought
to have remembered that only beauty is privileged
to go unadorned and still make a splash. A
homely woman never looks so hopeless as she does
in white muslin with a red rose in her bowsprit.
The vice-regal box showed plenty of primal color.
Lady Brassey (whose portraits are too young for
her—she has two Kyrle-Bellewish intervals of grey
in her hair, just over each ear) presented rather a
tuppence-colored effect in royal purple silk, with
cheese-color lace collars, a toque with crimson
roses in it, a white fall with a black spot, and a
cheese-color umbrella. The flowers presented to
her en route by a loyal mayoralty were left in the
carriage, by the way—which quite supports the
idea that you can tell what a woman thinks of
you by the way she treats the flowers you give her.
The vice regal box was not over-crowded, Mrs.
Freeman Thomas wore mauve and white, with a
hat mercifully matching; Lady Maud Warrender
(who appears to be a sort of cultivated Vital
Spark) wore pale-grey silk with pink flowers on
top, giving something the effect of a rosy cockatoo,
and another denizen of the V.R. enclosure wore
widie black and white stripes d la zebra. The
V.R. youths were not desperately effective, I
thought their race garments showed signs of hav-
ing been not wanted on the voyage, and so had
found time to settle into other than fashionable
creases. Even Gov. Brassey himself, with a
white boutonniere, was hardly up-to-date about
the hat-brim. And, apropos of the Governor’s
box, I really was surprised to see Rear-Admiral
Cyprian Bridge sunning himself therein. Despite
good resolutions, the navy can no more keep away
from Flemington in November than a oat can
keep away from cream.
Lady Holled Smith wore black satin, with a
wall-paper pattern in strawberry pink, and
trimmed with butter-color lace—a crushed-straw-
berry hat trimmed with black and white chiffon
and a butter-color aigrette. Orepon was very
popular—Mrs. Edward Millar wore a lemon-color
gown made of wool orepon ; Mrs. Bowes Kelly a
black cr4pon skirt with a pink shot-silk blouse.
The blouse effect had many followers at the
Derby, though it never presents a full-dress
appearance—there is always more or less of a
“ reach -me - down ” air about it, I think.
But, judging from the number of smart people
who wore it at Flemington, we are in for a skirt-
and-blouse summer. Mrs. Percy Chirnside wore
an artistically-blended garment in fawn-color and
pale-blue, and Miss Mary Clarke’s white satin,
sprinkled with roses, was like Dresden china.
Decima Moore, squired by Cecil Hope, turned
up in black and silver and a Hamlet hat; Miss
Elsie Cameron (Mrs. J. R. Cowell) wore a bluey-
green checked silk blouse over a peacock-blue
erepon skirt.
The Sydney contingent was not exceedingly
spruce. Miss Nellie Hill wore dark-blue with a
white bird’s-eye dot, white chiffon front and white
gloves to the elbow —hat in yellow and black ;
Miss Florrie Hill a dark skirt and a grey-and-
black check silk blouse with a splotch of coxcomb-
red in her hat; another Sydney spinster wore a
dismal snuff-color suit. Also, a Jersey-haired
Sydneysider unwisely wore green with a crimson
pattern like a fire in a grass-paddock ; but Mrs.
W. B. Mitchell’s Derby dress suggested dewy
cobwebs or melted pearls. Miss Macarthur also
wore grey softened with white chiffon which be-
came her to aT. There was no particular color
prominent at the Derby.
I cannot say I approved in toto of the Derby
man, from a modish standpoint; taking the aver-
age, there was too much straw-hat and sac-coat
visible. And while Guvmentouse is a power in
the land, a chappie who hasn’t a coat to his heels,
a curly brim to his hat, and a boutonniere like a
catherine-wheel, cannot be considered a chappie,
don’tcherknow. But men are becoming such rare
birds nowadays, that they are getting careless
how they dress. Women preponderated in the
Derby crowd to an amazing extent—which is one
of the worst results of the male exodus to Gool-
gardie, I suppose. No wonder Melbourne women
are bringing breeohes-of-promise actions against
the executors of their dead deceivers.

Visitors to the Spouting Spring at Heli-
don, 70 miles from Brisbane, are always astounded
at the quantity of water they can consume at the
Spring. Ten or 12 tumblers in an hour or so are
taken with comfort. The reason is that the
tissues of the body are absorbing the water all the
time. Something beneficial is always added to
the system by every glass of Helidon Spa water
consumed. Messrs. Tooth and Co., Kent
Brewery, are the Sydney agents.
Better than Gold.
There are but few things in this world more
highly appreciated or eagerly sought after than
gold. Why? Not because it is an attractive
color; not because it weighs more than any other
metal; not because it lengthens life. No. But
it brings the necessaries, and, if plentiful, the
luxuries of life. It gives a certain social standing
to its possessor; it brings friends, flattery, and
smiles, and veneers ungentlemanly, or even other-
wise questionable actions, and smooths pathways
otherwise rough. But when the dear wife, or son,
or daughter lies stricken with pain and feebleness;
when disease racks the mind and body; when the
dear one loses that natural buoyancy, sparkle,
energy, and vitality ; then the glitter of gold
becomes almost repulsive ; its uselessness brings a
loathing. Mr. W. R. Lawson, of the firm of
Lawson & Grieve, the well-known shoeing forge,
Oamperdowu, Viet., says : “ While suffering from
constantly recurring attacks of lumbago, which
were little short of continuous, I tried all sorts of
remedies without effect, including injections of
morphia, which only acted temporarily in allaying
pain but produced no permanent improvement,
and my medical was incapable of relieving
me. I then commenced Warner’s Safe Cure, and
although it may seem strange I actually felt relief
from the first dose 1 took, and when I had finished
taking one bottle I was all right again. I feel
much pleasure in stating that I attribute my re-
covery to this medicine alone.” To him, as to
thousands of others, it hasproven better than gold.*
SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Trier came as a boon and a blessing to the
main body of N.S. W. punters last Saturday. They all
backed Messrs. Brennan and Noake’s horse for the Hotham
Handicap, whereas few of them won over Hindoo for the
Coburg Stakes. The runner-up, Reconstruction, was the
popular Sydney fancy that time.
Anyone judging the Derby horses by their looks
alone would have picked Osculator, Auraria, and Wallace
to beat Waterfall and the four rank outsiders of the
crowd. Certainly Osculator has an ugly lump, said to be
“callus,” on one of his knees, but otherwise the big
colt from Maoriland is as handsome as they breed ’em.
Fine and large proportions, nice head, and rich,
dark bay coat with four black points. A show
animal spoilt by the knee blemish aforesaid. Aura-
ria is rather more taking in appearance than Wallace,
and perhaps lime may show that the Derby race
was not a fair test of the relative merils of the three in a
li mile struggle. The Derby was distinctly slow for the
first three furlongs, and very fast for the remaining nine.
Waterfall seemed outclassed. The meanest - looking
animal in the field, he finished at the tail-end. Yet this
same Waterfall, with a light weight up, had run the same
distance at Caulfield in lOsec. less time, only a fortnight
earlier. So much for time trials, public or private.
Hova won the Melbourne Stakes in remarkably
easy style. A furlong from home jockey Jimmy Hayes
was holding his mount back and glancing from right to
left of him as though cocksure of being able to “ leave
ttie others standing still” at any moment. When Hova
got the hint to clear right away from the field the race
was ail over. Nevertheless, Music’s manner of running
second suggested that he might have a lot to do with the
finish for the Cup. Ruenalf, last year, beat Patron over
the Stakes mile and a quarter almost as easily as Hova
took them down on Saturday.
Mr. Sam Cook’s horses appear to be under a cloud
again. The Heroine is still lame from a mishap in the Caul-
field Cup. The Officer made a very poor show for the Mari-
byrnong, and perhaps is not nearly the colt they thought
him. At Caulfield there were two lots of two-year-old
“form.” The Officer, Thunder Queen and Norroy
finished in front for the Debutant Stakes (four furlongs),
whilst Newhaven, Coil and Kobold filled places in the
Nursery Handicap (4J furlongs). When it came to the
Maribyrnong sprint of five furlongs. Newhaven, Coil
and Kobold ran as before in a field of seven, Officer,
Norroy, and Thunder Queen being beaten out of places.
Ariki, the seventh straggler, was unplaced in each of the
three races, and so helped to make all the running look
genuine.
Whatever the real quality of Wallace as a racer,
there is no getting away from the fact that Mr. Wilson’s
chestnut ’orse had a great reputation before it was earned.
Sentiment and the gags of sporting journalism shortened
Wallace’s price for the Derby. He was “ the illustrious
son of Carbine,” with “ his sire’s disinclination to canter
to the starling-post,” and an alleged tendency to get
“ more like his dad every day,” and so forth. Also, the
touts swore that Wallace has “ the machine-like action of
his great progenitor,” which he certainly hasn't. The
sensational lottery colt is a true descendant of Musket in
the matter of sluggishness, but, when roused, he doesn’t
gallop with the wonderful Carbine and Carnage stride.
Carnage, at his best, was a far more attractive mover than
Wallace.
Lady Brassey “ did ” the saddling-paddook
with enthusiasm on Derby day. Governor B. showed no
special interest in horseflesh, but his spouse gazed at the
favorites through her double eyeglasses as though she
were trying to form a fancy on her own. The suite
johnnies in attendance also seemed to be in a turfy frame
of mind. One of them stroked Auraria’s nose with all
the confidence of a new-chum who doesn’t know that the
racehorses of this unculohawed country have a dislike to
kid gloves, as a rule, and a natural disposition to bite any
strange hand that wears one. Luckily, Auraria is the
most amiable filly 'going, and a puffed lydy. She
wouldn’t hurt even an aide-de-camp.
The new rule at Flemington of bringing the
Derby and Cup winners down the quiet course, instead of
among the Lawn mob, to be blue-ribboned, is an improve-
ment in every way. It gives the Governoress a chance to
accomplish her fell purpose without getting very hot over
it, and provides an amusing little incident for the people
on the Hill and Flat, who, of yore, couldn’t catch a
glimpse of the ceremony. Wallace and Lady Brassey
tickled the Hill’s fancy on Saturday. Each unsuccessful
attempt to lassoo the noble steed with his badge of total
abstinence fetched a round of applause. The horse played
to the gallery, and the lady was a novice at the business.
Besides, the effect of the bright blue ribbon against her
violet costume was not soothing. At last the badge got
there, assisted by Gov. Brassey, and the multitude let off
a cheer which signified “ encore.”
The Brassey triumphal barouche and fittings are
preferred by Smellbourne’s bong-tong to the late Hope-
toun equipage. Hopeloun used to cut a dash in Lord
Mayor style, with his heavy blue-and-yellow chariot and
flunkeys to match. Gov. B. goes in for the subdued
splendour of a ohocolate-and-white turn-out, which har-
monises with the buff-and-brown of the Mounted Rifles,
and melts into the sun-baked sward, so to speak. A
Governor can’t be too careful in such matters. Judging
from several remarks passed on Saturday, The Bulletin
would say that the Brassey kerridge will inspire a lot of
ardent loyalty to the British Crown.
This is perhaps the first Cup-time within the
memory of Melbourne’s oldest snob that the vice-regal
box at Flemington has been free from visiting Governors.
The writer has a fevered recollection of five ruling per-
sonages sitting in that same pen, all in a row. It was a
most brilliant spectacle, but perhaps somewhat too
exciting.

Melbourne is a city flowing with beer, tucker,
tobacco, doubles, and dead-beats:— (a) “ For Gourmands:
Half-pint beer, plate of hot ourry-and-rice, and sausage-
roll, 2d.” (6) “For Sportsmen: Beer or rum, cigar,
counter-lunch, and pick your own double (£l5 to
nothing), 3d.” The above is the programme at several
reputable pubs.

A day or two after his arrival, Gov. Brassey,
accompanied by several ladies and aides, went for a row
on the Ynrra in the sumptuous pleasure-boat he brought
with him in the Sunbeam. Just opposite Brander’s Ferry
a four-oared club race was coming down, and as the north
side boat drew opposite the vice-regal party, bow had his
oar knocked violently out of his hand. At that moment
there arose in the wake of the racing boat and a few feet
from the stern of the Sunbeamers’ skiff, a corpse which
rode upright in the water as if anchored to the bottom,
and which swayed to and fro, its head bowing homage to
the new Governor. But the incident had no novelty.
Gov. Brassey had already been welcomed by the stiff.
* • • •
As all-round sports Gov. Brassey and his wife
promise to eclipse anything yet seen in the vice-regal
line. In the first week of their Melb. residence they have
been seen yachting, hunting, cycling and rowing.

Writes “Scrip” Wallace’s great battle with
the Maorilander, Osculator, brought to mind his sire’s
nip-and-tuck tussle with Ensign, seven years ago, in the
same race, when a short head won the money, as on
Saturday. The youngster had better luck than his dad,
but he had to stretch his neck to some purpose. It was a
slow-run race in the early stages, just as Ensign’s was,
but the last six furlongs were skipped over in 1.16 and a
fraction. Wallace, although exhibiting many points in
the matter of quality, from a horsey man’s point of view,
looks small and mean-looking when compared with the
majestic Maorilander.
Osculator belongs to a M.L. bookie, and is yet a
maiden, with two places to his credit. Distance is his
forte —he never gets going until after a mile or so.
It was a slow-run Derby, the time, 2.46, being
7seo. behind the record held jointly by Trident and
Carnage.
The first three in “ the ribbon ” are by sons of
Musket—Carbine, Hotchkiss, and Trenton. Hotchkiss
never raced, but is beginning to make a name for himself
at the stud.
The Derby contest was essentially interpro-
vincial in character. The trio in the honors list, after the
official placing, represented Victoria, M.L., and S.A.
N.S.W. was out of it.
The erst owners of Wallace get .£5OO out of the
Derby Stake, besides the £2500 paid them by Mr. Wilson
for re-possession.
Coil was unable to bring Maribyrnong Plate
stake to N.S. W., as Arihi did last year. Newhaven, the
winner, is a taking colt, with credentials for classic con-
tests next year. The Officer found his added burden too
cumbersome. Wallace ran third in this event last season.
As the Derby field was pulling up it was dis-
covered that the first letters in the names of the placed
three spelt Woa.
Hova’s brilliancy is indisputable. He is un-
doubtedly the best pacer in the colonies, and, Carbine-
line. weight or distance doesn’t trouble him. He won
Melb. Stakes in an ordinary garden canter, smothering
his field most ridiculously. Hova’s sire, Ingomar, was
imported to M.L. from Ireland, where he was a champion
under colors. Had he lived, and been afforded the same
opportunities, there was every promise of his proving a
second Musket at the stud.
The cracking-up tactics adopted by the rider of
Hopscotch at Caulfield were again resorted to in Melb.
Stakes, with similar result. It was thought that a-quarter
mile shorter course would favor him in the pace-making
racket, and enable him to win from start to post. Field-
leading, with the object of galloping the rest to a stand-
still, isn’t always the policy it's cracked up to be, even in
the case of a good horse. Hova’s jock wasn’t frightened
of getting blocked in. He rode with the rest, and kept
his eye skinned.
Osculator carried more M.L. money in the
Derby than Carbine did when he contested the race.
Both had bad luck, heads deciding the stake against
them.
Maribyrnong Plate field this year was excep-
tionally small, only seven running. There were 30 in ’Bl,
when Segeuhoe won. As a rule, there are about a dozen
starters, but in ’7l, when the event was inaugurated, only
four paid up.
The erst owner of St. Alban’s only raffled his
equine string to buy most of them back again. He bought
six at the sale, including Challenger (£500) and Carbine’s
dam, Mersey (£300). C. M. Lloyd, understood to be also
buying for Wilson, secured six lots, including Havoc
(±1650) and Aura (dam of Auraria). Trainer M'Dnnald
was also a buyer. The surprise of the sale was Strath-
more going at 300 guineas. Carnage’s owner expected
over a thousand instead of half that amount. Mr. Wilson
will still race and breed, and Wallace has set things going
for him first time of asking.
The new owners of St. Alban’s don’t quite know
what to do with it. They will probably sell—if anyone
can be found in Melbourne with enough cash to buy.
Honda is about the unluekiest horse in Aus-
tralia. Though he got second in a Melb. Cup he is still a
maiden, and on Saturday he fell in the bigrace, and broke
his jockey’s arm.
* * ♦ »
Auraria, which The Bulletin tipped to win
both Derby and Cup, so far lived up to this paper’s faith
in her that she ran third in the Derby behind Wallace
and Osculator, and won the Melbourne Cup in good
style, with Hova second, an obscure animal named
Burrabari third, and Waterfall fourth. Auraria is
only the second mare to win the Melbourne Cup,
Briseis, in 1876, being the other one. This means only
two wins by mares in 36 years. Auraria is a three-year-
old daughter of Trenton-Aura, and she comes from South
Australia, which is morally rough on that evangelical
province and its evangelical Gov. In Auraria’s win may
be seen the linger of the Devil—luring Fowell-Buxton on
to the Turf.
* * * •
The Melb. sporting pressman who won Eureka
in the St. Alban’s lottery was not one of the very lucky
fellows. Eureka, under the hammer, realised 16 guinea?
only.
♦ ♦ » *
The fame of owning a share in Wallace didn’t
stay long with the members of the lucky syndicate,
Photos, of Messrs. House and English were supplied to
the press on the day that W. R. Wilson bought their prize
back from them. The two up-country sports made s
wise deal.
* • * •
Chief Secretary Peacock was called in to wit-
ness the transfer of Wallace by the syndicate to Wilson.
Peacock is the member for their district, but he takes so
little interest in horse-racing that the momentous tran-
saction had to be explained to him. As official head of
the Vic. police dept, he was somewhat shocked to hear
that a racehorse had been publicly svveeped.
♦ * ♦ v
Mr. Arundell, who won Trenton in the St.
Alban’s lottery, was formerly clerk to Messrs. Davies and
Campbell, of Melbourne, solicitors to the Modern Building
Society. The society is a creditor of Mr. Arundell, and
has injuncted Mr. W. R. Wilson not to deliver the horse.
However, Mr. ArundelTs creditors have agreed to respect
his wife's half-share in the lottery-ticket, and all will end
harmoniously.
* * * *
The head teachers of Prahran (Vic.) asked the
local Board of Advice to make Cup-day a school-holiday.
The Board did so without a murmur. This action would
not have been allowed to pass without opposition from
the pious party, had the heart nett been taken out of them
by the unholy alliance contracted between the clergy and
the bookmakers when the Totalisator Bill was brought
before Parliament. In previous years, for weeks before
the racing carnival, a score of pulpits thundered simul-
taneously against the Curse of Gambling. This year the
parsons are dumb as oysters, being wretchedly aware
that they have placed themselves in a grotesquely false
position. The bookmakers have won a double in this
case. Tney got the help of the parsons against the
totalisator, and, by doing so, closed the mouths of their
allies in regard to their (the bookmakers’) own soul-
destroying trade. Taken altogether, it is a great year for
Ikey Mo.
♦ * ♦ ♦
It seems that the indifferent performance of
Challenger, on Caulfield Cup day, was nartly excused by
a split hoof, or something. At the St. Alban’s lottery-
sale W. R. Wilson paid 500 guineas for the repossession of
this showy colt, notwithstanding its hollow back and non-
staying appearance.

which is to be cited Carbine, a favorite, who won with

The cruellest cut of all was Hartley Williams
having to act as Chief Justice Madden’s bottle-
washer in administering the Brassey oath.
In the old cemetery, Campbelltown (N.S.

cords that she had eight children at a birth.
Ex-Premier Shiels, long time on the sick-
list, put in an appearance at the Vic. Assembly
last week and contributed to the praises of J. B.
Patterson.
Byron Miller, the
Launceston (Tas.) barri-
ster, was called out of
town once to defend a
girloharged with larceny.
She was an orphan and
served in a respected
family, in consideration
of which she was clothed
and fed. For some small
sin she was discharged,
and her room searched
by one of the ladies, who
unearthed a bundle of
linen tied up ready for
the road. The orphan
was given in charge and
stated to the police that
the Misses gave her
the linen for clusters.
Things were looking very
blue for the slavey, when
-some charitable person
sent for Miller. At the
enquiry the lawyer or-
dered the bundle to be
spread out, and various
mouldy - looking articles
were cl isplayed before
the admiring gaze of the
court. One “duster”
was a particularly dis-
reputable garment of
ladies’, underwear, and
this Miller dangled in
mid-air with much feel-
ing. “ Can anyone,” said
Byron solemnly, “ Can
anyone believe that such
a garment as this can
belong, or has ever be-
longed, to one of the
Musses——?” The ladies
would not identify and
the girl was discharged.
Rev. Leonard Isitt,
of Maoriland, the Boan-
erges of total prohibition,
is in London preparing
for a wrestle with the
Drink Fiend. The half-
penny papers are para-
graphing him as a man
of “splendid instincts”
with “ the presence of a
Dan O’Connell,” who
“carries away his audi-
ences with a wild rush of
torrential oratory.” The
Sun says he has “abullet-
shaped, pugnacious-look-
ing head and strong
frame.” They are all
built that way.
The very first advice Gov. Brassey got
from the Vic. Executive was that he should not
interfere with the decision to hang Mrs. Williams,
It is news to hear that “Fifty Years in
the. Making of Australian History ” really brought
ex-Premier Parkes .£4OOO. The publishers pro-
bably didn’t make much more than that.

A new C. of E. missionary diocese is to

Mayor Snowden welcomed Gov. Brassey

tion which thinks 4s. lid. a good day’s pay for a

Beeronet Buxton was born within a few
months of the day that S.A. was proclaimed a
British province, and Baron Brassey was born in
the year that Melbourne was founded.
Gov. Buxton, it is said, was converted
from the drink-traffic at the same time as his
brewery. Buxton became a teetotaller, and the
brewery was converted into a company.
Dr. Andrew Garran, journalist and poli-
tician, is one of a family of 13 boys and girls.
Which perhaps accounts for the ill-luck of N.S.W.
Government Bills in the Upper House.
At Dromana (Yic.), where with her hus-
band she settled in 1841, the other day died Mrs.

hale and hearty, is 96.
Mark Twain turned up at the big Melb.
wool-sales one day last week, and “ remained an
interested spectator for half-au hour.” Feeling

It was half expected that Gov. Brassey
would, on his own initiative, officially frown upon
certain Smelbourne land-boomsters if he got the
chance. He had the chance, at his first levee, and
missed it.
All the Governors of Australasia now are
either peers or closely related to the peerage :
Glasgow, Gormanston (who has just contrived to
sit down hard on a big fish-hook), Brassey, Hamp-

daughter) and Smith, who is an Earl’s cousin.

THE DEPRAVITY OF CHARTERS TOWERS.
“Well, Charlie , hour do you know to-day is Sunday?”
“ 'Cause there will be a football-match to-day.”
Buxton these words appeared : “ H.E. the Lieut. -
Governor’s arrival at 2.50 pan. sharp.” That
wicked Kingston !
N.S.W. Judge Backhouse seems to have a
knack of getting into a mess on critical occasions.
He made a memorable mistake at the trial of the
Broken Hill rioters at Deniliquin, which mistake,
by the way, w'as hotly resented by Mr. Want,
who defended the prisoners.
Brewer Simms, one of the few S.A.
millionaires, travelled from England with Gov.
Buxton. They must have had many pleasant
chats about beer —that being the only connecting
link between them. For Simms is a sporting man
and knows nothing of Evangelicalism.
The N.S. v\. Attorney-General and the
Minister for Just-ice, in their defence of Justice
Backhouse’s release of attorney Rofe, dub that
criminal “ a lad.” Rofe is a married man and a
father. But then, as “Jack” Want said in the
Leg. Council, “ they start early m this country.”
Henry Palmer, the young fireman who
bravely carried the line ashore at the Wairarapa
wreck, was killed on a dredge in the Molyneaux
lately. Getting down from the water-tank, in-
stead of using the ladder he started over the
machinery and got jammed in the wheels, dying
in great agony.
It was a pretty and edifying sight at the
first Brassey levee to observe the purple-robed
R.C. Archbishop Carr and the academic-hooded
Presbyterian Moderator Rentoul chatting together
as amicably as if they bad never said a hard word
about each other in the newspapers. When the
augurs meet —they smile.
“I think we’ll start a matrimonial
agency,” remarked Hugh Taylor after having, at
the altar, given Mrs. Parkes No. 3 a smack on the
>heek like the drawing of a champagne-cork.
“Parkes and Taylor, Matrimonial Agents,” would
.ook well on a brass plate, Taylor finding the
capital, and P arkes the experience.
Gov. Brassey’s son-in-law, Freeman
Thomas, is an appropriate family connection, and
an indirect proof of the “golden Sunbeamer’s ”
good sense. Miss Brassey married into the con-
tract-business plutocracy, in which the original
Thomas and Freeman (partners) are big names.
That was better than buying a hungry earl.
W. T. Pinhe.y, Deputy Coroner, a N.S.
Wales settler of 60 years’ standing, died the
other day, aged 75. Mr. Pinhey succeeded to the
pharmacy business of Ambrose Eoss, who in turn
purchased from the notorious woman-poisoner,
John Tawell, the first man in England arrested
for murder by means of the electric telegraph.
Sydney Sunday Times penlady ;
I have been looking over his (ex-Preinier Parkes’) poems
to see whether he has addressed any to his present wife,
but can’t find even the slightest reference. Doubtless,
however, there are some unpublished poems.
The idea of looking over a writer’s poems to see
whether during his late wife’s lifetime he addressed
any poetry to his housemaid is indeed delicious.
A long journey by rail, even under the
most pleasant conditions, becomes a tedious affair.
It’s right enough for 3O miles or so, but,
when you have read all the comic papers, dis-
cussed every topic under the sun, political, social,
and athletic ; decided what is to be done with the
Upper House, lost a few shillings at nap, counted
the number of telegraph-poles to the mile, had a
smoke, lost a few shillings at 100, then you begin
to yawn and look round fora spot to stretch your-
self in for a godd sleep. Lucky you are if you
have brought a good rug wit’i you—such a one,
say, as Mark Foy, of Oxford-street, Sydney,
offers. Another excellent adjunct in a railway-
journey is a sound, substantial, stylish portman-
teau or Gladstone bag. You may be a great
traveller, but you will v travel far before you find
such value in bags and rugs as at Mark Toy’s.*
Ex-Premier Patterson, at the Yic. Com-
mercial Travellers’ Club, a few days ago :
“Permit me to say that we have become accus-
tomed to laugh at our political enemies, and when
you are prepared to laugh at your political
enemies, then you ought to be removed to some
better world.” And now the ex-Premier is dead.
Capt. Broomfield,
of Sydney, equally
well-known as a min-
ing man and as a
memberof the Marine
Board, is 74 years old
and sole survivor of
22 who gained a mas-
ter-mariner’s certifi-
cate with him in ’45.
He first came to Syd-
ney as third mate of
the Cressy, which
brought 300 convicts,
and he was the
means of saving the
vessel from the rocks
near the Cape, and
the convicts testi-
monialised him. One
of the convicts de-
veloped into a pros-
perous Melbourne
merchant. As mas-
ter of the Phoebe,
Capt. B. brought 300
Irish girls (all con-
victs), ranging from
17 to 70 years of age,
out to Hobart.
Though many were
very pretty, all be-
haved well coming
out—so says the ve-
teran captain. Going
up the Derwent the
lighter containing
them swamped, but
the third mate (they
had infused to get
into the lighter unless
he escorted them)
avoided any disaster
by employing the
whale-boats. Capt.
Broomfield has vivid
recollections of Syd-
ney in the early days
—of the Tank-stream,
then Sydney’.- water-
supply, flowing past
where the General
Post - office stands
now; of the penny
bridge spanning the
swamp between the
present Custom
House site and
George - street of
George - street itself
with scarcely a two-
storey building, and
thechain-gangs work-
ing in it all day long, and the bullock-teams
for tire interior reaching from the Royal Hotel to
Petersham, and the swearing thereof reaching to
the Blue Mountains. There were two churches
with preachers worth mentioning—nobody
cared. The Garandinis sang and danced at
the old Victoria, and the sign of British
justice was raised upon Gallows Hill. In
those days the aristocracy often rode to Home-
bush racecourse and back in carriages drawn by
dogs. Melbourne in ’47, when the Captain’s ship,
Sarah Scott, rodeall alone in Port Phillip, was so
embryonic that it hadn’t begun to smell. The
one wharf—Cole’s dock, just below the Falls—
was reached by a lighter. Gov. Latrobe gave th»
first Melbourne vice-regal ball at the opening oi
the first Melbourne arcade, and Capt. Broomtielr
attended in the spirit of a mariner bold, and ir
the get-up of a wild Indian. In ’54, the Oaptaii
took the first cargo of wool from Brisbane b
London in the ship Asa Packer. Brisbane ther
gave no sign or whisper of its present civilisatioi
—North Brisbane was a handful of houses ; Soutl
Brisbane a shanty or two ; the clear river flower
between. The Captain remembers the first go or
diggings at Ophir, near Orange, N.S.W., and wha
a day it was for the finder and the liar, for th-
oz. find and owt. report. He was by when G
A. Lloyd sold by auction the first gold—a lot
of 460 z. In Sydney Museum there is a sword-
fish which nearly settled the Captain’s ship as
she was coming from the Islands. Perhaps the
most adventurous act of the Captain’s life was to
bring the 20-ton Petrel from ’Frisco to Sydney
with one seaman and one passenger. The pas-
senger was Mr. Young, of the A.J.S. Bank,
brother to N.S.W. Works-Minister Young.
The correct Melbourne pronunciation of
Gov. Brassey’s name was determined by the
rising generation on the day of his arrival. Brass-
eye. What cheer, Brass-eye ?
Thb Bulletin’s History of the Dean Case
mailed to any address in New South Wales for
fid ; Australasia, 6|d ; foreign, 7d. in stamps.
A Fiji sugar-planter, on a visit to Sydney,
brought Ids black boy with him. He took him to
Mort’s Dock, and showed him the mighty
machinery at work ; he led him to the summit of
the Post-office, and pointed out the vast panorama
at his feet; he made him listen at the phonograph
to the playing of a brass band ; he let him press
the button to turn on the electric light of a big
building; but nothing of all the wonderful
achievements of science excited his surprise
except the clock of Delarue’s watch-shop in
George-street, the gong of which is manipulated
by the wooden figure of a negro. That appealed
to him. This stolidity is particularly characteris-
tic of the Chinese and Japanese races. They
refuse to be surprised. But a little Jap who
strolled into Mark Toy’s the other day was very
much astonished when some beautiful Japanese
white silk, 23 and 27 inches wide, was set before
him at Is. o|d. and Is. 4|d. a yard. His dark
eyes opened in an incredulous manner, for not
even in Japan had he ever seen such value.*
The ladies-powdered, perfumed, lacey—
Take special pains to call him “ Bracey,”
The while their husbands, stout and gassy,
Are proud to shake the hand of Brassey.'
But boys, who pause to see him nass, liie
Uo»n the street, exclaiming “ Brass h’Eye!

POLITICAL
POINTS
When the Reid Ministry falls it will pro-
bably be Attorney-General Want or Minister
Gould, or both together, who will have smashed it.
Colonial Secretary Buckley, of Maoriland,
is an advocate of a State liquor monopoly. Un-
luckily, Buckley is too mild and.beautiful to advo-
cate anything very seriously.
Melb. evening paper supplies two items
re the demise of J. B. Patterson. “His place
can never be filled.” . , “A large number of
candidates will contest the vacant seat.”
What is now happening in Newcastle
(N.S.W.) district recalls the American economist
m mm
%
THE REAL MACKAY.
MR. M‘MURPHY (licensee of the Deadman’s Trade Hotel, Yalgoo,
stands on the cerandah of his pub. and challenges all
creation to mortal combat): “ Come on, ye curs! The
man that won’t fight after drinking three glasses of MY
rum must be a coward at heart I”
Carey’s assertion: “The country, which limits
itself to the export of raw material must end by
exporting its men.”
Most of the city letters to S.A. provincial
journals are written from the 11 kgister office, and
the result is that outsiders get the idea that there
is a consensus of metropolitan opinion adverse to
Premier Kingston and his Government.
Premier Reid now asserts that the N.S. W.
Council has no right to amend the Land and
Income-tax Assessment Bill. Just four months
ago the same wobbler said that it iiad the right,
and that the Assessment Bill had been sent up
separate from the actual taxation bill expressly
that the Council might exercise that right.
Three members of the Vic. Cabinet, Pea-
cock, Taverner, and Foster, may be considered to
have preserved their self-respect by car. fully stay-
ing away from every meeting held to consider the
fate of Emma Williams,-and leaving the job chiefly
to the lawyers of the 1 Cabinet. At time of wilt-
ing, The Bulletin does not know whether a post-
mortem was held to settle the question of the
Woman’s pregnancy, nor whether, if such a post-
mortem was held, it was attended by any but the
official doctors.
Governors Laniington, Hampden, Buxton,
and Brassey were all members of the Imperial
Federation League of 1888. The simultaneous
convergence of these streams of influence on Aus-
tralia may reasonably be taken as the outcome of
a deliberate imperial purpose. No doubt Gerard
Smith’s heart is imperially in the right place, and
thus Australia is, or will be when the last of this
band arrives, wholly, so far as its highest offices
are concerned, in the control of one particular
British league. Furthermore, the league of ’BB
affirmed that Australian Federation would bring
Imperial Federation one step nearer, and hence
the converging streams of the present possess in-
creased significance.
Almost the last parliamentary statement of
J. B. Patterson, leader of Vic. Opposition, was to
assure Chief-Secretary Peacock that he would lend
a hand to help through the bill for the repression
of sweating. Patterson was a bad politician, a
dunderheaded Minister, and a violent office-
hungerer, but, anyhow, his last political utterance
was worthy of a much wiser man.
One hideous miscarriage of justice follows
another in N.S.W. with startling succession. And
all these gross iniquities go practically unrebuked
and unredressed by Parliament, simply because
the Labor-party has in its mouth a sponge filled
w.thmilk of the cocoanut, and is bound to sup-
port the lawyer-bossed Govt, through thick and
thin. The Legal Ring—that is the real Govern-
ment.
The unkindest thing said about the late
Vic. ex-Premier Patterson was contained in
Premier Turner’s well-meant speech of eulogy.
“ I regret to notice,” said Turner, “ that the ranks
of the men who have worked hard to make the
province what it is are being rapidly thinned.”
Fancy putting that epitaph over your friend’s
grave : “ Here lies a man who worked hard to
make Victoria what it is ! ”
Attorney - General
Want has the gall to “ re-
gret that N.S.W. Council
has fallen into the same bad
habit as the other Chamber
in attempting to interfere
| with the administration of
' justice.” This in regard to
the Rofe case ! The ad-
ministration of what?
The com pulsory feature
of the Vic. Education sys
tern is thoroughly operative.
Out of the total number of
children between the ages
of 6 nd 13 only 2726 were
unaccounted for last year.
Apropos of the case of
Role, the Sydney solicitor
found guilty of conspiracy
and released under the First
Offenders’ Act, this is more
or less interesting. A day
or two after Rofe’s dis-
charge a man was found
guilty at a Sydney police
court of stealing some small
articles. He had previously
borne an excellent char-
acter ; also, he was out of
work, hungry, stone-broke,
and had a wife to main-
tain, and he stole the goods
in question apparently to
raise a little money for their
maintenance. He also asked
to be released under the
First Offenders’ Act, but
was promptly squashed.
“The Act was never meant
to apply to you, but to
youthful offenders,” said
the Court, and the sentence
was four months’ “ hard.”
Another proof of the dis-
advantage of not being a
lawyer.
After waiting many
days, during which it was
engaged in preparing itself
for investigation, Melb.
Crown Law Department
has announced that a Board
will be appointed to en-
quire into Mr. Lormer’s
indictment of the honorary
magistracy, and that the
onus of proof will rest on
Lormer. As a detective
has been constantly em-
ployed for months examin-
ing the evidence available,
it is generally assumed that
he has reported that it is
not sufficiently formidable
to make enquiry dangerous
or sufficient to save Lormer
from being placed in a false position.
The Seddon Government has suffered many
defeats of late, and its big majority is evidently
becoming demoralised. Its following still amounts
to three fourths of the Assembly, but it seems to
be growing weary of party-government, and only
follows when it thinks it right to do so. And, un-
luckily, Government by Contradiction is based
wholly on the assumption that the party shall
always follow, whether it thinks it right to do so
or not. A Legislature with a conscience makes
the party-system wholly unworkable.
The Nelson (Q.) Govt, started its career
by wielding the axe of reform in three directions.
1. Retrenchment (unsparing) in the Civil-service.
2. Unsparing reduction of Education Vote and raising
of school a^e.
8. Abjuring of political railways and similar abomina-
tions.
But within the last six months the service has
been placated, the school age lowered, political
railways promised all over the country, and every-
body is happy again.
Australians seem unaware that the Northern
Territory of South Australia (one-sixth, and by no
means the worst sixth, of this continent), which a
British company—chiefly the South African gang
—propose to acquire under charter, is “in no wise
an Australian possession.” It belongs to J. Bull,
and is “only being administered by South Aus-
tralia in the Imperial interest.” The company,
which calmly proposes to run the rule over a fifth
of Australia, has been at work in Adelaide for the
last five months, and includes the Rothschilds and
the inevitable Col. North. Now for Federation !
The Maoi’iland Upper House has practi-
cally abolished the Liquor Bill, and the Cold Tea
party is in sackcloth and ashes. The clauses pro-
vidmg for Prohibition throughout the whole pro-
vnice have been abolished, also the half-holidav
on polling day. Instead of absolute local Pro
bibition, power is merely given to reduce the
number of licences; clubs are to be allowed to sell
liquor as heretofore and are not to be affected by
w jne licences are allowed

Australia, it should give a big impetus to Aus-
trahan Federation. The one thing that is wanted
to make f ederation go ahead is a great common
danger, and the establishment in the North of a
mgger-province run on syndicate principles is the
worst danger that Australia is likely to meet with,
ihe misfortune is that the Territory is very
remote from N.S. ~ Victoria, and lasmania, and
the average mhabnant doesn't worry about a
natmnal calamity mini it is actually visible from
Ins own dour.

The lute J. B. PATTLERSOX, ex-Premier of Victoria.
Labor-member Hancock, Vic., had his
feelings hurt the other night by an accusation of
disloyalty : Salmon, M.P., having solemnly in-
formed Vic. Assembly that the member for Foots-
oray refused to rise when “the Queen ” was pro-
posed on the arrival of Gov. Brassey. Hancock
was shocked at the “cowardly charge,” and
excitedly explained that he had not risen to drink
the toast because he had no liquor to drink it
with, but when the liquor was supplied he drank
the Queen “ with great gusto.” Hancock is now
admired as a devoted loyalist who would risk any
ignominy in preference to drinking the “Throne
and Person ” in fresh air.
Ex-Premier Patterson, who died last week,
was the scientific trimmer. Even a trimmer can-
not help having convictions, and Patterson’s were
invincibly Tory, all through his political life. He
began by trying to get in on that racket, under
\,, nrT , „ : • , c
f A * T *’ m tl,e days of Maokmnon the
* lrst - Nofc “Sing able to manage it, he played
fcbe M'Culloch kind of game. He ended in a
genuine way—as the Tory. Had he stuck to
his . convictions throughout life, like Murray
Sm,th > Service, or Berry, he would have been a
powerful man, but he leaves only a reputation of
the somewhat improved Colonel Boots Smith
description. It could be shown that Patterson
ar gued both for and against, in regard to every
£ reat question that has agitated Victoria,
W.: “In Patterson, there were the makings
of a really splendid man. He had nearly all the
essentials of success—insight, pluck, vigorous
humor, cordiality, and any amount of oommon-
sense. But with it there was too much levity, too
much love of the glitter of things, too much
adaptability and short-sighted self-seeking. Demo-
cratie, and gifted with Higinbotham’s directness
of purpose and abhorrence of sham, he would have
been one of the greatest of Australia’s statesmen,
Variable, unreliable, and only a plutocrat in sin-
centy and truth, the people weighed him in the
balance and found him wanting.”
Another interesting event looms
in royal circles. Another Fife to be
added to Queen Victoria’s German
band.
Apropos of nothing. The
very latest definition of “ lady-help ”
is “one who helps herself to her
mistress’s shoes.”
Suicide seems to be coming into
fashion with the British aristocracy.
A Duke of Bedford, an Earl of
Shaftesbury, and a Marquis of
Waterford have wiped themselves out
within the last few years. The latter
was the son of “ wild Waterford,”
whose practical jokes in the forties
and fifties were practical proofs of
insanity.

was delayed till the big visitor went.
At the same time, small coasting
steamers are only allowed to drop
their cargo on the wharfs per medium

business that vessels cannot be allowed

LE ROI S’AMUSE.
The latest English files give us particulars of
the reason of the late general change in Australian
Governors. It seems that Queen Victoria was
worrying a good deal about the lack of “Jingoism’
on the part of the Australian provinces, and one
day she was standing at Lord Salisbury’s side on
the look-out tower of Balmoral Castle, lost in deep
meditation, even the glorious panorama unveiled
at her feet, which is one of the most picturesque
scenes of the world, having no attraction for her.
Suddenly throwing off her despondent mood she
turned round to her companion and said : “Sally,
old boy, the horizon looks gloomy, the silken bonds
with Australia are getting very slack, let us revive
things there by sending out a new lot of
Governors, that will make things 4 hum.’ The
Kangaroolanders are depressed after the bursting
of their various booms, things are only middling,
and the colonists need some distraction.” The
result of this conversation was the appointment of
Viscount Hampden for N.S.W., Lord Brassey
for Victoria. Sir T. E. Buxton for S.A., and
Colonel Smith for Westralia. These nominees
had a meeting and decided to do their utmost to
make the Australians forget their troubles, to
encourage sports, but also to preach thrift as a
means to re-establishing prosperity. They decided
that horse-racing should be discouraged, and to
introduce to both sexes the exhilarating sport of
bicycling in its place. Thrift is to be encouraged
by this means, as they consider the healthy excite-
ment derived from bicycle-riding better than the
glamor of horse-racing at nothing like the expense.
They also decided to advise colonists to drink
less and to smoke less noxious tobaccos, but to
smoke what is now considered the one smoke of
the world, viz., Frossard’s Cavour Cigars. Eng-
lish experience has proved them to be a cheap,
uninjurious enjoyment, unsurpassed anywhere,
and obtainable everywhere in packets of 8 for Is.*
Prof. Loisette, the “assimilative-memory”
man, announces by advfc. in this issue that he is
giving lessons in his system of never forgetting
tilings. Any person who is cursed with a bad
memory and wants it repaired is invited to com-
municate with him and try his system, which has
now been in use for a quarter of a century.
Parsons, the Vic. cyclist who shone so
brightly against Zimmerman, is 10st. weight
stripped, and 21 years old —the age when a man
can sprint and sprint and sprint. He started
path-racing about two years ago, and was thought
a good thing for his first Austral, so remarkably
well had he been riding, but nervousness paralysed
him before the race. He won eight races, ranging
from half to two miles, before last Dec. ; then he
won the 10-mile Vic. Championship, and broke
the world’s grass record with 26min. 15sec. A
few days later he lowered all Australian records
for half-mile upwards to 10 miles ; the track was
the Melbourne Exhibition track; the 10 miles’
time was 23min. 58sec. Last Sep, he won the
Vic. 50 Mile Championship Road Race, and the
Victory Road Race from scratch. At last
Adelaide meeting (before the Zimmerman debut)
he won the half-mile and 10-mile scratch races,
beating Megson and Lewis. He has met Megson
in five scratch races altogether, beaten him twice
in a 10-mile and once in a half-mile race, and been
beaten by Megson in a one-mile championship on
Melbourne cricket-ground and in a five-mile at
Brisbane. He thinks that Zimmerman, fit and
well, is a notch above any Australian. Parsons
rides a Humber.

The New Woman is responsible for much tau-
tology.
The last English election was a pronuncia-
mento against Church Disestablishment in the
unholy alliance of rum and religion. The fact is
the Anglican Church has become so colorless that
it embraces a huge majority of the unbelievers,
who take a pride in its age, and its architecture
and wealth and respectability. Even the upper-
crust of Nonconformism supports the ecclesiastical
establishment. Atheist Moncure Conway wrote an
elaborate magazine article in support of the en-
dowed Church of England.
John Baptist, a “gentleman ob color,”
was “ had ” before the eternal North Melb. court
the other day to show cause why he should not
pay for the maintenance of an illegitimate, which
a young woman alleged against him. Lawyer for
defence: “Complainant has no case, your Wor-
ships—she has no witnesses.” Complainant, with
a shriek ; “ Aint I, though ? Look at this. He’s
a black man.” And she held up a black-and-tan
infant for the inspection of the court, and to lend
color to her story. Case postponed—possibly to
give the baby time to bleach.
Dear Bulletin, —lie the Dean poisoning.
About ’B7, Surgeon-major Cross was tried, con-
victed and executed at Cork, Ireland, for poison-
ing his wife ; object—to marry the governess. It
was proved that Cross for weeks had given his
wife small doses of arsenic, to which, as it did
not work speedily enough, he at length added
strychnine with fatal results. The analysis was
conducted by C. Yelverton Pearson, M.D., now
Prof, at Dublin University; Prof. Rawdon
Macnamara, M.D., watched on behalf of the
defence. The monstrous theory of the counter-
acting effects of the strychnine was not even
hinted at. This case should be known to the
Australian faculty. Cross drew suspicion on him-
self by burying his victim at 6 a.m. and issuing a
certificate of death due to typhoid. Your remarks
that two analysts are necessary in a case of life
and death are strictly to the point.— Atragene.
A Bulletin correspondent :—So Geo.
Clarke, who with Mosman and Frazer dis-
covered the “Towers,” is gone, clubbed to
death by a New Guinea nigger while prospecting.
His end was, in a way, worthy of his life. A wild,
adventurous life, and a wild, adventurous death.
Well known in the North was Clarke, and widely
and deservedly popular. The Russell River gold-
field was opened up by this intrepid pioneer, and
had he lived there is little doubt that he would
have laid bare much of the auriferous wealth of
New Guinea. No man knew the Australian
blacks better than Clarke—much of his success as
an explorer being due to this circumstance, but he
appears to have been hardly circumspect enough
with the more formidable savages of Papua. His
discoveries enriched others, but never himself.
Like Nash, of Gympie, he did not possess the
true grab-faculty—your daring, ad venturous spirit
seldom does. He received no honors—no decora-
tions—no tinsel baubles; he died as he lived, a
simple, sturdy Man —grit to the backbone.

H. M‘LACHLAN,
Secretary.
The Sydney cash cyclist was in all his glory on
Zimmei man arriving, and abstracted from his guinea
subscription-fee about 7s. Od. in drink. Zim., hardly
sipping ins champagne and looking careworn and ill, was
nevertheless drowned in the soda of the cash cyclists’
speeches.
Altogether, the chances this trip are against
Zim. reaching form, hut his methods of training will
doubtless bring him to the post as well as seven out of
ten Australian riders.
• • * •
Zimmerman says that the cash-system purifies
amateurism. “ Riders never race so well and so straight
as when the money is at the last lap’s end.”
Off the track Zimmerman is a well-dressed,
unassuming, affable Yank—readier to listen than to talk,
and willing to talk about anything except himself. On
the track lie looks a game-eyed fibrous athlete, and his fibre
se ms to be of better texture than that of any known
Australian cyclist.
Walford, Zim.’s manager, denies that he
asked Parsons to forsake the Humber for the Nim-
rod. It was inopportune for Zim., Parsons defeating
him on a Humber. The Humber, it is claimed, can point
to more Australian successes than all other machines put
together.
* * • *
“ Wally ” Kerr, the crack New South Wales
amateur cyclist, the fastest of all Australian cyclists
behind a tandem, is training steadily to lower all Austra-
lian cycling records from quarter-mile up to 10 miles ; then
lie goes for the 41. L. championships.
* • • •
Parsons has defeated other champions by the
same tactics as those successfully employed by him
against Zimmerman, viz., forcing the pace from the start.
In the tO-mile Championship he smothered his field before
half the race was over, and did the same thing in Adelaide
a few weeks ago when he won by over two furlongs in five
miles.
• • • •
Zimmerman never rode upon a grass-track until
in Australia. The S.idney cricket-ground grass track is,
lie says, good, but thereon the exhibition sprint is im-
possible.
• * • •
The machine of Matthews, Melb. cyclist, must
have stood upon its hind-wheel and laughed at the
240yds. start allotted by Osborne, the Sydney League
handicapper, to Matthews in the two miles. Sccft,

If Matthews doesn’t go for this, he will either make or

How Anglophile is the cable-service may be
judged from the fact that the defeat of the English ath-
letes at New York was ascribed by it to the hot w eather ;
whereas the mail-news shows that the leading Englishmen
admitted they were fairly beaten.

Stern and stately Zimmerman is seldom ob-

in since landing occurred at Adelaide, when he turned up
to see the local talent play the ’Murkan game of baseball.

Zim. says that a cyclist is never so brilliant as
at 21, when he sprints on the wines of enthusiasm. After
that he rides with his head, hands, and legs, gauges his
opponent, and challenges him at the inferred proper
moment.
Zim. riding sits well forward, over his work.
All the Australian riders note it and shift their saddles
forward. When Zim. heat England, the riders did as the
Australians are now doing.
Racing, if Zim. collapses, he falls as a whole.
His ai ms, his legs, his wind are gone—he is spread-eagled
entirely.
It will have been noticed that Perkins, the
M.C.C., and Alcoek, the Surrey C.C., secretaries, in
selecting the best English team, choose respectively but
three and four of St odd irt's late eleven. Perkins’s eleven
includes Stod lart, Richardson and Peel, Alcock’s these
three and A. Ward.

Yourself and friend were

Anyway, you deserved to he had. It is
years since the genuine J. J. Miller ran
sweeps. About a year ago he attempted to re-
vive his ancient glories, hut the Melb. police
swooped down upon him and seized ttie cash in hand.
There re bogus Millers and bogus Adamses all over the
place. You seem to have struck a very palpable fraud.

Mr. H. J. Samuell, the well-known music
publisher, has just issued a guide to Sydney which
will be found very useful by visitors. It contains,
in a small space, much valuable information about
everything in the city and its vicinity which a
stranger wotdd desire to see and how to get there,
and it is illustrated with pictures of the various
beauty spots in and around the N.S. W. capital.
As a means whereby the visitor may avoid getting
lost in a badly tangled city this little volume can
be highly recommended.*

“THE OPENING OF A TRIUMPHAL
SUCCESS.”
“CAUGHT ON FROM THE JUMP.”
“NO HALL IN SYDNEY TO COMPARE
WITH IT.”
“ AN ORCHESTRA RIGHT UP TO DATE.”
‘ THE BALLET MOST CHARMING.”
■THE CHORUSES GIVEN WITH GREAT
SPIRIT AND DASH.”
(Twenty Choristers).
SUCH WERE THE OBSERVATIONS
OF THE DELIGHTED HUNDREDS
AS THE Y PASSED OUT ON SATUR-
DAY NIGHT.
Bead short Extracts from lengthy Press Notices of
Sunday Papers , and Monday's Commercial
Papers, the Herald and Daily Telegraph
Vide HERALD :—“ The hall is spacious, well
lighted and ventilated, and perfectly equipped
with the adjuncts of a Music-hall; and, granted
that the entertainments given in it are always up
to the standard of the initial one, it should have a
long run of popularity. A conspicuous feature of
the entertainment was the excellence of the
Orchestration, consisting of ten instruments.”
Vide DAILY TELEGRAPH Mr. Lawler
opened the Hall under most favourable auspices as
regards the entertainment and the attendance.
The almost inevitable defects of an initial perfor-
mance appeared to be absent. The rain even did
not interfere with the attendance, for the notice,
‘Full House,’ was up just as the programme
started. The rise of the curtain disclosed a pretty
set backed by a landscape. Mr. W. A. Ball was
interlocutor, Mr. Horace Bent and Mr. Jack
Williams were the bones, and Mr. Sam Rowley
and Mr. Gus Franks the tambos. A highly suc-
cessful start has been made by Mr. Lawler at his
new hall. Situated as it is in the heart of the
popular part of the city it is certain to become a
favourite resort with the large and growing num-
bers of playgoers who prefer the lighter forms of
amusement which the well-conducted music-hall
affords.”
Vide SUNDAY TIMES “ The opening show
was highly creditable to all concerned. The
building is well adapted for shows of the kind,
and if last night’s experience is a criterion the
Sydney Music-hall has entered on a lengthy cat eer
of prosperity.”
Vide TRUTH “ Happily situated in George-
street, and within speaking distance of the Town-
hall, artistically furnished, carefully built under
the s pervision of an architect who thoroughly
understands acoustics, the pretty hall should prove
a great favourite with the naturally pleasure-
loving people of New South Wale?. Immediately
the curtain rose last night, and disclosed an artis-
tically grouped company, fringed with the ever-
popular black fringe of tambos and tones, a feeling
of satisfaction went through everyone present.
The venture was going with a bang. One could
see it, and the band soon drove that feeling home
with telling effect.”
Vide BULLETIN ■“ If the new enterprise
keeps on as it has begun it ought to fill a long-
felt want, or something to that effect.”

And Liver Complaint
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. T. J. CLUNE,
of Walkerville, S. Australia, writes:
“Six years ago, 1 had an attack of Indiges-
tion and Liver Complaint that lasted for
weeks; I was unable to do any hard work,
had no appetite, food distressed me, and I
suffered much from headache. My skin was
sallow and sleep did not refresh me. I tried
several remedies and consulted a doctor,
without obtaining any relief; finally, one of
my customers recommended Ayer’s Sarsapa-
rilla; it helped me from the first,—in fact,
after taking six bottles I was completely
cured, and could eat anything and sleep like
a child.”

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“ It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to toll you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘Benger s Food.’ The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never be able to
rear her. We took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended 4 Benger s
Food.’ From that time she
began.,to pick up flesh and
strength:”
“If every mother knew of
fts value no other would be
used.”
Warrnambool (Vic.) Murray, M.L.A., in
reference to the salaries of taxidermists at Melb.
Museum :—“ As those useless scientists with the
extraordinary names must now have stuffed all
the beasts, birds, and fish in Australia, they
should be set to work to stuff each other, and then
jjhe expenditure would immediately cease.”
An English soldier who had lost his nose
has obtained a new one by having one of his
fingers grafted into the flesh where the bridge of
the nose should be. After it had been kept there
a month by a plaster of Paris bandage, the finger
was amputated and trimmed into shape, and a
flap of skin from the forehead brought down over
it. Now he has a very passable-looking nose with
a good bony bridge, a thing few manufactured
noses can boast.
A Chow converted to Christianity by a
R.C. mission learns that “Protestantism is an
immoral practice, which blasphemes God, degrades
man, and endangers society.” The leper bagged
by the direct opposition party is notified that “ the
church has no foe comparable to the Jesuit,”
whilst the various chapel missionaries are unani-
mous in nothing but their scorn for the older
Kerristian faiths. Converts as a rule grab one
another by the pigtail and scream “Heletic!”
“No Plopery ! ” or “God blessum Johnny
Wesley !” as the case may be. A Chow Baptist
has even been known to pray for the conversion of
the misguided missionary who lured his mother
into the Anglican church, and it is dimly sus-
pected that the Ku Cheng “Vegetarians” got
their message of salvation from a Plymouth
blother of the most extreme type.
They were at crib one night in Coolgardie
—a time when the jackeroo holds forth on all sub-
jects under the sun, especially concerning what
his people would think if they could only see him
as he was. The conversation suddenly and with-
out provocation turned from nothing in particular
to whether Mayor Shaw thoroughly grasped the
position of affairs of which he was the supposed
head, when a venturesome spirit suggested that
“ he ought to, as he had been Mayor of Adelaide.
“Nothing of the kind,” blurted jackeroo know-
all; “I saw in the paper that he was only ex-
Mayor of Adelaide.”
Dear Bulletin, — I met an Englishman in
Tasmania the other day, a younger member of a
“ good ” family, whom I would not mind backing
for a “bit” to give your “Dipsomaniac” two
stone and a beating. I travelled in the train with
him from Hobart to Launceston. He left Hobart
possessed of a flask of brandy, and flung the
empty flask out of the window ere reaching the
half-way house at Parattah, where he had a
bottle of wine for “eleven-o’clock lunch.” Be-
tween Parattah and Launceston he polished off
a flask of whisky neat, washing down dinner
at Launceston with another bottle of wine.
During the afternoon he strolled round and
sampled a few nips of ’Bl “old rye,” which
a local spirit-merchant had been boasting about
on the train - ride. Another bottle of wine
with his evening meal, and, sober as a judge in
legs and brain, he strolled down town to buy a
paper. As luck would have it, a child in the shop
was playing wdth a toy crocodile, which had just
been wound up and was crawling along the floor.
With a yell that could have been heard the other
side of the island our hero fled to his hotel, where
it took a couple of men to hold him down until he
slumbered, some hours later. Next morning he

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 18711 was eight days m the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try your Remedies. On Thursday before Good Friday I took the first
of your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Liver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline Eucalyptus Oil,
and I am now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHN KEAY.

The Committee of Management desire to draw the particular attention of all intending Subscribers
to the excellence of the properties, which have been most carefully selected by the Directors of the
Colonial Finance Corporation in Sydney, and disposed of to the Building Society, by a Conditional
Sale, at Less than Cost Price.
It will be observed that nearly.all the principal properties are of a Commercial nature, and Rent-
producing, and though the rentals have been greatly reduced to meet the existing depression, there is
little room for doubt that at an early date considerably increased rentals will be received.
Even at present rentals a handsome yearly income will accrue to the fortunate drawer of any of
the larger rent-producing properties, should he elect to retain same in preference to disposing of it.
It is now being generally recognised throughout the Colonies that the City of Sydney is destined
to become the Commercial Emporium of Australasia, and the fact of the above properties being nearly
all situated in or about Sydney renders the present Distribution more substantially attractive than
any previously offered to the public.
Detailed particulars of properties have been carefully prepared, and can be seen at the offices of
the Society, or at the Sydney Agency, by any intending Shareholder.

The Equitable Building Society, Brisbane, Queensland,

“Someone says thorn should be no work the day
after a holiday,’’ c- : I Mr. Byrne.
“I think a*l i i .try teachers should get an
extra week to mak : up for the lonely, homesick
days after the holidays are over,” said Miss
Murray. “ Isn’t it an awful feeling ? Ah, well,
we’ve had good weather and a very good time.
Monday will come soon enough without thinking
of it. I’ll have to leave on Saturday—there’s no
train on Sunday. I wouldn’t mind going back so
much if one could start working right away. It’s
the dismal Sunday I dread. I’ll start moping and
be miserable all the week—and I wanted to stay
in Sydney so much. Isn’t it a shame ? ”
“ Well, wait and go up by Monday night’s
train,” said Mr. Byrne.
“ But suppose the inspector should go there ? ”
“Not he ! You’ve got to chance meeting him ;
but they’re not supposed to examine for a month
after the holidays. It’s safe enough. Tell the
people you got a day off; mark the youngsters
present; and who’s to know ? Pooh I I’ve done it
often.”
“Do you really think it’s safe?” asked Miss
Murray.
“Of course,” answered Mr. Byrne; “it’s a
hundred to one chance against being caught.”
Miss Murray arrived at her school on Tuesday
morning, and, being very young in deceit, at once
marked the roll for the previous day. During the
morning her inspector drove up. “ All who were
present yesterday when the roll was called,
stand ! ” said he, as he opened the register.
Not a movement.
“Scholars, dismiss, and go home. Kindly
gather any personal effects you may have here,
Miss Murray. I might mention that I waited
here two hours yesterday. Thanks. Good morn-
ing.
It was the hundredth chance !
PONTE.
According to Gov. M‘Gregor, of New
Guinea, the mission-station at Dobu is teaching a
most valuable lesson. The missionary-students
are trained to do, at the same time, their preach-
ing and their share of manual labor, their gardens
being actually the best and most productive in the
village. If somebody would only educate the
Australian clergy up to the same lofty ideal !

The last war-correspondent to visit Tas.
has been telling the Maorilanders what a beauti-
ful spot the little island will make as an out-
station for the savage invader. But he didn’t
tell the Tasmen so. The military force of
Tasmania, is chiefly composed of officials and
a battery which is as innocent as it looks.

Island-r-our northern battery,” said the hon. Tom.
“Ah ! really,” said the D.V., scanning the bare
shores of Pig through his field-glasses, “ but I
don’t see the guns.” “Not such blanky fools,”
said Tom, “ we hide ’em in the bulrushes.”
The demand for “ Crom-a-boo ” has neces-
sitated a fourth edition, which is now in the press.*
Professional thieves gather some of their
most valuable information from the daily press,
per favor of the police. Under the heading of
“ Recent Robberies ” they find paragraphs such
as this : —“ On Sunday evening the house of Mrs.
—-, widow, street, Jamberoo, was visited
by thieves, who forced the back window in and
stole clothing to the value of £5 10s. Mrs,
had in the house at the time a valuable parcel of
jewellery , which the thieves missed,” The policeman
who gives such information, and the journalist
responsible for its appearance in print, deserve 14
days apiece for “inciting to crime.” Practically
the Artful Dodger who got away with the widow’s
raiment is advised to revisit the scene of his
depredation and look for the jewellery.

Visitor (in a Murray district): “Nowi
butcher, when you are dressing a diseased beast
for sale, what do you do with the cancerous part B
you cut out?” Guileless slaughterman: “Feed
’em to the pigs : it don’t hurt ’em ! What else
would you do with ’em ? ”

HER MAJESTY
AND
HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE
ncc of
After the Accident.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ONB man sat upon a heap of broken reef near the
face, with his broad palms supporting his chin.
His thin, hollow cheeks showed between the out-
spread fingers, a sickly yellow in the candle light.
One candle in a spiked holder burned against the
side of the drive. Two billies and ttvo full crib-bags
hung near on dog-hooks driven in an upright leg,
and at the man’s feet lay a couple of picks
and a shovel. Kyley sat with his back to the
face, staring with glowing, vindictive eyes into
the gathered gloom down the drive, where the
passage to the shaft was choked to the roof with
splintered timber and fallen mullock, and where
the head of a second man was dimly visible. Only
the head and shoulders of this otner were free; the
rest of his body was hidden under the debris.
The second man was thrown face downwards;
across his back, pinning his arms, lay the great
cap-piece, which alone seemed heavy enough to
have crushed the life out ol him. Beyond this
the tumbled reef and splintered slabs were piled
to the roof.
But the buried miner was not dead. The tough
red-gum log forced down by the mighty pressure
had ploughed its way diagonally down the side of
the drive, and pinched him to the floor, stopping
when the pressure of another inch must have been
followed by certain and speedy death. A stout
iron truck was jammed under the log beside him,
torn and doubled like a card-board box. The
young man could lift his chin a few inches from
the floor of the drive, and turn his face from one
side to the other, but was incapable of any other
movement.
Presently he spoke. His voice came with an
effort, and sounded feebly shrill, like that of a
very old man.
“Dick, Dick ! in the name o’ God, speak man !
D’ye think there’s a chance for us ? ”
Dick Kyley dropped his hands, and there was
an expression of grim satisfaction in his gaunt
face as he replied deliberately, “There’s a chance
fer me, William,”
The buried man lifted his clay-smirched face,
startled by the other’s tone, and gazed eagerly at
his mate, and continued gazing for fully a minute,
puzzled and frightened by the incongruous levity
in the face that confronted him. Then, the posi-
tion becoming painful, he dropped his cheek in
the wet clay again.
“What d’ye mean?” he asked anxiously. “ Why
only fer you ?”
“ Because, William, I don’t think you’ve gob a
dog’s show.”
The reply was without a trace of sympathy ;
there was, in fact, a touch of malicious banter in
the mincing tone of the “William.” William
Hether had never been anything but “ Hether,”
or “ Bill ” to his shift mate before.
Again Hether looked anxiously into Kyley’s
face. Its cadaverous hollows were filled with
dark shadows, and the high-lights brought out the
salient features in a grotesque caricature that
struck Hether as simply fiendish. He turned
from the sight, with a new horror in his heart.
“This ain’t no time to fool a man, Dicx,” he
said humbly. “ How can there be any chance fer
you if I ain’t in it ?”
Kyley arose, plucked tne candle from tbe wall,
and advancing close to his mate held the flame
low down, and showed him a small pool of water
fathered upon the floor within 18 Inches of hU
ace.
“ That’s why,” he said.
Hether understood, and a ory broke from his
lips.
“ Keep it back, Dick 1” he gasped.
“William,” said Kyley, calmly replacing the
candle and resuming ids former position on the
reef, “you’re a fool. That water’s coming in
from the face, as usual. The fall has dammed the
gutters, and it can’t get away; consequently, in
less’n five hours the pool will be above your ears.
And you know what that means.”
“ But you can build a dam around me. Get the
shovel—quiok 1 Make a dam with that loose
reef, an’ the clay off the floor. Dick, Dick 1 give
us a chance, for God’s sake, man 1 ”
Hether stopped short, staring at the ether who
sat calmly regarding him. Presently he spoke
again in a quavering whisper :
“ You won’t see a man drown without lendin’ a
hand t’ help him? ”
“No, I won’t see it,” replied Kyley, “because
I’m goin’ to douse this light. A candle burns up
the air, an’ I’ll want all there is here, I reckon,
before the boys reach me.”
Driven almost wild with terror, a terror
occasioned no less by the grim significance of
Kyley’s leering countenance and the brutality of
the words than by the horrors of his position,
Hether began to plead piteously, with tears and
meanings. The pain of broken bones and the
sickness of exhaustion had quite unmanned “ Big
Bill Hether,” but his agony did not touch the
heart of Kyley, who seemed to have forgotten that
death also threatened him in the delight that the
young man’s sufferings awakened within his
breast.
“ Why’ve yeh rounded on me, Dick ? What’ve
I done—what’ve I ever.done? ” moaned the help-
less man.
“ I’m not goin’ to lift a finger to keep you out
of hell,” answered the other, “because of her,
William —because of Hannah.”
Bill turned his face to the light again, and once
more he stared at Kyley, sharply, inquiringly,
reading every line of his fateful countenance.
Then a groan of despair broke from him.
“ I’ll go away, Kyley,” he said —“true’s Christ,
if we get out I’ll go away, an’ you’ll never hear of
me again. Only make a dam. Quick, man,
quick, it’s coinin’! God I this is worse than
murder. Dick ”
The water having filled the depression at the
side of the drive was now running down and
forming a pool in the hollow under Hether’s chin.
Kyley turned and blew out the caudle. For a
long time Hether continued to supplicate in the
darkness, and Kyley, leaning comfortably against
the face, heard the thin voice, weakening to an
almost inarticulate whisper, beseeching by all
that is good on earth and holy in heaven for a
little grace—another poor chance of life, and
answered never a word. By a painful effort the
young man continued to keep his mouth above the
gathering water, but gradually the torture that
afflicted his extended neck became unendurable,
and now in his last extremity he railed at Kyley
as a murderer, and abused him with curses in
weak, childish tones that were nevertheless preg-
nant with passion, and sounded distinctly, and
with terrifying emphasis, in that black chamber
of death.
Suddenly there was silence. Dick Kyley
listened, and presently heard a bubbling sound in
the water. That ceased, and all was still. He
felt now that his vengeance was complete—that
Hether was dead, and at that moment the fierce
emotions of resentment and revenge-hunger that
had possessed and uphold him departed in a
breath, and left him weak and cowed. His limbs
trembled, and beads of perspiration gathered
about the roots of his hair and rolled coldly upon
his brow and cheeks. He was thinking, too, of
his own wretched case. He heard, fitfully, a
distant drumming, the sound of timber being
driven home, and knew that the rescue-parties
were working as hard as men may work; but
whether theirs would be a job of hours or days he
could not tell, and already he fancied he detected
some taint of vitiation in the air.
Dick Kyley, sitting alone in the blackness
of his prison, waiting for salvation death,
was soon the victim of an ungovernable fear,
a supernatural terror entirely new to him, and
the more awful for its novelty. From the
moment he believed Hether dead he began to fear
him. He strove with all the energy of his strong
sense to drive him from his thoughts, but do what
he might his mind would revert to the dread sub-
ject, and his eyes turn, staring intently into the
darkness where at times they seemed to detect a
yet blacker form in the pitch-black night that
filled the drive—the shape of the dead man’s head.
The horror grew, and with it an agonising convic-
tion that Hether’s dead face was staring at him
with dead but seeing eyes. Imagination had
pictured the pallid cheeks stained with blood and
clay, and the wide, accusing eyes, till the vision
became a reality to him. Tortured beyond endur-
ance, Kyley fumbled in his pocket, and found a
match, which he struck upon the shovel blade. As
the light filled the chamber a groan of relief
broke from the miner’s laboring breast. Only the
back of Hether’s head was visible ; his face was
sunk to the temple in the water. Dick extin-
guished the match —his last—and sat down again,
only to struggle with another relay of horrors that
presently arose against him.
William Hether still lived. He had discovered
that by taking a deep breath and sinking his face
till tile forehead rested upon the clay he was en-
abled to allay the pain in his neck and to con-
tinue the struggle. He persisted in this course,
noiselessly, for the sound of the rescuers at work
had filled him with a glorious hope, and with that
hope had come a fear that Kyley might be moved
to murder him if he thought his rescue possible.
So another hour fled. The water in the drive,
which had now found a broad level, continued to
rise slowly. Kyley had lost the power of appre-
ciating time, and sat huddled against the wall,
distraught with fear and despair. Hether’s face
was haunting him again, standing forth visibly,
threatening and awful in the tomb-like darkness.
His mad fancy stretched every hour of his im-
prisonment into a long day, and he believed that
it was his fate to be stifled by the foul gases from
his mate’s decomposing corpse. Even now the
taint was in his nostrils. Although he was listening
all the time with agonised intensity, he no longer
heard the hammering of the miners beyond; his
mind was too full of its unspeakable fear—he
awaited the attack of the inhuman thing that his
irresponsible faculties had fashioned out of the
impenetrable gloom at the end of his narrow
prison.
At this crisis, Hether called again in a piercing
voice full of the supreme terror
“ Help ! help ! Kyley, you murderer ! fiend !
devil ”
At the first sound of the voice, Kyley sprang
back against the end of the drive, and shrieked,
with all the power of his lungs, again and again;
and there he remained, crouched down, pressing
his face into the gravel, clutching his ears, shiver-
ing and moaning.
Three hours later the rescuers broke through,
and found Hether under the fall, with his head in
a pool of water, dead, and Kyley squatting at the
face, babbling of spectres and devils.
It is still Mr. Richard Kyley’s quaint belief
that ho is a conspicuous figure in hell.

Assembly, the other night, re payment for over-
time to temporary and permanent railway hands
during the wool season. lam a temporary hand,
employed with others at Newcastle. When I
sought employment, I asked for two or three
months’ constant work during the season. I was
promised nothing, but, with the first wool, was
put on with others, being at once told, “You
will only be paid 6s. a day ” (nine hours). This
is how it pans out. On starting, I have to sign a
book ; but I mustn’t sign it till the foreman tells
me. I start work at 6 a.m., and work right on,
allowing for meals, if necessary, till 5, 6 or 8 p.m.,
or, as happened once, 8.30 p.m. (when I made
three hours and a half overtime), and come at six
next morning. For the same class of work, private
firms are paying Is. an hour, and Is. 6d. an hour
overtime. Then, by-and-by, 1 ask if we are paid
for overtime, and am told ‘‘No; you must take
it out.” “ And supposing I don’t happen to
have sufficient time in ? ” “ Then you are pro-
portionately short in your pay.” Next, I am
told to come at nine, but find there is nothing
doing, but—l “can look in again at two, and see
if anything turns up.” Nothing turns up; but I
“had better hang round,” and so on. _ As
a matter of fact, for the coming fortnight’s
pay I have, so far, but four days in out
of a possible nine—during all of which time I have
been hanging round. Then I have to wait another
week to get my money. Of course, that means
on the average a very small wage. To be con-
stantly on the job it is preferable to live in town,
but in town rents are high, so I ask for the usual
employes’ privilege—a season ticket at half-rates,
so that I may live in the cheaper suburb, but am
refused because I am only a temporary hand—not
casual, mind you. Had I the luck to be a casual,
I would consider myself equal to the rest of the
wool-jammers, and worth Is. an hour. Certainly
if they picked competent men in a casual way
they would have to pay the current rate of Is. an
hour. An instance ; We are told on Saturday,
“Look round on Monday.” We are there at
6 o’clock. After some hesitation we are started
and work the usual hours till about 4 o’clock.
At 4.25 we are sacked and permanent hands finish
the work. That gives us about ss. 4d. for the
day’s work, and for that day at least we are
debarred from picking up anything else. Our Bd.
an hour only amounts to the Government estab-
lished minimum wage when we are employed for
the full nine hours. Now, is this sweating ?
or is it “commercial principles”?—F., Newcas-
tle, 21/10/’95,

“A Traveller of Finance."
A BANKING INTERVIEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
He pushed open the door and walked in with the
confidence of a bailiff about to take possession.
“Is the princi -pawl within?” he enquired, with
the air of a newly-created peer, addressing the
teller standing behind the counter of a bank that
had not reconstructed, and whose pride in conse-
quence about equalled that of the speaker’s
manner.
“Do you mean the manager ?” came the query
from the officer, experienced in all sorts and con-
ditions of callers.
“I wish to see the prinox-pawl of this establish-
ment 1”
“Do you particularly want to see him?” en-
quired the officer, suspiciously.
“I should not have called otherwise,” came the
reply in tones so sharp, and withal so sug-
gestive of capital in the background, that the
usually quick-discerning official was completely
disarmed, and banishing all doubt of the hona-Jidcs
of his visitor, he politely requested him to “step
around and go in at the door on the left.” Follow-
ing this precise direction the stranger marched
round the counter and knocked peremptorily at
the door upon which was a brass-plate with the
word “ Manager ” largely engraved thereon, so
that all who approached might read. Barely
waiting for the “Come in ” the visitor turned the
handle and entered, carefully closing the door
behind him.
“ You are the principal#?, I presume ? ” he said,
addressing a man busily engaged writing.
“lam the manager. Do you wish to speak
with me ? ”
“ I have called to see if you require a traveller
of finance ? ” spoken calmly.
“A what?” gasped the manager,
“ A. traveller of finance. A gentleman to repre-
sent your—firm —your great and wealthy corpora-
tion 1"
“ Ah, I see,” replied the manager, who had
recovered his presence of mind. “I am afraid,
however, yon have made a mistake in calling here,
You see,” with befitting dignity, “we don’t
require to do business on those lines. You will
sxcuse me just now. I am very busy," and the
aianager dipped his pen in the ink, instead of the
less considerate method of bluntly asking his
visitor to retire.
Then the latter burst into tears, wringing his
hands piteously, “ I have a sick child at home—
I should say a wife who is in bed with paralysis—
oh, for the love of God, give me help ! ” and the
man looked through his tears at the calm and
unemotional face of the bank representative. As
the lattet gave no sign of being touched, but only
began to write, the man stopped his tears, and,
blushing an indignant red, he exclaimed; “You
doubt my statement, sir ? ”
“I said nothing,” replied the manager, tlintily.
“But you looked it j you are a hard lot —you
men of bad overdrafts. Your vaults are bursting
with the savings of the poor—and men like me
have to walk the streets ” .
“I can’t have that soit of talk here. Come, you
must go out-” and the bank man rose up from his
Beat in just wrath, and spoke in threatening tones.
“ Will you give me threepence ? Your bank can
stand that, I suppose ? ”
“ My bank doesn’t stand impudence and loafers.
Come, go.” And the manager made as if to assist
the exit of his visitor.
“ You mean that ? ” said the man, speaking and
looking as if he thought he might forgive the
miserable bank official.
“Come, now, I want to get to work,” spoke the
latter again, angrily.
The tears were pumped up again.
“ Have you no feeling for my sick child ?”
“You spoke of your paralysed wife just now,"
corrected the official, cruelly.
“My mother is dead. Speak not of her,” said
the man, theatrically. “She never begot such a
son as you. I bid you good day, sir," The
speaker waved his hand magnanimously. “ Your
bank withstood the shock of ’93. The more shame
that you turn me away. I scorn your paupers’
gold. Good day, director!”
He had opened the door and was standing with
half his body through. He looked long and
silently, and with compassionate reproach in his
eye, which was directed to the bank-man’s bald
head bent low over the blotting-pad. The will-
force must have been weak, probably spent by the
nervous energy of the preceding dialogue, for the
manager did not raise his head. The man stood
in undecided attitude. He made a move to go,
then halted and looked again at the bald crown of
the “official head.”
“ Charity, thy name is— woman,” came the
words in Hamlet tones. Again the tears flowed,
and amid a snivelling the departing customer
cried out : “ What does our precious master say?
He says : ‘Bless they who curse ye 1’ ” With a
bang the door was closed, and the manager was
alone once more in his room. Passing out of the
bank-chamber the stranger looked across to the
young man behind the counter.
“ Banks are close corporations,” he said.
“ Adieu, young friend. Be kind to your
mother ! ”

PELICAN.
Dear Bulletin, —The platypus has been
caught at Nebo, 68 miles S.VV. of Mackay, and
nearly three degrees north of Baffle Creek. —
Toby. Winton(Q.)
At Bundaberg (Q.) the police recently
examined Kanakas coming into town and relieved
them of sheath-knives, revolvers, cartridges and a
curious implement of native invention —viz., a
“grappler.” A “grappler ”is the iron portion of
a garden-rake fitted with straps to the hand—
points well-sharpened.
The wealthy Jews of London are be-
ginning to kick against the system which
“sweats” their charity funds fpr the enrichment
of the Moses who deals in “ slops.” Twenty
thousand hungry co-religionists (mostly Poles) are
employed in the clothing trade at an average
remuneration of 12s. a week, and the difference
between 12 “bob" andalivingwage has to bedrawn
from the charities, otherwise the 20,000 Chosen
would ascend to a region where shoddy garments
are unknown. The Jewish Chronicle reminds its
subscribers that this draining of their charities to
support sweated tailors takes the form of a sub-
vention of wages, or an annual bonus to the slop-
trade. Hence a proposal to organise the East End
Jews on communal lines, start co-operative
factories with a large lump sum of money down,
and bring Moses and his middlemen to confusion.
A Black Heathen .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Topknot was a nigger with a bad reputation. He
was a good enough station-boy when it so pleased
him, but when it did not please him there was
, , .
only one way of arguing the point with him, and
that was by means of a slip-rail. There was,
however, one man in the district who could
manage Topknot by moral suasion, and that man
was Ogilvie, of Bokkimarra, and he kept his
~ “ , J _ ,
method a secret. Whatever the influence he
exerted was, it was a potent one, and Topknot, a
powerful aborigine of more than Ogilvie’s stature
and physique, never disobeyed him, even when
mad-drunk. For all that the power was not one of
• . , i ,
affection, and it was rumoured that, night or day,
Ogilvie was never without his revolver, nor was
he Bver known to let Topknot ride or walk behind
bi m .
T , „,. , . . . ,
It was the standing mystery of the district, and
was solved in an extraordinary way. One day
lopknot came home with a bullet-wound, at least
~ f , ■, . . , ~,
it looked suspiciously like one, although he ex-
plained that he had staked himself, and as it was
just inside his thigh, it might possibly have hap-
pened that way. Ogilvie had been out on a
different, part of the run; when he returned he
dressed the wound and Topknot was laid up in
camp for some time. But young Halkett, who
was gaining colonial experience, said that on going
suddenly into the room he came unawares upon
Ogilvie extracting two empty cartridge-cases from
his pistol and putting two fresh cartridges in.
Topknot was soon about. A flesh-wound
quickly heals on a blackfellow, and he seemed
more under Ogilvies influence than ever. Soon
after that a horse fell on Ogilvie, and so bruised
his leg that he had to lie up. It was a dry time
and the fires were about. Halkett and all hands
went out to burn round a paddock, leaving the
old cook to look in and see after Ogilvie now and
again. The kitchen and men’s hut were no
distance from the cottage where Ogilvie and
Halkett lived, but the old man was deaf and
heard nothing, until, thinking it was about time
to see how the boss was getting along, he went in.
Guessing he might be asleep he slipped off his
shoes and crept in noiselessly, meaningjnsttopeep
into the room, but what he saw there gave him a
t urn -
Topknot was standing by Ogilvio’s bed. The
latter’s revolver lay on the ground and he himself
appeared to have something tied over his mouth
and round his arms. Topknot had a butcher’s
knife in his hand, and appeared about to carve
Ogilvie whose shirt was torn open at the breast,
Dan, the cook, was a tough and plucky old man.
He knew he had no chance against Topknot and
he could see the case was one for instant action—
there was no time to go back to the kitchen for a
gun. Drawing his sheath-knife, which was old,
sharp and worn to a point as a cook’s knife should
be, he sprang forward and stabbed the naked
black fair in the spine. Topknot dropped. The
cook cut the bandages round Ogilvie s arms and
Ogilvie motioned eagerly for his pistol, which Dan
picked up and gave to him.
Ogilvie emptied the last of the five chambers into
“That makes the third time he has attempted
my life,” said Ogilvie when explaining matters
“You see this scar on my breast’’—exposing a
cicatrice like an elongated V. 1 “It was made
lonig ago by a burn I got when trying to save a
woolshed on fire. One day in the wet season wo
were swimming some horses across the river. I
was stripped, of course, and I noticed Topknot
gtart and look stlange ly at me when ho saw it. I
suppose I stared back pretty hard, but over after
that ho would do anything I told him without a
murmur. I guessed what it was but could not
make full enquiries without giving myself away.
However, 1 found out by degrees that this scar

asked Halkett.

From Westralia comes news of the death
of John Garner, who, years ago, was condemned
to death in Lincolnshire for the murder by poison
Q t his wife and mother-in-law. The sentence was
commuted to transportation for life to Westralia.
Garner always asserted his innocence, alleging
that a servant, with whom he had improper rela-
tions, had committed the double murder. A
petition with 20,000 signatures was, after a lapse
of years, presented to Homo Secretary Matthews,
asking for a free pardon. This was granted, but
Garner declined to accept it, unless Government
compensated him for the business he had lost at
the time of his conviction. This Government
declined to do, and Garner elected to remain
and die in Western Australia,

The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers o
the day. It is only the remainder that is founc
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
arge fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
ami follow its_ lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after th
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the _ date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. I hey are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form-printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Oause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official—that
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than and
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the bright as t
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.
