Love Songs from the Greek.
AN OFFERING TO APHRODITE.
I laughed exultant over men.
All Hellas sighed for longing;
Young gallants sought for Lais then,
About her portal thronging.
v. But now I bring my glass to thee,
To look therein I care not;
For what I was I cannot see,
And what I am l dare not.
—Plato.
THE MESSAGE.
Dorcas, go and tell her this —-
Run, and mind you say it twice,
Lest a word she chance to miss:
Hurry! stop! repeat it thrice.
Fly, you sluggard, don't forget:
Dorcas! ivhy so quick away?
Fool, you haven't heard as yet
Half of what l want to say.
Dorcas, add to what I said—
No, again I’m blundering,
Leave that out, and say instead —•
Nothinn — no, say everything !
Don’t omit a single word;
I’m the fool to trust in you.
Wherefore hurry? it’s absurd —
Can’t you see I’m coming, too?
. ' - —Meleager.
A MOTTO.
Sporting with sweet Hermione
I noted that she wore
/ A broidered girdle, fair to see,
As ere the Papliian bore.
And round in golden letters ran —•
“Love me, and aye be true;
But grudge not. if another man
Should love as well as you!”
—Asclepiades.
A DRINKING SONG.
Crown high the cup and pass it roiind,
For subtle thought and rare
Or miracle of honeyed sound
Perchance is lurking there.
Full draughts of Chian let me taste,
If ye would stir my wit,
For life is but an arid waste
Except we moisten it.
, —-Hedylus.
THE BOOKS.
How many years their course have run,
All pages in my book of fate,
Full half of the account is done,
Xanthippe, I am thirty-eight!
Sep in my hair that glint of white,
The messengers of age are here,
Though still the flame of love is- bright
And song and merriment are dear.
The reckoning will I commit,
Dear Muse, to thee, my passion’s guide,
But let Xanthippe’s name be writ
As “Total” on the credit side.
-—Philodemus.
TO A FLOWER SELLER.
I saw you standing in the mart
And weaving pretty posies,
And though your beauty pierced my heart
I hid the wound with careful art,
And feigned to seek for roses.
A vain deceit, you read my thought
(A rosy blush betrayed it),
I gave the gods the wreath I bought j
And in return from them besought
The pretty one who made it.
—Strato.
From “Greek Love Songs and Epigrams,”
from the Anthology, first and second series,
translated by J. A. Pott (Ivegan Paul, each
volume Is. 9d.).
Plays
The surprising thing about G. Constant
Lounsbery’s dramatisation of Wilde’s well-
known romance, The Picture of Dorian Gray
(Simpkin, Marshall, per Dymock’s Library)
is that it has not been done before. This
rendering, dramatically effective enough, bor-
rows much of Wilde’s brilliancy of epigram,
and yet this continuous scintillation of wit
detracts from the drama. In Wilde’s come-
dies he kept his compositions upon one plane;
his epigrams had their place in the develop-
ment of his theme, and his theme was of a
sufficient lightness and even of sufficient arti-
ficiality to allow of its embellishment by this
elaborate verbal embroidery. Here we have
horror treated epigrammatically. Wilde, in
deciding not to dramatise his romance, must
have felt the incongruity of the conjunction.
The third series of Plays by August Strind-
berg (Duckworth) contains six dramas of
varying interest. Swanwlvite, a delicate
and delightful fairy play, was written under
the influence of Maeterlinck’s puppet plays.
In this fantasy Strindberg has succeeded in
extracting the quintessence of Swedish folk-
lore. The play has been highly successful
on the Swedish and the German stage; but
no enterprising English producer has dared
to try it on the prosaic Australian or Eng-
lish playgoer. Indeed, it seems too deli-
cate, too sentimental, too innocently childish,
to bring its dim atmosphere of fairy-land to
the footlights. How naive, for instance, is
a stave direction such as this
The Stepmother stops on the balcony, rigid
as a statue. She opens her mouth as if she
were pouring out venom. The peacock and
the doves fall down dead. Then the Step-
mother begins to swell. Her clothes become
inflated to such an extent that they hide her
head and bust entirely. They seem to be
flaming with a pattern of interwoven snakes
and branches. The ceiling sinks slowly into
the room , while smoke and fire burst from
the fireplace.
And after the ceiling has gone back to its
place, “the magic bubble around the Step-
mother hursts, and she appears once more
in her customary .shape.”
. Jt
Simoom, a terrible one-act play, echoes
Edgar Allan Poe. Its stage-craft is bril-
liant. In this tiny playlet the dramatist can
afford to waste no time. Thus he begins :
Biskra enters the Mohammedan shrine.
The hood of her burnous is pulled over her
head so that it almost covers her face. She
carries a guitar at her back. Throwing' her-
self down in a kneeling position on one o] the
rugs, she begins to pray with her arms
crossed over her breast.
Yusuf (enters quickly) : The Simoom is
coming ! Where is the Frank?
Biskra : He’ll be here in a moment.
Yusuf : Why didn’t you stab him when
you had a chance?
Biskra: Because he is to do it himself. If
I were to do it, our whole tribe would be
killed.
Yusuf: He is to do it himself, you say?
How is that to'happen?
Biskra : Don’t you know that the Simoom
makes the brains of the white people dry as
dates, so that they have horrible visions
which disgust them with life and cause them
to flee into the great”unknown?
J*
Debit and Credit is but weakly interesting,
and Advent, belonging to the dramatist’s
“Inferno period,” is cluttered up with Swe-
denborgian mysticism. Its chief character
is “The Other One,” a quaint Strindbergian
Mephistopheles ; and among the many other
subsidiary characters are The Seven Deadly
Sins. As usual in this'class of play, Strind-
berg makes extraordinary demands .on his
scene painter and his stage mechanician.
«5* .
When in 1907 a young theatrical manager
opened the Intimate Theatre .at Stockholm,
Strindberg was keenly interested. The
theatre, with its tiny stave and its seating
capacity of 175 persons, soon became a
Strindberg experimental dramatic farm;
and for it lie wrote a series of “chamber
plays.” Two of . these appear in this volume,
The Thunderstorm and After the Fire. The
chief innovations of this theatre were the
abolition of the interval and the reduction o£
stage settings to the smallest limit. The
Thunderstorm records, with infinite tender-
ness and sympathy, the successive renuncia-
tions of a man growing old. The Master
has his fine philosophy of old age.
“I never interfere, for I am anxious for
the peace of myxoid age... ..I am settling
my accounts, both'with life and with people,
and I have already begun to pack for the
journey. Of course, .he solitude has its
drawbacks, but when there is nobody who
can make any demands on you, then you
have won your freedom.. . .The best thing is
to remain oblivious of everything.”
He had married at 50, and when he grew
too old for his girl-wife he gave her her free-
dom, leaving her with their child. But now lie
is too old to worry about them. He doesn’t
want to know even what has become of
them. „,
“Having at last outlived the horrors of long-
ing, I came to regard the whole business as
buried ; and as none but beautiful memories
were left behind in our rooms, I remained
where I was....As time passes, all
memories grow beautiful... .When you
have passed a certain age, nothing
changes, nothing progresses—-all the move-
ment is downward... .And it is peaceful, the
way I have it here. No love, no friends, only
a little company to break up the solitude.
Then human beings are just human beings,
without any claims on your feelings and
sympathies. Then you come loose like an
old tooth, and drop out without pain or
regrets.”
But the peace of old age is abruptly
shattered by the return of his wife and
daughter; and, in a series of dramatic
scenes, it seems as if peace would. never
come again. But though he saves his wife
and daughter from disaster, he is firm in
his resolve not to take on new responsibili-
ties. And the thunderstorm passes, leaving
the old man free again.
In After the Fire, Strindberg appears as
“The Stranger,” and over the ruins of a
burnt house, the home of his childhood, he
finds all the lies and make-believe of that
apparently honest and respectable household
nakedly exposed. A highly dramatic piece
of bitter irony, evidently largely autobio-
graphical.
G. K. Qhesterton’s first play, Magic, a
fantastic comedy (Seeker), is amusing,
slight and unconvincing. Patricia meets
The Stranger in the woods, and, because
she is able to see fairies, and the stranger
wears a cloak with a pointed hood, she
takes hi.m to be an elf. She is living in a
Duke’s house, or whatever it is a duke lives
in when he’s at home; and when her
brother returns from America, he insists
that the stranger is no fairy and certainly
no gentleman. The stranger is inveigled
into the house, and uncloaked. He turns
out to be a conjurer engaged by the Duke
to give a performance that evening for las
guests. Patricia is pained. When the
stranger says he is very sorry that he is
not a wizard she accuses him of being a
thief.
“You have committed the cruellest crime,
I think, that there is stealing a child’s
toy.” “And what have I stolen?” he asks.
“A fairy tale.”
In the next act we see the conjurer
arranging his properties for his perform-
ance. He admits that he is a conjurer and
nothing blit a conjurer, but adds to himselt,
“Unless I could show I was something else,
and that would be worse.” Patricia’s brother,
a smart American, knows how all the con-
jurer’s tricks are done, but, as the con-
jurer points out in the quarrel' that arises,
he can’t even produce a bowl of goldfish
himself. But various unexplained things
happen, and suddenly the red lamp of the
doctor’s surgery over the road turns blue.
Patricia’s brother is nonplussed; and when
the conjurer is asked to turn the light red
again, and does so, the American, in a high
state of excitement, plunges out. into the
garden to investigate. When he is brought
back he is delirious. The doctor admits that
there is madness in the family. In the final
act the doctor insists on tlie _ conjurer ex-
plaining how he did the blue-light trick, as
it appears the American is in danger of
going insane in his present state unless a
satisfactory explanation is immediately
forthcoming. The conjurer at last admits
that he did it “by magic.”
“But, hang it all,” the doctor cries,
“there’s no such thing.”
“Yeg there is. I wish to God I did not.
know that there is.”
lie confesses that he had got mixed up
with spiritualism, and found that the
spirits with whom he had come in contact
were evil, “awfully, unnaturally evil.” He
cut the connection; but they were always
tempting him to use the supernatural power
he hkd got from them. And in his anger
he had called on the fiends, and they had
obeyed him. He goes out into the garden,
and the atmosphere of eeriuess is credibly
kept up by tilings suggested, not seen, tak-
ing place out there. When he returns it is
with the news that he had managed to
think of a natural explanation for that
trick. He takes that explanation —which
isn’t given to the audience —to the delirious
I man. For. as he says to the household:
“You cannot think how that trick could be
done naturally. I alone found out how it
could be done —after.l had done it by magic.
But if I tell you a natural way of doing it,
half an hour after I have left this house
you will be all saying how it was done.”
But one cannot help thinking that half a
minute after the curtain falls the audience
will all be saying how it was done. . Ches-
terton fails to make us believe in' his
miracle. It is either too simple a miracle —
one that is, as it happens, done every night
in the revue at Melbourne-—or Chesterton
has not the stage-craft to make it appear
miraculous. However, the conjurer gets his
girl, add the fairy tale comes to an end in
the' only way a fairy tale can come to an
end, the only way a fairy tale can leave
off being a fairy tale, by coming true.
J*
Lennox Robinson is a .name to mark in the
modern Irish drama. His Two Flays: Har-
vest, The Clancy Flame (Maunsel, Dublin),
are admirable examples of the real Irish
comedy. Lennox Robinson has not the genius
of Synge, nor the dreamy beauty of i'eats,
nor the cheerful humor of Lady Gregory;
but there is a quiet truth in his work, and a
solid sense of plot, construction. In Harvest
we meet the Hurley family of farmers. The
father believed in education for his children,
and the .village school-teacher takes a pardon-
able pride in the success of the Hurley chil-
dren. One has become a priest, another has
some vague position of trust in London, an-
-1,1 her is a chemist’s assistant in Dublin, and
he daughter, Mary, is understood to be keep-
ng herself by typing in London. But educa-
;ion costs money, and when the chemist,
lack, returns to the farm with his young
vife, he slowly learns that the farm has been
nortgaged. The father, in desperation,
>urns down some farm-buildings, in order to
;et compensation from the district. The ready
noney is necessary to save him from being
;urned out of the farm. But Jack threatens
to inform if his father makes his claim ; and
lonsiders himself in honor bound to resign his
Dublin billet and help on the farm. His wife,
in love with the country, eagerly assents. But
gradually both he and she find out that
farming in Ireland is no idyllic business. He
proves too weak to sta,nd the work in the
fields, and she finds that butter-making is
not exactly a romantic occupation. Mary,
who has returned from London, grows, rest-
less. The other boys are appealed to for
funds, but without effect. One son has stayed
on the farm; and his opinion of education
is forcible. When the old school-teacher
proudly says: “The boys and girls who are
scattered over the world are my monument.
I have mv reward in the thought of them
and the sight of them sometimes coming home
looking like gentlemen,” Maurice quietly
says: “D’ye know the reward I’d give you?
I’d take you west to the quarry and I’d throw
you down the cliff and break your bloody
neck, the way you’d do no more harm to
the place.” . „
Unexpectedly Mary receives £5O from her
brother Patrick. But Jack grows suspicious:
his wife has already become uneasy about
Mary; and he drags the truth from his sister.
The money had come from another man.
“Typing didn’t pay,” Mary says, “so I
I found a more paying profession 1 went
into it deliberately with my eyes open. You
see, a woman 1 knew chucked typing and
went in for this. . . .and I saw what a splen-
did time she had, and how happy she was-
and I was miserably unhappy—and how she
.had everything she wanted, and I had no-
thing, and.... and.... But this life made tue
unhappy, too; and so, in desperation, I came
back; but I’ve grown too far away from it
all, and now I’m going back. ...l m not
sacrificing myself. .. . I’m not happy here. I
thought if I could get home to the farm and
the old simple life it would be all right, but
it isn’t. Everything jars on me.. ..1 cant
give it up. I'm longing for that life, and
its excitement and splendor and color. i
want it all, all that dreadful, splendid life
... .1 must go, on, on. . . . We’re all like that,
all except Maurice and father; and, Jack,
I’m so terrified that somehow or other—in
some indirect way—they may come under the
influence that has destroyed us.”
Then Jack tells her that their father lias
set fire to his buildings to .get compensation;
and Mary sees that there are no exceptions
in the Hurley family. Breaking into hysteri-
cal laughter.she cries : “And I thought he was
so simple, so innocent, so unspoiled. Uh,
Jack, how. . . .how killingly. tunny ! Why,
we’re all equally bad now —he and I—we
both sell ourselves, he for the price of those
old houses and I for a few years of splendor
and happiness I don’t care now, I can
enjoy my life thoroughly. Nothing on earth
will stop me going.”
The old schoolmaster enters, overflowing
with his simple nrido. “It was good, sound
seed I sowed long ago in the little school-
house, and it’s to-day you’re all reaping the
rich harvest.” And Mary cruelly tells him
of the harvest the Hurley family is reaping
But the old man will not understand. And
Jack, after a violent quarrel with his wife,
follows his sister from the old home. He is
going to put “a few thousand miles of clean
salt water” between him and Ireland.
From its idvllic beginning to its culmina-
tion in the harshest of realities, the develop-
ment of the play is masterly; and the device
of keeping the secret' of the rottenness of the
Hurleys from the old schoolmaster adds a
softening touch to a fine tragedy.
The Clancy Name is a brilliant one-acter,
in which ah‘old mother keens the fact that
her only son is a murderer from the curious
neighbors, gathered about the bedside
dying man. In these two plays Lennox Rob-
inson portrays the essential Ireland more con-
vincingly than Shaw has done in his cefe-
brated Irish comedy.
Maoriland is probably the finest country
in the world for Alpine climbing; and its
towering mountain ranges, with the snow-
line much lower than in other countries, have
developed an adventurous race of mountain-
eers. There have been good books written
by Englishmen on Maoriland Alpine climb-
ing • but A Climber in New Zealand (Arnold,
per Sydney Rook Club), a record of what
the Maorilanders have done, is equal to the
best. Malcolm Ross was one of the first to
feel the attraction of the sport, and he is
thus fully qualified to write the record of
Maoriland climbing. The Maorilanders
have this 1 to their credit: they had to learn
the game themselves, to perfect their methods
with but ■slight assistance from outside.
This history of the conquest of the Maori-
land summits is rather too voluminously
written, and in a style too adjectival and too
full of cliches. But it is a stirring refcord cl
adventure and endurance. It is admirably
illustrated from the author’s own photo-
graphs.
The six “best sellers” in the United States
last year werei The Inside of the Cup, by
Winston Churchill: F.F.’s Eyes, by Henry
Sydnor Harrison; The Heart of the Hills,
by John Fox; The Amateur Gentleman, by
Jeffery Farnol; The Judgment House, by
Gilbert Parker ; and Laddie, l.y Gene Strat-
ton-Porter. Four out of the six are by
American authors, and the books selected
are merely minor work by authors who have
done better. _________

Self-Loading Shotgun
12 GAUGE, TAKE-DOWN
Since its introduction, sportsmen
have subjected this gun to almost
every conceivable test. In no
fair trial has it failed to stand up
or prove its supremacy. Its
Nickel Steel construction gives
strength to shoot maximum loads
with safety, and its reloading
system the ability to handle the
lightest or heaviest loads without
tinkering the action. In this gun
the “kick” is minimized to the
last degree. It has other dis-
tinctive features to recommend
it, as ap inspection will show.

I am a living witness to the marvellous curative
properties of
VITADATIO
Eighteen years ago I was declared absolutely
incurable by three of the finest physicians in New
Zealand. I had suffered for fourteen years from
HYDATIDS
and had tried all the ordinary advertised
medicines, doctors, and herbalists, but without
any permanent benefit, and at last underwent an
operation, but was then pronounced incurable.
I was advised to try'VITADATIO, and as a
result of giving this now famous medicine a
consistent trial, was thoroughly cured. My cure
took place seventeen years ago, and I am still in
PERFECT HEALTH
and have introduced this great medicine through-
out the world, and marvellous cures have been
effected by Australia’s Great Remedy in all
countries.

SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO SUFFER FROM
INSOMNIA AND NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.
The following is a testimony to the nerve-restoring powers of
Clements Tonic. One of the most brain-racking of duties is that of
public-school teaching—correctly training “ the young idea how to
shoot," making pupils perfect by examination time —these great de-
partmental worries make nervous breakdown and insomnia common
ailments amongst the rank and file of public school teachers. This
letter is from a lady who has been a brilliant example of her pro-
fession, having held the following high appointments in the Educa-
tional Department of New South Wales :
First Assistant Fort Street Model School for Girls.
Mistress, East St. Leonard’s School.
Assistant Mistress, Cleveland Street Public School.
Mistress, West Redfern Public School.
This testimony must appeal with commanding force to each member
of the Educational Department, showing what a nerve-soothing,
insomnia-killing, and health-restoring medicine they have in Clements
Tonic. All they need do is to try and persevere with it. The rest
with health arecertain. Miss CARDWELL writes from her resi-
dence, “ Coree,” 45 Booth Street, Annandale, 27/8/13, thus :
GLEMENTS TONIC LTD.
“I have great pleasure in giving my testimony to the benefits derived
from Clements Tonic as a builder up when in a run-down condition.
“When teaching in the State Schools of New South Wales, I many
times resorted to its use, taking one to three bottles in course.
“The ever-constant strain on the nerves of a Public School Teacher
soon brings on a low state of the whole system. In my case it was over-
strain in teaching, and mental worry through family bereavements. 1 had
been taking prescribed medicines, but seeing Clements Tonic advertised, I tried
one small bottle, and feeling so much benefit from its use, got the larger size.
It was such a restorative that when 1 felt the least run-down, I at once sent for
Clements Ton e, and it never failed me. No household should be without it,
or fail to use it in any case of over-strain, for I feel sare it will have the
desired effect."
I am, Sirs, gratefully yours,

Query : “ How did you
first come to use Pebeco
Tooth Paste?”
Answer: “My whole
family, you mean. It’s this
way! Upon leaving the
dentist after a recent call,
he was insistent that I use
Pebeco Tooth Paste—said
it was the scientific prepara-
tion of a celebrated German
Chemist—that there really
was no dentifrice quite like
it because it hygienically
revitalized the entire oral
cavity and prevented ‘Acid-
Mouth’—the cause of 95
per cent, of all tooth decay.
P€B€CO
TOOTH PASTE
“ I followed his instructions and found
the Dentist was right. Pebeco Tooth
Paste does purify and refresh the
mouth. Pebeco Tooth Paste does
stop ‘Acid-Mouth.’
“ Naturally, wife and children triedit.
Lik? it? They too have ‘got’ the
Pebeco habit.”

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Clo’es!
The Bishop remarked at a recent Church Confer-
ence that the degradation of the Papuan commenced
with the adoption of European clothes.— Cablegram.
The bucks up there in Papua is mostly big
an’ tall. *
They never worried years ago about their
togs at all.
Just sunshine and fresh air it took to cloak
’em neck to knees,&
While just a grassy petticut put Madam at
her ease;
O’ course they ’ad their quarrels
But their preshus ’eathen morruls
Were ltep’ secure and safe an’ pure, as every-
body knows,
An’ never took no ’arm at all until the Dawn
o’ Clo’es.
The cannibal’s a cannibal —but w’ere’s the
’arm o’ that?
Don’t Christians get each other down an
squash each other’s hat?
Don’t Christians bludgeon through the week
each other’s damaged ’ead
And then upraise their Sunday praise that
’eathendom is dead?
But life in brother Fuzzy
An’ his mop-’aired sister ’ussy
Is fairly inoffensive to a well-conducted nose
Until the pair comb out their ’air and trot
abroad in Clo’es.
Alas ! ’ow weak and poor a thing is brittle
human law,
It breaks agin our pashuns like a feeble thing
o’ straw;
There ain’t no Ten Commandments east o
Suez warbles Rud-
Yard Kipling, and the cove is right—wen
Clo’es get in the blood.
Right down from Mother Eve
Who practised to deceive
The fig-leaf an’ the Summer ’At, Low Neck
an’ ’Arem Skirt
’Ave done their best to bag an drag our
Morruls in the Dirt!
Wot is the aim o’ Finery—l mean the female
kind ?
It’s simply meant with sly intent to rouse a
feller’s mind,
An’ make ’im think —as man ’as thought-
since Adam’s bloomin’ fall ,
It ’ides a sort o’ Paradise w’ere Nothin s id
at all;
’Tis Togs that drive us silly
On Tot an’ Dot an’ Tilly.
An’ well the wenches know it, for their out-
fit plainly shows
Their trust an’ ’ope is “Give ’im rope an’ let
’im see the Clo’es!”
The Bishop ’e ’as said it —an’ a Bishop orter
know — .
(Just notice wot a scorn o’ togs their Noble
Gaiters show.)
Just notice wot a simple garb the Igher
Clergy wear
In any grand cathedral when the proud
procesh is there ;
Not fisherman-like raiment.
Despisin’ pelf an’ payment.
But glossy blacks and scarlets from (he eye-
brows to the toes
Show up ’ow great the deadly ’ate that
Bishops ’ave to Clo’es!
O’ course the simple Papuan—if once you let
’im loose
And put ’im in some one-bob pants, you raise
the Very Deuce ;
An’ if you fix ’is fancy girl in gaudy Calico
You cannot guess the Awful Mess in which
she’s bound to go ;
So leave ’em to their croodity,
Their Long Pig an’ their noodit.y.
You cannot i aint the lily and you cannot
gild the rose,
Nor mend the boundin’ savage with a suit o
Mission Clo’es!

The Measured Road.
The milestones lie along the Road —-
A blithesome road for some —
A road of song that winds along
Through glowing Fairydom.
Good fairies hand them sweets to eat
And velvet cloaks to wear ;
Sweet thoughts to think and wine to drink,
And fancies free of care.
’Twixt stone and stone upon that road
They find sure food for joy;
From rise of sun till day be done,
Pure gold without alloy,
With cup aslant and goodly jest
Youth bears them company
A-many miles —till Age, with smiles,
Receives them merrily.
In truth, it is a blithesome road —
A merry road for some —
A road of song, that winds along
Through glowing Fairydom.
* * * *
The milestones lie along tire road —
An evil road for more;
A road of Wrong that winds along
Through regions wild and hoar.
’Twixt stone and stone upon that road
The cheated pilgrims meet,
With blighted flower and bliss turned sour,
And sweets made bitter-sweet.
Dark spirits plague them on their way,
From morn till sunset red ;
Give cares untold and dross for gold
And store in place of bread.
Along the road, a swindled host
And tired-of-foot, they go;
They know not youth, hut (this is truth)
Grey Age-in-Youth they know.
What then, if when their sun goes down
And all their milestones end,
With labored breath they run to Death —
Arms wide—as to a friend?

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some
care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE ALLEGED HIGH PRICE OF
MEAT AND THE LATENESS OF
THE SYDNEY-MELBOURNE EX-
PRESS.
The writer of this article has before him
two quarts of press cuttings, all collected
during the last fortnight, about the high
price of meat; also a pint of cuttings, also
collected within the last fortnight, about
the iniquities and machinations of the
United States Meat Trust, which is now
pervading Australia. As regards the exist-
ence of the Meat Trust, there is very little
doubt. Still it is a lazy, feckless device to
sit around and ascribe all our troubles to an
institution which has no fixed address in
this country, and no visible office or door-
plate. In older days people were wont to
charge their misfortunes to the Act of God,
or the hidden scheming of Beelzebub, who
is the God of Flies and also the Devil. On
the strength of these theories they disclaimed
all responsibility, and let things slide. This
passive aspect of mind saved them a heap
of trouble. The attitude of resignation was
supposed to count in their favor after death.
Being overwhelmed by supernatural mis-
fortune they could only be humble, and
smoke a clay pipe on an ash-heap, after
the manner of Job, the patriarch. It is
just possible that, to some extent, the Meat
Trust idea is being run, like the Act of God
and the hidden scheming of the Devil, as a
cover for incapacity and other diseases'.

There is nothing unprecedented about the
present cost of living. Things were much
worse at certain old, dead, bygone dates,
when wages were lower, and working hours
were longer, and Trusts were not yet in-
vented. Eggs were 4s. a dozen at Sydney
in 1838. Bacon averaged Is. 41d. per lb.
in 1854. Bread was llld. per 21b. loaf in
1839. Beef cost 6d. per lb. as far back as
1825. In 1854 the value of lcwt. of pota-
toes reached £1 Is. 4d. Butter has sold in
Sydney for 3s. 6d. per lb., and cheese for 2s.
These disasters happened in days when rail-
ways were not; when roads had only
just made their appearance; and when, in
the absence of steamships, the old wind-
jammer came and went as it listed. They
are mentioned merely to show that the
present situation isn’t so astonishing as
some people suppose. The increase in the
Cost of Living has always been with us.
Instead of being a new development it is
the oldest development on earth. The way
the Cost of Living went up on Setii’s wife,
as compared with the price Eve paid for
her groceries, was shameful.
One outstanding reason for high meat-
prices is plain, ordinary scarcity of meat.
Thus in 1891 the State of N.S.W. had
61,831,416 sheep. In 1912, with a far
larger population to feed, it had, despite a
succession of good seasons, only 38,855,861.
The entire stock of sheep in the Common-
wealth was 106,419,751 in 1891, and, with
a far larger population to feed, it was only
83,263,686 in 1912. The stock of cattle
was much less in 1912 than in 1896, when
the industry reached its best, l'igs dimin-
ished about 20 per cent, between 1911 and
1912. These happenings can’t be wholly
set down to the Meat Trust, which, even
according to its worst enemies, is a com-
paratively recent curse or arrival. Its
bitterest assailants reckon that it put its
cloven hoof on this soil just about two years
ago. And though it is reputed to have
bought up a number of meat-works, and
made contracts for the forward delivery of
cattle and sheep, it certainlv hasn’t, as yet.
on the evidence of the trade returns, done
anything immense in the way of exporting
cow and sheep. Of course this country has
to make a desperate attempt to export its
cow and sheep in order to keep solvent, even
if the inhabitants eat grass, but that has
nothing to do with any Meat Trust. Its
people expect to work shorter hours than
anybody else, for higher wages than any-
body else, and to have a higher standard of
comfort than most people. Therefore, pro-
duction is expensive. And as the workers
keep the tariff low, out of subservience and
grovel to the Tory Argus and Sydney
Telegraph and S. M. Herald, the biggest
mass of sweated labor imports (per head)
on record climbs over the inefficient tariff
barrier. And the biggest mass of foreign
loans (per head) on record are incurred to
pay for these sweated labor imports. And
every year it is necessary to send away
more lOU’s and wool and gold and cow-
meat and sheep-meat and hides and base
metals to cover the interest on the loans
that were floated to pay for the sweated
labor goods that were brought in because
the Australian preferred to go to the foot-
ball match rather than do his own manu-
facturing. The Meat Trust isn’t respon-
sible for the fact that the interest bill grows
larger every year, and the gold out-
put grows smaller, and more and more of
the bill has to be paid in exported produce.
One reason for the High Cost of Living
is the fact that the Melbourne-Sydney
express has only once, in the last three
months, reached the end of its journey with
punctuality. This train doesn’t carry
cattle, yet the fact that it grows more and
more belated has some bearing on the case.
The two prize trains of Australia are those
that run between Melbourne and Sydney
and Melbourne and Adelaide. The Mel-
bourne express, which becomes steadily
worse in its habits, has first claim on the
right of way all along its journey. It is a
sort of preference shareholder. The plainer
and humbler mail train plods behind and
takes whatever right-of-way the gaudy
express has left to it. The wayside pas-
senger traJn, having given way to these
pompous predecessors, does the best it can.
The “fast goods” is a mild and ruined
crawler at the back of the wayside pas-
senger train. The “mixed” (sometimes
called a “Limerick”) benefits by any
chances it can get, and arrives tO-morrow,
or perhaps next week. It is the dog that
eats the crumbs under its master’s table.
The cattle-train has fifth or sixth mortgage
on the highway. It is the dog that licked
Lazarus. And behind it toddles the ordi-
nary “goods” loaded with wheat and pota-
toes and onions, and at the back of that
is anything that doesn’t signify, or that
doesn’t amount to 2d., or that isn’t worth a
tinker’s malediction —coal, gravel, road-
metal and the rag-tag and bobtail of traffic.
As the express grows later the other trains
grow later. The difficulty of getting the
cow to market becomes memorable. The
cost of getting it there increases. The
amount of it that dies on the road increases.
The value of such cow as arrives doesn’t
increase, though the price of it does. In
one recent week the Meat Trust (or some-
thing) had such a poor time in N.S.W.
that no beef was exported and onlv four
dead sheep. The Government was floating
another loan in London —out of which it
paid the current interest bill, thus liquidat-
ing Cohen’s liability with Cohen’s own
money. So it wasn’t necessary just then to
send half a million sheep and cattle and a
heap of pi?s to England to keep the national
accounts fn a state of apnarent solvency.
Yet in that week, when N.S.W. exported
four sheep and no cattle, the price of meat
rose again in Sydney.
Australia, by reason of its scanty rain-
fall, is not a wildly fertile country. It is
necessary to cultivate more acres here in
order to raise a given quantity of wheat,
and to chase over more acres in order to
rear a sheep or a bullock than happens to
many other lands. It is possible to get
farther from the coast and farther from a
navigable river in Australia than in any
other continent except Asia. Australia is
the place above all others in which every
deep-water port should be developed, and
every place should be supplied with the
shortest and cheapest communication with
the most adjacent port. It should make up
for its lack of navigable rivers, and its
scarcity of coast-line, and its shortage in
the matter of good ports, by making every
possible use of such ports as it possesses.
Unfortunately it has got into the habit of
keeping most of its deep-water harbors un-
developed. It has also got into the habit
of crowding most of its new population into
two or three big cities. And as the suburban
traffic grows, the lines become more con-
gested, 'and the long-distarice trade becomes
more unmanageable, and thfe Melbourne-
Sydney express becomes more unpunctual.
Also the very long-distance cow-and-sheep
train becomes less profitable to all parties
concerned.
A Trust, whether Meat or otherwise,
cannot get a hold in Australia such as it
can acquire in Britain or the United States,
because it cannot get a lien on a great
Private Enterprise railway system, and
arrange favorable terms for itself and bad
terms for its competitors. It is easy, in a
country which possesses adult suffrage, to
prevent it getting special concessions from
Private Enterprise steamship companies,
and to annul and disqualify forward con-
tracts for the delivery of cattle, and
to put a ruinous export duty on meat —at
least, the last proposition would be easy
save for the fact that Australia is so deeply
mortgaged to foreign money-lenders that it
has to do a vast export business in meat,
wool, hides, skins, bones and horns to cover
the interest bill. But the One Big City
Trust is a much more difficult affair than
the Meat Trust. As the Sydney-Melbourne
express becomes more dilatory and more
belated and more bogged, the arrival of the
cow. which runs far behind it with a fourth
or fifth or sixth mortgage on the lino im-
paled on its horn, becomes more precarious.
And precariousness has to be paid for, like
everything else.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Misguided Economy.
Nothing but a bowdlerised summary of
General Hamilton’s report on the Austra-
lian army has yet been made available for
publication. The following passage, how-
ever, draws attention to at least one matter
that was in urgent need of ventilation
The centralisation in the Defence Department at
Melbourne exceeds anything I have experienced during
more than 40 years’ service. The condition of affairs
in the United Kingdom in 1904 (described by the
Esher Committee as futile in peace and ruinous in
war) is reproduced in an exaggerated form in Aus-
tralia.
The present Defence Minister doesn’t agree
with the above sentiments, and his prede-
cessor, Senator; Pearce, is also of the opinion
that they are all wrong. But this is only
to say that these two men are politicians.
Centralisation in the matter of defence is a
device to save money. When every ten-
pound-note that is spent by every command-
ing officer from Perth to Brisbane has to
be authorised by a Melbourne official who is
in daily touch with the Minister, it is argu-
able that a large amount of cash will not
be spent that in other circumstances might
have been spent. The Minister is thus
enabled to make an impressive figure as an
economist. Incidentally, the arrangement
is liable to interfere disastrously with the
efficiency of the forces. Under existing con-
ditions no Commandant can write a cheque
for more than £5 without referring the mat-
ter to the Finance Member of the Defence
Board. A Commandant has to get permis-
sion from Melbourne if he thinks fit to hold
so much as a week-end camp. The effegt
is pernicious in two directions, at thp very
least. In the first place, it hinders training
and saps enthusiasm. A Commandant will
do a lot of work of his own initiative that
he will hesitate to undertake if he knows
that interminable and absurd correspond-
ence is to be the outcome of it. And,
secondly, the system, since it has the effect
practically of turning the Commandant into
a cheap rubber stamp, tends to ruin his
own usefulness from a military standpoint.
The centralisation system has certain obvious
points of merit while the country is at
peace; and the railways are running more
or less punctually; and the post-office is
un-dynamited; and the mails are being de-
livered ; and a delay of a week or so does
not make much difference anyhow. In such
circumstances the policy of keeping an iron
grip on the different Commandants of the
Commonwealth is bound to redound favor-
ably on the Treasurer’s surplus. But when
war comes in at the window, leisure departs
with a howl over the back fence. While
bloody carnage is raging in Adelaide or Port
Darwin the Finance Member may, conceiv-
ably, be lying dead in Melbourne. Then
the; Commandant who has learned to lean on
the Finance Member in all but the paltriest
details will find himself in a difficulty. His
position will be analogous to that of a man
who, having been accustomed all his life to
working a lift, is suddenly called upon to
manage a bank. Assuming that the Mili-
tary Board remains unslain throughout the
trouble, and that communications between
Melbourne and the rest of the Commonwealth
are not broken, the resulting chaos will be
equally complete. Within a week of the
beginning of the war the Finance Member
will be snowed under with correspondence
from every part of Australia. Realising the
hopelessness of”it all he will go mad, or fall
on his stylographic pen, or hang himself with
his own tape. There is only one way in
which a nation gets efficient officers of any
sort, and that is by giving them responsi-
bility. Also, there is only one means of
giving them the work-habit —a habit which
is overwhelmingly valuable in war-time —
and that is by seeing that they get oppor-
tunities to work in the drowsy summer
neriods of peace. The present system kills
initiative on the part of the Commandant;
and, if he is inclined to take things easy,
it gives him an excuse to be more languid
than nature made him. Instead of dower-
ing commissioned officers with full authority
to look after their companies, batteries, bat-
talions and squadrons, and see that all the
men in them have their proper equipment, it
reduces their job to a matter of drilling the
men and drawing up reports and returns.
As above-mentioned, it has one justification
—the fact that it tends to save money. But
since all Commandants are not necessarily
spendthrifts or mishandlers of public funds
—since, in fact, very few of them are —the
saving in this direction is inconsiderable.
And, if it were otherwise, the position would
be the same. The insurance of Australia
against a successful invasion is worth sev-
eral masses.

The Control of the Pawn Money.
Jack Scaddan, Premier of Westralia, has
explained all about it. The lion in the
path of the transfer of the debts is not the
difficulty of passing over the £300,000,000
or so of lOU’s already existing, but the
fear that the Commonwealth may bring in-
fluence to bear to keen some of the States
from being in future such hard borrowers os
they hope to be —or as their present leaders
hope they will be. “Westralia knows best
how much money it needs,” says Scaddan
in more words. Of course this really means
that John Scaddan thinks he knows best
what money Westralia needs. Westralia
itself certainly never authorised John to
borrow the amazing amount he did last
year. In fact, when it put John in power,
it understood that he was a non-borrower, or
at any rate a person who had grave doubts
about the wisdom of hard borrowing. There
probably never was a branch manager of a
bank who didn’t think he knew how much
his branch ought to lend. But the sane
branch manager knows also that he is part
of an organisation ; if he didn’t, and if he
were not subject to the control of a central
authority which knows the requirements of
all the branches, the whole bank would soon
be in trouble. What John Scapdan and
some other local Premiers don’t seem to rea-
lise is that their States are only part of a
whole, too, and that the whole is greater than
the part. The Bulletin has no hesitation
in saying that if in the interests of Australia
it should be desirable to for a time use every
penny of loan money available for Australia
in one State of Australia, the money should
be spent there and the other States should
be obliged to stand back. This of course
means that, if circumstances called for it,
the Commonwealth would control Australian
borrowings and spendings. And so it should.
There can be no other contention from the
National point of view.
Big Loans and Small Wages.
Among the 072 reforms and other things
alleged to have been foreshadowed by the
N.S.W. Government, are a 44-hour week and
a £3 minimum wage. Tile Bulletin cor-
dially approves of both. Every able-bodied
man should earn £3 in a week of 44 hours.
But he must do the right thing and work
hard enough at the job. No body of men
can for long get more than they earn, and
no country’s pint-pot can for long pour out
more than has first been poured into it.
Before a Government makes a law declar-
ing that all men shall get £3 a week, and no
man shall work more than 44 hours, it
ought therefore to make a law prohibiting
any land from yielding less than 15 bushels
of wheat, any sheep from giving less than
101 b. of wool, any goldmine from yielding
less than lOoz. to the ton, and any copper-
mine less than 3 per cent, of the Titian
metal. When we have got that law into
good working order the rest will be easy,
and the billet of Arbitration Court Judges
will be almost a sinecure. Until then this
paper is afraid those Judges will have a lot
of work to do, and that their work will not
stand unless their awards are based, not on
what men ought to get, but on what they
earn. In an absolutely self-contained coun-
try, which either grew or manufactured all
its own requirements, and didn’t import
any rice or calico, or road-rollers or family
bibles, and had no foreign public or private
debt, and therefore didn’t have to pay inter-
est to any outside creditor, it would not
matter two gum-leaves whether the mini-
mum wage was fixed at £3 or £3O. If it
were fixed at £3O the butcher would have
to charge about 10s. a pound for sausages;
but, as the carpenter would be getting £5 a
day, his missus could just as well or just
as badly afford to pay 10s. then as she can
Sd. now. But when a country isn’t self-
contained, and when it does import calico
and rice and road-rollers and family bibles,
and when it has got a foreign debt and has
to pay interest to the outsider, things are
altogether different: we have to send stuff
away to pay for the foreign goods and satisfy
the foreign creditor, and that stuff has to be
sold in competition with similar stuff from
other parts of the world. If we export
sausages it is no use explaining that it cost
us 10s. a pound to produce them; having
foreign bills to pay we must sell the goods
and we can’t get more for them than others
are willing to produce them for. So the
more goods we import, and particularly the
more money we borrow from J. Bull
Coiien and other foreign moneylenders, the
mone difficult will it be for us to maintain
higher scales of wages or better conditions
of labor than prevail elsewhere.
♦
Through Others’ Glasses.
One of Victoria’s representative citizens —a
Rich Landlord, City Councillor, etc. —was
recently given some instructions on the
duties "of public men by a common plain-
clothes constable. It was sound instruction,
too, though so far as can be seen, it failed
to do the recipient much good. The matter
arose through the examination by the Com-
mission on Housing of Constable Scott,
whose duty it is to cast an eye on the slums
that lie at the back of big Bourke-street
and the parts adjacent. Scott had told
the Commission —then a Select Committee
—things about these slums as long ago as
last November, and now he repeated and
emphasised his remarks. “There are,” he
said, “in one particular city block a score of
miserable hovels, absolutely unfit for habita-
tion ; dark dens into which no light can
enter, damp and dilapidated. The area is
not one for dwellings, yet children exist
there, and a mixed population of Syrians,


Indians, Chinese and half-castes.’ No im-
provements had been . effected since he xe-
ported on the matter six months ago. Seven
Chinese factories had undated condemnation
notices posted on the doors, but that was
all. Not one dwelling-house had been con-
demned. Just here one Aikman (the above-
mentioned representative citizen) interposed.
Speaking as alderman for the assailed ward
he assured the interfering constable that he
(the J. Hop) didn’t know what he was talk-
ing about. “When we serve condemnation
notices,” he explained, “there is always a
little delay. The landlord may be preparing
plans for improvements. We cannot go
bald-headed at them; we must proceed
cautiously. We have to go through certain
forms. What you should do is to loolc
through the glasses of the owner of these
places. He has paid so much for the pro-
perty and people are willing to live in it,
but you want us to step in and condemn it
forthwith. If the tenants are satisfied why
should we interfere?" The answer was
prompt: “I would say that if people have
not a better idea of living than that the
sooner they are taught how to live and pro-
tected against themselves the better.”
Aikman then fell back on the plea that the
City Council had not sufficient power. How-
ever, Chairman Solly, M.L.A., reminded
him that, under the Health Act, a municipal
council may, on the certificate of a health
officer, or of an inspector, or of two ordinary
medical practitioners, summarily condemn
any building and order its removal or demo-
lition. Whereupon Aikman subsided. But
he arose in haste, and scandalised astonish-
ment when another member asked the
constable if he could supply the names
of the owners of these hovels. “It is not
necessary; not at all,” protested Aikman.
Other constables told of landlords in South
Melbourne who had slightly improved their
dubious properties and had promptly—and
without the faintest trace of preliminary
caution —raised the rents by from 6d. to
3s. 6d. per week. But Aikman, who. is a
landlord himself, still held to the view that
city landlords are a maligned and misjudged
race. His idea is that the situation should
be viewed, as he puts it, “through their
glasses,” and not through those of the ten-
ants who suffer directly, or of the public
which suffers indirectly, through the land-
lords’ greed. All of which moves this paper
to suggest to this sort of landlord that other
matters might also be viewed through other
glasses. If, for instance, a landlord’s
cashier gets away with some thousands of
the said landlord’s cash, he should not be
prosecuted when found out and ordered to
refund or go to gaol. The matter should
be viewed through his glasses. His em-
ployer put him in a position to annex the
cash and he annexed it. When found out
he couldn’t refund the entire sum. because
he had hypothecated some of it, but he was
willing to compromise. Why then should
the law sten in and punish him for his
wrong-doing? M’hy could it not look at the
matter in a broad frame of mind from his
view-point? Also, why show any indecent
haste? Why not “proceed cautiously”?
This business of looking at things through
the proper glasses has never been undertaken
with proper thoroughness.
A Policy of Preference to Litigants.
Foe years there has been dissatisfaction in
the Maitland (N.S.W.) collieries over
what is known as the “night shift’
question. No coalminer is forced, of
course, to go on night shift; but
human nature being what it is, and
wages a necessity, when the bell goes the
toiler mostly transpires and the job is begun.
Nevertheless, the miners, as a community,
hate, and always have hated, this arrange-
ment by which a section of them are de-
prived of practically all home life; by which
their homes are disorganised; and by which
their wives or mothers or sisters, as the case
may be, are caused an infinity of needless
work. About six months ago the proprie-
tors of three Maitland collieries (the Aber-
dare, Neath and Abermain) came to the
conclusion either that further resistance
wasn’t a fair thing, or that it wasn’t safe
industrially, and agreed privately with their
employees to do away with the night shift.
Not so that stark old trouble-seeker and
chronic litigant, John Brown, and several
other Newcastle colliery-owners of a like
kidney. They decided to fight the men on
the night-shift issue before the Arbitration
Court. Last week Judge Edmunds deliv-
ered his decision in the matter. It was per-
haps the most amazing effort of its kind on
record. The award allows, during a period
of three years from the date of its deliver-
ance, the John Brown and other uncom-
promising night-shift mine proprietors to
go on as they have done in the past, and
pay their men nothing extra for the privi-
lege. On the other hand, those mines which
voluntarily did away with the night shift,
as a matter of decent feeling or something,
are debarred from resuming it, and so get-
ting on level terms with their business rivals,
unless they pay their men a wage-increase of
25 per cent. No new colliery is to work
the night shift without paying the 25 per
cent, wage increase, though the Richmond
Main Colliery, which has not yet started, is
to be exempt from the penalty. And, finally,
about 98 per cent, of the Newcastle mines
are debarred from working the night shift
unless they pay the 25 per cent, impost.
If Judge Edmunds had done away with the
night shift altogether —a course he might
well have taken, in view of the fact that
those big collieries have shown that it is
possible to work to a profit with one shift —
the public would have had cause for satis-
faction. If he had said to John Brown
and his colleagues: “You may work the
extra shift if you like, but you must pay
it would have been a fair thing in many
respects. But to penalise colliery-owners
for no other apparent reason than that they
have met their men half-way, and so done
something to avert the sort of hold-up which
is the curse of industrialism locally, bears
no resemblance to justice. It amounts to a
policy of preference to litigants and trouble-
brewers. What chiefly concerns this paper,
however, is the relation of the position to
the public welfare. An inevitable effect
must be co raise a fresh and vigorous crop
of strikes. The men detest the night-shift
system. It affects the whole of their social
life. The least faint shadow of a reason
will suffice to bring them out on this issue.
An obvious development is for the collieries
which have been discriminated against to
decide to pay their men the 25 per cent, in-
crease and resume the night shift. A first
result will be the flocking of the cream of the
labor market to their collieries. The second,
a strike among those men who are expected
to work the night shift without any incre-
ment. The irreconcilable mine-owners will
suffer a little by this; the workers a little
more; and the unhappy public, which pays
for Judge Edmunds and his futile Court,
will suffer a great deal. Another and equally
unfortunate aspect of the award is its
method of dealing with what one may term
the decent employer. Here was one of
those rare cases where several employers
came together and tried to do the right thing
by the men, even though in doing
so they went against their own interests.
It was a manifestation of the slowly-dawn-
ing understanding, among the moneyed
classes, that the working-man has certain
social as well as strictly legal rights. The
Law’s method of indicating its appreciation
of this class of employer is, in effect, to step
briskly forward and hit him over the head
with a brick. It puts the Law, for perhaps
the first time in history, in much the same
class as the anarchist.
State Frights cost this country a great
deal of money and sacrifice a great deal
of efficiency. Also they lead to a great
deal of corruption. As a case in point, it
was recently mentioned that in certain dis-
tricts of N,S.W. —from Penrith on one side
of the mountains to Bathurst on the other
—there are 2000 more names on the State
electoral roll than on the Federal one. In-
cidentally, there are 5166 names on the
Federal roll that don’t appear on the State
document, and 5835 names on the State
roll that are not on the Federal publica-
tion. The people who are dead, the people
who have removed, and the people who
never existed are big features on the elec-
toral list. Then there are the real people
who didn’t happen to get on. Anybody can
fill in an application form in the name
of Artaxerxes Smith or Maximilian
Jones or Elizabeth Alexandrina Vic-
toria Thomson, and be registered. Anybody
who gets to the polling booth first can vote
in anybody else’s name, provided he or she
doesn’t happen to be identified and bowled
out. The names of the dead, the gone and
the unborn cr non-existent are available for
voting purposes to any party which cares
to use them. The discrepancy between
Federal and State rolls merely suggiests
that instead of there being one swindle or
incapacity there are two, and the two have
got mixed. The dead or vanished or
imaginary State voter and the same kind
of Federal voter don’t correspond. If the
State and Federal electorates were made
identical, and there was only one roll, and
the money that is now spent on compiling
the second roll was devoted to finding out
whether Wilhelmina Skeggs is really the
qualified elector she purports to be, and in
putting Rebecca Sharp on the roll where
she ought to be, the business might be
cleaner and less confused than it is.
One lad’s festival is another’s “40s. or a
month.” The Sydney University under-
grads held their annual procession on Satur-
day last, and the paternal daily press, whilst
cackling proudly over the “antics” of the
boys, felt bound to edge in the remark that
an item here and there “was not in good
taste.” A carefully subdued correspondent
of one dear old sheet mentioned that ‘the
behavior of a few lads dressed as females
left a lot to be desired” —or prattle to the
same effect. Then the subject was consider-
ately dropped, and a verse from one ot tne
songlets relating to the new system ot fetate
bursaries was quoted :
Come along, Undergrads., and grab a bursary ;
All the Lizzies and the Lils
And the nuts of Surrv Hills
Are going to be dubbed M.B.
The silly little snob who wrote that may
have been one of the sham females whose
conduct in the public street was bad enough
to merit a gentle reproof from his sympa-
thetic friends. If so, he may get a free
lesson in manners by putting on his carnival
rags and repeating the experiment at Surry
Hills some time when there is no University
performance on, and the _ police are tree to
arrest any person who seems to require it.
Then his humor will be duly reported under
some such heading as “Street Ruffianism,
and he will be fined in an ordinary police-
court. He may even be sent to gaol in the
Surry Hills manner, unless his long-suffering
dad pays the fine. Poor old dad! It is his
money that enables a silly young son to play
the fool and jeer at the less fortunate boy
or girl of talent towards whom the State is
temporarily acting as godfather.
+ ;
Paris Nesbit, K.C., whose blows never lack
vigor, though they often lack judgment, is
giving his attention now to the totalisator.
It is “disgusting hypocrisy,” he says, for a
Government to pretend to want to suppress
gambling and then take 2J per cent, of the
investments in the totalisator which is no
better argument than it would be to say
that a magistrate who fines a man os. for
drunkenness can’t be in earnest if he says
he wants to abolish drunkenness. i>nt this
is the point with which The Bulletin is
most concerned :
The totalisator system is the product of an unholy
alliance between the people who object to gambling
altogether and the racing men who own the machine
and want the people to use it.
It is nothing of the sort. The totalisator is
the product of a determination to eliminate
the bookmaker, who, besides being a non-
productive member of the community, and
therefore an incubus on the workers, is a
menace to the purity of the sport. The
totalisator “squares” nobody; it takes no-
body down ; it gives fair odds to those of the
public who will bet; and it isn’t a noisy,
lurid blot on the landscape.
“Whitehall” : Galsworthy, the English
dramatist, has just written a play called
“The Mob.” It tells that dull, charlatan-
led aggregation of unimaginatives what a
man of intelligence thinks about them. The
central figure is a politician who has to
decide between following the crowd and
howling for an unjust war, or following his
conscience, and voicing the claims of the
enemy. He follows his conscience. _ The
crowd —the noisier section of it,_ that is to
say —goes mad with hatred of him, just as
it went mad with hatred of Lloyd-George,
General Butler and other outspoken public
men during the Boer war a dozen years
ago He is driven from public life; his
house is stoned, as Wellington’s was, when
he went against the mob of his day; ulti-
mately he is killed. Years afterwards the
mob —the same mob which killed him is
shown canonizing him, the war fever hav-
ing completely subsided. The history of
Galsworthy’s puppet is, in a greater or
lesser degree, the history of every man or
woman possessed of the capacity to see
ahead ever so little, and the nerve to
describe the resulting vision in plain terms.
In Australia, the other day, the man who
wasn’t a Dreadnoughter was, in the eyes
of the Mob, a “Dingo.” At the present
moment the Cook Government , is enjoying
a kind of vicarious canonization, as fer-
vent Australian navyites. Only . a year
ago Cook and his colleagues were vituperat-
ing Fisher’s “baby bonus” as something
unspeakably pernicious. On Friday last,
Dr. Charles Mackellar, of Sydney,
an expert in the care of children, and an
influential Liberal, extolled the baby bonus.
One could fill The Bulletin with a list of
the wise reforms which have been howled at
by the mob —meaning such people as pro-
minent merchants, importers, bank directors
and squatters, and such institutions as the
Sydney Telegraph and the Melbourne
Argus —and which have been taken to the
hearts of these same folks later on. At
present the mob regards the man who says
that the Northern Territory is habitable
for white men as a dangerous ruffian of the
blatantly insane order. To-morrow Ins
views will be accepted as commonplaces.
To-dav the N. S. Welshman who argues
that Yass-Canberra is a rotten site for a
capital is damned as a traitor to the State.
In a little while the accusation will have
become a truism and a platitude. The
trouble is that years of precious time are
wasted during the period in which the mob
is gradually acquiring sense. It is all very
deplorable.
Six or eight months ago, while the remodel-
ling of Beard Watson’s premises was in
progress in Sydney, there was a violent
smash, and the whole place was a wreck-
such a wreck that Beard Watson’s had to
clear out into other premises and carry on
their business there. Then the row started.
Beard Watson’s were tenants; the Dixson
Trust was the landlord, and the landlord was
carrying out the alterations, and had under-
taken to do the work in such a way that the
tenant’s business would not be interfered
with Hence Beard Watson’s wanted
damages—£4o,ooo worth of them. But the
Dixson Trust was advised that it probably
had a defence. The architect was the land-
lord’s servant and the contractor was the
landlord’s contractor; but if the Trust had
exercised reasonable care in choosing its
architect and contractor (and that seemed to
be proved by the fact that the tenant had
agreed to both), what then? Was the land-
lord still liable? The Trust pleaded that he
wasn’t, for the reason suggested above; and
the important matter went to the N.b.NV.
Full Court on a demurrer alleging that the
pleas constituted no defence. The matter
has now been argued, and the Full Court has
come to a very definite conclusion that the
pleas “can hardly be taken seriously.” The
landlord may possibly have redress against
the other parties, the persons he employed
to do certain work; but the Court, so far as
it can finally settle anything, settles this one
with an emphatic bang: the negligence (if
there was any), or the miscalculation, or
whatever it was of the architect or the con-
tractor, or both, did not relieve the landlord
of his responsibility under the agreement
with the tenant.
N.S.W. Mines Minister Cann, who used to
be a South Coast coal-liewer before he went
to Broken Hill and started to gouge silver
and talk politics, has been authorised to
wrestle in Parliament with the Coal Dust
nuisance. The farther N. S. Wales coal
mines get into the innards of the earth, and
the more truck-hauling there is to be done,
the worse the dust trouble gets; and nowa-
days it is recognised that coal dust is almost
as explosive and dangerous a substance as
fire-damp, which in the wetter mines of
Britain used to be regarded as the only
thing worth watching. In fact, in the
usual blind, blundering fashion, we have
followed methods which even in England
are now out of date, and haven’t authorised
the mining inspectors to report coal-dust as
a possible danger. Two things are clear:
tyie inspectors should have an official nose
for dust as well as damp, and the practice
of working with naked lights in dusty
mines ought to be ruled out. For the rest,
the special circumstances of every mine will
have to govern the precautionary proceed-
ings—except that a sharp eye should be
kept on the Commission’s proposal to more
or less neutralise coal dust by mixing stone
dust with it. The mixture may possibly
be inert; but stone dust is rarely good food,
and to mix it with coal dust isn’t calcu-
lated to improve it much from that point of
view.
From General lan Hamilton’s recently-
issued Defence report:—
The sooner Australia makes a beginning at being
self-contained in the matter of flying the better.
Unless certain equipment is added, the money already
spent, and the money about to be spent, in running
expenses of the school, will, to a great extent, be
wasted. With only one instructional machine it is
inevitable that the pupils will be retained in expen-
sive idleness at frequent, and often for long, inter-
vals. Nor do I think it altogether safe to send pupils
straight from the 50-h.p. instructional machine to the
fast B.E. Also, it may very likely come to be con-
sidered necessary in the near future that seaplanes
should he provided as an adjunct to the navy. But
flying is not learnt on seaplanes, but on aeroplanes.
I, therefore, recommend the provision of two addi-
tional machines for instruction, say Bristol biplanes,
with 80-h.p. engines; these would provide inter-
mediate instruction in preparation for the fast work.
The five machines which comprise the entire
aerial fleet of the Defence Department were
ordered by the Fisiiee Government in 1912.
Three of them are admittedly of use
only for ground work; and now General
Hamilton announces that the other two
that is to say, the recently unpacked B.E.
biplanes—are unsafe for instructional pur-
poses. As there is no point whatever in the
country paying out money in order that
Ministers and prominent military officers
may be taken for aerial joy-rides, the ques-
tion obtrudes itself: What does the Cook
Administration propose to do? Off its own
bat it has done nothing worth mentioning
for flying since it took office in 1913; and
aviation has gone ahead immensely and
become far more important from a military
point ,of view in the last couple of years.
Senator Pearce did his duty, according to
his lights, in 1912. It is up to Defence
Minister Millen.

“Hiki” : The medicoes of Maoriland are com-
mencing a move against the plague, syphilis,
the hideous thing that is fostered by “purity”
brigades and blasphemous cranks who hail it
as the “hand of God.” The Christchurch
Hospital Board has instituted a separate de-
partment, including an out-patient ward, for
the cure and prevention of the disease, and
in Wellington a move is also being made by
the hospital authorities. A case was before
the Courts in Christchurch recently, where
a woman was charged with keeping a house
of ill-fame. Evidence was adduced by the
police that all sorts of men visited the house.
Later on a man was charged with being a
frequenter of the joint, and. with having no
visible honest means of support. This indi-
vidual wore a mask over the lower portion of
his face, his eyes and forehead alone being
visible. <He was a far-gone sufferer from
syphilis, and yet the women of the house
were perfectly content to have him about
the premises. Several similar institutions
were cleaned up at the same time, and it
turned out that the strangely-diseased party
was known at all of them. He was proba-
tioned for a year, or ordered to come up
when called on, or something like that,
instead of being sent to the lethal chamber.

The best wholesale immigration system on
earth must necessarily rake in a fair pro-
portion of human failures. Even when men
voluntarily import themselves (as in the
case of gold-rushes), a certain number make
home again at' the first opportunity, cursing
the land they rushed to, the day they started,
the man or paper that set them off, and any
other details they can think of. But when
a State Government goes in for importing
shiploads of ordinary, stay-at-home foreign-
ers who have been carefully mesmerised be-
forehand with moving pictures of waving
wheatfields and immovable mines and dazzled
with promises and predictions of rapid for-
tune, it is bound to get an occasional back-
load of two-legged hogs and asses and sloths
who want to return to the lights o’ London,
and the cheap kipper, and the Mile End-
road, and ’Amstead ’Eath, and the- familiar
mud and misery from which they were
fished. An Australian who travelled to Eng-
land recently in the Orient boat Otranto told
a paper last week that the big ship carried
’Ome about 500 returned empties, all of
whom cursed Australia at the top of their
silly voices. There were intervals when they
ceased to libel the country that had paid for
their transportation; but at such times they
were engaged fighting for food, or stealing,
or defiling their quarters. The chances are
they would have cursed Canada or Utopia
with the same reckless enthusiasm, and it
cannot be doubted that Australia is lucky to
be rid of them at any price; these losses are
inseparable from the human-stock business as
at present conducted, and the writing-off
should be done quite cheerfully.
The Submarine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The grey of Ocean’s denseness
Surrounds her like a veil;
In silent deeps’ immenseness,
No laughing seas give hail.
But round her, rudely riven,
The sullen waters feel
Her stout hull, engine-driven,
A thrilling thing of steel
That cleaves a pathway under
The breakers’ snarling lips—
That mocks the big guns’ thunder
And scorns the battle-ships.
She goes by deeps and shallows
’Neath blue Australian seas,
Where never sun enhaloes
A wandering ocean breeze.
Yet, at her steersman’s willing,
She lifts her stalk-like eye,
To see the sunlight spilling
Its gold on sea and sky ;
And, mirrored in fair color,
The picture true is thrown,
Where, in the sea-light duller,
Her spinning engines drone.
When, with her bearings, taken,
She plunges deep again,
She is as one forsaken,
Beyond the world of men.
Yet living men tend truly,
Her tanks’ and air-valves’ flow,
And oil her engines duly,
For it was ordered so.
Aye, though beyond the borders
Of human worlds they be,
Their orders still are orders
And what avails the sea?
’Neath bright electrics’ glowing,
They reck not that outside,
In age-long course, is flowing
The grey-green under-tide.
By periscope and needle
And pressure-gauge they steer;
For who with steel can wheedle
As does the engineer,
In whose quick brain is hidden
The secrets of the stars,
The Yenus-words, love-bidden.
The thunder-blotVs of Mars?
He hears the steady murmur
Of engines in the gloom.
Could deck or floor be firmer
Than this, his engine-room?
And he whose touch the rudders
Respond to like a. child,
Calm, when she turns and shudders,
With silent mien, and mild —
He makes new pathways under
The breakers’ snarling lips ;
He mocks the big guns’ thunder
And scorns the battleships.

“The Besrsrar Girl’s Wedding,” celebrated
at the Adelphi on Thursday last, and
due for dissolution to-morrow evening,
would be less liable to cause dramatic
indigestion if a small note were at-
tached to the programme, containing cer-
tain evidence given by author Walter Mel-
ville in a recent lawsuit concerning this
bellowdrama and some alleged plagiarism.
Melville admitted that the play “contained
stock incidents and conventional characters,
and that it “was dictated in less than a
week,” and finally that his “only difficulty
was to find euphonious names for the charac-
ters.” The Bulletin doesn’t doubt his
word —or any of his words. But it seems a
bit hard on a “house” to ask it to pay os. or
so to hear Melville’s latest selection ot
“euphonious names,” especially as anyone
can hear a dozen better in any police court
any day. and hear them free of charge. As
a name for a villain “Gilbert Lindsay has
the advantage of being easily heroinised into
“You, Geelbut Linseee-ah !” But ‘Maud Vii-
liers,” Melville’s idea of a “euphonious
name” for a bad, bold woman, is a blank
cartridge. “Maudie” rather suggests a meek
typist, who wears her own complexion and
goes to church three times on Sunday.
Among the other characters there is none
likely to cause enthusiasm ; in fact, they sug-
gest that as a selector of “euphonious names
Melville has lost his punch. On Saturday
night “From Convent to Throne” will be
resurrected at Willoughby’s Sydney theatre.
Harry Lauder, professor of Scotch humor,
is due to start demonstrating at Sydney
Royal on Wednesday night, just when the
printer is driving this issue through the
mangle. Under the circumstances, the case
is adjourned for a week.
The writer, whose duty it is to chronicle
the fortunes, or otherwise, of whatever show
happens to be prospering—or bursting—at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney, finds himself this
week at a dead-end in the matter of re-
stating the obvious in more or less novel
terms. The limit has been attained. He is
up against it. Abandoning a struggle which
has been pluckily waged now for months, he
therefore remarks, quite baldly,_ that “The
Forty Thieves” pantomime continues to at-
tract vast crowds, and be a source of
joy and profit to the management, and a
credit to all concerned.

Allen Doone will close his Sydney season
at the Palace on Friday, and on Saturday
Dix and Baker, Ltd., will descend from
Newcastle and take possession of the house.
Ethel Buckley (so long a favorite at the
Adelphi) will do the rest with “Bess, of
Arizona.” It is announced of Bess that
“she’s a dead game sport; she never stops
to ask fool questions, but goes right in and
brings home the bacon.” Conjecture as to
what the play is all about may knock ofE
here and take it easv.
* * * *
“The Argyle Case” and Maggie Moore —or
is it Maggie Moore and “The Argyle Case”?
—continue to delight big audiences at the
Criterion (Sydney).
** * *
Miss Eileen Robinson, who made so prom-
ising a first appearance in “Fanny’s First
Play,” at Sydney’s Little Theatre, has made
her characterisation of “Darling Dora” more
even and consistent, and proves a valuable
recruit to the capable company commanded
by Hugh Buckler. This week will see the
last of Show’s delightful “pot-boiler.” for
on Monday “The School for Scandal” will
be presented.
The Sydney Tivoli finds very little time
these days to talk or think anything but
Ada Reeve, although now and again it sits
up and takes notice when anyone mentions
such names as Talleur Andrews, baritone;
Vivien Talleur and Fred Reade. tangoists;
Pussell Carr, ventriloquist: and Ed. E.
Ford, the rubber-faced freak. But it soon
dozes off and talks more Ada Reeve.
For variety of programme that of the
National Amphitheatre (Sydney) this week
would take on a pile of competition. It
includes a short playlet team, a couple of
bright whistlers, plain and fancy dancers,
balancers, a string of girl instrumentalists,
girl comedians, mere comedians, problematical
comedians, etc. comedians, iron-jawed men,
singers and alleged singeys, a brisk “cross
talk” pair and a few fragments. That lot of
entertainment is procurable for one shilling.
Roll up.
The only drawback to Sydney’s newest
fad, the Imperial Dancing Salon, where the
solemn freak sarabandists commingle, is that
it isn’t twice its present size. As it is,
almost as many people have to be turned
away as are admitted (at least, that was
the case on Saturday evening). The groans
of the directors of the tango temple were
something to be forgotten.
The tongue that Dionysius was wont to
show to the physicians ere he flew to cock-
tails for a cure will be heard in all its glory
at Melbourne Royal until further notice.
“Never Say Die” goes with a rush when
Niblo is around. Whilst he is talking against
time nobody can pause to think that hypo-
chondria and a rapid jocular utterance never
go together in the same young man, nor are
two eminent humbugs of the medical profes-
sion ever a pair of blitherers who lodge
joint and several protests against the re-
covery of a condemned patient. In “Never
Say Die” the thing that never was chases
the things that, never could be from situa-
tion to situation. If perchance anything
betrays symptoms of tiredness, Niblo comes
and lashes it with his furious tongue and
sets it going again. “Small jokes and quick
returns” is a maxim of American farcical
comedy. Likewise “Volubility is the soul
of wit,” and “Nothing in frivolous stage life
is half so funny as death.” The decease of
Dionysius—imminent or indefinitely post-
poned—-is the subject of all the merriment
in the “N.S.D.” performance. Drollery is
deeply imbued with ghoulery. Even the
countenance of Niblo is grave as a rule.
And when the overflowing audience is con-
vulsed with laughter, the present writer is
reminded of “The Milk White Flag” and the
diverting comedian of yore, who was cast
for the character of a corpse on ice.
Ministers of all denominations are cor-
dially invited to the Princess’s to see “The
Rosary” because the Yankee drama in ques-
tion is founded on an emblem of Purity and
is Worth While. A good many plays are
not worth tuppence, whilst a lot of others
are hardly worth mentioning, but the value
of “The Rosary” is stamped on the advt.
It is Worth While. It makes the common
or unconverted layman feel good, and en-
courages the clergy to feel better. The case
of the busted stockbroker who turneth away
from his worldliness at the instance of Father
Kelly is a cause for rejoicing all
round. If the penitent had been an iron-
monger or a soft-goodsman his conversion
would seem quite an ordinary occurrence,
for there are wowsers galore in both the
hardware and drapery trades. But a chas-
tened Wall-street speculator is an impressive
novelty. Perhaps the phenomenon is ex-
plained by his having taken to drink since
he “did in” his dollars. “Indeed, indeed, re-
pentance oft before I swore—but was I soher
when I swore?” asked Omar Khayyam.
“ THE BEGGAR GIRL’S WEDDING,"
AT THE SYDNEY ADELPHI.
George Cross demonstrates that the melodrama
hero carries a knockout punch in both hands.
At Her Majesty’s they are making
ready for the production of “Sealed
Orders” on Saturday. Sixteen scenes
are crowded into this latest importation
of Drury Lane drama, and its action ranges
from a fight in an airship to a dive into the
English Channel. So the theatre is closed
for two or three nights whilst the necessary
sea and sky and things are being prepared
for the thrills to come.
a*
The profusely musical act of the Elliott
Savonas, the somewhat-too-long comedy-
juggling of Field’s, and the Leopards and
the Lady are the most pretentious items in
the present Tivoli programme. The Two
Bobs are still pleasing their ragtime consti-
tuents, and the humor of the Farr and
Farland dualogue penetrates the dullest in-
tellects at a second time of hearing, whereas
the crudity of the Camerons disimproves on
acquaintance. The saddest of their vocal
efforts is reserved for an encore number, but
this uncalled-for .extra is less pathetic than
the pas de seul of the weightiest Cameron
who strikes the stage with his feet as though
he owed it a grudge. Gertrude Gebest
is the latest arrival. She sings a little and
tells yarns which are hardly strong enough
to raise a smile. Also she holds a dumb
fiddle to her shoulder and makes a noise like
a violin with her mouth. No violin would
be deceived by the imitation, nevertheless,
the effect isn’t displeasing. Many a violin
has done worse.
Ed. Ford , the Australian
sundowner , and a few
of his fantastic
faces, at the
Sydney Tivoli.
“The Face at the Window” is again
appearing at Melbourne King’s, and once
more the eerie howl of Le Loup is heard as
a portent of violence to follow. Also the
Iron Dagger leaves the usual sanguinary
evidence in the De Brisson drawing-room,
while the electrified corpse sits up as before
and writes down the doom of the awful
Delgado. A practically new cast figures in
this revival of the time-honored outrage, and
some fresh bits of scenery provide a com-
paratively picturesque setting for. the crim-
son carnival of the villain-in-chief. That
weird scoundrel is played by J. L. Lawrence,
who seems to trot about more than his pre-
decessors in the role, and at last achieves a
pedestrian triumph for the character. Les-
lie Woods, as Paul Gouffet, yields a poor
impression of the great detective who, dis-
guised by a cough and a broken arm, upsets
the home circle of the “Rogues’ Retreat.”
Edwin Campbell has a brief spell of loud-
ness as Henri de Brisson, the wealthy gent,
who gets Le Loup’s fatal weapon under his
skin, while Miss Wilton is the daughter who
prefers love and poverty to the dreary com-
forts of a motherless home. George Dawe
appears as Lucien Cortier, the beautiful
shrine at which the damsel worships ; while
Miss Isa Millett portrays La Pinan, a
female with the dregs of great beauty and
a voice like the creak of a long-locked door.
Temple Harrison and Miss Chetwynd hap-
pen as usual at unsuitable intervals, and the
conclusion of the show is further delayed
by the insertion of vaudeville artists, among
whom Miss Anna McNabb seems the most
uncalled for.

At Melbourne Bijou this week are Hyman
and Alton, comic acrobats; Woodward and
Page, trick bikists and dancers; Mounier
and Franz, the renowned strong men; and
Neil Cant, a Scawtch warbler who holds a
small, dim mirror up to Harry Lauder, and
also gives “My Hero” in a rich falsetto.
Gardner's Maniac Bulldogs, which arrived
on Saturday, demonstrate the power of their
jaws; and Delevale and Gilbert, the per-
sistent patterers. are more or less in the
same line of business.

“A Good Little Devil.” with pretty Mary
Pickford in the principal part, is mortgaging
the attention of West’s Melbourne supporters
this week. Also running are “Mack at it
Again,” a rather dull and tiresome comedy;
“The Tin Soldier and the Dolls,” a baby
melodrama in one spasm ; and “Scotland for
Ever,” a yarn wherein the confidence trick
is revealed and the kilts are mentioned with
approval.
Adelaide has been seeing its first of Harry
Lauder and its last of Julius Knight. Both
have done big business. Lauder, anticipated
by many imitators and countless gramo-
phones, shows himself a sound actor, with
an unexpectedly good singing voice, and a
touch of the blarney of another nation. But
he tends now to over-elaborate all his effects.
Also the programme is ill-arranged. If he
sang twice during the evening, he would
have the crowd refusing to part with him.
As it is, he gives the whole latter part of
the programme. One gets too weary to
appreciate him ; hence people are seen leav-
ing to catch trams and trains just as the
star is getting in his strongest personal
appeal. Knight, at the Royal, has had what
he himself called a “wonderful” season,
even though all four pieces were revivals.
Irene Browne, with all her strange manner-
isms, has great charm, and the supporting
co. is strong. Knight ended with “Man
and Superman,” in which, as usual, he
discards the beard that Shaw has decreed
for John Tanner. There was great en-
thusiasm at the end. Adelaide is sorry to
lose the man who has given it a long series
of spectacular or educational successes; and
he seemed sorry to go.
Other Adelaide shows are well diversified.
At the Royal, the “Aladdin” pantomime has
come in, “joy-plank,” wrestling ponies, and
all. At the Tivoli, Winifred Ward, just
from England, calls herself the Immaculate
Boy—a jolly little chap, full of fun and go,
and looking more like a boy than usual,
always excepting the time when she wears
kilts. There is a strong mixed bill at the
King’s, with the juggling Normans at its
head. The Lee-Chandler girls are nearly
as gingerous as they claim to be, and Billie
Lee continues to do unlikely things with a
stockwhip. Among the films. “The Miracle.”
at West’s, is the bffi outstanding feature.
But why has nobody sufficiently admired the
nerve of the management in the method of
booming it? It is the old. cynical Middle
Ages yarn of the girl who passed to one
owner after another, and yet was finally
accepted as being Correct; grafted on to it
is the still more cynical legend of Divine
assistance, even to 'he extent of a miracle,
granted to screen ."-•<1 protect what is—as in
Davidson’s beautiful, abominable poem—
sheer animal enjoyment. And yet it is all
somehow passed off for a valuable moral
lesson!
The widows of two remarkable men died
recently—Mrs. lluxley and Mrs. Ibsen. The
former, who was 89 when she died, was in
Sydney for several years. She was Miss
Henrietta Anne Heathorn. who met the great
scientist when he visited Sydney in the
Rattlesnake in 1847, as navy surgeon. Ilex-
sister was the wife of a Sydney merchant
named Fanning; her father had a brewery-
on the South Coast. Huxley and his wife
“courted” for eight years before marriage—
by letter mainly, as he left Sydney in 1848,
and the two did not meet again for five
years. Ibsen’s widow was 77.
One of Adela Pankhurst’s charges against
the English journals is that they have openly
suggested a policy of brutal retaliation by
the public against the poor suffragettes. “It
looks as though the ‘public’ has begun to act
on this advice,” said indignant Adela to her
symnathetic Melbourne audience. “A mob
of Birmingham students forced their way
into the offices of the Suffrage League and
smashed the furniture and pictures—de-
stroyed everything in the place.” (Cries
of “.Shame!”) She was carefully ignoring
the immediate cause of this vengeful van-
dalism. The suffragettes had previously-
burned a cricket pavilion and a racecourse
grandstand, and had play-ed mischief with
the golf links at Birmingham. They made
war on sport, and sport carried the war
into the enemy’s camp.
The High Court has had another wrestle
■with the thorny subject of compulsory pilot-
age. The Australian Governments received
with great glee the decision in a recent case
that a State was not liable for any damage
done to a vessel while in charge of a Gov-
ernment pilot, though it was compulsory on
the part of the shipowner to employ such
pilot. This decision cuts both ways. _ A
pilot was dodging into Townsville (Q.) with
the big liner Banffshire, when that argosy-
blundered into the breakwater and punc-
tured the edifice or cupola. The Townsville
Harbor Board thereupon sued the owners of
the steamer for damaging its breakwater.
The owners, of course, argued that if the
State of Queensland wasn’t liable for any
damage done to a vessel with its pilot
aboard, then additionally the vessel _ wasn’t
liable for what it did while under his com-
pulsory care. The High Court was unani-
mous that this view was correct, and pre-
sented the bill of costs to the Harbor Board.
Then the Harbor Boai-d said “damn” fre-
quently.

“D” : It seems to me that many Of the lines in
“The Argyle Case” could be cut with advantage to
the players. There are times, in this play, when the
acting interferes seriously with the smoking.
The Fraser Film Release Co. has come to an
arrangement with .1. C. Williamson, Ltd., whereby
the picture firm’s local production of “Ihe Silence
of Dean Maitland” will be screened at the Criterion
Theatre on June 9. Admission to the show will be
by invitation, and it is understood that negotiations
are in progress between the two firms for the further-
ance of the recently announced intention of J.C.vy.
Ltd. to turn one or two of its Sydney theatres into
afternoon picture-show places.
“O.lv.”: Melbourne seems to have fallen on evil
days as regards ventures in amateur musical show's.
I’rett.y girls such as decorated the chorus of the Lyric
Operatic Society in days of yore are now enlisted foi
the professional stage, or they keep off the stage
altogether. So the glory of Melbourne s amateur
showmanship has departed. It biased out for the
last time in “Lelainine,” at the Princess s, 17 years
ago, and all subsequent displays have been of dimin-
ished brightness. “Lelamine” was the military
comic opera” for which Alfred Moulton had tried to
get a hearing, and at last his dream was realised
for him bv his friend, young Gordon Carter, at that
time hon. sec. of the Savage Club. Carter, who had
been managing the Palmer-Beaumont Concert Co., arm
was full of plans for organising a show on sassiety
lines, offered his suggestions to Moulton, and then
proceeded to put them into practice. He captured
the Guv’ment House interest by proposing the Lari oi
Shaftesbury as an ideal person for the heroic tenor
part in “Lelamine.” He got the offer of the theatre
for a week, and the loan of unlimited dresses tiom
the Williamson wardrobe. The pick of the amateurs
for principals, chorus and ballet was obtained per
medium of McNicol Turner, who had been a leading
spirit of the high-toned Lyric Society before .it dis-
banded. Gordon Carter had nothing to do with the
stage and orchestra work when the production was
put fairly in hand; Moulton and Johnny Wallace
attended to that part of the entertainment. But all
the cares of the managerial campaign —the boosting,
conciliating and directing—fell to the tactician who
was billed merely as secretary (unpaid). “Lelamine
ran its appointed week to full houses, and Moultons
head swelled alarmingly. A year later he joined
forces with another Savage Clubite, one Henry tem-
ple, in the production of “The American Girl,’ at the
same theatre. Moulton was composer and 1 emple did
the libretto. They had a professional co. and a dis-
astrous failure.
“Stargazer” : The Yank’s contempt for an English-
man’s sense of humor is widely advertised in ‘ Nevei
Say Die,” largely the product of American comedian
Collier, who has made much hay in the sunshine of
his English successes. It seems to me the Yank attains
the sublimity of his grand audacity when he squeals
derision at British wit. I suppose the test of a
nation’s humor is in its literature. If so, how does
Yankeeland’s output, with its Mark Twains (many
and not various), its Bill Nyes, its George Ades, and
the like mechanical mirth-makers compare with
Britain’s product in the last two generations? Is
there in all the American burlesques produced in 50
years as much true fun as there is in “The Mikado”
or “Patience”? How many American comedies would
it take to yield as much wit as there is in one act
of “The Woman of No Importance”? Put “Never
Say Die,” littered as it is with extraneous jokelets
such as you find in the collected funny column of the
average dull weekly, into comparison with a farcical
comedy like “The Amazons,” and where is it? It is
in the dustbin. The cheekiest thing of all in the
Collier comedy is the act of using good old English
jokes, faked into American shape, to illustrate the
contention that the English can’t see a joke till a
week after first meeting it.
“Monkbarns”: Niblo’s “Never Say Die” is sug-
gested by Boucicault’s “Prima Donna,” produced in
London by Chas. Kean, with Australia’s old friend
Cathcart, Lacy, Caroline Heath (afterwards Mrs.
Wilson Barrett) and Agnes Robertson (afterwards
Mrs. Boucicanlt) in the cast. Eva, the prima donna,
is in love with a count, for whom she throws over
Rouble, a stockbroker. Her younger and prettier
sister, Trixie, is dying, but imagines that the count
comes after her. Eva and the count humor the poor
thing. But Trixy gets well! The count has to
marry her, and Eva falls back on the old glove
Rouble.
Tom Craven, English dramatist and comedian, is
in Sydney, renewing acquaintance with old friends
of his late father, Mr. H. T. Craven, who was well
known in the city 50 years ago. H.T. was at one
time lessee of the old Queen’s Theatre in Yorlc-street,
which he rechristened “Our Lyceum.”
“O.KJ”: Ada Reeve’s turn at Melbourne Tivoli sets
you thinking of how much theatrical art is needed
to make a poor song go at all, and how a good song
needs only a simply intelligent utterance to make it
go a long way. The melodies that Ada deals with are,
with one exception, mawkishly sentimental or con-
ventionally saucy ; yet her acting carries them along
triumphantly. The artist makes the successes. But
one song, “When Richard the First Sat on the
Throne,” is a humorously written set of verses that
requires only a quick, clean enunciation of the lines
in accordance with the tune, like the comedian’s
patter songs in Gilbertian opera. Weston Pitt has
been singing “Richard the First” in Melbourne for
years. He wears a dress suit, stands stock still and
throws out the words unsmilingly. They get there
every time. At a Savage Club smoke-night, or as an
item in a theatre show, or in a concert at the Audi-
torium, the humor of “Richard the First” always
wins. Pretty Esther Patterson, who occasionally con-
tributes drawings of heavenly flappers to The Bulle-
tin, will sit before a piano and make the pungent
patter-ditty pay 20s. in the £ without attempting
to be funny on her own account. But Ada ReeVe
brings her own artistry' t 6 bear upon the simple little
thing, with the result that half the humor is crushed
out of it. She is all over the stage. She gesticu-
lates, she emphasises, she suits unnecessary action to
the word or introduces action which is not worded
at all.
The latest instalment of the reminiscences
of veteran actor Barnes, in London Stage, tells how
he and Julius Knight toured the U.S. with Joe
Jefferson, of “Rip Van Winkle” renown. They met,
on this trip, the most illiterate theatrical magnate on
record. He (the magnate) strolled into one of his
many theatres while a rehearsal of the “Passion
Play” was in progress. “Who are them chaps?”
he inquired, pointing to a bevv of whiskered supers.
“They are the twelve apostles,” he was told.
“Twelve,” he exclaimed. “What’s the good of 12
on a big stage like that ? Put 50 apostles on the
job.”
AVhen the Hebrew Hod-Carriers’ Union feels that
it is getting overcrowded, to the jeopardy of the
pay of the Jew for hod-carrying, it limits the appren-
tices, or abolishes them altogether, or fixes the
admission fee to the e/aft at an impossible £lO. But
these methods are clumsy compared with the bright
idea which has struck the German Actors’ Benevolent
Association of Berlin. It is offering a prize of
£l5O for the best novel “depicting the unadorned
truth of life on the stage.” Intending competitors
must show parents and susceptible young people the
trials and tribulations of a theatrical career in their
real colors, “divested of the seductive romance which
makes boys and girls stage-struck, and is overcrowd-
ing the profession, to the moral and economic detri-
ment of all concerned.”

“0.K.” : The late W. H. C. Nation, who rented Lon-
don theatres and engaged companies, from time to
time, for the pleasure of having his own plays acted,
escaped a heavy loss on at least one of his produc-
tions. When he was a young man he rented Sadler s
Wells and produced “The Golden Dustman,” a dramas
tisation of Dickens’s “Our Mutual Friend,”, with a
fairly strong cast. Silas Wegg, the wooden-legged
humbug, was played by George Belmore, father of
the Daisy Belmore who came to Australia with Wil-
son Barrett’s first co., and married one of Albert
Whelan’s brothers, Waxman. There were other
popular mummers in the cast, and the “Dustman ran
for some time. Subsequently, W. H. C. Nation
became a fixed ioke in the profession. One of the
Cockney humorists of long ago always referred to
him as O.U.R.A. Notion.
There is bitter contempt of British “public opinion”
in Galsworthy’s new play, “The Mob” —given its first
run at Manchester, which has a much better reputa-
tion than London for encouraging the Higher Drama.
He imagines all England yelling for war on some
small nation. The politician-hero of the play is the
only pro-Boer (so to speak) in sight. He loses his
office, his seat, his friends and pretty nearly his wife ;
and the war goes on. There comes the usual “Mafe-
king night,” and a crowd thinks it a good chance to
“rag” his home and him. Still he talks straight talk,
and at last a frenzied girl, whose lover has been
killed in the war, stabs him fatally. After this, the
inevitable reaction, and the public which had stoned
him puts up a statue to his memory, with the inscrip-
tion, “Faithful to His Ideal.” It is altogether too
near the truth to be a success on the regular stage.
Which of Australia’s Repertory theatres will be the
first to get it?
The mailbag disgorged this at one of Sydney’s
theatres the other day addressed to the manager:
“Sir, you promies mason a pars. When you sent

“H.S.”: From Sydney Grundy’s booklet The Play
nf the Future”: “Incense enough and to spare has
been burnt at this unhallowed shrine” ( ht ' ls rf ' e, ™|
to Oscar Wilde). “When the whiteness of leprosyjs
extolled as the purity of snow patience is exhausted
Azariah was a leper unto the day of his death , a
the vlaoue of leprosy is in his garments, m the warp
and in the woof.” How well it expresses what most
normal people have felt while reading Wilde!
“Dorian P Gray” is an extraordinarily clever book.
There is no part of it that the veriest wowser cou d
pick out for criticism on moral grounds. Bu j- 1
the mass it nauseates. There is ovev it a thick a mo-
sphere which suggests painted young men. and 1 -
cense-laden flats, and white male hands heavily be-
ringed. The same atmosphere pervades eveiy one of
Wilde’s modern plays. One marvels at their wit and
character-sense and ppetry, yet through all there seem
to peer the heavy, womanish face of the psycopath
who P wrote them. Grundy speaks truly Wilde’s work
is leprous; and it is the more deeply infected by
reason of his strength of personality and genius.
The musical Kennedy family, which is making its
first tour of Maoriland (the party, setting out from
Sydney, has wandered over most of the earth, and
only got its long-range telescope on to the Loanly
Isles a few months ago), writes a joy-letter about
the treat, judging by the cash receipts, press criti-
cisms and social halleluiah, it is giving the inhabi-
tants A purely musical show that can run to good

tainly have hit the said inhabitants in a hitherto-

The old Coogee (N.S.W.) Aquarium, which has
known no fish except the tinned variety for very
many years, was sold last week for £7000. The
vacant land alongside it and overlooking the ocean
beach was auctioned previously for as much as £40
a foot. Presumably the whole place will be trans-
mogrified and an ancient shrine converted into some-
body’s backyard. For years it proudly bore a plate
alleging that “on this spot Deeming proposed ’ to

Sydney D.T. provided the headline of
last week —“Stonewall Ends Fruitlessly.”
So once more the truth is driven home that
it is impossible to get fruit out of a stone,
and that one Cook of the right variety is
quite able to spoil the haggis. Still the D.T.
can rest assured that Andrew Fisher will
leave no stonewall unturned in his struggle
to climb to the bananas of office.
At a recent meeting of the Southland
(M.L.) Hospital and Charitable Aid Board
a Gore (M.L.) doctor urged that special
accommodation should be provided at the
local hospital for delirium tremens cases.
Gore is part of a wide no-license dis-
trict, hence the doctor’s application—at
least, that’s how one of the members of the-
Board put it. Well, they had snakes even in
the Garden of Eden.
In the Representatives, during the. discus-
sion on Iceberg Irvine’s Bill to abolish pre-
ference to unionists in the Commonwealth
services: —• , A „ , .
Andrew Fisher: If individuals are not allowed to
associate in an organisation they are undoubtedly
placed at a disadvantage.
W. H. Irvine : Hear, hear! No one has disputed
that.
There you have the inwardness of it in a
sentence.
The futility of Prime Minister Cook, as
set out in the Representatives a few days
ago by
Mr. Joseph Cook: Before the Minister proceeds
will you permit me, Mr. Speaker, to ask you a ques-
tion? I ask you very seriously and earnestly if you
can show me any way of expediting the business of
this country. It is now noon, and we have not com-
menced the business of the day. I am making an
appeal. I ask if you know of any Standing Order or
any way whatever whereby we can control the busi-
ness of the House. I cannot control it.... It is part
of the Speaker’s functions to facilitate the business
of the House, and as I can do nothing, as I am help-
less, I am appealing to you, sir.
Even the docile Johnson stood on his hind
legs. “The Government,” he retorted, “is in
charge of the House. The Speaker is con-
cerned only with seeing that the Standing
Orders are carried out and the proceedings
conducted in conformity with them.” Where-
unon the whimpering atom dropped to heel.
“ J.R.” : As a class, parsons are perhaps
more ignorant of history than any, other;
and when the average parson talks politics
he is a veritable marvel of futility. . Why ?
Perhaps because the orthodox cleric is a
man of indifferent intelligence to begin with,
and because, in addition, he presently has
most of his critical sense dogmatised out
of him by his training. A prize bit of fool-
ishness was the effort of one of the ministers
at a recent sitting of the General Assembly
of the Presbyterians in Sydney. Said he: —
What was the state of Ireland under self-govern-
ment when Grattan’s Parliament held sway? It had
at all times been a corrupt Assembly, and was never
truly representative of the Irish nation.
As though this were the merest apology for
an argument against genuine Irish self-
government. The Irish Parliament certainly
was corrupt, but the reason was that it sat
during the 18th century, when nearly every
politician was corrupt, and when members
of the British House of Commons freely paid
for offices of profit and pensions “on the
Irish establishment.” Grattan’s Parlia-
ment did not represent the Irish nation,
for the very good reason that none but
Protestants could be elected to sit in it, and
very few but Protestants could comply with
the'tests imposed on voters. It represented
about the same proportion of the population
as a N.S.W. Assembly would represent
locally if it consisted exclusively of squatters
elected by people with incomes of not less
than £lOOO per annum.
“If the Empire understood the full signi-
ficance of the Australian experiment, prayers
would continually be in process of being
offered up in the churches for its success.
General lan Hamilton, in his report to the
Commonwealth Government on the compul-
sory-training-for-defence scheme.
Northmore, Westralia’s new Supreme
Court Judge, is the only non-imported man
on that Bench, and the first real Australian
to sit there for many a year. He comes of
an old South Aus. family, and took his law
degree in Adelaide University over 20 years
ago. Most of his legal practice has been
done in Perth, where he arrived shortly after
qualifying for the Bar.
A syndicate of medical men who are tired
of paying high rents are promising to build
a tower of rooms for themselves in Collins-
street, where the brass plate blinks upon
the front fence,, and the patient from the
suburbs transpires. Most of the Collins-
street doctors’ houses date from the early
days when architects hated fresh air and
light, so the nervous patient has to be inter-
viewed in a room which reminds him of the
waiting tomb. The new co-operative _ pre-
mises are to rear a proud red brick front,
and will contain plenty of bright waiting-
rooms where the sick person can be en-
couraged. There will also be a fountain 01
two, singing birds, bright young attendants
and a supply of modern literature. It
sounds too cheerful to be professional; but.
after all, why should the medicine man of
the tribe be surrounded by gloom and silence
as if he were the doorkeeper of Death ? Per-
haps we may yet have our little pains and
aches diagnosed and prescribed for at tango
teas.
A five-line cable has conveyed the news
that a small, leaky cargo steamer turned
turtle in the English Channel and drowned
13 of its crew. Of course the disaster would
not have been so baldly described had the
unlucky 13 been passengers; but British
sailors —almost anything can be a British
sailor now —are very cheap and can be used
anyhow. A writer in the British Review
for April speaks bitterly on the subject: —
It is no uncommon sight to see vessels leaving dock
for sea with decks piled high with coal, hatches ou
and booms aloft, to face a gale with a crew sodden
with drink or unable to understand English, ami
the officers tired out with overwork. Others may be seen
wallowing along like timber yards, agricultuial
machine factories, or banana plantations adrift, while
scores of others have a greater resemblance to half-
tide rocks and dirigible balloons than to ships, the
helpless victims of overloading and underloading.
And, curiously enough, it was the humane
blit inexperienced Lloyd George who, as
President of the Board of Trade, raised the
Plimsoll load line a trifle, and thus made
the sailor’s life more dangerous and horrible
than it had been before. Australia, with its
wretched dredge importations, has also,
helped to drown a few of the fo’c’s’le hands,
who had foolishly clung to their wet _ jobs
instead of going ashore and getting billets
as vergers or gardeners.
Darlinghurst Gaol (Sydney) will cease to
exist on June 30 next, when the few remain-
ing unpaying guests will be transferred to the
new prison at Long Bay. Whether it is
that N. S. Wales is more law-abiding
than it is credited with being by
Archbishop Kelly and Rev. Yarrington,
or the traps can’t catch enough crim-
inals, or amended regulations of the
Crooks’ Union have restricted the gaol space
that may be filled by its members, is not
clear; but the fact obtrudes that the Cooma
and Glen Innes gaols are absolutely empty,
while it has been found impossible to send
enough lodgers to the other establishments
to keep them all going. The old gaol at
Darlinghurst, famous as the place of execu-
tion of condemned criminals for many a year,
is to be turned into a High School for Girls.
This will release the valuable block of laud
running from Elizabeth-street to Castlereagli-
street, near King-street (city), on which
stand barracks built by convicts in the dubi-
ous old days, and for years past used as a
“finishing” place for the Very Best flappers.
“Wunanthree”: General lan Hamilton
calls attention in his report to “the need for
re-organisation in the Ordnance Branch of
the Defence Department.” What does he
know about it? Organisation is, as a matter
of fact, the overwhelmingly strong suit of the
officer in charge of this branch. His system
has been one of the 14 wonders of the local
military world for months. Take this effort
of his, which is now prominently displayed
in the corridors of the old bluestone building
in St. Kilda Road: —
1. Each person employed in any office of this
Department is to keep books, papers, etc., in proper
and correct order.
2. Before leaving the office each day steps are to
be taken to put all such things in their proper places,
and no papers, books, etc., are to be kept on desks
or tables.
3. Any papers, books, etc., left on the tables or
desks of the person using such table or desk or
shelves- in close proximity to such person will be
deemed to be in the place of that person, and lie
will be held responsible for same if not kept in
proper order as above.
4. Anyone found leaving books, papers, etc., in
disorder will be called upon for an explanation., and
reports will be forwarded to Head Office in conse-
quence. ,
5. Waste-paper baskets are to be used for all waste
matter.
6. For the benefit of all persons alike, it will be
noted that if all things are kept in proper order and
regularly placed and in sequence by all concerned,
the keeping of all things will be easier for everyone,
and there will be no need for calling attention to
irregular matters from time to time.
Had Hamilton seen the above, his report
would doubtless have worn a very different
complexion. It bears the broad-visioned
master-touch that appeals to all those who
really know.
BALLADE OF THE NEW DRAMATIC CRITIC.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mine is the foremost central stall—
These days you’ll find me everywhere,
In town and suburbs one and all,
And know me by my easy air
And optic glass and steady stare,
Without the ancient critic’s pose.
My style is light and debonair
I’m Critic of the Picture Shows.
The plots are new, original.
The mine explodes, the airships tear,
Big icebergs on the South Pole fall,
And well-trained bugs pyjamas wear.
And Aste’s great, I do declare,
Ten thousand yards of thrilling woes —
Give me the film, the Ham, the flare,
I’m Critic of the Picture Shows.
1 visit theatres great and small,
Where lurid posters gleam and glare.
And gramophones though trumpets bawl,
To hunt the great advt. to his lair.
The drama is my pride and care,
Not morbid plays in verse or prose.
The flickering film is my affair —
I’m Critic of the Picture Shows.
Envoi.

And even curse; but well he knows
Nursegirl and butcher-boy can’t spare

The alarums of the P. and O. Co. caused
by the threatened amalgamation with this
and that steamship line —alarums which
during the last couple of years have led to
fierce gambles in the shares of the former —
have crystallised into an official announce-
ment that the P. and O. and the British
India have linked forces. Whether the new
co. will be called the P. 8.1.0. or the
8.1.P.0. isn’t yet stated. The arrangement
to combine has been hastened by the hostile
attitude taken up towards British shipping
by the combination of the Norddeutcher
Lloyd and the Hamburg-America, the two
German shipping giants who have pursued
the P. and O. into the Australian and Asia-
tic trades. The 8.1. Co. has a bigger footing
in the Indian trade than the P. and 0., and
.the two combined will have tremendous
resources behind them.
A KNOCK-OUT.
BIG BILL: "P'raps yer don’t know, but I was a champion ’ eavyweight in my time, an’

SHRILL VOICE FROM BEHIND: “You come ome this minnit or I'll dashed well make yer.”
In view of the howl about the cost of
Defence, why waste so much powder and
time and good gun material in firing so
many so-called Royal salutes? During May
and June there either have been or are to
be five of these meaningless outbreaks of
expensive noise. Most of the forts that will
be responsible for them are so isolated that
few people will hear them; and most of
those who do hear them will conclude that
somebody is blasting out foundations.
Already this month there have been various
bangs on account of Accession Day and
Empire Day, and within the next month
Mary is to be “honored” by a row that cer-
tainly won’t do her any good and possibly
may do many other Marys harm; and
George, having grown a year older, is to be
reminded of it by a noise which he can’t
possibly hear; and a racket is to be made
on Coronation Day to remind us that George
is king, though everybody knows it quite
well already. If Bruce Smith likes to tear
round and make speeches on Empire Day it
doesn’t matter very much so long as the
country doesn’t have to pay the cab-fare;
and he may even accidentally say something
worth listening to. But nobody can pretend
that the noisy explosion of a few blank
cartridges gives George or Mary or the
late Victoria or the Empiali or Bill Adams
any sort of profit at all. And if it gives
nobody any profit and costs money that we
can’t afford to waste, where’s the sense in
it?

Though things are not as bad as in super-
congested Sydney, house-room is becoming
very scarce in Melbourne, and the new-chum
family turns naturally to the old-world de-
vice of whacking quarters with one or two or
a hundred other families. In a country
with millions of unoccupied acres it is a
vile system, which needs to be vigorously
suppressed.
A down-south Court the other day had to
tackle the tough job of estimating the cash
value of a wife. It was in connection with
a suit for divorce, and the petitioner
claimed that the other gentleman should
pay £5OO for the lady in the case. The
claim put the other gentleman in an awk-
ward position. On the one hand no lady
likes to be told by the gentleman of her
choice that- —lock, stock and barrel —she
isn’t worth £500; on the other hand, £5OO
is £5OO, and £5OO takes some saving with
mutton chops at Bd. a pound. Apparently
the mutton-chop consideration gained the
day, for the gentleman resisted the claim;
and then the matter was thrown to the
judgment of the Court, and the Court’s
troubles started. On the one hand, how
could it give a man £5OO for goods that he
said he was better without and was fighting
hard to get rid of? On the other hand, while
thousands of ladies can’t get any gentleman
to want them, how could it _ decide
that a lady for whom there had evidently
been competition was_ worth nothing?
By what rule of arithmetic the Court got an
answer to the sum The Bulletin doesn’t
know; all it knows is that the answer was
£75. What the lady has to say about the
figure hasn’t been disclosed.
The Lithgow (N.S.W.) gravedigger has
just put in for a rise in screw, his contention
being that the local health is so disgust-
ingly robust that his business is at a stand-
still. _lf he can’t get work he is at least
determined that he will have money. The
case is incidentally an argument in favor of
cremation. The spectacle of a half-starved
sexton, glowering hungrily at a community
which stands between him and the nourish-
ment he needs, is horrible, and should be
abolished.

able to repose as it does in these days of
tear and hurry. Some time ago it turned
drowsily and mentioned, in a slumbersome
sort of way, that the villa builder should
no longer be allowed to contaminate the
fringes of Port Phillip with fences, walls,
dead fish, piles of bananas or other impedi-
menta. But at that stage exhaustion'and
utter boredom and an overwhelming feeling
of tiredness overcame it, and it fell back into
its armchair and has hardly stirred since,
So much so, indeed, that Private Enterprise
has rushed up “beach frontage” villas every-
where, with fences that extend to low-water
mark and past. And P.E. is still at it.
Next summer the protesting howl of the
surf-bather and the beach picnicker will
shiver the welkin into a thousand of pieces,
But, by then, a theory will arise that the
man who stole the edge of the water has a
sort of title by possession, just as if he had
embezzled a cathedral or an Alp.

. The fulminations of Key. Yarrington and
his colleagues, are beginning to bear iu.
In a recent issue of London Times the fol-
lowing appeared . .
The Archdeacon of Richmond, speaking yesterday
at the annual meeting of a rescue home in Leeds,
said that a pantomime performer had informed him
that he had been in San Francisco and in Sydney,
but Leeds he found to be the most terrible and the
most impudently vicious place in the world.
So the prizes for horror were allotted thus:
(1) Leeds; (2) Sydney; (3) San Fran-
cisco. Canton, London and Tangier also
ran. • Chicago was scratched owing to lame-
ness.
A Government can’t get much glory out
of a new coat of paint on a school-building,
or even from stuffing up the holes in the
roof. The miserable youngsters who get
the rain-drops down their backs and can’t
use the lavatory because it is in a state of
violent disrepair haven’t got votes, and they
have to stay home at nights and do three
sums and a page of grammar instead of
going out and howling hosannas in front
of a Minister who has come round with
another sackful of promises. Nevertheless,
if N. S. Wales had contracted the habit of
making fine speeches and presenting the
Minister with a miniature silver paint-
brush whenever a coat of white-lead was
put on a dilapidated State building, the
chances are that the Annandale (Sydney)
sanitary inspector wouldn’t have had to re-
port of the big local school fhat “the roofing
and guttering were defective, and the interior
walls showed extensive evidence of damp-
ness,” or that the windows couldn’t any
longer be opened, and were, therefore, no
use for ventilation, or that the lavatory
accommodation was unfit, and the out-
houses “filthy, indecent and positively
dangerous.” N. S. Wales still derives about
a million a year from the sale of public
land, and the Labor party used to say that it
was a scandal to manipulate this, as ordinary
revenue, and that at the worst the money
should be used to maintain public buildings.
But the alleged Labor Government is so des-
perately busy placating little Jim’s father
with an extra shilling a day that, even if it
could spare the time, it seemingly can’t spare
any of the million to attend to voteless little
Jim’s filthy, indecent and positively danger-
ous outhouse accommodation.

A local brewer, giving evidence before
Judge Docker and the Reduction Court, at
Lithgow (N.S.W.), said that a pint of beer
was not a drink —it was only a start. It took
five pints to moisten a coalminer or
a blast-furnace worker. It recalls the
North Country English cricketer who
went into Dan Tierney’s Currency
Lass Hotel, in Sydney, and asked if
they had any Australian beer. They had.
He called for a pint, swallowed it, and w r as
in doubt. After trying another he decided
it was good, and said he would have a drink
of it.
SONG OF JUBILANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The retail price of kerosene is reduced by 3d.
per tin from to-day. For this the community
lias to thank the Age. —Melbourne Age.
Lo, a Fall has just transpired whose effects on
human-kind
Far outstrip the Bourbon and Napoleonic Falls
combined ;
From his Hundred-Days of bluster and his deeds of
derring-do
Limps the mortified retailer who has met his Water-
loo.
Freedom shrieked when Kosciusko fell a century ago.
Caesar’s Fall occasioned comment. Wolsey’s was a
bitter blow
To his friends in Rome and England. France was
shocked when Paris fell
And the loathly German legions surged within and
started hell.
Adam’s Fall was epoch-making. And the world-wide
Slump in Beer
(Which occurred in ’97) made the brewers gasp
with fear.
Yet these Falls were simply piffling, by comparison
with that
Which the Age achieved one Thursday off its own
triumphant bat.
From to-day the Cost of Living must assume a
walking pace ;
And there’s joy and jubilation stamped on each
consumer’s face ;
You can smell the vast advantage from the ram-
parts of the fort
(Though it’s not, perhaps, apparent in the modest
pint or quart) ;
And the dawn of the Millennium’s closer than it’s
ever been,
Since the Age tore off a thrummer from the price
of kerosene.

PURIFIED PETROLEUM AS A HEALING
REMEDY FOR DIGESTIVE DISORDERS.
The value of purified petroleum as a healing
remedy for dgestive and bowel disorders is
now universally recognised. Unlike animal
or vegetable oils, petroleum passes through
the stomach unchanged, hence its soothing,
lubricating, disinfectant action is exercised
throughout the entire alimentary tract. To
obtain the best results from petroleum, it
should be adminis ered in the form of an
emulsion. In this form, the petroleum is
broken up into minute globules which mingle
freely with the contents of the stomach
and are thus evenly distributed throughout
the digestive area, where the r soothing,
healing powers are exerted to the fullest
extent.
The original and standard preparation of
petroleum for internal use is Angier’s Emul-
sion, which has been largely employed by the
medical profession ever since 1892. The
petroleum in Angier’s Emulsion is purified by
a special process and combined with the
hypophosphites of lime and soda in the form
of a perfect Emulsion that is pleasant to the
palate and acceptable to the most delicate
stomach.
Apart from its soothing, healing properties
Angier’s Emulsion (because of the hypo-
phosphites which it contains) exerts a marked
tonic, invigorating influence, which makes it
of value in a wide variety of disorders. The
medical profession prescribe it extensively not
only for lung troubles and wasting diseases,
but even more largely for gastric catarrh,
gastric ulcer, mucous colitis, nervous dys-
pepsia, chronic constipation and in many
obscure digestive and bowel disorders. Of all
chemists at 1/3, 2/9 and 4/6.

The Overseas Club, which appeared likely
to settle' down in Melbourne into a harmless
social refuge where the new-clium lamb and
the native-born lion could sit together,
is now confronted with a rival organisation
invented by one A. N. Bishop. This obtru-
sive young man fell out of the original con-
cern through over-reaching himself, and then
he started what he calls “the English branch
of the Overseas Club,” designed to capture
new arrivals as soon as they come ashore.
It has no club rooms, and the parent club in
London has repudiated its claim to call
itself “Overseas” ; but still its irrepressible
"secretary” continues to keep himself and
his organisation in the limelight. He seized
the Hempire Day opportunity to get permis-
sion from the Anglican Archbish. of Mel-
bourne to take charge of the Union Jack
service at the Cathedral. After which he
invited the Gaud Mayor and others to be
present. But the bona-fide Overseas Club
got wind of what the bogus “branch” man-
ager was doing, and promptly blew him out.
After that the Anglican Archbishop wrote to
this other arch-Bishop and “told him what he
thought of him” ; and when a Church digni-
tary tells a pushful layman what he thinks
of him, the culprit is expected to go away
and hide his blush. But A. N. Bishop will
not blush, or go away. He is not one of
the retiring sort.
THE BEARER OF BURDENS.
PLAIN BILL : “Well, I don't know there's anything more the new woman can shove
upon the old man now that she's imposed upon him the penalty of child-bearing.”
The south-east corner at the intersection
of Swanston and Collins streets, Melbourne,
purchased in 1837 by Dr. Thomas Black
then of Penrith (N.S.W.), for £lBO, has
changed hands at £05,000. Dr. Black let the
corner on a building lease in 1883, for £3OOO
a year.
The age of romance is quite dead. A
Burra (S.A.) man, who fancied that it
isn’t, sent his loathed employer a letter with
these stirring sentiments :
I now demand you to fight a duel with me, having
nothing now to live on, and being brought down in
honor of name through a scoundrel like y0u....
Jr this does not satisfy you, I will find you, but will
not act the miserable coward towards you like you
have done, but will give you full satisfaction in
choice of weapons; I do not care which, but will
meet you under any conditions so long as it is to
the finish.
The unromantic enemy, instead of nominat-
ing soda-water syphons, or axes at 80 paces,
asked a police-court to protect him from
“grievous bodily injury.” The Bench said
in a shocked voice that it amounted in
effect to a threat of murder, and gave the
challenger a sporting choice between six
months’ gaol and a bond to keep the peace
for that time. He chose Peace. He evefi
apologised. Romance is down and out. Oh
for the grand old times, when Moses threw
10 plagues and a whole Red Sea at Pharaoh,
and the days when Samson slew a Philistine
with the jawbones of 1000 asses !
The Women’s Political Ass., whereof Vida
Goldstein is high priestess, pleads a sweetly
parsonic excuse for taking up a collection
when Adela Panlchurst gives an address on
Suffragettery, The audience having paid
for its seats is desired to kindly remember
the offertory dishes at the doors —“not that
women are beggars,” as Adela remarks to
the congregation, “but in order that every-
body may enjoy the privilege of assisting
the Cause.” A curate producing a morality
play in aid of the new Sunday-school build-
ing would put the matter in just the same
way. It makes the Cause seem quite holy.
“S’Blud”: The aldermen who are advocat-
ing the destruction of the Moreton Bay fig-
trees in Sydney claim that the latter are
“neither useful nor ornamental.” They lie.
The lowest bough of a Moreton Bay fig-tree
is, nine times out of 10, the best possible
place on which to hang an alderman. The
trees have a sombre loveliness which is all
their own, even when unornamented in any
way. Festooned with dead aldermen they
would take on an added beauty. The time
is approaching when, as a result of impu-
dent graft and tragic incompetence in the
Council, the citizens may find the best of all
uses for these imperishable vegetables. Let
us hope that when that glad day dawns,
every fig will be standing, ready for its
appointed burden of aldermanic remains or
corpse.
HIS LAND LEGS.
“Why on earth don t you walk straight?”
“I can't. I was at a Tango last night , and
I'm still wobbly.”
Glenelg, Adelaide’s most popular seaside
town, is to have its boat harbor at last.
Though it at first called itself “Holdfast
Bay” it is really just an open roadstead in
the shallow waters of St. Vincent’s Gulf,
but a big centre for yachting and fishing.
Any heavy blow is likely to send boats
ashore, and a sporting attempt, years ago,
to fit the Patawalonga mouth with lock-
gates, was a costly failure. The present
idea is to run a concrete breakwater in a
sweeping line of 1400 feet a little to seaward
of the long jetty. The S.A. Government
has accepted a £32,000 tender for the work.
It will be in about a 20-foot depth of water,
and has to be rammed down into the sandy
bottom. (There isn’t a rock within miles.)
“11.5.” makes a speech :
London was infested for years with a parasitic class
called “cab-runners.” They marked down a cab,
laden with luggage, at a railway station and trotted
beside it in the gutter, with their rags flapping hid-
eously in the wind, till it reached its destination.
Then, ashen with their exertions, panting horribly,
streaked, hyena-like, with perspiration, and bespat-
tered with mud, it was their habit to crave the job
,of carrying the boxes inside. They were utterly un-
necessary. The cabman was willing and able to
handle the luggage. So were the servants of the
house ; and so was the licensed porter who is still to
be found in shoals in the residential parts of London.
But. if one didn’t employ the cab-runner he swore
hideously, and, in any case, the epic misery of him
was a sort of argument in his favor. So he got the
job, and was allowed to pollute the house with his
awful boots, and -to infect clean portmanteaus and
the like with the dirt and disease which he radiated.
The arrival of the motor-car has killed this variety
of blackmailer, and in his stead there has arisen
another who is an almost equal nuisance. He is
called' a “minder,” and he has arrived in Sydney,
where the cult of the cab-runner never had any vogue
worth mentioning. The “minder” is to be encoun-
tered outside the Stadium, the Itnperial Salon (where
the tango-dancing rages), -and any other place where
privately-owned motor-cars congregate. II is mission

On the other hand, ibis an, easy thing to injure, more
or less, seriously. This is where the “minqer” comes
in. If spurned, he npav •furtively draw a knife across
the panels, or rlfTtip'a seat.-or do : other damage. So

ever was. And he -is. growing _jp y numbers
with astonishing speed. If the police got on to ffim
vigorously thejA-would do a better service to the
cause of, law and order than if they raided many
dozens of two-up seminaries.
“Chasuble”: One of the earth’s great dis-
illusions is Jerusalem. The clergyman who
goes there is never quite the same again.
It seems to ruin his punch. He loses half
his fire, and finds himself wishing vaguely,
in the silent watches of the night, that he
had followed his godless uncle’s advice and
become a wine and spirit merchant. Modern
Zion approximates with horrible
nearness to modern Margate
(England) from its garish, new
'ating-resorts to its voracious
and multitudinous tleas. The
ancient city where P i 1 a t e
dreamed all unconscious, like
the amiable, unimaginative gen-
tleman he was, through the
most epoch-making event in his-
tory is being fitted with electric
trams, electric street lamps,
water supply and proper sanita-
tion. The suburbs are growing
rankly, and the grand, historic
walls are to be torn down to
accommodate them and auc-
tioned for building material.
Even David’s Tower may go.
Four lines of trams will start
shortly from Jaffa Gate. One
will go to Bethlehem, which is
about six miles away. The
syndicate has a right of exten-
sion for 25 miles ,in any direc-
tion. New reservoirs are
to be made at the brook
Cherith and elsewhere.
There is a telephone ser-
vice in existence already.
The police ride bicycles.
Motor-boats run on the
Sea of Galilee (where, by
the way, a sardine factory
is being started) and on
the Jordan and Dead Sea.
Modern harvesting ma-
chines, operated by mo-
tors, work on the rich
plains of Sharon. Add to
all this the fact that the
Holy Land is hideous and
dusty and dejected-look-
ing, and the haunt of
insanitary clerics of vari-
ons sects who fight like dogs over
bogus relics, and one begins to understand
the dismay of the trusting religious
maniac when he first visits it. He
asks, figuratively speaking, to be in-
troduced to the fairest garden that he
ever dreamt of, and is led to a rubbish-tip
garnished with disused sardine-tins.
As a rule a gaudy ceremony serves at least
one good purpose: the arrangements hurt
somebody’s official dignity, and a kick in
the dignity is the best thing that can happen
to high officialdom. The President of the
Vic. Leg. Council (J. M. Davies), and the
Speaker of the Assembly (Frank Madden)
were the official somebodies who suffered
when the new Governor-General was sworn
in. The Lord High Issuer of Invitations
forgot to send them the cards due to their
respective positions, and when they were
hastily invited by telephone on the morning
of the day, and were implored to forgive and
forget the oversight, they were unable to
rise to the occasion. Their wounded dig-
nity kept them away from the ceremony.
They preferred to stop at home and nurse
the insult. Probably they tried to find a
little comfort in the supposition that the
new G.-G. would miss their robes of honor
and mourn their absence. The function had
to struggle along without them, of course,
in spite of the fact that the Clerk of Vic.
Parliaments and the Clerk of the Leg. Coun-
cil also felt called upon to blot themselves
out “when they learned that the Speaker
and President did not intend to be present.”
Shorn of these four old accustomed splendors
the function must have suffered a keen sense
of something wanting.
The Law made a brilliant ass of itself at
Richmond (Vic.), the other day, in dealing
with the case of three children, aged 12, eight
and lj- years. Having ascertained (1) that
the youngsters were in an advanced state of
disrepair, aggravated by semi-starvation and
want of clothing. (2) that their father was
an upstanding, lusty person with a passion
for beer, and (3) that the mother, though
willing, was physically unable to earn enough
to keep them properly—having, as above-
mentioned, ascertained all these things, the
Law proceeded to arrest the mother for hav-
ing “insufficient lawful means of support.”
Presumably the “insufficiency” was the beer-
stained husband. So the unhappily-married
woman was really arrested for being unhap-
pily married. Of course the Bench at once
discharged her and inquired .earnestly where
the husband was. Even in Victoria one hears
murmurs of wonderment, inasmuch as the
police didn’t think of impounding the hus-
band in the first instance.
WINE AND WORSHIP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A discussion then arose as to whether the use of
intoxicating wines should be maintained for sacra-
mental purposes. .. .It was decided not to exclude the
use of intoxicants for sacramental purposes. Such
action, the chairman said, would antagonise 70 per
cent, of the churchgoing people. —Report of a Sydney
convention of temperance workers.
This drink that decimates the land
Is certainly a curse;
It turns the saint to sinning, and
It makes the wicked worse ;
But in the church we e’en must stock
The boose that we abhor,
Because although our little flock
May like the preacher in his frock
They like the liquor more.
The sacramental cup we fill
With alcoholic wine ;
It is the crowd’s opinion still
The drink is quite divine.
We have to use a little tact
To draw men to the pew.
Two-thirds of them applaud the act
When we dish up the wine. 1 n fact.
The Devil does so too !
The congregations. stipulate
To help the “Cloth” to sup.
They will provide the flowing plate
If we provide the cup.
So comes the rather dubious luck
Of teachers apostolic,
With evil they must have some truck —
Brands from the burning that they pluck
Are not non-alcoholic.

DENNY, Attorney-
General in the .
late Verran
Government
(S.A.).
Aubrey Mowle, a son of the late S. M.
Mowle, Usher of the Black Rod in the N. S.
Wales Legislative Council, has just com-
pleted half a century’s service in Govern-
ment employ. First employed in the Chari-
ties Department, he is now a suburban
Chamber Magistrate. He and his father
were proteges of the late Terence Aubrey
Murray, erstwhile squatter and afterwards
Speaker of the Leg. Ass. and President of
the Leg. Council.
We are told that Brookes, the great Aus-
tralian tennis player, is about to write a
book. Of course. It has been predicted—
“ Books in the running Brookes.”
Hector Lamond. for some years managing
editor of Sydney Worker, has resigned the
chair, and H. E. Boote will occupy it.
Lamond served his apprenticeship with Mrs.
Boyle, of the Carcoar Chronicle —everyone
affectionately called her “Carcoar Mary.”
Mrs. Boyle married Mr. C. L. Garland, ex-
M.L.A., and now lives in retirement at
Neutral Bay.
Hugh McCrae, poet, artist and jolly good
fellow, left Sydney last week in a whirlwind
of good wishes to storm London and take
New York at the point of the pen. If he
fails, it won’t be for want of talent, for he
has enough of that to supply three ordinary
craftsmen. McCrae’s weakness lies in the
fact that he is about the most modest man
in the game and stampedes immediately the
necessary big drum of advertisement is beaten
in his vicinity. The day before he left Syd-
ney a friend found him lurking in a book-
shop, and was immediately pounced on and
given a small job. “Look here,” gasped the
tall author of “Satyrs, and Sunlight,” pass-
ing over half a sovereign. “I want to pre-
sent that book of mine to Blank. Would you
mind asking the salesman for it? I don’t
like to!” A man like that makes the modest
violet look like a red circus band.
“S.S.”: Notice the rush of light on Glad-
stone’s character in the more recent Parnell
disclosures. The monumentally respectable
W.E.G. knew of Parnell’s goings-on with
Kitty O’Shea, and took advantage of the
fact to keep in touch with the Nationalist
leader for the said Kitty,, “but changed his
attitude after the divorce in deference to the
Nonconformist conscience.” So even the
Good Old Man thought nothing much of
manifold sins till they were made manifest.
Mrs. Victor Watt, one of the oldest resi-
dents on the Lachlan (N.S.W.), died re-
cently, aged 66 years. She was a daughter
of the late John Crook, who was harbor-
master at Sydney for 40 years. Mr. Watt
is a son of the late William Redfern Watt,
who represented Carcoar in the third
fourth Parliaments (1859-62). This Wil-
liam Redfern Watt was a nephew of Dr. Red-
fern, who was sent to N. S. Wales for his
share —a small one —in the Mutiny of the
Nore. He was one of those appointed a
J.P. by Macquarie, and invited to that Gov-
ernor’s dinner-table, much to the disgust of
the “pure merinos” ; and it was he who gave
a name to the Sydney suburb that McGowen
represents. He had a grant of 100 acres
there.
William Bede Melville, a Sydney journal-
list, who had much to do with the Young
Protectionist party 20-odd years ago, died
on May 19. He was a native of Mo.long
(N.S.W.), where his father was a builder
and contractor and his mother a lady of
some literary pretensions. In the JO s he
joined first the Australian Star (now Syd-
ney Sun), and then the Melbourne Age.
Later on he was private sec. to George Dibbs.
On the outbreak of the Boer war he went to
Africa and did work there for London Daily
Mail. In later years he thrice contested the
Molong electorate, and, later, he opposed
David Storey for Randwick. For some
years he was connected with the Country
Association, and at his death was edi-
tor of The Bystander. In the lobbies ot
Parliament House, which he knew very well,
he was best remembered as “the man who
punched Nick Willis” in one of the. numer-
ous rough-ups of a very turbulent time.
W. H. Thodey, for 20 years commercial
editor of the Arcus, has passed out in Mel-
bourne, aged 71. He wasn’t a trained jour-
nalist, and never could put things entertain-
ingly ; but he had a very large knowledge of
finance, and far more of business than most
commercial editors, Till he was past 40 he
was in the store or at the desk ; his last job
in that line was in the timber trade in
Maoriland. Then from the little Austra-
lian Trade Review in Melbourne he passed
on to the Argus, giving an eye also to the
Insurance and Banking Record ; and tor
the last six years or so the latter dry-as-
dust record of financial ups and downs had
all the old man’s time. He had his preju-
dices and stuck to them; but at least .he
had the great virtue of being utterly in-
corruptible.
“S.T.S.” on a deceased journalist: —
The cable-man was too busy to send word of the
death of Hubert Bland in April. Bland was a gifted
journalist, on London Daily Chronicle, in an un-
attached sort of way, for 20 years past. He was
known as “the Socialist with the monocle, because
he always continued to look like the spruce Foreign
Office official he was before his “dreadful” opinions—
-20 years ago they were considered dreadful caused
him to become a freelance. His Socialism was of the
Fabian variety. His writing on literature and life
was artistic, and sometimes curiously frank. . But he
was overshadowed by a brilliant wife. “Who’s Who
actually ignores him except as the husband of E.
Nesbit.” The lady—who is a cousin of Paris Nesbit,
K.C., of Adelaide —is a poetess, a strong novelist
(anyone who wants to see a study of utter numbing
fear should read “Salome and the Head”), and to-
day’s best-known author of children’s books that are
quite attractive to grown-ups. So Bland’s essays were
overlooked. It is a terrible thing to feel you have
something to say, and then to be known merely as
someone’s husband.
Died last week, Mrs. Martha Melville, of
Oakey Park (N.S.W.), aged just on 97
years. Until her death she was the head of
five generations living under the one roof —
probably a record for Australia.
HENRY
JONES, the
Jam King
(Hobart,
Tas.).
The Giles family in Adelaide has multi-
plied, past all reckoning. Mortimer Giles,
just dead at 65, was perhaps the best-known
member of it, and he was one of 10 brothers.
He had been all his life in the Government
service as a land-expert, first as surveyor in
the field, then as draftsman in the city. For
the last 10 years he had been Registrar-
General in the Lands Titles Office. He
leaves four sons to carry on the name. The
Giles family recalls George Dibbs, of
N.S.W., and his story which began: ‘One
day, when I was crossing George-street with
10 of my daughters”
Willie Watt, the Victorian Premier, is
that most foolish of all persons—a sick man
who refuses to give himself a chance to get
well again. He sticks to “work” when he
is not in a fit state to perform it. His
malady makes him as irritable as a bear
with a sore nose. He feels angrily dis-
posed towards everything and everybody,
including himself. Having achieved his
ambition to be Premier, he is mad to think
that his health, temper, judgment and
prospects have been impaired by his efforts
to get there.
Cabled that William Howard Smith is
claiming, as next of kin, the intestate estate
of E. E. Smith, late of Melbourne, which
is valued at £252,770. On the other side it
is maintained that Mr. Smith made a will in
which he directed that 20,000 preference
shares in the Howard Smith Co. be held in
trust to pay dividends to testator’s cousin,
Captain Gerrit Smith for his life, and after
his death to his wife and family, the shares
to be ultimately divided between the sons
of the captain. The residue of the estate
was to be held in trust to pay income for
life to testator’s wife; after her death it
was to be divided among the persons who
would, at the death of the survivor of the
testator and his wife, have been entitled to
the personal estate under statutes. Mrs.
Smith predeceased her husband, and the re-
siduary is now claimed to. be divisible
between his five brothers, sisters nod. a
daughter of a deceased sister. Bruce Smith,
M.H.R., is one of the brothers.
The eastern slopes of the Blue Moun-
tains, from Ivurrajong to Colo, bred a race
of bootless giants in the ’so’s. At Colo the
pubkeeper, named Ivory, rarely permitted
leather to cover his feet. He was known to
the district on the Colo and Hawkesbury
Rivers as “The Barefooted Publican. ’ He
had a mate near Comleroy-road, named
William Freeman, who had the same con-
tempt for boots. Nevertheless, on one day
in the year when the trip into Richmond
for renewal of license was made, these bush
publicans had to don the detested boot.
On one occasion, when the day of penance
arrived, Freeman found that he could
neither beg, borrow nor steal a pair of
boots in the neighborhood. “The Barefooted
Publican,” who arrived from Colo on the
main road, found his beer-brother in dire
distress, and t-heir two heads hit upon a
bright scheme. Driving up to within a few
hundred yards of the licensing court, Ivory
pulled on his boots and hobbled to get his
license papers fixed up. That completed, he
returned and passed the boots over to
Freeman, who was then able to make a pre-
sentable appearance at the court.
The story is told of the late King Edward
that he was once driven to the house of a
fashionable unmarried lady by mistake.
Leaving the Marlborough Club after dusk,
he got into the one-horse brougham which
was waiting outside, called “All right” to
the coachman, and was borne away to the
quiet little ne§t of the dove whilst he
thought he was returning in his own vehicle
to Buckingham Palace. As to whether he
entered the nest when the brougham (be-
longing to a noble dook) had stopped at the
door, the story gives no hint. Evidently the
coachman must have told him the tenant s
name, and Edward was hardly the sort to
rush away without stopping to pay his
respects to a queen of beauty.
Judge Gilfedder, of the M.L. Native Land
Court, has been very much in the limelight
lately. Last month the Native Land Court
took over the work of the Maori Land
Board and of the Ikaroa Board ; so in future
Gilfedder will have to sort out and patch up
most of the litigation-loving Maoris’ dis-
putes. And the Maori will fight a 30 years
war over a dog. Since Joshua W illiams
retired Gilfedder is the only man on the
M.L. bench who has the degree of Master of
Laws. He began work as a schoolmaster
away down at the south end of the islands;
but ultimately he plunged into the law and
practised in Invercargill. In 1896 he broke
into politics, and was in the Representatives
for six years. Seven years ago he became a
Judge of the Native Land Court, and he
has struggled with our brown b r °th er ever
since.
Passed over at Nelson (M.L.) recently,
Colonel W. H. W T ebb, for some years in
command of the old Volunteer Forces in the
unstable isles. He controlled the despatch
of the various Cohentingents that departed
amidst much beer and Gor’ Save to Chowth
Africa about 14 years ago; also he steered
the Imperial Troops through his land a
little later, and he had charge of the forces
that stood around the duke who is now Geo.
V. when that sarang went to inspect the
Maori maiden at Rotorua and other expen-
sive tourist resorts. The Colonel retired
some years ago. None of his successors
equalled him for detail. At all the big public
functions, where his troops were part of the
show, there was never a hitch, as he had
every move mapped out beforehand, and
Satan help the man who failed to carry
them out. The things that were said to
him blew him right out of his boots and
scattered his hat into the deep sea.
C. WEBB GILBERT, the sculptor, who has
just left Australia in pursuit of more art.
HIS OWN PRIVATE HEAVEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One of those present stated that Bishop Averill
(who had been approached with a request to preside,
but had declined on account of a prior engagement),
“carried a briar pipe about with him.’’
The name of Judge Cooper was also amongst those
suggested, and the president (Mr. C. G. Hill) stated
that before his Honor became a Judge he used to
smoke. “When he attended our meetings,” said Mr.
Hill, “he would produce a cigarette afterwards and
light it, and it did annoy me.”
“We don’t want anyone who smokes,” remarked
another member. “But p-rhaps Judge Cooper has
given it up since he became a Judge.”
Eventually the selection of a chairman tvas left
to the president and secret::-y (Mr. W. J. Mac-
dermott). — Extract from report of Auckland (M.L.)
Band of Hope meeting.
The sour suburban saint looked down
From the bar of Heaven. His E.P. crown
Had the bright, raw look of a wedding-gift.
He saw the curtain of rose-clouds lift,
And the bleak expanse of the lone, chill skies
Rolled out dead level before his eyes,
Like a table covered with grey oilcloth,
Cleared in anger and scrubbed in wrath.
He searched in vain for some cosy leaven,
But there was none in that smokeless heaven.
The sour suburban saint looked round,
But never a glimpse of cheer he found ;
The place was as clear as the sea —the air
Like icicle fingers caressed his hair ;
There was no sound—no sign saw he
But the rolling clouds of Eternity.
Not a wraith walked by—-not a ghostly bloke
Rose up like a wisp of tobacco smoke.
The clouds sailed by him from east to west
Till he danced on his crown and beat his chest.
“Hey! why am I left alone to freeze?”
He shrieked and sank on his bony knees,
And knotted his hands and raised his chin.
“I’m sorry now that I ever got in!....
I did without smoking and drinking, too!
But did those vices appeal to you?”
Through the speaking-tube then the scornful voice
Howled these dreadful words: “’Twas your own
mean choice i
You tyrant! you got On the whole earth’s nerves —
And each gets the heaven that he deserves !”
The saint on the parapet gave a yell
And dived like a feather straight for Hell.

Some shareholders are beginning’ to say that it is a
long time between drinks. It is two years and a
half since they had a chance to suck in some new
shares, and they are not used to such waits. Still,
put this to the credit of the one bank with head-
quarters in Westralia —whenever it has issued shares
it has called for a big premium to add to the re-
serves. Of late, from £25 to £3O has been paid
in for each £lO share; hence, though the dividend
is nominally 20 p.c., on the bulk of the capital it
is reallv no mote than about 8 p.c. One result of
this policy of asking a stiff premium for the new
share is that, though only £75,000 of new capital
has been got in since 1908, bringing the total up to
£250,000, no less than £172,932 has come in by
way of premiums. Now, the limit of authorised capi-
tal having been reached, shareholders must wait until
formalities for increasing the figure are completed;
and the chairman hinted at the half-yearly meeting
that they were considering the necessary steps.
Not that the bank urgently needs more funds; at
present capital and reserves stand at £944,435, and
the public’s money in deposits, etc., is equal to less
than £3 for every £1 belonging to the shareholders
-—an exceptionally low rate, and one that means par-
ticularly good security for the depositors, provided, of
course, assets are worth what they stand at in the
books. The bank, being confined to Westralia, has
to rely pretty largely on the goldfields and on the
values which the goldfields create; and it is well
known that the goldfields, on the whole, are not what
they were. Certainly agriculture is doing its best to
fill the gap, but in very many parts of the West
where agriculture has been tried it begins to be
viewed as a doubtful proposition. Perhaps in recog-
nition of this, the directors have been slowing down:

Thus £223,314 of advances have come in, and, one
way and another, the liquid assets have benefited to
the extent of £202,661. No doubt the bank, feeling
that the money isn’t wanted urgently just now, is
getting itself into a position to be again able to
give a hand when W.A. strikes a really bad year or
two. Naturally, with so large a proportion of its
assets held liquid—there are liquid assets represent:
ing no less than 44 p.c. of the liabilities—the earn-
ings are not very high. For the past six months,
calculated on capital and reserves combined, they
were at the rate of only £7 7s. 9d. p.c. per annum.

Twelve months ago The Bulletin, seeing that this
bank held over £8 of the public’s money for every
£1 of its own, remarked that at the very first favor-
able opportunity it ought to get in more capital.
The favorable opportunity has arrived sooner than
The Bulletin expected. Continued high prices for
property enabled the co. to get rid of more of ; ts
old securities; and on a revaluation of those still
left on hand the directors felt justified in disclosing
£135,000 of the internal reserve which had been
built up out of surpluses realised in excess of book
values. The table explains that £85,000 of this
amount has been written off. The premises account
gains by this. It looks as though the management
has done in that respect a bit more than it has
taken credit for. At any rate, premises account has
shrunk by £109.124 during the year. It is pos-
sible, no 'doubt, that the bank has been selling some
premises, though the natural tendency lately has been
to expand rather than contract. With this satisfac-
tory disclosure of inner reserves, and with the old
dividends eating up loss than half the current profits,
the management decided to put up the ordinary div.
to 7 p.c. for the last half-year, making it 6 p.c.
for the whole year; and, following that, the uncalled
balance of £2 10s. per share on the ordinaries is to
be got in. This will make them £lO paid. They
ire £22 10s. shares; but the other £l2 10s. is a
reserve liabilitv- With the dividend raised to 7 p.c.
there won’t be many grumbles about paving up the
£2 10s. ; and when the unissued 12,500 shares are
presently sent to market, there shouldn’t be many
unapplied for.
The hank is taking one other step of some import-
ance. As the final result of the bog which the Lon-
don, like most other Australian banks, got into 20-
odd vears ago, it agreed to pay 41 p.c. on the old
deposits. It was a stiff price, and for some years
was a terrible draff, but the London felt that the old
depositors, who couldn’t get their money when it
was promised them, were entitled to more considera-
tion than they received from some of the other banks.
Gradually that burden has been got rid of in this
fashion: —

During the recent season of dear money there wasnt
much to be gained by prepaying the old deposits, the
last of which were to fall due in 1917 ; but, partly
because deposits are cheaper, and partly, no doubt, to
wipe the last stain of the old trouble off the balance-
sheet, it was decided lately to repay the lot on April 1.
The present accounts don’t show that transaction.
But they do show that there was plenty of money
for the purpose; and then there is the new capital to
come in to refill the till and provide for expansion.
In 10 years the aggregate figures have shown some
fine movements: —■

During the last 12 months, when things, especially in
Victoria, were for a while far from good, the average
pace wasn’t maintained ; on the contrary, with de-
posits shrinking a little and the outlook very un-
certain, it was thought advisable to get in advances
and improve the cash position: —

Premises •• 391,994 282,870 Dec. 109,124
That makes the cash position very good: liquid assets
represented 45 p.c. of all liabilities except the old
deposits. With £546,000 taken out to repay the
latter, there would still remain 36 p.c. of liquid
assets. And, as before remarked, there is the new
capital to come in; and no doubt a fair amount of
the old deposits will become, or by this time have
become, new deposits. Considering the comparatively
high percentage of liquid assets the earnings have
been splendid : last year they amounted to £l3 Is. sd.
p.c. of the capital and visible reserves as at December,
1912. The risks carried by shareholders were consid-
erable, there being so large a proportion of other
peoples money in the business; but as against that
must be set the big additions made latterly to re-
serves. So large a return might certainly mean
doubtful securitii s: but if the advances are as good
as the yield, then the result calls for three cheers.
On paper it is easily the bpst the present bank lias
produced; and it would have been incredible 10
years ago. # *

The amalgamation of the Standard-Waygood with the
Hydraulic Engineering and Hercules was completed
during the year ; and as each of them was a fusion
of two or more concerns, what were formerly four or
more businesses are now under the one roof. ur “
ther, just prior to the last amalgamation, the Stan-
dard-W’ ay good had swallowed N. 8., Ltd., and thereby
got 65,000 deferred shares in Automatic Telephones
(Australasia), Ltd. —the concern which has the con-
tract with the Commonwealth Government to instal
automatic ’phones in Perth, Balmain, Brighton (Vic.)
and other exchanges. Twelve months ago Stan-
dard-'Waygood’s capital was in 100,000 £1 shares
fully paid and 25,000 £1 shares paid to 10s. ; and
as there are now 143,879 fully-paid shares it looks
as though the Engineering-llercules shareholders got
the odd 43,879 for their end of the business. But
the very energetic management has still another iron
or two in the fire; in particular, there are the affairs
of Lift Inspection and Insurance, Ltd., a co. pro-
moted by Standard-Waygood, which owns 19,350
fully-paid £1 shares in it. The authorised capital
of this co. is £50,000 ; but apparently very few
shares are issued which the big co. with the three-
barrelled name doesn’t hold. The Telephone shares
(Is ) are taken in at 35., which is much below their
last quotation, and the 19,350 Lift Inspection and
Insurance shares at £12,000 the lot. There were on
June 30 last, when the Automatic Telephones accounts
were made up, 100,000 £1 ordinary shares and
100,000 deferred shares issued, the former paid to
10s ; and, though work had been only just started,
a net profit of £567 was shown for the year. Ordi-
nary shares take 10 p.c. first; huif the balance of
profits belongs to the deferred shares. The Lift In-
spection and Telephones investments stood in the
books 12 months ago at £21,760. This year the
investments are not itemised, but the total is
£23,254. It is not likely that this co. has got much
if anything yet by way of dividend from Telephones ;
nevertheless the “return on investments, etc ,” is given
this year as £9B23—which suggests that Lift Inspec-
tion and Insurance, Ltd., is a very profitable affair.

From the total for the past year £11,058 has to be
deducted for general exes. The manufacturing Pro-
fits are still disappointing, but are better than they
were the previous year., The other two lines, which
are probably of the least value to Australia, show
up splendidlv. The fir-t of them is quite likelv to
show up still better, the co. having lately secured
the NSW and Queensland agency of the British
Westinghouse Co ; while from Automatic Telephones
it is not possible to say yet what big plums may not
be picked. There are large possibilities in that hold-
ing, at any rate. On the other hand, all Australian
experience shows that borrowing booms and construc-
tion activitv go together: so it looks just about cer-
tain that this co. is having a period of abnormal
profits, from the sales and contracts branch, anyway.
Considering the extent of the contracting business
(the co had £ 130,000 worth of uncompleted orders
on hand at March 31), the liabilities are moderate;
including everything—some deposits among the lot
the total was £44.286. Besides the probably under-
valued investments before mentioned the assets in-
elude £87,223 of stocks and work in progress,
£64 818 of book debts, £23,161 of plant, and just
upon £50,000 in premises and cash. It is notori-
ously easv for engineering stock and plant to creep
up in book value far beyond its sale value; but so
far as one can judge the management has kept this
co.’s assets of all kinds written down; and the co. s
great success (largely due, no doubt, to its good luck
in being born at the right time) has made it easy to
do the writing-down job very thoroughly.

The capital used to be £120,000. Then, last year,
£30,000 was added by an issue of bonus shares and
shareholders were given a chance to put up another
£30.000. As it looked certain that the old 15 p.c.
would be paid on the new capital, the chance wasn’t
scarned. Just how well the co. has done, the accounts
probably don’t show, because of the writings down.
There may be a hint at the truth in these 'figures:—
Feb.,’o9. Feb ,’l4.
Liabilities £3,946 £26,i54
Assets, other than stock and plant 60,984 151,860
Surplus assets .. .. £57,038 £125,106
That’s an increase of £68,068, of which new capital
has supplied £30,000. So, assuming that stocks and
plant have been merely kept up, the profit in addi-
tion to the reserves during the past five years seems
to have been over £38,000 ; and the chgnces are
that the stocks have been more than kept up. f, ur "
ther, of the capital ( £180,000) no less than
£140,000 is represented either by cash or by city
freehold 5 and a co. which has that much of its capi-
tal thus secured and can still easily pay 15 p.c. may
reckon that it has struck gold. That profits will con-
tinue at their present level under all conditions is, no
doubt, quite unlikely. The city chemist nowadays
deals in so many luxurious sundries; and on the
luxury there is nearly always a thumping profit. At
present most of us can run to luxuries ; but the time
will inevitably come when we shall do pretty well it
we-can make our incomes run to bread and butter.

1914.. 21,198 1320 124 „ ~11,009 43,351
That is the best profit of the 17 years ; though, of
course, profits should be greater nowadays because
capital is more than twice.as large as it was in the
early years of the old co. The extra-fine figures are
due to two things: (1) Splendid prices for wool and
other pastoral products and ,(2) a very good season
in N. S. Wales and Queensland, where the co. oper-
ates. The co. lives on commission mostly; and with
a booming market it generally costs the commis-
sion agent actually less to sell stuff than it does
when prices (and consequently commissions) are poor
and the market sluggish. And the excellent season
has provided this and other cos. with more stuff to
sell. Bridge’s was until lately a N. S. Wales house.
Then the directors got an idea that'there was money
to be made in Queensland, and business was
started in Brisbane. After testing the North-
ern State it was decided not to potter along, but to
plunge y a freehold was bought at Bulimba in 1910,
and what is probably the best wool warehouse in
Queensland was built on it. Simultaneously the
co. has been putting a lot of money into additional
store premises at Pyrmont (Sydney) ; hence the free-
hold property account has danced along from £81,556
in 1910, when the public started to come into the
co., to £152,804 at present, notwithstanding the
recent sale of the two old store premises at Darling
Harbor. The capital is £110,075, while the reserves
(after paying current dividend) amount to £43,351 ;
total £153,426. This is practically the amount
represented by freehold stores. All the sharehold-
ers’ own funds being thus in bricks and mortar, it
follows that the money to finance the business has
to be borrowed. The next table shows the position in
detail: —

Liquid assets 28,970 1,439 1,4 <0 „,312
So the liabilities have increased by nearly £60,000
during the year; on the other side the advances
against wool and produce, with “sundry debtors
accounts,” have increased by rather more than
£60,000. So far as the growth is due to the
expansion of the business —which has no doubt been
very marked, especially in Brisbane it is all right.
But these are perilous, times for any co. to do much
pastoral financing—unless it refuses to accept pre-
sent prices, of either stock or pastoral. property, as
any sort of a basis to lend on. The directors seem
to realise that conditions are abnormal; anyway,
though they pay 124 P-e., they have decided not to
issue the bonus shares which were authorised about a
year ago. After giving the matter careful considera-
tion, they have thought better of it. According to
the chairman at the annual meeting the Board is
aiming at £lOO,OOO of reserves; and it looks as
though the bonus issue will be hung up till that
figure is reached. It is to be hoped so, at anv rate.
It will be quite time enough to do the amiable and
scatter bonuses around when the co. has passed
through the ordeal of a drought- with perhaps a
period of low prices attached. It won’t do the co.
much good then to appear as a poor hard-un, unable
to pay more than a 3 p.cs d.iv., When if it hadn’t
issued bonus shares it might figure as a fairly robust
and prosperous institution paying 5 p.c. in spite of
had times. This piling up of shares, which has been
very popular during the last few years, is going to
make quite a lot of cos. feel very wretched some day.

That writing-off for the year is perhaps the comple-
tion of the job, which a new lot of directors set
themselves, to provide adequately for past deprecia-
tion, and thus set the assets down to their real W '•
With a deficit of £6627 the Board now proposes tnac
£7OOO, or one-half, of the capital should
off. But it won't, by any means, follow that tne
capital then remaining will be represented by vai
able assets. This shows the position:—

Goodwill, leaseholds and improvements to leasehold
premises may, of course, be worth money; but the
goodwill of a business in which half the capital has
been lost in three years can’t be exactly a goldmine.
The liabilities consist chiefly of debentures; ana
though £2OOO of these are to be paid off now, the
payment will correspondingly reduce the “assets apart
from goodwill and leases,’’ and leave those other
assets to consist mainly of plant and stock, the pre-
sent management deserves credit for getting to work
with the axe and cleaning out the old deadwood;
and with that determined kind of control, the future
is not altogether hopeless. #

Sydney’s small-pox and the consequent shrinkage in
inter-State trade are blamed for the drop in the past
year’s profits; but the excuse would look better if
a shrinkage hadn’t been going on for the past three
years. The accounts show a few other reasons. In
1904 there was a mortgage of £64,000, which called
for £2304 as interest; now, though the plaster has
been reduced to £52,000, the interest requires
£2862. so that, though the co. has the use of
£ll,OOO less money, it pays £558 more interest
per vear. Further than that, the cost of provisions,
etc.," has gradually gone up, though the accounts
don’t give the slightest idea of the extent of the
increase. The profit and loss account used to give
the information required, but all flesh is
dear, so that account is now reduced to a
mere skeleton. During the year the Grand
has installed new lifts, and the cost of in-
stalling ( £2305) is reckoned in the table as
written off. Apart from that nothing has been
visibly written off to cover ordinary depreciation and
smashes, though the directors mention that £l6lb
has been spent on renewals and patches. 1' urmture
stands at the same as it did 12 months ago, plus a
few additions. In that connection there is an item
in the balance-sheet which casts a doubt on the
profits and reserves in the table above— Deprecia-
tion account,” to which £5OO was added during the
year. If this amount is necessary to cover wear and
tear not provided for by renewals and repairs actu-
ally made, the profits and reserves are overstated to
that extent. This comparison shows the co. s finan-
cial position now and 10 years ago:

Shareholders who back a bill of that size e .
fretting* something more substantial than p.c.,
but, as remarked before, the mortgage, which is the
principal liability, costs a good deal more to keep
than it used to, though it is doubtful if it is earning
much more. Still the comparison shows an.improve-
ment in 10 years of £16,081, though that includes
a small amount of capital got in meantime.

The Manly Hotels, Ltd.—-This co
which owns the Hotel Pacific, ,at Manly (N.S.W.),
was formed in 1910 to buy the Clarendon, on the
Ocean Beach, and build a new and elaborate residential
pub on the fine site so long occupied by Kilminster s
The co raised £35,000 by shares and £20,000 by 5*
p.c. debentures, the latter issued to the vendor, the
freehold land and building cost £44,228; and as
furniture, plant, etc., cost over £13,000 and stood m
the books at the end of the year at £12,624, while
preliminary exes, mopped up £2984, it follows that
the co. has had to lean prettv heavily on its banker.
The total liabilities, including the debentures, are
£30,224. Until last year the co. hadn t a fair
chance to show what it could do. The place was lit-
tered most of the time with chips and mortar. As
at December 31, 1912, there was, consequently, an
accumulated loss of £1327. Last year things were
a shade better; a gross profit of £1163 was made,
after paying £783 for repairs and renewals; but a
further £1059 set aside to provide for depreciation
reduced the profit to £lO4. Of course, the directors
know that that isn’t good enough, and blame the
ferry strike and the small-pox scare for most of it.
But it isn’t likely that there ever will be a year
when everything will go quite right; and, anyhovv,
the small-pox scare happened in winter, and that isnt
the season when a scare is likely to do the Pacifit
the most damage. The fact is the Pacific has been
experimenting, and hasn’t yet found out the best way
to manage itself. When it has spent its money and
learned its lesson and established its connection, there
may be good divs in it for shareholders, as their
capital is very moderate. Until then the big deben-
ture debt, carrying as much as 5i p.c., plus the in-
terest on the other debts, amounts to a burden.

Once more the co. pays no dividend ; but the Board
has had heaps of experience in finding excuses, and
has no difficulty in now producing a. few reasons why
shareholders should hope for better things in future.
The water supply was bad, it says, in the early part

profits would have looked better if the eo. hadn’t had
to pay another £4872 in connection with the old, ill-
advised suit; on the other hand, the reserve to meet
. fluctuations in metal prices was drawn upon to the
extent of £4300, and that amount, being taken out
of a fund which wasn’t reckoned in the reserves
shown above, isn’t deducted from the half-year’s pro-
fits. Moreover, some at least of the cost of the new
, ventilation scheme was charged to mine plant (capi-
tal) account.
Apparently no estimate of ore reserves has been
made lately ; six months ago the total that could be
measured up was 230,000 tons, and 43,054 tons were
broken during the term. Prospecting by drill and
otherwise is in progress ; but no finds of any conse-
quence have been made. Realising that it had but a
short life as an ore-producer, the co. decided to go
into business as a buyer of ore and by-products, and
it has on hand slimes for which it has paid over
£86,000. Slime treatment has made great progress
during the past few years, and, though the Junction
North seemed at the time to have paid a very big
price for its early purchases, it may yet make a
fair profit. But, especially with stuff like slimes,
what that profit is likely to be one could only guess
at wildly. During the past six months, in addition
to the sulphides from the mine, the co. treated 18,898
tons of purchased ore and 32,939 tons of slimes and
t-ailings from the purchased and other dumps; and
the figures at the ton of these remarks show the net
profit from the whole 95,000 tons. Even allowing for
some adverse circumstances the result from the using
up of all this material isn’t encouraging.
The surplus of floating assets over liabilities
amounts to £95,365. But as £86,509 of the assets
consists of payments made on slimes awaiting treat-
ment, the floating assets are not liquid assets by any
means. Still, they will, no doubt, be got into money,
because even if things turned out very badly and no
profit could be made, it would still pay the co. to
treat the stuff in order to get back the capital (or
part of it) represented by this material. .
Melbourne Tram Co. is handing out a
cash bonus of 10s. per share on July 1, which means
that an amount equal to the entire paid capital is to
be returned. But that won’t seriously affect the fat
dividends, which will continue at least till the end
of June, 1916, when the co.’s lease expires. The
Tramways (Municipal) Trust, which kindly provided
the co. with the capital to pay for construction, will
also next month repay £1,200,000 of its £1,650,000
loan. This money has been furnished by a sinking
fund chipped off the co.’s profits.
■***•*
Two Broken Hill dividends have had the
clippers applied to them. Block 10 finds the strain
of the 2s. per quarter too much, and now declares
Is. instead. However, a consolation is offered in the
shape of a sixpenny bonus. The South again comes
down to something sane, the new dividend being 6s.
instead of the former bloated Bs. Junction North
looks a candidate for a fresh call.
Broken Ilill spreads the news that the
neighboring Round Hill is to have still another go.
Last time John Warren was the director of opera-
tions. When he got down a few feet cash petered
out, and Round Hill became the refuge of the sleep-
ing lizard. Before that, Fitzgerald Moore and broker
Dix gathered up a corner in Round Hill shares,
which burst under pressure—-rumor avers because
broker Greenway dropped free scrip very liberally into
the melting pot. Brandon’s programme to-day is
understood to be a tattoo with the diamond-drill.
Well, a new mining sensation is badly needed, and it
might as well come from Round Hill as from any-
where. Anyway, with George Fairbairn, L. K. S.
Mackinnon, Fred Keats, Weinberg and Wallach in
the lead, there ought to be plenty of dash in the
new team.
Another lode, 4ft. wide and worth 10 p.e.
tin, has. been found at Ardlethan (N.S.W.). This
time it is in the Drumlish. While waiting for Ardle-
than to pay a few dividends, this paper begins to
wonder how the field manages for country rock. So
many thousand lodes have been discovered that there
can’t be room for more than a few inches of mullock
between them.
Great Cobar has been taking a little while
to get over the shock of King’s revised estimate of
profit, and his announcement that the workings were
too dangerous to continue ore extraction and that
35,000 would be needed to make them safe again.
There are, however, signs of restored animation, as
the official receivers are getting busy on the job of
filling the stopes. This work may take three months.

Boulder Perseverance (W.A.) treated
244,841 tons in 1913 and got £253,719 for its
trouble. With £18,219 chipped off for develop-
ment and £2772 for depreciation, the net profit was
£6897, making a carry forward (with £57,747 left
over from the previous year) of £64,644. The fact
that the surplus has shrunk despite greater tonnage
and lower working costs is deplored ; the decrease,
it is stated, is entirely due to the lower average
value of the ore drawn from the stopes and sent to
the mill. The general managers have something to
say on this point, and the pith of their remarks is
that, owing to the method of stoping, the grade of
ore treated has been poorer than the average value
of the broken ore reserves; but this, they opine, will
adjust itself in time. Actual ore reserves are esti-
mated at 516,978 tons of 25s value, and “probable”
reserves at 321,280 tons of the nominal value of
21s. 4d., making a total of 838,258 tons of an aver-
age gross value of 235. 6d. This is said to be
irrespective of ore which has not been sufficiently
developed to justify its inclusion. The management
reports (1) that no fresh discoveries of ore have
been made, and (2) that a geological examination
of the rocks of the lower levels of the mine show
that no danger is to be apnrehended of the calc
schist having any ill effect on the property until a
much greater denth is reached. They might just
as well have added that the bottom of the mine
couldn’t look much worse than it does at present.
Black Ban go West (W.A.) claims to have
300 tons of good stuff dumped, and to be able to
send 500 tons to the mill inside a month. The
stoping width of the reef at 500 ft. is said to be
6ft. to 7ft.
Mararoa (W.A.) is credited with having
dug tons out of a 2ft. reef at the 100 ft. level
of its Holden’s Find option, and crushed it for 740 z.
over the plates.
Mountain Queen (W.A.) is again trying
to buy the Great Victoria, but complains that the
owners are sticking out for too much.
Tributors have given up Burbanks Birth-
day Gift owing to unprofitable results. The co.
is not in a position to work the property itself, and
has got exemption in order to think over things.
Tributors continue to overrun North Kal-
gurli (W.A ), and a few of them anpear to be doing
well. One party is working a good shoot at 500 ft.,
another is bogging into 2oz. sulphides at 70ft., while
a third is breaking specimen telluride and gold ore
at 45ft. The shutting down of the Associated North-
ern Co.’s Iron Duke mill and the absence of any
other suitable customs treatment plant in the district
is troubling the parties working on the property a
good deal. It seems impossible for them to get a
satisfactory extraction elsewhere.

People in the West are wondering why
Greenfinch let the Empress option at Magnet slip
through its fingers. The owners have just obtained
£1430 from 102 tons, and since the beginning of the ’
year have extracted 266 tons and crushed £3BOO out
of it. The mine previously yielded £30,000 above
the 200 ft. level; 6 f t. of rich ore was cut in the shaft
at 245 ft. and another level is about to be driven at
300 ft.

Boulder Perseverance has bucked up a
bit during the past few months. The grade of the
ore milled during Anril was 225. 10d., compared
with 20s Id. in February and 21s. 7d. in March, and
the profit earned was £4743. Costs averaged 17s. 4d.

Victorian Manganese, Iron and Steel
Co. has huge possibilities but very little cash. The
co. has got railway rights besides its iron and man-
ganese leases, and, if the glad-eyed optimist is to be
believed, has a bigger deposit than the Broken Hill
Prop.’s Iron Knob waiting funds to cut into the iron
and steel business of the Commonwealth.

“.Timmy” Maokay is a chiel fra’ Aberdeen,
besides being the secretary of the New Langi Hogan
(Vic.). Having a big co. and a semi-waterlogged
lead to prop in a deadly-dull market, he comes out
with a report and plans brimful of candor. The
plan shows what The Bulletin has always con-
tended, that the work done in the Langi lead is
relatively the size of a fly spot on a Collins-street
winnow. Then Bill Toole, in his manager’s report,
lifts the curtain high. Driving off the No. 1 rise
was stopped because the cost of work in wet vvash
ran up to 405., as against 6s. in drained ground.
Bears who. said that work was stopped because of
the poverty of the ground have now to make the
best they can of this upper-cut of Toole’s. Water
pressure, owing to the big* flow down the two rises,
has fallen to 71b. to the square inch. Surely that
is low enough to allow of progress. Toole repeats
that the story of the yield of lOJoz. from 10 fathoms
didn’t represent the value of wash treated because
most .of the stuff was left overhead in the drive;
and isn’t it a rule that nearly all the gold is in
the bottom of the wash, instead of half-way up it?
The co. is now punching into the No. 2 ' shaft to
get under. the Cathcart gutter, and two months
should see. the plat under way. Meantime Cathcart
Central will be helping the Langi Logan folk to an
idea whether their end of the Cathcart glitter is to
be profitable.

Mount Morgan shares have been having a
rocky passage these last two or three weeks. The
change-over to the big new plant-is found to be not
as easy a job as was expected. Rumor, of course,
has been active. One whisper says that the slag
foundations of the new plant are beginning to settle.
Another attributes the shakiness to dissension in the
overhead-rig. The market’s reply to the recent direc-
toral announcement that all was well was a drop of
some shillings the same dav. Since then there has
been a recovery in some measure. A dividend of a
shilling has been declared, payable on July 1.
There was a time when Mount Morgan
moved on, indifferent to what might be said about
it. In those days the price of shares didn’t matter ;
but it is different now. So there are long official
and semi-official statements and explanations and
denials, the last of them being to the effect that no
important changes are contemnlated in the versonnel
of the staff. There was no doubt ,as to the change
that was pending, according to a southern whisper;
and it is, on the whole, very satisfactory to get an
assurance that Magnus, the general manager, is not
to be disturbed lie isn’t the man who has been
rubbing some of the most valuable of the co.’s
officials the wrong way—rubbing them so hard that
a few of them have left.
The shockingly had bargain made bv the
Hampden-Cloneurry (Q.) in the purchase of the Mac-
grego"—-necessitating an increase of £50,000 in the
capital and the re-raising of a heavv debenture loan—
is exhibited in the half-vearlv report to the end of
last February.. The new estimate of ore reserves shows
the contribution from each of the many mines owned
by this company. The Macgregor share is 95,000 tons,
averaging under 7.4 p.c. copper. For this a purchase
prio" of £lOB 750 was paid. Mine development
( £2892) and the expensive tramway scheme—that so
far has run into £51,342, not out —bump the total
to £162,984 to date. So the 95,000 tons will have
to give a net return of about 355. per ton to pre-
vent a loss being made on the deal. They haven't a
hope of doing this; in fact, it is a safe bet that if
the co. attempts to feed only 7.4 p.c. copper ore to
the furnaces, it will add to the loss already made
on the transaction. Of course, the co. won’t face
such a job as this if it can help itself, for it will
sweeten up the furnace mixture with rich ore gouged
from elsewhere. But that will not remove the obli-
gation imposed on the Macgregor ore. Taking the
half-years results, with copper averaging £69 Bs. 7d.
—more than it usually does —the profit was £74,148,
if £B3OO depreciation allowance be shoved out of
sight. The ore treated gave a yield of 10.9 p.c. cop-
per (assay value would be about 11J p.c. copper) ;
and, as 27,746 tons were smelted, the average profit
was £2 13s. sd. per ton. The Macgregor reserves
might yield 7 p.c. copper, though this is doubtful.
Anyway, the profit on 7 p.c. ore is not seven-elevenths
of the profit on 11 p.c. ore—by a long way.
The total list of Hampden ore reserves is not cheer-
ful. Compare it with that of 18 months ago. Then
there were 238,500 tons of ore ready for extraction
from four mines. Since then there have been 70,124
tons treated from these four mints. Now there are
only 241,000 tons in reserve, although 98,000 tons
have been added by the inclusion of the Macgregor
and Answer mines. There ought to be 266,376 tons
—if the odd tons can be sworn to—-even if develop-
ment work in the interval had added nothing to the
reserves. Some severe pruning has evidently been
going on. This pruning orocess, especially when not
admitted, doesn't tend to give confidence in the
existing figures. What has probably happened is that
the 56,000 tons of 5 p.c. copper stuff, formerly in-
cluded as ore reserves in the Duchess, have been
dropped overboard. That being so, the Duchess mine
has developed 27.000 tons in the 18 months, as at
the beginning there were 80.000 tons of high-grade
ore, of which 40,000 tons have since been treated,
leaving 67.000 tons now in hand. Development work
in the interval totalled 1077 ft. The Hampden now
shows 57,000 tons as against the former 88,000,
though only 29,000 tons have since been treated.
The backwardation here is 2000 tons. The pruning
knife can again afford the only explanation. But
unless the pruning was verv severe this mine cannot
have developed anv ore worth speaking of during the
interval. And the development was 2092 ft. There
is something curious somewhere, and an explanation
wouldn’t be amiss.
Mammoth Cooper’s Chieftain mine (N.Q.)
is developing well. In Nos. 1 and 2 levels the
shoots bad a decided trend to the south ; in fact,
more than 500 ft. was driven to the south at the
160 ft. level, and it was the good prospects met with
there that nut the shares up. The south drive at
No 3 level (230 ft. vertical) is in 222 ft., the end
showing 3ft. of ore worth 15 p.c., with no hanging
wall exposed ; and the lode which is being driven
on to the north of the crosscut is developing into a
big ore body, at present Bft. wide Worth 8J p.c.
“Cy”: A twisted construction has bepn
placed on recent pars, about Lode Hill, collusion
between the manager and the market being hinted at.
As a fact, the operator most closely concerned is as
heavy a holder as he was before the last clean-up
was known, having missed the market through his
faith in the property.
The mining of magnesite near Tumb.v Ray
(S.A.) is to be taken in hand bv a syndicate which
hopes to replace the imported magnesite brick, one
of the best materials for lining retorts.
Lake Pernatty Copper (S.A.) is getting
itself touched up in preparation for its introduction
to capital. A trench 120 ft. long by 10ft. wide is
reported to have yielded an average of 34 p.c. to
4 p;e. copner. The odd half p.c is treated in quite
an offhand manner. Depth of trench is 6ft., and there
are some inquisitive people who would like it to be
deeper.
Hindu Choung. Burmali. is a Melbourne-
Oriental tin show. H. W. Booth,' general manager,
puts out a statement of costs that deserves considera-
tion from Malayan tin boomsters. The working time
of the dredge, first of all, is only 60 p.c., the loss
doubtless being due partly to inefficient coolie labor
and partly to sunken timber. Costs are 5Jd. per cub.
yard, and average values amount to only 0.5351 b.
tin per cub. yard. Even this low-grade stuff left a
margin for the Hindu Choung because tin concen-
trates were sold at £124 per ton on a 70 p.c. pro-
duct. With the metal at its present level, that price
iS down another £lO per ton, so that two things
must happen to give profits. Either better ground
has to be reached or expenses have to be pruned.
There’s going to be a rude awakening to
the newer of the Malav States tin shows, which are
understood to average the fashionable 2 Jib. to the yard.
Other people who sampled these shows got an average
of lib., and one Sydney concern is pulling up its
prospecting stakes in Malaya, after turning down
four “concessions” and one Chow who blandly asked
the engineer—“ How muchee you want give welly goo’
report?”
The flotation process has been a gold
mine for the lawyers, who have just had another small
crushing from it. The Ore Concentration Co. had
a long bout in the Courts with the Sulphide Corpora-
tion, and eventually the Privy Council decided that,
though the Ore Concentration Co.’s patent was good,
the Sulphide Corporation wasn’t infringing it. That
meant a verdict for the latter, who now asked that
the taxed costs, which the plaintiffs had paid in,
should be paid out to the defendants —a matter of
£4700, plus costs of the latest application. As far
as can now be seen, the sky is clear from litigation.
Beaconsfield (Tas.) has decided on a
course of slow starvation. The co. will not tackle
the old Tasmanian mine again, and on the reports
of its expert advisers the Governpient will not put
up the money to take the shaft down another lift;
but it has consented to guarantee the co. £5O a
week rent and put in 1000 tons of coal a month, so
that tributors may poke around in the old workings.
The boss will be a Government nominee.
Australian and Maoriland banking figures
for the first three months of 1914 show big move-
ments, especially as regards denosits, advances and
coin and bullion, when compared with the January-
March figures of 1913. Denosits have increased bv
£8 778 812 (from £171.954.381 to £180.733,193),
while advances have decreased by £1,543,213. Idle
coin and bullion in the banks shows a substantial
growth of £6 469.807. This looks very much as
though those who have money to invest are not half
satisfied with the securities offering, and prefer to
leave the cash in the bank until things get a big
quieter.

The maintenance of pulley speed is of great im-
portance. Every pulley in your machinery is de-
signed to run a certain speed, and it is absolutely
necessary that it does, or, naturally, you will not
secure the maximum results. Faulty transmission
belting is an astounding profit-reducer. Pulleys
running half time bring but half-time profits—but
“Pioneer” Leather Belting will end the transmission-
power-profit leaks in your plant by its tight gripping
and non-slipping. The profit-building power of
“Pioneer” Leather Belting goes farther than our
word. Profit building is made into every foot of
the belt. The belts are built on a sure foundation.
None but the centre cuts of the strongest and most
flawless Australian oxhides are used. These, oak-
tanned in our own tannery and’ built uo with best
workmanship, combine to make “Pioneer’*" a thorough

A
WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, May 25, 1914.
My Dear Arini, —
Empire Day made the usual clatter of
infant heels and the annual flutter of bunt-
ing in parks and playgrounds. The juvenile
stomach had fine weather, contrary to Empire
Day custom; so the school child was able
to ‘walk off its plethora of Bun dryshod.
The Exchange seethed with speeches tor
the Cause —speeches that made the
Empire feel rather like a charity, with Kip-
ling passing round the hat to the tune oi
“Lest We Forget.”
The first garden party at Admiralty
House under the Patey regime occurs on
June 3.
Governor Strickland has sent forth invi-
tations for a Birthday dinner on June o,
when the health of George Rex will be men-
tioned over the froth of champagne.
The small, wiry Under-Sec. Just, who is
permanently switched on to every overseas
Imperial conference, is still galloping
through N. S. Wales. After dropping m
from Queensland he broke his fall, so to
speak, at Maitland, and had a lightning-
speed glimpse of local mines. Thence to
Newcastle, where in company with Gover-
nor Strickland he peers into Newcastle’s
harbor works. After giving a festive spread
in this city, the visitor bangs his top-hat
well down on his eyebrows and rushes off
to Melbourne and Tasmania, and later on
to Maoriland. Thence he takes a Canadian
chill, and in the land of the maple-leaf
finishes up this breathless inspection of “the
dominions overseas.” The shadowy form
of the much-travelled Just will probably
blow into a London club in September.
Artist Lister Lister’s attractive water
colors —new work just dry from his brush —
are now on view in Anthony Horderns’ Art
Gallery. Jervis Bay is profusely illus-
trated in stretches of creamy sand, and in
the long, ghostly boles of the white gum
which flourishes in that picturesque district.
Fifty guineas’ worth of paint, catalogued
“The Winding Creek, Berry,” shows the
mothers of the herd laving their feet near
a rushy waterway. “When the Billy Boils”
is a soft green study of a bush picnic for
one, with the great white gum as a leading
feature. “Wreck of the Euroka,” on Long
Reef, makes a sea-breezy picture with a
garnish of salvage-man. Blackheath and
its mists and gullies belong to the Blue
Mountain series, painted during the recent
Lister Lister sketching tour amongst those
indigo-blue hills. Cloud effects chasing the
sunshine across mountain cliffs, and the sea
foaming against Narrabeen cliffs, are likely
to find the pocket of the local buyer. Out
of a fine collection of 54 water-colors only
four have been on view before the present
show.
The tango germ has bitten this town all
over and brought in its wake the milder
fever of the waltz. A few new and compli-
cated species of the hop, not unlike the fren-
zied tarantella, ate also raging in special
locations. At the Imperial Salon on Satur-
day eve the blue-pencilled tango was vigor-
ously danced by our Best People. Every-
body’s doing it! Age is no bar to the new
, dances, which have wonderfully revived the
. gilded youth who formerly propped up the
: >walls of ballrooms till the bearded oyster
stayed their hunger. The marble steps of
fthe Salon the other evening were packed
•with a crowd that looked like a small resur-
rection hurrying along to the crack o’ doom
fin.swallow tails and dancing pumps. Motors
• snorted up and disgorged their human
and the freight immediately disclosed
■the correct tango gait, which consists of hop-
vping along as on hot bricks. Trams dis-
gorged their bustling contingent, too. and the
rimpacb-at the trunstiles was a drawing-room
<fidiitifln o f>f Rugby football in its most crowded
Venerable University Chancellor Mac-
Laurin has not as yet taken to the tango in
public. But other elderly gentlemen, well
over the Psalmist’s time-limit, hopped round
the Salon ballroom as if they were youngsters
bitten by bulldog ants. Dr. Fiaschi. senior,
revolved more slowly in the waltz. The long
athletic figure of Dr. Reuter Roth, a capable
dancer, swirled rapidly round the room. Mrs.
Charlie Wade took a vigorous turn on the
floor, which is as near perfection as anything
of mere timber can be. Mrs. Sep. Levy, five-
feet-nothing in her silk stockings, maintained
a steady attack on the tango. Two tall
figures, Mrs. Geoff. Fairfax and the long,
reed-like Gladys Fuller —both dancers of
Style—floated round in the gorgeous tropic
twilight which is switched on when the band
begins to play. The very young Dr. David
looked on in the sac suit of daily toil—one
a crowd of spectators that swarmed like
bees. The plump hope to grow thin, and the
over-lean look forward to putting on a streak
of fat during the present obsession of revolv-
ing toes.
Australia’s John Longstaff has finished
the portrait of a militia-man named Tun-
bridge—-he is a Lieut.-Col. when he _is in
parade-ground millinery—for the Brisbane
National Gallery.
The Old Salon (Paris) is taking seriously
to the brush work of Commonwealth artists.
Agnes Noyes Goodsir, Justine . Kong Sing,
Charles Bryant, May Butler George, and
Grace Joel are represented this season —-a
fine crop, which is mostly young enough to
build fancy castles in the clouds.
The Bush Book Club held its annual cor-
roboree under the sub-regal roof on a
sloppy afternoon last week. Some of the
meeting was heavily goloshed, and lurked
meekly in the background of the gorgeous
feathered tribe who motored to the fray.
Portion of the company had lost or mis-
laid its invitation card, and retained only
a dazed memory of the hour at which it
w r as expected to arrive. In consequence, a
small gathering began to dribble on to the
Government House doorstep at 3 p.m. As
the pleasure of its presence had pot been
requested till 4 o'clock, it was able to ad-
mire the scenery from the porch, or wearily
stand on one leg like a crane, till it was
offered a chair inside. The Strickland lady-
ship was, later, surrounded by the bustling
dames who mother the scheme. Secretary
Beulah Bolton read the dry-as-dust facts
that bristle to be heard at these gatherings.
Mrs. Harper, wife of the Scotch dominie
at St. Andrew’s College, consumed some
seconds in falling over the title “Your Ex-
cellency” with great slaughter before getting
on the trail of the lonely Frenchman —an
exile in the bush, who has been writing to
express his appreciation of the literature
sent him by the Bush Book Club. Why these
worthy women insist on belaboring Mrs.
State Governor as “Your Ex..” while the
Downing-street official Blue Book goes black
in the face, and Gentleman Helps titter in
their sleeve-links, goodness only knows. How-
ever. having safely passed this hurdle, the
meeting proceeded with some of its busi-
ness —an appeal for more books and more
subscribers. Mr. Arthur Jqse reminded the
gathering that Mrs. Aubrey Withers (who
was present under the shade of new millin-
ery with petunia velvet battlements) Was
the N.S.W. originator of the notion of send-
ing printed matter to the Backblocks. His
pithy anecdote re the ancient swagman he
met on his travels, who was keenly inter-
ested in the Darwin theory of . the missing
link (and had pursued his subject on torn
scraps of papers, etc.), was received in chilly
silence. The Bush Book Club is not mak-
ing the ancestral monkey-man a plank of
its literary - platform. Mrs. Bob MacKin-
non popped up and flung a bouquet at the
bush pioneers. Dr. Grace Boelke proposed
a vote of thanks to the Strickland lady.
Mrs. Pritchard Bassett was just visible
under the drooping brim of a wintry brown
hat, with a fuzzy-wuzzv exterior. 3he
tall Cullen dame looked in at the meeting,
and Lady Patey sank into a humble seat
amongst the herd which was in goloshes and
raincoats. Aide Wallis contributed an
extra chair as his oblation, and carried it
through the assembly to the front, with its
four thin legs kicking in the air. The lonely
Frenchman cropped up at regular intervals,
and a vice-regal black cat, which insisted
on rubbing its whiskers against the ankles
of the best-dressed persons present (the
feline race is instinctively snobbish), was
firmly thrown out by the blue-eyed Eldest
Daughter, Mary.
Another hole was made last week in the
ranks of the clan of the Lees, of Bathurst.
Harold Traill, who then dropped out, had
married one of the George Lee daughters.
The Traill father was a Western squatter
too. This Traill son 30-odd years ago de-
cided to go in the Lands instead of on the
land, and was ever after in the Survey
branch. But he was much too well off (he
belonged to the Union Club and was re-
putedly the wealthy member of a service
which isn’t millionairish) and much too
happy in his fine suburban garden at Bur-
wood to look for preferment out among the
saltbush and the mulga, where preferment
in the Lands Department is usually picked
UP-
An interesting young Australian who
promised to be a valuable old Australian
died in the United States lately. When
automatic telephones came this way the
Standard-Waygood engineering people, who
own the principal patents in Australia,
selected two of its bright young men to go. to
America and spend three years in learning
all about them. The youths chosen were
Bennett, of one of the Evening News Ben-
nett families, and Deck, of the family which
mostly supplies doctors and medical mis-
sionaries. They were reported to be doing
fine work, and had put in about half their
time, when a cable came telling that young
Deck was seriously ill with a septic throat
and another followed on its heels announc-
ing the young engineer’s death.
In order to break into that bore-
dom which evidently haunts the Simple
Life, an English demonstration in
Wordsworth’s district was to have taken
place two or three weeks ago.. The thrills
were to include fording a rapid river, get-
ting lost in a mountain mist, “enjoying a
severe thunderstorm (weather permitting),
climbing a chimney, and dangling over a
precipice. Breakfast by sunrise was thrown
in as an extra.
Still another benefit concert. The Royal
Hospital for Women (Paddington) and the
Renwick Hospital for Infants are clamor-
ing for raore cash. ■ (This clamor is getting
louder than a dinner gong and quite, as fre-
quent.) Mrs. Earp will be the chief bell-
ringer at a meeting in Queen Victoria Club
before this reaches you; and all and suridry
will be roped in, without prejudice, to help
the Cause.
Mrs. Mayoress 'Richards presided at the
first flutter of the committee which hopes
to snare a fat cheque for the Mater Miseri-
cordise Hospital for Women and Children,
North Sydney. The usual ball—a hardy
annual—will be the medium used.
The late Sir Hubert von Herkomer, who
was so enthusiastic about the ability of
Sydney’s gifted wood-sculptor, Ruth Ban-
nister, was a man of many accomplish-
ments. Artist, actor, film-maker, musician,
architect, teacher, etcher, lie was too ver-
satile to succeed early in life. He hawked
his drawings round London till liis persist-
ence gradually broke down the prejudice
against a style that was too original to
appeal to a conservative British public.
Yet, after all, his name came into promi-
nence through his picture of a conventional
subject:. “Chelsea Pensioners in Church.”
When, he jumped into fame all his personal
foibles were moulded into the environment
of his beautiful home at Bushey. “To see
the gates swing open unbidden, and to motor
to, the door to the welcoming tones of an
organ, was like entering a modern fairy-
land,” said a Herkomerite.
Miss Hall-Jones, a daughter of Maori-
land’s ex-High Commissioner, is over here
on a visit.
Artist Thea Proctor will leave for the
grey Northland some time next month.
Chelsea, habitat of artists, will be her head-
quarters. A sturdy Australian colony, by
the way, is springing up in the neighbor-
hood where once the dyspeptic Carlyle took
his daily airing.
So many lies and inventions are thrust
upon the public concerning any man or
woman who gets into the limelight that I
send you the following rumor with a ton of
■ salt. Somebody told somebody else that
Amy Castles had dissolved or relinquished
her operatic engagements for a course of
vocal study under Hazon in Italy.
Unless legal complications occur, Bruce
Smith, M.H.R., and his sister, Mrs. Ger-
trude Innes Noad, have come into a fat
slice of fortune apiece, under the will of
the late E. E. Smith, of the Howard Smith
shipping firm. There seems to be a good
deal of Smith in this glad-tiding of great
cash (the late E.E. left altogether about
quarter of a million of money), there being
many other legatees, of the name who will
also hold out their hands for more.
Dorothea Spinney’s illuminating recital
of Irish plays drew a satisfactory audience
to the Repertory Theatre on a weepful,
wintry night. A serious instalment of ’Var-
sity folk unwound their learned necks out
of yards of furry comforters, and had a
brisk argument about the size of the gallery
seats. Stout ladies insisted on trying to
pull them out, refusing to believe that they
were built for the fashionable figure which
can sit on the side of an egg-slice without
inconvenience. When the Worst was rea-
lised, they squatted dismally on the narrow
Repertory ledges and saw the performance
through without falling flat on their faces.
Miss Louisa Macdonald, who moulds the
Women’s College damsel into a ’Varsity
trencher-board, and Mrs. B. R, Wise, small
and slender enough for the artistic gallery
perch, sat down carefully near the Consett
Stephen dame. Plump friends who moved
uneasily on the edge of next-to-nothing
came along to pay their respects in the
intervals. The alert Miss Dumolo, of the
Kindergarten training-college, and Mrs.
Ashburton Thompson were firmly wedged in
their small cubic space till the end of the
show. The majestic presence of Mrs. Laura
Bogue Luffman was mercifully shrined in
a stall seat of reasonable -size. Lawrence
Godfrey Smith and the lean David Maughan
couple were also stalled in seats that almost
moved fat persons who were poised in the
gallery-to tears of envy.
Dorothea Spinney has a long willow-wand
figure and a melodious voice. She was
particularly clever in the second of the
Yeats playg, “Kathleen Hulahan.” Kath-
leen is the spirit of Ireland. As the recital
wore on to the germ of the play—“those who
love me must give me their lives” —one saw
the Yeats idea of the distressful Isle beauti-
fully handled, Kathleen is an allegorical
spirit, not bitter or revengeful, but sorrow-
ful and inclined to passionately hug past
woes to her heart. The Spinney arms are
long and thin, and make emotional circles
in the air with weird dramatic effect.
Contralto Geraldine Ward flings her bag-
gage aboard a craft bound for London on
June 10. She goes to join the Quinlan Co.
In spite of rumors to the contrary, the bust-
ling Quinlan is still revolving round the
globe with tons of operatic scenery, and the
Sydney girl will join his perambulating
aviary. Miss Ward’s recent concert in St.
James’s Hall brought her a comforting
cheque which speeds her flight.
The Boys’ Brigade, which respectfully re-
minds you it was founded in 1882, holds its
annual meeting on June 1. Hon sec. Ste-
phen mentions afternoon tea as a lure to the
thirsty. The gathering will be in the
Brigade premises, Surry Hills, at 3 p.m.,
with Mayor Richards in the chair.
The Balmain Baby Show, in which the
weight, number of teeth, lung power, ability
to stand, and general intelligence were
carefully noted by the judge, has now re-
tired to yell on the domestic hearth. The
judge, Dr. Stopford, who is also an autho-
rity on bulldogs, may need the help of his
prize pups later on to preserve him from
the wrath of infuriated mothers whose dar-
lings didn’t win anything but an incidental
spanking during the competition in juvenile
brawn.
Purses of sovereigns are still making their
joyful clink heard in this township. _ Law-
rence Campbell, who has been teaching the
Young Idea of Sydney how to throw recita-
tions off its chest for the last 20 years, had
one of these tokens of regard thrust into
his keeping the other night. Premier Hol-
man handed over the cash on behalf of a
large assembly, in St. James’s Hall. The
Campbell voice has been so often uplifted
in stirring recitations on behalf of charity
that the company intimated it was only
giving him back a little bit of his own, in
recognition of his services.
The Olympic Ball was a peaceful affair,
which, so far as I know, left the committee
in a beneficent state of mind, and called
forth no barks or bites from the gallery
patrons. Mrs. Boult arranged the living
statuary, and daughter Queenie tripped
round in fancy dances before the ball opened
with a fancy-dress pageant. Our world s-
champion girl swimmer, Fanny Durack,
made a fine, healtliy-looking mermaid, with
her hair fuzzed out and her form swathed
in glittering eel-like drapery, with a neat
fish-tail attachment. Mrs. Joseph Car-
ruthers’s set, “Archery,” was one of the best
attempts at looking like the thing you said
you were. Mr, D. D. Mclntyre’s Surfing
set was also obvious to the youngest intel-
ligence. The Amateur Fishermen’s Associa-
tion (N.S.W.) was so close to nature that
it gave a realistic representation of Grand-
pa Lobster (after he had blushed a beauti-
ful red in the cooking-pot), Cousin Prawn,
Uncle Salmon and a Flying Gurnard. The
girls who twirled round with these exhibits
were exactly like the fancy portraits of
Scotch fish wives. Doris Herman’s Cours-
ing” set delayed the flashlight photo, for a
second while the greyhounds were warned
that they must not sit down suddenly in
the middle of having their pictures taken.
“Sealed Orders,” with all its baggage, has
moved over the border to Melbourne. In
the co. is a bright Victorian girl, Lea Halin-
bourg, who has been playing small parts,
or understudying in the offing, with a pro-
spect of reaching the centre of the stage
and a spot light when she’s had more ex-
perience.
The small, alert pianist, Pintel, who toured
these latitudes with Calv 6, has returned to
Sydney. He threatens to settle down here-
abouts, and join the overmanned, and still
more overwomanned, teaching trade m a city
where the wails of the superfluous piano
make night hideous.
Boyd Wells, the pianist who was with
Dolores during a previous tour, will step
off the Sonoma to join the dark-eyed lady
in her forthcoming concert season. Dolores
opens her Australian song-burst on June 6
in our Town Barn.
The Artists’ Ball, which is fathered by the
Roval Art Society, will swing round the
Paddington Town Hall this week.
Paling’s forward a song with the glitter-
ing title, “Britannia’s Jewels.” The music,
by Aug. W. Juncker, carries verse by G.
Herbert Gibson (“Ironbark”). It is dedi-
cated to our baby navy, and has a chorus
which you are requested to sing ‘boldly, as
it relates to the Lion’s cub who roars by
the shores of seven seas.”
The Attstbalian Medical Gazette,
which has its head office in this settlement,
is coming under the control of Dr. H. W.
Arnit, of London. He ought to be nearing
these shores very soon.
The April orgy of race festivities and
the columns of ink spilt over the dresses
of the women folk who paraded their glad
rags at Rand wick reminds me of a queer
specimen of the journalists’ craft in the
days of GoveTnor Macquarie. After a three-
days’ race-meeting in Hyde Park and two
balls, a scribe of the day, dilating on the
beauty and fashion present, said: “A supper
followed the ball. After the cloth was re-
moved the rosy deity asserted his pre-emin-
ence, and with the zealous aid of Momus
and Apollo chased pale Cynthia into the
Western World. The blazing orb of day
announced his near approach, and the god
of the chariot reluctantly forsook his com-
pany. Bacchus dropped his head. Momus
could no longer animate.” Which meant as
the late John Arthur Barry said, a very wet
night indeed, and no one with much less
than three bottles under his belt at day-
light. I was so much impressed by the
style that I asked the editor if he would
like the present letter written in the same
lofty and symbolical strain. He replied,
with suppressed emotion, that he would try
to struggle along without it.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, May 25, 1914.
My Dear Yarrie. —
Once more Empire Day lias tottered past,
the drapers have made a few odd shillings by
selling the Grand Old Flag in cheap, flimsy
editions, and the suffering school-kid, who
nowadays provides everybody with a docile
audience, has stood by, very ill at ease, while
“’ls Wership th’ Mare” has ill-treated the
English language as he wouldn’t dare to
ill-treat his horse. But, judging by the way
the youngsters talk amongst themselves, re-
tribution has its boots on, and is well on its
way. In a few years’ time, when the present
generation of youngsters is grown up, the
stumbling, ignorant, ungrammatical speaker
will be hooted off the stump by impatient
adult listeners who got too much Empire Day
oratory in their youth to want any more of it
in their lusty manhood. 1 looked over a
school fence to-day (Monday) while a few
hundred weary youngsters were bliLliered at
in turn by several full-grown men who should
have been at work. You would have thought,
my dear, that all Australia’s urgent jobs
had been done, the National Debt paid oil,
and the blessed old Empire made perfectly
secure. Attentive as a well-trained dog at
the edge of the futile group stood a suburban
reporter, greedily shorthanding the nonsense.
If I had had any spare powder with me, I
would have wept for the profession ; but, as
there was no powder left in the vanity box,
I simply couldn’t manage it.
The Australian Women’s National “Leg”
gave an Empire Day demonstration in the
Town Hall on Saturday night. Everything
that wasn’t purple and gold was red, white
and blue. (No! The oratory was a plain,
dull brown.) The packed hall reeked of
Pecksniflian respectability —mostly in beaded
black bonnets and smug smiles, representing,
I presume, Virtue and Loyalty Triumphant.
Mrs. President Hughes, in militant black
jet and foolish nodding feathers, harangued
the gathering or boil-over in a flat voice;
and Iceberg Irvine, who had just come from
something equally useless in the House,
intoned the word “Empire” TOO times.
The row of political squaws lining
the edge of the platform tried to conceal the
toy Union Jacks which they were dying to
wave when the orchestra sawed off some
national airs, and young women tied up in
purple-and-yellow sashes shrieked blue-
mouldy ballads. Quantities of police
guarded every door —I suppose to keep live
people out.
The little Stanley lady, escorted by her
Governor-husband, christened the fourth
new motor ambulance-waggon of the St.
John’s Association last Thursday afternoon.
President Dr. Springthorpe and the council
of the Victorian Centre summoned a select
band of the patrons, the Felton Bequest
trustees, the Mawson Fund ditto and the
Gaud Mayor to the new premises at the top-
end of Swanston-street, where Enid Spring-
thorpe, in brown, with blue facings and a
flush of nervousness, presented a bouquet of
pink roses to her Ex. There was a lot of
juggling with this trophy. First of all, her
Ex. passed it over to Help Gale; later on
she took it back and tried to hide it in the
new waggon. It was promptly retrieved by
some watchful bystander, and various
people chased her with it for the rest of the
afternoon. Finally a breathless official, who
thought he was being original, caught her
up and pressed the posy into her hand just
as she was escaping through the door.
The Munro-Ferguson couple have no
family of their own, so niece Doris Black-
wood has been brought along to have a good
time and act as daughter to Aunt Helen.
Local Society loses a notable personality
by the death of Mrs. Payne, widow of the
late Captain Bradley Payne, R.N. The
gallant Cap. was commander of the old Nel-
son, which ship he navigated to Australian
waters. The Paynes owned a fine house in
South Yarra, and were in the forefront of
the Best, for the husband, long deceased,
was a cousin to the Marquis of .Normanby,
an old-time Governor of Victoria. Time
gallantly stood back for his widow, who
retained her charm to the last. Her late
father, Lieutenant Simmons, of the British
Army, held an official billet in Tasmania in
the bad old broad-arrow days.
Pianist Leonard Borwick has been collect-
ing fat houses which come to hear the mas-
terful music he makes and to watch him
doing it. At the Auditorium, one night
last week, the applause was so violent when
a gum-leaf laurel wreath was handed up
that one of the chairs collapsed under the
strain, the arm-rest falling with a dull thud
into the aisle. If the sitter had broken his
or her neck, it would have been regarded as
a graceful tribute, and the body might have
been handed up along with the chair rem-
nants. The vice-regal Stanleys were at the
Thursday night recital, and many of the
Best Fed were noticeable amongst the
purely musical fanatics. With my field
classes I picked out the Robertson clan. Miss
Brookes, the Henry Cave dame and the
Colin Templetons. And, of course, every
Melbourne being who owns a soul had
brought it along to be fed.
During last week wild reports went round
that some of the pictures in the rather
dreadful Victorian Artists’ show had been
wilfully and maliciously damaged or im-
proved. Regarding the identity of the van-
dal, you had three guesses; it was (1) a
disappointed brush-wfelder who hadn’t been
hung, (2) a lover of real art, or (3) a wan-
dering British suffragette. Everyone won-
dered if the hurried impressionist additions
had improved the canvases much. It was a
splendid advt. for the show, but the curious
ones who rushed to see had their tram-ride
for nothing. All traces of the unauthorised
brush had been removed while the paint was
still wet, and the pictures remained not a
splash the better for the interference of the
jealous rival, or the angry aesthete, or the
demented daughter of foreign politics who-
ever it Was that did the deed.
Passed hence last Saturday Richard
Goldsbrough Row, son of Fred Row, both
of them well known in wool circles all over
Australia. “Dick” had suffered for some
time from gout, but otherwise had not been
ailing long. He was executor and one of
the heirs of Richard Goldsbrough, who may
justly be called the pioneer of the wool trade
in Melbourne, and gained his wide know-
ledge of wool as ,an expert in Goldsbrough’s
employment. His first wife was Nellie
Stewart, from whom he parted soon after
their marriage. For the rest he was a
thorough good sport and an exceptionally
clever billiard player ; owned racehorses for
years, till he discovered that more
dependence had to be placed on his trainer
and jockey than on his horse; and to the
end was a member of the V.A.T.C. A.
burly, handsome man, with a heart as big
as his head.
Una Bourne has been doing very nicely in
England since Melba brought the tall, slim
Melbournienne into notice as a soloist at
some of her concerts. Last week she played
on a Buckingham Palace piano before the
Queen and other members of the Family
circle. It was on “Empire” Day that the
musical audience was graciously granted.
If the suffragettes’ assault on the Palace
was occurring at the time, her Majesty pro-
bably urged the pianist to play as loud as
possible and drown the screeches of the
wounded.
The equality of the sexes is fully recog-
nised at Pentridge. As the result of Harry
Lauder’s recent visit to the male side of the
establishment, Daisy Jerome and “a party
of actresses” gave an entertainment to the
Women’s Penitentiary last week. Two State
motor-cars conveyed the festive crowd to the
dismal sphere of action, but no details of
the performance have leaked into print thus
far. Lydies in enforced retirement are not
generally supposed to hanker after the kind
patronage of their hobble-skirted sisters.
During a recent seaside dance a local
matron denounced the modern girl’s habit
of using the kerbstone as a sitting-out place.
“My girls would never be so middle-class!”
she proclaimed, and her hearers shuddered
and said that of course they wouldn’t. Just
then in came one of the girls, demurely
modest and apparently unconscious of an
immense black streak on the sitting-down
part of her frock. The fond parent and a
number of solicitous friends rushed to in-
vestigate, and the horrible truth was gradu-
ally revealed. The black mark was the
print of the front doorstep, which some
local wag had carefully smeared with
treacle. The unfortunate girl-victim is now
known in the district as “the" treacle tart.”
Mrs. Edwin James, with her widowed
daughter, Mrs. Neill, and a brace of grand-
children, came back from London lately with
return tickets in their peggy bags. They
are keeping the moths at bay at Ardoch,
the Alawa Buchanans’ place on Dandenong-
road, what time the owners are inspecting
Europe. The young Neill widow has un-
packed some lovely frocks, which she wears,
one at a time, at the exact angle appointed
by a kindly but fastidious Providence.
Alex., only son of Dr. Steven, will be re-
membered as having wound up a brilliant
University career with a book of poems;
after which he took his muse to browse on
the meadows of England. He has just been
convicted of publishing another volume of
verse entitled “Wind on the Wold.”
(“Wold,” you know, is a harmless old Anglo-
Saxon term for uncultivated land. When
the land comes under cultivation it changes
its name to “weald.” seemingly. A picture
in Melbourne National Gallery is called “The
Weald of Kent.”) Master-poet John Mase-
field says the stuff is good, so young Alex,
is throwing out his chest so far that it is
obstructing the traffic. Did I mention that
he is six feet high? Well, he is. and he can
write poetry ivith one hand tied behind him.
Kathleen Watson Dearden has a big bone
to pick with Gregan McMahon, boss of the
Repertory Theatre. Gregan was “stuck”
for a curtain-raiser when he nroduced A If
Buchanan’s “The Tmnge Breaker.” on the
recent Australian Night at St. Peter’s Hall.
Something went wrong with the curtain-
raiser which had been advertised; so at the
last moment he “rang in” the first act, or a
condensation of the first act, of a play that
Mrs. Dearden had confided to him. This
mutilated fragment ended in a vague note of
interrogation, and the why and the where-
fore of it were not even suggested.
“Adrift” deserves a full production and a
fair chance before the year is out. But
why not change the title to “Ursula,” the
story in Kathleen Watson’s “Later Litan-
ies,” from which it was adapted?
One more Repertory Bali story —the sort
of story that one always hears after the event.
A girl whose get-up comprised bare feet and
sandals was troubled about a mole on the
offside ankle, but finally got over the difficulty
with a coquettish black patch. It was_ a
cute idea, hut it escaped general notice
because the social reportress hasn’t yet been
discovered who will painstakingly circle a
hall on her hands and knees and faithfully
chronicle the feet of those present. I for one
would never do it. It wouldn’t suit me.
This, dear sister, is an extract from a
critical soldier’s article in Melbourne Age
on General Hamilton’s report on the Austra-
lian militarv system:—
Senator Millen, during Jiis Masonic Hall speech to
the militia officers, said: “Too much haste is the
enemy of speed.”
And Hamilton used it before Millen. Why
make a clumsy, eight-word, paraphrase of tße
concise, four-word “More hurry, less speed”?
And yet men say we are the talkative sex.
The Best People now go nuqierously to
the Palais de Danse, so the ice at the Glaci.
isn’t as crowded as it used to be. The
Frank Madden daughters remain faithful,
and the Macgillicuddy flapper, who has
turned up her back hair, still cuts graceful
figures. The Dalrymple youth, who used to
squire Billie Clegg before she became Mrs.
Simon Eraser, jun., is also constant to the
rink. Chaperones are protesting with care-
fully-shocked hiccoughs at a skater who
wears a cerise garter and a skirt which is
slit past the knee-limit. Otherwise there
is nothing much doing, and it’s really very
cold and expensive.
There is to be another Pierrot Ball this
year. The frolic is to happen at the South
Yarra Plaza on June (!, the big Bendigo
mining accident being thd charitable Excuse.
The Athenaeum is sheltering ''a collection
of colored ehalkings by Mary, Dorcas Byrne,
a young artist from Rome. Philistines and
newspaper people would call them pastels,
but Mary has christened them “Lapis col-
orati.” The chalks are used with a
light touch on stone-colored paper. Among
other things they have /produced capi-
tal portraits of Archibald Strong, musician
Goll, Ada Reeve and Gregan McMahon.
The Medical Students held their annual
revel in the St. Kilda Town Hall last Friday.
The Students are all carefully-desperate fel-
lows accustomed to mad, shandygaff orgies ;
but they manage to tame themselves to the
two-step limit once a year, to give the women
a treat. About 300 came along, including
many pretty young nurses who, of course,
are much too devoted to their chosep profes-
sion to ever think of marriage,. Dr. Grosse,
the lively little medicine woman, looked
youthful in pink and mauve and a frivolous
manner. When one-step tunes broke out
the couples on the floor drew deep breaths
and started to teach each other the tango
steps they knew —or thought they knew.
The pride of the whole party was a gorgeous
medicated youth in white socks, which are
understood to be quite as tragically wicked
in their way as skirts slit to the waist. The
impropriety of white socks is in the fact that
they call attention to the ankles.
“Make way for a fainting lady!”
squeaked a diminutive Gentleman Help, as
•he pushed aside the struggling mass of
fashionables waiting on the porch steps after
a recent big function. _ The crowd im-
mediately divided ; but, instead of the Faint-
ing lady, out came the bright lad, followed
by four smiling females who showed no
signs of distress whatever. If the duped
guests had not been fairly well brought up
the cockerel and his four hens might have
been severely hustled.
The Melbourne Dental Students are giving
a fang-dance in the St. Kilda Town Hall on
Wednesday, June 24. Teeth, I suppose, will
be extracted free of charge before _ nine
o’clock, and as regards any girl who gives a
student a sitting-out, it will be understood
that she is having her gums tested.
From my Adelaide correspondent
The S.A.J.C. Autumn Meeting was a somewhat
depressed function despite the cheerful weather. The
death of the Chief Justice’s ladv cast a gloom oyer
the proceedings, and the arrival of the Otway with
the Munro-Fergusons on hoard kept Government
House away—and, as you know, mv dear, the absence
of Government House means the non-attendance of
many Government Housers. However I identified Mrs.
Robert Hope, the Hylands, the A. J. and the H. P.
McLachlans, Mrs. Alan Bowman, Mrs. Roy Burston
and her sister, and Mrs. Driscoll, so all was not lost
utterly.
Mrs. Culross, who has taken the Fishers’ house in
North Adelaide for the. winter, gave a dance last
week She and her eldest daughter were in black. On
the other hand, Miss Joanna Culross inhabited maize-
colored satin overlaid with ninon drapings. Amongst
the 50 or so folks who ragged, one-stepped, waltzed
and even attempted to tango wefe Miss Margaret
Hughes, in white with a smart dash of black at the
waist; Miss Burston and her sister, both of Mel-
bourne ; Miss Poulton, in a soft admixture of grey
and pink; Mrs. Roy Burston and Miss McFarlane.
Alice Grant Rosman’s novel, “Miss Bryde of Eng-
land,” will be published in August by Andrew Mel-
rose, of London. Where she scores is in getting a
publication date fixed. Barabbas, the typical pub-
lisher, has a habit of paying on publication—and
then delaying that publication for a year or more.
And occasionally the ruffian doesn’t pay even then.
The H. C. Caves have sold their station at Second
Valley to one of the Law Smiths. This, one Of the
prettiest places near Adelaide, is part of the old
Delamere estate, which used to belong to the Sells
and which was split up some time ago. The Sells
still own the southern portion and keep the original
name.
Mortimer Giles, who died at the North Adelaide
Hospital on Sunday, had been in the Government
service for close on half a century. He began as a
surveyor, and rose ultimately to the dizzy altitude
of Registrar-General of Deeds, and Registrar of
Building Societies. His wife, a daughter of the late
Mr. Justice Andrews, died some years ago.
Among the passengers by the Otway were Captain
Napier, his wife and a small daughter. The mother
of the latter was Captain Napier’s first wife, and she
was a George Riddoch. The family party or troupe
were met in Adelaide by Mr. Riddoeh, and went
with him to his station, Koorine, in the south-east on
Monday.
The hungry poor to the number of about 30 were
fed at Government House on Thursday evening. ft
would have done your heart good to see the needy
visitors attack the good things that were so gener-
ously provided for them. It is this sort of kindly
ceremony that helps one to realise that blood is indeed
thicker than water, and that effectively keeps the
Empire from bursting. Amongst those who partook
of the hospitality of our Sovereign’s representative
were the Lance Stirlings, the Langdon Bonythons, the
W. Popes, the Arthur Waterhouses and their daugh-
ter, and the Alan McFarlanes. On Wednesday ot
next week the Governor goes to Port Pirie, and he
has arranged to stop for a day at Petersburg on
the way back.
The annual show of the Adelaide School of Arts
raged furiously on Thursday, Friday and. Saturday.
Needlework, of an unimpeachable class, wood-carving,
beaten-copper work and China painting were all on
exhibit. Bv the way, Mr. H. P. Gill, the School s
director, who is absent on sick leave, writes from
England that he is much better, and that he and
Mrs. Gill, will return to Australia next spring. They
were planning a trip to Cornwall at the time of
writing. .
Mrs. : C. H. Hussey, who died suddenly on Satur-
day, came to South Australia in the Florencia in
’49, and spent her life in the southern part of the
State, except for a few years in the ’7o’s, when her
husband was employed by the late G. F. Ahgas to
administer learning to the families of his employees
on one of his northern stations. He abandoned peda-
gogy in due course, and became the House of Assem-
bly representative for Encounter Bay—now merged
into the district of Alexandra.
Tours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

“.Esculapius”: In ancient Greece they used to
erect temples over natural springs and give to each
a titular diety. We moderns are no less appreciative
of the healthful virtues of a mineral water —only our
methods differ somewhat. For instance, up at the
famous Helidon Spring, the water is secured just as
it bubbles up from the earth, and hermetically sealed
until the process of aeration and bottling is com-
plete. You don’t need a Greek fineness of palate to
appreciate the cool charm of Helidon Spa—it has
the same delicious refreshingness to Billjim as to the
Earl of Hopetoun. As a blender with wines and
spirits, too, it gives just that added snap and
sparkle that counts so much in the sum of pleasant-
ness. You’ll be wise to always make it a practice to
“Figaro”: Read a par. here the other week about
Nature planting the giant stinging nettle in N.Q.,
but close beside it the tree whose leaves serve as an
antidote to its sting. This provision of Nature is
in no way unique, for, just as she curses us with
indigestion so she blesses us with Helidon Spa.
After dining out you’ll have no next mo.rning head-
ache if you take a bottle of “Helidon” before turning
in—this delicious mineral water is Nature’s gift to
those who have dined not wisely but too well. A single
glass will dissolve the undigested food and at ; the
same time ensure a perfect night’s rest. Quite dpart
from its health aspect, “Helidon” greatly enhances
the flavor of wines and spirits—so truly the way of
wisdom is always to
SPLIT IT WITH

HE WAS RIGHT.
THE EJECTED TEUTON: "Rush Inn? I vas
call him (hie) der push out.”
“Ginger”: I am with “Pickhandle” in
every sentence of his onslaught on the poison cart
(B. 30/4/’l4). The poison cart is working a curse
on Australia, and is an abomination that shouldn’t
be tolerated for 48 hours. Besides destroying our
unique types of bird life it deals out indiscriminate
death to the fauna, and is evolving a new and
aggressive kind of venomous fly that is to be feared.
Last summer three deaths from flybite came under
my notice. It is also producing a new breed of
poison-proof rabbit, that can put itself outside more
poison than a confirmed arsenic eater. The flesh of
that rabbit is not safe eating. The bushmen recognise
the poison-eating- bunny by the sickly white pallor
of its flesh, which is as hard as a board. Billjim
avers, moreover, that a scratch from the poison-fed
bunny is often the parent of tetanus. Lastly, the
station-hand, whose billet it is to prepare the poison,
faces inevitable sickness. And there’s no Work-
men’s Compensation Act for that bloke. If “Pick-
handle” brought his Winchester over to this side of
ltiverina he would find the inspector and the local
John Hop quite as officious as they are at the spot
where he has pitched his 6xB. Yet I’ve seen Clar-
ence Bullswool, the squatter, climb into his car,
motor out to the back of the run, and shoot 45 emus
in one afternoon. His exploit was the talk of the
town that night, and well it might be, for £ 450
worth of fines hung on his afternoon’s sport. Sum-
mon him! I don’t think. Squatters are not sum-
moned in station towns.
“Oimai”: “Gamada,” in a recent Bulle-
tin, refers to a strange vine, the root of which is
used by some of the Papuan peoples as an intoxi-
cant. The herb in' question is an old friend, the
Piper Methysticum of the wiseheads, better known as
“kava,’ and under that name made famous by Louis
Becke and others. The preparation and drinking of
this South Sea germicide is in some places (Samoa,
for instance) elevated almost to the dignity of a
ritual. Details of preparation vary, but mastication
of the root, as a preliminary, seems to be universal.
Though Piper Meth., etc., grows all over Papua, it
is only used as a gloom dispeller in the extreme
west. Its leaves, in conjunction with lime, are used
by betel-chewers all over Papua. “Gamada,” or
kava, is the real, genuine tanglefoot. He who loads
up therewith has as much -chance of walking as a
French trader has of entering the Presbyterian Para-
dise.
* * * *
A magistrate with some of Solomon’s
wisdom concealed about him has been discovered in
the vicinity of Tokatoka (M.L.). The other day
six employees of a road contractor in that district
were run in for working horses that were covered
with sores and in poor condition. The wise beak
fined them 20s. each, and costs, and then looked
round the court and wanted to know where the
contractor was. Later in the day that individual
was introduced, and, after being told by the Man
On Top that he was really responsible for the in-
human treatment of the nags, he was invited to
shell out £2O and costs, otherwise the cold quod
would swallow him for 14 days and nights. When
the fainting capitalist had been brought round he
gasped that he didn’t know the horses were being
worked; but he was frigidly told that that protest
only made his crime worse.
“P.X.” : Two years ago, as I don’t expect
anybody to remember, I again met ray old friend,
the common or blood-sucking variety of leech, and
introduced him to The Bulletin. The imp they
call uric acid was playing around my eyes, and
making such a commotion that there was nothing
for them to do but pull down the shutters and
close the shop. It was soon after this that the
doctor, who called the game iritis, put professional
jealousy under his heel and said we could try
leeches. Now, it is all very well when,
having captured your leech at the chem-
its’s (which in these days of modern
surgery isn’t so easy), the little beast
does his work without any fuss ; but when
he sniffs at you, and has to be coaxed to
do that much by the enticement of a
smear of milk, and when the disgusting
little worm even then turns you down,
you begin to feel of very little conse-
quence in the scheme of tilings. I had
had that experience twice; and when the
imp started his play again, and hauled
me up in Tasmania as I was fleeing
north, and asked me what was the hurry,
I heard them mention leeches with the
dread of another painful snub in store.
But I didn’t know the Tasmanian leech.
When he arrived and the usual prepara-
tions were made to encourage him to
start work, he scented a breakfast from
afar and got to it at once. There was no
playing with his meal. Tasmania, he
seemed to realise, is a hungry place for
those who don’t care for apples, and it
doesn’t pay to be too fastidious. I never
met people who seemed to enjoy the
menu quite so well as those Launceston
worms. They arched their backs and
went through every course. It was really
a most unequal contest with the little
imp who was playing his horrible game
inside my eyeball. Gradually the en-
gorged blood-vessels were drained, and so
the breath of life was squeezed ont of
him. After being turned down by one
worm after another, you don’t know how
'he appreciation of another worm or
two can buck you up. I spoke to the doctor
about it afterwards and asked him if he could explain
it. “My dear fellow,” he said, “the influence of
the human being' on the lower animals is remark-
able. You are a tourist from the mainland, remem-
ber, and the leech is a Tasmanian.”
“Charging like a bull at a gate” is an
obsolete figure of speech. The up-to-date expres-
sion is “a bull at a football match.” Down at Clay-
ton (Vic.) the other Saturday the local football
team had to run for their lives ; likewise the opposing
team and 300 spectators fled precipitately from a
bull that had • broken its moorings and was fairly
mad. The Claytons were gorgeous in new light-red
jerseys and red stockings—first time on —and the
bull resented the insult to his color sense. He
chased the players to their dressing-room, smashed
the door in and bellowed like the whole population
of Bashan at the hundred people who had jammed
themselves into the 12ft. square space. Given a
doorway wide enough to admit the body behind his
bellow, John Bull would have done wonders for the
undertaking trade in Clayton. The besieged garri-
son threw bodts, footballs and furniture at the
enemy’s head, but he merely renewed his efforts to get
in. Women even implored him to go away. He
bellowed all the more. At last, his keeper arrived
and manoeuvred him back to captivity. Has any
scientist ever tried to explain why a bull objects so
violently to the color of Daisy Jerome’s hair? Did
the bull that entered the Ark go mad when Mrs.
Noah wore a red blouse?
STARVING.
Is beer food? This question exercised the minds of members of the Board of Health yesterday.
Some doubt was raised as to whether beer could be classified as a food. —Melbourne paper.
TATTERED PERCY: “For Gorsake give us a pint o' beer. I ain’t 'ad nothin' to eat
for three days."
“Pickhandle”: “Moana” (B. 30/4/T4)
has never been in Tassy, or he would include the
inhabitants of the Fly Speck in his category as
muttonbird-eaters. They are stocked by most of the
country stores, packed in barrels from Phillip Island,
Western Port Bay, and other islands in Bass Straits.
The first mutton-bird that insulted my palate dates
back 20 years ago. I heard that they fried it by
placing it in a red-hot pan to sizzle in its own fat.
If any Abo-liar doesn’t desire to acquire the taste
for fried mutton-bird, let him cook them that way.
The proper treatment is to put a frying-pan on the
fire three-parts full of fat. When bubbling well,
plank down your mutton-bird and you’ll find a well-
flavored dish. Two are a pretty solid feed.
“Lagani-Namo” : The Santa-Cruz natives,
instead of the disc shell currency of other Melanesian
islands, have feather money. Red and yellow feathers
of certain birds are gummed in alternate, closely
overlapping lines to a length of fine fibre webbing.
The mint is run by the villages at the northern end
of the island. As the feathers wear off in circulating
among other natives the makers buy them back at a
proportionate discount, and refeather the gaps up to
standard value. To obtain the fluffy money material
“boys” set snares and spread a vegetable “stick-
fast” in likely places, disguise themselves with shrub-
bery, and decoy the particular birds with bogus
calls. As they’re caught they’re put in a wicker cage
or tied to a stick and taken away to be plucked of
their money feathers. After which they’re released.
Young birds are kept if need be until their feathers
are long enough to use. The natives on the several
islands of this group are wonderfully artistic. One
bright mind amongst them invented an ingenious
loom, nobody knows how long ago, which they still
use. They’ve a sort of garfish in these waters that
cannot be caught in nets, so the Cruzians make a
kite of split pandanus leaves, from the tail of which
a cobweb ball dangles and skips along the water.
When the fish sees the sparkle of the pearlshell splin-
ters in it, he mistakes it for something good for his
interior, and locks his teeth into it. There is a big
“kick up” when any of the youngsters get their
noses and ears bored. Their families have
to “come to light” with numerous pigs, which are
tethered in holes in the reef and left to be drowned
bp the incoming tide. Those who are to subsequently
“scoff” them assemble to witness the drowning enter-
tainment. Neighboring villagers are invited to these
ceremonies, and are lavishly provided for during
many suns. Every big man has his own dancing
circus, which is walled in with knobs of coral.
AVomen are not usually admitted. AVhen they are,
they must crawl in. 'After inter-island fights, both
sides meet, and for every arrow or spear that has
killed an enemy a youth is given over in recompense
to them. These boys are not necessarily slain in-
stanter, but inevitably will be. So until a man’s
whiskers sprout his tenure of existence is a trifle
precarious on Santa Cruz.
“Forest Devil”: Rc the query of “Pick”
as to how the black cockatoo has the ability to locate
the wood-grub (B. 7/5/T4). The bird, either of the
red or yellow variety, frequents forest country wherein
grow its principal “wormeries,” to wit, the oak and
wild apple. “Pick” apparently has never seen the
bird at work, or he would have noticed that it has
a perfect system of hearing. Alighting on the trunk
of an oak it listens for the boring of the termite.
Having taken bearings by tapping to find the grub’s
hollow, the bird drills a hole to the termite’s tunnel,
and then commences its wood-rending operations.
If prospects are not good, cocky sinks trial holes
along the tunnel. However, the bird’s titbit

is not grub, but the dry, wood-like fruit of the' oak.
It worries “Pick” to know why the grub calmly
awaits destruction. The insect is blind and oblivious
to impending ruin. The parrot himself is no titbit
being—when denuded of feathers, beak and claws —
composed principally of muscles, sinews and .bilack,
leathery meat, which doubtless results from hard
grubbing for grub and finishing up with a course of
acorns for dessert.

THE SUITABLE IMMIGRANT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is true that some few of the men who are
brought out to go upon the land are not adapted for
the work. They have no experience and some rather
curious theories, and there is no doubt more discrim-
ination in the selection of farm laborers and settlers
would be advisable. But on the whole we are doing
very well, and in time even those least promising
cases may develop into excellent farmers.
—Victorian authority.
We’re getting some amazing men
Up here at Pinafore,
To mess about with bail and pen,
Each day they send us more.
The bulk of them are immigrants
Who solemnly suppose
It is a thing of little stress
To make the blighted wilderness
To blossom like a rose.
They also think it easy toil
To flood the blessed lee
With corn and wine and fruit and oil,
And, like the green bay tree,
To start the sand plains flourishing.
They also surely know
This hard-baked, sour and hungry land
Will laugh out with a harvest grand
If tickled with a hoe.

Quite thoroughly he seems to know
The agricultural game.
He brought a new lawn-mower with
A lot of other props.

Why that’s to mow me crops!”

WHEN “OUT OF SORTS" TAKE
“CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.
If fretful, feverish, constipated, bilious
or tongue coated, take this delicious
“fruit laxative” at once.
The vague, general discomfort of being
“out of sorts,” when the stomach turns
against food, the eye is dull and the tongue
coated and heavy, can be banished in a few
hours by a dose of “California Syrup of
Figs.” There is no need to put up with these
things until to-morrow, waiting for bedtime
to take medicine. “California Syrup of Figs”
will begin to do you good the moment you
take it —at any hour—and cause no discom-
fort. This pleasant-tasting, refreshing fruit
laxative cleanses the stomach, gently sweeps
away all accumulations of undigested food,
and stimulates the liver to assist in relieving
the bowels. By evening the tongue will be
clear again and the overflow of bile swept
away: you will be yourself again, with a
good appetite and digestion. This is the
medicine which does such wonders for chil-
dren of all ages; but it is every bit as good
for grown-up people, and there are full direc-
tions for every age with the bottle. Take
care to buy the genuine, as there are imita-
tions on the market. Ask for “California
Syrup of Figs,” and look for the name and
trade mark of the “California Fig Syrup Co.”
All leading chemists sell “California Syrup of
Figs,” 1/li and 1/9 per bottle.

wood all furniture is destined to be of steel. “Since
the steel for a given piece of furniture costs only
one-fifth as much as the wood. Steel furniture is
light, because only a little steel is required and it can
be polished in perfect imitation of mahogany, walnut,

“Masarcus”: The good-natured-looking
cocky had entered Crogan’s pub which dispensed
refreshment in one of the North Cowst towns, and had
called for a whisky. I was at the other end of the
bar, and when I heard Crimp, the town loafer, Who
at the time Was bn a bender, ask the cocky in a
loud tone of voice to have one With him, I looked up;
The cocky Was in the middle of his drink, but iri
friendly fashion he took the glass from his lips tS
say, “No, thanks, ole man.” Cfimp, in the Way Of
drunken men, was Outraged. “Dammit,” he yelled,
“won’t you drink With me?” “Just ’ad one,’*
answered the cocky amiably, as he laid his empty
glass on the counter. “Don’t feel like another, thanks-
allsame.” His gentle tones indicated the man of
peace, but Crimp didn’t Want peace. He wanted
pieces, and big chunks at that. “Orl tigh’,” he
snarled; “go t’ ’ell.” The yeoman smiled genially,
and turned to leave the bar. But Crimp blocked his
passage. “I said go t’ ’ell,’ he remarked in thick,
menacing tones. “Righto,” grinned Jonas, as he
endeavored to pass.” “’Ere, ’oo are yer shovin’?”
shouted the truculent Crimp. Resignedly the other
turned to the opposite door. Crimp lurched after
him. “I said, ’oo yer pushin’ ?” he yelled, dancing in
his efforts to induce a scrap. He Was a man of
small stature, and he looked even smaller against
the six-two of the cow-bailer. But he was pug-
nacious. As the stranger wouldn't oblige him he
went into a paroxysm of vituperation that was appal-
ling. The big man only continued to smiie in good-
natured fashion. “Yer —-—!” yelled the infuriated
Crimp. “Yer ■ , yer ginger- ’eaded —■ —.” The
cocky’s smile did not waver. “Gam,” went On the
frenzied one, “yer mother orter bin ashamed of
’erself fer ’avin’ yer.” The jovial grin was main-
tained. “Yer a —- —-, an’ yer grandmother Was a
monkey,” choked Crimp ; but the smile grew wider if
anything. Then Chimp began to see the position Was
hopeless. “Orl rig’,” he snarled. “If yer won’t
fight, yer won’t. But yer a crimson, red-headed
, all the same ; an’ all yer family’s jist as bad.”
Then, turning to us, he jeered: “Wot do yer think of
’im? Ain’t ’e a fair cow?” The ensuing five
minutes were terrifying in their violence. The hap-
less Crimp found himself whirled around and around
the room like a piece of paper on a windy day. After
he had hit the wall eight times, and had wiped the
counter clear of glasses with the back of his head, and
had broken two whiskv-advertisement mirrors with
his boots he volplaned downwards with hurricane
speed. If the floor had been of wood he would pro-
bably have finished his aerial flight down among the
foundations of the building. But three inches of
solid cement stopped them. Then the worm that had
turned stepped back to survey his handiwork. “I’ll
learn yer,” he gasped, as his whiskers quivered with
rage—“l’ll learn yer that I don’t mind some things,
but I draws the line at blasphemy.” The name of
the Cow had been taken in vain.
“Leo Lear”: That unfortunate bird, the
black duck, gets a rough reception from some of the
feathered hunters as well as from alleged sports, who
pot for record bags on “opening” days. The little
falcon of the hawk order (the “duck hawk” of bush-
men) is never happier than when hurling his insig-
nificant weight through a mob of flying ducks. When
the edible birds rise off a pool there is no sign of
the hawk ; but once they are fairly on the wing, he
appears suddenly from the upper blue, or a belt of
timber. Singling out one duck for his special care
and attention, he goes at it like an aerial torpedo.
Jf he strikes, there is a duck’s funeral; though some-
times the bolt misses, whereupon the small devil
swirls upwards and strikes down again, perhaps sever-
ing the black party’s head with a blow of his wing.
All the other ducks drop to shelter instanter, and
nothing short of a 13in. gun will make them rise

while the falcon is in the locality. Here the “sport”
comes in, and pots the terrified flock. The falcon
doesn’t draw the line at ducks. His speed and
strength make him the terror of the air. Riding
along a creek recently I disturbed the residents in
the reed beds and pools. Two falcons followed my
tracks, and chased successively ducks, plover, bald-
coots, herons and even a lumbering old bittern.
They were not out to kill, but just hunted for the
love of it, and the way the rest of the bird life got
to cover suggested posterity fleeing from the public
debt. The black falcon, which measures only 1 1 Jin.
from beak to tail, can slay, and frequently does, as
large a bird as the wild turkey (bustard, not scrub
variety) whose length is 4ft.
“Oimai”: “Vakuta” is pretty well on the
mark in referring to the villainous cruelty of the
Papuan to animals, but, as a rule, this is only exer-
cised when the victim (including human beings) is
intended for tucker. To his dogs and pigs on non-
butchering days the Papuan is a good boss, and as a
“spoiler” of his kiddies our own aboriginal, notori-
ously an indulgent parent, can hardly excel him. This
and his fondness for bird pets does not prevent him
from breaking the wings or legs of captured birds and
other animals or from cracking the thighbone of a
brother nig who has been collected in a tribal foray,
in order to keep him fresh without risking escape,
until a convenient opportunity for dinner comes along.

How encouraging this is as demonstrating the de-

“Bulli” : Over Lord Howe Island way, the
pretty little black mutton-birds are very numerous,
and at one time formed a staple article of diet, being
caught in thousands, at the right time, and salted
down for future use. The old birds go egging in
their burrows about September, and feed the young
ones from time of hatching until about
April, apparently solely on squid (im-
mature cuttle-fish). During this time
the nestlings wear a thick coat of
dark grey down, and a layer of fat
accuniulates under the skin. They
make excellent bait for fishing with,
but as bait for humans they don’t go.
Like other underground vegetables,
they are not to be dug till ripe.
About a month before the birds reach
maturity the mothers cease feeding
them (they are then nourished solely
by the fat previously accumulated),
and the plumage progresses for flight.
This is the time to catch your mut-
tons. They have now very little fat,
and there is plenty of good red flesh
very like mutton in appearance (hence the name).
It is peculiar that, though fed entirely on the fishiest
of fishy foods, the bird has no ancient and fish-like
smell or taste.

“A.H.A.”: What about sun-bathing as a
cure for cancer? It begins to appear likely that
cancer is caused by the whiteness of our skins, due
to civilised man covering them from the light-rays.
A medical paper reports the opinion of a doctor Who
has had experience with radium therapy that cancer
is due to the white skin absorbing none of the light
rays but the ultra-violet, and possibly a little of
the violet. The aborigines of Papua, Central America,
etc., are amazingly free from cancer. A Parisian
professor points out that the skin of the nigger
absorbs all the light-rays, the skin of the red races
absorbs all but the red and orange rays, the yellow
races absorb all but the red, orange and yellow, and
the white races reflect back almost the whole visible
spectrum. It is therefore suggested that the effec-
tiveness of the X-ray and radium in arresting cancer
is due to the fact that they are able to penetrate
the white skin and supply to the deeper tissues a sub-
stitute for the light food for which these cells have
been starving. Man, by clothing, insulates his body
from the light rays of the sun, and it is. only man
and rats and burrowing animals and domestic animals
kept away from the sun that suffer from cancer.
There is no record of cancer amongst the Greeks.
It begins to look as if the sun-bathers of our beaches
are right and the wowsers, as usual, wrong. The
time will evidently come when even wowsers will
be compelled, by their doctor’s orders, to sun-bake.
It may cure them of cancer, but it will be a horrible
sight. .

“Vigiltlns” : I think tile black cockatoo the
fnost extraordinary bird in Australia, as far as
nesting and rearing the yriung are concerned. The
tiest is made in the hollow of a tree. Two eggs are
laid the same size as those Of the white
Cockatoo. Wheri the vOurig are hatched they are
looked after by the parents until nearly fledged.
Then, without exception, one bird is killed or starved
to death. The rieSt is usually built in a vety high
tree in a quiet place. 1 noticed this strange custom
of the black cockatoo in the Par North —in Kim-
berley and the Territory, and I have also seen it
in the Grampians in Victoria. But the two species
ate different. Those in the Grampians have yelldw
crests,. ears and underneath tail feathers, The northern
black cockatoos have red crests and tail feathers.
They are very difficult to keep ill captivity.. In East
Kimberley I kept one in a cage in my camp ifor two
month's, when it pined away and died. It was
never lively. I have tried the same experiment in
Victoria, but without any success. Black cockatoos
are very shy birds. The chief food of these birds is
a small white grub found in the cones of trees.
The supply is very limited, which no doubt accounts

for the limitation of family. White cockatoos
sometimes resort to the same tactics when food is
scarce. But the white folk live anywhere, soon
become used to captivity and eat anything and thrive
on it. The black birds never do. A noted Australian
bird-catcher,- a Frenchman, who did a big trade in
Europe with Australian birds, told me that, although
he had tried times out of number, he never landed
a black cockatoo in Europe.

Sore Throat is so Prevalent.
THESE three striking illustra-
tions reveal at once the reason
why Sore Throat, in all its varied,
painful and depressing forms, in-
cluding Tonsillitis, is so common
a complaint; how it may be readily
cured, on the one hand, and effec-
tually prevented on the other.
Sore Throat and Tonsillitis,
with other infectious diseases, like
Diphtheria, Scarlet Fever, Measles,
Mumps, Whooping-cough and
Consumption, are due to germs.
These float in the air, settle and
develop in the throat. In vigorous
health, they are destroyed by the
blood. If, however, the individual
is below par the blood is not able
to contend against the rapidity
with which the germs multiply,
and he gets the disease whose
o-erms he has inhaled.-

already mentioned, and convales-
cents from them, are constantly
passing through the streets, and
going to theatres, music-halls, con-
certs, and other public gatherings.
Not only do they exhale germs
which infect the air, but they carry
a great deal of dust with them.
The dust particles, like the sooty
particles in fogs, act as rafts to
float the germs into the throat.
It is obvious, therefore, that these
germs must be destroyed to prevent
them destroying us.
Their enormous number is sug-
gested by Figs, i and 2.

germs, seen under the microscope.
Each dot contains thousands of
germs.
Fig. 2 is a similar plate exposed
to fine dust and treated in the same
way. The colonies of germs car-
ried by it are seen as the white
patches on the plate, the blurred
and fainter markings being the
particles of dust themselves.
Fig. 3 is a similarly-exposed
plate which was previously dis-
infected with saliva containing
Wulfing’s Formamintjthe pleasant-
tasting throat tablet which a
physician, writing in one of the
leading medical periodicals, re-
cently declared was “ Unquestion-
ably the germ-destroyer of the
age.” The power of Wulfing’s
Formamint is adequately proved
by the fact that neither from the
air nor from the dust were any
germs able to develop. In other
words, Formamint completely
killed all the germs. It is, there-
fore, a trustworthy cure for Sore
Throat, and a complete preventive
of diseases whose germs multiply
in the throat.
The highest medical testimony
endorses these statements of the
efficacy of the preparation. The
Chief Medical Officer of one of
our largest Infectious Diseases’
Hospitals states in one of the
leading medical journals, “I
have never had Sore Throat myself
since I began to use Wulfing’s
Formamint, although I suffered
periodically before.”
Another physician writes in the
Practitioner : “ Having tried all
the British Pharmacopoeia
lozenges, and most of the well-
known proprietary antiseptic
lozenges, I have become reduced
to one, and one only (for sore
throat), namely, Formamint.”
Over ten thousand doctors have
also written describing the re-
markable results they have ob-
tained in curing the various forms
of Sore Throat and Tonsillitis, and
preventing the diseases mentioned
above, by Wulfing’s Formamint.
Of all Chemists, price 2/6d. per
bottle. All imitations of Forma-
mint are worthless. Insist on
having Wulfing’s Formamint.

their throats.
A Law that is Habitually Set at Naught.
WiiENEVEfi the State tries to legislate out
of existence some imperishable human im-
pulse it falls in, and does it so comprehen-
sively, moreover, that it succeeds in making
law-breakers and liars and frauds of per-
sons who would otherwise pursue the more
or less straight path. Most anti-gambling
legislation is in the above class. So is the
legal objection to what is known as collu-
sion in divorce. Just as it is impossible to
prevent some people from gambling, so it is
impossible to force other people to live
together, when the experience of years has
proved to them that they are hopelessly
antipathetic, not to say abhorrent, to one
another. The idiotic position is, in law,
that if a husband and wife detest each
other so violently that they are both yearn-
ing for separation they cannot achieve that
separation without being guilty,l either of
misconduct or of pulling the law’s leg. On
the other hand, where only one party to a
marriage desires a divorce, the matter is
mostly capable of being adjusted without
any difficulty. In such a case there is no
need for false swearing on either side; no
need for a sort of conspiracy between the
parties and their solicitors; no need for
counsel to make an elaborate hut thoroughly
unconvincing pretence at not knowing what
is occurring; and no need for the divorce
judge to have his intelligence insulted when
the suit comes on for hearing. Where only
one party hankers after*.-divorce, it. means
in Ofi cases out of a hundred that that party
wishes to marry someone else; and is, in
fact, married to that person in—to employ
the civil periphrasis of, bellowdrama —“the
sight of Heaven.” The evidence is all,on
the table waiting to be picked up, so to
speak. Whei*e»H>oth parties • desire to 1 be*
separated jthere is rarely a question of a
co-re. Ncffiier wants to have anything more
to do with marriage. They are, it only tem-
porarily, dead, ■suicidally tired of the whole
institution. In such a position they have
two alternatives before them. In the first
place, they may decide to go on living
together. The effect of this forlorn-hope
attempt to solve a problem which is in its
essence insoluble, is observable in the regu-
larly recurring “domestic dramas” in our
midst—queer, purposeless crimes, where the
husband drifts home at tea-time, has the
usual few words with his wife, and sud-
denly, apropos of nothing in particular, goes
to the kitchen dresser, sharpens a knife and
cuts her throat, the throats of as many of
the children as are available, and finally his
own. Provided the ill-mated pair realise
the hopelessness of trying to live together,
and have 'sufficient money to go to law, they
may adopt the alternative of a collusive
divorce. A collusive divorce may be ob-
tained in several ways. Assuming it is
decided that the husband shall be represented
to the Court as the blameworthy party the
custom is to hire a co : re.—a complaisant
female who is- prepared, for a consideration,
to be convicted publicly of a lapse of which
she may or may not be guilty. Failing this,
the parties rely for • success on a plea of
desertion. One of them away. An
attorney, or other expert,?'dictates a plaus-
ible letter from the one who remains behind
clamoring for the return of the departed.
It is ignored. The Court is appealed to by
means of an affidavit. Incidentally, the
petitioner swears that there has been no
collusion. No one believes the petitioner.
A decree nisi is granted. On the other
hand, the procedure may he bungled, and
the judge is obliged regretfully to refuse a
decree. In any event, and at the best, a
tremendous amount of lying, false swearing,
perjury, unprofessional conduct and so forth
has to he indulged in. Where is the sense
in perpetuating such foolery? The law in-
ferentially recognises the futility of trying
to keep together persons whose dis-
positions are incompatible, by shutting its
eyes as hard as possible to collusion, just
as it shuts its eyes to eight-tenths of the
illegal gambling that goes on in the com-
munity. II would be cheaper, less vitiating
to the morale of the people, and better for
all hands, barring possibly the lawyers, if
the Law removed its head from the sand,
and announced that in its opinion collusion
should he made legal. The Legislature
would then, in all likelihood, hasten to put
through a Bill enabling any two people to
be divorced provided they could convince
the Court: (1) that further existence
together was intolerable; (2) that their
children—if they had any—should not suffer
materially by their separation. A reform of
that sort would save a lot of murders year
by year, not to mention minor unpleasant-
nesses. And, such is the cussed'ness of
human nature, it might well operate to draw
many contending husbands and wives closer
together. A thing is dearer to many people
when there is always an imminent likelihood
of its being easily lost.

“Vagabond”: A Mr. Martin Johnson has
written a book describing the cruise with
Jack London through the Islands on the
Snark. He winds up the book with some
remarks on Sydney, and I can only con-
clude that some joker must have pulled his
leg out as long as the main boom. There is
some truth in what he concludes of a num-
ber of Australian laws —that they must
have been hatched up by a Government
consisting of preachers or missionaries. Rut
lie comments wonderingly on the law that
stops all the street cars while the churches
are running, and adds that the full stop
also applies to all trains —“even the fast
express trains stop wherever they happen to.
be at the time and do not start up again
until church service is over.” So next time
the driver of the Melbourne-Sydney express
happens to run over into the church-hours
he will know what to do. Reading between
the lines I can sympathise with a thirsty
Mr. Johnson wandering desperately round
Sydney with his tongue hanging out search-
ing for a drinkery. “Few restaurants are
open on Sunday,” he comments sadly, and
even if a man calls on a friend at an hotel
he must wait outside until the friend is dug
out to vouch for him. The brief remark
that “there are no Sunday papers” will
rouse to fury those editors and advertise-
ment managers who make such proud claims
about their huge Sunday circulations. I’ve
been out of Australia for a year, and I’m
sorry to learn from this book that nigger
hunting, lynching, burning and shooting are
now the popular pastimes of the Sydney or
Australian people. At least that’s what I
must conclude from Mr. Jolinsing’s side
remark that “The Australians are worse
negro haters even than Americans.” And
after his final summing-up of Sydney I’d
advise the writer to increase his life insur-
ance policy before he calls there again, or
better still to avoid it and linger round
Brisbane. Brisbane has such broad, pretty,
green streets... .bungalows. .. .splendid car
service. .. .that “Sydney is far out-
shadowed.” Will Sydney stand this or will
it rise in its might and do battle?
The late Prahran (Melb.) Town Hall
will not have been burned in vain if the site
of it is leased to the highest bidder and
another hall is erected in a cheaper part of
the suburban city. There were two halls—
old and new—adjoining one another in the
crowded centre of • Prahran, and the least
old one went up to Heaven in smoke. The
idea is to dispose of all the ground, which
is a corner allotment and would produce the
needful for the erection of an up-to-date pile
of municipal buildings elsewhere. Chapel-
street would gain another palatial emporium,
and the new, commodious municipal busi-
ness place would dignify a less crowded
part of the district. A similar idea should
have forced upon Melbourne City
Councillors ere those fatted wasters spent
£35,000 in dolling up their private meeting
rooms.
The inspiriting news that Governor-Gen-
eral Mo-Ferg may import a Scottish
piper for private consumption sets a Mel-
bourne paper demonstrating the, ancientry
of the pipes. It tracks them right back to
old Rome. But what of the piper who
played before Moses? And what of the piper
who was before Moses? The bagpipes supplied
war-music for Assyria, and Assyria was a
very big country for 13 centuries. It had a
farmer army, like the Boers. The farmer
is a hard fighter when he is up against it.
And when he had the enemy in front and
the bagpipes behind lie chose the enemy
every time. In the days of Tiglatli-pileser
I. and Ashir-bani-pal and Esar-liaddon, the
host went to war with a great leader in
front, and 120,000 hardened agriculturists
running next, and the bagpipes howling
in the rear, and not even the gates of Hell
could stand against Assyria.
An incentive to suffragettish fury is sup-
plied by the London County Council in its
ridiculous stipulation that women doctors
employed by the Public Health Department
shall resign their billets if they get married.
Spinsters only are appointed. Out of 10
new appointments, at a salary of £4OO a
year, three are offered to women. They get
equal pay with the men, but they must quit
the job if they enter the holy state of mat-
rimony. All the L.C.C. talk about the pro-
bable duties of maternity doesn't alter the
fact that a woman-doctor only wants ordi-
nary leave of absence for her lying-in, if
she does have children, and in any case she
is bound to be a wiser practitioner after
marriage than before it. The L.G.G. can t
consistently plead that a qualified woman
loses profess.onal value by cohabiting with
a man, who is in many cases himself a
medico.
“Hamer”: The authorities have just dis-
covered another hole in a law which is
already mostly holes. It made the find in
the course of an attempt to prise back from
S’Africa a man who had gone there from
Australia, leaving behind a starving wife
and children. When the deserter was
brought before the Durban Police Court ror
extradition it transpired that he did not
come under the Fugitive Offenders Act. It
was held that as he had contributed more
or less to his family’s support subsequent to
his departure, his bolt for freedom did not
constitute desertion. So, apparently, any
waster who desires to evade his domestic
obligations has merely to get away to
another country, and remit some money for
a week or so. By this device he may both
rehabilitate his character ’ and cast on the
poor old State the entire burden of feeding,
clothing and housing his dependents.
“Barabbas Hell” : What is all this I hear
about the wickedness of the tango? Where
is its infamy to be inspected? 1 have pur-
sued the tango from teas to suppers, and I
have examined it narrowly on the stage, in
ballrooms, and in even hotter shops, yet the
vile, soul-searing suggestiveness of it is
withheld frojn me. Also my friend Judas
Purgatory can’t find it. As 1 look at it the
tango is not a dance so much as a problem
in Euclid. The performers execute a vast
number of mathematical movements as pre-
cise as a marionettes’ procession, with here
and there a wriggle that suggests that they
may wake up presently. However, they do
not wake up. They go on dismally with a
sort of high-kneed prance suggestive of a
horse with string-halt. I envy the wowser
his amazing susceptibility to erotic sensa-
tion. To me the tango is nothing like as
voluptuous as chess.
Donald Murray, a very serious young
man with auburn hair, who used to be
leader of the staff of the S. M. Herald.
looks like being the biggest modern earth-
quake in the world’s telegraph offices. When
Murray left Sydney—his last big job for
the Herald was the reporting of the
Federal Convention debates —it was to go
to England and push an invention for speed-
ing up telegrams; and after about 10 years
of battling be has perfected a process which
the Post Office lias bought in Britain and
the Western Union Co. in the U.S.
Murray is a Maorilander, and (this was in
Sam Cook’s day) found favor with the
Herald by reason of the fact that, besides
having ,had about seven years press experi-
ence in Maoriland, he could write M.A.
after his name. About the time that Sam
Cook was finding out that Murray was a
graduate, the old S. M. Herald bos-s was
asking Randolph Bedford what University
he got liis training in, and was getting the
startling misinformation that that by-no-
means humble suppliant for a job came
from the Bourke Meat Works.

POLITICAL
POINTS
■The Constitution was in great peril one
evening last week, and for a while the whole
fabric of Government rocked on its founda-
tions. It was suddenly discovered in the
House of Reps, that the Mace was missing.
Messengers were summoned in haste, and in
aped whispers they were told to search
everywhere for the gilded stick. For some
r&inutes they searched in vain ; but just when
it looked as though anything might happen,
the mhgic- symbol was found - poked away
under a seat-in the Chamber. And the House
hadn’t pluck 'enough to leave it there.
VERY SLOW.

.(Commonwealth Meteorologist Hunt has
just issued a chart showing variations in
Australian as compared with world tempera-
tures. The highest mean annual tempera-
ture is that of Khartoum, with 83.5 degrees,

The new G.-G. has already started to say
unpleasant things. Even thus early, he re-
marks, he observes an absence of acute dis-
sensions in the Feddral Parliament.
All immigrants, it seems, according to
one alleged supporter of the Labor plat-
form, ought to be prohibited :
All unionists should unite to keep immigrants, from
rushing into Australia. There should not be a cry
raised against Dings and Dagoes any more than there
should be against English, Irish and Scoteh. The
Englishman—the Sassenach —is no more wanted in
Australia than he is in Ireland. The state of the
labor market has decided this. There are men of all
nationalities out of work to-day. Action should be
directed against all immigrants.
It is more important, then, that Australia
Bill should get his present wage than that
Australia Bill’s country should be kept
white and Australia Bill’s daughter saved
from the gentle embraces of an Asi'atic in-
vader ! And, anyhow, can’t there be found
for the immigrant, in all this coufitry, a
job at which he can earn his own keep?
Is there only a limited amount of work to
be done and a a fixed fund out of which to
pay the workers? If it were so the greater
the number of workers the smaller, of
course, the share for each. But there is no
such limit and no such fixed fund. The
worker of. to-day,, in fact, gets a far higher
wage than, his predecessor of 50 years ago
when the population was not a quarter so
numerous.
A HORRIBLE (HIC) APPARITION!
New South Wales is easily the most drunken State
in the Commonwealth.— N.S.W. Alliance report.
The lion in the path, he said, was not the consoli-
dation of £300,000,000, but the fear as to future
borrowings. —John Forrest, on State Debts transfer.
When Andrew Fisher comes into his king-
dom again there are three things which he
should do very suddenly and very strenu-
ously. (1) He should abolish the half-
sovereign, which is a pale, silly, sickly, use-
less coin that can never be told from a
sixpence in a dim light. (2) He should
pass an Act withdrawing dll trading rights
from those banks which refuse to supply
the Government IPs. notes on demand. (3)
He should pass an Act making every bank
official who professes to shudder when the
Federal 10s. bote is shown or mentioned
liable to not less than three months’ gaol
without bail and without the option. There
is too much option in this world, and too
much shuddering.
“Miles” : Military officers of all ranks are
unaffectedly pleased at the bump which
General Hamilton’s report administers to
the Finance Member of the Board which
controls their destinies. “Jimmy”
Lang is the living embodiment
of red tape. He was originally
a paymaster in the N. S. Wales
forces, and he was a good pay-
master too. But to be a good
paymaster l is little more than
the equivalent of being a com-
petent clerk. Under the exist-
ing system N.S.W.’s ex-pay-
master is empowered to say
how Australia’s army shall be run—so
firmly does he control the purse-strings—
and the men who are in direct touch with
the army are growing weary; of it.
That section of the Labor party which
likes to think 'of itself as the most advanced
is beginning once more to yell against immi-
gration. “We don’t want immigration of
any sort,” it says. But we can’t help get-
ting it. Our country is still mostly un-
occupied, while neighboring Asiatic coun-
tries are over-occupied. If, then, we don’t
welcome the white immigrant who comes
with a pick in his hand we shall have to
welcome the yellow immigrant who comes
loaded with a gun. Placed as we are there
is nno other • alternative —it must be either
the friendly immigrant now or a beastly
unfriendly -one presently.
The N. S. Wales Government now can-
didly admits that it views the Savings Banks
as a means not for the encouragement of
thrift, but for securing funds to finance
undertakings which the private banks will
not look at, for the obvious reason that they
don’t think the security good enough. In
these undertakings, most of them experi-
mental and many of them dubious, the
money will be locked up either permanently
or for very many years; hence, if the State
has no money of its own to put into them,
but nevertheless must finance them, it is
plain that the only satisfactory way to get the
funds is by long-dated loans. The savings-bank
deposits are practically deposits withdraw-
able without notice; given a run of bad
seasons or any other kind of severe
set-b.aek, millions would be called for
in the course of a few months—perhaps
a few. days. What sort of Government is
it which cheerfully encourages a most
serious crisis in such circumstances by
putting this money into “a class of business
which the private banks will not under-
take,” though more than half the deposits
of the private banks are fixed for a term
and could much more safely be used for
these purposes?
“S.”: Attorney-General Ir-
vine was unfortunate in his
employment of similes recently.
He began by comparing the
Labor party to an ostrich with
its head in the, sand. Someone
explained to hitn that the ostrich
does not stifle itself at the ap-
proach of danger, so he tried
again, and got rid of the state-
ment that preference to union-
ists was to the Labor party what
Aladdin’s old man of the sea was
to him (Aladdin). And then
his little daughter, or someone
equally juvenile, asked if he
shouldn’t have said Sinbad in-
stead of Aladdin. Remarking
acidly that the sailor should
stick to his last, and not inter-
fere in politics, the great man
chided the infant into a state
of silence, and only pausing to
mention that the political game
was as full of spikes, these days,
as the fretful Columbine, he
stalked coldly from the tapom.
_ Last week there was some fuss about the
circulation of forged Bank of Maoriland £lO
notes, and the Daily Telegraph, spreading
itself in its usual style, thus improved the
occasion:—-
Incidentally, the likeness :of the Commonwealth
10s. note to the £lO note has come into forcible
prominence, not only in this State (N.S.W.), but
throughout the whole of Australia ; and a member of
the detective staff yesterday enSphasised the fact that
quite recently there have been cases of tradespeople
being victimised in the very simple fashion of having
the 10s. note passed off for the £lO note.
The detective went on to say that his advice
was that a careful watch should be kept.
This now ancient story is a horrible example
of how a good working lie will keep on walk-
ing round. Long before the £lO notes were
printed, or even the £1 note was issued, the
10s. note was said to be raging round on
this nefarious stunt. It was an embittered
private-enterprise banker who told the writer
the story the second day the 10s. notes were
out. The swindle happened in George-street;
name of victimised trader not known,
although the exact words of the objurgation
he passed on the Fisher Government for its
beastly 10s. note idea were remembered and
treasured. It was next heard of at North
Sydney, where the name of the trader was
incautiously given. Interviewed, he declared
the statement a lie, and added that he had
never seen a 10s. note. After that, it turned
up at Parramatta, and was circulated there
at the expense of a very sane and sober pub-
lican till he threatened to sue somebody for
libel for saying that he could not tell a' 10s.
from a £lO note. Since then, it has been
resurrected three times every day in the
city, and has raged round all the suburbs;
and just when it was dying a natural death
it is revived in the Telegraph office by an
alleged detective who advises that a careful
watch should be kept. A 10s. note is 7Jin.
long by 3|in. wide. The word “shillings” is
printed very plainly on the face no less than
six times. The “Ten” is printed more times
than the writer cares to count; but the man
who could miss the six large words, “shil-
lings,” must be quite blind. On the back
the word “shillings” occurs no less than four
times in the most legible form. The £lO
note is 6Jin. by 4in., and its printing is the
plainest possible. So the statement that
“tradespeople are being victimised” in this
manner is a libel on the tradespeople. Curi-
ously enough, no one has suggested that a
careful watch should be kept because of the
resemblance between a half-sovereign and a
sixpence in the dim light of an outside tram-
car seat —a real danger which the use of
the 10s. note abolishes.
BURLESQUE.
Office under the present circumstances is unbear-
able. There must be a dissolution.
—Joe Cook desperately and frequently.
THE GREAT BEAR-TAMER: “ Heavens! I
was never so tired of a turn as I am of
this. Oh , for the curtain! ”
“Maintop” introduces the centralisation
curse as a side-line: —
The long-dreaded Sydney Harbor horror called round
to say it was nice and handy on May 19, when the
big loaded tramp Courtfield ran into the ferry
steamer Kiandra off Oremorne, or Robertson Point.
By a deft movement the master of the Courtfield
slewed round just in time to avoid cutting down the
ferry boat, but not before her huge anchor, dangling
over the bow, had caught in the smoking saloon of
the Kiandra and ripped it into matchwood. Three
men near the protruding mudhook were so panicked
that they dived overboard for safety. This narrow
escape of a catastrophe should open the eyes of Syd-
ney Harbor Trust Commissioners to the dangerous
practice of mooring large tramp steamers between
Kirribilli and Cremorne. The accident seems to have
received material assistance from the fact that the
Norwegian s.s. Tysla was moored off Cremorne Point,
and when the Kiandra ducked round her stern the
Courtfield, which had just picked up her anchor, was
not noticed to be moving in time for the Kiandra
to get clear. Whether any person on either ship
was deserving of blame or not there is no doubt that
if the Courtfield hadn’t been moored in Neutral Bay
she wouldn’t have had to cross four lines of ferry
traffic to get into her own water, while if the Tysla
hadn’t been there the view of the two colliding skip-
pers wouldn’t have been obstructed. It should be a
standing rule that outward-bounders should anchor
on the southern side of the harbor and inward-
bounders on the northern. This would obviate the
trouble now caused by vessels trying to get across
to their own water. Some years ago the barque
Criffel, in tow coming out of Neutral Bay, and cross-
ing into her own water, ran slap into and sank the
s.s. Buningyong just near where the present mixup
happened. Meanwhile Port Stephens, where all the
tramp steamers trading to N.S.W. could lie comfort-
ably, is given over to Spanish mackerel and cor-
morants.

BLOTCHES ON FACE.

WONDERFUL RESULTS FROM TAK-
ING DR. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT
PTT T C? ;
Nothing is more worrying to people, es-
pecially ladies, than to have their com-
plexions spoiled by pimples and blotches,
-these are invariably due to poor condition
ot the blood, caused by a disordered liver
not performing its. functions, and a remedy
that will set the liver right is consequently
the only thing to free one from these dis-
figuring and painful eruptions. An excel-
lent instance of the efficacy of Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills as a blood purifying
remedy is related by Miss Violet Bayley. of
6 Moores Street, - off Botany Road. Alex-
andria, who writes: “Just a few lines to
say that I have been taking Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills and found they do me;a
great amount of good. Previously I was
always suffering from bilious attacks; jn
addition to this I had red patches on niy
face and was languid and tired every dafy.
Having taken doctor’s medicines without
feeling any the better for it, and as one of
my cousins had received a great deal of bene-
fit; from Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, on
his recommendation I tried them and found
they just suited my constitution, and now
always, keep them in the house and recom-
mend them to my friends. I am also
pleas&| to state they, do my mother a lot of
good too. You have my permission to ufee
this statement for advertising purposes.”*'

“Hermes”: Brethren, stand by and hear
me. “Howe’er it be, it seems to me, ’Tis only noble
to be strops. Kind hearts are more than coronets,
But better'still the reach that’s lons.’’ This clash-
ing of Defence and snort can onlv be ended by the
military authorities talcing over the control and organ-
isation of all athletic games of the senior or first
grade. In a very little while the active army of
Australia will contain all the young men under 26
years of age; and if they all drill on Saturday after-
noons. first-grade sports will drop dead. And it
would be a national disaster if they did.- They,all
help to make our young men fit and able to fight, pro-
vided they have been taught how to do it. A passing
charge in a tough game of Rugbv is excellent train-
ing for a dribbling rush across a fire-swept zone on a
battle-field. But it is no good dribbling men across
that battlefield if they cannot shoot straight when
they are across. What is wanted is a good working
combination of the Defence training which teaches
the art of war and the athleticism which is physical
culture in its most pleasing form. Therefore, let all
our football, baseball, lacrosse, hockey, cycling and
cricket competitions be controlled absolutely by the
Defence authorities, and organised on a regimental
basis, so that regiments shall compete ' with one
another. It would popularise Defence training as
nothing else ever could, and the splendid rivalry
between the regimental clubs would cause the young
soldiers to take a keen pride in their regiment as
well as their club- —for their club would be their regi-
ment. Also, it could be organised on an all-Austra-
lian basis, and there would be the ch’mpion Aus-
tralian Regiment, and the individual champion of
champions. Of course it will takp some working, out.
Everything that is worth having does.
At the Adelaide Cup Meeting the stakes
for the three davs, about £6500, were well divided,
for no horse, and no owner, even no trainer and no
jockey, won more than two of the 18 events. Pistol
was easily the most prominent sire. Local horses
won most of the short-distance races, but made a
horrible show when it came to staving. The Cup was
worth £l2OO to L. ‘ Robertson ; Goodwood Handicap
£550 and Leger £4OO to A D. McDonald. First or
second favorites won most of the time, and £47 11s.
was the onlv remarkable dividend. In all, £63,000
odd went through the tote—a trifle less than last
year. Of this. £6300 was held as commission, the
Government being sweetened with one-fourth of it.
The other three-fourths went a long wav towards find-
ing the stake-money, - which was the mo=t ever given.
Backers cut up the Other £57,000 among themselves.
A novel horserace that finished in the
police court happened at IVhangarei (M.L.) recently.
The distance was 14 miles, and the nags had to walk
the first half-mile, trot the second and finish at any
gait they chose. The event was featured at a country
sports carnival, and the alleged object was to discover
the best general utility horse in the district. The
honor and the cash, to the extent of £7, fell to a
lady mounted on a rat of a pony. Then the Law
arrived breathlessly and ran in' all and . sundry,
alleging the event was a horserace within the mean-
ing of the Act, and promoting an unauthorised horse
scurry is one of the major sins in the isles where,
by reason of Prohibition, the empty beer keg is left
surreptitiously by night on the doorstep' of St.
pp.n-’c- Cathedral. The magistrate said he would have
to think over the matter. At latest advices he was
showing the major symptoms of brain fag.
Evidence of the hold that the Soccer brand
of toe-ball is gaining in Maoriland is to be
found in the fact that challenges from Hawkes
Bay, Westland, Wanganui and Otago have recently
been hurled at Canterbury, the holders of the Brown
Shield, the visible cmhlem of Association supremacy
in the Pawned Dominion. The M.L Council has
decided that the holders must accept all the offers of
battle and must wade into the frav without delnv.
Previously the premier Province could put off the
day of disaster by pushing some of the challenges
into next season. Efforts are being made to induce
an Australian team to visit Maoriland during August,
and if a national rep. team can’t be got together
Maoriland is willing to welcome one from N.S.W.

When the fourth round of League Ttugby
commenced in Svdney on Saturday South Svdney and
Newtown were the onlv unbeaten clubs. When night
fell they were among the slain, South Sydney having
succumbed -to the boots of Eastern Suburbs and New-
town to the feet of Balmain. Both defeats were deci-
sive ; Eastern Suburbs won lav 10'points'to four and
Balmain by 23 to eight. The first-mentioned struggle
took place at the Cricket Ground, and it is said that,
32,000 people looked on and howled, cheered and
groaned. South Svdnev’s splendid backs made gal-
lant charges, but the tackling of East Svdney was
very deadly, and charge after charge, was pulled
down, the ball snatched away and carried at head-
long speed into the Southern territory and over the
line. It was brilliant on both sides, but Fortune
was at home in the Eastern ranks. At Birchgrove the
black-and-gold backs of Balmain seemed to come to
life quite suddenly, and went charging right through
the royal blues. On the other hand, the Newtown
charges were nioned alwavs in the bud. The prane-
ing forwards bullocked the leather steadily towards
the Newtown line, and then the black-and-gold backs
came hurtling round the . .scrums, .and the rest was
riot and rout. As time wore on, Newtown made
desperate efforts to pull itself together, but the
beginnings of every passing charge were swept awav
in wild rushes the roval blues were quite unable to
stem. For the rest, Glebe stamped Annandnle flat
by 23 to four, and North Svdnev hurled Western
Suburbs to perdition by 16 to seven.

In the Sydney Union division Saturday
' va ? an afternoon of overwhelming surprises. The
hitherto unbeaten Eastern Suburbs, premier team last
season, fell on St George at Rushcutter’s Bav and
locked up 22 to five in the first half, and regarded
the ,iob as finished. It wasn’t. St. George suddenly
bounded to its bind feet and fell on the premier
crowd like a nack of tigers, and when the settling
of the dust allowed the scoring-board to be seen it
was discovered that St. George had won by 29 to
~ was amazing, and a more surprised team
than Eastern Suburbs would have been bard to find
Glebe s defeat of Manly was exnected, but that the iob
J’a dor,e , to tune of 24 points to eight
was not dreamed. South Svdnev and AVe«tern‘Suburbs
made a drawn game with six points all —winch was

lette doesn t seem to be in it with Union Rugby.
The feature of the Australian Football
League’s Sydney competition is that, although live
rounds have been played, South Sydney team is still
unbeaten, and now heads the competition list with 20
points to the .To of Sydney, the 12 of Paddington,
Newtown and Central Western. East Sydney and
North Shore are in the tail-end of desolation, with
four points each. So far neither team has won a
game, and the competition score in each case is the
product of a bye.
Melbourne’s League hoofball proceeded on
its uproarious "course on Saturday, weather being
excellent and attendances more so. South was at
home to St. Kiljla, and at one time looked like going
under, but towards the latter end concerted play and
straighten kicking gave them an advantage of 11
points—77 to St, Kilda’s 66. The Saints are a hefty
lot, and if they, hadn’t teen walloped a couple of
weeks ago by the accidental ’Dons one would think
a lot of them. 'Roy went over to Carlton prepared
for a hard battle, but the valiant team that had
drawn with South the week before had forgotten all
it knew abort the game and showed no inclination
to learn afresh. The capacity to mark and score with
long, straight kicks was entirely absent; also, its
system had perished ; whereas the ’Royites, though
they neither marked nor kicked with surprising suc-
cess, worked together like a piece of machinery and
held the Blues comfortably throughout. ’Roy, 46
points; Carlton, 28 Essendon accounted for Mel-
bourne, getting five goals 24 behinds to. five goals
seven behinds, which former score suggests that ’Don
is .looking for. disaster. Anyhow, if it can’t raise a
better performance than five goals out of 29 shots
it will reap trouble in the '•pear future. Richmond
gained its first victory this season at the expense of
Geelong—77 points .to 53; and 'Wood recklessly
piled un 125 points to ’Varsity’s 53. The Students
were alleged to be particularly fit and .able, and
extremely desirous of downing ’Wood —the only
League team they have never beaten ; sd dt looks as
though the Magpies , had determined to Teach them
a lesson. Anyhow, the Students will do well to
think hard over the calamity.
The Hand of Time snatches Hughie Mehegan
from the abyss of K. O., and gives him victory.
Though few exnected it, the feat of the
afternoon in Ass. games was the uprising of Haw-
thorn, which was more or less intoxicated with Hem-
pire Day celebrations, and took a firm grip of Wil-
liamstown, and stamped it flat, with a neat score of
88 points to ’Town’s 72. ’Town hadn’t properly re-
covered from the shock by Monday morning, but is
understood to be preparing vengeance for its oppo-
nents when they come down for the return match.
The other games also provided painful shocks for
some people, North taking a bulldog grip of its game
with ’Scray, and holding on till the bell rang—
?>or(:h, 82 points; ’Scray, 52. Essendon, somewhat
unnerved by the, temporary suspension of three of its
players for “stoushing,” put up a considerable scrap
against Port, but .lost in the last few minutes
through the latter’s surer booting—Port, 73 points ;
’Don, 58 ’Cote assumed its customary character of
a chopping block—32 points to Brighton’s 91; and
P ran, with the bargain sales on its mind, was de-
lighted at getting a draw against Brunswick—B3 all
’Wick’s were disordered, not to say mixed.
Another individual who wore a disgusted
frame of mind was one of those valiant Carlton bar-
rackers who > “jobbed” an umpire a few weeks ago.
Him the Carlton beaks communed with during the
week, and after some consideration remarked that
a contribution of £ 5 to the revenue or one month’s
free service •to his Majesty would meet the case.
Other disgruntled individuals , were the three dis-
qualified ’Don players hereinbefore mentioned and a
Cote opponent, who was passed out till May, ’l5.
there is, furthermore, a suspicion of ill-humor about
certain barrackers who threatened a couple of Ass.
umpires and were promptly handed “one to go on
with.” These officials took considerable risk ; but if
their employers can’t protect them from assault they
were probably wise to get their blows in first.
It seems that this writer inadvertently did
Hugh D. Mclntosh a wrong last week. It is not
Hugh D. who is presenting that silver belt for the
best individual footballer during the- season. Mr.
McTntosh is resting content with having donated a
handsome shield for the best club —a trophy which
should stimulate combined play.
A Port Pirie (S.A.) supporter of foot-
ball has been publicly suspected of being altogether
too enthusiastic. One of the best men in the local
club he patronises was also one of the best in his
own employ. The player disagreed with his club
somehow; also he g’ot “notice” from his boss—on
the Sole ground of his deserting the club, says the
Federated Ironworkers’ Union, which has taken the
case up. The employer who says “Choose between
your work and your play” is a familiar obstacle;
but the one who says “Play for my club, or no
work!” is a new one. After which—though it seems
a pity to spoil a good story—both the employer and
the club declare positively and publicly that foot-
ball and the notice had nothing to do with each
other, and that the plaver went elsewhere to “better”
himself. So the F.I.U. doesn’t quite know where it
are.

The English League team oil its way to
Svdnev dropped off at Adelaide and went for a
scratch team, picked up some old how, at Hawthorn
Oval. Of course the so-called South Australians had
no possible chance against this international team,
and the whole affair was a mere joke and a friendly
exhibition on the part of the visitors, who ran out
with 16 goals 23 tries, or 101 points, to nil. One
thing the match did reveal, and that is that Woods,
the English fullback, is a terrific goal kicker. He
apparently kicks from any angle, and puts a lot of
steam behind the boost. What an awful thing it
must be to be the dog of one of these mighty goal
Kickers!
The dolorous state of N.S.W. cricket last
season has driven the Cricket Association to put on
its thinking 1 cap with a view to evolving a scheme.
At its best cricket docs not send its barrackers into
hysterics, while at its worst it is always liable to
drive them to drink. The trouble to a large extent
appears to be rooted in the perfect condition of the
wickets, on which the batsmen can defy the 'trundlers
till the cows come in for milking. And now some
blessed committee or other is said to be pondoring
how to protect the wickets from the weather. What
is. wanted is some alteration in the game which will
kill monotony, or better still, •infr.se excitement into
it. Protecting the wickets will make it more mono-
tonous what should be done is to run a grubber or
cultivator down the centre of the pitch, or make the
batsman hit the ball with the edge of the bat. The
rattle of the bails, when it is heard, is sweet music
to the ears of the multitude, and calculated to make
the harmonious oof-bird sing.
Norman Brookes and Anthony F. Wilding
continue to shake up the tennis cots of Old England.
At Surbiton last week Brookes snatched the Singles
Championship from F. G. Lowe, of Albion’s Isle/ In
the Doubles Brookes and Wilding outer! Lowe and
Myers in two sets, whereupon ,the degenerate Britons
skied the towel in token of surrender. Even if Aus-
tralia fails in the Davis Cup some of the team will
have to charter a special steamer to bring back the
trophies.
The outlook for' professional cycling in
N.S.W. is about as healthy as green cheese. Accord-
ing to secretary Mackav, there are but 208 members
in the League of Wheelmen, and onlv four metropoli-
tan and three country clubs are affiliated. Worse
than all, there is only a miserable £lO of notes,
gold and silver in the cash-box. It is said that the
game is shortly to be galvanised by the invasion of
a team of international riders, for which the Federal
Council of the Leagues will fix the sanction fees and
collect and distribute them among the State Leagues
in whose territories races are held. But most likely
this is hot air or -smoke—hot air for a first guess.

The evil luck that brooSed over Eastern
Suburbs (Svdney) on Saturday pursued it- into the
Lacrosse field, where- its hitherto unbeaten team met
Petersham and was overthrown by eight to three
University had a wild riot with St. George, and
just managed to scramble out on top, with three
goals to two. Sydney administered a severe casti-
gation to Balmain, the length and strength of it
being six to four. But all these horrors paled into
insignificance compared with the awful catastrophe
which befell Maply when the aristocratic savages of
Mosman descended on it and obliterated it by 10 to
two. It makes the ears tingle.
Sydney Baseballers had a mildly exciting
time in the senii-summery afternoon, the perfect
light of which made for good hitting. Petersham
went up against Leichhardt, but prevailed not against
it, and was cast down and trampled upon by six to
four. _ Waver ley was at home to the University, and
gave it a warm, not to say .torrid, welcome, with 10
to two. Paddington and Mosman-North Sydney both
journeyed far from home, and, meeting on the plains
of Leichhardt,:, fought it out. The wild men from
Paddington were too much for the plutocrats of
Mosman, and scored 11 to five. Lane Cove and
Burwood, being of the same blue blood, so to speak,
were lust about , equal and made a drawn game with
10 each.
The amateur boxing championships of
England last month had record entries, and took the
whole of a long day to work . off. Enthusiasts could
see more than 12 hours of cbhtinuous stoush for one
admission-fee. There were eWtries from France, and
a lot from Denmark, that little country now being
very keen on the game; hut the. British folk -won at
every weight. The heavvweight champion is E. V.
Chandler, of the Stock Exchange Cricketer Douglas
was merely a referee this time.

On Saturday night next, at Sydney
Stadium, Herbert McCov will have his chance to
even his score with Milburn Saylor. Last time
tbev mef McCoy took about 26 wild occipital wallops,
and they dazed him so that hev lost his ring-craft.
Down in the 18th he whs slow in getting up, and
when he did rise it was only to see the referee
awarding Saylor the victory. All the same, it is
doubtful if McCov would have survived the round.
Savior was awaiting him with a meat-axe. It is
said that McCov has devised a guard for the occipital
wallop ; and if he has he can he sure of frantic
applause, as the rabbit-killer is decidedly unpopular
in Sydney. With the exception of Eav, McCov is
the only boxer to 'stay so long against the steel-
wristed Yankee.

Glever, gritty , Tides Dubourg, of France,
badly out-pointed hard-hitting Eddie kcGoorty for
four rounds at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night.
McGoorty hurled some terrific hldws around, but
Jules, mostly by clever footwork, avoided them, or
took them while in full retreat, ..and thereby missed
their sting. McGoorty was cautioned for hitting low,
but no one who knows the man suApects that it was
intentional. He is a scrupulously fair fighter. In
the fifth McGoorty suddenly rushed in close and let
flv a broadside; and Jules, though, he dodged (most of
it. failed to escape it all. What he got temporarily
deprived him of his speed ; and before he could recover
it, the left hook crashed in very heavily. , , It was
more than poor Jules could hear, and he went down
for seven. Immediately he was up McGoorty hanged
him down once more. But the Gaul was full of
sand, and rose no less than four times, onlv to he
sent prone again. He became dazed, and the last,:; time
he went down Angelo Marre decided he had no finance
of recovering from the mule-kicks he had fiui/tained,
and, stopping the fight, awarded McGoortw the top
of the purse. As a scrap there is noL£ni"ch to be
said about it. Dubourg was the better boxer and
more skilful with his feet. But the mass of hardened
moat and bone opposite him disregarded bis straight
lefts as they were thistledown. Elusiveness
was Duhourg’s only safety. And he didn’t elude
sufficiently. It was a triumph of hitting powei; over
boxing sin'll. Had Deho”rg been able to nit as
hard as McGoortv. then historv had told anp f hpr tale.
He landed on McGoorty often enough, hut failed to
make anv impression, and the American simply
waited his opportunity. Tt would he interesting to
know where the United States boxers get their hard-
ness of iaw from, and how it is Hat thev can always
hit so much harder tha*i Australian boxers. Is it
natural toughness as a rcs-dt of having survived
Chicago meat, or is it in the training?
The Mehesran-Welling scrap at ‘'Svdney
Stadium on Saturday night, was not a spectacular
affair that lent itself to descriptive writing, hut a
good, hard-working battle of mighty, savage slogging
Hto s 'des. Mdregan made a wretched start, and
° sprightly Yankee had decidedly the better of
® rst three rounds. Then Mehegan found his
a ’ . anc ‘ . nie t him with heavy counters as he
“ m f Wlth his left, and Welling reeled back-
vvaids after each impact. However, Welling did not
.\e all the reeling to himself. Sometimes they
iceled away from one another. Bi.it Mehegan’s reach
was apparently the longer, and the Yankee got the
worst oi theie exchanges. Also, Mehegan took quite
number of these long-range blows on his gloves
s - tn. the close-range fighting Welling
, emed comparatively helpless to inflict any damage,
ut, on the other hand, he did some beautiful duck-
lng and dodged sudden death repeatedly. Ilalf-way
hi ough the battle the Yankee’s face commenced to
r6a ij I'h’ a , n< w hen Welling rested his countenance
on Mehegans manly shoulder it left a red stain,
tie was unable to escape Mehegan’s long swings, and
be got much the worse of the close-fighting. For
me awful rounds he took in punishment as a sponge
does water. But he never showed a sign of weak-
ness. He was sound to the core. Out-fought, out-
generalled, over-matched, he fought on desperately
against rate and the conquering Australian, and
? V< *r i° ec l ua hse things by increasing the speed,
in chegan for one brief, splendid flash was like
he Mehegan of old—like the boy who went away to
hew Babylon. As he, came in with a quick, snappy
right he flicked aside the left leads of Welling, coun-
Wl ‘ h , h]s own left, and got to close quarters.
Mostly Mehegan failed t,o take advantage of the
demoralisation that followed the turning aside of
those left leads. But he punished Welling terribly
m the close-fighting, till the plucky American hung
on and hugged for safety. Twice the gong sounded
at the psychological moment and deprived Mehegan
°i knock-out when he had the fainting Yankee
absolutely at his mercy. Welling’s great asset was
I' <7 V his splendid power of recuperation,
so that each time he came out Mehegan had to do
ino al if°Tr a i ffa J n# Af I ter shakin £ hands at the open-
-8 of the last round Mehegan let himself go, and
soon had the Yankee in difficulties. He was pro-
ceeding to get all over him when, with about one
minute to go Welling in a wild mix-up, caught
Mehegan right on the point with a short, snappy
hook. Mehegan shook in his tracks ; his knees gave
o u- ca “? ht hls opponent with his gloves and
nulled himself np. And then, with victory staring
him in .the face, amj Mehegan reeling like a top-
heavy shin in a gale, Welling lost his head. He
showered blows like rain, when all that was required
was one well-aimed, well-timed, deliberate wallop.
He caught Mehegan on both sides of the head with
left and right, and the Australian champion reeled
back against the ropes. Away in the Mehegan corner
Duke Mullins, with a face seamed with horror and
anxiety, moved blanched , lips in silent prayer A
nboto of Duke s anguished countenance would have
wn? r W °r th 3 , for * u "®- And all this time Mehegan
was reeling about the ring, smothering up, trying
yainly to recover the power of offence; and Welling
belabored him with useless blows. Sometimes
Hughie s eyes were closed. There were fractions of
seconds when the man was right out, but he was still
on his feetq Suddenly the look of anguish on Duke
Mullins s face eased slightly as the hand of the clock
trembled over the lOsec. mark and a knock-out was
impossible. At _ the same moment there came
a ,.,, anguish from Welling’s corner. And
still Mehegan was on his feet. Then he
clinched, and hung on mightily. Welling swung
f llll }, ™" d ’ , and as his head drooped tried to
land the Saylor occipital blow, but, missing, nearly
Th°^ e hand ovel ; , the t0 P o f Mehegan’s head

The Beauty Experts
WHAT THE BEST OF THEM HAVE
TO SAY ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS
HOME RECIPES.
The Killing of
Superfluous Hair.
“Boudoir Gossip.”
It is easy to remove superfluous hair temporarily,
but to remove it permanently is quite another
matter. Not many women know that for this pur-
pose such a simple substance as powdered pheminol
may be used, applied directly to the hair. The
lecom in ended treatment is designed not merely to
instantly remove the hair, but also to eventually
kid the roots entirely. Almost any chemist could
supply an ounce of pheminol, which quantity should
be sufficient. * * * A simple way to quickly neutral-
ise disagreeable body odors is to dust the armpits
occasionally with powdered (white) pergol. * * *
the use of the natural allacite of orange blossoms
as a greaseless cream is becoming prevalent among
the smartest women. It holds the powder perfectly,
gives a delightful cool finish to the skin, and does
not encourage the growth of hair.
Oxygen as a
Complexion Remover.
“Things One Should Know.”
The latest scientific method of improving the com-
plexion is to “take from it instead of adding to it.”
The idea is to remove, by a gentle process of oxidisa-
tion all the stifling and half-dead accumulations which
adhere to the skin in the form of sallowness, moth
patches, liver spots, etc. The application of merco-
lised wax for a few nights in the same manner that
cold cream is anplied, soon produces marked results.
In contact witli the skin this wax releases free
oxygen, which destroys the waste matter but does
not affect the healthy tissue in the least. The re-
moval of the deadened and disfiguring waste matter
reveals the beautiful young complexion which every
woman has just underneath the stained outer one.
lhe mereolised wax, as supplied by chemist shops, is
perfectly harmless and very beneficial to the skin.
* * * To bring a natural red color to the lips rub
them with a soft stick of prolactum. * * * For
tired, hot or perspiring feet use a teaspoonful of
powdered onalite in a foot bath.
The Magnetism of
Beautiful Hair.
“Applied Arts.”
Beautiful hair adds immensely to the personal mag-
netism of both men and women. Actresses and smart
women are ever on the lookout for any harmless thing
that will increase the natural beauty of their hair.
The latest method is to use pure stallax as a shampoo
on account of the peculiarly glossy, fluffy and wavy
effect which it leaves. As stallax lias never been used
much for this purpose it comes to the chemist only
m sealed original packages, enough for 25 or 30
shampoos. A teaspoonful of the fragrant stallax
granules, dissolved in a cup of hot water, is more
than sufficient for each shampoo. It is very beneficial
and stimulating to the hair, apart from its beautify-
ing effect. * * * For an actual hair-grower nothing
equals pure boranium. It is quite harmless, and sets
the hair roots tingling with new life. * * * The use
of rouge is almost always obvious, but powdered
colliandum gives a perfectly natural color and defies
detection.
The Powder Puff Passes.
“Boudoir Talks.”
Every normal woman is always interested in any
plan by which she can quickly enhance her beauty,
provided the plan is perfectly safe and simple. Ever
since the discovery that ordinary cleminite, such as
any chemist can supply, is ah instantaneous and
harmless beautifier, there has been a growing demand
for it from smart women everywhere. They usually
get about an ounce and add just enough water to
dissolve it. A little of this perfectly harmless lotion
gives a beautiful complexion to any face instantly.
It renders face powder quite unnecessary. Moreover,
its use cannot be detected. The skin is instantlv
beautified, but appears perfectly natural under the
closest scrutiny. * * * To make the eyelashes
grow long, dark and curling, apply a little mennaline
with the finger-tips occasionally. It is absolutely harm-
less and beautifies the eyebrows as well. * * *Pilenta
soap is the most satisfactory for all complexions. It
even works well in cold or hard water.

“Chink’’: I used to think that Shakspeare was a
dull bloke, but I perceive I was wrong. The Bal-
larat Courier printed a bit of his verse the other
day, and I must say it was boshter. Listen:—-
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does makes cows of us all.
“Den” couldn’t write better than that.

“Lamp of Ignorance”: Sydney Daily Telegraph,
the leader and instructor of the people, which says
that Captain Cook discovered Australia, is keeping
up its record for picturesque inaccuracy in fine style.
Last week it published a long letter from its alleged
“special correspondent” in London, in which it was
stated that .John Dillon was “one of the members
for Belfast” ! John has sat steadily for 30 years
for Mayo East, and before that he reclined for
Tipperary. Again, on Tuesday last, the D. T.’s
cable translator or somebody astonished a whole lot
of people by announcing that Ramsay Macdonald, the
fiery Labor person, had been speaking suavely to the
Unionists. Now it is doubtful if Ramsay could
speak suavely to an anointed Unionist gran’ma—it
would be against his principles and his stummick.
Of course it turned out that he hadn’t been talking
suavely to anyone; he had merely been talking at
Staveley—a town of 44,000 inhabitants. Then, on
Friday last, the informative sheet hurried out with
the information that at Vera Cruz (Mexico) “the
secretary of the garrison” had demanded an explana-
tion or something from General Maas, the Federal
commander. 1 suppose the fixer-up-of-submarine-
blither imagined that the American army had waded
into the battle with a roll-top desk and a letter-
press, and was about to conquer the place by sending
out insulting letters barbed with threats of legal
proceedings unless the corpse was paid within seven
days. When Braham, the imported English editor,
arrives, someone will have to take him aside and
thrust into his hand a full D.T. education written on
the back of an envelope. If Braham is allowed to
rush in and start without some such precaution
something will smash in the King-street office.

“Pen-Motor” : I’m not a particularly excitable per-
son, but I would like to do something serious with
my feet to the waltzing barbarian who begins a
paragraph this way: “Lucky were the visiting backers
who escaped to their homes before the last day of
the A.J.C. meeting.” The affectation is spreading.
Last week, I found the following in a little theatri-
cal print: “Dainty and graceful were the five wait-
ing maids.” Then, as if that were not enough for
one day, I found a leader in Sydney D. T. in which
this beautiful passage occurred": “Judge Murray....
made discoveries that will put the anthropologists all
agog." Only a great musician in words could ring
a chime like that!
* * * *
“F.Y.7”: What has become of the real old, dyed-
in-the-waste foreman comp, of the country press?
He has been replaced by a youthful Rechabite who
toys with slugs, “lino” or “mono” ; he has vanished
utterly. Whither, for instance, has Bill Perkins
gone? Bill was foreman of the Beachcomb Banner,
a morning daily which came before a tolerant public
at any time between four and II a.m., as the Fates
and Bill—mostly Bill—decided. Those were the
roaring days in North Queensland, when the Towers
was digging out gold by the ton, and every man’s
thirst was a law unto itself. Bill was invariably
“well on” about midnight. About 1.30 next morning
he was “all in.” It may be said that such an idea
as closing an hotel bar would have roused a revolu-
tion in Beachcomb in those days. Bill, making up
the late matter, was always an interesting sight. As
often as not he would slide his stickful of stuff on to
the stone in perfect fashion.. Just as often a thrilling
society par, or the peroration of an editorial on
“Southern Jealousy” would be sprinkled broadcast.
Bill’s troubles. Sweepihg the wreckage to the floor
with a lordly hand he would use his invariable for-
mula, “Thish wo’ go in t’ ni’.” It never did. The
world of journalism is poorer for Bill’s vanishment.
People of his sort should be immortal.
LAY OF THE WASTE-PAPER BASKET.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mv appetite is ne’er appeased.
I feed on poets’ verses,
And nothing makes me better pleased
Than hearing poets’ curses ;
Their loud revilings are to me
The sweetest music that can be.
An Ode to me is dear indeed,
I sup on Lyrics nightly;
While Serenades are splendid feed,
As, too, are Ballads sprightly;
But most of all I love to eat
An Epic with iambic feet.
Ah, how the great, heroic lines
Slip down my maw, capacious,
My stomach (beg your pardon!) pines
With appetite rapacious,
For long-wrought Epics of great sound
That all the rhythmic laws confound.
The thing that I object to most
Is lack of range in flavor,
For Grey-haircd Mothers served on toast
Each morning lose their savor,
While poems done in praise of Spring
Make me as sick as anything.
And Stockmen’s graves are not the stuff
One wants to choose for daily fare,
A very little is enough
Of Broken Hearts that want repair;
I only wish my poets would
Sing something better understood.
For instance, Lays of Lady Birds
That sigh to stroke an Oyster’s soul!
Or Platypi whose choice of words
Offends a widowed lump of coal;
The aching hanker of a star
To drink pale brandy at the bar.
So many things remain unsung,
I feel like singing them mvsc If—
The gold pyjamas Pharaoh flung
At Mrs. Pharaoh, seeking pelf;
Or any other theme there be
That has the sauce of novelty.
But all in vain. And long before
The Fig Leaf Banner went to press;
With Father Adam, Editor,
And Eve as Fashion Editress,
I’ve heard the same old kind of thing
That poets still prefer to sing.
Yes, here they come—-one Nuptial Song,
Three Lyrics to a Lady’s Eyes;
Sonnets an even hundred strong,
Six Ballads full of Lovers’ Sighs;
And ten Young Ladies weeping tears
About the Wasted Dreams of Years.
I’m chock-a-block and full and sick
Of all the wreckage of the Muses,
And yet, no matter how I kick,
Fate other job to me refuses;
So all I ask, and loud I ask it
Don’t overwork the poor old “Basket.”
MAORI LAND,
KUSCOBIN.

lished. At the. top is James A. Bailey, showman,
aged 59, who left £400,000 ; : at the bottom, Oscar
Wilde, aged 44, who left £lOO. Others noted are

“The Oldest Inhabitant”: The late John Bennett
is said to have had “a. great fright” .over G. V.
Brooke one night at Lamplough (Vic.). John was
in front as manager arid looking after the “toll.”
Someone came and told him that Brooke was se
drunk that he could not get along. Bennett rushed
behind and ordered the curtain down. Then he
discovered Brooke perfectly sober. The paragrapher
tells us the play was “David Garrick,” and Brooke
Was playing the drunk scene to the life. Bennett
said that Brooke told him he had paid him the
greatest compliment of his life. If John Bennett
ever told any paragraphed this yarn his memory
must have gene broke in his last days, for he Was
never a liar, nor was he any semblance of one. As
a mater of cold fact, Brooke left Austrlaia in 1861,
and “David Garrick” was not produced until April
30, 1864, when Sothern played the name part at
London Haymarket.
lan Penny, seemingly, has left the Oscar Asche co.
Somebody else is playing the part of Nasir, the Guide,
in “Kismet,” and the new man’s pronunciation of the
word purse—“l saw no puurse” —is doubtless dif-
ferent from Penny’s. It is to be hoped that lan,
under some management or other, will turn up again
in Australia like a good Penny, His figure was manly
and beautifully-tanned, though his smile and glances
reminded one of a maiden in her teens. He used to
oil his figure and lie on the beach to get brown, and
the girls saw that he was good. He had the sweetest
devices for keeping himself fit. One day a friend
met him panting in Collins-street, Melbourne. lan
had lo§t his hat, the wind was whistling through his
hair, the glow of health was in his cheek and his
eye sparkled like a bookmaker’s diamond ring. “Oh,”
cried lan, “I’ve had a lovely time—chasing a leaf.’’
Ethel Irving intends to play La Tosca the next
time she goes into management. Of all the charac-
ters that Sardou wrote for Sarah Bernhardt, the
character ef the sportive, jealous prima donna, con-
verted into a tigress by Baron Scarpia, is the one
in which Ethel Irving should be able to shine brighter
than Sarah ever shone. She may lack a little of
the Frenchwoman’s power to simulate ferocity, but
their are more facets to her brilliant art.
“Busk”: A little explanation about the row over
the production in Westport, Ireland, of Vicar Han-
nay’s farce Called “General John Regan.” Harrnay
was vicar of Westport, but he skied the holy wipe or
threw in the towel of the Church when his.. farce
yielded him a fortune through its production in Eng-
land and the United States. The plot revolves around
a statue being put up in Balleymahooley to General
John Regan, a supposed citizen who never existed.
A Yankee brings the yarn of Regan being a great
general in South America. An attempt was made to
act the play in Westport, but the actors and actresses
were hooted and booted out of the town. Here is the
sting of the affair. Westnort has a statue to one of
its citizens named Glendinning, a truly noble man, and
the greatest benefactor of the town. Yet the exquisitely
mean Hannav builds his rubbish on this fact He
has been exploiting the euriositv of the London pub-
lic by! lecturing there on the Stage Irishman. If he
showed his holv mug in Westport they would string
huh up alongside the statue.;
Stms'p old-fashioned “Lights o’ London” had a
remarkable revival in London this month. The
drama was set going at the Aldwvch Theatre; it was
put .on the screen again at the picture theatres,>and
was published in serial form in Answers, with the
film illustrations. -■£'.
“Stargazer”; The commercial . film displavs the
marked Tory proclivities of the: commercial drama,
with the result that we have been having a painful
over-dose of Carson of late. Carson’s habit of
getting ih the way of the cimematographic operator
the marked theatricality of his “great ad-
venture ’ in the eastern bit of Ulster. And the
labels: “Sir Edward Carson Leading his Troops!”
“Sir Edward Carson Engaged upon his Noble Patri-
otic Work in Ulster!” If one or two of the audience
venture any appreciative handiwork there wells a
harsh roar of disapproval from the bulk of the
audience. Carson mav be a hero in England, where
he signs himself rovally “Edward,” in his Orange
mandates, but at this distance he looks a pigmy
jumping-iack. who continues to exist by the tolerance
Of a rather futile Ministry.
A young Melbourne lady of 20 who applied for a
position in a theatrical co. the other day, admitted
she had no particular talent, no training and no
experience. “But;” she said, “I feel sure-my beauty
will carry me through.” No engagement was forth-
coming, and, on leaving, the young lady said: “Well,
-Mr.—— «- r l— can assure .you_of one thing. Neither qj_v
mamma, my papa, nor myself will ever go inside yqur
theatre again,”
SWOLLEN SINGERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
The highest notes come out with the same comfort
and ease as the lower, and without any tightening
and swelling of the neck muscles, or rush of blood
to the head. Moreover, what is popularly known as
the “break” in the voice automatically disappears,
and the voice remains perfectly even in quality from
top to bottom, the often gruesome boom of the idiotic
“chest-notes” disappearing, and changing to the
sweet, bright quality of the upper voice.— Marshall
flail, enthusiastically re latest improved method cf
voice-production.
When I attended concerts first
I feared to see the tenor burst.
The way his face and full, round throat r
Would swell, when to a wild top-note
He shrieked his thin, uncertain way
(Thus making his artistic hay),
Depressed me till I had to curse.
But bassos were a trifle worse.
Upon their chests they’d drop their jowls
And fetch up hollow graveyard howls
Through mouths that looked like open vaults.
But all the bad artistic faults
Were encored by the bare-backed squaws
Who sat and yearned and made applause.
And I remember, here and there
Sat patient men without much hair
Who stayed because they had been brought
To hear the “singers” scream and snort.
They were not devotees, jmu bet,
But hated well the long-hai-ed set.
Yet they liked music, though each song
Seemed to their humble ears all wrong.
But such disloyal ones lay low,
They were not “musical.” Oh, no!
They took their wives and sought the door,
Thanking their gods that it w’as o’er,
And puzzled why it was they should
So hate all music that was “good.”
And now they’ve done their .concert flight,
We know their instinct was quite right,
And every bygone hound that yelped
The sacred cause of Music helped.
In life or science—art or song,
What isn’t natural is wrong.
The singer long, or short and fat,
Should think each day beneath his hat:
“Let’s see! Should Igo on like that V’

Never before in the experience of Australia were so many diamonds sold as last year. Our
sales were enormously large. „
WHY .
Well we some years ago, took on a Sole Agencv calling for an enormous output, and 1o
live up to it we decided to offer diamonds at merely a broker's commission above cutters’ landed
The first year it did not pan out too well; the second year the very large output told, and
so we are continuing the experiment for another year.
We only sell the Higher Grade of Diamonds, but our prices are lower than those of London.

R. .T. Cassidy, Queensland’s Rhodes
scholar at Oxford for 1913, writes concern-
ing the ways of that cultured institution
At about 11.30 any “debagging" that may. be con-
templated takes place. If any man (particularly a
“fresher”) has made himself objectionable, a crowd
of men rush him and tear his nether garments from
him to shreds. Some men of third and fourth year
have quite a wonderful collection of trophies from
such encounters. Only one victim was “debagged”
last term, and it wasr a weird and wonderful sight.
So the Gentlemen of England trot round
with fragments of their fellow-gentleman’s
pants hanging from tlieir girdles like Indian
.scalps, or suspended in their rooms like the
skulls of the Dyak head-hunter. According
to a Cornish miner the writer once knew,
the great advantage of being a good man is
that you can afford to do worse things than
if you were a bad man. Similarly, it seems,
the advantage of being a gentleman is that
you can afford to be a worse rough than
you could if you were merely a rough.
At the Bundaherg Eight-Hour celebration
Harry Coyne, M.L.A., of tramway strike
fame, outlined his picture of the Labor
policy. According to Coyne, the Labor party,
"having woti an eight-hour day, is now fight-
ing for a six-liour day, nor would it stop
there. It was going to continue till it obtained
a four-hour day, and, better still—its ultimate
objective—universal equality.” Meantime
Coyne’s fellow-Laborites are piling, up foreign
debt, which means interest to the outsider ;
and that interest has to be paid in goods,
valued not at the local price but at whatever
price some misguided 10-hour-a-day foreigner
is prepared to supply similar goods. One
reason why a four-hour day is becoming
more and more hopeless is that this interest-
burden grows heavier and heavier. And a
reason why it ought to be hopeless is that
there are so many things the worker might
have, with 24 hours to earn them in, that
to knock off at the end of four hours is sim-
ply throwing away chances of getting the
good things. As for “universal equality”—
well, Coyne may pine for equality with .Tap,
Chow. Hindu and Kanaka; but the intelli-
gent Laborite doesn’t.
A BAD RECORD.
D RUNK: “I pleads bein’ a hit drunk , yer Washup .”
POLICE M AGISTRATE: “Prisoner known to the police , constable?"
CONSTABLE R YAN: “Indade he is, sor: he’s been here foive toimes for bein' robbed an '
twoice for bein' assaulted wid wiolence."
In these days of political rowdyism and
intolerance, bred by a. too broad franchise
(see Tory press), it is refreshing to recall
how they ran things under the good old
squatter regime of 42 years ago. Here’s an
extract from the Rockhampton Bulletin’s
report. April. 1572, of an election meeting:
. Mr. Palmer: “You are a damned set of Rockhamp-
ton rowdies. I don’t care a curse for the lot of
v0u.... Booh ! You’re afraid of me You’re a
d—d se t of wretches. By God, you are! (Tumult.)
Bah, you brutes. Come up here, you d —d beasts.
What the h—l do 1 care for you ?”....
At a later stage of the proceedings -
“You’re a d— d set of fools. Sit down, you ——
What the h—l do I care for the lot of
you? You are the ugliest lot of blackguaids 1
ever looked at.” Mr. Palmer then jumped from the
platform on to the reporters’ table, and threw him-
self headfirst in the crowd. He was; lifted on
the shoulders of the people and carried to the end
of the hall, where he was dropped on . the floor full
length. A rush was made towards hint, and he
was dragged awav and prevailed on to leave the
hall.
Palmer was at that time Premier qf Queens-
land. and was a fair example in his virtues
and his vices, of a type of politician to
whom the Tory press continually looks lov-
ingly back as it sighs, “Ah! Them was the
days!” Refinement and culture were, of
course, the hall-mark of the leading men in
the ante-Democratic era.
“McNorth”: Mornington Island, the last
remaining spot in Queensland where the nig-
ger pursues the bandicoot and wild bee in
Arcadian ignorance of rum and religion, is
to be handed over to the missionary. It
will be the end of Binghi. Long experience
has shown that if our paleolithic brother
is to be preserved he must be left alone. He
cannot, jump from his Stone-Age existence
to the conditions of the present time and sur-
vive. Of course, he may not be worth pre-
serving—except as a curio, or a relic of an
ancient race, whatever good that may be—
but if we are going to try and save him at all
why not let him remain in his natural state
of innocence as regards European clothes,
vices, drinks, tobacco, food and religion i
A simple and inexpensive means of achieving
such a purpose would be to declare the island
a reserve for all time and warn off it perma-
nently the lustful Jap, the white combo and
the interfering missionary. Once a mission
station is established, the nigger will become
a cringing, inebriated dependent. And pre-
sently he will go the way of the rest of his
brethren, and the Aborigines Protection De-
partment will be supplied with another just
cause why it should call itself a gigantic
failure.
The current superstition that N. Queens-
land has become a white man’s country is
not altogether correct. A recent press re-
port from up there asserts that evidence for
the prosecution was given by Lee Buck,
Goon Yow, Duck Chuck, Chong Mun, Ah
Hoy, Wong Ken, Goon Tun, Quay Sun, Gow
Son, Low Jew and George. Observe that
George (a possible Caucasian) comes in at
the tail end as if he were heartily ashamed
of himself. There was nothing to show
what happened to the hapless defendant
when Lee Buck, Duck Chuck and the rest of
the crowd had done with him on the altar of
the murdered rooster and the obliterated
lucifer. Probably he went up in smoke.
“Teller”: What a thrifty race Queens-
landers are becoming ! The State ; Savings
Bank numbers 173,000 depositors (but of a
total population of about 670,000), and the
month of April recorded £40,000 more of
deposits than did April of the year 1913.
Even the Q. aboriginal is saving money.
There are scores of blacks on the reserva-
tions whose deposits run from £lO to a
couple of hundreds. (This takes no account
of Jerry Jerome, whose bank account is well
into the four figures.) The early Banana-
lander was a hard-drinking, reckless; im-
provident, generous battler ; the modern one
is temperate, cautious, thrifty, keen, yet
still a lover of the open air, exercise and
amusements.
The Kiss.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
How she clung!
I have scarcely grown wise, though 1 no
more am young,
For still 1 remember the star-studded skies,
The long, moony seas and the star of her
eyes—
The wave, one side moonshine, and one
ridged and dark
As it went with the boat like the shape of
a shark,
The mounds laced with foam, of a malachite
SG£L
The White City’s uplift through the lull s
mystery, \
And Manly behind us and Sydney before
And the gloat of the tides as they ravished
the shore.
It was Chance we should ' take the same
boat to the town
(That, vagrant whose staff heats our des-
tiny down).
Chance she stood by the rail, with her gaze
on the sea.
Chance —the man that she found in the
shadow was me!
What were her eyes like: In their color 1
mean? . _
They , were Heaven and Hell, with an earth-
link between.
Her name? Some frail flower thing, fool-
ish and small.
My mind holds the girl, but her name not at
all!
Away in the, cabin they tinkled a tune,
Some thin ragtime music that mocked at
the moon,
And it throbbed to a tango, grotesque —and
yet sweet,
Where in weird syncopation you hear the
blood beat!
We were crossing the Heads on the curtsey-
ing boat —
We were tossed as the drift that the flood •
sets afloat —
From the bows someone flung out a half-
burned cigar
And it flicked o’er the side like the trail ,
of a star !
The moon, caught the warning of sails white
and slant.
The vmices of yachting men rose in a chant,
•Some nude thing ■of venturer and' women,
and wine.
And the breath of a woman was mingled
with mine. ’
There must have been heliotrope' tucked in
her belt.
For the whiff of a garden of lilac I smelt
(There —steady, old boat, how it rollicks
and dips!)
But the flower of all flowers did I pluck
from her lips.
Now Sydney grew out of the wave and the
land.
A trite Parting word —and a hand touch on
hand—
The clattering gangway—the fluttering
light— ,
A white face set sliorewards and lost in the
night!
As a matter of duty. I kiss every day
With lips that are dry and a heart far
away:
As a matter of duty, am kissed in return;
O Memory mouth, how you quiver and burn !
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, May 23, 1914.
My Bear Thabgomixdaii,—
Ex-Speaker Cowley’s sister, Mrs. Royston,
of London, is in Brisbane at present, and the
local aristocracy took tea with her yesterday.
Lady Macgregor and the Vision were there,
both wearing black, the former’s gown com-
posed of velvet and the latter’s of crepe de
chine.
Ellen Terry arrived here on Wednesday,
gave lectures on Thursday evening and this
evening, and leaves by to-morrow’s man
train. The Exhibition Hall was crowded
on Thursday, and when she appeared the
entire audience rose and made a great noise.
She wore flame-colored crepe de chine, and
looked very handsome against the dull green
curtain that was hung across the
stage. Armfuls of flowers were sent up.
To-night the hall was not quite so prosper-
ous, but sufficiently so to prevent the mana-
gers from falling on one another with lamen-
tations.
Joseph Blasciieek. who is an old favorite
here, put his talents to the programme with
credit to his reputation, and Nina r orbes
and Gladys McDowell sang pleasingly.
On Wednesday night the Australian
Trained Nurses’ Association gathered to-
gether and forced upon Miss Hunter, the
departing secretary, a silver tea and c'ofleo
service. Dr. McLean did the presenting,
and most of Brisbane’s other medicoes were
gathered together to confirm his honeyed
remarks. The lady leaves almost imme-
diately for a trip across the world.
Mr. and Mrs. W. Schock fed. about 50
friends at Cafe Eschenhagen to-night, as a
slight tribute of respect to the 25th anniver-
sary of their wedding day. There were lots
of speeches and lots of supper and lots ol
pretty girls and lots of good wishes. Any-
body who hankers for more than that at a
sitting deserves to live in a dog-kennel and
be fed on salted bones.
Barrister J. WoOleock and pretty Miss
Ida Withrington announced their engage-
ment this week. The knot-tying will take
place next Wednesday, at St. John s Angli-
can Cathedral. As an extra novelty the
time fixed is 8.30 a.m. Maybe this is a new
way of getting even with the persistent
uninvited guest.
Veteran J. L. Wassell lent his garden to
the St. George Society to-day, so that that
alien body might try a lawn party by way
of swelling its bank account. Judging by
the pleased look of the secretary, the dragon
of bankruptcy was ruthlessly slain and
thrown into the adjoining allotment.
The Albion I’ark races to-day brought out
all the chronic course haunters. Mrs. Blume,
in a swagger imported gown and a hat
hidden under a rose-colored ostrich feather,
was conspicuous in the procession on the
lawn ; and Mrs. Stuart Ilyslop and her hand-
some mother, Mrs. George Raff, were also
features of the landscape, Mrs. Stanley
Chapman looked cosy in musquash furs and
blue crepe de chine.
* The Brisbane Musical Cnion beat all its
previous records by a good length on Tues-
day night, when it chanted or warbled a lale
of' Old Japan.” Mrs. Gilbert W r ilson draped
her stately figure in hydrangea-blue char-
meuse, with an overdress of hand-painted
chiffon ; and Lena Hammond, the other female
soloist, wore something very pretty, the
ingredients of which were mauve satin and
maize-colored ninon. “Billy” Crisp and
Percy Mackay were the other principals.
The jigs of the week include a chrysan-
themum Cinderella dance, one organised by
the South Brisbane Ladies’ Swimming Club
(which gyrated to-night in between accepting
the prizes won during the season), and Miss
St. Ledger’s dance on Wednesday.
Members o$ the Commercial Travellers’
Club entertained their lady friends to-night.
The Black and White Pierrots provided the
songandance part of the show. President
Bowcher and his wife —the latter-arrayed in
apricot charmeuse —gave the charmed-to-see-
vou hand to all the guests, and secretary
Courtney Luck hovered genially in the firing
line.
Yours affectionately,
Australia
JANE.

New Preparation
Causes Big Scare Among Hair Specialists.
My True Hair Grower has a most wonder-
ful effect upon the hair glands and tissues
of the scalp. It is the only remedy for the
hair ever discovered that is similar to the
natural hair foods or liquids of the scalp.
It penetrates the pores quickly, and the
hair soon shows the effects of its wonder-
fully exhilarating and life-producing quali-
ties.
Besides being a True Hair Grower, ray
preparation quickly removes DANDRUFF,
and stops FALLING HAIR and ITCHING.
It is known the world over, and I have in
my consulting-rooms upwards of 3000 grate-
ful letters from men and women who have
derived so much benefit from the use of my
True Hair Grower as to compel them to
write and thank me.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES!
Having such complete confidence in this compound, I am offering a
trial box to anyone interested. Send in your name and full address, to-
gether with three penny stamps for postage, etc.

knowledge: is power
Thirty years of assiduous study of The Hair and its Treatment, and all
Capillary Diseases as they affect the Scalp and Hair, have given me the means
of Preserving the Hair, and producing a new growth, after all other preparations
have failed.
Mr Fred Peakman, of Wairoa, New Zealand, is another wonderful case. His hairdresser tells me
he had not a scrap of hair, and now, after a few months’ treatment with my preparations, he has
got a splendid growth of hair. .
Mr. O’Rourke, Wee Waa, New South Wales, writes: “My head, which was nearly ba.d, lias now
come back to its usual growth.”
Mr. Sutherland states: “I had only a little down on my head when I commenced to use your
SPECIAL PARASENE and COSMO LOTION ; now I have a beautiful head of hair.
Gentlemen who are going bald should use Special Parasene and CosniO Lotion, one at
night and the other in the morning, and wash the head once a week with Shampuiia.
Price (with postage, two months’ treatment): Victoria, 12/-; four months, 22/6. Other
States, 12/6 and 23/6.
Ladies with hair falling out should apply Restorer at night, and Cosmo Lotion in the
morning, and wash the head as often as necessary with Shampuna.

Kurow: You are a bad guesser. (1) The
editor of The Bulletin never ornamented or infested
the staff of any London paper in his youth. He
learned his art under William Mcllwraith, of Rock-
hampton. If he isn’t as good an editor as he should
be it is his fault —not the fault of the old man at
Rockhampton. (2) The founder and first editor of
The Bulletin was born in Australia, and acquired
his knowledge of journalism there. He had no
London training to start with, and he got on quite
well without it. (3) Nobody on the present staff
graduated on the London press. (4) Who are you?
Several letters have arrived of late containing a polite
thirst for information about the personnel of The
Bulletin staff. If you are seeking material for per-
sonal paragraphs—well, in our private capacity we
are all as ordinary and uninteresting as a mile of
tripe. If you are a beautiful and accomplished girl
of boundless wealth who has been informed that
there is an eligible bachelor on the staff —well, there
is no such bachelor. Still, you can come along and
inspect. If you are a harassed boardinghouse-keeper,
and someone has got hash from you on credit by
pretending that he was Smithbrownjohnson of this
paper and you are trying to locate your bad debt,
we would as soon pay the 17s. 6d. and be done with
the matter. If you are a detective seeking in a side-
long fashion for evidence to support a charge of
bigamy, desertion, child abandonment or breach of
promise, the Religious Editor will fight the case to
the last ditch John White: When unionism is com-
pulsory and universal, and all the unions unite, as
you suggest, the possibility is that it will be the
same as if every R.C. priest was Pope at Rome, and
every Greek priest was Patriarch at Constantinople,
and every Anglican curate was Archbishop of Canter-
bury. This is only a theory. We don’t see that
anybody can tell what the result may be, or that it
matters much. Suppose you give up vain specula-
tions and remove the debris from your backyard. You
write after the manner of a man who has a back-
yard with much debris in it. . . .11.G.5.: So
that alderman who proposed to buy two gondolas
for the artificial lake in the park and “let them breed”
has happened ayain. He has been happening very
numerously for a long time. If you send him along
any more the Religious Editor will take a ticket and
an axe for your town. Having arrived there he will
kill you and all your family, including your three
wives and three mothers-in-law. Then he will burn
down your house, and sow the site with salt, and
throw your dog and your cat over the tank, and
drown your horse, and insert a sixpenny advt. in the
local paper stating that the name of Smith is
accursed. .. .Phyllis Feedbag: We gather from your
letter that The Bulletin consits of (I) “insane
twaddle”; (2) “piffle”; (3) “coarse outrage”; (4)
that it “earns the contempt of every decent-minded
person” ; (5) that it is “decadent,” a “non-thinker,”
“stodge,” a “dog-fight,” and that it “skulks” and
publishes “abuse.” Bless you, child, we have had
heaps of worse things than that said about us. Why
don’t you get a hustle on you? (N.B. —Just noticed
your remark about our “sullied columns.”)... .R. J.
Salute: We loathe to dim the simple, hound-like worship
which you evidently entertain for Mr. Fred Levins, of
Balaclava (Vic.), but that electioneering repartee re
voluntarily swallowing the dose of poison dates from
the Pocket Borough period. Bucolic candidates in
those early days paid ladies a fixed fee to arise in
the crowd and remark: “If you was my husband, I
would give you a dose of poison.” Then came the
impromptu repartee, quick as lightning. The little
turn went very well a century ag0.... Pat: His
address is 38 Marlborough Hill, St. John’s Wood,
N.W. London, England. .. .W.M.: Keeping an eye on
it. . . .R.T. (S.A.) : “Passing of Parkes” is included
in E. J. Brady’s book, “Ways of Many Waters.”....
Nationalisation: (1) Balance-sheets of that concern
are not available: shares are not quoted on the
market. (2) A shareholder can’t sell a better title
than he has g0t....A.8.: Very unlikely that that
firm intends to enter the cino. business or ever seri-
ously thought of it.... Tom R.: Feeble, kittenish,
fig-leaf rhyme.... The Brute: No name or address
on verses, which look as if they might be of foreign
magazine extraction. In any case they are not very
dazzling verses. .. .R.B.P. (Q.) : Plain brown
rhymes... .Jas. P. McE.: You’re too heavy on your
feet.... Shakspeare the Second: Thanks, but it’s too
beautiful for print. .. .J.M. : You get the atmosphere
of the bush, and the publican is well drawn; but
Australian literature has already enough bush pubs
and publicans. The story isn’t well t01d.... Ivadaw:
No use putting chestnuts into verse. . . .E.J.D.: Don’t
care for that snip-snap stuff.... Bvron T.: “Beware,
sweet maid, sin’s snare is near.” Get out; you
hiss like a snake.... Maire: Got that same story
early this week. .. .S.R.C.: Too disjointed and
gory... .A.C.J.: Cohen isn’t a story... .L.H.: The
two poems are not worthy, and your hopes are
dashed... .Hugh D. S.: “Enclosed please find a few
lines scratched down this wet afternoon.” Right! :
A REFLECTION.
The pines stand out, gaunt shadows ’gainst the sky,
Masses of dull cloud move overhead,
So slowly move it scarce doth met the eye,
While seawards grey is edged with red.
The air is filled with mist that hangs a pall,
Not thick, naught obscured, but dulled I see.
A calm which seems so om’nous covers all.
What after-fate beareth it for me?
Wilt thou break with a monstrous clang,
Wilt crack like the summons to doom,
Or quietly fade o’er the water from me
And pass with scorn for us here
A calm breathing space in a life
A pause in hurrying affairs
What comes after —-who knows? Is’t strife?
The present we live for—who cares?
Let us shout, laugh, dance, let us sing.
The world is but ours for a span
Scan the future, let man have his fling
What is fate? —why but fate —not man.
Do you have to sort yourself out like that every
time the weather breaks down, or are you surging
always with deep, tumultuous thoughts? Your
poems eontain so many queries that it might be
more satisfactory if you addressed them to tourist
bureaux. Government tourist officers just love to be
asked questions. The more you try to puzzle and
annoy them, the more affable they get. Try one of
your soul-searchers on one of the tribe. You are
bound to get some sort of reply, evpn if it is only a
picture of a snow-capped mountain and a coach
time-table... .Adam T. (Tas.) : It was a good gag,
but there is no necessity to have it agSain in
verse. .. .Charles F.P.: Neither. .. .Will J. (V.):
Don’t care for your wail. Life has a few good
lines: Lydia P. F.: No, no !. .. .Scribbler: Do you
want us to write a treatise on the dashed thing?
Forget it.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Emro: If it was taken from real life, you have
hidden the theft cleverly... .F.N.: Don’t care for
them, and, anyhow, we’ve had a horrible Niagara
of Meat Trust pictures this week.... Ronald S.: A
boy dressed like that would stand a good chance cf
being stoned in Sydney. Where did you get him —
out of an English paper? W.H.D.: There never
was a small boy like the one in your drawing—
people simply wouldn’t allow it....5.V.: The “im-
pression” is of a rather graceful lady, but it might
be any lady with a decent waist measurement. And
it isn’t a first-class impression. .. .C.R.C.: One gag
is old and the other must suffer for being found in
its company. Drawings hopelessly w00den..... Frank.
Noo: You set yourself a difficult job and it beat you
easily.... Lind C.: One of them is the lat,ehP.ope
Leo XIII'. in G.-G. Muhro-Ferguson’s , ■'uniforip.
Can’t guess what the other picture, is,_*.. v ß.S.: A
procession of politicians should not look iike a string
of d —d 50u15.... Mandel: A bit late, also a bit
wooden and rather dreary. ... B.: You were under the
influence of another artist when you did that slum
sketch.

ON BABY’S FACE
Almost Covered that Part of Face,
Festered and Inflamed, Also On
Fingers and Knee, Used Cuti-
cura Soap and Ointment, Face
Now Quite Healthy,
“ Wando,” Wilby Wilby, N. S. W.—“My
baby’s chin broke out in the form of a
pimple and gradually spread until the sore
almost covered that part of her face. It
would fester and all become inflamed.
There were also the same sores on her fingers
and knee. I tried several remedies without
success. One day I saw an advertisement
for the Cuticura Remedies, so I got some
Cuticura Ointment, which I used along with
Cuticura Soap, which I had been using for
two years, and in four days I could notice a
vast difference, and now after three weeks
my baby’s face is quite healthy. I think
Cuticura Soap and Ointment splendid for
the skin and hair.” (Signed) Mrs. L. M.
Cook, January 7, 19i3.
FOR PIMPLES AND BLACKHEADS
The following is a most effective and eco-
nomical treatment: Gently smear the af-
fected parts with Cuticura Ointment, on the
end of the Anger, but do not rub. Wash off
the Cuticura Ointment in Ave minutes with
Cuticura Soap and hot water and continue
bathing for some minutes. This treatment
is best on rising and retiring. At other times
use Cuticura Soap freely for the toilet and
bath, to assist in preventing inAammation,
irritation and clogging of the pores, the
common cause of these distressing eruptions.
Cuticura Soap and Cuticura Ointment are
sold throughout the world. Liberal sample
of each mailed free, with 32-p. Skin Book.

CATARRH CENTRES OF THE HEAD\
” Kat-ar-ah " Treatment provides an enlarged
Supply of medicated air to soothe and heat
these discharging surfaced.
THE MENACE OF
CATARRH!
There are few human ailments which create such
discomfort and misery as Catarrh —the mother of
all disease. It pursues you at work and at play;
it is with you everywhere, threatening Deafness,
Throat Diseases, Bronchitis, Asthma, Dyspepsia,
Neuritis and Consumption; making you down-
hearted, ruining your hopes, wrecking your life
and holding the weapon of greater suffering
always before you.
Those offensive discharges from the nose, the partial loss of
hearing, the irritating head-noises, the dry “ stopped-up ” feel-
ing in the nostrils, the constant sneezing, the husky throat, the
frequent headaches, the continual hawking and spitting to dislodge
the mucous secretions, the heavy tired feeling when you awake —
these symptoms are as nothing compared with the fact that you are
inviting the entry of some worse affliction if you neglect Catarrh.
Free to Sufferers.
To ail who are afflicted with Catarrh in any form I offer a FREE
TRIAL of “Kat-ar-ah” Inhalant. It gives immediate relief to
the inflamed membranes, clears the head, nose, throat and
lungs, conveys health-giving, purifying and germ-destroying
medicated air to the affected parts and cleanses the nasal
passages of accumulated mucous. No matter how many remedies
you may have tried do not consider your case hopeless until
you have tried “ Kat-ar-ah” Treatment.
When writing give your full name and address; be sure to
mention this paper, and enclose 3d. in stamps to cover cost of
postage. The Trial Bottle will be sent you by return mail,
together with a copy of my new and interesting booklet: “Catarrh
—its Cause, Symptoms and Treatment.”

For such troubles as Constipation, Biliousness, Indigestion,
Torpid Liver, Hemorrhoids and kindred ills, Hunyadi Janos
is of great value. It promptly and thoroughly cleanses
the system of all effete matter if taken regnlarly in doses of a
wine-glassful each morning before breakfast. Its free action
upon the intestines has the happy effect of giving relief in an
almost instantaneous way.

“0.K.”: May I be permitted to say that these
continued howls at me for having remarked upon the
handiness of a small quick-firing weapon for murder
purposes are getting a bit too thick. My latest
assailant who may be the same assailant as
before, starts with a misstatement. He gives no evi-
dence in support of it. He says, “When ‘O.K.’ talks
of Madame Caillaux’s use of a revolver he talks
through his hat, and when he praises the accuracy
of that effete weapon—-well, he simply gibbers,” The
fact of the matter is that “H. 1.0.” simply fibbers to
get an excuse for “gibbers.” I didn’t “praise the
accuracy” of anybody’s revolver, or deny the accu-
racy, for aiming purposes, of old-time pistols (as in a
previous attackful paragraph I was accused of doing).
I said that Madame Caillaux was able to get close
to the editor <she fired at owing to her small revolver
being concealed in her muff, and I remarked that
she was able to kill him because the weapon per-
mitted of her getting four bullets, or five bullets,
into her human target. She was firing at very short
range and one bullet hit the bull’s-eye or the ox-tail or
whatever my commentators like to call it. As to whether
the weapon was a “revolver” or an “automatic pistol”
I know not. The cable report of the murder said
“revolver.” If Madame used a weapon, in the work-
ing whereof - there is no revolution of a cylinder,
she didn’t use a revolver. The cable, in that case,
was as inaccurate as “H. 1.0.” But if there was a
revolution of a certain-part, or parts, of the weapon
aforesaid, she must have used an up-to-date revolver,
no matter whether it be called an “automatic pistol”
or a little gun. Revolvers have been advancing in
ingenuity all the time. They were doubly automatic
40 years ago. In the self-acting revolver the cylinder
revolved and the hammer rose and fell by the action
of the trigger. You pulled the trigger only until all
the chambers of the cylinder were emptied.. The old
revolver was, in fact, an automatic pistol, and
Madame could have killed any ordinary editor with
it. I don’t pretend to say what is the best weapon
for extraordinary editors.
A few members of the Vic. Burglars’ Union
observed the other day that all suburban railway sta-
tions, except those where goods are unloaded and
shunting takes place, are left unattended from 11
p.m. on Sunday till 5 a.m. on Monday. So they got
the Rolls-Royce out of the garage and began opera-
tions on the Camberwell line. Starting at East Cam-
berwell, they burgled seven consecutive unattended
booking offices, right up to Mitcham. The net yield
failed to pay for the petrol expended—much less
cover the wear and tear of tools, loss of time, damage
done to tyres, etc. In fact, to tell the painful and
sordid truth, it panned out at 10s. 6d. and four
stamps. It transpired that the Commissioners had
taken the precaution to remove all the cash worth
mentioning on the general principle that in Victoria
whatever is left lying round casually is liable to be
adopted by malefactors. The feelings of the police
have been rather hurt by the discovery, that this
system is in operation ; still, they admit that it has
its redeeming features. The more portable assets
people lock away in strong rooms the more time and
opportunity the Force gets for repose.
MOTHS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Six hundred cases of Nelson peaches, part of a
trial shipment of fresh fruit from Maoriland to
California, were condemned at San Francisco, owing
to an unknown moth. —News item.
Do we ever suffer from moths, camerados?
Beleagured by the cares of business and the Cost of
Living, many of us cannot- spare the time to
suffer from moths; still
In this world the animals get at us when we least
expect it 1
I do not refer to the kind “Ouida” wrote of;
They are more the kind -we get at;
But the moths of Maoriland;
And the moths of Scripture—
The moths that break through and steal, camerados!
The carper-moth, and the eodlin-moth, and the
Unknown Moth of Maoriland are the offspring
of dark, dust, damp, decay and desolation. ' \
There are also other Unknown Moths, camerados.
Ah, in the warp and the web of nations they
make their home after many years!
Some there be who say, “There are no flies-on US!”
Nevertheless, while boasting, there the moths have
entered in! ~
In trade and commerce and industry; aye! and in
the arts of Peace and War, they may be found
in myriads.
In the fabric of the nation lie concealed the gnaw-
ing pupa, of the insects of corruption and dis-
integration.
From the tomb of Aahmes they dragged into the
light of day the 8000-years : old Moths of Egypt.
In the cloth-of-gold robes of the dead Cambyses the
Moths of Persia laid their eggs.
He, who, in the names of Freedom and the Old
Religion, began the Sacred Wars of Greece, saw
the hatching of-the'pup®-of the Moths of that
Empire.
When they burned the corse of Alexander the Great
they could not burn the eggs of the Moths of
Greece!
At the Battle of Metaurus the body of the young
Hasdrubal was found pierced with many wounds,
and under his dinted armor the Moths of Car-
thage fed upon his clothing.
Rome —Imperial Rome —acclaimed the assassins of
Caesar, seeing not in his blanky toga that the
Moths of Time wrought secretly therein against
the Divine City!
Byzantium hatched out legions of moths unwit-
tingly, and the Caliphate of Bagdad, amid all
its silk curtains, was unaware of that which
battened therein!
The Angevins and the mediaeval Empires did not know
until it was too late, that the Moths had got itt
to their arras and .tapestry.
In the Venetian lutestrings, and in the Spanish
cloth, these creatures ravaged unsuspected.
Over the gallant brocaderie of France the puprt
crawled until they reached Sedan ;
Are we not wondering if the Moths of Time have
brought forth their legions in the good English
broadcloth ?
And for us, here, camerados? —
Let us be certain that in our new garments the
Australian Moths are not breeding to our
destruction !
Sloth, extravagance, greed, indifference, acquiescence,
blindness, superstition, public doles and private
corruption—these are the Moths of Time,
cam erados !
These devour the Robe of Empire and the fabric of
Nationhood !
The Unknown creature ,is known —it is the Creature
that breaks through and steals away the fibre
of a People.
Moths on peaches ? Bah !
These can be fumigated—liquidated—obliterated !
But those that disintegrate the fabric of the Empire,
and of the Republic—
Those that dissever the threads of kinship, and of
patriotism, and public spirit—
These are the Moths that even the newest, as well as
the oldest, countries must beware of!
Do we suffer from Moths?

The winners of all the important matches at the
1913 meeting of the Miniature Rifle Association, shot
Remington-UMC .22 Lesmok Cartridges.
The number of experts who choose Remington-UMC
as their big match Ammunition is yearly increasing.
Perhaps it’s because they find the non-leading, non-foul-
ing qualities of these cartridges lead to higher scores.
Try a box and watch your own field or target
record improve. Look for the Remiagton-UMC

Start This Winter Right.
Last Winter how many times did you catch a cold?
How much time did you lose from business through illness?
How many nights were your children kept awake by coughing?
Shall this Winter be a repetition of last?
No! Start the Winter right.
Prepare for trouble before it troubles you.
A bottle of Hr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is a safeguard against the ills
of Winter.
In the home where it is always found coughs and colds do not intrude.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery acts as a preventive.
A dose taken before exposure to inclement weather fortifies the system.
A dose after exposure prevents the danger of a chill.
Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is the most reliable remedy to check a cold,
a cough, a chill, and all diseases and ailments caused by the cold of Winter.
Also, Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery is the most certain preventive of just
such ills, and is suitable for man, woman and child at any season and at
any place.
So start the Winter right. Don’t wait till you are sent in a hurry for a
bottle of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, but by having it ready defeat the
forces of Winter’s host of enemies to mankind before they have you in
their grip.
THE SAFEGUARD OF THE HOME.
CHRONIC BRONCHITIS.
“My husband suffered for years with Chronic Bronchitis,” writes Mrs. Eliz. Blackin, 111
Parramatta Road, Camperdown, N.S.W. “Each winter he got worse. When he coughed he
would tremble like a leaf. I leally thought he would break a blood-vessel. He would be laid
up in bed for weeks at a time. He took one or two such very bad turns that I really thought he
would die. I have sat up night after night with him, thinking he would collapse. I gave him
all kinds of cough remedies, also doctors’ prescriptions, but nothing seemed to improve him.
Fortunately, I happened to hear of Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery. I think it was the only thing
I had not tried before. I got a bottle to try, and after he had taken a few bottles of this
remedy he was completely cured, and looks so well that people hardly know him. He has never
had another bad turn since taking Dr. Sheldon’s New Discovery, and would not be without a
bottle of it for the world.”
DR, SHELDON’S NEW DISCOVERY FOR COUGHS AND COLDS is an
unequalled preparation for the treatment of all diseases of the
Throat, Bronchial Tubes and Lungs, including Influenza, Bronchitis,
Coughs, Colds, Asthma, Quinsy, Sore Throat, Hoarseness, Difficult Respira-
tion, and Pains in the Chest. When used according to directions it is a
preventive of Pneumonia and Consumption. Every bottle guaran-
teed. Price 1/6 and 3/-; Hospital size, 5/-

the year. ITS EFFECT IS ALMOST MAGICAL.
Kephadol is the doctors’ remedy. It was dis-
covered by a noted doctor—is used by doctors—
prescribed by doctors —and most enthusiastically
endorsed by doctors.
It does not affect the heart action. It can be
safely taken in large doses for exceptionally bad
cases, and it is guaranteed to be totally and wholly
harmless. It is registered under the N.S.W. Pure
Food Act, 1908, and its use does not disappoint.
Experience has taught us that, once used, no other
remedy has a chance of substituting it.

very good results. As an efficient, ant.ineuralgic it is a
thing not to be missed.”—Dr. J. Ross, M. 8., Penistone,
Yorks.
“Your Kephaldol proved very useful in cases of Neuralgia

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
lIE Lord Londonderry Lodge will never
I know me more,
I’m rubbed out from the records down
at Little Bethlehem ;
I can never be a Tyler, i ca.i never keep the
door;
Xor rise to use that fine affix “I’.W.G.M.” ;
I can never be, with ’Enley, sent to repre-
sent our King—
For the Loyal Londonderry Number Five
has turned me down.
I who to Home once dealt out stoush am now
a broken thing,
And I’ve lost my chances of the Book and
Crown.
Through the Bound Night
And the Bound fight
We had when we the brothers and the sisters
put to flight;
When the loyal “No Surrender”
Of every age and gender—
Men and girls and parsons—left the hall and
chased me through the night.
The Loyal Londonderry Lodge is great on
harmon-ee,
And we sing of love as soon as we have
cursed the Vatican ;
When the latest Romish lie’s “exposed” we
join in revelry,
And on Bound Nights sisters meet us with
a sister to each man.
And Sister Smith brings to the feast one
pound of cake or sweets,
And Sister Blenkinsop a pound of dates,
A pound of pop corn, chocolates, or ham or
cook-shop meats,
And two pounds from wife and husband, or
from mates.
At the Bound Night
You’re a bound knight
To bring a pound of something (if it’s cake
it should be light),
When the Loyal No Surrender
Number Five goes on a bender,
With some lemonade and apples they beat
anything in sight.
Me and Worthy Grand Bill Cuddy and Chief
Tyler Anketell
Had been celebrating triumphs over Rome,
All afternoon. I knew the Worthy Grand
would give me hell
If I let the Pound Night slide and stayed at
home.
But, thank goodness, I’ve a neighbor, and a
mine shift boss is he,
And I told him I had nothing for the Loyal
Number Five ;
And he sgid he’d make me up a pound of
suitability,
And two pounds as well of some alterna-tive.
For the Bound Night
Was a drowned night,
Though I started out a “No Surrender” with
my harness bright.
For the Loyal Londonderry
Failed to stay a minute merry,
And the harmony quick ended ere the joy
had reached its height.
The Loyal Londonderry Lodge by its W.G.M.
Read out the list of donors to the feast.
The Worthy Tyler took the packages and
opened them,
And the list grew shorter as the pile in-
creased.
And then he read my name, as if I were a
man of might,
And I felt myself grow taller in my shoes ;
But the Tyler read the gifts as these: “One
pound of dynamite,
One pound of powder and one pound of
fuse.”
And that Pound Night
Saw a sound fight,
For they called my gifts a Popish plot and
bruised my sore thumb quite ;
For the Tyler thrashed me sore,
And the sisters beat me more;
And the Worthy Grand, unworthy, took my
ear and pinched it tight.
The Loyal Londonderry Lodge shall never
know me more.
I’ll expunge it from the catalogue of fame.
They listened to no statement, though they
took my word before,
They beat me forth with thwackings and
with shame;
And I’m looking for that miner man —I find
his name’s McCool,
And a Romish name like Mick goes just be-
fore ;
Twas a Popish plot against the lodge unless
I am a fool,
And the “Loyal Londonderry” beat me sore.
On a Bound Night,
It doesn’t sound risrht,
For a “Loyal No Surrender” to bring pounds
of dynamite.
And of powder and of fuse ;
But that miner I’ll abuse,
And I 11 see if Nicholas McCool has a knock-
out in his right.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HURRYING out of the Feathers, urged
forward by a motive power that cen-
tred in the barman’s boot, Sam
Sharp nearly collided with Jerry Maunder.
_Lhe old man was in haste. His untidy
whiskers fluttered wildly in the breeze. But
ur>on beholding i,j s one-time partner, he came
to a sudden standstill.
Ullo, Sam, that you?” he observed un-
necessarily.
‘‘Corse it is; ’ oo 'd yer think it was—yer
great ?” said Sam crossly.
There s a bloke inside o’ there” (he jerked
his thumb in the direction of the Feathers)
“wot thinks ’e knows a lot, but I give ’im
the length o’ me tongue. If it ’adn’t a-bin
fer”
You bin drinkin’ ag'in, Samuel,” inter-
rupted Mr. Maunder reproachfully. “I kin
smell it on yer.”
“Now-, then, get a move on, you two men
blocking up the whole pavement, else I’ll
shift you quick ’n’ lively,” requested a burly
policeman, emphasising the remark by a little
shove that sent Sam into the gutter.
“Don’t take no notice—sling ’im a deaf
’un, Samuel,” urged Jerry, as Mr. Sharp
started upon a brief but libellous character
sketch of the constable’s antecedents. “ ’E’s
beneath yer contempt. Cornin’ my way?”
Sam nodded curtly. “If yer ain’t too
proud to be see’d in me comp’ny,” he said.
“Well, mate, might I arst wot you bin doin’
of since you started bisness on yer own
account?”
Mr. Maunder smiled benevolentlv. “My
bisness is doin’ food to my feller-men. Ho,
Samuel, if you was on’y to flee from the
drink and the evil-livin’, and do good to yer
pore, sufferin’ feller-men, yer ’art’d feel like
singin’ fer very joy !”
Sam regarded the altruist with marked
disfavor. “Yer nutty,” he said shortly.
“Wot’s the little swindle this time?”
Mr. Maunder gazed vacantly into space,
to the embarrassment of passing foot-pas-
sengers. “Fishers o’ Men. Pastor, the
Reverent Peter Ivopp. Meets fer Praveran’
Praise ev’ry Lord’s Day, ’leven o’clock an’
siven—Thursday evenin’s siven-tliirty. Silver
c’llection at the door,” he recited dreamily.
“Good Lord!” ejaculated Sam. “You don’t
mean to tell me yer on that lay ag’in, arter
the show-up I give you afore them Primitive
Apostle blokes, too. Fishers o’ Men indeed
—well, I’m blowed ! Silver c’llection ain’t
much of a bait neither. Wot’s your stunt in
the blessed show, Jerry? They surely don’t
never let you ’ump round the money-bag,
mate?”
“I’m a deakin, Sam,” said the Fisher,
proudly. He fumbled in his coat-pocket and
produced a crumpled, badly-printed hand-
bill. “ ’Ere, look at that.”
“Fisher —Deakin. One ’ud think yer was
the Hon’rable member for Muck!” com-
mented the caustic Sharp. “Pastor Ivopp—
oughter ’a’ been a John ’Op, I reck’n. ’Ere,
’pld ’ard, wot’s this?” he continued with
bitter incision. “Confessions of a Converted
Sinner. Sunday evenin’ nex’, at Sea o’
Galilee Chapel, seven o’clock, Deacon Maun-
der will cast a net fer pore lost souls. Come
an’ be caught.” (Why not kopped, mate?)
“Silver c’llection in aid of Chapel Fun’s. All
are ’artily welcome.’ You ain’t never got
the nerve to stand up and preach, Jerry,”
he concluded incredulously.
Mr. Maunder nodded. “On’y w’en they
wants stimulatin’ a bit, with a eye to the
silver c’llection, mate. I’ve told ’em one or
two little antidotes about your little goin’s
on, Sam—under another name, o’ corse—
wot ’as made ’em orl shudder to think ’ow
Satan ’as sech power over the sons o’ men.”
“Ho, you ’ave, ’ave you?” said Mr. Sharp,
coldly. “Like yer bloomin’ cheek. You
didn t think to tell ’em nothink about yer
own self, I s’pose?”
Mr. Maunder shook his head. “That ’ud
be the sin o’ vainglory, Samuel,” he said,
reprovingly. “But wot about yerself, mate
—’ow ’ave you bin bumpin’ along since I
larst sor yer?”
“Not too bad,” replied Mr. Sharp. “I
netted yer a fisherman, so yer’ll twig wot
I mean 20 luverley golden quids on’y yes-
terday. I’ve got ’em stowed away safe in the
same ole place, an’ ’arf of ’em ’ud ’ave bin
yers fer keeps if yer ’adn’t ’a’ made a two-
faced alligator of yer silly self.”
A nassing flutter of regret got bushed in
Mr. Maunder’s tangled whiskers.
“Glad to ’ear it, I’m sure, Samuel,” he
said, mendaciously. “You know the dear
ole tex’, don’t you : ‘The wicked shall flourish
like a —like a—green bay rum,’ or somethin’
similar. Well, this is my turnin’! To-
night’s meetin’ night. Brother Ivopp’s bin
c’llectin’ ’is rents —he owns ’ole streets o’
Rouses, Sam, fair rollin’ in boodle, he is;
’umps it about inner little brown-canvas bag
Thursdays, an’ banks it Friday mornin’s.
So as ’e'll very like be a bit be’ind’and, I’ll
’ave to open the show —meantersay, the per-
ceedin’s.”
Sam laughed rudely. “If I ’adn’t some-
thin’ very partic’lar on, I'd drop in and tell
’em a few o’ yer little experiences wot ’ud
make ’em look arter their loose silver a bit
better than wot they seems to do,” he re-
marked venomously. “ ’Ere. ’old on ’arf a
minute; I s’pose yer won’t ’ave a rinse jist
to oil yer torkin’-toobes, with a clove to
foller. No! Fust time I’ve ever know’d you
refuse a drink. Well, please yerself, on’y”
He drew Mr. Maunder into an adjacent
doorway, and spoke in low but earnest
tone to that ancient and disreputable man.
“There you are, you can take it or leave it,
mate,” he concluded.
“It was ’arves wot you said, wasn’t it,
Sam?” inquired Jerry, tentatively.
“ ’Arves. it were,” replied Sam, firmly.
“Well. I dur no as ’ow I’ll be able to per-
suade ’im.” said Mr. Maunder, doubtfullv.
“Still. T alius sees ’im ’ome arter meetin’ on
Thursday nights, so we might p’raps drop in
on yer on our way. Same ole address, I
reck’n ?”
“Number 13 Silver-street’ll find yours
truly,” said Sam. “Now. mind, none o’ yer
funny games, Jerrv. Remember, I’m crip-
pled with the roomaticism, and carn’t even
walk acrost the floor.”
“Orright, I’ll remember,” said Mr. Maun-
der. reassuringly. “Well, I must be movin’,
Sam. Then pore sinful people are waitin’
to ’ear a few comfortin’ words o’ Peace an’
Joy. S’long—see you later.”

EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY
Of Weak, Ailing Backs and Inactive Kidneys j of Irritable,
Dropsical,’ Nervous People who need Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
Have you Backache, Headache, Gravel,
Dizziness, Sleeplessness ? Are you
Bloated and Sallow ? Losing Appetite
and Weight? Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are specially for Kidney Troubles.
But the best story is not the story
in the picture, which tells of pain and
disease —it’s the story told of relief by
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.
And that’s the good thing one is
always hearing about the genuine Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills - men and women
are continually praising them.
For Doan’s Pills are an honest
medicine, because they are recom-
mended for one class of diseases only,
viz., Kidney and Bladder diseases, such
as dropsy (bloating), gravel, stone, lum-
bago, backache, rheumatism, and all
uric acid complaints.
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are sold by all
chemists and storekeepers at 2/9 per bottle, or post
free by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.

Backache and Kidney
Trouble.
TWO SYDNEY PEOPLE CURED.
Mr. W. H. Trott, 257 Victoria Road, Marrickville,
says: “Off and on for years I suffered a good deal from
backache and kidney trouble. Sometimes my back used
to ache terribly, the pain being particularly severe when
I did any stooping. At my work I have to stoop a lot,
so it was very hard on me, and handicapped me greatly.
I took several medicines, but none of them seemed to suit
my case. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were at last
recommended to me, and they proved to be the remedy I
wanted, for after taking a few doses I felt much better,
so I continued with the Pills until I had finished a
thorough course, and I am glad to say they drove the
pain out of my back, and made me feel splendid. Two
years have elapsed since then, and I am still free of
backache, but I always keep Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills by me, and take a dose or so whenever I feel a little
off color, and they never fail to do me good.”
Mrs. Arnold, “Eastfield,” 16 Gordon Street, Peter-
sham, Sydney, says: “For years I suffered terribly from
rheumatism, and was so bad that I was completely
crippled, and had to use crutches to get about. All my
joints were numbed with the constant pain, and I could
get no proper rest, day or night. I was also troubled a
lot with severe backache, and other symptoms of kidney
disorder, such as bad headaches and irregular secretions.
No one knows what I went through, but my suffering is
now a thing of the past, thanks to Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills. After trying all sorts of kidney medicines
without deriving any benefit, I got this grand remedy,
and twelve bottles completely and permanently cured me.
Relief came after taking a couple of bottles, and as I
continued with them the improvement w r as maintained,
until finally I was cured. I can now get about without
crutches or assistance, and feel a different woman. My
cure has been well tested, for quite twelve years have
elapsed since it was effected, and I am still well.

grab at his companion’s sleeve. “You are
quite positive that, your poor, afflicted friend
cannot walk? You are quite certain that it’s
£2O he’s come by not quite honest, so that
it would be a solemn lesson and a spiritual
warning to him if we were to take it and —
ahem! —restore it to its rightful owner?”
“Don’t you worry yerself,” said Mr.
Maunder, soothingly. “He carn’t move ’and
or foot from ’is chair. Why, ’e carn’t dress
’iself, ’is landlady—good-’earted sort of a
body, Mrs. Widger, by name, ’as even to
put on ’is”
“Brother Maunder,” said the Rev. Mr.
Ivopp, severely, “you are surely not going
to forget yourself?”
“That’s eggsackly wot Mrs. Widger arst
Sam, on’y t’other day,” began Mr. Maunder
with a senile grin, but Pastor Ivopp quelled
him with an impressive glance.
“Lead on, Brother,” he requested. “The
sooner we get this business over, the better.
If it had not been for the fact that I am
sincerely desirous of righting a wrong, I
would never have moved in the matter.
Dear me, these stairs are very dark and
treacherous,” he added, as he and
would have fallen but for a saving clutch
of Mr. Maunder’s large red hand.
Sam was seated in a rickety chair at a
still more dilapidated deal table, when, in
answer to his gruff invitation to “Come in.
and be quick about it!” Mr. Ivopp and his
escort entered the room.
“Evenin’, Samuel,” said Mr. Maunder,
genially. “I’ve brought this ’ere reverent
gen’leman into see if ’e carn’t tork yer inter
a betterer frame o’ mind than wot you was
in larct time I sor yer. ’ls efforts ’as bin
wunnerful blest, ain’t they, Brother Ivopp?”
Mr. Ivopp regarded Mr. Sharp with a
tender smile. “Far be it from me to sound
the loud ’arp, dulcimer, psaltery, sackbut
and all the other kinds of musical instru-
ments in my own praise, Brother Maunder,”
he responded. “But I will say this much,
I’ve met the Devil in all manner of cunning
disguises, and never once have I failed to
recognise him by his cloven hoof.”
“Well, you needn’t look at me if you ’ave,”
retorted the indignant Sam. “I ain’t the
Devil—this ’ere’s a boot, not a ’oof. And
if you carn’t keep a civil tongue in yer ’ead,
you can just vamose, nuick ’n’ lively—l ain’t
pertic’lar anxious fer yer comp’ny.”
“I don’t know so much about that, my
dear friend,” said Mr. Kopp, unctuously.
“Satan’s inside of you at this very moment,
though you may not realise it, urging you
to take no ’eed of my words of peace and
lovin’ kindness —tormenting you, too, with
whips and stinging scorpions.”
“Well, if roomaticism ain’t the very devil,
whips an’ stingin’ scorpions an’ orl, I dunno
wot is, so p’raps yer right, bosSj” said Sam
with a sour grin.
“This blessed man,” continued Mr. Ivopr>.
smiling beafifically and laying a flabby hand
upon Jerry’s arm. “This blessed man told
me about yon, my poor, afflicted brother.
Well do I remember his soul-stirring words
-—he was courting one of our fairest and
most precious daughters in the Lord at the
time, Liza Higgs”
“That’s off,” interrupted the blessed Mr.
Maunder, curtly. “Besides, she ain’t your
daughter-in-law, not so fer as I knows of.”
Mr. Kopp shook a fat finger reprovingly.
“Ah, only a little amorous fluttering—a
little what our vivacious French brothers
would call ‘a fair du cur ,’ ” he remarked
with playful tolerance.
“Jerry alius was a hit of a dorg among
the gals, wasn’t you, Jerry?—you satyr-face
baboon,” put in the acidulous Sam.
Mr. Maunder’s demeanor here became
so threatening that Mr. Kopp made haste
to turn the conversation.
“My poor suffering brother,” he said,
addressing himself to Sam. “Brother
Maunder tells me that your goings out and
your comings in have been singularly blest
of late.”
“Jerry’s a addle-’eaded ole rattle-snake,”
responded Mr. Sharp unkindly. “But I’m
not ashamed to own as I ’ave ’ad a run o’
luck larst day or two.” He drew a dirty
canvas bag from his breast-pocket and flung
it jingling on the table in front of him.
“Twenty of the best,” he announced, a shade
truculently.
Mr. Kopp beamed benevolently, and,
fumbling in his coat-tails, produced an
almost identical little bag. It looked like a
confidence trick.
“I own a trifling property,” he begpn.
“Oli, a very, very trifle, I know, but such as
it is it represents the carefulness of many
lean years. This little bag contains my
weekly rents. .Tabez Saunders askes nie to
call again, by the way ; that makes the third
time. But, oh, we' must have patience;
Jabez Saunders is my cross, but I bear him
gladly. In addition, I jiave here the ’umble
offerings of the faithful —the widow’s mite,
my friend, but none the less acceptable foy
that. How much floes the widow’s mite
amount to this week, Brother Maunder?”
“One an’ ’leven ’a’penny in coppers an’
two conversation lollies,” replied Jerry.
“One and eleven pence halfpenny,” re-
peated Mr. Kopp enthusiastically. “Never
mind the lollies, brother. That makes my
little total exactly twenty pounds one shil-
ling and a halfpenny.” He leant his elbows
squarely on the table and smiled into Mr.
Sharp’s face.
“’Old on, guv’nor,” said the latter in some
alarm, “you very near capsized the lamp
that time.”
“Indeed, brother, extremely careless of
me, I’m sure,” murmured Mr. Kopp, looking
rather crest-fallen. “Twenty pounds. I
know of a safe little investment, my dear
friend, by which”
Here Mr. Maunder, who had been leaning
half out of the open window, interrupted the
L “Sam, there’s Joe Mannin’, the ’tec, corn-
in’ up the street. ’E’s lookin’ at the num-
bers of the ’ouses. ’E’s stoppin’ right oppo-
site.”
“Will yer keep ver elber away.from the
lamp, fer the second time o’ arstin, you—
you copper-nosed Kopp!” growled Mr.
Sharp, ferociously. “D’yer think I want the
place burnt about me ears? Joe Mannin,
did yer say, Jerry? Whew ! Joe’s ’ad it in
fer me this long while. Keep yer eye on
’im, mate. There, that’s better —no use in
advertisin’ I’m at ’ome.” He suddenly blew
out the lamp, and at the same instant
clutched Mr. Ivopp’s predatory right hand
in a firm, vice-like grip,
“Leggo my wrist, sir! What do you
mean by such outrageous conduct? This is
tantamount to an assault. Brother Maunder,
I call upon you to witness that I am being
assaulted.”
“Jerry carn’t witness nothink —there
ain’t light enuff,” explained Sam. “Be-
sides, I ain’t assaultin’ yer, boss. It’s on’y
that I’m nervous of the dark —I alius was
from a nipper. I feels safer ’oldin’ some-
body’s kind, strong ’and in mine. Wot’s
Joe Mannin’ doin’ of now, Jerry?”
Mr. Maunder’s muffled voice sounded from
the near neighborhood of the door.
“I’m jest a-goin’ to see—l’m a-goin’ to
shadder ’im like a slut-’ound, Sam. I’ll be
back in ’arf a mo’.” *'
“Slut-’ound; be d —d! Youll be doin’
somethin’ fat-’eaded if you ain’t careful,”
prophesied Mr. Sharp. “If ’e twigs you ’e’ll
guess I ain’t fej off. Best stay where you
are, mate.”
Mr. Maunder made no reply ; instead, the
door closed softly on his retreating form.
For a moment there was a silence only
broken by Mr. Kopp’s stertorous, indignant
breathing. Then Sam said in a, strangely
strangled tone, “I’ve a sort o’ notion ole
Jerry’s bamboozled us, guv’nor. I don’t
believe Joe Mannin’s within a mile o’ Silver-
street.’'’
He released his captive’s wrist and struck
a match ; his hqnd shook so that he found
some difficulty in Relighting the lamp.
“There, didn’t I tel} yer so?” he cried with
a note of despairing triumph. “Jerry’s
cleared with the boodle —the dirty thief!
Unless” (here he swung round on Mr. Kopp
with an alarming display of truculence),
“unless you pinched it.”
“Me!” screamed Mr. Kopp, in a voice
shrill with righteous wrath. “Me 1 I
haven’t touched the bags—how could I with
you hanging on to my hand like a —like a
polypus—you blood-sucking leech, you ! They
were both on the table when you doused the
glim—should have said blew out the light.”
“I know they was,” said Sam with
asperity. “But the question is where are
they now? Ho, I begin to tumble to yer art-
ful little game, mate. Wot did you want to
go monkeyin’ with the lamp fer, might I.
kindly arsk?”
“I never touched the lamp, or the money
either,” exclaimed the fuming Mr. Kopp.
“Brother Maunder must have yielded to a
sudden temptation of the Evil One. I’d
never have thought it of him. A deacon,
too! Oh, he shall repent of this night’s
work, in sackcloth and in ashes ! He shall
be smitten hip and thigh, even as Gideon
smote the”
The door opened slowly, and Mr. Maunder
appeared upon the threshold.
“It’s orriglit, Sam,” he observed reassur-
ingly. “Yer safe fer this once, I see’d Joe
turn inter Emerald Row. ’Ullo! why, wot’s
the joke?”
“The joke, you ’errin’-faced ’addock!”
bawled the incensed Mr. Sharp. “Wot you
done with them two canvas backs —bags, I
mean, wot was layin’ on the table w’en you
trumped up a cock-an’-bull yarn about Joe
Maimin’? S’welp me, if you don’t ’and ’em
over this minute I’ll ’ave yer life !”
Mr. Maunder laughed raucously. “Yer
got beetles in yer arcade, Sam,” he remarked
enigmatically. “I ain’t bin near the table.
Feel in yer own pockets, mate.”
“Oh, let us earnestly petition a guid-
ing light, brothers,” quavered Mr. Kopp.
“Don’t you start none o’ yer petitionin’
’ere, an’ don’t you call me ‘brother’ agin,
’cos I won’t ’ave it —d’y’ ’ear me?” hissed
the infuriated Mr. Sharp. “You go on out
o’ this, quick ’n’ lively. Take ’im away,
you Jerry Maunder, afore I ’ave ’is ’art’s
blood on me ’ands.”
“Tork sense, Sam; you ain’t pla^ctin' l

Mr. Maunder with some spirit “oome along;

lie. waited until Jerry had quitted the
apartment, the protesting Pastor Kopp on
his arm, before putting his head down upon
the table and giving a free yent to his over-
powering emotion.
He. was still busy wiping the tears from,
his eyes when Mr. Maunder returned.
“Ho. you pome back, ’ave you.” faltered
Sam. “Wot you done with ole Blow ’ant?”
He broke down afresh.
“’ls langwidge to me was secfo as a saint
couldn’t put-up with —no, nor a deakin for-
give,” replied the aggrieved Mr. Maunder,
“I’m very much afraid, Sam, as *ow our be-
loved and reverent brother ’as fell from
grace.”
“•’E can fall through the window fer all I
care,” said Mr. Sharp concisely. “We’ve
fell ip a bit, too, Jerry. ’Arves was wot I
said, wasn’t it? Well, you can stick to the
lot. You don’t deserve it, considerin’ you
was runnin’ with the ’are an’ ’untiif with

I won’t go back on me word. ’Eve’s ’is little
bag—-one an’ eleven pence ’a’penny in cop-
pers. Well, mine ’adn’t got much more in
it. The old ’un diddled us over the rents.

tail, playin’ at the roomatics! No more o’
yer Fishers o’ Men fer me, Jerry; I’m full
up of the ’ole bad-’arted, designin’ crowd.”
“Same ’ere,” said Mr. Maunder tersely.
He sat down heavily on Sam’s bed, and
diving into his trousers pocket, produced a
dirty canvas bag. He emptied the contents
upon the ragged, patchwork quilt. “Two’s
inter seventeen-ten is five an’ carry ought
an’ eight an’ carry ought an’ add ten shillin’
—eight p’und fifteen apiece, Sam. I yanked
it outer ’is coat-tail Docket w’en you an’

“Well, I’m d d! If that don’t lick

CONCERNING A COMMON COMPLAINT.
Of all common ailments perhaps Constipation is the one most fruitful of
ill-health and a potent cause of disease in a variety of forms. Too fre-
quently neglected (especially by women) it may result in grave conse-
quences, and all who suffer from it in any degree should set about
establishing a permanent cure without delay. Failure of the bowels to
act properly results in poisonous accumulations, impure blood, sluggish
liver, and i great number of disorders such as headaches, nervous debility,
anaemia, loss of energy, and even diseases of a chronic and dangerous
nature. If you are troubled with this really serious complaint do not
regard it as a light matter, and remember that the cure may be surely
and speedily effected by means of

Every
Engineer
Knows
That to run a Steam Plant Economically
you must have Dry Steam. The only
efficient method to adopt to ensure your
steam being free from water is to lead
the water with the steam to a proper
collector, and discharge it through a
Steam Trap. But you must have a Trap
that is Reliable and does not Leak.
THE “SENTINEL”
High Pressure STEAM TRAP
Is Tested to 2501 b. Pressure, and is guaranteed
to remain tight even after much use.
