The Red Page
What Do the Blind Read?
I saw a man sitting on the wharf at
Manly the other day. He was on a camp-
stool and had a little tin box in' front of
him. On the box there was the one word,
BLIND. I asked him if he ever read, and.
he laughed and said, “I am blind.” I said,
“Chn you not read Braille?” And he
shook his head. “Nor Moon type?” “No.”
He was a sightless illiterate.
The National Institute for the Blind is
the largest publishing-house for sightless
readers in the world; and it is probably the
only publishing-house in the world that
sells its books at a loss. Between 1915 and
1926 it sent out more than 2,515,000
publications, made a reduction of two-
thirds on the cost price of every volume
sold to blind residents in the British
Empire, and sold to the blind residents of
other countries at bare cost price.
In the printing-room of the National
Institute all the stereotyping machines are
manipulated by blind men and women.
The book is read by a sighted reader to
the blind stereotyper, who transcribes the
reading matter in embossed Braille charac-
ters on to a folded-metal shdet. The
machine is operated by the feet. When
the whole plate has been covered with
Braille characters it is handed to a blind
proofreader, who ascertains whether any
mistakes have occurred. The printing
press is worked by a sighted operator, but
the embossed pages are passed to blind
workers for collating and folding. In the
binding department blind operators insert
small guards between each section in order
to prevent damage from crushing, and after
sewing and binding the name of the
volume and its author is attached in
Braille to the side of the book so that the
blind reader may easily select a required
volume. One full-sized volume in Braille
costs, approximately, Bs. to produce, and as
an ordinary-sized volume in inkprint fills
four or five volumes in Braille, this makes
the total cost of producing one work about
£2.
Since Braille died (in 1834) the print-
ing by which his name is known throughout
the world has been gradually improved.
The alphabet consists of varying combina-
tions of six dots, arranged in their primary
order like the six dots of a domino. There
are 63 possible combinations of these dots,
and after the letters of the alphabet have
been supplied the remaining signs are used
for punctuations, contractions, etc. Con-
tractions are specially important in the
Braille system, for the great drawback to
Braille is its bulk. The characters are
embossed on special paper, so that they can
be distinguished by touch. A Braille book
cannot last the same time as an ordinary
book, but, if properly handled, it has a
lifetime of many years. A thorough know-
ledge of Braille can be acquired in a few
Weeks’ study, but proficiency in reading
comes only after a minimum period of six
months’ practice. Moon type is a simple
embossed variation of the ordinary Roman
alphabet, and it is found to be best suited
to those who lose their sight in late life.
The selection of books to be transliterated
into Braille or Moon type is by no means
an easy task. With the entire literary pro-
duction of the world to select from, the
judges are naturally overwhelmed by the
magnitude of the task. However, the
selection committee of the N. 1.8. decided
to be guided, firstly, by personal taste;
secondly, by the taste of leading critics;
lastly, by vox populi. Production being so
costly, it is unlikely that it will ever equal
in extent even one per cent, of ink-printed
books. Selection, therefore, has to be made
by somebody, and in the Publications Com-
mittee of the N. 1.8. (some of its members
are sightless) the blind people of all the
world have guidance that must be of in-
estimable benefit to their reading.
A good idea of the varied character of
the books selected by the committee can
be obtained from the following descriptive
list lately published:
“The Ebb Tide,” “Typee” and “Moby Dick” cater
for adventurous minds imprisoned in bodies that
cannot wander far. Lord Grey’s “Memoirs,” Ward
Price’s account of the world tour of the Prince of
Wales, and Lowell’s “With Lawrence in Arabia” are.
amongst a subsidiary list of books on subjects of
the day. Literary criticism is represented by Quiller
Couch’s “Studies of Charles Dickens and Other
Eminent Victorians” ; fantasy by George Macdonald’s
“The Princess and the Goblin”; drama by Con-
greve’s “The Way of the World” ; and economics by
Carman's “Wealth.” The classics include “Selected
Plutarch’s Lives,” “Selected Voyages of Hakluyt,”
“Dialogues of Plato” and “Utopia.” Poetry includes
“Paradise Lost,” selected poems of Rupert Brooke,
“Epithalamium,” “Goblin Market,” as well as poems
by Freeman, Bridges, Thomas, Lang, Gosse, Alice
Meynell, Marvell and De la Mare. There are works
also on subjects of technical education, Braille in-
structional books, handbooks for teachers and books
in graded Braille, etc.
And it is interesting to note that in the
case of every book transliterated into
Braille by the Institute since the inaugura-
tion of its publishing department, the author
and the publisher have granted permission
to reproduce entirely free of royalty.
The Institute also publishes ten periodi-
cals in Braille and Moon, including two
newspapers.
Perhaps the most remarkable part of the
Institute’s activities is the help that is given
to blind students training for examinations,
and to blind members of the professions
who wish to progress in their work. The
Students’ Library had its origin in the war
period, when many educated men lost their
sight and had to be re-educated for new
careers. Textbooks on all subjects were
necessary, and the Institute was asked to
undertake their translation into* Braille.
The Institute’s manuscript department,
then a small band of voluntary workers,
was confronted -with the task of evolving
special codes for the transliteration of
books in Old English, Middle English,
Gothic, West Saxon, mediaeval Latin and
French. It was through the efforts of this
untiring band of devoted men and women
that a method has been standardised by
which almost any tabular work, and even
diagrams, can be represented satisfactorily
in Braille. To transliterate “Beowulf” a,nd
the “Anglo-Saxon Chronicle” into Braille
is no light task, but such feats are now
accomplished.
“The Annual Report of the National
Institute for the Blind” (London) is a
record of what progressive effort can
achieve. Blindness is no longer synony-
mous with mendicancy, nor with a condition
of stationary oblivion. The world of the
blind is one °f latent possibilities; possi-
bilities towards which the blind themselves,
with all the help that the Institute can
give them, will be the first to find the
wav.
GERALD DILLON.
The Theatre in Europe To-day.
This year will be considered significant
in the history of the drama. Ih June an
international theatre festival was arranged
in Paris, of all places. One says “of all
places” advisedly, for Paris, itself regarded
as a Mecca by vast numbers of pilgrims of
the arts, does., not commonly welcome or
even pay much attention to the art of
other nations. This has been especially
so in the theatre.
However, Firmin Gemier, director of the
Odeon Theatre, a man of great energy and
alert mind, is doing his. best to change all
that. His enthusiasm was kindled by Rein-
hardt’s innovations of some 15 or 20 years
ago, such as the apron stage and devices
for bringing the audience into personal con-
tact with the actors. These ideas M. Gemier
has used to startle Paris in his own more
recent productions. Now, in spite of the
croakings of those who said it would be
impossible to arrange a representative in-
ternational festival, and that anyhow it
would be a failure with audiences, he has
carried it through to a triumphant con-
clusion.
Of course there were the inevitable diffi-
culties and disappointments of a first
attempt. Reinhardt at the last moment was
unable to bring a company, and, as some-
body observed, an international theatre
festival without Reinhardt is rather like
“Hamlet” without the Prince. Still, there
were companies from Holland, Belgium,
Denmark, Italy, Spain, Austria and even
Japan, all of them giving in their own
language plays of national dramatists. Eng-
land was represented by Sybil Thorndike
and Lewis Ca'sson and company in “Saint
Joan” and “Medea.” The Saint Joan of
our foremost tragic actress was a perform-
ance of high interest to Paris, because it
could be compared with the rendering of
the part given in French about two years
ago by the charming little Russian, Mme.
Pitoeff.
Besides the performances at the two
Champs-Elysees theatres, there was an
international congress of representatives of
all theatrical crafts. Naturally discussions
were mainly a preliminary clearing of the
ground. But such international questions
as translation rights and the facilities for
obtaining accredited translations of foreign
works were partially dealt with.
Among English critics it has been cus-
tomary for some time to mourn over the
state of the theatre, particularly in London.
Unhappily there has been ample cause.
The star system, especially in its actor-
manager phase, before the war had been
diagnosed as one root of the trouble. After
the war there occurred the notorious gam-
bling in West End theatre rents, with the
consequence that usually the latest lessee,
even supposing he had artistic ideals, was
obliged to play for safety and look out for
box-office successes in order to avoid bank-
ruptcy. But most disastrous of all was
war re-action. It was natural, no doubt,
for the majority of men on leave and their
friends to seek only the lightest, flimsiest
entertainment. What they needed was
brightness and gaiety. All the same, that
they continued during the post-war years
to regard the theatre merely as an anodyne
put back its normal artistic development
considerably.
But there are indications of recovered
and indeed increased vitality. In England
the provinces have shown the capital the
way of salvation, which is to pursue a con-
sistent artistic policy. For it was in Man-
chester, at the Gaiety Theatre, that Miss
Horniman kept her flag splendidly flying
for so many years. English drama has a
large debt to her. In Birmingham just
before the war Barry Jackson built his
Repertory Theatre, which is now his per-
manent base. From it he takes companies
to London for long seasons at the Court
and the Kingsway. At Norwich Nugent

Monck has established his extraordinarily
interesting co-operative theatre. There are
also repertory’ theatres at Liverpool, Glas-
gow and other centres to put beside Lon-
don’s solitary, though beloved, Old Vic.
All this vigor has influenced the metro-
polis, which did not give sufficient support
to the efforts of Granville Barker and
others previously 7. Small theatres in the
further suburbs have found it possible to
achieve popular along with artistic success.
Notably Nigel Playfair’s direction of the
Lyric at Hammersmith will long be remem-
bered for a succession of exquisite revivals
of eighteenth-century modes. The British
Drama League also, founded seven years
ago, is fostering an interest in all forms of
theatre art.
Yet congratulations upon such signs of a
dramatic revival may easily be premature.
Last month there returned from a theatre
exhibition at Magdeburg W. A. Darlington
of the London Daily Telegraph. This
critic is scarcely to be suspected of bees in
the bonnet, still less of bats in the belfry,
as the saying goes. His own play, “Alf’s
Button,” has had a success which any- com-
mercial management must respect. His
critiques are agreeable reading and show
sound practicality. He is no fantastic
idealist. So that when he defines his state
of mind at the end of his visit as “a mix-
ture of aesthetic exhilaration and patriotic
depression,” his comments merit grave
attention. According to him the production
and scenic side of the theatre everywhere in
Germany is far.ahead of what is being done
in England, where it is still the closely
realistic reproduction of some familiar scene
that wins a round of applause.
The truth is that most of our people do
not distinguish between what John Drink-
water, in his recent book the “Gentle Art
of Theatre-going,” calls “the theatre of the
imagination” and “the theatre which is
onlv a diversion.” They do not seem to
realise that entertainment and imagination
can be combined. What they want is diver-
sion purely. Even men of intellectual
standing will admit without a blush that
they demand nothing of the theatre above
the level of the fiction read on railway
journeys.
This sounds gloomy. Over against it one
must set the artistic failures and financial
difficulties reported by 7 a German corres-
pondent from Berlin. Still there is no
doubt that on the Continent the theatre
takes a high place in civilisation. In
Sweden, for instance, where theatres play
to full houses, light entertainment does not
attract the nublic; serious drama is de-
manded. Hungary, in spite of bad times,
has just increased its theatre subsidy.
It is clear that Australia in this matter
of the theatre has much to learn and has,
it is to be hoped, much farther to go.
Surely the eternally-same musical comedy,
the improbable “crook” drama (though this
admittedly does sometimes offer great act-
ing opportunities) and the lewd American
farce are not our permanent mark? Yet
the accident of a play like “Outward
Bound” and the enterprise of a Boucicault
are what we have to depend upon to vary
the routine. The plea of youthful nation-
hood does not avail us. Within the bare
50 years since Bulgaria won her freedom
from the Turk a national theatre has been
built and subsidised and is now “the
leading factor in Bulgarian intellectual life.”
Pending the establishment or subsidising of
such a theatre in Australia it is for play-
goers to convince the theatrical combines
that there is money also (not big money,
no doubt; but gained with a far less lavish
outlay) in the theatre of the imagination.
BEATRICE TILUKSLEY.
“The Bulletin” Prize Novel
When Aylwin, newly home from the Cru-
sades, told of the progressiveness and high
cultural standards of the Saracens, the
assembled villagers nearly burst their jer-
kins with incredulous laughter.
English mentality has not much changed
since then, except that now the laughter
would not be hearty enough to endanger
any clothes, but would be slightly bored.
News about the advanced civilisation of
Australia and Maoriland would get greet-
ings in Europe, U'.S.A. and England varying
with the intensity of the provincialism or
density of the reader, but based on the
one common root of incredulity. I suggest
therefore, that the entrants for The Bul-
letin prize novel should dedicate them-
selves to the task of writing a book to
shatter, explode or at any rate disturb
this mass of serene ignorance.
Three kinds of novels should be barred.
Firstly, the writer who deals with the great
wide open empty spaces of Westralia,
Northern Territory or Burwood should be
punished frightfully, preferably by con-
demning him to live the life of a N.S.W.
factory-owner for not less than one year.
Next, any novel treating of convict life
should not be allowed to antedate in period
the new wing at Long Bay or the improve-
ments to Pentridge. And, lastly, no gold-
digging yarn should be placed further back
in history than the prospecting and research
work carried out so competently by the
Sydnej’’ Municipal Council. The panorama
of present-day life in these two countries
is so gorgeous, so complex and multi-
colored, so entertaining and so different,
that any novel purposelessly poking about
in the past should be scratched before the
weights appear.
Indeed, it is hopeless to ask a writer to
cover more than a segment of the wide
cultural prospect w’hich would have to take
in the Northern Rivers cocky and the Pitt-
street indent-agent who supplies him with
a wireless set, the A.J.C. Derby and the
goat races at Charleville, the social doings
at the sugar-works at Innisfail and the
Winter Garden at the Hotel Australia, the
wreckage of the English accent wrought by
sun-bred languor and the slight sniffiness
about Australia engendered thereby in
Maoriland (the latter place being inhabited
by a race of improved Scotchmen who prize
the English tongue), the endless stream of
steamers filing up Sydney harbor with im-
ported goods and the vast establishment
of Mr. Macßobertson, a kangaroo hunt and
the wharfies’ stop-work meeting game of
two-up, a farewell Melba concert at the
Melbourne Town Hall and the school prize-
giving at Tumut School of Arts, the Sydney
Bridge and the ferry over Breakfast Creek,
the tin hares at Epping and the crocodiles
m the Fitzroy, Hannan-street in Kalgoorlie
and the Block in Melbourne, the ponies,
the All Blacks, Norman Lindsay, the Bogey
Hole at Bondi, Canberra, City Tattersall’s
Club, the platypus and Mr. Lang.
It ought to be possible, all the same, for
a writer to tell a story about a man and
a woman, or two men and a woman and
a horse, and put it in a setting which will
show what new things have come to flower
when folks moved down to these parts
from England and elsewhere. It ought to
show the falseness of that quaint and obsti-
nate theory held in the old lands that be-
cause countries are new and young the
people in them are new and young. We are
five weeks younger, that is all, which is
precisely the time it takes the steamer to
bring the books, frocks, hats, magazines,
ties, paintings, trousers, jazz numbers and
any irrational craze that represents the
dernier cri anywhere. In point of fact such
is the wide incidence of the travelling
habits of the folk in these countries that
Bathurst, Auckland and Double Bay are
in closer contact with London than Shrop-
shire is.
I am going to write a Maoriland novel
myself in which I am not going to mention
a sheep or a cow, and which will stress the
fact that M.L. has more Oxford and Cam-
bridge men to the thousand than any Eng-
lish county, and that, relatively, far more
bright young people are discussing the Sit-
wells and Rimbaud. This may account for
the fact that the place has produced so
many more B.A.’s than creative writers.
If any writer wins the prize with a book
conveying the impression ‘that both coun-
tries are inhabited by sun-tanned illiterate
joyous hard riders, I propose to put the
matter before a Royal Commission as be-
ing the most expensive and useless way of
not settling it.

Our Musical Prowess
Melbourne’s musical taste is being called
in question. Grand opera, excellently done,
has just been staged there before half-
empty houses. A committee is calling for
a million shillings to help establish a per-
manent orchestra, and calling in vain, as
voices crying in the wilderness. Now dis-
quieted citizens are voicing their suspicions
in the daily press, asking “What is wrong
with musical Melbourne?” “Under the
frightful curse of the rowdy percussions
that pass for music in the U.S.A.” is the
fierce plaint of one. “We seem able to
recognise good work only when it is gilded
with Mammon,” laments another. A third
marvels at the absence of Conservatorium
and other pupils from the operas.
Travelled Australians never entertained
any delusions about Melbourne’s musical
taste, recognising the newspaper decision
that we are highly musical persons as so
much hot air—hot air, nevertheless, that
ridicules us in the eyes of visitors. Actu-
ally, Bill the Bushman is in the Stone Age
in matters tnusical compared with Luigi,
Franz and Ignace.
In the first place, he is not a singer. Song
comes naturally to most Europeans. Even
the most illiterate peasantry has the faculty
of combining in vocal music, from folk
songs to operatic excerpts, some of them in
four, five and even six parts. As an Aus-
tralian serving with the Imperial forces
during the war I was struck with the
Tommy’s love of singing, and often con-
trasted it with the silence of our own men.
I was told that special training and en-
couragement were given to our recruits to
get them to sing at all.
Our highbrow musical concerts are always
a frost unless the artist is of sufficient
repute to attract the moneyed crowd which
accepts such functions as a social obligation.
To our average man good music is merely
a bewildering string of notes. At the guest-
house I stayed at last summer (120 guests),
you could create a cuckoo-clock effect by
playing alternately a Beethoven roll and a
jazz roll. They came in with the jazz and
went out with the Moonlight Sonata.
Three Australian pianos out of four are
out of tune. What is more to the point,
their owners are generally blissfully un-
aware of the fact. How many of us have
had to listen while they bang their rheu-
matic instruments, tearing out of them
cacophonies that make you want to shriek
aloud with pain—and have been looked to
expectantly for applause at the finish!
Furthermore, the works of the masters
are not displayed in the windows of our
music shops. Jazz and the saxophone
appear there in all their glory. If you
wanted to buy either of these articles in
fashionable European shops you would
draw the assistant aside and whisper to
him your shame. Even then you would
feel like the man who tried to buy chewing-
gum in the Savoy Hotel.
Think, also, of the average Australian
cinema orchestra, with its steam-driven
pianist; its cornetist always a note behind
and determined, independent fellow, not to
catch up; its flautist twiddling and tweed-
ling like a sparrow gone crazy; its fiddler
striking his instrument with savage blows
that draw blood—the listener’s blood—at
every stroke. And think of the seductive
strains the itinerant fiddler of Italy, cadg-
ing for pennies, can draw from his smooth-
worn, well-loved instrument; or how in
that romantic land even the accordion can
be made to render harmonies that fire the
blood.
I have no doubt, though, that the news-
papers will continue to thrust musical
greatness upon us until we develop the
habit of self criticism—if we ever do.

Choral Music
Whilst quite agreeing with Dr. Barry’s
plaint about the dearth of enthusiasm for
choral music in Sydney (R.P. 20/10/’27),
I protest that he rather unfairly ignores the
activities of. the oldest of our choral socie-
ties in his tilt at the banalities which are
“put across” by choirs of lesser calibre. I
refer to the Royal Philharmonic Society;
founded in the ’eighties, it has kept its flag
flying bravely in the face of this waning
interest which is so much to be deplored.
Consider the list of works performed dur-
ing the last four years, excluding those of
the “Messiah,” which, even if so “tortured,”
yet unfailingly draws large audiences to
the Town Hall:—
1924: Haydn’s “Creation”; Elgar’s “Caractacus”;
Elgar’s “Apostles.”
1925: Verdi’s “Requiem”; Coleridge-Taylor’s
“Hiawatha” ; Wagner’s
1926: Berlioz’s “Faust”; Verdi’s “Aida”; Sulli-
van’s “Golden Legend.”
1927: Saint-Saens’s “Samson and Delilah” ; Beet-
hoven’s “Mass in D” ; Gounod’s “Faust” (with
Joseph Hislop).
Of the four operatic works which critics
may say are outside the legitimate scope
of a choral society, two —“Aida” and “Sam-
son and Delilah”—command royalties, and
the music has to be specially imported, so
these two are under no suspicion of being
hackneyed. Gounod’s “Faust” was per-
formed only for the purpose of giving an
effective background to the singing of one
of the world’s greatest exponents of a very
great part. For the rest, operas have a
good drawing power, and I say quite
frankly that the “loaves and fishes,” in these
days of stupendous production costs, have
to be considered. Berlioz’s “Faust” is
essentially a concert work. Two of the
others stand out as being of supreme im-
portance. These are Elgar’s “Apostles”
(first Sydney performance) and Beethoven’s
Mass.
The Phil, has its faults, the greatest be-
ing a want of balance caused by that very
lack of interest that Dr. Barry laments.
Male choristers are in about one-third the
strength that they ought to be. But on
the question of repertoire there can be no
reproach.
I would suggest that we shall not arrive
at a happier condition of affairs by in-
cluding in one sweeping condemnation
a society which has so gallantly and
for so long endeavored to present what may
fairly be called the best of choral works
to a more or less apathetic public.

A Satchel of Books
The House of Fear, by Robert W. Ser-
vice (Fisher Unwin). A blood-stained piece
of fiction with hypnotism as its motive
power.
Treasure Island, by Robert Louis Steven-
son (Benn). The colored illustrations by
Edmund Du lac alone make it worth a place
in any booklover’s collection.
Rovers and Stay-at-homes, by Maribel
Edwin (Dent). A successor to the author’s
“Brian and the Wood-folk” nature stories
for children. Gives an intimate home touch
to the lives of the birds and animals
described, and is cleverly illustrated.
Declaration of Love, by Geoffrey Dennis
(Heinemann). Four egotistical letters in
which a morbidly-minded young man ana-
lyses liis love contents and his spiritual
innards. The cleverness with which they are
written is equalled by the sickliness of their
motive.
Her Closed Hands, by Putnam Weale
(Macmillan). A good yarn set against a
Chinese background. Mr. Weale has written
much serious literature about “the East,”
and his novel is so up to date that portion of
its action lies in the days of the present
revolution.
The Veil of Islam, by L. Noel (Stanley
Paul). The author of “The Caid” and the
“Riff Bride,” having found grains of gold
in the sands of the desert, goes once more
prospecting in that highly-colored land, where
picturesque Moors, Arab steeds and passion-
ate lovers make up the literary trifle. Good
of its sort.
Aristophanes, by Arthur S. Way (Mac-
millan). Dr. Way’s translations of Greek
classics into English verse have won for him
a high reputation both as scholar and poet.
The wit and satire of Aristophanes was not
distinguished by refinement, but the trans-
lator has succeeded in “carrying it across”
without bowdlerising it out of recognition,
and has at the same time given full effect
to its mordant quality.

George-street, Sydney.
Grim utilitarian,
George-street lacks a proper plan,
Happening, it seems, by chance;
But its making was Romance !
With his bullock-waggon lone
Straight into a world unknown
Bill, the bullock-driver, went,
Capturing a continent!
Man, upon his endless quest,
Sought the Unknown, sought the West,
Where the dying sunset shone —
“Might as well be gittin' on !“
So he pioneered the track,
Winding out to Further Back,
Pushing slowly out and out
Through a wilderness of Doubt.
Here a rock and there a stump ;
Down the hillside with a bump.
“Turn off here to dodge that log!
Blimey ! Whoa, there ! Gripes, a bog !”
When one night his bullocks strayed,
There a big detour he made;
Now no bullock team could mend
In the city that big bend.
Where he camped to dodge the showers,
Now a tall cathedral towers ;
Where his bullocks made a swerve,
Still remains an awkward curve.
Now on tracks he used to go
Fifty thousand people flow
Round and round about to-day,
Following his vanished dray.
As he by his bullocks strode
Bill town-planned the first real road.
Ghostly oaths re-echo still —
Out and further out goes Bill

Prey.
There’s a hawk upon the wing above the
farm,
And the gulls are flying low above the sea,
And the chickens ru'n for shelter in alarm,
But the Ashes in the spray are sporting
free;
For the summer sun is kindly,
And it scatters favors blindly ;
And there’s fish and fowl for them and yon
and me.
There are worms and flies and bees in bush
and soil;
There are eagles, foxes, hunters other-
where ;
And we all are either food, or sport or spoil,
For some cousin in the sea, or earth or air;
For in summer nature gaily
Gives us all our dinner daily,
So that each may be the other’s daily fare.
That’s the world of sage and soldier, field and
mart,
Of passion, love and hunger, thought and
deed,
Where each one must run his race and play
his part,
And everyone supply another’s need.
’Tis a carnival of courses,
In a meet of warring forces:
And the hawk and hare and hermit still
must feed.

Blossom at Night.
Come, see the night of floating frost!
On waving bush and thicket tossed
Enchantment glitters hoary;
With flowery sparkles sweet and warm
Here sways in Spring’s ecstatic storm
The tea-tree in its glory.
Twelve of the clock has struck, but 10,
The dark is all a pearly glow;
The cuckoos’ plaintive singing
Is eerie on the midnight air;
White wreaths of beauty everywhere
The tea-tree boughs are swinging.
Look how that shaken diadem •
Showers dew as out along the stem
Scampers a bright-eyed ’possum;
The fluting cuckoos sob and call —
Heaven’s silver starlights raining fall
On tea-tree’s silver blossom!

Five.
Oh, love! Here are five little songs I sing
For my five kisses on your golden hair,
And on your brow, and on your eyelids fail
As dewy petals closed at evening,
And on your mouth that rivals all the roses
When night is gone and morning sun is
here,
And on your dress, that when it’s gone
discloses
A flower I cannot find thought to compare.
Oh. love! My songs are like five silver doves,
That, though made free of all the lovely
sky
Return, still constant to their sheltered loves,
And always to the dear familiar fly ;
And though, like eager truants they have
pressed
Through joyous woods, and found a
gladness there,.
At end of day they come again to rest,
Upon your' breast and lips and eyes and
hair.

The Farthest North.
Away before the stretching eyes
The little valley lies;
And who would not be out with me along
the tropic way?
We sipped the wine of old romance when
we were fresh and strong,
But that was many years ago and many
miles along—
Ah mo, to breathe the golden air of farthest
north to-day!
Who knows the deep entrancing blue
In Murray-Prior’s view?
Or climbs again the coastal ridge to clamber
Bartle Frere?
Whose eyes recall the sombre spread of
bending fields of cane
When colored evens richly glowed to trash-
fires on the wane?
Ah me, to be in Queensland when the night
star shimmers there!
Below the gorge’s purple gloom
The valley gardens bloom;
And winding past the mountain road the
MulgraVe beckons here;
From the emerald South Pacific and the
ancient Coral Seas
The Barron hurtles forward with her
rhyme of centuries —
Ah me, to be in Queensland when the north
sun glitters there!
The storm —the cyclone-season’s best —
Tears frantic to the west
As outposts on the waterfront are stamped
and driven through;
The time-built, time-worn Barrier sinks
back in old-time pain
To meet the flashing fury of the foam-
fiend once again.
Ah me. a million victims grin a welcome for
the new!
Still I have seen the broad pale moon
Change tropic nights to noon ;
And I have seen the summer smile at Cairns
and Innisfail;
Lantanas blazed their impudence down
edgeways from the heat,
But crotons and hibiscus hearts flushed
liot-blood welcomes sweet —
Ah me, when tropic calls ring clear can
southern pleas prevail?

The Healers.
Hill and stream and swaying forest, shadow
haunted,
Are the healers God lias blessed;
Pride and strife and vain ambition
Die before their clearer vision;
Here the sad heart seeks for courage
And the weary find their rest.
The circling hills have power to make the
spirit
Free from every sordid bond,
Where the road goes winding over
Like a soul that would discover
All the magic of the mountains
And the hidden things beyond.
There is comfort in the long quiet dawning
When the slow stream, crystal clear,
>Ungs of many a glad to-morrow
,ike a spirit void of sorrow’
That has seen the vision splendid
And can never taste of fear.
Where the grey hills brood o’er valleys black
with shadow
There is solace in the dusk,
When the twilight’s tender fingers
Have a long caress that lingers,
\nd the shining dreams w r ake softly
From their sleep in rose and musk.

We sped on moonlit roads towards the dawn,
And in the south there hung a starry

By lilac hedges scented in the rain ;
I found truth naked when the cross swung
low—
That was my gain.

SOMETHING BESIDES WHEAT.
Flax-growing in this country began early,
promised well, and dropped out rather
unaccountably. In this respect it resembled
cotton, which made various false starts
with various brands of Government assist-
ance, and is now trying again—with Gov-
ernment assistance. N.S.W. was making its
own tablecloth out of its own primary pro-
duct 126 years ago, yet in 1925 the record
was that £6B worth of flax was grown in
Queensland, a trifle not worth separate
mention in Victoria, and none anywhere
else. In 1926 the article dropped entirely
out of the “Summary of Australian Produc-
tion Statistics.” Yet Australian flax sold in
England not long ago at £325 per ton,
which showed that there was nothing wrong
with the article. And out of the £10,573,345
which Australia spent in 1925-26 on im-
ported vegetable substances, £401.482 was
for flax and hemp, which, added to the ten
millions or so that were paid for the fibre
in its manufactured condition, showed that
there is nothing amiss with the local
market, provided it is seized firmly and
held tenaciously. Conversation is being
indulged in about the resumption of the
industry on an extensive scale, and, as the
raw material out of which the boiled shirt
of commerce has its origin is easy to grow,
there should be no difficulty. Still there
probably will be. Through conservatism,
lack of agricultural education and other
causes new vegetables are slow to take root
in Australia.
* * * *
Very few people realise how many agri-
cultural products this agricultural Com-
monwealth fails to supply in sufficient
quantity for its own requirements. During
the year to June, 1926, imports exceeded
exports in the matter of beans, peas, maize,
oats, rice, hops, nuts, onions, potatoes, lin-
seed, tobacco in its raw state, broom
millet, flax and hemp. In addition there
are in the “Summary” items which arc
simply set down as “other fibres,” “other
varieties of grain and pulse,” or “other
seeds.” They cover a vast number of odd-
ments lumped together, and the excess of
imports among the “others” amounted to
about £900,000. In a table which covers 11
years, it appears that imports have exceeded
exports at times even in such matters as
hay, chaff, straw, arrowroot, fresh fruits,
oatmeal (the export of this has almost dis-
appeared) and bran.

The one big and definite move in recent
years was in the matter of sugar. During
1920-21 the Commonwealth paid away
£6,339,408 to outside parties for this article.
In 1925-26 it received £5,303,710 from over-
sea for the same article, so the improve-
ment was £11,643,118. But for this revolu-
tionary change Australia might in some
years be more a buyer of agricultural pro-
duce than a seller, the same as the United
Kingdom. It really occupied that remark-
able position in 1914-15. The progress of
the sugar industry was due to blank pro-
hibition, and every hardshell Freetrader
in the land has risen at some time or other
and demonstrated to his own satisfaction
that the arrangement is economically un-
sound, and contrary to the divine revelation
which fell from Heaven and landed on the
head of Adam Smith. Still the £11,643,118
is a living reality, while Adam Smith is
a dead theory. There have been complica-
tions, certainly, for prosperity led to the
production of more sugar than the local
demand called for, and this wasn’t in the
calculation. Cane sugar being a nigger
product outside Australia, in which respect
it is unlike flax and hops and oats, the
white man’s surplus had to be sold abroad
at a loss. Still, even though there was
a book-keeping loss, the export brought
£5,303,710 to this country in 1925-26, and
the importation of nigger-grown sugar or
any other of the thousand victuals that
flesh is heir to brings nothing and takes
away much. If the Commonwealth pro-
hibited a few more imports, so that the
rush to get going would be spread over
various industries instead of being concen-
trated on one, it should be possible to
supply Australia’s requirements in a num-
ber of lines without an embarrassing excess
of over-production. It would be a matter
of time, and prohibition would have to be
introduced on the instalment plan; but time
is plentiful and the world is full of instal-
ment plans. The central fact is that Aus-
tralia must import a great deal less in order
that it may borrow less. In the matter of
sugar it has been managed, and even over-
done; and it can be managed quite as
easily with many score of other products.
CHOOSING A SPECIALIST.
The ideal specialist is a person who, after
a good general medical education, proceeds
by special training and only after a long,
arduous and faithful apprenticeship to the
principles and practice of his particular
branch of medicine or surgery, to fit him-
self to undertake the diagnosis and treat-
ment of certain groups of diseases. That
is what the medical profession understands
by the term “specialist.” The conception
of the laity is entirely different. According
to popular idea, anyone with a plate up
in Macquarie- or Collins-street is a special-
ist; and many practitioners take advantage
of the ignorance of the people.
How does a doctor specialise? He does
so in one of several ways:—
(1) He goes through the ordinary medical
course, takes his University degree, and then
serves for a period as house doctor at a
public hospital. He then goes abroad, and
makes an intensive study in his destined
specialty. He may or may not take further
diplomas or degrees. This is not of any real
significance. They give him a certain
amount of cosmopolitan status, profession-
ally, but they are merely a receipt for work
done. Men without these additional honors
tend to underestimate their value; the for-
tunate ones who possess them tend to have
an exaggerated notion of their importance.
The truth probably lies between these two
points of view.
(2) He may remain on at his hospital for
several years, and finally attain to a senior
post, such as medical superintendent. As a
reward for his services lie is appointed, when
a vacancy occurs, to a position on the
honorary staff. In many but not in all cases
his specialty will thus be forced on him, as
he will be compelled to practise in private
that particular branch of medical science
which corresponds to his hospital appoint-
ment. In many cases this will be unsatis-
factory, as he need not necessarily be deeply
interested in his specialty.
(3) Some men just drift into specialism.
Tour successful country doctor, bored stiff
with the dull life in Woop Woop, may decide
to settle in Brisbane or Sydney. W ithout
any particular qualifications or expert train-
ing, he decides to take up X-ray. work or
eye diseases. He relies for his clientele on
his “following" from his previous place of
practice, or from his friends within the pro-
fession. Again, the suburban doctor who
“does his own surgery” (God forgive him!)
will decide to commence practice in “The
Street,” simultaneously carrying on his ordi-
nary general practice in Balmain or Fitz-
roy. This was the popular method of
specialising 25 years ago, when Sydney and
Melbourne were comparatively tenth-rate,
provincial towns, as regards population, at
any rate. These communities have now
passed the stage of civic puberty, and for this
reason alone this inefficient short-cut to
specialisation can be no longer tolerated.
Let us now consider the question from
another angle. We shall walk down the
correct “consulting” or “doctors’ ” street of
one of our Australian capitals, and see if
we are able to classify them, and pick out
the sheep from the goats. Roughly speak-
ing, we may divide them into three groups:
(1) Those who practise only as consul-
tants in their particular specialty, and only
at one address. These doctors are usually
attached to a big teaching hospital, and are,
in many cases, official lecturers in their sub-
jects at their universities.
(2) Suburban doctors, perhaps with an
appointment on the staff of a suburban hos-
pital, who are in general practice, and who
come into the city for an hour a day, or an
hour a week, according to the size of their
alleged specialist following. They charge
consultant fees in the city and suburban fees
in the suburbs. That is to say, you may
consult Dr. X at his rooms in town for two
guineas, and get precisely the same opinion
at Mosman or Toorak for the nimble half-
guinea. He is doing one of two things—
either grossly overcharging his city . patient,
or giving only a quarter of his brain-power
and skill to his suburban customer. He can-
not have it both ways. This kind of conduct
is both dishonest and unethical. This breed
of specialist is very prevalent and makes up
50 per cent, of the rent-payers in Macquarie
and Collins streets. In many cases, poor
chap, he is not to blame. Many an honest
fellow lias been jockeyed into this invidious
position by an ambitious, social-climbing
wife, who likes to think that her husband has
a city practice. Our social, political, busi-
ness and industrial life tends to suggest that
we Australians are a nation of snobs. Medi-
cine is not exempt from this generalisation.
(B) The last group will consist of the
noble Quack Brigade, the chiropractics, the
electric-chair merchants and others of that
ilk. In this category we must place those
more or less respectable practitioners who
bespatter their plates with their particular
line of business, such as “blood diseases,”
“nerves,” “diseases of women,” etc. Many
of these people are members of the British
Medical Association, and the fact that that
institution tolerates this kind of thing is
really not surprising.
Having briefly reviewed the facts, how is
the public to be advised in the choice of a
consultant? There is no golden rule, but,
in the vast majority of cases, the following
suggestions will be a valuable guide:—
(1) Always speak to your own family
doctor on the subject of a consultation or a
second opinion. He will send you to “the
right shop.” His advice on the matter is
much more valuable than the opinion of the
garrulous washerwoman or a friendly lava-
tory attendant.
(2) Inquire as to the status, hospital
appointments and experience of the consult-
ant whom you propose to visit. It is much
better to have the opinion and advice of a
doctor who is dealing every day of his work-
ing life with the particular malady from
which you happen to be suffering.
(3) Do not be afraid of paying a decent
fee. It will be the cheapest way out of your
troubles in the long run. There is no such
thing as a “good cheap doctor.” There are
plenty of bad cheap ones.
(4) Avoid those greedy, impertinent sub-
urban doctors who are neither flesh, fowl nor
good red herring, and who are striving to do
two jobs. They usually do both indifferently.
(5) Do not mistrust Youth per se. A few
grey hairs are very comforting, but experi-
ence is not everything. One knows and sees
many surgeons who, if they were to live to
be a hundred, would never become good
operators. They start off as muddlers, and
muddle through their whole career. The
trouble is that there is no medical Musso-
lini to declare: “You are doing bad work.
Desist.”
(6) Chemists, nurses and massage people
are. on the whole, poor judges of a doctor’s
qualifications to deal with a particular
trouble. In addition, they frequently have
axes to grind, as many practitioners, for
business reasons, deliberately court the
favor of the allied professions.
Finally, if the consultant tries to “pinch”
you from the doctor that sent you to him,
for ever more avoid him like poisom More-
over, tell all your friends about it. That is
the dirtiest trick that can be played in
the whole game of Medicine. A good
honest consultant will not only welcome
but demand the co-operation of your own
doctor.
Quack.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Safety at Sea.
The whole essence of that branch of sea-
manship which deals with navigation,
pilotage, the handling of ships and the rule
of the road is to make certain beforehand,
and, if one cannot make certain, to allow
sufficient margin for even the most unlikely
contingencies.
The most flawless set of rules in existence
are the International Regulations for Pre-
venting Collisions at Sea. and there is
nothing more certain than that, if the facts
can be established, blame for a maritime
disaster can be apportioned with absolute
accuracy. But even these Regulations
admit that, they may on occasions cease to
function through either negligence or
ignorance or for some other reason, for
they draw a sharp distinction between two
periods prior to a collision or the avoidance
thereof. The first period is that in which
two vessels may possibly collide; every-
thing proceeds normally till the one whose
duty it is to do so makes the alteration of
course or speed which obviates the colli-
sion. The second period commences when
the ship which should ‘‘give way” neglects
to do so and collision becomes “imminent.”
In such a case the Regulations state that
nothing elsewhere contained in the Rules
shall exempt the master of any ship from
taking every possible step to avoid a col-
lision. In other words, the vessel which
has the right of way may not go blithely
on and allow herself to collide if there is
anything she could have done to save the
situation.
Every good seaman bears this Regulation
in mind and studiously avoids placing his
vessel in a position in which he will be
helpless if the rules are disobeyed by the
other ship. Such a master always has some
extra speed or sea-room in hand for an
emergency, so that if, though not in the
first period called upon to act, he finds
action imperative when the second period
begins, he will have something up his sleeve
and may be able to take some step which
will obviate a. catastrophe. In other words,
he avoids putting himself in the position of
having to answer the question “Why did
you allow the situation to develop to the
point where you could not yourself prevent
the collision?” Hence one finds that sea-
officers are always inclined to regard the
officer in charge of every other vessel in
sight as a perfect fool, the helmsman as
a bigger one, and the other ship’s steering-
gear as utterly defective and unreliable.
Such an attitude is the maritime safety-
factor, and whenever a collision occurs in
good visibility—day or night—one may be
quite certain that some seaman’s safety-
factor has been mislaid.
A motor-car rounding a comer may find
an old woman or a stray dog in a place
where no such thing should be. Brakes can
be applied in the twinkling of an eye, or
a turn of the wheel can save the ambulance,
human or canine, a journey. But at sea,
with even a small vessel, eyes don’t twinkle
quite so fast, and the inertia of the ship
becomes a factor of the utmost import-
ance. In a motor-car a necessity conceived
becomes an order executed before even it
can be expressed in words. At sea a neces-
sity can be conceived and an order given
many long seconds before the effect can
possibly be felt. The movements of any
vessel of any size are inevitable for the
next half-minute at least, and the seaman
must therefore allow for the possibilities of
at least that length of time ahead of him.
The safety-factor which good seamanship
demands was missing in either the Tahiti
or the Greycliffe, or in both. In the cir-
cumstances it would seem impossible that
both vessels can be exonerated.

An Audit of N.S.W. Accounts.
The report of the N. S. Wales Auditor-
General on the finances of the year 1926-
27 contains a mass of instructive and dis-
astrous-looking figures, but very little of
the acrid comment which might have been
based on them had the high official felt so
inclined. It covers a good deal of history
for the last 19 years or so, and these are
some of the features: —
The accumulated surplus was at its best
in 1907-08 (£1,676,923) under Carruthers
and Wade. The last of it was spent under
McGowen in 1911-12, and there has been
none since. The biggest accumulated deficit
(£4,705,118) was under Lang in 1925-26.
The second biggest (£3,578,263) was under
the previous Labor Government, which in-
cluded Lang.
A sinking fund of a very inadequate
£350,000 per annum was founded by the
See-Waddell-Carruthers crowd in 1964.
It was suspended by Holman (then a Labor
Premier) in 1914, and only a few pounds
have been paid in since.
Expenditure has more than doubled since
1915-16.
The nominally reproductive debt is
£174,594,628, and the unproductive debt is
£55,433,014, so there is a very large dead
horse in the ointment. A lot of the loan
works are not permanent, either. Few
things are.
In recent years it has become a habit to
bury loan funds in odd-and-eud enterprises,
said to be “progressive” or “developmental.”
The biggest one is Murrumbidgee Irrigation
(£8,579,756), and the smallest are “To
settlers for wheatgrowing” (£453) and
“Cement works” (£358). Th,ere are 4a
separate odds-and-ends. They represent
£55,433,014 of loan money, and of this
£43,777,081 is wholly unproductive. So we
meet the dead horse again.
The interest which N.S.W. has to pay.
quite apart from its share of the interest on
the war debt, is £11,215,341 per annum.
It increased during last year by £887,822.
which is the biggest increase on record.
In 1915 the interest on the public debt
was £3 13s. 4d. per cent. For the year just
closed it was £5 2s. 7d. per cent. When fool
Governments are out to borrow extra-
ordinary sums in a bad market and for all
manner of unproductive purposes, interest
goes up.
During 1926-27 N.S.W. lost £1.015.781
through raising loans at a discount when its
credit was bad. Though that sum became
part of the pex-manent debt, the State didn't
receive a penny of it. The bulk of the loss
(£656,363) was made on the Lang Govern-
ment’s money-raising campaign in New
York.
The Auditor-General mentions “the policy
of raising just sufficient loan moneys abroad


to meet the commitments in London, which
average £7,000,000 annually.” The mean-
ing is, of course, that the new loan abroad
is required to pay interest on old loans
abroad. This process raised N.S.W.’s exter-
nal liabilities from 80J millions in 191.4 to
154 J millions in 1927. If nothing can be
done to prevent a rise to 300 millions in
1940, when the commitments will be very
much larger, embarrassments may arise
about which the Auditor-General offers no
opinion.
The Lang Government, under pressure,
created a new and definite sinking fund,
but as the arrangement only comes into
operation in July, 1928, the new Govern-
ment will have to find the money. It will
be a serious addition to the “commitments
in London,” which, as already mentioned,
are met out of other people’s money.
Between June, 1926, and June, 1927, the
State paid off £12,909,425 of old loans, by
raising a much larger amount in new loans.
Out of all these millions the sum repaid in
London was £4OO. This goes to show that
it is much easier to pay local debts, which
can be done by sticking on a new tax and
collecting some paper money, than to pay
external ones. The latter require a surplus
of exports over imports, and to make that
surplus involves toil. To borrow £14,272,573
abroad and only repay £4OO meant that the
State was being pawned to the foreign capi-
talist at some pace.
Whether it is viewed as an ordinary report
or as a dissertation on crooked finance
which if persisted in can have only one
end, the Auditor-General has turned out
an interesting document.

Being Dead Yet Speaketli.
Charles Greville, author of the once
again famous—or infamous, as one chooses
to regard them—Greville Memoirs, was one
of the most interesting figures in that
welter of roues, gamblers, spendthrifts and
semi-madmen which lives in history as the
Regency. A boon companion of George
the Fourth both as Prince and King, of
Sheridan, Fox, Brummell and a hundred
other eccentrics of those ungodly days, he
lived far into the middle of the reformed
nineteenth century, knowing everyone, go-
ing everywhere and regarded with trepida-
tion by all whose fortunes threw them in
contact with him. As Clerk of the Privy
Council, he held for years a high sinecure
which gave him every opportunity to
observe political events, and his birth and
standing assured him of social prestige. In
spite of their obvious failings, the Memoirs
may fairly claim to take their place with
the diaries of Evelyn and Pepys as a vivid
if not unimpeachable chronicle of the
writer’s times.
The most arrant of snobs, and even
less inclined to suffer fools gladly than
most of his elaborately insolent contempo-
raries, with a savage wit of his own, it was
small wonder that w T hen the Memoirs were
first published (1874) his editor cut them
heavily, and that even then they infuriated
half English society, from good Queen Vic-
toria down, and delighted the other half.
The recent publication in England of the
full text has roused comment almost as
sulphurous; but since all concerned are
dead this many a year, the savagery carries
a less personal taint. But it is well to
remember, amid all the shocked outcry,
that many of Greville’s contemporaries,
including the leading journals, wrote and
printed much the same sort of thing even
of the young Queen, and of her parents
and uncles “the Dreadful Dukes” much
that was a great deal worse and infinitely
more brutal.
Yet this crabbed personality would seem
to have harbored some unsuspected kinks.
As one of the lovers of that somewdiat
sordid trollop who was later to be famous
as Lady Hamilton —few of his genre and
day escaped that experience—he has been
immortalised by her tearful letter to him-
when her protector of the hour had left
her in the lurch. “Oh Greville, what shall
I dow, what shall I dow?” she wrote, and
the crusty Charles melted sufficiently to
loosen his purse-strings and come to the
rescue. And there is that strange story of
the daughter by the Italian dancer, the
child w-ho later became a countess. Both
Greville and “Old Q.,” the infamous Mar-
quis of Queensberry, were each convinced
that she was his daughter, and accordingly
lavished care and tenderness on her up-
bringing. And it is said both were in error.
Greville’s character had other facets.
William Day, Nestor of trainers, tells
bitterly how Greville commissioned him to
buy a racehorse at auction, and then repudi-
ated the commission. It was Greville,
too, who, when his filly Preserve was a red-
hot favorite for the Oaks of 1834, had her
nostrils painted with a mixture of flour,
starch and coloring matter, to simulate
symptoms of influenza. This had the
desired effect of sending the filly back to
a long price, when Greville and his noble
friend Lord George Bentinck hopped in.
Disraeli, a marvellous judge of mankind,
summed up Greville’s failings as con-
cisely and correctly as any when some-
one told him that the old man was dead.
Said the great Hebrew: “He was the most
conceited person with whom I have ever
been brought in contact, and I have read
Cicero and known Bulwer Lytton.”

Mostly Tin Hares.
The late N.S.W. Labor Government, while
sullenly hostile to “capitalists” like those
who started the Newcastle Steelworks, had
a warm regard for the philanthropists who
exploit the craze for betting. Its Gaming
and Betting “Amendment” Bill provided
certain proprietary racing interests and Me-
Shortodds with a profusion of additional
dates; and it is to be hoped the bene-
ficiaries were properly grateful. Then,
although Parliament had struck out a
clause permitting betting on tin-hare cours-
ing, the Government issued an uncondi-
tional betting license under the old Gaming
Act to a tin-hare syndicate headed by a
gentleman from America, “Judge” Swin-
dell or Swindells. The license was as
good as a fortune to the Swindell (or
Swindells) syndicate, and McShortodds,
of course, helped himself.
The boom in tin-hare coursing was
accompanied by a boom in the promotion
of tin-hare companies. N.S.W. people were
invited to finance these enterprises to the
extent of £300,000. The promoters were
mostly bookmakers and other Friends of
the Workers, and the public was given to
understand that the Workers’ Government
had come to light with betting licenses or
would issue them for the asking. Getting
a betting license from a Workers’ Gov-
ernment seemed as easy as falling into a
drain. But this was only the case in N. S.
Wales, as the tin-hare brotherhood was
soon to discover. W T hen tin-hare literature
began to circulate in Victoria, Hogan, the
Labor Premier, announced that betting
would not be allowed. Being advised that
it would be legal in boroughs and shires
under the present law, provided McShort-
odds “did not bet on a stand or box,” he
said the law would be amended before
Parliament went into recess. McCormack,
the Queensland Labor Premier, was equally
unsympathetic. He did not try to prevent
the introduction of tin-hare coursing as a
spectacle, but a bookmaker caught fielding
at the first meeting in Brisbane was fined
£25 or two months; another was fined £2O,
with the same default. The other three
State Governments, two of them Labor,
also made it clear that the Slang-Whang
precedent would not be followed by them.
The Tin-Hare Ministry was bundled out
neck and crop. The Bavin-Buttenshaw
Government, on going into matters, found
that the licenses handed out by Gosling,
the Minister of Tin Hares, enabled the
favored companies to race day or night and
as often as they pleased (the non-pro-
prietary A.J.C. is restricted on both points)
and exempted the tin-hare McShortodds
from the betting taxes imposed on A.J.C.
bookmakers. The result in Sydney was
that the Swindell (or Swindells) co. was
racing two nights a week, and two more
night meetings a week were threatened by
another co. Preparations were also being
made to introduce night trotting, two
licenses for that pastime—with betting, of
course—having been granted by Gosling,
a most obliging young goose. The new Gov-
ernment announced last week that it had
decided to prohibit betting “at any night
sporting fixture” except in the case of
meetings already advertised.
This is fairly satisfactory for a start, but
a good deal more is required. Betting on
tin-hare chasing should be outlawed
altogether, unless the mechanical hare is
substituted for the live variety’ by non-
proprietary clubs whose genuineness is un-
questionable. The new Government is not
bound to renew licenses issued in reckless
defiance of the principle, previously
accepted by both parties, that there should
be no extension of proprietary racing in
any form. Rather should it take steps to
remove the blight of proprietary racing by
compelling the conversion of pony-racmg
companies and the like into clubs on the
A.J.C. and V.R.C. model.
4
Unemployed.
Scenes of a sort with which Sydney has
been familiar for half a century were re-
enacted last week when a mob invaded Par-
liament and demanded work for “starving
thousands” of unemployed and another
mob treated itself to free meals at the
Government restaurant at the Central
Station. It was natural that an early
opportunity should be taken to expose the
Bavin-Buttenshaws as grinders of the
faces of the poor, heartless oppressors, and
myrmidons of the capitalistic octopus. But
Labor administrations have had exactly
the same experiences, and have been con-
demned just as heartily. “Send the bill to
Bavin,” said the gentlemen who had dined
heartily at the Government’s expense. It
used to be ‘ Send the bill to Dooley.”
These manifestations, though usually en-
gineered for some ulterior purpose, are a
reminder that Sydney has, chronically, a
large number of unemployed. In the early
’nineties a popular vaudeville ballad invited
all and sundry to come along to New South
Wales —“a really lovely , land, where you get
ten bob a day just for shifting sand.” And
sandshifting. or its equivalent of digging
holes and filling them up again, has been the
staple occupation provided by the city of
Sydney and the State of N.S.W. for more
years than one cares to remember. The
plain fact is that the borrowing policies, of
both the State and the bloated munici-
pality have created a huge permanent army
of day-laborers. To ' keep this army em-
ployed—or making, some show of being
employed—has become the principal pre-
occupation of politicians of all brands. A
vicious circle has been created. Loans
necessitate the employment of thousands of
day-laborers, and the existence of thou-
sands of day-laborers necessitates further
loans to keep them employed.
There is a remedy in sight, but the cura-
tive process must necessarily be slow. The
prescription is compulsory technical train
ing for boys, the fostering of existing skilled
industries and the establishment of new
ones, abandonment of the foreign-loan
policy, and a substantial differentiation be-
tween the standard of living attained by
skilled and unskilled labor.

Why Kail Freights Are So High.
The Commonwealth Railways Commis-
sioner tossed some good meat into the
stew that is being made by the Royal
Commission on the Constitution, when he
gave evidence on the need for a uniform rail-
way gauge and the necessity for immediate
control of such important preliminaries as
standard rolling stock and standard clear-
ances of tunnels, platforms and other struc-
tures.
The spectacle of N. S. Wales trains halt-
ing at the northern and southern borders
and discharging their freight into separate
sets of rolling stock is enough to cause any
Australian with a spark of economical
sense to feel ashamed of his country’s gov-
ernment. Because these trains—some of
them worth £BO,OOO of capital money—are
allowed to stare at one another across the
borders, Australian railways have a great
many more of them than they really need
under ordinary sane conditions, and this
is why the taxpayer has £53,367,000 tied up
in rolling stock incurring an annual interest
bill at 5 p.c. of £2,668,000 and a maintenance
expenditure of over £8,000,000 per annum.
Here are some comparisons of Australia’s
mainland systems with South Africa, where
the rolling stock can move about instead of
being kept in paddocks:—
Australia. S’Africa.
Total earnings .. .. £45,579,475 £24,151,407
Miles operated .. .. 24,705 12,481
Train miles 67,511,320 44,329,030
Total value of rolling stock 53,367,000 20,819,935
Earnings per £lOOO in-
vested in rolling stock.. 854 1,159
Train miles run per £lOOO
invested in rolling stock 1,265 2,129
It will be seen that in Australia our £lOOO
invested in vehicles that cannot get out of
their own State owing to the gauge outrage
earns £854 whereas in South Africa it earns
£1159. South Africans get 2129 train miles
for their money and Australia gets a little
more than half.
Cost of handling goods at transhipping
stations at the modest figure of 2s. per ton,
the irritating and expensive delays and the
restrictions on traffic which these entail, are
only some of the other gauge evils which
choke the arteries of Australia’s transporta-
tion systems. Can it be wondered at that
our £288,000,000 asset returns only a little
over 2 p.c.?
The gauge muddle started when there
was no Federation to insist on unification;
but this excuse does not serve any longer.

The Relative Importance of Things.
The House of Reps, devoted the whole of
last week to a no-confidence debate, from
which neither side emerged with any glory,
on the Commonwealth Shipping Line. The
question was whether this bankrupt and
job-controlled concern should be sold on
conditions which will render a sale difficult,
or should go on consuming from £500,000
to £750,000 p.a. of the public revenues and
fiurnishing dangerous examples of mobs
triumphing over constituted authority.
Naturally, Matthew Charlton's party
was for carrying on the ill-starred under-
taking regardless of the cost in money
and humiliation, and it was supported by
P. G. Stewart, the Freetectionist from the
Wimmera. Also, it was joined by W. M.
Hughes, who has never forgiven Bruce
and Page for v-hat happened on February
9, 1923, and who, though it suits him to sit
for the most Conservative of constituencies,
is still a State socialist of the hang-the-
expense sort.
A few days before this futile discussion
was started an immeasurably more import-
ant matter came up. At long last the
Government presented a statement showing
the actual expenditure on the military
forces from the introduction of the com-
pulsory-training scheme. Previously this
was inextricably mixed up with the war,
war works and war pensions accounts, but
the true position has now been revealed and
it is serious. The essential fact is that, in
spite of the increased population and the
reduced purchasing power of money, the
Commonw-ealth is spending a great deal
less on the military forces than it did
before the war. In 1912-13 the military ex-
penditure was £2,277,000 and in 1913-14 (the
population being then 4,900.000) it was
£2,356,000. Last year (population, 6,150,000)
it declined to £1,526,000. As one result,
there were only 42,000 youths under train-
ing at the end of the year, although 93,375
registered, and it is estimated that 160,000
were liable.
This information was supplied in answer
to questions asked by W. M. Hughes, but
it did not even, inspire him to move the
adjournment of the House. He reserved
his thunders for the projected. sale of a
Government line of steamers which has be-
come the joke of the Seven Seas.

Small Sister’s Experiments.
Tas. Parliament is asked to sanction the
payment of Premier Lyons’s expenses on
his proposed trip to London, and it will be
£lOOO well invested. In addition to the
usual “cogent reasons” given by State
Premiers for taking a trip to the Owed
Land, there is the fact that Tasmania re-
quires a modification of the terms of the
Migration Agreement to enable her to
make use of some of the cheap money
John Bull offers under that agreement;
and visiting Dominions-Secretary Amery
has dropped a hint that Lyons’s personal
application at headquarters would probably
secure the desired modification. Lyons
declares that he would much rather stay
home than take the voyage, but he is
willing to sacrifice himself, or words to that
effect.
As the elections are due in June next,
and as Lyons’s absence from the
strife will make a considerable difference
to his party’s fighting strength, it may hap-
pen that the ear-biting expedition will cost
him the Premiership. With Albert Ogil-
vie out of the Cabinet and Premier Lyons
out of the State, the capable Ministerial
leadership necessary to enable Labor to
hold its slight majority in a hotly-contested
election battle may not be available.
Already political circles are discussing the
possibility of the elections resulting in a
dead heat, and some sort of coalition
administration becoming necessary to
bridge the difficulty. There is even serious
talk of the little State adopting The
Bulletin’s idea of an Elective Ministry.
Meanwhile, it is not without interest, as
showing a weakening of party virulence, to
note that the Lyons Government’s Esti-
mates for the year have been put through
without a single division!
♦
New Guinea Needs.
Tile latest idea of the Federal Government
for abating the mess that its own ineptness
has landed it into in the New Guinea. Man-
dated Territory is to call a conference to
consider whether it should not be possible
for greater co-operation to be obtained in
the administration of the adjoining terri-
tories of Papua and New Guinea. To that
end the Administrator of New Guinea and
the Lieut.-Governor of Papua are to be
invited to a conference with some of the
Canberra bureaucrats. This may yield
helpful results to New Guinea, but nothing
likely to.be in the least useful to Papua.
The systems of government of the two
places, though under the same direction,
are as wide apart as the Poles. Papua
began in its shirt sleeves and with the
minimum of swank, under Dr. Macgregor,
over half a century ago, and has continued
in its shirt sleeves and still without swank,
till it can boast of a house now fairly well
set in order. New Guinea, taken over by
a brass-hat regime from German bureau-
cracy, has continued the brass-hat tradition
ever since, though military control is sup-
posed to have ended long ago. That is
why, having to face civilian conditions, the
Administration has been a continuous fail-
ure and an exasperation to all fated to
come under its jurisdiction.
What is wanted in New Guinea is not so
much co-operation with a more successful
neighbor which has its work cut out to
look after its own affairs, but an entire
revision of the organisation of the Admini-
stration, a drastic pruning of the personnel,
and a rigid policy of non-interference with
the Territory’s affairs by cheap and casual
politicians with an addiction to attacks of
nepotism.
For a long time past the two British socie-
ties which form the trade union *of the
masters and officers of the Merchant Ser-
vice have been engaged in an unsuccessful
attempt to absorb each other. In con-
sequence the older members of the Mer-
chant Service have at last decided to join
in a body which, while leaving trade-union
matters to the societies already existing,
will endeavor to weld the masters into a
united body. The functions of the new
Company of Master Mariners will be to
guide the brethren in all questions on which
it is considered that guidance is necessary.
The ever-changing conditions which affect
all professions, and none more so than the
sea, need the close study and constant
attention of a power which can express
opinions and speak with authority. The
training of officers of the Merchant Ser-
vice, the problems associated with the
introduction of new factors in navigation
(wireless, gyro-compasses, sonic depth-
finding, etc.), the relation of the Navy and
the Merchant Service in time of war, the
arming of merchant ships, the R.N.R., the
revision of maritime laws —these are among
the many questions in respect of which an
independent and expert body is likely to be
able to render service to the Mercantile
Marine and the nation. It is not too much
to hope that, when the parent body is
firmly established in the confidence of sea-
farers, branch companies will come into
being in each of the Dominions.
"Chancery Lane”: The remarks of “Q.N.”
(B. 27/10/’27) regarding the dangers attend-
ing the widespread practice of men putting
property in the names of their wives recall
the anomaly which exists in the law of dis-
tribution of an intestate man’s estate and
that of a woman dying without a will. In
Victoria, in the first case, if there are no
issue of the marriage, the wife is entitled to
the whole estate if under £1000: if over
that amount, she is granted the first thou-
sand and one half of the balance with in-
terest at 4 p.c. from date of the husband’s
death until payment. If the wife, however,
dies intestate without issue, the husband is
entitled to only a half of the nett estate,
her next of kin taking the other half. As
in the. majority of cases, the estate has been
put into the wife’s name by the, husband as
a provision for her in case of his death
first, it. appears only equitable that if she
predeceases him he should at least, benefit
to the same extent as she would if he died
first. Of course, why not make a will?

POLITICAL
POINTS
Prime Minister Bruce had his usual habit
of being incomplete when he first unsuccess-
fully offered the Commonwealth Shipping Line
for sale, and he has it again. There are not
so many conditions this time, but he wants
to find a purchaser who will keep the ships
on a British Empire register and maintain
for 10 years a service equal to the present
one. He will get less for the ships with
these restrictions, and when shipping lines
are so plentiful there is no visible gain in
demanding that one owner shall keep seven
craft on the Australian run for a brief 10
j-ears.
The recent hold-up of the passenger
steamer Katoomba at Fremantle had the
peculiarity that no reason was assigned.
The vessel couldn’t sail without a full com-
plement of firemen, and the complement
simply neglected to transpire. A theory
arose that the row inside the union between
Walsh and Johanson might be responsible.
Internal rows are now almost as common as
cats, and tbs policy now is to seek surcease
from sorrow by annoyiug the public.
Bailey, Vic. Minister for Lands, has made
enough profit for the State out of one trans-
action to pay Cabinet salaries for two
years. The Immigration Bureau, Russell-
street, Melbourne, which was bought by his
department four or five years ago for
£20,000, has been sold for £40,000. At first
Bailey fixed the upset at £50,000 for a
sale in August, but there was no bid. Then
he chanced £40,000, and got it.
The loss on the Queensland railways
reached the incredible figure of £1,964,365
last year, in spite of a 10 per cent, increase
in fares and freight rates dating from Aug.,
1926. Yet the railwaymen’s union came
along with the usual demand for a thumping
increase in wages. The Board of Arbitra-
tion in refusing it drily mentioned that the
average wage on the Queensland railways
was £297 p.a., and that the net revenue per
employee was £97 in 1924-25, £49 in 1925-26,
and £4l in 1926-27.
The retrenchment in the S. Aus. Railway
Department is only a small part of a heroic
plan for putting the State finances in
order. To provide for an estimated shortage
of a million or so Premier-Treasurer Butler
is reducing the income-tax exemption from
£l5O to £lOO, increasing the super-tax on
incomes and the tax on amusements, impos-
ing super-taxes on land values and dead-men’s
property, and adding to railway freight
rates and fares, harbor and wharfage dues,
sewerage and water-works charges, stamp
duties, license fees and hospital rates. It is
the inevitable consequence of reckless bor-
rowing and Beeby awards.
The crumbled pomp of ex-Premier Slang
is gloomily indicated in the columns of
S. M. Herald. When he was Premier his
every utterance was given a prominent posi-
THE GILDED CAGE.
“The latest published figures state that Canberra has cost over £8,000,000 to date. Civil servants still complain bitterly of the conditions under
they live and work at the Capital.” .„
THE DEAR OLD LADY: "You ungrateful bird—to talk like that after all I’ve spent on your cage!"
tion generally alongside the cablegrams. The
other day his customary reply to Bavin was
stowed away on a back page next to a
column advertising “dogs, cats, ferrets, etc.
China is a place where big things are done
in a small way. Lately there was a mutiny
among some. Nationalist troops—the people
who were once taken for stern patriots
like Garibaldi’s Thousand, but are now
rather hard to identify'. They demanded
their arrears of pay, amounting txr Is. Sd.
each Two ringleaders were beheaded, which
was 3s. 4d. The remainder being paid, Free-
dom’s battle resumed at the old address. •
The Hogan Ministry is trying to do a few
things for Victoria. It is preparing a bid
under which the outer ports which count
for anything are to be put under elected
harbor boards with large powers for their
improvement. It proposes to introduce the
long-overdue tote. And it is making good
progress with a law for the stern regulation
of estate-agents, the shady variety of whom
ought to be regulated out of existence. If it
could supply itself with a little more back-
bone where the inevitable economy m con-
cerned, it would be doing hue.
While the Queensland Railway Depart-
ment was piling up its twelfth and vastest
deficit (£1,904,365) the Westralian railways
paid working expenses and interest and con-
tributed £34,500 towards the sinking fund.
Gauge (3ft. Gin.), basic wage (£4 55.) and
working week (41 hours) are the same in
both States, but Poiie, the Westralian Com-
missioner, isn’t obliged to employ three men
where there is only work for two.
You might have thought that in its deal-
ings with Big Business interests a loan-hunt-
ing Commonwealth would leave its annoying
red tape at home. But it can’t. The Govern-
ment recently advertised that holders of
certain bonds could have them redeemed at
face value, plus interest. One Sydney firm
sending up a parcel of. say. £10,105 was told
that in accordance with the rules it could
only redeem m multiples of 10; therefore
the Treasury would pay the £lO,lOO, but the
£5 must remain until December 15. It
means a ridiculous waste in book-keeping;
but what matter so long as Red Tape pre-
vails !
The Federal Committee of Public Accounts
has reported that the clauses in the Naviga-
tion Act which reserve the coastal ship-
ping trade for Australian vessels are a dud
and should be treated accordingly. It could
hardly do anything else. The idea was to
build up the Australian mercantile marine,
and the effect being the reverse why go on?
A decision of the Queensland Board of
Trade and Arbitration is worth noting in
N. S. Wales. A union raised the question
of preference, a firm having employed two
men, for 16 and 14 years respectively, who
were not members of the organisation. The
men offered to join, but the union executive
haughtily replied that the books were closed.
To its vast astonishment, it was informed by
W. J. Dunstan, himself an ex-A.W.U. secre-
tary, that it would not be allowed to condemn
fellow-workman to permanent unemployment.
Soviet Russia celebrated the 10th anniver-
sary of its Sovietism with a military review
at Moscow, during which the fallen Trotsky
wandered around in search of a hearing, and
once contrived to get a few workmen to
listen while he stated that llussia couldii t
afford a war. On the same day Lloyd
George was bitterly denouncing the British
Government for not disarming a lot more.
Britain’s purely voluntary army consisted,
by latest advices, of 142,432 men and offi-
cers actually serving, with another 61,543 in
India, and the Navy is a sketchy, thing com-
pared with its old self. But the little bustler
lias apparently gone back to his pre-war
belief that if his country had nothing to
defend itself with no one would be so mean
as to attack it.
The N.S.W. Bavin Government suffered
a dud no-confidence motion because of its
refusal to go on with the hopeless criminal-
libel prosecutions which followed .the waste
of £5OOO on the Piddington Commission.
Lang, in delivering the indictment, aban-
doned his customary style, which is simple
and dii-ect, for Macaulayfiowers of rhetoric.
A sample:—
Was this high and trusted judicial officer, the ser-
vant of his Majesty the King, to have had all these
things said to him, his office discredited, his character
attacked, his personal integrity defamed, and when
the lies and misrepresentations are exposed and a
commission of the highest integrity finds no warrant
whatever for these reckless and defamatory state-
ments, is that then all the public of this country
is to get in satisfaction?
There are only two men in Sydney capable
of such beauties, and nobody suspects ex-
Town Clerk N.esbit.
When Hughes got on his feet in the House
of Keps. to demand the retention of the Com-
monwealth Shipping Line he was the old
Hughes-—eloquent, and as elusive as a bag
of cats. The principal points which he
dodged were that the annual loss on the
handful of ships is increasing; that it would
be more like a million than £595,000 but
for the fact that over eight millions of the
original capital has been written off (not
paid off) ; and that no one knows how the
ships chn be replaced when they wear out
except by showing a much bigger loss or by
doing the writing-down swindle a second
time. If William of Wales could have per-
suaded his old union pals to treat the Line
with even moderate civility in return for
high wages and exceedingly liberal conditions
it would have improved the situation, but
the situation is now hopeless.
The Federal Ministry of Health lately
decided that it wanted £lOO,OOO worth of
radium for the treatment of cancer. The
substance is produced in South Aus., and
S.A. radium is already used in this country.
It is said that rumors of a Government order
got abroad as far back as July, and that a
local supply was offered, the reply being that
the department knew nothing, but would keep
the matter in view if it happened to know
something later on. Now the order has been
sent abroad, and this is the rcmarkablt
official explanation:—
Complaints that Australian radium have not beer
purchased are unjustifiable. Two of every nine
women who die between the ages of 45 and o 6 years
are victims of cancer, and in these creumstances
the Ministry would not have beep justified in delay
ing the purchase for even a day.
And eight out of every nine men who can't
get early attention for their wives m cases ot
cancer and other disease are in that position
because short-sighted Governments send
money and work and wages abroad instead ot
keeping all three at home.
The Queensland Auditor-General reports
that “sundry debtors” owe the Parliamen-
tary refreshment-rooms £94 11s. 4d. —or
did on June 30. Queensland always was a
friendly sort of place when it came to sticK-
ing up meals and drinks.
WHERE THE SLAVES SCORED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Speaking in the N.S.W. Assembly, Mv. Olde
said that as a student of political economy and
history he believed that the workers of to-day were
in a worse position than the Greek and Roman slaves.
‘Those slaves never had the curse of unemployment
hanging over them. They 0n1y’.... Government
members (interrupting) ; ‘They only had to keep
working.’ (Prolonged laughter.)”
The slaves who toiled for bread and figs when
Greece was in her prime
Can hardly, one suspects, have had a very
gorgeous time.
Life’s simple joys were not for them; they
couldn’t go to plays,
Although some fairish stuff was staged ev n
in those distant days.
When chariot races thrilled the crowds, with
betting brisk and keen,
They couldn’t put an obol on—they never
had a bean.
Save for those helots, luckless souls, whom
Spartan lords would choose
For lushing up, to illustrate the foolishness
of booze,
They never got a sniff of wine, however
parched their throats;
And, most iniquitous of all, they hadn’t even
votes.
Yet do not rashly think their life was hard-
ship unalloyed;
At worst they always dodged the curse of
being unemployed.
The serfs who tore, with collared necks,
about the Appian Way #
Are mostly reckoned to have found existence
far from gay.
They ranked as chattels, nothing more ; they
couldn’t own a dog.
Their carcases their masters’ were, to kick or
brand or flog.
Sometimes they fed them to the fish, for
fattening or fun
(There was no “good old Pfddo” then to
rule it couldn’t be done).
Only as beasts of burden could they drag
their sweating frames
Into the mere vicinity of gladiatorial games.
Tough, you may think —-perhaps it was. Still
it must be allowed
There was a silver lining to the Latin
worker’s cloud.
This was the pull he had above the modern
wage-plug mob:
He had to hustle for a crust, but never for
a job.
The chaps had stacks of work to do, and
little enough to get,
Who drove the triremes through the waves
when Rome and Carthage met;
Chained to their oars they plugged away,
and if they dared relax
The stinging lash would curl around their
scored and straining backs.
Yet they’d one thing to cheer their hearts
and batten down the lids
Of fierce resentment, like the coves who built
the Pyramids.
Variety, attractiveness, their yacker well
might lack,
Still they could feel supremely sure they'd
never get the sack.
They feared no ganger coming round amid
the grime or slime
To ultimatum somebody to draw his blanky
time.
The galley-slave his troubles had. Withal
he never knew
At worst the crowning bitterness of having
nix to do.

“Bear be blowed!” returned the official. “He
means bare, and he’s not far out.”
“Scindiau”: Civilisation may enfold the

I-lawkes Bay Ladies’ Golf Club was the
dusky spouse of the hard-driving chieftain

duly arrived —in a bullock-dray.

“Murkah”: In the exercise of my humble
key-pounding job I was asked to take press
matter from Hobart the other
day. It concerned a baby. The
mite, left unattended a moment
or two, had crawled into a fire;
mercifully it died in a few
minutes. Next, I relieved a re-
ceiver on the Sydney trunk.
The very first item was a simi-
lar story with even more
ghastly trimmings; a pair of
babies had been burnt to death
in a Surry Hills attic. Shortly
afterwards the line “went” and
I was asked to take press from
Brisbane. I was getting nervy
by this time. Images of my
own pair of toddlers kept com-
ing before me, and I knew the
wife was busy washing. “First,”
clattered the sounder, “is a
Herald press.” It was another
baby; never mind the details.
I had just taken them down
when, “You’re wanted on the
’phone,” said a messenger. My
heart missed a beat or two, and
it was a moment before I could
hear the message clearly. It
was “Don’t forget those chops,
dear!”
“Mudros”: The flagrant waste of scrap
material in Australian industries (B.
3/11/’27) is matched by the thoughtless
waste of food in the average domestic house-
hold. Diggers who were in convalescent
camps in England when the U-boat menace
was at its height got a glimpse of how much
may be saved by careful organisation. The
highest tribute I ever heard paid to the elimi-
nation of food waste came from a pig-farmer
who was disbursing four shillings per week
for the privilege of emptying the swill-tubs
in a camp where there were 100 men. That
disgusted person threw up his contract on
the ground that he was obtaining nothing
but tea leaves!
“A. Jack”: There was no political shivoo
over the completion of the Sydney-Broken
Hill railway; all that happened was that the
railway officials
who made the final
inspection before
putting the line
into traffic had a
mug of beer and a
sandwich in the
council chamber
while they listened
to some congratula-
tory speeches. For
the first passenger
train Broken Hill
wanted to do the
thing in some sort
of style, but N. S.
Wales Labor Minis-
ters were too busy
fighting for their
political lives to
heed the appeals.
Old hands have
been making odious
comparisons by dig-
ging up records of
the opening of the
Adelaide - Broken
Hill railway. That
was done by the
Duke of Manchester
on January 12,
188 S, about 1500
adults and 800 chil-
dren standing at the
railway-station in a
shade temperature
of 112 degrees to
receive the visitors.
There was much
banqueting in the
evening. The long-
defunct Silver Age
in the same issue
wffiich reported
those proceedings
advertised the sale
of John Hill and
Co.’s Silverton - to-
Cockburn coaching
plant of five coaches
and 35 horses. The Broken Hill business of
that same firm gave up the struggle against
motor-cars only about a jrear ago.
“Kismet” : The par. about the stewards on
a Commonwealth liner who were goaded into
insurrection by “insufficient variety in their
food” (B. 27/10/’27) reminds me of an
uprising on a sister boat of which I was one
of the innocent causes. We were well on the
high seas and were staging a mock breach-of-
promise case. One of the cast was to imper-
sonate a steward whose name for the occasion
was to be Mr. Andy Tipmee. The stewards
somehow got wind of this; and a few hours
before the presentation of our farce quite an
imposing deputation arrived with an ulti-
matum. They coldly announced that we
must give an undertaking to refrain from
caricaturing their calling or they would cease
work straightway. And for the insult to
THE WAY OUT.
“Still engaged to that Hill girl, Terry.”
“No, not now!”
“Wonderful! How on earth did you get out of it!”
“Aw—just married her!”

offensive sobriquet as “Andy Tipmee” they
demanded an immediate apology. Sooner
than involve the whole of the passengers in
the penalty for our thoughtlessness we capi-
tulated.

“Sol M.”: The conscientious cablegrammer
has reported that the Australian troops in
Palestine narrowly missed capturing General
Liman von Sanders, the supreme Hun brass-
hat in those parts. The authority is the
chauffeur who conducted the headlong flight.
It is interesting, no doubt, but 11. S. Gul-
lett’s book, published in Sydney by Angus
and Robertson in 1919, also told how the
German hero fled from Nazareth with half
an inch to spare. Two nuns, whose language
was French, told an officer, whose language
was Kangaroo, that Von S. was in a house
about two yards away, but while the officer
was away finding a dictionary or something
the prey fled by the back leaving a heap of
interesting documents behind.

“Bad Australian” : Touching a recent con-
troversy about the comparative merits of
short-range firearms, the final dust-up be-
tween “Squizzy” Taylor and his erstwhile
pal Cutmore goes to show that the man who
puts his faith in the automatic pistol is
liable to be translated to Abraham’s bosom
in short order. According to press reports,
Cutmore’s gun jambed just when he wanted
it most. If the weapon had worked pro-
perly the two unexploded cartridges found
in it might have made a world of difference
to its owner.
“Murkah” : Is there any more remarkable
development of our own times than the
world news service? At 4.30 p.m. the Grey-
cliffe sank in Sydney Harbor. Inside the
hour Australia, from Gabo to Wyndham and
from the Leeuwin to Thursday Island, knew
of it, and messages of inquiry and sympathy
were humming along the wires. Along the
cables tiny currents flickered; through the
upper atmosphere the Beam sent its mysteri-
ous ray; the news was across the world,
still within the hour. At 9 p.m. a cable-
gram whipped across the earth from Scot-
land. Next came an ocean radio from the
Leviathan in mid-Atlantic: “Are you safe?”
Berlin, Paris and Home supplied one such
message each. Presently New York awoke —-
and rushed to the cable office. From Denver,
Chicago, San Francisco, Canada and Alaska
came inquiries. The stream never stopped
through the night and next day. Early last-
century news of the battle of Waterloo took
nearly seven months to meander to Port
Jackson !
“J.H.T.”: This “missing heir” industry
is largely if not mainly promoted by lying
circulars and misleading advertisements re-
presenting that there are hundreds of mil-
lions “in Chancery” awaiting claimants.
Actually, as recently pointed out by a ILK.
paper (the Glasgow Herald), the total
amount of money which Chancery holds
under this head is not even millions; it is
less than £1.500,000. This is made up of
thousands of funds. Those which exceed
£lOOO are only about 200 in number, the
majority are under £2OO and the lowest is
tenpence. There may be and doubtless is a
deal of wealth in the British Isles which
rightly belongs to people who can’t be identi-
fied, but the stories of ownerless estates in
Chancery worth millions are pure moonshine.
“Almanac”: For many years I have fre-
quented the saleyards in Victoria and have
often noticed women with infant children
standing in the sheep-pens. What attraction
they could find there has often puzzled me;
it was only lately that I got an explanation
from a married woman, an old acquaintance,
whom I found there with a baby in arms. A
long time ago, further back than her grand-
mother’s time, children with the whooping-
cough were invariably introduced to the
woollies to combat the ailment, and the tradi-
tion still persists. The belief is that the
ammonia fumes are the curative agency. Is
there anything in it?

“Skyrider”: Like most of my kind, I
listened-in on Cup day. The result of the
big race duly arrived, and feeling in neigh-
borly mood I walked across to a gang of
drain-diggers who were laying pipes opposite
my house to do what I was certain would
be regarded as a kindly action. I was stag-
gered when the ganger greeted me with “So
the South Australian horse was licked.”
“You can’t have heard the result yet,” I
came back incredulously. He pointed to a
small wireless outfit standing on a barrow.
“Heard it when you did,” lie retorted; “I
always carry that around with me. A man
must keep in touch with things.”
DAY’S END—SOUTH COAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
With “tinkle! tinkle!” back and forward
swings
A cattle-bell upon its leather strings,
While Jerseys, homing to their sheds at will,
Wend slowly up the violet-tinted hill.
Now slanting beams from day’s fast-closing
eye
With amber-colored glances flush the sky,
Kissing the old straw hat and apron blue
Of Phyllis with the rose-pearled lips of dew.
Full though her skirts, the bodice half-reveals
The prisoned beauty that her youth conceals;
Shyly she passes on day’s last employ
Thrilled by the glances of some city boy.
White as the clover on whose mat she kneels.
To stroke the Jersey’s back her soft hand
steals;
Her country shoes, stained by the roads she
treads,
Painted in patches blending browns and reds.
Blackberry hedges, bright as with smeared
blood,
Breathe pungent perfumes from their thorny
wood*
While, here and there, a berry black as jet
Still tempts a homing bird his tea to get.
Now comes a rumbling waggon home again
Through the red dust of many a winding
lane,
While Dobbin’s pace (inspired by home’s
sweet speed)
Betrays a greater zest than labor’s need.
That such is Life, that such is God I know
And am content —even were this not so,
I still would pray for such a day, and then
Pray for the chance to live it through again.

LOLA GORNALL.


“Chancery Lane”: In the Melbourne
Divorce Court recently a man whose wife
cleared out from him 30 years ago after a
few years of married life applied for a
divorce on the grounds of desertion. ’Sonah
was a little puzzled. “Why have you been
doing the Rip Van Winkle business all this
time 7” he asked. “Well,” said the petitioner,
“I’m getting old, and want someone to look
after me. I have someone in view, too.”
He got his divorce.
* *
“Pip Tok”: I have to thank my friend
Brown for a new epithet. As we were
walking along, a shabbily-dressed individual
greeted him by name. “Who’s your friend?”
I asked. “Don’t know him from a crow,” I
was informed; “he must be a tea-leaf.”
“Something I’ve run across in my cups,” he
translated, seeing that I looked puzzled.
“F.H.A.” : Struck a Queensland motorman
who had been driving his car on the new
power-alcohol manufactured at Sarina. tie
lias used all brands of petrol in the car, but
he says this stuff is rightly named, as its
power far exceeds that of the American im-
portations and it is much cleaner. But it has
a drawback —all the time it is being used there
is a distinct smell of ether, and this was so
strong at times that it made him feel queer.
I saw the car about a fortnight after the
last of the power-alcohol had been used and
the tank had been twice refilled, but there
was still a faint smell of the operating
theatre. “Eliminate this,” said the motor-
man, “and power-alcohol will have petrol
beaten to a frazzle.”

“Skyrider”: Left Canberra recently dur-
ing a wet spell, and carried away a little
of the Federal Territory with me. At the
Sydney hotel where I put up for the night
the porter carried my bags up to my room.
“How are things at Canberra?” he asked
casually. I was puzzled, for there w r ere no
labels on my luggage. He pointed to my
boots. “Can’t mistake that mud,” he said.
“I lived there for six months.” Which
seems to indicate that the new police force
will have a soft thing on when chasing
absconding Canberraites.
* * * *
“Saville Row”: Some time ago the cables
mentioned that the Prince of Wales liau
appeared in public in habiliments which in-
cluded a morning-coat of the tailed variety
and a straw hat; some horrified comments
by the editor of the Tailok and Cutteij
were appended. Last week I noted that H.R.11.
had fallen further from grace by taking the
air in a golfing get-up described by the same
eminent authority as the limit in discordant
patterns and colors. In these distressing cir-
circumstances it is no surprise to the writer
to see that a Paris paper has announced that
pressure is being brought on the Prince to
renounce the throne in favor of his more con-
ventional younger brother. It is probably
quite incorrect; still, a.straw hat may show
which way the wind blows.

“W.1.U.”: Yes, there are some casual Aus-
tralians. The most outstanding specimen I
encountered was on a railway platform. After
passing the time of day with me he pointed
to a passenger who was busy with his own
and another’s traps. “See that big blighter
there,” he said dejectedly—“he’s going away
with my wife.” The lady, I learned later,
returned after her “holiday.”
*!* ijj $ if!
“Any F.”: At a country polling booth in
the recent N.S.W. elections a lady voter
suspiciously asked the presiding officer what
he had written on the back of the ballot-
paper handed her. He explained that the
hieroglyphics were his initials and that they
had to be endorsed on the paper to validate
the vote. The lady rudely expressed her dis-
belief and her opinion that he wished to
find out how she voted. At tin; counting
after the poll had closed the officer found
it necessary to reject, among other informal
votes, a paper with a big smear of ink com-
pletely obliterating his initials. He thought
he could guess to whom that ,had belonged.
“Bad Australian”: If the account of the
discovery of the Solomon Islands written by
Lopez Vaz about the year 1597 is to be
relied on, the islands, Guadalcanal’ in par-
ticular, should repay the attention of the
prospector. According to this chronicler,
Alvarez de Mendana sailed from Callao on a
voyage of discovery, and when about 800
leagues from the coast of Peru he sighted
land. He visited 11 islands altogether. Four-
teen men sent ashore at Guadalcanar to take
in water were suddenly attacked by four
Avar canoes; their boat was seized and the
crew slaughtered to the last man. In re-
venge for this Mendana landed a strong
force and captured and burned the nearest
native village, finding a quantity of gold in
the huts. The Spaniards were unable to
ascertain where the metal came from, but
there seems to have been plenty of it, as
during their stay of 14 months in the group
they secured 40,000 pezos of gold. The pezo
de oro was worth £2 12s. 6d. at that time.

“Seno”: When I was a cable-clerk on a
Public counter during the war the worry' of
my life was the mothers who came in scores
to send a cable to their sons represented by
the Censor as being on leave at “Sans
Originie.” Often they wanted to send
money, too; and it was a difficult job to
convince that it was impossible. I averaged
20 minutes per customer in trying to explain
what the evasion meant and why it was
employed.

“Uramao”: “Lady help” has supplanted
“servant,” “boarder” has become "paying
guest,” and now “bottle-oh” and "rag-
man,” as terms applied to practitioners of
an old and honorable calling, seem in danger
of being superseded. A recent advertise-
ment in a Maoriland paper announces that
“Mr. , itinerant purchaser of dis-
carded clothing, also household utensils and
receptacles, will wait on clients” at an early
date.

“Spadassin”: Duelling, long obsolete in
most countries, is being threatened in one
of the last of its one-time strongholds, Italy.
Mussolini is, of course, responsible; his
new penal code makes entry upon “the field
of honor” a criminal offence. Now that the

OBEVS THE DICTATES
OF HER OWN HEART
AT ALL TIMES ,
But the result
IS EMBARRASSING
ESPECIALLY WHEN
Sally learns she is not
THE ONLY WOMAN IN THE WORLD,
LOVE.
“A picture-show director says that the cinema merely emphasises that Love is the
biggest factor in life, and that women should follow the dictates of their own hearts.”
passing of the Imperial regime has practi-
cally wiped out the private duel in Germany,
except the noil-lethal form indulged in by
university students, the Latin countries are
almost its last refuges. The exception, per-
haps, is Spain, where assassination, as a
means of settling differences, has always
enjoyed a superior vogue. France still re-
sorts to the rapier, and sometimes to the
pistol, but Italy, though the mother of one
of the world’s two great schools of swords-
manship, lias always shown a predilection
for the sabre, a really nasty and dangerous
implement.
* * * *
“R.S.M.”: It does a fallow’s heart good,
after seeing and hearing so much of the
utter lack of discipline of the Australian
soldier, to note that the dear old -Colonial
Office is not permitting anything of the
sort to white-ant the expeditionary force it
has raised to seek out the Malaita murderers.
A photograph forwarded by a friend in the
Solomons convinces me that nothing has
been left to chance. It depicts a squad
drawn up on the beach undergoing training
in the manual exercises, those vertebrae of
the backbone of the Army indisputably essen-
tial to the capture of romadic savages in a
country of wild and jungle-clothed moun-
tains. The picture certainly reveals faults
of detail, but only one is really serious.
While all the other members of the squad
are in shorts, one is wearing trousers (drill,
khaki, inf. pat.). This should be corrected
at once, or I fear the worst for the expedi-
tion.

“Gill" : It is claimed that wireless enabled
thousands of people on the other side of the
world to know the result of the Melbourne
Cup in a few seconds. Thousands of Aus-
tralians were less fortunate. Last year a
running description of the race was heard in
Adelaide, but the news travelled from Mel-
bourne to Adelaide per telephone line, to be
broadcast by SCL. This year, in response to
posters, crowds congregated in front .of radio
shops and in hotels and gaped up at loud-
speakers expecting to have the performance
repeated. For 20 minutes all they heard was
a horrible crackling noise. In the meantime
the result had become known by telegraph
and telephone, and the crowds gradually dis-
persed. 3LO’s wave cannot be picked up in
Adelaide during the daylight until about 5
p.m.; yet it is only 500 miles away.
* * * *
“Pip Tok”: One reason why the tucker
on outward-bound Australian transports was
of worse quality than that supplied to men
returning from the Front was that the staff
was more concerned with discipline and
deficiencies than the commissariat. Also, the
reinforcements were largely commanded by
second-lieutenants, inexperienced in the
making of complaints and too junior to have
much notice taken of them. When the
drafts arrived at the other end they were
scattered through the various training depots
of the U.K., so that any concerted action
which might have made the lot of succeed-
ing voyagers easier was practically impos-
sible. I don’t suggest that there was any
greasing of contractors’ palms in Australia,
but I do know that contractors for the
return voyages had to deal with officials who
were much more familiar with their little
ways. And the homing transports carried
more officers whose seniority would have
secured prompt attention for their com-
plaints at headquarters.

“Phil. P.” : Two hundred adventurous souls
rolled up at Hobart the other day in answer
to a call for 27 a.b.’s required to complete
the crew of the 17,000-ton Norwegian whaler
Neilson Alonso, amongst them at least a
dozen who had made one or more voyages
down south. Though the work is hard and
the conditions severe, the shipboard treat-
ment is good, and those who signed on last
year made good cheques for a four-months’
cruise, the whales taken yielding 36,800 bar-
rels of oil. The surprising feature about
the industry is that the small attendant
steamers of'7o or SO tons are able to carry
on. One of these crossed the 79th paral-
lel of latitude, and thus approached closer to
the South Pole than any other ship has done.
The Antarctic explorers have always had
specially fortified hulls for the voyage, yet
these sardine-tins can apparently do the job.
* * * *
“Sebrof”: Re petrol as an extinguisher
(B. 27/10/’27). Any motorist can safely
dip liis lighted cigarette in liis petrol-tank,
hut it must be the tobacco only that is
alight. If there are any ragged bits of
paper burning it will mean a claim on the
insurance company, if not a job for the
undertaker.
* * * *
“Patro” : There is an element of irony in
the fact that the anti-Britisli campaign in
Chicago is being conducted by a man named
Thompson, mayor of the city. There is no
more purely British name in existence. The
“son” termination marks it as genuinely
Anglo-Saxon, the attix in that form being
unknown among the Celtic folk who make
up the balance of the races inhabiting Great
Britain and Ireland. Its origin was with
the Danish and Saxon invaders, particularly
the former, who settled in great numbers
on the East Coast of Northern England and
Southern Scotland, and left it stamped in-
delibly in local nomenclature. Whatever
Chicago Thompson may consider himself
now. he was once an Anglo-Saxon, and bears
a label which proclaims the fact to whomso-
ever it may concern.
“H.V.E.”: Hunters after relics
of Ben Boyd cgn garner little now-
adays at the old Sea Inn, built by
that worthy in 1843 on the southern
shore of Twofold Bay opposite the
town of Eden. The massive Gothic
church on the hill above the hotel
is now a ruin, haunted by barn-
owls and bats. Old parson Bryce,
who afterwards acquired a station
on the Monaro plains, used to
preach at times in the Ben Boyd
sanctuary. When he was unavail-
able the service was conducted by a
layman, probably either Oswald
Brierley, the painter who super-
intended the whaling establishment,
or Ben Boyd himself. The memory
of the old pioneer is still kept green,
though few of the native Edenites
know the exact manner of his death
at the island of Guadalcanal', Solo-
mon Group. Ben Boyd landed there
one morning in 1852 from the yacht
Wanderer to shoot wild pigeons.
Two shots rang out in quick suc-
cession, and a crowd of yelling sav-
ages appeared at the mouth of a
creek in which Boyd’s boat had dis-
appeared. The rest is silence.
Si! Si= *
“Wang”: Most of these unsched-
uled train stoppages (B. 3/11/’27)
are due to the obligingness of train
crews to whom time is no object.
I know a line between a small
country centre and the main line
from Melbourne to Adelaide where
it used to be an understood thing
that the train would stop anywhere
when signalled. Residents used it
to convev messages to; their neigh-
bors or send orders to storekeepers.
One.day it pulled up near a signal-
ling homestead, and the cockie’s
wife asked the driver to take a
couple of dozen eggs to a friend in
the township. “I won’t keep you
more than a minute or two,” she
explained; “I’m just one egg short;
but the hen’s on the nest now.” A
timely cackling came from the yard
at that moment and the lady dashed
off and presently returned with a
full box. But that was before the
era of Clapp and efficiency.

“A. Jack” : Broken Hill must be
the only place in 4 Australia where
there are two official times. The
Silverton Tramway Company, the
business houses, pubs, mines, post
office (with its mail and telegraph
arrangements) and the Federal and
State Government offices work to
Adelaide time. The Commonwealth
and Government Savings Banks,
with the other banks, observe Syd-
ney time, which is half an hour
ahead. The opening of the Sydney-
Broken Hill railway, on which
Sydney time is, of course, observed,
lias led to still further complica-
tions. As far as can be ascertained,
all the parties concerned, with the
exception of the postmaster, favor
the retention of Adelaide time,
which doubtless reflects the feeling
that the major portion of the city’s
business will still go to South Aus-
tralia.

“Bucko”: My son brought home

ment of a certain cash-order fli-m.
Fifty of these, I found on inquiry.
had been supplied to every class. Surely
when some of the States are legislating
against this evil it is atrocious that it
should receive cheap publicity in this way.
“Pip Tok”: Governor Phillip, besides being
Australia’s first Governor, retains the curious
distinction of being the last Governor of a
British dependency to take the oath abjuring
the Pretender on assuming office. Five days
after his administration began the formality
had become superfluous ; Prince Charlie died
on January 31, 178 S.

May winnings come when you back the nag,

To a gracious dame, so fair to woo,
Who’ll e’en he kind to a bloke like you :
May your wife be dumb on a gilt-edged

When you meet the boys and you roll home

Whatever you’re in, and whatever about,
I breathe a prayer that you’re not found out.

“Te Babarantiko”: The brown folk of
the New Guineas and the Pacific Islands
have no better teeth than the average white
(B. 20/10/’27) ; it is merely the dusky set-
ting that makes their teeth look whiter. As
they grow older their teeth decay, like ours,
and sooner or later stumps are much in evi-
dence. Made into necklets and shoulder
festoons, I have thousands of Gilbert
Islanders’ front teeth; they are island jewel-
lery dating back to the bad old days when
men were ambushed for their boxes of
rattlers. Included are many with holes in the
centre or near the root, proving that dental
decay is itself quite an old trouble. Tahiti
has for many years had dentists doing thriv-
ing business with the natives on time-pay-
ment, cash and produce-currency basis. From
Suva dentists have for many years past made
periodical business tours through Yiti Levu
and the islands of Fiji. Queensland coastal
dentists pay profitable visits to Papua and
thereabouts; I know one who has even in-
cluded Japan in his itinerary.

“G.A.D.”: Charles may be an unlucky
name for rulers (B. 3/11/'27f, but surely
John carries even more sinister associations.
Schoolboys are taught to regard England’s
only monarch who wore that handle as a

“He’s just an impertinent, rude beast, that man!”
“Looked you over, eh?”
“No, indeed—overlooked me!”
shocking example of ineptitude and ill-luck,
.iolin I. of France reigned only a few days:
John 11. was for years a captive in England.
John of Bohemia was slain at Crecy. John
I. of Arragon was at ceaseless war with his
subjects. John 11. spent his life in warfare
with his own son. John I. of Constanti-
nople was poisoned by his eunuch; John IN',
had liis eyes put out; John VI. abdicated
and hid himself in a monastery. Pope John
I. died in prison; John VIII. was im-
prisoned by the Duke of Spoleto, and was
finally poisoned; Johns X. and XI. both
died in prison ; John XII. was deposed and
subsequently assassinated; John XXI. was
crushed to death by the fall of a house. In
fact the dismal story of luckless Johns
might bo continued indefinitely. The only
signal exception that occurs to me was John
of Portugal.

“Henry Ilorsecollar”; The report goes
abroad that British energy, with possibly
some Australian energy thrown in, will
presently begin turning the Dead Sea to
account for the sake of its chemicals. The
Dead Sea is 1300 ft. deep at the thick end
and about Oft. at the thin end, and as the
contents are 27 per cent, chemicals dissolved
in 73 per cent, water there should be money
to be made. It is also hoped that there may
be a solid deposit of valuable mixed chemi-
cals, 100 ft. thick, at the bottom, along with
the ruins of Sodom and Gomorrah, and
possibly their pickled inhabitants and the
dress bill of Lot’s wife. The shiftless Asiatic
never attempted to do anything with the
Dead Sea except some minor navigation,
mostly in the wheat-carrying line, and it has
been an uneventful place through all known
history. Still it had a slight awakening
during the Great War. Those were the days
when Lawrence, of Anglo-Irish descent, con-
trived, by solid financial and other considera-
tions, to’ unite the Arab tribes of Iledjaz as
Mohammed once did before him, and supply
Fizzle, now King of Mesopotamia, with an
army which looked imposing and made a
great noise. A scouting force of these
warriors discovered that the Turks had a
motley collection of arks-of-war at the south-
east corner of the sea, also that the owners
were all away having a meal and perhaps a
siesta. When ungodly and explosive noises
brought the Ottoman at a run he found that
the naval engagement had ended in disaster
for him, and that his enemy was gone. Then
the Dead institution relapsed into its
habitual calm.
“Adsum”; Cables have bragged lately of
an American girl typing 97 words a minute.
Over 25 years ago, using an early blind-type
machine, I managed 137 words in a minute,
130 of which were correct. The words wer*
the familiar “Now is the time for all men,”
etc. Of the more difficult test, “The quick
brown fox,” ete., where every letter in the
alphabet is used, 1 got down 95, 80 of
THE ONLY THING THAT SAVES THEM.
“A woman never gets the credit she deserves.’’
“Goodness, no, darling! Ij she did every married man would be insolvent.”
which were correct. I am confident that
there are many typists in Australia who
could top the American record.
“Bombardier B.” : It is clear enough where
the Chilian newspaper El Sub
got its account of the projected
bombing of Adelaide by a fleet
of enemy aeroplanes (B.
3/11/’27), although how the
preposterous story travelled
across the Pacific it would be
interesting to know. Wireless-
license holders in S. Aus. re-
ceived all the harrowing details
quoted by “Bad Australian” in
a so-called “wireless play”
broadcast from an Adelaide
station three or four months
ago. Indeed, they probably got
a bit more, . for the sound of
falling and exploding bombs, as
far as I remember, was included
in their issue. Our wireless
programmes are bad enough at
any time, without this sort of
senseless mischief, which evi-
dently has some travelling capa-
city, too.
“Ladybird”: I was standing
at a crowded Sydney corner the
other afternoon, waiting for my
lord and master to take me to
tea. He crossed George-street
without my seeing him, and
crept up behind me. Gripping
me by each elbow he hissed in
my ear, “Now do your worst.”
Before I could turn a burly con-
stable had butted into the game.
“What are you annoying this
lady for?” he demanded of my
husband, and continued by ask-
ing me if I had any charge to
make against the now thoroughly
shamefaced delinquent. It took
some time to convince the con-
stable that he had only wit-
nessed a conjugal joke. We have
decided to keep our little stunts
for the home circle in future.
“Basra”: My experience of the tucker on
Australian troopships was the reverse of
“Yabbie’s” (B. 27/10/’27). The wholesome
rations on the outward voyage were a wel-
come change from the eternal bread and
stew of Broadmeadows, whereas coming
home Ave fed mainly on hard steak and
doughy bread. My worst travelling experi-
ence during the war was on an Indian army
transport between Bombay and Basra, when
the Mesopotamian muddle was at its worst.
The vessel was an ancient 4000-tonner, on
which almost all the deck space was occupied
by horse and mule boxes. There were no
hammocks, and the troops slept on tables, on
horse boxes, on the awnings, in the life-
boats and even in the rigging. We fed on

“Any F.”: In a south-western township of
N. >S. Wales a new courthouse is in course of
construction, legal business being temporarily
conducted in a building that was formerly
an old church hall. An elderly drunk, who
was before the Court the other day, w r hen
asked how he pleaded, broke down and asked
for leniency on the ground that he had
learned his catechism in this identical hall
many years ago. The Bench wiped away a
sympathetic tear and made it half a crown

“Coot” : Melbourne’s original cathedral, St.
James’s, which was removed some years ago
from its site in Little Collins-street and re-
built in West Melbourne, has two balcony
pew r s, erected in the ’forties for the use of the
first Governor (Latrobe) and the Military
Commandant of the period. The baptismal
font is at least 250 years old; it was brought
from St. Katherine’s Church, London.

“Mackenz” : Speaking of home-made false
teeth (B. 25/8/’27), I know an old tin-
scratcher of the Cairns (Q.) hinterland who
is the proud possessor of a dental outfit
fashioned from the mineral which he pur-
sues for a living. The teeth are all in one
piece, but the wearer has made a groove
between each one with a file and a pocket-
knife. A local publican offered to pay for a
proper set if he were allowed to keep the
makeshift one as a curio, but the old chap re-
fused. He knew they were a bit heavy, he
added, but for old dry corn-beef there was no
beating them.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“It was resolved, by Goulburn Valley District
Methodist Synod, to protest against the legalisation
of the totalisator, against the idea of experimental
marriage and against degrading exhibitions of wrest-
ling and boxing.” — Melbourne Sdn.
Now woe, ye gamblers, who would take the
ring
With Chance, that dour unconquered heavy-
weight,
Whose short-arm jabs to such a madness
sting
As leaves you open, until soon or late
He upper-cuts you for the count of ten
’Mid whirl of stars that never were above I
Pause, punters, pause! The fight is hopeless
when
He packs a horseshoe in each loaded glove.
And woe, ye lovers, who would come to grips
With the sly godling in a vain try-out!
Ah, what a host of deadly holds he whips
Upon you; pins you early in the bout
With headlock and a scissors on the heart;
He brings you to the mat, in vain you call
On all your strength and skill —right from
the start
You’re booked, ye foolish, for a dizzy fall.
And woe, ye wrestlers, who all kindness shed
To woo Dame Fortune in your fashion
coarse!
And woe, ye bruisers, who as soon as wed
Unto your titles risk a swift divorce!
And woe—yes, woe, ye muses, when so fixed
By comprehensive parsons that you find,
In striving to keep metaphors unmixed,
You’ve left the moral of your tale behind.
VICTOBIA.
HASEN.

The steady improvement in net profits re-
flects a regular growth in the volume of
trusts administered and the expansion of the
co.’s own funds. Between the two £16,333
was netted last year, and that was 14.5 p.c.
on paid capital compared with 14.1, 13.2
12.7 and 11.4 p.c. back to 1923, all of which
gives the 9 p.c. div. a very comfortable
appearance. Over the same period share-
holders have had an average of 8.2 p.c. (= 15
p.c. to old holders), which called for only
61.7 p.c. of the total net earnings. In the
four years to Sept. ’23, the lay-by was
£14,031; in the past four years, notwith-
standing that a larger dividend has been
scattered, the lay-by has been £23,638. At
that rate of progress it won’t take long to
pile up another £50,000 with a bit over.
During the year the trusts in hand moved
up £862,559 compared with a growth of
£955,307 in the previous term :■ —

Since the close of the accounts the
£12,000,000-mark has been passed; and as
the co. takes credit for the corpus commis-
sion only as estates are wound up, the im-
provement in the figures promises well for
future profits. Trust and other earnings ar e
not separated in the accounts, but assum-
ing that the co.’s own funds are returning
an average of 6 p.c. the trust business
brought in around 7s. per cent, last year.
Exes, are climbing lustily and may continue
to do so; but thus far they have lagged a
little behind the earnings.

The market’s anticipations were realised in
June, when the board handed out a bonus of
one fully-paid for every four shares held.
That gift called for a hefty £776,975 and
made paid capital £3,884,975; visible re-
serves were drawn on for a mere trifle
(£40,000), the bulk of the sweets (£736,975)
being provided from the accumulation un-
obtrusively put away in the big cupboard
labelled “breweries, plant and machinery,
rolling stock and freehold properties, less
depreciation,” which stood in the books at
£2,548,827 a year ago. The only other gifts
in the co.’s history were during; the four
years to 1914, when a total of £887,500 was
handed out and the book value of the Kent
Brewery, was written up £350,000 without
overdoing it. The present co. paid £900,000
for the business 39 years ago. That figure
included the big George-street West freehold
(6J acres) and the brewery and plant,, then
together valued at only £186,650. Obviously
the property has been a wonderful long-
stocking, hiding some rich reserves.
The declared net profits sprang £68,856
to the record figure of £509,085, and the final
div. was lifted to 12i p.c., making 11| p.c.
for the year. Thus shareholders were gener-
ously treated, and the market got a pleasant
surprise. A 124 p.c. div. on the present
capital will call for £485,622, and except
in last year net profits have never got to
within £45,000 of that figure. The year’s
net profit was 11.2 p.c. on shareholders’
funds (capital and reserves at Sept. 30),
and they will have to earn 10.7 p.c. to
meet a 124 P-c. distribution. Unless dis-
closed earnings show further substantial
improvement the margin will have to be
cut fine to do it. There is, however, no hint
from the board that the increased rate is
not likely to be maintained. It is highly
improbable that even now the full extent of
the reserves has been disclosed; the task
before the board may not be nearly as diffi-
cult as it looks.
Now consider these figures

There has been no halt in the advance of net
profits over the past seven years, and only
once have gross profits failed to show im-
provement. The latter have expanded 91.5
p.c. since 1920; the spring last year was
£252,538 compared with £169,266 in the pre-
vious term. Exes., however, have turned in
the wrong direction, but proportionately they
are still 14 p.c. lower than in 1920. The
general improvement in the expense ratio is
a fine testimony to the quality of the man-
agement. The purchase of Castlemaine and
Wood Bros. (Newcastle) in 1920 and Mahon
(Wagga) and Lincoln (Narrandera) in 1924
has given the co. control of areas that are
yielding fine harvests, and there is no price-
cutting in the trade, which means that pro-
fits are sure to benefit from increased busi-
ness, unless, of course, exes, get out of hand.
Here is further evidence of lively trade:

Net assets . . £3,765,732 £3,908,058 £4,843,988
The writing up of the main asset obscures the
real position there. What does stand out
is an increase of £250,815 in book debts
(£1,345,797), the addition of £67,132 to
stocks (£444,677) and the strengthening of
cash and public securities (£472,171) by
£137,308; and only £43,124 was tacked on
to the trade debt, making it £491,283. The
more or less liquid surplus, including stocks,
improved £412,130 to £1,771,361: thus the
co. is well equipped to meet contingencies.
No one can be quite sure what may hap-
pen in the reaction from present-day extrava-
gance. The market, however, prices the
scrip at 425., cum Is. 3d. div. The return
to the investor at that figure is only 5.2 p.c.
on a 12|- p.c. div. basis: visible reserves
amount to 3s. 4d. per share.

There were changes on the board last year
and the new management at once set to work
to stop the financial drift, which had become
dangerous. To begin with stocks were writ-
ten down, and that resulted in a trading loss
of £12,936; there was an unexplained reduc-
tion in the book value of formula;, £29,513
was struck off plant and £14,000 off shares
in other cos. All that less £8235 brought
into the accounts left a balance of £54,214
on the wrong side of the ledger. In addition
goodwill figured in the books at £26,524;
preliminary exes, at £8689 and formulae at
£75. That is to say, £89,503 of the paid
capital (£273,205) was represented by froth
at .Tune 30. Last month shareholders agreed
to clean the slate by striking 12s. 6d. off
each of the ord. shares. Thus paid capital
is now £183,702 in 80,000 £1 A prefs. and
50,000 £1 B prefs., both lots 9 p.c. cumula-
tive with priority as to capital, and 143,205
ords. written down to 7s. 6d. each. Outside
liabilities totalled £84,934, of which £56,600
was owing to the bank and £28,334 to sundry
creditors, including provision for taxation.
To foot the bill there was £89,452 in stocks
(written back to £47,983) and book debts
and cash (£41,469). Freehold was in at
cost, £119,640; plant had a written-down
value of £44,453 —its real worth, of course,
is what it can earn—and shares in other
cos. stood at £14,304. The shares brought in
£1843 during the year.
With the accounts thus adjusted recovery
will largely depend upon the extent to which
turnover can be improved and overhead re-
duced. The factory' building, which cost
£93,000 three years ago, is still a burden
and would be a good thing to be rid of.
Efforts are being made to let portion of the
space. Last year management charges
(£54,409) ate up £8022 more than they did
in 1926, when gross trading profit was only
£60,452 compared with £73,724 in 1924.
Although the new management seems to be
going the right way about things, it has a
heavy load to lift and competition in the
co.’s lines is very keen. In addition to the
overdraft and trade debt there was £35,100
of accumulated pref. divs. owing at June 30.
That is to say, each pref. has a claim
amounting to 255. sd. for which the secu-
rity in net tangibles was 28s. 3d. After that
each ord. share, written down to 7s. 6d., was
backed by only 2s. 7d. in net tangibles.

For the first time reserves have had to be
dipped into to provide the bonus—the 10tli
successive annual event. But the habit is
working its own cure; this time the gift
has had to be reduced to one in 17—it was
one in five six years ago. A £25,000 gift
next year will mean one bonus share for
18, and, together with a 10 p.c. div., will call
for £70,000; and for three out of the past
six years net earnings have not reached that
figure. Nevertheless, as usual in such cases,
the market seems to assume that bonuses are
interminable; after business at £l2 155., cum
bonus, the £5 paid shares are offered at £l2,
at which figure the return is only a shade
better than 4 p.c. Paid capital, including
the last bonus, is £450,000 —£325,000 of it
represents capitalised profits. On the basis
of a 10 p.c. div. it will take seven gifts of
£25,000 each and one of £23,000 to'make the
scrip worth its present price to the investor
who holds his bonus shares and looks for
a 6 p.c. return.
The co. has a very strong connection and
a discerning management, and the business
lias grown steadily. Here is one view of
the expansion:—

In comparison with other underwriters the
co. has been fortunate in its loss experiences,
but last year’s gain in that respect was
heavily offset by a sudden spring in the
expense ratio, which mounted to 51.3 p.c.,
the second tallest figure in the co’s history.
Taxation was mainly responsible for the
increase. Including £4OOO put in the cup-
board to meet the next bill, no less than
£31,772 was eaten up in taxes of one kind
and another, compared with £20,326 in 1020.
Tne net result was an underwriting profit of
7.9 p.c. compared with 7.3, 16.6. 12.7, 14.2.
9.1, 18.1 and 21.8 p.c. back to 1920.
Revenue from the two sources has borne the
following varying proportions :
Underwriting. Interest, etc.
1920 .. .. £62,793 £28,113
1922 .. .. 23,777 35,085

1926 . . . . 21,684 44.637
1927 . . . . 20,119 46,630
The return from investments is still more
than sufficient to meet the 10 p.c. div., but
last year’s underwriting results will have
to greatly improve if the current year’s
profits are to provide another gift of
£25,000.
Funds nearly three times greater than
last year’s net premium income give policy-
holders a wide margin of protection, and in
addition they have the comfort of knowing
that shareholders can be called upon to
dredge up another £5 on each ; of 90,000
shares should the worst happen. Inciden-
tally, the protection there increases with
each capitalisation. And there is nothing to
trouble about in the assets either. They aro
a solid lot; 69.6 p.c. (£674,641) of th?
total is represented by Government securi-
ties and deposits. Premises are in at
£103,691, and worth a lot more; £103,041
is out on mortgage, and to meet liabilities
totalling £79,238, including provision for
unadjusted losses, there was £86,758 in bonk
debts, cash and accrued interest.

The shares are now all held by the Vic.
Chamber of Manufactures, which bought the
last of the individual holdings three year,
ago. In its 13 years of underwriting theco.
has paid a regular 10 p.c. div., handed back
to policy-holders £262,140 in rebates of from
30 p.c. to 10 p.c. and dropped £62,45S of its
profits into the coffers of the Chamber, which
it lias also provided with a fine city home,
in the books at £98,132 and worth a lot more.
In addition it has built up reserves which
with paid capital amount to 155.7 p.c. of
last year’s net premium' income—about 150
p.c. is the figure usually. strived for —and
the £66,978 set aside to cover unexpired risks
was £18,268 in excess of the 40 p.c. generally
accepted as safe.

Members’ loyalty to the co. is reflected in
the exceptionally low expense rate; and the
loss ratio is below the general average, too.
In addition to the property item policy-
holders have the protection of £196.087 in

THE GOLD-BRICK KINGS.
“The celebrations at Moscow of the tenth anniversary of the revolution were accompanied by excited scenes. When Trotsky and Kareneff. who were recently
expelled from the Communist party, attempted to address the crowds, troops had to be called out to suppress wild disorder. Zinovieff attempted to speak at Lenin-
grad, but was howled down. Trotsky managed to get a hearing at an aviation factory. He declared that the festivities were completely out of place in view ol tne
economic situation of the Soviet.”

Shareholders in the Daily Telegraph
and Sun newspaper cos. have agreed to the
scheme whereby the Sun becomes interested
in the former publication —indeed takes con-
trol of it. Two new cos. will be formed, a
holding co. and a working co. The present
Daily Telegraph Co. will be taken over
by the holding co., and the whole of the
newspaper assets sold to the Daily Tele-
graph Pictorial, Ltd., the working co.,
which will have a nominal capital of
£500,000. In this co. the Sun will hold 52
shares for every 48 held by the Telegraph
Holding Co. For assets transferred the lat-
ter will receive 106,680 7 p.c. cum prefs. and
115,557 ords., including 77,000 ords. for
goodwill. The Sun, which is to sell to the
holding co. its right to publish morning
newspapers in Sydney, gets 73,581 ords. for
goodwill, and will immediately take up and
pay for 50,000 shares. Thus the working
co. starts with a paid capital of £345,818,
to be increased by an unspecified amount to
be subscribed jjy the Sun and the holding
co. as additional working capital. Present
Daily Telegraph holders will receive 12s.
6d. per old share in scrip in the new co., and
an unspecified cash payment out of the
£305,000 for which the old co. recently sold
its building. The last of that money, by
the way, is not payable until three years
after the premises are handed over. Scrip
in the old co. had a net tangible backing
of 20s. lOd. per share at Dec. 31, 1926; pro-
ceeds from the sale of the building and
scrip in the new co; (at par) will together
equal 295. Bd. per old share. On the market
the old shares recently changed hands at

“Roman": The Queensland Government
proposes to amend its Petroleum Act 1923
with a view to increasing the ai’ea that may
be held under a permit. At present 10,000
acres may be tied up for 12 months, during
which time the applicant must diligently
prospect for petroleum. Within the 12
months he must place an adequate drilling
plant on the ground, and within two years
from the date of the permit he must drill
at least one hole to 2000 ft. These periods are
too long, and already they have acted bane-
fully upon this young industry by locking
up nearly one million acres in 115 applica-
tions. Up to last week 102 permits had been
granted; practically all the land within a
radius of 30 miles from the Roma bore is in
the hands of “shepherds” and speculators.
The furthest point north of Roma is about
38 miles, west 15, east 28, and south 24
miles. The history of petroleum mining
proves that oilfields and oil-pools cover very
limited areas. If one of them exceeds three
square miles in surface area it is an out-
size in oilfields. Kern River oilfield, the
largest in the rich Bakersfield region, is
about three miles long by three miles wide.
Coalinga, Maricopa, Lost Hills, Devil’s Den,
Taft. Sunset Midway and McKittrick do
not exceed two miles square. The new fields
around Los Angeles have hundreds of der-
ricks side by side for perhaps a mile or two.
Therefore why allot 10,000 acres or 15 sq.
miles to every permit-holder? The rent , of
a permit per acre is too low and the royalty
of 121 per cent, on the r/ross oil proceeds is
too high. The permittee can make too free
with private property because the Act allows
him free entry and exit to a man’s farm,
orchard, back yard or sheep-station, and
when there he can take wood and water,
make roads, erect buildings and do what he
blinking well pleases. Section 26, giving
the Minister of Mines plenary power to
cancel permits, is too arbitrary and there-
fore dangerous.

“Catalist”; The position at Roma to-day
is practically no different from what it was
when the first bore was opened 21 years ago.
Certainly there is now more of the lighter
fractions of petroleum condensing from the
gas, simply because the gas is coming up at
a lower temperature than it did 21 years
ago when these fractions were vaporised and
came up as gas. There is no evidence what-
ever, geologically or chemically, that a pool
or lake exists immediately below the present
bore. The petroleum running from the
bore intermittently is merely a condensate —
condensed from the gas in the cool upper
portion of the bore. Yet in face of this simple
phenomenon, the propaganda that is being
carried on suggests that the elusive oil lias
at last been struck. At Longreacli there is
inspissated petroleum —tarry material in
sandy formation. At Roma there is the
other end of the petroleum chain —the ben-
zine and kerosene fractions. But where the
intermediate oil fraction is no one can in-
dicate. Certainly it is not at Roma as
adjudged on present evidence and previous
borings. Again, the Roma gas is a dry gas
containing only li pints of petrol per 1000
cubic feet of gas. Prospective investors or
gamblers should not buy Rolls Royee cars
on the strength of this quantity of petrol,
for it is highly improbable that it would
pay to extract.
Queensland's gold output for October was
44060 z. worth £15,715, compared with
llOOoz. worth £4673 for October, 1926.
This brings the total gold return for the
first 10 months of 1927 to 23,6460 z. valued
at £100,441, as against 73090 z. worth
£31,045. But Mount Morgan’s contribution
to the October return this year was 35720 z.;
it produced nothing in the previous year and,
as it is now merely cleaning up, it isn’t
likely to produce much, if anything, next
year - . The rest of the Queensland shows
gave 5340 z. for the month. It is enough to
make a brazen image sniffle.
From Tennant’s Creek (N.T.) comes
news of a find of gold on the Homeward
Bound, over which the Mid-Australian Ex-
ploration Co., of Adelaide, holds an option.
The latter co. has a capital of £lO,OOO in
1000 £lO shares, of which promoters took
150. Smith Roberts, the manager, sank a
shaft 31ft. in a big ironstone formation with
no defined walls, and he will sink to 50ft.
and crosscut to the lode. There was ore
down to 20ft., and four samples assayed at
Adelaide School of Mines gave 30oz. lldwt.
gold and 7.9 p.c. bismuth, 30oz. sdwt. gold
and 6.3 p.c. bismuth, 13oz. 9dwt. gold
and 6.8 p.c. bismuth, and 520 z. 18dwt.
gold and 13.9 p.c. bismuth. At 25ft.
the lode was sft. wide. Other assays
have given 13oz. 7dwt. gold, lloz. 13dwt.
gold, 9oz. ldwt. gold and _2780z. gold,
with an average of 3f p.c. of bismuth. This
last rich sample was taken across the shaft
from west to east. But the wise man takes
gold assays cautiously, unless there is a
guarantee of bulk sampling, and that is not
suggested in this case. Smith Roberts
speaks guardedly of the sliowq as he does not
expect to get into settled country till 80ft.
down. The property is the centre of a belt
of mineral country 15 to 25 miles wide. A
plan of the field shows that 27 leases have
been pegged.
Some time ago The Bulletin announced
that a Sydney mining group, headed by
Rundell Miles, had taken an option over
some dredging leases held by Guinea Gold on
the lower Bulolo River. These, referred to
as N.G. South and Central, are below the
original holding of Guinea Gold which that
co. is working. Following on the option,
Tom Horton, A. W. Freeman’s old partner
and one of the syndicate from which
sprang Austral Malay, was sent up to test
the ground. Details of his findings are not
very definite, but the general effect of his
report is satisfactory, and the option is to
be exercised. Rundell Miles, who has been
conferring with the Guinea Gold directorate
in Adelaide, where that co. was born, has
returned to Sydney, and the formation of a
co. to work the properties is imminent.
Terms will probably be announced by the
end of the month, and will have some
interest for Guinea Gold shareholders, who
are in the position of vendors.

Federation Tin Mines, Ltd. (Tas.), is a
London co. whose consulting engineer, A.
W. Hooke, has just spent six months on the
mine at South Heemskirk. He corroborates
the estimate of .T. B. Lewis, the Tasmanian
expert, of 10.000,000 tons of ore. Milling
should begin early in the new year, and the
first unit can put through 200 tons a day.
This works out, on assays, at 2ji6 tons of
metallic tin a year, worth, at £250 per ton,
£66,600. There are also some alluvial
deposits on the property which may help.
The directors have assured the shareholders
they can provide all the capital necessary
to carry the mine to the producing stage.

London may be asked shortly for funds
to help the further developmenft of the
Yuanmi district on the Murchison goldfield
(W.A.). An English co. left a lot of un-
developed ore in a mine there because share-
holders refused to find further capital, and
an appeal to the State Government for
financial help was fruitless. Subsequently
an American stranger induced a Perth syn-
dicate to back a concentration process which
he said would again put Yuanmi on the
map; but, after a few thousands had been
spent, operations ceased. The people now
about to pass round the hat are said to have
some kind of a gold-finder “which has never
yet been known to fail.”

Some people who claim to have the inter-
ests of Westralian mining at heart propose
to shortly ask the Government to (1) repeal
the dividend tax, which is being collected
from only one co., the South Kalgurli, at
present; (2) to abolish all taxation on back-
ers of prospectors; (3) to do away with
taxation on incomes derived from mining;
(4) to request that an Act be passed by
the British Parliament to exempt from taxa-
tion all incomes derived by residents of the
United Kingdom from profits from Austra-
lian mining enterprises; and (5) to stir the
Commonwealth Government up in regard
to a bonus on gold production. Anyhow, you
can’t accuse Lazarus of being modest about
the extent and horribleness of his sores.

Boulder No. 1 lias told its shareholders
over and over again that the block it sur-
rendered was worth nothing, yet a local
syndicate of mining men which began where
the co. left off has taken out several good
crusliings, and now claims to have 8000 tons
of 50s. ore in sight as well as good prospects
at depth. Having missed this, the co. now pro-
fesses to be looking for another good thing,
but prospectors and claimholders allege that
it is disinclined to pay a reasonable price
for anything promising. It has missed more
than once because of this.

White Hope, Hampton Plains (W.A.),
looks hopeless. This is the show which
Herbert Daly declared during the 1920-21
boom to be one of nature’s great goldmines
and which was regarded for a time as a
second Great Boulder. Shares rose in a
few months from a few shillings to £4 10s.
and were freely tipped to go to £lO. From
the start this page believed the shoots were
short, and when that was proved a slump fol-
lowed. A syndicate of Adelaide and Kal-
goorlie mining men worked the property
after the White Hope Co. gave up, and
extracted, it is said, about 1.0,0000 z. but
made very little profit. None of the adjacent
leases ever paid.

Attempts to revive the old Lady Shenton
(W.A.) are not meeting with the luck an-
ticipated. Values are erratic at depth and
faults frequent. This is one of the Menzies
shows that produced a lot of gold during
the height of the Coolgardie boom and then
gradually got below pay mark. Several
attempts have since been made to give it a
new lease of life, but none have succeeded.

“Peter”: Developmental work in Wiluna
Gold Mines has exposed so much ore of
an average gold content of 40s. that no
doubt need be entertained regarding the
volume of material likely to be available
for treatment. What would be welcome would
be a statement to the effect that a satis-
factory gold extraction can be obtained from
the ore in bulk. Similarly, a description of
the treatment process proposed to be used
would be acceptable to many who still enter-
tain doubts as to the successful treatment of
the ore.

In view of recent movements in Malayan
tin, some comments by the London Mining
Journal are worth the attention of inves-
tors- —-not to mention punters. Tin dredgers
have proved a very valuable source of
revenue to the F.M.S. Government. But
that Government has to consider other
aspects of administration; it has to look
after the interests of a great native popula-
tion which mostly lives by agriculture; and
to these the question of water-supply is all
important. Of late the Government of the
F.M.S. has been seriously concerned over the
silting up of the rivers upon which so many
of the tin-dredging cos. have been working
—some of them for many years. Not only
has this silting affected irrigation, but in
some places it has seriously threatened the
free drainage of a country which, in spite
of its dry spells, periodically needs all the
drainage it can get. The Government be-
lieves that the dredges have been largely
responsible for the silting trouble. This is,
naturally, denied by the dredging cos.; never -
theless, the Government is now considering
the drafting of regulations under which dredg-
ing cos. will not be permitted to operate in
rivers, or within a certain distance from
their banks. What this would mean to many
dredging cos. needs no elaboration. Many
of them would lose valuable areas, and the
whole system of Malayan tin dredging,
which is largely based on water supply from
an adjacent river, and in many cases on
dredging in the stream beds themselves, would
have to be readjusted. The cos. are asking
for a Commission to go into all aspects of
the matter: and until the question has been
finally determined, the future of more than
one Malayan tin stock must remain uncer-
tain.
* :I: * *
The advent of the monsoon season in
Malaya is always a source of trouble to
dredging concerns, and already this season
has had its casualties. Nawng Pet, the big
Siamese sluicing show, has reported a stop-
page of operations for some days, as a
result of heavy falls in some of the faces,
due to saturation. The Pet has had a heap
of trouble with floods and washouts, some
of which have buried good ground in rub-
bish. The last flooding was in January,
and though precautions and safeguards in
the way of dams minimised the trouble som-'>-
ivhat, another expensive delay was caused.
Ratrut Basin’s new show at Siehon is
another sufferer. Siehon is on the east coast
of Siam, and now deliveries of heavy machine
parts at the port are impossible. This means
that the big new Sydney-built dredge, which
it was hoped would be running next October,
will not be able to start digging till some
months after that date. Much of the material
is already at Sichon, but it is not expected
that deliveries can begin again until Febru-
ary next. However, the old dredge from tin-
original property is in course of assemblage,
and this job will be pushed on as fast as pos-
sible.
* * * *
Nwang Pet, a big sluicing show in the
Ronpibon district (F.M.S.), has had an
unlucky year, for though recoveries were
high, so were expenses and working costs.
The ground treated during the year to March
31 showed a return of 1.761 b., worth
£17,000. Working exes, came to £14,218,
office costs to £49SI. Depreciation and other
charges of the kind got away with £7381,
and with the addition of small incidental
costs the loss for the year totalled up to
£9639. The mine has been singularly unfor-
tunate with regard to floods. One of these
in November, 1925, played up with the dams
and plant, besides washing down debris that
had to bo cleared out, this job lasting until
the following January. Another flood occurred
in January this year, and once more
work was seriously impeded. The plant, too,
is antiquated, but the installation of the
new hydro-electric scheme, for which addi-
tional capital was raised, should revolu-
tionise matters. The report showed that on
March 31 the co. had borrowed £5833 and
owed to sundry creditors £5027.

Alluvial Tin has circularised shareholders
announcing the holding of an extraordinary
general meeting to be held at the company’s
registered office at Rawang (F.M.S.) on
Friday, November 18. Proxy forms have
been issued to Australian shareholders. The
meeting will deal with the proposal to sell
A.T.’s Malayan holdings to an English co.
on terms already reported. The A.T. direc-
tors, in asking for confirmation of their
provisional deal, add that, under the agree-
ment as made by them, they will transfer
their services to the new organisation, and
financially co-operate with the purchasers.

JAMES O. FAIRFAX, knight and bar-
rister-at-law, one of the two senior
proprietors of the S. M. Herald, who
might have had to go to gaol if the
new Government had not refused to
go on with the late Government’s
stupid prosecution of the paper for
criminal libel.
William Morris Hughes has scored a new
distinction ; he is a participant in an “Ugly
Man’s Competition” in Sydney which has a
charitable objective. Most of the candidates
have photographs taken by the distortograph
camera; Hughes’s particular style of beauty
needs no artificial exaggeration. He has no
delusion on the subject. Once, told by
Atlee Hunt that a new portrait didn’t do
him justice, he exclaimed: “My face doesn't
want justice—it wants mercy,
Victoria’s Rhodes Scholar for 1928 is
Andrew Garran, son of Knight Robert and
grandson of that other Andrew who used
to be editor of the S. M. Heraed. Just
21, he is in his third year arts after
brilliant successes in his lirst and second
years. He represented Melbourne against
the English debaters last year, and was one
of the members of the University team which
won the last inter-’Varsity debates in Adel-
aide. Young Garran has represented his
college in cricket, tennis and football.
News was received from Scotland the
other day of the death of Stewart Leisliman,
who. with his brother Harry, was prominent
in Queensland in the ’eighties and 'nineties.
The brothers, after
the usual bout of
“colonial experi-
e n c e,” acquired
Lome station on
the Upper Barcoo
and held it for
years. Their wool-
shed was burnt by
a band of shearers
from the Blackall
camp during the
great strike of
1891. After his
brother dropped
out Stewart car-
ried on, but event-
ually became man-
ager of the Wien-
liolt Estates in
Southern Queens-
land. His wife, a
noted Queensland
beauty of her day,
survives him.
G. A. GIBBS,
Secretary of the
Melbourne
Metropolitan
Board of Works.
Alfred Macartney Hemsley, one of the
five new M’s.L.C. appointed by the N.SAV.
Government, did not become interested in,
politics until the war revealed tendencies
which he considered needed combating.
Since then he has been on the council of
the Nationalist Association. The tall lawyer,
now 67, owes his years to Australia. Forty
years ago he fled from the chill and fog of
the Old Land. He left a legal partnership
to link with the Allens in the Sydney
firm of Allen, Allen and Hemsley. Hemsley
was a first-grade cricketer, and his Ann
supplied the I. Zingari team in its sparkling
days with four good men.
Malcolm Newman, the mining engineer
whose clear head and boundless energy have
been mainly responsible for what is known
as “the Pratten stable” selling a handful of
Malayan tin properties to London for
£500,000 cash and £250,000 in shares, is a
backblock Queenslander who got to Sydney
30 years ago, mostly on scholarships, and
went through the Uni. mining school. Soon,
on account of the way he led the field at
examinations, he was nicknamed after, a bril-
liant chestnut of the period. But brilliant
students weren’t as well looked after in those
days as they are now, and both Newman and
his also-brilliant friend Jensen, now the
well-known Queensland geologist, had a
tough struggle before they were through.
The friends were utterly unlike in one
respect. Malcolm Newman, a typical “rid”
Austral-Scot, was intensely practical; Jen-
sen thinks himself well paid if he can do
something for science and the world-in-gen-
eral. After getting his underground experi-
ence at Broken Hill Newman went to West-
ralia, but for nearly 20 years past he has
been mostly interested in tin—diving off on
to a farm in Queensland for his long periods
of recreation.
Charlie Lyons, of Essendon (Vic.), is not
sure of his age, but on rough reckoning is
well over 110. Though not a native, he has
been in Australia since he was 20 years old.
He is still able to do a three- or four-mile
walk, and now and again toddles off to Mel-
bourne hospital to let the doctors have a
look at him.
It is many years since a Judge of the S.
Aus. Supreme Court has been addressed in
open court as “ ’Sonah” by his own son.
With the present Bench, it is quite likely
that the occurrence will become common-
place. Piper, the newly-appointed Judge,
left his practice in the hands of two of his
sons, who frequently appear in civil cases,
while Angas Parsons has two of his offspring
studying law —one in Adelaide, the other at
Cambridge. Napier, the youngest occupant
of the Bench, has two boys ready to go on
to the ’Varsity, and one of them is expected
to make use of his dad’s old textbooks.
Boyce, just retired from control of \m.
Tourist Bureau, worked up the show from a
revenue producer of £BO,OOO a year in 1908-
09 to half a million at present. And he did
more ; he awakened Australians to a better
appreciation of their own land. He is going
to the Cold Country with the Caledonian pil-
grims. The Big Australian is only a lialf-
Scot, but he should be a valuable honorary
envoy.
Frank Tate, Director of Education; .
Cattanach, Chairman of the Water Com-
mission, and A. M. Laughton, Government
Statist, three of Vic.’s senior public
officers, have returned from abroad, much to
the relief of the Labor Government, which
was getting fidgety about heads being away.
But that doesn’t imply that a Minister may
not go to London during the Parliamentary
recess to reorganise the Agency-General—
or something else.
The Scots’ College, Sydney, is getting for
its vice-principal in the New Year a distin-
guished soldier in W. R. McNicoll. He
was head of Geelong High School (Vic.)
when the European unpleasantness started,
and enlisted as soon as it was decided that
Australia would be there. He was then a
major of militia, and he went away second
in command of the 6th Battalion. He was
on Gallipoli, was seriously wounded, spent,
five months in hospital, was invalided home,
but was back again within a few months and
took part in nearly every battle in his
sector, gaining wounds, decorations and the
command of the 10th Brigade. M hen lie
went to Goulburn (N.S.W.) it was to com-
mence the organisation of the P.L.C. He
has managed the school so well that not only
s it one of the show places of Goulburn,
hut the Kirk has now no need to worry about
bawbees for its upkeep.
Greville Purdue, just promoted head of
the Westralian C.I.D. after 23 years’ ser-
vice, was born qt Ballarat (Vic.) 52 years
ago. He was in command of the small
force which worked for months accumu-
lating the mass of evidence that brought
Coulter and Treffene, the W.A. goldfields
murderers, to the gallows. The most inter-
esting part of Purdue’s career was the period
he spent abroad as a member of the A.E.F.
Intelligence Branch, but the public is not
likely to hear any details of that work.
Tom Hayes, Labor member for Melbourne,
has been made grand-president of Vic. Hiber-
nian Friendly Society. Like fellow-worker
Lemmon, Minister for Education, who is one
of the pillars of the A.N.A., Hayes is inter-
ested in the business side of friendly-society
work. Next year he will lead a contingent
from his organisation to Sydney to attend
the Eucharistic Congress and celebrations.
John Shore, the Speck’s oldest inhabitant,
has taken the Long Road at 105. He was
not a native son, having come from England
in the early ’fifties. The voyage occupied
seven months, and the craft caught fire and
was blown up near De Witt Island. The
passengers and crew reached the Speck in
open boats. Until 20 years ago Shore pro-
spected for tin and gold in all parts of the
island. The old fellow used to chuckle over
the incident of a flapper of 90 who threat-
ened him with breach of promise.
Almost half a century ago Robert Charles
Reed built his home in the bush on one of
the most picturesque spots on Sydney’s fore-
shores. And it was from the old home, added
to and modernised through the years, that
his funeral moved the other day. For the
whole of his working life Reed had been asso-
ciated with the mercantile and shipping firm
of Gibbs, Bright and Co., climbing to a
partnership in the Australian business.
Sixty years’ service in the diocese of Nel-
son in the Shaky Isles was the record put up
by Charles Oliver Mules, who died recently.
A Cold Country product, he arrived in
Maoriland in 1867. worked as a journeyman
sinshifter until 1892, when the Nelson
crozier was placed in his hand. In 1912 he
relinquished it, and for the past 15 years had
lived in retirement near the scene of his
old job. He was in his ninety-first year
Avlien Death called.
Marc Fink, octogenarian brother of Theo-
dore, of Melb. Herald and other cos., has
passed out. Adventure had more attraction
for Marc Fink than the quest for wealth,
although he did not miss the latter. In his
youth he assisted his dad in farming in
Western Vic. He took part in the Hokitika
(M.L.) gold rush, had a look-in at Port
Darwin auriferous areas and was among the
diggers at Mount Browne. A good sport,
he could ride, box, swim and angle with the
best of amateurs in his day.
Denis Bourke, an employee of John Sands,
the printing firm that lias grown with Syd-
ney, was congratulated the other _ day on
having completed 60 years of service with
the firm. Chief point of his reply was that
he regarded himse\f as a mere lad and
hadn’t even considered the matter of retir-
ing. Bourke joined as a boy; lie is now in
charge of a department. The firm has a
habit of keeping its employees —50 of the
members of the staff present when tlieir
oldest inhabitant was handed a presenta-
tion could boast of over 25 years’ service.
The American woman evangelist who kid-
napped herself and dragged herself by the
scrulf of her neck across the Mexican border
and threw herself into a lonely shack has
had the inevitable imitator. A Pentecostal
preacher ivas found the other day on a lonely
road in Gippsland (Vic.) tarred and with
his wrists bound with barbed-wire. Dis-
believing people queried the story, and the
young religious enthusiast under pressure
admitted that it was not 100 per cent, truth
and innocence. Enthusiasm of this descrip-
tion should be discouraged.
.T. T. Mathewson, of Brisbane, who was
thought to have been murdered in China
in. August, has turned up at Darjee-
ling, India. Although Australia’s hobby
is sport, it has supplied a percentage
of missionaries in hazardous places
quite out of proportion to its population.
Mathewson. is one of the small army
which has taken to the work, lie was born
30 years ago in Brisbane, where his father
is well known. When he went to China four
years ago he chose an inland post. And
at the height of the recent —and present-
wars, when the missionaries were ordered to
leave, he decided, with two others, to go
across Tibet to India rather than down the
Yellow River.
A. J. Hannan, who leaves for England to
represent the S. Aus. Government against
the Armstrong-Whitworth people—they are
claiming half a million or so over a matter
of a railway order —stepped into the position
of Crown Solicitor when Dr. Richards was
appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court.
Fifteen years ago Hannan joined the Crown
Law staff as a junior member, and lias
reached the top while still on the right
side of 40. He dissipates his surplus
energy rowing and lacrosse-playing, with lec-
turing at the Law School as a mild relief.
Jack Carroll, V.C., recently had a brush
with a sawmill at Yarloop (W.A.) and he
emerged minus a foot. Carroll thought that
the V.C.’.s privilege of turning out the guard
at the Horse Guards was a merry jest.
Another Australian cross-holder was a whale
on that joke. He would visit the pubs in
the by-ways of London and, having got
the ear of a mob, would invite them to
see him turn out the guard. On the urgent
request of the War Office that hero was
pushed back to France in a hurry. Carroll
took a lot of persuading to turn up for his
investiture. After he had missed three dates
he was almost placed under arrest that he
might be there when George R. had got the
pin-cushion ready for the fourth time.
Stuart Stephenson, lately appointed head-
master of the Brisbane Grammar School in
succession to W. Burfield, had a brilliant
scholastic career. Educated at Oxford, he
won an open mathematical scholarship and
took his B.A. with honors in maths, in 1889.
In 1890 lie came to Australia. He was
resident and senior mathematical master at
BALL, N.B.W. Minister for Lands, one of
the old hands of the new Ministry.
Wesley College, Melbourne, and second mas-
ter at Prince Albert College, Auckland
(M.L.) and subsequently principal there. In
1909 he was appointed second master at
Brisbane Grammar. His move to the top
position will win a cheer from the school's
old boys.
SNIP-SNAP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The unconventional and sometimes rather loud
dress of the Prince of Wales has given occasion for
two disapproving articles in- the Tailor and Cutter.”
It’s up to you, Teddy the next,
To take a sartorial pull.
Your methods of dress
Occasion distress,
They’re like a red rag to a bull
In the eyes of those pundits inspired
Their dicta so often to utter
How the great ones of earth should be
garbed and attired- —
The Oracles spruce
Of the scissors and goose,
The narks of the Tailor and Cutter.
There are plenty to fault you, be sure,
For merely being gallant and gay,
Wild men from the Clyde
To chip and to chide
When the estimates get under way.
Your penchant for risking your neck
Makes wowsers resentfully mutter;
And your urge in the gladdest of rags to
bedeck
Your debonair frame
Isn’t playing the game
By the code of the Tailor and Cutter.
There are lots wouldn’t worry a hang
In what pattern of pants you might dress
If: you’d only convert
Some trim bit of skirt
Into an engaging princess.
But the knicks and the stockings you wear
When using a deck or a putter
Suggest a complete disregard for the fair,
If I have a grip
On the snap of the snip
Who edits the Tailor and Cutter.
Aye, fierce is the light on a throne;
A prince cannot dress as he like;
Whatever he wear,
’Tis safe to declare,
Will give some observer the spike.
Time was when Olympian ire
Set toughest of mortals a-flutter,
But they never hurled bolts at distasteful
attire,
Like the gods who wax wroth
’Mid the bolts of their cloth,
The gods of the Tailor and Cutter.

“P.C.1.”: I was lieutenant to “Professor”
McGillivray (not MeGilvary) for some years
and can amplify “Condrew’s” remarks (B.
29/9/’27). Mac operated in a yard 21ft. in
diameter. A glance at a horse’s head enabled
him instantly to gauge its nature. He had
eight methods of catching horses, and con-
sidered he was loafing on the job if he
failed to mount a nag, without tackling of
RABBITS AND ROMANCE.
“Isn’t it 'a lovely ring, darling?”
“Not too bad —but I ’ope th’ price o’ rabbit-skins keeps up till I finish payin’ for it.”
any description, in 2A or 3 minutes. At
Moree (N.S.W.) he was once “clocked” to
catch and mount a colt in eight seconds.
When catching a colt lie never “patted” it.
He explained that when a mare caressed her
foal she licked it. and he followed nature
by stroking, which the animal understood.
Nor did he “jerk” the horse to a halt when
catching it; he threw his weight on the
crest of its neck and kept it moving. The
effect was the same as pressing finger and
thumb into a man’s neck.
“Waif”: I happen to be staying at Nice.
Tiie Bulletin has followed me there from
Majorca and Marseilles, thanks to well-con-
ducted Spanish and French post offices. Thus
it is I know that an Abo. seer has prescribed
as a cure for jibbing in horses a sham of
extracting non-existent stones from the
prads’ hooves. This information led me to
court fame in the busiest part of the busiest
street in Nice at the busiest hour one Satur-
day morning. Several men tried to get a
young horse to move an empty cart oft' the
particular area. When everyone was satis-
fied that nothing more could be done I took
some handy road metal and started in on the
stone-extraction game, going round each toot-
sie and tapping it with fatherly care. I
added a trick of my own. I gave him some
small stones to stand on with two feet while
I tapped the others. Then I told the grocer
to get along home, and he hopped into the
cart and drove off. The French crowd was
very decent; I might have been the Ford
High Yet-, instead of an interfering stranger.
* * h= *
“Wandi”: Binghi wins admiration when
he is up a tree chopping out a ’possum or
a bees’ nest. He uses a scrub vine, from
Ain. to fin. thick, one end of which is
looped. This end he holds in one hand;
the other end, when he is chopping toeholds
on the way up, is held behind the knee by
doubling up the leg. To save unnecessary
labor, he locates the exact position of the
’possum by tapping before chopping a hole
in the trunk of the tree. If he lias to work
below limbs, the two ends of the vine are
tied together, and he leans back with nearly
his whole weight on it, perhaps a hundred
feet from the ground. As he climbs stark
naked, he is particularly interesting when
taking a sugar-bag, clinging like a giant
black spider to the branchless bole, with a
thousand bees buzzing about him.
* *1: ❖ X
“Mudros”: At the recent Adelaide Show
some of my neighbors were discussing bees
and how to prevent them from inflicting
bodily harm. There was nothing new in the
methods of Bert and Dave, but dad’s struck
me as original. “I always scrape the sweat
orf a sow’s belly,” he drawled, “and rub ; t
well inter me face and arms and the back
o’ me neck. I’ve ’andled ’em all me life and
never ’ad a sting. Bees’ll never tackle a
pig,” he added; “they know it ’ud spoil the
’oney.”
* $ * *
“Black Tracker”: Do birds patch up or
try to mend a broken or injured limb? Ex-
amining a native companion that had fallen
to my gun, I found it had a crooked leg that
showed signs of a recent injury. On the affected
part was plastered what appeared to be a
mixture of earth and dried blood. Whether
it got there owing to the bird squatting in
the mud or was put there designedly I
could not determine. There was no trace of
a plaster on the sound leg. An old black-
fellow later on told me that the birds had
taught his people how to mend broken limbs.

mounting their horses. The covers kept the
feet warm; without them the toes became
painfully numbed. The men had various
names for them, including overalls and boot-
gloves, but the boss called them bush-spats.
Some of the men also wore a sock on the
bridle hand, pocketing the other hand. I
tried that trick one freezing morning, but
after the colt had dropped me on my head
in a gilgai hole, through my not having free
fingers on the bridle hand and getting the
other one stuck in a pocket, I discarded it.

“Topee”: Now that the station-owner
provides the cook, that exciting function
the election of a shearers’ chef
will disappear from pastoral
life. In the Riverina 45 years
ago there might be as many as
a score of candidates for the
office. As ration charges were
heavy it required great experi-
ence on the cook’s part to
satisfy the barbers and keep the
weekly bill down to about 12s.
per head, which included his
own 2s. 6d., and out of that he
had to pay an offsider. One
famous artist, Jimmy the
Rambler, was always sure of
election. His temporary em-
ployers took the risk of his get-
ting liquor from visiting
hawkers. If this happened it
was his finish. Before his de-
parture on such occasions he
always prepared breakfast, and
when all were seated pro-
nounced his usual formula:
“I’m Jimmy the Rambler —
there’s chops for the natives
and stew for the imported men;
coffee’s in the two outside
buckets, tea in the middle, and the brownie’s
on the table; and blast you all, I’m off!”
* * * *
“Gouger”: In Cape York Peninsula
recently I picked on a healthy-looking ant-
hill out of which to make an oven. I
smashed in the thick outer crust with a pick,
then tripped over my ankles in surprise.
Disclosed was a crouching skeleton, his head
bowed on his hunched-up knees, his yellowed
wrists made fast to his bony ankles by
lashings of decayed kangaroo sinews. It
took time and patience to chip it all out,
for through his ribs were a thousand white-
ant tunnels; tunnels also ran through the
eye-sockets, giving admittance to a busy city
of ants within the skull. The local tribe
had the key to the story. A woman was in
it—of course. One day years ago Wirrimu
had disappeared and had never come back.
A week before his disappearance Girimin
had caught him making love to young Mrs.
Girimin. My pick had penetrated the mys-
tery of his disappearance. I wonder whether
the husband, after scooping out the anthill
and jambing his trussed-up captive within it,
had plastered up the wall himself or let the
ants do it. They would turn out in tens of
thousands to repair their nest, and in the
day or two required the captive could watch
the sunlight being blotted out by infini-
tesimal bits.

“Utu”: “Where is the thickest tree in
Australia?” asks “Yufu” (B. 20/10/27).
The largest and tallest trees, not only m
Australia but in the world, are the moun-
tain ash which grow in the Melbourne water
reserve and the adjoining State forest on the
Upper Yarra, from Mount St. Leonard to
Mount Baw-Baw. The average height of the
trees is the number of days in the year in
feet. In shady glens and favorable situa-
tions they rise well over 400 feet. The
tallest officially measured (1883) by Sur-
veyor-General Robinson was 471 feet, and
one on Mt. Baw-Baw topped 500ft. The
girths of the older trees in this forest area,
and also of a somewhat smaller area in the
Cape Otway hills, range at 12 feet above the
ground from 40ft. to 96ft.

“Pfella”: I had been teaching my West-
ralian abo. some of the social conventions,
formal introductions being part of the cur-
riculum. When I had him perfect in the
firm handgrip and the polite “Pleased to
know you, Mr. Blank,” I tried him o.n a
squatter we met when riding along the river.
“Jacky,” I said, “this is Mr. Woolbale.
Out shot a dark arm, and before the sheep
magnate could collect his wits he was wrung
fiercely by the hand. “Pleased to know yon,
Mr. Woolbale,” declared Jacky in loud tones.
Then Jacky remembered that it was the
proper thing to add some complimentary
personal remark. “By cripes, Mr. Wool-
bale, I bin know you as the biggest liar in
this place for 20 year,” he said.
* * * *
“Murkah”: It may sound odd, but the
departing godwit gulls that “Bihai” writes of
(B. 6/l0/’27) and the penguins arriving
from the Antarctic are very probably guided
in the same way—by currents. The cur-
rents of the upper atmosphere, in the one
instance, and in the other by those consti-
tuting the great rivers of the ocean. Even
in the case of birds, vision can be of no
use when the objective is thousands of miles
away. The time comes when instinct drives
the migrating hordes to follow the currents,
as their ancestors have done through the
ages.

CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN
ONE THIRD
Of the Huge Crowd of CARS at the
MELBOURNE CUP
(Comprising 109 different makes)
Were Fitted With
DUNLOP TYRES
This Statement is not guesswork, but an unassailable fact —based on the result of a systematic check taken of the
tyres fitted to the thousands of cars assembled in the various parking areas at Flemington on Cup Day.
Why is the “DUNLOP” SO POPULAR?
When one finds that out of 22 different makes of Tyres in a huge aggregation of Cars that
TYRE EASILY DOMINATES THE SITUATION, AND STANDS RIGHT AWAY BY
MUST BE STRONG REASONS FOR SUCH SUPREMACY.
ONE MAKE OF
ITSELF THERE
The Dunlop Aggregate almost Equalled that of any three other makes
Here is the Reason!
Dunlop Tyres are specially made to withstand hard driving on Australian roads —embodying the quality and
strength to ensure many thousands of miles of trouble-free motoring. They are dependable and economical, and
give such satisfaction to their users that “Dunlop” is today easily the most popular tyre among motorists.

SEPARATORS
Exide Separators are made of certain hard
and durable woods. They are treated by
a patent process, which whilst removing all
injurious elements retains some which are
definitely beneficial, preserving at the same
time the original toughness and porosity.
The Exide Wood Separator provides a
resilient support to the plates and effectively
insulates them. Being perfectly porous, the
acid has free access to the plate surfaces,
so that internal resistance is extremely low,
allowing the full power of the battery to
be utilised.

“Svranx”: Contrary to “M.L.C.’s” version
(B. 27/10/’27), the platypus’s consumption
of river fish is heavy. Despite his slow
motion, friend Plat, disposes of shoals of
small fry, numerous larger fish and pounds’
weight of spawn. The hunter’s method with
shoals is to shepherd the scared flock up
an estuary to a sandflat, where they are
scooped up in bulk by the well adapted beak.
Separated larger fish usually seek sanctuary
in narrow rock clefts, under snags and
among rushes, and this suits the flat-billed
one’s convenience. Between times he lazily
swims just above the sandy bottom of creeks,
his bill skimming the bed surface and shovel-
ling up a stream of deposited spawn.
“Barangkali”: I support “M.L.C.”; the
platypus does not do half the damage alleged
against him bv the Tas. Fisheries Commis-
sion. His short, squat body is not adapted
for speed; certainly he is not fast enough
to catch any of the nimble fry. Then he is
almost sightless, and relies upon his deli-
cate sense of touch when foraging for food.
Plat, is mainly nocturnal; except in seasons
when food is very scarce he does not venture
out in daytime. Most of the night is spent
on the muddy bottoms fossicking for food,
and he stows away the assorted catch of
worms, ova and mud in small clieek-pouches.
Rising to the surface, he leisurely masti-
cates the catch, systematically separating
and devouring the palatable food and reject-
ing the foreign matter. The time spent
below is regulated by the quantity of food
captured; it ranges from one to five minutes.
Six minutes’ entire submersion would mean
death.
* * * , *
“Tassie”: When the nenal settlement at
Sarah Island, on the Speck’s West Coast,
was vacated nearly a hundred years ago a
few raspberry-canes were left growing. Undis-
turbed for many years, they soon took pos-
session, springing up wherever a few inches
of soil had lodged among the rocks.
Periodically fires swept over the island, and
in course of time it was leased as a run for
horses, but yearly the raspberry-canes come
up. . In modern times picnickers have found
them a source of pleasure and sometimes of
profit. The fruit, though growing wild, still
maintains its fine flavor and has deteriorated
very little in size.
* * * *
. “Black Tracker”: When an old bushman
declared that the bandicoot was the champion
lightweight fighter of the bush I had my
doubts until I witnessed a set-to. A well-
grown buck was a regular visitor to my
camp at mealtime in search of scraps. One
evening when I threw him a bit of damper
a second buck made a dash for it. The next
moment the damper was forgotten, and the
two little chaps got to business. It was
the most active and savage fight between
animals I have ever seen. They dodged,
wheeled, feinted, clinched and used both teeth
and claws. The fight ended in a draw, both
having suffered much punishment. The
scrap of damper was carried off bv a slv
onlooker.
Milltrack”: Writers of recent pars
relative to the felling of big timber from
springboards should see a “high lead” tree-
climber at work. Jack Donald, employed by
the Vic. Hardwood (Company at Powell-
town, thinks nothing of climbing 150 feet
up a giant mountain ash to cut off the top.
NOTHIN’ TO WORRY ABOUT.
CITY COUSIN : “I don’t like sleeping in that room, Dave — it’s too
close to the chaff-shed; I’m sure there’ll be mice about.”
DAVE: “Ah, yer needn’t be scared, Mavis. There’s a couple of
snakes in there that’ll keep ’em from coming out.”
To aid him in climbing he has two immense
spurs strapped to his boots, and a belt
around his middle and the bole of the tree.
As he ascends, he trails his axe below him
at the end of a rope and lops off minor
branches. On reaching the required height,
he digs his spurs into the trunk, adjusts his
belt and proceeds to hack the tree through.
The dizzy swaying of the chimney-like stem
as the decapitated head plunges earthwards
has caused me many times to hold my breath
in apprehension for him, but Donald clam-
bers down as unconcernedly as if he were
using a 6ft. step-ladder.

“Homfrey Beale”: “Murray’s” experience
(B. 20/10/’27) reminds me. One day in
March, 1922, I noticed a gohanna busily
scratching on a sandy ridge not far from the
Murray River at Wodonga. Investigation
disclosed a turtle’s nest partly uncovered,
from which I lifted 14 eggs. I shot the
go., and its innards yielded another five. I
took the 19 eggs home and buried them after
the ihanner of a turtle. Nothing happened
till three days before Christmas, when 11
young turtles appeared. Next morning
another seven arrived. The remaining egg
was a blank, but it wasn’t one of the five
marked ones I'd rescued from the go.’s
tummy.
❖ Sjs JK ❖
“Bootle Lascelles”: The fish referred to
by “Saylor” (B. 22/9/’27) is the N.Q. sea
pike, called the barracoota at Thursday
Island, though clearly distinguished from it.
The sea pike is excellent eating. Its formid-
able teeth, which closely resemble those of a
dog, are very conspicuous and are capable of
inflicting a deep wound. When fully matured
it sometimes attains a length of sft., and
may weigh anything up to 851 b. It is
regarded by the abos. of Cape York as the
fastest swimmer of the sea.
$ $ * *
“Dai R.”: I struck a new idea in tobacco
cadging the other day; an old swaggie was
the exponent. He had a cherrywood pipe
with the bottom sawn off, so as fast as he
pressed the weed down the bowl it was
forced into the palm of his hand until he
had accumulated quite a little stock. The
trick was disclosed when he clumsily dropped
the pipe.
* * * *
“V.H.R.”: I was fishing in the Emu
River (Tas.), and, having just landed a nice
brown trout, was about to cast again when
I saw a large tiger-snake enter the water
from the opposite bank. Its business was
soon evident. The water at the time was
alive with whitebait, and I saw with
amazement the reptile devouring the small
fish. Can any Abo. reader say whether
fish comes normally into a snake’s diet?
* * * *
“Bony Bream”: There are worse things
to camp under than
trees (B. l/9/ - 27).
A few years ago I
had my bees at
Kersbrook (S.A.)
and, instead of
camping in a tent,
borrowed a small
6ft. x Bft. portable
hut from the owner
of the property.
One night a gale
sprang up, and the
first furious blast
tipped the little hut
upside down. Be-
fore I could dis-
entangle myself
from my blankets
another squall sent
the hut rolling
along the ground,
with everything
from my boots to a
camp-table falling
on me. The hut
stopped with a
crash against a big
blue-gum. Next
morning, %hen I
was clearing up the
mess, a companion
in misery came
along a swaggie
plastered with mud
and green slime. He
told me that he had
camped in a tool-
shed built inside the
stand of a windmill
tank, the bottom of
the tank forming
the shed’s roof.
During the storm
the mjll forced
itself into gear, and
quickly pumped the
tank nearly full.
Then the bottom of
the rotten recep-
tacle burst open, and
nearly 1000 gallons
of water fell on the
occupant of the
shed.
“Te W.” : Norfolk Island still has a few
terrestrial birds, including some robin-red-
breasts, a little green pigeon or dove, and the
widely-distributed bald coot or “red-bill.”
The white notornis, a coot on a gigantic
scale, has gone for ever. This bird, once
found on Lord Howe and Norfolk islands,
soon vanished from the limited areas, ending
ingloriously in the cooking-pots of the con-
victs and those of the mutineers of the
Bounty. Only one specimen of this extinct
fowl is known to have been preserved; it
is, or was, in a museum at Vienna. Vast
numbers of petrels, gulls and other sea birds
visit Norfolk Island, some breeding there.
At one particular season of the year the
inhabitants live chiefly upon the eggs of the
“whale-bird” or broad-billed dove-petrel.
* * * *
“Lamia”: I know The Bulletin once
made a collection of two-headed snakes, but
has any reader seen a snake with a perfect
head at each end ? One was killed not long
ago in Siam. The skin is kept for two
reasons: one because it is a curio, and the
other as evidence of the truth of at least
one snake yarn.
* * * *
“Up North”: On Nagliir Island (Torres
Strait) is a stone figure of Naga, the legend-
ary hero who brought culture to the island.
When people pass his statue they do so with
spears at the salute, or if carrying anything
they pass by with bowed heads and arms
covering the face. Formerly they crawled
past him. A shrewd old Samoan half-caste
took advantage of this. He proclaimed that
the spirit of Naga had made him guardian
of the statue and had given him the power
to prophesy and divine the future through
it. Thereafter people, on passing the image,
fell flat to the earth in terror of its voice.
Thus old Jimmy tallied off the pick of the
men for his boats’ crews. He settled all
disputes, arranged marriages and ran the
island and adjacent populations most satis-
factorily from his own viewpoint. To relieve
the monotony he occasionally made all on
the island, including his own crews, parade
to the figure and do humble obeisance, at
the same time depositing a token of their
esteem in the shape of a stick of tobacco, a
bunch of bananas or a basket of sweet buks
or yams. .Timmy’s scheme worked to per-
fection until old age stepped in. The stone
figure of Naga, however, never grows old,
and the people still bow to it when passing.
THE SONG OF THE LIZARD.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In the angle of the netting, at the Kurra-
jeena Well,
There’s a galvanised construction on the
flat;
In the winter it’s an ice-chest and in summer
it’s a hell,
But it’s home, because it’s there I hang
me hat.
There’s a galley leaning on it, where I
imitate a cook,
And a pile of ashes where I build me fire;
And to eastward and to northward, for
however far you look,
There s a never-ending line of posts and
wire.
Barb wire, old wire, steely wire and bright;
Strain it in the daytime, bang! it goes at
night;
Tight wire, loose wire, Yankee wire and
black;
Dotted well with hitches, taking up the
slack.
Once a week I ride the netting, and it’s
ninety miles around,
Just to euchre bunny’s game of hide-and-
seek ;
And I stand it up on forked sticks, if it’s
lyin’ on th’ ground ;
And—forget to put a post in every week.
lhere are mobs of bonser shade trees, and
they're mostly off the line,
And they're handy if you want to have a
sleep;
But the game of dodging Pompey isn’t good
enough for mine
When the overseer is poking through the
sheep.
Tie wire, burnt wire, rusty wire and plain ;
Twenty figure-eight knots to the blanky
strain.
Cheap wire, good wire, Aussie wire and new;
Wire whichever way he looks meets the
Lizard’s view.
It is peaceful on the netting, and you seldom
see the boss,
As the fireplough track is bumpy for the
car;
And a chap with brains will always pick his
possie for a doss,
So’s to keep ’em contemplatin’ where you
are.
I can do me bit of fisliin’, and I lay me
string of baits,
For a dingo’s always worth a quid, you
see;
And I get me scran and “Bully” at the
Seyenteen-mile gates ;
So a Lizard’s life is good enough for me.
SOME PEOPLE HAVE NO CONSIDERATION FOR COWS.
DAD: “There now, young feller, you’ve done it! Mind, if yer’ve frightened ’em off their
milk you’ll ’ave ter pay for it.”
Galv. wire, steel wire, twisted wire and tight;
Hear the flamin’ wallabies bounce off of it at
night!
Strong wire, soft wire, knotted wire and
cheap,
But any bloomin’ sort o’ wire will block
a blanky sheep.

CONCRETE ON THE FARM.
“Poncirus”: Concrete lias many uses on
the farm, especially in districts where •{tim-
ber is scarce and dear. The main principles
governing good concrete work are: —
The materials must be free from vegetable
matter and clay.
The stone or gravel should be hard and
of varying sizes.
There must be sufficient cement.
The materials must be mixed to an easy
working consistency, neither sloppy nor
crumbly.
There must be a thorough mixing of
the cement with the other materials before
adding water.
Vegetable matter, such as sticks, leaves,
grass, etc., will not bind with cement, and
they form weak areas in the mass owing to
these eventually decaying. They
may be removed by screening out sand or
washing out from stone. Clay may also be
washed out. The strength of concrete de-
pends upon the breaking-strain of the stone
in it, consequently a good job cannot be
made out of soft stone. Sydney sandstone
is not suitable. When concrete expands and
contracts, which it will do under varying
temperatures and moisture, it cracks along
the line of least resistance, which will be
where the softest stone is. The spaces in
between the big stones should be occupied
by smaller stones, and the spaces between
the smaller stones taken up by smaller ones
still, and so on right down to gravel and
sand.
What is aimed at is to get the surfaces
of all the stones, gravel and sand coated with
cement and the remaining spaces filled with
concrete. For good work the proportions
should never be less than one part of cement
to two of sand. The amount of stone added
may vary considerably.
Good footpaths, at a low cost, may be
made by breaking the stone in the position
the path is to occupy, top-dressing with a
mixture of one part of cement and two of
sand, and finishing off with a dusting of
pure cement over the surface while wet and
lightly trowelling. Breaking the stone in
position makes the work rigid. It is a good
plan to divide the path into sections by bat-
tens. Do alternate sections first and allow
each to set before proceeding with the other
sections. When completing, paper laid along
the edges between each section will establish
a permanent division, allow for expansion
and contraction and prevent the work crack-
ing in other places. Garden edging may be
done in the same way by filling in between
boards or battens laid in position and rein-
forcing with fencing-wire.
Gateposts may be made by using dis-
carded butter-boxes, with the bottoms and
tops knocked out and placed one above the
other; the concrete reinforced with iron
bars. The hangers for the hinges can be
placed in position before filling in with the
concrete. The surface may be smoothed
after the work has set by going over it with
a wash made of cement or cement and
sand. Use not less than one part cement to
two parts sand and from two to five parts
of gravel, according to the strength required.
For economical work use one part of cement,
two of sand and four of gravel, reinforced,
and when this has thoroughly set face it with
one part of cement to two of sand. Basalt
(blue metal) screenings, quartz and granite
are among the best gravel materials. Soft
sandstone is practically no good. Hard sand-
stone or ironstone will do.
Reinforce the posts with wire-netting for
light work, fencing-wire of varying gauges
for stronger work, and iron or steel bars
where great strength is essential. These
bars can be purchased from any lime and
cement store.
The timber used for the box frames
as moulds must be straight, seasoned
and not too rough. Ordinary sawn tim-
ber, Oregon pine for preference, | to one
inch thick, should be used. Lighter timber
will often warp and spoil the work, due to
the moisture and weight of the concrete.
The mixture should not be reduced to such a
consistency that it will easily pour. In
placing reinforcing material in the concrete,
bend it zig-zag and lean it from one side
to the other. The greatest strain on a
post is, of course, horizontally, but an
impact from a cart wheel is likely to split
it vertically, and if reinforced as described
the post will stand the shock.
Box frames for posts are made of timber
cut to the sizes required and screwed or
bolted together so that they can be taken
to pieces and used again. For wire fences
bolts can be put right through the moulds
to make holes for the wires before the con-
crete is poured in, and removed just before
the concrete has set.
CATTLE IN MAORILAND.
“Fernie”: Like Bananaland, Maoriland
is getting all hot and bothered over the beef
business. Beef-raising isn’t profitable in
M.L. even at the best of times —it ranks a
bad second even to wheat-growing. The Meat
Producers’ Board, which was set up by
Massey when meat prices flew down the
toboggan slide in 1921, has been doing its
best to boost beef production for six years,
but the M.L. cocky seems to prefer to pro-
duce mutton and lamb. The latest idea of
the board is to apply to beef the Australian
“Patterson scheme” that was intended to
assist butter and cheese producers. The
notion is to make the local population pay a
bit more for the stuff, and to use the impost
to add a bit on to the price received by the
cocky for produce that is exported. The
board proposes to take |d. a lb. on all beef
killed in M.L. so that it can give a bonus of
3d. a lb. on the beef that is exported. In
Maoriland, of course, with rich pastures and
a good rainfall, a certain amount of cattle-
raising helps the sheep industry. But the
M.L. cocky is up against these hard facts:
Beef, last season, averaged on export sales
£23 6s. Sd. a ton and cost £8 3s. 4d. a ton
to ship. Mutton brought £46 11s. sd. a
ton and cost £lO 4s. 2d. a ton to ship. Lamb
brought £7B Os. 6d. a ton and cost £lll9s. 2d.
to ship. Wool brought £IIS 3s. 2d. a ton
and cost £lO ss. 4d. a ton to ship. And
the comparative costs of cattle-raising and
slieep-farming, per head of stock, don't
encourage the cattle-raiser. As a matter of
fact the cattlemen have been enjoying a
sort of a subsidy, because the Meat Pro-
ducers’ Board in its bargainings with the
shipping companies has wangled- a light
freight on beef and conceded a little more
on wool than otherwise would have bean
charged. But subsidies and freight con-
cessions can’t make Fernland a cattle-ranch.
The country is too small and too mountain-
ous, and just as soon as the cattle herds get
to a number that makes export trade impor-
tant the cattlemen have reason to wish that
they were in some other line of business.
BABY BEEF.
“Furpliy”: Notwithstanding “Almanac’s”
statement to the contrary (B. 6/10/’2T), the
demand from consumers for smaller joints
of early-matured meat is rapidly growing,
and what the consumer demands the butcher
will presently ask for. The reason why
this class of meat is not more popular is
that the general public has not had a full
opportunity of proving its excellence.
The beast described by “FY7” is not in
any way freakish, but is a distinct type
evolved by breeders in other countries,
notably America, as a result of closer settle-
ment and the demand of the housewife for
better meat. What can be done in America
can be done equally well in Australia. It
is the breed as much as the feed which
produces baby beef, and to obtain the best
results Australian breeders must alter the
type of beast they are at present turning
out.
Australian conditions have produced a
rangy breed of cattle long of leg and neck
and very free in movement. This is the
result of large runs and long dusty walks
to water and feed in drought time. Im-
ported beef cattle are heavier of movement
and shorter in the neck and leg. This differ-
ence can be seen at any of the large shows.
. Naturally the typically Australian steer
is not at his best till four or five years old,
and that is the main reason we are being
offered beef of that age. Certainly not
because we prefer it to the younger stuff.
“Almanac” is confusing baby beef with veal
when he writes of pink color. The true
baby beeve at 18 months old is as matured
as to texture and color as an ordinary
Australian three-year-old steer. Apart
from popular taste economic conditions will
shortly make it imperative for us to so
alter our breed of beef cattle that we can
market two beasts in the same time as we,
at present, take to produce one fit for the
butcher.
BEEF IN BANANALAND.
“Dalgonally” : Realising that it has come
perilously near killing one of its most gilded
geese, the Bananaland Government is loud }
announcing its intention of investigating the
conditions of the meat industry with a view
to mending matters. There is really no need
for further investigation. The causes ot
the industry’s moribund condition are high
taxation, heavy railway charges and exces-
sive labor costs. These make it impossible
for the cattle-grower to carry out improve-
ments, especially in the way of water con-
servation, which would prevent a great per-
centage of wastage of condition in stock
otherwise compelled to travel miles tor
water. One of McCormack’s suggested pana-
ceas is the importation of high-class bulls,
to be made cheaply available to cattle-
breeders. But all the breeding in the worn!
is no good without grass and water, and
to get these ringbarking and dams and tanxs
are essential. Each beast on a run now costs
about £1 a head annually. A bullock cannot
be marketed till he is at least 4J years old;
say £4 10s. Railage to Brisbane, say, is £l,
with commission, yard and other dues taking
another 55., making £5 15s. The bullock,
going, say, GOOlb. dressed, may bring it
in the yard, leaving a nominal profit on that
particular beast of 255. Breeding-cows can-
not very well be sold till they are six or
seven years old—say which brings
costs, plus rail and commission, to £7 15s.
For such a beast £5 10s. would be a fair
yard price, and, counting in the profit on the
bullock, the grower would face a loss of £1
on that particular bit of business. Yet the
bullock can be expected to sell to the con-
sumer at, approximately, 20s. per 1001 b., or
£l3, and the cow will bring £lO 10s. There’s
a profit on the two beasts of £lO, less cost
of retail selling, but the cattle-raiser doesn’t
get it.
ANOTHER MAMMITIS CURE.
“V.G.” : Have used the cure for mammitis
given by “Sylvester” (B. 13/10/’27) and
found it useless. Its only virtue is the slight
alleviation of inflammation at the _ parts
where it is applied. The disease is too
deeply seated to be effectively banished by
external treatment. State-farms and leading
dairymen use the following with a high per-
centage of cures: To water (distilled) at
200° F. add as much boracic-acid as the
liquid will hold in solution. When at blood
heat only, about half a pint to one pint of
this liquid should be injected into each affected
quarter, the clotted milk being first drained
off. Greatest care is necessary in ensuring
the correct temperature of the solution, and
sterilisation of the apparatus; otherwise,
owing to the inflamed conditions of the mam-
mary system, any germs introduced therein
would find ideal breeding quarters. The
udder should be massaged in such a way as
to force the solution as far as possible
through the system, and an injection given
every morning and evening. Care should be
taken to effectually destroy all strippings
from infected quarters, mammitis being a
highly contagious disease. The efficacy of
this treatment lies in the fact that coagu-
lation of the milk due to inflammation is
prevented by the solution, which gets in its
healing properties at the same time.
LET THE MILKED COW STAY.
“Experience”: “Paul C.” (B. 22/9/’27)
advocates turning the cows out of the yard
as each animal is milked. I have always
found that this caused restlessness amongst
the cows, many of which would become sulky
and refuse to yield a large quantity of their
milk as a result. The animals are best left
undisturbed until the general herd is moved
in a body from the yard, when one cow has
the same chance as another to get her share
of the pasture or summer fodder. In the
case of a strange cow being introduced
amongst the herd, I have found it advisable
to milk her first, and let her go. Being a
newcomer her movements are not much
noticed by the herd. The same thing would
apply to a weak and defenceless cow. Such
animals are best moved out of the way in
a quiet manner, milking them first and turn-
ing them out of the yard without making
any disturbance. The old leaders in the
herd are the ones that are watched by the
others; where they go the main herd wants
to follow. “Paul C.” says thac cows kept
in the yard until milking is done cut the
surface up. My experience has been that the
cows cut the yard up more walking about
after their mates have been let out than if
allowed to stand as yarded, and let go
together.
HORSES AT THE WHEAT!
“Villers-Brett.”: When horses gorge on
wheat give them as much water as they can
drink. The idea is to wash the wheat into
the intestines. Very often it will bring on
rapid purging. Keeping them from water is
bad policy, as the saliva a horse swallows
is sufficient to swell the wheat in the
stomach. Water should be given as a drench
should a horse refuse to drink. Bicarbonate
of soda, 2oz. doses in water, is helpful in
preventing fermentation and the formation
of gas. A pint of raw linseed-oil should
be given as soon as possible after. Place no
faith in aconite or nitre. Should founder or
laminitis follow, stand the animal in cold
water for eight hours daily, and see that a
soft bed is provided at night. When trim-
ming the feet keep the toe as short as pos-
sible. If lameness persists the condition is
chronic and a rocking-slioe should be worn to
relieve it.
NUTS AS A SIDE-LINE.
“Hop Scrub”: As profitable side-lines in
fruit-growing, what’s wrong with nuts ? Nuts
to suit all districts can be found. The filbert
does well in cool districts, on almost any
type of land. It is pleasingly free from
insect pests and diseases, and is less sus-
ceptible to losses due to rain or frost than
most trees. The nuts are readily harvested,
dropping completely in three weeks, and
there is a ready market for them. Shelled,
they are sought after by lolly manufacturers.
Unshelled, they have a sale as an item of
dessert. Filberts require to be cross-pol-
linated. Barcelona, Babiana and White Ave-
line are the varieties. Plant the trees 20ft.
apart. Nuts fetch lOd. per lb., and yields
of a ton per acre have been recorded.
In warmer districts pistachios, the “sun-
dae” nuts, are well worth a spin. Similar
in climatic demands to the fig and olive, the
pistachio is a vigorous grower and bears
bountifully. A word of warning! It is
dioecious, like the pawpaw, and a male tree
to every six females is the rule. Kaz is the
male, and Red Aleppo, Bronte anil Trabo-
nella the harem. Give the trees ample room,
30ft. on the square at least. Twenty-five
pounds of nuts from an eiglit-year-old tree
is a fair thing, and they fetch 3s. to 4s. a
lb. wholesale.
Apart from a few almonds from S.A. and
a handful of walnuts from the tablelands
of Vie. and N.S.W., we import all our
nuts from the Mediterranean and pay big
prices for them. There’s no doubt about the
existence of a profitable local market.
CODLIN-MOTH REGULATIONS.
“11. M.” : The ink was hardly dry on my
par. re codlin-moth regulations (B.
13/10/’27) when the N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture issued an amended edict re-
garding the treatment of apple, pear and
quince trees. The new regulations provide
that the minimum quantity of arsenate of lead
1o be used shall be increased from ISoz to
20oz. powder, or from 320 z. to 40oz. to
50 gallons of water. The time for the first
Spraying stands, but the second spraying
must begin 14 days after the first spraying
and finish within seven days, and the third
spraying must be completed between Decem-
ber 12 and 18. The bandaging has been
deferred until December 1 (a month later
than the earlier regulations), and bandages
must be examined at intervals of not more
than 14 days up to February 23.
GRAPES IN COLD STORAGE.
“E.W.”: Interesting to viticulturists was
the exhibition at Sliepparton (Vic.) recently
of two 121 b. cases of Olianez grapes, which
had been kept in Government cool stores m
Melbourne since the beginning of April. In
one case the bunches were packed in granu-
lated cork, and in the other tissue paper
and wood-wool was used. The latter method
was the more successful, and the grapes came
out in splendid condition ; but the cork-
packed grapes were mouldy and unfit for
market. A temperature of 32 degrees
was maintained throughout. The experiment
is of importance, since it shows that the
season during which grapes can be put on
the market can be widely extended.
FERTILISING FRUIT BLOSSOMS.
“Larrapinta” : To fertilise the blossoms in
an orchard, strong swarms of bees are neces-
sary, and these can only be obtained by keep-
ing them in standard hives, with combs built
in frames on full sheets of foundation.
Swarms kept in petrol cases where they build
their own combs are usually half full of
drones, and never attain the same strength
as those with combs containing only worker
cells. Put the hives down on the side of the
orchard opposite that from which the pre-
vailing wind comes, with their entrances fac-
ing the east, so as to get all the sun possible,
but sheltered by a hedge or shed from south
or west winds. Kent properly, strong
swarms only need a few minutes’ attention
a week to keep them in order, and one good
colony of bees will fertilise the blossom on lo
acres of citrus fruit, 10 acres of apples or
stone fruit, and about five acres of lucerne,
when that fodder is wanted to run up for
seed. This information is gathered from my
own experience over a number of years in
S.A. In other States, where cold weather
occurs in the spring during the time the
trees are in blossom, more swarms per
orchard are required. Bees need a shade
temperature of 60 degrees before they can do
effective work, but even a few hours of warm
weather per day for a couple of days are
(Continued on jmge 31.)

THE FENCING CONTROVERSY.
“Hope On”: I do not agree with either
“Allambee’s” or “Longo’s” theories as ro
the position of the strut on the straining
post. I have used both methods suggested
with fair success. One day, while I was
erecting straining posts, an old fencer pass-
ing along stopped for a yarn and suggested
I should attach the struts about one-third
from the ground level. I gave it a trial,
found it the most satisfactory of the three
methods, and have continued to use it. The
post rigidly resists all strain.
GALVANISED BURR.
“Prop”: No time should be lost in having
the councillors of shires and members of
P.P. boards and their employees taught the
history of galvanised burr and the neces-
sity of having it quickly recognised and
destroyed on its first appearance. The burr
is spreading alarmingly, but it is so like in
appearance to our native roly-poly that,
though it is thick on some of the N.S.W.
commons, it remains unrecognised. The
outstanding feature is its color, which is
that of new galvanised iron. In shape and
size it is like roly-poly, but each branch
is thickly studded with slender needle-
pointed straight thorns. The habit of the
pest is to grow from the single plant into
beds of many yards in diameter. At Bol-
lon (Q.), where the burr is very thick, it has
been found necessary on some of the runs
to bandage the horses’ legs or put leggings
on all four to prevent injury from this plant.
I first saw galv. burr at Old Woolerina,
just over the border from Brenda, in 1918.
At that time it had practically taken pos-
session of the town of Bollon, so much so
that paths had to be hoed to get about the
town. Adjoining stations are thick with it,
and it extends in diminishing quantities to
Mitchell and Roma. At Roma on a pro-
perty I held from 1918-20 was a small patch
of the burr, and every few days I visited
the spot and always found some to hoe.
This year, one of the most severe drought
years known, I have seen the burr flourish-
ing at Moree, Garah, Coonamble, Warren,
Dubbo and Bourke, in N.S.W., and at Mor-
ven and on the Blackall Common of Q.
With the shifting of stock that has been
going on lately and the much greater re-
shuffling that will occur when rain comes,
this. burr, that is never eaten by stock, that
springs to life easily from seed, is made by
nature to be carried, and when once rooted
springs eternally, will cover the pastoral
lands of N.S.W. and Q. in tens, of thousands
of acres.
CROSSBREDS FOR QUEENSLAND.
“GG6”: For many years past attempts
have been made to run sheep on the strip
of land between the coastal range and the
sea which stretches practically from the
N.S.W. border to Cooktown (Q.) in the
Far North. There are intervening jungle
patches which are useless for the purpose,
but the greater part of this strip consists
of good soil well covered with native grasses
and blessed with a regular and plentiful
rainfall. The grasses, alleged to be too sour
by those early pioneers who failed to make
a success of sheep, carry cattle well enough,
and so for. a long period the coastal area
lias been given over to cattle. The sheep
tried in those days were merinos, which
have never prospered on the coast belt, or
even on the eastern limits of the Darling
Downs. Nowadays, backed by the officials
of the Agricultural Department, a move-
ment is afoot to stock the coast lands with
crossbred sheep, which have been found to
do better there than merinos. It is part
of the scheme that the indigenous grasses of
the coast, which are largely of tbe coarse
and wiry, type, should be reinforced by the
introduction of such proved fodder grasses
as Kikuyu, Rhodes, Sudan, Paspalum, and
others, which have been introduced to tbe
dairying districts in the coast belt and have
established themselves immediately.
Maoriland’s example is quoted by sup-
porters of the. movement. There the introduc-
tion of English and other overseas grasses
increased the carrying capacity of the land
tremendously and pushed the merino into
the backbround. The crossbred was found
to do better and prove a more profitable pro-
position. The climate of the Q. coast is more
favorable than that of Maoriland, and the
soil in places is better. Since tbe raising
of crossbreds is essentially a small-man
industry, as the term is understood in
Australia, holdings would not be too large
to improve with top-dressing, fodder-plant-
ing. and other additions to natural resources
such as would be impossible on the usual
large Queensland sheep-holding. An area of
about 1000 acres is recommended, half being
used for crop-raising and the balance for
carrying a mob of frohi 500 to 700 cross-
breds, to be increased as improved grasses
increase the carrying capacity.
By alternating cropping and grazing his
land, the farmer can add to the fertility of
both sections, while keeping his country
clean. Methods of the sort have proved a
great success in Maoriland, and if they can
be developed in the northern coast lands
will provide opportunities for a host of
small farmers unable to find an opening on
the other side of the range. All up the
coastal strip water is plentiful, and since
the Great Northern railway practically
bisects the strip from north to south, there
will be no trouble in getting stuff to
market.
BARF COUNTRY ROUND WATERING-
PLACES.
“Pythos”: Both “Furphy” (B. 6/10/’27)
and “N.M.L.” (B. l/9/ , 27) are a long way
out in several of their statements about
pasture around watering-places, except, of
course, on holdings in the wet belt. If they
were to come up to the back country of
N. S. Wales they would see paddocks in
which sheep feed out from water to the
farthest corners. In one particular pad-
dock this is exactly 11 miles, and. of course,
sheep making out to that distance can only
water once in every two or three days.
Take an average-sized paddock for the back-
country, say 10 miles by 10. The carrying
capacity would be, roughly, 3000 sheep, and
yet, in spite of “N.M.L.’s” contradiction of
the possibility of country being bare for a
radius of two miles around watering-places,
he can see wells and tanks surrounded by
absolute barrenness for three, four and five
miles. As he says, sheep come in on pads,
but considering that up to the present they
have been doing so for 18 months without
the germination of any seed during that
time, the state of the surrounding country
is not surprising.
YARDING EWES AND LAMBS AT
NIGHT.
“N.M.L.”: To yard a mob of ewes with a
big percentage of strong lambs at night is
totally different from doing the same work
in daylight. During the day wfide and care-
ful working is essential, and noise is to be
condemned. At night lambs, for some
strange reason, are tractable. They’re amen-
able to reason, noise huddles them closer
to their mothers, and they wouldn’t break if
you paid them. With a mob of lambs
gathered in clumps before sundown, when
getting to the wings of the yard, bustle them,
crack your whips, yell, make your dogs bark,
get in close on them and hustle them. If
some do chance to break, race in close to them
and yell. Treat them with contempt, handle
them with recklessness, and directly opposite
in every way to the care that has to be taken
in daylight.
ROLLING DOWN MULGA.
“L.H.H.”: The day of the scrub-cutter is
passing. In this district (Quilpie, s.-w. Q.)
there are already 14 tractors in use rolling
down the mulga. The tractors (Fordsons)
are fitted with a ram, the crosspiece of which
is attached to two be’arers on a level with
the top of the radiator. The rear ends
of the bearers project about 30 inches in
rear of the driving wheels and prevent the
tractor from turning over backwards. Mulga
up to three inches in diameter is pushed down
without any difficulty; anything bigger has
to be given a few chops with the axe.
On one station here two men are rolling
down daily a strip 24 feet wide and up to
four miles long. This feeds just 5000 sheep.
The saying over older methods is consider-
able, with the additional advantage that the
tractors can be diverted to other uses when
no longer required for scrub work.
JOHNSTONE GRASS.
“Yufu” : Can anybody tell me how to get
rid of Johnstone grass? It is prevalent on
the North Coast (N.S.W.), and will go
through a four-acre cultivation-paddock in
a few years. It only likes the best of soil,
and, like the nut grass, seeds above as well
as below the ground. A laborious way of
getting rid of it is to trench the soil and
pick out all the white roots which run snake-
like under the ground. Another, but costly,
method is to let grass grow over the cultiva-
tion ; paspalum or couch grass will kill it
off in three to four years. But isn’t there
some better method?
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Hope On”: A sixpenny stick of caustic
soda will dehorn all the season’s poddies on
the average farm. Do the calf before it is
five days old. Rub the moistened stick on
each horn bud (alternately, for a few
seconds) until blood starts to ooze, wdiich
will be in about five to ten minutes. Keep
the stick in a corked bottle or it will rapidly
dissolve.
“Jack Point”: Droppings-boards should be
used in all hen houses, about a foot under
the perches, and scraped clean every morn-
ing. Then place them in the sun, turning
once or twice till thoroughly dry. When dry
the droppings are quite clean and odorless,
and may be stored until required for use as
manure. It is important that they be
thoroughly dry, as if stored in a damp state
they soon lose a lot of their nitrogenous con-
tent. This practice will help to keep the
fowl-house clean and consequently more
healthy.
“Sylvester”: Improved cow-cane is a great
asset to the cocky, but when sown it does
not strike well, only about 75 per cent, of
the sets growing. Here is a tip: For every
1000 sets place about 250 in a pit and sow
the rest. At the first chipping select sets
from the pit that have shot to replace the
ones that have missed.
“E.W.”: A continual ration of green feed
for poultry can be obtained by making a

deep, on top of which is half-inch mesh net-
ting with solid side boards. Manure the
coop, and then sow lucerne. Cover the coop
with bags until the lucerne is almost to the
top of the netting, and then the birds will
help themselves through the narrow mesh of
netting. Of course, some of the lucerne will
be pulled by the roots; but if a further
sowing of seed is made the green feed supply
will be kept going.
“Trochar”: For dressing wounds on sheep
don’t use mixtures containing sheep-dip.
which is variable in composition. Preferable
is. a mixture of creosote and turpentine in
olive-oil, sometimes known as C.T.O. Any
non-irritant oil can be used. This mixture
is not only an efficient antiseptic for wounds
but a protective against the attacks of flies.
It is invaluable as a dressing to smear around
castration wounds.
“C.H.”: There is a cure for distemper in
dogs. I’ve tried it in many cases for many
years and never known it to fail when admin-
istered properly. It is simplicity itself.
Administer one grain of tartar emetic dry
at the back of the tongue. Only give one
dose and feed the dog on anything it fancies
to eat.
“Old Timer”: A sure, if slow, way to rid
land of blackberry vines is to cut them level
with the ground and. when dry, burn the
vines. Afterwards, take sheets of iron or
bark and cover over so that the soil will not
get any sun or light and leave for a few
months. Meanwhile keep a watch that no
shoots are left uncovered. Then remove the
cover and sow grass seed. I have cleared
scores of clumps that way. The covering
must be left till there is no vegetation living
under it.

MANY INVENTIONS.
Buncombe’s perpetual-motion machine was
adjudged mechanically perfect. The only fly
on the horizon was that no one could start
the blinking thing; so after a time Bun-
combe grew discouraged and invented the
magnetic sole. This was a simple foot
attachment which enabled the wearer to re-
cover coins and other valuables dropped by
a careless public without assuming an undig-
nified attitude. But results did not come
up to expectations, owing largely to the dis-
gustingly low magnetic co-efficients of the
precious metals. The. sole picked up nails,
bolts and horseshoes, but disdained scarf-
pins and diamond tiaras.
Buncombe next invented the expanding
tramcar. He was a fat little man, and he
got the idea while hanging to a strap, with his
head nestling inadvertently on a corpulent
lady’s bosom. His car was constructed of
an alloy of aluminium and Para rubber,
thus combining lightness with _ elasticity.
The expanding mechanism was ingeniously
operated by the weight of the on-stepping
passenger. This was cumulative in its effect
and caused the car to expand one foot in length
[or every hundredweight of passenger added,
while extra seating accommodation was
obtained by simply detaching the collapsible
seats from the interior walls of the vehicle.
Experts hailed the invention as the solu-
tion of all traffic problems, and tired office-
girls had rapturous visions of a seat on the
evening tram.
It was the conductors who tore the fabric
to ribbons. They said they were paid to
ride on the cars, and if they had to walk
up and down a contraption half a mile long
they might as well be postmen, or join the
foot police.
Buncombe has gone to South America now
to see if they can get a revolution out of
his perpetual-motion machine.

RHYMES UP TO DATE.

When gallants come a-sueing,

But then I says to Em “Now, what’s it

A DEATH IN THE FAMILY.
“Looking sad this morning, Simpson—any-

“Yes, my season ticket has just expired.”
But ’e was a mongrel,
A three-star mongrel!
If ’e comes back ’e’ll get the glad sur-

If ’e comes up ’ere a-chasin’—
See, I’ll push ’is ugly face in,
With its nasty, squmty, interferin’ eyes.

with Rexona Soap, and find there is
nothing its equal for keeping the
hair in perfect condition.”
To all lovers of outdoor sports, a dip in the roaring
breakers on a summer’s day is indeed romance. Next day
the sunburnt, blistered hands and scarlet face are painful
realities. Why suffer such distress and disfigurement from sun-
burn when it can easily be avoided by always using Rexona
Soap when you have your shower and then applying a little
Rexona Ointment, the cooling, soothing and healing balm?
If you want to make doubly sure of avoiding sunburn, apply the
Rexona Ointment to the exposed parts before going into the surf. This
prevents both the action of the salt water and the sun on the most
delicate skin.
If this is done there will be no after-effects from exposure to the
sun, no regrets after a happy day, for the skin, soothed by the wonderful
influence of Rexona the Rapid Healer, will quickly regain its normal
temperature and comfortable coolness.
You will find Rexona Skin and Facial Soap ideal as a shampoo for
the hair after your dip.
Rexona Soap and Rexona, the Rapid Healer, in its dainty pot,
should stand on the toilet table of all who indulge in outdoor sports.

The Faithful Wife.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Mr. Stedman has lived and travelled extensively
in Mongolia, and in a brief series of short stories he
gives The Bulletin a graphic description of life
and customs in that little-known land.]
SCORES of urtas scattered over many
miles of the treeless steppes of Mon-
golia stood deserted, for their inhabi-
tants had journeyed far to take part in the
celebration of the second wedding of Badmai,
the wealthy one. Relatives, friends and even
strangers still remember and spoke of his
first wedding many years ago. They recalled
with pleasure the wonderful feast, and they
had good reasons to expect the forthcoming
festival to excel the previous one, for since
then Badmai had prospered exceedingly and
his sheep and cattle had multiplied beyond
counting.
Nor were the guests disappointed. For
three days and three nights everybody was
made welcome. They ate meat and drank
coumiss till they could neither eat nor drink
any more. Batarchin, the native minstrels,
played upon their guitars and sang hymns
in praise of Badmai’s wealth, goodness and
generosity. Lamas, too, were present and
distributed blessings; and on every tongue
was the tale of the wonderful price Badmai
had paid to his fatlier-in-iaw for the bride.
Two hundred sheep, one hundred head of
cattle and fifty horses! But when the bride
was seen riding her grey horse, in a saddle
studded with silver ornaments, her feet en-
cased in hand-embroidered unta resting in
stirrups of pure silver, and her fan-shaped
head-gear glittering in the sunshine, all,
agreed that the price was not too high,
particularly when two important things
were considered: firstly, Badmai was an old
man; secondly, the price would be returned
to him as dowry with the wife.
Badmai’s first wife, Ourgarlu, was also
present and partook of the good things cheer-
fully. She was getting too old to do the
hard work of milking cows and gathering
argal (dung) for the fires, and she knew
that the young wife would do these heavy
labors, while the old one would attend to
the lighter duties at home. So why should
she complain?
Badmai had a new urta erected, wherein
he lived with his young wife. They all
had their meals together, but otherwise the
wives lived apart; for such is the wise cus-
tom of the land. Their husbands had little
time to spend at home. It is not a man’s
business to stay with women ; he must visit
his neighbors, learn the latest news, discuss
politics, or talk with a lama about things
divine. So Badmai was engaged most of the
day, while the women remained at home and
did the work.
The young wife felt slightly disappointed,
for she had expected a little more of mar-
riage ; but she expressed no complaint. The
match had been arranged by her father with-
out consulting her, and she had no doubts
regarding his wisdom. True, Badmai was
much older than she; but, as her father put
it, age has its advantages—practical experi- .
ence, wisdom; a knowledge of the world
acquired with years. Also, was he not skilled
in the ways of matrimony? In any case, she
must obey her father as she would obey her
husband later; for such is the custom and the
law. Old Ourgarlu taught her husband’s wife
her duties, acquainted her with Badmai’s
likes and dislikes, and generally behaved
toward her as a mother. She felt no resent-
ment or jealousy. “I had my day,” she said.
“Badmai was mine when I was young.” The
FOung wife often, sought Ourgarlu’s aid and
advice, and thus life ran smoothly, varied only
by the tasks performed from day to day.
The arrival of Ivan caused a little stir in
the quiet life of the urtas, for Ivan came to
buy sheep, .wool and furs, and Ivan was
Badmai’s friend. Ivan showed signs of un-
mistakable pleasure when he met the young
wife, and he presented her with a string of
beads, large red beads, which delighted her;
he also brought Badmai a flask of Russian
vodka, which was a treasure indeed.
In the evening they sat around the fire,
which was in the centre of the urta, Badmai
sipping the vodka, each sip accompanied by
loud smacking of the lips. And Ivan smoked
Badmai’s pipe in token of friendship.
Old Ourgarlu retired early to her own
quarters, but the young wife sat patiently
waiting for her husband’s command. The cup
of vodka finished, Badmai began to sing a
plaintive song in accord with his mood. The
words were suggested by the various objects
his eyes rested upon or scenes that he remem-
bered. It is not the custom of his land to
repeat a song composed by someone else, for
how can another’s words express a man’s
feelings? So Badmai sang in a low voice,
his eyes half-closed and his head heavy with
the fumes of the vodka.
“Make the beds!” he at last ordered.
She spread a large felt blanket where they
usually slept. Then Badmai asked for a
blanket to be spread on the opposite side of
"he fire. When this was done Badmai indi-
cated the place Ivan was to occupy next to
the young wife, while he himself retired to
the opposite side.
Neither Ivan nor the young wife was sur-
prised ; it was fit and proper that Badmai
should honor his guest.
Several days had passed and all Ivan’s
business had been transacted, yet he con-
tinued to stay at the urta, finding many
excuses for delay; and Badmai honored him
as a guest, for such is the custom of the land.
He continued to supply Badmai with vodka,
while Ivan branded the sheep he bought and
enjoyed the company of Badmai’s wife, who
obeyed the wish of her husband, though now
reluctantly, for had not Ivan completed his
business? Old Ourgarlu, too, went about sullen
and silent, for she did not like Ivan, whom
she knew of old and to whom she also had
had to pay her respects in former days. She
spoke to Badmai. asking him how long Ivan
would remain at the urta. But Badmai could
say nothing; only that it would be unworthy
of him and against tradition to turn a
friend out of his home.
But Ourgarlu was not satisfied; she sus-
pected Ivan of stealing sheep and of pur-
posely lingering at the urta because of
Badmai’s young wife. She therefore devised
plans to force him to leave; she even begged
him to go. But Ivan only laughed, and
poured a little more vodka into Badmai’s
flask.
Suddenly Ourgarlu changed her attitude
toward Ivan. She appeared pleased to he
in his company and showed him great con-
sideration. Ivan was glad of the change, and
with pleasure accepted her invitation to visit
her urta.
When he entered. Ourgarlu sat near the
fire smoking her pipe.
“Ourgarlu has not shown Ivan friend-
ship,” said the man.
THE THING THAT MATTERS.
“A very different sort of hell than our old parson used to tell us about, eh?”
“Yes, that’s so. But, mind you, he doesn’t say it’s under new management.”
“Ourgarlu is the friend of her husband's
friends.” answered the woman.
“Listen, Ourgarlu,” continued the man.
“Can yon not see that Badmai is old, and
when he dies neither you nor your children
will get anything? Yet you worked all your
life! ’
“You are right, Ivan,” answered Ourgarlu;
“I did work all my life.”
Then why not see that you and your
children get what belongs to you?” Ivan
asked.
She smoked in silence, and the man,
waiting a while, spoke again, but in a more
familiar tone: “Thou hast known me many
years, Ourgarlu, and I am thy friend. If
it be thy wish, I will help thee.”
“How can you help me?” she asked calmly.
“I can see that'thou and thy children are
left the only heirs.”
“And what do you expect to get?” she
asked.
“Half of all you inherit.”
She gazed into the fire, her face remaining
imperturbable.
"Is it a bargain?” asked the man eagerly;
and calmly she answered: “Be it so.”
Smiling happily Ivan lit his pipe, and soon
appeared to be deeply in thought, evolving
plans for the execution of his project.
He spat into the fire; whereat Ourgarlu
looked startled, for Ivan had broken the law
and had offended the gods; -but he did not
notice anything, for he was too preoccu-
pied with the wonderful visions of great
wealth which was now within his reach.
“When will Ivan do what he has set his
heart upon?” asked the woman.
“To-night, Ourgarlu—to-night,” answered
the man excitedly.
“I am glad you have opened your heart
before me,” said Ourgarlu, and to seal the
bargain she proposed drinking some coumiss.
When she returned with two small wooden
bowls in her hands she found Ivan lying
on the felt mat with his feet to the image
of Buddha. So once more Ivan broke the
law; but she said nothing.
Raising the shallow cup which Ourgarlu
offered him, Ivan said: “Here is to our
friendship, Ourgarlu!” and drained the cup.
But Ourgarlu poured the contents of her
cup into the fire.
“What is the matter, Ourgarlu?” the man
cried in surprise. “Do you refuse to drink
the cup of friendship with me?”
“I cannot drink friendship with one who
betrays a friend,” she answered, and re-
sumed her former position near the fire, re-
lighting her pipe.
“What about our bargain?” he asked
enviously.
“The bargain stands,” she answered, and
immediately added —“if you can carry out
the contract.”
Then Ivan began to feel uneasy, disliking
the behavior of the woman. He was en-
deavoring to penetrate the mask that was
her face when suddenly a shiver ran through
his body.
“Ourgarlu,” he cried stricken with terror,
“what did you do to me?”
“Only what you intended doing to Badmai
and his wife,” she answered.
Like a wild beast he sprang upon the
woman. Bruised and bleeding she soon lay
on the mat, but not a sound escaped her.
Great beads of sweat stood upon Ivan’s
forehead.
“Ourgarlu,” he begged, “have pity on me.
Save my life; for you have the means to
do it.”
He seized her bands, but she remained
immovable.
Realising the hopelessness of appealing to
her, he stood up. Drawing a heavy pistol
from his pocket he addressed the woman.
“Are you going to save me, Ourgarlu, or
do you want to come with me?”
“Ourgarlu lias lived long and is not afraid
to die,” she answered.
“Then die you shall!” he cried, and took
aim slowly, deliberately, still hoping the
woman would change her mind. He knew
she had given him the deadly poison Badmai
used for poisoning foxes.
“One more chance, Ourgarlu,” he said.
But the woman remained silent.
He felt the second attack of pains
approaching and pulled the trigger.
When the smoke rose the dead body of
the woman lay on the mat. Not far away
was the man, still alive, but wishing for
death to come as a deliverer.
* * * *
Badmai discovered the dead bodies in the
morning, and was greatly grieved, for now
he thought he understood the reason for
Ivan’s delay. Nobody mourned after her,
nor was her body sewn into a blanket. She
was carried some distance away from the
urtas and placed on a hillock. And no one
sang praises to her.
But three days later, when, according to
custom, Badmai went to view the body, he
found only the bones, the flesh having been
eaten by wild dogs or wolves. Then did
Badmai realise what a good woman she was,
for had she been unfaithful the beasts would
surely not have eaten her.
Whereupon he hired women to wail for
her and minstrels to spread her fame over
the land. And even to this day, when the
sun goes down and twilight casts a spell
over the steppes, one may see an old woman,
surrounded by a cluster of eager children,
relating the tale of Ourgarlu the faithful
wife.

“Phil P.”: Jerome K. Jerome’s death
recalls The Bulletin’s brief review of
No. 1 of his magazine, To-day. It filled one
line : “To-day —the sweepings of yester-
day.”
“Mullarula”: My friend Blank, who sells
pianolas on t.-p., has struck a new snag.
He sold a pianola to Mrs. Dash. A door-
frame was damaged as the instrument was
carried into a room. The payments stopped.
When the men came to take possession it
was found that the pianola could not pass
through the repaired door-frame. Blank
says that though the law allows the seller
to recover possession it docs not allow him
to chop a passages through which the article
can be taken from the room, and when 1 last
saw him it was still there.
“Homfrey Beale” : Monty Grover is prob-
ably unaware that he once inspired a really
humorous parody of a ballade by Hubert
Church. M.G. was temporarily absent from
the Sun’s chief editorial chair, and at the
end of the week a linesman, who complained
that he wasn’t getting a fair spin from the
locum, burst forth on a handy typewriter:—
Towers of daisies will we build,
Gold will we bring, and frankincense,
And snow-white flour all newly milled,
If Thou wilt be our prop and fence
’Gainst lesser men who starve us hence
To rags of ardent rivalree:
Be Thou our bulwark and defence,
Give back O Lord, our Monty G.
“Si Anu” : Singapore is finding it increas-
ingly difficult to control the smuggling of
rubber. During the first quarter of the
present year 112 arrests were made, 1700
piculs of the contraband was seized and fines
of nearly half a million dollars were imposed.
Some people estimate that, despite the pre-
ventive fleet of speed motorboats, over 3000
piculs get through monthly, which figure is
quite sufficient to prevent the Stevenson
restriction scheme from achieving its object
of raising prices. The Malay-born seaman
and latent pirate has come into his own
again. Wealthy Chinese finance him, pay
his fines, support his family while he is
in gaol and give him a handsome present
when he emerges. There are thousands of
tidal creeks and a riddle of islands along the
Malacca Strait, and the Dutch island of
Sumatra, where restriction doesn’t operate,
is just over the way.
“Mabiang”: Just now, when pearl-shell is
low in price, most of the island-owned boats
in Torres Strait are concentrating on
trochus-shell. Its collection requires special
knowledge; the newclium who goes out ex-
pecting to pick up the stuff wherever lie
drops anchor is likely to suffer. Troclius is
best gathered rt “clear water,” which occurs
at new moon and full moon. In cold weather
it retires beneath the rocks and has to be
laboriously picked out by the under-water
worker; for this reason July and August
are bad working months. When feeding, it
moves along the coral bottom —its normal
location—with the conical shell well raised ;
it is then easy to collect. But boat crews
never know how their luck will pan out. A
Japanese-captained lugger with a good crew
for an afternoon’s work secured only a
kerosene-tinful of shell. Preparing to clear out
next morning, the skipper saw an island
lugger that had anchored alongside his boat
during the night bring up five bags from the
same spot.

Information Sought.
Can you suggest anything to rid pumpkin-
and melon-vines of the orange-hacked lady-
bird. — lBB7.
You may be referring to one of two species
of beetles which commonly attack these
plants. One is the pumpkin-beetle (Aulacop-
hara), a small narrow-bodied beetle, orange-
yellow in color with two black patches on
each wing cover: the second is the leaf-eating
ladybird beetle ( Epilachna 28-punctata),
orange-yellow in color with about 28 black
spots on the upper surface. The larvae or
grubs of this beetle also feed on the foliage.
Both pests can be controlled by spraying
with arsenate of lead, using lib. arsenate of
lead powder to 40 gallons of water, or, if
arsenate of lead paste is used, lib. to 24
gallons of water. It is important that the
plants should be thoroughly wetted by driving
the spray on to the under surfaces of the
leaves as well as th° tops. Use a knapsack-
pump if you have no power-spray.
(Jan you recommend a hook to serve as a
preparation to practical experience in sheep
farming? —2165.
“Sheep Farming and Station Manage-
ment” by E. 11. Pearce (215.), Angus and
Robertson, Sydney.'
There is a deserted house in the hush near
Attany (TP. .4.) called “ Lawson’s Place.”
Did the poet ever live there? —1850.
Peter Lawson, Henry’s brother, says that
old humpies in which it is alleged Henry
once lived are numerous. The story of the
Albany house originated from a yarn,
“Alligator Desolation,” written by Henry
while in Albany with Peter. They first
stayed at Swarbrick’s boarding-house and
afterwards in the workmen’s barracks at
the Two Mile loco, yards of the Great
Southern Railway Co.
Is it illegal for a couple married hy a
registrar to he re-married before a clergy-
man, the lady using her maiden name f Is
it illegal if the lady uses her husband's
namet —2l4l.
You confuse two distinct things: a legal,
or civil, marriage and a religious ceremony.
Clergymen are licensed to perform the legal
requirements of the,civil marriage and they
embody them in a ceremony. The Registrar
or his deputy carries out exactly the same
requirements but without any religious, rites.
Having been married by a Deputy-Registrar,
no religious ceremony will make your mar-
riage more valid in the eye of the law than
it already is. There is no objection to you
supplementing the existing legal union by
any religious ceremonial you may desire.
After marriage the woman takes her hus-
band’s surname and cannot legally use any
other.
Definition of a novel? —2089.
A fictitious prose tale or narrative of con-
siderable length published _in book form, in
which characters and actions professing to
represent those of real life are portrayed.
What is the difference between the “Casa-
nova Memoirs ,” as published by a society
of that name in an expensive 12 -vol. edition,
and that of the “Navarre Society ” in two
volumes? —2o69.
The former is a complete translation oy
Arthur Maclien, with a few chapters by
Arthur Symmons. It is very comprehensive
and well done. The latter is abridged, but,
to quote one critic, is “Casanova with the
dull parts left out.”
flow is a barometer set? —2030.
At the back of an aneroid barometer is
a sunken screw. Turn slightly with a screw-
driver, at the same time watching the move-
ment of the hand. After each slight adjust-
ment remove the screwdriver and tap the
glass face to steady the hand. This must be
repeated until the desired position is ob-
tained.
Could you yive me some information and
advice regarding cotton in Australia? 1
am 26 years old, and served my apprentice-
ship of five years with the Liverpool Cotton
Association, Ltd. —2050.
The British Australian Cotton Association
advises that the growing of cotton hi
Queensland is developing slowly, though it
has reached a fairly stable basis, and that
the labor market so far as the production end
is concerned is fully supplied. As the indus-
try is seasonal the number of permanent
positions is limited. The manufacturing
side of the business is growing and gives
promise of developing. Anyone with your
qualifications would be more likely to fit in
on the manufacturing side. The Queensland
Department of Agriculture may be able to
help you further.
Have written thousands of pars, and
hundreds of articles but desire to learn to
write short stories. Are any of courses advei'-
tised worth ivliile, and what do they cost? —
2m.
Such courses cost about from £lO 10s. to
£l3. Very few of the successful writers with
whom The Bulletin is acquainted ever took
any course. Considering your experience you
should soon be able to ascertain whether
you have the ability to write short stories.
Would microscopic examination after
death reveal whether a child had died of
tetanus or meningitis? —2o47.
The tetanus bacillus is rarely found any-
where else but in the actual initial wound.
On the other hand the disease shows a few
characteristic signs in the brain and spinal
cord if examined post-mortem. Meningitis
occurs in many forms, cerebro-spinal, in-
fluenzal, pneumococcal, tubercular, etc. In
some cases the organism can be seen under
the microscope, in other cases it cannot. It
depends entirely on the particular type of
meningitis from which the iabient is suffer-
ing.
Can I learn to become a compositor or
printing-machinist by mail? —2080.
The only institution we know that teaches
composing by post is the Sydney Technical
College; the fee is £1 for three terms (syl-
labus posted). As yet there is no >corres-
pondence course for printing machinists.
What is the best process for extracting
oil from garden mint and is there any text-
book that would help me? —1889.
The process of extraction is by distillation
and the separation of the oil from the water.
This requires knowledge and skill. The
average yield of oil is about 1 per cent.
Know of no work specially dealing with the
subject, but references are to be found in
works such as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
What is the meaning of “Cumberoona”
and “Mufcinbudin” ? —2002.
“Cumberoona” means crooked river;
“Mukinbudin” appears to be a compound of
“Mukine” meaning fern and “Buddin” sun-
beam.
How can I obtain a job in the lighthouse
service ? —2006.
Applicants for Commonwealth lighthouse
positions must be returned soldiers or
Australian Navy men who have had active
service abroad. Other essential qualifica-
tions are Morse signalling and sea experi-
ence —A.B.’s are preferred. A person
desirous of a position on Queensland coasts,
if eligible, should apply to the Deputy
Director of Lighthouses, Petries Bight, Bris-
bane, for an application form.
Why cannot a widow almost destitute and
in bad health receive a pension under the
N.S.W. Act unless she has children under 14?
—2048.
Section 13 (2) (a) (iii.) of the Widows’
Pensions Act, 1925, reads as follows:
“Subject to this Act, a widow shall not be
qualified to receive a pension unless she has
at the date of her application for a pension
certificate a child under the age of 34 years
who is dependent wholly or mainly upon her
for support.”
(1) Has any person the right to enter a
run held under Western Land lease
(N.S.W.) and cut timber without permis-
sion from the owner or manager in charge?
(2) Has the owner or manager the right to
give such permission when the improvements,
for which the timber is required, are not for
that particular run? (3) What is the late
regarding stock routes passing through the
run?— 2o2l.
(1) Any person authorised under the
N.S.W. Forestry Act may enter the lease
and cut and remove timber without first
getting lessee’s consent. (2) The lessee
has no right to grant permission for the
cutting and removal of timber from the
lease except as under Clause 11, that is, for
improvements on the particular lease. (3)
Any person authorised under the Forestry
Act may remove timber from stock routes
passing through the lease.
Can you tell a Vic. cow-cocky in what
terms N.S.W. dairymen are paid for cream
delivered at butter factories; are the books
of the factories audited by the Government
auditor; and how does the N.B.W. compare
with the Victorian system? —22sl.
In N.S.4V. dairy-farmers are paid in terms
of commercial butter* and the Government
audits the factory accounts to see that each
farmer lias distributed to him liis share of
the whole butter made from the cream
delivered at the factory. The Government
audit ensures that the quantity distributed
to the farmer, the quantity manufactured
and the quantity sold are all entered up in
terms of commercial butter and balanced
every month. In Vic. there is now an agita-
tion among dairy-farmers to revert from
payment in terms of butter-fat to payment
in terms of commercial butter on the N.S.AV.
system, as recent investigations by the Vic.
Department of Agriculture revealed that io
many instances there was a discrepancy of
as much as 10 p.c. between the quantity
returned to the farmer and the quantity
manufactured from his cream.
(1) I was born at Burra Burra (8.A.)
and require birth certificate for Old Ape
Bension purposes. Where can I get it? (2)
Where can my wife get hers- —she was born in
Norfolk, England? (3) I have £lOO invested
in Commontoeallh War Loan returning £5
per annum. Will it affect my application for
0.A.8.? —2250.
(1) Write to Registrar-General, Adelaide
(S.A.). (2) Write General Register Office,
Somerset House, London, W.C.2 —the cost
will be ss. Id. (3) The amount will not
affect yqur application and no deduction will
be made from the pension.
/ propose seeking domestic work by the
day in Sydney. Should I advertise or apply
to a registry office? If I lived at Summer
Hill or Hurstvillc would I be too far from
the city to be convenient for daily work? —
2166.
Advertise first. Summer Hill and Hurst-
ville are on the main suburban railway lines,
four and nine miles respectively from the
city. Each lias good services.
1 am being pressed for costs awarded,
against me in recent legal actions. I possess
nothing, having transferred my property to
my daughter some nine months before the
first action. T owed nothing and titles were
clear when I transferred. What is my
position? —2lo4.
A voluntary conveyance such as you
appear to have made to your daughter may
be challenged by a third party if it be con-
trary to the policy of the Bankruptcy Law
of the State or other laws intended for the
protection of creditors. If it could be shown
that the conveyance in question was made
with a view to avoiding costs incurred by
you in litigation it could be set aside.
Mow can I mend a galvanised-iron tank
which is full of pinholes? —2lss.
A great deal depends on the size of the
holes, but, unless they are fairly large, two
or three coats of Elateritc painted over the
interior of the tank should effectively stop
the leaking. If the holes are fairly large
and numerous, try using canvas or un-
bleached calico as a membrane between the
coats. That is to say, paint the inside of
the tank with one coat of Elaterite, and when
it has become partly dry but is still “tacky,’’
spread the canvas or cloth over the painted
surface, where it will stick firmly. After
this underneath coat has dried, paint two
coats over the top of the canvas. It would
not be advisable to use tar in a case such
as this, as it would taint the water. Before
applying see that all grease, dirt, etc., are
cleaned off the metal. The paint will cost
17s. 6d. per gallon, will cover 450 sq. feet,
and can be obtained_from L. A. Cormack, 4
Underwood-street, Sydney.
Why did Sinclair Lewis write “Elmer
Gantry” ?—2175.
(1) To make money. (2) To expose the
methods of a type of clergyman common in
America. He had an ample framework of
facts to clothe with fiction.

If you know the date and place of birth of vour

BRAKING EFFICIENCY.—The internal
emergency and external service brake
bands are wide and long-wearing, as well
as being notably efficient in action.
OMPARE it point by point—test it under any conditions —the
Brockway 35cwt. Highway Express embodies distinct improve-
ments that definitely increase its life and decrease running
expenses.
Firstly, its overhead valve motor, developing 30h.p. at an engine
speed unusually low —2 100 r.p.m. Actually, the motor works less than
others in doing the job you set it. That naturally reduces wear and tear
—increases reliability. No 35cwt. truck has a larger engine, nor one
offering equal reserve power.
Then, the lubrication system —pressure-feed through drilled crank-
shafts —overhead valve mechanism running in oil bath with force-feed
through hollow rocker shafts. Engineers know no better method.
Finally, the gear box, fitted with Timken tapered roller bearings
easily adjusted to take up wear —the two-piece propeller shaft, with
Spicer universal joints—the spiral bevel-gear drive —the full-floating rear
axle —the high-tension magneto ignition, the stout chassis with 5 cross
members.
Every one a clear feature of Brockway superiority. Careful records
of service prove that. A test will convince you.
The Highway Express averages 1 5 miles per gallon of petrol—less
than half a pint of oil per 1000 miles. Its equipment is complete,
including 532 x 6 cord tyres. Absolutely no extras to buy. Call at the

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
The cracks of the Cup meetings having
gone back to other States or been retired
until the autumn, fields at Caulfield on
Saturday were mostly of ordinary handicap
quality. A few horses above the average were,
however, among the 12 starters for the Arma-
dale Handicap, which was worth £l3O0 —a
nice consolation prize, but the V.A.T.C.
could afford it. Affirm, who had finished
second in both Caulfield and Williamstown
Cups, was the popular pick, his closing price
being 3 to 1. Bunkie and Valwyne were
backed, but the bookmakers were
willing to go on at fives; Eridanus was at
sevens, Valorem, Epilogue and Lonicera at
tens, Thracian and Reputed King at twelves
and Bard of Avon at fifteens.
Quickest into his stride, Bard of Avon
led out of the straight from Epilogue, Loni-
cera and Valwyne. Racing up the hill, Bard
of Avon still had charge, but at the five-fur-
.ongs post Epilogue headed him, only to
give way to Valwyne. Norman Falkiner’s
mare did not lose her lead afterwards;
though Bunkie finished well, he found 171 b.
too much of a difference, and Valwyne beat
him by half a length, Reputed King being a
fast-finishing third and Tookarby—tailed off
early -fourth. Valwyne’s form had been
poor of recent weeks, and she was in with
the nice weight of 7st. 101 b. Produced with
Holt s best polish on her, and with Duncan
to do the riding, she ran about the best
race of her long career—she is now in her
sixth season on the turf—as the time (2min.
19sec., a course record) signifies. Affirm
galloped like a tired horse.
The Cad, a most consistent youngster,
was all the rage for the Stansmore Handi-
cap, 9 to 4 being the best when bags were
closed. He was always at or near the
front, and though he shifted about a bit the
unsexed son of Lucknow—Stage Girl had too
much pace for the others, winning by nearly
his own length from Clarion Call (8 to 1),
who was only half a head in front of a
100-to-l shot, Vice Regent. The Cad is
trained by Prank Godby for old-timer Jack
Brewer, and was ridden by “Tich” Wilson.
His victory was naturally popular, but the
same cannot be said of the success of his
half-brother Ambassador in the Ormond
Stakes, wherein A. G. Barlow’s good-looking
black, going out at 10 to 3, finished a length or
two ahead of Kenna (7 to l),Mars (7 to 1)
being about the same distance away. Ambas-
sador is a son of St. Anton, whose stock
improve with age, but the improvement in
this case was so sudden as to be startling.
Borrodale was not long in returning the
r>oo guineas which Harry Masterton gave
for him. Eight to one for the Rosstown
Plate, six furlongs, he jumped out smartest
and had them all chasing him vainly till
Creighton stopped riding him; Lucie Manette
(12 to 1) and Metellus (9 to 2) were second
and third, and the time —exceedingly good for
Caulfield —was lmin. Borrodale, who
is a 4-year-old gelding by Rossendale —Tink-
ling, is trained by Joe Hayward, who greatly
appreciated his change of luck.

One day last season a little jockey named
Edson moved a Canterbury Park (N.S.W.)
crowd to mirth by imagining his mount had
won, and acting accordingly, when the field
had another round to go. The lad has pro-
fited by his mistake, and at the same course
on Saturday applause was his portion instead
of rude laughter. Engaged to ride Spaghetti
in the Canterbury Handicap, he took his
horse to the front, slowed the field down
cleverly and came into the straight with a
lead which Laird o’ Cockpen and Blaircourt
fr.iled to reduce, though their jockeys tried
hard enough. Spaghetti, w T ho is a chestnut
gelding by Polycrates—Polverin, w T as favorite
at 9 to 2. Favorites were successful in five
of the 10 races, but the bookmakers took no
ricks with Killarney (10 to 9 on) or Gos-
hawk (9 to 4 on). In fact, they are invari-
ably cautious at Canterbury Park.

This Page’s impression that Sum King
would be very hard to beat in the Queens-
land Cup was borne out on Saturday. Con-
ditions suited the son of Comedy King—
Sumurun, for rain over-niglit had softened
the track, and he is partial to that sort of
going, as is his younger brother Amuse-
ment. High Syce, the Queensland Derby
winner, was a 6-to-4 favorite, a suc-
cess in the Prince of Wales Stakes
THE TIN HARE REACHES SALTBUSH TANK.
at w.f.a. having restored him to favor-
after his rather slovenly performance
in the three-year-old race; Sum King
was second favorite at 7 to 2, Snowman (8
to 1) and Trainer (14 to 1) being next in
demand. Old Feathernest, who has done a
heap of racing in four States —he won the
1923 Kalgoorlie Cup, was third in Lilypond’s
Perth Cup, fourth in Polycletan’s Metro-
politan, and second in Purser’s Caulfield
Cup—drew attention to himself by getting left
10 lengths and then running up fourth at the
mile, just behind Sum King. Five furlongs
from home Sum King was second to Lord
Eiffel, but at the home turn he came away
and the rest was easy. He won by a couple
of lengths from Canning Queen (25 to 1),
who beat the favorite by half a length; the
time was 3min. 31isec. Sum King is owned
by Mick Ryan, who is almost as well known
at Randwick as he is at Ascot, and was
ridden by Hill.

“Ike Mcßagg”: I note with grief, but no
surprise, that the Ring had another terrible
doing over the Melbourne Cup. Tommies, as
acknowledged humanitarians, are bitterly
opposed to war. How much keener must
the antipathy be when they reflect in their
ruined homes on the fact that, but for the
war, there would never have been such a
calamity as Trivalve! Just before Fritz
tore up his ticket, Cyklon’s dam, Cyanean,
was sold, with her colt foal at foot, to a
German buyer. Before the pair could be
transferred to Germany hostilities began,
and the British Government sold the mare
and foal as enemy property. Later, Cyklon
came to Australia, where he begat Trivalve,
and there you are.

"Eagle Farm" : As a result of the confer-
ence held in Melbourne, the rules governing
the race for the King’s Cup, the donation of
which was an incident of the Duke of
York's visit to Australia, have been announ-
ced. The cup, a gold one, will be presented
annually; the event will be a handicap with
fixed maximum and minimum weights—
9st. 51b. and 7st. Added money is to be not
more than £2OOO or less than £lOOO, thus
allowing for States where racing is not so
flourishing as in Victoria or N.S.W. The
race will be run annually in the following
order of States: N.S.W., Queensland, South
Aus.. Westralia. Tasmania and Victoria —
Vic. had its turn last year. The controlling
body in each State will decide place and
time.
l[! * * *
“Armstrong" : A Melbourne man has come
to light with a proposal for racing papier-
machg horses. The artificial noddies will run
on wheels, electrically propelled, but will be
ridden by jockeys of the usual type, who,
according to one account, will control their
mounts “by moving their arms back and
forward, just as when riding real horses."
Here, at least, the element of novelty
vanishes, for the arm movement, especially
that in the backward direction, is a notable
feature of our present type of horse-racing,
particularly at “the ponies.” However,
there may be something in the claim that the
sport will afford a new thrill. It is stated
that secret adjustments of the moke’s
mechanism make it possible to conceal from
the rider any indication of the ultimate
result. Under the old system it is almost
invariably necessary to take the boy into
one’s confidence, and that is sometimes
expensive.
* * * *
“0.P.H.”: Pony-racing and its gambling
and loafing concomitants were roundly de-
nounced in Vic. Upper House the other day.
The opportunity for condemnation was pro-
vided by a little bill that came up from the
Assembly (it was sponsored by ex-Minister
Goudie) proposing two race days a year for
Cranbourne, instead of one. Zwar, the man
from the North-East, set the ball rolling with
the declaration that hundreds of people on
the breadline wasted their money at pony
meetings. Keck, joining in, called it a cruel
and wicked waste of time to hold race meet-
ings of all kinds on an average of three
times a week all the year round. Richard-
son sneered at the miserable types that mas-
querade as racehorses at pony meetings
and scoffed at the idea of such competitions
improving the breed. Strongest of all was
President Frank Clarke, who has a liking
for racing for its own sake. While advo-
cating increase of stakes, and holding that
there was no harm in a man betting within
his means, he objected to 170 meetings a
year within 30 miles of Melbourne, many of
such a nature that one had to make careful
inquiries as to what horses were trying.
Every Monday, he said, 30,000 working men
refused work because they had to attend a
pony meeting, and on Wednesday 30,000
more did the same thing. How could Aus-
tralia hope to compete successfully with the
world industrially while that sort of thing
went on? Evidently Hogan’s Tin Hare Ret-
ting Prohibition Bill will go through the
Plush House like a bush-fire through a saw-
mill.
❖ ❖ $ #
“Ike Mcßagg”: It begins to look as if the
English Jockey Club is going to sanction
the introduction of the totalisator to ail
courses under its control, which means prac-
ticalLy every racecourse in Britain, including
those under the aegis of the National Hunt
Club, which looks after the winter lepping
events. The impression is confirmed by the
fact that the Times, no less venerable and
dogmatic than the Jockey Club, has endorsed
the club’s decision to have the betting laws
altered to permit the use of the machine.
When these two institutions agree their in-
fluence with a Conservative Government is
overwhelming. The Times goes even further
than the club, for whereas the latter sug-
gests that big and little starting-price shops
should be brought under the Betting Taxa-
tion Act, from which they are at present
exempt, the journal wants these shops to be
compelled to invest their clients’ money on
the racecourse totes. This would not only
automatically register the amounts invested
for taxation purposes, but would fix the
true starting-price. So it would, if the
totes-to-be provide for straight-out betting,
as well as “one-two-three.” Otherwise the
machine will be quite useless as a price-
fixer.
“Whitewall”: In spite of hard times and
high taxation, there seems to be a little
brass still left in Britain for well-bred stock.
At Doncaster yearling sales, 17 of the babies
which came under the hammer brought
45,980 guineas. Top price was 10,000
guineas for a chestnut filly from the Sykes
stud at Sledmere, where Sceptre was bred ;
the filly—it was bought by trainer F. Darl-
ing for Lord Dewar—is by Friar Marcus
from Honora by Gallinule from Word of
Honor by Saraband. Other good prices were
8500 guineas for a bay colt by Son-in-law
from Love Oil and 7000 for a brown colt
by Swynford from Salamandra. Seven other
youngsters brought over 5000 guineas apiece.
* * £
“Thormanby”: The 10,000 guineas paid at
Doncaster for the Friar Marcus-Honora filly
from the Sledmere stud has set the racing
statisticians going. The record price for a
yearling in Britain is 14,500 guineas, paid
for Blue Ensign in 1920. Even Amurrica
has to admit defeat here, the best over
there being 14,000 guineas, paid for a Hurry
On colt from Fatima. Fatima was bought
in foal to the English sire at .Newmarket,
sales, and was shipped to the States, where
the youngster was born a 100 per cent.
American. As Fatima cost only 720 guineas,
her owner made a pretty profit on her off-
spring. Frugal France lags far behind, the
highest price for a baby on that side of the
Channel being 7760 for Ukraine, a filly bred
by the Agha Khan.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Mike Flynn would appear to have sat at
the feet of the prophet Kilonis and learned
to apply the Greek’s methods to boxing. At
Leichhardt on Friday night Mike, scaling
Sst. 911 b., met champion Billy McAlister, two
pounds lighter, and did a lot of things that
are rightly frowned upon under Queensberry
rules, such as hitting with head and elbows
and using the “shamrock” blow. These
methods availed him not, for he was out-
pointed in every one of the 15 rounds, and
McAlister got a highly popular decision.
There was almost a “capacity” crowd.
* * * *
Scotland owns a good middleweight in
Tommy Mclnnes; and he is still only a
youngster. At the Sydney Stadium on Fri-
day night Tommy defeated Ted Monson,
■who is tough and awkwardly clever. Ted
made many gallant efforts to put the Scot
on the skids, but on every occasion his well-
directed punches only appeared to rouse the
fighting devil in Mac., whose continual
attack and absolute indifference to punish-
ment wore the Soustralian to rags. Ted was
on the canvas for nine seconds in the twelfth
round, only sheer gameness saving him from
being counted out. Mclnnes never slacks
up but makes a more or less tempestuous
rally of every tliree-minute session. Mon-
son was a very tired and battered boxer
long before the final bell relieved him of
further responsibility. It was a great scrap
for a very poor reward, the attendance
being, to say the least, meagre.
* * *
“Strangler”: The wrestling fraternity,
having used up Melbourne, has descended on
Sydney, with encouraging results to grap-
plers and management. Last Monday night,
when Kilonis wrestled a draw with Yokel,
the attendance w r as much greater than the
Stadium has sheltered at any boxing-match
held during the last six months. It is a
curious development, for Sydney has never
previously shown much interest in the mat
business.
* * * *
“P.R.” : It happened at a boxing tourna-
ment in the Speck. After going a few san-
guinary rounds, one of the contestant re-
fused to continue. Amidst a buzz of conjec-
ture he walked to the front of the stage and
explained the sudden cessation of hostilities.
“Genelmen,” he said, “the blankard bit me.”
There was a moment’s stunned silence, and
then the storm broke.

Phyllis, within a lifetime’s little span
I’ve seen you bound across the old divide
Between the things that might become a man
And those held decorous on the distaff side.
In these enlightened days you ride astride
And play, much as you please, the giddy goat.
One boon, but one, in Vic. you’re still

You may not take a ticket on the tote.
You puff the fag who once would flirt the
fan,
With scarce a trace of disapproval eyed ;
You run as never Atalanta ran ;
Upon the lawn where you were wont to
glide
At croquet, now you smash the ball that’s
skied
At tennis; in a Channel swim you gloat.
Withal—l wonder if it hurts your pride
Y r ou’re not allowed a flutter on the tote.
Your voice is heard among the horsehaired
clan
When points of law the learnhd courts
decide;
Your shingle (not capillary) we scan
Wherever pulse is felt or lancet plied;
You help your country’s destinies to guide,
You may be voted for as well as vote ;
r And yet—O tyranny unqualified !
You must not patronise the man-made tote.

Phyllis, unless some Galahad elide
This gross injustice to your petticoat,
You’ll have to make your bets where odds

What was, fortunately, the last match ot
the Stadium’s wrestling season was staged at
Melbourne on Saturday night between A)
Karasick (12st. 21b.) and Bill Meeske fl3st
21b.). The customary brand of exhibition
stuff, to which the crowd has at last awak-
ened, was indulged in, but even Karasick
was forced to smile at some of his attempts
to infuse a little seeming ferocity into it.
Repeated applications of the count -rom
the cheap seats kept the pair trying to look
vicious, but the acting was weak and the
crowd bored. Two falls (one to each, of
course) aroused ironical cheers. The decid-
ing fall went to the Aussie in round (. Loth
parties to the manoeuvre were egregiously
clumsy, but Melbourne has a short memory,
and perhaps the posturing foreigner will hnd
the game as lucrative as ever next winter.
To complete the programme Tiger Paym;
(12st. 31b.) was let loose on Charlie Chet-
wvnd (12st. 41b.). It was a rotten match,
for the black had settled the white with
ridiculous ease eight days before, and Chet
wynd was beaten before he got into the
ring. Val Quirk called the “Tiger off early
in the fourth infliction.
The Ins and Outs
“Tenth Slip” : With Gregory and Andrews
unable to make the trip to Brisbane, N.S.W.
will open the Sheffield Shield season on
Saturday under something of a handicap.
The batting, with Kippax, Jackson, Love,
Phillips and Morgan to lead it. promises
well, but the bowling outlook is not so cheer-
ful. Two young spin bowlers in Jordan and
O’Reilly have been included, along with
McNamee (who has not yet shown Ins form
of last year), Mailey and Everett. The
Queenslanders will be strong m both batting
and bowling; in lion Oxenliam the State lias
one of the most dangerous bowlers in Aus-
tralia on his day. If N.S.W. is going to
succeed this time —it won the first match
in Brisbane last year by 8 runs, and lost the
second in Sydney by 5 wickets —the batsmen
will have to do the business, unless ram
gives Jordan and McNamee an opportunity,
* ❖ * *
“Huflin-Guffin” : In country parts of Vic-
toria cricket is being so hard pressed by
tennis and other soft-ball games that it is
difficult to keep clubs out of the Insolvency
Court. One chib that I know is resorting to
an “art union” —under the lap, of course, as
“art unions” are not legal in Hogan s State.
It doesn’t sound like cricket. This modern
tendency to go in for tea-party games
which the girls play equally well is unpleasant
to an old-timer. There was something solid
about the country boy who played with a
hard cricket ball. I fear the effect of this
soft-ball stuff.
* * *
“Cross Keys”: Unless the authorities at
St. Peter’s College, Adelaide, change tlieir
minds, the school eleven will journey to Cey-
lon next month. The boys will play matches
against schools at Colombo and Kandy,
winding up with a game against a tea-
planters’ team. It is an unusual venture for
a schoolboy side, but such expeditions are to
be encouraged.
*;* * *
“Shrewsbury”: So the Board of Control
has invited an Indian cricket team to visit
Australia after all. It would be interesting
to know T what made the board change its
previously-expressed opinion that the Indian
players were hardly class enough for this
side. In point of fact, the Indians shaped
particularly well against Gilligan’s power-
ful team last year. Anyway, they have been
asked, so it is reported from Calcutta, and
an Indian Board of Control is being
formed at Bombay to make and take charge
of arrangements for a visit in 1928.
« * * *
“Rramall Lane”: Herbert Sutcliffe, who
recently had the captaincy of the Yorkshire
XI thrust on him, is reported to be jibbing
on the job, though he will not have .to take
over till he gets back from South Africa next
season —apparently the opposition of.someof
his fellow-professionals is worrying him. Wil-
fred Rhodes has joined Kilner and ’keeper Dol-
phin in publicly objecting to the committee’s
new choice, though the trouble with them
all is not so much that Sutcliffe is not
worthy of the job but that they themselves
are worthier. When one recalls that old
Tom Emmett, who was “as rough as bags,”
used to skipper the Yorkshire side without
anyone protesting, it is hard to see wlmt's
the matter with the intelligent and well-
mannered Sutcliffe. The young man made an
excellent impression wherever he went in
Australia.
Racquet and Bawl
“Cut Shot” : The selection of the players
to take part in the first Davis Cup trials, to
be held at Sydney on December 9 and 30, has
provided no surprises. Victoria is contri-
buting Patterson and Hawkes, Queensland
will send Moon, while Gar Hone and Rowe
are coming from S. Aus.; the N. S. Welsh
contingent will be Crawford, Hopman, Jim
Willard, Kalms, Cummings and Schlesinger.
Thorp will probably be some additions and
omissions from that list for the second set of
trials in Melbourne; Patterson and Crawford
seem to be the only certainties at the moment.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: The Australian tennis
heads are still sniffing round the question of
the amateur status. The other day a com-
posite N.S.W. and Victorian committee,
which is to supervise the tour of the French-
men and safeguard their morals, passed a
long regulation touching on the matter.
Briefly, no permission for the running of
any tournament or competition is to be
granted if a pro. is connected with it as
promoter or conductor. Players taking part
in such tourneys will be “outski’d.” A nasty
jar for someone, but one wishes to good-
ness the L.T.A. would steel itself to give a
clear-cut definition of what constitutes a
professional.
* * * *
“Malvern”: The 72nd series of tennis
matches between Victoria and N.S.W. will
be played in Melbourne on Nov. 25 and 26.
The N.S.W. side will miss Jim Willard in
the doubles, a department in which the Vic-
torians are strong; but as far as the singles
go the Cornstalks, with Crawford, Hopman
and Baker all showing good form, should do
well, The Mars Buckley Cup, won by
Victoria last May, is also involved. Vic-
toria has won 36 of these matches to 35 by
N.S.W. On present indications the Yarra-
siders should add to their score.
* * $ *
“Noah's Ark” : Spurred thereto, it may be,
in emulation of the tin hare, Rene Lacoste
has announced his invention of a tennis
MOTOR NOTE.
“DANGEROUS CURVES AHEAD!”
“robot” which will bang 10 successive balls
across the net at different angles. It can
be run by hand power or electricity, lie says,
and will put over a thousand balls in succes-
sion. It must be over 70 years since
Lord Frederick Beauclerk tried to institute
the perfect ground bowler at Lords in the
shape of a machine on the catapult principle.
The writer can remember a mechanical gad-
get, worked by strong levers and springs,
which could be set to chuck up several
varieties of bowling. This had its little day
in the early ’nineties, one specimen—it was
invented in England—getting as far from
its native land as Brisbane. The trouble
about it was that no one ever knew how
the ball was going to fly out of the mech-
anical fist, which never manifested a control-
lable grip.
“Hotham” : Harvey Malcolm, secretary of
the Australian L.T.A., which now has its
headquarters in Melbourne, has come back
from watching the Davis Cup contests in
America full of enthusiasm for Australian
tennis players. All the same, he seems a
trifle contradictory; while rating Hawkes
and Gerald Patterson as the equal of any
pair in the world, he predicts that France
will keep the Davis Cup for years. English
players, according to 11. M., are a poor lot;
they play a much softer game than Ameri-
cans and Australians, while the French arc
all for steadiness and good leugtli as opposed
to sheer pace. Betty Nuthall, whom we
have been taught to regard as a combination
of Venus Anadyomene and the young Diana,
with a touch of Suzanne Lenglen and Helen
Wills thrown in, did not so impress the
returned wanderer, who mentions that her
underhand service from a dozen feet behind
the line is the most notable thing in her
play and that she is “heavy on her feet.”
Another fond illusion shattered! Of the
Frenchmen, Boussus, who will be here
shortly, is a left-handed player, and quite
fit to be ranked with Borotra, although not
yet 19. He should trouble some of our
fellows, for high-class left-handers are as
rare in Australia as leading amateurs who
are not in the tennis goods business.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Hotham”: The Commonwealth G. C.,
which has its headquarters at Elsternwick
(Vic.), is the latest to decide on a new
club house which will be in keeping with
the club’s big membership and general im-
portance in the scheme of things. The new
building is to cost £12,500, and it is hoped
to have it ready in 12 months. The site of
the new nineteenth will be adjacent to, the
present .fifth green, which will*be constituted
the hour* green. This is as it should be, for
it is bordering on the inhuman to have a
long space separating the eighteenth and the
next, especially in, the burning Melbourne
summer or the freezing Melbourne winter, to
say nothing of the damp spring and the
wet autumn.
* % ❖ Hi
“The Trio”: The final event of the
Queenscliff (Vic,) Cup meeting, a Canadian
foursome over nine holes, will be discussed
over something with a stick in it for some
time to come. Three pairs tied, their score
being 31. Invited to play it out on the sixth
hole, 142 yards, they willingly consented,
with the result that all six balls found the
green, and each pair holed out in three.
They tried again, and the performance was
repeated. At the third attempt one pair
failed to get its three and retired, leaving
J. Long, a local player, and Dr. F. S. Jermyn
to oppose Maurice Vary and Tom Coleman.
Then there were two more ties, this time in
twos. Back to the tee went the players,
determined as General Grant said, to fight it
out if it lasted all summer. This time the
doctor missed by a narrow margin with the
first putt, the ball resting a few inches past
the tee, and Coleman settled the issue by
holing a 15ft. putt for two. Tom is the
man who hit the club house at Swan Island
four times in one day. One ball smashed
a window and holed out in a soap dish.
* * * *
“Divot Digger” : In laying down miniature
golf links on spare ground at the White City
courts area, the N.S.W.L.T.A. has done a
wise thing. A spot where a city dweller
can snatch an odd hour off for a little
putting practice or for trying out his capa-
city in the short approaches is bound to
appeal, and the White City is conveniently
situated. These miniature links are common
in London. The White City course is as
sporting as many larger ones, though the
game is much shorter. It is to be open to
members of the L.T.A. and non-members
alike. There is a hint for holders of waste
lands of small acreage in Sydney and other
Australian towns in this L.T.A. innovation.
It would cost far less to knock up a minia-
ture golf course than a batch of tennis
courts, and the revenue would probably be
a good deal larger, for the tennis-court
business for private gain has been overdone.
* * * *
“McLeura” : Katoomba (N.S.W.) is satis-
fied that a municipal golf course is a good
investment (B. 10/11/’27). Already in pos-
session of a nine-hole course, the council has
decided to add the other nine, and is going
to spend £BlOO on resumptions and improve-
ments. It is confidently expected that the
links will add considerably to the revenue of
the town, despite the fact that there are
clubs at Leura, Wentworth Falls and Black-
heatli, and one at Lawson in the making.
* * ❖ $
“Niblick”: Golf resembles chess in the
absorbed fanaticism which it awakens in
some of its votaries. I have just read-
ing about Dr. Tweddle, who defeated the
Speck’s Len Nettlefold —and all the other
starters —in the English amateur champion-
ship. On that occasion the doctor drove
more than one of his opponents delirious by
his exceeding deliberation in playing his
shots. In friendly games, when he makes a
bad shot, he begs his opponent’s permission
to put down another ball, and, if necessary,
another and another, till he eets his shot
just right. Meanwhile, perhaps, his fed-up
opponent has gone home, or finishes the
round in the dark and a state of hopeless
blasphemy. People like the doctor should
be restricted to playing alone. They usually
are, as soon as their idiosyncrasies become
public property; otherwise the sand bunkers
would be full of huddled remains, done to
death with a mashie or some other handy
weapon, there to lie hidden till chance
reveals that rude justice has been done.
* * * *
Tom Hunter has been appointed secretary
of the Brisbane G. C. He was hon. sec.
for 18 years and has been hon. sec. of the
State Golf Association since its foundation
in 1914. He has proved himself a golfer
of parts, too, having won the State cham-
pionship in 1913 and the foursomes cham-
pionship, in conjunction with W. F. R.
Boyce, in 1919, together with a host of minor
events.
Car and Cycle
“Buzz”: The run from Darwin to Mel-
bourne has been done so often, and by so
many different routes, that the feat itself
is becoming a weariness of the flesh, the
only saving grace being its value in proving
motor-car efficiency. It is difficult to com-
pare established records for the trip, but the
latest, by Allan Mackay and Barney Wood,
of Melbourne, in an Essex super-six, is prob-
ably the most meritorious to date. The
pair, travelling on a route leading from the
Territory through N.-W. and Central Queens-
land, and so by Bourke to Sydney and Mel-
bourne. covered 3465 miles in 6 days 3hr.
and 58min, British Imperial Oil provided
“juice” and lubrication.
* * * *
“Trembler”: Some remarkable mileages
were recorded in a recent Queensland petrol-
consumption test staged by the proprietary
running the Whippet car. The company con-
cerned has been holding tests in the various
States; the one under consideration took
place at Toowoomba. The winner was V.
Gilbert, who obtained 92.8 miles to the gal-
lon. while 15 competitors averaged 80 miles
to the gallon. More than that, the 352 com-
petitors returned a mean average of 54.15
m.p.g.. an extraordinary ratio of consistency.
The lowest on the list were three drivers
who got over 26 miles to the gallon. As
the drivers in the test were all bona fide
amateurs, driving their own cars for the
most part, it is evident that the standard
of amateur driving in Queensland is very
high.

AUSTRALIAN AGENTS: R. TOWNS & CO., SYDNEY.
“One Tree” : Hitherto the liill-climbing test
conducted by the Brisbane Royal Auto Club
has been held at Mount Gravatt, but this year
the steeper slopes of Mount Cootha, a muni-
cipal park overlooking the town, were
selected. There was the usual formula test,
based on weight of car, number of cylinders,
bore, stroke and so forth, together with
an unrestricted-speed test and an actual-
times contest. H. Horstman, driving a
Sports Alvis, came out on top in the com-
bined events; he won the formula and was
second in the unrestricted-speed class, with
another second in the actual-times event.
The first four places in the formula test
were filled by British cars.
* * * :!=
“Whizz”: Australian speedway experts
had better get busy tuning up. J. R. Cobb,
England’s premier motor-cyclist, is coming to
Australia on a year’s business trip, with
which he hopes to combine some racing.
Cobb has a lot of star performances to his
credit, but the last will do. It was the
winning of the Barnato Cup at Brooklands
on a Leyland-Thomas cycle; average speed,
121 m.p.h.

R. W. Lamb put the seal on his fame as
the best amateur road-cyclist in Australia
when he decisively won the Olympic test
race, thus qualifying to represent the Com-
monwealth at Amsterdam. The race was
lfeld in the Parramatta district over a 30-
miles circuit which had to be covered four
times. The roads were pool;, but the Vic-
torian, taking matters easily over the last
10 miles, won in 6hr. Smin. 14sec., J. L.
Gould (N.S.W.) being second in 6hr. 45min.
lOssc. It now remains for the authorities
to see that the absurd disqualification im-
posed on Lamb by the International Cyclists’
Union is lifted forthwith.
Miscellaneous
The Waratahs won their first international
on Saturday, beating Ireland at Dublin by
5 to 3—a try and a converted goal to a
penalty goal. The game was an heroic battle
between the opposing forwards. Ireland had
all the worst of the exchanges in the pack
and line-out work, but showed up finely in
characteristic loose rushes, while its deadly
tackling prevented more than one score by
the speedy Australian backs, some of whom
handled badly—a sure sign of staleness.
Wallace crossed for the Waratahs in the
first half, Lawton converting grandly; Ganly
contributed Ireland’s goal from a free, just
after the interval. Blackwood’s hooking had
much to do with Australia’s victory. This
was Ireland’s first meeting with an Aus-
tralian side, though it has met and been
beaten by both the All Black teams and the
Springboks.
sS * * *
“Inverleitli”: The Field (B. 3/11/’27)
is not alone in assuming an attitude ot
lofty disparagement towards the Wara-
tahs. London Evening News recently
remarked in a pained voice that the visitors
are “more virile than is necessary,” besides
being guilty of obstruction and “dangerous
kicking.” Other journals are holding forth
in the same vein. Yet these saifie censors
periodically go into raptures over the “mad-
man fury” of the Irish forwards or the
rugged methods of the Scottish vanguard,
with similar encomiums for the ivillingest
sections of Welsh or English sides. There
has never vet been a Dominion football side
in Britain that escaped criticism of the
Field description. One would not like to
say that this is due to their habit of win-
ning, but if the Waratahs lose a few more
games they may meet with a more con-
descendingly amiable attitude on the part of
newspapers which at present see no virtue
in their style of play.
* « s *
“Maunga” : I once saw a greyhound-and-
horse race under practically dead-level con-
ditions. It was to have been a four-furlongs
match between two gee-gees in training—
both fast over a short course, though not
in Gloaming’s class—but as they moved up
to the starting-post three fit greyhounds m
leash, owned bv a man at the winning-post,
joined in on the grass just inside the rails.
At the word “go” the five Quadrupeds broke
away even and went for their lives. At
150 yards or so one dog was leading slightly,
with the rest almost in line and all doing
their best. From then on the hounds were
out of it.
* * * *
“Billy the Goose”: I s’pose y’re supprised
at not ’earin’ of me before, but it’s a long
walk back ter Rocky fr’m Macquarie-street —
y’ know, I wuz tellin’ y’ I wuz after a goat-
racin’ concession there. Well, they didn
even leave me me traiD-fare. On’y fer a bit
o’ luck I ’ad rollin’ a drunk at Murwillum-
bah on me way ’ome, I’d ’a bin walkin’ yet.
Well, th’ goats is up ter putty, and they re
orl mad on th’ tin ’are. But jist as things
wuz bein’ fixed in ’ops the Guv’ment an tells
the Toms ter shut their bags up. So now
some uv us ’as put our ’eads tergether and
started a new lurk. It’s a tin kangaroo.
W’en we gives it a trial run the other night,
the talent reckons it’s just as int’restin’ as
th’ tin ’are, an’ the dogs seem t’ ’ave the
same opinion. Tin kangaroos ain’t tin ’ares,
an’ ’avin’ taken legal advice we’re goin’
ter give it a flutter with the bags open.
Even if it on’y larsts one night I reckon
that’ll pay me expenses up ter Cairns fer
the sugar season, an’ a man ’oo can’t get a
bit tergether up there when th’ cane gangs
an’ the mill ’ands is bein’ paid orf ort ter
chuck the perfession an’ go ter work.

“Don Crew”: Despite the usual precau-
tions, a mug will sometimes fluke the right
card in a “three-broad” game, but the bur-
toner to the occasion. Grab-
bing the mug by the arm he forces some
money into his hand. “I’ll go a quid with
you!” he’ll say excitedly. As the mug’s
attention is drawn from the game the card-
man re-gathers the broads. “All right,” he
exclaims, “if you two are going to bank
together I’ll rattle ’em out again.” When
lie rattles them out again the mug and his
money are parted for ever.

“Pheidip”: The Australian. Olympic
Council has at last begun to get its house
in order. A provisional itinerary has been
prepared, and H. A. Abbott, of Victoria, has
been appointed to select the track athletes.
The team will leave Australia on or
about May 5, reaching Amsterdam on July 1,
a month before the Games begin. The Aus-
tralasian championships at Wellington
(M.L.) on December 26. with the subsequent
Olympic tests at Sydney, should supply
every opportunity for weighing up-to-the
minu'te form.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: After a considerable
amount of friction between the diehard
amateurs and the other variety, the British
Olympic Association has finally decided not
to withdraw from the Games because of
the decision to permit payment to amateurs
for broken time. A strong protest against
the proposed payments has been filed by the
British body and endorsed by its affiliated
organisations; under shelter of this the
Briton will shed the light of his countenance
on the Games.

“Hoofian” : Whether the proximity of the
1928 Olympiad has spurred schoolboy
athletes to greater endeavor, or whether the
improvement is due to some other less obvi-
ous cause, it is remarkable how successful
the sports meetings this year have been.
In Sydney the doings of Carlton are too
fresh in the public mind to need repetition ;
in Melbourne, Davidson’s double —a high
jump of 6ft. ljin. and the hurdles in 16sec.
dead —was outstanding. At Duntroon, on a
slow track, the mile was done in 4min.
36 4-ssec., and the mile-and-a-half relay in
smin. 20sec. This relay is one event in the
Lafferty Cup competition, in which Sand-
hurst, Woolwich, Kingston (Canada) and
Duntroon take part; the time is three seconds

Spare Ped : Maonland is not keen on
continuing in the Australasian Amateur
Athletic Union. 'lt aspires to separate
representation on the International Athletic
Federation, considering it “beneath its
dignity” to figure thereon as a mere unit
of the Australasian union. Under present
arrangements, the Dominion gets a champion-
ship meeting about every 12 years, and this
is a legitimate grievance. Whether the
International Federation will relish another
addition to the flock of small nationalities
for which it has to cater and legislate is
another matter.

“Yarri”: The weekly event at Fossickers’
Flat was the arrival of the mail from “down
below.” Squatters and squatters’ emis-
saries mingled with the little crowd of. town
folk that waited on the footpath, sometimes

sented both N.S.W. and Victoria at

for hours; and they mostly had a sweep on
the time the mail-coach would reach the
post-office. The tickets were numbered 5,
5.110 and so on up to midnight. Sometimes
that wasn’t far enough, but the holder of the
nearest to the actual time won the sweep.
Once there was a dispute through the coach
breaking down and the mailbags being
delivered in a rabbit-poisoner’s cart. They
declared it “no race,” and all money was
returned.
*:* * * *
“Loom” : As a result of the visit of the
Maoriland University fobtballers to the inter-
state ’Varsity eight-oar race on the Nepean
River (N.S.W.), inter-Uni. rowing is to
be inaugurated on the other side of the Tas-
man. Sydney Uni. has been asked to send
an eight over during the long vacation, which
commences shortly. The idea is that the
visitors will meet a combined ’Varsity
crew in Auckland, and then journey south
for races at the various centres, returning to
Sydney in February. If the experiment
proves a success, an exchange of visits
periodically will doubtless follow.
“Slide”: Sydney’s “Henley” has not
attained the renown of its Melbourne rival,
but it will nevertheless celebrate its sixth
birthday on the Long Cove canal on Decem-
ber 3. Hitherto the has been held
in February, but the N.S.W.R.A. has con-
sented to the change of date so as to enable
larger and more representative entries to be
received. The banks of the canal are to be
enclosed this time. It .is quite the equal
as a rowing course: —at least for people who
like to see something of the race without
tears- —to the Victorian stream, and there is
no reason why rowing on it should not
increase in public favor. As it is, the races
held on the Parramatta and Lane Cove rivers
are losing popular support. To many spec-
tators the racing is invisible, and for those
who venture on the crowded craft which
cram the water conditions are even worse.
“Splash”: The Australian swimmers who
visited Japan have a story to tell which
is not encouraging to those who want a swim-
ming team to be sent to the Olympic Games.
They swam in fresh-water baths, the water
being of a temperature far lower than any-
thing experienced in Australia: but the
opposition, both Japanese and American,
would have been too good for our men in any
event. The Americans Crabbe, Spence and
Laufer, all probable Olympic candidates, were
seconds better than our own best, while
Takaishi must now be reckoned as a formid-
able rival to Weissmuller over the sprint
distances. This all goes to confirm the
opinion that, outside Charlton for the long-
distance events, we have no one worth send-
ing across to Amsterdam in the swimming
classes. It seems a queer position for a
country which not so long ago was in the
forefront of swimming; but these lulls in
achievement are inevitable in all sport.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Salesman”: People who ask the public
to give preference to Australian-made goods
don’t always practise what they preach.
I have before me an elaborate color-chart
issued by an Australian paint firm. It was
printed in America.

“Esters”: An English firm has been fined
for selling “port”-wine which w r as not a
product of Portugal. The incident empha-
sises the need for careful supervision of the
quality of red wines from Australia now being
exported in vast quantities. If it pays Eng-
lish blenders to put inferior foreign stuff on
the English market the trick may be worked
with Australian wines, unless precautions
are taken at this end. Years ago the market
for Australian wine in England was ruined
for a generation by the vending of fruity
chain-lightning as “a typical Australian
vintage.”

“Chancery Lane”: Obtaining particulars
for probate purposes from a widow, I
inquired whether her late husband had been
in business. “Oh, no,” was the reply, “he
was too honest for that.”

“H’roofa”: Re redgum furniture (B.
27/10/’27). About 17 years ago, Grundy,
a Brunswick (Vic.) sawmiller, showed a piano
in the A.N.A. exhibition with the following
sign:— .
This piano is made of common redgum, a timber
which in other countries is valued for its beauty
and worth. But
Later, the instrument was exhibited with
this addition: —
This piano was shown here four years ago. Any-
thing wrong with it?
As a barracker for Aussie timber, Grundy
ranks level with Martin Hannah.

“Verri”: Last season small shipments of
boneless veal from Maoriland were well re-
ceived in England. Recently, with the pro-
hibition on Continental meat on account of
foot-and-mouth disease, M.L.’s only serious
competitor, Holland, passed temporarily out
of the trade. Now the M.L. Agricultural
Dept, is urging the farming community to
prepare calves not less than three days old
for the slaughter-houses by feeding and tend-
ing the creatures with extreme care. The
inspection at the killing centres will be fol-
lowed by equally strict oversight in England.
It is hoped to establish a fine new industry,
in wdiich Australia may share. Hitherto
tens of thousands of calves have been
slaughtered annually in M.L. immediately
after birth.

“Comb” : The recent wool sales have seen
the most general competition for all types
of wool since the war. Not only has Rus-
sian buying had an effect on the market,
but France, Germany and Japan showed
no falling off in their demand, while Belgian
and Italian buyers also made their presence
felt. Moreover, America made its reappear-
ance as a keen purchaser of the free wools
which Yankee spinners like. Fine wools
and crossbreds were both buoyant, the latter
showing improvement. English advices state
that prices for comeback and fine cross-
bred tops have risen five per cent. With
the bumper clip predicted for the coming
season, the outlook for sellers should be
rosy. s
“Melos”: I have before me a number of
samples of artificial silk made from Aus-
tralian silky-oak, a wood which is steadily
making its way against imported cabinet
timbers. The silk is beautifully fine, and
lustrous ; to the layman’s eye it is quite as
good as the real thing. As the silky-oak is
a quick grower and hardy, landowners in
the warmer parts of the eastern coastal
districts, especially those with river or creek
frontages, might do worse than plant it in
odd corners. Along the banks of the Orara
(N.S.W.) years ago I noticed countless
vigorous silky-oaks raising their heads from
plain sand.
“Ledraw”: In good seasons gluts of
vegetables rob the grower of any hope of
making a haul. Australian canneries
should preserve this surplus in some of the
months between the fruit seasons. The
tinned product would have a ready sale out-
back, more particularly now that it is known
that the vitamines are not destroyed by the
canning process.
“G.8.L.”: It was recently asserted that
gold had been found at Canberra. Some
years ago a bit was obtained from a quartz
outcrop in the neighborhood of Tharwa, a
picturesque township on the Murrumbidgee.
near the western boundary of the Federal
Territory. A Queanbeyan business man
once showed me a bottle half-filled with
specimens taken from this outcrop. There
was some notion of forming a company, but
nothing came of it. Over 60 years ago traces
of silver were found by Fred Davis near
Belconnel, on a portion of Campbell’s Yar-
ralumla property.

STOCKINGS
Sydney held communion with its dead last
Friday. Another anniversary of the unfor-
gettable Armistice was with us; for two
minutes feet stopped hurrying, and the mind
emptied itself of all the crowding thoughts
of this urgent world, and spoke to those who
had in their self-sacrifice slipped into that
world whose time has broadened into eter-
nity. If the poppies worn by the thousands
in Martin-place had been cast on the ground
Hie avenues leading to the Cenotaph would
have been carpeted deep in crimson. The
crimson seemed to break in a great wave
against the city’s trysting-place with her
dead, and, surmounting the granite altar,
poppies woven into a rising sun seemed a
flowering credo in the Resurrection. The old
leaf-brown uniform, w 7 orn by men who had
scaled Gallipoli and had fought in France,
found its place before the Cenotaph. At the
far side of it were the blue and gold of the
Navy, and flanking it stood Boy Scouts
with bowed heads. Place and power were
there on a bunting-hung platform—vice-regals
and Premiers, and civic lords. But Armistice
Day is the people’s day, and to eyes dim
with that two-minutes’ inward gaze the
Governor, the Premier and the Mayor
were like vague figures seen in a dream as
they advanced to the Cenotaph and placed
their wreaths. Then rose the clear call of
the bugles, and slowly, silently came the
ceremonial of massing the flowers. Presently
from base to summit the memorial was car-
peted and curtained with blooms, each one
a heart-beat and a prayer.
The warriors of the 17th Battalion, which
is North Sydney’s own, decorated the War-
ringali Hail at Neutral Bay with th/eir
colors, black and green, for their yearly
Armistice celebration. The decoration com-
mittee achieved something in the nature of
a floral triumph with the stage, which was
a low trellis through which wistaria and
asparagus ferns twined and drooped. Above
this rampart glowing baskets spilled gold
and pink roses, and tall palms stood at
attention. Commanding-Officer Lieut.-
Colonel G. F. Murphy and Mrs. Murphy,
her black crepe de Chines flashing with jet
sequins, and Mess-President Major Boyden
and Mrs. Boyden entertained a party in
which were many colonels and more
knuts. Included in this group were the
Naval-Commander Leo Quick couple. Mess-
Secretary Lieut. N. W. Simpson, assisted
by his mother, was among the night’s hosts;
and others were Capt. Neil Browning, Lieut.
Colin Kerr, Lieut. Clive Neville and Lieut.
J. Baillie.
The gatherings of the English-Speaking
Union might be described as worthy rather
than gay. Even Dame Mary Cook’s hand-
some frocking of old-rose satin, its panels
lined with silver, failed to give an air of
abandon to the proceedings in Farmer’s on
Friday evening. “Let joy be twice refined !”
would seem to be the slogan of the great
union, and Farmer’s on a Friday night is
the correct atmosphere for decanting such a
decorous vintage. Literally hundreds
thronged the big rooms, and Dame Mary
threatened to be submerged by the wave of
welcoming femininity that surged towards her.
Her knightly Joseph fared better, probably
because his coat was not of many colors.
Henry Braddon, president of the union, sup-
ported by his lady in coral-pink and silver
trappings, bade the guests welcome, and
furthermore spoke of the work of the League
of Nations ; while the ex-Higli Commissioner
on this anniversary recalled London mem-
ories of Armistice night nine years ago.
Frances Alda, who is telling the world that
w r e are a loathsome people, has a beautiful
voice but a small, round figure which she
dresses as though it were as statuesque as
Clara Butt’s. She made up her mind not to
like anything in the country that first pro-
vided her with a crust, and from the very
hour of her arrival took the attitude that we
know simply nothing of the arts. She even
carried insult so far as to spell the name
of Arnold Bax when tw r o critics from Sydney
dailies were taking down her initial pro-
gramme. Hotels, theatres and railways all
came under the lady’s displeasure, and that
we bad no steam heat seems to have been
regarded as a personal insult. But the lady
was always capable of generating her own.
Even at tlie eleventh hour Premier Bavin
looked in on the Country party’s cheerio.
The gaiety of this shook the rafters of the
banqueting hall of the Australia midway
through last week, and as the House was sit-
ting it was a case of walk in walk out
for the Country members, who were the
important guests of the evening. However,
their wives and sisters and daughters kept
the bridge while the men of the family ran
the engines of State at full speed. (No
invidious reference this to joy-riding in Gov-
ernment cars.) President of the commit-
tee David Thomas welcomed one and all in
flowing speech, adding a, rider for the Par-
liamentarians that, though the rank and file
of the Country party didn’t expect much
from them for the first 12 months, after
that—well, he didn’t specify what the rank
and file expected, but it probably was an
extra bag of wheat and. three clips a year
from the sheep. Secretary Charles Coglilan,
Colonel C. J. Munro (general secretary) and
Mr. Farranridge were the busy hosts of a
crowded evening. Good-looking Mrs. Yal
Osborne, who helped in the entertaining,
wore black georgette splashed with red
beading. Ethereal pinks and silvers glowed
in Mrs. Earle Page’s raiment, and the rich-
ness of peacock-blue allied to gold lace was
in Mrs. Bruxner’s frocking. Mrs. Francis
clothed her slimness in black lace, and Miss
Buttenshaw was a froth of apricot georgette.
Following the fashion of the moment
among the English peerage and sneerage,
pretty Helen Anderson wore a wedding-
gown of mediaeval architecture. That is to
say, it ran from a square neck to a waisted
bodice, and thence downwards it was heavily
gathered all round, and wore its train
buckled by silver bosses just above the
waist-line at the back. It touched the floor
everywhere, was of ivory moires, and its
sleeves were fitting and wrist-long. From
under a Juliet cap of pearls flowed a soft
white silk-ninon veil, and a sheaf of white
gladioli and lily of the valley carried a
further suggestion of turreted tower and
moated grange. Sister Sheila ’maided in
ivory satins set to the same period, and
bound her hair with pearls entwined with
silver lace. Buck-hurst, the Double-Bay home
of Knight Robert Anderson and his lady,
housed both the ceremony and the wedding
feast; it was dressed in larkspurs and del-
phiniums for the occasion. The bridegroom,
by the way, was Gregory Blaxland, only son
of the medical Blaxlands, of Rose Bay.
St. Philip’s on Church Hill bloomed with
white roses and gladioli for the wedding
of Maude Inez Davies, daughter of Captain
Davies, of Point Piper. At the altar end
of the long aisle of flowering rose-trees the
bride breathed the usual vows, and had the
blessing of Canon Needham, of Grafton.
But no change of name occurred. The bride-
groom was F. L. Davies, of Point Piper, too.
Olga Palmer was the bridesmaid, and Petty's
Hotel spread the feast.
Manly was all the brighter for a pretty
wedding last week, when a life-long entente
was vowed between Kathleen Tarlinton,
once of Bega, and Luke McAlary, of Rae-
burn, Coonamble. The bride, who walked
in a froth of ivory-and-pink ninon and
tulle veiling, was given away by brother
Ernest and ’maided by sister Zita. The
cake was cut at the Pacific, where Mrs. Tar-
linton, in black and gold, had two attractive
girls to help her—Mollie McAlary, the
’groom’s sister, in blue and silver, and the
bridesmaid in her petal pinks.
Herewith May Moore presents Mrs.
Roland Foster, wife of Sydney’s well-known
singing teacher and herself a singer of note.
Mrs. Foster, who is just back from Europe,
was amazed by the excessive mannishness of
the London
woman and
t li e extreme
gentility o i
the men. She
and her hus-
band having-
gone on one
occasion with a
party to hear
some n e w T
o r dies t r a 1
work which
proved rather
uninteresting, a
young man on
the Austra-
lian’s right
moaned: “How
trulyterrible!”
Mrs. Foster
turned with a
glance of in-
quiry to an
elderly lady on
her left; and “B awful!” was the unex-
pected and emphatic verdict. Musically,
London seems flattened out, but Australian
singers make a hit with their audiences.
Ethel Osborn is going through the country
with Clara Butt and getting better notices
even than the great contralto. Rosa Alba,
Clifford Lathlean and Essie Ackland are
always well received. Dorothy Helmrieh re-
mains a favorite and George Brooke and
Teddy Cahill are simply regarded as the
Conquerors of Mayfair.
Period frocks were the feature of a Syd-
ney wedding last Friday night. This time
the bride and her maids sought their inspi-
ration from the girlhood days of \ ictoria the
Good. Marcia Stelzcr, eldest daughter of
the W. J. Stelzers, of Collaroy, mingled
Duchess satin and Chantilly lace in her rich
attire, which was finished off by a silver
train. Orange blossom and the usual mist
of tulle enhanced the picture. Five maids,
like a garden of sweet-peas in their mauve,
pink and blue spreading skirts, added color
to the wedding procession. The young man
who claimed the bride at St. James s was
Douglas Frazer Shepherd, of Randwick. The
bride’s parents staged the subsequent recep-
tion at the Cavalier.

Just now
B o o m oran g
II o use, i n
King-street, is
beautiful with
a collection of
Mr. M inns’s
works in oils
an d wat e r-
colors. This is the first time the artist has
broken out in oils, and before the pictures
were on the walls they were being bought
up, Mr. Garling bagging the first, a study of
roses, at 7o guineas.
An afternoon tented in blue and threaded
through with sunlight and the scent of
flowers was handed out by the clerk of the
weather for the first of two fetes at Gyiies-
bury last week. Those who have never been
inside the gates of the old garden around
the Albert Goulds’ home at Edgecliff have
missed one of the joys of Sydney. Once
a-top of the rock-hewn steps the other after-
noon the visitors entered on a vista of
shaven-green lawns, of spreading trees, of
the blue and sparkling harbor, its eyes as
innocent as if they hid no dark secrets.
Over all was shed a honeyed fragrance. No
sweeter, though, than actress Margaret Law-
rence looked on her Alpine-blue heels as she
declared the fete open. The lady was in
jocund pink georgettes, her dimples shaded
by a droopy pink crinoline; the heels before
mentioned were attached to white slippers,
of the type that Carmen wears as she skips
up and down the hills of Spain. All the
actresses Sydney loves were stall-holders.
Emma Temple was there presiding oyer the
lucky garden, with Leslie Victor to give her
a hand; Beatrice Day kept her white throat
from the day’s fervor with tulle cunningly
twisted into a bow, and in Quaker-like greys
was high priestess of the Arts and Crafts.
Her principal handmaid was Bowena Ronald
of the red-gold locks, who was radiant,, in
white and pink. Elsie Prince, gay as a bird,
rounded up timid and willing alike for her
houp-la stall. Tom Hughes’s lady, very hand-
some, looking like the cloud with a silver
lining in black lace over platinum georgettes,
was an important person in the proceedings;
so was that tried and trusty friend of the
G.R.G., Mrs. Lyster Ormsby, who divided
the responsibility of the tea-tent with Mrs.
Willis. A New York visitor. Mrs. Chariaire,
took moving pictures with the persistence of
a sleuth. The Actors’ Benevolent Fund
shares the afternoon’s takings with the
Girls’ Realm Guild.
The gardens of Eynesbury held a second
fete on Saturday, but the weather was not
so kind nor the attendance of buyers so
liberal. Just as new-Premicr Bavin’s lady
was making her opening speech a cloud like
a frozen hand slipped between the sun and
the earth, and not even the young pipers
from the Burnside Homes could put back
the Marcel into an afternoon which a cold
wind tore to pieces. The C, of E. Homes
at Glebe Point and Carlingford share the
booty. ,
Tenor Walter Ivirby, who gives two
recitals, one on the 17th, the other on the
18th, held court in the home of the William
Arnotts last Monday. About 70 lovers of
music found their way to the Elizabeth
Bay tryst, and here Walter sang both in the
flesh and in the gramophone. Among those
who listened were Mrs. Theodore, Mrs.
Arnott —very picturesque in hydrangea-blue
satins, and softjy-snooded white hair—Mrs.
Cameron (daughter of the James O’Grady
who governs Tasmania), Mrs. de Beaupuis
and her pretty daughter Mrs. Osborns. Poli-
tics were represented by May Matthews ; and
there wms an army of young singers whom
Walter encouraged by hearty bravos! A
clever girl, Miss Keys, .whose playing of
accompaniments was a miracle, proved to be
the composer of a song which, when sung
by the tenor, sounded as though it will soon
be a popular number on concert programmes.
Gwen Robson, looking somewhat pensive,
gave her farewell recital in the King’s Hall
last week. She has the talent and the phy-
sique for the life of a professional pianist,
which is about as strenuous a way of earning
a living as the up-to-date tennis star’s.
Further study is what she requires, and
she goes to Europe to seek it. Her
teacher, Gordon Lavers, must have been
proud of the young pupil he has never seen
when he heard her play Bach’s Italian Con-
certo. Schumann, Debussy, Chopin and
Liszt also found place on the versatile
musician’s programme. Robert Harper and
Mary Charlton were the excellent artists
who, out of their good nature, helped Gwen
with h.er concert;
The Institution for Deaf and Dumb and
Blind Children at Darlington will profit by
the successful cabaret of the week. The
Wentworth reverberated with the excitement
and clash of this party, and found itself
taxed to accommodate the whirling popula-
tion that inhabited its every nook and
cranny. A committee of 25 was responsible
for the success, and each woman proudly
wore on her summer frock her insignia
of office, a spray of daisies made by the
sensitive fingers of the afflicted children.
Four of the school’s pupils went about the
room peddling gay little kerchiefs, of which
they sold nearly 500. Darlington’s matron
was among the honored guests, and super-
intendent 11. Earlam and Mrs. Earlam, who
was president of the committee, were among
the afternoon’s hosts. Pretty Rowena
Ronald, looking like something escaped from
the nursery, was the star attraction.
In the shimmering, simmering heat of
Friday afternoon the Lyceum Club members
assembled in force in their rooms just
around the corner from Macquarie-street at
the bidding of Mrs. A. G. Thomas. The
fair, slim president was extending the wel-
come hand and the cup of kindness to new
members and old. But before Mrs. Lc-ish-
man, who looks after the Club’s commis-
sariat, did the ministering-angel act in long,
dangling topaz earrings, W. B. Yeats’s
“Hour Glass” was served as a thirst inspirer.
This was read in the beautiful mellow tones
of Gaston Mervale and Beatrice Day, with
Mrs. Moore and Mrs. Lowes as chief sup-
ports.
The £4O which came for the Harbor
tragedy relief fund from the North Sydney
“Orphans” carries a story. Some yachting
men used to meet for a sing-song, and they
so quietly accumulated numbers that it was
decided to form a settled organisation, have
regular social gatherings, and put aside
spare “bobs” for good causes. Someone
suggested that the association should be
called the Orpheus Club ; whereupon a sozzled
member rose unsteadily and wanted to
know why they should call themselves
“orphans.” The name was at once seized
upon. Since early-closing days the largely
grown Orphans have met in a hall in
Neutral Bay, accumulated 400 members, and
found it necessary to close their list.
The members gather once a month for their
smoke-oh with its usual concomitants of
beer, sandwiches and concert items; they
maintain a cot at the North Shore Hospital
and keep themselves systematically bankrupt
by voting their funds to the deserving public
appeal of the moment.
Mrs. George Taylor, the architect, is a
disciple of color, and she preached her gospel
at the Women Painters’ Club one afternoon
last week, illustrating her lecture with lan-
tern slides of English and American scenes
and buildings. Color as an irritant, a stimu-
lant and a deterrent was expounded with
such a wealth of detail that rows of inter-
ested women learned that pink may correct
the thieving youth, that red may be as flint
to steel and that blue has a restraining
effect (otherwise our bobbies might be
dressed in scarlet) and that flies hate it.
There must be a warm, motherly heart in
one lady in Sydney, whose adopted children
have been gathered in the strangest way
possible. Some time after her marriage she
was brought to disillusion and the know-
ledge that her husband had married her
for her money. She divorced him to enable
him to marry the other woman; and when
liis second wife died she appeared upon the
scene with an offer to take and care for the
two infant children. She, however, declined
his suggestion of a re-marriage. The ex-hus-
band, freed of responsibility regarding his
offspring, in whom he showed little interest,
soon forgot his sorrow and re-married. In
a few years he was again left a widower
with two young children on his hands.
Again the first wife came along with an offer
to care for the children; and she has them
now.
The whine of the vacuum and the sound
of the piano being tuned are making a fine
duet in the Royal Colonial Institute’s rooms
these days, for the end-of-the-year party is
in sight. It is dated for the evening of the
29th and eight o’clock is the hour. The
Governor and Lady de Chair will be present,
and his Ex. will present the prizes for the
institute’s annual essay competition.

The garden party at Stonington, post-
poned from Cup week, was held on a day
when the mercury climbed to 100° in the
shade, and a dust-laden wind made it feel
even hotter than it was. Garden and guests
looked a bit wilted, and it was diplomati-
cally suggested to the latter that the
Somerses wouldn’t be mortally offended if
some of them dodged the vice-regal hand-
shake and went round the side way into the
garden. Many took the hint, with the result
that they—and their host and hostess —got
into contact with cool refreshment much
sooner than otherwise would have been the
case. Lady Somers’s fawn georgette and
lace gown had a pink rose tucked in at the
waist-line, and a similar bloom nestled amid
the lace of her large hat. Her small daughter
played round in a blue frock with a wee
mushroom-shaped hat wreathed with tiny
roses. Feminine attire generally was "of the
light-weight order and chosen, apparently,
more for comfort than spectacular effect.
There were many frocks of floral-patterned
georgettes and chiffons, but fawn shades with
lace trimmings were most in evidence. Fancy
sunshades popped up everywhere, and one
smartly-frocked woman carried a brolly as
diminutive as those tiny things that were
fashionable accessories to the crinoline.
Lady Caroline Agar wore garnet-red piped
with silver, topped by a large vellum-toned
hat. The Irvine lady, who was accompanied
by the Chief Justice, was one of the few
who favored flowered millinery, her rose-
wreatlied hat blending with a fawn silk
gown, spotted with black. Sir Henry and
Lady Cowan, from England, were there, she
wearing a black-satin coat over a buff-colored
gown, her picture hat being crowned with
orange buds. Their daughter wore chiffon of
bois-de-rose tone with matching liar.
Mayoress Morel 1 was in a robe of coffee-
shaded lace and georgette. Mrs. J. J. Rouse,
of Sydney, was a study in navy and berry
red. Irene Vanbrugh looked dashing in
black, white and green striped silk, worn
with a close-fitting black hat. Prudence Van-
brugh chose navy blue with a bordering of
silver, and her black hat dangled many
feathers.
The racing at Caulfield on Saturday, not-
withstanding perfect weather, was witnessed
by a comparatively small crowd. The dress-
ing was not on the scale of splendor attained
on earlier days of the big carnival, though
many attractive figured and spotted dresses
were seen. Mrs. Clive Leonard, in the com-
mittee’s box, wore the new • canvas-cloth in
layender-blue, Phyllis Holmes Hunt made a
bright spot in red and white patterned
foulard and harmonising hat, and Mary
Winter Irving wore a collar and belt of
bright blue upon an eau-de-nil frock. Edna
Tabart was all in fawn tones, and her mother
wore a prunelle-liued dress with a small liat
trimmed with flowers of the same shade.
Mrs. Russell Gabb’s cherry-and-white figured
\oile was topped by a speckled straw hat.
Mrs. E. M. Pearce and Mrs. A. Woolcott
and her daughter Francie were other good
features on the lawn.
Armistice Day saw the laying of the foun-
dation-stone of our National War Memorial.
Lord Somers was master-mason for the occa-
sion. The site of the building has been
well chosen and commands a wonderful view,
which even the heat and haze .of last
Friday couldn’t quite obliterate. The cost of
the edifice will be £200,000 or more, and
the amount in hand is £70,000. The cere-
mony was watched by thousands. War
widows and war-bereaved mothers proudly
wore the medals of their dead, and ex-service
women were there in full force. There was
•fftle military display, the Governor setting
an example by displaying his decorations on
the breast of his frock coat.
Later in the day at the Church of Eng-
land Grammar School Lord Somers per-
formed a similar ceremony, setting in place
a stone of the memorial hall that is to com-
memorate the war service of the school’s old
boys. Lady Somers, Mayoress Morell and
Lady Agar were present at both ceremonies.
Sales of poppies on Armistice Day were
good. Disabled Diggers and their dependants
fashioned the crimson blossoms, of which
71,000 were purchased. Orders for wreaths
numbered 800, and it is anticipated that
returns will amount to close on £2500.
The carnival afternoon in aid of the
Melbourne and East Melbourne Auxiliary of
St. Vincent’s Hospital, postponed from Cup
week, was held at the Green Mill last week.
and gathered a very handsome harvest.
Mrs. Merson Cooper, the president, who
wore navy georgette with a mushroom-shaped
hat. supervised all arrangements. Ten well-
known jockeys, wearing their racing silks,
rode mechanical horses in the Charity
Stakes; artists of the Firm, the Italo-Aus-
tralian Opera Co. and the Tivoli Theatre
gave of their best; and Beppe de Vries arid
Frank Biddy sold autographed photographs.
In the Dutch garden stalls of all sorts did a
thriving trade, and fortune-telling booths and
guessing competitions helped the cause.
-There was jazz and bridge, too, and afternoon
tea. The lion, secs., Mrs. George Bowcher,
in white and blue-spotted frock and large blue
straw hat. and Nina Glass, who had gold
thread embroideries on a bois-de-rose gown,
exchanged smiles of satisfaction.
A very young bride occupied the centre
ol the stage when Malvern’s new Town Hall
housed its first social function. Elizabeth
Dcuglas Coutie, daughter of the city engi-
neer, had just married Keith Ballantyne in
the chapel of Scotch College, and at the sub-
sequent reception there were several hundred
guests. The curator of the Malvern Gar-
dens’ (Mr. Reeves) sent the whole of his
hot-house treasures of orchids, azaleas and
begonias (in tubs) to mass along the stairs
ana corridors and adorn the rooms.
Beneath arches of pink and white heath,
Marjorie Maseatte _ Robins floated up the
aisle of Gardenvale s kirk on a recent even-
mg, and became the life partner of Henry
Rothe McKeown, of Caulfield. The bride,
an only daughter of the T. W. Robins couple
ot Sevenside, Gardenvale, looked out from a
cloud of ivory gejqrgette glistening with
crystal, and a train of pink and silver
rustled behind. Bunches of orange blossom
decorated the veil of Limerick lace, and a
posy of water-lilies and lily of the valley
was carried. Doreen Cowan and Zetii
lannis, as attendants, exhibited taffeta liip-
bows on frocks of peach-tinted georgette,
and a rose peeped out from the brim of their
crin. hats. Mrs. Robins received the com-
pany at No. 9 afterwards, clothed in a
smart black and pink toilette.
An engagement announced last week was
that of the fair-haired Elsa, daughter of Mrs.
Andrew and the late Dr. Frank Andrew, of
Kooyong. The bride-elect is a clever little
amateur mummer who made her social debut
this year at the State Government House hop
in honor of the Yorks. Her prospective hus-
band is Andrew, third son of Captain and
Mrs. Percy Chirnside, of Brandon Park.
Oakleigh.
( The fashionable and expensive Victoria
Golf Club, which is a purely feminine
affair, threw over its principles on Saturday
night when it warmed its new clubhouse
with a dance, to which many mere males
were bidden. Some members regard this
as the thin end of the wedge.
From beneath the smart hat depicted here
looks out the bright face of Countess Filippini
who, before her marriage to the Italian
operatic artist Count Ercole Filippini, was
Nance McPar-
land, of Syd-
ney, a student
of St. Vin-
cent’s College,
Potts Point.
She holds the
B.A. degree of
Sydney Uni.,
but decided
upon a vocal
career, lx e r
teacher being
the singer
whom she
married. Mov-
ing to Ade-
laide with her
husband sh e
helped to
form the Italo-
Australian
Grand Opera
Company, a
combination
which is giving opportunities to several
young and talented Australians. Soon after
the venture started the Countess took up the
conductor’s baton to tide over an ' emer-
gency, and proved so capable that she has
held the job ever since. The picture is by
Ruskin.
Our younger set, growing weary of the
stage, is now turning its attention to the
screen. It is proposed to make a picture
dealing with the doings of Robinson Crusoe.
Western port Bay is to provide the background,
and the party will camp there during the
holidays. Ray Whiting will be in charge of
the operations, and a dark lass from Ivooyong
whose Ilollywooden yearnings have been
checked by the family will be the castaway's
principal temptation, aided by a bevy of
friends in scanty native attire. The result
will be screened in the cause of charity—
which is called upon to cover more than
clothes do in these days.
The British war film “Mons” was screened
at the Uni. public lecture theatre the other
night as a prelude to an attempt to form a
Film Club. Prof. R. S. Wallace, who is
one of those responsible for the proposal.
explained that the idea was to have a weekly
screening of selected E.itish and Conti-
nental films —a sort of cinema repertory
movement to wean public taste, away from
the puerilities and vulgarities of the Ameri-
can film. The use of a theatre for the
purposes of the society has been promised by
a sympathetic theatrical firm.
At the New Gallery last week many
French people, as well as Australians, had
the first glimpse at a show of prints, etchings
and engravings by French artists. Consul-
General for France Rene Turck, who made
the opening speech, explained that when
lately in France he was asked by L’Associa-
tion Frangaise d’Expansion et d’Echanges
Artistiques whether an exhibition of French
paintings would find favor in Melbourne. He
encouraged the idea; but with an eye on the
heavy Customs duties on imported originals
it was decided to confine the exhibition to
reproductions. The trustees of the National
Gallery purchased a hundred of the exhibits.
Madame Turck’s navy-blue frock with
pleated skirt was worn with a jumper of
lacquer-red embroidered in gold and blue,
and a small red straw hat. Her daughter
Ninette was in strawberry-colored crepe de
Chine, with collar and cuffs of faint pink
muslin and val. lace and a harmonising hat.
The Maudsley lady, Mrs. H. 1,. Wilkinson
and American Consul-General Garrels were
others who gave the show their approval.
Here is Mervyn Napier Waller, a Vic-
torian by birth, who is making a name as a
mural decorator, despite the fact that he left
his right arm
in France dur-
ing the 1914-
18 disturb-
ance. He has
trained h i s
left hand to
do all an d
more than his
right h a n d
could formerly
accomplish. In
1.913 he was
one of tli e
most promising
students of the
National Gal-
lery, and won
all the prizes
he was eligible
to compet e
for. His bent
at first was
towards purely
decorative
compositions. Then he dabbled in woodcuts,
and finally found that wall decorations gave
the widest scope for his talent. Some fine
examples of his work adorn the celebrated
bar of Menzies’ Hotel, and he is responsible
for the design of panels in the new Town
Hall. He is now at work on designs for a
frieze for the staircase of the Public Library.
Lima Roach wore pale pink linen, eyelet-
embroidered, with a harmonising straw hat,
at the opening of her show of woodcraft. The
exhibition comprises boxes for gloves, cigar-
ettes and other small articles, book-ends and
vases decorated with bits of Australian land-
scape and purely decorative designs—attrac-
tive Christmas gifts for friends at home or
abroad.
Sir Harry Cowan and his lady were
entertained at afternoon-tea at the Mia Mia
last week at the invitation of the Colonial
Institute and the Victoria League, which
joined forces for the occasion. Lady Cowan
said a good word for British cinema films,
and condemned American film corpora-
tions in Australia for keeping John Bull’s
productions off the silver screen. Medical-
knight James Barrett, as president of the
R.C.1.. welcomed the overseas visitors, and
Mrs. J. S. Fraser, senior vice-president of
the Victoria League, echoed his words of
greeting.
Jones, Minister for Works, has caused
quite a flutter in society dovecotes by sug-
gesting that 15 or 17 acres of the 50 acres
comprising Government House grounds. St.
Ivinda-road, should be set apart for a State
Government House. For about £30,000 or
£35,000 he thinks that a bungalow or
“dower house” could be put up suitable for
a Rubber Stamp with £5OOO a year salary.
The Argus and some of the Conservative-
Liberal members of the Assembly profess
to. be horrified at the State Government
being made so obviously a second-fiddle
player to the G.-G., who would be living in
the big house in the other 35 or 33 acres
as his neighbor for about three months a
year. On the other hand it is hard to find
a suitable place to rent. At present £2234
a year is paid in rent and municipal rates
for Stonington, Malvern. That amount
would be more than sufficient to pay interest
and sinking fund on the sort of State-owned
shack Jones suggests. The upkeep of Ston-
ington also has been a charge on the State.
Jones is a good business man, and by threat-
ening to build he may get a better caboose
than Stonington at a lower rent.
Mary Lindsay, the late Baronet Rupert
Clarke’s sister, is doing her bit to adver-
tise Australia in London. On her last visit
here she acquired an estate in W.A. on which
she proposed to settle with her brood and a
bunch of transplanted English neighbors.
Ihat fell through, and she is now asking'the
Westralian Government to provide a gift
ranch for the Yorks, on the lines of the
Canadian farm of Edward P. So'far there
isn’t much response.
Mrs. Tom Patterson, Melba’s sister, is
busy shopping to fit out daughter Mary.
Auntie Nellie is taking her abroad, and
intends to present her at Court and make a
fuss of the girl, who has just left school.
Melba’s god-daughter Nellie, an elder sister,
had her trip to the Cold Country and debut
a year or two ago. These two Patterson
nieces were assistants-in-chief to Melba when
the Dame acted as cook at her country-
house party. Melba invited all the Con.
girls to Coombe Cottage and prepared the
tucker herself, donning a chefs cap for the
occasion.
The new overseas guest at State Govern-
ment House, Lady Caroline Agar, would
almost pass for Lady Somers’s twin. She
is an all-round sport, and Australians will
like her for that.
Beatrice Sharwood, the first woman doc-
tor to put up a brass plate in Canberra, is
the daughter of our Crown Solicitor, and the
eighth medico to start practice in the national
capital.
A large circle of friends is mourning Mrs.
Sarah Rowan, over whom the grave lias just
closed in Melbourne cemetery. She outlived
by more than a decade her husband, who,
towards the end of last century, was a part-
ner in. the Collins-street drapery firm of
Moubray, Rowan and Hicks. When Aider-
man Moubray, one of the other partners,
was an outstanding figure in the City Coun-
cil, the Rowans were among the crowd at
social functions hold at the civic centre. For
more than 50 years the family homed at
Haw-Hawthorn. Of 13 children three sons
and three daughters survive. Mrs. Rowan's
side of the family, the Nihills. has supplied
two or three units to the medical profession
in Melbourne.
Varied fare was provided at the Chamber
concert of the Musical Society, held at the
Assembly Hall the other evening. Ada Free-
man’s pianoforte playing was the outstanding
feature of the Mendelssohn Quartette in C
minor, Bertha Jorgensen, Dorothy Roxburgh
and Tasma Tiernan supplying good string
support. The Brahms Trio for clarionet,
’cello and piano was presented by pianist
Rita Hope, Franklyn Stoneham and Tasma
Tiernan. Biddy Allen contributed piano-
forte works of Schubert, Granados and
Debussy; and Muriel Campbell’s fiddle was
heard in items by Saint-Saens and Dupont.
Leonora Scott and John Hobbs were the
singers of the evening, accompaniments being
played by Ida Scott and Emilie Davis.
The rays of a roscate-shaded tall lamp fell
on the fair bobbed head and pink frock of
Edith Ilarrliy (Mrs. Daly) when she gave
her recital at the Assembly Hall one night
last week. The lady showed her versatility
by filling successively the rbles of solo-
pianist, singer and accompanist in a pro-
gramme mostly made up of her own com-
positions. There was a rich floral reward
for the recitalist, and violinist Gertrude
Alger and baritone Arnold Ashworth, who
assisted, had a good reception, too. In the
large audience were Edith Harrhy’s husband,
Beckx Daly and his mother, John Longstaff,
Mrs. Percy Blackbourn, the C. B. Moores
and daughter Doris, Kitty Gleeson and Mrs.
Poll] man.
Members of the Alliance Francaise enter-
tained their vice-president, Madame Alber-
tine Gay, at dinner at Cockerton’s cafe on
Saturday night, the occasion being her re-
turn after half a year’s sojourn in Europe.
Consul-General Turck welcomed the lady,
and after dinner there was dancing. Madame
Turck was in mauve georgette 'with self-
toned embroidery. Madame Gay was robed
in. glistening black and silver sequins, and
her fine-looking daughter also chose black
with silver.
The Italo-Australian Grand Opera Co.
wound up its season in something approach-
ing a blaze of glory. “Carmen” was by no
means the best production of the series, but
there was a big and appreciative audience.
Flowers a-plenty were passed up to Carmen
(Elsie Woolley) and other principals.
Countess Filippini, holding armfuls of blos-
soms, spoke optimistically about the forma-
tion of a National Opera Company.
Some notes from Canberra:
The Stonehavens arrived from Melbourne on Friday
in time to take part in the Armistice celebrations.
The dazzling- November sun threw the white Parlia-
ment House building into sharp contrast against the
brilliant green background of Capitol Hill. All
wheeled traffic along the main avenues was stopped
at 10.30 a.m., and at eleven the two minutes of
silence were announced by the power-house siren.
A little later the Last Post cut athwart the stillness
with dramatic effect. The ceremony was attended
by all members of Parliament and most of the resi-
dents.
Mrs. Lane-Poole, to whose credit stands the fur-
nishing of Government House, Yarralumla and the
Prime Minister’s Lodge, paid us a flying visit last
week, arriving on Friday in time to attend the
Armistice ceremony and leaving next day.

way of saying, "I
want a first-class wine of
good vintage at a reason-

Brisbane.
Mr. and Mrs. Amery are rushing about
Queensland, staying a few hours here and
there, including Government House, but
mostly sleeping and dining on trains. A
joke against the railway was that the beauti-
fully-polished and manicured locomotive that
was to draw the distinguished visitors from
the border was somehow overlooked, and the
shabby, old everyday toiler was attached
to their train. However, some startled
official recovered the resplendent engine later.
His Ex. and Lady Goodwin have been to
the Ascot races with Colonel and Mrs.
Campbell. Lady Goodwin wore marine blue
and a navy hat, and Mrs. Campbell was in
cornflower blue with biscuit-toned millinery.
Mrs. TuUy, in china blue and white, and
Mrs. Cecil Palmer, in ivory, were with the
v.-r. party. Mrs. Isaac Moore gave the
Goodwins tea on the committee verandah.
Mrs. C. E. Sligo was in leaf-green, Mrs. Wil-
liam Bulcock in beige lace, Naera Sampson
in cornflower blue, Mrs. Arthur Clark in
ivory and blue, Leith Graham in Wedgwood
blue and white, and Mrs. Carvosso in navy.

-The Lyceum Club gave an evening for
eight Brisbane writers —Emily Bulcock,
Llywelyn Lucas, J. M. Stevens, Mrs. Con-
geau, Alice Gore-Jones, Miss Paten, Mrs.
llamlyn Harris and Mrs. M. Forrest. Ex-
tracts from the work of all the writers were
read. Mrs. Firmin McKinnon presided, and
posies were presented to the guests of honor.
Amongst the throng were the Philp lady,
Daphne Mayo, Mrs. Amos and Mrs. Lowson,
and there was a large gathering of members.
Passed out this week, Gilbert Wilson, born
at Bannockburn. He was one of thos e who
retained the courtly manners of the old
school. Ilig widow is well known as the
soprano. Her mother was a Caraudini, and
slie inherits the silver voice of five genera-
tions of singers. She is still a very hand-
some woman.
Though “Rose Marie” opened her box of
joys in showery weather, there lias been a rush
tor seats, and the season has been extended
from a fortnight, to a month. At the Empire
Hie O’Brien Girl” holds the house, and the
Repertory i s staging “Old English” under
the eye of pretty Nell Douglas-Graham, Bar-
bara Sisley follows with “The Blue Bird.”
The Shakspeare Club had its last evening
oi the season in the Women’s Club rooms.
Mrs. .Cumbrae-Stewart and Mary Sydes
arranged the programme. Eric Smith 'and
Lditli Ho watt gave a duologue from
Anthony and Cleopatra,” and Mrs. Cum-
brae-Stewart spoke on Egypt’s naughty
queen and her time The Douglas-Grahams
Hancocks and Tr-tters were there.
The Russells had a ball at Jimbour House
to. help the Dalby ambulance. Despite the
rain about 1000 people came in lorries, cars
and by special train. There was a Paddy’s
Market, a brief sports programme and stalls
all round the big garden. At night a special
tram brought the Blue Bird orchestra and
dancers from Dalby. The afternoon alone
yielded a return of £200.

Hobart.
The O Gradys went to Devonport to open
the Show and attend the dance in aid of the
hospital. Brilliant weather helped to make
the Show a great success, there being a re-
cord result financially.
The South came out on top in the North v.
South tennis matches, which were played ori
the Association Courts at Newtown in superb
weather. The Northern players were not up
to their form of last year, when they beat
the South in three out of five divisions. Mrs.
Bond and Miss Richardson, in the ladies’
A grade, proved invincible.
The Amateur Horticultural Society’s rose
show in the City Hall was a thing of delight
to eye and nose. Other flowers were shown,
the new antirrhinums and gladioli makin"
masses of lovely color; but the champion
award went to an old-fashioned bloom, a
Dean Hole rose grown by J. L. Robertson.
Members and guests of the Hamilton
Literary Society had a dip into Hobart’s
early history when they honored the hon.
sec. and hon. treas. with a presentation of
books at last meeting. Miss Chapman has
been the society’s quill-driver since its
foundation by Lady Hamilton 38 years ago,
and Miss Downing, the treasurer, has many
years of good service to her credit. A paper
was read giving an account of the ball given
by the captain and officers of the Erebus and
Terror, in 1841, before their start on the
South Polar Expedition, supplemented by a
letter in which one of the ladies present —
she was a young girl then—described the
affair with many little characteristically
feminine touches.
Armistice Day was observed in Hobart
by a military celebration in front of the
Town Hall and the sale of poppies in the
streets.
The annual State conference of the Bush
Nursing Association was held in Launceston
lately, and a fair number of interested
Hobart people journeyed north for it. Among
the southern delegates were Mrs. Stourton
(president), Mrs. W. F. Darling and Mrs.
F. T. Baxter.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Adelaide.
This has been Melba's week —the opening
of the new wing at the Queen’s Home, an
English-Speaking Union reception, her con-
certs, and a host of private engagements
that included a luncheon given by Mrs.
J. W. Cowell and a visit to the Heysens at
Ambleside. The diva has been the guest of
the E. W. Holdens at Deque,tteville-terrace,
but Mrs. Armstrong and Pamela and the rest
of the party put up at the South Australian
Hotel. The Queen’s Home opening fell on
a day of blistering heat, and the Dame wisely
cut her speech short. The new wing brings
the total cost of the buildings up to
£22,500, and the committee is asking for
contributions towards the £5000 unpaid.
The president, Judge Parsons, and the
president of the reception committee, Mrs.
C. R. J. Glover, did the honors at the
E.S.U.’s party. Melba was in black and
silver, topped by a cream-and-gold coat, and
her daughter-in-law was in sapphire blue.
Rita Callow, tall and slender and pink-clad,
was busy greeting old friends after her three
years away, and the luck they wished her
came her way at the opening concert. She
sang as prettily as she looked, and got a
reception almost as warm as Melba’s own.
For the concerts the Exhibition Building
was packed, and Melba, in white crepe de
Chine a-shimmer with rhinestones, had such
a greeting as would thrill any woman’s
heart. She sang, and sang again; said a
brief word or two; wound up with “Home
Sweet Home” to her own accompaniment:
tossed a kiss to her clamoring audience and
took away with her sheaves of flowers, some
from shy pupils of the M.L.C. (a white-clad
bevy of them nearly filled the platform), a
huge cluster of gladioli from Margaret Hol-
den, and a heap of baskets and bouquets and
home-made bunches.
A committee headed by Mrs. Herbert
Rymill has staged another dance for the
Ivooyonga Golf Club’s furnishing fund. The
club rooms were all a-bloom with rhododen-
drons (masses of them, and as lovely as
though there’d never been a whisper of
drought) and roses, larkspurs and sweet-
scented broom. There was bridge for non-
dancers, an admirable floor for the jazzers
and a muster of members big enough to give
the fund a substantial lift.
WESTRALIA.
Perth.
Governor Campion is entering upon his
busy season and gets through a formidable
weekly list of engagements, opening fairs,
fetes and bazaars and attending various
entertainments. It must pall a bit at times,
but bis genial smile endures.
The marriage of Mayor Franklin’s grand-
daughter to Alan Stapleton was made quite
a civic event. The pretty bride was
attended by three maids of honor with little
Jeannie Brockman as train-bearer. The
supper-room at the Town Hall saw the
after-rejoicings, and the triumph of the feast
was a three-tiered bridal cake made by the
bride’s mother and iced by the bridegroom’s
sister.
A wedding of interest to old Sandgropers
was that of Dorothy Lee-Steere, of Moora,
and Malcolm Roberts. The bridegroom is a
grandson of one of the pioneers, Edward
Roberts, of Yatheroo station, Dandaragan.
“Bobs” Allen, another grandson, recently
linked his fortunes with those of Hilda, of
the Donovan clan. Both weddings were
attended by crowds of old settlers, who
reminded each other of things that happened
in the long, long ago.
Pretty Sheila Durack, who will be Mrs.
Reg Suminerhayes by the time this Letter
sees print, has been feted and partied here,
there and everywhere. Mrs. Carew-Reid
organised a smart affair at the Karrakatta
Club, and there have been many gift teas.
Now that spring is giving place to summer
the croquet, tennis, yachting and bowling-
clubs are opening their seasons in the
usual gala fashion. One of the smartest
affairs of the kind was staged by the King’s
Park Croquet Club. Mrs. Edith Cowan said
the opening words.

A Mother Goose fair held in the Perth
lown Hall by Mrs. M. Padbury and others
associated with the Y.W.C.A. was a most
successful effort. The Mayoress, Mrs. .T.
T. Franklin, broke a golden egg by way
of opening ceremony. Each stall ' repre-
sented a nursery-rhyme, and sales were
brisk.

THE INKY WAY.
“P.X.” : ,T. T. Lang (he was Premier o i
N. S. Wales in the Dark Ages) was furious
with Bavin and Boyce when they decided
not to prosecute the S. M. Herald people,
including Cutlack, of the editorial staff, for
writing and publishing the Piddington
article which the foolish and futile Commis-
sion inquired into. It was worse than foolish
and futile to start the prosecution, and
Lysaglit, who presumably authorised it,
spattered what little reputation was left to
him for level-headedness. The Commission hav-
ing been appointed, the Herald people went
into the box and in the frankest possible way
told avllo the writer was; and the writer
was also frank enough to confess that one
sentence at least might have been better cast.
Then, these and other admissions having
been made before the Commission, proceed-
ings for criminal libel were started. The
Government that could follow up a Royai
Commission inquiry in that way must want
to silence every witness before every other
Royal Commission.
“Hotham”: The annual meeting of the
Melbourne Herald proprietary was told that
the big Flinders-strCet combine has had an
extra good year. Having swallowed the
Morning Post recently, the tiger is sitting
back, complacently licking its chops, and pre-
pared for all eventualities. It almost seems
annoyed because at the moment there don’t
seem to be any eventualities to try its claws
on.
“Murkah”: The Bulletin undertakes
more contracts than it dreams of for the
“pin-money freelance.” Take my own case.
A cable-radio argument early this year, and
incidentals, enabled me to get the water laid
on. It was just in time, for a six-months'
drought ensued. Another “draw” fenced in
an acre of garden. Most of my gramophone
discs should be marked “With compliments
from 214 George-street.” Now I’m after an
ice-chest. P.S. —For Heaven’s sake print this.
The wife wants it by Christmas and there’s
only a lap to go.
“Laz”: May I add to those gems of Par-
liamentary diction preserved by a N.S.W.
gallery-hand (B. 3/11/’27) a few from a
Victorian press shorthand book: —
He has produced enormous herds of cattle and
sheep out of his own pocket.
This white elephant is a bottomless abyss that
must be made to stand on its own feet.

“Spare Sub” : To flatly deny the accuracy
of a newspaper interview has ceased to be
an easy way of escaping the consequences of a
loose tongue, as Labor’s Lord Mayor of Syd-
ney is discovering. That worthy, shortly before
the recent general elections, told a Mel-
bourne interviewer that Langism was dead.
The storm created by the intimation among
Sydney Laborites caused Mostyn to declare
he had been misreported; the trouble was
that his own union, in common with every-
one else, declined to believe him. Now the
Australian Journalists’ Association is rub-
bing it in. It has asked the Sydney branch
of the A.L.P. to take the matter up again,
and is forwarding affidavits supporting the
absolute authenticity of the report of the
interview.
“Leo Lear” : There were attempts to estab-
lish Australian magazines long before the
period of which “D.McM.” writes (B.
10/11/’27). The year 1543 saw the birth
of three so-called “colonial monthlies” at
2s. 6d. each. Melbourne’s contribution was
the Port Phillip Magazine • Hobart pro-
duced the South Briton, which announced
that “of local politics, polemics and person-
alities we are inflexibly determined to steer
clear” ; and in Sydney appeared the N.S.W.
Monthly, of which A. .1. Slatterie was
editor. None of them, I think, lived long;
the last was unkindly described by a con-
temporary as “the most tedious volume we
have ever attempted to wade through.”
“D. 11.5.” : Let me butt in with something
cheerful to set against the hard-luck stories of
various Bulletin contributors. The first
drawing of mine appearing in The Bulletin
was one somebody pinched from me and sent
in on his own. This set me thinking, and pre-
sently I rolled up my sleeves, spat on botli
hands and spent a whole Sunday morning
putting all I knew into a drawing of a
tearful widow declaring that the deceased
had been more like a friend than a husband
to her and that was why she was so sorry.
In a day or two I got a letter, signed W.
Macleod, informing me that the editor liked
my drawing and asking me to come and see
him. I did, and left with half a dozen gags
to fit drawings to. Since then, away back in
’95, I don’t think I missed an issue until
last year the paper ran out of my stuff
while I was holidaying in Queensland. By
the way. that drawing the editor liked lay
unpublished for nearly seven years and then
showed up in a Christmas number. It had
been paid for on acceptance, so I didn’t
worry.
WHISTLES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s the siren of the woollen-mills that
yanks us from our beds;
The whoop of outward steamers as they
churn towards the Heads ;
The husky howl at midnight of the panting
“goods” that shunt;
The whistle of the umpire, as lie crabs a
stagey stunt;
The trilling of the office-boys, with staves
from “Bose Marie” ;
The warning of the railway-guards to leave
our scalding tea ; .
The tuner-in on Stadium nights, and he s
a sorry hound;
But worst of all these whistlers is the
postie on his round,
With circulars and catalogues and bills he
ne’er forgets,
And dogneared poems homing “with the
Editor’s regrets.”

From four to six cylinders—and
then to Knight-engined cars
Owners of four-cylinder cars are changing to six cylinders for better perform
ance. Now another advancement in motor performance is causing owners of six-
cylinder cars to buy motor cars powered by the famous six-cylinder Knight
double sleeve engine.
That same feeling of quicker and smoother power experienced in changing from
four to six cylinders is again felt by owners who for the first time sit behind the
wheel of the Falcon-Knight.
Due to simplicity of design the Falcon-Knight engine delivers smooth, quiet, un-
interrupted performance for many thousands of miles.
And the remarkable performance of this famous type of engine is changing the
trend of the whole motor car industry.
To keep abreast of the latest developments in motoring, we invite you to inspect
the Falcon-Knight models now on display at our show rooms and to test the re-
markable qualities of this new low priced car in a trial drive.

Sydney theatre managements are busy
preparing Christmas fare. “The Cuckoo in
the Nest” will arrive at the Criterion on
December 8, when the Margaret Lawrence
season terminates. “Castles in the Air” will
vanish from Her Majesty’s in time to let
“Rose Marie” come back for a three weeks’
revival, starting on December 17; the
money-spinner has already run for over 600
performances in Australian cities, and moves
on to Maoriland after the Sydney dates.
“Archie” is doing good business at the St.
James, but will have to step out to let “Puss
in Boots” take possession at Christmas-
time. and Frank Neil will have a daytime
pantomime with morning and afternoon ses-
sions at the Grand Opera House. Mean-
time “The Gorilla” pursues his remunerative
way. The public taste for thrill and mys-
tery, merely whetted by “The Ringer,” is
being met by “The Terror” at the Royal,
wher e there are crowded houses nightly. The
Empire is not given any cause for worry
about the business “Tweekie” is doing,
either; this afteimoon it starts off a “second
edition,” to stimulate public interest still
further; and the whole of the proceeds of
the opening matinee go to the Greycliffe dis-
aster fund. “The Broken Wing,” having
suffered from public neglect, ceases suddenly
at the Palace to-morrow (Friday) night;
on Saturday Compton Coutts and a new
comedy company will introduce “Oh, Rich-
ard, How Could You!” The mid-week per-
formances of “The Awakening of Spring”
will cease at the Playbox Theatre after the
first Wednesday in December.
* * # #
Hetty King has introduced “The Guards-
man” as a new number at Sydney Tivoli;
it has the spice of novelty even if it hardly
justifies the elaborate setting. Audiences are
slow to tire of the “Fillem-up; It is My
Birthday” song, levied on by every male
impersonator; they love to hear the corks go
“Pop-pop pop !” The bill is a good one ; Brown
and Willa reappear with some changes in
their artistic rag-pictures, and George Hurd
and the Di Gatanos contribute turns of real
quality. Yet business so needs stimulating
that the dancing trio give a special morning
session on some days to instruct patrons
(without charge) in a new dance. Consider-
ing the violence of their corybantics, their
job seems a fairly strenuous one.
* * * *
“Barebacks” is the main dish in. the new menu
presented by Jim Gerald and Co. at Fullers’
Theatre (Sydney) ; in the course of it Gerald
upends himself and dances for a while on
bis neck. In the first part some good vaude-
ville turns are provided by Phyllis du Barry,
who has got away from her early cabaret
style and can now fill a theatre with her
tuneful remarks, and by the juveniles Lorna,
Lance, Ferna and Baby Leslie. Gerald’s
explanation of how a detective looks for clues
is particularly droll.
* # * *
Germany made its picture industry by
insisting that Uncle .Sam should take Ger-
man films in exchange for Hollywood pro-
ductions, and from the samples that have
reached this country America is getting
much the better of.the exchange. But it is
a pity that superfluous captions should have
been crowded into “The Last Laugh,'
screened at the Piccadilly, Sydney; the film
when originally shown in England, scored an
artistic triumph by being a picture that
needed no explanation. It tells the story of
a hotel commissionaire, grown old and
reduced to a job as wash-room attendant,
where the people who once deferred to him
make him a subject of ridicule and pity.
After plumbing the very depths of humili-
ation the old man succeeds in re-compelling
respect; the artistic treatment of the theme
makes the tragedy as real as if the central
figure were an overthrown conqueror.
“Cradle Snatchers,” which is considerably less
pleasing as a film than as a play, is paired
with the German production. “Becky” is
shown at Hoyt’s with the really-humorous
“For the Love of Mike.” Amongst the
interesting screen events of the week was
the showing at the Kind’s Hall, by Dr.
Harvey Sutton, of “The Gift of Life,”, a
straightforward educational film dealing with
the facts of reproduction. It illustrates how
the pictures may be used to convey facts
which would remain hazy if imparted by
mere verbal instruction.
An artistic vagabondage :
There is education as well as enjoyment in the
exhibition of the water-colors of Lionel Lindsay at the
Macquarie Galleries, Bligh-street, Sydney. A feature of
the collection is that there is no guide-book illustrat-
ing about it; the Famous Places of Europe, which
every rushing tourist wants to “do,” are omitted,
except for one or two views of Venice, which the
artist has caught from a new angle. But you can
follow the artist’s roaming through the stark sun-
light of Spain, sharing the delight of “A Spring
Morning in Segovia,” pausing to look at the quaint
building of the “Hostel of the Poor” in the same
place, passing through Avila, old Toledo, Guadalupe
and other ancient towns, with a glance for such
quaintly-named places as “The Home of the Vine”
with the hanging foliage for its living sign. In
France you may saunter through the village of
Villefranche, with its “Old Houses” clambering
against the sides of each other and up the hill, and
La Turbie, with its great monument to Augustus
falling into ruin; and “Monte Carlo” holds less
attraction. In Italy there would seem to be as
much tearing up of streets and dismantling of old
buildings as in Sydney; but there is usually the
background of some ancient pile, dreaming in
serene glory ; Capri and Taormina, with its old
Greek theatre, will please most. It is real holiday
work, and has that spirit of freshness w r hich conies
from the inspired mood, something to set against
the laziness which creeps into a few of the pictures.

Three short plays were the offerings of the
Melbourne Repertory Theatre Society on
Thursday night at St. Peter’s Hall. “The
Woman Tamer,” by Louis Esson, is an inci-
dent of “push life” ; Leo Bui’ke and Louie
Dunn were admirably placed and seemed to
revel in the vocabulary assigned to them.
There was no moral uplift in the clever
fragment, though the Rev. L. Arnold was
producer. “In the Darkness,” by Totherop,
is a near tragedy. Farmer Nathan seeks to
hide from his wife that his sight is going,
with the result that she puts down his stumb-
ling steps and dour manner to drunkenness.
She has made up her mind to elope with a
neighbor when the blow falls, and a thor-
oughly repentant lady discovers her mis-
take. The piece was well handled by Betty
Rae, Oscar Behrend, Catherine Bryce and
Jack O’Keefe, Mrs. Rae being producer.
Isabel Handley was responsible for the pre-
sentation of Milne’s “The Boy Comes
Home”; Eric Donald was the youth who
returns from the war to impress upon his
uncle that he is no longer a mere boy but
a leader of men. W. 11. Chandler won good
opinions as the narrow-minded relative who
dealt in jam; Ilettie Feuerman. Ethel See-
kamp and Leoni Levy completed the cast.

The end of “The Last Warning” is in

phanfeom rattle of “The Ghost Train” will

role played by Betty Ross Clark. At the
Theatre Royal to-morrow night the final cur-
tain will fall on “The Whole Town’s Talk-
ing.” “Outward Bound,” the barque that
carries a picked cargo of souls to the Here-
after, will be put into commission again on
Saturday. The Vanbrugh-Boucicault com-
pany is addicted to short runs and quick
changes, but “Caroline” has become so popu-
lar a person that the date of the next pro-
duction —Maugham’s “The Letter” —is not
yet announced. “The Student Prince” goes on
his melodious way at His Majesty’s, and is
voted the best show the Firm has staged
for many a month. James Liddy, Beppe de
Vries, Arthur Stigant, Hedley Hall and the
male chorus share the headlines.
When the Firm gets busy on its grand-
opera season next year there will no doubt
be the usual cry about Australians not get-
ting a fair show. Yet when anybody gives
local song-birds a chance in classic work,
the results are frequently discouraging to the
promoter. The enterprise of the Filippini
couple in this respect in the just-concluded
season at Melbourne Princess deserved
better support. “Carmen,” on Saturday night,
was the final of the season. Elsie Woolley,
of Adelaide, was a pLasantly-vocal leading
lady. Count Filippini was sufficiently well
to appear as Escamillo, and the Toreador
song scena was a vast success. Marcella Ber-
ardi, whose light notes were heard during the
week in “Lucia,” was the Micaela. As a tribute
to the Filippinis the company arranged a
special programme of “excerpts” for last
night (Wednesday).
“THE STUDENT PRINCE,” AT
MELBOURNE HIS MAJESTY’S.
James Liddy as the Prince, Adele Crane
as the Princess.
The Melbourne Opera Company will give
the long-shelved comic opera “Dorothy” an
airing on Saturday night at the Princess.
Allen Bindley, the well-kno\yn conductor of
St. Patrick’s Cathedral choir, will brandish
the baton.
Owen McGiveney, a quick-change artist
from ’Murca, snaps some of the electric-light
sign over Melbourne Tivoli this week. George
Carney is transferring his cab and ex-mili-
tary charger to another stand. The quartette
of colored gentlemen, monarchs of jazz and
syncopated song, have also about reached
their last bars.

Songs of the popular ballad variety pos-
sessing no tonal intricacies were those _ of
Edith Harrhy’s composition at her recital
in Melbourne Assembly Hall on Nov. 7.
Several numbers were rendered by the lady
herself; she was particularly happy in her
“Children’s Songs.” Arnold Ashworth, the
possessor of a fine baritone voice and an excel-
lent sense of interpretation, was at his best
in the composer’s “Two Songs of the Sea,”
set to Dr. C. H. Souter’s verses, and in
“Requiem,” words by Rupert Atkinson. Vio-
linist Gertrude Alger played with charm the
“Reverie” and “Romance in D,” also by the
versatile Edith Harrhy, who, besides accom-
panying her assisting artists, played some
Chopin effectively.
# * * *
The British war film “Mons” will com-
mence its showing at Melbourne Playhouse
on Saturday night. The picture has already
been seen by the privileged few at the Uni-
versity, where it was the initial offering to a
gathering got together to form a Film Club
—in effect a sort of Repertory Picture Move-
ment. Artistically the “Mons” film is an
advance on the war pictures to which
cinema patrons have been accustomed; the
art of its production is displayed down to the
point of selecting distinctly German types
for the faces of the Hun troops, as well as
Scots who are indubitable Scots; and there
is undeniable reality about the arrangement
of the scenes in which the opposing troops
get to grips. Melbourne ought to give it a
long season.
At Melbourne Majestic on Saturday
“Blighty” will be replaced by “The Price of
Honor,” with Dorothy Revier and Malcolm
McGregor in the lead. It is the old story of
the conviction and punishment of an innocent
man on circumstantial evidence; his release
after many years complicates matters further.
The programme is brightened up a little by a
William Fox comedy, “Two Girls Wanted.”
“A Night of Dove” is the chief offering
at Hoyt’s (Melbourne) this week. The
scene is laid in Spain, Vilma Banky and
Ronald Colman are in the leads, and th<
trend of the drama may be indicated by th<
spruiker’s glowing reference to “love that
leaps like molten fire through your veins, anc
suspense that sizzles up and down youi
spine.”
SjJ »i'
Melbourne Art Shows :
A body with the somewhat cumbrous designation
of F rancaise d’Expansion et
d’Echanges Artistiques” has sent through the French
Consul a collection of prints representing the art
of etching, engraving and lithography of the lead-
ing artists of the nineteenth century who worked in
those media. The show, which is being held for
another week, at the New Gallery, is not a money-
making scheme, though the exhibits are for sale and
are being bought up rapidly at prices well within
the reach of most art-lovers. The last century in
France was the high-water mark of engraving,
many famous painters turning to this medium of ex-
pression. Of those whose names are included in
these 250 prints are Corot, Millet, Rousseau and
Rodin. An original engraving by the great Charles
Meryon, who died in 1868, is perhaps the star piece.
The idea was a happy one, and should lead to
further interchange of art between Australia and
France. The society was previously responsible
for a similar exhibition in Sydney.
* * * *
The film is our only fare at the theatres
since Muriel Starr concluded her season on
Saturday. After three months of plays
largely devoted to the doings of crooks, Adel-
aide folk should be able to crack a safe by
American methods. The season closed on
gifts, streamers and a promise from Muriel
to return next year. At the Majestic Theatre
the Robert Roberts Revue Company still
hold the boards , with a potpourri of clever
fooling. Dame Nellie Melba has given two
packed concerts at the Exhibition Building;
the diva tripped on like a 17-year-old in white
silk. Her juvenile pupil Greta Callow demon-
strated the possession of a sweet voice, but
Clive Carey’s numbers left the audience in
doubt as to whether they were comedy items
or not. Dear old John Lemmone piped his
flute as sweetly as of yore.
“X.N.0.”: People having special know-
ledge of a film subject are apt to criticise
the production for incorrect detail, regard-
hiss of the fact that the errors may be harm-
less. “The Flag Lieutenant” is a good
example. Towards the end, for instance, the
marine officer is shown reporting to the
admiral that the guard is ready for the
King’s birthday salute. Actually the officer
of the watch, having sounded the guard call
and seen the marines apparently ready, would
get an informal O.K. from the marine officer
and would tell the commander, who in turn
would report to the captain, upon whom the
flag-lieutenant would probably be waiting
to act as a messenger to the admiral. The
business, if screened with sub-titles, would
look silly. I saw the whole procedure gone
through once in a ship-made play, and it
evoked peals of laughter, even from an
entirely naval audience. One may hope that
the British Admiralty will permit many more
such pictures as “The Flag Lieutenant” to
be made. They will be a useful antidote to
the recent lending of the U.S. Navy for
movie purposes, in which detail was shock-
ingly burlesqued. One picture showed officers
and men practically hob-nobbing in a sort of
custard-pie comedy.
“Lud” : George Gee, whose comedy powers
came to the aid of many a weak musical
comedy in Australia, has distinctly made
good in London. His first West End appear-
ance was a few months ago in a concoction
called “White Birds,” which proved a fiasco.
Gee has bobbed up in Clayton and Waller’s
new show at the Palace —an American piece,
“Kitty’s Kisses,” rechristened “The Girl
Friend” —and got there with both feet. One
of the best-known London critics concludes
a eulogistic notice of his performance thus:
There are lots of other English comedians waiting
in the provinces, or exiled at the Antipodes.
It would not be surprising to find English
theatrical managers in Australia searching
for talent.
“Ike Hollar”: The pageant has become a
recognised form of commemoration in Europe.
It has been seldom used in Australia, but
church people intend to stage a spectacular
show of the kind in Sydney in December.
The affair is to follow in great measure the
lines of one at the Albert Hall, London,
which illustrated the growth of religious
ideas through the centuries, especially deal-
ing with the work of missionaries. An Aus-
tralian section will show the arrival of
Spanish, Dutch and English explorers, the
early church services, and the efforts to lift
the abo. to the spiritual heights of trousers.
The Australian Board of Missions is man-
aging the affair.
“St. John’s Green” (Lond.) : A play-
wright who combines music and an estate-
agency for a livelihood is an unusual com-
bination, especially when his will is proved
for £13,850. Such was Albert Edward Ben;
son. of Wigan, author of “Loyalty House"
and “The Lady of Haigh.” He was one of
the group of dramatists known as the Man-
chester School, of which the author of
“Hindle Wakes” was the chief.

How General Motors Proving Ground Protects You
On a modern high speed
track General Motors cars
are tested for speed and
endurance.
Willi
General Motors cars are
driven through a special
“bath” of water to test the
effect of such treatment in
actual use.
' 4
fk
v® P
Braking pi'essure and other
details of operation are
tested by scientific instru-
ments especially developed
for the purpose.
CT UPP O S E you, before
' selecting a car, could
subject it to years of the most
rigorous tests in competition with
the best cars of its class. You
would then feel absolutely safe
in judging the car—because you
would know exactly what the
car could do.
That is exactly what the General
Motors Proving Ground does for
you.
There the cars are driven night
and day, in all weathers—for
thousands upon thousands of
miles—harder and further than
any owner would drive his car
in years.
At the Proving Ground are
grades from 7.26 per cent, to 24
per cent.—to prove hill-climbing
ability. Every type of road is
here—from mud to concrete.
There is a speedway for speed
and power tests. A depression
filled with water for the famous
“bath tub test.”
At the Proving Ground every
General Motors car must pass
over 100 tests—precise tests that
remove all doubt, and make it
certain that General Motors cars
will stand up and deliver long
care-free service.
New improvements and devices
are tested here—new fuels—new
appliances are tried out—all to
the end that General Motors
cars shall be the best cars for
you to buy.
Millions of people all over the
world know that General Motors
cars are good cars to buy —and
each year more people reach
the same conclusion and buy
General Motors cars.

“I. Phelps”: I have always said that as
a producer Dion Boucicault was a decade
ahead of his time. In “Caroline” the calves
of the maid-servants are encased in open-
work platinum stockings, which even our
ultra-fashionable consider a novelty. The
puce uniforms of the menials, which fit in so
choicely with Boueicault’s color scheme, are
another 1927 note in a comedy which dates
back to 1916.
“Goldilocks”: Leon Gordon, retained in
Australia to finish a “Tea for Three” season
with Judith Anderson in Sydney and Mel-
bourne, rushed to America after the washing-
up. He was to star in Barry Comner’s play
“The Desperado,” produce a new play of his
own (“Tin Soldiers”) and direct a play
translated from the French for a Noo Yoik
manager. Now we are told he has been re-
engaged by J.C.W., Ltd. Apparently the
gentleman could not resist a chance of return-
ing to the Commonwealth, having found our
what it is like. A lot of English and Ameri-
can actors are like that.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Edwin Geach doubtless
had an early look at the film-version of “The
Wrong Mr. Wright.” The spoken play was
one of the money-spinners which George Wil-
loughby and Geach put on in the days of their
partnership—“ What Happened to Jones” was
the most memorable of the others. Wil-
loughby was senior partner, but Edwin has
made a fortune out of his picture interests,
while George, keeping to the stage, draws a
salary from Fullers.
“Santander”: In “The Letter,” Dion
Boucicault’s next play at Melbourne King’s,
the little man will have an unusual part
—that of a cultured but oily Chinese manag-
ing clerk for an English solicitor. “The
Letter,” now in action in New York, has
failed to shake that sophisticated metropolis,
but the piece has shocked one or two
Canadian critics. The Toronto Globe
refused to comment on the play at all, and
took the unprecedented step of declining the
advertisements.
“Lud”: “First Old Man” (B. 27/10/’27)
might have added “Dracula” to the list of
stage successes written by theatrical people.
The blood-curdling novel was from the pen
of Henry Irving’s business manager, Bram
Stoker. Adapted by a provincial actor-
manager and played in the “No. 2” towns for
a couple of years, the thing made so much
money that its proprietor thought he would
have a shot at the metropolis. He took it
to the Little Theatre. The critics scoffed
at it; the public flocked to it. The show
soon moved to a larger house, and later to
the spacious Prince of Wales’s, where it is
still going strong after eight months. “Dra-
cula” will be coming to Australia soon.
“A.G.M.” : London is trying a scheme for
buying theatre seats in the mass and retail-
ing them at reduced rates to members of a
club who pay a fee of 10s. a year. The claim
is made that it will be possible to get tickets
at from one to five shillings less than adver-
tised prices, provided members are willing to
wait till the first rush is over. In New York
there are agencies which buy up tickets for
successful plays by the bushel and sell them
at a big profit. Then there are “cut-rate’
agencies which foster plays that have not
been successful or are trying to win their
way. If the London plan works it might be
introduced in Australia.
“Flaming Youth”: Margaret Bannerman,
who was cited as co-re. in the case in which
Marie Lohr divorced Val Prinsep, will be the
Australian theatrical event of next year. The
beautiful blonde is a ' Canadian. Her first
appearance on the London stage was in a
small part in 1915, but she was in leads the
following year, and has been busy ever sine;.
Her private passion is the collection of
antiques; but Val Prinsep, who is only 39,
can hardly be described as an antique.
“Flaming Youth”: “The Broken Wing”
has its merits, but it slumped so badly at
Sydney Palace that, before a week was out,
the management decided to run it for only
one week more and rush the co. back to
Melbourne for a revival of “Outward
Bound.” The main cause of failure was that
“The Broken Wing” seemed trivial to the
sort of people who liked “Outward Bound.”
A theatre will get a reputation for providing
a certain class of fare, and managements
have to take this grouping of patrons into
account. Harry Green’s failure in London
THANK HEAVEN SHAKSPEARE DIDN’T SHAVE THEM ALU
LEADING MAN: “I can’t play Hamlet to-night with a growth like this. You must give
me the price of a shave.”
MANAGER: “Ninepence? Can’t be done. We’ll do Macbeth instead.”
with “The Music Master” —its failure
there caused it to be shelved after Mosco-
vitch had rehearsed it in Sydney—was
due to the show being produced at the unsuit-
able Little Theatre, which has the patronage
of people who don’t mind paying big prices
but like a lot of thrill for their money.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : Ben Travers gave as a
sort of foreword to his book “The Cuckoo
in the Nest” an extract from a schoolboy’s
essay : “The cuckoo is a bird which lays other
birds’ eggs in its nest and vice versa.” Of
course, that titbit has been worked into the
stage version. Usually a book loses in
dramatisation, but “The Cuckoo” managed a
good run in London. It opens at Sydney
Criterion on December 3.
“Hamfat”: “Oh. Richard, How Could
You!” brings Compton Coutts back to the
boards after wanderings in the silent drama.
He was the Rev. Meekin in “The Term of
His Natural Life” picture, and lived
amongst the Fijians while he assisted Eva
Novak and Edith Roberts with The
Adorable Outcast.” Coutts was brought by
Hugh Ward to Australia for “Tons of
Money” and “Battling Butler.” Blue skies
and golden beaches put their spell upon him,
as they have done upon many other mum-
mers.
‘*San.”- For some unexplained reason the
name of the doctor who circulates in the
shadow of “The Student Prince in
Melbourne has been altered to Engel. In
the American version of the show, m the
film that followed it across innumerable
screens, and in "Old Heidelberg, which
provided “The Student Prince with plot
and sustenance, lie was plain I)r. Ju finer
Tlie character will stir the memories of old
playgoers because of the excellence ot the
impersonation by Dudley _ Clinton, second
only in importance to Nellie Stewart in the
inveigling part of Kathis. It happened at
the Melbourne Princess.
“Permanent Blot”: Leslie Doiiagliey, of
the Moscovitch co., was one of the 1 ollard
Lilliputians. In a Continental restaurant,
while waiting patiently for our gargon, who
seemed to spend hours somewhere between
courses, he filled in time describing some ot
his experiences in Algiers. “By the way* our
waiter tells me that lie comes from Algiers,
I said. “With every dish?” queried DOll-
- flicking the ash from his cigarette.
“Flaming Youth”: Australia is losing
tenor Walter Kirby, who is giving a series
of recitals before leaving for England. Kirby
is one of the best-known figures in Aus-
tralian music. He lias sung in everything
from oratorio to vaudeville.
“Caesar’s Ghost”: Herbert Leigh, who finds
life now a continual shuffle from company
to company, started his professional career
in Capetown with the Wheeler management
30 years ago. Subsequently he ran a show
in partnership with Bailey; Beatrice Day
was his leading lady. Herbert’s co. was in
the Transvaal at the outset of the Boer War,
and had to make a race for it. He subse-
quently came to Australia. For many years
J'.C.W. has found him one of its most useful
support men.
“Clifford Snook”: “The King of Kings,”
a film story of Christ which has arrived here,
is supposed to be both educational and artis-
tic after the Yankee fashion, but in the
educational sense it could certainly be
improved on. It includes innumerable
Roman soldiers and Jewish mobsters rush-
ing madly round among magnificent build-
ings. At about that point doubts begin. Rome
didn’t keep hordes of soldiers in an exceed-
ingly small and generally-peaoeful province
not located on any hazardous frontier, and
there was never a great abundance of what
would now be called magnificent buildings
in Jerusalem. Solomon's much-advertised
temple has been measured up, and F. W.
Newman returns the verdict that it “had a
strong general resemblance in form to a
very small European cathedral.” And it is a
catchpenny vulgarism to paint Mary Magda-
lene as (so one Sydney morning ass put it)
“the immortal courtesan, decked, semi-nude
in jewels, lounging before the dissolute rich
of Magdala.” There isn’t a word in the
Scripture against the lady’s character. And
the dissolute rich of Magdala should be
taken with a pint of salt. Where did the
people of that petty fishing town get their
riches ?
“Hamfat”: Madame Alda, smarting under
the neglect she quite undeservedly received
in Australia, boiled over upon her return to
America, declaring that Australia is “detest-
able” and its people “loathsome.” Coming
back to the land she left as a poor girl, after
triumphs in America, she naturally felt the
slight of halls which were sometimes heart-
freezing in their emptiness. She was the
tail-end of a long procession of star concert
performers, and her “publicity” was ill-man-
aged ; these were two of the reasons for the
failure of her season. The extravagance of
her anger is accepted in sorrow more than
in anger.
“Goldilocks” : “The Seventh Heaven” has
provided London with its latest stage crash.
The play failed when put on at Sydney
Royal, although the screen version is doing
well. “The Broken Wing” has phutted in
Sydney; it registered the same lack of suc-
cess when Thurston Hall staged it at Mel-
bourne King’s; yet Hall and Cunningham
(the manager of the company which is just
closing down at Sydney Palace) ran it in
South Africa for a long and successful
season. “The Music Master,” in which
Harry Green crashed in London, ran for
1007 consecutive performances in New
York, with David Warfield in the name
part. The press-agent never knows how a
public will respond to his tickling.
“Hamfat” : The man who was declared to
be no actor because he still had teeth has
companions. Grattan Riggs, who revelled in
quick-change disguises, carried half a dozen
plates of teeth, all different in construction.
He had sacrificed perfect ivories to enable
him to alter the appearance of his mouth at
will. There are actors who have been even
more meticulous. It is regarded as a breach
of theatrical custom to wear anything in the
street that the mummer wears on the stage.
But I was astounded when a veteran thun-
dered a denunciation because I did not wear
a wig in a character part. “What!” he
roared. “Wearing the same hair on the stage
that you wear in the street. My boy, my boy,
you will never be an act-or!”
“Flaming Youth”: Jack Fanning, doyen
of Australian advance men, has never
smoked, and —until the doctor intervened
recently—never touched liquor. His first
acquaintance with alcohol was when he went
to a wine man for an advertisement for a
theatre programme. Fanning had planned
what lie should do when asked to “have one.”
Owing to a recent illness, he explained, all
that he dare take was a little gin. (He
reckoned that gin would be the last sort of
liquor to be found in the wine-mercliant's
office.) “Aha! I’ve got the very thing.
Best gin in Australia,” said the wine man.
And the martyr had to take two tots.
“L.H.P.” “Never since ‘The Orphans of
Paris’ has such a negligible play been pro-
duced,” says a scornful Sydney critic. Well,
I, for one, wouldn’t mind seeing a revival of
“The Two Orphans” (the correct title)
or dividing the profits with the management.
“The Two Orphans” was a money-spinner
for a score of years. Adapted from the
French by John Oxenford, London Times
critic, it was first staged at the Olympic
Theatre in 1874. George Rignold produced
it in Australia in 1890, his brother Bill
playing Jacques. In a revival in the middle
’nineties at Sydney Royal, George himself
took the big part; the co. included Emily
Hughes (Louise), Roland Watts-Phillips
(Henriette), Harry Diver (Pierre), Harry
Plimmer (Armand), Frank Hawthorne (the
Marquis) and Jimmy Hazlitt (the Count).
There was another production at the Opera
House, Sydney, in 1920, when it proved
anything but “negligible” from every point
of view.
“Peter Pan”: Percy Hutchison, the Lon-
don actor-manager, has been at loggerheads
with one or two of the dramatic critics in
South Africa, where he is presenting "The
Ghost Train.” A Maritzburg critic declared
that the best performance was given by the
parrot in the cage. Hutchison replied that
the cage was empty, like the critic's head.
The citizens supported Hutchison, who in a
speech at Durban threatened to horsewhip
any critic who was “merely personal and
insulting.” There must be something in the
S’African air!
“Caesar’s Ghost” : Annette Kellerman has
made a comfortable niche for herself on
British vaudeville circuits.. When last sne
appeared at London Coliseum the ‘ruli
House” signs had to go up. Annette adds
wire-walking, dancing and physical exercises
to her swimming and diving exhibitions.
BEAUTY AND THE FILMS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“ ‘Beauty is the merchandise of the motion picture,
and Australia is practically barren of beauty,’ said
It. J. Dexter, editor of Everyone’s Magazine, giving
evidence before the Film Commission. ‘Nature made
a wonderful job of the continent, but as human
beings we are an ugly race.’ ”
I used to think that you were fair,
Round-bosomed maids of farm and beach !
I held no classic grace as rare,
No ancient charm quite out of reach,
While Dian limbs and sunlit hair
Intrigued my glance. But now one voids
Your claim. You lack the baby stare
Of Hollywood.... and adenoids.
I used to think that you were fine,
Deep-chested lads of field and shore.
I held that an Hellenic line
Which one had thought to see no more
Was here in bold and bronzed design
Of living forms. Alas, the real
Truth is one sees in you no sign
Of Hollywood.... and “sex-appeal.”
I used to think that you, and you,
O men and maidens of my land,
“Screened” wondrous well against the b]ue
Of southern skies, that some deft hand
And artist mind had fashioned true;
But now this critic tells us fiat
That none of you would ever do
For Hollywood.. . .Thank God for that!

At last** a real lubricant!
For the hearings of motor cars, motor
farm implements, machinery
Cheap greases are the “bug-bear” of those who
must use lubricants. You may never recognize
them as such but you do “recognize” the re-
pair bills they cause.
Cheap greases will literally bum up if a bear-
ing becomes heated. They freeze solid in winter
weather. Loaded with fillers, they get lumpy
and rancid and corrode the bearings.
These are the reasons for Alemite Chassis Lu-
bricant. Designed especially for use with the
Alemite High Pressure Lubrication System it
is equally valuable for the lubrication of any
bearing because of its remarkable record of
performance.
Alemite Chassis Lubricant is an absolutely
pure product. It will stand up under 3000
pounds pressure. (Average grease breaks down
at 200 pounds). It resists heat up to 400 de-
grees Fahrenheit. And it will lubricate per-
fectly at 30 degrees below zero.
Cut down operating costs with
this better lubricant
Carefully compiled records show conclusively
that at least 80% of the repairs on the moving
parts of motor cars, farm implements, indus-
trial machinery, motor boats, etc. are caused
by faulty lubrication or neglected lubrication.
The Alemite High Pressure Lubrication Sys-
tem has already made lubrication easy and
positive. It is in use today on countless thou-
sands of farm implements and industrial ma-
chines; on more than 10,000,000 motor cars.
Now Alemite Lubricant provides a truly re-
liable product for use either with the Alemite
System or wherever a lubricating grease or oil
is needed.
Unless you know a brand, that you can abso-
lutely rely upon, we urge you to specify genu-
ine Alemite Chassis Lubricant. Its superior
lubricating power, its astonishingly long-wear-
ing qualities, will truly amaze you.
If your regular service man cannot supply you,
write to any of the distributors listed below
and we will see that you are taken care of
promptly.

Hungry as a Bear
and Can’t Elat!
A great many people get angry when you tell them they’ve got dyspepsia, but ’way down
deep in their stomachs they know they’ve got it. “I’d love to eat it, but I can’t,” is one
kind of dyspepsia. “I hate to think of it,” is another kind. There are thousands of people
to-day who hate their meals and love them at the same time. They haven’t that fine, empty,
hungry, eat-everything-in-sight kind of feeling which goes with every good, healthy stomach.
And then there are others whose mouths don't water at mealtime, or at any other
time. They sit at the table and go through the motions only because it’s time to eat.
These people, too, are dyspeptics. Poor appetite, Iqss of strength, nervousness, headaehe,
offensive breath, heartburn, indigestion and dyspepsia are among the results of a disordered
stomach.
Every possible kind of stomach-trouble can be remedied by taking; stomething which
digests what you eat and will just take right hold of all the food in your stomach and
digest it alone, without the help of the stomach, and let the stomach take a rest. DR.
SHELDON’S DIGESTIVE TABULES do this very thing. They are composed of the best
digestives known to science, and are absolutely safe. They do exactly the work that a good,
strong, healthy stomach does. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules relieve all cases of dyspepsia,
indigestion, burning or irritation, loss of appetite, bloat, brash, belching, aversion to food,
fermentation and gas in the stomach. Dr. Sheldon’s Digestive Tabules will make you feel
“good” before and after each meal, and make your stomach strong and healthy again.

Finnard Woods.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THREE steps up and two steps down
Takes you over Finnard Stile;
Through the woods the path is brown
Under beech and fir a mile.
Easy come and easy go;
Take the stile, be sure you can—
Och, the leaves that fall and blow
Never feel the foot of man!
Once a stranger proud and tall
Set his foot upon the way.
Was it pain that made him call
Through the trees a night and day?
Shame was on our souls to hear —
Set the milk and hasp the door —
Och, what man but felt the fear
When the stranger came no more?
Molly’s eyes were wild and bright,
Molly’s talk was queer a while;
Sure, she hungered for a sight
Of the land behind the stile.
Morning light on hill and tree,
Shaun O’Kelly heard her go—
“Girl that should be bride to me,
Turn your head and take it slow!”
Sure, ’twas never girl at all —
Wind and light are ill to chase —
Up she went by Grogan’s wall,
Never stopped or turned her face.
Like a hare before the pack
Down the road for half a mile—
Saints and angels, hold her back!
Surely she has crossed the stile.
What will ShauH O’Kelly do?
Troth, his face was paper white —
“Keegan, strong man, let me through!
Casey, give me room and sight!”
Och, for shame! To let him go!
One tall boy and five strong men.
Talk is easy. Shaun could show
That mad day the strength of ten.
Up he went across the stile.
Under beech and fir lie ran,
Down the path that goes a mile
Never touched by foot of man.
“Och, ’tis death, my soul,” we said,
“Man and girl will come no more.”
There’s a mother on her bed
Thinking long and crying sore.
Quiet was the day as death,
Red the trees at evening shone;
Each man spoke below his breath,
Watched the dark of night draw on.
Was it music in the trees?
Was it voices in the air?
Sure, the palsy shook our knees.
Sure, the cold was in our hair.
Heart, was that a cry that rose?
Something passed me thin and white.
Starlight comes and daylight goes
And the Shee will call to-night.
All the air was warm and sweet;
Man and woman felt the fear —
Did we hear the sound of feet
Running past and coming near?
Quiet was the night as death,
Rose a yellow moon and still;
Whisht, and speak below your breath —•
There are ghost-lights on the hill.
Cross-roads meet at Grogan’s wall,
W est and east and north and south;
Did you hear it, heart, at all—
Laughter of a woman’s mouth?
Who came easy down the road
Whitethorn blossom on her hair?
Sure, ’twas Molly’s self that strode
Barebacked on McCarthy’s mare!
Old McCarthy’s mare that strayed,
L°st since April, home again!
Shaun, bold man and not afraid,
W alking held her by the mane.
Och, and what a ploy is here?
Y° u that passed the Finnard stile,
Did you cross the place of fear,
Walk and live the dreadful mile?
"Sure we walked below the trees,
Plucked the thorn and laughed our fill,
Heard the bird-song and the bees
And our hearts are beating still.”
All the air was warm and sweet;
Man and woman felt the fear —
Did we_ hear the sound of feet
Running past and coming near?
Slipped a cloud across the moon.
Was it Molly gave the cry?
Och, the dark that came too soon
Brought a black wind creeping by.
Was it music in the trees ?
Was it voices in the air?
Sure, a palsy shook our knees!
Sure, the cold was in our hair!
Out the moon looked yellow bright,
Strangely on the place it shone,
Long, sweet laughter filled the night....
Horse and man and maid were gone!
Och, no word at all we said;
man met his neighbor’s eye;
C hilder, sleeping in their bed,
Felt the secret thing go by.
Finnard stile is green with moss,
Finnard woods are winter bare—
Heart, the foot that steps across
M alks to strange, sweet music there!

DAVID MCKEE WRIGHT.
A Genteel Young Man.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
YOUNG Mr. Humphrey Jocelyn was one
of our earliest colonists, and a man
of mark and parts. In the year 1812
he was already well known at Sydney, Par-
ramatta and the Hawk-'shury. and even at
that outpost of Australian civilisation, the
Coal River, he had a reputation that varied
according to the status of those who dis-
cussed it.
With a name such as his, you would sup-
pose him to have been, at least, a subaltern
of H.M. 73rd Regiment of Highland
Light Infantry. It was one that would
ornament the records as that of an aide-de-
camp to his Excellency the Governor, as a
distinguished visitor to the Colony, as an
officer of high position in the Civil establish-
ment, or as a moneyed settler to whom Gov-
ernment had been delighted to make exten-
sive land grants and to assign the labor of
many score prisoners of the Crown.
It is almost distressing to be compelled to
confess that in none of these situations, or
in any of a similar sort, might this talented
young man have been found. Such a name —
and it was his real and indisputable name—
seems to imply good birth, good position and
good repute. But not one of these three
desirable conditions of existence were his.
In point of fact, he was a convicted thief
of by no means exalted origin, with a repu-
tation that would nowadays be described as
“flyblown.” In the “flash” language which
he understood so well, he would have been
spoken of as “a family man,” “a prime
gammoner,” “a mace-gloak,” “a mace-pinch,”
and as one who was in “Swell-street.” Being
interpreted, that is to say, he might be
described as a member of the criminal classes,
gifted with plausibility of speech, who
defrauded tradesmen, stole small articles out
of jewellers’ shops, and was assisted in his
depredations by an appearance that was as
elegant as his manners.
Two descriptions of him by contemporaries
serve very well to picture him. Ned
the Smasher — i.e., Ned the Utterer-of-coun-
terfeit-money—once spoke of him in Black
Tom Nutting’s Good Intent Inn; up on the
Rocks, with obvious admiration. “Thishyer
’Umphrey,” he said, sipping his awful Ben
gal rum, “ ’tis no doubt ’e’s a werry leary
cross-cove —one o' th’ best of us. ’E'd pinch
ih’ flesh-bag offen ye afore ye was awake
to it. An’ alius bang up to th’ mark an’
livin’ in Swell-street. Tli’ wonder it is 'e
ever got lagged ! ’E nigh come to th’ crap
one time —cly-fakin’—but ’e gammoned th’
twelve in prime twig. Bin all sorts, ’e ’as.
Law clerk, done a turn in Andrew Miller’s
lugger, a bit-faker, a dummy-hunter, round
abaht at th’ breakin’ up o’ th’ spell—hevery
think! They do say ’e one time played dub
[collected the tolls] at a knappin’-jigger
[turnpike], ’avin’ tied up th’ reg’lar covey.
An’ ’e was nibb'd one night when Oliver
was in town [i.e. one moonlight night], ’cos
’is blowen [woman] dropped th’ skin
Tpurse] ’e’d passed ’er in Longacre, an’ ’e
was bowled out. ‘E’d ’a’ bin twisted that
time, on’y ’e gammons th’ twelve again, an’
gits lagged fer a lifer instead. Oh, ’e’s a leary-
gory ’e is, an’ ’tis a pity that flash-mollisher
bridged ’im like that.”
The other sketch of him is contained in
a letter of recommendation, which the good
lady of Mr. Ellis Bent, Judge-Advocate of
the Colony, wrote to Lieutenant Thomas
Skottowe, Commandant at Newcastle, when
the versatile Mr. Jocelyn was exiled to the
Coal River for having been a party to the
robbery of her household by a young man
who was a servant in it.
“. ... I have grave doubts, dear Mr. Skot-
towe,” wrote the kind-hearted woman,
“whether the young man was really privy to
the thefts of the youth Edwards. However,
my husband and Mr. Redman, the Chief
Constable, being of an opinion that he was,
he has been sent to your District. I cannot
but feel Compassionate towards him, for lie
is a most genteel young man, of great Talent
and Pleasant Address —qualities but too rare
amongst the Unfortunate class in which Cir-
cumstance has placed him. I pride myself
upon being sufficiently a judge of Character
to feel assured that should you extend to
him any Indulgence he will not prove
Unworthy of it. He is, I am told, particu-
larly adept at clerical work, having in bet-
ter days been employed in an Attorney’s
office in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, so that per-
haps you may find him useful to you in this
respect. He has assured me that for his
previous Delinquencies he is thoroughly con-
trite, and I am sure that if you would inter-
est yourself in him”—etc., etc,, etc.
Mrs. Ellis Bent most probably had a
kinder heart than Ned the Smasher, though
probably not much sound judgment respect-
ing the young gentleman for whom they
seem, in some degree, to have had a common
admiration. However that may be, her
letter was the means of relieving Mr. Jocelyn
of the hard labor of wheeling coals out of
the mines in a hand-barrow, and of installing
him as a kind of copying-clerk in the Com-
mandant’s office —an employment which he
found infinitely more agreeable to him. both
physically and temperamentally. That sort
of brutal toil was never popular amongst
prisoners who had “lived in Swell-street.”
* * * *
“Jocelyn,” said Lieutenant Thomas Skot-
towe sorrowfully, “I want to know what yon
did with them. D’ye hear? I’d know
what’s come o’ them. I ask ye now to make
a breast of it and tell me.”
The Commandant of the Coal River settle-
ment was almost plaintive in his manner of
address to the neat, good-looking, open-faced
young man who stood respectfully before
his writing-table. He seemed to be ashamed
of the doubts that possessed him, and, as
though he could not meet the eye of his
convict-clerk, his own gaze was through the
open door of the office, which framed a
sunlit, dazzling picture of the first reaches
of the Hunter River, spreading between
green littorals of mangrove and occasional
gleaming strips of sand towards the darker
t : mber on distant low hills, and the far-
off opal ranges only a little more deeply
blue than the clear sky behind them.
“Sir,” replied the clerk, a flitting look of
pain crossing his clean-cut features, and
astonishment, sorrow and deferential indigna
tion in the reproachful stare of his bi<r,
blue eyes—“ Sir, I am really at a loss, ’pon
my honor I am, Sir. I know nothing of the
articles you have lost, save that from time
to time I have remarked certain of them in
your possession. Indeed. I do not. Might
I beg you to enumerate them again, sir? I

Sign of Dreaded
Eczema '■
ZAM-BUK Will Soon Clear Your Skin.
AS Zam-Buk represents the result of years of
study of skin disease, this great herbal balm
can always be relied upon in cases of fiery eczema
or any itching or inflammatory symptoms.
The world-wide success of Zam-Buk is due to its
unique formula. Zam-Buk contains valuable herbal
essences which are so highly refined that they are
readily absorbed by the tiny pores of . the skin.
Thus Zam-Buk heals from below by reaching under-
lying tissues where disease has its root.
Powerfully antiseptic and agreeably soothing,
Zam-Buk quickly allays irritation. It subdues
inflammation, kills and expels disease germs, and after
thoroughly cleansing the tissues, induces Nature to
grow new healthy skin.
Zam-Buk is absolutely unequalled for pimples,
rashes, eczema, ulcers, abscesses, poisoned wounds,
bad legs,' psoriasis, piles, cuts, bruises, burns and
scalds, etc.
STARTED FROM
INFLAMED SPOT
“I was tor-
tured with
eczema for nine
months,” says
Mrs. R. Jones, of Donation Lane, Toowoomba,
Queensland. “Caused through scratching a
tiny spot on my skin, it ultimately spread
all over my body. The fiery itching was
intense and' I felt like tearing my skin to
pieces. Though I tried all sorts of prepara-
tions. there was no improvement until I used
Zam-Buk. This soon put an end to the burn-
ing and itching. It purified the tissues and
grew new healthy skin.”
ZAM-BUK WINS
A HARO CASE.
Mr. T. D. Kyle,
of “Cathay,”
Belmont Road,
Char lestown,
near Newcastle, N.S.W., says: “For years I
suffered from eczema on my left leg, and the
persistent irritation was frightful. A snail
fortune went in ointments. I was in hospital
for months. I thought I would never be free
of the eczema. It was a hard Agile, even for
Zam-Buk, but after a time I could see im-
provement. This got me to keep on with
the balm. Now, the old sores are all healed
and my skin is perfectly clear.”

am not quite clear—not certain —as to what
you said you had missed.”
The young Commandant looked up. The
likeable fellow confronting him w T as of about
his own age—hardly more than 30. Often
he had taken him upon hunting excursions
into the surrounding forests that were still
dark mysteries to the white man ; more than
once'this unusual convict had attended him
on boating expeditions to Port Stephens.
On cold nights they had even shared the
same blanket; had often drunk from the
same pintpot. He felt towards him rather
as a friend "and comrade than as a gaoler.
And Jocelyn had never presumed upon this.
But yet—who else? Who else possibly
could have robbed him? He sighed uneasily.
Only one man could have robbed him.
“Well, Jocelyn,” he said, “I’ll tell ye again.
There was my watch, a gold chain, a bunch
of seals, a signet ring, a silver-handled pen-
knife and a miniature of a lady in a gold
frame. All taken from my dressing-table
early this morning, before ye wakened me.
They were there at three o’clock —for I did
not sleep well, and read from about one
o'clock to three. I looked at the time just
before I blew out the candle again, and they
were all there, beside the watch and my
pistols, on the table. You woke me at six
o’clock. They were gone then. Wei], what
have you to say?”
“Surely, sir, there are many here to whom
burglary is no unfamiliar avocation?”
“You mean that someone may have entered
my room whilst I slept, and purloined the
articles ?”
“If vou please, your honor—yes.”
“Out of the question—quite impossible.
Every door in the cottage, every window-
save the door from my bedroom on to the
verandah —is always locked and bolted before
I go to bed. I examined them all this morn-
ing with the Sergeant of the Guard —Ser-
geant Kennedy-—arid the locks and bolts had
not been tampered with.”
“But the open door, sir—a thief coming
by the verandah !” •
“ ’Twas bright moonlight all night, and
the sentry’s beat is one of but ten yards—
the length of the verandah —and immediately
before nry door. No one would have passed
him unobsairved. No one. Impossible. You
came in a few minutes before six o’clock
to call me, the sentry having orders to pass
no one else, and in that few minutes, Joce-
lyn, I fear ye fell back into your old ways,
and”
There was nothing overdone in Mr. Hum-
phrey Jocelyn’s rendering of the part of
Outraged Virtue —no ranting declamation,
no flashing eye of injured innocence, no
scornful bitterness of resentment of an
unjust accusation. To look at him, even
omniscient persons like you and I would
have declared him innocent. That open face,
those truthful eyes, that dignified bearing-up
under an overbearing burden of circumstan-
tial evidence —they were perfect. He knew
the Commandant knew, and each knew the
other knew. But the splendid nerve that
had sustained him in argument with 12 good
men and true who wanted to hang him—
in the very shadow of the gallows—stood
to him as it had stood to him years ago as a
little curly-headed chorister of Wells Cathe-
dral, when he had proved his innocence of
fruit-stealing after the Dean had caught him
in the branches of his favorite
He was indeed worthy of the title of “a
prime , gammoner,”
“Sir,” he said, gently, “I know that my
record is not a good one, and that your honor
is well aware of it. Besides what you
know officially, sir, you will remember many
things I have told you during those excur-
sions in the bush when your honor has been
kind enough to desire my attendance upon
you; many things that, however diverting
their narration over the camp-fire may have
been, I am heartily ashamed of, and have
been long resolved never should occur again.
I know that your honor’s experience
of prisoners must inevitably incline your
honor to a belief in the truth of the maxim
‘Once a thief, always a thief.’ ”
“Well, well, Jocelyn, the circumstances of
this case would seem to point to it,” inter-
rupted the Commandant, almost apologeti-
cally.
“I must admit that, sir. It does, indeed,
seem as if no human being save myself
could have appropriated your honor’s pro-
perty.”
“Well, why not make a breast of it,
Jocelyn? Restore me the articles, and you
shall go free of punishment—other than the
quite necessary loss of your present position
of trust. Come now !”
“Sir, I must still most emphatically pro-
test my innocence. Whatever the appear-
ances against me, I must do so—when I am
innocent.”
There was a trace of impatience in Mr.
Skottowe’s voice when he spoke.
“Now look here, Jocelyn, ’tis foolish of
you to persist in such a claim. Look ye, ye
know what powers I have here? PoAver over
your very life. What is to prevent me having
you tied up and given twenty-five with the
cat-o’-nine-tails, until ye see reason? There
are many officers would do so —and that with-
out argument.”
“I know, your honor —as well as I know
your honor’s kindness of heart, if I may
make bold to say so. But, your honor, there
still remains a possibility that your valu-
ables have been removed by other than
human agency.”
“Good God, man, what are ye hinting at?
the supernatural—some Cock-lane ghost
here in Newcastle ! Absurd ! Come now—or
I shall lose my temper with you. What d’ye
mean ?”
“No ghostly visitants, your honor —I mean
your honor’s pet magpie, Dicko.”
The Commandant stared at the imperturb-
able young man, who returned his look with
grave assurance.
“Lord; —the magpie ! Well, now—how
d’ye mean Dicko?”
“He was seen, your honor, a week or so
back, to hop up on the open window of the
kitchen, seize a teaspoon and attempt to
make off with it —which he w'ould have done
had not Thompson, the cook, chased him,
compelling him to drop it. ’Tis well known
that such birds—jackdaws, rooks and no
doubt this New Holland magpie—are
attracted by small bright objects, and can-
not resist appropriating them. May I not
.venture to suggest that he might have entered
your honor's room whilst your honor slept
after daylight this morning, and made off
with the jewellery? ’Tis not impossible, your
honor.”
A look of relief came over Air. Skottowe s
worried countenance. lie gladly hailed this
possible chance of his clerk's guiltlessness.
Rising to his feet, he laughed delightedly.
“By Jove, Jocelyn, it may be so! It may,
indeed, be so. I hope it is so. The bird is
in and out of the house at all hours, and's
as cunning and wicked as an old lag. Per-
haps we shall find the things. Come, we will
search the garden for his ‘plant.’ I shall be
glad if this be the explanation of their
strange vanishing. Come!”
They went out on to the verandah. Mr.
Jocelyn, with great deference, suggested a
plan of campaign.
“Would it not be well, your honor, if I
were to search at the back of the house
whilst your honor looks in the garden here?”
“Yes, yes—do you look in the rear. Seek
everywhere—these birds have queer hiding-
places for their treasures, so I've heard,
when they take to thieving. I’ll explore every
nook of the garden. ’Tis not large.”
When, going through the cottage, he
reached the back of the walled enclosure
with which the rear premises of most houses
in the penal period were furnished—for the
better protection of the lares et penates
within —Mr. Jocelyn made straight for the
woodshed in a far corner. In the space
between the top of the wall and the roof,
at the back, he inserted his hand, felt about
for a moment or two, and removed a small
penknife with a silver handle, which he
slipped into his trouser-pocket.
For ten minutes he noisily explored the
heap of billets and coal. Then he came out
with an air of disappointment, paused a
moment to look at the kerbed well in the
middle of the yard, and went to investigate
the privy in its other corner. After a dili-
gent search he emerged still more dis-
appointed, and gazed round the quadrangle
in a puzzled fashion. Presently, his right
hand in liis trouser-pocket, he sauntered
towards the well, and peered down it, shak-
ing his head. His back was to the kitchen,
but he heard the Commandant’s footsteps as
he walked slowly through the cottage.
“Not a sign of anything, Jocelyn,” said
Mr. Skottowe complainingly—“and that
d —d bird’s been a-watching me all the time.
I’ve a mind to wring his neck.”
Suddenly Mr. Jocelyn uttered an exclama-
tion and stooped to the ground behind the
stone kerbing of the well. He put out his
hand, and seemed to finger something on the
ground.
“Great George!” he cried. “I beg your
honor’s pardon—but look here!”
The Commandant hastened to his side.
Lying in a tuft of grass at the base of the
kerbing was the missing silver penknife. Mr.
Skottowe stared at it a moment, and laughed
ruefully as Jocelyn handed it to him.
“By Heavens, Jocelyn,” he said, “you
were right—’twas that rascal Dicko, surely!
He’s dropped the other things down the well
—the incarnate devil! Not a hope of getting
them, unless we can bail it out. ’Tis very
deep, I believe, and taps a copious spring.
By the Lord, though,” he said, turning to
Mr. Jocelyn with a sigh of relief and a smile
—“I’m glad to find ye innocent, Jocelyn.
Pray pardon my suspicion. But, indeed, the
case looked black against ye!”
“Ah, your honor,” said Mr. Jocelyn hap-
pily—but with no exaggeration in his acting
—“I’ve suffered too much as a consequence
of them to take to those bad courses again !”
Outside the kitchen door, Dicko, the mag-
pie regarded them critically and wisely, his
head cocked upon one side, as who should
say—“Now, if I could only speak!”
* * * *
In the year 1822, being home on leave
from India, Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Skot-
towe, C.B., was prevailed upon by that bril-
liant young advocate, his nephew, Charles
Skottowe, Esq., of the Middle Temple, Bar-
rister at Law, to attend, a gaol-delivery at
the Old Bailey, where Mr. Skottowe was to
defend a very remarkable criminal, who, lie
opined, had an excellent prospect of an early
demise outside the walls of Newgate.
“A most original scoundrel, Uncle Tom—-
a very genteel fellow, too —with a wholly
new sort of defence. Too new, I fear, for
such Tory juries as are to be found in the
City of London.”
It was a matter of the stealing by a valet,
one William Smith, of certain articles of
jewellery from his master, which had been
found secreted beneath his bed. William
Smith was a stoutisli handsome man of about
forty, with side whiskers, clear blue eyes and
a singularly engaging and open countenance.
From the first moment when he saw him
standing in the dock, the Colonel had a vague
notion that he had seen him somewhere be-
fore. So soon as his defence was advanced,
he placed him imriiediately.
Briefly, William Smith’s plea was that the
articles which he had been charged with
appropriating had been hidden beneath his
bed by a pet jackdaw he owned, who was a
most inveterate thief, and had landed his
kind and innocent master in an extremely
unpleasant situation.
This went very well—until the prosecution
interposed three witnesses, former employers
of the prisoner, who each testified to the
same effect —that William Smith’s,Jackdaw'
had alone saved him from being prosecuted
for similar robberies in their several house-
holds. That was the end of the jury’s sym-
pathies with the owner of this embarrassing
bird. The following Monday, at 9 k.m., Wil-
liam Smith would hang.
The Colonel obtained a word with the
doomed man —who greeted him pleasantly—
before his removal to the condemned cell.
“Well, Jocelyn, I am truly sorry for you.
And Dicko at the Coal River—a similar
defence, I suppose?”
“Don’t mention it. Mr. Skottowe, your
honor. Dicko was the inspiration of my
life’s work, after my return home. I am
truly grateful to his memory, and I rejoice
that I was able to prevail upon you not to
destroy him that morning. All my birds
have been named ‘Dicko,’ in his honor. By
the way, sir—allow me to present you with
your watch. I refrained from parting with
it—out of personal esteem for yburself, sir.
Good-bye, sir—and my best wishes for health
and long life. Good-bye, sir—good-bye.”
