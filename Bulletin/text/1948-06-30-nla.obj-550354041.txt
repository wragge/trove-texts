two miles from Newport,
Monmouthshire, was at one time a
Roman fortress and garrison known to
them as Isca. Excavations have proved
that the fortress was first established
about A.D. 75 at the time of the final
pacification of Wales by the Romans.
A Welsh chronicler, Gerald of Barry,
described Caerleon in the year 1188 as
“a handsome city built of masonry, with
courses of bricks, by the Romans.”
Many vestiges of its former splendour
may yet be seen, immense palaces,
formerly ornamented with gilded roofs,
in imitation of Roman magnificence—
“a town of prodigious size, remarkable
hot baths, relics of temples and theatres,
all enclosed within fine walls, parts of
which remain standing.”
Today it is not easy to visualise the
extent and character of the ancient fort-
ress, built by the second August Legion,
consisting of between 5,000 and 6,000
men, although fragments of the defensive
walls enclosing an area of fifty acres can
still be traced.
Near these walls are the remains of the
Amphitheatre, pictured here. It con-
sists of an arena, oval in shape, 184 feet
long and 136 i feet broad, but all that
remains is the earthen bank, which rose
to a maximum height of 28 feet above
the arena floor, about which were ranged
tiers of timbered seats. Access to the
seats was gained by eight vaulted en-
trances, two of which can be seen in the
picture. Here, as in other Roman
Amphitheatres, was the scene of gladia-
torial combats, the baiting of animals and
the torture of prisoners.
Amongst the numerous relics' found
during the excavations are Roman coins,
pottery, inscriptions and a statuette of
Mercury, which are preserved in the
Legionary Museum at Caerleon.

CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS.
William Hart-Smith’s Christopher Col-
umbus (Caxton Press; Angus and
Robertson) opens with the mildly humor-
ous lines: —
Said Bishop Cosmas,
The world is flat,
and that’s that!
In itself the little prologue is nothing
very much; pleasant, amusing, slight.
And if this Bishop Cosmas is the Cosmas
Indicopleustes of Alexandria who, after
sailing the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean,
became a monk and in the year 548 wrote
a work to denounce the damnable doc-
trine of the rotundity of the earth, main-
taining that the world was a rectangular
plane, with heaven supported by the sky,
the Garden of Eden lying beyond the
sea and the sun revolving round a moun-
tain in the north, Hart-Smith might well
have done more with him.
But that is to regard the prologue in
isolation, and it is not meant to be so
judged. It is the tuning-up of the violins,
an introduction to what is described as
“a sequence of poems” about Columbus ;
an effective reminder of antiquity’s lunatic
notions of geography.
In the second poem of the series, “The
Garden of Delight,” the theme is devel-
oped. We are brought with a rush from
the sixth century to the fifteenth, the
time of Columbus, and geography is still
much enlivened by fantasy: —
Facts are facts, Admiral;
nevertheless
we, the cartographers,
are never at a loss.
‘Here are mermaids, here
are men with tails.
The palace of the Great Khan
hath emerald walls.’
Already, in the first thirty or forty
lines of his sequence, Hart-Smith has
become impressive; he has established
not only a bizarre world for Columbus
to sail in but an enchanting world for
the reader to explore. Perhaps in “The
Garden of Delights,” as elsewhere in the
sequence, there is a debt to Kenneth
Slessor. One may recall from, say, “The
Atlas” lines such —
The seas were full of Dolphins’ fins,
Full of swept bones and flying Jinns,
Beaches were filled with Anthropophagi
And Antient Africa with Palanquins.
But the debt is not one of borrowed
lines or phrases ; |t is a similarity of tone
arising from a wholly justifiable simil-
arity of theme, Kenneth Slessor threw
the high seas open to any Australian poet
who chose to sail them.
In technique, too, it seems that Hart-
Smith may owe something to Slessor.
Once again there is no direct borrowing
that could be a matter for adverse criti-
cism. The debt, if it exists, is only in
clarity, in melody, in the touch of humor,
in an exquisite precision in the use of
words, in subtlety of rhyme and rhythm.
It is that Hart-Smith’s poetry, like Sles-
sor’s, reminds one that art has, after all,
something to do with beauty.
And if “The Garden of Delights” in-
dicates one of the sources of Hart-Smith’s
poetry, it also demonstrates one of his
strongest claims to originality. Writing
such as this: —
This is an approximate
idea only. Our, maps
always maintain an element of
mystery. Continent shapes
are not finally fixed,
pin-pointed as we would like,
degree unto degree. Certainly,
accuracy we seek...
is undoubtedly prosy, and the inversion
of “accuracy we seek” is strangely in-
appropriate in a style that seeks Tor the
directness of spoken language. But the
writing does seek that directness; Hart-
Smith is attempting to solve one of the
most difficult problems of narrative
poetry —how to use ordinary speech with-
out falling into bathos; how to make a
man talk naturally in rhyme—and when
the verse develops into
Here are mermaids, here
are men with tails.
The palace of the Great Khan
hath emerald walls
the method justifies itself. Out of a
prosaic method has come poetry.
In the third poem, “The Brothers
Columbus, Mapmakers of Lisbon,” where
the speech is more fluent and where the
discipline of rhyme is less severe, Hart-
Smith does better still. Here, for the
first time, his full ppwers become appar-
ent. “The Brothers Columbus,” though
unrhymed, is as smooth and as easy to
commit to the memory as rhymed verse
(perhaps because “day” might pass as a
distant sort of rhyme or assonance for
“sea” and “went” for “talent” and even
“arm” for “vellum”) and the verse is lit
with color and dramatised with emotion:
Bartolomeo took him by the arm
and said, ‘My brother, would you sit all day
and soak into your soul the smell of vellum
and parchment-paper? Come, let’s breathe the
sea!’
Bartolomeo gently placed his hand
upon his brother’s shoulder as they went,
and said, ‘lt seems I have the greater talent,
that is all, for making maps. And why?
Because I shut the world out when I werk.’
‘Green ink,’ he thought, as they walked in
silence,
‘is but green ink to me. My brother dips
his pen instead into the Western Sea.’
He said aloud,
‘Brother, is it thus that when you dip
for gold you plunge your quill into the sun?’
“You plunge your quill into the sun!”
... a fine image, and a daring one: for
Hart-Smith Is unconciously speaking of
himself as well as of Columbus. To write
this poem he has had to dip his pen into
the sea and into the sun, and he has
dipped to extraordinarily good purpose.
The fifth poem of the sequence, “Cip-
angu,” is truly written in sea-water and
the sun’s flame. In two concluding lines
of an intensity that makes one remember
“A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a
horse!” there is summed up the whole
history of the adventurers, the urgency of
the great spirits that have given mankind
its Americas of art as well as of geo-
graphy:—
Elbows in wine-slops, news of the ocean isles
they tell in taverns under a stinking lamp.
Madre de Dios, here is evidence!
And once a swollen corpse, a woman’s,
naked, tattooed, face-down in a scum
of jellyfish and weed...
And bits of wood to Santo sometimes come,
most strangely carved.
The woman drowned, they say, had almond
eyes.
Masters, a ship, a ship, for my youth dies!
The next poem, “The Surrender of the
Moors at Granada,” does not, on the
surface, appear to refer to Columbus at
all. Columbus was in Granada on two
critical occasions in career: once,
in January, 1492, when he saw the sur-
render of the city and, befriended by
Juan Perez, who had been Queen Isa-
bella’s confessor, thought that at long
last,, after he had asked Portugal and
England for a ship and had intended, in
desperation, to try his luck with France,
Spain was going to help him ; and again
in April, 1492, when, after he had set
out in bitter disappointment for France,
a messenger with a promise of Isabella’s
support overtook him at the bridge of
Pinos. Nothing of that struggle is con-
veyed in Hart-Smith’s “Surrender” poem,
and, though there is a note of triumph
in it, it does not appear to refer to the
triumph of Columbus.
“The Surrender” is, in one respect,
unique in Australian poetry in that it
seems to be written under the influence
of Ezra Pound’s Cantos. One may com-
pare, both for cadence and for pictorial
method, any section of the Cantos :
The light now, not of the sun.
Chrysophrase,
And the water green clear, and blue clear.
And the boat drawn without sound,
Without odour of ship-work,
Nor bird-cry, nor any noise of wave moving...
with Hart-Smith’s:
Billow the white robes of the Moors,
and the rhythm of the riders slow,
a tired rhythm...
Folded into folds the purple mountains
with their white embroideries of snow.
Folded into folds the emblems of our banners.
Though one is glad that the whole of
Christopher Columbus is not written in
this style there is no harm in Hart-Smith’s
thus trying out Pound’s methods for a
particular effect, and there may be some
profit. Presumably the vast jigsaw-puzzle
of the Cantos is destined to be of some
use to somebody, and not merely as a
dreadful warning; and certainly “The
Surrender” is a rich and haunting piece
of work, more like a painting than a
poem. But Hart-Smith has picked up
here some of Pound’s wilful obscurity
as well as his plastic technique, and in
that there is no profit. If the writer is
not able to make clear within the confines
of the poem what it is all about, he should
at least provide notes.
However, unless he has had some
general and admirable effect on the whole
sequence in the matter of color, Ezra
Pound disappears with “The Surrender,”
and in “Capitulation” and “Departure”
Hart-Smith and Columbus take the
the wheel again: Columbus with triumph
and then “a great calmness,” Hart-Smith
with a minor flaw in the rhyming of
“recovered” with “discovered” and with
a fine technical and psychological exact-
ness in the lines:
Being at last on our way,
a great calmness came upon my soul,
as if all creation waited on my will.
I was at that moment made whole.
The preludes over, we go voyaging with
Columbus. There are two poems, both
good, about seagulls, and there are two
poems, both excellent, “Splice” and “The
Waterspout,” about “the stupefying
emptiness of sea,” Lines of direct speech,
either by Columbus or the sailors, are
skilfully used to make the verses strike
dramatically as well as poetically:
Forward lay sunlight silver on the sea;
behind, the darkness of a cavern;
from it a wind, and cloud-arms over the wind
towards the ship.
They saw a rope of cloud twist down
and a tongue of sea drawn up as the whirlwind
blew,
drinking the ocean up in a plume of foam.
‘Santa Maria, 100k!...h0w far is home!’
And some knelt down, some checked their
blasphemy,
eyes wide and mouths wide, dumb.
Columbus, watching, touched his brow and
breast.
‘Christ be with us!’ he said, as the ship sped
west.
There are other incidents of the voyage.
We meet Columbus, in a verse that en-
larges, a little, our knowledge of his
character, talking benignly to a crab in
a bottle; and suddenly, when we are
confronted with the spectacle of all man-
kind, like the crab, “clawing in vain
Truth’s crystal sides,” the poem deepens
and becomes luminous. There are hints
of mutiny, a poem on the treachery of
Martin Alonzo Pinzon, and three poems
on the first landfall in the New World:
verses which lack something in weight,
in drama and characterisation, but which
paint clear pictures, sharply and sen-
sitively observed:
The light of flambeaux burning on the beach
writhes across the water to our ship
which seems to point sharp swords of liquid
gold;
laughter is heard from the naked Indians.
And I must time my breathing with the waves;
each lifts us gently now and shoreward runs
to scrabble there with phosphorescent nails
where travail ends and Paradise begins.
The rest of the sequence is, summed-
up, the tragedy of Columbus; the dis-
covery of the serpents in his Paradise. In
“Neptune’s Horses” Hart-Smith takes a
conventional theme and, using the asson-
ance of “ship” and “kick” to serve for
the essential spearpoint of rhyme, gives
it fresh vigor when the horses come up
from cropping their trees of kelp and
kick
with mighty shuddering kick
our helpless ship.
In “The Storm” we see Columbus in
torment, on his return journey to Spain,
fearing that all will be lost and praying in
lines as exquisite as a flash of light that
the ocean be as it was
when we went out across the Ocean Sea,
Westward; let it be as a field of corn
yellow in the sun, a cloth of gold, a carpet of
light
golden-calm for my homecoming.
There is a “Psalm for Himself” on
his arrival in Spain, a portrayal of
triumph bursting through a screen of
humility, but the movement towards
tragedy is shown powerfully when one of
the parrots brought from the New World
suddenly makes to shriek out
a sound as of mortal agony...
and again in a lament, all the more mov-
ing for its tinge of humor, for an Indian
who dies in Spain and who, the first of
his race to have been admitted to Sal-
vation, “will be lonely in Heaven.”
In some of his earlier poems, searching
for subtlety and delicacy, Hart-Smith
dispensed with rhyme altogether and lost
thereby the point, the finish, the memor-
ableness, the perfection of lyrical
form which depends on the correspond-
ence of sounds. Throughout Christopher
Columbus he has, to the vital improve-
ment of his poetry, returned to rhyme of
various kinds. His best effects:
drinking the ocean up in a plume of foam.
‘Santa Maria, look!.. .how far is home!’ —
come from the old, conventional, correct
rhymes, but these ring with fresh melody
because they are contrasted with the
quieter music of half-rhymes and asson-
ances. In the balance of tradition and
experiment the writer has found the
subtlety he sought. “He Will Be Lonely
in Heaven,” though it seems to need one
of the poet’s dramatising correct rhymes
to complete its impact, is an example of
the remarkable care with which this
sequence has been written. Except for
“sin” and “herein” there are no con-,
ventional rhymes, yet an effect of rhyme
is given by line-endings such as
“Heaven,” “Indian,” “Juan,” “nine,”
“return,” “brethren,” “million,” “Eden.”
Every line of this poem ends with the
letter “n,” so that it has, if not exactly
rhyme, an intriguing harmony.
In the curious, prose-like style em-
ployed earlier in “The Garden of
Delights” Hart-Smith proceeds to follow
Columbus on his second voyage, the nar-
native, when it appears to be sinking into
flatness or into the mere facile cutting-up
into lines of verse the prose of the navi-
gator’s journal, always deepening just in
time with the savage spectacle of death or
becoming lyrical with trumpets. The
section ends, in silence, at the fort of La
Navidad established on the first voyage
and, in the interim, destroyed with its
guard by the Indians. There would be
no welcome, Columbus found:
neither from our kindred,
nor from the Indians,
who ran away and hid themselves.
Then, at last
the place where he had built the tower
and no tower there.
In the next poem, “The Land of Man-
gon,” the 27th of the series, the theme
of “The Garden of Delights” returns:
the strangeness and enchantment of the
New World, where anything might be
discovered and where facts are not quite
facts. One of Columbus’s men goes
ashore and sees a lake with great white
lilies and a man in a long white robe
with tall attendants. But this time the
facts must be investigated:
Columbus sent two parties to explore;
One found three stately cranes and nothing
more.
As the dream changes to reality a
flaw in the character of Columbus is
revealed ; his uneasy justification of him-
self for sending, to a Court hungry for
gold, Indian slaves. And then, tainting
the whole of the New World with “lep-
rous rot and slow decay,” there is
syphilis: an unpromising theme from
which Hart-Smith extracts a macabre and
tragic beauty.
Columbus founds the city of Isabella,
governing the colony for Spain; his
enemies multiply, threaten his security—
Faggots, Bartholomew;
they pile the burning-wood!
he rages at the petty cares of government,
and gladly he sets out on his third voyage,
during the course of which, lost in a
fog, he provides Hart-Smith with one of
his loveliest lyrics, a poem about pearls
and mist that is itself a pearl in a mist:
...and all the sails hang limp.
The ship is the core of a pearl;
we are enclosed.
Lord God, the mist; there is no need of it
here on your ocean sea, for we
are already lost. t .
It has its own
mysterious sound, and you call
the softest murmur of a girl’s
lips speech, then this is all
one continuous whisper whispering. ,.
Here fine gold hair upon my wrist
grows pearls.
Lord God, the mist,
and we, already lost.
It is this sort of thing, the distillation
of experience, the recreation in glowing
and crystalline poetry of the crucial in-
cidents of Columbus’s life, that Hart-Smith
does supremely well. For further
examples one could take the ironical
little stanza about the Hidalgo who swore
that he would spit with his lance thirteen
Indians every day, or the lyric about the
goatherd whom Columbus sees on his
return to Spain—in irons: an incident
hardly given its full dramatic value—
after his fourth voyage. In its place in
the sequence, after the troubles and dis-
asters, the rage and disillusion and agony,
“The Goatherd,” with its pastoral tran-
quillity and charm —
Below in the valley lies his shepherd’s hut
white among plumes of cypresses;
he hears the skylark sprinkle merrily
a fistful of fairy coin upon the earth...
invites comparison, at a suitable distance,
with the great and lovely soliloquy in
the third part of “Henry the Sixth” which
comes, after all the turmoil that has pre-
ceded it, with the grace of a bene-
diction :
Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how
lovely!
Gives not the hawthorn bush a sweeter shade
To shepherds looking on their silly sheep
Than doth a rich embroidered canopy
To kings that fear their subjects’ treachery?
It is something, and no mean achieve-
ment, to be Shakspearean for a line or
two, or in a single effect. But even a
work that is submitted as “a sequence of
poems” must be judged for its total effect.
Like Francis Webb’s A Drum for Ben
Boyd, Hart-Smith’s “sequence,” following
Columbus from his first dreams of
grandeur to his old age when people say
of him “Who is that madman, that
peculiar one?” is an attempt at poetry
on the grand scale, the epic. It is too
fragmentary in its episodes, too elusive
as a story, too sketchy in characterisation
wholly to succeed. It is finer in pure
poetry than in dramatisation. And yet
the individual poems read more impres-
sively in their setting than they previously
did when published separately; the
whole, as it should be, is greater than the
parts. The work comes astonishingly
close to succeeding as an epic.
Structure apart, the sequence is wholly
a delight. It is like color and music
bubbling up out of time; a rare and
beautiful achievement and one that is
likely to endure.

What is the legend of the Flying
Dutchman ?
The Flying Dutchman is a phantom
ship, which, in consequence of a
murder committed on board, is sup-
posed to haunt the sea in a perpetual
endeavor to make Table Bay. Super-
stitious sailors declare that it is seen
in stormy weather off the Cape of
Good Hope, and forebodes disaster.
Capt. F. Marryat’s The Phantom Ship
and a music drama •by Richard
Wagner are founded on this legend.

was the Australian Cricket Board of
Control formed?
(1) Each member of the team sub-

(2) The Board of Control was formed
in 1905 by N.S.W., Qld. and Vic.
Assns. South Aus. joined in 1906-07,
Tas. in 1907, and West Aus. in 1914-

Treatment for aphis and mildew
on rose plants?
Aphis can be controlled by spray-
ing with nicotine (residue from old
cigarette butts soaked in a little water
will do) or Black Leaf 40; two days
after treatment wash the plants with
a strong hose jet. For mildew, as
soon as detected, dust the leaves,
under and over, with sulphur or spray
with Harbas or one of the trade
preparations on the market, letting
the mixture run down the stem to
the earth. Treat in the early morning,
when the sun will dry the mixture
on the leaves for best results.

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
Murder in the Lords.
Unluckily for any of them
that might have benefited,
murderers did not hold off while
House of Lords and House of
Commons; considered the sus-
pending of capital punishment
for an experimental period of
five years'.
Several particularly ugly mur-
ders no doubt helped influence
the Lords to ditch the measure
passed in the other House on a
non-party vote. Some interest-
ing points were made in the
Lords’ debate.
Lord Samuel favored allow-
ing capital punishment for mur-
der in general to lapse, but sug-
gested retaining it for four
classes of crime: political assas-
sination, murder of policemen
carrying out their duty, murder
of prison officers by convicts in
their charge, and crimes of long
premeditation or exceptional
atrocity. (London “Times,” in
editorial comment, suggested
adding to these “a second mur-
der by a convict who had been
reprieved and eventually re-
leased.”)
In opposing the experimental
measure, Viscount Simon said he
“did not remember a case where
the indications of the mass of
the people about a particular
proposal had been expressed in
so remarkably positive a man-
ner” —that is, against it. In his
view, a contract had been made
with the private citizen who was
deeply grieved when one he
loved had been murdered ; the
contract, in effect, being; “You
must restrain your actions, and
give up all idea of vengeance,
and leaye matters to the just
administration of the law, and
Nve will see that the convicted
murderer is duly and effectively
dealt with.”
Stating that “Never in the last
100 years had there been such an
outbreak of crimes of violence
accompanied by use of lethal
weapons,” Lord Goddard
touched on the question of
whether this was “due merely to
the war or to the general slack-
ening of discipline and sense of
responsibility.” He thought it
was due to both causes. He dis-
agreed, however, with one
speaker who, in favor of the
proposed measure, had referred
to commando-training. In the
two and a half years in which he
had been president of the Court
of Criminal Appeal, Lord God-
dard said he had dealt with 500
or 600 cases, and not until the
other day had a single case of
a commando come before the
Court.
Further to the commando-
training fallacy, Lord Goddard
pointed out that commandos
were hand-picked men, and were
subjected to strong and rigorous
discipline and profited by it. “It
brought discipline into their
lives.” And, he added,. “The
outbreak of violence is not due
to people becoming used to
lethal weapons but to the break-
down of discipline that has per-
vaded all classes of the com-
munity.”
War or Peace?
Up to the sharp worsening of
feeling between the West and
Russia over the division of Ger-
many, former U.S. Under-
secretary of State Sumner
Welles had been a lone voice
in asserting in N. Y. “Herald
Tribune” that “while many
correspondents report an appar-
ent abatement, there are in
reality signs! of intensified Soviet
activity in every part of Europe,
in Asia and the Near East and
the Americas.”
According to Welles, reports
had been “flooding certain
foreign offices of Western
Europe which assert that the
Soviet Government plans to
force a showdown before next
autumn. They warn that Mos-
cow is preparing for a move in
September before the European
Recovery Programme can have
much concrete effect, and before
American rearmament has made
any progress. Documents have
been received which purport to
be detailed Russian plans for the
occupation of major Western
cities, especially those of Scan-
dinavia, France and Italy.”
That was far from being the
lately-prevalent view. Despite
Palestine and the very danger-
ous position in Germany, where
there have been frequent “in-
cidents” any one of which a
dozen years ago would have
broken the peace, the feeling in
America was that the real trend
in world affairs is not now to-
wards but away from war.
A correspondent of N. Y.
“Times” in Berlin, Drew Middle-
ton, went so far as to visualise
the Bear trying its hand at
appeasing: “It appears that the
rulers of Russia, moved by
American rearmament and the
economic weakness of their own
country, have embarked on a
period in which attempts will
be made to appease the United
States.”
Also, the same ably-served
paper’s chief European corres-
pondent, C. L. Sulzberger, ask-
ing “Does Moscow really wish
an easing of the world situ-
ation?” held that there is “good
reason to believe that the answer
is in the affirmative.” Among
grounds for this optimism, Sulz-
berger stated: “The Soviet popu-
lace is weary, its nerves are on
edge after a long and fierce
struggle, its wounds are not yet
healed.”
Other reasons the correspon-
dent analysed include the follow-
ing: The Soviet Union is no
more prepared for war than the
United States. Its coal and
steel production is still below
pre-war level. Its oil produc-
tion has not recovered. Because
the tractor output has not yet
attained the appointed target
levels the agricultural output is
not what Moscow would like.
The Soviet Union has no surface
fleet worth mentioning, rela-
tively few long-range bombers
and a slow production level, and,
as far as is known, no atomic
weapons. Also, “An extended
period of world peace would be
likely to cool the current inter-
ventionist ardor in the United
States. That would play nicely
into Moscow’s hands.”
Repeating an earlier statement
(despite official denials) that
“peace feelers in the ‘cold war’
were first put out by Russia in
January,” the “U.S. News and
World Report” stated that “a
Russian marshal, with the rank
of Ambassador, in Berlin sought
a conference with Robert
Murphy, political adviser to the
U.S. Military Government in
Germany, and, in the course of
a conference lasting from 8 in
the evening till 2 in the morning,
went over in detail the differ-
ences dividing the U.S. and
Russia ; the Soviet representative
proposing a meeting between
Truman and Stalin. This was
rebuffed by top U.S. officials,
and the Russian moves in
Czechoslovakia and Finland
followed. Elsewhere, however —
in Berlin, in Italy and Norway—•
Russian moves failed ; the, sum
total being reckoned a consider-
able Russian defeat.”
“U.S. News and World
Report” forecast that, though no
rapid end of the “cold war”
is to be expected, Russia
would retreat slowly, bargaining
as much as possible, and thus
“Slow progress towards peace,
considered impossible last year,
is now developing behind the
scenes.” As it put it, “Peace
is trying to break out,” the
problem of both the U.S. and
Russia being “how to get peace
through compromises that are
mutually beneficial.” The pub-
lication insisted that Russia “has
been putting out peace feelers
for several months.”
There is, however, one serious
snag, noted by another N. Y.
“Times” correspondent in Wash-
ington—that the real trouble is
not that U.S. officials are un-
willing to discuss issues with the
Kremlin, but that they “frankly
do not rely on agreements with
the Soviet Union after they are
made.”
Meanwhile the U.S. is not be-
ing lulled into a sense of false
security by Kremlin peace-propa-
ganda, but is going ahead with
rearmament, holding to the
stand affirmed by Sumner
Welles: “Any attempt on our
part to negotiate an overall
settlement before the Politburo
knows that American rearma-
ment has taken place would be
a fatal mistake. The Soviet Gov-
ernment will only conclude the
kind of settlement that can make
for lasting peace when it has be-
come convinced that the strength
and the tenacity of the West are
equal to its own. A negotiation
now would either end in a futile
compromise by appeasement or
in a stalemate that would serve
Moscow as a pretext for further
expansion.”
Treaty-breaking.
N. Y. “Times” has given a
full-page of small type to an
extraordinary official exposure
of specific instances of Soviet
treaty-breaking.
In this speciality, the Kremlin
appears to beat Hitler hollow,
and the Fiihrer wasn’t exactly a
novice at it.
The exposure resulted from a
request by 31 American Senators
to the State Department for
specific instances of treaty
abuses by the Russians to which
President Truman had referred
in a speech before Congress.
That was the speech in which
President Truman declared:
“The agreements we did obtain,
imperfect though they were,
could have furnished the basis
for a just peace if they had been
kept. But they were not kept.
They have been persistently
ignored and violated by one
nation.”
The State Department obliged
with a list of instances number-
ing more than the total of the
Senators who asked ior them.
No fewer than 37 violations ,
concerning Germany, Austria,
Eastern and South-eastern
Europe, Korea and Manchuria?.
The Department’s statement
gave exact particulars of every
agreement and its violation.
Food for Britain.
“In England today,” writes
Charles Graves in a “Saturday
Evening Post” article, “lard is a
thing of beauty and a joy for as
long as it lasts.”
“Lard, of course,” Graves
adds, “simply means fat, a pro-
duct that is tremendously im-
portant in England now, especi-
ally in the families of profes-
sional men, who have no access
to factory canteens. The finest
"food package I ever received
from friends in the United States
held just two items —and both
were seven-pound tins of lard.”
Written to guide Americans,
some of Graves’s further com-
ments should be helpful pointers
for the many thousands of Aus-
tralian parcel-senders, too, if they
can get over the sort of offici-
ousness that puts restrictions on
how much fat they can send.
“I would name lard and
butter,” he insists, “as the two
most valuable contents of any
food package. Next in import-
ance would be any type of
tinned meat. Third would be
rice ; then powdered milk, dried
eggs, cheese, brown sugar, jam,
honey and tea, in about that
order. Where there are children
in the family, tinned butter, jam
and honey, dried fruit and cake
mixtures are usefql because they
help make the nursery tea, the
last meal of the day for children.
But where there are no children,
lard is invaluable for use in
cooking our endless fish dishes.
“To appreciate the importance
of lard in England, just cut out
an ounce of lard and remind
yourself that this is a week’s
allowance for one civilian.
Along with two ounces of butter
and four ounces of margarine—
reversed each week —this makes
up most of our fat allowance.
We have no cooking or salad
oils, and little fat meat can be
had. The weekly meat ration
will buy one diminutive chop.
Tinned meat is especially appre-
ciated.
“Cheese, dried eggs, powdered
milk and tea always are wel-
come items. Our cheese ration
is two ounces a week; our egg
ration is supposed to provide an
egg a week, but seldom does.
We get two ounces of tea a week,
so naturally, to a tea-drinking
nation, a few extra ounces are
far more appreciated than sweets
or pastry mixtures.”
And, above all, lard! “Re-
cently,” says Graves, “a man
in Manchester was reported to
have exchanged his great-aunt
for a pound of lard, but this
seems an exaggerated value.
Probably he got only half a
pound.”
Shackled by Planning.
A letter from “a well-informed
British observer,” quoted editori-
ally by “Wall-street Journal,”
touches on differences between
nationalisation and planning and
holds planning to be the greater
evil ;
“Nationalisation is a mono-
poly problem which is likely to
give Britain some severe head-
aches later on, but at present isn’t
the real difficulty. What the
British economy is mainly suf-
fering from today is planning
expressed in Government regu-
lations and controls which bog
down the whole economy, both
nationalised and private enter-
prise, and it is also crippled with
a distorting repressed inflation.
The Government is trying
to run the country largely by
physical controls which bog
down production. It is these
controls which employ an enor-
mous number of civil servants
who exercise them and also in-
volve another large number of
employees in industry and trade
who have to deal with the num-
berless forms and regulations,
issued by the various Govern-
ment departments. All this
manpower is diverted from pro-
duction jobs at a time when in-
dustry is crying out for man-
power.”
■lt hardly calls for any poet’s
frenzy to give that set-up a local
habitation and a name, or to
find a nearer application for the
“Journal’s” summing-up:
“It is this thing called ‘plan-
ning’ and the ‘managed eco-
nomy’ which is paralysing
Britain. Its silly and cumber-
some rules, its priorities, its
rationing and its inevitable
bottlenecks are killing initiative
and incentive in Britain just as
they have always killed it wher-
ever they have been tried.”
German Partition.
With the US., Britain and
France (the French by the very
doubting vote of 297 to
289) at last decided on the
organising of what will become
eventually a Western German
State, naturally they are out-
and-out villains in the eyes of
the Kremlin. As a Berlin cor-
respondent of N. Y. “Times”
has pointed out, Germany has,
all through, been the biggest
objective in Soviet foreign
policy ; domination there mean-
ing more to Russian plans than
the domination of any other
country.
Instead of that objective being
achieved, the formation of the
Western State, the correspondent
concludes, may make impossible
for decades to come Russian
domination of Germany.
Hence the furious Kremlin
attacks on the moves of the
other Powers to set up a Western
Germany that will be a separate
working concern, with its own
Government (under occupation
control), a new currency, and
also inclusion as a most im-
portant contributing and receiv-
ing country in the Marshall
Plan.
The question is whether the
Kremlin can accept what it is
now faced with. “A Western
German State, introduced into
the concert of Western Europe,
will prosper because of its great
natural resources and the sus-
tenance of other countries of
Western Europe and the United
States.”
The Russians fear the effects
of such prosperity in a country
adjoining the Soviet zone; a
relatively high standard of liv-
ing being a challenge that the
Russians cannot now meet: “A
prosperous Western German
State.... .will offer an attraction
to the countries of Central and
Eastern Europe.... the
Russians cannot counter.”*

“Times” has editorially commented;

Basic U.S. Policy—As summarised
by “U.S. News and World Re-
port” : “Russian tactics aim at
disruption abroad. Fifth-column
activities, the stirring of civil war,
strikes, discontent, all are part of
the Russian method. U.S., on its side,
has no alternative to resisting Russian
tactics. Talks with Stalin, words,
agreements, contracts won’t mean a
thing until the Russians are stopped,
until they face barriers that do not
give under pressure. U.S. must stop
Russia -before any basis can be laid
for peace. That’s the theory. It rests
on the assumption that Russia will push
to the point of war, but will stop just
short of war. If Russia is not stopped
short of war, then the theory is that
a basis for peace can be laid after the
Russians are defeated in war.”

Jewish Tribute. —From a London
“Times” letter signed by 13 leading
“members of the Anglo-Jewish Com-
munity”: “We believe that history,
which alone sees events in their true
perspective, will ultimately recognise
and record the deep obligation of
Jewry to Great Britain in this
[Palestine] as in so many other fields.
We earnestly trust that, when time
has healed the scars of the present
lamentable conflict, the Jews of
Palestine will again turn to this coun-
try for guidance and C9unsel, and that
the people of Great Britain will accord
them their goodwill in the difficult
years ahead.”

Churchill oh the U.S. From a
speech by Mr. Churchill in London:
“If prices are high there [in the U.S.],
that is largely because of the immense
exertions they are making, without
return, in relief of other countries
and the streng provision they are
making for the armed defence of free-
dom all over the world. We must not
be under any delusions as to what is
preserving peace and security in the
world. It is the power and strength
of the United States.’’

KING COAL'S FIDDLERS.
Following, their customary practice,
the Chifley Socialist Ministry ducked for
shelter into recess before the coal crisis
developed last week.
Privations which industries and house-
holders in Victoria and South Australia
have been enduring for months on short
coal rations will now increase in severity,
and New South Wales must henceforth
prepare to share them. The Communist
leaders of the Miners’ Federation are
in position to put most of Australia
under the sort of blockade that other
Communist union-bosses imposed on
Queensland in February and March, and
the starvation of the Commonwealth’s
wider working economy is about to begin.
When the miners won’t work, nobody
shall have the right to work. This is the
recipe for the revolution. The show-
down with the whole traitorous set-
up, whose steady sabotage of the
nation’s working resources the Can-
berra Government has tolerated for
years, and even encouraged by its dis-
graceful pandering to them, is now im-
minent and inevitable. What makes it
the more menacing to the country is that
the Chifley “Government” will not, can-
not, dare not assert its authority against
these wreckers. It is so entangled in the
Communists’ web of political blackmail,
aiming at just this result, that it has no
authority left for the public’s defence
against the consequences.
From the end of 1942 (the invasion-
scare year), when 17,100 miners produced
12,280,000 tons of coal and strikes lost
only 901,909 tons (bad enough), this is
how the story has run, with numbers em-
ployed increased by some hundreds:
Output Loss by strikes
(tons). (tons).
1943 .. .. 11,473,000 1,294,884
1944 .. .. 11,042,000 1,524,567
1945 .. .. 10,176,000 2,347,469
1946 .. .. 11,186,000 1,347,392
1947 .. .. 11,683,000 1,671,206
1948 (rate) .. 10,000,000 1,945,652
So far this year the weekly wastage
through stoppages has been about 20
per cent, of possible output.
In order to reach the position where,
reserves being wiped out, the community
could be held to ransom, this is an ex-
ample, from last year, of how the miners’
leaders behaved:
In August, 1947, they filed a claim for an
extra five days’ Christmas leave, making
three weeks in all. Claim granted by
Tribunal, self-described as “representing the
public,” with the proviso that “the leave
is not to be taken during a time in which
the Joint Coal Board certifies that insuf-
ficient coal stocks are available to meet
the national requirement during the period
of idleness.”
Forthwith widespread stoppages occurred
on the coalfields (one week in mid-
September the losses reached 59,000 tons).
Board supported the Miners’ Federation
after summons by Tribunal to show cause
why leave concessions should not be with-
drawn. Tribunal rejected Board’s sub-
missions, but accepted Federation’s pledges
about conduct, and its agreement to work
alternate Saturdays (at double pay) in order
to provide Christmas stocks.
Miners thereafter said they would take
their three weeks l leave in any event. Stop-
pages on week-days increased; 443,000 tons
lost between September and mid-December,
against 300,000 tons mined on nine back-
Saturdays at “enormous expense” (owners’
statement).
When miners returned to work on Janu-
ary 12, 1948, stoppages promptly lost 43,000
tons that week. Engine-drivers followed
next week with State-wide strike which lost
another 137,000 tons of coal. There being
no stocks left —industries just got through
the miners’ Christmas spell—gas and rail-
way services were cut and many industries
closed.
That indiscipline set the tune for the
current half-year. The Coal Tribunal
describes the position today as “intoler-
able,” and is answered by a demand from
the Federation for higher rates for
wheelers. Leading mines were thrown
idle in protest against the Tribunal’s
rejection of a claim for higher contract
pay. Working (nominally) less than
six hours a day for five days a week,
miners already earn £2 ss. to £2 14s. a
day, and the industry could not carry on
without a heavy annual Federal subsidy
to meet running costs.
With no stocks on hand today and
the latter half of the year approaching,
when, on past experience, miners need to
be coaxed to work enough coal to carry
over three weeks’ idleness at Christmas,
the question is: What will the community
have to pay to be free from the threat
of. complete cessation of all services
(through lack of coal) from mid-
December to the end of the first week
in January? What will the ransom have
to be —that is, on top of the price to be
exacted by Mr. Chifley’s “philosophers”
for coal to relieve the earlier prospect of
starvation rations from now till Christ-
mas?
Before these developments Mr. Chifley
and Mr. McGirr, joint “controllers” of
the industry, remain inactive save for
“appeals” to the miners to accept their
own special arbitration tribunals, “which
otherwise may be entirely wasted.” Of
demand for discipline in this arrogant
union in return for the benefits granted
if there isn’t a whisper. The squibs at
Canberra have long made play with the
bluff that only “Labor” could get coal
from the miners, with the sobstuff that
they must not be “crucified” by being
compelled to obey the law or industrial
awards, and the general alibi that in-
discipline could be properly and best
controlled by the Miners’ Federation
officials themselves —even to levying of
fines inflicted (and no doubt handed back
after hours through the back window).
Their Joint Coal Board—intended to
show how much better Governments
could run the industry than the mine-
owners did —has done nothing for
months but wring its hands because
miners will not observe pledges to observe
awards; and it aroused rude laughter
when, as the miners entered on their
holidays last Christmas, it “thanked them
for their efforts”! The public can com-
pute how much this “authority” weighs
with the Communists of the coalfields by
its most recent experience:
In April last the Board “deplored the
Federation’s failure” to fulfil promises to
curtail strikes and announced th?se de-
cisions in an Order duly proclaimed:—
(1) Conciliation committees to be set up
at mines.
(2) Owners required to keep mines open
unless the Board approved of closing them.
(3) Colliery managers directed to be
available at end of each day’s shift to
discuss any matter employees might wish.
(4) Managers not to discuss matters in
dispute during a strike.
(5) Board to apply to Tribunal for more
stringent provisions to annual leave and
holiday payments.
The Communist boss of the Federation
promptly threatened direct action unless
Numbers (1) and (5) of the Order were
withdrawn (that is to say, the disciplining
of mine managers only was to be tolerated);
and the Board immediately climbed down
and obeyed. The Federation promised once
again that it would eliminate petty stop-
pages, and in the two months petty
stoppages lost another 250,000 tons of coal.
Mr. Baddeley in N.S.W. State Cabinet
celebrated the Federation’s April threats
with his new Miners’ Pensions Bill, in-
creasing weekly pensions from £2 ss. to
£2 12s. 6d., raising the owners’ subsidy to
the fund from £365,000 a year to £645,000,
and reducing the miners’ total contribu-
tion from two-sevenths to two-ninths.
Over two years ago, in March, 1946,
the Davidson Report gave a “con-
servative estimate” of the capacity out-
put of N.S.W. underground mines at
12.750.000 tons a year, working one shift
only ; and the all-Australian demand for
N.S.W. coal at 12,000,000 tons. Mechan-
isation in pillar-working, the report de-
clared (it is at present prohibited by
Baddeley’s legislation), would, with open-
cut mining, increase capacity output to
14.500.000 tons. The output could be
doubled by working a second shift, as
every other notable coal-producing coun-
try does, but the Miners’ Federation will
not tolerate it, or mechanised extraction
of pillar-coal, either.
The “target” set by the Coal Authority
for this year is 13 million tons. It looks
like getting under 10 million. In a good
year under present systems of working
it apparently could not hope to exceed the
Commonwealth demand of two years ago,
and demand has greatly increased since.
The Chifleys remain unmoved. Not a
gesture out of them. Yet Mr. Chifley
and Mr. Calwell and Mr. Dedman con-
tinue to proclaim to all and sundry the
“magnificent” industrial progress in this
country, the legions of industrial investors
abroad striving to come here and set up
new factories, the drive for millions of
immigrant skilled workers in the shortest
possible time —and yet it is all a delusion
and a snare! There is not a hope for any
fraction of it, and cannot be, without
coal. The stuff these Ministers talk is
just bunkum. The Communists of the
Miners’ Federation have said so, and they
ram it home by showing that Australia,
even while holding out a hand to these
desirable newcomers, is not producing—
is not allowed to produce—enough coal
for its own current needs.
Communist Hell.
In the U.S.A. under the Taft-Hartley Act
no Communist, alien- or native-born,
can hold union office unless the union
abandons the solid advantages secured
for unions by the National Labor Rela-
tions Act; and the number of unions in
that category is small and shrinking. In
Boston last month the United Steel-
workers, greatest of the C. 1.0. organisa-
tions, in an amendment written into their
constitution laid it down that “no member
shall be eligible to serve as an officer,
delegate or committeeman who is a
member, consistent supporter or parti-
cipator in the activities of the Communist
party.”
The relevant part of the Taft-Hartley
Act reads:
No investigation shall be made by the
National Labor Relations Board of any
question raised by a labor organisation
no petition shall be entertained and no
complaint shall be issued, pursuant to a
charge made by a labor organisation, unless
there is on file with the Board an affidavit
by each officer of such labor organisa-
tion and the officers of any national or
international labor organisation of which it
is an affiliate or constituent unit {e.g.,
the A.F.L. and the C. 1.0., which have
Canadian branches] that he is not a mem-
ber of the Communist party or affiliated
with such party, and that he does not be-
lieve in, and is not a member of or sup-
ports, any organisation that believes in or
teaches the overthrow of the United States
Government by force or by any illegal or
unconstitutional methods,
The Taft-Hartley Act contains many
other commonsense provisions pertinent
to the state of affairs in Australia, and
capable, if here adopted and enforced,
of saving it from the doom to which Com-
munists and fellow-travellers have sen-
tenced Australia.
As stated in the preamble, the measure
was designed “to protect the rights of
individual employees in their relations
with labor organisations whose activities
affect commerce, to define and proscribe
practices on the part of labor and
management which affect commerce and
are inimical to the general welfare, and
to protect the rights of the public in con-
nection with labor disputes affecting
commerce,” All this it has done,, and
more. In the result it has found nation-
wide acceptance, and by no section more
than the steady-going unionists and union
groups whom it has preserved from the
savage intimidation and victimisation here
practised with impunity. It has safe-
guarded these steady-going elements also
at the point of their union dues and levies
and the expenditure of union funds (on
which in Australian revolutionary organi-
sations there is no check whatever) and in
numerous other ways. Last year among
Communists, fellow-travellers, so-called
moderates and union bosses there was
great talk of organising the workers for
the repeal of the Act, the dismissal of
Senator Taft from public life and the
defeat of the Republicans in the Presi-
dential and Congressional elections. The
“movement” came to nothing, and is re-
membered now only as a flop.
This great American enactment is a
guarantee of continuance of the mighty
flaw of production which has brought
hope to Europe and other devastated
and threatened parts of the world. It
does not itself outlaw strikes, but where
“the national health or safety is
threatened” it empowers the President to
call for a “cooling-off period” of 60 days,
enforceable by judgment of “any district
Court,” after which “the National Labor
Relations Board shall take a secret ballot
of the employees of each employer in-
volved on the question of whether they
wish to accept the final offer of settle-
ment.” It admits of faithless employers
and unions being sued “in any district
court” for violation of contracts, damages,
where “a labor organisation” is the guilty
party, being “enforceable only against the
organisation and its assets, not against
any individual member or his assets.”
And there is a section (305) which should
at least interest Mr. Chifley and his
164,000 Commonwealth Government em-
ployees, Communists and all, and Mr.
Hollway and his railways, and the Com-
munist boss of the Victorian railwaymen.
Brown;
It shall be unlawful for any individual
employed by the United States or any
agency thereof to participate in any strike.
Any individual [so] employed who strikes
shall be discharged immediately, and shall
forfeit his civil-service status, if any, and
shall not be eligible for re-employment for
three years.
The N.S.W. Liberals have come out
for a ban on the Communist party “and
all organisations similar,” for the ex-
clusion of Communists from the public
service, for union elections by secret ballot
and for secret ballots before strikes,
A pretty good programme as far as it
goes, but it doesn’t go far enough. It is
barren of the other salutary measures by
virtue of which individual unionists, union
minorities, even union majorities, whole
communities and victims of contract (or
award) violation are protected against
wreckers in the U.S.A. Even in our
Communist-controlled unions, as in other
organisations, there are a great many
decent fellows who want to work for their
families and their country and hate what
is going on. They have to “go with the
mob,” for the alternative is insult, assault,
ostracism and persecution of their
womenfolk; all the savage pains and
penalties reserved by Communists and
other union bullies for proclaimed
“scabs.” “Labor,” being without courage,
moral principle or vision—that vision
without which parties, as well as peoples,
perish—leaves them naked to their
enemies, and ours. But so did the
Liberals when power was in their hands.
Communist Heaven.
There has been a long-continued failure
of courage and moral principle in Aus-
tralia, and this accounts for the situation
into which Australia has drifted.
From this general cause spring the
injuries and evils that plague and humi-
liate it —the criminal strikes, the larrikin
slow-motion “work” between stoppages
and the blackmail that hold up shipping,
that halt the movement of food to Britain,
that blockaded Queensland, that deny coal
to industry and transport, gasworks and
power-stations, that stifle production and
housing, that reduce toiling men to idle-
ness toiling women to despair. A
country in such a condition may carry on
for a time, and after a fashion, but to
remain in that condition means calamity.
The failure of courage and moral prin-
ciple has lasted longest, and been most
conspicuous and deadly in its conse-
quences, at Canberra.
In that city a “ ‘Labor’ Government”
has been established for nearly seven
years. It has been in a position all along
to tackle the Communist conspiracy,
which aims at a violent redistribution of
power and loot; and every other English-
speaking Government is tackling the foul
thing. But not this “Government.”
Ever since it reached office this
“ ‘Labor’ Government” has fawned on
Moscow’s instruments. Almost its first
administrative proceeding was to release
two Communists who had been interned
after imprisonment for subversive prac-
tices during the German war —before it
became holy—and this was succeeded by
removal of the ban on Communist
organisations and publications which —
again before the war was made holy by
Hitler’s attack on Stalin, his partner for
nearly 22 months —had campaigned for a
Hitler peace. Nominal conditions were
imposed by the “ ‘Labor’ Government,”
but they were straightway repudiated by
Communist union leaders, and were
never enforced! i
There followed also a ‘Labor”-Com-
munist alliance at two powers refer-
endums and, in between. Communist
sabotage of Australia’s relations with the
Dutch in their East Indies. That outrage,
connived at by “Labor” though “Labor”
pretends to have an independent foreign
policy, has, as the first of its conse-
quences (others are showing up in Malaya
and Burma), retarded recovery for three
years. And, again with the connivance
of “Labor,” there has been a long suc-
cession of poisonous Communist strikes.
Throughout these years the “Labor”
Prime Minister, so far from resorting to
his immense powers by way of shielding
the nation against' Communist wreckers,
has never said a word in reprobation or
criticism of these ruffians. He has never
even mentioned them except to maunder
something about their “philosophy,” in
which his Minister of Labor discovered
Christlike attributes, and about their
right to be protected in their “philo-
sophic” rascalities.
The disgraceful, and in some cases con-
tinuing, employment of Communist
wreckers on “semi-Government ‘work ”
can have no other origin than funk,
fellow-feeling or both. Over £llOO for the
Manchester Irishman Healy, who “repre-
sents” the wharflaborers on the Stevedor-
ing Industry Commission and who must
have been paid (“30s. a day sitting fee
and another 30s. when absent overnight
from home”). for an explosion of
hardened villainy:
Notwithstanding any S.I.C. order or any
law, the Waterside Workers’ Federation still
intends to see that no cargo is moved in
or out of Queensland.
Five hundred and forty-three pounds
for the English-born Communist Elliott
(Seamen’s Union), £533 for the English-
born Communist Thornton (Ironworkers)
and £llB3 for the Welsh-born Communist
Williams. For Williams, who, as general
president of the Miners’ Federation, is
the chief architect of the cruel losses
and miseries which whole communities
are now suffering in the depth of winter.
And the pockets of other Communists
have been lined with tax-money, for only
part of the shameful story has been
dragged out.
Had Williams, Thornton, Elliott, the
Healy from Manchester and the Healy
(ex-McCracken) from Belfast emigrated
to the United States and engaged in
the practices which recommend them
to the Oriental pollution, they wouldn’t
have been there now. And the
most that any of them would have got
from the United States Government
would have been a free passage to the
U.K. or the U.S.S.R. under a deportation
order. Bridges, the “Australian,” saved
himself from expulsion only by swearing
that he was not a Communist. He is
still in danger.


PLAIN ENGLISH
Ignoble Session Ended.
First session of Canberra’s ignominious
Eighteenth Parliament is now in its grave
unwept, unhonored and unsung except in
lampoon. Any excuse was good enough
for its ending, but the one produced hap-
pens to be somebody’s desire that Mr.
McKell, as Governor-General, should
perform a Parliament-opening.
That performance is accordingly
arranged for in a new session, beginning
in September. To the Socialists on the
Treasury benches it should bring the
sobering feeling of going through familiar
movements for the last time. An air of
Government desperation can hardly fail
to invest Parliamentary proceedings'
through the final 12 months, but the
record of the coming session cannot easily
be more disreputable than that of the
session just ended.
The Parliamentary sittings this year
were sterile except for the legislation to
increase the size of the Senate —an act
of sheer party expediency, anticipating
electoral defeat, and of highly doubtful
validity in its defiance of the Constitu-
tion’s provision that a Senator’s election
term shall be for six years, no more and
no less. That, however, is apparently a
pitfall which Ministers prefer to ignore.
Other Government business —approval
of the preliminary international trade
agreement and of the international wheat
agreement—effected nothing likely to be-
come operative in the world for some
time yet, if at all.
For the rest, this escapist and vindictive
Ministry merely dug its grave deeper.
The overwhelming and vehement “No”
to its referendum appeal in all States was
a shattering blow struck by an elector-
ate resentful of “Labor’s” petty tyrants
and their attempt to introduce socialisa-
tion by the back-door, and of a Ministry
not susceptible to the requirement that
every one of its members shall scrupu-
lously dissociate his administration from
the least breath of scandal and
strangely tolerant of the insolence ol
Communist union-bosses.
The concluding six months of the ses-
sion saw that same Ministry embarrassed
by
The Garden case, on the breaking of
which Mr. Ward should have been imme-
diately suspended from his Ministerial
offices.
The “Keane Trunks Case,” in which the
reputation of a Minister no longer living
has yet to be cleared.
The Blain case, in which decent amends
in Parliament are still refused to a soldier-
member whose personal honor and military
record were scurrilously traduced by
“Labor” members whose innocence of all
military service seems like a qualification
for preferment in the party.
Reactions from the indictment of the
Tasmanian “Labor” Premier on charges
from which the jury acquitted him, whereon
he picked himself up and resumed office
as though nothing had happened.
The false position in which Dr. Evatt’s
blundering in foreign affairs repeatedly
placed the Government—the quarrel with
America over Japan, with the Dutch over
Indonesia, and the boosting as a great ser-
vice for peace of the U.N.O. committee’s
partition of Palestine, indefensible for the
Australian share in it (we refused to send
the smallest policing force), and most of
all for the mortification it caused in Britain.
The 40-hour week came in, and its
effects promptly rebutted every Chifleyite
promise made for it by sending man-
hour production into a further slump and
hastening that very inflation of costs
which Mr. Chifley was pretending to ward
off. Dollar restrictions descended and ex-
posed for what they were worth the
Slitherings of Ministers about “the gear-
ing of our economy to meet depression.”
The Communist-led strikers’ blows to
throw first Victoria and then Queensland
into industrial chaos failed, though not
without much damage done to Common-
wealth trade and services, and redound-
ing chiefly to the disgrace of the Chifley
crowd, who sat inactive, apparently wait-
ing to see whether Australian democracy
or Communism would' gain the day in
each State.
And over all continuing coal strikes,
wharf strikes, shipping hold-ups, gas and
power stoppages in the great industrial
centres —all of Communist engineering or
sympathy; the defiance of the special
stevedoring and coal tribunals by the
unions which these things were to appease
and pamper; and the “dead set” by one
militant union after another against the
new substitutes for the Arbitration Court,
the new lay Conciliation Commissioners,
“streamlined,” air-flow fellows who were
going to prevent strikes even being
thought of, but who are being subjected
by the unions now to the same old buc-
caneer treatment that any Government
worth the name ought to stamp on with-
out hesitation.
The Chifley Government is not worth
the name.
Scenes in Two Cities.
In Sydney on Thursday and Friday a
parcel of scared N.S.W. “Labor” poli-
ticians discussed behind closed doors the
coal catastrophe which they in their
feebleness have brought on the country ;
and, with official instruments of their
“policy” to advise and their Miners’
Federation masters to dictate, they
sought the least invidious temporary
compromise. It was a dreadful exhibi-
tion of incompetence and indecision.
Armidale (N.S.W.) saw another sight
—a conference of local-government men,
called by the Armidale Council and the
Dumaresq Shire and attended by dele-
gates from eight districts, all determined
to free their people from the worst con-
sequences of over-centralisation and
“Labor”-Communist rule and to place
them in a position to shape their own
regional destinies by setting up a State
in what is now northern N. S. Wales. A
State with its own Assembly and Adminis-
tration and with its own representation
at Canberra, representation comparable
to that enjoyed by the 10 States admitted
to the American Union between 1889 and
1912.
A resolution to this effect was adopted,
and so were resolutions in favor of co-
operation “with other movements hav-
ing similar aims,” and of a revision of
the Constitution, to be sought by way of
“an elected citizens’ convention.” It
was decided also to appoint a provisional
executive and a secretariat “to organise
the north and north-west” ; the delegates
guaranteed the cost.
So the Northern New State and De-
centralisation Movement came into being.
Official “Labor,” of course, will oppose
it. Communists will do it all the harm
they can. Nevertheless, it will go for-
ward, and so will movements in other
parts of the Commonwealth —that Com-
monwealth which has been twisted from
the grand purposes of its founders by
weak and bad men, and in which coastal
cities accumulate population, illusive
wealth and power while the country
decays. The beginnings of these other
movements are visible already.
The Furred Menace.
Tales of rabbiters earning up to £6O a
week and a hinterland literally teeming
with their quarry, together with re-
ports of enormous increases in rabbitskin
exports (they were worth £9,900,000 last
year, compared with £600,000 in 1939),
have started the idea that the rabbit is an
economic asset and rabbiting a “good
game.” Nothing could be further from
the truth, as S. C. Burston, of Riverina,
and D. L, McMaster, of Liverpool Plains,
told a conference last week.
To yield that £9,000,000-worth of
skins last year about 50,000,000 rabbits
were killed. Nobody knows how
many more millions survived, but when
the warm weather comes and the skins
lose their value—and the trappers stop
work —the country will discover itself
paying a terrific price for tolerating, if
not encouraging, one of the worst pests
it has.
In good seasons like the present one
rabbits multiply furiously. Ten rabbits
will eat more grass than a sheep—a
hundred million rabbits displace 10
million sheep. If the summer be dry
the rabbits eat the grass, the grass-roots,
grass- and clover-seed and bark, kill
edible shrubs, make pastures, stock-routes
and crop-land barren, lay vast areas open
to wind erosion and generally wreak an
appalling amount of destruction. ‘ The
rabbit “industry” is a blight; no other
country depending on its land production
as we do would tolerate the things for
a moment.
As for rabbiting itself, the average
trapper’s camp is a place of smells and
squalor, the work is bloody, dirty and
callous, and children reared in such sur-
roundings, constantly moving from place
to place, don’t get a fair go. Young
men enticed into the game by the big
money offering may find themselves in-
dustrial misfits when skin prices collapse.
What Chifley Can Do.
Like jesting Pilate, Chifley asks of his
critics. What can I do? The Crimes
Act gives him (Section 30J) the answer:
. (1) If. at any time the Governor-General
is of opinion that there exists in Australia a
serious industrial disturbance prejudicing or
threatening trade or commerce with other
countries or among the Stales, he may make a
Proclamation to that effect, which Proclamation
shall be and remain in operation for the pur-
poses of this section until it is revoked.
(2) Any person who during the operation of
such Proclamation takes part in or continues
or incites to, urges, aids, or encourages the
taking-part in, or continuance of, a lockout or
strike—
(a) In relation to employment in, or in
connection with, the transport of goods or
the conveyance of passengers in trade or
commerce with other countries or among
the States; or
(b) In relation to employment in, or in
connection with, the provision of any public
service by the Commonwealth or by any
department or public authority under the
Commonwealth,
shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable
on conviction to imprisonment for any period
not exceeding one year, and in addition (if he
was not born in Australia) to deportation by
order of the Attorney-General as provided in
this Act.
(3) For the purposes of this section....
“Strike” includes the total or partial
cessation of work by employees, acting in
combination, if the cessation is unreason-
able, as a means of enforcing compliance
with demands made by them or by other
employees on employers, and the total or
partial refusal of employees, acting in com-
bination, to accept work, if the refusal is
unreasonable, and also includes job control.
This is one of the provisions which the
A.C.T.U. and the Communists have de-
clared must be expunged from the statute-
book as “repressive legislation.” The
“repressive legislation” also embraces
State laws of Victoria and Queensland
(Hanlon has obliged with repeal of the
anti-picketing law) and the Federal De-
fence Projects Act and the Crimes Act.

POLITICAL POINTS
“I have learned that conditions in the
New Guinea territory are most unsatis-
factory and white residents are dissatisfied
with the way in which affairs are being
conducted.” Ward said that in the House
on June 26, 1941. What a joker history
can be!
Melbourne is still reeling from the
shock of the Gee-Gee’s arrival at St.
Paul’s as a Friar of Orders Grey—no,
that’s a mistake ; as a Prior of St. John of
Jerusalem in a sweeping black gown, with
Maltese Cross, and a black Tudor hat.
Nothing was wanting from the spectacle
but a party of Sydney Turf Club worthies,
brewers (tied-houses for ever!) and
licensees with new transfers —and no
damned nonsense about local option—
giving tongue to their appreciation of the
only enactments for which the Gee-Gee
will be remembered.
Two prefabricated timber houses
ordered by Canberra in Finland are on
the water, and 10,000 more have been
offered, delivery within three years. In
what the Russkis have left of Finland
the population is little more than that of
N. S. Wales. Finns in the building trades
must be working.
Perhaps inspired by Chifley’s statement
that he had rung up four newspaper
managers to complain of things they had
printed. Senator “L’Amour” reminded
the “Government” that it could ban im-
ports of newsprint “and thus save
dollars.” Another way of saving dollars
would be to ban jaunts around the world,
interrupted or not interrupted by
cigarettes burnt or Coca-Cola swigged in
planes.
As Treasurer since October 7, 1941,
Chifley has snatched the record for the
longest continuous term from Earle Page.
A record which he already held, and
which will probably never be beaten, is
that of being the Treasurer most con-
sistently out —and Out to glory—in his
estimates of revenue and expenditure.
Yet he is always months late with his
Budgets.
Annoyed with Don Cameron, the
P.M.G., for his; “failure to issue a Forrest
centenary stamp” (Forrest was born at
Bunbury on August 22, 1847), the “West
Australian” suggests that “it might be a
good idea if Federal Ministers began now
to study the history of this side of the
continent,” and learned enough to give
appropriate names to the three new
Federal seats the West is—perhaps—to
get. The paper’s nominations are
Vlamingh, Stirling and Mitchell. But it
allows that “Mr. McKell’s advisers will
have the final say,” and under Mr. Mc-
Kell’s inspiration, and perhaps that of Mr.
Ashley, the “advisers” may prefer to dip
into the ragbag of racing history and fish
out Blue Spec, Eurythmic and Jolly
Beggar.
Text of a Chifley reply, published when
Parliament was in recess, to questions
asked by Archie Cameron, about Liaison-
officer Garden, to Chifley (June 3) “a
convicted criminal”:
Garden was not given special approval
for access to the records of any other de-
partment while in Labor and National
Service.
Officers of one department are not
allowed access to the records of another
in the ordinary course of business with-
out special approval.
Then how did Garden, when liaison-
officer to Holloway, come to have the
run of the External Territories office
(Ward’s) for four years? J. R. Donovan,
now a Conciliation Commissioner, has
sworn that, when he was Ward’s private
secretary, Garden was treated as “one
of the staff”—Ward’s.
Mystery follows mystery. From
Lang’s “Century”:
Customs is expected to provide the next
juicy political morsel when the House
meets again.
From the “Sunday Sun” (Sydney):
A prominent N.S.W. Federal member
intends shortly to holiday in Queensland —
just a front for less innocent activities.
He believes that he is on the verge of
uncovering a racket of a magnitude suf-
ficient to dwarf any political scandal of
the past decade. The remainder of the
evidence is in Queensland.
The “Sunday Sun” got in first with a
story of “a brown-paper parcel, posted
in Sydney to a person in Queensland,”
which, when opened at the Sydney Dead
Letter Office, yielded £7OOO in banknotes,
mostly, it seems, of the favored denomi-
nation, £lO, But the paper didn’t connect
this article with the par about the inquisi-
tive member.
Victoria’s Liberals are out with a
wheat-stabilisation plan to give the grower
a home-consumption price of 7s. a
bushel for three years and an export
price of ss. for 10 years. It’s to go to
the Australian Agricultural Council —and
Pollard, Pollard is sticking to the Inter-
national Agreement as long as he can. It
may not be long, for the thing is unlikely
to be ratified by the U.S. Congress before
the next Australian harvest, if ratified at
all, and Argentina and Russia are stand-
ing out.
Evans, the member for Mirani (N.Q.),
has been delving into the disbursement of
the Hanlons’ “State Development Tax”
and finds that, of about £20,000,000 col-
lected since its inception, about £4,000,000
went to consolidated revenue, £8,000,000
to Brisbane and £2,700,000 to the coun-
try, towns included. An argument for a
North Queensland State Evans says; and
so it is—one of many.
Forty-eight hours after the McGirr-
Chifley Coal Board announced that the
coal situation had “culminated in . a
crisis demanding drastic restrictions,”
and specified them, McGirr was at
Kogarah blithering for the “Labor”
nominee, a Mr. Oxford, in this strain:
We have heard the miner condemned,
but he is doing wonderful work. Last
year, under “Labor” administration, he '
produced 11,000,000 tons of coal in this
State. The best period of the Liberal Gov-
ernment was in 1939, when 9,000,000 tons
was produced.
“The N.S.W. Statistical Register for
1945-46, published by authority of the
Government,” details the 1939 output —
11,195,832 tons. This year the McGirr -
Chifley board set a target of 13,000,000
tons, and McGirr’s “very wonderful
miners” may give it 10,000,000. N. S.
Wales is resigned to the fact that McGirr
was born without a backbone, but he
should try not to be silly and to read
his own statistician’s reports —if he can,
Melbourne “Argus,” urging the Holl-
way Government to go baldheaded for
brown coal:
The battle against the coal problem is
literally a fight for survival.
McGirr and Chifley see it as a shuffle
for survival —survival of place and pay.
They never fight.
The Brisbane Port Committee, an off-
shoot of the Stevedoring Industry Com-
mission, agreed to a stop-work meeting
of wharflaborers to “discuss union busi-
ness.” The meeting was abandoned
for a football match, with booze and
betting laid on, so the Port Committee
has “approved” of another, to be held
today: 8 a.m, to 11 a.m.; “work” to
be resumed at 1 p.m. Shipowners are to
protest to the 5.1. C., but that body will
no doubt be reminded by Healy, its Com-
munist member (at £3 a day), that it was
set up to “give the workers everything
they ask for,”
Adelaide’s branch of the Australian
Society of Engineers and Pope Products
have signed an agreement excluding Com-
munists from employment and from hav-
ing anything to do with A.S.E. dealings
with the firm, and providing for a secret
ballot before strikes. If this sort of
thing spreads Cofnmunisrh in these parts
will become one with Chifleyism.
N.S.W. “Labor’s” Abie Landa, M.L.A.,
that doughty Second Fronter (by deputy)
of other days, is at it again. At a Zionist
“rally” in Sydney following Bishop Pil-
cher, who seems more Zionist than Zion-
ists themselves, Abie was all enthusiasm,
indignation and pugnacity—last-ditch,
though remote:
We should not be expected to give up
one inch of the Jewish State not one
eighth of what we could justly claim.
I am ashamed of my “Labor” colleagues
in England Bevin, the most colossal
failure.
We must stand unashamed, be strong and
resolute and give every possible assistance
to the heroic defenders of our homeland.
“Our homeland”? That’s rich. Isn’t
Abie, in less emotional moments, an
A ustralian ? As for “the heroic defen-
ders,” one set (alas!) is fighting another
set and a third set is expected to join in.
Earle Page to the New-State Conven-
tion at Armidale (N.S.W.):
Before the separation of Queens-
land from New South Wales my
uncle, though a stripling, carried around
the 1856 petition to include in the new
northern State Armidale and the country
down to the 32nd parallel. After that
separation my grandfather, in 1861, was
the repository of the petition for self-
government for the remainder of the north
left out of Queensland. Another uncle
was leader of the agitations of the ’7o’s,
’Bo’s and ’9o’s to secure autonomy.. I myself
have been publicly fighting the issue since
1915. This makes almost a century of
elfort for our political freedom through
self-government and our economic freedom
through full provision of modern inventions
and amenities for the outback people.
A worthy record, unique in Australia, and
delegates were ready with the recogni-
tion it deserved.
“Labor’s” historic objection to titles
and other name-handles is going the
way of all the other “ ‘Labor’ prin-
ciples.” In 1943 Curtin recommended a
K.C.M.G. for Shedden, the Secretary of
Defence. In the late Birthday knighthood
list there figured Rolph, of the Laun-
ceston “Examiner,” at the instance of the
Tas. “Labor” Government —he already
has the C.M.G. and the 0.8. E. In Wes-
tralia Panton', sometime “Labor” Speaker
and Minister, was named C.8.E., and
Wilson, for 38 years “Labor” M.L.A. for
coaly Collie, accepted an 0.8. E. An-
other C.B.E. went to Westralia’s Tommy
Bath, a “Labor” member of two Minis-
tries, who could have become Premier,
He stood down for Jack Scaddan.
Darwin was amused or mystified
according to the reader’s taste by two
advertisements in the same issue of the
“Northern Standard.” One, inserted by
the Disposals Commission, called for
tenders for purchase of piping and build-
ings at Berry Springs, The other was to
the effect that one P. A. Rawlings had
“bought all Berry Springs piping and
buildings from ‘Disposals’ on October
28, 1946” ; that any person submitting a
tender would do so at his own risk, and
that a larceny charge would be laid
against anyone removing any of the build-
ings or pipes.
Socialism continues, to do-in the
people’s money. Three British Govern-
ment airlines showed losses running into
£9,750,000 sterling to March 31, 1948-,
despite heavy increases in revenue from
passengers carried. And the “national-
ised” railways are reckoned to have lost
£25,000,000.
A Brisbane “Courier-Mail” reporter,
casting his eye over the winter holiday-
makers at Southport and Surfers’ Para-
dise, found both places crowded out and
“streamlined cars everywhere”—they
“line the pavement, and number-plates
indicate the long distances they have
travelled.” Presumably their petrol
licences showed “business and pleasure.”
Young Mr. Godfrey Blunden is now
debunking the U.S.S.R. for “S. M.
Herald.” He pronounced it a land of
supermen till he went there. One of his
prescriptions for this country, published
in the “Herald’s” junior contemporary,
was that it should “offer Russia sufficient
airmen and crews to maintain 500 Ameri-
can bombers anci fighters at Vladivos-
tock.” Could the crazy notion have been
acted upon the 500 would have been in-
terned and few would have come back.
The new manager of Lennon’s Hotel,
Brisbane, was private secretary to Attlee.
His report on his former chief: “Very
quiet and reserved and he blushed easily.”
Then the P.M. must blush as often as he
contemplates the effects of his policy in
Egypt, Palestine, India, Burma, Malaya
and Hong Kong, from which he has with-
drawn the British squadron in about the
last retreat possible to him.
Twenty-seven S.A. furniture-makers
have agreed to stamp their products as
a guarantee of quality. It is an idea that
should be extended to the footwear trade,
and others. Quality is one of the casual-
ties of this “Labor” age, and the chief
victim is the plagued and unprotected
housewife.
The P.M., three months ago, to the
A.L.P. Macquarie Assembly (his own
electorate) of the A.L.P.:
If Australia’s industrial production is not
greatly increased we can anticipate
economic disaster. Our industrial honey-
moon has been very pleasant, but like all
honeymoons it will come to an end some-
time.
If the “disaster” comes there will be
no doubt who are the guilty parties.
“When coal is shut off, coke is shut off;
and when coke is shut off, blast-furnaces
can’t operate; and that shuts off pig-
iron, which closes down steel-mills and
keeps rolling-mills idle, which means that
there will be no steel for hundreds of
items made from steel.” An extract from
an American paper, but on every point
pertinent to Australia. The material dif-
ference is the U.S. Government can, and
does, end coal strikes by recourse to
Federal Court injunctions, followed by
proceedings involving terrific fines such as
have been imposed on the union and its
Lewis. Lewis, though not a Communist,
is a Welshman, like the leader of our
Miners’ Federation, Williams. Williams
is a Communist, and our Government
wouldn’t dare to do a thing to him or
his mob.
Dr. Evatt on his plan for Palestine, “in-
appropriately labelled partition”:
I was chairman, of the committee In
my opinion the United Nations decision
has been gradually undermined by intrigues
directed against the Jewish people.
“My opinion” is not shared by Old
Digger Archie Michaelis, M.L.A., or by
the “Australian Jewish Outlook,” pub-
lished by Peter Isaacson, and written in,
part by other good Australians of the
Jewish faith with fine war records. The
“Outlook” sees “the Jewish people of
Palestine brought to disaster by unwise
leaders, and calls upon “reasonable
Jewish leaders in all parts of the
world” and “Jewish communities every-
where” to “withdraw all moral and
financial support from militant Zionism,”
provided the Arabs are “equally ready to
negotiate.” It took real intellectual
honesty and courage to publish that.
Convention note, .with a moral:
Dewey is again to be Republican candidate
for President, this time with the Californian
Warren as his running-mate. Second to the
New Yorker in the ballots at Philadelphia, a
long away ahead of Stassen, Vandenberg,
Warren and MacArthur, was Senator Taft,
whom the union hierarchy was going to run
out of public life for drafting and steering
through Congress the measure which has put
the fear of God in the hearts of Communist
and other union bullies and Federal Govern-
ment employees minded to strike. Mobilising
the unions to defeat the Republicans was part
of the plan. It has been dropped cold. The
moral is that courage in the good cause of pro-
tecting individual unionists against wicked strikes
and their consequences is respected by working-
men everywhere. Opposition politicians in these
parts should make a note of it. “Labor”
politicians, Hanlon excepted, and a few others,
such as Keon and Cremean in Victoria, are
hopeless.

Thomas E. Dewey, by winning the Re-
publican nomination, becomes odds-on
favorite for United States President. If
he gets the job he will have broken a
couple of records besides ending a 16-
year Democratic run. He is the first de-
feated Presidential candidate ever to win
the Republican nomination —that he was
able to surmount this hoodoo is proof of
his party’s' confidence that the Presidency
is already in their grip—and, at 46, he
will be the youngest man ever elected to
the White House; Theodore Roosevelt,
though younger when he became Presi-
dent, was not actually elected to the post
but stepped up from Vice-President when
McKinley was assassinated. Dewey has
been Governor of New York since 1942,
and isi best known in connection with a
campaign against racketeers in the nine-
teen-thirties, first as special prosecutor
in the investigation of organised crime
and then as New York District Attorney.
His supporters acclaim him as the man
who busted the rackets; hisi opponents
say that he didn’t bust them at all, or,
alternatively, that someone else busted
them for him, or that there weren’t any
rackets to bust, or that they are still un-
busted.
Nationwide sympathy will go out
to Immigration Minister Calwell and
his wife in the loss of their only son. The
lad had been suffering from a rare blood
disease for the past four months, and
in an effort to save him a new drug was
flown from America. Unfortunately the
attempt failed ,and young Arthur died
last week. He was 11 years old.
Officer Commanding, Flinders Naval
Depot, has always had heavy responsi-
bility. Ships at sea have no time to teach
theory of aim-off to hit a suicide bomber
or how to place a broadside on a speed-
ing target across 14 miles of tumbling
sea; when gunners join they are ex-
pected to be gunners. The same applies
to signals, engineering, cookery, radar
and all the multifarious duties which go
to make a warship a self-contained fight-
ing unit. Flinders does the job. New
C. is Commodore W. A. Dallmeyer,
D. R.N., recently captain of the
Minesweeping Training School on the
Firth of Forth, which trained the men
only now finishing the greatest mine-
clearance job in history. Dallmeyer
knows Rear-Admiral Farncomb —they
shipped together as snotties in old battler
Royal Sovereign 30 years ago. In her
he saw the German Fleet scuttled at
Scapa Flow. Followed service in the
coastguards, Warspite and cruiser Con-
cord, which, in 1925, came to Australia
on exchange duties with H.M.A.S. Bris-
bane. Then a lieutenant, Dallmeyer
stayed in England to specialise in tor-
pedoes, and was appointed Squadron
Torpedo Officer of the N.Z. Squadron.
Followed his half-stripe and appointment
as torpedo officer of cruiser Exeter, of
River Plate and Java Sea fame. Re-
turning to capital ships, he was at Alex-
andria in Renown when Australia was
winning her Med. Fleet regattas, and was
again in the Med. commanding destroyer
Highlander on convoy work, sinking a
U-boat and winning his D.S.O. The
Pacific saw him commanding carrier
Venerable, and though too late for the
war, experience gained then will be in-
valuable in training replacements for our
own two Fleet carriers,
“Mick O’Melbourne”; Bob Menzies
and family must have struck rather a
rough passage across the Bight according
to a radiogram received by their relatives.
The message concluded with the follow-
ing words, “Exodus 10 Verse 23,” which
reads:—

Australian Trade Commissioner in
N.Z., Major-General J. J. Murray, D.S.O.
and bar, M.C., was a grocer’s assistant
at Anthony Hordern’s when recruiting
for World War I started; he left Aus-
tralia as a sergeant and came back a
major. Hordern’s promoted him to
transport manager, but he left to join an
oil concern as transport director, and a
few years later was managing-director
of Associated Transport Services. When
World War II began he transferred from
the militia, in which he had served be-
tween stoushes, to become colonel and
C.O. at Ingleburn camp, where he organ-
ised the “March to Bathurst.” In Tobruk
with the Ninth Divvy, he returned home
as a Brigadier and was promoted to Major-
General to take over command of
Northern Queensland. Born in Sydney’s
historic quarter “The Rocks,” where his
father for generations was host of the
Australian Hotel, Murray has a sense
of humor which should help him in the
Maoriland job as it did in all his others.
A pipe as famous in certain Melbourne
circles as the Churchill cigar on the
world stage retired last week from
the Victorian Police Force, For 31 years'
it had been continuously in the mouth
of Sergeant M. J, Murphy, of the Wire-
less Patrol, known as “the man with the
pipe,” and alternatively as the “two-up
school terror.” As a moral symbol it
hadn’t the aggressive look of Churchill’s
cigar, but Sergeant Murphy had admirers
even amongst the sports he harried from
one vacant allotment to another.
Still another gong to Australia’s
air hero of two world wars, Air-
Commodore A. H. Cobby, C.8.E.,
D. 5.0., D.F.C. and two bars, G.M-
This time he gets the U.S. Medal
of Freedom with Bronze Palm for
“directing his planes in continuous
action against the enemy installa-
tions in the Celebes and Halmahera
Islands.” Although once again in Civvy-
street —he is N.S.W. Regional director of
Civil Aviation —Cobby is still active in
Air Force circles. As president of the
Victorian Division of the Air Force
Association, he was well to the fore in
organising the recent Air Force Week, A
genial host, he entertains many British
airmen on visits to this country.
An artist and the son of an artist,
Louis McCubbin, holder of the palette
and brushes depicted below by Coventry,
has been director of Adelaide’s National
Gallery since 1936. Born in Melbourne
in 1890, he learnt his craft at the Mel-
bourne Gallery School, won the A.N.A.
Landscape Prize in 1914 and shortly
afterwards left Australia for the First
World War with the 10th Field Ambu-
lance, later becoming an official war
artist. In 1920 the Commonwealth Gov-
ernment commissioned him to paint battle
pictures and murals for the Australian
War Memorial; it was a nine-year job,
and not long after it was completed the
Australian National Travel Association
sent him up to the Barrier Reef to paint
a series of pictures. McCubbin is
represented in several Australian gal-

Benno Moiseiwitsch, caught by Dubois
in his suite at Sydney’s Australia, con-
stitutes as safe a bet as any impresario
could make. With five tours of Australia
behind him, he kicked off his latest season
under the Tail banner with seven packed
Sydney concerts —natural enough, for his
art, mellowed by 40 years on the concert
platform, is about as high as any virtuoso
can attain. Bom in Odessa in 1880, he
won the Rubenstein Prize at the Imperial
School of Music at nine years of age. He

spent the years 1905-08 under Lesche-
titzky in Vienna, in the final year making
his London debut. Since then he has
made London the headquarters from
which he has embarked on countless
world conquests. In 1937 he became a
naturalised British subject. Like all the
top-rankers he has a great memory—up
to 40 full-length works as well as hun-
dreds of short pieces he may call upon
in a season. For diversion he loves
poker. Next to his golf, which he
gloomily admits gets worse, his favorite
sport is practising on the keyboard. The
intense silence in which Australian audi-
ences listen to his playing he greatly ap-
preciates—he observes that applause can
be “manufactured,” but not silence. In-
cluded in the 1000-odd recitals he gave
up and down blitzed Britain were many
for war charities and for troops; and a
C.B.E. recognises his service. At one con-
cert for the Royal Marines at Portsmouth
his programme included the 24 Preludes of
Chopin, played, of course, straight
through. As he rose to acknowledge the
applause at the end a marine at the
back got up and looked at his watch.
“Blime!” he said. “That one took 35
minutes —it’ll be tomorrow morning be-
fore he’s finished the other 23!” Then
he vanished.
“H.W.M.”; Fred Strangward, of Mel-
bourne, the exquisite hobbyist who
fashioned wonderful mosaics out of
matchsticks, died at 81, practically blinded
after years of close application to his in-
tricate work. People from all over the
world visited his home to inspect his
artistic creations, which should have found
a permanent resting-place in one of our
national museums. One piece, a lady’s
writing-table, contained hundreds of thou-
sands of pieces of orangewood, black-
wood, jarrah, holly and myrtle, the orange-
wood growing from a seed he planted as a
boy. His work has been depicted in illus-
trated magazines all over the world, and
was ranked by experts as outstanding. He
valued his collection at £25,000 ; disposed
of at auction in his own home town after
his death it brought £561.
“Cob”: More youngsters brought to an
early grave by the tropic north. Recently
dead at Woodstock, near Townsville, 90-
year-old Albert Linton Smith, an Ararat
(Vic.) native, who had been farming in
the district for nearly half a century and
was among the earliest exhibitors to the
Townsville Pastoral and Agricultural
Shows; and Mrs. Martha Field, whose
fall and a fractured leg a month earlier
hastened her end at 87. Mrs. Field, who
refused to have the ambulance summoned
until the day after the accident, settled
with her husband and two children on
their Woodstock farm and cattle property
46 years ago. Mrs. Jane Carpenter, who
lived for 40 of the 75 years she spent in
Australia at Charters Towers, was 97
when the call came, at Townsville, early
this month,
“H.H.”: Dead at Toorak (Vic.), at 84,
Walter Bayles, the last of a generation
of pastoral pioneers. He was reared at
Coomete station, Western District, which
was bought in 1865 by his father a
former Victorian Minister, Lord Mayor
of Melbourne, Tasmanian pastoralist and
merchant—and which Walter owned till
his death. In 1888 he and his two
brothers rode out 300 miles west of
Charters Towers and bought for
£30,000 half a million acres of unfenced
downs near Julia Creek which they named
Toorak. They were game. Artesian-
bores were then unheard of, and one time
every hoof and man was camped on a
dam with only a day’s water left when
a thunderstorm relieved the situation.
After that Walter, as manager, put down
the first bore in N.Q. there, but, following
the droughts culminating in 1902, he came
to Melbourne to raise £lO,OOO or walk
off. “What security?” asked the g.m,
of the wool firm. “None,” replied
Walter; but he got the overdraft, and
later turned down £280,000 for Toorak,

action, presented to the R.A.N. this month
by Rear-Admiral Salm, on behalf of the
Royal Netherlands Navy, emphasises the
tradition of father-son service which our
Navy, though comparatively young, has
already established. J, C. Waller and
D. J. Martin, sons of Perth’s last captain
and executive officer, are in the R.A.N.
College now. Captain Burnett, in com-
mand of Sydney when she sank and was
sunk by raider Kormoran, has two boys
serving. Commodore J, M. Armstrong,
until recently Second Naval Member, had
a son afloat during the war, and a son
of Commander G.G.O. Gatacre, com-
mander of Flinders Naval Depot, will
sit for his college entrance exam, this
year.
Dead in Sydney, Harold Edward
Townsend. An original of the 3rd Field
Engineers, he landed as a sapper at
Anzac, won his commission and was in
charge of the party that destroyed guns
and dumps at the evacuation. After
Gallip, he transferred to the Ist Pioneers,
commanded a company in France, was
twice mentioned- in dispatches and won
an M.C. Townsend was a fine boxer, and
after the armistice he won the middle-
weight championship of the Second
British Army. Rejoining the colors in
the second war, he was sent to Darwin,
where his health failed him, A prince of
good fellows, Townsend before the first
war was a mine manager and engineer at
Broken Hill; at the time of his death he
was working with a survey group of the
N.S.W. Lands Department.
Into the Silence:
At Wamberal (N.S.W.), at 58? Eric Napier
Birks, soldier, orchardist, writer and sportsman.
A son of Fred Birks, who predeceased him
by only a few months, he accompanied his
father to the New Australia colony in Paraguay
as a child. Badly wounded in the First World
War, he had lost count of his operations, but
his spirits never flagged. His interests were
diverse; at different times he worked in his
father’s wholesale drug business, ran the Hal-
stead Press, grew fruit, raised pigs and wrote
for various papers, including The Bulletin.
At Manly (N-S.W.), at 92, John Joseph
Harnett. Born at Eucumbene, near Adaminaby,
he was known from Kiandra to the Victorian
border as a good sheepman and a fine judge
of cattle.
In Melbourne, at 80, Merson S. Cooper, well-
known in racing circles and one of the oldest
veterans of the Stock Exchange of Melbourne.
A member of most metropolitan clubs, he raced
San Antonio, Powerscourt, Prince Viol and
other good horses. The V.A.T.C. perpetuated
his interest in racing in the Merson Cooper
Stakes,
In Brisbane, at 73, James Hornibrook,
pastoralist and chairman of directors of Cabool-
ture Co-op. Dairy Association, Bom in County
Cork, Ireland, he came to Queensland in 1898
and settled in the Nambour district.
In Brisbane, at 54, T. McLaughlin, barrister.
Admitted as a solicitor in 19?0, he practised
for some years in towns on both sides of the
Queensland-New South Wales border. He was
called to the Bar in 1931, and had since gained
a fine reputation as an advocate. During the
war he served with a Red Cross search unit in
New Guinea.

"AND IT'S PRINTED
WITH WIMBLES INKS"

“Hallmark”: Forestalling criticism?
A sign displayed at the entrance to an
Adelaide brewery where building exten-
sions are in progress: “These materials
are not essential for housing. The
cement has been imported from England
and the permit number is .”
* * * *
“Lord Luvus”: An example of bureau-
cratic red-tape which will probably be-
come a classic to be quoted centuries
hence when bureaucrats will be precisely
the same as they are now has recently
occurred in London. The Civil Aviation
Ministry issued a seven-page screed of
2000 words inviting tenders for the
supply of screws, and an accompanying
schedule directed the allocation of con-
signments, 25 p.c. to one depot and 75
p.c. to another. The schedule also
warned consignors against offering bribes
to secure the contract and forbade them
to allow any member of Parliament
to receive any benefit from the
order. The contract became null and
void if the contractor went bankrupt. The
order was for eight dozen round-head
three-sixteenth-inch screws to the total
value of tenpence. “A ridiculous error
due to the inexperience of junior clerical
staff,” was Jthe departmental head’s ex-
planation.
* * * *
“Kelms”: A Perth reporter with a
crime-don’t-pay slant has warned his
public of the dangers of gold-stealing.
Stressing the need for experience, he in-
stances the case of a “newchum” who
took a job underground and “sweated
and shivered” to obtain a tinful of iron
pyrites under the impression that it
was gold. Then there was the chap who
applied some gold paint—with a brush —
to 10001 b. of worthless ore and sold the
lot “for a substantial sum, to an un-
suspecting illicit gold-buyer.” This chap,
although the article doesn’t say so, later
came to Perth and made a fortune paint-
ing lamb-chops on restaurant plates. I’ve
never met an illicit gold-buyer, as such,
but an acquaintance once indicated two
men who, he said, were well up in the
game. This acquaintance was as sharp as
a tack and about half as scrupulous, and
the respect in which he held the two
well-dressed thugs influenced my decision
never to attempt to take a rise out of
them. But perhaps the breed ain’t
what it used to be.
* * * *
“Laetitia”: Rarely seen nowadays are
the male armbands and the all-black
feminine ensemble which were the in-
signia of mourning a decade or so ago. I
can’t resist the impression that present-
day fashion runs to more ostentatious
funerals and thereafter a quick forget-
fulness, Noticeable also are the cheerful
aspect and well-tailored appearance of
the undertakers—pardon, “morticians”
—in contrast with the lugubrious counten-
ances and floppy frock-coats of those who
formerly performed the same roles. The
extent to which the Americans have
streamlined their funerals is evidenced in
an advertisement reproduced in a recent
issue Of “Time.” Herein the mortician’s
sales psychology runs to a life-size
portrait of a Varga girl, extolling the
appeal of “a body beautiful.”
“Ray Whiting”: Big Gordon, of the
Ninth Division Sappers, roaming around
Alexandria with a couple of mates,
spotted a beautiful new staff-car unat-
tended. “This’ll do us,” said Gordon, and
they all hopped in, but although they
almost ran the battery flat the engine
refused to fire. They tried shoving her,
but it was heavy work. Then round the
corner came a couple of provosts. “What
are you blokes up to?” asked one. “Can’t
get a spark out of her,” explained the
big bloke, “and the boss goes mad if I’m
late —gotter pick him up in the Square.”
Said the provost, “Get in and we’ll all
shove.” With an expression like a worried
babe Gordon climbed aboard and the
M.Ps. and the other two tore into the
shoving until the engine burst forth with
wild revs. In a flash the two sappers
flung open doors and mounted while
Gordon had her screaming down the
street, with a pair of speechless, purple-
faced provosts growing dimmer every
second.
* * * *
“S.S.”: Some street photographers don’t
show much imagination in the site
they choose for the scene of their acti-
vities. Saw a photo, the other day of two
frail, rather aristocratic-looking old
ladies. In the background was a large
advertisement reading: “So and So’s
beer is refreshing, invigorating, builds
your body. Drink it every day.”
* * * *
“Bybren”: It’s on again! In those
hives of industry where sick-leave is not
cumulative there is a sudden burst of
absenteeism with the end of the financial
year approaching. Though most em-
“There, my pet! Now you shan't catch a nasty chill."
ployers are resigned to the phenomenon,
some still cast a jaundiced eye on all cases
of sickness during June. Their scepticism,
though justifiable in many cases, does a
grave injustice to those who, like my
fellow-traveller on the 8.15, are genuinely
sick. Muffled to the eyebrows, he peered
at me through watery eyes and sniffed his
misery. I sympathised: “What, no sick-
leave left?” “Yes,” he wheezed, “but
who wants to stay home and feel crook
all day?”
* * ♦ *
“Ike Hollar”: It is quite understand-
able that any person in a moment of
mental fogginess can turn “his writing is
illegible” into “his writing is ineligible” ;
the reason for other slips is harder to
ratiocinate. The other day a friend told
me that his son had taken part in a school
play. “How did the young man comport
himself?” I asked jestingly. The proud
dad was enthusiastic. “He not only com-
ported himself; he comported everybody
else in the show,” he said. I am still
wondering what he thought I meant
by “comport.”
« * * *
“Jemac”: Entertainment not pro-
grammed was provided at a Sydney film-
house when a large gentleman was shown
his seat just after lights-out. Audience
settled, or squirmed, to listen to the vocal
record of a crooner’s rise to fame. Came
the usherette. “I’m sorry, sir, you’re in
the wrong seat.” “What d’yer know?”
said the large one. “And I’m stayin’
here.” Came the manager, polite at first,
and ending with; “I’ll fetch a police-
man!” “Fetch the police force,” advised
Lumpy. Came the police. “Now, what’s
all this?” “I was put here, and here I
stay.” Police wasted no time. “Are you
coming quietly, or d’you want to make a
blue?” Lumpy intimated he’d “make a
blue” all right, at which the law tried to
drag his 15-stone past a dozen vocal
women. Weight won, and the captive
sank back victorious. Law threatened,
management argued, audience muttered
and the wrong-seated sat adamant. Con-
certed public opinion shifted him at last.
“Shut up, sit down or git out!” Com-
batants departed simmering to the
managerial office, and the crooner drooled
on: “It’s easier to lerv than to hate.”
* * *, *
“Dong”: When a young lady was born
with a caul in a Sydney hospital recently,
papers described the event as “extremely
rare.” They may be right, but in Roman
days “to be born with a caul” was com-
mon enough to be made the equivalent
charm of the modem “silver spoon in
one’s mouth,” a generality which seems
to make it a little presumptive for sea-
faring men to have cornered this particu-
lar good-luck market. David Copper-
field entered the world with this accepted
drowning insurance, to find the supersti-
tion already shaking:
“ I was bom with a caul, which was
advertised for sale in the newspapers at
the low price of fifteen guineas. Whether
sea-going people were short of money about
that time, or were short of faith and
preferred cork-jackets, I don’t know; all I
know is that there was but one solitary
bidding and that from an attorney con-
nected with a b'ill-broking business, who
offered two pounds in cash and the balance
in sherry.”
* ♦ * *
“D.E.W.”: Mention of a baby born
in a Sydney hospital with a caul over its
head reminded me of an incident I wit-
nessed years ago in Bridge-street, Sydney.
A man .who had fallen from a tall build-
ing was hurtling towards the ground. His
death seemed certain, but he crashed into
the telephone wires whose hundreds of
strands in those days disfigured Sydney
streets. He catapulted back, but held on.
Then he walked along the wires to the
nearest pole and slid down. He was shak-
ing a bit when he reached the footpath,
but he grinned a little and said “I always
was lucky. I was born with one of them
cauls over my head.”
* * * *
“Findy”; What is news? Just as I
went to switch off the radio the other
night the announcer’s voice broke in on
the music with “We interrupt this pro-
gramme to bring to you an important
news-flash just received.” I withdrew
my hand from the switch and waited ex-
pectantly. My wife, who was crossing
the room, stopped short and listened, and
I suppose in thousands of homes all over
New South Wales listeners looked up
from cards or books wondering what
world-shattering message was about to
come over the ether. We were not kept
in suspense for long. The fateful words
came forth loud and clear: “The Minis-
ter for Local Government, Mr. Cahill,
has just announced that he will make no
statement on the coal situation until to-
morrow morning.”
* * s * *
“Flathead”: My excuse for falling
asleep and emitting a muted snore
through the latter part of “And Now,
What of Tibet?” is that I do not think
any man alive, given the same conditions
of that lecture, and the convenient pillar
that was there to hide behind, could pos-
sibly have stayed awake. My wife re-
stored me to the conscious world with a
smart poke in the ribs, causing a startled
snort which brought sniggers from all
around me. As I sat there, shamed, I re-
called the theory of a psychologist which
covers the situation fairly well. “Men
who fall asleep in lectures,” he said, “are
victims of an inner conflict. They are
mentally upset because they have a
psychological urge to stay away from the
situation in which they find themselves.
I explained this to the wife while the
speaker was changing his oil, and was
told that, while it might apply in some
cases, in mine the cause was far Jess tech-
nical, being “just plain laziness.”
«*■ * *
“John Charles”: Current discussions
of price-control reminded me of an ex-
ample of the power of Goebbels as a
mob-orator displayed in a speech when
the Nazi party was still striving for recog-
nition. He was speaking to a meeting
of potential supporters in a country dis-
trict when the question of prices came
up. He met the challenge with perfect
equanimity. “We don’t want increased
prices,” he said, “because that will affect
the consumer. We don’t want decreased
prices, because that will affect the pro-
ducer. What we do want,” he shouted
triumphantly, “is National Socialist
prices,” The statement brought resound-
ing cheers.
* * * *
“Muskeen”; Little Collins-street, Mel-
bourne, is about half the width of Pitt-
street, Sydney (B. 16/6/’4B), and if any-
one wants to make some easy money, let
him announce that he can completely
turn his straight-eight in Little Collins
without backing or encroaching on the
pavements. When the mob is in and the
cash in the hands of a reliable stake-
holder, he should take them to the west
end of the street, between Spencer- and
King-streets, where it is the width of any
major Melbourne street. Nine out of
10 of Melbourne’s citizenry are not aware
of this fact.
* * * *
“Bybren”: “Clooter” may be correct
in saying (B. 9/6/’4B) that radios are
banned from Adelaide race meetings, but
has he ever seen the ban enforced? Sets
are so numerous it would seem that they
are officially sanctioned. It is nothing
to see five or six sets within a few yards
of each other—each with its 50 or 60
intent faces and inclined heads. More
than once I have followed running, pant-
ing figures out into the open spaces be-
yond the betting-ring in the joyful
expectation of seeing a stoush, and en-
countered nothing more antagonistic than
a “portable” and its attendant patrons.
The practice annoys no one; and the
presence of receivers at football matches
is just as harmless. It’s preferable, in
fact, to the stentorian voice of the one-
eyed fan who bellows at the top of his
voice in the mistaken belief that he is
the controlling factor in his team’s
destiny.
* * * *
“Yowl”: When publican Herb Thomp-
son recently transported by boat to
Annie River and truck, 40 miles, to Coen
half a dozen kegs of Cairns draught-
beer, the old goldfield, Coen, recorded
its second draught-beer landing in 60
years. Except for that sampled on long-
spaced visits to larger centres, many of
those born in this far-off Peninsula settle-
ment hadn’t tasted draught-beer. How-
ever, the Cairns ■ brewery, since the suc-
cess of a trial flight of beer to Croydon,
is considering flying draught supplies to
far outback towns, and Coen, which is
on the air route from Cairns to Thursday
Island, is hoping a keg or two will be
dropped its way now and again,
* * * #
“L.H.P.” on predecessors of the
Oliviers:
“Richard III” and “The School for Scandal”
come to the present generation in Sydney as
almost novelties. Allan Wilkie played “Richard
III” at the Adelphi Theatre, now the Tivoli,
in May, 1916, and “The School for Scandal”
was last staged at the same theatre by Wilkie
in 1930.
Sydney has seen some fine exponents of
Crookback since 1880, among them Fairclough,
Bandmann, Dewhurst, Wm. E. Sheridan, Burdett
Howe, Geo. G. Miln and Alfred Dampier;
the last always discarded the Colley Cibber
version and followed Irving in presenting the
pure Bard. Of actors previous to 1880 I can-
not speak, but old hands gave the palm to
Barry Sullivan; Richard was his pet part. I
have kindly recollections of Rignold and
Alison’s revival of “The School for Scandal”
at the old Opera House in King-street, where
the Grace Building now stands. There Marie
De Grey (Lady Teazle), Morton Selten (Charles
Surface) and A. T. Hilton (Sir Peter Teazle)
figured to advantage.
The Brough-Boucicault revival at the Criterion
in 1888 had Mrs. Brough as a charming Lady
Teazle, Titheradge as Charles, Cecil Ward as
Joseph, James Cathcart as Sir Peter, Dion
Boucicault, jnr., as Backbite, and A. R-
Lawrence, the Joseph of De Grey’s show in
1884, as Crabtree. This was a most delightful
production. Mrs. Bernard Beere, after the
Theatre Royal fire on June 18, 1892, transferred
to the Criterion on June 18, and opened in
Sheridan’s masterpiece with herself as Lady
Teazle, Herbert Standing (Charles), Otho Stuart
(Joseph) and the evergreen Cathcart as Sir Peter.
The 1896 revival at the Lyceum by the Kyrle
Bellew-Potter co. had Bellew as a dashing
Charles, the ill-fated Scot Inglis as Joseph and
Cathcart in his favorite role of Sir Peter, but
Mrs. Brown Potter was a weak Lady T. The
tragic Nance O’Neil was out of her element
as Sheridan’s heroine in the May, 1900, re-
vival at Her Majesty’s, but Tom Kingston
(Charles), Harry Plimmer (Joseph) and the
American actor, Geo. Becks, as Sir Peter were
good. Then came the Hugh Buckler-Violet
Paget revival at the Little Theatre (the old
Standard) in Castlereagh-street in 1914 and
Allan Wilkie shows at the Grand Opera House
(now Tivoli) in 1917 and the Theatre Royal
in 1919, and again at the Opera House in 1930*
THE DEPRECATORS.
“Dr. Evatt said that the refusal of the Waterside
Workers’ Federation to load certain cargoes could not
be fairly described as a dictation of the Govern-
ment’s foreign policy, although admittedly it was
to some extent an obstruction of it. Such action had
always been deprecated by the Government.”
They didn’t tell Ben Chifley what should be
Our Canberra rulers’ foreign policy,
Or give him orders as if they, not ho'
Really conducted it.
Still, knowing what it was and all it meant
To ordinary minds, the way they went
Was pretty much of an equivalent—
They just obstructed it.
Dictation? Not a bit, Bert Evatt says,
Too sinister a term, too harsh a phrase,
As on the facts he bends his eagle gaze,
Therein discerning
Abundant evidence for all, he feels.
Save rabid partisans and imbeciles,
The wharfies did no more than sprag the wheels
To stop them turning.
And even this, mayhap as a defence
Of Governments that make a poor pretence
Of ruling, in a burst of confidence
Observe he states it,
Outspokenly admits and frankly owns
And, though a bit belatedly, depones
That while such lawless action he condones
He deprecates it.
“To deprecate” implies, you may infer
(Or so at least my diction’ries aver),
“To pray that anything may not occur,”
Brisk supplicating,
Shrill orisons ’gainst what you’d fain avert,
And hence the fixed idea, one may assert,
In the bright lexicons of Ben and Bert
That what they daren’t denounce they’ll do no
hurt
By deprecating.
N.S.W.
T. THE R.


“T.F.”: “Harold Hardupp’s” lamp-
lighter who ran the risk of a bashing
from larrikins (B. 9/6/’4B) would find a
sympathiser in Cooktown’s harbor-
master. One of his duties is to row out
every evening to light the two red lanterns
which serve as guides to the harbor, re-
turning to extinguish them in the morn-
ing. On every trip he is accompanied by
a lean and hungry-looking shark, which
cruises hopefully around the base of the
dolphin as he stands up and reaches for
the light; the poor beastie has been wait-
ing for years for him to make that one
slip that will give it a feed. Those same
lights are a headache to the newcomer.
In addition to them there are three bright
red beacons around the airstrip, and on
a dark night the problem is not so much
to close the lights as to close the right
ones. I spent my first night there on a
mudbank, having gambled on the wrong
pair.

“Plop”: Sydneysiders walking between
Wynyard and St. James stations are in
imminent danger of being shanghaied by
the driver and conductor of the bus that
goes along that route. I’ve watched them
driving their white-and-green elephant up
that trail, and have seen them eagerly
pull up at the stopping places, hopefully
looking for passengers who rarely come.
Once my heart softened for them and I
boarded the vehicle. The conductor
beamed on me, and, taking my fare, told
me that he might, after all, get into a
new book of tickets before his super-
annuation set in. The driver was elated
also, and told me to empty my fountain-
pen and fasten my safety-belt. When
we completed the three-minute, three-
penny journey I left them feeling that I
should have shaken hands and that they
hated to see me go.
« * * *
“Camber”: “Ex-C.G.’s” query as to
what the makers of tomato-sauce would
do if there were no pies (B. 16/6/’4B)
makes me wonder how many pies would
be sold if tomato-sauce were unprocur-
able. Of the two, I’d say sauce the
more indispensable, for it will at least
“go with” viands other than pies, whereas
—well, apart from tomato-sauce, what
will pies go with?

“Suvic”: Big Jim’s ’chute-jump had
been 0.K., but the Jerries had got him
and he was between stone walls and
hungry. Entered a Jerry guard with a
water-jug, black bread and synthetic jam.
“Essen ?” he asked. To Jim the word
conveyed not the German meaning “to
eat,” but danger of reprisals for raids on
the Krupp town. They weren’t going to
pin that on him, “No, no!” said he.
“Give me something to eat,” The guard
shrugged, left the water and took away
the bread and jam. Next morning, and
the next, the same thing happened. On
the fourth morning Jim, made desperate
by the “deliberate torture” of the daily
appearance of the bread, answered the
guard with “Essen be damned. Give me
that bloody bread,” and snatched the
loaf. “Essen, gut!” said the guard
amicably, and Jim’s jaws stopped as the
great light dawned.

“Feijoa”: Professor Paton informed
the Standing Committee on Convocation
at Melbourne University that an under-
graduate had been studying for a degree
since 1924 and hadn’t got through yet.
There was the case of a woman
who had sat for 11 years for her medical
examinations without getting beyond
second year. An amendment was made
in the regulations to deal with such space-
wasting cases, but there is still a loop-
hole. A student can play about with two
subjects, and as long fas he doesn’t repeat
the same two subjects each year he can
stay at his Alma Mater for ever; his
enrolment can be cancelled only if he
fails in two subjects on two consecutive
occasions. The student mentioned by
the professor apparently likes the quiet,
sheltered life of “the shop” better than
the hurly-burly outside it, like an-
other student who spent 18 years at the
institution, got degrees in science, medi-
cine, engineering and other subjects and
made no attempt to practise any of them.
♦♦* % *
“Awmsie”: An old-age pensioner
found wounded in the head in Sydney
last week had a few days earlier made
arrangements for his own funeral. He
was apparently actuated by the same feel-
ing of consideration for others as was
shown by another old boy I met
recently. He sat down beside me on
the tram, puffing and red in the face after
a trot up the hill. “Just made it,” I re-
marked. “Yes,” he panted. “Stupid thing
to do. Should’ve waited for the next.
My ticker, y’ know,” He tapped his
heart. “Yes, the doctor told me I’m likely
to go off any minute. Told me to take
care of myself, but hang it all, what’s
the good of being alive if you’re taking
care all the time? A man’s got to take
some chances.” He fumbled in his pocket
and pulled out a neatly-typed card.
“Look at this. My name, address and
phone number; address and phone
number of the doctor who’s treating me
See this name? He’s a funeral director.
I went to him, chose my coffin and got
measured for it. Paid for the funeral
and fixed up with the cemetery to bury
me alongside my little girl. It’s all on
the card. If I pop off suddenly whoever
finds me will be able to read it all. I
don’t want to be a nuisance to anyone
after I’m dead. But as for taking care —
well, if a man’s going to start worrying
about that at my time of life he might as
well be in his grave.” He put the card
in his pocket and went on to talk about
world affairs.
* * * ♦
“Swoper”: Women are contradictory
creatures. Mrs. Swoper has for years
been a leader in her set in attacking the
Chifley Government and in demanding
the removal of Government controls and
a return to some semblance of freedom.
She steamed furiously into the kitchen
the other morning after hearing the
radio announce the end of meat and
clothes rationing. “Isn’t it just like them!
Go and abolish coupons like that.
There’ll be a stampede at the shops;
the butcher won’t have any meat.
They” . “Hold on,” I cried. “I
thought you wanted freedom. I thought
you wanted controls wiped out and”
“So I do, so I do,” she stormed. “But
they needn’t have been so sudden about
it. I wasn’t ready.”

“Clooter”; Dancing was an enjoyable
experience in my day, and the kind of
dancing we did was based on the old
festival dances of our ancestors, who
danced to express their pleasure with all
sorts of things, from successful harvests
to marriages. The other night at a local
“hop” I saw some youngsters jitterbug-
ging. Joy was the last thing their faces
“Now I can see what I'm doing. I'll need one of your bobby-pins
“Never mind about your post-mortem —that ll come later.
expressed; indeed, they stamped and
wriggled and “jittered” as though in pain,
their faces intent as is the straining
athletes, their eyes narrowed in concen-
tration, their lips tight with anxiety. The
performance itself is obviously the off-
spring of the African jungle, where the
dancing is done to propitiate savage gods,
intimidate an enemy or incite to killing
—in any event exhausting and orgiastic.
Maybe I’m old and prejudiced, but I could
see nothing graceful in the exhibition,
such rhythm as there was being fevered
and alien, and when the music stopped
the jitterers looked about them with a
dazed, lost air. “How did it go?” I asked
a couple near me. “Grouse —extra
grouse,” said the lad. The lass turned up
her eyes and sighed “Oh boy, what it
feeds me.” I got my hat and went home.
« * * *
“M’s Boy”: He stopped me in Syd-
ney’s Martin-place in the midst of home-
going thousands. “Say, mate, you see
anythin’ of a bloke named Tom Smith?”
he asked. “Who’s Tom Smith?” “I
dunno,” he answered, “but I got t’ meet
him here t’ find out about a truck he’s
got for sale. The boss said t’ ask any-
body in Martin-place, but I bin askin’
for an hour an’ done no good.” And with
a puzzled and anxious expression he re-
sumed the search. But who said Aus-
tralian initiative was dead? Next day
the footpath and sundry buildings bore
the chalked legend: “Tom Smith. Ring
FZ1002.”

“Bo”: Upholding an appeal against a
workers’-compensation judgment, New
South Wales Chief Justice Jordan held
that an artificial denture is not part of
a person’s body. There are bound to
be repercussions. Presumably a smart
Gent One, defending a client accused of
“occasioning bodily harm” by biting an
arresting cop’s ear to pulp, may now
successfully plead that the deed was per-
formed, not by his innocent client, but
by a pair of foreign bodies which hap-
pened fortuitously to be inside his mouth
at the time and over which he had no
control. And those refreshment-room
diners who hope to replace an ancient
set of ersatz tats with a new acrylic
streamlined model by suing the Railways
Commissioners when a case-hardened
baked spud has done its fell work may
as well throw in the towel. Their next-
best plan is to pocket the spud and later
try to reduce it to an edible state by
putting it under a steam-hammer.

“Pitt St.”: There never was such a
tearing-up and laying-down of tram-
tracks and roads as goes on in the heart
of Sydney just now, with jack-hammers
shattering the peace, laden trucks roar-
ing, gangs of men more or less busy in
all directions. For what? Merely that
the overloaded, slow and cumbersome
trams can go on being overloaded, slow
and cumbersome.
« * ♦ ♦
“Becks”: At the risk of being called
a pedant I must protest against one of
the commonest grammatical errors com-
mitted by people who consider them-
selves educated. Thanks to subs, and
proof-readers it seldom gets into print,
but apparently radio-stations don’t em-
ploy the equivalent of those watchdogs,
so it is possible for a “roundsman” to
get away with “That sort of thing often
happens to we men” without realising
he is murdering the King’s English just
as much as the factory lass who remarks
“Us girls are going to a party tonight.”
Most people know the second construc-
tion is wrong, but many seem to think
that because of that the first one is there-
fore right. A similar line of reasoning
leads the half-educated to use “Between
you and I” because they know the un-
educated are wrong in saying, “You and
me did so-and-so.” Both the “to we
men” and the “between you and I” errors
are pitfalls into which would-be “re-
fained” folk most generally fall. Radio
announcers, as exemplars of the art of
speaking, should avoid them like the
plague.
* * * •
“Zake”: Grudgingly I admire the airy
manner adopted towards high-priced
clobber by those who move constantly
among it. I was browsing along an over-
coat rack in a city store when a large man
with a blue undershot jaw marched up
to an adjoining rack and began apprais-
ing the wares. Bearing down upon him,
a salesman whom Nature had obviously
intended for the peerage opened up in
haughty manner. “You’ll certainly like
this line, I’m sure. Built-up armpits, self-
supporting back, telescopic sleeves, non-
skid collar, cold-rolled lapels, caterpillar
belt and non-inflammable buckle, made
entirely of yak hair, lined with silver
lame, Bond-street cut, quite the best im-
ported coat we’ve handled since the war
and available at the very practical price
of twenty-four guineas. Now” Here
the customer’s jaw seemed to shoot for-
ward a few more inches. “You can,” he
broke in stolidly, “show me something
impractical, then, and”—as the lordly
one fell back, horror on his face —“some-
where about five quid! ”
* * * *
“Tummas McN.”: The other day Pro-
fessor Friedmann, of the Chair of Pub-
lic Law at Melbourne Uni., gave a lec-
ture on “The Planned State and the Rule
of Law,” in which he sought to show
how the planners and the law-makers
should seek some common ground, hold-
ing that restriction of individual freedom
of action was necessary for the common
benefit. So it is, in some things, but there
are others where the restrictions are un-
necessary, maddening and extravagant.
Anyhow, Chief Justice Latham was
prompted to remark, perhaps with deeper
feeling than his audience suspected, that
though planning may succeed with inani-
mate objects, humans didn’t like being
planned, adding that “Anyone who has
tried to be head of a household, with
wife and children, will realise this.” All
the same, he seemed to think that plan-
ning and freedom were reconcilable and
thereby expressed one of the biggest
threats the individual faces —that leaders
of the community have come to accept
the absurd notion that the official planner
is a necessary evil. He isn’t, being noth-
ing more than a sort of fungus left by
the war, obstructing progress as it was
never obstructed before.
♦ * * *
“S.G.”: Years ago in a Brisbane
boxing-ring Sluggo and Shrewdie had
fixed up the result of their contest in
advance. Both men’s connections had
their money well-placed on Shrewdie ; the
fight was to go the full 15 rounds and
was to be so conducted that, although on
paper Sluggo should have won easily, the
verdict would go to Shrewdie on points.
The fight dragged on from round to
round in a most friendly fashion. The
fans howled advice at the two pugs and
several times the ref. told them to put
a bit more life into it, but they stuck to
their plan and tapped their way in gentle-
manly style through to the last round. But
they reckoned without the referee. De-
spite Shrewdie’s obvious lead on points,
he crowned Sluggo. Poor old Sluggo
was flabbergasted. “Honest, Mister,” he
protested, ‘7 didn’t win.”
THE OLD. OLD STORY.
The chap who gets a blackened optic stopping
A punch, when out upon some giddy lark,
Can always kid he got it firewood-chopping
Or stumbling into something in the dark,
Or cite a dozen other ways of copping
The ornament that moves unkind remark.
He has unfettered choice of quite a lot
Of explanations, credible or hot.
But note the diff’rence when a politician,
Maybe, or not, in court, is asked tp throw
Some light upon his sudden acquisition
At some past date of a thick wad of dough.
His choice is narrowed down to one submission,
The old inevitable gag we know
So well. A thoroughly successful day
Upon the racecourse brought the brass his way.
He can’t recall the coups he executed,
The long-priced winners that he shrewdly
“specked”;
The names of bookmakers- whose bags he looted
■ You leam he cannot rightly recollect.
But since a statement cannot be refuted
When it’s impossible to have it checked,
He feels that any tale, however tall,
Is an improvement upon none at all.
“He won it at the races.” And the hoary.
Familiar yarn once more in court begins,
The record of a punter’s day of glory,
Mostly provocative of sceptic grins.
The seasoned subterfuge, the old, old story
For otherwise inexplicable wins,
The plea on which the cornered still rely
For what they designate an alibi!

Few cos. are more fortunately placed
than this one, which is steadily extend-
ing the scope of its activities. In Aus-
tralia it is engaged mainly in refining and
selling all but a small fraction (handled
by Millaquin) of the entire sugar output
under Government contract, in milling
on its own account —it owns seven of
the country’s 36 mills—and in the pro-
duction of building materials and indus-
trial and other chemicals, which are two
rapidly-expanding sections of the busi-
ness. In Fiji it is both miller and grower,
and owns: a pineapple cannery, too. There
is a refinery at Auckland (N.Z.). And
trade earnings are supplemented by re-
turns from a fine wad of investments out-
side the business.
The spring of £78,031 in.last term’s
net result followed a better output of raw
sugar in Australia (584,000 tons, up
48.000 tons) and Fiji (140,000 tons, up
25.000 tons) and a lift in the price paid
by the British Government, which takes
all the exportable surplus—here the co.
scores heaviest from its Fiji business. In
the building-materials and chemical sec-
tions production was around the previous
year’s levels. The £1,241,504 of profit-
best yet —was 10.6 p.c. on the £11,700,000
of capital as against 9.9, 7.5, 7.5, 7.4,
8.9, 7.9, 9 and 9.4 p.c. back to 1940. It
was written after allowing £434,654 (up
£14,386) for depreciation; and there are
less conspicuous corners in which surplus
earnings have been tucked away in the
past. The div. was lifted half a point,
making it 9 p.c.
With one eye on the history of the
business, the market anticipates a still
better rate of distribution and/or other
benefits later on, though it might have to
wait some time before its hopes are
realised. After fluctuating between
£59 ss. and £63 2s. 6d. since the begin-
ning of 1948, the f.-p. £2O shares are now
priced at £6O, at which figure the return
is 3 p.c, on a 9 p.c, div. basis, or 4.2 p.c.
should the distribution rise to 12f p.c.,
which was the rate paid prior to the
capitalisation (£5,850,000) in 1934. Net
tangible cover (book value) is £34 3s.
per share, of which £ll 12s. is represented
by replacement and depreciation reserve.
Last year’s result was a heartening per-
formance, considering the effects of wage
lifts, introduction of the 40-hour week,
rise in prices (including a 40 p.c. lift in
freight rates), scarcity of labor, strikes
and go-slow on the waterfront (with con-
sequent delays in delivery of raws from
northern ports) and shortage and poor
quality of coal. Over the last nine years
there has been a drop of 15 p.c. in the
calorific value of fuel used by the co.;
this alone means the mining, transport
and handling of an extra 18,000 tons of
fuel and 4000 tons of ash annually.
The biggest problem facing the sugar
industry today is, chairman Knox says,
the handling through the ports of the
huge carry-over from the 1947 season,
plus the 1948 production, which is ex-
pected to reach 800,000 tons raws, pro-
vided all the cane grown can be har-
vested. There is now 40 p.c. more ship-
ping tonnage engaged on the Australian
coast than before the war, yet less cargo
is transported. Before the war a monthly
average of 100,000 tons raws was shipped
regularly from North Queensland ports ;
last season the average was only 41,000
tons a month. The calamitously slow rate
of work by watersiders, coupled with
labor disputes, prevents shippers and con-
signees obtaining adequate service. Re-
cent shortages of refined sugar were due
to intermittent arrival of raws from
Queensland and shortage of coal and
labor. Demand has not yet caught up
with the co.’s refining capacity (about
500,000 tons p.a.), which is being further
increased as materials and labor permit.
During the year £379,792 net was
added to the book value of refineries,

There are sound reasons for believing
that assets are worth a lot more than their
book value. Delays in delivery, etc,,
show up in a growth of £1,822,463 in
stocks, financed mainly from the co.’s
own cash resources (down £1,409,216).
The more-or-less liquid surplus was
£171,956 stronger at £6,393,565, despite
the outlay on fixed assets.
The co.’s industrial chemical works at
Rhodes, near Sydney—in the books at
£190,327 —together with 30 acres of land
there, are presently to be passed to a
subsidiary, which is to turn out acetic
anhydride, ascorbic acid and vitamin 81.
Of the £4,627,458 at which investments

All-round expansion of business, to-
gether with a continued rise of prices, put
the lift into last term’s figures. Hie co.
widened the spread of its net by re-
opening old marine agencies in Belgium,
France, Germany and Holland, and by
setting up new ones in Italy and Sweden.
Most of the 18 Asiatic and island
branches that folded up following the Jap
invasion began contributing to the pool
again over a year ago. The fracas in
Palestine and in India and Pakistan
affected the cb.’s interests in those
countries; but whatever was lost in one
way was picked up, with more besides,
in another in Australia and elsewhere.
An extra £282,430 was gathered in
gross premiums (£1,027,431). Reinsur-
ances (£383,697) were £92,580 heavier,
leaving the gain in net premiums at
£189,850:

Continued pilfering of cargoes, during the
voyage and on the wharves, and the still
unsatisfactory nature of workers’-compen-
sation and motor-vehicle business sent
last year’s loss rate up by £5 2s. p.c.
However, this was more than offset by a
saving of £6 14s, p.c, in the expense ratio,
to which efficient management and aboli-
tion of War-time (Co.) Tax both con-
tributed —provision for taxation (£15,274)
was less than half the previous year’s
allowance.
The underwriting surplus was £35,360
stronger at £94,720, of which £75,000 was
transferred to the reserve for unexpired
risks (£275,500), making it 40 p.c. of the
year’s net premiums, which is the ratio
usually considered adequate for the pur-
pose. The £19,720 that remained, to-
gether with £18,569 (up £2716) net from
interest and rents, made the net amount
available for shareholders £38,289 (up
£3076), or 19.5 p.c. on capital as against
17.9 p.c. for the previous year. The
cautious board added half a point to the
div,, lifting it to 9£ p.c., the final being at
the rate of 10 p.c. p.a., which calls for
only £1053 more than last year’s net in-
terest and rents turned in.

Public securities, fixed deposits and cash,

assets, which are well worth their book
value. After allowing for the final div.,
the year’s growth in net assets (£740,972)
was £104,648.
Although underwriting runs into bad
patches at times, the market notes that
overall the theory of averages workfc well,
and offers 425. for the pound shares paid
to 10s. each. The return at 425, is 2.4 p.c.
on a 10 p.c. div. basis. The investor who
looks for 3.5 p.c. on his money coufits on
a 15 p.c. distribution, or other benefits.
Including the reserve for unexpired risks
(13s. Id, per share) net tangible cover is
275. 2d.

In the few weeks since trade with the
N.E.I. has been permitted again by the
diplomatic plenipotentiaries on our
wharves, Brooke’s Lemos has busied itself
in salvaging what it can of that once-
promising export market, though the
chairman thinks it’s “far too late” to dis-
lodge the U.S. and other competitors who
have been digging-in for the past three
years. It was recognised long ago by the
board of Brooke’s Lemos—which turns
out a wide range of cordials', canned
foods and sauces—that the war-time ex-
pansion in local food-canning for the
Allied services couldn’t be sustained in
peace without new overseas markets. To-
day, when the industry’s productive
capacity represents something like three
times the home demand, its Eastern mar-
kets are jeopardised and preferential ad-
vantages in Britain have been cut by the
recent Geneva Agreement, Only ob-
stacles at the supply end, in fact, are
forestalling an era of intense competition
in which, as this cO.’s chairman forecast
in 1944, “survival will be the reward of
efficiency.”
Brooke’s bid for efficient and bigger
output has taken the form of heavy out-
lays on plant, as well as a second factory
built in 1943 on Crown land at Fisher-
men’s Bend, Melbourne, at a cost of
nearly £lOO,OOO. None of this equip-
ment has so far been put to full use,
owing to shortages of labor, tinplate,
glassware and fuel. Apart from general
cost-increases and the return of advertis-
ing commitments since 1945, turnover has
diminished with a consequent rise in over-
head per unit. The introductory profit
table scarcely brings out the fall in recent
earning-power—the latest tax provision
being less than half that for 1945;
1939. 1945. 1946. 1947.

General expenses were 61 p.c. of gross,

Balance-sheet figures generally reflect
the reduced post-war business, except that
stocks showed a further £15,867 rise last
term, which has been cut back since the
cfose of accounts ; concerned at “present
extravagant values,” the board is on
guard against the danger of inventory

Kuala Lumpur Tin, N.L.
This Melbourne-controlled co., which
operates at Selangor, Malaya, got its
No. 2 dredge (capacity 150,000 c.y. a
month) going again in June, 1947, and the
operating face was reached on July 15.
For 2\ months to close of accounts at
end Sept., 218,263 c.y. were treated for
54.7 tons to., an average of 0.561 b. per
yard. Average value per yard was
15.543 d., of which operating costs took
7.582 d. After allowing for taxation
(£413), trading profit for the period was
£6779, and £l3B was received from the
Buffer Pool, making £6917, equal to
5.2 p.c. on capital. For the eight months
to end May, 1948, the dredge dug
887,000 c.y. for 133.5 tons to., an aver-
age of 0.3371 b. per yard.
No. 1 dredge (capacity 90,000 c.y. a
month) will not be re-equipped until the
board is satisfied that prospects warrant
the expenditure involved —the machine is
in poor mechanical condition. In front
of it is 2,232,000 c.y. of 0.61 b. ground.
Immediately ahead of No. 2 is 12,848,000
c.y., bored to average o.Bllb. In addition
there are 72.3 acres yet to be bored.
At end September last cash, debtors’
balances, etc,, totalled £35,772. There
was £9503 coming to sundry creditors.
Paid capital is £130,800 in 200,400 £1
shares, of which 113,400 are fully-paid
and the balance paid to 4s. each.
In London tin averaged £5426 12s. 3d.
for 1947. For the first five months of
1948 the average was approx. £SSI9, and
the figure rose to £5569 on June 1.

From London: Gold Fields
Australian Development Co.’s
report on its Westralian interests
for the last half of 1947 shows
that Mt, Ida produced 1456 fine
oz.; milling stopped and work
was concentrated on lode de-
velopment, and the main shaft
was sunk from No. 4 to No. 6
level. Moonlight Wiluna: Re-
treatment of residues, in which
co. holds a 9 p.c. interest, yielded
6325 fine oz. from approximately
60,000, tons ; several hundred
thousand tons remain to be
treated. Porphyry: Co. holds
a one-third interest in this
property, where underground
work was suspended last Novem-
ber in order to concentrate on
overhaul of power, milling and
treatment plants: and erection of
new machinery. Mt. Charlotte:
The three years’ option, in which
the co. has a 25 p.c. interest,
commenced on January 1 last.
General: Westralian labor and
stores position remains a prob-
lem, and has tended to de-
teriorate rather than improve.
With the end of the monsoon
season, investigational work in
Malaya, in conjunction with
Wiluna Gold Mines, Ltd,, has
been retimed.

reports a loss of £1961 for the

After a visit to Big Bell
(W.A.) Yankee chairman R. F.

closure had thrown development
behind, and, until brought up to
date, the property would have a

crushing machinery would be in-
stalled to bring throughput to
over 40,000 tons a month and
make provision for treatment of
sulphide ore from the lower
levels as the oxides became ex-
hausted. As regards the sale
of gold, he said some foreign
mines had been able to sell their
product on the world’s open
markets, but only a minor
amount of world production
changed hands in this way.

"LABOR'S' 1 CORRUPTION OF DEMOCRACY.
The failure of industry in
Australia, the apparent cause of
which is the breakdown of in-
dustrial law and order (especi-
ally obvious on the coalfields
and along the waterfront today),
arises primarily from “Labor’s”
corruption of democracy. With-
out a return to democratic gov-
ernment and social principles
there will be no return to a
progressive and fully productive
industrial Australia.
There are still some people
in Australia who believe that the
“Labor” movement of the pre-
sent day is the most democratic
• thing this country has ever
seen. People who so believe
surely cannot think; they are
possibly deluded by a “social
services” set-up that binds the
citizen more than it gives him
“security.” “Labor” today is
rife with vested interests, with
opportunists out for their own
personal aggrandisement and
gain, with tinpot tyrants and
would-be dictators, with those
who would restrict the free-
dom of speech of their politi-
cal opponents, with totali-
tarian-minded adventurers who
have dealings and agree-
ments with Communists, and
with those who aim to divide
and mislead the people in order
to produce a political and in-
dustrial revolution with a final
objective anything but demo-
cratic.
Directly in opposition to
democratic principles, “Labor”
at present is attempting to jerry-
mander the electorates in order
to remain in Governmental
power against the wishes of the
people. Mr. Chifley has been
brazenly dictatorial in his de-
fiance of popular opinion in re-
gard to the nationalisation of
banking, for which he has never
had a mandate from the people.
And when the electorate rejected
his appeal for the permanent
transfer of price-control powers
from the States to the Common-
wealth his frustration and an-
noyance could not be concealed.
Under Chifleyism, “Labor”
has attempted to impose eco-
nomic martial law upon the
nation. Very grudgingly has it
repealed National Security Regu-
lations. And under Mr. Chifley’s
predecessor, Mr. Curtin, there
was an attempt to vastly widen
the powers of the central Gov-
ernment at Canberra over the
rights and liberties of the citizen.
Actually the “Labor” Govern-
ments Australia has seen since
1941 have been the greatest
menace to democracy the nation
has ever experienced. Every *
Curtin Ministry and Chifley
Ministry has been a frail sup-
port to the principles of de-
mocracy, and the positive
action taken against our demo-
cratic system over seven years
adds up to a very large
amount. The failure of
(\hifley, his Ministers and his
and their predecessor to main-
tain democratic principles and
standards arises partly from the
domination of “Labor” Gov-
ernments by the trade-union
movement, in turn coerced by
self-seeking adventurers, para-
sites and Moscow agents, but
also to a great extent by the in-
adequacies, prejudices and reck-
less opportunism in some of the
Ministers themselves. After close
on half a century of Federation,
an all-time “low” in Common-
wealth Governmental standards
has been established.
A Ministry which lacks prin-
ciples and standards of decency
in conduct cannot faithfully
serve a democracy. Australia
has thus been ill-served for
almost seven years. The Gov-
ernment has been representative
more of those who do not be-
lieve in national service than of
those who do. It has been an
agency for pressure politics and
vested interests to an extent
never before seen in Australia.
Envy and vain ambition rather
than ability have been the
motive forces behind its restric-
tions on private initiative, its
derision of the efforts (and re-
sults) of what it chooses to call
the “capitalist system.” “Spoils
to the victors” has been an all-
too-evident feature of “Labor”
policy; “Labor” Ms.P. have
been there with both hands when
it was a case of feathering their
own nests in matters of in-
“And they harmonise perfectly!”
creased Parliamentary salaries,
pensions and -otherwise.
The law is the democratic
citizen’s last refuge in the case
of victimisation and oppression.
“Labor” has sought to under-
mine the authority of the law,
and in its “law”-making has
added nothing to the stature or
dignity of the law. It has shown
an alacrity in enforcing the law
more against political minorities;
or against those of an opposite
political color. Whilst the large,
employment-giving industrialist
has been readily enough brought
to book for breaches of prices
and other regulations, the black-
market has flourished in a way
that has aroused great political
curiosity. And while “Labor”
has small respect for law, of
equity it knows almost nothing.
The trade-union movement has
been allowed to flaunt the law
with the greatest of impunity.
And promoters of industrial
lawlessness have actually been
on the Government expenses
account; Comrade Thornton, of
the Ironworkers’ Union, has re-
ceived travelling expenses and
fees from the Chifley Govern-
ment, and there have been other
cases of the same thing, one in-
volving Comrade Healy, the
Communist boss of the Water-
side Workers’ Federation. Demo-
cracy has not been allowed to
work even within the trade-
union movement. The Chifley
Government will not enforce the
secret ballot where unions are
asked to decide upon whether
they shall strike or not; union-
ists are usually intimidated by
professional disruptionists into
voting the way the militants
want them to vote. Or else
unionists are deterred from
attending meetings altogether.
“Labor” Governments and the
trade-union movements, both
subject to the influence of the
treacherous Communist party,
have gravely corrupted the
workings of Australian de-
mocracy since 1941. Envy,
prejudice, experimentalism, op-
portunism, the seeking of per-
sonal power and selfish gain, as
well as the effects of straightout
Communist treachery (described
by Mr. Chifley as a “phil-
osophy”), have made “Labor”
Governments incapable of carry-
ing on the traditions of a pro-
gressive and democratic Aus-
tralia. The efforts of those Aus-
tralians who devoted their lives,
sometimes sacrificing them, in
the service of their country
during war-time have never
been treated with the respect and
appreciation to which they are
entitled. The hard work and
thrift of past generations in
establishing our industries, our
transport and financial systems
have been treated with scorn,
though not without regard to the
possibility of political exploita-
tion.
In the cause of political op-
portunism and a socialist revo-
lution, with Communist pressure
on the side, “Labor” has brought
the country to a state where
trade-unionist strikes against
trade-unionist, and where one
wage-earner polls upon the
other. In a multitude of ways
the productive capacity of the
country is being sabotaged and
the welfare of all jeopardised.
Coal is being deliberately with-
held from industry, and produc-
tion has never been allowed to
regain the figure achieved in
1942-43, when the Communist
union bosses felt they were help-
ing Soviet Russia by sanctioning
increased output. Every capital
city in Australia is shockingly
short of coal at the present time.
The effect on our industry is
being felt in Britain, which again
represents the European strong-
point against the Soviet dom-
ination of Europe. Here again
Australian “Labor” members,
apparently by reason of their
antecedents in. many cases, have
assisted the Communist plot by
their cold attitude towards the
British cause. In the case of Dr.
Evatt, his failure to co-operate
adequately with Britain appears
to rise from nothing more
worthy than a desire to hog
the limelight.
The central “Labor” Govern-
ment in Canberra is mainly
responsible for the plight in
which Australia finds itself to-
day. Canberra “Labor” for the
best part of seven years has had
powers, conferred by war-time
statute and by taxing and spend-
ing authority, which no Govern-
ment of this Commonwealth has
ever possessed before. It has not
used these powers, as a whole,
in the cause of democratic gov-
ernment. Instead it has struck
at private enterprise in its
legitimate forms and retreated
from the attacks of selfish
“Labor” vested interests and the
“mimicking Molotovs” of the
Communist party. It has pro-
vided a “full - employment”
scheme which protects the mis-
chievous and irresponsible trade-
union elements from the results
of their own mischief, thus re-
ducing the possibility of normal
industrial discipline. Harmony
between employer and wage-
earner has been deliberately dis-
couraged by Ministers of the
stamp of Mr. Ward.
The “Labor” Governments we
have seen since 1941 believe in
government of the people not
for the people but for the party
—the party’s vested in-
terests. Taxation of the people
isn’t for the people—but for the
party. And so, with Communist
collusion, government of the
people, by the people, for the
people is in danger of perishing
from this continent.
Australia will never know
democratic government and the
rule of law under Mr. Chifley
and his Ministry. And it will
never know peace in industry
and the enjoyment of a high liv-
ing standard by the people until
democratic government is re-
turned to the community.

Round and About
Though bad weather in June
has threatened, blustered and at
times burst, the astonishing fact
remains that most of the im-
portant out-of-doors events have
escaped disaster.
For the Derby, again held on
a Saturday, conditions were
ideal. Much of its old cosmo-
politanism seems to have gone;
the crowd present might have
been any Saturday-afternoon
gathering, uniform in orderli-
ness and respectability. Rain-
clouds hung over the course on
the first day of Royal Ascot, but
the two brief showers spoiled
neither the pageantry nor the
bravest display of millinery seen
since the war.
The Open-air Theatre in
Queen Mary’s Gardens, Regent’s
Park, did not have its first night
ruined by a quite un-Shak-
spearean tempest as happened
last year. This season —and
every one seems to triumph over
adversity—has begun with “As
You Like It.”
There is music for the masses
at Harringay Arena, which, so
far as distractions from the
railway are concerned, has a
situation similar to Prince Alfred
Park, Sydney. Capacity crowds
of 10,000 or so fill the stands,
while the London Symphony
Orchestra, seemingly raised high
on banks of flowers, plays under
spotlights in the middle of the
greyhound track.
Of another out-of-doors event,
the first of a series of five on
which nation-wide interest is
focused, it is true to say that
Englishmen would have been
deeply sorry if bad weather had
denied its completion. And that
goes for Lords also, of course.
The Trooping of the Color
was the fiasco of the month. It
was not the ceremony nor the
weather but the weather fore-
cast. Experts confidently pre-
dicted rain ; the authorities were
bound to take their advice and
abandon the ceremony. The
rain held off. No other genera-
tion would have dared to sug-
gest that the Guards in bearskins
and scarlet tunics were fair-
weather soldiers. It is, perhaps,
a sad thought that austerity
makes them so.
Coal
Mr. Gaitskell (June 10) said
that the coal outlook was “not
so good now as it had been,”
On looking back over the three
years since 1945 one is forced to
wonder whether, at any time
during that period, the word
“good” can have been a happy
choice. It is too easy to quote
statistics, as is done regularly,
and to present them so that they
don’t look as bad as they are.
The one important question
that seems to evade an answer
is: “Are we producing enough
coal?” Perhaps it is too simple
to be answered. The Coal
Board’s target of 211 million
tons for 1948 was comfortable
rather than ambitious, particu-
larly when the increasing use of
mechanical aids is taken into ac-
count. The total to the end of
May (85 million tons) shows a
deficit of nearly 3,000,000 tons.
If the target is to be reached,
nothing less than a substantial
margin from the early months
of the year would need to be
shown before holidays and pos-
sible higher absenteeism have
their effect.
Mr. Gaitskell made some
alarming statements, in tone
very different from those of
Lord Hyndley, chairman of the
National Coal Board, when he
spoke in March. Lord Hyndley
said that* the Board was export-
ing coal to every country in
Europe, and was about to send it
to South America. There were
in mind, he said, enormous plans
of reconstruction, and he wanted
coal exports to exceed the esti-
mated annual figure of 15 to 16
million tons by about a quarter.
Bringing us up to date, Mr.
Gaitskell drew the nation’s
attention to what he called “dis-
turbing tendencies” in the figures
since Easter. Production of
deep-mined coal was 100,000
tons a week below the target,
and there was likely to be a
“serious deficiency” of it. Deep-
mined coal, it may be mentioned,
accounts for slightly more than
one-half of Britain’s total ex-
ports. There would, Mr. Gait-
skell continued, probably be a
surplus of small uncleaned coal
(it was known, in other days
and with less dignity, as
“slack”), but most countries
were well stocked with it, so that
the Ministry of Fuel and Power
had difficulty in finding a mar-
ket.
Oversea buyers want large
(i.e., deep-mined) coal. Would
any competent business or-
ganisation consider it unreason-
able to supply a customer with
what he wanted if the goods
were in stock though difficult of
access?
The perplexed citizen, who
knows well enough that a busi-
ness must pay its way or be
wound up, can merely sigh more
deeply and hope that the day
will come when a new manage-
ment takes over.
Good Management
In any discussion on coalmin-
ing in Britain or, indeed, else-
where, it is impossible to get
very far before the name of Sir
Charles Reid is mentioned. Sir
Charles resigned from the
National Coal Board in May.
The statement that he made on
resignation is remarkable for
many things, not the least of
which was the absence of
columns of statistics; the only
figure he mentioned was the 30
million extra tons which he be-
lieved could be produced if the
industry were properly con-
ducted. '
Giving facts that were much
harder on the ears than any
figures, Sir Charles said that he
had no confidence either in it
(the N.C.8.) or in the organisa-
tion it had set up. Management
was “unhappy, uncertain of its
position and the extent of its
authority”; and some of the
best mining engineers were re-
signing from sheer frustration.
The organisation was “cumber-
some and uninspired,” and
could neither deal with prevalent
indiscipline nor give confident
and effective leadership.
Sir Charles, who started as an
apprentice office clerk and pit-
worker, has had a long and dis-
tinguished mining career; he
was chairman of the committee
which issued the Reid report on
technical reorganisation in the
coalmining industry. He be-
lieves in State-ownership of the
mines, with the proviso that “it
must be founded on sound busi-
ness principles, with fullest pos-
sible personal responsibility for
management at every level and
the authority which this de-
mands.”
Britons do not need to be
told, as they are almost every
other day, that the future of the
nation’s industry lies in good
management. What organisa-
tion doesn’t depend on the effi-
ciency of its management? The
responsible citizen is compelled
to wonder whether nationalisa-
tion and good management can
ever be found under the same
roof. Nationalisation, it would
seem, drives out the ablest
managers.
Flying Scotsman
On June 1 the Flying Scots-
man resumed its non-stop steam
run (the longest in the world) of
393 miles between King’s Cross,
London, and Waverley, Edin-
burgh. For nine years the train
has had several scheduled stops
on the journey. The trip now
takes seven hours 50 minutes,
against seven hours before the
war. The track is not back to
pre-war standards, but the speed
limit of the train has been raised
recently from 60 m.p.h. to 70
m.p.h.

SUNDRY SHOWS
At the Royal Art.
Two paintings, an oil land-
scape by Lance Solomon and a
watercolor flowerpiece by Mar-
garet Coen, are the highlights
of the Royal Art Society exhibi-
tion at David Jones’s Gallery,
Sydney.
The large flowerpiece is hang-
ing on the left of the gallery as
one enters, and the eye goes
straight to it. The dominant
tone is the blue and mauve of
wistaria, with subtle gradings of
color—warm orange, soft green
and rich red —all dramatised by
the artist’s brilliant use of white
as a focusing agent. Rich and
vivid, it blazes with the full
power of the medium.
Solomon’s “Golden Billabong”
is subdued at first glance; there
is the impression of trees, grow-
ing close together in a kind of
wild shrubbery, and, after that,
a creek. But all Lance Solo-
mon’s paintings have depth, and
the more one looks at them the
more there is to find. In
“Golden Billabong,” passing the
luxuriant and admirably bal-
anced tangle and riot of trees,
one comes to the focal point of
the picture: a gold shimmer on
the cup of the billabong, and,
looking out again, the gold light
is radiated and reflected in rich
specks of color in the massed
foreground. It is a very fine
picture, and a distinct develop-
ment in Lance Solomon’s
analysis of the forms, the light
and the poetry of the bush,
Roland Strasser’s “Mother of
Pearl, Bali,” was bought by the
N.S.W. National Art Gallery,
and has much to commend it—
chiefly Strasser’s flashing use of
color in the luminous sweep of
water and the drama of his
composition. Whether the ugly
and emaciated natives are a con-
cession to unfortunate fact or a
deliberate attempt to avoid the
pretty-pretty they remain a
blemish.
Among other pictures worth
special notice are watercolors by
G. K. Townshend and Rufus
Morris —G. K. Townshend re-
peats his grey-day subject with
his usual deftness, and Morris
is attempting paintings impres-
sive in size but, except for their
skies, uninteresting in their con-
tents’—and a tiny but excep-
tionally well-painted oil land-
scape, of dark hills and trees and
a silver-dark sky with a gap of
blue, by Garrett Kingsley, an
interesting and very promising
departure from his customary
nudes.
"The Flies."
What with “Hamlet” being
done, (Edipus - fashion, by
Olivier at the Athenaeum,
Eugene O’Neill describing the
Electra complex in Freud’s terms
at the Princess, and the Tin Alley
Players putting on this play by
Jean-Paul Sartre at the Uni-
versity’s Union Theatre, Mel-
bourne is getting more than its
share of the tragic dramatists of
ancient Greece dressed in the
New Look.
“The Flies” deals with the re-
turn of Orestes to his native
Argos', which is plagued with
insects and a guilty conscience
over the murder of his father,
Agamemnon, by his mother,
Clytemnestra, and her paramour,
ALgisthus. Electra is again de-
picted, much as in O’Neill’s
play, as the jealous daughter
making her bewildered brother
the instrument of her revenge on
the guilty parties. Orestes arrives
on the day when the citizens of
Argos indulge in an annual orgy
of remorse and the dead emerge
from the Shades to taunt the liv-
ing and spend the night with
their widows.
On the surface the situation
is as horrible as that in “Mourn-
ing Becomes Electra,” but there
is a difference. O’Neill illustrates
his theme in terms of human
beings, which, in a strange sort
of way, do live, while Sartre
manipulates his theme in terms
of universal symbols which
don’t live any more than G. B.
Shaw’s puppets.
* * * *
The Kuringai Theatre Guild
is presenting the Reunion
Players in “The Animal King-
dom” at Killara Hall. By Ameri-
can Philip Barry, the play is
about a publisher who has to
choose between his wife and his
erstwhile artist mistress.
Though the story has little
claim to originality, young
Rhonnie Webber plays the
artist with complete natural-
ness. John Unicomb, as
the drunken butler, is excellent,
and Joan Boulken’s inane sophis-
ticate is amusingly fatuous. The
play is so well cast and pre-
sented—it would be more so if
Gloria Crawford discarded her
statuesque posing and Ben
Gabriel sewed up his pockets—
that Miss Webber does not up-
set the balance by dominating it.
* * * *
The Independents at North
Sydney are playing “Jane Clegg,”
Ervine’s excellent, if depressing,
drama of lower-middle-class life,
with Madge Ryan, Raymond
Irons, Gwen Harrison, Peter
Buchanan and Gordon Rudd
in the principal roles.
♦ * * i*
Mayne Lynton will present
Shakspeare’s “Julius Ccesar” at
Sydney Royal for six matinees
—July 15, 16, 19, 20, 22 and 23.
Lynton, as Mark Antony,
Augustus Neville as Julius
Caesar, Edward Smith as Brutus
and John Faassen as Caius Cas-
sius will head the cast.
Erna Berger With
Orchestra.
The County Council must
have saved at least 61b. of coal
in not turning on the floodlights
when Erna Berger sang the
Gliere Concerto with the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra at the
Town Hall. The singer had
almost to grope her way to
Joseph Post’s rostrum, and those
of the audience who had eyes
like cats’ may even have seen
her face. But from somewhere
in the gloom a voice of exquisite
limpidity went through the
various laryngeal acrobatics pre-
scribed by the Soviet composer,
whose melodic bankruptcy was
thrown into stark relief by
Strauss’s “Voices of Spring,”
which Miss Berger sang later.
Borodin’s “Prince Igor” Over-
ture sat heavily on the chest;
Liadov’s “Eight Fairy Tales”
were better, and the bacchanalian
riot of Glazounov’s “Autumn”
found the orchestra at last in
fine fettle. De Greef’s “Suite of
Old Flemish Folk Songs” had
great charm, particularly the
calmly meditative strain of
“Wounded Is My Heart” and
the gaily-lilting “Hoepsaser.”
Nothing more delicate and re-
fined in singing has been heard
here than the soprano’s rendi-
tion of Gluck’s “O Del Mio
Dolce Ardor.” Lieder of Schu-
bert, Schumann and Wolff added
to a programme to tax the
singer’s interpretative equipment.
Few coloraturas could, at the
end of it, have given with such
dynamic power and resilience
the “Una Voce Poco Fa” from
Rossini’s “Barber of Seville” —
an aria bristling with all the
vocal difficulties.
* * * *
Solo singing of even quality,
though lacking at times in de-
clamatory fire, and full-blooded
choruses by the combined Bach
and Eastwood choirs marked
the fine concert version of
Handel’s “Acis and Galatea”
by Singers of Australia in
Sydney under the baton of
Werner Baer. The small string
and woodwind orchestra gave in
flowing style the graceful accom-
paniment to arias and choruses.
Outstanding among the solo
items were Elsie Findlay’s “Ye
Verdant Plains,” John Dudley’s
“Love Sounds th’ Alarm,”
Raymond Bektty’s recitative “I
Rage” and the air “O Ruddier
Than the Cherry,” and Lorenzo
Nolan’s “Stay, Shepherd, Stay.”
The whole work was an un-
broken stream of melody, and
Singers of Australia, in pre-
senting such operas, deserve far
greater support than they are
getting.
# * * *
Maureen Jones (piano), Theo
Salzman (cello), Richard Gold-
ner (viola), Robert Pikler with
hisi violin and Edward Cockman
as second violinist set the Musica
Viva Society on its highest peak
yet at Melbourne’s Assembly
Hall. Haydn’s String Quartet in
D Minor opened the proceed-
ings, and was. followed by
Beethoven’s String Quartet in B
Flat Major. One was as deli-
cately played as the other, but
it was in the complex Brahms A
Major Piano Quartet that these
fine players gave the most con-
vincing demonstration of their
mettle.
The programme, repeated at
the Sydney Conservatorium,
found the ensemble in the same
good form to do full justice to
works in which the best of the
classical and romantic schools
met and mingled.
Films.
“Mine Own Executioner’'’ (Syd-
ney Esquire): More psychological
lantana about the professional and
private problems of a psychiatrist
who has a dangerous lunatic for a
patient, a clumsy, devoted wife, and
a potential mistress. The problems
are more or less solved when the
patient shoots himself and takes off
from a 10-story building at the same
time. Discursive, but with some good
acting from Burgess Meredith.
“The Foxes of Harrow” (Syd-
ney Century): A thickly-spread melo-
drama about a dashing gambler with
a heart of gold who wins a plan-
tation, acquires an aristocratic wife
and spends several years waiting for
her to fall in love with him. Rex
Harrison strolls through the piece
with a mild air of disbelief.
“Sleep, My Love” (Sydney May-
fair) : Don Ameche and Claudette
Colbert in a powerful sedative.
“Summer Holiday” (Sydney
Liberty) has Mickey Rooney as an
adolescent in love with a small-town
banker’s daughter. A mix-up with
city chorus-girls in a roadhouse
threatens to jump adolescence abruptly
to maturity, but Walter Huston’s
fatherly advice and Frank Morgan’s
drunken example slow the process
to natural growth.


Women's Letters
From Sydney
The peoples of the world who speak
the same language as Shakspeare, and
Marlowe, and Milton, and Edgar Allan
Poe, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, and
Winston Churchill, and Thornton Wilder
have a bond so strong uniting them that
time and distance and politics cannot dis-
unite them. That is one of the reasons
why the English - Speaking Union,
founded by Sir Evelyn Wrench, is still
sturdily flourishing in England, the
Dominions and America. The N.S.W.
branch celebrated its silver jubilee last
week. There was a good rally at the re-
ception in the Australia to mark this
milestone. Influenza, the common enemy,
kept some of the members away, and
was the reason for the absence of Mrs.
Williams, wife of the United Kingdom’s
High Commissioner.
The Governor, Lieut.-General John
Northcott, was accompanied by Flight-
Lieut. Nash. Mr. Williams came under
his own steam, as it were. Mrs. Orsen
Nielsen, whose husband, the Consul-
General for U.S.A., is absent from Syd-
ney, came with Consular Knowlton Hicks
and daughter Betty. The Assistant Trade
Commissioner of Canada and Maori-
land’s Trade Commissioner were others
in the international group. The speeches
were very good, starting off with presi-
dent Aubrey Halloran’s easy and friendly
address. He gave a Welsh greeting to
the United Kingdom’s Mr. Williams, and
one in French to Canada’s representative
and in just plain English to the others.
There was music, too. Blonde little
pianist Berenice Montgomery, perched on
the Snowdon-like platform, played
serenely. Fair head, flower-printed
Hawaiian linen frock, cameo in the
narrow black ribbon at the throat
made a graceful composition. Kenneth
Stenton unrolled rich bass-baritone notes
and Esther McGilvray played the accom-
paniments. It was a nice party. You
didn’t have to be a student of Shak-
speare to know that Mrs. Orsen Nielsen’s
graceful dinner frock of pinky beige was
a honey, that the band of flame ribbon
on the skirt of Mrs. Persia Porter’s
sweeping black taffetas was a clever
touch, that Mrs. N, Wall’s black silk
velvets, the neckline outlined in grey-blue
silk point lace, was of French extraction.
Unionists attracting the eye were Mrs. H.
J. Brady, her ivory moires printed in
bright flowers, Dorothy Smith, Mrs.
Johnson and secretary Thelma Yeo. Mrs.
W- R. Dovey’s burgundy crepe frock was
softly draped.
Today Lt.-General Iven Mackay will
be given a lunch by the Institute of
Journalists. This time the Institute will
spread its tables in the Grand Central
Hotel. The General returned about a
week ago to Sydney, after being Aus-
tralian High Commissioner in India for
four years.
Singer Erna Berger sparkled in spite of
the congealing atmosphere of the Town
Hall last Wednesday light. Erna, just
returned from a successful season
through all the States and on her way to
London and later the Salzburg Festival,
made Gliere’s concerto for coloratura and
orchestra something to live in the
memory and an achievement for student
listeners to strive to emulate. Very un-
usual at an orchestral concert, the singer
gave an encore of Strauss’s' “Voices of
Spring,” which the audience had ap-
plauded earlier with something like
frenzy. Her frock was palely blue,
but in the pallidly-lit Town Hall
its color was almost lost. It was
of thick silk, very full and sway-
ing of skirt, and bare as to shoulder
(oh, sisters who shivered in your bunny
and silver-fox skins!) except for narrow
straps. The Civic Fathers will save on
their electricity bill during the present Ice
Age, for radiators will probably be “off”
as they were on Wednesday.
For over 56 years Mrs. Grundy, who
died last week-end, was connected with
the Australian theatre. A great number
of those years she was with J.C.W. Her
name (Emily Nathan) must have appeared
on literally thousands of The Firm’s
programmes. She married Tom Grundy,
an English actor. The best-known ward-
robe-mistress south of the Line, Mrs.
Grundy was a Melbourne girl whose
parents owned a guesthouse, Treasury
Lodge, beloved by all theatricals. The
first stage costume she made was for
Phoebe in a Gilbert and Sullivan produc-
tion just before J.C.W. came into promi-
nence. Her last costumes were for “Bala-
laika,” about 1937. The whole Australian
theatre world sorrows for her passing.
The Lord Mayor, Alderman Bartley,
and Mr. Orsen N. Nielsen, U.S.A. Consul-
General, who is now temporarily Charge
d’Affaires at Canberra, and Mrs. Nielsen
and Mr. K. V. Hicks, U.S. Consul,
temporarily in charge of the U.S.A. Con-
sulate-General, will be among the guests
at the American Independence Day Ball
next Monday at the Trocadero. Chair-
man of the American Independence Day
Ball committee is Mr. C. M. Van Epps.
In the week just ended 200 jolly
hockey girls slung their sticks into the
boot of the bullock-wagon and made
treks for home. They had been taking
part in Country Week, and are those girls
keen! Besides the fun there’s always a
chance that some of them will be selected
for inter-State teams. The play was
centred in Rushcutter Bay park ; matches
were between country teams and country
and metropolitan players. Of course the
rain poured on most of the games, and
many of the girls—alas! —went back home
to areas devastated by the recent floods.
Life wasn’t all strenuous —there were tea-
parties, a few theatre-nights and a stunt-
night in Anthony Hordern’s Welfare
Hall, when three of the country lasses en-
thralled their city sisters by the beauty of
their voices. Final burst of gaiety was
a picnic at National Park.
The Oliviers weren’t running any risk
in making entry into this State. They
travelled to Sydney last Sunday by air,
unknown and unsung (according to news-
paper reports incognito). Ah, well, per-
haps they had heard that Ned Kelly rides
again!
At History House last Wednesday
afternoon the 38th yearly meeting of
the Bush Book Club recounted a story of
a task well done. A total of 8000 books
and even larger numbers of illustrated
papers and magazines were sent away
in the year just ended. Last November’s
book-collection day was a great success,
over 1500 books, over 3000 papers and
magazines and £5O 19s. to buy books
being garnered. Extracts of letters ask-
ing for all types of books from Westerns
to “books of a high moral tone” were
read at the meeting by secretary Beulah
Bolton. Just returned from England,
Mrs. James Dickson was among the after-
noon’s speakers. There were many
ardent Bush Bookers in the audience,
among them the F. S. Burnell couple
and Mrs. Wilfred Fairfax, who is keenly
interested in the “Flying Book Club,”
the latest amenity of the Flying Doctor
service.
French violinist Ginette Neveu, visiting
Australia for the first time under engage-
ment to the A.8.C., is travelling with her
brother Jean, who will be her accom-
panist. Paris-born, Ginette, who made
her debut at the age of seven, comes of a
musical family—her great-uncle was com-
poser and organist Charles Wider. At
the age of 11 she won first-prize of the
Paris Conservatory; at 15 she won the
coveted Wieniawski Prize in Warsaw.
She was 20 when war broke out. Up till
then she had played in 110 cities of
Europe and North America. Last
season she played in England, Italy,
Switzerland, Scandinavia, Holland,
Belgium and France, and also made
appearances with the Vienna and Prague
Philharmonic Orchestras, and at the
Salzburg Festivals, Next Monday after-
noon she will be the guest-of-honor at a
reception given by the committee of the
Sydney Symphony Orchestral committee
in the drawing-room of the Royal Empire
Society,
Everybody is reading Bruce Marshall’s
Red Danube. Like all this writer’s
books, it is at once sad and amusing.
The time is post-war, and many of the
scenes are in a convent in Vienna in an
annexe of which a group of British
officers is billeted. And here is what
one of the nuns thought about the
colonel;
Sister Kasimira rather liked the colonel
and the way his breath often smelled of
trifle, which reminded her of when she had
been a little girl. Mother Auxilia seemed
to like the colonel, too, although she didn’t
seem to like him smelling of trifle so much,
because once when Sister Kasimira had
asked her whether she didn’t think it nice
she had replied a little tartly “White Horse
trifle, my dear,” and walked away.
A night with the Cymmrodorion
Society on July 17 will rally Welshmen
and -women to the 1.0.0. F. Hall in
Clarence-street. Baritone Hubert Evans
and pianist Pat Siedld will be the night’s
musicians.
From Melbourne
The Town Hall bloomed, with the help
of the Parks and Gardens committee,
like an English conservatory for the Lord
Mayor’s ball. It was the first since 1939 —
on that occasion it served to welcome to
Melbourne one of this State’s most
popular Governors, Sir Winston Dugan,
and Lady Dugan, who are still, to
the citizens’ delight, the King’s representa-
tives. On the stage was a lovely terraced
garden, with crazy path and tinkling
fountain set in green lawns and beds of
cyclamen, primulas and begonias. Hang-
ing baskets of small pink begonias toned
perfectly with the painted flowers on the
“conservatory roof,” and small fir-trees
gave off their spicy perfumes. To the roll
of drums the official party entered the
ballroom. Lady Dugan’s black velvet
gown was slightly trained, and there was
a bustle effect at the back of the waist.
One shoulder-strap was encrusted with
diamonds. The Governor’s sister, Mrs.
J. O, Haselden, wore a long, slim-fitting
violet velvet cloak over a silver lamd
gown. Lady Herring’s gown was of black
lace. Mrs. A. H. Drakeford’s black gown
was worn with a silver-fox cape. Mrs.
A. A. Lord topped a black crepe evening
skirt with an aqua-blue moire taffeta
jacket, slim-fitting and with a fishtail
back.
A lovely gown was chosen by Mrs. P. L.
Coleman. Of pale-pink Alen?on lace, the
pattern was picked out with shimmering
crystal beads. Made in the new penny-
brown shade, the heavy silk faille of Mrs.
Phillip Dare’s choice had the off-the-
shoulder boned bodice allied to a skirt
draped to the back to form a series of
pouffs and pencil-slim about the ankles.
Mrs. George Jones, wife of the air-
marshal, wore a gown of white satin
printed in a pattern of autumn flowers;
the full skirt was finished with a ruffled
hem. Mrs, W. K. Burnside’s lace gown
was in pale-apricot tonings with insets
of matching lace and outlined with tiny
pearls. Mrs. B, Koski’s gown of Ameri-
can Beauty crepe featured a slim-fitting
skirt and draped bodice with a high neck-
line yoked with medallions of turquoise
and crystals. Shoestring straps carried the
responsibility for Mrs. Garnet Carroll’s
black velvet boned bodice; the bouffant
skirt from the knees was of black gros-
grain, the large heavily-beaded flowers
on which were centred with silver sequins.
Mrs. Frank O’Collins set off her Titian
coloring with an emerald-green taffeta
draped and bustled gown.
The bodice of Mrs. Harold Holt's
bouffant black net gown had an off-the-
shoulder line ; a heavenly-blue tulle scarf
draping her shoulders. Mrs. W. Pultney
Mein chose a dove-grey crepe gown with
the neckline outlined in silver beads.
Small white silk tassels were sewn all over
the skirt of Mrs. C. Curtain’s white crepe
gown, which was highlighted with silver
bead embroideries. ■ Lady Dunstan wore
a gown and matching jacket of black
lacquered lace. Mrs. Samuel J. Fletcher
was in black lace and tulle allied to mush-
room-toned tulle. Mrs. Harold Rabling s
slim black crepe skirt had a cap-sleeved
bodice of jet-embroidered crepe. Mrs.
J. S, Disney wore with her gown of white
embossed velvet an unusual silver-and-
gold embroidered matching jacket. Mrs.
J. W. Ferguson was in white brocade.
Mrs. Sidney Baillieu Myer’s slim gown
of deep-violet satin had wide shoulder-
straps and bodice-top of shocking-pink
taffeta. With her were her son Ken and
his wife, whose full - skirted gown
of black marquisette was banded with
ecru lace. The off-the-shoulder bodice of
Mrs. M. Sallmann’s black velvet bodice
was heavily encrusted with pearls.
Tomorrow a Cafd Chantant, organised
to help the St. Hubert’s Boys’ Farm, will
be held at Hawthorn Town Hall from
10 a.m. till 10 p.m. Housewives can
stock up their larders from the stalls,
which will be set in the foyer, and with
afternoon tea there will be music
arranged by Mrs. J. Scarborough and
Winifred Lawson. At night there will
also be music, the items arranged by
Mrs. W. Howey and Frank Brookes. In-
cluded in the programme is an art show
which features exhibits from various
countries. Children may be left in the
care of workers who have organised a
nursery-kindergarten for the day. Mrs.
W. Agar, wife of Professor Agar, heads
the fcommittee, secretary is Mrs. H. G.
Connell and publicity is in the capable
hands of Ethel Seekamp.
Ripponlea, home of Mr. and Mrs. Tim
Jones, was massed with the flowers of
early winter for the dance given by Dr.
and Mrs. J, E. Shilliday for the coming-
of-age of their only child, Wanda. Now a
busy physiotherapist, Wanda is well
known at shows as a skilled horsewoman,
so her present from her parents couldn’t
have been a happier choice —an English
saddle. Mrs. Jones, with Dr. and Mrs.
Shilliday, received the guests in a silver
lame gown with a print of pink, green
and blue flowers. Mrs. Shilliday chose a
tailored gown of emerald-green crepe, the
skirt fully pleated, the collar and belt of
the bodice embroidered in copper-toned
beads. Wanda was attractively gowned
in white-and-silver embroidered mar-
quisette. Betty Jones’s gown of deep-
cream-tinted lace was worn over brown''
taffeta; her sister Pat wore a white fox
coat over her blue slipper-satin gown.
Young friends of Wanda included
Verna Linton, whose black velvet gown
featured a white pleated frill at the hem-
line ; with it she wore a short white-fox
bolero, Judy Bright’s choice was silver
lame. Kathleen Lucas adorned her
dusty-pink taffetas with antique amethyst
jewellery. Marjorie Langley’s black-lace
gown was worn over pink taffeta. Judy
Allen’s black-silk net gown had a yoke of
fine silver lace inset into the bodice.
Alison Walker’s pastel-blue crepe gown
had bands of silver headings sewn on the
bodice. Mrs. Jack Lynch chose a bouf-
fant gown of white lace with a belt and
cluster of emerald-green flowers at the
waist. Elsie McGrath took the eye in
garnet-red velvet. Gloria Ladd’s tailored
crepe frock was in duck-egg blue shade.
Pauline Priestley was graceful in black
laces. Mrs. Muriel Tompkins wore a
bouffant black-lace gown over pink taf-
feta. The black-lace gown worn by Mrs.
A. Silk, just back from the U.S.A., had
bands of soft rose-pink satin ribbon sewn
under the skirt from knee to hemline.
The gracious subject of this Athol
Shmith photo, is Mrs. Samuel J.
Fletcher, wife of the American Consul-
General. Before coming to Australia
Mrs, Fletcher, who is a native of New
England, U.S.A., travelled extensively in
countries where her husband was
stationed, including Peru, Havana and
India. Although Mrs. Fletcher has not
been in this city long she has already
made a host of friends.
With Mrs. Harold Rabling, Mrs.
Fletcher will receive the guests at the
Fourth of July ball. Among these will
be the Premier and Mrs. T. T. Hollway,
the Rt. Hon. R. G. Casey and Mrs, Casey,
and Sir John and Lady Latham —the
latter is chairman of the Children’s Hos-
pital auxiliaries, and it is to this institu-
tion that the proceeds of the ball will go.
Dr. and Mrs. L. Woofenden, of Florida,
have timed their visit to Melbourne so
that they can attend the ball and celebrate
the Fourth with their daughter, Mrs. A. J.
Davidson, who is chairman of the enter-
tainment committee. Mrs. V. Walker
Hoffmann, of Chicago, has also made a
special effort to arrive by air in time for
the ball. She will stay with her sister and
brother-in-law, Dr. and Mrs, Paddy
Moran,
Mrs. Wallace Mitchell invited guests
to lunch at the Australia to say “bon
voyage” to Vere Leslie, of Mildura, who,
with her mother, leaves in the Strathaird
for a 10-months trip abroad, Mrs. Wal-
lace Mitchell wore with her black suit a
royal-blue velvet flat beret. Among the
guests were Mrs. Eric Cottrell, her sister,
Mrs. Norman Spry, and Mrs. F. Key,
who has returned from England, where
she has been distributing thousands of
woollen garments from the people of this
city. Vere Leslie was at school with
Betty Wallace Mitchell, and hopes to
stay with her in Switzerland. Betty is
now sports mistress at a finishing school
in Switzerland, and is temporarily domi-
ciled in the home of an American Vice-
Consul and his wife.
Another hostess at the Australia was
Mrs. S. Aarons, who invited some of
her many friends who had birthdays in
June to lunch with her. Mrs. Aarons,
who is on many committees working for
children, was in black with a dyed-ermine
coat and large black hat. Guests included
Mrs. George Haines, who composed
amusing jingles for the birthday guests;
Mrs. B. J. Hattam and her daughter
-Eileen, Mrs. Gray Staley and Essie
Fraser.

THE SERVICE MAN
RED SHADOW IN BERLIN.
“Ek Dum”: The “statesmen”
who made the arrangements for
defeated Germany are now reap-
ing the harvest of their efforts.
It is almost inconceivable that
sane men should have agreed to
the present method of govern-
ment. The Russians have for
years been trumpeting their in-
tention of world revolution.
Stalin himself has said repeatedly
that Communism could not sur-
vive in the capitalist world,
which therefore must be liqui-
dated. At the very moment when
the Potsdam and Yalta agree-
ments were being framed his
lectures in 70 languages were
being circulated throughout the
world as a textbook of insurrec-
tion —the first Australian edition
of it was issued in 1943 at a
time when election candidates
were about to have their paper
ration cut to the bone. The
“Labor” Government provided
the paper to print it; the
“Worker” printed it, as it did
some other succeeding editions.
Yet the Russians were allowed a
foothold in the West.
Since then every Eastern
European country under Russia’s
shadow, with the exception of
two or three with stouter hearts
than usual, have succumbed to
Russian influence. And in Ger-
many, Austria and Czechoslo-
vakia there has never been any
Kremlin policy save one—a
policy of conquest through op-
portunity. No real attempt has
been made to halt their march.
A New Offensive
At the moment a new offen-
sive is in progress. It follows
the traditional technique. First
there is pressure. Then it is an-
nounced by the daily press,
under the inspiration of Mos-
cow, which always seems to be
able to publicise its illusions at
will through the capitalist press,
that Russia has again “failed” ;
that Stalin has fallen back be-
fore the determined opposition
of the Western Powers. Then
trouble starts somewhere else.
The pressure is on right
through Europe and Asia, and
it becomes more and more diffi-
cult to hope that the solution
will be a peaceful one.
What is happening is con-
temporaneous with the meeting
of the so-called Cominform in
Rumania, and the Council of
Eastern Foreign Ministers: in
Warsaw. The Cominform is,
possibly, attended by an Aus-
tralian representative—one went
abroad a few weeks ago.
Wherever he is now, he js
a young man who arrived back
in this country hot-foot from
Russia after the establishment
of the German-Russian agree-
ment in August, 1939. And his
coming and that of Mr. John
Fisher (now in Czechoslovakia,
having retired from the position
of press publicity officer to the
Australian Legation in Moscow)
was swiftly followed by the en-
largement of all Communist
newspapers in this country and
the universal changing of nearly
all their names in a single week.
He afterwards became one of the
darling debaters of the A.B.C.
and the adviser of Sunday
papers on international politics,
the ineffectiveness of the British
and the superlative virtue and
bravery of the Soviet regime.
With the meetings of the
Cominform and Foreign Minis-
ters there has come a switch in
propaganda methods in Mos-
cow, which, after advertising its
weakness and its need for peace,
has suddenly begun to flaunt its
strength and advertise the power
of its air force and the deadli-
ness of its new weapons. Also,
there has developed a new wave
of belligerence in Austria and
Germany, Reports both on the
Danube . and on the west
frontiers of Eastern Germany
are of armored forces moving
westward and of counter-mea-
sures by the Americans, who
now have a powerful naval
squadron in the Mediterranean
and a fairly substantial air force
in Western Europe, though far
from enough to meet the needs
of major operations.
The pretext of the currency
dispute has led to new restric-
tions in Berlin which have placed
the Governments of the Western
Powers operating in that city, in
which their authority is supposed
to be individually equal with
that of the Russians, virtually
in a state of siege.
The Russian representative
having rushed shouting from a
meeting of the Joint Command,
it became clear that that body
had virtually ceased to exist.
Then the Russians announced
that they would issue a currency
in their zone which would be
recognised for the whole of Ber-
lin, including the three zones
managed by the British, Ameri-
cans and French —this against
the majority decision of the
Allies in general. The British
showed themselves ready to
agree to any reasonable arrange-
ments for a single currency for
the four zones, but made it clear
that the U.S.S.R. would not be
allowed to dictate.
The Russians then began their
measures, which amount, in
effect, to the imposition of eco-
nomic sanctions against the Wes-
tern Powers and the deliberate
overthrow of the established
agreement that only the Joint
Command could issue regula-
tions for the whole of the city.
The old currencies were de-
clared by the Allies, except the
Russians, to be valid in the Wes-
tern zones despite the Russian
attempt to impose its own. Stern
rules were established to deal
with those who ignore the order
to recognise the standard Allied
moneys. Meanwhile protests by
meetings called by Germans
were broken up by mobs of
Communists who arrived in
Russian Army lorries.
Sokolovsky’s Order
The most serious implications
lay behind the move. It virtu-
ally amounted to a denunciation
by the Russians of the Allied
rights of government in Berlin.
Marshal Sokolovsky wrote:
These measures are necessary be-
cause Berlin lies in the Russian zone
of Germany and economically forms
part of it. A separate currency re-
form for Berlin is not practical. It
would isolate Berlin’s economy with
serious results. In future no other
currency will circulate in Berlin ex-
cept the currency of the Russian-
occupied zone.
The Russians are tactically at
a great advantage in carrying out
their surly measure, since the
Western Allies have been weak
enough to allow them to run the
railway and postal services for
Berlin in the interest of uni-
formity and because communica-
tion in and out of Berlin lies
through 100 miles of Russian-
controlled zone. The Soviet
authorities announced at once
that from June 25 nothing but
Russian currency would be ac-
cepted by these services.
The Warsaw Meeting
These moves appeared to em-
anate indirectly from the meet-
ings of Foreign Ministers of the
Russian group of Powers,
gathered at Warsaw on the anni-
versary of Germany’s invasion of
the U.S.S.R. in 1941 to receive
their orders from M. Molotov.
The Warsaw meeting has not,
however, been purely a Foreign
Ministerial conference. The
heads of armed forces and the
representatives of international
Communism were also present,
and the whole convention had
an ominous look.
With the virtual banning of
traffic between the Eastern and
Western zones in Berlin came
There , Admiral—you wont need your sextant now!”
rumors from Warsaw that the
U.S.S.R. and its satellites in-
tended to establish a Govern-
ment for Eastern Germany—a
serious move tantamount, in
view of Russian habits, to the
inclusion of Eastern Germany
among the satellite Powers and
the permanent cutting-off of the
food supplies of Western Ger-
many, which is largely sustained
by the East. A situation thus
has arisen which Mr. Ernest Bevin
described with nice moderation
as a “delicate state of affairs.”
Food and traffic with the West
were cut off. The siege of the
Western areas of Berlin, em-
bedded in Soviet Germany and
surrounded by Russian armed
forces, began. The British
Cabinet hurriedly met on the
night of June 25, sat till after
midnight and was called to-
gether for next day. Its mem-
bers did not leave London in
the week-end.
British troops were alerted and
sent to guard British material
which the Russians were trying
to cart away illegally. Russian
trains passed through the U.S.
zone loaded with armored-cars
and other military material. The
American sector was patrolled
by troops in jeeps armed with
machine-guns.
Marshal Sokolovsky issued an
order that the Four-Power kom-
mandatura had ceased to exist
in Berlin “to all intents and pur-
poses”—an action equivalent to
the ignominious kicking-out of
the Russians’ too-trusting allies.
He ordered that no more food
be sent into the Western zones,
which have a month’s supplies.
The British counter to this was
the stoppage of coal and steel
exports from their zone into the
German zone. Shiploads of
Australian wool are on the way
to Russia, with the blessing of
wharfies.
Western Inroads
The Warsaw Conference at
the same time issued a commu-
nique demanding a German
peace treaty providing for the
withdrawal of occupying forces
within one year, the complete
demilitarisation of Germany in
accordance with the Potsdam
Agreement—long a dead-letter,
since the Russians have repudi-
ated any part of it which they
have found inconvenient to their
plans—an arrangement for the
full payment of German repara-
tions (nearly all to Russia and
Russian satellite countries), and
finally, the establishment of four-
Power control of the Ruhr,
which would work out almost
exactly as four-Power control of
Berlin and Germany has
worked out and bring Russia
right to the French border.
An essential fact about this
plan is that it would also secure
the removal of British and
American troops from the Con-
tinent, leaving Russia as the
only strong military Power there.
What would ensue in the light
of the experience of the past
year is a foregone conclusion.
The Russian - controlled
nations at Warsaw issued their
opinion that the plans concerted
by the Western group of Powers
were designed to create a puppet
western Germany, closely bound
to British and American mono-
polies, which would be the in-
strument of American militarist
ambitions.
There appears to be more than
German politics under discus-
sion in Warsaw. There were
strong rumors on June 28 that
Russia was attempting to force
the Eastern European countriesi
into actual membership of the
U.S.S.R., that Yugoslavia was in
chaos and Tito missing.
A World Plan
There can be no doubt about
the arrogance of the Russian
attitude. The Kremlin will have
no compromise. And in Austria
fears have arisen, though masked
by the more open breach in Ber-
lin, that designs on that country
are taking shape and that, un-
less some drastic action is taken
to prevent it, Austria will shortly
share the fate of Czechoslovakia.
Shootings, kidnappings and
general lawlessness by Russian
forces are normal to life in
Vienna.
The Malayan and Burmese
terrorism, which has the bless-
ing of the Australian Com-
munist party and its subject
unions, is clearly connected with
what is happening in Europe.
British subjects are being mur-
dered, anti-Communists wiped
out by gangs. Both in Burma
and Malaya there is virtually a
state of war, implemented by the
elements for which the Sydney
press was demanding arms in
1942 so that they could display
their loyalty to British interests.
The Malayan area is a
strategic area from the Com-
munist point of view—an area
which produces the key supplies
of rubber for the Western allies,
plus tin and other rare' metals ;
a world crossroads through
which all the air and sea traffic
of the Orient and Southern Asia
is filtered. Its disruption is a
major task on which great effort
has been, and will continue to
be, spent.
Local Quislings
The London dock strike has
been denounced as a Communist
move and comes at a crucial
moment from a Communist
point of view ; and so does Aus-
tralia’s coal shortage.
Australians should ask them-
selves seriously whether the ele-
ments which have caused these
disturbances in public life
should continue to be tolerated,
especially since they are the same
elements which worked enthusi-
astically in various ports re-
cently to secure the quick dis-
patch of supplies which the
U.S.S.R. will use if need be for
military purposes.
It should be a condition that
with every shipment of goods to
Europe a few enthusiastic Com-
munist officials must be sent
for ballast, with an undertaking
from the Kremlin that it will
keep them.
Carl Jess.
Major-General Sir Carl Jess,
who died in a military hospital
in Melbourne a few days ago,
was one of those sterling officers
who made the First A.I.F. and
laid the foundations of the
Second A.I.F.
He was through World War
I from beginning to end. His
work was always constructive
and contributory to victory in
whatever operation he was con-
cerned. As Monash’s staff cap-
tain with the Fourth Brigade he
had a great share in the develop-
ment of that body, and he was
one of the main brains of what-
ever corner of the fighting he
happened to be in on Gallipoli—
from the reconnoitring of the
meeting-ground of the First and
Tenth Brigades in the first fate-
ful days of May, 1915, to the
hard hide-and-seek of German
Officers’ Trench in July with
“Pompey” Elliott, and after-
wards in the dangerous twilight
era of August. He saw France
through to the end, with grow-
ing responsibility and growing
usefulness until Mont St. Quen-
tin and the Hindenburg Line
operations with the Americans
on September 29, 1918.
Carl Jess, a Bendigonian,
started his military career in
the ranks of the Fifth Vic-
torian Rifles, and joined the
Permanent Staff as a ser-
geant-major in 1906. By 1911
he was a captain and brigade-
major. He had a battalion —the
Seventh —in 1916-17, and at 33
was given command of the 10th
Infantry Brigade—one of the
youngest brigadier-generals in
the British Empire Armies. An
organiser of unusual ability, he
was a natural choice for the job
of G.0.C., London H.Q., in the
homecoming period, and Direc-
tor-General of Demobilisation.
After the war he was succes-
sively State Commandant in
W.A. and Victoria, took a vaca-
tion from military life to or-
ganise the Victorian centenary
celebrations —he was knighted
afterwards —served as Adjutant-
General from 1934 to 1939, when
he became chairman of the De-
fence Department’s Manpower
Committee, a position in which
he did a fine job. He went on
the retired list in 1946. He was
one of Australia’s best Army his-
torians, and a competent water-
colorist. Behind a sometimes
brusque manner, he was a simple
soldier. Few at the hospital
where he died realised who he
was.

the A.J.C. with two requests—in-
creased riding fees and abolition of
the multi-strand type of starting bar-
rier. Pretty well every start made
from the barrier stalls at present used
is marred by horses breaking through,
and when that happens riders haven’t
1 a chance of avoiding a tangle with
the tapes. Mounted (spasmodically)
on Captivate in the first Highweight
at Randwick on Saturday, W. Cook
was dislodged four times before the
starter got ’em away. The American-
type stalls to be introduced shortly
by the S.T.C. may be the answer.
As it happened, Cook suffered in
vain, the race going to the Harinero
gelding Drummer Boy, with Johnny
Zero a very impressive third behind
Montrose; Tyndale (K. Barratt) won
the second division from Big Enough
and All Gold. Drummer Boy is
owned by one Herman Singer, who
was outed by the A.J.C. in connection
with the Huamight case. However,
prior to that, the horse had been
leased to trainer J. W. Cook; the
A.J.C. allows this arrangement to
stand, but confiscates the half-share,
which would go to Singer, of any
prize-money won by the horse. Pre-
sumably Drummer Boy’s nomination
is always received with enthusiasm.
In the Flying, Earl Pentheus was
well beaten by the very good grey
gelding Denali, with Homeleigh Dick
third; all three do most of their
galloping round Newcastle. The rider
of Earl Pentheus, apprentice N. Fox,
was reported as claiming that the
horse must have a phobia about
greys and refuses to pass them. That
should fetch a horse-laugh from
supporters of the animal, who have
seen him repeatedly beaten over the
past eight months by horses of every
hue; he has finished second at five
of his last six starts.
A solid favorite for the Belmore
Handicap (10f.), Avalanche, brought
by Cook into a handy position at the
turn, finished strongly to defeat the
three-year-olds Sovereign and Bolivia.
In the other distance event, an En-
courage of 12 furlongs, Katangai s
three-year-old brother, Yamboon (A.
Mulley), was an impressive winner,
lumping topweight of 9st; Bluesaic,
who has previously impressed with
his powerful finish front foe rear,
this time tried to lead all the way,
but was beaten a short neck.
J Thompson is in an unassailable
position for the jockeys’ premiership
with 55 winners to Cook s 40; on
Saturday Thompson rode in all eight
events and was only twice out ot
the money, landing a winner, two
seconds and three thirds. His win-
ner was Revenir, taking the Tarwyn
Park Handicap (7f.) for two : year-old
fillies; appropriately, Revenir was
bred at the stud after which the race
was named. Two divisions of a
Two-year-old Novice gave punter? a
bit of variety, the first going to the
50-to-l chance Cool Sir UN- Fox),
while the second was won by the
favorite Nessus (N. Sellwood).

In fine but wintry weather a goodly
crowd at Moonee Valley on Saturday
had their last chance to try to sort
out Grand National Hurdle prospects;
really, nothing outstanding has shown
up this year for either leg of the
big double.
In the Federal Hurdle the six-year-
old Solar Bear gelding The Feline
(E. Sellars) easily enough defeated
Sea Ruler, King’s Walk and others,
but he was a very tired horse at the
finish, the distance being but two
miles one furlong, compared to the
three miles of the National. Lugano
was favorite and an utter disappoint-
ment.
The Commonwealth Steeple pro-
duced casualties galore, only five ot
the nine starters completing the
course. None of the fancied Nationm
candidates appeared, and Salvo (C.
Bickham) proved the best of a poor
bunch. He was left in front when
Accelerate crashed five furlongs from
home, and at the finish had too
much in hand for Jevmgton, Garohl,
and a couple of other survivors.
Though the numerous South Aus-
tralian representatives can be relied
on to take a hand in the Nationals,
this page fancies for the double the
lightly-weighted pair Gordon Fox and
Bronze Laddie.
Half a dozen flat races served to
support the main business of the
day at the Valley. In the Keilor
Handicap (6f.) the three-year-old Hua
colt, and ex-Sydneyite, Sentiment ghve
further evidence that current Mel-
bourne form isn’t too hot. With
Badger aboard, Sentiment moved up
gradually to lead into the straight
and run out a clear winner from
“But I always break the strings of the other kind”
Lone Wind and Our Land. The
winner was equal-favorite; the place-
getters at fancy odds. Badger made
it a double when he landed Night
Fighter four lengths ahead of favorite
Sun Lyric in the first Ardoch Handi-
cap (Bf.). Euxine (Stan Martin) took
the second spasm of that event.
Rimfire (J. Gilmore), who earlier
this season was racing in Sydney with
widely-varied luck, proved too goo
for the stayers over the 13 fnrtongs
of the Mount Alexander Handicap.
Favorite Panmure made his run a
trifle early and was peggfed on the
post, while Westrahan galloper Royal
Pageant was a most promising third.
Those who had accepted the book-
makers’ offers to ‘‘take 6 to 4
about St. Rembrandt in the first
Piccaninny Handicap chewed their
fingernails to the bone during the
running of the race, but the Brueghel
gelding overcame an unfair share
misfortune and landed the Bacon. On
the other hand, Regular Port (E. John-
stone), strongly fancied for the
second leg of this two-year-old event,
gave backers hardly a moment
anxiety, Though he was very close
pressed at the finish by Port Line,
both being sons of Portofino.

Early upsets removed a couple of
the most likely contenders for the
Wimbledon tennis title this year.
Drobny went down to the Italian
Cucelli, subsequently beaten by _ the
English player Mottram. American
Frank Parker* seeded No. 1, was
gamely beaten by the Swede Ber-
selin, who meets Falkenburg (U.S.A.)
in the quarter-final. Falkenburg
earlier eliminated Australia’s Frank
Sedgman. Of Australian hopes,
Bromwich alone survived to the
quarter-finals.

The Australians in England:
After a draw in the return match
v. Yorkshire, highlights of which were
Brown’s knock of 113 and Toshacks
seven wickets for 81, the way was
clear for the second Test at Lord s.
Australia stuck to the XI that won
the first Test; England changed
Barnett, Hardstaff (a casualty) and
Young for Wright, Coxon and Dol-
won the toss (the first
time he has done so in a Test in
England), cogitated for quite a while
over the rain-softened pitch, and de-
cided to bat. A poor start saw Barnes
go for a duck and Bradman for a
patchy 38—both snapped up by the
alert Hutton at short leg. Morns
held the side together with an in-
valuable 105 until Hutton took
another catch in the same possie,
Morris’s fourth Test century. Hassett,
after using up more “Byes’’ than any
cat, got 47, Brown 24, Miller and
Johnson 4 apiege, and a day’s dreary
batting ended with seven wickets down
for 258. ~
On the morrow, the Roo s tan
thumped vigorously'as Tallon (a ster-
ling 53), Lindwall (15), Johnston (29),
and Toshack, of all people (20 n. 0.),
raised the tally to an even 350. Alec
Bedser (4 for 100) virtually was the
bowling attack. , ,
England came in and wilted before
a recuperated Lindwall; so far they ve
not had to face a combined attack
by Lindwall and Miller. Washbrook
(8), Edrich (5), Dollery (0) and Hut-
ton (20) were back in the pavilion
with only 46 on the board. Then
Compton (53) and Yardley (44) again
saved me side. Laker did better than
some of the pure batsmen with 28,
and the day closed with 207 up for
nine wickets —a cheerless effort on a
good wicket under perfect conditiipns.
On Saturday, Bedser (9) and Wright
(13 n. 0.) hung on for 25 minutes,
bringing the total to 215. Lindwall
had bowled 27 overs, including seven
maidens, for 70 runs and five wickets;
other wickets went to W. Johnston
(22-4-43-2) and lan Johnson (31-10-
68-3). Miller did not bowl.
With a lead of 135, the Australians
dug in stolidly, putting up 122 for
the first wicket when Morns (62)
was bowled by Wright. Barnes went
for 141, Bradman for 89 (again to
Bedser, caught Wright) and Hassett
for a blob. At stumps on the third
day, with Miller 22 and Bfown 7,
the total was 343 for four wickets,
the Australians sitting on top o’ the
world with a lead of 478, six wickets
in hand and two days to go.

The V.F.L. competition took a
holiday last Saturday while Victorian
teams played S.A. and N.S.W. At
Melbourne Cricket Ground about
40,000 saw Vic. beat S.A. by 13.18
to 13.11 after a breezy scramble in
the mud, and at Sydney Cricket
Ground the lighter N.S.W. team
opened with dazzling speed, slappea
on a three-goal lead in the second
quarter and then went, down to
weight and experience, beaten by
15.24 to 9.10. About 15,000 watched
it, a heavy outer and muddy centre
preventing spectacular play.

Rugby Union: Gordon beat Manly
11-8, with a disputed try (by Walker,
Manly, ruled no-try because of a
previous breach by colleague Clarne
Davis) adding controversial spice to
a hard, fast and interesting struggle.
In other games, Randwick beat
Eastern Suburbs 26-14; University
beat Eastwood 17-11; West beat
North 24-14, while St. George and
Parramatta finished level, 8-all.

The return meeting of Joe Louis
and Joe Walcott for the world title
provided what Amurrican promoters
described as a “box-office natural ;
a crowd of 42,667 paid £A263,000
to watch the scrap. Over the first
10 rounds, except when Louis was
down for a count of “one” in the
third, they had leisure to repent
the cash they’d parted with. Two
counter-punchers, watching and wait-
ing, provided a dreary spectacle.
Walcott retreated continuously, and
repeatedly Louis simply refused to
follow him. As often as he did,
however, Walcott got home again
and again with powerless but point-
building left jabs to the dial. Con-
tinuation of those tactics for the lull
15 rounds would have given Walcott
the fight on points, but towards the
finish of the 11th he made the fatal
error of hoeing into Louis —just what
Louis had been awaiting; in a
trice Walcott had stopped a flurry ot
punches and it was all over. After,
Louis said, simply, “It was my last
aBht ”. ...
To the dispassionate eye, former
Royal Marine Joe Upton (11.4)
seemed lucky to gam a draw in his
match with Rex Murphy (10. Hi) at
Leichhardt. Perpetual motion per-
sonified, Upton threw wild swings
from everywhere to anywhere, but,
fighting calmly, Murphy dealt out
terrific punishment as Upton kept
crowding to close quarters, and he
really won a one-sided points decision.
Moreover, a number of Upton’s wild
swings landed well below the line,
for which he was cautioned.


ABORIGINALITIES
“Hanko”: Old Ben was limping for-
lornly about in his roadside paddock
when we drew up. “A bloke can’t
stay about the house,” he told us, “Nag,
nag, nag every time she sees y’.” Asked
what ailed his leg, Ben said he’d “slipped
gittin’ out o’ the wagonette.” “O’ course,”
he said, “she will have it that I was
boozed when, as a matter of fact, I don’t
have many more than ten or so drinks all
day. But there ain’t a hope for y’ if y’re
known t’ like a quiet glass or two. If
y’ got struck be lightnin’ they’d say y’
was boozed an’ blundered into the flamin’
thing.” Along the road a bit we came
upon a wagonette with its two offside
wheels over a culvert and a patient horse
whickering a welcome to us. We levered
the vehicle on to an even keel, tied the
reins and sent old Nugget on his way.
* * * *
“Malta”: Fish turn up unexpectedly
on strange shores without apparent
reason. At Mallacoota Inlet (Vic.) this
year whiting were found in numbers
unknown before—two women hooked 441
there in a day—and the fish were thick
in all Victorian harbors around to Port
Phillip. Black bream, too, plentiful at
the Gippsland Lakes, made their first
appearance for decades at Corner Inlet
and also in Corio Bay. Flounder like-
wise this season afe in greater numbers.
The strangest migration, however,
occurred off the east coast of Tasmania a
month or so ago. While long-lining
there in 70 fathoms the crew of the
Pacific Pride caught 15 tons of strange
fish weighing 20 to 30 pounds. It took
Sydney ichthyologists to identify the
species as Hyperoglyphe mortoni, or
bream trevally. The only other 16 speci-
mens recorded were caught in 1913 by
the trawler Endeavour in The Bight and
also off Gabo, in 180 fathoms.
* * * *
“Bo”: Manton, who had bought
Thompson’s property out along the
Ridge, was telling Conyers he’d at last
managed to get a chap to fence the
southern boundary. “Bloke name o’
Matherson —they tell me he’s a good
worker, and pretty fast.” Conyers’s long
lugubrious face reflected no enthusiasm.
“Fair enough as fencers go these days, I
s’pose,” he said grudgingly. “But un-
reliable. He’ll tell y’ he’ll start on a
certain / day, but he mightn’t turn up till
about seven o’clock. Y’ can’t take his
word.” A week or so later Conyers met
Manton again. “I hear y’ still haven’t got
y’r fencin’ done,” he said. “No,” Manton
replied. “Didn’t y’ hear? Matherson’s
utility turned over on some loose stuff
near that nasty bend coming by Proctor’s
on his way out to start on the job. He’s
in hospital-—his leg’s broken in two
places.” Conyers shook his head
gloomily. “I told y’,” he said slowly,
“y’ couldn’t trust that cove to keep his
word.”
* * * *
“Salmon Gums”: “Macnell’s” reference
to “s'ea water reaching boiling lava in
the mountain’s bowels” (B. 26/5/’4B)
recalls that the old theory of an earth
with a molten centre has been superseded.
Scientists now believe that the earth’s core
is solid. On all the evidence it must be.
No known substance could possibly boil
at temperatures' less than solar under the
pressure to which the centre of the globe
is subjected. A substance boils when its
temperature is raised to a point where the
molecules can hurl themselves apart.
Water turning to steam is an example of
molecules throwing themselves off, as
steam, from the parent body. At ground-
level, under normal conditions, water
boils at lOOdeg. C. In a vacuum it boils
at little more than half that temperature,
and under a pressure of, say, three
atmospheres it remains calm at several
hundred degrees. The pressure exerted
'on the interior of the globe—that portion
“deeper” than the earth’s “crust” of
about 50 miles—is so great that at most
the substance of which it is composed
cannot, even at terrific temperatures, be
more than slightly plastic ; and as the
pressure increases towards: the centre, the
actual core must be far more solid than
anything we can conceive. It is when
some readjustment of pressure-tempera-
ture occurs —such as in an earthquake,
or fault—that the heated interior follows
its natural tendency to boil, and we have
an eruption such as 1 occurred when
Krakatoa hurled its dust .17 miles into the
air to provide two generations of South
Americans with the most gorgeous sunsets
the civilised world has seen.

“Eastern”: Before leaving town Bob
hurried into the store, where Ted Mathers
and family were making a few purchases
before they, too, turned homeward. Bob
shoved his account over the counter,
pointed out the error the store bloke had
made against himself, and paid the
difference. “Gripes, you’re a mug,”
Mathers hissed in his ear. “If you want
to get on nowadays, lad, remember to
think quick, consider yourself, and never
miss an opportunity.” Bob grinned good-
“Well, for crying out loud!”
naturedly, and departed. Nearing home
he was passing the Matherses’ place when
he spotted a bunch of his cows in his
neighbor’s garden, and pulled up. Rue-
fully he eyed the rows of stark cabbage-
stalks, the ruined beds of peas and car-
rots, and thought of the damages Mathers
would surely demand. “Think quick,”
Bob told himself with a grin, and running
his cows out, he hastily strained up the
broken fence. “An’ consider yourself,”
he added, with one eye on the town road.
He had the culprits out of sight up the
paddock when he noticed Mathers’s old
milker. Hopping the fence, he ran her
to the scene, shoved her into the devas-
tated garden, and slammed the gate.
“Yair, an’ never miss an opportunity,”
he concluded merrily, as he struck for
home.

“Hanko”: Harking back to the na|jve
blackfish. In my par. I said the blackie
did not thrive north of the Victorian
Divide, not that it did not exist north of
it. However, in reports from the new
Snob’s Creek hatchery it is stated that
“the southern blackfish will be bred,”
which seems to indicate that the ichthy-
ologists have an idea it is a distinct
species. Incidentally, the largest blackfish
I’ve seen was taken from the Barwon
(Vic.). It pulled the scales a tick over 51b.
That’s the way southern blackies come
to the pan.
* * * *
“Colonial Cove”: Tell “Kelms” (B.
26/5/’4B) that it was no misguided
pastoralist who inflicted Guildford
grass on W-A. In June, 1829,
the transport Parmelia arrived carry-
ing the Governor and his first
staff of officials, and the escort,
H.M.S. Sulphur. In March, 1830, Gov-
ernor Stirling, having the idea that trop-
ical plants should do well on the Swan
River, dispatched Robert Sholl, purser
of the Sulphur, in the Parmelia to Java.
Sholl returned with £l2O-worth of pur-
chases, many of them growing plants
earthed in big tubs. All unknown to
Stirling and his gardener-botanist Drum-
mond, this earth contained either the
seed of the grass or its bulbs. So this
hardy grass took root in Guildford,
Stirling’s garden estate, whence it spread
to its extent and became known as
Guildford grass. Apd it is not wholly
contemptible as a fodder. When young
it is tender and succulent; sheep eat it
with avidity. When mature it is too wiry
to be eaten but has developed an edible
bulb. Although bitter to the human
palate animals appear to like it. Have
watched circus elephants pulling up the
gras's on Perth Esplanade and practically
smacking their lips over the succulent
bulbs. More, in times of drought, with
all the landscape withered, many a flock
of sheep has found salvation through
these same bulbs. Digging with their
sharp fore-feet they will uncover and eat
the bulbs, even making improved con-
dition in the process.

“L. de F.”: Bees had built between
weatherboard and inner wood lining of a
farmhouse I visited ; an outsize colony
that had, been in fthe honey-and-wax
business for generations. The farmer
never interfered beyond screening
windows. Bedroom allotted to me was
on the bees’ side of the house. Though
the nights were frosty, with my bed
pushed against the outer wall it was as
good as central-heating, warmth from the
hive permeating the wall at about bed-
level. The humming of the bees near
my pillow provided a strange lullaby.
Bees don’t all go to bed at dark. When
honey has been coming in heavily during
the day there seem to be chores to do
which keep them working beyond union
hours.
* * * *
“Creole”: Enemies of the shark-catch-
ing fishermen are the sea-lice (or trail,
as they are known in Tasmania), which
clean up everything that’s left within
their reach overnight. Shark-lines are
found with only the bones and empty
skins of six-footers. Crayfish-pots are
also a lure ; the lice devour the meat if
there’s any chance at all of finding a
way inside the shell, leaving only the
crustacean’s overcoat. They’re probably
accountable for the strange fact‘of bodies
often not being found after a wreck,
although all sorts of ship’s stores may
have floated ashore. At night, which is
when they seem to operate in full force,
swarms of sea-lice may be seen just be-
neath the water. In appearance they’re
like miniature shrimps, about |in. long.
Recently a couple of Tasmanian fisher-
men whose boat had capsized managed to
reach shore in an exhausted condition ;
when found they were covered with sea-
lice, but fortunately had retained con-
sciousness and so had been able to pro-
tect themselves.
* * * He
“X.E.D.”; The long, skinny cove was
fencing on the rise, soaked to the hide
and unperturbed by the steady drizzle.
Sam, riding past, muffled to the eyebrows
in oilskins, chipped him. “Cnpes, it’s
a wonder y’ ain’t froze t’ the ground,”
he said. “Surely Corkran don’t expect
y’ t’ work in this weather.” “Aw, he
never told me not to,” replied the
fencer. “Well, if he was my boss I’d
tell him what t’ do with his job,” Sam
said. “Y’re a mug toilin’ f’r the likes
o’ him.” The fencer shivered. “He
pays good wages,” he defended. “An’
he’s well satisfied with me work. It’s
bin like this f’r the whole fortnight since
I started, icy-cold an’ rainin’ most o’ the
time. But that’s not Corkran’s fault. A
bloke that pays y’ well f’r a job where
y’ don’t git up a sweat is all right with
me.”

“B. A. Ker”: I was still cursing the
Shire Council for allowing such a road
to exist when a truck bearing the name
of the accursed pulled up. The bike,
with its buckled front wheel, thrown on
the back, I, somewhat mollified, climbed
in with the driver. We were driving
along in silence, the conversation having
exhausted itself, when a cry reached me
above the purr of the motor. Listening
intently I heard it again—a faint cry for
help. The driver seemed sceptical, but
pulled up. Together we listened. No-
thing broke the silence. Shaking his
head the council man started his engine.
Scarcely had we moved off before the
cry came again, faint with distance, but
unmistakably: “Help!” I clutched the
driver’s arm; there was a quizzical ex-
pression on his face and he seemed to
be smelling my breath as again he stopped
the truck. For, it seemed, fully five
minutes we waited. “Satisfied?” grinned
the other fellow, and shuffled the gear-
lever. A hundred yards passed. But
this time there could be no mistake —
and the cry was coming from the back
of the truck! Quickly I wriggled round
to look through the pane of glass. Ex-
cept for my wrecked bike the truck was
empty. Then, to my horror, the voice
screamed: “Stop, stop ; I’m caught under
the chassis! ” Even a man as deaf as the
driver could have heard that. “Aw,” he
shrugged, “must be one of them relief
workers I ran into back there. Anyhow,
it don’t matter much —there was plenty
of ’em.” I was just about to fly at him
—when I took a tumble. That happened
in ’32. I’d forgotten the incident until
I read “G.M.M.’s” claim (B. 9/6/’4B)
that ventriloquists get their illusions only
by pointing, stamping or such-like in the
direction from whence the voice is sup-
posed to come.

“Bosun’s Mate”: Sombre black-and-
white Admiralty Charts, which have
guided mariners for centuries, have been
given a new look. A year ago the Navy
Hydrographer produced two colored ex-
perimental charts to test sea opinion.
This is favorable, and now maps are to
be colored magenta, blue wash and pale
grey. Admiralty holds some 6000 copper
chart-plates, many of them over 100 years
old. One dating back to 1817 is still in
use. Plates are brought up to date con-
stantly by naval surveying-ships, and
last year 1,800,000 charts were sold to
mariners all over the world. Charts are
like novels —some popular, some shelf-
bound. Prices range from half-a-crown
to 10s. 6d.; last year’s Admiralty takings
were a record £200,000.

“Zake”: I have never struck a bush-
man yet who, taking his damper from
the coals, didn’t, after flicking the embers
from it, religiously stand it on its end
to cool. Perhaps a Councillor may
explain why a sod shouldn’t be slammed
on its side the while it sheds its fever. I’ve
never heard it argued that the standing-
on-end ritual assisted in its attaining a
feathery lightness.

“Esk D.”: The traveller, arriving at
Joe Sudds’s place on Kettle Creek, is
received with genuine hospitality. He
sells, when he can, sets of books on
veterinary science for a bare half-dozen
guineas a time; but those who farm at
“The Crick” aren’t enthusiastic about
modern stock ailments and have their
own simple cures for such known sick-
nesses as Dobbin or Strawb get stricken
with. Still, no matter for that, Joe escorts
the visitor over the decayed verandah
with the deference he’d show to royalty.
Inside the two-roomed shack —skillion on
the back—Mrs. Sudds lifts her flushed
face from the cooking on the stove to
welcome the guest and invite him to share
their meal. Mention of the word brings
a procession of heads through the back
door —seven —and the kids fine up to
the table. Stew, spuds and pumpkin,
fare of the cow-cockying belt, is served.
The traveller guesses the gravied con-
glomerate might be rabbit, hopes it’s not
kangaroo and finally compromises
(wrongly) with himself on mutton. He
is left badly in the scramble for the bread
and sticky onslaught on a large tin of
cocky’s joy. “Me an’ the missus believe
in doin’ ourselves well,” Joe remarks,
sipping stray drops of nectar from his
whiskers. “An’ our visitors, too. Y’
won’t find all the cockles like us. If
y’re goin’ up further to old Burton’s
place. I’ll warn y’ not to stop there f’r
a feed. They’re terrible rough-an’-ready
the way they dish up the tucker.”

“Gumsucker”: One of the disadvan-
tages of humping bluey—now fast be-
coming a past phase of Australian life —
was that while one could carry a blanket,
even two, it was impossible to carry a
mattress —and old Mother Earth, seldom
a soft couch, could at times be extremely
cold. Roll himself ever so snugly in
his blanket the under-the-sky sleeper
might shiver for hours until the cold
ground beneath warmed with the heat of
his own body, A mate and I, both on
our first tramp, had suffered this until
one evening we fell in with an old-timer.
“Come, I’ll show you a warm bed,” he
offered. Clo&'e handy was a paddock
wherein were a couple of dozen sleeping
cows. We picked on a group of four
lying in the meagre shelter of a rung tree.
“Rouse up, Strawberry,” commanded the
0.-t. “Now get your nap down where the
beefs have been lying and you’ll find the
ground real warm.” It certainly was a
bit hard on Strawb, but warm it was,
and so remained.
COCK ROBIN.
Snatch of a tale from the long brown river,
A fragment here that a drover said,
Forms a picture of bay Cock Robin,
Bay Cock Robin with tossing head.
Years have passed and the tales grown older,
Deathless legends' that travel far
Differ over the slope of shoulder,
The size, the shape of a forehead star.
Time from the keenest mind will sever
The minor detail, but all agree
He was as good as the long brown river
Bred in the last half-century.
Calm, they tell us, when combat started —
“Give him his head and he’d see you through.”
If a rein should break or the bridle parted
Bay Cock Robin knew what to do.
These men tell, with their slow words tracing
A chart of a far-back mustering,
Of a stockman stunned and a bay horse racing
Riderless past the spreading wing.
There was work undone and the old horse
knew it,
Here was the hour of urgent need,
And the mob swung back as he hurtled to it —
Bay Cock Robin had turned the lead.
Swiftly the life of horseflesh passes
And proud Cock Robin died years ago,
But a bay ghost gallops the tussock grasses
When grey men yarn where the campfires
glow.

“Gravelsnatcher”: A fight in which a
donkey killed his bulldog opponent by
removing a mouthful of his spinal cords
has amazed the dailies. It needn’t have.
There’s nothing more savage or cunning
than a fighting donkey, and a bulldog
isn’t in it with him for tenacity. He 11
never relinquish his grip once he’s got
what instinct tells him is a winning hold.
Once saw one handle a big stallion who
had challenged his right to live. The
donk. held the centr#of the ring, braying
defiance and sidestepping as the big
bloke rushed and kicked. When the
chance came he struck. His strong teeth
bit deep into the fetlock, and the stallion
screamed in agony as bones crushed and
sinews; severed. Time and again the big
chap struck at his foe’s withers, but in-
creased pressure from those unrelenting
jaws brought his head up in a paroxysm
of pain. Reinforcements summoned by
the stallion’s owner finally beat off the
donk., who watched from a short distance
while his! demented foe was dispatched
with a merciful bullet. I’ve never seen a
donkey that was a squib or one which
wouldn’t fight back ; and I’ve long held
the belief that the Biblical character who
achieved some success with Dr. Evatt’s
favorite weapon 'manoeuvred that jaw-
bone from a safe distance while it was
still attached to a belligerent donkey.

“Bardie”: Splinter called at Tommy
Benson’s on the way to the township.
“Hop in the car an’ we’ll take a run down
t’ the pub f’r a couple o’ jugs an’ a
yarn,” he invited. “I’d like to,” Tommy
said. “But I’m tied up with work f’r
t’day.” “Put it orf till t’morrer,” Splinter
advised boisterously. “Work’ll on’y kill
y’ in the end, so y’ might as well preserve
y’rself a day longer.” ■ “I’d be with y’
like a shot, Splinter, if things were
diff’rent,” Tommy mourned. “But” —
confidentially—“it’s the missus. She had
an attack o’ the shakes last night an’ didn't
feel too good this mornin’. It ain’t serious
enough f’r the doctor. Still, I reckon
she’ll be better f’r a spell t’day. I got
wood t’ chop, pigs t’ feed, corn t’ shell
f’r the chooks, fork a bit o’ hay t’ the
cows, set the rabbit-traps an’ about
twenty more jobs on me hands. Martha’s
havin’ the day orf. It makes y’ realise,
Splinter, the truth in that sayin’ that
wimmin’s work is never done.”
“Listen to the echo, Joe.”
“Lower Tops’l”: Melbourne and ports
from Cairns around to Bunbury are to
lose a familiar sight, that of the graceful-
lined, rakish-sparred schooner Huia. The
250-ton Maoriland vessel, the last in-
tercolonial sailer to cross squareyards
(they were removed in 1940) and a figure-
head, has carried explosives to and
about the Commonwealth for 33 years,
though it is over half a century since
the stout old hooker left the stocks. Age
has determined the Huia’s fate, and she
is to be replaced in August as an ex-
plosive-carrier by the motor-ship Bingera,
well known during the war as a training-
ship out of Flinders Naval Depot.
The little schooner often hit the news
for thrashing her way in winter gales
across the Tasman or The Bight. Twenty-
five years ago, when her kind were plenti-
ful, Huia was a crack little sailer. Among
her feats were the salving of the wreck
of the liner Elingamite on the Three
Kings in 1906, and her record passage
under sail during World War lof 4 \ days
from Sydney to Auckland. Huia has
been sold for £25,000 in Maoriland,
where she will freight timber.

“Conda”: Where the shallow bed of
the lagoon outside the reef broke off and
dropped deep to its grave we watched a
brilliantly blue Portuguese man-o’-war
hunting with its trailing fishing-lines.
Where every other invader of the long
tentacles was at once killed by their
powerful sting, three or four tiny fish,
about 4in. long, swam and rested un-
harmed in the streamer-like arms. Can
any blue-water naturalist explain their
immunity?

“Mat’s Mate”: Mat came down to
our camp from the township and said,
“Don’t start laughin’ till I finish, mate.
I’m up there battlin’ for a handout an’
draws a blank, so I make for the police-
station an’ give the copper’s wife a burl.
She says she wouldn’t give one of us
lazin’, loafin’ wasters anythin’. She says
it would be encouragin’ us to sponge on
everybody else, an’ why don’t we get
work. So I go up the town again an’
sight the copper an’ tells him we’re
camped down here. Then I haul off an’
crack him an’ hurry down t’ the camp.”
He started to laugh and I started to grab
our tilings and said, “Gripes, I don’t
reckon it’s anythin’ t’ laugh at.” “You
ain’t seen the funny side,” Mat said.
“How do y’ reckon that copper’s wife’ll
look when he lumbers me? It ain’t Court
day till Thursday an’ she’ll have t’ feed
me in the lock-up till then.” “Yair,” I
said, “that’s all right for you. What am
I goin’ t’ do, sit here an’ starve till y’
come out?” That stopped his grin.
“Gripes',” he said, “I never thought o’
that.” He was silent; then a thought hit
him. “It’s easy,” he said, “all y’ hafta
do is go up an’ stoush the copper an’
then she’ll hafta feed the pair of us.” I
never saw a man laugh so much.

“The Pirate”: Artificially-bred White
Leghorns have more nous than I gave
them credit for. I was helping a Kurra-
jong (N.S.W.) poultry-farmer clean out
a large fowl-pen. To let the 80 feathered
egg-laying machines out, two other lots
had to be released to let them through.
All the pens were alike, and the fowls
hadn’t been out for months, yet that
night the birds separated themselves and
all came back to their old roosts.
* * * *
“Old-timer”: Kelly, surveyor by pro-
fession and jester by inclination, blew
into St. Arnaud (Vic.) on holiday and
became interested in the old Lord Nelson
mine, the vast slag-heaps then decorating
the rim of the town an d the words of
sundry old-timers who alleged that not
only were the slag-heaps impregnated
with gold but that every gully around
the town yielded fair colors after heavy
rain. Kelly hadn’t the means of treating
the dumps, but he bought shovel and pan
and spent a week or so pottering round,
getting himself covered with clay and
seeming very intent and secretly excited.
The locals began to watch him closely,
and there were two or three prepared to
swear that he’d been seen carrying small
parcels into a bank and emerging there-
from with a gloating look. But nobody
knew where he was working. Then word
oot round that he’d deposited with the
bank a handful of nuggets, Kelly took on
a most secretive air and plans were made
to discover him. Three men trailed him
into the hills one day, watched him for
seven miles as he wandered apparently
aimlessly in a wide circle and bore back
towards the town. By dusk they had his
secret. Local gasmen were rooting up a
side-street, and after they knocked off
work Kelly hopped into the trench and
filled a gunny-bag with gravel, which
he lugged off into the scrub. Next
morning the whole street was pegged out,
“Had a bit of an accident , Doc.—can you fix me up?"
the mining warden was approving claims,
chaps were chucking jobs and buying
picks, backyards were being torn up.
Kelly vanished. No payable gold was
found. Kain, a publican, produced a
letter which ran, in part, “And the next
time some innocent bloke comes on holi-
day, think of Kelly before you start
filling him up with yarns about gold.”

“Betcha”; Stopped to thaw-out on a
rock in the sun, when there came a rustle
alongside, and a rabbit appeared. He
selected a smaller rock about 6ft. off,
perched himself on top, and proceeded
with his own thawing. “Not bad in the
sun, is it?” I remarked quietly, taking
care not to show any movement. He
blinked contentedly, and began to doze.
Pitching my voice low for a start, I con-
tinued talking to him in a gradual
crescendo till I reached loud-speaking
tones. Still he took no notice. A short
interval of silence, then I tried him with
a quiet “G’day.” Though softly spoken,
it broke on the* still air with a small
report, and brought his ears up instantly.
He peered in every direction, decided it
was a false alarm, and subsided once
more, to the accompaniment of my sing-
song monologue. At my first movement
he was gone like a flash. Have been
wondering since if there’s something in
the old saying “as deaf as a rabbit,” or
was the little grey cove I met an excep-
tion?
* * * ♦
“Solitude”: Not using sugar, the short-
age didn’t worry me, and I grew more
or less used to Seventyfiver growling his
way through every meal. Carefully the
old bloke reduced his ration into each
mug of tea, and .complained about the
local store. One night he experimented
with a spoonful of syrup and cursed the
Government, added a knifeful of jam,
and blackguarded everybody from the
canegrowers to old Blue. Next day he
drifted townward. “Got a pound,” he
announced on his return. “An’ George
says it’s got to do me a fortnight.” He
poured himself out a drink. “Saw Ted
Parfree in town,” he mentioned presently.
“Wants somebody that knows the short-
cut t’ drove his herd over Faintin’ Range.
Offered double pay, or y’ c’d name y’r
own price.” I looked up suspiciously.
“Well, you’re too busy,” I said emphati-
cally. “Anyway, you don’t want money.”
“No,” the old bloke agreed. “That's
what I told him.” Three days later he
walked in chuckling. “Had him worried,”
he remarked, “but he made it. Ted Par-
free,” he explained. “I’m taking his cattle
over*t’morrer.” “But, cripes, we’ve got
to bring the mob off Little Bally the day
after,” I protested. “It’ll mean a whop-
ping big day, and riding half the night.
What on earth are you doing it for?”
The old bloke grinned triumphantly.
“For eight rabbit-traps,” he chuckled,
“and six pounds of sugar.'”
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: That dockyard
crane at Garden Island with its 250-ton
load (B. 9/6/’4B) might have amazed
those ancient toilers who slaved when
Solomon built Baalbek as a stopping-
place for his caravans; but it wouldn't
have done the job they did. Four such
giants would have been required to raise
the 1000-ton rock girders that ropes and
levers and human sweat and blood placed
neatly and squarely atop the 70ft.-high
pillars of the temple of Jupiter. Imagina-
tion boggles at the task, and the death-
roll among the slaves must have been
terrific! It’s difficult to see why such
massive blocks were used—the genius of
such architecture must surely have been
capable of devising a readier method of
structure —but at least the builder knew
that his work would endure. When,
appalled at the depths of depravity to
which the priests of Baal had sunk, the
powers of the time ordered the city’s
destruction, the force entrusted with the
mission liquidated the population but
balked at the tasl# of razing the city.
The huge buildings became fortresses for
the Crusaders, who repaired and added
where the destroyers had breached the ,
walls. Those fortresses must have been
impregnable. Rocks Bft, high were
shaped to provide standing-room from
where an archer could shoot arrows
through a 2in.-wide aperture, while re-
maining unseen and secure. Somewhere
on the grassy slopes of Fiddlers’ Green, or
wherever the shades of departed archi-
tects forgather, an ancient builder must
have known keen satisfaction when two
warring sides, in what we call the Syrian
campaign, agreed to spare the ancient
structure the onslaught of modern wea-
pons. Fortunately, perhaps, the struc-
ture has not been raised which the in-
genuity of modern man cannot destroy.

“C.E.”: Ben was passing Sandy’s camp
when the old bloke spotted him. “You
goin’ into town, Ben?” he called. “Well,
wait till I clean up a bit an’ I’ll come
with y’. Want t’ see the bush nurse.” Ben
hitched his nag and waited while Sandy
poured out a dish of water and proceeded
to wash. “Rotten soap y’ get lately,”
growled the old bloke. “They been short
at the store, an’ reckon I’m lucky t’
get any at all, but I dunno.” “Yair, it
does seem sort o’ greasy,” agreed Ben,
taking in Sandy’s dial. “An’ it don’t seem
to lather much.” “Might be the weather;’
Sandy contributed, “or the water —it’s
pretty hard.” He grabbed for the towel,
leaving Ben idly investigating the soap.
Presently the visitor cut into the block
with the side of his tobacco-tin, sniffed it,
tasted a bit, and handed the cut piece
to Sandy. For a few seconds the old
bloke pondered, then comprehension
spread over his phiz. “Gripes,” he said,
“that’s what comes o’ callin’ in at Simp-
kins’s on me way back from the store.
I thought that dairy butter of Ma’s tasted
diff’rent this week! ”
* * * *
“E. 2”: Wallabies were raiding the row
of cabbages in the garden. “The rabbit-
traps,” shouted Dan. “I’ll fix ’em
There’s no use peggin’ the traps or tyin’
’em, ’cos from what I’ve seen the pests
alw’ys get away. A wallaby’s easy caught
with a trap on its foot, an’, what’s more,
there’s a couple of cowbells in the shed.
I’ll set two traps, wirin’ a bell t’ each.
That’s a good guide in runnin’ down a
wallaby, an’ he’s bound t’ scare his mates
away.” Sure enough, at 10 p.m. a din
broke out at the bottom of the garden.
Dan rushed outside, sooling the barking
dogs. Thump-jangle receded further
into the scrub. A dog found the other
trap and headed the same way. Bells
jangled in all directions and the dog’s
howls reached the octave above High C.
It took Dan two hours to set the hound
free, and the wallaby was last heard
jangling merrily on the downhill run a
mile away. He must have gone further,
for Charlie Pike was tipped off his hack
that night on the Dry Creek road in an
encounter with a shape that leaped over
the cutting jangling a bell. Dan says he
wallaby must have been caught by the
tail.
PROSPECTING.
On the hillside in the morning,
With the pick and dish and spade,
And the soft red loam beneath you
Half in sunlight, half in shade;
With the purple sarsaparilla
Climbing up the trunks of trees,
And the beauty of the wildflowers
Brushing up against your knees.
There, the peace that is about you,
Where the cool creek gently flows,
With the smell of sweet bush honey
On the wandering breeze that blows.
Oh! the smoke from gum-leaves burning
When you stoop to light the fire,
And the scented gums in glory—
Now, what more could man desire?
Sweet the loam you’ve just turned over,
Fine and earthy at your feet;
And a lizard’s come to watch you
As your bread and meat you eat:
Yon, among the dappled shadows,
With your back against a tree,
Drinking fragrant, hot and smoky
Pannikins of strong black tea.
VICTORIA.

"DON'T WORRY. I'M SENDING IT OT
GRAZCOS."
Sheep and Erosion.
“Betcha”: The inclination of
sheep is to avoid an up- or down-
route. Travelling round hillsides
they leave hollowed pads that
act as contour furrows in pre-
venting soil erosion. The trouble
comes in more confined areas,
such as clover paddocks on
gently rolling country, where the
woollies are piled on heavily. A
major point then is? the placing
of the gates. The gate is often
placed high on a rise at the back
of the paddock or at the foot of
the slope in a bottom corner.
Down the numerous pads con-
verging on the gap race the
storm-waters, taking topsoil and
leaving deep gutters. A gate on
a flat site is best, or, failing that,
one placed where the leading
pads will run across and not
with the slope.
Another unwise practice is the
marking of gateways with a
couple of shade trees. The
ground beneath them is soon
bare of grass, the hoofs of shel-
tering stock churn up the dust
and the breeze takes it off, leav-
ing a hollowed area round the
gateway. Result, a lake or bog in
winter and an exposed bed-log
or hole under the gate in sum-
mer. The site for the shade trees'
is further in the paddock, on a
sheltered slope, hr top of a
small knoll.
Buying a Cow.
“Mr.”: Where records aren’t
available the main points to look
for are capacity to gather food
and digest it and to carry a large
udder without discomfort. En-
larging on this in the N.S.W.
“Agricultural Gazette,” A. C.
Small, H.D.D., says that to
gather food a cow has to be
able to walk without effort. She
needs well-developed, strong legs
with no tendency to splay feet or
cow-hdcks (hocks too close to-
gether, pointing inwards instead
of slightly outwards, hind legs
sloping under the body, throwing
the weight of the hindquarters on
to the tender rear of the hoof).
The cow needs a broad muzzle
and wide bottom jaw fitting
squarely to the top Jaw if she’s
to gather sufficient food, a strong
digestion to deal with this food
—an outward indication of this
is a deep, well-formed barrel,
with ribs well-sprung and widely
separated. Capacity to digest
food is naturally influenced by
good health, and this is indi-
cated by alertness, activity, a full
bright eye and a moist muzzle,
elevated ears and a smooth,
glossy coat.
One of the main pointers to
udder carrying is length from
hip to pin-bone. In nine cows
out of 10 the udder ends at a
line drawn perpendicularly from
hip to ground, and, says Small,
the further forward the hip-joint
the greater the length of the
udder. Width of the udder is
governed by width of the body
in the hindquarters, so make
sure that in addition to her other
qualities the cow is wide across
the hips. See that she has flat
thighs and freedom from flesh
in the area surrounding the
escutcheon. If thighs are round
and hindquarters heavily fleshed,
she is utilising her food princi-
pally for meat development. A
low flank is Nature’s protective
curtain for the udder.
Banana-marketing.
“K.A.S.”: In some agricul-
tural pursuits there is a good
case to be made out for planning,
as the recent history of N.S.W.
banana industry shows.
In 1927-28 the industry was
almost entirely destroyed by
bunchy-top. As a result prices
leapt up, and when the disease
was checked there was a plant-
ing boom. In seven years the
acreage increased from 3300 to
22,300, the southern markets
were glutted, and the resulting
low returns forced many growers
to abandon plantations. By
1938 there were only 15,000
acres under bananas. The war
brought the boom of 1942-47,
and with prices averaging 40s. to
50s. a case there was another
planting orgy. Then in January,
1948, the market once more col-
lapsed, the case-price average
dropping to about 15s. Since
April there has been a recovery,
but due only to light winter
cutting. Nobody doubts what
will happen when the present
all-time record acreage of 30,000
comes into full production. It
will be 1935-38 all over again.
Unless something is done now
this coming summer will be a
grim one for hundreds of ex-
servicemen who have sunk their
deferred pay in bananas. Others,
longer established, may have
enough to tide them over.
The problem of the summer
glut in times of abnormal acre-
age extends to the whole year,
and in 1949, on present indica-
tions, even winter prices will be
poor. The need for- control is
imperative. That this is gener-
ally recognised among the
growers is proved by the fact
that lately several of their most
important district councils have
plumped for the imposition of
quota-systems. Other councils
are expected to follow their lead,
and the idea seems to find wide-
spread approval.
It is argued that if, in times
of heavy production, each
grower is limited to consigning
a stated number of cases per
acre per week, the southern mar-
kets ought not to receive more
than they can absorb. Statistics
indicate that these markets can
absorb up to 150,000 cases a
month before returns become un-
profitable. The whole prob-
lem, then, is to prevent more
than 150,000 casesi a month
from being marketed.
What is needed is a long-term,
long-range remedy that will en-
sure the grower a fair return,
over a considerable period—a
sort of Five-Year Plan, First
item would be to decrease the
present excessive acreage. This
could be done by* (1) cancella-
tion of pending planting permits
and prohibition of future ones
until further notice, and (2) by
the compulsory acquisition and
destruction of the poorest and
most-neglected plantations. A
decrease in acreage is absolutely
essential. Whether it is achieved
by the methods outlined above,
or by the old “survival of the
fittest” rule, an economic figure
shbuld be maintained by the
granting of planting permits only
with the strictest regard to the
rule of supply and demand.
Another matter worthy of at-
tention is the high retail price of
bananas, in scarcity or in
plenty. Cheaper bananas would
benefit both grower and con-
sumer.
Ail this could be achieved by
co-operation between Govern-
ment and grower —the same sort
of co-operation that reduced
“bunchy-top” from a menace to
an occasional nuisance. The
Government, with growers’ co-
operation, ought to regulate and
supervise the supply and market-
ing of bananas. Most growers
would prefer an assured case-
average of 255. to 30s. through-
out the year than to take their
chance on the open market.
Packing Eggs.
“Urana”: If you want top
price send them away in the best
possible condition. Don’t over-
load the gathering buckets,
especially if they are big ones.
The weight is likely to crack, if
not break, the eggs at the bot-
tom. These cracks may not be
noticeable, but will show up
plainly during testing. It is a
good idea to have some chaff or
bran at the bottom to act as a
buffer. When about to pack,
place a little padding at the bot-
tom of each filler to help pre-
vent jarring, and fill in any space
between the fillers and the side
of the case to keep the contents
firm. Woodwool or paper is
satisfactory. Place another layer
of packing on the top row of
eggs before fastening the lid. Be
sure that no eggs protrude above
the fillers or they will be broken
by the weight of the next lot.
Place large eggs at the corners.
Pack all eggs with the large
end upwards. This reduces
breakages, as the large end has
less resistance than the pointed
one. Market at least twice a
week and keep eggs in a cool
place in the meantime.
The carrier has the responsi-
bility of seeing that lorry loads
of eggs are not left standing in
the sun, or all the good work of
the producer may be undone. It
is advisable to find out just what
happens to your consignment be-
tween the farm and the depot or
station.
Engine Ignition.
“Radian”: It is imperative
that adjustments to ignition sys-
tems should be made in accord-
ance with makers’ specifications.
Breaker and plug-point settings
are most important and should
be checked by feeler gauge.
Don’t try to guess in thou-
sandths of inches.
Pitted breaker points should
be removed and refaced on a
fine oil-stone. The ideal point
surface is slightly convex, not
dead flat, A perfectly flat point
will pit and burn quicker than
one slightly high in the centre.
Undue burning of breaker
points, accompanied by a smoky
deposit, usually indicates a faulty
condenser, and until this unit is
“Make a good job of it, Miss—I Want to look nice
fr the log-chop competition .”
replaced point trouble will con-
tinue.
There are dozens of spark-
plugs on the market, each with
some special feature to suit heat,
speed, compression or other run-
ning condition of a certain en-
gine. When buying new plugs
check up on the manufacturer’s
chart and make certain which
particular type is correct for
your engine.
Shelter-belts.
“Nillumbik”: Planters of
shelter-belts and farm wood-
lots might profit from the lead
given by Victoria’s “Save' the
Forests” campaign in its tree-
planting scheme by which
soldier-settlers are given trees
free. The trees for distribution
comprise chiefly eucalypts
(mahogany, sugar-, bushy sugar-,
river red-, forest red-, spotted-
and blue-gums) with a few silky
oak, blackwood and sweet pittos-
porum thrown in. No cypress,
pines or other coniferous trees
are included. In recent years
in Victoria these have been
shunned like prickly-pear be-
cause of their fire potential.
Victoria’s western district learned
its lesson at terrific cost in the
1943 fires. Coniferous shelter-
belts once ignited by a grass fire
are destroyed beyond hope of
recovery, but the eucalypts,
except in extreme cases, will
recover.
Road Transport.
“Tamar”: In B. 19/5/’4B “Bill
Ding” mentions the great num-
bers of trucks with their three to
four tons of wheat in W.A.
With all respect this statement is
ridiculous, and gives a wrong
impression of the really great
quantities of wheat being shifted
by road transport. The majority
of trucks on this work are heavy
semi-trailers capable of carrying
15 to 20 tons, whilst the smallest
of the conventional types takes
in the vicinity of seven tons. If
it. was not for this method of
transport a good many W.A.
farmers would have been short
of superphosphate last year and
again this year, the Government
having paid a subsidy to road
transport in order to shift the
super, in time for cropping.
Care of Sheepskins.
“Horseless Horseman”: Too
often not enough care is taken
with skins from the killing pen,
yet it pays. If you haven’t a
skin-house, net off a corner pen
in the woolshed—for preference
net floor and a ceiling as well
and use Hin. netting—also block
up all holes to keep out rats.
Skins are best stretched on a
frame made of double 3in. by
lin. battens with an inch space

IN THE j
WIND?
FT Is a fact that sky-
scrapers are designed and built to
sway in a high wind. This is a
healthy sign—a demonstration of a
sound engineering principle. Absolute rigidity would be
the beginning of fracture. The limit of movement (sway
or bend) is well within that allowed for under the most
extreme and greater than normal possibilities.
Ronaldson-Tippelt Engines. (Diesel. Petrol and Petrol-
Kero.) too, are built with the capacity to withstand
abnormal strain and to take all known punishments.
This principle of "allowance" for more than ordinary
demands begins with pyrometric heat treatment of
alloy cast irons and special steels, follows through to
less than hairsbreadth tolerances in machining and
concludes with actual test runs on a testing stand before
delivery to purchaser.

To the many “FIRSTS” contributed to tractor design by
ALLIS CHALMERS are added two new outstanding
achievements —models HD.I9 and HD.S. Featuring the
revolutionary principle of Hydraulic Torque Converter
Drive, the HD. 19 is the world’s largest and most powerful
tractor—draw-bar pull exceeds 36,000 pounds!
The Torque Converter automatically balances speed with
load. Gear shifting is practically eliminated. There are
only TWO forward gear ratios—o-3 and 0-7 m.p.h.
Torque Converter makes this possible—automatically selects
the maximum speed at which load can be moved. It
protects tractor from destructive shock loads and makes the
HD.I9 one of the easiest of all tractors to operate.
The new model HD.S is a 37 H.P. 11,000-Ib. tractor the
smallest in the A.C. crawler range—and the most advanced
in its power class. Engineered completely new throughout, it
features big tractor design, balance and stamina with 2-cycle
diesel power featuring electric push-button starting.
As in all Allis Chalmers crawler models, truck wheels,
support rollers and idlers require greasing only once in 1,000
hours! ... _ , ' A
This is only the beginning! . . . Allis Chalmers has set its
sights high. Keep up with A.C. developments.

between them. Size of frame
varies according to locality and
sheep, but one sft. by 3ft. Sin.
(outside dimensions) we found
satisfactory on the Darling. On
each side bore -yin. holes every
2in. through both boards ; a few
are wanted on top.
To stretch a skin, pin the neck
to the top of the frame with
sharpened nails tied to the frame.
Then, without undue straining,
draw each shoulder to each side.
Next the tail is pinned to a batten
sliding in the bottom of frame,
the weight of which stretches the
pelt the required amount. Last
of all, pin the flaps and hind legs
to the side. To keep weevils
away paint on an arsenic pre-
paration while the skin is still
wet. (Sheep-dip is as good as
any, and a whitewash brush will
do.) Be sure to wash off blood-
stains from the wool as well as
the pelt with a bucket of water
and rag kept in the pen.
Lock the door with a padlock
and chain if only to keep kids
and dogs away from the arsenic.
Skins treated thus are properly
dried out of the sun, away from
the ravages of dogs and rats. To
a buyer they have the appear-
ance of being handled by a
butcher.
Calcium and Phosphorus.
“Myrrhee”: Both are essential
to growing animals, those carry-
ing their young or those produc-
ing milk. If young animals don’t
get sufficient calcium and phos-
phorus they will develop rickets.
Obvious signs of this are stiff-
ness, bent and swollen knees,
arched back. Mature animals
frequently exhibit a depraved
appetite, chewing bones, wood,
tins, etc., a habit which often
leads to botulism. Topdressing
of pastures with super, will help,
but won’t competely right a cal-
cium deficiency. It can be given
in the feed or as a lick. For
horses and cattle where pastures
are topdressed, and for sheep
under all conditions, use a lick
consisting of salt only, or salt
50-80 p.c. and lime 50-20 p.c.
Horses and cattle, where no top-
dressing is done, will benefit by
a lick made up of salt 50-80 p.c.,
lime 25-10 p.c. and bonemeal or
dicalcic phosphate 25-10 p.c.
“Trees of N.S.W.”
“C.S.”: The recently-published
second edition of The Trees
of New South Wales, by R.
H. Anderson, B.Sc.Agr., has
been thoroughly revised and
greatly enlarged. It contains
453 pages of descriptions, illus-
trations and identification-keys
to all trees found in N.S.W.
Trees are described and in-
dexed according to their species
and to the division of the State
in which they occur. A key map
is included. Full botanical de-
scriptions of all trees are given,
also particulars of uses and
special points of interest con-
cerning each tree. A complete
glossary is included.
The Trees of New South
Wales is a fine reference book.
Hints for the Farm.
“Myrr”: When using self-
feeders for lambing ewes, move
them to a different part of the
paddock each day. This’ll stop
the sheep standing about in the
same spot waiting for the feed
to be put out. Locate them well
away from the water so the
sheep will have to walk for a
drink. enough self-feeders
to stop overcrowding. Oats,
oaten chaff, good - quality
meadow-hay and lucerne-hay are
all suitable for ewes on a scanty
pasture.
“Urana”: Never let poddy
calves run in the same paddock
as a springing cow. Two
poddies one night sucked a
heifer a few days off calving.
When her calf was born the
necessary colostrum was not
there, and it died. The poddies
which had drunk it became sick,
one almost dying.
“Wilco”: Certain foods are
good for pigs when given in
moderation, but lose their value
when fed too generously. Pea-
nuts, for instance, are very fat-
tening, but the fat produced is
of a soft, oily nature and is dis-
liked by consumers. Pumpkins
are also helpful, though by no
means a balanced ration for pigs.
Their overuse may lead to a
characteristic odor, flavor and
color in the pork. Molasses is
another pork-spoiler when given
freely and constantly.,
“Radian”: Radiators that
seep at every joint and are
beyond normal repair can often
be rendered watertight by the
following treatment: Place
about a hatful of gum-leaves in
a sugar-bag and boil for several
hours in a kerosene-tin of water.
Remove the leaves and fill the
radiator with the solution.
Repeat the procedure every few
days. Green gum sawdust, fresh
from the saw, is effective if used
in the same manner.
“Sundowner”: An effective
counter to powdery mildew and
rusts in the flower-garden is a
spray of lime sulphur, 1 fl. oz.
to a gallon of water, plus col-
loidal sulphur, |oz. per gallon.
Shake sulphur bottle well before
using.
“Sarina”: A handy liquid
manure is made by soaking
freshly emptied fertiliser sacks
in a tub of water. If the solu-
tion is very cloudy after stand-
ing a while it is too strong, and
should be well diluted with water
before being used. To avoid in-
juring the plants, the liquid
manure should be given spar-
ingly only after the rows have
been watered. A liquid manure
containing nitrate of soda or
sulphate of ammonia is especi-
ally beneficial to greens, and
stimulates the plants more
quickly than a fertiliser top-
dressing.
“Nubis”: Failure of small
seeds to germinate is frequently
due fo ants, A brush or rag
dipped in kerosene and run
along the edge of the seed-boxes
will give 100 per cent, protection.
The same method can be applied
to seed-beds, but it is not so
effective unless the plots are
edged with wood, which retains
the kerosene. On unedged beds
I use sheep-dip powder, laying it
dry completely around the beds.
“M.”: This year in Victoria
the parasitic wasp, Aphelinus
mail, which usually keeps the
woolly aphis under control, suf-
fered from the weather, and the
aphis made rapid headway in
most apple districts. A red-oil
spray (one in 20) will keep the
trouble within manageable pro-
portions until the wasp regains
its former numbers. Owners of
a tree or- two can beat the pest
by painting the clusters with
methylated spirit.

Jottings of a “Labor”
Jaunter.
Monday : Arrived Croydon
airport after flight from Aus-
tralia mostly uneventful —only
involved in four fights on plane.
Dastardly slander by pilot try-
ing to get me in bad with Gov-
ernment —as if that were pos-
sible, over such a trifling thing!
Alleged I’d poured a bottle of
beer into flight-engineer’s pocket
while lighting cigarette in
atmosphere charged with
alcohol fumes. All hooey; I
know where to pour my
beer. Private-secretary, who’d
gone ahead, was there to escort
wife, self and family to Berke-
ley-Astoria. “Gold” suite re-
served for self and wife. Secy,
expressed diffidence about pay-
ing 45 guineas week for suite.
Told him to forget it —good old
taxpayers back home are paying
for it, not me. Two other suites
reserved for family. Secy., asst-
secy., typist, liaison officer,
assistant liaison ’ officer and
almoner have quarters in other
hotel. Instructed secy, to get
my official Buick, which I’d had
air-freighted across, and pick up
10 bags sugar, 16 cases butter
and four chests tea, also air-
freighted, with which to sup-
plement rations during two
months I am putting in here
while waiting for the one-
day conference of the Inter-
“Just as Well I learnt to ride a scooter when I Was a kid!”
national Socialist Defence
League at which I’m to represent
Government.
Tuesday : Hate these early
starts. Had to be up at 11 a.m.
to be in time to represent Gov-
ernment at opening of Test
match. Thought it my duty to
attend and familiarise myself
with all aspects of game’s ad-
ministration in case Caucus de-
cides to nationalise the sport at
some future time. Argument
with gatekeeper almost ended in
fight when he refused to let me
in on the nod and made fan-
tastic suggestion that I should
pay like anyone else. At night
came into dining-room from bar
to find fellow at next table
staring in fascinated way at my
wife dunking bread in her soup.
Was going to clout him, then
realised he probably hadn’t seen
it done for so long owing to
shortage of bread here.
Wednesday; Got into fight
with Bond-street tailor this
morning when he ridiculed my
insistence that spats were worn
with “tails.” Some of these
pommies think they know every-
thing! Have to get outfitted to
represent the Government with
suitable dignity at dogs, stadium,
speedway, wrestling and other
such functions. Have arranged
to be shown over brewery and
distillery to make myself
thoroughly acquainted with all
aspects of these important indus-
tries in case Caucus decides to
nationalise them back home.
Thursday: Wife insisted on
using Buick for West End shop-
ping expedition, so taxied to
Goodwood—charge to expense
account, of course. Determined
to incur this sacrifice of my valu-
able time so as to make myself
thoroughly acquainted with all
ramifications of the highly im-
portant racing industry in case
Caucus decides to create Gov-
erment Racing Commission to
absorb all private clubs. Flashed
gold pass as usual, but gate-
keeper refused to recognise it.
Demanded to see committeeman.
Had words with him when he
also refused. He threatened to
get his club to send a letter of
protest to our Prime Minister.
Never heard anything funnier.
Told him to go for his
life, it wouldn’t affect me in the
slightest. Incident brought vivid
realisation why snobbish, Im-
perialist England is so widely
hated.
Friday: Trying to get visa
to visit Russia. Will not only
please union leaders in my elec-
torate and ensure pre-selection
for vital, next year but will en-
able me to find out just what it
is in the Soviet system that
inspires Ernie Thornton and
the coalminers. Am in a
bit of a quandary as to whether
to accept invitation from Lord
FitzSnoot to spend week-end at
his country seat. Supporters in
local Labor Leagues might get
to hear of it and be hostile at
my hobnobbing with aris-
tocracy ; on other hand, Lord
FitzSnoot, as a Socialist peer,
may be permissible. Nearly
got into fight with fellow in bar
of Berkeley-Astoria who ques-
tioned my statement that had it
not been for the help she got
from Soviet Russia England
couldn’t have held out against
Hitler.
Saturday: Met Shinwell this
morning; he boasted nation-
alised railways had converted
profits into loss of over a million
since being taken over. Pride-
fully pointed out that with only
one-sixth of their population,
Australia’s aggregate loss on
State-owned railways was rarely
less than millions (plural). Never
realised what a grip class-con-
sciousness has on the English
until I attempted to get into
official enclosure at Wimbledon
for All-England finals. Refused
free entry, despite Parliamentary
gold pass and Australian flag
flying at nose of Buick. Things
like this make one ashamed of
being British.
Bo.
Problem in Division.
“Henry and Bertha separated as
they had agreed to: He tore down
his half of the house and carted
it away.”
—Sydney “Sunday Telegraph.”
Alas! Top often in our day
Young love is swiftly blighted
And married couples drift away
Ere scarce their troth is
plighted.
And so a world immune to
shocks
Gives partings small attention.
Yet here’s a case whose paradox
Deserves a passing mention.
For when he quit for peace of
mind
His choice of Eve’s fair
daughters
He left the better half behind,
Yet took a neat two quarters.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
The contributor placed first is paid
per line; all others per line.
Socialism
Communism and Socialism are synony-
mous. Both mean “State ownership of
the means of production, distribution and
exchange,” which is the avowed objective
of the Australian Labor party. That in
turn implies the elevation of the State
to the position of the one big employer,
and the degradation of the individual to
a role of servitude. It also implies the
growth of a new aristocracy of depart-
mental heads, serving under one General
Manager, who cannot be deposed, and in
whom the godlike powers of the omni-
potent State must be vested. So, in the
last resort, collectivism (be it called Com-
munism or Socialism) means the end of
democracy and of the freedom of the
individual.
The movement which Marx began over
a century ago eventually separated into
two factions. Although they still agree
as to their economic ends, they differ
on the means to attain them.
The fundamental difference between
the factions is that one is composed of
realists; the other of idealists. It is not
easy to judge which are the more danger-
ous. The realists are closely knit and
unified to the extent of following the
party line without question. The ideal-
istic faction has disintegrated into a host
of parties established in various coun-
tries, united only by their ultimate aims
and disagreeing among themselves on
almost everything else. They are, never-
theless, an invaluable aid to the realists’
faction, for their very idealism and
woolly-mindedness give them a chance of
success in freedom-loving countries,
where the frankly authoritarian Com-
munist branch of their movement would
never have a ghost of a chance —as, for
instance, in Britain in 1945.
' The strength of the idealistic branch,
in democratic countries, lies in the fact
that its adherents are, for the most part,
sincere victims of their own delusions.
They really believe that Socialism and
Democracy can march together; that a
completely socialised State, with a totally
planned economy, could be governed by
the people for the people, and that the
individual could still be granted personal
freedom within reasonable limits. The
Communists know better. As realists
they accept the secret police, the rele-
gation of the opposition to the concen-
tration camp and a hundred other abomi-
nations.
There have been only two large-scale
experiments in applied Marxism, the first
Russian, the second British. The former
has at least endured; the latter, still in
its initial stages, is gradually being
exposed as the most devastatingly
unsuccessful experiment in politico-
economic history. The reasons for “suc-
cess” in one; case and failure in the other
are obvious.
The Russians made no attempt to mix
Socialism with democratic freedom. The
British did, and are finding the mixture
impossible.
Russia in 1917, as the most backward
large nation in the world, was ripe for a
colossal economic development, given
anything resembling good management.
When a bunch of less inefficient
totalitarians took over from a bunch of
completely inefficient and corrupt totali-
tarians, industrial progress of some kind
and to some degree was inevitable. In
Britain, on the other hand, the manage-
ment of one of the most highly advanced
economies in the world was transferred
from a relatively efficient to a relatively
inefficient board of directors.
Russia had never known freedom;
what it had never had it never missed.
The British value their freedom almost
above everything. The realistic brand of
Socialism being out of the question, the
British Socialists had no option but to
try the idealistic brand, which from its
very nature must fail wherever and
whenever it is practised.
Britain was in the tightest of tight
spots when the war ended, but her people
are endowed with precisely the qualities
needed to get quickly out of the
worst economic jam, provided they are
given the opportunity and the incentive
to exercise them. Such opportunity and
incentive were denied them by their
temporary Socialist masters, who imagined
that “planning” and “pushing-around”
were an effective substitute for individual
initiative,
Britain can still stage a comeback, and
will do so, for the days of her experi-
ment in Socialism are numbered. She is
gaining her experience in the hard way,
and she will eventually profit from it.
Can the same be said of Australia, whose
post-war economic circumstances have
been so fortuitously favorable as to con-
ceal the effects of several years of quasi-
Socialist misrule?— Cy Cyclone (Vic.).
Cypress Pine <
Shortage of cypress-pine flooring is
adding to the worries and costs of house-
builders, and is a source of added revenue
to some traders. Compared to some
of these people, Shylock was a gentle-
man.
Not so long ago cypress was offered
to a builder who would “take a load of
hardwood as well.” The hardwood, on
delivery, proved to be offcuts, and dis-
cards fit for little more than fuel,
although charged for at top prices.
There are finer variations today.
Cypress is sometimes offered to builders
who will give the floor - laying
contract along with it. The catch comes
"George has been in another argument With his barber."
in the rates charged by the floor-layer
who must be using gold nails or some-
thing.
Of the commonly used timbers, hard-
wood —having many disadvantages, which
are outweighed by the fact that it is
readily obtainable—costs about 80s. per
100 super, feet; N.Z. rimu—an inferior
flooring— costs 915.; Oregon —when it
is available—costs 1735. List price of
cypress is 51s. 3d. per 100 super, feet.
All prices are subject to added cartage
costs.
One explanation of the shortage of
cypress is that, with the heavy demand on
railway-truck space for hauling the wheat
harvest to the ports, trucks for timber-
haulage . are not available. The State
Government’s tax of 3d. per ton per mile
on road-haulage is a deterrent to road-
hauliers, and the Government shows little
disposition to lift or temporarily suspend
the tax, no matter how urgently road-
transport facilities might be required.—
Jindivick (N.S.W.).
Recruiting
“Macnell” (B. 2/6/’4B) suggests recruit-
ing could be helped by an offer of “danger
money.” Certainly the present financial
inducements are mere cfiickenfeed to the
new aristocracy of youth, many of whom,
while still living with their parents, re-
ceive a wage sufficient to support a non-
existent wife and family.
Our young men no longer need to
dream dreams or see visions of the
Golden Age. They possess it in the living
present. With short hours, changes of
raiment for every sporting or social occa-
sion, motor-cycles, portable radios, exten-
sive holidays, unlimited dances and shows
and well-filled wallets, the advertised
“conditions” of the Army and Navy
leave them cold.
Patriotism? The word is not in their
bright lexicon, it is not mentioned in the
posters and it is taboo in the best union
and Government circles where the only
enemy officially recognised is the Boss.
If the voluntary system is to -succeed
by bribery alone, without any appeal to
sentiment, the price of national safety
will have to be raised far above the
value of the industrial pay envelope, with
privileges and amenities to match. Other-
wise we will have to add to our other
shortages a tragic shortage of trained
defenders if and when the cold war be-
comes overheated. — Howmuch (S.A.).
The New Idle Rich
With the introduction of unionism and
of legislation for improving the workers’
lot—-often by humane representatives of
the employer class —a new loafer has
appeared. Bludging on his mates, he ex-
pects a full share of the collective effort
while putting little into it. Logically,
such sabotage is anti-Com. and anti-
social. Many workers laud the extinc-
tion of a wealthy class which lived with-
out working, but they indulge in the very
same thing themselves. When there are
resultant shortages of goods they won’t
face the elementary fact that a people
cannot have more than it produces. The
honest worker receives less than his
deserts so that the slacker may receive
more than his.
The slacker is the “Commo”-agitator
type which had a counterpart in pre-
revolution Russia. With the overthrow
of the bosses many were shocked on find-
ing that the new power liquidated loafers,
kept willing workers’ noses to the grind-
stone for long hours and allowed no re-
tirement. He who does not work does
not eat. Several voyages to Russia made
that evident to me.
Communists aiming to socialise this
country are pointing a gun at them-
selves. In the “workers’ paradise” and
allied countries, one only profits from
hard work. The mere name of “worker”
is insufficient to qualify—it is necessary to
live up to the term in excess of 40 hours
per week.
Reds in Australia fail to see that they
are mere pawns in the Muscovite plot,
and that after overthrowing our present
way of life —supposing that possible—
they will be made to work, and hard, or
be liquidated, by their Russian “com-
rades.” — Tackline S. (N.S.W.).
Regional Development
Efforts of S.A. to develop further its
rich south-east region by establishing a
port between Beachport and Kingston,
coupled with the Victorian Government’s
plans to build Portland into a first-class
harbor, emphasise the need for an overall
national scheme to achieve both objects
at minimum public expense.
Although the S.A. Government has for
several years been trying to find the most
suitable point on its long south-east
coastline no conclusive decisions' have
been reached in a matter which is likely
to cost the Australian taxpayer more
than £1,500,000. Selections have wavered
between Robe, Cape Jaffa and Lacepede
Bay (Kingston).
Planning authorities have recognised
that for the most economic development,
the south-east of S.A. and western dis-
trict of Victoria are indivisible. Many
believe that Portland (Vic.) is the natural
outlet for the lower south-east, but as
State Governments handle these matters
purely on State lines, it seems that much
money will be put into constructing two
ports where one would do.
Were it possible to have regional de-
velopment of Australia, irrespective of
State boundaries, duplication and over-
lapping would be avoided and much
public money saved. — Plain Australian
(Vic.).
Carpenters
Judged by standards of 50 years ago,
present - day carpenters - and - joiners
couldn’t hold a candle as artisans to the
old-timers. Of course machinery and
improved building materials, such as ply-
'woods, asbestos sheets, etc., have been
partly responsible, but, all the same, the
old wood-butchers were real craftsmen,
and turned out work solely by hand
which the present-day 40-hour-week
“workers in precious woods” wouldn’t
know how to start.
In 1895 in the Public Works Depart-
ment I ripsawed cedar from planks 12ft.
long, 6ft. wide and Sin. thick (pit-
sawn flitches), moulded, #rabbeted and
assembled sash stuff for months
on end. Not a machine in the shop.
Bolection-moulded doors were made
from go to whoa, and when a plane was
not on hand to run certain moulds the
old-timers made a plane to do the job.
Nothing but Russian fish-glue was
deemed of any value ; cedar and selected
hardwood were about the only local
timbers used. Most popular were N.Z.
kauri, American redwood at 17s. a hun-
dred—Oregon was 155., pitch pine 18s.,
clear pine 18s. Queensland maple had
not then been heard of commercially,
but a small quantity of Maryborough
pine (not the stuff which passes for it to-
day) was used for drawing-boards, etc.
Weatherboards were of Baltic pine or
redwood.
Very few of the hardwoods used in
building today would have been used for
anything but firewood. Wages were Bs.
per day for topnotchers—it was 48 hours
a week, starting at 6.30 a.m., with break-
fast on the job. We kids had to push a
handcart laden with timber, tools, etc.,
for miles, and liked it, for a dollar a
week.
Low wages, yes, but we paid 4d. for
our breakfasts and lunches, travelled to
the city on workmen’s trams,at 6 a.m. for
Id. (18 tram-tickets for Is.), and a good
clobber cost 25 bob. —D. S, (N.S.W.).
Bans and Other Things
R. J. Browne (jnr.), Hill 60 Jersey
vStud, Yangan, Queensland, who visited
New Zealand last month, says that quite
a few breeders to whom he spoke men-
tioned various lines of blood they would
like to get from Australia. As breeders
in Australia are losing considerable busi-
ness from the ban on livestock imports
imposed by the N.Z. Government, he
suggests the breed societies should take
the matter up, get the co-operation of
N.Z. breeders, and make a determined
effort to have things rectified.
With a one-man foreign policy, Aus-
tralian industries are denied open dis-
cussions in Parliament on import and
export policies, but it is time such
questions as the ban on the export of
Merinos from Australia and the ban on
the import of cattle into New, Zealand
were debated and the views of the Par-
liament made known to all concerned.
—Agric (Q.).
Mr. Chifley
What a contrast Chifley’s character
presents to that of Canada’s “grand old
man” of politics, Sir John MacDonald.
Chifley seems to be obsessed by alleged
injustices suffered by the Australian
workers at the hands of the employers.
He even speaks of the illegal 1917 strike
in that light.
MacDonald, with far more reason,
could have taken a similar line.
His parents were among the many tenants
on the Duke of Sutherland’s Highland
estates, who suffered eviction in the in-
famous “clearances” carried out by a
number of Highland landowners in the
early nineteenth century —they wanted to
replace tenants with sheep. Like most of
their fellows the MacDonalds migrated
to Canada,
Far from letting his parents’ ex-
perience sear his mind and turn him
into a class-conscious radical, MacDonald
became leader of Canada’s Conservative
party, and was a staunch champion of the
British connection. Historicus

Villas v. Flats
“M.G.S.” (B. 16/6/’4B) deplores that
Melbourne, unlike Paris, has expanded
outward instead of upward—in other
words, that its population lives in little
suburban homes' instead of tall urban
blocks of flats.
I’ve lived in Paris. Its flats average-
five to six stories, and are very compact
and comfortable, but they have no gar-
dens. There’s the rub.
Every little suburban villa has its gar-
den, where dad, -after a week at the office,
can potter in the sunshine, where mum
can hang out the washing and where the
kids can play secure from the hazards of
the streets. A garden is more than a con- •
venience—it is freedom.
As to the inconvenience of living in an
outer suburb as against a block of flats
close to the office or factory, doesn’t
“M.G.S.” appreciate the benefit of get-
ting away into a different atmosphere at
the end of the day’s toil? ' What if a
couple of hours a day are “wasted” in
travelling? You can remedy that by im-
proving the transport system, not by
bringing people away from the little
house and garden into the murk and noise
of the ,city.— Hist (N.S.W.).

tractors help shift 3,000,000 yards of over-
burden to win 1,000,000 tons of coal!
■DOMINANT in the extracting of 333,400 tons of coal per year from
the Muswellbr. ok Open Cut Mine toils a fleet of "Caterpillar” D 8
Tractors and "Caterpillar” Earth-Moving Equipment, operated by Thiess
Bros. Pty. Ltd., one of the largest contracting Arms in the Southern
Hemisphere.
Working week after week, month after month, these "Caterpillar” Diesels
are mustered to maintain a regular output of over 2,000 tons of coal per
working day. This has entailed a shifting of 3,000,000 yards of overburden,
the hauling of huge Super Rippers and Scrapers employed over the flint-
like surfaces. Also the powering of tireless Front End Loaders and Dozers,
operating to win for the industries of Australia no less than 1,000,000 tons
of coal in less than 35 months.
Transporting the coal from the open cut to railhead calls for "Caterpillar”
No. 12 Diesel Motor Graders. These maintain existing roads, cut and grade
new areas as the work progresses, repair road damage caused by the wear
and tear of heavy machinery around the immediate approaches of the
mine and construct drainage ditches around the cut.
Here is still one more project of vital national importance demanding the
ru gg e( l construction, tireless energy, easy mobility and sustained power of
"Caterpillar” Diesel Tractors and "Caterpillar” Harth-Moving Equipment.
And Thiess Bros. Pty. Ltd. add their name to :be thousands of contractors
who, in every part of the world, have proved dhat "Caterpillar” Diesel
Tractors can "buy” themselves with fndU£V saved whilst giving that
dependable performance which keeps the contract always ahead of
schedule, no matter how immense the task, or how gruelling the terrain.
