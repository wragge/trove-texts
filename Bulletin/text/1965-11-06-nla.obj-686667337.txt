Who pulled the Reserve Bank job?
The “haul” included 1,000 desks . ..
2,500 chairs . . . 300 filing cabinets
. . . 40 safes . . . 200 storage units
. . . 700 individual “personnel car-
tons” . . . etc. . . . etc. . . .
ANSWER: Using as many as 70

a number of armed guards . . . and
all sorts of technical equipment . . .
IN 48 HOURS GRACE BROS. RE-
MOVALS PERFORMED ONE OF THE
BIGGEST OFFICE MOVES IN AUST-
RALIA. GRACE BROS. MOVED THE
RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA!
$400,000 (the bank thinks decimal)
worth of furniture and equipment
moved about three hundred yards.
That’s right. Just across the street.
It wasn’t easy; Grace Bros. Re-
movals will tell you that. But no
moving job is “easy.” Each job
requires careful thought, planning
and special equipment. If it’s a
really BIG job—across the street, or
across the world —call Grace Bros.
The Bank job included moving two
plastic coated “ears of wheat” that
had been used as models for bank
notes! Get the idea? Grace Bros,
don’t specialise in “big” jobs or
“small” jobs. They specialise in
moving! Why did we tell you about
the big job first? Everybody likes
to brag a little.

Since 1949, over 600 Snowy Mountains Land Rovers
For 16 years, the Snowy Mountains
Authority has been operating Land
Rovers under extreme conditions of
climate and terrain. In that time, over
600 vehicles have proved the value of
aluminium as a bodywork metal. One-
third the weight of steel (but of equal
strength), aluminium absorbs greater
impact loads, and has amazing cor-
rosion resistance.
That’s why the Snowy Mountains
Authority has always used Land
Rovers with aluminium bodies. Even
in the most rugged and exacting con-
ditions, aluminium won’t rot, rust or
corrode. It reduces maintenance almost
to nothing. And, being light, it results
in lower fuel consumption, greater pay-
load profit.
Of course, there’s more to achievement
than aluminium alone. Achievement
also means Australuco’s years of ex-
perience in research, testing, design,
metallurgical improvements . . . years
of practical application which can be
summed up in two words: know-how.
Australuco’s engineers and technicians,
backed by the world-wide experience
and knowledge of the Alcan Group,
are able to supply the latest informa-
tion about the many applications of
aluminium in all phases of Australian
industry.

What's all the shouting about...
MAGNETIC
LEDGER
CARD!!!
HI
t
The fuss some people make, you’d think it
was new. Well it may be to some, but
ifiagnetic ledger cards have been a proven
technique for years at NCR . . . and they’re
now doing an excellent job for thousands
of satisfied customers.
NCR pioneered and installed the first mag-
netic ledger machines in 1957, and since
then has produced over 1,300 million mag-
netic ledger cards. The concept of magnetic
ledgers enables you to use electronic tech-
niques to speed up and simplify office work,
while retaining traditional hard-copy
records for immediate visual reference and'
•action. You can read the figures printed
on the front of the card . . . NCR Account-
ing Machines and Computers automatically
read the data encoded and stored in mag-
netic memories on the back of the card.
Magnetic ledgers mean the end of errors
in account selection and balance pick-up
. . . they mean neater records because the
machine controls form-alignment and
spacing . . . they speed up work by elimi-
nating time-wasting tasks which have to be
done manually on conventional machines.
For more information about NCR Magnetic
Ledgers call your local NCR office or write
to NCR, 14-16 York St., Sydney.

National Notebook
Sydney s Shims
The fuss following the showing of the
ABC’s documentary on Sydney
slums, “Living on the Fringe”, and the
announcement that it would be entered
for the Italia Prize, is a good deal more
interesting and dramatic than our tele-
vision critic, Dale Miller, found the
documentary.
It didn’t take long after Alderman
Con Wallace’s protests that the film
was a “shocking mistreatment of life in
Sydney” and should be “impounded” for
the Rev. Alan Walker to jump in and
point out that the thing for the Sydney
City Council to do was not to get rid of
the film but the slums.
The film, and more particularly the
Councillor’s agitation, have pointed up
several things. The first is that there
are indeed slums in Sydney.
The second is that nowadays you
don’t have to be a powerful politician
or primate to try to gag the ABC. It
was all the more encouraging therefore
that for once the ABC not only refused
to give aldermen a “private screening”,
but put the program on again.
The third point is one which our man
in films, Charles Higham, has made:
Australia will never get a film industry
while our films for export are tied even
remotely either to tourist promotion or
the Department of Immigration.
After the war, Italy made realistic
films like “Bicycle Thieves”. These
showed very definitely that Italy has
conditions of extreme poverty. How-
ever, they also showed what a vivid and
interesting country it was. Out of them
Italy got a major film industry and a
thriving tourist industry.
However, we continue to try to
impose our limited ideas of the Good
Life on possible tourists and migrants,
with Commonwealth film units churning
out endless documentaries of clean, well-
paid, well-fed people living in unsqualid
Ugliness. We have convinced most people
that we have a high standard of living.
We have also convinced them that Aus-
tralia is stupefyingly dull.
Tanner
r T'HE Bulletin’s cartoonist, Mr
■*- Leslie Tanner, has won the
Waikley Award for the best cartoon of
the year. The cartoon reprinted at right
appeared originally on November 14,
1964, on the eve of the announcement
of compulsory national training, when,
Mr Tanner points out, everyone was
talking about whether there should be a
call-up but nobody seemed to be taking
into account the commitments Australia
had already made. It is Tanner’s second
Waikley Award.
Changing Times
A lthough Bob Dylan claims the
times are changing, he could be
wrong about the direction they’re taking.
A student in Government at Sydney
University was stumped by a puzzle
which involved making three triangles
from five matches and finally took a bet
on it. Stakes were settled, after much
wrangling, at two shares in a public com-
pany. In our day a schooner was the
usual prize. However, finally the student
lost his bet and contracts were duly
drawn up for scrip exchange.
That One Day Of The Year
A ustralia’s most sacred day has now
** been declared and established
beyond dispute, and patriotism stands
revealed as a stronger force than
religion.
Under the new liquor legislation pro-
posed by the Victorian Government
licensed restaurants will be able to serve
liquor on Good Fridays from noon
until 2.30 p.m., and then, after a decent
pause for the death of Christ, from
6 p.m. until 10 p.m.
If non-returned servicemen really
must drink on Anzac Days they will be
allowed a glass between the hours of
12 noon and 1 p.m. only.
" That's Carmichael our commitment to Malaysia, Shadbolt our commit-
ment to Borneo, O'Toole our commitment to Vietnam and Cribble our defence
of the mainland."
Horne As Novelist
Horne’s first novel, “The
Permit”, will be published on
November 8. Somewhat post-Waugh in
style, it covers aspects of political, Press
and public-service life in the lucky
country. “The Permit” will appear in
paperback at 6s. 6d.
“The Permit” is the first title of Sun
Books. This is the publishing company
formed by poet and critic, Geoffrey
Dutton, of Adelaide, and Brian Stonier,
publisher, of Melbourne, with bookseller
Max Harris as publishing adviser. Dut-
ton and Stonier saw “The Lucky Coun-
try” through for Penguin last year.
Sun Books plan to issue only paper-
backs, but say they “don’t intend to
follow wearily in the tracks of the hard-
backs”. Reprints in their first batch
include H. H. Richardson’s “Maurice
Guest” and Judah Waten’s “Alien Son”.

jVo Fool He
English actor David Kossoff appar-
ently intends heading for Mr
Rylah’s Victoria after he has finished
his one-man show at the Festival of
Perth in the New Year.
In a letter to the organisers he assures
them: “None of my material is ‘sick’; of
great age, yes, but healthy. No four-letter
words are used, I remain fully clothed
throughout, and no Ministers of the
Government are mentioned. No jokes
are made about Mavis Bramston.
“I have no fellow actors on stage to
beat up. give drugs to, betray, or discuss
sex hab . with. No dirty songs are sung
and nearly everything said has only one
meaning. No decor is simple. No kitchen
sinks, unmade beds or lavatories are seen.
“Lastly, I would say that the produc-
tion is in the old way, in that the audi-
ence sit in front of me, not all round
me. I’m no fool.”
True To Label
j“\TS7E have to refute the process of
’ » labelling people,” Victorian Labor
MP, Dr J. F. Cairns, last week told a
rally in Sydney to protest against inter-
vention in Vietnam, and, without taking
breath, went on to label anti-Commun-
ism a “negative, potentially Fascist move-
ment.”
Paper War
Oroken Hill has just been through
■ an episode reminiscent of Horatio
Alger at his best. The city’s evening
jnewsboys stood on their sturdy legs,
fought the boss for a pay rise and won.
The trouble started when the price of
[the “Barrier Miner” went up from 5d.
to 6d. The boys, who sell the paper in
|the streets, found they were down more
than £1 a week because of the loss of
I the usual penny tip on 5d. sales.
They fronted the boss and demanded
a higher commission. Earlier, when the
newspaper price rose, they received a
20 per cent increase — from 5d. to 6d.
a dozen. Now they wanted 9d. They
were promptly refused. The boys, all
aged 14, collected their papers from the
distribution centre, went to the front
of the newspaper office, dropped their
bundles and sat on them. No amount of
pleading by the selling agent could shift
them.
In round-table negotiations later in the
Trades Hall the boys outsmarted the
bosses with their bargaining prowess and
overall knowledge of the newspaper-sell-
ing business. They came prepared with
facts and figures, and even had data on
the possible effects of decimal currency.
For two days no copies of the “Barrier
Miner” were sold in the streets. Circula-
tion dropped accordingly. The Chamber
of Commerce offered to mediate. Though
the boys were not members of a union,
officials at the Trades Hall gave them
unofficial backing.
On the third evening they had won.
Their commission was raised to Bd.
a further 40 per cent rise. But the boys
said they were accepting it only on the
condition that negotiations continued on
their claim for a guaranteed minimum
rate.
A veteran trade union leader remarked
afterwards that he hadn’t known such
a militant spirit in Broken Hill for 20
years. “These boys will make either good
unionists or astute members of the
Chamber of Commerce,” he said.
Victorian Hangover
HPhings may be getting a little more
liberal in Victoria but social life is
still far from free and easy.
Wine Week has just ended. The big
event was the annual banquet. The
sexes met for a pre-dinner sherry, then
were firmly separated for dinner which
one wine industry man described as a
“real hangover from Victorian days’*.
The Governor, Sir Rohan Delacombe,
presided at the men’s dinner table and
Lady Delacombe at the women’s.
On the heels of Wine Week came the
invitations to the annual banquet of the
Lord Mayor of Melbourne, “tradition-
ally” an all-male affair.
One of Melbourne’s women Mayors,
Dr Florence Peel, of Fitzroy, said she
did not think the banquet was a place for
women. Last year she sent her husband,
also a Fitzroy councillor, along as a
stand-in.
Dr Janet Cooper, Mayor of South
Melbourne, was rather more chagrined,
especially as the invitation from the Lord
Mayor (Cr lan Beaurepaire) specifically
asked her to nominate a representative.
She will send her town clerk.
Dr Cooper suggested, fairly mildly,
that Cr Beaurepaire might have done
much for his popularity if he had invited
her. Instead she will dine with the Lady
Mayoress and other wives while the men
are, presumably, carousing downstairs in
another part of the Town Hall.
Local feminists were more vehement
in their protests than Dr Cooper.
“Is she too good for them (is their
conversation really so impure?)?” asked
one, “or is she too bad for them (are
they really superior beings?), or could it
be that she is only too different from
them?”
Another asked was the Lord Mayor’s
dinner “a drunken binge with dirty stor-
ies not fit for the fair sex”, and added
that, if so, the sooner the tone was rais-
ed the better.
Commissioned titles include “Australia
and the Monarchy”, in which, according
to the publishers, “a group of well-known
Australian specialists examine the myth
and the facts of monarchy in Australian
life”.
. incidentally, when a second edition
of “The Lucky Country” appears next
month it will bring the print figure to
100,000.
STRUCK OFF THE ROLLS
80 Years Ago: October 31, 1885
TAISHONEST lawyers are not treated like
other people in the Australian courts.
At Burra, S.A., the other day. some of
them who had been accused of default
in paying over clients' money "consented
to be struck oft the rolls unless they
settled the matter within 21 days". "Con-
sented" indeed! How obliging the lawyers
have become! Of course this convenient
little arrangement amounted to nothing
but compounding a felony, which
offence, when committed by any man
other than a Judge, is a misdemeanor
punishable by no end of gaol. The other
day, in Australia, a number of unfortunate
people were "struck" by a rascally
attorney for a sum total of trust-funds
variously estimated between £50,000 and
£lOO,OOO. When next some poor devil of
a clerk is put behind the spikes at the
New Guinea Supreme Court, and fero-
ciously summed up against by the up-
right Judge, we shan't be surprised if
the jury return to court after a short
consultation and say through their fore-
man: "Yer Honor, look here. The fellow
in the dock only stole £2, and would
have returned it had his horse not fallen
in the Caulfield Cup. I backed the very
same moke myself. Now, if the prisoner
were a lawyer he could steal any
amount of money without being sent to
gaol. We're not going to put a layman
in gaol for a crime that could be com-
mitted with impunity by a lawyer. So,
though the evidence against him is con-
clusive, we have very much pleasure in
finding him not guilty." We hope to see
people up North take this hint.

"isn't it about time he was shown some modern discoveries like the wheel?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
“The Bulletin” and the Giggling Politicians
SIR. I have the highest regard for your journal
and for the magnificent standard of responsibility
and authoritativeness which characterises most of
your articles.
Imagine my dismay, therefore, when I read an
article by one Alan Reid in this week's Bulletin
entitled “The Giggling Liberals” and sub-headed
“Physician, cure thyself
This article completely misrepresents the situation
and 1 strongly deprecate the inference which must
be made when one correlates the sub-heading with
the use of my name in the article, namely that 1
am an irresponsible and flippant Member of Parlia-
ment. I have too high regard for the institution to
take it other than seriously. As a Liberal, too, I
resent this misrepresentation of my colleagues as
being other than conscientious and seriously minded.
Mr Reid is not so much in the Press galleries of
late, and I do not recall his being present on this
occasion. In point of fact, my colleagues and 1
were deeply disturbed that Labor Party members,
having first opposed the sending of troops to Viet-
nam, were now endeavoring to create the impression
that we are neglecting them.
My feelings were certainly those of indignation
and I know that all of my colleagues take this matter
most seriously. 1 know too that Mr Gibson felt as
I did when he launched his single interjection. 1
was shocked to the core by the tirade which this
interjection provoked.
Mr Reid concludes his present article: “Both
sides . . . might well take a look at who really does
the most damage to the prestige and public image
of the Parliament.”
1 believe that most of the damage is done by
irresponsible journalism.
WYLIE GIBBS
Member for Bowman
Parliament of Australia,
House of Representatives.
TThe current crisis in Australian Par-
l liamentary politics is compounded
jof three elements. The first two are the
Government smug and increasingly
[illiberal —and the Opposition—weak
jand so divided that it is useless as a
•critic of the Government. The third
is the Liberal backbench to which we
have to look for serious criticism of
the Government but which too
often partly as a result of
the Government’s contempt
ifor it behaves so irrespon-
sibly that it simply deepens
(the crisis.
I It was this situation that
Alan Reid described in his
report from Canberra in last
week’s Bulletin. The story
was headed “The Giggling
Liberals” and subheaded
(“Physician, cure thyself”.
Reid reported how a Labor
(member, L. Reynolds, was
'trying to deal seriously, in the
l House of Representatives,
'with the important and con-
jtroversial question of ameni-
ties for Australian soldiers
'fighting, being wounded and
sometimes dying in Vietnam.
Government backbenchers,
'according to Reid, “giggled
like flirtatious schoolgirls”,
which in due course provoked
bitter exchanges leading to the
ejection of one Labor mem-
ber and an apology from an-
other. (Reid did not condemn
the whole Government back-
bench; he made it clear, for
example, that, while he dis-
agreed with Mr John Jess’s
views, he recognised that he
took the debate seriously.)
The incident, according to
Reid, showed why Parliament
is losing its public reputation;
it also symbolises the crisis of
Parliamentary politics where
a grave matter apparently can-
not be discussed seriously.
The report has provoked one
Liberal backbencher, Dr Wylie Gibbs,
to write a complaint to The Bul-
letin which is published on this
page. Dr Gibbs’ allegations are of
an extremely serious kind. He implies
that Reid has been guilty of unpro-
fessional conduct and The Bulletin
of irresponsibility by attempting to
damage the most important institution
in the country. As to the first the
suggestion that Reid was not present
in the House of Representatives
during the debate which he reported,
The Bulletin can assure Dr Gibbs
that Reid was in the House of Rep-
resentatives on October 20 from 11.02
p.m., when Mr Reynolds began to
debate, until 11.49 p.m. when the
House rose. Further, he was in his
usual position in the Press gallery
over the Speaker’s chair. He was also
seen there by some of Dr Gibbs’ col-
leagues, whom Reid informed of his
reaction to the debate when they
stopped him in the lobby after the
House rose.
As for the charge of “irresponsible
journalism” by The Bulletin in
publishing the report: The Bulletin
believed, and believes, that Alan
Reid’s report was accurate and his
comments justified, and it published
them because the public has a right
to know when its Parliamentary rep-
resentatives seem unable to
discuss properly a grave issue
concerning Australian soldiers
at war. Further, not only has
no member of the Ministry
complained about the report
either to The Bulletin or to
Alan Reid, but one Liberal
backbencher, Sir Wilfred Kent
Hughes, after reading the
Hansard report of the debate,
told some of the “gigglers”
that they “got what was com-
ing to them” and that if there
was another such incident he
would stand up in Parliament
and support Mr Reynolds, the
Labor member who started
the debate. Finally, readers
are invited to refer to the
Hansard report for October
20, 1965, on pages 2040 to
2047, and form their own
opinion.
The Bulletin as much as
anyone recognises that vaude-
ville has its place in Parlia-
ment; every moment cannot
be solemn and tense. But
when a matter as important as
the treatment of Australian
troops at war is concerned,
vaudeville has no place what-
ever, and the Government
backbenchers cannot evade
the criticism that they did not
rise to the occasion by accus-
ing people who report the
facts of irresponsibility
especially when, given the
complacency of the Govern-
ment and the ineffectiveness
of the Opposition, it is to
these backbenchers that one is forced
to look to maintain Parliamentary
standards of criticism. Dr Gibbs’
letter does nothing to reassure Aus-
tralians that the Parliamentary crisis
will be anything but prolonged. It is
this, not journalism, which is damag-
ing Australian politics.


THIS AUSTRALIA
POLITICS
The Quiet Left
Labor leadership?
By ALAN REID
P. GALVIN
F. CHANEY
The Labor Party’s Left wing has changed its tactics discernibly in Federal Parlia-
ment. For instance, Dr Jim Cairns (Lab. Vic.) has certainly been physically present
in the chamber of the House of Representatives over recent weeks. But he has spoken
sparingly.
Other Labor parliamentarians regarded
as belonging to the Left have been simi-
larly taciturn: quiet on the legislation of
Labor Minister William McMahon curb-
ing the control of the Waterside Work-
ers’ Federation; quiet on the defence esti-
mates which have been passing through
the Parliament. On such items in pre-
vious years the Left wing have screamed
long and loudly.
This year whatever screaming they
have done has been muted. They have
left the main conduct of controversial
debates to the Right whose views the
Left would normally resent. The Right—
understandably—are wondering what is
going on. Some of them are wondering
whether the Labor leader, Mr Arthur
Calwell, has changed his mind since he
asserted publicly some time ago that he
would be leading Labor at the next
elections, and whether the Left wing,
-given a hint of this, has decided to “go
quietly” in the hope that it will be the
individual they support rather than
somebody the Right wing will back who
will succeed Calwell in the Labor leader-
ship. Whatever the reason there is no
doubt that the Left wing is temporarily
sheltering behind the respectability of the
Right wing. The defence estimates debate
showed this. Not a man who could be
regarded as a Labor Left-winger partici-
pated. Labor speakers were Deputy Op-
position Leader Gough Whitlam, Pat
Galvin, chairman of the Federal Parlia-
mentary Labor Party defence committee
and a member of the Federal Parliament-
ary Labor Party executive, Kim Beazley
and Frank Crean, also members of the
executive, Gordon Bryant. Sam Benson
(a wartime captain of a naval vessel),
George Gray, who has been a per-
sistent advocate of a larger defence
effort. William Fulton and Ernest
Harding, who made no bones about
saying. “The people in my area are more
than a little defence - conscious.”
Galvin, a tough man whom the Left has
never yet been able to intimidate, des-
pite their control of the ALP machine,
probably set the tone for Labor speakers.
Galvin went much further than any
Labor speaker I have heard in recent
years has gone on defence issues. Galvin
is a man who has consistently supported
the Australian alliance with the United
States, including times when his fellow
Right-wingers were cowed into submis-
siveness by anti-United States forces
within the ALP machine and the Labor
Parliamentary Labor Party. Recently
Galvin produced the novel suggestion
that Australia should set up in the United
States an Australian “lobby”, identified
as such in Washington to educate United
Sates opinion-makers to the fact that
the Australian alliance was of value t|
the United States.
To mention nuclear weapons in tht
Labor Party except with pious horror ij
considered heresy of the worst typej
Galvin, however, pointed out that
policy of the ALP was to make clear Aust
tralia’s intention to defend itself to thj
limit of its ability. Said Galvin grimly!
“Modern weapons of war are certainl'
needed if we are to deter a potential
aggressor. I advocate the immediate con-
struction of nuclear power stations. I adi
mit frankly that once we have nucleai
power stations we would possess the
potential to make the bomb. But wd
should not delay the development of this
nation and the provision of modern
methods of defence simply because we
fear the manufacture of the bomb. Foil
the construction of the nuclear poweii
stations the defence power should be ini
voked. Once Australia possesses nucleai
power we shall have a sufficient deterrent
against any possible aggressor. A likely
aggressor would know that nuclear power
stations, although they functioned for
the peaceful development of the nation,
could be swiftly converted to the manu-
facture of modern and powerful weapons
if the need ever arose.”
None of the Labor speakers after Gal-
vin went as far as he did. Crean —a cau-
tious man—had an accountant’s peep at
the expenditure of £382,000,000 for de-
fence and then stayed on the safe ground
of advocating more work for the Wil-
liamstown Naval Dockyard (in his elec-
torate) and the subdivision for housing
of the Williamstown Rifle Range (also
in his electorate). Other Labor speakers,
including Bryant and Gray, tended to
dwell wistfully upon the achievement in
preparation for defence of nations smaller:
than Australia, such as Sweden, Switzer-
land and Israel. Gray said “with a popu-j
lation only two-thirds of ours Sweden
has a militia force of 600,000 men who!
can be mobilised within 72 hours, and
has a front-line air force of 1000, of
which 600 have been designed and con-
structed in Sweden”. Other Labor speak-
ers dealt with supply shortcomings, in-
cluding Benson who said “as far as de-
fence hardware is concerned we are the
greatest bargain-hunters the world has
ever known, but it would be far better
if they were to get as much as they
can within Australia because when the
heat is on we will have to rely upon
ourselves”.
Navy Minister Fred Chaney who
showed that he had learned much from
his mishandling of the Voyager debate
put in a good performance, soberly
answering Opposition criticisms. He com-
mented, “I do not think I have heard
more constructive suggestions or more
constructive speeches.”


WATERFRONT
WWF Goes Salvaging
"Sand in the wind.”
By JOHN BROCKETT
1 The tame acceptance last week by the Waterside Workers’ Federation of the
new waterfront recruitment proposals showed that the Federation, after all, has learned
something from history. The acceptance was in line with the recent conciliatory
manner of the Federation but, more importantly, it increased the chance of the WWF
salvaging something for its members.
The new provisions spelt out in
detail for the first time last week
showed that so far as future recruitment
goes, the Federation will have no say
whatever. Until the conference there
was hope within the WWF that some
vestige of a discretionary power on
recruitment might be left with the
Federation, but at the conference table
there was virtually no opposition from
the WWF representatives or those of
the ACTU.
Before the conference began the WWF
officials had agreed that to fight what
was a fait accompli would be throwing
sand into the wind and so, without
serious argument, the Federation gave up
a right it had held for 18 years and
which in the past it had fought strongly
to retain.
The objective of the Federation and
the ACTU at the meeting was not to do
anything that would reduce the possi-
bilities of future gains. Finally, and
almost too late, the Federation has faced
up to the fact that reckless militancy is
industrial suicide. Naturally, this has
been an agonising decision for the
Federation, but one in which, for the
first time since his election as general
secretary four years ago, ALP man Mr
C. H. Fitzgibbon feels that he is in a
decisive position. His new strength comes
from support by Communist officials.
However, it is an entente of desperation
for the Communists. They calculate that
a collision with the Federal Government
at this time would create a situation in
which the current ruling junta would be
removed—leaving the Communist Party
power base on the waterfront in grave
jeopardy. (Mr Fitzgibbon almost cer-
tainly will exercise his new influence in
the Melbourne WWF branch elections
this month by playing a major role in
the organisation of a genuine ALP
ticket.)
The Communist Party has bitter
memories of the demise of the Miners’
Federation and the Seamen’s Union,
both brought down by their unreasonable
militancy. They now appear determined
to save the WWF from a similar fate.
In the coalmines and on the water-
front the trade unions have hastened the
introduction of automation and mechan-
isation, the very things their actions
were designed to stop. Reduced job
opportunities followed without any sig-
nificant gains by the unions concerned.
The Miners’ Federation provided the
first example. It blindly opposed mechan-
isation. Now the strength of the union
is down to just over 11,000 compared
with about 24,000 ten years ago. Mech-
anisation is accepted and widespread, but
few tangible benefits followed for the
men affected.
The Seamen’s Union failed to learn
from the miners and now it, too, is reap-
ing the consequences. Its members are
frequently complaining of the controls
they have to work under, which make
those of the new waterfront legislation
seem benevolent by comparison.
Under the seamen’s award accepted
by the union’s Federal secretary, Mr
E. V. Elliott, last October, seamen have
surrendered what would have been
regarded as basic rights. Members can
be directed to any port to fill vacancies
and must remain there for 30 days.
When insufficient labor is available, the
marine superintendent, a government
official, may seek applications by adver-
tisement or “other means”.
The award is officially known as the
“Seamen’s Stabilisation Scheme” and no
one could deny that it has brought
stability to the industry. Its introduction
followed repeated sailing delays allegedly
because of crew shortages. But since its
appearance there have been no crew
shortages and very few delays. The re-
strictive clauses of the award were accep-
ted by Elliott for a doubling of weekend
penalty rates which yield about £6 a week
to members, but significantly other mari-
time unions have received the monetary
benefits without the restrictions.
Letters to the Seamen’s Union journal
testify to rank-and-file discontent at the
new award, but officially there is no
complaint. The union, which had about
8000 members ten years ago, at October
1 this year had a membership down to
2255. For the Seamen's Union the fight is
over.
These precedents, arid its own experi-
ences, should have provided a warning
for the WWF that the problem of
mechanisation and automation cannot be
successfully met by blind opposition. The
WWF itself has hastened the introduc-
tion and use of bulk carriers and roll-on,
roll-off-type ships. Twelve years ago
about 350 members of the WWF were
employed at the Pyrmont sugar wharf
in Sydney. Now bulk carriers discharge
their cargoes and leave port inside 24
hours without the assistance of a single
WWF member. There was no mechanis-
ation fund to compensate those that
lost their jobs. However, the new policy
of the Federation could help bring such
a fund into existence.
DEFENCE
Skyhawks
A new strike carrier?
The decision to buy ten US Sky hawk
fighter-bombers (two of them trainers)
for use in the aircraft-carrier “Mel-
bourne” is the latest up-turn in Govern-
ment fluctuations over whether the Navy
will have an offensive capacity, a fleet air
arm, and an ability to protect itself
against hostile aircraft, cruisers, or sur-
face missile-carrying ships.
Only a tiny new bite is being taken
of the national defence expenditure to
provide the slight (although welcome)
capability the Skyhawks will give us. It
would seem that the Navy has persuaded
the Government to obtain them by cut-
ting to a minimum the refit of the
Melbourne and deferring (abandoning?)
construction of a second fleet replenish-
ment ship. Thus less than an extra £2
million, on balance, is required to be
spent.
In the Navy’s terms, the new priority
is understandable. In the nation’s interest,
there must be some doubts whether the
piecemeal refit of Melbourne will be
adequate, and whether the loss of flexi-
bility from not having two naval tankers
should be allowed to continue.
We should not get too elated over the
Skyhawks. They are much better than
the Sea Venoms they are replacing, but
they are not the most modern aircraft.
They are a valuable temporary measure,
and mark an important change of Gov-
ernment attitude. If that attitude is not
to change once again to wholesale
dependence on our allies, and unless
someone can provide a cheaper but
equally effective alternative, we must
decide very soon on the purchase of a
new strike carrier with supersonic air-
craft.

FUEL
BP and Moonie
Blaming the tankers
The Federal Government’s fitful stabs
at implementing a national fuel policy
were bound to inflict wounds in the
accounts of the big international oil com-
panies who dominate the Australian
market.
Now their energetic entreaties to the
Tariff Board, at its oil enquir> earlier this
year, have been followed up by a cata-
logue of complaints by the board of
British Petroleum, spelling out the effect
of the stabs on its profi.ability, at a time
when the group is in the throes of vigor-
ous expansion. Filling in the background
to its 47 per cent drop to £l.B million
in group profit last year which reduced
earnings on the £43.2 million sharehold-
ers' funds (all owned by the parent com-
pany in Britain) to 2.8 per cent, the
directors point the bone hard at R. \\.
Miller’s tankers, and also at the Govern?
ment’s fixed price of 3.50 dollars fot
Moonie oil. of which the company has
been taking its obliged share.
With its only completed refinery af
Kwinana in WA, the group is understand'
ably more sensitive to rises in coasta
transport freights than the other inter
nationals. BP will look forward to sontj
relief from Miller's intrusions when its!
new £l5 million refinery at Westernport'
in Victoria comes on stream next year.!
For the record, the directors say that last
year “the additional cost incurred in the
use of Australian flag tankers for inter-
state transport of prod-sets was
£901,250”. This accounted for most of
the drop from £ll.B to £10.6 million in,
gross profit from trading in a year when,!
despite intensified competition in market-
ing, one might have expected profits to
have increased, in line with the rise of
9.8 per cent in Australia’s consumption
of petroleum products.
No figure is put on the additions to
costs incurred by the enforced use of
Moonie oil of which BP, like other refin-
ers, has taken its share (actually 54,425
tons in 1964-65) even before the recent
Government edict. The report, however,
makes a very pointed reference to the
fact that the Government fixed the price
of Moonie oil 50 cents higher than
recommendet by the Tariff Board,
and complains that the formula for com-
puting its share fails to take account of
products exported. This means that BP
has to take a bigger share of the high
priced Moonie oil than seems fair because
it is the largest exporter of products. It
comments ironically that this is not cal-
culated to encourage exports. Fair
enough. Its own exports fell 320,817 to
542,248 tons last year, but this was
mainly because new refineries were estab-
lished in some of the company's estab-
lished markets.
The worsening of BP’s profit experi-
ence has not inhibited the group in its
massive expansion programme which
embraces all aspects of its Australian
operation and stretches inter alia into the
industry of the moment, nitrogenous fer-
tilisers. Some local eyebrows were raised
when this overseas-owned group culled
£lO million from the Australian capital
market on debenture earlier this year.
The overseas parent has not been shy in
putting in more cash itself. In fact in the
last twelve months it has subscribed
£2O million cash for shares and this has
been solid grist for our overseas reserves.

ELECTIONS
On Trial
Bondi’s shifting sand
By BRIAN JOHNS
It is the Labor Opposition which is on the defensive in the first by-elections held
since the Liberal and Country Parties’ breakthrough in New South Wales in May.
The brazen acceptance by the former
Labor Minister for Housing, Mr “Abe”
Landa, of the Premier Mr Askin’s offer
of the Agent-General’s sinecure in Lon-
don left the Government with the initia-
tive in the confrontation at Bondi.
Labor is fighting on shifting sand. Mr
Landa, backed by his then personal
prestige as a Minister and long-time local
member, held Bondi in the May election
by the uncomfortable margin of 1600
votes.
Inevitably this makes the central
question on November 6: Can Labor hold
its vote? The by-election for the country
seat of Oxley, caused by the death of Mr
L. C. Jordan, who won the seat first as
an Independent, then as a Country Party
candidate and finally as a Liberal, is very
much of secondary interest. All that
stands to be answered by Oxley is
whether the seat will be won by the
Liberals or the Country Party, whose
candidate, Mr Bruce Cowan, a Taree
estate agent, is clear favorite. The
Liberals have nominated a dairy far-
mer, Mr A Denis, from Richmond,
from outside the electorate. Mr
Denis may be able to take the sting
from a central issue in Oxley the city
price dairy farmers in the area receive
for their milk. Interestingly, one of the
Independent candidates in Oxley is the
test cricketer, Mr Johnnie Martin.
Bondi is far more complicated. It
is a heterogeneous electorate in which
the two strongest characteristics are an
unusually heavy Jewish population of an
estimated 3000 voters and a strong con-
centration of Catholics nearly 9000
in the electorate’s total of 22,000. As
an Irish Jew Mr Landa comfortably strad-
dled these two large segments. Labor’s
candidate on Saturday is former Federal
member Mr Syd Einfeld, who is a pro-
minent figure in the Jewish community.
The Liberal candidate is a real estate
agent, Mr John Barraclough, 39.
Mr Barraclough will undoubtedly be
helped by the DLP’s nomination of
former Sydney City Council Alderman,
Mr W. Slowgrove. The DLP gained 881
votes when it contested Bondi in 1959.
And this time it could well be the decisive
force. As would be expected, the DLP
is making much of its role in the Federal
Liberal and State Governments’ Aid
programmes for independent schools.
Catholics are being provided by the DLP
with an itemised account of the benefits
they have received, including those to a
number of schools attended by children
from the Bondi electorate. Significantly,
Catholic clergy in the Bondi area are
known to be sympathetic to the DLP.
Mr Askin goes into the by-election
with a nicely turned brand image of
a hustling Government. (How much the
result of the enthusiasm of the Sydney
Press refreshed by the fact that it at
last has a successful product to sell?)
The Premier, largely by the mere estab-
lishment of Cabinet sub-committees •
on law reform, hospitals, drought relief
and boards of inquiry, has created an
atmosphere of activity long absent from
politics in New South Wales.
Opposition Leader Mr Renshaw, being
tested on the ground he lost the last
election, the city, is attempting to tarnish
the Askin image on rent control and
the Government’s failure to hold down
prices. The choice of rent control as
an issue is shrewd. Bondi is a dormitory
suburb made up largely of tenanted pro-
perties. In the confusion surrounding the
antiquated Landlord and Tenant Act,
Mr Renshaw has been able to strike
at one “simple” element introduced by
the new Government: “wealthy” tenants
those with an income of £3OOO
can be forced to re-negotiate their cur-
rent rentals; with this as his starting
point Mr Renshaw, despite disclaimers
by the Government, is portraying the
Coalition as having new ideas for a gen-
eral easing of rent control.
NEW GUINEA
Black Wages
Sugar costs the same
An historical Industrial Arbitration and
Conciliation case which is as much a
pioneer in Papua-New Guinea as was
the first basic wage case in Australia,
began in Port Moresby on Tuesday,
October 26, and adjourned until early
December after the Employers’ Federa-
tion was granted the right to intervene
on the ground that the outcome would
affect wages in private enterprise.
The matter concerns rates of pay for
indigenous public servants who, since
September, 1964, have been paid on
scales approximately 60 per cent lower
than those paid to Australian public
servants with the Territory Administra-
tion.
The rates were set by the Common-
wealth Government on the basis that
the Territory itself could not support
a Public Service paid at Australian rates.
Administration representatives have
pointed to other emerging nations to
illustrate their point.
As against this, indigenous public ser-
vants claim:
• That a pound of sugar costs the same

• That by virtue of a system of rentals

introduced, the indigenous public
servant is now required to pay more
rental than previously when he was

have to pay and who almost always

REAL ESTATE
The Wealthy Tenants
A compromise rental
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
For the first time since the Second World War there has been a real estate boon
in Sydney in tenanted flats. This follows a pilot scheme by the New South Walt
Government to obtain increased rentals from “wealthy” tenants.
Real estate agents have reported
increasing interest from investors in flat
properties which is the direct result of
Government’s plans to compel tenants,
earning more than £3OOO a year, to pay
rent on controlled premises based on
current value.
In July the State Minister of Justice,
Mr Maddison, sent out notices to over
200 tenants, charged by landlords as
being wealthy tenants (a wealthy tenant
is one whose gross annual income from
all sources, together with the gross
income of the spouse, is £3OOO or over.
Income includes all allowances regarded
as income for taxation purposes, the
value of any board and lodging paid by
children of the tenant). Mr Maddison
expects to receive many more appliq
tions from landlords alleging they hj
wealthy tenants who could afford to pa!
rents based on the current value of cor.'
trolled premises.
In 22 of the 212 cases investigate!
by the Minister so far no evidence ha!
been found to support the landlord)
claim that the tenant was wealthy withil
the meaning of the Act. Some tenant!
have in fact compromised with the land-
lord and are paying at a figure some!
where between the current rent and th
amount sought.
The Government has suggested t<
landlords seeking rent increases to firs
approach the tenant to negotiate a new
rental under Section 17A of the Land-
lord and Tenant (Amendment) Act. I|
these negotiations break down, then the!
landlord can take action against a
“wealthy” tenant. The landlord asks the
Minister of Justice, or the Rent Con-
troller to help him establish his “wealthy”
claim. The Rent Controller assesses the
current rental of the property, based on
the assessed annual value, plus one ninth,
Providing the landlord agrees with the
compromise rental, the Rent Controller
goes a step further by asking the tenant
(failing his refusal to agree to the com-
promise) to answer a questionnaire
setting out his income from all sources,
together with that of his spouse. The
tenant is also told that if he fails to
furnish this financial information, or
refuses to negotiate within three weeks,
the Minister has the power to exclude
the premises from rent and eviction
control.
However, there have been instances of
landlords taking the law into their own
hands, and adopting 1 threatening and
overbearing tactics. In the Legislative
Assembly last week the Minister described
as “sharp practice” the action of some
landlords in demanding that tenants enter
into an agreement under section 17A of
the Landlord and Tenant Amendment
Act.
Mr Maddison’s remarks were promp-
ted by a question from the Liberal mem-
ber for Vaucluse, Mr K. R. Doyle who
claimed some landlords had sent letters
to tenants seeking increases in rentals,
irrespective of whether the tenants could
reasonably be expected to fall within the

BY
definition of wealthy tenants. Mr Mad-
dison has advised tenants who received
such letters to contact the Rent Con-
troller, and assured tenants, who failed to
negotiate, and who were not wealthy, that
they had nothing to fear from the Gov-
ernment on de-controlled action.
Recently the Minister lifted rent-
control on a century-old Sydney mansion,
occupied by a lone “stay-put” woman
tenant. Mr Maddison said the woman
refused to vacate the premises even
though she was offered premiums of up
to £750 to leave and a mortgage company
had offered to buy her a two-bedroomed
unit up to the value of £5OOO and allow
her to remain there for up to ten years
at her present rental of £5 18s. a week.
Mr Maddison said he had exercised his
ministerial powers of decontrol because
he was not prepared to stand by and see
people suffer. Because of the woman’s
refusal to leave the mansion the mort-
gagee company could not get vacant pos-
session which would enable it to sell to
a development company, and conse-
quently the bankrupt estate of the mort-
gagor was paying interest on a debt of
£136,000 at the rate of £lOOO a month.
The present system of rental
increases, while one of administration
procedure, will be included in the Land-
lord and Tenant Act, and administered
by the Fair Rents Board. Mr Maddison
is still working on the draft bill to
amend the Act, which is expected to
come before State Parliament about
December.
This draft bill confirms the Askin
Government’s election pledge of no
general increase in rent. But at this stage
doubt exists whether commercial and
business premises’ rents should be
decontrolled. Fears that decontrol of
these premises might cause undue hard-
ship is a chief factor inhibiting Govern-
ment action.
Already the Government has shown
it thinks unworkable some provisions of
the Act introduced by the previous
Labor Government last December. One,
for example, relates to the provision of
alternative accommodation. The Act as
amended last December provides that a
landlord seeking to repossess his home
must provide alternative accommodation
for the tenant. The new amendment will
return to magistrates the power to base
decisions on the relative hardship of
landlord and tenant.
Notice to quit, as in Victoria, will be
given consideration. Here a landlord may
give a tenant notice to quit if he proves
the tenant is able to pay more, or is in
a position to buy suitable premises.
SECTS
Disenchanted Brethren
“Secretive sub-world ”
BY DAVID HALPIN
The curtain of secrecy which surrounds the Exclusive Order of Brethren was
lifted a little last week by the weight of many disenchanted members, and out slipped
the startling news — Bruce Hale, the all-powerful Australian leader and two of his
lieutenants had been sacked and expelled from the sect.
Hale, his brother John, and Allan
Gadsden, of Melbourne, were toppled
and “withdrawn”—the Order’s term for
expulsion—after an extraordinary meet-
ing in the sect’s headquarters in Orchard
Street, Ashfield. The reverberations from
this meeting are still rippling through the
estimated 2000 members in Sydney and
the strong sect communities .in Mel-
bourne and Perth. The whole affair is
clouded with rumors, but the basic
mechanics of the purge are discernible.
Bruce Hale, an overwhelming and
dominating personality, and a son-in-law
of the world leader, “Big Jim” Taylor,
in New York, came to power six years
ago. He was undoubtedly the driving
force behind the increasing rigor prac-
tised against families within the Order,
which led to many long-term members
leaving the sect. But during the past year
he has ordered many wealthy members
to share their assets with other members,
as well as contributing a healthy slice
of their capital to the Order’s trust fund.
Five months ago Mr Hale, in the
course of pursuing this policy at a meet-
ing, asked a North Shore paint manu-
facturer for details of his finances. This
man objected strongly, and he was sum-
marily “withdrawn”. Fortunately for
him, his wife put her marriage before
the Order and stuck to him.
In an organisation such as the Breth-
ren, this incident normally would excite
only passing interest. But this time, three
American members sent to Australia by
“Big Jim” Taylor, were secretly taking a
tape recording of the whole affair. Before
flying back to the Order’s New York
headquarters, the Americans made some
strong remarks about Mr Hale’s be-
havior at the meeting. One of the
Americans was “Big Jim’s” son, and his
report led to some rapid communications
between New York and Sydney.
The former Australian leader, Mr John
Patton, of Roseville, and another senior
member of the sect, Dr David Martin, a
Macquarie Street oral surgeon, led the
move against the two Hale brothers and
Gadsden.
No radical changes are expected in
the Brethren under Mr Patton, who,
according to many veteran members, is
“just as strict and stern” as Bruce Hale,
but is “far more reasonable.”
Two things are certain to result from
the purge: Melbourne barrister Frank
Galbally, who is conducting an inquiry
into the Brethren, will be provided with
some fresh ammunition (he has state-
ments from 200 members and ex-mem-
bers at this stage of the investigation, but
he is revealing nothing until it is
finished); and the members and their
families who live in the secretive sub-
world of the Brethren will breathe a little
easier.


The Confessions of
Barry Humphries
“Friendship is tested rather in the thick days of success
than in the thin years of strugglesays Barry Humphries
in this story of his early years at Melbourne University ,
the ABC, the RSL ...
The headmaster leant, forward!
elbows on the huge desk, his)
brown fingers folded in an attitude'
of lay prayer, eyelids dropping with,
genuine concern: “I hope you're not
going pansy,” he said. Certainly I had!
been rather a worry to him. There was'
the matter of my longish hair, a sure!
sign of incipient pederasty; and then'
also an inexplicable and vexatious!
failure to participate wholeheartedly iH
those rough and tumble exertions on the|
playing field which, along with a patch\
scholarship, go to make up the
All - Rounder, or at best the Rhodesl
Scholar. There was the further ernbar-'
rassment that I had, by sheer fluke it
seemed, achieved spectacular results in
the External Matriculation exams, of
which my school record had held little,
if any, promise.
My friends were an odd lot, too. Ai
cliquey bunch, much given to subversive!
raillery at the back of the sixth form,
and to the exchange of caricatures both
of themselves and the long-suffering staff,
I recall, with a faint chagrin, our St
Trinian’s-like delight in asking “difficult”
questions. In short, we were just like
any other precocious, spotty little push
to be found knocking the system in all
big schools. The apocryphal story has
reached me that I spent those dismal
afternoons of compulsory attendance at
football matches sitting with my back
to the pitch, knitting. 1 can only say
that, since my back was turned, it was
assumed I was knitting.
I still number a few of my associates
of this remote time amongst my staunch-
est friends, since they have remained so
through thick and thin; and I have learnt,
by bitter experience, that true friend-
ship is tested rather in the thick days of
success than the thin years of struggle.
“I hope you’re not going pansy.” One
was aware at once of embarrassment on
behalf of one’s senior master, and a total
inability to supply, then at any rate, a
tactful reassurance; if indeed it was re-
assurance which was solicited. Riposts,
variously witty and outrageous, have
since presented themselves to my
imagination.
I did Law, of all things, in my first
year at the Shop. That was because an
Exhibition in British History, a general
Exhibition, and a Commonwealth
scholarship sufficed' me nothing in the
pursuit of the more congenial Arts
course. I lacked A Subject Other Than
English. I browsed on Matric. German
at night school and the year of Law
passed like a long, wet weekend. Of
course, there were parlor games to
alleviate it. Dadaism, that thrilling poetic
movement which had spilt with such
fortuitous bad taste into the visual arts,
had always enthralled me. We booked
the Men’s Lounge and held our inaugural
exhibition of Melbourne Dada.


This was years before the Rubinstein
Prize, or the course of my life would
have been vastly different. I had always
exhibited a talent for painting and had
spent months at the famed George Bell
Academy. The admirably purist theories
of my instructor served to dispel any
illusions I had until then entertained
about my prowess with the brush and
many a sheet of impastoed masonite was
stacked ruefully in the oblivion of my
family's toolshed. Francis Picabia’s
maxim “Art becomes a pleasure” be-
came my creed, and still earns a respect-
ful genuflection. Even today I feel a
slight aversion in the presence of any-
thing that looks too much like hard
work. Hard unpleasurable work.
The Dada exhibition was a Nice
Lunchtime’s Entertainment, with Nasty
overtones. Perhaps its most celebrated
exhibit was a pair of boots brimming
with custard, entitled “Pus in Boots”.
“A Nun’s Habit” also created something
of a sensation. The reactions of my
fellow students were diverse. A barely
altered portrait of the recently deceased
sovereign (discovered on a rubbish tip)
provoked violence amongst the more con-
ventional louts, whilst more subtle and
subversive artefacts angered and under-
mined the brainier youths and their ill-
considered and indiscriminate liberalism
and their pompous new-found espousal
of “modern art”. I remember being
irritated by facile undergraduate irrever-
ence; by the student mob who had learnt
to hiss in darkened auditoria without
knowing why. I espoused the anti-prank;
I wanted the spire to surmount the
chamber pot. And I acted in student
plays.
I failed Law, scraped through German,
but the will to work, if it had ever been
manifest, disappeared irrevocably. Then
came National Service in that slough of
despond, Puckapunyal. Scatalogical
Regulars marched me off to compulsory
depilation. Cretinous almni of the
University Regiment snickered and
strutted on latrine inspection. I wangled
a cushy job as scenic designer for the
camp concert, and insisted that the
enormous hessian backdrops be embel-
lished with special paints which were
obtained at enormous expense, and by
staff car, from remote Melbourne. A
subsequent military enquiry into the
excessive costs of this production caused
official eyebrows to rise when it was
learnt that several pounds of a pigment
made from the pulverised wings of
Korean butterflies had been used to
enliven my somewhat ephemeral mise
en scene.
I began my Arts course, majoring in
English and Fine Arts. I presented a
second Dada exhibition, and a revue
called “Call Me Madman”, in which
the audience of gay young iconoclasts
was invited to exhibit its earnestness and
behave with total irrationality. On the
stage of the Union Theatre two of us
masqueraded as a missionary and his
wife deploring Indian famine conditions
over a table groaning with produce. A
wholly salutary concern for the plight
of starving millions gave way to a marital
tiff, which, in turn, led to a playful ex-
change of edible missiles. This developed
until the audience were pelted with food,
and the moment of triumph was finally
achieved when they began to participate
in the irrational free-for-all, and demon-
strated, with a mindless vehemence,
exactly the moral point we had sought
to make. The basis for this sketch was
written by my old friend and Dadaist
colleague, John Perry, to whose genius
I would here pay the profoundest respect.
The revue was censoriously reported on
the front page of the Melbourne “Sun”
alongside the Fadden Budget.
I performed in more conventional
student revues, and in a couple of plays
for the newly formed Union Repertory
Company under John Sumner; and
abandoned my course.
Edna and Girlie Pogson
A t about this point in my life I met
Peter O’Shaughnessy who was then
about 31 and had just got back from
England. Subsequently I appeared in
a number of his independent produc-
tions, and he, more than anyone else,
encouraged me to pursue the life of an
actor. However, it was not until a year
later, when I had attained my majority,
that I became what is known as “a full-
time professional”. A year with the firm
of EMI intervened, where I was variously
employed as a wholesale record sales-
man and breaker of recently obsolete 78
records. This latter chore produced a
more acute form of nervous exhaustion
than I had experienced in my less com-
pulsory Dadaist activities, though it bore
an ironic resemblance to them. During
this period of painful creative adoles-
cence, I continued to act (for O’Shaugh-
nessy and student groups), but rescue
was not forthcoming until Sumner in-
vited me to tour Victoria playing Prince
Orsino in “Twelfth Night” and to join the
Repertory Company under Ray Lawler’s
direction. I did. The season ended with
a revue and, since the Olympic Games
were looming, it was thought that a
sketch about a Melbourne housewife
billeting, or offering to billet, a foreign
athlete might prove amusing. Ray Law-
ler, not having been deaf to certain of
my more strident party turns, suggested
I should write the sketch and play the
housewife. Mrs Norm Everage was
bom.
Soon after this I went up to Sydney
to work at the Phillip Street Theatre,
and I found, to my great pleasure, that
the Olympic hostess sketch was popular
there and that Mrs Everage was by no
means unknown in New South Wales.
I also devised a recitation called
“Maroon” in which Edna examined an
aspect of the color question. Patrick
White has told me that “Maroon” was
an old favorite of his, and we have a
private ambition to perform “in the
Halls” a tea-shop dialogue between Edna
Everage and the inimitable Girlie Pog-
son. Gordon Chater might appear as the
waitress, bearing hot suggestions, aspara-
gus and cheese dreams, and the odd iced
vo-vo. At this time, also, I wrote a short
story called “Sandy Stone’s Big Week”,
which glowed with the inner cosiness of
apricot jam, and formed the basis for
my Wild Life in Suburbia monologues.
I knew a number of the Sydney
Libertarians who used often to speak of
the “old” days of the Lincoln and the
Tudor, and were alternately congratulat-
ing themselves on having avoided the
pitfalls of literacy and extolling Walt
Whitman and Oscar Wilde as if no one
had ever heard of them before. In
knocking arty bunkum, their very down-
rightness became curiously dandiacal;
poetical affectation is rarely avoided by
the use of lower-case type —on the
contrary one would have thought. It is
interesting that some of these colorful,
free-living puritans have now succeeded
in confronting the problems of creative
integrity by working in advertising,
which at least has a code.
While I was in Sydney I was engaged
by an obscure agent to perform at the
Granville RSL and I made the long
Sunday morning train journey, uncertain
of what precisely I would do for them.
I had no “act” as such, so resolved to
perform an old expressionist party turn
called Tid—a harrowing piece in which
an androgynous and eldritch child is
interviewed by a benign psychiatrist (also
played by me) until the characters are
reversed and the doctor capitulates to
his patient. I might add that I had never
been to an RSL in my life. Arriving
at the Hall, I was chilled to observe
a battery of plangent poker machines
at peak performance. Long plastic
entrails disgorged the gelid, banana-
scented beer. There was another
comedian on the bill, and he chivalrously
offered to warm up the audience with
a few risque stories, which reduced the
clamorous audience to, a condition of
reverent hush as I stepped on to the plat-
form. The first few lines of Tid served
only to enhance the almost palpable
silence; and then, to my alarm, the
audience rose silently and, one by one,
resumed their posts at bar and poker
machines. The rest of my ill-calculated
act was lost in uproar. I have the uneasy
apprehension that the same thing might
happen now, were I to put in a pleasant
Sunday morning down Granville way.

Computers today play a key role in finance, transportation, defence,
science, medicine in practically every industry and profession. They
are not widely understood, perhaps due to their amazing capabilities.
with /S^W2r^ n P^iTf^f e^eV“e l aife? t^ n£ Sl s^.^ r »
biggest user/manufacturer of computers General Electric presents
this series of guides to various aspects of computer operation.
WHAT
COMPUTERS
DO
MODERN electronic computers perform thou-
sands of tasks each day. However all these
can be grouped into seven major types of work.
PROCESSING BUSINESS DATA. Computers
swallow and distill oceans of paper. They bal-
ance bank accounts, figure payrolls, check tax
returns, update insurance records, keep track
of supplies, and send out bills.
SOLVING MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS. Com-
puters make it possible for researchers and
engineers to move ahead quickly to the solution
of research, testing, and design problems. For
scientists, and others, the computer eliminates
the drudgery of routine problem solving.
CONTROLLING MANUFACTURING PLANTS.
Computers have begun to take over complete
''on-line" control of certain kinds of processes,
including oil refining, electricity generation,
and even cookie-baking. Through direct con-
nection to the instruments and controls of the
process the computer checks measurements
and automatically changes the controls to keep
the plant running at the highest possible
efficiency. Unlike other computers, process
computers, to be most effective, must be
designed to fit particular jobs. General Electric,
for instance, has designed a type of process
computer that withstands the corrosive atmos-
phere of chemical plants.
wtrt-Tr-
mathematical formula (math model) for testing
purposes. In the case of the airplane, for
instance, the engineer constructing the math
model would take into account all the factors
that would determine whether the plane would
fly, such as weight, wing span and engine
thrust. He would assign number values to each
of these factors. By varying the numbers and
working out the formula in the computer, he
would be able to simulate what the plane would
do under a far greater variety of conditions than
could ever be simulated by a physical model of
the airplane "flown" in a wind tunnel.
STORING AND RETRIEVING KNOWLEDGE.
Thanks to the computer, we are beginning to
be able to make use of all the valuable informa-
tion available around the world. Summaries of
printed information about steel production or
heart disease, for instance, can be compiled,
sorted, and stored in the computer and re-
printed on a moment’s notice. This is being
done for scientists, lawyers and engineers on
an increasing scale.
CONTROLLING COMMUNICATION. Armed
forces, government agencies, and large indus-
trial corporations today are increasingly linking
their communications facilities, data-collection
systems and computers in complex networks
that can route information to offices and plants
around the country, process it, and produce
up-to-the-minute reports.
TRANSLATING LANGUAGES. The computer is
helping us solve one of the greatest barriers
to the gathering of information translation
of foreign languages into our own. While this
is still in an early stage, before long computers
should be able to store vast dictionaries of
words and grammar rules, to give translations
many times faster than language experts.
In each of these seven kinds of work, the
computer gets the job done far more efficiently
than it could possibly be done by man alone.
But what's the computer's secret ? What makes
it such a powerful tool for extending man's
brain power ? The answer lies in the computers
four special characteristics.
INCREDIBLE SPEED. The computer works one
step at a time. These are simple steps that any
high school or college student could do. But the
difference between the student and the com-
puter is that the computer is able to do a
million or more steps in a single second. It can
do in a few minutes the same amount of work
that you, with pencil and paper, would take
years to do. Some GE computers can add
250,000 1 6-digit numbers in one second. J
PERMANENT MEMORY. The computer can /
the computer never forgets.
GREAT ACCURACY. Because of its fantastic
speed, the computer can solve problems the
long and most accurate way. For example, a
computer could easily divide 6.1382313290 into
23.5439189113. By contrast most people,
would probably settle for dividing 6.1 into 23.5.
WORKS AUTOMATICALLY. The computer has
two abilities that together enable it to work
automatically. It can remember a set of instruc-
tions, and it can execute these instructions in
sequence without human direction. If you were
a computer operator, for instance, you could
feed instructions into the computer, then go
have lunch. The computer would work auto-
matically, step by step, figuring the solution.

It was soon after this that I discovered
my ability to deliver long the extempore)
diatribes of Mrs Everage.
I did a couple of television reviews foi
the ABC, and it was an item in one of
these in which I conducted an imaginary
interview with a well-known blue stock,
ing and darling of the Commission that
I fell foul of that mighty network. Thisf
was before satire became a household
word, like Omo.

Neil Singleton
’W/'ith the exception of those
of the Granville RSL who so justi-
fiably refused to be put upon, I have
experienced nothing but the greatest
pleasure in entertaining Australian audi-
ences. The relation between a solo per-
former and his audience, is, however,
fundamentally a hostile one, and it is the
artist's duty to seduce them into an
affectionate rapport by the most subtle
means at his command. Each laugh is a
victory. It’s all a rather primitive affair,
Naturally I get my share of Green Room
advice. “How do you feel about all those
Mrs Everages enjoying the show?” is a
not infrequent question on the lips of
youth. “Thought you missed a few points
in that Neil Singleton sketch,” said a Neil
Singleton. Then there are enthusiastic
young men with very clean finger-nails
who “aren’t sure about Mrs Everage’s
drag”; and pococurantist middle-aged
New Australians with maculate fingers
who rasp: “I’m vundering vether you're
verse another scrutiny?” (This before I've
opened!). And nice grizzled ped-
agogues who (rather flatteringly) rush
forward and lay claim to having nurtured
my fledgeling talent. “Doesn’t it worry
you that people laugh?” ventured another
earnest person. Far from wishing to
change society, I can only hope that my
audience will pause, reflect for a moment,
and pass on their immutable way; not
forgetting, perhaps, to drop a coin in my
hat.
On my last trip home I made a formal
application for a rich American scholar-
ship and it was necessary for me to
attend an interview with an esteemed
educator who administrated the Fellow-
ship in Australia. He leant forward,
elbows on the huge desk, his pale fingers
folded in an attitude of lay prayer, his
eyelids dropping behind his half-moon
spectacles in genuine concern: “Mr
Humphries,” he said, “are you sure
you’re not just a flash in the pan.”


The Holy War
Out of the ghettos
ARCHBISHOP EZEKIEL
By BRIAN JOHNS
Now it is a Holy War bitterly dividing the 250,000 Greeks in parishes, clubs and
communities from Cairns to Perth but eventually the theological, political and
legal disputes surrounding His Eminence Archbishop Ezekiel, Archbishop of the Greek
Orthodox Church in Australia, New Zealand and all Oceania, might be merely some
of the trace marks of a minority group leaving its ghettos.
Both Archbishop Ezekiel’s supporters
and his antagonists recognise that the
Holy War, with its church lock-outs, ex-
communications t defrocking of priests,
running legal battles and murmurs of
physical violence, is partly buttressed by
the frustrations and intensities of a semi-
closed community.
The liveliest battleground is in Syd-
ney, Archbishop Ezekiel’s episcopal
seat. His most vociferous and resource-
ful opponents, the 1000 members of the
Greek Orthodox Community of New
South Wales, control three inner city
churches (of Sydney’s 13) including the
Church of the Holy Trinity at Surry
Hills, which, established in 1896, was
the first Orthodox Church in Australia.
However, the Archbishop has other
firmly-entrenched opponents controlling
churches in Newcastle, Melbourne,
Adelaide and among a number of country
communities.
For the great majority of the 18,000
Greek migrants arriving in Australia each
year mainly to Melbourne and Syd-
ney the church is the centre-point of
contact. It helps them find jobs, accom-
modation, smooths their difficulties with
secular officialdom, provides their social
outlets, as well as marrying them and
baptising their children. The Greeks may
be apathetic in their religious practice—
one estimate is that only 20 per cent are
regular in their duties —but, as with the
early Catholic migrants, the church
serves as their beleaguered social outpost
in forbidding environment.
As it is now, so it was in the early
days. The Churches were established
largely on lay initiative by Greek mig-
rants isolated in a strange community.
Tied to the Mother Church by the loos-
est of temporal bonds, the communities
developed their own pattern of admini-
stration. They incorporated themselves
as companies, each administering their
own finances. At no stage did the com-
munities welcome episcopal or clerical
efforts to get the communities to adopt
a unified approach.
The first breach between the laity and
the clergy occurred in 1926 when a
pioneer Orthodox Ordinary, Bishop
Christopher, was locked out of the Holy
Trinity Church in 1926 by dissident
parishioners. This dispute resulted in
the building of the Cathedral Church of
Sancta Sophia at Darlinghurst, the
second of the three churches figuring in
the current stage of the Holy War. The
split was not healed until 1945 when
the Churches of the Holy Trinity and
Sancta Sophia were united as the Greek
Orthodox Community of New South
Wales —a misleading name inasmuch as
it, even now, only takes in the three
churches.
This community is probably the rich-
est in Australia. According to its last
balance sheet it has assets worth close
on £109,500 and its income last year
from church collections, stipends and
other sources was more than £28,000.
The 35-year-old president of the com-
munity, Mr Demetrios Tsingris, a for-
mer secretary of Archbishop Ezekiel’s,
Master of Theology from Athens Uni-
versity, for three terms a student at
Sydney’s Moore Theological College (“I
wanted to improve my English.”), makes
it clear that in his view the dispute is
that of the laity fighting clericalism. He
claims that the community has no desire
to challenge Archbishop Ezekiel’s spiri-
tual authority, but merely wants to pre-
vent him exercising dictatorial rights
over the community’s temporal affairs.
However, it is a matter of record that
his Greek Orthodox Community of New
South Wales was only prevented by an
order of the Equity Court last year,
sought by a follower of the Archbishop
Ezekiel, from permitting a defrocked
Orthodox Bishop, Archbishop Photios,
from officiating at services in the three
Sydney churches under the community’s
control.
Supporters of Archbishop Ezekiel in-
stituted the court action, which flowed
from an attempt to change the com-
munity’s constitution soon after the
Archbishop’s appointment early in 1959.
Archbishop Ezekiel, now 54, has spent
22 years of his pastoral life in the
United States six years as a bishop
with a diocese embracing 13 US States
and parts of Canada. At the same time
he continued on the staff of the Greek
Orthodox Theological Seminary at
Brookline, Massachusetts, lecturing in
philosophy and theology.
Archbishop Ezekiel's attempt to change
the constitution of the dissident Greek
Community of NSW was apparently
part of an overall plan to go ahead with
establishing an integrated system of
communities, which his predecessor,
Archbishop Theophylactos, who had
served in Australia from 1928, had hope-
fully foreshadowed just before his death
in a car accident.
The integration moves inevitably re-
opened the faction fighting. Ostensibly
the issues were constitutional argu-
ments over the temporal rights of the
fiercely independent communities. But

because of the dose nature of the com-
munity life religious and political conten-
tions were quickly thrust into the fray.
Although even the participants find this
hard to estimate, it seems that the social
gulf between the arriving migrants and
the long-established members of the
Greek community spurred the strife
along.
Archbishop Ezekiel’s supporters point
out that the Community of NSW, with
its 1000 members, is only a small per-
centage of the Church’s adherents in the
State. Both sides agree that most of the
1000 members are migrants who have
come to Australia since the war. The
Archbishop has challenged this commu-
nity to open the membership to the
“mass of the Greek Orthodox Christians
and not to continue to restrict member-
ship”.
The community has replied that it
plans to extend the membership to 5000
and Mr Tsingris declared last week that
“we will go to 10,000”. Nevertheless,
Archbishop Ezekiel and his supporters
see the present limitation on the mem-
bership as being connected with the ex-
tent that the activities of its council “are
directed by the Atlas Club, a Communist-
dominated club in Sydney”. The Archi-
bishop’s antagonists have labelled this
as an “opportunistic policy” of “false
and unjust propaganda”.
A firm supporter of Archbishop Eze-
kiel, the Greek Consul-General in Syd-
ney, Mr P. Rellas, alleged last week that
there were five members of the Com-
munist Party on the 20-member execu-
tive and claimed that there were 50
Party members among the community
with “about 200 sympathisers”. Mr
Tsingris, who himself has been charged
with being a Communist (“As a theolo-
gian can I be a Communist? I am not
a Communist.”), denies that there are
Communists on the council and says
that neither are there members of the
Atlas Club on the present council,
although one of his assistants claims
that 10 years ago 12 members of the
Atlas Club were members of the coun-
cil this was when the present group
was not in control.
Meanwhile, Archbishop Ezekiel has
been developing the church apace. When
he arrived there were 19 priests, there
are now 50, and he has plans to open a
minor seminary next year for eight or
10 young candidates for the priesthood.
At the moment there is not an Australian-
born priest serving the 89 parishes or
communities, and only two have received
part of their education in Australia.
(Both are graduates of Melbourne Uni-
versity.)
For all the intrigue and strife in this
Holy War, both camps have been shout-
ing the necessity for an Australian
Church. So, there is no chauvinistic ex-
cuse for the outsider to be upset.

AROUND MELBOURNE
Timbertop and the Disposal Store
“A Woburn Abbey job at 2s. 6d. a head "
those rare creatures who live
in Malvern, and have memories
of school at Geelong Grammar, the
cup was almost running over. At one
stage rumor flew around town that
Old Geelong Grammarian ties were
available at Sammy Bear's famous dis-
posal store in Russell Street. Your
correspondent went round at the
speed of light to pick up half a dozen.
But no, it was untrue. Sammy Bear
said if there were any OGG ties
available the trade would be reserved
for the Old Country.
Actually Geelong Grammar began
to suffer with all the publicity, and
the school magazine came out very
smartly with a Prince Charles issue.
There was half a page devoted to
“fallacies shewn in the Australian
Press, and others”. It said (1) there
is no fagging at the school, never has
been any. and never wall there be any;
(2) only five boys, the school and
house captains, are allowed the privi-
lege of caning incessant trouble-
makers; (3) Prince Charles will not
be treated as the typical boy at Timber-
top; he will be subordinate to the
masters only and will be supervising
the boys; (4) he only has to get up
for breakfast at 7.30; (5) he doesn’t
have to perform any menial tasks,
and cannot undergo an initiation pro-
cedure that has never existed; (6)
Timbertop boys do two three-mile
cross-country runs a week and a 17-
mile marathon at the end of the year;
(7) the meals are far above the
standard of incessant mincemeat and
eggs.
Many an old boy would raise an
eyebrow at the statement that there
never has been fagging. Perhaps they
mean Timbertop only. But what really
hurt came from an unnamed Old Gee-
long Grammarian on the Londoner’s
Diary page of the “Evening Standard”:
“Within two seconds of a Geelong Boy
coming into a room at a party in
Australia you can tell that he went to
Geelong largely because they’re so
very arrogant. I know I was. They’re
very distinctive, and often not much
liked. All of the parents have to be
loathsomely rich to send the boys
there. Except mine, of course,” the
old boy said. Tempo replies: “It is
hoped that the report from an un-
named OGG in London is already
known to be untrue from the reports
of work in New Guinea, in the
Church, in the arts and the thousands
of other little things that OGGS
boys have done. There are very few
‘rich’ boys here, some families are
well off, others are sacrificing a lot to
send their sons to a place that has
Timbertop.”
The other place that suffered was
Haverbrack Avenue, Malvern. Actually
though, it was terribly good for the
area. Haverbrack Avenue is just two
streets away from Toorak, 5.E.2. For
those on the wrong side of Malvern
Road there has always been a tragedy
of being so near, yet so far. It is well
known that some of them have gone
as far as to change their letterheads
from 5.E.4 to 5.E.2.
One time Haverbrack was a fine
old property on Glenferrie Road and,
according to the official history of
Melbourne, it was virgin land carpeted
with flowers. Robert Singleton,
“Master in Equity”, bought it in 1868.
He also had a week-end house in the
Dandenongs and he used to keep in
touch between his two properties by
heliograph. But more important than
the official Malvern history, February,
1941, No. 2 Haverbrack Avenue
made the nice homes department of
“Home Beautiful”.
News of the purchase of the house
by Sir Robert made the headlines on
the Thursday, which meant that by
Saturday all Melbourne wanted to in-
spect it. The streams of cars began to
build up on the Saturday. They came
in solid cohorts on Sunday morning.
Invariably, there was a queue of six
to eight cars waiting for the look.
Some people walked over with dogs
from 5.E.2 and 5.E.3 and took up
viewing positions outside the gate.
Mr Graham Davey, former owner
and still in residence, maintained a
nice amiability through it all. He
found that he had to keep his gates
locked and only use the back garden.
He had one regret through it all. He
said: “You know, this could have been
a Woburn Abbey job, at 2s. 6d. a head.
I could have made a fortune for Hos-
pital Sunday.” Indeed he could, and
perhaps with Sir Robert making
occasional appearances at the window,
who knows, a charge of £1 a head
might have been feasible, particularly
on a Melburnian Sunday.

N EW YORK LETTER
The Death of Rasputin
An invasion of privacy?
From GEORGE McGANN
The racous sound from a loudspeaker mounted atop a truck in Center Street
invaded the courtroom on the third floor of the State Supreme Court. “Vote for Abe
Beanie for Mayor of New York,” the loudspeaker harshly implored.
The noise was so great that the presid-
ing judge had to ask a lawyer to suspend
temporarily his reading from a book
vividly recounting the assassination in
1916 of Rasputin, the “Mad Monk”, by
a band of Russian aristocrats headed by
Prince Felix Youssoupoff.
Those in the courtroom, entranced by
the bizarre tale of a murder a half-
century old, were reluctantly brought
back to the world of 1965 by the in-
truding political huckstering. Among the
rapt listeners in the courtroom were
Prince Felix himself, now a frail, bald,
half-deaf old man of 79 with a face
like stretched parchment, and his wife,
Princess Irina, who is also in her 70s
and so crippled from a recent hip injury
that she proceeds slowly with the help
of a cane.
This patrician pair, who have lived in
Paris since fleeing the Russian Revolu-
tion, had come to the Supreme Court
building in downtown Manhattan to
press a suit for 1,500,000 dollars in
damages against the Columbia Broad-
casting System for producing and tele-
vising a film. “If I Should Die”, based
on the Rasputin episode. Charging “in-
vasion of privacy” rather than libel, the
Prince contends that the TV drama was
an unauthorised, inaccurate, commercial
exploitation of his name and that it erred
in depicting his wife, Princess Irina, as
being used as “seductive bait” to lure
the lecherous Rasputin to his death.
The suit was reminiscent of the
successful libel action Youssoupoff
brought against the Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer company in London in 1934 for
its film, “Rasputin, the Mad Monk”, in
which the late John Barrymore portrayed
, the bearded fanatic who exerted almost
hypnotic powers over the Czarina and
other women of the Romanov court of
pre-revolutionary Russia. The London
jury agreed with Princess Irina that the
film had libelled her in implying an
illicit relationship with Rasputin, and
awarded her £25,000 in damages.
Hopes of a similar handsome award
have now inspired the elderly couple
to go through the tension and tedium of
another trial 31 years later. However,
this time their lawyers, notably the bril-
liant New York lawyer Fanny Ellen
Holtzman, who represented them in the
London libel action, have based their
suit on invasion of privacy, a concept
of law which is still being developed in
this country The suit raises the question
as to whether an admitted assassin (the
Prince has written two books describing
his part in the killing of Rasputin) has
the right to recover damages for the un-
authorised recounting of his deed, or
whether the historical results of his act
place it in the public domain and make
it available to any writer.
The defendant in the present action
also asks a further question—whether a
man who had written books about his
experiences had the right to claim “in-
vasion of privacy” when a TV play dealt
with those experiences later. “He is
guilty of doing the exact thing he now
accuses us of doing,” a defence lawyer
contended at the opening of the trial.
The dramatic highlight of the trial on
Center Street was the appearance of
the frail assassin in the witness chair,
to which he had to be assisted by court
attendants. The Prince’s eyesight, like
his hearing, is badly impaired. Further-
more, his English is poor and all ques-
tions had to be relayed through a trans-
lator seated beside him. This made for
a laborious pace but the bizarre nature
of his ancient crime was so fascinating
RASPUTIN
that courtroom observers patiently bore
all delays and repetitions. The details of
the grisly events of that wintry night
in the Youssoupoff family home, on the
eve of the revolution, had a startling
effect coming from the lips of the last
living participant in the drama. The
Prince graphically described the incred-
ible durability of the monk, who was
fed poisoned cakes and wine, shot,
beaten with a club and, still breathing,
was finally thrown into the icy Neva
River to drown.
After shooting Rasputin twice, the
Prince said he was horrified to find that
the monk had regained consciousness.
“He leaped up,” the Prince said in his
halting English, and hesitated. Then he
dramatically clutched his own throat to
portray Rasputin’s dying attempt to
throttle Youssoupoff. As his three fellow-
conspirators held the monk, Youssoupoff
then beat him bloody with a club. The
plotters carried Rasputin to the edge of
the nearby river and threw him into the
water.
The Prince’s responses in the witness
chair were not always what his principal
counsel, Herbert Zelenko, expected. This
was notably true in connection with the
motivation for the killing of Rasputin.
The Prince declared that his only reason

Rolex watches
You know their names as you know
your own. You know their faces
from a thousand newspaper and
magazine articles. You have seen
them and heard their voices on
newsreels and on your television
screen. Their actions and decisions
influence the pattern of our lives.
We cannot mention their names,
or show pictures of them. It would
not be fitting to do so, for they
include royalty, the heads of states,
great service commanders. But we
invite you to look carefully at the
next pictures that you see of them,
at their wrists as well as their faces
and clothes. You will notice that
in almost every case they wear a
wrist-watch. That watch will most
likely have been made by Rolex
of Geneva.
We are proud of the service given
by Rolex watches to so many
eminent men throughout the world.
It is scarcely necessary to point
out that the performance of these
watches is, in the highest degree,
accurate and dependable.
A landmark in the history of
Time measurement
for the crime was repugnance over the
monk’s sexual debauchery— not political
motivation. However, in his opening
statement to the jury Zelenko had main-
tained that the Prince plotted the execu-
tion for “pure reasons, because he felt
he would save his country”.
The Prince’s surprising answer con-
cerning his motivation came at a point
in the trial when Zelenko was trying to
establish the alleged inaccuracy of the
CBS drama, which gave the Prince’s
sole motive as his concern over the
monk’s lechery. Zelenko tried three dif-
ferent questions in an attempt to get the
Prince to agree that he was politically
motivated but in each case received a
negative response.
In her brief appearance on the witness
stand, Princess Irina said she had never
met Rasputin, nor had played any part
consciously or otherwise in the assassina-
tion. She stated she was in the Crimea,
recovering from influenza, when the
assassination occurred.
Then the trial was suspended briefly
this week after the Prince collapsed on
the witness stand during sharp cross-
examination concerning the key point of
the suit whether or not he had used
his wife as sexual bait for Rasputin.
“I am sorry, I must leave now,” the
Prince said weakly, interrupting further
questioning. He seemed to be weeping
as court attendants helped him from the
stand. A physician administered oxygen
to the trembling old man and he was
taken by ambulance to his hotel room,
where, by this time, Princess Irina was
also in bed, suffering from a recurrence
of pain in her injured hip and exhaustion.
The collapse of the Prince came after
a half-hour of gruelling examination by
Eldridge, who was unsuccessful in getting
an answer from the witness as to the
“ruse” he used to lure Rasputin to the
cellar of the palace. Three times the
Prince said he either did not hear the
question or he did not understand the
translation in French. Finally Eldridge
picked up a copy of “Lost Splendour”
and read this passage from the Prince’s
account of the slaying: “I was ashamed
of the despicable deceit and the horrible
trickery to which I was obliged to resort.”
Eldridge tried to elicit an answer from
the Prince as to the nature of the
“deceit” and “trickery” but the replies
were vague and unresponsive. Finally the
lawyer asked: “Isn’t it a fact that you
were ashamed because you were using
your wife to get Rasputin to come to
your home that night?” “I told you
already about my wife,” the Prince re-
plied in a low, agitated voice, “I am
dizzy. My head hurts.” He stumbled
from the stand into the arms of the
attendant.
The Master Mind
Behind the Great Train Robbery
By GORDON HAWKINS
The story, broadcast by Moscow Radio, that the British Secret Service planned
and directed Britain’s £2i million (£A34 million) Great Train Robbery might, if
true, go far to retrieve their somewhat battered reputation.
With two of the principals never
captured, two already escaped from pri-
son and £2,295,150 still missing, it is not
surprising that there should be curiosity
about one whose audacity and impunity
appear unrivalled even in the annals of
fictional crime.
Not that there is really a shortage of
information. Indeed the files of English
newspapers at the time of the raid and
subsequent books on the subject provide
an almost embarrassing amount of it.
It was held variously to have been the
work of the Irish Republican Army, of
Billy Hill (a former criminal, now the
owner of a number of thriving business
enterprises), and of a mysterious baronet
whose Mayfair parties the police were
said to be attending. From his yacht in
Cannes, where he was entertaining
friends, Hill, denying that he was in any
way involved in the train robbery,
threatened legal action against anyone
implicating him; and his name dropped
out of the case. Nor were the IRA or the
mysterious baronet heard of again.
But master-mind stories persisted and
some of them published in serious and
reputable newspapers were quite explicit
and circumstantial. Thus, within a week
of the robbery, on August 11, 1963,
Peter Gladstone-Smith in the London
“Sunday Telegraph” announced that
“Detectives investigating the Great Train
Robbery yesterday know the identity of
the criminal who masterminded the
£2,613,784 raid. He is a miser and lives
alone in one room at Brighton. His home
has been searched and he is being
watched. There is not enough evidence
yet to arrest him. This man has a flair for
the most ingenious type of crime. He
works with infinite care and patience to
prepare a plan which is perfect in every
detail. He is known to the underworld by
a nickname, travels widely, and meets
other criminals in the clubs which they
frequent. He has a criminal record but no
convictions for more than twenty years.”

TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine Study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

Some months later, whilst police invest
tigations were still in progress, Anthony
Lejeune gave readers of “The Sunday
Times” for December 15, 1963, another
description of the “Brain behind the
Great Train Robbery”. “The principal
planner,” said Lejeune, “is know:: to be
‘an intellectual’ and speaks with a soft
Cockney accent. He is tall, in his thirties
and habitually wears horn-rimmed
glasses.”
The fullest portrait, however, appeared
in the first full-length book on the sub-1
ject, “The Great Train Robbery” (1964)|
by ex-Detective-Superintendent John Gos-i
ling, former head of Scotland Yard’s'
Ghost Squad, and Dennis Craig, a journ-
alist. In it Gosling claims to have actually
discussed the robbery on the telephone
with the master mind,‘ Johnnie Rainbow.
According to Gosling Rainbow was once
one of the most dedicated officers in the
British Regular Army and the holder of
both a Military Medal and a Military
Cross. Gambling losses resulted ulti-
mately in Rainbow’s being cashiered in
1957 for misappropriating regimental
funds. Subsequently this “strongly built,
fair-headed Scot with an accent which
years of travel had neutralised” turned
to crime. With his “air of elegance and
breeding ... his cold blue eyes and the
hidden threat ir his calmly authorita-
tive manner” he made “a superb under-
world operator”. Rainbow is said to have
“conceived. planned and brilliantly
directed” not only the train robbery but
also the London Airport pay robbery in
November. 1962, in which £62,500 was
stolen, of which, incidentally, not a
penny has ever been recovered.
“The Mind ”
A more allusive and attenuated version
of the master-mind story appeared this
year in Peta Fordham’s “The Robber’s
Tale”. Mrs Fordham, a journalist whose
barrister husband was one of the defence
counsel in the case, is said, like Gosling,
to have “unique contacts”. The "Mind”,
she says, is “a highly intelligent man who
was (and still is) an uncrowned intellec-
tual king of the underworld. I do not
know his present name, but I could, at a
pinch, identify him. It is, however, not
my secret to reveal.” She goes on to say
that he is not solely a criminal but earns
a profitable living from non-criminal
sources and adds “one strange thing is
that he is entirely ungreedy”. Apparently
“he likes a good job well done” and “like
a chess player, he likes to work out a
theoretical coup in advance”. In this
case, although he conceived the plan for
the robbery with its “breakdown into
exquisitely small detail yet which com-
bined into one integrated whole was
its distinction”, he subsequently lost in-
terest in it. “Gradually the plan became
almost anathema to the original planner.
His love for his brainchild turned to

indifference. Anyone who wanted it
could have it: he was no longer inter-
ested.” Unlike Gosling’s Johnnie Rain-
bow, who was an active participant
throughout, he took no part at all in the
execution of his master plan.
Like ex-Detective-Superintendent Gos-
ling, Mrs Fordham is disappointed with
the police attitude, although she admits
that her man is “technically ... in the
clear”. “For some reason or other,” she
says, “the police who must know all this
story —or at the very least, a good por-
tion of it —refuse to admit to a master
mind. It is difficult to know why they
take this line, especially as it is fairly
obvious . . .”
A parable
VTow one of the most striking features
of this sequence of stories is the way
in which the figure of the master criminal
becomes more and more elusive and im-
material. Billy Hill is a real person, a
notorious ex-gang leader and power in
London’s post-war underworld with a
substantial criminal record. Peter Glad-
stone-Smith’s Brighton miser also had a
record but no recent convictions. Ex-
Detective-Superintendent Gosling’s John-
nie Rainbow had never been in the hands
of the police, who had no fingerprints or
photographs of him on the files. More-
over, few members of the gang could
identify him. Finally, Mrs Fordham’s
“Mind” comes into the story only to
conceive the plan and is heard of no
more. The police, for their part, have
persistently denied the existence of a
master mind.
It is all oddly reminiscent of a parable
told some years ago by the English philo-
sopher Professer Anthony Flew in dis-
cussing the existence of God. It ran as
follows: Two explorers come upon a
jungle clearing. One says, “Some gard-
ener must tend this plot.” The other dis-
agrees, “There is no gardener.” So they
pitch tents and set a watch. No gardener
is ever seen. Perhaps he is an invisible
gardener. So they set up a barbed wire
fence. They electrify it. They patrol with
bloodhounds. But no shrieks suggest
that some intruder has received a shock,
no movements of the wire betray an in-
visible climber; the bloodhounds never
give tongue. Yet the first explorer still
maintains that there is a gardener, invis-
ible, intangible, insensible to electric
shocks, who has no scent and makes no
sound. The second explorer, however,
remains sceptical and begins to wonder
how an invisible, intangible, eternally
elusive gardener differs from an imagin-
ary gardener or even from no gardener
at all . . .
Perhaps the “New York Times” had
something when it expressed the hope
that “the imperturbable James Bond”
had been put on the case.

nounced, even while the Statutes Re-
vision Committee was hearing submis-
sions, that ne had no intention of holding
the Bill back.
One Wellington story has it that the
Prime Minister's anxiety to push the Bill
through at all costs stems directly from
a blazing row he had with Lord Thom-
son during the Commonwealth Prime
Ministers’ Conference in London last
June. Their meeting then was a sequel
to Lord Thomson's bid in early 1964
to enter the daily newspaper field in this
country: his attempt foundered between
Government intervention—the threat of
retrospective legislation or some form of
Press licensing to exclude him should
he succeed in taking over “The
Dominion”, Wellington's morning news-
paper—and the quiet move across the
Tasman of Australian Rupert Murdoch.
The News Media Bill is specific in
its protection of the present 20 per
cent Murdoch shareholding in “The
Dominion”: it says that where news-
papers exceed 5000 in circulation, 80
per cent of shares must be retained by
New Zealanders.
Since his failure to enter the daily
newspaper field here, Lord Thomson has
repeatedly made it clear—in Press pro-
nouncements and television interviews—-
that he would like to supply New
Zealanders with a quality Sunday paper
comparable with his own “Sunday
Times” in London; he has also, to allay
local fears, promised complete New
Zealand control of editorial policy. His
interest in this project has steadily in-
creased, if anything: in September he
began airmailing copies of the “Sunday
Times” free to all NZ members of
parliament. But the News Media Bill
was already on its way; and its intro-
duction in Parliament coincided with an
orgy of self-congratulation on the part
of the metropolitan Press. Much of this
came oddlv from newspapers which are
normally in favor of outside competition
for all other NZ-owned industry.
To understand the background to
public anxiety here, and the surprising
amount of goodwill towards Lord Thom-
son, it is necessary to know that from
Cape Reinga in the north to Stewart
Island in the south New Zealanders read,
under difteienr mastheads, virtually the
same newspaper morning and afternoon.
Parish pump items may differ, but even
editorial comment is usually inter-
changeable The monopoly of the exist-
ing metropolitan Press there is only
one morning and one evening paper in
any New Zealand city is tight and
complete; such competition as exists is
only at the margins of circulation areas.
(Thus the major fear about Lord Thom-
son's first b:d: he might have made “The
Dominion" a national daily based in
Wellington.)
This has been the situation in the
country for upwards of 30 years; in
the meantime more and more indepen-
dent provincial newspapers have gone
under from metropolitan competition,
been bought up and closed down. Plainly,
any relief trom the situation would have
to come from outside: from a Lord
Thomson, say. or possibly a roving
Murdoch. According *o the evidence of
the editor of the “New Zealand Herald”
before the Statutes Revision Committee,
it would now cost £5 million (NZ) to
establish a new metropolitan newspaper
here. That kind of capital doesn't exist in
the country.
The shortcomings of such a non-com-
petitive Press have been obvious, and
increasingly obvious, over the past ten
years. No individual NZ newspaper has
—or is permitted to have, under joint
agreement—a permanent representative
cabling back reports from outside the
country. (A tiny provincial newspaper
was collectively reprimanded two or
three years ago for attempting to contact
Khrushchev—by telephone—on its own
initiative.) And the NZ Press as a whole
(through the New Zealand Press As-
sociation, which is serviced solely by
Reuter) has no full-time man in Wash-

Even in neighboring Australia, cover-

Reuter men for whom this country is a
part-time concern, as is the case in Lon-
don. By contrast, however, any touring
All Black Rugby team in England, South
Africa or Australia has an army of NZ
sportswriters in tow. Thus lack of over-
seas representation is less a matter of
expense than of apathy. That this
country is often literally starved for
adequate coverage of the outside world
is suggested by the relatively fantastic
demand for newsweeklies. (Printed in
Auckland, “Time” sells over 30,000 to
2\ million New Zealanders as against
just over 60,000 to 12 million Aus-
tralians.)
If the shortcomings ended there, that
might be sad enough; it might all be ex-
plained by this country’s insularity. But
apathy and lack of competition is re-
flected in domestic events too fire,
accident and court news apart. An ex-
plosive domestic story sometimes goes
begging or. the doorstep of newspaper
offices with ou t
effect were it
not for the odd
independent and
(by N Z stan-
dards) mildly
sensational week-
ly one wonders just how r uch this
country might pride itself on being free
of civic and civil service corruption. A
classic instance of what happens to news
here: when the Lawson “hormone” quins
were born in Auckland, citizens of this
city learned about use of the hormone
from the London Press, whose reports
were reprinted here.
On another level, the Press here has few
cultural pretensions, and this is possibly
just as well. With the dignified Christ-
church “Press” excepted, the country’s
few literary pages are a bad joke. Review
books are thrown out by guess and by
God among the staff: there are seldom
outside contributors, and even then only
one or two of any literary note. The two
largest circulation dailies in the country
Auckland's clip reviews, even of
New Zealand books, from the English
Press. Perhaps the most remarkable
example of this was on the appearance
a few years ago of Antony Alpers’ dis-
tinguished biography of Katherine Mans-
field. By a New Zealander, about a
famous New Zealander, the book was
reviewed in one paper by Miss Marg-
hanita Laski of London, where of course
the review originally appeared. And yet
these are precisely the same newspapers
which have claimed, in face of the
Thomson threat, to be free of colonial
or London-based attitudes.
It would possibly be fair to say that
the average NZ newspaper reader re-
mains ignorant of the national cultural
revolution which has overtaken his
country since the war. When Colin
McCahon, perhaps New Zealand’s most
significant painter, presents new work,
his exhibition may be reviewed a week
late; or not at all.
In perhaps only one field does the NZ
Press really excel itself: in its coverage
of sport, and horse-racing in particular.
The pride that clearly goes into sports
pages is seldom seen elsewhere.
The profession itself has suffered. The
drift into public relations, normal any-
where, is here more a stampede. The
characteristic New Zealand journalist has
the capacity to string together a com-
petent court report, but rarely has a
chance for anything more ambitious; if
he stays long enough in the profession
ambition will anyway soon dry up with
initiative. He is unlikely ever to have a
column of his own; only one daily in
the country features regular individual
columnists. By-lines are few anywhere,
and there is correspondingly no incentive
for pride in individual work. Mental
lethargy is perhaps the distinguishing
characteristic of
the NZ news-
paperman, if he
has remained
long in the pro-
fess i o n. The
chances are, for
example, that he will have read no
further into the literature of his own
country than the best-selling Barry
Crump. He will probably not have
looked at what has happened to New
Zealand history since he left school 10,
20 or 30 years ago: the work of such
historians as Professors Keith Sinclair
and W. H. Oliver will have passed him
by; likewise the contributions to local
knowledge cf such political scientists as
Professor Robert Chapman.
For all its apathy, though, the NZ
Press has just survived the uneasiest 18
months of its entire history. It hasn’t
been all Lord Thomson's doing. Just over
a year ago, perhaps partly in retaliation
for Press criticism of itself, the New
Zealand Broadcasting Corporation quietly
introduced a weekly ten-minute pro-
gramme on the Press into its television
news service. As its first critic, the NZBC
used novelist and ex-newsman lan Cross:
for six months Cross hammered weekly
at the inadequacies of the Press both
nationally and internationally.
A fervent nationalist himself, Cross
pleaded for a genuinely New Zealand
Press, in which might be found a realistic
New Zealand view of the world. The
programme had one immediate effect:
stories in praise of the new feature by
staff television critics were killed by the
daily Press, and newspaper proprietors
were said to have made representations
to the NZBC.
Overhauled and restaffed three yean
ago, the NZBC news service has shown
the way by example as well as criticism.
Though the bulk of its television news
coverage is still devoted to visual trivia,
its newsmen have time and again—in
tiny studios, with absurdly inadequate
resources—produced journalism in depth
seemingly beyond the capacity of the
average NZ newspaper. One such pro-
gramme, recently, was on the touchy
relations between Church and State in
this country —something the Press has
virtually left alone, apart from straight

statements. More than that: the NZBC
has commented on international affairs
in depth at admirable speed.
More recently there has been the
Sunday newspaper upheaval. But it
now seems likely that the pioneer “Sun-
day News’’ will be squeezed out of the
market in the three major cities. Under-
standably, both “Sunday News” and its
sister “NZ I ruth” have been in vehement
opposition to the News Media Bill.
But opposition has not been confined
to those with interests immediately
threatened by the mushroom growth
of local monopoly. The independent
“Waikato Times”, largest provincial
newspaper in the country, has thrown
its weight behind 30 suburban and small-
town newspapers who have declared
themselves against the Government on
the issue, at -east nine of them dissident
members of the Newspaper Proprietors’
Association. Said the “Times” editorially:
“We find the Bill repugnant . . the Bill
enables an effective gag to be put upon
the Press at large at any time by any
Government which has the owners of the
major dailies at its beck and call.”
Ooughly the same line was taken by
the New Zealand Journalists’ As-
sociation in its submissions to the
Statutes Revision Committee. After
hearing evidence from Mr Dave Baum-
field, former president of the NZJA, the
Under-Secretary of Finance, Mr R. D.
Muldoon, called the journalists’ sub-
missions “picturesque and extravagant”.
He used the word “extravagant” again
to describe the submissions of 52 Auck-
land lawyers on the Bill; but the law'yers
were later backed by the president of
the Auckland Law Society (and other
lawyers elsewhere) who commended their
initiative and said the society had not
been given time to take action as a
whole. (There had been only seven days’
warning about the contents of the Bill.)
The president of the NZ Federation of
Labor, Mr T. E. Skinner, apparently
had no concern about accusations of
extravagance: he claimed the Govern-
ment was “Russianising” New Zealand.
When the Bill made its premature re-
appearance in Parliament, Labor opposi-
tion, earlier faint-hearted, was in full
cry: clearly the Bill has given Labor its
first major tactical advantage in Parlia-
ment for a year and, if it chooses to ride
the current of opinion in the country,
repeal of the Bill could well be an elec-
tion issue in 1966. In those circum-
stances, New Zealand’s daily Press could
easily be in the situation journalists have
officially predicted: being forced to
oblige the Government of the day or
else.


OVERSEAS
Britain First
(Extracts from the “Drop East of Suez” speech by Mr. Enoch Powell, Conservative M.P.)
To defend this nation’s existence and
its continuity is the one object
which a Tory places uncondition-
ally above all others. That is easily said.
But before the determination can be
turned into policy, we have to ask, and
to answer, a number of crucial questions.
In the first place, what do we mean
by “the nation”? I will say what I believe
we mean. We mean the United Kingdom.
Whatever other meanings the words “the
British Nation” can have and do have,
this is the sense in which we use them
when Her Majesty’s Government in the
United Kingdom and the Parliament of
the United Kingdom take measures for
security and defence. Whatever obliga-
tions and commitments we have besides
the ultimate reason and the ultimate
justification for those commitments is
that we hold them to be necessary or
advantageous for the defence of the
United Kindom.
The United Kingdom is a European
power. True, it has characteristics, pro-
foundly relevant to defence, which make
it different from any other European
power. But if the rest of Europe suc-
cumbed to an enemy, the safety of
these islands would be even more pre-
carious in the future than when that
event has threatened or occurred in the
past. Therefore, an alliance which can
successfully defend Western Europe
against attack from the east the only
present direction from which danger is
apprehended is central to our defence
policy. Forces and material which are
needed for the purposes of that alliance
have an overriding claim on the resources
which we can devote to our defence,
overriding with only one proviso, that no
commitment be entered into which would
irrevocably deny us all possibility of in-
dependent action to deter an enemy or
to maintain our own existence, however
unforeseeable the circumstances may
now be in which that might be necessary.
This means, among other things, that
our right to control the use of our own
strategic nuclear weapon must be re-
tained to the limit of our ability, at least
until military and political circumstances
are profoundly different from what they
are today. It is the merest casuistry to
argue that if the weapon and the means
of using it are purchased in part, or even
altogether, from another nation, there-
fore the independent right to use it has
no reality.
So far I have spoken about the sup-
reme national interest, the defence of this
realm. What are the other national in-
terests which though still secondary to
that, might claim to share the resources
we allocate to defence? One that is often
mentioned is trade and access to raw
materials.
Often, however, these are seen as
merging in another interest, that of as-
signing limits to the extension, outside
Europe, of the thing we call Communism.
We do not, of course, mean Communism
literally: for Communism is an abstract
theory, and you do not shoot theories
with bullets. We mean the Russian empire
and, in the second place, the Chinese
empire, both which we apprehend might
threaten Europe and thus ourselves by
commanding the adjacent continents of
Asia and Africa.
This generation has twice narrowly
escaped destruction at the hands of a
military empire which possessed only a
private, nationalistic creed. We cannot
take lightly the danger of military empires
armed with an ideology that claims to
appeal to all mankind. It is in the solemn
presence of that danger that the British
government and people have nevertheless
to weigh two great propositions with the
utmost candor. One proposition is this.
Assuming that Western military power
could limit, or be a factor in limiting, the
extension of the Russian and Chinese in-
fluence in Asia and Africa, we should
still have to measure the practical effect
of British military effort against the size
of the resources it demands and the con-
sequences of diverting them for other
pressing uses defensive as well as
economic.
The other proposition is this. How-
ever much we may do to safeguard and
reassure the new independent countries
in Asia and Africa, the eventual limits
of Russian and Chinese advance in those
directions will be fixed by a balance of
forces which will itself be Asiatic and
African. The two Communist empires
are already in a state of mutual antagon-
ism, but every advance by one or the
other calls into existence countervailing
forces, sometimes nationalist in char-
acter, sometimes expansionist, which will
ultimately check it.
We have to reckon with the harsh
fact that the attainment of this eventual
equilibrium of forces may at some point
be delayed rather than hastened by
Western military presence. These are the
great issues in Europe and in the world
which any defence policy worth the
name must weigh. ,i>-
God and Man
in New York
By NORAH SAYRE
Heaven’s gift to liberals, William
F. Buckley, the wealthy 39-year-
old Catholic editor of the
“National Review”, is the conservative
candidate in the New York mayoral
battle. Buckley, who is supported on the
unfolded wings of Barry Goldwater and
Mrs Clare Booth Luce, is a gift for two
reasons: first, because he’s so luxuriantly
extreme as to delight those who oppose
WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY
him, and, second,
because some of his
criticism of New
York’s footless gov-
ernment is just.
During a recent
television debate,
viewers who dis-
relish Mr Buckley’s
beliefs rocked with
joy as he made Re-
publican candidate
Lindsay and Demo-
crat i c candidate
Beame seem equally
imprecise. (Lately
they have been repeating one another,
or else bickering on such miniature
points that they deserve Buckley’s
reproof that their differences “are
biological, not political”.) On my set,
the image was distorted, so that each
candidate’s doppelganger stared over his
shoulder. Yet the picture was sometimes
mysteriously clarified when Mr Buck-
ley’s battered elfin face appeared
perhaps it was celestial intervention.
Buckley once seemed more formid-
able than he does now. In 1951 he
published “God and Man at Yale”, an
assault on his university for indoctrinat-
ing students with liberal views (includ-
ing the infiltration of Keynesian econ-
omics). With his brother-in-law, L.
Brent Bozell, he produced an intricate
defence of McCarthy in 1954; in “Up
From Liberalism” (1959) he explained
that the liberals rather than the in-
vestigators were responsible for the
derangement of the McCarthy period.
Anti - UN, grateful for General
Franco’s victory, Buckley has some pre-
dictable obsessions. But the fascination
lies in following his whimsical erection
of political inconsistencies or what
one observer has called “the palace of
fallacies”. He is a prince of paradox.
Some of the internal contradictions
are familiar; for example, the Right wing
seeks “to avoid war: and the surest way
to avoid war is to assert our willingness
to wage it . . .” He deprecates “the
attempt to conduct a dialectic between

Fast and West, between Communism and

s;. perstition, defended today by the
reactionaries who cluster about the
American Civil Liberties Union, that the
free exchange of opposite ideas mid-
wives the truth.” Most baffling of all is
his attitude towards Negroes: he seems
to favor civil rights and States’ rights,
disapproves of the 1954 Supreme Court
decision, yet appears to back integration.
He says that “individuals,” rather than
the government, “must make a special
personal effort to help Negroes achieve
economic progress. - ’ Yet labor unions
should be penalised for their practice
of racial discrimination.
William Buckley is offering himself
as mayor in order to represent the
800,000 New Yorkers who voted for
Goldwater hence to consolidate the
conservatives in the city and because
he hopes to blunt the chances of Lindsay,
who is “unsexing the Republican Party
by flitting off with the Democratic
majority.” At first his candidacy
(announced under a painting called “The
Merry Company”) was commedia del’
arte.
Lately his efforts have been more
earnest. Proclaiming that “there are
rational limits to politics, and that one
tends to be better off where government
is devoted to dismantling, rather than
establishing, artificial privileges,” he
opposes a civilian review board to
investigate police brutality, would like
to cut welfare costs by moving some
recipients outside of New York, and
thinks that the city's economy would
profit by limiting its residency, excluding
numbers of job-seekers who come here
“due to some twitch of touristic fancy.”
Recently he has reeled away from urban
affairs to rebuke Lindsay for being
“dangerously ignorant of the Communist
problem,” and “recklessly negligent of
the problem of internal security.”
Buckley's non-conservative audience is
disappointed.
They are less intrigued by his pro-
grammes or his admiration for the
House Committee on Un-American
Activities than in watching him perform
as a torpedo-fish in the spirit which
moved him (when he was six) to write
to George V, challenging Britain to pay
her war debt; to state that “1 would
rather be governed by the first 2000
people in the Boston phone book than
by the faculty of Harvard”; and to an-
nounce that: You can t walk from one
end of New York to the other without
standing a good chance of losing your,
wallet, your maidenhead, or your life.”
Last month a Lindsay aide charged
that conservatives had shattered win-
dows, cut and jammed telephone lines,
destroyed mail, threatened Lindsay
volunteers, and personally “infiltrated”
Lindsay headquarters. Buckley retorted
that “crackpots”, not conservatives,
were responsible, adding, “John Lindsay
has nothing to fear from crackpots. He
has a great deal to fear from rational
and intelligent men.” Buckley has re-
pudiated the John Birch Society, and
described the American Nazi Party as
“two dozen swastika-ed cretins who go
about plying their pathology in the fever-
swamps of the crazy-Right.”
Yet his problem, like Goldwater's, is
attracting vehement hominy-grits fan-
tasists, whose habit is to make state-
ments like “98 out of 100 Negroes have
syphilis,” and then to insist sincerely that
they read it in the “New York Times”,
where, of course, it never appeared.
Buckley may not want this following,
but he has it. The window-smashers
were surely not on his staff, but they
were probably people who will vote for
him.

Cynical Equation
Zionists and neo-Nazis
By ISI LEIBLER
M embers of the UN Assembly’s
Social Humanitarian and Cultural
Committee are discussing an act
by the Soviet representative which could
rank as a major scandal in Western
Communist Parties comparable with last
year's upheaval over the notorious anti-
Semitic Kichko book.
A resolution co-sponsored by Brazil
and the United States called on all States
to “condemn anti-Semitism and take
action for its speedy eradication in ter-
ritories subject to their jurisdiction”. To
the astonishment of participants, the
Soviet delegate submitted an amendment
that could easily have been a paraphrase
of Eric Butler’s “International Jew”
thesis. The Soviet spokesman moved that
the resolution be altered to read “con-
demn anti-Semitism, Zionism, neo-
Nazism and all other forms of the policy
and ideology of colonialism, national
and race hatred and exclusiveness”.
This Soviet stunt at the UN only
serves to highlight the sham of the
alleged religious and cultural concessions
granted to the Jews by the Soviet authori-
ties in recent months. The loudly pro-
claimed so-called “concessions” were
only applied as a sop to stifle the ever-
increasing crescendo of public protests
from wide sections of Western public
opinion against Soviet anti-Jewish dis-
crimination. The “concessions” did not
even scratch the surface of the basic
issues confronting Soviet Jewry.
The Soviet Union's behavior at the
United Nations strongly suggests that
it is even becoming exasperated with pro-
tests and appeals regarding Soviet Jewry
from Western Communist and pro-Com-
munist bodies. This would create further
tensions. Unlike the Stalinist period
when, even at the cost of destroying
themselves, Western Communists meekly
submitted to acting as an extension of
the Soviet Foreign Office, the reality of
the Sino-Soviet split has shown that
they need not necessarily follow the old
pattern.
This was recently highlighted at an
international Communist conference
where the Jewish question also created
problems. The reliable London “Jewish
Observer and Middle East Review”
carries a report on a conference of Arab
Communist Parties which took place
last month at Salzburg, Austria. It was
presided over by the veteran Syrian
Communist, Khaled Bakdash.
Bakdash claimed that the central cause
of unrest and chaos in the Arab world
was “one man; Gamul Abdul Nasser and
his misguided followers that have turned
Egypt into a police State.” Bakdash
bitterly attacked the Soviet Union for
having given encouragement to Nasser
and other Arab leaders to turn on their
comrades, persecute them, and in some
cases, kill them. Bakdash clearly implied
that the Arab Communists were being
made the sacrificial goats for Soviet
foreign polny objectives purely motivated
by expediency.
The final resolution decided to fully
support the anti - Nasser Egyptian
National Front Movement, despite the
strongest opposition from the Soviet
“observers”. Surprisingly enough, this
Arab Communist conference also sup-
ported the “national” Israeli Communist
Party, headed by Mikunis, a Jew, and
condemned the break-away pro-Nasser
Israeli Communist splinter group headed
by Toubi. an Arab. To top it off, the
resolution supported the initiative of
Tunisia's President Bourguiba for a
Palestinian settlement.
These events also highlight the com-
plexity of the Communist problem re-
garding the Jewish issue. The question
of Soviet Jewry, Israel and Zionism are
more or less accidental surface manifes-
tations of the much more fundamental
issues affecting the relationship between
the Soviet Union and Western Com-
munist Parties. These problems are
primarily centred on the question of
further de-Stalinisaticn and liberalisa-
tion, and a desire by many Western
Communist groups for greater autonomy.
Whether the plight of Soviet Jewry
will be ameliorated as a result of con-
frontation on the more fundamental
questions is difficult to predict. The
United Nations episode suggests that,
when the chips are down if foreign policy
interests are involved, the Soviet Union
will even break witn the anti-Chinese
Communist Parties in the West.
The impact of these developments on
the Communist Party of Australia may
be significant. The CPA has a long, dog-
matic and Stalinist record but, despite
even recent vacillations, it has begun
assuming an independent role. With
regard to the question of Soviet Jewry,
the CPA has gene further on record in
officially condemning Soviet anti-Jewish
discrimination than any other Western
Communist Party. The extent to which it
will be prepared to publicly condemn the
most recent Soviet act of anti-Jewish
defamation will be an acid test of its
preparedness to reallv confront the issue.
The Vietcong’s POWs
From WENDELL S. M ERICK
TTnited States Intelligence has a
fair idea where some, if not all,
captured Americans are being held by
the Vietcong. Two rescue attempts are
known to have been made. There may
have been others. According to some
sources, the factors restraining the US
from making attempts to free American
prisoners involve the lives of the captives
themselves and of the rescuers.
The only acknowledged attempts were
made on December 23, and December
25, 1964. In both instances, US heli-
copters spread a cloud of non-lethal but
immobilising gas over areas in the
Mekong Delta and in War Zone C
while Vietnamese troops pushed towards
suspected Vietcong camp sites.
These two rescue operations, inci-
dentally, were the first two instances of
the US military using gas. Since then,
Intelligence has received countless re-
ports of the whereabouts of American
prisoners. Most describe the captives
being displayed in isolated villages as a
travelling carnival would show off prized
animals. There is feeling here that the
Vietcong bring the prisoners out in the
open from time to time for two reasons.
One, to humble them before the Viet-
namese villagers and to demonstrate how
the “American aggressors” are being
humbled, and two, in hopes perhaps
that rescue attempts will be made.
The idea is that American or govern-
ment forces would swoop down on an
area where American captives have been
seen and tumble into an ambush. This
is one of the reasons rescue operations
are regarded as risky. The question is
whether it is worth risking a battalion
to free one or two men. The second
consideration perhaps is more pertinent.
The military might well be willing to
take a chance on an ambush. But if the
rescuers got anywhere near the captors
and captives and cornered them so there
was no escape for the Vietcong, it is
felt a certainty the prisoners would be
killed on the spot.
That was the reason behind the use of
gas in the December rescue operations
—to immobilise the captors long enough
for the troops to reach the scene before
the prisoners could be executed. Only
one prisoner has escaped the Vietcong,
and he has not been allowed to tell all
the details of how he did it.

Memo to the
Attorney-General
If you REALLY want law reform
By PHILLIP ROBINSON
Law reform has suddenly become popular. There are apparently votes in it
and both the NSW Government and Opposition are making at least one aspect of
law reform, the continued existence of the jury in road-accident cases, a live issue in
the forthcoming Bondi by-election. Public discussion of law reform is welcome but,
unfortunately, the topic tends to get discussed in terms of political advantage rather
than social and legal values, and the true need for reform tends to be lost in the
salvoes of political debate.
We are perhaps not a nation of sun-
burnt Anzacs but we are a nation of car-
users. In 1964 there was one car on
the road for every 3.2 persons in Aus-
tralia. The total number of motor
vehicles on the road numbered almost
four million. If you are a family man
you may care to think over a recent
statistical projection which shows that,
if one took an average family of five,
during their lifetime one member of
such a family would be killed or
seriously injured as a result of a motor
traffic accident.
The basic way that society has adapted
to the problem of the motor traffic
accident has been to utilise the existing
machinery of the law as a means of re-
distributing some of society’s resources
in favor of persons injured or the family
of those killed. This is what a verdict
of damages in an accident case really
achieves.
The real problem that faces society
today is whether this process of social
re-adjustment ought to be handled by
traditional mean’s or whether some
radical reform in the field is called for.
If the second solution is the real solution
any tinkering around with the present
arrangements whether it involves the
abolition of juries or the introduction of
proportional fault does not really amount
to any reform at all but merely a patch-
ing of a system which society has out-
grown.
At present every action involving
personal injuries brought in court has
three characteristics all of which, it is
suggested, need review. The first such
characteristic is that the action in form
is brought by a series of formal and
even archaic legal steps which were
originally designed to narrow the legal
and to some extent factual issues between
the parties. In New South Wales it can
be safely said that these legal steps,
called pleadings, have never been pro-
perly reviewed and indeed the necessary
legal formalities which have to be under-
taken have changed little for more than
a century.
The second characteristic is that the
whole proceedings turn on a notion of
“fault”. The plaintiff must prove that
the fault lies in the defendant. Unless
“fault” is proved there is no legal justi-
fication for transferring the loss from the
place in which it was sustained, i.e., from
the plaintiff, to anyone else.
The third characteristic is that the
proceedings conclude, if successful, with
the award of a lump sum by way of
damages. The principle is that “full and
fair compensation” must be paid for all
that the plaintiff has suffered or lost.
Before the court such an action is
still treated as an action between two
parties as if both were private citizens,
and the fiction is maintained that the
One member of each family is
going to be killed or seriously
injured.
funds from which the verdict is paid
together with any necessary admini-
strative costs are still private funds as
if the jury were ordering the defendant
to pay in a personal and individual way.
Since the Motor Vehicles (Third Party
Insurance) Act of 1942 there has
been in NSW compulsory third party
insurance. In form (but in form only)
this resembles ordinary commercial in-
surance against risk but in fact it is, of
course, a sectional tax collected by the
State, or an insurance company as a
licensee of the State, and used as a
pool from which verdicts are paid. Even
in externals it is apparent that it is truly
a tax. It is most frequently paid at the
same time as motor vehicle registration,
often in the same cheque as a combined
sum.
What alternative system can be
proposed? The elaborate machinery of
an action at Common Law is almost
totally unnecessary in motor car
cases. Any case which has compli-

cations which might be assisted by
the formalities of pleading can be sub-
mitted to such procedures if some
appropriate cause is shown. For the rest,
current procedures should simply be
dumped. For all ordinary cases what is
needed is a form of application which
would probably contain some fifteen to
twenty paragraphs dealing with topics
such as full name and address and age
of applicant, capacity in which he sues,
i.e., driver, pedestrian, passenger, etc.,
full name and address of defendant,
capacity in which he is sued —namely as
driver, owner or other circumstances,
occasion of accident, short facts of
direction, speed, etc., list of injuries,
place of treatment, list of disabilities,
particulars of wage loss, particulars of
medical expenses, etc. The form may
need adaptation to meet special cases but
this is no administrative problem. The
defendant should be required to file an
answer which in numbered paragraphs
would admit so many of the paragraphs
as were not in issue, refuse to admit
perhaps those that were in doubt, and
deny those that were essential.
The central reform which sooner or
later will have to be faced is for a
scheme of liability without necessarily
having to prove fault. This has been
traditionally regarded in the legal pro-
fession as a dramatic reform but in fact
the trend of jury decisions over recent
years has in effect carried the now out-
moded concept of “fault” law to a
position not very far removed from the
notion of liability without fault.
In these days of increased traffic con-
gestion the standard of behavior that
society expects of road users must rise.
Transferred into the jury room it means
that juries are increasingly holding defen-
dants responsible for degrees of fault of

even inadvertence which in former years
they would have excused. Similarly, juries
are increasingly tending to ignore the
law’s traditional standards on the question
of contributory negligence. Opponents of
juries tend to treat this as another
example of juries’ irresponsibility but in
the real sense the juries are fulfilling the
law and not ignoring it.
The volume and congestion of traffic
and the pace at which it moves has in-
creasingly given the pedestrian less oppor-
tunity by his own act to avoid dangers
which he is otherwise subject to, and the
tendency has been more and more for the
safety of pedestrians to lie not so much
in their own hands but in the hands of
the increasing number of drivers on the
road. The increased disadvantages of
this situation have been reflected in
juries’ verdicts by a refusal to concede
in very many cases that a pedestrian has
in the real sense contributed towards his
own injury.
Setting law back 25 years
VTow, unfortunately, the elimination of
juries as is proposed in this field will
almost certainly have a directly opposite
effect. Whereas juries by their stringent
interpretation of the duty of care that
lies upon road users have approached the
position of liability without fault, re-
establishment of traditional standards of
care at the hands of judges as against
current standards of care at the hands
of juries could set the substance of the
present law back 25 years. Juries, by
the accumulated effect of thousands of
decisions, carried the content of the law,
though not the letter of it, a long way
beyond what is now proposed in the
name of “reform”. As old precedent
resumes its sway and jury standards
become slowly forgotten, the risk is that
the whole system will atrophy into some-
thing of very much less social utility
than our present system with all its faults.
These considerations are exactly those
motivating quite unprecedented attacks
on the work of the judiciary in the per-
sonal injuries field in the United King-
dom.
What are the objections to a scheme
of liability without fault? A first objec-
tion would be that undeserving persons
would succeed and obtain a verdict.
Should the drunk who lurches out on to
the road into the path of an oncoming
motorist, or the lout playing “chicken”,
or a motorist turning a suburban corner
at 60 m.p.h. recover under such a
scheme? This problem can be shortly
handled in ways that have been tradition-
ally employed in the Workers’ Com-
pensation jurisdiction. Provision can be
made for liability without fault provided
that it can be shown that the plaintiff
received injuries without his own wilful
act or default or without his own serious

and wilful misconduct. Such conduct
would disqualify him.
A further objection might be raised
concerning the position of a driver who,
say, through inadvertence or lack of
driving skill, collects a telegraph pole.
Who could he sue and what should he
recover? Such a driver could be left
outside this scheme but each driver
should be obliged to insure himself
against personal accident by a conven-
tional accident policy.
But the usual criticisms made of the
proposal is that it would be very ex-
pensive. It can be said at once that it
would be considerably more expensive
than present arrangements. How much
more expensive, in this country, has not,
in recent times at any rate, ever been
thoroughly examined, but there is room
for suspicion that it may not be so
expensive as has been assumed. What
would have to be resisted might be
pressure to cut down the notion of full
and fair compensation in favor of some
limited sort of schedule of payments
which occasionally have been proposed,
a proposal which could shortly be
described as injustice for all. For in-
stance, under Workers’ Compensation
legislation an injured worker who loses
a hand at present gets £1950 whatever
his circumstances. This worker might
be a right-handed man aged 65 who
loses his left hand and was working in
a clerical capacity, anyway. To such a
person the sum of £1950 might be some-
thing like adequate compensation for
his loss. On the other hand the injured
worker could be a musician, aged 20,
with a promising future and an already
high rate of income. His loss both
immediately and over the years could
run into tens of thousands of pounds.
The fact is both the degree of pain,
disability and suffering and the degree
of economic loss for what is super-
ficially the same injury varies enor-
mously, and the arbitrary nature of some
sort of schedule simply wreaks in-
justices both ways. It over-compensates
some and under-compensates almost all
the rest.
Speculative lump sums
Ts there any alternative to the present
“lump sum” award of damages? At
present the jury or judge has to award
in a lump sum a round sum of money
which in part compensates the person
injured for his future financial loss. For
instance, a man aged 30 who is em-
ployed as a rigger, making £26 per
week, suffers a permanent injury to his
foot with a result that he can no longer
climb. He is, however, able to find
employment as an ordinary laborer but
his wage is only £2O per week. There
is no medical prospect of any improve-
ment in his condition and it seems
possible that, bearing in mind the sort
of man he is and his limitations, he will
continue to lose about £3OO a year for
the rest of his working life. Consequently
an award of damages is made which
takes into account this future wage loss.
But, of course, the man may die, he
may fall sick, he may become unem-
ployed and because of his disability lose
jobs that he otherwise might have been
able to obtain; money values over the
future years are almost certain to change
so that what was reasonably assessed as
compensation at the beginning of his 30-
odd years of loss might end up being
wholly inadequate at the other end of it.
Again he might chance upon some sort
of light employment which might pay
him more than he would have got as a
rigger. He might even become a
foreman. All these future possibilities
or contingencies as they are known are,
so far as the Court is able, taken into
account, but the result of course must
be simply speculative. It is hard to resist
the logic of the demand that the tribunal
should be given the right to review the
actual loss from time to time so as to
Juries ignore the law;
otherwise the system would
atrophy.
adjust the payment, not on a speculative,
but on a real basis.
The disadvantages of the present lump
sum system operates in other ways. For
instance, a paraplegic can often show in
nursing expenses, medical expenses and
loss of wages a loss of £6O-£7O per week.
At the age of 30 and postulating a Work-
ing life of perhaps another 35 years,
£3OOO a year adds up to a gross sum
of £105,000.
Even allowing for the fact that the
sum can be invested and drawn upon,
the capital sum necessary to return
something like £6O or £7O a week to a
paraplegic may well be of the order of
£60,000 or £70,000. But paraplegics
notoriously often die prematurely from
the onset of infections encouraged by
the condition. If a judge or jury who
is told this therefore chops the amount
of damages down to a figure postulating
a life expectancy of, say, 10 years and
the unfortunate paraplegic lives the full
term as some do, a great injustice has
obviously been done. The alternative is,
of course, to compensate as if the para-
plegic might live an ordinary span. If
in this case the sufferer does die within
a few years, the notable effect of the
verdict is to enrich quite unnecessarily
the beneficiary of his estate. The case
for more flexibility which should include
a power to review the award of damages
still within the principle of “full and
fair compensation” is overwhelming.
Unfit judges
F astly there is the question—in whose
hands should these decisions be? The
proposed “reform” in NSW leaves the
decisions in the hands of judges of the
Supreme Court of New South Wales
both on issues of fact and law. Appoint-
ments to the Supreme Court have of
course never been influenced by the
necessity to appoint people of special
experience in the field of personal in-
juries and their social consequences.
Judges as tribunals of fact have simply
not previously been called upon to make
decisions of fact in these fields. This is
in marked contrast with other specialised
tribunals such as the Workers’ Compen-
sation Commission, industrial tribunals,
land valuation courts, divorce courts
and the like where the specialised nature
of the tribunal has obviously played a
part in the appointments made to it. It is
suggested that the most satisfactory way
of truly reforming the law in this field
involves the appointment of a special
tribunal to deal with its special problems.
Such a tribunal, whose personnel, not
necessarily all lawyers, can be chosen on
the basis of their fitness for the special
task, should be primarily designed to
administer a scheme of liability without
fault coupled with a flexible system of
damages and the right to review them.
Finally it might be asked, what place
juries might have in any such system?
The great function of juries, to keep
the standards of the court abreast of
current community thinking, will have
disappeared or at least diminished with
the abolition of the fault system of
liability. The administrative difficulties
inherent in periodic review of awards on
damages which would involve the re-
assembling of juries from time to time
would appear very formidable indeed.
It would, therefore, be most unlikely
that such a new tribunal would often
need to resort to a jury. This is not to
say that the democratic and egalitarian
qualities which juries have brought to
the administration of the law will not be
missed. It will mean, however, that the
method of administering this field has
been fundamentally reformed so that
juries are abolished, not for the sake of
abolition, but because the problems in
the field have been so treated as to solve
by other specially designed means the
sort of problems that juries habitually
solve for us today. This it is suggested
is something in the nature of true
reform.


LETTERS
From Canberra to Konedobu
SIR. —Your report from Port Moresby,
“Why They Resigned” (8., Oct 16),
raises wider issues. Anyone who has had
occasion to do battle with a Public Ser-
vice Board is sure to have had the im-
pression that he is fighting an unthinking
machine embodying the totality of
Parkinson’s Law. Imagine then the plight
of the public servant in Papua-New
Guinea! Not only has he to contend with
the usual monster but has an even more
menacing and less feeling one as well.
For the Territory public servant is not
merely ruled by the Administration but
by the Department of Territories as well.
The Minister for Territories is to a
large extent administering a government
within a government. Appreciate, then,
the predicament of the Territory public
servant who is tossed from one to the
other with plodding abandon. Nothing
reckless here. Every submission of note
must be considered in Port Moresby
(Konedobu is the name of the adminis-
trative centre) and then in Canberra.
Senior Administration officials spend
hours each week on the direct telephone
line to Canberra. However, the man in
Port Moresby retires to the ever-present
facts of life in Port Moresby. His
superior in Canberra retires to the banks
of Lake Burley Griffin. To him Papua-
New Guinea is just a daytime name.
The Territory public servant who has the
temerity to ask for an increase in salary
must satisfy not only the usual penny-
pinching local bureaucrats but remote
and faceless ones as well. By the time
his reclassification request is reviewed,
the circumstances on which it was based
may well have altered so radically that
the actual submissions are no longer
relevant to his position. This division
of responsibility between Konedobu and
Canberra is, in a sense, Gilbertian (or
Parkinsonian?): a haven for buck-
passers. But in a real sense it is impeding
the progress of Papua-New Guinea and
frustrating its ablest administrators.
The fact is that decisions are ultimately
made in Canberra, where the Department
of Territories seems to view movements
within the Territory as something of an
academic exercise. The sooner there is
a strong centralised Government by
persons directly acquainted with the
Territory the sooner some of the damage
of the past can be partially repaired
and some of the forgotten recommen-
dations implemented. Administration
officials here throw up their hands in
exasperation when they think of
measures, which they regard as impor-
tant, gathering dust in an “Inwards” tray
on the table of an insignificant public
servant in Canberra who has to consult
a map to be sure where a certain part
of the Territory is and who has no idea
of native thinking. Even when the public
servant in question is not “insignificant”,
the latter criticism is generally valid.
Such men on their rare visits to the
Territory remind one of the old English
society matron who, on actually meeting
a group of farm laborers, said, “Oh,
you’re the people of England; I’ve seen
you from the carriage”!
Thus the Canberra bureaucrats “see”
the people of Papua-New Guinea from
their office, the Papua Club or Govern-
ment House. Many of them the
Secretary of the Department of Terri-
tories in particular are extremely busy
men, but it is nonetheless their duty to
make themselves familiar with all phases
of Territory life. By doing so their job
would surely be easier, and their funda-
mental function better facilitated, pro-
vided they captured the “spirit” of the
Territory and sought to understand the
human problems and emotions of its
people, rather than merely viewing the
matter as an exercise in logic.

Four Brigadiers and the CMF
SlR.—The issue of October 23 published
a letter by a serving officer of the ARA
(name withheld) which stated that he
felt compelled to point out several
anomalies which he considered to be in
the article “Four Brigadiers and the
CMF” (8., Oct. 2).
First, may I say that, in my opinion,
both argue incorrectly as if the
fault lay within the Army itself. I do
not believe it does, and I would depre-
cate strongly the suggestions put forward
by some that it is rivalry between the
Regular Army and the CMF that is the
root cause of the situation today, and
that Regular Army officers are intent
on reducing the CMF to impotency. My
research finds to the contrary. I am one
who believes that the reorganisation of
the Army and the reduction in the role
of the CMF was a decision which was
forced on the N Army for two reasons:
(1) Insufficient money for effective
re-equipment, recruitment and training.
(2) The need for a force fully trained
and equipped to move to an area of
danger at short notice.
In respect to (1), the Government
allowed the defence vote to remain
static for too long over a period when
costs, wages, etc., were rising sharply,
with the result that less people could be
employed and less equipment could be
purchased. While this, no doubt, was the
result of the allocation of limited funds
and the priority accorded to the urgent
needs of national development, the Army
had to accept the situation.
In respect to (2), the Army had to
make a decision whether it should have
the most effective force ready at short
notice to serve overseas reasonably well
equipped, or to continue with an organ-
isation that had no effective force to
meet any sudden emergency and, in fact,
which merely maintained an inadequate
ARA and an unsatisfactory CMF. The
Army had insufficient money to do the
things necessary to maintain an effective
ready-to-go force and a CMF which had
a well-trained corps of officers and
NCOs, and an adequate framework to
mobilise on should it be necessary at
short notice. The situation today is the
result of the fact that too much time
was allowed to lapse before the Govern-
ment realised that the situation in South-
East Asia and elsewhere had deteriorated
further and faster than perhaps antici-
pated.
The selective National Service train-
ing placed strains on the strategic force.
Instructors had to be found from Regu-
lar units, thereby leaving them below
strength; commitments were undertaken
in new areas overseas, which again
placed additional strains on the ARA,
with the result that, if the CMF is in-
creased now, the strategic force must
further be depleted. It is hoped that
National Service training may, after a
period, bring a sufficient number of
junior officers and senior NCOs to enable
the CMF to be reorganised more effec-
tively, but, until this happens, I do not
feel that the strategic force can be
depleted any further without most
serious results. I contend that what is
required in Australia, and will continue
to be required, is that an additional
vote is necessary for the CMF, in ad-
dition to that required for the ARA
division.

lift”, or “Miss Smith has a tilt at right
living” (8., Oct. 23). Tut, tut, Miss
Smith, your slips are really showing.
How could you possibly compare clean-
living, vivacious Donna Douglas with
Elizabeth Taylor? Must we accept as the
Australian standard those bedraggled old
film players who change their husbands
almost as frequently as they change their
brassieres? I think not. Here’s a laugh.

Talking Books
SIR. —1 am writing concerning an article
about the Talking Book service to blind
people under the title “It is Spring” (8.,
Oct. 16). The article included the words
“Melbourne withdrew its support”. The
Talking Book Library service "in Vic-
toria, which is operated by this institute
without cost to the blind reader, is ex-
panding rapidly and, in fact, over the
last twelve months 107 different titles
were added to our library. Copies of
each new title are available to blind wel-
fare organisations in each State at a
cost that just covers the expenses of
production.

Dr Ayd and the Pill
SIR. —As one of those present at the
“secret” meeting of the Catholic clergy
with Dr Frank Ayd, I hope you will
permit me to correct some inaccuracies
in the report you published (8., Oct.
23). Your report is so far from what
really happened that one can only specu-
late as to the kind of hearsay on which
it was based.
In the first place the meeting was in
no sense secret. There was no suggestion,
either express or implied, that the pro-
ceedings W'ere confidential. On the con-
trary, one of the audience urged Dr Ayd
to make known as widely as possible in
Australia the things he was saying to
us. Some of us have since discussed his
views with leading medical specialists,
and I for one have no feeling of im-
propriety in doing so. Neither was the
gathering “closed” in any sinister way.
When a recognised expert in some field
visits this country, it is customary for
meetings with various groups to be
arranged so that the expert can address
them on topics of specialised interest. In
this case, as usual, Bishop Freeman ex-
tended an invitation to all the priests of
the Archdiocese of Sydney, and the sub-
ject of the address was, I believe, left
to the speaker to decide. Dr Ayd spoke
as a scientist, and he had a right to do
so, since he is a medical man who,
though primarily a psychiatrist, has given
much study to the subject of fertility
control, and has views on it which, while
obviously open to discussion, are cer-
tainly not unscientific. He did not state
that “any woman who took the pill for
five years would almost certainly become
sterile”. What he did say was that, in his
view, the pill if taken continuously for
five years can cause irreversible atrophy
of the ovaries, but that the rate of
atrophy varies much for different in-
dividuals.
The lecture was not “a quick trot
through pre-Council cliches on the sub-
ject” of contraception. It was a detailed,
systematic and painstaking exposition,
from the viewpoint of gynaecology and
pharmacology, of the mode of action
of the “pill” as seen by the speaker. As
a true scientist, Dr Ayd did not try to
ram his views down the throats of his
hearers, but supported his statements by
what he considered to be solid evidence.
There were about two hundred priests in
the hall; to my knowledge priests are
not given to treating speakers (especially
alleged experts) tenderly; and these par-
ticular men were neither “captive” nor
muzzled. Yet of all those present, only
one dissentient voice was heard, and
this not on medical grounds. Admittedly
we were not medical men, but neither
were we naive nor utterly uninformed.
As one who has a high regard for The
Bulletin, I submit with regret that this
report was not in the highest traditions
of a great paper. In particular, Dr Ayd’s
views on the effectiveness of rhythm,
though contested by some, are shared
by a respectable body of medical experts.
And even if the speaker saw fit, in the
course of his remarks, to make a per-
sonal reference to his own family of 12,
it ill became The Bulletin to echo it
in this particular context.

“A Big, Mad Gesture...”
Middy at Pop
at the Op
By JAN SMITH
Sydney journalist Miss Jillian
Robertson had requested the
pleasure of the company of some
thousand people at her party in the far-
from-partylike tundras of the Opera
House.
By the extension of what must have
been considerable charms and pressures
she had won the permission of the
Opera House people to stage what she
called “Pop at the Op” at four o’clock
on a threatening grey afternoon, to get
across the idea that the Opera House
was an institution where ordinary folk
like rock groups, teenage shouters and
even strippers could ply their trade in
the blank spaces between opera seasons.
Some musicians were setting them-
selves up on a platform on the terrace.
They all wore black, but two had
astrakhan caps and one had dark glasses.
These, explained a bearded gentleman,
were Little Sammy and the Sole Syndi-
cate. Or perhaps it was Soul, or even
Saul. The young people with shoulder-
length hair and white helmets were the
Easybeats, who had arrived by launch
and would play a new composition called
“Rocking at the House of Op”.
The guests, at this stage mainly
journalists, formed little huddles to
wonder what it was all about. Obviously
it was a publicity stunt, since you
couldn’t make any money out of it even
if you sold the champagne and the hot
dogs. A rumor went around that the
party was mainly revenge, to get even
with a women’s magazine to whom Miss
Robertson had sold the idea of a similar
party for Joan Sutherland and then had
been dropped from the guest list.
Miss Robertson, a tall, lanky girl with
pillowfuls of brunette hair, said that bit
was fairly true. They hadn’t even asked
her. But it wasn’t true that she was
doing it to raise money for a jaunt
to Vietnam. She was already fixed to go
for the Melbourne “Herald”. “Here,”
she cried above the din of the Soul (?)
Syndicate. “I’ll write it down.” She
scribbled Bien Hoa, Christmas, First
Battalion, and ran off, hostesslike.
Some of the men were wearing work-
men’s yellow helmets. “It's not really an
Opera House party unless you wear one
of these,” said the bearded gentleman,
presumably a veteran of the rather morej
tony affair to which Miss Robertson;
hadn’t been invited last month. Bright-
eyed, he pointed out three strippers, 1
distantly visible in gold lame pants and
ostrich plumes, as a baby Renault,
packed with Mr Douglas Lamb’s best
champagne, backed and filled within
inches of his toes.
The knock-off whistle blew and thej
workmen scampered to the scaffolding
to perch for a better view as the strippers
posed on the terrace for photographs.
Suddenly rain began to fall and the
guests, clutching their bottles of cham-
pagne and dabbing tomato sauce from
lapels, moved under shelter. Somewhere
around this stage Mrs Beth Churchill, a
Sydney socialite, was seen mounting the
platform, but whatever she said was
lost in the hubbub. Even Miss Robertson
had disappeared. Little Pattie was now
making the scene, clambering over the
parapet from the seaward side, but no
one paid much attention.
If it were true that the party was for
her friends, as the hostess said earlier,
they were clearly a forgiving lot. Who
exactly they were, though, was never|
clear, for excluding the Press, radio and
television people, who are critical enough
without putting them out in thunder-
storms, there remained only quasi-
celebrities like Tanya Halesworth and
cookery expert Graham Kerr.
Neighbors under a dripping umbrella
with a red-shirted workman, we asked
how he'd enjoyed the party. It was fine.
He hadn’t been here for the Joan Suther-
land party so couldn’t compare them,
but he’d just come from Yugoslavia,
after going all round the world, and
he’d never seen anything like it.
And whether he meant the edifice or
the party, no one will ever know.
“Imagine saying it was in bad taste,”i
Miss Robertson said next morningj
bewildered by a prissy newspaper storyj
and the disappearance of £l5O worth oj
liquor. “As I said at the time, it wasn’j
so much a party as a big, mad,
gesture . . .”
Whatever it was, it was certainly big
and mad, and something Sydney is noj
likely to see again.


Half-hour with
Hancock
It probably wasn't the right word to
apply to a man upward of 16 stone,
but languid was the word that sprang
to mind as we faced Mr Tony Hancock
over a tea tray at the Chevron.
Lugubrious? Lethargic? Listless? A
veritable lexicon of l’s offered themselves.
There, in silent resignation on a sun-
soaked daybed, sat Mr Hancock himself,
the blustering, breathless household word
of Hancock’s Half Hour, the pride of
East Cheam and the indefatigable battler
against British pomposity. His sad, blue
eyes looked out on a tumble of backyards
and excavations.
The interview got away to an unpromis-
ing start. Unlike most visiting entertain-
ers who display either enthusiasm or a
decent trepidation, Mr Hancock regis-
tered practically nothing. He did not, in
theatre parlance, give.
How did he propose to amuse the
patrons of the Silver Spade Room? He
supposed they were just the same as
any nightclub patrons anywhere else.
Had he heard anything, anything at all
about us, good or bad? He couldn’t tell
until he’d seen, could he? He’d play it
by ear. And he didn't like people trying
to put words into his mouth. How did
he know what amused people, or didn’t
amuse them?
His over-reaction was understandable.
The last few years have not been easy for
Tony Hancock. John Freeman did him
over on Face To Face, the no-holds-
barred television interview show. He quit
the profitable Hancock’s Half Hour on
television, got pneumonia and possibly a
nervous breakdown, lost money in a film
he’d collaborated on, got panned in a
new television show, and was sued for
divorce by his wife.
Hancock sat immobile while the tea
grew cold, his cigarette burning danger-
ously close to his fingers. We thrust a cup
of tea into his passive hands and
wondered which tooth to drill first.
His act, which he had checked for
sound and lighting in the Silver Spade
Room that morning with his old friend
Frank Ifield. the outgoing incumbent,
was a hotchpotch of “a few deliberately
ghastly impersonations and other things.”
He would be very active. In what way?
Well, he’d be moving around a lot, “so
people won’t see just my left shoulder-
blade.” Most of the act had been worked
out in variety halls, and presented in its
present form for the first time at the
“Talk of the Town” in London.
It was hard not to sound deliberately
soothing with a mention of Hancock’s
Half Hour, the high peak of his career
which he abandoned suddenly in 1961.
Everyone had loved Hancock’s Half
Hour, really and truly. With that and
Steptoe gone, a good British giggle was
hard to come by. “I know,” said Han-
cock. “I hardly watch it myself these
days, and I’m what you’d call a dead
average viewer. Once I used to watch
everything, but now there’s only sport
that’s worthwhile.” Of current television
humor he likes “Bootsie and Snudge”,
and sometimes Eric Sykes, with Brendan
Behan and Thurber his favorite literary
funnymen.
He had quit Hancock’s Half Hour
because he felt it was going to lose
interest. “There comes a point of exhaus-
tion,” he said. “If you do 60 good
episodes and then 15 bad ones it’s not
going to achieve anything.”
Hancock is a perfectionist by nature.
“That’s why I like cinema, because you
can work on a scene until you’re satis-
fied. There was never enough time in
Hancock’s Half Hour to get things ex-
actly right.” But here again we were on
dangerous ground, because the film that
was closest to his heart, “The Punch and
Judy Man”, had flopped. “I don’t know
why. We even got a good review in the
Times’, but it just didn’t take on. Yes,
it really was about a Punch and Judy
man. I tried hard to make it a comedy
about real people.” Had he unwittingly
trodden on someone’s toes? He didn’t
think so.
When his three weeks at the Silver
Spade are up, Hancock will fly to Amer-
ica with Mr Jones who is staying
here with him, to do a pilot film for
the William Morris Agency in Cali-
fornia. He is not too sure what it is
about, but thinks it might be interesting
to work in America.
But through the resignations and the
memories of old failures came the first
lovely glimpse of the comedian, as he
told of his beginnings in show business.
“I was living in Bournemouth, during
the war. A terribly respectable seaside
place full of retired colonels. We used
to go around to camps telling jokes.
At 17 I had the dirtiest act ever per-
petrated on the public and I didn’t
understand it until I was nearly 25.
“When I was 17 I rented a church
hall in Bournemouth and did the same
routine I used in the ack-ack camps.
People streamed out in rows until the
only people left were myself and the par-
son. ‘I knew your father and mother,’
he said, ‘and am eternally grateful that
they were not here tonight. It’s the most
foul thing I’ve ever seen.’ He said he
hoped he’d never see me again. But it
was a good thing it happened, I suppose.”
Finally, from inside the sad fat man,
the inner clown was beginning to strug-
gle free. It was like being present at the
birth of a butterfly, a little rumpled and
uncertain but still a butterfly. Suddenly,
as a fresh smile spread over his face, he
was a handsome man, the old funny
Hancock we knew and loved.
J.S.
THEATRE
Belief in Love
After the Fall. Arthur Miller. Independent
Theatre. Sydney.
Andorra. Max Frisch. New Theatre, Sydney.
Tt would not be wildly misleading to say
that “After the Fall” is about the
marriage of Arthur Miller and Marilyn
Monroe. But Miller objected strongly
when the New York critics treated it in
this way. Admittedly some of them went
on to say that it was in bad taste to write
such a play. But if writers followed
Emily Post’s rules of etiquette there
would be no literature at all. Miller ac-
cused the critics of concentrating on “a
detail of the story”. “The main theme of
my play,” he said, “is the story of a man
trying to find out why he is alive.”
As the play begins Quentin is seated at
the front of the stage talking about him-
self to an invisible Listener. As the result
of a shattering experience the suicide
of his divorced second wife, Maggie
he reached depths where he wondered
whether he had any reason to go on liv-
ing. Now he has met another woman,
Holga, who loves him, but he has to
grope his way back to a belief in the
possibility of love.
In a series of flashbacks he recalls his
past life and explains and comments
upon it to the Listener. The two themes
that obsess him are love and innocence,
for it is the undermining of his belief in
both that has caused him to despair.
He examines his relationships with his
parents, his friends and his wives. Look-
ing first at his childhood he casts a cold
eye on his mother’s love which he sees
as a mixture of selfishness and ambition.
Love and innocence are both brought
into question when he and his Left-wing
friends face the inquisition of the Un-
American Activities Committee. Lou, the
ex-Communist professor, commits suicide
when his friends desert him, but Lou
himself had betrayed their ideals when
he suppressed facts unfavorable to Rus-
sia.
Both Quentin’s wives accuse him of
insufficiently loving them and he comes
to doubt whether he is capable of love,
but at the same time he begins to doubt
the innocence and capacity for love of
everyone else.
The trouble with the play is that, in-
stead of the themes emerging from the
action, we have too much of Quentin
explaining and commenting and drawing
the moral. There is something school-
masterish about the proceeding: “My
Life and its Lessons, illustrated with
short dramatic sketches”.
Miller refers to Maggie as “a detail
of the story” but without her there would
scarcely be any story. She seems alive
while all the others are background
figures, mere sketches for characters.

Some, like Lou (well played by Reg Col-
lins), are at least life-like, but others,
like Louise, Quentin’s first wife, are un-
convincing.
But Maggie is there, uncannily so,
in a most intelligent performance by
Carmen Duncan. With her golden hair,
her vulnerable beauty and her breathy,
little-girl voice, she dominates the stage
and the story. If only Arthur Miller had
been able to present himself in the
character of Quentin with the same
mixture of sympathy and detachment,
then he might really have cast some light
upon his themes of love and innocence.
Leslie bright gives a skilful and ap-
parently effortless performance in the
exhausting part of Quentin, who is on
stage for the whole three hours of the
production. But Miller’s stage incarna-
tion does not offer the same opportuni-
ties to an actor as does John Osborne’s
Bill Maitland.
Peter Summerton’s production moves
smoothly in Michelle’s efficient set, a
many-levelled nightmare landscape.
Max Frisch sets his play about
anti-Semitism in an imaginary country
called Andorra. But the events are
easily recognisable as being typical of
the Nazi persecution of the Jews.
Andri is, supposedly, the Jewish foster-
son of an Andorran schoolteacher. As
a Jew he is regarded with dislike and
suspicion by most of the Andorrans.
When the dreaded Blacks from across
the frontier come looking for a scape-
goat to avenge the murder of a Black
woman, the Andorrans gladly hand over
the Jew. But all their talk about the
innate Jewishness of Andri becomes
nonsense when the school-teacher reveals
that the boy was not a Jew, but his own
illegitimate son.
Frisch’s demonstration of his thesis
is labored. The characters are the stock
figures of the literature of protest: the
idealistic schoolteacher, the brutal
soldier, the mean-spirited, grasping
petit-bourgeois and the pompous medical
officer whose racialism is the more
dangerous because more articulate. Add
to this a Judas-friend and an unfaithful
girl-friend (who turns out to be Andri's
half sister!) and the hero is well provided
with trouble.
Much of the early action of the play
is slow and awkwardly contrived. But
as it moves towards the climax there are
some strikingly theatrical scenes. Most
spectacular is the scene in the town
square in which the citizens, under the
watchful eyes of the black-clad foreign
soldiers, file across the square to the
“Jew detector”, their heads and faces
hidden beneath sinister black cloths.
The amateurish performance by the
New Theatre company underlines the
awkwardness of the play’s construction.
MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Dylan As
Documentary
Dylan. Sydney Michaels. St Martin’s
Theatre, Melbourne.
T praise this play, but with an uneasy
conscience. L is good, it moves and
compels, but it is symptomatic of a ten-
dency which I deplore. It takes two well-
known books on Dylan Thomas, drama-
tises them brilliantly but adds almost
nothing of its own: it does not deepen
our understanding, does not use the
means of the theatre to make something
which was not there before. It employs
the tools of the artist without creating
art; it follows the documentary trail as
American novelists do, but the material
it works with is beautiful in its dignity
and strength.
It does not have the originality of
“After the Fall”—it does not give us a
new Dylan as Miller gave us a new
Marilyn Monroe. I fear it will set a
trend . . . and I am not looking forward
to “Hemingway”. Or to “Judy”, a play
on Judy Garland in Australia. Too
topical, too easy! It slavishly follows
Brinnin’s “Dylan Thomas in America”
and less slavishly Caitlin Thomas’ “Left-
over Life to Kill”, both of which got hold
of the wrong end of the stick. Thomas
was not “killed by America” (he wasn’t
a Phar Lap or a Les Darcy), but by some-
thing much greater and more tragic.
But praise we must, because here is
Dylan Thomas the known Dylan
Thomas made visible again from the
shadows, and certainly in terms of
theatre. He has not been sentimentalised.
We feel that what destroys him is an
excess of love. He is the poet who drinks
his heart away, the boy whose gift is
too rich for him but who glows with
its loveliness and terror, the vessel that
cracks under the weight. On stage he
speaks his own marvellous lines, and if
there was a risk near the beginning that
he would break into verse as a musical
play bursts into a song at pre-arranged
moments, it was soon faced and over-
come.
Here is the war Dylan Thomas waged
to make money for his family and which
he lost because he liked freedom more.

He could not bear the loneliness his
talent demanded, and paid the price
Behan had to pay, and which he would
have had to pay without America, but
perhaps not without Caitlin. Raymond
Westwell sets him before us as force-
fully, I should think, as Alec Guinness
did in New York: lovable, pathetic,
suicidal and, in spite of himself, heroic.
John Brinnin, Dylan’s friend, Angus
Marius, his American publisher, and
Robert Mattock, his fellow poet and
boon companion, try to lead him through
the jungle of sophomores and alcohol.
These are all difficult roles, but Nor-
man Kaye, David Mitchell and Carl
Bleazby can handle them. Dawn Light-
foot plays Elena Antone, the old money-
bag in a clinging gown—also very good.
Penelope Shelton, among so many
females, has to be a woman, the one who
might save Dylan at the last. Her task,
artistically, is full of pitfalls, but she
avoids them. There is reserve and gentle-
ness in her acting.
Marcella Burgoyne is Caitlin. In life
Caitlin was Dylan’s unhappy rival,
hating herself for loving him and never
able to surrender her lesser self to his
destructive but greater one. In the play
she has the problem of letting out a
devil that must not throw as large a
shadow as his, of playing a leading role
without sharing the lead, which is nearly
impossible. Still, Miss Burgoyne manages
it, except in those sequences when she
has to be poet’s own girl. Why did
Sydney Michaels run away from the
death scene when Caitlin’s conflict could
have been shown at its starkest? He has
spared us and her too much.
George Fairfax’s production, with its
mobile effects, is ingenious and moves
swiftly. It stresses the sadly comic, and
rightly so, for this allows Raymond
Westwell to bring out Dylan Thomas’
desperate irony: a golden-tongued Welsh-
man who laughed himself to death.
DAVID MARTIN
MUSIC
Pianissimo
HPhe world is full of virtuoso pianists
today. At the Sydney Conserva-
torium, as at music schools everywhere,
the bulk of the students are either singers
or pianists. What is surprising is that,
from among a veritable crowd of famous
pianists, the ABC so frequently manages
to get the very best. Looking back over
the last four seasons, we had memorable
performances from outstanding players
such as Arrau, Barenboim, Brendel, Lili
Kraus, John Ogdon and Brenda Lucas,
Richter - Haaser and, most recently,
Serebryakov. Every pianist on the world
circuit can be expected to have a flawless
technique, an acceptable standard of
musicianship and an interesting reper-
toire; each one of the pianists I’ve
mentioned meets these requirements.
Dealing with someone new in this
context is far from easy, but every now
and then a visiting recitalist has some-
thing more than the above qualifications.
Thus, Barenboim shines in Schubert; Lili
Kraus has unique left-hand control and
specialises in Mozart; Ogdon has an un-
common manner and repertoire; Sere-
bryakov offered the elegant style of an-
other age and Russian rarities. To this
select company I now add Tamas
Vasary.
Vasary, on his first Sydney appear-
ance, impressed me very much; he im-
pressed me most by something quite
basic: pianissimo. It may seem foolish,
but it is a fact that a true, almost sound-
less, clearly audible pianissimo is rare.
Vasary opened with Beethoven’s Opus
26, the “Funeral March” sonata. This
is a rarely heard work. I don’t think any
overseas pianist has played it in Sydney
since the war. Literally, as well as
musically, this was Beethoven’s first 19th-
century sonata and Vasary’s interpreta-
tion was a wholly valid one.
The most interesting part of the recital
was Kodaly’s 1930 “Dances of Maross-
zek”, a work possibly never before heard
here. (Even on records, it only exists in
the much less interesting orchestral
version.) This music, ideally suited to
Vasary’s style of easy elegance, is among
Kodaly’s best. The “Dances” are based
on Hungarian folk-material and of con-
siderable pianistic merit. They were
given a simply stunning performance.
The rest of the programme consisted
of Chopin, Schumann and Liszt
romantic piano pieces that I am now
getting old enough not to sneer at.

The Dream of Alfred Deakin
By M. H. ELLIS
Alfred Deakin. A biography in two volumes.
J. A. La Nauze. Melbourne University
Press. £6 10s.
Tn writing these volumes Professor La
Nauze has enjoyed the advantage
of access to the best documenta-
tion of the life of any modern
Australian worth writing about: the
papers of a literate introvert who seems,
on the evidence now available, to have
spent a disproportionate amount of his
limited time in analysing himself and
setting down his actions past and present.
Professor La Nauze emphasises that
his aim has been to produce a political
biography with the major weight resting
on Deakin’s years of involvement with
the Federation movement and the foun-
dation of the Commonwealth Parliament
and Government.
However, the author adds little to
what has already been written about the
politics of Federation by more practised
hands and better analysts. It was the
extraordinary personal side of the sub-
ject that seems to me to have needed
more consecutive treatment and analysis
than it has been given. But to say this
is not to decry the overall merit of a
highly useful work.
One thing the book brings home
forcibly: Deakin’s almost complete per-
sonal isolation. Though his was a name
on every lip from 1890 to 1910, his con-
temporaries, in the main, had the illusion
that they were looking at him through
glass. He himself wrote after the dreadful
debacle which ended the Fusion Govern-
ment, his one disastrous attempt at party
leadership, and his political career in
1910: “I have never had friends (since
I was 17 or 18) to whom I could attempt
to impart my intimate thoughts in any-
thing like their fullness and entire frank-
ness . . . Growing older, my temptations
and opportunities for this kind of friend-
ship have steadily diminished. For many
years I have been spiritually and intel-
lectually alone.” And again, in 1911:
“I have always been a lonely politician
and man working with those whom the
fates gave me.”
And this seems to have been the key
to him. There was nothing original in his
thinking, little in his most renowned
actions that was not derived from read-
ing. He was. mentally, largely a sponge
which absorbed knowledge through the
written word, but he had no apparatus
for assimilating and balancing the diet.
He had. however, a perfect apparatus
for converting the food of the moment
into energy and into a magnetic expres-
sion of purpose. It would be interesting
to study the various permutations and
combinations of his life scientifically
against the background of what he was
reading contemporaneously with events.
Deakin was a voracious reader. He
read with avidity and delight anything
and everything. The peach Melba and
jam of literature went down the same
way, and each of them produced some
reaction: Mill. Adam Smith, Spencer,
Swedenborg. Darwin, Saint Theresa,
Wordsworth, the persuasive expositions
of spiritualist truth from America, all
were absorbed and some product exuded
from his mind and soul. As he wrote,
“measuring happiness by quantity, its
fullest source for me has come from
books . . More and more the height,
depth and breadth of the life I have led
in and thro’ letters expands as I recall
it until I wonder whether I have not lived
more and more intensely, through books
. . . most of the revelations of life, of
self to myself, or others, of the world, of
both worlds, of thought of religion and
of God (have come through this gate)”.
This, of course, does much to explain
the bewildering variety evident in
Deakin’s thinking and personality. It is
no wonder that he puzzles Professor La
Nauze. His whole life, inner and outer,
seems to have been constructed of im-
probability built on a foundation of the
improbable. His biographer remarks
plaintively: “Deakin’s is an embarrassing
case for the academic historian; a poli-
tician who was his superior in lecturing,
ALFRED DEAKIN
in breadth of reading and as a writer.
... Of all men concerned in Australian
politics, he is the last who should rest,
neatly labelled, in an historical pigeon-
hole.”
As if anybody who took one frightened
glance at such an assignment would try!
Professor La Nauze speaks in platitudes.
David Low once crammed the 20 sem-
blances of Billy Hughes into a single
caricature, but to cram the multifarious
Deakins into a pigeonhole would involve,
as Churchill would have put it, “some
pigeonhole, some cram”.
There was the young, bright-eyed,
coming-of-age Deakin who was preceptor
of a spiritualist Sunday school, for the
pupils of which, including his future
wife, he prepared a calendar of saints
constructed on such liberal lines as to
include George Eliot, the engaging mis-
tress of Mr Lewes, and George Sand,
the brazen mistress, in men’s pants,
successively of Alfred de Musset and
Chopin, the lady whose “Jacques”, with
its unsaintly lucubrations on the institu-
tion of marriage, will certainly not be
part of the bedside reading of the dis-
embodied spirit of St Paul.
There was the young medium Deakin,
who thought himself to be in communi-
cation with the “other side”, and who
actually believed in his contact with John
Bunyan, and wrote, himself, “A New
Pilgrim’s Progress” in which he pictured
the development in virtuous and revival-
ist achievement of a manifestation (not
unlike the young Alfred Deakin), who
eventually graduated to the title of
Redeemer and to tasks incidental to the
salvation of a community which had
more than a superficial physical resem-
blance to The Bulletin’s imaginative
depiction of the projected Federal
capital: “The city of sensual art with
nude statues at every corner . . . sculp-
tured in licentious postures, and wrought

upon the walls of temples and palaces
in loose gestures ... to delight the eyes
of a multitude among whom moral
turpitude was universal.”
There was Deakin the private hypno-
tist, who broke off his relationship with
a young man of feminine appearance,
recoiling in horror from the no doubt
over-interesting results he was produc-
ing. And there was Deakin the public
mesmerist, of the rhythmic oratory that
fell on the consciousness of crowds like
drum-beats in the silver tones of a
medieval church bell, luring them to
believe in postulates of which they did
not comprehend one word in 50.
There was also that other Deakin, as
he was when I first interviewed him
during his tour of Queensland early in
1909, who turned on his interlocutor not
the “burning gaze” that Professor La
Nauze credits Vance* Palmer with
attributing to him but a sudden, lifting,
limpid scrutiny of eyes that pleaded for
love and trust and co-operation; the eyes
that Frank Anstey (whom La Nauze, in
another context, unjustly calls “vitupera-
tive”) described as “come-to-Jesus eyes”.
The little bronze bust in Queen’s Hall at
Parliament House, Canberra, depicts the
Deakin of this phase to the life.
He was perfectly honest and single-
minded. Throughout his life he burned
to do right and, in sackcloth and ink,
privately bemoaned his sinful failures.
But the truth seems to be that he saw
no virtue in consistency and believed,
alas, that virtue never had its just reward.
He believed that policy in politics must
come before party, wherefore no com-
promise with the opponents of the pure-
souled liberalism he professed was im-
moral if it achieved some particular
stated end.
One of the most extraordinary things
about Deakin’s career lay in bis in-
voluntary ability to attract to himself the
whole credit for the deeds of others to
which he had merely given countenance
or support. In his own statement, he was
quite fair in saying that it was Berry
and Service, his tough old leaders, who
bearded and abashed the lion Salisbury
at the Intercolonial Conference of 1885,
and that he himself merely barked in
support of them. But he barked so elo-
quently that he, not his leaders, drew
the cheering crowds to the railway
station when the delegation came home.
It was a Royal Commission that
framed the Factories and Shops Act of
1886 that the Deakin-Gillies Govern-
ment adopted when it came into office,
but it was Deakin who was adorned with
laurels for thus producing the first legis-
lation in Australia. It was J. L. Dow, the
agricultural writer of the “Age”, an
expert in irrigation and the problems of
the Mallee, who went to California with
Deakin and became, on their return from
investigating, Minister for Lands. But it
was Deakin whom history crowned as
the man who made the desert bloom.
Wentworth in 1855 proclaimed the
Federation of the Colonies “one of the
most prominent legislative measures re-
quired. The Australian Natives’ Associa-
tion adopted the measure as an objective
in 1870; Parkes launched it on the sea
of practical politics. The Corowa Con-
ference hoisted the ingredients for action
on to the assembly line; Griffith drafted
the basic constitution bill. But though
Deakin’s contributions were merely
phrase-making—“ The Commonwealth of
Australia”, “One Nation, One Flag, One
Destiny”—and the arrangement of com-
promises and persuasion of touch-and-go
waverers, there are millions who prob-
ably have been taught to think of him as
the outstanding Founding Father of the
Commonwealth; indeed of the Common-
wealth itself as “Alfred’s Dream”, as
Victorians called it.
His health, of course, began to fail
him in 1907 after his strenuous work
at the London Imperial Defence Confer-
ence. His memory and his power to
retain what he dredged from books fail-
ed. His last years were lived in a sort
of half-perceived shadow world in which
only his immediate family seemed real.
His private yearnings to the last all
centred on his remorse for a life ill
spent in politics and for his failure to
do more to redeem the world. And of
mankind, despite its plaudits and almost
hero-worship of him, his mature opinion
was the poorest as he beheld it en masse
in Melbourne trams and trains: “Save for
a small minority a . . . gross, thought-
less, animal, careless and shiftless crew,
matching their environment, the evil-
smelling liquor shops, the gaudy drapery
shops, the silly and gross bookshops, with
Collins Street not a whit better —if any-
thing more openly dissipated and ex-
travagantly sensation-loving.”
Deakin died in October, 1919, with no
solace left save the comfort of his “dear-
est wife, unspeakably loyal” and his
three daughters. Mentally he had been
almost dead since 1917 when he had
lashed the mob with his invective and
abjured the world of men with the
anguished cry: “Let this rabble babble
end once and for all. Life has ended
—in truth, in fact and in judgment .. .
The Lady And The Robot
“You're just unfeeling,” she said, and was
not to know
How close to the knuckle she’d come, or
how
Unarguable her position was. He lay back
Breathing smoke rings as the slack
Hour after love disintegrated.
Her words like bees
Or electronic warnings did not freeze
Or warm any one of his nerves. What did
she say?
He had noticed this passivity, day by day,
Increasing. And he was losing his appetite.
Little he did mattered. There was no point
in choosing
Between one object, companion, or an-
other.
He did not know why he no longer
bothered.
“Your heart is clockwork.” She stood
accusative.
“No, plastic,” he thought idly, not wanting
to give
More hurt. And remembered reading about
that operation
Afterwards in some magazine. The ideal
patient
He’d been called: and later, the kidney
graft
Was even more successful. The surgeon’s
craft
Renewed one kneecap, and then a plate
in the head
Healed a wound from which anyone might
have died,
His artificial arm grew from the same
near-fatal accident.
Soon he came to understand what
machines meant
And for a while, drove himself, as the
saying goes,
To prove he was as good as the other
Joes.
This was a misdirection. Later, he knew
He was better than all the others and
threw
Himself bodily into the gradual replace-
ment
Of fallible parts and tissues. No deface-
ment
Of any public building had been so com-
plete.
Hair, liver, eyes, teeth, sex and fleshy
feet
Were, one by one, made incorruptible.
It was a new man now who sat to table.
“You'd better go home. Your husband will
be waiting.”
He said, mechanically, now that her
prating
Had reached a point where something must
be done
Not for his sake, but the neighbor’s. This
was the one
Note that would quieten her. Her eyes
grew mild.
“I wish,” she said, getting back on the
bed, “I wish we could have a child.”

The Search of Beatrice Cenci
By JAMES McAULEY
Beatrice Cenci. A play by Alberto Moravia,
translated by Angus Davidson. Seeker
and Warburg. 265. 6d.
rjiHE inevitable comparison between
■*- Moravia’s play, “Beatrice Cenci”,
and Shelley’s verse tragedy on the same
theme works mainly in Moravia’s favor.
Shelley kept closer to the facts of the
story, but that cannot be counted as an
artistic merit. Shelley’s strength should
have been in the poetry, but the poetry
and the whole handling of the play are
Shakespearian pastiche, not a genuine
creation. Moravia’s prototype is Racinian,
or even Greek, tragedy with clear,
biting prose doing duty for poetry. It is
his first venture upon drama.
Neither Shelley nor Moravia succeed
in making the monstrous father, Fran-
cesco Cenci, an intelligible character.
Both show him plunging deeper into
criminal perversity through boredom.
Strangely enough, while Shelley insists
loudly on his incestuous rape of his
daughter, Moravia touches on this only
in one scene, and neither asserts it clearly
as a fact, nor allows it to operate as a
determining factor in Beatrice’s later
conduct.
Moravia pitches Beatrice’s character
in a somewhat less exalted key than
Shelley does, but he succeeds in making
a powerfully alive person of her. There
is effective continuous irony in her rela-
tion with her accomplice, Olimpio. He
thinks he is in command of the situation:
he thinks Beatrice has become his mis-
tress through his planned manoeuvres,
and that after the murder she will con-
tinue to be his mistress on his terms. The
reality is quite otherwise. Beatrice has
yielded to him in order to make him an
accomplice. And after the murder she
rejects him, for her own reasons, even
though there is some emotional and
sensual reality in the bond between them.
Beatrice is in command throughout.
The complexity that Moravia seizes in
Beatrice is that, on the one hand, she
passionately wills her father’s murder
and degrades herself with Olimpio to
achieve it; and yet all the time she knows
that her deepest and most compelling
passion, which must ultimately prevail,
lies in the opposite direction: what she
really thirsts for is the recovery of
innocence. This is why she accepts the
outcome with equanimity: instead of
being able to go into a convent as she has
planned, she is arrested and will pay the
legal penalty. Earthly justice has inter-
vened to restore “some kind of order”
-—and perhaps the different order of
heavenly justice will also be satisfied.
With a play' rooted in a famous his-
torical “case'’, one can’t be sure what
difference it makes to our attitude to
know that the main events are true.
Would the play stand up so well in our
Founder
I awoke as rushes hissed,
brushing my dream. The stem
fouled the roots of a figtree.
A day, a night and a day
went by. Nobody came.
We waited; my runt twin wept.
Then there were fangs at my nape.
I was trailed through fallen figs,
meadow-marsh, and up to stone
that moonlit, I crawled upon
till she brought him and her dugs:
all the strength I had to sap.
He, had to be kept alive
long enough to be of use;
when our foster-mother died
I let the woodpecker feed
him, and the shepherds, sometimes.
He worked; cleared an olive-grove,
hewed great stones and trimmed them;
laid them as I commanded.
He leaped my wall but Rornide,
noli, noli, Romule,
he moaned before I murdered
him. I looked over Latium,
alone, and saw above my hills
an eagle rising like a sun
to burn upon Liguria,
Picenum and Calabria,
turn, and glide superbly down
to strut along my city walls.

view if it were pure fiction? I think that
part of its strength would seem to be
lost, but not by any means all.
I’m not sure how Moravia’s play
would meet the practical tests of theatre
performance. Some of the speeches seem
a little long and formal. But the action
has been admirably simplified and com-
pressed.
Italian literature is not in a very happy
state, and the narrow, chillingly destruc-
tive talent Moravia displays in his novels
is as responsible as any one man’s in-
fluence can be. This play seems to me
to have a greater breadth, and a less
stifling atmosphere, in spite of its
horrors, than Moravia’s previous work
would lead one to expect.
After the Fall
By VIVIAN SMITH
Edwin Muir. Selected Poems, edited by T. S.
Eliot. Faber. Bs. 6d.
The Quarry. Richard Eberhart. Chatto and
Windus. 365.
Ezra Pound and Sextus Propertius. J. P.
Sullivan. Faber. 58s.
Throughout his life Edwin Muir was
overshadowed by his greatest con-
temporaries: Yeats and Eliot. There is
no doubt that he is a more limited poet
than either of these though he cer-
tainly remains one of the most consider-
able English poets of the century.
Writers can probably be simplified
into two groups the technicians and
the visionaries: those whose revelations
come through a concentration on formal
procedures and those who are possessed
by a special vision of reality and who
under the sway of this vision can give
voice to poems of great intensity and
power. In the finest poets the technician
and the visionary are inseparable. As
Eliot says in his tentatively worded and
cautious introduction to this selection,
Muir was a poet of vision . . . “experi-
ment with forms of verse and with
varieties of expression . . . and tech-
nique . . . were hardly of primary con-
cern”.
Muir’s vision was basically that of
what he has himself called “The Story
and The Fable”. We live in time; we
remember the myth; or, in other words,
we live the Fall, we are haunted by
Eden and long to recover it. This is
the theme that runs through his work
and explains his particular obsession with
Time.
The formative experiences of Muir’s
life were his childhood in the Orkneys,
his early years in the Glasgow slums
and his long experience of Europe
throughout the whole of his adult life.
He has written about these experiences
in his fine autobiography, and they are
reflected directly and indirectly through-
out his poems from the early ballads to
“Autumn in Prague” and “Scotland’s
Winter”; they provide the landscapes and
backgrounds for many of his poems with
classical titles. They help to account for
bis references to Kafka and the note
of dread that occurs in many of the
poems of his middle phase. His experi-
ences in Prague after the war explain,
too, the apocalyptic note that runs
through his great last poems, notably
“The Horses”, “The Desolations”, “The
Good Town” and others. Eliot has
included all these poems in his selection
as well as the superb lyrics “The late
Swallow” and “The late Wasp” from
“One Foot in Eden”:
“And it is strange
How the familiar avenues of the air
Crumble now, crumble; the good air
will not hold,
All cracked and perished with the cold;
And down you dive through nothing
and through despair.”
Charles Tomlinson was probably right
in saying a few years ago that Muir’s
poetry finally lacks linguistic vitality; but
he is nevertheless a poet we cannot afford
to neglect.
Some poets write too little; others too
much. Richard Eberhart has always been
a hit-or-miss performer and his facility
is prodigious. His is a poetry of essen-
tially decent feeling and decent responses
forthright and masculine at its best;
loud-mouthed and blundering at its
worst. A number of the best pieces
gathered here are occasional poems
good-wish verses to Auden on his
fiftieth birthday, greetings to William
Carlos Williams. A group of poems on
local New England identities is appealing
as are the nature poems “The Seal”,
“Eagles” and “Rainscapes, Hydrangeas,
Roses and Singing Birds”.
Subtitled “A study in creative transla-
tion”, Mr Sullivan’s book is an intricate
and closely argued account of Pound’s
“Homage to Sextus Propertius” which
he sees as the only twentieth-century
translation that could be compared with
Johnson’s “Vanity of Human Wishes”
and Fitzgerald’s “Rubaiyat”. Mr Sullivan
gives a detailed survey of the history
of the poem, the reactions of various
critics to it, a comparison with Sextus
Propertius’ original and a leisurely
examination of Pound's changes, addi-
tions, omissions and abbreviations. Mr
Sullivan sees Pound as an innovator; the
“Homage” as a less complex poem than
“Mauberley”. He is fully aware that
“The Vanity of Human Wishes” is a
great poem in its own right; while the
“Homage” is not an entirely self-subsis-
tent work. This is a timely, specialised
piece of scholarship.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Big Guns in Fertilisers
fyiHE move by Esso into the fertiliser field was not a sudden whim prompted by the
A emergence of a rival American company, W. R. Grace, which currently is bidding
for the Australian company, Cresco Fertilizers Limited.
Esso has been considering this pros-
pect for many months and, in fact, had
tentative discussions w'ith Cresco four
months ago. Other moves have been
speeded up by W. R. Grace’s takeover
offer, too, for two UK-backed com-
panies, ICIANZ Ltd and CRA Ltd, have
now announced joint plans for a new
£l2m. fertiliser plant at Newcastle.
Boral-Mitsui are pressing ahead with
a fertiliser plant in Sydney to manu-
facture ammonia, principal ingredient
for nitrogenous fertiliser. W. R. Grace
was looking for outlets outside NSW
when it bid for Cresco, which has plants
in South Australia and Geelong, Vic-
toria.
Esso’s finance director, Mr W. C.
Jennings, indicated to The Bulletin
last week that Esso firmly intended going
into the nitrogenous fertiliser business
in Australia regardless of whether W. R.
Grace was successful with a bid for
Cresco.
In other words, loss of Cresco as an
outlet for fertiliser distribution would
not deter Esso from pushing ahead with
its plans. The company sees a big future
for nitrogenous fertiliser in Australia
and it has been supported in its opinion
by the happy discovery of natural gas
in an offshore field discovered by Esso-
BHP.
Another happy coincidence is that the
natural gas discovery is not far from the
Altona Petrochemical Co., in which Esso
has a 50 p.c. interest and operating
responsibility.
Fund raising evidently presents no
problem to Esso, because the £2.2 mil-
lion required for its initial 60 p.c. offer
for Cresco shares would only be the
beginning of a very large outlay required
to establish a nitrogenous fertiliser plant
and other outlets.
Evidently Esso is confident there will
be no restriction on funds from the US.
These funds could come from the parent
company either by way of loans, inter-
company accounts or the issue of more
stock.
At this stage it is impossible for Esso
to estimate what funds are required for
the project as there are many “ifs” about
the scheme at the moment. There is no
doubt that the investment will be very
large.
Many details have to be worked out,
but it is obvious it would be an advan-
tage to operate through an Australian
fertiliser company because of its existing
contacts with Australian fertiliser con-
sumers. By contrast, it would be a slow
and costly process to start from scratch
in setting up what would be a very com-
plicated distributing organisation.
Esso indicates that it will retain listing
of Cresco shares on the Stock Exchange,
as it welcomes participation of local
equity capital.
The exact location and size of the
plant have not been finalised, but the
potential demand for nitrogenous fer-
tiliser in future years justifies big think-
ing.
One thing is certain. Esso is definitely
intending to be a big force in the fer-
tiliser business in this country, either
through Cresco or by some other
method.
MLC Cuts Its Loss
HpHE decision by the MLC to cut its
loss in H. G. Palmer should be a
welcome relief for shareholders and
policy-holders.
There was too much speculation going
on in the shares and the various rumors

which were floating around were doing
no one any good.
The reputation of Mr Jackson as re*
ceiver also should be encouraging for
those who are interested in the survival
of H. G. Palmer, which will carry on
its normal operations under his super-
vision. it is upsetting for debenture
holders, the latest of whom may feel
they were assisting in an attempted
rescue operation.
The MLC experience has raised ques-
tions in Parliament, yet the matter should
not be exaggerated out of proportion.
The experience is a warning to other
insurance companies, which traditionally
use actuarial tables to calculate their
risks.
British and American Share Markets
New York share markets move
on their merry way, almost effort-
lessly recording peak after peak, London
has begun to draw attention to itself by
a more prosaic, yet no less effective
overall advance. The present index
position looked highly unlikely as recently
as the mid-year, when sterling seemed
under dangerously close threat of de-
valuation. Without doubt, too, London's
advance still appears more fragile than
Wall Street's; it is vulnerable to harsher
news from Rhodesia and must this week
face the release both of October's over-
seas trade statistics and the state of the
reserves.
On each of these counts, last week's
mood was optimistic: the Board of Trade
gave a happier picture of the nine months'
trade to September and gold reserves are
climbing as sterling holds strength.
Behind all the immediate improvement,
however, lurks the necessity to repay the
vast borrowings which sustained the
pound in the dark days.
Thus the Government's control measures,
the credit restrictions and even the con-
troversial imports surcharge are to con-
finue for some time yet. The need for
rigorous discipline was again confirmed
last week by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Mr James Callaghan, joined
once more by the Governor of the Bank
of* England, Lord Cromer.
The markets, though, rode all this out,
meeting also the situation that any reduc-
tion of bank rate has been postponed.
Equities, especially industrials, were
helped by some excellent company re-
ports. Trading volumes went up with
the livelier business, but signs of a
relative scrip shortage remain.
Wall Street certainly can make no com-
plaints about either volumes or prices.
Its heady process goes on against a back-
ground of rising company profits accom-
panied by great investor attention to the
blue chips. Motors, electronics and
aviation issues take some of the shine as
well.
The more cautious observers repeat
their warnings on the possibility of tech-
nical correction. Perhaps some hint of
that is conveyed by a heightening of Wall
Street's very characteristic, sudden adjust-
ments and a spate of stock-switching.

of the rural community obscures the issue of whether overall credit availability
will be sufficient for the economy’s requirements later this year. Bankers questioned
on the subject during the week told “The Bulletin” that releases of special deposits
would have to be from £60 to £70 million to provide the banks with the necessary
liquidity to meet the situation.
Six months ago this column, in a
broad stab at the question, submitted
that at that time (April) there was no
reason to suggest that the two main
sources of rural credits (the trading
banks and the pastoral companies) were
pinching the farmers or that capital-wise
the latter were uncomfortable. Since then
the position has changed somewhat, not
so much because there has been any
marked drop in rural incomes but be-
cause the drought has begun to hit cash
incomes in some areas pretty hard. The
prospect of the drought wearing on has
caused many farmers to pull in their
horns, particularly on the farm invest-
ment side.
This change has apparently not had
as marked effect on the demand for
credit as might be supposed. For one
thing, as Mr B. B. Callaghan, managing
director of the Commonwealth Banking
Corporation, told us some months ago,
the biggest strain on credit would come
when it was time for re-stocking. That
time is certainly not yet. In the interim
many farmers have succeeded in getting
indirect credit in the form of deferment
of contractual payments to banks,
pastoral companies, hire-purchase firms
and so on. (The managing director of
General Credits, Mr D. G. McComish,
told me this week that this company,
anxious to look after drought-stricken
clients, has been making the rounds of
them in some of the worst affected areas
of NSW, such as the Moree district.)
As for pulling in their horns on the
investment side, this is probably having
the effect of easing rural demands for
credit at the present juncture in that
farmers are no longer taking so many
plunges (and putting deposits) on new
farm machinery as they were earlier in
the year. Plenty of evidence is to hand
to show that farm investment is trending
lower. Last week the two biggest farm
machinery companies made drastic staff
retrenchments while at the same time
speaking of booming sales up to only a
few months ago. One of these, Massey-
Ferguson, has put off 165 men and the
other, International Harvester, 120. Both
attributed their slowing of production
to the effect of the drought on sales.
The effect of fluctuations in farm in-
vestment on the net credit requirements
of the rural sector has never, it seems,
been thoroughly examined, at least on
a national scale. This is something which
the Australian Bankers’ Association
might usefully turn their attention to
now that they have responded so well
to the call made in this column six
months ago for more research into this
whole question of rural credit. Their
little booklet, “Banks and Rural
Finance”, issued last week, is most useful,
even if there have been complaints that,
though it goes a good deal farther than
merely looking into the role of the banks
in this matter, it doesn’t go as far as
it possibly might into the part played,
say, by the fringe finance companies in
which the banks have such a big and
profitable stake these days.
One hears that the hire-purchase com-
panies are not at all happy with some of
the facets of motor business these days
(though they are still turning over
massive wads of motor paper) and are
even taking on an increasing amount of
personal loan business (one has recently
financed a purchase of a musical instru-
ment to the tune of £7OO for a Canberra
client). So it wouldn’t be at all surpris-
ing to see them get even further than
they have done thus far into rural hire
purchase, provided, perhaps, that they
don’t get their fingers too scorched by
the drought. Maybe the Reserve Bank
could instigate a survey of their commit-
ments in the rural credit field to supple-
ment the Australian Bankers’ Associa-
tion’s nicely documented information on
the other aspects.
The information supplied in the book-
let brings us up to June this year as to
sources of rural credit (the various
sources and shades of rural credit and
capital provision were outlined in a
Bulletin article on April 10 this year).
Certainly up to then there were no
grounds for complaint that the banks
might not be looking after the farmers
as well as they should, or at least to the
best of their limited liquidity. We find,
for instance, that at the end of June the
major trading banks were providing
about 45 p.c. of rural credit compared
with 20 p.c. by the pastoral finance com-
panies (which, of course, used quite a
bit of money lent them by the trading
banks), 16 p.c. came from State banks
and government agencies, 8 p.c. came
via war service and settlement funds, 6
p.c. from the Commonwealth Develop-
ment Bank and 5 p.c. from life offices.

control policies, the trading banks
managed tc increase their rural credit
outstandings by as much as £35 million
to £292 million in the year to June 30
(these were split as to 44.7 p.c. to sheep
grazing, 16.2 p.c. to dairying and pigs,
11.1 p.c to wheatgrowing and 28 p.c.
to other rural industries —none of the
above divisions are actually precise be-
cause of the mixed nature of the farms
of many boriowers). In addition to this
significant increase, the rise from £ll4
to £129 million in pastoral company ad-
vances contained a sizeable element of
new bank credit. Neglecting the latter
element, the major trading banks lifted
the proportion of rural lending to the
total new lending over the year from
18.8 to 19.7 p.c., which is slightly below
the proportion of 21.8 pc. which their
total rural advances bore to their total
advances for all purposes on July 14,
1965.
As with the trading banks last year,
demand tor credit from the pastoral
companies increased strongly. The book-
let says that this was due to the con-
tinuing restrictions on bank lending, the
fall in farm receipts (presumably in par-
ticular rural sectors, because overall
farm income was pretty well maintained
last year), and to the effects ot drought
(this couldn’t have had much effect up
tc June, 1 would have thought).
The rise of £l5 million in pastoral
company lending, says the booklet,
meant that the liquidity position of the
pastoral companies declined sharply and
their bank borrowing increased. It then
makes the important point that this
illustrates the basic problem for pastoral
finance companies operations in that,
although their lending is not inhibited
bv credit controls, the factors which
increase the demand tor rural credit also
affect the capacity of the companies to
meet this demand. While banks are pre-
cluded by lending restrictions from satis-
fying a wider area of demand for com-
parable rurai finance to that provided
by the pastoral houses, this unsatis-
factory position must continue to persist.
CROESUS
Bounce from Big Brother
Mr Holt talks to America
SPEAKING at the American Chamber of Commerce lunch in Melbourne last week,
on the morrow of the removal of the US lead and zinc import quotas, the
Federal Treasurer was probably right in skirting politely over the awkward matter
of the stiffening attitude of the Johnson Administration towards capital outflow.
Saying that, on his recent visit to
Washington, he had rather avoided talk-
ing about capital flows to those to whom
he had made special pleas on behalf of
Australia in April this year, Mr Holt
confirmed our impression (8., Oct 23)
that the latest US moves had taken him
by surprise. Also, despite his reassur-
ances that the US capital so far
arranged for minerals development here
was secure, he didn’t seem all that happy
about the future flow of capital for other
purposes.
As we pointed out last week, the latter
succeeded in bridging a greatly increased
deficit on our current balance-of-pay-
ments account with the United States
last year. (The deficit increased from
£2Ol million to £303.5 million, thus
accounting for a major part of our
overall current-account deficit of £385.4
million for the year.)
In his somewhat oblique musings on
the subject of capital inflow, Mr Holt
suggested that possibly US firms here
would have to resort increasingly to the
use of undistributed profits “to hold
their place and make progress” in their
Australian operations He was, presum-
ably, not taking into account that, under
new instructions from home, US firms
may well be asked to remit a bigger pro-
portion of their overseas earnings. In
the case of Australia these earnings
should have increased in the last year or
so. Up to this time we don’t know pre-
cisely by how much US earnings in Aus-
tralia have risen since 1963-64. But in
step with profits in the rest of the
economy the rise was probably sub-
stantial, providing scope for increased
remittances to the US as well as for local
reinvestment.
Admittedly, information coming from
the US on capital outflow possibilities is
rather confusing. For instance, we learn
from the Assistant Secretary of Com-
merce that in 1964 capital outflow was
$2400 million and with ten months if
the year gone he estimates a figure of
$3OOO million for 1965. From this it
may be inferred that when President
Johnson put a brake on the outflow early
in the year it was running at far above
the latter rate and has since been
chopped off sharply. Confirmation of this
is seen in the results of the voluntary
programme put into effect by 380 US
corporations approached by the Presi-
dent. According to an official survey,
these firms effected an overall cut-back
cf 53 p.c. in their net capital outflows by
the end of September. This suggests that
the further tightening announced could
be serious for us.
Surmising that Australia would be well
looked after. Mr Holt seemed to be
thinking aloud when canvassing how we
would fare in a fresh US analysis of
priorities for its overseas investment. He
gave some strong arguments to support
this view for instance, our close
military co-operation with the US, our
moral support of the latter’s efforts for
international peace and, perhaps more
tangibly, the $7OO million of armaments
orders we’ve placed in the United States
for delivery in the next few years.
There were other possibilities also,
such as redressing our adverse balance
of trade with the US. Suggesting it might
happen as part of the Kennedy Round,
the Treasurer was obviously thinking
that, if the US abolished its 25 cents
a lb. duty on woo! to supplement its
removal of the lead and zinc quotas, the
same object for our balance of payments
would be achieved as through the capital
pipeline.
It is a nice question whether we have
more to gain from keeping the US cosy
on capital investment than in pressing
for trade concessions in the US market.
Mr Holt, who deserves our gratitude for
his successes on the capital front
achieved by timely and persuasive inter-
ventions in Wall Street and Washington,
has achieved a good deal more than his
colleague, Trade Minister McEwen,
who is inclined to demand more as of
right than of favor things which are
decided not so much by the big men in
US Government as by trade lobbies in
Washington and the domestic position,
of the relevant American industries. The
removal of the lead and zinc quotas wasj
dictated not by McEwen’s stormy past
entreaties, but by the demand and supply;
position of the two metals in the US.

Commission during the GMH case in
the last week or two, it takes courage
deliberately to court American capitalist
enterprise in this country. Mr Holt has
been foremost in Cabinet in doing this.
Taking the broad view, he and the Gov-
ernment are right, because this is the
logical course if development is to
proceed here on the required scale.
The truth of the matter is probably
that, while expansion of exports to the
US would open up desirable oppor-
tunities for evening up the current-
account balance of payments and is
something we should strive to accom-
plish, in current circumstances of Aus-
tralian development it is not strictly an
alternative to maintaining high capital
imports from the US. This is not only,
as Mr Holt stressed at the lunch, be-
cause we anxiously need US capital for
not having got enough capital here to
fill the full bill, but also to help in
bridging the gap in the balance of trade
with the US which stems as much from
the avid appetite of Australian industry
and government for US equipment as
from anything else.
For this reason it was comforting to
hear from the Treasurer in advance of
publication of the precise figures that
private capital inflow from the US last
year was higher than in any of the three
previous years (the highest of these was
£96 million in 1963-64) and that it is
continuing unabated this year. On the
other hand, looking at the visible trade
figures, it is somewhat alarming to realise
just how much the overall balance of
payments has become dependent on it
(8., Oct. 23, page 15). The corollary
of this is that, as we have obviously
become one of the United States’ most
rapidly growing overseas markets, we
have more reason than we ever had to
expect that country to receive more Aus-
tralian exports.
Mr Holt sketched an intriguing picture
of the development of the US-Japan-
Australia trade triangle in the last 15
years. Perhaps if Mr McEwen had been
speaking in his place he would have
made the point that, on the US-Australia
side of the triangle, somehow our exports
to the US have only managed to in-
crease from £49.6 million (1949-50) to
£130.8 million last year (a rise of 184
p.c.), whereas between the same two
years US exports coming our way increas-
ed from £52.2 million to £335.1 million,
or by 542 p.c. From having 8.2 p.c. of
our imports market in 1949-50, the US
has about trebled its share to 24.3 p.c.,
while as a percentage of our total exports
that of those going to the US has
declined from 15.2 to 10.1 p.c.
These figures in themselves present an
open challenge to the Australian Govern-
ment to increase exports to the US. The
real question is how to go about it. At
one stage at the American Chamber of
Commerce luncheon it looked as if
Holt was going to fall into the same trap
as McEwen (he did this a couple of
years ago, talking hot on the American
meat industry lobby to the Stock Ex-
change of Melbourne when the Trade
Minister was abroad). Mr Holt was
probably right in complaining that the
US should have given Australia a bigger
import quota for sugar than the one of
162,000 tons a year recently negotiated
and, having made the protest, to meet
the possibilities for achieving the
abolition of the wool duty via Geneva, a
much more hopeful route, perhaps, than
open political confrontation of the
McEwen brand, which hasn’t got us
anywhere with “big brother” so far.


Prospecting for Phosphate
Grist for the fertiliser boom
By MICHAEL TERRY
THE hottest thing in prospecting for minerals used to be uranium. Then it was
iron ore. Now it is phosphate. For the last half-year I have been hot on its trail.
It is the most challenging assignment
in 40 years of this kind of work. The
matter is urgent because Ocean and
Nauru Islands’ deposits, which supply
most of Australia’s needs, are estimated
to cut out in 20 years. By then their
throughput of calcium phosphate will be
too low a grade to pay.
Already, besides the tonnage available
from the British Phosphate Commission,
we are importing from the dollar market.
Demand, even if temporarily reduced by
the drought, will nevertheless continue to
escalate. From all sources approximately
2.6 million tons of rock phosphate are
imported annually. About 25 p.c. of
this conies from Florida. The general
landed cost is £7 10s. a ton. The BPC
cost is lower, since it sells at cost plus
freight. A find within Australia will
greatly lower the drain on overseas
funds.
It follows that, in all States, the Mines
Departments, the Geological Survey, the
universities and the CSIRO are all eager
to help. The Bureau of Mineral Re-
sources is also importing two top-rank
US phosphate specialists to guide Aus-
tralian searchers.
There is not the slightest use in going
bush with a Landrover and a geological
hammer without a prior and thorough
knowledge of the background to this
tantalising subject. And it takes a lot
of time to make the essential appraise-
ment in all States.
No rule of thumb exists on how to
find phosphate. With gold, the prospector
in course of time learns to distinguish
between “kindly” and “hungry” country.
It is an extra sense which the geologist
seldom, if ever, acquires. His academic
approach can be compared with some-
one surrounded by books of reference
and geological maps, and another who is
slightly “fey” and accepts no rules. It is
an old saying that “the geologist has
never found a mine”. The Western
Mining Corporation found this out when,
in the ’thirties, it set out to revolutionise
prospecting on the West Australian
goldfields.
Nature abhors a straight line—the big
mines of the world are mainly geological
freaks. That is why, originally, Tennant
Creek was turned down by Bewick More-
ing as a secondary enrichment around
the core of an ancient mineral spring.
Later, prospectors proved a curious
lenticular formation in haematite which
led to a major gold, and subsequently
copper, formation of national import-
ance.
If all this seems rather off beam, it is
to illustrate my conviction that phosphate
will be found in Australia more by guess
than by God.
Several big companies have taken up
huge prospecting reserves, particularly in
Western Australia. They are spending a
packet in an academic approach to the
problem. Apparently their methods are
based on local interpretation of the con-
ditions under which phosphate has been
deposited overseas. My own idea, how-
ever, is that payable Australian phos-
phate will be found in some novel
geological situation. The great age of the
Australian continent suggests this.
There is no known concentration of
bird life, except on one or two small
islands off the West Australian coast,
where sufficient guano may have been
deposited on limestone for calcium phos-
phate, by interaction, to have resulted,
as on Ocean Island. Ocean and Nauru
are mere specks in a mighty ocean. The
immensity of our coastline does not
impel birds to congregate. Almost all
States have cave deposits of bat guano.
If some are useful for a syndicate to
handle for local sale, they are not the
meat of a company thinking in terms of
tonnage and long life.
Basic factors delimit the profitable
search areas The rock, being low value,
should be no more than 50 miles from
the coast. We import it with 35 p.c.
phosphoric oxide from Florida, at a
rating known as 77 BPL (bone, phos-
phate, lime), which is rather more than
twice the phosphoric oxide figure. The
Nauru and Ocean imports rate at 82
BPL, equivalent to tricalcium phosphate,
which does not exist in nature. This trade
rating is a curiosity. The proximity of a
source of sulphuric acid is vital. Natural
phosphate is made sufficiently water-
soluble, and thus can be absorbed by
the soil, after it has been treated with the
acid. Overburden is important. There
should be no more than about 20 feet
of soil to be bulldozed away for huge
scoops to get to work on the deposit.
A find would have to be unusually rich
to be profitable 100 miles from the coast.
The cost of building a railway, perhaps
to the coast, together with the erection
of a crushing plant at the mining site
and means of “beneficiating” the crude,
would be limiting factors.
The known Australian deposits, es-
pecially near Mansfield (Victoria) and
in South Australia's Kapunda-Angaston
district, suffer from a common handicap.
They are too high in impurities. Once
the combined iron and aluminium oxides
content exceeds 6 p.c., treatment of
natural phosphate by sulphuric acid to
make “super” produces side effects
which gum up the process. The usual
acceptable combined upper limit is 4.5
p.c. This limits the availability of Aus-
tralian phosphate and is also a problem
common to deposits elsewhere.
Field search is tough for two reasons.
Without a travelling laboratory, where
proper quantitative tests can be made on
the spot, the prospector has as yet only
one unstable and one briefly stable
means of proving phosphate. The

ammonium molybdenate test solution
lasts perhaps ten days in hot weather;
the Vanado-Molybdeno solution lasts for
several weeks. In both cases about
enough powdered sample to cover a
shilling and placed in a watch glass with
reagent produces a yellow precipitate
varying in color according to phosphate
content. If they are carried in a plastic
“squirt bottle”, the phosphate in some
plastics can yellow-off the test solution,
making it unreliable. And a glass bottle
with a top that does not get loose in
rough bush travel is hard to come by.
The answer for prolonged bush search
must be tc carry ammonium molyb-
denate crystals in one bottle and 10 p.c.
nitric acid in another. Place a crystal of
the former on a suspect specimen, squirt
on a few drops of nitric, and whatever
yellow precipitation results should with-
out doubt derive from phosphate.
To reduce the number of chemical
tests there is still another prospector’s
dodge. I have tongue-tested many speci-
mens and found out that phosphatic rock
is slightly acid and definitely astringent
in the mouth. I may have to wait a few
minutes to get the true taste, but very
soon I know whether the percentage is
important or not.
To identify phosphatic rock visually
is just about impossible. It varies from
hard compact stone to loose friable
muck. The color can be deep yellow,
orange, blue, brown, white, near-black,
greenish or almost anything. It can be
in egg-like nodules (as in Victoria),
embedded in limestone, mudstone or
marble (as in South Australia), or in
beach sands (as in Western Australia).
To test thoroughly an area 10 miles by
10 miles might take six months, yet you
may walk 50 yards from a cliff exposure
and miss an important deposit.
Some searchers are analysing oil bore
cores for phosphatic horizons which, if
good, could justify prospecting far from
the drilling site. From this they plan
to deduce whether the phosphatic sedi-
ments could be sufficiently near the sur-
face to warrant shallow drilling. It
seems a long shot, as faulting may have
moved the beds far from the theoretical
site.
An original approach is indicated. Off-
shore dredging is warranted. The phos-
phatic nodules of Victoria, too widely
dispersed to be worth serious considera-
tion, may be concentrated in the troughs
of Bass Strait. Pin-pointed areas which
have never needed “super” in farming
may overlay hidden natural sources.
Crystalline calcium phosphate (apatite),
in all igneous rocks, can be a lead.
Where it exceeds one p.c. and limestone
is adjacent to “fix” the shedding, a
deposit can result. At least three areas
in Queensland possess these conditions.
Australia’s phosphate may derive from
two principal sources—from the upwell-
ing of Antarctic waters rich in phos-
phate along our shores or from denuda-
tion of ancient rocks. Both suggest de-
position of phosphatic sediments, under
suitable conditions, beneath ancient seas.
Such beds, when elevated, eventually be-
come coastal or inland shales, limestones
or mudstones. They will hold the ton-
nage needed by a large company.
Animals, forced to the seaboard when
the inland changed from lush to arid,
may have broken down to some huge
concentration of phosphate-rich bones
overlaying limestone, hence calcium
phosphate. This is argued to have
occurred during the Ice Age in Florida.
A phosphate find in Australia is in the
melting pot. Perhaps some lonely pros-
pector, seemingly off-beam, will fluke on
the nationally important deposit which
the Commonwealth so urgently needs.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Wheat Subsidy Vindicated
One lesson from the drought
YT is difficult to find anything good coming out of a drought, but it could be said
that the current wheat situation has completely vindicated the old hands of the
industry.
For the last four years there has been
mounting criticism of the wheat stabilisa-
tion legislation. The criticism coincided
with increasing yields, culminating in
the all-time record 370 million bushels
in the 1964-65 season. The critics’ case
was that the wheat industry could get
along quite well without a subsidy and
that eventually we would have surpluses
which could not be sold.
The fact that, in each of the last four
seasons, the wheat was all sold only
spurred the critics on to greater efforts.
The sales were dependent on the pur-
chase of wheat by Red China and this
market could disappear any time and
without warning. The wheat industry
reply to this has always been based on
one main point—we must grow wheat
while we can, because we never know
when poor seasons will prevent us grow-
ing it. Many critics dismissed this argu-
ment as so much talk. They (the critics)
were too young to remember the
droughts of the past.
Now, with the first real drought since
the early 19405, the critics’ case appears
to have been demolished. According to
a NSW wheatgrower member of the
Australian Wheat Board, Mr J. P. Cass,
the 1964-65 crop will total around 230
million bushels, compared with the 370
million last season. NSW is expected
to harvest about 15 million—a crop so
poor that the State may have to import
wheat from Victoria. Queensland, like-
wise, is expected to harvest about 15
million bushels. Conditions are not so
bad in Victoria and South Australia,
where crops of 65 million and 43 mil-
lion bushels are expected. The only
really bumper crop will be in Western
Australia, where 85 to 90 million bushels
are likely.
There should be a “satisfactory clear-
ance” this coming season, according to
the Bureau of Agricultural Economics.
The Soviet Union is expected to buy
wheat from Canada, France and the
Argentine, and could well take Aus-
tralian wheat. China is expected to need
significant imports in the coming year.
Japan, India, Ceylon, Malaysia and
Singapore have indicated that they will
buy more wheat.
While there is no doubt that the
demand for wheat exists, there are a
couple of important conditions which
will influence the selling of Australia’s
drought-reduced crop. Production, world-
wide, in 1965 is expected to be higher
than the record 9154 million bushels in
1964. Canada, France and the United
States have harvested bigger crops than
in 1964.
The US has sold to Russia before
and will probably do so again—but not
to China. Canada sells to both Russia
and China. Canada, despite its proximity
to the US and its close financial and
business ties, has kept well clear of
involvement in Vietnam or any other
Asian trouble spot. It has been reported
that Chou En-lai has warned Australia
that the entry of Australian forces into
the Vietnam war will be considered by
China in placing wheat orders.
So far, and this could change any
day at all now, we do not know the
Chinese intentions concerning our
coming harvest. We do know, however,
that in the past China has bought wheat
from Australia for reasons strictly non-
political. They could get our wheat at
the right price, on attractive credit terms,

and on time. This last reason is most
important and could well overshadow
political considerations. Mere size in a
wheat crop is like size in an army—it
is not enough.
Canada, with a record crop and the
biggest-ever contract with the USSR, is
in grave trouble meeting delivery dates.
The wheat is available, Russia has the
money, but the Canadian railway system
and shipping difficulties are causing
grave concern.
One of the leading wheat legislation
critics in Australia, Mr E. J. Donath,
made an interesting observation during
a talk on the wheat industry he gave
recently at a public lecture at Mel-
bourne University. Australia, he said,
had a long history of antagonism to-
wards China in the United Nations, long
before the Vietnam conflict. Canada, on
the other hand, had noticeably avoided
entanglement with China. Yet Australia
had continued to sell wheat in large
quantities to China.
Mr Donath, who added that he was
not opposed to selling wheat to China so
much as being dependent too much on
one market, would still like to see the
subsidy cut out. He said he would be
“surprised if the harvest did not come
close to 300 million bushels”. No one
could ever accuse Mr Donath of being
inconsistent. Despite the present
drought, he suggested that by 1970 we
would be having 400 million bushel
average harvests and disposal would be-
come extremely difficult.
It may appear trite, yet the real
problem of the wheat industry in Aus-
tralia is spiralling costs of implements,
fuel, wages, fertiliser, storage construc-
tion, railway tricks, etc. If the costs
could be kept down there is no reason
why 400 million or even 800 million
bushel harvests could not be sold. The
world is hungry enough.
As for the subsidy which Mr Donath,
and others, object to, this again may be
trite but it is, in reality, only a part-
subsidy. Wheatgrowers do not get paid
for wheat they do not grow. The in-
dividual grower must decide whether he
takes the risk of growing a crop in a
marginal area. Many, in parts of NSW
and Queensland particularly, will be very
cautious from now on.
The subsidy applies only to the first
150 million bushels for export and, in
return, growers must supply the Aus-
tralian home market at the cost of pro-
duction figure. And, most important of
all, this cost of production figure can,
by negotiation between the Wheat Board
and the Government, be adjusted to dis-
courage indiscriminate planting of wheat
if such a situation ever does arrive.
With these checks and balances, there
seems little likelihood of any Govern-
ment taking the criticism of the wheat
legislation too seriously.

The Fate of Black Sheep
Breeding color out of merinos
At the very least one in a thousand
merinos is a black sheep. This
figure is derived from records of sales
of white and colored wool kept by the
Australian Wool Board for the last 20
years. Probably, however, black or pig-
mented lambs appear at a rate fully four
times this figure. Most woolgrowers take
steps to eradicate black or spotted sheep
by destroying them at birth or by putting
them in the station’s ration flock. As a
result, only a few survive to even their
first shearing. Moreover, black patches
are removed from fleeces, which are
then sold with wool from pure white
sheep. Studies of individual merino
flocks and studs showed that the fre-
quency of pigmented sheep ranged from
as low as two to as high as fifty per
thousand.
Black merinos evidently arise from a
recessive gene rather than as a result
of a recurrent gene mutation. Accord-
ingly, it should be possible to breed color
out of merinos. The 20 or so original
studs and their daughter studs could set
about doing this by instituting a pro-
gramme of progeny testing. The gene
was doubtless brought to this country
by Macarthur. He got some of his breed-
ing stock from King George Ill’s Spanish
merino flocks, which were well known
to contain pigmented animals. For in-
stance, it is recorded that in 1791 one
of these flocks dropped 66 lambs of
which three were black. And as early
as 1870, in Australia, John Ryrie
Graham was exhorting breeders not to
use any sheep that had any black on
them.
In Spain today flocks of black merinos
are kept and many of Spain’s white
flocks contain a relatively high pro-
portion of coloreds. Pliny the Younger,
the Roman letter-writer, while travelling
abroad about the time of the coming of
Christ wrote that he was impressed by
the high proportion of black sheep to
be seen in Spain. Long before Spanish
wool was sought for its quality it was
celebrated for its color. Black is one of
the most expensive of the pigments. How
could poor clergymen afford to clothe
tnemselves correctly if it weren’t for the
black sheep!
Now Queensland
Extensive areas in Queensland appear
to be cobalt deficient. Chemical
analyses of cereal forages grown in the
south-east and of sorghum grains from
the Central Highlands disclose that their
cobalt content is often extremely low.
The test samples came from a range of
different soils and this suggests that the
deficiency may be widespread through-
out these parts of the State. The finding
will be of particular concern to beef
producers who rely on winter cereal
forage crops or who provide sorghum
grain to top off their beasts. At least until
persuasive evidence to the contrary is
produced, they would be wise to give
their cattle a precautionary dose of
cobalt.
Dr H. R. Marston, Australia’s famous
animal nutritionist who died recently,
considered that sheep fodder should
contain not much less than one-tenth of
one part of cobalt per million parts of

feed. Cattle may be able to get by on
even slightly less cobalt in their diet.
However, the samples investigated
recently at the Animal Research In-
stitute. Yeerongpilly, Brisbane, rarely
had more than half the amount said by
Marston to be minimal for sheep. An
actual feeding trial has been carried out
in Queensland which proves the value
of artificially added cobalt; In this
experiment the cattle had a ration of
sorghum grain and sorghum silage. Their
rate of body weight gain was increased
significantly after “cobalt bullets” had
been shot down their throats. On the
limited evidence available to date, cattle
on pasture in Queensland appear to get
sufficient cobalt for normal growth.
New Rice
Australians like long-grain rice verv
much. The demand is such that
local growers have been unable to meet
it. This has been due in large part to
the lack of suitable varieties, especially
for our most important rice-growing
region the Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area. The New South Wales Depart-
ment of Agriculture now confidently
expects to be able to give this area a
new long-grain variety that farmers will
be keen to sow and people glad to eat.
A breeding programme started on the
Yanco Agricultural Research Station in
1959 has produced quick results. The
yield capacity of the station’s new long-
grain crossbreds matches that of the
short-grain varieties w'hich have always
given MIA growers gratifying harvests.
Quality testing has not yet been com-
pleted. However, the department ap-
parently feel sure that at least one of
the hybrids will meet minimum quality
standards because seed stocks are
presently being built up so that there
will be ample seed for release to
growers as soon as quality has been
proved. This will probably be within
two or three years.
The new crosses have been derived
from Bluebonnet 50, Calrose, and
Caloro 11. Bluebonnet 50 is a long-
grain rice but it has not suited the MIA
because of its late maturity and low yield.
Under some conditions, fairly common
in the area, it sets scarcely any seed. It
was introduced to the MIA about five
years ago as a stopgap in response to the
Rice Marketing Board urging growers
to try to capitalise on the expanding
market for long-grain rice. The other
two parent varieties are short-grain. In
contrast, they are well adapted to the
soils and climate of the MIA and so are
reliable and high-yielding. Selections of
the cross between Bluebonnet and Cal-
rose, in particular, are most promising.
Unfortunately, neither these nor the other
crosses have performed well in the
Murray Valley.

INVESTMENT
Not Two of a Kind
Fortunes of a banking pair
The National Bank and the Bank of
Adelaide have produced varying re-
sults for their shareholders to mull over.
The National suffered a minor setback,
with profit down from the record
£1,457,000 to £1,336,000. The basic
cause appears to have been the trading
bank, which earned £1,150,000 against
£1,227,000 previously. However, the
40 p.c. investment in Custom Credit
would also have had some impact, as its
1964-65 dividend was lowered to 10 p.c.
This was the second reduction in suc-
cession.
Had it not been for the substantial in-
crease which the group’s savings bank
managed to achieve, the consolidated re-
sult could have been much worse. The
savings bank lifted profit from £lBO,OOO
to £236,000. Without this increase, dir-
ectors may have been forced to consider
a cut in the 10 p.c. dividend, established
in 1963-64. As it is, the consolidated
figure is still equal to only 10.6 p.c. on
capital. If the downward trend con-
tinues in the current year, shareholders
may see a return to the lower dividends
paid prior to 1963-64.
The expanding Bank of Adelaide pro-
duced quite a different set of figures.
Profit rose from £306,000 to a peak
£338,000. Although the rate of growth
was less than in the previous year (when
profit rose £54,000), the fact that the
business is still developing at a fast rate
augurs well for shareholders. Both the
trading and savings bank showed in-
creases during the year.
This group also distributes a 10 p.c.
dividend, the basic difference from the
National being the fact that this has been
the rate for 12 successive years now.
Moreover, earning rate on higher aver-
age capital, up from 17.5 to 18.4 p.c.,
provides a substantially better cover for
the payout. Shares from the recent new
issue rank for a third of the final divi-
dend, so ranking capital will take a
bigger jump in the current year. Never-
theless, the group is in a far better posi-
tion to withstand any lowering of earn-
ing rates than the National.
Dull Lights
Electric Signs (not to be con-
fused with another Neon com-
pany which has been under receivership)
continued to slide downhill during the
latest year, announcing its third consecu-
tive decline in profit. The figure was
£33,000, equalling 15.7 p.c. on capital
and adequately covering the steady 12i
p.c. dividend. However, it compares
rather unfavorably with the previous re-
sult, which equalled a healthy 19.2 p.c.
on capital.
The profit is the lowest from the group
since 1957-58. It reflects rising costs in
the industry more than anything. An
additional factor has been trouble with
bad debts, primarily a result of dealing
with small businesses, often starting out
for the first time, which have been un-
able to make the grade. Fortunately
there are some signs of a halt in the
drift during the current year. Rental
incomes have been rising, but these are
usually more evident in the accounts of
the years following that in which the
increase originated.
Shareholders will be hoping that such

proves to be the case. They will hot
be particularly happy if directors are
forced to reduce the dividend, which
has been in force for 11 years now.
Over that period, they have also receiv-
ed a one-for-two bonus issue and a par
issue on the same basis. One of the
group’s limiting factors is that depreci-
ation charges usually rise with any in-
crease in rental income, as more signs
are made and put into use. In relation
to profits the depreciation bill is huge
£127,000 in the latest year.
Ampol Boring On
Anly a fractional profit increase was
” registered by Ampol Petroleum Ltd
in the year to September 30, although
revenue increased by 8 p.c. and sales in
gallons by 10 p.c.
Tax provision, subject to revision, is
£1,358,000 (1964, £1,303,208) and
depreciation £1,712,649 (£1,681,102), to
leave a net profit of £2,900,000
(£2,890,000).
The search for oil on Barrow Island
is at a particularly interesting stage
(each of 11 wells has produced oil and/
or gas in one of three horizons). A new
fracturing process used in the last two
wells has stimulated drilling. The extent
of the horizon and its potential may be
assessed by the end of the first quarter
of next year.
The finding of commercial oil on the
island by Wapet would be a handy break
for Ampol, which owns 67.6 p.c. of
Ampol Exploration Ltd which in turn
has a one-seventh interest in Wapet.
Ampol’s Lytton refinery programme,
involving fixed-interest borrowings of
£13.3 million and a £7.8 million issue of
deferred shares ranking for dividend in
1967-68, demands very fine planning on
the part of management.
The excess of costs over revenue in
the refinery’s running-in period has been
capitalised rather than charged against
profits.
Earning rate of 16.8 p.c., a shade
higher than in 1964, again clears the 14
p.c. dividend paid for the sixth succes-
sive period.

imported. The well - developed and
diversified local industry could supply
85 p.c. of Australian requirements if
tariff anomalies were removed.
These anomalies have arisen from
changes in types and styles, particularly
in the greater use of synthetics and the
trend to tufted carpets. The 20 p.c.
British preferential duty was established
when most imports were Axminster and
Wilton-type carpets, with an all-wool
pile.
The company is exploring markets in
Canada, East Africa and the Middle
East. To be really competitive with
Britain and Belgium, Mr Rowe said the
Australian industry needs lower unit
costs, possible with greater production
and a larger share of the home market.
No Shell Out
TVking a line from the chairman’s
A statement, investors should discard
any hopes they may hold of being offer-
ed a share interest in the local opera-
tions of the Shell group. Although the
reorganisation of its capital structure
makes such a move more feasible, it
seems to have been inspired mainly by
a desire to put all the local activities
“under one roof”.
There may be other motives but, in
the absence of any concrete reasons for
the move from the directors, this is the
main conclusion to be drawn. The fact
that local participation has been made
more accessible is probably a mere by-
product which was hardly considered by
the board except, perhaps, for the long,
long term.
Shares in the Australian companies,
previously owned by Shell London, have
been transferred to Shell Australian
Securities Ltd, whose capital is wholly-
owned by Shell London. Thus, a central
or holding company has been formed
for the Australian subsidiaries for the
first time. The chief advantage for local
investors (and especially finance writers)
will be the access provided to the per-
formance of the group in Australia as a
whole. This has been unavailable to
date without a great deal of searching,
assumption, and not necessarily correct
aggregations of the figures from the
various operating companies.

Cautious Healing
of A. G. Healing Ltd, electrical appliance and
engineering group, continue to be cautious about the
company’s position.
They have intimated that profit for the year to June last
should be about level with the £537,927 earned in 1963-64
(17 p.c. on capital, of which 12 p.c. was distributed).
But to date there is no dividend announcement. Share-
holders were by-passed in June, in the interests of liquidity,
although directors said that, on indications then, shareholders
should receive a steady 12 p.c. in one final payment for the
year.
Automotive parts have continued to sell at a high level in
the current year; domestic appliances were selling “at a satis-
factory level”.
In December last, Healing arranged to sell its subsidiary
R. and G. Finances Pty to the Mutual Acceptance Co. Ltd for
£2.Bm. cash, payable over two years. Healing thus relieved
itself of any bad debts problems and ameliorated its liquidity
position.
Healing is now endeavoring to attract holders of the 7± p.c.
notes in the subsidiary A. E. Goodwin Ltd, which mature next
month, to convert to 8 p.c. debentures in Healing itself.
Losing a Million
Tn the five years to June 30, 1965, Sydney financier Pacific
Acceptance Corporation Ltd (official manager appointed)
has lost over £lm. The loss for the latest year was £107,440,
of which £3 1,992 was write-offs or extra provisions, the balance
a trading loss.
No new advances or loans have been made in the past two
years.
The accumulated loss would now be in the vicinity of
£760,000 as against subscribed capital of £1,286,667 and share
premium reserve £93,333.
The company suffered from a lack of working capital.
Activities were also disrupted in January-February by the pro-
delays involved in appointing an official manager,
Mr F. H. Edwards, who was previously the chairman and
managing director.
This move was the only alternative to the appointment of
a receiver by the company’s banker. Under the official man-
agement, the company, unable to meet its obligations, could
realise its assets while creditors’ demands were postponed.
Current trading has been stabilised at around break-even
level since March, Mr Edwards reports.
Grounds for Crowing
JjjxPANDiNG at an almost unbelievable rate, Melbourne-based
Golden Poultry has announced plans to make another
one-for-five issue to shareholders. It will be made in March
to help finance expansion in the latter half of the current
financial year. This will be the group’s second one-for-five
issue within 12 months. Profit in 1964-65 jumped 40 p.c. to
£139,000 after a 47 p.c. leap in sales.
Sales in the first months of the current year have been
higher by 41 p.c. and profits are also reported ahead of last
year. Despite the ever-increasing competition which the group
is meeting, demand has been maintained at a galloping rate
hy the drought, which boosted meat prices, making chicken
a better substitute than ever. On top of the normal growth
ln demand, the situation is straining the company’s resources
an d it must expand.
A turkey farm has been purchased, mainly in preparation
tor the coming Christmas season. Speaking conservatively,
Me introduction of turkeys last Christmas created a sensation
a nd the supply was about 10 p.c. of the possible demand. The
fornington chicken hatchery has been at capacity for some
time and a new one is being constructed at Frankston. It
should be operating before the end of the current year. A
new line, chicken pieces, has been introduced from the Somer-
ville plant which is already operating “above” capacity and
is undergoing expansion.
Waste of Booms
chairman of Brickworks Ltd (Mr W. K. Dawes) made
a good point at the annual meeting when he said that finance
for housing should cease to be a political plaything and instead
should be supplied on the basis of the community's reasonable
needs.
This would ensure that materials and labor were available
when required, thus avoiding the inefficiencies, speculation and
cost increases of boom conditions.
During the last year to June, Brickworks, and the industry
as a whole, enjoyed its best-ever selling and manufacturing
conditions. It does not expect such a good year again in a
long time.
The decline in home-unit construction had caused some fall-
off in sales of common bricks, Mr Dawes reported.
Fish Stories
T'una will be herded towards a huge £22,500 nylon net by
speedboats under a new purse-seine method of fishing
when a 450-ton vessel with all the latest fishing and naviga-
tion aids arrives in Australia for use by the South Australian
Fishing Co-operative Ltd.
Safcol expects to change the economics of the tuna industry
by importing this vessel from the United States. The purse-
seine method, using no bait, is not dependent on the sea tem-
perature being correct for the fish to bite, so the vessel can
fish off-season.
The increased production of tuna, which already is double
all other types of fish in Australia, may enable Australia to
re-enter the export market, at present dominated by Japan and
Peru.
US consumption of tuna is approximately ten times the
Australian, so there is plenty of scope in the domestic market
also—particularly while meat prices are inflated.
Safcol’s canneries in Melbourne and Port Lincoln will handle
the catch from eastern and southern waters.


Company Meeting
Wm. Haughton and Co. Ltd.
Extracts from the address given by the chairman of Wm. Haughton and Co.
Ltd., Mr R. F. Sanderson, CBE., at the annual general meeting of shareholders,
Tuesday, October 26, 1965.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: The
consolidated net profit from trading
activities for the year was £16,264, com-
pared with £183,797 for the year ended
June 30, 1964.
The conclusions which gave rise to this
result are discussed at some length on pages
four and five of the directors’ report.
With the figure of £16,264, which 1 have
quoted as arising from trading for the year,
there must also be included the other
separate items listed in the profit and loss
account on page 7.
The largest of these items is, of course,
the profit on the sale of fixed assets,
mainly in a wholly owned subsidiary. This,
together with the recoupment of deprecia-
tion on those assets, which had been
charged against previous profits, contributed
a total of £204,271.
After including all these items and after
providing for income tax and the exclusion
of minority interests, the consolidated
accounts of the year ended June 30, 1965,
show a net contribution of £214,796 to the
shareholders of Wm. Haughton and Co.
Limited, compared with a corresponding
figure of £140,367 for year ended June 30,
1964.
RECOMMENDATION
Important as has been this contribution
towards our financial strength, your direc-
tors are of opinion that it would be im-
prudent at this stage to distribute to ordin-
ary shareholders funds which were not
earned as normal trading profits, and hence
we recommend, with regret, that no ordin-
ary dividend be paid.
After the payment of the usual preference
dividend, which you are asked to confirm,
we shall be left with an overall increase of
£196.240 in the reserves and undistributed
profits of the group.
A year ago I mentioned that it had been
one of our prime objectives to improve the
working capital position, and I am gratified
to be able to report that over the year the
net surplus of current assets over current
liabilities has more than doubled to
£521,096.
Your directors do not expect that share-
holders will be satisfied with the group’s
performance; but we do expect that you
will derive some confidence for the future
from the fact that in one of the most dif-
ficult trading years of recent times, your
company was able to maintain stability
and at the same time to carry on un-
checked its plans of reorganisation.
GREAT CHANGES
The year was one of great change for
the group. The reorganisation in London
and Bradford was completed, wool opera-
tions in • Fremantle were wound up on a
satisfactory basis and the hide business,
which had been a problem for some years,
is now in a position where profits are being
made on a greatly reduced investment.
During the year, our office building in
Jamison Street, Sydney, was sold at a satis-
factory price, and on terms which safeguard
our tenancy for many years ahead.
A further contribution to liquidity will
be made, in due course, by our decision to
dispose of the valuable freehold store at
Pyrmont, Sydney, which has been rendered
surplus by the transfer of our sheepskin
packing operations to Brisbane and Mel-
bourne.
Meantime our store property in Brisbane
has been sold since the end of the financial
year at a satisfactory figure, and a larger
and more efficient, but less costly operation
will be begun in new premises to be erected.
Our Victorian merchandise business is
now on a sounder basis, because we have
eliminated the uneconomic elements in our
country selling.
EXPANSION AIM
I am keen to emphasise, at this point,
that the various changes referred to are
constructive.
We aim to expand our business, not to
contract it: and we shall do this by increas-
ing activity in profitable sectors whilst
pruning in the less profitable sectors.
Thus we need to be flexible and resource-
ful in deploying our funds where they are
most useful, and with this in mind, share-
holders may well read the changes of the
past year as an encouraging sign.
For all these developments, the group’s
principal investment remains in wool, as
buying brokers, merchants and manu-
facturers; and the earning of a sufficient
return on these funds is still our major
problem.
While physical changes have been in
progress, techniques of management ac-
counting have been steadily improved
throughout the group, and we have con-
tinued to find ways of cutting costs.
We are thus better placed to turn to
account any improvement in the commodity
markets themselves in which we are in-
terested.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
Looking now to prospects for the future,
it is difficult to foresee any marked im-
provement in wool prices, and it seems that,
excluding the effect of unforeseen inter-
national events, fluctuations will probably
take place within a narrower compass.
This should be to your company’s ad-
vantage. The effects of the serious drought
in Eastern Australia have been and are
being felt, and rainfall this spring is being
watched with close interest
Meanwhile, I can report that we have
traded satisfactorily in the year to date,
though, as always, interim reports of this
kind must be treated with caution.
It may be appropriate, perhaps, if I quote
again what I said last year in reference to
our half-yearly report in February:
“While the directors make these reports
as informative as they can, it is simply not
possible to provide a completely reliable
forecast, in February, of the course which
the prices of several commodities will take
through to June; and hence to be too
explicit about the first half year entails a
very real risk of being positively mislead-
ing about the second half year.
“In view of the trend of some quoted
companies, for sound reasons, towards
detailed half-yearly and even quarterly
profit reporting, I must state that, in the
view of your directors, this practice would,
if followed by us, be a disservice to share-
holders.”
RESERVE PRICE PLAN
The proposed Wool Reserve Price plan,
if implemented, should be of benefit to
your group if it has the effect of ironing
out exaggerated market fluctuations. It
would be inappropriate for me to canvass
here the pros and cons of the plan and
its likely impact on wool growers and on
the nation as a whole.
On a wider front, perhaps I may make
two comments. The first relates to the
problem of international liquidity, or the
restrictive effect on international trade of
a chronic shortage of pounds, dollars and
gold.
I will only say that unless this problem
can be solved soon, companies and countries
like our own are likely to suffer.
My second comment relates to the closer
trading relationships being established be-
tween Australia and New Zealand.
Operating as i f does in both countries,
your company stands to gain from the pro-
gressive removal of restrictions on trading
across the Tasman, as, I firmly believe, do
the citizens of both dominions.
APPOINTMENTS
Since the end of the financial year Messrs
D. H. Bennison (New Zealand manager)
and L. F. Overall (United Kingdom
manager) have been appointed associate
directors, and Mr W. P. Campbell was
appointed manager for New South Wales.
The company s staff have been unremit-
ting in their efforts, both in Australia and
overseas. On your behalf I thank them
warmly for their loyal and energetic ser-
vices.
R. F. SANDERSON,
Chairman of Directors.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Downward Pressures on Profits
Newbold could be over-valued
TTIor a stock that only a few years ago,
in a period of recession, was selling
at 315., the present price of Newbold
General Refractories Ltd shares of
around 12s. to show an earnings yield
of 7.7 p.c. could suggest an under-valua-
tion. One must feel (today) that the
price of 31s. to show an earnings yield
of 31 p.c. was somewhat ridiculous;
nevertheless, 12s. seems a rather violent
reaction.
Newbold’s main business is refrac-
tories. Although reference is frequently
made to the building division, it is un-
likely that this particular section con-
tributes a great deal to the group’s total
profit. In fact, Newbola is the only sig-
nificant local producer of refractories.
Most people would have drawn the con-
clusion that, with a near monopoly
position, Newbold should have been
highly profitable and therefore the shares
represented a good investment.
They would have needed to have had
some idea of the importance of refrac-
tories generally in the economy. If they
should have obtained copies of some of
the publications of the Refractories In-
stitute of USA and read them even
superficially, they could have become
quite excited by the prospects. Quoting
from one publication entitled “From
Firelight to Satellite”, we have: “As the
nation grows, the refractories industry
must grow with it. Industrial progress
and refractories are interdependent.”
They would also, perhaps, have noted
that the metals industries in the USA
took about 80 p.c. of home consump-
tion and that the metals industry in
Australia was starting a vast expan-
sion phase. Not only was BHP expand-
ing its productive capacity, but the
aluminium industry was getting under
way and expansion was taking place in
the refining and smelting of copper, lead
and zinc. Apart from the metals in-
dustries, considerable expansion of
capacity was taking place in the cement
industry and the brick-making industry,
which in the USA are the largest users
of refractories after the metals industries
and the glass industry. From this back-
ground, Newbold certainly looked as
though its growth prospects were of
the highest order.
The 1964 annual report and chair-
man’s address certainly did nothing to
dispel the illusion that an outside
observer could have created in his own
mmd. A large contract was on hand for
the supply of refractories to the new
coke ovens at Port Kembla amounting
to 10,500 tons. The directors’ report
then goes on to say: “Our consent has
been given to the contractors to import
the balance of the refractories required
to complete the contract.” Extensions
were nearing completion at the South
Australian plant, which would then be
able “to meet the demands for a wide
range of refractories when the steel in-
dustry is functioning at Whyalla”. Finally
the chairman concluded his address as
follows: “With industrial development
continuing in Australia, directors and
management were confident that New-
bold would continue to secure its fair
share of the available refractory business
to keep the refractory plants operating
at an efficient level, and consequently
looked forward to a satisfactory trading
result for the financial year now current.”
So far as the outsider is concerned,
nothing seemed to happen during the
year to change this outlook significantly.
What, then, was the reason for the 13 p.c.
drop in earnings which occurred? The
direct cause was a fall of 8.62 p.c. in
sales of refractories brought about, one
would guess, by a drop of 20 p.c. in the
sales of the special bricks used for the
lining of the steel converters. The build-
ing brick division had an increase of 15
p.c. in sales so, without knowing the
exact proportions between refractories
and building brick sales, we could per-
haps assume that a fall in total sales
of between 1\ p.c. and 8 p.c. produced
a fall in net after-tax profit of about 121
p.c. to 13 p.c. It can only be said that
this is rather worrying, as presumably a
bigger decrease in sales would have pro-
duced a much greater decrease in profits.
TpHERE can be no doubt that Newbold
participated in the full in the expan-
sion of the steel industry during the
’fifties. Net profit after tax seems to have
risen from about £40,000 in 1949-50 to
£341,000 in 1959-60. The dividend rate
increased from 7 p.c. to the present 121
p.c., and the company made a two-for-
five par issue in 1953, a one-for-four
bonus issue in 1955, a one-for-four par
issue in 1957 and another in 1958. Since
that time there have been no further
issues to shareholders and the dividend
rate has remained steady at 121 p.c.
In other words, so far as the share-
holders are concerned, growth ceased in
1958—seven years ago.
During this seven-year period the
company seems to have accumulated in-
vestments and cash of the order of
£352,000. At June 30, 1958, investments
at cost stood at £48,000 approximately,
while Commonwealth bonds and cash
totalled £145,000. At June 30, 1965,
investments stood at £248,000, while
Commonwealth bonds and cash were
£297,000. On the basis of cost, these
various investments (including the bonds
and cash) seem to have been earning
about 10 p.c. before tax. The market
value of these investments, even after
allowing for selling costs, would have
been about £1 million and one should
judge the return on this basis.
Because of the large purchases of
overseas materials which have to be
made from time to time, it may well be
desirable for the company to hold some
substantial cash reserves. It is much
more difficult, in my mind, to justify
the holding of the investments for, if
they were sold for, say, £675,000 net,
the addition of about £90,000 cash would
permit the return of about 2s. per share.
The effect on earnings and “cash flow”
from the giving-up of the investment
income would be negligible. In the 1964-
65 year it would seem as though this loss
would have been about £29,000, thereby
reducing earnings to around £324,000.
This would have meant an earning rate
of 28.4 p.c. on an ordinary capital
reduced to £1,140,000, instead of the
present earning rate of 18.6 p.c.
This particular aspect of over-capital-
isation seems relatively minor as com-
pared with the problem of obtaining
sufficient sales to avoid the downward
pressures that appear to exist on profit
margins. One can only guess that com-
petition stems from imports, but whether
this competition takes the form of price
competition or quality competition it is
impossible to say. At this stage, New-
bold’s shares could even be over-valued,
it some shareholder benefits are not
received soon.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Much Brighter Grey
Problems of a new factory
In common with most other operators
in its field, Melbourne-based J. S.
Grey Industries has seen a substantial
increase in profitability over the last
two '{ears. From its factory in Lygon
Street, East Brunswick, the company
produces paper bags and semi-transpar-
ent wrappings for ice cream, sweets, etc.,
and acts as a wrapping-paper merchant.
From the low 12 p.c. earning rate of
1962-63, profits recovered to equal 21.5
p.c. on capital in the latest year to
June 30. Moreover, the group is in the
midst of further expansion.
Operations have been going for more
than 50 years now. In 1930 a pro-
prietary company was formed and in
1961 the public company came into be-
ing. Listing was effected through a share
placement by the newly formed holding
company. The family nature of the com-
pany is still predominant, as evidenced
by the current board of Messrs W. G.
Coates (chairman), J. S. Grey, H. C.
Grey, R. R. Grey and L. G. Brown.
The accompanying table reflects the
ill-timed public float. Profits immedi-
ately went into a downswing as the ef-
fects of the credit squeeze brought them-
selves to bear. However, the big recov-
ery in 1963-64 was not entirely due to
the easing credit conditions. In fact,
they played only a small part. The main
factor was the installation of a new
bag-making machine. And the fact that
further expansion plans are currently
under way augurs well for the future.
During 1964-65 an additional bag-
printing unit was installed. It enabled
improved production facilities, although
its benefits were not available for the
full year. A second machine, now on
order, will be installed early next year.
Thus profits in the current year will
benefit from a full 12 months’ operation
by the first machine and a few months'
operation by the second.
Although the rise in profit was rather
small in the latest year, the group was
subject to much higher costs and keener
competition. Moreover, there are severe
limits placed on its abilities by the rel-
atively cramped Lygon Street premises.
For this reason, work has commenced
on a new factory at Reservoir. All activi-
ties are expected to be transferred to
the new site next March. What effect
will this new project have on the group?
On the adverse side, the accompany-
ing table shows that the project has
forced the group to resort to long-term
loan capital for the first time since list-
ing. However, this is not necessarily a
bad thing. The sum is not large and it
has been borrowed from the group’s
bankers. More than anything it reflects
the lack af working capital which has
been a characteristic of the balance
sheets for some time. The balance of
capital requirements not covered by the
bank loan should be met by the pro-
ceeds from the sale of the existing fac-
tory freehold.
Beneficially, the new factory will
knock down the great majority of th e
factors which have hindered the groups
progress to date it will give greater
economy, better conditions, more room
for expansion, etc. There is no greater
proof of this than the one-for-four par
issue announced by the directors with

the year’s result. This is the first issue
since listing It will raise £48,000 to
finance the extra expansion of markets
which the new factory will help gener-
ate and provide a more adequate sum
for working capital.
Of course all these benefits will not
necessarily accrue in the current year.
In fact, profits could be seriously affected
by the move, especially if there is a
period of time over which the two fac-
tories will have to be kept in operation.
Again, there is no guarantee that the
old freehold will be sold quickly and at
a satisfactory price. Whatever happens,
shareholders should remember that any
decline in profits in the current year
will be only temporary. By the end of
1966-67, the group will have emerged
stronger than ever.
Even with temporary setbacks, there
should be no problems in maintaining
the 10 p.c. dividend rate on the higher
capital. The 1964-65 profit would have
represented more than 17 p.c. on higher
capital and profits are still growing. By
the time the shares rank for a full 12
months’ dividend, profit should have ex-
panded to the extent where the effect
on earning rate will be practically nil.
The table shows a fairly steady trend
for current assets and a slight decline in
current liabilities. Working capital has
risen, although it is still a little low.
Fixed assets show steady growth and will
jump considerably with the new factory.
Intangibles, representing goodwill, could
do with writing back as they are a lit-
tle high in relation to the rest of the
balance sheet, giving shareholders’
funds a large intangible element. Ordin-
ary capital, steady for so long, will rise
to £240,000 after the issue. Loan capi-
tal is not high, yet neither are reserves,
although their rate of growth has im-
proved substantially.
Depreciation can be expected to rise
with the new factory; tax may benefit
from the Government’s investment al-
lowance, offsetting any lift in deprecia-
tion for one year at least. Profits are
on the upswing again, surpluses are ris-
ing and so are earning rates. The group
is a steady dividend payer. Reflecting
this, share prices have always remained
at levels permitting an attractive return
from the dividend.
To sum up: the ss. shares are cur-
rently selling at about 7s. 6d. “e*
rights”. At this price they yield an at-
tractive 6.7 p.c. from the well-covered
10 p.c. dividend. The stock is prob-
ably one to buy and put away. Expan-
sion in the future will lift share prices
and possibly necessitate more issues. To
the more adventurous, the rights may
offer a cheap entry from time to time
and there is always a very strong pos-
sibility of a takeover by one of the

CONSOL. METAL PRODUCTS LTD
Some Growth
Qualities
jrViRECTORS of Consolidated Metal Pro-
ducts Ltd give shareholders two
months in which to chew over the results
of trading for the year before the chair-
man provides any comment on trading
conditions.
True, shareholders have the published
accounts to peruse. Since profits have
escalated from £134,313 to £246,613,
when prior to 1964 they were more in
the range of £90,000 to £lOO,OOO, it
seems a pity not to feed investors’
appetite for news.
The directors’ report accompanying
the accounts is simply a straightforward
listing of figures on profits, dividends and
reserves.
The trading result was 33.2 p.c. on
average capital employed (although the
funds from the one-for-five issue at 50
p.c. premium were not received until
June 14, the new' shares ranked for the
final dividend of 6i p.c.), but earning
rate was 30.5 p.c. on final capital of
£BlO,OOO.
The company, incorporated in 1950,
supplies lead alloys and lead by-products.
Its chief market is the lead acid storage
battery for motor vehicles. The pros-
perity of the motor industry in the year
under review was undoubtedly a major
contributing factor to the splendid result;
these prospects for the coming year are
not so rosy.
• A fall in lead prices can necessitate a
write-down of stocks. The trend has been
U P in the last couple of years, causing
no upsets.
In 1960 the company acquired New
England Antimony Mines NL to main-
ly 11 the Australian supply of antimony.
It supplies antimony concentrates and
antimonial fines from Guyra and Mar-
rickville (NSW). The cost of developing
the mine by June 30, 1965, totalled
£113,210, of which £63,210 had been
amortised.
Up to 1960 the company had a large
investment portfolio spread over more
than 50 public companies, mainly in the
metal and chemical industries. It has
since disposed of most of these, a major
exception being the 50,000 shares in
Electrical Equipment of Australia Ltd
which it acquired by selling Swiftsure
Pty in 1953-54.
Contrary to general practice, Con-
solidated Metal has written this invest-
ment up very fully in the books, adding
an extra £22,066 to visible reserves. In-
vestments, at valuation, now comprise
£54,140 in listed companies, £87,385 in
other companies, £82,968 in secured
loans, and £72,090 in an advance to an
associated company.
In March, 1961, the company made
its first major move outside metal in-
terests to acquire the Grasslands group
of farm machinery manufacturers and
distributors. It later obtained agencies

In New Zealand a subsidiary acquired
in January, 1964, makes Rokfire storage
batteries.
During 1963-64 Consolidated Metal
moved into a joint venture with Keith
Engineering (Sales) Pty to render
animal by-products down to tallow and
meatmeals. The company explained that
the process of scrap smelting and render-
ing were not dissimilar. By September,
1965, the sale of the fixed assets of this
subsidiary, Tallowmasters Pty, was an-
nounced, resulting in a substantial capital
profit.
Since 1951 Consolidated Metal has
earned profits annually. The minimum
distribution to shareholders was 8 p.c.
in the first two public years.
Prior to last year’s premium issue,
funds were raised by par issues in March,
1955 (one-for-seven), in May, 1957
(one-for-eight) and in May, 1959 (one-
for-nine). Coinciding with the last par
issue was a two-for-r.ine bonus from
asset revaluation.
The 84 p.c. lift in profits made the
increase in dividend from 11J to 12)
p.c. an easy exercise even if it was
generous to pay the final dividend on the
new scrip only just issued before balance
date.
At 30s. 3d. the 10s. units now return
4.1 p.c. in income and 11.0 p.c. in
earnings. As an investment, the stock
is changing character, showing qualities
of a growth stock. But its tie with
world lead prices and the automotive in-
dustry still gives it vulnerability.

THE UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Appointments in Anthropological Linguistics
The University, in conjunction with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal
Studies, has pleasure in inviting applications for the following appointments
which will become available in the Department of Anthropology as from the
beginning of 1966:
(1) SENIOR LECTURESHIP —salary range EA3250/110/3800 p.a. plus superannuation
similar to F.S.S.U. and an allowance for fares and removal expenses. Candidates
should possess a doctoral degree or its equivalent, experience in conducting
independent research and should be trained in both Anthropology and Linguistics.
The appointee will be expected to teach Anthropology Linguistics at both under-
graduate and graduate levels, to supervise research in Australian Aboriginal
languages or in some other area within the broad field of Anthropological
Linguistics. Preference will be given to applicants who have had some teaching
experience in this field.
(2) RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP—saIary range EA2400/110/3170 or EA3250/110/3800
p.a. depending on qualifications and experience, plus return fares (if required). The
appointment will be tenable for two years with the possibility of extension. Candi-
dates should possess a higher degree in Linguistics and preference will be given
to applicants with anthropological training and experience in recording and
analysing traditionally unwritten languages. The appointee will be expected to
conduct a research programme in Australian Aboriginal languages and, where
applicable, supervise research students.
(3) POSTGRADUATE RESEARCH SCHOLARSHIPS—Iiving allowance EAIO7O or
EA1165 p.a. depending, respectively, on whether work is done towards an M.A.
or a Ph.D. degree. Married scholars with dependants will receive additional
allowances (normally EA2SO for wife not in employment and EAIOO for each
child). In addition, return fares (if required) will be paid. The scholarships
(maximum of 3) will be tenable for one or two years with the possibility of
extension. Candidates should possess a degree in Anthropology plus linguistic
training, and should be willing to undertake work toward a higher degree in
Anthropology specializing in Linguistics. Appointees will be required to present
a thesis upon an Australian Aboriginal language hitherto unrecorded or in-
adequately recorded.
Intending applicants are requested to obtain details of the procedure to be
followed in applying for the post and a copy of the conditions of appointment
before submitting their applications. This information is available from the
undersigned with whom applications close on 30th November, 1965.

Registrar.
SPECULATOR'S DIARY
Putting a Value on Kelman
And how to dodge MLC panic
IS Mr Kelman worth three million pounds? That’s apparently what the market
thinks, since the market capitalisation of CSR increased by that amount in two
days after the announcement of his appointment to the company. Mr Kelman has
made such a favorable impact on financial circles in the United Kingdom that CSR
shares will probably be in constant demand in that country.
The sudden rise in CSR shares and
rights came a few days after the jump in
the MLC share price from 655. to 70s.
On hearing the news that H. G. Palmer
had been placed in receivership, my first
reaction was panic. On further con-
sideration, it seemed the best thing that
could happen to MLC at this stage. Of
course the MLC holding company will
not be receiving dividends from H. G.
Palmer any more. Nevertheless, the in-
come from other sources—in particular
the dividend from its wholly owned sub-
sidiary, the MLC Assurance Co. Ltd —
is quite sufficient for the dividend rate to
be maintained.
Some authorities have expressed con-
cern about the reduced asset backing.
Just what are book assets, though? A. J.
Benjamin had a book asset-backing well
in excess of the issued capital, yet the
shareholders still won’t get anything
back in the final settlement. Conversely,
the asset backing of Is. 2d. on the ss.
Macquarie Broadcasting shares (now
being placed at 7s. 6d.) does not seem to
have deterred too many investors.
Initially, I was hoping that MFC
shares would drop down into the low
sixties so that I could pick up 100.
Instead, they started from 655. and
steadily moved up to 70s.
What finally became my first purchase
for the week was 100 Tableland Tin at
38s. Tableland can probably be labelled
my most successful stock over the years.
Why the shares go through such wide
swings defies my understanding. I’m
happy provided I can buy on the down-
swing and sell on the upswing!
This year should be a particularly
good one for Tableland. For the first
sixteen weeks of its financial year, 366
tons of tin concentrate have been mined,
just 100 tons more than for the same
period last year. The average tin price
for the financial year would be just under
£stglsoo, which is a little higher than the
average last year. More importantly, the
costs per cubic yard are expected to be
considerably lower than last year.
For most of last year, the dredge was
in particularly hard ground so that costs
per cubic yard rose from 29d. in 1964
to 56d. If costs had remained constant,
the total costs would have been £240,000
lower.
From a company paying one of the
highest dividends on the market, I go
to one paying no dividend at all. Tyree
Industries is forgoing its usual dividend
and instead is making a l-for-10 bonus
issue. The motive here is to conserve
funds. Although Tyree has just finished
a record year, in which profits rose 17
p.c., the current expansion programme is
eating up all available funds. The ideal
investment here would be 1000 shares,
which would result in my getting an even
100 bonus shares. That being slightly
beyond my resources, 1 settled for 200
shares at 21s.
My two purchases were financed by
the sale of Cresco and William Adams
rights. Esso took sympathy on Cresco
shareholders (including one very recent
one) and came in with an 80s. bid The
market immediately moved up to 81s.
and I sold, clearing £2l. The William
Adams rights were sold at 6s. 10d., also
resulting in a very neat profit of £27.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
50 Cresco, 81/- £l9B
500 W. Adams rts, 6/10 £166
BOUGHT
100 Tableland Tin, 38/- £195
200 Tyree, 21/- £215
Now only £3 in debit!

You mean a white shirt, night?
t how much cuff do you show?
None at all if you’re like most men. How much should
you show? Exactly half an inch. True, it's not a lot, but
it makes all the difference betwe-en just looking
dressed and well-dressed.
That’s why we designed this Smartstay shirt with a
French cuff in three perfect sleeve lengths. The re-
sult? It fits smoothly and reveals just the right amount
of cuff. A half inch measure of your good taste. And
we should add, it’s styled with a continental flair
The collar? A straight-forward, let’s get down to busi-
ness look when it should. Rather suave and a little
dashing when it shouldn’t. The fabric? An imported
spin-dry cotton for easy laundering. The cost? 49/11.
