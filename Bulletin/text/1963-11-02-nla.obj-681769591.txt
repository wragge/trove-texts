Better building starts from the floor. Modern vinyl floorings are deep in colour, easy to clean, scuff and scratch
proof. Because they’re made with Geon, their pore-free surface is resistant to dirt, dust, oils and solvents.
Today, more and more manufacturers are using Geon in vinyl asbestos tiles, flexible vinyl tiles and sheetings.
In any industry, Geon’s versatility helps break the stalemate to product improvement. Have you a product we
can improve or develop?

National Notebook
The Intellectual Desert
‘TThe English intellectual scene is a
A desert,” said Peter Owen, a visiting
publisher from London, as we lunched
with him the other day. “There are
practically no writers there of conse-
quence now. Certainly, there is nothing
in the contemporary poetry. And no one
reads it at all.
“Novels only get sold to libraries. And
this is the only form of creative writing
one can afford to publish at all. No
single ‘line’ is really big in England. No,
travel books are finished. You keep try-
ing to find a formula. If it weren’t for
the Commonwealth market a lot of us
would be forced out of business.
“But even there we’re in trouble. The
Americans are getting in everywhere, and
they’re often using unscrupulous
methods. In India, for instance, they’ve
moved in and we haven’t realised it.
“And in Australia they may,” Mr
Owen added gloomily, “be coming in
to push us out, too.” One of the few
independent one-man publishing firms to
have stayed in business (among casual-
ties of recent years, Rupert Hart-Davis,
John Lehmann) Peter Owen publishes
a daringly highbrow list,
including works by Anais
Nin, William Butler, Wil-
liam Goyen, Cesare Pavese
and Machado di Assis.
Purpose of his visit here
has been to help shore up
defences against the com-
ing American invasion, as well as to
meet booksellers and writers. “I want to
find new Australian authors of talent,”
he says.
The Agency Man
Japanese marketing authority
Dr Kinichiro Saito painted for us a
picture that would send local ad-men
running up the wall. In Australia for the
Eighteenth Annual Convention of the
Australian Association of Advertising
Agencies, Dr Saito said that the Japanese
businessmen had a say in most publicity
campaigns.
“Here, as in the US, agencies make the
advertising plans,” the neat, unobtru-
sive doctor (he is research director for
J. Walter Thompson’s Tokyo bureau)
told us, “in Japan the advertisers gene-
rally make the plans and leave the agen-
cies to carry them out.”
He said that agencies also handle com-
peting accounts and so far there is little
connection seen between advertising and
marketing. “In the colleges art students
take advertising as part of their sylla-
bus,” he said.
Nor is there anything so irrevocable
as set rates. “Of course all agencies
announce their rates, but these are always
subject to negotiation. The actual rates
paid are usually about 30 or 40 per cent
lower than the official rates,” he said.
“As with most things in Japan, a great
deal depends on personal relations.” As
Dr Saito spoke we visualised an ad-
vertiser and an agency man sipping
tea and discussing flower arrangements
before reaching accord on a rate for a
summer campaign in which all faces
would be saved.
Foresight
rpo buttonhole a Nobel Prize winner
earlier than anyone else is one of
the minor triumphs of a journalist’s life,
especially a Swedish journalist’s. A week
before this year’s Nobel Prize for Medi-
cine was announced a Swedish corres-
pondent was advised by her paper in
Stockholm, in all secrecy, that it was to
be awarded to an Australian, Eccles, who
was somewhere in Venice.
She rang hotel after hotel until she
got on to the Savoia Jolanda. “Ekless?”
the hotel porter answered,
“the Nobel Prize winner?
Yes, he is here”.
As Sir John Eccles’
name had been mentioned
in the previous three years
as a likely prizewinner the
travel agency-which book-
ed him in apparently took the liberty of
presenting him as a winner.
Sir John did not want to go through
the interviews and suspense of the pre-
vious years which ended with the Nobel
in some else’s hands. He had come from
Rome where he had attended the annual
plenary session of the Pontifical Academy
of Sciences and was relaxing in Venice.
The Swedish correspondent broke the
news to him and presented him with a
bunch of cyClgfpens when he returned
to the hotel wj®fejfs wife at 1.30./'Half
an hour announcement had
been made in .Stockholm.
Sir John will return to Canberra,'then
he would be in Sweden to receive the
prize on December 8. For the moment,
however, although the phone kept trill-
ing in his room, he went for a walk in
the autumn sunshine in the city which
seems less real than any other. Back at
the Savoia Jolanda the hotel portet was
answering the phone as he had the week
before “Eckless? Yes, the Nobel prize
winner.” Then he would add, 'M’m sorry
but he is not here just now.”

Home in the Hills
T>risbane’s two papers, the “Courier”
** and the “Telegraph”, which quietly
married into the Melbourne “Herald”
family in 1956, are living together openly
at last. They have just moved into a
modern news-pictorial home at the near
northern suburb of Bowen Hills. Already
Brisbane people cherish “Bowen Hills
Souvenir” editions of each paper, as
alike as devoted sisters ought to be.
Until last week, the pre-1956 com-
petitors stood discreetly apart, the “Tele-
graph” at the southern, or smarter, end
of Queen Street, and the “Courier”
opposite the GPO. For several years,
after their annexation by Melbourne,
the two ignored each other. They com-
peted in bright chatter about the unique
charms of Sunny Queensland, because,
as their staff men would tell you,
Melbourne head office didn’t always cor-
rectly estimate the fervor of Northern
patriotism.
But Melbourne had its influence and
Brisbane has been taught to take Mel-
bourne Aussie Rules with its sports re-
sults. Over the last few years, keen
amateur scanners of the “Telegraph’s”
columns have found more and more
Collingwood drain blockages in the
spare little spaces that used to be fed
on such things as CWA election returns.
There’s also a slight cloud on the
horizon too —the morning planes bringing
big supplies of the two Sydney dailies
to Brisbane are creeping back ever
nearer to Brisbane’s home-delivery hour.
Speed Merchant
Tt might have been reassuring for those
who are nervous on Australian roads
to talk to Craig Breedlove, American
holder of the world land-speed record,
and learn that he was nervous before his
run of 428 miles per hour last August.
However, Breedlove, who’s here on a
promotion tour, then made clear that
there’s little resemblance between his
three-wheel vehicle “neither car nor
motor-cycle” and the ordinary sedan.
“If you pointed the nose of the car
at a slight angle there is no doubt she
would fly,” he said. “It is not equipped
with lifting services, but I believe it
could leave the ground.” The tyres (one
of which was flown here for Breedlove’s
visit) are entirely smooth. The car is
first braked down to about 200 mph
with a drag parachute before normal
brakes are applied.
Interstate Visitor
1%/fRS Edna Everidge of 33 Humor-
esque Street, Moonee Ponds (Vic.),
turned up in Perth recently and
promptly set about putting the town
right. In a letter published in the
“Daily News” she deplored the lack of
cultural activities in Perth. In Moonee
Ponds, she said, the young married
women had basket-weaving, pottery,
sculpture and “the lighter side of
classical music” to interest them. Mrs
Everidge urged the Perth girls to get
busy and “culture” themselves.
The letter incensed E. M. Willoughby
of West Perth, who wrote in pointing
to the fine art classes at the Technical
School, the Potters’ Club, and the arts
and crafts centre of the Country
Women’s Association. “I venture to say
that the Moonee Ponds young married
women would have to work hard to
better the standard set by many of the
Perth girls,” she wrote.
The polemics ceased abruptly when
somebody told the paper that Edna
Everidge left Moonee Ponds at least
three years ago fairly soon after the
curried egg sandwich was trodden into
her burgundy axminster. And in any
case Mr Barry Humphries has been in
London most of this year.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Credit Squeeze Bogey
And the Elections
tactics apart, Mr Calwell
has not yet made it clear pre-
cisely why the perfect balance now
existing in the economy will, in
the space of a few months, be suffi-
ciently upset by inflationary pres-
sures to warrant a credit squeeze.
To sustain his accusation that
Mr Holt would impose a credit
squeeze on the economy “early
next year,” he has first to prove
that one will be necessary. Nobody
will take very seriously Dr Jim
Cairns’ suggestion in the House
that one will be brought on by a
fall in capital inflow from the
United States as a result of Presi-
dent Kennedy’s strictures on the
export of capital. Such investment
is of marginal significance in our
economic equation, and good Labor
men like Sydney economist Ted
Wheelwright want to stop it anyway.
If Mr Calwell means that Mr
Holt is more likely than himself
or Sir Robert to impose a credit
squeeze if one is required, then
this is a tribute to the Treasurer.
Indeed, if anybody can claim to
be the architect of the present satis-
factory state of prosperous balance
in the economy, surely it is the
Federal Treasurer, who has stuck
to his slow but sure recovery
methods these last two years when
he was being urged on almost every
side to take more dramatic steps
to get full employment and a more
rapid rate of growth.
Nobody in his senses would sug-
gest that Mr Holt is any less an
anti-inflationist now than he has
been these last three years. It is
quite a different question whether,
despite the Treasurer’s efforts, in-
flationary pressures are now build-
ing up in the economy and will,
early next year, require contain-
ment by the authorities, whatever
the complexion of the Government
or its leader.
By common consent and not to
everyone’s (including Mr Calwell’s)
complete satisfaction, Mr Holt was
very careful in his recent Budget
not to throw unnecessary hostages
to inflation, at least in the way of
tax concessions one cannot be
too sure that the huge increase in
Government expenditure itself
doesn’t have inflationary implica-
tions, but hardly a penny of it has
been contested in Parliament.
Indeed, as the business world saw
it, Mr Holt was far too cautious
in his Budget, mainly because he
failed to take a more positive ap-
proach to the need to get a higher
rate of private investment. But,
rightly or wrongly, the Treasurer
took the view that private invest-
ment would rise in its own good
time as spending mounted from
other sources of income generation,
necessitated by more idle industrial
capacity being brought into employ-
ment, and making industry more
confident about the future profit-
ability of installing new plant.
TTIE Treasurer could not ignore
A the danger that, coupled with a
big rise in income from production,
exports and capital inflow, an up-
surge in private investment might
well prejudice price stability, not
to speak of straining available sup-
plies of labor, especially skilled
labor. The boomlet in shares in the
six weeks before the Budget sug-
gested that, given fresh incentives,
private investment might boil over
before the year was out and wreck
the Government’s plans-for orderly
growth without inflation.
Whether or not Mr Holt inspired
that boomlet, he certainly got its
message. For, though private in-
vestment is now a little more lively
than before the Budget, it is cer-
tainly very subdued compared with
what it might have been had the
Treasurer cut company tax, in-
creased investment allowances or
made other conciliatory gestures to-
wards it. The failure of share prices
to show any follow-Ihrough to their
pre-Budget rises suggested that pri-
vate investment intends to remain
sober, though it could become head-
ier after the election. At present it
seems to be edging up at a rate
compatible with stability, even given
the present buoyancy of income
generation from other sources.
Of these other sources the strong
flow of export income holds some
dangers as a destabilising influence,
but quite soon now one would ex-
pect the Reserve Bank to take the
necessary action to draw off into its
special account the rising surplus of
liquidity accumulating in bank de-
posits from the bumper export
season.
Income generation is also running
strongly in industry. But, curiously,
this has not yet been matched by
any big general rise in output. Pro-
duction is very patchy on its latest
showing, and, going on last month’s
big dip in bank advances and reduc-
tion in imports, industry appears
to have stopped stock-building. The
election itself could well increase
the present cautionary tendencies
in industrial production and stock-
building as well as in investment.
Should a more than seasonal
quiver in liquidity show itself, or in-
dustrial investment jump too confi-
dently ahead, any dampening re-
quired could easily be effected in-
directly by the Reserve Bank lifting
interest rates. Even now some ex-
perts believe interest rates might
creep lower, but Dr Coombs’ last
report made it clear that he now
possesses the weapon of flexible
rates in his hands.
This is widely held to be some-
thing of a triumph over Treasury
rigidity and austerity. Whatever the
tactical victories, however, it is
obvious that comprehensive, pain-
less monetary means exist to
correct most foreseeable disturb-
ances in the Australian economy.
So, though doubtless the next PM
and Treasurer, whoever they may
be, will have to be vigilant to en-
sure by early and appropriate action
that income generation does not
get out of hand, on present indica-
tions little more than the usual sea-
sonal precautions for mopping up
excess liquidity may be needed. A
certain credit squeeze early next
year is but a figment of the ALP’s
imagination.


THIS AUSTRALIA
THE ELECTIONS—I
Mr Calwell Jumps on
the Bandwagon
Labor listens to advice
BY A SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT
ARTHUR CALWELL
Three arms
IV/T R Arthur Cal well is fortunate in
having the advice of his university
friends in economic matters and of his
newspaper friends in matters of defence.
Both are very useful in pointing out
bandwagons on which to climb. He is
also getting a few clues lately from the
Opposition’s defence committee, which,
sensing the electoral possibilities, has for
the first time been actually finding out
something about defence.
In last week’s debate on defence (aris-
ing from its share of the Appropriations
Bill) Mr Cal well made a number of last-
minute additions to the party’s pro-
gramme. He said that he would establish
three new Army battle groups, one
armored and two mechanised. These
presumably would replace the three CMF
battle groups what would happen to
them? of the pentropic division, thus
making the whole division consist of
regular soldiers. That would be a very
good thing if the manpower could be
raised, since it would mean that the
whole division could be swiftly moved
to South-East Asia, instead of arriving
in stages with the regulars in advance
of the CMF soldiers. But to do this, on
Mr Calwell's own estimate, would require
an additional 14,000 men.
The Government is trying to raise the
numbers in the Army from about 23,000
at present to 28,000, and recruitment is
said to be going well. But it presents
no easy task at a time when a shortage
of labor is developing. To recruit a
further 14,000 would be difficult indeed,
the more so as Labor, clinging doggedly
to the myth that there is serious un-
employment, would, if elected, blow up
the economy still further and so make
the labor shortage greater.
Mr Calwell’s second bandwagon
was the demand for a new bomber for
the RAAF. In this he has been overtaken
by events, as he should have foreseen.
The Minister for Defence, Mr Athol
Townley, has brought off a brilliant coup
in Washington, by getting the Americans
to lend B 47-E bombers immediately,
on condition that Australia buys the
TFX reconnaissance bomber later.
Dilatoriness has paid handsomely. As a
result of having failed to order a new
bomber years ago, we shall not have
to pay for one at all until the TFX comes
along with the latest of everything
contour flying, movable wings, short and
rough take-off capability and so on.
Mr Whitlam (who has done his home-
work very well) has suddenly become a
champion of the British TSR 2, which he
said could have been delivered from
1964 onwards. In this he was mistaken,
but he was right in thinking that the
TSR 2 is more advanced than the TFX:
a prototype exists, whereas the TFX is
still on the drawing-board. The Amer-
icans, however, have promised delivery
in 1967, at the same time as the TFX is
delivered to their own Air Force. Mr
Whitlam felt that the choice of the TFX
needed explanation, but need one go
further than that the Americans were
prepared to lend a bomber to cover
Australia’s nakedness, whereas the Bri-
tish made no such offer with their V-
bombers? They simply haven’t got them
to offer despite rumours that they did
offer them.
Mr Calwell’s third bandwagon was
the demand for a strike aircraft-carrier
for the Navy. In this he was aware of
the rift that exists between the Cabinet
and the Minister for the Navy, Senator
Gorton, who has staked his reputation on
getting a carrier. But he chose his
words carefully, and they do not, on
examination, mean much. He said that
in this matter “we will accept the advice
of our defence advisers.” The Govern-
ment’s defence advisers as a whole are
against spending £125 million on a
single ship, and now that the RAAF
is to have its B 47-Es the case for a
carrier is further weakened.
It can no longer be argued that only
from an aircraft-carrier can bombers
reach Indonesia or the Sverdlov-class
cruiser which could menace Australian
shipping lanes. It is still true that another
carrier is needed to replace HMAS
Melbourne when her fixed-wing aircraft
go out of service or indeed while she
is refitting; it is true that even if ordered
now a new one could not be built in
time. But since Mr Townley’s success
with the B 475, the unworthy thought
creeps in perhaps if we are equally
dilatory over the carrier the Americans
will make us a small loan of one of
theirs. Meanwhile let us spend our
money on building up the escort fleet to
a less derisory size.
THE ELECTIONS—II
The Opening Salvoes
on Defence
Australia First?
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
SIR ROBERT
Probing
VI/'ith the big guns Prime Minister
** Sir Robert Menzies and the Opposi-
tion Leader Mr Calwell already ex-
changing testing probing salvoes, the lines
of battle for the Federal elections are
starting to become distinguishable.
You can almost see the way the minds
of the two men are working, as they toil
in their pre-election campaign gunpits.
Menzies wants the elections fought on
defence. He believes that this is Labor’s
weakness and relentlessly, with the con-
centration of an old political campaigner
who believes that victory lies in exploit-


ing your opponent’s vulnerability, he
keeps striking mercilessly at the one spot.
Calwell would prefer to fight the elec-
tion on other issues. He knows that de-
fence is a weakness as far as the Labor
Party, which he leads, is concerned.
He is trying to get out of fighting on
this issue but each time he has sought to
escape from the pocket of ground in
which Menzies has him trapped Menzies
has so far succeeded in keeping him pin-
ned down with ranging shots.
What about the economy and credit
squeezes? Calwell attacks. You, Menzies,
admitted in 1956 that the Commonwealth
lacked sufficient constitutional equipment
to deal with economic difficulties except
through the clumsy machinery of credit
squeezes. Why have you not sought the
constitutional equipment to deal more
efficiently with such problems? Is not the
implication in your inactivity that the
Government will again be imposing credit
restrictions and financial sanctions such
as those used by the Government in
November, 1960, and from which it has
taken the Australian economy three years
to recover?
Menzies counter-attacks by blithely
ignoring Calwell’s charges on the econ-
omic front and recalling what Calwell
and his party were saying about foreign
affairs defence and allied subjects. By
these tactics he forces Calwell back to
discussion of the subjects that Calwell
would prefer not to have discussed.
But in discussing these subjects that he
would prefer not to discuss Calwell is
showing a certain skill.
As the leader of the Labor Party he
has no problem or difficulties on domestic
defence. His difficulty arises from the
fact that the Government insists: (1) That
Australia, as a small nation of European
origin dedicated to the parliamentary
concept of government and isolated in an
area of the world in which Communism
has made significant advances, risks sur-
vival if it does not have allies; (2) For a
variety of reasons including Australia’s
geographic position and its alignment
with the non-Communist Western world
the US is obviously the country to which
it should look for support and association;
(3) Australia’s fate will be decided out-
side its shores and as part of the world
struggle and it is upon the presumption
that its fate will be decided in areas re-
mote from the Australian mainland that
its defence should be based. These are
all external defence factors.
The Right-wing of Mr Calwell’s party
would agree with all these propositions.
But Labor has a Left-wing which does
not agree with these propositions and the
Left-wing federally is at least as strong,
probably stronger, within the ALP
machine.
How then to deal with the situation
without producing discord within the
Labor Party that would inevitably mean
electoral defeat?
To Calwell the answer obviously is to
concentrate upon local defence.
The ALP Right-wing cannot object to
this policy. It wants defence. The Left-
wing does not object to it.
For those among the Left-wing, who
have Marxist leanings or sympathies, it
neutralises Australia in the world
struggle.
It builds up defence forces but those
defence forces have no significance in the
world struggle.
T>y the time it became necessary to use
** these forces it would be impossible
to use them. The world struggle would
be over and Australia’s future would be
decided by forces too great to contem-
plate opposing head on.
For those among the Labor Left-wing
who are influenced by genuine good-
will and not by Marxism the position is
a little different. Their ideal in inter-
national affairs is Non-Commitment.
They do not want to be committed to the
American side, which they have to be if
Australia is to continue as an active
member of the non-Communist Western
world. The India of the period before it
was attacked by Communist China is still
their ideal and oddly the fact that India
was proved wrong in believing that all
men and particularly those controlling
the Communist power were men of good-
will has made very little difference to
their views. They are prepared to defend
Australia and, like the leaders of India
before India was attacked by Communist
China, they believe that it is possible in
this modern world to do the defending
without the assistance of what Menzies is
accustomed to refer to as “Australia’s
great and powerful friends” —the US and
to a less extent Britain.
Not only does Calwell prevent discord
within his party by putting domestic
defence above the Government’s concept
of defence in co-operation with “Austra-
lia’s great and powerful friends”, he helps
his party with the voters. He is following
a line that has a powerful emotional pull.
Equally importantly, he diverts attention
from the more difficult issues such as
Labor attitude towards Malaysia and the
terms on which it would allow the US to
operate its proposed radio communica-
tions centre at Exmouth Gulf.
In effect what he is saying is “why
should I talk about Malaysia?” “Let us
cross one hurdle at a time. What is the
sense in talking about defending Malaysia
until we are sure we can defend Aus-
tralia?”
What he is ignoring in putting forward
this line is what is basic to the Govern-
ment’s thinking that Australia cannot
help Malaysia, nor in the ultimate defend
itself, unless it does both in association
with its “great and powerful friends.”
As I see it, the defence argument be-
tween the Government and Labor is
whether Australia’s defence is to be built
up externally or internally in co-operation
or in isolation.
It would seem that it is along these
lines that the coming election campaign
will be fought.
THE ELECTIONS—III
Three Riddles in Victoria
Has the image improved?
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
H. OPPERMAN
In danger?
rpHE question puzzling political observ-
"*■ ers in Victoria is whether the shift-
ing image of the Victorian ALP, despite
all its unpleasant history of the last eight
years, has done anything to convince the
swing voters that they can trust the
ALP.
The seats to watch on that Saturday
night next month to decide this question
will be the Melbourne seats of Mari-
byrnong and Bruce and the near seat of
Corio, which has as its centre Geelong,
The Bruce contest, however, has a
significance which is more than political,
The ALP s choice of Mr Barry Jones
as ts can< Jidate will turn Bruce into a
kind of sociological laboratory. Mr
Jones, 31, is a schoolteacher, a Methodist
lay preacher, an ALP branch official and
a regular delegate to the party’s annual
conference.


But above all he is the reigning TV
quiz champion and to countless numoers
of ordinary Australians better known
than any member of Parliament, not
excluding the Prime Minister himself.
Mr Jones has twice attempted to enter
the House of Representatives when he
ran for the Isaacs seat in 1955 and in
1958, but that was before his profile and
personality became familiar to millions
of TV viewers Whatever the outcome,
the vote in Bruce will provide lots of
data for future discussions of Admass,
the effects of TV, and twentieth-century
opinion-moulding.
Mr Jones has not always seen eye-to-
eye with the Victorian ALP executive
and it is a sign of this body’s growing
sense of realism that they selected him
for the seat. The sitting member, Mr
B. Snedden, has been in Parliament
since 1955, but in 1961 he had a majority
of 3637 after the distribution of DLP
preferences. On the first count, the ALP
candidate led by 859 votes. Bruce covers
a sprawling area of Melbourne’s south-
eastern suburbs, extending out to the
growing industrial centre of Dandenong.
By the time the rolls are finalised, there
will be close to 100,000 voters, with the
additional voters an unknown quantity.
On the other side of the city, in the
western constituency of Maribyrnong,
the Sitting Liberal, Mr Philip Stokes, is
certain to have another close fight. Mari-
byrnong covers Essendon and Moonee
Ponds and until Mr Stokes won it in
1955 has been represented by the former
Labor Minister, Mr Arthur Drakeford.
Mr Stokes has always had very narrow
wins and has needed DLP preferences to
get home. In 1961 he scraped in by 701
votes after these were counted.
The ALP candidate on that occasion
was Mr Armour, who is standing again.
In the past two years both he and Mr
Stokes have devoted a lot of attention
to the voters and a very close contest is
again certain. The DLP has put up its
star candidate for this seat ex-Senator
Frank McManus, now the party’s
national organising secretary and one-
time Victorian ALP secretary.
For light relief, Mr John Murray of
the Australian Republican Party is run-
ning. It is not known at this stage if
the Communists will nominate a candi-
date. Maribynong may be so close, how-
ever, that even the preferences of these
two groups could be decisive.
is held by the Transport Minister,
Mr Opperman, and he will be faced
by one of the ALP's most outstanding
new candidates, Mr Bob Hawke, the 1952
WA Rhodes Scholar economist-lawyer,
who has been ACTU Research Officer
and arbitration advocate since 1958.
Hawke's expertise on economic and in-
dustrial questions would be an asset to
any parliament, but in fighting Opper-
man he is at the disadvantage of not
being a resident of Corio, and in particu-
lar Geelong. Mr Opperman has held
Corio since 1949 when he beat the then
Minister for Postwar Reconstruction, Mr
John Dedman, by 235 votes. In 1961
he led by 641 after the first count and
won by 5890 after DLP preferences were
distributed. As with Barry Jones, Bob
Hawke has had plenty of publicity with
his name in the papers continually dur-
ing the big wages court battles, and this
will provide a puzzle for the analysts on
the worth of personal publicity. Labor
is optimistic about Corio, but realistically
the job may be too big for ever for that
tough fighter Mr Hawke.

TOBACCO
The War That
Wasn’t
Starving Widotvs
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
HThere was a price war in cigarettes
recently—or at least someone said
there was. There were newspaper post-
ers to testify to its reality and fighting
statements from Woolworths, Coles,
and others indicating that they would
fight the war to death. There were har-
rowing stories of widows in little kiosks
being threatened with starvation. There
was talk of “the gauntlet" being thrown
down and small shopkeepers committing
suicide “because they had no choice”.
The grim clash began with a statement
in Melbourne from Godfrey Phillips that
they would supply cigarettes to price-
cutting retailers. Hours later (in times
of crisis developments are rapid) came
a joint statement from W. D. and H. O.
Wills (Aust.), Rothmans, Philip Morris
and Godfrey Phillips, who announced
that their agreement not to sell cigarettes
to the price-cutters was null and void.
There were then meetings, lots of
meetings.
Then came, four days later, the first
big reductions from one firm in Sydney,
which did it in three of its 38 stores.
There were scattered reports of small
retailers cutting prices. Shopkeepers at
the Totem Centre in the Sydney suburb
of Balgowlah heard the war drums in
the distance and cut their prices by five-
pence a large packet.
Then a week later the war was over as
quickly as it had begun.
When it w'as all over, Tom the Cheap
Grocer was still selling his cigarettes
in several States, one firm had been added
to the handful of cheap outlets and no
retailers, despite those early fears, had
come to suicide or bankruptcy and, if it
came to that, no widows were starving.
What the whole phoney war had been
was an expression of tension between
the tobacco companies. Retailers were
saying that the big tobacco companies
didn’t trust each other on the leakage of
supplies despite the previous agreement
to the few cheap outlets and that the
statement had been an expression of
manoeuvrings between the companies.
While the taciturn tobacco companies
and the tactful officers of the bigger
retail bodies were not issuing any com-
muniques it was clear that enlightened
self interest had triumphed. Unless the
smokers wanted to travel miles to one
of the few cheap outlets in Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Adelaide or Perth (Brisbane and
Hobart have always been firm citadels of
fixed prices) the prices were the same.

AMOCO AUSTRALIA PTY. LIMITED
There’s a fallacy current among users of furnace oil,
industrial fuel oils and distillates that they are all alike.
In the factor of pour point alone, there are vast differences
between fuel oils. A fuel with low pour point will give
better atomisation at the burner and thus big savings
on pre-heating costs. A factor such as this can often be
overlooked when buying fuel oil on a “price” basis.
Amoco, too, are selling fuel oils at very competitive prices,
but being acutely aware of the problems, we have made
an extensive study of fuel oil needs and its supply to
Australian users. Our Technical Staff and Laboratory are
ready to ensure you get the right fuel to do the job.
Contact one of the Amoco Industrial Branches listed

THE NORTH-WEST
Mirage in the Kimberleys?
Melbourne-Sydney axis v. The West?
FROM JOHN GRAHAM IN PERTH
CHARLES COURT
Pioneer
Tfcß Bruce Davidson talks like a
machine-gun and thinks like an ad-
ding machine. He wears a crumpled
suit and a scraggly hair cut and sucks at
an ancient pipe.
This ebullient economist has been pre-
paring his tilt at that colossal political
windmill, the Kimberleys Ord River
scheme, ever since he resigned from the
CSIRO, because that body would not
publish his findings on the subject. They
will soon be published privately.
Now a visiting lecturer at the Univer-
sity of Western Australia, he made his
first charge when he addressed the Agri-
cultural Economics Society on cropping
policies on the Ord River. He began with
the bald observation that the subject
needed a psychologist and not an econ-
omist.
Though his language did not always
conform to the accepted academic pat-
tern, his arguments were impressive. He
claimed that neither from the aspect of
defence, population or economics could
the scheme be justified, and backed up
his arguments with some sobering
figures.
The quoted yield figures for Ord
crops, he said, were only based on ex-
perimental plots and had never been
obtained on a farm basis. If the ratio
of commercial yield to experimental
followed the normal Australian pattern,
they could be cut by about one-third from
those quoted in the official brochures.
These estimates did not take into account
the effect of insect infestations.
He was also gloomy about the long-term
price outlook for Ord farmers. He point-
ed out that current and projected schemes
in NSW and Queensland could satisfy
Australia’s domestic cotton requirements.
If this happened, the Ord crop would
have to be exported at the uneconomic
price of 6id. a lb.
Rice was a totally uneconomic crop on
the average yield of 15 cwt. an acre
so far obtained. Farmers on the MIA
were obtaining 2i tons to the acre.
Once the scheme had been developed
the subsidies on Ord crops could amount
to almost £3,000,000 a year for cotton,
more than £1,000,000 for safflower, and
up to £8,000,000 for rice.
Finally, he pointed out that the amount
of unused Crown land in the south and
north of the continent was almost equal
at about 30,000,000 acres. Why waste
money developing uneconomic northern
agricultural schemes at this stage?
The Minister for the North-West,
Charles Court, an equally ebullient figure,
came back at Dr Davidson the next day
with some highly political argument. He
categorised Davidson’s thesis as defeatist
thinking and claimed he had been seri-
iously misleading in his estimated crop
yields.
Backroom theories, he said, were no
substitute for front-line experience or the
pioneering spirit that conquered problems
instead of backing away from them.
Furthermore Dr Davidson was a sup-
porter of the Melbourne-Sydney econo-
mic axis.
When Mr Court claimed the support
of Dr Davidson’s boss, Professor E. J.
Underwood, head of the Institute of
Agriculture at the University of Western
Australia, he earned a mild rebuke from
the professor.
The findings of scientists and engineers
as well as the views of political leaders,
said Professor Underwood, must be sub-
ject to continual economic scrutiny if
Australia was to make the best use of its
resources and contribute to a hungry
world.
TRANSPORT
The American Dream
Heresy in the Eastern Suburbs
FROM RICHARD HALL IN SYDNEY
N. McCUSKER
Opposition
Dome observers have been drawing the
lines of division in the New South
Wales State Government over the pro-
jected £32 million Eastern Suburbs rail-
way along the classic city v. country
positions. But the truth is that the
strongest, and in the long run probably
the most influential, opponent of the
great vision (6.4 miles of track and 11
new stations) is the Commissioner for
Railways, Mr N. McCusker.
The opposition of the Railways De-
partment to the recommendations of
the American consultants, De Leuw
Cather and Company, raises the question
of the best form of transport to shift
large and increasing numbers of people
in peak hours out of the ever more
congested cities.
Administrators of public transport all
over the world have been hit by the
continually shrinking patronage of their
systems rail, tram or bus. Their re-
action has been to prune, cut costs, con-
solidate. This is virtually now dogma.
What makes the De Leuw Cather
report interesting, not only for Sydney
but for the other big cities, is that the
American-led team of engineers have
set themselves in heresy against this
dogma.
The report examined the present and
future needs of the eastern suburbs of
Sydney, with a current population of
about 366,000 and a predicted 22 per
cent increase by 1983. It curtly rejected
the suggestion that expressway buses
should be used to cater for the peak-
hour traffic because they could not
“operate fast, dependable and convenient
service”.
The engineers also rejected a
suggestion of a joint expressway and
surface railway. After considering
five alternative underground routes they
plumped for a line from the half-finished
Chalmers Street station, alongside
Central Station, through the city to turn
east at Martin Place, to Kings Cross,
Edgecliff and Woollahra before taking a
southward swing to end at Kingsford.
One of the flaws in the report, which
its opponents were quick to point out,
was its optimism about possible Federal
and Local Government help for the
capital costs.
The difficulties of finding £32 million
will be a strong argument, together with
Railways Department scepticism, while
the pros and cons for the new line are
argued out in the Cabinet sub-committee
and ultimately full Cabinet over the next
few months (nothing ever happens quick-
ly in the NSW Government).

ENJOYING THE INEVITABLE
There is nothing like an all-night
train trip to convince you that
romanticism is instantly curable.
Reared from childhood on stories of
Blue Trains, boat trains and Simplon-
Orient expresses, it comes as a shock
to find that trains are simply a time-
consuming means of getting from one
place to another. But in Queensland
the railway people are so kind you
feel a heel claiming a refund so you
can return south by air. “The train’s
nice and restful”, they say, tut-tutting
at the airways.
Nice and restful are good Queens-
land adjectives. There are pink Mr
Whippy vans carolling across the Bris-
bane suburbs, but after one good
smash-and-grab raid on the company’s
offices in August, the city felt it had
made token protest and settled back
to enjoy the inevitable.
At five in the afternoon at this
time of the year it’s warm, and you
have mad colonial desires to shout
Boy! in anticipation of long cold gins
on a shaded verandah. But, of course,
it’s impossible. Courtyards with Venus
flytraps and riverbed pebbles are big
around Kenmore and St Lucia, but in
most homes the verandah is either a
bare brick platform facing the street
(ideal for launching battleships), or
in the older homes, completely louvred
in to give Mum a place to hide the
ironing.
And where do you go for your long,
cold drinks? Never before has Queens-
land had so few pubs to go round
a mere 1134 to a population of
1,554,941 men, women and children,
or 1371 people per pub. In 1935, at
the time of the Liquor Act, there
were only 724 people per pub. Queens-
land’s licensing Commission Chairman,
Mr L. Kelly, says it’s a many-faceted
thing. Failing industries, faster trans-
port, and in the city, parking meters,
have all played their part.
In the last three years fires razed
45 hotels, mainly in country towns
where legend has it that drinkers
select Fire Day by democratic vote.
But the insurance company pays up,
the licence returns to pool, and
another pub is lost. Even in the city
it happens. The Australian, opposite
the City Hall, is gone, and the Grand
Central, long known to sailors, stu-
dents and slummers for its Passion
Pit courtyard, is becoming an arcade.
So Sydney visitors get taken to one
of Brisbanes updated pubs, like the
old National at Petrie Bight, which
has acres of thick carpet, subdued red
lighting, bar stools and quaint bar-
men. You can drink tequila, ring
up on red telephones and listen to
men talk about their analysts. Atmos-
pherically, you might have just as well
stayed at home.
Pub running in Queensland is a
chancy affair all round. Lennon’s
Broadbeach, once described by a Syd-
ney columnist as a vast Coptic tomb,
had lost a lot of its Durrellian opu-
lence. Queensland’s architects recently
held their annual convention there,
from necessity and want of the Chev-
ron, and everyone, including the archi-
tect who designed it, felt a professional
sadness.
ITPhe hotel has gone native. The wai-
ters wear floral shirts with hand-
written first name tags, the bathrooms
all have chainstore flysprayers, and
Hawaiian music bumps and grinds
relentlessly from concealed amplifiers.
At night, when the darkness draws in
around the dance floor and the waiter
gives you what he thinks is brandy in
an impressive balloon, it seems less
desolate. But outside, later, in the
treeless wastes of purple Buena Vistas
and chartreuse El Dorados, the three
a.m. wind never sounded sadder. If
all goes well, Lennon’s may be con-
verted into a hospital before too long.
Surfers Paradise also has a vege-
tarian restaurant, The Salad Table,
the founders of which run one of
Australia’s few organic farming ven-
tures. The farm, a recently cleared
half-acre of virgin timber and scrub,
is 70 miles from Brisbane at Spring-
brook, a kind of subtropical Blue
Mountains with tulip farms, waterfalls,
Devonshire teas and hairpin roads.
The half-acre has an embryonic or-
chard of peaches, plums, oranges,
blackberries and avocados, and a
patch of sturdy kitchen vegetables. On
the next-door plot is a professional
passionfruit grower. At weekends a
guard is needed to keep out snoopy
tourists, and the passionfruit man has
suffered particularly from two old
ladies in a white Jaguar, ostensibly in
search of wildflowers.
But the vegetarian people believe
they’re really after leaf mould, a rare
commodity in these times of synthetic
fertilizers. Organic farming was scien-
tifically developed in India last century
by Howard and MacCarrison, who
studied forms of crop nutrition be-
tween villages. The idea is to leave
everything to nature, worms and may-
be some seaweed, keeping the soil’s
natural balance unadulterated. Pro-
duce from the farm will be used at
the restaurant, and there are hopes
of building a sanitarium there, in the
best of all possible beauty spots, where
frazzled city folk worn out by smog,
grog and “Greensleeves” can recover
on raw foods and gentle attention to
the garden.
It may seem a small thing, but
Brisbane is sadly backward in that its
milkbars sell only milk no yoghurt
whips, no espresso machines, no juice
extractors. Just milk, mirrors,
chrome, aluminium and chocolate.
Some University students once sur-
veyed the city and discovered more
milkbars per block than any other
type of shop. Whatever the reason, a
genuine old-fashioned milkbar can
give the Southern visitor quite a thrill
of nostalgia.
Unashamedly in the nostalgia trade
is the Brisbane meanswear store, Hen-
derson’s, who earlier this year bid
5000 guineas for the Lord Mayor of
London’s gold coach to put in their
Adelaide Street shop window. Hender-
son’s already have a coach, tracked
down through nationwide advertise-
ments in a shed just outside Brisbane
for a mere £2O. Painted and uphol-
stered in gold to match the store’s
decor, the old coach once rode on the
Darwin to Adelaide run of the 1890 s.
If the Lord Mayor’s coach had come
good, the present model would have
been put on the streets as a horse-
drawn delivery vehicle, but Mr Hen-
derson is no heartless businessman.
He’s quite in love with his old coach,
and it’s very definitely not for sale.

THE CUP
1890 -now that really was a Cup year!
By BATMAN
There are one of two things in Mel-
bourne which are utterly sacred,
one of them is the Melbourne Cup.
Apart from anything else it provides us
with a public holiday which puts it very
high on the sacred list.
Several years ago a Sydney news-
paper, quite innocently, suggested that
it would be a good idea, just occasionally,
to run the Cup in Sydney. This would
give many people, who had never had
the opportunity of going to Melbourne,
of seeing the great race.
We were outraged. One reply read
like this: “Now in Sydney they’re trying
to pinch our Melbourne Cup, just
because they know it’s the best race in
Australia. Why don’t they leave us
alone? We’ve never tried to pinch their
Harbor Bridge!”
It was a point well taken, although
there have been times when we felt we
could use the Harbor Bridge. But why
did the Melbourne Cup become Aus-
tralia’s best race? It was hugely import-
ant almost from the beginning. In
Queen Victoria’s day Melbourne was
the biggest and richest city, but there
were other reasons. Partly it was a simple
fact of geography. Melbourne was in
the middle. Most horses came by ship
and it was much more difficult for
Adelaide and Hobart owners to ship
their horses all the way to Sydney.
And for the prime reason there was
the inspired Mr R. C. Bagot. He had a
hand in our two most deeply revered
institutions, Flemington racetrack and the
Melbourne Cricket Ground.
He was the first secretary of the
Victoria Racing Club, which began in
1864. He was an Irishman, and he had
the unique idea, for 1864, that racing was
for the working man. He built a blue-
stone stand for the cash customers that
was—for heaven’s sake —better than the
timber affair which had been provided
for the members.
Furthermore he drained the marsh in
the centre of the course and threw open
the Flat for free. All Melbourne could
come there for a picnic, a picnic that
was a real carnival. All Melbourne?
That’s barely an exaggeration; there was
never an entertainment for the masses
like this. Maurice Cavanough, the VRC
historian, has recorded that 100,000
were at Flemington for the Melbourne
Cup in 1880. The entire population was
only 282,000. So you see, better than
one in every three people were at the
races on that day. Over 80 years later we
have to struggle to make that figure now.
The population is over two million but
the crowd for 1962 was 91,239.
Flemington was, and still is, a superb
racetrack. Then best of all it is handy
to the city. In the old days you could
go by train, tram, public wagonette,
private wagonette, drag, carriage, han-
som, dogcart, lorry, van, covered trap,
omnibus, or, as one writer put it, the
mugs could go by foot.
The dust along the road was frightful,
so it was quite the thing to go by paddle
steamer, down the river. The Maitland,
for example, used to sport a nigger
minstrel band. This year you won’t have
much chance of going there by boat.
You’ll just have to put up with the heli-
copter.
Maurice Cavanough has yet another
reason for this adoration of the Mel-
bourne Cup, and racing in general. The
classic races in England have been
weight-for-age affairs; for three-year-olds
which all carry the same weight. The
colt, therefore, which wins the Derby
or the filly that takes the Oaks, clearly,
are the finest in the field.
So after these races they are retired
to preserve the line, to propagate further
champions. This was no good at all to
the working man. In the 1860 s Mel-
bourne was full of the Irish and the
Cornstalks, bred out of the goldrush.
They knew what poverty was like and
there was the hunger everywhere to get
rich quick. What odds could you get
out of a weight-for-age race? You just
had to look for the best horse and the
bookmakers knew this better than any-
body.
Ah, but the Melbourne Cup, spread
over an agonising two miles, was a

One, two, three, overdrive!
Lots of cars cruise at about 50.
Any faster and they get hot. They eat up
petrol, and the engine takes a beating.
(Count the cars along the roadside, any hot
day, letting, off'steam and cooling down.)
This doesn't happen in a Volkswagen,
and one reason is the top gear.
Volkswagen’s top gear is the same as the
extra gear you find in some expensive cars,
It's an overdrive.
At speed, the average car engine is going
faster than the transmission it drives. In
a VW, overdrive makes the engine go slower
than the transmission. So the VW is really
taking it easy—no matter how. fast it goes
or how slowly. And because the engine’s
always relaxed, so are you you drive
without worrying about straining the car.
And because the engine doesn’t strain,
' VW's clock remarkably high mileages.
Nor can the engine overheat. Or freeze.
It's air-cooled, and air doesn’t boil, like
water.
Nor can the radiator break down. VW
doesn't have one.
What Volkswagen does have,
most makers would give
m.illions to get.
Wonderful reliability.

completely unpredictable race. It still is
an unpredictable race. We can quote
you colts and fillies, three year olds, four
year olds, seven year olds no end, who
have won the classic. The favorite has
come home less than once in four and
the odds are splendid.
So Australians, who are known to
have a humble interest in gambling,
adore it. We are the only people who
put a handicap race on a pedestal above
all others, and, if you must have a
greatest, we rate the Melbourne Cup as
the greatest handicap horse race in the
world.
“Not a Blessed One of Them!”
Tt costs an owner at least £5OO by the
time he has brought his horse to the
starting barrier, what with feeding,
training and entry fees. It begins back
in the beautifully optimistic days of early
June, the time of the first acceptances.
Then it costs only £5 to nominate. This
year we had 417 entries with odd names,
some of which we may not see again
like Allez Oop, Mr Iceman, Kum Lucky
and Cul de Sac. The owners got the
prestige of having a horse entered for
the Melbourne Cup.
The VRC got the £2085 in cash.
For those who were still in it on Sep-
tember 24 there was the first acceptance
of £2O, then for the last handful there
was the final acceptance on October 31
of £120; a total of £145.
The prizemoney is £25,000 plus the
gold, three-handled loving cup worth
£750. It is not a big sum by world
standards and you couldn’t compare it
with the grand old days of the Melbourne
Cup. Take Carbine’s year, 1890, when
Melbourne was lousy with money The
VRC put up the prizemoney to £lO,OOO
and racing men in other parts of the
world could scarcely believe it. You
work it out. The working man earned
about £2 a week. To equal Carbine’s
year the VRC would have to put up
£lOO,OOO.
Now that really was a Cup year. As
Carbine returned the owner, Donald
Wallace, threw his arms around Carbine’s
neck and hugged him. It was a most
suitable emotion because not only had
Carbine provided the 10,000 sovereigns
first prize, but Mr Wallace had won
another 30,000 in wagers. The trainer,
Walter Hickenbotham, was so excited
that he plucked hairs from Carbine’s tail
and presented them to the ladies.
Perhaps, dear reader, you still possess
one of these valuable trophies, suitably
mounted in a silver frame.
Jockey Ramage told reporters: “I
wasn’t afraid of them, either before the
race nor while it was on, not a blessed
one of them.
“Neddies,” said he of the other horses
with contempt.
The “Age” for November 5, 1890,
reports: “Long before the No. 1 was
hoisted by the judge, in fact before the
champion had reached the winning post,
the spectators burst into wild expressions
of delight and admiration, as it could
be seen some distance from the post that
Carbine would have to fall down to
lose. As the clerk of the course escorted
him back to the weighing yard, winner
of the most valuable handicap race ever
run in the world (10,000 sovs), the scene
was one to be remembered. Inside the
enclosure the popular owner was
receiving the hearty congratulations of
Jus friends, and acknowledging the cheers
of the assembled thousands.
“By his great triumph in the Mel-
bourne Cup, Carbine has broken more
than one record in connection with the
famous event. He carried lOst. 51bs, a
weight never previously borne to victory
in a Melbourne Cup, and beat the best
time previously recorded for that race
(3 min. 28+ secs) by a quarter of a
second, whilst it is also worthy of
remark that the number of starters for
the Cup (39) had never been equalled in
any previous year. Indeed the more this
last great run of Carbine’s is considered
in detail, the more phenomenal does it
appear.”
The social writer of Melbourne
“Punch” reported that many “lovely
toilettes were worn by people of no
social status including barmaids and
bookmakers’ ladies.” Indeed, one bar-
maid won £25,000 in a lottery. Some said
that she looked even happier than Mr
Donald Wallace, and certainly more so
than Carbine. Although there are
chroniclers who point out that Carbine
was something of a ham. He always re-
fused to leave the mounting yard until
the last clap of applause.
That was Carbine’s year, but what
about this year? Even if you can’t stand
horses it’s a lovely way to spend the day.
No other sporting event is conducted in
such beautiful surroundings There are
acres upon acres of flowers, four row»
of them over half a mile long, all grow-
ing as exactly as they are told by the
VRC —roses, poppies, pansies, ranunculi,
cinerarias. . . .
From the grandstand the view goes
out for miles across to the skyscrapers of
Melbourne, to the dockland, across the
great green acreage of the course and
down to the Maribyrnong. Then there
are the flags, the green umbrellas of the
betting ring, the swirling color of the
crowd.
It all gets under way as the Governor
drives down the straight followed by the
massed Highland bands, more than 100
pipers, a tremendous sight.
In the members’ car park there are
more Rolls Royces than you could shake
a Mini Minor at. It is always de rigueur
in the car park to serve a chicken and
champagne lunch. A charming sight, of
which one never tires, is to see a
uniformed chauffeur, salad of ribbons
on his chest, quaffing champagne.
Then in the members’ stand there is
the Champagne Bar. Here they sell
champers for ss. a glass and chicken
sandwiches for 10s. a tray.
As for the ladies one can always get
away with rather more on Cup Day.
Hats are not expected to be believable.
One looks for the absurdities built upon
the head like threatening cumulo nimbus
or amazing wagon wheels with feathers
for spokes.
Every lady knows that newspaper
early edition time between 11 a.m. and
noon is the deadly serious time. You
either make it or you don’t make it. So
they parade back and forth, strike poses
on the steps. The tension gets tighter
and tighter. The photographers each
with a social writer at his elbow approach
across the lawn.
Oh, surely, surely, this time it’s going
to be me?
That Unnerving Grey Topper
'C'or the men the Spring Carnival is the
A last stronghold of tradition. At Eagle
Farm or Randwick men would blush to
their ears to do what they do at Fleming-

certain amount of nerve. Just once I
hired my morning suit and was delighted
to find two shillings left in the pocket by
the previous wearer. But I was a little
unnerved by the grey topper and kept
holding it in my hand.
It takes breeding and style to carry
off a topper with the right flourish.

bowler is all right for the Cup, but please,
a grey topper is a MUST for the Derby.
So you parade, across the lawn, to the
betting ring, and to the best place of all,
the bird cage. It is there that one dis-
covers afresh that there is nothing in the
world quite so beautiful as a thorough-
bred horse.
There is one major difference. This
year there is no Flat. It closed for the
last time on March 16, and now it is
a car park, a convenience for the modern,
mechanised racegoer, just yards from
the track. Until 1910 the Flat was free
and even this year it costs only 2s.
In the old days the Flat was a carnival
that went from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. There
were steam-driven merry - go - rounds,
Aunt Sally stalls, thimble-and-pea men,
three-card-monte and the Barrel Pole.
Yes, the Barrel Pole was popular. The
operator had a small colored pole he
threw on a table. You bet on which
color came face up.
The crowds came by furniture van
and dray. The horses wore headgear
bedecked with flowers. The crowds sat
on sacks and sang to the accompaniment
of piano accordions. The Flat was the
cheerful place, the real family outing.
Yet the betting was real and earnest.
Bookies could welsh at their peril. At
the Grand National meeting in 1906 a
bookie couldn't pay out winning bets on
Decoration. He had to run for it. The
mob chased him for 300 yards and threw
him in the river. He received such a
kicking and mauling that he died.
Two men were arrested, but after
evidence at the inquest, Coroner R. H.
Cole freed them and no one was ever
convicted.
On the Flat you would get the young
lairs with the long, greasy hair and red
cardigans, mothers with babies in prams,
and the old dears from Fitzroy, the ones
who really adore the races. Their know-
ledge of form would surprise you and
the Flat bookies used to accept their
shilling bets.
When the Flat Had 30,000
record Flat crowd was 30,000 in
A 1926 when Spearfelt won the Mel-
bourne Cup in front of 118,877 people.
However, at the finish crowds on the
Flat were down to less than 2000.
Flatgoers are expected to use the Hill
where the VRC has cut prices from
6s. 6d. to ss. Some of those old dears,
mentioned earlier, swore it was all over
for them, no Flat no racing. However,
the VRC has big plans for improving
the Hill which already is a pretty good
spot with stand, betting ring, bar and
seats among the trees.
There is one major problem which is
worrying the racing administrators. It is
the same problem that worries the
churches? Where has everybody gone?
In the Victorian and Edwardian era
racing was unchallenged as the recreation
of the masses. The whole country was
racing mad. The average racing crowd
at Flemington now is below 25,000.
Indeed you are doing well to get 20,000.
Look at that compared with Australian
Rules football. Any Saturday you like
to name they get a total of 150,000. In
the summer it is water skiing, surfing,
taking the MG up to the hills.
In 1961 Victorian racing attendances
dropped by 12} per cent. Last year the
attendance drop for all clubs was 7.6
per cent. Although the VRC claimed
that the attendance drop at Flemington
was .91 per cent.
Visit any racetrack and it is obvious
what has happened there’s hardly a
young face anywhere. The dividing line
comes at about 40, when no longer are
you chasing the fillies on the beach, when
your legs no longer speed you around the
tennis court and the distance between
holes at Yarra Bend and Albert Park is
becoming longer and longer. It is then
that you enjoy the social life at the races.
To get back to our expert, Maurice
Cavanough. Last April he wrote in “Aus-
tralian Letters” that nigh on 50 per cent
of racegoers today are Catholics. This
is because the Catholic Church doesn’t
condemn gambling and, apart from that,
there is the age-old Irish urge to gamble.
As one of the poorest of Western
nations, they looked to gambling as an
escape from poverty and the idea is well
ingrained in their descendants. The very
rich, particularly the rich gentlemen
from the country, still like the races. So
do professional people like doctors and
lawyers. Politicians are regulars, partly
because they do not have to pay, partly
because it is a fine place to meet people.
Although, Mr Cavenough says, you
rarely meet a scientist or an engineer at
Flemington. However, the bulk of the
racegoers are the semi-skilled workers
and laborers. “You see them in great
numbers on the special race trains, deeply
engrossed in their form guides, the only
literature they take seriously. Most of
them travel alone, believing a com-
panion interferes with the vital business
of selecting the right horses to back.
They dress very casually, often in short
sleeves and slacks, but even with sports
clothes they always wear a hat.”
Stopping The Rot
are several plans for stopping the
“■■rot in attendances. For the second
time the VRC is running its Cup Week
Festival of Fashions, Flowers and
Favorites. It bumped up attendances last
year. There •'are boxes of flowers in
Collins Street all the way from Elizabeth
to Spring Streets. The business houses
are taking part in a competition for the
most gorgeous floral decorations, outside
and inside. The winners get a sash and
a miniature gold Melbourne Cup.
The commercial banks are the keenest
competitors and in Collins Street they
fight out the prestige battle pelargonium
for pelnargonium and pansy for pansy.
The VRC knows damned well that more
money is made out of what goes on the
backs of women than on the backs of
horses, so the fashion industry is
involved in this in a big way. So now
we are in the midst of our Fashions in
the Field contest and the prizes include
three Ford cars and Qantas holidays in
New York and New Zealand. There are
five sections for the contest. Section 1
and Section 2, for example, are for
ensembles that cost no more than £4O
and under, and £BO and under.
The ladies have only to parade out
at Flemington mercifully not in the
Members’ Reserve, thank you and the
judges pick them out. Then the ladies
sign an affidavit, giving the total cost of
their ensembles. You may think that
the VRC is being utterly fearless in
labelling ladies in £4O, £BO and open
categories, but our Flinders Lane experts
are mighty expert. They can pick the
price of any women’s ensemble to the
nearest penny.
All this is very useful but the great
chestnut hope is the Totalisator Agency
Board, the off-course Tote. There are
now 95 TAB agencies in the metro-
politan area and 53 in the country. As
one Sydney journalist put it: “They are
as familiar in Melbourne as the footy
and as respectable as Rippon Lea.”
They’re everywhere, as handy as the local
branch of your bank.
Racing administrators claim that TAB
is not draining the grandstands. There
are cunning safeguards on credit to the
telephone bettor and neat devices like
this. Bets must be placed with the TAB
at least 40 minutes before the start of
each race. Do you get the point? This


period is delicately calculated to ensure
that the bettor does not learn the result
of one race, and so the standing of his
exchequer before betting on the next.
For the real enthusiast it is still a good
idea to go to the course.
If, indeed, TAB has had anything to
do with the drop in attendances, the
clubs can only drool at the prospect of
the riches in store. The first year the
turnover was £ll4 million, the next year
£264 million, next season it could be £4O
million and by 1967 it is expected to
reach a maximum of £7O million.
This time the share to the Victorian
clubs was £846,109 and the VRC’s cut
was £143,298. You can see what they
are trying to do. With the extra cash
from TAB they can bump up the stakes
and attract better horses, and there’s no
question it is the big name horses that
attract the crowds.
The VRC makes no secret of the fact
that it is out to secure Victoria’s position
for ever as top racing State. It is the
VRC centenary next March and it has
boosted the stakes for the autumn
carnival to £84,750, a whopping increase
of £21,200, all due to the TAB.
The AJC, you will note, retaliated by
raising its autumn 1964 prize money by
£27,000 to £IOO,OOO. The VRC’s Sir
Chester Manifold snorted: “They are liv-
ing on promised hopes.”
Do you get the picture? While NSW
sits on its hands over off-course betting
Victoria establishes a clear lead. Just the
other day the VRC released a figure on
this. It calculated all the country and
metropolitan races and worked out that
the average prize money per race was
£324/10. In NSW it was only £172.
The VRC is an ambitious club. It is
also a complete autocracy. It runs racing
in Victoria and runs it damned well.
There are some things we do not handle
efficiently in Australia, but we are second
to nobody in our skill at handling a race
meeting. One reason that has been put
forward for the honesty and efficiency
of our racing is that it is handled by
rich men, very rich men.
Sandown Park—a nasty threat
past chairman of the VRC and
-*■ chairman of the TAB is Sir Chester
Manifold. The Manifolds are blue chip
Victorian aristocracy. They have been
here since 1836. The present chairman
is Ross Grey Smith. He is a solicitor and
the Grey Smiths are fine in their own
right. His grandfather, Frank Grey
Smith, was one of the most famous of
the Melbourne Cricket Club presidents,
when the MCC ran all cricket in Aus-
tralia, and no nonsense.
Then there are other committeemen
like Fred Gilder, who has huge property
interests both in the city and the country,
Rupert Steele, who has big retail furni-
ture interests and Eugene Gorman,
maybe Australia’s leading jurist.
But wait, there’s a nasty looking cloud
overhead . . . Sandown Park. Once upon
a time there were eight racecourses
in Melbourne Flemington, Caulfield,
Moonee Valley, Williamstown, Sandown
Park and pony courses at Fitzroy and
Richmond. The last four closed down in
1931.
Williamstown closed down after the
grandstand was destroyed by fire. In 1948
the Williamstown Racing Club and the
Victorian Trotting and Racing Associa-
tion combined to form the Melbourne
Racing Club. The MRC had plenty of
members but no track of its own. Its
meetings were spread around the other
tracks.
Everybody hereabouts knows what
happened. The Melbourne Racing Club
started to pour money into the old San-
down Park course, conveniently, for
punters, opposite the Springvale Crema-
torium. These past 18 months it has been
open for car racing, but the big opening
for the horses will be August next year
after an expenditure of nigh on
£2,500,000.
It will be a beauty with such comforts
for the drinkers as closed circuit TV so
that they won’t have to walk outside to
look at the horses.
However, the bombshell arrived last
March—the merger between the Mel-
bourne Racing Club and the Victoria
Amateur Turf Club, which controls the
Caulfield track. The VATC voted 807
for 721 against, a majority of 86 votes
for the merger. The new club has the
old title VATC.
The VRC didn’t like the merger and
it has always been against the re-build-
ing of Sandown Park. It claimed that
Flemington, Caulfield and Moonee
Valley tracks were sufficient to handle
the Melbourne racing. All this was money
going down the drain that racing could
ill-afford.
Look what happens now. The com-
bined VATC gets 29 race days, Fleming-
ton gets 17 and Moonee Valley 14. The
TAB situation is even more interesting.
In the latest carve up the VATC gets
£218,007 and the VRC gets £143,298.
How this will affect the VRC in the
future could be downright interesting.
The stakes for the Caulfield Cup are
now £20,000 compared with £25,000 for
the Melbourne Cup. Already the VATC,
on one occasion, has threatened to put
Caulfield Cup stakes above those of the
Melbourne Cup. To us old race-goers,
the very thought of the Caulfield Cup
carrying the big-money is all too horrible;
as bad as playing the soccer final on the
MCG.
“With every quid we’ve got”
Vet the Melbourne Cup will always
A have the edge in tradition. The first
Caulfield Cup was in 1879. In those
days the VATC was fair dinkum amateur
and the Cup was for gentlemen riders
who rode upright in the raddle.
The first Melbourne Cup, of course,
was in 1861, watched by 1500 people.
Archer, the Sydney horse, won the race
most comfortably. But early in the piece
the local pressmen were far from im-
pressed with him. Centaur wrote: “It is
truly a work of labor and trepidation to
attempt the naming of the most likely
animal to show in front in this event”
and he went on to pick Mormon,
Dispatch and Tory Boy. Archer wasn't
in it.
Archer won again in 1862 carrying
the mighty weight of 10.2. So he
became one of only two horses to win
two Cups (Peter Pan was the other); and
one of only three to win a Cup with 10.0
or better. Etienne De Mestre trained him
secretly in what was known then as St
Kilda Park opposite the Botanical Hotel
in Domain Road. The Botanical is still
there—vastly improved since 1861 we
must add —and Archer's stable also is
still there, out the back. We hope it will
be preserved for ever as a shrine.
In those days horses inevitably came
from Sydney by boat, but Archer was
different. With his strapper, Dave Power,
he set out from Nowra on the NSW
south coast and WALKED more than
550 miles of winding bullock track to
Melbourne. He averaged about 26 miles
a day through the bush, starting out
from a small, prosperous sheep station
called Braidwood. The story goes that
both Power and Archer looked rather
scraggy when they arrived in town, that
October of 1861.
An unusual preparation, but one we
feel that Percy Cerutty would approve of
highly. So if we can discover that any
Sydney horse this year has walked the
the entire distance along the Hume High-
way, we'll back him with every quid we
can muster.

PROBLEMS!
The world of paper can be No Man’s Land to travellers
without a map! It’s so easy to make mistakes that mean
money wasted. Consider envelopes, now! Important things,
envelopes. For certain jobs, certain grades. Sometimes
only luxury paper is good enough. But often costs can
be cut. All you need to become “paper-proficient” is a
little expert information. Throughout Australia there are
Shoalhaven Advisory Centres, staffed by friendly
people who are ready, willing and able to put you in the
picture about paper. So there’s no need for anyone to get
enveloped in paper problems, large or small. Just call
your Shoalhaven Advisory Centre. We’ll gladly advise ...
and supply samples of Shoalhaven papers and boards.
Because paper-hungry Australia is using more and more
Shoalhaven products, a £7 million expansion project is
under way at the Wiggins Teape Shoalhaven Mill. Pro-
duction is being stepped up dramatically. Many additional
grades are being manufactured, including specialised
industrial papers not previously produced in this country.
Shoalhaven will have more —much more—to offer Aus-

PROFILE
Alec Douglas-Home
A determined , brave , ungraceful batsman
A Scottish Earl, who looks like an
important senior faun, has at last
“evolved” as the new Conservative
Prime Minister.
One of the most dramatic leadership
battles in the party’s history, bitterly
contested by ambitious men, has ended
with a calmly unambitious man in the
seat of power. Alexander Frederick
Douglas-Home, the Fourteenth Earl of
Home (who renounced his four titles to
become Sir Alexander Douglas-Home),
has shown himself to be without vanity
by willingly taking on a job popularly
supposed to have become his because
the other candidates have dished each
o th er _
But it would be wrong to suppose
that Home has played a passive or in-
different role. He may not be an aggres-
sive character. But he evidently is a
strong one, firmly based on real inde-
pendence, courage and a great deal of
self-control. He is a genuinely modest
man who yet could find the nerve to act
resolutely throughout this turbulent week.
In the process, he has visibly put on
authority.
Even his face has changed. It lost that
mildness which in the recent past has
often made him seem aloof perhaps
the proper posture for a Foreign Sec-
retary.
His is a striking and unusual face
a triangle standing on its point. It is
fine-boned and markedly without surplus
flesh. His mouth is wide and thin-lipped,
often tilting upwards to the left in an
eloquent, faintly ironic, smile. His hair
i s on f°P was auburn when he
was young), but thick enough back and
sides to allow him a minor version of
the Westminster cut. When reading a
speech he wears light and curiously an-
tique spectacles and tips his head from
side to side in a schoolmasterly way
H' s figure is slight and he has a deceptive
a ‘ r frailty.
Home indeed has little pretension.
Even in London he dresses without much
obvious interest in the result. As Foreign
Secretary he went about without retinue
ar| d sometimes walked to the Foreign
Office by way of the Embankment, with
no hat and with his hands in his pockets,
In his office, he commands great
loyalty. He is punctiliously polite, re-
members people’s names and jobs, chats
with liftmen and never stands on dignity.
He can be astonishingly vague he
can lose his car, his documents, even a
despatch box. He is not, in fact, very
good at looking after himself, and in
this w^e crucial,
He is good and ingenious at drafting
diplomatic Notes he has just that
touch of ambiguity which is so useful.
He has a somewhat undergraduate sense
of humor; he giggles easily, and enjoys
verbal, quasi-literary jokes. He even
keeps a joke book divided into dif-
ferent categories Scottish kirk jokes
for speeches, broader jokes for men’s
clubs, etc.
The Homes (pronounced, as all the
world has learned with proper reverence,
Humes) were once great lords of the
Border virtually petty kings in their
district. The society into which Alexander
was born in July, 1903 he was given
the name most often allotted to the
heads of his house was still an affluent
and buoyant one. Even today, earls are
relatively common along the Border.
But Alec was allowed to grow up in
surroundings less grand than some of
those available to his family. The Home
estates are broad, though not outsize.
They are divided into the segments in-
dicated by the hyphenated family name
the Douglas part and the Home part.
The two were formally joined in 1857
when the eleventh earl married Lady
Douglas of Douglas.
The Douglas part is by far the larger
53,000 acres of hill farms and 35,000
acres of grouse moor in Lanarkshire, be-
low Glasgow. Here there are 56 large
farms looked after by Mr Robert Mar-
shall Hamilton, Sir Alec’s factor. They
raise black-faced ewes, Highland cattle
and a small pedigree herd of Galloways.
There are also 3000 acres of forest,
cared for by 30 foresters, and nine game-
keepers.
On this western estate stands Castle-
mains, not to mention Castle Douglas,
the old Douglas seat (they were earls
before the Homes), now in the middle
of being pulled down. Castlemains is a
50-room shooting lodge a plain grey
house overlooking the main road from
Glasgow to Carlisle.
On the Home side of this double-
inheritance, covering the extreme eastern
end of the Border along the Tweed, there
are 5000 acres of farmland and a one-
and-a-half-mile stretch of the river. Here,
in Berwickshire, is the family seat, called
The Hirsel (telephone: Coldstream 1) and
full of treasures. It is an elegant eight-
eenth-century pile with several hundred
rooms and is up a long drive.
But as a boy Alexander lived in the
dower house, Springhill, because his
father had not at that time succeeded to
the earldom. No estate agent would call
Springhill modest. It is a big place,
covered in red creeper, looking out over
the Tweed, the battlefield of Flodden and
the beginnings of England.
Alec’s father the thirteenth earl,
and so inevitably known as the Unlucky
Earl appeared as a very simple man;
amiable, kindly, really loved by most of


his tenants. In the depressed ’twenties he
used to take venison and sheep down
to the soup kitchens in Douglas, then
a mining village, and called many of
the local miners by their Christian names.
Anyone he met and liked he would
invite to stay: there were huge meals,
lots of guests, immense shooting parties,
and the wine always ran out at dinner.
If the hock ran out you were given
whatever was at hand, which might be
port so that half would be drinking
hock and half port. You had to play
round games after dinner.
He took some mild interest in politics
stood for Parliament in 1910 and
later worked for the League of Nations.
But basically he was a country gentle-
man, president of the Boys’ Brigade for
years. He was portrayed as the eccentric
earl by William Douglas-Home, Lord
Home’s playwright brother, in “The Chil-
tern Hundreds.”
The play presents the father as an
endearing, slightly bumbling, but also
forthright character, at a loss about mod-
em life and inclined to discuss it faceti-
ously. Nobody could suppose this to be
a portrait in the round, but it has, within
its limits, what members of the family
reckon is the truth. Indeed, some of the
recorded attributes are noticeably repro-
duced in his sons strongly in the
playwright and to some extent in the
fourteenth earl the amused detach-
ment particularly.
Streak of Radicalism
A lec’s mother was a Lambton from
across the Border—one of the family
of the Earl of Durham. Home takes
pride in his Lambton blood, naming
it as the source of his political sense.
He likes to recall that he is descended
from the Lord Durham who wrote the
famous Report on Canadian Indepen-
dence in 1839. Besides, his paternal
grandmother was a daughter of Grey
of the Reform Bill.
Alec’s mother was the lively and more
outspoken half of the marriage. She is
still alive —in her eighties. When her
children were young she was more in
touch with contemporary affairs than
her husband cared to be, and showed
some streaks of radicalism in her
opinions.
He had an enviable boyhood, learning
to shoot and fish in splendid natural
surroundings, among people who liked
his family. From this he went away
to a prep, school in Hertfordshire and
then to Eton, and everyone knows how
well he did there. The other night a
schoolfellow, Mr Cyril Connolly, who
is not a hero-worshipper, spoke on tele-
vision with real admiration of Home in
his Eton phase.
Home was President of Pop, the club
through which, as monitors, the senior
boys do their share in the government
of the school. He was “a patrician but
a very tolerant one.”
The slice of ripe Connolly prose de-
scribing Home at Eton is already
famous:—
“He was a votary of the esoteric Eton
religion, the kind of graceful, tolerant,
sleepy boy who is showered with favors
and crowned with all the laurels, who
is liked by the masters and admired by
the boys without any apparent exertion
on his part, without experiencing the
ill-effects of success himself or arousing
the pangs of envy in others. In the eight-
eenth century he would have become
Prime Minister before he was 30; as
it was he appeared honorably ineligible
for the struggle of life.”
Not all Home’s fellow-Etonians took
so romantic a view. Another contempor-
ary recalls him for his slightly rabbity
appearance, and his contorted bowling
action.
For a few years cricket was an import-
ant part of his life. He played a few
matches for Middlesex in the 19205, and
toured South America for MCC in
1926-27. He was a useful medium-pace
bowler despite his ugly run up: a good
slip field, and a determined and brave,
if ungraceful, batsman. Of his 66 against
Harrow in 1922, on a bad wicket, it
was said he made 65 of them off his
thumb. He was always in line, and didn’t
flinch even though he was hit.
At Oxford he didn’t get a blue, and
he did get a third. When he went down
no one thought they would ever hear
of him again. Nor did there seem any
reason to change that opinion when
Home decided to go into politics.
From 1931 to 1937 he was a loyal
and comparatively uncommunicative
back-bencher, concerned about unem-
ployment in his own Lanark constitu-
ency; but he did not follow his col-
league Harold Macmillan in rebelling
against his party for permitting it. He
was concerned, too, about the rise of
Hitler, but far from rebelling against
Chamberlain’s policies, like Anthony
Eden and Salisbury, he served from
1937 to 1939 as Chamberlain’s Parlia-
mentary Private Secretary.
Once he went with Chamberlain to a
conference with Mussolini, where his
job was to stick with his master and
never leave him alone with Musso. The
story is told of how, when the two lead-
ers got into a small lift in a hotel, there
was no room for Home: he had to rac©
up the stairs, meeting the lift at every
level, and seeing Musso’s bald pate, with
a large boil on top, appearing at eacfi
floor. He met them, panting at the toff*
He was close to Chamberlain, but
suspected that he would make a fool of
himself when he returned from Munich:
he was horrified at the “peace with
honor” statement.
But he still publicly defends his old
chief’s policies. He still argues that until
it became clear that Hitler could not be
appeased and was in fact bent on waf,
Chamberlain did right to try to reach
agreement with him.
While still active as Chamberlain’s
aide, Home’s health gave way and he
spent from 1939 to 1941 on his back
with TB. (His brother William thinks the
contorted bowling action was the origin
of the trouble.) He read prodigiously, his
main purpose being to educate himself
in Soviet affairs. He developed the view
that the Russians were ultimately the
real threat, and he was concerned lest the
war with Hitler should divert Britain’s
attention from this fundamental truth.
In 1944, at the time of the Yalta
conference, when good-will towards our
ally and trust in her post-war attentions
was at its zenith, he made a speech in
the House of Commons warning Church-
ill and Eden that the Russians could
not be trusted. His analysis of Russian
motives and his forecast of Russia’s
post-war behavior borne out by events
amounted to a major attack on
Government policy.
He was among those who lost their
seats in the general election of the fol-
lowing year. He came back into the
House of Commons in 1950 but the next
year his father died when he was actually
in the House, so that he was at once
stopped from going into the Chamber.
By this time his views about the Russians
had become more fashionable. The fall
of Czechoslovakia, the Berlin blockade
and the outbreak of the Korean war had
changed the atmosphere. But for the next
four years he devoted himself largely to
domestic affairs.
When the former Chief Whip, James
Stuart, became Secretary of State for
Scotland in 1951, he asked Churchill to
let him have Home as his Minister of
State. Churchill, whom Home said had
scarcely heard of him, agreed. Stuart —-
now Lord Stuart of Findhorn who
always moved at a steady pace, relied
greatly on Home’s energy, loyalty and
readiness to serve. These qualities be-
came known, and in 1955 Eden had
Home transferred to the Commonwealth
Relations Office. Home was still very
little known in the party, and it now
seems astonishing practically un-
known to the public, outside Scotland.


When he went to the Commonwealth
Relations Office, he had for the first time
to deal with a world beyond Europe.
Although he tried hard to understand
Africans, Asians and Arabs he has never
succeeded in making the imaginative
jump needed to understand their slightly
aggrieved approach to life. He can ap-
preciate their rational attitudes, such as
their desire for non-alignment, their an-
tipathy to racial discrimination and their
ambition to fight their poverty; but he
has never disguised his dislike of their
emotionalism and the methods that it
produces.
A Double Standard
A fter he had left the CRO, his feelings
were made clear in a speech at Ber-
wick-on-Tweed in which he warned that
the United Nations should not become
the vehicle by which the Afro-Asians
practised “a double standard of morality.”
Some considered the speech candid,
others tactless. The Afro-Asians thought
it offensive.
His political instincts on the Afro-
Asian world have always been close to
those of the Right-wing of the Tory
Party. So long as he was at the CRO,
Lord Salisbury and his followers were
content. Salisbury’s resignation, signifi-
cantly, came soon after Home left the
CRO in 1960.
There is only one cause he made his
own while Commonwealth Minister: sup-
port of Sir Roy Welensky’s Central Afri-
can Federation. His devotion caused a
former Governor of Northern Rhodesia
to dub him “Sir Roy’s postboy.” Welen-
sky seldom appealed in vain to him for
help against the Colonial Secretary of
the day first lain Macleod and later
Reginald Maudling two of Lord
Home’s present doubters.
It was largely due to his interventions
in the Cabinet that British policy lagged
in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland.
In the end, Home lost faith in Welensky;
but by then he was already at the Foreign
Office, and the Central African Federa-
tion was visibly crumbling. Welensky
praised him again last week as Sir Win-
ston’s true heir.
Both at the CRO and later at the
Foreign Office, Home has identified him-
self with his party’s Right-wing on three
crucial questions concerning Britain’s re-
lations with the Afro-Asians. He has
firmly resisted applying public pressure
on Dr Verwoerd’s Government, and was
against South Africa’s exclusion from the
Commonwealth. Although he does not
endorse Portuguese policy in Angola, he
has opposed all suggestions to apply
pressure on the Salazar regime. On the
Katanga issue his policies took Britain
into open conflict with the UN Assembly
and led to a sharp division with the
United States.
In the Middle East he has continued
to act upon ideas which were being
officially questioned before Eden became
Premier, notably the idea that a British
military presence is essential to ensure
British access to Persian Gulf oil; and to
insist on our need of military bases in
the Mediterranean and in Aden and
“reliable” air routes through Africa to
be used in the event of Middle East
troubles.
In 1956-57 Home acted as Deputy
Leader of his party in the Lords, and
then, until 1960, as Leader. This was
a very important, perhaps the crucial,
step in his career. As spokesman for
the Government in the Lords he re-
vealed his capacities. As Lord President
of the Council he was able simultan-
eously to make his mark in the Cabinet.
Home became Foreign Secretary in
July, 1960. The appointment was greeted
with a storm of indignation in the Press
(including “The Observer”) and in the
House of Commons. But in the Lords
the Labor peers were well aware of his
abilities in debating and diplomacy.
As Foreign Secretary for the last three
years, Home has shown no Gaullist-type
jealousy of the Americans and has got on
well with them, even when there have
been conflicts between British and
American interest. He has not adopted
an extreme attitude towards tfye Com-
munists over reaching a Berlin settle-
ment or an activist attitude over Cuba,
and it is possible that his candour and
tough-mindedness have been positive
assets in achieving better Soviet-American
relations.
On Macmillan’s decision to apply for
Britain’s entry to the Common Market,
Home was loyal rather than enthusiastic.
By prior agreement, he scrupulously left
the negotiations and public speaking to
Heath and never demonstrated the prose-
lytising zeal of, for instance, Sandys or
Soames. But he firmly supported the idea
that Britain should not be squeezed out
of a prospective partnership between a
united Europe and the United States. It
was the same anxiety to keep Britain
in the main stream of the partnership
which led him to insist almost alone
inside the Cabinet last month that Bri-
tain must participate in the official talks
on the possibility of a mixed-crew nu-
clear force.
In public, he has always taken the
Gaullist-type view on the independent
British nuclear deterrent as an essential
part of sovereign power, arguing recently
that but for Britain’s bomb we could
not have played any part in the test
ban negotiations. In private, however,
his dedication to the independent British
deterrent may be less than absolute.
Firm in his attitude that Communists
will expand whenever opportunity pre-
sents itself, he believes that the change
for the better in Russian temper and
attitudes is due to the rise of the new,
scientifically - minded, non - doctrinaire
classes, and that it makes permanent co-
existence possible, indeed predictable.
He shows a similar open-mindedness
in domestic affairs. On capital punish-
ment, for instance: he supports it only
because he thinks the balance of evi-
dence does not yet justify its abolition.
He accepts the concept of a mixed econ-
omy and has said that the State should,
if necessary, take central powers to deal
with unemployment, economic expansion
and population drifts.
At such a moment it is inevitable that
the Left should condemn the choice of
Home because of his ancient lineage.
The “Daily Worker,” mincing no words,
says it has “put feudalism at the helm.”
A determined Herald is said lately to
have traced the Home line back to Mac-
beth. When the great power of the
Douglas family in the Scottish Borders
was at last’ shattered by James II of
Scotland, three families scrambled for
the pickings: the Scotts, the Kerrs and
the Homes. The head of the Scotts is
now the Duke of Buccleuch; the Kerrs
provide both Lord Lothian and the Duke
of Roxburghe.
Home’s domestic background is con-
tented. Lady Home, the daughter of
Home’s headmaster at Eton, Dr Aling-
ton, has no aspirations for smart society,
wears homely clothes, and likes books
and crosswords. Her mother, a Lyttel-
ton, voted Socialist, and Lady Home has
inherited her mother’s social conscience.
The Homes tend to spend shooting
holidays at Castlemains, which is shabby
and comfortable and has a peeling brown
front door. Inside are family oil-paint-
ings, cosy sitting-rooms, a baronial-type
kitchen and a big gong. There are 14
bedrooms, plus eight for the staff. Life
in the Home family runs to long walks
and parties of mixed ages, while Home
himself wanders about arranging the
flowers, working with his feet up on a
sofa, and endlessly looking for his spec-
tacles.
At Castlemains he and his wife enter-
tain a good deal. This year they had the
Japanese Ambassador, and Mr Mac-
millan and Lady Dorothy for the second
year running the Homes give up
their own brass bed to the Macmillans.

Battleplan: Capture Today
About the time you see your morning
paper we are busy planning its destruction.
For nothing is more perishable than news.
Nothing more urgent, exciting, or demanding,
either.
At six-thirty every morning we hold our
news conference to plot the course of the news
of today.
It is like trying to plan the weather. You
never can, really.
We try.
We ask ourselves what news is breaking
today. We prepare for what might happen. We
arrange our news-gathering forces accord-
ingly.
Editor. News Editor. Sporting editor.
Feature editor. Each has a responsibility.
Be factual. Be aware. Be apt. Write tight.
These are our field forces. Our battleplan
is clear. Today is the objective.
To capture it, we mobilise seven separate
editions. Change story after story, attempting
to perfect our attack. Trying to be first,
factual, aware, apt, tight.
Sometimes we make it. Deliver the very
best of the today we discovered—in time for
you to buy it.
Mostly, we almost capture today. That’s
the exciting part. The challenge.
No newspaper anywhere has ever printed
a perfect paper. We want to be the first.
The Daily Mirror.

SPORT
Why are Long Tours so Long?
After all , there are jets from Jamaica to here ...
By DISCUS
Summer is here in sport if not always
in cold fact. The South African
cricket team is in Perth, the Demons
(the Melbourne VFL team) are abroad
now for their annual reward in the sun,
the Davis Cup is only a few weeks away,
yacht crews ,are preparing for the
annual Sydney to Hobart run, and
everywhere is that edginess which
precedes the contest. Even the sea-
gulls with affinity for the cool
green of cricket grounds are due for
their big season, because Charles Fortune
is here. (“A beautiful stroke by Barry
Shepherd and it scatters the seagulls.
They’re rising straight up and wheeling
around the Members’ Stand, and I don’t
wonder at their fright, because that ball
. . . oh, what happened here ... I believe
Shepherd is out.”)
South African cricket commentator
Charles Fortune arrived in Perth ahead
of the team a couple of weeks ago, and
was asked to bat on about color bars and
South Africa’s future in cricket without
matches against India, Pakistan and the
West Indies. He replied that cricket and
politics should not be coupled on this
tour, and in Brisbane that weekend Ray
Lindwall said much the same on a tele-
vision programme. This only makes sense.
No one pounces on the South African
golfers, race drivers or visiting business
men to ask them loaded questions. We
could all help the game by sticking to
cricket.
There’s plenty to wonder about in that.
Will Gordon Rorke make the Australian
team? If he plays against South Africa
with no complaints about his delivery,
will the English cricket-writers be satis-
fied? Who will be our openers? Will
Bobby Simpson vice-captain the Com-
bined XI at Perth, in Barry Shepherd’s
territory or the Australian XI on Bill
Lawry’s ground in Melbourne both
pointers to captaincy for the England
tour? Will the South Africans be the
fielders they were ten years ago? Or any
good at all? Will they play cricket likely
to sharpen our men for a season of
“bright cricket” in England, where we’ll
be going in after the West Indies, or will
they play dull cricket and dull us?
So who cares whether the South Afri-
can cricket players agree or disagree with
Dr Verwoerd or, quite possibly,
among themselves. Australia has a new
team to shape, and the cricket this sum-
mer will affect it. It isn’t politics that
matters, but cricket politics, what Lind-
wall’s “Board of Control members . . .
old ... a little out of touch with the
game”, will do on the basis of this sum-
mer’s experiences.
They might do as Ray Lindwall sug-
gests, bring a West Indies team here for
a short visit in 1965, before our team
goes away. There are such things as jet
airliners. The profits of one good match
in Sydney or Melbourne would pay for
a short visit, any summer, by any lively
international team. If Rugby League can
stage a world series, why are short visits
impossible for the Board of Control to
imagine, for our benefit and the weaker
cricket countries?
Why do long tours have to be so long?
The South Africans are here for 5 months
and 28 matches, one match more than
England played here. Why not half the
season for one international team and
half for another? With a three-way con-
test at the meeting point? These notions
may be laughable to those who prefer to
look backward, but cricket will have to
smarten up to survive. The day may be
nearer than we think, when the answer
to “Who will captain Australia?” could
be a resounding “Who cares?”
★ ★ ★
That day arrived some time ago in
athletics, which still shows few signs of
calling in the doctors to stop a bad case
of hardened cerebral arteries. In Sydney
recently 7500 people watched the Great
Public Schools, sports. Amateur athletics
often has trouble drawing 500. The GPS
sports had partisan supporters. Amateur
athletics hasn’t a clue how to achieve
that. At a seminar in Sydney someone
thought it might be an idea to ask Rotary,
Apex and Lions clubs to sponsor athletic
clubs in the country areas. And someone
else wanted the current champions to
suggest how athletics might be made
more attractive to competitors as well as
spectators, and the italics are mine.
The competitors’ side of the question
can be answered in two words. BIG
DEAL. I’ve been to meets where, at the
end of a race, some fellow mumbles over
the loud speakers, “First, Miss B. Cuth-
bert, second . etc. And somewhere
down there on the field one of Australia’s
great women athletes sits in the melee,
anonymous, tying her shoelace or chew-
ing an orange and perhaps remembering
bands, applause, spotlights, a dais where
the winners were visible and honored.
Amateur athletics gives winning a
State title, or any title from club up, less
jazz than success in an egg and spoon
race at a Sunday School picnic. Could
this be the old official keeping the usually
young competitor in his or her “place”,
or is it plain stupidity? The athlete who
goes to the top works and trains for it to
an extent which most unpaid officials
would regard as just too much to con-
sider. This year in NSW we had the
spectacle of everyone considering it too
much, no one wanting to be president
and secretary of the State Amateur
Athletic Association, and the jobs going
to two men with no direct interest in
athletics, but some sense of duty, some
business know-how, and some obvious
energy.
Athletics, like many other sports rap-
idly keeling over in the contest with new
occupations for the young, needs a com-
plete reorganisation, and reorientation.
The athlete, man or woman, needs to be
reinstated as hero, needs to be delibe-
rately publicised for sport’s good, needs
to be given a value as well as an ethic of
unpaid sweat and tears, needs something
in the urn to stop that hollow ring.
Otherwise the potential athletes will go
where the crowd roars, into the paid
sports, into the honored order of guitar
twangers, onto the surf boards, into the
hot rods and racing cars. The trend is to
sports in which nerve and reflex are more
important than educated muscle, and
maybe nothing can prevent it, or should.
Certainly, nothing that the weary organ-
isers of the dying sports are doing will
be enough to dent this trend.
What can athletics do? Join ’em, since

The entertainment which keeps you company on the beach,
or at the sportsground, travels afar to help break the mono-
tony and the loneliness of Australia’s outback.
Many a man on the track carries with him the cheer of
music and the knowledge of news, thanks to compact radios
which pack away into a swag, or tuck into a pocket.
Go-anywhere radios are powered by EVEREADY batteries far
smaller and lighter than the radio batteries of a few years
ago. Australian research by UNION CARBIDE has helped the
radio battery to slim down to a mere fraction of its former
size and weight. Today, no country makes a battery better.
The familiar EVEREADY battery is but one of many UNION
CARBIDE products. Chemicals, plastics, and industrial pro-
ducts supplied by UNION CARBIDE are aids to the develop-
ment of many industries.

The Homes only recently began to
use The Hirsel, the official seat of the
earldom. Lady Home is renovating it,
introducing a lot of open plan by abolish-
ing the separate existence of 22 rooms
and the chapel and has just installed a
lift. But most of the time Lady Caroline,
the Homes’ eldest daughter, has the
place to herself. She divides her time
between being assistant factor for the
estate and serving the Queen Mother as
a part-time lady-in-waiting.
It is still the custom on the Border not
to send daughters to school. Sir Alec’s
three had governesses and finishing
schools. His second daughter, Lady
Meriel, is a gay blonde who studied art
and once worked in Bumpus, the London
bookshop. The other, Lady Diana, re-
cently married a businessman. Lord Dun-
glass, the only son, a magnificent shot, is
20, and has just been sent down from
Oxford for failing his exams (Home’s
father was sent down, too).
On Sundays at Douglas, the Homes
attend the Scottish Episcopal chapel.
Home is not quite so religious as his
father was, but he is a genuine church-
man.
There are evident streaks of originality,
if not of wildness, in the brothers. Wil-
liam, the playwright, had marked pacifist
tendencies. Even so, he enlisted during
the war and was serving with a flame-
throwing regiment when it found itself
before Le Havre.
William was reluctant to see the town
attacked, because he believed there
were many civilians inside it and that
the German commander was likely to
surrender, anyway. When it seemed
improbable that this point of view was
going to prevail, he took matters into
his own hands. He tied a pair of white
Army-issue drawers to the aerial of his
jeep and set out to persuade the Ger-
mans to capitulate. But he was stopped
on the way, in due course court-
martialled and sent to Wormwood
Scrubs.
An officer who was with William at
the time is satisfied that his motives
were entirely honorable, even if his
actions were excessively independent.
When Alec visited him in the Scrubs,
as soon as he set eyes on William in
those woeful surroundings he burst out
laughing.
Brother Henry is an ornithologist,
living in a ramshackle farmhouse nine
miles from The Hirsel. He has a small
herd of donkeys and 80 birds, mostly
tropical, which he keeps in an aviary
outside the front door and in rows of
cages in the sitting-room. He is an
eminent Bird Man on radio and TV
(also appearing on Border TV as part
of the McEwen folk-singing act).
Up on the Border these last few weeks
the local people have perhaps naturally
been inclined to speak of their Earl in
glowing terms. But the fact is the locals
do not know him as well as they knew
his father. They say he is “hard on
poachers.”
But in the true Home country, at least,
people see it as a grave thing that Sir
Alec was parted from his ancient Scottish
title. “It’s no matter for Lord Hailsham,”
they say, “he’s only second generation.
But Lord Home is really it” (ofns.)
it can’t lick ’em. I won’t elaborate on that,
and be responsible for any official’s heart
failure.

Here’s praise where it’s due. Although
one of the fading sports in the Eastern
States is tennis, it’s flourishing in Perth
and in Adelaide, where the Challenge
Round will do no harm. Enthusiasm
gained Adelaide the Davis Cup matches,
enthusiasm and a promise to bring the
Memorial Drive courts and surrounds
up to a suitable standard without financial
help from the LTAA.
The cost of the work could have im-
poverished the South Australian LTA,
but since the Challenge Round was
awarded, the Association’s players and
committee members have spent their
weekends painting the stands, aisle steps,
and clubhouse. So the job has been done
for the cost of the paint and South Aus-
tralian tennis will be much richer for
it, in many ways.
I’m indebted to the “Adelaide Adver-
tiser” for that story, reported by Sylv
Phelan. In these times, such an example
is worth publicising far around. The re-
wards of amateur tennis in Adelaide are
largely of the spirit, and it is obvious that
good officials, willing to work and not
winge, can create a good spirit in sport.

It may be too late to suggest a way
out for Australian swimming’s conflict
with the Internationa] Olympic Council
over the pre-Games training camps at
Townsville. The lOC has ruled that three
weeks is the duration limit for such
camps, in any sport, and Australian offic-
ials feel this places our swimmers at a
disadvantage. They are out of training,
after winter, and the Northern Hemis-
phere nations are in training, after a
summer.
I’d suggest the whole issue could have
been resolved by opening the Townsville
six-weeks training camp to all Southern
Hemisphere nations. They are few
New Zealand, South Africa, Mauritius,
etc. and the South American nations
below the Equator.
We could have offered to pay the dif-
ference in fares for their swimmers’
deviation to Townsville. The cost would
not have been very large. Most Olym-
piads are in the Northern Hemisphere.
The lOC would have been placed in
the position of refusing all Southern
Hemisphere swimmers a chance to train
up to the northern swimmers’ standard —
if the lOC really did aim the rule at Aus-
tralia alone.
It’s almost a year to the Tokio Olym-
piad. It may not be too late to make this
counter proposal, if the lOC resists Aus-
tralia’s efforts to have the rule amended.

The best news I’ve struck about Soccer
in a long time apart from a 30,000
gate for a club final in Sydney is the
Victorian referees’ decision to take civil
action against any players who clobbered
them.
In most sections of most codes, the
referee merely refers the assault to the
code’s tribunal, which wags a finger at
the bad-tempered one, or fines him a
fiver. But, then, in few other codes are
the referees exposed to the kinds of
danger they meet in Soccer.
It’s one of several things the game can
well do without, and the Victorian refe-
rees have made a good decision for Soc-
cer.

Motor racing has a large following and
ample excitement. It involves a well-ad-
vertised product, the car in its various
makes. It is one of the few major inter-
national sports, with venues and followers
on every continent. And it receives less
publicity in Australia than boxing, which
it outdraws every time. The trouble seems
to be that it is not really accepted as a
sport. Even television, which has shown
signs of adopting it, treats it more as a
spectacle.
The difference between reporting the
performances of cars and those of horses
and athletes escapes me, but of all the
newspapers only the “Daily Telegraph” in
Sydney has anything like regular columns
about the sport. In Melbourne a few
weeks ago, when the VFL grand final
had most of Monday’s “Sun”, the Gold
Star meeting at Sandown Park, with 20
of our best drivers and an attendance of
17,500, was given roughly the same space
as the minor sports. And didn’t rate a
picture. It was followed on radio, by
3AW.
More recently, Bob Stilwell’s run at
Mullala, which clinched the drivers’
championship for him, only rated a
buried paragraph in most of the inter-
state newspapers and little or no mention
anywhere else. The next Gold Star meet
is at Warwick Farm in Sydney on Decem-
ber 1, and I’m willing to bet it outdraws
anything else that weekend, and gets one
quarter of the publicity.
It seems time the coming sport was
recognised as one and its followers cater-
ed for, to suit their number.


OUT AND ABOUT
A Gentleman’s Man of God
“Anglicans sing tenor”
By JAN SMITH
The Very Reverend William Bad-
deley, Anglican Dean of Brisbane,
is everything a Dean should be,
at any rate for those whose education
has included High Church worship and
early exposure to the Dean’s favorite
author, Anthony Trollope. Queenslanders
love him. Tall, dark-haired and ruddily
handsome, he wears a sweeping black
cassock at 10 in the morning, knows
his wine and horseflesh, loves the arts
and gets on famously with everyone.
He is open, optimistic and every inch
a gentleman’s Man of God, convinced
that no problem is insuperable and that
church union is not only desirable but
eminently possible. He, in turn, finds
good old Northern hospitality everything
Queenslanders say it is. The very day
after his arrival in Brisbane in 1958,
fresh from the London parish of St
Pancras, he went for a solitary ramble
downtown and was almost immediately
approached by a trammie, 15 years out
from Manchester, who'd recognised him
from a photograph in the newspaper.
The frequency of little incidents like
this are understandable with someone
like the Dean, whose imperturbable opti-
mism and jolliness have kept him beam-
ing brightly in the public eye ever since.
When rival clergy criticised his gambling
(and winning) at the races as “degrading”
and a cause of “dismay and embarrass-
ment,” the Dean came back with the
clincher that belief in God was a gamble
anyway, and that Christ, the greatest of
good mixers, would surely have visited
the race tracks of his day.
Asking the Dean about how he finds
time for work is a trap question
everything he does is work. He receives
debs at country centres like Kilcoy and
Mitchell (“great fun,” said Shirley Bad-
deley, remembering country hospitality
and long walks through wet grass in
bouffant evening dresses), preaches at
Anglican schools, opens rose shows, and
addresses Rotary Clubs at the rate of
one a week.
He has blessed island fishing fleets,
Surfer’s Chevron Island Bridge (leading
from Surfer’s proper to a flat, treeless
river-island behind the hotel) and this
month flew north with Mrs Baddeley on
their fourth Islands Festival trip to Hay-
man Island, where, as guests of Ansett,
they judged beauty quest entrants.
At last year’s Warana Festival the
Dean adjudicated a pipe-smoking con-
test, and in September addressed the
Catholic Readers and Writers’ Society
on the Spanish Mystics. But it’s all part
of the job where the Church’s call can
be furthered as much by a smile as by
a sermon.
When to this work is added the Dean’s
formidable television commitments, the
real wonder is that he finds any time
for private pursuits like improvising and
playing hardy classics on the Deanery
Steinway, and playing with his treasured
stereo equipment. Most of his recrea-
tions have become semi-official. He is
president of the Elizabethan Trust’s
Queensland Council; the Brisbane Reper-
tory Theatre, and the Queensland Ballet
Company.
Queensland’s Archbishop Strong, for
27 years Bishop of New Guinea, has been
away from a large part of his three
years’ incumbence, and, in true Trollope
fashion, is generally referred to as the
new Bishop. With the Bishop in England
and later in Canada for the Anglicans’
Toronto Conference, the Dean has found
himself increasingly cast as a focus and
mouthpiece for the diocese.
It is superfluous to ask the Dean if
he enjoys it because he obviously does.
He has a family background of theatre,
with sisters Hermione and Angela on
the stage; a fine bass voice and a natural
flair for cutting an imposing figure. For
nearly two years he has chaired a TV
discussion show on Channel 9, “Round
Table,” with Labor politician Senator
Condon Byrne and journalist Harry Sum-
mers making up the triumvirate. The
Prime Minister and Archbishop Strong
have made guest appearances, and the
usual topical problems have been thor-
oughly thrashed about, if not out.
Dean Baddeley finds boxing barbaric
and uncivilised, thinks there’d be less
drunkenness if women drank in bars with
their menfolk, urges brighter Sundays
and doesn’t think teenagers are any
worse than they used to be.
He broadcasts regularly for the ABC,
appears on the national “Any Ques-
tions?” show, and did 18 months in a
weekly television programme, “The
Home Show,” for women. On Thurs-
days he conducts a lunch-hour service in
the Cathedral, with women predominat-
ing. Two and a half years ago he met
the Queen in Rome, and legend has it he
made a last-minute dash across the city
on the back of a motor-scooter to keep
the date. He also had an audience with
the Pope.
Dean Baddeley is optimistic about
church unity, and believes it’s largely a
matter of churches getting together,
Round Table style, and undoing 20


centuries of bad publicity. With greater
understanding on a social level, he
thinks there’s more chance of a doctrinal
compromise. Recently he found himself
at an ecumenical get-together, singing in
his accustomed bass beside a Salvation
Army officer.
“At the end of the hymn the Salvation
Army chap turned to me and said, with
some surprise, that he’d always thought
Anglicans had to sing tenor,” he said.
“It’s just an example of the hundreds of
simple misunderstandings that have to
be sorted out.”
Nevertheless, church unity must
eventually be a problem of the song,
and not the singer, so how does the Dean
feel about thornier issues like divorce and
birth control, to name but two? Divorce
was no problem really (in the Church of
England, one just shouldn’t), and birth
control was simply a matter of agreeing
on means, because even the Catholics
recognised it in principle. There was no
really insuperable obstacles, he thought,
and whether it is his fault or not, the
impression came through that everything
will come out all right if only we all sit
tight and say our prayers.
For down-to-earth opinions on social
problems, Shirley Baddeley is possibly a
better bet. “You can’t tell me girls have
illegitimate babies because they don’t
know any better,” she said firmly over a
glass of sherry while the Dean dashed off
to the doctor. “It’s nearly always a
grudge against the parents, paying them
back for a real or imagined wrong up-
bringing.” She was upset over some local
dating customs, schoolgirl promiscuity,
and the recent case of the young un-
married nurse who threw her new-born
baby over a cliff and went back on duty.
A trim English rose with curly brown
hair, Shirley Baddeley is a keen gallery
and theatregoer, and is trying to learn
Malay. She adores Brisbane, where
she’s uncovered a nest of far-removed
cousins, and likes to accompany the
Dean on his outback travels. Shortly
after her arrival here she drove, with a
girlfriend, to Alice Springs from Bris-
bane. “He’s never forgiven me for
getting there first,” she said.
Things may be regrettably less than
perfect in the world, but for the Dean
this is no reason for doubting that God
is not in His heaven, and when German
theologians like Tillich, Bonhoeffer and
Bultmann try to rehabilitate God from
His astral penthouse, Dean Baddeley’s
geniality gives way to old-fashioned
clerical sternness. Asking people to call
him Bill is one thing—it doesn’t mean
they can take the same liberties with
God.
The Dean reviewed “Honest to God”
earlier this year for “The Sydney Morn-
ing Herald,” revealing himself as a dyed-
in-the-cloth traditionalist. The Bishop’s
attack on popular religious images
“incarnation . . . conjures up the idea of
a divine substance being plunged into
flesh and coated with it like chocolate or
silver plating”—seemed to the Dean an
"You know, J. B., this is a part of the rat race I like."
affront to millions of devout and sincere
Christians.
The absence of any reference to the
Holy Spirit, or the necessity for prayer,
also upset him to the point of concluding
that the Bishop would have been better
off sleeping on the problem and saying
his prayers in the meantime.
But for most people, finding a roof
for God’s head is the least of their
problems, and the Dean is far more
concerned with the threat posed by
Indonesia to the emergent Christian
communities of New Guinea and Papua
which he visited last year. Make no
mistake, said the Dean. Islam was on the
move, and must not be allowed to
jeopardise the new-found faith and
religious appreciation of the natives. “It’s
a very real thing to the Papuans,” he ex-
plained. “Not just a formalised ritual.
It’s an all-or-nothing thing, and my trip
there last year made a profound
impression on me.”
Deans must live in deaneries, and in
William Baddeley’s case it is impossible
to imagine him anywhere else. The
Deanery of the Cathedral of St John
the Evangelist is a two-storey stone house
of eminently English aspect, set on a
cliff over Adelaide Street and backing
on the Cathedral grounds. Inside it is
newly carpeted, hung with Shirley
Baddeley’s Boyds and Gleghorns, and
has funny staircases and split-level bath-
rooms. Queensland's first Governor lived
there in 1859.
St John’s Cathedral is a triumph of
14th century French Gothic architecture,
which explains why it is taking so long
to complete. You not only can’t get
the stone these days, but it is practically
impossible to get the stonemasons, at
any rate in Australia. Nation-wide
tenders have been called to complete the
Cathedral, and the offers, both around
the £1 million mark, are now being
investigated. Characteristically, the
Dean believes they can be reduced.
The foundations for the new section
now take up what used to be the
Cathedral’s front lawn, but the west
entrance is still through a small door in
the temporary wall which cuts hori-
zontally across the nave. It was designed
by John Pearson, who did Truro
Cathedral in the same Gothic style, and
features soaring stone pillars, a rose
window and a distant but impressive
altar. In a High Church state, it is not
the highest, but sufficiently ornate and
sensuous to fill Southern visitors with
evangelical misgivings.


Off the Face of the Earth
The long , unhappy history or Sinkiang
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Because of a misunderstanding about
arrangements, Mrs Frieda Blasch
waited in my office for an hour and
a half. She waited with the cheerful
tenacity of someone whose life has been
spent in patience. Mrs Blasch had been
suggested by someone as a possible story
because she lived for some years in Sin-
kiang. There had been time only for me
to have a quick look at the map to see
whether Sinkiang was anywhere near
where I thought it was. There was
also the feeling that her memories of the
place might be confined to the cheapness
of the domestic servants and the impos-
sibility of the drinking water, as travel-
lers’ tales from countries just as unhappy
as Sinkiang all too often tend to be.
Mrs Blasch’s own expectations were
small. She just wanted someone to write
something about Sinkiang so that “people
would remember that it is there”.
There is little in the newspapers to
remind us that Sinkiang is there. But
every item is carefully filed by Mrs
Blasch, such random items as “The Rus-
sians are preparing for a new series of
atomic tests in the Far East, notably in
the most recent centre established some-
where in the Sinkiang desert”, and “Crack
Russian troops are being rushed to help
Red China in a desperate bid to smash a
massive anti-Communistic revolt sweep-
ing from Tibet to northern China and
Mongolia”.
The longest reference in some time
said: “Among Peking’s suffering subjects
special torments are visited on those who
live in Red China’s own Wild West, the
twice Texas-sized, rugged but rich Sin-
kiang province. In Sinkiang, as in neigh-
boring Tibet, the Chinese are an invading
minority. Half a million Chinese are
outnumbered by 4,500,000 hard-riding
zenophobic Moslem herdsmen, the
Uighurs and Kazakhs, who pledge
friendship by daubing their foreheads
with lamb’s blood. In a difficult period
of rehabilitation, landowners were dis-
possessed and shot, tight food rationing
imposed and 12,000 ‘incorrigibles’
shunted into six big forced labor camps.
When Peking proclaimed its Great Leap
Forward, Sinkiang, normally a pastoral
land, was marked out for a big coal and
steel centre at Kuldja. While grain rot-
ted in the fields and neglected herds died,
farmers were dragooned into factories,
construction sites and 451 communes.
Early in their occupation, the Chinese
Reds wiped out Sinkiang’s original Mos-
lem leaders.”
It is hard to see, and hard even for
Mrs Blasch to explain, the fascination of
a primitive country in central Asia for a
Viennese woman, who even now retains
the gay vivacity that is so often taken as
characteristic of the people of that city.
She is a Catholic, Sinkiang is a Moslem
country. She was a teacher, yet when she
went to Sinkiang there was no school
system, no hospitals, except at the one
Catholic mission, and few of the things
that make life safe, much less easy. And
her personal memories of the country
are most unhappy. Her husband was
arrested there is 1939. She heard nothing
more of him until his death certificate
issued by the Soviet Government came
through the post to her at Cabarita in
Sydney in 1960.
Blasch left Vienna in 1926 to
A accompany her brother and her future
husband to Ksyl-Orda in Kazakhstan.
They were members of a group of idea-
listic Austrians who planned to found a
colony there. After only six months it
became obvious that the Soviet Govern-
ment would not let them do as they
planned and instead wanted them to be-
come the basis of a co-operative. The
colony was disbanded. Mrs Blasch stayed
on in Kazakhstan. At one time she work-
ed at a prison camp. Ninety-thousand
people passed through her hands there.
In 1933 she and her husband went to
Sinkiang after receiving an invitation
from the Chinese Government to work
on a hydro-electric scheme.
Sinkiang’s population then was made
up mainly of six Moslem tribes, a colony
of White Russians and some Chinese.
The Blaschs went to the city of Kuldja,
which was mainly a market for the farm
produce from the surrounding districts.
Transport was by horse, donkey or mule
in a primitive town in which animals
were slaughtered in the butchers’ shops
and the blood ran away in a wooden
trough, providing food for packs of stray
dogs.
But Sinkiang was never cut off from
the world as was neighboring Tibet. It
was on the Great Silk Route and through
the centuries had contact with both East
and West. Quite extensive trade was
done with Germany and Britain. The
country produced wool, meat, butter and
grain for export.
At the end of World War II the
Americans sent a token force of two
planes and five men to Sinkiang. Typi-
cally one plane was loaded with provi-
sions: tinned goods, flour and sugar.
“Sending provisions to Sinkiang”, she
says in her two-volume, unpublished
memoirs, “was bringing trees to the
forest”.
“One of the worst mistakes the Chi-
nese Communists have made was to turn
Sinkiang into an industrial centre and
take people from their farms into the
coal-mines”, she said. “When we were
there the Sinkiangese mined only enough
coal for their own needs. But the Chi-
nese took them as forced labor into the
mines and lost production from yet
another rich area which could have
helped solve China’s chronic food prob-
lems”.
The Blaschs’ hopes of doing useful
work in Sinkiang were short-lived. Six
months after they went there in 1933 the
Russians moved in at the invitation of
General Sheng Shin-ts’ai, the governor
of the region who assumed the role of
dictator. For the first time Sinkiang had
secret police and mass arrests and de-
portations began. In 1939 Mrs Blasch’s
husband was arrested.
Throughtout the Second World War
Sinkiang remained cut off, although it
had some disparate distinguished visitors.
In 1942 Madame Chiang Kai-Shek went
there. This was the first time, Mrs Blasch
said, that Chiang’s name was allowed to
be mentioned in the province, although
Sinkiang was still formally part of China.
In 1944 the Vice-President of the United
States, Henry Wallace, and Chinese ex-
pert Professor Owen Lattimore also visi-
ted Sinkiang. Soon after their visit Bri-
tish and American consulates were set up.
Some years afterwards Vice-President
Wallace admitted that during his visit he
had been hoaxed into accepting a group
of prisoners, cleaned up for the occasion,
as new settlers in the virgin lands.
At one stage during the war the popu-
was ordered to take either Soviet
or Chinese citizenship. “After some hesi-
tation”, Mrs Blasch said, “I applied for
Chinese citizenship but heard nothing.
Eventually I saw the commanding officer.
He said he was sorry that I couldn’t obtain
Chinese citizenship because Australia was
already one of China’s allies. I explained
I was Austrian, but the files showed Aus-
tralian and could not be changed, he
said. This mistake was about the luckiest
thing that happened to me in those years”.
Eventually the American consul at
Urumchi offered Mrs Blasch a job as
his housekeeper. She made the journey
from Kuldja to Umurchi by horseback

in three weeks, because the Soviet air-
line would not issue her with a ticket.
In 1947 Mrs Blasch and her son left by
air for Lanchow and eventually came to
Australia via Shanghai and the Philip-
pines.
About 200 people, mostly White Rus-
sians, eventually came to Australia from
Sinkiang. Mrs Blasch believes there is
only one “foreigner” living there. He
is part-German, part-Polish and was born
there and has lived nowhere else. She
does not write to friends there because
she believes it would only make life more
difficult for them. Two years ago, by
what she regards as some miracle, she
received a letter from a Moslem friend
there. Mrs Blasch believes that General
Sheng Shin-ts’ai, who first invited Soviet
troops to Sinkiang and who initiated per-
secutions there, may now be living in
peaceful and untroubled retirement in
Taiwan.
Although Sinkiang seems almost in the
past 20 years to have dropped off the
face of the earth, Mrs Blasch believes,
with some mixed feelings, that this will
not continue. “Who owns Sinkiang is
the Lord of China”, was the old saying
and this, she feels, can still hold true. It
can easily be imagined that Russia is
thinking now about the missile testing
bases which, in happier times, it estab-
lished on Chinese soil in Sinkiang. The
determination of China, as a growing
nuclear power, not to give up the testing
bases may equal Russia’s determination
to get them back. Whatever happens,
little consideration will be given to the
wishes or rights of the Sinkiangese.
A Game of Skill
Australian history in stamps
By M. H. ELLIS
C electing Australian stamps is a
much more advanced art or
science than collecting Australian
furniture books or pictures and old prints.
For one thing it is a much older interest,
there are more skilled collectors, more
stamps, more kinds of stamps, more per-
mutations and combinations of stamps
and more variation in individual stamps.
There has also been more destruction
and more deterioration of old stamps,
since colors were not so fast in the early
dates, letters were apt to be more roughly
handled, and, in the earliest stamps, there
were no perforations and the scissors
very often went awry on the sheet.
Till 1809, there was no organised post
office in New South Wales and little
need for one. In that year, however,
Lieutenant-Governor Paterson received
complaints of “numerous frauds . . .
committed by individuals repairing on
board ships . . . and personating others,
by which they have obtained letters and
parcels, to the great injury of those for
whom they were intended”. So, on April
25, 1809, he was “pleased to establish an
office at which all letters and parcels
addressed to the inhabitants of this colony
shall be deposited previous to their dis-
tribution, which office should be under
the direction of Mr Isaac Nichols” a
trusted emancipist and father of one of
Australia’s earliest Cabinet ministers who
was serving as assistant to the Naval
Officer (i.e., Collector of Customs).
It was not till June 23 the following
year that Macquarie established a “regu-
lar” post office which dealt with internal
as well as overseas mails at Nichols’
house in High (Lower George) Street,
the postage being 4d. for local letters
and 2s. 6d. tor parcels under 20 lbs. and
Bd. for overseas mail, though only a
penny for soldiers’ family mail. Postage
was paid over the counter on delivery
and not usually by the sender. Mail was
unstamped.
The first and only hand stamps on
Australian mail known to collectors be-
fore 1829 are two or three isolated in-
stances on letters to the London Mission-
ary Society’s headquarters in England in
1819.
f|%us, the only kind of early “stamp”
there is to collect among Australian
issues are the “franks” of Governors and
high officials entitled to send mail free.
Most of these are immured in official
collections. Mr Robson Lowe, one of
the two great stamp auctioneers of the
United Kingdom, who has just left Aus-
tralia, however, tells me that he has two:
one a cover franked by Governor Mac-
quarie, another by Governor Bligh which
he values beyond price. These franks,
whether as franks or as autographs,
would be valuable. I should be surprised
if they brought less than £5O in the open
market in Australia.
Though an Act of Council established
country post offices and regular mail
services in N.S.Wales and to an from
Van Diemen’s Land in 1825, the first
hand stamps that now survive date from
1829 when Governor Darling reformed
Ihe whole postal system and appointed
the first salaried postal staff. One of the
regulations provided that, “each post-
master is carefully to stamp each letter
delivered in at his office, with the appro-
priate post office seal, on the day on
which it is put in and to write legibly
thereon the postage with which it is
chargeable, endorsing those letters on
which the postage is paid, at the time of
being delivered with red ink, and un-
paid letters with black ink . . He will
further mark the words “Post Paid” on
letters of the former description and the
word “Free” on letters which are not
liable to postage.
These endorsements are the first forms
of real “stamp” in use in Australia and
historians and antiquarians were apt to
hate the early collectors of them who
only a few years ago began to garner
them, since they were apt to cut the
stamp from the original which sometimes
was of considerable historical signifi-
cance, thus destroying it. Sometimes
they destroyed documents and autographs
of more value than the postmaster’s
markings.
This form of stamp collection, how-
ever, has a restricted clientele because of
the limitation of the range of material
available. The people most interested in
it are those in the Post Office Historical
Society. Real collecting begins with the
issue of Australia’s first true adhesive
post stamps the Sydney Views and
Queen’s Heads of 1850, which came out
10 years after the first English (and the
world’s) adhesive stamps.
Normal copies of these imperforated
botches locally printed by'Charles Kay
from copper plates, are not beautiful. It
is rare to find specimens that have not
faded —indeed, even experts cannot quite
agree about exactly what the original
type of blue in the two-penny was. The
picture on the penny is a crude reproduc-
tion of the Wedgwood’s New South
Wales Seal sent out in Governor Phillip’s
day. The two-penny-blue is a very raw
picture of the Queen wearing a laurel
wreath.
To place valuations on a world basis,
Stanley Gibbons catalogue the unused
penny-red and twopenny-blue of the
first 1850 plating at £lOO and £l5O
sterling respectively, but Mr Lowe tells
me that he has never seen copies of the
blue which could be called in mint con-
dition. Any mint copy would bring con-
siderably more money. Prices up to
£4OO have been paid for some specimens.
And there are all sorts of other factors.
For instance, the place at which the
stamp is postmarked. Each N.S.Wales
post office had a postal number. Stamps
and envelopes marked with the Parra-
matta number are worth less than many
others because they are relatively plen-
tiful. But a No 93 would bring a much
higher price. It is the number of Boyd-
town. Very shortly after adhesive stamps

came in in 1850, Boydtown was closed
down after Ben Boyd left it, and its
number in philately is rare indeed.
Normal not-much-obliterated copies of
the original two stamps of the Mother
Colony are worth from £l5 to £2O ster-
ling. And, of course, where they are
on envelopes and there are two or more
stamps on an envelope they rise consider-
ably in value. Only an expert can say
how valuable any particular stamp or
group or sheet of pioneer stamps is. All
that can be said is that any average copy
of one of the first issues in good condi-
tion is probably worth from £2O to £4O
Australian if postmarked and/or faded
not too heavily, and may be worth a lot
more; and that unused copies may be
worth anything from £125 upwards.
These originals, however, are not the
most valuable of N.S.Wales stamps nor-
mally printed. The eightpenny yellow
of 1851 is catalogued at £175 sterling;
the eightpenny orange of 1854 at £250.
Tt is strange that one of the crudest of
Australian stamps, and not one of the
earliest at that, is Australia’s most valu-
able stamp. It is a freak the “inverted
Swan” 4d. of 1854 has brought four
figures.
The most valuable of normally printed
Westralian stamps is the 1854 sixpenny
green £4O sterling.
The highest-priced of first issues by
colonies are also the most beautiful.
Queensland’s original 1860 imperforate
red penny, a work of art in philatelic en-
graving, is worth £65 sterling unpost-
marked and £5O postmarked. But the
2d. blue is catalogued at £275 and the
6d. green at £2OO. The same year simi-
lar stamps were issued perforated. But
to the joy of collectors there are so many
sorts of permutations and irregularities
among these rarities, that it is possible
to make up a Queensland collection of
early issues in singles and sheets which
drives addicts into hysterics. One such
collector in Sydney, within the post-war
years, by sheer knowledge has accumu-
lated a cache of stamps and sheets and
blocs of early Queensland issues said to
have a market value of £30,000.
Victoria ran practically neck and neck
with N.S.Wales in issuing its first stamps
—a penny, two twopennies and a 3d.
blue. They are not so valuable as the N.S.
Wales originals. As everybody knows,
Victorians were a verbose and literate
people who wrote many more letters, ap-
parently, than others, with the result that
even the best unused copies of the first
originals are catalogued from £2O to £55
sterling. The most valuable Victorian
stamp is the 6d. orange of 1860: priced
by Stanley Gibbons at £ll5 sterling un-
used and £25 used. A Tasmanian penny
blue original 1853 is marked up at £95
sterling unused and £3B used. But South
Australia’s Is. orange of 1855 is quoted
at £175 unused and £45 used, the half-
penny green at £BO unused and £3O used,
the 6d. blue at £2O and 335.
Apart from all these, no matter what
the colony it is very rare to find any
Australian colonial stamp valued at more
than £5 sterling.
Incidentally few people realise that
though Norfolk Island is part of the
Commonwealth, it is the only part of it
included in Australia proper and inha-
bited by electors voting at State and
Commonwealth elections, which issues
its own stamps. These are a source of
considerable revenue. The Island made
its first issues in great abundance
in 1947 and late years has been in the
habit of issuing a Christmas stamp. It
is remarkable that its stamps in artistic
quality are far ahead of the modern and
horribly banal productions of the Com-
monwealth.
All the States used their own stamps
until 1913 when the Commonwealth
brought out its first issue of 18 deno-
minations from id. to £2—the £1 brown
and blue 1913 (£2B sterling and £8) is the
most valuable of them.
Lastly in the Australian field are
New Guinea and Papua. German New
Guinea had two issues in 1897 and 1900,
but the only “straight” stamp of these
which has value is the 5 mark red and
black of 1900, which, strangely enough,
is catalogued at £2O used and only 40
shillings unused there were large
numbers of the latter available when the
Australians took over in 1914.
The normally most valuable stamp of
the Australian zone is this red and black
5 mark mentioned and surcharged ss.
by the Australian Occupation Force in
1914. It is worth £4OO, used or unused.
A 3 mark of the same 1900 issue en-
dorsed for 3s. in 1914 is priced at £225
sterling and half a dozen denominations
of the same surcharged issue can bring
from £lO to £B5 in London. Papua did
not issue stamps till 1901.
Australia shines in a new field of
postal collection because of its unique
record in air pioneering, its air mail
“firsts”, in stickers and envelopes. New as
this department is there is already a hand-
book (itself already pretty rare) published
in 1955 by that avid connoisseur and
collector Ernest Crome and edited by
N. C. Baldwin.
The first of the hundreds of these
items is stamped “First Aerial Mail Great
Britain to Australia, 26 Feb. 1920”. It
bore a special Commonwealth Air Stamp
and Mr Crome illustrates a specimen
autographed by Ross Smith and W. M.
Hughes but this is not the world’s
earliest aerial mail envelope, which dates
from Allahabad, India, on February 18,
1911. The earliest of regular air mails
was the Qantas flight of November 2,
1922, Longreach-Charleville and a lot of
turbulence has gone on since then and
a lot of historic mail dated.
"I grant you , it's nouveau, it's chic and it makes her look jeune,
but it happens to be mine."


These are the dimensions of Alcoa aluminium
Alcoa are not content merely to make
aluminium. Respecting its talents, they
research its potentialities. In their hands
aluminium has become inspirational, in-
dispensable. Alcoa aluminium is helping
transform the world around us. Alcoa
take bauxite, our most common mineral,
and from it produce a metal with most
uncommon properties. Light enough to
be flown or floated, aluminium can face
the years and come out shining. It can
be tiny or towering, and made any colour
of the spectrum. It can be worked by
all known metallic processes, and its
abilities extended by alloying. Capable of
infinite variation, endless applications,
Alcoa aluminium is truly the metal of
tomorrow. Fortunately we have it today.

SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
Out of the Depths
If Noah had been a zoologist he
would have embarked his animals
systematically, arranging species by
genera, genera by families, families by
orders, orders by classes, and finally
classes by phyla—a tapering pyramid
of classification. There are millions of
species but in the whole animal kingdom
only 20 or so phyla. Neither mammals
nor insects rate more than a class. The
discovery of a new animal phylum—in
the sense of finding hitherto unknown
species so unusual that they cannot be
placed in any recognized phylum—is a
development more surprising, if less
dramatic, than the discovery in 1938 of
the first living Caelacanth, Latimeria
chaubnnae; for, although the group of
which Latimeria was a member had been
thought extinct for some 70 million
years, the group as such was known
from fossils.
Like Latimeria, the animals classed as
Pogonophora—the new phylum—live
below the more accessible surface waters
of oceans and seas. Unlike Latimeria,
they are bottom-dwellers: usually they
are partially buried in mud, clay, silt or
ooze, typically at depths between about
600 ft. and 13,000 ft., though also both
shallower and deeper. They are small,
thread-like creatures, an inch or more
long, with their bodies divided into three
segments, and they live in close-fitting
tubes formed of material that they
secrete. They get their name from a
bearded tuft of tentacles.
They have taken time to make their
mark. The first species was described by
M. Caullery in France, as long ago as
1914, from a specimen collected in the
East Indies some 14 years earlier during
an expedition in a Dutch vessel, the
Sibogo. He could not place it system-
atically, described it only briefly, gave it
the generic name Siboglium after the
ship, and left it at that for 30 years.
Meantime, in 1933, a Russian, P.
Ushakov, had described a different
species quite independently—this time
from the Okhotsk Sea. This, too, had an
odd history. Named Lamellisabella
zachsi by its discoverer, it was placed in
a new group four years later by a Swede,
K. A. Johansson, after he had examined
and redescribed it. After a further five
years, another Russian zoologist, V. M.
Beklemishev, found it so odd an animal
that, in a textbook on invertebrates
published by the Academy of Sciences
of the USSR, he gave it the status of
a phylum—though he later went back
on this view.
Real progress dates from 1949, when
A. V. Ivanov, of Leningrad University,
became interested. Within two years he
had connected Lamellisabella from the
Arctic with Siboglinum from the East
Indies —and the hunt was on. Now, more
than 100 species have been reported
from all five oceans as well as from
some coastal seas, and some 70 of these
have been fully described. Marine bio-
logists of many countries have con-
tributed. A book by Ivanov, who has
remained a central figure, has been lately
published in English translation. Dr Eve
C. Southward, who works at the Marine
Biological Laboratory, Plymouth, and for
more than five years has been engaged
in research on the group (in part with
her husband, Dr A. J. Southward),
has written a general review.
The best hunting grounds up to the
present time have been in the north-west
Pacific where Soviet research vessels
have worked intensively. But at the rate
at which pogonophores are being found,
Dr Southward thinks that other areas
may eventually be found that are equally
rich. On present form, pogonophores
occur mainly on the continental slopes,
in some deep trenches and basins
(notably the Kuril-Kamchatka Trench,
where several species have been collected
from depths approaching 30,000 ft.), and
around some oceanic islands.
/"|ne of the odd points that has emerged
is that, while individual species
have an apparently limited range geo-
graphically, some can tolerate a remark-
ably wide range of depth—-in an extreme
case from about 70ft. to more than
26,000 ft. Another is that their apparent
lack of an alimentary canal poses a
problem about their means of nutrition.
One suggestion is that they filter food
from the surrounding sea water; another
that they collect food from the surface
in which they live; a third that in some
way they may be provided by bacteria
with a source of soluble food; still
another that they may have glands in
their epidermis which produce digestive
enzymes, so that any food that may be
available to them is converted to soluble
form.
Their reproductive system has been
examined by Ivanov, who has found all
the species that he has studied to be
bisexual. They have a closed circulation
system containing large quantities of red
blood, and a vessel, surrounded by a
thick muscular sheath, which Ivanov has
termed a heart.
In the course of a dozen years the
pogonophores have passed from obscurity
to wide and active interest. Argument
about their status has subsided, largely
through the work of Ivanov. The new
phylum which they form is widely
accepted as being close in evolutionary
terms to the echinoderms which
include, for example, starfish and sea
urchins—and to the chordates, that is,
the vertebrates. They have themselves
been divided (by Ivanov) into two
orders. There is much more to be found
out about them.
There are whole areas of research on
which little or nothing has yet been done.
Yet, on a broad view, knowledge of them
seems well on the way to catching up
with that of other and longer-known
groups. Interesting in its own right, the
story of the pogonophores is also a good
advertisement for the present increased
effort given to research in oceanography
and marine biology. (The “Times”
London.)

Pretensions
Of a
Pretender
Vive Henri VI?
By HERBERT LOTTMAN
An increasing number of French-
men believe that the next Pre-
sident of the Republic will be,
simultaneously, King of France. His
Royal Highness Prince Henri, Count of
Paris and would-be King Henri VI, has
been working quietly but fervently for
the restoration of his throne: “10 hours
a day for the past 34 years,” as a French
journalist recently remarked. Behind
him is a large personal fortune, the
esteem of General de Gaulle, and a
group of devoted followers. His avail-
ability has been a fact of life ever since
the death of his father, the Duke of
Guise, who was the previous pretender.
The question mark is the attitude of
General de Gaulle, whose term as Pre-
sident ends in 1965. Has he, as some
suggest, been consciously preparing the
way for restoration of the monarchy?
Serious political commentators as well
as the popular press are devoting more
and more attention to the subject.
Not long ago, for example, the influ-
ential weekly “Express” headlined its lead
article, “Why de Gaulle has Chosen the
Count of Paris.” Henri is de Gaulle’s
choice as his successor, “Express” affirm-
ed, “and the Count of Paris knows it.”
“Express” cited the Count’s own draft
constitution published in 1948 and
containing many similarities to the Fifth
Republic's 1958 Constitution which
provides for a monarch who judges, ar-
bitrates and “incarnates the Nation and
symbolises the continuity and perma-
nence of la patrie.” (Interestingly, the


Fifth Republic struck out the previous
ineligibility of members of the royal
family to become President of the
Republic.)
De Gaulle and Henri have been meet-
ing privately several times a year. De
Gaulle also has sent the Prince to Africa
and Asia as his personal representative,
and reportedly to Spain as well. In turn,
Henri has been an outspoken Gaullist.
In his Information Bulletin, 40,000 copies
of which are published and circulated by
a private secretariat with a building of
its own in Paris, he has often supported
Gaullist positions.
“La Succession . .
TAuring the Algerian War, Henri wrote:
“Don’t break with your own
future, follow General de Gaulle. He is
the hope for France, Algeria, he is your
safeguard.” Shortly afterwards the
French Secret Army planted a plastic
bomb at his spacious home in suburban
Louveciennes, causing great damage but
claiming no victims only because the
Count and his family were absent at the
time. (His second son, Frangois, died on
an Algerian battlefield in the fall of
1960.)
The Count of Paris, it should be said,
is not necessarily aiming at an immedi-
ate restoration of the monarchy. A
recent book entitled “La Succession,” by
former Socialist Deputy Arthur Conte,
leaves a place for Prince Henri in French
government if he is willing to accept the
substance (election as President) without
demanding the symbol (a crown) as well.
Similarly, it is recalled that the Count’s
direct ancestor, the Duke of Orleans,
was willing, as a 19th-century com-
promise, to stand on a balcony with
Lafayette holding a tricolor flag and to
be elected Louis-Philippe not King
of France, but King of the French.
When he launched his newsletter in
1948 the Count of Paris made it clear
that he, too, was addressing himself not
to monarchists, but without distinction
to all Frenchmen. A brochure he pub-
lished that year on his life and political
ideas added that he favored an elite of
ability as opposed to one of money or
birth, was against violent means of tak-
ing power, and wished to be called on by
the people as an arbiter. At the age of
24 he favored a corporate state system,
but later confessed to being wrong. He
has been an outspoken democrat and
champion of social justice according to
his own philosophy ever since, and has
consistently voiced opposition to dic-
tatorship.
Nor is the count of the traditional
monarchist school. He opposed the
Right-wing “Action Frangaise”, stated
publicly that he did not read the extremist
weekly “Aspects de la France,” and
repudiated the idea of a bloody coup to
gain power. In 1938 he illegally entered
France to hold a press conference to de-
nounce the Munich Pact, an event which
disheartened the traditional royalists
grouped around Maurras, who adored
Munich.
Indeed, every public statement of the
Count’s in recent years has indicated
moderation (in French terms) and a
close parallel to Gaullist philosophy.
Far from being hostile to the notion
of restoration of the monarchy, the
petit peuple seem to be excited by every
public reference to it. A weekly picture
magazine for miclinettes has read much
significance into General de Gaulle’s
1960 letter to Henri on the death of his
son in Algeria. Addressing the Count
by his proper title, Monseigneur, de
Gaulle wrote: “The sacrifice of the young
Prince Frangois, killed gloriously for
France, adds an exemplary service to
all those his race has given to the
country and which are the thread of our
history.”
The Count had initially come to de
Gaulle’s attention in wartime Algiers,
when the former’s partisans hoped to in-
stal him as head of the provisional gov-
ernment. “Express” claims that de Gaulle
has privately sounded out the Church on
Henri’s candidacy, but the Church was
not quite happy about once again link-
ing its destiny to the monarchy.
Count of Paris is a direct
A descendant of Philippe Duke of Or-
leans (1640-1701), of Louis-Philippe-
Joseph (Philippe Egalite), and of King
(of the French) Louis-Philippe (1773-
1850). The first Philippe was the son of
Louis XIII (1601-1643) and brother of
Louis XIV (1638-1715). The family’s
main line, which runs through Louis
XV, Louis XVI, and the restoration
King Charles X, was broken in 1883
when Henri X, Count of Chambord,
died without heirs. From that time on
the Orleans family, in the ardent opinion
of its supporters, became the royal line,
with Prince Henri being the current
candidate for the throne.
A minority opinion holds that the
real French royal family descends more
directly from a son of Louis XIV:
Philippe Duke of Anjou (1683-1746),
who became King of Spain (Philippe V)
and renounced his French nationality
and his rights to the throne for himself
and his descendants. In this view, the
rightful pretender is Jacques-Henri,
Duke of Anjou and of Segovia, son of
King Alphonse XIII of Spain, born in
1908. Jacques-Llenri’s branch of the
family, the argument runs, became heir
to the throne in 1883, at the death of
the Count of Chambord.
But the Orleanists maintain that Jac-
ques-Henri cannot be the pretender, since
he descends from Philippe V of Spain,
who renounced the throne both for him-
self and his descendants. The partisans
of Jacques-Henri reply that if Philippe
V’s renunciation was valid, was not
Philippe Egalite’s too? (At the time of the
French Revolution, he voted for Louis
XVLs beheading and renounced title
to the throne for himself and all the Or-
leans to follow.) In 1947, Pretender
Jacques-Henri issued a declaration to the
effect that he was legitimate heir to the
throne. The fact remains, however, that
his claim has neither the public appeal
nor historical solidity of the Count of
Paris.
Still, a counter-offensive has come
from the extreme Right. Unhappy at the
Count’s liberal tendencies, factions on
the Right seek revenge for his anti-
colonial attitude. The Rightist monthly
“Charivari”—whose editor was recently
sentenced to a month in prison for of-
fence to the Chief of State devoted
12 pages of its July issue (with charts)
to a learned expose on the pretenders to
the throne, concluding that the Count
of Paris was at best heir of a “fifth
dynasty” (that of Louis-Philippe), but
refusing to accept the Orleans family as
legitimate heirs to the Bourbons. What-
ever his.genealogical pretensions, “Chari-
vari” declared, several other candidates
(Jacques-Henri, Prince Napoleon, Prince
Xavier de Bourbon-Parme), by virtue of
their Right-wing convictions, are more
deserving of the throne than the Count
of Paris, “who incarnates practically
nothing of what we want.”
A most confidential agent
HPhe Count of Paris was born in 1908
in the Aisne department of France
and raised in Morocco. He was not for-
bidden by French law from visiting
France in his youth, for two cousins
who preceded his father in the line of
succession were still living (they died
without heirs, in 1924 and 1926 re-
spectively). In 1931 he married his cou-
sin, Isabelle d’Orleans-Bragance, descen-
dant of a parallel branch of the Orleans
family and the emperors of Brazil.
The Count is not by any means a poor
man. He owns vast forests in France,
the Chateau of Amboise in the Loire
valley, and 160 acres near Estoril, Por-
tugal, not to mention his wife’s Latin
American wealth and his mother’s lands
in Morocco.

in an attempt to keep Italy out of the
War and obtain information from the
royal families in Athens, Sofia and Bel-
grade, Henri served as a confidential
agent for France. Though prohibited
from entering France, he travelled with
a false passport in the company of a
French plainclothes agent who himself
was unaware of the Count’s identity.
Henri wanted to enlist in the Army,
but the French Government refused to
allow him to do so. In June, 1940, how-
ever, he was authorised by Premier Paul
Reynaud to enter the Foreign Legion
(which his grandfather had founded) un-
der a pseudonym and as a private. After
demobilisation he returned to Morocco,
where he became involved in plotting,
both on behalf of Free France and of
himself.
He later made a trip to Vichy to try
to persuade Marshal Petain to move to
Algiers. (He also saw Pierre Laval, who
rejected the idea of easing the way for
the Allies in North Africa.) On his re-
turn to Rabat the Americans were land-
ing, and he saw them fired on by the
French at Port Lyautey. Admiral Darlan
took power in Algiers in the name of
Petain. Both Gaullists and other Free
French discussed the possibility of re-
placing Darlan with the Count of Paris.
United States Consul Robert Murphy,
the Free French and the Jewish colony
offered no objections.
The Count reached Algiers with a false
passport. Fie has since said that at that
point Eisenhower blocked his chances
for taking over by refusing to allow him
use of the radio. For his part, Henri
refused the suggestion of royalist officers
that he stage a coup. Suddenly news of
Darlan's assassination arrived, and the
Count himself was accused of being one
of the killer’s inspirators. General Gir-
and's manoeuvring for power put an
end to his pretensions, especially when
Roosevelt ordered Giraud’s installation
as chief of government at Algiers.
Since that time the Count has never
stopped campaigning. Through his trav-
els, his publications, his encounters with
chiefs of government in France and
abroad, he has been his own greatest
promoter. Wherever he goes, the crowds
cheer him and his family as they cheer
the royalty of Great Britain, Belgium,
or any other country.
“Sooner than one expects, France . .
HThe future of Henri Vl—his legal name
is Henri d’Orleans, but he prefers
Count of Paris, which was Hugues
Capet’s name too has 10 living child-
ren. The family still lives the life of
royalty anywhere, attending balls and
charity sales. When the Count of Paris
travels to the provinces he is received
in white gloves, with an honor guard;
his partisans say he avoids high society
and prefers to talk with labor leaders.
“It is possible,” the Count of Paris has
said, “that sooner than one expects the
French will need the principle of stability,
impartiality, and superior justice that I
represent, without feeling the need to
rebuild a throne. A grave crisis could
take place requiring an arbiter not avail-
able in the parties to avoid dictatorship.
If at the moment I can be useful to the
country, I should be at its disposal with-
out raising the question of regime. The
principle incarnated by me can be valu-
able even in a Republic. This happened
in Algiers. It could happen again.”
“Would you agree to be President of
the Republic?” he was once asked in an
interview.
“No,” he replied. “The Constitution
forbids it.”
But this was before the Fifth Repub-
lic’s Constitution dropped the interdic-
tion. Now the Count is eligible to be
next Chief of State. In “La Succession”
Arthur Conte says: “Nobody any longer
smiles at the idea.”


CENSORSHIP
Sir,
Members of the Sydney Branch of
International PEN view with great con-
cern the increasing erosion of free ex-
pression in Australia. The censorship of
books, which frequently operates to
exclude works by writers of inter-
nationally acknowledged talent and
integrity, passes largely without com-
ment because people do not realise what
is happening. Recent events in the field
of radio and television, however, have
implications that are clear to everyone
and have aroused widespread misgiving.
The latest instance —the action taken
by the RSL over a recent “Four Corners”
programme, followed immediately by
the transfer of the Editor, Mr Alan
Ashbolt, to another post —is a flagrant
example of submission to indirect
political —or quasi-political—pressure.
The ABC denies that Mr Ashbolt’s
transfer is connected with the incident,
and insists that its timing was purely
coincidental. This denial, bringing to
mind familiar and well-tried totalitarian
tactics, is alarming. It sidetracks open
discussion of the issue, and succeeds in
imposing a passive censorship on succeed-
ing programmes. Recent experience
suggests that “Four Corners” from now
on will be carefully shorn of any fact or
opinion that might reflect on the estab-
lishment or cause offence in any in-
influential quarter.
Free investigation and open contro-
versy on all its aspects are essential to
a healthy society, and the ABC should
be an important agent in this process.
Ceding its autonomy is an evasion of
responsibility, and we wish to record
strong objection to the Commission’s
action.

PROGRESSIVE TAXATION
Sir,
Roger Randerson (12/10/63) quotes
Professor Hayek in opposition to pro-
gressive taxation it “necessarily offends
against what is probably the only uni-
versally recognised principle of economic
justice, that of ‘equal pay for equal
work’ ”. Granted this principle, it is
hard to see what relevance it has to pro-
gressive taxation, for it relates to one-
aspect of equity in taxation that of
“horizontal equity”. This means that
people of the same economic standing
should be taxed equally. If we accept
“income” as defined in our tax laws as
an adequate indicator of economic well-
being (after suitable concessional deduc-
tions have been made), then progressive
taxation does not offend against the
principle of “horizontal” equity.
Progressive taxation has to do with
“vertical” equity the treatment of
peoples of different economic well-being.
We may agree that occupations paying
the same yearly income represent “equal
work”, but how do we arrive at work
equivalence when dealing with doctors
(at £3OOO p.a.) and storemen (at £lOOO
p.a.)? We need some new principle.
Economists, from Bernoulli to Abba
Lerner, have attempted to derive a “scien-
tific” basis for progressive taxation (the
latter wanted an equalitarian income
distribution). These attempts failed, as
do the attempts to justify proportional
taxation. Instead of using some “eco-
nomic” or pyschological basis, most
economists point to the fact that the dis-
tribution of income which results from
the working of our mostly free enter-
prise economy is not acceptable to our
democracy, and is accordingly modified
by taxation, social services, etc. It is
a case of accepting laissez faire as a
system of allocation of resources in the
economy- but rejecting it as a system of
distribution of income.

SYDNEY COVE
Sir,
Mr M. H. Ellis recently stated
(21/9/63) that Arthur Phillip landed at
Sydney Cove and displayed the colors
on January 25, 1788. My impression,
confirmed by David Collins (Account,
2nd edition, 1804, pp 9-10), is that
January 26 is the correct date. I find it
strange that Mr Ellis, so frequent and
passionate an exponent of absolute
accuracy, should have erred; stranger that
he should not have admitted his mis-
take; strangest that no experts have taken
the matter up. I can only suppose Mr
Ellis’ methods of argument have silenced
potential critics. This is disastrous for
freedom of expression.

THE ARMSTRONG 500
Sir,
David McKay’s review (5/10/63) of
this year’s Armstrong 500 race at
Bathurst was an excellent if somewhat
biased commentary. We are more in-
terested even than Mr McKay to ensure
that this event becomes a public test of
the cars offered to the Australian buyer
over our everyday roads, with no chanca
of disguising a car’s weaknesses.
The regulations for this year’s event
were even more stringent than for
previous years. For example, all cars in
the 1963 “500” were required to make
the first wheel change assisted only by
the standard tool kit normally supplied,
all wheel changes thereafter using the
standard car jack. However, as Mr
McKay is well aware, the Confederation
of Australian Motor Sports specifies that
all cars competing in events such as the
Armstrong 500 must make a number of
modifications in the interests of safety
to be eligible to compete under its
regulations.
The spirit of this event is to ensure
that only Australian-produced or as-
sembled cars which are available to the
average Australian motorist are eligible to
compete, notwithstanding your cor-
respondent’s assumptions. All actions on
the part of both organisers and pro-
motors were to ensure that the “500”
did not revert to just another car race
for specially built racing cars.

ABORTION
Sir,
As a general practitioner I contend
that the granting of legal abortion in
cases such as the NSW Humanist Society
quotes (5/10/63) will give rise to un-
happiness, social chaos and disease which
will far outweigh the benefits mentioned.
By far the greatest deterrent to giving
way to momentary passion is the fear
of pregnancy. If abortion is made as
easy as the humanists indicate this
deterrent will be minimal, and there will
be a resulting increase in promiscuity,
with far-reaching social consequences.
In England, a well-known professor of
gynaecology writes in a recent textbook
that the major cause of an alarming
increase in venereal disease is the in-
crease in promiscuity. I see no reason
why this will not happen here.
D. S. BEAVIS
Portland {Vic.).
Sir,
Although the NSW Humanist Society
is to be commended for its concern with
a “social problem of great magnitude”,
the conclusions suggested cannot
be accepted. We can see no merit in
the argument that abortion should be
legalised, since the present law negates
the pregnant woman’s right to a free
choice. But surely any law, no matter
what its purpose, involves some limita-
tion of the individual’s right to act as he
chooses?
Nor can we accept the proposition
that because the abortion laws makes
criminals of an estimated 20-25 per cent
of all women in Australia, these laws are
necessarily unjustified. No doubt a large
proportion of the population at some
time commit offences against the road


accounts themselves, the assets con-
cerned being included in omnibus
figures for the whole group.
This is one of the disadvantages of
publishing only consolidated accounts.
The auditors could have assisted inter-
pretation by being more specific in their
qualification instead of merely referring
to the loss they anticipate if the company
is successful in its efforts to sell Broad-
beach as a “very substantial” one which
would effect the total amounts shown in
the consolidated balance sheet for fixed
assets, shareholders’ funds and so on.
At any rate the chairman, Mr R. R.
Markillie, admitted at the meeting last
week that the auditors’ qualification was
a proper one but that “if and when a
sale is concluded there will be sub-
stantial savings in interest charges and
other overhead expenses, which may be
fairly set-off against any capital loss and
when the extent of such loss is ascer-
tained any necessary adjustments will be
promptly made in the accounts under
full advice to shareholders.”
He made the further point also that
the board regarded Ihe three Queens-
land hotels as one unit and from this
standpoint the undoubted value of the
investment cannot be gainsaid from
either capital values or profit angles.
Shareholders will obviously have to wait
until the delayed event of selling the
hotel is consummated before knowing
what the real effect on balance sheet
figures will be.
Unhappily Mr Markillie was unable
to report that any improvement had
taken place in the earnings of the group’s
three Melbourne hotels so far this year,
though he spoke optimistically of the
benefit the whole group would obtain
from the new Menzies Hotel in Sydney
which was opened by Mr Heffron last
week.
A Disturbing Turner
HPhe sudden adverse turn in the fortunes
• of Turner Industries, the Victorian
hardware and appliances maker, which
caused a drop in profit from £117,582
to £71,555, and the cut from 10 to 8 p.c.
in the dividend in the year to June 30
last, looks to have stemmed from
internal weakness as well as the cold
winter wind in the company’s trading in
appliances and the discovery of bad
debts.
Coming so soon after the company’s
successful one-for-four new issue, which
raised ordinary capital from £839,375
to £1,082,954, the revelations on these
matters are disturbing, the more so as
in March (before the issue) the company
reported that profits in the first half of
the year had been steady and all
appeared to be plain sailing.
Now the directors say that trading in
the appliance division was unprofitable
in the last three months and in fact the
losses incurred during that time more
than offset profits earned from these
products in the first nine months. The
major factors contributing to this were
the excessive bad debts of £34,000, in-
tense competition and price cutting in
laundry appliances, and a sudden falling
off in the demand for motor mowers
manufactured by the company. In the
interests of liquidity it was necessary to
dispose of stocks at greatly reduced
prices.
The board says it has taken moves to
correct a number of weaknesses which
have been disclosed. Production of un-
profitable lines has been discontinued.
The company has withdrawn from the
domestic appliance field in all States
except its own home State of Victoria
where the newly-developed automatic
washing machine can be sold and
serviced more adequately.
Also, management has been
strengthened, particularly on the financial
side. The board says it hopes to sustain
the 8 p.c. dividend during this period of
rehabilitation.
That hope will clearly be dependent
on a substantial improvement in trading,
because, as it was, the 8 p.c. was paid
on capital before the new issue and in
fact was only just covered by earnings.
To justify the same rate on the higher
capital, earnings would have to increase
by 25 p.c. without leaving anything for
reserves, which in any case are rather
sparing in relation to the increased
capital.
Looking Backwards
HPractor and earth-moving equipment
distributor Waugh and Josephson
Holdings ran in reverse for the trading
period to June 30.
The loss of £278,157 was the first in
the company’s public history and was
after charging adjustments of £335,690
against trading results. This was very
largely a re-appraisal of stocks—in other
words a good old-fashioned write-down.
Bad or doubtful debts and capital losses
completed a gloomy picture.
The market had been half-prepared
for this debacle by the interim report
of a loss and no dividend for the first
half.
Most of the difficulties are presumably
a hang-over from the “squeeze” days.
Directors have now taken a cold, hard
look at the situation. Certain attempts
at diversification have been discontinued.
It is hoped directors have been ruth-
less in cutting away deadwood, so that
1963-64 will show a return to reason-
able profitability.
Trading since balance date has been
profitable, it is reported.
Statistics of Australian tractor sales
and stocks show a much healthier trend
this year:
Sales Stocks
6 months to June, 1961 .... 8,482 19,959
6 months to June, 1962 .... 9,961 12,362
6 months to June, 1963 .... 11,128 12,140
The market knocked the 20s. W and J
shares down to 12s. 9d. immediately on
hearing the latest news. This may sub-
sequently prove to be a bargain level.
Final judgment should be suspended
until the accounts and directors’ report
are published.
Electrolytic Propulsion
Tncreased production and higher zinc
prices propelled E Z Industries profit
for the year to June, 1963, to the second
highest level yet, after a two-year slump.
The profit of £2,343,009 gave an
earning rate of 13 p.c. and prompted
directors to restore the 10 p.c. dividend
rate.
As the spot price for zinc on Lon-
don Metal Exchange is now about
£stgBl 2s. 6d., compared with £76 Is. 3d,
at the end of September, and £63 16s. 3d.
at the end of September, 1962, the price
trend is very healthy indeed for E Z.
Since CRA’s Cockle Creek smelter
came into production, EZ’s sales
pattern has shifted strongly into exports.
In 1961-62, 54 p.c. of zinc sales went to
22 countries outside Australia. These
exports carry tax concession advan-
tages. (The tax provided in 1962-63 was
£1,079,000 compared with £1,124,000
the year before.)
So at 17s. the 10s. shares now yielding
5.9 p.c. seem due for a price rise when
the directors’ report and annual accounts
are released shortly.
Easier Interest Rates
T7or the third time in 12 months
Industrial Acceptance Corporation
has cut interest rates on debenture issues.
Interest offered on long-term deben-
tures is 61 p.c., which is i p.c. more
than that offered by the two finance
companies (CAGA and AGC) in which
bank ownership is relatively greater.
Dodging The Subtle Analyst
A mongst the wealth of information
presented in the annual accounts of
H. C. Sleigh Ltd, the lay readers should
find the answer to almost every question
on the group’s activities during the year
to June 30. This fact and the manner of
presentation should make Sleigh a
stronger contender for the Balance Sheet
Award.
What the accounts lack for the finan-
cial analyst, though, is a dissection of

The solution to the problem of “Shot-

DISCRIMINATION IN PAPUA-NG
Sir,
Mr Ken Appleton (12/10/63) chal-
lenges my account of racial discrimina-
tion in Papua-New Guinea. Examples
are:
Within a few days of arrival in Port
Moresby, an Australian academic told
how a recent cabin booking for one of
his staff was refused when the shipping
company realised the member was a
Papuan, i.e., colored. It is true that
most Papuans and New Guineans pay
lower fares, but there is little doubt that
the travelling conditions they suffer are
so inferior to the facilities enjoyed by
whites that Papuans are in effect over-
charged.
In a flight with Ansett-MAL from
Rabaul to Lae a three-course breakfast
was served to European passengers but
not to the New Guinean family sitting
across the aisle from me. I checked their
tickets and they had paid the usual fare.
Only after a protest to the hostess did
they receive coffee and a biscuit.
Despite Mr Appleton’s denial I still
believe that many hotels deny Papuans
and New Guineans use of facilities on
grounds of color. The exclusion may be
superficially on grounds of dress or
behavior, but observation suggests the
real basis is race.
In the matter of clubs, Mr Appleton
is evading the issue. Discrimination
occurs not in refusing non-members the
use of club facilities, but in the frequent
exclusion of Papuans and New Guineans
from membership. This color bar may
not be written in the club rules, but the
unwritten de-facto rule is quite effective.
An example of this discrimination
recently occurred in a Port Moresby
service club.
Overall, racial discrimination does not
appear to be the major Territory racial
malaise. The student delegation were
even more disturbed by the almost total
lack of genuine social intercourse between
the expatriate and indigeneous com-
munities. This social isolation of Papuans
and New Guineans is a major obstacle
to their social and political progress.

REVIEWS
TELEVISION
The Spice of Life
Television’s infinite Variety
By FRANK ROBERTS
iy|osT of the Australian-made television
programmes shown nights and week-
ends are musical. In Melbourne last
week some 17 hours of musicals were
televised, about the same figure as the
total for all sports, discussion, quiz,
documentary, opera, drama and ballet
programmes for the week. In Sydney the
musicals had about 11 hours, and all
the others about 15. Melbourne’s total
was swollen by the six hours of “In
Melbourne Tonight”, and as most of the
other capitals with the notable exception
of Sydney have a similar nightly show,
the Melbourne ratio would be the typical
one.
For a nation supposedly mad about
sport, our television has more guitars
than cricket bats, with only seven hours
of sports programmes in Melbourne and
eight in Sydney. The reluctance of major
sports to have their games televised, and
the fees some of the less reluctant
demand, have much to do with this. We
seem unlikely to see film of the First
Test in Brisbane for one of these reasons,
but on that Saturday we will be able to
view Brisbane’s “teen talent miming the
Top 40 tunes” as usual.
Variety may be the spice of life, but
in television I wonder if it is not one of
the irritants causing the slow but per-
sistent decline in the peak number of
sets in use, while the totals of all sets is
still increasing. And I arrived at that
thought after reading a lecture by one of
the variety stars, Miss Lorrae Desmond,
who called on “every little tinpot critic”
to stop grinding out his “half-baked,
misinformed opinions about what’s wrong
with it (TV) and us.”
Then, to show us very clearly what
might be wrong with television variety,
she declared that in order to perfect an
act a performer must polish it before a
live audience, “develop a sensitivity to
the reactions of an audience. How can
you do that when you’re entertaining a
television camera?”
I can only suggest that Miss Desmond,
and the other Australian variety artists
who might agree with her, consider the
numerous people who have spent their
lives entertaining movie cameras. And
all the other kinds of artists—the actors,
writers, painters, composers—who can
get along without a live audience. They
do it and review it, and learn. Perhaps
this ability separates the professionals
from the enthusiastic amateurs.
It cannot be said too often that tele-
vision is television, and nothing else. If
Miss Desmond imagines that working to
cabaret audiences will make her a hit
with television audiences it may explain
some of the things that must puzzle her
viewers. The kinds of people who inhabit
night-clubs are not even vaguely related
to Bill and Mary and the older kids
grouped around the TV set.
Nor are the average people in the
average television audience of up to
200,000 very closely related to the
adulatory few who go along to the
studios regularly to shriek with laughter,
clap or cheer anything and everything.
Or related to the paying customers at
teenage dances, hootenannys and shin-
digs where the long-haired idols work.
npHESE are traps which most of the tele-
vision variety performers not only
fall into but actually seek out, because
it’s the tradition. Night after night we
viewers sit watching the Joe Martins,
Le Gardes, Delos and Dalys, the Bryan
Davies, and some who have passed from
the scene, go through routines and
mannerisms and twitchings which para-
lyse the audience —actual or in mind—
which they are confronting, but only
bore their viewers or make them laugh
in the wrong places.
It’s easy to be a misinformed tinpot
critic, or, as another gentleman put it,
a “cultural jackal”. (It isn’t always so
easy, however, to be a suffering viewer.)
It is easy to be a poor television per-
former and still work in television. But
the good ones know when they are,
know when they are not, recognise their
faults and fix them.
The few variety performers who know
include Tommy Hanlon (he plays on
peoples’ emotions), Johnny O’Keefe,
Dave Allen in Sydney, the new Bobby
Limb, Dawn Lake, George Wallace, and
among those who are purely comperes,
Brian Henderson. That is not to say any
one of them is a marvel, but each has
developed as far as he can, and for the
viewer not for the claque.
However, one person does not make
a variety show, nor even two people
such as O’Keefe and Ron Way, his in-
telligent and adventurous producer. If the
rest of the talent has little, or has some
but dresses badly or is not photogenic,
or resembles ten other people in appear-
ance and presentation (like those in-
distinguishable groups with guitars and
interchangeable voices and clothes), then
it’s a poor show.
Any of the performers, especially in
the youth shows, could be steered right
if someone behind them would realise
that television gives unique opportunities
for developing an image. If a girl is
gauche, there are surely ways of pre-
senting her so that it is minimised?
Usually, instead, she’s on camera in jeans
or a model ball gown, or as Miss Chest-
cake 1963 —and bang on camera at that.
Why not use talented but less than photo-
genic artists in ensembles. And why take
such a man as John Laws, with an
already developed style and personality,
and try to give him an entirely unsuit-
able “image” instead of letting him rip,
as a wiser producer is letting Dave Allen?
You can sing like the Sirens, but if
you look or behave badly, Bill and Mary
and the kids are apt to switch channels
ruthlessly. As they may if you’re the
Delltones being “interviewed” for the
thousandth time, or the Le Gardes being
as commonplace as ever. Such things
are making variety dangerous to present.
There are too many similar shows, too
few new faces, voices and personalities,
and too few sound ideas of what tele-
vision variety should be about. It is
symptomatic that while this is so among
the performers, the camera techniques
are becoming bolder, the sets and the
use of design and lighting are very good,
the audio expert, like a civilisation about
to become over-civilised and fall to
pieces for lack of substance.
As they say, you’ve got to have heart,
and in television that’s the performers.
It’s up to production to give each artist
a setting proper to him, not try to fit
him into an alien setting, or a series of
indoor-outdoor settings as James Upshaw
tried with Lorrae Desmond in the first
of her new shows. Some artists need to
be kept back from the camera, some to
front it all the time. And all of the per-
formers need to be told that they are
working for us, out there, and we’re the
warmest, easiest to please people they’ll
ever encounter. Those last three words
are one hurdle that has to be jumped


before we will have good variety on
television.
Another, as Miss Desmond remarked,
is that “a sameness is developing.” And
the answer is “writers with new ideas
for new approaches . . . and the im-
portance of adding immediacy, warmth
and human interest to a show.” Or
perhaps, in other words, adding some
genuine humor, both written and ad
libbed. But I think that several of the
tinpot critics have been saying that for
a year or two. Not that it seems to have
done any good. But it is nice to know
that Miss D. agrees with us on something.
FILMS
Meteor
Marilyn. Mayfair, Sydney.
a woman, young, beautiful, be-
loved and successful, dies possibly
by her own hand, there is always a temp-
tation to canonise her. This is happening
with Marilyn Monroe, and it is accepted
now that she was the greatest actress of
the century and the beauty of the age.
Of course she wasn’t either. As an
actress, she had a considerable and
developing talent for a sort of rueful
tragicomedy. Physically she was endowed
with an impressive body and a pretty
face whose irregularities somehow added
up to a gentle radiance.
It is also the fashion now to “under-
stand” what made Marilyn Monroe tick,
and why her outwardly triumphant life
ended in the lonely way it did. It seems
to me impossible to know and impertin-
ent to guess. But perhaps it is safe to
say that she was the classic example of
the person whose dreams came true and
turned out to be disappointing. Through-
out a miserable, unsettled childhood, she
longed for affection, praise, security. She
got them all, in a measure vouchsafed to
few, but it turned out they weren’t the
way she dreamed them, after all.
The film “Marilyn” won’t help anyone
to plumb the mystery of Monroe’s life.
In fact, it discreetly avoids any overt
reference to her personal problems. It
merely gives excerpts from some of her
films, linked by a reverent, uninforma-
tive commentary spoken by Rock Hud-
son.
Since the film was made by Twentieth
Century-Fox, the producers have concen-
trated on their own movies (and not
all of those). So we miss the remarkable
impact of her early appearances in
M-G-M’s “The Asphalt Jungle,” and
some later films, for instance “The
Prince And The Showgirl”, “Let’s Make
Love”, “The Misfits”, all important in
her personal as well as her artistic
development, are ignored.
BEVERLEY TIVEY
Wine List
Days of Wine and Roses. Director,
Blake Edwards. Regent, Sydney.
The List of Adrian Messenger. Direc-
tor, John Huston. Lyceum, Sydney.
11/f aking films about alcoholism must be
■"■■■ a fairly discouraging exercise. “Days
of Wine and Roses” is by any standard
a good and engrossing film, but its Syd-
ney season is apparently due for a swift
demise. It cannot beat the natural human
reluctance to go and see a film about
drunks.
Those with the hardihood to see it
have found that although the film has
its share of horrors it is not merely de-
pressing, and although it makes its point
forcibly enough it is not merely a ser-
mon. Its writer (J. P. Miller) and director
(Blake Edwards) have kept an admirable
balance between the need to hold the
viewer’s interest and sympathy and the
secondary purpose of getting across an
idea. They have riskily juxtaposed com-
edy and disaster without committing
errors of taste, a considerable achieve-
ment in itself.
The two central figures, a husband
and wife who follow separate psychologi-
cal paths to joint boozing, come touch-
ingly to life in the performances of Jack
Lemmon (a skilful actor whose comedy
roles have often hinted at a capacity for
pathos) and Lee Remick.
The screenplay presents the most
mature treatment of the subject of al-
coholism that I have seen. Its approach
is compassionate but not sentimental,
realistic but not sensational, and it avoids
the vulgarity of an inspirational happy
ending the story ends, as it probably
would in real life, in a somewhat messy
and precarious situation. The direction
is orthodox but telling.
About the only things in common be-
tween “Days of Wine and Roses” and
John Huston’s “The List of Adrian Mes-
senger” are the number of words in the
titles and the fact that both hold the full
and ungrudging attention of the viewer
throughout their length (although the
former stands up better in retrospect).
“Adrian Messenger” is a blandly esca-
pist, outrageously artificial mystery thril-
ler which might be listed in Huston’s
canon as what Graham Greene would
call an “entertainment”, along with “The
African Queen” and “Beat the Devil.”
With its theme of curious crime and
its collection of improbable characters it
invites some comparison with “Beat the
Devil.” But it has not got the wild, witty
unexpectedness of that film, nor has
it got Truman Capote as a screen-
writer. Its story (by Philip MacDonald)
suggests John Buchan more than anyone
else, with an admixture of Conan Doyle
and that is, I suppose, about as far
away from Capote as you can get.
The breathtaking coincidences on
which the plot hinges are certainly Buch-
anesque, as is the pukka, upper-class
English background which makes tne
modern dress seem anachronistic. But
within its conventions the whole thing
works most convincingly; the ingenious
plot, a sort of non-comic “Kind Hearts
and Coronets”, engages one’s curiosity
and permits the willing suspension of
disbelief; Huston’s narrative technique,
culminating in a splendidly filmed fox-
hunt, is always masterly.
MARTIN LONG
LETTER FROM TOKYO
The Music
Upstairs
VlTith musicians from many parts of
** the world visiting Japan in increas-
ing numbers, that country is rapidly be-
coming an important international centre
of Western music.
There is an enthusiasm here for the
music of the West especially among
the younger generation which amazes
visitors from abroad. Concert halls
and there are excellent ones in most of
the larger cities are filled practically
every day. It is estimated that in Tokyo
alone a total of 2,350,000 music en-
thusiasts attended approximately 2000
concerts last year.
This receptive attitude on the part of
concert audiences has been an important
factor in attracting musicians from over-
seas and during the past six years many
of the world’s greatest musical organisa-
tions have visited Japan. Symphony or-
chestras included the Leningrad Philhar-
monic, Boston Symphony, London Phil-
harmonic, Leipzig Gewandhous, and Am-
sterdam Concertgebouw; and opera
groups were the famous Lirica Italiana,
Paris Opera, and Vienna State Opera.
Ballet companies included the New York
City Center, Russian Bolshoi, and Royal
Ballet from London. Many outstanding
chamber music ensembles and world-
famous solo-artists also toured the
country.
The large-scale importation of artists
has stimulated the development of West-
ern music in Japan and the city of
Tokyo can boast of five professional
symphony orchestras, all giving regular
series of subscription concerts; two well-
established opera companies; and numer-
ous instrumental chamber music en-
sembles and choral groups, professional
as well as amateur.


Widespread music education has
helped make this situation possible. For
the past 75 years singing has been in-
cluded in the curriculum of all secondary
schools and in many high schools. The
Tokyo Academy of Music (now the
Music Department of the University of
Arts) was established in 1887 and is
today one of five colleges of music in
Tokyo offering advanced study to a total
of 5000 or more students. A growing
number of young musicians are con-
tinuing their study overseas, many on
scholarships provided by governments
of foreign countries, and they later make
careers for themselves at home or abroad.
Before the Second World War, German
music instructors predominated in Japan
and the concept of the supremacy of
German music and music traditions pre-
vailed, almost to the exclusion of other
styles. Best-sellers in the recording in-
dustry were not, as in most countries, in
the field of popular music, but were so-
called classical works such as Beethoven’s
Fifth Symphony and Mendelssohn’s
Violin Concerto. In 1937 the Victor and
Columbia recording companies printed a
report with the headline, “Japan Outdoes
Europe In Classical Music Sales
Nation Turns Rapidly to Works of Best
Western Composers.”
Today, however, the Japanese people
reveal a much more catholic taste and a
Japanese writer stated, “There are no
other people in the world who are so
carried away by the love of music and
who support enthusiastically so many
types of music.” While Beethoven is still
the most popular composer, the works of
modern composers such as Bartok, Brit-
ten, Webern and Thompson are also ap-
preciated.
A small but earnest group of Japanese
composers are experimenting in various
contemporary European styles. Some are
admirers of Stockhausen and Boulez and
adhere to the 12-tone serial system;
others, following the example of the
Russian nationalist school, employ the
melodies and rhythms of their native
music in Western forms; still others adopt
an eclectic style incorporating the charac-
teristics of late European romanticists.
Even avant-garde and experimental styles,
such as electronic music and the works of
John Cage have their followers.
Japanese composers are frequently
criticised as being too imitative of Euro-
pean music and of failing to base their
works on the traditional music of their
own country. But the problem is a com-
plex one not easily solved. For example,
Ikuma Dan, a young composer of operas
and symphonies, says, “Since the Japanese
people now wear Western-style clothes
and ride in subways, why should they
write music in the idiom of Japan of
several hundred years ago?”
Then there is the question as to
whether the music of Japan and that of
Europe can be successfully amalgamated,
as the two systems are diametrically op-
posed. Some interesting experiments are
being carried out, however, including a
Kabuki-style opera by Osamu Shimizu,
and a ballet based on Bugaku (ancient
court music) by Toshiro Mayuzumi. Sym-
phonic works in a variety of styles have
been commissioned by the Japan Phil-
harmonic Orchestra and performed at
their regular concerts. The Tokyo Sym-
phony also presents contemporary Japan-
ese works.
Another post-war development is the
tremendous enthusiasm of the younger
generation for the popular music of the
West. Recordings of the latest American
jazz, French chansons, and Latin-Ameri-
can rhythms can be heard throughout
the country in the numerous tea-rooms,
bars, and restaurants almost as soon as
they are released abroad. Jazz musicians
are flocking to this country to appear
in concert halls and in night-clubs and
the Japanese musicians are successfully
organising their own bands.
117’hy this tremendous enthusiasm for
** Western music in Japan? Particular-
ly as the people have a well-developed
traditional music of their own? These
questions are frequently asked and receive
a variety of answers. A high school boy
replied, “We hear only Western music
at school and Japanese music sounds
strange to me.” On the other hand, many
members of the older generation still
prefer the sound of the “samisen” (3-
stringed lute) or the “koto” (zither-like
13-stringed instrument) and the wavering
tone of the minor-sounding melodies of
feudal days.
Perhaps the most discriminating answer
was given by Koichi Nomura, noted
music educator and music critic, in
these words, “The music of Beethoven
speaks to my heart but the traditional
music of my country conveys no message
and is capable of providing merely a
fleeting, sensuous pleasure.”
The history of Western music in Japan
goes back about 100 years when the early
Protestant missionaries taught the people
to sing the simple melodies of hymns.
Instrumental music was introduced a
little later by the British soldiers guarding
the Legation in Yokohama. The lively
music of their marching band entranced
the feudal warriors who requested Wil-
liam Fenton, the band leader, to teach
them to play the instruments of the
West. In 1880 Luther Whiting Mason,
an American music educator, was invited
by the Japanese Government to assist in
establishing music in the schools. He
trained teachers, compiled song books
and laid the foundation for compulsory
music education in schools throughout
the country.
Famous artists began coming to Japan
in 1921 when Mischa Elman gave his first
concerts in Tokyo and he was followed
by Schumann-Heink, Kreisler, Galli-
Curci, Chaliapin, and many others. In
recent years the Osaka International Fes-
tival, which is held each spring, has con-
tributed largely to the influx of musicians.
After appearing in Osaka the artists also
give concerts in Tokyo and other cities.
Another important means of dis-
seminating Western music has been radio
and television. NHK (Japan Broadcasting
Corporation) reported recently that the
number of households with radio and
television sets now number more than
181 million and that 64 per cent of the
total number of households in Japan
view TV programmes. This means that
symphony concerts, opera productions,
and Western music of all kinds reach
homes in practically every town and
hamlet throughout the nation.
The amazing development of Western
music in Japan has no parallel in the
history of music and if the present rate
of progress continues the country may
soon become one of the most important
world centres of music. But can Japan
become a centre of the music of East
and West? At present the majority of
the people do not appear to be seriously
interested in Eastern music, including
their own, and a Japanese musicologist
wrote regretfully, “We need someone to
awaken us to the value of our own tradi-
tional music just as we required Fenel-
losa, a foreigner, to make us aware of
the beauty and importance of our visual
arts.”

Ninth Subscription Concert. Mel-

/"\ne of the rare pleasures of my years
in the concert-hall has been to watch
the slow revolution of taste by which
critics have come to see the merits of
Shostakovitch. In my early years he was
“in” with a fringe group because he was
a Russian —these were the post-war years
of the East-West honeymoon, the years
in which Australia-Soviet Friendship
Societies had their brief efflorescence. But
he was always “out” with the reviewers,
and particularly with the writers of pro-
gramme notes, which were usually cog-
ged from some English source. Even the
tizzy and delightful Piano Concerto was
never played except partly as an
exercise in refined amusement, with
accents on the brawling bar-room tunes
of its last movement. Before 1950 the
respectable Neville Cardus was writing
of him almost as one writes of the still-
born music of the British ’eighties, and

he spoke of the “decline in the selection
of ideas after the Fifth Symphony”. But
the lyrical spring in Shostakovitch has
refused to dry up under the deicidal
incantations of the critics, and in time
the critics have died or changed their
rubrics or both. The Ninth, Tenth and
Eleventh Symphonies have been written,
decline or no; Shostakovitch is now “in”
with all except a fringe group, and one
may enjoy a performance of his prentice
First Symphony to the accompaniment
of programme notes which are soberly
appreciative.
Thomas Matthews’ performance was
in fact very enjoyable, as was this whole
concert even surprisingly so, since it
looked rather lukewarm on paper. The
Mozart violin concertos (of which
Maurice Clare played the Fifth) do not
always come off well in modern perfor-
mances. Young, relaxed and compara-
tively diluted music, they seem to demand
the easy space of al fresco summer
nights, the regimented artifice of formal
orange groves: often to hear them in the
Town Hall is too much like hearing a
singing bird in the air-conditioned rec-
tangularly of a drawing-room in Toorak.
But this performance was redeemed by
two things the impeccable taste of the
soloist’s playing, and the strong direction
through which the conductor raised so
full a body of tone from his reduced
band.
This strength of tone was in evidence
through the entire programme, and
added a little excitement to a perform-
ance of the interesting but dated “Sin-
fonia da Requiem” of Benjamin Britten.

HThe CAS is to be congratulated on its
effort to bring together a selection of
overseas paintings (lent by various air-
lines) to commemorate its 25th anniver-
sary. As the members often reflect a per-
sistent internationality of outlook, so
much the better that their work be seen
in wider company. Two of the British
painters, Francis Bacon and Patrick
Heron, are represented by works only re-
motely approaching their usual stand-
ards. The David Hockney seems pretty
equivocal, especially since this is possibly
the only painting of his shown here and
critics have no comparisons to make.
Bacon’s “Man in Blue” hardly effects the
hate-filled impression of horror of his
best work. With the use of glass Bacon
accommodates the reflection of the
viewer who only gradually realises its
translation into the screaming, contorted
visage beneath. This absence of glass
prevents the “Man in Blue” from leap-
ing out of the dark, but the heavy her-
metic space marked with lines suggests
Bacon’s method if not its fullest realisa-
tions. Few of the French, Dutch or In-
dian paintings offer anything beyond the
aims of local artists.
Margo Lewers’ “Closer Development”,
which won the £5OO R. H. Taffs award
with a full-bodied, less textured paint-
ing, seemed appropriate in view of the
fact that few of the rest showed equally
mature work. Guy Warren, Sibley, whose
appeal seems now to emanate from
Fairweather, Reddington, whose luscious
paint has dried, Shay Docking and Stan
de Teliger, might be numbered among
these. Ratas and Salkauskas supported
with graphics, Crothall’s clinical spaces
together with Michael Brown’s send-up
of Madame Butterfly made a useful con-
trast to the overblown, pretentious,
boring and half-baked stuff that tended
to drown the small-scale or serious work
in the rest of the show.
Australian paintings sell in London
and now we have a notable experiment
with an Australian dealer offering 46
European paintings and graphics for
auction in Sydney. This two-way traffic
promises the healthiest results for col-
lectors and artists, withheld from close
contacts overseas.
While the collection reflects an ob-
vious line of taste following figurative and
to some extent decorative trends, at least
it. is intelligent. The suavely lyrical Re-
noir landscape is excellent, likewise the
Moise Kisling “Paysage de Provence”,
two delightful Bauchants and two Laur-
encins. Mintchine is represented by a
rare gouache, “Musicien et Ange”, and
there is a particularly fine painting by
Ossip Zadkine of two sisters. Of the
school of Paris, Buffet’s gothic linearism,
Venard’s subtle elegance and Carzon’s
theatrical mannerisms will be particularly
welcome. Dufy’s exuberant “Promenade
des Anglais” emanates characteristic
charm, the Henri Hayden a sensuous re-
straint. English painters Piper, Richards,
Sutherland, Wood, Vaughan support with
fascinating minor works, Braque and
Chagall with superb lithographs and
Lurgat is represented by two oils offer-
ing marked contrast to his magnificent
tapestry entitled “Le Coq sur la Table”.
Little-known paintings of quality by art-
ists virtually unheard of here underline
the interest and variety of this collection.
It is a considerable feat for an artist,
himself deeply influenced by Utrillo, to
paint Parisian streets with a verve entirely
his own. This George Lawrence achieves
with a greatly enriched palette. His
European tour ranged from England to
Greece but there is no hint of Mont-
martre commercialism in the authenticity
of light and atmosphere which he cap-
tures in each place. Lawrence’s rich im-
pasto and firm control of shape adds
vigor to the post-impressionist idiom
into which he breathes new life.

The Desert Wolf
Homosexuality and Lawrence of Arabia
By M. H. ELLIS
338171 T. E. Lawrence of Arabia.
Victoria Ocampo. Gollancz. 15s.
HThe title, suggesting that the Lone Wolf
of Arabia has been posthumously
listed as the winner of an Opera House
Lottery, introduces one recent attempt
to interpret the character and motives of
the leader of the Revolt in the Desert
(another is in David Lean’s film version,
opening this week in Sydney). The au-
thoress is a Spanish-Argentine whose ori-
ginal text in French has been translated
into English by David Garnett. She never
saw, much less knew, T. E. Lawrence.
One suspects, since she likens the gaucho
of the Pampas to the Arab, that she has
never seen or known an Arab, either.
Her facts and impressions seem to have
been gleaned from Lawrence’s mother
and two surviving brothers. The younger
of them, Professor A. W. Lawrence, an
archaeologist of Cambridge, pronounces
the monograph, which is only about
18,000-20,000 words long, to be “the
most profound and moving of all por-
traits of my brother.” One is apt to dis-
trust the verdicts of brothers, especially
those in so unusual and unconventional
a family as the Lawrences.
Donna Ocampo’s essay appears to be
based mainly on an attempt to exculpate
Lawrence from, or excuse him in respect
of, charges of sexual eccentricity. In pur-
suance of this aim, she produces her
picture of a man whose “worst fault was
in taking delight in too many acts of
self-denial” and whose “soul was crippled
like that of Arjuna on the field of battle;”
one for whom nothing “could dissipate
the anxiety which paralysed him; one
who no longer desired victory or power;”
one who “had to feel that all his acts
testified to the ideal standard of every
moment.”
In the slight contact I had with Law-
rence I never noticed that his soul was
in any way crippled, either on the field
of battle or otherwise. He was just as
matter-of-fact in his descriptions of Arab
warfare as any officer of the Australian
Light Horse. And I found him equable
rather than anxious and anything but
paralysed physically, mentally or spirit-
ually.
However, Donna Ocampo turns over
his life and writings with a long pick,
her mining illuminated only by the dull
light of inexperience but promoted by a
prospector’s natural ardor and delusion.
The thinnest leader of dull quartz some-
times seems to infuse her with the con-
viction that she had discovered a wide,
four ounce gold lode.
Most of the significances evident in
Lawrence’s own writing seem to me, like
the report of Mark Twain’s death, greatly
exaggerated. To this authoress, as to
most critics, the fact that Lawrence saw
fit to describe in exact detail sexual
“abnormalities” abnormalities, that is,
as understood in Victorian England, but
not in Asia leads to the deduction that
he was himself a participant in the prac-
tices of his men. But probably all that
can be justly deduced is that, as the ac-
ceptor of “Arabia Deserta” as his “bible”
and his literary style and meticulousness
as his legacy from its author, grand old
Charles Doughty, he set down facts
which concerned a perfectly normal fea-
ture of Arab life in wartime, as he found
them.
ITHithout them his picture would have
" been incomplete. And there is little
reason to believe that he was more in-
volved than, say, any commander of
Indian border levies or the mates of
Oriental freigiiters just as accustomed as
himself to practices not looked on as even
unconventional among the warlike tribes
and sailor fraternities of Asia. Moreover,
his knowledge of Ancient Greece would
have habituated him to the idea of
homosexuality.
The emotionalism of his writing on this
and other phases of his subject is
introduced as part of the contributory
evidence of aberration. He himself wrote,
“Never was so shamelessly emotional a
book.” And this emotionalism was ob-
viously introduced with deliberation, as
a device of communication, to enable the
reader to absorb the book on the same
level of excitement as the participants
in the events and feelings which it de-
scribes.
A natural part of the discussion of
Donna Ocampo’s dominating theme is
her chapter on the dedication of the
“Seven Pillars of Wisdom” a title
drawn from the book of Proverbs, Law-
rence having a sort of atavistic feeling
for the sacred number “seven” which
so obsessed all ancient civilisations
Seven deadly Sins, Septem contra The-
bam, Homer’s Seven Cities.
The dedication will probably never be
elucidated further than Lawrence him-
self explained it: “S.A.— i.e., the person
to whom the book was dedicated—■
‘was a person now dead, regard for
whom lay underneath my labor for the
Arab peoples.’ ” The verse which follows
the specific dedication “1 loved you,
so I drew the tides of men into my hands,
and wrote my will across the stars, to
earn you freedom, etc.” has been
pawed over for clues. These are very in-
conclusive, though the general deduction
of the searchers (some of whom are only
scavengers), seems to be that the whole
thing has some abnormal sexual signi-
ficance. The equation of “S.A.” with a
donkey boy named Dahoum who, (Law-
rence wrote) “could read a few words of
Arabic, who talks of going to Aleppo to
school and on whom I will keep my eye
to see what happens,” seems more than
a little absurd to anybody who has ever
seen an Arab donkey boy, and Law-
rence; just as untenable is Donna
Ocampo’s conviction that Lawrence
would not have invented “S.A.” as an
allegorical figure, since he would not
have so descended to deceive and in-
trigue the small band of intimate friends
for whom alone she believes that “The
Seven Pillars” was originally intended.
This hypothesis might be all right were
it not for a fact that I have never seen
mentioned by an investigator or critic:
that Lawrence, before the publication of
the “Seven Pillars,” wrote an abridged
account of the Revolt for publication in
a London newspaper, the London
“Daily Telegraph,” if I remember cor-
rectly. The proofs of this he showed me
some time in the late autumn of 1926.
And to it was attached as an introduction
Kipling’s verse which begins:
When 1 left Rome for Lalage’s sake
On the Legion’s road to Rimini,
She said her heart was mine to take
and ends bitterly, “I’ve lost Britain and
I've lost Gaul, I’ve lost Rome”, etc.
I suggested that a much more powerful
beginning to the article was its arresting
first sentence: “It was hot in Jidda,”
which gripped the imagination at once.
He became rather grimly silent under
some gentle chaff and said the verse had
a very personal meaning for himself.
Certainly the Lalage of Horace
“sweetly laughing Lalage . . . sweetly
prattling” with her Greek name, was
not either asexual or homosexual in any
sense. The commentators would do well
to have a look at Kipling and at the
22nd Ode of Horace’s first book in con-
junction with the Dedication to “S.A.”
I myself find no more trustworthy
guidance to the actuality of Lawrence’s
nature in his dedication than I do in
the letter he wrote Lionel Curtis, which
Donna Ocampo quotes, about the lecher-

ous agonies and nocturnal cryings-out
of the rank and file of the RAF in bar-
racks at Cranwell, having heard what
might be described as his colloquial ver-
sion of the matter. This was that the
average British ranker, whether sleeping
or in nightmare, appeared to have only
two basic words in his vocabulary —-
both of four letters, both obscene and
both repeated with ceaseless iteration in
every context except their prayers
which, he added, they did not appear
ever to say.
LPhe business that brought me into
contact with Lawrence was that I was
about to lead a British semi-official motor
car party from London to India and I
wanted expert advice, from someone who
knew, about a few foreseen problems.
Through a cousin of his friend Willy
Nicholson, I was introduced to Law-
rence. I found him very much like a lot
of the withdrawn ascetics of the Aus-
tralian bush, like, also, many members
of the celibate priesthood. He seemed
very strong physically. He gave his ad-
vice sound and practical concisely.
In a number of conversations over sev-
eral months I gleaned that he did not
consider himself an Arabic scholar;
merely a “parlyer in diggers” ( i.e
archaeological) argot.” Asked how he
had achieved so great an influence over a
people with whom he could not com-
municate with clarity, he replied: “By
means of the most ancient of vocabu-
laries those of yellow gold and black
arms.” He did not over-estimate his
small military achievements. He was
warm in his praise of Allenby and
Chauvel’s Light Horse. He was an out-
door man in good shape who at 38 was
still capable of riding at any speed the
road would stand, his roaring Brough
Special “Boanerges;” though with tragic
foresight he discussed the slowing down
of one’s reactions at the handle-bars or
wheel and a growing inability to keep
in mind the important fact that at a
mile a minute the eye is focused a thous-
and yards ahead of the driver.
The creeping onset of these deficien-
cies was probably the cause of his death
in a motor-cycle crash in 1935. On the
whole, he was much less theatrical in
appearance, mind and manner than is
popularly represented. He made his own
behavior logical. He had an almost quil-
pish sense of humor. He had one great
dislike Lowell Thomas who destroyed
his privacy; and two abiding loves,
Thomas Hardy, and above all the white-
bearded Charles Doughty to whom he
played chelah and to whose “Arabia
Deserta” he decided that the “Seven Pil-
lars” should become a natural addendum.
I suspect that Doughty was all along his
mentor while the book was being written.
Scapegoat
Laval. Hubert Cole. Heinemann.
435. 6d.
Ilf hen France collapsed in 1940 three
courses were open to her military
and political leaders. They could escape
and join the resistance movement gather-
ing round De Gaulle. They could accept
the armistice terms legalistically and
“correctly”. Or they could collaborate,
to a greater or lesser degree, with the
conquerors in the hope of alleviating the
fate of their countrymen. To those who
believed in the inevitability of Britain’s
defeat (and the belief was shared by
many in Washington as well as Vichy)
there was much to be said, on practical
grounds alone, for the third course. We
have been lectured ad nauseam about
the alleged moral decay of pre-war
France, about her defeatist generals and
corrupt politicians. In fact, it is remark-
able how few important figures Petain
managed to collect in his hotch-potch
administration in Vichy.
The dominating influence in Vichy
was Pierre Laval. While the old marshal
preached and postured, Laval did the
dirty work of negotiating with Hitler’s
bullies. At first he had considerable hopes
of success. Laval honestly believed that
Britain was doomed and that France’s
salvation depended on her adapting her-
self to the stern realities of the New
Order. He credited Hitler with recognis-
ing the value of a strong, friendly France
in the new Europe and he believed he
was the only French politician shrewd
enough to exploit this fact. Laval was
fatally deluded not because his plan was
morally reprehensible but for the simple
reason that Germany lost the war.
Hubert Cole has done his best for
Laval. He gives him due credit for
courage and toughness in his dealings
with the Nazis, for his efforts to pre-
serve the facade of Vichy independence,
to bring home French prisoners-of-war
and to modify the conscription of labor
that fearfully drained France of her man-
hood. But, ironically, as victory slipped
from Hitler’s grasp the path of collabora-
ation led ever downward into murkier
depths of cruelty and betrayal. When
thugs like Darnand and Deat became his
colleagues in the Vichy cabinet, even
Laval realised that the game was up. On
D-Day he broadcast an appeal to French-
men not to take up arms on either side.
By then, however, neutrality was as hope-
less as collaboration.
Laval’s post-war fate was certain. He
was the classic scapegoat in the period
when French justice was corroded by
the bitter passions of humiliation and
revenge. His trial was a grisly farce. His

execution was sheer horror. The reader
needs a strong stomach to follow Cole’s
description of the final act when the
prisoner, retching and half-paralysed by
the agony of self-administered cyanide,
was propped up in front of the firing
squad at Fresnes.
This is a well-balanced, competently-
written biography and it may help to
modify some of the grosser misconcep-
tions about Laval’s personality and
motives. But to understand is not neces-
sarily to admire. Laval remains a singu-
larly unlovable figure. Most people who
remember the pre-war European scene
retain the image of a sly, swarthy little
man with a white necktie and a lock of
greasy hair falling over his calculating
eyes—the ex-Socialist lawyer who jug-
gled his way to power through Right,
Left and Centre, the provincial innkeep-
er’s boy who became seigneurial lord of
the local chateau, the partner in the
Hoare-Laval plan, and, finally, the arch-
intriguer of Vichy. The image is near
enough to the truth, but it is by no means
the whole picture of the man, as Cole's
book convincingly shows.

/A S. Lewis has suggested that it may be
possible to judge books by their
readership: how do people use a given
book? What can they make it? Similarly,
unless one imprisons one’s judgment
wholly in the local scene, it might be
useful to judge Australian works by the
extent to which they demand a place in
the context of English or European litera-
ture as a whole. (The shameful neglect
of Australian literature by critics and
libraries in England may be explained at
Teast partly by the failure of Australian
critics, by and large, to suggest that Aus-
tralian writing has any interest or rele-
vance beyond Australia.)
Taking my life in my hands, I sug-
gest that on such a criterion a clear
difference is visible in stature and interest
among our present four literary cobbers;
Brennan and Furphy have a stature that
can only be properly assessed in terms
of the whole of turn-of-the-century Eng-

weren’t too. To put it another way,
Brennan and Furphy are genuinely of
interest within the larger context; they are
in fact too good and too big as writers
to be confined and isolated in it.
Both James McAuley and John Barnes
do in fact usefully call in a wider than
local reference, the former more notably:
bringing in not only Mallarme and Rim-
baud, but Rossetti, Francis Thompson,
Coventry Patmore, and the early Yeats.
He gives a most helpful account of Bren-
nan’s striking but shifting recurrent
imagery, finding “Lilith” rather than “The
Wanderer” the centre of Brennan’s ach-
ievement; and concluding that Brennan
must be ranked below the four English
poets cited. I think this may be over-
rigorous; Brennan has at his best a po-
tential of genuine grandeur which may
well lift him above, or at least among, the
first three. At any rate it is an invigorat-
ing and proper comparison.
Furphy has suffered badly at the hands
of nationalist advocates. As with Lawson,
the newcomer to Australian literature is
repelled by the calibre of much of the
advocacy for him; to be correspondingly
astonished on actually reading him. John
Barnes’s discussion is very far from hav-
ing such an effect; he gets very deeply
and clear-sightedly in to the problems
of the Furphy-Collins link-up, and makes
good and balanced criticisms on the
structure. He refers for comparisons to
the Naturalists, Lawrence (in “Kan-
garoo”), Shakespearean tragedy, and (el-
liptically) to Twain; here, I feel, he could
with profit have been more comprehen-
sive, detailed and concrete after all,
who else was making comparable experi-
ments in form in 1903? The novelists of
that day were James and Conrad and
then Gissing, and “Mark Rutherford.”
Furphy isn't with the first two, but he
might be with the second; and there
might be most useful direct comparison
with the last-mentioned.
Neither Max Harris nor Ray Mathew
brings in extra-Australian references, and
for good reasons. Max Harris provides
some interesting comments on content
and method, marred by a certain im-
precision Slessor -is continually re-
ferred to as a “major poet,” but we are
not told in what sense. He isn’t put for-
ward as a Shakespeare: then as what?
Ray Mathew saves Miles Franklin as the
author of “My Brilliant Career” and “My
Career Goes Bung,” and as Brent of
Bin Bin; resigning, happily, any large
claim for “All That Swagger.” His ad-
vocacy indeed resembles Vincent Buck-
ley’s for H. H. Richardson; here further
reference might well come in they
stand apart perhaps from all other
women writers in English of their time.

Thunder-Claps
No! In Thunder. Essays on Myth and
Literature. Leslie A. Fiedler. Eyre
& Spottiswoode. 375. 3d.
T>y Fiedler’s criterion, the moral com-
mitment of the artist, and the writer
in particular, to his art, demands con-
tinual criticism and re-assessment of all
established truths.
Predictably, the ethos of the best-seller
is demolished early in his book. Fiedler
finds the success of “literature of the
market-place” due to its shielding readers
from unpalatable “truths,” reassuring
them with pseudo-myths to allow them
to enjoy vicariously what life has denied.
Therefore, the artist who achieves ac-
claim in his lifetime has compromised
“With his art.
Included with such literary phonies is
the “social protest” writer, bravely de-
fending oppressed minorities with one
eye on the lucrative middlebrow market.
And in response to book jackets which
cry their contents to be “committed to
affirmation, or love, or a belief in the
dignity of man,” Fiedler grabs his wallet
and runs. So much for Steinbeck, Miller
(Arthur, not Henry, of course) and their
sort.
Even in the wake of such resounding
introductory thunderclaps, the other
essays prove not at all anti-climatic. The
first section is devoted to the mythic
significance of writers as diverse as
Shakespeare, Kafka, Robert Penn War-
ren and Cesare Pavese. In the context of
these, astutely penetrating appraisals, the
author’s translation of Dante's “A 1 poco
giorno,” illustrating a fascinating dis-
sertation on the elegant sestina form,
provides an unexpected pleasure.
Myth theory is utilised in the second
group of essays to illuminate social as-
pects of the last four decades in the
United States, although not as exhaus-
tively as the book jacket suggests. The
unfortunate authors of two scholarly
works on the ’twenties and ’thirties re-
spectively are made to feel the jabs of
Fiedler’s pen.
The recent wave of interest in the
Leopold-Loeb case is convincingly put
forward as an illustration of the essential
difference between the class-conscious
’Thirties and the liberal ’Fifties. Equally
sharp is the contrast revealed between
America’s “Un-Angry” contemporary
writers, presented as having been robbed
by the Affluent Society of their right to
significant protest, and Britain’s
“Angries,” whose declassing of experi-
ence constituted a long overdue reaction
against the tyranny of “an imperious
ideal of good writing . . . which (gave)
so odd a uniformity to English fiction.”
Although one cannot help feeling that
Fiedler over-manipulates the American
scene to suit his thesis (the “Beats,” for
example, are virtually dismissed) his as-
sessment of Amis and Co., surely the
most over-worked whipping-boys of re-
cent years, is often fresh and astute, if
somewhat indulgent.
The book’s third section, “The Ex-
cluded,” contains an attempted explana-
tion of racial attitudes in America of
Jew, Negro and white Gentile, analysed
in basically mythic terms, avoiding the
cliches of the liberal ethos, plus a five-
part essay on the changing role of the
child in Western literature. This latter
subject, a favorite target of the anti-
sentimental Fiedler, was discussed at
length with somewhat different emphases
in his earlier “Love and Death in the
American Novel”. Every famous literary
juvenile from Tiny Tim to Holden Caul-
field is vigorously shaken up in this
consciously outrageous account of the
effects of Romanticism’s replacement of
the concept of Original Sin with that of
Original Innocence. The blonde goddess
of nursery and orphanage is Fiedler’s
favorite target: “in this single figure are
satisfied the middle-class desire to idealise
womanhood; the Protestant resolve to
celebrate pre-marital chastity; the North
American wish to glorify the fair and
debase the black; as well as the senti-
mental need to deliver childhood from
the odor of diapers and the implications
of Original Sin.”

dust jacket of “A Free Agent”
labels its narrator a “tough, clever
and determined man.” This seems remote
from the facts. He is no relative of
James Bond, Lanny Budd, Robert Jordan
or any other American-style superhero.
He’s another Man From Missouri trying
to do his American best in a wide and
dangerous world, where the Cold War
is fought in the human mind and a state-
ment in Madrid can be the death of him
in Central Africa and a spear against
his country in the UN.
It's also a world in which a Missouri
man can be saved from death by a
tribal Negro who first shows him, over
the top of a chiefs art collection
bits of people mounted on a shield
a look “of the kind we give to all the
world’s hopeless bastards, the pathetic
cases, the blind, the lame, the freaks,
the starving kids and the soon-to-die . . .


this big, black, ugly guy stared at me,
sort of sharing my troubles the only way
he could.” An American reporting from
Africa today, perhaps an Australian from
Papua tomorrow.
Wakeman’s “A Free Agent” begins
close to us, when its fictional narrator
makes a wartime forced landing in the
Solomons and carries, his gunner through
jungle and swamp on his back, not as
a hero but as a human being, often
wishing his burden would kick off, scared
cold much of the time, self analytical in
his lucid moments.
Through that long chapter, and
another about his folks when he goes
home, we see how he ticks. In what
amounts to a second book, it’s ten years
later and he’s travelling out of Athens for
an aircraft corporation, meets an intel-
ligent Cretan women, learns much about
Greece, Greek ethos and Greek poverty,
and blithely ignores his Zoe’s political
past in a way that no “tough, clever and
determined” American would have.
Book Three takes him away from her,
ostensibly on a business circuit of Africa
which he begins with a flight to London,
an incognito visit to his natural mother,
a flight to San Lrancisco for a briefing
in his undercover work, a stopover to
see his adoptive mother, and a night in
Madrid with Zoe, when he grumbles
about the world in a room the Reds
have wired for sound. Then to Africa and
the second half of the book, which is a
fair lesson in Cold War intrigue, geo-
politics and sudden death, through the
mind of a Missouri car salesman turned
fighter-bomber pilot turned international
commercial traveller and undercover
man.
So it is a very modern novel, import-
ant for several reasons, including the fact
that more people are living, loving and
dying as they fly from country to country
but few other serious novelists have
caught up with them. “A Free Agent”
is important as a counter-view to both the
Fleming and Greene presentations of
foreign intrigue. It almost fulfils Ed-
mund Wilson’s idea that Raymond
Chandler’s use of the language could be
taken beyond the private-eye story. And
it depicts political Americans who are
not so far from the Jeffersonian ideal
which is generally regarded as mere win-
dow-dressing by the cynics, espresso
bravos, and all the other uncommitted or
disengaged. Among whom we find the
narrator of “A Free Agent” at the end,
waiting and hoping for his Zoe to return,
while he rebuilds a disused cottage in
Greece and grows hydrangeas (“unlike
what’s-his-name I have no cabbages to
cultivate”).
On Leo Walmsley’s experience, this
is no way to get your wife back. His
disengagement from the world occurred
during the Depression, when he and his
young wife went to live in an old army
hut on the Cornish coast. He wrote a
best seller, “Love in the Sun,” about that
adventure. During the war they farmed
other places and Leo wrote a sequel
called “Happy Ending.” Then his wife
took their five children, including an
unborn one, and went off to give them all
the things that Leo considered unimport-
ant, such as religion, formal education,
and the right friends.
He spent the next few years restoring
the old army hut in Cornwall, with the
help of local craftsmen.
In the winters he fished, farmed, wrote,
danced with his cat to gramophone music,
tried to teach himself tap-dancing, and
waited for summer to come round again.
Luckily, in the end, a young repertory
actress named Stephanie (Nathaniel Gub-
bins’ daughter) came with it, and Leo
remarried and had another daughter.
All of it is thoroughly British, charming
and disarming, a quiet retreat from the
Cold War and overheated civilisation,
a reminder that life goes on, in good
traditional ways, in some untouched
places.
If there is a reason for the publication
of David Walker’s Satevepost stories
in hard covers, that may be it, too.
Simple people do simple, human things
in various parts of the world, mostly
yesterday or the day before. Little
Georgie and Jean poach the giant trout
of the Reekie, and its joint owners catch
them and smile, reminded of their own
youth. A District Commissh in Old India
sees his wife dallying with a young man
while he’s waiting to shoot a panther, and
wounds one marauder, kills the other.
Three retired admirals fight a naval
action, sailboat versus power boats, on
a Canadian lake. Good yarns for readers
to take up and put down. A more savage
reviewer would add ... in the bookshop.

'C'rom the Publishing House of Charles
-*■ E. Tuttle come two fine silk-bound
books, “Cha-No-Yu” and “Painted Fans
of Japan.” The latter is a fan-shaped
gem whose author, Rieko Chiba, writes
a charming introduction together with a
short history on the fan in Japan. It is
a fascinating story: fans for quickening
the burning of charcoal, folding fans that
in bygone days were used as road maps,
umbrellas, even daggers Miss Chiba
delicately begs to be excused for in-
cluding appropriate poems alongside the
Noh masterpieces reproduced for our
pleasure and also hopes that the anony-
mity of the artists will not take away
from our enjoyment. The scarlet-and-gold
brocade book has a jewel-like charm
and would be a proud possession in any
collection of unusual books.
For well over four centuries there has
existed in Japan a very definite point of
view or way of life associated with Cha-
No-Yu (literally, The Way of Tea), and
the reappearance of Professor Sadler’s
book will enthrall those of the Occident
who have already discovered the fascina-
tion of Japan's cultural life as well as
those who have yet to be initiated into
that engaging world.
The author, with admirable restraint,
presents a beautifully uncluttered picture
of a land he understands and obviously
has a great affection for, and one feels
that the publishers also have put heart
as w'ell as technique into their presenta-
tion of the book, helping to make it a
rare classic in its field. Faithfully and
comprehensively, Professor Sadler depicts
the social phenomenon of Teaism as a
blending into one potent whole of
idealism and materialism that has in no
way faded through startling historical
changes and foreign absorption, but has
become what may well be described as a
sacrament of economics, etiquette and
aesthetics.
Perhaps at first glance the book ap-
pears to be rather a technical work, but
this is not so. Pungent tales and anecdotes
give exciting glimpses into the minds of
Japan’s average man and woman, show-
ing that the influences of Teaism have
penetrated deeply in the everyday life of
the community; explaining the disciplined
aestheticism as expressed in the archi-
tecture, garden design and all other forms
of art, as well as greatly affecting the
behavior and thinking of business prin-
ciples. So much so, that Mr Smith can
never truly hope to comprehend the
mind of Susuki San without at first
knowing at least something of the philo-
sophy of Tea.
Nina Epton of “Love and the French”
fame has written a funny, rather fabulous
book on present-day Japan. With un-
usual courage (and charm) she travels
the length and breadth of the land, at-
tempting to discover for herself and
for us what the Japanese are like
today, seventeen years after the war and
Hiroshima. She meets priests, and a
young man who wishes her to enlighten
him on the sexual habits of the English.
She meets business men and farmers’
wives. She lives in a humble room above
a barber’s shop and in a Buddhist temple.
She actually does eat seaweed for break-
fast and becomes a devotee of raw fish
for lunch.
Her sharp assessments of conditions
and places are vivid and absolutely right.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
How Fine Can You Pare Interest Rates?
The ready response to the Commonwealth Treasurer’s
second loan for this financial year confirms what every-
one expected, because it is widely known that there is a surplus
of cash in the public’s hands, notably the big institutions.
So this much was expected. The Treasurer, Mr Holt, raised
£69.3m. from his latest loan, with an over-subscription of
£9.3m. Together with the £74.5m. raised in July, plus £15.1m.
proceeds from special bonds and some overseas borrowing,
Mr Holt has obtained £lB4m. of his tentative “£3oom. plus”
target for 1963-64. Even tax refund cheques these days are
accompanied with pleas to invest in special bonds.
But what of the remaining six months of 1963-64? The
Treasury has managed to bring bond rate down to 4i p.c. and,
with production figures rising and unemployment falling, looks
as if it is sitting in the box seat. It’s all over bar the shouting.
That is a most satisfactory position for any Treasurer. Yet
there are one or two facts which should not be overlooked.
The big institutions such as the life offices, forced to comply
with the 30-20 ratio of subscription to Government securities
if they want to retain tax con-
cessions, made hefty advance
subscriptions to Government
loans in 1962-63 and early this
financial year. They could see
quite plainly the trend of in-
terest rates and in several cases
they wanted to subscribe more
than their quota while interest
rates were as high as they were.
With interest rates down to
4i p.c., naturally they now must
assess their over-all return on
investments. Another item to
consider is the increased de-
fence commitments of the Com-
monwealth Government and
the fact that overseas loans
will be very expensive if raised
in the USA.
Mr Holt expressed unusual
concern over J. F. K.’s pro-
posed 15 p.c. Interest Equalisa-
tion Tax. Some say the legis-
lation may not be passed by
Congress. Regardless of this
the proposal already has had
the effect of restricting loans.
Therefore to some extent, the
easy loan raising now may be
behind the Commonwealth Government ... at least at the
pared rates of interest now applying. The institutions and
staff-pension funds must comply with their 30-20 ratio and
this will supply a hard core of loan raisings. But there will be

many others who will be doing some keen figuring to see
where they can get that extra margin after allowing for the
2s. in the £1 income tax concession on bond interest.
If, as has been suggested, the Reserve Bank next year will
need to restrain the excess liquidity, interest rates could rise
again.
Gold Seems Hard
to Resist
Jf President Kennedy’s 250 million dollar wheat deal with
the Soviet bloc is completed without hitch, American
businessmen will expect a liberalisation of trade with countries
behind the Iron Curtain. Perhaps that remark should be quali-
fied by saying “some” American businessmen, because already
there is acute indignation at selling US wheat surpluses to the
Commies.
On the other hand, hard-headed American businessmen
claim they are losing out on
markets while their allies do a
convenient back flip.
Under US legislation which
controls exports to Communist
countries, a rigid licensing sys-
tem is imposed. For example,
exports to China come under the
heading of trading with the
enemy, because the “Korean
emergency” still exists. Under
the Exports Control Act and the
Mutual Defence Assistance Act,
strategic materials are prohibi-
ted from export. NATO, through
its strategic controls committee,
supervises the list of prohibited
exports.
This controls committee
(COCOM) list applies to other
members of NATO, but its
members have shown a liberal
interpretation in their exports
to the Soviet area and Eastern
European countries.
American exporters, by con-
trast, must prove that their ex-
ports will not contribute to the
economic potential of any Com-
munist country. Supervision is
strict and severe penalties are imposed on any US exporter if it
is discovered that the exports are against administrative policy.
America in recent years sent exports to Poland and Yugo-
slavia, but Congress clamped down on this in 1962. US exports


to Communist countries have fallen steadily since 1960 but the
latest deal to send 250 million dollars worth of wheat (in-
fluenced by Russia’s willingness to pay cash) will be equal to
the combined exports of all US commodities to Communist
countries in 1961 and 1962.
It is hard to see what America could buy from Russia : f
trading conditions were liberalised. The only items which the
US seems to need from Russia are gold and Russian ballet
dancers. Meanwhile, it is unlikely there will be any relaxation
of restrictions on trade with China and Cuba.
The thaw in trade relations provides an interesting sidelight
in the cold war over Berlin's status in East Germany. West
Germany is being asked to ship up to 400,000 tons of flour
to Russia. Some political groups believe this is an opportunity
to bargain with Russia on Berlin. On past experience, however,
this cannot be regarded as anything more than a wheat straw
in a cold wind.
A Refinement from
the Auditors
Tn recent discussions on auditing practices the question of
several different auditors being employed at various stages
of producing consolidated accounts has been frequently
ventilated. The situation chiefly arises when, for historical
or other reasons, separate
firms audit subsidiary and
holding companies.
For the last two years Fuller
King and Co. have conveyed
some indication of the rela-
tive distribution of the audits
by an interesting addition to
their report on Melbourne
chemist and essence maker
Alfred Lawrence Holdings.
The relevant paragraph for
1962-63 reads: “We have also
examined the consolidated
balance sheet . . . and the
consolidated statement of
profit and loss ... in con-
junction with the separate
balance' sheets and statements
of profit and loss of the indi-
vidual companies, certain of
which (representing 28 p.c. of
total net assets ) were reported
upon by other auditors.”
That italicised phrase i$ a
useful bit of information for shareholders.
It will be recalled that Fuller, King did the Reid Murray
Holdings audit and “of the 218 subsidiary companies, 185
were reported upon by other auditors.”
Overseas Reserves Versus
Imports and Defence
llfiTH Australia’s overseas reserves above the £6oom. mark
... highest level for 12 years . . . overseas observers
are commenting on Australia’s prosperity.
The London “Times” recently was complimentary in its
remarks and suggested that the current prosperity seemed
likely to be maintained during the current year. It also
stated that the level of spending was likely to benefit from
the increasing extent of the current round of salary and
wage increases.
USA’s Exports to Communist Area
Unfortunately, some of that spending will be outlayed on
imports, including essential raw materials as well as less
essential items. Commodity prices for Australia’s exports
will be under some strain to maintain the overseas reserves
in the face of increased spending on imports, not forgetting
that Australia’s Defence commitments could make a decent
dent in the reserves when paying for new aircraft, etc.
Doubtless this was in Treasurer Holt’s mind when he exa-
mined the overseas money markets on his recent trip abroad.
Striking the Balance on
Restrictive Practices
Opeaking in Melbourne at the annual meeting of the
lnstitute of Public Affairs last week the president,
Mr F. E. Lampe, said that “whatever the merits of restrictive
practices legislation in principle, one cannot help reflecting
that the possibility of its introduction has come at a
singularly inopportune time in Australia’s economic develop-
ment. The Commonwealth Government itself would be the
first to acknowledge that Australia has achieved miracles of
growth and progress in the last 20 years and there is no sign
that our development is slowing down. Indeed, the greatest
days are probably still ahead.
“All this great achievement
and these wonderful prospects
have come about without legis-
lation of the kind now in view.
It would be hard, then, to
justify its introduction on the
grounds of urgent economic
need. Indeed, it is possible to
argue that it would be better
to leave well alone and not
embark on a piece of legisla-
tion which must, in its initial
stages anyway, cause uncer-
tainty and doubts, extend the
ambit of Government con-
trol in industry, distract the
minds of business leaders
from the all-important tasks
of industrial expansion, and
generally give rise to quite a
deal of confusion in business
circles.”
This is not to say that there
are no business practices in
Australia that are against the
public interest generally, or not unfair to some individuals or
businesses in particular, Mr Lampe said.
On the subject of overseas capital Mr Lampe said we
should think very hard before taking action that could
conceivably injure the flow of capital we are now receiving.
“We cannot do without it simply because as a small
community we cannot regenerate enough capital from our
own resources. That certain disadvantages and risks are
attached to investment of this kind, there can be no question,
but, as with the proposal to legislate on restrictive practices,
it is a matter of where the balance of advantage lies.
“We should move very warily before we attempt to tamper
in any way with the flow of investment from abroad. It
may be that if we want the most productive forms of invest-
ment, we may have to accept those forms that are less
advantageous or even have positive disadvantages. We may
not be able to pick and choose as much as we would like
to do.”


Erhard Takes Over with
Positive Viewpoint
VTo one really believes that Dr Konrad Adenauer, having
at last stepped down from the West German Chancellor-
ship, can contain himself mutely on the fringes of politics,
gently proffering sage advice to an untried successor. The
firmness of his views, on all subjects from the Atlantic Alliance
to dealings with Russia, are too well known to promise
complete retirement.
Indeed Dr Adenauer’s light-hearted assertion in the Bundes-
tag that he would henceforth become a “a good listener and
an infrequent talker” has been greeted with sceptical amuse-
ment. He has also done little to hide a profound disapproval
of the new Chancellor, Dr Ludwig Erhard.
Yet it seems all too easy to conclude from these posturings
that Dr Erhard must remain abashed before the shadow of
“the greatest German since Bismarck” or that his flexible and
easier approach means a kind of political weakness.
After all it has been Economics Minister Erhard who
initiated, guided and stimulated the tremendous postwar
upsurge of his country’s economy, which is still, despite
emerging cost strains, the strongest in Europe. A performance
like this leaves a man with a vast residue of prestige and
surely also with a keen sense of the methods of political
accomplishment.
There does not appear any reason to assume from the
relatively innocuous tone of Erhard’s acceptance address
“My policy is a policy of the middle way” that his approach
to the major issues of our time is feeble or lacks authority.
Plenty of evidence exists to suggest the reverse, even if the
ways of exercising this authority may look very different from
the rigid and basically autocratic Adenauer. The acceptance
speech itself made quite clear Germany’s desire to press
closer to Britain and other European States than the de Gaulle-
Adenauer concepts have up till now allowed.
If these kind of ideas do direct the new Chancellor’s
behavior, they can plainly be seen to be a continuation of
beliefs earlier and frequently expressed. Dr Erhard is a
voluminous speaker and author. His latest collection of talks
and essays, assembled under the title “The Economics of
Success,” certainly present viewpoints long and vigorously held.
It will be remembered that Erhard was President of the
Council of Ministers of the European Economic Community
when Britain applied to join the Common Market. He did
not then hedge, nor has he since changed, his support.
The Community, he maintained, “is unthinkable without the
participation of a country like Great Britain, to whom Europe
owes so much in all spheres of national and personal life.
The fact that we can record this measure of agreement in
our political, economic and cultural aims gives us the necessary
basis, and should be a guarantee, for the success of our
common efforts. I do not deny, of course, that there are
considerable obstacles to be overcome. . . .”
On the same occasion Erhard stated, and again has never
withdrawn, a lively sense of linkage with the Atlantic com-
munity, far removed from Adenauer’s “French” misgivings.
Perhaps one of Erhard’s keenest present problems is to resolve
the real differences between the “American” and “French”
sections now obvious in Germany.
But he will still regard the EEC as a necessary step towards
an “Atlantic solution,” with Britain as a required partner in
the process. Whatever the lulls are at this moment, Australia
will in the future have to face the pull of Britain towards
Europe.
Dr Erhard hardly puts his notions forward cautiously or
with concealment: “I take the view that one must strike out
boldly if one wants to achieve anything really decisive.”
There is something appealing and fruitful about such
technique. “In my varied experience as Minister for Economics
I have learned that, for example, it is very much easier
politically to reduce all trade and industrial tariffs by 45 p.c.
in a two-stage operation than it is to reduce tariffs on
five commodities by 5 p.c. ... It means that one can appeal
to nations and people on big things.”
The world will wait to see more examples of Dr Erhard’s
bigness.
British Economy Rides High
to Ignore “Crises”
all accounts the long knives were completely un-
sheathed for the hectic personal battles from which
finally emerged a new British Prime Minister. Compromise
choice or not as Lord Home may turn out to be, his “victory”
scarcely displays any of the excellencies hitherto claimed for
the Conservative Party’s manner of “evolving” its leader.
While it stretches the facts to argue that any deep con-
stitutional crisis occurred, nevertheless a break has taken
place in this century’s traditional doctrine that a Prime
Minister should come straight out of the House of Commons.
This, as much as anything else scandal atmospheres and all
must affect the party’s public image moving towards next
year’s General Election.
The British electorate has also to come to terms with a
freshly refurbished Labor Party, where, apparently, other
personal animosities are in process of being smoothed over
as well.
When the election arrives, however, the average elector,
certainly most British businessmen, could be just as concerned
with the high prosperity of his country’s economy, and wonder-
ing where to spread the credit.
As the article from an English financial writer on page 54
spells out, the British economy is throbbing with an optimism
and drive very rare during the last few years. Not for quite
a while has anyone been tempted to rank Britain’s business
and industrial performance in the “world league”.
None of the latest disturbances have touched off tremors
in the usual indicators of health the stability of sterling
and cheerful Stock Exchange levels, for instance. The
economy almost proceeds on its path oblivious of political
divagations, very much as we have come to expect with
the French.
One commentator has even gone far to suggest that the
Conservative Party’s recent conference displayed a divorce
from what industry is accomplishing which can only confer
a propaganda benefit on Labor.
Assuredly industry appears quite willing to carry on under
its own steam. The most recent inquiry conducted by the
Federation of British Industries shows higher outputs, fewer
complaints of idle capacity and a stronger desire to chase
exports.
Overall productivity is getting close to the target rate fixed
by the National Economic Development Council (Neddy).
What a change it is when the English hope that world
liquidity problems will be solved in time to allow them the
fullest rewards from their new-found expansionism!


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
The Economics of Exporting
A sound economic basis for export action
A ustralian manufactures have made
good progress in the export field in
recent years but despite official export
incentives and excellent insurance facili-
ties provided by EPIC many firms with
potentially good export sellers have
refused to take the plunge, sometimes it
seems from lack of proper appreciation
of the economics of exporting applicable
to the individual firm.
Taking the notional concept of the
typical individual firm in Australia over
the last two years, one would say that
its characteristics included the existence
of surplus capacity, high cost of meeting
competition in the local market and
reluctance to commit itself to new
capital expenditure for future expansion
in face of the limited scope for in-
creasing its share of a relatively slowly
growing market.
It may also be assumed that this
“typical” firm would be catering almost
exclusively for the home market whether
in fact it has explored the possibilities
of exporting or not in answer to the
obvious question of how to increase sales.
To many such firms it must have
seemed that although exporting was the
answer to increasing sales it had to be
ruled out because of the much heavier
cost of selling abroad compared with
selling at home. As net prices obtainable
against world competition in export
markets would, generally speaking, be
lower than those obtainable from home
sales, the advantages to be got from the
increase volume exports would bring
were not high enough to make the
exercise economically worthwhile.
It seems, however, that many such
firms have shrunk too easily from the
mountain of increased selling costs they
would be up for in exporting—such items
as higher transport and travel costs, more
staff, tariffs to meet and special docu-
mentation —without fully considering the
fact that their fixed costs would not rise
anything like in proportion to their
export sales.
In our typical firm exports would
make use of plant-time which would
otherwise not be used, or used less
profitably. Even in the generality of
firms, factory size is influenced by tech-
nical factors, usually allowing a margin
of spare capacity above anticipated
demand for contingencies. Using this
margin makes exports profitable for
existing plant and, with additional or new
manufacturing plant, the added volume
from exports can justify technically pre-
ferable and more efficient size than
could be based on home demand alone.
This point—the real “teeth” of the
economic argument for exporting—can
be illustrated by the recent exercise of a
company whose export sales for 1962-63
were first analysed by applying the same
“standard factory cost” to material
produced for export as for home sales.
On this basis the contribution of the
export side to the company’s profitability
would have been sufficiently small for
the wisdom of export policies to be
questioned. But the capacity used to
make the product for export would other-
wise have been idle.
Therefore the accountants re-analysed
the figures, interpreting the factory cost
of the products exported as only the
extra expense on material and labor
directly involved. On this changed basis
exports contributed to company over-
heads and profits multiplied by ten, and
their true importance stood out.
fpHE same approach can be illustrated
from the practices of other successful
exporters. A few years ago one of these
found itself supplying home demand by
working one shift. The company started
a second shift, with little or no additional
capital investment, and went out for
export sales with the product made at a
very economic marginal cost. Exports
now account for half of the volume and
increased efficiency and automation from
this bigger volume has helped costs in
all markets.
To take another case, a maker of
automotive components found it had
spare factory capacity during the re-
cession so the management studied
export markets, produced the different
types of components required and was
able to re-fill and expand capacity
Export sales now comprise over one-
half of the increased volume and con-
tribute directly to lower unit costs and
a more even flow of production.
The better utilisation of capital plant
and resources is the most direct
economic argument for any firm to
export, but it is by no means the only
argument. Selling in several countries
spreads the impact of local booms and
slumps in demand, and allows more
constant and higher factory loading.
Feedback of knowledge is vitally im-
portant, experience of foreign designs,
technical progress and selling methods
are both stimulating and valuable.
The extension of markets through
exporting, even of a single product-line,
provides a stimulus to company growth
and also the opportunity to grow people
—to give them training and experience
which will increase their competence and
value.
Again there is the “stick” argument
for exports—the economic challenge to
the home market. Overseas markets are
developing rapidly, and unifying, offering
their domestic manufacturers better
opportunities for building up large sales
volumes. In any field in which the Aus-
tralian manufacturer does not go out
now and secure some share of the
growing overseas markets it is likely
that the overseas manufacturers, from
their base of bigger markets and profits,
will expand their sales here.
When all this is said, starting to make
exports directly, rather than through
merchant houses, presents special prob-
lems for the smaller company. The
difficulty is rather one of a very small
number of executives having limited time
than one of restrictions of finance. To
build up exports gradually, starting with
a few agents in favorable territories,
does not incur too much expense for
almost any company, but for the small
company export success is directly re-
lated to someone at the top management
level being personally interested and
involved.
For most companies the initial costs
of establishing sales in an overseas
market will naturally be higher than the
immediate profit, but this is true of any
fresh marketing operation, at home or
abroad. Such initial costs must be
separated from the true recurring
additional expenses of exporting. Part of
the initial cost will often arise from
adapting production to different specifi-
cations based on strange systems.
This hurdle, once overcome, is less
formidable than it first appears but there
is room for the Government to help
exports by ensuring that Australian
standards come more into line with those
used abroad.
If only because of the limits to sales
expansion in the home market, doubtless
more and more Australian firms will
seek to find the answer to the question
of how to increase sales by trying their
fortunes in overseas markets. They can
be reassured that there is a sound
economic basis for taking such action
both to get fuller use of their existing
capacity and to open paths for further
capital investment.
But once committed to an export
programme it is to be hoped that firms
will stick to it even in the face of initial
losses. Nothing is more damaging to a
manufacturer or a country than the “in
and out” exporter who is prepared to
give service in a market only when he
has spare capacity from his permanent
markets.


Britain’s Economic Miracle?
“A great business transformation in the making."
By SAMUEL BRITTAN
(Of the London “Observer”)
TAuring all the months that newspaper
headlines have been bursting with the
Profumo and Cabinet crises, a great
business transformation has been in the
making. In his Mansion House speech
Mr Maudling, if anything, underplayed
its extent. But the signs are there for all
to see.
We seem to be in the middle of the
largest, most spectacular and most suc-
cessful Motor Show ever. The retail
trade, so sluggish until late summer, has
emerged in a blaze of glory; builders
have been extremely busy for some
months now, and industrial production is
zooming. The steel industry, which was
recently the scene of much head-shaking,
is rapidly increasing output.
The £3O million that ICI is pouring in-
to new expansion is among many indica-
tions that industrial investments are on
the turn. Even the aircraft and shipping
industries seem to be perking up; one
is constantly coming across evidence of
rapid expansion in all sorts of unexpected
places, from floor tiling to disc brakes.
The pace of expansion has far exceed-
ed the Treasury’s Budget-time notions.
Yet many people may find their opti-
mism tempered by a feeling that we
have been here before. Was not a simi-
lar boom in 1959 followed by a huge
balance of payments deficit and a long
period of “stop”?
Yet there are crucial differences. The
1959 boom was not accompanied by any
really large surge forward in export vol-
ume, which remained at the 1957 level.
This year, in contrast, exports look like
rising 10 p.c. above the 1961 level and
seem set to rise higher still.
At least half of the credit for what
looks like a British Economic Miracle is
due to the sins of our competitors. For
several years now wage inflation has been
much faster in such countries as Ger-
many, France and Italy than in Britain.
Much of the rest of the credit should
go to a more competitive spirit at home.
Most noticeable in the shops, this has
spread backwards into manufacturing
(and even to exports) and, to a slight
extent, to heavy industry. Throughout
business a vast amount of dead wood has
been sought and chopped out —although
of course, plenty remains.
This is not all due to the Government’s
unpopular squeeze policies of 1961-62,
much though this view will appeal to
financial masochists. Previous profit
squeezes had no such salutary effects.
The crucial factors have been the
growth of brash new firms to challenge
existing ideas, the drive against restric-
tive practices, and above all the threat of
foreign competition. In fact, we gained
many of the economic benefits of the
Common Market from the belief that we
were about to join. This set up a momen-
tum among exporters that even General
de Gaulle has been unable to stop. Some
credit is also due to the last investment
boom, and to Mr Selwyn Lloyd’s wage
pause, difficult though it is to quantify
their effects.
Economic miracles are not in fact very
miraculous. The main ingredients are a
currency that is undervalued—or at least
not overvalued ample consumer pur-
chasing power and a dash of competi-
tion. Germany, France and Italy have
all had their miracles, and now it is
probably Britain’s turn.
The buoyancy of consumer and busi-
ness spending when so many commenta-
tors feared it would be hit by “political
uncertainty” should be an object lesson
for future policy. Meanwhile, there will
be a frantic race between the two politi-
cal parties to reap the benefits of the new
economic atmosphere.
Out, sceptics will ask, can the boom
really go on without overstraining the
economy?
Britain must be one of the very few
countries in the world where the reaction
to good economic news is an instinctive
move of the hand towards the brake.
The time for braking has not yet arrived.
Despite its recent expansion, industrial
production is still below the National
Economic Development Council’s target.
Production is unlikely to go on rising
at quite the hectic pace of the last three
months, which must owe something to a
turn-round in stocks. As a result of
their efficiency drives, most firms can
now increase output without taking on
much extra labor.
The employed population of the coun-
try as a whole is still several hundred
thousand below normal, and more people
could certainly be attracted into the
labor force. Expansionary influences
are, however, now strong enough for
monetary policy to move into neutral
gear. And the financial authorities should
soon start thinking furiously of a good
weapon to prevent a stock-piling boom
from bursting on us in 1964, when a
re-equipment boom will almost certainly
be getting under way.
What else could go wrong? The main
bottlenecks are familiar enough: short-
ages of skilled labor, the north-south
imbalance, the housing shortage which
makes labor movements difficult, inade-
quate redundancy arrangements and —-
connected with all these others the
wage-cost spiral.
Our new Prime Minister should pull
together piece-meal efforts now being
made to tackle these problems, either by
putting Neddy right at the centre of the
picture or by creating an effective plan-
ning machinery inside the Government.
My own view is that, despite an occa-
sional nasty jolt, we shall manage intern-
ally; the only thing that might really spoil
our miracle is a world-wide economic
setback. There is a small chance of a big
international monetary breakdown, and
a moderate chance of a less dramatic
slow-down in world trade arising from
weakness in the present payments mecha-
nism.
But, keeping our fingers crossed
against these wider threats, there is no
reason why Britain should continue be-
hind in the world league. Indeed we are
now beginning to move up in position.
O.F.N.S.
High-flying Containers
\ ir freighting is becoming so specia-
lised that the latest development by
Pan American is to employ container
specialists to advise shippers, cargo
agents and other cargo sales personnel
on the right type of container.
Each is responsible for keeping cur-
rent on developments in the container
field and on actions of the newly-
created Containers Board of the Interna-
tional Air Transport Association.
Container specialists have at their
disposal detailed knowledge on various
containers manufactured throughout the
USA and can put a distributor in touch
with the right firm to design and create
the most efficient container for a speci-
fic product.
The specialists also work closely with
container manufacturers by reviewing
new products and advising on specifica-
tions for shipment by air and require-
ment for lATA approval.
Beef Trade Bullish
of beef by world traders
jumped 30 p.c. in 1962, with USA
taking 780,000 tons, thus accounting for
nearly half the increase.
Australia and New Zealand supplied
about 40 p.c. of the US imports.
Britain also bought 14 p.c. more beef
in 1962, but Argentina and Mexico were
the major sources of Britain’s extra
purchases.


Trade Blocs and Common Markets
A review of two recent books
By J. C. HORSFALL
VUe have never been told precisely how
** near the Six got to agreeing with
Britain on its terms of entry into their
community or to what extent the inter-
ests of Commonwealth countries were
accommodated in such terms. All we
know is that when de Gaulle stepped in
to prevent Britain’s entry the British Gov-
ernment said that almost complete agree-
ment had been reached on economic
terms, which made the political impasse
the more regrettable, especially after such
protracted and difficult negotiations.
With the United States pressing Bri-
tain so hard to get into the Common
Market it would be surprising, even con-
sidering the former’s steps to arrange
mutual tariff concessions through the
medium of its Trade Expansion Act, 1962,
if the almost agreed terms for Britain’s
entry allowed for any formal accommo-
dation of Commonwealth trade interests
after the transition period.
According to Sidney Dell in his study
“Trade Blocs and Common Markets”
(Constable, 375. 3d.), undertaken on a
Ford Foundation grant while on leave
from the United States: “If the United
States is not ready to agree to a loose
trading arrangement of Western Euro-
pean countries only, it would obviously
not consent to something even less
acceptable from its own point of view
namely an arrangement of the same sort
to include the whole Commonwealth . . .
Why, for example, should the United
States consent to an arrangement where-
by Canadian shipments of wheat to
Western Europe would receive preferen-
tial treatment (which they have not done
hitherto, even in Britain) while the US
shipments did not?”
This has always seemed. to be the
great stumbling block to full accommoda-
tion of Commonwealth trade interests in
the even of Britain joining the Six.
America has been consistently adamant
to defeat such blatant discrimination
against its exports. It would be no less
determined today when it is even more
preoccupied with galvanising its balance
of payments and stopping the outflow of
gold than it was during Britain’s ne-
gotiations with the Six.
Dell seems to be right in this inter-
pretation of America’s concern to stop
EEC opening the door to Common-
wealth trade, but it is obvious the US
Administration differs from his views on
the benefits to be had from tariff bargains
it will try to negotiate with the Six under
the Trade Expansion Act.
Arguing that in any negotiations
between equals if one side offers nothing
it will get nothing, any concessions by the
EEC that would be likely to open up
substantial European markets to US
exports would be granted only in ex-
change for concessions of equal merit
in the home market of the US, which
would require a willingness of US
industry to adjust to rising imports of
many products from the community.
Nor does Dell see any real point in
negotiating such mutual trade conces-
sions. For one thing he contends that the
internal markets of both the US and the
EEC are so large that neither stands
to gain any very great economic advan-
tage from a lowering of mutual barriers
to trade. Whatever doubts there may be
as to the adequacy of market size in the
smaller European countries, there can
surely be no doubt, he says, that Western
Europe and the United States are each
sufficiently large to be able to realise
within their own borders all the
economies of mass production and
specialisation.
While the book roves widely into
the whys, wherefors and goals of the
EEC, its internal problems and con-
tradictions, by far the most interesting
discussion revolves around the relation-
ships of the EEC and other big West-
ern industrial countries with the under-
developed countries and the pressures in
these relationships which are driving the
latter to form trade blocs and common
markets —both as defensive measures and
as the most suitable means to further
regional development in the under-
developed areas.
One cannot doubt that a large majority
of the underdeveloped countries believe,
whether rightly or wrongly, that the
Treaty of Rome constitutes an attack
upon them and that this belief is an im-
portant factor pushing them to create
common fronts of their own.
As the President of Uruguay put it
during his opening address to a con-
ference of Latin-American Common
Market countries in July, 1961: “The
formation of a European Common
Market and EFTA constitutes a state
of near-war against Latin-American
exports. Therefore, we must reply to one
integration with another one, to one
increase of acquisitive power by internal
enrichment by another and to inter-
European co-operation by inter-Latin-
American co-operation.”
In taking the lid off so much humbug
heard from the developed countries on
the beneficence of their economic deal-
ings with the underdeveloped areas, Dell
will at last delight the many people here
suspicious of neo-colonialism. He will
also enlighten general overseas thinking
on the realities of world economic re-
lationships as seen outside the developed
countries, though the latter have other
apostles too.
The stark inequality between developed
and underdeveloped countries has been
one of the main themes of the literary
songs of Hungarian-born Thomas Balogh
in economic and political journals for a
generation. He at least is under no
illusions about the realities and his
collected essays, “Unequal Partners”
(Basil Blackwell, 2 vols, each 575. 6d.),
reveal a depth of thinking which has
made him an accepted authority through-
out the world on this and many other
problems of world economic relation-
ships over the years.
However “Unequal Partners” is essen-
tially for the economics specialist. The
general reader will find himself much
more at home with Dell.
“Unequal Partners” has two recurrent
themes, one a theoretical analysis depict-
ing the irrelevance of static models to a
world economy which is subject to con-
tinual and often violent change, the other
a monetary analysis, demonstrating the
appalling similarity between the Central
European payments crisis of 1930 which
Balogh witnessed at first hand from
Budapest and the international liquidity
problem of 1961.
Animating the whole is the author’s re-
cognition that the world economy is not
composed of “a large number of small
and similar countries”, but of a set of
very unequal partners whose differences
in technical and economic development
are closely related to national boundaries.
In industrialised countries large-scale
units are predominant and prices are
“administered,” while in the rest of the
world primitive agriculture and handi-
craft remain predominant with some
enclaves of modern enterprise.
In analysing problems pertaining to
international economic relations, the
details of the particular situation, the
character of the countries concerned, the
historical context, the general monetary
position, form the essential basis for any
prediction of probabilities.
The books are arranged in two
volumes—one theoretical and one with
applications. The second volume will be
an important source for those who wish
to acquire a sense not only of the con-
tinuity of economic problems but also
of the characteristic flavor of the 1940 s
and 19505. One of the author’s strongest
views is that economic theory cannot
profitably be divorced from economic
fact, and the practising economist, young
or old, will appreciate the intelligent
admixture of theory and practice.


“CROESUS”
Mr McEwen’s Gift Horse
“Gentlemanly to the point of being uncommercial"
Always a bit of a Jonah on the
score of world prices for foodstuffs
and raw materials, the Minister for
Trade, Mr J. McEwen, is obviously
reluctant to see the present all-round rise
as a whale of opportunity to put overseas
consumers on the spot.
In the case of the present butter and
cheese shortage in Britain and Europe,
which has sent Britain, at least, scurry-
ing off to the United States to find
adequate supplies of butter, his pat on the
back for the Australian dairying industry
for not exploiting the situation is, to say
the least, gentlemanly to the point of
being uncommercial.
Indeed it looks positively inept con-
sidering that this time last year Britain
was happily prepared to scrap its free
entry arrangements for Australian and
New Zealand butter and cheese in its
desire to get into the Common Market.
If Mr McEwen or anyone else in Aus-
tralia thinks that when the time comes
Britain won’t dice our butter and cheese
makers, they had better think again. If
he thinks that by being gentlemanly now
when a bad season has emptied the butter
churns of Europe is going to help us
when the Common Market is “on” again,
this is pure fantasy.
If the Minister is making any com-
mercial capital with the dairy industry’s
overseas customers out of its forebearing
to raise prices, well and good. But
memories are short in the hard calcula-
tions of Western European countries.
Maybe they would understand us better
if we drove hard bargains in times of
their own scarcities rather than waiting
for us to come cap in hand with our
usual surpluses.
The very least we should be doing is
to be impressing them now with the
argument that there are benefits to be
gained both by European consumers and
primary producing countries from long-
term supply agreements, a subject which
was being very widely ventilated by over-
seas Commonwealth countries in their
representations in Europe last year but
has hardly been heard of since Britain
failed to get into the Common Market.
Seldom in recent years has the
climate been more propitious for the
primary producing countries to get
around the table with the big consumers
of their products, for on all sides of the
world commodity scene prices are rising.
Tn some instances this has been because
of exceptional circumstances such as in
wheat, sugar, dairy products and cocoa,
but the movement which has taken the
“Financial Times” index of commodity
prices up by more than 10 p.c. in the
last year is a general one, suggesting
that after a decade of consumer
supremacy producers are coming into
their own again.
Mr McEwen should not look this gift
horse of opportunity too hard in the
mouth lest the movement peter out and
the opportunity for wresting some long-
term advantages from the consuming
countries be lost, as it has so often been
in the past.
He has the two notable examples of
opportunity lost in the situations which
arose out of the two world wars.
A fter the first of these wars the scar-
city of raw materials had become an
international problem of such magnitude
that the League of Nations was obliged
to heed urgent demands for action. But
by the time high sounding resolutions
were passed by the Council of the League
and investigations set in train, world
scarcity changed to surplus with all its
grave consequences first for the primary
producing countries in the early ’thirties
and then for the rest of the world.
In the words of the official publication
of the League: “While the above
enquiries were in progress, the general
situation in regard to raw materials
completely changed, scarcity being re-
placed by glut.”
Then some years after the Second
World War we had the famous Paley
Commission in the United States, whose
report went into 800 pages to explain
and detail the long-term deficiencies in
supplies of raw materials facing the ever-
hungry United States economy.
The following is an example of the
problems seen by the committee: “The
question ‘Has the United States of
America the material means to sustain
its civilization?’ would never have
occurred to the men who brought this
nation into greatness as the twentieth
century dawned. But with the twentieth
century now half gone by, the question
presses and the honest answers are not
glib. . . .
“In area after area the same pattern
seems discernible; soaring demands,
shrinking resources, the consequent
pressure toward rising real costs, the risk
of wartime shortages, the ultimate threat
of an arrest or decline in the standard of
living we cherish and hope to help others
to attain . . .
“The nature of the problem can per-
haps be successfully over-simplified by
saying that the consumption of almost all
materials is expanding at compound rates
and is thus pressing harder and harder
against resources which, whatever else
they may be doing, are not similarly ex-
panding. This materials problem is thus
not the kind of ‘shortage’ problem, local
and transient, which in the past has found
its solution in price changes which have
brought supply and demand back into
balance. The terms of the materials
problem we face today are larger and
more pervasive.”
That statement was made only 11 years
ago and, even with the rise from their
post-war depths seen in commodity prices
over the last year, would seem laughable
today with almost all agricultural and
mineral products in surplus supply and
the United States maintaining quota
restrictions on imports of many of these
commodities so as to safeguard domestic
producers.
The two main errors of the Paley Com-
mission (and it should, in fairness, be said
that the commission’s conclusions were
widely supported at the time) appear to
have been that they overestimated the
rate of growth of the industrial countries,
particularly the United States and Bri-
tain; and that they underestimated the
rate of expansion of raw-material-
producing capacity.
However that may be, the high prices
of primary commodities up to the early
1950 s led to heavy investment in primary
production all over the world. The in-
dustrial countries gave huge subsidies to
their own agricultural producers and
ploughed a tremendous volume of funds
into the development of mineral resources
and tropical agriculture, especially in
Africa and the oil producing countries of
the Middle East. In the event, the ex-
pansion of investment proved excessive.
It would be altogether too optimistic
to suppose that this year’s rise in industrial
production of the big consumers of the
exports of primary producer countries
has permanently eliminated the slack in
world capacity, even of many commodi-
ties and raw materials whose prices have
been rising over the past year. Again,
as was pointed out earlier, in the case
of some such as wheat, sugar and dairy
products, present circumstances of short-
ages have a decidedly temporary flavor.
It is therefore a pity that the primary
producing countries are being lulled into
a false sense of long term security about
their balance of payments and not bring-
ing up the question of securing long term
commodity agreements while they have
the big consuming countries on the wrong
foot.


Mount Isa’s New Ore
A fortunate mine for Australia
TTistory plays a very important part
in the assessment of the fabulous
Mount Isa copper complex—for the
gigantic Mount Isa-Townsville copper
development is still a youngster. The
annual report of the company to hand
this week suggests that the Mount Isa
mine is richer in copper than could ever
have been imagined.
Ore bodies (as yet ungraded) have been
found at depth—ore bodies separate to
those currently being worked. Chair-
man G. R. Fisher, in his usual calm
way, says that “when these new ore
bodies are firmly delineated a substantial
addition to ore reserves will be made”.
The new lode is apparently a big one
—two hundred feet deep at one stage
anyhow—a little less than a mile below
the even-rich surface at Mount Isa
itself. While a lot of work remains to
prove the extent of the bodies they ap-
pear, at this stage, to be immense.
Mount Isa Mines began production of
copper concentrate in earnest in Febru-
ary, 1953 just 10 years ago as a
natural follow-up to a war effort some
10 years beforehand. The Curtin Gov-
ernment, sorely pressed for copper, asked
Mount Isa in 1943 to switch from lead
to copper.
Copper was not the original target of
the miners at Mount Isa, although some
prospectors were playing with small out-
crops of the metal. John Campbell Miles
discovered a rich lead outcrop in 1923
near some of these copper workings and
Mount Isa Mines came into being to
develop that and surrounding lodes.
After a prolonged establishment
period in which the company went into
hock it acquired, mainly as a result
of the heavy burden of debt, the Ameri-
can Smelting & Refining Co. as share-
holders. Today, the American company
remains the major shareholder.
T>roduction of lead-zinc began in 1931
and, by 1937 (14 years after the
Miles discovery), Mount Isa Mines was
earning profits. But it was lead-zinc all
the way. Some copper mineralisation had
been noted in passing but it was second-
ary to the principal lead-zinc ore lode.
Prompted by the Government’s war-
time request, however, the Mount Isa
team went out and looked for copper
in the surrounding district. They found
it in 1942 alongside the lead-ore. And,
the whole plant was switched from lead
to copper for the three remaining years
of the war.
Although in 1946 the main operation
was switched back to lead-zinc again,
copper was to remain a part of the com-
pany’s thinking—and, in fact, came to
dominate the growth of the company.
Still, it was not until 1953 that all was
ready for a combined lead-zinc-copper
operation.
Copper development has accelerated
with new bodies being encountered regu-
larly. An open-cut operation is now well
underway near the mine.
Despite steady extraction of copper
and lead-zinc ores over the last 10 years,
the ore reserves at Isa get larger every
year. The latest accounts, for instance,
reveal that there is proved lead-zinc ore
amounting to 26,000,000 tons still left
in the mineralised area. This is just
16,100,000 tons more than was thought
to be in the lode 10 years ago. Copper
reserves show even a more startling
growth and today at 29,500,000 tons
(without the new ore bodies) are three
times greater than 10 years ago. Of
course, the copper prospect had not
been developed as keenly as lead-zinc
10 years ago.
A nd, this despite the extraction of
nearly 25 million tons of both ores
in the intervening 10 years.. It must be
pretty safe to reckon that, even at the
expanded production rate of 14,400 tons
of ore a day, there is at least 50 years’
life left in the mine.
Not much “wasting asset” here.
The new copper ore bodies have been
discovered during the most dynamic ex-
pansion programme yet undertaken by
the group. An £B3 million concen-
trator (to break the ore down to nearer
the metal) being built and a £4 million
deep shaft being sunk are major factors
in this programme.
The new ore appears to be well below
existing known horizons, below the plan-
ned 3800-foot depth of the new shaft.
The shaft and concentrator (No. 2) will
allow production to be hoisted consider-
ably, to fit into the expansion plans of
the group.
The expansion programme calls for
another £22 million to be spent in the
next three years—£64 million will
have gone into the place (and Towns-
ville) between 1956 and 1966; all fin-
anced from retained earnings. Of
course, the dynamics of the group
would suggest that further enlargement
will be the order of the day after 1966
anyhow. This too, will come from re-
tained profit.
The development at Townsville, where
the company’s subsidiary Copper Refin-
eries Pty. Ltd. refines Mount Isa blister
copper, offers scope for further growth
towards a fully integrated copper indus-
try. Already the company makes some
fabrications there.
The share market values the Mount
Isa operation at <£l7o million with each
of the 95.3 million ss. shares at 365.
This may prove to be too high over
the short haul, especially as it is the
company’s stated policy not to increase
the dividend cheque during the expan-
sion programme. The total dividend,
thus, will stay at £2.38 million —a fairly
paltry figure alongside the market’s
valuation. The Bulletin’s “Security”
felt this with his review last July.
Yet there is an unmistakable yet hard
to pinpoint quality about this stock.
Moreover favorable developments along
the lines of the new ore bodies and the
present high price will quickly be justi-
fied.
On a national basis, Australia is lucky
to have Mount Isa, and fortunate to
have it developed so well. For it is a
miner’s 1 mine; not particularly rich in
itself but huge. It is a lode that re-
quires efficient large scale workings to
be successful.
Blocking Canadian Auto Parts
A recent proposal by the Canadian
Government to assist in promoting
sales of Canadian-made auto parts (to
counter the unfavorable balance of trade
with the USA) stung the US Secretary
of Commerce, Mr Luther Hodges.
He called on Detroit motor men to
oppose the programme (as if they
wouldn’t) and stressed that Canadian
imports would increase unemployment
in the US automobile industry.
The Canadians are still reeling from
the flood of US imports and they are a
little surprised at the sharp reaction by
Mr Hodges. But most US officials these
days are heavily plugging the govern-
ment line to close that stubborn balance
of payments gap.
Win. Adams Attractive
Placement of 125,000 20s. shares in
Melbourne is a progressive step for
the 79 years old engineer and steel mer-
chant, William Adams and Co. Ltd.
This stock is not as a rule, heavily
traded. When listing is achieved in
Melbourne, arbitrage will sharpen in-
terest in the stock. (Directors might also
see the advantages of a subdivision to
ss. units.)
Latest earning rate was a very much
more comfortable 18.1 p.c. Sales for
the first five months of the current year
are up 15.3 p.c., with a substantial in-
crease in profit.
Funds raised by the placement (which
could be around £312,500) are being used
to buy a 53 acre site at Chester Hill, in
Sydney.


New Car Boom Continues
Working off a pent-up demand
The boom in new ear sales has
surprised even those in the trade.
Earlier estimates suggested it may
peter out before the end of the
year. So last week we sent a
BULLETIN reporter to ask Sydney
dealers what they thought.
A rash of new car buying, prompted
by easier finance, new models and
an increase in two-car ownership is
giving some Sydney car dealers the best
business they have had since the 1960
boom.
Both the new and used car market is
“buoyant,” “flourishing,” “exciting.”
Dealers claim they have never had it
so good . . . but they want it better.
They’re complaining that demand out-
strips supply. Even the
arrival from Italy soon of
400 new Fiats will leave the
market panting for more,
says one dealer.
A Holden dealer last week
claimed he had a waiting list
for the new model his
first waiting list since 1947
when Holden was introduced
to the market.
Current new car registra-
tion figures reveal a situation
that many lucky car dealers
have not experienced since
the early post-war bon-
anza ... a demand so great
that makers cannot keep up
with it. A cross-section of
the more than 400 new-car
dealers in Sydney tends to
confirm this.
New motor vehicle regis-
trations in the buoyant Sep-
tember quarter totalled
103,553 —an annual rate of nearly
415,000. Registrations for nine months
to September total nearly 280,000.
Manufacturers expect the year's registra-
tion figures to pass 360,000 —far sur-
passing 1962's total of 323,246.
The sharply rising trend of new car
sales is shown in figures since July.
There were 35,898 new vehicle registra-
tions in July compared with 28,871 for
the same period last year; in August
there were 33,370 (30,498); in Sep-
tember 34,285 (23,494).
Why are people buying so many new
cars? How long will they continue (in
some instances) to buy new cars faster
than they appear in dealers’ showrooms?
The current favorable level of 22\ p.c.
sales tax (compared with the punishing
40 p.c. in the credit squeeze) is not the
only reason.
None of Sydney’s dealers agree on one
answer. Some say more money, some
say more people, some say it’s natural.
Most dealers are pleased, but happiest
of all are the Holden dealers with their
new EH (a series identification some
people say GM-H waited to use until
it fitted the Extra Horsepower engine).
A new model of any car always
attracts attention, particularly Australia’s
own car which now commands about
46 p.c. of the new car market. Even
Ford dealers say the new Holden is
mainly responsible for the huge upsurge
in new car sales. But the happy car
dealers still complain—lack of supply
from the manufacturers cuts them deep.
Holden dealer J. N. Caldwell Pty Ltd
of Crows Nest has a new but starkly
vacant showroom at St. Leonards station
“I’m not opening it until I can get stocks
to put in,” Mr Caldwell said. “I’m
already selling more than I can get at
the main office and it would be rather
extravagant to open the new showroom
only to have the staff tell customers
they'll go on the waiting list. But I
suppose we'll get more than we can
handle shortly when Holden steps up
production.’’
Mr lohn Page, managing director of
Hastings Deering (Ford dealer) finds
business “bright”. “But I wouldn’t say it
was overwhelming. Car sales are fluctu-
ating all the time and this is one of the
times when it has fluctuated well. Look at
the figures. In the week ending August
30, Sydney Metropolitan dealers sold
1536 of all makes of cars and trucks. In
the week ending October 4, they sold
1772. Then in the week ended October
11, they sold 1290. It’s always fluctuating
but I wouldn’t say business was as great
as some experts say it is.”
Ford’s share of the new car and
station wagon market declined from 17.9
p.c. in the first seven months of this
year to 15.6 p.c. in June-August while
Holden’s rose from 44.5 p.c. to 45.9
p.c. according to the Commonwealth
Statistician.
Mr Page says there are still a lot
more new Ford cars being registered. He
puts it down to more readily available
finance: “Anyone having the minimum
deposit is accommodated with no trouble
at all.”
A smaller dealer, Buckle Motors of
William Street, Sydney, which has a
Rootes group franchise, does not find
business so exciting when compared
with “the big boys who give us all the
competition.” But Mr W. R. Lowrie, the
company's managing direc-
tor, agrees there is a tremen-
dous upswing in new car
sales “a natural growth,”
he calls it.
“Short of another recession
we’ll never go back on our
vehicle -to - population ratio
and the population is increas-
ing all the time, so more
people are buying more cars.
Sales will just naturally have
to keep going up. And while
more vehicles are going on to
the roads, more are coming
off obsolescence takes care
of that.
“It the Government leaves
us alone and I know they
have learnt their lesson —•
people will keep on buying
more and more cars,” Mr
Lowrie said.
The Federal Chamber of
Automotive Industries in its 1963 year
book estimates 3.9 p.c. of all vehicles on
register were scrapped. This meant, said
the Chamber, that while 323,264 new
vehicles were registered last year, the
number of vehicles on register was only
201,013 higher than the previous year—
-122,233 were scrapped. This scrappage
rate is only slightly lower than the record
134,531 (or 4.5 p.c. of vehicles-on-
register) which were scrapped in 1961.
Bombardier Motors, which has a Fiat
and Peugeot franchise, is experiencing a
“very, very bad time,” according to the
managing director, Mr R. E. Green. “It’s
all right for the Holden boys. Their
source of supply is close, but we just
can’t get stock.” He, too, says Holden’s
new model is partly responsible for the
increased registrations.

Cheaper
Transportation
OOMPANY management has in
recent times been faced with un-
precedented rising costs relating to
transport ownership. The quest for
cost reductions in this area of com-
merce has been in existence for a long
time, but today, more than ever, the
solution is being looked for by every
organization operating fleets of vehicles.
The unparalleled drop in used-car
values has added to the problems of
business management, as the cost of
replacing their fleets has increased with
each progressive year. The days of sale
prices exceeding book values are now
over, and for this and numerous other
reasons most of Australia’s largest
companies have turned to Leasing.

JACK JOEL
‘Fingers on the pulse . .
Mr Jack M. Joel, director of Kays
Auto-Lease (a unit of Kay Corporation
Limited) stated that his company is
keeping its fingers firmly on the pulse
of overseas vehicle leasing trends and
is constantly endeavouring to improve
on them. His company is the un-
disputed leader in vehicle leasing and
was instrumental in the introduction
of this principle to Australia.
Over 2.000 vehicles
KV® are now operating over
2,000 lease vehicles to many of
Australia’s largest and most progress-
ive companies who have discovered
that leasing is much more economical
than ownership.
“The era of specialisation is with
us,” Mr. Joel added, “ —if you have a
special problem you consult a special-
ist. That is where Kays Auto-Lease
plays its role in the field of vehicle
leasing.”
Kays Auto-Lease can prove beyond
doubt the great savings to be derived
through the introduction of their fully-
maintained national leasing plans. An
obligation-free analysis of your fleet
requirements can be obtained by con-
tacting Kays Leasing Corporation Pty.
Ltd. in Melbourne (33-0431), Sydney
(31-6621), Adelaide (8-6486), Brisbane
(2-5837), and Launceston (2-4894), or
by writing to their Head Office at 18-
30 Mount Alexander Road, Fleming-
ton, Victoria.
But, says Mr Green, the upswing in
registrations will not continue past
November. “Trade always slackens off
around December and picks up in the
New Year. Most people don’t want to
buy around the end of the year because
the car is automatically a year old on
New Year’s Day. So if he hasn’t bought
by December the purchaser will leave it
go until after January 1.”
An opposite opinion was expressed by
a spokesman for John A. Gilbert,
another Holden dealer. He said the new
Holden was selling as fast as it could
and would continue to do so right
through summer. “The more cars there
are on the road, the more we sell —
they’re self advertising.”
Better value for money and a higher
wage earning capacity have contributed
towards the registrations increase says
Mr Keith Dalziel, joint managing
director of Larke Hoskins, BMC dealers.
“In the case of Austin you buy a
helluva lot better car for your money
than you did, say, 10 years ago—even
taking into account the increased sales
tax. I don’t know if the public realises
this but it must have some bearing on the
new car registrations. Ease of purchase
too has helped—there’s no shortage of
finance.”
Mr Dalziel feels new car registrations
will continue to increase “at least until
1970.” By then the number of new cars
being registered each year will be “close
on the 500,000 mark.”
The increase in the number of two
car owners was another factor con-
tributing to the record number of
registrations. Mr Dalziel said a survey,
recently made by Larke Hoskins of car
owners in the Pymble-Turramurra area
of Sydney showed that 3 p.c. did not
own cars, 67 p.c. owned one car, 24 p.c.
owned two cars and 6 p.c. owned three
or more cars.
A similar survey in the Blakehurst
area showed 12 p.c. did not own a car,
59 p.c. owned one car, 22 p.c. owned
two cars and 7 p.c. owned three or
more cars. Cars like the Morris 850 and
Volkswagen were ideal second cars and
many were being purchased for just that
purpose.
Mr Hugh Anderson, managing director
of P. & R. Williams, another BMC
dealer, says the increase has been going
on since the credit squeeze was eased.
Popularity of smaller cars such as the
Morris 850 and the Morris Elite as
second cars had helped the increase. He
estimated new car registration will
continue to expand until Australia’s
population-to-cars ratio nears that of
America where at present there are
three people to every car.
Increased registrations were reflected in
P. & R. Williams’ sales figures which, Mr
Anderson said, had risen to an average
122 new units each month this year,
47 p.c. higher than the average for the
previous 12 months.
Lanock Motors managing director, Mr
Doug Donaldson, says the era of the
second car has caused the upswing. He
said Lanock Motors, with a Volkswagen
franchise, had achieved new and used
car sales 50 p.c. higher than last year.
“A more stable economy and higher
wages have also increased registrations.”
That last sentence seems like a fairly
accurate short summary, plus the fact
that the credit squeeze and higher sales
tax produced a pent-up demand.
Vehicle Production
Less Spectacular
Production figures for motor bodies,
A including station waggons, don’t
show any startling rise in the past three
months to feed the high rate of motor
vehicle registrations.
But it is a fact that, despite the boom
in car registrations, output of motor
bodies for each of the three months to
September has been virtually steady at
26,700, 26,900 and 26,900.
Even when compared with the corre-
sponding three months of 1962, produc-
tion of motor bodies was fairly steady,
except for a strong lift in the month of
July. Comparative figures for 1962 are
22,900 in July, 27,400 in August and
26,300 in September.
Production statistics for motor vehicle
chassis, including commercial vehicles,
also confirm a virtually steady trend
in the past three months. In fact, chassis
output has dropped from 32,000 in July
1963 to 31,300 in August and 31,000 in
September.
By contrast, there was more of a
rising trend in 1962 of 27,600 in July,
31,200 in August and 29,200 in Septem-
ber.
Holden registrations for September
of 8,215 cars, 4,630 station waggons
and 1,885 utilities give a monthly total
of 14,730 vehicles or an annual rate of
176,760 per annum. This annual rate
matches the annual production target
planned by the company in March
1963, when it embarked on a £33m.
expansion programme scheduled to be
completed in three years.
Holden annual production figures,
taken from the company’s annual report,
are as follows:
1953 44,201 vehicles
1954 54,793
1955 63,908
1956 68,883
1957 95,147
1958 110,241
1959 116,348
1960 139,619
1961 112,377
1962 133,274


BHP Shareholders Deserve
A Better Deal
Considerable Scope For Larger Dividends
By ROGER RANDERSON
Tncreased interest in the shares of the
Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd
as an investment seems immediately jus-
tified by the prospect of an improvement
in recent low dividends. While a very
liquid position puts off the necessity for
an early capital issue, the steel giant’s
continued rapid expansion, financed to
a disproportionate extent internally, as-
sures extra benefits for shareholders in
the not too distant future.
BHP’s rapid growth and monumental
strength appear in the analytical table
below.
The showing of Fixed Assets and Re-
placement Provisions separately (instead
of as a net figure) seems justified by the
revaluation of assets as recently as 1961,
with the concurrent adoption of a rapid
depreciation policy.
In comparing 1963 balance sheet
movements with those in 1962, it should
be remembered that the latter were en-
larged by bringing subsidiaries to a com-
mon accounting date, as well as by the
one-for-six capital issue and part pro-
ceeds from the debenture issue.
Many people were disappointed when
the dividend was reduced from 8J to
6£ p.c., following the one-for-two bonus
issue in 1960-61, and the one-for-six
par issue in 1961-62.
Shareholders numbered 94,407 last
May, 88 p.c. on Australian and New
Zealand registers.
However, many more Australians are
directly and indirectly concerned with
results from this their largest public
company when beneficial interests in
holdings by life offices, superannuation
and other investment media are taken
into account.
It is true that shareholders were given
priority in the allotment of 7 p.c. de-
bentures in April, 1962. The return has
been satisfactory, particularly in view of
the subsequent falling trend of interest
rates, and the debentures now stand at
a substantial premium.
The dividend was sparingly raised to
7-1/12 p.c. for the 1962-63 year, while
the interim to be paid in November
points to not less than 7i p.c. being paid
for the current 1963-64 year, which ends
on May 31.
Further dividend improvement is ob-
viously necessary to encourage the pay-
ment of 525. 6d. for a £1 par share yield-
ing only 2.8 p.c. a year less
than savings bank interest.
Sophisticated investors, who are less
concerned with immediate taxable in-
come, will set greater store by the earn-
ings yield of about 5} p.c.
But no public company can indefinitely
continue to subordinate the interests of
shareholders to the extent that BHP
has done in recent years. This should not
be expected from a company that accom-
plishes essential national tasks with sup-
erb operating efficiency and financial
management.
Consider these figures from the recent
accounts. BHP in 1962-63 paid out al-
most £59 million in wages and allowed
an additional £1.6 million for future
fringe benefits. It put aside almost £27
million for the purpose of preserving its
assets. And it provided £13.7 million
to meet income tax on the year’s earn-
ings.
Shareholders in striking contrast
—received only £7,983,334 in divi-
dend payments from their funds totalling
£249,112,472 at last balancing date.
Results for the past year, however,
reveal considerable improvement, with
stated earnings of £16,396,448 (6.6 p.c.
on shareholders’ funds at May 31) show-
ing an increase of almost 14 p.c. on un-
changed capital.
This improvement should be continu-
ing in the current year for several
reasons.
A larger proportion of increasing out-
put is being sold on the domestic mar-
ket. This will avoid some of the greater
costs from previous sales of smaller
batches on export markets.
Previous impediments to current pro-
duction from construction and the bring-
ing into operation of the new “LD” basic
oxygen process at Port Kembla and
Newcastle will be removed.
Substantial economies should now be
coming to light, as also from the new
electrolytic tinning plant at Port Kembla,
since it is now operating at full capacity.
Income tax may be less severe, if a
larger proportion of capital expenditure
qualifies for the 20 p.c. investment al-
lowance.
Generally, a larger part of recent
capital investments will bring in more
revenue.
Despite larger earnings, BHP provided
£ 1,218,454 less for income tax in 1962-
63. During the year an amount of
£4,650,456 was withdrawn from ac-
cumulated provisions for income tax.
The latter, standing at £19,797,211 on
May 31, are included in Current Lia-
bilities in the table below.
BHP, unlike most other companies,
increased its expansion and export sales
during the recession, thereby facilitating
the return to prosperity.
Capital expenditures on freeholds,
leaseholds, plant and machinery have
been as follows in recent years:
£ million
1959- ' 28
1960- 40
1961- 51
1962- 44
Australia had again become a net
importer of steel in the second half of
1960 and early part of 1961, but, with
the subsequent fall in home demand, a
substantial surplus became available for
export.
BHP had deliberately planned excess
pig-iron producing capacity for the pur-
pose of exporting. Similarly, it is allow-
ing a margin for exporting tinplate and
other products in its present expansion
plans.
Major operating units were kept work-
ing to capacity by an increase in exports
from £lB million in 1960-61 to £29
million in 1961-62. Proceeds of exports
dropped back to £ 16 million in 1962-63.
Workers have every reason to be
grateful for the beneficial effects of the
company’s policy on employment. The
company’s labor force increased by 3250
in 1960-61, by 6500 in 1961-62 and
again by 900 in 1962-63. Employees
numbered 44,000 on May 31.
Although last year’s capital expendi-
ture was less than anticipated, some
major projects cost less than had been
estimated, and there were delays because
of changes in the design of other pro-
jects, which, however, will be completed
on time.
BHP is Australia’s steel industry. Al-
ready it is the largest and most fully-
integrated organisation of its kind in the
British Commonwealth, and comparable
with the world’s best.
There is no foreseeable limit to the
company’s expansion. Steel ingot pro-
duction, which has increased in the past
five years by more than a million tons
to 4,256,796 tons, could reach 6,000,000
tons in the later sixties.
Much of the capital expenditure in
recent years has gone into modernising
the Newcastle and Port Kembla plants.
While the emphasis has been on the
expansion of Port Kembla until recently,
Whyalla. in South Australia has now
become the chief centre for expansion.
Incidentally, capital construction in


the future should have a smaller adverse
effect on current production because of
the switch of emphasis to Whyalla.
It is impossible to detail programmes
spread throughout all States, which in-
clude the finding and mining of raw
materials and the making of wire, to
the construction of large modern ships.
There is some risk that the rate of
expansion may be retarded by the
present increasing shortage of skilled
labor as it was in 1960-61.
Sir Colin Syme has also emphasised
the vital necessity to hold costs, be-
cause planned increases in world steel-
making capacity have been exerting
downward pressure on export prices.
This must refer to wage-costs, because
the company could scarcely do more
than it is doing to improve technology
and productivity, and to cheapen the
cost of servicing the capital required.
A desire for economical servicing of
capital prompted the decision in 1962 to
raise £30,816,475 by issuing debenture
stock, here and in London.
The recent accounts show that BHP
has built up its working capital to £BO
million, including £49 million in short-
dated Government securities.
Moreover, all but £8.4 million of
capital expenditure amounting to £43.8
million in 1962-63 was covered by the
retained cash flow from depreciation pro-
vision and earnings held back.
The company is closer to self-finan-
cing than can any longer be considered
desirable and necessary.
Directors have intimated that future
cash issues might be at a premium,
following the run of four par issues.
Present relatively low interest rates
could easily tempt them to gear the
company’s capital to larger long-term
borrowings, by further issues of deben-
ture stock.
Better times are in sight for share-
holders, whether directly through an in-
crease in the dividend rate, or indi-
rectly through a further bonus issue,
for which the accounts reveal ample
scope.
Although the strike at the Newcastle
works was disturbing, this is no time to
sell a great growth stock. Its price at
the time of writing is not far above the
year’s low point of 495. 6d. last May.
Experience shows that year after year,
at least since 1956, speculative gains
have been available by buying near low
points.

Strong Rise in Steel Output
npHE October strike at BHP’s steelworks
was short-lived and, at a time when
the share market was suffering some
nervousness, production figures suddenly
appeared which showed a rise of 11 p.c.
in steel output for the September quarter.
Pig iron production now is running
about 13 p.c. higher than a year ago and
the annual rate of steel ingot production
is nudging 5 million tons,
Tangible evidence is appearing of the
re-organisation of the BHP steelworks,
including the installation of two new
oxygen furnaces which gave some prob-
lems during the initial stages,
The changeover to the new type of
oxygen - produced steel will not be
achieved overnight, but production is
creeping steadily upwards.
The tinplate mill is now making an
important contribution to profits and
the Newcastle plant has been expanded
by adding a new rod mill, a new bloom
mill and a fourth blast furnace.
Some concern has been expressed at
the rise in imports of structural steel
but, when a lumbering steel giant begins
to reorganise and install extra plant,
there is some inevitable dislocation.
The question of price, of course, must
be kept to the fore, with Japanese struc-
tural steel enjoying a good run at the
moment.
So far BHP has shown an ability to
meet competition from overseas and,
as it completes each stage of its re-
organisation, it will be in a stronger posi-
tion to cut costs.

Superb Performance
A spurt in earning rate from 21.7 to
about 25 p.c. is a fine achievement
by Allied Mills Ltd of Sydney.
Latest profit of £510,000 for the year
to August 31 was compared by the com-
pany with £421,178 for 1961-62, which
was after writing off a capital loss of
£23,343.
If the 1962-63 figure includes no
capital profit and is truly a trading re-
sult the company deserves congratula-
tions.
Depreciation was up substantially but
tax provision approximately the same.
Minority interests in the company are
sizeable, hence the relatively high look-
ing tax provision.
The company is no longer dependent
on any one industry, but has fingers in
the flour, bakery, stock foods and edible
oil pies. John Darling and Son, of
Melbourne, was taken over in March
1962. Obviously there is strength
through union.


MARKET POINTERS
Following the Vogue?
\ Sydney broker last week said that
'*"*■ today’s investor (or speculator) is
inclined to follow the mob, often to his
eventual disadvantage. It it’s fashionable
to buy sugar shares, or if oils are in
vogue, buyers seem to gravitate to such
markets.
The cardinal rule, of course, is not to
buy when everyone else is buying,
because a market needs buyers every
day of the year and not just a spasmodic
surge over a week or so.
This is all very well. Frequently the
investor is prompted into buying a stock
because of sudden publicity. Otherwise
he may display little or no interest in the
market.
Too often when he has money avail-
able to invest, he finds the market has
just reached a peak and he is buying at
the top.
So the old adage “buy in gloom” has
much to recommend it. Unfortunately,
when economic conditions look bleak,
the share buyer is preoccupied with other
matters, including such things as a
request from the bank manager to reduce
the overdraft.
Two gloom stocks which received a
sudden life recently were SAVOY COR-
PORATION and FINANCE AND
GUARANTEE. Both companies re-
ported takeover feelers.
Par value (55.) appears to be a high
price for both shares at this stage. But
takeover history often shows remarkable
rehabilitation efforts to the benefit of
shareholders.
HOLYMAN WOODS, at Is., is a case
in point.
★ ★ ★
Tt was fashionable last week to get into
1 UNITED TELECASTERS LTD.
when the stags rushed to sell. The long-
term argument is that this holder of
Sydney’s third commercial television
licence must achieve a high •ranking in
the market over the next few years.
True, it will be a two years’ wait
before profits start to appear and three
years before a dividend (if other
operators are a guide). But what other
stocks can you buy which offer similar
promises, investors ask.
Sober analysis suggests that the heavy
capitalisation of the latest Sydney TV
station and the intense competition it
faces will make it difficult for the new-
comer to achieve the same earning rate
as its two main competitors. But the
share market assumes that television
must continue to boom, thus providing
more than sufficient advertising revenue
to justify a third commercial TV station.
Basis for this is the indication that
population is rising swiftly and that TV
commercials will remain as inevitable as
death and taxes. Competition for sales
by manufacturers and distributors should
become more intense, thus providing
greater need for promotion through all
media, including TV.
Even so, it is apparent that the popu-
larity of TV shares rather than an
analysis of possible earning rates is the
main reason prompting purchase at the
moment. The shares may fluctuate in
price. Yet at prices around 11s. the long-
term buyer may shrug his shoulders and
say this is one stock to put away. He
even hints darkly that takeover prospects
must always be considered.

A few guests at the Menzies Hotel
opening in Sydney were asking why
the building company, PROJECT DE-
VELOPMENT, was so strong in the
market. Curiosity was aroused by the
purchase of several stock options in
Project Development shares.
Rumor is that Project Development
Corporation, the parent of Wynyard
Holdings Ltd, may be interested in
FEDERAL HOTELS’ ss. shares, which
have slumped to around 2s. lOd. Why?
Project Development already is linked
with Federal, which is managing the
Menzies Hotel. Looking purely at
Federal on an assets basis, it might be
possible to re-convert Hampton Court
(Sydney) to home units, sell off the
Brisbane and Tasmanian interests and
concentrate on maintaining a tight little
operation.
★ ★ ★
Ougar shares soared again following a
sharp rise in the price of sugar on
the London market. Statistics look good
at the moment. But past experience
suggests two things. When prices rise
spectacularly, sellers of stocks are
attracted and growers are encouraged to
increase their plantings (including beet
sugar). If prices are too high consumers
don’t buy or seek alternative supplies.
Current world shortages assure an
excellent year for producers. Yet it is
anyone’s guess when the inevitable law
of supply and demand will catch up.
After some of the more spectacular
rises in Australian sugar company shares,
the more conservative brokers are
suggesting that CSR, with its variety of
interests, could be a two-way bet.
★ ★ ★
IIfHiLE talking about sugar-growing, it
is pertinent to remember that ferti-
liser must enjoy tremendous demand in
the next few years.
Russia recently gave a sharp pointer to
this when it was revealed that the grain
shortage in Communist countries could
have been alleviated if more fertiliser
had been used. Figures from Europe
indicate that huge quantities of fertiliser
will be used in the next few years.
Sugar requires nitrogenous fertiliser,
which did not qualify for the recent
Federal bounty on fertilisers.
Most of the Australian fertiliser
companies, however, are heavily engaged
in the production of superphosphate.
AUSTRALIAN FERTILIZERS LTD,
one of the leaders in the field, claims
that its sales of superphosphate increased
by 87 p.c. in the past five years. A fur-
ther sharp stimulus to sales is expected
because of the superphosphate bounty.
So Australian Fertilizers £1 shares,
even at the high level of 675., look like
a put away proposition.
* * *
Someone suggested recently that ERIC
ANDERSON, the electrical retailer,
could one day be absorbed into the
MLC-H. G. PALMER chain. Perhaps
so. But with a share market at very high
levels, the type of stock which must be
purchased is one which can afford to
suffer fluctuations. Into this category
comes MLC, whose £1 shares are selling
at around £6 \2s. to yield a meagre
2 p.c.
Small investors look aghast when it
is suggested they buy such high-priced
shares. Experience has proved that the
good shares are best in the long run.
MLC will participate in Australia’s
growth more than most. And don’t for-
get that brokerage on the “big" shares
is always much cheaper (Ik p.c. on
shares over £4) than the “little" ones.


OIL CORNER
Picking the Christmas Box
/\il shares, after a strong showing
when the “Associated” group
claimed good flows at Richmond No. 1,
have subsided. Undeterred, there are
plenty of characters drifting around the
Stock Exchange who talk confidentially
from the side of the mouth about the
Christmas strike.
The precedent already has been set.
Ampol Exploration in West Australia
and Union-Kern-AOG at Moonie in
Queensland touched off oil market booms
in the month of December. Cabawin in
Queensland was out of fashion, because
the strike occurred in April. And, any-
way, it did not prove commercial in
itself.
So the speculators are still prepared
to gamble that December once again
may be the month for another oil strike.
They are not prepared to listen to ex-
planations of coincidence or an analysis
of drilling programmes. At least they
are honest in one major respect. They
accept it as a pure gamble.
Even the experts say they can never
really tell what is down below until the
drill probes the formations. But they
all admit a tremendous amount of
drilling still lies ahead.
★ ★ ★
TITho are the likely contenders for a
** Christmas strike?
UNION-KERN-AOG gets favorable
mention because it has been so successful
up to now and is drilling at a fast rate.
It must have accumulated a great deal of
knowledge about Queensland geological
formations by now. It has both Cabawin
and Moonie as strings to its bow.
Oil speculators insist that the Union-
Kern-AOG group must find an extension
of Moonie before long. That is why
there have been so many call options
written in these shares.
AUSTRALIAN ASSOCIATED OIL,
also drilling in Queensland, is another in
the same category. Most speculators were
convinced that the Associated group
would find an extension of Richmond
into a potentially large structure at
Ingle, 4i miles to the north-west.
Subsequent drilling proved very tight
sands in nearby areas. Speculators are
still hopeful, especially those who
bought at high prices.
★ ★ ★
TUlking about “sands”, most people
A imagine that sand in oil jargon
means sand like beach sand. It doesn’t.
Porous sands which hold oil look (to a
layman) like a lot of rough crystals
stuck together. Tight sands, which are
non-porous, looks like really hard rock.
Another popular misconception faced
by the poor speculator who puts up his
money to buy oil shares is that oil is
sitting in a large pool underneath a
layer of rock and all you need to do is
drill a hole through the upper rock and
the oil will gush out.
Oil is trapped in rock formations
under terrific pressure. Because it was
formed countless years ago in marshes
or inland areas where seas once flowed,
salt water sometimes still exists, support-
ing the oil on a cushion. The rock
formations, though, are so varied and
broken that oil tends to seep in all
directions trying to find an outlet. For
this reason, many small traps or tiny
pools exist after the main body of oil
has disappeared. The oil explorer who
uncovers these small traps is often mis-
led, just like the gold miner who dis-
covers “fool’s gold”.
It’s a tricky business. And announce-
ments of a strike can be full of dis-
appointment when the oil drill continues
to probe further. Australians have had
this experience. They are not as
unsophisticated as they were in the past.
They must also recognise that it takes
vast amounts of money to develop an oil
field. Oil drillers say that the public is
not the only group which should be
reminded of this. They want greater
assistance from the Federal and State
Governments and less of a grab in
royalties after they have gone through
the costly and painstaking business of
finding oil.
* ★ ★
"E'xoil’s chairman, Mr C. W. Siller,
had a crack at the Federal Govern-
ment last week when he pointed out that
oil subsidies were not being paid
quickly enough and, in fact, usually
were paid to exploration companies late
in the financial year. The uneven flow
of subsidy money placed a strain on
company finances. Sometimes it means
that shareholders are called upon for
money sooner than necessary.
Exoil was the most active oil share
in October because a pat on the back
from the influential American Oil and
Gas Journal which predicted that the
Amadeus Basin, being drilled by Exoil,
would prove to be the next Australian
oil producer.
Part of the evidence on which the
American Oil and Gas Journal based
its opinion was the result of a core
taken at the relatively high level of
652 ft by the Commonwealth Bureau
of Mineral Resources, which revealed
oil in a four-foot section of sands. But
there also was evidence that the oil
could have seeped away because cores
taken from fine-grained quartz sand
was stained in fractures with waxy, 17.5
degrees gravity (heavy) oil, indicating
that it was residual oil which had lost
its lighter fractions by seepage.
This is the infuriating thing about
oil search. Where did the seepage go?
Exoil has a well called the Mereenie
No. 1 which is being drilled near the
test bore sunk by the Bureau of Mineral
Resources. So the market doubtless will
watch the shares carefully.
The ss. par value shares now are
paid to 2s. and are still relatively low
in price compared with many others.
But there are more than 17 million
shares issued, which means there are
plenty of potential profit-takers if the
shares move up.
★ ★ ★
HThe influence of call options on the
oil share market is a very potent
force. Not only do writers of stock
options “cover” their commitment by
buying shares at the time of writing the
option. They sometimes create a false
market when they are FORCED to
cover shares they don’t own. This has
happened when the option is exercised
or when prices rise out of all proportion
to the price at which the option was
written.
These days the sharebrokers who,
generally, act as intermediaries between
the buyer of the option and the writer
(for which they receive a brokerage
commission from the stock options firm
plus a further two brokerages if the
stock is bought and later exercised)
insist that the stock be held by the
writer. In some cases the writer is
required to lodge the stock plus a signed
transfer with the broker through whom
he deals. This is a recent move because
some writers were caught badly after
they underwrote options on stocks they
did not own.
When shares in the Associated Oil
stable rose sharply on the Richmond
strike, many stock option writers were
fighting fiercely to buy shares to cover
their commitment. Even when prices
tended to fall again, option writers were
still in there buying shares which they
needed to cover options.
It gets tough, however, if a broker
deals directly in options. When he buys
an option, he doesn’t need to worry
about brokerage charges before he
makes a profit. Many an option has
been exercised when, on the surface,
it would be unprofitable if brokerage
charges were added.


BRAMBLES INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Statement of the Chairman, Mr. R. A. Dickson, to Shareholders
of the 9th Annual General Meeting on 28th October, 1963
Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is again my privilege to address you at this our ninth
Annual General Meeting.
The Directors’ Report and the Accounts for the year ended
30th June, 1963, have been in your hands for the past month,
and with your permission will be taken as read.
This time a year ago I outlined that a great deal was
being done to restore the earning capacity of the assets
employed throughout the many activities of your Company.
In the intervening period, considerable reorganisation has
taken place, and some mention of those measures was made
in the interim report to stockholders dated Ist April, 1963.
It was indicated then that the pattern of the measures being
taken was long term in character and that your Directors
did not anticipate the year under review would benefit the
Company to any appreciable extent.
Your Directors consider that the year just completed has
.-been indeed a very satisfactory one. In the first place, the
reorganisation has been now virtually completed, and arising
out of it have come many lasting economies throughout the
Group of Companies. In the process of this change a number
of realistic adjustments were made for stock valuations to
bring them more in keeping with current trading conditions.
A detailed examination was made of the plant, machinery
and rolling stock in all operating subsidiaries, and substantial
disposals of old or obsolete equipment resulted during the
period. Considerable expenditure was incurred in the develop-
ment of new products and services, and all of these expenses
have been written off this year.
During the last six months of the trading year, your
Company through its subsidiary, M. & B. Steel and Engineer-
ing Supplies Pty. Limited, extended its activities as iron and
steel merchants into the Sydney market, and the establish-
ment expenses associated with its early months of trading
have again been provided for in the Consolidated Net Profit
for the year.
Likewise the modernisation of the Newcastle foundries of
our subsidiary, James Tickle & Sons Pty. Limited, completed
during the latter part of the trading year, caused considerable
disruption to production and duplication of certain costs
during its transfer and relocation to new premises at
Carrington.
Despite the effect that these actions have had on trading
profits for the year ended 30th June, 1963, the confidence
expressed by your Directors this time last year and again in
April of this year of being able to maintain dividend at the
rate of 20 per cent per annum has been more than
substantiated.
The tax provision is low in relation to the profits, but on
the other hand there are expenses, losses and write-offs of
a non-recurring character totalling £186,497 which equate
the lowness of the tax provision.
Trading conditions throughout the whole of the undertaking
showed definite improvement during the year, although it is
well recognised that the Australian economy generally is
still below its normal capacity. In the industrial contracting
and equipment hiring activities of the Company good results
were achieved, and had it not been for the excessive wet
weather that prevailed for so much of the second half of
the trading year the level of profitability would have been
a great deal more satisfactory.
The Company has still to derive full benefits from those
newly-acquired companies which came into the Brambles
Group during the later part of the year. We refer to the
long-established customs and shipping agency business of
C. A. Pigott & Co. Pty. Limited of Melbourne, and also
that of Liquid Cartage Co. Pty. Limited of both Melbourne
and Sydney, which is today a leading operator in the inter-
state and intrastate haulage of bulk liquid products.
In the current year of 1963/64 your Company has already
concluded negotiations to acquire for cash an interest in the
long-established customs, shipping agency and transport
business of Frank Manford Pty. Limited of Perth, which will
provide a further extension of this particular network of
activities in the Brambles organisation.
This additional investment by your Company did not occur
until after the close of the last financial year, and it is
anticipated that it will make a satisfactory contribution to
future Group profits.
Our associate company, Wilckens Hornibrook Brambles
Constructions Limited of South Australia, has been a success-
ful tenderer for two large civil contracts in that State.
Work is well in progress on the Torrens Gorge Deviation Road
contract, and an extension to the main sewerage trunk
scheme for Adelaide is about to commence. Contracts in
hand exceed £3 million and it is unlikely that benefits by
way of dividends from the joint company will accrue before
the 1964/65 year.
During the year certain activities were relocated which
allowed for the sale of a number of freehold properties, and
this will provide continuing benefits in future years from the
release of these funds into more profitable avenues. Several
new branches have been opened, notably in Commercial
Transport Division—at Adelaide for Lee Transport Co. Limited
and at Canberra for Brambles Transport whilst many
improvements were made to our terminals and depots in the
various States of the Commonwealth.
Considerable progress has been made in the development
of the site at the corner of Dacey Avenue and Dowling
Street, Waterloo. Already on part of this seven and one-half
acre site has been established first-class steelyard facilities
for M. & B. Steel and Engineering Supplies Pty. Limited,
following its entry into the Sydney market as iron and steel
merchants. An acre and a half of covered storage is being
fully utilised by another subsidiary, Cleland’s Bonded &
Free Stores Pty. Limited, and another sector is being prepared
for our civil contracting division of A. Bradshaw (Excavations)
Pty. Limited.
The registered office and headquarters of your Company has
also recently been transferred to this location. There is
approximately four acres of land still available for other
development and a number of proposals are currently being
considered by your Board so as to more gainfully exploit the
potential of this very fine site.
The Board wishes to place on record its appreciation for
the manner in which the management and staff of all
companies within the Brambles Group accepted the challenge
of what was required to be done to eliminate unprofitable
activities and restore a greater earning power on funds
employed.
Your Company has concluded the year of 1962/63 in a strong
financial position. It is recommended that after reasonable
transfers to reserves a final dividend be paid of sixpence (6d.)
per share, making one shilling (1/-) per share for the year
under review, this being the sixth consecutive year in which
this rate of dividend has been paid. In the opinion of your
Board their actions since the last Annual General Meeting
should ensure continuation of their dividend policy in the
future.
In conclusion, may we remind you as stockholders that
Brambles is essentially a service organisation to a wide cross-
section of Australian industry. Your active support by using
and recommending the many services offered Is in your
interest as well as encouraging the continued prosperity of
your Company.
I now formally move the adoption of the Directors’ Report
and Accounts for the year ended 30th June, 1963.
R. A. DICKSON.
Chairman.

INVESTMENT SECTION
Galloping in all Directions
Opeaking at the annual meeting, the
managing director of Retailers Dis-
count Ltd (Receiver Appointed) said to
shareholders: “I have failed the company
in my management and my selection of
management. We went into something
I didn't know very much about. In
1958-59 everybody was making a for-
tune financing land developers and
small businesses.” (Factoring was also
tried with little success.)
This apology for the loss of £268,134
in the year to June 30, 1963, after bad
debts of £288,482, was cold comfort for
shareholders.
The ss. shares eased from ss. 6d.
to 4s. 9d. in the month of September,
1962, when an account with a Mel-
bourne builder for £201,000 came under
the scrutiny of the company’s auditors,
who requested further security. The
shares are now valued by the market at
around 6d.
That particular debt has been written
down to £103,000. (Total bad and
doubtful debts charged against 1962-63
trading results were £288,482.)
The receiver appointed by the Bank
of New South Wales Nominees, Mr
H. V. Quinton, was not present at the
meeting. He intends to carry on the
company. A statement is expected from
him in December-January.
The chairman (Mr M. Rosenblum)
told shareholders that debenture holders
were owed £1.4 million, while the com-
pany at present has £170,000 in cash
on short call.
He declined to make any forecast of
the full extent of the losses, or the
realisable value of the assets.
Shareholders will have to sweat it out.
Chief assets of the group, according
to accounts as at June 30, 1963, were
loans as follows: Hire purchase debtors,
after providing for doubtful debts,
£1,041,196, less unearned interest of
£92,585; business loans and advances,
after providing for doubtful debts,
£773,835, less unearned interest of
£149,290; home finance loans, £475,869,
less unearned interest, £205,685; factor-
ing debtors, £63,216; land and property
loans, after providing for doubtful debts,
£103,108 making a net total of
£2,009,664.
Issued capital of £450,000 less debit
balance of profit and loss account
£194,763, leaves £255,237 as share-
holders’ funds.
The auditors do not qualify their
report to members in any way. In their
opinion the 1962-63 accounts “give a
true and fair view of affairs and loss of
the company and of the group.”
Backwash From Broadbeach
A pparently the auditors of Federal
Hotels are not satisfied with the
version given by The Bulletin two
issues back of their qualification to the
consolidated accounts of the group. In
their view the £550,000 book value of
the assets of the Broadbeach Hotel, the
figure which the chairman gave The
Bulletin, is considerably lower than is
actually the case, though of course this
cannot be gleaned from the consolidated

value was placed on this turnover.
Group profit increased only marginally
to a record £1,846,904 in a period of
consolidation.
Total assets of the group have risen
by 49 p.c. to £49.2 million in the last
three years this is partly explained by the
1960 takeover of Hardie Rubber, and of
Kangaroo Petroleum Holdings in 1962.
But it also reflects major investment
on the lubricating oil refinery at Kurnell
(£1,437,500 directly), the transfer of
Hardie’s general products plant to
Auburn, and purchase of two passenger-
cargo ships for the far-Eastern run.
Earning rates have been slugged in
the last three years, but benefits should
accrue soon. The oil refinery should be
fully on steam early in 1964, so that
there is firm reason for the belief that
the present 15.6 p.c. rate of profit to
capital will be improved upon.
No Dividend Yet
A nderson Meat continues to amass
funds, without any distribution to
shareholders, for the third year after the
disastrous loss in 1959-60.
Profit of £112,995 for the year to
June 30, 1963, compared with £47,300
in 1961-62, gave an attractive earning
rate of 18.4 p.c., but it was after very
low tax provision of £16,200.
All subsidiaries traded profitably with
the exception of Fresh Food and Ice
(QTd) Pty, which was placed in receiver-
ship. Group sales rose 15.6 p.c. mostly
in the domestic market. Anderson has
been anxious to reduce dependence on
export markets ever since difficulties in
1959.
The bacon industry should improve
with an increase in the supply of pigs
after the New Year, according to Ander-
son’s annual report.
Entry to the lamb and mutton trade
has been facilitated by the takeover of
M. E. Fitzgerald, of Homebush (NSW).
The 20s. shares have slipped about
3s. to 19s. in the last six weeks or so.
Tariff Benefits
Profit of Associated Pulp and Paper
Mills was short of the 1959 peak,
but sales rose from £14.4 million in
1961-62 to> a record £18.5 million in
the latest year to June.
(The previous sales peak was £17.1
million in 1960-61.)
Sales of fine papers rose from £8.2


to £10.9 million, of coated papers and
boards from £1.6 to £2.5 million, and
of “Burnieboard” from £2.7 to £3
million.
Directors consider the full effects of
increased tariff protection recently
granted may not yet have been felt. They
expect considerable benefits to result.
Bottled-up Value
FTlhe 10s. shares of Fowlers Vacola
Manufacturing Co. Ltd, now selling
at around 7s. though supported by
tangible assets of 235. Id., could be a
tasty picking for local or overseas
prowlers in the food field.
In 43 years as a public company,
Fowlers has always earned a profit and
paid a dividend faithfully. The latest
trading period to April 30, however,
only produced a profit of £3,183, and
dividend was halved to 5 p.c.
The group cans and preserves fruit
and vegetables in Victoria and NSW,
makes bottling and preserving equip-
ment, and is a general engineer.
Bad weather in SA and WA reduced
the amount of fruit available for home
bottling, while in Victoria and NSW a
record pack of canned fruit (mainly
peaches) flooded the market at bargain
prices.
Directors spoke of intense competition
in the grocery trade, with higher
advertising and selling costs.
While the days of home bottling may
be numbered, the company’s own can-
ning and preserving activities could
interest others, particularly as the Mel-
bourne plant is housed in a new factory
in Thomas Street, Hawthorn.
The old site in Power Street was sold
late in 1962, allowing liquidation of a
£52,317 mortgage and a reduction in
fixed costs. The changeover to the new
factory was costlier than expected.
Shareholders of this hitherto con-
sistent profit-earner should not relinquish
their holdings at present levels or new-
comers may benefit from their lack of
faith.
Years Of Grace
/Chairman of Grace Brothers, Mr
B. A. Grace, says shareholders can
expect further benefits as the company
continues to “progress and consolidate.”
Both the company’s retail division
and storage and removal branch ex-
perienced better sales compared with the
previous year, Mr Grace told the annual
general meeting. The £84,648 profit
rise for 1962-63 suggested the policy of
expansion in the suburbs. And the
"Sometimes I think he delegates too much authority!"
removal and storage field was bearing
fruit.
The profit rise was the largest of five
successive increases. All the company’s
stores Broadway, Parramatta, Chats-
wood, Brookvale had experienced a
good year.
The Chatswood store had been so
well received it had to expand into the
Grace Arcade for extra merchandising
areas.
Back To Scrap Metal
one-time successful scrap metal
merchant Albert G. Sims Ltd has
divested itself of diversifications and
now appears capable of earning profits
once again.
In fact a profit of £120,017 was made
on normal operations in the second half
of the year to June 30, 1963, but this
was partly offset by a loss of £52,971
on the Wangcinella’s operations. This
ship has since been sold.
In the first half shipping lost £178,320,
and scrap trading £33,818. The net
result for the year was thus £155,119
loss, after £10,027 for tax and £236,670
for depreciation.
Sims struck trouble in 1960-61 and
afterwards, with a Hong Kong shipping
venture, a Melbourne pig-iron plant,
Donson Products (a hardware business),
and litigation over the Morts Dock
property. Of the latter 21 acres, 7£
have been sold, but the rest of the
difficulties have been removed by sale
or closing down.
Trouble is now that Sims is saddled
with a capital of £2.9 million compared
with less than £1 million in 1959. Two
premium issues, conversion of notes,
and a couple of takeovers accounted for
the enlargement.
A full year’s dividend of £12,000 on
the preference capital has been deferred.
Long-term contracts and domestic
arrangements now being negotiated
should ensure profits in 1963-64, said
directors in a preliminary statement.
There may therefore be some cautious
appreciation in the shares later in the
year from their present level of 3s.
Electric Shocks
amongst electrical appliance
distributors rebounded on two manu-
facturers, Electronic Industries Ltd and
Malley Ltd, during the last financial year
to June.
Electronic wrote off £339,362 in bad
debts (£288,179 in 1961-62) before arri-
ving at profit of £637,918 (£406,035).
Directors now report that the abnormal
amount of bad debts made the year’s net
result slightly less than expected in
March. At that time, directors declared


that profit in the December half-year was
greater than in the previous full 12
months.
Their predictions that the year’s profit
would adequately cover the 12i p.c. divi-
dend did not come to pass. However,
strong reserves and the company’s steady
return towards normal profits influenced
them to declare an unchanged dividend
of 12i p.c.
The preliminary report of 1962-63
trading has done nothing for a permanent
revival of confidence in this company,
which fell from market grace two years
ago.
Malley’s annual report reveals an ab-
normally high write-off for bad debts,
totalling £121,441. This was chiefly in
respect of accounts with members of the
Reid Murray group and Inglis Electrix.
The true position of the former will not
be known for some time, but directors
have made substantial provisions which
are adequate in their opinion and in the
light of current information.
Other items of an abnormal character
affecting the latest profit were the high
operating costs of a non-recurring nature,
resulting from consolidation of factory
activities and, on the other hand, inclu-
sion of £45,716 for a loss-of-profit insur-
ance claim.
Malley’s directors described trading
conditions as highly competitive, though
the rate of building approvals was im-
proving and the company’s products were
increasing their market penetration.
Nearly all sections of the Sydney and
Brisbane plants were working to capa-
city. The move from Revesby to Auburn,
now completed after some delays and
considerable trouble, should assist this
year’s profitability.
Installation of EDP equipment and
provision of the most up-to-date experi-
mental and testing equipment for re-
search add up to give a more favorable
all-round impression than Electronic.
Certainly there are fewer unpredictable
elements in Malley’s business.
Thinking Of Shareholders
Advertiser Newspapers Ltd of
Adelaide will double ordinary capital
by a one-for-one bonus.
Conversion of £1,008,000 in notes to
shares in January, 1963, brought issued
ordinary capital to £2,315,983. In mid-
October, this was increased by £125,000
issued as consideration for National
Paper Industries Pty.
Capital after the bonus will be
£4,799,966 including £168,000 prefer-
ence.
New dividend of 10 p.c. means a
33 p.c. lift in income for shareholders.
(The previous rate was 15 p.c.)
Directors infer that the four-year
period of great capital expenditure on
new buildings, plant, and the television
investment is now over. They said it
was time shareholders received a greater
share of the yearly profits.
Herald and Weekly Times Ltd of
Melbourne holds about 30 p.c. of
Advertiser’s ordinary shares.
Drawing Office Profits
TArawing Office Industries Ltd, of Syd-
ney, is restoring the dividend to
12i p.c. after two years at 10 p.c. New
earning rate is 18.8 p.c. on unchanged
capital.
Its trading experience in 1962-63
roughly parallels that of its Melbourne
counterpart, Max Wurcker (Holdings)
Ltd.
Gair’s Unfair Weather
Although the £47,996 net profit of
Gair’s Industries, the Melbourne
canvas goods manufacturer, was the
lowest since 1959 and down about
18 p.c. on the near record year 1961-62,
it was apparently satisfactory in the
eyes of the board. But it is pretty ob-
vious from the fact that turnover again
exceeded £1 million profit margins must
have been eroded.
Be that as it may the report is opti-
mistic on the score of this year’s trading,
saying that sales are up on the equiva-
lent period last year and heading higher,
at least in the main subsidiary, Gair’s
Pty Ltd, which added new lines to its
Manchester range last year.
It seems as if last year’s indifferent
summer was responsible for the slight
setback, because the main trouble ap-
pears to have been with the foldaway
furniture section, in which the report
says trade competition has been un-
usually severe. The company is con-
cerned with the swing away from its
wooden-folding furniture to aluminium
and gives notice in the report of its
intention to adjust its production in the
new direction.
And here’s hoping for a better sum-
mer than last year’s since the com-
pany is looking forward to increasing
sales of beach and garden umbrellas.
PPW Capital Plans
A dmission that funds are surplus to a
company’s needs and a return of
capital is proposed suggest a shrinking
of activities. Such a state of affairs is
inclined to discourage market interest in
that stock.
But in the case of PPW Holdings Ltd,
indirect owner of coal hopper waggons
on the northern and southern coalfields
of NSW, the attitude would be wrong
As the holder of 122,114 shares of a
total 123,745 in PPW Ltd, which
wholly owns PPW Investments Pty Ltd,
PPW Holdings Ltd plans to return
2s. 6d. per ss. share, or a total of
£91,961.
The investment subsidiary has sold its
shareholding in A. Goninan producing
£75,000 in surplus funds.
Income will be reduced by £3OOO a
year (1963 profit was £25,563), yet
directors expect to pay a 15 p.c. dividend
on the reduced capital. The present 8 p.c.
dividend is of course equivalent to 16 p.c.
on the reconstructed capital.
A purchase at 9s. gives a net cost of
6s. 6d. after the return of capital, so the
yield would be an interesting 8.5 p.c.
Swan Song from Mary Kathleen .
TJrofits from the sale of the final
x 530,000 pounds of uranium oxide
to the UK Atomic Energy Authority will
carry over into 1964 accounts, Mary
Kathleen Uranium reported last week.
Its production would be completed
in October, but shipment would be early
in 1964. This will bring supplies to the
UK to the contracted 9 million pounds.
By August the 1963 quota was satisfied
by the shipment of 1.2 million pounds
of oxide.
Profit for the first nine months of
the 1963 calendar year is down about
£1 million to £3,142,261.
The ss. shares were recently quoted
at 17s. 3d. buyer, no seller. Shareholders
are not being short-sighted enough to
release their interest cheaply, although
the future of the mine is so uncertain.
A & R’s Narrow Margin
roup sales of Angus and Robertson,
publisher and bookseller, rose 12
p.c., and profit by 26.7 p.c. in the year
to June 30.
Earning rate, however, still just skims
the 14 p.c. dividend.
Provisions for tax and depreciation
were higher in the latest year.
Monier Borrows
/Concrete Industries (Monier) Ltd
breaks new ground by resorting to
fixed interest borrowings.
A private placement of £1 million in
7i p.c. registered notes with currencies
of 10 and 12 years has been made
through Melbourne sharebrokers A. C.
Goode and Co.
True, Monier had £441,545 in notes
at 1962 balance date. But these were
inherited from acquisitions, Standard
Portland Cement Co. and Monier
Besser.
The borrowings mark a policy change
from the numerous par issues to share-


holders and should stiffen the earning
rate.
Funds will be used on the Hurstville
shopping centre and in extra roofing-tile
plants.
Other interesting news of late was
that Mr J. W. Blaiklock, chairman of
PGH Industries, the building materials
group, and deputy chairman of DFC,
the investment banking group, has
joined the Monier board.
Less Cotton Pickings
have finally caught up with
cotton textiler Sterling Henry Ltd.
Profit is not yet announced, but the
four year old 124 p.c. dividend rate
falls to 10 p.c., with a final payment of
5 p.c.
Last year the profit fell 40 p.c. after a
boom year in 1960-61, when a sub-
stantial dividend was remitted from
Auckland Spinning Mills Ltd, before it
was sold. The 1961-62 earning rate was
15 p.c.
Bank of Adelaide
THhe Savings Bank of the Bank of
Adelaide Ltd, which began business
on May 31, 1962, more than accounted
for the company’s £19,150 increase in
profit to £252,124 for the year to
September 30, 1963.
Result includes £29,510 from the
Savings Bank, a return of 5.9 p.c. on
its paid capital of £500,000.
The chairman (Sir Arthur Rymill) last
year said the Savings Bank was con-
fidently expected to contribute usefully
to the Bank’s overall profit.
An even more useful source of
revenue is the 40 p.c. interest in Finance
Corporation of Australia Ltd. When
that company’s latest issue is fully paid
and ranking for dividends, the Bank of
Adelaide will collect £100,568 each year
if the 10 p.c. rate is maintained.
Cato Connections
A lthough Moran and Cato’s profit re-
covery from £410,298 to £434,603
was very welcome, lifting earnings from
14.1 to 15 p.c. or just 14 times cover for
the maintained 10 p.c. dividend, it was
still well below the record of £462,886
recorded in 1961-62, even if in fact the
second highest in the company’s 53 years’
history which has seen it grow from a
single store in Victoria to a chain of 165
shops in four States.
The result makes Moran and Cato
look a little more appetising to a possible
bidder on the lookout for Australia-wide
stores outlets. Though apart from the
fairly recently arrived Safeways group,
which the market thinks could con-
ceivably become interested, there appear
to be no very likely candidates, especially
as Coles and Woolworths, the two most
active bidders on the stores front in
recent years, probably have all the small
grocery shops they want now that they
are concentrating on the development of
supermarkets.
It is understood that Moran and Cato
had one or two nibbles three years ago,
but directors were not prepared to bite
at that time. Since then, of course, the
Cato connections have been prepared to
let Rosella go to Unilever for £4 million,
which has given rise to the suggestion
that they may now be in a better mood
to consider a bid for Moran and Cato,
in which they also have leading interest.
Cemac Presses On
Associated Ltd must be the
only timber or plywood merchant
to carry on regardless through the
recession. Each year profits advanced,
although a one-for-five bonus in Novem-
ber, 1960, and a placement the next
month did cut back the earning rate.
Latest result is £107,286, compared
with £96,883 in the previous year. Both
tax and depreciation provisions were
higher.
The 124 p.c. dividend was paid for
the sixth year in succession.
Cutting It Fine
T\ividend was held at 124 p.c. for 1962-
63 but Motels of Australia directors
intend to recommend a cut to 10 p.c.
for the current year, to increase the pro-
portion of profits retention.
Losses carried forward from earlier
years by a Carapark subsidiary reduced
the group’s liability for tax in the latest
June year (provision was down from
£158,041 to £77,758). Portion will be
available for rebates again this year.
The earning rate slipped from 14.4 to
13.1 p.c., despite a 61 p.c. gain in
absolute profit to £355,952.
Six new motels and additions to five
others, plus a continued high rate of
occupancy, accounted for the profit
growth.
Directors explained that 15 years
mortgage finance totalling £1.3 million
had been arranged with financial institu-
tions to replace expensive bridging
finance.
A share issue is possible in the later
stages of 1963-64, the preliminary trad-
ing report said.
In showing the present yield at 6.6
p.c. the Press has already placed the
shares on a 10 p.c. dividend basis,
although until November 22 they are
cum the final 64 p.c. (34d.).
The company is adding 14 units to
Canberra Travelodge, 35 suites to Bris-
bane Travelodge, and a 44 suite motel is
being built at Goulburn. The Stardust
Motel at Kempsey has also been taken
over recently.
Shareholders would welcome a little
consolidation.
When To Scrap Cars
PFhe Australian motor car industry is
interested in building obsolescence
into its products but doesn’t know how
to do it, says Mr. D. I. Donaldson, pre-
sident of the Chamber of Automotive
Industries of NSW.
In the course of an interview this week
he told The Bulletin the average life
of a car in Australia is 6.8 years, but the
manufacturers want to reduce this
He said some thought has been given
to the American scheme whereby, after
seven years, spare parts for particular
models of cars are removed from the
shelves. Only 10 p.c. is held for con-
tingencies.
The owner of a car more than seven
years old is thus faced with the position
of having to scrap it.
But it would be too expensive to start
in Australia, where model changes are
less frequent than they are in the Ameri-
can industry.
Interesting thoughts, especially as they
come from a man who is also managing
director of Lanock Motors, holders of
a Volkswagen franchise. Volkswagen . ..
the car that never changes.
New Tassie Float
A nother GMH dealer will join public
lists when Nettlefold’s Ltd allots
800,000 ss. shares (one-quarter of
issued capital) to the public.
Nettlefold’s has acquired the capital
of Motors Pty, Tasmanian Holden dis-
tributor, and Domestic Equipment Co.
Pty, Tasmanian distributor of Frigi-
daires. It has formed a new subsidiary,
Nettlefold Car and Truck Pty, to take
over from Robert Nettlefold Pty the dis-
tribution of Cadillacs, Pontiacs, Vaux-
halls, GMC and Bedford trucks and
utilities and GM diesej engines.
The 1963 earning rate was 24.5 p.c.,
and a 10 p.c. dividend is predicted. At
the placement price of 6s. 9d. including
charges, the income yield and earnings
yield are very attractive at 7.4 p.c. and
18.1 p.c. respectively.
Although Tasmanian stocks normally
tend to be forgotten by mainland invest-
ors, this is not likely to be the case with
Nettlefold’s. For one reason alone, the
issue has been taken firm by Messrs
Hordern Utz and Bode, members of the
Sydney Stock Exchange, who “have un-
dertaken to make wide distribution of
the stock units”. Selling brokers in
Tasmania reported that applications
had been heavy and would have to be
cut back.


SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Industries Close to the Heart
T>efore I launch forth on this week’s
transactions, I must say something
about the two industries closest to my
heart, sugar and building.
That old world sugar price has just
kept on going up and at £stglo2 is
above the record high of £lOl reached
in May this year. At this very time I
received a circular from Corrie and Co.
telling me that both CSR and Pioneer
Sugar could be confidently bought at
some shillings above the ruling market
prices.
Little wonder there has been a lot
of interest in sugar shares. CSR rose
6s. and then reacted back 3s. If I was
not so heavily invested in the company
I would come back into it again.
As for the building industry, it was
with considerable satisfaction that I read
of the strong rise in building approvals
in the September quarter. The month of
September showed a figure of 10,300
for building approvals, the highest for
any month since August, 1960. How
difficult it is to reconcile these statistics
with the pessimistic statement made by
the chairman of General Industries.
It will therefore not come as a sur-
prise that I selected Project Develop-
ment for one of the week’s purchases.
When the company was in the news, it
was selling at 11s. 3d. Neglect has
caused it to drift back to 9s.
Project Development has a number
of interests, the most important being
the subsidiary company, E. S. Clement-
son. This latter is both a builder and
civil engineer. The Government print-
ing office in Canberra, the Common-
wealth offices in Sydney, and the
Stanton Pipe factory in Melbourne are
among local projects undertaken by the
Clementson group. Further afield, a
£3,000,000 contract is held for the con-
struction of houses in Nauru and Ocean
Islands.
Project also possesses a large minority
share holding in Wynyard Holdings.
Wynyard Holdings consists of a large
office block, car park, shopping arcade
and the Menzies Hotel, all built around
and above Wynyard Station, perhaps the
major city railway station in Sydney.
The whole scheme has just been com-
pleted and so has not yet become fully
income producing. In time, it should
prove a most valuable investment.
To complete the picture are the two
successful associate companies, City
Parking Pty Ltd (operators of a car
park in Bourke Street, Melbourne) and
Thomson and Carroll Pty Ltd (engineer-
ing consultants).
Probably the biggest decision the
company has ever made is to set up a
ready-mixed concrete venture in France.
But this is more in the long term.
Profits have steadily risen since 1960
and the earning rate of 22.3 p.c. for the
past year was the highest yet. Share-
holders were not forgotten, as the
dividend was raised to 12i p.c. I picked
up 1000 shares at 9s. Id.
The other industrial buy for this week
was 500 Holyman Woods at 9s. 6d.
Anyone (including myself, fortunately)
who has been associated with this com-
pany in the last year has done well.
Under the terms of the reconstruction,
it was possible to buy 100 shares at
about Is. On the day of re-listing, the
shares sold around their par value of
ss. Since then, the shares have just
about doubled in price.
What aroused my interest in the com-
pany again was the small paragraph in
last week’s paper of the profit of
£37,855 for the four months from
March 1, this being the date when the
reconstruction became effective. If the
non-recurring expenses of £7032 and
the profit of £86,835 up to February 28
for the Hestia group is added, a total
profit figure of £131,722 is thrown out.
If you ignore the substantial tax loss
that the company is carrying and apply
normal tax rates, the profit would be
about £79,000, equal to 27 p.c. on
capital. Admittedly the company has to
face the long-term debt of £314,000 to
the Hestia family, yet the shares are
still worthy of a punt.
Before the week closed, I ventured
back into the oil market by buying 2000
Mid Eastern at Is. 6d. The market
has not taken kindly to the call next
month, with the result that the shares
are at the lowest point ever. The situa-
tion could be another Exoil. Mid
Eastern intends to spud in at Kyogle at
the same time as the call and interest in
this could well put temporary life back
into the shares.
On the selling side this week Waltons
and Plastic Coatings received their
marching orders. Total profit was a
very pleasing £166.
Transactions for this week were:
SOLD
1000 Waltons, 17/8 £866

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Boral's Stable Share Price
HThe shares of Boral Ltd seem to have
been hardly affected by the little
recession during the week of 14th to 18th
October. Admittedly they rose as high
as 30s. 3d. during August but have now
settled back to about 28s. 6d. to show a
34 p.c. yield from the current dividend
of Is. per share.
Since July, 1962, the price of the shares
has. ranged between such limits that the
expected immediate dividend yield was
rarely less than 34 p.c. or more than 4 p.c.
Having in mind that since the beginning
of 1963 the company has issued (or has
engaged itself to issue) more than 8.7
million shares in acquisitions, the stability
of the share price is quite remarkable.
Ordinary capital will have increased by
54 p.c. in less than nine months when
the issue of shares for Mount Lyell In-
vestments and Gas Supply Co. is com-
pleted.
Furthermore, over the last 10 years,
new capital raisings will have amounted
to approximately £4.7 million par value
but only £0.75 million or less than 16
p.c, has been offered to existing share-
holders. This must be a rather broad
statement because Caltex is an “existing
shareholder” and as a result of the For-
mation Agreement it is able to take up,
at the same price as the Boral shares are
being offered elsewhere, up to 40 p.c. of
the total shares to be issued.
Caltex exercised this right at the time
of the Huddart Parker takeover but not
at the time of the Mount Lyell Invest-
ments takeover. It may well be that the
existence of this agreement in some way
accounts for the substantial cash content
of the recent bids by Boral. If Caltex
decides to take up its entitlement, Boral
is assured of an immediate buyer (at a
high price) for the capital that must be
issued to obtain the cash.
TTowever. judging by the balance sheet
at June 30, 1963, the company had
sufficient funds available in liquid assets
(“Cash on Deposit, at Bank and on
Hand” and “Investments listed on a
prescribed Stock Exchange”) to meet the
cash portion of the offers for Mount Lyell
Investments and Gas Supply Co. and the
possibility of all the shareholders in the
offeree companies requiring cash had
been covered by overdraft arrangements
with the National Bank.
Clearly it becomes necessary to try and
assess the likely effect of these takeovers
which, in addition to the allotment of
nearly £1.7 million in share capital
(worth about £8.5 million even at 255.
per share), will require the disbursement
of nearly £2.5 million in cash.
Looking at the Mount Lyell Invest-
ments acquisition on the basis of the
balance sheet at December 31, 1962, this
company had cash assets sufficient to
provide nearly 80 p.c. of the total cash
requirement of the two takeovers (Mount
Lyell Investments and Gas Supply Co).
The dividend income from unlisted in-
vestments amounted to £224,000 and
while it is necessary to guess at the likely
dividend income from listed securities,
since the bulk of these investments had
been made at the end of the 1962 year,
a total dividend income of £330,000 from
all investments seems likely.
So far as the Gas Supply Co is con-
cerned, earnings of £198,000 (before
preference dividend, as the preference
capital is also being acquired) will be
obtained.
Tt therefore appears at first glance that
A for an issue of £1.7 million, earnings
of, say, £530,000 have been obtained,
which represents an earning rate of over
31 p.c. This is therefore an attractive
situation by itself. If it is considered that
the earnings of Gas Supply Co. have been
increasing over the last few years at the
average annual compound rate of 84 p.c.
and the dividend income of Mount Lyell
Investments at about 5 p.c. then the take-
overs are well justified purely as invest-
ments.
If we put all the investment income to-
gether we arrive at a figure of £760,000,
which would be sufficient to pay a divid-
end of 124 p.c.. on the total capital after
100 p.c. acquisition of both Mount Lyell
Investments and Gas Supply Co.
In these circumstances it is hardly
necessary to mention the other benefits
that will flow to Boral from these ac-
quisitions. There can be little doubt that
over the last four years at least, Boral
has become concerned to ensure outlets
for its various products. This is evidenced
by the acquisition of the road surfacing
business of BHP By-Products Pty Ltd,
the association with Reids Quarries in
Reid Bros and Carr Pty Ltd, and the
association with Ready Mixed Concrete
in Bitumax Ltd in South Australia.
The acquisition of Gas Supply Co.
gives Boral an outlet for liquified petrol-
eum gas and the Mount Lyell Investment
acquisition gives substantial shareholdings
in four fertiliser companies, probably
sufficiently large to influence their choice
of suppliers.
It was mentioned earlier that existing
shareholders had not participated to any
great extent in the large increase in cap-
ital which has and will take place. Never-
theless, shareholder benefits have still
been quite substantial mainly as a result
of increases in the dividend rate. The
following table shows shares held and
dividend income therefrom arising from
an investment made in 1953.
Par Value of Dividend

1961 1,197 207
1962 1,197 209
1963 1,197 239
This table makes it clear that over a
period of 10 years dividend income has
doubled. It is only reasonable to point
out that, despite this, the 1962/63 divi-
dend was covered over 1.6 times and
that even with the new issues it would
seem that a 20 p.c. dividend should still
be covered at least this number of times.
However, one must point out also that
the rate of growth in dividend income is
not so dramatic over the last eight years.
On this record one would hesitate to sug-
gest a future growth rate in excess of
4 p.c. whereas on the present price of
28s. 6d. one would have preferred to see
a rate of growth of the order of 6 p.c.
I would regard Boral’s shares as a good
investment but perhaps fully priced at
present.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Making the Run Against Imports
npHE chairman of Olympic Consolidated
Industries Ltd (Mr I. F. Beaure-
paire) reported in his review of 1962-63
group activities that increased imports
were affecting both the tyre and general
products business.
Mr Beaurepaire observed that higher
wages and longer holidays, if unaccom-
panied by increased productivity, would
add to the cost disadvantages of Austra-
lian manufacturers in relation to over-
seas competitors.
Olympic’s management has made rep-
resentations for adequate tariff protection
to the authorities. Purchase of imported
goods by Government departments and
instrumentalities, where Australian-made
goods were available, also caused direc-
tors concern.
Inadequate tariff protection, higher
operating costs and the slow recovery in
the building trade contributed to a trad-
ing deficit in the general products di-
vision. Presumably the main trouble was
in the floor coverings field (vinyl and
rubber tiles). Mr Beaurepaire said de-
mand for these products and the laying
service was improving.
Other products handled by this di-
vision are conveyor belting, polyurethane
foam, footwear, thermal and low-tem-
perature insulating materials.
Despite a loss in general products
trading, the company turned in a record
profit of £1,603,068 (compared with
£1,536,314 in 1961-62) for the year
to June. The depreciation charge was
down from £944,326 to £918,858, but
the provision for taxation was increased
from £1,196,211 to £1,245,161.
Earning rate was a very satisfactory
20.3 p.c., giving double cover for the
10 p.c. dividend. Profit was also after
£90,000 (previously £100,000) pro-
vision for contingencies, including long-
service leave and obsolescence of fixed
assets.
The accounts reveal continuation of a
very satisfactory liquid position. Long-
term liabilities mainly comprise
£3,113,869 in registered unsecured
notes. Profit covered the note interest 12
times.
Uncompleted contracts for capital ex-
penditure amounted to £170,167, which
should not strain the working capital
position.
Plant and equipment of subsidiaries
has been written down by £500,000
which came from the £330,000 standing
in the provision for obsolescence at June
30, 1962, £20,000 from current profits
and £150,000 from unappropriated pro-
fits.
Although the Australian market is a
growing one, as illustrated in the
accompanying graph, it is already very
competitive, and will become more so.
Olympic is therefore placing greater
emphasis on product development and
quality control.
Existing Olympic tyre plants are
located at West Footscray (Vic.) and
Geebung (Q’ld).
Until three years ago the Australian
tyre and tube market was divided
amongst Olympic, Dunlop, Goodyear
and Hardie (H. C. Sleigh subsidiary).
Then B. F. Goodrich (Goodrich of USA
and Ampol) began manufacturing tyres
and batteries. Now SA Rubber Holdings
(with United States Rubber Co.) will
enter the tyre field when a plant is
established at South Salisbury (SA).
In part answer to the new com-
petition, Olympic and Dunlop are com-
bining forces for the production of tyres
at Elizabeth (SA) and O'Connor, near
Fremantle (WA).
The Beaurepaire Tyre Service dis-
tributes Olympic tyres and batteries
throughout 100 major branches and
hundreds of authorised dealers.
Another associated interest is pursued
with Dunlop and Ralph Mcßay Ltd, in
the production of truck wheels and rims
by Wheels and Rims (Aust.) Pty, at
Maidstone (Vic.). This investment is not
yet returning anything to Olympic.
The other major activity of the group
is in cables, which are produced at
Tottenham (Vic.) and Geebung (Q’ld),
for home, office, factory, government
services or industrial needs. The Totten-
ham plant is being provided with greater
facilities. The chairman reported that
the Australian cable industry is now
obtaining more raw materials from local
sources. Aluminium is being used
increasingly as a conductor for high-
voltage overhead power reticulation, Mr
Beaurepaire said.
Since formation of the holding com-
pany in 1953, shareholders have received
a regular 9 p.c. dividend, lifted to 10 p.c.
in the last two years. A l-for-10 par
issue in 1960-61 has been the only capital
benefit, but shares have been issued to
take over other businesses and to the
superannuation fund.
Olympic’s efforts to diversify have
been reasonably successful, but the basic
business is still tyres and cables. Should
the tyre and associated business become
extremely competitive there could be
even closer alliance with Dunlop.
Trading for the first quarter of 1963-
64 has been at record levels, though
group profit is estimated to be lower
than in the previous corresponding
period.
The write-off of obsolete plant belong-
ing to the general products division was
a non-recurring item and has proved to
be a prudent measure. This division
should show a marked improvement in
profitability during 1963-64.
The stock has been a dependable
investment, largely for income. At
11s. 9d. the 5s. units are about the
lowest they have been this year (peak,
14s. 6d.), but almost equal to last year’s
peak.
There is no particular reason to jump
into this stock at the present time.

AUSTRALIAN GYPSUM INDUSTRIES
Plastered in Good Company
An 11 p.c. increase in the number of
building permits issued for homes
and flats was almost exactly paralleled
by the 12 p.c. sales increase recorded
by Australian Gypsum Industries Ltd.
Net profit of this Melbourne-based
gypsum and plaster miller likewise rose
11 p.c. from £453,490 to £505,171
after providing £394,967 (up £70,949)
for tax and £309,872 (up £20,635) for
depreciation in the year to June 30 last.
Earning rate of 17.6 p.c. gives more
generous cover for the steady 10 p.c.
dividend than since formation of the
present company in October, 1960, by
the amalgamation of Australian Gypsum
Ltd, The Victor Electric Plaster Mills
Ltd and Peninsula Plaster Co. Ltd.
These three companies were share-
holders having respective interests of
40 p.c., 40 p.c. and 20 p.c. in the operat-
ing company, Australian Gypsum Prod-
ucts Pty, whose accounts are summarised
in the accompanying table to compare
with the new group.
In August, 1959, the proprietary com-
pany made a bonus of one-for-one, which
was copied by each of the public holding
companies.
Dividends totalling £275,000 (twice
the previous payout) were distributed
from 1959-60 profits of the private com-
pany to enable the public holding com-
panies to maintain a dividend of 10 p.c.
on their doubled capitals.
Late in 1960 shareholders of the three
companies received four ss. shares in
Australian Gypsum Industries for each
20s. share formerly held, plus cash pay-
ments of lOd. for each Australian Gyp-
sum share, 11s. 3d. for each Victor, and
2s 2.7 d. for each Peninsula share.
In May, 1961, the new company allot-
ted £250,000 in ss. shares at 7s. pre-
mium to The British Plaster Board
(Holdings) Ltd, which agreed to provide
for the free exchange of research and
development information and for the use
of patents.
The British company is the largest
producer of gypsum and plaster products
in the UK, with many overseas sub-
sidiaries. The £600,000 received by Aus-
tralian Gypsum for the share allotment
was used for general expansion of the
group’s operations.
Activities of the major subsidiaries in
the group during 1962-63 were:
Australian Plaster Industries’ new
plaster mill at Port Melbourne made a
satisfactory contribution to group profit.
Victor plaster board was introduced to
the NSW market, and is gaining greater
acceptance for the interior lining of Aus-
tralian homes.
Waratah Gypsum Pty, which supplies
SA gypsum almost exclusively to cement
manufacturers, effected shipments to
Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and
Malaya, as well as to the associated
NZ company. The port of Thevenard
may be improved shortly.
Insulwool Products Pty sold more in-
sulation materials, and acoustical prod-
ucts were again in demand for commer-
cial buildings and institutions.
Bellco Pty’s chalk products were im-
proved in quality by a new production
method.
Bellco Controls Pty, manufacturing
and distributing switches and timing de-
vices, developed its business.
Victor Plasters Ltd, NZ (half-owned),
benefited for the full year from the new
Christchurch plaster mill. The main mill
at Auckland continued operations at a
steady rate.
As the major producer of plaster and
plaster products in Australia, the group
is not greatly troubled by competition.
Ably managed, with overseas technical
liaison, its profitability largely depends on
the state of the economy generally, with
particular emphasis on the housing in-
dustry.
As more funds are now available to
finance home construction, directors are
hopeful of an even stronger demand for
the company’s products in 1963-64.
The present group and its predecessor
managed company finances without re-
course to long-term loan capital or share-
holders’ assistance. Investors can con-
fidently expect a steady lOp.c. dividend
and further bonus issues from time to
time.
At 17s. the 5s. shares yield 2.9 p.c.,
so at that level they will only appeal
to the genuine long-term investor. If the
market recedes generally, opportunities
may occur at a later date to enter this
admirable stock more cheaply.

BENNETT AND WOOD LTD
Streamlining a Prestige Float
T)ennett and Wood Ltd has taken
longer than expected to settle down
after its move from the main site in the
centre of Sydney to new premises at Zet-
land and the moving of some of the
branch stores.
Now that the relocations are complete,
the current year should see a substantial
boost in business and profit.
The company began in 1882 selling
bicycles and accessories. It still has a
big business in Speedwell bicycles but
has become one of the largest distributors
of motor parts and accessories, garage
equipment and motor cycles and parts in
New South Wales.
It holds agencies for Nasco, Ford and
Lucas parts as well as for BSA and
Honda motor cycles and scooters.
It has branches in Goulburn, Lismore,
Newcastle, Orange, Tamworth, Parra-
matta, Wagga, St Leonards and Wollon-
gong and several years ago also opened
branches in Canberra and Brisbane.
In late 1961, the store in the centre of
Sydney was sold and the business moved
to Zetland. This resulted in greater effi-
ciency despite a sizeable reduction in
staff.
Sales for the latest 12 months to June
showed a 13 p.c. increase to £3,6 mil-
lion over the previous year. Results were
affected by temporary dislocation of trade
following the moving of some branches,

losses of about £19.000 from bad debts
and losses on writing down of obsolete
stock.
Now that the major moves have been
completed, stock obsolescence will prob-
ably be much less than in 1963, while
greater efficiency should also keep the
bad debts position to a minimum.
A data processing unit installed over a
year ago will also enable management to
keep stricter control.
The current year has started well with
sales up 83 p.c. With the prospect of a
sizeable increase, in turnover for the full
12 months, profit should show a marked
improvement.
Concurrently with the move to new
premises, balance date has been altered
from February 28 to June 30. Thus the
£35,572 profit for the 16 months to June
last was equal to 6.6 p.c. on capital or
4.7 p.c. if calculated on an annual basis.
The 8 p.c. dividend paid for the period
was actually sent out in the 12 months to
February, with no payment being made
for the extra four months to June 30.
Thus the distribution if calculated on an
annual basis becomes 6 p.c.
Expenditure on the new country pre-
mises during the period totalled £109,975.
This was more than covered by the sale
of old properties which brought in
£149,500.
Other developments at suburban
branches were financed by an 8-year de-
velopment loan of £lOO,OOO from the
company’s bankers and loans from the
City Mutual Life.
At June 30, bank term loans totalled
£102,206, with £14,706 repayable within
12 months, while the City Mutual loans
totalled £218,500 (£lB,OOO due in 12
months).
The accounts show that the company
appears to be prepared to cope with the
greater business expected. Stocks are up
from £984,901 16 months earlier to
£1,089,265, while trade debtors are up
from £563,875 to £632,558.
Partly as a result of the build-up in
stocks, trade creditors are up from
£363,273 to £620,098. Overdraft shows
a reduction from £273,473 to £217,680.
Deposits repayable within 12 months are
down from £141,150 to £30,050.
Despite the new premises, most of the
group’s land and buildings still appear in
the books at 1955 valuation, with addi-
tions to February 28, 1962, at cost.
Capital is still unchanged at the
£562,636 with which the company came
on to the Stock Exchange list in 1955
after a placement of 100,000 10s. shares
at 255. 6d.
Reserves and surplus profit totalling
£990,355, including £210,041 of a capital
nature, give a solid backing to capital.
Net tangible assets backing for each 10s.
share is 275. 7d.
The shares are currently selling around
11s. 6d. half the original issue price
and considerably below the assets value
— to show a dividend yield on an annual
basis of 5.2 p.c.
Although the going will not be easy in
the coming months, the more streamlined
Bennett and Wood could start to live up
to some of the high hopes indicated by
the big premium placed on the initial
float.

JAMES STEDMAN LTD
A Fully Valued Chocolatier
Tames Stedman Ltd, self-styled manu-
** facturing confectioner and choco-
latier, seems bent on a programme of
more generous treatment to shareholders.
Since the company was ousted by Life-
savers Australasia Ltd in a bid to take
over Smalls Chocolate Holdings Ltd in
June, 1962, Stedman has looked more to
its public image.
A share split and a lift in dividend
from 10 p.c. to 12} p.c. and currently
13i p.c. suggest the old conservative
policies have been overruled.
Tax provision of <£.205,380 bears the
normal relation to after-tax profit of
£299,221 in the year to June 30, 1963,
whereas in the first two years that tax
provision was disclosed (1959-60 and
1960-61) tax closely approximated the
disclosed net profit.
The present holding company was
formed in October, 1959, by exchange
of two new shares for each old one held
in James Stedman Henderson’s Sweets
Ltd. That company was formed by a
merger in 1920. Until the 1959 capital
reconstruction, there were no capital
changes.
The organisation has an unbroken
record of annual profits and dividends
going back to at least 1933. Since 1951
dividends of no less than 10 p.c. have
been paid.
A high degree of liquidity is a feature
of the accounts, there being no over-
draft or long-term liabilities. Very con-
siderable sums are invested in bonds,
debentures and equities. (Present market
value of listed securities does not reveal
any great surplus over cost).

£117,280 standing to the credit of pro-
vision for exchange fluctuations account
is sufficient to reduce to par value of ex-
change the company’s investments out-
side Australia.
Stedman has two*plants one on 121
acres at Rosebery, NSW, and a new one
on 6 acres in Avondale, a suburb of
Auckland (NZ). The Rosebery freehold
land and buildings were revalued in 1961.
The company has a good range of con-
fectionery, the best known lines being
Minties, Jaffas, Fantales and Throaties.
Most lines are marketed under the brand
name of “Sweetacres”. The Nestle Co.
(Aust.) Ltd acts as selling agent for Sted-
mans throughout Australasia.
In the face of strong competition sales
were increased during 1962-63. Direc-
tors said in their annual report that the
NZ increase in sales was effected mainly
through the chain stores.
Prices of the main raw materials were
fairly stable in Australia throughout the
year, but in NZ five rises in the price of
sugar totalling £NZS2 per ton occurred
between January and June 1963. Prices
are still £2O per ton above the level ruling
on December 31 and are about £A11
higher than in Australia.
At 22s. 6d. the 5s. shares yield a tiny
2.8 p.c. Although Stedman may augment
the dividend to 15 p.c. this year, no
other early benefits can be counted on.
The shares look very fully valued for the
present.

C. V. HOLLAND HOLDINGS LTD
A Strong Bonus Prospect?
ITolden distributors are traditionally
high profit earners and Sydney-
based C. V. Holland Holdings Ltd is no
exception to this rule.
The company floated in 1953 with a
paid-up capital of £lOO,OOO under the
name of C. V. Holland (Finance) Ltd to
finance the business of C. V. Holland
Pty in particular, and conduct hire-
purchase business in general.
However, in 1955, it acquired the pro-
prietary company with its General
Motors franchise for the Holden,
Chevrolet and Pontiac, changing its
name to the present C. V. Holland Hold-
ings Ltd. The principal activity of the
group thus became the sale and distribu-
tion of Holden vehicles.
The finance activities were floated off
as a separate entity, Southern Advances
Ltd, in which the group held a large but
not major interest.
Southern Advances remained a partly-
owned subsidiary until 1961, when it
was acquired by Astor Hotel Motel Ltd
by an exchange of shares. The shares
which C. V. Holland received for its
holding appear in the books at £370,000,
slightly above the June 30 market value.
With Astor paying a dividend of 12i
p.c., this holding returned Holland, tax-
free, £43,750 —equal to 14.5 p.c. on
capital and almost sufficient to meet the
15 p.c. payout.
Profit has almost doubled from the low
point, as a distributor, of £61,737 in
1959 to a record £116,429 in the latest
year. As capital has remained unchanged
at £300,000 in ss. ordinary shares since
the one-for-two cash issue in 1956, earn-
ing rate has climbed from 20.6 p.c. in
1959 to last year’s 38.9 p.c.
Dividends have absorbed considerably
less than half the profit (12i p.c. for the
two years prior to last year’s 15 p.c.)
with large sums being ploughed back
into the group.
This has been partly reflected in the
growth of fixed assets through the open-
ing of new showrooms, but reserves
have also risen strongly and at £446,865
subject to intangible items of £90,098
give a solid backing to capital. Net back-
ing for each 5s. share is 10s. lid.
With earning rate at such a high
figure and with every prospect for an-
other increase in the current year,
despite strong competition from Ford
and BMC, the company must be con-
sidered a strong bonus prospect.
Fixed assets appear in the books at
cost and with even a modest write-up
could provide a basis for a one-for-three
bonus with little danger to the present
dividend and earning rate.
The shares are currently selling around
15s. to show a dividend yield of 5 p.c.
and an earnings yield of 12.9 p.c. At
these levels they appear underpriced.

GERRARD CO. of AUSTRALASIA
Good to Have and Hold
ly! anagement of the Melbourne wire
and engineering group, Gerrard Co.
of Australasia Ltd, have had their re-
ward for putting their house in order
the satisfaction of seeing the company
shake off depression ills.
Although pre-recession earning rates
have not yet been restored, the profit of
£303,103 was an all-time record.
Members of the household are: Ger-
rard Wire Tying Machines Co. Pty of
Melbourne, Gerrard Wire Tying Mach-
ines (NZ) Ltd, Fielding Springs Pty and
Spring Replacements Pty of Melbourne,
Gerrard Springs (NZ) Ltd, Patterson
Engineering Pty and Mildura Motors,
both of Mildura (Vic.), J. Sankey
Robinson of Adelaide, and Westons Pty
of Sydney.
The company set about remarshalling
its assets, and so far has sold three sur-
plus properties, negotiations for the sale
of three more are in the final stages, and
only one more has to be sold. A capital
profit of £18,837 has resulted to date.
Those subsidiaries which were un-
profitable in 1962 were reviewed. Patter-
son Engineering returned to profitable
operations, and directors expect this to
be a permanent recovery.
Daniel Harvey was sold early in 1963,
and the chairman described this as “an
important milestone" in his recent
address to shareholders.
Major contributions to the record
profit were from the tensional strapping
and coil spring manufactured by Field-
ing Springs, increasingly good results
from the steel merchant business of J.
Sankey Robinson and the packaging
supply business of Westons Pty.
Westons moved during 1962-63 into
new warehouse, factory and offices next
to Gerrard Wire Tying Machines at
Mascot (NSW), and now has room to
expand.
Gerrard Springs (NZ) Ltd operated
for a full twelve months, and directors
believe this venture in the NZ spring
business and the new spring factory at
Penrose was thoroughly worthwhile.
They are also confident about the sub-
stantial minority shareholding in Pitt
Waddell Bennett Chains Pty.
These economies and a steadily ad-
vancing turnover provided substantial
stimulus to profits, and while present
trading conditions continue, directors be-
lieve 1963 results will be equally good.
The company was unlucky that a
period of planned growth and diversifica-
tion coincided with the economic restric-
tions imposed by the Government in
1960. After two troubled years it has
now reasserted itself as a fine second-
rank stock.
Liquidity is now high, the working capi-
tal ratio being a healthy 2$ to 1, so
no cash issue is likely. The last two
issues to shareholders were a one-for-
four at 50 p.c. premium and a one-for-
four at 25 p.c. premium, both in 1960-
61.
Capital expanded rapidly in the last
three years also by virtue of a placement
and several issues to vendors of compan-
ies acquired by the group.
Management will be anxious to
consolidate reserves—they are now al-
most equal to paid capital—in the im-
mediate future, but eventually, if the high
earning rates of the old days can be re-
captured, shareholders can reasonably
expect some capital benefit.
The 10s. shares at about 25s. 9d. show
an income return of 4.9 p.c. and earn-
ings yield of 7.2 p.c., and in the present
strong market Gerrard stock looks good
to have and to hold.

PITT, SON AND BADGERY LTD
A Solid Woolbroker
wool prices and increased turn-
over of sheep and cattle sales, both
in number and value, resulted in a good
trading year for Pitt, Son and Badgery
Ltd in 1962-63, although the wool clip
handled was smaller than for 1961-62.
Net profit increased from £71,630 to
£106,740, reviving earning rate from 14.4
to 15.9 p.c.
It has a record of continuous profit
and dividends since at least 1929. Four-
teen bonus share issues have been made
since 1915, the last being a one-for-two
in 1950 and a one-for-twenty in 1957.
The only call on shareholders for funds
has been the 1957 note issue which con-
verted to share capital on January 1,
1963.
Dividends of 13 p.c. have been paid
for the last five years, of which 8 p.c. is
basic and 5 p.c. bonus.
During the year to June 30, 1963, a
branch was opened at Nvngan and a
subsidiary formed to buy an old stock
and station agency at Cooma.
The generally good season in NSW
strengthened the demand for rural pro-
perties, which were bringing prices equal
to or better than any previous peak. The
US demand for beef and mutton was
also bringing stability to prices, the chair-
man told shareholders at the annual
meeting.
The 10s. shares at 26s. give a fair
average return of 5 p.c. for such a solid
member of the woolbroking and stock
and station fraternity.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND
Freedom for Pigs Again
All animals are equal, but ...
After much huffing and puffing the
Australian pig industry has blown
down all but the last of the barriers that
have paralysed it for more than three
years.
Any day now Victoria is expected to
lift its ban on the importation of pigs and
pigmeat from New South Wales. Once
again the country’s pigs will be as free to
move as their masters.
The freedom will bring relief from
restrictions that have walled off States
against each other in the moving of pigs
dead or alive, and even, in the case of
New South Wales, divided a State into
safe and unsafe zones.
Last to be demolished, Victoria’s wall
was the first to be erected when swine
fever, dreaded by pigmen around the
world, broke out in New South Wales
in 1960. The Department of Agriculture
in that State swooped, slaughtering entire
piggeries where there was the slightest
chance that contact had been made with
the disease. Since then the number of
pigs sacrificed to the campaign of con-
tainment has run into tens of thousands,
and many small farmers have been
plunged into ruin.
Soon after the New South Wales out-
break, suspicion flared in Victoria when
tests showed that pigs on two farms in
this State possessed a degree of resistance
to swine fever, suggesting they may have
been exposed to it in some way. These
piggeries were slaughtered out and New
South Wales promptly reciprocated Vic-
toria’s action by banning its pigs and pig-
meat. Other States followed by barring
the entry of pigs and pigmeats from the
two infected States.
\7ictoria has had further scares since
" then, but no actual cases. Its only two
annihilations did not cost it more than
about 700 pigs.
Last May the thaw began when
Queensland lifted its embargo on Vic-
torian pigs, applied in December, 1961.
Queensland maintained the ban against
New South Wales, its only concession to
that State being to let Victorian pigs cross
it to reach Queensland provided they took
the shortest route and were not unloaded
in transit.
At the time, the Victorian Department
of Agriculture could not get its New
South Wales counterpart to say whether
it would let Victorian pigs traverse it en
route to Queensland, but one breeder, Mr
N. A. Hamblin, of Tooleen, the first Vic-
torian to send pigs to Queensland for
three years, rose above the uncertainty
by consigning some Large Black sows
and a boar to Cairns by air.
New South Wales did not take Queens-
land’s cue, but relented a fraction to
allow Victorian stud pigs into the State
provided they were accompanied by the
normal certificate of health that is re-
quired whether a ban is on or not.
There was nothing official about this.
A New South Wales breeder simply
sought permission to import some Vic-
torian pigs, was surprised when it was
granted, and others followed suit. An
officer of the Victorian Department of
Agriculture said last week that he would
be surprised if commercial pigs and pig-
meats were not also going across the
Murray from Victoria.
A lthough New South Wales has shown
such leniencies under the counter,
the reluctance of its Department of Agri-
culture to clarify policies has puzzled
officials in other States.
For the purpose of controlling the
disease, New South Wales was divided
into zones the North Coast Protected
Area and the rest of the State. Pigs and
pigmeats have not been allowed into the
North Coast area from outside. At the
same time, the New South Wales author-
ities have continued to ask Victoria to
drop its ban on their pigs. Victorian
officials and industry organisations have
refused to do so while New South Wales,
by retaining its protected area, acknowl-
edges that the risk of infection still exists
elsewhere in the State.
Pressure for preserving the protected
area has been strong from North Coast
pig-raisers who send their stock across
the border into Queensland for killing.
They did not want to give Queensland
any excuse for blocking them from the
market in the same way as Riverina pig
producers lost access to their traditional
Victorian markets by the southern State’s
embargo and had to scratch for other
outlets at the cost of substantial price
drops.
Now, however, come reports that the
protected area’s ban on imports has been
lifted. Again, the information came not
through official channels but from an
officer of the Victorian Department of
Agriculture who happened to spot a news
item to this effect in a New South Wales
farming journal. The Victorian depart-
ment is trying to get confirmation from
New South Wales. If removal of the ban
becomes official, the Victorian depart-
ment is expected then to clear away the
last obstruction by removing the ban
against New South Wales.
Other States that have recently lifted
bans against Victoria are South Australia,
Western Australia and Tasmania. South
Australia and Tasmania have also lifted
bans on New South Wales.
HThe restrictions that have blocked off
the various States have probably had
more effect on pigmeats than live pigs,
impairing the flexibility of processors
accustomed to juggling supply and de-
mand on an interstate scale to smooth
out irregularities in production and
marketing.
Victoria and New South Wales are the
two biggest pig States, with Queensland,
which exports most of its produce, close
behind. Trade in pigs and pigmeats be-
tween the two runs in no particular direc-
tion, but ebbs and flows according to
economic and productive tides.
One effect of the last two years’ stag-
nation was the spectacular influx of New
Zealand pigmeats, imports of which
jumped from eight tons in 1961-62 to
1900 tons in 1962-63. The imports were
mostly made by processors in New South
Wales who could not get enough supplies
in their own State and could not go out-
side it. After a flurry among producers
processors gave an assurance that the im-
ports were in the nature of an emergency
and would be marketed in such a way
as not to disrupt local prices.
New Zealand had the market cornered
because Australia’s quarantine laws pro-
hibit imports of fresh and frozen pig-
meats from countries other than it.
The prospect of a return to freedom in
pig trading coincides with predictions of
a ballooning of the country’s pig popula-
tion in response to the coming into adult-
hood of Australia’s postwar crop of
babies. Mr Les Downey, Victorian


Department of Agriculture pig expert,
said recently that by next March the pig
population should be back where it was
two years ago, when 120,000 tons of pig-
meats were produced, and that after that
might go on to set figures that surpass
even the record 127,000 tons turned out
in 1945 as the climax to wartime pro-
duction stimulated by subsidies on stock-
feed provided always that swine fever
does not again turn the industry into a
cripple.
The Buds and the Bees
Trying to avert a “silent Spring ”
Tn Victoria’s Goulburn Valley, where
A orchards sweep across miles of land
made green by irrigation, fruit-growers
seeing the buds on their trees swelling
ready to break into pink had only to ring
a number and along would come a truck-
load of bees to fertilise the flowers by
carrying pollen from one to another.
This year, over much of the area, the
phones have been busier than the bees.
Although the orchardists and bee-
keepers need each other on the one
side for pollination, on the other for
nourishing hives on spring blossoms
lack of liaison between the two has
allowed insecticides to come between
them.
The apiarists say that insecticides,
which have been getting deadlier every
year as science pursues the evasions of
the animal kingdom, have helped to kill
about one-third of Victoria’s bee popula-
tion this spring.
Until a few years ago, orchardists
made arrangements for pollination with
individual bee-keepers, but the business
got so big and complex that about four
years ago the apiarists who went in for
selling the business of their bees in the
off-season organised themselves into the
Victorian Pollination Service.
The service has put out as many as
3000 hives a year in the Goulburn and
Murray Valleys. Another group works
in the southern areas around Melbourne
and on the Mornington Peninsula. Thus
unified, the bee-keepers this, year were
able to act as one when the Victorian
Department of Agriculture issued orch-
ardists with new spraying recommenda-
tions that conflicted with the welfare of
the bees.
The department prescribed early spring
spraying against the mealy bug insect
with parathion from pink-bud stage
to petal-fall. An organic phosphate,
parathion is one of the deadliest
chemicals used in agriculture. Humans
have died from getting it on their skin.
The department’s advice meant drench-
ing the orchard foliage with this poison
just when the bees would be droning
among it, cross-pollinating. There were
other recommendations, less perilous to
bees, for such pests as light brown apple
moth and green peach aphis.
The fruit-growers went ahead with
plans for putting on the sprays without a
word to the apiarists. When the bee men
learned about this in their own way, they
decided to boycott the Goulburn Valley
unless the orchardists agreed not to use
the dangerous materials. Only in the face
of the deadlock that threatened did the
two sides meet on a problem that ought
to have brought them together much
sooner.
Growers, together with representatives
of the canneries who take their fruit,
conferred with the president of the Vic-
torian Pollination Service, Mr E. A.
McKenna, of Shepparton. The result of
the meeting was divided. On the eastern
side of the Goulburn River, where fruit
goes mostly to the Shepparton cannery,
growers were sufficiently averse to the
prospect of losing the bees to make their
spraying programmes safe for them.
Mealy bug is their worst pest at this
time, and by far the best treatment for
it is to use parathion during blossoming.
The growers agreed to use safe alterna-
tives during this period and hope that
some effect can be salvaged from
parathion after the bees have gone.
Asked what could be used instead of
parathion, an officer of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture said last week
that sevin was “quite a deterrent” and
diazanon “has some control”. DDT is
another widely-used pesticide that does
not harm bees.
On the other side of the river, where
the Ardmona cannery reigns, growers
were sympathetic to the bee men’s case
but thought they had left it too late to
expect orchardists to change their spray-
ing programmes for this season. So the
growers went ahead with the application
of parathion and the bee-keepers black-
balled the district. A count showed that
the difference in bee population between
the two sides of the river was in the ratio
of 45 to 1.
Growers on both sides agree that next
year they and the apiarists must meet in
plenty of time to reconcile their in-
terests before spring.
Observers think that in spite of the
willingness to confer, it may not be easy
to find a compromise that will suit both
parties. One reason for doubt is that the
incidence of mealy bug, which concerns
mainly pears, is not widespread and
uniform enough to prompt regional
unanimity among growers. It comes in
what the experts call “spot infestations”,
building up explosively in some orchards
and barely giving others a glance.
It is no goo'd for bee men to make
arrangements with individual growers
because the bees can easily stray into the
orchards of neighbors using parathion.
Another difficulty is the spread of flower-
ing time among different types and
varieties of fruit in the same orchard.
Bees cannot be put in to cross-pollinate
apples, for example, when pears along-
side them are being sprayed.
Pears and apples are the fruits that
stand to suffer most from the loss of the
honey bee. Peaches and William pears
are reasonably self-fertile, but Packhams,
Australia’s main export variety, depend
heavily on cross-pollination. This variety
needs cross-pollination not only to ensure
the setting of fruit but because, by some
botanical whimsy, it is more susceptible
to the bacterial disease syringae when
cross-pollination is inadequate.
If the threat to the bee’s role in hor-
ticulture is grim economically, scientific-
ally there are consolations. Research
workers have seized the unprecedented
opportunity this season of studying the
effect of the bees’ withdrawal from the
Ardmona section of the Goulburn Valley.
They think pear and apple crops could
be lighter, but at this stage will attempt
to predict no figures. The proof will be
in the picking.
Native insects and wild bees will to
some extent “scab” on the striking
mercenaries, but to the orchardist they
are fair-weather friends, working only
when the sun is shining and the breeze
is soft. Introduced bees are essential for
cross-pollination on the duller, less
favorable days. And the wild insects
might not survive for long unless science
calls a truce with nature.
In America it was found that extensive
use of sprays tended to wipe out other
forms of insect life and farmers wanting
crops pollinated had to rely entirely on
imported honey bees. In Utah, where
aerial spraying was killing native insects,
the solution finally adopted was to cul-
tivate untouched roadside strips where
insects could breed up again.
Experts know that a hive of 45,000
bees working on orchards contaminated
with insect poisons can be wiped out
within three weeks. Honey prices have
slumped from what they used to be, but
at this rate of destruction it is doubtful
whether orchardists could afford to make
the hiring of bees profitable as an alter-
native source of income for apiarists.
But many feel no price would be too
high to avert an Australian fulfilment of
the prophecies in American biologist
Rachel Carson’s controversial book,
“Silent Spring”.

Fruits of Hard Work
The future of Australia’s hard-working farmers?
By MARIEL LEE
A lmost alone among the world’s en-
lightened workers those on farms do
not observe a legally determined week.
Seasonal needs rather than regulations
dictate their hours of work.
Hardest working of the world’s hard-
worked farm workers are undoubtedly
Australia’s 393,000 odd highly skilled
and resourceful agricultural work force,
some of whom unflaggingly face tempera-
tures of over one hundred degrees to
wrest a living from country once de-
scribed as unfit for white men. They
have in their time overcome crude
pioneer conditions, and still must battle
with droughts, floods, insect pests,
diseases and soil deficiencies.
By means of better farming methods,
modern machinery, pasture improve-
ments and new scientific findings, Aus-
tralia’s present relatively small agri-
cultural work force now produces more
sheep, wool, meat, wheat, sugar and other
primary products than over 400,000
such workers did in 1949. In the United
States, too, fewer farm workers now
produce more, thanks largely to its
higher natural endowment of regular
rainfall and a huge river network water-
ing most of its farming and grazing lands.
But it is to even more
successful in production against natural
difficulties, that investigators from all
parts of the world come to find out how
a people lacking many natural advan-
tages can still be a world leader in
primary production, as it surprisingly has
become since in 1789 James Ruse, with
his spade and wooden hoe, cultivated a
plot and there grew the first wheat for
an almost starving settlement.
In 1831, when Australia made its
first effective harvesting machine, and
later, in 1843, when its first reaping
machine was used, few were optimistic
enough to dream that the isolated Aus-
tralian colonies would ever produce
surplus wheat, and certainly not so much
of it that, in a much more populous
and still hungry world, disposal of that
surplus would become a major problem.
Yet, with home consumption only
some 50 million bushels, the Australian
Wheat Board, despite its providential
large sales to Communist China, has been
hard put to it to dispose profitably of
last harvest’s 270 million bushels.
Graver problems must be posed by
future bumper harvests as, with closer
settlement, new areas being brought
under cultivation, and more and more
graziers growing some wheat to augment
their declining wool incomes, Australia’s
wheat production continues to increase.
Woolgrowers face a similar problem.
Australia’s flocks, which produce some
of the world’s finest wools, have also
increased vastly since in 1805 Macarthur
first ran his few merinos on his 5000-
acre grant. From an average of 107.1
million in the 1946-7 to 1950-1 period,
Australian sheep numbers have risen
to 157 million. They are still rising,
though returns from wool are seriously
threatened by advances in synthetics.
This threat is, to some extent, met by the
Australian Wool Board’s more intensive
promotion campaign and by finding new
uses for wool which, non-inflammable, is
the safe textile fibre, usable for floor-
coverings and furnishings as well as for
clothing.
Even so, maintaining an economic
return from wool in the face of growing
competition from synthetics remains a
grave and pressing problem. Any steep
rise in raw wool prices could dis-
astrously lessen demand for it. Japan,
now Australia’s best wool customer and,
with United States’ aid, a world com-
petitor in wool manufacture, is also
increasing its production of synthetics.
Price, then, can be the determining
factor in the relative sales of woollen
and synthetic fabrics.
Australia is also producing more beef,
mutton and lamb, of which sales to the
United States increased from 76,000 tons
in 1960-61 to 151,000 tons in 1961-62.
Who can say how much the United
States demand for Australian meat will
increase, or even how long that demand
can be maintained? Australia would be
wise to increase her chilled beef trade
with Britain, and develop alternative
markets for her growing meat pro-
duction. Again, how and where can she?
For, as yet, her hard-working farmers
have only begun the development of
Australia's vast potential production.
Even though a great deal of Australia’s
inland is one-third desert and one-third
semi-desert, that land needs only water
to make it productive. Already experi-
ments have proved that, given a regular
water supply, perhaps by further ex-
ploiting artesian sources, almost any-
thing can be grown, and grown well, in
Australia’s “dead heart”. There is
already promise that atomic power
stations can produce needed water by
converting salt water into fresh.
