The Red Page
“The Brethren of the Coast”
Most of us start life as buccaneers, pirates,
highwaymen or bushrangers and gradually
tone down, as the years roll on, into sober,
sedate bankers, bishops or churchwardens.
None the less, the old love is never entirely
lost, and any authentic record that throws
light on the deeds of our one-time heroes at
once appeals to such remnants of the early
fires as still smoulder. So the present writer
feels deeply indebted to Philip Gosse, who,
in “The Pirates’ Who’s Who,” has refurbished
certain romantic reputations and rescued
others from an undeserved ignominy. The
record is a long one, and includes names of
all sorts and sizes, from Drake and Hawkins
and Kidd and Sir Henry Morgan down to
a poor negro who was hanged (after a most
exemplary repentance) on his native
Jamaica, and Mrs. llon-cho-Lo, an admiral
over sixty junks, who was “young and pretty,
but also a thoroughgoing murderess.” For
piracy has been by no means the monopoly
of the male sex; several ladies of valor and
enterprise have distinguished themselves
greatly under the Death’s Head and Cross-
bones. Take the case of Anne Bonny—
County Cork her birthplace, her father a
lawyer. Anne, in company with Mary Read,
“fought gallantly in her final action till taken
prisoner.” Both these Amazons bitterly “re-
proached their male companions with their
cowardly conduct in surrendering.” When
Anne’s lover, a certain Rackam, or Rack-
ham, also a pirate, was to be hanged, she
let him go to "the gallows with this cheerful
adjuration: “She was sorry to see him there,
but if he had fought like a man he need not
have been hanged like a dog.” It is con-
soling to learn that both Mary and Anne
escaped the gallows.
It is a great mistake to imagine that the
buccaneer was always a bloodthirsty villain,
regardless of honor or reputation. The
famous Sir Henry Morgan brought an action
for libel against Crooke, the publisher of a
“History of the Buccaneers of America,” with
the result that Crooke paid £2OO damages
to Morgan and published a long and grovel-
ling apology. Morgan was angered not so
much at the tales of dishonesty and vio-
lence as at the stafemen't that he had been
kidnapped in Wales as a boy and sent to be a
slave in Barbadoes. Incidentally, a sur-
prising number of indubitable pirates have
hailed from Wales. Gosse asks pertinently
what has become of this wild Welsh blood.
Perhaps finance or politics has sucked it in.
For instance —but, no ; the elections are over.
Here and there it is the buccaneer who'
stands out as a proven martyr. The famous
Captain Kidd, who was hanged at Tilbury
for piracy and murder, was one. With re-
gard to the piracy, Kidd alleged that two
documents which he had taken out of the
captured ships in question proved that these
vessels were sailing under commissions issued
by the French East India Company, which
made them lawful prizes. But the docu-
ments could not be produced at the trial,
so Kidd was duly swung in chains. Only
lately these two documents, so vital to Kidd,
were discovered in the Public Records
Office —200 years too late to help him. Is
it too late to canonise him?
The French buccaneer Captain Misson
was perhaps the most remarkable man
evolved by the profession. Misson was a
pirate idealist who, with his friend and
lieutenant, a Dominican priest called Carac-
cioli, determined to combine piracy with a
noble attempt to uplift mankind and shake
off the “yoak of tyranny” and get rid of
“oppression and poverty.” He designed a
white ensign with the motto “For God and
Liberty” embroidered upon it. He captured
an English vessel, took out of it 17 pun-
cheons of rum, embraced the captain and
set his prize and her astounded crew at
liberty. He was bitterly opposed to slavery,
and set numbers of negroes free. Eventually
Misson founded an idealist settlement,
Libertatia, on .a Madagascar bay—a Utopia
that flourished for four years, till an attack
by hostile natives, followed by a fierce hur-
ricane, put an end to the adventure. Mis-
son was drowned.
Generally, the pirates did not love to be
called so, but alluded politely -to themselves
as “brethren of the coast.” The weak point
in their ships was the lack of discipline. No
captain could be sure of his command or
his crew. If the men disapproved of what
he did, he was put in chains or flung over-
board. One ship had 13 commanders in a
few months. Pirate Roberts, with four years
to his credit, holds the record. He must
have been a notable man. Captain Teach
was a disciplinarian who held a little party
in his cabin, during which he blew out the
candle and in the dark fired his pistols
under the table, explaining later that “if
he did not shoot one of them now and then
they’d forget who he was.”
But we are forgetting Mrs. llon-cho-Lo.
She was the widow of a noted pirate killed
in 1921. Mrs. Lo “became the terror of the
countryside about Pakhoi.” and was admiral
of some Sixty ocean-going junks. During
the late revolution Mrs. Lo joined General
Wong-Mi n -Tong’s forces, and was ranked
as full colonel. Her specialty was sacking
villages and carrying off young girls to sell
as slaves. In October, 1922, Madame dis-
appeared, leaving a blank in an ancient pro-
fession.
The pride of a pirate was to die game.
Denis McCarthy (hanged at New Providence,
1718) “stood on the gallows bedecked in
colored rifibons (as became an old-time prize-
fighter), and told an admiring audience that
his friends had often told him he would die
in his shoes; and so, to prove them liars,
he kicked off his Shoes among the crowd,
and so died without them.” The clergy
made a specialty of “hanging sermons.” The
prisoner, dressed in his best, would doff his
hat and make a speech, sometimes repentant,
sometimes defiant. The more notorious
pirates were hanged in chains at some place
where ships passed frequently. Our ances-
tors believed in the efficacy of these grim
warnings.
It is interesting to learn that Hyatt Ver-
rill is about to publish a book on the love
affairs of sea-rovers. Several of the lead-
ing buccaneers were conspicuous for a tender
domesticity. Henry Morgan carefully pro-
vided for his widow in his will. Captain
Kidd, resided in N. York, conjugally happy
and respectable. Captain Rackham (“Calico
Jack”), who ran away to sea with Anne
Bonny, lived happily on board ship and on
land with his “spouse,” the couple being
known as Captain and Mrs. Cobham. Cap-
tain Pease carried two wives on his schooner
—one elderly, one young—and contrived to
maintain a surprising family harmony. Mat-
rimony was his strong suit. “But never,”
he said, “take more than two wives on a
voyage, and choose ’em icith care.”

Good Manners and Modern Novels
Nowadays when any Australian author
who writes in a slang that never existed
anywhere save in the Woolloomooloo of his
fancy, or of an Australia that never existed
outside vaudeville, can find at least one
loud enthusiast in print, it is a pity that
so excellent a novel as Acquittal, by
Helen Simpson, a Sydney girl, should pass
almost unnoticed. This is a first novel,
though its author has already published a
book of verse, some one-act plays and the
historical drama “A Man of Hi's Times,”
which the Repertory acted a short while
ago ; but it is surprisingly mature, a very
great advance, technically, on anything else
Miss Simpson has published. There is not
a single hint anywhere of thei dreadful
amateurishness that is the besetting sin of
our emerging prose-literature. It is cer-
tainly the only work by an Australian which
moves in the present area of the serious
novel on the other side—as we have Louis
Stone’s “Jonah” as the sole evidence that
the influences which formed the novel of the
early decades of this century in Europe ever
penetrated here at all.
A clarified grace, a restraint of lialcyonic
wit even where most outrageously daring
in subject-matter or in form, an urbanity
of contempt—these are the marks of the
present writers wdio are significant, those
are the ideals under which they work. Miss
Simpson has touched the fringe of this
circle if she has not fully entered it. The
best quality of her book is its limpid ease:
she is not to be bettered anywhere for
suavity of style, for the good manners of
the soul which is modernity’s golden substi-
tute for. the base metal of morality.
This rippling ease is to be found most suc-
cessfully achieved in Norman Douglas,
Huxley, Carl Van Vechten and Paul Morand,
to name the four outstanding men in the
novel who have contributed each an unmis-
takable and individual essence, a new rela-
tivity of’ form and emotion. The condition
common to all is the bracing athleticism
of mind that insolently disdains all the safe
and accepted forms, from the domestic
fidelity of Arnold Bennett to the sociological
‘generalisations of Galsworthy, which were
once considered the final word in the
aesthetic of the novel, methods never to be
discarded. But with this flowing mastery
of style Douglas has a destructive gentle-
ness which gives his work a difficult com-
bination of opposites; aloofness and vital
partisanship, scorn and happiness. Huxley
lias a delight in the wit of the emotions,
a unique grip on the complicated simplicity
of the self-conscious character, a lyric ten-
derness of love. Van Vechten gives a gay
succession of courteous laughters, the painted
masks of the emotions in a sincerely sophis-
ticated world. Morand, zig-zagging through
an apparently tortuous maze of bewildered
wit, produces perhaps the truest sense of
the furious activity of love-making entangled
with the strange sexual by-products of
civilisation that has yet been done. Though
a French writer, he belongs at least in part
to English literature, and the more we can
absorb of his method the, better for us.
As an example of how very vague is the
general conception of modernity’s effort, I
may take the sample list compiled by
“L.V.H.” (R.P. 15/10/’25). In it are
jumbled Huxley. Maurice Baring, Virginia
Woolf, J. C. Squire, the Sitwells, Stella
Benson and Dunsany; and they are accused
of being pleasing, but sterile. Huxley is the
only notable of the highest rank there, but
how anyone could say that the violent, stag-
gering, complex dance of feverish activity-
in “Antic Hay” was sterile, though pleasant,
is more than I can understand. Fecund, but
unpleasant (to the suburbs) would be a
much more obvious description. “Triple
Fugue,” by Osbert Sitwell, and “Southern
Baroque Art,” by Sacheverell, are important
books. But for the rest of “L.V.H.’s” list
nothing can be said. Virginia Woolf and
Stella Benson are merely fifth-rate shallow
modernists; Baring is nowhere at all;
Squire is a Virulent reactionary who has
mistaken a capacity for parody as one for
poetry, and lias produced a series of the
very worst verses in the language. Dun-
sany has no more connection with modernity
than Hans Andersen. To select at random,
Ronald Firbank, A. E. Coppard, Walter de
la Mare, Lytton Strachey, Laseelles Aber-
crombie and Gordon Bottomley would be
a much truer list.
Miss Simpson cannot stand by the four
masters of virtuosity I picked out as the
protagonists of the novel in 1925, despite
her good technique. The small picture of
life she affords here cannot stand by the
fulminating merriment, the profundities of
emotion mirrored in their smiling placidity
or tumbling uproar. But it is at least
possible to speak her name near them with-
out feeling the intrusion of an alien figure
into the land of their spiritual clarities.
Her book is admirable throughout in its
preservation of an atmosphere of distinction ;
she manages to produce a sensation of that
fabulous thing. Good Society, the hopeless
ideal of all servant-girls’ novelettes. One
can only produce an effect of good manners
by a subtle style, not by employing all the

DAVID JONES’
dukes in Debrett to bejcwel the page.
Michael Arlen, for instance, gives the shop-
girl's idea of aristocracy, not merely because
of the vulgar pretence at idealistic non-
chalance in his work, but because he has so
many irritating and vulgar cliches of style.
Like all bad popular authors, he does not
write, he communes with the reader. A. S.
M. Hutchinson is another example of this
over-familiar style.
If one were asked for a writer furthest
removed from the grandiose flippancy of
Mr. Arlen’s novelette style, one could not
do better than to point to “Acquittal.” The
story is, roughly, the effort of a woman who
has been charged with poisoning her husband,
but acquitted, to regain her place in society,
and the exposure (to the reader) of just
how far she was really implicated. The
one fault is due to a rather over-delicacy
in this analysis near the end of the book;
Miss Simpson is too afraid of being banal,
and ends in being merely mysterious. But
given the premises from which the story
starts, there is no fault in the logic of its
characterisation. The acquitted wife is
driven inevitably into the arms of the
“safe” lover; and it would hardly be pos-
sible to involve her more in action than
Miss Simpson does. There is, however, a
genuine charm in the. heroine; though it
cannot grow more than a comparatively
vague element, because, in art, no character
is perfectly real till we have seen it in the
grips of some central and dominating passion.
The most vital character is, therefore, Kitty,
a prattling, malicious woman who is
thoroughly alive; and the dinner-party is
a bit of first-rate writing. As an example
of Miss Simpson’s style, I quote the last
paragraph of the book :
She roused herself and went up to bed. On the
walls of the room shivered and danced the long
shadows that a candle makes. The pincushion was
a mountain in that shifting landscape, the shoulders
of a bottle loomed huge as those of a giant; her
upturned brush was a forest. She thought, half
hoping, half incredulous, that perhaps, after all, no
mountains were more real than these, and lifted
the forest away between her fingers and thumb.
It would be too conceited for a critic to
think that anything he writes in praise or
dispraise of a book is going to add to or
subtract from the book in question even a
single reader. Still. I hope I have cajoled
one person into deciding to inspect “Acquit-
tal.” Even so, that person is sure to forget
by to-morrow morning.

Theocritus and the Mime
The course of literature is often determined
by mere accident, or even misunderstanding;
and there can certainly be no quainter mis-
understanding than that which connects The-
ocritus with the invention of the pastoral, the
bucolic and the idyll. Theocritus was no
creator; the idyll is a vain fancy of modern
times; the pastoral of the Renaissance, the
bucolic of Graeco-Latin fashion are grown
out of a mistaken imitation.
Nevertheless some mistakes, by prescrip-
tion and by the impulse they have given to
production, acquire a certain respectability
and even retain our affection ; so that Andrew
Lang’s “Golden Treasury” volume of transla-
tions, with its romantically-attuned intro-
duction, is still'a pleasant thing to dip into
—though one cannot but smile at such dainty
falsification as dusk of summer eve in
a country lane when the perfume of the
flowers is mingled with the sweet breath of
the kine” ; anyone who knows the two will take
the flowers and let the cows’ breath alone. In
truth Theocritus was no sentimental pastoral
poet, and was by no means, in literature,
afflicted with the home-sickness Lang would
ascribe to him. He was a dexterous artist
in minor poetry of an ingenious kind, and,
having a quite natural desire to turn his
gift to the best profit, betook himself to
Alexandria.
The creative jieriod of the Greek genius
was over half a century dead. The poets
of this after-time could neither work on the
scale of the great men of yore nor employ
the vast wealth of metrical forms which
they had bequeathed. A few verse-schemes
(chiefly hexameter and elegiac couplet) were
chosen for practice, and, as it was canonic
that a poem should be on a small scale, the
rules were made more stringent. The matter,
theme or suggestion must come from older
literature; so that all this poetry is a deft
adaptation and transposition into a new and
highly-polished style, which again must be
so delicately modulated as to avoid mono-
tony and to suggest varieties of manner in
the older models. The French Parnassians
are a very close parallel.
Theocritus found himself when he under-
took to transpose into epic verse the mimes
of the Sicilian Sophron. These were small
scenes from everyday life, presented for their
vivid effect, and rendered in a prose which
precision of phrase and crisp brevity of
rhythm somewhat remove from daily speech.
Sophron was already a classic; Plato had
admired him. That we have lost him is one
of the many things we must deplore. But
the title-label “Mimes of Sophron” was found
at Oxyrhynclius, and perhaps the book is
in one of the boxes yet to be opened.
Theocritus is. for some tastes, at his best
when taking Sophron as a model. “The
Women at the Feast of Adonis” is like his
classic model, and in some respects strongly
reminds us of his contemporary Herondas,
whom it is in some quarters the fashion to
despise, because the literary convention which
he brought to the mime allowed a franker
realism. We see one lady calling on another,
we hear their complaints about husbands and
maidservants, the baby crying to be taken,
too; we are made to feel the throng of the
streets and the jostle at the palace-doors —-
all very everyday stuff, and very remote from
“the blue Sicilian sea.” But it is just this
kind of thing we seek and find in Aris-
tophanes with as much delight as those small
touches of natural beauty which he, too,
shares with Theocritus.
His pastoral poems are likewise mimes,
shepherd-mimes such as he found in Sophron,
and in some of them there is sufficient trace
of allusion to contemporary men of letters
to give ground for suspicion that the literary
clubs of the time were used to masquerade
as shepherd gatherings. But not merely the
mime enters into their make-up ; Theocritus
has likewise transposed into his own medium
the folk-song of the countryside, and his art
is so to modulate the recitative verse that
it can pass from the effect of spoken dialogue
to that of chanted lyric. The 'Daphms
was a famous instance, and as soon as Theo-
critus’s works were collected was set hrst
in the volume, with the other sliepherd-
mimes following, so that the “bucolic ele-
merit seemed to predominate or be distinctive.
And probably even now it does more than
that; with the “Sorceress” and the "Cyclops
(an arrant borrowing, that!) it makes up
for the general reader his concept or the
poetry of Theocritus. Therefore, it is here
attempted to give some condensed idea ot the
“Reapers,” which is a good example ot the
variety and humorous realism of the country-
mime. , ■
It is yet early morning, and the young
Bukaios 'is slacking at his work ; he cannot
keep pace with the next reaper. Milon, who
is supervising the job, asks him what is the
matter. “Oh, you, you’re tough, you can
keep at it until late. But tell me, did you
never have a desire for something afar ——
so romantic love was called in Greek high
poetic phrase. “Romantic love?” says Muon.
“What's the use of that to the man on the
land?” “And you have never lain awake at
night sick of’love?” “Indeed no! once a
pup gets a taste of the chitterlings. So,
in amusing interlude of high-flown romantic
phrase—for Bukaios is a village rhymster--
and rustic proverb it comes out that the
youngster is enamored of a Syrian flute-
girl, a slave at a neighboring farm... “How
Heaven punishes the sinner! It gives him
what he wants. A pretty sweetheart: a
regular grasshopper.” However, Milon is
not hard on the lad ; he only wants him to
get on with his w’ork, and invites him to
sing a ditty of his beloved; that will help
him. Bukaios pompously invokes the Muses,
and then addresses his Bombyka: let them
call her blackamoor, skinny, grasshopper; to
him she’s his dark-brown maid. This is
something like the tune of his song:—
The goat he seeks the clover, the wolf he seeks the
goat,
The crow hops after the ploughshare —and I upon
thee dote.
Oh had I onlv all the wealth that Croesus had of old
We both would stand in Cypris fane in statuettes
of gold ;
You with a rose and an apple, and both your dainty
flutes, ,
I strutting proudly beside you in a new pair of
high boots.
O sweet Bombyka, either foot of yours is a gazelle,
Your voice is like the tender moss—your heart, ah,
who can tell ?
But the art of Theocritus is to make this
grotesque rustic strain sound through his
beautiful filigree-music. Milon pays a mock-
compliment, and then sings the counterpart,
the Litycrses, or old reapers’ song; this, too,
naturally transposed from its lost original.
“There,” he says, “that’s the way that a
hungry chap should sing when the work is
hot. .
But as for your hungry passion, its wasting and
its scorning,
You’d better tell it to your mamma, so early in
the morning”-
as if that respectable yeoman’s widow would
enjoy the idea of her son taking up with a
gypsy.
it will be evident that the poems of Iheo-
critus, though all in one metre, are yet,
each one of them, sui generis. And that is
all that the term “eidyllia” ever meant —
small poems, each constituting a kind for
itself. As some time elapsed before any
collection or arrangement was attempted, tlm
name was the only possible one. The 'idyll,
as a form of poetry, and “idyllic” beauty are
vain things fondly imagined.
CHRIS. BRENNAN.
Triolets
Camden Morrisby (R.P. 5/11/’25) de-
livers himself into his enemy s hands when
he quotes two triolets of Austin Dobson s as
being good and typical specimens ot the breed.
Whether “worth writing” or not, certainly
they were not worth quoting in support of
his argument. It only shows how the critical
faculty can be dulled by the glamor ot a
name. Austin Dobson was a master ot tlie
French form, especially the rondeau; but i
have never seen a triolet of his, with the
exception of “The Kiss,” which would pass
muster. Triolets such as Mr. Morrisby
quotes anyone could write between the soup
and the fish. The essence of a successful
triolet is that the final couplet shall seem so
inevitable to the sense, and such a necessary
corollary to the preceding line or phrase, that
the fact of its being a repetition of the open-
ing couplet passes unnoticed; and a feeling
of completeness and “clinch” is left. Ih>
same applies to the fourth line, which should
not be a mere interpolation of the first, but
should appear necessary to the expression or
the idea. Nothing in verse can be so oanal
as a triolet with the opening couplet recur-
ring at the end as a kind of chorus, which
has no raison d'etre except the rules of the
form. It is a redundancy, and the sensitive
mind and the sensitive ear alike revolt from
but a Dance,” quoted by Mr. Mor-
risby, is a glaring instance of this fault. In
“A Greek Gift” the author has, by the use
of italics, attempted to give an impression of
variety which the sense does not convey.
Here the wheels simply creak. ‘Dallades,
and Rondels,” by Gleeson White, is the only
anthology of these exotic forms I know (there
may be others) ; but, far from thinking
the collection of triolets in it of a high
average of merit,” I consider their merit
as a whole is extraordinarily small. There
are very few whose final couplet has the
least* inevitability. The Dobson ones (six
in all, and often quoted) are to my mind
failures, except “The Kiss.” Here the italics
seem to be demanded by the sense, and the
repeated lines emerge naturally. Had this
instance been given, I should have held my
peace. Here it is :
Rose kissed me to-day,
Will she kiss me to-morrow?
Let it be as it may,
Rose kissed me to-day.
But the pleasure gives way
To a savor of sorrow;
Rose kissed me to-day.
Will she kiss me to-morrow?
Bridges has a good one aud a bad one. I
could give many specimens to illustrate both
my praise and blame. Native modesty pre-
vents me quoting some of my own which
comply with the principles enunciated. I
could also produce one which doesn’t.
Here is a pair by Thomas Hardy whicn
well show the variety of meaning which the
artist can get into the same words; even
his fourth lines are varied in meaning by
alterations of punctuation. The second trio-
let is perhaps the better, and is in fact a
masterpiece in little : —-
THE COQUETTE AND AFTER
I.
For long the cruel wish I knew
That your tree heart should ache for me,
While mine should feel no ache for you;
For, long—the cruel wish ! —I knew
How men can feel, and craved to view
My triumph—fated not to be
For long !.... The cruel wish I knew
That your free heart should ache for me!
11.
At last one pays the penalty:
The woman—women always do.
My farce, I found, was tragedy
At last! One pays the penalty
With interest when one, fancy-free,
Learns love, learns shame. ... Of sinners two
At last one pays the penalty;
The woman —women always do !
These certainly are not “the easiest thing
in poetry.” They require a high degree of
art —the art which conceals itself. But
when Mr. Morrisby illustrates his argument
(with which I agree) with such inane and
technically-defective instances as he does, he
reduces it to ah absurdity.
I will give away one of the tricks of it
which I discovered for myself. The triolet
should begin with a conditional word, such
as “that,” “when,” “for,” “how,” “in,” and
so on. These words make it much easier
for the fourth line, and the final couplet, to
be embroidered (as it were) on to the pre-
ceding phrase, and to seem to arise out of
it and to be a part of it. It is not enough
to comply with the rhyme-scheme and the
orthodox number of lines. The real artist
will seek a more subtle achievement. Where
the triolet falls short of this, it will warrant
“J.M.D.’s” condemnation (R.P. 8/10/’25),
and its destination should be that of the
unwanted puppy, the water-butt, or its ana-
logue, the waste-paper basket.

Great Security, by “Bartimeus” (Cassell). This
group of crisp, bright, well-constructed naval sketches
has all the charm and all the salt-sea tang of
similar previous work from the author’s pen. The
book has on other grounds than its literary merits
an interest to Australians, inasmuch as it is dedicated
to Commissioner H. W. Clapp, of the Vic. State

Jungle Days, by William Beebe (Putnam’s). The
nature-studies of an American scientist with an ob-
serving eye and a bright literary touch that occa-
sionally iays on the purple too heavily. Without
the suavity of the Frenchman Fabre or the delicate
sensibility" of the Englishman Hudson, he still suc-
ceeds in making the sombre jungle of Central
America fantastically alive.
Fools and Philosophers, by J. B. Priestley (John
Lane)! The author, an English essayist and
sketch-writer, describes his work as “an anthology
revealing the great comic figures of English
literature in their own words.” Its range is
wide including passages from nearly all the plays,
novels and essays familiar to lovers of books. Indeed,
the object of the compiler is not so much to
acquaint his readers with the unfamiliar as to group
together those passages and their associated per-
sonages made dear to the average reader. Falstaff,
Parson Adams, Sam Weller. Mr. Micawber, and a
host of other old friends give the substance of their
folly or philosophy, whichever it may be.
The Game, by S. W. Powell (Geoffrey
This novel of trade and adventure in the Eastein
Pacific leaves the beaten path, depending not pri-
marily on a love story, though there is one knit
into it, but upon the conflict between a young
and determined man to establish himself m the
Islands trade in opposition to an old and long
established firm which held, practically, a monopoly
of the business. Without being conspicuously
original or marked by any exceptional merit the
book holds the interest and presents a vivid pictuie.
How Our Mind* Work, by Mary Dunstan Wilson
The writer, a Sister of Charity, has prepaied this
short introduction to psychologj r with a vie w to 1 s
use bv voung R.C. teachers. As stated in a foreword
by Dr. Sheehan, Coadjutor-Archbishop of Sydnej,
the little book “puts in simple and lucid language the
true philosophy of the soul.” The larger works o
the subject are repellent to the beginner, and
only when he has mastered the elements can he pass
with ease to more elaborate treatises. 1 his handy
primer puts the principal postulates of psychology
and the Church’s attitude towards them in teims
easily grasped by the average intelligent child.
The Immortal Dickens, by George Gissing (Cecil
Palmer). Six introductions written by Gissing tor
Methuen’s “Rochester” edition of Dickens’s works.
That edition was an admirable one, enriched with
topographical pictures, but unfortunately was not
a financial success, and had to be abandoned after
only six of the novels had been issued. In addition
to the introductions is a delightful sketch by Gissing
entitled “Dickens in Memory.” Gissing did not
allow appreciation of the great novelist to blu'd
him to some obvious shortcomings. He noted the
want of plan in his subject’s novels, the lack of
ingenuity in his plotting, the often tawdry and
theatrical effects introduced. Where Dickens wrote
out of his own personal observation and experience,
he was invariably successful. “The novelist’s first
duty,” said Gissing, “is to make us see what he
has' seen himself, whether with the actual eye or
with that of the imagination, and no one ever did
this more successfully than Dickens in his best
moments.” When, however, he attempted to poitiav
the social class and type with which his contemporary
Thackeray was at home and at his ease, the effort
almost invariably resulted in a stiffly-jointed piece
of mechanism.
The Wit and Wisdom of Queen Bess, by Frederick
Chamberlin (.John Lane). He would be but a poor
court Boswell who did not pearls of wisdom
falling from sovereign lips, and it takes some such
reverential and obsequious spirit to detect the jewels
in much of the matter herein reported. The good
Queen had a neat turn of wit in propounding the
form of argument known in logic as “the dilemma,
which was prettily put in the case of one Herle.
Said her Majesty: “Herle is to be kept as straightly
and secretly as possible, and to be examined on
certain articles sent herewith, and let him looke to
be racked to all extremity if he will conceal the
truth and, contrarywise, will be pardoned with favor
if he will freely confess.” There can be little doubt
of the course taken by the unfortunate Herle. Her
Majesty had no sentimental qualms in dealing with
offenders. A poor wretch had already been tortured
by having hot “rosin” poured into his boots.
Elizabeth, having made up her mind upon the subject
of his guilt, directed the Lords Justices to pro-
ceed to his execution by ordinary trial. “But,’
said she, “if you find the effect of that course
doubtful,’ through the affection of such as shall be
of the jury, or the interpretations of the lawyers, or
the Statute of Treason, you may then take the
shorter course.” Whether this comes under the head
of wit or of wisdom is not stated. The real in-
terest of the little book is not in searching for
either of these two qualities, but in the glimpses it
gives of the temper of the time. Said Bess to Mr.
Speaker: “Liberty of speech is granted to the
Commons, but they must know what liberty they
are entitled to ; not a liberty for every one to speak
what he listeth, or what cometh in his brain to utter ;
their privilege extends no further than a liberty
of Aye or No.” The impression left on the reader’s
mind is not so much of wit or of wisdom as of a
character self-willed, imperious, somewhat unscru-
pulous, but patriotic.

6 Points for Buyers
of Forest Bonds to
carefully investigate
The fact that New Zealand hopes to redeem its
National Debt by the sale of timber from its
plantations is convincing evidence that Timber
Bonds in an approved afforestation scheme are
a safe, sound and highly lucrative investment.
Intending purchasers of Bonds should, however,
make the most exhaustive investigation and prove
for themselves that they are safeguarded on the
following six points.
1. That the Trust Fund created for their
protection is created promptly and is
held by a recognised trustee until every
bondholder in that fund has had his or
her profit.
2. That the freehold deeds of the land are
held by such Trustee.
3. That the Company issuing the Bonds
is responsible to the holders until the
timber—their property—is sold and
the proceeds distributed.
4. That the highest authorities certify to
the ability of the Company issuing the
Bonds to carry out their contract.
5. That you see the Bond contract before
you buy.
6. That the estimate of profit to be
expected has official endorsement.
Timberlands Limited
offer these and many other features that make them a highly
attractive proposition for those who desire to turn every £2O
invested now into £250 or even £5OO and over after a period
of years.
Sir Edward Iliffe, M.P., of the Empire Press Delegation, before
leaving Australia, supported his endorsement of Timberlands
Limited Bonds by purchasing fifty at a cost of one thousand
pounds. This evidence of faith in this particular afforestation
scheme gives food for thought.
Your banker, lawyer or financial adviser will endorse the Bonds
issued by this company.

A September Thought.
While the drowsy bees are humming,
And the slumbrous light falls down
On the bracken where I’m resting,
I am thinking of the people
And their going and their coming
Out of town and into town.
Comes a breeze of sweet September
Laden deep with wildwood scent,
And so soft and soothing is it,
Sleepy leaves and frondage smoothing,
That it’s little I remember
Labor lost or money spent.
With sweet blooms about me scattered,
And the green gifts of the soil,
Distant, very distant seem they,
They the townsfolk, as they hurry,
Saving time, as though time mattered,
Off to toil and home from toil.
I am thinking, while from glowing
Skies serene the light rains down,
That the people somewise, somehow,
Miss the substance, seek the shadow,
With their coming and their going
Into town and out of town.

Siesta.
These days when summer's warm, sweet
breath
Flushes the blooming cheek of spring,
And happy languor, feigning death,
Slacks down the strength of everything,
Oh, I would let all carking care
Melt in the gladness of the air!
The grasslands with their fragrance call
To soft siesta ’neath the shade
Of rustling trees, whose shadows sprawl
To tent the downward sloping glade,
Whilst otherwhere the glad sun showers
Hot light on grass and nodding flowers.
In the warm glory of such days
What matter memories of care?
Only the dreamy pleasure stays
Of thoughts that seem to float in air,
Like those white cloud-boats that on high
Serenely drift across the sky.
When mortal winter chills my blood
And to its dust my clay shall fall,
My soul may melt in such a flood
Of Heaven’s soft air and shadows tall,
Swooning at ease for endless hours
With lingering dreams of sun-kissed flowers!

In Exile.
I am heart-hungry for the rain-cooled South,
Here, where the poinciana flower flares
In the parched garden like a harlot’s mouth,
And the blue, full-blown water-lily bares
Her heart to winds that, sated with the
bloom
Of honeysuckle, and the orchid’s spray—
Pallid as though new-risen from the tomb —
Faint on the surface of the pool away.
Here bloom wild passion-flower and scarlet
pea
And flaunting ti-tree flames along the
creek *
But Memory wakes to life and cries in me
For yellow-brown boronia and meek
White upturned faces of the flannel-flowers,
For heathy pockets in the scrub that teem
With stiff-stemmed waratahs, like ruby
towers
In some fantastic kingdom in a dream I
Wistaria on my verandah trails;
And by my gate the bamboos rock and
moan
Like some seraglio mourning through its
veils,
While passionate bougainvillaea s dark tone
Blends with the ardent jacaranda-trees
Whence one bold magpie flings a serenade
And lustrous beetles cling and early bees
Bear off the loot of their last pollen-raid.
But I dream on of bracken, strung with dew,
Like diamonds on fairy gowns of green,
Of foamy frills on curling waves of blue
That creep through dawnlight o’er the pow-
dered sheen
Of shell-strewn sands. I see the slutting
dunes , ~ ,
Like amber waves strong winds unite and
part;
And every breaker, rolling inward, croons
Sea-songs that wake oil echoes m my
heart!

Give me the lights and the crowd, the eager
tramp of the feet, .
The nervous roar of the traffic down the
echoing street, ,
Faces pale through the half-light, painted
and strained and white,
And the restless eyes of the hundreds hunj-
ing through the night.
I am sick of the empty hills, the sullen brown
earth that takes
The work of the hands of a man till the vci y
soul of him breaks,
The stony peaks and the silence, terrible,
empty and still, .
The staring rocks and the parched earth that
have broken my man’s will.
God, I am sick of the silence !i Give me the
shops and the beat, .
The restless beat, of the hundreds jostling m
flic street
Give me" the sight of faces hungry and
pleasure-blind,
The lights and the roar and the laughter—
the laughter of my kind!

THE MAN WHO TOOK THE WRONG TURNING.
"The French financial crisis is very grave. The Government is on the verge of bankruptcy. It is alleged that the Government has borrowed from the Savings Banks
and the Public Trustee's reserves. The new Cabinet will be faced with a deficit of £25,000,000. The Bank of France is Cemanding a further inflation of the note issue by
£15,000,000."

THE DECLINE OF PUBLIC MANNERS.
The refinements of life have not always
followed the upward development of nations ;
and under the soft glove of mincing times
there has often been a hard hand. It is
almost impossible to say that a nation is
better or worse on account of its table-
manners or its mode of addressing a
stranger; but it is possible to say that a
democracy is stronger when its citizens show
for one another the decent consideration
which helps life to run smoothly. On the mere
ground of economy of time, a certain polite-
ness is worth while; it is still better worth
while on the ground that it saves temper,
and so conserves nerve-force. The proof
of the ability of a community to conduct its
own affairs may often be seen in the ability
of its individual citizens to conduct their
relations with one another. The lack of
courteous observances with the idea of assert-
ing an equality with other men is almost in
itself proof that equality does not exist. The
real things that can be safely taken for
granted do not require constant demonstra-
tions to uphold them ; and the unostentatious
decencies of the street in a large measure
express its security and conndence in usee.
In the sphere of the home this is even more
marked. In the splendid house of the
newly-rich there is often added to a note
of vulgar display a discomfort and uncer-
tainty as to the actions of the inmates; but
where life has run quietly under a safe roof
for half a century or more a tone of quiet
service and mutual respect pervades every-
thing and sets the stranger at his ease. The
settled home may be a cottage or a palace;
but, confident of itself, it can afford the
humility of gentleness which makes life run
smoothly. These aspects of cities and homes
may not exactly represent moral values. In
a rugged, hard-striving community there may
be qualities which outweigh the milder
virtues; but there is no reason why in out-
weighing them they should displace them.
Far out in the wildest places loneliness and
the very dearth of social advantages make
for a human consideration which is the
noblest courtesy.
* * * *
Having these things in mind, the fact that
Australian life—particularly in the cities--
is becoming ragged about the edges is no
cause for congratulation. The crowds are
better-dressed and worse-mannered; the
people have more money in their pockets and
are less kindly-tempered. The man who
once stepped aside and waited his turn is
more and more inclined to push his way
without apology. The person who takes
your fare thrusts your change at you with
a ruder gesture; the street-vendor of collar-
studs is more loutishly insistent in pressing
his wares; the grimy newsboy yells a dis-
cordant word in no known language at your
ear. Vienna swept the unwashed news-
boy from the streets 20 years before the
war; in our cities he is an increasing
nuisance, though he renders no service which
could not be given by quiet persons with
clean hands and decent voices in neat stalls
by the roadside. In the perpetual tearing-up
of streets —operations which are supposed to
specially mark our progress—certain obliga-
tions are observed in the letter and broken in
the spirit. The idea that those obligations
might have a meaning quite apart from any
fine to be inflicted if the rules are broken
never seems to enter a head. A few boards
are placed here and there; a red flag is dis-
played ; but whether the public can get
round between the motor traffic and the
boards troubles nobody except the public.
Large stones and showers of bricks are not
dropped on the passers-by as a regular prac-
tice, because it is dangerous to the person
dropping them ; but a shower of dust, plaster
or paint is quite another matter. A mere
citizen must take his chance of these things;
and the other mere citizen who throws them
down has little thought that he owes any
social duty to his fellows. The trouble is
not confined to any one section, nor to any
one sex. Drivers of motor vehicles have
completely forgotten that both by law and
tradition the street belongs to the pedestrian,
and the persons driving wheeled dangers
are only there on sufferance. The truculent
motor person now too often considers that
he has done the whole duty of man if he is
on the right side of the road, blows his horn,
and is not travelling at a speed sufficient to
win a race. What wonder if the foot-
passenger, who has missed death seven times
by the breadth of a hair, forgetting his civic
manners throws newspapers and orange-
peel about the street! Persons in authority
assist the riot by leaving open and often
evil-smelling holes in the street for weeks,
sometimes mouths. To add to the general
lapse of manners and regard for the feeling
of others, the lady takes a hand. Pushing,
banging, covered with powder that gives
forth a perfume like the decay of China,
she forces her way through the pack, look-
ing for an opportunity to increase the dis-
comfort. A descent upon an overcrowded
smoking-compartment is her favorite device.
If no one offers her a seat she will make
remarks to her friend about the male sitters;
if somebody gets up with ancient courtesy—
generally an aged man with rheumatism —
she plops into the vacant seat without a
word of thanks. She is not typical of Aus-
tralian women ; but there are quite enough
of her, and any number of apprentices.
■* * * *
To trace the causes of all this is not diffi-
cult. The years of the war are blamed for
most of it; and it must be admitted that
there was a certain license which upset old
standards. But it cannot be said that the
soldiers did it, nor can it he proved that it
is due to any one series of happenings. Per-
haps the most potent, influence of all in
lowering the standard was the imported
picture-film. Whether the Americans slander
their country grossly is not the point; the
fact remains that those pictures show a
constant stream of hustling, pushing ruffians
of both sexes. Not the slightest sign of citi-
zen regard for the community ever intrudes
into these dramas of alleged life. The loftiest
height which American humor —or the com-
plete lack of it—ever seems to reach on the
screen is the representation of a filthy person
eating in a filthy manner. Possibly the pic-
tures only represent tlie debased standard of
taste of those conducting the picture busi-
ness ; but it is not possible to feed a whole
generation on such garbage and expect an
improvement in the outward showing of
those who have been victims of the abomina-
tions. Another possible cause is the loose
political thinking that has come in with
Communism and the talk of revolution. There
are very few communists among us, and very
few of those are Australian, but the ideas
promulgated have been widely unsettling.
Respect for the conditions under which we
live, which we ourselves have made, has
been weakened. The communistic attitude—
however covered up in words —is the attitude
of the criminal. Society is regarded as the
enemy—an enemy to be hated and injured.
A faint reflection of that has run through
all the Labor movement, and finds its expres-
sion in the very things that good citizens
must deplore. Why fill up that hole a
moment before we are forced to? A, capital-
ist might walk into it and break his neck!
The fact that a person whose sole wealth
is a tramfare might also walk into, it is not
considered. And it is high time it was con-
sidered before things get worse. Australian
soldiers abroad w’ere the best-mannered troops
in the world. This staggering back to a
lower plane of courtesy, which means a lower
plane of feeling, is a foreign thing. A steady
fight against the influences —whether crude
pictures of inferior human types or ragged
gospels of despair-—is the straight course for
all Australians who value their self-respect.
DECLINE AND FALL OR
RESURRECTION?
As dejected after the event as he was cock-
sure before, Needham, a Westralian Labor
Senator of the 1906 vintage, said in Perth
the other day that his party’s defeat on
November 14 was the worst it had ever
suffered. Tried by the test of figures (which,
of course, is not the only test that should
be applied), Needham’s statement is not
quite correct, but it is near enough, as the
subjoined table shows :

The party should have captured at least two
more Senate seats in 1906, and one more
in 1914. The latter was the year in which
S. Aus. Senator McGregor died between
nomination-day and polling-day, and Labor
supporters were instructed to give one of
their .six votes to an opponent. J. W. Shan-
non. If Death had not intervened six Labor
Senators must have gone back; as it was,
five were elected, the fifth with 17,899 more
votes than the seventh man, a Liberal —
Shannon naturally headed the poll. In
.1906 the Labor vote in Queensland was split
owing to the late Anderson Dawson run-
ning against the selected candidates, and as
there was no preferential system in those
days the endorsed trio went down ; yet, though
26,771 Labor ballot-papers were wasted on
Dawson, W. G. Higgs finished within 6562
votes of the first Liberal Senator, and only
3511 behind the third.
Of Queensland it is certainly true that
the party has just experienced the most
horrible licking in its history. Even in the
disaster of 1917 it held four of the State’s
ten seats in the House of Reps., and there
was a difference of only 9428 between the
Nationalist and Labor votes for the Senate;
in fact, Laborite J. C. Stewart got within
8649 of Foll, the third Nationalist Senator.
In the present instance Death deprived it
of the Kennedy electorate, which it would
probably have held (though Senate voting
suggests that it would have been a fairly
close thing), but its F. M. Forde had a
tough fight in Capricornia, and all its
other nominees (including ex-Premier Theo-
dore) were beaten, in most cases by very
heavy majorities. For the Senate the Min-
isterial total (214,000) exceeded the Labor
total by 54.000, the greatest party majority
on record in Queensland; Givens, who is
by no means popular, got 41,000 more votes
than were distributed among the Labor three.
In other words, the State in which Labor
has been in power for ten years is so sick of
Laborism —so absolutely fed up with it —
that it will have only one Laborite in its
Federal delegation of 16. This, to uany
Laborites, is the gloomiest feature of a
gloomy situation.
* * * *
Other considerations on which members of
the party dwell with no pleasure are the
obvious difficulty of keeping electorates like
Hume (N.S.W.), Ballarat and South Syd-
ney ; the certainty of a redistribution of
seats, which will strengthen the Nationalists
in places like Barton (N.S.W.) and weaken
Labor in constituencies like Kalgoorlie; the
8500 majority polled by the non-Labor
Senators in Angas (S.A.), which suggests
that if the man who beat Gabb looks after
the electorate he will hold it till his teeth
drop out; and the now unavoidable struggle
for supremacy between the good Australian
and bad imported elements in the party.
This struggle could have only one re-
sult if battle were joined on that particu-
lar line; but the good Australians are cum-
bered with “moderates” whose cold feet will
feel for the easiest way out, and the bad
importations will have the assistance of
Tammanyiscd Australians with axes to grind
or grudges to feed. The result, nevertheless,
will determine whether the Labor party is
to be born again or consigned to the tomb. It
has had two terrific warnings, one in 1917
and the other in 1925; and it is not likely to
get a third.
THE MEETING OF AUSTRALIA’S
CREDITORS.
It is a reasonable assumption that, one of
these days, Australia’s creditors will either
be called together or will meet without
being called, to consider the situation in
the ordinary way of business. Nobody
imagines that they will meet in person, for
no paddock is large enough ; but legal repre-
sentatives will assemble. The event will
not necessarily mean that default has come,
but it will mean that a mighty large mass
of expert advice is required to prevent it
coming, and that there is need to appoint
financial advisers and supervisors in the
creditors’ interests, and in Australia’s. Such
events have happened before. In the case
of Egypt the outside financial control was
so complete that it amounted, for over 30
years, to entire management of the country.
Turkey and China have had collectors and
auditors put in. A similar guardianship of
Mexico was beginning to work when the
erratic Napoleon 111. broke up the concert
of three advising and collecting Powers by
rushing into a scheme of conquest. “Man-
dates,” which include financial guardianship,
are now as common as earthworms, and
Australia itself holds one or two. If some-
body gets some sort of mandate over Aus-
tralia it will only be part of the tidy order
of things. In some cases the interference
doesn’t require to go much further than
control of the Customs, but in Australia it
would have to include management of the
railways as well, it being impossible to sort
out the tangle otherwise.
The more respectable section of Australia
seems to tacitly accept the financial situa-
tion as past hope, and to have arrived at
a mutual agreement to say nothing about it.
Or it would be more correct to say that that
part of respectable Australia which takes the
trouble to know that there is a situation
accepts it in that way. It is easier to
await events than to shape events. The
position is that the outside interest bill,
which calls for real money and not local
paper, can’t be paid except out of the pro-
ceeds of further loans. Or it can’t be paid
otherwise save by an effort which would
cause the almost certain downfall of any
Ministry, and its supersession by a combina-
tion which didn’t demand efforts. So the
cry for more outside loan money has to
grow more intense every year, and it is
impossible to keep on doubling the stakes
indefinitely. There is no other financial situ-
ation just like it in the world, and there
is no other peace debt in the world which
is just like ours in proportion to population.
An effort was recently made to check the
outflow of British money and to coerce Aus-
tralia into paying something out of its own
resources, just as an effort was made to
stop the payment of Government subsidies
to the 42-hour-per-week British coal indus-
try, and make it stand on its own feet. In
the latter case it was decided to go on pay-
ing a while longer in order to avert a catas-
trophe for which the Ministry was unpre-
pared, but it made no disguise of the fact
that the surrender was only temporary, and
that it meant to become prepared. In the
former case it permitted the resumption of
lending; and as it did so after intense press-
ure from the combined Agents-General, that
might also be to avert a catastrophe for which
it wasn’t prepared. But long continuance of
a situation in which J. Bull has to lend
himself his own interest or go without must
lead to a pressing request for a look at the
books, and a pressing offer of assistance to
straighten the accounts. In other words,
it will be proposed that Australia should
climb down a little from its proud attitude
of complete self-government.
There are possible complications in the
case. Australia possesses an apparently
large, and certainly influential, revolutionary
class. The revolutionists advocate, and
declare themselves confident of establishing,
a Soviet cataclysm of the Russian variety.
That would mean the repudiation of outside
public debts as well as inside ones; the con-
fiscation of externally-owned property and
capital equally with that which is internally-
owned ; and a rotten time for people born
here and born anywhere else. The leaders
and organisers of the movement work and
conspire on the theory that a people not
quite as numerous as the population of
London or New York, anil mostly living
within short gunshot of the sea, can defy the
world’s civilisation as completely as a mostly
inland and very inaccessible crowd of 23
times their number. They further assume
(and perhaps with some justification) that
a fairly educated community which has been
accustomed to self-government (even if it
has made a mess of self-government) tan be
dragooned into barbarism as completely as
an ignorant race accustomed to be governed.
They take it for granted, being of small
comprehension, that their worst orgies won’t
provoke outside interference; that the pro-
vince of an empire can perform in the same
fashion as a tvhole empire; and that J.
Bltll has an absolute fondness for losing
money—a thousand million pounds or so. J.
Bull has lost a lot of money, but now he
shows signs of having lost his patience as
well, and has developed a collecting spirit.
He is even collecting a 23-years-overdue hill
from Honduras. Whether the gyrations of
imported objectionables and native dupes will
hurry on the Meeting of Australia’s Credi-
tors and increase its demands for control
of our affairs depends on the amount of
latitude allowed them.
A notable possibility of the future is the
transfer of Government railways to trustees
for the benefit of the aggregate public
creditor, with construction rights and land
grants. Of course, there would be restric-
tions accompanying the transfer. To guard
against a recurrence of the necessity for
borrowing abroad to pay interest abroad, the
raising of State foreign loans would cer-
tainly have to be prohibited, and the rais-
ing of Federal ones, save for war purposes,
either prohibited or put under close limita-
tions. The old borrowing system shows every
sign of being worn out, and any attempt to
start a new one of the same pattern would
be unthinkable. It is impossible to fore-
cast how long the period of financial super-
vision and reconstruction would last. Every-
thing would depend on how long it took to
put the lunatic’s estate on a solvent basis,
paying off (not writing off) losses and depre-
ciation, selling utterly defunct “assets” or
abandoning them if no selling value exists,
and clearing up generally.

The Injustice of the Justice.
The office of Justice of the Peace has been
described by 11. G. Wells as a “knighthood
of the underlings.” There was a period in
British history when these conservators of
the peace were chosen by the freeholders in
the County Court; subsequently their
appointment became nominally the gift of
the Crown, though in reality a distribution
of petty honors by the political party in
power. In the days when the selection of
Justices was confined almost wholly to “the
gentry” and educated middle-class, it was
as much a custom for the young men of
the county and other class-marked families
to become students in the Inns of Court as
it was for them to qualify for graduation in
the universities of Oxford and Cambridge
There was some appreciation then of the
fact that the duties of the Justice called for
at least an elementary knowledge of law
In modern days that need has been wholly
lost sight of. The appointment has become
purely political. When it is proposed to
elevate Casey or Smith to the Bench of the


Court of Petty Sessions, a policeman is called
upon to report on his qualifications, in many
instances boiled down to the bare facts that
there are no convictions against him and
that he can sign his own name. As an
English writer has expressed it, a member
of Parliament will secure, the gift “for his
useful henchman much in the way that
the dead fox is given to the hounds after the
day’s run.” Recently in Victoria, where the
J.P. sits on the Metropolitan Bench with
the Police Magistrate, and frequently by
virtue of numbers over-rules him, it was
suggested that some of the more glaring
cases of miscarriage of justice might be met
by requiring the Dogberries to state the
reasons on which they came to a judgment.
But the State’s Attorney-General does not
think that in the case of majority decisions
any good purpose would be served by pub-
lishing the names of the Justices on either
side, and the grounds on which they arrived
at their decision. It would, he fears, leave
them open to criticism ; and he urges that,
whilst Justices are expected to defer to the
presiding Police Magistrate on points of law,
they are unfettered in registering their con-
victions on points of fact. Herein the Attor-
ney-General shows that he does not realise
the depth of the gulf that lies between the
paid and the unpaid magistrate. The former
is, broadly speaking, taken out of the active
life of the community, and has received a
legal training in the law and its procedure,
including the rules of evidence, which are
to legal proceedings precisely what the rules
of fair play are in any clean sport.. He lifts
the facts into a dry light, and examines them
there, as far as may be humanly possible,
free from bias and prejudice. That is just
what the average untrained J.P. does not
do. The truth is stained in liis mind with
likes and dislikes, personal prejudices, and
it may be personal enmities. Hence the
people would like to have his reasons. They
may trust the Judge and the trained Magis-
trate who are more or less out of the hustle
of life, and who work on basic principles
bedded in our judicial system; but they
don’t trust the man in the street, the knighted
underling. Victoria in this matter is far
behind the times. It is now a good tale of
years since N. S. Wales put an end to the
J.P. system, .so far as the metropolitan and
other principal districts in the State are con-
cerned. It still exists in the country, where it
would be practically impossible, without the
expenditure of a very large sum of money,
to limit the administration of justice to the
paid magistracy. But the evil in the country,
though it does son etimes crop up, is not, nor
ever has been, as great as it once was in
the city. The bucolic mind is much more
amenable to advice from the P.M., or, in Ins
absence, the C.P.S., than the mind of the
urbanite is. What Victoria should do, and
ought to have done years ago, is to follow
the good example and place the whole judi-
cial power in the hands of a stipendiary
bench in its metropolitan area and in the
principal country centres. That it is not
practicable to do it everywhere, is no excuse
for neglecting to do it where it is not only
practicable but most urgently called for.

Medical Knowledge in Australia.
“ G.F.S.D. ”: The recent article (B.
38/11/’25), entitled “Australia, Reparations
and Disease,” on the need for more medical
research in Australia is opportune. Lately
we had the opportunity of conducting Mr.
Embree, head of the Rockefeller Foundation
in New York, over the Melbourne Hospital,
the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Re-
search, and the medical departments of the
University of Melbourne. While agreeing
that the Hall Institute is doing excellent
work, under its able director, Dr. C. H.
Iveleaway, in the application ot the basal
sciences to the diagnosis and treatment oi
disease, Mr. Embree was emphatic on the
need for further research on the basal
sciences, especially physiology and Pathology,
which should, he said, be carried out in the
University medical departments. When
shown over these departments, he was
amazed at the poverty of endowment and
apparatus. It was pointed out that in the
pathological department there were three
whole-time permanent officers, all of whom
have produced and published original work
during the last three or four years, and had
been awarded an international research
prize, the David Syme prize for Australian
scientific research and the Armytage Medical
Research prize—the latter twice. Yet,
owing to the financial stringency at the Uni-
versity, it has lately been found impossible
to provide these men with the necessary
fittings and apparatus to enable them to
carry on further work. Surely a bright
state of affairs for a rich country like Aus-
tralia ' Again, the same department posses-
ses a medical museum of the utmost value
for the teaching of students. This was built
up by Professor Allen, a wonderful achieve-
ment, and as fine a collection as that of any
London hospital medical school. Yet the
great majority of these specimens have
never been mounted so as to be available tor
studv bv students and practitioners, lhey
have lain in their bottles for 20 or 30 years
almost untouched. Why? Because the
department cannot afford to pay an officer
whose business it would be to turn this
magnificent collection to use. These deficien-
cies which could be met by a compai atively
small outlay, mean *a loss of knowledge tor
the medical profession for which the people
must inevitably suffer. It is, of course, true
that certain sums have from time to time
been made available by private benefaction
to the University; but unfortunately most
of this money has been earmarked for. special
purposes, such as cancer or tuberculosis work.
This is unfortunate for two reasons. In
the first place, direct attack on medical
problems has seldom produced the results
aimed at. The world’s best discoveries have
almost all been made by men working on
other lines, but enfilading, as it were, some
other sphere. So that each man of research
is best left to work along his own line and
see where it leads him. His discoveries,
when made, are then readily and quickly
applied to practical uses. This leads up to
mv second reason. In the various medical de-
partments are men expert in certain lines ot
work, as a result of years of study and work
along their own lines. These men cannot sud-
denly switch off and become experts on cancer
or tuberculosis because endowments have been
made for those purposes. If they did, their
expert work would cease and go for nought.
The result, therefore, is that these men are
starved for apparatus to carry on their own
equally important work, yet cannot touch
money with which the department has been
endowed because it is earmarked. If ear-
marking is to be, let it be for nothing less
general than “medical research,” so that
whatever work is already in hand can be
pushed forward more quickly and with a
larger output of results. This especially
applies to work on the basal sciences which
is being, or should be, carried out by the
Universities.

A Call to the Simpler Life.
Dear Bulletin, —Does the socialist ever
ponder what he is after? Of course lie will
tell you his immediate aim is to equalise the
distribution of wealth. He does not want
capital to be tied up in knots; he wants the
knots loosened and the cash to flow in s
generous stream his way and the way of all
good comrades. Thus he thinks he will attain
happiness. But wealth never did nor ever
will secure man’s happiness. Once above
the poverty line additional income may mean
many things—display, luxury, cigars and
champagne, dress and amusements; but not
happiness. In broad terms an income which
is sufficient to secure wholesome food, allow
adequate physical exercise, and provide for rea-
sonable mental, social and aesthetic needs gets
all there is worth having out of life. The sur-
plus, if there be any, may provide pleasures,
but it won’t add to the sum total of happi-
ness. There probably never was a more un-
happy age than the present. It is evidenced
on every side; the tranquil home life, the
serene outlook, the stable nerve seem to be
disappearing. Men and women riot m
pleasure, using it as a dope against the
underlying unhappiness of life. The priest
recommends religion, and the physician pre-
scribes draughts, massage or electric baths,
but the proletarian and his enemy the bour-
geois agree in at least this one respect that
they both believe the cure-all to be money.
“If?’ says a writer, “we classified the whole
nation into definite categories of physical
health on a scientific quantitative basis, it is
easily conceivable that an actual falling oft
in health might be shown among certain
classes after a fairly high point on the
ascending scale of incomes had been reached.
What, then, are the advantages of large
incomes to the majority of those who
possess them? Highly seasoned foods, late
hours, continuous excitements, hustle and
worry all along the line. And the payment
nature demands: deteriorated health, neu-
rosis and all the rest of the ills that wait on
wealth and the struggle to get it. It would
be a wise nation that calculated its wealth
in terms of health and not of money, and a
wise people that sought happiness instead of
pleasure. But the ideas of wealth and cost
and value are so confused that we are apt to
think anything that has a higher price in
money has a higher value in itself. In
point of fact,” says a health authority,
“many expensive foods, such as oysters,
asparagus, caviare, etc., are physiologically
inferior to those costing less; some of them
possess hardly any nutritive value at all.
Yet it is to get these things and other false
values that the socialist and his mother and
his aunt flutter the red flag. A very modest
income will secure simple nutritious food, a
hygienic home, healthful rest and reason-
able —that is, sane —recreation. Much more
will give plentiful excitement, a vast display
and the pleasing jealousy of your fellow
men, a deplorable liver and the nerve of a
fluttering schoolgirl. “The overfed man or
means,” says another ultra-honest medical
practitioner, “takes rides in fast motor-cars,
and thus secures a high cooling power to
relieve him of the heat generated by las
meat and drink. Thus uselessly and most
uneconomically is the energy of food and
petrol wasted on the self-indulgent. there
are few men who can stand up against tin:
heavyweight champion Wealth. During the
war nearly two and a half millions of men
of military age in Britain underwent medical
examination. They were graded, and all along
the line fitness decreased as income increased
beyond the fair living margin. In the lnghly-
paid professions it is made clear that per-
sonal wealth does not secure an even pass-
able standard of health, yet health is the
foundation of happiness. Wealth cannot buy
it, but it may destroy it very effectually.
What, then, do the socialists and commu-
nists propose to do when they dip their hands
into the treasure chest? Are they at all
likely to live on lentils and hymn the simple
life? What can they get out of wealth that
others can’t? —Yours. Chops.
Coal Strikes.
“C.0.M.” interviews a frank coal-magnate:—
He told me, to begin with, that the one thing in
connection with N.S.W. coal-mining disturbances to
be remembered was that a perfectly good under-
standing exists between the heads of the two parties.
I suggested that in that case the strikes were a mere
trick played on the public. “Do the miners in the
Federation know that?”
“■Not on your life! The bosses do —the bosses on
both sides. When a mine closes it generally suits
it to close. ‘Pull the men out,' is the word; and
out they go. The game’s easy. The men are
generally ready for a holiday and grievances are
always on tap.”
‘‘But why should a mine want to shut down?
“For many reasons. Here’s an example. Say 1
run the Blaclcsoap colliery. I take a contract to
supply coal to South America. The price is fairly
good, but freights are high. The deliveries are to
spread over ten months. In the contract there is
a clause suspending deliveries during strikes. I
gamble on freights falling; instead of falling they
rise. Two months’ supplies have gone forward ; the
third month finds me up against a losing proposition.
Now it’s time to speak to the storekeeper, who is
the chief strike agent. The men come out; the
newspapers make a song; the strike leaders curse
the bosses; and a cable goes to South America sus-
pending the contract under the strike clause. But
there is no real fight; the moment freights aie
down I whistle the men back into the mine. That’s
a typical small strike; and some of the big ones
have been very much on the same patten).”
“But the miners’ officials —are they all rascals?”
“Not exactly rascals. They think it is all in the
game. High wages for the men and good conditions
are what they are after, and in a sort of way they
get them. Certainly there are bribes. Biliasmmps
would pull his crowd out for £IOO and put them
back for another £SO the next week. But there
are very few like that. The game is pretty crooked,
but they play it asj straightly as they can.”
“But these men know what they are doing?”
“Certainly they know; but what have they to
kick about? The miners are the best paid in the
world. It is the public that foots the bill. There's
a sort of honor in robbery about the whole business.
The worst frauds are those in connection with big
public and semi-public contracts. Officials take a
regular royalty to let low-grade coals displace the
stuff tendered for. Some contractors pay three or four
such royalties to hold their contracts. One small
hotelkeeper in Sydney acted as a go-between for
years, and those accepting and paying bribes never
even saw each other.”
“What’s the remedy for it all?”
“Nationalisation of the industry, when the nation-
alisation can be freed from political control. But,
unless we change a lot, that will only come with the
Millennium.”
*
The Raw Material of Progress.
The most uncompromising Protectionist
would not advocate high duties on articles
which can never be made in Australia or
anywhere else, especially if the effect
of the duties would be the shutting
out of things which possess educational
or artistic importance; and no sane
person would suggest that a duty which
yields no revenue worth mentioning and pro-
tects nothing can be worth retaining. Yet
such a duty is charged on the large class ot
art objects grouped as antiques; and that is
why C. F. Laseron, on behalf of the Col-
lectors and Connoisseurs’ Society, has made
a direct appeal to Minister for Customs
Pratten to put the crooked matter straight.
Laseron, whose distinction as a geologist is
perhaps overshadowed by his knowledge ot
Oriental porcelain, is an enthusiast m a
cause which is much bigger than it looks.
Nearly all the great modern art industries
have been founded upon a study of the art
impulses of different countries in different
ages. The so-called antiques are, in fact,
the raw material of human knowledge m
directions which count for very much m the
elevation of public taste; and that Australia
should be debarred from the possession ot
them is both unwise and absurd. At present
no special provision is made for the admis-
sion of antiques; high duty on the declared
value must be paid for articles brought m,
whether under the heading of pottery, manu-
factured brass, glassware or some, other
regular trade line. An article with an
original value of, say, 12s. 6d. has, because
of its rarity, been sold for £IOO in London.
It is worth £IOO by the standard fixed by-
art sales; but to land it in a private collec-
tion in Australia will cost £l5O or more on
the present plan of assessing the duty. Ihe
U.S.A. admits free any article certified as
being more than a century old; and although
this does not quite cover the ground, as many
articles of less than that age are already in
the class of valuable antiques, it affords
sufficient relief.. The alternative proposal
is that the duties should be levied on the
basis of the approximate value of the articles
as new, not upon the value caused by their
rarity. This would probably meet the whole
difficulty in the easiest way. If a decorative
vase worth a thousand pounds is held to
enter into competition with one locally made
for £1 —in the sense that it might occupy
the same space on a mantelshelf —-that mat-
ter is surely reasonably adjusted by a duty
of something under £l, not by a prohibitive
charge of four or five hundred. As matters
stand there are a good many branches ot
ancient applied art of which there are not
nearly enough examples in the Common-
wealth to make any study possible. And
every day the difficulty is increasing; for
while Australians are denying themselves the
right to possess such things, wiser nations
are buying them and placing them where
they will never again come into the market.
+
Immigrants from the Mediterranean.
Australia is copiously mentioned in a Mal-
tese Government report on emigration from
Malta and Gozo in 1924-25. Since the
TJ.S.A. enacted its “terrible quota law, the
Commonwealth, it seems, has been regarded
by the Maltese “migrant” as the Promised
Land, its attractions being reckoned superior
to even those of the Barbury States. “To
the villager who is fit the spell of Australia
is irresistible; and thus we see a consider-
able flow of men, followed by their women
and children, in numbers intrinsically small
but great in relation to the size of their
country and big in heart, moving on the long
trail from one part of the Umpire to an-
other, conscious that they are going among
kinsmen and under the same flag: a relief
to the first, which has no room for them, and
an asset to the other, whose boundless spaces
are crying for men.” So wrote Henry
C a solan i. of the Maltese Government K mi-
gration Office, in 1923. But the fair pros-
pect of those days, is now clouded, and the
enthusiast has grown melancholy, without
losing any portion of his eloquence. Aus-
tralians, he says, do not welcome the Mal-
tese as kinsmen and fellow-subjects. The
attitude of the Commonwealth Government,
he allows, is correct, and the Federal Labor-
leader also has testified that “the Maltese
who have come to this country have proved
to be good unionists”; but “the extreme
Labor elements” have no use for Mr. Caso-
lani’s countrymen, and “low propagandists
malignantly slander them. It is currently
alleged, he reports, that the Maltese is a
foreigner with a dash of the tarbrush hi
his composition, whereas he is really a
Britisher of pure white European stock,
with many essential qualities in common
with the Irish.” He finds that it is asserted,
too. that emigration, to Australia is a means
whereby thte Valetta Government gets nd
of undesirables. His answer is that the
“migrants” are mostly industrious peasants,
with a fair proportion of public-school boys
and skilled workers, who are required to
produce evidence of good character, to pass
medical and literacy tests, and to have at
least £lO on landing; further, their num-
bers are limited by agreement with the Bri-
tish and Australian Governments, and have
only amounted to 15,68 in three years. Mr.
Casolani claims that there is no instance
on record of a Maltese having been prose-
cuted for begging or stealing in Australia or
becoming a charge on the taxpayers. In an
impassioned strain he declares that “there
are hundreds of Maltese in Australia who
have fought shoulder to shoulder with the
Australians on Gallipoli and other fields,”
and that “these ‘foreigners’ are the same
Maltese who made of their own firesides a
home for every battle-scarred Australian and
Maorilander who came to their shores during
the great struggle.” On the whole, allowing
for patriotic exaggeration, he makes out a
pretty good case for his countrymen, and
Australia is certainly in no danger of being
swamped by the surplus population of two
little Mediterranean islands with fewer in-
habitants altogether than Tasmania. But
the Maltese are not mentioned in the most
interesting paragraph of his report, which
reads as follows :
The campaign against the influx of immigrants into
Australia was originally directed against the Italians,
the Greeks, tile Egyptians, the Syrians and other
alien nationalities from the Mediterranean littoral,
shiploads of whom began to arrive, especially in
Queensland, as soon as the quota law had shut them
out of the U.S.A. The Italians, who are admittedly
the wisest emigration organisers in the world, forth-
with instituted an intensive counter-propaganda
in which at least two Italian archbishops and numer-
ous priests were engaged. Distinguished Italian ex-
naval officers with a liquid knowledge of English
arrived, and, accidentally, but very opportunely, a
celebrated Italian airman was at once on the spot.
A well-known and brilliant Fascist, the Deputy for
Emilia, is conducting a clever counter-campaign,
while a host of immigration commissioners, agents
and very capable and enthusiastic consuls are every-
where demonstrating about the thrift, the industry,
the technical ability, the superior quality, the adapt-
ability and the immense value of the Italian immi-
grant to Australia. Finally, an Italo-Australian
Association has been formed in Sydney (N.S.W.),
the object of which is to assist Italians settled in
Australia in their spiritual, moral, intellectual and
economic needs, to help them to acquire a thorough
knowledge of the laws, customs and language of the
country, and to publish a newspaper which will
be the' official organ of the union and will be printed
partly in English and partly in Italian.
A statement this of uncommon significance
to this country. The coming of Pinedo was
certainly a master-stroke of policy. What-
ever may be thought of some of Fascismo’s
performances, it lacks neither brains nor
energy.
The Education of Young Australia.
“Dr. Nil” : I see no reason why grown
people who like to gloat over unpleasantness
should not have the opportunity of doing so.
For them certain films may not be “inde-
cent” ; the pig-trough is decent for the hog.
But I confess that it astonishes me that
even uncouth and ignorant parents
will take their children to see things
at picture shows that they would not
mention before them in their homes. What
ordinary father and mother would take their
child of, say, six years to See a shocking
railway accident with mangled and bleeding
people writhing in agony ? Would the aver-
age parent take a little girl to see a 20-round
prize-fight with four-ounce gloves? Is it
conceivable that any of these people would
allow their children to go out at night and
watch loving couples at their amorous doings?
I fancy they would consider it a gross insult
even to ask them such a question; but most
unreasonably, for, as a fact, the children
who arc allowed to go to such pictures
see these things in much more detail than if
they looked on at the real occurrence. I have
recntly seen a magnificently “produced” film
of one of Victor Hugo’s novels. In it the
following incidents are represented with the
most astonishing realism: (a) A young girl
being “put to the question,” her legs screwed
up in a vyce. till she “confessed” ; in the back-
ground a man crucified, and attendants mak-
ing pincers red-hot. (b) A crowd besieg-
ing a cathedral while a nightmare of a dwarf
poured molten lead on them from above,
(c) The same young girl having a protracted
struggle with the villain in a locked cell,
the picture fading out at the last possible
moment, and showing the caution: “\\ hat
is the use of struggling? You are mine
now!” And this is not the only aspect of the
subject. The effect upon flappers of both
sexes produced by soaking their minds in
indecency, ranging from mere bad manners
to salacity and crime, appears in such inci-
dents as that which happened recently at a
ball in a Government House, when a young
woman shot her lover, holding the pistol close
to his body in the approved American
fashion, her sister afterwards attending a
picture-show while the “heroine” was in the
dock waiting for the verdict.' Significantly
the jury said “Not guilty.” It is indeed
time that the stream of American films
coming into Australia was either disinfected
or dammed.
Welding the Races in South Africa.
Dear Bulletin, —The disturbing influence
in S’African politics to-day is Tielman
Iloos, who occupies the same position as
General Hertzog did in the Botiia Min-
istry when Botha was trying to weld the
two white races into one. Ambitious, clever
and patriotic to the verge of fanaticism, he
represents the extremists of the secession
movement, who begin to realise that General
Hertzog cannot give them what they desire.
The Dutch of S’Africa have love of country
in their bones. I doubt if even the Der-
vishes are more willing to sacrifice their all
for the land of their birth ; and I doubt if
there is a more patriotic family than the
Booses —they come from that Tielman
Boos who reached S’Africa three centuries
ago, at once became a thorn in the side
of the Dutch East India Company, and
helped to fill pages of history-books. I
wanted to get some idea of the cause of
the modern Tielman’s antipathy to the Eng-
lish (not individually, but collectively, as
half liis best friends arc English), but I
could not get anything definite from him.
But I think I know. The misrule of Eng-
lish statesmen has had something to do with
it, the invasion of the early eighteenth
century, the non-fulfilment of indemnity for
the release of the slaves, the siding of the
British Government with the Kaffirs when the
colonists were fighting a cruel and relentless
enemy, and the giving back of territory winch
the burghers reckoned to be rightly theirs.
And then there is—or was —the insularity
of the English, the air each one has pos-
sessed of owning the earth, and the reserve
which has been so difficult to break down.
The Dutch are really a kindly, sociable

“Weatherspoon” : Dr. Truby King, who
has made Maoriland’s infantile death rate
the lowest in the world, recently upset
authorities in Melbourne and Sidney by
outspoken criticism of the position in
Australia, where 15 per thousand more
infants die than in the Fortunate
Islands of the Pacific. 11l Melbourne,
whose death-rate is the highest among Aus-
tralian capital cities, the care of infants lias
been cursed by personal animosities of long
standing between self-appointed leaders. If
it were not serious it would savor of comic
opera to have had two factions each endeavor-
ing to secure tile approval of the M.L.
authority for their system. Chief Secretary
Dr. ArgYLE has done the right thing in
crying “A plague on both your houses! He
has commissioned Dr. Vera Scantlebury
nnd Dr. Henrietta Main to study and
on the systenl by which Truby King
obtained mch mna rkable results, and
after reviewing the Victorian methods,
to make a recommendation to the Government.
in N. S. Wales the position i's fveu more re-
markable, as the care and control of infants
is left to politicians and laymen. The regu-
Jar medical authorities of the Health De-
partment have been pushed out, and the
condition is chaotic. 111 spite of thousands
people, always ready to shake hands and
offer a tobacco-pouch to any stranger: and
every race that came along responded to
their hospitality save the English. But in
spite of the Tielman Rooses the welding of
the races goes on, on the lines laid down by
(leriera I Louis Botha, the greatest and
kindest Dutchman of them all. The in-
sularity of the English is disappearing, and
the two races meet in social life ana
public work, and all the prejudice and
misunderstanding is becoming a thing of the
past. The boys go to the same school and
play together in the football fields and at
cricket, and the girls are equally sporting.
And these are the future builders of a race
that will be neither Dutch nor English, but
South African. —Yours, Robert Brothers.

The matter of passports calls for considera-
tion by the Federal Government. Instituted
during the war, these things still remain
seven years afterwards to harass travellers.
The chief reason advanced for their reten-
tion is that they enable the Commonwealth
to prevent people owing income-tax from
leaving the country with their dues unsettled,
and to keep tab on the movements of indi-
viduals. The first purpose could be served
by making it necessary for prospective tra-
vellers to present their tax receipts before
booking passages by overseas vessels, and
there is nothing but a fine sound about the
other excuse. Actually it is the old story
again—set up a Government department and
it is almost impossible to break it up once
it has struck its roots into the soil cf
bureaucracy.
“Northerner" : The fusion of Queensland
anti-Labor parties ends an old political feud.
The quarrel started in a clash between city
and country interests in 1902. and even when
the Country party and the “United” party
coalesced six months ago the former still
insisted on the exclusion of four mem-
bers—W. H. Barnes, G. P. Barnes, C.
Taylor and W. Kelso —who were regarded
as representatives of the Roma-street market
interest. The party had not forgotten the
time when farmers complained bitterly of
the low prices returned for their products,
and the Courier took to publishing the
number of every truck arriving at Roma-
street, with the price obtained for the con-
tents. In a letter signed by nearly all
Roma-street, the Commissioner of Railways
w T as asked to prevent the newspapers from
getting this information. The Commis-
sioner replied that he could not do
anything, and would not if lie could. One
of the signatories was Taylor, M.L.A. —and
the farmers have never forgotten it. W. 11.
Barnes, almost alone among the men of
Roma-street, refused to sign the petition,
yet he also was put on the black list. Now,
however, for the sake of party unity, the
farmers have sent out a message: “Come
back; all is forgiven.” So the Barnes-Taylor
group has been absorbed into the united
Opposition, and the old feud is over,
“Nakhoda” : With the concentration of
people in a few cities the desire to get back
to Nature, if only for the week-ends, in-
creases amongst the toiling millions. In
Sydney the shrewd citizen looks towards
Upper North Shore to satisfy this primal
urge. Asked why he passes Bay-road. Woll-
stonecraft and Cluitswood, and selects a site
for his desirable det. res. at Dindfield, Gordon
or Ivillara, he will say that it is not so
much because the land is cheaper as because
trees are so much more plentiful in the
last-named spots. The first thing he does,
unless the previous owner or the agent has
already obliged him, is to destroy the trees
and shrubs on his own allotment. For a
month or perhaps a year, while he prepares
his garden plots and lawns, he gains aesthetic
happiness and health from contemplation of
the bush remaining on the unoccupied blocks
around him. In course of time more Nature-
lovers come, and the bushscape slowly
changes to a sharp-toothed horizon of tiled
roofs and stuccoed chimneys. The noble
blackbutt at the corner and the odd groves
of pittosporum and wild wattle growing on
the edges of the roadway continue to shed
their peaceful influence on him as he plods
to work, but only because he sturdily con-
siders it is not his business to remove them.
Comes a time when it is brought home to
the collective consciousness of all the house-
holders that their thoroughfare has reached
the dignity of a street, and that the local
council is not doing its duty by them. Suc-
cumbing to the united pressure of the rate-
payers that conscientious body sets to work,
and at great expenditure of the residents’
own money recalcitrant Nature’s resistance
is finally broken, and the road begins to
assume the semblance of a city street. Then
the new seekers after nice building blocks
amongst the lovely gums pass Lindfield,
Gordon and Ivillara by, and go further north,
while the Nature-lovers in those crowded
suburbs begin to wonder how it is they have
got trapped in bricks and mortar.
THE PERSISTENT MONO.
"Labor leaders arc proclaiming that the movement must be purged of Communism.”
THE RANK AND FILE: "Elio, loot’s the bin idea?”
THE LABOR BOSS: "Goin' to drown the dory, o' course."
THE RANK AND FILE: “Wot! Again?”

back, is it?”
being spent on baby health-centres, there
has been little reduction in mortality during
the past 10 years, whereas in the previous
10, while the medical Health officers had
control, the reduction had been so marked
as even to have attracted inquiry from the
M.L. Health Department. Now Trudy
King finds that for years N.S.W. mothers
have been supplied with information as to
the feeding of infants which are acknow-
ledged to have been misleading. Surely here
is an opportunity for the Commonwealth
Health Department to invite the help of the
M.L. Health Department and ask it to lend
Truby King to -Australia for a sufficient
time to organise the system which has proved
so successful in the Dominion. No feeling of
medical or State jealousy should be allowed
to interfere with tackling this problem on
broad national lines. Here is a crusade
which should have the backing of every Aus-
tralian, rich or poor. Nationalist or Labor.
At the very moment when the N. 8. Wales
Government promises to chop out the Observ-
atory. Sir Frank Heath, secretary to the
British Department of Industrial Research,
emphasises the tremendous service scientific
men are rendering, and backs Prime Minister
Bruce’s statement that only by making use
of such service can the present high standard
of living be maintained. Though the star-
gazing part of the business may have a far-
away look to the popular eye. it must be
remembered that pure science is always re-
quired to find the path for applied science :
and it is impossible to tell which branch of
investigation is going to give world-changing
results. If it had been proved that the
Observatory was ill-managed, stood for stag-
nation in scientific thought, or was so hope-
lessly out of date that it was past reform,
there might be an excuse for its removal;
but none of these things are even suggested.
More than this, if scientific work under
Government authority is to be torn up,
broken and tossed about in such a fashion,
no sincere scientist will attempt it. The
Government scientific positions will then be
filled with men who will loaf on their jobs
and therefore rust in their knowledge, their
real energies going out in intrigues among
politicians to prevent the loss of their
salaries. Lanc; may be proud of his grip on
the axe, but. he wields it in a curiously
clumsy manner.
“Feng-Shui” : Sumatra (Dutch Fast
Indies), once populated entirely by hairy
dwarfs and other rumors, is now the home of
a robust pergerakan merah (Red movement).
From the vernacular newspapers I learn that
the Atchenese, an independent mountain folk
who successfully resisted the Dutch in one
of the longest wars in history, but have lately
settled down, are liberal subscribers to the
Cause. The argument used by the Com-
munist agents to get the unsophisticated
native to disgorge is that, when the Soviet
army arrives, the wives of non-subscribers
will be nationalised. This notion is hereby
offered to Mr. Garden for inclusion in his
platform. It sounds more appealing than
the nationalisation of things like mines and
railways.

“Ex-Dig.” : An account of the attempts to
bomb London and other ports has been pub-
lished in “German Air-raids Over England,
1914-18,” for which a Captain Morris, who
apparently has access to German military
papers, is responsible. The chief conclusion
one draws from the contents is that air-
raiding was a failure ; and most of us who
were in London at the time had already
decided that the largest result from the
enemy point of view was the effect on the
people’s morale. Otherwise little real damage
was done. The Diggers’ more personal experi-
ence ran on the same lines. The Germans
made innumerable attempts on the rail-
way bridge at Boulogne; there were nasty
holes all round, but they did not get the
bridge. When the Australian Ist Division
was rushed up from Amiens to the broken
sector near Meteren in 1918 the trains
had to be pulled up for a couple of hours,
with fires drawn, while a buzzing fleet of
’planes tried to knock Hades out of it. The
total damage was three slight casualties,
although the experience was mighty un-
pleasant. In London I watched the course
of a ’plane which, it appears, had nasty in-
tentions on London Bridge. The first bomb
damaged a tram on the Embankment, killing
a few people, and incidentally splintering
the lions near Cleopatra’s monument; the
second landed in the Thames; the third woke
up Southwark. The bombs were disturbing,
but did not get anywhere near their objec-
tives.
♦
‘•X2X” : There are two conditions precedent
to the successful production of power-alcohol
from molasses and sugar-waste in this
country, viz., the provision of a suitable and
cheap denaturant and the revision of the
Commonwealth excise laws and regulations.
The chief properties sought in a good denatu-
rant for duty-free spirit are such nauseous-
ness to the taste and smell as will prevent
the spirit from being used for drinking, and
a cheapness that will not influence the price
of the spirit. In pre-war days methyl alco-
hol, or wood-spirit, was employed as a
denaturant, but when it rose in price and
became unobtainable in sufficient quantities
it was succeeded by pyridine, a foul-smelling
substance obtained from old bones and simi-
lar material. Benzine and naphtha have
also been tried. But if alcohol is to be pro-
duced by the hundred million gallons in Aus-
tralia, it will probably be found that the
cheapest and most available denaturing sub-
stance will be the original one, methyl alco-
hol, which could be manufactured here much
more simply than pyridine. The other ques-
tion, that concerned with the excise regula-
tions, may provide obstacles harder to sur-
mount. Most of our laws have been framed
to discourage local production of power-
spirit, and to bring into being as few distil-
leries as possible, seeing that only the large-
scale sort can be easily watched. Obviously
such laws will have to be amended if there
are to be small factories capable of dealing
with limited quantities of raw material in
districts whence it would not pay to send it
to a larger establishment.
♦
“W.I-1.E.” : During the hearing of a recent
case at the Darlingliurst (Sydney) Sessions
it was sworn that tubercular pigs were
passed by inspectors for a consideration.
That may or may not be true, but even if
true it would affect only a very small per-
centage of consumers compared with the
distribution of milk from diseased cows.
There are few dairy herds that can success-
fully pass a bacteriological _ test. I have
often seen obviously “lumpy” cows_ in the
bails and their milk poured into the separa-
tor. The cocky justifies his _ disgusting
offence on the plea that he can’t afford to
throw the cream away nor destroy the
diseased beast unless compensation is paid.
There is some provision by which the owner
of a diseased animal ordered to be destroyed
may obtain compensation, but so many
miles of red-tape is required that Cocky re-
mains silent and continues distributing his
germ-infected milk and cream. Let anyone
with even a superficial knowledge of tuber-
cular and cancer symptoms in cattle ex-
amine some of the dairy herds, and there
will be found convincing evidence that more
stringent precautions are absolutely neces-
sary to safeguard the health of the com-
munity. In country dairying districts the
local policeman includes “stock inspector
among his other jobs, and it’s an absolute
impossibility for him to examine every beast
in his area —even if he had the requisite
knowledge. Consequently he takes Cocky’s
word for it that there are no diseased cattle
on the farm. The Health Department issues
instructions that cleanliness must be rigidly
observed, but did anyone ever hear of an
inspector making an official call at “milking
time”? Many a milker sits down to his job
his hands thick with dirt, the cow's udder
still covered with filth, and very often teats
badly sunburnt. Yet Officialdom is satisfied
that everything in the garden is lovely, and
replies to police-court evidence that “it lias
every confidence in its officers.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The British seamen went back to work
at the beginning of the week —those who had
any work to go to —and the “Australian
Seamen’s Union thudded once more. Though
called “Australian,” at least 70 p.c. of the
union and quite 90 p.c. of the officials are
immigrants, many with little English. These
facts may well be borne in mind by the
National Government, especially if any more
monkey tricks are attempted within the next
few weeks. In that case, the Government
will have to consider whether the coasting-
trade monopoly should be entrusted any
longer to a mob of importations, who have
shown that they have no love for Australia,
and who take a malevolent delight in doing
it harm in all sorts of ways.
Declaring that “the Seamen's Union has
acted against the best interests of Labor,”
the Fremantle branch of the A.L.P. has given
it notice to quit the local Trades Hall. It
is a welcome but belated declaration. For
many disastrous months the Seamen’s Union
has “acted against the best interests of”
Australia, but political Labor offered no
objection, even when the outlaw union organ-
ised and financed the crime known to the
rank and file as “the pommy strike,” now
ingloriously ended. Political Labor only
takes action when it discovers, to its horror,
that the electors hold it responsible for the
immense injuries inflicted on Australia by
the Seamen’s Union.
The N.S.W. Lang Government, which Inis
got the wind up since November 14, has pro-
hibited the sale of communist literature on
the Sydney Domain. The proceeding is cited
as an example of the Labor party’s stern
courage. “Stern” is the word —the courage
of the man that has been kicked into it.
Whatever the upshot of the Walsli-Johan-
sou proceedings, this stands out clear: the
men who were responsible for starting the
seamen’s strike and carrying it on are quite
unfit to lead men. The result proves that.
The strike was utterly hopeless from the
start; and only a certainty of winning could
have justified .the seamen who were here in
breaking away from their union in Britain.
If Australian unionism had a really repre-
sentative body that could speak for it, it
would hold an inquiry, fix the responsibility,
and ascertain whether it was an honest
strike undertaken with the hope of winning
or whether the poor beggars were tricked into
striking by revolutionists and men with pri-
vate grudges.
“In view of the appointment next year of
a new High Commissioner for the Com-
monwealth,” W. M. Hughes tells a Sydney
newspaper that “Australia must be repre-
sented in Britain by the best brains avail-
able.” The gentleman is too modest to men-
tion where the best brains arc housed, but
if the Government doesn’t take the hint it
vrill show itself possessed of a mind like
a toad in a cesspool. Also it can go to
bhthering blazes.
Being m trouble last mouth, Australia
naturally sought help from Diggers. Of the
70 Ministerialists elected for the Senate and
the House of Reps., 28 saw war service. And
while certain well-boomed non-combatants
crashed, greatly to their own surprise, the
four returned soldiers among the Laborites
f 'Mftf i Ee f got back; one Cole-
man, M.11.R. for Reid (N.S.W.), doubled
Ins majority in a State where Ins party fared
badly. These facts suggest that the people’s
verdict was fundamentally a protest against
Labor poltroonery on the issues raised by the
Communist strikes, with discrimination in
favor of individual Laborites of proved cour-
age—an indignant repudiation of the pro-
position that the nation which gave birth
to tlie A.I.F. should cravenly submit to being
bossed by aliens who want peace with the 1111-
whipped enemy in time of Avar, and war
with fellow-citizens in time of peace.
Tliere have been two by-elections in South
Aus. since the State Labor party beat the
Barwellians, and the latter have won both,
On Saturday the East Torrens seat, which
Harry Kneebone resigned to have a shot at
Boothby in the Federal Labor interest, Avas
lost to W. A. Hamilton, a former Lib.
member of the Assembly, avlio secured the
significant majority of 3998, polling 9421 to
Laboritc McArthur’s 5423. The Gunn Goa -
eminent is thanking its stars that it won’t
have to go to the country till 1927.
In the M.L. elections last month an aniaz-
ing thing happened—there were voting ties
in two electorates 111 Lyttelton Labor and
Reform polled 4900 each • in Westland T. Y.
Seddon a Nationalist, son of “King” Richard,
scored ’4176 and so did the sitting Labor
member. In each case the returning-officer’s
casting vote Avent, against the holder of tlie
seat, and that meant an uproar, many
BAULKED!
authorities, including ex-Speaker Lang, hold-
ing that the casting vote should be given on
the Parliamentary principle of leaving mat-
ters as they were. But both the law and
May are silent on the matter. In any case,
the Parliamentary principle appealed to is
that, if possible, the question should be left
open, and you can’t leave a question open
by settling it for three years, when it would
have to be settled again, anyway.
The Queensland Labor Convention, to be
held in February, promises to be lively.
Theodore and his followers blame the com-
munists for the Federal defeats, and announce
that they are going along to the convention
to drive them out of the party. The indus-
trial section, which is friendly to commu-
nists and foreign extremists generally, threat-
ens to do some driving out on its own account.
The Brisbane Trades and Labor Council
(which lets a room to the Communist party)
proposes to anticipate the convention by call-
ing a special conference for a general over-
haul of Labor’s political machinery. If all
the sections throw out all they say they want
to get rid of, there won’t be much left.
Dr. Argyle, Vic. Chief Secretary, will
handle the Seats Commission Bill in the
Assembly, and is hoping for better luck than
he had with the redistribution measure 18
months ago. All he will ask Parliament to do
this time is to authorise the appointment of a
commission of three to re-shuffle Assembly
seats on the basis of 24 for the metro-
polis (instead of the present 21) and 41 for
the country (in place of 44). The quota for
the metropolitan area will be approximately
23,000 electors, and for the country slightly
less than half of that; in other words, 40
rural voters will have the same power as 100
in the city. The idea is to get the com-
mission mapping during recess, so that the
scheme will be ready for next session. It
will then be open to the Assembly to accept,
refer back or reject what the triumvirate
offers. Premier Allan found it easier to per-
suade his Cocky section to accept the com-
promise than Treasurer Peacock did the
wayward Libs.
In tlte Aboriginalities pages there has
been a discussion as to whether some people
haven’t got the power of foretelling earth-
quakes. There seems to be no doubt about
it. The best example The Bulletin knows
is ex-Premier Gillies, of Queensland, lie
not only smelt one coming, but got the State
to make an earthquake-proof dug-out and
give him £2OOO a year for caretaking it for
seven years.
Defeated Labor candidates and others are
busy telling Priminister Bruce that his bill
requiring a secret ballot before a strike will
do no good. Bruce, observing what the
secret ballot has just done for him and his
party, may have his own opinions on that
subject. ‘ No doubt the secret ballot can
be made a dud. Dor instance, the. recent
ballot might not be of much value if after
it was taken the Labor party was permitted
to post pickets at Parliament House to
threaten Nationalists with broken heads, etc.,
if they went inside. And the ballot might
not have been itself much good if Labor par-
tisans had conducted it. Bruce will have
to see that the ballot is a straight, fair test •
and then picketing will have to be declared
illegal.
The Lang Covernment's Widows’ Pension
Bill lias dodged one absurdity-—as drafted it
offers benefits not to all widows but only
to widows with at least one dependent child
under the age of 14 years. That makes not
widowhood but the care of the child the
basis of the pension; and so the chief objec-
tion to the bill disappears.
The Queensland Labor candidates for the
Senate polled a trifle over 2000 more than the
Nationalists'in Kennedy. This indicates that
that electorate would have sent Charles McDon-
ald back to the House of Reps, had he lived.
However, Senate and House of Reps, returns
differed markedly in many parts of Australia,
and it is possible that Francis's personal
campaign would have been as effective in
Kennedy as was F. M. F'orde’s in Capri-
cornia, wlicre the energetic young man was
1629 ahead when the Labor Senate ticket
was 1090 behind. If Francis decides to re-
sign, the sportsmanship of the proceeding
and the moral effect of the Labor rout will
very likely result in his re-election. But
he has certainly a case for hanging on.
Whoever was responsible showed poor judg-
ment in selecting an ex-Laborite to run
against “Texas” Green in the Kalgoorlie elec-
torate, which now contains many farmers.
A resident cocky would have done a lot
better. With a Country-party man among
them, the Ministerial Senators beat the
Labor three in Kalgoorlie by a couple of
hundred votes; but the agriculturists who
supported Carroll viewed the House of Heps,
affair as a struggle between one Laboritc.
who at least had some interest in their in-
dustry—“ Texas” thoughtfully bought a farm
before the election —and another, tin; latter
a stranger from Perth. So “Texas” won
by a majority of 3769. But the victor’s joy. is
sobered by the knowledge that Kalgoorlie
is destined to absorb portions of the neigh-
boring rural electorate of Swan, and it so
happens that the subdivisions nearest Kalgoor-
lie are hopeless from the Labor point of view.
When 7000 or 8000 cockies from these sub-
divisions are included in Kalgoorlie, “Texas”
will need to buy about 14 farms if lie is to
move the vote of thanks to the returning-
oflicer.
Victoria has decided that Country-party
Premier Allan is about the most uninspir-
ing individual who ever milked a cow. But
there is no definite talk about getting new
methods along with a new Premier. Vic-
toria has wandered into the habit of spending
about eight millions of loan money per
annum, largely on what it calls “settlement,”
though it is already the most settled of the
States and could best afford to let the busi-
ness take care of itself. The estimated result
since census day is 119,000 more people in
Melbourne and 6000 more in the rest of the
State, and the last year showed a decrease
in the cultivated area. In fact, the “settle-
ment” business, though it has created some
130,000.000 of new debt, lias been a potter-
ing and purposeless affair of the suburban
property-agency description. The Cabbage
Garden had better give up the make-believe
and devote itself, pending new develop-
ments, to paying off some liabilities. As
the least-taxed place in the Commonwealth
it could do something of the sort without in-
juring its health.
Either Peacock has too many irons in the
fire —what with the Treasury, Education and
Labor —or he does not take the pains to
prepare that he did in other days. His
speech on the Teachers’ Bill (which pro-
vides additional opportunities for promotion
and preserves a proportion in grades) was
disappointing. It lacked the lucidity and
magnetism of his performances when he car-
ried through factory legislation and educa-
tional reforms. The force and earnestness
he employed in 1896 in a House of compara-
tive notables were factors in securing the
majority to pass wages boards legislation.
Certainly the Assembly of ’96 was worth one’s
best effort, and just as truly the present
House isn’t; but if the “father” of the Cham-
ber (a youngster of 64) won’t maintain the
best Parliamentary traditions, who will?
According to Governor Bridges, of South
A us., just back from a flying trip to England,
Priminister Baldwin takes the scarce popu-
lation of Australia very much to heart. “If
T were Prime Minister there,” he said to
Bridges, “I do not think I could sleep quietly
in my bed until I had a population of 29
millions on that continent.” But it is just
as easy for anybody in Australia to say that
if he were Prime Minister in Britain he
wouldn’t sleep comfortably while there were
even a quarter of two million people unem-
ployed. As a matter of fact, it would be far
easier to set a million men quickly at work
in Britain than in Australia. A factory
doesn't take as long to build as the average
farm takes to become productive.
Now that the Federal elections are over,
the Melbourne dailies have renewed their
favorite game of Cabinet disruption. To
former years one of the sheets could be de-
pended upon to maintain a decent reticence
if it could not ascertain accurately what
was going to be done politically. Its readers
would swear by any prediction it made.
Nowadays it fires shots as recklessly as the
others, and misses more frequently than it
hits the mark. One reason why Parliamen-
tarians won’t be sorry to quit Vic.’s capital
is that, once beyond the Murray, they will
avoid the irritation of this stunting. By
the time the Melbourne papers reach ’Berra
the stings won’t hurt nearly as much, if at
all.

AN AUSTRALIAN POLICY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The tumult and the shouting dies;
The party cries grow thin and meek,
Save where some soul that missed a prize
Raises a long and solemn squeak.
One fact remains that none may shirk:
’Tis time Australia got to work.
The all-wool communists are few,
And those few feeling very sour;
The best or worst that they can do
Leaves them a thousand leagues from power.
But dangers all about us lurk—•
Salvation only lies in work.
The wrecks of broken nations lie
In plenty round the groaning North ;
With frenzy little peoples try
To shift their load and show their worth.
But Fascist, Bolshevik and Turk
AVill never do Australia’s work.
Our continent lies fair and wide
With promise for the willing years,
And room for all our strength and pride
And solace for our silent fears.
Beyond the shadow and the murk
Horizons may be reached by work.
Why should we stand with empty hands,
A treasure buried at our feet ?
The wealth denied to other lands
Is here by sun and shower made sweet.
North-east from Perth, north-west from Bourke
The virgin waste is wide for work 1
Get down to plain tin-tacks and see
How great a policy is this.
The morning light is wide and free,
The open track we need not miss ;
We dare not fail, we must not shirk
The call to honor, wealth and work!

oince 1920 total income has doubled in
both departments. It has been a story of
progress from record to record. Circum-
stances have, of course, generally favored this
and other insurance cos, in piling up their
figures. A policy for £lOO is not worth more
than one for £67 10s. was 11 years ago ; and
in view of the general rise in values it is as
easy for most people to pay a premium of £lO
to-day as it was for them to pay one of £6 12s.
6d. in 1914. The average policy issued is, there-
fore, much larger than it was; in this office
in the Ordinary department the average
last year was £223, as against £lO6 in 1913,
the year before the war. The rapid increase
of insurance figures is for this reason not all
that it looks on the surface; and because
of the great shrinkage in the purchasing-value
of money Australia has not really increased
its insurance benefits to anything like the
extent the figures might suggest.
Still, allowing for all that, the progress
made by the T. and G. has been extraordi-
narily good, especially when the expense rate
is taken into account: —

Those decreases are a tribute to the standing
the T. and G. has won in the eyes of
insurers. Ordinary business was done in
the last 12 months at a lower rate than in
any of the preceding six years, and at a figure
reached by few other offices. On the basis
that renewals cost 7 p.c., the balance of
expenses being chargeable against new busi-
ness, the T. and G. last year won the latter
at a cost of 78 p.c., the same as in 1924 —
a quite creditable performance. Some of
the new offices are scrambling for business
at more than twice that figure. The new
low-level in the Industrial section is even more
creditable than the Ordinary’s record. Total
new business last year was a fraction less
than that written in 1924. but total income
was £271,058 greater. The quality of the
business completed is good, as the renewals
bear witness. The society’s actuary made
the usual valuation and found a surplus of
£194,418 in the Ordinary and £86,411 in the
Industrial. Of the former £186,898 and of
the latter £83,230 is to be distributed as
bonuses. This will give most Ordinary poli-
cies 4s. per £lOO assured more than in the
previous year; their bonuses will range from
365. to 745., according to period in force.
In the Industrial section the bonuses will
amount to 10 weeks’ premiums on policies
from 5 to 10 years in force, 20 weeks’ from
10 to 20 years, and 30 weeks’ for those over
20 years. Here again the great changes which
have taken place in the value of money are
manifest. Bonuses nowadays seem almost
prodigious; but it has to be remembered
that interest earnings are 25 p.c. more than
they used to be; also a bonus of £lO in 1911
was worth as much as a bonus of £l7 is
to-day. The fact that the insurer must get
into his head is that if he was reasonably
well insured with policies amounting to £lOOO
in 1911 lie can only get the same protection
for his dependants by increasing his policies
to £l7OO to-day.

But though the rates advanced very definitely
last year they were still far below’ the per-
centages on which the premiums were com-
puted. Incidentally, the " Temperance”
section (32.2 p.c. of expectation) was again
“distinctly superior” to the experience in
the general section (54.2 p.c. of expecta-
tion). The average is, however, very good,
and means large probable future profits
available for bonuses.
The society splashes a few adjectives over
the 9* millions of new assurances written,
but even better was the increase in invest-
ment earnings:—

The increase in the premises item w T as due
chiefly to the erection of the society’s sky-
scraper in Adelaide. Premises are in the
books at “a conservative value”; £828,000
certainly looks moderate, considering the
extent of the letting premises connected with
the various T. and G. offices. The decrease
in loans and the further expansion in public
securities are worthy of note.

Electrolytic copper averaged £67 65., com-
pared with £67 16s. 7d. for the preceding 12
months. Court aw’ards again lifted wages—
equivalent to nearly £1 per ton of copper
produced, according to general-manager Mur-
ray. To compensate, treatment methods
were improved, leading to higher recoveries
and lower costs. So far as the former is
concerned, the over-all copper recovery was
92.76 p.c. (90.74 in 1924), so there is not
much to get now in that direction. But
Lyell is not solely dependent on the red
metal. Certainly the copper side of the busi-
ness still bulks largest in the balance-sheet,
but prices will have to recover before it
dominates profits. Here are the co.’s other
interests
Chemical works (Yarraville and Fremantle) £485,240
Shares in other cos. . . .. .. 168,905
Hydro-electric plant . . ~ .. 88,078
The shares held are chiefly in Metal Manu-
factures, Ltd., of Port Ivembla (N.S.W.I,
which is doing very well.
All income is amalgamated in one entry,
so it is impossible to trace the returns from
the co.’s various activities. Some time ago
the directors gloomily said that with copper
at £63 work would be unprofitable. But
lots of changes on both sides of the book
have taken place since then. All that can bo
said now is that the co. is doing very respect-
ably indeed, with conditions wretchedly bad
so far as copper is concerned, and that if
any radical change takes place it is likely to
be for the better. Net profit claimed by the
accounts was £174,605. This Column, how-
ever, lias included amounts allowed for depre-
ciation (£31,314) and prospecting and
development (£11.274), and then shown
them as written off; also it lias included the
net amount by which reserves increased dur-
ing the year. Obviously the profit figures
arc not exact; even the insider can only
make a guess at them. The liquid position
is, however, a different matter; and here
the improvement is significant:—

Surplus £654,672 £737,123 £805,015 £950,361
That, is an improvement of £145,346; and
meantime £128,919 has been paid away in
divs. So it looks as though the co.'s
revenue for the year lias been £274,265
greater than its outgoings, including a large
sum of money spent on plant. It doesn’t
follow, of course, that that is the true profit;
something, no doubt, has to be struck off
that against depreciation. But even so the
figures are very striking. The directors are
confessedly piling up funds with a view to
further extensions of the chemical works.
They spent much over £50.060 on them last
year. And yet, as shown above, liquid assets
improved by £145,346 after paying the divs.
Distinctly, things are not so bad.
Although production figures were smaller
than they were in 1924, the blister output
from current ore supplies was actually
greater than for some years; 1924 produc-
tion was swollen by the smelting of an
accumulation of concentrates :

Slightly more ore was mined, but metal
contents were a shade less. Incidentally, ore
reserves of North Lyell were re-calculated,
and the figures are greater than they were
at September 30, 1924: —
Tons Copper Silver Gold

Mount Lyell (including
South Lyell).. .. 1,624,998 0.5 1.5 0.04
As development work has been limited since
the bottom fell out of the copper market it
is more than likely that the North figures
will be added to later on.
Just how mining costs were cut back is
visible in this comparison:—
1923. 1924. 1925.

Smelting charges ... 82,065 89,980 76,971
Freight and copper charges 59,534 77,449 74,493
There was no industrial trouble during the
year. Work was concentrated in the North
mine, operations in Lyell being restricted to
production of pyrites required for flux. The
work of raising the Lyell Blocks shaft
through to the surface should be completed
during the current yehr. All plants operated
satisfactorily. A considerable portion of the
copper was disposed of to Metal Manufac-
tures. and Australian requirements will
shortly absorb practically all copper pro-
duced —something worth a cheer. Plans are
in hand for still further reduction of costs,
and altogether shareholders have good
grounds for their better opinion of tin' scrip.

At the half-yearly meeting the Bank’s Deed
of Settlement came in for revision. Oppor-
tunity was taken to make many alterations,
including one to permit of the establish-
ment of branch registers, and to insert a
provision which will permit of amalgamation
should such ever be deemed advisable. That
has given a fillip to rumors of amalgamation
—the market doesn’t seem happy these days
unless it is busy marrying off some bank to
another. As far as this Column knows, the
Westralian has no thought of disturbing its
celibacy; but there is no knowing what the
future holds. Some day the restrictions im-
posed by the Bank’s limitation to one State
—and that the most sparsely populated and
with its greatest industry dying—may force
matters. In its present condition it certainly
will find itself handicapped for many years
by the difficulty of getting fixed deposits.
These at present are actually much less than
the bank’s own reserves, and only just over
half as much as the capital and reserves
combined. Though very little profit was laid
by last half-year the results indicate that
the earning of the 174 p.c. div. should be
easy enough, for this reason: a large pro-
portion of the money raised from the new
shares was available for only a part of the
term, while the full div. was paid for the
full term. ' As capital was issued at a pre-
mium ou the Board’s tip that 16 3 p.c. p.a.
could be earned, the market has 110 com-
plaints. Gold production in the West is
diminishing fast, fruit and timber are hold-
ing their markets, pearls and shell are still
in need of improvement, and wool and wheat
prospects are good. The decline of the gold-
mining industry is serious; but the bank has
had ample warning, and it should not be
left with many overvalued securities.
Gross profits for the half-year amounted
to £126,833, compared with £110.852 for
the preceding six months and £98,509 for the
September, 1924, half. Expenses, including
taxation, were: Last half-year, £60,926;
March. 1925, £64,585 ; and September, 1924,
£57,631. Expenses per cent, were lower
than for a considerable time. The balance
of premiums received from the 200,000 new
shares (£280,225 net) lifted reserves to
£1,269.240, so that (including the undistri-
buted balance) total funds on September 30
amounted to £2,008,420. Liabilities aggre-
gated £2,955,537 —less than . March figures
and less than those of a year ago. That
meant that the bank was holding less than
30s. of the public’s money on current account
and otherwise for every £ of its own. In
the case of the W. A. Bank exceptional
strength is necessary; other banks, with
their business well distributed over the Com-
monwealth and beyond, think it safe to hold
£8 of the public’s money for £1 of their own,
although most of them work well within
that figure. Here are complete balance-sheet
figures:—

The proportion of liabilities represented by
liquid assets —over 38 p.c.—is the best for
a long time. The 174 p.c. div. rate is,
of course, entirely misleading; to the great
majority of shareholders it represents 7
p.c. or less, and the earlier 20 p.c. divs.
represented but little more.

That profit for the past year differs from
the figure claimed by the accounts. There
was a net reduction of £2803 in reserves, so
that amount has been struck off earnings.
Trade was well maintained, according to the
directors, but the continuous improvement
in manufacturing methods throws plant out
of date very rapidly, and that, of course,
means heavy writing-down out of gross earn-
ings. This factor contributed to the heavy
reduction in net profits last year. The
future, however, is bright, and will be
brighter if the Minister for Customs gives
the co.’s new fibre box some desired protec-
tion. Balance-sheet figures have moved as

The war gave the co. its opportunity when
it forced on substitutes for tinplate con-
tainers. The initiative disclosed then has
been supported by management which has
held and widened the business. And the
progress continues. Additions to factory
premises were made last year, and further
machinery was installed, plant, etc., increas-

The miners worked a bit more regularly
—hence the profit. But the deficit had to be
attended to, so prefs. were passed over again.
The 6ft. seam disclosed by the drill three
years ago is being worked, and soon the full
height should be reached. As the quality js
excellent, the development may result in
prefs. getting their accumulation and some-
thing being passed out to ordinaries. The
latter possibility is, however, by no means
rosy, unless the management has better suc-
cess in finding markets (ords. have had a
lone 5 p.c. in 15 years). North Bulli coal
is of splendid coking quality, but the col-
lapse of the copper market has made that
virtue a poor asset for the time being.
Furthermore, future earnings must be con-
sidered with an eye. on the chief asset.
Consider this comparison :

Debentures .. £32,000 '

Whether there has been sufficient allowance
for depreciation and waste is a matter which
must govern future earnings. Certainly the
new seam in the main west headings is a
good development, but, again, everything
hangs on the marketing. Over the period
shown in the table the debenture debt has
been wiped out and liabilities have increased
by only £3OOO, but capital is £9103 more,
and is now £214,912. Here is another

Wiluna float (W.A.) has been under-
written and only a limited number of shares
will be offered in Australia. Meanwhile
much is being said about the solidity of the
proposition in London and the West. If
the show proves to be only half as good as
represented, the public may reckon itself
lucky to have got in at all at par. That
chance doesn’t often happen in the case of a
mine with really large prospects. In the
early days of the Rand the valuable deep-
level areas which were known to carry pay-
able gold before operations were commenced
were never offered to the public. Their
owners were quite content to furnish the
sums required for their development, and it
was only at a premium of from £2 to £lO
a share that the public was afterwards
offered an interest. When the Coolgardie
boom burst and the public was hard bit, a
new co., the Sons of Gwalia, was floated. It
bad a large capital and a large sum was
set aside for working and equipment. But
it was all subscribed privately and the shares
only appeared in the market at £2 each. The
reason for this was that a large quantity of
payable ore was in sight and the prospects
of the mine were very favorable.
* * * *
South Kalgurli’s latest estimate of ore re-
serves exceeds by 28,000 tons actual and
15,000 tons probable that of six months ago,
and the grade is, if anything, a little better.
The tonnage now in sight places the mine
about three years ahead of the mill, and
sufficient profit should be earned to main-
tain the present div. of 25 p.c. p.a. during
that period.
* * * *
The full report to Tarcoola Blocks on
the Springvale lead-mine at Ajana (W.A.)
is by James Hebbard, late of Sulphide Corp.,
who ought* to know a decent show from
a duffer. The Northampton lead deposits
were worked 60 years ago, and now are get-
ting a spin because of the high price of
metals. Hebbard’s conclusions are favorable,
as far as things go. The workings are
shallow. Some ore is rich, some poor, and
shoots are irregular. But _ at 100 ft. down
an ore channel 18ft. wide exists. There 80ft.
of driving has been done, and Hebbard estx-
mates that the ore removed has gone from
16 to 18 p.c. lead. Actually from 12 to 14
units have been recovered, and as concentra-
tion methods are crude 16 to 18 p.c. seems
to be a very safe estimate. Hebbard wants
the old-time plan of working the rich shoots
jettisoned and a shaft sunk to 400 ft. to test
the run of ore properly. As that will mean
a cost of £lO,OOO Adelaide baulks at the
jump. Still, it is the wisest plan. Probably
some alternative may be suggested,_ but if
Hebbard sticks to it that the show is valu-
able the Tarcoola Blocks crowd may fork up
the money.

Late surface prospecting at Radium Hill
by the Radium and Rare Earths Treatment
Co. has brought to light several new forma-
tions carrying carnotite, titanium and vana-
dium, so that it looks as if the area held is
likely to prove rich beyond earlier anticipa-
tions. The point is to gauge their extent,
and manager 11. Grenfell will tackle that
job as soon as the mill is at work. Final
treatment is to go on at Dry Creek on the
radio-active concentrates. There are buyers
for the concentrates, but the co. naturally
wants to get all the profit there is in the
business rather than let the concentrates
drift into the hands of foreigners specialising
in the production of rare elements from the
gangue.

Many moons have gone since Wallaroo and
Moonta closed down to let in the machinery
man and pay off debts. In the first year the
liquidators got in £141,608, and last year
£63,928, or £205,536 in all; and with £1136
of cash in hand they have had £206,672 to
deal with. Debts paid in full to secured
creditors and 12s. 6d. in the £ to others have
mopped up £111,703. As ordinary expenses
have taken £51,950, roughly £43,000 of cash
is still in hand. Accounts to collect and
sales amount to £22,891, and with that fur-
ther sum in sight cash items will swell to
£65,884 against remaining debts of £60,643.
Thus a surplus of £5241 shows. But the
British taxmaster is after the co. for £25,000
income-tax during war-time, and his demand,
although rejected by the liquidators, has to
be faced. Lancelot Stirling hopes the Brit-
isher won’t get a penny, but once in the law-
courts anything may happen, even to a dere-
lict.

Monty Cohen at the Amalgamated Zinc
annual meeting gave shareholders little in-
formation as to intentions and prospects.
The outstanding feature is that shareholders
are to have the co.’s holding of 300,000
Electrolytic Zinc shares cut up among them
on a 3 to 5 shareholding basis. Electro-
lytic scrip stands in the market at 325., this
cut-up means a refund of nearly the whole
of the capital of the Amalgamated Zinc.
It comes as a nice bonus to top off the co.’s
record of £1,200,000 of divs. during its
affluent career. Out of 3,500,000 tons of
purchased mine material, it got products
worth £5,000,000, which, if people on the
Barrier mines had had a little more faith
and a good deal more enterprise, would have
gone to their shareholders rather than to
those who got the Amalgamated Zinc afloat.
However, there might not have been any
Electrolytic Zinc in that event, so the tally
may be about square. Cohen’s reason for
the distribution is that his crowd thinks
that, if it goes on with the paper-making
proposition, it should only be in association
with suitable partners. Which suggests that
othersiders with funds and experience want
to join up. Anyway, a nice bagful of assets
remains in the safe for the board to play
with —or release, should it go into liquidation.
* * * *
!The anxious questions being asked in
N.S.W. Parliament about the alleged im-
pending water famine at Broken Hill are
giving amusement to Barrier people. If the
supply for the town is meant, there is enough
in store for at least six months; while if
an “emergency supply” for the mines is re-
ferred to all the railway trucks in South
Aus. couldn’t carry enough to keep them go-
ing. The truth is that unless something
altogether unexpected happens the water in
store will keep the mines going full swing
for three months more, and if there is not
a decent shower of rain before then the
fates will be more vindictive than they ever
have been before in the history of the field.

The expedition to Hall’s Peak (N.S.W.)
to locate and map the ore body (silver-lead)
by wireless consisted of Major Farrow,
Werner and Quodling (wireless operators),
David Milne (late chief inspector of mines,
N.S.W.), C. Tayler, J. B. Rickard (members
of syndicate) and Pearson (Inspector of
Mines). The modus operandi is thus de-
scribed :—•
The transmitter and receiver are placed in posi-
tions about 100 yards apart. After getting into
touch, the helix of the transmitter is depressed
gradually from the horizontal to the perpendicular.
If no sound is caught at the receiver during that
movement, the “shot” is wasted —there is no ore
body between the two positions. If, however, when
the helix is depressed at, say, 55 degrees, the
sound of the transmitter is heard at the receiver,
ore has been located. As the directional beam is
reflected from the ore at an angle equal to the angle
of incidence, and the measurement of the base line
is known, the : depth of the ore may easily be
calculated.
J. B. Rickard in his report states that after
several shots had been fruitless, weak signals
showed “earthy ore’” (gossan) at a depth
of 60ft., and at 102 ft. there were _ ‘pro-
nounced indications of heavy ore. This lode
was followed fof a distance of about nine
chains. The indications were that the lode
was underlying at an angle of 35 degrees.
Another ore body was found to the west; it
was followed for nearly eight, chains. Its
depth averaged lsoft. A third lode, the
largest and most important, was followed
with difficulty in a very rough part of the
mountain side at depths of 80 to —0 feet on
the underlay, and was approximately dUtt.
in thickness. This was traced down to the
syndicate’s tunnel, and, if the test is exact,
proves that the lode there worked was even
greater than the syndicate’s expert had
claimed. The tests have excited interest m
mining circles, and subsequent developments
will be watched with interest.

Vegetable Creek, Ardlethan (N.S.W.), is
earning about 10s. a ton on its monthly 950
tons. The four weeks to Nov. 11 accounted tor
089 tons, which returned tons concentrates
valued at £1630. But the pext four weeks
cannot be as good. There has been a break-
down of the grinding-pan, pot to mention
podr spots underground. Lately a w make
has been met in a prospecting shaft lOOtt.
north of the western pipe, and it is opening
up well. It is overlain with 4ft. of soil and
3ft. of good wash, evidently shed by ‘ the
pipe itself.
Two parcels of tin concentrates of the
Great Northern Freehold Co. and Morris’s,
Herberton (N.Q.), containing the one 14
tons and the other 3 tons 3cwt., last month
realised £176 3s. per ton (in all £2466) and
£I7S per ton (£561) respectively. Boom-
ing tin prices are 'bringing prosperity to
these small shows.

F. Reed is doing good business in silver-
lead on the Herberton (N.Q.) field. By
motor-waggons and pack-teams he has been
sending daily 60 tons of silver-lead ore from
the dumps at Mt. Albion to the trucks, thence
to Bonmoo and the Chillag<*3 smelters. Reed
has also started to de-water the old Wein-
hart silver-lead show at Mt. Albion.
The cash came in so well for the Sydney
float of Queensland Tin and Mejtal Mines, to
operate at Ivoorboora and Gurrumbali
(N.Q.), that the 20,000 reserve shares were
released and taken up. Capital now reads
£75,000 in 120,000 contribs. paid to Is. bd.,

Taranaki’s Tarata bore (M.L.) has reached
3955 ft., casing to 3934 ft. The Moiuroa bore
is down to 2367 ft. “There is a fair show
of gas, which burns freely, ’ says the cabled
report. But that is insufficient for the
market, which has slumped, buyers on Mon-
day offering 15s. At latest, Lander (Q-)
was marking time until the cement had set.
A test was then to be made for oil, pro-
bably some time this week. S.A. Oil Wells
has plugged down to 1552 ft., “gas pressure
increasing.” Gas, in fact, seems to be the
chief feature of Australasian shows at the
moment.

Sydnev Siam Tin, Ltd., lias been launched
in 30000 20s. shares, of which half go to
the vendor svndicate and the other half are
publicly held. Sharebroker Philip Cohen
and G. G. Macleod are the head and tail of
the idea, which germinated a year ago. Mac-
leod, a 20-years’ resident of Siam, was told
off to seek out and acquire concessions suit-
able for bucket-dredging. Two areas were
secured from the Siamese Government, aggre-
gating 2400 acres of mineral lands. There
is, however, an intermediate vendor to be
appeased. The monsoonal rains are no joke
in Siam, consequently A. J. Phillips, of the
Ronpibon, who started to bore the areas,
found the job a sort of obstacle race. He
tested about 100 acres of one area ; then the
monsoons got the upper hand. Phillips had
proved about lloz. to an average depth of
29ft., but few of the holes were bottomed.
Boring should be resumed early this month,
provided the sky clears. The present co. is
purely a prospecting venture, with its future
yet to be mapped.

Huey Yot, alias Trang (F.M.S.), which
has been floundering all its life, has decided
to reconstruct. The million 2s. 4d. shares
which are marketable about Is. 6d. will be
converted into 140.000 20s. shares. Of these
70 000 Will be allotted to present holders;
the other 70.000 will be issued as prefer-
ences, carrying 12 p.c., and will be a first
charge on profits until dividends aggregate
100 p.c. If it comes in, the £70.000 of pref.
capital will be used to erect a new steel
bucket dredge and secure an extra 270 acres
of land said to contain 4,000,000 yards of
pound ground.
* * * *
Ratrut Basin (F.M.S.), after several pain-
ful postponements, completed the agreement
for purchase of the area offered by the Siam-
ese Tin Syndicate. It was a case of second
thoughts, because the area taken is portion
of the ground previously negotiated for,
accepted, re-bored and declined. As the Rat-
rut dredge lias commenced in the new ground,
shareholders should soon know whether the
first or the second thought was the better.

“Do you believe prayers arc answered?”
“Well, when I was a kiddie I used to pray
that I'd have longer hair than any of
my friends. And I’ve got it—they all
either bob or shingle.”
“R'una”: Mention of those cheerful sects
which expect the end of the world reminds
me of a well-known M.L. business man whose
obsession was the impending winding-up of
creation on a given day. He was so confi-
dent about it, against the strenuous oppo-
sition of his relatives and friends, that lie
wound up his remunerative business, sold his
house and possessions (the money he left for
the benefit of those unfortunates who, not
being of the elect, were to be left behind on
earth), and with his wife and family went
up to the summit of a local mountain to
await events. When several days had passed
and nothing had happened except that the
family had become sick and tired of their
alpine home, a chastened man clambered
down to earth again with his belongings to
make a fresh start in life. He did it to such
good purpose that when he died recently he
left a well-established business; but there is
nothing the family hates so much as to hear
a mou"tain-top mentioned.

“The Listening Insect”; Sydney's radio
station 2BL, which broadcasts a weekly dis-
course on foreign affairs, has launched a
new scheme. Listeners can now ’phone
their interjections to the station, and by
means of an amplifier the interjection and
the speaker’s reply are both broadcasted.
The scheme might be profitably extended to
the political speeches unloaded on the ether
at election times. Singers and others would
also doubtless be encouraged by a handclap
from Thargomindah or a request for an
encore from back of Bourke. The inno-
vation certainly has points to it.
“A.R.H.”: Coincidences? I was in the
Light Horse on Gallipoli when Abdul shelled
us one day with time shrapnel. I caught a
cobber in my arms as he was falling, hit
in the shoulder. After the evacuation I
joined the artillery, and was on a carrying
party making an advanced observation post
in from Dickebusch. As I was going along
the communication trench, a German shell
wounded an infantryman beside me, and I
propped him up. Then I found it was the
Digger I had caught in my arms on the
Peninsula, and I had never seen or heard
of him since that day. He collected a Blighty
each time.
“Ariston Hudor”: Sydney’s “bubbling
fountains,” where anyone may take his whack
of water hygienically, are so universally re-
garded as a boon and a blessing, especially
to youngsters, that the most ill-conditioned
hooligan would never try to damage them.
But apparently cities have to be educated up
to these refinements of civilisation. A public-
spirited Perth citizen was so impressed with
Sydney’s free drinking-places a few years ago
that he decided to give his own native place
the benefit of similar devices. But no sooner
were the thirst-quenchers installed than the
mechanism was wantonly destroyed, seem-
ingly for no reason except that it was easily
destructible and offered temptation to the
idle hands that are always itching to be in
wanton mischief. The fountains were re-
placed, and the same thing happened again.
Then the philanthropist grew tired of his
beneficence being frustrated by senseless lar-
rikinism, and the consequence is that Perth,
a much thirstier city than Sydney in summer-
time, is still without the cleanest form of
free tap that science has yet devised.

“Witenhana” : The recent suicide of liay-
den, a prisoner in the Terrace Gaol, Wel-
lington (M.L.), who strangled himself in his
cell, although trussed in a strait-jacket,
with feet-straps and handcuffs, was recon-
structed by the prison doctor in the presence
of the Coroner. With hands pinioned to
the belt around his waist, wrists handcuffed
and legs tied with a strap near the ankles,
he was placed on his back on the floor of
the cell. Pulling himself into a sitting posi-
tion, the doctor crossed one ankle over the
other and, drawing his heels under him,
opened his legs with a scissor-like action.
The result was to bring the strap securing
his ankles within reach of his manacled
hands and enable him to loosen the knot.
It was then easy to make a running noose
by passing the point of the strap through the
buckle, and, by holding in the right posi-
tion, to work it over his head so as to en-
circle the neck. A little wriggling brought
the doctor to the wall, where he succeeded
in tying the end of the strap to an iron ring,
from which position a sudden drop back-
wards would do the deed. The Coroner re-
turned a verdict that it did.
“Lignum”: Another few years of Sydney
Sun’s intrepid “explorers” will find our Aus-
tralian youngsters educated up to an old-
world conception of the interior of this
continent. Birtles of the Beaten Tracks still
breaks out occasionally about the potenti-
alities of the Barkly. Tablelands; and the
Terry expedition in quest of pastoral land
and gold-bearing quartz is doing wonders to
help the squatter and miner who have had
a lifelong experience of that country. This
expedition cut out the Tanami track as being
too prosaic for motor explorers who love the
poetry of red*-hot adventure. Still, they
are doing famously—-they tell us they have

Broome, and will probably report a possi-
bility of pearls and pearl-shell in that locality.
Finally, three intrepid voyagers, equipped
with a motor-launch and faultless quarter-
deck costumes (vide Sun portraits), voyaged
from Gundagai to the Murray, meeting en
route a wild pastoralist who invited them
to afternoon tea and billiards. Forty-odd
years ago Shaw, the son of a Coonamble
doctor, set out in a canoe from Gundagai,
alone, and went thi’ough to the ocean, re-

sketches, in the Town and Country Jour-
nal. The last I heard of this adventurous
Aussie was when he and a mate sailed out of
Singapore in a Chinese junk bound for the
’Frisco Exhibition of ’BB. In the early Cool-
gardie days The Bulletin reported the
arrival there, overland from Charleville (Q.),
of a swagman who had footed it across. A
bushman that, if not an explorer from the
big-smoke area.

“Simon”: He was an old-time pug., and,
according to report, a very clever one — “they
couldn’t ’it ’im,” admirers would often re-
count. As licensee of the Sportsmen’s Arms
his pendant lips, gnarled eyebrows, seared
cheeks and cauliflower ears effectively adver-
tised his old calling. One day he refused a
mostly-honorary patron a beer except for
cash in advance. With the bar between, the
man-who-had-his-credit-stopped became con-
fidential. “Couldn’t hit you, couldn’t they?”
he asked scornfully. “Blime, by the look o’
yer dial nobody ever missed you.”
“Hamer”: Fitzroy Gardens, whose various
attractions include many pieces of worsc-
for-wear statuary, appear to be the
playground of Mel-
bourne’s freakish
drunks. Passers-by
in the park one re-
cent morning were
astonished to find
one of the plaster
n ymp h s arrayed
splendidly in a
somewhat tattered
and soiled shirt: a
dilapidated waist-
coat ornamented an
Apollo, and a
frayed boot was
stuck, as though it
was a glove, on the
outstretched hand
of some Venus or
other. How the.
decorator, who had
apparently shed
most of his cloth-
ing in his efforts to
brighten up the
landscape, got home
remains an intriguing mystery.
“Y4R” : Since childhood Bert was always
a stickler for grammatical precision. I met
him coming out of a city restaurant the
other day carrying a gold-mounted umbrella.
“Hullo,” I said. “Did you take the best
one?” .“No!” he corrected me in quite his
old style. “The better one.” And away he
went with his spoil.
“Bris”: A Brisbane “crook drama,” on
which Acting-Judge Dickson rang down the
curtain recently, had all the elements
(barring a bobbed-haired heroine) of a Holly-
wood thriller; incidentally, a picture-show
manager took a
leading part in the
capture of the two
burglars who
cracked a crib near

Hotel so noisily
that they woke up

When asked by the
detective, “Why
did you try to

plied coolly, “I
knew I’d get three
years for house-
breaking, and I’d
get no more for
potting you.” The
usual sentence for
manslaughter in
Queensland is three
years, but in this
case the forecast
was at fault, for
the Acting-Judge
(formerly Crown
Prosecutor) handed
out 10 years for
attempted murder.
This was at the
second trial. At
the first, Faulstrom

“Mako”: Many and ingenious were the
devices adopted by illicit dealers to run
liquor into the big M.L. prohibition area, the
King Country, protected in the interests of
Brown Brother; it took extraordinary alert-
ness on the part of the police to cope with
the traffic. One day an elbow drain-tile fell
from an innocent-looking cart, and when the
broken bits parted there was revealed a tin
snugly fitted insi'de. A woman in one of
the townships purchased a tin of sardines,
and w r as amazed to find the contents liquid ;•
it had got astray from some sly-grog con-
signment. The vinegar-barrel was always
suspect in the King Country, and the police
had regular exercise going round country
stores and investigating the same. When a
plain-clothes sleuth heard that one store-
keeper was doing a large business in bottled
cold-tea he slipped in with well-simulated
caution and, tendering a fl note, asked for

“He got broke.”
a bottle of tea. And that was just what he
sot. But the law's chief triumph was when
a passing policeman noticed a spirituous
whiff from the pram in -which the village
twins were taking their afternoon outing,
and discovered that the innocents were sleep-
ing among a consignment of bottles, one of
which had been broken by a lusty kick.

A QUID PRO QUO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Hill, attacking the Widows’ Pension Bill in
the N.S.W. Assembly, gave it as his opinion that
many widows would refuse offers of marriage if it
meant the loss, of a pound a week.”
Love you? It puzzles me a bit what more you
By way of proof or evidence should seek.
Isn’t it obvious that I adore you —
Words are weak whispers only; actions speak—
When I shall soon be sacrificing for you
My steady windfall of a pound a week?
More, if what Mr. Hill asserts were true,
Than many a widow would be game; to do.
Back of my mind was always an intention
To take another ticket in the sweep
Of wedlock. But the Government’s subvention
Made me, I tell you freely, think a heap.
I put you in the scales against the pension ;
Now you can never say I held you cheap,
You who a rustling note a week outweighed
In my affections, when the choice was made.
Some spinster, springier and ultra-slender,
With waist, mayhap, that measures less around,
Might in your keeping place a heart more tender
Than mine—she’d make it seem so, I’ll be bound,
With blushes hot —but think what I surrender,
A pound a week, a whole entrancing pound,
Reckless of worldly wisdom and the shrill
Contentions of the cynic Mr. Hill.
Love you? Need momentary doubts beset you?
Nothing’s so patent as what can’t be hid.
See what I cheerfully resign to get you,
Observe the sum that in cold cash I bid !
Some women would assess your worth, I’ll bet you,
At less than the equivalent of a quid
A week. But mine beneath love’s spell I throw
Back to the Government. And you’re the quo.

“Riwaka”: Just when some of us want
to shut him up altogether, the Melbourne City
Council is being extra-kind to the soap-box
orator. No longer on Sunday afternoons does
the advocate of revolution or the apostle of
a strange religion have to carry his own
box to the Yarra Bank. The council has
saved him the trouble by providing 14 ready-
made platforms. These are circles of big
stones filled in with hard-rammed earth.
They are about sft. across and 18in. high,
except one, which is a double decker with
a much larger circle for base. Considering
some past scenes on Yarra Bank, it is well
that the stones are too big and heavy to
handle easily.

“Bilbav”: One night in October, 1919, two
or three other ex-A.I.F. men ami myself,
members of the North Russian Relief Force,
camped in a blockhouse in the support line
of the Vologda front in Archangel. Heat
and mosquitoes made sleep almost impossible,
so we lay and listened to a big Russian in-
fantryman playing the same tume over and
over again on the balalaika, a haiunting, mel-
ancholy Russian air that I shall ne|ver forget. I
never heard it again in Russia, but a couple
of days ago it came into my head in a Pyr-
mont (Sydney) wool-store whede I earn a
crust, and I began whistling ift. To my

surprise the air was taken up by a chap
near me, and he and I finished it off to-
gether. As the firm might disapprove of its
employees discussing Russian music in work-
ing hours, I waited until lunch-time to tap
him for particulars. He proved to be a
Finn (from Helsingfors), and was on the
Murmansk coast when our little show was on
—with the opposition force. But we buried the
hatchet while he whistled several other tunes
I’d heard there and forgotten. The one T
luul remembered, I learned, was called
“Ivan,” and was vary popular in Russia
after the revolution. My acquaintance got
the shock of his life when he heard it in
Sydney; he assured me that he didn’t think
there was any Australian who knew it. He
himself had pulled out of Russia in 1920
owing to overmuch Bolshevism and insuffi-
ciency of tucker.

“Hasen”: A motor-car, travelling along
Breakfast Creek-road, Brisbane, the other
night, swerved and collided with a tram.
The car was overturned, badly smashed; the
driver was thrown clear and suffered no
more than scratches and a shaking. He was
soon on his feet and back to see what damage
had been done. A crowd had already gath-
ered about the capsize. Someone said ; “He’s
under the car.” Surprised to hear that
anyone else had been involved in the smash,
the owner, still dazed, lent a willing hand
in the rescue work that followed. They had
righted the thing and groped among the
wreckage before he realised that the crowd
iiad missed his flight from the car, and that
he had been energetically aiding in a search
for himself.
“Julian”: At the close of the Russo-Jap.
War, when the news of the fall of Port
Arthur was received at Kalgoorlie, the local
Japanese decided to celebrate their triumph
over Russia. They ordered a liberal supply
of beer to be delivered at one of the public
parks, and word was passed round that drinks
would be free at 7 o’clock. A band was
engaged to march through the town, and the
tallest man in Kalgoorlie—-he was 6ft. Tin.—
was engaged as drum-major. The miners,
however, objected to the little brown men
rubbing it into their European opponents in
such fashion; so at nightfall they went to
the park and turned on the taps, so that the
beer ran to waste. Further, they advised the
union which controlled the band to Jock up
the instruments; and finally they hinted to
the drum-major (a local chemist) that his
shop-windows would be in danger if he led
the “Banzai” crowd. There was no jubila-
tion that night except in the laundries and
yoshiwaras.

“0.V.Q.”: Whenever the China boat
arrived at a North Queensland port an old
Scottish identity, arrayed in kiits and with
pipes under his arm, would go aboard to treat
the passengers to a “wee bit skirl.” After
passing round the hat he would disappear
below, presumably to fraternise with the
crew. Nemesis was a long time coming, but
one day Scotty, who had partaken of a few
whiskies, was steering an erratic course down
the gangway on his way ashore when a
Customs officer, thinking to steady him a
little, placed his hand on the bag of the
pipes. What he felt led to a prompt arrest;
and the fine for smuggling opium made quite
a hole in Scotty’s bank account.

“Oxmead” : A war yarn which I have met
in print a dozen scene is generally
laid in Egypt—is that dealing with the
alleged experience of a British (sometimes
he is ail Australian)
officer of high rank who
saw service in the Boer
War. It was his pride,
so the story runs, to
parade veterans from the
ranks who had also par-
ticipated in the hammer-
ing of Paul, and he in-
sisted on them wearing
their medals, if they had
any. On one df these
occasions a man was
noticeable whose breast
was bare of decorations.
“I thought I’d better dip
them,” he vouchsafed in
reply to the officer's in-
quiry as to where the
medals were. “Oh, yes,
I was in the Boer War
all right, but, you see, I
was on the Boer side.”
There are variants of the
yarn, but the central
figure is always the same
—the man who had re-
ceived medals for fighting
against Britain, not for
her. No doubt there were
soldiers in the Great War
who had given the two
South African republics
a hand a dozen years be-
fore. But what I am
dubious about is whether
the Kruger and Steyn
Governments ever gave
war medials to anyone. Did they ,

“Rizzle*”: Re the yarn (B. 5/11/’2o)
a b ou t the Yankee windjammer that lobbed
i nto Geraldton (Q.)—now Innisfail—m mis-
take for Geraldton (W.A.). Many years ago
j was a lad on the Newcastle (W.A.)
Heraed, where it was my privilege to report
the debates of the local council, ihe pro-
prietor of onlr paper had long been advocating
a change of name for the town, but he never
had much h(ck with lus crusade until one
day he published an advertisement which
obviously was intended not for us, but tor
some paper in the N.S.W. seaport. the
advertisement called for tenders for the sup-
ply of several thousands of tons of coal to
one of the shipping companies in Sydney,
and as our Newcastle seldom saw any coal
except the occasional hunk a passing engine-
driver would throw at somebody’s train-
wrecking cow, the populace started
at the newspaper proprietor. He turned the
tables on them in a leading article which
rated the community for not ending this
ONCE BIT.
“ I’ll meet you, at the Civil Service at eleven.”
“That’ll suit me fine —if you say what time you will he there.”
“deplorable confusion whereby one of the
fairest agricultural districts in this con-
tinent is being begrimed through the smutty
reputation of a town of the same name in
another State.” Presently the Mayor called
a meeting of ratepayers to discuss a letter
from Andrew Fisher, then Prime . Minister,
which intimated that the postal inconveni-
ence would be reduced by changing the name
of Newcastle (W.A.) to something else.
An irate councillor arose and said that “we
been Noocarstle fer seventy year now, an’
’son’y lately I heerder ’sotlier place—let ’em
change tli’ namer thother Noocarstle; they're
’tothersiders, anyway.” A humorist followed
with an alleged press telegram which re-
corded that rape had been discovered in the
crops in Newcastle, New South. “If we
don’t change our name the world will think
we have rape in our crops, and our business
will suffer. Perhaps we shan’t be able to
sell our hay,” he added. The objecting
councillor thereupon withdrew his objections,
and our good old Groper town was formally
re-christened Toodyay, which everybody who
doesn’t know any better (particularly 'tother-
siders) pronounces as it is spelt, whereas
it is “Too-gee” if it is anything.
* * * *
“Billiken”: Waiting for lunch, I once
strolled round the back yard of a remote
pub on the West Coast-road, Eyre’s Penin-
sula (S.A.). In the shed was an old coach
of the style used in the days of George IV.
It seemed to be acting as a feedbox-cwm-
licnroost. I cleaned up a coat-of-arms on the
door-panel and questioned Bung, but he knew
nothing about the vehicle and cared less.
Back in Adelaide, I looked up a Burke’s Peer-
age, and found the coat-of-arms to be that
of the Byron family. Further investigation
showed that the coach had belonged to the
father of the poet, and had been brought here
by one of the early Governors. I interested
Dr. Todd, of Adelaide, who made the trip over
to inspect. He thought the Museum ought
to have it, and tried to buy, but Bung pre-
ferred to keep it as a hehroost. I often
wonder what was its ultimate fate.
* * * *
“Percy I’inktape”: The lodging-house
which double-lets its rooms, allowing night-
watchman Brown to occupy during the day-
time the couch whereon White, the bread-
carter, snores through the night hours, is a
modern inconvenience which leaves some
people more money for beer, bets and bad-
ness • and the double-banking has had a curi-
ous variation in an East Melbourne instance.
A Scotch husband took his wife to live, in
a single room at East Melbourne. Being
a night-porter, he occupied the single bed
during the day-time while his wife was away
working; it reverted to the lady at night;
between whiles she cooked his tea (which
was her breakfast) and his breakfast (which
was her tea) on an oil-stove. In the course
of a maintenance suit the wife asserted that,
penurious us her helpmate was regarding
house-rent, he earned £5 a week and had been
able to lend bis mother-in-law £.>oo. On
bis part, the husband alleged that his wife
had banked sufficient of her own earnings
to pay for a trip to Scotland. Both stones
were admitted true. It was just thrift
run wild.

“Kir”: At St. John’s Church, Parramatta,
there is a register which has been in use
since the historic tabernacle was opened at
the end of the eighteenth century. The first
entry records a marriage celebrated by the
Rev.’ Richard Johnson, Australia’s pioneer
parson; since tlien over 8000 entries have
been made of baptisms alone. Some queer
requests come to the keepers of the records.
Apart from inquiries from lawyers who are
trying to locate missing heirs or establish
the title of claimants to property, there
arrive such surprises as oil one occasion an
offer of £r>oo to erase a certain entry.
* * * *
“Stellsby”: The strike bug crawls into
strange places. Every spring, when the
snapper season is due, the Tic. Ports and
Harbors Department begins blasting opera-
tions in the Rip, at the Port Phillip entrance,
thus destroying tons of valuable fish. Re-
cently the fishermen who comprise the Queens-
cliff lifeboat crew hit on the novel idea of
declaring the new motor lifeboat ordered
from Adelaide black as a protest against
this departmental folly. The plan answered;
the blasters have retired, and the boat is
white again.
* * * *
“T. 0.1.”: Politics have sometimes been
responsible for lawyers changing professional
sides with bewildering rapidity. Many years
ago, when W. B. Dailey was Attorney-General
in the Robertson Ministry, he appeared for
the plaintiff in support of a will alleged to
be that of one Robert Hancock, a noted
citizen of liis day. The jury found the
will to be a forgery, and four persons were
committed for- trial, one of the accused being
accepted as a Crown witness. Dailey, as
Attorney-General, filed the bill against the
accused'; but when the Robertson Govern-
ment vacated office lie held a brief tor the
principal offender. Similarly, G. H- Reid,
when Attorney-General, filed a bill against
a man for murder. Then there was a
change of Government, and Reid was found
defending the accused. He managed to in-
duce the jury to make it manslaughter, too.

JOE CLARK.
Labor member for
Warnmerawa
(N.S.W.).
and has done good
work as President
of the Taxpayers’
Association of S.
Aus. Last April
he was elected Pre-
sident of the Adel-
aide Chamber of
Commerce ; and for
more than 20 years
he has been a mem-
ber of the ground
and finance com-
mittees o f th e
Cricket Associa-
tion. He is a trus-
tee of the State
Savings Bank and
a director of sev-
eral big companies.
Walter Parsons, who has recovered for
the Liberals the Aligns (S.A.) seat which
Paddy Glynn lost to Moses Gabb two Par-
liaments back, is a half-brother of Judge
Parsons, of the S. Aus. Supreme Court
bench. Their father, J. L. Parsons, was a
politician of the last generation and a real
orator in a style now seldom heard ; at one
time he was Administrator of the N.T. when
Darwin was an outlying district of South
Alls. The new member, who is in trade on
his own account, is a hustling featherweight,
equally fond of talking and work, who has
been secretary to various Liberal branches
in Adelaide suburbs.
Having failed to capture Indi for Labor,
David Black is back in his old job as a Vic.
State-school teacher. The Department held
over his resignation when he lodged it be-
fore nomination day, and he was allowed to
withdraw it and be deemed to have been
on leave without pay. In his spare time he
is president of the Vic. N. S. Teachers’ Union.
Perhaps he will now give politics the go-by.
It isn’t every teacher who can capture a
Parliamentary seat as easily as Bond,
M.L.A., did Glenelg.
An Australian with a remarkable record
is Dr. Edward E. Johnson, who started at
17 to earn his living as a laborer on the
Waranga Basin Reservoir, Victoria, shipped
a year later as a seaman, and has now re-
turned a scientist with a wide reputation and
a director of both the Standard Oil and the
Hudson Bay companies—and still under 50.
After a year or two at sea, and a year or
two more on land, he entered the Govern-
ment Medical School at Washington, con-
cluded his course at the Philippine Islands
School of Tropical Medicine, and then
entered the ’Frisco College of Physicians,
where he became professor of pathology, tie
had a surprise on his arrival in Fremantle;
on the wharf he recognised a sister whom he
had not seen for 25 years.
T. E. Meek, secretary to the Vic. Treasury,
got a lift last week by being made chairman
of the new Superannuation Board —it came
on his GOtli birthday. He already draws
£lOOO a year, and will receive about £250
extra for the few hours a w T eek he will have

“Cue”: Touching the “Napoleonic craze”
(B. 12/11/’25) a much more distinguished
Australian than John Norton who cultivated
it was John Forrest. Not that, like Norton
(and Northcliffe), he ever affected to detect
any physical or facial resemblance between
himself and the Corsican, but he often
admitted to a keener and more profound
admiration for N. Bonaparte than for any
other man who had made history. He had
a fine collection of Napeoleonic literature
and a firm conviction that Britain never
treated an enemy more harshly than the
person it shut up at St. Helena. There was
a story that on one of his visits to London
Forrest was invited to a dinner given by
Lord Glenesk, previously Sir Algernon
Bortliwiek. of the Morning Post, and that
he refused any hospitality from such a
quarter because Lady Glenesk was a direct
descendant of Sir Hudson Lowe, Napoleon's
not particularly amiable gaoler.
President Coolidge will have to find wall
space of 5040 square inches somewhere in
the Capitol at Washington for the picture of
the American Armada in Sydney Harbor for
which Charles Bryant, R. 0.1., Australia’s
marine painter, has got a commission. The
acreage—the size was suggested by Lister
Lister —will be a semi-official gift from this
country, and Bryant, in expectation of the
job, made many sketches of our visitors dur-
ing the hectic fortnight.
George Ernest Roberts, who was for 44
months (1903-04) member for Richmond in
Vic. Assembly, was knocked down by a
motor-car and killed at East St. Ivilda last
week. A barber with a ready tongue, he got
his Parliamentary chance when Trenwith
left the Assembly to become a Senator. He
sat in the House for only one night, and the
rest, of his term was recess. Unmindful of
Christmastide, Roberts, during the few hours
he was in the Chamber, attacked the Police
Department on slender evidence, and earned
the contempt of Irvine, who was then Pre-
mier. Indirectly Irvine was the means of
wiping him out. as the Reform Act gave
only one member to Richmond, and that
constituency chose George Bennett.
Gyle Soilleux. who has just had a show of
etchings in Melbourne, is an adventurous
youth. Not many boys, even in these days,
pick up a job as ship’s wireless operator as
soon as they leave school. Soilleux did, and
roamed the high seas for two years before
coming home to go through his articles as
an architect. While at the ’Varsity he dis-
tinguished himself by his hammer-throwing,
tor which he was awarded full blue, and for
his etchings and and sketches, with which, in
lus capacity as Art Editor, he adorned the
University Magazine. At present he de-
v°tes much of his spare time to yachting,
and his nights to etching. A trip to Paris
and London is planned for next year.
Morris Jacobs and his wife, of Geelong,
must hold the Australian record for long-
distance matrimony : on November 20 they
celebrated the 72nd anniversary of their
wedding. Ten children were born to them :
they have outlived all but three. Mr. Morris
is approaching his 09th milestone; his wife
is four years younger.
South. Aus. has lost two good sportsmen.
Peter Goudie had been associated with racing
for nearly 40 years, and helped to build up
the Port Adelaide Club. Latterly he did a
lot of handicapping for it and other clubs as
far away as Broken Hill. W. F. Challenger
was still more widely known. As a young
man he went over from S.A. to the West-
ralian gold rush, was a carrier on the Norse-
man track and joined the Light Horse for
the Boer War. Back in Kalgoorlie, he was
for years chairman of the goldfields cricket
and football associations. About five years
ago he retired to his native State; he was
only “>0 at the end.
The Flemington seat in the Vic. Assembly
was an easy snap for J. J. Holland. secre-
tary of the local Labor Branch. He was
‘"pre-selected” late on Wednesday night
(Nov. 25), and was declared elected at noon
on Friday (Nov. 27). The Nats, came to the
conclusion that it would be a waste of effort
to put anyone in the field. They will wait
for the better chance that redistribution (if
it comes next year) may give. Holland is
regarded as one of Labor’s intellectuals. It
can do with some in public places.
Supt. D. Linehan, who is on the point of
retiring from the Vic. police force because
he is just on 60, had the disagreeable duty
of handling the first reports that came to
hand showing that a man found in a sus-
pected sly-grog shop, scantily-clad, had
flourished Medal No. SO, which belongs to
Chief Commissioner Blarney. Blarney says
that he wasn’t there, and that his medal was
stolen from him and then dropped into the
letter-box of his club. Linehan and Blarney
appear to have differed as to the mode of
investigation and on other points, and Chief
Secretary Argyle deputed the senior officer
of the service (Inspccting-Supt. Warren) to
make inquiries, which were resultless. While
accepting Blarney’s explanation, Argyle says
that he can have a public inquiry if lie
wants it. As Blarney claims to have a com-
plete alibi (Col. W. Farr is one strong wit-
ness for him), it is a wonder he did not
demand a public inquiry weeks ago. That
would have stopped the cackle.
Another Vic. school-teacher to make good
in another sphere is Alex. Jessep, a farmer’s
son and a product of the Sale Agricultural
High School. He entered the Teachers’ Col-
lege in 1914 to study agriculture, but 1916
saw him in khaki: after having risen to the
rank of staff-captain in France he returned
in December, 1919, to resume liis studies at
the University. These he completed last year
with the Degrees of B.Sc. and M.Agr.Sc.,
being the second Victorian to secure the
latter honor. Now, at 32, he is to be Direc-
tor of the School of Agriculture and Lec-
turer in Agriculture at the University.
11. C. Malcolm was for 40 years one of
the best-known of A r ic. public officers. As
a Lands Department inspector he had to
roam over big tracts of country; and as
inspector of charities he had oversight of all
institutions from the Murray to the ocean.
He lived to see his son Norman, an ex-
soldier who is third member of the Closer
Settlement Board, assisting to do many
things he would have liked to do himself.
For seven years lie drew the modest pension
of £384. and was just on 72 when he got
the call from aloft.
Adelaide University Senate (which in
S.A. means the whole body of graduates)
has held a brisk election for the Council,
the administrative body. Five members re-
tiring in rotation, J. R. Fowler alone did
not seek re-election, and four fresh names
came forward. Vice-chancellor Mitchell,
Bayley (head of Prince Alfred’s) and Isbis-
ter, K.C., were all reappointed; but Talbot
Smith was dropped, after over 20 years’
service. The new members are both young :
Edward Holden, manager of the big motor-
body manufacturing co., and Archie Price,
head .of the new residential college, St.
Mark’s. All three of the defeated candidates
are lawyers.
Alick McGregor, accountant of the
Queensland Justice Department, has the big
job of keeping in order the auctioneers and
commission-agents in the State—faboiit 1300
of them. These agents are rigorously regu-
lated in Queensland; each has to put up a
fidelity bond or cash deposit of £5OO before
he can obtain a license, and this is estreated
if he is caught indulging in any “funny busi-
ness.” A brave man was wanted to admin-
ister file Act, so the job was given to “Fight-
ing Mac,” who was formerly a captain in
the A.I.F. As accountant of the Justice
Department, one of his queer side-lines is
the cashing of tote tickets which absent-
minded punters have forgotten to present
at the racecourse.
Captain James Henry Gibbon, of Port
Adelaide, who lias passed out in his 90th
year, obtained his master’s certificate as far
back as 1862. He was engaged in the China
trade and had remarkable adventures with
pirates and other undesirables. The Cathay,

Darwin lost its oldest resident on Nov. 1,
when Mrs. Eliza Sarah Brown was killed
in a driving accident. The lady, the widow
of Victor Voules Brown, had lived in Dar-
win for .55 years, having been brought to
Darwin by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. E.
Tuckwell, in 1870, when she was a child of
two. She left a grown-up family of nine,
all Territory-born, and a number of grand-
children. The other victim of the driving
accident, who died on Nov. 3, was the widow
of the late D. S. Byers, who was lost near
Bradshaw’s run five years ago, and of whom
no trace was ever found. She was daughter
of “old Mrs. Mansfield,” known to all resi-
dents of the Territory as “Gran,” and a resi-
dent of the N.T. for almost 30 years. The
two ladies, who were close friends, were
buried side by side in the new cemetery at
Darwin.
Port Augusta (S.A.) is having a munici-
pal jubilee. But its real history goes back
much more than half a century. Flinders
in 1802 took a scornful look at the site of
it when he found to his disappointment that
Spencer’s Gulf does not go clean through
Australia. In 1552 Captain Dowsett, with
Elder and Grainger, of the S.A. Legislative
Council, butted through the dense mangrove-
swamp at the head of the gulf and found
“hard ground, a fine beach and deep water."
It was named after the wife of Governor
Young. Augusta Marryat, niece of the
novelist —one of the very first Murray steam-
boats was also called after her. Torrens,
the framer of the Real Property Act, claimed
the whole district under a “preliminary land
order” oustanding from the foundation of
S.A., but withdrew. The town had a boom
and a slump, but has steadily gone ahead
since the East-West railway came, and will
be an important junction some day.
Not everybody who does remarkable things
in a motor-car does it for advertising pur-
poses. The other day Wm. Henry Darton
Avery, a fine old pioneer of the Monaro, was
dying, at 81, and two of his five sons spun
down from Longreach to Cooma, 1394 miles,
in 48 hours driving time.
A new and rather shuddersome animal
story, told by just returned Governor
Bridges, of S.A., to an interviewer in
London :
I have just visited a private menagerie and called
on my pet lion, Poilu, the mascot of my division
iii France. He used to roam through the trenches,
and was a friend of all the boys until he became too
big and had to be sold for the Red Cross. When
my leg had to be amputated the nurse asked me
before the operation if I had any special wish—in
case. etc. “Yes.” I replied, “give mv leg to
Poilu. He hasn’t had any meat to-day.” And to-day
he knew me again at once, after an absence of
three years. Perhaps it is his gratitude for that
repast which causes him to remember me so well.
M. P. Considine, ex-M.H.R.. anti-capital-
ist:. formerly a sort of deputy-soviet, consul
for Australia, left Broken Hill a week or
so back after getting exemption from labor
conditions on his mine “in order to raise
more capital.” The capital of this anti-
capitalist being tied up in poultry-farms,
landed estate, etc., lie naturally wants a little
time to raise enough to develop a Barrier
silver-lead mine. It takes more than a bob
or two to do that.
RETROSPECT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We was buzzin’ along the back Port-road
In a forty-h.p. ’bus
At somethin’ like thirty mile an hour,
An’ Jim says: “’Ow do yer like ’er power?
She’ll rip across the Majuba Hill
W’ile them poor beggars is standin’ still,
An’ never a mite o’ fuss !”
But, Lor’, I was watchin’ a patch o' scrub
An’ a ruined limestone 'ut
As I ’adn’t been near' for thirty year,
An’ the sight o’ them turned my ’end that queer
I didn’t catch ’alf the things ’e said ;
My mind was just like an empty shed
With the doors an’ winders shut.
The last time I come along this track
I was ridin’ to church with Em.
She was on Darky an’ me on Turk,
Both flash as kittens from want o’ work,
An’ the j'eller boronia smellin’ sweet,
And the spear-grass blowin’ beneath their feet;
An’ we as gay as them.
It was in September in ’ninety-five,
An’ the early- hay was cut.
An’ Emily Smith was wearin’ my ring,
An’ ’er ’air was black as a magpie’s wing
An’ ’er eyes was blue as the shinin’ sky,
An’ she looked that tender an’ sweet an’ shy
As we passed the lime-stone ’ut!
“I told yer ’ow she could pull,” says Jim,
As we topped the ’Juba Hill;
“Dad says it useter take six good nags
To git over that with twenty bags!”
An’ ’e looked at me with Emily's ej-es.
Jim’s ’er eldest, an’ twice ’er size.
She married Steve o’ the Mill.

ABORIGINALITIES
MADE IN AUSTRALIA
BARNES-LINSEED OIL
"Morob : When the New 7 Guinea native
wishes to keep a count of the numbers involved in
some happening, his favorite method is to collect, a
bundle of sticks or a pile of pebbles, which can be
put away and referred to when necessary. The
i.umber of men killed in an inter-village fight is thus
ieeordod by a bundle of sticks. In some parts a
progressive stage has been reached, a separate
counter —a pebble or a shell —being used for every 7
group of 10. But the counting is not done bv
reckoning up the total first, and. then using the shell
or pebble to represent each 10, with sticks for those
left over. Instead, the whole of the count is first
made in sticks, and then every lot of 10 sticks
is replaced by one of the higher counters. This is
the only 7 way by 7 which the native can arrive at the
desired result, and probably it took him a° , es to
get .that far.
* X- * *
“F.A.H.”: Marmots, as bandicoots arc
called in New Guinea, are much relished by the
natives, and in the Astrolabe Bay district elaborate
traps are prepared for them. The ’coots come in
from the bush to the grasslands at. night to feed
on the fallen fruit from the wild figs. Wing fences
are built, one on each side of a selected fig-tree, about
30 or 40 y 7 ards apart, and converging at some dis-
tance on a complicated network of tiny pens. These
fences are about 2ft. in height, closely woven of
twigs and strips of bamboo. Late on a dark even-
ing a line of natives takes up a position across
the base of the triangle formed by the two fences,
and with flaming torches drives the marmots into
the apex where the pens are built.

“Phone”: A Bulletin par. by “G.F.”
some months ago, that pearl-stealing is still rife
in Broome, needs correction in so far as white em-
ployees are concerned. Most shell-openers know
that they are remarkably lucky if they receive 2 5
per cent, of the value of the stolen pearl from the
snide buyer, and as the ruling commission on finds
is 15 per cent, the difference is not likely to tempt
them from the straight path. Apart from finance,
the majority of shell-openers have had enough knock-
ing about Australia and other lands to appreciate
the decent treatment they receive from 90 per cent,
of the master pearlers. They realise that they are
paid solely for their honesty, the actual work of
opening shell occupying only about two hours per
day. “G.F.’s” long connection with colored openers
may ha\e led him to believe to the contrary.
“Coolabah”: An approxi-
mate forecast of the coming
season may be made by
any observant bush-dweller who
lias had experience. Cultivated
flowers and crops will bloom
and seed when the usual time is
at hand in spite of the weather,
but the wild flowers and trees
are influenced by rainfall. In
good seasons the spring comes
early, and its arrival is assured
more by 7 the presence of wild
blooms than by that of a few
wann days. When the little
white-and-purple snowdrops are
seen in early August and simul-
taneously the wattle is breaking
its buds, the observant N.S.W.
tableland farmer knows that his
crops will be full. This year,
in spite of the flooding rains,
spring has almost been skipped
in some parts of N. S. Wales.
The wild flowers bloomed late,
the cuckoo came late, the birds
left their building late—and we
were soon facing a drought.
“Coppertop”: “Herodot’s” par re killing
rats with chlorine gas (B. 29/10/’25) brings to
mind a question to which I have wanted an answer
for some time. When going through gas-training in
England we had to enter a small galvanised-iron shed
which housed a clilorine-gas outfit. With masks on,
we faced this gas for five minutes; then, removing
the protection, we walked out into the open air,
holding breath till we were well clear of the chlorine.
For the purpose of illustrating the effects of the gas,
we collected rats, mice, lizards and frogs and took
them into the chamber with us. When the gas
was turned on, the rats, mice and lizards took the
full count in less than two seconds, but the frogs
refused to die. One big frog was given a mouthful
of the liquid, but he just spluttered, and, having
expelled the stuff, hopped off to the fresh air. We
caught him and kept him under observation for over
a month. W hy r was the frog immune ?
* * * »
“Nitric”: Drought has stricken many
flocks of sheep in West Queensland, and to add to
the losses the Darling pea is again making its
ravages. This plant belongs to a well-known stock-
poison plant of the indigo variety. A plant closely
allied to the pea—-a triennial of six inches to
several feet high, with pea-like flowers varying in
color from white to purplish pink—is also doing
damage on the Darling Downs. The pea has the
same effect on animals as the stagger weed. The
symptoms are first a marked stupidity, then stiff-
ness and staggering and, finally, paralysis. A curious
characteristic of the poisoning is that; the animals,
on coming to the smallest obstacle, such as a twig,
will step over it as if it were a foot high. The
Darling pea can be used as fodder when it is very
young (from four to six weeks), but later than this
causes death.
LESE-MAJESTY.
“ Say, old chap, I want to find a J.P.; you're one, ain't you?”
“ Er — yes; I have the honor to he.”
“Well, would you mind stickin? your monocle on this?”
“Jimmy Possum”: A few months back, in
response to an SOS, a couple of well-meaning Abo.-ites
advised me to try tartarate of antimony and tartar-
emetic—one and the same stuff, according to the
drug-“diddler”—mixed with honey, for a small black
ant that has taken possession of our house. I specu-
lated a bob and obtained a supply, mixed it with
golden syrup and placed it in a jam-tin where the
invaders would be sure to find it. In less than a
couple of hours they were swarming over the walls
in thousands, breaking their necks to get at the
offering. Then the pilgrimage to the jam-tin sud-
denly ceased. Every drop of the dope had disappeared,
and at the bottom of the container, lay the killing-
powder—every grain of it. It had not dissolved,
though thoroughly mixed, and the ants had very
carefully left it behind. Would some good-hearted
toxicologist tell me how 7 to mix the stuff so that the
ants w 7 on’t be able to separate it from honey or
jam?
-X * * *
“W.P.T.” : A friend of mine was stricken
with dysentery -while in the South Sea Islands. The
one available doctor had given him up, and the
patient as a last resource tried eating a ground-up
acorn. This had been suggested to him many
years before by an old islander while they were con-
versing under the Sydney Domain oak-trees. He
picked two acorns off the ground and put them in
his pocket. They were the seeds that afterwards
saved his life. On returning to Sydney he gathered
a bagful of acorns and at the request of the doctor sent
them to him. Later lie heard of many cures
effected with them.
INSTRUCTIONS NEEDED.
“A haircut, please.'”
"Yes, sir; which one?”
“Maske”: I was woolelassing on a Mur-
chison (VV’.A.) sheeprun this year. The pickers-up
were mostly boys, who wanted full wages, though
most of them were not quite 18. One chap butted
in with the remark that he was 18 but was getting
a man’s wages, and pulled out his agreement to
prove it. His name was Eighteen. Does anyone
else know of a person having a numeral name?
“Parakioro”: “Papi” asks (B. 5/11/’25)
for information about
earthquake psychists.
1 happen to be one; «o
was my mother before
me, she being always
affected with a feeling
of nausea immediately
prior to a quiver.
Having spent practi-
cally 7 all my life in the
Shaky Isles, my ex-
periences of these
wei r d premonitions
have been many and
varied. My most vivid
recollection is of an
occasion when T awoke
about 2 a.m. from a
sound slumber, roused
and warned my wife,
walked into another
room in which my
little daughter wa s
sleeping, and carried
her on to the veran-
dah just as a violent
shake commenced to
play skittles with a
chimney, part, of wdiieh
presently fell on the
child’s bed. On an-
other occasion, sitting
with some friends
reading in a room up-
stairs, I astonished
them by picking up
the high - stemmed
kerosene-lamp from the
table, walking to the
door and throwing it
over the balcony rail-
ing. The explanation
of my strange behavior
arrived about 10 sec-
onds later. As to the
•why and wherefore of
this foreboding, I can
advance no theory;
but it is comparable to
a feeling of apprehen-
sive “calm before the
storm.”
“Up North”: Twice I’ve seen a hungry
aho. who had thrust his arm into a burrow up Cape
\°rk Peninsula way jerk back with a sharp exclama-
tion. Quickly examining the tiny punctures, he
has grunted with satisfaction and casually sucked
the wounds; then, twisting a bunch of' buffalo-
grass around the hand for protection, he has dived
his arm in again and triumphantly dragged out
the snake that had bitten him. In each case the
nigger not only told me, as soon as he had glanced
at the punctures, that the snake was non-poisonous,
but also described the reptile. The abos. always
carefully examine the mouth of a burrow before
exploring it. But sometimes there are no tell-tale
tracks.
“Battleaxe” : Re “Kobbi’s” par. relating to
the derivation of the term “Murray” applied to
abos. (B. 15/10/’25). Even here on the Lower
Burdekin (N.Q.) the term is in general use. “Ivobbi”
is quite right in suggesting that the term is the
Aussie’s lazy way of pronouncing “Murree.” “Mur-
ree” means boys in most abo. dialects up this way.
"Xamilc”: I would like some of the
champions of the crow to pay a visit to any cfow-
infested sheeprun whilst lambing is going on, and
note the luck a new-born lamb requires to escape
destruction by the black horrors. Ceaseless warfare
against the crow is the sheepman’s religion, and is
his only hope for big lambing returns. It is in the
early hours, from dawn to sunrise, that the crow
gets in his most deadly work, especially in frosty
weather, when lambs are slow to find their legs.
Most stations have a good man camped in each lamb-
ing paddock, whose job is to practically live with
the ewes, and who is out at streak of dawn scaring
tire birds, poisoning carcases and assisting the ewes
in any difficult births. In 25 years’ experience
1 have never seen the crow do one useful act. From
stealing a camper s soap to picking out the eves
of valuable animals in distress he is consistently and
übiquitously annoying and mischievous. During grass-
hopper plagues he sits about, waiting the day when
the ’hopper lias reduced stock to the weakness
of starvation. Then it is his turn. In drought time
he flocks to every drying waterhole, trusting to
the mud to hold some impoverished unfortunate. Next
to the crow as a lamb-eradicator is the wedge-tailed
eagle. I have watched a couple of them flapping
along tlie ground behind a motherless lamb that had
got adrift from the flock until it fell exhausted.
But they don’t always wait for lambs to lie down.
The youngster has no hope once the wedge-tail gets
its talons in. The netting trap with covered top
mentioned by a recent abo. scribe is about the best
so far produced for crows, and contrary to general
opinion a lot can be done by making incisions in
carcases for bait and pouring in small quantities of
any patent rabbit-poison containing phosphorus.
Strychnine or arsenic is no good.

A SOLDIER COCKY’S SONG.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A considerable amount was owing for rates, par-
ticularly by soldier settlers, on most of whom final
notices have had no effect. In such cases the
Under secretary for Lands has advised us to get an
order from the Court, which will enable us to sell
their land to men who are not returned soldiers.
The Lands Department will not interfere, provided
its interests are safeguarded.” —Shire cleric's report
nt, a N.S.W. Shire Council meeting.
I rode to the township yesterday to order a set of
tines,
A couple of spares and a set of shares and a pair of
tandem lines.
But the agent flung me a haughty glance ; he thought
I was somewhat fash.
As he wiped his brow, "You can have them now,” he
said, “but the terms are cash !
I mustn’t permit these things to flit—well, not to a
soldier’s farm—
Unless he’s equipped with the cash to pay 7 for the
goods we suffer to go his way.
You fellows, I much regret to say, are doing your-
selves much harm.
“We’ve given you every fighting chance, we’ve
helped you along the road ;
We’ve given you land and the welcome hand and the
means to cari'y your load;
But we get no thanks for the sound advice we’ve
scattered about your feet,
For the colored prints and the helpful hints on
methods of raising wheat.
There’s many a good civilian, mind, that never had
half y 7 our chance.
We studied y 7 our wants and helped you fine while
you were away in Palestine
Or dodging around in the firing-line with the Digger
crowds in France.”
But who cares? I’m quite accustomed now to the
knocks, nor do I fret.
Though I look as mild as a simple child I am not
quite punctured yet.
The threats drift in and 1 file them all; they are
fraught with import dread—
A MISS.
’ARDCASE 'ARRY : “Could I ’ are, a pair of the doctor's
of trousers? I was giv’ a pair last time I was
'ere, an’ I wore ’em fer munce.”
THE LADY: “My goodness, did you? lam the doctah!"
Oh, unless I pay on a certain day they 7 will out me
on my head.
But I battle to hold my own, though cold the man-
ners of those who wait
To take my place in the home I reared on the laud
I fenced and tilled and cleared
In days by hunger and hardship bleared, as I labored
long and late.
But winter has fled, and the days are kind and the
sunlight makes me sing.
Oh, I long to wheel in an Irish reel or shuffle a
Highland fling !
Yet toil I must; and the old spring-tooth is crying
for overhaul—
Ah, the shares and lines and the set of tines must
wa it for a future call!
I’ll strengthen the bends with odds and ends, I’ll
tighten them nut and joint;
For the scrapheap helps when a need is dire, so I’ll
brace the springs with fencing-wire
And heat the tines in the kitchen fire, and hammer
them each a point.
Then over the loam I’ll scratch once more till the
harvest days roll round,
Till the reapers earn me a. due return from a tract
of fallowed ground.
And after the greedy bills are met and a land instal-
ment paid,
I'll dash through the gates to pay my rates; but,
alas, I’m sore afraid
if the yield is lean they will pick me clean and
leave me a waster still!
Thank Heaven for one consoling grace—to know
there’s a man to fill my 7 place,
\\ ho never has earned himself disgrace by 7 harassing
Kaiser Bill.

ESSEX TOURING
The main Issue with Essex has
always been to give greatest value
for the money. Its fulfilment of
that aim was never so clear and its
sales supremacy so completely
acknowledged as to-day. With Hud-
son, it outsells every other line of
6-cylinder cars.
Economies possible only to the
largest production of 6-cylinder cars,
and exclusive patents no other
maker can share have resulted in
the best cars and lowest prices in
Essex history. Essex is built on the
Super-Six principle by Hudson work-
men in Hudson shops. No other
maker shares its advantage. In
quality Hudson and Essex are alike.
Both are easy riding and easy steer-
ing. Their unfailing reliability and
economy are known everywhere.
And their conspicuous and increas-
ing success reflects the rapidity and
completeness with which the real
facts regarding automobile values
have penetrated the entire market.

“Slam”: I think the birdmen claim too
much for the eagle-hawk. It does not build the
biggest Australian nest, and it has not the biggest
wing-spread among Australian birds. The enormous

spread, even in museums one can see albatrosses
10 and 12 feet across, and they are exclusively
southern birds. Dr. Leach gives the span as 14 ft.,
almost twice that of the eagle.

“Iveppel” : “Caesar” enters a protest against
the indiscriminate shooting of wallabies (B.
5/11/’25). If his wallaby-shooter who drove into
Linville (N.S.W.) with 1018 skins on board did the
same thing in Central Bananaland he would be con-
sidered a public benefactor. There the wallabies are
over-running farms and cattle-runs in thousands, eat-
ing the grass and doing great damage. No bonus
is paid for them at the present time, and a move is
being made in Queensland to have the dingo bonus
reduced from £1 to 15s. per scalp to enable a bonus
of 3d. to be paid for wallabies. Trappers are now
getting about 9d. each for wallaby skins, and an
added 3d. would be an inducement to trap harder.
The farmers are emphatic on the question of wallaby
destruction ; sudden death is the fate of any wallaby
they come across.
“E.S.S.”: “Moe’s”
£95 dingo scalp (B.
29/10/’25) was a good
one, but not a record.
Some years ago the
Associated Graziers
subscribed £100 for
a dog that for a long
time had infested the
Bathurst district. He
was too cunning to be
caught with baits and
traps, and too wary for
the best hunters to get
a shot at him. At last
a squatter tricked him
by treacling the brute’s
feet. He got the idea
from seeing his own
dogs licking their feet
when any sticky sub-
stance adhered to them.
The treacle was poi-
soned, and then trailed
along a sandy pad
where dingo-tracks had
been seen. The gritty
stuff stuck to warri-
gal’s toes, and in lick-
ing it off he absorbed
enough poison to kill
him. Another high-
priced outlaw was got
near Tambo by a
hunter who spent
several days studying
tracks, then set a trap
lightly covered with
mud in the water
where the dingo went
regularly to drink.
THIS FREEDOM.
WARDER: “You can go now. Your wife’s bailed you out.”
PRISONER: “No rest for the wicked!”
“N.K.C.”: One of tlie things for which
Victoria has to thank Frank Tate, Director of Edu-
cation, is his insistence on the conservation of bird-
life. October was set apart as “Bird Month,” and
birds’ habits, etc., w 7 ere studied in the schools. As
a result of this interest, it is the rarest thing to
find rifled nests in that State, and in my out-back
school we have a regular colony of miners, cat-birds,
maggies and small birds lining up regularly at
lunch-hour for their tit-bits. New to the place,
I “roared up” the kiddies for throwing their crusts
about, but a deputation of indignant youngsters
explained subsequently that they were for their
birds. Now one old maggie regards himself as the
sole owner of my crusts.

“Coppertop”: “F.1.N.” (B. 29/10/’25)
asks if white-gums 18in. in dia-
meter can be used as tank-stand
poles. Yes. Select good, sound,
straight poles and bark them;
then remove about 2in. of surface
wood and leave the props in a
shaded spot where the wind can
get at them for a couple < f
months. Give the whole * length
of the poles, including the two
ends, two coats of boiled tar and
put them in the ground, standing
the same way up as they. grew.
Make the holes big enough to have
about 3in. of sand next the pole
when the filling-in starts. It’s
the first time I have heard them
called “poles,” though. Through-
out Bananaland all timber people
call them “stumps.”
“Oobber-o’-mine”: If “F.1.N.”
takes my advice, he won’t use
white-gum poles for his tank
stand. About 10 years is as long
as the wood lasts in the ground,
though I have known some of it to
continue longer. He should try to
get any of the following: red-gum,
grey-gum, bloodwood, ironbark or
tallow-wood. Any of these tim-
bers will last fully three times as
long as white-gum.
“Gouger”: On Cape York Peninsula an
argument cropped up as to whether a white man
could “live on the bush” if abandoned to his own
resources. A hard-bitten busliman immediately
offered to provision the camp for a week on natural
bush foods, procuring all his own game and edibles,
and using only native tools, provided we stood him
as much beer as he could drink in a week on our
return to Cooktown. The four of us agreed. “Cookie”
made his “tools” in a week, and on' the following
Monday started us off with roast wild duck (snared
and cooked nigger-fashion), roast and boiled yams,
zamia-flour bread (treated nigger-fashion) and wild
honey. Tuesday we had boiled young cockatoo, yam
as a vegetable, zamia-flour bread and honey. Wed-
nesday’s menu was roast wallaby, yams and a sweet
onion growing in the swamps. For dessert our cook
produced boiled scrub-plums and a scrub fruit re-
sembling the quandong. For drink was served a
billycan of a peculiarly-flavored, sweetish liquid, the
basis of it being crushed pupae of “sweet” ants, with
a touch of “sugar-bag.” Thursday produced boiled
galah, roast duck, yams, and onions and water-lily
bulbs. Friday saw an abundance of broiled and boiled
fish, caught in traps, with the soft, whitish-green
heart of a palm-tree as an excellent substitute for
cabbage; a boiled plum as dessert, very similar in
taste to the wongai with the tart juice extracted.
There was a change of bread, the flour this time
being made from mangrove-seed. Saturday’s fare
was baked porcupine, yams, bread and honey ; and on
Sunday we had boiled crabs (the monster green
mangrove variety), oysters, mussels, and bread and
honey. 'We had never realised that such a variety
of foods grew in the tropical scrubs. Experience plus
the week’s beer-money taught us a lesson.

“Parama”: “W.P.T.’s” species of fig-tree
that induces drowsiness, followed by violent headache
(B. 29/10/’25), has a cousin in New Guinea. It
grows about 30ft. high, with low, wide-spreading
branches and thick, pale-green foliage. The blossoms
are very numerous, small, and of a mustard yellow,
with a scent that is sickly-sweet and overpoweringly
strong. I did not stay long enough under its
rather welcome shade to become drowsy, but the
splitting headache I got, the cause of which was
explained by one of my “boys” to be some particular
devil or spirit of a “too much strong bad feller,” has
made’ me shy of that variety of shade-tree ever since.
There is a somewhat similar tree in and around Cape
York, but much smaller, and weaker in its effects.
* * * *
“Oakabella”: Outbackers, says “1.L.1.”
(B. ]9/11/’25), hunt the wild mountain pigs of N.Q.,
descendants of animals liberated by Captain Cook,
“for meat.” I wish he’d told us how they cook them.'
There are wild pigs in more than one coastal district
of W.A. whose forebears cast over farmyard shackles
probably less than half a century ago, but their
flesh is about the toughest and rankest thing imagin-
able. I remember the camp cook of a surveying party
who once strove desperately for days to convert the
carcase of one of these animals into something re-
motely resembling edible pork and failed absolutely.
Are the wild pigs of Queensland less muscular, or the
cooks more skilful?
“Moe”: “Kuna’,s” .story of the spectral
Maori canoe seen on Lake Tarawera the night before
the eruption (B. 22/10/’25) emphasises the curious
fact that in nearly every legend of a ghost-ship in
the Pacific the rowers have dogs’ heads. This
feature is found in stories coming from points as
far apart as New Guinea and Hawaii. Probably the
dog’s head is a local modification of the jackal’s
head of Egyptian legend, which also has its tales
of spectral rowers so equipped. There are many
things in the Pacific which point to a connection of
some sort with the ancient Egypt of far-off ages,
and this is one that crops up most persistently.
* * * *
“Morob”: “Warooka” is obviously not
speaking from personal knowledge when he says that
spears and arrows are not envenomed in the Islands
by thrusting them into the corpses of human beings
and animals (B. 5/11/’25). I can recall at least
half a dozen occasions upon which I have seen it
done in New Guinea and the Solomons. In the
country around the mouth of the Markham River,
on the north-eastern coast of New Guinea, I once
came across a small platform raised about 2ft. above
the ground and covered over with a kind of bark
roof. On it lay a corpse. From obvious indications
it had been there for more than a week. It fairly
bristled with spears and spear-heads thrust into it,
and I was told that they would be left there for
some days more, after which they would be ready
for use. In some parts of Malaita, in the Solomons,
the custom is to use the body of a deceased chief
for this purpose. The slightest scratch with a spear
or arrow so treated is apt to cause death, and there
have been cases in which persons have died in agony
from the effects of poisoning by a weapon treated
several years before. Should death be escaped, a
large and hideously suppurating ulcer is sure to
form, and will take a long time to heal. The
method of infecting spears with tetanus bacilli by
putting them in the ground, point-foremost, and
leaving them there for some days is one used in
only a few places, and weapons so poisoned are never
regarded as having the same potency as those which
have been infected in corpses.
* * * *
“Hi Makai”: “Canar” (P>. 29/10/’25)
says it is impossible to explore certain lofty parts
of New Guinea on account of the diminishing atmo-
spheric pressure preventing the preparation of food.
It is a well-known fact in physics that the boiling-
point of liquids may be raised or lowered by in-
creasing or decreasing the pressure on the surface
of the liquids. Contrary to “Canar’s” contention,
it is a very simple matter to raise the boiling-point
of water to lOOdeg. C. or more. The water can
itself be made to supply any deficiency in pressure
by confining the steam until its pressure on the
surface of the water is equal to the desired atmo-
spheric pressure, and the boiling-point will then
be found to be normal. Such boilers or “digesters”
may be found in the Alps in Europe. They are
simple, closed boilers with a steam-vent controlled
by a valve working at the usual pressure of about
1511 b, to the square inch. The valve is closed by
a spring or simple counter-weight.
“Carysfort”: The mountain travellers mentioned
by “Canar” were poor scientists. The boiling-point
of water drops with the barometric pressure at
high altitudes until it fails to reach the tempera-
ture necessary to extract the thein and flavoring-
matter of tea, to coagulate the albumen of meat
or eggs, or to burst the starch granules of vege-
table foods; in other words, cooking fails with
fresh water in an open vessel. But food can be
cooked in oil or fat at any mountain height, as
their boiling-point is much higher than that of
water. Adding any soluble salt to the water also
raises the boiling-point, and food can be cooked
in brine at any practicable height. This, incidentally,
explains why potatoes, parsnips, etc., are better
cooked in sea-water, even at sea-level. The making
of tea presents difficulties, and here another method
of raising the boiling-point can be used. The pres-
sure within the saucepan or billy can be raised
by the use of a tightly-fitting lid with a weight on
top, but not too heavy, otherwise the billy may
become an explosive bomb.
* * « *
“Serintan”: Can any Abo. enlighten me as
to the derivation of the word “cockatoo” ? The
same bird in the Federal Malay States is named
kakaktua. Until recently I believed the Malay
word had been taken from the English, but an old
Hadji and scholar has just assured me that “kaka-
ktua” has been used by Malays for at least 100
#ears and was originally derived from the Sanskrit.
Similarly the fish here corresponding to the Aus-
tralian parrot-fish is named “ikan kakaktua.” If my
old Malay friend is right, and if “cockatoo” is an
abo. word, whence comes the connection between
Sanskrit and abo. ?

“T. Hurst”: Once when adrift in the
Pacific on a small steamer, the engines of which
periodically broke down, I caught a shark about 12ft.
long. The donkeyman, who opened up the shark
with the intention of making a walking-stick for
himself out of the backbone, cut the heart out and

threw it on deck. This occurred about 10 in the
morning'. Seven or eight hours later I was Sur-
prised to notice that the organ was still throbbing.
I related this incident to Dr. Trubv King, who told
me that, when a student in Scotland, he, with some
others, bought a skate at the fish-market. Some
hours later they proceeded to dissect it. After
removing the head and sundry other parts, they
found the heart was still beating.
MANLY LAGOON.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The pines were sighing in the wind
And nodding each to each,
The sea in changeless grandeur rolled
Upon a changeless beach.
Due north I wandered on and on,
To spend the golden noon
With bee and butterfly and bird
Beside a lit lagoon.
A lit lagoon, a lit lagoon,
That Nature ceaselessly
At work through years and countless years,
Made beautiful to see!
She made it beautiful to see;
And, maybe, as she wrought
With wind and tide, of artist-folk
And beauty-lovers thought.
Howe’er this be, through year and year
She wrought with faultless hand —-
Made little capes and gleaming shoals
And banks of golden sand.
And there she sent her homing gulls,
Wide-winged and white as foam;
And there among the shore-side reeds
The reed-bird had its home.
With music too, bird-music too.
She made her work complete;
For there the butcher-bird sang loud,
And there the thrush sang sweet.
Thus yesterday, with joy at heart,
I left the haunts of men,
To look upon that lit lagoon,
And walk by it again.
At last I came upon its shores
Beneath the noonday sun—
But oh, the spoilers had been there,
And grievous work they'd done!
Though changelessly the near-by sea
Its breakers shoreward poured,
All gone was Beauty from that shrine
Where Beauty dwelt adored.
Within that lit and still lagoon,
Shored round by green and gold.
The stars no more shall view themselves,
The moon her round behold.
Gone is the reed-bird with his song,
And gone the reeds wherein
At turn of tide, ’neath sun and moon,
Flashed silver-tail and fin.
Broad shallows, where waves rippling ran,
And blue cranes came to doze,
No more rich sunsets, ere they fade,
Shall tint with pearl and rose.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
Kind-hearted Sir Walter Davidson, whom
we knew for years as Governor of this State,
held levee at South Head on a sun-gilded
afternoon of last week. Here while the wind
off the Pacific blew quick and salt through
that little City of the Still, above the earth-
cover of the scholarly old brain, the great
of Church and State gathered, and Sir Dud-
ley de Chair unveiled the stern beauty of the
Celtic Cross which is the State’s monument
to Sir AValter. How far from home ho lies,
this earth-wanderer who was born in County
Down, in Ireland, and afterwards represented
his King in such outposts as the Seychelles
and Newfoundland ! When Church and State
had heaped their laudations with the fresh
wreaths above his grave, Archbishop and
Governor, choir boy and Red Grosser left
him in the gathering dusk guarded by the
Celtic cross. Strangely enough it was while
on his way to see how the work w T as pro-
gressing that Mr. Day, the architect of the
cross, met his own death in a motor acci-
dent.
The TJ.S.A. Thanksgiving turkey had his
wishbone picked clean at the Wentworth on
the date set down in the calendar for the
solemn rite. Accompanying him on his sacri-
ficial journey were the cranberry sauce, the
plum-pudding and the pumpkin-pie to which
the Pilgrim Fathers treated themselves at
the historic meal that commemorated their
first real crop. And there were things at
the Wentworth that the hardy pioneers hadn’t
dreamed of —balloons and lanterns, confetti
and squeakers, and dresses such as no Pil-
grim Mother would have dared to appear in.
The A. C. Berks brought a big party, in which
were their daughter, Mrs. Victor Audette,
the surgeon Dan Kellys, the Mortimer Rich-
ards couple. Prince Edward’s organist Will
Prior and his wife, and Dorothy Coffee. The
generous Donald Bourke pair were other not-
ables on the crowded floor, and Edna Thomas
and June Elvidge were among the hundreds
linked together by the bond of splendid rai-
ment and anti-vegetarian diet.
In the “little girl” wedding-dress of the
moment pretty Janet Harvey looked as
though she were playing at getting married
when she floated up St. Mark’s aisle the
other afternoon on her father's arm. Janet,
who is the second daughter of the Justice
Harvey couple, allied an old lace veil to
ivory satin for the occasion, and dressed
her unoccupied arm with a sheaf of pink
roses and orchids. James Francis Litch-
field. of Cooma, was the young man waiting
at the altar-rails while the passage of the
lily-decked aisle was negotiated in the best
manner by the bride and her three maids.
These were sister Mary, Moira Brady and
Mollie Street, and their almond-green geor-
gette frocks wore three flounces and were
topped by green hats; their* flowers —gladioli
glowing and gorgeous—looked like cupped
jewels in the afternoon sun. Will Litch-
field best-manned, and Darcy Hixson and
Norman Reading stood by in the interests of
the ’groom. Hillingdon, the Harvey home at
Darling Point, was the h.q. of the party
that followed ; hither, best wishes in hand,
came the Chief Justice of Australia and his
lady, the chief-engineer of the State’s
judicial machine and Mrs. Street, and a long
line of Justices and Judges with their ladies.
The bride’s mother was in sable georgettes
against which a posy of roses glowed ruby-
red.
Evelyn Brunton, of Gladswood, who by
the time this reaches the eye has been made
Mrs. Eric Lawson at St. James’s, spent a
busy week behind the festive food thrust be-
fore her by legions of friends. An afternoon
Pekoe and piano alliance in her honor, host-
essed by Mrs. Charles Marsden, who is a
kind of aunt by marriage, caused quite a
social ripple. Mrs. Charlie Waldron, from
America (she’s a niece of Mrs. Spencer Brun-
ton’s), and Mrs. Moreing came in for a flood
of limelight, and a ray or two flashed on to
Mrs. A. E. Hughes in just-return cd-from-
Europe clothes. Daughter of the house
Nancy Marsden sang with sweetness to Mar-
garet Chalmers’s accompaniments.
St. Philip’s wore a wreath of roses in its
hair when Kathleen Patten became Mrs.
Harold Wilson under its high dome, with
Canon Cakebread as referee. Brother-in-law
Norman McGregor shepherded the young
bride to the altar; and her swatliings of
ivory Romaine weighted with crystal em-
broideries and misted over with an old Brus-
sels veil were under the surveillance of four
maids in delphinium blues and petal pinks
with silver encrustments. Bride’s mother
hostessed the reception at the Waratah.
Victoria Barracks wishes Major Frank
Berryman, of the Staff Corps, who landed
home with a D.S.O. from the war, all the luck
and happiness a charming bride can bring
him. She is Muriel Whipp, eldest daughter
of the J. H. Whipps, of Burwood, and kept
her tryst in old St. Stephen’s last Saturday
evening in sheen of silver and lace, with a
gleam of pink satin peeping through the gos-
samer. Bridesmaid Violet Whipp, a young
sister of the bride, was in a foam of white
georgette agleam with bead embroidery.
Major Lee attended to the serious business of
No. 2 man. After the knot was tied the cake
was cut at the Australia. The hero of the
occasion is a son of VV. L. Berryman, of
Box Hill (Vie.).
Sydney Uni. is seething under its mortar-
board over the academic engagement of the
week. The girl in the case is Janet Carter,
and her ring-provider is lan Clunies Ross.
Janet in her year plucked the Wentworth
prize, and in spite of it was so popular that
she was elected president of the Women’s
Union. Her father is the pastor of the
Catholic Apostolic Church in Sydney; artist
Norman Carter is an uncle, and Bryce and
Mowat Carter, the musicians, are other
gifted relations. lan, who held the Eliza
and Walter Hall scholarship, is a veterinary
surgeon and part-time lecturer at the Uni.:
hq has a nice gift of story-writing, too, but
is over-modest about it. His father was
lecturer in chemistry at Sydney Tech.; his
mother is one of the most popular members
of the Women’s Club.
Another engagement is that of Barbara
Bowker, youngest daughter of the Steer
Bowkers, to Alan Potter, an Englishman.
The wedding is dated for early in the
New Year.
Enid Muggridge's marriage to her nice,
brown Queenslander, Norman Moffat, is to
take place early in the year; mother, having
seen her only child in good hands, will then
pay another visit to Norway, her childhood’s
home. Enid’s fianeg of other days was killed
in Palestine; Norman is his brother.
Once the mercury gets up in the world, the
practical-minded philanthropist stretches for
a shady hat and a group of helpers, and lo!
the fete is loose in the land. With few
exceptions, they offer no variety, but cling
with an optimism that is invariably justified
to the stall piled with faneywork. flowers,
home-made cakes and those odds and ends
that fill the nooks and corners of every
woman’s home and supply her with 101
arguments in favor of a vacuum clean.
Last Saturday six fetes of full dimensions
girdled Sydney from Bondi to Cremorne;
and of lesser there were no doubt as
many as there are suburbs. Miss Preston
Stanley did the honors at Scarba, the Welfare
Home for Children at Bondi; and here, be-
neath the Moreton Bays, Joan Rayner and
her Green-leafers filled the night with the
mellifluous innocuousness of the pastoral
brand of drama.
The head of the House of Fairfax has
passed away in her 9ist year. Daughter of
John Armstrong and widow of that knight
James Fairfax who was a son of the founder
of the S. M. Herald, she spent her last years at
Bellevue Hill
—once better
known ae Fair-
fax’s H i 11—
living much in
retirement
since the death
of her husband
in 1919. Dur-
ing the war
her labors for
the Red Cross
were unremit-
ting ; but pro-
bably her
widest sphere
of influence
was the
Y.W.C.A., of
which she
was president.
The Queen’s
Jubilee Fund
wa s another
charge which
she helped to
administer; for 25 years she presided over
its committee. The City Mission, the Queen
Victoria Homes, various kindergartens, the
District Nursing Association and the Child-
ren’s Hospital were others on the list of her
multitudinous good works. She is mourned
by one daughter, Miss Fairfax, and five
sons. The portrait is from Freeman’s studio.
The two big cabarets of the week were run in
the interests of the fete for St. Martha’s Home
at Leichhardt which takes place on Satur-
day. Each was captained and manned by its
own group of helpers, and each was out after
stock-in-trade. The crew of the rose stall
filled the Ambassadors early in the week,
while the Wentworth made an antbed look
like the Deserted Village wdien the Matinee
Ball revellers descended in a flutter of chiffons
and butterfly millinery on the Church Hill
caravanserai. Among the grown-ups were
chattering little girl cockatoos and canaries.
They were under the wing of Mrs. Withers
and danced amiably enough with the just-
beginning jockeys and fairies and Spanish
dancers who occurred here and there on the
horizon. The president of the committee,
Mrs. S. A. Burns, had in her party the organ-
iser, Mrs. Morgan O’Neill. Mrs. Greaves
and Mrs. H. J. Daly were the secretaries.
Nobody needs to be told of the wonders
in leather, raffia, brass and pottery worked
by the disabled soldiers. All these will be on
sale at Rose Hall in Darlinghurst to-morrow
(Friday). A 7 egetables and other things needful
for the housewife’s weekly campaign will
also be on sale. Business starts at 10 and
goes the round of the clock.
Louis Nettemcnt, Consul-General for
France, destroyed the impression that he was
a confirmed
bachelor last
Saturday
morning. He
was q xi i e 11 y
married at St.
P a trick’s,
Church Hill,
to Suza n n e
Herchnelz,
who had just
returned from
France with
her parents by
the Ormonde.
The bride, a
petite, pretty
brunette, is
just about 21,
and the only
child of Alfred
Her e h u e 1 z,

wool, - buying-
very profitable. Papa, mamma and the
newly-weds just trotted up to the Hotel Aus-
tralia after the ceremony and had lunch
together as if nothing so important as a
xvedding had taken place—no attendants, no
wedding frippery, not even a eqke. The
Consul-General afterwards removed his bag-
gage from his bachelor diggings at the Union
Club, and is now domiciled with his charm-
ing little bride at Hampton Court. M. and
Mme. will spend a few days motoring on
the Mountains in the car which the C-.G.
imported for the great event. May Moore
made this picture of the bridegroom.
The vice-regals having withdrawn behind
the veil of Court mourning, it devolved upon
Tom Henley’s lady to open the exhibition
of the Women Handicrafters in the Educa-
tion Gallery. This she did in a neat little
speech from behind, a bank of crimson gera-
niums that breathed out their wistful sweet-
ness along the platform’s rim, and inciden-
tally drew attention to the fact that about
the only line of home furnishings that has so
far escaped the designing crafter is the win-
dow-box. Everything else seems to have at-
tracted the facile fingers even to an
ornamental gag for the window that will
rattle; it occurs as a rose, a waratah or (for
the mascot-fiend) a black cat. Marvellous
bridge and writing accessories in sealing-wax
blink seductively and with all the air of
lacquer. The new wood-modelling from the
deft and artistic fingers of Mrs. Rosenthal,
of Darling Point, in spite of the Moorish
sound of its name—Barbola —has '‘•he effect
of porcelain; in this show, at any rate, it is
mostly expressed in the outlines of Austra-
lian bush-flowers. Among the raffia-work
attractive little hats, wreathed with self-
flowers, caught the fancy; and a pile of
cushions, downy and exotic, suggested a
sultan’s couch. But it is the beauty of the
stitchery that makes the irresistible appeal:
baby-garments, infinitesimal fragments of
muslin and lace, silk and embroideries; and
trousseaus and guest-towels and supper-
cloths —one tapestried in blue with the wil-
low legend—that make a betrothal ring seem
a positive necessity. There is such a range
of engaging trifles that the problem of the
Christmas gift is solved on the spot.
Stewart Dawson has lent the Ambassadors
to surgeon Maitland’s widow and Mrs. J. A.
Wilson for their Christmas party on Decem-
ber IS. It will be at the unusual hour of
10 o’ the morn, and the guests will be 1200
kiddies “not likely to be invited to similar
functions.” Toys, of course, are needed to
make the gathering a worth-while Christmas
party, and Mr. Adams, of the Commonwealth
Bank, will corral the wildest rocking-horse
you care to send. Rupert Markham has been
again cast for the part of Santa Claus.
For the last time this year the Fledglings
frivolled at the Palais in the interests of the
Kindergarten Union. The young things who
run these dances have contrived to make
them both profitable and popular, and the
affair the other night kept to the general
rule. In fact, it may be said to have out-
shone any previous effort. To it came girls
flashing crystal and diamente, and boys flasli-
ing teeth fit to advertise a new line of
dentifrice. Came treasurers Olga Ivocli and
Esme Rodd, the former in a very French
combination of ivory and silver; and Grace
Jewell, one of the secretaries, wore the same
color-scheme in a Period frock of moires and
lace. Thelma Greer, in jacaranda-hued
georgettes, was squired by her Ulysses,
George Clark, just returned from the wilds
of Europe. A group of Gladys Talma’s
pupils did their graceful Peace Ballet, and
Rose Hardy Johnstone and Margaret Arthur,
who have shared the organising work, must
be accorded a cheer before the final fade-out.
Soprano Gwladys Edwards, from Perth,
will give her first Sydney recital in the
King’s Hall on the 11th. Gwladys has the
distinction of being one of the few Marchesi-
trained songbirds in our midst. With her
will be associated organist Lilian Frost and
brilliant young violinist Rene Rich.
Two hundred and fifty boys and girls
were the guests of the Salvation Army camp
at Collaroy last summer, and only those
kiddies from the oven-like atmosphere of
our arid back-streets can fell just what
those 14 days meant to them. This
year Commissioner Whatmore wants to in-
crease the number of visitors to .‘lOO, and,
besides, he has on his list 500 families to
whom his forces intend to send a Christmas
hamper, and 250 old people who are to have
a special Christmas dinner at the Army’s
expense. Cheques will find him at 09 Goul-
burn-street, City.
“The Moth of Moonbi” captured the im-
agination of a typical first-morning audience
at the Prince Edward last week. The screen-
play is built on Queensland-writer Mabel
Forrest’s novel, “The Wild Moth,” and it
tells a good yarn of Queensland station life.
There are romance and cattle-duffing, a
manly jackeroo and a pretty little heroine
all tangled up in a plot worked out among
the finest scenery of the richly-endowed
northern State. The photography is a
miracle of perfection and quite an emu-plume
in the cap of the Australian Film Produc-
tions people w T lio made the picture. The folks
in it, too, have the look of real Australians,
and the audience took the risk of seeming
ridiculous and liked that feature.
Miss Brisbane writes :
Grandmamma’s lumber-room was ransacked for
the first, play of the four staged last week by the
Repertory Society—the ancient antimacassar, the wax
fruits under glass, the white-lace curtain and
the expansive skirt were all features of “Followers.”
Barbara Sisley, in grey, took the principal part,
and Beres Corrio made a charming early-Victorian
maiden. The atmosphere of the rather slight playlet
was well reproduced. The best production was Barrie’s
“Barbara’s Wedding Day,” in which Jean Trundle,
Rhoda Felgate and George Eaton scored, and Leon
Guvatt did very well as the gardener who weds the
daughter of the house. Grizel Gibson starred in
“Everybody’s Husband,” in which Elizabeth Carew
Smyth and Mrs P. J. Symes played parts. Little
Una Biek was remarkably good in the fourth little
offering, “Thirty Minutes in a Street.” Irma Dear-
den played the maid in “Followers” with vivacity.
The Shire Hall, St. George, was decked out as a
chapel for the wedding of Beryl Kemp, of Moolaba,
St. George. The bride, in cloth of silver, with a
Brussels veil, was given away by her brother, H.
Kemp, and Nancy McGowan (Brisbane) and Con-
stance Carson (Bowral) ’maided in flame-color.
Guests 200 strong motored out to Moolabah,
where the widowed mother of the bride had
spread the feast. The ’moon rises in Sydney.
Wattle Leaguers mourn the death of Mrs. F. Papi.
She once raised £2OOO by a fair she arranged for
the Children’s Hospital, and did a lot for soldiers
at the time of the S’African War.
The Central Tech, has had a show of work by
women students —chiefly dressmaking, millinery and
cooking. Mrs. Young received the Wilsons, who
opened the display. And of course there was after-
noon tea.
Over the new claims by the theatrical trades
union Barrington Waters gave evidence that “The
O’Brien Girl” (one of the big hits of the South) lost
the Firm £l5OO in three weeks at His Majesty’s,
Brisbane. Davidson (of J.C.W.) declared that bring-
ing companies to Bananaland is not very profitable,
largely because of the Northern habit of spending
summer nights out of doors.
Mayor Jolly gave a reception to the British
bowlers, and afterwards took them to One Tree Hill.
The Lieut.-Governor and Mrs. Lennon were in the
party. Toowong bowlers entertained them in the
afternoon, the T. B. Wightmans acting as hosts.
Booroodabin also feted the Britishers in a pavilion
decorated with red, white and blue, Mrs. A. Ward
receiving in black mariette.
Professor Stable seemed pleased with the result
of the Shakspearean Society’s year when he spoke
about it in the Women’s Club. Thanks were voiced
to Mrs. Hancock and Douglas Graham. “Romeo
and Juliet” (produced by A. G. Stark) is to be
played in May.
Mrs. Jim McWhirter, who died suddenly last week
of a heart attack, leaves many friends in all the
capitals. She had done much for charitable move-
ments in Brisbane.
St. John’s, Bulimba, saw the marriage of “Bonty”
Dickson (Acting-Judge Dickson’s youngest) and
Minnie Kay. The bride, in ivory, was given away
by her father; Elsie Frost and Nina Binkin ’maided
in eau-de-nil, and little Joyce Dickson and Gladys
Markwell were fairies in pink-petal frocks. The
Wintergarden Cafe saw the feasting, and the newly-
weds left in the Dickson launch to greet the islands
of the bay.

The death of the Beautiful Queen cancelled
many functions last week, among them the
Mayor’s annual banquet, arranged for Thurs-
day night. Councillor Brunton had planned
to feast the mere men at the Exhibition
while his lady entertained their wives and
womenfolk at dinner at the Oriental, with
a theatre-party to follow. The rejoicings
are. of course, merely postponed.
The curtain-raisers of the inter-State
tennis tournament began on Friday. Maids
and men from the sister States with but a
single goal, the Davis Cup, are daily knock-
ing balls over the courts at the Albert ground
m company with our own champions. The
maids have frocks of white, popularly silk,
mostly sleeveless and one-piece, comfortable
and cool, with millinery white and close-
fitting. The opening day saw beautiful
weather and careful play; but on Saturday
the temperature climbed over the ninety,
with a torrid wind, and there was a sort
of “don’t care who goes for the Cup” about
many strokes. Patrons sat upon unsheltered
seats and burnt; parasols, though they made
a brilliant showing, were powerless to pro-
tect their owners; and small boys passed
amid players and spectators bearing iced
water and lemon-squashes. Among the on-
lookers pretty striped silks, colored linens,
voiles and georgettes were worn with droop
hats ribbon-trimmed; and gay apache hand-
kerchiefs made their appearance as a pro-
tection for low necks. Mrs. Titt Rivers, in
black satin stripes and crin. millinery,
feather-wreathed, and Lady Helena Rous, in
pleated cream cliarmeuse embroidered in
black, with a picture hat, were among the
enthusiasts. Mrs. Norman Brookes, whose
husband is this year’s president of the
L.T.A.V., looked on in biscuit georgette
topped by rose-decked leghorn; Mrs, Gerald
Patterson had a shady brown hat atop of
a pink linen frock.
The end-of-the-year rush of students’ con-
certs is with us, and so early as last week
a big scholastic institution even had its
annual Speech Day. Hilda Roberts, of the
Uni. Conservatorium staff, submitted a
creditable pianoforte students’ programme
on an afternoon. Only one boy put up a
fight of tone and technique against a bevy
of daintily white-clad girls. One of the
young players was Judy Amadio, who in-
herits some of her flautist dad’s talents. Note-
worthy was the brilliant performance of
Margot Macgibbon, a flapper with rare gifts
at both piano and violin. At the recent
R.A.M. examinations the visiting judges took
much notice of this young Australian. To-
night the pupils can sit in judgment on their
teacher, who is billed to present Bach.
Beethoven, Frank Bridge and other works
at the Assembly Hall.
Dr. Sol has been added to the staff of the
Convalescent Home of the Children’s Ilospi
tal at Hampton. He works in a new helio-
therapy ward, opened last week by Mayor
Brunton. who did the speech-making in place
of Lady Stradbroke, absent through Court
mourning. Youthful patients under treat-
ment for joint and bone diseases get special
tuition from a teacher appointed by the
Department of Public Instruction, and so
the days are passed usefully and the long
wait is made to seem shorter. The com-
mittee has dreams of making the new doctor
work overtime, not only for children but for
the more matured. And when that dream
comes true the education will be extended
to vocational training. Very practical people
are the governors of this hospital.
The Conservatorium ladies’ choir, in white
wrappings, raised finely-balanced voices,
melodious and uniformly on the note, at the
Assembly Hall on Saturday night. The
chief offering was a first performance of
Fritz Hart's new choral work, “O Gloriosa
Domina,” with a repetition of his “Salve
Caput,” and sundry unaccompanied part-
songs. Constance Burt wore a silver frock
for her Mozart aria, to which Margot Mac-
gibbon, in white georgette, played a polished
violin obligato. Gertrude Ilealy raised her
fiddle over a gown of figured wood-brown
velvet, and Victoria Anderson was a sil-
houette of ivory crepe de Chine, silver-
fringed—she sang her folk-songs less well.
In the audience was Mrs. Maurice Kauff-
man. whose “Isle of Innisfree” had a first
performance by; the combined songsters.
The Orpheus Club Choir is another
women’s society, first heard last week at the
Queen’s Hail. The choristers forsook the
usual concert apparel of white, wearing leaf-
green silk tuniced over white. Their con-
ductor, Mrs. Ella Kingston, was in harmony,
with a green gown appearing beneath a long
coat of dull gold-brocaded tissue. Solo pian-
ist Winifred Lloyd followed the lead in
white prinked up with the verdant hue.
From London about a young man who has
just arrived in Australia: —
With an ancestry that includes Robin Hood and
the ex-Victorian Sir Samuel Wilson, it was on the
cards that young Lord Hastings would do something-
unusual ; and he did. His marriage to Christina
Casati, daughter of the Marquis Casati, was a
genuine surprise for his parents, who had planned a
bachelor visit to Australia for their heir. The
bride and bridegroom should be very popular in
Australia. They are both good-looking and keen
dancers. The young viscountess lias a London repu-
tation for originality, and is said to have kept a
snake in the bathroom of her little house at Chelsea.
Her mother, equally ready to challenge convention,
lately attended a fancy-dress ball on the Continent
with her train borne by eight gilded dwarfs.
The titled Hastings houeymooners gave
the cold shoulder to interviewers on their
arrival by the Ormonde. The Viscount and
bis Viscountess may settle in these parts ;
be is going first to the broad acres owned
here by bis mother, a daughter of the late
“Salmon” Wilson, long-time a Victorian
M.P.. of Ercildoune, who made a tidy for-
tune in Australia.
Wedding bells rang at Melbourne Gram-
mar Chapel on Thursday night for Doris
Hall and Rolfe Warren McKellar; the after-
party was at the Lyceum Club. The bride,
whose father, P. St. John Hall, is a leading
light in the law. did law 7 herself at the Uni.
Her raiment was ivory georgette worked in
gold thread, the train lined with gold satin ;
her tulle veil depended from a coronet of
lace. Charmingly in the picture were the
two bridesmaids, Mary Turnbull and Mary
Bayne, in primrose georgette and gold lace,
with coiffures swathed in sweet-pea tones.
Mrs. Hall’s gown of delphinium-blue figured
marocain was in harmony with black mil-
linery and a posy of red blossoms.
The nuptials of Dorothy Fox and journalist
Norman McCance were celebrated at Mel-
bourne Grammar Chapel. The bride, a
daughter of the Joel Foxes, of East Mal-
vern, acquired her new name in white geor-
gette with silver embroidery, set oft' with a
posy of water-lilies 411 d a tulle veil. The
leads had no support. Dinner and dance
followed at No. 0 Darling-street, where the
bride’s mother’s gown of reseda tone was a
nice background for a bouquet of crimson
roses.
Prior to sailing by the Naldera for a
two-years’ course in wireless in the Big
Smoke, Flight-officer T. A. Swinburne had
a matrimonial engagement with Gweneth
Evans, of Brighton, who wore powder-blue
and white georgette with a small velvet-
ribboned hat in lieu of the usual trained
raiment and veil. Ethel Harrison (Sydney)
and Beryl Strangward were in the offing.
The Point Cook Fliers had a day out, pro-
viding air stunts and escort for the happy
couple to .sea.
The maiden in the sports attire is Nest

in slighter degree. Nearly 300 of them were
children ranging in age from 3A to 15
years. 1 Miss Malcolm’s picture was made
by Dickinson-Monteath.
Joyce Ilerschell, who became Mrs. Ernest
Turnbull on Thursday night at Christ
Church, South Yarra, struck a new note in
wedding finery with a paie-pink tulle veil
over her sheath frock of ivory crepe do Chine
and silver-tissue train. The three attendant
maids, who received gold chain-hags for their
services, dangled crystal fringe upon white
georgette; their head-ornaments were folded
toques of mauve velvet and cloth of silver.
The bride's parents gave a dinner-dance at
No. 9 Darling-street afterwards.
Mahalah Fordham, M.Sc., a good-looking
maiden who does Liverpool University the
honor of being its lecturer in zoology, spent
a few days here last week on her way to
Sydney. The visitor came south to study
Westralia’s wild-animal life, and has made
Perth Uni. her headquarters for the past
four months. She is returning by the Mon-
golia, taking a collection of ‘‘dissections
with her.
Rita Miller packed her bag last week,
and by this has set out on the quest for
fame, Milan and grand opera being her
objectives. The soprano, slim, bright-eyed
and intelligent, raised her flexible notes in
Melba’s recent grand-opera company on a
few occasions, and such encouragement has
spurred her to bigger things. President Mrs.
H. J. Robertson and some of the Women’s
Automobile Club gave the songbird a fare-
well cup of tea and many pretty gifts at
Menzies’ on Friday afternoon.
This is a little picture of artist Fred Me-
Cubbin’s widow, who with Mrs. A’. E. Ilen-
d erso n has
launched the
Cafe Julian in
the old Flin-
ders - street
home of the
short - lived
Evening Sun.
She is the
chef of the
venture. Pic-
tures by lead-
ing Victorian
artists deco-
rate the walls
of the rendez
vous, and they
are a meal in
thcms elves,
tho ug h the.
chef will be
disappointed if
patrons don't
want more.
Of her family of four sous and two daugh-
ters, Louis, who was for a time stretcher-
bearer in the Great War, is now attached to
the War Museum ; he was a fellow-worker
with the late Web Gilbert. Daughter Sheila
also follows the thorny path of art. The
air around the Julian will therefore be
Bohemian, yet not too Bohemian, and there
will be art for lunch and high tea, with the
usual side-lines morning and afternoon.
Sheila McNeill, of the Carnegie State-
school staff, has been selected from 100 ap-
plicants for the job of welfare officer for
her department. It will be her business to
travel around the State and see that decent
accommodation is provided for teachers,
especially of her own sex. Yeai’s ago Mrs.
Jack Woods, widow of one of Graham Berry's
henchmen, did similar missionary work, but
when she retired the position was cut out.
St. Catherine’s, of Toorak, which is near
the social high-water mark among the schools
of this city, had its ex-students’ annual re-
union last week. Headmistress Miss Temple-
ton, her black lace millinery worn above
a delphinium-blue frock, did the honors, with
the help of Mrs, J. R. Mactier, the retiring
president. Vivacious Sheila Buchan, treas-
urer and secretary, who ran the rally, topped
a ehampagne-hued crepe de Chine and black
satin coat with a crin. hat decked with gold
lace. The newly-elected president is Joan
Trenchard; she had a black gown touched
with brown. St. Catherine’s old girls are
not mere flatterers, for the free kindergar-
tens and baby health centres benefit by their
efforts.
Mrs. Charles E. Dennis wore painted ivory
chiffon draperies and a black crin. hat for
her at-home at the Alexandra Club. The
floral decorations were exquisite, especially
the rhododendrons. Miss Creswick and Bar-
bara Hamilton, back from overseas wander-
ings, were the chief reasons for the crumbs
that fell upon the Persian carpets.
Mrs. John Ilifife, a vice-president of • the
Austral Salon, directed the tea-drinking and
music of an afternoon rally, at which wel-
coming smiles were bestowed upon a quin-
tette of returned traveller-members, and
sayonara was said to Mrs. Rinunington and
daughter May, who are off to England, and
to the hostess and her niece. Mrs. A. Harford,
who are bound for the Apple Isle. Salonites
present included the Weedon dame, whose
black gown and hat had dashes of Oriental
hues; Mrs. W. B. Adamson, Mrs. John
Booth, Mrs. F. B. Suhr and Mrs. J. J.
Brenan. Walter Kirby, Kathleen Rochfort
and Jessie Batchelor were of the afternoon’s
bewitching songbirds.
Dr. R. Marshall Allan, who has in his
few years gathered- distinctions in the medi-
cal and scientific world and an M.C. in
the Great Scrap, comes from Bananaland to
do research in obstetrics at the Uni. The
Women’s Hospital medical staff offered him
greeting at Menzies’ one afternoon last week,
Mrs. James Alston doing the honors. The
hostess, who is president during the holiday-
ing of Mrs. A. V. Hiskens, was in gold-
embroidered georgette, with a flower-decked
picture-hat, lilac-hued. The profession was
to the fore; and Matron Capner was also
there.
Women Automobile ('lnbites boiled the
billy to welcome back vice-president Mrs.
Felix Lloyd and Mrs. Ernest Pearce. Mrs.
Kroef and Mrs. Howard Jolley added song
to the cup.
Renee Kelly, the English star, came off
the Narkunda with an anklet of small pearls
worn under a diaphanous silk stocking. But
really you don’t want to look at her ankle:
it’s her wonderful shingled hair that catches
the eye and holds it —the richest red-gold
shingle that has sparkled in Australian sun-
light for many a summer. She brings a
husband, by the way, to help us admire it.
The annual meeting of the University Old
Students’ Association had other interests be-
sides the purely official. Members gathered
in their friends, and Clarice Malyon, A. C.
Barkleman and O. F. Sobell introduced them
to several delightful songs composed by the
late D. J. Coutts, founder and first president
of the O.S.A. As a memorial some of these
have been published lately.
The pretty little home of sculptors Douglas
Richardson and his w r ife, professionally Mar-
garet Baskerville, held a party on Thursday
night, the guests being chiefly drawn from
the Women’s Art Club and the Yic. Artists - '
Society. The host, the lately-elected president
of the Y.A.S., gave a chatty discourse upon
Australian landscape on canvas, and there
were songs at the piano by Esther Paterson
and classical warblings by Mrs. Burroughs
and Mrs. Gladys Rousseau, with charming
piano numbers by Dorothea Macmaster. Ice-
land poppies and sweet-peas made effective
floral decoration amid pictures and sculpture,
Mrs. Richardson’s gown of grey toning in
nicely.
Contributions from over 300 patrons
helped to re-stock the linen-room of
the Women’s Hospital when Mrs. James
Alston directed an afternoon-tea at Scott's
on Thursday. Students of the Albert-street
Con. made music for the company, assisted
by Walter Kirby in some self-accompanied
ditties. Thanks to Fritz Hart and his stu-
dents were voiced by the hostess, and to
Mr. Wilson and the staff of the hotel by AY.
J. T. Clarke. lion, secretary Mrs. D. A.
Skene, Matron Capner, Mrs. Brodie Ainslio.
Mrs. Alec McCracken and a quintette of
Mayoresses South Melbourne, St. Kilda,
Prahran, Essendon and Richmond were
among those who gathered round the tables.
Sister Adelaide’s P.S.:—-
The Glovers are finding that to end a popular
term of mayoral office means as many good-liyo
parties as a trip to Labrador. For her the biggest
surprise came when, answering an invitation to tea
at the Piccadilly, she found herself nursing a dia-
mond and platinum wrist-watch and a jewel-case,
with an address voicing appreciation of her generous
hospitality. The hundred or so signatures include
all our best known. The committee of the Army
Nurses’ Fund bade her to tea too ; from its inception
she has been one of the Fund’s keenest supporters
and is still to be its president. Meanwhile the
Glovers have themselves given a tea, their guests
pressmen and presswomen, who were unanimous that
their host and hostess were a particularly happy
couple to support.
Died on Thursday, Mrs. G. E. Young, wife of the
Dean of Adelaide, in her 82nd year—a recognised
wit of her day. By her first husband, Inspector
Roe, of Westralia, she had five children (one of them
the late Mrs. James Harvey), and there is one daugh-
ter by the second marriage.
The Snows’ beautiful garden at Aldgate was thrown
open for a kindergarten party on Saturday, and pro-
duced tea as well as its amazing wealth of flower?
and shrubs for the benefit of a big muster of child-
ren and grown-ups. The cheque is to go to the
Keith Sheridan kindergarten.
Tennis and croquet are officially “off” till next
season, and at the final tea-party at the Oval prizes
were handed to tournament winners by Mrs. F.
Makin: It isn’t only the male members of the Hill
family who can play games—of six possible croquet
prizes one of Clem’s sisters annexed four, and a tennis
prize fell to another of the family.
The United Arts Club has placed on record its
sympathy with Van Raalte in his “trying experi-
ence” with the Art Gallery authorities and its con-
fidence in him. The first idea was to ventilate the
whole business, but that was abandoned.
The Exhibition was chock-a-block for the final
Butt-Rumford concert, and flowers were heaped
upon the lady. Amethyst and silver were her color
scheme, with a hint of jade in jewellery that was
otherwise diamonds and pearls. Mdlle. Aussenac was
in mastic silk, furred as to hem and jewelled as to
girdle, and there were flowers, too, for her. The
first thing, by the way, that the Rumfords said
when they passed through to the Eastern States
was that “The Iveys of Heaven” had been cast out
of their repertoire—and the last thing they did
was to sing it.
Married in London the other day, Susanna Stewart,
one of the late Alan MacFaVlane grand-daughters, to
Commander A. G. Mack, R.N. Her father was the
late Dr. R. Stewart, and her mother, on her
second marriage, allied herself with one of the
Lambs of N. S. Wales.
The Bridges returned to the usual accompaniment
of official welcomes and receptions—-she with her hair
still intact and no admiration for a shaven feminine
neck. With them are their daughter—grosvn yards
in the short time she has been away—and Miss
Brooke, a sister of their A.D.C.

The fame of a great name
lives in the
I Vestinghouse Battery ,
A Better Battery.
If Westinghouse had not been confident that it could build
a better battery, there would never have been a Westinghouse
Storage Battery.
The common weaknesses of usual battery construction hava
been overcome by Westinghouse engineers, who have
developed many exclusive features that are incorporated in
the Westinghouse Battery.
Among these are—
The one-piece moulded composition case
with double-thick cell divisions built right in.
The oversize elements that give longer life.
The careful construction throughout.
You can buy this better battery with all its up-to-date improve-
ments at no more than you pay for any average battery.
Why take risks? Ensure maximum battery service with a
Westinghouse.

NOTIONS
* * * «
Inia’s Boy (10’s) was the longest-priced
winner at Rosehill (N.S.W.) on Saturday, but so
many horses were backed in each of the nine races
that only dashing adventurers in the medium of
bookmaking could have shown a loss. And there
are few, if any, dashing adventurers fielding on
Sydney courses; most of the gents, behind the bag-
are a stodgy lot whose motto is “Safety First.”
Toohey rode Inia’s Boy, who proved much too good
for Coinage and Pigeondor at the finish of the
flying Handicap. He is a hungry-looking animal,
and very in-and-out, but he can travel when in the
humor. Bunkum (s’s), a smart-looking chestnut
gelding by imported Humbug—Ballet Queen, over-
came the hot favorite Lady Constance and Alua,
another Chrysolaus filly, in the first division of the
Nursery Handicap. Easingwold’s brother, Kelgoola,
was fourth in this race, and would have got a
place but for running out wide in the straight. He
will do better before long. His stable-companion
Linally boil: are trained by Carew—-won the second
division easily, at 4’s, from Ballenderry and Active
Lad. Linally is a brown filly by Linaere—Joan
Alone, and Ballenderry is a son of Chrysolaus-
Malt Craig; Chrysolaus is evidently going to be a
success at the stud. J. M. Cameron’s Maoriland-
bred pony Egyptian Flower (s’s) showed gameness
in the November Handicap, 10 furlongs, and lasted
long enough to beat the fast-finishing Polvere (4’s)
by a neck, with unlucky Bowalla third and Gulgong,
who had rather too much weight, fourth. Egyptian
Flower is by Egypt or Finland—Mint, and is a
good mare for her inches, as she has shown at Rand-
wick before to-day. Consistent Lintress (9 to 2)
landed the Parramatta Mile easily from L.A. (6’s)
and The White Diamond (9 to 2), 1 who perhaps
needed the race and may yet reproduce his two-
year-old form. Since Lintress was beaten by Bos-
worth Field at Moorefield, he has won two handicaps;
and Egyptian Flower, who went under to Bosworth
Field at Warwick Farm, has also . entered the
winning list; which suggests that Bosworth Field
is a fair horse.
* * * *
F. J. Marsden, the Randwick trainer, has
Hemisphere looking pretty well again, and the
four-year-old son of Cyklon—Asturina will have
plenty of support for one of the Christmas handicaps
if he keeps r%ht. Before he met with a mishap in
the spring, he was fancied for the Epsom Handicap,
in which he had Bst. 21b., and with 21b. less he
must be reckoned well handicapped in the Villiers
Stakes, although Tabragalba, the topweight, has only
161 b. more. Sir Alick (Bst. 51b.), Balbus (Bst.
21b.), Irish Prince (Bst.), King Cvllene' (7st. 101 b.),
Anambah (7st. 71b.), Border Chief (7st. 61b.),
Quan Tart (7st. 51b.), Sweet Tress (7st. 21b.) and
Jolly Handsome (6st. 121 b.) are others with nice
weights in the Villiers, which is to be run at Rand-
wick on Dec. 19, but Hemisphere looks like fur-
nishing the best tote bet. For the Summer Cup, to
be decided on Boxing Day, Prince Minimbah (Bst.),
Meenah (7st. 131 b.), Resource (7st. 71b.), Royal
Roug (7st. 41b.2, Highlander (7st. 31b.) and Varney
(7st.) are attractively handicapped. And there is
a four-year-old gelding called Pigeon Pie (Magpie—
Tartlet) who is worth watching. He has 6st. 9lb. in
the Villiers, 6st. 71b. in the Summer Cup and the
same in Tattersall’s Club Cup (Jan. I)—luxurious
weights for a well-bred four-year-old who has won
at a mile in decent company and gallops as if
another four or five furlongs would trouble him
little. Hemisphere and Pigeon Pie may be profitable
to follow at the Christmas meetings .
McShortodds had all the best of the argu-
ment at Sandown Park (Vic.) on Saturday. In
the Sandown Park Handicap, 10 furlongs, Melola,
from Scobie’s stablq, with Daniels on top, defeated
Spearage by half a head after a thrilling finish;
Reputed King, a 2 to 1 favorite, was a close third.
The winner, who was well backed at s’s, had run
poorly the previous Saturday at Epsom. The South
Aus.-owned Shanky was always favorite (9 to 4
when bags were shut), for the Sandown Plate, six
furlongs, and just got up in the last stride to beat
Thunderer, who looked a certain winner at the
distance. The long straight at Sandown suits Shanky,
who is a strong finisher, and pretty fair on his day.
That good horse Quintus was well backed for this
race, but found lOst. a bit too much to handle. A
rather promising sort in Idle Time (Gadabout —
Sylvanelle), whom punters had been waiting! for,
was backed like a certainty for the second division
of the Trial Welter, eight furlongs, and, with Bob
Lewis aboard, easily landed the odds which had to
be laid on him—6 to 4 on for the most part. He
is trained and owned by F. H. Lewis, Robert’s
brother, and is likely to win again, but the others
were a poor lot.
“O.li.”: As 10 Ministerial supporters can-
not be depended upon, there is little hope for the
Tote Bill presently to be introduced in Vic. Assem-
bly. On October 20 a majority of Ministerialists
seemed to be so strong for the measure that the
, Government decided to include it as part of its
’ Budget programme. Since then the refrigerating
work done. by the churches and Mcßook has been
so effective that a frost has set in. It is always the
way in Victoria.
*.* * *
“Hamer”: Isaacs is wealthy enough, but
of penurious habits. The only luxury he allows
himself is losing money at the races, and he is a
bad loser. Remorse for his folly was keener than
usual on his return from a recent meeting ; an oblig-
ing “head” had written out a list of tips for him,
but some he wouldn’t back because the price was
too hot, and others because they were rank out-
siders —“dey gahnt be tryin’,” Isaacs reflected. And
they all won! Isaacs cursed himself all the way
home. It w’as during that dismal progress that a
street-seller stood in his path.. “Buy a bunch of
flowers, Mister ?” he whined. “I shouldn't be sur-
prised,” said Isaacs, bitterly.
* * * *
“Brenda’s Son”: What’s in a name? At
the Richmond (Vic.) Red Hots on Nov. 23, nn
owner-driver incurred the displeasure of the stewards
and was disqualified for 12 months. His name
was Swindels. At the same meeting a rider called
Wynne was given 12 months for losing.
* * * *
“Ding Dong”: Standing in a horse-box
improvised on a trailer drawn by a motor-car, a
steed recently travelled from Swansea to the race-
course at Oatlands (Tas.), a distance of 80 miles.
“Here comes Windbag,” shouted the villagers as
the contraption arrived at the course. None the
worse for his journey over a bumpy road, “Windbag”
ran second in his race, and returned a dividend of
£7 10s. for 10s.

The new stipendiary steward in S.A., to
join Hogan and Clem Hill in place of Tom Wigley,
is Sydney Ferry, who has lately been acting as a
deputy steward and starter. He is a son of the
veteran owner Seth Ferry—still goiny strong in
Adelaide —and was in his day a successful amateur
rider. He won the City Handicap twice (on Norma
and Simpleton) and any number of hurdle races and
steeples.
It was told — in strict confidence, of course
—that Gavino Deleon yearned to knock chips off his
young countryman, Ignacio Fernandez, because the
boy had made it too willing in a training bout.
The two Filipinos met at the Sydney Stadium on
Saturday night, before a large crowd, quite a number
of which had taken the 7 to 4 on Fernandez and
barracked vigorously for Deleon. It should really
have been 10 to 1 on the bronze Apollo, for against
his superior science and terrific hitting, Gavino’s
mad rushes and spectacidar elbow-and-back walloping
were as Orson’s crude efforts against the accomplished
Valentine. He rarely hit Fernandez and he hadn’t
the faintest idea of defence against the young ’un’s
beautifully timed double lefts to the dial and
rights to the jaw, or terrible uppercuts when De-
leon rushed to close quarters. In one spasm Ignacio

landed seven of these in a row. Deleon was so
badly cut up and swollen of feature in the seventh
round that Wallis asked him if he hadn’t had
enough. He said he hadn’t, and he was sent up
again and again to the slaughter. In the 16th
Wallis declined to be a party to it any longer.
Separating the pair from a clinch, he said “That’ll
do,” and placed his hand on Fernandez’s head.
Weights: Deleon, 9st. ; Fernandez, Bst. 811 b. The
conqueror is now to box Grime.
Billy Crime. Australia’s featherweight
and lightweight champion, convincingly Settled the
pretensions of Anglo-American Danny Frush at
Melbourne Stadium. Frush weighed 9st. 511 b. to
Grime’s 9st. lflb., and, standing well up to his
man, opened at a rattling rate. Grime let his
adversary come to him, and for three rounds of
attractive boxing points were level, Frush scoring
with a lightning left and Grime with rights to
the body. The Australian snapped a couple of stiff
rights to Frush’s jaw at the end of the fourth
round, and the visitor went to his corner thought-
fully. In the next (and last) round, the pair
broke from a clinch, and Frush appeared to be
waiting for Grime to shape up when a short right
to the point sent the visitor to the floor, where
he stayed till the count was over by 10 seconds or
so. It was a sparkling fight, and a very good per-
formance on Grime’s part, for Frush has beaten
the great (or once great) Criqui.

“Julian”: In the early days at Bulong
(W.A.) it was customary to play football on
Sunday afternoons. On one occasion arrangements
were made to bring off
a tug-of-war at the
half-time interval. Bar-
rels of money were
wagered on the result,
but the teams were so
evenly matched that
the contest was never
finished. During the
interval no advantage
was gained by either
team, but when the
footballers wanted to
resume the crowd
howled them off—it
was more interested in
the pull. That inde-
cisive affair went on
until darkness fell,
when it was de-
cided to call it a draw.
Some of the competi-
tors had to be assisted
from the cleats, and
some had to be taken
to the hospital. Are
we degenerating ?
ROBERT
WATSON, veteran
of the visiting
English bowlers.
Anderson was sadly missed from the N.S.W.
tennis team which went to Melbourne for the inter-
state contests at the Albert Ground, and the Vic-
torians proved far too good. Meritorious wins were
scored for the visitors by A. Willard, who, after
losing the first set, 2—6, against T. R. Pitchett,
took the next two, 9—7 and 7 —5; and by L.
Baker, whq downed R. C. Wertheim, 9—7, 6 —2;
but these were the only two rubbers which went to
the Ma State. Kalins took a set from Patterson, but
lost the other two. The Victorians were in great
form on the second day, winning six singles matches
and six doubles with the loss of only one set.
which was gained by Kalins and Baker at the ex-
pense of Mclnnes and Pitchett. Schlesinger played
for the conquering State, which included Hawkes,
besides those mentioned; the N. S. Wales team
comprised R. O. Cummings, North and Baylev, in
addition to the trio already named. The youngsters
Haege and Dickinson helped Victoria’s second team
to defeat the South Australians, who were not at
full strength ; and in the women’s matches Victotian
teams defeated N. S. Wales and Tasmania and tied
with South Aus. —16 sets 152 games each. For
N. S. Wales Miss Meaney created a surprise by
overcoming Mrs. OHara Wood (7 —5, 6—B, 9—7),
and, partnered by Miss Biekerton, accounting for
Mrs. O’Hara Wood and Miss Toyne; but on the
sweltering Saturday the N.S.W. women lost their
games as unanimously as the men. The courts were
not in good condition and played tricks; responsi-
bility is placed upon Melbourne’s recent erratic
weather.
« * * *
“Gameanset”: One reason why I don’t
care for tennis is the vast amount of squealing for
which it is responsible, on the courts and off.
Consider this harrowing narrative from Sydney
Telegraph :
“At the last council meeting of the Lawn Tennis
Association of Australia it was decided to write
America expressing ‘the profound regret’ of the Aus-
tralian Association at the decision of the American
body not to send a team to Australia this year, and
informing the Americans that owing to the sad state
of the finances of the home association it was quite
possible that Australia would have to discontinue
participating in Davis Cup matches. The American
Association was severely criticised. Mr. Utz stated
that we in Australia were at the end of our tether
and it was up to America to do something for
Australia. Australia had done much for American
tennis in the past, but America would not recipro-
cate.’’
What pitiful rubbish, and how unworthy of the
country that bred the Diggers ! I hold no brief for
the Yanks, but when Australia held the Davis Cup
they sent a team to Melbourne in 1908, another to
Sydney in 1909 and a third to Christchurch in
1911 without raising the miserable cry that America
had done a lot for Australian tennis and that Aus-
tralia should show its gratitude by insisting on its
best players going to America regardless of their
private affairs. What right have the American
authorities to order Tilden, Johnston and Richards
to quit their presumably, lucrative jobs and leave
for Australia by the first boat? Why should they
consider this country more than any of those which
take part in the Davis Cup competition year after
year ar.d never participate in the challenge-round
gates? As to that, the Australian authorities have
drawn substantial profits from the Davis Cup matches
in at least two years, which profits have been dis-
sipated, to a large extent, in useless extravagance
and unnecessary trips. I suppose the Yanks are too
polite to remind them of the fact.
* * * *
Playing for Queensland against a very
unrepresentative N.S.W. team, captained by Oldfield,
at Brisbane, Hornibrook failed to get a wicket in
N.S.W.’s first innings, which closed for 287 (Phillips
78, Oldfield 52 and Punch 49). Not so the con-
sistent Oxenham, who dismissed five N. S. Welshmen
—Dwyer, Oldfield, Morrissey, Campbell and White
-—for 37, a feat which he followed by making 96
against the bowling of Everett, Morrissey, Campbell
and Punch. O’Connor, the wicketkeeper, also main-
tained his reputation for usefulness; he caught two
men, helped to run out two others, let only six
sundries go by, and hit up 44. There is a feeling
in Queensland that one of these two men should
have been picked for the Trial Test in preference
to. Hot nib rook, who has done nothing in first-class
cricket since 1921, and whose claims for inclusion
in the Australian XI are small compared with those
of that other left-hander, Macartney.
# * $
“George”: The barracker may be an inflic-
tion, but he has his bright moments. My mind
goes back to a very hot day in November, 1921,
when the Victorian bowlers were straining every
nerve to dislodge Hobbs and Hearne, who had taken
root and threatened to stay at the sticks for hours.
Runs came infrequently, and the onlookers waxed
sarcastic at the batsmen’s expense, one humorist
demanding the time from Carl Willis after every
over—Carl’s wristless watch was always a source of
joy to the crowd. At length, after a more deadly
spell of stonewalling than ordinary, a despairing
voice came floating across the ground: “I don’t mind
payin’ two bob to come in. It’s puttin’ the gun
in for the amusement tax that gets me.”
* * * *
“Tren”: The cricketing world will miss
the criticisms and advice of Sydney Pardon, editor of
Wisden’s. who has just died. He' was the third of
the family to be connected with the Almanack ; E.
S. Pardon had 12 years’ editorial service, then came
C.F. for four years, and Sydney followed. Wonder-
fully acute for a very short-sighted man, Syd fore-
told the coming glories of Trnmper’s career on Vic-
tor’s first appearance in England, and prophesied
when Hobbs was a youngster that the Surrey man
would be a world’s batsman. He used to make a
point of telling Australians who engaged him in
conversation that Jack Blackham did not invent
modern wicket-keeping. “It was Tom Lockyer, of
Parr’s 1863-1864 team, who taught Australia the
art,” the veteran would insist, although he generally
wound up by admitting that Blackham improved on
his instructor.
* * * *
“Bill R.” : A cricketer wasted on the
desert air is Picalla, one of the few remaining full-
bloods of the Wallaga mission station (N.S.W.). His
powers with both bat and ball and his uncanny
agility afield were some years ago discovered by
M. A. Noble, who was then touring the South
Coast with a city team. Noble’s offer of a city job
and a place in the best cricket company was, how-
ever, turned down by the dusky athlete with the
apology: “My bin think it my bin plurry soon lose
myself in Sydney.” Since then Picalla has been
the constant star in the far South Coast cricketing
firmament. But his wholesome dread of big towns
has clung to him.
* * * *
In the last Sydney premiership round
Tommy Andrews, the Petersham all-rounder, banged
103 (on a wet wicket) and 110 not out (in 90
minutes) v. Cumberland. Thereby he equalled one
of Trumper’s records—the great Victor had previ-
ously been the only N.S.W. batsman to make two
centuries in a club match confined to two days.
Andrews, who is in fine form this season, has an
average of 79.40, second only to the remarkable
figures of W. Coltman, who has had four not-outs
in five innings and averages 226. The ’Varsity
crack, Otto Nothling, is also distinguishing himself
- —he got 9 for 15 v. Marrickville. Next to Kelle-
way, Nothling is the best medium-paced right-hander
bowling in club cricket.
* * * *
“George”: Both Adelaide public schools
have supplied numbers of inter-State cricketers (B.
26/11/’25). Clem Hill and Joe Darling were pro-
ducts of Prince Alfred College, as also were Kirk-
wood, Roy and Solly Hill (less famous than their
illustrious brother, but fine players all the same),
C. E. Dolling, who should have had a trip to Eng-
land in 1912, C. F. Drew, Townsend, Don and Ken
Steele, Willsmore, Middleton and Gar Hone, better
known as a tennis star. St Peter’s, too, has done
its share with Jennings, Moyes, Campbell, the
Pellews, Murray, Rymill, Gun and Jose. Two of these
have played for Australia, and two more were
members of the ill-fated side which was chosen to
visit Africa what time Germany was preparing for
a different game. With some of those mentioned,
and such lads as Lee, Alexander and Giffen coming
along, the two colleges should be well represented
for some years ahead. By comparison, the Sydney
colleges have had few young men in N'.S.W.
elevens, during the last decade at all events. The
only one I can remember at the moment is J.
M. Taylor, who stepped from the Newington side
into the State team.
* * * *
“Matahari”: J. F. Peake, well known as
a Rugby Union umpire, is managing the team of
Mnoriiand cricketers now visiting Australia. They are
all young fellows apart from the manager and the
captain, W. R. Patrick, who was over here with the
last M.L. side before the war • and they say they
have come over to learn. Dacre, who made a
century in each innings v. Mayne’s Victorians, is a
member of the side, and his companions expect him
to make a lot of runs. Queensland is to be en-
countered first.
* * * *
“Winkle” : While thousands of Australians
were arguing that Pritchard should be given his
chance in the Trial Test, Warwick Armstrong was
making an unobtrusive reappearance in pennant
cricket. Now 46, the big fellow has by no means
lost the form that made him, with Noble and Giffen,
one of our three best cricketers. His premature retire-
ment puzzled the public as much as did the many
peculiar incidents that marked his career —his
threatened disqualification in 1904 ; the bickerings he
was connected with when the selection committee
took the right to elect the captain from the players;
his exclusion from the Vic. side, though captain,
against Douglas’s team; and his reinstatement as a
lilywhite amateur though the public was unaware
he had been branded as a professional. And he
•was allowed to retire without an official voice try-
ing to coax him back. If AVarwick were available
there would be less need for anxiety about our
chances in the next Tests.
HARD NAMES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“I know a bookie who earned a reputation for
singularity by pronouncing Bete Noir correctly.”—•
(B. 26/ll/ J 25.)
When urged to fasten on your colt or filly
Something in foreign tongue or classic strain,
A name that sounds appropriate and frilly,
The coinage of some friendly scholar’s brain,
Think of the man who’ll have to howl it shrilly
Or roar it boisterously—and refrain.
It may be sport for you, but ’twill be grim
Torture, mayhap, for him.
Albeit he must raise stentorian clamor
His living from the racecourse crowds to wrench,
’Tis odds he never mastered Latin grammar
Or can express himself (like you) in French;
And there are words that make him choke and
stammer
Or bite his tongue and impotently clench
His teeth. Forbear, my thoughtless friends, to try
The patient ring too high.
“L’Abbesse de Jouarre” someone called a neddy
In England once —a cruel jest and raw—
And many a cheek grew pale and hand unsteady
In places where the “clanging rookery” caw;
Some doffed their bags and took away the ready,
But others made it “Abscess on the Jaw.”
And served him right who gave the fielding pack
A nut like that to crack.
Best stick to names familiar and prosaic,
Or if to foreign fields you needs must go,
Well, anything that’s Yiddish or Hebraic
Would have an element of comme il jaut.
A racehorse with a moniker Mosaic—
Say, wouldn’t that appeal to Ikey Mo?
And oif his tongue how faultlessly be reeled
Where’er they lay the field! *

"V. McC.”: Quaint place-names? A re-
cently-selected property near St. George (Q.)
lias been named Upson Downs.
“Ivsmith”: My neighbor Bjones got one
in the other day, at any rate. “Cook your-
self an egg to-night, James,” cooed his wife
as he was starting for the train; “I won’t
be home till late.” “What’s up now?" asked
Bjones. “There’s a Feminist at-home,” she
chirruped. “Well, thank the Lord for that,”
shouted Bjones over his shoulder; “it’s the
last place one would expect to find her!”
“Verri”: The remarks of “Nat Lew” (B.
5/11/’25) on the doubtful advantages of in-
tense physical culture will find endorsement
in M.L., where the Government some time
ago appointed a well-known exponent of the
craze as instructor in the public schools.
When this instructor died suddenly after
climbing a hill, and the trouble was diag-
nosed as heart-strain, there was considerable
perturbation in the Dominion, and physical
culture in other than a mild form slumped.
“Coppertop” : The first Solomon Islander
to receive recognition from the Royal Hu-
mane Society is Peter Deve, an old man
employed on the King’s Wharf, Suva. On
two previous occasions when he saved
from drowning he managed to evade
notice, but his third bit of life-saving Was
too public to pass unnoted. On April 22
the boatswain of the steamer St. Stephen fell
overboard, and Deve dived in, fully clothed,
and rescued him. The bronze medal of the
R.H.S. is Peter’s guerdon.
“R. 8.”: Touching on the kinship of a
suburban resident of Sydney with Lord
Nelson (B. 5/11/’25) and through him. with
Queen Anne Boleyn, the writer of this par.
has a genealogy which traces back in an
unbroken line (or sufficiently so to satisfy
the cautious Heralds’ College) his own
descent from Queen Catharine Parr, bluff
King Hal’s sixth and last matrimonial ex-
periment. The late Dr. Maclaurin’s vivid
representation of Henry and his wives and
their troubles has given to this involved and
spidery record an interest no mere personal
association could, have done.
“R.Q.”: Two brothers met for the first
time the other day, although they had both
been employees of the same firm, the one
for 37 years and the other for 19. The
elder brother entered the cable service in
Maoriland at the age of 16, and went abroad
at 18; the younger brother was born a few
months after his departure. One spent his
furloughs in Australia and England and the
other at home, and in their frequent moves
about the extensive cable system their paths
never crossed until the youngster stumbled
on his big brother living in retirement in
London. They come of a taciturn Scotch
breed, and the meeting was a short one.
“Ho didn’t even ask me to come and have
a- drink,” commented the junior member
afterwards.
“Black Tracker”: Railway Commissioner
Webb, of South Aus., has shown that he
appreciates grit. When on a visit of inspec-
tion the train on which he was travelling
was held up at a small station. Leaving his
official party, the chief wandered around tak-
ing stock. Something caught his attention
outside the platform, but as he attempted
to pass through the gate a young porter
promptly blocked the way.and demanded his
ticket. Webb tried to brush the porter aside,
but was firmly told that even if he were
the chief himself he had not a hope of get-
ting through. At this juncture the s.m.
appeared, and with many apologies set things
right. When, the train had passed on the
junior learned what his immediate superior
thought of him, and was warned that he
would hear more about it after the Commis-
sioner’s return. The prophecy proved cor-
rect. The porter was notified soon after-
wards that he had been promoted to a post
in the city.
Anthony Camming, Queensland’s Govern-
ment Printer, is still as direct in speech
as he was in his old Sydney days when ho
inspired “Smiler” Hales to write the Me-
dusky stories. He did not get on well at
first with State Governor Nathan, who re-
sented his freedom of speech, and for a long
time his Ex. wasn’t playing speaks. Then
dimming discovered that the Governor, when
he wanted any official printing done, .was in
the habit of sending an aide to give instruc-
tions to subordinate officials at the Printing
Office. This was lese-majcste, and not to
be borne; so the chief issued orders: “The
next time that gold-braided blanker comes
here, you send him in to me.” When the
aide came in, Gumming roared at him:
“What does that adjective boss of yours
mean by sending you to give orders to my
men behind my back? You go home and tell
him that if he wants any printing done here
he will come to me about it.” The aide pro-
tested that this was no way to speak about
the Governor. “Isn’t it?” cried Cummmg.
“Well, you tell your boss lie may be Gover-
nor of the State, but I am governor of this
establishment.” They got to know one
another much better afterwards.
“Percy Pinktape” : Those conjugal incom-
patibilities which so often lead to the Divorce
Court take various forms, but a species or
domestic warfare recently ventilated before a
Melbourne magistrate seems to have been
a more than usually expensive one. To mark
his annoyance with his wife’s conduct, the
husband destroyed one of her dresses, wiiere-
upon she got the scissors and ripped up one
of his suits. When arguments waxed
warmer, furniture and other property suf-
fered, the male partner destroying articles
which his spouse most treasured, whilst the
lady retaliated upon his dearest possessions.
It w r as pathetically mentioned that practi-
cally everything in the house w r as smashed,
the consequent absence of home comforts
having doubtless contributed to the husband’s
disappearance. What the relatives must
have regarded as an even more unpleasant
method of wmrfare was adopted by another
pair. When trouble started, the wife
promptly set off to the houses of her hus-
band’s relatives or friends and started to
abuse them, whilst hubby hurried off. post-
haste to treat some of her kinsfolk similarly.
One of them resented the procedure with
blows, and in the assault case that foljowed
the magistrate told the plaintiff that lie
deserved all he got if he went round abusing
people. The aggrieved person protested that
he ought to have the same rights as his wife;
but the Law declined to give a ruling.

“Wildflower” is back again at Sydney
Koyal. It is rather thin stuff to be revived
so soon, but familiarity has not bred con-
tempt for the Coleman-Upward scenery or
the humorous efforts of Charles Zoli, Gus
Bluett—a young man who keeps on improv-
ing—and Marie Ga Varre. Also, Noel Allan
makes a reasonably convincing Alberto,
Gwen Ives justifies her promotion, and Marie
Burke smiles incessantly when she isn’t tear-
ing a passion to tatters or dancing the Bam-
balina, or singing effectively with or with-
out that solemn lover, Herbert Browne.
Further, Casino dances with unabated
energy in the South American manner—if it
is the South American manner—and has a
lively partner in Myrtle Reeve, whose nice
legs would look nicer still in tights. And
John Forde shows the young people how well
an old-timer can carry himself and speak
’his lines. Custom has staled the music more
than any other feature of “Wildflower,” but
the piece has been put on again mostly for
the benefit of people who haven’t heard the
music, being denied the felici / of radio
orchestras, tea-and-pie trios am other tri-
umphs of civilisation. Such people will find
three or four compositions delightful; the
others don’t matter.

That popular member of the family,
“Charley’s Aunt,” reappeared on Saturday
at the Sydney Grand Opera House after a
long and regretted absence. In the mani.<> r
of her sex, the dear old girl is younger to-day
than she was 30 years ago, and threatens
to go on getting younger for another 30 years
—and long before then the rubbish that is
being produced these days will be as for-
gotten as an election promise. The comedy
carries on in spite of a company which is
anything but first-rate, and should fill the
big theatre for weeks to come. It is the
same shrieking farce that it always was—
clean, obvious humor that is liable to be
disastrous to any waistcoat or its feminine
equivalent (if there is one) that won’t
allow liberties to be taken with it. If the
Ward-Fuller co. wants to relieve suffering
humanity it will revive the show at about
income-tax time. “Charley’s Aunt” is one
of the few things capable of brightening a
gloomy community at such a time of trouble.
* * * *
The show, of course, depends on the
"Aunt.” Frank Neil carries the responsi-
bility much better than this Showman had
believed that anybody except Frank Thorn-
ton could carry it; and his load would be
lightened if he had better support. How-
ever, though none of the others are worthy
of many bouquets, none of them call for a
brick, and that is something to be thank-
ful for.
“Leave it to you”—how oft you hear them
heave it
Across the cards, the bridge-fiend’s stock
refrain.
But Her Maj.’s all the players “Leave
To Jane.”

Frank Rigo’s new company is busy digging
itself in at the Sydney Hippodrome, where it
will shortly commence its season of Italian
and French grand opera. The other night
the manager invited the press and friends
to a rehearsal of “The Barber,” which will
open the season on the 19th, and proved that
lie has some fine voices in the cast. The
Figaro and Rosina and Bertha made an
immediate appeal, even in the unwarmed
atmosphere of an undress rehearsal.

Edna Thomas is still making the Swannee
River and such like sound as good as new
at the Sydney Conservatorium. Also she has
overcome her original school-marm desire to
draw attention to the points of her perform-
ance. Her crinolines and hustles and ring-
letted head help with the atmosphere in the
Creole songs; but the voice is a little too
complacent in the spirituals—no great surge
of the uplifted heart about Miss Thomas’s
rendering! Harpist Lucile Lawrence twangs
more than melodiously, and is mistress of
quite an extensive literature for her instru-
ment ; Constance Piper, at the piano, does
her bit remarkably well, though of course to
be really in the picture the instrument should
be a spinet.

This week when the bell calls Sydney
Tivoli’s male patrons from the Castlereagh-
street asphalt at the end of the interval,
they are greeted by a ribald ditty sung by
a raucous-voiced person in woman’s clothes.
After emphasising a life-long devotion to
knitting and hanging some frayed underwear
on a clothes-line, the comedian, Bruce Green,
shuffles off and a hush falls on the audience.
Then the curtain rushes skywards, and a'siim
young English johnny steps quietly from
the wings. It is Ella Shields, and many
minutes elapse before a wildly-cheering audi-
ence allows her to start. The joviality that
enchanted Sydney four years ago is not quite
so rollicking this time, and the buoyancy of
a few of her minor numbers that aro tinged
with Americanisms seems a little forced;
but her “Jolly Good Fellows” with its rhyth-
mic swing is destined to be in constant de-
mand. “Burlington Bertie” remains her
masterpiece, and its popularity should
strengthen her resistance to the temptation
of trashy jazz turns.
Fourteen years ago Bobby Leach, cramped
in a nailed-up barrel, was tossed into the
torrent that rushes over Niagara Falls and
came through his foolish adventure without
serious injury. To-day Bobby, with the aid
o, a moving picture, is telling Sydney Fuller-
Res of his experience. Of course, it lacks
the thrill of an actual view; but it is fairly
exciting. Blondi Robinson, a coon from
overseas, who indulges in an amusing eccen-
tric dancing turn, provokes a laugh every
time he lifts his feet; but the Harris Instru-
mentalists are a family of musicians who
must carry their lives in their hands.

The war picture, like the war novel, has
had its vogue, and “Havoc,” with its khaki-
c-ad characters and background of bursting
shells and torn landscapes, is not causing a
phenomenal rush to Hoyt’s this week. De-
spite its depressing atmosphere the film
deserves more attention. The post-war re-
action seems to favor films of the free-and-
easy and fantastic order, of which “The
Shock Punch” at the Empress is a fair
example, though the spectacle of a person

ton and Tom Roberts should call at the Hordern
Gallery before the 24th. There is a bv
Tom Roberts of Coogee Bay—a gem in turquoise,
Jerald and gold—painted in lbos. Coputu
his comrade on this landscape hunt; and Conder sold
his day’s bag for one guinea. Roberts is repre-
sented, too, by some beautiful—fragrant had almost
been written—flower studies. Streeton’s fine Chep-
stowe Castle glooms in sun and shadow; and an
interesting bit is his picture of the old Orient wharf
with steamers straining at the leash. This was his
first painting of Sydney, and the first work of his
sold in this city. Count Nerli, the man who
painted one of the few portraits of Robert Louis
Stevenson, shows a crimson-haired lady who looks as
though contemplating an early-morning dose of
senna. Philip Fox’s charm is best expressed by a
moonrise that might have happened in a midsummer
night’s dream; and there are tree-crowned corners of
Elizabeth Bay and Cremorne in the days when the
flat locust had not visited the land.
“THE FARMER’S WIFE,” AT MEL-
BOURNE THEATRE ROYAL.
Farmer Samuel Sweetland (Townsend Whit-
ling) rejects the advances of Postmistress
Susan Maine (Ettie Landau).
Previous good impressions of “The Farm-
er’s Wife” are confirmed by a second view;
but the continued failure of Townsend Whit-
ling to keep up to the standard he now and
then reaches as Samuel Sweetland indicates
that his inability to be completely satisfac-
tory was not solely due to the weight of his
first-night responsibilities as producer. How-
ever, it is good fare; and robust attendances
at the Melbourne lioyal show a popular ap-
preciation of it.

“The Street Singer,” at Melbourne
Majesty’s, makes nightly collections which
are quite satisfactory to the management.
* * *' *
The surprising feat the Melbourne Athe-
naeum management put up with Edna Thomas,
who started with not good houses and finished
with full ones, is likely to be repeated with
“Give and Take.” At that show one day
last week this Showman met a Melbourne
manufacturer who claimed to have seen it
six times, each time carrying along other
manufacturers. His idea is that the play
teaches industrial lessons. It seems a curi-
ously serious way to view a farce meant only
to be amusing; yet the story upon which the
fat flesh of laughter is moulded certainly is
a more than usually sturdy skeleton.
* * *
The process of weekly changes brought a
revival of “It Pays to Advertise” to Mel-
bourne King’s on Saturday. Cyrus Martin
(very well done by Arthur Cornell) was the
irascible soap-manufacturer, and as the
advertising fanatic, Ambrose Peale, Carl
Lawson was given a chance, of which he
made artistic use. Bright assistance was
given by Beryl Barraclough, as the Comtesse
de Beaurien, the bogus Frenchwoman from
the New York underworld who is prepared
to put money into the concern on the pros-
pect of getting 5000 good dollars change for
her cheque ; John Galway made Ellery Clarke
as lackadaisical as he should be, and Nellie
Bramley, apart from her habit of skating
from one word to another, was successful as
Mary Grayson. “The Third Degree” follows
on Saturday.
* * ** *
When seen last at Melbourne Tivoli, Her-
sehel Ilenlere was in a more serious mood;
and Rupert Hazell, “the man who made
the King laugh,” was making the g»ds laugh
too. Several new people are at work this week,
including Walter Nillson, who has that dear
old familiar friend, “America’s Most Novel
Act.”
Keeping to the full vaudeville programme,
Melbourne Bijou has farewelled Nellie Kolle,
who was given a great send-off, and added
turns which include Belle and Morris in
“The New Attendant”; Mae Regae, whose
dancing is alluring; Phil Lopez, a comical
juggler whose humor is sometimes tiresome
but often laugh-raising; and “The Little-
johns.” This pair present an act made
dazzling by a myriad brilliants which catch
the lights and twinkle at the audience as
they balance on moving balls which are also
gleaming masses of light points. It is a
well-staged act, and should make fine busi-
ness for the optician.

The Orpheus Club Choir opened its
account with a concert at the Melbourne
Queen’s Hall last week. At its best an
organisation of women’s voices is not a very
impressive medium for choral music, and it
is to be hoped that the initial performance
will not be the new choir’s best. Uncertainty
and a frayed delivery marked the singing of
“Look Down, O Lord”; Sullivan’s “Oh,
Hush Thee, My Baby” was very much better,
and there was high artistic merit in Eleanor
Lagal’s “The Winter May Wane,” the
soprano solo in Grieg’s “Spring Cycle.” Rus-
sell Callow and Cecil Parkes assisted the
ladies.
** $ *
Dorothea Macmaster, who is going to
Europe to study, operated the piano at the
Assembly Hall (Melb.), at a complimentary
concert tendered by her friends, with skill
find occasional brilliancy, a Liszt rhapsody
being particularly elegant. Contralto Isobel
Riddell and soprano Violet Jackson were
conspicuous among the musicians who helped
to make the concert better than most.
** * *
“Is Love. Everything?” is at the Majestic
(Melb.) this week, and the answer is given
with a well-arranged climax. “Justice of
the Far North” is the supporting film. Hoyt’s
has an amusing picture in “I’ll Show You
the Town,” the tale of the wooing of a
wealthy widow by an impecunious young
professor who wants to save a bankrupt col-
lege; his attempts to entertain her and an-
other woman at the same time and place are
laughable. “Hearts and Spurs” fills a good
part of the rest of the programme with
swift action and “Buck” Jones.

Fritz Hart’s “O Gloriosa Domina,” set
to music for women’s voices, violin, English
horn and piano, was the main portion of
the banquet presented by the Albert-street
Conservatorium at the Assembly Hall on
Saturday night. The music is built upon a
poem of Richard Crashaw, who died in 1650,
and Fritz Hart has not failed in represent-
ing its spiritual qualities. In its exposition
he had able assistance, with Gertrude Healy
playing the violin, Dr. Rudall with the Eng-
lish horn, Ida Scott at the piano, and a
body of women’s voices excellently trained.
The ovation given to the composer was a
tribute, deserved; his “Salve Caput” was
later given by the same assistants, with addi-
tional help from Lilian Stott in a soprano
solo. Again with that delightful violinist,
Gertrude Healy, Bach’s “Three Choral Pre-
ludes”. (Fritz Hart’s arrangement for violin
and piano) was amongst the successes of the
evening, Hart himself being at the piano.
* * *
With some early roasting weather, Adel-
aide show's are settling down to whatever is
the summer equivalent of hibernation. The
main mark of the season is the start of the
Williamson So-and-So’s at the Exhibition
Garden; the two Georges, Gee and Welch,
and Adele Crane have prominent parts, and
Lee White has left her “peaches” to grace
the show. The Anderson melodrama co. has
started again at the Prince of Wales. “Quo
Vadis” at West’s is the big thing on the
screen, making all one’s memories of the old
stage version seem cheap. At the York is
Zane Grey with “1000 people, 2000 buffalo”
(count them for yourself if you don’t be-
lieve it). The Conservatorium students have
struck a new idea with two evenings of
opera, directed by Clive Carey, at a suburban
hall. And Clara Butt has uplifted at the
Town Hall, and finally at the Exhibition
(with the massed thousands helping to sing
“Land of H. and G.” really well), a voice
which seems hardly any the worse for the
flight of years, though Rumford’s shows dis-
tinct signs of wear.

From an Adelaide critic:—
The Australian Painter-Etchers’ Society has a show
of etchings at the Dunster Gallery in Adelaide.
This medium is mainly known to S.A. through Van
Raalte, who has in the present show some of his
characteristic trees, and Goodchild of the severe
line—Melbourne Art Gallery has just bought several
of his things. Lee Hankey, of England, has some of
his rather dreary figure studies, and distinctly
gloomy is Stanley Anderson’s human “Wreckage,”
on which the Art Gallery of Adelaide has cast a
favorable eye—as also on a Friedensen study of
the Burragorang Valley. Fullwood, Squire Morgan,
Ure Smith and Bruce Robertson also attract; but
to this critic Long’s “Riverside” old house with
trees is the gem of the collection.

The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the necessity
of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn,
tennis, and bowling dubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more .than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes. .... . . , ..
The running cost of an ‘'ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture. , ~ ~
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.

“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : Toti dal Monte is
being given a real chance to “make good”
on the English concert platform, and the
manner of the little dimpled dumpling has
already won her throngs of friends. In the
velvety quality of voice and supreme suavity
of production she more nearly resembles
Melba than any singer who has appeared
in London for 20 years. In several of her
English concerts Dal Monte shares the pro-
gramme with Moiseiwitsch, most cultured
of modern pianists. At their Albert Hall con-
cert in late October there was a large
audience, but not a full house. The Queen
of Spain with a large party occupied the
Royal box and warmly applauded Dal Monte.
It was, by the way, one of the now increas-
ingly frequent occasions when the National
Anthem was not played.
“Hamer”: Tal Ordell, actor and Bulletin
contributor, lias written an Australian bush
comedy, “Kangaroo Flat,” which E. J.
Carroll intends to produce at the Melbourne
Athenaeum about Christmas-time. It has
had an encouraging reception in “the pro-
vinces”; at Cairns (N.Q.) the show was
"booked out,” and Wagga (N.S.W.) estab-
lished a local record in its honor. Ordell
was Ginger Mick in the stage production of
"The Sentimental Bloke” and Dave in the
“On Our Selection” picture; he has played
high-class comedy with Marie Tempest,
musical comedy with Maud Fane, and
sketches of his own at the Tivoli. lu fact,
he has done pretty well everything on the
boards except grand opera. He can be
wished nothing better than some of the same
luck which “On Our Selection” secured.
“A. Mateur”: “The Abbess of Wliitby,’
words by L. P. Leary, music by Eric Waters,
the builders of the successful “Tutank-
hamen,” is another good advt. for M.L. enter-
prise. The Auckland Amateur Operatic
Society, which introduced “Tutankhamen” to
the world, has staged this second local effort.
There is some comic relief in the story, but
most of the “book” is straight strong stuff of
the old-fashioned kind, including a death, a
funeral, an ordeal by fire, a witch’s cave and
an attempted poisoning. The time is cer-
turies before the Norman Conquest, when
Saxon kings were scrapping for the over-
lordsliip. L. P. Leary’s share is effective
without being distinguished, but the com-
poser has done really good work. The acting
and singing were good, and what with tliiy
and the success of the local Little Theatre,
Auckland is beginning to fancy itself.
“Branksome” : With Renee Kelly’s co., which
arrived in Melbourne by the Narkunda this
week, Reginald New’son came back to his
home town. He loft it in the early days
of the war, and did three years with the
7th A.L.H.; it was after he had starred with
some amateur theatricals in Egypt that he
was offered a place in Maurice Bandman’s
co. to go to “the East.” From there he
went to London and toured the provinces for
a year in “Romance,” and for three years
in “Eliza Comes to Stay.” Before leaving
for Australia he played at the Little Theatre
(London) in “The Vortex,” and afterwards
went on tour with it; and altogether he can
now count up 26 plays in which he has had
something to say—and that's not including
the little bits he did when he was a member
of Gregan McMahon’s Repertory 00. in the
years before the war. Newson is a hard
worker, and there will be one member of
Renee Kelly’s company, at any rate, who
will be almost desperately anxious to make
good in Australia. The co. is to open in
Melbourne in good time for the holiday trade.
From the young lady’s mother: —
“F.W.” (B. 19/11/’25) is right about Margot
Lester. She is playing with Laura Hope Crewes at
the Maxine Elliott Theatre under Shubert’s manage-
ment, and on the opening night Noel Coward took
his author’s Call leading Laura Hope Crewes by one
hand and Margot by the other. But my husband is
not “the late” Edwin Lester. He has been very
much in evidence at the Melbourne Athenaeum Theatre
in “Give and Take.”
“A.G.M.” from Loudon :
The Home Secretary has just caused a first-class
sensation by refusing permission for public perform-
ance to a new dance-band from America. This
action has brought to a head the definite antagonism
which has been brewing between the musical and
dramatic worlds of England and America. A few
months ago, when Lee Shubert, of New York, secured
control in one coup of six leading London theatres,
there were so many sore heads among English actors
that Shubert eventually issued a placating announce-
ment that he would not use these theatres for his
own productions, but would lease them to the most
attractive tenants.
The beautiful Maxine Elliott is one of Lee Shubert’s
partners, and it was in association that they built
the Maxine Elliott Theatre in New York, which now
brings in a splendid income to the versatile Maxine
and enables her to run a superb town house in St.
John’s Wood. Her niece, Jean Forbes Robertson,
has just made a very decided bit in Jevan Brandon
Thomas’s new play, “The Glory of the Sun” ; this
SHE'D KEEN TO AN ART SHOW ONCE.
THE DAUGHTER: “I’m going to have mg portrait painted by Flotilla Dubbo."
THE MOTHER ( apprehensively ): “My dear! Not in the nood?”
daughter of celebrated players made a living character
of a not very sympathetic part.
One of the first victims of the Home Secretary’s
new activity was Daisy Saville, the accomplished
little niece of Frances Saville, and grandchild of
Martin and Fanny Simonsen, who gave grand opera
in Australia when the musical roads were not paved
with gold. She had studied music in Prague,
Munich, Zurich, and, latterly, in London with
Albert Sammons, who pronounced her an exceptionally
gifted violinist, an opinion confirmed by' those who
heard her in solo work or in the London orchestra
where she had secured a permanent post. Her
father, Willie Simonsen, generally regarded as an
Australian, happened to have been born in America,
and when his little daughter was coming from
Prague to London she was consequently supplied
with an American passport. This made her an alien.
The Home Office refused her permission to earn her
living, and she had to repair to America, where she
has found helpful friends among the fellow-citizens
so strangely thrust upon her. She is a pretty girl,
and not yet of age.
Some of the acidity in the attitude of English
actors towards their American brothers is no doubt
due to the prosperous conditions in Manhattan com-
pared with the depression in London, where many
first-class players accept engagements at £lO a week.
For the limited circle of stars there are always star
salaries on both sides of the Atlantic, hut America
offers the greater return ; hence many English actors
spend most of their time there. Straight drama finds
little support in England. Basil Dean, the well-
known producer who recently married Lady Mercy
Greville, daughter of the famous Countess of Warwick,
has just said: “The people in England really don’t
care for the theatre any more. There is very little
sustained interest in it.” An interesting sidelight
is supplied by the fact that English plays are boom-
ing in Germany, where Shaw, Somerset Maugham,
Sutro, Galsworthy, Jerome and other popular writers
are having successful performances in Berlin and the
other leading cities.
The Anglo-American stage-quarrel has, of course,
embraced the American film, and has now been
switched on to concert and music-hall songs, so
many of which hail from Columbia. Talbot O’Farrell
explains that vaudeville artists have to sing American
songs because English writers no longer supply suit-
able numbers. But, then, O’Farrell’s Irish songs
might with equal propriety hail from Constantinople
or Shanghai. The large royalties demanded by pro-
minent artists for introducing songs has some-
thing- to do with the deterioration of the vaudeville
ballad, which nowadays is mostly slush.
“M.G.S.” : Ella Shields, who landed back
in Sydney the other day, brought the refresh-
ing news that Britain is tired of jazz comedy,
and that even in the land of its birth a
slower tempo on the stage is being called for.
Any relief at this end, however, need not
be expected for some time to come. The
latest musical comedy let loose in Sydney
was running two years ago in U.S.A., and
displays all the qualities of pep and hurry
of the worst period of jazz; and, anyhow,
most of Australia’s amusers have filled their
programme for a year or so ahead. Mean-
time, London audiences are flocking to the
old sort of vaudeville entertainment, which
is where a good many nerve-shattered Aus-
tralian playgoers would like to be.
“White Way”: In the New York produc-
tion of Noel Coward’s “Vortex,” Amy Slier-
win’s daughter Jeanette has made a notice-
able success as the drawling flapper. The
play and the entire English co. had an en-
thusiastic welcome. With justice many Eng-
lish visitors have complained about the rigors
of the American immigration law’s; but so far
the Yankee attitude towards English players
has been one of unlimited hospitality.
Although only 26, Coward, who recently had
four plays running simultaneously in London
—-one of them musical —is already a rich
man by liis own efforts. When he had com-
pleted “The Vortex” little more than a year
ago, he asked Lilian Braithwaite if she would
help him out, explaining that he had no
money, and could offer her only £5 a week
and a share of the profits. She was then
about to sign a contract at her usual terms
of over £lOO a week, but she was so impressed
by the play and the author that for the good
of her artistic soul she accepted the offer,
and is now reaping a rich reward. Young
Coward lias written some excellent music.
“A.G.M.”: (Loud.): Oscar- Asche’s new
production at the Gaiety is supported by all
the essentials of stagecraft that brains and
money can supply. The leading lady, Miss
Margaret Cochran (Lady Hamilton Grant),
rides her superb horse Don through various
scenes, and a complete pack of hounds is
another accessory. “The Good Old Days”
is the name Oscar has given to his new
play, a romantic musical comedy for which
Percy Fletcher has written the music. In-
teresting situations are embellished with
scenes of spectacular splendor such as used
to thrill Drury-lane melodrama. A recon-
ciliation has been effected between Mr.
Asclie and Miss Brayton, and they jointly
direct the production.
“Hamfat”: Bad times in Britain are re-
sponsible not only for the increasing inclina-
tion of imported entertainers to remain in
Australia, sacrificing their contract right to
a return-ticket, but for the return of many
Australians on their own account. Gerald Mal-
vern. who belongs to a well-known Vic. legal
family, has come back after an absence of
23 years. Among other things he was sec-
retary to the British Actors’ Film Associa-
tion, which, after battling for nine years,
has had to close down—American and Ger-
man competition is too strong. Other arri-
vals include Robert Needham, who left Aus-
tralia for England in 1907 —lie was in “The
Messenger Boy” production, among others —-
and Frank Foster, who went to London in
1912 and was introduced to concert work
there by Melba. Needham and Foster have
collaborated in short sketches, and dropped
in for a first job at the Majestic Theatre,
Melbourne. They have gone on to Sydney,
and will help in providing the interval acts
which the Union picture-shows have found
so successful as extra attractions.
“Adamascus”: “Black Out” says (B.
12/11/’25) that Eileen Sparkes lias played
a greater variety of parts than any
other actress of her age in Australia. What
about Yvonne Banvard? Yvonue has ap-
pealed in over 70 roles, varying from tragedy
to farce. When in her ’teens (she is only
22 now) she played Peg in “Peg o’ My
Heart” for over 400 consecutive performances
in Canada. Miss Banvard is an Australian,
born in Melbourne, but most of her life
has been spent in America. She was one of
Tom Pollard’s Lilliputians at the mature
age of six.
“SHnga” : An Australian song that ought
to be included in Quirindi’s programme
(B. 19/11/’25) is Miss Stephens’s setting
of “Where the Pelican Builds.” Verses
and music were the work of good Austra-
lian women, and the result is a very fine
song. I believe it was published by Paling’s
in Brisbane some years ago.
“Flaming Youth” : The average metropoli-
tan mummer no longer fries liis (or her)
sausages over an oil-stove in lodgings in
Woolioomooloo or East Melbourne; a hotel
or boarding-house is preferred if the salary
will run to it, as in most cases it will.
But saving habits remain with those who
have had most of their experience with
busli-whacking companies. Directly tin-
success of “Charley’s Aunt” convinced the
members of the Neil-Tuoliy company that
they were destined for a prolonged stay at
the Melbourne New Palace, a party of them
went in for housekeeping on a co-operative
basis, with advantage to their pockets, to say
nothing of personal comfort.- Providing for
themselves is a custom with many travelling
mummers, especially married couples. Even
when a stay in a town is only to last a
week, domestically-inclined pairs will dig out
lodgings where they can Cook the matutinal
bacon and eggs and prepare after-theatre
dishes; and they generally carry round a
special box containing what they require in
the form of cutlery, crockery and pots and
pans. People who let rooms charge extra
if they provide these utilities; and silver
thus saved helps the mummer whose salary
is still modest (even when he gets it) to
keep the wolf from the door.
A mixed Melbourne bouquet:—
The almost aboriginal simplicity of the work oi
Margaret Preston, who in combination with Thea
Proctor is holding an exhibition at the New Gal-
lery, almost stuns one at first sight; but there is
quaint art in the apparent simplicity. Sometimes
she overdoes it in this array of 42 woodcuts and
four oils, as in the imitation of a child’s drawing
of “Shell Cove, Sydney” (No. 79), and “Bridge-
street, Sydney” (No. 42) ; but there is stateliness
in “Waratahs” (No. 52), and all the other floral
studies are attractive. “Coleus” (No. 19) is a broad
statement of color fact which amongst the oils stands
out most strikingly. Thea Proctor lets phantasy play
in lines more subtle and refined, and equally as
effective, especially in her decorative treatment of
Victorian-era dresses. She exhibits half a dozen silk
fans, some fan designs, a number of water-colors, a
few- lithographs and three woodcuts; and she shows
a confidence in the reputation her work has brought
her in the prices she has marked on some of it.
A peaceful little show, giving a sense of slumbrous
happiness, is that of Mrs. H. M. Gulliver, comprising
a number of simple, unambitious representations of
the sights the artist saw and delighted in while
in England. No great heights are reached; but, then,
no great heights are attempted. It is, just a simple
exhibition of quiet scenes, with the colors nicely
blended.
There is delicate work in Fleetwood VarleyV
enamels in Robertson and Mullen’s art room. Varley's
is not the painted-on enamel; he builds up his
picture with powdered minerals upon a metal plaque
where they are caused to melt under a high
temperature; the process is repeated until, perhaps
after 15 layers, the picture, with its hard, glass-like
surface, is complete. Whole landscapes, with wonder-
ful effects of sunset or sunrise, are shown on
enamels small enough to make a lady’s brooch; in
one case, indeed, the picture is the attachment to a
ring.
Miss Annie Gates can paint flowers delightfully,
but the landscapes she shows amongst a number
of floral studies at the Athenaeum Gallery contain
painfully weak drawing and rather confused coloring.
Among the floral studies “Wild Flowers of Old
England” (No. 35), “Lilac and Clematis” (No. 55)
and “Ranunculi” (No. 39) would compensate for
many bad things. Decorative painting on china, in
which Miss Gates has done some of her best work,
is an addition to the show.

We’ve baritones I’d like to say good-bye to,
Who cannot, but (unfortunately) do.
We’ve Cockney girls who drive us almost dippy
With ditties void of melody and sense
About their coal-black mas in Mississippi—
Not yours the foul offence.
You cannot do suggestive modern dances
Derived from beastly rites in nigger huts;
No Gloria Swanson you, who skips and prances
Through Yankee films (and cannot act for nuts) ;
No Rudolph, of the silly smirk and dimple,
No Jackie Ooogan—that precocious brat.
You’re merely plain, and natural, and simple,
But none the worse for that.
Grey is your shaggy hair, and getting greyer,
But well you play your unpretentious part:
l hold you, donk., a damsite better player
Than lots of those who brag about their “art.”
Serene you somehow keep, while all around you
Are noisy, nervy, too self-conscious folk:
Placid and restful I have always found you,
So welcome back, old moke!

This is an age of progress.
Men and women are no
longer content to just
manage” with makeshifts.
Everyone wants the conveni-
ence of Electric Light, and
rightly so. In the country
areas, electric light alone
means a wonderfully im-
proved standard of living.
But when }'ou consider the
multiplicity of odd jobs that
can be done in the home
and on the farm with the aid
of electric power, a Westing-
house becomes more than de-
sirable —it becomes a neces-
sity. It will provide power
for pumping, milking, separ-
ating, grinding, sweeping,
washing, ironing, and the
sewing-machine, as well as
many other tasks. It will
provide power to operate a
water-pressure system, and
the means of fighting fire. It
will run electric fans and the
Kelvinator. In short, it will
nw
m
in,
m
in
in
w
make life easier, better and
brighter, and it is so econo
mical too.
The wonderful guaran-
tees, too, are worth looking into, they
protect you so fully.
You tell us what sort of work a plant
could do for you, and we will tell you
the type, size and price of the plant
you need, as well as how you can pa>
for it while you use it. Write for the
Westinghouse booklet, it is really inter-
esting and will not obligate you in any
way.

THIS FREE BOOK
“The Magic Carpet ”
is the name of this
hook, and it tells all
about Meccano. It
shows illustrations of
all the Meccano Out-
fits, from No. 00 at 5/-
upwards, and tells
how the addition of
each new part makes
it possible to build
several more models.
Get your boy in-

NOW. Ask him to
write for this free
book without delay. A
postcard to E. G. Page

MECCANO never grows old, Meccano is a
thousand toys in one. . . . Now a truck, to-
morrow a pair of scales, next a lathe, or a loom,
or a revolving crane! Meccano makes all these
things and hundreds more.
Meccano will give your boy a new interest in
life—train his eye and hand and brain—make
him think and act for himself. He will get to
know all about engineering, electricity, motors,
aeroplanes, mining, weaving, transport—all good
sound general knowledge that will help to shape
his career and stand him in good stead, maybe, in
years to come.
You can buy Meccano Outfits at most toy-
shops at all prices from 5/-. Don’t buy more toys
that your boy is sure to get tired of. Give him

fTTHE Bissell sweeper makes a wel-
\|>/ come gift to wife, mother or
bride, to any busy woman, in fact,
who likes to keep her carpets clean
and yet have a little time and strength
left for the things she would like to do.
Only Bissell Carpet Sweepers have
“Cyco” ball bearings, a set for every
wheel where they do the most good,
ensuring better sweeping, easier run-
ning, longer life. A Bissell is easy to
handle and always ready for instant
use. It sweeps thoroughly without
tiring back or hands, pays for itself
many times over in cost of brooms and
lasts ten to fifteen years—many longer.
No matter what other cleaning de-
vice is in the home, a Bissell is a real
everyday necessity and comfort, and
every housewife will appreciate one.
Little Bissells for little girls at trifling cost
make happy gifts and happy children. Sold
by leading merchants everywhere. Write for

THE world well knows that
it takes more sportsman-

Duofold than any ordinary pen,
or any other gift below 35 /-.
But what is more important
is that you could send any one
of a hundred higher-priced gifts
and not inspire half the eager
welcome that will greet this
coveted pen.
In home after home, its gay
Christmas colour will flash the
glad tidings to expectant hearts.
A colour that is as attractive as

Henry M.: Yes, but what are you going to
do about it ? The last par has an idea; but very
few would get that far Terminal: Poor doggerel,
lame in all its feet P.G.L.: As dull as the eye
of last week’s cod. W.P.D.: The matter is there;
but you choke it with words. Remember, this paper
has to cover a continent every week... .E.J.H.:
Already handled.... Egilbo: Plods wearily along an
old track. .. .Ancient M.: But that writer didn’t even
suggest that Phillip should “have the credit of
discovery.” What he insisted upon was that Phillip
“planted the flag” in Australia Macklen: “Thurla”
is good enough to tell us that when the sth Div.
was being organised, the Bth, 14th and 15th brigades
were transferred from Tel-el-Kebir to Moascar. The
Bth went by rail and the 15th by the desert road-
way; the 14th did it ’cross-country—with results
that did no good to General Irving ... .M.E.E.: Quite
printable; but so much is submitted for the Red
Page that many printable things have to be sacrificed.
....10618: The man who crowds his typewritten
lines so close together simply begs to be shot into
the w.p.b James T.: Thanks; will put by for
use on a favorable occasion... .N.K.G.: “Bride’s
Trousseau Nightie” regretfully declined G. 5.0.: It’s
some distance off, but there is originality there. You
haven’t quite enough skill to express your ideas
yet. But keep going R.S.E.: Doesn’t make us
tingle. .. .F.G.H.: In the right direction; but some
of the lines are weak... .D.P.M.: All suggest some-
thing; none of them get there. It is the art of
taking more trouble that you need R.C. (Lind-
field) : The “Bird” is too frail; the other, though
very slight, nearly did it Charlotte P.: Can’t find
any point in it nor any spark of interest... .M. 5.8.:
Don’t care for it P.H.C.: The verse is better than
the yarn you tell Spadger: Not up R.F.C.:
The mere arrangement of rhymes won’t make a
sonnet. There is none of the sonnet movement; and
the matter is very slight B2R: Lame and clumsy.
... .L.N. (Aldgate) : They miss J.R.L.: The
rhythmic flow and lilting charm lift the theme far
above mere polities:—
This “White Australia” does not seem quite fair,
To stand up and to Japs and Chows declare:
“We won’t have you in this fair land of ours,”
At which the banned one in secret silence glowers.
We pushed our way in China and Japan,
With such discretion which our zeal outran ;
And yet we bar them wholly from our land,
Nor heed their protest made on every hand.
Australia badly needs a population,
Of races white, all in a just equation;
We millions of such people do require,
Men who can work in heat and never tire.
. ...C.J.F.: There is a great deal too much of
“Anastasia”; and some parts of it are a good deal
better than others.... F.A.W.: Spoiled in the telling,
particularly in the high moral tone of the finish
J.M. (St. Kilda) : Not for us. Should be appreciated
elsewhere.... L.M. (Melb.) : Not very interesting and
it doesn’t read true.... Basil L.: Both miss
Valbee: Some distance off the target Shandy
Sandy: Thin, poor stuff Non Habile: So badly
written that it doesn’t make its meaning clear.
... .Midas: “Spell” doesn’t work. ... J.A.P.: Very
tedioys yarn A.D. (South Yarra) : Moves heavily
and gets to nothing worth while.. . .Ripponlea: The
end leaves us a little puzzled as to the fate of the
cat’s-meat man, but there is no mistaking the lofty
moral intent of the blacksmith:—
“Shut yer hullaballoo,” the brutal son-in-law roared
As the blind old man by the fireplace snored;
The callous daughter merely did sneakily sneer,
Keeping her mouth shut and drinking her beer.
One beautiful, blue-eyed babe sucked a piece of soap
Whilst another ’neath the table did grubbilv grope.
Intense hate in the young man’s breast did swell •
“Get ter Hell outer here, ’y old mongrel,” he did yell.
Sobbing poignantly, the aged blindman faced the dark
As on his hoary head his batter'd hat did he park,
His expression showing plainly that he was very hurt;
But he cried “I forgive them both, although they’ve
Done me Dirt.”
The cruel cliffs were near; that deadly Bluff
Where the grass was high and the ground terribly
rough.
He’d lost his way! Which way would he go ?
He heard the waves dash o’er the rocks an hundred
feet below.
... .Sibby: You’re a dismal beggar E.R. (East
Adelaide) : You are entitled to your opinion, of
course, but when you tell us how that pafcer has
won its circulation you make us smile C.M.L.:
Not the goods for this market David W.: All too
vague and unreal... .E.K.R.: Doesn’t move u 5....
R.W.W.: The sketch goes a bit thin in the middle.
S.R.D.: Rotten sort of yarn 8.K.N.: Too
mechanical A.R.8.: Can’t find a use for it

Messrs. ARMSTRONG-HOLLAND, 4 Bridge St., Sydney, N.S.W.
SEND FOR OUR ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE No. 20.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Keppel”: From gum-leaves may be
obtaiued geraniol, the basis of a great num-
ber of perfumes. A Brisbane co. has 20
hands working in the Gladstone (C.Q.) dis-
trict getting it. The trees —spotted gums—
are stripped of their leaves, and the essen-
tial oil, extracted by a steaming process, is
sent to England and the Continent, where
it i.s converted into geraniol. The industry
is new, but promises to be profitable.
“Stellsby” : The barque James Craig, last
of the Craig timber clippers that traded for
many years between Maoriland and the Com-
monwealth, is due for conversion into a hulk,
dones and Co., the Tassy jam firm, were her
latest owners, but for the last two years the
hooker lias been laid up in Hobart owing
to the difficulty experienced in finding a crew
to man her permanently. A mummified
sailorman wall soon be an exhibit in our
museums.
“Coppertop”: When we arrived at Char-
leroi, Belgium, in 1918, cigarettes were
only purchasable at the army canteens,
four packets (of-a kind) for a franc. Few
of the Belgians in the city had burned
tobacco of any kind since Fritz captured
their town in 1914, and townsfolk would
hang round the canteens offering as much as
a franc (value at that time lOd.) for a
single fag. I remember but one Digger who
took the franc, and lie did it only once.
That sort of profiteering was reckoned over
the odds in the A.I.F.
* * * *
“Huffin-Guffin”: The quality of the
material used in Australian soldiers’ uni-
forms must have been first-class. Ex-
Diggers may still be seen doing rough work
in their old tunics, puttees, etc. Why can’t
we have as good material in our civvy work-
ing clothes? During the seven years since
the war ended, the average working-man has
probably worn out two or three suits, yet
the khaki is still going strong. Footwear is
much the same. A pair of military boots
would outlast two or three ordinary pairs.
What can w 7 e do about it?
* * * *
“Kriz”: Shell-openers and lugger crews
will have their Christmas duff at sea this
year if the scheme submitted by the West-
ralian Pearlers’ Association is adopted by
boat-owners in the pearl fisheries out of
Broome. The annual lay-up of the fleet has
commenced in December; the idea now is
to carry on till the end of January. It is a
wonder the scheme did not come into opera-
tion years ago, for December and January
are ideal working months. Each year has
seen the boats laid up in the Christmas
month and put to sea again about the
middle of February, when much valuable
working time is lost by the boats running
into shelter from the baby willy-willy. For
years the Pearlers’ Association has been
waiting a favorable time to launch the
new scheme. It has picked the right one, for
this year most pearlers are very much behind
in their year’s take of shell.
“Uramao” : The Ross Sea whaling expedi-
tion has started off from Maoriland for its
third roun<J with the whales in the frozen
South. The first expedition did not pay exes.,
but last year the party bagged sufficient
whales to yield 32,000 casks of oil. It takes
25,000 casks to make such an expedition pay,
and it is hoped to better last year's record
on this occasion. Aboard the mother-ship,
the Sir James Clarke Ross, was Mr. Wiig,
Norwegian Consular agent in Southland, who
went back to his motherland in the same
ship last March, after an absence of 36 years.
He was in Oslo when Amundsen arrived
from his famous flight in the Arctic, and was
one of the first to greet him. Strange to say,
Mr. Wiig in 1910 wms the first Nor-
wegian to greet Amundsen on his re-
turn from the South Pole after narrowly
beating the ill-fated Captain Scott to it.
* * * *
“Gregor” : The bulk of the opium which
comes to Australia is not smuggled in by
haphazard methods (B. 12/11/’25). Some
recent disclosures before the Narcotics Com-
mittee of the League of Nations suggest that
most of the world’s illicit traffic in the drug
is controlled by an organisation which has
its headquarters in Macao, the Portuguese
colony in China. Agents in India and China
buy up supplies of the drug, which is shipped
to places whence it is easily smuggled into
the countries which have banned it. The
opium for America, where the largest and
most profitable market exists, is exported
direct to Mexico,, and soon finds its way over
the frontier. That for Australia is sent to
Shanghai,* and there placed on board vessels
sailing for Commonwealth ports, to be un-
loaded at those which are least vigilantly
guarded. It is estimated that the organisa-
tion handles something like 2,000,000 tins
of opium a year.
* * * *
“Caveman” : Even old salts who have kept
in touch with ships and sailor men scarcely
realise how few windjammers are afloat
flying the red ensign. Lloyd’s register gives
the number of such British vessels still at
work as six—Garthpool, Garthneil. Monk
barns, Rewa, Ivilmallie and William Mitchell.
The Garthpool is a four-masted barque, the
others are three masted. The Rewa is laid
up, the Garthpool and Monkbarns have
loaded nitrates at Callao for Europe, the
others are on their way from England to
Australia. They are all over 30 years old,
but of course built of steel, and to that
extent modern. There are no true old
windjammers left under the red ensign—
except the Cutty Sark —and it is scarcely
likely that any more will be built in Britain.
Scandinavian and Finnish merchants have
bought most of the sailing ships, and have
even supplemented them with new ones like
the Kjobnhavn. German submarines sank a
fair number, and others have been scrapped
outright as hopelessly unprofitable. Perhaps
the cessation of the coal trade between
(Australia and South America settled them
finally. With the passing of the lime-juicers
the supply of real sailor men will cease —and
the ghosts of Clarke Russell and Frank
Bullen will wring their hands in contem-
plation of the “salt-water laborers” /of to-
day who don’t know a ship from a bar of
soap.

THE ENGINE-.
The Engine is an important part of the plant because it is required to give a steady l reliable
flow of power all the time. Ao
The Lister British-built Engine used on all plants has long been well known
as one of the most reliable, simple and efficient small Engines in the world.
The highly-sensitive Centrifugal Governor assures very steady running an important
factor in a lighting plant.
The Automatic Lubrication does away with constant attention to the Engine.
The cost of fuel is very low—and repairs are rarely necessary, making the running most
economical.
THE GENERATOR.
The Lister Generator is specially designed for the battery-charging work, and like every
part of the Plant it is 'fool-proof.” It complies with the English Standards Committee
Specifications, which gives it a very high rating in the Electrical World.
THE STORAGE BATTERY.
Every Plant is fitted with a high-grade British-made Battery, giving larger capacity and more
power than foreign batteries supplied with so many other Plants.
*Jt&erJsYe) Batteries give the absolute capacity required, and are rated truthfully. They
are the highest quality obtainable.

“Ditto” : Melbourne is to have its Bondi—
Clapp’s new bayside station between Carrum
and Chelsea. Aren’t we an original people?
“Yeria” : What remains of the Emden on
Keeling Island is not worth talking about.
Practically only two battered boilers are
lying on the barrier. Sydney Clunies-Ross,
the owner of the group, salvaged all he could,
and the heavy monsoon seas soon finished
the rest, pounding it to pieces.
The Rhodes Scholarship in Victoria this
year goes to the ex-Scotch Collegian G. W.
Paton, who, after entering Ormond in 1921,
captured a quiverful of scholarships as well
as his B.A. degree. Sound bellows and a
fleet pair of heels are his sporting assets,
which won him the inter-’Varsity mile cham-
pionship. He is 23.
R. N. McCulloch, the Ma State’s 1926
Rhodes scholar, is the son of a N. S. Wales
grazier, and has taken up bugs and the
composition of the soil for his 'fine of!
study. He was turned out on the Fort-
street High School lathe. On the sports
side he is an oarsman, and will stroke the
Sydney ’Varsity eight this year.
“Alwyn”: Allan Cunningham’s grave in
the Sydney Botanic Gardens is a reminder
of the industry of the late J. 11. Maiden.
When the old Devonshire-street cemetery
was abandoned, the veteran ex-director re-
ceived permission to transfer the explorer’s
remains to their present resting-place ; they
were placed in a leaden box and inserted in
the obelisk which is familiar to every fre-
quenter of the gardens. At the same time
Maiden secured Cunningham’s tombstone,
which is now clamped to the seedroom wall.
A great prophet is the talkative Meredith
Atkinson, professor or thereabouts. The
Nineteenth Century, the big English
monthly, was ill-informed enough to lately
print (August) an article of his; and its
quality can be judged from this: “The
[.Labor] party is only just, emerging into re-
newed favor. The cumulative ineptitudes of
the Nationalist-Country party coalitions are
to a large extent responsible for the swing
of the pendulum.” As a judge of pendulum-
swings Atkinson must surely be about! the
world’s worst.
“Pernoos”: General Allenby. who comes
this way shortly, missed one of the countings-
out designed for hirq by the Diggers in Egypt.
It was after the affair with the local Gyppo,
when a disciplined crowd of indignant Anzacs
burned down a native village in retaliation
for the murder of one of their number, action
on the part of the authorities in the matter
having been sluggish. The brigade concerned
having been drawn up in hollow square, a
cloud of dust was seen approaching rapidly
which materialised into Allenby and his staff.
Galloping with furious haste into the middle
of the square, the General raised himself in
his stirrups and delivered this brief oration :
“Australians, I was once proud of you. I
am proud of you no longer!” Before the
first astounded Digger had started his “One,
two, three,” the brass-liatted whirlwind had
disappeared over the skyline.
“Ex-Dig.”: Lieut. Bob Humphries, of the
Ist Divvy, wdio was one of “the origi-
nals,” surely wins this competition for
long war service without a break. He never
had a day’s leave from his battalion, the
nearest approach to it being his attendance
at an officers’ school for three months to
qualify for his commission; but the school
was in France, and in none of its show
places either. He was in charge of No. 8
platoon of the Ist Battalion when it was
all but wiped out by a single shell near
Strazeele, in April, 1918, by which time his
service had exceeded years. Humphries
said to me a couple of months before his
death that he had “come through without a
scratch, but I suppose when I get it it will
be a full issue.” It was, but one that left
no mai’k —concussion from the shell explo-
sion killed him, while most of the other 18
were shockingly mutilated.
In one of his “Barchester Towers” novels
Anthony Trollope drew a lady, an English
cleric’s daughter, married to an Italian
nobleman, who sought to impress on Bishop
Proudie, at the Bishop’s party, that her little
daughter was “the last of the Neros.” And
here in Australia, apparently, we have a new
arrival whose lineage goes back to the Doges
of Venice, the gorgeous persons who used to
throw rings into the Adriatic as a symbol
cf the maritime supremacy of their republic.
This is from the West Australian’s birth
notices: —
MARQUIS BONANATE. —On November 5, at
Nurse Read’s (late Nurse Lloyd’s) Private Hospital,
to the Marquis and Marquise Bonanate, descendant of
his Royal Highness the Marquis Bonanate, Prince
d’Acaia, Duke of Piacenza and Doge of Venice,
illustrious family dating from a.d. 1377 —a daughter
(Princess Joan Helena Margeurite de Saint Elia).
Fifth child. London, New York, Paris, Rome and
Melbourne papers please copy.
A fairly comprehensive order, the last. One
wonders, while they were about it, why the
proud parents didn’t throw in Venice as
well; it wouldn’t have cost any more.
“S.T.S.”: Someone who was at Rugby
with Austen Chamberlain has been telling
The Bulletin that though “studious and
even then something of a debater” he was
never suspected of being “likely to develop
into one of Britain’s foremost statesmen”
(B. 29/10/’25). Moving on from Rugby to
Cambridge, however, Austen plunged at once
into a strong political atmosphere in the
Union, a club which combines the usual com-
forts with semi-public weekly debates on all
the questions of the day. Those were the
years just before Gladstone split the lib-
eral party up by declaring for Home Rule,
and the G.O.M. was driving a restive Liberal
Ministry in which he had somehow to make
the aristocratic Hartington and Harcourt
run with the (very nearly, at that period)
republican Joseph Chamberlain and Dilke;
and undergraduate feeling ran very high.
Even at that date Austen showed remark-
able powers as a debater. It was notable
that on any straight party question the
undergraduate eloquence was mostly on the
Liberal side but the solid voting on the Con-
servative. I believe that on account of the
prejudices of the majority Chamberlain was
never allowed the much-prized short term as
President of the Union, considered due to
each prominent debater. But we who spoke
and voted with him never felt any doubt
that he was destined to be a future leader
ifi the House of Commons.

WITH its enormous resources,
Studebaker has built and equip-
ped great plants in which it makes
every vital part of its cars engines,
bodies, clutches, steering gears, differen-
tials, gear boxes, springs, axles, gray iron
castings, and drop forgings. By building
these parts in its own plants, it eliminates
the profits of outside parts and body
makers.
One-profit manufacture not only effects
savings which allow Studebaker to use
better materials and workmanship, but
it ensures perfect .co-ordination of units.
For every Studebaker part is designed
and produced under the supervision of
Studebaker engineers.
Only Ford in the low priced field and
Studebaker in the fine car field produce
cars on a one-profit basis.
Studebaker “One-Profit” cars offer more
m value, performance and endurance be-
cause of the conditions under which they
are manufactured and the high quality of
materials and workmanship they contain.
Hundreds of Studebakers, that have been
driven upward of 100,000 miles, prove
that one-profit manufacture makes for
greater endurance and stamina. One-
profit Studebakers are breaking in when
others are breaking up.

There' is nothing more beautiful than a perfect skin, clear, soft and health} that is

oily, or of coarse texture, the trouble can be easily remedied by using Rexona Soap.
Rexona Soap is the ready aid to those in search of a beautiful skin.
Soap once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe aid
Simply use Rexona
cleanse the pores,
remove the tendency to blotches,
sallowness, oiliness and coarse-
ness, and leave the complexion
clear, fresh and velvety.
No matter how particular you
may be, Rexona Soap is sure to
satisfy you, for it is the aristocrat
of soaps, pure and free from dry
chemicals, being medicated on the
same principle as the famous
Rexona Ointment, which is famous
throughout Australasia as the
Rapid Healer.

g T~ PON a bold peninsula
II Of basalt built and veined with jarle
There stood an ancient Maori pa;
And, daily, ditch and palisade
Reflected lay in Roroma.
There was not a more peaceful place
In all the realm of Maoriland;
The only riot eye could trace
Through seasons in their saraband
Was Nature’s wantoning with grace.
The wafted wind upon the cheek
Was smooth as moth-spun gossamer;
The koromiko by the creek
Made all there was of sound or stir,
Bending to hear the ripples speak.
The turquoise waters lay beneath;
And etched upon them there outspread,
Thrust through the snow’s bedazzling sheath
To morning marching overhead,
Defiant mountains showed their teeth.
One wooded rampart range afar
Upon the west kept guard in gloom,
Across its brow an umber scar;
And like a lamp hung o’er a tomb
Above it gleamed the evening star.
There had deep peace so camped about
And ringed the palisaded pa
None ever held her reign in doubt.
The women sang their waiata
And tossed the poi balls about.
Therein, with ardor naught could tire,
A youthful priest his work pursued.
Slow dreams that in his brain took fire
He carved into red rimu wood,
And with them love and life’s desire.
He carved the tribal Arch of Life
And guardian ghosts both fierce and rude,
With primal passions all at strife.
Great strength and freedom in the nude
And Earth and Heaven man and wife.
With craft he wrought each whorl and mark,
Orbed eyes of pearl-shell fain to see;
Cut from the mine long sealed by bark
The jointed engine of the knee
And corded torso strong and stark.
He limned thd whole diurnal round,
The ascending stars, the day’s descent,
A power two-faced, crowned and uncrowned,
Alternate in the firmament,
Yet in eternal union bound.
Brave pagan, constant to your theme,
Romance that ever keeps alive
The saving vision and the dream —
Two great high priests the soul to shrive —
You make the past the kindlier seem!
And oft, as on the west there lies
A sunburst spun from cloth of gold
To flag the day that onward flies.
The eyes of shell round which you scrolled
Answer the glories of the skies!
DARIUS.
MACRILAND.
Toongabbie Molly.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“ OU are,” said the Rev. Samuel
| Marsden, Senior Chaplain of the
Colony, as he stood in the yard of the
Factory at Parramatta, “a thorough bad lot.
There is nought, my lass, I think ye’d hesi-
tate to do. There is no good in you. Why
this man should want to marry you passeth
my comprehension. You’re a thief, you're a
prostitute, you’re a drunkard. Look ye, Tom
Mollison —d’ye know what you’re about? If
ever a man was a-going out to grasp trouble
with both hands, I think you’re that man,
a-standing here beside me. This girl hath a
record would make a she-devil blush—in the
ship coming hither to the colony, here in the
Factory and at whatever place she hath been
assigned to in service. ’Tis ever the same,
whithersoever she goeth. ’Tis your affair, of
course, but I would strongly counsel ye,
Tom Mollison, to look elsewhere for a wife.
There are other women here. There are
none worse than this red-headed creature,
I’ll be bound.”
The tall, loosely-built fellow standing be-
side Mr. Marsden regarded the girl before
them with interest. She was red-haired,
freckled and squinted, but she had certain
good looks, and her figure, even in the clumsy
dress of a female prisoner, did not lack
symmetry and the grace of health and
strength. She was grinning at the Chaplain’s
characterisation of her for the benefit of the
man who wished to marry her. But her grin
turned to a smirk when she looked her
suitor in the face. She had no intention of
offending or discouraging him.
“If ’ee plaize, Muster Marsden, for why
do ’ee make me out such a bad un? I ain’t
niver done you no ’arm. I’m a good gal.
compared to some of ’em. For why do ’ee
spake so unkind of me?”
“My lass, I know ye. I have watched ye.
Many of your doings I am well acquainted
with. Who was it stirred up all the trouble
in this place a twelve-month ago? Who was
it led the riot amongst the women at the
Coal River the time the Commandant's
windows were smashed? Who did they
prove in court to have admitted the sailors
to the women’s quarters on the transport
Edgecombe during her voyage to New South
Wales in ’l5? Who threw Mistress Sprack-
ley, the gaoler’s wife at Windsor, into South
Creek when she was in that good woman’s
service? Who hath absented herself from
the Factory here, and been found, dressed as
a man, in the Stockade at. Castle Hill?
Whom have I myself punished in the stocks
for drunkenness? Why. who but you,
Molly Livermore, ye shameless and aban-
doned hussy. I know ye. I know ye too
well.”
“Ah, y'r rev’rence, mebbe having a home
of her own, as I’m prepared to give her on
my farm at Toongabbie, will qui’ten her
down. I’m sure she’s not such a bad lass at
heart. Give her the chance, an’ she may
make a good wife to a settler like meself.”
"Iss. Muster Marsden —give I a charnce,”
said the woman. “What charnce have I iver
had —me an’ others like me, here in Noo Sou’
Wales? Give I my charnce. Thomas, I do
thankee for axin’ for me. I’ll make ’ee a
praper wife—l do zwear it to ’ee.”
Mr. Marsden lifted his hands in a gesture
that was meant to imply that lie, at any rate,
was no party to this bad bargain. Tom
Mollison might do as he pleased. The
Church had tried to avert this calamity from
him, but he would have it. Well, let him
abide by it.
“Well, well, be it so. Come wi’ me to
the church, and I’ll marry ye this instant.
Go there now, and await me—l must sign
Molly Livermore’s discharge from this place.
Wait for me at the church, while I see to it.
Take her, Tom Mollison —and d —n ye for a
stupid fool. But I wish ye good luck with
her. By heavens, ye’ll need it! Be at the
church in an hour’s time. There’s some-
thing I’ve forgotten.”
lie strode away to the Superintendent’s
office, while the happy couple departed, arm
in arm, through the porter's lodge.
“Tommy,” said the lady, “to tli’ Pig an’
Whistle. I think we’ll wet it. Did iver ye
hear th’ like? The old divvle! I'd like fine
for to scratch his eyes out.”
There are not a few entirely worthy and
respectable people in Australia at this pre-
sent moment who, if they cared to do so,
might trace their genealogical tree back to
such a match as this. It is astonishing how
well such unions often turned out. A sober
and industrious prisoner, transported, fre-
quently enough, for some trivial offence that
would to-day entail upon him “the rising of
the court” or a fine of a few shillings, would
discover himself in possession of a ticket-
of-leave or even a conditional pardon after
a few years of penal servitude or of assign-
ment to service. He might have a little
money saved, the result of laborious en-
deavors during the few hours out of each day
which he might call his own. It was usual
for Government —especially during Mac-
quarie’s time —to make a grant of a few
acres of land to such a man, upon his earn-
ing the right to call all his time his own.
And then, having a home, however rough and
primitive it might be, he would need a wife.
Where could he get her? There was no-
where to turn but to the Factory at Parra-
matta. , So he would make application there,
and, if his character was satisfactory, the
Factory’s stock-in-trade in the item of wives
would be displayed for his inspection. The
queer assortment of femininity within its
walls would be paraded before him in the
yard. There, in company with the Superin-
tendent —or often in that of the Rev. Samuel
Marsden, who delighted in promoting the
cause of morality in a community that was
for the most part frankly immoral —he would
make his choice. The lady, blushing or
brazen, would be called out of the ranks
—to the accompaniment of laughing and
muttered obscenity on the part of her com-
panions—and questioned as to her willing-
ness for matrimony. She might make such
inquiries as she pleased of her prospective
partner concerning his position and pros-
pects. Most loftcn an immediate agreement
would be arrived at. Then they would go off
together to get married, and. almost inevit-
ably, drunk. Not a few brief honeymoons
were spent in the stocks in George-strect, to
the edification of the inhabitants of Parra-
matta, the delicacy of whose wit would have
full scope upon these happy occasions. Yet
strangely often these curious marriages were
the foundations of happy lives and of fami-
lies that have brought nothing but credit
and honor upon the country of their nativity.
Mr. and Mrs. Mollison were already fairly
well elevated by the time they reached the
church of St. John —the twin towers of
which still rear themselves aloft in Parra-
matta —and were not unduly depressed by
the homily extended to them by Mr. Mars-
den at the close of the wedding ceremony.
“And remember this, Tom Mollison,” he
boomed at them as he concluded. “Remem-
ber the old rhyme that saith
A woman, a dog and a chestnut-tree,
The better ye beat ’em the better they be.
And as for you, Molly Mollison, you mind
yourself. I’ll have my eye on ye. Yes, by
George, I will!”
* * * *
The morning was bright and clear when,
six months after the above line of asterisks
came into this truthful story, the Rev.
Samuel Marsden jogged out towards Pros-
pect Hill upon the stout bay cob that car-
ried him about his parish. The tall white-
and blue-gum trees reared their tufted crests
against a clear blue sky, and the wattle of
the undergrowth was yellow in its spring
clothing and made the morning fragrant
with its aromatic scent, as he rode through
the bush where the western highway to Emu
Ford and the new settlement at Bathurst
Plains across the blue wall of the mountains
in front of him passes through the district
of Toongabbie. Magpies carolled and
butcher-birds sang gaily, and the Senior
Chaplain was himself moved to a hymn of
praise. The sturdy son of Yorkshire was
always happiest and best tempered when
his duties took him into the open air be-
neath the blue dome of Heaven —whether
it might be along the banks of the Hawkes-
bury, out to the northward of Castle Hill,
amongst the farms and orchards, or far off
across the seas in his missionary enterprises
among the Maoris.
Here and there little square whitewashed
cottages, with bark or shingle roofs, stood
in front of clearings that had been ploughed
and cultivated, and were already showing
a green tinge on the red or chocolate carpet

SELDOM a day passes without an
accident in the household. The
mother cooking and preparing meals
meets with cuts, scrapes and scratches;
ironing brings its burns, and cleaning

their little limbs and faces.
That’s why no household can afford to
be without Zam-Buk, as a box of this
healer comprises a compact, reliable
little surgery for a hundred emergencies.

scratches with this powerful antiseptic

healing with clear, healthy skin. Buy a
box of Zam-Buk to-day and keep it handy

fences sometimes surrounded the cultivation
paddocks—sometimes they only had for
boundaries the tall trunks of the trees, and
the dense scrub of wattle and ti-tree that
grew between them.
“Somewhere hereabouts should be Molli-
son’s,” murmured the Chaplain to himself
as he paused by one of these primitive homes,
in front of which a group of children played
in the sunlight about a little muddy pond.
“Hi, there!” he bellowed. “Come over
here, one of ye. I w T ant to ask ye some-
thing.”
A flaxen-haired boy with blue, laughing
eyes, and hatless and shoeless, ran out into
the road.
“Yairs, mister?” he said in the quaint
drawl that was already the characteristic
manner of speech of the native-born.
Mr. Marsden looked down with satisfac-
tion at the sturdy lad, who was probably, he
thought, about ten years old —though taller
and better developed than an English boy
of sixteen would have been. “A good land
for the children!” he muttered to himself.
Then aloud: “See here, my son, d'ye know
where Tom Mollison’s place is?”
“Tom Mollison, Mister?” the boy drawled
in the cautious fashion of young Australia
when it feels that it is necessary to gain a
little time in which to take stock of the
stranger. “Tom Mollison?”
“Yes. Does he not dwell somewhere about
here? You know his place, don’t you?”
The boy stared up unwinkingly at the
burly clergyman.
“You’re Mister Marsden, ain’t ye, sir—
from Par’matta?”
“Yes, yes—l’m Mr. Marsden. And I want
Tom Mollison. Show me where he lives and
there’ll be a penny for ye.”
“Oh, that’ll be Toongabbie Molly’s man?”
“Toongabbie Molly! And, pray, who’s
she ?”
“Aw, ev’ryone knows Toongabbie Molly,
Mister. She’s a holy terror, she is. She’s
Tom Mollison’s missus. A holy terror.” He
grinned and winked as he spake his criticism
of Mrs. Mollison in slow deliberateness.
“A terror, is she—a holy terror? H’m!
Where’s her house, then?”
“ ’Tis the first on th’ left-hand side after
ye pass th’ nex’ bend in the road, y’r honor,”
said the boy. “Ye’ll see Tom Mollison a-
workin’ in th’ paddick. A thin cove.
Thank ye, sir”—diving into the dust as the
chaplain dropped the promised penny to the
ground.
“Thank you, my son,” said Mr. Marsden
as he rode off. “‘A holy terror,’ eh! We’ll
see into this —yes, we’ll see into this,” he
muttered as he tapped the stout cob with his
riding-crop. “We’ll see into this!”
Round the next turn in the road he came
upon the little house. Leaning on the top-
rail of a rough dog-leg fence, his fists
clenched upon either side of his head over
his ears, Avas Tom Mollison, dejection and
despair in every sagging line of his limp atti-
tude. His eyes were turned towards the
ground, and he did not perceive Mr. Mars-
den’s approach, neither did he hear his
hearty greeting, by reason of the blocking
of his ears. As soon as he halted the Chap-
lain was able to account for Tom’s atti-
tude, and why he blocked his hearing with
his hands.
From inside the little slab hut, whose
door stood wide open, came a discordant
chorus of curses in a woman’s voice.
“Ye ugly , ye! I’ll learn ye to
talk to me!. I’ll —* — well teach ye zummat,
ye herrin’-gutted make-believe o’ a man ! I’ll
chase ye from here to Par’matta, if zo be
ye dares to say another word ag’iu me. Ye
white-livered rat, ye!”
“ Silence, there!” roared the chaplain, in
such a bellow that even Tom Mollison heard
him, and lifted his gaze from the ground to
stare in a startled fashion at Mr. Marsden.
lie touched his ragged cabbage-tree hat witli
his forefinger, and smiled feebly as he looked
up. The noise in the house ceased suddenly.
“Mr. Marsden, sir! I hope I see y’r honor
in good health.”
“ ’Tis more than you look to be in, Tom
Mollison. What’s all this racket? Wliat’s
all this cursing and blaspheming and taking
of the Lord’s name in vain that I hear
coming out of your house? What’s the
matter with you, mail —are you ill? Who’s
that inside making such a damnable pother?”
“ ’Tis Molly, sir,” the unhappy-looking
man answered dejectedly.
“Molly! Your wife, you mean?”
“Aye, Mr. Marsden —’tis her.”
Mr. Marsden dismounted and hitched
his bridle over one of the dog-legs of the
fence. He scrambled through it and stood
beside the sorrowful and afflicted Mollison.
He clapped him on the shoulder.
“Tom, my poor lad, I’m sorry for ye, for
I know ’tis bitterness is come to be your
portion. Come now, tell me how she hath
behaved herself since I married ye in St.
John’s six months gone. How has she con-
ducted herself? Tell me now.”
Tom Mollison glanced fearfully at the
door of the hut and lowered his voice as he
replied.
“Like a she-devil, sir. She’s all y’r honor
said she was—an’ more beside. She drinks
an’ she curses me all the time. All th’ time
—marnin’, noon an’ night. That ain’t no-
thing what y’r honor heard then. She’s a
devil out o’ Hell—axin’ y’r honor’s pardon.
Y’r honor said she was—an’ y’r honor put
it mild.”
“How doth she work? Maybe her deeds
atone for her rough words.”
“Work! She’ll do no hand’s turn, y’r
honor—nayther cookin’ nor bakin’ nor keep-
in’ th’ place neat. Times I feel like takin’
to th’ bush an’ makin’ a peaceful life of it
wi’ th’ bushrangers. Ye’ve no idea, y'r
honor. Ye’ve no idea !”
Mr. Marsden frowned as he walked to-
wards the door of the hut.
“Come out here, you Toongabbie Molly!”
lie roared. “Come out here. I desire a
word or two with you. Come out here.”
Mrs. Mollison came into the doorway
glancing disdainfully at her husband. She
curtseyed sulkily to the chaplain, of whom,
like most people in the Territory, she stood
a little in awe.
“Come out here” he commanded.
She advanced a couple of steps closer to
him.
And then Toongabbie Molly reached a
turning-point in her career.
With a bellow like an angry bull and aston-
ishing agility in view of his heavy build, the
Chaplain leaped towards her, seized her by the
collar of her jacket, twisted her round and
began to belabor her behind with his riding-
crop.
“There—and there —and there !” he roared
pantingly. “That’ll teach ye to behave your-
self ! That’ll teach ye how to treat a decent
man, ye trollop! That’ll do ye good, ye
blaspheming harlot! That’ll instil decency
into ye, ye cat! That —and that —and
that !”
He flogged her till she screamed for mercy,
and then he pushedfher away from him. She
staggered against the wall of the little dwell-
ing and cowered there in terror.
Mr. Marsden shook his fist at her. He
was blown with his exertions. '
“Puff,” he said—“puff, puff ! Let that—
puff—be a lesson to ye, my woman. See
that ye mend your ways—puff—or by the
blessing of Providence I’ll—puff—come out
here and give ye another taste of it! Let
me hear a good report of ye, my lass —a
good report—or ye’ll fare twice as badly
when next I do encounter ye!”
He got through the fence and unhitched
his horse.
“Tom,” he whispered, “see that ye keep
her up to it. Remember the old rhyme.”
The Senior Chaplain of New South Wales
mounted his horse and rode away to Pros-
pect.
“Get inside, d —n ye!” said Tom Mollison.
Abjectly, Toongabbie Molly obeyed him.
* * * *
Christmas Day was very hot, and in the
afternoon, having dined conventionally upon
roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, with plum
pudding to follow, Mr. Marsden took his ease
in a comfortable armchair in the shady ver-
andah of his house upon the hill on the south-
west side of Parramatta. Down by the
river, in the streets of the town, the heat
was sweltering, but what little breeze was
going was to be found here on the heights.
The chaplain rested —with great apprecia-
tion of the blessings of rest and of good diges-
tion—and felt that he had earned an hour
or two of freedom from such of the worries
and troubles of other people as other people
.seemed disposed to load eternally upon his
broad shoulders and his broader sympathies.
For all his rough combativeness, Sam Mars-
den was a kindly Christian, and no tale of
genuine affliction ever came to his ears with-
out reaching his heart. He was a very
terror to rogues and near-rogues, - but to the
unfortunate he was never harsh or arbitrary.
Still, he hoped this afternoon that the Chris-
tian spirit of the season might even prompt
the unfortunate to leave him in peace for an
hour or two.
But it was not to be. With his silk hand-
kerchief over his broad, red features he had
hardly snoozed comfortably for twenty
minutes when ,he was awakened by the cough-
ing and shuffling of one who stood by his
chair.
“Drat ye!” he grumbled, as he pulled the
handkerchief away. “Is a man to have no
rest? Oh, ’tis you Simon,” he recognised
his groom. “Well, what’s the matter.”
“If you please, y’r honor, ’tis a lady in
the garden wishes most respectfully for to
see y’r rev’rence.”
“A lady! Pray, who is it, Simon —d’ye
know her ?”
“Well, mebbe not a lady, sir—but a very
respectable woman. She’s walked all the
way in from Toongabbie this hot day, a-
purpose for to see y’r honor, and’ll be cruel
disappointed, she says, if y’r honor can’t
oblige her.”
“Oh, well, show her in,” said Mr. Mars-
den resignedly. “Show her in. There is no
rest for the —just, Simon. Bring her to
me here.”
JAiid so was ushered in to him Toongabbie
Molly.
Until he looked twice at her the Chaplain
did not recognise in this demure, neat female
the frowsy termagant with whom he had
expostulated so forcibly three months before,
outside the little hut on the Western-road.
Her wild red hair was neatly plaited and
coiled beneath a snowy laundered hood, lier
dress was quiet and becoming to her good
figure, and her face was meek and gentle.
She curtseyed modestly, and stood awaiting
his pleasure. Mr. Marsden was filled with
astonishment.
“Great George!” he exclaimed. “ ’Tis
Toongabbie Molly, is it not?”
“Mrs. Molly Mollison, an’t plaize ’ee, zur,
a coom vor to thank ’ee for y’r gentle good-
ness, an’ to ax a favor of y’r rev’rence.”
“Sit ye down, ma’am. Why, bless my
soul, what’s come ho the girl? Ye look
a different woman! Well, well! But I
trust you’re treating poor Tom better than
ye did.”
“Oh, zur, my Tom be a good kind husband
as ever was, an’ no woman could treat him
ill. But lie’s give me this note for ’ee to
read, zur.”
She took a folded paper from her bosom
and handed it to Mr. Marsden. He took
it and read it, as well as he was able:—
Hon’d sur, thease is hoppin yor hon’s elth be
good an for to say mi moll is the best wyfe man ever
ad. i wd. take it kind was you to doe wat she
ask and ’twill be a good deed for all of us. Yors
to eomd. Tomas Mollison.
“Well, well, Mrs. Mollison, I’m truly
glad to find ye have seen the error of your
ways. Now, what is the favor you wish of
me. pray?”
Toongabbie Molly spoke earnestly and
seriously.
“If ’ee plaize, y’r honor, me sister’s coom
to th’ country, an’s i’ th’ Fact’ry now. Me
an’ Tom’d be glad if ye’d spare th’ time to
go down there an’ convart her as ye oon-
varted me. zur. She’m a rael hot un,
Maister Marsden, zur. If ye’d but take y’r
ridin’-whip down to th’ Fact’ry, an’ talk
to un as ’ee talked wi’ me- —wlioi, me an’
Tom thinks ’t would save her a power o’
trouble. I do hope ye’ll not vind it too
troublesome, zur. Plaize say ’ee will, zur—
I do besaich ’ee!”
Mr. Marsden looked at her in astonish-
ment. Then he subsided in his chair and
shook with silent laughter.
“Why, dash my buttons! Get along with
you, Toongabbie Molly—d’ye think I’m the
scourger!”
