Arabian Poetry
i Poetry is very dear to the Arabs. The
making of rhymes is an almost universal
occupation. From the earliest days of
Arabian history every event has been cele-
brated in verse. Family records are pre-
served in rhyme, and no subject capable of
expression in words seems to have struck
the Arabian muse as incongruous: a pimpled
face; a ragged burnous ; an attack of stomach-
ache ; a rotting camel-carcase. ■No wonder,
therefore, that a great poet and warrior
should begin a famous cassida with the
lament that there is nothing left to say.
±he Arabs claim great antiquity for some
°L t . 1 i ei r P° etl 'y. There is a certain distich
attributed to _ Adam himself. Even the Itig
V edas of India seem young and frivolous by
comparison.
I lie poet of this land has many technicali-
ties to master. There are 17 metres which are
recogmsed as classic, and each is adapted
to the expression of a particular sentiment.
Ihe opening line ordains the rhyme for the
whole poem, and this rhyme may be re-
peated an enormous number of times, a
crudity which is surprising in a people
whose devotion to poetry is so sincere. The
Japanese are said to be tone-deaf. The
most melodious of their modern singers,
lone Noguchi, admits that he believes this
.j , , e . case ! yet the Japanese have
avoided this fault, in spite of the fact that
in Japanese every syllable ends in a vowel
and there are only five vowels in the lan-
guage. lhey get over the difficulty by mak-
ng all their poems short.
That Arabian poetry should contain a
itrongly-marked metre or rhythm is only to
»e expected, since it had its origin in the
lida, or song of the leading camel-driver of
caravan. We may picture the early Arabs
mmng away the tedium of a march across
he desert with songs nicely adapted to the
jlting lilt of the camels’ stride. From this
hiinsy, lurching animal they "learnt rhythm.
Hey sang of many things upon these desert
mrneys: of war, or kindred; of revenge •
A he th e longed-for oasis; of
‘atli; of love and of remorse. The Arabian
ve-song was none the less impassioned or
nce i' e / rom thc faet that the singer be-
eved that love comes from the liver and
ason from the heart!
\\ riting was practically unknown in the
nd prior to a.d. 512. History divides itself
to three great portions:—
H) , Sabaean or Himyarite period —Boo b.c.
A.D. 000.
P/e-Mamic period— a.d. 500 to 622.

prose literature. The poets sang the liis-
y of the people, and preserved all records

ibian literature has lost much of its
lonal character.

e ancient Arabs regarded the poet as

. They believed the Jinns bestowed his

ribe turned in danger or difficulty. The

were preserved in fragmentary copies

Ihey were in rhymed prose. The
f the Koran is heavy reading, but
some of the Suras have a beauty of their
own, as, for instance:—
THE SURA OP THE MORNING.
By the morning bright
And the softly falling light
Thy Lord hath not forsaken thee, neither art thou
hateful in His sight.
Verily, the beginning is hard unto thee, but the enc
shall be light.
??? u * )e satisfied, the Lord shall thee requite;
Old He not shelter thee when He found thee in
orphan’s plight ?
not find thee astray and lead thee aright?
r>id He not find thee poor and make thee rich by
His might ?,
Wherefore, the orphan betray not,
And the beggar turn away not,
And tell of the bounty of thy Lord.
From the time of Mohammed there creeps
into Arab poetry a fierce fanaticism and a
terror of llell. This was later on softened
to some extent by Sufi influence. The
Mohammedan worshipped God for His power
to avenge; the Sufi for His love and mercy:
’Tis purest love when Thou dost raise
The veil to my adoring gaze ;
Not mine the praise in that or this—
Thine is the praise in both, I whs.
With the infiltration of Persian influence
came, as Prof. Nicholson remarked, “a lively
and graceful fancy, elegance of diction, depth
and tenderness of feeling, and a rich store
ot ideas.” But it is also noticeable that the
poems of this period (circa a.d. 800) deal
often with the praise of wine. The mystical
poetry of Arabia seems far below that of
Persia.
In 1258 occurred the destruction of Bagh-
dad by the Mongols, and from that period
the quality of Arabian poetry has steadily
declined. Mongols, Turks and Persians built
up great Mohammedan empires in turn, and
the Arabs played a subordinate part in all.
8yria and Egypt became their chief centres,
but their true inspiration seems to have
passed with their days of power.

I The period which immediately preceded
the production of the great Elizabethan
drama was one of varied experiment. Lyrica'
comedy with little more definite story than
a , ™ <)(^eru . revue struggled for a hearing with
staff and scholarly tragedy following the
Greek laws and the Greek method, but miss-
mg the Greek spirit. There was thought in
alt these efforts, skill in the handling of
details and much real poetry; but the true
path took a great deal of finding. Suddenly,
as if gathering up all the threads of experi-
ment into one skein of purpose, the master
I playwrights began their great work. To
suggest that anew theatre lias been passing
through just such experimental stages dur-
ing the last 20 years, and that another trium-
hhal soaring of the drama is about due, is
by no means a wild suggestion. In Aus-
tralia, as m England, many capable writers
with something real to say, and with a
genuine dramatic gift, have been trying hard
to find anew road. The old theatre has in
large measure lost its grip on the mass of
the people, who have fallen back on the
countless picture-shows as a makeshift for
the real thing which they miss; and the
time seems near when a great revival may
again force the drama into the central place
of literature and life which it once filled,
All the experiments and trials, the failures
and partial successes, the repertory societies
ind the freak plays that have appeared to
counteract their influence, may be in the
vay of preface to the restoration of all that

Royal Cord Tyres Are
Now Made by Three
New Processes Which
Have Revolutionized
Tyre Making
'T'HE development by the United States Rubber Company of
. tllre e remarkable new processes of rubber manufacture now
gives to Koya) Cord Tyres a quality never before reached by
any tyre. J
1. The New Sprayed Rubber. A method so effective that
a virgin rubber ol a quality never known until now is made
available to the world.
2. The New Web Cord. Of Specific application to the art
of cord tyre making. A process of treating fabrics and cords
with latex, making it possible to manufacture tyres and other
articles with a degree of strength hitherto unattained.
3. The New Flat-Band Building Process. A method of
building cord tyres which is revolutionary. Finally and at
last assuring uniform cushioning and resistance in cord tyres.
Taken alone, either of these new discoveries would be regarded as
of the utmost significance, but together they are hailed as the most
important advance in the field of rubber manufacture since the
discovery of vulcanization nearly a century ago.
These three basic discoveries, fully protected by patents in the
U. S. A. and other countries, are the exclusive property of the
United States Rubber Company, makers of Royal Cord Tyres.
Obtainable at all Garages.

it is the devoted Althea who, by taking
poison, subdues Gustav and brings her hus-
band back to sanity. It is impossible to
explain how all this is done except by refer-
ence to the play itself. Only a very fine
actor could possibly play the part of Gerard,
but the best tribute that can be paid to the
author is to say that if such an actor could
be found the third act of “Each Man a Mul-
titude” would be as tremendously emotional
as anything attempted on the modern stage.
The words are there, the ideas are clear and
explicit, the whole machinery of the terrible
thing is in order —even to the changing lights
that follow the changing personalities at war
in Gerard. The supreme difficulty lies in the
acting.
Still, a good deal of the emotional effect
is there even in the reading of the play :
and if it should never get beyond print it
has a definite value as an experiment in
translating the mental sciences of the day
into dramatic terms. If there is no 'road
out in this direction for the playwright it
may at least be said that the road is not
very far off. The man who can make such
an attempt should be heard of in the greater
drama that walks on the new highway of
success.

Ancient Diseases
I should very much like to have “ J.B.D.’s”
authority for the statement (R.P. 2S/2/’24)
that typhoid and small-pox were unknown
to the ancients. Syphilis, of course, was
almost certainly introduced from America by
Columbus; but it is the typhoid and small-
pox that stick in my gizzard. The great
plague of the Antonines, which, to my mind,
was the real cause of the decline and fall of
the Roman Empire, and was one of the
most ghastly visitations of disease upon
humanity that ever occurred, is generally
supposed to have been a mixture of typhus
and small-pox; and the plague of Athens
in the Peloponnesian War was almost cer-
tainly typhus, just such as so distinguished
the Balkans a few years ago. The great
plague of Constantinople in 542 was most
accurately described by Procopius, and any-
body reading his description as given by
Gibbon will be convinced that it was simply
our old friend the bubonic plague, which,
with typhus-fever, has always been the
special foe of dirty cities. But all these
epidemics, even the plague of the Antonines,
pale their ineffectual fires before the Black
Death of 1348. It was _so called because
hysterical and journalistic Nordic nations
took fright at it, just as to-day they call
syphilis the “red plague” or a “certain
loathsome disease” instead of saying its
name outright. The much more clear-
sighted Mediterranean nations called it La
Grande Mortalega, the Great Mortality,
which it most assuredly was: the Italians
knew that they died of it, and that was all.
We have quite a number of good descrip-
tions of it, and can now say with almost
certainty that the Black Death, in its vari-
ous manifestations all over Europe, was no-
thing else than the bubonic plague, showing
itself at different times and localities in
its different forms —bubonic, pneumonic,
haemorrhagic and septicaemic. There is a
splendid description of it in the prelude to
the Decameron of Boccaccio. It w y as in the
Black Death that medicine really first found
its soul, and that a doctor, Giiy de Chauliac
of Avignon, saw that it was his duty to stay
and help the poor devils to fight it out even
though he had learned from his Arabian
teachers that the plague was inevitably
fatal, and that he would certainly catch it.
In the famous Antonine plague Galen ran
from it; he took his description second-
hand from Thucydides’s account of the
Athenian plague ; and we should _ be much
more certain as to what the Antonine plague
really was if only poor Galen had not lost
his nerve and fled. As it is, there are other
descriptions less exact than a doctor would
have been able to give us.
But what a world of fleas and lice and
filth it must have been in the time of Marcus
Aurelius, Justinian and the Middle Ages!
All their glory departs when you think of
the stenches, over-crowding, dirt and scratch-
ing. The Romans must have been as con-
stantly scratching themselves as so many
monkeys; and as for the Greeks !
Of olden days I pray let others prate;
I think it lucky I was born so late I
Of course, the Romans had their hot baths,
and wasted a great deal of time in them ;
but we all found in the war that washing
the body did not get rid of lice; it was not
till they found that it was necessary to
bake the clothes that the army left off
scratching.
Probably during the Middle Ages and up
till about 1700 it might almost be said that
the normal cause of death in the cities w y as
the plague, and that was why it is such a
dread name to this day. But we do not
fear it because we know exactly how it is
spread, and, as Osier says, all that you
want to deal with an epidemic of plague
is a stout heart and a long purse. But if
ever the collective purse of mankind again
becomes short, as it was in the Middle
Ages, the Black Death will again lift its
ugly head and destroy a fourth of the popu-
lation of Europe. It is all a matter of
money. The rat and the flea are the worst
enemies of mankind. Man has defeated
them by growing rich and building rat-proof
houses. He has defeated most of his ene-
mies, but a greater than all has arisen, and
that is man himself. The sudden crowd of
desperate and starving prostitutes that seems
from all accounts to be infesting the cities
Europe does not mean that man’s
greatest enemy has become woman • it
really means that his greatest enemy
is himself, and this ravening crowd
of starving prostitutes will have to
be paid for in 20 years when syphilis begins
to act on the nervous systems of the present
generation of mankind.

Stephen Crane
Now that American writing is regaining
some sincerity and distinction there is a
revival of interest in Stephen Crane. At
least one short biography of him has been
published, and it is rumored that a collected
edition of his works is under way. i erliaps
justice will be done to him at last; more
likely there will be a temporary flow of gusli,
and his thin but definite genius will be so
puffed and overblown that its shape will be
lost. Also its significance. ,
Crane, was not a great writer. J-he xtea
Badge of Courage” and “Maggie still give
out an atmosphere of freshness, but they
gain their effects by a certain intensity that
cannot be prolonged. Crane was, by nature,
an impressionist, slightly lacking m those
intellectual qualities that give structure and
background to a work of art. One feels the
absence of perspective in his work, of some-
thing like a general view. Everything hap-
pens too immediately before the eye, and
this tension, tolerable in a short story, robs
longer work of that nice effect of depth and
distance that should make it grow in the mind
after the book is put down. His importance
lay in his very direct eyes, that could see
the realities of life beneath the innumerable
veils in which the America of his time had
swathed them. The final 10 years of -last
century and the first 10 years of this com-
prised the deepest gloom of the Dark Ages,
as far as literature in America is concerned.
The issues of the Civil War had been
settled, and people were engaged in weaving
-a sugary romance about them. Big busi-
ness was finding its feet and pressing every-
one into its service, from the men who gave
“inspirational” addresses at travelling Chau-
tanquas to the editors of glossy magazines.
Life was being reduced to a singular sim-
plicity. Nothing was worth thought except
the making of money, and that was easy if
a man kept smiling and never let his mind
stray from the racy texts above his roll-
top desk. G. 11. Lorimer’s "Letters of a
Self-made Merchant to Lis Son” ran into
countless editions; Ford began to make a
car that would reward • the virtue of the
smallest tradesman ; and the effete Spaniard
was routed witli no heavier odds against
him than 10 to 1!
A prosperous and self-satisfied epoch!
What use had it for literature? Henry
James, a faint-hearted person intent on sav-
ing his own skin, had already retreated to
Europe, feeling that a life so purged of all
significance and emotional content would de-
stroy him. Howells had stayed to look ten-
tatively at the show from the windows of
Harper’s Magazine, but his blood thinned
and a faint film grew over his eyes. Mark
Twain adapted himself more or less to his
environment. Instead of laughing at it he
tried to gain its respect by dabbling in
business; and he was not above showing his
face through a liorsecollar to amuse the
crowds at times. His penalty was financial
failure and a secretly embittered old age, as
shown by his desire to “blow the gaff on the
whole human race.” Crane was not an
exotic. He was a young man of healthy
tastes who would have been fairly happy in
any society, but this America seems to have
been too much for him. His one gift of
clear, intense vision was distrusted. Although
his “Bed Badge of Courage” had some suc-
cess, pressure was brought to bear on him
by publishers and editors to wear spectacles
of the right shade. A stark way of writing
about war, as luminous as Tolstoy’s in his
Sebastopol sketches, w y as not suitable to
those glossy magazines that were read in
steam-heated flats by people for whom all
the furnaces of life were obscured in the
basement. Why use salt when sugar was
cheaper and more palatable? Why not go
down to Cuba and write lyrical journalese
about Teddy Roosevelt and his Rougliriders?
Crane was an obliging young man, but he
was an artist, and could not surrender his
personal vision. Whenever he sat down to
write a column of popular description his
sincerity took charge of his pen, and the re-
sult probably seemed harsh and perverse to
his editors. It is not merely that they were
journalists. The so-called “literary” men ol
that day were as blind to his quality as the
newspaper men. There was a way of look-
ing at life, sanctified by a host of writers
from Owen Wister and Richard Watson
Gilder downwards, and any man who wmuld
not adopt it must have something morbid
and neurotic about him! It is astonishing
that they even found physical reasons to
account for his clear-sightedness. Conrad,
Ford Madox Hueffer and other men who
knew him intimately have testified that he
was not in the least dissipated; yet he was
accused of drinking, drug-taking and all sorts
of vices. “When people see a banker taking
a glass of beer in a cafe.” Crane complained,
“they say, ‘There is Smith.’ When they be-
hold a writer taking a glass of beer they
say, ‘Send for the police.’ ” That just about
sums up the matter. Crane, though an easy-
going, slang-loving young American, eould
not accept the sentimental view of life, and
so a stigma must be placed upon him! Per-
haps his traducers really believed there was
something radically wrong with a young man
who could amuse himself by cutting down
Richard Watson Gilder’s poems to the mini-
mum of idea and emotion they contained. If
so, their error dies with them. The poems
concerned hardly survive even in anthologies,
but the memory of Crane remains, a bright
little spring in a desert.
The trouble is that Crane might have been
something more. He was born with integ-
rity of spirit and a pair of honest eyes, but
there was nothing in the life around to
develop him. Conrad’s picture of him in
his reminiscences shows that he remained
to the end a simple-hearted boy. This in
itself would be enough to mark him out from
the America of his day, which was a land
of spoilt and sophisticated young women.
VANCE PALMER.
A Satchel of Books
Practical Radio, by Henry Smith Williams (Funk
anl Wagnalls). A book that eminently justifies the
adjective in its title and will come as a godsend to
that army of people whose interest has been caught
by the broadcasting idea and are blankly ignorant
of the technical aspect of the thing.
Butterfly Lore,by H. Eltringham (Clarendon Press).
A handy little volume which gives the general
reader, in language he can understand, an account of
the structure and life history of the butterfly, and
should leave him with a respectful interest in many
caterpillars which he has hitherto contemptuously
flung over his back-yard fence.
The Little Tigress, by Wallace Smith (G. P. Put-
nam’s Sons). A series of tales and impressions of
Mexico by an adventurer who uses a stark pen to
write of what he knows. There is a reek of blood
and sweat about it and plenty of melodrama ; but
it is obviously melodrama carved raw from liffe and
is set down with a tolerant appreciation of Mexican
motive and character.
The Cloud that Lifted, by Maurice Maeterlinck
(Methuen). Two plays by the great Belgian, “The
Power of the Dead” and “The Cloud that Lifted,”
both in modern settings, the one French, the other
Finnish. The Finnish story is full of strong situa-
tions, with, of course, a sombre final curtain, and
it ought to be a stage success. The other is excel-
lent reading ; but as the bulk of it is dreamt by one
of the characters who wakes up in the middle of
the last act, it would tax the ingenuity of a pro-
ducer to put it on in such a way as to make it
han°- toe-ether
° togetner.
In Brightest Africa, by Carl A. Akeley (Heine-
mann). The author, who is a well-known American
big-game hunter and animal sculptor, gives a fasci-
nating account of several African expeditions under-
taken with the object of studying animal life and
securing museum specimens; and his close-range
view's of elephant, lion, gorilla, leopard and rhino-
ceros enable him to impart many new and interesting
facts about them. He disposes of the popular stories
of the w'anton ferocity and woman-stealing proclivi-
ties of the gorilla, and he counts the African ele-
phant the most fascinating animal in the world
(although man has been meeting him for thousands
of years, he “knows mighty little about him”).
There are thrills a-plenty in Akeley’s narrative—he
once saved his life by grasping a tusk of a charging
elephant in either hand and sw'inging in between
the two, and he killed a leopard with his bare
hands—and from all viewpoints he has turned out
an absorbingly interesting book.
My Russian Life, by Princess Marie Amtole Bariat-
inslcy (Hutchinson). This lady, whose husband was
an A.D.C. to the late Czar, talks pleasantly about
the Court, its habits and pastimes, without saying
much that is quotable or significant. Much of the
gossip deals with people who have now left the
stage of Russian politics for back seats in the gallery,
and it is surprising to find that the Princess, whose
family w r as stripped of practically everything by the
Bolshevik Revolution, confines her bitterness to the
expression of a few mild little snorts at the new
regime. One of her most interesting chapters deals
with the national belief in omens, and on this topic
she recalls a singular happening. During an Imperial
salute in the presence of the Czar, one of the guns,
which it is alleged was surreptitiously loaded with
grapeshot instead of with the usual blank, broke
a window of the palace, but the only casualty
w»as a severely wounded policeman, whose name hap-
pened to be Nicolai Romanoff!
Sarah Bernhardt as 1 Knew Her (Hurst and
Blackett) is the inside story of Sarah’s life as told
by he, intimate, TMrMe Berton to .n Fnglith
writer, Basil Woon. According to this authority,
she was the daughter of a demi-mondaine who was
long associated with the celebrated Comte de Mornv.
This genial aristocrat, who was alleged (on insuffi-
cient grounds) to be the actress’s father, showed
her far more affection than her mother, who found
the child an inconvenience. She was an unruly girl:
her record of misdemeanors is as amazing as her
list of generosities. It is recorded that she once
pretended to be dead, and the rigor of death was
so well simulated that preparations were made to
bury her. Incidentally also she was expected to
make a big reputation as an artist before she had
ever thought of the stage. There is a cutting extant
from the Mercurk de France of 1860 which refers
to her “extraordinary talent,” and further remarks
that she “will be classed as one of our greatest
painters.”
From, a Friar’s Cell, by Fr. Vincent McNabb
(Blackwell). Herein a Dominican states the law of
his Church about many things, and the statement
has the imprimatur of his archbishop and provincial
prior. The student will find it useful for reference
on various points as to which even informed Roman
Catholics are hazy. On the subject of the .Resurrec-
tion of the Body, for instance, with which tne more
practical question of cremation is associateci: in

THE NEW BEALE PIANO
Chosen by ‘Eminent English ‘Pianist
to Rodong Hall
Kirribilli.
Dear Sirs,
It gives me much pleasure to
state how delighted I am -with the
Beale Baby Grand purchased from
you a few months ago.
‘The tone scale is wonderfully
rich and full, and the touch and ac-
tion are so fnely balanced that the in-
strument would satisfy the demands
of the most exacting per former.
For tone, touch, finish and
fine 'workmanship I consider it un-
equalled.
So satisfied am 1 with the in-
strument, that I wish you to immedi-
ately instal another in my city studio.

HEN an eminent musician chooses an instrument for his own persona? use, he is guided in his
choice by a very definite set of factors. Unlike the average individual, who has not devoted half a
lifetime to the study of tone, its production, control and, in the case of a piano, the qualities which
make for durability, he has that knowledge which enables him to select the very best. The New Beale Piano
has been honoured by the patronage of many eminent pianists. Some of these have been artists who have
played it on the public platform. Others have chosen it for intimate use in their own home—the strongest
form of endorsement.
Mr. E. Bennett North is a talented English accompanist, who has appeared with some of the most famous of the present-
day celebrities, viz. Madame Clara Butt, Madame Ada Crossley, Madame Daisy Kennedy, Madame Rosina Buckman,
Madame Elsa Stralia, Madame d’Alvarez, Mr. Maurice D’Oisley, Mr. Jean Gerardy, Dr. Brodsky, etc. He has played
practically every make of piano without discovering any that he values more than the New Beale. When he came to
Australia some months ago to take up permanent residence, he purchased a New Beale Home-Grand for his personal use,
and that he considers it a perfect medium for the expression of his art is evidenced by the letter which he recently wrote to
us and which is reproduced herewith.
The New Beale is made in several models, finished in genuine rosewood, walnut or mahogany_not stained imitations,
tis available as a piano for manual use, as a player-piano and as a reproducer-piano. Those who have not manual dex-
terity equal to their intellectual understanding of music, will find an ideal complement in the New Beale Player-Piano.
It supplies all That untrained musicians need to fully express their musical ideals; tone, technique and interpretative
qualities, bold on an extended payment plan that makes possession very easy. "Silent” pianos taken in part payment.

How much of your day is worry?
?
EVERY DAY has twenty-
four hours. The richest
man has no more time*, the
poorest has no less. And all men
must divide their days into three
main divisions —Work, Recrea-
tion, Sleep.
But there is a fourth division.
In proportion as you get rid of
it, you add to your income, your
standing and your peace of
mind. In proportion as you give
way to it, you find it spreading
like a cancer over the three main
divisions of your time.
Its name is Worry.
Effective work cannot he
done by men whose minds are
wandering in futile concern
about their bills, their business
positions, their futures. No man
can benefit from his round of
golf or his evening at home with
a book if he is really far away —
fearing a pressing creditor or
to-morrow’s work.
And if worry follows you to
bed at night—then, indeed, you
have little chance for happiness
or even physical health.
There is a way out. There is
an outside influence ready to
help you reduce the hours or
minutes that worry steals away
from you. There is an outside
influence that has made the lives
of 200,000 other men happier as
well as more prosperous.
Its name is the Alexander
Hamilton Institute.
You have read about it as a
training for ambitious men.
Think of it now in another way
—think of it as an agency that
will banish the needless worry
out of your days.
If it is more income you need
—the Alexander Hamilton Insti-
tute has helped every conscien-
tious subscriber to earn more
money. Many have doubled
and tripled their salaries m one
year. If you need a better, more
dignified, more permanent posi-
tion—trust the business judg-
ment of the 27,000 managing
directors who have enrolled.
Here is a curious fact to
which 200,000 Institute men can
testify. The very moment you
tear off the coupon at the foot of
this page, you will feel the satis-
faction that comes from having
taken a step forward—a step
that may be a decisive one in
your life.
Tear it off now, and hold it
your hand for a moment. Say
yourself:—
“If I mail this coupon,
something is going to hap-
pen ; an outside influence
is going to work in my be-
half. lam going to find
out whether it can do for
me what it has done for so
many others. lam going

—and receive the Definite
Plan of Business Progress
which it promises.’’

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Madcap.
When glamor over the green lawns lay,
And flower and tree in the noontide slept,
A wind came out of the south to-day
And into the Gardens swept.
It glided over the slopes, green-grassed,
With grass-seed played, and with thistle-
down ;
For glad it was to be free at last
Of roving the tiresome town.
'Twas glad as only a wind can be
That free and fresh through a green place
goes.
It whispered low to a laurel-tree,
And wakened a sleeping rose.
Down alleys, chequered with shine and shade,
It danced its way to the lilied ponds;
Arched ferns awoke at the sudden raid
It made on their shining fronds.
It piped, piped low, and a blue wren heard ;
It piped—piped on to the feathered throng,
Till Jack the Jester laughed loud and stirred
Grey thrushes to sweetest song.
The doves, aroused from their tree-top sleep,
Cooed low and soft at its cool caress;
It sought a place whore the willows weep,
And fondled them, limb and tress.
Next, lawless growing, it raged, and then
Dead leaves it gathered in haste, to fling,
As they strolled by. in the eyes of men,
For it w r as a madcap thing.
Rose-scent it plundered,. and lilac-scent;
Then paused, all breathless, a moment's
space;
And spied blue water, and straightway weut
To trouble the Harbor’s face.

The Cutter.
Far off a white sail streaming
As changing winds allow,
Like some swift seagull gleaming,
Is seen at last. And now
Out of the hazy distance
Against the storm’s resistance
It makes, with sure persistence,
For granite cliffs of Howe.
Folk wait for months together
The coming of old Chris.
Through heavy seas and weather,
When storm winds howl and hiss' i'
Or threatening tempests mutter
Or wild seas snarl and sputter,
There is a little cutter
The settlers never miss.
A shout of friendly greeting
Across the inlet roars.
Soon old mates will be meeting
Along these lonely shores.
Grey bearded, tall and striking,*
Chris looks a grim old Viking,
But seas are to his liking—
And Chris brings in the stores.
His cutter’s only twenty,
Or less than twenty, ton;
But days of full and plenty
Come after Chris’s run.
Smiles break from eager faces.
He’s bringing in full cases—
Flour, ribbons, oil and laces
And stores for everyone.
He’s brought her safely over
From Cunninghame afar,
Through stormy seas, The Rover,
Frail as a floating spar.
And now, the white sail flashes.
Through whirling foam that splashes
A little cutter dashes —
It’s Chris inside the bar!

The Old Stone Steps.
Green stains upon the stones where heavy
dews
Have made a tiny runnel from the leaves —
Or, maybe, ’twas the bright, slow-falling
tears
Of penitents who mounted on their knees
The shallow grooves of wearing centuries,
Deeming this way the path to holiness !
The sun makes orange dapple on the stair
Or sea-green waves of tempered, bough-
snared light,
Where one da_k ivy leaf has pressed its
palm—
A hand outspread but secret—on the wall.
This vine, no doubt, has yielded many a leaf
Which the apothecary steeped in draughts
To cool some stout, high-living abbot’s head
After a night’s carouse. Maybe beneath
This secret, flattened hand it keeps the sign
Of bygone trysting on these silent stairs,
When something slender, muffled in a hood
Or midnight length of cloak, slipped softly
down,
Her pointed shoes no noisier than a moth’s
Light-feathered wing. For they were satin
slioon
And scented like the court. A jewel’s click
Might hint a rising breast beneath a gown
That had but lately rustled in a dance.
The upheld flounce reveal a spill of wine.
Where the silk stocking, crinkled in its sheen,
Missing a stolen garter, made her trip.
There as she crept beneath the arch, a gate
Swung open and a darker shadow passed—-
Hampered in going by a swinging sword
And bound for this heart-fluttering rendez-
vous —
Right glad because the leaves were fallen
thick
To muffle high red heels that gallants wear.
Perhaps the ivy hides to-day a kiss
That came to being centuries ago,
Where now a lizard basking in the sun
Yawns, catches flies and thinks this is the
world.

THE SHELVING OF SINGAPORE.
Out of the murk of political battle in Bri-
tain over the Singapore question one clear
fact emerges: it will be as much as the
Macdonald Ministry’s life is. worth to pro-
ceed with the dock-building scheme on the
cost-careless lines of Imperial tradition. The
British —and more particularly the British
workers —have long been tired of paying for
Dominion Jingoism, and the proposal to
spend £10,000,000, and perhaps a great deal
more, at Singapore has come at a time when
the unemployed number over a million and
three-quarters, and the nation is faced with
the building of 100,000 new houses a year.
British Labor and a large section of British
Liberalism see no reason for the presence of
a powerful fleet in the Pacific, anyhow. They
are pacifist, and, despite their recent lesson
from Germany, cling to the old view that
wars can be averted by kind words and
soothing gestures. The London Daily
Herald (Labor) said last week:—
Singapore is a direct provocation to Japan. A
cheap base would be no solution, as the cheapest of
provocations cost too much.
And the Nation (Liberal) remarked that
the strategical aspect of the scheme was out-
weighed by the threat it offered to interna-
tionalism, or words to that effect. But above
all looms the question of expense. In the
words of the London Express :
Mr. Macdonald explained to the Admiralty that
the Cabinet was unwilling to proceed at present,
owing to the state of the finances.
And Lord Beatty (First Sea Lord) said he
quite understood. It is unlikely that many
Britishers consider the Singapore project
unnecessary on strategical grounds, or unde-
sirable because it may annoy Japan (the
British Empire exists to-day because the
Little England section in the U.K. has
always been negligible), but the volume of
opinion favoring the view that debt-burdened
England should not be saddled with practi-
cally the whole of the cost appears to be
overwhelming.
* * * *
The Old Diplomacy is not nearly so dead
as it was represented to be when Britain’s
new Prime Minister moved into Downing-
street; and the only plain statement of what
is at the back of the nation’s mind was mflde
bx*d:he irrepressible Admiral Percy Scott
Mr. J. It. Clynes’s committee quashed Singa-
■" pore it would save Britain millions, and enable
Australia and New Zealand to spend their own rgoney
on their own defence, instead of British money on
. more work at Singapore.
\Now, Admiral Scott is a believer in' the
efficacy of air defence, and he repudiates
the idea of capital ships being of value in
the next great war. That being so, he is a
logical patriot in advocating the quashing
of Singapore, and a logical Empire man in
advocating that Australia and Maoriland
must themselves provide the relatively small
amounts required for a modern air fleet.
Unfortunately this busy propagandist, who
has seen no active service for nearly 25
years, is not an infallible authority. He has
against him Beatty, Jellicoe, Sturdee,
Cowan, Field —in fact, every naval officer
who achieved distinction in the World War.
Also the Admiralties of all the Powers.
Japan made a point of retaining the Mutsu ;
the U.S.A. is replying with the Colorado,
with her 32,600 tons displacement and her
eight 16-inch guns possessing a range of 20
miles; and Australia is now viewing the
Hood. If Scott is right, then the whole
world of modern naval thought is wrong. If,
on the other hand, the fighting admirals and
leading naval, architects of to-day know their
business, then Australia’s safety, in the event
of Singapore being given the go-by and ships
of the Hood class excluded from the Pacific
for combatant purposes, will rest on our
capacity to keep crowded Asia in a Christian
frame of mind. There is a type of politician
who makes a habit of depicting the world as
a gentle and holy place in which the lion
would lie down with the lamb in peace and
loving-kindness if certain ill-disposed persons
would only cease to talk armaments. The
promulgation of such views gives the politi-
cian a reflected glow of saintliness, and grati-
fies internationalists. Nevertheless, there is
no sense in them, and that honest and clear-
thinking clergyman Canon Barnes put his
finger on the chief reason why the other day:
We can only get international peace if the repeated
increase in the population of Europe comes to an end.
The population increase of Europe is, of
course, nothing to that of Asia. The effec-
tive Japanese birth-rate is more than double
that of the United States. Official figures
compiled in California for 1920 show that
for that State the increase of the Japanese
by reproduction there was 10 times greater
than that of the whites. Japan is an emi-
grant nation from which adults are continu-
ally pouring into California, Canada,
Hawaii and any other part of the world
that will have them ; yet every year the pro-
blem of where and how to dispose of the
surplus mouths grows more and more baf-
fling to the authorities. Japan controls
Korea, much of which is suited for farming.
But the Japanese farmer cannot compete
with the Korean, whose standard of living
is amazingly low, and he suffers from a like
handicap when opposed economically to the
Chinese of Manchuria. How, in the circum-
stances, can he help turning hungry eyes on
Australia, where every prospect pleases ex-
cept the Alien Immigration Restriction Act
—a measure more provocative than a dozen
Singapore bases!
* * * *
To say this about the Japanese who are
our friends —as all nations are friends until
a question arises about which they feel im-
pelled to fight—is not to level an insult; it
is to state a truth which such ruthlessly
logical people as our Northern neighbors
would be the first to accept as unchallenge-
able. The possession of Australia, or the
abandonment of the White Australia doc-
trine—which for practical purposes would
amount to the same thing—ought to solve
the brown Empire’s social and economic
difficulties for all time; certainly it would
do so for three or four centuries to come.
There is no more constant rule in history
than that when a desirable and undefended
country is confronted by a desirous and
overwhelmingly powerful country the former
is absorbed. If the world’s admiralties and
Britain’s most eminent sailors know their
business, Australia will be undefended, un-
less Singapore is munitioned, garrisoned with
at least 10.000 white troops and rendered
capable of docking a vessel of the Hood class.
To put it in another way, unless Britain’s
capital ships—the ships that made her mis-
tress of the seas in Nelson’s day, and that
are keeping her so still—can fully use the
Pacific, the control of it will automatically
pass to a navy which is not so handicapped.
The change may mean loss , of trade to the
United Kingdopi; it will almost certainly
mean miscegenation, if not total loss of
national life, to Australia. There is a school
in Britain, composed of socialists, anarchists,
pacifists and so forth, whose members would
consider the Dominions, and their racial
ideals, well lost for disarmament; even for
the limited instalment involved in a British
retreat from the Pacific. But it is safe to
say that the majority are with us. They
do not accept Admiral Scott’s view that
their own country or Australia, or any other
considerable part of the earth’s surface, can
be wholly defended from the air, and they do
not believe that the saving involved in the
abandonment of Singapore would be worth
while from any standpoint whatever. As
against this there is. the clearest evidence that
Conservatism is just as resentful as Labor at
our past policy of leaving most of the burden
of defending this upstanding and affluent
part of the Empire to the taxpayers of Bri-
tain. If the Singapore Rase scheme is held
up for six months, or till the Macdonald
Government is defeated, the delay may have
the salutary effect of waking the Common-
wealth to the hideous precariousness of its de-
fence .position. By coming forward with a
thoroughly adequate' proposal to co-operate
financially, Australia and M.L. may be able
to induce this or some future British Gov-
ernment to proceed with the Singapore
scheme. If they fail they will be left with
the duty of defending themselves, a task
which, as the population of the two
Dominions stands, they are wholly unfitted
to undertake.
FULLER’S POOR JOKE.
The habitual royal commission has been
appointed to consider the question whether
some new States should be made out of
N. S. Wales, and to pursue every
side-issue which a perverted sense of humor
can hang on to the question. There are
two main varieties of royal commission. One
; is set up to arrive, as rapidly as possible, at
a foregone conclusion, so that the Ministry
may pretend to be driven to do something
it is ashamed or unwilling to do on its
own responsibility. The purpose of the
other is to waste years in the hope
that the subject under discussion may
die of old age, so that the Ministry
may escape doing something which it has
neither the courage nor the honesty to refuse
outright. The first variety was set in motion
when it was a matter of raising Parliamen-
tary salaries to a point which almost
amounted to plain robbery, and of getting a
Cabinet’s criminal friends out of gaol.
Fuller’s is the second variety. It is a joke
of a sort. But of a very poor sort.
* * * *
There are nine problems on the Commis-
sion’s business paper, the ninth being an
omnibus problem covering “any subjects rele-
vant to the foregoing,” and “the foregoing”
is such a wandering tale that very many
things might be relevant if the Commission
wanted to prolong its labors and expenses.
With such abbreviation as is possible this is
its burden: —
(1) Whether the re-subdivision of N. S. Wales
into two or more States could be effectively carried
out without incorporating parts of adjoining States,
and, if not, what parts of what States would be
necessary to achieve success, and what should be
the boundaries of any new States proposed?
This raises the large and burning question
whether George Fuller can cut up his own
land for sale without cutting up other
people’s land next door. It is a fresh idea
for bringing adjacent States into the argu-
ment, or hanging it up because they won’t
argue.
(2) Whether any such subdivision would benefit
the whole or any part of N. S. Wales, and, if so, in
what ways; also the probable effects, political,
financial, economic and social; etc. ?
It might have been added: “Likewise physi-
cal, moral, intellectual and spiritual, to say
nothing of hygienic, collateral and agricul-
tural.” The reasonable answer is that the
effects will probably be good or bad according
to how the parties concerned manage things,
and they will very likely present some re-
semblance to the consequences that ensued
when Maoriland, Tasmania, Victoria and
Queensland broke away. Anyhow, it isn’t
George Fuller’s responsibility to provide
for the whole future, even if he was qualified,
for he will be dead most of the future, and
a Commission composed of a District Court
Judge, a city accountant and some sundries
may supply him with an incorrect prophecy.
. (3) The manner in which the debts and assets
shall be apportioned.
One simple idea is for each State to keep
the assets that are insiefe its borders. For a
new nprthern State to own the Sydney har-
bor bridge, or for a Sydney Government to
possess the Armidale water supply, would
he unhandy. If a truck, or something,
chanced to be standing right on the border
line at the moment of division, and each
Government was dying for that truck and
no other, the matter could be decided by
arbitration—or by gravitation if the truck
showed a strong tendency, either way. The
cost of every asset, including each mile of
railway, is oh record; sd is the amount of
debt per head not. represented by assets. The
amounts are ridiculous, but that can’t be
helped now. A Federal Commission might
administer the joint debt, if necessary, till
sufficient loans fell due and were renewed
in the name of the new State to enable it to
carry away its own separate burden tied up
in a red cotton handkerchief. Or the Com-
monwealth might exercise its unused power
to take over State debts or parts of debts,
and act as temporary trustee for the new
State.
• * * * *
Up to this point Premier Fuller’s joke
struggles along a moderately sane if un-
necessary path. But the fourth question on
which his Commission is to take the evi-
dence of local farmers and others is in a
new category. It is to find out “in what,
way the present representation of N. S.
Wales in the Senate and Representatives
should be divided between any new States.”
The Constitution says that no original State
shall have less than six Senators, wherefore
it is assumed that N. S. Wales, being still
original though diminished, will have six. It
says that representation in the other House
shall go according to population, so that
matter will settle itself so far as the old
State is concerned. As regards new States,
it is explained clearly (Chapter VI) that
the terms on which they will come in are
exclusively the Commonwealth’s affair ; there-
fore no local fusser or busybody need waste
his brain-tissue over the matter. In two
more instructions the Commission is directed
to say whether any new State shall have
“the same legislative, judicial, taxing and
other powers” as an old one, though it is
difficult to say who is to have these powers
in a new State if the State itself hasn’t
them. It is also to decide whether a new
State shall be governed by a Parliament, and
what kind of one, and, “being elective” (even
the question of whether the place shall be
allowed to elect its Parliament is to be pon-
dered over), what the franchise will be like.
In this matter George Fuller, struggling
with a fate which is clearly too large for
him, might take a hint from Britain, which
in its dealings with Ireland was neither so
fussy nor so consequential. It gave an Irish
convention a lot of scope, in drafting its own
Constitution, and didn’t perform like a hen
with one chicken, or a cat on hot bricks, or
any other animal absurdity. Similar con-
duct on the part of the N. S. Wales Premier
might materially facilitate action—if action
isn’t the last thing in demand.
The last matter in Fuller’s complicated
witticism which really counts is embodied
in Clause VII; for Clause VIII is merely
an instruction to report on how to “consti-
tutionally effectuate” anything the Commis-
sion may propose, and IX only says that
that body is to tackle, in addition to the
matters specified, everything under the sun
which has any bearing on the situation.
The final question is:—
Should each new State own and control the rail-
ways in its borders, or should all railways be
handed over to the Federal Government to secure
uniformity of gauge and control?
The investigation by five N. S. Wales gentle-
men into the proposed subdivision of N, S.
Wales is thus to branch off into the ques-
tion _of whether Queensland, Victoria, Tas-
mania, South Aus. and Westralia should
hand, and whether they are willing to hand,
their railways to the Commonwealth, and
•whether the Commonwealth would be willing
to take them. And it is to sub-branch off
to the question whether certain districts,
which want separation mostly that they
may have absolute power to build railways
to their own ports, many of which are now
kept useless and inaccessible by Sydney
influence, would like to forego the one thing
worth having, and become dependent on
another outside Parliament which is also
largely Sydney. It might be a simple idea
to form the new States, and let them decide
matters for themselves, but the momentous
ponderosity of old men forbids.
OVERHEAD CHARGES.
When Australia was first redeemed from
its long obscurity and opened to the white
race it offered nothing but work to the adven-
turer. Other lands had opportunities of
loot, rich native markets, goods that could
be bought for a string of beads and sold for
high prices, and swarming native populations
willing to work for small reward. Australia
had none of these things, but by real sweat
was capable of being made richer than most
other countries. As a result, a very small
population of white men has been able to
exploit a huge area and produce great
wealth ; and, as a further result, a large per-
centage of the population has been able to
live without producing anything at all.
Though from the very nature of the conti-
nent the call to work is more insistent here
than elsewhere, comparatively few hands are
actually at the plough. The majority are
working at tasks that duplicate one another,
or stand off giving directions to other people
who give directions to some more people,
telling them how to direct the few that are
really making wealth. The ship of enter-
prise is manned by scores of captains to
every dozen or so able-bodied seamen; and
the tendency is to increase the number of
officers and diminish the number of those who
actually pull at a rope. Take the kind of
organisation to be found in many smaller
city businesses. Smith, McNab and Mtjkphy
decide to pool their resources and start a
factory. Smith alone of the trio knows the
work and becomes factory-manager; McNab
becomes business manager ; Murphy is called
secretary or sales manager, or something
else. Though Smith is quite capable of
carrying the whole work both of factory and
office, there are three salaries to be paid.
McNab and Murphy have less to do in 12
months than a junior clerk would get through
in a month; yet they ride peacefully on in
the car for which Smith alone provides the
motive power. Not only is this so, but the
two idle partners have authority, and, being
idle, often use it to hamper the work which
they never understand.
In the case of the larger companies the
actual weight of the deadheads may not be so
much in evidence; yet there the faith in “the
board” is often ridiculous*. The demand for
immediate results and immediate dividends
by the men who do not know the nature of
the thing undertaken too frequently hampers
and harries the men on whose brains and
energy the enterprise hangs; yet the remedy
for mistakes and losses is almost always
sought in more inexpert direction rather than
in increased supervision by men who know.
More than this, human nature being what it
is, few men will do their best work under
inexpert orders. The ordinary pick and
shovel man will give full value for his wages
in the clay-cutting to the boss who knows
what a clay-cutting is; but a managing-
director might rise from his office throne and
roar himself hoarse in ordering a gang of
navvies without getting anything like value
from the workers. The same is true in prac-
tically every department of industry; yet
the modern idea appears to be that a great
number of inexpert people can in some magi-
cal way combine to speak with the voice of
an expert. When the actual proportion of
the working population to the population
which directs or assists in directing, or runs
errands for those who assist in directing, is
taken into account, a good deal that has been
said about the inefficiency of labor and the
unrest of the workers requires modification.
* * * *.
The overhead expenses of our system of
government with its seven Parliaments and
throngs of officials seem to have become the
model for everything else. Business men
know well enough the enormous loss of driv-
ing power which is involved in having so
many salaried men who render little, if any,
service, but they have become so accustomed
to the idea that as long as their machines
seem to bear their load they are content to
carry on in the old way. Yet the position is
very serious. While a thin and doubtful
stream of immigration is doing a little to
further develop the country, another thin
but constant stream of country dwellers
pours into the cities. Rural districts are
not maintaining their population; and in a
very real sense the greater part of the city
is an overhead charge on the work done in
the country. So the whole of Australia pre-
sents the curious spectacle of a mere hand-
ful of people on the soil and another mere
handful engaged in secondary industry,
while around them surges a huge throng of
members of Parliament, directors, managers,
officials, clerks, office-cleaners, deadheads and
attendants upon deadheads, the whole
sprinkled thickly with Ministers of the
Crown and lightly dotted with imported
Governors. Australia at first offered nothing
but hard and profitable work to its people:
and through all the years work has been
splendidly rewarded with increased national
wealth. But the working ideal is rapidly


fading into mere talk. The exploitation of
the few who are really doing things is much
more profitable and easy than the exploita-
tion of the stubborn earth. The breaking
strain of a community such as ours is hard
to calculate, but there must come a point
when the load is no longer bearable. The
real problem of the immediate future is not.
so much the settlement of Australia by
people from overseas, but the settlement of
Australia by Australians. A. means must
he found of turning people from profitless
work to work that produces and develops,
and of thus reducing the enormous number
of the idle employed. More honor and more
reward must go to the expert and less must
be left to the directing layman. If Australia
can pi’oduce great wealth under the present
system, the difference that would be made
by turning our whole man-power on to the
job is almost beyond calculation.
WAR.
In the two years of front-line service that
I saw in Palestine there was no instance
that I remember of any fraternising between
Jacko and our own troops; All we ex-
pected of Jacko, and all we got from him,
was sudden death if he could give it. His
greeting, instantly we came within range,
consisted of showers of vicious shells.
Every minute of the day and night, when
we were close enough, we listened to the
hiss of his machine-gun bullets as they
sought us. And we repaid in kind.
One night I remember when we thus “fra-
ternised,” a night similar to many others.
Our brigade was lining portion of the pre-
cipitous hills that form one side of the
Hebron valley. The Turks were waiting
on the opposite line of hills. Between the
two ran the white Hebron road. All along
the roadside we had hurriedly dug shallow
pits, about a hundred yards apart, in among
the bushes where possible. In each pit
were a lance-corporal and four men. This
was our outpost line. High up on the
black hills rising behind us was. our
brigade, and for many miles beside it
stretched other brigades—waiting. On the
opposite line of black hills, also waiting,
was the left flank of the Turkish army.
To the _ watchers on both lines was
visible, right away to the sea, a crescent of
lightning, of stabbing light, of vivid sheets
of flame that leapt from the earth towards
the heavens around the old town of Gaza,
with the long, zigzag streaks of rifle and
machine-gun flame that marked the re-
doubts of Ali Muntar.
But to us, down in the dark valley, came
only the subdued roar of the artillery that
spoke of the main bodies of the fighting
armies. We had cares of our own; for
opposite our outpost pits were the outpost
pits of the Turkish left flank. Exactly
opposite our own tiny post, across the road
and just out of bomb-throw, was a similar
Turkish post. For us five men crouched in
our little pit the main factor in the great
battle that night lav in the pit opposite.
Suddenly a- voice called from the darkness
ahead in very fair English, “You theer,
Australie?” “Yes,” called one of our men.
“What do you want now, Abdul? Some
lead?” “Ah, no,” came back easily. “We
have plenty here, waiting for yous. We
just wants to tell yous are the sons of dogs,
the offsprings of pigs !”’ Not one of us
popped our head above the pit to reply to
the insult. We were not that raw! We
simply crouched lower, bayonet-points rest-
ing against the pit-edge, bombs ready for a
quick throw.
Then a Surry Hills man, a chap with
imagination, answered the Turk’s bombast.
“Gam, Abdul,” he called. “Yer the son
frf a donkey out of a Mullumbimby heifer.
Why don’t yer wash yer neck? Rats to
you and yer lousy Prophet!” From a
well-concealed machine-gun possy behind the
Turk, but a little to the right, came a
sneering guttural voice. “Are you neffer
goin’ stop talking, Oustralia?” Vy dun’dt
yon be mens? Gome oudt und vight mit
uns?” A bush lad in our pit jerked his
hand to his mouth and shouted, “Shut your
dirty mouth, you mongrel Hun! You’re
not in this argument. You are just a” —
well, it doesn’t matter. The passages* that
followed were not in the least interesting;
and we waited quietly for the much more
entertaining comment of the Turk. “Yous
still theer, Australie, yous pups of Englese?”
lie called again. And so the exchange of
insults went on, we being assured, among
other things, I remember, that Abdul
would spit down on our rotting bones from
Paradise.
Surry Hills and Stamboul were still at
it when a rifle cracked right beside our
pit; and simultaneously the landscape
crashed back oil us in a blinding sheet of
flame. A vicious spray of machine-gun
bullets hissed through the choking fumes
and smother of dust. The rending con-
cussion brought the shallow walls in, spew-
ing over four struggling men, and filling
us with the fear of Turkish bayonets before
we could get our limbs, mouths and - eyes
free of the clogging dirt. But the roar of
the explosion died away in the long valley ;
the rattling stutter of the machine-gun
ceased, leaving all the world in a deadly
silence except for the boom of the distant
Laza artillery and the thumping heart-
beats of two pairs of poor, scared, waiting
devils m the blown-in pit.
What had happened was simply this.
. bl , e the Turkish n.c.o. had kept us engaged
in pleasant conversation, one of his men
had crawled on his belly in the shadows
across the road until he was within easy
bomb-throw. Then he threw. But our cor-

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Bilk of Central Europe.
It was one of the complaints of the British
Liberal party during the electoral campaign,
and before it. swallowed itself and became
the Ministerial tail, that the party of
Rambling Macdonald wanted to levy
£3.000,(100,000 on its own people because
they were friends, and to cut down the levy
oii the Hun to £2,000,000,000 out of regard
for the fact that he was an enemy. Now
the Macdonald party shows little sign of
an earnest desire to collect anything at all
from the enemy. When J. Bull resumed
buying from Germany he made the stipula-
tion that the British importer was to pay
26 per cent, duty, which the German Gov-
ernment was to refund to him, the amount
to be reckoned as part of J. Bull’s share of
the indemnity. It was a brisk way of col-
lecting a trifle if it had come off;* but the
Hun promptly ceased to meet his obligations,
and the British importer found that he was
paying Fritz’s indemnity for him. Now
Fritz has given his IOU for the arrears (the
IOU of a country that has repudiated its
paper money bolus bolus), and got the im-
post reduced to 5 per cent. So it can’t be
said that J. Bull has been a roaring success
as a debt-collector, or shown any great de-
sire to be one. On the other hand, Bis-
marck’s countrymen have scored: they have
paid a trifle in the way of reparations, but
they have collected at least twice as much
by selling depreciated paper money abroad
at bargain rates to people who thought it
would recover. Fritz has thus been receiv-
ing indemnities instead of paying them. The
whole tale of his manufactured or syn-
thetic bankruptcy makes wonderful reading.
Returning to a land where the mines and
factories and fields were untouched by war,
while those of some of the Allies were a deso-
lation, he clothed himself in rags, and pro-
ceeded to weep bitterly about his inability to
pay anything. He reduced taxation to
almost nil to keep the treasury empty.
Measured in real money, and not' in fancy
paper values which have no meaning, he.
charges himself about one-third as much in
taxes as the Briton or Maorilander, and. is,
probably the least burdened white man on
earth. The Government paid everything that
it did pay with tons of unsecured paper, and
in accordance with an infallible law in such
cases gold vanished like a scared rabbit dis-
appearing down a hole. The,real money was
sent abroad for investment, and money re-
ceived abroad for goods or in payment of
freights was allowed to remain there at in-
terest. Silver and copper became rare, and
a time arrived when it would have been
almost a pleasure to see some of the zinc
currency which was coined to swindle the
unfortunate Belgians with during the days
of the occupation. Labor men, out of the'ir
chronic admiration for the despotic and
militaristic land which produced Karl
Marx, seem much more inclined to take this
simulated poverty seriously than other poli-
ticians. For one thing they hear of poor Ger-
man workpeople. But of course there must be
some real suffering; for a gang of capitalists
can t play wild pranks with the currency
without sowing trouble. That, however,
doesn’t affect the situation that the allegedly
defeated Hun is not paying, though he seems
to have unlimited funds for public w 7 orks,
shipbuilding, etc.; and instead of letting him
know that his evasions are not regarded with
favor, Labor politicians are vigorously beck-
oning him to leave the dock and take a
seat on the Bench as a full member of the
League of Nations.
A Job for a Select Committee.
Melbourne Age considers some aspects of
the moving-picture situation :
The film industry is in a bad .way owing- to
the .fact that it cannot compete with American
dumping-. The number of films produced last
year was fewer than the year before, and the tendency
is still downwards. The American producing com-
panies have an enormous home market for films,
and make most of their profits out of the home
market. They can afford to dump their films on
foreign markets at prices With which local companies
cannot compete. They have established subsidiary
companies and acquired city theatres, and are carrying-
out a campaign which has been successful in New
York. At certain city picture houses only “super”
films are shown. These will not be exhibited in the
suburbs or the provinces until their run in the
c-ity is finished; and the longer they last in the
city, the higher the price charged to suburban and
provincial renters. If the industry is to be. saved
from extinction it must be given some form of
protection against American competition. France
imposes a tax on imported films based on the cost of
producing similar films in France. The German
who imports a foreign film must export German films
, of. similar value to the country in which the imported
film was produced.
It is a substantially correct statement of
what is happening in the Commonwealth.
But the article w r as really written by the
paper’s London correspondent, and refers .
to the position in John Bull’s land. Con-
cerning the operations of the American
monopoly in its own country, the Age is
as silent as other daily newspapers. Yet
these operations are more extensive than
those carried on in Britain, and the influ-
ence of the rubbish exhibited is correspond-
ingly greater, which means worse. In ,T.
Bull’s territory the photo-play has for-
midable competitors in the spoken drama,
opera, oratorio, the ballad concert, orches-
tral and hand music, musical comedy, vau-
deville, lectures and radio. In Australia,
apart from a few cities and large towns,
this competition is unimportant or non-
existent : as a rule, the picture-show is the
only regular entertainment available. Again,
the English started turning out films in
1899, a decade at least before the first
Australian experiment, and, except during
the strenuous years when production ceased
in both countries —when, as has been said,
Britain made war and America made pic-
tures—their output has always been greater
than ours. Further, British showmen,
being able to pick and choose, buy French,
Italian and Swedish pictures, which our
tame, Yankee-bossed patrons of the movies
never see. Hence the fact, .recently alluded
to, that Australian imports of U.S. exposed
film now exceed the footage sent across the
Atlantic to Britain. Humiliating as the
statement is, this easily-satisfied nation has
become the best foreign customer for the
pictured banalities, imbecilities and inde-
cencies of Hollywood, home of dope parties
and shooting bees, and unless Parliament
does something the degradation will be per-
manent. Britain, though nominally Free-
trade, imposes a tax of a penny a linear
foot on imported positives—i.e., films con-
taining a picture and ready for exhibition—
and of od. a foot on negatives— i.e., films
containing a photograph from which posi-
tives can be printed. The corresponding
imposts in “Protectionist” Australia are
only Id. and 3d. per foot! They are merely
revenue duties (a really protective duty on
positives would be fid. per foot or there-
abouts), and considering the annual tribute
paid to the U.S.A., the revenue is pitifully
small. Of course, income-tax is supposed
to be levied on profits, but income-tax can
be evaded. The Age correspondent asserts,
apparently on the authority of London
Morning Post, that it is being evaded in
Britain. In this fashion :
A parent company in America will charge its sub-
sidiary co. in Britain say £IO,OOO for the English
rights of a film on which it has already made a sub-
stantial profit in the American market. It is utterly
impossible for the subsidiary company to get £IO,OOO
by renting the film to English exhibitors ; but if it can
get £2OOO, more than half of that sum will be clear
profit. The cost of the negative and the positive
copies produced from it will not exceed £SOO, and
the office expenses and other charges in connection
with renting the film will not reach £ 500. But
the prices charged by the parent co. are so high that
the subsidiary co. never shows a profit. Accordingly
it pays no income-tax, whereas English companies
that have been ruined by U.S. competition used to
pays 6s. in the £.
The scrappy reports issued from Australian
taxation departments fail to disclose whether
this dodgery has or has not been practised
in the Commonwealth. It may be recalled,
however, that when the film duties were be-
ing discussed in the last Parliament the
then Minister of Customs stated that “in
the case of companies whose parent house is
in America all profits are remitted to the
parent house”—this was one of the “rea-
sons” he gave for not imposing ad valorem
duties. Whether Australian income-taxes
came out of those profits or whether the
tax-collector was warded off by altitudinous
values fixed on the other side of the Pacific,
the House was not told. There was talk in
those days of asking for the appointment of
a. select committee to draw up a scheme of
protection for the Australian film industry,
such as it is, and ascertain, among other
things, if foreign exploiters of the business
are contributing their fair share of taxes.
The subject should be rivived in the
approaching session of Parliament. That
select committee is overdue.
♦
J. Bull's Tree-planting Government.
British Labor having got into office, the
“uncouth crooks” of the party have promptly
set out on the track which led to so much
trouble in Australia. Their scheme is to
form a committee or over-Cabinet of 15, who
are to manage the party and keep up com-
munication between it and the Ministry.
Twelve are to be disappointed men who
didn’t get into Parliament, and three are to
be Ministers of the more “advanced” type,
who will thus exercise a sort of authority
over their colleagues. If the scheme works
the 12 non-Parliamentary suspicioners will
be almost necessarily elected at meetings in
London, for a national election is impossible,
and the loan of a ballot-box with a sliding-
panel would be a kindly Australian attention
in the circumstances. Apparently the
“white ant” party is out to snatch power
from the Rambling Macdonald Cabinet
before there is any real power to be snatched ;
but undue haste has always been the white
ant’s failing. Meanwhile the Government is
making poor headway with its one really big
job, the unemployed question, and a super-
vising junta of private detectives is hardly
likely to be helpful. The other day it was
grumbled at for its inaction, with this result:
Mr. Shaw said that after only six weeks in
office the Government could not produce schemes
.like rabbits from a hutch. He emphasised that the
intention >vas to explore every avenue, and provide
useful work.-,’.' He referred to the acceleration of work
by the Government departments, costing nearly
£3,000,000. He hoped to effect large schemes of
arterial roads, investigate afforestation, and make
peace with the rest of Europe as with Russia.
Compared with that flabbiness, Australia’s
Lawsons and Rarwells look like baby Bis-
marcks. .Unemployment had been a very
big national problem for three years when
the Rambling Macdonald Ministry took
office, and the only reason for taking office
was the possession of a scheme for dealing
with it —a good or bad scheme, but at least
a scheme. Baldwin had one, but wasn’t
allowed to try it, though he got a far bigger
, vote than any other party leader. Plenty of
editors and bankers and parsons have one.
Our own Percy R. Meggy has one which he
produces, “like a rabbit from a hutch,” in
the correspondence columns of the daily
press. Whatever may be thought of it the
possession of a definite plan and a firm belief
in it puts Percy R. Meggy miles ahead of
Labor Minister Shaw. Macdonald once
had a plan—he proposed to make a levy of
£3,000,000,000 on capital. But even before
the election he said he would refer his plan
to a committee of financial, experts to find
out if there was anything in it. and if they
said there wasn’t he would instruct them to
show some other way of inventing
£3,000,000,000. That left him. too, without a
plan except the plan of telling some strangers
to give him a plan. And what he proposed
to bid them find has been looked for by all
the great financiers of history, and not found.
Sully would have given his title for it.
Colbert and Necker would almost have
given their heads. , Walpole might have
parted with his robberies, confident that he
could rob some other day. Gladstone
would certainly have sacrificed his umbrella.
The situation, as defined by Minister Shaw,
is specially wild and weird in a small,
densely-peopled land like Great Britain :
(1) The Ram. Mac. Government has spent
£3,000,000 on public undertakings, which presum-
ably includes the cruiser-building that the fuss was
about. It seems like 50s. per unemployed, and
when the work is finished the handful who were
provided with short jobs will be jobless again.
(2) The same combination proposes to make
“arterial roads” in a country that is almost all road
already, including Roman road. This is also tem-
porary and unproductive, and those employed will
soon be jobless again.
(3) It proposes (most wonderful of all) “to investi-
gate afforestation.” Mere investigation is a poor
diet, and even planting trees is a small business in
such a small country, and the town unemployed don’t
understand trees, and, at best, it is one more tem-
porary makeshift.
(4) This is the last, for Minister Shaw, being
asked what was dene or proposed for the unemployed,
had only four things to say. The Ramshackle
Government proposes “to make peace with the rest
of Europe as with Russia.” Yet there is no war with
any part of Europe except a tariff war, which con
sists of the other fellow hitting Ramshackle and
that faddist not hitting back. And as the other
fellow finds the arrangement pays he won't make
peace—not unless Baldwin’s method is tried.
John Burl's financial year ends on March
31, and it is customary to present the new
budget pretty soon after that. So the down-
fall of the tree-planting and peace-making
Cabinet, and the end of its ill-cemented alli-
ance with two men who cordially dislike
each other and have no real affection for
Macdonald, is fixed for June. But if the
internal white-ant movement prospers any-
thing may happen any time.
The Billion-Dollar Bluff.
“J.E.” wants to re-write history:—
I would submit, in a tentative fashion, and not
by way of being the real authentic fount of wisdom
(though I may be without knowing it), that a
great deal that has been written about Woodrow
Wilson’s part, and the United States’ part, in the
Great War is done from the wrong angle. The key
fact is left out. Even when the President, after
more than two years of bitter provocation, endured
with angelic patience, delivered a speech which
sounded like war, and diplomatic relations with the
Hun were suspended, he didn’t intend to fight, or it
might be more accurate to say he didn’t expect to
fight, though it is much the same thing. The
leisurely Congress which declared war two months
later (there was no indecent haste in the way of
a special session that I remember) didn’t expect
to give way to violence either. And a great part of
the nation had no idea of real scrapping and coarse
butchery—perhaps the majority of the nation.
In the opinion of this very large portion—per-
haps this majority—of Uncle Samuel’s dominions,
the future was cut and dried. The Kaiser would
learn that there had entered into the war the most
numerous white nation on earth; also the richest
nation, and one which had never lost a war or been
looted of any territory. The very considerable con-
tempt of hard old European strategists for the kind
of wars the United States had won, and the kind
of forces it had won with, and the kind of armies
it had won against, was not much understood by
the people who had licked Spain and scattered the
serried hosts of Mexico. The great and gold-plated
republic having added itself to the growing list of
his enemies and thrown a sword like Goliath
McSamson’s into the scale, William 11., like a cir-
cumspect Kaiser, was to realise that the game was
up. He was to set about making peace while he
still had an unbeaten army and an almost un-
damaged, though considerably scared, navy to back
his demand for easy terms—in fact, while he could
still pose, though with difficulty, as a magnanimous
victor offering terms.' Then the United States,
though unfortunately too late for the war, was
to sit in a prominent place at the Allied Council
table and be in lots of time for the peace, and
supervise the general putting straight of the world.
It was a very reasonable forecast, but it didn’t
take account of a very unreasonable Kaiser. He
failed to understand, even then, that he had lost
his golden opportunity when Joffre stopped him
at the Marne in the first weeks of the war, or
that his brilliant U-boat campaign was liable to
flicker out, just like his brilliant and overwhelming
campaign on the road to Paris. Least of all did
he suspect that the cause of all that had happened,
and of all that he never expected to happen, was
that he himself was an imaginary War Lord and
a bogus Man of Destinv. In fact, there was a
general misunderstanding. The United States spent
money magnificently, and gathered recruits lavishly,
and bustled wonderfully, but it experimented with
new military frills and inventions, just as if it was
a time of profound peace, instead of adopting the
devices which had already proved successful, and
though the pace was fearful the progress was small.
But for flic British and French instructors who
rushed across the Atlantic to train the new recruits
there might have been almost no progress at all.
The business being doomed in the very nature of
things to be a gigantic bluff, there was for long
an air of unreality about it. The bluff developed
into very stern actuality, and in the end the United
States people were probably glad that it did; but
there is no reason to believe that any definite origi-
nal “policy” was based on the idea that, it would.
If the law of lese-majeste had allowed his very
capable and candid biographers to paint William
11. earlier than they did, various mistakes might
have been averted. The ex-Kaiser appears now as a
particularly nasty little boy who never properly
grew up. He annotated State documents with silly
and often obscene jests, and one way to his heart
and to promotion was to provide him with a new
anecdote more, nude than the last. In a humbler
walk of life he would probably have been the kind
of domestic tyrant who takes soundings of the
liquors and measurements of the food as a precau-
tion against embezzlement. His demand for adula-
tion was unlimited, and his belief that the adulation
was more than deserved was unlimited also. As the
chief lickspittle had the best chance of the chief
office, William the War Lord didn’t begin the
trouble of 1914 as grandfather William did that of
1870, with the aid of three such geniuses as Bis-
marck, Moltke and Yon Roon. The soldiers he
selected, and whom he trained in his own wildly
original but spectacular manoeuvres, were an ordi-
nary lot. But a pair of dug-outs, too old to have
been completely spoiled by the imperial guidance,
Hixdenburg and Ludendorff, partially redeemed
the situation. The War Lord really didn’t know
that he was without the Bismarcks and
Moltkes and Yon Roons, because lie sup-
plied the • places of all three so efficiently
himself. The gigantic United States pre-
parations didn’t, apparently, create in him a pre-
monition of disaster and a feeling that it was time
to break off the game with the least possible loss
simply because his belief that “Me and Gott”
eouldn t be defeated remained till his sun was on
the rim of the horizon. The tottery nature of his
front line * long escaped his notice through judicious
absence from the Front, a place which was muddy
and bad for the uniform. A wiser Emperor would
probably have fallen to the great American bluff,
and profited thereby, and a wiser President would
probably have realised that bluff was as much wasted
on such an Emperor as biting sarcasm on a
rhinoceros.
Woe to the Winners!

which accounted for the depreciation of all
the belligerents’ currencies during the war.
Niggardliness became insanity. Huge stores
of food, metals, minerals, cotton, wool, oil,
and every other war-necessity were bought
up, regardless of the fact that not only was
it impossible to pay for them out of revenue,
but the money could no longer even be
borrowed. Hence paper, or imitation mono*',
with consequent devaluation, which increased
with every ton of the stuff issued. When
the fighting ended some of the nations were
able to check their extraordinary expendi-
ture on the spot. For example, Germany.
Not a single German factory had been even
injured, not a bridge blown up. not a road
destroyed, not a field, orchard or farmhouse
devastated. Germany faced the peace with
no foreign debt, no obligation to reconstruct
its chief industrial region, and practically
no defence taxation—it was indeed ordered
to completely demobilise. The French did
not claim an indemnity, after the manner
of Bismarck half a century ago, when
£200,000,000 was paid the Fatherland for a
six months’ war fought wholly in France.
Their claim was solely for compensation on
account of damage done by the invading
armies. Germany having defaulted in its
reparation payments, the French had to
continue the repair of their factories, roads
and bridges, and rebuild their levelled towns
and farm buildings, out of their own
pockets. They have thus had to carry the
mad expenditure of the war period into the
era of peace, or face the same fate they
would have met after the Marne battle if
they had economised on shells or guns.
Naturally, prices are rising, the franc has
been falling violently, and the nation is
threatened with a catastrophe as dreadful as
that which it imagined had been averted
when the Armistice was signed. In the
words of the strongly pro-German London
Nation :
So long as France continues to pile up debt and
indulge in heavy annual expenditure on the expecta-
tion of “recovering” from Germany the sums dis-
bursed, she is heading for the perilous region of
deliberate inflation of the currency.
This is all very well for the Germans, who
find themselves, after losing a criminal
gamble which might have meant world-
dominance for them, in the position of hav-
ing stabilised their own currency and bank-
rupted that of their hereditary enemies. But,
granted that France did not make the best use
of the peace, how any of her allies, and in par-
ticular Britain, which has always stood for
fair play and financial probity, can view the
present situation with complacency, passes
comprehension. If the principle involved in the
Franco-German situation is accepted by
civilisation, a premium will be put on the
very sort of war that thcatens to overthrow
civilisation —that is, on TAMERLANE-like
forays for loot which, if successful, leave
the invaded nations enslaved, and, if unsuc-
cessful, leave them ruined without any pros-
pect of redress.

Lawson and the Cockles.
The Victorian Farmers’ Union, reviewing
the arrangement by which five members of
the State Country party were included in
the Lawson Nationalist Ministry, decided
at Bendigo last week that the party should
continue to hold separate caucus meetings
and acknowledge no limit to its right to con-
test seats at State elections. It also re-
solved that the understanding with Lawson
should last “for the life of this Parliament
only,” that there should be no alliance at the
general election, whenever it might happen,
but that after the people had given their
verdict the Parliamentary Cockies should be •
empowered to make a new agreement, with
Lawson’s party or another, approved by the
central council of the V.F.U. Subject to
these provisions Lawson was promised “the
fullest support.” His reply was to announce
that tin- composite Cabinet had ceased to
exist, and that he was forming another
Ministry from which Allan, Old, Goudie,
Wettenhall and Crockett, his Cocky col-
leagues since September 7, would be ex-
cluded. He had an unquestionable right to
resign if he considered the V.F.U.’s con-
ditions intolerable, but he might have com-
municated his intentions to the Agrarian
leader before rushing to Government House.
Victoria has known leaders who would have
been more courteous. It has known leaders also
who would have refused to remain in office
by the grace of a group from which they
had parted company: for the reconstituted
Ministry will inevitably be at the Country
party’s mercy. But. having been Premier
since March 21, 1918, Lawson has got into
the way of imagining that his State cannot
rub along without a Lawson Government.
He is destined to be undeceived. The
authors of the Bendigo resolutions have been
enthusiastically abused, but their position,
'veen' in one important respect, is sound.
r "”iey were warranted in dismissing the im-
pudent claim that sitting Nationalist mem-
bers were entitled to immunity from opposi-
tion. Acceptance of that contention would
have been tantamount to an admission that
their party has no right to grow—that its
place is second fiddle in an orchestra domi-
nated by Nationalists. They were likewise
justified in rejecting the demand that they
should instruct their supporters to give the
Nationalist candidate their second votes.
Still, the Cockies constitute a third party,
and may remain in that position for years.
And just as the public is entitled to an un-
fettered choice of representatives, so it is
entitled to be protected against the obvious
dangers of third-party rule. It is not enough
to say that the Parliamentary Agrarians will
assist in the formation of a Ministry if an
outside body not responsible to the people
approves. Guarantees are needed that gov-
ernment will be carried on without capri-
cious changes, or the purchase of support
with concessions. These guarantees will
only be forthcoming if the Cockies in Vic-
toria, and wherever they exist as third par-
ties. accept the principle of elective Minis-
tries.

The Speck Labor Government, which reached
office five months ago by reason of the fact
that Lyons’s followers happened to be the
only solid section in the House, has survived
its first session and slipped into recess. It
THE MAGNET.
“The Postmaster-General (Mr. Gibson) is delighted with the prospect of his trip abroad. Mr.
Bruce said Senator Wilson would remain in England until after the opening of the British Empire
Exhibition. Mr. Gibson would thus be enabled to take his place and watch Australian interests at the
Exhibition and attend the Postal Conference.”
THE KID: “ Steady, gents! Keep your seats and don’t make such a welter of it, or
someone’ll get killed in the rush!”
was a pretty strenuous session while it
lasted, but largely because of the energy and
tact displayed by Ministers, particularly
Lyons himself, the Government managed to
get nine-tenths of its financial proposals past
both Houses. The Uppish House exhibited
rather more than its usual tendency to run
amok among the new taxation proposals,
but Premier Lyons never allowed the Elderly
Personages to forget that Federal financial
assistance would not be forthcoming unless
Tasmania showed her bona fides by raising
at least another 10s. a head by taxation.
This naturally had a steadying influence on
the Irascibles, for it was obvious that if
the Federal grant failed the last state of
the tax-resisters would be worse than the
first.
From a Sydney specialist:—
The Bulletin's remarks concerning the Sydney
Public Library (6/3/’24) describe that malodorous
institution exactly. 1 would like to add, as a doctor,
that the place is a menace to public health. Quite a
different type of reader to the one encountered in
the Melbourne, Adelaide and Perth Public Libraries
is found here. With the exception of a small
handful (including, it is to be hoped, the writer of
the acid paragraph in The Bulletin) the frequenters
of the Sydney building suggest Domain dossers, greasy
foreigners of unpleasant habits and other representa-
tives of the Great and Permanently Unwashed.
Amongst them one may see sufferers from all kinds
of diseases —a few days ago, when I had occasion to
visit the place, 1 sat opposite to a man whose neck
was covered with a syphilitic rash; alongside him
was a girl undergraduate in her ’teens. On wet days
the reading-rooms are crowded to the doors by a
soaked and sodden mass of humanity, driven in from
the streets and the parks because they have nowhere
else to go. Every cubic centimetre of the air is
used up, and the atmosphere is filled with carbon
dioxide. The spitting, coughing and sneezing that is
continually going on must result in billions of patho-
genic organisms filling the air. There is a shameful
lack of proper accommodation for those desiring to
work there, the entire establishment possessing only
two small tables for genuine students.
«
The stodgy diplomatic game may grow quite
cheerful when a new and energetic man
takes a hand —a man of ideas. These are
some recent happenings :
The British Government officially “recognised” the
Government of Badeggski at Moscow. This wasn’t
necessary for purposes of trade, as trade had been
going on for years. Non-recognition of a Government
is no bar to trade. It was just a kindly act, to
show Badeggski how much Ramsay Macdonald liked
him.
Badeggski wasn’t so overcome with surprise that
he couldn’t reject the first British ambassador offered
him, a mere Labor M.P. He said he was particular
about his ambassadors. Then he asked for a loan
of £150,000,000.
He was informed that he must first admit his old
debt to Britain. He might say that he couldn’t pay
the interest and go on defaulting, but he was to
cease from his attitude that he could pay but would
see his old ally sizzling in Sheol first. On these
terms Britain was to take Badeggski’s bond for the
proposed amount, however bad the bond might be,
and give goods for 80 per cent, of it. The rest of
the money (British money secured by said bond) was
to be used to recoup British subjects who had been
pillaged by Badeggski.
Badeggski said, or Ins inspired papers did, that no
such swine as Ramsay Macdonald and his Govern-
ment had previously cumbered the earth.
Hearing of these things, President Obregox of
Mexico asked for recognition also. He admitted being
a usurper, but pointed out that all Mexican Presi-
dents were the same, and that if nobody usurped the
government there would be none. He said he hadn't
repudiated the debt, or abolished religion, or oppressed
more than necessary for his own safety, or killed
anybody exoept in battle. As he was only the
eleventh President since 1911, affairs, he said, were
fairly settled. Anyhow, his record showed him a
better gentleman than Badeggski, and what was
Britain going to do about it?
So the business of recognising scalawag
foreign Powers lias its exciting moments.
If the proposed deal with Russia comes off
the Cold Country will have parted with
many millions’ worth of goods (in the pro-
cess of making which some employment will
be created, of course), and collected nothing
but another stack of paper. But the need
for employment is intense, and if the gay
and gallant Mexican offered to take ail
the unsold clo’ in Bradford and give his
fleeting Government’s p.n. at 10 per cent.,
he might be better received.

In its good work of determining the condi-
tion of apprenticeship in various callings,
the N.S.W. Board of Trade has met storm-
clouds. A few years ago the unions in the
engineering trades secured awards which not
only threatened but actually hindered Aus-
tralian expansion in engineering. An em-
ployer had to have three full journeymen
employees before he was entitled to indenture
an apprentice, the usual “or fraction of"
being purposely omitted, so that actually a
shop employing five journeymen could employ
only one apprentice, one with two journey-
men none at all. This rule cut out the small
shop, the most useful apprentice school;
and it was practically impossible for a man
in a country town to get his boy indentured
there. Worse still was the union’s insistence
that if, owing to slackness in trade, a firm's
employees dropped below the prescribed quota,
apprentices had to be put off, in which case,
of course, the contract with them was broken.
When the Board of Trade started its inquiry
into apprenticeship in the engineering trades
the workmen’s representatives merely at-
tended to announce that the unions would
have nothing to do with the matter. Now
the Board, proceeding without them, has
reached a finding that there may be an
apprentice to each two journeymen “or frac-
tion thereof”; also, it permits of an appren-
tice starting at 18 for a reduced term.
There is overwhelming evidence in favor of
both conclusions ; but the unions are out
to advance the immediate interests of
their members, and just what will happen
when an attempt is made to put the new
rules into effect remains to be seen. Union
officials shrug their shoulders about it; and
the Fuller Government is not one which,
on its record, is likely to give any very force-
ful backing to the Board.

In Friday’s S. M. Herald the Rev. R. B.
Hammond proved that prohibitionist America
is about six times more law-abiding than N.
S. Wales:—
The number of prosecutions under the Volstead Act
per million of the population per annum works out at
263. Now of prosecutions for breaches of the liquor
laws in N. S. Wales the rate per annum per million
is 1588.
Sir Basil Thomson, of Scotland Yard, gives
a different explanation of the immunity of
law-breakers in the Land of the Free: —
In the U.S.A. one out of every 12,000 of the popula-
tion is born to be murdered and less than two per
cent, of the murderers are brought to justice, in
England the number of murders works out at one
out of 635,000, and 94 per cent, are solved.
It is not that the American people are naturally
more lawless than the British, it is primarily due ro
the fact that the official police number less than
one-half of what is considered necessary in England
in proportion to the population.
The fact that 94 per cent, of Euglaud’s
murderers are arrested as against 2 per cent,
of the U.S.A.’s certainly goes to establish
his theory that something is wrong with the
TT.S. police system. Many people, including
the Americans, have suspected it for years.
But a police-shortage, however marked, is
hardly enough to explain America's present
50 to 1 preponderancy in murder. A likelier
cause is the desperate and yet futile attempt
to impose prohibition.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Tasmania lias decided, by the casting vote
of the Speaker, to import another British
Governor if it can get one. Probably the
isle had an eye to the main chance, for a
peer or baronet with a little money about
him spends the £2750 per annum, and some
of his own to boot. But the Macdonald
Government had a better (or equally good)
billet to give away recently, for the Lord
High Commissioner to the General Assembly
of the Kirk of Scotland gets £2OOO a year
for a few weeks’ ornamental toil per annum,
has a king’s palace to live in when on duty
and a State coach to ride in, and has to go
no further than Edinburgh. And the ap-
pointment has been given, not to a duke or
marquis or earl as heretofore, but to James
Brown. M.P., miner, who dwells in a white-
washed cottage in a wee village in Ayrshire.
Possibly Tasmania will get James’s brother
Alexander, and it may be that he will spend
the odd £750 per annum in Hobart, and take
the £2OOO home with him. And then there
will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of
snobs.
From the Gallery :
Having thrown Allan and his friends overboard,
Premier Lawson will now meet Parliament with a
new Gnash crew- and rely on his old allies’ hatred
of the Labor party to save himself from destruction.
But it is unwise to bet on this possibility, since
the Agriculturists have much to gain and little to
lose by forcing a dissolution. Their present seats
are safe and the country is sick of Lawson’s promises
and compromises. The man from Castlemaine knows
that his command of the party would disappear to-
morrow if Alexander Peacock made a bid for the
leadership. But the Kookaburra is old and tired.
And he is loyal to a pal. Only these factors pre-
serve Lawson in a position that his record doesn't
entitle him to hold.
Gathered in tlie lobbies :
It has been printed that the Page section of the
Federal Cabinet is nervous over the Bendigo resolu-
tions anent composite Ministries, but I don’t think
their leader will be prescribing aspirin. The resolu-
tions apply only to State politics, and such references
as were made to Page, Stewart and Gibson were
all complimentary. The interesting trio have toiled
frankly for their supporters—for one thing they have
vastly improved the rural telephone and postal ser-
vice—and this counts for high merit in the eyes of
men who recognise that their voting strength in
the House of Reps, is small. Personally, 1 think that
Page and his lieutenants have done so well that the
farmers’ Federal organisation will give its blessing
to the alliance with Bruce, in hopes of further favors
to come.
This, from Sydney Telegraph, is the
regulation twaddle about the huge loan which
has been sitting on the chest of Australia
The money now required is to honor an obligation
inherited from the war.... The debt has been already
contracted in order to secure us in the ownership
of the Commonwealth, with all its resources,
developed and un leveloped, which, had we lost the
war, would have passed into the hands of a foreign
enemy.
Which is the guff that dreams are made of.
The £118.000,000 liability, representing, even
at 5 per cent., a burden of £1,400,000 per
annum, wasn’t incurred “to secure us in
the ownership of the Commonwealth,” for
the question of ownership was definitely
settled in our favor before the matter was
mooted. It was incurred to secure W. M.
Hughes in the ownership of his job by means
of the soldiers’ vote, and to give the most
unsatisfactory, waspish and arrogant Prime
Minister Australia ever possessed another
spell of undeserved salary. It is well to
keep the facts in mind in case he or some
other of his type comes around, wanting to
save the country again for a big wage and
a mysterious £25,000 testimonial.
“They kicked me out of the Common-
wealth Government, so I can say what I
like about them,” General Eyrie told a Syd-
ney audience the other day. Frank, and
what he then said was no doiibt quite true.
But if he hadn’t been “kicked out” he
wouldn’t have said it: admittedly he would
have gone on helping the others to carry
out a policy of which he strongly dis-
approved. Nice and honest our party-
government system is.
ONE UP AND T'OTHER DOWN.
“The Nationalists are worrying about the State elections in Westralia on March 22, and in South
Australia on April 5.”
BARWELL (to Mitchell ): “Go on—you’re first!”
The N.S.W. Premier finds no end of
obstacles in the way of the New State move-
ment, though he yearns after it worse than
the Devil yearns after holy water. This was
one of his latest: —
The Premier is also in a quandary as to how the
Crown lands in a new State will be administered.
Would it be by the old Lands Department, or would
another new Government department be set up at
the public expense?
The Bulletin is in a position to relieve the
Premier’s mind. The new Government will
look after its own land, and collect the rents
and the balance of the purchase money. It
will do this for the same reason which makes
Geo. Puller, when he acquires a new pro-
perty, take over the management as well as
the property, and he doesn’t get into any
quandary or bog of hesitation over it either.
The Sydney A.L.P. executive hopes to
keep Communists out of its Easter conference
by obliging every delegate to sign a declara-
tion that he belongs to the Labor party and
no other. It is a rather futile test, for Com-
munists have notoriously left their Moscow-
controlled organisation and wormed their
way into the Labor party, their plan being
to capture it from within. These particular
gents, will sign the declaration and smile at
the executive’s simplicity. But they wouldn't
do any smiling if they were asked to furnish
a pledge that they believe in and will work
for the White Australia policy. That would
compel them to recant a favorite Red doc-
trine and bring them up against the Com-
munist Internationale, which has instructed
the Communists of the U.S.A., Canada and
the Commonwealth that they “must con-
duct an energetic campaign against all anti-
immigration laws.”
Some of the evidence elicited by the H.C.L.
Commission in Victoria is not exactly what
those who demanded the investigation expec-
ted. A Footscray agent testified that his
firm had more dwellings on its hands than
at any time since the war. So much for a
typical industrial suburb. An agent from
St. Ivilda, where the exclusives nest, related
that the number of houses to let during the
last six months exceeded the total for the
previous five or six years. Other witnesses
declared that land-booming, profiteering rates
for materials and big pay for slow work had,
by making it twice as costly to build as in
former days, brought about steep rents, and
herded two or three families in a cottage.
Of course the Commission is to have a jaunt
to Sydney, where it will presumably take
evidence from the Admiral of the British
squadron.
The demand of Labor, here and in Eng-
land, that there shall be an end of “secret
diplomacy,” touches a responsive chord and
all that sort of thing. Logically one might
go further and denounce secret night marches
or flank movements in war, secret weapons
and secret fortifications. Also secret cau-
cuses. The fact is that hidden diplomacy
is objectionable if the object in view is
objectionable, and open diplomacy is apt to
be ruinous. Thus if a weak and menaced
Power advertises openly for allies, it is
mighty likely to be killed before it gets them.
Gold-mining is a poor industry to subsi-
dise, for a goldfield starts towards its in-
evitable death as soon as it is born, unlike
a farm or factory or sheep-station, which
may go on and improve indefinitely. Yet,
when Acting-Prime Minister Page called in
at Kalgoorlie, the industry wasn’t bashful.
The inevitable deputation wanted freedom
of the industry from income-tax, exemption
of imported machinery from duty, ft per
cent, bonus on all gold won, and that Tas-
mania and the rest of the Commonwealth
should subsidise any bonus that the State
Government might grant. And Page, in-
stead of telling the deputation that he ad-
mired its trackless wastes of cheek, said
the matter would be considered.
J. J. Simons, who left the Westralian
Labor party in 1922 and lost his seat in con-
sequence, has hopes of regaining East Perth
for the Nationalists at Saturday’s election.
Simons was on the staff of De Garis’s Iven-
denup, and Hughes, the sitting Laborite, was
about the keenest critic of that enterprise
before it blew out, so the combatants’
speeches are 10 p.c, politics and 90 p.c.
Ivendenup. Ivanowna is another Labor elec-
torate in which the outlook is doubtful.
Tommy Walker, who was M.L.A. for North-
umberland (N.S.W.) in Parkes’s time, has
held it since 1905, but many of his mining
supporters have gone to other fields, and
there may be enough farmers in the southern
part of the constituency to elect Neville
Heenan, a young Digger-lawyer standing in
the Cocky interest. On the other hand, Labor
talks of wresting Guildford, Fremantle,
Bunbury, Leederville, Menzies and Mount
Margaret from the Gnashers and Sussex from
the Country party.
“0.K.”: The first British Labor Gov-
ernment will at least be remembered
for its commutation of the ancient Rod-
ney pension, which has cost the British
taxpayer £324,000 since 1782. The pen-
sion _ of £2OOO a year to a victorious
admiral was not much to growl about, but
the granting of it to his lineal descendants
was an unlovely example of class legislation.
The grant of £lOO,OOO a year and a house
to the Duke of Wellington and two succeed-
ing _ bearers of the title was due to the
nation’s burst of hysteria after Waterloo,
but there was a defined limit to the bounty.
Though the old Duke drew his £lOO,OOO (and
lost a lot of it at the gaming table) for 37
years, his successors didn’t become old pen-
sioners.
Goodman, manager of Adelaide’s munici-
pally-owned trams, is off round the world
to look into the question of running motor-
’buses for “feeding” purposes. Privately-
owned vehicles are now competing briskly
against the trams on nearly every line; and
while it is realised that something has to
be done, Authority can’t bring itself to
adopt the suggestion of the State’s railway
chief that the right thing to do is to virtu-
ally tax the competitors out of existence.
And it certainly wouldn’t be safe to do it
without first guaranteeing the public that
its own lines would be run on strict busi-
ness principles.
It has been suggested in Britain that the
Rammae Government will bo sent about its
business inside six months. The first Fisher
Government, which took office in November,
1908, lasted six months, and its ejection was
unfortunate (in the sequel, at all events) for
the other side. In that case also Labor
took office in dependence on a third party,
and its leader was a solemn but presentable
Scot. It was defeated by a fusion of Free-
traders and Protectionists, who held office
for 18 months and were then utterly routed
at the polls. If Baldwin’s party is foolish
enough to coalesce with the fading Free-
trade remnant the analogy will very likely
be completed. It was the Protectionist Dis-
raeli who said that “the English do not love
coalitions,” and the same is as true of the
contemporary Briton as it was of his grand-
father and is of the Australian.
“Hathern”: A pumping-machine was
badly wanted in Rabaul. Somebody pro-
voked a howl of indignation by suggesting
that good ones were made in Germany.
Eventually a machine was brought from
England at 50 p.c. increase on the price of
the German article. It worked well, and
officialdom w-as quite pleased with it till one
day the name-plate fell off. Underneath was
the information: “Made in Germany.” It
no doubt comes of our stupid Customs pro
VlSl ™ b - v which goods are British so long
as p.c. of their value has been added to
them in Britain. In this case, probably, the
article got a coat of paint there.
The Seamen’s Union is now voting on the
question of affiliating with the A.L.P. If
the Ayes have it, the mariners will dominate
the pre-selection ballots for Melbourne Ports
and West Sydney. Controlling 8000 votes,
they could make either electorate a gift for
Comrade Tom Walsh, if he cared to accept
it; and though Thomas professes to despise
jd™ 1 amentary institutions, the chance of
±lOOO a year and a safe seat is not to be
lightly scorned.
The Federal Public Works Committee got
hold of the Commonwealth engineer for
works and railways, and asked him whether
he thought Canberra should be connected
with the main line at Yass by railway or
whether a concrete road would do. The de-
spondent man said the present dirt high-
way, 43 miles long, would be a good enough
approach, with a few improvements, for some
time to come. Enthusiasm about ’Berra oh
the road to nowhere, is at a low ebb.
between rival organisations of
JN.fe.W. Government railwaymen has been
raging in the Sydney Labor daily. Buckley
the A.R.U. secretary, began it by asserting
that ; the Railway and Tramway Officers’
Association is really a branch of the Nation-
alist party and that “it is therefore no
wonder that the salaried officers are anxious
to join the A.R.U., which supports the
Labor party.” Hunt, the R. and T. O. man,
replied that his association, so far from be-
ing a branch of the National Federation,
was strictly non-political, and that its mem-
bei's wouldn’t think of joining the A.R.U.
and being -‘dominated by wages-men whose
interests do not coincide with their own ”
1 nmns of Government workmen have been
allowed to take part in politics, and it is pro-
too late to cancel the privilege. But
it isn t too late to protect the rights of indi-
vidual members wdio may object to be tied to
a political party. Without intending it
uckley has furnished very good arguments
for the segregation of the Government-
employee vote.
THE WHY OF IT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“French newspapers continue to advance all sorts
of reasons for the fall of the franc.”
"The thing that has me guessing,” said the franc
unto the pound,
“Is how you keep your wicket up while I am banged
and downed,
Till some five score of me or more it takes with
you to rank.”
“Oh, it’s none so hard to answer,” said the sovereign
to the franc.
“J. Bull to ledger-squaring set when once the war
was won ;
He didn’t count on what might be extracted from the
Hun.
He put his khaki togs away, and ceased his sword
to clank,
And faced the situation,” said the sovereign to the
franc.
"He taxed himself and pinched himself the bills lie
owed to pay,
Postponing what he might collect until another day.
He set his teeth and met his obligations to the Yank
(Incurred for you, mon ami),” said the sovereign
to the franc.
“In shell-torn towns and war-swept fields for victory
you paid,
And he in ruined industries and devastated trade.
B ith millions on the dole, mayhap the bitterer cup
he drank,
But never sought to dodge it,” said the sovereign
to the franc.
“He framed his Budgets honestly, to lift his load he
strained ;
To cling to wild, fallacious hopes he sturdily dis-
dained.
For Chauvinistic enterprise and military swank
To Bull are maranatha,” said the sovereign to the
franc.
“Tou see, he’s just a matter-of-fact and plodding sort
of gent.,
Quite lacking in your volatile, mercurial tempera-
ment ;
So why not take a leaf from us, and cease on
dreams to bank,
If you want your fall arrested?” said the sovereign
to the franc.

On no other occasion since the N. S. Wales
Parliament fixed a standard rate of dividend
has the 8 p.c. been so easily earned as in the
past half-year. Disclosed net profits were
more than one-fourth as large again as the
amount required for shareholders, but as the
returns for the June term fell far short of
div. requirements the surplus on this occasion
lias done little more than make good the pre-
vious term’s deficiency. However, that state-
ment accepts without qualification the net
profits as presented by the directors; and
there are qualifications. The Gas Act per-
mits a lay-by annually of an amount equal
to 31 p.c. on total expenditure on works,
etc., for depreciation and “special purposes.”
Almost £4,400,000 has been invested in the
undertaking, so nearly £154,000 can be re-
served each year until a maximum of 10 p.c.
(£440.000) has been reached. Votes to this
fund have varied widely:—

In addition to the larger cuts for de-

for the past half-year have been affected
by abnormally heavy expenditure on
repairs and maintenance of works, plant,
etc. The figures are shown in the last line

One way and another Sydney’s principal
gas co. found conditions much easier during
the past six months than it had in .almost
any other half-year since it came under Gov-
ernment control. The growth of some of the
figures must, of course, be considered in rela-
tion to the rapid expansion of the business.
Compared with only five years ago there is
£2,760,000 of capital employed against
£1.530,000, and debentures and temporary
loans tot up £1,547,378 compared with
£1,442,500 in December, 1918. The total
outlay on works, etc., now runs into
£4,399,269; in 1918 it was £3,096,508. So
rapid lias been the growth of Sydney that,
despite electric competition, 5611 new con-
sumers went on the books during tlie six
months covered by the latest accounts, and
they and industrial expansion lifted the con-
sumption to 3104 b million feet, an in-
crease of 10.1 p.c. on the figures tor the
December half of 1922. This development
of the business, however, cannot bo expected
to improve divs. Under the Act they are
practically restricted to 8 P-c. p.a. on paid
capital, though there is one way m which a
fractional increase might be made—-that is.
if the directors had the pluck to face the
public outcry which would inevitably follow.
The amended Act, which removed some or
the anomalies in the original Carmichael
measure, did not disturb the sliding-scale
which had been provided for divs. should
the price be reduced below the ‘‘standard,
which then was 3s. 6d. per 1000 ft. Seem-
ingly that sliding scale still applies to the
standard rate provided under the later Act,
which rate was raised on several occasions
when the co. applied to the court for permis-
sion to increase its selling charges to counter-
act increased costs of production. The original
Act said that the cos. could distribute an
extra | p.c. for every penny reduction in
the standard price which had been in force
12 months. The Court was last appealed to
towards the end of 1920, and it fixed the
price at ss. 9d. Several voluntary reductions
have since been made: in May next one of
Id. will have operated for two years, and in
August 2d. more for the same period, and a
further 2d. reduction has operated for nearly
15 months. That drop of sd. wrnuld, pre-
sumably, allows 1] p.c. more p.a. to be added
to divs. However, the directors would be
ill-advised to attempt any div. increase; such
a move might succeed once, but. as Parliament
has definitely laid it down that 8 p.c. is a
fair return on capital invested in a
public utility, the directors might be
bitten by the sleeping dogs which would be
awakened. The method of control in N. S.
Wales, Melbourne might note, has proved
thoroughly satisfactory to both the public
and shareholders. The one serious weakness
in the N. S. Wales Act is that a cO. is under
no obligation to run its affairs on economical
lines ; and there is certainly no incentive for it
to do so. That is an aspect which the Vie.
; Government might consider in the Gas Act
which it will probably introduce to regulate
the Metropolitan Co. of Melbourne. If a co.
can definitely establish its claim that it is
making extra by exceptionally good'manage-
ment and from improved retorting practice
and by squeezing the last penny from by-
products, there is no reason why share-
holders as w r ell as consumers should not
benefit. In fact, they ought to. It would
encourage them to be both progressive and
economical.

The performances of this co. show how
anticipations can go agley. It was floated
in 1910 to buy a ramshackle pub and adjoin-
ing residences on Manly's ocean-front, and
replace them bv a modern residential hotel.
Capital was £35,000 —it has not altered
since—and the promoters reckoned on a
profit of £7400 after providing fully for
depreciation and taxes. They could not, of
course, foresee a w r orld-w T ar, a 'flu-epidemic,
liquor-trade restrictions and higher costs
and taxes. So, though the site w r as bought
before land values soared, and though con-
struction was completed before building-
costs increased so enormously, profits have
been only a shadow’ of the estimate, and
shareholders have had an average of only a
trifle more than 5 p.c. In recent years,
though, substantial amounts have been laid
aside to strengthen the co., which has done-
much better than the 8 p.c. divs. suggest.
The past 32 months were the best so far;
the £6618 shown after providing for repairs,
renewals and taxation was almost 19 p.c.
on capital, and only £BOO short of the re-
turn expected by the promoters when pub-
running w r as much easier.
Shareholders have had 10 p.c. for the
year, and at December 31 last the co.’s posi-
tion had improved in this way:—
1913. 1918. 1922. 1923.

Buildings, etc. . . 56,934 56,161 60,141 60,133
Since the beginning the directors have em-
ployed £20,000 of debentures, and apart
from them liabilities in 10 years have been
reduced from £10,225 to £6075. While
floating debt has thus been curtailed by
£4150. the book value of liquid assets has
grown £7635. and £3199 (net) has been
added to the hotel and equipment. bo
shareholders have seen the enterprise nicely
strengthened during the period of a low-
average div. rate. Deducting last year s
final div., deposits and cash tell only £looo
short of all trading (most of
which, of course, were not due) and taxa-
tion commitments, and that was backed by
£3446 of stocks and £2254 of book debts,
etc. Provided no large outlay is required
for renewals, and the business continues to
prosper, it won’t be long before the direc-
tors can reduce the fixed debt. The posi-
tion generally is very comfortable, and the
earning of divs. has been made much easier
by hoarding profits.

Mangrovite’s position six months ago was
not quite so good as the accounts sug-
gested; £3257 of the reserves shown at
June 30 last, together witli £lOOO earned
last half-year, have been laid aside for taxes,
atid the surplus of reserves over and above
goodwill items has fallen to £1026. Profits
for the past six months w r ere much below
t he recent average; the amount disclosed,
after making provision for taxes, just met
to a penny the usual 10 p.c. to shareholders.
The published accounts are not illuminative;
one entry alone records the net profit for the
half-year, so shareholders are not told how
turnover and exes, behaved. The export
trade has been satisfactory, the directors
say, but competition in local markets has
been “keener than ever,” and wages went
higher on two occasions during the period.
Nevertheless, as the directors propose to
make extensions to both warehouse and
factory, things are, perhaps, not quite so blue
as Clias. Ludowici pictures them. Share-
holders were offered 12,619 new shares—one
for seven. Here are some comparisons going
back to the 1920 reconstruction, when a
one-in-three gift issue was handed out: —

There have been no balance-sheet movements
of any consequence lately, the few thousands
increase of liabilities being represented on the
other side by larger stocks and book debts.
Against £7OOB of outside debt and £4257
set ajside for taxation were liquid assets with
a book value of £51,003, and the liquid
surplus was equal to almost 9s. per share.
The balance-sheet shows tangible? assets to
cover the balance; the £6732 of patent-rights
and trade-marks taken into the books in the
1920 reconstructiori has been covered by
profits accumulated, with the £lOOO-odd
shown in the introductory table to spare.

Revenue xvas down a little on the year and
exes, were up, but the 20 p.c. divs. which
have been paid since the last capitalisation
of reserves were not threatened. In some
respects that rate is misleading; it is pos-
sible only because of the heavy writing-
dow-n of capital when assets were re-valued
after the Melbourne land boom crashed.
One-half of the old scrip was cancelled,
and on the £20,000 left 5 p.c. was the best
the co. could manage for many years. Share-
holders who bought in during the depression
are, of course, on an excellent wicket, and
their investment has been made sweeter by
the splendid opportunity given them lately
of taking up a new issue at par. A few
years ago the co. purchased the adjoining
Wrixon building, and on portion of the un-
used land included in that property the
directors now propose to erect a build-
ing providing accommodation for 120 more
boarders. They offered 58,500 new shares
of 10s. —one for every two —and as the
latest sale of the IQs. paids was 255. 6d.
shareholders were invited to a great feast.
Whether the 20 p.c. divs. cau be maintained
ou capital half as large again is for the
future to show; but it seems too much to
expect. How income and outgo have be-
haved during the past 10 years is shown
next: —

Last year the directors became a little con-
cerned about the falling-off in catering re-'
ceipts, and a new chef was installed with
the hope of effecting a recovery in that diffi-
cult branch of the business.
The new capital will not cover the outlay
contemplated on construction and equipment
of the new building; the new issue will
bring in £29,250, and approximately £40,000
will be required. Excepting £2OOO of Gov-
ernment bonds, the co. has very little
in hand to pay for the balance, so the
mortgage account will swell. At the pre-
sent the co. is working on a £15,000 mort-
gage, and £12.000 of the. purchase price of
Wrixon’s building is still outstanding. Here

Cash was cut into last year to pay £3OOO
off the Wrixon account. Generally the busi-
ness has been very snug for many years,
and it is a compliment to the management,
which has no hard tipples to attract custom
or to help earnings, that the directors con-
sider it good business to increase accom-
modation.

Patakalana Cotton Estates, Ltd
This co. is being floated in Sydney
with a nominal capital of £50,000 to
take over the balance of the 99 years’ lease
of 2000 acres of Crown lands on the Kemp
Welch River, 58 miles east of Moresby, for-
merly held bv Commercial Timbers (Papua),
Ltd., now in liquidation. That coneirn
spent £lO,OOO on clearing ; and for the estates
and equipment, including a small steamer
and a launch, caterpillar-tractor, sawmill and
boiler, etc., on all of which £7530 was spent,
and also as their consideration for introduc-
ing the proposition, the promoters, the Papuan
Cotton Exploitation Syndicate, ask £16,000
of fully-paid ordinaries and £2OOO cash.
The public is offered £17,000 of prefs., pre-
ferential as to capital and as to divs. of
12J p.c. cumulative, with rights to follow
ordinaries to 15 p.c., and also £17,000 of
ordinary shares. The prospectus declares
that both land and climate are suited
for cotton-growing, and emphasises two
features of the venture: (1) the
whole 2000 acres has been cleared and
grubbed, and is therefore ready for grass-
burning, ploughing and planting; and
eight native villages are within a 10-miles
radius, and a population of approximately
2000 is available for drawing upion for labor.
Incidentally, “special provision has been
made by the Government for the employ-
ment of native women and children as
casual labor for picking.” The promoters
expect £9600 to cover all capital outlay,
including their cash consideration and pre-
liminary exes, and brokerage. The cost of
planting 1000 acres in the first year, and of
harvesting, freighting and ginning an esti-
mated production of 267.0001 b. cotton lint
is reckoned at £7382. On that figuring,
which is said to allow liberally for contin-
gencies, the promoters expect good profits
from planting the first 1000 acres. The co.
proposes to do its own ginning, and profit
estimates are based on cotton lint at
17d. per lb., equal to approximately
sfd. per lb., seed cotton. The vital
point in these cotton floats, however,
just as it was in tl*e rubber floats, is not
what the market price will be this year or
next, but what it will be years ahead.

Is. 1.6 d., and “it is necessary to obtain at
least Is. 6d. per lb. to show profits while the
present debenture interest is being paid.”
They mature about September, 1926, and
everything depends on happenings during the
next couple of years whether it will be pos-
sible to obtain cheaper money, or, perhaps,
even renew the loan on current oppressive
terms. With most of the world’s rubber
estates still operating under a system of
restricted outputs, so that prices can be arti-
ficially maintained at a profitable level, the
outlook for smaller plantations on which
costs cannot be cut, and particularly those
which are burdened with costly debt, is very
doubtful. For the 12 months to December 31
the Domara showed a working profit of
£747 from rubber, and 93 tons copra weighed
in with £76S of profit. But though £2ll of
Federal taxes were refunded, after £l4OO
debenture interest had been paid and small
office and general exes, and depreciation had
been charged, the period closed with a loss
of £534, making the total debit £3892. Direc-
tors have drawn no fees for three years;
including accrued fees, liabilities, apart from
the debenture debt, totted up £1235. On the
other side were stocks of produce, stores,
book debts and cash totalling £2311. Paid
capital is £29,666.

The 12-years-old Co-operative Assurance
Co., of Sydney, proposes to go out of life
business altogether. A few months back it
sold its Industrial branch to the Common-
wealth General; now it proposes to sell all
Ordinary and Accident business to the Aus-
tralian Provincial. In a circular to share-
holders and policy-holders, the Board
announces that under the provisions of the
Co-operation, Community Settlement and
Credit Act, recently passed in N. S.
Wales, thei co. is, after one year, “debarred
from carrying on its business under its pre-
sent constitution,” and that the Act makes
it “impossible to secure freedom from the
disabilities” imposed. Incidentally, larger
deposits demanded by the Queensland Gov-
ernment, which are alleged to be a “menace
to the co.’s present and future prospects”
there, and “otlie ; r pending legislation in N.
S. Wales and Victoria” are also declared to
have influenced the decision to put up the
shutters.
But there’s more in it than that. The N.
S. Wales Act was not designed to drive the
co. out of business, nor are the Queensland
measures so penalising as to prevent opera-
tions there. Bluntly, it seems that the
Co-operative has wearied of the struggle to
build up a life business —probably, it couldn’t
see any money in the business for this
generation of shareholders. The sale of
Industrial assurances a few months ago in-
dicated that in that branch the Co-operative
management had despaired of building up a
sound, profitable connection in the face of
the concessions offered by younger competi-
tors—which, by the way, cannot afford to
offer a ha’p’orth of concessions. In the
Ordinary branch, the Co-op.’s affairs have
been decidedly easier than in most other
youthful offices. An actuarial investigation
as at September 30 last disclosed a small
surplus of funds over the amount required
for policy liabilities. However, the business
is far too small to give much promise of find-
ing divs. for £91,379 of capital in addition
to bonuses for policy-holders, and managing-
director James Inch has had the experience
to teach him that it is quite problematic
whether, under existing conditions in the life
field, sufficient additional business can be
won at a cost which can show profits within
a reasonable period.
The Co-op.’s Ordinary business is carrying
approximately £33,000 of premiums per
annum, and Accident £6OOO. The price
which is being paid by the A.P.A. has not
been disclosed. Co-op. shareholders are to
meet on April 14 to arrange the obsequies.

New Guinea Copper has given its sup-
porters a nasty jolt. Erie Huntley “regrets
that efficient machinery for furnace blast
has not been provided,” and the announce-
ment is interpreted as an admission of fail-
ure to fulfil the promise of a year ago that,
with £78,000 spent on plant, ore could be
treated to give 255 tons copper and 7500 z.
gold monthly. To have a smelter without
efficient blast is like having a Town Hall
organ without the bellows. The co. has
290,000 tons ore to work upon, and as Hunt-
ley says he must have an efficient blowing
engine h£ will have to get it. His news is
a knock-out for Collins House, which ex-
presses its “surprise and disappointment,”
and says'that the matter is being given “the
most serious consideration.” That isn’t con-
solation for the buyer of scrip at 355. who
clung on : while the £78,000 was being called
up. Cecil Budd, the big gun of the British
Metals Corporation, which took a fly at the
scrip in ’ one of the reconstructions, is in
Melbourne, and so is able to pick up the
Collins House expressions of surprise and
disappointment. Evidently a specialist has
been called in to report on treatment: hints
are given that the ore needs a pre-roast and
sintering plant to obtain smooth and un-
interrupted operations. This work may be
done without adding much to running costs,
but the plant will require time and money to
instal, and meanwhile other methods will
probably be tried.

Two quiet funerals were lately announced
in the N.S.W. Government Gazette —a
notice proclaimed the end of the once con-
siderable municipalities of Hillgrove and
Wrightville. When Baker’s Creek and the
other mines in the vicinity flourished, Hill-
grove threatened to outshadow Armidale.
Wrightville faded when the dark shadows
fell on Cobar.

An interesting co., the Commonwealth
Mining, Finance and Development Co., Ltd.,
is being formed in Sydney. Its field is a big
one: the prospectus contemplates
an organisation efficiently equipped, both techni-
cally and professionally, to investigate and, where
thought fit, to act as a medium for financing selected
mining and ore propositions from among those
constantly presenting themselves in Australia, and
which under existing conditions mainly rely for
their patronage upon individual promoters and small
financiers, with the attendant risks of exploitation
from purely speculative motives.
The proposition is introduced by T. W.
Ivimber, who has had “varied experi-
ence in company and mining finance,”
principally in S. Aus. For the first Board
mining-engineers Geo. H. Blakemore and W.
Poole, and G. R. W. McDonald, M.L,C., and
Chas. Baker, late manager of the Bank of
N. S. Wales at Charters Towers, have signed
on. It is proposed to appoint a competent
mining man to make all preliminary investi-
gations of propositions offered —the “Wild
Cat” would not care for his job of sorting
out all the duds with which he is certain to
be deluged from every corner of the Com-
monwealth—and when prospecting and
development warrant the co. will sponsor
flotations. Profits are expected from (1)
developmental operations; (2) share inter-
ests and divs. from cos. floated; (3) com-
missions and profits on purchase and sales
of ores (the co. proposes to engage in this
branch of the metals business) ; and (4)
commission on supplies of machinery and
plant. It is a scheme of possibilities if con-
trolled by reputable experts, but the gamble
is in the prospect of the co. being introduced
to a fair proportion of winners. The co. is
in 50,000 shares of £1 each, and 20,000 are
offered for subscription. The weakness in
the float is the gift of 5000 fully-paids to
the promoting parties; that is a one-fifth
interest and top-heavy considering that they
really have nothing but a well-worn idea
to dispose of. At the best the promoters
are entitled only to deferred shares, their
dividends being contingent upon the earning
of something extra-good in the way of pro-
fits.

Manager Rolfe, of the Crown, Bombandy
Mountain, near Mudgee (N.S.W.), has
issued a plan of the mine workings, and a
study of them explains why contributing
shares paid to 6s. 6d. are at a heavy dis-
count. The co. was floated in May last
year, and at least two months more must
elapse before the 10-head battery will talk.
Unproductive tunnels punched into a barren
hillside at long distances from the gold have
absorbed much cash. The northern (No. 1)
tunnel was stopped at 148 ft. According to
the plans 200 ft. more driving will be neces-
sary to reach quartz. No. 2, to the south,
is in such an oblique position that at
178 ft. it is still a long way from the
“C” reef, unless the underlay has had a
twist. The “C” reef enrichment appears to
be shallow, and the gold could have been
followed down from the surface at less cost.
All the recent outlay on development has not
added much to whatever promise was shown
in shallow workings and by early prospect-
ing. The Crown has still a long way to go
to prove itself a decent-sized mine.

Hawkin’s Hill, alias Marshall’s Hill End
(N.S.W.), had another of its periodical
flutters last week. After having collapsed
to 4|d., scrip rushed to Is. 9d. in a few days.
A crushing of 28 tons picked ore brought in
£325, and staved off the March and April
calls. Manager Mclntyre, who is retiring,
records the appearance of gold-bearing stone
in the end of the drive from the No. 1 north
winze at the 800 ft. level, and he puts value
on the find because it is going underfoot. A
circular to shareholders announces that E.
R. Cock, who was associated with the late
Jack Scantlebury in better days at Hill End,
is taking charge.
* * * *
Christmas Gift (N.S.W.) has returned to
the fold with 90 tons giving 640 z. Fifty
tons come from the winze below the 200 ft.
level, and 40 tons from a short crosscut at
the same level, where a block of ore 35ft.
long by 3ft. wide was located. Cootamun-
dra has not lost all faith in the disappoint-
ing show.
If present intentions are adhered to,
Moruya, the little N. S. Wales South Coast
town, will occupy a dominating position in
the Sydney landscape when the North Shore
bridge is completed. It is proposed to obtain
the granite for the huge towers —if they
are built—from that district. But if
Moruya is to get a good advt., the contrac-
tors will need to take care that the material
is free from iron-pyrites, which, when they
oxidise, are liable to make a botch of the
best work in granite.
Mt. Tumblong Development (N.S.W.),
floated with great gusto a few weeks ago,
isn’t going to develop at all. A. P. Penman
has had another look, and costeens and a
shaft sunk to 45ft. have disclosed sufficient
for him to pronounce the proposition worth-
less. The innards of Mt. Tumblong prove
to be a jumble of dyke formations, with
decomposed slate, quartz and pipeclay inter-
mixed in unending confusion.
Judged on gold outputs of the past 12
months, Kalgoorlie gives little hope of any
considerable divs. in the future. The average
grade of outputs is now about 40s. per ton,
and allowing for developmental costs, plant
renewals and other items of expenditure not
usually shown on monthly statements, it is
not possible to treat ore much under that.
Boulder Perseverance yield for February
showed a big falling-off in grade compared
with returns when tributors had the mine to
themselves. Manager Williams, when taking
control last year, promised great things as a
result of “working the property by usual
methods,” but evidently he has had to sacrifice
grade for tonnage, with the inevitable re-
sult. He now offers to let further tributes
to working parties, provided there are no
sleeping partners, official or otherwise, stand-
ing in with them as formerly. Working
costs hhve been reduced a little, but there
is nothing showing to justify shareholders
in expecting much in divs.

Freney Oil (W.A.) lias had trouble lately
owing to the collapse of the bore-hole walls.
The reason given why the first hole put down
by the Calyx drill stood up, and the adjacent
second one, drilled by percussion, is falling
in, is that the porous beds through which
the latter is now passing have been rendex*ed
friable by the percolation of water from the
first bore. Superintendent Talbot reckons
that the present bore is about to strike more
compact country, and that difficulties will
then be overcome.

Shareholders in Mount Slienton, run by a
Perth co., are anxiously awaiting informa-
tion as to the r6sults of sinking a winze on
their show 80 miles from Laverton. At 60ft.
down, the winze was reported to carry 3ft.
of ore going soz. Last month the directors
despatched a manager and miners with in-
structions to make or break the mine as
quickly as possible.
Most Bendigo mines have reached the
stage when they would be glad to discover
even one shoot of gold. In the Hercules,
however, the big centre reef appears to be
developing a third shoot, no less, at the
1475 ft. level about 500 ft. north. The main
shoot in this reef is above the 1380 ft. level,
and has been mainly responsible for the pro-
fitable results of the last five months. This
shoot was entered a little south of the shaft
and has so far extended about 100 ft. north,
and is probably over 40ft. high. Having a
north pitch it should be showing in the
1380 ft. north level; but the stone there is
poor. Still, though the gold-bearing shoot is
evidently short, there is a very fair quantity of
payable stone at once available. The second
shoot is being developed below the 1520 ft.
level at 500 ft. north. Here an extra depth
of the reef has developed below the bottom
of the main reef proper, and has been opened
up by a winze 70ft. deep, with drives 50ft.
north and 50ft. south from the bottom of
the winze, which was still in stone. Crush-
ings from the winze and drives have averaged
about an ounce. In the south drive values
have fallen off, but there is no lack of stone.
Attention is being focussed on this drive, as
many hold the opinion that the quartz will
extend back to the shaft and will be cut by
the 1620 ft. main crosscut now going out. A
trial from the 1475 ft. level at 500 ft. north
gave lldwt. where it connected with a rise,
from near the top of which a trial had pre-
viously given 15dwt., indicating a third shoot
which may take up the running should the
1380 ft. shoot fail. Between these two shoots
there are considerable possibilities in the
350 ft. of reef that remains to be cut up.
There is also promise further north in the
1520 ft. level and in the new 1620 ft. level.
* * * *
Morning Star, Wood’s Point (Vic.),
skidded badly in the last six months: ore
dropped from 30dwt. to 15dwt. grade, and
as this gold is worth only 70s. per oz. returns
are very close to the costs mark. Of course,
if the mine could provide work on a big
scale, a recovery might be made and fossick-
ing continued until a new floor could be ex-
posed. Progressive work south at 500 ft. and
developments at 700 ft. have brought to light
fair supplies of ore, but mountain shoots, as
a rule, when in diorite, are erratic in size
and gold contents, and Morning Star aver-
ages have been no exception to the general
experience. As no big body of stone is
proved in the upper levels, the future mostly
depends on the extension of operations at
800 ft. Scrip is. still treated with respect by
brokers; the lesson of the A 1 bear squeeze
has not been lost on them.
The Queensland Government persists in
hanging on to the full area of the Petroleum
Reserve north of Roma, so a couple of cos.
are making arrangements to bore the coun-
try to the north of Mitchell, just outside of
the State area. Dr. Jensen has selected
sites where structure is considered favor-
able, and where the gas horizons of the Wal-
loons are likely to be pierced at less than
2500 ft. A Brisbane co. is likely to have the
services of Arthur Moore, who was at Roma
and recently put in several months working
on Californian fields. It is probable that
the Australian Oil Corporation will try its
luck in the same locality, the consensus of
geological opinion being dead against Beau-
desert, which the A.O.C. first fancied.

Queensland gold returns for February
reached 74130 z. (fine) worth £31,438, an in-
crease of 1650 z. on February, 1923. An
analysis of the individual fields shows that
they all failed badly except the old stand-by,
Mount Morgan. Mount Coolon, really the
only promising field in the State at the
moment, did not have a crushing. It will be
heard of during March, as recent rains filled
the dams.

“No luck, Egbert—absolutely empty — it's full of water."
“Hasen”: He was an Englishman anrl
proud of it, a colonel and looked it; even his
supplementary distinctions didn’t appear to
worry him. His deck-chair bore in four-
inch letters the full legend “Colonel Bull,
0.8. E.” He owned a large manner, monocle,
wife and voice, and a small vocabulary in
which he sadly overworked one word- —‘rot-
ten.” That was his concise opinion of all
of the universe not bounded by the English
Channel and the Cheviot Hills. He had
travelled almost to Australia by way of
France, Italy, Egypt, Singapore and Java,
and had seen nothing that warranted any
variation of this criticism. And his gloom
was far-reaching. It overshadowed Aus-
tralia from a distance of 2000 miles. He
knew that the hotels, streets, theatres and
sunsets out there were rotten. And the
place was full of bad wine and labor
troubles. It was at this point that Collis
unwound some of his Bananaland lankiness
and spoke. Collis was homing after four
years of exile in the Malay States, and his
heart was soft within him, so he did not
speak harshly. He said: “There’s one thing
that should strike you about the Australian,
Colonel.” “That so,” boomed the Colonel;
“and what?” “His wonderful restraint,
murmured Collis, and softly departed. “Well,”
began the Colonel expansively, ‘ I never
knew”.... And then suddenly he grew’
silent —and pink. Which shows, I suppose,
that most hides are more or less penetrable.

“.T.8.H.”: “Billy Cann” asks how it
was that Prime Minister Bruce was able to
ride about Anzac on a horse left behind by
the A.L.H. (B. 13/3/’24). When the Armis-
tice came, a force of Australians and Maori-
landers from the Anzac Mounted Division
was sent to occupy the Peninsula. The 7th
A.L.H. and the Canterbury Mounted Bides
were the regiments chosen ; they landed with
English troops on Gallipoli early in Decem-
ber, 1918, taking their neddies with them.
Details were left behind with the Graves
party when the Anzacs were withdrawn, and
these kept their horses.

Les Robinson’s fable of the Strong Man
and the Dogs :
One freezing day a professional strong man, who
was fast losing confidence in the supremacy of his
physique, saw from his bedroom window a dog walk-
ing reflectively and without shivering across a frozen
lake.
“Alas!” he exclaimed. “All my advertisements
call me ‘the strong,’ yet here is a beast that, in its
natural covering, walks slowly upon ice, without
experiencing the slightest inconvenience apparently,
while I lie in bed, clad in an overcoat, underneath the
down quilt, and still suffer discomfort from the
temperature.”
From that day forth he resolved to consort entirely
with dogs, imagining that by doing so he would in
time acquire their capacity for tolerating extremes
of heat and cold. He bought an assorted pack of
hounds, and, divesting himself of all clothing, which
was lawful in that country, he set out to acquire
canine habits and customs.
Scavenging with the dogs all night, and becoming
impounded with them by day, being careful as well
to eat from the same garbage-tins and always to
drink gutter water, it was not long before the
physical culturist became so ill that he was obliged
to visit a veterinary surgeon.
Perceiving instantly that he had mange so badly
that he was a menace to all the expensive dogs in
the locality, the surgeon had him removed to a
lethal chamber and destroyed.
There was great joy when his canine associates
heard of his asphyxiation, for somehow or other he
had failed to induce them to revere him.
Moral: Even if dogs are our superiors, we should
never permit them to suspect it.

“Bouragi”: It isn’t only in war-time that
patrician spirits may be crushed by being
cut off from tooth powder and mutton cut-
lets (B. 21/2/’24). I was at the R.M.’s
house at Old Tamata, on the Mambare, m
Papua, when Governor le Hunte and his
entourage suddenly descended
on us. The gloomiest
crowd was a young Eng-
lander, who had abandoned
a sub-lieutenant’s job in the
Navy to become one of the
Governor’s secretaries, and
who confided to me over
drinks that his profound de-
jection was due to the omis-
sion of porridge from the
early breakfast the party had
eaten before leaving Mamba
beach to come up the river.
He added that, though he
liad never breakfasted with-
out porridge in his life be-
fore, his complaints had been
received in the worst possible
spirit. But a harder trial
was to come for him. The
R.M. had killed one of his
precious goats as a special
delicacy for his guests’ din-
ner, and my young friend's
horror and disgust reached
their zenith when he was
offered some of the dish, un-
camouflaged. He refused
with withering scorn, dining off one of the
rubber-pigeons of the locality. I heard later
that he had resigned on returning to Port
and departed for less debased localities.
“J.W.F.” : You want to know about quaint
crimes on A.I.F. charge sheets? Well, I
possess one of these documents with the
entry: “Conduct prejudicial to the good
order and discipline of the A.1.F., in that
he was found in Weymouth, his arm round
a young woman’s waist.” Originally the
entry read “lady’s waist,” but it was crossed
out and “woman’s” inserted. Somebody evi-
dently had a second guess as to what she
was. Anyhow, it added up to seven days’
C.B.
“Nimshi” : Some months ago three southern
youths announced their intention of walking
around Australia, and, procuring a map,
they set off smartly along the hard road.
They carried swags, of course, but disdained
the term “swaggie”—they were “pedestrian
tourists.” Everyone they met heard all
about their plans, and soon the papers along
their route began to publish sympathetic
items about their progress—“At one stage
the lads were entirely without sugar” ; “One
of the adventurous trio lost his socks cross-
ing Cockeye Creek,” and so on. As they
fared farther north these little amenities
HIS HEART'S DESIRE.
“I could face death dancing with you.”
“You probably will if my husband sees you.”
became less frequent, and they found them-
selves coldly ignored, if not regarded with
suspicion. The climax came at Cairns the
other day, when an utterly matter-of-fact
magistrate handed them a month apiece for
not being able to show visible means of sup-
port, and seemed to think they’d thank him
for it in a few years’ time.

“F.S.” : The article on “Modern Times and
Mediawal Universities” (B. 17/l/’24) sets
me thinking of the great changes the last
few years have worked in Oxford. Indeed,
Oxford has largely ceased to be English.
An American, till quite recently, was presi-
dent of the Union. An Oxford eight was
captained by a Harvard graduate. Balliol.
that drab college which reminds a visitor of
a station hotel, contains the intelligentsia
oi the Orient. University College is full of
Americans and Chinese. Even the “House”
(Christ Church), that former stronghold of
the peerage, has its complement of Yanks
and Celestials. The lead-
ing literary journal of the
University is edited by an
American: you can read the
euphemisms and slang of
Harvard there. The inevit-
able result of Oxford hav-
ing become cosmopolitan is
that it is losing its best and
finest characteristics. Large
numbers of public-school
boys, of course, still come to
Oxford. But the great
schools no longer throttle
the true functions of the
University with their purely
muscular outlook on life;
the influx of boys from the
secondary and council
schools has created at atmo-
sphere more in keeping with
the present century. The
brilliant young men from
the secondary schools have
neither the ' time nor the
means to indulge in sport;
the sporting aristocrat is in
a minority. The tendency
is, therefore, for the modern
undergraduate to seek his
recreation in clubs, mostly
political; the Buskin con-
tains 170 members. But
there are features less satis-
factory. The superfluity of Rahab at Ox-
ford is a menace to youth. True, a Univer-
sity “police” exists, but it is not effective.
Dons are not good policemen. And the “bull-
dogs” are not so fearsome as their name sug-
gests. They are relics of the age to which
“Modern Times and Mediaeval Universities”
referred.
“Morob”: No official statement has ever
been made concerning the loss of the Aus-
tralian submarine AEI, sunk off Duke
of York Island, near Rabaul, in 1914. She
may have hit a reef, but a version that
found more favor in Rabaul was that a
party of Germans secured an auxiliary
schooner and laid in wait for the sub., which
they sank with a gun that had been
hidden somewhere
in the bush ever
since the Austra-
]i a n occupation.
Afterwards they
ran the schooner
ashore just below
Ilerbertsliohe a n d
set fire to it,
making their way
back to the town by
road. The names
of certain German
residents were
whispered in con-
nection with the
matter, and several
days later three of
these men were
arrested suddenly
on unspecified
charges and kept
under- a strong
military guar d
until they left for
the internment camp
a t Holdsworthy.
Moreover, soon
after the submarine
disappeared the re-
mains of a schooner
destroyed by fire
were found by
natives near Her-
bertshohe —as Ko-
poko was then
ca 11 e d —and re-
ported to some mis-
sionaries, who in
turn notified Ra-
baul; and a search
of the neighbor-
hood in which the
schooner had been
beached brought to
light a number of
empty petrol-tins
and a wickerwork
basket, Subse-
quently identified as being of the type used
iii the German Navy for the carriage of
shells for guns. Altogether it is no wonder
that the story found a deal of credence.

“Jeames”: Sydney’s Union Club would
have been well pleased if the original scheme
to obviate the Hunter-Elizabeth street death-
trap had come off. It contemplated the re-
sumption of the entire property. The Club
has just spent £30,000 on an enlarged
smoking-room, automatic lift and other im-
provements, but would not be averse to going
elsewhere on decent terms. Rates and taxes
are enormous, and though candidates are
plentiful they do not use the place, when
elected, as their fathers did. Like all city
clubs in these days of motor-cars, the Union
is being ousted, except as a luncheon resort,
by the golf clubs, some of which offer almost
as good accommodation and much better air.
The alternative scheme will take over the
club’s old-fashioned wooden billiard-room
and an unused part of the garden. Under

GWENDOLIN: “My mind, is made up. Our engagement

GWENDOLEN : “Well, for your credit's sake I’ll bring an
action for breach of promise.”
this arrangement a 90ft. road will then run
from Phillip-street past the Club’s back door,
functioning with the present Hunter-
Elizabeth street loop, and still further send-
ing the rates up against the clubmen, in addi-
tion to introducing the roar of the trams
to the holy quiet of their card-room.

THE MEET,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I ’ung about the Bee’ive till the clocks was striking
eight,
A-wondering if I’d bought a blinkin’ pup ;
Then, tripping sweetly to me, she chirped “I’m
awf’ly late,
But comp’ny makes a lot o’ washin’-up.”
Dressed in the ’eight of fashion, ’er lovely arms was
bare
(I never ’ad a nearthly from the start) ;
And floatin’ on ’er fore’ead was a tiny tuft of ’air
That dropped its little anchor in me ’eart.
We took the tram to ’Enley and nestled on the sand;
A narf-full moon went sailing o’er the sea,
And carried by a zephyr came the music of the
band—
The dreamy, ’aunting notes of Destiny.
Some talk about Sir ’Enry, and the Goodwood
’Andicap,
And ’ow I’d put me socks on Fairy Queen;
A-gazin’ at the ’eavens with me ’ead upon ’er lap,
Two bonzer eyes was all the stars I seen.
The sea was all a-glitter, like a duchess at a ball,
Each wavelet snatched a diamond as it fled,
And tossed it to a cobber who never let it fall —
The wine of life went leaping to me ’ead.
“’Er name is Mary Alice,” sang the surf in bari-
tone ;
“Gord Save” was wafted to us from afar;
She said “The sand is chilly, me feet is cold as
stone,”
And so we wended upwards to the car.
Within the darkened doorway of Pedro Fislianchips
’Er fragrant breath was playing on me cheek;
I kissed ’er ’air, ’er eyebrows, I fastened on ’er
1ip5......
’Ow can I live without ’er for a week!

“Herodot”: There were others beside
“Cato’s” soldier (B. G/3/’24) arraigned for
firing on the King’s enemies. I have in
mind an Aussie who had been repeatedly
rejected on medical grounds when lie tried
to enlist. Finally he stowed away on an
outgoing troopship, reached France, and had
been on active service for nearly three
months before his illegal presence in the
battalion to which he had attached himself
was discovered. He was sent to England
to be court-martialled on the charge of having
unlawfully fired on the King’s enemies, speci-
fic occasions and dates being mentioned. The
abandoned criminal was even in some hazard
of doing a stretch in a military gaol, but the
papers got hold of the affair and the brass-
hats were induced to listen to reason.
“Lex”: No less than three alimony appli-
cations, pendente Etc,, in which there were
heated arguments as to the husband's means
came before the Sydney courts in one recent
week. Lovely woman has a powerful weapon
here. If the husband is not prepared to
accept her often fantastic estimate of his
financial status, he must show that he is
poor. But it is often more disastrous, especi-
ally in the case of a business man, to admit
indigence than it is to pawn all and give to
his wife. The second procedure represents
an embarrassment; the first may mean ruin.
A slightly different situation is presented in
a fourth big suit, in which a herd of: counsel
have already been briefed on both sides, but
in which the inevitable alimony issue has
not yet been raised. It is a minor catas-
BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED IN HIM.
ELOPING WIFE (crying) : “I’ve just had a (sob ) telegram from my husband.”

socks, the brute!”
troplxe for a' citizen to be disclosed as ex-
travagantly rich. “Publish anything about
me except that I’m a millionaire,” a big
shipping man is accustomed to say to press-
men. The publication of that fact reminds
every cadger in the community that there is
a vast store of cash to be drawn on, and for
weeks afterwards the Fat Man gets no peace.
There is many a citizen with an income of
£15,000 a year, or over, who would consider
his ’wife well lost if by her agency he could
only get the press to broadcast the news that
he was really a wheelbarrow disguised as a
Rolls-Royce.
“Bouragi”: A belated acount has been
published in Melbourne of a murderous
assault on L. A. Flint, assistant R.M. in
the Central Division of Papua. Flint was
crossing a log bridge when a treacherous

native carrier aimed a blow at him from
behind with a long-handled tomahawk. The
blow missed the magistrate and nearly de-
capitated a native policeman. In the sub-
sequent melee two more police were wounded ;
the attackers got away, but were laid by the
heels six months later. It is worth noting
that, though Papua has for years been ex-
plored and patrolled by small Government
parties, casualties, considering the dangers
and the odds against the white men, have
been astonishingly few. Many have gone
under to fever, but only three magistrates
have been butchered by the natives. Hunter,
who was a “Government agent,” was
strangled or smothered by his native wife’s
people near Port Moresby. Green, the first
lI,M. on the Mambare, was killed and eaten
with his police at Tamata. Giulianetti, an
Italian who had been with D’Alberti, was
shot dead, while asleep in his house at
Mekeo, by one of his own police. Consider-
ing the many hundreds who have gone among
the “outside men” in Papua during the last
30 years or so, either the luck of the service
has been wonderful or its courage and re-
source have been out of the common.
“The Deacon’’ sees Anthony, home :
The suburban stillness of our street was disturbed
by heartrending cries of “Anthony, Anthony. Oh,
my Anthony, where are you? Oh, my darling must
have been killed!’’ And the wail went on for
Anthony. 1 attached myself to the rescue party,
and, locating the scene of the disturbance in a bun-
galow recently acquired and occupied, we raced to
the assistance of the
soul in turmoil. llut
Rachel weeping for her
children and refusing
to be comforted was
not a circumstance
compared with the
grief of our newest
neighbor. She was
firmly convinced that if
it wasn't a motor-hog
it was some dreadful
cart that had killed
the little fellow. We
had hardly set out co
discover the remains
when a succession of
dreadful yelps, followed
by the deep-throated
howl of Bill Sheppard’s
nondescript mongrel,
threw the bereaved soul
into a further fmr'.y of
hysterics. At the psy-
chological moment,
however, a moth-eaten

rounded the corner
with the mong. Jess
than a length behind
and gaining fast. From
the scream of relief
with which our newly-
found bereaved threw
herself forward we
knew we had salvaged
Anthony.
“Delver”: When the Hood pushes the
water of Sydney Harbor aside the latest,
thing in floating war-machinery will be on
view. Seventy-eight years ago a few people
gathered about the scrubby foreshores of
the same harbor to see the first steam war-
vessel enter the Heads and drop anchor in
Farm Cove. The craft which came into Port
Jackson on January 7, 1846, was H.M.S.
Driver. She carried only four guns, tiny
ones at that, and was no bigger than a small
coaster; but, as indicating the tremendous
possibilities of steam-driven battleships, she
impressed the critics of the period as strongly
as the Hood is likely to do those of the
present day. But the skipper of the Driver
was not the first British naval officer to
pilot a steamer into Sydney. On May 10.
1831, the steamer Sophia Jane (250 tons and
50h.p.) arrived from England under com-
mand of Lieutenant Biddulph, R.N. She
was the first to make the trip from
England; shortly after arrival she was
placed in the Sydney-Newcastle trade.
“Centurion": The Turkish Government,
when it sent the Sultan-Caliph packing from
Constantinople, may have unwittingly done
Britain a great service. In this matter
England, simply because she is greatest
of Mohammedan Powers, from the stand-
point of tiie number of her subjects, has
always had to tread warily. But now that
Turkey has taken peremptory action, the
dangerous Caliphate agitation in India will
lose its raison d'etre, and Islam generally
looks like splitting up into sections over the
question of its religious head. The Arabs
of Mesopotamia, Transjordania, Palestine
and the Hedjaz will be solid for King 'Hus-
sein, of the Hedjaz, as the new Commander
of the Faithful. Other candidates are the
Sultan of Morocco, a Berber, and Sultan
Fuad, of Egypt, who is a Turco-Gyppo,
with all the dubious qualities of that breed.
The Sheikh, el Senussi may also find backers.
With several Caliphs dividing the age-old
jurisdiction of one. the solidarity of Islam
will be a thing of the past.
“Whitehall” : Those with knowledge of the
gay life of London will grin at the. cabled
announcement that to Hector's—the Totten-
ham Court Load night club which has just
been de-registored for selling drink after
hours —“foreign ambassadors and Ministers
of the Crown were admitted as members
without paying a subscription.” So they
were at the old Alsatians when “Pony”
Moore, father-in-law of Mitchell the pug.
was in charge, and police raids were fre-
quent and casual revolver-shooting not un-
known. But the potentates rarely, if ever,
turned up to partake of their privileges. An
examination of the membership list of the
Alsatians would have disclosed names even
more distinguished than those borne by
Cabinet Ministers of the period. Thus a
friend and I paid our guinea apiece, on being
unanimously elected by the janitor at the
door at about one o’clock one thirsty morn-
ing in June, and were gravely entered up as
Charles Dickens and William Makepeace
Thackeray. Rector’s is, of course, more ex-
clusive than those Edwardian haunts, the
lineal descendants of the “Cave of Harmony”
which Pendennis attended. But it has
always been frequented by substantially the
same class —festive young men about town,
theatrical ladies, ladies who call themselves
theatricals, and Society maidens so like the
bogus theatricals in dress and manners as to
be indistinguishable from them. And at
bottom every night club is the same club.
“Napper Tandy”: The language question
is the newest rock for Irishmen to split on,
The Irish News (24/l/’24) quotes an acri-
monious correspondence between two firms
of solicitors on this point. A Mr. Oli-Uad-
haigh, who has evidently gone the whole hog
with his own name for a start, served a
notice of trial on some brother practitioners,
Hogan and Shields, of Loughrea, and re-
ceived in return an intimation that the docu-
ment conveyed nothing whatever to the re-
cipients and a request for a translation.
This, however, Oh-Uadhaigli flatly refused
to furnish, adding some stinging remarks
about a firm that professed ignorance of a
language “placed in a position of primacy
by the Free State Constitution” and
“accepted unmurmuringly (in warrants) by
under-sheriffs with no Gaelic antecedents/'
This led Hogan and Shields to inquire satiri-
cally if they were expected to go out and
waylay under-sheriffs without Gaelic ante-
cedents to interpret the notice for them, and
the exchange of six-and-eiglitpenny amenities
was only closed by the Court ruling that
the document was good. The decision suggests
that, there is now a part of the British
Empire where even a drunk may claim the
right to choose which of two languages he
shall be fined five bob in.

Lawson will complete his sixth year as
Premier of Vic. to-morrow (March 21). Prior
to the latest re-sliuffle he had had 29 col-
leagues associated with him. Arthur Rob-
inson, the Law Minister, is the only one
who has stuck to him—or has been per-
mitted to stick to him —right through.
Archie Meston, journalist, Parliamen-
tarian, explorer, ethnologist, athlete and a
host of other things, came to the finish of
his varied career in Brisbane the other day at
73. An Aberdonian, he reached Australia
in 1871, saw some station life on the Upper
Clarence (N.S.W.), then went to Banana-
land, where he tried some more station life,
sugar-planting, journalism and politics. In
Parliament Meston used to crowd his long
speeches with classical quotations, and a
famous reference to the Sacred Ibis of
ancient Egypt earned him a nickname which
stuck to him for the rest of his life. His
bush experiences provided him with his chief
interest, the Queensland aborigines. Not
only was his knowledge of the blacks pro-
found, but he was held in the highest re-
gard by Binghi himself, and in his 10 years
as Protector of Queensland Aborigines
(1898-1908) did very good work, though
he was less successful with the “civilised”
blacks of the settled districts than with the
wild and semi-wild people of the North. In
later years he was in charge of the Queens-
land Bureau in Sydney, but he was always
in exile out of Queensland.

The only defeat Alec Peacock, Vic. Min-
ister of Education, lias suffered on contest-
ing a Parliamentary seat was 21 years ago,
when he submitted himself to the will of
both Houses of his State’s Parliament for
the Senate vacancy created by “Yardstick”
Sargood’s death. Robert Reid, M.L.C.,
then Minister for Education under Irvine,
won the seat with the support of the Kya-
bramapootra Freetraders and no-surrender
Tories, who hated Peacock because of his
Factories Act. The present Senator Barker
was a bad third on the poll. Peacock had
not to forfeit his State seat to nominate
for the Senate, and the flutter cost him
nothing but a few days’ disappointment. So
he will celebrate his 3oth birthday as a Vic.
Assembly member to-morrow week (March
28).
“Loco”: Tom Burke, the owner of Quin-
tus, winner of the Newmarket Handicap,
was one of the Vie. railway men who stirred
things up in 1902 03. He was a clerk at
Ararat when he got the chair of the A.N.A.
in 1902, and after that there came a long-
denied transfer to Melbourne and the open
road to success. He soon got out of the Railway
Department, and was largely instrumental
in forming the Civil Service Co-op. Stores ;
then, finding that the civil servants did not
support that not very well conducted affair,
he started in the real-estate business —and
lie and John Wren are now said to be the
biggest income-taxpayers in Vic. If you
happen to be on the Ararat railway-station
platform with him. Burke will point out to
you One Tree Hill, which he used to climb
as a kid, laden with butter and eggs for
market, from his parents’ little farm.

Grenfell is the first place in N. S. Wales
to unveil a memorial to Henry Lawson.
That is as it should be, for here the poet
was born. After their marriage his parents
had a luckless venture with a store at Gul-
gong; the place, well stocked and unin-
sured, was burnt down two weeks after it
was opened. The Lawsons moved to Weddin
Mountain, Grenfell, and shortly afterwards
the poet was born in a tent. The memorial
marks the spot.
Dr. Borthwick, health officer in Adelaide
till the. end of January, did not long survive
his going out of harness; or, rather, he
stuck to work till the last moment in face
of an incurable malady. He came to Aus-
tralia with an Edinburgh degree as a young
in 1883, and gradually became the
chief local authority on matters of bac-
teriology and hygiene.

Limerick 40 years ago, when he was 20.
Dor his work as sec. to the St. Mary’s
Cathedral Building Fund, and also for his
St. Fat’s Day efforts, the Pope made him,
some years ago, a Knight of St. Sylvester
—a title of which lie was inordinately proud.
Woods was a financial power behind the
official R.C. organ, the Catholic Press,
but he will be best remembered for his
work on behalf of the Mater Misericordia;
Hospital at North Sydney.
J. T. Hackett, one of Adelaide’s many
literary lawyers, is dead in Egypt (where
lie was travelling), at 65. He was one of
the first boys, at Wesley College, Melbourne,
liis father being in the Vic. public service;
after being admitted as a solicitor he became
a junior partner in Adelaide of John Bray,
S.A. Premier and (later) Agent-General.
In his earlier days Hackett made a collec-
tion of bits of prose and verse that appealed
to him; after retiring from his profession
he published them as “My Commonplace
Book,” with notes of his own that caused
a lot of interest and ran the volume into
two or three editions in London.
Nathan F. Spielvogel (“The Gumsueker”)
began his school life at the Central School
in Ballarat in 1878, and stayed there as pupil
and junior teacher till 1895, when he went
out to the bush. Now. after 29 years’ ab-
sence, he is going back to the old school
as headmaster.
An artist who had long been forgotten as
a Maorilander was Alfred Strutt, who has
just died. Cpming across from Taranaki, he
lived in Australia for years; but the fact
that he has been exhibiting iii English gal-
leries since 1877 shows how long ago the ties
with this part of the world were broken. He
had painted a hundred “popular’’ pictures,
of which thousands of reproductions hang
in thousands of old-fashioned “parlors” and
English village pubs. Strutt’s father, grand-
father and great-grandfather were all artists.
There died the other day, at Bournemouth
(Eng.), another of the capitalists whoso
wealth dated back to the land sales of pri-
meval Melbourne. Long before the town
had derived importance from the gold fever
John Werge Howey bought blocks of land
in that portion of Melbourne which ulti-
mately proved to be its heart. After a while
values began to rise; and they kept on rising,
and Howey kept on absorbing unearned incre-
ment. For a long time he lived in Mel-
bourne, but eventually he took his riches to
England, and died in 1869. For the next
55 years J. E. W. Howey lived luxuriously
on further unearned increment from the
property his great-uncle, John Werge Howey,
had acquired so cheaply. This lucky man
was a Majah in the British Army during
the years when there was no fighting to
speak of, and he attained the age of 80 on
the retired list. Ilis eldest son, Capt. J. E.
I‘. Howey, is heir to the greater portion of
the Melbourne property.
Another Crimean, T. Kingsley, died in the
Coast Hospital, Sydney, the other day, at 90.
In the old days he had a butchering business
in Surry Hills, but for the last five years he
had been with the veterans at their N. S.
Wales quarters, Bare Island.
After nearly 50 years spent among retorts
and test-tubes, J. C. H. Mingaye, N. S.
Wales Government analyst and assayer,
went into retirement last week. He had
held the job since March, 1887, and had won
a wide reputation for his laboratory; for
some of his researches English and American
authorities ranked him with the world’s
leading analytical chemists. Mingaye
specialised in coals, cokes and clays, and
practically every Mines Department publica-
tion has given evidence of liis work in un-
ravelling the mysteries of the Ma State’s
mineral resources. Having reached 65 the
law says lie must go; but he is still hale,
and looks as though he could have gone on
indefinitely.
“Gallery” : Of all the Cocky members of
the Federal Ministry, Percy Gerald Stewart
alone seems to have been affected by his
elevation. Pressmen ffom papers which sus-
pect the Minister’s fiscal attitude never find
him with a “Welcome Home” smile on his
rugged countenance. Indeed, a polite ques-
tion may be met with a rasping request to
appeal to the charwoman or the liftman, and
the reporter retires with the feeling that
Ilughes and Stowart learnt their urbanity
from the same correspondence school. It
is a pity, since there is general admiration
for Ins strength and energy. Stewart ought
to watch his colleagues Page and Gibson,
who have achieved popularity because they
are kindly and unassuming in all their
official relations.
Mrs. Isabella Brown, who has died at
lorbos (N.S.W.), aged 86. had gone through
the pioneering and digging days of the
Lachlan. She was the mother of Tom
Brown, ex-Federal and State member for
the district.
Tom Gilchrist, who has been promoted
from sec. of Vic. Parliamentary Railway
Committee to be Clerk Assistant of the Leg.
Assembly, was for two long spells at the end
of last century political and departmental
roundsman for the Argus, and later joined
Hansard. He has waxed fat in the service
and, like C. S. McPherson, Pub. Service
Commissioner, is an irredeemable bachelor.
“L.G.” (London) : Lord Beauchamp sat
at a small table among the mere mob at the
dinner tendered to S. M. Bruce by the Lon-
don A.N.A. He doubtless cogitated on how
he would have drafted the pure merinos from
the crossbreds had he been given a chance.
Someone told me a yarn that when Queen
I ic. w-a.s asked to assent to Beauchamp’s
appointment as Governor of N. S. Wales
she said: “An excellent choice, gentlemen—
provided you send a nursemaid to look after
him.” The shrewd old lady must have
chuckled when she heard about the “birth-
stains” message and the seidlitz-powder ball.
South Aus. has had news of Crawford, the
spectacled English international cricketer who
helped it to win the Sheffield Shield in 1910
and 1913. When lie fill out with Surrey he
came to Adelaide as a master at St. Peter’s
School; but cricket was the one thing he
was any good at. and eventually he was
a paid coach to the S.A. Cricket Assoc., till
he got a better offer in M.L. While in
Adelaide he married a daughter of that Rail-
ways Department Smith who is also secre-
tary of the Naval and Military Club. After
the war he returned to Surrey, but eventu-
ally, became a pro. with a Lancashire League
club. About the same time his wife divorced
him ; it is she who is going to marry Keith
Smith the air-man—also an Adelaide pro-
duct.
, 0 ?®. ° f , % very few S.A. veterans who
admitted doing any good out of the Victorian
diggings to which they all flocked over as
young men was Andrew Thomson, just dead
at Kapunda. He had fair luck himself, but
his keenest enjoyment was in recalling how
lie helped to carry the “Welcome” nugget—
-22170z., and sold for £10,500. After that he
was for nearly 70 years a storekeeper and
auctioneer at the copper town, Kapunda.
Speaker J. W. EVANS, on whose casting
rote Tasmania has just decided to ask the
British Government to send the Speck
another imported, Governor.
“E.R.M.”: The late Charles Mulry, the
hard-faced and convivial Bananaland stock-
buyer (B. 14/2/’24), went to Sydney some
time ago with a racehorse, and had up to
£lOOO in cash to put on for Rockhampton
friends. On the eventful day Charles came
back from the course and wired to Rock-
hampton thus: “Money on. Race run.
Money gone—Mulry.” Then he went to
the Central Station - and sat there till the
first train left for Queensland.
“Gallery” : Senator Duncan, who has been
making his voice heard in the Federal Ship-
ping inquiry, learnt to talk in a church debat-
ing society in a Melbourne suburb, where
lie became afflicted with the principles of
Cobden, and said words that would make
David Syme turn in his grave. Duncan
once totted up the accounts on a station,
then did some book-keeping for a Sydney
firm, and afterwards lent a hand in found-
ing the Clerks’ Union. The conscription
issue drove him out of the ranks of Labor.
His grandfather, 'Walter Duncan, repre-
sented Borung for one term in the Vic.
Assembly.
“Bombardos” : All this caterwauling about
Labor pre-selection outrages in N. S.
Wales ought to revive memories of Percy
Brookfield and appreciation of the keen
scout lie is shown to have been. A tireless
investigator, and boiling with indignation
over what he discovered, Brookfield had
reams of records of dirty doings at the pre-
selection crossroads —dates, names, places,
admissions and testimonies. It would be
interesting to know what became of Brook-
field’s damning data when its compiler made
his untimely exit from this world.
When Tom Trumble. sec. of the Defence
Department, now off on a Cold Land trip,
was a fifth-class clerk in the Vic. Defence
Department under Commander Collins 30
years ago, nobody thought he would go fur-
ther than, say, the third-class in the clerical
division. Opportunity, backed by latent am-
bition, however, found the man and he rose
to the top job. But good luck gave him a
lift or two when administrative colleagues
passed out comparatively young or obtained
transfers. H. R. Mackay, who was a long
way senior to him, is second Vic. Forest
Commissioner now, and draws less pay.
“Trout”: Ex-Treasurer McPherson’s gift
of £25,000 for a School of Domestic Economy
is one of the greatest benefactions Victoria
has received from its public men. Apart
from the noble sum which Alfred Felton
placed aside for educating an indifferent
populace in the beauties of art. notable gifts
have been Samuel Wilson’s £30,000 to the
Melbourne Uni. in 1875, Francis Ormond’s
£15,000 for the Working Men’s College and
£20,000 for a Chair of Music at the ’Varsity,
and James Stewart’s £25.624 for the advance-
ment of anatomy, medicine and surgery.
MePhairson was slightly more generous than
Sam Gillottt, who earmarked £23,900 for
general endowment; and George Swinburne
will have to dip deeper in his pockets if he
wants to beat his neighbor, though he has
already done much for the Swinburne Tech-
nical College.

An’ “What’s she like?” I said.
An’ Bill jest ’elil ’is glass as it
’E feared that it might spill,

“’Ow's things in general?” says me.
They weren’t too bad, Bill swore.

“It ain’t too bad,” ’e says.
Well, I was mates with Bill in France

"Gran'pa, do chickens lay eggs for pleasure or for their health?"
“Almurtu” : Bush surgery? While I was
in charge of the native police at Heavitree Gap
police camp, Alice Springs (CJentralia), in the winter
of 1895, one of the trackers, Tom Cribb, was bring-
ing the horses in, when one kicked at his mount and
got Tom’s leg instead, breaking the shinbone. 1
immediately wired the Colonial Surgeon for instruc-
tions as to treatment, etc. He replied: “Get the
bones to meet, then bandage the leg in splints ; dress
the wounds with carbolic.” The telegraph-operator
who brought the doctor’s reply to the camp assisted
the constables, but after several attempts we found
it impossible to get the bones to meet, as they over-
lapped. I said: “We’ll have to saw off a small piece
of the bone before we can get them together.” We
were wondering how we were going to raise a small
saw for this job, when one of the constables, a very
resourceful bushman, said he could make a saw out
of a pocket-knife with a small file. And he did —
and did it well, too. We fixed Tom up for the opera-
tion, and as we did not keep anaesthetics at the sta-
tion I gave him a first-mate’s nip of whisky (the
first he ever tasted). The sawing of the bone was
a great success. The patient treated the operation
as a joke, and had a big grin on his face all the
time we were hacking his leg about. Everything
went O.K. afterwards. Tom became as fit as ever,
and you could not notice any difference in his leg
-—and the rascal showed his gratitude later on by
joining some other bucks in killing my goats.
* * * *
“Wee Bobbie” : I chased an Bft. crocodile
for two hours and a half in a dingy over a big
stretch of water with a depth of about 10ft. He
would swim no distance in one direction before
doubling back and lying still, and once one of the
natives poked him with an oar. The croc., with
two snaps, bit it in splinters. Years afterwards I
saw a New' Guinea nig. take a noosed grass rope,
dive off a canoe down to where a croc, lay in
the clear water of a river hole and drop the noose
over the reptile’s head. Someone told me it was a
common thing for natives to lasso crocodiles that
way ; but, remembering how the 8-footer had snapped
an ash oar in two, 1 w'as prepared to humbly salute
that nigger or any other who does the head-roping.
“E.V.R.” : Asphyxiation of fish by muddy
flood w'aters is common in Victoria. In this district
(Coliban River) the inhabitants never fail, to pick
up large hauls of cod, perch and trout after every
decent fresh. The fish, in their efforts to find
clearer water, get out to the edges of the flood and
are left behind by the falling waters in small pools
and holes, generally in a half-smothered condition.
A netting fence near the river bank usually yields
a good bag, since the fish go over it with the rising
flood and fail to get back again before the water-
falls below- the fence-top level. After any really
big flood, fish are left stranded by the thousand.
Along the Brodribb River (East Gippsland) I
once saw mullet lying two feet deep over a river
flat half a mile long and 200 yards wide. ' Even a
steaka-da-oyst purveyor would have blanched at the
odor therefrom. If any abo. happens to have a
small, shallow lagoon handy with fish in it, and his
hunger sends his sporting instinct to sleep, let him
wade in and roam up and down for a while. In
about 15 minutes the fish will begin to pop then-
heads up. The unrequired residue will recover if
the “treading-out” process is discontinued.
“Nitric”: Re “Surcingle’s” par. on tbe
abos.’ method of training prads (B. 28/2/’24). He
forgets cne thing that a man who has ever used
black-trained neddies can’t, forget. The horse is
always caught in the yard: by. means of a whip.
The boy flicks the foreleg of the prad, and keeps on
doing it, flicking him forward all the time—the
horse always advances. After a few days of this the
neddy will come up to the boy as soon as he hears
the whip crack. I’ve seen a good horseman who
could throw or catch a horse nine times out of ten
held up for half an hour by one little colt. In a fit
of rage he went for his whip, and as soon as he
entered the yard the prad w'alked up' to him and
nibbled out of his hand. He was black-trained.
* * * *
“Nitric”: Some trees, like some human
beings, need tonics,
and just as one is able
to kill a tree by an
injection of arsenic
so . one may stimulate
it by a substance such
as sulphur. At Indoo-
roopilly (Q.) a man
bored holes in an old
and apparently dying-
mango-tree and plugged
them with flowers of
sulphur. Within a
week or so an effect
was noticeable; there
was an increase of
foliage and a general
appearance of healthi-
ness. In 13 months
i o tree bloomed four
times. From the first
fruiting two cases of
mangoes were taken;
from the second and
third effort one case
was provided, but in
the fourth the old
tree surpassed all its
previous records and
yielded two tons of
fine quality fruit.
Orange and lemon
trees also after a similar treatment showed improve-
ment.
“W.A.H.”: My old roan mare had greasy
heels, so I armed the new-chum rouseabout with a
tin of coaehaline and instructed him to grease her
hoofs. Two hours later, when I found him following
the old mare about' the paddock and swore at him,
he explained: “Well, zir, I was waitin’ for she to
lie down.”
“Morob”: The native sorcerer of New
Guinea is as an expert at sleight-of-hand. A boy
employed at a Government station in the Mandated
Territory developed a swollen gland in the thign,
and, although he went to the local hospital, the
treatment at first did not have any effect. Subse-
quently he was “examined” by a sorcerer, who
diagnosed the trouble as due to a small lizard whici
had found its way into the patient’s body. He under
took to cure the trouble by cutting the reptile on-.
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.
“Look here, pater! You mustn't believe all the lies you hear about a chap. Half of
’em are not true, you know.”
to which the patient—who had accepted the diagnosis
without the faintest doubt —was quite agreeable. As
the sorcerer did not have any objection, a friend
and myself decided to be present and watch the
operation. The surgeon placed himself so that the
patient could not see what he was doing, and with
a sharp knife made from the top of a cigarette-tin
cut swiftly across the swollen gland, making an
opening just large enough to insert one finger. Both
of us are still prepared to swear that he had nothing
in his hand when he made the incision, but a second
or- so later he triumphantly hooked out a small and
vigorously-wriggling lizard and held it up for our
inspection. The patient behaved as though he would
have been surprised had a lizard not been produced,
and within a couple of days he was quite well and
about again.
“Centre”: “A.E.G.’s” swimming cat (B.
6/3/’24) is not unique. There is a puss in Brisbane
that thinks nothing of syvimming across a 10ft. wide
creek, apparently for no other reason that that she
likes swimming exercise. • She basks on the opposite
bank for a time, and then returns via the plank foot-
bridge about 50yds. further up stream. Oats do
dislike getting their feet wet, though in the face of
their taking to water at times and their penchant
for philandering in drizzling rain, it is hard to
understand why.
•***■*
“H.T.”: Re “Two Seas” on fencing (B.
21/2/’24). In 1910, when working for a contractor,
I sank the holes and put up 2594 posts in 168 actual
working hours (time kept). No post was less than
23in. in the ground and some were more; every
18th post a strainer, 3ft. in the ground. I was not
a champion at the game, but it was always reckoned,
in those days that if a man could not put up 100
or more in eight hours, he was a mug. This was west
of the Darling, and the fence was 7j : miles long
from start to finish, through belar, box, sandalwood,
blue-bush flats and mallee (no sand). This can be
vouched for by the station manager and other men
on the job. The fence is still there, as good as the
day it was put up.
“Bouragi” : “Morob’s” theory that varia-
tion in the color of “black” races may be due to
geological environment (B. 28/2/’24) will hardly
fit in with the “protective pigmentation” theory of
the ethnologists. “Morob” thinks, too, that the
presence of lime in the soil has much to do with
light coloring. Yet the abos. of the Nullarbor Plain
and other Australian limestone formations are just
as black as any of their relatives on non-limestone
country. The same is true of the inland Papuans
of the limestone valleys and plateaus of the Central-
West. Color variation in the Islands and Papua is
invariably the result of interbreeding with light-
skinned races. The Papuan people proper—l am
necessarily generalising roughly—are split in two
by a light-skinned folk inserted like a wedge from
East Cape westward till the beginning of the Gulf
of Papua is reached. West of it and to the nor’-
east is found the black Papuan, growing blacker as
the - distance from the source of miscegenation in-
creases. This Melanesian-Micronesian (perhaps also
-Polynesian) invasion left its trail behind it as it
came north-west. It brought with it totemism and
many other things unknown to the true Papuan.
Here and there the stream w T as dammed or diverted,
so that the black folk are found on Buka, as “Morob”
says, or on Rossel Island, while behind, in front
and on either side are found light-colored people of
a different type.
“Cobba-Cobba”: “Mag’s” beetlers (B.
14/2/’24) are only town folks out for a little recrea-
tion and pocket-money. Night beetling with lamp
and white sheet is a waste of good time and beetles,
as, when disturbed, 75 per cent, of the cane pests
fly away. While the season lasts (generally six
weeks following the heavy December rains) profes-
sional catchers in northern cane districts make big
money. The early-morning dew cramps the wings of
the beetles, thus preventing their flight, and from
the first streak of dawn until about 8 a.m. the
beetler is kept busy shaking trees and collecting his
catch. When the sun’s ravs warm up their wings
the beetles take flight, and it is then useless to con
tinue catching. In a seven-weeks’ season at Gordcn-
vale, with beetles at Is. per lb., 1 knocked up an
£B9 cheque, and never used a lamp or sheet. With
the assistance of three abos. —on the quiet, of course,
their services in the industry being strictly barred —
a Gordonvale resident the same season cleared £2l
a week; and he never lost a day’s work. In one
fortnight the Mulgrave Mill, at Gordonvale, paid for
and destroyed over six tons of beetles, dockets to
the value of £784 representing the value of the
catch.
“Devilfish”: According to the recent and
authoritative “Diving Manual,” by E. H. Davis,
managing-director of the London submarine engi-
neers, Siebe and Gorman, Ltd., the greatest depth
yet reached by divers is 275 ft. This was recorded
by three U.S.A. Navy divers,, using the decompres-
sion methods lately adopted by the, British Admiralty.
A British committee has proved that it is quite pos-
sible to do serious work at a depth of ,210 ft.; that
is Gunner Catho’s record off the Scottish coast, and
he stayed under for 35 minutes. (Seaman Maskell

located the* L 24 in the English Channel the other
week at a depth of a 87ft.) Angel Erostarbe, a
Spaniard, recovered £12,000 in silver bars from the
sunken steamer Skyro, off Cape Finisterre, at a
depth of 182 ft. That is the greatest depth for any
big job. The maximum depth at which the sponge
fishers of the Mediterranean and the pearl-divers v>f
the Australian coast work is given as 150 ft. As to
skin diving, Davis will have none of the stories
about the pearl-divers of the Persian Gulf staying
six minutes under water. He cuts it down to about
two minutes.

THE RUNAWAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas Saturday morning—the town’s busy day—
And the cookies came in in a motley array.
They lined their carts up in a queue by the store
And the women looked hard at what each other
wore.
A gusty wind blew that sent dust rolling by
And lifted the scraps of torn paper on high;
A nervous bush-horse watched the dust as it rose
Till a torn colored poster swept under his nose.
Then up went his forelock and out went his feet,
Just missing a car that was crossing the street.
The cart skidded sideways, the cushion flew out,
As dogs came to sec what the fuss was about
A wheel grazed a tree-guard and shifted the load
And parcels were broadcasted over the road.
.Soon doorways were crowded, and small children
ran,
The shopmen and cookies turned out to a man.
A cop trieel to block it but soon changed his mind ;
And some made an effort to spring up behind.
The cart overturned and then righted again,
Though wing-boards and dash-board were lost in the
strain.
The horse was outstretched as though leading a race
And the cries of “Whoa!” “Way!” only smartened
his pace.
Striped aproned, a butcher ran out of his shop
With vain hopes the rebel might heed him and stop ;
His dog came' to help him and dodging the wheels
Was snapping arid nipping the horse on' the heels.
The flapping and slapping of harness arid gear
And the dog at his heels sent, him crazy with fear ;
A loose board or two added noise to the din
As they crashed on a lamp-post that crumpled like
tin.
But it steadied the rush and a man caught the reins
That broke, and a fall was reward for his pains;
The breeching-strap snapped • and the cart gave a
jump
And pressed on the horse and was chafing his rump.
Then he lashed out behind and he kicked to the
side
And shattered the woodwork that flew far and wide.
A horseman came now —all the footmen were spent—
He had hopes of securing the rein as he bent ;
But the horse in the cart heard the clatter behind
And the fear in his heart made him take the street
blind.
There were streaks of red blood where the lather
was white
As he swerved to the left and he lurched to the
right.
The rider caught hold as the cart swuhg around,
But he had to let, go, or be dragged to the ground;
A fence-post was struck and the railing was smashed
And a wheel stayed behind where the runaway
crashed.
With the axle-point ploughing the horse steadied
down
Till he came to his home on the edge of the town.
Though the roadway was curving, he held his course
straight
And wrecked what was left of the cart on the gate.

“Cobba-Cobba” : Banana-growers in Queens-
land have a, powerful friend in the centipede. The
many-legged purveyor of red-hot torture relishes the
larvae of the beetle boyer, and is rapidly ridding
banana plantations of the pest. He has no objection
to making a meal of full-grown borers, so what he
misses at birth lie catches later.
“Caloola”: If there’s a fishing competi-
tion among Australian birds, my wad goes on the
pelican. While at Tuggerah Lakes (N.S.W.) recently
I got some idea of what these clumsy-looking birds
can eio. One old chap caught a large mullet and
held it up as if to let me see it; then, after tossing
it into the air, he gave it fully two seconds’ start
and dived after it. Again and again he caught and
released that fish, apparently just to demonstrate to
me how easy it was. When chasing the mullet
under water he left a trail like that of a ferry
steamer’s propeller.
In the matter of sheep’s flesh and goat’s:
“Bouragi”: “F.A.” is wrong in saying (B.
6/'3/’24) that sheep and goat flesh are as- different
as Murray cod and goanna, and that goat-flesh
has an odor “not exactly what one would call
alluring.” Much depends on the goat. It might
be true of an aged William, but i’ll defy anyone
to distinguish between the meat of a young gelded
goat and that of ordinary butchers’ lamb. One is
quite as white, tender and delicately flavored as
the other. The only difference is that goat’s flesh
is i nvaridbl v leaner than mutton. I kept a flock
of goats in? Papua for some years, gelding the
“killers,” arid always doing my own butchering;
and I found my opinion on that experience.
“P.X.”; Twenty-five years ago, at the (Juandong
bush-pub, West Darling, a dozen of us sat to a
couple of legs of lamb. Old Nicholas Sadlier, man-
ager of Albemarle, was at one end. “Bill,” he said
to Sugars, the landlord, after we’d finished up both
joints, “produce that tail.” “You’re right, boss,”
said Bill. None of the rest of us had noticed
anything wrong. We thought we were eating lamb,
and good lamb too. The old man confessed that he
wouldn’t have suspected anything if the tail hadn’t
been missing. Bill then made his famous joke:
“livery goat’s tail is a tell-tale.” Incidentally, we
all thought w T e knew something about sheep—-we
lived among them, at any rate.
SUNDAY TRADERS.
"Struth! Not near the crowd they get at Grogan’s!”
“Globe” : I was preparing to climb a tree
for a couple of young cockatoos I had seen in a nest
a week before, when my mate remarked: “It’s no
good—they’ve flown.” He said it with absolute
assurance, and I asked him how he knew. “It’s this
way,” he said; “when the young birds are ready to
fly the parents have a deuce of a job in getting
them to leave the nest, so they cut the tucker short.
Then the old birds, from the edge of the nest, flv
straight out, catch a leaf from the branches an 1
flutter to the ground with it, making a pretence of
eating. The young ’uns, watching this, and getting
more hungry as time goes on, are soon impelled to
take the big step.” Pointing up, he showed me
where some leaves had been chopped off from a
branch just outside the nest. Doubting, I climbed
the tree and got—nothing.
“Pat Busliie’’: The name given a dish
on a menu may have a lot to do with the demand
for it (B. 28/2/’24), but the chap who sat next co
me in a pub near Lake Macquarie the other Sunday
had another principle of selection. It was a long
table, and he was last but one to be offered “Roast
fowl, roast beef, lamb and mint sauce.” I noticed
QUITE A MODERN MOTHER.
TEACHER: “Now I want to know something the cuckoo
does that is peculiar.”
BRIGHT BOY: “Please, mum, it’s the bird which puts its
eggs out to be laid by another bird.”
he was keenly interested in all the preceding orders
given, and after he had picked on roast beef he put
me wise to his “system.” “Too many are after
fowl, so the bit you get won't be worth eating.
Three want lamb, and they’ll divide about all that’s
cub. beforehand. I’m the only one for beef ; there s
sure to be a few portions of that cut, and they'll put
an extra-good issue on my plate.” He was right.
His was a bumper feed; my bit of fowl was a
mockery for any healthy “twist.”
* * * *
“Valamac” ; For reliable weather-prophets
let me nominate the white-ants that are so numerous
in most parts of North Queensland. Patches of wet
mud will often be found plastered on the side of the
anthills, and you can then depend on it rain will
follow within a week or so. The sign never fails. If
the mud is plastered on one side of the nest only,
the rain will come from the opposite direction. If
there is mud on all sides' and also on top of the
nest, you can expect heavy rain from all directions
and, possibly, floods. It may be clear, fine weather
when the ants start putting these additions on their
homes, but rain follows as invariably as night follows
day.
* * * *
“Wingella”: Has the N. Territory pon-
eiana any value as a paper maker? It is the
quickest grower I know among trees. I planted a
dozen round the house about four years ago. They
were then only three feet high, and as thick as a
man’s thumb. Now one is a good 20ft. high, with
a trunk 9in. in dia-
meter, and a spread of
branches 30ft. across.
And this after freo.uent
cutting back to keep
it symmetrical. The
other trees are all
well grown, the small-
est having a trunk
diameter of six inches
and a spread of 15ft.
None of them has had
any attention beyond
an occasional cutting
back. They get no
water in the dry sea-
son, and need no culti-
vating. The wood is
very soft and very
white, and should hs
ideal for wood-pulp
and paper-making,
since it would need no
bleaching.. 1 ncidentally,
they are dinkum Aus-
tralians. My seedlings
were picked up in the
jungle, and they are
not only quick-growing
but hardy, and are
splendidly ornamental,
especially when in full
flower. I have heard Queenslanders call them coral-
trees and flame-trees, but Territorians know* them
only as poncianas.
“C.C.”: Here’s a good dingo tip which I
first saw put into practice near Augathclla (Q.) four
years ago. A young sheep was killed, and after
a small bottle of aniseed oil had been poured over
the body it was thrown on to a cleared piece of
land. Half a dozen of us got behind the bushes
with our rifles, and the sun had hardly set before
four dogs bounded into the open and commenced to
devour the carcase ravenously. They were promptly
knocked over; but it made no difference to the
pack—they came to the carcase faster than we could
shoot them. In half an hour 32 warrigals were lying
round the mangled sheep. I have also seen the wild-
est horses in the district caught by the same method.
Place a little of the oil in the palm of your hand
and approach the noddy with the wind. The moment
he scents the oil he will come right up to you—you
can’t keep him away.
“Nugget”: I came upon them on a small
selection in the scrub beyond
Dungog (N.S.W.). The man was
hoeing corn into the uncultivated
soil between the trees. He was
using a hoe not from preference
but from necessity. 1 commented
on his tarry hands and clothes,
and he said the flamin’ bandi-
coots had scratched up his last
crop, so he soaked this lot in tar
to keep them away. Heaven
knows whether the corn ever
germinated, and, if it did, how
he protected it from bush marau-
ders ! The man’s wife was at
work in the scorching heat to
make a two-roomed shack look
like home, while a few miserable
fowls —to which she referred
proudly as “the poultry’’—
scratched and clucked under the
carcase of a kangaroo suspended
from a near-by tree. The ’roo
was “well dead,” and provided a
steady supply of fowl-feed. The
constant, exacting work of run-
ping that selection returned a
net income of something like a
pound a week. Exclusive of the
husband’s value as a laborer, the
wife could have earned double
that money as a “general.” She
knew this, but preferred to
struggle on out there —the home
was their very own. Such is the.
heroism of the bush woman —or is it just her magni-
ficent blanky foolishness ?
* * * *
“Ross”: In addition to the instances of
cruelty to horses cited by “Te Kurri” (B. 21/2/’24)
there is the practice which obtains on most of the
W. Queensland and N.-W. N. S. Wales stations
of throwing young horses by strangling. If you put
it to the average out-back station-hand that it is
barbarous and ought to be abandoned, he will agree
with you that it is cruel enough, but will leave
you to infer that it is necessary in the circum-
stances. Just how or why he will not specify. As
a matter of cold fact, it is not at all necessary in
most cases. The only thing to be said in its favor
is that it requires only one rope, and consequently
fewer men ; yet I have often seen it adopted when
there has been an audience of half a dozen station-
hands. Let there be no misapprehension as to the
nature of the practice. The horse is deliberately
choked into unconsciousness, and will not fall until
that end has been attained. To my mind the
whole business is disgustingly cruel and is a blot
on the lives of men who, in the main, are as soft-
hearted and considerate as any I have ever come
across.
* * * *
“The Rumpus” : I recently killed a black
snake with a slate-colored belly in an orchard in the
Ovens Valley (Vic.) and left it lying on the spot
where the tragedy occurred. In the morning the
corpse had disappeared and, tracking it cautiously,
I came upon another snake of similar breed, lugging
its dead mate away. Was it for decent burial? 1
have questioned old inhabitants of this region, but
the like has never been heard of before.
* * * *
“Centre”: While shooting flying-foxes in
Queensland, I brought down an almost dead-white one.
It measured a fraction over 19 inches from wing-tip
to wing-tip, and seemed to be normal in every way
except for its lack of coloring. A local fruitgrower
told me it was only the second of the sort he had
seen in 20 years. I’ve heard there is a species of
white fruit-bat in the Malay Peninsula, but that’s
too far off for one to come over here. What’s the
explanation?
*••***
“Sylvester”: The waters of the Kin Kin
Creek and its branches (S.-E. Q.) are inhabited bv
a species of snake that I have not met with else-
where. It grows to about 3ft. in length, and has a
small venomous-looking head. The color is a dull
brown and grey check. Residents say it is poisonous,
but I have not heard of anyone being bitten. The
wriggler keeps its head above the surface when rest-
ing, but as it glides quickly into deep water when
disturbed, it is hard to capture. I have never seen
one out of water. Can any Abo. give it a name?
# * * *
“Moon E,” : Crack shots may believe this
or not —I wouldn’t myself only I made the arrange-
ments and lost the drinks. From the verandah
of Cheyne’s Hotel, Coward Springs (S.A.), to the
railway fence was 27 of my paces (I am 6ft. 3in.).
I placed a long blue-headed vesta match upright
on a post. Dick (Price) Maurice, a well-known
squatter-explorer, blew the head off that match
from a seat on the verandah with a Winchester .32.
I saw the smoke ascend. The feat cost me two
rounds.
* * * *
“R.N.8.”: Although the Maori birth-rate
is increasing, Hori still has a cheerful disregard for
the scientific feeding advocated by Plunkct socie-
ties and the like. He persists in his old-style kai-
kai, and the potato is the kid’s chief diet from
three months onward. Fish figures on the menu at
six months, and I’ve seen Maori babies even under
•that age wiring into bits of pork, with Mere sup-
plying black tea from a spoon to wash the stuff
down. Little Hori is still carried “pikau” on his
mother’s back, and not all the pram-makers’ cata-
logues and time-payment terms will shift the custom.
And the kid is winning through. It is only when
Hori attempts to introduce pakeha ideas into the
babj'-raising business that the kids pass on to
Hawaiki.
“Colwyn” : Can some Abo. identify a bird
known about Broken Hill as the diver? It ; s
about the size of a starling, with a short pointed
beak and a fairly long neck; the color is dark
grey or black. These birds are most often seen
swimming in the waterholes after a shower of rain.
When shot at the}' never take to flight, but dive
beneath the surface. They are never sighted when
there is no water about. Their wings are so small
as to appear quite incapable of supporting a long
flight, yet they are to be seen in numbers a few
hours after rain, and must have travelled a con-
siderable distance.
“Rangitira” : At Colac Bay (MX.) a
friend of mine unearthed a skull that presumable'
was once the property of a warrior; at any rate, its
owner evidently kept rough company, for the rear
section had been stove in as if by an old-fashioned
weapon of slaughter. My friend took the gruesome
thing home and left it in the wash-house. Two
nights later he and his wife found they couldn't
sleep. Nor could they the following night; and on
the night after there began a noise like that made
by the butcher when he’s chopping up a shoulder:; of
mutton. Investigation resulted in nothing but the
temporary stoppage of the noise, and as soon as the
head of the house returned to bed it started again.
This went on for a week; then the wife declared,
“It’s that horrible skull.” My friend, after ponder-
ing the matter, took the relic back and buried it at
Colac Bay. The couple slept soundly ever after.
Imagination ? Perhaps ; anyhow', there are the facts.
“Clair Dalmond” looks back
At 13, w'hen I started to learn the art of black-
smithing with my father, part of my duty was 10
bring horses to be shod and take them back to their
stables. It never occurred to me at any time to
lead them —I always rode whether they were bridled
or merely had a bit of rope round the neck. But
the parson’s pony, a very fat little imp, knew too
much for me. Looking back through the years, I
don’t remember one occasion cn ' which he didn’t
dump me on the road on the w T ay home. His mode
of procedure was very simple—he would stop very
suddenly and duck down his head, and I would shoot
forward into the dust or mud, according to w'eather.
I soon learned to dig my knees into his fat sides,
but he knew the moment of relaxation and took it.
He never threw me twice-, nor did he ever run awiv
—just stood still while I remounted —but I used to
think he had a self-satisfied gleam in his eye as
one who would say “Another point to me.” A second
equine character who sticks in my mind was a
Roman-nosed brewery horse called Duke. He took
an amazing delight in being shod. When the time
came, his stableman would open the door, say “Go
on, Duke,” and he would walk off to the smithy and
take up his place at the post. He would lift up his
feet of his own accord as they were wanted, and
after being fixed up he would go back on his own,
contentedly to his stall. One day, when there were
several horses in the shop getting shod, Duke strolled
in. My father, knowing that he had been shod just
a little time before, led him out. He promptly came
back through the other door and lined up again.
HE SALTED IT DOWN.
“What da you do with your wages?—put
part in the savings hank, I hope. "
“Lorblimey, no! After I pay the hatcher,
the baker and the others, I pack what
is left in barrels, mister.”
Once more he was turned out, and once more he
came back. The old dad had a glance at his feet,
saw r that his shoes were all on, then took a batten
to him and chased him out. Passing through the
door, Duke disgustedly let out a kick and drove
a hole through the adjacent wall. He then
walked into the • next compartment —the wheel-
wrights’—and nosed around until all the other
horses were finished, when he came in again and
took his place at the post. Dad then more closely
examined his feet and found he had a loose shoe.
This was fixed up and Duke walked home like
the gentlemajjj he w r as.. A while back, on holnia'.
I visited the old place 'and saw the identical hole
alongside the door of the old shop where Duke left
his mark —-Lord, how many years ago!
WHEN THE GOVERNOR GOES WEST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Admiral de Chair pronounces his name ‘Share.’ ”
It doesn’t much matter, down here in the clatter
And burly and batter of things of the street;
ISut out where the wattles the countryside mottles
I fear there’ll be trouble in plenty to meet.
For you call it De Share, though you spell it De
Chair,
Which is something I dare say will have the chap
beat
Who crawls into the skins of wild rabbits, and grins
From a wild western village’s mayoral seat.
When the Governor goes on a tour of the shows,
As he must, 1 suppose—all good Governors Jo —
W ill they call him just “Mister” in fear of the
twister
That raises a blister on tongues that are new
To the intricacies of his Excellency’s
Nomenclature and freeze on to simple De Chair?—
But I’m happy to think that the stuff that they
drink
In the W'est will decide that his name is Ilio-
Sshare.

And so he went without.

No, this is not a true story.

So he threw it away and put in another.

He did not expect a razor to go

The Alliance Frangaise recommenced
social activities on Friday night at the
Wentworth. It really was a farewell to the
Consular couple. Madame Campana said
her good-byes in a shell-pink brocaded gown
draped closely to her figure; it had a huge
black moire bow and ends perched on the
lift hip. The amiable lady is taking away
a souvenir of her popularity in the form
of an exquisite black opal and the where-
withal to have it sot in Paris. It was pre-
sented by French and Australian women
friends at the home of Mme. Lamerand. The
Campanas will pitch their tents next in
London, where he is to be Consul-General.
The new Consul-General here is M. Nette-
ment. He has had world-wide experience,
and comes here from Tiflis. It may console
the girls who are regretting the jazzing Con-
sul’s departure to learn that the new man is
a bachelor, and not an utter stranger to our
harbor—he was Vice-Consul here in 1902.
The exiles from Erin pinned on their bit
of shamrock and a few yards of emerald rib-
bon—some more ardent souls added the
orange and white of the new Free State —
and let their pent-up sorrows escape in
speeches, jigs and song at the Agricultural
Ground on Saturday afternoon. About 5000
youngsters made the picturesque spectacle of
the crowded programme. They formed a
living map of Ireland, while Archbishop Kelly
smiled seraphically upon them.
Ireland had another night-out at the
Wentworth on Monday, and the pretty little
colleens were cheered heartily for their
dances and ditties. Everyone searched dili-
gently for the four-leafed shamrocks hidden
in some of the caps Mrs. Maclurcan gave
away, and they followed the picturesque
Leprechaun to the foot of the Rainbow as if
they were all lineal descendants of Brian
Boru.
The Adult Deaf and Dumb Society fur-
thered its acquaintance with Lady de Chair
by inviting her to taste the Australia’s brew
and its selection of- cakes and sandwiches.
High tea was served in the drawing-room at
tables aglow with amber dahlias. Before re-
freshments every member of the ladies’ auxili-
ary was presented by Lieut.-Gov. Cullen’s
lady, who escorted the new lioness up from the
vestibule and handed her a delphinium posv.
Her Ex. wore the sheath silhouette, with its
kind of moulded-into-it look. It was of
black crepe romaine, and had a tiny rounded
yoke of jet, a glint of lobelia blue showing
where the _ jupe flowed to give stepping
room. With it she wore the black lace hat
that saw the landing. Little Mrs. Grant
stood beside her, clad in tones of twilight
grey. Jessie Ackland enlivened the com-
pany with sweet song, and William Brooks
spoke a longish piece.
. That sadly-moulted bird the Dove of Peace
is claiming world-wide attention from women.
Lady Aberdeen has convened a conference
for May, to see if the International Council
of Women cannot devise a means of restor-
ing its plumage permanently. It will be
held at one of the halls erected for the
Empire Exhibition. On the same dates,
May 5 and 6, the local N.C.W. will hold
peace deliberations here, and all women who
hate war will send their prayers to Heaven
that the laudable efforts may produce good
fruit.
For generations women and children
travelling alone have been defeated in the
rush for the railway refreshment-room spoil.
Men throw a lot of their chivalry overboard
when they are hungry and thirsty. At long
last the Chief Commissioner has yielded to
the representations of the Country Women’s
Assoc., and has set apart counters for the
use of women and children. The only
objection the Assoc, has to lodge now is that
the signs excluding the male refreshment-
seekers are not conspicuous enough.
The Quambone Bucknells’ daughter
Muriel had no need to worry over the eti-
quette for marking her trousseau. She
married Leslie Bucknell at St. Philip’s on
Saturday night, so the monogram was right
anyway. The black-haired bride supported
a wonderful gown—velvet water-lilies float-
ing on a silver lake was the fabric pattern.
The bridesmaids were powder-blue moire
visions. There were five of them—Gwen
Bucknell, Ella Anning, Dorothy Blacket, Beth
Bucknell, and little Honor McLeish, who
had Cecil Bennett, a blue-clad page, as a
special escort. The toasts were drunk at
Petty’s. The young people will start off for
Scotland soon to visit bridegroom’s mother in
Edinburgh.
Edna Percival, sister of the amateur air-
pilot, was married on Saturday afternoon to
George Eskdale, of the Havana Band. It
was all very sudden, but she found time to
gather a few friends at the Ambassadors,
and he to buy his bride a six-cylinder car.
Just like the Princess out of a fairy talc
looked fair and slender Dorothy Eischer as
she stepped into St. Stephen’s poi'ch in a
twilight of last week. A Jean Baton frock
of white silver tinsel and embroidery
gleamed beneath yards of Brussels and
Honiton point lace. It wrapped around her
golden curls and was clamped to her ears
with big rosettes of orange buds, and then
flowed away into yards of frothing train.
Harold Shepherd wore the masculine bridal
finery, and Ernest Ferguson gave the Rev.
John a pause in the locksmithing business.
Bridegroom’s sister, Rosalie, Miriam Green-
wood, Doreen Pain and Helen Chisholm
Ross, all dressed in rainbow hues, traversed
the aisle in the main body. The bride and
her maids afterwards danced in their silver
shoon at the Wentworth, where the Fischer
parents gave a dinner. After touring Maori-
land Mr. and Mrs. Harold will try country
life at Gunnedali, on one of the numerous
pastures of these Shepherds.
Rene Doust, of Arncliffe, eschewed the
usual bridal trappings when the Rev. John
l 1 erguson asked her one or two leading ques-
tions m front of Victor Stirling, of Manly.
oli6 fluttered into St. Stephen/s in a smart
sand-colored georgette frock and a pretty
brocaded hat of deeper tone, and sister Edna
followed her in hydrangea blue. The Doust
parents arranged for the new matron of the
family to cut the cake at the Cafe Felix—
which has a good name for such an event
at any rate.
Octavius Beale gave his handsome daugh-
ter Hilda to Reg Lamble at St. Paul’s, Bur-
wood, one evening last week. Boy choristers
piping the wedding hymn preceded the
tall silver-clad bride, and sister Mary, Dr.
Edith Allard, Helen Osborn, Doris Prosser
and wee Betty Beale and Rita Lamble,
visions in pink and silver, followed. The
Beale couple gave glad hands to 150 guests
after the ceremony at the family home,
and feasted them in a marquee on the lawn.
Youth danced later in the ballroom, and
Hilda departed in a sapphire velvet evening
cloak that matched her blue eyes perfectly.
This is a picture of Elizabeth Edbrook
Jamieson, a girl whose rich contralto is verv
popular with Sydney audiences. Miss Jamie-
son has made
many appear-
ances with the
Apollos, and
was one of the
most frequent
contralto solo-
ists in the big-
oratorio nights
staged by the
Sydney Choral
Society. That
fairy god-
mother of the
Rawson Insti-
tute, Miss
Margaret Har-
ris, took the
singing girl
under her
wing 1 o n; g
ago, and in-
troduced her
to Margaret
Anglin. The
great actress was so taken with the quality
of the voice that she wanted its owner to
go as her protegee to America to continue
her studies. But at the last moment the
Sydney girl couldn’t leave her native sun-
shine. _ The men who follow the sea are the
beneficiaries, for the singing girl contributes
to almost every programme at the It aw son
Institute.
The Great Synagogue, its brown interior
transformed with greenery and white flowers,
tabernacled the marriage of Gladys Ginsberg,
of Darlinghurst, and Stanley Isaacs, of St.
Kilda, Melbourne. Rabbi Cohen had charge
of the picturesque ceremony. The little bride
made a charming figure in an old-world silver
and ivory brocaded gown. Her sistersvßeckie,
Rose_ and • Freda, and the ’groom’s sisters
Marjorie and Dorothy received the brides-
maids’ gifts. Harold Isaacs stood by. his
brother. The company afterwards had dinner
at the Ambassadors, with intermissions for
dancing. ,
St. Mary’s Cathedral staged a wedding at
precisely the same moment: pretty little
Myra Borchardt was married by Father
Morris to Hubert Millingen of Brisbane.
Satin meteor and tulle draped the fragile
bride. She had a matron of honor (Mrs.
Reg Todman) and cousin Kathleen Bull to
su 1 s l i ain her. Brother Fred handed her over,
while Reg Alderson saw the ’groom through
his paces. Myra’s mother dispensed hospi-
tality at the Rushcutter’s Tennis Club ball-
room.
Nita Derrett, the heroine of the Bronte
shark horror, is having her colossal spirit
further fortified. Mrs. Bessie Grace is organ-
ising a benefit concert for her. Jeweller A.
Saunders, in whose employ she was, has been
pouring out kindnesses upon the brave girl,
and it will be a wrench when the kind man
sets off for London on April 2. There is a
benefit fund open at 805 George-street, Syd-
ney, for all who would like to show appre-
ciation of the girl’s pluck.
Muffie Layton will be an early April
bride. She has a date with the J. J.
Houses’ son and heir at St. Mark’s on the
second.
Betty ChaJmers has been showing her
girl-friends the trousseau she gathered in
Paris last year. She marries her sailor
before this fleeting month ends.
If Farmer’s find their young men rehears-
ing love-scenes for the movies with the new
Paris figures as silent partners, they will
only have themselves to blame. In “Merton
of the Movies” Harry Leon Wilson’s hero
gets his grounding in screen art with the
help of a cheap store-dummy. The new
dummies at Farmer’s are even lovelier than
life —the life of some people, anyhow—and
half the crowds that jostled round the win-
dows last week to look at them were men.
The beautiful things—not the men, of course
—wear the most enchanting new frocks
every day. They all have that school-girl
complexion, their hair is never ruffled, and
their lustrous eyes never grow dim. Their
beautiful hands have a perfectly manicured,
look that is the envy of the flappers.
Nothing like them has been seen before in
these parts, and the living mannequin is
threatened. Styles depicted indicate that
the straight silhouette is still correct. The
most expensive simplicity reigns. Materials
are so rich of weave, intricate of pattern
and diverse in kaleidoscopic coloring that
one wonders what is left to provide novelty
for posterity.
Down (or up) the street David Jones’s
have a futurist family of models that cause
the crowd to pause and start; but immedi-
ately the feminine world lowers eyes from
the grotesque heads to the lovely garments.
Men snigger and pass on. The weird figures
provide a field of lively comment for the tram
drivers and conductors.
A stroll round town brings one to an
almost tearful decision—it is going to be a
most expensive winter.
Shipping-knight James Mills’s wife, of
whose death in London there was cabled
news the other other day, used to be a hand-
some creature of the Junoesque model that
seems to be entirely unknown in this genera-
tion. _ She was one of three sisters, Irish
beauties, who settled in Maoriland years
ago and married well. One became the wife
of Judge Kettle, another the wife of West
Coast Dr. Monsom. The three were noted
for their brilliant complexions of roses and
cream. And of course report had it that
they always bathed from forehead to heel in
fresh milk.
A gloom was cast over a large circle by
the sudden death at the Union Club on
Thursday of Charles King, of Roma Downs
(Q.). He and his wife had only just re-
turned from one of their periodical trips to
London, and so little did they suspect that
anything was amiss that she went to the
Queen’s Club and he to the Bligh-street
establishment for the duration of their Syd-
ney visit. He was a handsome Irishman
whose wit and extraordinary spirits wbre as
much appreciated in Sydney as in Brisbane,
where lie put in a good deal of his time.
His widow was a Miss Rutledge, and is
related to the Bellevue Hill Knoxes through
her aunt, the Chief Justice’s late mother.
Even the Chosen are turning aside to the
contemplation of a new form of Golden Calf,
as it were. Some cash still being required
to pay off the cost of the new Maccabean
Hall, one of the schemes to secure it is to
be a “Maccabean Queen Competition,” the
conflict for the throne to be amongst candi-
dates nominated by different Jewish clubs.
Money stands for votes in queen competi-
tions, and Jewry feels that spirited rivalry
among the daughters of large financial house-
holds should rake in a heavy revenue from
voting coupons.
Even All Fools’ Day is to have its festi-
val. St. Margaret’s Hospital is having a
benefit dinner-dance at the Wentworth, and
a £lO prize will be the reward for the best
—perhaps the worst—fool's cap.
There is (let us be joyful!) one benevo-
lent society in Sydney which has never had
a raffle, a chqcolate-wheel or a fair. It is
the Hebrew Ladies’ Maternity and Benevolent
Society, one of the oldest bodies of its kind
m Australia —it has never been idle for 80
years. With it to help her no Jewish
woman need suffer privation at the time
when she is about to add another one to the
glory of Israel. And the whole cost of
administration was only £l(5 last year.
May Summerbelle, who is off to London,
too, was handed a testimonial last week by
the Mayoress—a cheque for £223. May,
who, besides writing a great deal of news-
paper matter, is a composer of some weight,
is going to try to float her compositions on
the Thames. Arthur Rickard handed a
bouquet of eulogies from the subscribers,
and Mrs. George Taylor, the organiser, left
packing of her trunks, all labelled for
the rsiagara, to bring a bunch of pink roses.
The Autumn Ball in aid of St. Vincent’s,
which is one of Sydney’s regular Easter fix-
tures, will occur this year on Tuesday, April
—-*> (ft the Town Hall. The Mayoress is
president, Mrs. John Lane-Mullins and Mrs.
Odillo Maher are her vices, and Mrs. George
1 tannery leads a'cohort of secretaries and
other officers.
There are great rejoicings among the pro-
moters of the metropolitan effort to help the
Mater Dei Orphanage at Narellan. It took
place at Bondi Casino on Saturday after-
noon; and there were over 500 dancers.
The F. W. Langton and J. M. Dodd
madames were the hon. secs.
If you have ever shaken hands with this
mail you will
r e m ember
Archie Meston.
He prided
himself on liis
iron grip, and
at 70 would
still match
his muscles
against any
p r o f e ssional
Samson. There
is no record
of him as an
archbishop, but
he had been
almost every-
thing else—
politician and
Government
Whip (that
was in Queens-
land), ex-
plorer, protec-
tor of abo-
rigines, journalist, Government agent, lec-
turer. There are acres of Iris bush and abo.
stories in the early volumes of The Bulle-
tin, for nobody ever got further into the
mind of Black Brother of the North than
Archie Meston. And Black Brother never
had a truer friend.
Gladys Owen’s chat on “Art Abroad” so
intrigued her sister artists that she has
yielded to their importunities, and will repeal
the information, with variations, at the
club rooms to-night.
Moree got a good possie on the map
through its mineral baths, and the Countrj
Women’s Association is going to further im-
prove its standing by holding the annual con-
ference there. It will open on May 21. A
welfare nurse is to be taken along, and she
will establish a baby clinic and run it for
the three days of conference. There will
be social happenings as well as business
events. The population of the town will
be augmented by over a hundred delegates,
with nobody knows how many unofficial
enthusiasts.
A Brisbane postscript:—
His Ex. left for the South on the 10th, accompanied
by Dr. .Eneas McDonnell. Before going he was at
the Golf Club dinner ,at Yeerongpilly, presided over
by E. H. Macartney, and said he didn’t know whether
golf made men good tempered or natural amiability
made them golfers. Brig.-General Cannan also talked,
and J. S. Just, who has been on the grand tour,
averred that Yeerongpilly putting greens were equal
to any he had seen in any part of the world. After
that everyone drank his health.
Sir Matthew was also present at the beginning of
the campaign to collect money for a building fund
for the Women’s College at the Uni. The meeting
was held in the Town Hall, and Mayor Diddams, A.
J. Thynne, Peter Macgregor, Archgaiters Sharp, Prof.
Scott Fletcher, Martha Burns, Mrs. Tom Ryan, Mrs.
Parnell and Mrs. Longman all said things to help
the rinatter along.
While the Sanderson Furnisses were here Sir
Matthew had them to lunch, and he also entertained
the Faulkner family, who are off to the Empire Exhi-
bition.
Quite a lot of parties have been given to Marjorie
Byram, who becomes Mrs. Lipscombe shortly. Nora
Halford arranged one at Montpellier, Enid North
another; the Chris Dixons gave a bridge party, as
did Mrs. G. W. Power, and Mrs. Ross Philp staged
yet another shivoo for the bride-elect.
The old Government steamer Lucinda went under
the hammer the other day, when her fittingsj were
sold by auction. The old skipper, Capt. uraig,
wandered disconsolate among the objects he |knew
so well, and had many a yarn to spin about them.
Some of the cushions in the revolving chairs; were
marked with the names of men of note who had sat
upon them, including King George, who went aboard
the lugger When he was here as Duke of York. .Three
deck! seats brought nearly £6 apiece. Mijs. J.
T. Bell, who must remember many a pleasant jaunt
on the old Government steamer in the days • when
her late husband was Home Sec., bought the ship’s
bell.
Alan Collard had a week of parties before leaving
for Sydney on his way to the Cold Country. ; Alan
Cameron and Norman Pixley clubbed together to
stage a dinner-dance at Lennon’s, and the Dailt
Mail people presented him with a wristlet watch.
Kenneth Brampton is making his appearance at
tlie Theatre Royal and Renee Barley also goes on
there.

The Beauty of
Whiter Teeth
The way is easy
quick, delightful
This offers you a pleasant test —a way
to whiter teeth. Millions now employ it.
Many pretty teeth you see and envy are
probably due to its use.
Find out what this method means.
Dingy film-coats
You feel on teeth a viscous film. Much
of it resists the tooth brush, clings and
stays. That is the teeth's great enemy.
Film soon discolors, then forms dingy
coats. That is why teeth grow cloudy.
Film holds food substance which fer-
ments and forms acid. It holds the acid
in contact with the teeth to cause decay-
It breeds millions of germs, and they,
with tartar, are the chief cause of
pyorrhea.
New methods now
Dental science has in late years found
ways to fight that film. One acts to
disintegrate the film, one to remove it
without harmful scouring.
Protect the Enamel
Pepsodent disintegrates the film,
then removes it with an agent far
softer than enamel. Never use a
film combatant which contains
harsh grit.

Able authorities proved those methods
effective. Then a new-type tooth paste
was created to apply them daily. The
name is Pepsodent. Careful people of
some fifty nations are employing it to-day.
Other great helps
Pepsodent also multiplies the alkalinity
of the saliva. Also its starch digestant.
Those are there to neutralize acids and
digest starch deposits which form. Every
use of Pepsodent gives them manifold
effect.
These results are bringing a new dental
era. You will never go without them
when you learn how much they mean.
Send for the io-Day Tube. Note how
clean the teeth feel after using. Mark
the absence of the viscous film. See how
teeth whiten as the film-coats disappear.
The results will amaze and delight you.

The State Ministers’ wives combined to
spread a welcome, for Mrs. Stanley Bruce
on her return from the jaunt across seas. It
transpired in the Federal House club-room.
Great polished boards at either end radiated
like twin sunsets under a garden of roses,
which blushed in a picturesque crescendo
from palest pink to deep red. Mrs. Earle
Page, in black marocain, with feathers tick-
ling her becoming hat crown, and the
Groom lady, with filmy grey georgette mist-
ing a rosy under-sheath, and a white plumed
hat, had the assistance of blue-frocked Mrs.
Stewart in how-d’ye-doing the guests. Mrs.
Bruce moved gracefully in foamy black, with
grey feathers dripping over both sides of her
black hat-brim. She says she is glad to be
back, and wears a slimmer figure and a
sweeter smile than before; but she is not
one of those women who take to public life
like a duck to green peas. Mrs. Marks is
of the few among her sex who can carry
one of the new gossamer-like back capes suc-
cessfully. Mrs. Keating wore her winsome
smile under a white, flower-wreathed hat.
Ever-popular Mrs. Alfred Deakin and Mrs.
“Pompey” Elliott upheld the vogue for black;
so did King O’Malley’s wife, who, however,
patched it with a cheerful blue. Little
Jessie Groom, who upset the family’s Christ-
mas plans by falling out with her appendix
in Sydney, dimpled sweetly under a ravishing-
little pink lid.
The Victoria League turned on a welcome-
CMm-farewell for the Countess Harrowby in
the Alexandra Club the other afternoon.
Lady Frances Ryder, who was to have
shared the honors with her mother, could
not get there. Mrs. Harry Emmerton, as
chairwoman of the hospitality group of the
League, acted as hostess-in-chief, and the
Dunbar Hooper and Wren matrons—the
League hostesses for the month—seconded
her. The thing was beautifully done, from
the food to the flowers. The Countess
Stradbroke, as president of the League in
this State, dropped in, wearing brown silk
under a little blue hat, with a bunch of
feathers on the port side. Daughter Helena
came with her. and another star guest was
Mrs. Stanley Bruce, in black.
Fritz Hart released a second edition of his
cantata, “The Song of Mary,” at the East
Melbourne Con. for the special benefit of
Dame Patroness Nellie, who brought Mrs.
Pitt Rivers under her plump wing. Mrs.
Fritz reinforced the welcome to the pair with
a huge posy of early violets for the Dame
and red roses for the Viceroy’s daughter.
At the finish, after a palpitating send-off by
the enthusiastic Con. gathering, Melba, with
that business instinct which has helped her
keep her waggon hitched to a star, rushed her
companion to the Palace Theatre, just in
time to witness the reconciliation of Comte
Hicks d’Artois and Comtesse Ellaline.
That over, the Dame rose dramatically in
her stage box and hurled the presentation
violets stageward; but, the flowers being-
light and the Melba aim bad, they flew into
the astonished face of a lady seated in the
adjacent pen, who politely returned them for
a second shy, - which this time laid them at
the Hickses’ feet. Mrs. Pitt Rivers’s roses
followed, but their course, too, was erratic,
and they hurtled bang into the orchestra.
The players, with instruments poised for
Gorsave, eyed the flowers doubtfully; then,
after a breathless pause, the first ’cello, with
a hang-it-all air, lowered his bow and tossed
the bunch of rosy fragrance across the foot-
lights, where Ellaline grabbed it before the
curtain dipped to the boards.
The Robert Dundas pair tried to look
more cheerful than they felt when they
parted with their one ewe lamb, Gwen, to
John Curtis McCaul at Christ Church, South
Yarra. The bride’s white silk brocade was
anchored mid-front with a brilliant glitter,
while a droopy white silk hat with a silver
swathe replaced the conventional tulle
misting. Pink tiger-lilies were cradled on
one arm. Crawford McCaul. down from
the Malay States with his brother, best-
manned, and Yvonne Deschamps ’maided.
The latter suggested a heroine of Early Vic-
torian romance in a full skirt of buttercup
silk, a close-fitting bodice berthed with rare
old lace and a brown tulle hat. None but
the most intimate friends sat down to the
bridal feast, which was eaten at No. 9 Dar-
ling-street. The newly-weds leave for the
Malay States at the end of the month.
The Austral, having been ejected from its
old dug-out by the big blaze which ate out
the interior of Hardware Chambers, waits
Micawberwise for something to turn up large
enough to house its numerous activities.
The closest search has so far failed to dis-
cover anything suitable. The members’
afternoon welcome to Mrs. Tom Baker and
sister Eleanor Shaw, just back from a year’s
trot round the globe, was staged rather
crowdedly in the Women’s Automobile Club.
The star guests made a somewhat bashful
entry, to the accompaniment of a thin cres-
cendo of “three times three.” Woman may
have proved herself mere man’s equal in
most things, but he can still maintain his
superiority when it comes to cheers. The
musical course, which came between the
how-d’ye-do and the pekoe, was toned up by
an extra-special brand of baritone imported
by the owner, W. E. McKinley, from Maori-
land, while Frank Hanna and Dolly Stewart
twinkled brightly in the local constellation.
Priminister Bruce and his wife have un-
loaded their piled-up stack of steamer trunks
in Shipley House, the Dick Casey widow’s
old South Yarra home. The James Haynes
pair, who tilled it for a year or so, have
swelled the rush across seas to the Exhibi-
tion. Mrs. Haynes was the youngest Prell
daughter, a sister of George Fairbairn’s first
wife.
The Alec Nicholsons’ younger girl, Eileen,
and Allan McFarlane, of S. Aus., met by
appointment at the Collins-stret kirk to have
their matrimonial ties adjusted by veteran
Dr. Marshall. The bride was wrapped in
mummy-like swathings of white brocade,
backed by a silver tram under the usual flow
of tulle veiling. Two little Tliornley
cousins. Judith and Peter, with extra help
from the ’groom’s cousin, Philippa McFar-
lane, supported the silvery tail, the boy
armored in silver and the girls in rose-
colored taffetas shot with silver. Cousin
Mary Macpherson (the girl whose military-
medical father caused such a stir by trying
to lead his daughter back to Canada
on a legal leash) and the ’groom’s sister
Mollie were flounced in rose and silver, with
balloon skirts, which seemed to shriek in
protest at the slinky bridal drapings. Dick
Leggoe, from S. Aus., convoyed the bride-
groom. The after-jollo was at No. 9 Dar-
ling-street, where the bride’s mother stood in
black marocain, with a stream of bluish
green trickling down one side, and a
feathered hat.
Scarlet gladioli winked hospitably from
ambushes of gum-branches on the afternoon
the Women Automobiljsts gave greeting to
the Melba Scholarship winner, Alma O’Dea.
The little Queenslander came in under con-
voy of Kathleen Malone, and was met by
the president, Mrs. H. J. Robertson, with
kind words and an early-Victorian posy.
There was tea and chatter, and the musical
interval was made glad by violinist Ger-
trude Healey, Leonora Scott, Violet Parkin-
son. Harold Webb, Horace White and Bertha
Colling.
The girl with the dimpled chin, snapped
here by Ruskin, is Lady Pat Blackwood, the
late Marquis of Dufferin’s youthful daughter,
vv ho, having
been tipped as
a winner by
George Tallis,
is now testing
her mumming
ability as a
show girl with
a few lines to
say in the
“Cabaret
Girl.” Lady
Patricia is a
versatile young
thing, smart
with both pen-
cil and paint-
brush, and
quite talented
as a musician.
She declares
she will make
good on her
own merits,
and to that
end she lias jettisoned her name for
stage purposes, taking in its place Pamela
Dartrey, which she has picked off a back
branch of the family-tree, and hopes it will
bring her luck. Last week she faded out of
the Government House entourage, and has
unpacked at Cliveden Mansions, where she
will share a flat with opera-director Henry
Russell and his clever wife.
From a man who has been through it:—
Now that the Special Service Squadron is approach-
ing these parts, a few items of naval lore may come
in useful. The Commanding Officer of the Squadron
—it is not a Fleet—is a Vice- Admiral, and the Second
in Command is a Rear-Admiral, and, incidentally,
a son of N.S.W.’s one-time Governor, Viscount Hamp-
den. You don’t speak of being “on a ship”; the
correct term is “in a ship,” and people go “on shore,”
not “ashore.” Naval men always salute the quarter-
deck when passing over the gangway, and it won’t
be taken amiss if shore people “dip their lids.” A
lieutenant wears two stripes on his sleeve, a com-
mander three and a post-captain four. A midship-
man can be the captain of a ship, but an officer of
the rank of captain is said to be a post-captain.
All officers wear the executive curl above the stripes;
surgeons can be distinguished by the scarlet band
between the gold stripes; the engineers wear a purple
band, and the paymasters a white one. If you see
a corpulent gent, wearing a silver star on his sleeve
you will be pretty safe in hailing him as the ship’s
cook. The flag at the masthead of the Hood with
a red ball in the upper left-hand corner is the flag
of the Vice-Admiral. The Delhi, which is the flag-
ship of the Rear-Admiral, carries his flag, with a
red ball in both the upper and lower cantons. Officers
of the rank of commander and above wear gold oak-
leaves on the peak of their caps, and the reason
why midshipmen wear three brass buttons on their
cuffs is that in Nelson’s day they used to wipe
their noses thereon, and the little Admiral wouldn’t
have it. But you needn’t say anything about that.
This is Thomas Hatton, the young Austra-
lian dramatic tenor whom ill-health has
brought home for a spell. On the recom-
mendation of
Melba and the
late Marshall
Hall he took
his voice to
Europe about
10 years ago,
and was hav-
ing it fur-
bished for the
operatic stage
when the war
broke out. He
served in the
aeronautical
branch of the
Ministry of
Munitions, and
after the Arm-
istice, resumed
(; ra i n ing at
Milan. He was,
however, laid
low by a ner-
vo u s break-
down, and it was some time before he could
return to work. When at last he got strong
lie forged ahead as one of the principal
dramatic tenors of the Carl Rosa Opera
Co., singing in “The Rheingold” and “I
Pagliacci” at Manchester, Bristol and Lon-
don. Later on he harnessed in his great
rones for lighter duties with the D’Oyly
Carte Co. in Gilbert and Sullivan opera,
and here again he was a success.
Claude Grice, who gets a good deal of
limelight as an amateur steeplechase rider,
entered for the Matrimonial Stakes a day or
two ago at Toorak St. John’s. The other
entrant was a Corowa belle, the elder daugh-
ter of the Harry Ogilvie widow. The
bride’s satin draperies swathed her figure,
according to the mode of the moment, with
a side-anchor of glittering paste. The back
trail of satin was frothed creamily down
one side with old Honiton lace lent by Mrs.
Grice, and orange buds moored the "golden
misting of lace-edged tulle which had veiled
the bridegroom's grandmother on her wed-
ding day. Sister Helen Ogilvie and Eliza-
beth Weigall provided rival studies in
beauty, both sheathed in snowy crepe, with
blue and pink tulle—the bridegroom’s
racing colors—fluttering lengthily from
filmy head swathes. Little Suzanne
Howatson, all pink frills, held her new
auntie’s train out of the dust, with the
undecided air of one who is not sure whether
the occasion calls for smiles or solemnity.
(As a matter of fact, it calls for a bit of
each.) Uncle A. W. Hopkins escorted the
bride, and Geoff Grice seconded his brother
with the helji of J. B. Howatson. Limou-
sines and taxis were not needed to move the
guests from the church to the health-drinking
ceremony, in the home of the bridegroom’s
only sister, Mrs. Alec Howatson —they just
walked across the road.
Melba viewed the Albert-street Con.’s per-
formance of “Dido and iEneas” from one of
the upstair pens of the Playhouse on Satur-
day night, a white fur coat warming her
pink silken hangings. The audience was
convulsed after the second act, when the
male quartette solemnly advanced to kiss
the hand of the diva, who took the salute
in regal fashion. Lady Stradbroke, with
daughter Charlotte and Miss Currie, sat in
the opposite box, after being “Gor’saved” on
her entry by an enthusiastic orchestra, which
forgot that the National Anthem is not one
of the lady’s perquisites. In the audience
was white-bearded Thomas Brentnall, good
friend of musicians, just back from his Eng-
lish visit.
The A. E. V. Richardson pair helped to
cheer Dolly Stewart for her American trip
on Saturday night with a beautifully-staged
party in their Claremont Hall reception-
rooms, which effervesced with music, bridge,
dancing and chatter. The musical pro-
gramme provided a glitter of stars. Victor
Baxter was there with his dramatic tenor,
and Edwin Hames and Cecil Parkes with
their fiddles. Mrs. Zelman, who came along
after her husband’s concert, sang, and so
did the hostess and Dolly Stewart. A big
nuota from the “Man in Dress Clothes” co.
dropped in after the show, headed by Fred-
erick Lloyd and including Miono Stewart.
Phyllis Fuller and Norman Lee. The Monty
Grovers had a flutter at bridge: Eileen
Castles was. there with sister Dolly Finn
and her medical husband, and Dorothy Mur-
doch brought a bright little golden-liaired
sister. The James Angus and Hidgcock
matrons, big Major Maclnerny and his fair-
liaired wife and daughter, the medical Jona
pair and Dr. Nihill were also sighted among
those who enjoyed a really wonderful party.
Alberto Zel man had a good house for his
musical evening at the Town Hall on Satur-
day. The hoi polloi were entranced, and
the ushers staggered forward under bales of
flowers when the conductor’s bright Madame
climbed the hurdy-Verdian stairs of “Ah Fors
e Lui" and waved her soprano unimpaired
from the top. Her frock of pink and silver
was like a dawn in the tropics, and a silver
head-dress that trickled in a chain of beads
over the ears added to the effect. Beyond
the pink confection of the other soloist,
Bertha Jorgensen, the audience had nothing
to glue its eyes on but the purple flower
nestling on the black-velveted hip of the
first violin. Bessie Gaunson. Alberto was
in. his usual form with the baton, but in the
midst of the uproar of one of Edward Ger-
man’s dances he stopped abruptly to repri-
mand a. small section in the front seats for
whispering. Ilow the irritated maestro
heard the alleged sibilation amid the riot
that his orchestra was creating is a mystery
—to most people the interruption would have
been something like the twitter of a silk-
worm on a battlefield.
Mayoress Hocking, of Camberwell, will
have her Market Fair stall crowded as a
result of a gift afternoon at the J. G.
Lathams’ Malvern bungalow, Flete, once the
home, of Justice Hartley Williams. Mrs.
Hocking stood with the M.H.R. and his wife
on the wide verandah to meet the inrush of
gift-bearers, who dropped their bundles in a
mammoth basket, or tossed coins on an out-
spread sheet whitening a grassy plot. Vere
de Bavay, Ursula Bere, Helen Outhwaite
and Gwen Bedgood, contributed an attrac-
tive exhibition tennis contest; Miss Coy
directed a musical outburst in the drawing-
room ; flower brigands reaped a silver har-
vest in the library, and Mrs. Latham and
some pretty girls fed everyone in the dining-
room. Mrs. Hocking thanked Mrs. Latham
prettily for her help, and Dr. Connie Ellis
thanked all who are boosting the hospital fund.
Sister Adelaide feels like a wet rag:—
Fleet Week began and ended with dances for the
men —on Monday at the Palais, with the 41 hostesses,
and on Friday at the Town Hall under the hospitable
wing of the Barr Smiths. At both shows there was
much braid and buttons. Indeed, Monday’s dance
had quite an official flavor, for the Bridges came along
after their dinner at Government House and brought
most of their guests with them, including Admiral
Field and his staff. Lady Bridges studded her gold
tissue with sapphires and rubies, slung a rope or
two of pearls about her neck, and footed it merrily.
Friday’s list of guests was much the same —minus
the Bridges and the Admiral, who was giving a
dinner aboard the Hood. Mrs. Barr Smith received
her guests (800 or so) in slim draperies of blue and
fuchsia georgette. The show was from 7.30 till 11,
to give the men easy time for their last trains, and
an hour or so before closing-time officers and the
younger dancing set betook themselves to the Gordon
MacFarlanes’ house in North Adelaide, where another
dance was a-swing as an absolute and final Fleet
flutter.
It has been a hectic week for dancers. Tuesday’s
frivol at Government House was for junior officers
and the younger set only (17 of them debs.), but
even with that limitation there was not much spare
room. The debs, included the eldest of the Hackett
maidens, in gold lace and tissue; the Claude Lucases'
slim daughter in white georgette ; one of the Barwcll
daughters; the Justice Pooles’ eldest girl, and Ruth
Hope, in gold and white tissue. Lady Bridges was in
black tulle, with embroideries of blue and pink and
crystal beads.
The Mayoral Ball was perforce crammed into the
Town Hall, which gave the Glovers nightmare
moments in making out their lists. Hitherto mayoral
balls have overflowed into the Exhibition Building,
but that tactless pile made itself unavailable at the
moment. Mrs. Glover said her how-d’ye-do’s in
draped black satin with gold lace. Miss Murray
plumped for black, too, and Lady Bridges was in
vivid pink chiffon velvet.
As side-lines we have had tennis parties in the
hills, with the Tom Barr Smiths, Michael Hawkers,
George Cowans, H. H. Wiggs and J. 11. Symons
among the hosts; cricket at St. Peter’s College .with
a team of officers on one side and a red-and-blue
combination of St. Peter’s and Prince Alfred boys
against them; golf tournaments, lunches at the Com-
monwealth and Rotary Clubs, and such teas and
lunches and dinners and private parties as this rai-
lage never dreamt of when the Renown was here.
It remained for whoever made arrangements for
getting sight-seers from Glenelg to the battleships
and back again to provide the weak link in the chain
of organisation. There weren’t enough boats to do
it, and the traffic up and down the jetty resembled
nothing so much as a free fight on the opening day
of a drapery bargain sale. Infuriated trippers bought
steamer tickets and never got within coo-ee of the
steamers, and anguished officers found their ships
cluttered up till all hours by sight-seers who’d been
dumped aboard and not called for again.
There are one or two minor wails, too, concern-
ing officers who turned up to find their hosts didn t
expect them, and hostesses who bedizened their spare-
rooms and sat waiting for officer guests who never
turned up. But those are details. The muddle in
the jetty and transport arrangements was nearer a
scandal.

MICK SIMMONS
DO THE JOB
PROPERLY
Though a failure in Melbourne last
month—racing from left to right suited him no more
than it did David—Stony is a pretty good horse at
Kandwick. In the 11-furlongs Warwick Handicap
on Saturday he returned the expenses of his Victorian
trip and a bit over by winning resolutely at 2’s,
gallopmg from 11th to first in five furlongs and
cutting down the unbacked Master Cagou in the last
oO yards. When Kelso had him, the brown Kenil-
S e ltkng couldn’t go a mile and a quarter,
but the years have toughened him as they did Laddie
Blue, a inner who furnished into a Metrop. horse,
and/with idUi. less than the Bst. 61b. he carried
ahead of Master Oagou, Validolid and the improving
Uuet, Stony has a chance in the Sydney Cup. The
one horse behind him at the five-furlongs post was
Balaton, who ended up a respectable fifth. Another
"P candidate to shape decently was Comptroller,
who finished just behind the place-getters in the
mile Liverpool Handicap, won by the grey Mv
loppo mare, Doris Lynn (B’s). This nice Sir. Dighton
horse also has 7st. 51b., and, with El Dorado and
italh out of the race, nothing looks more enticing
at the moment.
Trilisa, whose Doncaster Handicap prospects have
if en ri usse d at the sporting clubs, reappeared in
he living Handicap, but there wasn’t a shilling for
her and she was never prominent. Girton Girl
took the lead early and kept it, is not
m the Doncaster—from which, by the way, The Hawk
and trowdennis have been withdrawn—but Bathos
and lnmacre, second and third respectively, have
been nominated for the rich mile race, though neither
is much fancied. There was a rush to back Golden
voice m the first division of the Nursery Handicap,
and it was evens the favorite, 8 to 1 Irish Prince
when the bookmakers shut their bags. The Prince,
°* Dick Wootton’s, by imported Itangag—
wish Rose, caught the Demosthenes gelding, from
?T? he was receiving 2st., about the half-distance
■nd beat him home by a neck. Pike was vociferously
blamed tor the favorite’s reverse. His reply was
that (.olden Voice “died in my hands,” just as
soorak did in the 1922 A.J.C. Derby. On that
occasion also the best of all the Randwick jockeys
was accused of having “chucked it away,” whereas
he nursed a tiring non-staver so artistically that
Kivoli only headed him in the last few strides —
he really rode the race of his life. Many expect
(.oiden voice to down Heroic at Easter, but the
iT 1 . s <r, more likely t 0 be achieved by the better of
John “Brown’s” Wallace Isinglass pair, Bunting Wal-
lace and Leslie Wallace.

The lightweights engaged in the St. Kilda
eup at Caulfield were put to shame by The Rover and
■Switch, with Bst. 131 b. and Bst. 81b. respectively,
in a tight finish the topweight was beaten a head by
the mare, who must have lost more money for
punters than she has put to their credit. Three-vear-
old Lance, with 6st. 121 b. up, was only a head behind
, e Rover, and Drongo was not far away; but it
(ioesn t say much for the form of the young ones that
Wren s aged gelding, backed down to 2 to 1, was good
enough to beat them, though not quite good enough
to win However, a three-year-old sprinter in
Helicopter won the South Yarra Handicap, in accord-
arne with a whisper which had threatened danger
from him before the late V.R.C. meeting. After
the lace the stewards wanted to know why Helicopter
had run badly in the Leonard Stakes a week earlier,
the explanation was accepted.
r t-reen’s two-year-old Valdes must have sur-
E?f e £, people by winning at Caulfield. With
J, K " ; , lls0 " aboard the gelding was allowed to go
out at 10 s, but he needed no aid from luck to get
him home. Valdes is another of the Valais family,
which has been remarkably successful this season.
Quintus, Heroic, Valorem, Valdoona (a Doncaster
possibility with 7st. 121 b. if her party doesn’t prefer
the St. Leger, on the same day) have all won
recently for the English sire.
* * * *
“0.K.”: Backwood, the unaccountable
English horse, was put on the Bst. 31b. mark for the
V.A.T.C. St. Hilda Cup, whereas the A:J.C. adjudicator
has given him Bst. 71b. for Sydney Cup. In strict
justice, the animal should have been handicapped on
his spring-autumn form and reduced to 7st. 71b. or
the minimum. On his running in Australia,
Backwood is as complete a duffer as was
Coq d’Or, a previous unfortunate importation in
Bradfield’s stable, where several English-bred cracks
have been prepared for notable victories. Coq d’Or
went to pieces after coming to the Commonwealth,
and Backwood seemingly has gone to blazes. A fine-
looking beast, with a good English reputation as a
stayer, he threatened to make rapid improvement
when he appeared in public last September. There
was ginger in his behavior before the race, and a
bit of dash in his running. A few weeks later the
blessed horse appeared to have grown quite amiable
in the “birdcage” and spiritless when called upon to
race. Backwood may be born again anon, but he
is more likely to bring sorrow to optimistic punters.
* * * *
“Tink” : I don’t think it lias been printed
that on Newmarket day at Flemington a punter could
have backed every horse in every race and shown a
decent profit. Operating on a pound-a-prad basis, he
would have been in £ll on the Hurdle when Dalcross,
at 20’s, beat nine others. This would have been in-
creased to £2B in the St. Leger; Sandringham won
at 20’s in a field of four. Then came a gutser:
The Hawk, at 7 to 2 on, beat four opponents in
the Essendon Stakes, and bang went £3 14s.
Twenty-eight faced the barrier in the Newmarket,
and the victory of Quintus, at 25’s, left a deficit of
£2 on the race. Arendal, at 14’s, by stoushing
Heroic and six others in the Sires’ Produce, aug-
mented the profit by £7, and Benoni didn’t diminish
it by winning the last race at 10’s in a field of 11.
The punter would have been £29 6s. in pocket
on the day.
* * * *
“liambone”; Beauford’s failure to stand
another preparation does not surprise those who have
followed his career closely. Foaled in a drought
season, the brown was never robust and required
the greatest care. It was something of a feat to
get him cherry-ripe for his great Epsom coup in
1921. Beauford was a great one-race horse, as. he
showed in the Epsom, in the 1922 Autumn Stakes when
he beat Eurythmic, and in the first of his four
contests against Gloaming; but preparations for a
series of weight-for-age struggles are not for the
weak, and five of them have gradually exhausted
the flying miler’s small store of hardiness. The
knowing scratched him off when The Hawk trounced
him last September. That was the last flicker of a
once-great galloper.
“F.A.”: It was settling-day at the Short-
odds Club, and a punter who was well behind it
hadn’t arrived. The word went round that he had
“taken the knock,” and when Prosser, the sporting
lawyer, meandered in it was mentioned to him as an
indisputable fact —Bliwers had “’opped it.” “Non-
sense,” said Prosser. “Tell you what I’ll do —-I'll
ring up his house.” He returned in five minutes to
say that Bliyvers hadn’t been seen since dinner-time
the night before. “I don’t like it,” commented a
moody ringman. “Doesn’t look too good,” said
another. “I’d sell out cheap,” chipped in a third.”
“You can have my lot, Mr. Prosser,” interposed a
fourth, “for ten bob in the pound.” “Me too,”
shouted several others in chorus. “All right,” "e-
-plied Prosser. “Wait till three o’clock, and if he
hasn’t turned up then you can pool the lot anil
I’ll give you ten bob in the pound.” The bargain

gation, the “mob” stole away.
N.S.W.’s farcical select committee of
inquiry into pony-racing, which began last year by
eliciting a flood of malodorous statements about this
most unsavory sport and then suddenly went to
ground, is to resume investigating next month.
e . , In £ I s typical of our cynically expensive
official methods. Every racing man in the State,
and many who only race spasmodically, have a
shrewd idea of what is chiefly wrong with pony-
racing. A junior barrister of a dozen years’ stand-
ing or a reputable solicitor, assisted by a couple of
business men, could elicit the material facts and put
them before the public inside a month. This inquiry,
being a political one, may still be in progress next
year, and even when the report is forthcoming it
will carry less weight than it should. To look
, at" unbiased ar *d judicial decision- from a party

notable triumphs of optimism on record.

Whitehall : The passionate requests of
the British Labor papers to the Prince of Wales to
give up hunting and ’chasing like a man and go in
for something more edifying will provoke grins
amongst those who know the English working-man.
If the Prince had carefully thought out a scheme for
gaining the esteem of the section that sheets like
the Daily Hekald are struggling to win for Bolshev-
ism he could not have done better than take to race-
riding. It is an odd fact that the sober-sided
Englishman admires a festive spirit in his Sovereigns.
Edward VII. owed much of his popularity to his
notorious love of cards, women and Newmarket.
The respectable Victoria was thoroughly disliked
during most of her reign. The present King and
Queen arouse about as much enthusiasm, day in day
out, in the breasts of their subjects as the Bank of
England. They are solid and reliable, but unexcit-
ing. The Prince is what every law-abiding, cliurch-
going, over-taxed and under-fed Briton of the post-war
era would wish to be. A bespectacled and earnest
young man of the Bible-banging type with strong
social and political principles would merely arouse
contempt and revulsion, and in addition would land
the dynasty in trouble in no time. The only avenue
for criticism that the Prince leaves open to his
enemies is a matter of the quality of his horsemanship,
and even here he is either lucky or Machiavtllian.
Every fall brings him closer to the hearts of his
countrymen, while if he broke his neck his line
should be safe, bar accidents, for at least a century.
No wonder the republicans want him to drop sport
for politics.

“H. Singe.”: The genesis of the “Boy”
Charlton row was the impression, created originally
by prominent cricketers and tennis players, that those
behind Australia’s sporting organisations can be bull-
dozed into anything. It was logical enough for
Charlton and his admirers to imagine that Tommy
Adrian could be forced on the strength of the-
Olympic team. If a tennis-player’s wife why not a
swimmer’s trainer? The fault' seems to have been
chiefly in the Charlton family’s technique, which is
too wordy and temperamental altogether. Charlton
began with a definite statement:—
“I will not go unless Adrian goes also. I made up
my mind about that some time ago.”
A J. O. Anderson would have sat down cn that and
awaited the march of events. Also he would have
handled all subsequent developments himself. In
Charlton’s case, practically the entire family rushed
loquaciously into the breach. His father, interviewed,
said; “Unless Adrian goes ‘Boy’ stays. That is ■
definite.” Then came the news of a letter written by
the champion to O. G. Merrett, manager of the team,
containing a refusal to go under any circumstances.
His father expressed ignorance of this letter, com-
bined with bewilderment. It next appeared that
the letter had not been posted and was still in the
possession of Charlton’s sister. Whereupon Charlton,
senior: “I now withdraw my permission to ‘Boy’
to go to Europe. He shall never do so while I am
alive.” A grandfather next moved into the limelight
with an intimation that he disapproved of the whole
project on moral grounds. He touched with con-
siderable eloquence on the temptations of foreign
parts, and hinted that unless “Boy” withstood them
he (the grandfather) would reconsider certain
financial schemes he had in view. And once more
Charlton, senior, proclaimed in effect that “Boy”
would onlv make the trip over his progenitor’s
corpse. The upshot is that Charlton is to go, and
that his Manly admirers are to pay for Adrian.
The absurd disturbance will have done good if it sets
a precedent for the quashing of other movements of
the kind. Mr. Merrett won all along the thundering
line of press publicity, because he knew his own mind
and has the gift of silence.
* * * *
“Centurion”: I read that the Murray
Bridge (S.A.) eight, besides competing at Argenteuil
(B. 13/3/’24). will enter for events at Henley. If
they do, the English Rowing Association will in all
probability reject their nomination with contumely.
There is no more conservative body in existence than
the E.R.A. Though out of touch with public opinion
and destitute of press support, it is still in unchal-
lenged control of English rowing. Its famous rule
that no person earning his living by manual labor
may rank as an amateur, however much he is one
in other respects, has weathered the blasts and
blankies of three decades. The Murray Bridgers are
manual workers to a man. Their amateur status,
even according to the strict Australian ruling, is
unassailable. But that won’t pass them through the
E.R.A. portals. Our last Olympic crew had some
trouble to satisfy the Tin Gods that they had never
shifted anything heavier than a bank ledger. Even
the glamor of the A.I.F. barely availed to permit
the service crew to compete for the King’s Cup. That
being a special war-fever stunt, however, the E.R.A.
looked the other way. Later on, it probably erased
all records of the shocking affair, if it ever made any.
"Trekle”: In tlie first 25 years of inter-
state cricket, Sam Cosstick (B. 13/3/’24) was easily
the most destructive bowler; lie took 78 N.S.W.
wickets at an average of 9.78. Carpenter, the best
bat in England, played against Sam when here with
Parr’s unbeaten XI, and years later, after seeing
Spofforth, Allan, Boyle and Garrett, pronounced him
a better bowler than any of them. Cosstick was
the favorite pro. at the Melbourne Cricket Ground
lor many years. Socially he was a rough diamond,
very much at home in the convivial gatherings so
popular in those good old days ; then he would always
sing his two songs, “A-liunting We Will Go” and
“We Came to a River and We Couldn’t Get Across,’’
amid great applause and a gathering crowd of pew-
ters. Once, and once only, was he called on for
a speech. “Genelmen,” lie said, ,“I done me best,
and I don’t care a dam’ for no one.” Then he sat
down.
* * * *
O. P. Asher, who was highly thought of
a few years ago but unaccountably fell away, has
been distinguishing himself in the closing stages
of the Sydney cricket premiership. Against Glebe
he took 15 wickets for 97 and against Western
Suburbs 10 for 62. Altogether, the Sydney slow
bowler has bagged 63 wickets averaging 15.07.
There are still a few matches to be played, but
Gordon, which includes Macartney and Kelleway,
who has had a great season with both bat and bail,
can’t lose the premiership.
“Lexite”: The N. S. Wales L. T. A. is
emitting the uneasy growls of a good watchdog
which has a feeling that something is wrong. The
growls are threats towards players found introducing
the wedge of professionalism; and the Assoc, talks
about raising barricades to keep the hated thing
out. But if professionalism means making a living
out of the game the L.T.A. ought to know that it
has arrived. And very little is to be gained by pro-
hibiting “unauthorised exhibitions” ; there are other
ways in which prowess with the racquet can be
turned to account. A man I know who owns houses
and tennis-courts has engaged a well-known racquet-
spinner to collect his rents. The presence of a star
player enhances the popularity of the courts, which
would be a paying proposition anyhow, and what
with his coni, and the privilege of inhabiting a
dwelling rent-free, the lilvwhite pro. doesn’t have to
soil his hands by belting iron or shinning up a
ladder with bricks.
“15-80” : A tiling that impressed me dur-
ing the recent tennis tournament in Melbourne was
the stodginess of the women players. The trouble
is £hat they strive for championship honors on an
equipment that wouldn’t carry an ambitious male
beyond C grade. They develop a straight service
and a good drive, but grow up abysmally ignorant
of the volley in all its forms. The stop- and lob-
vollevs are unknown even among the top-notchers;
the half-volley is so crudely executed that it merely
adds to the indignity of the player’s situation';
and the ordinary straight volley is merely a defen-
sive shot forced upon them by the fact that a
return has come full on to the racquet. Personally
I think the ladies are handicapped by their readiness
to listen to old-fashioned tutors. , I know of two
or three cases of promising girls artlessly swallow-
ing the notions of unqualified elders who happen to
be close relatives or friends. These patriarchs pose
as Solons of the game, though they have never
played it to any extent, and their advice is generally
so conservative that it hampers self-development.
* * * *
. After having had none the worse of seven
warm rounds, at Sydney Stadium, with an improved
Archibald Bradley, Plees, the Belgian, signalled for
the towel to be thrown in. In his dressing-room he
explained that he was feeling the effects of the in-
fluenza which had caused a three w r eeks’ postponement
of the bout. Perhaps he was; when ’flu gets a
good grip on an athlete it is apt to distress him more
than even the Queensland welter’s neckhold. But
it was announced beforehand that the Fleming had
fully recovered.

“Yenrug”: Dempsey could doubtless k.o.
Court Oakes, the former Tas. heavyweight champion,
but in one respect Court is the Yank’s master. He
has just given a name to his 15th infant. The acorn;
are all living and the eldest is married. Their dad
is 39, and can still fight a bit, but nowadays he is
mostly third man in the ring.
* * * *
“Past Grammar”: The first M.L. • Rugby
team to cross the Line was the so-called Native XV
of 1888-89. Queerly enough, Scotland refused to meet
that side, just as it has refused to meet the combina-
tion that will leave for Britain in July. The Natives
(they included several Europeans) won 49 out of 74
games in Britain and Ireland, losing 20 and drawing
5. Counting games in Britain, N.S.W., Queensland,
Victoria and Maoriland, they played 108 matches in
12 months, including four months spent in travel-
ling, and won 80 of them. E. McCausland, one of
the side, is a bank official in Sydney to-day. The
writer, then a boy at school in England, can remem-
ber the incredulous amazement 'with which England
received the news that the “Cannibals”—they used to
give a preliminary haka in native mats—had belted
Hades out of three crack English counties, Surrey,
Northampton and Kent, in their first week in Eng-
land. The 1905 All Blacks flabbergasted Britain
anew, the years having wiped out the memory of the
Natives. The All Blacks, undoubtedly the greatest
Rugby combination the world has "seen, won 32
matches out of 33, losing against Wales by a hotiv
disputed try to nil. Scotland, Ireland, England and
France were easily beaten, and the point score was
868 to 47. Though Maoriland form is apparentlv
regaining pre-war standard, the 1924-25 All Blacks
will have a stiffer job than their predecessors, except
in Wales. All authorities agree that Welsh football
is not a patch on what it used to be.
ADVICE TO A PRINCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
‘lt is time the Prince of Wales took life more
seriously instead of hunting and steeplechasing oy
day and dancing by night. As long as he fills an
important position he should behave accordingly and
should not rashly endanger his life.” —London Labor
Herald.
Dash down the flowing bowl that cheers!
It also the digestion harms
And robs the nose adown the years
Of many of its pristine charms.
Down with the bowl! Its fatal lees
Cirrhosis of the liver brings,
And gout’s abiding agonies,
As Age draws near on Time’s grim wings.
lurn from the ladies! Turn aside!
Distrust the magic of their smiles.
Child, flapper, matron, gentle bride,
All are compact of tricks and wiles
Designed to ruin thoughtless Man.
luin from them, with a face of stone,
And as your days draw near their span
You will live happily alone.
Shun ev’ry risk ! If you must ride
Steer well-schooled hacks to quiet parks.
Eschew the open countryside
Where reckless Youth o’er hedges larks.
Be wary in whate’er you do
In love or liquor, sport or dance,
And England yet may boast of you
As one who never takes; a chance.
Moral Reflection.
Such is the sound advice of Age
Designed in ev’ry breast to waken
Respect for its conclusions sage.
Alas! that it should not be taken!
Alas! that princes, while they’re youthful,
Such splendid counsel should be cold to,
And state, in accents plainly truthful,
That they’ll take risks till they’re too old to.

THE INKY WAY.
“Jimmuck”: Only one dreadful thing happened
while the Fleet was at Fremantle. There was to be
an entertainment (with refreshments) aboard the
Hood; and a Perth paper, referring to the broad-
casting of invitations, said that “each guts most
bring the card issued for the function.” Probably
no “guest” was ever worse mangled.
“Aslimead”: Hobart’s new evening paper is to have
E. L. Burgoyne, chief sub-editor of the West Aus-
tralian for the last eight years and the “Elburg”
of dozens of Bulletin paragraphs, as its managing
editor. Burgoyne, whose father sat in the S. Aus.
Assembly for many years and until an advanced age,
is well known on the Inky Way of Adelaide and
Perth. The western city gave him an appreciative
send-off, along with a gold watch and a cheque,
Premier Mitchell being among those at the funs
Armand Jerome, who died recently and was buried
at South Head (Sydney), had a variegated career.
Many years ago he founded the magazine Cosmos,
which had a short life and landed him in trouble.
After a few years he reappeared in Sydney on the
commercial side of newspapers, and did well; then
lie speculated in real estate with more or less suc-
cess. His wife —she was Helen Bruton, a daughter
of a Sydney postal official —is well known on the
Inky Way and is at present doing journalistic work
in the U.S.A.
“Yoyang”: Australia opened its first newspaper on
March 5, 1803. Governor King, writing to Lord
Hobart in that year, said: “I gave permission to an
ingenious man who manages the Government printing
press to collect materials weekly, which, being in-
spected by an officer, are published in the form of a
newspaper weekly.” The “ingenious man” was
George Howe, a creole of St. Kitts, West Indies,
where he was born in 1769. His father and brother
were connected with the official press of St. Kitts,
and George had been on the staff of the London
Times before he came to Australia in 1800.
“Adelaide”: It is not often that the reading
of a death notice is received and reported with
“Loud Laughter,” but it happened at the luncheon
speechmaking when the Exchange Hotel in Hindley-
street, Adelaide, changed hands a few days ago.
Glover, mayor of the city, was describing the Ware
family’s tenure of the hotel for over half a century,
and quoted the way in which the Register referred
to the death of a leading citizen in 1914: “Last
December he met with an accident while crossing
the road on his way to lunch at the Exchange Hotel,
where he had been a regular attendant for more than
40 years, and this possibly hastened his death.”
“Iford”: What makes the Yanks abbreviate some
English words, or sets of words, and elongate others
I have always liked the cut-down sound of “back of
the house,” and “out the window,” and “two-three”
in place of our “two or three,” a comparatively
recent emendation, strikes me as commendable. But
in the most widely read of American magazines 1
encounter a sentence about children being “illy
nurtured and illy' prepared for a chance in life.” Why
tack a “y” on "to an adverb that has managed for
centuries without it ? And if “illy” why not
“welly”? Similarly, O. Henry uses “overly.” Cer-
tainly the dictionary suggests that “overly” is an
old English form which has perished in its own
country and survived in America —even as “gotten”
—but for a nation which prides itself on being in
a greater hurry than any other, the extra syllable
seems an inconsistency.
“P.X.”: J. H. R. Lewis, of Brisbane Telegraph,
had been 36 years with that paper; and he was on
the Courier for some time before he joined its
evening contemporary. He and James Edmond had
gone to Rockhampton at somewhere about the same
time to make the discovery that nature built them
for journalism. Lewis had had a job with the
Sydney firm which is now. Farmer’s • but even then
he played with ink, and his boss didn’t think that
ink and drapery mixed well. So he left. His first
real press job was in Northern N. S. Wales: he was
the office rouseabout for 20s. a week and his keep.
Then he went on to Rockhampton. James Edmond’s
venture in commerce was in confectionery in Maori-
land. If it had succeeded Heaven only knows what
scraps of wit and wisdom the world might have been
reading now on “conversation” lollies. As things
turned out, Edmond got a job as proof-reader; and
the confectionery trade lost him for ever. Lewis
was a tremendous worker who kept at it till the
en( j—he was still going furiously in his 70th year.
“Solomon Malaprop”: Dan Levy, N.S.W.’s sparse
Speaker, returned the other day from a little globe-
trot with the old moan about the lack of Australian
news in outside papers. I wish a dozen of these
sons of lamentation would consider themselves news-
paper correspondents for a time, and right through
this month of' March make up their condensed daily
budget of happenings for the world-press. Then I
wish they would ask themselves whether they would
read such a chronicle of baby beer if it was Cana-
dian or Brazilian news printed in .Melbourne or
Sydney. Australia can get space galore by specula-
ting in revolution, civil war, foreign war, nation'll
bankruptcy, high treason, brigandage, pestilence,
earthquake or the like. Other countries do —but
it isn’t worth while. And, on the other hand, it.
could get space by acts of high, wise, enterprising
and unusual statesmanship. The unusualness is a
sine qua non, and alas! the present lot of politicians
are dreadfully usual. The possible exception is
Theodore, and his finance gets a good deal of mention.
The information, for instance, that six fresh State
metropolises were in contemplation would make the
business world sit up. Everybody in the literate
classes would have to buy and learn a new map of
Australia, to say nothing of a history. Then peoble
would hear of Australia. They couldn’t help it. But
little can be done by cabling that we have “un-
limited natural resources,” even if we cable twice
a day.

The Repertory Society introduced Sydney
to John Drinkwater’s "Abraham Lincoln”
at the Conservatorium Hail on Saturday;
to-morrow and the succeeding night will see
the final performances of the play, or, rather,
series of scenes from the great patriot’s
career. From his early home life, to Wash-
ington, to the White House, to the packed
and racking days of the Civil War, down to
the grim tragedy in the theatre lounge, the
poet has followed Lincoln always feelingly
and often with arresting vividness. It is no
easy task to recapture on the stage the
atmosphere of such a period, the salient
characteristics of such a man, but the Reper-
tory Society has done it beyond expectation.
Much, perhaps most, of this is due to Gregan
McMahon, the producer; it is impossible not
to be impressed with the evidences of his un-
tiring care and unerring eye on everything
that touches the cast and presentation, and
the audience recognised his work generously.
Mr. Bryant gave a striking jiortrayal of Lin-
coln, the, tall, awkward, shambling figure
(so savagely caricatured in London Punch
of the ’sixties), and underneath it the rare
nobility of soul, the steadfast determination,
the glowing flame of patriotism, the intense-
ness, the simple piety. And there were
lighter touches, such as the President’s rich
enjoyment of Artemus Ward’s latest, and his
insistence that his colleagues should enjoy it
with him. Mrs. Cam Marina as the homely,
plain-spoken Mrs. Lincoln, Miss Ida Gough
as Mrs. Goliath Blow, Andrew Beresford
as Seward, Mr. Doyle as General Grant and
Gerald Carr as Booth were a few of the
more prominent characters in a capable and
numerous cast.
At Sydney Cri. “My Lady’s Dress” re-
turns to the wardrobe after to-morrow night.
“The Lie” succeeds, that most reprehensible
fiction whereby Lucy Shale robs sister Nell
of her lover amid the smothered sobs of
the gallery girls.
“Sybil,” at Sydney Majesty’s, continues
to deliver the glittering goods. The splendid
incoherence of the plot, the bravery of the
attire and the excellence of the singing all
claim and are awarded top marks.
AT MELBOURNE TIVOLI.
Renee Riano, the dancer whose legs arc
alleged to he insured for £20,000. Will
Hay, the schoolmaster comedian.
“Tons of Money” is packing Sydney Grand
Opera House nightly. Dorothy Brunton
witches and Charles Heslop drolls, the bogus
heirs amble in and get shot , out, the ballets
whirl and ravish, and the public pays.
Irene Vanbrugh and Dion Boucicault are
doing full justice to Pinero’s reputation and
their own in “The Second Mrs. Tanqueray,”
at Sydney Criterion. There is no room for
two opinions : about Miss Vanbrugh’s Paula;
it is finished acting, gripping and unforget-
table.
si: si: sj:
Sydney Tivoli clients seem a lot younger
since Bert Coote arrived. Playing “A Lamb
on Wall-street,” with Oswald Waller in the
wolfs clothing and Peggy Fishwicke as his
shepherdess, he is a true picture of a cane-
sucking Gussie. A continuous chuckle from the
audience trails after his brainless chatter,
and the general verdict is that he should be
asked in to stay. Hebrew monologuist
Julian Rose carries on, scoring too easily
with the crude substitution of a silly wrong
word for the right one.
“Main Street,” at Sydney Lyceum, gives
Sinclair Lewis's best-seller a rather bad
mauling. It excels in the minor character-
studies and the less important scenes, but it
will never have the grip of the book.
Fervid misogynists are frantic at being
taken in over “Woman Proof” at the
Globe. Thomas Meighan preserves an arctic
frigidity towards the ladies until near the
fade-out, when a fool will causes him to snap
up a fair one, and keep the dollars in the
family. “South Sea Love,” as seen at the
Empress, is manufactured on the Hollywood
sandhills, and merely cadses critics to won-
der why we don’t go to Botany to do Coral
Seas stuff. At Hoyt’s “The Rambling Kid”
is a casual cow-puncher pulling off the usual
woolly-west stunts.
JjS v *!» v
“The Taming of the Shrew,” now conclud-
ing Oscar Asche’s season at Melbourne
King’s, reminds old playgoers that they had
seen no broad comedy of such all-round merit
as Asche’s first production of “The Shrew”
in Australia. When in those long-ago days
the comedy was staged more elaborately, but
not more effectively, than it is now, the
managing man was remarkable for his easy,
hearty, masterful performance as the woman-
tamer. To-day he is the same Petruchio
grown even more humorous and realistic.
Physically and artistically he has spread
himself. It is the character in which the
flesh has been kind to him. His guttural
roar would tame a rhinoceros. From
being merely masterful he has become over-
whelming. Rut while his corporeal meas-
urements are bigger, his heart is also bigger.
In his brutal kindliness Petruchio is more
lovable, and his happy jollity in the memor-
able closing scene is infectious. With the
old irrelevant Induction omitted, and the
stage pictures framed in semi-circular
blackness, the show has almost a charm of
novelty in comparison with the original
Aschean production. Until Monday night
it should have Melbourne’s very best word.
Afterwards Geelong and Ballarat are to see
“Othello.”

Miss Doris Champion, a capable Katha-
rina, easily scowls and expresses bewilder-
ment at what she has struck in malekind,
but lacks the wondrous sweetness of her
predecessor in the part when hunger has
taught her to be gentle. Nor is Jessie
Page, as Bianca, quite the saccharine and
charming hypocrite she might be. Eardley
Turner, Greenaway, George Ide and John
Cosgrove (as the sham Vincentio) speak
their lines more Shakspeareanly than spry
and gallant Anew McMaster. George
Blunt (as Grumio), Landor and Mason
Wood are well placed, and Olive Proctor is
a widow for men to beware of.
“The Man in Dress Clothes,” at Mel-
bourne Palace, seemed born to bad luck
when the two imported ladies of the Sey-
mour Hicks co. fell sick and substitutes took
their places. The upsets brought their com-
pensations. as luck would have it. Miss
Ellaline Terriss lent personal interest to
the part of Germaine; and Beryl Bryant,
who appears to have taken over the part
from Mrs. Hicks, is turning her handsome
presence and distinctively appealing voice to
capital account. Tlie new girl brings new
color into the domestic misunderstanding of
Lucien and his Comtesse. Her awakening
to the fact that he has been an adoringly
magnanimous husband, as well as a futile
waster, is strikingly portrayed. In general,
the lively comedy has an air of being created
to supply Seymour Hicks with every sort of
smart repartee, droll predicament and
opportunity for brief emotionalism. He’s a
man of moods. Hicks of one and half a
dozen of the others. '.J
“Bluebeard’s Eighth Wife” is trading on
a sound business title and some pyjamas
at Melbourne Royal. But Miss Gertrude
Elliott is “nice,” or nothing. Her decorum
is cool as cucumbers, and white as new-
bled veal. Her manner is as exemplary
as her keen enunciation. She lives, moves
and breathes gently in an atmosphere of
falsity so thick that criticism could carve
it with a saw, if it were worth dissecting.
Like an old-fashioned woman’s letter
“The Cabaret Girl,” now at Melbourne
Majesty’s, says everything of importance in
its brief postscript, or third act. Frith, re-
gardless of his former pretence of being a
publisher, appears as a weird female at the
Cabaret, the burlesque vamp whom Frith
presents being about his best achievement in
eccentric comedy up to date.
* * * *
“Nellie Kelly,” at Melbourne Princess’s,
is still the gay-robed angel who reflects more
credit on Officer Kelly, her father, than he
seems to have earned in his police capacity.
The programme for the first week of
Melba’s grand opera season is announced.
“Bohfeme” (with Melba, on the open-
ing Saturday) ; “Lucia,” “Tosca,” more
“Bohbme,” Rigoletto” and “Butterfly” in
the following week, with repeats of “Lucia’
and “Tosca” on the Saturday—matinee and
evening. All the invading forces of song
will be disclosed in these five operas, the
casts including four prirna donnas in all.
The orchestra will be 54 strong. Prices are
to range from a guinea to ss. and 3s. in an
ordinary way, only the opening-night tariff
being extraordinary.
“ABRAHAM LINCOLN,” AT THE
CONSERV ATORIUM.
George Bryant as Lincoln, Vincent Doyle as
General Grant, and Andrew Bcresford
as General Lee.
At Melbourne Town Hall, on Saturday
night, Alberto Zelmau’s Symphony Orches-
tra had a grand review of the frayed and
the stereotyped, in which the inevitable
“Barcarolle,” the Cavallerian Intermezzo, a
selection of “Carmen” airs and “One Fine
Day,” from “Madame Butterfly,” had con-
spicuous positions. Other features were the
march from the second act of “Tannhiiuser”
and a bracket of Edward German’s dances
which brought every instrument into action;
but the most artistic success was scored in
Boccherini’s “Minuet in A Major,” which
made one visualise the wigged and powdered
phantoms of a politer age ceremoniously
prancing in the light of candles. The Over-
ture to Gounod’s “Mirella” was the only
other comparative stranger that was given
a hearing, and it was very gracefully handled.
The inclusion of Vieuxtemps’ Ballade and
Polonaise was designed to advertise the vio-
lin of Miss Bertha Jorgensen, and the damsel
knocked off the item as if it were an every-
night afEair. Also Mrs. Zelman made an-
other sensational debut in “Ah Fors e Lui,”
and was almost embarrassed by the applause.
The value of a Boy Scout training is re-
vealed by Hoot Gibson in “Blinky,” at
Hoyt’s, Melbourne, this week. Hoot is a
soldier on the Mexican border, and when his
adored is kidnapped he shows the Baden
Powell touch in tracking her down. “The
Age of Desire,” on the same programme,
demonstrates in some soppy passages a
widow’s yearning for her son after she has
deserted him to marry a millionaire. The
picture is almost as Penny Hornerish as the
Majestic’s tale of “The Poverty of Riches,”
in which an affluent but childless couple are
contrasted with the parents of a numerous
family. The Australian, Louise Lovely,
owns the hand that rocks the cradle in this
effusion. “Masters of Men,” which has also
found a temporary haven at the Majestic, is
a vigorous sea yarn in which Wanda Hawley
arouses the usual blind devotion with one
glance from her thrilling eyes. All the
nobility of character in “Little Johnny
Jones,” at the Britannia, is concentrated in
one horse and the lad who rides it, but there
is brecious little nobility or character in
“The Face at the Window.” which is pur-
suing its loony way at the Melba once more.
Fritz Hart again, by special request of
Dame Nellie, on Saturday night re-dislied up
the East Melbourne Corn’s rendering of
Purcell's three-act “Dido and iEneas” on the
stage of its former triumph, the Playhouse.
This critic could detect no particular differ-
ence in the newer rendering beyond an added
confidence on the part of the players, which
helped to lift the show all round. This
was especially noticeable in the Witches’
Dance, wherein the voice of Dulcie Cherry as
First Hag rang out with a ravishing full-
ness. The Con. songbirds warble sweetly,
if a trifle indistinctly at times. Rita Tay-
lor as iEneas showed more clarity of diction
than her sister players, and made a line
wooer to the beauteous Dido (Dora Warby),
who acted and sang with some distinction;
Marie Bremner had warmed up her part as
Belinda, and the chorus sang up splendidly
for the patroness. A classical dance by
Dorothy Gladstone’s pupils was pleasing but
lifeless, whereas the orchestra, led by vio-
liniste Gertrude Healey, left nothing'to be
desired.
Allan Wilkie, at the Prince of Wales,
finds that Adelaide has good finan-
cial support for the Bard. He jumps from
Mercutio’s lightness to the melodrama of
Richard 111., and seems to enjoy it all.
Nellie Bramley has been taking a rest by
playing the one-line part of the Indian girl
in “The Squaw Man. This old play seems
a sure draw for revival, with its Ouida-like
story of the self-sacrificing English aristo-
crat. But the marvel of it is that the
Bad Man can threaten everyone with instant
death at the revolver’s point, while the
moment he himself is shot all the majesty of
American law rushes to avenge him. Guy
Hastings and Fitzherbert take small part's
also, leaving the lead to Hewlett, w r ho makes
it frank melodrama.
Miss L. Lucas among the exiles:—
To an Australian in London the people who went
.to see the Exhibition at Burlington House were as
interesting as the pictures and certainly more enter-
taining. First, last and all the time they clamored
for Lindsay, Lindsay, Lindsay. How impressionaDle
is human nature! Very few had any idea what the
Lindsays meant (I hadn’t myself), but they had
“seen about them in the papers.” It was “Let’s
come and see Lindsay’s first!” And “Huh!” (a
fat, sensual old gentleman disappointedly to his eye-
glassed dame), “I don’t see anything in them to
make such a - fuss about!” One enormous woman
wearing a trailing skirt, a feathered hat and a
savage expression, and grasping a stout stick in one
hand and a lorgnette in the other, strode about
snorting. It made one wish that some of die
nymphs and ladies would come out of their frames
and dance round her. The beautiful siren picture,
“Unknown Seas,” was, however, generally admired.
“It’s just flaying!” said one dainty English Miss to
another. “But, Ay don’t think Ay quayte layke the
lady over there with the yellow face and the green
jumper!” Her friend rejoined that girls all got
“that color” in Australia. Then an exiled Austra-
lian, proudly doing the honors, brought a frieni
along and remarked on a “typically Australian land-
scape”-—a Heysen. But one was sorry not to see
more of Walter Withers’s work. It catches the
atmosphere so absolutely. It must, for it makes an
Aussie feel homesick for that little track under the
messmates that the poddies scamper up at feeding-
time. Some of the Streeton landscapes brought a
pang to the heart. One has to say “heart,” though
in reality homesick pangs never do catch the heart—
they come much lower. One tiny glimpse of wattle
that Penleigh Boyd had sent over was greedily
scanned by many an envious eye. And one lingered
long on a pastel, “The Model,” by Cumbrae Stewart,
and a charming if conventional etching of light and
shadow through the pillars of the G.P.O. at Adelaide,
by J. O. Goodehall. It was interesting to notice
the peculiarly Australian type of face in the por-
traits —the frank, clear-cut beauty so well exemplified
in Leason’s “Study of a Girl in a Blue Velvet
Frock,” with her bobbed hair, her clear eyes and
independent air. Tne eyes of a new country looked
“IRIS,” AT MELBOURNE KING’S.

and tears the place up by the roots.
fearlessly, inquiringly into the eyes of the delicate-
featured, more subtle faces of England. They do
not always understand one another, but at heart
there is little difference between them. The fine
study of Melba had just that element of pioneering
blood in it, with the face showing ideals not crushed
by attained ambition; humor; bitterness and cour-
age. It drew all eyes. This and another —Lionel
Lindsay’s head of Henry Lawson —many an Austra-
lian paused to pay homage to. And then, just at
closing time, two young men rushed in and inquired
breathlessly of the attendant, “Where are the
Lindsays ?”

The FACE POWDER
de LuxE.
“0.K.” : A lot of ill-feeling regarding the
importation of Italian choristers for the
Melba season might have been spared the
public—apart from the Theatrical Union —-
if the position had been fully explained in
the first instance. The statement that the
25 choristers are stock understudies, as well
as highly-educated choristers, with “at least
60 operas” on the tips of their tongues,
seems sufficient justification for their engage-
ment in Italy. If a company of European
artists in grand opera is accepted as essen-
tial to a season up to Melba standard,
surely the importation of practised under-
studies is permissible. The management
has some rights in this matter. A very
costly company ought to be efficiently double-
banked, and the simple, even the only, way
of safeguarding the repertoire was to im-
port a score of second strings.
“A.P.”: The J. C. Williamson firm, in
answer to requests for some Wagnerian
examples in the forthcoming opera season,
rushed into print with the dictum that operas,
to be properly given, must be rendered in
their original language. But Wagner operas
were sung in English by Perceval Allen,
Agnes Nicliolls, Edna Thornton, John
Coates, Robert Parker and Hinckley, mem-
bers of the Quinlan co., and no one can truth-
fully assert that the treatment was inade-
quate and unconvincing. London news-
papers testify to the success of Australian
artists like Florence Austral, Clara Serena,
Fred Collier and Horace Stevens in these
music-dramas, and I haven’t noted any
objection to their having employed transla-
tions. If there is anything in the J.C.W.
contention, Florence, Clara, Fred and
Horace should have taken their talents to
Germany and sung Wagner’s music in the
language of that country, confining the use
of their mother tongue to “Maritana” and
“The Lily of Killarney.”
“Norbell”: It is announced that Her
Majesty’s, Melbourne, is to be called His
Maj.’s “out of compliment to Dame Nellie” ;
but why this change of sex should be a
compliment to the diva is too subtle for
me to guess. As the Alexandra, Her Maj.’s
was opened in 1886 with an alleged farcial
comedy called “Bad Lads.” For years after
that the old barn saw many near-managers,
and many a ghost declined to walk. Dan
Barry made a do of it, and perpetrated “The
Kelly Gang” and similar atrocities there.
Alfred Dampier had long and successful
seasons, alternating “Marvellous Melbourne”
with “Merchant of Venice,” and taking simi-
lar odd jumps from the sublime to the pre-
posterous. Simonsen pluckily tried grand
opera there. But the “Alec” was mostly
a freezing-chamber which gave cold feet to
hot-headed but ambitious managers until
J. C. Williamson took it over after his
split with Musgrove and called it “Her
Majesty’s.” and it has been the Firm’s Mel-
bourne stronghold ever since. Bill Cos-
grove it was who first called it Her Majesty’s
—that was for one brief and whirling sea-
son long ago.
“Spot”: Thus far Seymour Hicks lias
had an extraordinary run of bad luck, and
some allowance may be made for its effect on
the temper. Still he should curb his inclina-
tion to hector those who feed him during
his dialogues in “The Man in Dress Clothes.”
Sometimes his petulant asides can be heard
all over the house. The writer, sitting in
the fourth row of the dress-circle, heard him
exclaim “For God’s sake go on!” to a
young girl who was playing a difficult part
for the first time —a part she had had thrust
upon her at the last moment. Australian
VICE-REGAL ARTISTS.
THE G.-G. (to Manager Tallis ): “Now that you have placed Lady Patricia, my friend
Lord Stradbroke and I were thinking of an — haw — engagement, Sir George."
TALLIS: “What do you suggest?”
THE G.-G.: “Well, front of the house staff, perhaps? Not acting parts. You see, we’ve
had them ever since we've been in the Country, and we’re looking for a change.”
artists do not like that sort of thing, and
Australian audiences are quick to notice it.
During rehearsals no one could have been
more charming than Hicks. It is only when
the play is actually in progress that he
seems to lose patience.
“Gnarek”: Though Seymour Hicks gave
years of his life to musical comedy, some of
his finest work has been done in parts such
as Edmund Kean in the play of that name
and David Garrick in “Garrick.” I wish
the Ward management would induce him to
present a programme of his one-act sketches.
His Scrooge is great.
“O’South”: These theatrical companies
are getting too hot. Not only do they charge
good silver for programmes in which the
reading matter is nearly all puffs for actors
and actorines employed at their other
theatres, but they’ve taken to advertising
“attractions” from the stage, and trying to
pass it off as part of the show. The music-
shop featured in the first act of “The
Cabaret Girl,” now at Melb. Majesty’s, is
adorned with a poster announcing that O.
Asche is playing in “Iris,” at the King’s.
There is no connection between “Iris” and
“The Cabaret Girl,” except that both are run
by the Firm. Someone should take Somebody
aside and whisper politely that there is such
a thing as good taste, even in advertising.
“Mid-Channel”: With “Iris” running in
Melbourne, and “The Second Mrs. Tan-
queray” in Sydney, Pinero is in the boom
again hereabouts. “The Second Mrs. Tanq.”
has become in modern drama what “Ham-
let” has been in Shakspearean productions.
Every actor in a position to gratify his whim
has a try at “Hamlet,” and every actress
similarly circumstanced goes for Paula Tan-
querav. A fact known to few is that Pinero
had Arthur Sullivan as a collaborator in
“The Beauty Stone,” Comyns Carr supplying
the lyrics. Pinero's libretto is not in print,
but Sullivan put some of his best work into
the music. The song in the third act of
Pinero’s “The Profligate” was composed by
Sullivan.
“Royee Rolls” : “Iris" may be artificial and
old-fashioned, but the producer does his best
to bring it up to date. Thus Maldonado, at
Melbourne King’s, makes his first dramatic
exit to join a taxi, which announces its
presence by two toots off stage. Also, the
guests at Iris’s dinner-party empty a tray of
cocktails in the first act. But these incongru-
ities are trifles compared with the lavish
modern dressing of the leading lady. Iris is
just as much entitled to be adorned accord-
ing to her period as Miss Juliet Capulet is
compelled to appear in the prevailing mode
of three or four hundred years back. This
principle is recognised by Pinero himself,
who was recently responsible for a London
revival of “Sweet Lavender,” wherein all the
ladies were garbed in the singular bustles of
that period.
“Simplon” : It is a pity that Oscar Asche
didn’t revive the Induction with his latest
version of “The Shrew” at Melbourne
King’s, for here was a unique chance to
make a virtue of his frank obesity in the
part of Christopher Sly. So far as .my
memory serves me, Asche is the only actor
who has staged the Induction in Australia in
recent years. Wilkie omitted it, possibly
because he couldn’t see himself as the tinker,
and Henry Ivolker also cut it out when pic-
turesquely taming Margaret Anglin. There
was one feature of Ivolker’s production
which I’m sure was never attempted before.
Miles Clifton, a gussie comedian who had
been seen in musical shows, was hired to
play Gremio, and went about imitating
Petruchio with a little top whip.
“Abbot P.”: It was Carlyle Smythe who
engaged Marian Burton for the second Syd-
ney season of Sir Charles and Lady Halle,
and I question Bernard Halle’s statement
(B. 28/2/’24) that the venture was a finan-
cial frost. The Melbourne season certainly
failed, but handsome Marian had no part in
that. Eleven concerts were given to full
houses in the Centenary Hall, and the artis-
tic honors were divided by the great violin-
ist and the gifted ballad singer. That’s
where the trouble mentioned by “Topee”
(B. 7/2/’24) came in. The situation grew
so strained that Miss Burton did not accom-
pany the party to South Aus. The Adelaide
concerts, too, were ill-supported.
t 4 S.T.S. ’: “P. Pol.'s” old-time sequel to
"Ixie Taming of the Shrew’' (B. 6/3/’24)
can be matched with St. John Ervine’s new
book, ‘ lhe Lady of Belmont.” It shows
Portia and Nerissa as matronly figures Id
years after the Trial. Antonio being presented
as an elderly bore whose one yarn about liis
pound nobody will listen to. The old
lawyer Salario has never forgiven Portia
tor stealing his big chance. (His letter
commending her to the duke was a forgery
of her own making!) When he at last
meets Shylock he refers to the past: "A
most interesting case, but shockingly handled
from your point of view. If you had en-
gaged me to plead your case, 1 think Antonio
here would be considerably lighter than he
is. A pound of flesh! After all, it isn't
much.” All this is very like Bernard Shaw.
But, later, Shylock—who never had any
idea that Portia was not a man—drops in
to her country house in the thick of an
intrigue between Bassanio and Jessica, and
saves his daughter by an opportune appear-
ance when someone else is expected, just as
Lady Windermere was saved by her mother
in Oscar Wilde’s play.
“R. 8.”; “M. P. Greenwood Adams,” as
the American papers name "Storky,” is mak-
ing good in the States with his moving-
picture lecture about Nor’-West Australia. lie
started the feature as an educational lecture
to New York schools, and is now rushed with
regular engagements because the grown-ups
like his story, as all ages like a panto-
mime. _ Mrs. Adams (Irma Caron) has
been singing in New York, and is to sing
again when young “Storky” is old enough
to be left at nights.
“Spotlight” : Every deadbeat in Melbourne
is envying the characters in the second act
of “The Man in Dress Clothes,” who nightly
dine on “real hors-d’oeuvres, soup, lish, meats
and wine” (see popular reports). The poor
devils certainly do cat: —they’ve got to—but
their Lucullian spread is mostly slices of
cake. And the wine is some temperance de-
coction which tastes like mouthwash.
"To P.” : A new Town Hall is coming
into being at Stawell (Vic.), and at a recent
council meeting the local bumbles accepted
the offer of the Combined Pictures Associa-
tion to donate £lOOO to the building fund.
In another letter the Association asked for
the sole right to show pictures in the hall
for five years at £5 a night. Smell anything?
“Nelbur” : German film manufacturers are
making a bid for a share of the screen space
occupied by the 3 per cent, of the pictures
screened in Australia which are not of
American origin. A Berlin co. is busy with
its circulars in the local market, and.
although prices are not mentioned, sufficient
indication is given that the flicks will be
cheap enough.
“Paree”: A new moving-picture story is
written by no less a person than Clemenceau.
It partly reflects his experience of the
amazing cheerfulness of soldiers blinded in
the war, but the base of it is a very old
Chinese story showing how it is better some-
times to be blind. The hero gets back his
sight, but finds things so unpleasantly differ-
ent from his fancies that he deliberately
forfeits it again. The Chinese Imperial
Theatre players, happening to be in France,
have done the adapting for the screen, and
the acting.
“Orb” : “Caesar’s Ghost’s” actor who had
his “bit” fastened to the scenery as poor
dumb mouths to prompt him (B. 13/3/’24)
is an old acquaintance. Hamlets have had
their lines pinned to the backs of the tomb-
stones at Ophelia’s funeral before to-day.
I knew one actor-manager who got chunks of
his part done in large letters by a sign writer,
and displayed along the footlights, just out
of sight of the audience. And once I Sven-
galied to a Trilby who had the most ticklish
hurdles written in indelible pencil all over
her beautifully laundered hands. Unluckily
the heat of the moment, or the warmth of
Little Billie’s love-making, dissolved the
handwriting. Her key speeches were washed
away and her hands w r ere soon a purple
blur; and so was her language, afterwards.
The only safe way is to learn the stuff
properly—or take on honest work.
“Bello”: Concerning theatrical critics, it
is said that a dramatic author, who was
reading a masterpiece before the committee
of the Comedie Franchise, was disturbed to
notice that one of the members, Monsieur
Got, had fallen asleep. The author stopped
reading. “How can I get an honest opinion
of my play,” he demanded, “when one of
you gentlemen is fast asleep?” M. Got
rubbed his eyes. “Monsieur forgets.” he
remarked, “that falling asleep is also an
opinion.”
“Nella” : As “Binks” says (B. 6/3/’24), the
stage convention which suddenly stifles a
roomful of conversation to enable the lead-
ing man to get a talky piece off his chest is
startling at times. I wish it could be applied
to garrulous nuisances who infest the re-
served stalls. They will babble, even when
Little Eva is on her way to Heaven, and
to the people on the stage it is simply mad-
dening.
THE LURE.
(In Eight Heels.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Pursuing still a secret quest,
I watch film-mothers, quaintly drest,
Stage-settings scrub or die on,
Say comic things like‘ Sakes !” and “Lor’!”
And wear an ample bosom for
The heroine to cry on.
i'faybej there is an ancient lout
To moralise, and in and out
The hero's mansion toddle,
To serve the letters on a dish,
And turn his eyes up like a fish
And shake his hoary noddle.
The villain! Oh, with wicked eyes
And lips on which you see the lies
And reputation shady,
He slouches in a moral fog,
The sort of wretch who’d kick a dog
Or contradict a lady.
With sundry imitation men
He gathers in a cardboard den
To counterfeit misdoing;
Vile joy ms horrid soul elates,
And felony he alternates
With fierce and useless wooing.
The star, of course, is simply sweet;
All flapperdom is at her feet.
Her lips;! Her smile! Her dresses l
An angel she who, rouged and curled.
Sweeps sin, and sorrow from the world
With her abundant tresses.
She only loves the splendid youth
Who cleans his mils and tells the t ruth
And always speaks politely;
His hair is smooth, his teeth are white,
His wardrobe is the knuts’ delight,
He couldn’t look unsightly.
What wrongs these noble souls endure
Because they are too good and pure
For this degraded planet !
When by emotion they are sawn
I’m riven by an awful yawn—
Confound whoe’er began it!
No sympathy my bosom fills.
A careful course of movie thrills
Has made me tough as Nero;
But still this hope entices me:
Some happy night I hope to see
The villain rise in rebel glee
And smash the noble hero.

War Gratuity Redemption
and Conversion Loan
TO DIGGERS
WHO STILL HOLD THEIR
GRATUITY BONDS.
It will help the Commonwealth
considerably if you can see your
way clear to convert your bonds
into the New Loan.
The very attractive rate of interest
offered (6% free of State Income
Tax) provides you with an invest-
ment that will take a lot of beating.
The cash will be waiting for you on
May 31 if you want it, but the
Treasury’s conversion proposition is
well worth your consideration.
A GOLDEN
OPPORTUNITY
that might never
come again
TO CITIZENS WHO CASHED
GRATUITY BONDS FOR
THE SOLDIERS.
Many of you cashed these bonds
at the time at considerable inconve-
nience to yourselves. To all of you
who helped the Diggers in this way,
the Commonwealth Government
confidently appeals to convert your
holdings into the New Loan.
The Government on their part
are offering an interest rate (6%
free of State Income Tax) which
should help you to come to a quick
decision to help them in connection
with their Loan Conversion opera-
tions.

TO ALL MEN, WOMEN AND
CHILDREN WHO HAVE A
LITTLE CASH TO SPARE.
Honestly, can you imagine any
safer investment than a Common-
wealth Bond? It is the one security
that transcends all others. The in-
terest is paid every half-year just as
surely as the sun rises and sets.
Just think! You are offered 6%,
free of State Income Tax, and you
have the choice of taking up 3-year
bonds, 5-year bonds, or 10-year
bonds—whichever you like.

Free of State Income Tax.

TO PARENTS
WHO WOULD LIKE TO PUT
ASIDE A NEST-EGG FOR
THEIR CHILDREN.
Here is a golden opportunity—
one that might never come again.
By taking up a ten-year £lO bond
and letting the interest accumulate,
it would be worth £l7/1/9 on
maturity. If ten years is too long,
try either a five-year or a three-year
bond. The 5-year bond would grow
into £l3/4/1 1, and the 3-year bond
into £ll/17/8.
This is absolutely the best thing
you could possibly do for your
children.

Cutting the Cost
of Cultivation.
ONE of the most vital problems facing the farmer is how to keep
down cultivation costs* Agriculture cannot be improved, the
lot of our farming communities cannot be made more pros-
perous if the cost of cultivation is excessive. Old methods
must give place to modern implements, machinery and labor saving
equipment. The power tractor is destined to play an important
part in the work of reducing the cost of cultivation. By making the
farm technically efficient the way will be open for better farming and
increased profits*
Kerosene farm & General Purpose Tractor
The CASE Tractor is pre-eminent for its durability, efficiency and
adaptability. Because of sturdy construction and mechanical
superiority it will last 50 per cent, longer than the average farm
tractor. Within its power-range there is no farm job draw-bar or
belt for which this tractor is not well adapted. Ample power for
deep plowing and more intensive working of the land, increased
farming operations, reduction in labour costs and a great saving of
time —these are highly practical results which accrue from the intelli-
gent use of a CASE Tractor*
Every farmer who is anxious to make farming more profitable should
investigate the merits of the CASE. Maximum efficiency is assured
by reason of CASE Service* Spare parts are available at all Branches ♦

" Carrawatha,”
Wongarbon, N.S.W.
I worked the 15/27 Case Tractor on top gear
over all sorts of surface conditions, hitched to
io-furrow Sundercut, doing the hardest of the
ground, and was never stuck for reserve power.
I also hitched the Tractor to two io-furrow
Sundercuts and ploughed for three days on low
gear. She handled this load with ease in undula-
ting country, ploughing 4 inches deep. In 23
days the Tractor ploughed 380 acres at a cost of
i/8j per acre for fuel used, including benzine,
oil and kerosene.
The Tractor displaced three eight-horse teams,
representing a saving in fuel versus chaff of £5B,
and about £2O in wages. The Tractor gave no
trouble —it was a pleasure to handle. Undoubtedly
the best thing on wheels. Wishing you every
success.
Yours sincerely,
(Signed) W. J. CAMPBELL.
Pinnaroo,
26th August, 1922.
The 15/27 Case Tractor does the whole of the
work on my farm. I have disposed of my horses.
I recently ploughed 100 acres, the Case Tractor
pulling 8-furrow plough doing the work in six
days. Would have taken two men and two io _
horse teams to accomplish the work in the same
time. The fuel consumption is exceptionally
low, being six pints per acfe ploughing, and
barely two pints of oil per day. The above
includes some very heavy sandhills. Allow me
to compliment the Company on your service.
Wishing you every success with the Case Tractor,
as I am well satisfied.
(Signed) R. EIFLIM.
Lower Light,
24th August, 1922.
The 15/27 h.p. Case Kerosene Tractor has given
me great satisfaction. Pulled 12-furrow Smith
Twin Plough on top speed, fallowed on 5* pints
per acre. Harrowed fallow land on 2 pints per
acre. Worked 12 ft. Combine Drill, and culti-
vated 400 acres in twelve days. I have done
completely away with horses on my farm.

Grandmamma died in great agony.
Susan’s papa was exceedingly vexed,
Gazed coldly at Susan, and murmured “What next?”
. ...S.R.H.: Neither is attractive... .Roy T.: Com-

W.s.s.: The verse is lumpy and the ideas as thin

has been done to death.... Mid-C.: Those alphabetical
rhymes are the invention of the Devil.... Billaby:

ends on a rotten rhyme Will V.: “My Rival” is
too slight.... Bay W.: Spoiled in the telling....

worn phrases as that... .L.E.P.: We don’t reprint;

Rambling futility, apparently written with the
broken end of a match.... Augusta: The transla-
tion does not impress us C.M. (East Brisbane):

ton) : No, thanks.... F.T.M.: “Poor Feller’.’ must

well enough put Pelagos: Too rugged and rav-
elled Latham A.: Not enough in it. .. .M.H.H.:
Little color, and the interest is thin.... Muriel D.:
Do you think you would have found the autumn
trees “stripped bare” in Australia if you had not
wanted a rhyme for “hair”? A.E.C.: No, no.
Don’t try the sonnet until you are master of the
simpler forms Nombak: The thing is too vivid
to miss:—
The old tom cat
Sat on the mat;
He started to purr,
And scratched his fur
From fleas.
Ha ! What’s hissing ?
Indeed, what’s swishing
As through the door ?
A snake ! Good Lor’ !
He sees.
One spring, and a flop
On the snake he did drop,
And he sheathed his ivory teeth
In the skin and beneath,
To the blood.
A slither, and a twdst,
And the snake just missed.
Then he struck, and bit
And the cat threw a fit
With a thud.
. ...E.E. (Paddington): It isn’t strong enough....
Eileen M.: The triolets are not bad; but try some
other form... .C.E.T.: Doesn't make much of a
yarn. ... Senojo: Not up. ... Kongroo: It falls down
pretty hard....W.R.T.: Misses... .L.L.: Merely
chopped-up prose.... Rita J.: Both miss, but not
by a mile. .. .E.S. (Toowoomba): Those nouns must
have their articles unless there is some better reason
for dropping them than the easy making of a line.
. ...R.F.C.: Pretty crude.... The Whip: It doesn’t
move us J.F.8. : No interest whatever. .. .DiP.J.:
You make it very dreary.. . .E.M.E. “Paper” fails.
. ...R.8.T.: The same old thing almost in the same
old words.... Richard H.: The yarn is bright in spots.
See if you can’t make it a bit more convincing....
L. ; Nothing there. .. .Callidore: Topical verse
must have more point than that ". . . .~A.Y. (Prejffb'n):
Horrible. . . .Caesar’s Ghost': None of them up to the
mark. .. .M.H.H.: Not the goods for this barrow. ...
Otiola: Strained verse that wanders off into the
wilderness.... Arthur B.: Doesn’t get near the tar-
get. .. . J.G.8.: Weak and wobbly... .Demo: No
yarn there. . . .A.C. (Tocumwal) : The verse is mostly
about nothing. .. .C.H.M.: Unpleasant yarn that works
itself into a muddle.... Ripponlea: All right; sing
of your violent triumph:—
Despite this discouraging ridicule and dissent,
1 see my future course;
I’ll keep my nose to the grindstone,
Till I eliminate the flaws ;
I’ll persist in my industrious system,
Till I burst into your pages by force.
For my Patience is Herculean,
My determination stern;
I’ve the hide of a crustacean ;
And my enthusiasm is e’en

Insects are
Unpleasant
Company—
ĥ
they are not particular
whether they tease the
cat, torment the baby, or
bite father.
Insects are not fussy about their
habits or their place of abode.
They revel in filth, and, for the
good of mankind, such dissemi-
nators of disease should be
mercilessly destroyed; and the
easiest and surest way is by the
use of
Kruses
Insecticide
The beauty about this remarkable
destructor of noxious insects is
that it is quite harmless to poultry
and domestic pets, but with Fleas,
Flies, Ants, Bugs, Cockroaches,
Mosquitoes, Moths, etc., one puff
means sudden death.
One tin of the genuine Kruse’s
Insecticide, intelligently used, will
keep a house free from Insects

minator of insect pests obtainable.

“Sanley”: For 30 years the Dubbo-
Werris Creek railway connection was agi-
tated for in vain. Then the Federal autho-
rities took a hand, and decreed its construc-
tion for national defence purposes. A few
months ago the line was opened for goods
traffic, with the result that it broke down
with the burden placed upon it. The con-
nection permits of a short cut from Bris-
bane to Melbourne, leaving out Sydney;
hence the appalling delay in building it.
* * * *
“Hunter” : Considering the business, £575
seems a high price for a seat on the Adelaide
Stock Exchange. Yet that figure was paid
the other day, and another seat brought
£550. Melbourne seats are worth about
£500; if they fetch more the members are
apt to be told not to talk about it. Both
in Melbourne and Adelaide complaints are
heard that there are too many brokers
dividing up the business; the extinction of
20 per cent, of the seats as they become
vacant would render competition less fierce
for the survivors.
“Sturt”: The United Methodies in Adel-
aide have decided that the “manse” adjoin-
ing the church in Pirie-street (just behind
the Town Hall) is too valuable a site to
be used that way. For years the old par-
sonage has been let as a school. Now a six-
storey building is to go up. All the agencies
of the Methodist body will have their head-
quarters there, and a large revenue is
expected from letting the rest of the offices.
The synagogue in Bundle-street had a simi-
lar brain-wave long ago, but it parted with
the freehold of its frontages—and is sorry
now, local values having gone up enor-
mously.
* » * *
“Pibroch”: There is no obvious connec-
tion between the bagpipes and our dingoes,
except that both make an awfully melan-
choly noise; but dingo-skip is an excellent
material for making the bag of the pipes,
and I know one or two pipers -who swear by
it. The dingo, like the dog, does not sweat
through his skin, and therefore has no pores
in it. Consequently there is no chance of
a leakage of the air from the bag. So here
is a chance to develop the dingo-skin busi-
ness. There is no shortage of the raw
material. Dingoes seem to be increasing
not only west of the Darling and in other
inland districts, but in such coastal areas
as East Gippsland (Vic.) and the Cape
Howe country (N.S.W.).
* * * *
“Adamascus”: Bananaland has lately
seen some big station sales. The Fairbairn
Pastoral Co. has disposed of Peak Downs
and Magenta stations, including 90,000
acres of freehold and 47,000 sheep, to James
Clark, Peter Tait and Charles McLean.
Clark and Tait already own Barcaldine
Downs, Bimerah and Northampton;
McLean, formerly manager of South Comon-
gin, sold Langton station last year. E. G.
Blume has purchased Caldervale, near
Tambo, which consists of 430 sq. miles of
mulga and brigalow well supplied with bores
and natural water. He already owns Dun-
robin, with 8500 head, and Forester, with
8500 head, both near Aramac, together with
Bexley and Yanburra, near Longreach, with
40,000 sheep, and Oakleigh Park, near
Bowenville, with 12,000 sheep. He also
owns the Woodlands (N.S.W.), carrying
000 brood mares, with Piastre among its
stallions.
* * * *
“F. Clinton”: The Sydney tramway sys-
tem dates back to 1861, when a short line
was iaid from the Quay to the old Central
Railway Station. Local prejudice was
against it, and not being much of a conveni-
ence it was swept out of existence after
about five years. Twice subsequently the
idea was again taken up, but not until 1879
was a new line laid. This connected the
old railway station with Hu-nter-street. Pro-
gress thereafter was steady. The first roll-
ing stock —four steam engines and six cars
—were imported from America. Steam was
the motive power until about 30 years ago,
when electricity began to supersede it,
although it was some time before the old
steam motors finally disappeared. Originally
the North Shore line (opened 1886) and the
King-street line (opened eight years later)
were worked by cable traction on account of
the grades. The remains of a couple of the
old cable-cars are still to be seen on the cliffis
at Tamarama Bay, near Bondi, where they
serve as summer-houses.
THE BOS’N’S VIEW.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’ve ’ad a run o’ heavy gales as bad as I have seen;
Tne giant combers come aboard and buried us in
green.
I mind the time when one big wave fair stopped the
hooker dead;
She shook herself —then bounded on. The Leeuwin
light’s ahead!
From Rio town to Sydney town’s a devil of a run;
We have to make ten thousand mile afore the trip
is done.
’Twas south o’ Cape Agulhas, whore she labored like
a cow,
We struck the roarin’ forties. Now the Lecuwin’s
on the bow.
The Old Man is a cracker-on —a shark for speed is he.
The mate’s a Nova Scotiaman —he’s .fought like hell
with me.
And I’m the hooker’s bos’n. Did yer hear that sea-
gull’s scream?
That means the Bight’s a-calling us. The Leeuwin’s
on the beam.
But when we get to Sydney Town I’ll take me old
discharge
And sign aboard a steamboat, for I’ve finished with
this barge.
Nigh forty years a salt-horse man, but never more
I’ll yearn
For sails and cordage—steam for me. The Leeuwin
light’s astern.
Fes, old Cape Stiff ’as took one ear—a falling spar
me knee ;
The scurvy got me good and hard, w r ay back .n
. ’eighty-three.
That blooming mate put in the boot —he thought
he’d won the fight
Till I put in the marlin-spike. The Leeuwin’s oui
of sight.

WHETHER you own 500 or 50,000 sheep you will find a
Lister plant exactly suited to your needs and your
pocket. What is more, you know when you get a Lister
that you are getting longer life and lower upkeep costs than any
other plant could give you. Listers not only need fewer repairs
an other machines, but the repairs or renewals that do crop up
atter years of service are small, inexpensive affairs that can often
be done by the expert on the spot.
You II find, too, that shearing progresses without a hitch when
Listers are on the board. Shearers are pleased with the smooth
drive of the Lister—whether it’s overhead gear or the portable
plant bracket—and they know that Lister handpieces give them
e best chance of going right through without a stop for adjustment
by the expert.
In every way, therefore, the Lister means money saved—to
say nothing of time and temper. Let us detail your installation
right away.

Professor of Organic Chemistry at Sydnej
Uni., filling a niche vacated since June last,
when Prof. Read went to a Scottish var

“Veedee II.”: Amongst other things sal-
vaged from the wreck of the \Vairaiap. ,
which has been at the bottom ot tlm CMat
Barrier (M.L.) since 1894, was a bottle o
lager. Despite its age it was \oted excel
lent. The “head” on it suggested that it
gathered strength with the years ot deep-
sea storage. A bottle of champagne was
also recovered, but a defective cork had rui
tiered that undrinkable.
C. R. Hodge, Registrar of Adelaide ’Var-
sity for 32 years, has resigned, alter a
complimentary “long leave.” He joined up
40 years back—the ’Varsity is only 4b years
old—as the solitary clerk of Tyas, then
Registrar. Fuller, laboratory assistant in
those days and now a lecturer, is the only
one left of the few then on the staff. The
new Registrar is F. W. Lardley, accountant
to the Uni. since 1900, and Assistant-Regis-
trar for the past 12 years.
“Robot”: Castlereagh-street, Sydney, once
the home of the livery stable, lias been com-
pletely motorised. Tattersall s, McMahons,
the Arcadia and Inglis’s are memories of
the past, and the last stronghold of the horse
struck its flag the other week when 1 otties ,
whose object in life was the repair of poor
Dobbin, cleared out to make way tor a
garage. With its departure the horse has
given his final neigh, and the honk of the
motor-liorn is now the street s anthem.
“The Wombat” : Copy of an order received
by our local tailor: —
Dear Sir,—l am writing to ask you to make a
suit of black serge for my husband by 20th inst.,
as he wants to wear it to my daughters wedding.
I would like one about £5 10s. As I am anting
this in a hurry I have not had time to call him
from the paddock to get his measurements, but
he is 44 round the top of his trousers and they
are 43in. long. In case this might not be enough
to go by, he is about the same size as a Mr.
you made a suit for.
South Aus. continues to be a State that
makes things as well as growing them. 4he
gross output for the year to last June
figures just issued by the Government fetatist
was 27 millions sterling, being over to-
per head of the half million or so ot popula-
tion. The number, employed is 04,00 U, an
increase of 8003 since the war ended, and
wages have m the same period gone up to
£179, a rise of £47. The figures leave out of
account, a host of small factories employing
fewer than four people.
“Fana”: During the early days of the
military occupation of former German New
Guinea there was a firmly-rooted idea that
all Government property belonged to him
who could get away with it first. Conse-
quently there were some heroic teats ot loot-
ing performed, the list of missing articles
including—incredible as it may aeem a
lighthouse. It was a brand-new one, and
had been placed in position some distance
from Rabaul, just before hostilities broke
out. A patrolling destroyer was the first
to report its disappearance; it turned out
to have been dismantled and removed with
the aid of an auxiliary schooner.
“Herodot”: The out-back drinker of a
couple of generations back liked something
he could feel going down. In 18b3 the
Bourke (N.S.W.) police took proceedings
against a publican whose Shearers’ Rest
was about 20 miles out on a charge ot sell-
ing adulterated liquor. An excise chemist
who had examined samples of the stuff de-
posed that it contained copper sulphate or
Milestone, saltpetre, soap, tobacco and
several other substances. In his defence the
publican pleaded that his customers would
not drink stuff if he supplied it to them
unfortified, and called various witnesses who
declared that they had been drinking m Ins
bar for some years and had never had occa-
sion to find fault with the liquor. The fine
inflicted was only £2, which suggests that
the Bench knew that kind of throat.
“Nanangoat” : The Red Cross Society may
have ceased to function where “Ex-Dig.'
(B. 28/2/’24) has his towri, but the Cru-
saders’ sign still flies at Rosemount Hos-
pital, Brisbane. Every day members visit
the wards and leave fruit, and on I inlays
tobacco, cigarettes and matches are handed
out, and damaged Diggers who are short ot
any little toilet necessaries can count on
having their wants repaired; also delicacies,
provided through the society’s agency, form
a welcome addition to the fare furnished by
the Repat. To the present writer, coming
into dock for overhaul and repair after an
absence of five and a half years, the most
noticeable change in military hospitals is
the marked absence of those insufferable sc-it-
advertisers who once mopped up so much
limelight. The people who still carry on are
quiet-mannered but very effective, in marked
contrast to the windbags and gushers who
loomed so large in the old days.
“Wart”: Austin Wilson (who married a
clever Hobart girl, Evelyn Ansell, M.A.) is
in Australia on- behalf of the London and
North-Eastern Railway; he is pressing the
claims of Hull for a bigger share of Aus-
tralian produce. Covent Garden (London)
he considers one of the most antiquated and
expensive markets in the world; yet the
greater part of Australia’s fruit, even when
intended for consumption in Bristol, Bir-
mingham. Manchester and Leeds, passes
through it. Australian butter contains less
moisture than Danish; practically all of it
goes to London, where it is bought by
blenders, who add moisture and sell it under
another name. The wholesale price averages
from £lO to £l5 per ton less than Danish.
After treatment it is sold retail at the same
price as Danish. Wilson recommends an
association, something on the lines of
“Bawra,” to retain control of butter and
fruit, and send the cargoes to the best mar-
kets.

A Soldier and
a Writer
About 1730, when the
famous Captain John
Crichton, late of the
“ Greys,” was over 80
years of age, he was
often seen on the arm
of Dean Swift. It was
ne who persuaded this
worthy old soldier to
write his most interesting
memoirs, which were
published in 1731*
THE Cigarette which bears the name of the famous
"GREYS” regiment has made, and sustains, a
reputation among cigarettes that is second to
none for wholesomeness, purity and fragrance. It is
par excellence the comforting cigarette.

“I iise only Kexona Soap and And
It both soothing- and healing, in fact
an ideal Skin Soap.”
Miss EDEE SINNOXTE,
29 Frances Street,
Hyde Hark.
Rexona Soap
Girls!
Why Not Enjoy
a Good Complexion?
You cannot if you do not care for
the delicate skin of the face. When
you wash your face, do you realise
that it is not enough to simply re-
move the dirt, but that your skin
needs a soothing, healing influence
to keep your complexion fresh and
free from blemish? Scented toilet
soaps are often very pleasant, but
do not assert this influence, as you
are well aware. Many of them con-
tain free alkali, which tends to dry
up the skin and destroy its deli-
cate texture.
Even the better class of such
soaps do not in any way help
to improve the skin, but Rexona
Skin and Facial Soap is not
only an absolutely pure soap,
but is medicated on the
same principle as the
famous Rexona Ointment,
which is famous thro ghout all of Austral-
asia as the Rapid Healer. That is why
Rexona Soap really does for the skin and
face what cosmetics are supposed to do, bv
ensuring not only a clean face, but a pure
and healthy skin, and thus gives you
a clear complexion.

Enchanted.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
gods of old, who never die,
Around and all about me come,
And live again as they have lived
In golden-grove Elysium.
On every height, o’er weald and wold,
I hear immortal strains of old.
I hear immortal gusts of air,
Where scented winds blow high and free,
For shining forms, lialf-God, half-man,
Companion me from tree to tree.
I see Parnassus meet the skies,
W atching with these enchanted eyes.
Thither I dare not take you too.
I go my long green way alone
To hear, when all the boughs are filled
And music in the reeds is blown,
No wind-wove chorus, but the ripe,
Full sound of a Sicilian pipe.
And. ever in the middle Spring,
When buttercups have come and gone,
And myrtles mirrored in the stream
Are clear as those of Helicon,
The cuckoo’s song in sad refrain
Awakes some old forgotten strain.
Tis no strayed bird that lifts its soul,
But Orpheus with his windy lute
Piping the. world again from sleep,
Where it has lain dream-drowned and
mute—•
Thin music wild with ecstasy
That echoes back to Thessaly!
Out in the tangled black-plumed woods,
By dripping glen and watercourse,
Dark shapes crash through the underbrush.
I hear the snuffle of a horse;
And, ho, the maddened centaurs ride
Once more adown the mountain side!
I see their foam-bespattered flanks,
In leafy lane and piney pass,
Their smoking hoofs that paw the ground
Treading upon the thick-starred grass;
And old Silenus in the sun
Shaking his garlands one by one.
I watch the wild-haired Maenads break
Apart the twinkling forest buds,
The fauns beside the river flags
Dancing along the lilied floods;
Ah, though you tried you could not hear
Pan piping loud into my ear!
Down where the pools are glistening green
The Nereids loose their long black hair;
The cool sea-currents play across
Their quivering limbs pearl-white and fair.
Fean over. You will see naught save
The brown weeds shaken by a wave.
Bind me unto this haunted earth!
I am content with this alone.
I think perhaps that I have learned
Secrets the joyous gods have known,
Hearing, the shepherds pipe divine
Old Doric songs to P’roserpine!

MYRA MORRIS.
Captain Goliath.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
U TI M Y dear Macquarie,” said Mrs. Mac-
Jjj. quarie to the Governor, as they
strolled in the short summer twi-
light through the grounds of Government
House, down towards Benelong’s Point,
watching the flaming crimson and orange
that succeeded a remarkably fine sunset over
the western reaches of Port Jackson —“my
dear Lachlan, the man is a perfect hear.
Yes, indeed, that is what he is. A hear.
Why in the name of goodness has he come
to join the 73rd? Oh, do look at the color
of the harbor! Isn’t it splendid ? Have
you ever seen anything like it?”
His Excellency paused and a little smile
flickered across his tanned and ragged
countenance as he turned it towards the
pretty lady at his side. There was never
any more doubt about Elizabeth Macquarie’s
prettiness than there was about her being
a lady. Both were amongst the most obvious
facts of Sydney in 1812. Neither in the old
Government House that stood where Bridge
and Phillip streets intersect to-day, nor in
the one that has been where it is these 80
years past, has there ever lived a sweeter
•ady than Mrs. Macquarie.
“Entrancing, my love, entrancing! Truly
magnificent! Perhaps in India, and maybe
jn Ceylon, or Egypt, I have seen as fine.
-Not often, my love—not often. But pray
inform me—l was pondering another matter,
a little business I had this afternoon with
Hr. Greenway, the architect. Pray, of whom
w ere you speaking?”
.“My dear Macquarie! For quite two
minutes—if not three—l have been discuss-
es the appearance, character and manner
m the latest acquisition to your regiment.
j* nt * you have not listened to me! You
have been dreaming, sir—dreaming of some
new structure which you and that unhappy
Hr. Greenway—the poor man, I feel so sorry
tor him—are going to put up here, or at
i.arramatta, or at the Ilawkesbury. Put-
tln§ bricks and mortar before your lawful
wedded wife! Macquarie, I vow’ you should
nave been an architect yourself. ’Twoulcf
nave become you vastly better than vour
present office. ’Twould, indeed !”
The Governor smiled again. His wife wsc
one of the few people in the colony 8 wlm
saw the grim matures relax into kindlv ex-
tbatT ? th l f lf P ’ , canny Scot s humor
that lay beneath the stern outlines of that
strong mans face. He laughed aloud as
he looked down at her, the red afterglow
behind him making his scarlet jacket "still
more scarlet against the sombre green of
the shrubberies on the hillside.
Oh, come now, my dear wife,” he said
qwzzingly, “do I do so badly as Governor?
Rut an architect! Yes, I flatter myself T
mt U , \r haV r< made a very to lerable archi-
tect. Mr. Greenway says so. Or, at any-
rate, he says that I know good work when
I see it. That is something, now, is it not?"
“You and Mr. Francis Howard Green-
way, my good Macquarie! Of course the
poor fellow says so. What else should lie
say to—-ah—-a splendid title, dear Lachlan
7 —the Captain-General, et cetera, et cetera,
in and over his Majesty’s territory of New
South Wales? If you must know it, I was
discussing Captain Mitchell.”
“What, Big Geordie! Well, what of him,
pray?”
“An uncouth man, a clumsy giant, a bear,
my dear man—a bear. Do you know what I
have christened him?”
“And what is that? His name is George
Macdougal Mitchell. Of good family. One
of the Mitchells of Ardcraig. A Low-lander,
but a worthy man. And a good soldier. I
consider that the 42nd's loss has been our
gain, by reason of his having exchanged into
the 73rd. An estimable character. A strict
disciplinarian. But just. The men of his
company like him. So, I understand, did
those of the detachment he brought; out in
the Marquis of Lorne. And when an officer's
liked by his men—in spite of his insistence
upon a high standard of efficiency—well, I
am proud to have such an officer in the 73rd.
Proud and pleased. Pray, what is vour
objection to him, Elizabeth?”
Mrs. Macquarie smiled and shook her
head. “Oh, really, I cannot say that I
object to him, Macquarie. But the man is
so grim—so serious—so solemn—so silent.
So awkward in company. And so huge. I
have named him ‘Captain Goliath.’ What
an immense man he is! And his hands
are so large—and red. And lie upsets chairs.
And, well, perhaps he is ugly. And dour.
A great red bear. A great, solemn bear,
with nothing to say. ‘Yes, ma’am,’ ‘No,
Mistress. Macquarie’-—’twas all I could get
out of him when he came to dine last week.
Pray, has he some trouble, do you know-?
He looks to me as though some sad thing
troubled him.”
Macquarie’s face became grave, and he
nodded his head and sighed.
“Well, then —in strictest confidence, my
love —Big Geordie has his troubles. Very
great. troubles. you must say nothing
of it if I tell you. You promise. I have it?”
“Of course, Lachlan. I think you know
you may trust me, don’t you?”
“Indeed I do. This is his tale. Ten
years ago in London, when on leave—lie was,
of course, a subaltern then—he fell in love
with a Mrs. Charlotte Entwhistle, a notori-
ous woman of gaiety, who was not—well,
not a good woman as—as you are, Mrs. Mac-
quarie. . Handsome, dashing, fashionable,
but vicious. However, let us turn back to
the house. It grows dark, and I fear the
air is a little chill for that muslin of yours.
Come.”
“Yes, yes. Macquarie. Pray continue.”
Her curiosity was aroused, and as he
tucked her little arm beneath his elbow, she
looked at him wonderingly. The best of
women find interest in such matters as the
unfortunate affair of Captain Mitchell. Her
husband went on in his dry, precise fashion.
Well, Mitchell married her. A mistake
—a very grave mistake. It seems she drank,
and did worse. She was—ah—unfaithful.
Promiscuously. No better than a doxy.
Degradation after degradation. Such women
exist, you know—far out of the ken of such
as you. my love, thank God ! Scandal upon
scandal. Finally Mitchell had to put her
away—make her an allowance—a most
liberal one he made, I believe—on condition
that they lived apart, and she came not near
the regiment. But she did. No faith, no
honor, no decency. At last, in despair, he
exchanged with Mackarness—you remember
him—who was at the depot in Perth, and
was to bring a draft out here. So he came
to us three months ago. And now wdiat
think you’s happened?”
Oh, poor Goliath !” Mrs. Macquarie was
instant sympathy. “What misfortune ! Never
shall I call him a bear again. The wretched
woman ! But what fresh disaster has come
upon him?”
“Yesterday the barque Prince Regent
came into harbor. Female convicts. One
hundred and twenty of them. One who has
a sentence of 14 years for forgery—indeed,
at her trial she was cast for death, but -was
reprieved—she”——
“Yes, yes, Macquarie?”
“She is Charlotte Mitchell! He knows
she’s here.”
Mrs Macquarie was genuinely distressed.
No tale of sorrow or affliction ever passed
that good woman unheeded. So soon as she
had been told of Captain Mitchell’s hideous
tragedy her mental attitude towards him
had changed from one of laughing raillery
at his. awkward solemnity and shyness into
a feeling that, however she was to do it, it
was necessary for her in some way to com-
* r j P rotect the big, unhappy soldier.
And although, after the fashion of women,
she. would be savagely infuriated with an
erring sister, none the less had she some
vague feeling that there was something also
that must be done for his profligate and
abandoned wife. She must not be allowed
to drift from bad to indescribably bad. as
it was possible for a woman to drift in New
South Wales. There might be something in
her that would be worth saving.
Mr. Secretary Campbell, top-hat and cloak
in hand, awaited them on the verandah.
“Ah,” said the Governor, “are you going
out, Campbell?”
. “If you please, your Excellency—that is,
if your Excellency doesna require my sair-
vices this evening. A small party at young
Mr. Pilkington’s, over on the Rocks.”
“La. my dear John,” laughed Mrs. Mac-
quarie—he was her cousin—“surely you are
not going to join that triumvirate of rascals,
Messieurs Calder, Wicks and Pilkington, in
some of their mad villainies! They will lead
you astray.”
“Na, na, Eleezabeth. Just a bowl of
punch and a pipe of tobacco wi’ the lads in
company wi’ Dr. Hastings. I am past such
doings as ordinarily divert yon callants. A
quiet, respectable evening. Neither the
doctor nor myself will succumb to their
rogueries. Your Excellency.”
“Yes, Mr. Campbell?”

“ Every Picture
Tells a Story'
Tells on the Kidneys
Many People have found this to be true.
The strain of overwork tells on weakened
kidneys. The hurry and worry of business men,
the heavy lifting and stooping of workmen, the
women’s household cares tend to wear, weaken
and injure the kidneys until they can no longer
filter the poison from the blood, and the whole
body suffers from the waste matter that
accumulates. Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are
prepared especially for weakened kidneys; tired,
worn-out backs, have proven their merit in
thousands of cases. Convincing proof of their
worth is here told.
SYDNEY MAN TELLS HIS STORY.
A COMPLETE RECOVERY.
Mr. M. Dowling, 25 Rosebery Street, Rozelle, Sydney,
says:—“For about three years I suffered a good deal
with my kidneys, and during that time was treated by
doctors and tried different remedies, but nothing did me
any good. My back used to ache fearfully, and it was as
much as I could do to stand up straight after bending
over for a little while. I had liniments rubbed in, but
the relief was only temporary, the pain being soon as
bad as ever. The kidney secretions were very much
disordered, being highly colored and scanty. My general
health was far from good, and I often used to feel so ill
I could hardly attend to my work. One day I saw an
advertisement for Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and the
thought occurred to me to try this remedy. I bought a
bottle, and in a few weeks I began to feel better. As I
went on w r ith the treatment the improvement was main-
tained, and by the time I had used four bottles was cured,
all sign of backache and kidney trouble having entirely
gone. I am in splendid health now% and have only Doan’s
Backache Kidney Pills to thank for my wonderful
recovery.”

DOAN'S
Backache Kidney Pills.
DOAN’S OINTMENT CURES PILES.
SYDNEY PEOPLE SAY SO.
Mr. .Tames Higgins, Queen Street,
Beacousfield, Sydney, says : —“Some
years ago I suffered a lot from Itching
Piles, the irritation being very trying,
particularly so at night, and during the
hot weather. A friend advised me to
use Doan's Ointment, and knowing how
good Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
were, I got a pot at once, and it proved
a blessing. After a few applications I
got relief, and as I continued with the
treatment, the improvement was main-
tained until finally the Piles completely
disappeared. Five years have elapsed
since I used Doan’s Ointment, and I
have had no return of the ailment all
that time. I cannot speak too highly
of this remedy, and recommend it to
other sufferers.”
Six years later Mr. Higgins says :—•
“I am still free of the torture of Piles,
and have been since Doan’s Ointment
cured me eleven years ago.”
Mr. James Rees, 44 Lower Campbell
Street; Surry Hills, Sydney, says -
“Ten years ago Doan’s Ointment cured
me of a very bad attack of Itching
Piles, and I have been free of that
distressing complaint ever since. Be-
fore I got this Ointment I tried several
remedies, but none of them gave me so
much as relief from my suffering. The
pain and irritation I had to endure
were awful, and at times I felt I could
nearly tear myself to pieces. I heard
Piles, so bought some, using it with very
of Doan’s Ointment being good for
pleasing results. The first few applica-
tions relieved the irritation a good deal,
and before I had finished one pot I was
quite cured. I always keep Doan’s Oint-
ment in the house and use it occasion-
ally just as a preventive against any
return of the complaint.”

MIGHTY FINE REMEDY.
at tlie Coal River. I have his formal accept-
ance of the office in writing.”
“Ah, good. I am glad of it. He is the
very man for Newcastle. Well, a pleasant
evening, Campbell. Don't let me detain you.
Good night.”
“How good of you to think of that, my
dear Lachlan!” murmured Mrs. Macquarie
as they entered the house. .
“Well, well, ’twill give the poor fellow a
chance to get a little way from his trouble,”
said Macquarie. “Time to breathe.”
For the continuance of this story that
adept young confidence man —well known in
the neighborhood of Covent Garden, Long-
acre, Piccadilly and the Strand —Mr. James
Hardy Vaux (to whose instructive “Me-
moirs” the reader is referred for full bio-
graphical details of a career as villainous
as it is entertaining) must be held account-
able. Always preferring the exercise of
brain to muscle, Mr. Vaux, during the second
period of his several exiles in New South
Wales, had, by means of a polished address,
a good education, much cunning, and the
fact that he wrote a hand of copperplate,
obtained for himself a clerical position in
the office of the Superintendent of Convicts,
Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson. To him one mid- >
day, some six months subsequent to the ap-
pointment of Captain George Macdougal
Mitchell as Commandant at Newcastle, came
his immediate superior, Mr. Abraham
Smellie, Chief Clerk, with a letter in his
hand.
“Here you, Vaux,” said Mr. Smellie, “this
is a letter from Overseer Tomkins, at th’
Coal River, approved by th’ Commandant,
for twenty women prisoners to be sent up
there for th’ good o’ tli’ soldiers an’ th’ rest
o’ them. Tomkins says ’e don’t want sich
a hold lot as went along last time. Quite
nasty abart it, ’e is—an’ ’im bein’ a fav’rite
o’ Jonathan’s, we’ll ’ave for to obleege ’im.
So look up th’ last list o’ th’ women avail-
able at th’ Factory at Parramatta, an’ pick
out a score o’ th’ nooest arrivals, an’ see
they’re under forty an’ ’ave got long sen-
tences. Gawd d—n his eyes, Tomkins seems
for to think ’e’s at tli’ Coal River for to
enjoy ’imself, as it might be in Se’en Diles.
Nothing but young ’uns good enough for ’is
Turksliip! Ho, I’d pamper ’im, 1
would ! An’ them Scotch sojers, too.
’Owever, there it is. Make out a list, and
write a letter to th’ ’super at Parramatta,
an’ Jonathan’ll sign it w’en I come back.
I’m a-goin’ out for dinner.”
Quite fortuitously Mr. Vaux headed the
list of ladies destined to add to the popula-
tion of the Lower Hunter with the follow-
ing entry:
Mitchell, Charlotte, Prince Regent, /.)
Years, Middlesex Sessions, Forgery .”
*■ * * *
Twenty years after his time there were
many great, tall lads, native-born, inhabiting
the valley of the Hunter River between Wal-
lis Plains and the pass across the Liverpool
Range above Murrurundi, but none of them
were taller or finer physical specimens of
manhood than Captain George Macdougal
Mitchell, Commandant of Newcastle and its
district in 1812. In all the colony, during
the brief period of his life in New South
Wales, there was no greater man than he,
in stature or in strength. Well might Mrs.
Macquarie have nicknamed him “Captain
Goliath.” He was a Goliath and an Anak
and a Hercules —if it be possible to imagine
those big fellows as comparable with a quiet,
serious, gentle, melancholy giant who did his
duty with almost painful exactitude.
Whilst sitting before the fire one morning
after breakfast —it was a tempestuous day
in midwinter —smoking a pipe, and reading
a London Morning Post that was six
months old, his butler, a polished old “lifer”
who had been a clergyman, came to the door
and made an announcement.
“Excuse me, sir.”
Captain Mitchell lifted his eyes from his
paper. He had a strong, ugly face that had
a look of steadfast seriousness in it, and
something of brooding melancholy—the
vague and indefinable suggestion of secret
trouble which Mrs. Macquarie had noticed.
He had blue eyes and sandy hair, a thick
neck and immensely broad shoulders, whose
great muscles were strikingly evident through
the scarlet cloth of his tightly-fitting uniform
jacket. He laid the paper on bis knees,
and turned his head towards the door.
“What is it, Har-rdy?” His accent was
very Scotch.
“If you please, sir, there’s a man on the
verandah who has just come across from the
signal-station. He says that the Govern-
ment schooner is a little way to the south’ard
of the Coal Island, with her foretopmast
gone, and evidently in distress. She is fly-
ing the Jack upside down, he says, and mak-
ing heavy weather of it, sir. ’Tis feared
she may not be able to get round the
island, sir, and the gale’s blowing so hard
'tis likely she’ll come ashore. The Harbor-
master, Mr. Evans, sent him to inform your
honor of his predicament.”
Dropping the paper to the floor, the Com-
mandant rose to his feet, a startled look in
his eyes.
“By the Lor-rd, is that so. Hardy ! My
boots and cloak, quickly. I must hurry
down. Gr-reat Heavens, she’s got a batch
of woman prisoners aboard! The Pelican
brought word yesterday that they were to
come by the next Government vessel. Is
the messenger cer-rtain ’tis the Henrietta?”
“Positive, sir. She’s so close in, lie says,
there can be no mistake.”
“Hurry-—my boots! Tell the man to wait
for me. I’ll no’ be a meenit.”
Presently, with the Harbormaster’s mes-
senger trotting behind him, like a little boy
trying to keep up with his hurrying father.
Captain Mitchell was striding rapidly over
the soaked grass towards Collier’s Point,
where Fort Scratchley crowns the hill to-
day, through a fierce south-easterly gale and
driving sheets of rain that brought the hori-
zon almost to the Coal Island (Nobbys)
itself. The roar of the breaking seas on
the wide pavement of rock, and against the
base of the cliffs further south, was constant
and unvaried. What was visible of the sea
wds a white expanse of boiling, seething
waters. And on their edge the little Gov-
ernment schooner, partly dismantled, and
with only her lower jib set, was driving
in towards the shallow gap between the iso-
lated rock and the mainland, where, in the
next decade, Maior Morrissett began to build
the first of the Port Hunter breakwaters.
Down at the point he found Mr. Stewart,
the lieutenant in charge of the detachment
of Highland Light Infantry that formed
the garrison of the little settlement, Mr.
Evans, the Harbormaster, the Deputy Assist-
ant Commissary, Mr. Snodgrass, three or
four overseers, and, behind them, a little
crowd of male and female convicts and sol-
diers, gathered together on this vantage-
ground to witness what almost inevitably
promised to be the most tragic shipwreck
that had happened there during the port s
short history. . .
When the huge Commandant arrived
amongst them they took on the aspect or
pygmies. His six-foot-seven of vast man-
hood made them look like children. He
sought out the Harbormaster, and, cupping
his hands, bent nearly double to yell in his
“Can we no’ do something for them, Mr.
Evans V” - , , , , ,
The little stout sailor —he had been boat-
swain of H.M.S. Porpoise in Governor Bligh s
time—shook his head. He turned his face
upwards, and yelled toward his zenith:
“They’re as good as gone, sir. There s
nothing can be did—saving to be handy along
the shore, an’ try for to pick one or two or
’em out o’ the breakers, so be as they lives
to be washed ashore. See —there goes th jib.
She’ll strike in five minutes. Gawd elp cm
all! Was th" noo lot o’ wimmen for to come
from Sydney in her, sir?”
Captain Mitchell nodded—then pointed
down to the edge of the roaring, crashing,
milk-wliite seas. He yelled his orders. Ilis
immense voice came from his towering
height like a trumpet call.
“On to the rocks, all of ye. Save whom
ye can.” .
Down the leeside of the hill the gathering
trailed slowly through the dashing rain after
the Commandant and Harbormaster, and pre-
sently the whole population of the Coal River
penal colony was ranged along the shore,
anxiously watching the doomed schooner,
whose people could be seen on the deck, cling-
ing to shrouds and rigging, as she drove,
pitching and heaving, to the tumbling line of
breakers on the landward side of the Coal
Island. The rags of her torn sails streamed
from her spars. As the Harbormaster’s mes-
senger had said, her foretopmast was gone.
Right aft was a huddled group of people who
looked like women.
“Ali-h, she’s into it!" screamed Mr. Evans.
A huge following sea half pooped her, and,
when she lifted, the figures that might have
been women were scattered along the deck.
Two small black specks were tossing shore-
ward through the broken white turmoil of
the waters. Presently but one of them was
visible.
Another great wave tilted the schooner s
stern high in the air, and surged beneath
her. The watchers held their breaths, ex-
pecting to see her strike, and meet with
instant destruction. But a miracle hap-
pened. Clean over the shallows the mountain
of water carried her, and, her luck sticking to
her, she was presently blown over the bar at
the river’s mouth, and dropped an anchor
inside the entrance.
“By Gawd, wonders ’ll never finish !” yelled
Mr. Evans, turning to the Commandant, who
had been watching this thrilling escape at his
side. He gaped with sudden astonishment.
“Holy saints! What are ye about, sir?”
He saw Captain Mitchell throw away his
cloak, and then tear off his red jacket. Bare-
headed he was pointing into the breakers. He
howled to the Harbormaster:
“One of the women! I’ll get her.”
“Hell! Don’t try it, y’r honor. ’Tis
death to go in there.”
But the giant was already hip deep in the
lathered spume. They saw him dive through
the first high, curling crest that came thun-
dering on top of him, and then for ten
minutes beheld his mighty struggles as he
battled outward to the woman in the boil
beyond. At last they saw him reach her.
And then a most astonishing thing. As she
clung to him the watchers ashore were be-
wildered when, feeling his footing momen-
tarily, they beheld him suddenly raise his
clenched fist and strike her full in the face.
She disappeared.
“A neculiar coincidence,” chronicles Mr.
Howe in the Sydney Gazette of July 25,
1812, “noted by our correspondent at the
Coal Harbor, in connection with the recent
lamented drowning of Captain Mitchell, Com-
mandant at that Settlement, whilst attempt-
ing the rescue of one of the female prisoners
washed overboard from the Colonial schooner
Henrietta, was observed when the bodies came
ashore. The unfortunate creature for whom
he most gallantly and, alas, vainly gave his
life, was recognised as a woman named Char-
lotte Mitchell, per Prince Regent. Nothing
is known of her antecedents, but ’tis con-
sidered strange that she should have borne
the same name as that of the gallant officer
who so dauntlessly went to her rescue.”
The Governor shook his head, and Mrs.
Macquarie cried, when they read Mr. Howe’s
paragraph.
