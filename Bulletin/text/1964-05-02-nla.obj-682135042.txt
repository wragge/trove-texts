Lucas automotive lamps for every purpose. 6 and 12 volts.
That instrument you see perched up on the front seat of a Lucas test car is one of our
employees —in a way. Without time for tea breaks, it puts in long hours, along winding
roads, answering “dazzling” questions for Lucas lighting engineers.
Lucas was the first auto electrical company to employ a cine camera for this purpose.
To get important data on dangerous dazzle. To make changes, if necessary, in the beams
thrown by future headlamps. To find beams best suited to our road conditions, Lucas
put that “eye specialist” up there to work for you. Take advantage of "his” findings at
your local Lucas agent. Lucas Electrical Equipment. . . distributed throughout Australia.

are sacked; they are not put “in process
of being cut down to size”. Prof. Legge’s
very phrase implies semi-independence.
Can he not see that?
Prof. Legge refuses the “appeasement
label”. Naturally 1 accept his refusal un-
reservedly. The fact remains that in his
letter (7/3/64), to which I was reply-
ing, he wrote: “Does he (Dr Knopfel-
macher) really advocate any policy
towards Indonesia other than one in
which vigilance is combined with a
determination to keep open the door to
negotiation and misunderstanding.”
There is no mention of our commitment
to Malaysia. I can understand his
acerbity at this point; but for him to
ask me if I wish bombs dropped on
Djakarta is just damned silly.
I admit I was imprecise in describing
President Soekarno merely as a warlord.
Though he appears to mismanage the
affairs of the country according to
eclectic methods that were a feature of
warlords proper (may they rest in peace
under their now exclusive title), he is
obviously also a charismatic leader of
huge demagogic skills, synthetic ideology,
expansionist ambitions, and racialist cast
of mind. He is what liberals like Prof.
Legge would have described in less con-
fusing days as a fascist.
Prof. Legge throughout makes much
of the “changes” since 1958 (or 1960
different letters, different dates). But
as late as 27/1/62 Messrs Herbert Feith
and James Mackie wrote in a fortnightly
as follows: “But high and middle-rank-
ing officers of the three services are in a
position to force major political changes
. . . The powerful territorial command-
ers of the Army have their jobs to
lose in a military effort which goes
wrong . . . With the Army so heavily
and profitably enmeshed in the govern-
ment . . . Any sort of action which
can issue in war means a threat to
established positions of many kinds.”
This argues a pretty odd set-up. The
problem is not that of terminology but
of power political realities.

Sir,
Would Alexander Marentek (4/4/64)
explain how his high-titled and named
nominees became “outstanding military
commanders’’ in Indonesia?
“Outstanding” is understandable,
because there is no comparative standard
or yardstick ... a mongol can be
outstanding among ordinary children . . .
but why “military”? I am unaware of
any outstanding military operations by
Indonesia, and I am puzzled that it can
have so many outstanding personnel in
its military hierarchy.

PORNOGRAPHY
Sir,
Mr Rylah’s to my mind laudable
efforts to enforce the law against porno-
graphy have met with such well-mar-
shalled opposition in your columns, with
space even found for hints of improper!
motives - 1 recall the word “smut-
hounds” that I feel it is up to those
normally quiet people who side with,
him to become vocal. I myself believe)
in the suppression of obscenity in all
its forms, with sufficient severity to do
the job. I am unmoved by the argument
(so often heard but usually so insincere)|
that the evil of suppression is worse
than the evil suppressed, because I dt
not think (nor do I believe does an;
other responsible person) that suppres
sion of obscenity is any more an inter-
ference with liberty than suppression o:J
burglary. I also believe and this is
my point that I hold these views prin-|
cipally because I am a family man, and ;
if this is so it follows that Mr Rylat '
can surely count on at least tacit sup
port from a very large class dare
say the very best class? of Australians
whose views ex hypothesi are similar to
my own.
But tacit support is not good enough!
in the face of growing and influential
pressures from what are general!;
regarded as high places against Mi
Rylah and what he stands for. Althougl
since the Orr case there must be man;
a man-in-the-street not so sure as before
that professors or even church leadei
are always right on moral subjects, then
will be still a great number who are
and who will, for example, be awed inti
silence by the impressive names in th
Freedom to Read group, which eve;
includes (heaven help us) a bishop
Such people need the encouragement c
persons of standing showing up fearlessl;
on the other side whenever and wherever’,
the opportunity occurs, and I hope this
will be forthcoming.

“BIG BILL” IN RED CHINA
Sir,
Those of us who make substantial
contributions to the wool levy fundi

read your article on “ 'Big Bill’ Gum
and his visit to Red China” (21/3/641
One is left with the impression that the
recent expedition to Peking was designee
not only to promote the sale of wooi
in Red China, but also to promote Sir
William Gunn’s entry into Federal
politics.
What has been the reaction M
Peking and Australia to Sir Willing
Gunn’s visit? At the Australian end
efficient public relations men had ban-
ner headlines in all the metropolitan
dailies. But at the Peking end, if there
was any publicity, I have been unable to
discover it. There must have been p re j
cious little. In Peking's publicity an
news, Clarence O'Shea’s visit to China
was rated as of greater importance; 1
was the Communist trade union leader
and not Sir William who got I* l
headlines. ,
The effect of Sir William Gunn's tour
days in China was negligible at
Peking end. But in the rash of headim

at the Australian end the effect was
decidedly political. Apart from assisting
Sir William's hypothetical entry into
Federal politics, which after all is rela-
tively unimportant, the Peking expedi-
tion must help to forge closer economic
links between Australia and Red China;
it therefore assists those political forces
working for recognition of Red China and
her admission into the United Nations,
and helps the attack on American econo-
mic and political policies towards Red
China.
The overall effect of these is either
to weaken our alliance with the United
States or to weaken American policies
in East Asia. Either of these alterna-
tives would be disastrous for Australia.

“THE FATS OF LIFE”
Sir,
The plug you gave Marrickville
Holdings in National Notebook (4/4/64)
only serves to spotlight the fact that the
material used for advertising, e.g., Dr.
H. M. Whyte's book “The Fats of Life”,
on present-day knowledge appears to
be old hat. Scientists in Germany and
America said recently that, after involved
research, they had found that milk was
one of the greatest substances available
for good health and the prevention of
disease. The German scientists say that
at the beginning of their work they saw
causative connections between animal fat
consumption and atheroscelerotic chole-
sterol deposits. This theory, however, is
now a thing of the past. The German
health magazine “Du and Die Welt,” the
official organ of the West German
Medical Association, stated: “We must
confess that we were about to commit a
miscarriage of justice”.
Another German research worker,
Professor Aebi of Berne, Switzerland,
said: “From the point of view of nutri-
tional physiology a complete switch to
vegetable fats cannot be recommended.
Animal fats not only contain fats which
the body needs, but also other protective
substances essential for the human
organism.”

THE DFRB SCHEME
Sir,
It is regrettable that “Serviceman”
(11/4/64) claims to speak for so many
servicemen when he states that he is
perfectly happy with the DFRB Scheme.
I would have thought that any intelligent
serviceman with 27 years’ service behind
him would be painfully aware of the
major anomalies. Rather than recount
these anomalies I can only refer him to
articles in The Bulletin (22/2/64 and
21/3/64), together with the various
letters to the Editor, which I am sure
reflect the attitude of servicemen gene-
rally to an iniquitous scheme.
When the Minister for Air, Mr D. E.
Fairbairn, described the DFRB Scheme
to members of the House of Represej
tatives one could be excused for thin
ing he was describing a wonderful, nei
lottery. The way “Serviceman” describe
the scheme it sounds even better; A
haps one should gently tell him
such things as compound interest ai
Commonwealth contributions. Jr
While I don't claim to know as mu •
serving members as the warrant olficd 1011
may I add that ,of all the warrant ofsir-'
cers I know, I have not heard one s [heaj
a good word for the scheme. In coßjti 1
elusion I will make one more remark-
does “Serviceman’s” satisfaction »j.
conditions of service stem from the[r vei
that to him the Armed Forces is.r. d
haven and that he could never hope! j
better himself in industry? “!

Overseas Service
An Sydney last week, bound for Brisbane
• after a 24-hour reconnoitre, was Mr
ohn Webb, Director of the Mblbourne-
ased Overseas Service Bureau, which is
coking for 60 young people to work in
nderdeveloped countries in Asia, Africa
nd the Pacific.
I “It’s not so much an Australian ver-
sion of the American Peace Corps as
i kind of elite corps in reverse,” said
Mr Webb, who came to the Bureau
fter seven years as warden of Mel-
bourne University’s Union House.
Australia needs people with a know-
ledge of overseas conditions just as
fiuch as these countries need specialist
elp. We believe people in Australia
ihould be exposed to the realities of
, ational and racial conflict before there
:» any chance of building international
Understanding.”
l! Mr Webb didn’t want anyone to think
fie was simply recruiting
[missionaries. Naturally it
1 s mainly church work in
Jew Guinea, since the
[Australian Government
akes care of the other
appointments, but in
places like Indonesia
find Basutoland the Bureau often
finds itself asked to supply anything
rom an economics graduate- to a boat
guilder. One of the brightest stars in
;:he scheme, said Mr Webb, exemplify-
ing his elite-corps-in-reverse plan, was
Ken Thomas, now a researcher in Indo-
nesian economic affairs at the Austra-
lian National University after five years
of voluntary service with the Economics
Faculty of Djakarta University.
The Bureau was launched as a full-
time office, with a staff of four, in June,
1963, with an impressive list of 26
patrons (Professor Manning Clark, Sir
Macfarlane Burnett, Gough Whitlam,
Bishop Eris O'Brien) and fairly well
founded hopes of support from the De-
partment of External Affairs.
Good for You
have seen it with the oil companies
and with the manufacturers of
under-garments, but never before have
w e-seen the manufacturers of wholesome
stoi| t fighting it out in the newspapers
of Victoria with full-page advertisements.
In the left corner we have the Carlton-
United Brewery which has been adver-
tising: “Enjoy the only stout to deserve
the name Foster’s”, which some of us
feel is a slur on the name of the same
company’s dear old Abbot’s stout which
we have been drinking for years.
In the right corner we have “My
Goodness . . . My Guinness Goodness!
Guinness is now brewed in Australia
with all its goodness. It’s now brewed
in an Australian brewery by a top
Guinness brewer . . . Guinness even
sends its own special yeast.”
Actually it is very difficult to plumb
the depths of the Carlton - United
Brewery for its true secrets, but the well-
informed liquor trade men say this is the
story. Some time back the Guinness
company approached Carlton-United and
asked them to brew Guinness.
Maybe this was too much for the pride
of the Carlton chairman, the prickly Mr
R. F. G. Fogarty, and the story goes
he knocked back the offer. So Guinness
went to the South Australian Brewing
Co., the home of West End. But the real
market was Melbourne. Melbourne
people drink more stout than anybody in
Australia. But the big fear was this. If
Guinness got a foothold in Victoria with
a good market, heaven knows what
would happen. They have
a brewery in Nigeria and
they are building in
Kuala Lumpur. The po-
licy is to build more. So
if the stout went well, it
would not be hard to get
into the beer 'also.
As soon as Guinness stout hit Mel-
bourne Mr Fogarty brought out his new
Foster’s' stout with a lovely old-style
khaki label. But there is a difference
from the Guinness. The Guinness is
creamier and more bitter on the finish.
There is a difference, too, in the price.
Foster's and Abbot’s sell for 3s. 6d. a
26 oz. bottle. Guinness is 4s. 6d. in
Melbourne for a 22.85 oz. bottle.
Jazz Ballet
The person with a finger in more
theatrical pies than anyone else at
the moment is, probably, choreographer
Miss Betty Pounder. Recently she has
been flying weekly between her home
in Melbourne for a regular check on the
dancing in “How to Succeed in Business
Without Really Trying” in Sydney, and
then back to Melbourne where she
keeps an eye on “Camelot” for which
she did the dances. Added to these
regular chores have been visits to Ade-
laide and now Sydney for the first per-
formances of her ballet “Jazz Spectrum”
with the Australian Ballet Company.

For a decade Miss Pounder has
pretty well been choreography for J. C.
Williamson’s, with whom she worked
aer way up from the chorus-line through
ballet-mistress to choreographer. With
them she has worked in musical comedy,
opera, and Gilbert and Sullivan, but
mostly, except for “The Sentimental
Bloke”, she has either been working as
an assistant to a visiting choreographer
or been recreating dances of another’s
devising. And although she was train-
ed in classical ballet, “Jazz Spectrum” is
her first original work in this field.
Miss Pounder says that “Jazz Spec-
trum” is not “way-out jazz”. However,
in it she has been able to make the
dancers follow her style. “There’s no
standing around the edge of the stage
doing nothing while the solos are on,
like they do in classical ballet,” she
said. “They have to keep moving all
the time.”
Choreography always seems to the
outsider one of the most mystifying of
theatrical arts, particularly the old
tradition of dance steps for full-length
ballets being handed down from one
ballet-master to the next with absolutely
nothing on paper. Miss Pounder said
there was now a fairly satisfactory sys-
tem of dance notation, but it would per-
haps take another generation to prove
its value. She has not yet found time
to learn this notation, which involves an
elaborate study course. She still gets
along with her own system of notes, un-
intelligible to anyone else, and her
memory. Her memory is such that after
playing over the music of any of the
musical comedies she has worked on she
could immediately recreate the dances,
foot-perfect.
Idiots’ Delight
few who respect Australia’s censor-
A ship procedure will be delighted to
learn that a writer named Rudyard Kip-
ling has been under the attention of our
vigilant Customs men. Officials in Perth
seized his “Just So” stories, together
with several of George Bernard Shaw’s
plays and a host of other books bearing
what the department considered to be
suspicious titles.
To officials who are not thriller fans
but remember the Stephen Ward case,
Agatha Christie’s “They Do It With
Mirrors” might well cause shudders.
“Fanny’s First Play” could have been
the opening chapter to “Fanny Hill”
or worse and “The Witch’s Horn” just
could have been a shocker.
But “The Golden Bough” has been
around for quite a few years now am
one would have thought that even tb
Customs Department would have know
Joyce Adamson’s bestseller “Foreve
Free” was about raising lions in you
backyard, not that free love stuff, fi
managers of bookshops in Perth an
Fremantle failed to see much of t|
humor of the situation when commands
to present copies to Customs House-
and not to sell any until they had bee
inspected and passed as fit for the n;ol
The booksellers saw this idiotic ordi
as yet another dislocation in busines
that could have been avoided simply b
the department having some sort of i
list of what books have previously beei
passed or, better still, by the powers
that-be overhauling the whole ram
shackle and lamentable state of censor
ship in this country.

PLAIN ENGLISH
Sir Garfield and Anzus
WHAT exactly is the fuss con-
cerning Sir Garfield Barwick’s
statements on Anzus all about?
Some sections of the Press in dubi-
ous alliance with the Leader of the
Opposition who can never
resist the temptation to make cheap
political propaganda out of serious
questions to which he already
knows the answers are trying
to make out that Sir Garfield’s state-
ment that the US would be involved
through Anzus if Indonesian forces
attacked Australian troops in
Malaysia or Borneo was deliberate-
ly misleading, severely embarrassed
the US and was the cause of Sir
Garfield's new appointment.
The last point is hardly worth
commenting on. The post of Chief
Justice is not one which will wait,
or should wait. The other criticisms
are more serious because they are
deliberately and wilfully evading
the issue. The nub of the question
raised by Mr Calwell and some
newspapers is whether the US is
automatically obliged to come to
Australia’s defence under Anzus if
Australian forces are attacked in the
Pacific. Mr Calwell knows better
than most that the US is completely
committed to its Anzus obligations
and he knows better than most,
if the word “automatic” has to be
used, the difference between Ame-
rica’s automatic obligations under
Anzus and automatic involvement
or action. If Australian troops are
attacked by Indonesian forces in
Borneo, it is clear that the US is
involved under Anzus but what
action it takes is a matter for dis-
cussion between Canberra and
Washington. If Australian troops
are attacked, is America supposed
to prove its good faith as an Anzus
partner by immediately bombing
Djakarta?
Surely this is a matter for good
sense, discussion and consultation.
And as automatic seems to be
the word in dispute it is well to
remember that, in his Press state-
ment, Sir Garfield never did say that
DS involvement under Anzus was
automatic. He said exactly the
contrary, clearly and unequivocally,
and that is why we publish below
what he did say.
In the course of that statement
he said two other things of con-
siderable importance. One was that
the US was well aware of the
Anzus implications of sending Aus-
tralian troops to Borneo. The other
was that Dr Soekarno was well
aware of the same implications last
September. However, it is one thing
for Indonesia’s leaders to know in
private some of the possible con-
sequences of Indonesia’s war in
Borneo, and a much more impor-
tant thing that they should be warn-
ed publicly and soberly by the res-
ponsible Minister in this country.
This is part of Australia’s gradu-
ated response to the threats posed
by an Indonesia who is our neighbor
and with whom we wish to be
friendly, just as the US, although
involved in any action against Aus-
tralian troops under its Anzus ob-
ligations would also seek a gradu-
ated, not an immediate, response.
ITERE is the interview:
* Sir Garfield Barwick: Well now,
who wants to ask something I can’t
answer?
Question: In Manila, Sir, you
referred to the Anzus Treaty if
Indonesia attacked Australian ter-
ritory on Australia’s support for
Malaysia, then this would auto-
matically mean the operation of the
Anzus Treaty. Would you elabor-
ate that a bit more?
Sir Garfield Barwick: Well, I
think that I could repeat very nearly
what I said. I said that the Treaty
expressly covered attacks on Aus-
tralian military personnel or air-
craft or ships in the Pacific area.
Borneo was, for this purpose, within
the Pacific area, and I also said that
both Indonesia and the Philippines
had been made aware of this fact.
Question: Has America been
made aware of this?
Sir Garfield Barwick: Oh, yes,
America is not in doubt about
this. This is not a doubtful point.
Question: It is quite clear that
America feels this is so?
Sir Garfield Barwick: Yes.
Question: In the event of Aus-
tralian engineers in Borneo being
fired on, will we invoke the Anzus
Treaty or is this too hypothetical?
Sir Garfield Barwick: Well, when
you say fired upon, this is a ques-
tion, by whom and in what circum-
stances. I don’t think this is the
sort of question you can answer out
of the blue.
Question: By Indonesians.
Sir Garfield Barwick: Well, if
you make it into an Indonesian at-
tack on our personnel then it would
fall within the Treaty.
Question: Would it be necessary
specifically to invoke the Treaty or
would it be applied automatically?
Sir Garfield Barwick: Well, I
don’t know what you mean by
automatically. The Treaty says
that the United States and the other
members will take action. Then
you have to get down to the detail
of all this. There’s nothing auto-
matic. You can have an automatic
obligation and that attaches auto-
matically, but the activities are not
automatic, I suppose, in any treaty.
Question: Can we put it another
way, Sir. The Australian decision
to send physical forces as an-
nounced yesterday, was that com-
municated to the United States be-
fore action was taken?
Sir Garfield Barwick: The Ame-
ricans knew of this. Yes.
Question: This increases the
chance of American involvement
then in the Malaysian situation?
Sir Garfield Barwick: Well, I
suppose it does. This depends very
much on so many imponderables
we can only say that it does.
Question: Have the Indonesian
authorities been quietly told that
the Anzus Treaty docs operate?
Sir Garfield Barwick: Oh, yes,
they know. You know, this goes
back to when I saw Soekarno last
September. This was made plain
and he himself said to me that he
knew that he would be opposed by
the British and by us and by the
Americans. He said that then, so
that this is not a case where the
Indonesians don’t know the risk.


THIS AUSTRALIA
FEDERAL POLITICS
The Dynastic Struggles
While Harwich goes and Whitlam stays
FROM ALAN REID IN CANBERRA
SIR GARFIELD, CJ
Departure
T ast week the Menzies Government
temporarily solved its succession
struggle, while at the same time Labor
plunged deeper into its dynastic morass.
Sir Garfield Barwick, now Chief Jus-
tice, was always potentially a rival for
the Prime Ministership against Harold
Holt, whenever Menzies decided to quit.
Holt and Barwick have been good per-
sonal friends, but when the “stakes” are
big a clash of ambition always produces
some strain in a party. With Barwick
gone from the political arena, Holt is
back in the position of Liberal heir-
apparent.
It is, of course, only a temporary eas-
ing of the strain for the Liberals. There
is nothing more certain than that a new
rival for Holt will emerge sooner or
later. The Prime Ministership is too
large a prize to be allowed to go by
default. But it will take a while for the
rival to emerge and to build up a follow-
ing, and until then the strain is off for
both Holt and the Liberal Party.
Labor's leadership problems, however,
are only beginning. There is obvious
bad feeling between Labor leader Arthur
Calwell, who led the party to its disas-
trous rout at the last elections, and his
deputy who has frankly analysed and
given reasons for the rout in a report
to the NSW ALP Executive. This re-
port reflected both on Labor’s leader-
ship during the years prior to the elec-
tions and the inferior quality of Labor
parliamentarians and candidates.
Now Senator Archie Benn, from
Queensland, has brought some of the un-
easiness out into the open, with his notice
of motion in the Labor Caucus declaring
vacant the post of Opposition Senate
Leader now held by Nick McKenna,
once an intimate of the last Labor Prime
Minister, the late Ben Chifley. Benn
took his action because he believes Mc-
Kenna was a party to the muzzling of
Senators in a Senate Foreign Affairs de-
bate, which because of the Labor boy-
cott, produced considerable embarrass-
ment for the Labor Party. It is claimed
by those who are against rocking the
Labor boat at this stage that Benn has
no significant Caucus backing for his
move. This may be so.
But the Labor Party is a party in which
nerves are tense and tempers uncertain.
There is always the chance that some
wild man, when the Benn motion comes
up for discussion, may say “Let's declare
all leadership positions vacant”. If that
happens the party could explode, and
pent-up feelings express themselves in
action that could topple the present
leadership.
Calwell's supporters are contributing
heavily to the existing tension. They
want Gough Whitlam, who as Deputy
Leader is the official Labor heir-apparent,
destroyed. They are trying to foster an
alliance between two ideological extremes
—Fred Daly (NSW), of the Right, and
Jim Cairns (Vic.), of the Left. They
argue that if these two get together they
can cut Whitlam’s political throat and
share the leadership between themselves,
There is a certain amount of un-
reality about this. When the chips come
down it is unlikely that Daly could, or
would, back Cairns or that Cairns could,
or would, back Daly.
Even if they could bring themselves
to provide mutual support their followers
would not follow them into such an alli-
ance. To this extent the Calwell sup-
porters' exercise is meaningless, but it is
straining nerves already strained. Even
if Benn's move is squashed and gets no-
where it is only deferring the evil day.
The dynastic rivalry in the Labor
Party can only get worse until the issue
is finally settled.
Of the two, despite the Labor blast
against the manner of Barwick's appoint-
ment to the Chief Justiceship, it is the
Liberal Party rather than the Labor
Party which finished last week in the
happier position.
TAXATION
The Case Against Payroll Tax
Holt's Hint
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
jyjß H. E. Holt’s hint to the Federated
Taxpayers Associations’ Annual
Conference in Sydney last week that the
next Loan Council meeting would con-
sider reducing Government expenditure
naturally raised hopes for a reduction
in taxation. But Conference members
remained sceptical because they feared
that the Treasurer was thinking more on
the lines of cutting back Government
investment to make more room for pri-
vate enterprise in a situation where total
investment is pressing against limits im-
posed by the current labor shortage in
basic industries.
However, the Conference delegates
were seemingly of one accord in thinking
taxation should be reduced. “We lose
both ways, said Mr L. A. Langridge, a
NSW Vice-President, “because in bad
times people have to pay taxes so the
public service can function and in good
times to stop them spending too much.”
The delegates left no doubt that come
fair or foul financial weather one tax,
the payroll tax, should be dropped from
the annual calendar altogether and Mr
J. G. Munro (Queensland) proceeded to
sum up the iniquities of this tax as
follows: It was not related to ability to
pay and therefore offended a primary
principle of just taxation; it added to the
cost of labor and so restricted employ-
ment (this can hardly apply at present);
it added directly to the cost of production
and so to the cost of living (the consumer
price index rose 0.6 per cent in the
March quarter, the first big jump in three
years); it was a sectional tax, being
directed only against employers; and
finally, since State and Local Govern-
ment authorities had to pay the tax, its
abolition would assist in meeting their
needs which otherwise might eventually
have to be financed by the Federal Gov-
ernment. At least the last argument
should appeal to the Treasurer, but it
probably not appeal sufficiently for him
to scrap it.


THE ECONOMY
Dr Kojima’s Indictment
“Australians lack courage ”
FROM J. C. HORSFALL IN MELBOURNE
DR KOJIMA
Mixed up
rPHE importance of the trenchant criti-
cism of our economic set-up made
by Japanese economist Dr Kiyoshi
Kojima, on his return from an extended
official lecturing visit to these parts, is
not so much the irritation caused here
by seeing ourselves as others see us; it is
rather that an essay, which falls down
not only on points of fact but in inter-
pretation, has apparently received wide
currency in Japan where it is vital for
our future trade that what w'e have done,
are doing and intend to do on the eco-
nomic front, should be properly under-
stood.
For a start, Dr Kojima is all mixed
up on the planning question. In one
breath he talks of this being a “social-
ised controlled economy” and in the next
that our economic policy is “extremely
vague”. One cannot help feeling that
he has got altogether the wrong end of
the stick, mistaking the network of prim-
ary industry boards and commissions
for a “framed competition” economy. It
is very thick, indeed, to say that this
framed competition economy leads to a
disregard for efficiency in resource allo-
cation, to the anaesthetising of a vigor-
ous entrepreneurial spirit, and to a pre-
ference for maintaining stability and the
status quo over rapid progress.
Dr Kojima is astray when he says we
are cherishing a dream of a huge golf
course and failing to follow the lead of
America and make up our minds to em-
bark on thoroughgoing industrialisation.
In fact one of the most persistent com-
plaints levied against us by economists in
Britain, for instance, is that we have
been developing the industrial side of
the economy too rapidly—“pouring
capital down the drain of an industrial
boom as the London “Economist” once
Put it. Our industrial development is
not an afterthought to absorb labor we
cant place in primary’ industry, as Dr
Kojima suggests, but rather a matter of
purposeful policy.
Dr Kojima’s charge that there is a
lack of enthusiasm for industrialisation
and diversification here was countered by
the Federal Director of the Associated
Chamber of Manufactures, Mr R. N. C.
Anderson, saying during the week that
it seems incredible to think that a visiting
economist could believe that we were
not hellbent on such a policy.
Mr Anderson felt so strongly that he
thought somebody must have got at Dr
Kojima when he was here and that “it
may be necessary for the Government
to publicly restate its determination to
press forward with a policy of industrial
growth for Australia so as to leave the
Japanese people and their Government
in no doubt as to our intention to
rapidly industrialise and certainly not to
have a depertdent economy status with
any single nation”.
However, it is not so difficult to see
what Dr Kojima is getting at in his
criticisms of the scope and efficiency of
our secondary industry, because his cen-
tral purpose is, seemingly, to find
methods of reducing the huge trade gap
in Australia’s favor with Japan. “If
Australia tries to maintain its present
policy of exporting primary produce
and protecting consumer goods industries
there will be little room for expanding
trade and economic co-operation with
Japan and South-East Asia, he says.
He asks bluntly, “Why does Australia
not set up a plan for doubling heavy
industry?” since "only in this way can
labor be transferred from the inefficient
consumer goods, light industry, sector
into the efficient heavy industrial sector
and an efficient re-allocation of resources
achieved. But Australia did not have the
courage to face danger. They produce
their butter, cheese and lamb and are
content to fold their hands and w'ait.”
We are, of course, getting increasingly,
into heavy industry, but at this stage,
without a bigger home market behind
us, it would be absurd to attempt to
compete in export markets on a large
scale in capital goods with the older
industrial nations, even with Japan itself.
Furthermore, it is strongly to our eco-
nomic advantage to import the greater
part of our requirements of such plant
and equipment and, because industry
here can cater for most of our con-
sumption goods needs.
Nevertheless Dr Kojima has touched
us on the quick of our commercial
policies. If he has done nothing else by
having his article translated (somewhat
imperfectly perhaps) for consumption
here as well as in Japan, Dr Kojima has
made us more alive than ever to the
problem of accommodating more imports
from Japan.
UNIONS
Left Out
Jordan wins
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
Predictions that Mr M. C. (“Mick”)
Jordan would win the Secretaryship
of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council
by about 20 votes in a poll of 280 were
not far out; in fact, Mr Jordan, formerly
Assistant-Secretary to the late Mr Vic
Stout, beat his Left-wing opponent, Mr
Jack Wood, by 13 votes in a poll of 275.
Both factions wore themselves to the
limit in mustering supporters, but in the
end the relatively small “centre” faction
settled the issue in favor of Mr Jordan.
Mr Jordan’s win does not mean that
the Right wing can expect their nominee
to win the post of Assistant-Secretary
which he has vacated. The election for
this will not be held for three or four
weeks but it will be just as keenly fought
as last week’s Jordan-Wood contest.
There is no obvious claimant for this
post, either from the Left or the Right,
but Mr Jordan’s win has made the Left
more determined than ever to take the
position.
Mr Wood, if he stands for the Assis-
tant-Secretaryship, should have no
trouble in tipping the scales again against
the Right wing this time. However, he
was a reluctant candidate in last week’s
election and his Left-wing supporters
will find it far more difficult to talk him
into running for the lesser position.
Talking on the THC Secretaryship would
have involved him in a financial sacrifice
which would be much greater if he took
the lesser post (losing his £3OOO per
annum job as THC representative on the
Supplementary Workers’ Compensation
Board).
With Mr Wood out of the field, neither
the Left nor the Right appears to have
any strong candidates at this stage. Fail-
ing Mr Wood, the Left may propose Mr
Paul Johnston of the Blacksmiths’
Union. Mr Johnson has been increas-
ingly prominent of late in the manifold
activities of the Left wing from the
“Peace movement” right through to de-
fending the Central Executive of the
ALP at a recent Fabian Conference.
Albert McNolty and the small junta of
militant union officials who run the
Victorian ALP have obviously marked
Mr Johnston for big things.

LEGAL AID
30 Cases the First Day
Victorian Lawyers Act
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
M. V. McINERNEY
Leadership
There is an air of affluence about
multi-storied Sir Owen Dixon
Chambers, opposite the Law Courts in
William Street, Melbourne, where most
of Melbourne’s barristers have their
chambers, but the legal profession has
not forgotten the plight of those too
poor to engage its services. It is fitting,
therefore,- that Victoria’s new office for
providing legal aid to citizens who need
but cannot afford it should be located
on the ground floor of the Dixon build-
ing.
The initiative for the new legal aid
bureau came from the lawyers them-
selves and it will operate through their
voluntary services. The Bolte Govern-
ment, which legislated the bureau into
being at the request of the Bar Council’s
president, Mr M. Mclnerney, QC, and
the Law Institute, will provide a modest
£11,850 for its operation this year. The
actual organisation of legal help will be
m the hands of the bureau’s committee,
consisting of two barristers from the Bar
Council and two solicitors representing
the Law Institute. To handle cases, the
committee will call on the services of
the State’s 1700 solicitors and 300
barristers.
As full-time staff, the bureau has a
secretary, assistant-secretary and two
typiste-receptionists. The secretary is Mr
John Heffernan who has had eleven
years experience as a solicitor, and his
assistant is Mr J. F. M ylan, an experi-
enced law clerk. These will interview
applicants and place cases for its con-
sideration before the committee.
Some legal aid to the needy is already
available in Victoria through the public
solicitors office. However, this office is
th iged to apply a means test so strict
at only the well-nigh destitute can
qualify for help. The test is ownership of
~ 50 Property. In addition, the help of
e public solicitor is not available for
ose whose cases need to be fought in
ltle lower courts.
The new bureau will have no hard
an d and fast rules over the means of
applicants. It will consider each case
° n its merits, including the sum at stake
an the income and obligations of the
applicant. Quite a large strata of the
Population will be eligible, typified per-
haps by the wage-earner with commit-
ments to a family and paying off a house
who has little, if anything, to spare to
pay for the justice which is his right.
In most cases it is not envisaged that
the aid will be completely free. Where
it considers that an applicant can make
some contribution, the committee will
ask a payment. If appropriate, this
may be in terms of a small weekly sum
over a period. Flexibility will be the
keynote of the system.
In cases where an aided person wins
damages, the cost of the legal aid will
be obtained from the sum awarded. For
record purposes, barristers and solicitors
helping in bureau cases will submit a
note of their charges. Moneys received
by the bureau from those it has helped,
or out of successful damages cases, will
be paid into a trust fund. At the end
of each year this will be split up among
barristers and solicitors who have helped
its work. In this way there will be
some recompense to the volunteers, but
nothing like the full market value of
the services they have rendered.
Mr Heffernan told The Bulletin
that on the day the bureau opened there
had been thirty callers. Some, however,
proved to be cases which needed social
service help rather than legal aid. These
have been referred to social service
agencies which have also been circu-
larised by the bureau, advising of its
activities.
Similar bureaux are operating in all
States except NSW and Queensland. In
Queensland there are moves to follow
Victoria. The WA scheme will not help
in divorce matters, but covers criminal
cases. Criminal cases come within the
scope of the SA and Tasmanian
schemes. In practice, the Tasmanian
scheme does not become involved in
divorce cases. In Victoria there will be
no aid in criminal cases nor to those
wishing to institute divorce proceedings.
There will be help for divorce respon-
dents, provided they qualify in other
regards.
Legal men consider that the bureau
will be of great help to persons who
have been successful in lower court
actions, but are subsequently faced with
appeal proceedings in the higher courts
which they cannot afford to defend. In
cases like these the bureau will be able
to ensure a citizen is not denied justice
solely through inability to meet inevitable
costs.
The purpose of the Act was summed
up in its opening words: “Whereas the
members of the Legal Profession in
Victoria believe that no person should be
without legal assistance by reason of
being unable to pay . .
COMPOSERS
Money for
Music?
Like writers
FROM JOHN SMALL IN SYDNEY
TI/Toves are developing fast for the
establishment of a Commonwealth
Music Fund, which would assist com-
posers in the same sort of way as the
Commonwealth Literary Fund assists
writers. The proposal dates back two
years when the Fellowship of Australian
Composers first approached the Prime
Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, about
composers’ problems only to receive the
answer that the Government was “not
in a position at this time to offer any
specialised assistance in the field of
musical composition”.
Since then the composers have gath-
ered support from parliamentarians,
including an inner Cabinet member, the
Minister for Supply, Mr Alan Fairhall,
and the heads of Australian conserva-
toriums.
In Parliament recently Mr G. W. A.
Duthie (Labor, Tas.), outlining proposals
for the fund, suggested it could start
with £lO,OOO a year, compared with the
CLF's £25,000.
The Fellowship, to which most signi-
ficant Australian composers belong,
wants the proposed fund to give finan-
cial assistance to the publication of local
composers’ works, so that music pro-
duced in Australia will have a chance of
being performed overseas. Mr George
English, the Fellowship's secretary, said
last week that overseas performers have
expressed interest in playing Australian
works, but that this will remain impos-
sible while these works exist only in
manuscript. At present, composition is
only a part-time business for Australian
composers, most of whom have full-
time jobs—often with the ABC or at
conservatoriums. Help from a fund
could enable them to spend more time
on composition than most of them now
have. The fund would also back the
production of records, and assist com-
posers to study overseas and to come
into contact with other composers.

DEVELOPMENT
An A-Bomb
for Geraldton?
A big bang for peace
FROM A PERTH CORRESPONDENT
CHARLES COURT
Enthusiastic
sleepy port of Geraldton, 200 miles
north of Perth, may be the site for
Australia’s first, peaceful, nuclear ex-
plosion—in a plan to deepen its harbor.
The crayfishing port and hub of a
rich wheat-growing district has recently
been given the added impetus of iron
ore deposits inland at Tallering Peak
and Koolanooka. But the port of
Geraldton simply cannot handle big ore-
carriers.
Last year the West Australian Gov-
ernment was given a disheartening
thumbs-down on plans to deepen the
harbor by conventional means. The
rock does not fracture, and the US con-
sultants told the Government that they
would be lucky to get a tender for the
tedious and costly job.
Then the Government got in touch
with Washington, DC, harbor engineers,
Palmer and Baker, who have been work-
ing with the US Atomic Energy Com-
mission on Operation Plowshare, investi-
gating the peaceful uses of the atom.
The Minister for Works, Gerry Wild,
arranged through the US Consul, Tom
Mayfield, for the company to discuss the
plan last month with touring Charles
Court, Minister for Industrial Develop-
ment and the North-West. And Court
brought home an enthusiastic report:
“Palmer and Baker consider Gerald-
ton Harbor could make an ideal project
to prove their ideas on the use of
thermal nuclear energy. There are many
advantages and no apparent inter-
national complications. It is an isolated
spot and no international boundaries
impinge on the area. On the technical
side, they say it wouldn't hurt marine
life farther away than five miles, and the
only protection for the local population
they would need would be an offshore
wind at 10 mph.”
The Minister said, however, that the
US group emphasised the need for a
thorough “feasibility test” on four
grounds: (1) that the harbor and its
approaches could, in fact, be deepened
by the use of nuclear thermal power;
(2) that the blasts could be effectively
controlled; (3) that the cost would not
be prohibitive; (4) that permission be
received from all signatories to the inter-
national Test Ban Treaty.
Court added: “It is felt in Washing-
ton that because of the nature of this
project, without international complica-
tions, it should be possible to get per-
mission to go ahead.”
The man who has been given much
of the credit for this idea is 57-year-old
retired Major J. G. Porteus, a chemist
at the nearby country town of Dongara,
an avid science hobbyist, and dedicated
writer of letters to the editor.
Two years ago, after reading about
Operation Plowshare, he wrote to the
US Atomic Energy Commission, the
Geraldton Press, the Perth Press, the
Geraldton Town Council, and the Public
Works Department to point out the
possibilities for the harbor.
Costs are not clear. One estimate is
£9 million. However, if Palmer and
Baker are asked to come to WA—as they
say they would like to be —it could well
be that a more cheaper technique of
opening the harbor by nuclear means
might be found.
JUDGES
Controlling an Attorney-General
“King James v. Judge Rapke ”
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
as his ground the debate in
the Legislative Council on the
Qualifications for Judges Bill (the object
of which is to make it possible for a
County Court Judge to be appointed to
the Supreme Court Bench), the Leader
of the Opposition in the Council, Mr J.
W. Galbally, appeared to be taking The
Bulletin of February 19 to task.
Mr Galbally said that “no responsible
person would suggest that a judge is
free from criticism. Of course he can
be criticised. I noticed recently in the
columns of a newspaper a suggestion
that it was wrong even to imply to the
contrary. Everybody in the commun-
ity, except the Executive, is free to criti-
cise a judge.”
In its editorial “Plain English” (“King
James v. Judge Rapke”) discussing the
Victorian Bar Council’s criticism of the
Victorian Attorney-General, Mr A.
Rylah, for his attack on Judge Rapke’s
decisions, The Bulletin wanted to
know on what principle an Attorney-
General should be denied the right of
all men to criticise a judge. In a
questioning mood on a difficult subject,
The Bulletin speculated: “If judges
are to be criticised when they deserve
criticism, who is better placed to do
this than an Attorney-General? If it
is suggested that such a Minister should
be more ‘discreet’ and not engage in
public criticism but act privately, then
do we really want public affairs con-
ducted secretly behind the scenes away
from public scrutiny? There are no
obvious answers to these questions be-
cause the public also believes in the
independence of the judiciary and its
separation from the executive.” We in-
vited the Victorian Bar Council to have
a long look at this question “instead of
giving the public confusing and incon-
sistent guidance.”
The question is clearly whether it is
proper for the Executive, especially the
Attorney-General, to criticise a judge.
“This matter,” said Mr Galbally, “was
dealt with by the House of Commons as
late as 1843 in the case of Lord Abin-
ger, whose conduct was called in ques-
tion, and it was there stated that no
government should support a motion
for an inquiry into the conduct of a
judge unless it had first made an inves-
tigation and was prepared to say that
it thought it a fit case to be followed
up by an address for his dismissal. It is
quite obvious, it was stated, if this is to
be the correct principle, that no govern-
ment should directly admonish a judge
unless it was proposed at that time to
remove him.”
Getting down to Mr Rylah's recent
criticism of Judge Rapke, Mr Galbally
went on, “The evil of the Attorney-
General criticising a judge short of
removal —is that the judge would say,
‘I must not do it again; I have been
warned; if I do it again I may be re-
moved’. That is where Mr Rylah went
seriously wrong and broke a long tra-
dition,” he added. “If we are to allow
the Attorney-General to criticise a judge,
we immediately eat into the principle of
judicial independence.”


ELECTIONS
Brisbane Votes
Calwell's predictions
FROM A BRISBANE CORRESPONDENT
CLEM JONES
Dictator?
years ago, Federal Parlia-
A mentary ALP leader Arthur Calwell
hailed the win of Labor in the Brisbane
City Council election as the start of
the party's return to power in Australia.
But later in 1961, the Liberal-Country
parties scraped back at the Federal
election and last year firmly re-establish-
ed themselves. Now, this Saturday, the
Brisbane City Council election will be
held again, with a Labor Council seek-
ing re-election. The Labor Lord Mayor
(Alderman Jones) won by 27,000 votes
last time in the era of the credit squeeze
which savagely swept the Liberal-leaning
Citizens’ Municipal Organisation out of
power. On the Federal and State elec-
tion figures, the CMO would regain
power easily, but several other factors
have to be considered. For example, to
relieve unemployment, the Federal
Government channelled much money to
State Governments and local authorities
and, as a result, a lot of work has been
done in Brisbane. The fact that this
could have been carried out by any
administration could very well be for-
gotten or not known by many electors,
On the face of it, Brisbane at last seems
on the move, after years of being in
the doldrums. Against this, to the dis-
advantage of the ALP has been Alder-
man Jones’ attitude which has lost him
a lot of friends. The CMO has concen-
trated its attack on him, as being what
it calls the chink in the Labor armor.
CMO speakers have referred to him as
arrogant and dictatorial, and Alderman
Jones has replied that people who try
to get things done have always been
called these things. His CMO opponent,
Mr S. R. Ricketts, a former big branch
manager of the National Bank, is cam-
paigning strenuously.
At present, the ALP holds the Lord
Mayoralty and 16 of the 28 wards, with
the CMO representing the rest. It is
one of the hardest elections to predict
in the city’s history, but if voters con-
tinue to vote on party lines as in the
Federal and State elections, Labor will
go in Brisbane too. If not, Mr Calwell
can start predicting again.
PERJURERS
ffi^ulCetCn
80 Years Ago: May 3, 1884
agrarian system for which Sir
John Robertson is responsible,
and to which he owes his order of
knighthood, has been impotent to
settle a population upon the soil. But
it has operated most effectually to
demoralise all whom its provisions
touched, in the matter of oaths and
affirmations. It has offered pre-
miurns for perjury. However difficult
it might be for men to get employ-
ment in a pastoral district by straight-
forward exertion, there has always
been an easy livelihood and a fifty-
pound note ready for the acceptance
of any individual who would under-
take the duty of “dummying” land—
in other words, who would procure
land for another person by solemnly
affirming that it was for himself. And
for men of larger opportunities there
has been only one way of securing a
compact estate, and that has been
by wholesale subornation of perjury
—by offering inducements to people
open to temptation to perjure them-
selves. During the last twenty years
the whole influence of the legalised
system of dealing with the public
lands has been to render it impractic-
able for a rigidly conscientious man
to compete in the struggle for ma-
terial progress against the man who
elected to regard perjury as a neces-
sary and inevitable peccadillo thrust
upon him by the framers of the laws
relating to real estate. Employment
in the pastoral districts has even so
generally been coupled with condi-
tions of false swearing—dummying
for the master that the strictly
truthful man w'ho shrunk from put-
ing perjury on his soul has been at
a complete disadvantage.
“Rum”, slightly more crapu-
A lous than usual, hiccups thusly:
“We know we must look to the
Churches, not to the State, for the
noblest elements of the civilisation
which all true Britons desire to see
upbuilt in Australia.” To the
Churches? For what, oh “Rum”?
For independence of thought? for
manliness and liberty of life? for
toleration? for individuality? For
what, for what, O most ridiculous
RUM? Why, even for Christianity
one is but a fool to look to the
Churches. It is to scientific educa-
tion we must look.
BUSINESS
HP Catches Up
The nasty cat
FROM A MELBOURNE CORRESPONDENT
/General Motors Acceptance Cor-
poration threw a nasty cat among
the HP pigeons when, a few weeks ago.
it reduced its flat rate on HP financing
of new motor vehicles from 7 to 6 per
cent. For now, despite a recent letter
to The Bulletin from the Chairman
of the Australian Hire Purchase and
Financing Conference saying we did not
know the facts of HP life when we
asked why, in view of the considerable
reduction in the companies’ borrowing
rates, they can’t bring down their lend-
ing charge (The Bulletin, February
22), all the big companies have now
cut their rates in line with GMAC.
Admittedly the GMAC move was
dictated as much by its concern to stop
other companies nibbling away at its
captive HP business in Holden’s as by the
reductions in borrowing rates (GMAC
borrowing power is strengthened by the
US parent company’s unconditional
guarantee of local borrowings), but it has
caught the other companies on the
wrong foot; and it may even have
caught them out for not passing on
their own easier borrowing terms earlier.
The irony of the situation is that they
have had to cut their charges at a time
when the Reserve Bank has decided the
downward movement in interest rates has
gone too far. Naturally their tangle over
interest rates has jaundiced investors in
their shares, and it has not helped that
HP outstandings fell slightly in February,
the first monthly drop for a year. After
heavy selling last week, the shares were
averaging out about 10 per cent lower
than at the start of the year despite the
general rise in the market.


The Monash Story —7
Keeping Them Down on the Farm
Melbourne’s “other” university
By BATMAN
At Monash the professorial gentle-
men like to talk about the
35-acre car-park and the rather
delicious fact that it is roughly the same
size as the teaching area of Melbourne
University. Indeed, there is a story about
a young man who announced that he
had decided to go to Monash. His father
was well pleased. At last his son was
thinking for himself. Obviously the boy
had investigated the merits of the two
universities, he had studied the various
courses with care and he had come to
the interesting decision of Monash.
“Why Monash?” he said. “That’s
simple, Dad. It's the only place where
you can park the car.”
Monash was magnificently situated
for the future. Its 250 acres were chosen
with all the cunning that Myers used for
hs neighboring Chadstone shopping
centre. It is 12 miles from Melbourne
on Princes Highway in the suburb of
Clayton, right where the population ex-
plosion is taking place. Then, it is within
easy motoring distance of Burke Road.
If you take in a mile either side of
Surke Road, you get Balwyn, Kew,
Camberwell, Toorak, Malvern and Caul-
field, or what is known as the sweet
sherry belt.
Professor Joe Bornstein of the Bio-
chemistry Department says Burke Road
goes for a straight 11 miles and he feels
•t is the longest continuous belt of well-
fed suburbia in the world, and naturally
a marvellous recruiting ground for a
university. It is hardly surprising, then,
that 30 per cent of the students are
driven or drive their own cars. Even so,
for many it is imperative. One of the
great agonies of the new university is
the fact that public transport is hopeless-
ly inadequate and at night non-existent.
If it were easy to get digs around
Monash this problem would be different,
but Clayton is new. The average house-
holder is aged about 35, has two or
three children. It is one of the suburbs,
as described by Barry Humphries,
“where the cream brick veneers stay
hygienic for years.” Clayton is not like-
dear old Carlton. There’s no space for
boarders. Recently Monash sent out
10,000 reply-paid cards around the area
looking for accommodation and from
these there were 96 replies. Only 25
were of any use.
Transport and accommodation are
just two of the many growing pains. The
Vice-Chancellor, Dr J. A. L. Matheson,
says that Monash, but for the University
of Nigeria, is the fastest-growing univer-
sity in the world. Nigeria, he says, is
only moving faster because it is getting
help from the University of Michigan
under the Agency for International
Development programme.
The first graduates of Monash have
just received their degrees. The Univer-
sity was established by an Act of the Vic-
torian Parliament on April 15, 1958.
The Bolte Government accepted the ad-
vice of the Murray Committee and here
lies an intriguing story —The Case of
Missing Page Nine.
The Registrar, Mr F. H. Johnson,
says that the report from Sir Keith
Murray went from the Government to
the Interim Committee for Monash.
The report was detailed, especially page
nine, the last page, which gave a sugges-
ted schedule for timing. The report said
that Monash should open in 1964 or
1965. The report arrived with no page
nine. The Interim Committee was un-
aware of its existence. It went into
action, calling for architects, calling for
funds, arranging for staff. The Universi-
ties Commission could not understand
the extraordinary hurry.
So Monash actually opened for busi-
ness on March 11, 1961, instead of
March, 1964. Other influences must
have been at work but Mr Johnson still
feels that we should not underestimate
the importance of the disappearance of
page nine.
Dr Matheson, a former Professor of
Engineering at Melbourne University
and at Manchester University, also a
M.Sc., Manchester, and Ph.D., Birm-
ingham, and a genuine North Country-
man, arrived from England at the begin-
ning of 1960 to start work. There was a
house for him at Monash, but not much
space. At the beginning he had the
Registrar and staff using the bedrooms

as offices. His most vivid memory of
that time is mud. In 1960 it never stop-
ped raining and they had to keep a row
of gumboots on the porch.
Dr Matheson said: “I was interviewed
on television by Rohan Rivett. The pro-
gramme ended with the camera panning
on to a pile of books. It would have
been much better if it had finished with
my gumboots.”
The University grew steadily. Dr
Matheson laid down the law that there
would be no temporary buildings. “Put
up a temporary building and you have
it round the place for 30 years,” he said.
So all the buildings have an immense
solidity as if they were trying to fight this
idea of anything ever being temporary.
There is a basic pattern of style and
materials right through, and great use of
what we used to call in Sydney liver
brick. However, the old lamb’s fry, in
contrast with great use of white and
glass, looks much better than it ever did
in Sydney.
The first building you see from
Princes Highway, long before you reach
Monash, is the Robert Menzies School
of Humanities. If that sounds a little
pompous you can use the language of
the students and call it the Ming Wing.
The story goes that Sir Lesley Martin
intimated to the Chancellor, Sir Robert
Blackwood, that it would probably
please the old man if they named the
big building after him. And there’s no
doubt that this did please him,
immensely.
Sir Robert Blackwood wrote to Sir
Robert Menzies for permission and Sir
Robert replied: “Call it the Robert
Menzies School of Humanities.”
This was a trifle awkward. There was
no School of Humanities as such
merely a large building which embraced
many faculties and activities. It could
have been called the Menzies Building,
but one suspects that Sir Robert always
thought of the John Curtin School of
Medicine at the National University,
and his School of Humanities, by golly,
was going to be bigger and grander.
And it is big. It is 12 storeys high and
it is being extended to 460 feet long at
a total cost of £2i million. The next
step will be to add another wing forming
a T, which will make it one of the big-
gest buildings in the country.
Cheaper by escalator
Tt has some unusual features. There
are escalators up to the" 1 ninth floor.
When the first extension is finished it
will house 5000 students. As Dr Mathe-
son says, there will be so much traffic
they worked out that escalators would
be cheaper than putting in a dozen lifts.
For such a big building the overall
effect is unusually satisfying. Most big,
modern buildings look like an automat
and you feel the windows ought to pop
up and give you a pie or a sandwich, but
here the dime-in-the-slot scheme had
been broken by good use of color and
tile.
Although, they have had a devil of a
time with wind. It stands there like a
great sail to the north wind and on diffi-
cult days little freshettes down below
can be tossed like streamers as they
open doors. Up above the sensitive and
skilful can play a symphony by the co-
ordinated opening and closing of
windows.
Dr Matheson said that they tested a
model of the building in a wind tunnel
and some of the effects were quite inter-
esting; for example, the way the wind
struck the face of the building and went
up and down. Rain could travel in a
reverse direction up the building. “This
meant,” he said, “perhaps we should
give consideration to windows being up-
side down, so that the flashing goes the
other way.”
In this area there are four buildings,
the Ming Wing, the glassy Union
building which should have been finish-
ed for the start of term and will be
lucky if it’s ready for third term, the
Main Library and the proposed adminis-
trative block. The square formed by
these four buildings is huge, as if
Monash were trying to compete with the
Red Square, the Palazzo San Marco or
such. Anyway it should be most spec-
tacular, and with the right fountains,
the glory of the campus. That American
term is accepted at Monash. You will
be told: “A campus is a campus—what
the hell else would you call it?”
The building next to the Ming Wing
is the Main Library and for one who
remembers the old library at Melbourne
University, where we were starved for
cigarettes and had to queue up for a
seat or sit on a windowsill, this is Eldo-
rado. The interior is as good as the
Tokyo Hilton.
Inside there is the same leisurely,
quiet atmosphere as in a good Hilton —
elegant, modern armchairs with ashtrays
at the elbow, wall-to-wall carpet through-
out and good pictures on the walls. The
use of pure wool carpet may seem sur-
prising but all this has been worked out.
The experts took the life of a carpet as
10 years which meant that in 20 years
all costs, including maintenance, would
come to £160,000. On the other hand
the cost of any other floor covering,
what with the cleaning and polishing
over 20 years, would come to £200,000.
Hence the appearance of the Tokyo
Hilton.
Trend upward
next stage for the library will be to
start work on the first of four stack-
ing towers, each of which will go up to
nine storeys. That is the interesting trend
in the architecture at Monash. It is up-
ward. Although there are 250 acres
available, there’s the terror of repeating
all the old mistakes of Melbourne Uni-
versity and that before long the place
will be like Flinders Street Station.
After all, they have been warned to
prepare for 18,000 students by 1975
and possibly 25,000 after that. So the
Red Square area will have a real down-
town Manhattan look; the towers of
the library, the lofty Ming Wing, six
storeys of the Medical School and the
Monash University Hospital behind.
The hospital has always been planned
for Monash, a need for the University
and a need for the Clayton area. They
hope that it will be coming in stages
about 1970. It will be an 800-bed hospi-
tal and at least 18 storeys high. Royal
Melbourne Hospital has only about 650
beds. The cost of facilities, plus the
nursing home, will be over £l6 million.
There was a small panic at the Uni-
versity recently. A firm of funeral direc-
tors was making very convincing moves
for land right opposite the site for the
University Hospital. Professor Rod An-
drew, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine,
felt that a group of undertakers there
wouldn’t be very good PR' It would be
like a sign: Abandon hope all ye who
enter here.”
The same lofty treatment is planned
for the residential colleges. Deakin Hall
opened its doors in 1962. It now houses
92 students but it is of comparatively
low structure. Dr Matheson is keen that
the next residential college will be a
space-saving 12 storeys. “If you have to
put in lifts and go above four storeys it’s
best to have a 12-storey building to
make the lifts a proposition,” he said.
Of course, there are tears. All these
skyscrapers on the campus destroy the
leafy, cloistered tradition. Men like Pro-
fessor Cochrane, Dean of the Faculty of
Economics and Politics, have little time
for this outlook. They fail to see why
tall buildings shouldn’t function as effi-
ciently, it not more so, than low
buildings.
What the Churches will do remains
to be seen. The policy of the University
is that no denominational colleges will
be allowed on the campus. The 250

acres is too precious. If the Churches
want their own colleges, then they have
to buy their own land elsewhere.
The Catholics were the first to move.
They bought land right opposite the
front gate and their building will be
called Mannix College.
This is the picked spot and some hands
are enjoying the thought that the name
of the archbishop will lord it over the
entrance to the University.
The Protestant Churches are combin-
ing operations. They will leave Mannix
in splendid isolation and at the moment
they are negotiating for 15 acres over on
the other side, close to Deakin Hall. The
denominational colleges are banned
from the campus, but in return they will
get one concession, a religious centre.
This will be on the campus and it will
be inter-denominational. The Protestant
Churches already have their full-time
Monash chaplain, Rev P. J. E. J.
Hawkes. The Catholics and the Jews
have part-time chaplains.
But what about the character of
Monash? In 1961 the newspapers al-
ways called it “The Farm,” as opposed
to Melbourne University which was
“The- Shop.” However, if you call Mel-
bourne University “The Shop” you are
making yourself a little dated and
demonstrating that your degree is be-
coming mildewed. Now the only people
who call Monash “The Farm” are those
who want to be derisive.
The students, of course, are young
and fiercely loyal with an almost school-
boy “school spirit” loyalty. They have
to fight an insinuation that they are just
the spill-over, the no-hopers that
couldn’t get into Melbourne University.
This situation, if ever it existed, is
changing.
Getting the cream
T'he dean of one faculty said: “In our
first year the intake was fairly poor;
the second year it improved vastly, but
sank a little in the third. This year we
are getting the cream.”
Professor Jock Marshall, the famous
“one-armed bandit”, when asked at
“The Vicarage” whether Monash was
considered a third - rate university
downed his third pint, grabbed my pen
and wrote: “I have heard that this is
covert talk in the suburbs. I understand
that the reason why a lot of students
choose to go to Melbourne is because
they have a kind of procurator who
goes round the high schools even in
our area telling them of the indispu-
table advantages of Melbourne Univer-
sity education. The fact is that nobody
in their senses would go to Melbourne
in preference to Monash, unless they
wanted a special study course, for ex-
ample, genetics. They talk about it be-
ing the old University with tradition.
It’s an infant. What were my last two
places? St Bart's 1123 and Oxford
1264.”
The Professor holds court at “The
Vicarage” every lunch-time. “The Vicar-
age,” actually, is the Notting Hill Hotel
in Ferntree Gully Road. It is a large,
vulgar, roomy and extremely comfort-
able hotel, and, what is most peculiar
in a Victorian hotel, plenty of places
where you can sit, talk and drink.
Professor Marshall coined that name
“The Vicarage”. He says that Richard
Gordon, author of “The Doctor in the
House”, used to call the pub opposite
St Bartholomew’s “The Vicarage”. It
was a handy term; far better to say one
was dining at “The Vicarage” than,
crudely, having a few at the pub. “So
we borrowed the name,” he said. “Be-
sides, what else could you do? You just
couldn't call the place the Notting Hill
Hotel. After all, look at it.”
“The Vicarage” is quite a place. As
the Union is still not established, and
the cafeteria is only a temporary
affair, “The Vicarage” tends to be the
general meeting place. As “Chaos”, the
student newspaper, puts it, the “caf”
assists “The Vicarage” with the cater-
ing.
So at “The Vicarage” one tends to see
a general mix-up of students, builders’
laborers, lecturers and professors, with
Jock Marshall as the sort of Bishop,
or should one say the Dean of The
Vicarage? New staff get their introduc-
tion here, and there is an inevitable
first-name sort of matinee, which has
done a great deal to set the tone of
Monash.
Originally Monash was meant to be a
breeding ground for scientists and en-
gineers. The first Vice-Chancellor is an
engineer and, of course, the name of the
University was taken from Victoria’s
most famous engineer, Sir John Mo-
nash. So it is one of life’s little ironies
at Monash that the swing has gone
entirely the other way. Here is the
breakdown in faculties: Arts 1270,
Economics and Politics 470, Engineer-
ing 200, Medicine 380, Science 350,
Law 150 and Education 40.
So Arts plus Economics have better
than half the student population, and
it is intriguing to see how the gentlemen
in these faculties believe that’s exactly
the way it should be. They will tell
you the science shortage is a myth.
Already we are producing as many
scientists as we need. If it were not so,
salaries would be higher and lecturers
would be harder to get.
At the University there is an atmos-
phere of concrete-mixers, the smell of
varnish, new carpets, fresh plastic, an
atmosphere of excitement and growth.
This feeling of excitement is a very
genuine thing and, with everything new
and constantly changing, it can be quite
intoxicating.
However, the excitement idea can be
over-used. As a lecturer in Zoology put
it: “This excitement routine sometimes
wears pretty thin.” Monash now has
over 3000 students. By the beginning
of next year it will have 5000. That is,
it will have reached the same level in
four years that took Melbourne Univer-
sity 85. There are critics who say
Monash has grown far too fast with too
little money, and there are those on the
other side who say that but for this
speed of growth all Victoria’s tertiary
education would be in a scandalous
position.
Both sides are right in part. There is
little doubt That Monash has suffered
very close to the danger point from
lack of money. The lack of money is
not evident to the eye. Monash already
has spent over £lO million on buildings
and there is no complaint about them.
They look very good indeed. The com-

These children will play a part in your company’s future
This recently completed high school provides education for the children of
hundreds of families living in the French’s Forest area of Mackellar County. It is
situated on one of the main arterial highways, near a modern shopping centre and
in the heart of a rapidly growing residential area. Through schools like this,
Mackellar County adds another important factor to its promise of space for
industrial growth and expansion. Here is a steadily developing potential work-
force...a workforce what will make your expansion programme a reality. There
are forty seven schools in Mackellar County, educating twenty eight thousand
future citizens...future staff for local industry.
Mackellar County encourages industrial investment.
The industrial areas are only ten miles from the heart of the
city, yet surrounded by unspoiled bushland. Careful inter-
relation of industrial and residential areas close to main
highways, public transport, schools and shopping centres
have put this county years ahead in area development
planning. Mackellar County provides an efficient system of
arterial highways...plenty of space for growth and expansion
...pleasant surroundings for greater plant efficiency...estab-
lished residential areas for both executives and staff.

plaints are over the lack of equipment
inside and the recurring income. The
early years in particular were tough,
when Monash really had to lead a
hand-to-mouth existence. Some depart-
ments were asked for the estimates of
what they needed and then another
schedule, an estimate below which they
they could not survive. Often this was
the cash they received.
The Registrar, Mr Johnson, remem-
bers how it all started. And he says it
was a real problem. “How do you
work out what a new university will
cost?” He sat down with Professor
Brown (Chemistry) and they arranged
some figures. They knew for a start,
definitely, what salaries would cost.
There was an old formula that salaries
were 60 per cent of total university
costs. Therefore the thing to do was
to add 1 /6th for administrative costs,
multiply by 10 over seven and you got
your answer.
“The only trouble was,” he said, “we
forgot to multiply everything by two.
We just didn't reckon on the administra-
ive load of getting things under way.”
Dr Matheson got into a tussle with
Mr Bolte over costs. Mr Bolte said
there should be no complaint. Monash
got the money it asked for. Dr Mathe-
son said last week: “That’s true, we did
get the money we asked for, but the
trouble was we didn’t know. I don’t
think we should ever have been asked.
Our expenses should have been met as
we went along.”
For the current three-year period
1964-65-66 he says they will get two-
thirds of the money for which they est-
imated.
HPhe cash shortages are felt in different
ways. In Zoology the equipment is
new and modern, very attractive to re-
search students. They should have a
professor, 13 full-time academics and 11
research students, but there are only
funds for one professor, 8+ academics
and five research students.
The library has 120,000 books. The
: Librarian, Mr E. H. Clark, and the
j Vice-Chancellor believe that a good uni-
versity library should have at least one
million books. When you realise that
the average cost of a university text-
book is £4 and that it costs another £4
just to catalogue and shelve, then it is
clear that libraries are very expensive
indeed. The cost of many overseas
(periodicals is over £IOO a year. “Inde-
| cus Medicus” from the US, for example,
| costs $350 a year.
Mr Clark says that the poor quality
of Australian libraries is one of the
great tragedies of academic life here.
The only good library in the country,
and that includes State libraries, is the
. Fisher Library at the Sydney Univer-
I sity and that does have one million

books. To build up a nucleus, Monash
should be spending £300,000 a year on
books and periodicals, but it is spend-
ing less than half that.
Professor Ken Hunt, Dean of the
Faculty of Engineering, has a similar
story: good buildings but not enough
equipment and he wonders whether it
wouldn't be better to be all in tents and
have the equipment they need. He says
they will have roughly half their basic
equipment by the end of this triennium.
He doesn't blame the University, the
Bolte Government or the Universities
Commission. - He blames the entire
country’s parsimonious attitude to edu-
cation.
On the other hand, if they are suffer-
ing from money shortages the equip-
ment they do have is all new and very
good and this is a university that has
recruited extraordinarily well. Apart
from the good appointment of the Vice-
Chancellor, they have Donald Cochrane,
former Professor of Commerce at Mel-
bourne University, as Dean of the
Faculty of Economics and Politics. As
Professor of Education there is Richard
Selby Smith, the renowned former head-
master of Scotch College. Professor Joe
Bornstein, Biochemistry, Professor
Archie Mclntyre, Physiology, and Pro-
fessor Marshall all have big reputations.
M iracle-worker
Derham, former Professor of
Jurisprudence at the University of
Melbourne, is another. He started the
Law Faculty only this year and already
he has been something of a miracle-
worker. He resigned from Melbourne
University on February 29 and started at
Monash on March 2. But somebody up
there must like him and I refer to loftier
authorities than Dr Matheson or
Mr Bolte, because he has been very
fortunate. He has won the law libraries
of the late Sir Charles Gavan Duffy and
the recently retired Sir Charles Lowe.
On top of that he has persuaded Frank
Beasley, the founder and former Dean of
the Law Faculty in Perth, to serve for at
least a year as special lecturer.
The young Professor Derham is a
good example of the Monash excite-
ment. He is really pushing ideas. For
one, he is seeking authority to make the
Law course a combination of Law and
Arts. He suggests that after three years
students be eligible for a degree called
Bachelor of Jurisprudence and after
five years LL.B. “My aim,” he said,
“is that all lawyers should be both
pounded with advanced law and EDU-
CATED.”
Despite all the enthusiasm, there is a
basic inferiority complex at the Univer-
sity; a terror of becoming a mere edu-
cation factory. Everybody talks about
this and some of the student publica-
tions feature solemn, heavy, learned
pieces on the function of a university.
So Monash, which already operates in
a suburb famed for light industry, is try-
ing terribly hard to avoid the factory
label. They are moving into new
areas of study. There is a department
of Anthropology and Sociology, some-
thing not possessed by Melbourne.
There are 130 post-graduate students
and they are making real efforts to make
a reputation for research and they are
doing well in subjects like solid state
and low temperature physics, bio-
physics, biochemistry and physiology.
In other ways the place is developing
character. Professor Marshall launched
a policy of planting thousands of Aus-
tralian trees and shrubs around the Uni-
versity. He points out that this will
make an Australian university with a
difference. At the moment if you want
to see a good exhibition of Australian
trees and shrubs you have to go to Cali-
fornia, to Berkeley University or Uni-
versity of California, Los Angeles.
Professor Marshall’s real joy is Snake
Gully. Here he has eight acres right on
the campus by Deakin Hall and fenced
off with a lofty electric fence. Inside
there is a lagoon and a tangle of red
stringy barks and black wattle. There
are wombats, echidnas, scrub turkey,
wallabies, bandicoots and the rare Cape
Barren geese. It's beautiful.
Right here he is conducting some
fascinating experiments with Professor
Douglas Lampard of Electrical Engi-
neering. The echidnas have little trans-
mitters on their bodies. So by using
walkie-talkies and D/F technique they
can not only find out the animals’
temperatures but where they are.
Snake Gully has now been classified
as a B-class Zoo and it is really some-
thing to see. Professor Marshall battled
hard to get the space. There’s a story
that early on he was terrified he would
lose half his area to the residential col-
leges. The bulldozers were advancing,
so one moonless night he hurried up
there and removed all the surveying
pegs. That at least gave him breathing
space.
As I say, Monash is developing char-
acter of its own.


The Mcnash Story —2
Academic Strengths
and Weaknesses
“Where the God-Professor rules ”
By FAWKNER
How is Monash shaping up as a
teaching institution? In its first
two years (this is only its fourth)
it was visually much like a rather flash
Canberra high school. Housed in two-
storey buildings were 700 students, a
considerable proportion of whom were
Melbourne University rejects; perhaps it
was inevitable that the new institution
would be initially regarded by the mass
of matriculants as necessarily inferior.
Even then, however, there seem to
have been quite a few outstanding
characters who came to Monash by
choice. Since then it seems that the
number who give Monash their first pre-
ference has increased considerably
though it is still true that Monash takes
a disproportionate number of students
who just scraped through matriculation.
This is particularly true of the Arts
Faculty, which, lacking Melbourne’s re-
quirement of a foreign language at
matric, attracts generally poorer stu-
dents. Monash Arts also deters good
matriculants through its narrower range
of subjects; Psychology is the most not-
able gap.
The greatest deficiency for Arts stu-
dents is the lack of an efficient, well-
equipped library. Despite the expenditure
of £750,000 on a modern four-storey
building and an annual grant this year
bigger than that of any other Aus-
tralian University, the Monash Library
at the present time provides an abysmal
service. Staff complain that orders for
new books have' taken as long as a
year in processing and students estimate
that at times as many as two thousand
volumes mount up on the “return coun-
ters” waiting to be sorted and returned
to their shelves. Growing pains perhaps,
but damaging all the same.
Despite the fact that Monash was
conceived originally as a technologically-
biased university (though not as biased
as the University of NSW), and the fact
that the Council only agreed to Human-
ities in the first year under the pressure
of the Australian Universities Commis-
sion, Arts are well-housed in a 12-storey
modern building; equipment (language,
laboratories, calculating machines, etc.)
is plentiful and of high standard.
But it is the technical people at
Monash who are really well off for
equipment, relative to Melbourne.
Science, Engineering and Medicine all
offer excellent facilities for both students
and staff. Laboratories and their equip-
ment are brand new and there is far
more bench-space per student than in
the older university. These may be a
factor in attracting a relatively larger
proportion of better matriculants to
Monash. The Arts and Economics and
Politics faculties seem to have lost much
of the advantage they initially had over
Melbourne in staff-student ratios, but
science students can still expect sig-
nificantly more tuition at Monash.
What of the differences in the sub-
jects a student may choose and the effect
on the value of his degree? Many courses
are not yet developed to a stable form
and others are not yet established. There
is as yet no Architecture, Fine Arts,
Music, Psychology, Town Planning, or
Metallurgy. But Monash does have a
number of courses which Melbourne has
not, notably a booming Anthropology
and Sociology Department (with 250
students in its first year), a Faculty of
Economics and Politics (quite different in
its structure from Melbourne's Com-
merce), a large and vigorous Computer
Centre, Agricultural Economics; and a
number of others are in the offing, not-
ably Linguistics and South-east Asian
Studies, and a number of post-graduate
courses in Applied Science and Engineer-
ing.
Within faculties there are considerable
differences too: Economics at Monash
allow greater specialisation, particularly
in Statistics; in Science, too, students
can concentrate earlier on the branch
they wish though, on the other hand,
the Engineering Course defers special-
isation to the post-graduate level, making
little of the traditional distinction be-
tween mechanical, chemical and hyd-
raulic.
Monash staff are remarkably similar
in their background training to staff at
Melbourne. Over 40 per cent have Mel-
bourne University degrees; over 20 per
cent are Englishmen; remarkably few are
from continental Europe or North Ame-
rica (less than 7 per cent) though South
Africans and New Zealanders account
for 10 per cent. Less than a half of the
higher degrees held were awarded by
Australian universities, well over a
quarter are Oxford or Cambridge degrees
while only 15 American degrees are
held.
At least two departments at Monash
are largely composed of younger mem-
bers of staff who welcomed the oppor-
tunity the establishment of Monash of-
fered to get away from old and stodgy
professors at Melbourne. One other
department is almost a complete trans-
plant from a provincial English univer-
sity.
But Monash is by no means all in-
novation. In fact it seems to have devel-
oped very deliberately many of the
deficiencies of other Australian univer-
sities, particularly in organisation. At
Monash the “God-Professor” rules on
high as almost nowhere else. He spends
about 80 per cent of his time on com-
mittees and boards and on administra-
tion; he gets together with his fellow
Gods to appoint new Gods (no outsiders
on professorial selection committees); his
strength alone in the high places deter-
mines the future of his department, he
holds all promotion and reference powers
over his staff hardly a creature to be
tolerated in a self-governing community
of scholars! A recent professorial edict
is a case in point: the Monash Profes-
sorial Board late last year ruled that
promotion beyond Senior Lecturer to
Reader or Associate-Professor would be
reserved for academics of outstanding
scholarship who made a unique contri-
bution in their field. This requirement
is so high as to preclude many academics
from hope of promotion after the age

of about 35, and if persisted with is
likely to lose Monash much teaching
talent to other universities.
Mon a s h Administration seems
thoroughly heavy-handed and restrictive,
too. Promotion procedures are being
hardened along public-service lines;
departmental discretion in offering teach-
ing and also secretarial staff in short
supply that little extra is increasingly
limited. Administration, according to the
student newspaper, is quite obsessed with
rank and status. They report the im-
position of distinctions in all activities
in room sizes, floor coverings, desk-tops;
and they report the disconnection of
telephones of junior staff not as an
economy drive but to establish a gradu-
ation in benefits. Despite the fact that
Monash has a parking area as large as
the total land space at Melbourne Univer-
sity, strict parking regulations have been
instituted. Even a mud-patch which
serves as carpark for the Arts Building
is divided off: red stickers on the God-
Professors cars entitle the ten of them to
occupy a front row some 50 yards long
nearest the building, green stickers allow
the lower orders of staff to crowd out
the cleaners’ cars whose yellow-sticker-
ed vehicles are relegated to an area
covered by high grass and strands of
barbed wire.
But despite the oppression of an over-
bearing bureaucracy and the whims of
God-Professors and the weight of teach-
ing loads, Monash staff and students
do manage considerable extra-curricula
activity.
Producing “Chaos”
Otudent clubs and societies are ex-
tremely active: drama, literature
and film groups hold regular showings;
Newman Society, Jewish Students and
Student Christians are all active; the
students’ fortnightly newspaper “Chaos”
often lives up to its name but on the
whole plays a constructive role; and the
Students’ Representative Council,
though notoriously timid in its dealings
with “the authorities”, is not afraid like
some SRCs to take the initiative in poli-
tical affairs—just recently it sponsored
meetings on Censorship and Soviet Anti-
Semitism.
Sir Robert Menzies, after W'hom the
giant Humanities Building is named,
must have a few followers at Monash
but they are very passive: the Labor
Club is the only active political club.
With a membership of just under 100,
it sponsors lunchtime speakers and oc-
casional seminars, runs a weekly book-
stall, sends small teams of canvassers
out for the ALP at election-time and
co-operates with the Victorian Fabian
Society. So far Monash has no “ban-
the-bomb” or “peace” groups.
Adult education was only started at
Monash this year but the popularity of
the courses offered this year suggests
that there is great potential in this field.
Refresher courses for school teachers are
conducted in the vacations and an in-
creasing number of conventions are held
at this time, too. A number of Monash
staff members indulge in TV and radio
broadcasting though none can claim
to have attained the stature of those
Parkville veterans Norman Harper and
Zelman Cowan.
Dr lan Turner in the History Depart-
ment, newly arrived from the ANU in
Canberra, co-edits together with com-
munists Rex Mortimer of “The Guar-
dian” and Geoff “Somewhat to the Left”
Sharp of Melbourne University Social
Studies Department the new popular-
front intellectual journal “Arena”. Of
another color is the burgeoning Gaitskel-
lite journal “Dissent”, which has a leg in
at Monash as well; two of its editors,
Leon Glezer and Peter Samuel and a
number of its advisory board teach in
the Economics and Politics Faculty.
Several Monash staff have been active
in the Freedom to Read Committee form-
ed after the banning of “The Group”
notably Professor Munro (Philosophy)
and Dr Orr (Politics). Professor Legge
(History) is president of the Institute of
International Affairs.
So it appears that the problems of a
suburban university can be overcome as
long as its special problems of student
housing and transport are recognised. A
large new Students’ Union building is
nearing completion and this, together
with soon-to-be-started sporting facilities
and a Great Hall, should remedy a num-
ber of present deficiencies. If adminis-
trative rigidity can be shaken off and
the quality of staffing maintained the
future is promising, though the pre-
sent fear is that the development of
Melbourne’s third university may be
aliowed to divert money away from
Monash, aggravating many of its dif-
ficulties.
But it is the students who deserve
the last word. As the good-natured
Vice-Chancellor Dr J. A. L. Matheson
commented of them in a backhanded
way after a visit to Bangkok University
(among other places) last year: “The
(Bangkok) undergraduates were polite,
uniformed, clean and diligent; they did
not throw their lunch-wrappings on the
ground. They bore no resemblance
whatever to the Australian under-
graduate. To my lasting regret I just
missed the ceremony which every Aus-
tralian academic surely would love to
see in his own university at which stud-
ents paid homage to their professors”.


OUT AND ABOUT
The Laughing Yogi
"It also helps if one has suffered ”
By JAN SMITH
important thing,” Sir Paul
I Dukes declared, “is to choose
one’s parents, which of course
we can't do.” Although it was
clearly one’s duty to give a docile
yes, it almost seemed as if Sir Paul,
window-shopping in some astral exist-
ence, had proved himself the exception
in selecting an English country parson.
From the moment Sir Paul confessed
his origins, and his adherence to the
best tradition of parson's sons in run-
ning away from an overly-religious home,
everything seemed easier. It was tough,
of course, being asked to define intan-
gibles like time, body and soul on an
empty stomach, and to be told that one
didn't theoretically exist, but by con-
stantly reminding oneself that the ques-
tions were, so to speak, congenital, it
was possible to feel a little less like Alice
in Wonderland.
At 75, with barely a trace of grey, Sir
Paul not only incessantly stands on his
head, along with Lady Dukes, but has
convinced thousands of people, in every
continent except South America, that it
is right and conductive to longer, health-
ier living. As a top yogi of the
Western world, his followers, he says,
include members of the armed forces
(British and Indian), film stars, cabinet
ministers and a member of the Royal
Family.
Sir Paul has written “The Yoga of
Health”, “Youth and Joy”, (68 illustra-
tions), and a commentary for Lady
Dukes’s “Relax and Grow Younger - ’.
“Keep Young and Healthy”, 14 yoga
exercises set to music composed and
played by the author is available as an
HMV LP record for home study.
To a dilettante yogi, already exposed
to Sir Paul's theories at the Union
Theatre lecture earlier in the week, his
four-point rejuvenation plan of elimina-
tion, alimentation (eating and drinking),
respiration and relaxation was fairly
familiar.
We should laugh whenever possible,
Sir Paul had advised, exercising his
muscles in silent mirth at the completion
of each plough stand. And we must
never, never apologise for yawning—
another natural exercise for toning up
the face and lungs.
With the body cleaned out and pro-
perly refuelled “it's just like redecor-
ating a house, you have to clean out all
the junk first” there was hope for
almost anyone wishing to embark on a
healthier, rejuvenated middle age.
“Eat foods that have matured in the
sun,” Sir Paul had advised his audience,
and on the table before us, splendidly
bathed in afternoon radiance, was a lush
basket of fruit in season. “That’s why we
call this the solar plexus, you know,”
Sir Paul explained, patting his tummy.
“The sun is the centre of our cosmos
and the generator of the Life Force.”
Somewhere a light was dawning about
the old navel-contemplation jokes, but
Sir Paul, deaf to all such levity, went on
to deliver heavy reproofs about Sydney,
where he had uncovered a certain
amount of yogistic heresy As in America,
too many people had seized on yoga as
just another passport to fashionable
slimness, learning from unqualified
teachers who had themselves learnt
from dubious sources.
“I believe there’s actually one woman
who does yoga on television,” Sir Paul
confessed. “It’s quite impossible, because
yoga is such an individual thing, and
the exercises are only the very last part
of yoga.” The purely gymnastic approach
could lead to serious physical harm.
“People of your age,” sair Sir Paul,
“would be much better advised to take
up water-skiing or sailing.
“It is only in the lower schools,” said
Sir Paul, “that one finds strict rules
about what yoga is and isn't.” The very
best yogis, who taught Sir Paul in
St Petersburg and later in India, had
absolutely no rules at all. The first step
was to make the mind a complete blank
and concentrate on one's inner needs.
“It’s no use at all wishing for a million
dollars,” Sir Paul explained in his best
lecturer’s voice, “because a million dol-
lars is something outside oneself. Seek
courage, fortitude, peace of mind, and
maybe the million dollars will follow.’’
In any case, a million dollars would
do no good, because it would change
one overnight into a different person,
fecklessly squandering money and head-
ed for ultimate moral disintegration. Use
less to counter that one knew people
with a million dollars who w-ere no more
disintegrated than anyone else. “What is
self?” cried Sir Paul. “Are you the same
person you were ten minutes ago? Is
anyone?”
Imagining the young Paul Dukes,
whisked from the podium to a top po-
sition in British Intelligence, the differ-
ence was obvious. In those First World
War days, as a music student who hap-
pened to speak fluent Russian, he was
Britain's key man in St Petersburg,
ferreting out information and being hid-
den by loyal friends in graveyards while
the revolutionary hordes rampaged
above him. Already experimenting with

yoga, he found the breathing methods
invaluable for keeping hidden in a small
space without food and water.
He was knighted in 1920 for espion-
age work in Russia and between the wars
was special correspondent for “The
London Times” in Eastern Europe, tak-
ing occasional time off to visit Indian
yogis and to keep his hand in conducting
Balkan orchestras. Sir Paul’s last con-
cert was in Bucharest in 1935, and by
1939, almost fully committed to yoga,
he was doing a survey of British cen-
tenarians to study the causes of their
longevity.
Sir Paul visited Australia first in
1958, accompanied by Mrs. Diana Fitz-
gerald, for a series of lectures with Mrs.
Fitzgerald as demonstrator. They shared
a common background, Mrs. Fitzgerald
having lived in India before working
for British Intelligence, and in 1960 they
were married.
Could yoga, as many prominent
Sydneysiders had sworn, stop colds?
“Certainly,” said Sir Paul. “It’s all a
matter of breathing properly, as most
people, including yourself, are undoub-
tedly not.” How to cope with stuffy
buses crammed with sneezing passen-
gers? An experienced yogi like Sir Paul,
well versed in entombments, simply puts
mind over matter.
Art of breathing
“T\o you know what your lungs even
look like? Your bronchial tubes?”
Sir Paul persisted. “We breathe 21,000
times a day, you know, and when did
you last breathe properly?” Five minutes
before bed simply wasn’t good enough.
“I could teach you to breathe,” Sir Paul
offered, “but you’d have to come along
in slacks, and of ~'uirse I'd have to exa-
mine your nostri.s. ’ In all, it was an art
that might take several years, no mere
trifle like a headstand, which anyone,
said Sir Paul, could accomplish in five
minutes.
Attention to breathing, eating and re-
laxing was far more important, but here
again there were no hard and fast rules.
There was no need to be a vegetarian
(Sir Paul is not), but meat, having been
deprived of the Life Force when the
animal was killed, was at the bottom of
the list, the proletarian as opposed to
the “aristocratic foods” like fruit, veget-
ables and cereals. The best thing about
animals, Sir Paul said, was the milk,
eggs and honey they produced. “But we
must treat our animals kindly, and love
them, to get the best results,” he said
Here again everything had to be
worked out according to the individual.
“Yoga diets, health diets, slimming
diets,” Sir Paul sniffed. “As if anyone
could say what was best for anyone
else.” He believed, however, that most
people didn’t drink enough to refurbish
the body, which was largely composed
of water. “Water and tea, water and
coffee, anything as long as it’s water.
Even water and barley, and water and
hops. The sun shines on them all, you
know.”
Water with fluoride was a social pro-
blem Sir Paul was not concerned with.
Neither is he concerned with how his
followers treat major diseases like
arthritis, rheumatism and heart troubles,
providing they are in reasonable health
before they take up yoga. Yoga itself was
excellent for fixing more day-to-day ail-
ments, like poor digestion, poor circula-
tion and elimination, and postural aches
and pains. The main requirement, for
people of a riper age, was that they be
relatively unossified. “It also helps,” Sir
Paul added, “if one has suffered.”
Mentally or physically it didn’t matter,
since they were two sides of the same
thing. “Have you ever suffered anything
that didn’t affect you both ways?” Sir
Paul asked.
“Of course I can do amazing things,”
Sir Paul said in answer to a question
about beds of nails and levitation. “Like
fasting for weeks once when I was
younger. Hungry? Of course I got
hungry, but wasn't it worth it? To give
one’s body a chance to springclean it-
self?” For most people, he feels a one-
day fast is sufficient, every few months,
the body being helped along with
copious drinks of water, or water and
additives.
To prove his abhorrence of dogma-
tism, Sir Paul occasionally lights up a
cigarette “just when there’s some
solemn people watching who need a
shock, but not for any personal enjoy-
ment because I can't bear the taste.”
He does not, however, plan any big
shocks for Sydney in his four weeks
here unless the announcement that
Shakespeare was a yogi surprises any-
one. “Nothing is either good or bad but
thinking makes it so,” Sir Paul quoted
on parting, “and you can’t get much
closer to yoga than that.”


THE ADVANTAGES OF ALUMINIUM No. 3

Strong, light, bright! Aluminium cooks quickly, evenly.
‘Hot Spots' occur in cooking utensils made of
metals with poor heat conductivity. The heat
from the stove ‘stays put’ instead of spreading.
The result? Burnt food. But aluminium spreads
heat smoothly and evenly makes cooking
easier and quicker. The same high conductivity
(combined with lightness and resistance to cor-
rosion) is the reason why the sole-plate of the
modern iron is made from aluminium.
The high heat conductivity of aluminium means
that it also cools with remarkable speed an
advantage in many applications. In the motor
car, aluminium brake drums speedily dissipate
the heat of friction, preventing dangerous brake
fading. Similarly, aluminium engine blocks mean
cooler running and higher performance. Jet
engines, air-conditioners and refrigerators are all
made more efficient by the ability of aluminium
to shed heat quickly.
In electronic applications, aluminium ‘heat sinks'
or ‘heat exchangers' are employed special
aluminium shapes which either dissipate exces-
sive heat or transfer it to points where it is
needed. Paradoxically, aluminium reflects heat—
as it does light. It also conducts electricity and
is non-magnetic, non-toxic, and impact absorbing.
It is less costly than other non-ferrous metals,
and is available in every form known to the
metal-working industry. Aluminium has a wider
range of finishes than any other metal, providing
virtually any colour or texture. Aluminium is
truly the metal of the Twentieth Century.
Now, Alcoa of Australia (with its 49% Australian
shareholding) mines, manufactures and markets
aluminium in an enterprise that spans our nation.

ater, water everywhere and
not a drop to drink!” For
* v five years this has been the
lament of the thousand souls that make
up the population of Gardner and Hull
Islands. The Phoenix Islands, part of
the Gilbert and Ellice Group, lie just
below the Equator. The two most
southern islands are Gardner and Hull,
little more than atolls just a circle of
coral reef with an inland lagoon. You
can walk across any part of these
islands in a few minutes, and the inha-
bitants live in closely settled villages.
Their homes are made from coconut
leaves, firmly woven for the walls and
plaited for the angled sloping roofs.
The men spend their days fishing, and
the women tending the homes, cooking
and gossiping a typical South Sea
Island life.
After five years of virtually no rain,
the coconut palms have drooped and
yellowed, the banana trees become life-
less, and the soil reverted to sand. During
those five years the Gilbertese had relied
mainly on coconut milk and the
occasional shipment of water, with some
food, from the British Government. But
unloading supplies was a difficult task
under the best conditions. There are no
harbors and no wharves, and the land
drops vertically into the sea right round
the coastlines these islands being
possibly the top lip of extinct volcanic
mountains. At Gardner Island the depth
of water is so great that no ship can drop
anchor, while at Hull the only anchorage
is close in, approximately 250 feet from
the shore, so can be used only in the
calmest weather.
Finally the British Government decided
to evacuate the two parched islands, and
Wagina Island in the Solomons was
chosen as the new home for the 1000
natives on Gardner and Hull. But Wagina
was a virgin island, covered with jungle,
so an advance party of workers set out
and, under the guidance of British
Government experts, the jungle was
pushed back and communal homes built
for immediate occupation until villages
could be planned. All was now 7 ready
for the mass migration.
From Tonga came the MS Niuvaki
on charter to the Gilbert and Ellice
Islands Colony. Built in Germany in
1959, the Niuvaki is a sturdy little ship
of 2600 tons, designed to withstand the
Baltic Sea's icy conditions. She has been
bought by the Tongan Government to
transport coconuts from Tonga to Pan-
gopango where a new desiccated coconut
factory is being built. Until this factory
opens late this year, the Niuvaki is
available for charter. Her Captain, lan
Fraser, Chief Officer, Frank Wales, and
Chief Engineer, Hans Mose, are all
young men, but with a wealth of ex-
perience in charting a course and sailing
among the reefs of Pacific coral islands.
Their Tongan crew comes from a long
line of experienced seamen, who can
adapt themselves to any circumstances
and conditions, with the stamina of the
famed ‘'Minerva Reef” men.
As the Niuvaki approached Gardner
Island, anticipation rose on both island
and ship. Here was a ship virtually on
a mission of mercy. Ashore the people’s
excitement ran high. They were shortly
to be re-united with husbands and sons
who had left to prepare a new home for
them on Wagina, a home where water
would no longer be a problem, food
could be grown in abundance, and life
would be so much easier.
Unable to anchor, the Niuvaki
cruised up and down in the deep water
just off shore. She hove-to while the
ship’s launch was lowered and wooden
work boats were towed in a line behind.
Never before had such a large ship been
seen in these waters, and cries of —-
“Kamime, kamime!” (beautiful, beautiful)
drifted across the water.
With 1000 people, plus their belong-
ings, to be transhipped approximately
1000 miles, it would be necessary for
the Niuvaki to make two trips, and so
the first 450 passengers waited.
No livestock was to be taken, as it
would not survive in the very different
climate of the Solomons, but two enter-
prising natives, determined to take their
pets with them, smuggled two dogs,
firmly tied in sacks, aboard one of the
small boats. But as the loaded boats
made their way back to the ship, some
were caught in the swirling current at
the entrance through the reef, and cap-
sized. In the general melee the two
hapless dogs sank from sight.
As the first string of boats arrived at
the ship, a further problem presented
itself. Many of the women and children,
having lived on a completely flat island
with houses built flush v/ith the ground,

had never been faced with climbing steps
of any description. The gangway looked
a terrifying thing to them, and as the
ship rose and fell in the gentle swell, a
deadly thing. Men swarmed up and
down to show the women how it was
done, and finally one, braver than the
rest, jumped for the gangway. She
clambered up two or three rungs, but
suddenly slithered, screaming, back into
the boat. For some time chaos reigned
—it looked as if the problem of getting
the women aboard would never be solved!
But gradually confidence grew and the
women progressed up the gangway on all
fours, to the accompaniment of much
laughter and shouted advice from those
below. Their arrival on deck produced
its own complication as the women were
very reluctant to regain an upright
position, feeling quite unsafe at such a
height from the water. Then there was
further panic when these nervous natives
found they had now to go down to the
deck below. This seemed strange beyond
all reason—to climb up to a ship and
then to go down again. But the wonder
of it all soon overcame their fears, and
there were more cries of “Kamime,
kamime!”
Wonderful experience
As they were to travel as deck pas-
sengers, the after-hatch had been pre-
pared with tarpaulin coverings on top,
and an opening left for passengers bedded
down inside the hatch. Soon mats were
spread and belongings neatly laid out.
Each family had its own allotted space,
and right throughout the six days of the
trip this was their home where nobody
encroached without invitation. Water-
bottles were still their most prized
possessions as it seemed impossible that
there would ever be a time when water-
bottles were not needed. What little
food the passengers had managed to
bring with them was supplemented by
food provided for the trip, and as the
Niuvaki got under way cooks were
the first people called for. There was
plenty of rice. Now the very serious
business of deciding among themselves
who was best at cooking rice, and so
could produce the best possible meal
began. All communal w'ork on the island
had previously been decided by long
discussions, the simplest decision often
taking half a day to reach. It was with
some dismay that they found shipboard
life so different. Now the burning
question of’who would cook the rice had
to be decided within a matter of minutes!
Finally Working parties for all jobs were
sorted out to everyone’s satisfaction, and
the passengers settled down to enjoy this
new and wonderful experience.
The happy Gilbertese w'ere given the
run of the ship with the exception of
the officers’ quarters, and never once was
this privilege abused. On a sheltered

part of the deck tarpaulins were rigged
to make primitive, but effective, toilet
arrangements.
Very early on the first morning out,
the second engineer noticed an excited
gaggle of women clustered outside the
hospital door, and wandered over to
investigate. To his horror he found one
of the women about to give birth. He
roared for the doctor, the hospital was
hastily opened, the doctor arrived at the
run —and the baby was born —it all
seemed to happen on one movement!
The new arrival was named Miss Niuvaki,
and everyone was exceedingly happy.
As the morning wore on the line of
people outside the hospital seemed to
grow unusually long. Undoubtedly they
were very pleased about the new arrival
—but, a lot more pleased to be able to
stand and press the water faucet and see
water pour out like magic. Hans Mose
decided it was time to organise things!
The line of chattering Gilbertese were
guided towards his cabin, and as each
one entered was allowed to switch the
light on and off once, amid cries of
“Kamime, kamime”, then to press the
water faucet over his basin, and move
on. Hans Mose made one mistake though
•—he playfully sprayed some after-shave
lotion on one of the laughing girls, and
finished the trip completely devoid of
after-shave lotion!
“Good boy”
children were shy to start with, but
always ready with a great big smile
if spoken to. One young man of eight
became very daring and actually said
“hello” to Hans Mose. A halting con-
versation in English followed, whereby
they exchanged names and ages. Finally
the small boy stood silent for some time,
obviously wrestling with memories of his
English Instruction Book. Suddenly his
face broke into a beaming smile as he
triumphantly announced “You are a
good boy.” The Chief Engineer solemnly
repaid the compliment.
Throughout the trip the officers were
impressed more and more with the way
their passengers lived together. Although
in cramped quarters under conditions
which needed patience and tolerance all
round, there was no dissension. Every-
one was eager to help the next person,
and work parties were organised with
enthusiasm and without argument.
The Gilbertese are a naturally friendly
and happy race, with a great love of
music. They would spend hours on deck
with guitars and ukeleles, singing in
perfect harmony. The only complaint
from the Captain and First Mate was
that the most favored spot for this past-
time—day and night—was right outside
their portholes!
At last land was sighted, and for a
whole day and night the Niuvaki sailed
down the coastline of Choiseul Island.

This amazed the passengers greatly, as
never before had they even imagined that
an island could stretch so far. At the
foot of Choiseul lies Wagina, the
islanders’ new home where it is hoped
they will help to build up the copra trade
and integrate with the Solomon Islanders
on Choiseul.
It was early in the morning when the
Niuvaki finally dropped anchor close in-
shore at Wagina. There were no beaches
again to land on, and now came the
most difficult part of the whole operation.
The loaded boats were towed to the
narrow mouth of a creek where coral
rocks jutted up on both sides, leaving a
tiny entrance through which the water
raced. With just enough room for the
boats to squeeze through, it took perfect
seamanship to negotiate the narrow
channel. Fortunately all went well and
the passengers were off-loaded on a small
beach in the calm waters of the creek.
It would be difficult to judge the
feelings of these Gilbertese as they
stepped ashore for the first time on their
new island home. They were dazed by
the magnitude of the land masses they
had sailed past, awed by the mountains
and the giant trees they had seen. They
had just come from what was now a
desert island to the lush growth of a
rain forest. The jungle, where snakes
would be encountered, non-poisonous but
nevertheless terrifying to their eyes,
pressed close. Mosquitoes, fortunately
■not malaria carrying, but something else
to contend with, bred in thousands.
Crocodiles would oe a real danger, and
the Gilbertese had to learn to live in a
humid climate, so different from their
previous hot dry climate. These natives
would need to learn an entirely different
way to fish, and' the food they would
grow was as yet quite foreign to them.
But the joy of reunion with the working
parties, their awed delight with the big
communal homes, probably outweighed
any misgivings they may have felt for
the future. But as the first boatload
scrambled overboard they were soon
stopped in their tracks. Here was some-
thing strange and sticky, that oozed
between the toes and clung to their bare
feet. It was some time before they
came to terms with their first encounter
with mud!
For two days the unloading continued
until the passengers were finally settled
ashore with all their belongings, and the
Niuvaki set course for the Phoenix
Islands again.
The money-makers
second trip took them first to Hull
A Island where they were able to drop
anchor about 200 feet from the shore,
on the edge of the coral reef. Here
followed again a busy two days of load-
ing, then on to Canton Island where they
picked up Gilbertese who had been work-
ing for the British and Americans. There
was a certain amount of consternation
when these moneyed Gilbertese were
unable to ship 14 cars!
From Canton Island the Niuvaki
sailed to Tarawa, the Administrative
Centre for the Gilbert and Ellice Islands,
where one of the biggest American-
Japanese actions were fought in the
Pacific. A grim reminder was a 450-
pound unexploded bomb dug up recently
when the ground map for the radio
station was being installed.
With a call, too, at Ocean Island, the
second trip took nine days in all, noted
mainly for two incidents that occurred
at Hull Island on the last day of loading.
One of the native women found the
excitement too great and gave birth to a
premature baby on the beach. This tiny
mortal weighed only one pound eight
ounces. The doctor was quickly
summoned from the ship and the baby
gently wrapped in sterile dressings. Both
mother and baby spent the night in the
ship’s hospital and on arrival at Canton
Island next day, transferred to the Ameri-
can Airforce Hospital, w'here an incubator
had been installed a few days previously.
The American doctor was very pleased
to be able to try it out so quickly, and
mother and baby are doing well.
As the final loading was being com-
pleted, Captain Fraser stood on deck
gazing at the scene before him. Apart
from the small activity on the beach, not
a thing moved on the island. All live-
stock had been disposed of, most of the
coconut palms stood like dead sentinels,
their leafy tops, long since withered, had
snapped off with their own dead weight,
while those that still survived drooped
wearily, their leaves withered and
yellowed. The banana trees stood stripped
of all foliage, the ground was barren and
hard, and the houses, so recently teeming
with life, stood deserted and desolate.
This was the death of an island. Then
slowly and majestically, a great mass of
black clouds moved in from the sea to
engulf the island, and as the Niuvaki
sailed for the last time from these
parched islands the rains came!

A summary of learned opinion
By CELLARMASTER
"Decently it was my pleasure to enjoy
a tasting of maturing red wines.
These wines had been bought over a
period of time that extends back eighteen
months or so, and it was felt the time
had come to test their progress.
The tasting was attended by gifted
amateurs in the game of wine, a couple
of sober professionals, and a confusion
of eager novices. No less than four
show judges were among them, three of
them interstate. So that no one opinion
could influence another at time of tasting,
everyone was asked to record their
remarks, for elaboration and discussion
afterwards. Since the experts’ learned
opinions are worth much, I thought a
summary of this discussion could prove
interesting and instructive, together with
some particular comments. Of the 25
wines tasted, I have selected about half
to avoid too much repetition . . .
McWilliams’ Pinot Hermitage 1959.
Soft, round, light burgundy style with
good flavor and bouquet. Will still
develop character and flavor. Keep to
improve, though drinkable now.
Penfold’s McGill Dry Red Bin 244
1956. Slight bouquet but excellent flavor.
Little harsh acid at finish but overall
good character. Will not improve, but
should hold up for quite a while.
Coonawarra Estate Cabernet Sauvi-
gnon 1957. Excellent style wine of great
promise. Bright color, good nose and
flavor; a tone of life in this wine, far
too much tannin for drinking now, will
improve for years and years. “A superb
wine, far too good for the Barbarians!”
Mildara Bin 20 Cabernet Shiraz 1957.
A big wine, a bit deficient in flavor. Well-
balanced tannin, but opinions were
divided regarding its future. All agreed
it will keep, but some wondered if it will
improve. I shall keep a little for interest.
Lindeman’s Bin 1950 Burgundy 1960.
Nice character and flavor, soft and well-
balanced. Quite ready for drinking, may
not improve but will hold up for a long
while yet. “Very easy on the gums.”
Tintara C 24 Cabernet 1957. Con-
sidered by some to be the best wine on
the table. Great flavor, loads of tannin,
not to be drunk now. “Keep, keep, keep.”
Reynella Claret 1957, St Patrice
bottling. Bought quite cheaply when
young, has developed into a very smooth,
well-balanced wine, full of flavor with a
pleasant, fruity taste. Very good wine
for general palates; “would please mixed
company at dinner”. No need to keep.
Penfold’s 798 Dry Red 1957. Nose,
flavor and finish combine well to present
a well-balanced claret. Clean on palate,
with very pleasant aftertaste. “Shows
development of their table wines.”
Glenloth Cabernet 1957. Good quality
claret, soft on palate but with quite
astringent finish. Good for drinking now,
and although it could improve a little,
probably near peak.
Lindeman’s Burgundy 984 1957.
Bigger than the previous wine from the
same firm and much less ready to drink.
Will keep for years and could improve
considerably. “Good wine for cheese”.
Saltrams Shiraz 1957. Buring’s bottling.
Classic Barossa shiraz developing very
well. Little too big and gutsy for some.
Must keep. “Looking forward to develop-
ment of this excellent tasting wine”.
Tintara CIII Cabernet 1959. Excellent
Coonawarra blend showing great style
and character. Good flavor and balance,
but needs more time to be at its best.
Considered among the best of those pre-
sent with one lone, dissenting “far too
hard!”
McWilliams’ Richard Hermitage 1958.
Very good light style, close to peak. A
little heavier than the ’s9s from the
Hunter, showing evidence of bottle age
with pleasant mature flavor.
Well, I’m afraid the above may be too
much like a catalogue for some, but,
since the original purpose of this column
was to point out the best of what is
currently available, I make no apologies.
Of course, this is only a summary of
what we tasted and is in no way supposed
to be completely representative. This
week I have drunk a 1960 Rouge
Homme, a 1961 Tyrell, a 1956 Buring,
and a 1955 Yalumba claret found stand-
ing upright on a shop shelf, all of which
were excellent.
The conclusion of which, I suppose, is
that I drink too much! But then, as
Brillat-Savarin pointed out, “The dis-
covery of a wine is of greater moment
than the discovery of a constellation.
The universe is too full of stars.”


OVERSEAS
1. Confrontation—Two
Points of View
Not “Crush Malaysia ” but “Crush Britain "
By ZAINU’DDIN
(Mr Zainu’ddin is a Melbourne University Final Year Arts student from Indonesia)
Why then is Indonesia opposed to
the Malaysia project? To be
able to understand Indonesia’s
position, we need to look at the history
of her struggle for independence and
thereafter the struggle for maintaining
peace and order within the country;
her foreign policies which are largely
affected by her experiences during the
struggle; and her views on military and
political developments in Asia.
The Indonesians achieved their inde-
pendence through fighting and the sacri-
fice of lives and property. It is natural
that the Indonesians are very jealous of
their hard-won independence, and that
they look suspiciously at any foreign
bases in their neighborhood. After in-
dependence, domestic revolts were assis-
ted by foreigners with the tacit consent
of their governments, e.g. the Dutch
helped the Ambonese and the Darul
Islam revolts, while those in Sumatra
and North Celebes also received foreign
support in the form of weapons. Singa-
pore and Malaya were used as sanctua-
ries and recruiting places by the rebels
without any hindrance from the govern-
ments there. Singapore was the haven
for smugglers from Indonesia.
In foreign affairs, Indonesia adopts an
independent policy, rejecting any mili-
tary pact with other countries. The basis
of this policy stems from the nationalistic
consideration that the struggle between
Communism and liberal Democracy
does not concern Indonesia; from the
consideration that by not joining either
of the two camps the area of con-
flict might be reduced. In this way Indo-
nesia hopes to contribute something to
world peace. This policy, however, does
not apply to the fight against colonialism
in whatever form it might be.
i n Asia, watching the industrial pro-
gress made by the Chinese Communists,
the advance of Communism in South
East Asia, realising how little the West-
ern Powers can do to stop the advance
in that region, the question of relin-
quishing foreign bases in South East
Asia became more urgent. (Western mili-
tary bases are the main targets of Com-
munist attack). The reason for the Indo-
nesian anxiety about the British base in
Singapore is now twofold. Firstly, partly
the purpose of the British base in Singa-
pore is to keep an eye on Indonesia,
President Soekarno recently announced
that he had a British document in his
possession indicating this intention,
Secondly, President Soekarno and other
leaders are worried that the successful
Communist advance southwards will en-
courage the powerful PKI to revolt
against the government. In 1957 Presi-
dent Soekarno introduced Manipol Usdek
ideology with the idea of combating
liberalism and Communism. (He believes
ideas should be combated by ideas, not
by weapons). He certainly does not like
his scheme wrecked by the presence of
the British base in Singapore.
How does Indonesia view the Malay-
sia project? To the Indonesians it is not
just an orderly de-colonializing project,
it is a neo-colonialist project. The argu-
ment, that one of the main purposes of
including Sarawak and Sabah into Mal-
aysia is to offset the big majority of
Chinese in Singapore, so that the total
number of Malays will be greater than
the total number of Chinese, is doubtful.
One report on the economic aspects of
Malaysia by Mr Jaques Rueff quoted by
L. F. de Gidro (Bulletin, December 7,
1963, p. 38) gives the figures for “Popu-
lation by Ethnic Groups” 1961) for all
Malaysia as follows:
Chinese .. .. 4,302,000 42.2%
Malays .. .. 3,991,000 39.2%
Indians and
Pakistanis .. 995,000 9.4%
Non-Malay
Indigenous 716,000 7.0%
Non-indigenous 223,000 2.2%
If these figures are accurate, it is clear
that there are more Chinese than Malays
in Malaysia. Even if the number of
Malays is higher than the number of the
Chinese, the Chinese still are in a better
position because economically they are
much stronger. The aim of the project
is to control the former colonies, which
are now formed into Malaysia, through
native government. Britain still controls
the economy of the country. Britain will
still have her military base in Singapore,
although officially it is stated that the
base will be there only temporarily.
This is, of course, very doubtful, be-
cause, for one thing, financially the
country will benefit from the presence of
the British base in Singapore. Secondly,
even if the government of the country in
which the base is situated, wants to re-
linquish it, the foreign power will suc-
cessfully resist it if the base is strategi-
cally very important to the foreign
power, e.g. Japan and Cuba.
From the Indonesian point of view
the Malaysia question is a matter of great
concern. To them “Crush Malaysia”
policy does not mean abolishing Malay-
sia as a country, but crushing the British
concept of Malaysia. This has been re-
peatedly said by various Indonesian
government spokesmen.
Maphilindo
President Soekarno has tried to solve
the problem several times, but Britain
and others have sabotaged his efforts. In
May, 1963, President Soekarno invited
the Tunku to Tokyo to have a talk. This
talk seemed to be successful and led to
the meeting between the Foreign Minis-
ters of Malaya, Philippines and Indo-
nesia in June 1963 in Manila, and finally
to the talks between the Tunku, Presi-
dent Soekarno and President Macapagal
in Manila in August 1963, which produ-
ced the Maphilindo ideas. One of the
things agreed on August sth is that there
should be a fresh investigation of the
wishes of the people in Sabah and Sara-
wak. The letter of the three Heads of


Governments to U Thant says that this
should take into consideration:
1. The recent elections in Sabah and
Sarawak.
2. The wishes of those who being quali-
fied to vote, would have exercised
their right of self-determination in
the recent elections had it not been
for political offences or absence
from Sabah and Sarawak.
However, the UN investigation was
wrecked. The Philippines and Indonesia
complained that their observers were not
given visas until it was too late. People
who should have been asked their
opinion about Malaysia were not ques-
tioned. The date for the official forma-
tion of Malaysia had been fixed prior to
the obtaining of the result of the investi-
gation. The British were not the only
people who wanted to wreck the Maphi-
lindo agreement. They got support from
Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore, Donald
Stephen from Sabah, and Stephen Ning-
kan from Sarawak. The reason why
Donald Stephen and Stephen Ningkan
were annoyed was mainly that they were
not consulted, and probably they felt
Indonesia had no right to mix with
Malaysian affairs.
Opposition
TJowever, for the British and the
A Chinese capitalists in Malaya and
Singapore the reasons were more basic.
In their views if the Maphilindo ideas
were working well, Indonesia would be-
come the dominant country amongst the
three Maphilindo partners. Indonesia is
not what one can call friendly towards
foreign as well as domestic capitalists,
especially Chinese. Furthermore, if there
were some clash of interests between the
Malays and the Chinese in Malaya the
Malays could get support relatively
easily from the Indonesians, since they
would now be partners. Reasons for the
British opposition to Maphilindo can be
made clear by quoting some of the
points agreed to in Manila between the
three heads of Governments:
1. The three nations, as new emerging
forces in the region, shall combine
their efforts in the common struggle
against colonialism and imperialism
in all their forms and manifestations
and for the eradication of the ves-
tiges thereof in the region.
2. The three heads of Government ag-
reed that foreign bases —temporary
in nature —should not be allowed to
be used directly or indirectly to sub-
vert the national independence of
any of the three countries. In ac-
cordance with the principle enun-
ciated in the Bandung Declaration
the three countries will abstain from
the use of arrangements of collective
defence to serve the particular in-
terest of any of the big powers.
In conclusion, I would say that any
analysis which lays the main stress on
internal economic and political difficul-
ties in Indonesia is inadequate, even
though Indonesian (and Malaysian) in-
ternal problems are relevant. There is
reason to believe that the successful
working of Maphilindo ideas is not ac-
ceptable to Britain nor to some powerful
interests in Malaysia. In the Indonesian
view a solution of the Malaysian prob-
lem as envisaged in the Maphilindo con-
cept is not only the most satisfactory
solution, but also vital to Indonesia’s
future.
2. A Time to Stop
Aggression?
Malaysia as an anti-Communist state...
By D. G. M. JACKSON
/\ur Government has now committed
Australia to full support of Malay-
sia. We are to send a small body of
troops to aid in the defence of the
Borneo states at once; and if Soekarno’s
confrontation continues or is stepped up
our aid will be increased, too, as the
means to furnish it grow.
Is the commitment an unwise one, for
a country which as we have been
told must learn to live side by side
with emerging Asia by way of peaceful
adjustment?
Ought we not at least to have waited
on the final decisions of Washington,
where they still hesitate to break with
Djakarta, lest Soekarno be forced into
the arms of the Communists?
In the end we are reminded our
Government decided not to go all out in
backing the Dutch plan for West Papua
and accepted the Indonesian takeover
in West New Guinea, which marches
with our own ferritories.
Why should we take a different line in
the case of Malaysian Borneo, which is
farther away and has concerned us little
up till now?
To answer these queries, we must
recall the last bout with Soekarno and
the contrast between its conditions and
those now obtaining.
For the Dutch, West New Guinea
was the last remnant of their valuable
lost Empire, representing a heavy eco-
nomic burden and little more.
They clung to it on principle insisting
that the Indonesians’ claim was legally
unfounded and without ethnic basis and
that they were incapable of fulfilling its
people’s needs or aspirations to true
self-rule.
They hoped vainly to gain
American and UN support for their
enlightened scheme to create a free
West Papua: and Australia shared that
hope, some of our politicians looking
towards a united “Melanesia” as the
ultimate objective, in close alliance with
the Commonwealth.
But the plan could not be carried out
because Soekarno would not allow the
Indonesian claim to remain in cold
storage in the United Nations: and after
his victory in the Sumatra-Celebes re-
volt made it clear that he would take no
denial.
His armed strength had become for-
midable largely through Soviet aid: and
the Dutch could not hope to stand
against it without full support from the
USA as well as Australia.
Washington refused to endorse West
Papua, however: in the Afro-Asian bloc
in the United Nations, the Africans
were generally uninterested in the dis-
pute and the Asians backed Soekarno.
So, in the end, the Dutch retired after
a gallant show of resistance, under
cover of a negotiated agreement media-
ted by the Americans.
The Australians had neither the

means nor the will to support them
alone even if they had been willing to
hold out further.
The ALP denunciations of the be-
trayal of the Papuans were unmeaning
since they had no plan for maintaining
their cause in the only way it could be
maintained by armed force backing
a strong diplomacy.
Soekarno therefore obtained his will
and immediately made it clear that the
terms of the agreement providing for
a Papuan plebiscite would not be carried
out and that he regarded the takeover
as a simple victory of emergent Indo-
nesia over colonialism.
So far as Australia was concerned the
humiliation of being ignored in the ne-
gotiations and discussions was the price
paid for weakness.
idea that Soekarno might be satis-
fied by the concession of “Indonesia
Irredenta” in West Irian and the re-
moval of the Dutch pressure in the
region was dispelled even before the
agreement was actually concluded, by
the Indonesian backed brush fire war in
Brunei which opened the offensive
against the British colonialists and the
Malaysia scheme.
We are frequently told that Soekarno
is not much like Hitler. He is a gay,
charming fellow with an unquenchable
thirst for women which some commen-
tators seem to find humanly endearing.
He has panache and enjoys strong ges-
tures, but is not really bloody minded
or ruthless and he is neither a racialist
nor a Moslem persecutor.
In one respect, however, he certainly
resembles the late Fuehrer. For he is
an extravagant man, whose expanding
plans for a greater Indonesia are in-
compatible with any sort of peace and
stability in this region of the world, and
who cannot be pinned down to observe
any agreement limiting these vast and
vague designs.
And he resembles Hitler and some
other modern demagogues in re-
garding himself as the mystical oracle
of his people's destiny and of their
sovereign will, which he identifies with
his own will to power.
His diplomacy is a Protean system of
illusions and contradictions deliberately
designed to bewilder and confound those
who deal with him. as he moves color-
fully forward amid a mist of verbiage.
Setting aside the evasive quicksilver,
and chameleon-like color changes, how-
ever, I believe we have a clear indication
of Soekarno’s real aims in a statement
made by him in 1945 to the Body for
the Investigation of Indonesian Inde-
pendence at a time when the Japanese,
with whom he collaborated zealously,
were still occupying the Indias.
In opposition to the more moderate
Mahommed Hatta, he insisted that Indo-

nesia must embrace Malaya and all
New Guinea with the surrounding
islands, as well as the British Borneo
states and Portuguese Timor.
Properly speaking, he reflected, it
should also include the Philippines if it
were not already a sovereign state.
It had nothing to do with the Dutch
East Indies and its boundaries. He had
never, he said, in 25 years of fighting
imperialism accepted those boundaries
as the true limit of Indonesia.
In view of his insistence on Borneo
plebiscites, incidentally, it is worth
noticing that at that time he was ready
to maintain that Malaya desired to be
integrated with Indonesia on the basis
of a handful of letters and telegrams
and the appeal of a delegation of young
men!
It looks as if this equivalent of the
Napoleonic French Empire were now
generally accepted
by the political and
military leaders of
Indonesia. The idea
that a full - scale
plebiscite held under
UN auspices would
deter these men
from continuing
confrontation seems
to be sheer wishful
thinking as well
as the possible in-
fluence of cooler
heads on Soekarno
himself.
What he really
thinks about ple-
biscites when the
demand for them
cannot be used for
trouble - making
he has shown in the
case of West New
Guinea.
In Mai ays i a n
Borneo the will of the people has been
tested by the Cobbold Commission, by
U Thant's agent and by the 1963 elec-
tions, whose character and results were
confirmed by a UN survey, which en-
dorsed their results as a true reflection
of overwhelming public opinion in favor
of Malaysia.
If the British had wished to rig the
polls in Borneo they would certainly
have brought pressure on oil-rich
Brunei whose adherence would have
been so useful to Malaysia and whose
abstention has been so awkward.
In all the discussions held since con-
frontation began, nothing about the
terms demanded by Indonesia has been
clear except that British troops must be
removed from Borneo at once, so as to
make the Malaysian states helpless in
face of Indonesian armed power.
The indications are, however, that if
this were conceded, Azahari of Brunei
would be sent in to form an independent
North Kalimantan which would be a
satellite of Djakarta.
Thereafter Malaya, reduced to politi-
cal confusion and communal conflict in
the hour of defeat could also be liberat-
ed as a dependency of Indonesia, pend-
ing absorption when a staged revolution
had destroyed the existing establishment
completely.
In Singapore the downfall of Lee
Kuan Yew would pave the way for a
new order collaborating with Peking—a
sort of Cuba in the Indian Ocean.
What would this crushing of Malaysia
really mean to Australian security? The
debacle of the British and their allies
would produce a powerful new shock to
Western influence throughout Asia and
Africa and might well decide the United
States Government
to accept Lippman’s
view that the whole
effort of military
cont ainment in
South East Asia
ought to be aban-
doned.
And can we imag-
ine that Soekarno
having destroyed a
sovereign state re-
cognised by the
United Nations
would stay his hands
at our own colonial
border and that
we should not have
to fight v a bitter
guerrilla war in New
Guinea very soon
against new “libera-
tors” in alliance with
tribal insurgents?
In a word Malay-
sia is an indispen-
sable part of the Western containment
pattern in East Asia, essential to our
present security, in view of the revolu-
tionary, militant and expansionist
character of the two greatest states in
this region.
If it crumbles, and the future conse-
quences I have foreseen ensue, as seems
most probable, Australia will be an ill-
defended and vulnerable outpost of the
West lying, in isolation, south of an
Orient dominated by a Peking-Djakarta
anti-Western axis.
How power will be divided between
these partners is clear enough. Soekarno
will have the island world and Malaya
embraced in a Maphilindo under the
managerial direction of Djakarta: the
mainland of the South-East peninsula
will be the position of the Chinese
Communists.


Breaking Up the
Commonwealth?
Southern Rhodesia’s lan Smith plays hard to get
From COLIN LEGUM in London
The long-threatened Commonwealth
showdown over Southern Rhodesia
is now set for July 8-15. The only
point still in doubt is whether Prince
Hamlet Mr lan Smith, Southern
Rhodesia's new Prime Minister will
attend the meeting of Commonwealth
Prime Ministers in London where the
issue will be thrashed out.
Mr. Smith is behaving like a prima
donna in his approach to the conference.
He wants to be invited. But he does not
want to take the initiative in asking for
an invitation, because he does not wish
to appear to be coming cap in hand as
a “new boy - ’ asking to be included in
the party. Also, he fears a rebuff.
If the Commonwealth had anything
as formal as a constitution, a prior
request from Mr Smith would be a con-
stitutional requirement. In the absence of
rules, it is an unwritten convention that
before each Commonwealth meeting the
Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia
should formally indicate a desire to be
invited.
This is a necessary formality to main-
tain the distinction between independent
members of the Commonwealth and its
non-independent members. In fact, only
independent members have a right to
attend. The self-governing territory of
Southern Rhodesia is treated as an
exceptional case.
Originally, the exception was made
not for Southern Rhodesia but specifi-
cally for its then Prime Minister, Sir
Godfrey Huggins (now Lord Malvern).
The reason prompting this courtesy was
that Sir Godfrey had the longest un-
broken premiership in the Common-
wealth. But it was made clear at the
time, and ever since, that the invitation
is “by courtesy - ’ of the Commonwealth
Prime Ministers. This courtesy needs to
be renewed with each conference.
There was no Commonwealth meeting
so long as Mr Winston Field was Premier
of Southern Rhodesia, so the question
did not arise in his case. All that is
required of Mr Smith is that he should
indicate his wish to be invited.
Britain cannot of herself decide the
question of invitations. Convention-
ally, this is decided by a consensus of
opinion among Commonwealth Prime
Ministers. They do not all have to agree.
The situation only becomes difficult if
one member is rigidly opposed.
It would be surprising if an invita-
tion were refused to Mr Smith to attend
at least that part of the conference which
will deal with his country’s affairs. Most
Commonwealth Prime Ministers, includ-
ing the African members, would undoub-
tedly welcome the opportunity of con-
fronting Mr Smith personally.
Sir Alec Douglas-Home has surprised
people by seeming to suggest that Com-
monwealth Prime Ministers have shown
a desire to discuss “the internal affairs”
of Southern Rhodesia. The point is that
the British Government itself formally
decided in 1963, as a matter of old
policy, to involve the Commonwealth in
trying to reach a solution for Southern
Rhodesia. This was one of the reasons
for Sir Alec’s visiting Nigeria’s Prime
Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa,
last March.
Fears have been expressed in some
quarters of the Commonwealth that
Southern Rhodesia might cause the
break-up of the Commonwealth. This
view has been publicly stated by Trini-
dad’s normally cautious Prime Minister,
Dr Eric Williams. The anxiety is felt not
only in the non-white parts of the Com-
monwealth. It was first openly expressed
in an official report of the views of a
committee of experts who reviewed the
Commonwealth’s future at a conference
convened by the Commonwealth Rela-
tions Office last year.
Britain is herself strongly condemna-
tory of white supremacy governments in
Africa. Moreover, her declared policy
for Southern Rhodesia is that it should
achieve a representative democratic con-
stitution within five years. This means
a transfer of power to the African
majority. Mr Smith’s government stub-
bornly rejects this policy. So a deep gulf
has opened up between the two govern-
ments.
But the gulf is equally deep between
the Southern Rhodesian Government and
its two immediate African neighbors,
Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia, both
of which become independent this year
the former in July, the latter in
October.
These two countries forced the liquida-
tion of the Central African Federation
on the grounds that it entrenched govern-
ment in white hands. Having achieved
their own freedom they feel it their duty
not to abandon their African brethren
in Southern Rhodesia to white minority
rule. This attitude is shared by all the
African members of the Commonwealth,
as well as by the Asian and West Indian
members.
But the older members of the Com-
monwealth are equally concerned. Aus-
tralia, New Zealand and Canada all
supported Britain’s decision to press for
majority rule as a prerequisite to
Southern Rhodesia’s independence. They
fear that if this were not done the Com-
monwealth would be thrown into a
similar crisis as occurred over South
Africa in 1961. That crisis was over-
come only by Dr Verwoerd’s decision
to withdraw from the Commonwealth.
These are the ingredients of the crisis
which cause many Commonwealth
leaders to take the view that Southern
Rhodesia's affairs touch directly on the
future relations within the Common-
wealth, and that if these deteriorate the
Commonwealth itself would be placed
in jeopardy, (ofns.)

Gallipoli Without Anzac
For London , not Australia
By PETER HASTINGS
Project 64. TCN-9. Sydney.
T ast week's Project 64 on Channel 9
—Bob Raymond’s Gallipoli was
both fascinating and disappointing. Per-
haps advance publicity or inbred chauvi-
nism led many to expect that the
documentary would not only be about
Gallipoli, which was a unique and heroic
military campaign, but that it would also
be about Anzac, which was to become
a unique and heroic event in Australian
history. At all events Anzac was very
deliberately played down and it was
curious to note that in an hour-long
programme, while quite a bit of time
was given to interviews with two Tur-
kish officers who served at Gallipoli
(and a lot of time to the interesting but
largely irrelevant post-war career of
Ataturk), not a single Australian soldier
was interviewed, although in incongruous
fashion Sid Nolan, the painter, was.
Mr Nolan explained that in his paint-
ings he has tried to interpret Anzac as
part of the Australian legend. This was
interesting but irrelevant, and also
slightly promotional as well. Lord Slim
was a lot nearer home, for he is greatly
respected in this country as a man and
as a soldier. But although a survivor of
the bloody Lone Pine battle he is not
an Australian either. In fact the only
living Australian soldier who appeared
in the film was Trumpet Major Tom
Joseph, whose halting introduction to
the programme was simply unfortunate.
Compiled in haste and under pres-
sure, parts of the documentary were
quite unforgettable. There was tremen-
dous visual impact just in seeing actual
contemporary film of The Narrows,
Anzac Cove, distant Samothrace, a line
of wind-blown pines, a scrub-covered
but still traversable trench. All of this
gave one, perhaps for the first time,
some notion of the sheer physical con-
striction of a narrow peninsula where
two great armies fought only a few
yards apart for nine months.
Mr Raymond did equally well with
some antique moving film showing
Abdul the Damned riding portiy to
prayers in a Mosque; an unexpectedly
trim and smiling Kaiser on a visit to Con-
stantinople; the sour, contained face of
Liman von Sanders; Kitchener moving
down a defile with a jaunty confidence
he could scarcely have felt; Birdwood
looking tall and impassive and Hamilton
frail and anxious. Best of all were
glimpses of the Kemal of 1915, an intent
and brooding man, the victor of Gallipoli.
There were other fine things which Mr
Raymond dredged up from archives and
museums—stills of landings, wounded
men, a blindfolded Turkish officer seek-
ing armistice to bury Turkish dead, a
Digger with a pipe on a chain, a be-
spectacled soldier with a periscope rifle.
T)erhaps the most agreeable surprise of
A the documentary was Alan Moore-
head in a heavy sweater, the Aegean
wind blowing through his hair, explain-
ing precisely a subject he knows very
well. He described the campaign, point-
ing to fortifications and battlefields, to
the unpleasant terrain, to the cliffs and
to the narrow murderous beaches, as he
stood on the heights of Chunuk Bair
where, for a brief period, a very few
once viewed The Narrows for which
hundreds of thousands of men fought.
And yet the documentary might have
been a great deal more if Mr Raymond
had, with the same detachment with
which he treated the campaign, done
something to show Australia at war.
There were no films of recruiting scenes,
only one of departing soldiers, none of
returning ones, none of politicians or of
people; there was not even a single still
of Billy Hughes.
There was no real indication of the
feelings and emotions taking place in a
distant and isolated Australia apart from
a few shots of contemporary advertise-
ments which implied that business was
being conducted pretty much as usual.
As if that were all. Mr Raymond’s
Gallipoli will undoubtedly be a success
if it is ever shown in London, but as
treatment of a part of Australian history
it missed.
THEATRE
Ballet
The Australian Way
Swan Lake (Fonteyn, Nureyev); Jazz
Spectrum, Divertissements, Aurora’s
Wedding (Gorham, Jones, Nureyev,
Welch). —The Australian Ballet,
Elizabethan Theatre, Sydney.
VTo doubt the variety of plain and
fancy in-fighting with which Syd-
ney’s critics and public have greeted the
Fonteyn-Nureyev season with the Aus-
tralian Ballet has injected some lusty life
into our theatre, but it has obscured
some pretty important items.
Not enough has been said of the qual-
ity of the company itself, and since a
deal of public money has been invested
in the Australian Ballet some report is
justified. In my view the news is good.
Since last year, Miss Van Praagh and
Mr Ray Powell have succeeded in creat-
ing a fine and flexible instrument, with
a most competent corps de ballet and
an interesting, reliable group of soloists.
More than this, in Miss Kathleen
Gorham we have a ballerina of the finest
quality—it has to be said, so I might as
well say it early, that at this present
date Miss Gorham is dancing better than
Miss Margot Fonteyn—surer attack,
cleaner technique, and with that fire
which seems to elude Miss Fonteyn. The
company’s other ballerina, Miss Marilyn
Jones, while not quite of this standard,
is demonstrably a much better dancer
than the other imported star, Miss Lupe
Serrano.
The principal male dancers of the
group, Mr Garth Welch. Mr Bryan Law-
rence and Mr Karl Welander do not
have that balloon, that muscular projec-
tion which makes Nureyev and Russian
dancers generally able to make the air
seem their natural world. What they do
have, however, is quite enough person-
ality and star quality to capture and ex-
cite great audiences—demonstrated most
tellingly to everyone but the claque in
the programme of divertissements.
As you may by now have divined. I
am not much impressed by the Trust’s

notion of importing highly-touted and
highly-paid stars to this company. I
am especially not impressed when our
own ballerinas show with embarrassing
clarity on the same stage that they are
better than the imports.
Within our own ranks we have enough
star quality; all it needs is to be built
up and sold to the public. In Miss
Jones we have a dancer of great physi-
cal beauty, and one who is putting back
into ballet that great essential (lacking
altogether in British ballet) —sex appeal.
This sensual communication of Miss
Jones is a marvel on stage—and I am
sure that the Trust’s very able publicity
staff could build this young dancer, with
the fire of Miss Gorham, the gallantry
of Mr Welch, and the fine comedy of
Mr Karl Welander into a public image
that would draw tremendous houses.
Far better than the great expenses of
being involved with overseas concert
managements, the Trust would be better
advised to spend a little money on really
building our own stars —and importing,
if not available here, some front-rank
choreographers to work permanently
with this exciting and vigorous young
company.
The time has come to say a long good-
bye to classical ballets; “Swan Lake”,
“Aurora’s Wedding” and “Giselle” should
be shuffled off. If the Trust wants mass
audiences for ballet here, then it has to
get after the youngsters born since 1937,
who, by and large, have little knowledge
(and less love) of classic style.
Betty Pounder’s new ballet, “Jazz
Spectrum'’, performed in the third p ro .
gramme of the Sydney season, is the
sort of production that points a new
way. Its remarkable decor (by John
Truscott) of plastic tube
vaguely echoing a molecule model, with
dissolving light coming through plastic
screens, sets off a whole pattern of
rhythms and movements of modern life,
Melbourne jazz pianist, Les Patching
has written some entrancing music in hii
score—the lyrical cool jazz of “Refe
tions”, an episode superbly danced bt
Mr Garth Welch and Miss Marilyt
Jones, completely carrying the^audience
Younger audiences will take this type
of dancing to them as their own, and
if the Trust could put Mr Nureyevinto
a surf ballet the company ought to Is
able to play for years. The movement
patterns of society change very quickly
and surely; the classic style took Australi:
by storm before the war with the di
Basil companies—but what is wank;
now to capture new markets and auft
ences is a pulse of new feeling, some
thing that will capture the activity o:
modern Australian life.
As to performances, apart fro;
policy, you will—if you wish to k
nostalgic about the old days—get son
satisfaction from “Swan Lake”, in whie
Nureyev displays a fine touch for tl
lyric, and in which Miss Fonteyn dance
very well in the English style.
“Aurora’s Wedding” is turned oi
very handsomely by the company, ar
Miss Kathleen Gorham displays a fieri
perfection of technique and a fire whic-
I think you will agree on seeing it, tab
her beyond any ballerina we have see:
here in recent years, with the exceptior
perhaps, of some of the Bolshoi soli
ists.

growing up around the show. Bernard
Smith at the opening suggested, more
realistically, a Dionysiac Festival. One
hears talk of the competition eventually
extending beyond Australia and New
1 Zealand. But the real drive behind the
whole affair is that Gallery Director
Ernst van Hattum keeps on worrying
I the main question: Are we getting better
and better sculpture?
Undoubtedly on the evidence of this
show we are getting better sculpture,
i The work of the senior sculptors
5 Klippel, Redpath, Jomantas, King,
Walker, Parr is more imposing and
more confident. The middle range is
.steadier, or at least less given to playing
games with materials. And there are a
lew good newcomers.
For the second time the main prize
of £4OO went to Norma Redpath for
her polished, soaring bronze “Dawn
Sentinel". The more sedate, beautifully
balanced “Guardant” of Vincas Joman-
tas took a £5OO acquisitive prize. In
4he section for small sculpture the £lOO
prize went to a pair of works by Robert
Klippel.
Probably these prizes could have been
picked on paper beforehand. Redpath
and Klippel have recently established
sculpture in its proper place with two
splendid exhibitions. Jomantas exhibits
much less but must always be held in
high regard for his exacting finish and
rigid standards. With these out the
show would not be very strong. Inge
King, Lenton Parr, Stephen Walker,
Clifford Last, Alex Leckie, the young
Adelaide sculptor Geoffrey Sharpies,
and a handful of others would still give
it weight (the first three particularly),
but it must be remembered that these
are about a dozen out of more than 50
entrants. It is hard to avoid remarking
the gulf which separates these from the
rest.
I do not agree with those who say we
have no first rate sculptors. While it is
true that we do not have a strong tra-
dition or a lively contemporary move-
ment in sculpture, there are nonetheless
jworks produced here which are satisfy-
ing artistically.
The fact is that most of our best
(Sculpture is abstract. Norma Redpath’s
certainly draw on Nature, and they seem
to me to have gained meaning by being
placed in the open in Mildura. “Dawn
Sentinel' arouses echoes in the land-
scape. Jomantas, Klippel and King on
the other hand are formal sculptors
I and few of the others in this exhibition
give any hint of a style that might be
called Australian either formally or
figuratively. We certainly have no equi-
|alent in sculpture to Nolan, Tucker or
Drysdale.

T>eter Kaiser interestingly confronts
A us with two extremes of paintings—
involved textural and hard-edge abstrac-
tion. Of the former, control and accident
seemed neatly fused. If a comparison is
made between the monochrome rep-
resentatives of this style in this and the
previous show, the river is, as it were,
running dry. Having realised this,
Kaiser takes a sharp turn into the crisp,
rainbow shrill chromatics of targets,
vertical and diagonal bands and the
refuge of the bordered rectangle. The
color is stark but overlapped or adjusted
to yield sensations of space. This partly
overcomes the insistent boredom of
what, to say the least, is banal archi-
tecture. Kaiser, in the midst of an artistic
crisis, is to be commended for not trying
to cover up; the outcome should be
worth watching.
Peter Freeman, a young painter from
England, has no such qualms as he plots
his course between the twin beacons of
Sickert and the Expressionists to come
up with a personal vision of reality
worthy of both. Tonal but painterly
landscapes, sensuously composed, flair
up into colorful vistas of vineyards, trees
or fairgrounds.
Donald Friend as a witty sculptor is
quite difficult to imagine until one is
faced with his latest probe into space.
Copper is deployed with skill, dipped in
acid, cut into silhouettes and riveted.
The punched type follows and a score of
classic horses, heroes and riders take
shape. In the “Trojan Florse” the con-
cept is entirely 3D as the mob surges
out aggressively from an archaic Braque-
ish horse.
Against this exuberance, Mitty Lee
Brown's abstract paintings remain dis-
creetly reticent. Deeply related to land-
scape, their concern for colour subtlety
has a distinctly European flavor. The
moods appear at first sight roughly
similar but they are not, except where a
theme has been developed.
The Dominion Galleries, showing a
second group of paintings from 1900 to
1960, completes a wide historical survey.
Highlights of the collection include
Streeton's “Morning Mist”, a fine essay
into the poetics of Whistler, two close-
toned nocturnes by E. Phillips Fox and
others by Nerli, Gruner and Wakelin.
A strong element of Futurism enlivens
Frank Hinder’s “Subway Escalator'’.
The distinction between craft and art
is nowhere more indistinct than in the
superb collection of antiques, painting
and sculpture at David Jones’ sumptu-
ously redecorated gallery. Vuillard, Ep-
stein and Rodin are matched by nameless
workers in wrought iron, in wood, glass,
jade or porcelain spanning a score of
centuries from a dozen countries.
Whether classic, primitive, Inroque or
Eastern, the communion of fine art is
universal.

A Great Achievement
“Essentially Australian ”
By J. J. AUCHMUTY
(Professor of History, Newcastle University College)
The Modern World: A History of Our
Time. Volume I. From early Euro-
pean expansion to the outbreak of
World War 11. Gordon Green-
wood. Angus & Robertson. 635.
is a great intellectual achieve-
-*• ment. Within the confines of a
single volume Professor Greenwood has
attempted to compress the history of
those world forces which in our own
day and time have most significance for
Australians. It is an essentially Aus-
tralian point of view. It is the attempt
of a single scholar to encompass the tide
of modern history and so to filter it as
to present a readable story for con-
scientious students of world affairs. It
is by no means a finished work of art
for it is set on uncertain foundations
and, since a further volume is in pros-
pect, comes to no definite conclusions,
presents no overall summary.
Nevertheless, though there is respect
for the liberality and the humanity of
the scholarship, admiration for the
depth and skill of the research involved,’
the volume is difficult to place as a con-
tribution either to History or to Letters.
Obviously working on so large a canvas
any scholar is open to criticism as to his
principles of choice, and on only one
point would I like to press this issue.
Rightly and properly in this modern
world, so rapidly becoming one world,
due place is given to accounts of the
background, civilization and modern
history of India, China and Japan. It is
this stress on Asian history, so essen-
tial to Australia, which sharply differen-
tiates this volume from comparative
volumes of essentially American pro-
venance where survey books of this
type have a ready collegiate sale. But
in the process of preparing readers for
an Afro-Asian world, almost the entire
history of Latin America has been
overlooked, presumably quite deliber-
ately.
This is a decision which, especially
in the first of two volumes on contem-
porary history, it is difficult to under-
stand. With the vast growth of United
Nations membership, the Latin Ameri-
can states are of much less influence
internationally today than they were in
the days of the League of Nations but
in the years under survey in this volume
their influence on the world was at
times decisive and in any case, as our
near neighbors across the Pacific, they
are deserving of attention for narrowly
Australian reasons.
Again, regarding the world from a
distinctly Australian point of view, it
is interesting how relatively unimportant
Professor Greenwood seems to consider
the British Commonwealth of Nations.
Canada appears to have made no con-
tribution to the modern world, yet it is
surely clear that the informal rather
than the formal discussions between
Commonwealth nations, if difficult to
document, nevertheless play a vital part
in developing individual Commonwealth
attitudes. In fact there are times when
the book seems curiously old-fashioned,
when one feels that Afro-Asian collars
and cuffs have been attached to a
European shirt.
In a sense Professor Greenwood ad-
A mits in his preface to an old-
fashioned point of view when he asserts
that the focus of his book is in the
broadest sense political, since he believes
that almost all forms of human activity,
whether cultural, religious or social, ulti-
mately emerge at the political level.
Although I do not agree with this point
of view, it is perfectly legitimate for
Professor Greenwood to hold it, but it
leads him into some very odd situations.
Who would anticipate, unless he was
very Australian, that there would be
greater stress paid to the development
of sport in France than to the develop-
ment of French culture and literature?
A very similar situation holds for the
United States but might not raise so
many eyebrows.
Professor Greenwood is very well
aware of the significance of cultural
history. He has some eighty-eight well
chosen illustrations depicting the “Di-
versity of Human Experience” which
include photographs of dramatists and
poets, authors and scientists, actresses,
composers and economists, the great
majority of whom are not mentioned in
the text at all. This brings us to another
and serious criticism. Too often the
text is only fully comprehensible to
those who already have some knowledge
of the subject. Writing on such a scale
it is inevitable that some characters,
temporarily world-famous, should re-
ceive but the barest mention, but as in
the photographs they are often briefly
introduced without comment and then
consigned to oblivion.
In these circumstances it is difficult to
see for whom the book is specifically
designed. In those areas where I pos-
sess any special knowledge the chapters
are well informed, the philosophy of
mind displayed and the firmness of
judgment entirely acceptable. I can
only presume that equal approval can
be given to the other chapters; but they
are neither sufficiently detailed for the
serious student nor sufficiently general
for the average intelligent reader. There
are times when one feels the chapters
to be a succession of excellent lectures
in a general survey course, but ever re-
quiring additional recommendation as to
reading and further study.
Professor Greenwood presents vary-
ing degrees of mastery over his sources.
There are times when there would seem
to be too much direct quotation as at-
tempts are made to summarize vast
periods of the historical past in order
to set the scene for contemporary deve-
lopments especially in the non-European
world, but the survey chapters on Euro-
pean expansion and on international
relations and genera] world trends are
generally good, whilst the section on
Russian developments between the
world wars is quite outstanding. Spain
is given a position commensurate not
with the weakness of that former im-
perial power but rather with the sharp
divisions its tangled politics created in
European intellectual life. The bias of
the author is clearly anti-authoritarian
but since he has a special interest in
what was formerly colonial history this
bias inevitably ensures that those nations
with whom he is most closely attuned
intellectually do not escape without
criticism when the democratic theory
at home is contrasted with authoritarian
practice abroad. The chapters on India
are very fairly written and give a sym-
pathetic picture of Indian leadership
both in theory and practice.
This is a work of considerable length,
approaching 800 pages of not over-large
print and accordingly difficult to read
in one session or series of sessions. It
is emblematic of an age when size is
often admired for its own sake, but it
does attempt a task which is too little
attempted today that of encompas-
sing within reasonable limits a picture
of the background of our contemporary
civilization. In this task Professor
Greenwood has been largely successful
and even though every reviewer, writing
out of specialized knowledge, were to
find specific criticisms that would still
not gainsay admiration at the extent of
Professor Greenwood's courage and
achievement nor deny the value to any
student of world affairs of a reading of
this majestic volume. The author has
been fortunate both in his publishers
and his printers. The book is merci-
fully free from misprints or inaccura

Is This Your Life?
Australian Short Stories: Second
Series. Ed. Brian James. World’s
Classics. Oxford University Press.
13s.
Tn the introduction to his selection of
Australian short stories by twen-
tieth-century writers, Brian James insists
that his claims depend on an implicit “in
my opinion”. It is not surprising that the
contents of “Australian Short Stories:
Second Series” have a close family like-
ness, representing a particular time, a
particular climate of opinion, a particular
view of what short stories are. Broadly,
these are stories which “tell a story” and
display little appetite for either psycho-
logical exploration or extension of the
possibilities of language.
James’s selection reaches down toward
the middlebrow plains rather than up
into a more rarified air. More than any-
thing else, he sets out to represent The
Bulletin short story of the 1940 s and
early 19505. To my mind, this was a
period when The Bulletin’s poetry was
admirably varied and adventurous, but
its stories depressingly bounden within a
narrow range. The narrowness is repro-
duced in this mustering, which looks
oddly partisan for the dignified impri-
matur of the “World’s Classics” series. It
is depressing that readers can find here
none of the more interesting writers who
have appeared since 1950: there is no-
thing of Cowan, Porter, Davies, White,
Shrubb or Thelma Forshaw, to throw in
a fistful of disparate names.
Old modes are well in evidence. Jack
Lusby offers the oral yarn, Katharine
Susannah Prichard the rough slab of
protest, Gavin Casey the heavy piece of
on-the-job documentation, Xavier Her-
bert the shapeless stretch of outback
narrative and Dal Stivens the Aesop-
Thurber fragment. Best of the numerous
outdoor tales are Olaf Ruhen's “The
Wisdom of Ragos”, functional and poin-
ted all the way, and “Old Heinrich and
the Lambing Ewe”, which exemplifies the
late E. O. Schlunke’s steady fidelity to
rural fact and natural rhythm.
One can admire here the frail delicacy
of David Campbell’s sketch of childhood
games and, at the other extreme, the be-
jewelled Regency playfulness of an ex-
tract from Ethel Anderson's “At Parra-
matta”. But the collection as a whole has
ll curiously alien air: for their relevance
t° a life I recognize, most of these
stories might have been written in Uru-
guay. They are peopled by oddly neutral
beings without religious aspirations or
sexual complexities, beings who do not
appear to vote at elections or join
organisations, to read or go to the pic-
tures or listen to music. In short the
simplifications here are all too often the
simplifications of that stock, foreshorten-
ed figure, the Natural Man.
Rather than continue carping for
Brian James and I must have few sym-
pathies in common —I want to cite one
excellent story that bobs up in this selec-
tion. The story is called “The Wasteland”
and it is by Frank Dalby Davison. Set
in the brigalow country with a small
grazier for narrator, it looks orthodox
enough, and its opening could hardly be
more matter-of-fact: “Lot 32, comprising
438 acres —and known among us as de
Burgh’s block —had been forfeited and
was available for re-selection.”
It soon becomes clear, however, that
Davison’s story is concerned with the
inner, reflective life and that this concern
is not to be thrown glaringly up against
mere “background”: inner and outer fact,
reflection and environmental detail, are
inseparable. Two men are in different
ways engaged with a variegated land-
scape and the details of this landscape
continuously illuminate the attitudes of
these men. Davison’s prose is alert; the
story is not a whit longer or shorter
than it should be; the art-form wholly
contains and expresses its matter. Read-
ing a work like this, we no longer feel
the need to apologise for the short story
as a poor relation to ambitious litera-
ture.

Not So Fast,
Miss Barrett
The Trial of Stephen Ward. Ludovic
Kennedy. Gollancz. 345. 9d.
PASCAL makes the point that judges
have to wear robes and other para-
phernalia. Otherwise it would be seen
how inadequately they embody, in their
person, words and thoughts, the majesty
of Law. Never have I been more
aware of the truth of this observation
than when reading Mr Ludovic Ken-
nedy’s careful, considered and unflag-
gingly interesting account of the Ward
trial. The judicial processes on this
occasion appear shabby, fraudulent,
foolish and often contemptible. At the
time, the Ward trial was so much bound
up with the whole bizarre Profumo
affair that one failed to react fully to
its subtler shades. It is only now, when
the dust of the political scandal has
settled, that one realises, thanks to Mr
Kennedy, its full enormity.
When Mr Pickwick and his friends


get involved with a rowdy crowd, Mr
Winkle is seen to take oft his coat and
begin belaboring a small boy. Pre-
cisely the same thing happened in the
Profumo affair. A Prime Minister had
displayed almost inconceivable naivete
and ineptitude; law officers had made
idiots of themselves; a Secretary of State
had believe it or not slept with a
call-girl, and told the House of Com-
mons a lie about it; a Noble Lord had
countenanced curious frolics in his
ancestral mansion, and, even more
heinous, entertained a Soviet naval
attache there, Other, even more sinister,
rumors freely circulated about equally
eminent personages, if not more so.
Confronted with this sizzling, teeming
cauldron, what did the Law do? It
turned all its enforcement reserves on to
getting Ward, the most foolish and
defenceless figure of the lot.
Some hundreds of girls of dubious
reputation interrogated, often for long
periods and at unreasonable hours.
(Miss Keeler, for instance, was interro-
gated 24 times.) Top police officers
occupied for months on end. Prepos-
terous trumped-up charges and proce-
dures used to keep one girl Mandy
Rice-Davies from going abroad, and
to bully others into compliancy. And
the yield of all this mighty effort? The
vacillating, fluctuating “evidence” of
some of the most wretched prostitutes
ever to lift up their heads and voices
in a court of law. A police effort on
such a scale might have been justified
in some tremendous espionage case on
which national survival seemed to hang.
One could understand it where there
was a Jack the Ripper who desperately
needed to be laid low. But to get
Ward? To prove Ward a ponce, which
he clearly was not, or that he lived a
dissolute and squalid life, which was
obvious from the beginning? That
makes no sense at all, except on the
assumption that Ward was chosen to
be a scapegoat, and that his prosecution
was intended to be diversionary. Who,
one wonders, instructed the police to
lay aside activities like tracking down
criminals and concentrate on convicting
Ward of a crime living on the im-
moral earnings of prostitutes he had
evidently not committed? How many
man-hours were dedicated to this pur-
suit? How many millions of words re-
corded and spoken? What did it cost
the State in time and money to lay
Ward low?
How pitifully meagre was the result
is made abundantly clear in Mr Ken-
nedy's narrative. Not one of the pro-
secution witnesses emerged as even con-
ceivably reliable. Christine Keeler is
doing time for perjury. And the poor,
dingy street-walkers who whip gentle-
men inclined that way at a pound a
stroke, or stamp over them in high-
heeled shoes; who engage in “four-
somes”, or other combinations and per-
mutations, as and when required; and
who necessarily live under the shadow
of police displeasure, particularly since
their nocturnal prowlings have been
made illegal what they were induced
to whisper and stutter in court (“Not so
fast, Miss Barrett, please, my Lord is
taking a note”) was about as relevant
to the matter in hand as one of Sir Wil-
liam Haley’s leading articles. From time
to time, in the cross-examination, one
gets a quite uniquely authentic whiff of
the lives of these witnesses invoked to
cleanse the body-politic of the Profumo
slur. Take the following exchanges
with Frances Brown, who lived and
hunted with Vicky Barrett. One of
their clients . . .
“. . . gave us a few drinks, and
then Vicky Barrett did business with
him.”
A long pause.
“Were you present in the room to-
gether?”
“Yes.”
Another pause.
“You saw it?”
“Yes.”
“What, if anything, did you do?”
A small pause this time, but it
seemed like eternity.
“I helped.”
Mr Kennedy's judgment is that the
case against Ward “was by any stand-
ards a feeble one”, consisting mainly “of
uncorroborated statements by proven
liars”, a “tale of immoralities rather
than crimes”. The only witnesses who
could have shed any real light on the
matter, like Lord Astor, were not called.
According to the Judge, the fact that
they did not come forward reflected
adversely on Ward's position.
This seemed to me, a non-lawyer, a
most extraordinary argument. If (to
use the Judge's own weird jargon) there
were “in this city many witnesses of
high estate who could have come and
testified support of his [Ward’s] evi-
dence”, and did not, that might just as
well be taken as reflecting on their
cowardice as on Ward's guilt. Nor
should this Judge be under any misap-
prehension. The non-apppearance of
Lord Astor signified, to the vast major-
ity of ordinary citizens, not Ward's
guilt, but the preferential treatment ac-
corded to the rich and the socially emi-
nent. The prevailing assumption was,
and remains, that anyone poor and a
commoner who had been as intimately
associated with Ward would assuredly
have been summoned to Inspector Her-
bert s nocturnal police-station sessions,
and found himself in the witness-box
under my Lord's august eye. This I
should suppose to be an assumption
more damaging to the Law’s repute than
anything done by Ward with his friends
whether of high or low estate, or with
his fly-blown seraglio. Mr Kennedy
concludes:
“Let no one pretend that our system
of justice is a search for truth. It is
nothing of the kind. It is a contest
between two sides- played according
to certain rules, and if the truth hap.
pens to emerge as the result of the
contest, then that is pure windfall.”
The conclusion is supported only too
well by the Ward trial, Mr Kennedy's
account of which should be read by
every citizen concerned about the low
repute into which our judiciary and
police have fallen of late.

Gregor-Hastie. Fortune Press. 16s,
T>oy McGregor-Hastie visited Aus-
* tralia for some months in 1955 :
spending the first part of that time in
South Australia. The book he has pro-
duced out of his experiences can almos!
take its place beside Jules Verne's
‘'Among the Cannibals” (1867) as an
entertaining presentation of misconcep-
tions. Verne had some excuse, howevei
small, for the romanticized hotch-potch
of Amazon-Deepest Africa that he des-
cribed for the Victorian Gippsland; he
never came to Australia. At times it is
hard to believe that McGregor-Hastie
ever did, either.
There is a pleasant note of the
exotic in the report that sly grog is
“manufactured in great quantities
throughout the State of South Australia
and generally stored in the large alumi-
nium water tanks like the one near the
outside lavatory”; and that “the State of
New Wales (sic) is mostly Southern
England plus good weather to look at”.
Perhaps this kind of nonsense would
be somewhat amusing or even bearable,
if other qualities gave the book some
value. But even the tables of statistics
are out of date.
Allied to this stalemate is a general air
of carping malediction and the kind of
writing that can only be called puerile—
“ The population of Australia can t> e

males and females with a small
floating population in between these
two . . . ”

YOUR

What importance do you place on your business records? It’s
easy to say “Nothing will happen to them,” but it is not always
the other fellow that is devastated by fire ... it could be you!
Only specially built fire-resistant equipment, such as the range
built in Australia by Chubb, can make your records —your
business memory—completely safe from fire. The fact that a
building is fireproof does not alter the fact that the contents of
the building remain inflammable. Today, with the introduction
of the many synthetic materials into office furniture, a fire in a
modern building can create an even more intense heat than
previously experienced. And how do you assess, for an insurance
claim, the list of your outstanding accounts or a secret file that
may have taken years to compile. Make a point to contact Chubb
and to examine the comprehensive range of fire-resistant record-
protection cabinets. It pays to be careful when your business
is at stake.

Australian Aboriginal Studies. Ed.
Helen Sheils. Oxford University
Press. 755.
Tn nearly 500 pages this volume in-
-1 dicates all that is known of the
Australian Aborigines, how it came to
be known, what remains unrecorded
and what has been irrevocably lost.
Here are the papers and edited discus-
sions presented at the 1961 conference
on Aboriginal Studies. The list of con-
ference members runs from Abbie to
Wurm in a “Who’s Who” in Australian
Aboriginal Studies; the papers range
from “The Antiquity of Man in Aus-
tralia” to the “Contemporary Scene”
and the conference report with the re-
commendations which led to the estab-
lishment of the Australian Institute of
Aboriginal Studies. The whole is well
indexed and most papers carry valuable
selected bibliographies.
For all this we owe thanks to Mr
W. C. Wentworth, MHR, who made the
initial proposal which led to the 1961
conference. The book is a must for
those who claim an intelligent lay inter-
est in Aboriginal affairs, and one the
specialist cannot ignore. The informa-
tion is also presented with a pleasing
minimum of jargon.
Curious readers will find that the dis-
cussions also provide insights into the
major figures in Australian Aboriginal
research; one feels from time to time
the pressures of academic politics, and
this adds spice to the volume.
In his foreword the Prime Minister
s a>s: The Commonwealth Government
* s conscious of its direct responsibilities
or tne welfare of Aborigines in its own
territories and of the responsibilities dis-
charged in this field by the various
btate Governments, and it saw the con-
erence as a gathering of scholars direct-
lng their attention to scientific and cul-
tural problems, as distinct from those
’elated to current welfare .”
Although many of the papers empha-
Sls h c nee d for research in situations
ere w dfare is inevitably involved, the
lst °ry of the Institute indicates that the
■overnment s view has been accepted,
or this reason the reader seeking a
u survey of Aborigines in Australian
1 c must await the publication of what
will no doubt become known as the
Rowley Report, at present being under-
taken under the auspices of the Social
Science Research Council and financed
by a private grant.
Through all the papers runs a sense
of urgency. Again and again one reads
that now is the time to get research
done, that delay may mean that infor-
mation now available will be lost for
all time. Already it is too late in many
areas to record more than the rags and
tatters of a way of life now ending for
almost all Aborigines.
The Commonwealth Government has
provided money to support the Insti-
tute’s research but it has not been so
easy to find trained specialists in the
many fields required to achieve the In-
stitute's aims. The gaps in our know-
ledge are enormous and the time re-
maining to fill them is short.

Men who move mountains tttlk fifldUCC with F.C.A,
When it comes to moving mountains of any kind, no two financial problems are alike, no two
companies are similar in their needs. That's why it's our basic philosophy to find the best
ways, the most appropriate means to make money available to individual companies whose
progress contributes to the nation's progress. If you plan to move a mountain soon, and need
finance to do it, come and talk to us.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
It Needs More Than Courage
Australian businessmen took a verbal lacing from one of
Japan’s economists, Professor of Economics at Hitotsu-
bashi University, Tokyo, Dr Kojima, following publica-
tion of his impressions after last year’s tour of Australia and
New Zealand. He regards Australian secondary consumer
goods industries as inefficient and unduly protected by high
tariffs. Economic policy is vague and the economies of
Australia and New Zealand are called “socialised controlled
economies”.
Some of these shortcomings might be recognised and even
admitted locally. But the coldest cut from Dr Kojima was
his claim that the spirit that wants to leap ahead in the
face of dangers, the vigorous
entrepreneurial spirit, does not
exist in Australia and New
Zealand.
There are plenty of people
who are bold and adventurous
enough to leap ahead in the face
of dangers, but it’s a pretty hard
thing to achieve, willing as they
may be. The system is against
it. Try floating a new company
without five years’ attractive
figures and an underwriter and
see how you get on. Try export-
ing without investigating
through proper channels, get-
ting EPIC insurance, and proper
credit endorsements from the
banks. Try leaping ahead against
established manufacturing
groups without getting a swift
bankruptcy notice.
There are many who dare
and many who go broke trying.
These are mainly little people.
Company history in Australia
shows that risk capital for expansion generally is left in tried
and trusted hands.
The newcomer who wants to raise shareholder capital for
such enterprises will discover that, although Australia is a
nation of gamblers, risk money through investments is a
horse of a different color; except for a few regrettable
enthusiasms in land speculation, vending machines, finance
company crashes and the like.
Dr Kojima also accuses Australia and New Zealand of not
having a decisive policy towards Asia. Perhaps this also
is harsh, as Australia and New Zealand of necessity are forced
to recognise, if belatedly, the changing face of world trade
even if it means breaking the habit of remaining tied to
Britain because of “guaranteed” outlets for primary produce.
Some criticisms are justified, no doubt. But they must be
kept in perspective against a background of a very large,
isolated continent, mostly uncultivable in the centre, with a
Australia-New Zealand trade, referred to in an article on the
following page, continues very much in the same pattern
illustrated by the above graph. For the eight months ended
February, New Zealand’s exports to Australia reached
£14,684,000. Australia sent goods totalling £57,259,000 to
New Zealand.
widely spread population of only 11 million (except for
concentrations in the capital cities) and a per capita consump-
tion that necessarily cannot absorb all the locally manufactured
goods, let alone a rising supply of goods from Japan.
Many thinking Australians recognise the need to buy more
from Japan. It is common sense. But a balance of trade
cannot be achieved overnight, particularly as agents for
British, European and US manufacturers of heavy machinery,
chemicals, etc., have been established here for many years.
Those channels of trade were built up painstakingly, too.
Civil engineering contractors, oil exploration contractors
and the like also tend to look to their US or European con-
nections for machinery and
equipment. But this is changing,
too, where contracts involve
Japan.
The Thiess-Peabody associa-
tion with Mitsui in developing
coal deposits at Kianga, Queens-
land, induced the use of Japan-
ese equipment in shifting coal
to Gladstone. Other deals, like
the development of Mt Golds-
worthy ore deposits in WA,
could involve an increasing use
of Japanese heavy equipment.
The automotive industry is
witnessing a rising flow of
Japanese vehicles, although
Government pressures for an in-
crease in the use of Australian
components could present a
problem here.
And, while mentioning the
automotive industry, what ad-
venturous local spirit would
dare to set up a new motor
vehicle manufacturing project
in Australia in competition with the overseas giants?
Also, the entrepreneurial spirits who attempt to start new
hotels, like the Chevron Sydney, with public money are a
warning to those courageous souls who may have similar
inclinations.
Within the limits of the “socialised controlled economies”,
the adventurous spirit does what he can. But Australian
industry is not a purely local gathering of adventurous spirits.
Marketing and exporting' are controlled in many cases by
overseas parent companies, just as Japan's overseas interests
are linked largely with giants like Mitsui, Mitsubishi and other
leading industrial complexes.
Adventurous spirits in Japan, who attempt to import from
Australia in competition with strongly established companies,
discover that it takes more than courage.


Sound Basis for Aust.-NZ
Customs Union
A really comprehensive regional free-trade area is hardly
likely to be created between Australia and New Zealand
as the result of year-long talks soon to reach fruition at
ministerial level. Nevertheless the teams of public servants so
far engaged have become convinced about the benefits of even
limited reductions in Customs walls and a measure of eco-
nomic integration.
Instigated by the enthusiasm of their respective Ministers
for Trade, both sides still entered upon the preliminary dis-
cussions with very significant reservations.
Facing a particularly efficient, cost-healthy dairy and meat
industry in New Zealand, Australia withheld dairy produce
and lamb from the ambit of any possible agreement. Like-
wise, New Zealand did not desire to risk an unprotected cover
for some of its more or less infant manufacturing projects.
From a trading viewpoint, though, the two countries are
each fundamentally primary producers with vigorous and
expansive secondary fringes. They, therefore, possess a suf-
ficiency of common problems, on international and domestic
scales, to make closer linkages feasible as well as advantage-
ous.
Regional and protective arrangements elsewhere, whether
European or Asian, should leave no doubts on the mutually
sustaining capacity of even a fairly narrow Tasman “common
market”. Neither Australia nor New Zealand can afford to
confine the chase for foreign trade, yet a unitary approach
to some matters seems obvious.
It has not taken too long to discover this in respect of timber
and paper industries. The initial proposals actually asked for
a basis “for consideration by Governments for a free trade
area in forest products”, then went on to ask for “other items
suitable for inclusion in a free trade arrangement, either from
the outset or subsequently”.
The ground for continuing trade (and tariff) rationalisation
is thus laid. Motor vehicles and automotive parts seem to
be other manufacturing sectors susceptible to an early degree
of integration. The twin goads of an enlarged market and
import substitution should appeal both to Australia and New
Zealand.
So the count could go on, yet the immediate urge on New
Zealand s part must be the chance to alleviate some part of
the burden of a chronic trade imbalance. The position is
plainly brought out in the graph on the preceding page.
New Zealand, as Australia, also finds itself repeatedly press-
ed by an overall adverse balance of payments situation. Not
for nothing has that been called the country’s key problem by
its Monetary and Economic Council.
The remedies put forward sound startlingly familiar on this
side of the Tasman—“satisfactory prices for temperate agri-
cultural products, widening export markets, increasing the
volume and range of exports, and import saving based on the
promotion of sound industries using indigenous raw materials
to the greatest possible extent”.
The variable picture of oscillating balances causes New
Zealand plenty of worry. Good export earnings don't neces-
sarily guarantee any radical increase in overseas reserves, since
imports remain high.
Only last week, the Minister for Customs, Mr N. Shelton,
had to fix 1964-65 import licensing schedules at 90 per cent
of their 1963-64 levels, reducing allocations over a wide range.
An attempt will be made to keep overseas funds usable for
private imports at approximately the 1963-64 volume.
Buoyed up by excellent commodity prices (the language
once more sounds familiar), New Zealand earned a £NZSI.7
million surplus on purely trade transactions for the 1963 year,
compared with a £57.7 million surplus in 1962 and a £1.5
million deficit in 1961. But 1963 produced an overall £4.5
million deficit on all overseas exchange transactions, against
1962’s £12.4 million surplus and 1961’s £16.6 million deficit.
Last year both export receipts and import payments set
records. Exports certainly climbed up £47.5 million. At the
same time, Government and private imports advanced £53.4
million. Current account, including invisibles, went into deficit
£10.2 million (1962, £2.6 million surplus).
The case for responsible Australia-New Zealand connection
stands out clearly.
Keeping Copper Right
in the Picture
F ondon Metal Exchange spot copper prices continue to
weave a wayward path. Moving around £stg3ls a ton
(for contract wirebars), they stand well above the producers’
fixed selling price of £244.
This latter price has been held despite strikes in the Congo
mines, threatened wage troubles in Chile and America, and a
strong tendency among consumers to stockpile. It must be
remembered that the producers dispose of about 3.8 million
short tons a year, whereas a mere 130,000 tons pass through
the LME.
If the various crises fade, world production in 1964 will
just about satisfy demand. The presence of plastic and
aluminium substitutes exercises a steadying influence on pro-
ducer prices.
The longer-term supply position has just been heartened by
the discovery of a huge and remarkably rich lode 350 miles
north of Ontario (Canada) by a US group, Texas Gulf Sulphur.
Some 25 million tons of ore are reputedly proved.
Australia is not to be left out from the development of new
sources. Conzinc Riotinto’s decision to mine and treat the
Rum Jungle intermediate prospects may look like chickenfeed.
More sizeable, though, is Cobar, where CRA is associated with
Broken Hill South. A production rate of 30,000 tons of ore
a month should begin in July, 1965.
Tipsters’ Poll
on Share Buying
\5/hile the share market backpedals and the hire purchase
shares reflect the Reserve Bank-induced hardening of
short term interest rates (so soon after many of them had
pared debenture rates), investors have become confused in
assessing buying prospects.
A crop of sharebrokers’ circulars, however, suggests at least
four avenues for placement of funds. One Melbourne share-
broker suggests investments for an inflationary climate (BHP
Minster, Herald & Weekly Times, National Consolidated,
Myer Emporium, CRA, Mt Isa) while another Southern broker
suggests that retailers should benefit from the basic wage case.
Either way, The Bulletin has been suggesting for months
that the well-established retailers like Myer, Grace Bros,
David Jones should benefit from current expansion.
Sydney brokers are offering a mixed bag, and two recent
circulars claim that food industry shares are not over-priced
and that continuing prosperity should help shares like Aus-
tralian Gypsum, Grace Bros, National Consolidated, Elec-
trical Equipment, News Ltd, Lindemans and Harper Davidson.
On the food front, shares mentioned include Allied Mills,
Big Sister, Bushells, Captain Products, CSR, Cottees, Keith
Harris, Joe White Makings, Marrickville, Peters and Seakist.
If you take a tipsters’ poll and select the shares which
occur consistently in various circulars, there is an inevitable
weight of opinion for solid, high-priced shares like BHP,
Myer, National Consolidated, Mt Isa, etc. This seems to be
borne out on the score of history and security.

Electrolytic Zinc
Links with Planet
Tt is good to see two local Australian companies joining to-
gether to seek base metals around Loiith, western NSW.
Planet Oil and Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australia (operating
subsidiary of EZ Industries Ltd) have signed an agreement
which provides for an extensive programme of exploration at
no cost to Planet.
The more irons in the fire the better Planet shareholders
will like it, so that they can achieve a spread of risk . . .
provided, of course, they are not required to put up more
money. Prime mover behind the scenes is Planet's chairman,
Mr J. G. Fuller, once nicknamed the oil millionaire when he
achieved a handsome vendor interest at the time of floating
Planet. Mr Fuller is reported to be the owner of Quality
Industries Pty Ltd, which carried out the aeromagnetic survey
to search for base metals around Louth.
Electrolytic Zinc has exercised its option to take up a half
interest in the project, so Planet shareholders will lose nothing
on the score of a prestige partner.


ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Putting Imports in Perspective
When AIDA was right, but not QUITE right
TI/hile the National Bank of Aus-
” tralasia last week lauded the fact that
one of the most striking features of the
upsurge in business activity since early
in 1962 has been the comparatively in-
significant rise in imports, the Australian
Industries Development Association was
bemoaning the fact that “one of the least
satisfactory aspects of 1962-63 was the
very considerable rise in value of mer-
chandise imports which were 22.2 p.c.
higher than in the previous year and con-
tinued to increase in the remaining six
months of 1963 when they were 5 p.c.
higher than in the July-December period
of 1962.”
Of course, AIDA is quite right. There
was a 22.2 p.c. rise in imports last year,
but it was an increase on a year when
imports were particularly depressed by
the recession here. In fact, imports of
£1,078 million in 1962-63 were on about
the same level as 1960-6 l’s £1,085
million from which they descended to
only £BB2 million in 1961-62.
Perhaps even AIDA would admit that
in 1961-62 the low level of imports was
a reflection of the sorry state of industrial
activity in this country and not one
compatible with a healthy economy.
It is surely a thin argument to draw
from this 22.2 p.c. rise on 1961-62
such a strong statement as AIDA’s that
it has “strongly and repeatedly emphas-
ised the need for more positive direction
of government policy to ensure that our
industrial resources are not wasted be-
cause of unnecessary imports, which
cause Australian industries to operate at
less than optimum capacity and there-
fore at reduced efficiency and higher
cost.”
the other hand, while exhibiting the
same interest as AIDA in imports re-
placement, the National Bank has gone
to some trouble to show that the rise in
imports is somewhat less than one might
normally have expected in the light of
the gradual attainment of full employ-
ment, the fact that domestic production
has climbed to new record levels and
that we have now some 875,000 more
people in Australia than in 1960.
“There is conclusive evidence of no
increase in imports to parallel the large
rise in personal outlays on consumer
goods and private capital expenditure
which has taken place since 1962, and
which has been bolstered up this financial
year by substantially greater government
spending”, says the Bank. “Reference
to the proportion of this aggregate ex-
penditure going into imports each quarter
reveals that the proportions are well be-
low the previous full employment period
in 1960”.
For instance, in the December quarter
1963 the proportion of aggregate ex-
penditure accounted for by imports was
11.2 p.c. whereas in the same quarter
1963 it was 12.9 p.c. Also, in the year to
March 31 last expenditure per head of
population on imports was only £93 as
against £95 a head in 1960-61.
The National Bank proceeds to draw
some heartening conclusions from this
subdued rate of importing. “At present,”
it says, “our overseas balance of pay-
ments position is particularly strong, with
the possibility, on a rough estimate, of
overseas reserves being in the vicinity of
£875 million by the end of the current
financial year in June next. Such reserves
would appear to be adequate to enable
us to cope with, at least for some little
time, a demand ‘spill-over’ into sub-
stantially increased imports if, by any
chance, this should occur.
“However, on current prospects such
a development appears unlikely because
there is a relatively high rate of personal
saving, partly as a result of this season’s
high level of farm income being regard-
ed by recipients as abnormal, and partly
due to much greater public caution
stemming from the effects of the 1960
credit squeeze.
“Evidence of this is that personal con-
sumption expenditure between the Dec-
ember quarters of 1962 and 1963 rose
by only a little under 6 p.c. while per-
sonal savings increased by 21 p.c. In the
same period, private capital expenditure
also rose by only about 6 p.c. and there
has been a comparatively modest level
of new capital raisings by Australian
companies in contrast to the very large
inflow of cash into bank deposits”.
However, a word of warning may be
appropriate here in that one reason for
the failure of imports to faithfully follow
the upward curve of gross national
product thus far seems to be that private
investment was the last of the income
generating forces to get into higher gear.
“With such a high proportion of im-
ports consisting of capital goods, not sur-
prisingly the increase in these has been
pretty modest over the last year or more,
even if it has in fact been greater than
the movement in the rest of the imports
bill.”
This late start of private investment
is, of course, mainly a reflection of sur-
plus industrial capacity, and it may be
expected that the more production pushes
existing plant and equipment nearer to
capacity, the greater will be the demand
for imports of capital goods.
The same argument could also apply,
though to a lesser extent, in the case of
consumption goods (though imports of
these have risen only from £139.5 to
£141.7 million in the first eight months
this year), especially if effective demand
gets another big boost from a basic
wage increase in the current condition
bearing closely on over-full employment.
Nonetheless both in the case of capital
and consumption goods, and to some
extent in producers’ materials, import
replacement has made us less vulnerable
to the. pressures exerted by local demand
on imports.
fpHE National Bank is very impressed
both with our achievements in this
direction as well as for the case for
import replacement in general, though it
may possibly be over-estimating the
extent to which the imports bill has been
lightened in the last few years from this
influence. It may also be neglecting the
possibility that policies of import re-
placement might be being pushed too far
in the light of the necessities of reciprocal
trade.
“The whole phenomenon of import re-
placement, especially when seen as an
evolutionary process, becomes not only a
vital aid to stability in our balance of
overseas payments, but also a funda-
mental necessity to our industrial deve-
lopment in the broadest sense,” the Bank
says. “To make this point by an exag-
gerated, hypothetical illustration: One
only has to think of an Australia which
tried to devote its growing resources of
people and skill solely to expanding pri-
mary products and attempted to import
everything else.
“The result of such a misguided at-
tempt would be a growing lack of oppor-
tunities for employment, a grave narrow-
ing of our industrial development and,
sooner or later, the emergence of an in-
superable balance of overseas payments
problem which would cripple our capa-
city to progressively enlarge the volume
of imports we must have.
“Paradoxically, success in achieving a
much higher degree of import replace-
ment along evolutionary lines enables a
steadier, and more secure, rise in imports
over the years to meet the needs of a
growing population and a growing indus-
trial system.
“Imports may form a declining pro-
portion of our total expenditure, but, in
volume and value, they must tend to
increase as the years go by and the
nation’s economy steadily grows larger.”

The Cost of Furniture Goes Up
Industry’s future sound, despite cheap labor imports
With an increasing population
the furniture industry, like many
other industries, has benefited.
But how long this will continue is
a big question with manufacturers
whom The Bulletin interviewed
last week. They say an increase
of 5 p.c. in the price of furniture
to retailers is inevitable and that
further increases are quite possible.
Imports from low labor cost
countries pose further problems for
the industry. Still at present manu-
facturers feel that the future is
sound despite the problems of
costs and imports.
A ustralia’s furniture industry, at pre-
sent producing about £5O million
worth of goods a year, is facing the
prospect of increased costs and imports
from cheap labor countries, but overall
the future appears to be sound.
Retail sales of furniture and floor
coverings (unfortunately the Common-
wealth Statistician does not break down
this classification) in 1957-58 totalled
£97.6 million. They grew to a peak of
£116.8 million in 1960-61 and settled at
£116.5 million last financial year. The
expanding population, due to the influx
of migrants, and the increasing number
of marriages, caused this increase.
Figures from the NSW Guild of
Furniture Manufacturers indicate that
Australians spend twice as much on fur-
niture as they do on floor coverings. In
1963, of the £116.5 million spent on
furniture and floor coverings, about 68
p.c. or £79 million was spent on furni-
ture and the balance of £37.5 million
was spent on floor coverings.
Managing secretary of the NSW Guild
of Furniture Manufacturers, Mr J. L.
Simpson, said manufacturers were very
concerned about the “import situation”.
“Wherever imports threaten us we are
trying to meet and beat competition,”
he said. “On most fronts we can do
this except where furniture is made in
countries with low labor costs.
“For instance, imports have killed the
cane furniture industry in Australia be-
cause it is produced in low labor cost
areas. Manufacturers of raw materials
in Australia are helping us meet the
import competition by producing com-
petitive goods.”
IV/¥r Simpson said the bulk of Aus-
tralia’s furniture imports of £1.5
million came from Japan and Hong
Kong, cheap labor areas. But imports
also came from all over the world. In
March, for instance, they came from
Germany, the UK, Italy, Spain, Finland,
the US, Switzerland, China, France and,
of course, Japan and Hong Kong, but it
was only the last two countries that
worried Australian manufacturers.
“We can compete with the imports
from the other countries because of their
similar cost structure,” he said, “but the
cheap labor in Japan and Hoijg Kong is,
we feel, unfair competition.
“As far as manufacturers are con-
cerned, our industry is extremely
efficient. We are not concerned about
our internal set-up, but about tariffs on
imported raw materials. Tariffs expose
us to further imports because of the cost
gap between our finished product using
imported materials and the imported
finished product.
“Over the years it has gradually grown
wider, and some retailers find it profitable
to import the finished goods from low
labor cost countries rather than buy in
Australia.
“We have been encouraging the tariff
to get Australian raw material suppliers
to start promoting their own product.
We are trying to beat it internally rather
than run straight to the Tariff Board.
“The furniture industry knows full well
that if any move is taken to further in-
crease the price of the locally manu-
factured product, or if any action is
taken which might restrict style, design
or general appeal of locally manufactured
furniture, then this would only serve to
further increase imports.”
Apart from the threat of imports, in-
creased costs to the industry will mean
an almost certain 5 p.c. rise in price to
retailers in the near future, Mr Simpson
said.
Several factors had caused this. Quite
recently the Tariff Board had placed
additional duties on imported island tim-
bers. This, coupled with an increase in
freights and decrease in availability of
suitable supplies from British Borneo,
Malaysia and the Indonesian areas had
had the effect of increasing the cost of
cabinet timbers to manufacturers by
approximately 10 p.c.
Some time after the Tariff Board en-
quiry increased duties on imported tim-
bers, distributors of Tasmanian timbers
advised the furniture trade that Tasman-
ian oak (used extensively in furniture
manufacturing) would increase in price
immediately by 5 p.c.
wholesale price of mirrors to the
furniture manufacturing industry,
controlled by the Glass Merchants’ Asso-
ciation, has, since Christmas, advanced
by as much as 50 p.c. in some cases.
“This has had the effect of increasing
the manufacturers’ cost of a bedroom
suite with a small mirror (about two feet
by three) by approximately 30s. and a
bedroom suite with a large mirror by
about £3,” said Mr Simpson. “Rates of
pay for apprentices in the industry were
increased last month by approximately
10 p.c. to bring them into line with the
increases previously granted to trades-
men.
“Certain grades of plywood which were
previously regarded as belonging to a
certain grade-price group are now being
classified in a higher grade-price group
with the result that some manufacturers
are now paying as much as 20 p.c. more
for exactly the same grade and quality of
plywood. Plywood in some cases rep-
resents a considerable proportion of the
total cost.
“As regards the future we are very
much afraid that the increases will not
stop at this point as currently there are
several applications before the
Tariff Board for increased protective
duties on ticking, raw materials used in
the manufacture of PVC-coated cloths
and a number of other items used by the
furniture industry.
“It would seem, too, that the industry
is suffering from over-capacity which has
further trimmed profit margins. Not a
great deal of capital is required to start
in the industry and that is another of its
bugs. There are many people within the
industry who, because of this, are not
making even a reasonable crust.”
The growth of the furniture industry,
due to the increasing population and the
influence of migrants, has been rapid over

the past ten years. Fifteen years ago
manufacturers were producing furniture
that grandmother had. Competitions were
run to get new styles of furniture but
they were not very successful, Then the
furniture mart was introduced, and here
manufacturers displayed their latest
ranges and retailers were asked to name
their preferences. This has led to the
development of the Australian furniture
industry to its present level.
“Ten years ago,” said Mr Simpson,
“we found that the public was starving
for something different. This stimulated
the whole industry. Now we have a
problem in catering for all the mixed
tastes among consumers. Italians, for in-
stance, go for camphor laurel furniture
while other migrants go for less fancy
lines. We have to find something in the
middle it's not easy to do.
“Most manufacturers now are in-
fluenced by what happens overseas. Ten
years ago it would be quite an event if
a manufacturer went overseas. Now it is
happening all the time. The Scandinavian
influence on our furniture is very strong.
American style furniture does not sell
well here, neither does the conservative
British style.”
As with most other manufacturing in-
dustries, apprentices, or rather the
lack of them, are a problem with the
furniture manufacturers. With the big
money available to young people nowa-
days they are reluctant to become appren-
ticed on a low wage. Another labor pro-
blem is the shortage of tradesmen.
Whenever there is a downturn in the
industry many of them leave to go to
other industries such as building. They
never return. To add to this there is
greater mechanisation in furniture build-
ing and skill is leaving the industry.
Mr Simpson said the furniture industry
would continue “as at present, unless
imports get too strong.”
Mr Hyman Don, chairman and man-
aging director of Don Industries Ltd,
said his company was using less and less
imported material to cover his furniture.
The Australian industry was now pro-
ducing coverings comparable with any
in the world, but his firm still imported
some because of the design or color.
“This year we have used more locally
produced coverings than ever before,”
he said, “and it looks as though it will
continue, although I don’t think the day
will come when we will use local
materials entirely.
“As far as imported raw materials are
concerned, I don’t know that competition
is very great. Furniture timbers in the
main are not imported except teak and
certain other special timbers. Other
materials such as springs, foam rubber
and so on, are all made here so the
Australian content is very high.
“The bulk of our supplies comes from
local sources. Imports haven't affected
us particularly, but I would imagine that
it would affect the industry as a whole.
“Because of increased rates of pay,
short-service leave and longer annual
holidays, I think prices will go up by
between 2i and 5 p.c. It is already
happening now, and some lines of furni-
ture are already carrying the higher
price tag. But even with the higher prices,
the public is getting a lot better value
and quality for their money than they
were five years ago because of the more
modern methods of production.
“Our sales and production are ahead of
last year and we are well in front of our
budget. It will continue like this for the
rest of the year.”
T\on Industries, which produces all
types of living-room furniture,
would expand shortly into the fields of
dining and bedroom furniture, Mr Don
said. The company had also undertaken
commercial furnishing; for instance, it
supplied the furniture for the Empress
of Australia, the passenger-vehicle ship
which will ply between Sydney and
Tasmania.
Mr Don said competition between
furniture manufacturers was strong.
There were a lot of people in the field
but this position was correcting itself.
In the last few years a number of big
companies had gone out of business and
no new ones had come in. And the
companies left in the field were certainly
not over-producing. There was a pretty
good balance between supply and
demand.
“The influence of the migrant on
Australian furniture tastes has been quite
substantial,” Mr Don said. “They have
brought to this country some styles from
their home countries, and they probably
have a better taste in furniture than the
average Australian. The paint companies,
too, have helped the furniture industry
by making young people more aware of
color and the influence it can have on
interior decoration.
“And I think we are creating an Aus-
tralian style of furniture,” Mr Don said.
“This is influenced greatly by the Scan-
dinavian countries with their emphasis on
modernity and lightness of construction.
As the younger people become more
aware of style we may go back to the
traditional designs like those which are
now popular in America.
“Profitability should get better. The
industry is emerging from the backyard
to the organised factory. There is less
and less room for the backyard manu-
facturer because, with the bigger popu-
lation and demand, the retailer looks to
the large manufacturer for supply.”
Mr Don said his company had investi-
gated the possibilities of exporting and
submitted prototype furniture to over-
seas firms. But because of the bulk of
the goods and the high freight cost it
was unlikely to export.
TI/|r H. Sebel, managing director of
Sebels (Australia) Ltd which makes
tubular steel furniture, said although his
firm faced competition it was not as
severe as competition in domestic
furniture.
“We supply the contract furniture
business in Australia and a lot of school
furniture. Because it is so competitive
we must build the furniture to last and
live up to the ten-year guarantee we give.
“There is a steadily rising trend in
costs in the industry,” he said. “We were
able to hold costs for about seven years
until two years ago when prices went up.
And there is bound to be further in-
creases in price in the future.
“We use some imported coverings for
our furniture but it is less than 20 p.c. of
our total requirements.
“The future looks very sound. The
Australian market is getting more sophis-
ticated, and furniture we produced ten
or 12 years ago is being superseded by
new designs and styles. This will con-
tinue,” Mr Sebel added.
It is impossible to forecast the future
of the furniture industry with further
cost increases in the offing, but, provided
present prosperity continues, there seems
to be no reason why it should not con-
tinue to grow. For people must have
furniture for new homes and the number
of large office buildings, factories,
schools, etc., must have chairs and tables
and desks.

“CROESUS”
It Couldn’t Happen in the US
That grab for the biscuit barrel
T>ossibly because the Australian Bis-
A cuit Company already has 70 p.c.
of the Australian biscuit market, nobody
here seemed to be very concerned that
it would push its share up to 80 p.c. if
it succeeded in getting Swallow and
Ariell. Nobody, that is, except Mr
Frank Gurgone, Nabisco’s “chief nego-
tiator” for takeovers, who is sticking it
out in Melbourne until his tussle with
the ABC is settled one way or the other.
But then Mr Gurgone lives in the anti-
monopolistic climate of the USA.
As he says, “American law would not
allow one company to control that
much of the market but I am not
criticising Australian law.”
This comment can be relished at a
time when the Federal Attorney-
General (Mr Snedden), after a long
string of predecessors for 53 years have
made no use of the Australian Industries
Preservation Act to keep monopolists
from exploiting the public, has suddenly
chosen to prosecute a number of Can-
berra victuallers for alleged restrictive
practices.
Although Mr Snedden is probably not
so much concerned about the alleged
breaches as he is to test the strength
of the Act, Mr Gurgone must wonder
at Mr Snedden's current preoccupation
with an issue of such small import com-
pared with, say, the larger restrictive
practices proposals on his hands, the
more so, perhaps, as the alleged breach-
es in question seem to be condoned, if
not inspired, by two State Governments.
Tt must also seem very strange to Mr
Gurgone, whose company has had
to live with the Sherman Anti-Trust Act
for so long it has been on the books
since 1890 to find in his time be-
tween making bids not only that the
main local grudge about Nabisco,
voiced mainly by Mr Arthur Calwell
and Sir Herbert Hyland, is that its bid
for Swallow’s is an example of the trend
of giant US groups swallowing up
established Australian companies with-
out adding anything to the economy,
but also that we have just awakened to
the possible dangers of unfettered
monopolies. Not that there has been
any suggestion that Australia’s monopo-
lies be broken up; only that their prac-
tices be put under close scrutiny.
As matters stand at the moment, the
Australian Biscuit Company seems to
share more of the total market for bis-
cuits here than any other companies in
their particular fields with the glaring
exception of Broken Hill Proprietary,
whose only competitors in the local
market for steel are importers of fabri-
cated products, some of whom it is
linked to in any case.
Tn his introduction to “The Economics
of Australian Industry”, Professor
Alex Hunter mentions 14 firms, inclu-
ding BHP, who were large natural
monopolies of an industry or sub-
industry. Others included John Lysaght
for sheet steel, the CSR Co. for refined
sugar, ACI for glass and glass products,
and Australian Newsprint Mills and
APM for heavy paper and paper board.
All these would have as much and some
of them more than 70 p.c. of the local
market for their main products.
Thanks largely to the Sherman Anti-
Trust Act, industry in the United States,
for all the bigness of individual firms in
that country, is without the monopoly
layers which dominate so many indus-
tries here. Some time ago the National
Resources Committee’s “Structure of the
American Economy” pointed out that in
only three industries motor vehicles,
automotive bodies and parts, and meat
packing did the four largest firms
occupy more than 50 p.c. of the market,
and in all these cases none of the four
firms involved had a predominant share.
In the steel industry, the four leading
firms (all of massive size) had slightly
less than 50 p.c. of the market, and in
the electrical machinery industry the
top four had about 44 p.c. Then fol-
lowed boots and shoes (26 p.c.), fruit
and vegetable canning (23 p.c.) and
printing and publishing (21 p.c.), the
only others in which the first four firms
had more than 20 p.c. of the local
market.
To the charge that it has too big a
share of our local biscuit market, it
should be said in fairness to the Aus-
tralian Biscuit Company that it has, in
fact, been driven towards a monopoly
position by the possibility that at one
stage Nabisco itself threatened to devour
one or more of the independent pro-
prietary companies which ultimately
joined forces in self defence against it.
Its huge share of the market has, so to
speak, been an accident of circum-
stances. As Paul A. Samuelson, an
American economist, has said: “The
Federal courts and lawyers in the De-
partment of Justice are greatly con-
cerned over the exact way in which a
monopoly comes into existence as much
as they are with its economic incidence
and the motives of people rather than
the effects of their action.”
Jt may make a difference to the legal
mind whether a man creates a mono-
poly by a deliberate act of buying up
rivals, or whether he is simply given a
wedding present of his rivals’ plants by
his fiancee’s father. (It is not suggested
the ABC is going to get Kraft’s plants
from Miss Ann Osborne’s father.) To
the economist, of course, only the final
suppression of competition and raising
of prices count.
Again, this time in fairness to Nabis-
co, its bid for Swallow's is not as bad
in the national sense as Mr Calwell and
Sir Herbert Hyland have painted it.
Maybe, up to a point, this is just
another in the long line of 34 food com-
panies taken over by big international
and local food groups in recent years,
but at least Nabisco intends to give us
something in addition to the money it is
offering for Swallow’s.
Mr Gurgone has been very frank in
saying that, even if its bid fails, it is
still going to bake biscuits here and it
is not going to be satisfied with the
10 p.c. share of the market that Swal-
low's would give it.
“Our ambition is to expand, and if we
did not think we could do it we would
have stayed in New York,” he told us.
In fact, the company is already here
in a big way in the breakfast foods and
other business as a result of its take-
over of Purina in 1960 and is currently
drawing plans to build a new factory
on a 27-acre site it has purchased at
Broadmeadows to which it would pro-
bably transfer Swallow’s operations
from the long outmoded factory at Port
Melbourne.
In short, whichever way the battle for
Swallow’s goes, Nabisco is, for one
thing, going to give us a brand new
factory and also bring in techniques in
biscuit-making which should give a few
headaches to the ABC in the competi-
tive struggle that is bound to ensue.

A Fallen Investment Idol
Deposit and Investment’s debts bombshell
\ tumble from a peak of 15s. 9d. in
1963 to 6s. sd. or thereabouts now,
puts Deposit and Investment Co. Ltd
in the front ranks of fallen investment
idols.
Heavy trading in the ss. shares,
associated with falling prices they
were 9s. on February 2 this year, 7s. 6d.
at the end of March, and ss. 3d. on
April 27 drew a request for an
explanation from the Sydney Stock
Exchange.
The chairman (Mr W. R. Schofield)
played for time with a reply that the
company had no liquidity problems,
and that a further statement would be
made later in the week.
This proved to be another bad and
doubtful debts bombshell. An extra
£600,000 has been provided by a transfer
from reserves to supplement the
£187,000 provided from the same source
after an investigation last October, and
augmenting the provision at last balance
date, lune 30, of £410,000. (The weak
spots are believed to be financing used
car dealers, particularly in the Parra-
matta area.)
An assurance from the directors that
a 10 p.c. dividend will be paid for
1963-64, and that trading profit for the
eight months to February (after normal
tax and bad and doubtful debts) is in
excess of the dividend rate of 10 p.c.,
gives shareholders little comfort, if
directors can be doubtful about such
massive debts.
Anyone reading the directors’ report
is left in doubt anyway as to whether
the company has already earned
£400,000 net, or only two-thirds of this
dividend commitment.
Weekly cash intake of the group is
believed to be £220,000, compared with
advances of £130,000. While this may
indicate an absence of liquidity prob-
lems, it shows a very substantial reduc-
tion in business, and profit potential.
Under the new management of Mr G.
L. A. Donohoo (formerly on the board
but not concerned with the company’s
day-to-day affairs) it is hoped the com-
pany will achieve early stability, and
that never again will it be forced into
the mushroom growth of 1961-63.
The Battle Goes On
Australian Biscuit Company ob-
viously made a very thorough ex-
amination of the Swallow’s nest before
making its second bid of 525. 6d. (after
brokerage). Almost two weeks elapsed
between Nabisco’s second bid on April
9 and the ABC’s latest on April 22.
During that time, research even went
as far as holding a conference with
Swallow's directors. The fact is that the
ABC can only bid to a certain extent
before it reaches the stage where the
cash layout necessary would be better
spent in protecting its share of the
market against the coming of Nabisco.
If the ABC succeeds, it must lay out
more than £1 million. Moreover, it will
inevitably be in the position of having
to find the finance to protect itself and
compete with Nabisco. For this reason

the directors will probably not make an-
other offer if their 525. 6d. is topped.
It is the foothold which Nabisco is
striving for, to the almost complete ex-
clusion of all other considerations.
Nabisco, therefore, does not have to
waste time investigating these other con-
siderations.
Even in the early stages the ABC took
its time over any decisions. Its bid on
April 8 came five days after Nabisco’s
original 40s. The odds are very high in
favor of Nabisco making one more bid,
and they are just as good for that bid to
be the last.
But even if this does happen, Swal-
low’s may decide to prevent any over-
seas control and recommend acceptance
of a slightly lower ABC offer.
.Crystal’s Prospects Not Clear
Shareholders of Crystal Clothing In-
dustries Ltd show remarkable
loyalty in the face of none too encour-
aging reports from the company.
Sales in the December half-year were
maintained, and there was a small im-
provement in net earnings.
In the last June year, a profit of
£7,919 was insufficient to meet the pre-
ference dividend commitment, so earn-
ing rate on ordinary capital was nil.
A £40,000 bad debt write-off in re-
spect of the Reid Murray account was
an abnormal factor affecting that year’s

of reserves) was maintained nonetheless,
and an interim 6£ p.c. has just been
declared.
The ss. shares recently changed hands
at Bs. 6d. (income yield 7.3 p.c.), about
the same as at the end of last year.
There should be some retreat from this
level if this one-time favorite fails to
come good in the second half of the
current year.

increased during the period, and they
are currently fully income-producing,
while the hotel (Menzies) is also trading
profitably.

million under the price estimated by the
Snowy Mountains Authority. Thiess
announced that a new tunnelling method
would reduce costs on the Geehi Dam
and six miles of tunnel as well as the
seven-mile Murray 1 pressure tunnel.
Most of the difficulties of the first half
of the current year arose from a section
of tunnelling operations in the Snowy.
Directors also blamed the abnormally
wet weather in NSW for adversely
affecting several other contracts.
Failure to pay an interim dividend
put the ss. shares down a couple of
shillings on the pre-news price of
Bs. 4d. Uncertainty about the size of
the loss doesn’t help the market in
assessing the value of the shares.
Directors have said they expect the
reversal in trading to be arrested in the
current year. That is not to say that
any final dividend will be paid. Liqui-
dity may be a major consideration. (A
long-term loan is now being negotiated
to finance the massive volume of work
on hand.) ■
At least Thiess’ troubles may be
nearly over; the contract for the tunnel-
ling operations is now 89 p.c. complete.
But another Queensland-based civil
engineer, Hornibrook Ltd, is experien-
cing difficulties over a prolonged period.
Its loss for the December six months
was £144,136, mainly on the Mt Isa
railway project, after a loss of £138,061
in the previous year to June 30. The
Mt Isa project is not yet finished, so
“substantial” losses are expected in the
second half of the year.
Hornibrook did not enter any large
contracts during the half-year. Current
jobs are the superstructure of the Syd-
ney Opera House, wheat silos at Port
Adelaide and the Kangaroo Creek road.
Engineering and construction work on
a large scale always involves hazards for
the investors.
H, G. Palmer Leads the Way
MLC subsidiary H. G. Palmer
(Consolidated) Ltd was the first
commercial borrower to lift interest
rates following the increase in bank
deposit rates.
Rates offered in a £500,000 debenture
and unsecured deposit note issue were
i p.c. higher for all terms between
three months and three years than in
the issue of November last.
Turnover and profit for the six months
to December were again records, the
company announced simultaneously.
M. Clark’s Big Issue
size of the share issue (one-for-
A two) announced by Sydney retailer
Marcus Clark and Co. Ltd, and the 2s.
premium on the ss. shares did not find
immediate favor on the stock market.
First reaction was to put the shares
down from 11s. 3d. to 9s. 6d.
The issue, available also to convert-
ible noteholders, will raise ordinary
capital from £753,645 to £ 1,332,936,
and give better balance between share-
holders’ funds and creditors. (It is the
company’s first share issue since a one-
for-two at par in October, 1955.)
The £811,006 collected from the
issue will replace short-term deposits
which at last August 3 were as high as
£1,268,000. It also provides permanent
capital now that the development pro-
gramme is almost complete.
Capital will be further increased by
£404,938 on January 31, 1965, when
the 8 p.c. notes convert.
Marcus Clark expects to be able to
continue the 10 p.c. dividend paid for
the last two years, shareholders were
told on notification of the current issue.
Brambles Bounds Ahead
Troubling the earnings of Brambles
Industries Ltd in the first half of
the current year may give an over-
optimistic estimate of its profit for the
current year to June 30.
This is because tax losses were avail-
able from subsidiaries (it is not known
if these are exhausted), and there are
fewer public holidays than in the second
half.
On the results announced to date,
however, it may fairly be deduced that,
barring misadventure, the earning rate
for 1963-64 will be nearer 30 p.c. than
last year's 25.4 p.c.
The investment in the Perth customs,
shipping agency and transport business
of Frank Manford Pty Ltd has not yet
yielded anything. Benefits from the
associate company, the SA civil con-
tractor, Wilckens Hornibrook Brambles
Constructions Ltd, are not expected be-
fore 1964-65.

The 55 p.c. improvement in trading
for the first half of the year, compared
with its 1962 counterpart, gratified
directors, who acknowledged the more
balanced trading conditions throughout
the nation.
The ss. shares now bring 235. to
yield 4.3 p.c. on the traditional 20 p.c.
dividend.
Brambles' interim report illustrates
for shareholders its activities in trans-
port, materials handling, industrial ser-
vices, engineering and allied work. This
is a practice other companies could
adopt in reporting to shareholders.
An Eye to the Future
Cascade Brewery Co. will un-
doubtedly see its 1963-64 earning
rate boosted to new heights by the intro-
duction of canned beer and stout. The
company operates in Tasmania as a
brewer and hotel owner. The 1962-63
profit equalled 34.7 p.c. on ordinary
capital, thus giving an extremely heavy
cover for the 10 p.c. dividend.
It may seem rather ungenerous of
directors not to make a bigger payout
under these circumstances, but their
decision was obviously made with an eye
to the future. At the end of 1965 a
£728,000 note conversion is due and, as
a result, ordinary capital will be doubled.
If last year’s performance is main-
tained in future years, the earning rate
would drop to 17 p.c. on the new capi-
tal, giving a much narrower dividend
cover.
The introduction of cans will help
the company to boost the profit figure.
Cans have proved successful for other
Australian brewers and some soft drink
manufacturers, so there is no reason
why Cascade should not benefit from
the decision.
Unfortunately for Tasmania, it would
be uneconomical for the cans to be
manufactured there, so they will be
brought over from Melbourne as a
palletised cargo in the Bass Trader or
the Princess of Tasmania.
Malco Places More Shares
"Tlirectors of Malco Industries Ltd
did a good job in placing 26,972
ss. shares at Bs. 3d. when the market
value w'as two or three pence lower.
In December 100,000 shares were
placed privately at Bs.
This Sydney foundryman, which took
over Hasemer Crane and Engineering
Ltd during the six months to December,
1963, reported satisfactory profit and
sales increases for that period. It
expected further improvement in the
second half of the year, judging by the
orders in hand.
The company is on a 10 p.c. dividend
basis, so the shares at present show a
yield of 6.2 p.c.


Can British Tobacco Stage a Comeback?
Shares’ high yield from resilient earnings
By ROGER RANDERSON
British Tobacco Company (Aus-
tralia) Limited now opposed by
vigorous competitors, especially Roth-
mans, and under the same cloud as they
are because of persistent criticism of
the smoking habit from medical quarters
is no longer the great stock exchange
leader that it used to be.
Nevertheless, the company’s ordinary
shares must still be regarded as among
the soundest of Australia’s industrial in-
vestments.
British Tobacco’s accumulated finan-
cial strength, far in excess of the large
book value of its assets, is quite un-
mistakable.
Following modernisation of machi-
nery and marketing methods, there are
signs that the company has not merely
stabilised its share of the market, but
is setting out to win back some of the
ground that Rothmans had wrested from
it.
At the same time, British Tobacco
possesses far greater assets with fewer
liabilities and has a much more liquid
position, so that it is better able than
competitors to diversify its activities
against the probably distant day when
“My Lady Nicotine” will loosen her
grip on human beings.
The steady allocation of resources for
far-sighted pastoral and manufacturing
activities, although time must pass be-
fore they add appreciably to revenue,
makes for future stability, and can be
regarded as an. element of superiority
over competitive investments in the
tobacco field.
for all real and imaginable
risks, British Tobacco’s £1 ordinary
share seems to be good value at 285., to
show a dividend yield of about
£7 a year from each £lOO invested, while
the earnings yield on last year’s results
is as high as 9.5 p.c.
The chairman's address to share-
holders last February, although it em-
phasised that there was “no room for
complacency or over-confidence”, was
distinctly more cheerful than it had been
in previous years.
Mr T. J. N. Foley was able to report
that, after a number of years of sharp
decline, 1962-63 showed a fall in sales
of non-filter cigarettes of “a consider-
ably less degree”.
At the same time the company had
been “successful in capturing more than
50 p.c. of the overall market increase in
filter sales”, “Craven Filter” and
“Country Life” having been the star per-
formers.
Filter-tipped brands had again ac-
counted for “substantially more than
half” of the much improved total sales
of cigarettes during the year, which
were evidence of brighter prospects for
the future.
This was in distinct and pleasing con-
trast to Mr Foley’s references in the
previous year to the destruction of the
company’s market position by seriously
revolutionary changes in demand, which
coincided with “a strong use of Govern-
ment import licensing policy to reduce
the company's share of the market.”
And he no longer had to refer to
strenuous efforts being “time and again
nullified because every successive move
in public choice towards filter-tipped
cigarettes meant a further decline in
non-filter brands, almost all of which
were owned by your company”.
Rothman’s initial coup in persuading
the authorities to grant licences to im-
port filter cigarette-making machinery,
while such licences were for a long
period denied to British Tobacco, coin-
cided with earlier publicity that smoking
was a direct cause of lung cancer.
However, that company's vigorous
and appealing methods of marketing un-
doubtedly established filtertips, and
especially King Size filtertips, as a new
fashion among smokers in this country.
Without detracting from Rothmans’
achievement in taking over the position
of Australia’s largest cigarette supplier,
one cannot overlook British Tobacco's
determined counter-attack. The com-
pany has performed well in overhauling
its methods, catching up a lot of lost
ground, stabilising its position, and per-
haps starting to gain the upper hand
again.
There seemed to be a note of con-
cern, if not anxiety, about increasing
competition in the address delivered by
the chairman of Rothmans last Septem-
ber, and it must arise far more from
British Tobacco's “comeback” than
Gallahers’ entry into the Australian
market.
“This is a highly-competitive indus-
try,” Mr Irish told Rothmans’ share-
holders, “and one where size is
important. Rothmans starts with the
advantage that it is the largest cigarette
manufacturer in Australia. It is an
Australian public company, run by Aus-
tralians, but it also has the benefit of
very powerful overseas affiliations. We
are big enough and strong enough to be
able to fight any competitor in this
market.”
If size is as important as stated, Bri-
tish Tobacco must possess decisive ad-
vantages in point of resources at its
disposal. Assets owned by British
Tobacco totalled £sl million, compared
with £2O million owned by Rothmans
at last balancing date.
Shareholders’ funds were about £32
million for British Tobacco, compared
with about £7 million for Rothmans.
TV/leasured by total sales of tobacco
(including “roll your own”, pipe
tobacco and cigars, besides cigarettes)
British Tobacco is again a much larger
enterprise.
If nationality is important, British
Tobacco is no less Australian than
Rothmans.
If overseas affiliations also are import-
ant, one would be really surprised if
those of Rothmans were as powerful as
those of British Tobacco.
Mr Irish added the further interesting
information that Rothmans had “de-
cided to limit production and to restrict
the expansion of our sales” because
Australian leaf of quality grades was in
short supply.
The granting of excessive protection,
so that uneconomic expansion of Aus-
tralian leaf-growing is encouraged, is a
vexing problem for all tobacco manu-
facturers in Australia.
Doubtless, British Tobacco will wel-
come its rival's concern about this com-
mon problem, because the latter's
apparently superior lobbying ability may
help to overcome the long delay in get-
ting adjustments made to improve the
situation for consumers.
Shareholders have been asked to
forgo little despite the immense re-
adjustments, involving large expendi-
tures on new plant, that were necessary
to overcome the challenge from Roth-
mans.
Earnings reached a peak of about
£2,646,000 in 1959, when a 10 p.c.
dividend was paid by quarterly divi-
dends.
The dividend was maintained in the
following year, although earnings fell by
about £265,000 and it was only in the
1961 year, when they were then about
£720,000 below the peak, that the divi-
dend was reduced to 8 p.c.
With improved earnings, however,
9} p.c. was paid in 1962 followed by
restoration of the full 10 p.c. dividend
last year, although it is now paid half-
yearly instead of quarterly.
Such resilience in the results of a


BALANCE SHEET AND PROFIT SUMMARIES (£000)
company faced with a novel and serious
threat to its long-established market
position is an encouraging feature for
investors seeking income with security.
One tentatively adjusts the company’s
profit in 1962-63 to about £2,730,000, to
show a return on ordinary capital of
13.8 p.c. in the table below.
With more buoyant trading conditions
in the current year, it can fairly be
assumed that a new record for profits
will be shown, ensuring maintenance of
the dividend.
Disposal of a “substantial though
minority” interest in the company’s
printing and packaging activities to the
international Mardon group seems to
involve a revision of earlier diversifica-
tion plans, which were based on ex-
pensive take-overs.
However, it has helped to liquefy
finances immediately, and to reduce
future possibly large capital calls, while
preserving access to new techniques and
products.
Subsidiaries of the company have just
made a £1 million, or 32 p.c., invest-
ment in Dodge Consolidated.
Jn other respects Mr Foley reported
satisfactory progress, with the com-
pany “continuing to advance strongly,
even though conservatively, on a much
broader front than its earlier single
commodity operations”.
Pastoral activities, which are now
well-established, were “capable of grow-
ing into a significant factor in the com-
pany’s future”.
Further growdh and financial returns
were expected in the current year from
extension of the range of machinery
manufacture by American Machine and
Foundry Company (Aust.) Pty Limited,
despite problems in spreading the sport
of ten-pin bowling.
Criticisms frequently heard of this
company may perhaps usefully be venti-
lated. One is that, if investments such
as Naroo Pastoral Company Pty Limited
are so promising, overseas interests affi-
liated with the company should not in-
vest so much in them. They should be
reserved entirely for the shareholders.
The other criticism is that overseas
partners may have too much say in the
company’s policy and activities, because
the entire board consists of company
employees and there are no directors
with independent outside interests to
strengthen a purely Australian point of
view.
While the Australianism and compe-
tence of the existing full-time working
directors are beyond dispute, investors
here would undoubtedly feel more con-
fidence in the company if they were
joined by directors more directly repre-
sentative of the majority body of local
shareholders.
British Tobacco, I repeat, is just as
Australian as Rothmans and it is cer-
tainly more British, but such a change
in the composition of the board might
help this to become more widely appre-
ciated here.
Some mention should be made of the
series of anti-smoking campaigns stimu-
lated by publication of comments of
the Medical Research Council of the
United Kingdom in 1957, by the report
of the Royal College of Physicians in
London in March, 1962, and by the
recent report of the United States
Surgeon-General's Committee on Smo-
king and Health.
Mr Foley stated that the recently
published US report had had less ad-
verse effect in Australia on the sal? of
cigarettes than the publication of the
London report in 1957, while it has
been followed by a small increase in
the sale of pipe tobaccos and cigars, for
which the company was well prepared.
Statistical evidence linking heavy
cigarette smoking with cancer is as yet
far from convincing, because the ques-
tion of atmospheric pollution, which
may account for the wide disparity of
lung cancer deaths as between city and
rural dwellers and between UK residents
and those of less industrialised coun-
tries, has been the subject of inade-
quate research,
Mr Foley is in favor of increasing
the already large amount of research
being done to discover the scientific
truth.
“Selective filtration of various compo-
nents is a realistic goal, but it is first
necessary to discover and prove that
a particular component of cigarette
smoke is harmful.”
Realistically, however, his company
appreciates that “the avowed intention
of the opponents of smoking to con-
tinue these campaigns could, under the
present conditions of incomplete scien-
tific knowledge and illogical emotional
pronouncements, be a threat to the pro-
gress of the industry in the long term.”
Hence British Tobacco's steady ex-
tension into other fields of activity, the
results of which investors will note with
increasing interest.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Reward for Courage
National Consolidated ' s fine record
HHhe l-for-5 bonus issue by National
Consolidated Ltd has confirmed
once again the accuracy with which the
stock markets predict such events.
Five months ago during November,
1963 (between the announcement of the
year’s results and the annual meeting),
the shares were selling around 30s.
From then they rose fairly steadily to
375. 6d. at the end of February, 1964,
and, after weakening during March, shot
up to 395. 6d. early in April.
Investors who had the courage to buy
the shares 18 months ago at, say, 275.
including charges, could now sell their
shares and make a clear capital profit of
40 p.c. on their original total outlay.
The two preceding bonus issues were
both made in June a l-for-4 in 1956
and a l-for-2 in 1959. It may be only
a coincidence, but in the company's
fiscal year preceding the year in which
the bonus issue was made, the ordinary
dividend payout had been covered more
than twice by the earnings. This was
not quite the case in 1963, but would
have been very close to it if in earnings
we included the £20,000 which was
written back from provisions no longer
required and the capital profit of just
over £23,000.
In any event, the interim report of
two months ago seems to indicate that
the 1964 year would certainly have seen
the dividend payout covered more than
twice by the earnings. It was announced
that the earnings for the first six months
had shown an increase of 14.3 p.c. over
the corresponding period of the previous
year, but the directors cautiously said
“every indication exists that the 1963
after-tax profit of £1,032,671 will be
exceeded in the current year.”
As may well have been expected, the
profitability in the first years of the
1960 decade was not running at the
same level as the profitability in the
second half of the 1950 decade. Perhaps
it will be instructive to compare the
years 1960 to 1963 inclusive, with the
years 1955 to 1959 inclusive, using
some of the ratios given in the com-
pany's annual report (which is still one
of the best presented):—

4 12 10 3 15 11 9.8 8.5
4 1 2 N.A. 10.2 N.A.
There are a few interesting points.
For every year the “fixed assets earning
rate", which the company defines as
sales to fixed assets, shows a decrease on
the five years earlier. However, all the
other ratios show an increase with the
exception of the 1963 year compared
to the 1958 year.
It is also apparent that net profit as
a percentage of sales reached a peak in
1959 and from 1960 onwards has de-
clined steadily. However, it must not
be overlooked that the period from
1961 until last year has been a difficult
one. The company’s interest in the
automotive field was stated in 1961 to
have been gradually submerged “until
we can now claim that our prosperity is
no longer closely linked to the growth
or decline in this particular form of
activity.”
Tt must be assumed, however, that the
A Bearing Service Group and the
National Radiator Group are still very
dependent on the automotive industry.
A Press report of three months ago
stated that the group profit of the
Bearing Service (Holding) Ltd repre-
sented about 30.1 p.c. of the total profit
of the National Consolidated Group in
1963. It would appear from other
figures quoted in this same report that
in 1960 (prior to the acquisition of
HTC Pty Ltd, Eyelets Pty Ltd, RMS
Pty Ltd, Murfett Holdings Ltd and
A. Flavell Pty Ltd) the Bearing Service
Group contributed about 48 p.c. of the
total group profit.
There can be no doubt that as a
result of a number of takeovers, the
group has expanded very rapidly over
the last ten years. Shareholders’ funds
totalled approximately £442,000 at June
30, 1954, while at June 30, 1963, the
total was approximately £6,762,000, and
at June 30, 1964, the figure should be of
the order of £7.2 million 16 times
the 1954 figure.
This is without taking into account
any revaluation which may be necessary
to provide the reserves from which the
bonus issue will be made, since avail-
able reserves at June 30, 1963, appear
to total about £454,000, while the pre-
sent issue will involve £540,000 approxi-
mately.
Part of this increase has resulted from
the acquisition of subsidiaries which are
engaged in servicing the automotive in-
dustry, but another and quite substantial
part has been in diversification into
other fields.
While it could be said than an exami-
nation of past results is not much help
today because of the different nature of
the group's activities, one can only feel
that in a large measure the success of
the National Group has been due to
the management.
'C’rom all present indications there is
little doubt that the 20 p.c. dividend
rate will not be maintained on the bonus-
increased capital.
Over the long period from 1951 to this
year, however, the average annual rate
of increase in per share dividends has
been about 9 p.c. per annum.
This is a very fine record by any
standards and if this rate of growth is
continued for the next ten years only,
and thereafter falls to only one-third of
the current rate of increase, the effective
yield from the shares purchased today
at 395. cum the l-for-5 bonus issue, will
be just under 8 p.c.
While this return would be attractive
to the institutional investor who re-
ceives dividends virtually tax free, but
suffers tax on interest income, it may be
a little low for investors both private
and institutional who are taxed to the
same extent on dividends and interest.
I would judge that these investors pro-
bably were very happy purchasing the
shares at 30s. cum the bonus.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Borg-Warner’s Revival
US corporation demonstrates its confidence
HThe confidence with which Borg-
Warner Corporation of the US views
the long-term future of this country can
be judged by its substantial and increasing
investment in its Australian subsidiary
Borg-Warner (Australia) Ltd, differential
and transmission unit maker.
During the year to December 31, 1963,
the American company took up at par
284,952 10s. ordinary shares and 284,952
10s. 6 p.c. first cumulative participating
preference shares.
It now holds approximately 59 p.c of
the issued ordinary capital, and almost all
the preference capital (in three classes),
for a total investment of- some £2.3
million.
It was 1956 when the American com-
pany first bought an interest in the Aus-
tralian business, then operating as Coote
and Jorgensen Ltd. Four unprofitable
years had then been experienced.
Borg-Warner of Chicago initially in-
fused £1.3 million of fresh capital by
taking up equal amounts of ordinary and
first preference shares with an option to
take up further issues. Existing ordinary
20s. shares were written down to 10s. to
provide £756,500 for losses.
Under American control, the loss
position was eradicated in two years, but
the adverse economic conditions which
seriously curtailed automotive production
in 1961 provided another setback for the
company.
The revival in the motor industry and
determined efforts by the management
have put the company back on its feet.
In the 12 months to December, 1963,
pre-tax profit eased from £897,132 to
£818,007, but accumulated losses were
no longer available for tax relief, and the
actual fall in after-tax profit was more
marked.
After providing £295,000 (1962
£105,916) for tax and £268,359
(£256,763) for depreciation, the net
result on trading fell from £791,216 to
£523,007 profit. These figures do not
take account of a £991 capital loss in
1963 nor £60,740 capital losses and fixed
assets adjustments in 1962.
In 1962 all arrears on preference
dividends were cleaned up and a 3 p.c.
dividend paid on ordinary shares, after
seven and nine years’ omissions respec-
tively. From 1963 profit, a 6 p.c.
ordinary dividend was declared, which,
together with the year's preference divi-
dend, absorbed £175,533.
The trap in analysis of Borg-Warner "s
earning’s performance is that the first
cumulative participating preference shares
(all held by the American company)
participate equally with ordinary shares
in any dividend over 6 p.c. On the
average ordinary and first preference
capital in 1963, therefore, the profit
represented a return of 18.3 p.c.
The company has been whetting share-
holders’ appetites for years with talk of
producing an automatic transmission unit.
Arrangements are now being made to
produce Model 35 at the company’s
Fairfield (NSW) works.
This transmission is now used by BMC,
Rootes Australia, American Motor
Rambler, and in the Ford Zephyr Mark
111. Borg-Warner’s production will replace
imports. It is expected also to do busi-
ness with Toyota.
During 1963 £233,769 was spent on
freehold properties and £287,323 on
plant and equipment to prepare for auto-
matic transmission production, and to
increase capacity on existing lines.
A note on the balance sheet covers
£359,022 of plant and equipment on
order but not then paid for. Since
December 31, the board has authorised
additional capital expenditure of
£537,000.
Borg-Warner has climbed from a posi-
tion of enormous reliance on bank over-
draft to a cash position of £497,918 at
1963 balance date.
The company should be able to readily
obtain bank or other loan funds for its
expansion programme this year. The
American parent’s option to take up
shares expired on December 31, 1963,
and it is unlikely that there will be any
further enlargement of capital until the
company is on a more secure and
generous dividend basis.
The parent may be anxious before
lifting dividend above 6 p.c. to see the
automatic transmission venture success-
fully launched and all obsolete machinery
for other products fully replaced.
If the rate was advanced to 8 p.c. and
10 p.c. in the next couple of years, the
return from a current purchase at 30s.
would be only 2.7 p.c. and 3.3 p.c. re-
spectively. On the available evidence,
the immediate rewards to an Australian
investor are small.
On the other hand the obvious growth
potential in the Australian motor market,
the relatively small number of Borg-
Warner shares available, and the reputa-
tion of the American company will pre-
vent much weakening of the share price.
HOADLEY’S HOLDINGS LTD
Tasty Morsel for Hungry Giant
T iquidity of Hoadley’s Holdings Ltd,
Melbourne chocolate maker, has
suffered during its seven years rebuild-
ing programme, and directors are now
considering an increase in share capital.
This may not necessarily be a call to
shareholders, for the chairman (Mr J. L.
Hewison) in his 1963 address said the
shares held by the NSW subsidiary in
the parent could be sold at the market
premium or could be used for acquisition
purposes.
During the year to December 31,
Hoadley’s acquired a SA confectioner,

F. J. Boyle Ltd, satisfying the purchase
price by transferring some of the shares
in the holding company held by the
NSW subsidiary. This was equivalent to
allotting 58,500 ss. shares in the hold-
ing company at a premium of 9s. 4d.
a share.
The company, best known for its
Violet Crumble bars, Violet Milk
chocolates, Polly Waffles and Tex bars,
also makes a full range of confectionery,
and has had exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights in Australia for Swiss
Tobler chocolate since 1960.
Although dating back to 1913, the
company was not really on its feet until
1939. Exceptionally high earning rates
in the ’fifties induced a capital reorganisa-
tion in October, 1956, whereby holders
of each 3s. 4d. share were given three
ss. ordinary shares in exchange. Then
in November, 1961, the holding com-
pany was formed by exchange of three
ss. ordinary shares for each ss. share
formerly held.
Reconstruction of the Melbourne
and Adelaide factories and the Sydney
warehouse will be completed by mid-
-1964. The Adelaide subsidiary con-
tinues to be a good profit-earner, not-
withstanding prolonged difficulties with
the faulty floor of the factory.
Earnings in the years to December
31, 1963, accelerated from £68,543 to
£88,270, and from 18.0 p.c. on capital
to 22.8 p.c. The company was more
generous to shareholders, paying 7d. a
share (llj p.c.) compared with 6d.
(10 p.c.) from 1962 profit.
Turnover was better, thanks to im-
proved marketing and merchandising
methods and to general economic con-
ditions. The rebuilding programme and
policy of progressive plant replacement
made for more economical production
and stock handling.
Profit result for the year was still
below the 1959 record of £93,393, but
it can be assumed that this will be over-
taken soon. The trend so far this year in
turnover is promising.
Attention has been given to export
and chain store marketing, and all in all
the impression is gained that Hoadleys
can handle changing conditions very
capably.
As one of the smallest in the Aus-
tralian chocolate trade, Hoadley’s share
capital of 1,926,000 ss. ordinary shares
(of which 481.500 were held by a sub-
sidiary) and 75,000 8 p.c. cumulative
preference shares of 205., would be a
tasty morsel for any hungry giant.
Apart from intrinsic merits, the ss.
shares, which currently command a price
around 21s. 3d. to yield 2.7 p.c., also
have appeal on takeover grounds.
YORK MOTORS (HOLDINGS) LTD
Liquidity No Problem
"Release last February of the BMC
Morris 1100 is expected to boost
business for York Motors (Holdings)
Ltd, which handles BMC products in
the Sydney metropolitan area and in
Queensland. But motor trading pro-
fits in the three months from December
to February were less than in the pre-
vious year. Profit from the finance sub-
sidiary has, however, partly offset this.
The group scored a much better pre-
tax profit in 1962-63 than in 1961-62,
thanks to the Queensland subsidiaries
and the finance section. However, the
last year did not have any benefit from
tax losses of newly-acquired subsidiaries,
so the net after-tax profit advance was
not so great.
Net result of 1962-63 trading was a
profit of £192,274, after tax of £97,682
and depreciation of £24,380. It com-
pares with £185,507 profit, £58,213 tax
and £25,406 depreciation in the year to
November 30, 1962.
The group comprises Lancaster
Motors, Sydney metropolitan distribu-
tors of Austin, Morris and Wolseley
vehicles and Nuffield tractors; York
Motors, the NSW distributors of Rolls-
Royce, Bentley, Studebaker, Mercedes-
Benz and Toyota; Dominion Motors,
the Queensland distributor of Fiat cars,
Perkins engines and Holden tractors;
UK Motors, the Queensland distributor
of Rolls-Royce and Bentley, Austin,
Morris and Wolseley vehicles; Castle-
reagh Traders, the wholesale purchasing
subsidiary; and Rosebery Investments,
the hire-purchase subsidiary.
Toyota operations began on May 1,
1963, thus contributing to 1962-63 pro-
fits for seven months. The NSW
Peugeot franchise was dropped on
April 1, 1964.
Since 1960-61, when BMC com-
menced direct vehicle distribution
through Sydney dealers (and Lancaster
Motors thus lost substantial business),
York Motors has had a surplus of
funds.
The sale of the old hire-purchase sub-
sidiary, Glasgow Investments Pty which
financed sales to dealers, also released
considerable funds. (The present finance
subsidiary assists the group’s own retail
sales.)
The group has been anxious to re-
place lost business, and to this end in
1961 took over Peter Lloyd Ltd, the
Sydney co-distributor of Morris and
Wolseley vehicles and a State-wide BMC
parts distributor. The Mercedes-Benz
franchise was obtained in January,
1962, and the Toyota, as mentioned,
last year.
In April, 1962, £453,333 was paid
back to shareholders, reducing ss. stock
units to 2s. 6d. par value.

During 1962-63 stocks increased from
£1.7 to £2.2 million to meet the in-
creased sales, including Toyotas. Bank
overdraft was extended from £213,024
to £763,296. The £600,000 in interest
bearing deposits held on November 30,
1962, was reduced to £250,000 a year
later.
The net increase of £115,376 in fixed
assets was the result of new building
and reconstruction projects to premises
in William Street, Sydney, Rosebery,
Parramatta, Blacktown and Chatswood,
as well as in Brisbane. Any excessive
liquidity left should be mopped up by
extensions and improvements to pre-
mises in the current year.
On the halved capital, a dividend of
25 p.c. was paid from an earning rate
of 42.4 p.c. in 1962-63. A price of
9s. 6d. for the 2s. 6d. units gives an
income yield of 6.6 p.c. and an earnings
yield of 11.1 p.c. This is considerably
more liberal than the 4.7 p.c. and 8.1
p.c. available from the Melbourne BMC
distributor, Lanes Motors Holdings Ltd,
and makes York shares quite an
attractive income proposition
YATES SEEDS LTD
Yates Sound but Unexciting
any capital profit from
the sale of fixed assets, it is evident
that the year to February 29, 1964, was
not the easiest trading period Yates
Seeds Ltd had ever encountered.
The abnormally adverse weather in
Sydney in the autumn of 1963 was the
chief cause of the troubles, although
directors also mentioned that there was
some pressure on gross profit rates which
they were able largely to offset with
reduced expenses.
The earning rate eased from 19.7 p.c.
to 18.6 p.c. as net trading profit declined
from £61,154 to £57,535, after pro-
viding £35,531 (1963 £41,372) for tax
and £22,758 (£21,757) for depreciation.
The business of wholesaling and re-
tailing seeds is long-established, although
it was not listed on Sydney Stock Ex-
change until 1951.
In 1959 Arthur Yates and Co. Pty Ltd
acquired Guy Yates Pty Ltd which had
specialised in the distribution of agricul-
tural seeds and pasture grasses.
The group now has a home garden
division, handling packet seeds, fertilisers,
dust and sprays for the home gardener,
an agricultural seed division, and a bulk
garden seed division producing vegetable
seeds for market gardeners.
Garden chemicals were introduced to
the range in 1958, and include Gro-Plus
fertilisers.
Headquartered in Sydney, Yates has
a 25-acre research farm and laboratories
at Castle Hill. Branches exist in Mel-
bourne and Brisbane, and an Adelaide
branch will be opened in May. A
Townsville branch was established in
1963-64 to supply seeds for tropical pas-
tures being used increasingly in North-
ern Australia.
Overseas affiliation was arranged with
US plant breeders Northrup King and
Co. in 1963-64. Flybrid material will
be produced commercially in 1965.
Directors say that sales continue at a
high level, and they are cheerful about
long-term developmental prospects and
earnings capacity
Disposal of properties in Brisbane and
Dundas (NSW) eased dependence on
bank advances from £216,638 in 1963 to
£115,679 on February 29, 1964. Loans
on mortgage were extended from £13,200
to £53,075. A balance of £70,000 was
still owing to Yates from the sale of a
property in the previous year.
The company’s financial structure is
sound. Revenue reserves of £271.13®
and capital reserves of £4375 support
paid capital, all in ordinary shares, of
£309,618.
A one-for-five bonus was made in
April, 1962, from revaluation of shares
in a subsidiary. A repetition is unlikely
under present conditions for some years,
and so is a cash issue.
The company has never paid more
than its current dividend rate of 12i p.c.,
and because of the unpredictability of
seasons it would be unwise to set a
higher pace.
For what is primarily an income stock
a yield of 4.8 p.c. is quite fine enough.
A seller is offering the 20s. shares at
525. and finding no takers, although the
shares are rarely available. Maybe he
will have to come down to attract a
buyer.

IMPROVED RESULTS: GROUP ASSETS
EXCEED £lOO MILLION
New era for controlled expansion at home and overseas. Mr E. G.
Spater reports on momentum for continued success and greater
profitability.
The Annual General Meeting of Lombard Banking Limited will be held at the
Dorchester Hotel, London. The following is an extract of the circulated
statement of the Chairman, Mr E. G. Spater, F.C.1.1.:
Last year I made it clear that the Executive
was confident that the final stages would soon
be reached in our policy of consolidation. The
results for the year ended 31st December, 1963,
dispose of the final phase of this period and
introduce a new era of further controlled ex-
pansion and development both at home and
overseas.
Profits Doubled
We promised better results for the year under
review and this we have achieved. We regard
them as a step towards even better results in
the future.
Group total assets have been re-established in
excess of £100,000,000. The Operating Profit
was £1,748,000 (1962 £1,076,000) an improvement
exceeding 50%. Profit before taxation was
£1,298,000 (1962 £601,000). The Net Profit,
after tax, shows a substantial increase at
£637,000 (1962 £184,000).
Dividend Forecast Exceeded
An Interim Ordinary Dividend of 5% (1962
2V 2 %) was paid in October 1963, with an
undertaking that not less than 7*4% would
be recommended as the Final Dividend. In
the event, we have exceeded our forecast and
are recommending a Final Ordinary Dividend
at the rate of 12y 2 %, making 17y 2 % (1962 10%)
for the full year. No effort will be spared
to better these results for 1964.
Liquidity
The Bank’s Balance Sheet shows Cash and
Balances with Banks, Money at Call and Short
Notice of £15,376,000 (1962 £11,888,000). This
provides a liquidity ratio of 29% and gives
material strength and flexibility to this Banking
Institution. Current, Deposit and Other Ac-
counts stand at £53,050,000 (1962 £45,234,000).
This increase, mainly in the form of Deposits,
is a most pleasing indication of public con-
fidence.
SUMMARISED POSITION
The position as at 31st December, 1963:
Total Assets up to £107,699,000
(an increase of 18.5%)
Deposits, etc. up to £60,738,000
(an increase of 12.8%)
Advances to Customers up to £86,522,000
(an increase ox 16.5%)
Liquid Reserves up to £16,618,000
(an increase of 24.1%)
This improvement in the Group’s position
introduces a momentum for continued success
and improved profitability. With the knowledge
gained from the results for the fh'st few months
of the current year, your Directors anticipate
that 1964 should prove to be a good year for
Lombard Banking.
HOME SUBSIDIARIES
Lombank Limited achieved better results for
1963 and has deservedly earned the highest
reputation as a leader among the National
Finance Houses; this is a position which will
be maintained.
Other Subsidiaries engaged in credit finance
enjoyed a successful year and those subsidiaries
specializing in the finance of Domestic applian-
ces. radio and television succeeded in restoring
full activities and re-establishing profitability.
OVERSEAS SUBSIDIARIES
Lombard Australia Limited. We are indebted
to our Chairman in Australia, Mr Lawford
Richardson, FCA, for assuming executive re-
sponsibility for the intensive reorganisation of
Management and Policy referred to in last
year’s statement which was successfully com-
pleted towards the end of the year.
We welcome Brig. The Hon. S. L. M. Eskell,
M.L.C., to the Board of Lombard Australia as a
non-executive Director. He joined us during
1963 and has considerable knowledge and ex-
perience in other realms of Finance which are
complementary to our own in Australia and his
presence, advice and guidance in the Board
Room of this subsidiary will undoubtedly lend
strength and wisdom to tne conduct of our
affairs in Australia.
During the year the issued ordinary capital,
all of which is owned by the Bank, was
increased to £A3,000,000. Your Directors have
great faith in the potential of Australia and
are confident this increased investment will
prove most rewarding. Our colleagues concern-
ed are to be congratulated on all that has
been achieved so successfully to re-establish the
Management and Profitability of Lombard Aus-
tralia Limited.. It is our sincere belief that an
excellent future is assured. The name and
reputation of Lombard Australia had reached
a new high lev_el throughout Australia and
we are confident that akin to Lombank in the
British Isles, Lombard Australia is recognised
as not the biggest but one of the best National
Finance Companies in Australia.
Business now being effected in all States is
most satisfactory both in volume and, of more
importance, quality. Profitability has been
firmly re-established and in company with our
colleagues in Australia we are convinced that
1964 will prove the commencement of a new
era of success and profits in Australia with
consequent benefits to the Parent Bank in
London.
Lombard New Zealand Limited. Operated
throughout 1963 as a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Bank. The results for the year measured
up to expectations and provided appropriate
dividend to the Parent Bank. Your Directors
are unanimous in their conviction that that
Company will enjoy another successful and
profitable year in 1964.
Lombank Canada Limited. Progress has been
maintained and slowly but surely this sub-
sidiary goes from strength to strength. We have
increased our investment in Canada through
a new subsidiary and we believe that our
companies there are equipped to increase pro-
fitability substantially, with consequent in-
creasing contributions to Lombard Banking in
future years.
Other Subsidiaries. Our Swiss subsidiary pro-
vided an increased, dividend. We reduced our
interest in Lombard Bank Lebanon S.A.L. to a
minority proportion and disposed of part of
our interest in Lombard Banking (Cyprus)
Limited. Although that Company is most
successful and profitable our limited interest
there is being closely watched.
THE OUTLOOK
The individual successful results reported to
you indicate that well before the close of the
year each subsidiary in the Group was operat-
ing profitably and there is every good reason
to believe that these subsidiaries will achieve
improved results by the end of 1964.

Big Question Mark on Wool
Moves to close down small selling centres
VTot only is Wool Board chief Sir Wil-
liam Gunn a most astute man —he
is also lucky. And who would say that
of the two attributes the second is of the
lesser importance?
Sir William was out of the country
when the balloon went up within the
past fortnight on the subject of moves to
close down the small wool selling centres
throughout Australia. The subject is by
no means closed. Indeed it is likely
to be a thorn in the side of Sir William
for a good while yet.
One report had it that he was on a
holiday. Another that he was on his
way to the United States as one of the
group of people being sent by the Aus-
tralian Meat Board to represent Austra-
lia at the inquiries later this month into
the vexed question of Australia’s access
to the US “hamburger” meats market.
Probably it was a case of a bit of
each. On a holiday abroad, Sir William
would doubtless make himself available
in time for the Washington talks.
The whole business started with a
Press statement by the Leader of the
Opposition in Victoria, Mr. Clive Stone-
ham, that there were behind-the-scenes
moves going on to close down Portland.
Now Portland is a very special topic
in Victoria. It took four years of active
campaigning, plus some in-fighting, to
get it established as a wool selling centre.
More than that, it is the shining proof
that decentralisation is not just a word
in the State.
The brokers only recently showed that
their early opposition, on the grounds of
costs, was withdrawn. Three very im-
portant brokers, Dalgety-NZL, Elders-
GM and Australian Estates, announced
plans for extensive building operations
at Portland.
Mr Stoneham challenged the Premier,
Mr Henry Bolte, to state his Govern-
ment’s attitude to the renewal of anti-
Portland propaganda.
Mr Bolte did. But it was not the
brokers this time who were against Port-
land. It was, very surprisingly, the Aus-
tralian Wool Board.
In any case, said Mr Bolte, he was
not going to “have a bar of plans to
sabotage Portland” by the Wool Board
or anyone else. Portland was going to
be a success and by next year might be
handling up to 200,000 bales.
With this kind of assurance, Portland
seemed pretty safe. But it was to be
made very clear that Portland was only
one of a number of the smaller selling
centres under a cloud. The others:
Albury and Goulburn in NSW, and
Ballarat in Victoria.
Significantly these are inland selling
centres and when the head of Australian
Estates, Sir Denys Lowson, announced
the plans for his company’s development
at Portland some months ago, he said it
was “rather generally agreed” that only
seaboard selling centres had a sound
future.
In Canberra, Mr Malcolm Fraser,
who represents the area in which Port-
land is located and who has been one
of the leading lights in the development
of wool selling there, asked the Minister
for Primary Industry, Mr Adermann, if
the Wool Board did in fact want to


MODERNISE YOUR
‘FLOATING ACTION’ garage door fittings
From Hardware stores everywhere t.ibs/z
close down Portland, Albury, Ballarat
and Goulburn.
Mr Adermann replied that the Aus-
tralian Wool Industry Conference would
consider all aspects of marketing, includ-
ing the case for small centres, when the
Wool Board's Marketing Committee pre-
sented its report.
This report is expected in July.
AH this was, to say the least, not very
satisfactory. The lid was lifted properly
by a Mr Alex McLennan, who is a vice-
president of the Victorian Wheat and
Woolgrowers’ Assn and a soldier settler
at Beaufort (Vic.).
Mr McLennan is regarded as one of
the up-and-coming boys in his organisa-
tion. On occasions he is alarmingly
frank. He revealed that some time ago
he had attended a meeting, by invitation,
at which Sir William Gunn was present.
Others included his association’s secre-
tary, Mr J. B. Bryant, the president of
the Victorian Graziers’ Assn, Mr R. C.
Webb, and a former president, Mr C.
Bake well.
Mr McLennan said that Sir William
had told this gathering that the Wool
Board did not want to see smaller wbol
selling centres set up.
Both he and Mr Bryant had “express-
ed disgust . But, said Air McLennan,
the two Graziers’ Assn men, AJessrs
Webb and Bakewell, had been prepared
to co-operate with Sir William.
This brought a stinging reply from
Air Webb. He said that Air AlcLennan’s
description of what was a “lunch-time
discussion' with Sir William was in-
accurate. He added: “It is not my in-
tention to breach a confidence.”
The Wool Board's reply came from
the acting-chairman, Mr A. N. Arm-
strong, who is a top executive of the
Commonwealth Banking Corporation.
He said that the Board in its market-
ing investigation was examining the ade-
quacy of selling centres and it hoped
there would be no major expenditure in
selling centres until the marketing report
was completed. In the case of Portland,
however, the Board had advised those
woolbrokers concerned that they should
proceed with their plans there.
Once again it appears from this that
Portland is off the hook, but little has
been said about Albury, Goulburn and
Ballarat.
The immediate reaction by many
woolgrowers was to link the woolbrok-
ers with the Alarketing Committee of
the Wool Board. Some growers alleged
that the two groups were plotting to-
gether to overthrow the small centres.
But in this particular instance, regard-
less of what their attitude may have been
in the past, this allegation might be un-
fair to the brokers. Indeed, it appears
that, for Portland anyway, there is a
division amongst the brokers now with
quite a number regarding it as a better
long-range bet than even Geelong.
Any discussion on the small wool sell-
ing centres involves local patriotisms and
emotions. For this reason Sir William
deserves some sympathy. No matter
how sound your logic, when you start
talking about closing down any country-
town industry you lose friends. Like-
wise, your enemies have ready-made
ammunition provided for them.
The full report of the Marketing Com-
mittee, when it comes out in July, should
be a best-seller. It is considering the
merits of the following systems:—
• The present free auction system
and any modifications thereto.
• A reserve price scheme within the
auction system.
© An acquisition scheme.
• A central appraisement scheme.
The majority of growers would
appear, in general terms, to favor the
reserve price within the auction system.
But, then, wool is a peculiar industry in
that the majority of growers do not
produce the most wool.
There is a “top 14 per cent” who
produce about half the total wool clip
and, moreover, the bulk of the top-
priced wool. Amongst this 14 per cent
would be the big pastoral companies who
are both owners of wool properties and
brokers of wool.
Whilst allegations of some kind of
‘'plot" between the pastoralist-brokers
and the Wool Board's Marketing Com-
mittee may be wide of the mark, it
nevertheless follows that the Marketing
Committee must, if it does its job
properly, consider well the views of the
‘'big boys”. After all, small as they
are in numbers, it is the “big boys” who
produce most of the wool.
If a Marketing Committee report sug-
gesting drastic changes in the present
system of market were imminent, the
pastoralist-brokers probably would be
very concerned. If they are, it is not
showing in their current behavior or in
their shares where such are listed on the
stock exchanges.
On the surface one might assume that
drastic changes are most unlikely. This,
of course, ignores the majority of
growers, six-sevenths to be exact, who,
medium or small, nevertheless have com-
mitted themselves to a fourfold increase
in the levy for promotion.
They made it very clear to Sir William
Gunn and the Wool Board that they
would agree to the increased levy only
if big changes in marketing were forth-
coming.
If Sir William were, in fact, enjoying
a holiday, few would deny that he de-
served it. He will need to be in full
harness in July when the Marketing Re-
port comes put.
The NT Isn’t for the Small Man
Cold logic of northern development
Who says the spirit of adventure is
** dead?
Get out the station wagon, buy a
Digger hat and a safari type jacket from
the nearest disposals store, and set out
for Darwin. Any service station will
provide you with a map. You will then
be able to experience the joys of explo-
ration without having to dig for water as
did Burke and Wills.
They perished, poor fellows. You
won't. You will be able to inform your
friends and acquaintances, upon your
return, of the “untold riches, the vast
unexplored wealth, and the limitless
potential” of the Northern Territory.
If you are any hand at all at writing
you should get some space in a metro-
politan newspaper and, if you can take
movies, you might even crack it on TV.
But you had better do it soon be-
cause, apparently, those scoundrels, the
“vested interests”, are going to criss-
cross the Northern Territory with
barbed wire fences and Keep Out
notices.
This seems to be the reaction to the
remark by the Minister for Territories,
Mr C. E. Barnes, that his department
might “sympathetically” consider appli-
cations by NT cattlemen to convert their
leaseholds to freehold.
Already critics have accused Mr
Barnes of attempting to “sell Australian
heritage to English and other companies'’.
But, just for once, let us try to look at
the Northern Territory without senti-
ment and in the light of cold, hard
logic. If we are accused of debunking
the North, then perhaps it is high time
some debunking was done. As a cattle-
producing region it barely counts.
It had one million cattle 50 years
ago, and today it has about the same.

They are not even good cattle. They
are pretty lean stores of the old-time
Shorthorn type that has not been seen
in southern regions, or Queensland for
that matter, for years.
For some extraordinary reason the
average city dweller thinks of the North-
ern Territory as “the real cattle coun-
try”.
Of Australia's beef cattle, Queensland
has nearly six million, NSW has three
million, and Victoria about li million.
The NT has about the same as Victoria.
But when dairy cattle are counted —
and a good proportion of these are used
for crossing to produce animals slaugh-
tered for beef we find that Queens-
land has, in all, seven million, NSW 41-
million, Victoria three million and West
Australia one million.
As a percentage the NT runs a mere
seven per cent of the nation’s cattle.
In the last six years the American
boneless trade has proved to be the
greatest thing that has happened to the
Northern Territory in 50 years. The
lean beef this trade needs is the one
kind the NT can produce.
Provided the operations are con-
ducted on a big enough scale, and pro-
vided also that the market continues, the
NT cattle industry looks as if it just
might pull itself out of the doldrums.
Obviously freehold titles would help.
To sink large amounts of money into
NT cattle ventures, Australian as well
as overseas investors want some kind of
security. Banks, it has been said, do not
like lending money where leaseholds are
involved.
There are many thousands of young
Australians who, given the chance,
I would gladly take up farming. But
setting them down in the Northern
Territory would not be giving them a
chance.
This is big country and it needs big
operators with capital of at least
£500,000. There are many areas in
the south where closer farming is pos-
sible, and it is in these regions that new
settlers would have brighter prospects
on much less capital. Eventually as
the big operations move ahead there
might be room in the North for smaller
farms providing additional farm pro-
ducts.
The place needs to be got into gear
and at this time it is the big properties
which have the best chance of doing
that. It should be obvious, too, that a
series of big cattle stations making
worthwhile profits would create a work
opportunity of a much wider nature
than at present exists in the North.
It is worthwhile looking at the history
of American cattlelands—the real stuff,
not the Hollywood Western variety.
Until World War I the cattle industry
in the American west was largely
controlled by absentee English and
European (Dutch mainly) companies.
They might be likened possibly to
Vesteys, King Ranch, and the other
absentee companies operating in the NT
today.
In the course of time and to be
sure two world wars helped the hold-
ings of these companies gradually were
sold off to Americans and the era of
foreign control passed.
There would very likely be more
chance for young Australians to eventu-
ally own cattle stations in the NT if the
absentee combines were permitted to
develop what they have there as fast
as they can.
As soon as the price of the land
makes it worthwhile they would be vir-
tually certain to sell off portions. The
price of the land merely reflects the
money that can be made from it, and
as it stands now the individual Austra-
lian “having a go” would not stand a
chance.
Let us have a look at what it costs
today to start up a modest cattle station
in the NT. Let's say 1000 square miles
capable of carrying eight cattle to the
square mile.
Bores would cost £20,000 with up-
keep of £25 a week. Fencing might
come to £12,350. A homestead would
cost £5500 and with other essentials the
new property, before stocking, would
cost £50,000.
It might be stocked with 1000 cows
for £20,000 and they would be pretty
cheap cows at that.
First year’s operating costs might be
£ll,OOO and after seven years, provided
there are no droughts and the cows
calve well, a profit of some £3OOO
might be expected.
Better and this is the tragic thing
really to put the initial £50,000 into
hire-purchase and give the kids a good
education.
All right then. Why not big Govern-
ment investment? Government invest-
ment in farming, in marginal areas par-
ticularly, has a habit of coming unstuck.
Think of the Ground Nut scheme
after the war. And, more recently, of
the failure of the new wheatlands in
Russia. If Socialist Russia makes a
mess of it, what chance have we?
No. Government money can be
much more wisely spent in such things
as mining, ports, industry, etc. Govern-
ent help is a different thing.
Science, it is said, will make the NT
into a wonderland. It might, too, but
not next year or the year after.
In the meantime, giving the big cattle
companies the kind of help they need
most, at no real cost, might get things
moving.
But just because it is the Northern
Territory and therefore different is an
idea that needs to be dropped. Why is
it different to any other part of Austra-
lia? Why should it deserve any different
treatment?
Nothing, of course, is likely to con-
vince those Australians who have been
to the NT just once that it is not differ-
ent. This excludes those practical
cattlemen who have taken a look and
who have left quite content to leave it
to Vesteys and the rest.
This being the case, perhaps what the
NT really needs is a Las Vegas. That
way all the hoo-ha and the boasting
might be channeled into a revenue-pro-
ducing enterprise.
