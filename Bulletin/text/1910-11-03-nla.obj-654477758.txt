THE RED PAGE
Maurice Hewlett
Hewlett is one of the few living English
writers with any measure of greatpess, and
a critical examination of his work by a com-
petent man would have some value. An
American named Milton Bronner has
attempted a review in a little book, Maurice
Hewlett, published by J. W. Luce, of Bos-
ton. His criticism is not very penetrating,
and the best part of the book is the sum-
mary it gives of Hewlett’s work to date.
Maurice, born in 1861, grew up in a favor-
able atmosphere, and the first of “ the books
which influenced him ” was the Morte
D’Arthur. “Asa lad, he was supposed by
his fond family to beable to imitate anybody.”
Like Stevenson, he imitated sedulously while
making a style of his own, but his first
publication, Earthwork Out of Tuscany , is
mostly Hewlett—a fresh, nervous and vivid
English in which he makes the reader feel
something of the character of medieeval
Italians. Botticelli dominates the book, and
Hewlett adopted a plan, afterwards elabo-
rated, in which he introduces the painter in
more or less imaginary episodes. There is a
pagan appreciation of life and a romantic
flavor in this book which were more pro-
nounced in the next— The Forest Lovers, a
tale in the manner of William Morris.
You may define romance as the portrayal
of life as one would like it to be, realism—
life as it is. J ohn Davidson said 1 ‘ Roman-
ticism bears somewhat the same relation to
romance that sentimentality bears to senti-
ment.” In The Forest Lovers there is more
romanticism than romance.
Little Novels of Italy is an advance in style.
There is one excellent story and the rest are
studies such as a full-blooded Pater might
have written. There is a “little novel” in
a later book —“ Buondelmonte’s Saga ” in
Fond Adventures —which has more life in it,
though Milton Bronner omitted to notice it.
Bronner may be agreed with in his appre-
ciation of The Queen’s Quair, Which succeeds
as a chronicle novel, while Richard Yea and
Nay fails “ because of its divided purpose
and its divided story.”
Mr. Hewlett’s Quair is a nineteenth century
masterpiece, which need fear no comparison with
the historical novels of his great predecessors.
Women have always received very careful
and sympathetic handling in Hewlett’s novels.
They are generally aristocratic dames, loving
like the Patient Grisel or Meredith’s Aminta.
Says Bronner :
In the main, Hewlett’s women are good women.
They are loyal and loving, ready alike to take
beatings or kisses. There is no ice in their
bosoms which must needs be thawed.
Hewlett’s women are so near to flesh and
blood creations (his Queen Mary being more
convincing than any other portrait of that
much debated character) that the charge of
“ fleshly ” was naturally made against him by
the Puritans. He replied :
The characters in my novels are. men and women,
and when I see them doing things which men and
women do—kissing and marrying as well as pray-
ing and fighting, I say so, and make no bones. I
have never in my life been suggestive for the sake
of lust and never prurient. But Ido not see why
I should leave out one-half of life when I am
writing for men and women who are alive.
Of course, that does not excuse him to people
who ar,e only half alive. Criticism of that
kind may not have frightened him; but he
was probably influenced by the assertion that
he could not write romantically of people of
to-day, and in reply he published Halfway
House , a comedy of manners in the Mere-
dithian style.
The principal interest of Halfway House
is in Senhouse. This gipsy philosopher (a
mixture of St. Francis, George Borrow and
Stevenson), fascinated, as Bonner says, “ be-
cause tire author has left things unsaid.”
Senhouse appeared again in Open Country ,
preaching anarchic simple-life theories to
Sanchia Percival, whom he worshipfully
loves as the incarnation of the chaste goddess
Artemis. The letters, admirable in them-
selves, were heavy freight for a story ; still
the personality of Senhouse carried the story
through. Rest Harrow (Sydney Book Club)
brings Sanchia and Senhouse together again
and destroys them.
The Beatrice ef this comedy.is almost too
wonderful, and her reasons for marrying Sen-
house (according to their own rites) would
pass understanding, if women were reason-
ing creatures ; but the liatless, long-haired,
hatchet-faced, sandal-shod artist, tinker and
gentleman has become impossible. Hewlett
made the mistake of saying too much about
him and leaving nothing to the reader’s ima-
gination. He could not make such a highly
romantic character live in a modern setting.
If thrown back for a he would
be more feasible. The matter-of-fact per-
sons who fill the minor parts are well drawn,
and there are, as in all Hewlett’s work,
passages of fine prose and good philosophy.
William De Morgan has made the same
mistake of departing from his proper period.
The Affair of Dishonor (Dymock’s) takes
place in the seventeenth century, and is a
dull story. It should never have happened
again.
Mr. Ingleside (Dymock’s), like Over Bem-
erton’s, is an excuse for E. V. Lucas to dis-
play some extracts from forgotten books.
The story is next to nothing ; the characters
are oddities, faintly sketched ; but there is
joy in quotations such as this from A Thou-
sand Notable Things :
Rain in the stomach. Put thirty white pepper-
corns in your mouth and drive them down with
beer.
And this, from one of the delectable novels
of Mi;'s. Ros :
As Delina’s hurried steps spake farewell with
a crackling speechlessness to the pebbled avenue
on which she so often trod the blackening ball of
sorrow rose within her heaving breast, and as its
invisible body clambered to the narrow summit it
burst asunder with a sickening sound, scattering
its dying echo around the misty hedgeway along
which she passed. She heard not the sound, she
felt not the force of her tread, her sorrow was so
illimitable.
There is much rtiore of tlie same kind,
besides a few new letters of Lamb’s, and
some of Lucas that is well worth reading.
The Happy Moralist is a good title for
the latest book by Hubert Bland (Werner
Laurie). His name is a perfect fit—Hubert,
the gay man about town, and Bland, the
urbane, well-ripened dispenser of philo-
sophic pills with sugar coating. The latter
may do some good, and the former will
amuse. Once he met a tramp who honestly
owned up to the fact that work of any kind
was abhorrent to him. This made him think
of the idlers who live on rents :
It is odd, isn’t it, that while “ how to eliminate
the dregs ” is always a problem for the social re-
former, so few thoughtful persons ever trouble
themselves about the at least equally urgent ques-
tion, how to get rid of the scum ?
On the cultivation of catholicity:
The only reading that is at all worth while is
discursive; worth while, I mean, from the Art of
Life point of view.. .. My advice in the matter
of literature is—browse freely amongst books, rifle
a library as you would rifle a garden; confine
yourself to no author, to no subject, to no cen-
tury. .. . Extensity rather than intensity should
be our rule in the cultivation of our preferences.
On Ibsen and Shaw:
Now Ibsen’s people do things, unconventional
things, things which society holds to be immoral
even ; and to the doing of which it attaches social
penalties. Mr. Shaw’s people talk about them —
and stop short at talking.
The Nobel peace prize for 1910 has been
awarded to Tolstoy. Under Nobel’s will five
prizes are awarded annually—(l) for the
most important discovery or invention in
physical science, (2) chemistry, (3)
physiology, (4) “to the person who has pro-
duced the most remarkable literary work of
an idealistic tendency,” and (5) to the one
who has done most in the cause of peace.
Each prize is worth about £BOOO. Tolstoy
is over 80, and the money can’t do him any
good.
Lawson
One does not judge a bark humpy by
the laws of architecture which apply to a
cathedral. Each may be picturesque, bub the
Higher Criticism should be left outside while
you examine Henry Lawson’s The Skyline
Riders and Other Verses (Fergusson & Co.,
Sydney). The author tells his friends at the
beginning of the book that— .
These are soups that were mostly rejected—
Bat songs»from my heart.
And the introduction, “an unconventional
sketch by J.G.L.,” puts the critic in his
place :
What does it matter whether a man here and
there thinks that Henry Lawson, or any other
writer, is past his prime? The final court of
appeal, after all, is “the man in the street” or
the man in the bush. What he fancies, he will
have. ... It is enough for him to know that his
favorite wrote the poem he is doing his best to
commit to memory. Against this sort of thing
criticisms do not count.
Naturally, they do not count, for which
reasoii “The Wil'd Colonial Boy” once
raged through the bush, and appears even
now in remote fastnesses. It is hardly
necessary to say that the bush and street of
to-day are not the final courts of appeal, nor
is it necessary to remind readers that in the
days when the world was wide Henry Law-
son wrote While the Billy Boils, which has
in it some of the stuff that endures.
There are lines here and there in this
new collection which recall the strength of
the early work, in “The Song of Prison,”
and “Cromwell” particularly. “A Bush
Girl” is a companion picture to “Past
Carin’ ” :
She reads by slush lamp-light, maybe,
When she has dragged her weary round,
And dreams,of cities by. the sea
(Where butter’s up sb much the pound),
Of different men from those she knows,
Of shining tides and broad, bright streams,
Of theatres and city shows,
And her release ! She has her dreams.
The Skyline Riders is only a humpy, but
it contains a man much bruised in his fight
with the world. Here is one whose eager-
hearted youth was filled with the nascent
spirit of Australia, who put some of that
spirit into words which have had a vital in-
fluence and will have a lasting value; and,
because of that, anything he does has some
interest to Australian readers.
Few writers have been more frank about
themselves. If anything, he has told too
much and complained too often. It is a pity
that he did not follow his own advice to
~ ~ #
Other writers: . . ■
Think not of the hours we wasted in “oblivion
foully won,.
Or the bitter cups we tasted. Let us work that,
when life’s done.
We shall have, in bush or city, shaped our future
course so true
That they’ll say “ It is a pity—they had so much
more to do.”
Whatever may be responsible for the fact
that his life has not been “a success,”
according to the ordinary standards of the
world, it is not want of appreciation in his
own country.* He has had more of that
than most men, and, with pathetic egotism,
he flourishes the fact that “I have dined
with earls,” and in this booh—
Ah ! little did the teacher dream
That one of us, perchance,
Might write in London to be read
In Germany and France.
At any rate, lie is sincerb. He puts all of
himself in his work—his follies, his aspira-
tions, his love of Dickens and the smell of
fried fish ; his strength and his weakness,
Lawson, as he is now, is in this book— The
Skyline Riders.
Some Other Australians
The hand of Ethel Turner has not lost its
cunning. Two books of hers arrived shortly
after Mrs. Curlewis herself returned from
England. Fair Ines is one of her breezy,
healthy stories for girls, in which the char-
acters are unconventional and have a few
ideas to spare. There is a Philistine, for
instance, who considers that paintings, like
books, should be made for cheap reproduc-
tion, and no original should cost more than
half a guinea. Then you could change the
pictures on your walls as frequently as you
change your novels at the library. The Haft
in the Bush (Sydney Book Club) is made of
an animal extravaganza which should amuse
little children, and some of the material,
illustrated by D. H. Souter, which used to
brighten the pages of The Town and Country.
Lilian Turner’s Three Neaxhum Girls is
more likely to suit English readers than
Australians. The newchums are lively,
quite proper and well connected, and the
story is of the orthodox kind.
The World’s Tragedy and other Poems, by
Gilbert White, Bishop of Carpentaria (printed
at Thursday Island) —a collection of tame
verses on orthodox or uninteresting subjects.
The bishop, who is a far-off relation of the
Gilbert White, of Selborne, answers the
scoffers by pointing to-the sunset:
Answer, ye wise men, my question—
Whence comes a beauty so kind ?
Lavished on moorland and ocean,
Means it aught else but a mind ?
Words may mean much or mean nothing,
Arguments fail thus or so ;
Little I reck of their trending,
For I have seen, arid I know.
Arguments fail thus, certainly. The words
of the savage who hears the voice of his joss
in the thunder would mean just as much if
expressed in the same way.
A modest booklet of Poems by W.B. W.
(M. West, .Sydney) offers what the author
believes to be a new reading of some old
fables—the Garden of Eden, the Tower of
Babel, etc. There does not seem to be any-
thing new in W.R.W.’s speculations, save,
perhaps, in these lines summing up the
works of the poets from David*down to
Shakespeare :
These were fictions, fancy’s flights,
Over old Parnassus heights ;
High upon old Sinai
Or Olympus in the skv ;
Where Jehovah sat with Jove
And with poets fables wove.
If there be any of you who. have hopes of
the Waratah, give them up, for A. Styan
Dendy has sunk her a thousand fathoms deep
in The Loss of s.s. Waratah and Other Poems
(G. Robertson and Co.) :
Seas upon seas her decks o’erwhelm.
Prayerful and steady. Ready ? Ay, ready !
Chief on the bridge ; man at the helm.
Slowly she flounders, deep down she founders.
0 southern swell ! O southern swell !
Praise, praise for the joy that with Christ they
dwell.
These “poems’’are, according to the preface,
“shafts swift from my slender skill ... to
bear these burdens of my minstrelsy. So
may dull hearts be cheered, or, vexed calm
tempered be.” Precisely.
Printed sermons, as a rule, ale so much
pap ; but Henry Howard put some strong
meat into the fare served out in his Adelaide
church. Published as The Summits of the
Soul (Culley, London), they are commended
to the flabby brethren and those who pant
heavily after the dollar. This is the Rev.
Howard’s opinion of the fatter :
I would infinitely rather take my chance in the
hereafter with the man who has burnt himself out
with strong drink, or destroyed his body and
brain in sexual excess than with the man who has
trampled on his brother men and sister women,
and made his ears deaf to the children s cry for
bread in order to slake his unhallowed thirst for
gold. If there be no hell, then one ought to be
created for such a brood; if there be, then for
them its nethermost abyss is not too deep.
The Sydney Municipal Library has got
into line with the best libraries by placing
new books on shelves open to the public.
It is an. advantage to be able to walk round
and dip into a of volumes before
deciding upon one to read. Since C. H.
Bertie took charge the library has been
rapidly getting up to date. Members now
have a chance of getting recent scientific
and technical works and good "cneral
literature.
Readers are reminded that “ The Best
Ten” competition closes on November 10.

your choice.
A number of reviewers in England and America
assert that George Meek , Bath Chair-man: by
Himself, must have been written by Wells, and
that the introduction over his own name is one>of
those devices which are intended to give a closer
air of truth to a piece of make-believe. Letters
signed by H. G. Wells and George Meek have
appeared in which the assertion is denied. .. .
Defoe often committed the venial sin of false pre-
tence, and passed off fiction as fact; but it would
not have been worth while for Wells to pose as
George Meek. Every man has at least one story
to tell—the story of his own life, and there are
many who have read Wells and could write in
somewhat similar style. Few would be honest
enough to say much against themselves, orsimple-
mmded enough to record “the things that no
one tells,” as George Meek has done.
Some American Verse
LOVE TRIUMPHANT.
Helen’s lips are drifting dust,
Ilion is consumed with rust;
All the galleons of Greece
Drink the ocean’s dreamless peaces
Lost was Solomon’s purple show
Restless centuries ago;
Stately empires wax and wane—
Babylon, Barbary and Spain—
Only one thing, undefaced,
Lasts, though all the worlds lie waste
And the heavens are overturned.
1 —Dear, how long ago we learned !
There’s a sight that blinds the sun
Sound that lives when sounds are done,
Music that rebukes the birds,
Language lovelier than words,
Hue and scent that shame the rose,
Wine no earthly vineyard knows.
Silence stiller than the shore
Swept by Charon’s stealthy oar,
Ocean more divinely free
Than Pacific’s boundless sea, —
Ye who love have learned it true.
—Dear, how long ago we knew !
Frederic L. Knowi.es.
RANK AND FILE.
You might have painted that picture,
I might have written that song :
Not ours, but another’s, the triumph,
’Tis done and well done—so ’long !
You might have fought in the vanguard,
I might have struck at foul wrong :
What matter whose hand was the foremost ?
’Tis done and well done—so ’long !
So ’long, and into the darkness,
With the immemorial throng—
Foil to the few and the splendid :
All’s done and well done—so ’long !
Yec, as we pass, we will pledge them—
The bold, and the bright, and the strong,
(Ours was never black envy) :
All’s done and well done—so ’long !
Edith M. Thomas.
A LYRIC.
Grey rocks and greyer sea,
And surf along the shore—
And in my heart a name
My lips shall speak no more.
The high and lonely hills
Endure the darkening year—
And in my heart endure
A memory and a tear.
Across the tide a sail
That tosses and is gone—
And in my heart the kiss
That longing dreams upon.
Grey rocks and greyer sea,
And surf along the shore—
And in my heart the face
That I shall see no more.

FEARS.
Mrs. Parkinson, of the Bundemar Hotel, Trangie, writes
about this great Nerve Remedy, Clements Tonic, thus:
/ wish to inform you of benefits derived. I suffered much from
indigestion. No medicines did me good. Your tonic, of which I
took a course of eight bottles, cured my ailments. I was run down,
I c ? uld not eat or sleep, had pains all over, did not care if I lived or
died. I could not sit behind a horse for nervous fears. Now I
can drive a trap and pair. We keep an hotel, and my customers
remark what a DIFFERENT WOMAN I AM, and I tell them I
have to thank Clements Tonic for the good it did me.
“ (Signed) FRANCES N. PARKINSON.”
Various professional persons recommend this tonic because it is pregnant with
those properties which rebuild the constitution. Nurses associated with some of the
largest institutions in the Commonwealth have written in terms of appreciation of its
beneficial effects upon convalescent patients. That it helps Nature to regain her
strength is undoubted.
This testimony shows what a health-restorer this medicine is, and what years of strenqth and
health anaemic women may enjoy through its use. It relieves biliousness, sick headache, weakness
low spirits, loss of appetite, poor blood, wasting diseases, constipation and indigestion. It lenqthens.
women’s lives, and gives them years of happiness. All chemists and stores sell it in Australia.


Do
You
Want
y\*A
Long, Heavy Hair?
Then treat your hair well. See
that it is properly fed. Growth
of every kind demands proper
food. Starved hair splits at the
ends, turns prematurely gray,
keeps short and dry. Then feed
your hair. Feed it with proper
food, a regular hair-food. Feed
it with Ayer’s Hair Vigor. Thus
help nature all you possibly can
toward giving you rich, heavy,
luxuriant hair. Ask your doctor
about your hair and about Ayer’s

Injury to Insult.
Twas folly to hope that you’d know me,
As humbly I bowed by the kerb,
A shabby and'sorrowful scarecrow—
And you in a motor superb.
I couldn’t expect you to see me,
Nor snobbishness should I impute,
When you’re in a thousand-pound motor
And I’m in a thirty-bob suit.
And yet, as I stood by the gutter,
And you hurried by looking so grand,
I thought that as soon as you saw me
You’d smile and, perchance, wave your hand ;
But now that I think the thing over,
I looked a most woe-begone brute.
There was you in your thousand-pound motor ;
There was me in my thirty-bob suit !
I thought p’raps you’d think of the old days
When I used to take you around
(I usen’t to think it worth while then
To wait for the change of a pound).
Ah ! you have gone up in the world since,
While I have come down with a scoot,
Now you’re in a thousand-pound motor
And I’m in a ready-made suit.
I’d hate you to think I’m complaining—
It’s all just a matter of luck,
That now you are up with the leaders,
While I have dropped back to the ruck ;
But really it did make me angry,
And bitter and sorry to boot,
As you, in your thousand-pound motor,
Threw mud at my thirty-bob suit.

St. Kilda Sands.
The ti-tree blooms at Sandringham, beside the
cheerful sea;
From Melbourne’s streets by train and tram the
laughing lovers flee !
Beaumaris lifts her scarlet cliffs above the swing-
. irig tide.
And gleaming sails of distant skiffs on sapphire
waters glide !
The Brighton cars go clanging past/—methinks the
glad sea-shore
To lovers true who hurry fast seems Heaven’s
opened door;
’Tis Paradise they surely- seek —blown hair and
clasping hands,
And lips that kiss and softly speak, upon St.
Kilda’s sands !
Who is St. Peter? Surely he who takes the
lovers’ fare,
What time they hasten to the sea—away from
Mammon’s lair !
; He is the lord of Heaven’s gate, and they shall
enter in f
With shining eyes and souls elate—drab Judkins
calls it Sin !
But fat St. Peter at the gate—he smiles a friendly
smile
At Flinders-street, where lovers wait their “little
bits of style”!
A woman comes, with glowing eyes. ... St. Peter
understands;
And lovers find their Paradise—upon St. Kilda’s
sands!
The sanded beaches all invite, and wave-beats
seem to say :
“Be ye as one with God to-night—soon comes
the busy day ! ”
And shining eyes and lips that kiss, perchance,
more holy are
Than holy souls that sting and hiss, and live to
spoil and mar !
God gives man refuge from these pests, that sadly
moan and bray 1
And girls are God’s own thankful guests all round
the singing bay !
Let Judkins blare in distance dim, what time
their happy hands
Lift Pleasure’s cup with jewelled rim upon St.
Kilda’s:sands!

As It Was in the Beginning.
As it was in the beginning, so we’ll find it in the
end,
For a lover or a brother or a sweetheart or a
friend;
As it was in the beginning, so we’ll find it by-
and-bye,
When weak women hug their babies, and strong
men go out to die.
As ’tis written now, or spoken, so we’ll find it yet
in deed ;
For their State or for their Country, for their
Honor or their Creed ;
For the Love of Right, or hatred of the Ever-
lasting Lie,
When the women think of somethings, and strong
men go out to die.
As it used to be in past times, in the future so it
must,
We shall find him stretching forward with his
face down in the dust;
All his wounds in front, and hidden—blood to
earth and back to sky,
While pale women pray in secret, and strong
men go out to die.
Rebels all, we are, and brothers, rebels to the
laws we make.
Rich and poor, or fat or lean man, fighting for
another’s sake.
It is all as God decreed it, we shall find it by-and-
bye—
When our girls, disguised in boys’ clothes, go to
die where strong men die.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tiik Bulletin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy." Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
.officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.
Special Notice.
Insufficiently stamped letters are liable to be refused.
The contents of this paper are copyright by the pub-
lishers. The right, to reproduce or translate any part of
the contents of this number is hereby expressly reserved by
the publishers.
The Editor will carefully read and, where practicable,
acknowledge in the “ Correspondence ” column all contri-
butions submitted, whether in the form of Political,
Social, or other Articles, Verse, Short Tales or Sketches
(those dealing with Australian subjects, and not exceeding
twe columns in length, or, say, 3000 ivords, are specially
acceptable), Paragraphs, Letters, or Newspaper Clippings.
All communications ivill be regarded as strictly confi-

THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 3, 1910.
THE WHOLE FINANCIAL ANIMAL.
This paper has on various occasions and on
various subjects urged the Labor party—State
and Federal—to go the Whole Hog, and in the
ana neuei.u s . ’ ,
matter of the anti-loan policy it arises to tender
the old counsel once more. (The reason why
The Bulletin doesn’t harass the “ Liberal ”
party with similar advice is that the case is hope-
; ~ , , fi,£.
less; that futile institution o e
Hog, but it never goes it.) The complete animal
above alluded to is one that isn’t gone nearly so
often as it should be. The essence of politics is
too often compromise, and more than half the
time it is needless compromise. The Whole
Hog is in most cases as easy to go as the
half one, and not infrequently it is easier;
also in almost every case it is more creditable.
But timid politicians fancy that the mere section
of the pork-creature must be simpler and safer
because there is less of it, and by reason of that
idea the time-server suffers eclipse and the affable
place-holder goes to the wall or the Devil. In the
matter under discussion the State Labor party of
N.S.W. is an anti-borrowing party with limita-
tions. It reserves the right to raise loans for the
completion of public works already in hand ; also
it reserves the right to borrow for new works pro-
vided they will pay interest on their cost and 1
per cent, sinking fund. Everything else is to be
charged to revenue. That is the Half-Hog—a
very creditable specimen of its kind, but still not
the spacious total carcase it might be.
* * * *
The compromise which the Labor party has
made is unfortunate in various ways. If the pub-
lic works already in hand are completed with loan
money, it will seem to imply that the McGowen
Government couldn’t complete them otherwise.
That will, of course, suggest that, whenf the policy
of paying for the bulk of railways, etc., out of reve-
nue really starts, there will be mighty few works
compared to those of the old days. If it is pos-
sible to go at anything like the old pace without
borrowing, the way to prove it is to start right
now. The works now in hand will take some
years to complete, and if they are paid for
with Cohen’s money it will be quite a while
before .the Labor Government will start to be
seriously different from the old gang that it dis-
placed. In fact, it may be thrown out of office
before it begins to be seriously different. In
other words, if it doesn’t start now to prove the
feasibility of its policy of paying out of revenue
for all works save those that will return full in-
terest and 1 per cent, sinking fund, it may go out
of office without proving it, and its chance may
not come again for years. Should it go out of
office with its opponents shrieking that it was an
incapable and faint-hearted crowd and dared
not put its own methods to the proof, the
accusation will certainly help to keep it out of
office. From this day onwards the “Liberal”
gang will be busy assuring the man on
the land that because of Labor’s anti-borrowing
or modified anti-borrowing policy there will never
be any more railways or roads or bridges or har-
bor works or anything else. It will presently
begin to recapture votes by that cry, and the only
way to stop the process of recapture is to disprove
the tale. The proviso which authorises borrowing
for works already in hand might be a necessar y
precaution, for no one could tell how many works
a falling Tory Government might not leave in
hand ; but it would be a great mistake for the
party to avail itself of this loophole.
* * * #
There are also elements of misfortune about the
scheme for borrowing for the construction of
works that will pay interest and 1 per cent, sink-
ing fund. There are so many ways, especially in
“ Liberal ” finance, of computing the revenue from
any kind of public work that the idea lacks defi-
niteness. It might hardly allow a conscientious
Government to borrow at all, while it might enable
a conscienceless Government to get a loan of half
the earth. No one really knows in advance what
income any railway, for instance, will yield, and
if a line Was once debited to loans under the real or
assumed impression that it would pay its way, and
it didn’t pay its way, there would be a great temp-
tation to simply pass an Act of Indemnity
on the plea that the unfortunate thing
was done, and might as well be allowed to
pass. Or the thing might be simply let slide
without even an Act of Indemnity. There
would always be complications about the new
loan railway which paid per cent, in a
good year, and thereby justified its existence and
its I O U, and then struck a drought and fell to
the rank of a 2| per cent, proposition, and became
wholly illegal. And there would be other
difficulties. The Labor party’s proposals are an
improvement on anything in the past records of
N.S.W., but they are not so great an improve-
ment as they might be.
* * * *
The Labor party presumably wants to make
the return of its enemy to power as difficult as
possible. One way to do that is to show it up as
an incompetent and profligate ass, which failed to
see that borrowing was a quite unnecessary
feature of a strenuous public works policy, though
the fact was obvious to the brighter intelligence
of its opponents. That would make it certain
that the Wade party will only return on one of
two conditions—either with the acknowledgment
in its mouth that it is reduced to adopting its
opponents’ financial policy, or with the disgrace
of being the hog that went back to its wallow.
If the Labor Government declares for straight
anti-loan methods, it will thereby gain a stupen-'
dous advt. in the British press ; and it would be
gall and wormwood to “ Liberalism ” to see J.
Bull giving Labor his unqualified blessing as the
only capable financial authority N.S.W. had ever
possessed. And, then, if “Liberalism” returned
to its old job and its old ways the air would be
thick with the clod of Bull’s denunciation, and
the average “ Liberal ” has such a profound re-
gard for British opinion that this would greatiy
undermine its position. No worse damage could
be done to an incompetent gang of Tories than
to show up its only device, dodge or standby
as a busted superstition. It would reduce
that gang to the status of a chased cat in a treeless
land, or a circus showman whose only animal is
dead.
# * * *
As regards ways and means, the position is not
so difficult as might be supposed. In the first
place, the present absurd “sinking fund” could
be suspended, which would make some £450,000 a
year available. The Wade policy was to create
anywhere between £1,500,000 and £3,000,000 of
new debt with one hand, while paying off £450,000
of old debt with the other, and a party which in-
curred no new debt, and ceased, at least
for a time, to pay off old debt, would
be a great deal better than Wade. The
act would be the more justifiable, as the
Commonwealth has acquired the power, which it
must exercise some day, to take over the State
debts, and when that is done it will provide its
own sinking fund. The Closer Settlement Fund,
which is alleged to have absorbed £1,000,000 in
the year which ended at June, 1909, could also be
closed up. The purpose of this fund is to buy
back, often at absurd prices, large estates, and cut
them up into small farms, without any precaution
whatsoever against the formation of other big
estates to take the place of those that have van-
ished. The Labor policy is, or should be, to
repurchase nothing, but to compel the great
monopolists to cut up and sell their own big
estates, and if the Federal progressive land-tax is
not heavy enough to do the work, it can impose
a State tax in addition. Some extra money can
be got in by restoring certain small imposts which
the late “Liberal” Government abolished in its
hunt for popularity, and by levying a betterment-
tax. There are also possibilities of economy here
and there; one notable saving would be the
avoidance of that needless litigation in which
Gregory Wade revelled, and another would be
the abolition of the Upper House. It might be
impossible, even with all these resources, to keep
up the tremendous pace which Wade’s Public
Works Department set during the last year
or so, but it would certainly be possible
to more than keep up the pace of the first
six years of “Liberal” administration. And the
position would get easier every year instead of
more difficult; for when £1,000,000 of revenue is
spent on a railway which returns 2 per cent, net,
the Treasury has a clear gain of £20,000 a year
with which to build new works ; while, if the same
work is built with money borrowed at per cent.,
it has a dead loss of £15,000 a year —the amount
it has to pay to gild old Hebrews. It is already
reported that the McGowen Government will be
confronted with a motion of censure when
Parliament assembles. If it meets Parliament
with a Bdl for the Abolition of Borrowing, the
staggered Opposition will at least commence its
censure under difficulties. It will pose as the
party which is so fond of debt that it tries to
prevent the Government even explaining how the
old pawn-ticket can be dispensed with.
THE TEMPORARY CAPITAL OF
AUSTRALIA.
Now that the Federal territory has been taken over,
and the site of the capital of Australia fixed irrevocably,
the question of railway communication becomes one of
importance.— Strenuous yelp in Sydney Telegraph last
week.
It probably made the gods laugh, if the gods take
in the daily papers—there is something so large
and gaudy about the assurance of the penny rag
that the Yassberra job is really “irrevocable” at
last.' Few things in this world are irrevocable, and
even such historic capitals as Nineveh and Baby-
lon, and Memphis and Moscow, and Delhi and
Susa, and Sardis and Sparta, and Tirzah
and Jezreel, also Milan, Florence, Damascus
Naples, Corinth and Carthage became unfixed in
course of time. There is at least one thing to
be said for the Yassberra city—accord-
ing to the assurances of its warmest sup-
porters it is never likely to be more than
a small, movable sort of place—a pocket or duo-
decimo metropolis—and it won’t cost so very
much to shift it when Australia gets tired of the
shameless fraud that has been foisted upon it.
For, some day, Australia will realise that the
only continental capital on earth ought to be
something better than a little unprogressive coun-
try town, such as its own advocates declare
that Yassberra is destined to be. The story of
that weird place has been about the most unclean
record of treachery and scoundrelism in Aus-
tralian politics. It had its origin in that act of
political spieling by which the N.S.W. Parlia-
ment repudiated its agreement with the other
States, annulled the people’s acceptance of the
original Federal Constitution, and refused to goon
with the movement it had inaugurated unlessit was
specially bribed by the promise of the capital.
The tale progressed along the same lines when it
was decided to reject the site which the Federal
Parliament’s own expert declared to be the best,
because if it was accepted it would open the fine
closed port of Twofold Bay, contrary to the
narrow-souled doctrine that no deep-water port
must be allowed in N.S.W. save Sydney. Then
came the gradual exposition of the theory of the
petty insects who hate Australia —that the con-
tinent should have a mean, paltry hencoop of a
capital so that it might not overshadow any State
metropolis. And out of that was evolved the
choice of a small barren site without coal or water
power, lying away from any main line of railway,
with a Federal “port” about 100 miles distant
from the city—a small “port” that stopped short
at high-water mark to prevent any shipping com-
ing to it except by the permission of the State
Government; a “port” with a petty area that
made no allowance for water supply, and
held on a shaky title because it is inside
the prohibited area. The wonderful capital site
is located in the driest region in all the coastal
and tableland district of the State. It hasn’t the
slightest prospect of being a great manufacturing
centre. It isn’t expected to have any commerce
of its own —in fact, it was selected chiefly
because it lies in a region the commerce of which
has already been secured by Sydney. It is in a
locality which, in an agricultural and pastoral
sense, has long been on the down grade. The
reasons for its existence are the policy of dragging
all N.S.W. population to Sydney and its environs,
the policy of keeping ali rival ports closed, the
policy of keeping the empty regions still empty,
the anti-Australian policy, and the policy of
holding the Federal city under the press domina-
tion of the Tory morning papers of Wade’s State
capital.
# * * *
There has not been one clean or noble senti-
ment in the whole wretched Yassberra business.
It has been alleged that the interests of N.S.W.
required the capital to be there; that N.S.W.
wouldn’t staud it anywhere else ; that faith would
be broken with N.S.W. if it was placed anywhere
else ; that any attempt to place it anywhere else
was a “Victorian conspiracy”; that (this was
Prime Minister Fisher’s tale) it was really “a
very small matter ” ; that the place lay in a Labor
electorate and its selection would help David
Hall to retain his seat; that Freetraders were
bound to vote for it because Reid and Cook were
for it ; and that it wasn’t worth while to acquire
the undying animosity of the Sydney morning
press by voting against it. But among the whole
blatant crowd which helped, in one way and
another, to push the evil-smelling business
through, this writer doesn’t know of one who had
the courage to say that he regarded ’Berra
as the best available site in the interests
of all Australia, or as a place which was likely to
be the seat of a city worthy to be the unique
capital of all history—the metropolis of a con-
tinent. There are professing Democrats in the
Government which is to-day strenuously pushing
along the ’Berra fraud who have declared over
and over again that they don’t believe in the
fitness of the place, and who are, therefore, con-
victed out of their own mouths of betraying the
interests of their country; and there are profess-
ing Tories who help them for the openly avowed
reason that they think Australia should have a
humble bucolic political centre, and they reckon
this one will be about humble enough. If there
are actual believers in the place—believers,
that is, from a large Australian point of view—
they are strangely silent. Prime Minister Fisher
has said that the thing didn’t matter, and Minister
O’Malley has treated the subject with clownish
jests, and other Ministers have made feeble
apology on the pretence that “ they regarded the
business as settled ”; but these things are not
exactly whole-souled advocacy.
The Yassberra trouble, as a matter of fact, isn’t
ended by a very long way. Theoretically it may
be possible to nail the capital down there; prac-
tically there is no nail long enough. The very
precautions which are being taken to make the
place small and obscure will also make it easily
removable. A capital like Paris or Berlin doesn’t
shift much; a mere blackfellow’s metropolis can
be moved from place to place almost at pleasure.
There will be no Customs house or arms factory
or cannon-foundry or Government clothing fac-
tory to shift from Yassberra, for the place isn’t
fitted for either trade or manufactures. The place
isn’t likely to be moored to its site through
the Federal port at Jervis Bay having become
the great naval base of Australia, for every
precaution is being taken to ensure that the
Federal area at Jervis Bay won’t be big enough
for a naval base. There will be no need-for a
great, costly Government House at Yassberra, for
the place is so near to Sydney that the Governor-
General can hangout there; so that will be one
less article for removal. The Treasury work will
be mostly done at the great banking centres —
Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide; no
one even professes to believe that Yassberra will
grow into a great financial centre. Nor is it likely
to grow into a great railway centre when
tiie lines become Federal property, for it
doesn’t seem to lie on the main road to any-
where. Of course, the people and papers of
Yassberra will clamor when a removal, is
proposed ; but then every effort is being made to
make sure that the people will be very few and
the local papers of very small account. Also,
every effort is being made to create a dull, tenth-
rate capital, of which even the most ardent
Yassberra-ite politician will grow deadly tired.
The place will depend for its existence partly on
the immense influence of Sydney ; but the Closed
Ports can’t be kept closed for ever, and Sydney
can’t always preponderate as it does now. It
will depend partly on the idea entertained in
Sydney that the trade of the capital will be of
immense value to it; but, foolishly enough,
every effort is being made at the same time to
make the capital a place which will have no
trade of any great value. Also, it will de-
pend on that clause in the Constitution which
says that the capital is to be in New South Wales.
But then Unification and Reconstruction are
plainly coming, and then there will be no more
Federal Constitution and no more New South
Wales. The Commonwealth won’t require a
Constitution in the early future, for it will have
all powers save such as it chooses to delegate, for
so long as it pleases, to local Legislatures; and
the existing States will vanish completely in the
new subdivision of the country. Sooner or later,
and more likely sooner than later, Yassberra will
have to exist solely on its merits as the place in
all Australia that is best fitted to be tne most
wonderful capital in the world the one
really continental city. Aud quite a number
of its advocates admit with amazing frank-
ness that they support it because of its lack
of merits—because, as they say, it is never likely
to be more than a country town or large village.
So apparently it will have just the same chance of
permanently holding its position as Frankfort had
in Germany, or Winchester in England, or Scone
in Scotland. They were all Yassberras in their
way, and each of them lost its billet because it
wasn’t big enough for it.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Further Evidences of Insanity.
Ever since the appearance of the proposals for
handing over control of trade and industrial
legislation to the Commonwealth the Tory papers
have danced a doleful jig about this “ conspiracy
to destroy the legislative power of the States.”
They have leaped a little higher than usual, as
they declared that nothing of the kind was “con-
templated ” when the Constitution was adopted,
and they have whirled a little faster than ordinary
when they stated that the inclusion of State rail-
ways under Federal industrial law will “give
the Commonwealth control of the lines with-
out the responsibility of financing or manag-
ing them.” (This, after all, is not so very
remarkable ; the State industrial and other laws
put every local grocery or bakery under State
control without the responsibility of financing or
managing it,” so the innovation which thus
alarms the local Tory is really quite an ordinary
business, and has been so for a long while.) The
latest form of words re this matter is that the
Commonwealth is “strangling the States,” and
the Tory press views the situation with alarm, as
one who looks out of a window and finds the
smiling landscape covered with fantods. ,Tlie
aforesaid press, being a wooden-headed institu-
tion and one of this country’s great arboreal
resources, seems to be quite sincere in its belief
that it is the States, and that when it objects the
States object. Its position is amazingly humor-
ous. The Federal Parliament does not propose to
take a single power or right or privilege from the
State authority; it only proposes to ask the
people, who are the States, if they would like to
take certain powers from their own State
authorities and hand them over to their own
Commonwealth. If they don’t feel so disposed
the matter is ended ; if they do, that is their own
affair. It is no hole and corner business, like
Wade’s Coercion Act, or the fixing of the Yass-
berra capital site. The matter is left entirely to
the people —who are the States—to decide, and
it is a very blatant Tory rag which denies the
people’s right of self-government at this late date.
Yet the Sydney Telegraph and Herald, and
their kind, are crazy enough to do it. The first-
named broke out last Friday in wild statements
about the iniquity of “filching” State powers
—i.e., the iniquity of the people stealing certain
rights from themselves in their State capacity and
handing them over to themselves in their Federal
capacity. Also, it thundered that the States
“federated under a clearly worded compact
which guaranteed them certain rights and pro-
perties,” and professed to regard it as an outrage
y that the States should be allowed to vary the bar-
gain they made with themselves if they think it
desirable to do so. This absurd pose of the Tory
press, as the authority which decides whether the
people shall be allowed to govern themselves or
not, begins to suggest actual insanity, possibly com-
plicated by an unwise selection of drinks in the
stomach. Itisthe theory of thedi vine rightof kings
in a new development—the divine right of inkpots.
Plainly and definitely Toryism lays it down that
self-government is the stealing of something or
other from somebody, and that, if the people
decide their own course of action by a popular
vote, it is a gross outrage committed by them on
parties unknown—presumably upon themselves.
Apparently they are going to be in the position of
the man who bit his own ear. The case is one
which calls either for cold contempt or medical
inspection.


The Bill Wade Left Behind Him.
“ Henry Horsecollar ” writes :
Just as soon as the McGowen Ministry settles down into
its stride it ought to take stock of the stupendous •
horse that its predecessors created in the shape o
Railway and Tramway Superannuation Fund, and le ■
the official doorstep in Macquarie-street, Sydney,
matter is urgent, for no one really knows how large
liability is or how much bigger it may be growing eieij
day. If the case is even half as disastrous as it promise,
to be, then Parliament should hastily enact that trie
scheme will only apply to the men now in the service (it
can hardly be abolished in their case without straining
public honesty rather hard), and that it will not apply to
men who join the service in future. Further, the Legis-
lature should levy a special tax —a Wade Pension ax-
on large incomes to meet the liability, and it should
appoint a Royal Commission to interrogate Wade, and
ask him on oath how he came to do the incredible thing.
During' the recent electoral campaign one of the Tory
rags which supported the “Liberal ” Premier expounded
the exact nature of the situation as follows :
“For Ninepence a Week.
“ The benefits to railway and tramway men under the
superannuation scheme passed by the Wade Government
are as follows :
1. A pension at the age of 60 after 10 years’ service.
2. A pension at any age after 10 years’ service if in-
capacitated. ,
3. Gratuity at any age with less than 10 years ser-
vice if incapacitated.
4. A special gratuity to an officer of anj 7 age if forced
to retire through bodily injuries received in the
course of his duties.
5. Refund of-contributions on voluntary retirement
before reaching pension age.
“For the Widow.
1. Where an officer dies whilst in the service his
widow or family is entitled to the refund of the
contributions made by him to the pension fund.
2. If an officer who has retired oil a pension dies
within six months of retirement, a special pay-
ment is made to bis widow and family.
3. If an officer is forced to retire owing to bodily
injury received in the course of his duty, and dies
before the gratuity is paid, the money will be
handed over to his widow and family.
“ This is the most liberal superannuation scheme in the
world, and the contribution is only 1J per cent, on the
amount of wages.
“ For example, a man whose wages are £2 10s. a week,
can secure all these benefits by the payment of 9d. a
week.”
Put shortly, the man who serves 40 years (from age 20
to age 60) at an average wage of £2 10s. a week will pay
to the fund £7B. Then he will proceed to draw a pension
of £B6 13s. 4d. per annum (two-thirds of his average
pay) for life, and the expectation of life at GO,
when you average the case of the man who dies
at 60£ and the man who lives till 95, is about
13J years. So the State is to receive £7B, and pay out of
it about £ll4O. A fairly liberal life office would charge
10 times as much for the same benefits. The fund is also
to make a special payment (amount unspecified) if the
pensioner dies during the first half-year of his retire-
ment, which will aggravate the position. Then in the
case of the man, who enters the railway service at 20 and
retires at 40—on an average wage of £2 10s. a week, he
will have paid £39 into the fund, and he will start to
draw £43 6s. Bd., which, according to the ordinary ex-
pectation of life he should collect for about 25£
years, so he is to get about £llOO in exchange for
£39. A good life office would give the same annuity to a
man of 40 for a lump sum of between £7OO £Boo.
Even allowing for all possible assistance through the
accumulation of compound interest the Wade fund seems
to be offering its benefits at one-tenth of their cost and
throwing in expensive frills to boot.
As a commentary on this remarkable business, the Maori-
land Government has just devised a National Pension
Scheme, by which the citizen who joins at age 20
is to pay Is. lOd. per week (not 9d.), and the one
who conies in at age 35 is to pay 4s. 6d. ( not 9d.),
and the one who comes in at age 45 is to pay 9s. lOd.
(not 9d.). And the Maoriland scheme simply provides
for pensions at the age of 60 ; it doesn’t proiniie a large
annuity after payment of 9d. per week for 10 years, or
allowances for incapacity, or special gratuities, or any
special grant in the case of the man who dies immedi-
ately after he reaches the retiring age. Yet the Maori-
land Government, for the very much larger payments
above mentioned, and with no frills or extras, only
promises £52 a year at 60, not £B3 16s. 4d., and even then
it is reckoned that the State will have to subsidise the fund
to the extent of 25 per cent. Wade’s affair is truly, as the
Tory paper so aptly remarked, “the most liberal super-
annuation scheme in the world.” There is nothing else
that dimly resembles it except the “Jubilee Juggins.”
The possibilities are so vast and varied that is difficult to
sort them out, but it looks as if a raving political lunatic,
in his haste to buy popularity, had let the Treasury in
for a possible bill of anything up to £19,000,000 as regards
the present railway and tramway staff alone. The new
Government ought to ascertain in haste where it stands
as regards this crazy business, and the first step towards
that end should be the appointment of a committee of
experts with power to summon Wade and Waddell, and
to demand explanations. For if this fund is right, every
other one on earth is wrong, and every life assurance
office in the world is a drunken fraud, or a circus, or a
boiling spring, or any old thing.
♦
An Urgent Appeal to Premier McGowen to
Climb Down.
The clamor of the N.S.W. Tory press against the
McGowen Government’s policy of leasing instead
of selling State lands has become so terrible that
it might be a wise act to make some slight con-
cession. It is often good to hold a candle to the
Devil, so long as it isn’t held so close that the
animal is maddened by hot grease falling on him.
Every morning the Tory dailies assure McGowen
that every man who cultivates a bit of land
has inside him, along with his food, a
natural and heaven-sent craving to own the
freehold of his own little farm, and if that
is so it is time to temporise. Probably the
best idea would be to give every tenant who rents
pastoral or agricultural land from a private land-
lord the right to compulsorily purchase it up
to 7 a certain area at a moderate price-
price to be fixed by an independent State
authority. (That would do for a beginning, and
the system might be afterwards extended to allow
people other than tenants to compulsorily pur-
chase private land which is not in use.) Of course,
the new occupant-freeholder might become a
landlord in his turn; but then his tenant
would have the same right of compulsory pur-
chase, so the old evil—the cultivator’s lack of
the freehold —about which the Telegraph
and Herald lament so bitterly, would be
at least greatly diminished. There would then
be two principal classes of N.S.W. cultivators:
(1) Private freeholders who cultivated each his
own bit of soil; (2) State tenants, each of whom
would be to some extent his own landlord, as he
would form part of the State which owned the
land. The utterly hopeless class of non-free-
holders —those who have no interest at all in
the land they occupy —would practically vanish,
and that result would fill the Tory press with
joy. Papers which insist that the ownership of
the freehold is man’s natural and Heaven-devised
condition simply must feel glad when the evil
they denounce so severely is hit hard on its
worst spot. If there is one class of tenant who
wants the freehold more than another, or
more than two dozen others, it is the
private landowner’s victim, for he generally has a
high rent, short lease and hard conditions, whereas
the State tenant has a long lease and easy
terms. Besides, it is absolutely necessary to
begin with the private tenant, if the freehold
is to be secured to the occupier at all.
When the State sells land in the old casual
way, the buyer may cultivate it himself for
a few years, but there is nothing to prevent
him letting it thereafter, aud becoming a land-
lord ; and then things are worse, so far as
the occupier’s craving for the freehold is con-
cerned, than if the State had never parted with
the land. The Bulletin urges Premier McGowen
to consider these points, and to climb down a
little and not to be stiff-necked or poker-
hacked. Even the Tory press speaks reason now
and again. There really is, in the soul of the
bucolic inhabitant, a craving for the freehold, and
though it may be difficult to let him have it in
every case, there is no reason at all why the private
monopolist’s tenant should not get it—especially
as it is the organs of private monopoly which have
most bitterly blithered for it. Moreover, there is
another reason for beginning with the private
landlord’s tenant—he represents the biggest evil
as well as the worst one. According to the figures
given in the latest issue of the “N.S.W. Official
Year-Book” (1908-9), there are in N.S.W.
5288 settlers who are State tenants pure and
simple ; while, on the other hand, there are 13,673
who are private tenants pure and simple. Who,
after reading the Sydney Tory papers, can avoid
feeling a desire to rush to the assistance of 13,673
private tenants pure and simple—to say nothing
of 4492 more who are partly private tenants and
partly freeholders?
Workers’ Compensation by the Thimbleful.
The N.S.W. Labor party might well consider the
repair of Wade’s Workers’ Compensation Act
before the measure is put to practical use next
January. On the second reading last August,
Wade told the House that the Bill was of very
much the same character as the first Act of
the kind placed on the English statute book.
He practically admitted also that even Tory
J. Bull had become so ashamed of that first Act
that it had been remodelled to look less like a
miser’s laundry bill. But Wade’s horror of
Socialism, or community obligation, was such
that, while embracing the principle of workers’
compensation as bait for the October elections, he
fairly trembled lest the Bill should be regarded as
any intention to extend the practice generally.
“To do that,” he said, “would be to lay the
foundation for universal compulsory insurance,
which was one step off State insurance." So, to be
as far removed as possible from that crime, Wade
provided that compensation—and only a thimble-
ful of it at that—should be restricted to those
employed on, in or about—
(a) Any railway, tramway, factory, workshop, mine,
quarry, wharf, vessel, engineering or building, work, any
building used for dumping or storing w 001... or
(b) Any other employment. . . which is declared by
proclamation to be dangerous, provided that no such
proclamation shall be made except pursuant to resolution
of both Houses of Parliament.
Griffith, now Minister for Public Works, while
denouncing the Bill, said it was based on the
Maoriland Act. But, as a matter of truth,
Wade’s Act of 1910 is as narrow as the M.L. Act
of 1908 is broad. Under the M.L. Act an em-
ployer is liable to pay compensation for accidents
to a worker employed—
In and for the purposes of any trade or business
carried on by the employer ; or
In the occupation of mining, quarrying, excavation,
the cutting of standing timber (including the cutting of
scrub, and clearing land of stumps and logs), the erec-
tion or demolition of any building, the manufacture or
use of any explosive, the charge or use of anj 7 machinery
in motion and driven by steam or other mechanical
power, the driving of any vehicle drawn by horse-power
or propelled by mechanical-power, any occupation in
which a worker incurs a risk of falling any distance ex-
ceeding 12ft.
The N.S.W. Act is not only much more limited in its
sphere of operation than this M.L. Act —or than
the Queensland Act—but is also most illiberal
with regard to benefits prescribed. Where total
incapacity results from an injury, it provides for
a maximum payment of £1 a week up to a total
liability of £2OO. To go farther than that Wade
declared would be to imperil the whole fabric of
the measure. Yet he knew—or, if he didn’t know,
his ignorance was even more monumental than
usual—that the M.L. Act had not been imperilled
by providing compensation up to £5OO for total in-
capacity to work, and that the maximum weekly
payment in N.S.W. was the minimum in Maori-
land. Nor could Wade very well overlook the
fact that nothing disastrous or even calamitous
had fallen upon the Queensland scheme, though
it carries a maximum payment of £400; or upon
the South Australian Act, with its maximum of
£350. Moreover, in the case of Queensland, the
Act applies to an employee on, in, or about—
(l) Any industrial, commercial, manufacturing or
building work ... or
(2) Any agricultural, horticultural, or pastoral work
... or
(3) Any mining, quarrying, engineering, or hazardous
work ... or
(4) Any work carried on by or on behalf of the Govern-
ment of Queensland, or any local authority carrying on
work which would in the case of a private employer
come under the Act.
By the exclusion of the N. S. Wales workers on
the land, Donald Macdonell (Chief Secretary
in the State’s Labor Government) estimated that
20,000 pastoral employees alone were deprived of
compensation for injury or death. No doubt
Wade soothed his political conscience for this by
the thought of the grateful vote he would receive
from the ill-informed squatter and the ill-advised
cocky; but it does not explain the difference
between a dead quarry-hand and a defunct shearer
or boundary-rider, nor does it seem to clear up the
two questions that arise: (1) Does it take longer for
the wife and children of a worker on the land to feel
the gnaw of hunger than the wife and children of
a worker in the city? (2) Does it hurt more?
Also, it didn’t capture much in the way of votes.
If nothing else can be done during the November
session towards bringing the Act into line with
those of civilised countries, at least an amending
Bill might make the Act apply to the pastoral a, d
agricultural workers, so that from the beginning
of the year, when the Act starts operations, the
man following a dangerous occupation in the
country may have the same right to the benefits
as his fellow-worker in the city.
The Road to Pumpville.
The result of the local option vote in N. S. Wales
on October 14 could not have been more stunning
to those who rolled the old water-chariot along if an
able-bodied bomb had pushed itself into the argu-
ment. At latest advices from the wreckage, the
remains of Judkins, of Victoria, Nicholls, of
M.L., and Barton, of Glasgow, had been re-
moved in silence, and the survivors were digging
a hole in which to bury the dead Anticipations.
The only section of the procession that obtained
any satisfaction out of the disaster was the Pro-
hibition party, which has practically no sympathy
with the No License, Grog-in-the-Home party.
This party has accordingly met and decided that
the present law is no good anyhow, and should be
amended in the following directions :
(1) That the vote of the people count for the State as
well as the electorate, and apply to production as well as
to sale, on the lines of the Bill now before the Maoriland
Parliament; (2) that the reduction clause be eliminated, as
tending to confuse the issue without serving any useful
purpose ; (3) that the poll be taken on a day apart from a
Parliamentary general election.
Which shows the cheerful habit these people hive
of embracing the first stranger that happens
along. Maoriland’s new Liquor Bill seems very
like a Fiji uncle, and, unless it is amended con-
siderably before it commences business, the Cold
Tea people will probably be sorry they met it.
The advantages it offers to the anti-grog
party are: National prohibition in addition
to local No License, to be carried by 55
per cent, of the voters (as against 60 per
cent, in the existing Act); no liquor to be
imported, manufactured or sold in the Dominion
during the currency of national prohibition ; im-
mediate abolition of bottle licenses, and gradual
abolition of barmaids ; no person under the age of
21 to be served with liquor (a proposal made
by Seddon in 1904); the extinction of the reduc-
tion issue (this may be loaded); poll to operate on
the total number of electors voting (this removes
the 30 per cent, requirement); the locker
system to be illegal, and the brewery
depot to be at least five miles back from
the boundaries of a No License district.
Like all Fiji uncles, this looks very promising,
until a person considers how the advantages are
to be gained. The greater the consideration, the
greater the difficulty appears. There is to be
only one ballot paper, and it is an extremely
guileful document: —
I vote against National Prohibition. (This vote is also
counted in favor of the grant of licenses in the district.)
I vote for National Prohibition. (This vote is also
counted against the grant of licenses in the district.)
It comes to this. An elector must cast his
vote on these two issues, no matter what ill-
wili he may bear to both of them. If national
prohibition (meaning no-license and no grog)
appeals to him as the solution of the liquor pro-
blem, and No License (meaning the closing of the
supervised bars and the opening of half a dozen
worse methods of becoming a snake-charmer)
strikes him as lunacy, he cannot vote for the solu-
tion without voting also for the lunacy. He
may be in favor of local No License, and
opposed to total prohibition, but he must carry
one while he pushes the other. He may
be in favor of reduction —and in that case he gets
no vote at all. One of the strongest props of the
No License party is the moderate drinker ; the
man who says, “Oh, there’s too many pubs, any-
how”; or “ It’s up'to Bung to be shaken up—it’ll
do him good, and make him pay decent wages
and supply pure liquor.” _ The simultaneous
increase of the Dominion No License vote and
of the Dominion’s drink bill is proof of this.
But if the Vinegar party reckons that the
moderate drinker is going to carry on his protest
against whisky and §oda to the extent of cutting
off liis supply lock, stock and barrel, then the
party’s faith is in for another shock. The hole in
the Bill is where the general and mostly moderate-
drinking public has been left out; and it is a large
enough hole for the entire “reform” to drop
through.
Something Rotten.
That vague remark of Shakspeare’s about a pos-
sible rottenness or affliction of white ants in the
supports of Denmark applies in a striking fashion
to the present condition of Britain. The country
is haunted by a conviction that something is.
wrong. A few days ago British Consols, once the
prize security of the world, dropped well below 80
—the record slump for GO years. The scare about
the alleged insufficiency of the British fleet to
provide for the safety of a Freetrade country,
which has almost ceased to grow its own food, and
which might be starved into surrender after a
single disaster at sea, is always present, more or
less. The Territorial army—the last attempt to
prove that it is possible to provide adequate land
defence on voluntary principles—is now admitted
to he plain blank failure. Few recruits are offering,
and the stomach measurement of those who do
offer is spoken of with disrespect. And there is
a bitter wail to the effect that “capital is leaving
the country.” This may or may not be the case,
but it is quite certain that, in the agricultural and
pastoral sections of Britain, big landlords and
ancient peers are rushing their estates into the
market since the new taxation arrived. Even a
proud earl, whose family has held its property
since the days of William the Norman, is among
the sellers. Unfortunately, these sales or attempted
sales open up little prospect of the re-establish-
ment of a prosperous and independent peasant
proprietary. The old big agricultural landlords
are trying to dispose of their goods in haste, be-
cause the tremendous new imposts make their
condition almost hopeless ; but the small men
whom they are trying to beguile into being their
successors will be taxed just as heavily, and will
find their prospects almost equally bad. The posi-
tion which the Englishman persistently bumps up
against these days is somewhat as follows
(1) The most expensive army, navy and general
Government in the world. The voluntary army is
admittedly small and inefficient as well as absurdly ex-
pensive ; but John Bull can’t bear to part with his silly
old boast that he doesn’t go in for “ conscription,” as
foreign nations do.
(2) Very little tariff revenue, it being the theory of the
party in power that the Freetrade madness must be
maintained at any cost.
(3) The heaviest direct taxation on earth, because if
money isn’t obtained at the Customs it must be found
somewhere else. Land is now liable to pay 10 separate
imposts to the central Government, as well as road rates,
poor rates, police rates, education rates, and other local
taxes. These burdens fall on the man with £lOO worth
of soil just as they drop like the gentle ton of bricks from
Heaven on the one with £500,000 worth ; so they do
nothing towards the establishment of a peasant pro-
prietary. . .
(4) The steady destruction of agriculture. The British
farmer’s bushel of wheat is struck, directly and indi-
rectly, by about 15 separate imposts, all levied in order
that there may be no tax on the foreign goods which
come in to compete with him and with the British manu-
facturer. And he has to compete with imported wheat
grown by farmers who have hardly any taxes to struggle
with, because they live under Governments which make
the foreign importer pay the bulk of the national bill.
(5) And as British agriculture fades out under these
impossible conditions, the need for a bloated navy to
protect the foreign wheat ships on which the very exist-
ence of the empire depends, grows more imperative, and
the defence bill grows larger, and the man on the land is
called upon for more taxes in consequence, and that only
accelerates his vanishment.
Even Lloyd George, the bad-tempered financier
who is the mainstay of the present British Gov-
ernment, admits that something is wrong. He
recently announced that out of 420,000 adults who
die annually in the British Isles, 350,000 are
practically penniless, which isn’t an agreeable
condition for 350,000 dead people to be in. And
British public finance isn’t what it was. In 1890
the national and municipal debts of the British
Isles were £997,000,000; in 1900 they were
£1,084,000,000; in 1910 they are £1,600,000,000.
If Britain struck a big war these days, with all
this debt, and Consols already dropping out of
sight, and the peace budget close to £170.000,000
per annum and still rising, there would be in-
teresting times for Bull in his own money market.
And if Australia happened along just then to
speak about a small loan it would be trodden
under foot by the hob-nailed giants of finance.

“Locust”: The reprieve of Phillips by the
McGowkn Cabinet was the pluckiest thing done
by a Government in Australia for a long time. It
is to be hoped it will lead to a drastic inquiry into
our code of punishments, and into criminal trials
and treatment generally. The crime was hideous.
Admitted ; but the creature was scarcely human.
Anyone who witnessed the trial can testify to
that. The daily press in this, as in many other
cases, aroused prejudice against the accused by
adding a private count of its own, viz., “pre-
serving a sullen and impassive demeanor.” If you
tried a dog for killing a cat or a parrot, or for
smothering one of its pups, or a lioness for eating
its litter, the animal would “ preserve a sullen or
impassive demeanor.” Phillips was a stupid
animal, and no more realised the horror of the
crime and of his own position than a wild or
a domesticated beast could. To have hanged
such a human brute would have been as rational
as to have strangled the delinquent animal. The
McGowkn Government must have known that
the few who cry for blood and executions in
N. S. Wales are noisier than the multitude who
are shocked equally at judicial as at private ven-
geance. Therefore, the action of the Cabinet in
reprieving in this shocking and sensational case
was, in its way, a big, brave thing, which counts
for righteousness. Personally, Ido not favor the
abolition of capital punishment, and believe, with
Hugo, that if it is to be abolished “ the assassins
should begin.” But degrees of crime should be
established in our criminal code, and the last
penalty exacted only from those whose crime is
of the first degree. Congenital brutes and
atavistic survivals of prehistoric man like
Phillips should not be strangled, but chained up
for life.
Almost the last official act of the Wade Ministry,
before it ceased to infest N.S.W., was a shocking
example of the “Liberal” crowd’s hatred of
Australian industry. The Public Works Depart-
ment wanted an oil engine to drive a punt. A
Sydney firm offered to supply the engine, to put
it in position on the punt, and to guarantee its
satisfactory running for five years, for £342. A
United States firm offered to drop the required
engine on the wharf and leave things at
that. If the engine proved an utter failure
the U.S. firm would be too far away for
any useful argument. The foreigner’s figure
was £32s—nominally £l7 less than the Sydney firm
asked, but really a good deal more when the
questions of the installation and the guarantee
were considered—but then it was a foreign firm,
so it got the job. The wretched Wade push hadn’t
the sense to see that out pf the local £342 about £34
would have come back to it the first year in taxes
and other forms of revenue, while out of the £325
which goes to the U.S. it will get nothing back

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The big Town Hall is ablaze with light,
And banners and flags hang everywhere ;
Festoons and blossoms gladden the sight,
And the tables are spread with the choicest
fare.
Soft music swells, and eddies, and dies,
While jest and laughter go left and right ;
On champagne bubbles the evening flies—
The Mayoral Banquet is held to-night.
The toast is drunk and the speech is made,
Each orator sinks in a wave of cheers;
Though the feast will end and the roses fade,
’Tis the jolliest night we have known for years !
But hark ! Is it far or near at hand,
That faint, repetitive note that comes
Above the cheers and the muted band ?. ..
By Heaven—it is the roll of drums !
Rat-a-plan ! Rat-a-plan J
■ Sap the drums of Japan.
A riot of color covers the lawn,
Flecked with the sunlight that fleets away ;
Under the sycamore trees withdrawn
The blatant bookmakers bawl and bray ;
The hill and the flat are packed, pell-mell,
For thirty horses are lining up :
They're off! ... A shout, and a deep-toned bell —
Australia watches the Melbourne Cup.
Just for a minute the racecourse spins,
Mad with excitement and noise and heat;
Roar follows roar : “ The favorite wins ! ”
“ No! he's beaten! . . . By half a street!” . . .
Yet in the din, to all who have ears,
Out of the distance there throbs and thrums,
Over the shouts, and hoots, and cheers,
The menacing note of the unseen drums—
Rat-a-plan! Rat-a-plan J
Say the drums of Japan.
When nymph-like Summer regains our shores,
On a gold-and-silver beach to play,
Where the crystal urn of the Sea outpours
The purple pomp of Imperial Day,
And the ripples, that rose where a zephyr trod
Andean calms, into glory break—
Then to worship the Ocean-god
Our youths and maidens their glad way take.
And forth they go in their thousands brave—
Out where the breakers curl and comb,
They dance the Dance of the Lifting Wave,
Thrilled in the clasp of the clinging foam ;
But ever along the silver verge,
Filled with shoutings and laughter, comes—
Above the song of the rushing surge
And the merry clamor —the roll of drums—
Rat-a-plan ! Rat-a-plan !
Say the drums of Japan.
Hark to the voices the cities raise !
Rattle of traffic and boom of car,
Jostle of buyers in all the ways,
Fury and noise where the brokers are;
With chink of gold and clatter of scales,
And waste and anger and petty hate,
And covetousness that never fails
The cities hurry towards their fate !
Those who have marked the signs, and discern ;
Those who have listened and plainly heard ;
Those who implore the rulers to learn
Are made a jest and a scornful word !
For lust of Pleasure and Profit fill
Alike smug streets and squabbling slums ;
But beating nearer and nearer still
Is heard the roll of those unseen drums—
Rat-a-plan ! Rat-a-plan !
Say the drums of Japan.

all ideas of patriotism, would have made it worth
while to assist the Australian producer. A dull,
cow-like conviction that Australian manufactures
should be discouraged is the chief curse of the old
Foreign-trade push, of which the new “Liberal”

The S. M. Herald recently gave Premier
McGowen, of N.S. W., this excellent testi-
monial :
The Premier (Mr. McGowen), being an advocate of
decentralisation of traffic from the country, is anxious
that the Royal Commission inquiring into the subject
[the Closed Ports] should bring in its report as soon as
possible. Amongst his callers yesterday were the mem-
bers of that body, who explained to the Premier the stage
their work had reached, and their plans for further prose-
cution of the investigations. They informed the Premier
that they return again to the North in search of definite
information, the request for which was made on their
former visit; and will also go to the Southern Districts
again. Mr. McGowen requested them to push on with
the inquiries.
And while Premier McGowen is on the question
he might devote half a second of profound thought
to the remarkable case of Jervis Bay. That is one
of the three or four notable Closed Harbors of
N.S. W. There is to be a Federal port there ; but
the port is to stop at high-water mark, so
that it is difficult to see what good it will
be, either to the Commonwealth, which will
own the dry shore and won’t be able legally
to get to sea, or to the State which will
own the wet sea but won’t be legally able to get
to land. Then a port is of no value unless there
is a town there, but a town is impossible without
a water supply, and that necessitates a big water
catchment area. The Federal authority is only
to have a few square miles of land, which will
catch about enough water to fill a tank ; every-
thing else thereabouts will be State land on which
the Commonwealth will have no power to collect
a pint of fluid. These insane results, arrived at
by way of a paltry sacrifice to State jealousy,
seem only intended to make a large section of
Jervis Bay useless to man or beast. The old
McGowen— the purely local and bitterly anti-
Australian one—helped all he knew to bring them
about. What has the new McGowen to say
about the matter ?

If Premier Murray’s Bill for suppressing Sun-
day entertainments in Melbourne is passed into
law, some of the Sunday entertainers will have
themselves to thank for it. At a special meeting
of the Professional Musicians’ Association a num-
ber of short-sighted spokesmen practically en-
dorsed the Sabbatarian argument in favor of the
Bill by snorting at the “Socialism” of its most
active opponent, H. H. Champion. Certain
musicians followed in the same foolish way
by suggesting that, unless the Government were
given fuller powers of prohibition, the theatres
would open on Sundays, and absorb the members
of the Yic. Professional Orchestra. Finally, a
majority of the musicians decided to “ deprecate
any action which might interfere with the new
Act.” The idea, presumably, of these incon-
sistent citizens, who are trying to popularise
Sunday Orchestra Concerts by deed, whilst sup-
porting Murray’s Bill in speech, is that the
Orchestra will get a special permit to perform
on Sundays. But they are counting without a
due appreciation of the power they would grant
to Wowser-ridden Governments. Even though
one Chief Secretary made a distinction in favor
of one or two classes of Sunday entertainments,
the next autocrat might blot them all out. The
Bill as it stands could be turned against every
form of entertainment. If the musicians really
want to give concerts on the Day of Dogma, they
must get their permit embodied in the Bill, or
consider themselves doomed to discomfiture,
sooner or later.

Edward Pulsford, ex-Senator, dropped .these
remarks into the Sydney Telegraph recently:—
Sir, —Let me suggest to the Labor party that it is just
about time for them to cease their talk about not getting
fair play from the press. There isalack of manlinessabout
this style of talk. It is too much allied to the “dead-
cat ” method so much in vogue of late.
I have no shadow of hesitation in saying that the Labor
party, in the main, owe the political power they have now
attained to the daily press. Look at your paper, Mr.
Editor.
The truth is that the Labor party has full advantage of
the publicity of the daily press. It is time the farce
ended.
Now, however much of a political back-number
Edward may be, he still retains, presumably, his
old-time capacity for understanding simple
figures. And when he talks of the “fair
play” the N.S. W. Labor party got from
the daily press in general and the Sydney
Telegraph in particular, one is fain to
remind him of Wade’s Railway Superan-
nuation Fund, and inquire (1) What does he
think of the financial aspect of that scheme?
(2) Did he see it man-handled as it should have
been by Sydney’s allegedly impartial press?
Plainly the thing is either a swindle, framed and
exploited with the cynical object of snaring the
votes of railway and tramway employees, or it is
a manifestation of dangerous ignorance or idiocy
in high places. In either case a responsible press
with any claims to be unbiassed should have scari-
fied it off the face of the Statute Book. Did
the Telegraph attempt anything of that sort ?
And when a sap-headed railway-man got up in
public, shortly before election day, and maun-
dered about “ the blessings of Mr. Wade’s super-
annuation legislation,” the Telegraph published
his remarks, and carefully refrained from telling
him what he was, and that the fund was a fraud
foredoomed to the most radical amendment, or
else to repudiation by a Government yet unborn.
There are various ways in which the press may
deny fair play to a political party. Chief among
them is to conceal from the public material facts
calculated to damage the party’s opponents. If
Edward Pulsford is really unable to see that the
murky silence of the “Liberal” press in regard
to the impracticability of Wade’s Superannuation
Fund was unfair to Labor, he has mislaid his old
faculty for adding two and two together, and he
is capable of arguing that it is a fair thing to
stand unprotestingly by while a man’s pocket is
being picked.
—
The other day Tait, of the Victorian railways,
staggered the Parliamentary Committee which is
inquiring into the matter of revising the tram
fares. His Department, he said, had spent a lot
of time and money in dissecting the receipts and
expenditures for the different country and sub-
urban lines, and, after making due allowance for
incidental-suburban and essential-country ex-
penditure on the city lines, and debiting them
with their fair proportion of interest charges and
replacement of rolling stock, the annual deficit on
the suburban lines was £50,000 ! There is no
way of checking the calculation ; but one
or two of the public remember the evi-
dence given by R. G. Kent, secretary for
railways, to a Leg. Council Select Committee in
September, 1901. This was to the effect that, as
far as the Department could figure it out, there
was, at that date, an annual profit on the suburban
system of £60,000. Seeing that traffic has more
than doubled since then, Tait’s assertion seems,
then, to call for corroboration. But, in any case,
what lias it got to do with the tram fares? The
question isn’t what the railways are making, but
what the tramways are making , and the gorge-
ous tramway figures are plain enough. Ice
might cost £2 an oz. to make on the hobs of
Hades; but that is no reason why anybody else
should charge £2 an oz. for it. Yet, apparently,
the argument was that there shouldn’t be any
reduction in tram fares because Tait was losing
money in competing with the trams even at their
present fares.

From the Sydney Daily Telegraph (28/10/’10),
regarding the proposed amendments to the Con-
stitution :•*—
For when the States federated they did so under a
clearly-worded compact which guaranteed them certain
rights over their own domestic affairs and properties, but
under this scheme they would lose those rights and
themselves be submerged in a unification.
The Telegraph is quite right when it says that
the Federal compact was clearly worded ; and
nowhere is it more clearly worded than
in. that portion where the method of
amending the Act is set forth. A little
over 10 years ago the Telegraph stormed
because alteration was made too difficult, and
succeeded, with the aid of the N.S.W. Par-
liament, in defeating the first proposal, chiefly by
hollering about the “Cast-iron Constitution.”
Thus it got the amendment of the Constitution
made easier; yet it now assumes that amendment
is a breach of faith. It built a bridge, and in-
sisted that it should be an easy bridge to cross;
and now when anybody proposes to cross it, it
has the nerve to allege that it was never in-
tended that the thing should be used for traffic.

“Adelaide” on Why the Totalisator Must Come :
It is the racing man’s sole objection to the totalisator
that the owner who thinks long beforehand that he has a
good thing cannot get a long price. But that is not
enough to send owners out of the game. (In arguing
about the tote, always remember that the smaller States
have gone right through the mill already, and know all
the arguments and the answers to them when there are
any.) Owners score thus
(1) The club gets a big steady income from the machine,
and can thus reduce entry-fees and increase stakes.
Entry in Victoria, for instance, is expensive and out of
all proportion to entry in S.A.
(2) The tote doesn’t care a hang what wins, or doesn’t
win. Thus there is no keen financier whose solvency
depends on your horse losing, and who may be tempted
to tempt your jockey. With the tote, if a horse is
“ pulled ” it can only be by the owner’s wish.
Then the people-at-large score thus: —
(1) They are sure of a fair run for their money, always
supposing the owner is not stiff to get the weight off for
another event to come, and for that evil there is no cure,
unless stipendiary stewards can supply it.
(2) They have to bet in cash. This is inconvenient at
the moment, but a blessing in the long run, and might
be applied to the Stock Exchange with advantage. It is
so easy to pile on a “real good thing” more with your
mouth than you can afford to pay with your pocket. The
typical clerk-gone-wrong embezzles to pay up his gambling
debts. He is not likely to embezzle in advance to get
the money to bet with.
(3) They never back a non-starter.
(4) They do not have to hunt about the ring for the
longest price available. The price they get is the fair
one, automatically making itself, and the taking a ticket
is as simple and businesslike an arrangement as taking
one at a railway station. In fact, the chief argument
of the anti-betting fanatics is that the machine gives
“an air of respectability ”to the sinful wager. The tote
is the high-class hotel, the bookmaker the sly-grog shop.
(5) They always get paid if they win ; and, if they
lose, the money is in the pockets of their friends—not of
a set of parasites who live on the game.
As to the absence of yelling, and of riffraff, and the
better prices given about outsiders (£59 3s. on the
recent S. A. Derby, in a field of 12!) the Bulle-
tin has said all that already. The racing club
takes (in S.A.) Is. 6d. of every £1 invested, and the
Government 6d. more. It is nob missed; nobody sup-
poses that a bookmaker works on as low a basis as 10 per
cent, of profit. The club’s commission generally is as
much as the stake run for, or nearly so ; and then
naturally the stakes get increased. Finally, the odd
coppers of the dividends are never paid out, and make a
surprisingly handsome sum each meeting for the Disabled
Jockeys’ Fund and other charities.
Thus J. A. Hogue, ex-M.L.A., at the
Glebe (N.S.W.) “Liberal” League’s post-mortem
on him last Monday night:—
Glebe was not, and never had been, a Labor constitu-
ency. At the recent election at least 1500 effective votes
were not polled, and of these about 90 per cent, were
certainly Liberal. So they saw how easy it was to throw
a seat away. This was the fault of the apathetic
Liberals.
It was an inauspicious moment to choose for the
seasoned old moan. On the identical morning it
appeared the “ Liberal ” press mentioned that, in
the Durham electorate, where on October 14
(with 68 percent, of electors voting) the “Liberal”
majority was 559, on Thursday last (with 78 per
cent, of electors voting) the “Liberal” majority
had dropped to seven.
S. Aus. Supreme Court has been investi-
gating the life history of a man who was, at any
rate, as Judge Gordon said, “ a first-class liar.”
He was a country doctor, who seems to have
looked on the wine when it was various colors,
and to have had the unpleasant habit of sitting
up in bed sharpening a razor while his wife
looked on. Finally, he passed out, leaving every-
thing to his professional partner; and a brother,
not liking this arrangement, contested the will.
The doctor who survives swore that his friend
told a death-bed tale of a Scotch marriage con-
tracted long ago in Edinburgh, and begged him to
take all the property in trust for the real Austra-
lian wife. In the end the will was found by the
Court to be quite good. Then the expensive
lawyers suggested that, at any rate, they would
have their whack out of the estate ; but the Court
remarked coldly that Costs would be paid by the
loser just as in any other legal squabble. It is
poor business contesting a will in S. Aus. these
times.
Look at this, the transactions of the Vic.

Now at this from the Melbourne Age (24/10/’10):
There is an unusually large exodus of farmers from the
Jeparit district to New South Wales, where cheap lands
are obtainable.
From which it appears that, while the Land Pur-
chase Board is securing land for settlement, and
thus incidentally raising the price of land, settle-
ment is quietly leaving the land because of the
high price to which Victorian farms have been
forced through the absence of a progressive land
tax.

The story of “ Mr. Preedy and the
Countess,” which treads fast upon the fleeing tail
of “The Night of the Party ” at Sydney Criterion,
presents some points of resemblance to its prede-
cessor. In each case the scene is laid in a
bachelor’s chambers, and the bachelor has a
cheeky comic valet, and is brought to great em-
barrassment by the advent of a titled lady on his
premises. The homeless, catlike and casual habits
of the British aristocracy stick out conspicuously
in these plays. But whereas in “The Night of
the Party ” the owner of the chambers is little
more than a cipher and the story revolves round
his valet, Mr. Preedy is himself the hero, and
his valet, who looks like a flushed hangman, is
quite a subsidiary character. Preedy is a mild
and humble hero, living principally on chops up-
stairs. He is junior partner of Bounsall, a
robust warehouseman with a yacht and a craving
for society. And when Robert Jannerway,
second husband of Lady Rushmere, does his
tenth elopement or thereabouts—he has fled with
a chorus girl to Egypt, and is last heard of lunch-
ing with Pharaoh —it is decided that the lady
shall be put under the charge of an aged female
Bounsall till she gets her divorce, and shall then
marry the shouting shopkeeper. The lady has no
assets except her tremendous stature. Her hus-
band has apparently no money save a pair of
shaky legs ; in fact, he has difficulty about rais-
ing the funds to escape from Egypt. There
is a disreputable earl in the family ; also an aged
lord with a pint of white fluff on his face.
When Bounsall, interrupted halfway in his
elopement by the news that a rich bedridden
relative is on his last legs, drops the formidable
lady in Preedy’s rooms and rushes to look after
his own interests, Preedy has the joy of meeting
all these people. And when Bounsall reports that.
he has placated his rich dying relative by marry-
a strange girl at a moment’s notice, and leaves his
partly-eloped-with peeress on Preedy’s hands, the
British aristocracy simply rallies round Preedy.
He is a small man, and only comes to the top of
the troubled family sea now and again. Because
the lady occupied his bedroom for a night the
peerage fears the worst. Another wave that breaks
heavily on the coast of Preedy is a base dentist
who wants to marry Preedy’s best girl. He also
fears the worst and is not backward at mentioning
the fact. And he gnashes his stock at his rival in
a vindictive fashion.
Preedy is a hero in a way, but after
all no very dreadful complications befall him. His
best girl and her father accept his explanations at
the first time of asking. He throws out the base
dentist and all his teeth. The peerage falls back
in disorder, and apologises as soon as the lady sets
forth the facts of the case. Also, it patches up its
internal dissensions, while Bounsall is scorned by
all hands, and treated as if he were a dog. In
fact, Preedy only loses his cook and the use of his
bed for one night, and, as a set-off, he gains the
habit of telling Bounsall his candid opinion of
him; so, on the whole, he is something to the
good. David James makes of him a very pleasing bit
of comedy in the regular David James manner—
a restless, hurried, galvanic little man with quaint
mannerisms and a Cockney outlook upon events.
George Willoughby is rather less satisfactory.
Bounsall is understood to be a roarer of the worst
description, but though he roars with his voice he
wears an almost mild countenance, and he hardly
casts his stomach ahead of him with the fury that
might be expected. The massive Mab Paul is
especially excellent as the countess; and the same
may be said of Amy Willard, the hastily engaged
lady’s maid, who is willing to come for £3O a year
when she thinks Preedy is married to the coun-
tess, but demands £4O and beer—£lo for
outraged morality and beer to drown her
finer feelings in—when she finds that he
isn’t. It is a pathetic essay on the Price
of Respectability. Violet Paget is good in a
small, quiet part. Harold Parkes is especially fine
as a sample of the British aristocracy ; and Hugh
Buckler, Arthur Cornell and Harry Halley are
hereby handed the butter of commendation on a
sizeable dish.
* * *
“ Mr. Preedy ” is preceded by “ Slippery
Jim,” in one act. If it were possible to put
“ Slippery Jim ” into less than one act it might
be advisable to do so. It might even be put in a
bottle and thrown overboard.
** * *
Critics may arise and heave the foetid
cat; Judges drip dull warning from their alti-
tudes; publicists denounce the trend of stage
tripe; and educationalists deliver themselves of
their messages—the bellowdrama hurtles through
time, firing revolvers into the crowd with the in-
discrimination of an unlicensed maniac, flaring
the night with its incendiary torches, wrecking,
pillaging, seducing, torturing, marrying, murder-
ing and playing up eternal Sheol regardless. It's
troubles; it has leased the stand for life! The
which philosophical, but otherwise accurate re-
marks are the direct result of a person studying
the cash business at the Palace (Sydney), where
the Hamilton-Maxwell Co. has been showing for
several weeks past.
* * * *
And a person is forced to the conclusion, after
studying Palace audiences, that a more whole-
souled interest is taken in bellowdrama than in
any other form of stage distraction. If a person
studies a grand opera audience he finds an arti-
ficial response overlapping the genuine apprecia-
tion ; if he be cajoled to a concert he discovers a
lively exhibition of ennui; if he visits a music
hall the smell of the atmosphere assures him that
whisky is responsible for many of the encores ; if
his wife drags him to a musical comedy he knows
that he has the sympathy of every man in the house.
But bellowdrama —there is THE audience. No
pretence.no tired feeling, no demands to have
the admission money returned—nothing but
horrifying delight; delightful horror; tears that
well from the most pleasurable melancholy ; the
loud enthusiastic hoot and howl; the raw, unre-
strained guffaw. A person can enjoy himself at a
bellowdrama—especially if he doesn’t watch the
stage.
* * * *
Which brings a person to the first produc-
tion of “The Spider and the Fly” on Satur-
day night at the Palace. When the curtain
was furled there wasn’t room to squeeze an-
other patron into the theatre; and when it
fell for the last time there wasn’t an
audience in Sydney that left for home
more satisfied that life had its compensations.
There is nothing new in Sutton Vane and Arthur
Shirley’s bellow ; it merely provides more work
for familiar characters in old, reliable situations.
The hero in his early days marries a lady related
to Kipling’s “Vampire,” but she disappears;
and, believing her dead, he goes to the other
extreme and marries a clergyman’s daughter. A
few months later, the hero’s old man dies, and
leaves him (the hero) his (the hero’s old man’s)
fortune. The villain is the hero’s half-brother,
and, because he is refused half the estate, he pro-
duces the first wife and threatens a charge of
bigamy. This so enrages the second wife that
she informs the assembled company that she is
not the hero’s wife at all, but merely the lady
who resides with him. And, as nobody thinks of
turning up the registers, it has to go at that.
Then the portion of brother and the Vampire de-
cide to wipe the whole family out. Husband and
wife are entrapped to the Old Moat House, while
the child is kidnapped and left on the banks of
the river to die, or grow up on a grass diet. The
principal thrill comes soon after, when the hero
and his second missus are locked in a cage, the
roof of which is by a mechanical device made to
descend with murderous intent. The
sets it in motion while the Vampire stays inside
for a minute to taunt the victims. Just as the
grand squash appears a certainty, however, a
rescue party arrives, and the projected sand-
wiches are removed—all except the Vampire,
who, being unable to escape in the excitement,
is slowly and carefully turned into pulp to the
accompaniment of heart-freezing shrieks from
herself, and an enthusiastic and unanimous vote
of thanks from the audience. The o‘s-brother is
promptly lumbered, and in attempting to escape
from the outraged law, is shot dead by a bald-
headed warder with a blank cartridge.

“ Paid in Full ” retires from Sydney
Royal after next Friday night in favpr of
“ Salvation Nell.” The new show is said to
give full scope to Miss Katherine Grey’s emo-
tional genius. Unless report lies even more
villainously than usual, “ Salvation Nell ” is cal-
culated to evoke sobs from a brass monkey, much
less the tender-hearted Sydney folk who are ex-
pected to flock to it.

Dan, the Drunken Dog comedian of
Charles Barnold’s animal troupe, should draw
tramloads of cash to Sydney Tivoli. He is the
hairy star of the company, which consists of 13
dogs, eight monkeys and a placid, lady-like cat.
Every animal but the eager dog that plays the
horse in the police patrol waggon minces along on
its hind-legs in some sort of human garb. The
undoglike gait suits best a slim terrier in a scarlet
Directoire dress. Dan, the silent and degraded, sits
in loose, dusty garments and a battered top hat on
a small keg at the saloon entrance, and waits until
a thirsty dog comes along and pushes in through
the swing doors. Then he rises hastily and
pushes after him. An interval elapses; the
refreshed customer emerges and walks off; Dan
comes out, resumes his seat on the keg and licks
his chops. Finally, after cadging many drinks,
he gets drunk, and clings to a lamp-post till a
fierce and business-like monkey policeman drags
him by the collar to the alarm and rings up the
gaol; and the silent and unresisting Dan is
bundled in and the patrol waggon rattles off. The
turn is put through cleverly without a sign of
human aid.

For quick work, the West Picture people’s
handling of the Melbourne Cup was under even
time. The race film was developed in Melbourne
immediately the race was finished, shipped to
Sydney by the night express, and printed in
Sydney on Wednesday morning with a view to ex-
hibition at the Glaciarium on Wednesday even-
ing. To beat this it would be necessary to devise
a telegraphic cinematograph, and' that is a little
bit ahead of us.

GREY HAIR MAKES YOUR FACE
LOOK OLD.
A young face looks old if it is surrounded with
grey, faded or dead-looking hair. Allen’s
Mexican Walnut Stain will make from 10 to 20
years difference in your appearance if you are
grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly harm-
less, and easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth or younger
years. ■ /
Allen’s Mexican Walnut Stain is not to be
confounded with the common or garden “hair
which deceive nobody but the deluded
users. This unique preparation is offered a
superior stain, and its composition has been
arrived at only after a long series of experimehts.
No injurious effect will be produced, provided the
simple directions are followed out —it is quite free
from Lead, Mercury or Sulphur. It is equally
suitable for ladies’ hair or hair of the beard or
moustache, and will not wash off or stain the linen.
None Genuine without the signature of Alfred
Ardlhy. Registered in the Patents Office of the
Commonwealth of Australasia, and sold by all
reputable Chemists.*
guineas’ worth of masterly drawing and
glowing coloring, now (with others) on exhibition
at the Q. V. Markets, deserves most of the
admiration it receives. But the expression on the
face of the standing figure—the owner of the blue
hat that a devoted mother is posing on the head
of an ivory-faced boy—suggests that the lady
ought to try the consolations of religion
as a counter-irritant for superciliousness.
Lambert’s Venuses are large potatoes and many
on the hill of Venusberg. They are of the over-
blown order that Rubens and Velasquez exalted
into a type; they are the Flanders mares that
Henry VIII. said his wife of the moment was.
According to a partisan in The Lone Hand,
the Lambert of to-day does not like his
" BlaCksoil Plains” picture in the Sydney Gallery
any more. He would wish to retrieve and then
possibly destroy it. This present Philistine
writer suggests that he should get it back,
paint out the horses, and substitute a team of
his Venuses. They could shift any waggon.
Several of Lambert’s nudes are worrying the
Literalists, who always want to know “What
does it mean?” The Lambertians respond,
“What does it matter what it means? ‘The
Betrothed ’ by any other name would still
show the same unity of impression, and
harmony of "olor. Perish in thy literalism, thou
Philistine ! ” When they don’t so respond, they
fall back on those mighty bulwarks —Rubens,
Velasquez and Tintoretto—whose disciple Lam-
bert seems to have become. Only Lambert’s
nudes are uglier, older women than those
of the three Masters. And the Philistine
will go on thinking that the immodesty
of an ugly woman when it does occur lacks
sufficient reason, and is therefore indecent.
Then there have been great painters before and
since Velasquez who did notpaintoverblown, short-
legged women. The gem of the exhibition is the
artist’s portrait of himself. The chorus of apprecia-
tion over the absolute life-likeness of its flesh paint-
ing and coloring has been insistent. Another
head hanging to the right of “ The Blue Hat ’’ is a
splendid study. Lambert’s supreme excellence
lies in his portrait-painting.

The gaudy foolishness of “A Knight for a
Day ” struck Melbourne on Derby night at the
Princess’s, and for a little while it may supply
amusement to a tired world. For the most part,
this strange thing from America is a distended
imitation of the variety-hall “sketch,” in which
a gentleman, professing to meet a lady for the
first time, greets her by raising his hat from the
rear and invites irrelevant reprisals. But whereas
there is often wit of a kind in a music-
hall dualogue, there is never aught but
crude drivel or aged gag in the interchanges of
the characters , who hustle in “A Knight for a
Day.” Chunks of meaningless mock-tragedy are
hurled into the conversation to keep it going ;
grotesque incidents are resorted to merely for the
sake of their grotesqueness, and music without
form or force runs in and out of the proceedings
like a March hare. Nothing but nonsense
happens any time, nor is the law of cause and
effect ever applied to the case except when the
undersized heroine draws liquor from a well
wherein Bert Gilbert has smashed a case of
champagne. Then she partakes freely of the sup-
posititious refreshment, and lapses into quaint in-
toxication. Or she did on Saturday. Perhaps the
members of the company take it in turns to perpe-
trate this joke. Saturday’s performance gave the
impression that it was being manufactured as it
went along—that the principals got stage instruc-
tions to go on and do something and say something,
and were cut out of their turns by the ballet and
chorus if they paused for lack of ideas.
* * * *
The ballet and chorus and spectacular
surprises introduced into the farce give it some
claims to pantomime distinction. But the most
remarkable fact about the foolishness of it all is the
toleration it begets. The quality of the stuff never
varies, yet the second and third hours of it are
hardly less endurable than the first. It is a ridicu-
lously thin entertainment to be stretched from
8 p.m. till 11, but it bears the strain. The per-
formers handle it lightly, and the music, perhaps,
gives the members of the audience no time to
collect their angry thoughts concerning the
matter. Miss Toby Claude, the small and fre-
quent lady of the piece, is energetically funny
rather than truly humorous. Bert Gilbert labors
hard and successfully to be absurd, whilst W. S.
Percy labors with less success. Miss Godwin,
Clayton, Bathurst, Miss Sargent and the tremo-
loic Frank Greene are more or less implicated in
the crime, and three young ladies speak and act
their little parts in a promising manner. Would
that they were doing just as nicely in a more
promising piece !

At Her Majesty’s (Melbourne) there is not
yet any mention of the last nights of “The Whip”;
but in the fulness of time that flourishing melo-
drama will have to stop, and then it is said a revival
of “The Harbor Lights” will be submitted to the
present generation. Last Saturday, by the way,
the distinguished Gee-Gee from Government
House went to see “ The Whip,” and it is be-
lieved that some intrepid members of the Hunt
Club sat around the festive board of the Marquis
of Somebody, and tried to behave like supers in
honor of the vice-regal presence. Such loyalty is
touching.

“ By Wireless Telegraphy ” ; The topical
murderdrama at the King’s was pruned of half an
hour’s superfluous badinage after its first night,
and its brief career, which terminates to-night
(Thursday), has been prosperous enough. The
Andersonian company is tripping to Adelaide for
a change of air, it seems; and on Saturday the
running will be taken up by Maggie Moore and
H. R. Roberts, who have not been seen in Mel-
bourne for many a long month. They are staging
“The Shadows of a Great City.” In that old-
established drama Maggie will revive memories of
yore by appearing as Biddy Roonan.

At the Opera House things are what they
were last week. Marbas, the agile French
frivoller, and his chic lady companion in the glad
raiment are the brightest of the latest turns ;
whilst Judge Kelly and Yeamans-Titus shine in
the foreground as before. The Charlenes and
Meymotts have arrived at their hist week, but the
gap they will leave in a long bill hardly needs
filling-
** * *
Wirfchs’ Circus is putting in its annual
visit to Melbourne, with the usual results, at the
same old spot. A new outbreak of colored lamps
proclaims the whereabouts of the tent, and the
way is paved with the delicate aroma of several
elephants and many beasts that take their meals
ravenously. Also, the air is heavy with the
neighs of gallant steeds, and the stuffed semblance
of a dead-and-gone giraffe serves as a finger-post
to Lizzie, the hippopotamus, who is the men-
agerie’s sovereign lady just now. Within the
tent the lions hold their own as exciting per-
formers. Their feats are few, but their teeth are
numerous, and their habit of gleaming them at
Marco, their master, is an entertainment in itself.
The male lion makes himself especially unpleasant
these times. He snarls meaningly, and the other
night he said something which caused Marco to
look round suddenly, as though he didn’t like
being spoken to in that way.

Another of the open-air theatres at St.
Kilda (Vic.) renewed its claims to fair-weather
patronage the other Monday night. The Jesters,
whose local habitation is “Arcadia,” opened their
season under a glowering sky, and for a while
the elements threatened disaster to the in-
augural performance. But the rain held off
until half-time, when as many of the crowded
spectators as didn’t get away hastily were
presumably damped in their enthusiasm. The
writer seized the interval by the forelock and
escaped the downpour. Up to then the Jesters
had done nothing to impair the reputation of
Branscombe’s summer show. The entertainment
was light and breezy. Three members of the
company of seven were recent importations from
Britain ; the other four, including the two lady
Jesters, had been carried forward from last
summer. All of them undertook to be entertain-
ing in turn, and the result in each case was a
mildly uproarious encore.

“A Shy Youth,” at West’s, Melbourne,
will make the baldhead chuckle and the Wowser
whine. Of the others, “ Saved by the Flag” is a
Jack Harkawav yarn, running to the strains of
“ Yankee Doodle ” ; “ Ah Sin and the Greasers ”
is after the mode of Wild West humor that de-
pends for its laugh on a flourish of “guns”;
while “An Unexpected Reward” narrates the
result of rescuing a drowning girl. The Reward,
of course, is marriage, monotonous evenings and
mutton stews.

The Follies at St. Kilda (Vic.) have much
improved on their opening performance, and now
give good measure of the stuff that joy is made of.
To be sure, Howard Hall is not so frivolous as he
might be, and, when he plays an amorous Darby
to Miss Harbor’s Joan, is about as enraptured as
a keg of corned beef. But this is only a minor
defect. The party is embellished bv the presence
of small Donald Cameron. The child, who looks
about 10, and has the assurance of 50, gives some
imitations of Harry Lauder, which would be
less entertaining in a much older boy.

The finish of “ The Dollar Princess ” at
Adelaide Royal saw a new leading lady in the
part formerly taken by Miss Edmond.’ Miss Ivy
Bickford is a Melbourne Conservatorium pupil,
tall and graceful, with an adequate voice ; and as
this was her first professional appearance, the
bloom of the amateur is not yet rubbed off. Now
black darkness has unexpectedly settled down on
the Royal for a week. “ The Brass Bottle ” was
to have come, but something went wrong with
the works in Melbourne, so the jinn will not
see Adelaide. At the Tivoli, Alexander Prince,
who claims to be the greatest' concertina
soloist in England, has just arrived thence.
Larry Lewis made an immediate impression,
but no turn gets louder applause than the
imitations of Fanny Powers. Tjie picture
business is booming. Lennon, Hyman and Len-
non, of the Empire, have two country rounds ;
and even the Royal and the Tivoli put up films on
Sunday evenings. By the way, that Commercial
Travellers’ frivoi attracted a crowd of 28,000 and
a gate of over £BOO, of which all but some £BO for
expenses goes to charities. The Jubilee Oval will
not give a crowd like that a fair view of the arena,
and the Adelaide Oval is a certainty for next year.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Cabled that Lewis Waller, the romantic Beaucaire of
the English stage, is to bring a company to Australia in
1912 under engagement to Clarke and Meynell. The
announcement sounds rather previous. There is so much
time for things to happen before the year after next.
“Sikes”: “Salvation Nell,” now in rehearsal at
Sydney Royal, is one of the plays bought by Harold
Ashton for the Williamson firm during his last visit to
the United States. Salvation Nell is employed in a
N’York saloon as a scrubber-out, and one night a tough
tries to kiss her. The usual low-down bar-loafer, whose
stage morality is invariably strict enough to make even
Judkins ashamed of his indiscretions, is struck dumb
with this outrage, and fells the blackguard, amid frantic
cheers from the peanut stalls. Several John Hops
immediately arrive, and sentence the moral beer-
sparrer to eight years for manslaughter. Meantime
the lady with the Outraged Feelings falls sobbing ihto
the arms of a General Boothess. When the morally-
sensitive hum gets his discharge he seeks out the lady
who was the cause of his inconvenience. She, despite
the eight years of salvation, finds she loves him still, and
begs him to reform for the sake of their child. (The
child happened back in the Past.) He replies that he
cannot reform until after that night, owing to an ap-
pointment he has with a swell’s diamonds. Thisprovides
the big scene. As the moral thief breaks away, Salvation
Nell falls on her coal-scuttle bonnet and, madiy clutching
the che-ild, cries: “Pray, Pray for the Soul of your
daddy as you never prayed before. PRAY 1 ” Then
comes the last act —the Harmy in the street, brass
band, blood and fire, and Nell giving the “ I-used-to-be-
a-nawful-sinner ” testimony. Under the gaslight, the
conscience-stricken burglar! Something, he knew not
what, has turned his jemmy sour on him. Nell
is saying “ Gome home ! ” Suddenly the repentant hum
flops into the ring, and Nell holds him in her arms, while
the peanut stalls yell “ Bosker” and “Stand off me
feet,” at one and the same time. One ’Frisco paper said,
“Theaudience looked like the Sacramento in flood.” I
never saw the Sacramento, but taking one thing with
another, I suspect it must be about as enormous as the
Cotter.
Some Amurkan magnates are attempting to cheapen
the elevated drama. They have built a new theatre in
N’York, where they will present the works of those
dramatists who tuckpoint the stones in one’s mental
arch. The idea is to provide brainier brain-foods for the
working-classes. It is held that the crowd has been too
long neglected, and should have a chance to develop its
faculties. Wherefore, N’Yark workmen will now be
urged to come and digest Shakspeare, Ibsen, Maeterlinck
and others, at prices ranging from 2s. to sd. !
“Stargazer”: Managerial opposition to the registra-
tion of the Theatrical Choristers’ Association under the
“ The Whip,” at Her
Majesty’s, Melbourne.
The Villainess.
Commonwealth Act was
based on the argument
that stage hands, baliet
girls, show girls and
chorus singers are mem-
bers of a profession, and
not industrial workers
within the meaning of the
Act. They are wages hands,
subject to all the evils of un-
restricted competition ; and
the need of unionism and what
privileges the law extends to
recognised unions is as strong
in their case as in that of any
toilers and moilers in the
country. The professional dig-
nity with which the boss is
willing to invest them in court
doesn’t cut any ice in the
theatre ; it doesn’t carry pro-
fessional status and a profes-
sional screw to Bill who yaps
with the crowd, or Flo who
kicks in common with a large
flock. The combined choristers
seek to improve their condi-
tion, and the gifted manage-
ment says, “Very well, we’ll
call you professionals.” What
he hates, in common with most
property holders, is the idea of any improvements he may
be called on to pay for.
“ Sceneshifter” : Melbourne’s present epidemic of suc-
cessful racing plays recalls that the show with a gee-gee in
it has mostly been a money-spinner. The race effect in
“The Whip” was witnessed years ago by packed houses
in “The County Fair,” also in the short-lived “Ben
Hur.” Bland Holt put on all the Drury-lane racing plays
in Australia, to his own great profit, being particularly
successful with “The Derby Winner,” “A Million of
Money,” “ A Run of Luck,” and “ The Prodigal Daughter."
An Adelphi horror, “ For England,” was another useful
Bland Holt horse-show. It featured an exciting and
risky steeplechase. Dion Boucicault was the forerunner
of sporting plays, in his “Flying Scud,” and he was fol-
lowed up by Macdermott in his drama in “seven fur-
longs,” yclept “ Racing.” It is recorded somewhere that
the London Covent Garden season of 1810-11 brought in
£lOO,OOO through the attraction of stage-horses.
“ A.C.G.” : From the Launceston (Tas.) Examiner’s
telegrams :—“ The Zeehan Caledonian Society held a suc-
cessful haggis supper at the Temperance Hall to-night.”

But there’s better to come. On most unreliable authority
I hear that next Burns anniversary is to be celebrated by

“ Stony ” : Once in a while, a happy little unrehearsed
effect makes the playgoer feel that, he has got his dollar’s
worth. At a Melbourne playhouse, the other night, an
imported stage lady of effervescent and mischievous tem-
perament, blest with a fat and corifidence-giving part,
allowed her buoyant spirits to brim over. They brimmed
over upon a less favored stage-sister, who found herself
teased and tickled throughout the first two acts, when-
ever the ebullient one had a few unoccupied moments.
Sister, whose chief job was to stand around and look nice,
bore with the public tweakings for some time, having a
certain affection for the few weekly shillings her job
brings ; but at length her independent Australian nature
got working, and she slapped the “ vivacious” actress a
good, meaty slap, and bounded weeping off the stage.
Strange as it may seem to all lovers of justice and fair
play for imported mimes, the Australian girleen has not
been sacked.
Estella Stead, daughter of Holy Stead, is making her
theatrical d6but at the Little Theatre, London. The
Little Theatre is London’s latest lilliputian. Erected on
the site of old Coutts’s Bank, it will only contain stalls
and boxes. Its policy, as announced, will be to build up
a clientele of superiah people. To this end the manager
ess, Miss Gertrude Kingston, will periodically turn on
Shaw, Barker, Barrie and such-like. Miss Kingston, like
Miss A. E. F. Horniman, of the Gaiety Theatre, Man-
chester, is a lady who treads water in the stream of new,
liberated thought.
“ Sil ” : The curse of the theatrical encore is getting no
better. It is a thing of evil, which kills Art, and slays
Romance. Gus escorts Geraldine to the theatre. After
wading successfully through the preliminaries, the plot
coagulates, until the climax is reached, where the pore
betrayed girl is murdered by the villain. She staggers
round for a time, mortally wounded, and dies to slow
music, as the curtain softly descends to hide her cold,
stiffening body. Then Gus squeezes Geraldine’s hand
and sighs,'while Geraldine sniffs, and tries to swallow the
lump in her throat; and all is sweet, gentle melancholy,
and snuffles and Romance. But the fiends in the wings
suddenly get busy, and run the curtain up again, and the
corpse trips on and smirks and bows and nods to the
baldheaded man in the second row who is making frantic
supper-signals, while the murderer comes on and holds
the hand of the remains, and leers. Then Geraldine feels
foolish, and Gus scowls. Romance is dead —killed by the
yells and whistles of those poor, soulless clods who
demand an encore.
“ 5.,9.” : Bernard Shaw and Granville Barker, are taking
the Coronet Theatre, London, intending to make money
without the usual theatrical manager and the familiar
theatrical methods. They will stage plays of their own
making, and others that please them, and Shaw says he
at least hopes that one theatre may be something more
than a mere accessory to a pub.
Carden Wilson, one of the best “imitators" Australia
has produced, has tired of that bu-iness, and is putting
his mimicry into a playlet written for him by Ivan Levy,
of Wellington (M.L.) Times. The sketch, now ambling
through M.L. halls, demands that Wilson shall be four
different male people ; and the management is being-
called on to frequently take its oath that Carden is one
actor, as the bills allege, and not the four that he seems
to be.
“ U.S.” : Dorothy Nicholson is the star of the American
Biograph Co., and hundreds of thousands in Australia
have seen herin dozens of “ sketches.” Says the Penman :
“ I won’t ask how much you make a week.” Dolly : “If
you did I wouldn’t put you wise. I know my value.
Don’t I perform in thousands upon thousands of shows
all over the world every night?” Penman : “ Itis such a
treat to hear you speak.” Dolly: “ When we began at it
the director and operator said, ‘Talk 1 Talk 1’ We said,
‘ What’s the use?’but soon perceived it was necessary,
so our pieces are written out by the best authors, with
dialogue. Yet we put in the best little snatches by way
of gag.” Penman: “Ido so like your little cries, pre-
ceded by the petulant pout.” Dolly : “Of all the inveig-
lers, you’re the one. Why don’t we have an operator in
front now?” Penman: “Goodness gracious, there may
be.” Dolly: “ ‘ The Biograph Girl and the Press’! Oh,that
would go down.” Penman: “Do you know the per-
formers of the Vitagraph Company?” Dolly: “Bless
you, we haven’t time to know anybody. All on the
Dollar. We won’t be young and beautiful for ever.”
The door-keeper’s story: “A Blandolt drammer was
under weigh. There was a long comedy scene in a
kitchen in which several characters got woefully involved
with the soubrette’s dough. The dough business was a
great success. You can always knock a melodrama
audience with a bit of dough, but in this piece half a
bucket of the stuff was used. The gallery laughed
its head off when Bland Holt trapped his rival in
a wire entanglement of dough. We on the doors
noticed one chap in particular, a short, puggy man
in a light suit, who came night after night into a stalls
seat, and nearly guffawed himself into fits. He put on a
man-of-the-house sort of air, and swaggered round in the
intervals. We got quite familiar with him, and one
night (I think it must have been his twentieth visit) I
asked him what was the great attraction. ‘What!’he
said. ‘Don’t you know? Mean to say you ain’t heard
who I am ? Why, I’m the bloke that makes the dough !’ ”
“Lantana”: An interesting-souvenir of Nell GWynne
will shortly come under the hammer in London. Amongst
the orange lady’s many accomplishments writing was not
included; but she eventually, and with considerable
difficult}', learned to sign her initials. The curio, referred
to is a receipt, dated July 16, 1683. It is for £5OO, being
one quarter’s instalment of an annuitj' granted by
Charles 11. to his lady love for her own maintenance and
the support of her family, including her son, the Earl of
Burford, who subsequently became Duke of St. Albans.
On the faded folio page it can still be seen that someone
pencilled the initials for the lady’s guidance before she
laboriously inked in her “E.G.”
Hugh Ward has bought into the J. C. Williamson firm.
He was just the man that was needed to fill the experi-
enced footwear of .1.0. W., who must shortly retire from
strenuous toil. Ward knows the theatrical side of the
business from A to Z ; the cash-management of the con-
cern is going to be all right (though in this regard it is a
pity from the firm’s viewpoint that Rainaciotti is drop-
ping out) ; and the influx of the Allen family brings in a
helpful social element. Altogether, and despite competi-
tion, J.C.W. and Co. should go on booming.
A WORTHY CITIZEN ANSWERS QUESTIONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Amongst the questions to be asked for the census-
papers are : The amount of rent paid; the daily wage;
the number of hours worked; the amount of money
possessed, and whether the individual is a total ab-
stainer.
Dear Mr. Canvasser, I may not be
At home when you call round. The census-paper
I’ll fill in now, that you and all may see
I’m conscientious ; no unseemly caper
Shall I be guilty of, like some rude folk
Who look upon the census as a joke.
Question the first, re rent: I’m solid there ;
An ordinary rent; if you will, double—
You can approximately gauge m}' share
Of that big burden ; then, without much trouble,
Guess that, though for a house in town I pay,
I’m rarely there—“ on tour” at pubs I stayi*
The daily wage? I scorn the vulgar phrase !
With “ salary ” I always am rewarded ;
But—my profession has its funny ways— !
The real amount has never been recorded.
Get at it thus : ask anyone my “ screw,”
And what you’re toldyitsf halve —the half is true.
The hours I work ? Good Lord, why all the lot!
I can’t conceive of any when I’m idle ;
No Union cares for me a blessed jot;
(Sometimes I slave in manner suicidal.
Though I will speak a paradox and say—
“ Playing I’m working, and my work is play 1 ”
Next question on the paper : “What amount
Of money have I in my own possession?”
Money to burn, sir, more than I can count,
Mainly in notes—the “ props ” of my profession !
Total abstainer? Sir, what do you think?
You dare to ask a mummer does he drink !

To j'ou I sped, hard cash in eager grip,

One gift at least—the faculty to do
An instantaneous change.
But why so long to shift your scanty dress?
I’ve often changed a collar-stud in less.

One matter overlooked was the blushful pictorial
catalogues issued by the big drapery firms. The
nude is cold and calm compared with the rap-
turous display of female that adorns the erect-
form sale notice or a next-to-skin, fit-all-round
garment. I once saw a pair of hose so generously
depicted in the Watchman that I haven’t taken
the paper since. Either the stockings advt.
should be prohibited or stockings should be made
longer.
The incompetent housebreaker has a hard
crib to crack. When a politician or a railway
boss makes a mess of things, various excited people
rise up, throw bouquets, cheer and get indignant
with the sober majority. But no one cheers for
the burglar who falls over his own feet. The in-
competent who tried to loot Gaunt’s, in Bourke-
street (Melb.) last week, but smashed a pane of
glass, and brought down an avalanche of police,
chattered to the reporters after his capture like
a hobble-skirter at a political meeting. If
his yarn is right, he has a genius for
being caught and gaoled for long periods in
a dull, stodgy way. He is not the sort of des-
perado who uses a sandbag or revolver. He
merely secretes himself in a dust-box and waits for
the place to be shut up. He doesn’t take the
precaution of disguising himself beforehand as a
bad banana or an old boot; he just crouches down
like the Pri Secretary in the trunk; and if any-
one comes along to throw out a last shovelful
of sweepings before closing time he is discovered
and lost, like the wretched curate in the third act.
The Melbourne police didn’t know he was oper-
ating until he gave the alarm himself; and they
didn’t catch him until one of the searching Johns
felt him wriggling under his feet like an indignant
reptile. Henceforth promotion in the force should
be by the size of boots worn. Obviously, the man
with the largest feet stands the best chance of
trampling on the lurking criminal.

“The Pariah ” : In B. 20/10/T0 there is a
warning to the white woman who contemplates
marrying an Asiastic. Mrs. Dost Mahommed is
one of the lucky ones—she’s dead. During a stay
of over two years in Southern China, I saw some
—and heard of more—of the unluckier live ones.
The most talked-of case was that of a Melbourne
woman, who at last, in 1907, was helped to
escape by a Customs officer (white). It was her
second attempt that was successful. The first
resulted in the loss of her left breast. Women
who go “home” with their Chinese husbands
generally find two or three previous wives. The
white woman has to be the slave of these. Fre-
quently, also, she has to work side by side with
the men in the field, from daylight to dark.
The “ house ” is generally a 10 x 12 x 7ft. shack of
stone or bamboo and mud. In this the usually
numerous family feeds, smokes and dosses. The
mere attempt to talk with a foreigner brings
punishment, such as a flogging, or the loss of a
breast, ear or nose. Rarely a hand, because that
would render the woman of little value as a beast
of the field. All sorts of reasons are advanced to
explain the attraction a Chow has for some white
women. The one nearest the mark was suggested
by The Bulletin in the Elsie Siegel case, i.e., a
■desire for erotic rioting in the first instance ; and
the frequenting of Asiatic haunts for that purpose
quickly brings about degradation too horrible to
think about.

“The Traveller” : The Victorian railway
bosses stated the other day that the engine-drivers
had regulations for observ-
ing speed limits, but that it
was impossible to always
say how far the regulations
were broken. Apart from
the dirty insinuation, herein
contained, that past acci-
dents may have occurred
tliusly, and that future ones
be due to the same
cause, the statement is
wrong, anyhow. A few
locomotives have speed-
recorders fixed upon them.
All the engines could pro-
bably be fitted with the
same in a very short time,
if the officers desired it.
But apparently they don’t
desire it ; for while they
are not so fitted, the above-
mentioned dirty insinua-
tion may help to cover up a
multitude of shortcomings
in roads and rolling stock.
And, while on the subject, what is the matter
with making speed-recorders as compulsory as
numbers on motor-cars? The tell-tale tape of
the recorder would make much hard swearing
unfashionable and useless.

The law has a marvellous sympathy for
the dishonest trader. In Melbourne recently a
man put on the market a bogus or forged or
counterfeit cow. He advertised it, and sold it for
£7, as a creature which gave 16 quarts of milk
daily, whereas its limit was about four quarts.
Therefore three-fourths of the money (£5 55.) was
obtained by fraud. If the dealer had forged a
cheque instead of a cow, for £5 55., or if he had
passed £7 worth of base money, worth only 355.,
instead of passing £7 worth of base heifer, or if
he had got the. money by breaking into a house
instead of breaking out in print, he would pro-
bably have got three years. But the blessed
trader is privileged—Heaven only knows why.
The man with the illicit cow got seven days, and
as the sentence was dated back about two weeks
he really got nothing. Perhaps he may now sue
the authorities for keeping him in confinement
after the expiration of his term.
If the Westralian police keep on digging
up the country around Perth in search of Ethel
Harris, they will probably end by finding
Crippen’s third wife. It is always the unexpected
that happens.
THE ATTRACTION.
THE OLD ROUE : “ There's some-
thing about young Jones that
I admire."
HIS FRIEND (cynically): “His wife, probably.”
“ Gak’s ” solemn warning :
Last week I noticed a foot or so of lace escaping at the
pavement end of a lady, and in a fatherly spirit I drew
her attention to the runaway. She thanked me by ask-
ing me to hold her parcels while she fixed it. Just
then up came a perspiring person, at sight of whom the
lady shrieked and fled. The perspiring person and I fol-
lowed, but for different reasons. Finding himself out-
distanced, the perspiring person stood on the trailing
lace ; but the strain on the running-end did not let up
until the lady had Sprinted round two blocks. I then
learned that the perspiring person was a shopwalker,
while tire lady in the case was a well-known shoplifter ;
also, I was accused of being her accomplice. It took me
20 minutes to stall off the police. After this, when I see
a girl’s garter winking indelicately I’ll let it do its worst.

The Victorian honorarium’s persistent
habit of fining the furious tjo-
torist the same old ten shillings
lately got on the nerves of Fern
Tree Gully shire council, and
it passed a by-law prohibiting
“honkers” from using the
winding tracks through the
ferny gullies and over the
ranges. This being declared
ultra vires, the council has now
asked the Governor-in-Council
to do the job, as authorised by
the Motor Car Act; if he won’t,
the council swears it will “re-
gulate” such traffic to one mile
an hour, and will collect as
much in fines as it now pays
in rates. Also, Lilydale is
bitter and threatens to correct
the furious motorist by putting
gutters across the road at
unexpected places. Another
plan would be to leave flocks of
cows grazing casually about
the thoroughfares. The cow
is a fairly solid animal of
gradual habit, whose main
idea when anything swift
happens along is to stand and
inspect it, and then bolt
frantically in the unexpected
direction. It might be awk-
ward for the cows; but at
lease they wouldn’t be spoiled
for sausage meat.
At Bathurst (N.S.W.) one small Wowser
has been causing more blasphemy than 14 teams
of bullocks. Some time ago he applied himself to
the forlorn-hope job of checking the use of
“language” in and around the local saleyards. To
that end he engineered the attendance of a police-
man while the auctioneers were doing business.
The first to be gathered in was Major Cassidy,
the oldest working auctioneer in N.S.W., if
not in the world, and an undefeated sports-
man. The Major attended at the police-
court armed with two things—a cheque ready
drawn out for the fine, and harsh words anent
the snuffle-busting tendencies of the 20th cen-
tury. Other convictions followed. Last Friday
one Christopher Hade was fined the usual amount
for saying, while striving to sell a pen of cattle,
“Surely to God they are worth something.’’. In
Bathurst, which considers that it has something
of a reputation to sustain for fruity, full-blooded
cursing, the above development is regarded as the
dead finish.
Ever since the oldest inhabitant can re-
member, the Turk has been going to reform and
live cleanly and be a decent member of the Euro-
pean family. In fact, after the Crimean war it
was understood that he had reformed, and was
never going on the bloodstained jag any more.
England then got one of its hysterical attacks of
hero worship about him, for Bull is always either
violently hating or violently admiring somebody.
He worshipped the French in the early days of
Nap. 111., and the Germans in ’7O and ’7l, and the
Turks about ’56, and the Japs more recently; and
he found every one of them perfect and surpass-
ingly beautiful in turn. The Ottoman got his

turn again after the recent revolution, and the
Perfect Turk was expected to evolve at last. But,
apparently, the object of admiration is the
same old futile Asiatic as before. He commenced
the new order of things by clearing some 20,000
stray dogs out of Constantinople, but being the
usual procrastinating cuss he left them on an
island to be killed next month, and Europe was
shocked at the news of 20,000 dogs eating each
other alive in the name of Progress. The old per-
secutions and judicial murders resumed in Mace-
donia, and the old row started afresh on the
Greek border, and the old tortures and steals and
frauds are heard of in the old places. Also the old
filibustering army corps has just gone howling
over the Persian border. The trouble seems to
be that the Turk is just a Turk, and never intends
to be anything else.
OUR FATHER OF WATERS!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The contour plan of the Federal capital area has been
completed, and will be presented to the House of Repre-
sentatives early this week. The map has been prepared
for purposes of com,petition for the laying out of the
capital city, which is quite apart from the designs of the
buildings themselves. The Molonglo River is shown
running through the site. —S. M. Herald.
Have you heard of our “Father of Waters” —
The Wonderful River we own?
According to story it passes in glory
The Thames and the Rhine and the Rhone !
It is deep, it is blue, it is mystic,
And clear as a river of glass—
In fact, it is characteristic
Of Canberra-Yass !
Prate not of La Plata or Niger,
Allude not to great Paraguay ;
Speak not of Zambesi—this stream beats it easy ;
At least, so our newspapers say.
Let Brazil for her vast Amazon glow
With pride in its length and its mass—
We will boast of the mighty Molonglo
At Canberra-Yass !
The Yang-Tse-Kiang and the Obi
The Danube, the Indus, the Nile,
And the huge Hoang-Ho are big rivers, we know;
But speak not of them, 1 lest we smile !
Though millions may dwell on their marges,
And dozens of cities they pass—
Do you know what our river discharges
At Canberra-Yass?
We tell you the flow is enormous !
We count it by millions of tons—
It bursts through a valley that staggered O’Malley—
And, listen —our river, it runs !
The water is cool, sweet and bracing,
And sparkles with natural gas—
You’ll find it all shoivn on the t racing
Of Canberra-Yass !

LAST year we introduced a line of Light Blue
Underwear that became very popular and
proved itself ideal for the hot season.
The texture is the very lightest, but all pure
wool—the bottoms and sleeve ends are ribbed against
unravelling—and the seams are all fashioned so as to
cause no friction or irritation on the skin.
Every garment we sell carries a guarantee that if
it shrinks at all in the wash we will replace it with
a new one.
The price is one that will appeal to keen buyers.

Curious and otherwise interesting infor-
mation from the Ma State’s vital statistics for
1909 :
Two boys of 15 tied for the youngest bridegroomship.
One married a girl of 21; the other a girl of 22. Or per-
haps the girls married the boys. The records make no
comment.
The two oldest bridegrooms were 80 and 84. One
married a girl of 21.
The most popular ages for men to marry were 23, 24
and 25 ; for girls, 21, 22 and 23.
The youngest bride of the year was 13. She married a
boy of 18. There were two brides of 14, and 30 of 15
years.
According to the records, after a woman passes 40 her
chances of marriage are reduced by about half until she
reaches an age between 50 and 64. Her chances then
appear to improve.
Twenty-three Chows took to their kennels 22 Austra-
lian-born girls and one English girl.
The Church of England headed the marriage poll with
6304 splicings ; the R. O. Church was second with 2345 ;
the Presbyterian third with 1691 ; and the Methodist
chapel fourth with 1464.
Two husbands between the ages of 80 and 84 registered
the birth of children.
v There were two mothers aged 14. More women were
mothers at 24 than at any other age. In the case of ille-
gitimate children there were more mothers at 20.
Three first births happened after 18 years of marriage.
Over a 10 years’ range Death worked hardest in the
months of December and January—January particularly.
In February and March the Scythe did less reaping than
it any other period. It might advance as an excuse that
those two months were the favorites for suicide.
A most alarming feature is that last year cancer killed
more people than in any year back as far as 1876 (the
records go no farther). For every million of popula-
tion 718 died of the horror, an increase of 147 per million
in 10 years.

About once in every 10 days one or other
of the evening papers rushes out with a graphic
account of some council-chamber scene, and ex-
eitedly retails it to the weary homing rate-
payer as “news.” The ratepayer struggles
down the column or so of shrieks, threats,
itnprecations and interjections, and notes
that the turmoil finally ended with a
yell of “Shut up, you ginger hound !”
and the retirement of Alderman Squeal
in front of the policeman Who had been
summoned by the Mayor. Then the
ratepayer sits back and wonders how
many council dog-fights of the kind go
unrecorded, and what grade of man
is running his suburb while he is
away earning his living in the city.
Occasionally he remembers other muni-
cipal episodes—such as the dead dog
that remained unburied at North Syd-
ney because it had breathed its last
whilst lying across the border-line of two
suburbs, and neither council was willing
to bury the other council’s half of the
corpse along with its own. These re-
flections make him wonder what has be-
come of the Greater Sydney movement.
He feels that the Unburied Dog and Gin-
ger Hound sy stem of doing things or leaving
them undone is out of date, and he begins to
yearn for something larger, with more method
and civility about it and a few ideas of public
sanitation. Where has the Greater Sydney move-
ment got to ?
WHERE THE OTHER BEAST SCORED.
OLD SPORT: “I believe you think more of your horse than you do of me .”
YOUNG WIFE: “ Well, my horse doesn't object to my holding the reins."
The other day the 22 municipal councils
of Melbourne were invited to consider a large
scheme for turning the Yarra into a beautiful
waterway, with drives and parks alongside, a lake
up near Heidelberg, and other joyful items. The
councillors viewed the scheme woodenly for a
while ; then Essendon wanted to know where its
neighbor,' the Saltwater River, came in, and
Northcote asked why the Merri Creek had been
overlooked, and Haw-hawthorn inquired what its
main drain had done. At least, it would have
asked if that main drain were not a sore subject
in the council since that body went to law over it
and sustained heavy damages, with Costs. So
the Yarra improvement scheme is hung up, and
is likely to stay that way.
THINGS WE SEE.
In view of recent Victorian railway hap-
penings, S. Aus. is congratulating itself on its
bloodless record. It has quite a lot of lines, yet
it cannot remember ever having killed a pas-
senger—with one notable exception. This was
J. G. Ramsay, a prominent politician in his time,
who was fatally burned about 15 years ago by the
bursting of an overhead oil lamp in the carriage
where he sat alone ; and that was a case so strange
that probably it comes under the class which
lawyers and insurance men debit direct to Pro-
vidence.
“D.” on Crippen, Poison and Sudden
Death :
A British jury has found Hawley Crippen’s explanation
of his wife’s disappearance too thin, and so he is booked
for the Golden Shore. He will be remembered not only
as the first murderer who was caught by wireless tele-
graphy, but as the first convicted poisoner who used
hyoscine.
Like so many other notable poisoners, he was by way of
being a medical man. To cite some cases : Dr. Lamson
slew Percy Malcolm John by means of aconitine ; Dr.
Pritchard accounted for his plain and elderly wife with
antimony ; while Dr. Palmer murdered John Parsons Cook
with strychnine. Crippen probably used hyoscine merely
to put his subject to sleep. It is likely that, having got
her safely “off,” he shot her with the revolver that was
found at Hilldrop Crescent. He was a mild little male-
factor who loathed noise. The howls of one in the pangs
of (say) strychnine poisoning would have pained him. So
Mrs. Crippen was given an anaesthetic to make the Last
Operation easier—for the operator.
Few murderers have been more elaborate in the matter
of precautions than Crippen. And yet, like the rest of
the tribe, he fell in hopelessly on details. It was foolish
to give Le Neve deceased’s ciothes and jewellery ; to let
her wear them among the dead woman’s friends was
madness. What finally settled him was a pyjama coat
which the lady had presumably been wearing when she
received the death-stroke, and which he buried with the
remains. The only part of the garment that escaped
destruction bore the maker’s name. “At the last
moment,” to quote the cable message, “the draper who
had sold the pyjamas to Crippen came to court and
identified the fragment of coat on oath.” After that,
any faint shadow of doubt that rested in the jury’s mind
must have fled.
According to the pleasing custom that still prevails in
England, Crippen will meet with what is known as
“ poetic justice.” He tried to burn his wife’s bodj r . And
of him it may shortly be said, as it was of “C.T.W.,
sometime trooper of the Royal Horse Guards ” :
“ Deep down below a prison yard,
Naked for greater shame,
He lies with fetters on each foot,
Wrapt in a sheet of flame.
“ And all the while the burning lime
Eats flesh and bone away ;
It eats the brittle bone by night,
And the soft flesh by day.”

Melbourne City Council is lacking even in
ordinary Fatman reverence for historic names.
Last week it decided to change Kyte’s-lane, a
narrow thoroughfare between Bourke-street and
Lillybuck-street, into Payne’s-place, although by
this other name the lane will smell no sweeter.
Two or three fathers protested against this snob-
bish idea of obliterating the dead Kyte in order to
“do honor ”to a live Payne. One man remarked
that “some of Melbourne’s best citizens” had
abided in the lane or thereabouts in the long ago,
himself among the number. Another historian
referred to the fact that Ambrose Kyte subscribed
£lOOO to the Burke and Wills expedition, and
practically started the exploration movement.
But the majority of the councilors cared nothing
for Kyte or his works, and were bent on butter-
ing Payne; so the ancient by-way is to be re-
christened.

“ Bloggs ” : Another Sydney citizen—a
youngster this time—basslipped into an open sewer
in a suburban street and been swept away by storm-
waters and drowned. Why should there be open
sewers, or if they must exist why isn’t the proper
authority made to rail them in like precipices and
similar dangerous features of the landscape? The
writer lives in the neighborhood of one of these
death-traps, and never passes it without a
shudder. Of course, no normal person yearns to
meet Death anywhere—even at the foot of a clean,
dry, airy and unscented cliff or precipice. But
death in a sewer is over the odds. Attached to'
my will is a codicil, directing that if I reach my
latter end that way the beneficiaries shall seize-
the mayor and aldermen of the parish where the-
tragedy occurs and smear them from head to foot,
with assafeetida. Failing which, my savings go-
to a Society for Constructing Sewers in a Rational!
Manner.
“ Fleeing from Gaol ” telegraphs :
The King-, represented by a Sydney henchman named!
Sybye, is chivvying a Dago named Kourvais round a
bottle of beer. This Kourvais is a respectable Dago, who-
sella da steak and da o.vst in a King-street shop, and
holds George V.’s permission to sella till midnight. One
evening a customer rolled in after 11.30 and said, “ Bringa
da oyst.” He got his oysters, produced a bottle of beer
from under his hat or somewhere and proceeded to
moisten up. Sobye, a Liquor Act inspector, here inter-
vened ; but instead of arresting the beer or remonstrat-
ing with the customer, he writted the Dago for having a
person (meaning the bloke who brought beer) on his pre-
mises after 11 p.m. for an unlawful purpose—to wit, the
drinking of beer. Naturally, the aggrieved Dago an-
swered that the unknown bloke was there for the purpose
of eating oysters, which, by the law made and provided,
was a lawful and reverent purpose up to midnight. The
magistrate afterwards held this contention quite sound,
and dismissed the information ; but the Crown Law
Office, finding time hang heavy on its hands while Wade
was busy electioneering, decided to take the case to the
Full Court, although the point had been practically de-
cided before in the celebrated Lynch case, where the High
Court ruled that the publican was not to blame becausi
men in the hotel for a lawful purpose— i.e., to go to bed-
indulged, unknown to, or unassisted publican,,
in unlawful gaming. Here, apparently, there is a slight!
difference. Kourvais saw the man drinking his beer, andi
by merely looking on tacitly consented to him doing so ;;
but had he caught the customer by the throat to prevent,
the beer going down, the Crown Law Office would theni
have got up steam and hauled him to a magistrate, who-
would probably have concluded an address on the ferocity
of foreigners by handing him three months’ hard for un-
provoked assault. As the law stands, a man may buy-
beer in a pub and take it away to drink in the-
street or park or at home. If, on his way
home, he decides to have supper in town, he cam
do one of three things with the bottle: (1) Leave-
it in his pocket; (2) drink its contents in the supper-
room, and |allow a prosecution to fall on the proprietor
(3) leave it on the doorstep, and go into the street occa-
sionally to have a nip. If he takes the last-mentionedl
course he risks: (1) the loss of the bottle during the time-
he is inside ; (2) the loss of his supper during the time hei
is outside. The best course seems to be to (1) buy a bog:
of oysters from the Dago ; (2) borrow an opener, a camp>
stool and a corkscrew ; (3) take up quarters on the kerb-
stone opposite the Crown Law office ; (4) drink the beer;
(5) swallow the oysters ; (6) throw the shells through the
Crown Law windows ; (7) hang the dead marine to the
door-bell.

As soon as this State awakens to the miscarriage of
justice in freeing Phillips from the death-penalty, I think
every right-thinking man, woman and child will be up in
arms against this second strange act of the new Attorney-
General. I must confess that I voted for Labor ; not
that I properly understood what I was voting for, but I
thought that the country would be all the better for a
change. Anyhow, never again.—“ A Woman ” on
Phillips’s case.
If, in the future, a murderer is to be leniently dealt
with, I am much afraid that it will lead to the public
taking the law into their own hands, and doing as they
have done, and do still, in America. — “Mother" on
Phillips’s case.
If Labor is opposed on principle to capital punishment
it should have the courage to say so. This decision prac-
tically means the abolition of the death penalty.—S. M...
Herald on reprieve of murderer Phillips.

Mark the Herald’s frantic pother ;
Note “ A Woman’s ” bogus terror ;

This is Labor domination
In its vilest form. Damnation

From their clutches. View their swollfeni
Eyes of hate —

Faced the women, blood outpouring;

The form of the annual report and accounts of the Gold-
fields Water Supply Administration is now as good as
formerly it was bad; and the secretary and accountant
deserve the thanks of everybody whose job it is
to get a clear view of the Board’s transactions.
The arrangement is not too good, and the re-
sults are still pretty poor, but that is not the
fault of these officers. The main works, planned by Big-
john Forrest, and paid for by loans raised by the
Treasury, cost £2,866,454. This debt was not transferred
to the YVater Supply Board ; but the capital required for
supplementary works—£37l,o42—was raised on deben-
tures by the Board. The interest on the main debt is
therefore paid by the Treasury, and on the supplementary
debt by the Board. Bigjohn Forrest, who is a statesman
in flashes, never did a wiser thing than when he provided
that the money borrowed for this work should carry
a sinking fund, calculated to extinguish the debt
in something under 26 years. He had two solid
reasons—(l) the goldfields couldn’t last for ever ;
(2) the works couldn’t last for ever either. It was ex-
pected that the users of the water, mostly big and rich
absentees, would pay interest and sinking fund. They
promptly set to work to pull strings, and the charges
were cut down so outrageously that, as shown above,
the net revenue in 1908 fell £90,597 short of the amount
necessary.
Not only did tho consumers provide no sinking
fund whatever, but, as can be ascertained from the next
table, they have rarely paid the interest :
Sinking

1904 .. £83,952 £71,959 £155,911
1905 .. 94,792 84,240 179,032
1906 .. 96,565 85,152 181,717

1909 .. 103,395 87,844 191,239
1910 .. 102,982 89,153 192,135
By a comparison of the sinking fund required (table 2) and
the actual deficit (table 1), it will be seen that mostly the
deficit has exceeded the amount required as a sinking
fund instalment. Westralia has, however, a Board which
sees that the contributions to its sinking funds are made.
What has happened, therefore, is that the sinking fund
which ought to have been provided by the consumers
bus been made up out of general revenue (taxes, etc.).
But as the general revenue has not been sufficient to meet
the expenditure (including sinking fund contributions),
there has been a regular State deficit, which of course
has been made good by temporary borrowings. So in the
last resort the sinking fund to extinguish a loan has been
provided out of other loans, which is a most ridiculous
state of affairs.
The absurdity, not to say the dishonesty of it,
appealed to the Newton Moore Government about 12
months ago; and to the credit of that Government it
decided to stop some of the shameful subsidy to the great
goldfield companies. The price of water was put up
about 33 per cent. ; where previously it was ss. or ss. 3d.
per 1000 it is now 75., and where it was 6s. 3d. it is now
10s. There was the inevitable howl; but even now the
Btate subsidy to the consumers amounts, as shown above,
to over £40,000 a year ; and it is not likely to get much
below that on account of the gradually increasing charges
for repairs and maintenance. In fact, it is very doubtful
whether the most costly part of the undertaking will
last the further 16 years which it will take, at the present
rate, to accumulate a sinking fund equal to the
capital debt. The Board has no reserve for
renewals ; consequently, it will have to either charge up
renewals to working expenses or borrow to carry them
out. And obviously current revenue won’t stand very
heavy renewal charges. The unpardonable mistake —or
crime—was the reduction of the water charges in the
early days. The big users were then rolling in wealth ;
they were paying £2,000,000 a year in divs., and they
ought to have then provided, not only sinking fund and
interest, but a renewals reserve as well. In that way
they might later on, in their years of poverty, have got
water at a much reduced rate. Now there is practically
no prospect of it; for though a sinking fund is being
accumulated to pay off one lot of capital, it seems almost
certain that, probably before that lot has been paid off,
another lot will have to be borrowed to renew the works ;
and so the interest bill is never likely to shrink.

t the public’s money ; to-day it has £11,074,617. But while
lit has thus increased its debts by £3,749,757, it has only
increased its holding of coin and liquid assets by
£773,296. When it is remembered that it has put by
some surplus profits during the past 10 years, and pre-
sumably added them, or part of them, to liquid re-
serves, it will be seen that, of the new money got in
during the last 10 years, it has lent out somewhere near
five-sixths. Under those circumstances, it isn’t to be
wondered at that the profits show very considerable im-
provement. Big figures are not everything, though.
Since 1905 the advances have increased from £5,378,880
to £8,470,465 —over £3,000,000 in five years. Now,
those five years have been a period of high
values; and when a bank lends largely during a period
of high values, it is in danger of presently finding
itself jeft with a lot of troublesome babies to nurse.
There is no way of telling whether a bank, working under
such circumstances, is storing up trouble for itself or not.
No doubt it is possible to let out large sums of money
safely, even in boom times. But, in the absence of
definite knowledge, which nobody possesses on this sub-
ject, the shareholders’ greater risks must be taken into
account. So far, only the rapid improvement in profits,
dividends, and business-connection has been visible. The
possible sting in the animal’s tail will only be visible when
the slump comes.
The figures go on mounting higher :

A very satisfactory feature is the continued reduction of
the item Premises, etc. The “ etc.” means other proper-
ties; and the 10 years’comparison printed above shows
that these other properties have been reduced in that
time from £462,241 to £50,005, apparently by sales.
But there is another side to that, too—the same
side that was shown above; if it has been a fine
time to quit properties, on account of high prices ruling,
it has also been a fine time to make future bad debts by
advancing on other properties at a high level of values.
There has been an unusually big increase in advances
during the past year ; yet the cash position, though not
as strong as it was 10 years ago, is nevertheless still
satisfactory. The liquid assets represent 36 per cent, of
all the bank’s debts. And, though the deposits and other
debts have increased so much, they still represent no
more than £6 6s. sd. per £1 of the capital and reserves.
That is to say, there is £6 6s. ss. of the public’s money in
the business for every £1 that belongs to the share-
holders. Though there can be no fixed rule on the sub-
ject, £7 to £1 is reckoned by many as just about as far as
a bank ought to go. Considering the National is not very
far from that limit, the rate of profits calculated on the
basis on capital and reserves combined is not very large :

A comparatively small rate of earnings may, however,
mean various things: (1) The bank (or whatever other
co. it may be) may be strengthening its internal reserves,
and not showing all its actual profits. (2) It may have a
quantity of unproductive assets, and it may also be using
some of its profits to write those assets down. (3) It may
be taking only the very best and least risky class of
securities, and that sort never carries a high rate. There
is no telling from a balance-sheet which of these three
explanations apply. One can only look at the past
and guess.

This unfortunate co. is again in trouble. For many years
past it has been suspected that the directors told the
shareholders no more than they thought it was good for
the public to know. Now, for some reason or other, they
have called in a constable and made a confession, which
• has been taken down in writing and may be used against
them at their trial. Thus runs the confession : “ Our
investments in Fiji have been practically paid for out of
profits. In other words, we have been able over this
period (15 years) to let these profits accumulate, and to
use them in developing interests which could hardly have
been taken up as a separate speculation, though they
are now of much value.” Which means that for 15 years
past the co. has been much under-stating its profits.
Some innocent shareholders probably thought that the
figures meant what they said, and in that belief parted
with their shares. Now the directors announce that
the figures didn’t tell all the truth, but that
profits were “accumulated”; and one result is
that £150,000 is now to be distributed in the
way of a special bonus. No doubt the directors
have a perfect legal right to do all they have
done and are doing ; but there are times when we hear a
good deal about the poor widow, and The Bulletin is
wondering what the poor widow feels like, supposing she
sold her few shares and now finds that the business was
making profits which her directors never mentioned to
her, and which somebody else is now going to pocket.
As the table shows, this is not the first time the
harassed directors have had a few .thousands that they
didn’t know what to do with. Only a couple of years
ago £350,000 suddenly materialised, and a year before
that £75,000 ; so that, in three years, besides getting their
10 per cent, div., shareholders have had or will have re-
ceived £575,000. The capital will, with the present addi-
tion, be £3,000,000. Even if no other part of the capital
except the £575,000 just mentioned had been paid out of
profits, the 10 per cent, would really be equal Do 12J per
cent. And it is just as certain as anything can be that,
even now, the assets are ridiculously undervalued. Lust
half-year the total net assets produced a profit at the rate
of no less than £l2 Bs. 9d. per cent, per annum. If the
assets, including buildings, investments, etc., were capi-
talised on a very liberal 8 per cent, basis, they would
represent about £4,875,000; and in that case, instead of
having poor little reserves of £170,000, the real reserves
d’ould be £2,025,000 ; and that is probably nearer the
mark than the figures in the published accounts.
The future of the prodigious co. must always be
in doubt. Profits such as this co. has made can be made
only out of two parties—producers and consumers.
There is practically no export trade; so, insofar as the
profits are made out of consumers, they are made out of
Australian consumers—Australia for this purpose
including Maoriland. The co. answers that it undersells
foreign competitors. That answer will not save it : the
reply is that, if Australia is so amazingly well adapted
for the production of sugar, Australia should benefit, not
by getting sugar as cheap as other people, but by getting
it far cheaper. Trouble is more likely to come from the
producers, though. The growers are forming themselves
into unions ; and though the C.S.R. has made friends
with some of them, they begin to show their teeth. Only
the other day the Sugar Cane Grow’ers’ Union of Bunda-
berg issued a statement designed to show that, where the
growers make a profit of £7 10s. per ton (from 100 tons of
cane), the millowner and refiner (which means the C.S.R.
in most cases) makes £93 10s. The remedy most often
talked about is nationalisation. But short of nationalisa-
tion many things may happen to make the path of the
CIS.R. less rose-strewn ; the co. may stave off nationalisa-
tion ; but it may cost a big slice of its profits to do it.

This co. has done a shade better than for the previous
couple of years. Its loss rate is still heavy’, probably- on
account of extensive marine business. Yet a co. doing a
large marine business ought to show a better expense
rate than this one does. And it would, no doubt,
if it got the Australian fire business it is
fairly entitled to. But, though there is a little
business that comes to Australian offices because
they are Australian, by far the most of it has to be
fought for. Hundreds of thousands of Australians who
wouldn’t dream of giving their life insurance to any but
Australian offices don’t think twice about passing the
Australian fire office by and turning into a foreign con-
cern whose Australian assets consist of a doormat and a
few penwipers. Even Australian life-insurance offices,
which themselves appeal to Australians because they are
Australian, are among the sinners. And there are great
institutions, like the Sydney University, from which Aus-
tralian fire offices find it almost impossible to get a
“ line.” In fact, there have been cases in which, when
such institutions have lent money on mortgage, they
have scandalously stipulated that the mortgaged pro-
perty shall be insured with a co. whose profits are divided
wholly outside Australia. And it can’t be because the
Australian offices are weak. On the whole, they are far
stronger, in proportion to their risks, than the average of
the British offices. The reserves and paid capital of
the 20 leading British offices at the end of 1909
amounted to £39,695,993. The net premium income was
£24,593,223. Thus these 20 leading offices had £l6l Bs.
of funds against every £lOO of risks as represented by
premiums. But this United 00. has £247,892 of funds
against £111,906 of risks, or £221 12s. for every £lOO.
Where the average British office has £l6l Bs. to cover a
given risk, the Australian office therefore has £221 12s.
Moreover, the premium income in some of the British
offices does not include accident premiums, while the
income shown in the case of the United includes every-
thing. If it were possible to reduce the two sets of
figures to absolutely the same basis, the comparison
would consequently be still more favorable to the Aus-
tralian office.
Certainly this, in common with other Aus-
tralian cos., is making progress. The following shows,
among other things, the growth of premiums :

But part of this increase in premiums is due to the
growth of accident business ; and that, again, is mainly
due to modern legislation. The increase in expense rate
no doubt partly follows from the same cause. There is
one thing beyond the mere size of the capital reserves
in which insurers are interested : that is, the quality of
the assets. On this point, the insurer with many a foreign
office knows nothing whatever. He just trusts to luck ;
though, if he is prepared to trust to luck, there seems no
reason why he should insure at all. On the other hand,
almost anybody can ascertain the real strength of an Aus-
tralian co.’s position. This United Co. has £166,372 in-
vested in bank deposits and Government stock and de-
bentures, and a balance of nearly £lOO,OOO in freeholds
(£60,553), mortgages, till money, etc. The preponder-
ance of liquid assets, though it means comparatively
small interest earnings, is a feature which should make’
the insurer with this office sleep all the more comfortably.

These reserves are made up as follows Formal reserve
fund, £100,000; ditto for equalisation of dividends,
£lOO,OOO ; ditto for rebuilding and depreciation of securi-
ties, £125,000; unappropriated profit, £32,915. The co.
has evidently been financed on very conservative lines.
There is a reserve, it will be noticed, for rebuilding and de-
preciation of securities; but large sums have been written
off apart from this provision. Every half-year £5OOO is
deducted from disclosed profits, as a rule ; but it is highly
probable that a good deal is written off which is never
disclosed at all. Admittedly something of the kind is
done: “Profits on brewings, sales of wines, rents,” etc.,
are shown “after making provision for bad and doubtful
debts and depreciation.” Ten years ago “brewery, plant
and machinery, goodwill, rolling stock and freehold pro-
perties,” stood in the balance-sheet at £671,662. Tooth’s
haven’t stood still these last 10 years. Large additions
have been made to brewery premises and plant, and it is not
at all likely that hotel and other freehold properties are any
less numerous or valuable than they were. Yet to-day the
same item stands at the reduced figure of £662,379.
Here are some items now and 10 years ago :

In 10 years the co. has thus (1) paid its regular dividend ;
(2) paid for all additions to properties, piant, etc. ; (3)
added about £74,000 to its stock; and (4) added
£227,770 to its liquid assets (mostly deposits and Govern-
ment securities). As a former S. Aus. M.L.O. once said
in the House, “That lily don’t want no paint.” Nor
will it surprise most people—particularly those who read
this column—to find that “it is the intention of the
Board to increase the capital of the co. at an early date,”
though the directors have not yet decided how or how
much. Eighteen months ago The Bulletin said it was
coming, and believed it Was coming then. Apparently
the directors waited to see how the cat jumped ; and for
information on that point consult Mr. Judkins. But
the time liiay come when the anti-pub campaign will be
in the hands of men who will know how to put up a less
blundering fight. “The trade” may even then go on
winning; but it will only be at a big and constant
expenditure.

For many years the list of this co.’s profits looked as
though the lawn-mower had been run over it. Then it
got ouc of its smooth-cropped appearance, and in 1906
sprang up over £2OOO without a word of warning. Some
people even suspected at the time that the co. might be
threatening to pay more than the 4 per cent, which
has been forthcoming since 1898 (before that for a
while it was 5 per cent.). But the effort was too
much, and the co. has got back to the old £13,000 or
thereabouts. If there is as much froth on the co.’s beer
as there is on its accounts, it would take a good blow to
shift it. As shown above, it has reserves nominally of
£50,469. According to the share market, it hasn’t got
any reserves at all, and, moreover, more than half of its
capital is bubble. The share market isn’t, however, the
most infallible guide in the world ; and it may take either
too gloomy or too sanguine a view of the facts. Practi-
cally the published accounts are no guide at all; for it is
certain that the co. would be showing a much bigger
profit if £1 on the balance-sheet meant 20s. Yet if it
doesn’t mean 205., there is no reason why it should mean
one thing more than another. A few grains may perhaps
be gleaned from a comparison of the items :
1901. 1909. 1910.

Expenses(including provision
for bad debts) .. .. 48,623 36,389 36,410
From the first table it will be seen that £29,250 has been
written off in the past 10 years—mostly from freeholds.
In addition to that, bad debts have been charged direct
to profit and loss; and the fact that sundry debtors have
been reduced from £77,348 to £39,667 suggests that a
good deal of dead-horse has probably been cleared out
there as well. Also, about £9OOO has been added to the
nominal reserves. All this ought to mean that the co. is
between £30,000 and £40,000 better off than it was 10
years ago—that or more. But other bad debts may have
happened meantime, or other bad bargains may have
been made, or there may be fiercer competition. One
thing is certain : the co.’s beer can’t be as cloudy as its
balance-sheet. If it were, the co. would have to go off
the market. Which shows how much more particular
we are about our beer than our balance-sheets.

This is the prosperous concern in which there has been a
civil war. The casus belli was a block of ground next
door. The co. used to hold it, but was advised to throw 1
it up, as it wouldn’t be wanted for years, and, anyhow, as
it couldn’t be any good to anybody else, the co. could be
sure of getting it when it was wanted. Lately, the co.
was strongly recommended to buy it, but the price
asked was a bit of a staggerer. Then it transpired that
between times this block of ground had changed hands,
and that some of the people who ruled the East Greta
rocked the other cradle also. There was a row,- of
course, and various changes in the management (including
the directorate) were agreed to; and as this week’s
Bulletin is being churned out in the printing-room, some
warm remarks are probably being made at the meeting
at Newcastle. If the office were shifted from Newcastle
it might be an improvement. The atmosphere there seems
bad. Very luckily for those who want as little disturb-
ance as possible the past half-year has been remarkably
prosperous, and the biggest output and the biggest pro-
fit on record are shown. There was, in fact, an idea of
paying a 20 per cent, dividend (10 per cent, dividend and
10 per cent, bonus) ; but 15 per cent, was finally agreed
on. Nothing like a fat dividend as an anaesthetic! The
co. owns two of the best mines on the Maitland coalfield
—the Stanford Merthyr and the East Greta —and the
East Greta railway. The visible reserves are not very
large; but the co. has been stuffing away profits for
years and making its position very sound. “ Mining and
house properties, railways and sidings ” are nowadays
lumped in the balance-sheet; at present they
stand at £87,218. This paper doesn’t know what
the two mines have been written down to out
of profits ; but five years ago the East Greta free-
hold was down to £12,613 and the Stanford Merthyr
leasehold to £11,000; and the chances are that the book-
value of the mines is now nominal. That means that the
whole of the capital and the visible reserves are repre-
sented by a very profitable railway, mining and railway
plant and liquid assets without reckoning in the mines
themselves at all. The liquid assets are more than
sufficient to pay off a debenture debt of £28,000 and all
other liabilities. Besides the amounts shown in the table
as written off, large sums have been charged direct to
profit and loss to cover depreciation—£3647 for the past
term. The position is, as remarked before, unusually
sound. The one insect in the co.’s eye is the unsubstan-
tial structure of the Northern coal vend ; and if that falls
to pieces, there may be a renewal of the cut-throat busi-
ness amoug the Northern producers.

The news that Adelaide was buying patches of
ground in the desert outside Southern Cross, and without,
any other security than four pegs stuck in the ground,
has caused more excitement in the West than has been
known since the days of the Londonderry. It was the
easiest snap the sharks have had for years. All they had
to do, it seemed, was to take train 200 miles, hire a
buggy, stick in four posts, and tell Adelaide that it could
have the “ mine ” for £lO,OOO. No wilder rush has been
recorded. In some cases men were too tired or eager
even to drive out, but stuck pegs in already pegged
ground. Thus much of the country near the Bullfinch
and the Corinthian has been pegged many’ times over oh
the off chance of catching the eye of the adjudicator first.
The magnet has nominally been the Westralian Bullfinch ;
the real attraction has been the Adelaide and Melbourne
pigeon.
The Bullfinch itself is a gorgeous surface show.
To the extent opened on it is wonderfully rich, and
the owners look like becoming some of the envied
of the earth. The bullbird, however, has a fairly
large homestead, Doolette and party having pegged
150 to 160 acres to take in as much of the lode as
they know of ; so those outside the parent nest have to
look on from afar. Again, there is no shadow of doubt
that the wonderful enrichment of the Bullfinch section,
as distinct fiqm others on the line of lode, is due to the
faulting of the ground. Outside the Bullfinch there is a
stretch of most ordinary-looking desert Country on which
nothing has been done, and on which nothing willbe done
for a month or so. The Warden arrives on the scene this
week, and as the pegs in places are stuck around like
nursery plantations, and no surveyor has seen the
ground y’et, he will have a tough job if he pro-
ceeds to decide many’ claims before the ground has been
mapped out. Compromises to facilitate matters have
been arranged in many instances; but a multitude of
claims remain, and no one will do any work in the cir-
cumstances. What is more, most of them are only too
glad, of the excuse for idleness. Until some sinking is
done outside the Bullfinch ranch, one might as well
gamble on flies crawling up a window as d£al in the
bird-lime scrip that is spread around.
Summing up all the evidence one can see and
gather, the Bullfinch is a rich pocket against a granite
intrusion, on a line of lode which is here and there in
other places possibly enriched by like influences. Hope’s
Hill, on the same line of country, stands, out. as a bulk
sample ; 125,000 tons from this claim Went sdwt. Going

Every engineer in charge of factories and mills
should give close attention to the power wasted in trans-
mission of power. The Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings
save 20 per cent, power and 75 per cent, of oil, so one of
the first duties is naturally for engineers to direct their
special attention to these bearings and to car boxes for
trucks. Hyatts are in continuous use in Cement Works,
Ore Dressing Mills, Factories, etc., in Australia. Bush-
ings of flexible rollers may be applied to loose pulleys or

Professor Richards, in the revised edition of liis
celebrated edition of “Ore Dressing” 1909, devotes 14
pages to the Wilfley concentrating table, and, among
other things remarks (p. 1465): —“The first table sold
was installed in the Puzzle Mill, at Breckenridge,
Colorado. Since then over 12,000 have been sold. This
machine has revolutionised ore dressing, and as such is a
phenomenal success. Tfre original fornvand forerunner
of all modern shaking tables .with longitudinal riffles.. has
been greatly improved. And further on (p. 1478) remarks:
“One feature of the Wilfley table to which especial
attention should be called is its ability to separate sands
from slimes while making the ordinary concentration.
This separatiop is more complete and thorough than can
be made by any classifier, and should be taken advantage
of in designing mills.” In the extensive additions just
made to the Golden Horseshoe Mine (W.A.) a large
number of Wilfley Concentrators have been installed.

along the line, and 12 miles out of the Gross, is the
Corinthian, a rich surface show. A fair amount of work
has been done at a shallow level hereabouts, but no one
hints that the rich stuff is likelv to go down. About a
dozen miles further on is the Bullfinch. En route are
some claims which were worked by prospectors for some
weeks before the rush occurred. There have been some
crushings from these, but rarely of outstanding merit.
Thirty-ton parcels picked from narrow or erratic
uodes need to go a couple of ounces to give something
■over tucker.
A feature of the clamor round the Bullfinch is
the argument as to which way the lode runs. The main
lode runs west of north, but’ the secondary enrichment
■seems to have .come from east and west veins, so one
finds the Finch .tribe decorating ail points of the com-
pass. But, be it noted, all are outside the boss bird’s
ranch of 160 acres. Specimens are produced as having
come from this, that or the other point of the horizon ;
but when one looks at the place whence a specimen is
alleged to have come, and sees a good subject for a wheat
field or a cabbage patch, doubts of the story are felt, if
not expressed.
Pegging for prospecting purposes (otherwise
flotations) has been proceeded with on a large scale by
several of those who got in early in the Bullfinch rush.
Morris Doolette and Shallcross have pegged 11 24-acre
leases around a spot where they found a £dwt. specimen.
Another new find was followed by the pegging of 200
acres, and so the game goes on.
Doolette, who served some time on the
•Great Boulder milling plant, is to take a hand himself in
(treating the ore from the Bullfinch, a lease fra term
■having been taken of the local treatment works. He
ireckons tfe<e difficulties in getting out the gold can easily
be overcome, and thinks the extraction should be hustled
along .on present lines.
* * # *
From Alex, Montgomery, the Westralian State
Mining Engineer: “ The Bullfinch leases occur on a low
rise protruding from loam-covered flatsof lacustrineorigin.
To the S.W. of the principal workings the hill shows
(much banded jasperoid rock and quartz. The Bullfinch
lodes show less laminated quartzite and more solid quartz
r.han the Corinthian lodes. The Bullfinch veins seem tq
■run about N. 75deg. W., in several roughly parallel lines,
but both north and south the formation tends to take
(the usual N.N.W. trend of the Yilgarn auriferous zone.
Probably the nearly east and west strike of the veins is
■due to a local twisting of the more ancient sheared zone,
■with the consequent formation of vents for thermal
activity, resulting in the formation of the ore bodies.
There are plainly separate bodies of gold-bearing material.
The vein now being developed (No. 1 shaft) is clearly only
part of a large formation. On the surface, the numerous
-ore-oceurrenees opened by costeens also show that the
■golden zone is very wide, with numerous lenses, bunches
and veins through it, rather than one continuous body."
* * « *
The miner, when he gets a new field to work
upon, is a whale at nomenclature. For instance, at the
new Bullfinch goldfield (Westralia) the claims include the
Bullfinch, Bullfinch No. 2 South., Bullfinch No. 2 North,
Bullfineh No. 4 North, Bullfinch North, Bullfinch No. 3,
Bullfinch Deeps, Bullfinch Consols, Bullfinch Junction,
Bullfinch Main iLode, South Bullfinch and Bullfinch South
Extended. Then by way of side issues are the Goldfinch,
Chaffinch, Great Finch, Green Finch and the Blackbird
and Bell Bird, which last, as the field develops and
new claims are taken up, will naturally lead to the
Church Bell, Dihner Bell, Curfew Bell, Dead Bird, Old
Hen, Cock-o'-the-Walk, Shanghai Rooster and Bad Egg.
Another branch or side issue is a claim called the Bull
Ant, which will probably he followed by the Bull Dog,
Tripe Hound and Corned Beef in natural sequence. The
Butterfly mine flocks by itself. It is difficult to trace its
connection with the original Bullfinch, and unless it
leads to the establishment of the Great Cockroach Ex-
tended it appears to be a cul-de-sac.

Melbourne joined in the Bullfinch boom about
as briskly as a man forks out a crown to a dead-beat. The
same old string of roadsters appeared in this Marathon
trot after wealth. Mt. Maroomba Gordon offered the
Bullfinch Main Lode Syndicate. Early Bird Shep-
pard and the Maroomba-Venture Wards fluttered
into the light with the Great Finch. Fiedler
had his own little fledgling, and P. P. Cook
took the Bullpup into his kennel. Captain Thomas had
his own nestling, and “Sandy” Oliver, Marriott and a
few more engineered floats. But there was not
that cheerful bidding for scrip that the professional
floater yearns for, so the Adelaide message, “The public
are on the feed very well, thank you,” didn’t find an echo
in Melbourne. Fact was Rutter Clarke hit the boom on
the jaw in the first round, and the investor, taking this
and other warnings seriously, is waiting for work to prove
what is granite, what is diorite, and what is gold-bearing
quartz.

The annual report of the Hainault (W.A.)
shows the same reserves as last year—loo,ooo tons—but
worth a shilling per ton less (285.). The costs are put
down at 17s. s'lBd. per ton. A feature of the accounts is
the way London gets on to some of the smalt margin left
after paying working exes. Directors take £9OO and the
office £553. The British Government swallowed £424 for
income tax, while the W.A. dividend tax only amounted
to £lB7, which seems horribly disproportionate, seeing
that W.A. supplied all the gold. Shareholders were
doled out a sixpenny dividend, which is more than the
mine could really afford, and better developments are
anxiously awaited.
* * * *
Rich values are at last being definitely reported
from the 1650 ft. level of the lialgurli (W.A.); rumors of
such things have been whispered for the last three
months. Off the west crosscut, where the bore went in
some time ago, the values prove to be 15dwt. along the
first 31ft. north, and 20dwt. for the first 25ft. going
south. Some rich telluride is being got from these levels,
and developments should maintain some of the past
reputation of Golden Mile mines.
* * * «
Beyond a few questions by a shareholder whose
chief grievance seemed to be that, with another manager,
a different story might have been told, the Golden Pole
meeting, on the Westralian goldfields, was passed in
funeral-like gloom. The chairman confessed that the
mine was at the end of its tether, and would be let to
tribucors. The gloom was so thick that no one even sug-
gested what should be done with the funds remaining, so
the directors have a free hand.
* * * *
The dozen or so people who are left at Bulong,
the Westralian centre kept alive for a long while by
Harvey Patterson’s Queen Margaret, are not getting ex-
cited about the new deep lead at the Oversight, over
which the Mines Department recently emitted a prema-
ture whoop. A 2oz. yield is expected from the first
crushing ; but the chief trouble is that not enough dirt is
in sight to provide a second, or, at any rate, a third trip
to the mill.
Gwalia South meeting, held in Kalgoorlie last
week, was merely a formal affair, shareholders being
satisfied with the shilling dividend, and the news that
the option on the remaining reserved shares let to a
London firm of brokers and carrying control of the
market had not so far been exercised. Confidence was
expressed that the borehole assays westward would be
confirmed, and that the report of the German geologist
would lift the market.
* * * *
Broken Hill Junction left the dividend list 13
years ago and doesn’t look like crawling back yet awhile.
Last six months it has been mostly “ developing ’’—which
is the polite way of saying that it has been looking for
another bunch of ore. The finances are in a very .bad
wav : on July 31 theco. owed £15,650, and had only £1475
of cash and ‘book debts. The advances have been made
on the strength of the uncalled capital; but it is a weary
business working off a dead horse. And, besides that, a
pretty big expenditure on new works is inevitable.
**■*■*'
Shaft-sinking continues at the Bookham, near
Yass (N.S. W.), which has a heavily-mineralised porphyry
formation, with a reef continually changing in size and
value. For this latter reason shares are a good gambling
counter, with just a sporting chance that the reef will
prove payable. One parcel of 13 tons sent to Cockle Creek
from the sinking to 65ft. averaged slightly over 2oz.
Since then a rich make of sulphide ore at 70ft. put life
into the market; but the rich assays soon gave way to a
pinched reef and much lower values. The disturbance is
technically known as a roll in the reef, and has happened
once before in the course of sinking. The ore may quite
possibly live down: the Yerranderie silver mines, near
Camden, are also in porphyry, and have proved persistent
and payable veins to a depth of 500 ft.
* * * *
The Bodangora, which is to have a go at the
old Dick’s Reward mine (N.S.W.), will proceed to allot-
ment this week. Dick, the leather man, ran this mine
and its better-known neighbor, the Mitchell’s Creek.
The latter had the most work done in it; and when it
ran poor, and costs ran high, the Dick’s section carried
it for some time on its back. When the Glasgow leather-
man died chaos reigned for awhile in connection with his
affairs, and Costs had an innings; and the mines were
left to look after themselves. Eventually they were sold
by the estate; and the buyers called in Savage and Ash-
croft, and afterwards T. W. Horton. These engineers
reckon that there is a profit of £5OOO in the stone actually
blocked out—this is above the 500 ft. level —and there is
also stone underfoot; in fact, the Mitchell’s ,Cjreek was
worked down to 1200 ft. The vendors take 12,500 shares
and £3500, and 12,500 shares go to the ppblie ; and
another £3500 is expected to be all that w.i|ll pe peeded to
put the co. on its feet. There is a 20-stamp battery, wit|h
tables, etc., on the property ; this is really whgt the co.
is paying the vendors the £3500 cash for. It is p modest
little venture with very fair prospects, and there won’t b,e
any long, weary waiting for results.
* * * *
Whatever the looker-on may think, those in the
thick of the Tolwong(N.S.W-) certainly have unbounded
faith in the concern. The truth, whatever it is, should
soon be out now. “The middle of next month should
see us in full swing,” says the general manager. “Con-
sidering all things, I think it will be a great achieve-
ment.” The Bulletin hopes so. But let the figures talk.
* * * *
Some excitement has been caused at Wyalong
(N.S. W.) owing to the discovery of gold-stone on a special
lease used as a brickyard. The owners have put in an
objection to the working of the find by the applicants
(Nelson and party), and the matter will go before the
Warden.

Australia is coming on— it produced 10,055 tons
of pig iron for the September quarter. Now, encouraged
by a moderate Commonwealth bounty and a State con-
tract, the Hoskins people are laying down a more exten-
sive plant at Lithgow, including coke ovens, steel fur-
naces and a rolling mill.
* * * *
Mount Elliott, Cloncurry (Q.), is supporting
Corbould’s estimate. He said he could laydown blister
copper f.o.b. Townsville for £3O per ton. He seems to
be doing it for little over £2B. In September the co, pro-
duced 525 tons blister, worth 99‘3 per cent, copper,
and containing (say) £7 worth of gold and silver per ton.
(This gold and silver value is an estimate based on the re-
sults got during the previous smelting campaign.) The
625 tons at £2B would cost £14,700. Add £8 for freight,
refining and marketing=£42oo; total, £18,900. Say 521
tons copper at £58=£30,218. Add £7 for gold and silver
= £3647. Total value, £33,865. Deduct costs, £18,900 ;
and we get £14,965 profit for the month.
* * * *
Hampden, Cloncurry (Q.), is getting its machi-
nery forward for the smelter and converter plant, and
has the advantage of a railway at the door instead of
facing 60 to 70 miles of road carting, like Mt. Elliott had
to contend with ; so the cost of erection should be greatly
reduced, as well as the time taken over the job, A
suction gas plant is to be installed for power, which is
expected to overcome the water trouble that Elliott has
to face. That trouble will always be a skeleton in
the cupboard in this waterless belt. Hampden has
a large supply of mineral water in the mine, but
chemicals have to be used to make it fit for boiler pur-
poses, and this method is by no means satisfactory. Still
it is better than the position at Elliott. That mine holds
little water, and the supply for both boiler and domestic
purposes is pumped from the uncertain sandbeds in a
creek. So far, there has been no trouble in getting suffi-
cient water, and, with the aid of large galvanized-iron
cooling tanks to break down the steam from the various
boilers, they manage to get along; but, with the hot
season, troubles are liable to start. If suction gas is a
success at Hampden, it will prove a godsend to the dry
region. #
Mt. Cuthbert (Q.) is doing solid development
work at 350 ft., with north and south drives running along
the eastern and western walls of a wide ore channel. This
means duplicate drives ; but it is healthy to find the show
raising a big heap of ore which should bulk 8 per cent,
copper. The south drive along the eastern wall at the
350 ft. level is in 188 ft. with a full face of 12£ per cent,
ore. The previous sampling gave 10 per cent. The mine
would sparkle if it were handier to market.
* * * *
Great Fitzroy (Q.) is picking its ore to tide it
over its immediate troubles. Winzing at the northern
end of No. 3 level has been stopped, in order that by
crosscutting at 400 ft. the ground overhead may get a
chance to drain. The last22ft. in the winze—which went
down very flat —gave an average of 3'6 per cent, copper
and3’3dwt. gold, and no doubt crosscutting will disclose a
fine width of ore. It is this great width of the Fitzroy
body which enables the management to quote 654,833
tons of ore, averaging slightly under 3 per cent, copper
and 2Jdwt. gold, above No. 3 level. Whether it can be
made to pay is purely a question of low costs and good
extraction.
* * * *'
Many Peaks, fathered by Mount Morgan,
promises to be a good son. A month’s returns show r that
2916 tons of the flux gave 330 z. fine gold (£140), and 66
tons copper (£3300). Copper contents were about 2’3
per cent. In addition to the Mount Morgan demands,
551 tons went south to Port Kembla. An adjacent lease,
owned by the Queensland Copper Co., has so far not over-
whelmed its owners w’ith big results. The South lease,
where drives were put in up to 320 ft., seems only favored
w-ith dolerite and diabase, and has been shelved in favor
of the North lease, where a few men are chasing results.
Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers, declares
a sixpenny (£6250). Interest is being: taken in the
deepest level about 2850 ft. from surface; but, so far,
development has proved rather disappointing;. No. 19
continues to make westerly on a strong body of payable
stone beyond the 240 ft. mark.
* * * *
Newlßrilliant Freehold, Charters Towers, paid
its sixth shilling a few days since, making a total of
£45,000. The mine looks like producing £120,000 this
year, and dividends will not be much under half that
amount. In spite of all the development work, reserves
are suspected of declining in value. A payable make
in No. 4 level would help to put things right, arid the
opening of the level will be anxiously watched. No. 3
east level at 148 ft. from the crosscut has a vein of good
stone in the face ; but it remains to be seen if it will make
into anything substantial. A big lease can be prospected
for 20 years without disclosing anything of much value,
and yet at a greater depth or away in some corner there
may be a streak of gold. The Freehold and Mexican were
both rewarded for their perseverance, and, helped by
neighbors, they eventually got into the right corner.
The Brilliant, whose hopes lay in the direction of the
Brilliant Block boundar\ r , may repeat this bit of history.

Stannary (Q.) has held its meeting in Adelaide.
Chairman Darling expressed his confidence in the future,
but hinted that, with so much development to be done, a
call would probably have to be made. Still, there was
recently £3399 in the till, and Manager Stockdale knows
his business and doesn’t splash money, so there is a
chance of a market move when the mill starts again. All
idea of shifting the plant has been wisely dropped ;
Stockdale thinks that pumping water to a new site would
be nearly as big a nuisance as trucking ore for seven
miles.

Ohillagoe (Q.) smelting returns show that 6855
tons from Etheridge mines contained 67850 z. gold,
49,6720 z. silver, and 57 tons copper ; so the average value
was from £4 to £5 per ton. But these shipments give no
idea of the value of crudes; they represent mill residues
and concentrated material. The big co. builds a lot on
the just-tapped field ; but it is a risky business, for
Etheridge has only a very moderate tonnage proved so far.

“ Ashpan ”: Re somebody having a pull in
connection with the limitation of Powlett coal supplied
to the Vic. railways (B. 20/10/T0). Dunno. Personally,
as one who uses the coal, I hope whoever is pulling will
haul hard enough to still further reduce the use of Pow-
lett coal on locomotives. It must be well known to the
officers of the Department that the coal is not nearly
equal to Newcastle. The number of circulars sent to
drivers to “ Please explain ” the excessive use of coal, and
the number of times “ Dirty slack Powlett.” has been
returned as the explanation ought to cohVjince them.
There ipust be enough of these circulars pigeon-holed at
the Spencey-street offices to proyide fuel 1 foy Tait’s loco-
motives for a day or two. The average loqpmotive fire-
box, with an average load, gets choked with ashes in 20
or 30 m,iies with Powlett coal. With good Newcastle coal
this does not occur under 100 miles. Also, it takes about
101 b. per mile more of Powlett than Newcastle to do the
same work. Jit may hot be good policy to admit these
things while private interests control Newcastle ; but to
blurt out the truth may help the people to see the neces-
sity of Federal control of the coal mines. Why should
we continue to use coal that is about 1,000,000 years too
young simply to stay the greed of the Newcastle monopo-
lists ? There is a simpler way than that.
* * * *
If, as a well-informed correspondent alleges,
Powlett coal is not well-suited to railway use, all the
more reason why the House of Fat Landlords should
allow its sale for domestic use.
Johnson’s Reef, Bendigo, cries 4230 z from 171-
tons. For an oldster with a shaft down over 3000 ft. this
is a turn in the right direction. The old claim's manager
came back to where the Collman shoot makes beyond the
big fault on the Collman and Tacchi boundary,
allured by the gold being got to the south by Collman’s.
Old-uns were sceptical, but a 2£oz. yield not only wipes
out bank overdrafts but lifts a cloud of scepticism.
Nearly all the gold was got about the cap, but it was only
when the formation began to get more solid that the pos-
sibility of something good was accepted. Now the gold
has been got not only in the turnover of the cap,
but in the east leg as well. Work here so far has
not got far ahead of the stopes, so they can’t t,ell the ex-
tent of the shoot, but the quartz broken out on the
eastern side is so high-grade that Jjendigopians enthuse
more over the developments than is their wont. The co.
has a good extent of ground here, and if the stone keeps
up at all to the standard Johnson’s will have a good run,
besides helping other shows.

Briseis closed its accounts for 1909 on Dec. 31,
and publishes the figures 10 months later! This is slower
even than the fat Bank of Australasia. If the Briseis
were a hard-up citizen of the Never-Never, the delay
would be excusable ; but its own showing is that it has
cash assets £51,490, and reserves £49,280. So it
could afford to cable its few London totals,
add them to the working account totals, and let
shareholders on both sides of the world know the
results of the year’s business within three months after
the term closes. There is too much dependence on the
consulting engineers and too little push ever to hope for
better things. On the above figures Briseis has improved
its cash position. As at the end of 1908, cash assets were
£37,483, and reserves £30,030. But then £60,000 in divs.
were shelled out during 1908, whereas the crumbs for
1909 were few andtfar between. Some figures of the work
done won’t hurt by publication
1908. 1909.
Overburden sluiced, cub. yds. .. 576,000 438,700
Drift sluiced, cub. yds. .. .. 539,300 325,000
Output black tin, tons .. .. 1,048 966 J
These totals are those of the Briseis mine alone. The
Brothers No. 1 in 1908 turned out 346 tons of black tin,
and in 1909 136 J tons, of which the Briseis took 58 per
cent, under its working agreement. This source of
revenue is gone, as the No. 1 is a past number, and the
Briseis mine proper also, only 500 tons of black tin
remaining to be scooped out of the northern
end. At 50 tons a month this is work for 10
months. Before then the Krushka flat is to be
opened up, and another 1,000,000 yards of drift
brought to do tribute to human gold-hunger. In all,
1200 tons of black tin are estimated as available here, so
that about three years of apparently profitable work is in
sight. Then the Ringarooma lease drifts will be tackled.
As the lead pitches into that block under the river there
ought to be as good values there as on the Briseis
side of the stream. Currie won’t publish a pre-
diction as to what is going to happen when he
gets the water on to the wash at the Ringarooma, but
he wasn’t wearing crape over things when he left Mel-
bourne. Dredging at Wallace’s sections confirms the
belief that young Wallace got the better bargain when
Currie elected to buy him out. Lindesay Clark says
accounts will straighten when he gets his big dredges
going; but the Sludge Board, or some other public
nuisance, may snatch profits just when things look nicest.

The slump in silver-lead mining on the West
Coast (Tas.) continues, owing chiefly to the Smelting Co.
being still closed dowm. A Parliamentary Committee is
inquiring into the causes and looking for a solution. It
will probably be found that the trouble is that the Her-
cules and other cos. with large bodies of zinc-sulphide
ores are unwilling to sell at the small profit shown with
present methods of treatment, and are hanging off for
the result of the Tasmanian Metals Extraction Co.’s ex-
periment at Rosebery. Even so, things might go along
more smoothly if smelter-manager Harris and Senator
Clemons (chairman of the Hercules and Tas. Copper cos.)
had a better opinion of one another.

Port Moresby has again got itself excited over
the usual discovery of a great copper show, 18 miles out. It
was so great that Papua sent the news by steamer to
Thursday Island, and had it wired from there. And the
fool dailies print this sort of thing“ As soon as the
mine has been developed sufficiently to justify the forma-
tion of a large company, Messrs. Henry E. Hurst, Cluny,
and McPherson will proceed to London for the purpose.
Mr. Hurst is now en route to Melbourne and Adelaide.
He will return to Port Moresby before proceeding' to Lon-
don.” Writer has seen copper shows 18 miles out of
Moresby—surface shows of carbonate ore, and not much
of it, and no sulphides. One show was made up of water-
carried boulders of carbonate ores, and / as soon as
these were dug up out of an old creek bed the "mine
was blown out. Messrs. Hurst and Oluny and McPherson
are hereby advised to wait until the mine has been de-
veloped very sufficiently, London is a cold place for
copper mines which have no ore reserves,

LAY AWAKE IN PAIN AND MISERY.
Mrs. Angus, of Oxide arid Wolfram Streets,
Broken Hill, says : “For four years my life was
a misery, I suffered so with indigestion. I would
go to bed only to lie awake in pain and misery,
until I was nearly mad. I tried everything, but
could get no rest or relief. Then my sister-in-law,
Mrs. Brown, of Warrnambool, Vic., told me of
the great benefit one of her neighbors had received
from Chamberlain’s Tablets, and induced me to
try them. The first few doses brought relief and
rest. After I had finished two boxes new life
seemed to be given me. I have had no return of
my complaint; and now go about my daily duties
in a cheerful manner.”*

“Geofred”: Down the N.S.W. South
Coast, just after passing Yallah, I last week
noticed clumps of pricldy pear all along the side
of the embankment, and in places it extended in-
land (always in small clumps) for a good distance.
Inquiry elicited the fact that no efforts are being
made to check the plant. Years ago in Banana-
land, when King Jimmie (not “Pannikin”) wore
little except a radiant smile, the pear had exactly
the same beginning. Had it been tackled ear-
nestly at that stage of its babyhood, Kidder would
have had more land and less pear to offer settlers
than he has to-day. I don’t know whose job it is
to wrestle with the South Coast’s vegetable
spines; but, if it isn’t anybody’s to-day, it ought
to be made somebody’s before next pay-day
happens around.
ON THEIR TRACK.
GENTLEMAN BURGLAR (to friend): “Look 'ere,
Bill! It's no use knocking about like that.
Pinch some togs an’ look a gent, so the
cops won’t guess yer profession."
“ Sea Gee He the behavior of the angora
when he goes to the barber. I have seen a small
flock of the goats shorn in the S.E. of S. Aus.—-40
odd, clipped by one man. They were shorn in the
shearing-shed, in ordinary sheep-pens, and were
quiet enough on the board. There was a fair
amount of bleating, certainly ; but not more than
one hears at a political meeting. The smell was
the loudest part of the show. The shearer com-
plained principally of the lice which inhabited the
beasts.
“Pick : I witnessed an interesting de-
monstration the other day to prove that white
ants will not attack timber that has first been
soaked in salt water. Throe blocks of spotted
gum were rooted out of an anthill where they
had been embedded 18 months previously by an
old bush theorist. _ Before burial one block had
been submerged in salt water for a fortnight;
another, cut from the same tree, had been coated
with wood-preserving oil, and the third had
received no treatment. The experiment proved
the splitter’s contention that salt water check-
mates the termite, for not only was the first-
mentioned block the only one of the three not
riddled with ant-holes, but the ants had encased
it with clay, apparently to get the unsavory thing
out of their sight. In a district like the N.S.W.
South Coast, where, in spite of ant-aprons and
wood-preserving oils galore, the termites eat
houses almost as fast as carpenters build them,
this old bushman’s discovery should be worth its
weight in beer and sandwiches.
THE EPIDEMIC.
JANE: “ Got the influenzer, has he, pore thing ? Well, jist you make up a mixture of treacle,
lemmings and Jamaiker rum, and give him a hegg-cup every hour, rub his chest with
whisky, put a cold whisky compress round his neck, and put his feet in a bath of hot
beer and mustard.”
JEHU : “ Lor' love yer, missus! If I had all them luxuries what would I want drivin' a cab.”
“The Snake” deposits the final Weird
Noise :
I was out “ doing' ” a murder in the bush for a Maori-
land paper when I heard the Weird Noise. The dead man
had been one of a party clearing timber on contract, and
the camp was composed of three tents away in a lonely
part of a range of black, sullen hills. With a couple of
the party I left 13, a small township about 10 miles from
“the scene,” per horseback late one afternoon. Most of
us had a drop or two—not to say a pint or two—of bush
pub whisky inside our skins, and a bottle or two
inside our overcoats. It was dark when we
reached the camp, and it was raining; and the
misery of a wet night in the Maoriland bush will only be
surpassed if there is a snowstorm when the dead rise in
their shrouds on the Jay of Dudgment. We sat round a
mournful tea, each man thinking of that which they had
found on the hillside with its twisted face staring dread-
fully at the blood pool wherein lay its hand. Till nearly
midnight we sat listening to the drip, drip of the
rain, starting uneasily even if a man accidentally struck
his pannikin against the mouth of the whisky bottle.
Then somebody said, “D n it, let’s go to bed.” There
was only one place for me to sleep. That was in the
dead man’s tent, which was ‘ZO yards from the
others. 1 didn’t want to go there, and I knew
that none of the others would have gone there to save
their souls ; but they watched me—watched me furtively
as every coward watches for the sign of the other coward.
And so I went; and when I saw the lights go out in the
other tents, I felt that I had been put away in the black
places of Eternity. I must have dozed, for suddenly I
found myself standing clear from the bunk straining my
ear-nerves till they rang in my head. Then I heard it
again! A long, low wail that seemed to drag
itself from place to place like a Lost Horror.
Then silence, and the drip of fihe rain, and
the straining nerves, and the picture of that
which had lain with its mouth twisted to the blood
stream. Twice more I heard the cry before I fled to
where human beings were, and there I found them as
panic-stricken as myself. For that sound had lifted them
from their broken sleep and brought them to a huddled
group. Till the good day broke we spoke in whispers,
and poured the liquor slantingly into the pannikins that
it might make the less noise. When the grey light came,
we lit a fire and put the billy on. Ten minutes later we
were drinking hot tea, when suddenly the moaning cry
lifted again. By ,” said one, “ I’ll find out what that
is.” He took a rifle from his bunk, and we followed him
into the bush. It was a quarter of an hour before we
heard the sound again, but at last it came up from a
gully beneath us. Carefully we clambered down, and not
a man of us but expected another tragedy. We worked
up a creek, and under a heavy growth of fern and scrub
lay the cause of the night of terror—a small calf on its
side, held to the ground by a tangle of fencing-wire on
its neck. Some years have passed since then, and more
will go over my head ; but till the End comes and sorrow
and sweet hours are done with I shall carry the recollec-
tion of the most weird sound that I ever heard.
“S.E.S.”: A submissive mortal is the
poor old lubra. Murri instils a regard for honor
and obedience into her with a club; sometimes he
knocks her down and jumps on her, taking a run
and a spring to give it force. She is the beast of
burden; her master hunts, fights and corroborees.
Sometimes a gin gets tired of her lord and runs
away with another man, but if her original pro-
prietor catches her only the hand of Providence
will save her from his vengeance. A familiar
figure for many years on Tomki station, Rich-
mond River (N.S.W.), was an old gin, minus feet,
who used to move about on her hands and knees.
She had bolted with another blackfellow, but
was tracked and brought back by the wronged
husband. “My word !” he said, as he knocked
her down at the camp by way of a welcome home,
“ I make you can’t run away.” Then he chopped
off both her feet with a tomahawk.
“Beaten”: Was sitting alongside the
shanty the other day when I saw a hen eg?; lying
in the yard, and thought I’d collect it before the
sun cooked it. At that instant I spotted three
gohannas evidently thinking the same thing, so
I waited developments. After a consultation the
smallest go’ turned on his back, and his mates
very carefully rolled the egg on to his bunker.
Then they harnessed themselves to his tail and
started for the scrub. The upside-down fellow,
however, appeared to find the weight on top of
his boiler too heavy, for he promptly but care-
fully pricked a hole in the egg with his claw and
sucked it dry. On reaching the scrub, the
gohannas who had provided the horse-power un-
hitched themselves and turned round to prepare
for lunch ; but in their hurry to unload it the
shell was broken and the horrifying truth almost
paralysed them. When I saw them last they
were pursuing the confidence man over the
horizon, throwing up clouds of dust and cursing
like demons.
“ Puketapu ” : Down in the little Scotch
settlement at the tail-end of Maoriland, where
thewhareof my father stood beside the Falls of
Whirling Snow, there lived an old Scottish farmer
whose main idiosyncrasy was that anything aslant
or off the perpendicular was highly disagreeable
to the Divine Eye. One day he pulled on his old
red nightcap—lie never wore any other kind of
head-cover—and said to me : “ Come awa’ wi’ me,
laddie, and see how they chaps are getting on wi’
the fence. Wait awee till I get ma plumb bob.”
Crossing the paddock, he told me that he
had made the men who were erecting the
fence pull down about five chains of it three times
running because it was not in a straight line with
the centre of Heaven, and the fear of the Lord
was upon him. When we reached the job the old
man shut one eye and looked along the fence.
Then he hung his plumb bob, and said to a man
who was ramming down a post: “Stand a wee
bit ta one side, Hubert, till 1 try ma plumb bob.”
Presently.he grew purple in the face, and in a
loud voice ordered the whole fence to be pulled
down again. Robert threw down his rammer with
an oath. “Pull it down yourself, you blinded
old haggis, and give me my cheque,” lie shouted.
“This is the twenty millionth time I’ve
rammed them posts, and I’ll'see you scorch before
I’ll ram them once more.” “ Aweel, Rubert,’’re-
plied the boss, “maybe it’s cheaper to pav you
than to bring the wrath o’ the Loard upon us all.”
So Robert was paid off, and that night as the old
man sat sipping his toddy he suddenly said to me,
“ They’re a wheen o’scallywags, hinny; I’ll do
the fence myself.” So he did, and one evening
when the bush birds were singing their good-night
song they found the old gentleman leaning'against
the last post, stone dead, with the plunib-bob in
his stiffened fingers.
“Geofred”: “Pick” (B. 13/10/10) dis-
credits rny pig-yarn wherein I claimed a life-
saving medal for a porker passenger per s.s.
Kameruka. My yarn was correct in all except
one detail. That was re Pete and Jack Davis.
These men certainly were on the beach, and their
method of floating a rope ashore on lifebuoys was
attempted ; but as the tide was receding and the
wind was blowing off the land, the rope never
reached the shore. Therefore, I beseech “Pick ”
to give his Majesty Nicholas the benefit of his
company.
“ Ben Telbow ” : Don’t care what you
say, Fraser is right. Australians are degenerating.
Was staying at Talcowie (S. A.), where they carry
on mixed farming, when a dance happened—
Nellie was 21. The guests came per motor, trap
and nag from 20 miles around. Such a miserable-
looking crowd —not more than half of them over
6ft.; and they danced in that degenerate, not to
say violent, way which foretells early extinction.
Few of them will ever see 95. Nellie, herself,
only 21, in the full bloom of early womanhood —
she’s degenerating fast. We sat out five dances
in the cowshed. At 3 a.m. I spoke of retiring.
“ Oh, wait for the second supper,” she said. At
four, when I finally slipped away, the music was
still going strong, though it ceased at five; and
the guests, after an early breakfast, streaked for
home and work. And Nellie, havingchanged her
dress, went out to milk the cows. . We played
tennis in the afternoon ; it was only 105° in
the shade. Yes, we’re dying out all right. What
with anaemic women and weakling men, there’s no
demand in these parts for race suicide.
“The Scoop”: The successful criminal-
catcher looked round the bar disconsolately ; the
place was full of importers and Freetraders, but
he couldn’t arrest one of them. “Watson, old
man,” he said, “I’m getting weary of this. There
was more fun in the old days when I was the
solitary policeman in a country town. Did lever
tell you the story of the Indian woman and the
remarkable Jay P.’s?” “No, Holmes,” I answered,
apologetically; “I think not.” The criminal-
catcher puffed reflectively at his milk and
raspberry soda. “It won’t take Jong, Watson,”
he said, after a long pause. “ I was sitting in my
study at the lock-up when an Indian woman
came in and informed me that she had some
hours previously been at the hotel hawking the
usual pack rubbish, and that a man who was
there had bought everything she had for sale.
This man, who was not sober, had given the silk
handkerchiefs and the other goods to the girls in
the house, paying the Indian woman with a
cneque, which, on presentation, was found to be
bogus. I immediately went to the hotel, fore-
seeing that if the man was not there he would
probably have gone somewhere else. He was not
there, which proved I was right. Saddling my
horse, I rode to the next pub, and there was my
bird asleep on the verandah. And now permit
me to introduce the remarkable Jay P.’s. Next
morning two of them listened gravely to the
charge of obtaining goods by false pretences. TJie
case was fully proved, and the Jays were just
considering whether they would give the prisoner
six months or hang him when they were joined by
a third Jay P., who entered into the consultation.
The new-comer no sooner looked at the dock than
he explained, ‘Hullo, how do you come to be
here?’ The prisoner was his station cook.
Watson, you can imagine my feelings when, two
minutes later, the prisoner was discharged. It
was the clerk who saved the position. Rising
from his chair, he whispered to the Bench that
the judgment was a reflection on the local con-
stable. ‘Very true, very true,’ said the chair-
man; ‘we overlooked that. Er—bring the
prisoner back again, constable;’ When I found
the cook he was in the local pub hosing himself
with the second pint. I dragged him back to the
dock, and he was solemnly sentenced to 24 hours’
imprisonment. ‘ And, constable,’said the Bench,
‘we highly commend your conduct.’ I give you
my word, Watson, I never flicked an eyelid.”

WHY? Well, we have undertaken a Sole Agency that calls for an enormous output, and we have
to live up to it, and so we are offering all Diamond goods at merely a commission on the actual cost.
It will pay us, because of the advertisement and the increase of customers.

“Ivan”: Wes-
tralians are the
greatest gamblers
in the Common-
wealth. I had an
experience with a
nap school one Sun-
day at Perth, under
a tree that shaded a
by-street. One of
the party placed a
sapling upright
against the fence,
and presently the
game was inter-
rupted by some-
one announcing the
approach of human
life. A man, woman
and two children,
with Biblesin hand,
were proceeding ap-
parently to church.
In an instant four
shillings were on
the grass, one chap
exclaiming, “ I’ll
take the old man
another, “I’m on
the boy”—and so,
on. As the party
slowly advanced,
the individual who
had secured the
sapling stood with
his eye to it as
serious as a judge
at the approach of
a Melbourne Cup
field. In a few
seconds they flash-
ed, or rather saun-
tered, past the post,
and the adjudica-
tor drawled, “ The
old woman wins.”
The “bobs” were
promptly handed
to the winner, and
nap was resumed,
pending the arrival
of the next family.
About 20 of these
events were got off
before church start-
ed, and still more after the service. In one race a
heavy father got a substantial lead and looked a
dead certainty until his bootlace came undone.
While he was tying it the family made up lee
way, and the dame waddled in a winner. I for-
get what the person who had his money on the
old man said, but I remember that it burned up
the pack of cards.
THE MALICE OF IT.
FIRST PROFESSIONAL BEER-EATER: “ Ain’t it wunnerful
the number o' blokes wot tells yer to yo an yet work.”
SECOND P.B.: “ Yes, an ’ most on ’em must know wot it’s
like, too—they looks as if they'd tried it on their selves.”

“ Clitypfin ’ : “Jimmie Pannikin (B.
G/10’10) is, like “Gil,” off the track regarding the
bugle-blowing of Outback coachdrivers. Neither
of these theorising bushmen understand the real
reason of the discordant blast. It is not from
babit, nor has it any romance about it. It is ali a
matter of expediency, lhe arrival of the mail is
an event in towns west of the Big Trickle, and
if “Flash Harry” were to sneak in unobserved,
. , , , , , ,■ -n , .t
the populace would be down on lnm. But the
important reason for the heralding is to allow the
solitary postal assistant time to finish his 50 up, or
give him the tip to wake up the P.M. in time to
receive the mail. I travelled once with a whip on
the Wilcannia-Whitecliffs road. He was a mem-
her of the town band, but still a musician above the
or( jinary, and once on the road, he’d hand over
the reins and give several selections on the cornet,
trombone, etc. He always carried a kettledrum
with him, in the hope of mee ting some one to
accompany him in “ Asleep on the Deep.”

“Midnight : I want to know how many
“Abo.” writers have seen white hawks ? I have
been all over N.S.W. and Victoria and in angles
0 f Queensland, and have seen only two—both in
the Clarence River district (N.S.W.). Anybody
else got the address of the albino hawk ?
THE HOMING BIRD.
OLDEST INHABITANT: “ I want a second-class
return ticket.”
PORTER : “ Where to?”
O.I. : “ Here, of course. Where else d'yeh think
I want to return to? ”
“ Spear” : Black brother’s horrible habit
of bartering his women and children is all due to
the blessings of civilisation. Before he felt the
elevating influence of the white man, his tribal
laws punished with awful severity any trans-
gression of the moral law. Among the Australian
desert tribes it is still a common practice to burn
a gin about the face and breasts if she commits an
indiscretion. In one instance the writer came
across a gin on the De Grey station (W. A.) whose
sinews had been completely burned through for a
suppo jd act of infidelity. The poor creature
had gone quite mad under this torture, which
proved later to have been entirely undeserved.
The woman, having found herself unable to reach
her husband’s camping ground, was obliged to
spend the night in a nearer one. The husband
had not allowed any explanation, but had used
the extreme measures mentioned, with the co-
operation and approval of the community. The
gins, themselves, show no mercy to an erring
sister, and reckon their men good pfellers for
holding the rein so tight.

“ Vigilans,” on the Northern Territory
sore :
Re sale of aboriginal children in the Northern Terri-
tory (B. 6/10/’10). “Larrakeyah” says I only tell half
the tale. I could tell the whole tale, but few people
would believe it in the South. I have seen yellow gins
bartered for and sold by white men to Mongolians. On
the big stations I have seen half-caste children given
away by their white fathers to a man on a neighboring
cattle run. On some of these stations the half-caste girls
are taught almost from infancy what they are to become.
I asked one half-caste child of eight or 10 what she was
going to be. The reply came at once: “Stud
gin.” Ask the gins who are the fathers of the
half- and quarter-castes, and you will be astounded to
bear the names. It is perfectly true, for instance,
about a former Government Resident leaving a nu-
merous family of hybrid children behind him. I know
of two who lived with tin-scratchers near Brock’s Creek.
It is all looked upon as an immense joke in Combo-land.
There should most certainly be concentration camps
formed for the natives. Meanwhile, where are the
philanthropic societies that boast of elevating the savage?
Have they no sorrow for the little black and brindle girls
in their own North? People, I know, will say, “Oh,
dra\v a veil over that matter ! The country is young and
white women are rare.” Of course, all reasonable people
will acknowledge the conditions are unusual; but,
surely, the most easy-going will admit that, to allow
children to be sold to Asiatics and others is a deplorable
state of affairs.

“Hayseed”: A couple of years back I
yi’g,s in South Australia with a pocketful of hard-
earned cash, looking for a farm. I found the
trap-door to the Bottomless Pit. I had gone
down to a south-eastern district to see a place,
and was standing in the yard, arguing the price
with the owner, when suddenly a shrill humming
and screeching came from the well, which was
near-by. It sounded like a Band of Hope being
murdered with a circular saw. “ Oh, that’s no-
thing,” said the farmer; “when I was sinking
that there well, about 50ft. down the spade went
clean into a hole, and the wind roared out like as
if the world’s tyre had been punctured. Some-
times it blows like that for hours, and that cold
you can bet the middle of the earth ain’t on fire
anywhere.” I was just going over to have a look
at the well when it let out a fearful roar and
started rattling its lid, although there wasn’t a
breath of wind on the surface. The sale negotia-
tions were off, quick and final, and I scooted for
home. No farm’s any use to me that has Satan’s
private freezing-chamber in the back yard.

“ Tindog,” from the windy Nor’-West: —
“ Dandalup ” (B. 18/8/T0) is right—sharks don’t tidy up
and make things comfortable under water for the diver.
They are ravenous. You dare not have a spot of fat
about your dress, or they will try to bite it out. Soap,
however, can be plastered round the wrist to keep water
from creeping through. There’s a local yarn that a
lugger hand got a gash, and some of the blood fell on the
anchor, just being lowered. The boat,instead of remain-
ing stationary, flew out to sea. A 20ft. shark had smelled
the blood and swallowed the anchor.
THE ELECTRIC FARM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Many farms in the U.S. are now almost wholly worked
by water-generated electric power.— Agricultural note.
The brook that babbled years ago beyond the sunken
fence
Is babbling still, but nowadays that brook is babbling
sense;
A crooning turbine sits by it and translates hour by hour
The chatter of that idle stream into electric power.
The boy that fished the little stream has to the city gone ;
But still the grindstone that he loathed is whirling gailv
on ;
The hated “ chores ” he always dodged or furtively for-
sook
Are done with pleasure by the cheap and eager little
brook.
The rough, hired man who worried dad and drove the
plodding team
Is somewhere in the city now amongst the oil and steam ;
His old-time job is now the brook’s —his labor is its
play ;
And dad is richer now he’s saved the hired man’s weekly
pay.
The old horse-team has trotted off to graze in pastures
new ;
The manic of the streamlet moves the implements it
drew;
Across the fields its work is done without it ev’ry day,
And never to the farmer comes a bill for chaff or hay.
The churn, the thresher and the pump, the hayfork and
the saw
Go tirelessly in cold or heat without the slightest “ jaw ’’;
The separator whines its song until its job is done.
All just because a water-wheel thinks working things is
fun.
In ev’ry room there is a fan, in ev’ry spot a light;
You never need to take a lantern with you now at night;
No one has any need, these days, to fear an angry cook ;
The kitchen, like the wide-spread fields, is managed by
the brook.
In laundry and in blacksmith’s shop, in milking-shed and
barn,
The brook remarks : “ For hours of ease I do not care a
darn 1
Just let me at the jobs you have and go and find me
more ;
The water runs through all the hours and I have power
in store.”
Deep down below the rip’ning wheat the bedded cables
send
A steady stream of servile force to be the farmer’s friend ;
A finger on a button pressed—the work is under weigh ;
In fifty minutes that is done which used to take a day.
The world turns easily, these times, instead of creaking
round,
As when men labored for a wage with faces to the
ground ;
And in the sleepy purring of the farmer’s dynamo
I hear a new voice hinting at the tides that ebb and flow.
In its low, dreaming monotone it talks of days to be,
When giant mains will bring inland the waste strength
of the sea ;
Of smokeless cities garden-clad, of busy miles of mills,
’Mid air as pure as that we breathe upon the bushland
hills.
The brook that babbled years ago beyond the sunken
fence
Is babbling still, but nowadays that brook is babbling
sense;
A crooning turbine sits by it and translates hour by hour
The chatter of the stream into a treasury of power.

G.P. (M.L.): The beginning of it:
Bulletins, will you listen to
A Jangling verse from ine,
For I’ve been sight-seeing and exchanging views
And triping o’er the sea ;
The sea which some folks dread so much
Was very nice to me,
It was just the tiling, yes all the time,
More polite it could not be.
“Triping o’er the sea” puts it very neatly. Very few
bards have the courage to admit the triping Jay B. P.:
The close-typed MS. that dazzles the eye like a strip of
wall-paper with an intricate pattern is generally poor
stuff. Quite impossible to sub-edit matter which is sent
in as a solid block. (Other paper-saving contributors
please note.) ...S.G.-R.: Yarn is now in the office tomb.
... .S. G.-Rothwell: This is your version :
And when the gloaming comes
Low in the heather blooms
Sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be
Emblem of happiness
Blest is thy dwelling-place—
To abide in the desert witli thee.
And this is the version of James Hogg, who was born in
1782 and died in 1835 :
Then, when the gloaming comes,
Low in the heather blooms,
Sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be,
Emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling-place—
Oh ! to abide in the desert with thee !
Now, did Hogg steal it from you, or did you steal it from
Hogg?.. . W.H.: Not going to argue about it. But you
say yourself that Fat is the result of “ an excessive
economy of physical exertion,” which is pretty much the
same as saying that it is an accumulated force Rodd
Rowan: Don’t blame the Post Office. Quite likely they
came. For the thousandth time, we don’t (and can’t)

B.J.: Nothing doing Spec (V.): Poor, uneven
verse Demijohn: “ Groping ” received. Your rhymes
be upon your own head ; we know of nothing heavier.
.... A.V.: Unsuitable H.C.A. : Thanks ; will think it
over. At present it strikes us that the guarantee system
of railway building is better Yarrum : Can’t see much
difference between the man who reaches for a twopenny
tip in England and the man who looks for a bob tip in
Australia, except that the latter has less excuse. He gets
a living wage, while the man who lives in the shade of the
Freetrade curse very often doesn’t get any kind of wage....
Tiaki (M.L.): Gentle mechanical verse. It lacks a joint
in one place, and has a foot or two to spare in another...
A. 8.: Fail to see the humor of it. If 40 women help to
feed 20 bishops with buns and tea, the function has no
public interest unless one of the bishops eats too much
and goes off with aloud —orgrossly exaggerated—report.
Plave not heard that any of the prelates perished in this
way. Incidentally, the verses are quite hopeless....
Butterfly (Q.): Hover for a minute over the last verse :
I found you one day in my heart,
Its rooms were chill and bare.
But now, though crowded, only one,
One face, one shape is there.
That suggests a lodger’s ghost in a ruined boarding-
house, whose furniture and effects are being sold at
auction. Don’t divide your heart into apartments next
time you write a poem —call it a furnished house
Kookaburra: Not strong enough to fly yet G.W. :
“Snakes” too young—no bite in them....A.8.F.: The
lines are weary, and the pen-name is the property of
another writer. Go out and wave this red rag at the
maddest-looking bull in the district. Make excitement
for yourself somehow, and shake up your liver.... The
Quack: Disqualified A.S.M.: Not bright enough
M.M.: Application for poet’s license refused....A.J. :
“ The controversy re hobble skirts is beginning to bore
us." Then whj 7 send half a column more to bore other
people?... .Vax : Yes, the same man.... Asparagus:
Can’t serve you up in this paper; you’re too green.

Two cables published, one day lately, sug-
gested that there is a lack of stability about
things. The first was to the effect that a White
Paper, issued in Berlin, stated that the turbine
engine had revolutionised German shipbuilding,
and had proved most satisfactory in the naval
and mercantile marine. The last line was sig-
nificant : ‘“There are now in course of construc-
tion 42 turbine warships.” Just below was
another cablegram of three lines: “The British
Admiralty has ‘ scrapped ’ six battleships of the
Royal Sovereign class, which originally cost
415,546,532.” These Royal Sovereigns were once
the most formidable of the big fighting ships. Of
14,150 tons, they were protected by armor belts of
18in., as against the llin. of the Dreadnought
class ; they carried four 13’5in. guns, whereas the
Dreadnoughts carry only 12in. boomers, and
back them up with 10‘6in. smashers. On paper,
there was no better second line of defence to
which a badly-mauled squadron could have trans-
ferred its crews to deal out fresh trouble to the
battered victors- But, apparently, the ship that
has be C ome obsolete in any way is right out of the
hunt, and of the eight Royal Sovereigns six have
been thrown aside. They could only work up to
a maximum speed of 14’5 knots, and that fact
appears to have made them useless.

The Melbourne committee of the
Property Owners’ Association has
issued the following statement with
reference to the Federal Land Tax:
“That in nearly all the States there
arc existing land taxes, and that in
three States the Government finds it
necessary to Impose further land taxa-
tion for revenue purposes. In face of
this, the insistence upon the penal rates
of the Federal tax is so unnecessary
and so confiscatory that the committee
can only conclude that the Federal
is a calculated attack on capital.’’

Doolette, who is alleged to have refused
£400,000 for the new Bullfinch gold mine in the
West, belongs to a family that can’t complain of
its luck. The father, G. P., was a tailor with a
large clerical connection, who threw in with the
little Adelaide syndicate that sent a prospecting
party out from Coolgardie. That put him into
the Great Boulder; afterwards he shifted to
London, and was for years the Boulder’s chair-
man. D. L., the man who has had the luck this
time, was sent out to the Boulder and put under
the eye of “ Dick ’’ Hamilton, the manager ; and,
after a while, Hamilton sent him to Southern
Cross; and the Doolette luck did the rest.
Edward Fox, of Australia, seaman, lately
put in some fine work off the coast
of Norway. He left Australia .
nine months ago, after 14
years in the local coastal
trade, and being anxious
to get back again
shipped as an A.B. on
the Norwegian bar-
que, Svaerstadt,
bound for Sydney.
According to the
current issue of
Lloyd’s
The Svserstadt
struck a rock, in
the midst of a
snowstorm shortly
after leaving
Archangel, and
broke into three
pieces. The fore-
part sank at once.
The midship sec-
tion, filled with lum-
ber, floated clear.
The poop remained
fast upon the rock,
but liable at any
moment to slip off
into deep water.
Believing that safety
lay in reaching the
midship section of the
vessel at all costs, Fox
snrang on to it from
the poop before it had
been carried too far. A
Norwegian seaman, who
followed him, fell into
the sea. Fox plunged
in to save him. ...
Fox next set to work to
make a rafr. from the lum-
ber. This he launched, and,
getting it near to the poop,
invited the captain to jump
in and get hold of it. The
captain declined, whereupon
Fox threw him into the water,
and then pushed and pulled
him and several others of the
crew into safety.
The captain’s daughter had been
asleep when the catastrophe occurred,
and was clad only in her nightdress.
Taking her on his back, Fox plunged
into the sea, and by the help of the raft
pot her on to the midship portion of the
barque. Then, divesting 1 himself of his
oilskins and some other portions of his cloth-
ing, he gave them to the shivering girl.
Returning for the rest, Pox found a man over
the side, almost exhausted. With this man on
his hack, Pox swam about for some time before he
could (ret his burden hoisted on to the poop. The
midship portion of the barque then drifted under the
lee of the poop, and all the rest of the crew managed to
clamber on to it.
Under the direction of Fox all hands made a raft which
should carry them ashore. When near land, huge
breakers capsized the raft, but all pot safely ashore, Fox

performance, refer to him variously as “the lion-
hearted English tar,” “the resourceful British
seaman,” and “the dauntless Briton.” In fact,
England has adopted Fox with enthusiasm ; and
indeed he is a mariuer whom any country might
be proud to own.
George Walker, who for 47 years has
sailed between Port Jackson and Twofold Bay in
the service of the Illawarra Co. and its prede-
eessors, went out of commission last week. Join-
ing as A.B. in 1863, Walker presently got Ins
ticket as second mate, rose to be master, and
retires commodore of the fleet. During all his
time he neither had an accident nor cost his
owners a penny in compensation.
The arm of coincidence dragged the last
parson to be elected to an Australian Parliament
into the seat named after the first ditto. Both
Lang and Crawford, the first and the last, stepped
out of a IScotchbyterian pulpit. In one respect
they differ. Lang could never be torn away
from his big, fat umbrella. He carried it always,
swinging it viciously and prodding enemies as he
went. Crawford, who carries no umbrella as a
rule, isn’t such a picturesque old party; but he
promises to be useful.
Southern Cross, the nearest township to
the sensational Bullfinch gold rush, was the first
of Westralia’s eastern goldfields. The place was
named in ISBB by a prospector named Riseley,
who was out for the Phcenix Syndicate. The
man who caused the prospecting to start there-
abouts was called Glass; he was a selector at
Mugakine, who found a speck while sinking a
dam. He sank more dams all over the shop ; but
struck nothing but water and wild eats. Other
people fell into Glass’s holes, and the Government
helped Colreavy’s party to do some prospecting ;
but Anstey’s party was the first to strike
luck, lhat was at Yilgarn. A goldfield was
then formally proclaimed. It was to the Cross
that the discovery of Coolgardie had to be re-
ported : Bayley was the lucky man that time,
though feylvester Brown, Rolf Boldrewood’s big
brother, who turned up at the right moment and
bought the show for £6OOO and a fourth interest,
had more luck than anybody else connected witn
the business.
Johann Godfred Engsfc, whose departure
for the Place of Rest was cabled from Maoriland
last week, was the last of the daring Moravian
missionaries who carried the Tract into the
Chatham Islands nearly 70 years ago, and, m
doing so, took about the same risk as Daniel
when he carried faith into the lions’ den. Engst was
born in Prussia, in 1819,_ jtnd when 22 years
of age was despatched to M.L. from Bremen.
He reached Otago in 1842, and in 1813,
with three or four companions, landed at
the Chathams. The Islands were the
home of the Morioris, people older than
the Maoris ; but unfortunately they were
strong believers in the Peace Society’s
policy of no-defence, and a hungry horde
of the Ngati Mutunga and Ngati Tama
tribes bore down on them from the
mainland. The murder orgie that fol-
lowed was awful, and the subsequent
cannibal feast was probably a record.
When Engst arrived, a few years later,
there was very little Moriori left; and
he has practically outlived the survivors.
To-day only five pure-blooded Morioria
remain—three men and two women. One
of the latter is a very aged wahine, and
the other is married to a Maori.
From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
The absentee Coopers are still offering their Sydney
properties for sale. The site of the historic Waterloo
warehouse, which was built bv the original Daniel
Cooper in Is2o, is now being put upon the market.
There is 153 ft. to George-street by 88ft. to Market-street.
The former frontage includes, in addition to the Waterloo
warehouse site, that which used to be occupied b]Jt
Lanneelpfc Iredale, who started an ironmongery business
alongside Dan Cooper's dealer’s store in the same year.
The Iredale business was captured by Fred Lassetter,
who married a Miss Iredale, and removed to the opposite
side of the street in the early Ws.

A quaint human remnant lectured last
week before the Australian Historical Society in
Sydney—a Miss Grace Hendy Pooley, who hasn’t
yet heard that a white population is growing and
flourishing in North Queensland. Grace wants to
fill the Northern Territory with hostile niggers,
on the ground that the white man hasn’t yet
occupied the place during his short stay in Aus-
tralia, and if you don’t occupy a place instantly
you should make an enemy a present of it. The
lady has already—so it is rumored on bad authority
—given her spare bedroom permanently rent free
to a Chinese family, by way of living up to her
creed.
On the passenger list of the Death Canoe :
Eahera te Kahuiapo.—On October 12, 1910, at Tauranga,
Kahera te Kahuiapo, a chieftainess of the Arawa and
Ngaiterangi tribes, aged 97 years.
The deceased was from the Ariki line of the Hapus:
Ngati-Pikiao, Waitaha, Ngati-Pukenga, JN'gati-Te-Takinga
and Nga-Potiki.
She was a direct descendant of Tania-te-Kapua, the
chief of the Arawa canoe, and also of Hei, Rangitihi,
Toroa, Waitaha, Pikiao. Tuparahaki, Pukenga, Tutanekai,
and of other Chiefs of the Canoes Arawa, Matatua, and
Tainui, which crossed the Pacific Ocean to Maoriland.

Traces of a being on shore may be discovered,
Those on the ocean never.
The thrust of a spear shaft may be parried,
That of death never.
Thomas Martin, who died at North
Sydney last week, had two claims to distinction—
his age (he was SO) and the fact that he was a
brother of James Martin, the ablest C.J. that
N.S.W. has known. John Martin, the father of
Thomas and James (and, incidentally, of John,
who became a solicitor, and George, who was a
P.M.), came to Australia in the early days as
groom to Governor Brisbane. He had his sons
carefully schooled; but, except James, they
turned out dullards. Thomas leaves a sister, old
John Martin’s last surviving offspring.

Harry Levien is still father of N.S.W.
Assembly. He entered Parliament when barely
of age, 30 years ago, knew nothing seriously about
politics, fell in with a crowd of similarly minded
Parliamentarians, and has played the game on the
same lines ever since. Twenty years back there
were about a score of members like Harry Levien
in N.S.W. Assembly; now he sits alone, the
Father of the House, the sole survivor of an old
order, which payment of members did most to kill.
In the new N.S.W. Labor Ministry there
are four Australians-born—Beeby, Education and
Labor ; Donald Macdonell, Chief Secretary ; and
Trefle and Carmichael, the two hon. Ministers.
Holman, Attorney-General, is a native of Eng-
land ; so are Edden (Mines) and Flowers (Legis-
lative Council). Nielsen (Lands) was born in
Denmark, and McGowen (Premier) was born at
sea. As to trades, McGowen is, or was, a boiler-
maker, Holman a cabinet-maker, and, later, a
barrister, Macdonell a shearer, Nielsen a car-
penter, Griffith a school-teacher, Edden a coal-
miner, Beeby a solicitor, Trefle a farmer, and,
later, a journalist, and Carmichael an accountant.
“ Boswell,” on a man who has no luck :
Barney Grogan, the tribune of Yass (N.S.W.), has
probably run more seconds than any other starter in
modern times. Thrice as a supporter of Bill Lyne and
co. he attacked Yass, a Tory stronghold held by the old
Scottish storekeeper, “Wullie" Affleck. Then Federa-
tion came and Barney ran for Werriwa, but didn’t run
fast enough. Blaming Niels Nielsen for his defeat, he
crossed over to Deform and attempted to win Yass back
to Toryism. More missed ’hus. At the Federal elections
of 1910 Barney, now boomed by the Tory press, skeltered
off to the Hume to demolish his old chief, Lyne. The
demolition of Barney by two to one followed automatic-
ally. A candidate being urgently required against Niel-
sen on October 14, 1910, Mr. Grogan obliged. Unless
I have lost count, this brings Mr. Grogan’s seconds up to
seven, and he is no nearer being a legislator now than he
was when the count was only one.
Samuel Elyard, who died lately at Nowra
(N.S.W.), aged 94, belonged to one of the oldest
Australian families. He was himself in the
Colonial Secretary’s office, but retired in 1868
on a pension of £206 13s. 4d., which he drew
for 42 years. The Elvards have been connected
with the Civil Service since the 20’s of last
century. The first Australian Elyard was a
surgeon in the Royal Navy; in the ’4o’s, a son,
William, was Chief Clerk in the Colonial Secre-
tary’s office, while another brother had become
Chief Clerk in the Supreme Court. When Re-
sponsible Government became a fact, William
Elyard was the first Under-Secretary ; ex-Justice
Owen was his successor. The deceased Samuel
had to be content with less exalted jobs, though
one of the papers gave him an under-secretaryship
too.
TO JAMES McGOWEN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Would you sit on a throne that is safe from shook,
Would you follow a path that is plain, Jimmy?
Would you hold a sceptre that doom can mock
Till the people’s foes are slain, Jimmy?
The road is {rood and the end is sure.
There’s never a slip or fall, Jimmy,
For the word that wins and will still endure
Is Australia first of all , Jimmy.
The little State Frights are a Premier’s snare,
And they’re dirty things at the best, Jimmy ;
Think wider thoughts, and you needn’t care
When it comes to the final test, Jimmy.
The land is wider than New South Wales,
And the whole is more than the part, Jimmv ;
But the man succeeds where the weakling fails,
And it’s all a question of heart, Jimmy.
The rising tide that is near its flood
Ne’er flowed from the parish pump, Jimmy,
And the ancient methods of raising mud
Can never be worth a dump, Jimmy ;
There are bigger stars in the eastern skies
And a bigger light will break, Jimmy,
And the people will follow the man who tries
To be big for the big day’s sake, Jimmy.
There is large work set to your hand to do,
And a long straight furrow to plough, Jimmy
And a whole wide State is looking to you
As the hope of the people now, Jimmy.
The petty spites of the past are gone ;
Don’t shut your ears to the call, Jimmy,
For the word that will carry you safely on
Is Australia first of all, Jimmy.

MISERY FOR YEARS
WITH INDIGESTION.
A Constant Sufferer tells how
She was Cured*
.. . .. —-r l —;
After suffering severe attacks of indigestion
after almost every meal’for years, Mrs. M. Shorter,
of Toowoomba, Queensland, tried the tonic treat-
ment, which aims at increasing the strength of
the stomach so that it can digest food properly.
Her experience was remarkable, for she found
speedy relief, and can now, for the first time in
many years, eat an ordinary meal with comfort.
Mrs; Shorter, who lives in Mort Street, stated :
“For many years I had been troubled with
indigestion. As sure as I took a meal I would
get a suffocating sort of pain in my chest almost
directly after, .and I would feel a weighty pain
right through to my shoulder blades. 1 would be
quite weighed down with it and hardly able to
breathe. I could not bear my clothes to be at all
tight on me. I never could find any appetite for
fear of. indigestion coming on after. I could
hardly bear to even cook the food, the smell
would upset me, I had such dreadful headaches,
too. All my head seemed whirling, and the ache
would press over my eyes till I could hardly see.
I would be afraid to stoop, for the blood would
rush to my head and make me dizzy. I turned
awfully yellow and sallow. Sometimes, too, a
regular mist would come over my eyes. I would
wake up every morning with a sour, acid taste
that stayed on me for hours, and my tongue was
always furry and dry. My system would be full
of wind. All the time I would be despondent
and wretched ; but I made up my mind to give
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills a trial, and since I
finished the course my health has been splendid.
Now I can eat anything I fancy, and the constant
load and the weariness have all gone. My color
has come back, and I feel a different being alto-
gether.”

thing which he says is “ just as good.” If you

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Labor Government of S.A. has put
; down <a somewhat dilatory hoof on the bloated
eornsack. In future the railway rate upon it will
be, in proportion to its weight, four times that on
the 2001 b. sack, - That makes the dropsical bag an
outlaw, and its,career is.ended.
King O’Malley, the Clown with the Big
Hat, suggests that the Australian capital at Yass-
: berra should be called Shakspeare. Judging by
the particular sort of feather that O’Malley wears
in his political tail, one might have expected him
to suggest calling the place Rooster. But why
not stick to the old natural designation of the
town—Mud?'
Victorian Minister Graham’s latest de-
scription of the people of Australia is " a band of
brigands.” At least he alleges that “a band of
brigands ” is stealing the rights of the States and
transferring them to the Commonwealth, and as
the people of Australia, acting by referendum,
can alone do anything of that sort he doubtless
alludes to them.
• Premier Murray, of Victoria, now proposes
another base interference with Private Enterprise.
His Railway Lands Acquisition Bill, if the
Fat Landlords pass it, will give the State
power to acquire lands for township purposes near
proposed' railway stations on new or existing lines.
Truly, Fat’s chances of exploiting the public get
skimpier every day, and a horrible morning may
■ yet break when he will actually have to get work.
The published remarks of one of the
“expert irrigationists” that Victoria has just
been earnestly’seeking in foreign parts :
I know absolutely nothing about farming. I have been
jin the Bank of England, employed as a clerk, and have
jlived near London for some years.
Apparently he was parsed through as an “expert
irrigationist? on the: strength of his intimate
acquaintance with the, water-marks on the bank
motes he has been handling all his life.
“Vulcan”: Sin'ce October 14, 79,301
jpersons, mostly of extended girth, have risen to
state, in the voice of a man who has just negoti-
ated a bad oyster, that they are (1) “ glad,” (2)
“'“delighted,” (3) “never-more pleased in their
lives,” and (4) “filled with'thankfulness,” that the
Labor party is in, and are only (1) “ grieved,”
(2) “extremely sorry,” and (3) “greatly disap-
pointed,” that its majority is two instead of 20,
as with such a majority Labor would provide
itself with enough rope in a year to hang itself
stone-dead for the next 50. Seeing that “Liberals”
are bo sure that a big majority was the only thing
that was wanted' to kill the Labor party .so dead
for so long, what licks me is why they didn’t give
it the majority. As they didn’t, I can’t quite
make out whether; they, were fools before the
elections or liars afterwards.
Westralia’s scratch Ministry lately sacked
a prison warder because he refused to resign from
the local militia garrison artillery. He had
attended drills, etc., in his own time, and no
fault was found with him as a warder; also, he
had fulfilled both functions for two years with-
out anybody noticing anything calamitous. But
the State Frighters suddenly discovered a chance
to be nasty to the Australian Government, and
the victim was run out. The only excuse given
is that warders are exempt from service under
the Defence Act; but as they are not exempted
from military training, that excuse won’t hold
water.
In the Vic. Assembly the other day, Plain,
of Geelong, asked whether it wasn’t a fact that
large quantities of wheat were dragged past
Geelong to Melbourne, at an extra charge of only
Bd. per ton for the 40 miles. John Weary
admitted that it was a fact, and added :
It would doubtless be advantageous to the Department
to have all the wheat from stations beyond Geelong
delivered at that place, hut ... the Commissioners are
strongly in favor of the continuance of the existing prin-
ciple.
The fact is, that while it would be “advan-
tageous to the Railway Department,” and while
it would also be advantageous to Geelong, it
would not be advantageous to Melbourne. And
nothing matters apparently, except Melbourne.
Admiral Henderson, the British authority
who is travelling round Australia to report on
suitable sites for a naval base, has already been
loudly informed by the Sydney daily press that,
if he recommends any site save Sydney, he will
be the animal that Balaam rode upon, and the
Melbourne press has given him a similar broad
hint about Westernport (Vic.). Henderson came
plodding down the coast the other day, and a
great effort was made to drag some expression of
opinion out of him. But he only wore a far-off
expression, and remarked in a non-committal way
that Gladstone, the neglected port of Central
Queensland, is a very fine harbor. Luckily, he
said nothing about the adjacent river port of
Rockhampton. If he had, his remarks might
have set that town on fire. •• ■
A rule that has not been deviated from in
the recollection of the oldest Crown Law official,
lays it down that all capital matters shall be
dealt with within .a week, of ; the offender
being sentenced. It is a wholesome rule, too.
But Wade kept the murderer Phillips in the con-
demned cell for the unprecedented period of jive
weeks! The only possible explanation is that
Phillips was being used as a pawn to discommode
the McGowen Government, presuming it climbed
to office.' 'lt was sly,'devilish sly; but emphati-
cally it wasn’t “playing the game.” It didn’t
amount to “cricket.” In fact, it was more like
pitch and toss with a double-headed penny.
The cocksure people who are quite certain
that a country must wilt unless it parcels out the
lands in freehold might do worse than take a trip
to Java. A man couldn’t buy a farm from the
Government in Java if he took along the whole
Bank of N. S. Wales to pay for it; in fact, the
only freeholds there are in the island are a few
that were granted close upon a century ago ; and
the Government reckons the system so unsatis-
factory as compared with leasehold that it is now
buying them back again. Many of the freeholds
have drifted into the hands of a few rent-sucking
Chinese, and the people who live on them are the
poorest in the island. The leasehold parts have,
on the other hand, been so amazingly developed
that the population has increased from 3,500,000
in 1795 to about 35,000,000 at present; and this
/paper doesn’t know any other country in the
vyorld—freehold worshippers thrown in—that can
get within cooee of that record.
The Osborne Judgment, as it is commonly
called, is still making a heapof trouble in Britain.
It was a legal decision to
the effect that trades union
funds must not be used to
help Labor candidates. Now
in Bull’s slummock y
country- there is no pay-
ment of members, nor is
there any £lOO limit on a
.candidate’s expenditure. It
costs, on an average, nearly
£lOOO to get one individual
into the House pf Commons
(the candidates have even
to pay the returning
officers’ wages),' and with
the most desperate economy
the Labor party' only
managed it at a cost of
about £650 per man. The
trades unions found the
money and also ■ paid- a
salary to each Labor mem-
ber ; but the law now says
that they mustn’t, do it
again. So, as the average
Labor man hasn’t £650
about him, there will either
be no more Labor candi-
dates, or there must be
payment of members. On
present appearances, there
will be payment of mem-
bers. If the Asquith
Ministry says no the
Labor party may vote
against it, and if the Labor
party does that, the
Asquith Ministry might as
well cut off its own head
and throw it overboard.
From a paper con-
tributed by Sulman,
F.R.1.8.A., to the International Town-planning
and Housing Conference in London
The [Australian] Federal capital was never likely to be-
come a manufacturing city, as it possessed neither coal-
field nor sufficient water to generate more power than was
required for tramways and lighting. What the ultimate
size might be no one could tell, but his impression was
that for many years the population would not exceed
50,000, while it might grow in course of time to 100,000.
And yetthe Sydney Telegraph deliberately sup-
ports the idea to make a national capital at Yass-
berra, though this expert, who is one of the
paper’s directors, tells it that the place can never
be more than a village. Or, to say what is more
likely to be the truth, it supports Yassberra
because its expert director tells it that the national
capital can’t ever be of any account if it is fixed
there.
“ Bosun ” turns sea-lawyer :
Premier Joseph Ward threatens to shove off the P. and
0. nigger by defining the inter-Maoriland-Austrslian trade
as coastal, thus bringing all the vessels in the service
under the conditions of the law applying to the Maori-
land coast. Then, to get square with Ram Chunder in
the foreign trade, Ward suggests the imposition ofasurtax
on all passenger tickets and bills-of-lading on deep sea
steamers arriving in and departing from M.L. manned by
colored crews. As far as departures, at any rate, are con-
cerned this step may be feasible, and was suggested by
Prime Minister Fisher six months back. The other
scheme is, however, not so easy : for Australia cannot be
classed as part of M.L. by an ordinary Act of Parliament.
The safest course to follow is to seek Commonwealth co-
operation, especially with a Labor crew on deck, bearing
in mind that the Commonwealth Navigation Bill is pre-
paring a wallop for the colored tar, and that two wallops
are better than one.
ANOTHER UNION TROUBLE.
THE CLERK: “I should like a rise in wages,
sir; I’m, about to be married.”
THE BOSS: “ Rubbish, rubbish, young man! I'm
against all unions, on principle.”
“Liberal” members of the S. Australian
Assembly who have held Ministerial office for years
were worrying Premier Jack Verran because he has
not raised the wages of clerks in the Government
service “who" are getting less than navvies.”
Jack’s characteristic retort : “ It’s like your
daring cheek. Some of you chaps were bosomed
in the Treasury for 10 years, and what did you
do? We cap’t wipe up all your messes in one
day’s cleaning.”
Peter Bowling, of Newcastle, appears to
be suffering badly from swelled head—so badly
that it is a wonder he didn’t stick in the doorway
of the gaol as he came out. “Is there any repre-
sentative of the Labor Government here to-
night,” he shouted at a recent meeting, “ to thank
me for getting them into power t ” That was really
tremendous. All the talk about Bowling’s leg-
irons probably didn’t secure the party one vote ;
it only appealed to the people whose votes were
safe in any case. Certain happenings that stam-
peded a lot of old “Liberals” over to Labor were
the rush of big loans, the appalling reckless-
ness of Wade’s railway superannuation pro-
mises, the alarm that was raised when it
was known that he seriously proposed to
open a money-lending emporium which would
advance up to 95 per cent, of the alleged value of
the security, his clumsy dodgery over the Closed
Ports, and the insane waste of money over
litigation which only made the State Government
a laughing-stock. A heap of folk who regarded
the imprisonment of Bowling as a most commend-
able proceeding were scared by these wild and
woolly proceedings. They smote certain sections
of Fat with terror, and made him think that the
Treasury had gone mad and had haystacks in its
hair. But that same Fat wouldn’t have cared if
Bowling had been sold to a slave-dealer in Central
Africa.
TRAINED TO FOLLOW.
(The day after the Rave.)
SAUCY SUSAN : “ Pooh! Pooh! Hilly old horse—
came in last! ”
ANGRY HENRY : “So would you if you was
trained for a pack-horse.”
N.S.W. Minister Griffith’s proposal to
establish a State brickwork to supply the Works
Department with bricks has at least old precedent
behind it. A certain Pharaoh did the same thing,
and it is notable that the Scriptural objection was
not to Pharaoh’s State enterprise, but to the
cheap labor conditions under which it was run.
A good Arbitration Act might have altered the
course of the world’s history. The warlike
Hebrews might have remained in Egypt, and
with this accession of strength that country might
have chewed the ear of all comers. In fact, a
Potiphar Or Amasis might now be Governor-
General of Australia, and there might be pyramids
in Woolloomooloo.
The Cohuna (Vic.) land inquiry commis-
sion learnt nothing very startling until it got to
the last witness to be called—the last excepting
EUvood Mead, now in foreign parts. This wit-
ness was a member of a syndicate formed to buy
land at Cohuna, and he was somewhat shy.
Finally, however, he was induced to hint that
O’Connor, the well-informed person who made so
much money by buying land and selling it at a
profit to the Closer Settlement Board, had got his
information from ex-M.L.A. Duggan, a then
member of the Board. And Duggan is since
dead. It is marvellous that the man responsible
for the trouble is always dead.
Fairbairn, M.H.R., speaking on the
Federal Land Tax, said (page 2324 of Hansard) :
“ As a rule the purchaser of land expects to-
make about five per cent, from it.” He was
dealing at the time with the big estates,
which would be subject to the Federal
Tax. In the same speech (page 2330) he
quoted from a letter dealing with the
Victorian Closer Settlement Board, im
which the writer stated: “In Mooralla.
the Board has yet five farms, averaging-
-600 acres, to dispose of, at prices rang-
ing from G3s. to 755. per acre” ; and the
illogical Fairbaitn added: “A good
farmer would make that off the land in
one year.” No better argument for a.
land tax has been supplied during the
debate. The large landholder makes
five per cent, from land from which'
the good farmer can make 100 per cent.
And yet Australia is told by Fairbairn
and others that the land held in big areas
is being put to its best use.
An English firm, which makes one of the
patent medical substances that you rub on to the
afflicted part of jour unwise carcase, has an-
nounced with great dignity that it will send no
more of its wet goods to Australia. It is offended
with the Australian Commerce Act, and, it says,
“ we retaliate by refusing to invest capital in the
Australian market.” Which is a silly case of cut-
ting off its ear to disoblige its feet, because Aus-
tralia will get on just as well with locally-made
eucalyptus, and will thereby keep a lot of good
money in the country.
Bathurst is a curious little N.S.W. con-
stituency which always votes to cut off its own
nose. It had a great chance in the old days to be
a manufacturing centre. Denny and Ashworth’s
foundry and Cobb and Co.’s coach works gave it a
“leg in” on the manufacturing course. But it
generally elected Freetrade Pumpkin Smith and
others .of that class, and its manufactures natu-
rally declined and expired. Now, when Labor is
prepared to file away the shackles of land mono-
poly, which prevent Bathurst from growing, the
Beautiful City of Lost Chances votes for its in-
dustrial leg-irons, hugs them to its breast, as it
were, and re-elects the man who stands for stagna-
tion and hard, times; for the only reason, appa-
rently, that somewhere, at some time in the
remote past, some strange men were in the habit
of burning utter strangers because they disagreed
as to the best way of getting to an uncharted
island in Space called Heaven.
THE PIRATE’S LAMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They (the Labor party) have hoisted the black flag and-
, declared a piratical war against Private Enterprise.—
0. S. Littlejohn , ex-president Sydney Chamber of Com-
merce.
The Jolly Roger is at the masthead in New South
Wales.—Daily paper item.
It seems to me a fearful time
Since first I stood, elate—
Hearing the Roger had been nailed
Unto the ship of State—
And yelled : “At last! Hip, hip, hooray 1
Looting may now start any day.”
I mind when Watson, years ago,
Achieved the helm, I tore
To where my-pi rate’s weapons lay
And donned them all. I wore
Sufficient ancient ironware,
Those days, to make a pawnshop staref
The weary weeks and months crawled by ;
People were born and died,
Businesses boomed and burst ; folks drank,
Loafed, toiled, laughed, cursed and'cried :
I viewed the pageant listlessly,
My thoughts all turned on piracy.
Often and often I despaired
And put my daggers by,
And iiid my guns and bombs and things
From any human eye.
And then some daily paper trope
Would give my drooping spirits hope.
I would have died, I often think,
When Watson’s gang passed out
Without one overt act of crime
But for the dailies’ shout
Of ““ Watch the hounds next chance they get;
They’ll plunge the State in Ruin yet.”
Oar murky Flag’s been notified
On vessels in South Oss,
The West and Q., and, strange to tell,
There was no public loss :
tfo homes were burst, no goods were grabbed,
No harmless Lib’rals shot or stabbed.
To-day, it seems, the Crossbones flaunt
From Noo South’s masthead peak :
Once more the old familiar howls
Are rising week by week,
And gloomy business-men forecast
That Chaos has arrived at last.
I’d like to think it had. And yet
Past happenings go to show
That Piracy’s as far away
As it Was years ago.
I ask for gore and loot and swords ;
I’m handed nought but empty words.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, November 1, 1910,
My Dear Artni,—
Wonderful are the fads of the tired and idle
rich ! The Marchioness of Bute is named Mary,
and the Queen is named Mary, so the former has
devised the brilliant idea that all females named
iMary, Maria, May or Marion should be urged to
-give anything from Id. to £1 to make up a corona-
■j° n the latter. This idea has struck the
idle rich as something’ good, and local committees
are being formed to chase Mary and Maria and
i May and Marion to her joint and several lair, and
go through her for the subscription. The matter
has been taken up by the woman with the big
hat; and the woman who wants to get
into society; and the woman who is in
society but wants to get further in; and by
Mrs. Malaprop with the newlv-made affluence,
who has given up all hope of ever getting into
society, and is humbly glad to rub shoulders
with it for an hour or so ; and by her friend Mrs.
rPraiamop, who is the same, only worse; and
they are being helped by the shabby-genteel
female, the decayed gentlewoman, and the people
who hang on to the fringe of things. All these
folk are to start in pursuit of Mary and Maria
and May and Marion, who will presently be seen
fleeing across the landscape with her horizontal
hair behind, her and her small savings between her
teeth. There will be four of her in line, Mary
with torn stockings and red hair, and Maria with
crinkled stockings and brown hair, and May with
elastic-sided boots and a struck-by-lightning hat,
and Marion with odd boots and curl-papers; and
she will all run like the Devil, leaving the dishes
unwashed in the kitchen and the cat unfed on the
shores of the kitchen sink. As the natural conse-
quence of this flight of Mary, Maria, May and
Marion into the waste places of the earth. Bridget
andi Jane, who remain behind, willincrease their
demands, and of Charlotte will be her
weight in fine gold, and Ann Slopp will become
scarce, like the cedar of Lebanon,'and will de-
mand the price of two whole cedars a week
for her services. Of course, Mary and Maria and
May and-Marion will be overtaken now and then,
and she will be got down and sat upon, and her
feet and hands will be held by an influential com-
' mittee which will stretch her out firmly; and
despite her ravings and her attempts to bite the
peerage she wilbbe searched and 2d. found upon
her, and then her spare corset will be taken from her
and pawned to make up the deficit. But with it all,
• the. ounces are that there will be harflly enough
plunder to be worth offering to Queen Mary on
coronation day.
The death of Colonel Mackenzie throws a host
of people into mourning. He married one of the
quttors of Bathurst. A daughter, who was Miss
{ Lute ” Mackenzie, married Mr. Russell Clarke
eg Victoria the recent acquirer of Rupertswood,
. the headquarters of the moneyed clan. Another
! is the wife of Mr. Colin Smith, racing-owner and
j ’V.??P er la(J y who wedded Captain Leslie
Wilson. A few years back the Mackenzies were
stationed at the Paddington Barracks, and
- Sydney saw a good deal of them. -Then-they
removed to Tasmania. Colonel Mackenzie had
only been back in Sydney a couple of months
when the end came.
■: Major Morris, R. A. A., who died suddenly last
week, was extremely popular in local club and
/Society circles. His father, Mr. Augustus
Morris, was a Sydney business man of prominence
in the old days, and a friend of Professor Bad-
. ham, Dr. Lang and the rest of the intellectual
giapts of the period. Latterly, the family had its
headquarters at Manly, where it was as well
known almost as the Corso.
-Miss Gwynneth Griffiths, of Sydney, and Mr.
Bakfer, of America, were married on Monday.
Mis. Griffiths was a Knox (the Knoxes stand for
the Sugar Co.), and when it was rumored that one
of the clan was to become matrimonially allied
‘ with the land of the Fried Ethiopian, there was
the saipe trouble as invariably occurred in Verona
whep a Capulet announced his or her irrevocable
intention of marrying into Trade. Howbeit, the
pair stood valiantly by their project, and when
the marriage-bells ultimately rang out, harmony
and perfect peace obtained all round. Mr. Baker
was editor of a paper in his own land, and surely
Journalism ought to stand a pace in front of
Sugar.
A few days before the wedding Miss Griffiths
gave a jolly children’s and grown-up party at
Bauman s Cafe. The youngsters were chiefly the
pretty bride’s pupils; for she has been a success-
rul and fashionable teacher of dancing. The
Dudleys and Clielmsfords had invoked her aid for
training their offspring in grace.
News of a heavy crop of engagements is float-
ing around m Sydney. Miss Neida Playfair, a
Jamb of the Edmund Playfairs, of Waverley,
is to marry a Dr. lan Macintosh, of Inver-
nesshire, Scotland. This bride-to-be must be
of very early spring date, for her mother
ipoles ouly about 12, especially when wearing
a short hobbled frock. Another match, struck
m .Hepyen, course (in Heaven matches
are struck on the angels’ haloes), is that of Mr.
Harry Morriss, of Shanghai and Stonebridge,
Miss Vera Samuel, eldest daughter of
Mrs. Frew, of Hyde Park (and other swell
addresses), and the late Mr. Louis Samuel, and
granddaughter of the Saul Samuel who was one
of our Agents-General. This Miss Orange-
blossom s mother Was a Miss Fowler, a noted
Sydney beautyun days of yore. A younger sistef
of the maternal lady is Mrs. Ralph \Vorrall.
Fashionable mania for hiding the light under
the.bushel no,-the veil—js becoming more acute.
Glittering, jewelled trimmings, hidden under
chiffon Or mnon-were “in” at the end of last
year. The present season will see the jewels
themselves half quenched as tofire by some semi-
transparent material. Necklaces, and pendants
of diamonds, rubies and turquoises, will go under,
not over, evening gowns ; even old lace is to be
only seen obscurely. The principal thing to be
said in favor of this fashion is that it helps to save
the jewels if they fall off.
St. Mary’s Fair is right upon its close, after a
breathless and most successful run of many
weeks. The warlike Cardinal’s appeal for funds
to finish the St. Mary’s temple has met with an ex-
traordinary response. You can hear 57,000
sovereigns talk further than you may hear heavy
artillery roar.
The vexed St. James parish has been put,
for the present at least, into the charge of the
Rev. the Dramaturgist Hillhouse Taylor. His
dramatic version of “Parsifal” brought J.C.W.
much coin, and by it Tittell Brune, who was its
Kundry, had several layers of fame added to what
had already grown around her. The earthquake
conditions that the Rev. the Dram. H. Taylor
managed so well in “Parsifal” he may find obtain
more or less in his new charge, but experience
will have taught him how to manage great natu-
ral forces such as earthquakes and Low Church
Primates.
A portrait of Lady Northcote illustrates an
article on the Austral Club in a high-class English
weekly. Our ex-Excellency-General is president
of the club, which seems to be thriving, and has a
membership of nearly 400. It started in a tea-
shop in Bond-street, but has now a home of its
own in Dover-street. Two Victorians, sisters.
Mrs. Alexander and Miss Myra Browne, launched
the little venture in the tea-shop in 1902. In
1910 Lady Northcote’s coronet coruscates at its
meetings. Miss Maggie Baxter’s remarkably pretty
portrait is also an illumination for the letterpress.
The Sydney girl is hon. sec. of the now portly
institution.
An uncle of our Governor-General Dudley has
put himself into the Fashionable Intelligence of
the English papers by the announcement of his
engagement. Mr. John Moncreiff is the youngest
brother of Georgina Lady Dudley. He is 40
years of age, and his bride-elect—a widow, Lady
Chesham, a daughter of the late Duke of West-
minster—has grown-up children.
The woman at home (our women are sometimes
at home; with Marv-Annism gone out of fashion
they have to be) will find Miss Fowler’s Cook
Book more ent< rt lining and useful than a number
of current novels. Miss Fowler is the teacher of
cookery at the Education Department’sCollegeof
Domestic Economy in Melbourne. Her recipes for
soups, fish, fowl, and red-meat cooking are varied,
generally simple and well arranged. There are
not many Hotel Ritz recipes, for the author in
her preface says her book is adapted to meet the
requirements of every-day use, and “the work
will be found to contain suggestions of value to
students, cooks and housekeepers, 'to whose in-
terest it is to make good food and good cookery
meet financial requirements.” Her sauces, sweets,
puddings, scones and sandwjch and other charms
and spells of cookery prove Miss Fowler to be a
most competent sorceress. A list of most useful
“ Things You Should Know,” from the washing Of
muslin curtains to the value of ground-ginger as a
poultice, close the Fowler Cook Book.
Concerning the noble art-of self-defence—mean-
ing cooking—papers to hand from London tell thit
the demand for cooks greatly exceeds the supply.
Housemaids, ladies’ maids and companions were
offering plentifully ; after cooks the. scarcity wis
in parlormaids. In Sydney you may still get a fairly
good cook if you don’t live too far from George-
street and Newtown. It is the one-maid job that
has no takers. Last week a lady, living in a
pretty flat in Macquarie-street, advertised for a
damsel to keep it in order. No washing or cook-
ing or care of children. Up to late in the
afternoon she had not had one application. So
the vaunted lure of living within five minutes’
walk of the post-office clock is not always irresist-
ible.
A man sends me this: Another reason for the
dearth of Mary Anne came to my knowledge last
week. The Education Department requires about
200 probationer teachers each year, and this year 1
it had 327 applicants—244 girls and 85 boys.
Presumably the pay and prospects are not good
enough to attract young men. It seems,
somehow, an unfortunate state of things. I
have always heard from the Jeremiahs who
talk about the birthrate, that woman’sreal mission
in life is to marry, and be a mother, and run a
happy home. The cook, the nurse and the Mary
Anne are all practising more or less the arts which'
tend to the keeping together of a home—china-
smashing, argument with the butcher, destruction
of the chop in Nebuchadnezzar’s furnace, “cheek-
ing ” the niissus, routing of the dishonest cat,
and such-like ; but the school-teacher appears
to be in a different category. When a.
woman struggles desperately to qualify for a
profession she often feels reluctant to abandon it
in order to keep house (which she probably can’t
do), and ruin a strange man’s food, and bathe a
problematical baby. She doesn’t care to leave
the work she can accomplish well in order to wash
the infant which she knows she wiil probably drop
on the floor. Then, even if she is willing to marry,
the fact that she has taken what might be otherwise
a man’s job diminishes her chance of finding a‘ ;
male who can afford to support her. And if an
eligible male should turn up he probably hesi-
tates to start housekeeping because of the
lamentable scarcity of Mary Anne, for which
his intended wife is partly responsible; and
ends by remaining a bachelor. Or if he takes
his digestion in his hand and marries, the same old
scarcity of Mary Anne, and his wife’s ignorance
of housekeeping (she never having Mary Ann-ed
herself) and her tendency to drop a slippery infant
on the hearth, probably make them decide to be a
childless couple in a hash-tower, which is
a dreary, unnatural existence, and leads to
laziness, dyspepsia, kimonas, slippers, dis-
ordered thatch and a perusal of sixpenny
novels on a black horse-hair sofa. That is the
woman’s half of the life; the man’s half, lam
told on bad authority, is mostly billiards.
Meanwhile, for want of Well-paid male teachers
to he husbands, there are too many old
maids teaching school, and doing it on
purely old maid principles, and frying in their
own blushes when they come across the word
“legs” in the daily lesson. The trouble seems
to work round in a circle, like a snake with its tail
in its mouth.
Captain Robertson Clark (who is private secre-
tary to the Governor of Maoriland) and Lady
Beatrice Clark have arrived in Sydney for a short
stay. The visit is mainly a'busmess one, necessi-
tated by the recent death of Mr. Clark, sen., of
Ghoolendaadi Station. Ghoolendaadi is a fine
property, and has had a run of good seasons;
but it has to support an extensive family.
One Clark girl married the station manager, and
abides on the estate. Two more live with their
mother in England, and are by way of being
social lights. One was included in the royal
house party at Balmoral last month. And there
is a brother in the British Diplomatic Service.
Amongst the Sydneysiders who went down-
to help rill the Cup and pledge the winner are
the Reggie Allens, the medical Kellys from the
North Shore, the Spencer Bruntons, 'Mrs.- Sam
Hordern, Miss Gwladys Bonsor, Mr. Owen Cox
and Dr. Spiers Kirkland. To be correct, the
last-named specialist “happens to be there ” for
the-Cup, for he is on his way back to Sydney after
a year’s stay and study in foreign parts.
A certain Sydney yachtsman is hurriedly get-
ting a lot of white linen creations. He is to be
the guest of Sir Thomas Lipton at the great tea-
man’s estates in Ceylon. The yacht Erin, with
Lipton and co. aboard, will be now about leaving
its English tethenngs for the trip. The co. in-
cludes a Battenberg prince—a 'brother of the
Queen of Spain.
Sponsors of the various “Australians Abroad”
columns mention that Mrs. John Toohey (of
Wahroonga) and her daughter are on a visit to the
Earl of Rothes, at Leslie House, in Fifesbire.
This Scottish peerage is interesting in a mild way,
from the fact that the succession runs in the
female line when the direct male line has a break
in it. There have been five countesses running
the Leslie show since 1031. The Hon. Edward
Courtenay Leslie, of Burria, Shoalhaven, in this
State, is, I am told, an uncle of the present Lord
Rothes.
Now, who was Miss Sophie Lashmore? I seem
to have seen (or heard) the name. Was it on a
bar of soap, or on a theatre programme, or a
dinner-list of Federal Government House? For-
get, though I’ve a vague idea she played one of
the Two Little Vagabonds in the late Mr.
Holloway’s company. * Anyhow, the damsel, who
is now Mrs. Reg Leeson, came out second in a
beauty competition held at St. Leonards, in
England. There were 17 competitors. Miss
Lashmore is a Sydneysider, so the bald note that
intimates the.triumph says.
The Earl of Yarmouth, whom a section of
Australia remembers with a sense of vague resent-
ment, as a weird-looking youth, possessed of
various queer hobbies, none of which was more
lamentable than that of publicly skirt-dancing
wherever he could get an audience to bear with
him, has broken out afresh. There was pre-
sented last month at the Court Theatre, London,
a musical play written and composed by this
particular nobleman. In it he sustained the
leading part, under the alias “Eric Hope.”
Also he produced the show, and, seemingly, is to
be financially liable in the likely event of its
proving a frost. The critics speak of it in such
guarded phrases as “a quite harmless affair,”
“simple,” “innocuous,” and so forth. These
terms suggest that grievous loss is likely to fall on
the Earl of Bloater.
The B. R. Wises’ only son Tony is nob pur-
suing the legal trail blazed by his father. After
leaving Oxford he went into a London shipping
office, and this week he departs from
the • Great Smoke for Calcutta, where he
will take up a billet at the head office
of the British India Steam Navigation Co.
The 8.1. is the fourth biggest steamship co. in the
world, I am told, ranking after the two huge Ger-
man companies and the White Star. Mrs. Wise,
who has been with her son in London, returns to “
Sydney by the Macedonia in January. Mr. Wise
proposes to meet her there, after visiting his off-
spring in the latter’s new Indian home.
Mrs. Arthur Macarthur has been seriously ill
in Lewisham Hospital, as a result of complica-
tions following on the horribly-prevalent and
unpicturesque complaint known as the mumps.
She was smitten with the epidemic at the begin-
ning of the September race-week, and later ib
developed into pleurisy.
The C. E. Waters welcomed a new arrival of
uncommon beauty at their lair in the Albany
quite recently. They have called the young lady
by the unusual names of Naomi Phillips.
Mr. Leslie Woods, of the Rickards realm, was
taking a pennyworth of tram lately when a man
with an Eye that glittered more dangerously than
that of the old mariner who' shot the albatross
commandeered him with a “Come along with
me.” The actor said he had an appointment.
The Eye and the man persisted that he was
wanted—at. church. The mummer said, “A.
playhouse, not a church, is where I’m wanted,”
and he slipped off the tram. The stranger
also slipped, and a, .girl with him joined in the
entreaty to the vaudeville man to “cohiie.” Then,
he realised that it was not his soul they wanted
only his_ body as a witness to their marriage. So-
he played the part of third person singular.
There was no wedding breakfast, mot even a cold-
tea cocktail, and the witness didn’t kiss tile bride.
Mr. and Mrs. “Steenie” Osborne ('she\vas Miss
Lawrence, of Melbourne) are expected in Sydney
in a few days. They are to proceed to the bride-
groom’s Monaro station, where all sorts of reno-
vations and additions have been occurring.
A lady who recently fainted outside Mayoress
Allen Taylor’s gate at Leura tells her friends that
never previously had she realised that a swoon
could be of such importance. And the friends
who were with her at the time declare That
they did not know such an " elegant suit
of pyjamas as that Mr. Forster Taylor wore:
on the night of the swoon could be seen anywhere
outside royal circles. The night was so rue hours
old, and none of the group of wayfarer A knew
whose house it was into which they hurried for-
restoratives. First, the Mayoress’s nurse ap-
peared, and proffered brandy ; then the Mayoress,,
to make sure that the sufferer had got the brandy;:
then the Mayoress’s son and heir, to make sure
that it was brandy ; and all three were so hos-
pitable that the fainting lady would have gone
home incapacitated from distilled spirit if she
had accepted all the offerings. But the beauty
of young Taylor’s pyjamas did more than the:
brandy to revive her.
The hon. sec. of the Child Study Association
writes to acknowledge with thanks a postal note
for ss. from “D.H.”; also £1 from “Some
Child ” (many weeks ago), and a parcel of cloth-
ing left by an unknown lady. This C.S.A.
charity is the Cinderella of all the charities. It
is poor and small, like the children it tries to
help, and like them has no influential helpers.
Its objects of help shiver alone on the rim of
things or swelter in close, germ-laden, over-
crowed tenements. Please, will every lady
named Mary, May, Maria or Marion or Martha
or Corisande.o.r .any name at all forward a mite
to the hon. sec. of the Association.
You may remember that some months ago a
gentleman living in holy orders and northern
parts was accused of floggirtg a black girl. Re-
port said, in the rev.’s- favor, that the
girl 'had given back-talk to his wife, and
that, though there had - been a walloping, it
was of only an impressionistic character, a
poor understudy of the real thing—or thong.
Be that as it may, “the gentleman with his
haberdashery fastened behind,” as an irreverent
American recently wrote, had to suffer a good
deal of exasperating publicity, and most likely
the balm that came out of a southern State was
well 'deserved and as good as any that was in
Gilead. A man down from sub-tropic latitudes
tells me that a southern lady sent the minister a
cheque for £5OO as a token of her sympathy.
Now, that’s what I call real sympathy—all wool
and a yard wide, five-ply, and the pattern showing
on both sides.
Mrs. K. Long, mother of Miss Nora Long, the
soprano, a vital little spark who has been domi-
ciled in London for more than three years, and
has been studying the big city and its literature
with probably more intensity than her daughter
does her operatic r6les, has taken her degree,
so to speak. She has qualified as guide to
places of interest, distinction or beauty.
Mrs. Long meets parties by appointment
and escorts them whither they will—to the homes
of Shelley and Keats, at Hampstead, or to the
places where they can get a tailor-made or a hat
at prices that won’t mean daylight robbery. The
plucky lady, who is well known to a number of
MaorilandeVs and Australians, abides at 34 High-
street, Hampstead, London, N.W.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne:, November 1, 1910.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Derby Day dressing was duller than it might
have been, mainly because the weather didn’t
seem to know its own mind. The rain descended
gently, and made froeky women weep for the
clothes they had intended to wear. However,
long acquaintance with Flemington has made
even the butterflies wise; nowadays they
invest in a smart wet-weather rig out “in
case.” Even a butterfly looks well in a natty
rubberised garment very short to show its feet,
and a hat of a motor species, wind-defiant and
jaunty. The day made women sporty. They had
to keep moving for warmth, and they circled
about the betting paddock besieging husbands
and other useful race-time men with their half-
crowns. Women always bet in half-crowns. They
club half-crowns until they reach the awful
limit of half a sovereign; then, after much
argument, it is planked on some fretting beast.
Ihe average racing woman will bring the whole
grandstand down with rage if she sees her half-
crown chasing the field up the straight.
Governors and their suites were everywhere. I
saw Dudleys, Carmichaels, Bosanqu*ts and hordes
of silk-hatted aides looking like crows at a
funeral. A superb creature followed the cortege.
I thought he was a foreign potentate until
L noticed him deferentially and humbly waiting
by the plush box. He wore a scarlet cord cross-
ways oyer his manly bosom and gorgeous purple
and white draping. The draping turned out to be
the wraps of vice-royalty, and the cord was only
his henchman’s collar.
The Dudley lady was a charming white cir-
cumstance ; white feathers nodded in a white hat,
and a snowy feather boa gave a soft finish to the
turn-out. 1 lie Carmichael lady’s costume was
of violet. The Bosanquet people brought the
twins. Mrs. (Hon.) Cyril Ward rose like a
tower among the other women ; she even outdid
the tall aides who walled her in with their gleam-
ing high hats.
n/r S Ij P e °P le , were full force. Ruby
Madden-Osborne distributed delighted greetings
to her friends ; her dress was mole color, with
Giggly silk cords, and a marvellous bird sat on
her head. Another of the clan, Mrs. Hope
Osoorne, showed off the prettiness of the Osborne
wives. She had pink roses in her hat. The
crowd hid her other trappings. Mrs. Harry
Boan, whose husband brought Tanami to the
fray, was tailored to the zenith of smartness.
Mrs. Tallis was another smartly-tailored woman,
who defied the wind in a cap-hat with a pert blue
feather. Papa Fink wandered about all day with
a daughter under each arm. (I presume they were
his daughters; the hats were of the extinguisher
variety.)
A lady who always dresses to set Flemington
a-fire tied a cherry ribbon in a huge bow round a
grey-frock waist, with the wings of the bow
pinned to the shoulders. A peach-pink hat
puffed on to her head finished a rather fruity
scheme. Maie Peach-Sydney was tucked snugly
into black velvet, and Mamma Peach put some
green into her black frock.
Mrs. Reggie Clarke-Power appeared in a
weather cloak that fitted like a well-fitting shoe.
Mrs. Frank Clarke—Nina Cotton that was—wore
a Paisley shawl, a real grandmotherly beauty,
and crimson cornelians in her ears.
I caught a glimpse of Mrs. Medlow Burgess,
down from the mountains for a dash of Melbourne
race-time excitement. Edna Armytage had two
Brisbane girls with her in short foulard frocks.
Mrs. Grand Hotel Holden got her complexion
up against lime green—a sour, new color that is
daring wear. A oretty girl shivered in white
with a pale-blue turban. She must have owned
some sort of coat; but she preferred to shiver into
possible pneumonia to show the dress destined for
Derby Day. Dewar Teale brought along his
handsome wife. She wore orange blossoms in her
black dress—a striking mixture. Jim Purves,
walking in proud relief after his exams, (he
passed in all eight branches) had a beaming wife
alongside in a white cloth rig-out. Mrs. Rubber
Edwards was backing Flavian to advantage on
the woman’s whim that his jockey wore her colors
—a few smart black-and-white stripes. Flavian
won, so that dress did its duty.
Four daily editions of the Sydney express have
been bringing people to the Flemington Whirl.
All the taverns in the town are bulging with
people and their boxes. Shakedowns in corridors-
behind screens are luxuries not to be lightly
spoken of. At the Grand, Oliffe, secretary for
iatt.’s, is wandering about with a square black
beard and an eagle eye. Rouse, of Baker and
Rouse, is here with Mrs. Rouse and a remarkably
pretty daughter at the hair-bows stage. Walter
Walsh, president of the Commercial Travellers”
Club, pales into insignificance beside his wife’s
dresses; the lady has a separate and complete:
turn-out for every race day and evening, with a.
vanload or two of hats. Mrs. Fred Walsh is.
along also, with her diamonds and motor. Stuart.
Henderson has brought his handsome dame. The:
plain punters have brought light clothing, return:
tickets, vain hopes and all their cash. I suppose
it is more sensible, after all, to be a peacock and:
look on with all your feathers than a clean-pluckedi
jackdaw of a backer.
The prettiest of Justice Isaacs’s daughters was;
married last Thursday to one of the young Cohens,
of Sydney. The wedding party practically held
up the traffic between the Synagogue and the:
Grand Hotel, where the Isaacs live. The subse-
quent reception was held in the big Spring-street,
hostel. The bride received the guests’ congratu-
lations in a bower of flowers. The “ breakfast
was absorbed in the dining-room (which sounds,
somewhat confusing), and the festivity was held
just about afternoon-tea time—which makes it-
seem more than ever like the meal-times of Alice
in Wonderland. The invited could not all squeeze:
into the reception-room, so they overflowed into
the lounge and surged half-way up the staircase:
which leads heavenward from the hall. Mamma.
Isaacs looked very juvenile in a dress of the.
newest blue, which is a blend of cornflowers andi
turquoise. The bride’s pretty little short dress,
was made a stately gown by a court train, plenti-
fully broidered with pearls, hung from the.
shoulders. Her maids wore Juliet pearl caps and;
carried quaint little posies. The presents made a.
ilazzling display ; but the regiment of detectives,
on guard made one wonder if they would be a joy
forever. The last wealthy- bride (she kept the-
butler up all night watching the treasures) has.
had her share of burglar.
The Alliance Frangaise had its third soiree-
conference last week. It was an extra-luminous,
function. One of the guests was Cugnet, the visit-
ing airman who is at present steering his Bleriot
above quiet corners of this State and making
the acquaintance of our climatic conditions. He
holds the diploma of the Aero Club of France, has
flown as much as the average swallow, and fallen
twice with some force. He looks a good sport, with
particularly straight-glancing eyes and a deter-.
mined chin. In his first fall, he smashed an arm
and a few oddments ; but he flew immediately he
was mended. The second time he got into diffi-
culties, Bleriot himself flew out and rescued him.
The Bleriot machine is like a graceful bird in
flight. Cugnet talked aviation in forcible French,
and showed some thrilling air-racing pictures. The
machines first ran along the course like snipe,
then shot into the air and ascended in circles.
One implement made a false start and skidded
furiously in a cloud of dust until it got a grip of
the ground, when it shot into the blue like a bird.
The pictures showed the airmen in their planes
adjusting them for the start, and gave startling
glimpses of them flashing within a few yards of
the packed grand-stand.
The monoplanes beat the biplanes hands down
for grace and beauty. They look and behave like
birds. The biplanes resemble only empty mil-
liner’s shelves gone mad and sailing away on a
whirlwind. Of course, the big. important-looking
airships are a class in themselves. The pictured
ones looked like imposing, dignified dames or
elderly fish turning superbly with a swish of their
tails.
Waxexcellency Madden, with Pickwickian tufts
to his white hair, appeared to be deeply interested.
Consul Pigeonneau, of France, and his consular
consort held up the front row ; and all the well-
groomed crowd of French-studving Anglais
rustled softly in the background.
Airman Cugnet has a big party with him, in-
cluding a brother, who is the business man,
Monsieur the expert, and other Monsieurs who
are heart, soul and pocket in aviation affairs.
They intend to start a school where gilded sons,
fathers and uncles will learn to steer a machine.
The Saratogas and things, talking amongst
themselves, say that the Dudleys are going to
Ercildoune for Christmas. That means, I sup-
pose, that Lady Sarah Wilson, of Mafeking, will
soon be back in Australia. Ercildoune is one of
the most charming of Wilson’s stations. Melba
used it on one of her visits, and Dudley flew there
in a cloud of dust for a few hours at the time of
Kitchener’s invasion, when Lady Sarah was last
visiting hereabout.
Saw one or two fashionable and sensible women
at Henley. lam afraid, though, that they merely
aimed at being fashionable, and were sensible by
accident. They carried high Empire walking-
sticks. The sloping, grassy banks of the river
were the hardest things imaginable to stand on
for any length of time. Men with sticks had the
best time of the shore parties; they could prop
themselves up and chatter at ease, while unsup-
ported brothers and sisters had to try and look
happy whilst performing balancing feats. The
newest old-fashion of Empire walking-sticks is an
agreeably graceful one, which lends distinction to
any woman who knows how to use it. One very
pretty Sassiety dame has brought back a beautiful
wand from foreign lands. It is of ebony, and is
topped by a real amethyst in the rough, two
inches long, and an agate set in brilliants. The
wielder of the divining rod is fair and smart; so
the trifle is knocking things endways this race-
time.
There was nearly a tragedy of crushed straw-
berries and tea girl at our lifelike imitation of
Henley. The Athenaeum boat—a huge craft with
wing structures like the winch decks of a ship—
became overloaded with humanity when the
rockets were rushing into the heavens. Corners
of those winch decks, among the gum boughs and
the paper roses, were very cosy and desirable;
also the fireworks could be seen beautifully from
their shade; so something like 250 happy souls
and their solid bodies went aloft, and the timbers
began to complain. Officials implored the happy
watchers to come down, but in vain. Then they
threatened ; but the foolish people were comfort-
able and couldn’t understand the necessity for a
move; so the timbers went on complaining. A
company of the Chicago tea-room girls were sta-
tioned on the deck below, and as it was impossible
to get out owing to the crowd, they started to say
their prayers right there amid the strawberries
and the tea-urns. Then the officials took strong
measures—l forget what they were for the minute
—and the elevated unwise were hurried off their
groaning perch. After a brief, hair-straightening
interval, the Chicago girls closed down on their
religious devotions, and all was gaiety and rockets
and strawberries once more.
The manager of the visiting S’African cricket
team is a scion of the Nicholas Fitzgerald family.
One brother, Mr. “Ted” Fitzgerald, is Mel-
bourne’s most decorative bachelor; another,
“Mat,” is also decorative and a cricketer of note.
A third is in the 11th Hussars, the regiment from
which Captain Rome A.D.C. has temporary leave,
and is among the Cold Land’s most skilful polo-
players.
Rumor will have it that the successful petitioner
in a very swell case is off to London to re-marry
his beautiful divorcee.
Mrs. Continental-tyre Edwards, just back from
amongst the airmen, did not fly in an aeroplane,
but she was a passenger in an airship. The differ-
ence is so great, she says. Mammoth animal
though the airship is, it is not so impressive as an
aeroplane. Her particular fortune in airships was
the latest Zeppelin “Z.L.”—the quite new one.
It occupies a house like the Melbourne Exhibition
Building; a snapshot of a “bit of the door”
makes one think of the mouth of a dragon’s cave.
The thing takes dozens of men hanging on to
grappling ropes to bring it to tether.
Though this airship is so bulky, when it is on its
good behavior it answers to a touch as obediently
as the most up-to-date motor-car. It turns with
the dignity and grace of a scornful lady sweeping
her tail around with superb disdain. Under the
great cigar or sausage that makes the bulk of an
airship hang three round boats—“gondells” they
call them—suspended on aluminium wires. In
the centre one sit the passengers. In one sits the
■captain and in the other the engineers. The passen-
gers “gondell” is tucked higher up than the
others. And there they snuggle like baby-
kangaroo in the mother-kangaroo’s pouch.
The pretty little Parker girl, of Williamstown,
sister-in-law of Mrs. Yiv Parker, is to be mar-
ried in a week or two to Dr. “Chuck” Dane.
The doctor, who owns a rich Dublin accent, has
boughtapracticein Ballarat, wheretheSouth-street
•competitions are the only serious trouble. Balla-
rat is a horribly healthy place for a medico to
seize upon ; but I suppose someone gets a relaxed
throat now and then.
Dr. Godfrey and his bride came back from the
honeymoon just . in time for the - Flemingtoir
frivols. On Derby day Mrs. Godfrey smilingly
trailed a beautiful frock across the lawn.
“Railways” Tait tore himself from his work
■on a recent busy day and attended the christening
■of a new motor-ambulance in the Town Hall. It
was so thoughtful of him.
The most Kaiser-Wilhelmic moustache in Mel-
bourne has been shorn of its arrogant extrem-
ities. Handsome John Jacobs took an honest
pride in the adornment, until he saw himself as a
snapshot subject in a weekly paper. Ha had
\worn the hair the races or somewhere, and the
wind was whistling through it when the photo-
grapher did the trick. The result was a portrait
in which the moustache looked even mightier
than the man. Its appearance in print appalled
the modest merchant, and soon afterwards he cut
it down to a commonplace length.
The sad death of printer Stephens was a sudden
blow to his people and friends. He got a chill in
one of the recent hurricane changes, developed
pneumonia and was dead in two days. Two
doctor sons and two other Collins-street doctors
worked hard on his case, but everything was
hopeless.
The New Girl in “ Tom Jones ” is singing more
charmingly than ever now that she has the
“pitch” of the theatre. Visiting Tasmanians
and Adelaideans and Sydneysiders, also Maori-
landers, are thronging the theatre, and giving
“Tom Jones” and his adopted people a fresh
boost for the sixth week. The New Girl’s husband
sits every night in the far corner of the south box
and worships the Voice and the Girl. He glances
round proudly at times to see the effect of a
special trill on the stalls.
“ The Whip ” scored on Derby night by having
the Oaklands Hunt Club—real live huntsmen —in
the red-coated supper scene. And you couldn’t
have told them from real live actors.
I thought the charities would have been given a
rest during the Cup gaieties after the run they
had on the public purse all the winter; but
here comes another looking about for backsheesh.
It is to be a bazaar without gambling ! The first
and second engineers are the Madden lady and
Mrs. Earle—two of our most consistent race-
goers. Possibly the bazaar is meant as a penance.
It is to occur about November 17, after the last
favorite has been beaten, and its deserving object
is the Collingwood Creche.
Woman is coming along nicely, thank you. The
Political Labor people in Melbourne spent Derby
Day holding a special conference to consider the
case of a sinner who, besides being a Laborite,
was a member also of the Commonwealth Protec-
tion Association ; and out of the 170 or so dele-
gates Miss Mulcahy was chosen minute secre-
tary. Anybody who has tried to keep the official
record of a meeting of 170 of ten-angry men knows
that there are pitfalls on that track; but the feather
in Miss Mulcahy’s impressive chapeau never once
looked like moulting. In the end, by the way,
the Labor M.P. who was the cause of all the con-
ferring, resigned from the wicked Protectionist
Association.
From “ Rosna,” of Adelaide :
The Bosanquets, with the twins and some aides, are at
the Gup. The night before departing they banquetted the
visiting Dutchmen, other guests being portions of Parlia-
ment, some navy and a smattering of pretty girl to roll
the conversation ball.
The Mayoral Cohens’ garden revel at Victoria Park was
disfigured somewhat by polar weather, notwithstanding
which the women turned out in force and their best
frocks, and even that scarce product, Man, was occasion-
ally visible in the throng. Mrs. Cohen, in black, wel-
comed a pearl-grey Excellency and two white-muslin
Excellencettes. The smiling Dutchmen were there in
battalions. All the afternoon daylight-fireworks sent
pink elephants and green clowns and such meandering
overhead, and one rocket exploded a Union Jack, which,
with a leaning towards the fitness of things, fell and
clasped an aide-de-camp round the neck.
Revels have been very fleet this week—Dutch fleet.
Every known form of entertainment was thrust at the
visitors, who bore it all manfully. On Friday Commo-
dore van Voss gave a return revel on the Hertog Hen-
drik, which craft was encased in fern and floriculture and
electric lights. The Ministry and its wife, segments of
the Civil Service and their better halves, wandering
municipalities, and furlongs of girl trudged through
mud and rain and Port Adelaide to be there. There was
a band, and an afternoon-tea that was purelv boshter—
no mere drawing-room term will fit—arid nearly even
maiden carried off a trophy of the chase.
Carreno ran ashore from the Wilcannia, put on black
velvet with lace accoutrements, and played in the Town
Hall on Tuesday eve. An audience, large in bulk, con-
siderable in tonnage, and positively bursting with culture
came to hear her. Roses were laid at her feet in barrow-
loads, and another large assortment accompanied the
farewell tears at the train and boat on Thursday.
Miss Hawkins, who was an intimate friend of the late
Catherine Helen Spence, organised a party to the inmates
of “ the Destitute ” on Saturday, to celebrate the birth
day of that one-time good citizen and friend of the insti-
tution, and the first woman on its Board. This treat, the
result of a memorial subscription, is the onlv thing that
has been done to keep South Australia’s most notable
woman in remembrance. There has been some talk of
rebuilding the Destitute, but talking about memorials is
one of Adelaide’s strong points.
A rose show occurred in the Town Hall on Wednesday.
The Governor’s party and various proud persons, leadin’"
defenceless Dutchmen, battled for breathing space
among the blooms. One of the übiquitous Ind family
took the prize for the most celestial table decorations
The Liberal Union, having finished its dark plans "for
teaching our sex to cast its vote upon the waters, has
spent the week in giving and receiving parties—millions
of parties. Tea was offered to the visitors in gallons
every afternoon until the Friday on which the pro-
gramme had delicately stated “ Delegates leave
Adelaide.” In the mornings the delegates warmed-
up the tea urn in return revels, the last being
a gay Victorian shivoo on Thursday, when no
less than 54 hostesses saw to the pressing needs
of 48 guests in a rose-clad atmosphere. On this
occasion some complimentary statements were made
and a presentation handed to the Adelaide secretary
Muriel Farr. ' ’
The disciples of Orpheus (deceased) took their lutes
into the Town Hall on Thursday evening'lor the ninety-
first time in succession. Laura Humphreys and Clara
Cocking were the soloists on this occasion.
Which reminds me that Dolores will be here soon.
The S’Afriean cricketers are the latest applicants for
entertainment. The Commonwealth cast them on the
Outer Harbor one day last week, and we have lent them
the ’Varsity Oval wherein tofind their land legs.
The Home for Incurables committee is out seeking the
pincushion and the shaving tidy for the annual fete due
in the middle of this month.
Ex-Senator Downer, with his wife and their new baby
are to go to England next year to help the King put on
his crown.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.
Alarming cable from Spain :
Lisbon, Monday Afternoon.
The Portuguese Embassy at the Vatican has been
reduced to a legation.
Another revolution, and they’ll make it a registry
office.
The Sydney Telegraph fell in rather
badly last week. When Minister Griffith pro-
posed that the Government should supply its
Public Works Department with bricks from its
own brickwork, that paper arose, with the usual
air of regret for the ignorance of Labor people, to
explain that there was mighty little profit ih the
business, after all. Then someone wrote drawing
attention to the prospectus of a new brickmaking
co. in its own columns —a prospectus which
whooped greatly, and put down the net profit to
be earned at an easy 38 per cent, on the capital.
And after that there was a silence like that of the
worm in the grave.

CONSTIPATION OVERCOME
By Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills.
Constipation brings many ailments in its train,
and is the primary cause of almost all sickness.
Keep your bowels open regularly and your blood
pure and you will escape many of the ailments to
which women are subject. If you suffer from
constipation, the following letter will interest
you :
“I was a sufferer from constipation and its
train of evils—dizziness, languor, headaches and

time,” writes Mrs. Julia
Bateman, 391 Pyrmont
Street. Ultimo, “and
found much trouble in over-
coming the ailment.
Having used purgative
medicines without any last-
ing benefit, I was per-
suaded to try Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills, and
after one dose I was won-
derfully relieved. I con-
tinued their use, taking
them on alternate nights,
and my bowels were re-
stored to a normal and
regular condition, and in
consequence I lost all those dreadful sensations
of dizziness and depression. I always keep the
pills in the home, and can recommend them as an
invaluable medicine for women.”*

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Office Fanatic was being- watched anxiously,
as by some occult means he always gets a good tip about
24 hours before the Melbourne Gup is run. When Blue
Spec won he was annoyed all day by the row of a pea-
cock in the bird-shop, two doors away, and about 3 p.m.
suddenly recognised it as a tip. Hastily scanning the
list of acceptors, he looked vainly for something con-
nected with a peacock, and then a heavenly light
suffused his anxious countenance. “ Blue Spec is the
only thing I can see,” he said. “That peacock is mak-
ing a ghastly row, and it has blue specks in its tail. Mine
goes on the neddie.” Then the staff made a break to get
on first, and sure enough Blue Spec landed the bacon.
This year he noticed there were 39 acceptances, 13 more
than’laßt year. The 13th horse on the list was Artillerie,
and the brute’s weight was 7st. 131 b. The last that was seen
of him that day was a glimpse of a hurried figure sidling
into a pawnshop with a camera under his arm. When
he emerged he was without the camera, and he hoisted
himself on to a Pit.t-street tram and departed in the
direction where Patrick Noses is to be found. But this
time the Fates deceived him, the precious influence of
the mysterious 13 was absent. For Comedy King won,
Trafalgar ran into second place, and Apple Pie was third
All these tips are vanity, and there is no money in them"

Interesting to know how much flesh was
“ wasted” within the past week by the crowd of jockeys
who rode in the Cup. Wonderful feats of weight-losing
are accomplished by some of the mannikins, if their
employers are as foolish as themselves. Eight pounds in
two days is quite ordinary. In the more extreme cases,
the victims sometimes reduce themselves to a frank
confession of helplessness. The other week a Melbourne
Jockey “ took off ” 161 b. in 40 hours, and when he arrived
at the racecourse he hadn’t the strength to attempt to
take the mount he had been sweating for.
* * * *
“Dadlum ” : The bumping and bustling at the
turns, the struggle up the straight, the final effort near
the post, are not to my mind the inost strenuous features
of Cup day. Rather, I nominate the hard-fought battle
for beer that rages round the small iron shed on the Flat.
The Hill is honeycombed with bars wherein a man may
take his drink in comfort, no matter how big the crowd ;
and “ inside” you can’t go wrong. But on the Flat “the
going ” is bad, and the course utterly inadequat e to carry'
the fields that surge along it. The track slopes sharply
to the winning-post—the bar, I mean ; and here the most
Stirring events of the meeting take place. On Cup day 7
last year, a Wowser, nosing round for Horrible Examples,
ventured too close to the surging mob. He was sucked
helpless into the vortex, and whirled hither and thither.
After much buffeting he found himself w'edged tight
against the dripping counters. “ Socking another bloke’s
beer’’and “ closing on the change” were the main charges
levelled at him. His life was threatened. The horses
were at the post for the Yan Yean Stakes when tw'o
Johns rescued him. The committee of his church sent
him out for life a week later, the smell of stale beer
completely satisfying the ecclesiastical stewards as to his
guilt. Some hot day I shouldn’t be surprised if the
pressure of frantic alcohol-fanciers caused the whole of
this “joint” to slip its moorings and move across the
straight, taking the judge with it. In that event, no-
thing could prevent it crossing the lawn and perhaps
entering the Governor’s box. If a silk hat gets damaged
in the turmoil, I hold that an action would lie against
the V.R.C.
* * * *
One of the visitors expected for this year’s Oup
was “ Billy ” Jones, formerly 7 of Ballarat, whose Bravo
beat Carbine in 1899, after losing the Caulfield Cup under
historical circumstances. The genial “ Billy ” had already 7
gone to England when Bravo pulled off the Cup for him,
and his popular colors (black and yellow' diamonds) were
not much seen in Australia subsequently. Of late years
he has been heard of as winning races in England, and
when he took the valuable Oaks Stakes with his filly Airs
and Graces, his good nature was anecdoted. Charlotte
Hemming, the Melbourne recitress, had come to England
at that time, after losing all her belongings in the scan-
dalous wreck of the China. Jones, as an old friend of her
father, had a warm welcome for Miss Hemming, and
when she was staying with the family he laid her £lOO to
a penny against Airs and Graces for the Oaks.
* * * *
When the Maoriland performances of Lady
Lucy were looked up in Miller’s Sporting Pamphlet,
punters, without knowing anything of the Maoriland
conditions, reckoned that she was about the best handi-
capped of all the acceptors for the Melbourne Cup. As a
four-year-old she won the Maoriland Cup, two miles, in
good time. The mare’s weight was only 7st. lib. for the
big at Canterbury, and the next placed horses
were each giving her 81b. ; but, considering that she
proved her stamina by winning, Lady Lucy on her four
year-old form seemed very kindly treated in the Mel-
bourne Cup at 7st. 121 b. Many horses improve consider-
ably in their fifth year. Carbine was a five-year-old
when he won his memorable Melbourne Cup with lOst. 51b.
up, whereas he had failed with lOst. the year previous,
when, for a while, he was rather off color.
# * * *
An attempt was made to rig the scales at San-
down Park (Vic.) on the Wednesday before the Cup. The
scales are on a movable platform in the weighing-room,
and some evil-disposed person had sawn out a 3ft. by 2ft.
slab of the floor, and had nailed the platform over the
hole, presumably' with intent to manipulate the mechan-
ism at the psychological moment. But the scheme
failed, and the detectives have been looking round ever
since. Heaven knows why anyone should go to so much
trouble when it is easier to manipulate jockeys. The
silly idea is not new either, having been tried at Rand-
wick, Newcastle and Flemington. Since the Flemington
plot, on the day of Revenue’s Cup, the Y.R.C.’s scales-
stand on an iron plate resting on a thick concrete slab.

The result of the V.R.C. Derby was the first
severe blow to their prognostications that the punting
public received last Saturday. Victory' for Beverage
didn’t seem impossible, considering the good looks of the-
Malster colt—the crack two-year-old of last season —and
the improvement he had shown in his training work of
late ; but the all-round reversal of the Sydney Derby form
was a staggerer. No difference in weights or distance of
race can be pleaded in explanation of the following
figures:—
Sydney Derby Melbourne Derby
(Run Oct. 1). (Run Oct. 29).
Tanami ..Ist .. .. 9th
Bobadea .. 2nd .. .. 3rd
Beverage .. 3rd .. .. Ist
Lager .. 4th .. .. sth
Styria .. 6th .. .. 2nd
The Derby was expected to produce a legitimate public
fancy for the Melbourne Cup, but here was a result which
left the public with no three-year-old fancy whatever.
Both Beverage and Styria had been scratched for the Cup—
the former because he had not been prepared for a long
tussle, and is, moreover, a one-eyed colt that cannot
he expected to see his way through a big field ;
and the latter because she was reckoned to
have no chance against her stable companion Flavinius-
at the Cup weights. Yet Styria, on appearances, was
the only start er for the Derby that one would confidently
pick to stay two miles, and she ran more like a Cup horse
than any of the others. Unfortunately, the filly is
unsound in front, and after the race she favored one of
her forelegs in a way which suggested that she might
have to be withdrawn from the Oaks on Thursday. If she-
comes to the post in sufficiently sound condition Styria
should win the Oaks easily enough.
The Derby race was the more unsatisfactory in
the fact that the favorite, Tanami, was palpably stopping
behind from choice. The form didn’t show Tanami to
have no chance for the Cup, but it proved him to be a
sulky fellow, quite likely to run last all the way. Boba-
dea, on the other hand, seemed to run honestly enough,
but to be short of a gallop or two. Still, of all the Sydney
and Melb. Derby horses left in the Cup he had the best-
claim to consideration, seeing that he shaped respectably
in both of the classic events.
The Melbourne Stakes gave the public its
second great biff. Punters hoped for an undeniable tip
from the Stakes, and all they got was the easy victory of
Son of the Marsh, followed by Artillerie, the two out-
siders of the party. The winner, it was admitted, might
run away with the race, seeing that in the Spring Stakes
(12 furlongs), run at Randwick on Derby Day, the Eng-
lish horse led the field for 10 furlongs. It was the
Spring Stakes that Comedy King won from Prince Foote,
Pendil, Trafalgar and Parsee, after the speedy Son of the
Marsh had dropped out of it. But how about Artillerie ?
What had she ever done to justify a hope that she could
beat a number of the best horses in Australia—such as
they are—over l£-miles at weight for age? The runner-
up for the Melbourne Stakes is proverbially a dangerous
candidate for the Cup, therefore Artillerie (7st. 131 b.) was
suddenly presented as a good thing for the Cup on paper,
whilst Comedy King and Flavinius were put out of favor ;
and Trafalgar, although he finished third, and was seen
tabe somewhat blocked in his final run, came short of
expectations. One could have forgiven Trafalgar for
being beaten by Parsee, Comedy King, or the unaccount-
able Alawa. But to finish behind Artillerie ! Punters
could only console themselves with the reflection that
Artillerie is said to be incapable of battling in a big bump-
some field. They still fancied Trafalgar, but were pre-
pared to see him beaten by two or three of the mere
handicap horses in the Cup field.
* * * *
Flavian, by winning the Hotham IHandicap (1£
miles) in plucky style and pretty fast time, improved on
his running in the Coongy Handicap at Caulfield, where
the son of Flavus ran a close second to Eye Glass, and
was a trifle ahead of Artillerie, who, however, was giv-
ing him 2st. in that event. After Artillerie had run so-
surprisingly well in the Stakes, people remembered that
the Coongy form has often had much significance, andi
the Cup chance of Flavian was seriously discussed in
preference to Matouree’s.
* * * *
James Wilson, jun., seems to have a very smart
colt in Philio, the Maribvrnong Plate winner. The colt is
bigger than the average precocious youngster, and his
manner of beating Popinjay at the finish, with the rest
of the field dropping away from the leaders, was the
manner that impresses beholders. The surprise of the
Maribyrnong betting was the strong favoritism of YVool-
erina, whose previous performances had given no reason
for it to be tipped so freely.
* * * *
The difference between English and Australian
handicapping conditions is illustrated in the remarkable
case of two gees—Christmas Daisy and Mustapha—that
ran first and second respectively in the Cambridgeshire
Stakes two years in succession. The “ Cambridgeshire ”■
is reckoned the biggest betting event of the year in Eng-
land, and only a good horse can win it or nearly win it.
Yet the last year’s winner and runner-up were carrying
only 7st. 21b. and 7st. 4lb. when they repeated their
performances.
The drawer of Flnvinius in Tattersall’s big
Caulfield Sweep this year was a Custom-house clerk in
the S3 - dney branch of one of the inter-State steamship
offices.

Big cricket started at Adelaide on Saturday,
where Victoria and South Aus. met. Clem Hill won the
toss for South Oss, and gave Victoria the strike. It was
a disastrous innings. Warne was caught off the second
ball, Hansford was run out, Smith was caught and so was
Kortlang. Four wickets for six runs ! Armstrong came
to stem the rot and doubled the score in no time,
then lost his partner, McAlister. Delves came, started to
hit out, and quickly went. Even Armstrong only man-
aged to accumulate 35. Hazlitt smacked up 30 and was
caught, and Laver fell to Whitty. All out for 111 —a
most miserable display. Crawford had taken five for 42,
and bowled four maidens in 15 overs. Whitty bowled four
maidens in 17 overs, and took four for 41. South Aus.
made a better showing, although Campbell and Whitty
vanished for six between them, and by the end of the
afternoon had accumulated 135 for eight wickets. On
Monday the wicket had improved; so South Aus. lifted
its total to 220, Crawford carrying his hat for 79. Then
Victoria started a rapid recovery. Warne opened for 18,
D. Smith dashed 96 on to the scoring-hoard, Ransford
made 71, and Armstrong put up a modest 27. At the
end of the play Kortlang shouldered his bat for 30, a
total of 250 for four wickets.
* * * *
The marvellous recovery did not continue on
Tuesday, however, Kenny, Laver and Carkeek being dis-
missed without breaking the egg, and the innings ended
for 305. At time of writing, South Australia was back at
the sticks, and had lost two wickets for eight runs, w hich
isn't a good start on the journey after the necessary 195.
•* * * *
In Sydney the third round of First Grade came
to an end with a victory for the bowlers. The highest
score for the day was the not-out 79 of Kemmis, of
Balmain, made in a second innings which did not count.
Johnson of Gordon made 69, Mary Ann Noble carried his
bat for 61 for Paddington, and H. Cranney notched 64 for
Central Cumberland. The bowlers put up some pretty
figures. Watson, of Glebe, took three Balmain wickets
for four, and Christie took five of the same side’s for 15 ;
Macartney, of Gordon, took five Waverley wickets for 24 ;
Sale, of Paddington, got away with four of Middle Har-
bor’s for 23 ; and Docker, of Burwood, four of Sydney’s
for 31. There were others, but these were the cream.
Glebe, which had declared with eight down for
318, beat Balmain by 256 on the first innings. Gordon
topped the day with its victory over Waverley by au
innings and 45 runs—a most fearful doing. University
made 195 in the first innings ; and Central Cumberland
responded with 133. University then declared with
four wickets dow'n for 118, and Central Cum-
berland lost two for 86; so University won
by 62 on the first innings. Petersham beat North Sydney
by the narrow' margin of two runs on the first innings,
and Paddington downed Middle Harbor by 87 on the first
innings. An interesting struggle was that between Bur-
wood and Sydney. Burwood, which made only 88 in the
firstinnings, managed to heave Sydney out for 37, and
then declared with four wickets for 106. Sydney failed
miserably, and made only 66 in the second attempt, and
the amazed Burwood found itself on top with an outright
win by six wickets and 91 runs.

The South African cricketers who arrived in
Adelaide last week, found themselves in a strange country
from a cricket standpoint. Having acquired the use of
their legs, they commenced practice, but found the grass
a deadly thing' to play on. Seems that in S’Africa they
use concrete and matting wickets. And they have not
much time to get used to the strange green sward either,
as they open against S.A. this week. But probably
they will have settled down to it by the time they leave
Adelaide in quest of gold and glory.
* * * *
Melbourne cricketers, last Saturday, showed
little inclination to revel with the bat. Vaughan, of
Melbourne, made 99 in a sprightly manner ; but no other
man approached his total. It was a day when wickets
had a tendency to fall like grass before the scythe.
East Melbourne achieved the brightest success by wal-
loping University by an innings and 62 runs. P’ran
defeated Richmond by 176, and Melbourne conquered
Collingwood by 157. Essendon, which played with the
greatest solemnity, snatched a victory over North by 32
runs; and Carlton, which just failed to secure a one-innings
win, surpassed the South Melbourne gentlemen by 129.
The surprise of the day was Northcote’s spirited licking
of St. Kilda (last season’s premiers) by two sticks and 130
runs 1

Sammy Jones, the old-time Australian cricketer,
is now settled down as coach in Auckland (M.L.). He

Twenty-four runners took part in a Westralian
Anniversary Day Marathon race last week. The event
was over the full distance of 26 miles 385yds. Winner
turned up in Leslie Hough, of Collie, who finished a
quarter-mile ahead of the second man. Time, 2hrs. 54min.,
which smashes Andy Sime’s (N.S.W.) Australasian record
(amateur) of 2hrs. 54min 30sec., established at Newaown
last June. The Westralian long-distance ped. also won a
twenty-sixer held at the Fire Brigades’ sports this year,
the watches making him do 3hr. smin. 34 3-ssec. for the
journey.

As a result of “test” races last week, H. W.

The Vic. Public Schools championship sports,
at Melbourne Cricket Ground, saw five records lowered.
L. H. Kejly (Wesley College) cleared 6ft. in the high
jump, thus establishing a public schools’ record, a
record for Victorian athletics, and equalling Eric Russell’s
Australasian record. The Wesley jumper essayed to
smash Russell’s 6ft., but tipped the pole at 6ft. 2in.
This is probably a world’s record for public schools. The
best Fogland figure is sfr. Bin. Other record-smashings
were for youngsters (under 16 and the like), except that
R. Watson (Grammar School) established a new record
for the half-mile (2min. ssec.). Wesley practically
scooped the pool for the challenge cup with 144 points,
scoring 10 firsts, five seconds, out of 19 events—a bril-
liant performance. Scotch College (84£ points), Mel-
bourne Grammar (60 points), Xavier (39 points), Gee-
long (35 points), Geelong Grammar (28J points), finished
that way.

The French military authorities made exhaus-
tive tests with regard to the value of the aeroplane in
war during recent manmuvres, and proved it useful for
scouting and dispatch-carrying. But it was found that
a good rifleman on a motor-bike is a match for the man
■on the flying-machine. Aeroplanes were followed by men
on horseback, in motor-cars and on motor-bikes. The
motor-bike seemed able to hold the aero all the time;
and when, as a final test, half a dozen machines were let
loose without drivers, the motor-rifleman accounted for
four of them.

At the present time Australia is buying from
overseas makers, roughty, 1000 motor-cars per annum.
First-class Australian-made cars are to be seen occa-
sionally on our roads, and they have proved themselves
among the best in the world ; but at present there is no
Australian car-making industry, and there is not likely
to be one till the imported chassis is removed from its
place on the free list. In any case, owing to t'e
operation of the patent laws, many of the parts
of Australian-made cars will have to be im-
ported, but there is no reason why the parts
not protected by patent rights should not.be made up in
our own continent. At the very least 1000 cars per
annum means £350,000 drained out of Australia, and the
circulation of that big sum here would come in very
handy. With the advent of the car for traction and pas-
senger traffic in place of the lorry and the cab, the in-
creased demand should make it worth while the Fisher
Government considering if something cannot be done to
create an Australian motor-vehicle industry.
Announced that D. Hall, of Victoria, will try
and chip something off the Melbourne-Sydney bike
record. He will be paced by a motor-bike, and followed
by a motor-car, which will convey an official supervisor
and also provisions. The lamps of the car will also make
the night riding safer, easier and faster. Pearson’s
record of 49 hours for the 575 miles will take some beat-
ing ; but Hall’s preparations have a business-like look
about them, which indicate that the young man is
thorough.

A German, with a name like a bad attack of
catarrh, stowed away on one of the German sky-liners
flying between Berlin and Diisseldorf, and was promptly
hailed as the first aerial stowaway, even by Australian
papers. This is deplorable. The honor of being the
first aerial stowaway belongs to an Australian, who hid
himself on board a dirigible at San Francisco. The ship
came to grief, and the Australian stowaway was among
the injured. This country seems to have a knack of
getting in the front in every department of human
activity. ,
The wrestle for the Challenge Cup (adjourned
from Henley day) was quietly discussed on the Yarra last
week. The two contestants were University and Albert
Park, and the former won the drinking-vessel by about a
length. The result, which caused some pleasant excite-
ment, probably surprised the losers more than it did the
winners. The Park crew, with the veteran J. Donald as
stroke, was an alleged champion collection eclipsing the
students in weight and experience.

Rowing is a family matter up North. At the
recent regatta at Maryborough (Queensland), a crew of
four brothers named McDowell was just beaten in the
race for the champion fours of Queensland. A few years
back the four brothers Sullivan won the event, and then-
keenest rivals were the four brothers Anderson.

The Papke-Ed Williams collision of last week
at the Sydney Stadium was as dull a spectacle as one
could wish to avoid. About 6000 turned out to see it;
but it would have been hard to find a satisfied half-dozen
at the finish. It was announced that “ Papke gives his
weight as list. 61b.” He certainly looked to have more
than 21b. the advantage of Williams (list. 41b.). The
latter was palpably nervous when he commenced; and
he didn’t accumulate confidence as the fight pro-
gressed. He had to do most of the leading; but
his punches hardly seemed to irritate the placid
man from the U.S., who walked straight in, al-
lowed Williams to embrace him, and then shot
vicious little uppercuts at the Victorian’schin, and mostly
missed. The end came in the sixth round with a punch
in the stomach which interested nobody except Williams.
He sagged to the floor, and reposed there till “ Eight! ’’
was called by referee “ Snowy ” Baker. Then the towel
arrived—to the relief of everyone, for the night had
turned cold.
* # * *
Hock Keys, Sydney’s best handicraftsman in
the roped ring at the lightweight limit, pulled himself
together for another battle in Melbourne the other night,
after being long submerged ; and, although not as fit as
a violin, demonstrated his superiority over the local
State champion, Jim Armstrong, in a 20-round mill.
Keys is no slaughterman, but at his top has no equal
here, and probably few elsewhere, as a point to point
fighter. He ramrodded that piston-left of his into Arm-
strong’s features with wearying monotony, and threw in
occasional dazzling spells of two-handed juggling that
made the Cup-time crowd whoop joyously. Armstrong
wore well, and was fresh as daisies at the finish, but he
had been out-pointed in all the elements of ring milling.
Keys the winner.

The committee of the new (?) Amateur Sports
Grounds at Melbourne (Vic.) is worrying over how to
renovate the dilapidated fixings. The stand is anything
but attractive, while the dressing-rooms below call for
either thorough fumigation or a charge of dynamite.
The Vic. Amateur Athletic Association contemplates
regular monthly sports meetings, the first next Saturday,
when champions such as George Blake, “ Dad ” Wheatley
and Vic Aitken are expected to fly through space.

“Texas”: Given good weather, which can
hardly be dodged, that motor ride, Perth to Adelaide
(B. 11/8/TO), should resolve itself into an ideal picnic. I
have been over the route from Fowler’s Bay to Cool-
gardie—am, in fact, on the track again now—and I don’t
do a single shudder when I think of it. From Perth to
Coolgardie, the railway having put the teams out of busi-
ness, there is good firm riding. H. W. Padfield, of Oool-
gardie, left Norseman at noon on a motor bike, went to
his home, spruced up and was talking to me in Bayley-
street, at 7 p.m.—114 miles, 6£ hours—and that was when
the roads were subject to heavy traffic. So that
stage is all right. Norseman to White Well (S.A.), 140
miles east of Eucla, is really better for rubber tyres than
a macadamised road. Except for one sandbar two miles
long, and the half-mile down the cliffs at Madura and up
again at Eucla, the road is smooth level clay, lightly-
timbered with low mulga, saltbush, etc. Some sharp
curves are the only drags on speed. This stretch includes
the dreaded Eyre’s sand-patch, which is avoided by an
easily-found, well-defined and well-watered back track of
about equal length. At Whitewell comes the change
which gives the route a bad name. Of the first 42 miles
25 are heavy mallee sand in which coach wheels sink two
and three inches over the felloes; they include some long,
heavy hills which will thoroughly test the utility of the
mats. During most of the year this part is also
cursed with a plague of miscalled “ March ” flies.
After this stretch there are a few isolated sandhills, in
gradually decreasing numbers, for another 30 miles ;
then good roads till nearing Yardea, where another sand
stretch of 25 miles intrudes. Between Yardea and Port
Augusta there is another 26-mile sandbar, but this has
already been twice traversed by motor-car, and should
be no obstacle to a machine specially designed for over-
landing. The road is well watered throughout (it is a
surveyed stock route), the longest gaps between drinks
being 40 miles on the W. A. side and 15 to 20 in S. Aus.
It would be madness to attempt the transcontinental
survey route,, which is unwatered, and traverses hundreds
of miies of sand and spinifex.

BOTTLE-PRACTICE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
H.U.S. Powerful made an unexpected return to Sydney
this morning. This was due to an Admiralty order
directing; that a new type of ammunition should be used
for trial during; the forthcoming- bottle practice. The
new shell was taken aboard, and the flagship sailed for
Melbourne this morning. —News item.
It is clearly just an error of the printer—he’s a terror,
For he alters things completely with no single word of
warning;
“ Battle-practice,” said the “ copy,” but the screed was
blurred and sloppy—
And the flagship sails for Melbourne in the morning!
When November days are nearing, ho! the gallant
captain’s steering,
Ho ! the ships and navigators all the ocean’s dangers
scorning;
Loaded up with ammunition, wave the corkscrews with
precision,
For the flagship sails for Melbourne in the morning !
See 1 the Pah’f’l hoists her anchor—is it grim, rebellious
canker,
Are there riots by the Yarra, filling nights and days with
thorning?
Has the Hupper ’Ouse exploded ? See ! the Pah’f’l’s guns
are loaded,
And the flagship sails for Melbourne in the morning 1
’Tis the Cup, methinks, approaching— hence the sailing
and the coaching,
Hence the special staffs of waiters and the dresses new
adorning;
Spick and span from snip and barber, so they’re leaving
Sydney Harbor—
Yea, the flagship sails for Melbourne in the morning !
We have mentioned bottle-practice—whisper low, for such
the fact is.
And the “special shell ” is ready—Byron Moore has given
warning;
Clear the decks for evening parties—wave the corkscrew
there, my hearties,
For the Pah'fl sails for Melbourne in the morning !

WE want to inaugurate
a new movement in
buying : protective
boot and shoe buying . The
term “protective” is neces-
sitated through the same
conditions which made it
necessary for our government
to pass pure food and other
similar laws. It is necessary
because of the wide-spread
adulteration, substitution and
cheap imitations with which
the people who buy in good
faith are often defrauded.
To overcome this with entire
protection to our customers,
we have inaugurated the plan
of having every pair of shoes
made by us carry the trade
mark “ Marshall,” by which
they are distinguished , and
established, and standard-
ized, for their quality and
merit, and through which they
are immediately recognizable.
This name is registered in the
Government Patent Office, but
what is more important, it is
registered at large with the
buying public through adver-
tising.
The word “Marshall”
means “Shoes” just as clearly
as the letters S-h-6-e and it
also means a great deal more.
It means a certain kind of shoe,
manufactured in such high
quality for so many years that
it has become standardized
as a shoe of the very highest
class, upon whose wearing
qualities, fit and appearance
you can rely.
There can be no question of
the value of trade mark buying
as a policy—the buying .of
trade-marked articles, which
have been standardized through
advertising, is worthy of your
fullest trust. It would be the
greatest possible protection to
the buying public if they
confined all their buying to
trade-marked articles ; and we
want y our views on the sub-
ject We want your side of
the question ; the best argu-
ment you can put up in
favor of such a method of
buying. %
This is our offer :—we will
give a prize of ,£lO for the
best two-hundred (200) word
argument, giving the best
reasons you can think of in
favor of buying trade-marked
articles. Give what you con-
sider the greatest advantages
in so doing, according to your
experience in buying the
various articles you have
purchased from time to time.
For the best argument we
will pay ;£lO. The article
must not contain more than
two-hundred (200) words, and
must reach our office by sth
day of December, 1910.

FROOTOIDS
Cure Headache, Indigestion, Constipa-
tion, and Biliousness. They are elegant
in appearance and pleasant to take;
they are immensely more valuable than
an ordinary aperient; they remove from
the blood, tissues, and internal organs,
waste poisonous matter that is clogging
them and choking the channels that lead
to and from them. Frootoids are
THE BEST
aperient medicine to take when any
Congestion or Blood Poison is present,
or when Congestion of the Brain or
Apoplexy is present or threatening. They
have been tested, and have been proved
to afford quick relief in such cases when
other aperients have not done any good
at all. Frootoids are absolutely un-
rivalled for
FAMILY
use ; their beneficial effects are evident
by the disappearance of headache —a
bright cheery sense of perfect health
taking the place of sluggish depressed
feelings, by the liver acting properly, and
by the food being properly digested.
Frootoids are a very economical
MEDICINE.
A dose taken once a week, at bed-time,
is highly beneficial. They act splendidly
on the Liver. A constipated habit of
body will be completely cured if the
patient will on each occasion, when
suffering, take a dose of Frootoids in-
stead of an ordinary aperient. The
sufferer thus gradually becomes quite
independent of Aperient Medicines.
Price 1/6. From all Chemists and
Medicine Vendors, and W. G. Hearne &
Co., Ltd., Geelong, Victoria.

The horde of middlemen are just about squeez-
ing the life out of the fruit-growing business in N. S.
Wales. Though the population has grown more than a
quarter of a million in 10 years, the area under fruit-
crops (other than oranges) has shrunk about 3500 acres :
Vines. Oranges. Other Fruits.

Guglielmo Peanutto pervades the city and suburbs in
hundreds ; he stands three deep in a city block, and
pays unnecessary thousands a year in rents—or, at
least, the fruit consumer is sucked of the thousands.
Hawkers hang on to the fringe of the business. They
“mix it” occasionally with the bottle-o profession ; and,
though the man with even the largest gift for ’awkin
probably doesn’t make enough to keep Tait in cigars,
their prices are not much better than Peanutto s, simply
because their turnover is so ridiculously small. What is
called for is a scheme by which the producers could shoot
their goods into a distributing depot; and if the
depdt had about 10,000 customers who took a
box of fruit every week, the food ought to be
about the cheapest instead of about the dearest in the
market, and the orcharding business ought to also look
up. Some Sydney people, calling themselves the United
Fruit Co., threaten to erupt on some such lines ; and if
they can get the right amount of support at both the pro-
ducing and the consuming ends, there ought to be pick-
ings for them while they live, and daisies on their grave
after they are dead.

“Ossy”: I hope McGowen will find time to
brino - N.S.W. into line with the rest of the Common-
wealth and M.L. by passing a law dealing with the con-
trol of land boilers. Many of these bombs are liable at
any moment to explode, with much loss of life. That
escapes are frequent and miraculous, I know well, for I
spend my life mending old, neglected wrecks, which are
only waiting for some little extra strain to scatter
themselves and any adjacent humans over the land-
scape. It is a deplorable thing that the Ma
State should allow any boiler in any condition
to be worked by anybody (mines excepted). Went
to look at a boiler recently, which, the owner said,
was “leaking” in the firebox. While scraping some of
the rust away the scraper went clean through ! And that
man had been carrying 601 b. steam per square inch on
that boiler daily. Some of the men “in charge ”of these
bombs know as much about a boiler as the boiler knows
of them whereas in atl the other States and M.L. a man
must possess a “ ticket ” before he is allowed to look
after a “kettle.”

“Demo”: At the Sheffield Trades Union Con-
gress, just before the last English mail left, three women
chainmakers attended. Not fashioners of watch fobs,
but of big heavy bullock chains—workers with sledge-
hammer and anvil. One of them flung and rattled down a
length of such chain on the floor. Says she : “ That’s
what we forge at a penny a yard (Shame ! Shame.!)—and
we strike for twopence-halfpenny an hour.” Three cheers
for Freetrade!
* * * *
“Hal”: A Southern matrimonial agency
advertises that it negotiates amicable and equitable
settlement of domestic differences, lovers’ quarrels, and
other disputes, for a “ preliminary fee,” of 2s. 6d. What
manner of human would the ambassador be, one wonders.
Elderly, I take it, and fatherly, and may-be bottle-nosed,
and probably addicted to Beer—he having drifted into
the Domestic Envoy line of business, owing, in all likeli-
hood, to evil fortune in the coal-canvassing trade, and
subsequent ill-luck as a book-agent. When the youth
of the period has had a disagreement with his best girl
he can get this minion, for a preliminary fee of 2s. 6d., to
call on her and send in his card, and mention that he has
arrived to expostulate. And then he will, presumably,
breathe a good, strong alcoholic breath on the premises
and proceed to argue. Anyone who wants to understand
what the romance of love really is should try the experi-
ment of getting his future wife remonstrated with for
2s. 6d. by the decayed missionary of a matrimonial
agency. The girl who can stand being reproached and
possibly wept upon by a depressed elderly stranger, who
has a few notes about her principal faults and failings in
his hat to refresh bis memory with, is either very deeply
in love or is of so mild a disposition that it is safe to risk
matrimony with her.

The man who prattles in favor of Private
Enterprise railways is nearly always the man who has
never had to use them. The West Coast of Tasmania has
to use them, and it doesn’t prattle. It curses vigorously
instead. A man lately had to take some stuff from Ben-
digo to Waratah. The freight on the Vic. Government
line from Bendigo to Melbourne (100 miles) was £5 ; from
Burnie to Waratah, on the shindykit line (47 miles), it
was £4O. The Tasmanian State lines charge on the
average 6s. lid. where the Emu Bay shindykit line
charges from 50s. to 605.: and where the Emu Bay shin-
dykit charges a passenger 12s. 6d. the State lines charge
ss. 4d. On the West Coast, when the Socialistic tiger is
mentioned, they smile. They reckon they are acquainted
with a much better tiger than Sosh will ever knowhow

“Manroose”: Apropos the Miles advt. (B.

saddler, who is an all-right tradesman at. his staple
industr’v and no slouch in the others. He puts in the
balance'of a leisured life at stuffing mattresses, doing up
furniture, rearing Christmas turkeys and gloating over
the Labor victory of 13th April.

A recent court case in which a Melbourne
minister alleged that he was fraudulently persuaded to
give £7 10s for a cow that wasn’t worth a third of the
sum disclosed tfvo cheerful pieces of sworn information
(l) that it is necessary to tell lies to sell a horse or cow ;
and (2) that 60s. is about the top price for “ choppers,” a
“ chopper” being the raw material out of which sausages
are built This paper has an idea that sausages, like
flannelette, should be declared a thistle or a noxious
weed on general principles, and the information about
choppers isn’t calculated to change this paper s mind.

IN BANANA LAND
The verdict in Bananaland is that the
| Scotchmen’s jaunt was a flat failure. They did
I n °t sep the lands which were really available for
» farmers. The visitors came to report upon the
chances of their countrymen to come and grab
i territory; the Banahalanders were anxious to
show them the cookies who would give them work
lat a wage, and not much of a wage at that. The
Chief Secretary’s officials made the itinerary
, arrangements; the Lands and Agricultural De-
partments were not in the reckoning at all.
j The washing up will take place'later on. The
i local aldermen unloosed floods of talk, and the
Commissioners replied with volumes of Imperial
; guff. It was a drawn game. The leader did con-
r elude with one thing of interest—that there was
! to p much locking up of good land convenient to
railways; and before they leave Australia they
may call for three cheers for Fisher’s land tax.
Edward L. Hanna, Manager of Telegraphs,
Brisbane, retired last week on a pension. He
clambered on to the back step of the Telegraph
Department as a messenger 49 years ago, and
climbed on to the box nine years back, on the
transfer of R. O. Bourne, late Public Service In-
spector. • Hanna, a Limerick man, is chockful of
yarns of the early days in Ipswich, Brisbane and
Rockhamptonr He had a lively time in the
“bread and blood riots” in 18G6, when the State
Treasury was empty and the construction gang—
about 500 strong—ori' the Dalby railway struck
because it couldn’t get its wages. The navvies
marched from Ipswich to Brisbane—lpswich was
the railway terminus in those days—and tried to
seize the Government stores in William-street.
The riot fizzled out; and the Government grabbed
a hand-y gold rush to send most of the men away
in the old Platypus to the Crocodile Diggings.
Of Hanna’s contemporaries, only King (Deputy-
Railway Commissioner), Heeney (member of
Lind Court), Kent (Sub-Collector of Customs),
and O’Connor (postmaster, Ipswich) are entitled
to a pension under the Civil Service Act of 1863.
King has had a Government job for 47 years;
Heeney, 44 years; Kent, 43 years; and O’Con-
nor, 41 years.
Bananaland has 114 barristers on its roll,
though only 61 practise in the State, or don’t
practise, as the case may be. The senior is ex-
.Tustice Stephen, of N.S. W. He was admitted in
1865. Bramston and Herbert—the first Attorney-
General and the .first Premier—follow next; then
come ex-Justice Simpson and Judge Rogers, both
of N. S. Wales; and they are followed by Casey,
Finlayson (Crown Prosecuter), Purves, Crompton
and Pennefather —all now or at onfe time or an-
other of the Victorian Bar. Now that ex-Judge
Noel has resumed the chase for the guineas, he is
the senior of the practising barristers. He
was admitted 29 years ago, and was on the Dis-
trict Court Betich for 27 years. Arthur Feez, the
only K.C. practising at the Queensland Bar, was
admitted a few months later. Fitzgerald—Attor-
ney-General in “ Andy ” Dawson’S Cabinet, when
the first Labor Ministry held office in Australia—
has chambers at Rockhampton and Longreach;
Blair —Attorney-General from 1903 to 1908 in the
Morgan and Kidston Cabinets —has a practice in
Brisbane. The remaining ex-Attorneys-General
still living in Australia—Griffith, C.J., Cooper,
C.J., Chubb, J.,. and Rutledge, D.C.J. —have
been wearing their horsehair on the Bench for
some years.
Progress is in the air ; even Warrigal the
’possum-eater feels it. The Protector tells how at
Atherton he found a full-blooded aboriginal em-
ployed drijjing a traction engine at 10s. a day,
while another, also full-blooded, was in regular
employment timber-felling for a sawmill at fis. a
day. A Bundaberg paper recently related how
local blacks raised the price of clothes-props from
3d. to 6d., and when asked whaffor the leading
Warrigal replied: “Mine tinkit must be all
alonga that plurry Wages Board.”
Rockhampton, which has been gnashing its
teeth over its tramway muddle, has at last got the
steam affairs going again. First, it imported a
foreign contraption to haul the cars along; and
when the foreign contraption went wrong, it im-
ported a foreign engineer to put the foreign con-
traption right—or as right as it is ever likely to
be. And in all the 12 months that Rockhampton
had to foot it to its work, it had under its nose, at
Mount Morgan, an object-lesson in the high
quality of Australian engines and Australian en-
gineers ; for there isn’t a concern in all the Com-
monwealth more thoroughly Australian from start
to finish than Mount Morgan, which Rockhamp-
ton mostly lives by.
A CHEERFUL PROSPECT.
OWNER (giving final instructions to

Pre insured the old mare for £250.
You’re on a tenner to nothing if she falls and breaks her Hanky neck!"
“San Remo,” from the middle of a
shindy :
The slop and other tailors of Brisbane are fighting hard
over the Wages Board award, which recently arrived after
a two years’ journey. The ink was hardly dry on the
paper before they were swinging on Minister Barnes’s
rubber ear, and objecting to the definition of a cutter.
They wanted another 12 months to be occupied
in deciding the matter. Barnes wouldn’t go that
far; but he agreed to chain up the award
while he called the Board together again. Next day the
slops and others were back with a tearful request that the
Chief Inspector of Shops and Factories should be em-
powered to grant exemption certificates to aged, slow
and infirm workers. The Act laid it down that these
exemptions were to be granted, by the Wages Board ;
but the factory-owner’s large, expansive heart almost
burst with grief because these unfortunate workers, par-
ticularly timid women and young girls, would have to go
before a Board, composed of unsympathetic men, some
of them Socialists. The Minister answered that he would
have to hear both sides of the argument. To give Barnes
his due, he always hears both sides; the trouble is he
usually only remembers one of them. Naturally, the
workers are kicking against the proposal to give an in-
spector power to grant certificates permitting the holders
to accept less than the minimum wage.
From a health point of view, as well as for
comfort and cleanliness, wool is the most satisfactory
material to wear next to the skin. It is absorbent, and,
being a bad conductor of heat, protects the body from
extremes of temperature. But there are degrees of
quality in all-wool socks and stockings. Most of them
shrink when washed and become too small to wear. The
finest hosiery made to-day is undoubtedly “Jason,” and
the makers guarantee every pair to be all wool and
unshrinkable. One of the important features of “Jason ”
isJts silk-like finish, making it delightfully soft to the
feel and most comfortable in wear. For the Christmas
season “ Jason ” hosiery is supplied in boxes, each con-
taining three pairs of men’s socks or three pairs of ladies’
stockings, and a box of “Jason,” with wishes for “a
happy and comfortable Christmas,” makes a most appro-
priate and acceptable gift. “ Jason ” socksand stockings
are made in all sizes and weights, and are sold by the
leading hosiers and drapers. If any difficulty is ex-
perienced, a postcard addressed to Jason Hosiery Co.,
Leicester, England, will bring the name of the nearest
agent.
Ballade of the Only Pebble!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IF Fortune smile upon you in your aspirations
high,
And frown upon your rival and your foe;
If ev’ry bell that jubilates beneath the jolly sky
bhould peal unto your praises as you go ;
If Joy be always with you and you never meet
a woe,
If Pleasure clip you closer than a leech.
Keep hand upon your collar and be sparing
with your crow—
You’re not the Only Pebble on the Beach !
If Love be sweet and kindly and approach with
laughing eye
When Delia dances by on merry toe ;
If no one in her graces with yourself can hope to
vie,
Then thank the little god that drew the bow ;
But let not giddy vanity your balance over-
throw,
Or silly Pride your judgment overreach,
Or haply yet the damosel may let her gallant
know—
He’s not the Only Pebble on the Beach !
We take our good-luck gaily, and wg never query
why ' .
The gods above have smiled upon us so ;
But how we look and wonder what has angered
Them on High
Phe moment that Affliction’s waters flow ;
But whether we be lucky or misfortune lay us
low,
One lesson should our varied fortune teach,
We do but joy and suffer as the winds of Heaven
blow—
We’re not the Only Pebble 6n the Beach !
The Fates are not so partial as we fancy, and I
trow
They play not so unkindly as we preach,
For daily do their dealings to the don of Adam
show
He’s not the Only Pebble on the Beach !
QUEENSLAND. ••
FURNESS BORN.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane. October 29, 1910.
Mr Dear Thargomindah.—
Can a cathedral be unlucky ? Our new one of
the Anglican persuasion was opened on a Friday-
last Friday. There was much clattering of bells
and fluttering of canonicals,, and the uniforms of
the local and visiting bishops were gladder than
the duds of Solomon. The Bishop of New Guinea
was draped in cloth of gold, or a good imitation
of that luxury, while the Primate, swathed in a
crimson robe with a full scarlet train, floated in
the ecclesiastical way like a burning meteor.
Thanks to the efforts of the small but indus-
trious Ganley, the huge crowd found itself seated
without confusion, and the procession never made
a false step. The lilies upon the grand altar were
not more immaculate than the behavior of all
concerned, save our own Archbishop, who, in the
excitement of the moment, tripped over the Ten
Commandments—just as your Mario is apt to do
herself at times, to the confusion of the family.
Wee Macgregor wore his Wiirdsor gold lace, and the
Scarlet aide was in artillery finery. The Chief
Justice and Judge Chubb donned their legal best,
and flared in the crimson of law and order.
The bells, long silent, were temporarily hanged
and pealed hysterically, while Sampson made
music on the new organ. Later the beasts fed,
and the Macgregor, starting with the Ark,
steered a metaphorical passage through the flood
of years to the landing stage of the Present.
The final evening of the Opera Co. was a bril-
liant affair, and the company was “all out” at
the finish—Roberts, and Bel Sorel and Miss
Buckman in particular. What this co. does it
does “good and hard’’—including the kissing,
and Friday night was a record even at that.
Everyone kissed everyone else, until conductor
Hazon expected to see the principals melt before
his eyes. When the curtain went up for the
500th time, Bracy was dragged out of the
manager’s box by Carmen, and compelled to make
his bow prettily.
By the way, there is a distinct aroma of orange
blossoms in the operatic air, particularly in the
vicinity of little Buckman and Ernest Toy. Any-
how, voice and violin go very nicely together. I
hear that Rosina is one of the elect for the Melba
season, while, of course, Toy is a certainty.
At last it seems likely that we are to have
rational summer entertainments. Tramways
Badger has made several important engagements'
in the singing line, and henceforth it will’ be the
thing for the 400 to take the other 400 to Dbtton
Park, and hold her hand under the trees while
Mrs. Gilbert Wilson and Philip Newbury warble
in the open air. The spot is one of the most
beautiful in the city ; it overlooks the river, and
there is always a breeze, while the dozens of elec-
tric lights hanging from the branches! make it
fairy land that can be reached on a thrippeny
tram.
Mrs. D. T. Seymour has folded her wings into
the regulation cabin trunks, and left for London.
Miss Seymour goes the first stage of the journey
with her.
A very petite bride, who is within the boundary
of your city at the present time, is, or was, Miss .
Ceeile Uleoq. She married her Mr. Potts in the
utmost quiet on Wednesday evening last.
The death of such women as Mrs. John Waugh,
whose passing occurred last week, is in the
nature of a calamity. Her home on the North Quay
has been for years the rendezvous of the thinker,
the practical charity worker and the reformer!
Mrs. Waugh, who came to Brisbane with her doc-
tor husband in ’63, and remained until her death,
was sister-in-law to Holman Hunt, and to Thos!
Woolner, the sculptor. She was one of the pro-
moters of the Pioneer Club here, and for years
was its president.
Invitations are out for the annual sports of the
Bowen House School, where some hundreds of
lads are preparing for the higher branches of
learning. At these gatherings Mr. and Mrs.
Knox Carson have instituted the sensible idea
of asking for a small contribution from each
guest towards the funds of our needy General
Hospital.
The National Council has at last hit upon a
practical scheme. This shapes into a committee
of public health and municipal reform, whereby a
she-coterie will make periodical rounds of inspec-
tion, and, having nosed out that which is unfit, will
pursue the city fathers and ask them what they’re
going to do about it. And you know what a nose
the average woman has for the unfit!
I am told that the Cathedral Chapter regards
the offertory of £921 as distinctly unsatisfactory.
The gilt cards of invitation were accompanied by
the following;—
As the most liberal offerings of all Church people of our
Diocese are urgently needed, in order to raise the £5OOO
si ill required for their Cathedral, it is expected that
everyone who is privileged to be present at the Consecra-
tion Service will give nothing less than Gold at the Col-
lection.
Even canons failed to bring off that stand and
deliver.
Cairns is busy again in its great mission of
human hybridisation. A few days ago a native of
Batavia married an aboriginal girl, and a local
official secured the honor of the first kiss. The
“Voice that breathed o’er Eden ” sighed plaint-
ively, and Cairns cried out enthusiastically
“ Hi-yah !”
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
Though the Dawson Valley line has been
long' promised, and though the whole railway-
builders’ paraphernalia is on the spot, something
hinders it. To begin with, the survey, after leav-
ing Mount Morgan station, runs straight on to the
bigco’s. preserves, takes off a corner of the Carlton
House grounds—the snoozing place of visiting
directors, etc.—whizzes past the private quarters
of the bosses, and knocks out an athletic club-
house and part of the lower works. And the
Government seems to be thinking hard before
bumping troubles of that size.
The Kid-Philp Government, inspired and
backed by the Courier, is using the Bible-in-
State-schools business to stir up sectarian strife
with a view to splitting up the Labor party. At
least, so says the Hon. Peter Murphy, a promi-
nent Leg. Councillor and Government supporter.
For months now the Courier has been publish-
ing a series of venomous letters from militant
Catholics and Protestants with an intent that
must be obvious to the dullest. If the fires of
Smithfield don’t crackle again in Bananaland it
won’t be the fault of the Tory press.
A plaint from the North : ‘
Brisbane Worker is busy preparing to drive out of the
Parliamentary Babor party certain members who have
recently incurred its displeasure. These men are car-
tooned as traitors destroying the platform, and are
alluded to as ex-Labor members. Over 20 Parliamentary
Babor members (including four men who had been
leaders or acting leaders) have been driven out since the
party’s inception, mainly by the intolerance of the Babor
organ. And, apparently, the end is not yet. Every
man who is pelted out in this way takes a certain elec-
toral following with him, with the result that Queens-
land (where a Babor Government ought to be more
easily got than anywhere else in Australia) lags behind
N. S. Wales, Westralia and S. Australia, and threatens to
be even beaten by Tasmania. There is surely something
very rotten about the organisation of the party when it
can't hold its men better. A traitor or two one expects ;
but this wholesale backsliding looks as though somebody
furtively' greases the floor and then pushes.

the late John J. Fulton discovered that the text hooks had no

difficulty, he set out in a new direction to evolve an emollient
that would reduce inflammation in-the kidney tissues. He
worked it out, and now about 87 in every 100 cases, both of
Diabetes and Bright’s Disease, even in chronic forms, are
shown to be curable. __ ...

Chest com-
plaints can be cured
by SCOTT’S
Emulsion
Chest trouble, acute or
chronic, is cured by taking
Scott’s Emulsion. Scott’s
Emulsion permanently cures
chest trouble. This statement
is made because hundreds of
people have written to say
they were cured of chest
troubles by Scott’s Emul-
sion. For example, Mrs. Ada
Ward wrote, 12th February,
1909, from 61, Morehead
Street, Redfern, Sydney,
N.S.W.:
"An attack of measles and bronchitis left
my daughter with a severe chest cold. I tried
many preparations, but noth-
ing did any good until I gave
Scott’s Emulsion. After the
first bottle she ceased to cough
up blood and phlegm, and
soon she was completely cured,
and is now a fine healthy girl.
This trademark was on the
emulsion I bought.”
f
If you wish to get rid of your
chest trouble, and decide to
buy Scott’s Emulsion, de-
cide also to GET SCOTT’S
EMULSION. You may be
asked to buy another emul-
sion and told it is “just as
good as Scott’s.” Substitute
emulsions can only be sold
on the reputation of Scott’s
Emulsion.
Scott’s Emulsion cures the disease—
no matter the age of the patient—and
will be approved by your Doctor for
Chest Trouble if you ask him.
Of all Chemists and Dealers in Medicines.
STOP
SMOKING!
OST MEN would cure themselves of
m the Tobacco habit if they knew they
could do so easily and without discomfort.
It takes but ten minutes for tobacco to
change the beats of the heart. To keep it
up is to tempt death by Heart Disease,
Nervous Collapse, Tobacco Cancer, and
Stomach, Liver or Kidney Disease.
TOBACCO SPECIFIC is a harmless,
vegetable remedy that will make the user
of tobacco in any form absolutely abandon
the habit for good. It not only destroys
the craving, the desire, the appetite for
tobacco, but restores to health the entire
nervous system, and aids nature in entirely
eliminating from the system the Nicotine
Poison.

Beg.ns to look as though Australia has lost
another energetic son in The Mclntosh, who is rapidly
accumulating so many vested interests in England that
Australia will become a side-line. First of all, he arranged
for a regular circuit of punching establishments, so that
a boxer could have quite a run of wallopings either
debited or credited to him before finally retiring from the
limelight, just as the man with the song about the baby
does on the Ilickards circuit in Australia. He has also pur-
chased or acquired a fine building somewhere on the con-
fines of London, where a new sort of club will be started,
and the athlete at the zenith of his fame can live the rose-
strewn life. Inter alia, it all means money to The
Mclntosh.
* * -» *
Hugh D. Mclntosh is running his “eliminating
tiials” for the purpose of finding a white champion to
exterminate the Sable Horror from Texas on what may
be termed genteel lines. The writer has been forwarded,
from London, a gilt-edged card, attached to which, by a
tasselled silk cord, is the daintiest of white and silver
pencils. The contraption is on the lines of a suburban
dance programme, and is issued by Hugh to his patrons
in order that they may note the amount of blood,
hair, teeth and so forth that are spilt during
the battles. Says Hugh, on the back of the affair:
“ This card represents a new, and, it is hoped, a desirable
feature in boxing.” It does. And if the combatants
were forced to wear macintoshes during the proceedings,
and use eau-de-cologne, and hit gently, and refrain from
spitting, swearing and disputing the referee’s decision,
the ring would be an idyllic spot to which one could lead
Mr. Judkins without a qualm.
* * * *
Johnson is certainly a born money-maker.
Hearing that some film people wanted to fix up with him
for some fight poses, he hurried down and suggested
that they should get a combined cinematograph and
phonograph, and he would do a stunt. The machine was
brought along, and Mistah Johnson putin a pleasant and
profitable afternoon telling the implement his account of
the fight, and discussing the chances of the men who
might be pitted against him. Then he hoisted himself
into his motor car, heavier with the weight of 10,000dols.
and a royalty share in the profits.
* * * *
Johnson is fond of glitter, and his negro
admirers are making him a present that should strike
even his fireproof eyes stone-blind. This fearful thing is
called a championship belt, is to be of solid gold and
diamonds, and will be worth £5OOO, all subscribed by his
black brudders. It seems that Johnson has taken to
motoring seriously, and will participate in a race at Old-
fields, and he has promised that he will first wear the
gaud (in public) on that occasion. He won’t risk the
belt, but says he is willing to stake its value that he will
win his race. Johnson may be a hero ; but he promises
to look more like a pawnbroker’s window.
* * * *
Stanley Ketchell being dead, negro Sammy
Langford steps forward, and, grabbing the dead man’s
shoes, remarks that if Billy Papke wants “ them shoes” he
knows where to find them. He also mentions—as a side
consideration, of course—that Billy can find £6OOO in the
same place, providing he is prepared, in the event of
disaster, to leave an equal sum behind him. So far,
Billv, like Saturn, has said nothing.
• * * *
A London firm announces the publication of
“The Life and Battles of Sam Langford, whose victory over
‘ Iron ’ Hague, coupled with Jack Johnson’s default, con-
stitute him file World’s Champion Boxer.” If that
doesn’t drag the big Texan nigger off the stage and into
a ring with the formidable Samuel, nothing will.
* * * *
Another large spike was hammered into the
coffin of professional wrestling a month back, when Zbysco
took on a newcomer from India, Gama by name. It was
supposed that no hall in London would hold the crowd, so
they appeared in the open air at the Stadium. Zbysco went
down at the first grapple, and stayed down, refusing to
do any work. For a long hour and a half he remained on
his stomach, with the Indian crawling all over him and
hauling ineffectually. (Loud appeals to “get busy,”
etc.) Then he stood up. (Cheers.) In less than a
minute he was down again. (Wild yells, lasting for
another hour.) After 2hr. and 40min. the referee told
them they might as well chuck it, and the pair shook
hands. (Ugly rush, during which Zbysco had to be
“ escorted ” to his dressing-room.)
* * * *
There is great argument in England as to
.whether young Australian Wootton laid a trap for ex-
perienced Yankee Maher in the St. Leger. Some think
it was done unwittingly ; anyway, the trap opened, and
Maher fell in. Maher, on Lemberg (which on paper
couldn’t lose), was just behind Wootton, on the uncon-
sidered Sw.vnford. The latter opened out just a little, and
Maher cut in on the rails. Then Wootton closed in again,
and Maher was in a pocket. He had to pull back and out
—bumping, meanwhile, into Bronzino, which might
otherwise have won—andSwynford finished the luckiest
winner of modern times.

KilLick, the all-round English cricketer who has
just been given a “benefit” bv his count}’, has never
missed playing in a match for Sussex since July, 1898—a
run of about 330 consecutive matches without injury,
illness, or loss of form. Quaife’s record for Warwickshire
is almost more remarkable. He has averaged 40 runs an
innings for 17 years, without ever being hurt or ill,
though he has missed a few matches from other causes.
But his benefit after all only brought him £5OO. Killick's
was worth about the same. Hirst holds the record, with
£3OOO.
* * * *
Somebody has inundated this office with
Yankee and B.C. papers intimating that Tahmmy Burns
is likely to bring a bedazzling baseball team to this
country to show it how to play the game. So far, no one
has detected any wild enthusiasm over b.b. in Australia.
But, perchance (who knows ?), Tahmmy’s magic person-
ality may count for as much as five righteous men do
in Sodom.

Albert E. Nash, chairman of the N.S. W. Rowing
Association, made some remarks at Sydney, some months
ago, to members of the Maoriland skiff crews on their
way home from the big regatta at Hobart. Nash’s griev-
ance was the regrettable lack of interest in eight-oar
rowing in the Dominion, and the remarks thereaneht ap-
pear to have had good effect. Recent successes in
lighter-manned shells have screwed up the amateur
association’s ambition to win the blue ribbon of the
Australasian sculling fleet, and Nash’s spur was applied
at a favorable moment. Tne chances are, therefore, that
the M.L. flag will fly amongst the eights, if not next year,
then in 1912.

11 The shooting for the King’s Prize at Williams-
town (Vic.)—which is part sport and part patriotism-
resulted in a narrow win for F. Christian, of the Bright
Rifle Club (Vic.) Christian tied with Harrison (the ulti-
mate runner-up) in the final shoot at 1000 yards, each
scoring 323. In the shoot-off Christian led by a couple of
points, and thus secured a first prize composed of £7O in
cash, a gold medal and a couple of trophies. The
winner, an engine-driver, had previously done little as a
rifle shot; but the second man, Harrison, was runner-up
in the King’s at Randwick (N.S. VV.) in 1907.

One of the events that is casting its shadow
before is a revival of the lately busted game of ping-pong.
When it was invented it became a sort of mania, and
when the reaction set in it died suddenly. Now people
are beginning to remember that, taken in moderation, it
was, like most other things, not too bad. It was a good
parlor game in which the sexes could take equal parts,
and it called for no great expenditure of brain-sweat or
energy. And yet it required a quick eye, an alert poise
and the exercise of judgment. And for a parlor game
what more does the most exacting want?
*■*-**
Outback horse-racing still holds the cake for
noveltv. At the recent Eight-hour meeting at Cobar
(N.S.\V.) the first event was run three times (two of the
starts being designated “ unsatisfactory ”) ; and the gee-
gees were sent on their w’ay the third time after seven
false st irts. Later in the day the “ big ” handicap was a
walk-over for one prad ; but, 10 minutes later, another
owner sent his gee-gee over the course to claim the
second money which was going begging. The meeting
was described as a “ financial success ” —and doubtless
nearly everybody was satisfied some way or other over
the mixed affair.

experience. lam sure that
hundreds of your Appliances

the unfortunate sufferers
only knew of its existence.

deserve the universal grati-
tude of mankind for invent-

are perfectly free to make
what use you please of what
I sav in this letter.

“ Dear Sir,—Having- worn your Appli-
ance from the time it arrived, I think it
my duty to acknowledge that your
Appliance saved my life. By wearing- a
common steel truss I fell back under 10
stone in weight, and since wearing your
Appliance for the past two months, I
have increased to the weight of 13 stone.
I can now do my heavy work with ease,
and must thank you for your kindness
and the straightforward manner you
dealt with me. I shall do all in my
power to recommend your Appliance to
friends around who suffer from this
terrible complaint. You can make what
use you like of this letter, and I will an-
swer with pleasure any letters from those
who would like to know about the
Appliance. Yours truly, S. J. KING.”

Forest Devil. WW

c. '
The Roots Must Come Out,
as well as the Trunk.
POSITIVELY the hardest work the Farmer, Settler or Squatter is called upon to do is
grubbing. The old method of uprooting dry or green stumps and trees is now entirely
revolutionised by the introduction on the market of the most marvellous labor-saving
device for Farmers,' etc., ever invented. It is called “ The Bunyip Forest
Devil.” This particular Forest Devil is far superior to any other Forest Devil in the market,
in that it is the very essence of simplicity in adjusting and in manipulating. The most
admirable features of “ The Bunyip Forest Devil ” are that it is not only light in weight
and can be moved with the greatest ease from tree to tree, where it can be rapidly fixed and
adjusted, but it is absolutely certain to accomplish almost any task set to it.
The tremendous strain which can be brought to bear with “The Bunyip Forest
Devil ” makes it absolutely imperative for the tree or stump to leave the ground entirely—
roots and all, no matter how big the tree or stump, how long it has been growing, or how
firmly it be rooted in the ground.
Many “land men,” once doubtful of the assertions claimed for it, are now loud in their
praises of the unbounded and entire satisfaction it has given in their case, and in many
instances they have paid for the cost of the machine in a very short while by hiring it to
their neighbors.
Convincing proof of its wonderful power and its durability, the quickness with which it
can be adjusted, the labor and money it saves, will be found in a special and attractive
catalogue Messrs. John Cooper & Sons, 287-289 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne, have just issued.
Copies will be sent free to every enquirer, together with any other information required.
When writing, please mention this paper.

The long-postponed worm has turned at
last with curses in its mouth, and rolling up its
sleeves, has requested its enemy to come on ; also,
the brilliant footwork it has displayed in the ring
has bowled the opponent first ball. For about the
7,000,000 th time a parson has been expounding
about the ridiculousness of woman’s dress —the
absurdity of her intoxicated skirt, and the mad-
ness of her big hat, and the dangerous lunacy of
her corset. And a woman has replied coldly in the
public press to the effect that the parson himself is
a blot on the landscape, with his ill-fitting
black tubular garments; his strange waistcoat,
which seems to be buttoned up behind by a lady
curate ; his wonderful collar, that ties at the back ;
his long, flapping inky coat; his hat, which is the
color of the Earl of Hell’s boots; and the hat-
rigging, gaiters, apron, petticoats and tassels
which he assumes when he gets high up the sacer-
dotal tree. A weird creature like this, she
reckons, shouldn’t talk about clothes. And, for
the moment, the Church is as badly stunned as if
it had been hit on the skull with its own plate.

Boils, Pimples, Spots, Rashes and all
Spring Skin-Troubles Banished.
With the approach of Spring do you find little rough
patches on your forehead, or cheek, or chin ? Has your
skin a curious “tight” feeling? Are your hands or
finger-ends sore ? Is your skin, because of its burden
of impurity, disfigured by nasty pimples, boils,
abscesses, or eruptions ? Have you a raw, tender
feeling where your skin creases—or are you very liable
to chafing about the neck ?
These “danger signals,” which constitute the first
signs of an unhealthy skin, should never be neglected.
Following in their train are all the tortures of fiery
eczema, wide-reaching blood poison, and ulcerous sores.
Nothing is more important than the way we should treat
this skin disease. It is not the slightest use relying upon any
internal remedy or external application if these do not reach
the impurity itself, which is the cause of the disorganisation
in our delicate and intricate tissues. Cheap and coarse ointments
and so-called blood-mixtures may make eczema “ slumber ”
awhile, but the disease soon breaks forth in all its “ fire ” and
itching irritation, for the root-evil has not been touched.
Zam-Buk, because of its absolute purity, is the ideal Spring
skin-balm. Zam-Buk is so refined that the tissues absorb it
readily; and its medicinal essences at once attack the disease
below the surface. Wherever the skin has been injured by
accident or eaten by disease, Zam-Buk promotes the growth of
new and healthy tissues in a quick and marvellous manner.
Zam-Buk, the invaluable
Spring Skin • Balm, is
unequalled for Boils,
Pimples, Eruptions, Ec-
zema, Abscesses and
Blemishes; and promptly
heals Cuts, Burns, Sores,
Bruises, Abrasions,
Scalds, Scalp Troubles,
Wounds, Piles, Sprains
and Pains, etc.
Obtainable from Ml
Chemists and Stores at
1/6 per pot, or 3/6 family
siztf (containing nearly
four times the 1/6).
EVERY HOME NEEDS ZAM-BUK.
Mr. 11. Christie, of 1(5 London Street, Enrnore, Sydney, says:— ct l was
troubled with boils, and tried ad manner of things to get rid of them, but to
no avail. Seeing Zam-Rulc advertised as a cure, I procured a pot, and applied
it as directed, with the pleasing result that the boils had entirely dis-
appeared after three days’ treatment.”

A Psalm of Resignation.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN spite of his imposing plea,
A freeman, whom the truth makes free
Is often fairly up a tree,
And marvels why it should be thus.
Then reasoning, in his tinpot way,
That honesty can never pay.
He loses faith, as well he may $
Yet he has simply Missed the Bus.
Concerning noodles who profess
By moral rules to gauge success ;
Their thinking tackle’s in a mess,
And they are wrong to Tartarus.
Don’t say the worthiest lead the van,
That gag is deader than Queen Anne.
If it were straight, no honest man
Need grieve that he had Missed the Bus.
All are alike in Satan’s grip,
If we accept your Shakspeare’s tip,
Who hints, per Hamlet, that the whip
Is earned by every one of us.
Which is absurd (as Euclid says),
For all have good and evil traits,
Though some go smoothly all their days,
And some are doom’d to Miss the Bus.
Even the Yiddish Sage confessed
He had to give this problem best,
Namely, to find desert expressed
In terms of Need and Overplus.
He saw not damper to the wise,
Nor gonee to men of enterprise,
But Buckley’s prospect of a rise
For anyone who Missed the Bus.
What agencies manipulate
This economic drafting-gate
Through which we pass to find our fate.
It would be foolish to discuss ;
But any man with half an eye
Can see that mysteries underlie
The great “ Whaffor ?’’—the age-long “ Why?”—
Required by those who Miss the Bus.
Some swell-coves, narrowed by their luck,
In Evolution’s rut are stuck,
Hike that wool-bearing reptile-duck
,_ T *Y| l ' c b bushmen term the platterpus ;
Whilst in our class we often find
A stubborn attitude of mind
Attending the demnition grind
Dealt out to those who Miss the Bus.
Read Samuel Smiles, you dreaming flats J”
Say thrift-apostles, through their hats,
But wearily we answer, “ Rats !
It’s not worth while to make a fuss.
Preach us no Self-made Merchant’s creed—
Columbia’s Curse—which holds, indeed,
I hat we should loot our fellow-weed,
And help him but to Miss the Bus!”
This seems to summarise our case.
I hope we carry it with grace,
Acknowledging in Fate’s embrace
The nelson of an octopus.
And when the Hast Conveyance conies
Neither the swell who pots the plums,
Nor' we who fossick round for crumbs,'
Shall be allowed to Miss the Bus.

LAST bloke I hit got me three months
in jug,” remarked Mr. Toe, remind
cently; “ one afore that got me three
weeks in horspittle. Delikit-lookin’ little chap ’e
was, too. You wouldn’t ’ave thought ’e could ha’
said boo to a goose.”
That wot you ’it ’im fur?” inquired Mr.
Sharp, with interest.
‘‘Fur wot?” asked Mr. Toe, whose ideas
worked slowly.
‘‘Fur sayin’ boo,” explained Mr. Sharp.
Mr. Toe reflected a moment.
“ There weren’t no goose at orl, Sam. That’s
on J, a hgger o’ speech,- like. ’E was sorcin’ rae.”
4 Wot s sorce fur the goose is sorce fur the
gander, Bill.
Mr. Toe sniffed thoughtfully, then changed the
conversation.
“Any bloke, black, yeller or white, wot calls
isseif a bloomin champion can git a match nowa-
days, he said, bitterly; “while ere am I, Bill
loe, the Brighton Boshter, spoilin’ fur a go, an’
yet nobody 11 put up a purse fur me—not even as
much as a mouldy tenner.”
“Yer spoilin’ orrignt, Bill,” said Mr. Sharp,
frankly. Oo d yer think’s goin’ to be silly mug
enuff to put up a purse fur a man ’oo the last time
,e went inter the ring; faked,the blessed show afore-
and fur five bob,down an’ a ticket in Tatt. ’s. Not
likely, mate. Torlc sense, do.”
“Jt wasn’t five bob; it were five jims,” cor-
rected Mr. Toe, firmly. “ But w®t’s the good o’
vappin , Sam ? I’m dead broke to the world, an’
there s an end of it.
“Wot, o’the woyld, Bill?” said Mr. Sharp,
blandly I m fraid, you ain’t got no interleck,
mate. Brute strength you ’ave, I own candid;
taas iir bins"- He broke off short and
shook his head at the pugnacious Mr. Toe
That worthy smiled sourly.
Took bad with one o’ them little ideas o’ yers
Sam? he inquired. “’Cos, if so, cough it up,
mate. Arves, Is pose?” “
Sam nodded.
“ I take the’ole risk ;so be rights I oughter
take at least three-parts the profits ; but with an
ole cobber, same as you, share an’ share alike’s
aHus bin my motter. Come acrost to the Rose an
we 11 fix it up over wot the Dagoes call a empty
cordial. Old on, matey; mind the step.”
As Mr. Isaac Solomon lolled indolently on the
counter of hi S second-hand clothing establish-
ment, Mr. Sharp suddenly presented himself in
the doorway.
. . Evenin, said the visitor, with a
friendly smile. ‘Ow s thin’s poppin’ ? ”
“ That you, Sam ? responded Mr.’ Solomon
.^ aS < .- rath , er^ earsighted - “Well, wodger
got this time. No more Brummagem ware, I
ope? The market’s over stocked.”
Mr. Sharp s smile widened into a broad grin as
he produced a massive gold watch and chain from
his pocket.
• 1 Ain’t it a fair boshter?” he said, with enthu-
You 11 ave to come down real ’andsonie
fur once, Ilcey, ma tear. The pounds an*
pounds I’ve spent tryin’ to find the ’eart-broken
owner o’ this ’ere loverly lost watch an’ chain
you’d’ardly b’lieve. P’r’aps you seen the adver-
tisements wot I put in the noospapers orl outer
me own pocket ? ”
“May ha’ done, but I didn’t take no notice of
’em if I did,” remarked Mr. Solomon, dryly.
Where d’yer say ver found it, Sam ? ”
“Fitzroy Gardens,” replied Mr. Sharp, rubbing
his nose reflectively. “Funny nobody claimin’
the thin’, ain’t it ? ”
Mr. Solomon’s right eyelid drooped languidly,
and, fumbling in his coat, he produced a pair
of spectacles, which he leisurely adjusted.
“’Arf a mo,” requested Sam. “I’m thinkin’
o’ wearin’ that ’andsome watch an’ chain fur an
hour or two this evenin’. I’ll bring ’em back
afore you put the shutters up. It’s like this : I’m
goin’ to dinner at Guv’ment ’Ouse, an’ them sort
o’ people thinks a lot of a bloke’s clobber, y’
know; so I’ll ’ave to go mockered up classy-like.
Couldn’t very well git outer it this time ; yer see
I’ve bin arst so orfen. Can you give me the loan
of a black soot an’ a silk ’at fur to-night, Ikey ?”
“’Ave you got beetles in yer arcade, Sam, or
wot?” demanded Mr. Solomon, with some stern-
ness. “ Any’ow, I don’t want none o’ yer funny
games ’ere; so you jest clear out o’ this quick ’n’
lively.”
“It’s orright, Ikey; no skite,” replied Mr.
Sharp. “Little bit o’ business’tween me an’a
friend o’ mine, that’s orl. I’ll return the clobber
safe an’ sound, an’ sell ye the watch cheap.”
Mr. Solomon regarded him suspiciously.
“If I do, it’ll be ten bob orf o’ wotever I give
yer fur the ticker, an’ extra if there’s any damage
done to the clobber,” he said with decision.
A quarter of an hour later Sam issued frqm Mr.
Solomon’s sanctum. He looked wondrous re-
spectable in a black frock coat not more than one
size too large for him. He wore a collar and tie,
baggy tweed trousers, double-reefed at the ankles,
and a ruffled silk hit of bell-like appearance,
which sagged over his ears. A heavy gold watch-
chain bisected his vest. He carried a parasol
which the short-sighted Mr. Solomon had thrust
upon him at the last moment under the firm belief
that it was an umbrella. Sam felt that on the
whole he was a success. He threaded the Port
Melbourne streets at a rapid pace, but slackened ]
speed.somewhat as he drew near the Rose public-
house and espied advancing towards him the
burly form of Mr. Toe.
“ Why, Sam, I ’ardly noo yer,” he declared,
with a hoarse chuckle. “My oath, you done
yerself proud, no error ! Is that ’ere the watch
an’ chain you was tellin’meof? Glad you wore
’em ; they looks quite perfess’nal-like. Well, you
got ’em orl on proper, my word !”
Much to Sam’s relief, the parasol escaped
criticism. During the course of his walk he had
more than once been sorely tempted to jettison
the obnoxious article, but a well-founded fear
that Mr. Solomon might assess its value at an
abnormal figure restrained his inclination.
‘Sure you ain’t makin’ any mistake, Bill?
Yer positive yer know the bloke?” he asked,
impatiently.
“Do I know ’im !” exclaimed Mr. Toe, with
fine scorn. “Do I not know ’im—ole man Puddi-
pliat! Why, ev’ry Friday evenin’ ’bout this
time, reg’lar as clockwork, he comes down from ’is
orfice in Flinders-lane to ’is ware’ouse in Silver-
street with a little canvas-bag in ’is breast-pocket,
an’ inside o’ that ’ere little bag’s the
week’s wages o’ the men as works fur ’im at the
ware’ouse. ’E alius stops fur a drink at the Rose
on ’is way, an’ be ’as another ’un at the Chequers
goin’ ’ome. I'll do the stoushin’, trust me, Sam.
You know wot yer gotter do, don’t yer ? ”
“I hat’s orright,” said Sam, offhandedly.
“Mind you’it ’im ’ard enuff, on’y not too ’ard,
Bill. But look ’ere, we mustn’t be see’d torkin’
together, matey; people might wunner wot a
good-lookin’, ’andsome, well-dressed medical
gen’leman, same as me, was doin’ along o’ a”
“Yer second-’and cady’s floppin’ over yer dirty
ears,”, interrupted Mr. Toe, coldly. “Yer job-
lot tie’s climbin’ up yer paper collar, an’ one o’
them ’a’penny bootlaces is come undone. Well,
I’m goin’ inter the Rose against ole short-an’-fat
shows up. You trot about outside an’ keep yer-
self warm, Sam. If it do start rainin’ never mind
that ere pretty little ladylike uinberella o’ yers—
jest pull yer classy tile well down over yer shoul-
ders an’ yer won’t want no other perteckshun.
So long, mate. Don’t furgit to feel pore old Pud-
diphat’s pulse, an’ yer might take ’is feverish ’igh
temp’rature while yer ’bout it.”
He laughed rudely, and only lingering to insti-
tute a comparison between Mr. Sharp and an !
elderly ape, with points in favor of the latter, he
lurched across the road and disappeared through
the swing-doors of the Rose.
In nowise disconcerted by his confederate’s
strictures, Mr. Sharp posted himself in a com-
manding position at the entrance of a gloomy
right-of-way, and lighting a cigarette in honor of
his gala attire, philosophically awaited the advent
of the doomed Puddiphat. He was not kept long
in suspense. The saloon-bar door of the Rose
suddenly swung back, and there emerged a short,
elderly gentleman of portly habit, who wore
aggressive grey whiskers, and a boxer hat, tilted
at a rakish angle. Close on his heels came Mr
Toe.
“ I don’t want to have anything more to say
to you, sir. I don’t know you, and I don’t
want to know you. You’re quarrelsomely in-
toxicated, sir you’re a drunken bellige-
rent. I look upon you as a decidedly dan-
gerous individual. No, no; don’t answer me
back, please. I can’t hear the sound of my own
voice what with you talking,” said the old gentle-
man, heatedly.
“Ho,indeed! Lucky thin’fur you. Itain’tnone
too sweet,’’sneered Mr. Toe. “I’m drunk, am I
—in yer opinion ? An’ ’oo are you ?—-if I might be
so bold as to kindly arst.”
“Get out of my way, sir. I won’t be intimi-
dated, spluttered the incensed Puddiphat. “If
I could only see a constable I’d give you in charge
as an undesirable character. Allow me to pass
immediately. Stand aside at once, sir.” He lent
emphasis to his words by giving the bellicose Mr.
Toe a slight shove.
“My Gawd! yer arstin’ fur it! Put up yer
props, quick ’n’ lively—let’s see’ow yer shape,”
requested that gladiatorial gentleman with
acrimony.
He sparred scientifically at the courageous
Puddiphat, who, with admirable generalship, got I
home first blow, per medium of his umbrella.
The next moment he was sprawling in the gutter!
“Look out—Johnnop! Mizzle, mate!” An
interested spectator spoke, and, without waiting
for a second warning, Mr. Toe took to his heels
and fled.
He need not have hurried himself, however • it
was not a policeman at all, but only Mr. Sharp
He came bustling briskly into thelittl'e circie which
had gathered about the prostrate Puddiphat.
“ Stan’ back there—stan’ back do, an’ give the
pore chap a breath o’ hair,” petitioned Sam
authoritatively. “I’m a doctor. ’Orridcowardly
sault—saw it orl. The scoundrel oughter be
ung, drawed an’ slaughtered.” He bent over the

THE BATTLE OF LIFE.
Efficiency Depends upon Health. Health Depends upon the Kidneys.
Every man or woman who works must keep healthy, if work is to be done efficiently. The unfit,go to the wall. Good
work depends upon good health. Work becomes a nightmare to those who are not well. ARE YOU EFFICIENT ?
Or are you Depressed, Tired, Suffering from Broken Sleep, Backache, Pains in the Limbs, Bad Taste in the Mouth ? All
these are symptoms that your kidneys are weak or diseased, and unable to carry out their work of filtering the blood and
keeping it pure. The Kidneys are the Kilters of Life. All these
symptoms are forerunners of Dropsy, Rheumatism, Urinary
Diseases, Gravel, Stone, Neuralgia, all of which are Kidney
Diseases. Only a kidney medicine can cure you. Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills act on the kidneys, and on the kidneys only. They
will keep you bright, free from pain, from backache and headache.
They will keep you efficient.
LASTING SYDNEY CURE.
Mr. John Loaney, 20 Swanson Street, Erskineville, Sydney, states“l wish to give you particu-
liirs of my experience with Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. I owe these pills a debt of gratitude, for
they have cured me of very serious kidney diseases. My ill-health commenced three years ago, when I
first had to lay up. I had terrible pains in my back and right side, and my secretions scalded, and were
thick and contained sedimentary matter. I also had fits of giddiness, and every day I would have a
violent headache. For two years I spent an average of two weeks out of every three in bed, and even
when up I was very ill. I had the best medical advice and treatment to be procured ; ten leading Sydney
physicians treated me in the three years of my illness ; their bills totalled £lBO. The general idea was
that I suffered with stone in the kidneys, and I was constantly advised to undergoan operation. At last
a specialist put me under the X rays. ■ He tol(J me that it was unnecessary to be operated on, as my
kidneys were too far gone for an operation to benefit me. I gave up all hope of recovery, and fully
expected to die soon, and my friends were of the same opinion. My lawyer was brought home, and made
out my will; I was held up to sign it. Not long after this I was advised to use Doan s Backaehe Kidney
Pills. The man who urged me to give this remedy a trial had been cured by it, and had the utmost faith
thorough ottiucou, ou jl oouw iwi ** ° u ppv w v — t v ~ j i
cured. I felt no good effects until I was using the third box ; but after that my recovery was gradual
The medicine I took before I got Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills would stock a chemist s shop. I had
fallen away five inches round the waist, but I have regained all the lost weight. I might mention that
the operation which had been suggested was to cost me £6O. My cure by Doan s Backache Kidney Pills
cost me less than 30s. If I had used these pills when I first got ill, I would be considerably over £2OO
richer to-day. Mv recovery is well know;n, and may be authenticated by many ; but if any sufferer
would like to call," I shall be glad to substantiate this testimonial.” .
Four years later Mrs. Loaney says“ lam pleased to be able to say now that my husband is still
free of kidney trouble. In fact, he was never better in his life, and is without ache or pain. I think his
cure is marvellous, for he is 77.”

motionless form of Mr. Toe’s victim. “Skelp
wound,” he announced, with conviction, “an’a
slight conclusion of ’is brains. ’Ere, two o’ you
men, lend a ’and ah’ carry ’im inside. Loose orl
’is elo’es an’ rub a little weak sperrits on ’is fore-
head —the kind ole Barney calls ’is extree speshul
’ll do fust-rate. Don’t let ’im drink none—’e’s ’ad
enuff orready. I’ll be back ag’in in five minutes ;
I must jest run roun’ to the Dispens’ry fur me
instruments.”
Ten minutes later, the perspiring Mr. Sharp
entered his small living-room in Emerald-street,
where he had previously arranged to meet Mr.
Toe and divide the spoils of the evening. Mr.
Toe was not forthcoming. Sam waited for nearly
an hour, then his sorely-tried patience forsook
him. He unfastened the little wash-leather bag,
from which came the cheerful chink of cash, and
poured forth upon the plain deal table a choice
collection of metal checks, brass counters, buttons,
the tabs off tobacco plugs, and other articles of
small intrinsic value, with here and there a bat-
tered copper coin. Mr. Sharp’s jaw dropped;
his hat, left to its own devices, settled firmly down
over his ears until his bewildered countenance suf-
fered a partial eclipse. He stood thus for some
moments, struggling vainly against the prompt-
ings of wrath and despair; then suddenly his
blood ran icy chill, his cheeks went white and
flaccid, and he groped frantically in every pocket
of his voluminous garments ; alas, to no purpose.
The watch and chain had disappeared ! For once,
Mr. Sharp lost control over himself. He snatched
off his obtrusive headgear and flung it across the
room, reckless of any damage it might receive in
course of transit; then, sitting down abruptly on
an empty pickle-case, he swore with great feeling
and fluency for fully five minutes.

Mr. Isaac Solomon was standing in the door-
way of his emporium, watching with considerable
interest the helpless infatuation of an inebriated
mariner for a powerfully-proportioned young lady
who was busily engaged in going through his
pockets, when Mr. Sharp turned the street corner
hurriedly, and, pushing unceremoniously past
Mr. Solomon, entered the narrow, evil-smelling
passage which led to the Hebrew’s private apart-
ments.
“ ’Ullo, Sam ! Wot, orready ? ” said Ikey as he
followed his client , into a small, stuffy office and
turned up the lamp. “I was jest picturin’yer
Smokin’ a bob seegar an’ drinkin’ ice’ coffee along
o’ orl them nobs. Wot brings yer back so soon,
mate? ”
44 Didn’t wait fur no dessert,” replied Mr. Sharp
with acidity.
“Wot, sour grapes?” inquired Mr. Solomon,
eyeing him askance. “Why, wotever yer done
with that inval’able gold watch an’ chain, Sam?”
Mr. Sharp coughed huskily.
“ I found the owner, Ikey,” he said in strangled
tones. “It’s more like a bit outer a storybook
than anythink else. It seems they belonged to
the Guv’ment ’Ouse adakonk the ’ole time.”
“Ada Konk—’oo’s she?” asked Mr. Solomon.
“Lady’s-maid, ’ouse-maid, or wot? It ain’t a
lady’s ticker neither.”
“O’ course, I couldn’t very well claim no
reward,” continued Mr. Sharp, ignoriiig the in-
terruption, “bein’ on friendly terms, like, with
the boss.”
“’Course not, mate,” said Mr. Solomon, shak-
ing his head decisively ; “not to be thought of
fur a minute. Funny thing, Sam ; an’ wot makes
it orl the more funnier still is, Bill Toe an’
4 Spotty ’ Pink—yer know Bill Toe, but yer dunno
‘Spotty’ Pink, do yer?—little short fat bloke,
with white chin-whiskers; great cobber o’ Bill’s.”
(Mr. Sharp started violently.) “ Well, they come
in ’ere together ’arf hour ago —not ’arf hour ago—
an’ 4 Spotty ’ sold me a gold watch an’ chain as
like that one o’ Ada wot’s-’er-name’s as two pins
—lO quid I give ’im fur it; an’, mind, I don’t say
as ’ow I shall be the loser. ‘Spotty’ ses ’e
wouldn’t ha’ dreamt o’ gettin’ rid o’ it on’y ’e’s
subjeck to fits—’plopleptic fits, pore chap—took
one in Graham-street this very night, so ’e told
me; an’ while ’e was ’avin’ it some mean-,
sperrited tough, wot called ’isself a doctor, come
along an’ pinched a little shammy-leather bag full
o’ pore 4 Spotty’s ’ ’ard-earned savin’s. 4 1
wouldn’t part with this ’ere ’andsome ’unter’s
watch an’ chain, Ikey,’ ’e ses to me, with the big
tears runnin’ down 'is face, 4 on’y I’m a pore man
meself, an’ I shouldn’t like to put temptation in
the way o’ other pore men, ’oo mightn’t be able to
resist it same as me.’ Eh, wot say, Sam ? ”
“ Wot I gotter say, I’ll say to Bill Toe ’is own-
self,” replied Mr. Sharp, speaking with difficulty.
“Don’t say nothink you might be sorry fur
arterwards,’’ counselled Mr. Solomon sagely.
“No, I won’t,” said Sam, with conviction.
“ ’Ere, gimme my clobber, Ikey ; sooner I git a
move on an’ ’as a few straightforward words with
Mr. Bill the better I’ll be pleased.”
Mr. Solomon wrinkled his brow.
“Let’s see; you give me five, bob deposit,
didn’t yer, Sam ? ’Fraid I’ll ’ave to trouble yer
to ’and over t’other five, ’cordin’ to agreement,”
he remarked, gently. “Umberella orright?
This bran’-noo silk ’at looks as if it ’ad bin kicked,
or set on, or summut—that’ll be a ’arf a crown
extra. Say 12 bob in orl, as it’s between mates.” .
Mr. Sharp fumbled in his pockets.
“’Ere’s tuppence more on account, Ikey; I’ll
’ave to owe yer the rest,” he said, sadly.

TOD MAGUIRE was a bad man. The
Rev. Joseph Jellico9, whoso trade was
reclamation, turned up the whites of his,
eyes and sighed when Tod was mentioned, and
his opinion was shared by 17 policemen whom
Tod had bitten on the way to the watch-house.
At the unripe age of 20 he had obtained 15 con-
victions for indiscretions, ranging from “insult-
ing behavior ” to assault and robbery. At 30
his sentences totalled his sum of years, his star
performance being set out in the records of
the C. I. Branch as “ burglary with wound-
ing, five years, General Sessions, 3/11/1903,”
For this he had achieved a quarter of a
column in the morning papers, and the even-
ing journal gave his case four black headlines, a
column and a half of minion, with frequent cross-
heads, a sub-leader paragraph, and two or three
little pars in the “N. and N.” section, retailing
Tod’s witty retorts to the Judge. The Judge,
however, had the last word, and Tod went in, to
the evident joy of the 17 policemen, and the ill-
concealed annoyance of the Pentridge warders.
He was far from popular with those who had met
him.
Few men, however, fail entirely of favor in the
eyes of woman. This is really a scathing com-
mentary on woman, but we will not argue the
matter. Maggie Elder loved Tod good and hard,
and Tod simply worshipped Maggie. Anybody
could see this by the way he knocked her about.
A man does not break a girl’s head nor jump on
her unless tender relations exist between them.
Between ordinary acquaintances this sort of thing
would be rude. Unhappily—this is where one
becomes really shocked—Maggie’s union had not
received the sanction of the matrimonial agent.
The' two lived in mortal sin. So the Rev.
Joseph Jellicoe did not call upon him, and
the very best families in Kyte’s Lane and
Bilker’s Alley did not include Maggie on
their visiting lists. The wages of sin—cheap
sin, bereft of diamonds and champagne—is
social death. Mrs. Ah Cow, who had her ring
and license, did well to avoid association with
Maggie. She would have also done well to have
avoided it with Cow, but that point escaped her.
Tod had finished his sentence, had come out to
find that his father had been dead for over a year,
and had worried the life out of Father Roche to
make the old man as easy in Purgatory as it is
possible to be in such an unpleasant climate.
Not because he himself troubled about religion,
but his father had been a good Catholic, and Tod
would see that he got a fair deal. He.had kept
out of gaol for over three months. This is not to
say that he did not deserve gaol. He kept out
because the star sleuth Of the C.I. could not find
a clue to the thief who put up the jewel robbery
in Collins-street. One cannot blame the detective,
since Tod was a good deal cleverer in thieving
than the detective was in detecting.
Then came the affair of Mr. William Muggs.
William wasastupid old gentleman who was fond of
ladies, and stayed out late at night when he should
have been in bed. He had jiist parted from two
ladies and three sovereigns when Tod, noticing
his air of wealth and respectability, grabbed
him by the throat and squeezed till his
eyes bulged out like a lobster’s. Then he
was laid gently down and his remaining
mone}’, amounting to a little over £3, his watch,
his gold-rimmed spectacles and his pearl scarf-
pin were transferred to Tod’s pocket, while he
tried to get enough air back into his lungs to yell
for the police. 1 Before he had sufficient for even
a quarter of a yell, Tod had finished and left. JL lie
authorities gave the case to a new young detective,
and Tod, after three days, was arrested “purely
upon description,” as the fresh roundsman para-
graphed it next morning. The only thing that
really annoyed Maggie in the affair was that she
could not find out what Tod had done with the
money. She had searched his clothes, and
inquired at the public-house opposite. And
when she went to see Tod at the watch-house
he refused to say a word about it. He went
up for trial, and in for two years with
some trimmings in the way of “solitary.” But
he kept his mouth shut on the subject of the
money. Maggie became curious, and jealous.
He had not spent it decently on drink—it must
have gone to another woman. Alas, how unfit was
she to be the mate of Tod Maguire ! How could
she appreciate the magnificent absurdity of what
he had actually done? When she found out, she
went and got drunk with Ah Cow, who did not
share his wife’s narrow view of the ethics of
marriage.
“Now, ’tis the funniest t’ing Oi iver sthruck,”
said Constable Hogan to the City Court reporter.
“Ould Muggs was robbed on th’ Choosd’y, an’ on
We’nsd’y Oi was on jooty at th’ Cimithry, where
they was plantin’ould Sir Jawn Bow-clerk wid
great pomp an’ ceremony. Who sh’d Oi see but
Misther Maguire, sailin’ along, ahl in dacint
black, an’ wid a lovely choiney wrea,t’ thot must
’v cost two-pound-tin. Yis—he did in ivery bane
he’d got fr’m Muggs to buy a wreat’ to put on ms
father’s grave. Did you’s iver hear th’ loike.
The City Court reporter chewed his pen
gloomily. “No good now,” he said. ‘ y by
the blazes didn’t you give it me at the time .
HASSAN.
Our Kid Wants to Talk.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OUR kid to deep despair it brings
That, though he knows a million
things
That he himself has found out,
He can’t get the right sound out.
He knows so much ; but though
He tries to tell us all the day,
Somehow he cannot find the way ;
And, though the art of talking
Sounds easier than walking,
The words he doesn’t .know !
He understands, so ’cute he’s grown,
A little language all his own—
A kind of Baby-Latin
He dearly loves to chat in,
And only he can use ;
And in that esoteric tongue,
That seems to need a lot of lung,
And much gesticulation,
All day with animation
He tells himself the news.
He talks to everything he sees—
To chairs and ferry-boats and trees ;
And. he makes them long orations ;
They like these conversations —
They understand so well !
But when, to his supreme surprise,
The things they’ve told to him he tries
To tell to us, translating,
He finds—most irritating !
They are so hard to tell!
And when we talk, his owlish gaze
Upon our faces almost says :
“I understand you—nearly.
Why can't you speak more clearly ?
And then, I do not see
What need there is for things like words ?
They say all sorts of things—the birds !
But what grown-ups call speaking
To my ears sounds like squeaking !
Why can’t you talk like me?”
And sometimes he will strangely stare
Far off—l’m sure there’s nothing there
And yet—oh, evidently
He’s listening intently
To something that they say !
And then his sudden, distant smile !
It makes me think that all.the while
He knows some language other
Than that of Dad or Mother—
But who... or what... are They ?
