SATURDAY, JULY 31. 1886.
Thbrb are few historical writers of equal
vigour whose works and words require to
be received with the same caution and
weighed with the same judgment as those of
Mr. James Anthony Froudb. In spite of
his felicitous diction, the reader turns from
his biassed pages to seek in those of H Ann am
and others the impartiality of which Mr.
Froddb is such a persistent enemy. Ac-
cording to him, the Celt is Humanity’s
enfant terrible. The Irish branch, particu-
larly, of this disagreeable family, is the
blackest sheep in a black flock. The French-
man, composed of three-fourths Celt, with a
veneer of Teuton, has, no doubt, done some-
thing for human progress. The Welsh and
Highland offshoots have had at least the
good sense to keep civil and not make too
much noise. But the Irish Ishmael has his
hand against most men—especially when
they appear in the form of landlords or
tithe-proctors—and so must expect to have
many hands against him. To Mr. Froudb
and those who think with him it is inexplic-
able—except on the basis of racial inferiority
—that the Munster peasant should continue
ragged and turbulent when for hundreds of
years so many inducements have been
pressed upon him to wear decent clothes
and become law-abiding. His lands have
been stolen, his faith proscribed, his kins-
men banished or hanged, his women
ravished, and yet the ingrate is sullen and
d ssatiefled. The fault is in the race—yes, it
is clearly in the race.

The latest word of warning from the
Writer who discovered something agreeable
to say about Henry YIII., is in the form of
a letter to an American who, with the pro-
verbial curiosity of his nation, had asked
him to “ state shortly what he thought of
the Irish business.” He states it, and every
sentence bears the trade-mark of the author
of the “ English in Ireland.” Mr. Froudb
accuses the Irish of having four times tried
to turn the Anglo-Saxon out of the country.
We believe there is a good deal of truth in
this, and it goes to show how injudicious it
h, when a burglar breaks into your house,
to endeavour to eject him, unless you are
quite sure you are able. It is, on the whole,
far safer to invite him to make himself at
home —particularly when he intends doing
so, whether you invite him or not. But of
all the droll reasons for denying local
government to a people, the drollest per-
haps is, because their ancestors revolted in
centuries gone by. For hundreds of years
the Britons struggled against the Saxons;
for hundreds more the Saxons rose in un-
availing fury against the Normans. Men
who have not reached middle age have seen
Hungarians and Italians rise against Aus-
trians. The slave-holders rebelled against
the Union, but when they were put down
and restored, the refractory States got back
their rights—with the exception of the right
to trade in human flesh—as if no split had
ever occurred. The idea of reconciling
people to a standing injustice is peculiarly
shortsighted. Tou may exterminate, but
you can never reconcile.

“ Tills only Is to me clear that the two races be-
tween whom Ireland is divided will not be able
henceforward to live together there. If England
decides to uphold the Union, the native Irish will
not bear another disappointment, and will go
as so many of them have gone already. If the
Dublin Parliament is set up with control of the
Executive and supreme over ;tho four pro-
vinces, Protestant Ulster will refuse to submit.
. . The Ulster men [under certain circum-
stances] will gather their property together and
move off ... to some distant colony, which
they will assist Into Independence as their great
grandfathers assisted the Amerioar s.”
Such are Mr. Froude’s opinions. We be-
lieve them tobe demonstrably unsound. Itis
just as hard to tell by sight an Irish Prott s-
tant from an Irish Romanist as to tell a
Lowlander from a Highlander. It is not
racial but religious jealousies fanned by
rival priests that keep the people apart.
When the Catholic becomes as tolerant as
his French co-religionist and the Protestant
as his German one, we shall have heard the
last of racial incompatibility. This tme is
not so distant as some imagine, and v ould
have arrived long ago but for the sacerdotal
fire-brands to whom bigotry isthelreath
of life. But suppose that every Celt left

Ireland to-morrow carrying with him his
religion and his hate; that the whole
“Irishry ” with their priests, their pigs, and
their rags passed away for ever. One of the
first things the Irish Protestants would do
would be to agitate for local Government.
It is not love of centralization bub fear, or
affected fear, of Romanism that makes the
Ulster man repudiate Home Rule. Let him
but have the Island to himself to-morrow
and a Parliament would quickly follow. It
war from the bosom of Northern Presby-
terianism that some of 'England’s fiercest
enemies came. If Irish Papists swarmed in
French brigades and checked the British
arms at Fontenoy, Irish Presbyterians, as
Mr. Fboude allows, swarmed across the At-
lantic to assist in humbling their old op-
pressors at Saratoga and York Town.
If Cromavell, instead of massacrting half
the Irish Celts, hadbutrcmainedsufflciently
lorg in the country to finish the work and
destroy all, things would hare gone on well
for a while—but only for a while. The de-
scendants of the English and Scotch settlers
would call themselves “Irishmen,” develope
a distinct nationality, and, long before
Grattan's time, demand a separation more
or less complete. Persons of Mr. Froudb’b
school do not appear to understand this
question of national sentiment, and so
handle it clumsily. But they would under-
stand it if, say, England and France formed
one kingdom with the seat of Government
at Paris ; if the citizens of London could not
build a bridge nor dig a canal without leave
from the central administration; and if
Frenchcffioiala, difhring in religion and race
from the people they ruled, were to be found
from Cornwall to Cumberland. Imagine
such a set of circumstances. Go further,
and imagine the French planting colonies in
the Island, proscribing the reformed religion
and punishing with merbiltss severity the
inevitable risings. Suppose the Englishman
exterminated or forced across the sea. What
would the result be? Why, that the
descendants of the victorious Gauls would
become Englishmen as the descendants of
British selthrs became Americans, and in
the process of time demand self-govern-
ment. We in Australia see this decentral-
ising tendency in full work. Victoria and
Queensland separated from the parent pro-
vince; there is a movement on foot to drive
a wedge into Queensland; and Western
Australia’s time will come when she gets
sufficiently populous. Yet, to their shame
be it said, many of those who in Victoria
and Queensland vehemently clamoured for
self-rule oppose with discreditable incon-
sistency a similar demand from four millions
of people.
* * •
“ The Irish,” Mr. Froude continues, “ are an
unchanging people, . . . In their t fiforts against
England, Spain, France, the Pope, or whoever It
might be, found constant allies in the Irish. , . .
It was Indispensable to us to keep our enemies out
of Ireland. . . , Where they (the English and
Scotch settlers) have been there has been order
and peace, and prosperity. The rest of Ireland
has remained in beggary and raggedness.”
And yet the settlers who established that
peace and prosperity fled in thousands to
bear arms against the Government undtr
which those blessings had been enjoyed.
Men frequently expatriate themselves
through being unable to secure sufficient
food and clothes. It is a new thing to hear
of their leaving through having too much
of both. The Irish are, no doubt, unchang-
ing—notably in their determination to get
back their stolen liberty. But their beggary
and raggedness are soon changed to well-
being under favourable conditions. If for
centuries you treat a people with barbarous
inhumanity, it is surely the height of folly
to expect them to be industrious and culti-
vated. Hear a great American writer—
Hbnrt George—on the subjects—
“lt is difficult for one who has been looking
over the literature of Irish misery, as while
writing this chapter I have been doing, to speak
In decorous terms of the complacent attribution
of Irish want and suffering to over-population*
which are to be found even in the works cf such
high minded men as Minn and BuOklb. I know
of nothing better 1 calculated to make the blood
boil than the cold accounts of the grasping, grind-
ing tyranny to which the Irish people have been
tubjected, and to which Irish pauperism and Irish
famine are to be attributed. It was the same
remorselees repacity that robbed the Indian ryot
of the fruits of his toll and left him to starve
where Nature offered plenty. . . It was not the
Imprudence * of Irish peasants,’ as English econo-
mists coldly say, which induced them to make the
potato the staple of their food. Irish emigrants,
when they can get other things, do not live upon
the potato, and certainly In the United States the
prudence of the Irish character In endeavouring
to lay something by for a rainy day Is remark-
able. Are rot pauperism and starvation necessary
consequences in a land where the producers ©£
wealth are compelled to work under conditions
which deprive them of hope, of self-respect, of
energy, of thrift; where absentee landlords drain
away, without return, at least a fourth of the net
produce of the soil, and when, besides them, a
starving industry must support resident landlords,
with their horses and hounds, agents, jobbers,
middlemen, and bailiffs . . an army of police-
men and soldiers to overawe and hunt down any
opposition to the iniquitous system ?”
And yet, in spite of all these privileges, to
think that the Celtic Irish are still steeped
in raggedness, beggary andunchangeability I
Truly a remarkable people.

“ The Nationalist movement is a repetition
of the same attempts which have been four
litres made already to rid Ireland of the
Anglo-Scotch settlers.” This is a specimen
of the wild assertion made by Mr. Froddb
Yet it would be safe to say that, if a Parlia-
ment satin Dublin to-morrow, thousands of
the armed forces of the country would be
put in motion if necessary to protect the
humblest Angio-Soot-Iruh colonist from in-
sult or wrong. But no such necessity would
arise. Because an Irish Parliament 200
years ago endeavoured to recover land re-
cently and wronfully confiscated, Mr.
Froddb argues that a Parliament of to-day
would endeavour to reinstate the descend-
ants of the old possessors of eight-generations
ago. This is positively puerile. The com-
mon-sense of mankind has long since recog-
nised the necessity for a law of limitations.
The idea of Parnell himself—an Anglo
Irish Protestant—and his followers, repu-
diating tenures of two centuries is groles-

Washington when Lna surrendered, he
would have hanged dozens of the leading

Capital and Trades’-Unionism.
tVORKMBN walking: in procession through the
Streets at midday, and assembling in public halls
at night to discuss plans of future operations, tel]
that Labour is engaged in one of its many lights.
It is the brlokmakers in and around Sydney who
ate at present on strike. The number of men ou
of employment is not great, although a brie
master announced lately that unless the me
gave in building throughout the city and suburb
would quickly come to a standstill, and mason
Carpenters, and other unionists would be at llbert
to traverse the streets with the original proce
slonists. What the men want in this partlcula
case is to have eight hours taken as a workln
day. The employers who refuse do not do
absolutely, but present conditions which the me
decline to accept. What these conditions are, an
what may be said in favour of or against th
grounds on which they rest, we do not here pu
pose to discuss. The question that concerns us
the general one. It is trades’-unionism and capita
that have met, and, once more parted, foes. Capit
regards Labour as dictatorial, and Labour impute
traditional hostility to Capital.
• ♦ *
There was a time when Capital possessed grea
advantages. It could on such occasions set Law
at Labour. Gradually, however, the teeth of Law
have been drawn. To-day, except in cases of phy
sical violence, which are extremely rare and nee
not be referred to here, the battle is fought o
argumentative lines and with the aid of sue
moral machinery as each side can provide. Arb
tration is rising as the new mediating power. It
effectiveness will depend on the soundness of it
knowledge of principles. Whatever may be th
particular source of a strike the general object
of labour organisations enter into the contro
versy. If these be stated in an unfriendly way
they overshadow the points at issue. It was a
throughout the strike at the Lambton colliery
during the masons’ strike at Manly, and in almosi;
every other strike as well as the present. It is
therefore, of first importance that the principle
which underlie these general objects should be
understood. Several of them, it must he con
fessed, appear to militate against reason. Take
the rule Unions lay down, that, where piece-work
Is not followed, the quick and slow man shall re
eeive the same wages. As a matter of abstract
and individual right, this is indefensible. Bu;
that Is not the ground to j udge it from. The alter-
native before the Union is to let men chase each
other under the eye of an employer. Who is to
judge what a fair degree of expedition is ? No!;
the individual, whether workman or employer
If the one, the slowest might be made the type; if
the other, the quickest. In the large workshops
of Manchester and Birmingham, men used, before
Unions took the subject up, to enter on each day’s
work as a race for life. The slower men were
systematically weeded out. Victory, however,
was only nominally to the swiftest. The race had
to be kept up. In the meantime, the slower men,
driven out of the door of rapid work, came back
by the door of lower wages. The maximum of
speed was met by the minimum of remuneration.
Where were the swift men then? It became
manifest that there was no use in trying to main-
tain a common rate of wages unless a common rate
of speed was taken as its measure.
* ♦ *,
Another principle of Unionism, as irrational
when taken as an abstract proposition, is, that
which objects to men working overtime. There
are circumstances in which the objection is not
urged, but it is part of the system. Capital says
that a limit should not be placed to a man’s in-
dustry. It points out, moreover, that the attempt
to put a limit fails, as the man, after all, may work
after quitting the workshop. Thus, the Union
makes a miner lay his tools down when he has
worked eight hours in a mine. But when he
goes home he may take up a saw and hammer and
build an additional room to his house. Put, this
way, there appears to be no difference between
working eight hours at mining and two houra at
carpentering, and working ten hours at mining.
From the standpoint of the man’s Union there is,
however, great difference. Take the case of the
Sydney briekmakers. If twenty million bricks are
wanted in a week and the men cannot keep up to
the demand, working overtime is allowable. The
more Industrious, or rather the men whpse in-
dustry takes the direction of keeping on at one
kind of work, are permitted by the Union to offer
themselves for extra hours. But if there bo men
enough in the place to do within regular hours the
amount of work required, the man who works
more than a man’s share is taking part of another
man’s share away. Four briekmakers who work
two hours a day extra throw—on the assumption
that there is a full supply of men in the market—a
fellow-briekmaker out of employment. The
money earned by such men Is called in the guild
*' blood-money.” The term is a strong one, but it
is not inapplicable.
• * •
Each Union regards the work it concerns itself
With as having, at any given time, measurable
dimensions. In the general run of things it is
found that there are enough men for all the work
that wants to be done. This is the strength of
every Union’s position on the subject of over-
time. Work is like land. The labourer is no more
entitled to grab work ad libitum than is the land-
grabber to seize land. Work is diffused through
the State for the livelihood of all. Each Union
distributes its portion so as to give the individuals
under It a fair share each. If it be contended that j
one labourer bas the moral fight to take away as i
much of this portion as he likes, then we have
only to suppose him endowed with sufficient
strength and he will have moral liberty to take the
whole of the portion. We can suppose him thus
doing all the work and letting the rest of the craft
stand idle. When there’s a rush of work there is,
as we said, no objection—at least no organised
objection—to doing overtime. But it is not dis-
guised that there is in this an element of serious
danger to the cause Unionism strives for. Next
to insufficient work, work Irregularly inflated is
the greatest bane. The inflation is often due to
purely speculative enterprise. Temporarily a
factory finds itself fllled with orders. Elsewhere*
consequently, there is a depletion. The spirit that
lifts Trades-Unionis'm from petty cliquelsm to a
position of sovereign Influence, is that It looks
not to the man of a shop only, but to all the men
of the guild. Regular employment within regular
hours, over the whole field, is better for men of
any trade than day and night work for a while at
one spot, and no work, or little, at another. It is
not necessary, however, to argue for more than
Unions at present actually demand. Equal wages
for quick and slow men, and the limitation of the
hours of labour, have then, it is seen, each two
aspects, under one of which the demands appear re-
pugnant to reason, while under the other they are
only repugnant to capital. It is so with other
claims labour puts forward.

One straight charge levelled against Trades-
Unionism is that it is selfish. The charge seems
true. It is proven by the fact that when It strikes
it studies only its own time. But what is the
character of the foroe'with which it is contend-
ing? Trades-Unionism represents the selfishness
of a class, but capital represents the selfishness of
an individual. There is a vast difference there.
Under the one, individuals often sacrifice them-
selves in the interests of their weaker fellows.
The system has power, because of this spirit of
self-sacrifice. Under the other, the individual is
all in all. He puts his money into large buildings,
he gathers in orders from every quarter, he calls
on his workmen and starts his machinery, and
just then a deputation waits on him and demands
a concession. It is natural for him to feel that
he is a victim. But he should reflect that the
science of Political Economy, as expounded by
his class, has made the relation between employer
and employed a game of catch-who-catch-can. If
business grows dull, he does not hesitate to shut
up a branch or the whole place for a year. If by
machinery he can dispense with half his men, he
does it without scruple. The fact that families
had shifted their habitations into his vicinity does
not concern him. That was their risk. Well, then,
when he employs them, he should remember that
that is his risk. The motives on neither side are
high, but they are not so low on the side of Labour
as to merit a moral lecture from Capital.
♦ * «
Were things as they should be, there would be
no conflict between Labour and Capital. One
would be the right hand and the other the left of
progress and prosperity. Christianity began with
the ennobling of Labour. Prom being the degra-
dation of slaves it became the vocation of free-
men. Who will not work shall not eat was set up
as a primary law. Every monastery had its
grounds to till, every layman had his trade to
follow. Peter had his net for the sea, and Paul
his pack-needle for the white tents of Tarsus, and
He who taught them had His basket of carpenter’s
tools for the bench in Nazareth. While com-
munity of goods prevailed, there was health. But
as Christian communism declined, the body of
society reverted to its Pagan state. Wealth became
localised and Labour degraded. No longer did the
hand grip the tools in obedience to a high com-
mand and in recognition of a sacred duty. The
command was seen Issuing from lips pursed with
the pride of money, and duty presented itself as
the naked barbarism of procuring food for the
stomach. Time deepened these characteristics.
At last all traces of Christian communism were
utterly obliterated. Labour sank to Its nadir and
wealth rose to its zenith. The one had lost Its
rights;, the other had surrounded its rights with
barriers of stolen privileges. Then, however, a
stronger influence than that derived from written
law began to stir. It was Humanity. Eights, in-
herent rights, not concessions from higher realms,
showed themselves as visions. Labour looked up.
By taking one another’s hands, the trampled mil-
lions would be able to stand. They reached out,
they clutched, they clasped. Such was the genesis
of Trades’-unlonism. Looking back into the past
one marvels at the speed it has made. Looking
forward, one thinks oneself almost on the threshold
of a new world.

Oblique Review.
That title is about as obscure as the term “ oblique
morality,” which had place recently In the Dally
Press. It conveys our meaning, however, which
Is the peculiar review made by the Dally Press In
Sydney of the teaching and preaching of the Daily
Press in London. The Daily Press of Sydney
kicked up a big row recently about the New
Hebrides, and asserted, among other things equally
false and calumnious, that the unanimous voice
of Australia was in favour of Australian annexa-
tion, and that France, despite all treaties and pro-
mises to the contrary, really had annexed. Events
have proved the last assertion to be simply a lie,
while, as to the former, there is nothing in its
favour beyond the statements of the papers them-
selves and a few rabid pulpit utterances, which, if
reprinted in the French papers, would make more
mirth on the boulevards that in the tents of the un-
godly in Sydney. But the daily payers filled them-
selves full of the matter, and took themselves home
and passed themselves off as Public Opinion in the
newspaper offices of London. The result being
that the Times and the Standard say that the
existing treaty must be respected (Prance, so far,
has respected it very strictly); and that Austra-
lian sentiment seems to be in favour of Australia i
supremacy in Pacific waters. Th’s is right and
reasonable enough, but why should the daily
papers of Sydney straightway set up the Standard
and Times as high authority on the matter?
What possible chance can the writers cn these I
papers have of gauging the Australian opinion on ■
the matter ? How could they get at the facta but
from the papers they received ? And how much
more probable is it that they would have sound
information and formed accurate opinions on
such a matter as Australian borrowing ? Yet In
the Herald and Telegraph offices neither
Times nor Standard is regarded as Sir Oracle
about that.

The King of Bavaria and the Boctor.
The King murdered the doctor; there is not the
slightest doubt about it now. The marks of his
long, gorilla-like fingers were In the little savant's
throat and on his arm. All the upper part of hl d
face was bruised and smashed; the King had
struck him to stop his clamour—probably he
dragged him out through the shallows. The Devij
entered into the King—the beast-spirit, the in-
herited savagedom, we mean; the impulse of some
old monster of the forest moved beneath his hairy
breast, and impelled his sinewy arms of more than
human length. He was not a man; he should
have been shut in a cage or shot down at sight.
He was no more to be trusted than a tiger or
gorilla. But he was a King. And so he wa B
allowed to murder the doctor in the last act as he
had been permitted to play the greatest fool’s
game the world ever saw with the accumulated
earnings of a hundred thousand peasants, for a
quarter of a century. And what did they do with
the carrion, the two hundredweight of brute flesh
foul with murder when they had dragged it from
the lake ? The doctors handled it first, and found
the brain diseased, found that the man had as
clearly committed mental suicide as any slobber-
ing imbecile of a criminal asylum. It was not a
decent soul-case.they were handling but the foul
sepulchre of a nasty spirit. Yet what did they do
with it ? Is it not sickening to read of it, the
embalming, the dressing, the floor covered with
roses, and pure white camelias, violets, and nar-
cissus heaped on the coffin-lid ? Servitors, cour-
tiers, lords, and ladies mourning around, and
within the box a thing that would justify a quota-
tion of Tennyson’s mad lines. Literally and
truthfully one of
“ The dragons of the prime
Who tear each other in their slime.”
But still a king. And the murdered doctor was
shut up in a plain black box and decently burled,
let us hope.

The Lord’s Day.
In a quiet and respectable way, a dirtier and
meaner thing never was than the Sydney Echo’s
fling at the Sunday concerts. Through about 30
weak lines and a half-dozen silly sentences, the
Echo tries to make it clear that Sunday concerts
are against the law of the land, and the will of the
majority, and ought therefore to be suppressed.
And is not the Sunday preparation of the Mon-
day’s paper—the pursuing by editor, reporter, and
compositor, of their customary avocations on the
Lord’s Day, against the law of the land ? Why do
the Echo proprietors pander to the vile tastes of
a godless multitude, and compel their work-
people to break the fourth commandment, In
order that the S.M.H. may be served with break-
fast on Monday ? As to the will of the majority,
the parties la power whose political existence
depends upon that will, are probably far better
informed than the Echo, and they do not seem
Inclined to go back a couple of hundred years
for unreasonable law to restrain this very reason-
able liberty. The truth is, the Sunday secular
concerts in the halls are Just a little better than
the Sunday sacred concerts in the churches, and,
therefore, more popular. And as for sin in the
matter, well, it is sweet, and apparently innocuous
sin; and If all who indulge in it read the Echo by
way of penance, on Monday, their Judgment Day
account will stand pretty square.

The Tory Triumph.
Lord Salisbury’s acceptance of the English
Premiership, if he really be courageous enough to
meet Parliament with such supporters as he can
muster, will be a return with more of humiliation
than triumph in Its nature. Only two courses are
open to him by which ha can maintain a majority.
Either he must “dish the Whigs” by adopting
their policy, which he has so strongly denounced,
or else he must be a mere negation in politics.
Adopting the latter alternative his administration
will exist on the strength of its forbearances.
Though he has defeated Gladstone’s plan of
autonomy for Ireland, he dare not, as we pointed
out last week, try to enforce his own views in
favour of Coercion. His Cabinet will retain its
place on sufferance, and its highest energies will
be devoted to the work of retraining from offend-
ing those members whose support must neces-
sarily be precarious and uncertain. For many
reasons the advent of a Conservative Ministry
will be of great benefit to the Liberal party, and
not the least so because it will then be seen how
great indignity the Tories will suffer in order to
obtain an unhonoured lease of power.

"The Queen has been pleased to accept the Resignation of Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues."—Recent Cablegrams.


The gooly and peaceful little town of Gee-
long has been thrown into an excited frame of
mind by the capture of another monster shark in
Corlo Bay. Tnls last gentleman is 18ft. 4in. in
length, and is confidently believed to have died a

Gilbert, the English cricketer, lately sent
to gaol for stealing: money from cricketers’ clothes
In a pavilion, was never suspected of such things
when ho was in Australia. He Is a cousin of the
Graces and the disgrace of the family.
“Baron Huddleston,” says the SM.
Herald, "has Just successfully undergone a
serious operation. ’ We suppose the Baron has
had cut from his brain the bigotry convolution
which made so disgraceful an exhibition of him in
the blasphemy cases.
At Cairns (Q.) a picture of Premier Griffith
has been hung up in the Council-chambers “as a
mark of loyalty.” Prom his appearance It is
generally thought that he was oleographed just
after eating two and a-half underdone pigs at the
recent local banquet.
Another of Charles Dickens’ sons, F. J.
Dickens, died at Moline, Illionios, on June 11, from
paralysis of the heart. His brother is land-valuer,
and is stationed at Wllcannla, N.8.W., where is
also the son of Antony Trollope, who Is chairman
of the local land board.

Captain Gerald Finch-Hatton, a high-
toned British loafer, who appeared among the
evil-smelling “drunks” at Brisbane recently,
said it was monstrous of colonial cads to permit
a gentleman to descend to such a state of impe-
eunloslty. This haughty scion of a noble house
was discharged after the impudent magistrate had
cautioned him.
The lawyers, we know, love to twine their
clients round their fingers, and have them on a

It is the thread of his discourse,.
•A Northern solicitor brought a charge of
wilful and corrupt perjury against a barrister.
Of course the case was dismissed. It was too pre-
posterous. If a legal gentleman can't lie, he must
necessarily toddle off to gaol as a creature “with-
out any visible means of subsistence ” And prison
atmosphere is tainted enough now. Heaven knows
That “popular educator,” the Town and

that Marshal Ney was shot by orders of Napoleon

cause. Mr. Samuel Bennett, the founder of the

be hoped that his eldest son will never write a
history of France.
Alderman Either, of Adelaide, is giving a
dinner to 1000 children of the East End of London.
We don’t know Either, and don’t seem to want to.
But we would like to know how many children he
ever fed in Adelaide? We hope to learn that
there are no hungry children in Adelaide, and
that the alderman would decline a dukedom if
offered one—to say nothing of a C.M.G.-ship.
Judge Bouoaut, of the 9.A. Supreme Court,
will, it is said, resign and again plunge into politics.
The judge gets only JEITOO a year (too much for the
work there has been lately), and the Government
propose to reduce that to about £l3OO or £l4OO
under the new system of graduated reductions of
civil service “screws.” It would hardly pay Mr
Boucaut to remain upon the Bench at that wage.
When Baron Maclay performed his won-
derful exploit of crossing New Guinea, the niggers
became troublesome, and he told them that as a
punishment to them he would darken the moon
on the following night. At the exact time he in-
dicated, a great black cloud blotted out the moon
and the natives were awed and respectful ever
after. The baron had with him an almanac which
noted eclipses.
The Princess Beatrice is expected to give

“ I didn’t think Lard Cariogton was so

your “three bob” at the pigeon-hole, and remain in
a pleasing state of doubt as to who is going to get

the same when a parson snuffles that “the pmyers
of the congregation are desired for a lady who is
seriously ill.” You flop down on your knees and

The physician, Dr. R.Schuette, who healed
so many others, was unable to heal himself. The
oible relates that he died on the rich Inst, from the
effects of an operation to which he had submitted
in the hope of obtaining freedom from a liver-
affection which had long oppressed him. For 11
years he was honorary surgeon to St. Vincent’s
Hospital, Sydney, but resigned when leaving for
Germany three years ago to place himself under
treatment in order to obtain relief from his
ojbscure malady. The news of his death has been
regretfully received by all whom he ever attended
In his professional capacity, as well as by his
friends In the medical and social world. Dr
Schuette was an accomplished and enthusiastic
surgeon—one out of the half-dozen poBB“ssed by
Australia.
In a certain Queensland town lives a fat
planter who periodically goes on a regulation
"burst.” Seme years ago he was Just starting
on a glorious spree in town when a new-chutn
policeman, unconscious of the fact that the
offender was a J.P., arrested him, and with some
trouble lodged him in the local “ Jug.” Next
morning, when our drunken Justice came to his
senses, he was released by the sergeant, who
apologised for causing his worship such annoyance
but as the charge was filed, however, the J.P. had
to appear in court and answer the summons. None
of the local magistrates attending, our head-sore
dispenser of Justice mounted the bench, and, seat-
Ingr himself, called out, “Regina versus A.B ’
(mentioning his own name). Looking around the
court, he exclaimed with great solemnity, ‘ As
tnere is no appearance of Regina, 1 dismiss the
case. The court stands adjourned.”
Vanity Fair on Lord Rosebery“Lord
Koseberry Is a sharp, clever young man. not
ni £® t®® 1108- ! or over rich ln scru-
pl©s, wno looks only to his own personal
career, and who has backed Mr. Gladstone
because he believed that to be the way to a
quick and groat career. Just as he went into
racing 1 merely to get his name into the newspapers,
just as he would have pledged his life for the
money that would enable him to make a figure in
the world, so he planked down all his ready clerer-
ness on Mr. Gladstone in the belief that he would
thus best aid and further the career of Lord Rose-
bery, because Mr. Gladstone stood highest in the
betting. There is nothing more-and nothing less
—in Lord Rosebery than this.” The same high-
Tory authority describes Mr. Childers as “ vain,
pompous, a confirmed toady of Mr. Gladstone,
and an insatiate office-seeker, office-keeper, and
pensioner. fl« lives but by Mr. Gladstone, and
under Mr. Gladstone’s shadow alone can thrive,
and as he never had any ascertainable principles
of public policy he has not had to abandon any.”

‘ Some men are born for great things,”
but it Is not often that a man rises to the eminent
position of a chief justice because the weather
was too cold to allow of him being a clerk of petty
sessions. Sir Jimes Prendergast, of New Zealand,
started his colonial careeras C P.S. at Maryborough
(Vlo.) la the early days, and immediately after his
accession the authorities at Melbourne began to
be worried by the receipt of sheets of foolscap
covered with cuneiform Inscriptions and footed
by a signature that looked like a fight between a
spider and a gridiron, at first, little notice was
taken of the matter, it being concluded that the
documents were copies of Belshazzar’s washing-
bill, or something of the kind, which had gone
??4 ray * S. Dd they wcre simply re-directed to “ Pest
Office, Babylon ; to be left till called for,” and
passed on. At length, however, the trouble be-
came too great for human endurance, and It being
clscoyered that tbe Illegible sorrows in question
issued from Maryborough, a commission of
mqulry was sent up. They found that Mr.
Prendergast’s office consisted of an old Govern-
ment tent pitched on a mud bank, the flooring
consisting of one inch of water and three of Irish
bog, and as it was the depth of winter and bitterly
cola a little ice lent variety to the scene. Inside
this cloth mansion a benumbed clerk of petty
sessions was making pot-hooks and hangers m his
official capacity as a member of the Civil service,
his st ffened fingers rendering it impossible to pro-
duce anything more legible. The Commission, as
In duty bound, inspected and reported on the blue-
nosed officer, but they did not take extenuating
circumstances into account in these days, and Mr.
Prendergast recuved his dismissal. His early
ambition being thus nipped in the bud he took to
the law for consolation, and is now a Chief Justice
with a title and a gas-stovo Instead of a bush
Dogberry in a leaky tent. His story should point
a valuable moral to young men who are unable to
write decently In cold weather.

Louise, at Kensington palace, was a member of the

Tb® mayor he sat in his robes of state.
With a rubicund face and a gllst’nlng pate;
His heart throbbed fast and his pulse beat high.
His lips were blanched and his tongue was dry.
And he cried, “ Oh I what will that answer be I
Shall I die a knight or a C.M.G ?”
A boy oh the beach at Manly played
With a little pail and a wooden spade:
But when he had dug the sands awhile.
In a weary, strange, abstracted style,
He, too, sat down and remarked “Ah, me!
What, 01 what will the answer be?’’
The matron arrayed in rich raiment rare.
Lolled back at ease in her lounging-chair.
And murmured, “Down, fluttering heart I keep
still.
Whom will he take for the first quadrille ?
Shall I have the bliss to be vi8-a~vis?
W hat will His Highness’s answer be ?”
The Member of Parliament, smiling and sleek.
Thought, “ Will He drop in when I m going to
speak ?”
And the maiden she twiddled her little pink
thumbs,
Sighing, “ How shall I look when His Highness
comes ?”
’Twas the topic at dinner and afternoon-tea,
What would His Highness’s answer be ?
Plain Bill he prepared an Imperial speech,-
The parson a suitable sermon to preach ;
The dudes on the " block” had a mystified alf
(They wondered what neckties His Highness would
wear);
Burdett, too—oh I no one so happy as he,
As he prattles of Bertie and glories to be.
The papers appeared with their sorrowful tale,
And the small boy at Manly Indulged in a wall;
The Mayor, all disconsolate, plays with his chain;
The matron will never be happy again;
The member he skulks with a scowl to his place;
The maiden is hiding her dear little face;
I lain Bill, dudes, Burdett and the parson are
dumb—
For the cable has told ’em the Prince cannot come.

He was a sturdy colonist, who loathed all social
sham,
Who mocked the glided upper-ten and couldn’t
bear their “jam;”
It mattered not to him a bit how other swells were
dressed,
He only pleased himself, and wore the tile that
suited best.
That forest black of chlmney-pols he looked upon
with scorn
(His special style of beauty chimney-pots did not
adorn).
And possibly (perchance ’twas hot) he saw no
reason why
A chap should sport a collar, or be stifled with a
tie.
A long frock coat, and trousers tight, and other
fal-de-rals,
He rightly deemed ’em vanities wherewith to
“mash” the gals;
And as for gloves, why, bless your ’artl he’d never
worn ’em yet—
The symbols they of “goin’ farst and gettln’ inter
debt.”
A bowler-’at was good enough for any king or
queen,
So long as he’d got somethin’ on, why, that was al

He was a sturdy colonist, who loathed all soshal

And as for what the people thort—he didn’t care a

Of lips “red as cherries,” and eyes “black as

Of forms “like Diana’s,” and “soft, wreathing

We’ve longed for a lock that was “softer than

" I am all alone in my chamber now,
And the midnight hour is near,
And the faggots’ crack and the clock’s dull tick

For my heart and my ryes are full when I think
Of my dear husband, who departedfor a better

POOR MAN
We wish you luck, unhappy Charles,
And trust that story quite *' washed
la spite of your traducer’s snarls
We'll look on you as white-washed;
One can’t pass judgment now, you know,
On things you did so long ago.
Most men are giddy in their youth,
A little wild and reckless,
Who in their middle age, forsooth,
Are spoken of as spechless ;
Why even we, good man alive 1
Wore indiscreet in “ seventy-five.”
That story which the wife disclosed,
So full of sad sensation,
Was (as we always had supposed)
A frenzied fabrication.
No doubt she only dreamt, poor child,
That ‘‘Charley ” was a little wild.
Henceforth the world will close its ears
To whispers meant to hurt you—
Suffice it, that for all these years
You’ve led a life of virtue;
Few baronets keep good so long—
The wonder is you e’er “ went wrong.”

crusade is the moat infenal humbug going, and is
being worked by the banks. If the Parliament
gives way to the squatters the banks will realise
enormous profits.
London Moonshine, a yelping little Tory
paper, whines out its lament toat the property
qualification for the House of Commons has been
abolished. This is really a very small grievance.
Moonshine should remember the pillory, the
death-penalty for sheep stealing, rotten boroughs.
Catholic persecution, religious intolerance, and
royal tyranny and then evolve one comprehensive,
soul-rending howl over the whole lot. And If the
little rag «xpires in a paroxysm of grief the world
will not stop rolling in order to attend the funeral.
The members of Parliament present at the
Orange Celebration in Sydney on the 13th of July,
were:—Metsrs. Jacob Garrard and J. S. Hawthorne
(Balmain), Francis Abigail (West Sydney), W. J.
Poster (Newtown), John Davies, C.M.G. (South
Sydney), John Cash Nelld (Paddington), J. Creer
(Newcastle), A. Bowman (the Hawkesbury), T. R
Smith, and Sir Henry P»rkes. We mention the
names of these legislators now so that such of their
constituents, who do not desire to promote and
perpetuate sectarian strife and ill-feeling in this
young country, may bear them in mind at the
next general election.

AT THE MAYOR’S FANCY DRESS BALL.
MR. CUSSTIS (in costume of the past): "HELLO! BROWN, YOU HERE?"
BROWN (in ordinary evening dress): “YES, I’M HERE IN THE COSTUME OF A GENTLEMAN
OF THE LATTER HALF OF THE PRESENT CENTURY.”
MR. CUSSTIS: "AND YET I KNEW YOU AT ONCE!”
A West Australian journal suggests as a
means of meeting the Chinese difficulty to abolish
the poll-tax now levied and charge a heavy exit-
tax instead on all who leave the colony, The
writer reckons that the children of the eua would
leave all the same, as they all have a desire to die
at home If possible, and he thinks it would be
easier to collect £ 100 a head from the compara-
tively rich Mongol who is going away than £lO
from tha poor one just arriving. This Is The
Bulletin's own copyright idea, first mooted in
these columns many months ago.
It is not mentioned in any of the Sydney
papers that Mr. Abigail had aa exceedingly bad
quarter of an hour at a recent meeting of opera-
tives within the bounds of his own constituency.
His reception was exceedingly unpleasant, and
Instead of justifying his present position with the
Opposition, he dilated upon some services alleged
to have been rendered in the past. Electors have
short memories, but not too short to prevent
Fonettc Frawncis and his colleague, Dan. O Con-
nor, from meeting with defeat if a prema-
ture dissolution is granted to this Parliament.
It is commonly asserted that Dan. O’Con-
nor’s alleged curtain performance at the Red-
mond meeting has lately been imitated by a Severer
man than Dan.—Sir Henry Parkes, to wit. The
report goes that Sir Henry went out to J B
Neild’s Paddington meeting, but the appearance
and tone of the audience were so unpromising that
he departed in much haste If this be true, and it
is strongly affirmed, it affords a proof of the
results of evil companionship. By consorting with
Dan,, Sir Henry has adopted some of Din’s
devices. But after ail, we don’t know whether
Dan. is not sure to suffer most from the political
companionship.
Reynolds’ Newspaper of Juae 13
** In London during the week only two ciergsmen
of the State Church appeared in the law courts
This is an unusually small number, and one is led’
to think that the example of the Salvation Army
is improving the morals of the metropolitan clergy
One of these State-paid saviours of souls, the Rev*
C. A. Burleigh Hare, of Seaton Carew, Durham’
was committed for trial on a charge of inciting a
boy to commit an unnatural offence. The other
a Rev. Mr, Fish, rector of St. Margaret Pattens and
St. Gabriel, in the city—with an Income of £833 a
year and an empty church—was committed to
prison for a debt of £7 10i. due to a trader in Ful-
ham. These are the kind of men to whom we
entrust the charge of our souls and of our sons
and daughters. Would such things be possible in
a voluntary establishment ? The sooner we abolish
this abominably corrupt Church the better it will
be for the morality of the nation.”
This is how the Hon. 8. S. Cox, or, as he is
termed. Sunset Cox, of N.S.W., who has been on
® tjfsvels places the British occupation in Egypt:
~ The 7.000,000 of people in unfortunate Egypt
be very rich, very comfortable, very happy,
if they could only g<-t rid of the fearful disease of
government. They are robbed by taxes and by
aristocracy until the millions are abject, poverty-
stricken slaves without a hope on earth beyond
the next meal.” “ The English are everywhere in
Egypt, he says—“ in the slums of Cairo and the
ball-rooms of Alexandria the red-coat flourishes.
And he is as insolent and truculent there as every-
where else, regarding all other Europeans as
foreigners ’ and abettors of the ‘ rebels.’ ”
At a recent meeting of tailors in London to
protest against the “sweating” system, some ex-
ti-aordlnary, yet apparently true, statements were
made. Sixteen hours a day is said to be the usual
time of labour, and yet, even so, the operatives
can earn only just enough to supply the barest
necessaries of existence, and must live eight or
ten in a room. The Factory Acts are said to be
systematically avoided, the masters marching
their hands out at one door as the inspectors come
in at the other. Some of the work is done in dens
which are noisome and unhealthy to a degree, and
it Is alleged that infectious diseases are continu-
ally spread by this means. One tailor said that he
had made a coat for the mayor of an English city
in a filthy den above still filthier stables. Resolu-
tions wi re passed demanding a reduction of the
hours of labour to twelve. .
How to make prisoner* pay. In Canton
Neuchatel, a good handicraft is taught to every
prisoner, and all who are well-behaved are, after a
period, placed outside the prison with a master of
the trade which they have severally learned,
under the oversight of the police and of a member
of a voluntary committee. This committee is
composed of 1400 active members, out of a total
population of 103,000. The prisoner, when “ pro-
visionally liberated,” has to present himself every
week to his patron, who receives the reports of
his master and of the police. The patron sends an
abstract of these reports to the governor of the
and in this way. if his conduct remains
good, the man's liberty is gradually restored and
he regains his pc sltion in society—with the addi-
tlonal advantages of experience of discipline and
knowledge of a trade. Well may M. de Laveleye,
in describing this system, say that a Swiss canton
is in some things a century In advance of the rest
of the world.— Pall Mall.
It is not likely that the decision of the
N.B.W. Assembly on Mr. Fester’s motion, ques-
tioning the propriety of the expulsion of Mr.
Wisdom, will be final. That Mr. Barton had great
provocation for his action must be admitted, and
it is also certain that Mr. Wisdom deserved
nothing less; but at the same time there are grave
doubts as to the power of a Speaker to expel a
member on his sole authority under any set of
circumstances whatever. To assert that he can
do so, is to hand over to any future Speaker the
power to exclude members at his own arbitrary
will. It is not disputed that another, and a per-
fectly lawful course, was open to the Speaker;
and, by acting outside of all precedent, he seems
to have committed the same error as in the in-
troduction of the Iron Hand rules. Those rules
might have been legally adopted by means of a
certain defined procadure, but by introducing
them otherwise, Mr. Barton exposed himself to
the adverse decision of the courts. It will pro-
bably be the same in this case.
Editor Bulletin,— ’Tis hardly worth
while your quoting statistics to prove the general
Ignorance ot the Irish peasantry in face of this
awful fact. At the elose of February, ’BB, in many
parts of Western Ireland the farmers had already
tilled, manured, and eut the land into ridges to re-
ceive the seed which up to that time they hadn’t
got to put into the soil. And are those miserabies
expected to send their children hungry and naked
to school ? Under happier circumstances there is
no people prepared to make so many sacrifices in
the cause of education as the Irish. There is no
father who takes more pride in the “ schooling ”
of his children than the Irishman, however Igno-
rant, and there is no boy who on the average does
more credit to his tutor than the son of the
Irish toller. Look at the prize-lists of the
colonial universities—look at the lists of colonial-
made barristers and doctors, and enquire as to the
nationality and means of the parents of the men
whose names are enrolled thereon. If you would
have proof of ibis. It would, perhaps, le too
bold to assert that the Irish student outpaces all
competitors, the Hebrew alone excepted, in the
race for scholastic honors; but it may safely be
said that he far more than holds his own against
all comers in the colonies, and that the same
eagerness and capability for mental improvement
u y hir ? lp thQ land of Australia
woula be shown by him under altered conditions,
even in his native bogs.—Yours, truly, Paddy.

newal of the lease of the parson’s glebe as a race-

At the aforesaid Oadby, by the way, last Derby
Day, nine boys were each ordered to pay 3s. (sd.
costs, or to suffer three days’ hard labour, for
playing a harmless game of chance called boat-
racing, the game consisted in sailing bits of stick
down the brook, the ow n er of the winnlag “ boat ”
drawing the stakes. Whether the stakes were
farthings or marbles does not apoear. The magis-
trates who are responsible for these proceedings
are three military Tories. Colonel Mansergh,
Colonel Seddon, and Major Knight. This is strain-
ing at a gnat and swallowing a camel with a ven-
geance. Aristocratic patrons of the turf not only
set up a racecourse but use their money to con-
trol church property In the Interests of sport, and
then the magistrates lino boys for doing with bits
of stick what “their betters ” do with racehorses,

tions snobs of the colonies go to England to prop
The Victorian Protectionists hare come to
loggerheads among themselves over the ques-
tion of raising the duty on imported woollens
mi? m , per cent - to elghteenpence per pound,
ihe increased Impost is proposed mainly
m „, 0 threats of the Geelong woollen
mills, which, like everything else In that
gospel-governed town, are la a somewhat dead
and alive condition. Fifteen per cent, duty is
found Insufficient to protect the drowsy Gee-
longeese against English manufacturers with
cheaper labour, improved machinery, and, above
* ™? re ,‘ko.” Mill-owners produce the wrong
stuff In the wrong war, and unless a sympathetic
Government does something P.D.Q. (whish, being
Interpreted means) “pretty darn quick’’) this
weak-kneed industry Is doomed. Undoubtedly, it
would only be In accordance with the true prin-
ciples of Protection that a duty should be Imposed
on woollen goods sufficiently heavy to Secure a
monopoly for the local manufacturers. &gy it
should be compulsory on evety Victorian to clothe
his nakedness In Victorian-made garments. But
on the other hand, the clothiers—the makers-up—
are protesting against any change, which would
interfere witn their Protection. They export
some £257,000 of slops annually, moat of which
trade must be lost If the Importation of Eng-
lish shoddy Is saddled with an extra burden.
Some of the clothiers go so far *s to say
that under such circumstances, all the ready-
made togs worn in Victoria would com© direct
from London, unless some®ore duty were clapped
upon them, as well as goeds in the piece. The
interests of the enterprising clothiers and the
sleepy-headed mill-owners are directly antago-
nistic. Both parties want prota ctlon against Eng-
land, but whereas the Victorian: manufacture! s
demand a prohibitive duty on cloth, their an-
tagonists only demand a duty on clothes.
Although the makieg-up trade of Victoria is a
far bigger thing than its tweed manufacture, yet,
from a true Protectionist standpoint, the
clothiers have all the worst of the argument.
With an abundance of the raw material ready to
band, a Protectionist Government is untrue to its
principles If it doesn’t fester woollen manufac-
tures at any cost. The right men would run mills
quick enough if the whole trade of the colony
were assured to them. To sacrifice the manufac-
ture of woollen goods for the sake of the clothiers,
is to protect the branches while cutting ihe root.
It Is like discouraging local wheat-raising in the
interests of local bakers. It now appears that the
Government has arranged a feeble compromise
by putting 5 per cent, extra duty only on piece
woollens and slops alike.
Helen Hart, the gentle feminine who re-
eently attempted to cowhide a Castiemaine editor,
and was ignominiously rolled on the office lioor
hetured on “ Women’s Eights,” at Newmarket
l Vic.), the other evening, and was there presented
with a costly bouquet of ripe cauliflowers and
decayed cabbages; alto, a tasty wreath of turnips,
by two admiring gentlemen of the district. In-
stead of getting out her little whip, and flagellafe-
iag the admiring gentlemen, artful Helen stood
them before the Kensington Bench, and they sor-
ro wfullylparted £23 before leaving for the country.
Miss Hart may go spouting through the length
and breadth of Victoria for Victoria’s good, but;
she 11 have to find her own vegetables in future.
In the country districts of N.S.W. the
people seem to be getting a little tired of the
" Escaped Nun,” and almost wish she had fallen
over something and been recaptured when she
made her famous retreat from the convent. At
Young, especially, her meetings were a compara-
tive failure, but the lady herself was as gritty as a
wet dog that has fallen down a gravel-pit, and in-
stead of losing heart she bounced the whole com-
munity for not paying to listen to her Yankee
yarns. Though an apostle of liberty, she gives no
one liberty to stay away from her meetings, and,
accordingly, she anathematised the absent parsons
and sat upon the local storekeepers, who, she said,
dared not roll up for fear of being boycotted by
their Catholic customers. Apparently to reason
with this O’Gorman in petticoats is about as pro-
fitable as to argue with a kangaroo on the full hop,
but till we met her we never fully realised what a
noble work the Catholic Church was doing in
keeping nuns locked up, and we would like to
know why they did not chain this particular one
to the convent-pump rather than let her loose upon
an umrotected community.
THE LAST REQUEST.
There have been many curious coincidences in
the world of sport, and many instances of super-
stition are recorded, but we question whether the
annals of coursing offer a more singular illustration
of mingled chance end superstition than the
victory of The Last Request in the Waterloo Cup
for £SCO, run at the Oval, Melbourne, last Friday.
The dog was originally owned by the late Thomas
Dodds, who occupied the position of private trainer
to Sir William Clarke. This animal was always a
great favorite w ith Dodds, who by will beg ueathed
him to Mr. Haslett, of Coburg. His dying in-
junction was that the dog should be well taken
care of, and not allowed to engage in any coursing
competition until the Cup was run for. He ex-
pressed tis firm belief that his favorite greyhound
would carry off what in coursing circles is known
as the “blue ribbon” of the leash in Australia.
And t he ruling passion being strong even in death,
he was extremely anxioiis on the subject. His
last wish was faithfully regarded, and with re-
spectful appropriateness the dead trainer’s pet was
named “The Last Request.” Poor Dodd s good
opinion of his favorite was fully borne out by the
dog winning all its courses in brilliant style, and
appropriating the coveted prize, thus adding a
romantic Incident to the ehronieles of the sport of
eoursing. Last requests are generally faithfully
honored. A notable one which a short time since
came under our observation was that of a gentle-
man well and prominently known, who dying of
Bright’s diseass, made the re quest that a neighbor—
a friend since boyhood—and suffering from the
same comp'aint as himself, would try Warner’s
safe cure before it was too late. The request was
complied with, and the friend recovered. Most
gratefully does the friend cherish the memory of
the departed, who, surrounded by physicians,
would not allow their patient to try that which
baa snatched thSßsands from the brink of the
grave. It is better to request intelligent treatment
before too late, and thus postpone, as long as
possible, the day of Last Requests.

“ Voices of the Night,” at Sydney Royal
°,r a iir ar<J ’ is one °* the wildest pieces of scene-
shifting ever witnessed in Australia, and on that
account it is likely to have a long and successful
run. Regarded simply as a drama, however, the
piece is not there. In constructing the play the
author. Mr. “Thomas Somers” (wbo is alleged to
be identical with a well-known Sydney lecturer)
seems to have secured a pork-fed vision of the
night and chopped it up with the axe of compre-
hensive genius Into six deliriums and an orange
snake. All pretence of a coherent story has been
left out, but where the narrative should be we
have a raw lobster climbing a tree, and an intoxi-
cated yellow agony drinking the Queen’s health
allee samee white man.” There are no less than
twelve scenes, every one of which is in Itself a
magnificent piece of art, and a hindquarter of
drama is impaled on the spike end of each scene.
But it is possible that the author of “Voices
of the Night” thought it advisable, considering
the title of the play, to leave hig audience some-
what in the dark, and, though the action is difficult
to follow, it is satisfactory to know that all ends
well. It is necessary, of course, that vice should
be defeated at the last, and in this case it is
squashed as effectually as the crab that was eat
upon by Jumbo when that portentous animal was
in bis prime.
♦ * *
The first scene is laid at Redfern railway
station, where two wicked men are laying schemes
and two larrikins are chivying a Chinaman. In-
cluding the Mongol, that makes five characters
altogether. A virtuous Individual appears, and is
greeted by two charming young ladies; a dirty
ag admonishes a sinner in a stove-pipe hat, and
tells him to come to his wife who is starving; a
sea-captain lays hia vengeful hand on the same
Individual’s windpipe, and wants his daughter;
and a guileless new chum has his luggage stolen
by a cabman and his letters of credit embezzled
by Ananias. Later on we learn that the good man
is a Communist escaped from New Caledonia,
where he had been sent on a false charge, and
owing to the strawberry mark on his arm we are
able to recognise the stove-pipe hat as his long-
lost brother. Messrs. Joe and Jack Willis, aided
by Ah Chow, Chow Fat, and Wong Hi, then finish
cleaning out the new chum, and that gentleman Is
reduced to sleeping in the Domain. Here the
stove-pipe man gets a friend to throw his wife
over the rocks, but the lady, by good luck, falls
into the arms of her father, who is mourning his
lost daughter just below, and she knocks the
breath out of her bereaved parent. The new
chum goes to milk cows with an eye-glass on the
Hawkesbury—that sentence is a little mixed, but
not more ?o than the drama—and in a limp,
doubled-up sort of way, he succeeds in clearing
the Communist of a false accusation of murder,
trumped up by hia brother, but the unhappy man
is dragged off to New Caledonia as an escaped con-
vict, leaving his sweetheart weeping against a
veiandat-post, and for the time vice is uppermost.
• * *
Tableau 111. opens with a snake and a
raw lobster climbing a tree. The sinner with the
tall hat, aided by the other sinner with the wide-
awake, has persuaded the sorrowing sweetheart
to take a voyagejnja schooner, under the pretence
of rescuing her lover from Noumea, and has car-
ried her off to New Guinea. The girl, however,
fully believes she is in New Caledonia, and sud-
denly sights her lover on a raft out at sea. She
flies to his rescue, and the conspirators stand on a
tuft of grass and curse their evil luck, while the
snake, listening behind a tree, resolves to bite
them at the first opportunity and makes a knot in
his tail to keep him in mind of this engagement.
Finally, however, the reptile, after dancing a
venomous jig on the stage, is shot, the thin and
haggard, but still honourable, Communist is res-
cued, and the party return to Sydney. At the
station on the Hawkesbury the depraved brother
attempts once more to abduct the young lady, but
the neif-ohum is lounging about with a revolver
in front of him and a door-post behind, and the
baffled sinner is left standing with his legs wide
apart, like an enraged pair of compasses. Later on
he chloroforms his brother and lays him on the
Coogee tram-line, but a relief expedition seize
him by the legs and haul him off just as the motor
comes along. The sixth tableau is devoted to un-
corking a bottle of fine old crusted vengeance.
The blighting genius in the tall hat is found It an-
log against the wall of a dirty room, but he rushes
out to perpetrate some transgression that he has
forgotten. In his absence the new-chum comes in
and also leans against the wall, but presently,
owing to architectural defects, he falls through
Consequently he is not there while the other man
is drugging a young lady, and he also misses the
sight of two brothers fighting with knives and
painting the whole leasehold property crimson.
But presently his eye glass irises in the east like
the morning sun on a fair landscape, and he
smooths matters wonderfully by proving to be a
detective and arresting all the unrighteous crowd.
It is consoling to learn, however, that the straw-
berry mark has deceived us, and that the supposed
brother is only a distant relation by bigamyj or
something of the sort. His ultimate fate is uncer-
tain, but it seems safe to pres'ume that he was
shortly afterwards out off like a flower in hia
bloom, and is now keeping company with Cap-
tain Moonlight, C.M.G.
«» v *
The best parts in the drama fall te the lot
of Mr. Dampier, who stands behind an eyeglass,
waiting for his remittance; Messrs. Baker and
Stoneham, the two leading villains; Mr. Alfred
Boothman, the Communist; Mr. Leston, as a
Chinese cook, who makes rabbit-pie out of cats;
and Mr. Tasman. Among these six it is almost
unfair to draw distinctions, for all are exceed-
ingly good, but the new chum and the Chinaman
are the principal favourites. The ladies, too, fill
their parts well, Mies Dampier and Miss Julia
Merton being worthy of special praise; and if this
brilliant zoological show fails to become anything
more than a landscape nightmare, the fault can-
not be charged to the performers. Even the snake
displays a surprising amount of dramatic ability;
and the tree-climbing lobster,though seemingly
only an amateur at his work, is about as good as
Could be expected. All this reptile wants is a little
more activity, and if his joints are oiled, ho will
probably, ere long, attain perfection. We trust
the unboiled animal will take this hint in good
part, for we can assure him that we have always
made it a rule to lend every possible encourage-
ment to really talented lobsters, and we have
never yet refused to extend the claw of sympathy
to a persevering member of the family.

The announcement of another new pro-
gramme at Sydney Princess drew a damp and
muddy audience together on that water-tight
home of minstrelsy, on Monday night. The crowd
might certainly have been larger, but the weather
offered every inducement to the public to stay
away, and the state of the streets was a direct in-
centive to profanity, in York-street alone we
counted no less than 13 different kinds of unspeak-
able slush, one of which was an entirely new and
very interesting species. It was brown in colour,
indescribably slippery, and of the consistency of a
toad that had been trying to hold up a tram-car
and had failed in the attempt. A carefully-bottled
specimen, labelled with a few scientific observa-
tions from Baron Macleay and with a patriotic
outburst from Mayor Young gummed on to the
cork, would make a most attractive exhibit for
the Indian and Colonial show, and we trust the
matter will be attended to at once.
* » 9
The first part of Mr. Hugo’s new pro-
gramme is hardly a success. The jokes of the
corner-men can scarcely become worse than they
noware; and one was especially noteworthy, for
it took 10 minutes in delivery, and proved to be
fully 10,000 years old when finished. The songs
were only tolerable, excepting the last which was
used as a peg on which to hang the chorus, “ Save
my mother's picture from the sale,” and regard-
ing it all that need be said is—if the picture was
half as execrable as the song no one would have
bought it. The triple pedestal act in the second
part was very good, showing that a man can stand
on something even narrower than his dignity, but
the speech which came shortly afterwards
was a blight that was equal to spoiling the
best potato-crop ever grown in Ireland,
It was advertised as a “ great stump ora-
tion,” but unfortunately the greatness was
left out and the stump proved to be merely the
fag end of Sairey Gamp’s umbrella. Miss Mel-
ville's song, “ I’m but a simple peasant maid,” was
the gem of the performance, and helped to lighten
the gloom; and the ever-popular “ Gaffers of the
Gang ” brought down the wet and dispirited house
in a burst of applause, while Fred Garnett broke
his previous records by tying his head in a knot
round his neck and then swallowing his legs and
waist, or something equally surprising. But as
the audience filed out, the shadow of the stump
oration was still hanging over them, and the
majority looked as if they were going to pass the
remainder of the night by the bedside of a sick
friend. It can only be hoped they did not carry
out this intention, or the invalid would have
assuredly passed away before morning,

Besides the accustomed stars in the “Fun
on the Bristol” constellation at Gaiety Theatre,
Sydney, there is one which shoots—Ala the
athlete to wit. JUola was the last special star, but
she was not a shooting one—she was shot, out of a
cannon too. Ala goes through a lot of interesting
work on the bar, and then goes on a rocket trip to
a trapeze on the roof, from which he descends
hurriedly, feet foremost, and alights in a net
stretched to await his coming. It is a pretty per-
formance : we would walk 50 miles to see John
Lucas, or a etonewaller, do it. Dudley Reid is
worth watching at the “ lightning cartoon” busi-
ness, Subjects in natural history, such as the
“equus caborum,” or common cab-horse, now
especially engage bis attention. He takes 30
seconds to draw a cab-horse which looks unable to
draw him any in double the time. Arthur Gordon
does some clever mimicry, imitating to the life
the Inimitable William Horace. He will probably
try to imitate Keenan when he gets new gables
built on to his mouth.
♦* * *
At Sydney Opera House “ The Private Sec-
retary’ 7 is closing his brilliant career, preparatory
to starting for that bourne from which no goloshed
curate ever returns. A rumour is afloat that at
the end of his present engagement the pulpy
clergyman will be promoted to a vacant bishopric,
and as many believe that a “ gaffer” priest should
be seen and not heard, he will no doubt give satis-
faction and be an ornament to the church. Mr.
Spalding’s talents are not of a kind to qualify him
for shining in Parliament, and his bottle of milk
would look sadly out of place in an Orange demon-
stration, but he is admirably fitted to be cut up
into bishops, especially as there seems just now to
be rather a scarcity of the genuine article. On
Friday—the last night of the season—the come-
dietta, “ Coming of Age.” will be produced as an
afterpiece, with Mr. Thornton in the leading
character.
** • *
The part of Tom Cooper, who is the good
young man in the drama now in its last nights at
the Theatre Royal, is taken by Mr. Herbert Flam-
ming. He fills It fairly well. Where rapid action
is wanted he is all there, but in pourtraylng linger-
ing grief he has a left-handed look. He gets
smitten with sufficient prominence, and works
himself up to appear haggardly woebegone, but he
doesn’t manage to squeeze into the place where an
audience keeps its sympathies. Mr. B. C. Calvert
was the shrewd detective officer. This gentleman
is a massive piece of stage property. He got
nothing very remarkable to do, but whenever he
put in an appearance be looked the most im-
portant person in the crowd.

Refreshed by an invigorating journey to
Liverpool, and a sight of the colonial patriarchs,
Horace Bent and Sam Keenan were even more
than usually enthusiastic in their business at the
Sydney Academy on Saturday last. The business
swirls along with its wonted momentum, and is to
receive an extra push from the Raynor Brothers;
who, having separated from the Rickards crowd,
have come over to throw a crown of hilarity and
high art upon the brow of the Sydney public.
With such an accession the Federals should be
more popular than the murder of a bailiff, or the
funeral of a stonewaller. Saturday next will be
the date of the Raynors’ first appearance under
the segis of the enterprising Hiscocks.

An entertainment of an entirely novel
character was held recently at Young, when Mr.
G. A. Sher win, brother of the “ Tasmanian night-
ingale,” who is now using her talents with such
effect and profit in London, and Mr. James
M’Kay, who has already published some clever
poems, produced some songs of which the former
contributed the music, the latter the words. The
local papers criticise favourably, and the reputa-
tion of the two gentlemen warrants the anticipa-
tion of good work.

The latest thing in eomie opera is “ Nell
Gwynne,” at Melbourne Opera House. Music by
Planquette (father of “ Les Cloches de Corneville ”)
and libretto by H. B. Farnie. The name of this
opera is one of the chief things in its favour. It
promises “social scandals” and real right royal
orgies. Fortunately, this promise is not ful-
filled. Charles 11. (whose appearance sadly belies
his masher-like reputation) only pops on in time
to see the curtain fall, and as for Orange Nell, she
is distinctly nice, but not a bit naughty. The plot
of the opera is composed of drearily ingenious
complications. Buckingham and Rochester, tem-
porarily exiled from Court, endeavour to kill
time by running a rural pub. and “mashing” rural
maidens. This pub. supplies a long-felt want
among the local rustics. Every man endowed
with a young daughter, sister, pretty aunt or
eligible step-mother gets his board and lodging
free of charge. That the whole of the sex is put
upon the free-list goes without saying. Juit as all
far-seeing fathers (in the audience) are beginning
to tremble for the future of the village feminines,
pretty Nell Gwynne appears upon the scene and
circumvents the dark designs of the two wicked
peers. She and a young laoy friend engage them-
selves as domestics at the inn, lure on the bad
Buckingham and ruthless Rochester to make love,
adopt sundry disguises, and finally “split” on
them to the virtuous Charles. A superabundance
of incidents crop up, and everything ends happily.
There is not much originality about the way in
which things are worked out, nor are some of the
characters unfamiliar. The miser Gaspard and
the pudding-headed Bailee of "Les Cloches”
are served up once more as a pawnbroker
and a beadle respectively. The climax of the
second act, where the pawnbroker thinks he seas
ghosts, is suggestive of the same opera. With an
honourable exception in favour of one solitary
air, the music is not catchy. However, it must be
admitted that scenery, appointments, and inciden-
tal maidens are all pleasing. Among the prin-
cipals, Mins Bmelie Melville shines whenever she
gets an opportunity, and Miss Fanny Llddiard—
with the song aforementioned—makes a charming
niece to the village pawnbroker. “ Uncle’s ” sbr-
vant, played by Miss Aggie Kelton, gives this
young lady a splendid opportunity to air her low-
comedy powers. She wolfs her master’s supper
with an abandon which smacks of genius. We’d
let her eat us if we thought the meal would afford
her equal satisfaction. As Buckingham and
Rochester, Verdi and Armes Beaumont make up
with strict disregard of historical accuracy, the
one looking like bis own imperial self, and the
other resembling a second-hand bandit. Mr.
Beaumont interpolates a favourite ballad, and the
Signor, denied much scope in the vocal depart-
ment, is content to be focussed by the ladies’
lorgnettes. Messrs. John Forde and Edwin Kelly
are ail there as the pawnbroker and beadle, stolen
frol^. '! Cloches.” “ Nell Gwynne,” In fact, is
so efficiently played that It may run another week
or two. By the way, we have forgotten to mention
Miss Ethel Harcourt. Her part is small, but her
appearance is j ust Immense—speaking figuratively.
Mies Harcourt reminds one of a fresh young god-
dess dipped In morning dew. This simile is
patented in all the colonies.
** * *
Very diversified are programmes at Mel-
bourne Bijou. “ Marie Antoinette ” was taken off
on Saturday in favour of “ The Rocket.” This
last firework ought to show up well against the
gloom of the historical drama, in which Madame
Majeronl played her part best to audiences that
were more select than numerous. In these
enlightened days the masses fight somewhat shy
of works devoted solely ta glorification of kings
and queens. To make a real popular success of
“ Marie Antoinette,” the motif must be altered.
For heroine we want one of the poor devils scorn-
fully bidden to "eat grass,” while due justice
should be rendered to the frivolous side of the
martyr-queen’s character. If she had been half
the angel the play would have us believe, she
might have died at an honoured old age with her
beautiful head in the place where Nature Intended
it to remain.

Rockhampton (Q.) is well provided with
accommodation for theatrical visitors; lately,
however, the School of Arts has been acquiring a
decided preference. Messrs. M’Mihon and Leltch
(who write a high testimony in its favour), and > he
Hardlng-Searelle Company among others choosing
to play there rather than in the theatre. It is ex-
ceedingly commodious and well appointed.
** « «
A Rockhampton correspondent writes:—
“ Dear Bulletin,— While Searelle and Harding’s
Opera Company were visiting Rockhampton, a
most painful accident happened. Two men were
drowned in the Fitzroy. One of ihe widows
has five children, and is almost destitute. On
the following Sunday the members of the Opera
Company generously came forward and gave a
sacred concert for the benefit of the fatherless
little ones. The advertisement announced that
the performance wouldn't begin till pretty late,
to allow church-goers an opportunity of helping
along the good cause. The concert proved a
splendid success, over £4O being divided between
the two sorrowing families. On Monday, the local
papers reported a sermon delivered the previous
evening by a local clergyman to his snoring flock.
He told hlsilist eners (any that were awake) not to go
to the concert that night. The play-acting people
did this thing merely to gain a little cheap noto-
riety. Beside?,’ t was a desecration of the Holy Sab-
bath The same evening, ere the opera commenced,
Mr. Searelle presented himself before the large
audience, and immediately began to knock chaff
out of the reverend one, which he did in prime
style. He said‘ Let his or kindred congregations
give an entertainment for the same laudable pur-
pose on any day of the week, and the chances are
that the results will be a paltry £s.’ Nothing near
so large a sum. Proof. To quote the Argus ‘ A
performance, under the auspices of the Indepen-
dent Order of Good Templars and Scotch
Emanuels, was given in Bt. Paul’s schoolroom;
the collection amounted to 235. 3d.’ It is asserted
there were present 1008 persons, so that each pious
soul gave -a farthing. ‘They gave according to
their meanness.' ”

Mr. F. A. Packer, of Hobart, writes us:—
“ I am quite sure you would not knowingly allow
anything maliciously untrue to appear in your
columns; I therefore confidently appeal to your
fairness to allow me to correct part of an exceed-
ingly spiteful paragraph contributed to your issue
of the 17th July, with reference to a concert of
some of my published compositions recently given
in Hobart. The large hall in which the entertain-
ment was given was crowded to excess, and in all
the many hundreds of concerts that I have been
identified with, I do not remember one instance
in which the audience listened more attentively
from beginning to end, or where the most hearty
applause was more spontaneously and generously
bestowed. The concert was not given by me, but
was got un by others for a deserving object, and
I was simply asked to assist after it had been
decided upon. This is a compart!vely small place,
and if any man goes to the front in anything, there
are always some who are mean enough to try to
have a ‘dig’at him; the fact, however, cannot
be gainsaid that without the slightest attempt on
my part to ‘ push’my compositions, by inducing
public singers to introduce them, very many of
my songs, notably ‘Listening,’ ‘For the old love’s
sake,’ ‘ Withered,’ and others, have run through
several editions, and have sold in thousands in
Tasmania and Australia alone. With the unasked
approval and warm commendation of such
musicians as Glorza, Sir Robert Stewart (Prof.
Mus. Dub.), Tosti, John Hill, lima diMurska. Miss
Christian, Armes Beaumont, Herr Schott, Alfred
Piumpton, Madame Tasca, Guenett, Sir William
Robinson, and many others, I can well afford to
pay little attention to envious vilification by cor-
respondents taking refuge under a cowardly
anonym , except to correct absolute misstate-
ments.”

“ Ihe sad hypocrisy of this present world ”
is the subject of a lament from a Melbourne jour-
nalist, and the writer wails through his broken
front tooth about the doings of a number of de-
praved patriarchs from the city of eternal snuffle.
“ I never go to the Melbourne theatre,” he says,
“ without seeing in the front rows, especially with
opera bouffe, a number of well-nigh hairless old
gentlemen from Adelaide drinking in the spicy
bye-words, and floating over the sight of the fair
lasses in dishabille.'’ These individuals when at
home, of course, pose as bald saints, and would no
more dream of going to a theatre than of visiting
a clime where gold has to be carried about In
asbestos jugs, but they will travel a long way to
look at a few girls who have omitted to put on
their wardrobe. Of such is the kingdom of
heaven.

Pity the Sorrows of a Poor Governor!
liOrd Carington, during his career in New
South Wales, has already acted as patron to more
different institutions than almost any man alive,
excepting 1 the Queen, and as she is generally
understood to be a lady, she does not count in
this Instance. His name appears in the prospectus
of almost every charitable association in N.8.W.,
from the “Society for raising testimonials to the
upper classes” down to the “Society for prose-
cuting clerks who falsify the weights of wool-
bales”; he has good-naturedly sympathised during
the last 13 months with 147 broken legs, 713 frac-
tured ribs, S 3 objects on crutches, and 24 indivi-
duals who were suffering from miscellaneous
injuries acquired through falling down 19 deep
holes. He has assisted in one way or another
about 100 religions—equivalent to 150 souls and
5726 col'ectlon-r’ates; he has congratulated the
proud owners of innumerable twins and half-
twins; he has aided more benevolent boards—so-
called on account of their wooden-headedneas—
than could readily be counted, and he has backed
the favourite freely, and never grumbled when
a sporting Moses won the gubernatorial cash. In
fact he has done more kindly actions than could
be noted on the back of one of Mayor Young s
elephantine invitation-cards, and has ! probably
suffered a good deal in consequence. When
we hear, for instance, that “ Lord Tand Lady
Carington were present at a lecture on ‘Pleurisy*
delivered at Sydney School of Arts by MiSg
Costello,” and listened for two mortal hours
jo the teachings of a strong-minded lady on
mustard-plasters, blistering fluids, the. effect
of disease on the margin of the diaphragm,
and other kindred subjects, Iwe begin to com-
prehend that It is not all Joy to be a Governor.
Little more than a week ago Lord Carington had
to dodge rather actively to escape being among
the guests at a wedding held in a drapery ware-
house and he only missed this feast among towels
to Ml . victim to aplet.ro-
pneumonlac lectures.. Almost the only things
left for his Excellency to patronise now are
glanders, distemper, and foot-and-mouth-disease,
and it will be really surprising if he escapes them.
Talleyrand's sayirg about larguage and
thought has been closely noted hy tn editor In
Northern N.S.W. He regards the man who runs
the rival paper as a sincere Christian and an orna-
ment to the community, but he devotes a whole
column to concealing this opinion, and artfully
disguises his sentiments at the very cutset by
alluding to his friend as “ that horribly vile, mean,
and too utterly contemptible, empty-headed
booby, who presumes to attempt to edit a journal.”
Then he recommends this “bleary-eyed, con-
tinually-intoxicated, unwashed semi-inebriate ” to
hold off from the red wine and the amber beer for
a short time, and call in the assistance of some one
.. who knows a comma from a brick and a period
from the river pUnt,” so that their combined in-
tellects may be able to comprehend something
or other not very clearly defined. This is
concealment with a vengeance; but later on
the writer disguises his love still more
effectually, and wraps it in impenetrable mystery
by describing his bosom friend as an “odious
poltroon and insignificant harmless anaconda,”
and alludes to his paper as a “ dodger,” edited by
the “alcohol-diseased brain of a professional bar
loafer.” Next he wants a “ dog-cart” sent round
to pick up and exterminate “this filthy and dis-
eased cur,” or at the very least he suggests that
the owners of the rival editor should be pulled up
for not paying dog-tax upon him. By this time
things are growing so sultry that it is almost
soothing to come across a sentence where this
man of language merely denounces an obnoxious
article as a “heathenish and dastardly attempt”
published in a “banana-kaf printed near the
wharf,” and admonishes “ that ihirty-bob-a-week
scribbler engaged on the auctioneer s poster to
mind his literary eye in future. He regrets, how-
ever, that he is merely replying to “the foam
of a long beer,” and apparently he fancies
that his own mind is burled in a profound Austra-
lian calm, for he says that “were it not for the
reverence he possesses for old age and for the
libel laws of New South Wales, the article that
has made this exiled member of the canine race
tug at his uncombed reddish beard would have
been written in an entirely different strain.’ ’ Then,
with fatherly kindness, he urges this “ hypocritical
hyena” to wash himself and thereby get rid of the
“ obnoxious effluvium” for which the “ intolerant
animal” has hitherto been noted, and, speaking as
a sincere friend, advises “the scribbler of that
wretchedly vile tissue of idiotic ravings to revise
the whole thing, have it corrected, and then give
it to the printer’s devil as a reward foreleaning
the old cur’s hoof-boxes, which, it appears, has
not been done for 30 years.”
How many scores of people, bitten by
Australian snakes, have died from fear and the
remedies employed and not from snake-poison, it
would be hard to say. Usually the fear, apart
altogether from the remedies, would be quite
enough to account for death. When a woman
(say) is bitten by a snake, her friends, even if they
don’t proceed to pump ammonia-and, worse still,
air—into her circulation with a horse syringe, are
sure to give her at least half a bottle of brandy
Within an hour or so; and where is the sober,
clean-living woman whom half a bottle of bush
brandy wouldn’t locate on the edge of the tomb in
any case ? As Krefft has demonstrated, the
majority of Australian snakes are non-poisonous.
And as with much of the snake-scare in Australia,
so with much of the dog-scare in England. The
famous essay of Professor Mosso, of Turin, “On
Pear,” published in 1834, went to prove that the
ravages of cholera was largely due to the terror
engendered in the public mind by newspaper ar-
ticles upon the epidemic. The professor showed
clearly enough the effects of fear on the viscera
and on the nutrition of tissues and proved that
fear went first to prepare the ground for the seeds
of the disease. Hundreds of instances are quoted
in which diseases have been actually developed
through the nervous prostration caused by terror.
Anxiety and dread and apprehension—we all
know the effect of them. Of how many illnesses
that carry off strong men and women is worry the
primary cause, and worry is but the constant
dwelling of the mind upon dreaded things. Pro-
fessor Mosso in his treatise has much to say of
hydrophobia. Here is one of his authenticated
cases. Twelve years ago a woman was bitten by a
rabid dog, and the wound was cauterised and she
got well. Many months afterwards she was re-
cognised by a student who had seen the operation.
“Hullol” he said, “here’s somebody who was
bitten by a mad dog and isn’t dead 1 ” The woman,
terrified by the student’s words, went home, and
at once developed the symptoms of hydrophobia
and died. Another case. A man suffering from
hydrophobia had made up his mind he was dying.
In one of his convulsive seizures the physician, to
reassure him, stooped down and kissed his
foam-flecked lips. “There,” said the brave doctor,
“if I thought you were suffering from rabies do
you think I’d do that?” The patient began to
improve at once, no more paroxysms supervened,
A HASH-HOUSE PEERESS.
THE YOUNG "LADY WHO SLINGS HASH” AT OUR BOARDING-HOUSE (loq.): “D’YE
WANT ME TO GO HOME AND WRITE A FORTNIGHTLY LETTER FOR THE ‘TOWN
AND COUNTRY JERNEL [?]”
and he recovered as if by magic. The late Sir
James Stephens declared again and again that the
fear of diseases engendered them, and many of
the best authorities are convinced that in nine
cases out of ten it is fear that brings on hydro-
phobia, and not the bite of a mad dog. These
facts cannot be insisted upon too often. The
terrific epidemic of hydrophobia all over Europe
and America only set in after Pasteur, his experi-
ments, and his patients had been sensationally
advertised in the newspapers of the world. There
is not the slightest doubt that had there been no
Pasteur, and no dog-muzzling, and no news-
paper scare, hydrophobia would have kept
within its normal proportions. As it is, the
public mind is terrorised, and we see the result.
There is a great essay yet to be written on fear as
a pathological factor, says a well-known writer.
Prom our earliest infancy we are terrified. There
is always a bogey of some sort placed osten-
tatiously in our path. The " terror ” poison in-
stilled into the mind in childhood makes its baleful
influence felt through life. I am not sure that
even the modern “knowledge” of which we
boast so much is an unmlxed blessing. We
are “fearfully and wonderfully made;” so
fearfully, that to be happy and easy in one’s mind,
it is best to remain Ignorant of all the facts.
Lately the English Board schools have taken to
teach physiology. In one school, some time ago,
the head mistress received the following letter
from a mother:—“Dear Mam,—Please don’t tell
my gal any more about her inside. It don’t do
her no good, and it’s rude.” One can know too
much about one’s inside. Four years ago I
was laid up with a cold for a week in a
country surgeon’s house. I amused myself
by reading a volume of the Lancet and a
book on surgery. I have never been well since.
I pass my life in trembling lest some of the dread-
ful things I read about should happen to me. One
doesn’t want to know what awful ills poor flesh is
heir to. It is quite time enough to think about
them when they come. In the good old days,
before we knew so much about hydrophobia,
dozens of people were bitten by dogs and took no
notice, got well, and sometimes got bitten again.
Now, if a playful puppy bites a man’s boot, the
sufferer is carried off by a local surgeon to Paris
and Pasteur, and an account of the affair finds its
way into every newspaper of the kingdom. One
dreads to think what the inevitable result of this
reign of dog terror will be. A grave responsibility
rests with those who have fomented the panic and
caused an epidemic which may not be stamped
out for centuries.
Testimonialism Gone Mad.
The worst piece of inane toadyism yet recorded is
the proposal to present a testimonial to “Wales”
for his services in connection with the Exhibition.
For this last specimen of bowing and scraping
K.C.M.G.-ism it appears the Executive Commis-
sioners of the Indian and Colonial cat-show are
responsible, but the name of the top-ass who
originated the scheme has not yet transpired. A
circular has been issued, however, announcing
that subscriptions are wanted from India and the
colonies, and the Imperial hat will shortly be
passed round in many a starving town for the
purpose of gathering money that ought rather to
be spent in buying bread for the hungry. In
N.S.W. the idea will no doubt be favourably re-
ceived, though even in Sydney, which is at pre-
sent far more prosperous than most cities of the
Empire, there are multitudes who have only the
key of the street, and who celebrated their Jubilee
banquet in the damp grass and under the drip-
ping trees of the Domain. The Sydney Mobn-
ing Hebald, on July 17th, published a letter
on this subject from the pen of Mr. Coniah
Hammon, and the picture he draws shows that
we have in Australia a much more urgent ques-
tion to deal with than Wales’ flunkey testimonial.
Mr. Hammon proposes to get a refuge built where
houseless unfortunates can sleep, and as Wales is
already provided with a gilded bunk at the ccst of
the nation this matter should certainly be attended
to first. “It is really heartbreaking,” he says, “to
walk in the early morning through the parks and
backstreets of Sydney. Men and women, poor
and miserable, having no home, no house, no
friends, can be seen here and there sleeping under
trees and gateways, looking really more dead than
alive, and seemingly glued to the damp and chilly
earth, thtir clothing poor and scanty, and barely
suiflcientito cover their wretched nakedness. If
this is the outward or visible appearance of these
poor people, think what state they must be in in-
wardly: shrivelled up no doubt through cold,
hunger, and disease, brought on by dire want and,
exposure. On cold or wet nights, these people,
with their hearts nearly fn zen out of them, may
be seen crouching against the warm walls
of bakeries and foundries, trying by such
means to keep body and soul together.”
As a slight relief for this suffering and misery, Mr.
Hammon urges that a refuge should be available
from 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., to which all comers will be
admitted without question. This suggestion is
about the near est approach to Christian charity
that we have come across for seven years, but we
are prepared to bet none the less that it will re-
ceive no support whatever from the grovelling
K.C.M.G.’s and lacquered snobs who are now busy
polishing royal boots in London. It is hardly
likely that Wales ever knew what it was to go
without his dinner, as so many of his future sub-
jects do, but it appears perfectly right In the eyes
of these bush-flunkeys that they should rob the
poor for his benefit and for the gratification of
their own obese vanity. Ihe success of the testi-
monial will add another stre»k of fat to the bulg-
ing self-importance of the woolly knights who are
so busy disgracing the colonies they are supposed
to represent, and we can only hope that very little
of the cornstalk legal tender will go to swell the
donation. The result, of course, will be the dis-
tribution of a few more “ honours” to the Execu-
tive Commissioners, and after that they must look
around for some new sphere for their loyal
energies. But it is really hard to say what they
can do next, unless they get up a testimonial to
Prince Albert the Good and send it aloft in a
consecrated balloon for their own special glory in
the great hereafter.
A Holy War.
The extension of Holy-Joeylsm and Mosaic
snuffling in the benighted cocoanut-groves of the
South Seas, is a subject on which missionaries
never tire of dilating, and every now and then a
few brown and deceitful apostles are brought
over to be exhibited at Australian revivai-meet-
iegs as a sample of the good work that is being
done. The vessels which convey the labourers
out to the vineyard often carry in addition a few
cases of Brummagem idols, and pretty often hate
on board a choice assortment of rum, but that fact,
of course, is kept in the background, and the less
said about it the better. But, altogether apart
from the rum and the brass Jehovahs, missionary
business does not always lead to peace, as is shown
by some events now taking place in the island of
Rotumah. Some years ago a Wesleyan pastor
went out to seek for any lost sheep who might be
grazing in this tropical region, and altef a iong
period of labour, he succeeded in getting together
a considerable congregation, A Roman Catholic
priest, however, was engaged in the same work;
the clerics were unable to agree, and the two
spiritual deliriums got mixed. The Wesleyan pot-
boiler felt it necessary to explain that the other
fellow was Antichrist, or sometning of the sort,
while the man with the clean shave regret-
fully pointed out that his rival was a heretic and a
sham, and that he alone was authorised to save
souls on that island. Then the respective flocks
armed themselves with hoes and other implements,
and went out to discuss the matter, and with brief
intervals of respose the conference has been kept
going ever since. For a long time the heathen
natives remained neutral, and contented them-
selves with looking on while the. Christians
butchered each other, but of late they have begun
to howl for the Wesleyan dog, as that animal is ob-
viously getting uppermost, and unless the
Pope sends a cheque along to buy guns
with, the Catholics stand a good show of
being wiped out- But the pastors on both
sides have still the supreme satisfaction of
remembering that they have introduced genuine
piety into the island, and done a great work in ele-
vating the barbarous Papuans. Before they came,
the niggers lived lu comparative peace, it is true,
but then they thought nothing of scooping out
the interior of a dead horse and worshipping the
hide, and if, by chance, they killed somebody, they
did not know so much as a text of scripture to put
above his grave. Now all is changed, and by dint
of inscribing a verse over every individual whom
they bury, the Protestants have, within the space
of six months, used up Genesis, Exodus, Leviti-
cus, and Numbers, and are pounding steadily
along through Deuteronomy, while the Catholics
have shoved along as far as the wanderings of
Israel in the wilderness, and planted their latest
victim with the motto. " Thou shalt not kill.”
In “embezzlements” things have been
rather quiet lately, in the holy city of Adelaide,
the market having evidently suffered from the
recent glut. “Building societies,''’however, still
continue to be enticing stocks, and a very fair
line has been reported from a provincial town.
The amount wh en changed hands was not so
large as has been the rule in transactions during
the past few months, being only £2500. This the
local mayor is alleged to have annexed in an
“easy and accessible way.” A warrant has fol-
lowed the deal,” and the dealer will follow th®
warrant in due course. So far. it has not been as-
certained whether the robbery was done in the
name of the Lord.
“Dbab Bulletin,— The Western squatto-
crats are howling aloud for sympathy, and are
crying ‘ stinking fish’ most pertinaciously. They
forget to lay before the public ‘some things.’
Look here. I make out from their own figures
that it costa a station depasturing from 50,000 to
60,(00 sheep £1000 a year less carriage on their wool
to Sydney now that the railway has been extende
to Bourke, the difference being from £10 to £4
per ton. They savq. this amount, but they care-
fully omit any mention of this saving. Then
again, some squatters made as much as £1600
during last year by letting portions of their runs
for agistment. This is not mentioned. And again,
they meanly attempt to recoup themselves by
cutting down the shearers’ wages. Finally, several
are to blame for overstocking for the purpose of
effecting a sale I know one man who, to sell a
station, put 90,000 sheep on it; he knew the coun-
try would not carry it. Nearly 60,000 died I Com-
ment superfluous I— Belshazzar.”

An Orange Corroboree.
Every succeeding Twelfth of July appears to
show the Australian Orangeman in a more and
more obnoxious character, and people who stand
by and note his increasing eccentricities are be-
ginning to wonder how far the process of de-
generation can go. Even in his beat days the
Orangeman consisted merely of two thin and
bigoted legs surmounted by the decomposed
shadow of a missing intellect, and every year the
shade of his thinking organ grows more intan-
gible. But the steady decrease of the mental
powers which were once supposed to be stored in
his top end causes him no distress, for his work is
of a kind that can be done with his stomach and
back legs without the aid of the nobler organs of
the human frame, and this bigoted wallaby con-
tinues to skip through the verdant groves of
ignorance with the springy stride of Dan.
O’Connor in chase of a Ministerial portfolio.
Tne Twelfth of July celebration at Tam-
worth, N.8.W., showed that the pumpkin-
skulled qualities of Orangelsm are still as good
as new, and some of the speakers mani-
fested a freshness and vigour in their remoteness
from solid fact that would have moved Baron
Munchausen to envy. The Rev. H. E. Tydeman
led off well by drawing attention to the circum-
stance that 44 the English Church claimed to be
older than the Church of Rome,” and, unhappily,
no sensible man was present to remind him that the
monstrous flam embodied in that claim was none
of his business, and had better be left alone. Mr.
Gladstone, he pointed out, 44 was trying to alter
the established religion and to subvert the Protes-
tant succession,” and he had also 44 tried to get the
coronation stone of the Queen removed.” He did
not stop to explain, however, to what distant
region the Premier desired to hump the colossal
Protestant brick in question, nor what the Holy
Roman cause would gain by its being dumped into
a barrow and wheeled away. The Church, as we
all know, is founded on a rock, but no one has yet
ventured to aver that Anglicanism is built upon
a chunk of quartz or a cretaceous fossil.
Should such be the case, however, it will explain
much that has hitherto been Incomprehensible in
connection with the Anglo-Saxon bishop trade,
for a church which is based on a coronation stone
is bound to be both narrow and shaky. Mr. Tyde-
man, fortunately for himself, did not stop to pick
up the fragments of bis mangled argument, and
he got on safer ground when he went on to lay
down the three great objects for which Orange-
men should strive—to keep children from being
sent to 44 Popish schools,” to have the conventi
thrown open for inspection 44 so that they might
be sure there were no women detained there
against their will,” and 44 to make every priest
either marry or leave the country.” The final
proposition might very well have been coupled
with a stipulation that every Protestant parson
was in future to keep moral or emigrate, or that
every Orangeman must wash himself and put on
a clean shirt or scoot, but Mr. Tydeman quite for-
got these points, and sat down amid applause,
44 having had a most patient and impartial
hearing.” He was succeeded on the ros-
trum by a high-coloured blossom named Jacob,
who started with a passing allusion to the moth-
eaten old gag about the Bible being the source of
England’s greatness. Anybody but an Orangeman
would know by this time that England’s greatness
consists of grog, opium and bayonets, but such
carnal lore is hardly likely to be familiar to a man
who describes himself as 44 an English-Irishman,”
and yet adds that his mother was a Scotchwoman.
Jacob’s pride in the mongrelio (new word, strictly
copyright) combination reminds one in a round-
about way of the hopeful assertion made by
the Sydney Imperial Federationlsts on last
Fourth of July, that the population of the
North American Republic—consisting of ten or
eleven stolid millions of pure and cross-bred
Germans, nine or ten millions of noisy Irish, three
or four millions of Scandinavians, several millions
of French, say a couple of million or so of
Spaniards and Italians, and about ten millions of
niggers whom the British Imperialists did their
le\ el best to keep under the stockwhip at the time j
of the war—are thoroughly and furiously British
at heart, and are ail longing for a chance to
federate in the bonds of the Garter and the Bath.
Mr. Jacob then bid for a little cheap notoriety by
challenging Cardinal Moran to take up the cudgels
on behalf of Romanism and meet him on any pub-
lic platform, but it is likely the Cardinal has some-
thing better to do than waste his time debating with
a man named Jacob who only escapes the suspicion
of being an Orange Hebrew by declaring himself a
British mongrel. When the Archbishop of Can-
terbury agrees to discuss religion in public with
Father Huggard, of Bourke, then Cardinal Moran
will probably come forward, and things will be
about square. Mr. Jacob, however, appears to
have at least the merit of sincerity, for he declares
his readiness to leave his wife and children and
take up arms in the cause of the Ulster Orange-
men; so we presume the Jacob family may live
on benevolent-asylum skilly, while the fond
parent waves a Protestant bedpost in the front of
tha battle. By the time the orator had finished
there was not much left of Roman Catholicism,
and all Ireland, with the exception of Ulster,
might regard itself as wiped out of the solar sys-
tem. Even St. Patrick was demolished, as far as
his Hibernian character was concerned, for this
triangular Orangeman declared him to be a Scotch-
man after all, so we must all learn to depict the
holy man in future as a bagpipe missionary who
wore short petticoats and lived on porridge. Then
he turned on the Anglican clergy because they held
aloof from his red and yellow society, and from
that he jumped to the subject of a girl who was
nearly being forced into a convent at Tamworth,
but who was rescued by some Ifith of July heroes,
and thus saved for eternity. But by this time
even his auditors could stand Jacob no longer, and
they pulled him down by the tail, while a lady im-
proved the occasion by singing 44 Home they
brought her Warrior dead,” as a hint of what the
voluble hero might expect in Ulster. Then one or
two more parsons improved the occasion with a
little vocal Protestantism, and the dreary farce of
bigotry and ungrammatical sorrow ended amid a
burst of mutual admiration.
Hugh M'Coll.
The question which stands before all other
public ones in the colony of Victoria at the
present time is that of Irrigation. People had
gone out willingly enough into the backblocks
and tried to make homes that would
At times rain was plentiful, and vegetation
abounded. Flocks and herds increased, and the
selector with his hundred acres, and the grazier
with his scores of miles, rejoiced. At other times
rain did not come, and selector and grazier had to
look on at cultivation disappearing and flocks and
herds dying on the charred plains. The latter
seasons came often. It was known that, one year
with another, sufficient rain fell, but the water
found the rivers and svept onwards to the sea or
sank to subterranean channels and became lost to
use. How to make these rivers throw back their
waters over the land and to bring those subter-
ranean channels to yield up some of their burled
treasure—this, to the man capable of entertaining
a passion for heroic national service, was, once
seen, bound to become the question of questions.
* * »
A quarter of a century ago, Hugh M‘Coll,
whose portrait appears on the front page of this
week’s Bulletin, made the question his. Eight
years afterwards he adopted and developed Dod’s
theory of the practicability of constructing a great
north-western '’anal to connect the Murray River
with the sea a£ Portland. He also collected data
which proved the existence of immense subter-
ranean watercourses in the Riverina country, and
charted one as running to waste in the ocean be-
tween Cape Sir William Trant and Cape Bridge-
water. In 1880, he entered Padiament as member
lor Mandurang, and from that day until he died
the purpose of his life was to impress upon the
country and the Government of Victoria that Ir-
rigation was a practical project, and the putting
of it into operation an inexorable
national duty. It dees not want much
virtue to be the apostle of a popular
cause. It wants but little to labour
for an object which the circles above
and around one confess to be good.
But to work with the multitude apa-
thetic and ignorant, and with those
around and above ignorant, prejudiced,
and offensively hostile, requires much
of the nerve and brain that most men
lack. Hugh M’Coli was the Baptist' of a
new cause, but the wilderness about
him was one of inane, unsympathetic
faces. His cry found it hard to pene-
trate. It tickled ears, and eyes
laughed and mouths mocked. But faith
and hope were strong. Alone, isolated,
the white-headed old man stood there
before Parliament, before the country,
unabashed, undismayed. Derision,
mockery, vapidities lof conceit, yaups
of Ignorance, stertorous murmurs of
apathetic laziness arose, surrounded,
enveloped him. But faith in the cause
or confidence in its triumph never
blenched.

Hugh M‘Coll was a Scotchman.
He was born in Glasgow and reared oh
the Highlands. At an early age he went
to work. He started book selling in
three towns, one after another. He
rested longest in South Shields. When
33 years of age rumour that gold
was found in Victoria reached old-
land dens of drudgery, and with his
MR. DANIEL COOPER.
wife and family he sailed for Melbourne. On land-
ing, his wife died and five children fell to his care.
He made a start as printer. Prom that he passed
to journalism. He soon combined both and be-
came proprietor and editor of a country paper.
Thejoutlook hdre darkened. Marrying again, he
quitted newspaper work, and went on the road as
commercial traveller. He travelled for several
firms in succession, and acquainted himself ulti-
mately with the character of the inland country.
He is next heard of as a potter. In con j unction
with a brother-in-law he established a pottery at
Epsom, Victoria. Though success came on the
extension of the railway to that place, the business
did not pay while M’Coll was in it. He abandoned
Epsom and floated a Brick and Tile Company at
Bendigo. He followed this by becoming legal"
manager of a number of gold mines. Prosperity
at last came. It poured upon him. His mining
interests, rated at market prices, rose rapidly to
£lO,OOO, £15,000, and, it is said, even to £40,000. But at
this; stage his office with what it contained was
burnt, and by the time he could look round, the
bottom had fallen out of almost all his mines. He
thereupon quitted legal management for ever.
* * »
So far away as 1843, when a bookseller in
South Shields, he had devoted himself to a measure
dealing with water management. The Corpora-
tion of Newcastle had had control of the River
Tyne for 700 years, and refused to sanction certain
alterations which those Interested in navigation
considered necessary. It is noteworthy that he
acted as secretary for the committee of innova-
tors for nine years, and had the satisfaction of wit-
nessing the triumphal issue of his labours.
Twenty-two years later found him in Victoria
acting as secretary to the Coliban Water Supply
Committee. His going to and fro in the new land
had shown him the necessities of the settlers. Of
the country around the Whipstick he made
an elaborate study. When no other way was open
he and Mr. Benson collected subscriptions to sink
dams there. The Coliban scheme at last succeeded.
The success only urged him on. What he did for
the country around Bendigo, Castlemalne, and
Maldon, he determined to do for the whole
of Victoria. So he worked till the end. One day
he arose from his sick-bed to attend a meeting at
Sandhurst, where the subject of water conserva-
tion was to be discussed. He was taken ill at a
Melbourne railway station and conveyed back to
his house at St. Kilda, where, a fortnight later,
he died in his 67th year. His death sent a thrill
through the community. It brought all eyes sud-
denly to the point at which tbe forces of his life
had aimed. The public conscience was pricked to
a recognition of his work. Parliament was ap-
pealed to to make the recognition tangible by
voting a sum of money to those for whom the old
man, in his enthusiasm for the general good, had
neglected to provide. Parliament wrangled. It
partly passed a grant, and then returned, and
wiped the item out.

Hugh M l Coll did not figure prominently
as a politician, but his opinions were of a demo-
cratic, if not Radical order. He conceived a
passionate admiration for Graham Berry when
that politician was in the fulness of democratic
promise, and, despite all that afterwards happened,
the admiration never waned. In 1871 he first ap-
pealed to a constituency for a seat in Parliament,
but was so harshly repulsed that he had to forfeit
his deposit. He was again defeated in February,
1880. In July of that year, however, he was re-
turned, and from that onward his seat was sure.
The more his constituents of Mandurang knew of
him the more they liked him. Once he was really
known anywhere, liking for him grew. He was
warm, hearty, generous, simple. The clasp of his
hand was tight, the tone of his voice cheery, the
glance of his eye trustful. He would have made
a deeper mark had he not been so mild, so patient,
and so forgiving. A man, nowadays, with a mis-
sion as large as his, wants in him something of the
knife to slit up charlatans, of the maul to flatten
humbugs, of scorn to throw at insolence, and of
passion with which to scorch the ears off knaves.
As it is, poor Hugh M’Coll has gone. He did not
see his work completed. But all the country is in
a hurry now to do it. Those who refused to hear
him, those who mocked most and laughed
most and stood most in his way are now
the most supple in running round the land to have
the work he laboured for accomplished. This is
well. This is what the noble old man, could he see
them now, would rejoice at. But it has a bad side.
It shows how the dead may be robbed. It may be
that the nation owes no dross to Hugh M’Coll, but
it owes him fame. That water scheme is more his
than any other man’s in Australasia. Robbers,
with their sleeves rolled up, stand between his
silent grave and the country, and set themselves
to snatch the garland Time is bearing to him.
A number of bafrowmaniaos have started
for Kimberley, wheeling their provisions in
front of them. They must be tolerably good
marksmen if they hope to traverse 300 miles of un-
known and almost trackless wilderness, and strike
an absent township at the end of the journey. The
man who can hit the edge of a half-crown with a
bullet at two miles distance may how take a rear
seat.
The number of Tasmanians who didn’t
long since expect railway accidents in the 44 Tight
Little Island” might be counted—first time—on
the digitals of our old friend Three-fingered Jack.
About 10 years have elapsed since they com-
menced telling stories there about those con-
venient curves which allowed the guard to get a
light from the driver almost any time he liked;
and several experts, at various intervals, reported
most unfavourably on the conditional railway
construction in Tasmania. Luck carried the
people safely enough for a long time, but of late it
has been turning on them.
The first genuine boycott on record is re-
ported by an antiquarian to have taken place in
Brazil in 1820, when the inhabitants of Custhanas
announced their Intention to boycott the Deity
unless he sent rain. A decree was issued by the
mayor announcing that if the longed-for showers
did not come within eight days all masses and
prayers were to be abolished; after eight days
more the churches and chapels were to be set on
fire; and finally, if the drought continued for
another period of eight days, all priests, monks,
nuns, and saintly women—there were no saintly
men—were to be despatched summarily to heaven
to see what the whole bother was about. It is
understood that the rain came immediately after-
wards. What a blessing it is to have a level-
headed mayor I

Are all men false ? Can all be bought ?
E’en those who Freedom’s battle fought;
Doth lust for titles all enslave ?
What, all ? Nay I Thunders from the grave,
Here patriots sleep, in honour laid.
The people’s trust, who ne’er betrayed.
For what fought Washington so well ?
What fired the blood of William Tell ?
What reft from Garibaldi fear ?
And Hampden to all freemen dear;
Was’t titles, gold ? Nay I Not thus swayed,
The people’s cause they ne’er betrayed.
The dead were true; the quick are bought;
Their vows, their pledges, are as nought—
No I shouts an Empire ’cross the seas.
Bright, Gladstone, from that stain release;
In pinchbeck honours unarrayed.
Their name and fame they ne’er betrayed.
The undying dead still live in song,
The living dwell true hearts among ;
The Paladin of People’s rights
Is nobler than a host of knights.
Bah, Judas I Bah I man retrograde I
Yourself and cause you have betrayed.
Wear, wear a handle to your name.
Its price, your never-dying shame;
Bind to the wheels of Tory car
Your manhood, let no scruples bar;
Full soon to find that, self-betrayed,
The knighthood doth the man degrade.
Not thine to reap in later days
The harvest of a people s praise;
The titles which your name 44 adorn,”
Have wrought for you disgust and scorn;
For glittering baubles, Renegade I
Your very soul you have betrayed.

The bird Imprisoned in a cage
Will carol blithe and gay;
With fulsome voice he utters forth
A plaintive roundelay.
To be like those upon the wing
Who flutter round his cage and sing.
Although their notes may never be
As musical or sweet,
On yonder blossom-laden tree
They sing the song of liberty.
The dawning morn to greet—
While he still chants a sad refrain
To be upon the wing again.
E’en so with me. Life’s passage may
Seem free from grief and care,
And journeying on from day to day
I may appear to others gay,
And have no ills to bear,
The very hour that I may smile
My heart is fit to break the while.

A cabby writes in a London paper“ The
smartest thing I ever heard done to a cabby was
this. One of my mates drove a gentlemen once a
two-shilling fare. My mate weaved about the
road a bit, and so when he reached tbe end of the
journey, the gent taxes him with being drunk.
My mate, being an honourable man, didn’t deny
it. ‘ Very well,’ says the gent, “if I have you up
before the Beak you’ll get lined 55., and have
your licence endorsed. ‘ Quite right, sir,’ says my
friend. 4 Well, then, says the gent, ‘I am disposed
to be lenient. Give me 3s.’ My mate hands over
the 3s„ thinking ho was going to get two half-
crowns back. But what does this gent do ? ‘Why,
he says, 4 two and three is five. As you paid the
os. fine, I’ll let you off the endorsement. Good night.
And my mate was so taken abac* that he drove
away, having paid the gent 3s. for driving him
three miles and a half I ”
The pastoral appraisement court has been
sitting at Bourke during the whole of last week.
The extra work to the staff has almost demoralised
the service; first day, one clerk nearly dead from
the effects of six hours’ continuous writing; second
day, two fresh ’uns had to he put on turn and turn
about—the work was awful. Several interesting
pastoral items cropped up. The Government
appraiser reported that the sub-soil of one block
was of no great depth, that sheep did not eat
timber, and that nothing grew during a drought.
One of the solicitors in attendance opined that
grass was graded as to size similarly to fencing-
wire, and discoursed learnedly, and at great
length, on the non-nutritive qualities of N 0.9 snc
No, 10 grasses. The amount of valuable informa-
tion imparted to the board is such that fears are
entertained that by the time “ tally ’ is called tney
will have to be taken home on shutters.

Scenes from the Sydney Jubilee Ball.


SOCIALS
The Jubilee Costume Ball given by Mayor
Young’ in Sydney Exhibition Building was un-
doubtedly a success. The host had set himself to
break the Sydney record in the way of s 'Cial gor-
geousness, and he did it. Of Mr. Toung’s gener-
osity there can be no doubt. Everything that
gold could obtain was procured for the delectation
of the guests, and as many as the building would
hold ware there. If any did not enjoy themselves,
it was not for lack of aught which the host or
gathering could supply- And to be happy was to
be loyal, for it was the Jubilee Ball, given because
a stout little German lady has been paid half-a-
million a year, since 1837, by the British nation
Sue has sat on the throne for 49 years ; what else
she has done during that time it would possibly
puzzle Mr. Young or any of his guests to say with
any degree of certainty. Probably these Jubilee
rejoicings are congratulatory rather to the Queen
than to the nation. They should be, for the Queen
seems to have very much the best of the bargain.
Therefore we hasten to felicitate her and add our
tribute to that of Mayor Young. For which dis-
play of loyalty we expect at lease a C.M.G.-shlp.

Thea?9emblage was magnificent in the mass,
however peculiar in appearance some of the units
may have been. It was a very carnival of colour,
and, eheu! sometimes a carnival of taste. Glaring
as individual costumes were, they did not fall to
harmonise with others equally glaring of opposing
colour, for the ordinary ruGs of harmony are
abrogated in the presence of elements wh’chare
all incongruous. Hues glittering, gloomy, and
glaring, all contributed to the picturesque
display, and a gorgeous display was the natural
result. Individual costumes showed not much
intentional originality, but very much that
was unintentional Marie Stuart was represented
by about a score of ladies, and that misguided
queen would have repented of all her sins had she
seen several of her personators on this occasion
One lady thought Louis Quatorze patches neces-
sary to the character, and another was unable to
resist the temptation of making another “ im-
provement ” which is strongly characteristic of
Very recent fashions. Very conspicuous were the
girl graduates, and one of them was about as
alluring as any character in the hali. Bjually
conspicuous, but less enchanting, was the young
lady who went attired in the primitive costume of
a black gin; her costume and colour were equally
correct, and her natural beauty was not sum dent
to interfere very materially with the correctness
of the personation. Bed Gross knights were
numerous, but the rumour that any one of them
assumed the dress for the purpose of advertising
a well-known brand of jam is quite unfounded,
As usual, all the ladles with severely angular and
ugly shoulders took particular care to display
them. This is always the way; it is only natural
that ladies should be most generous in exhibiting
features which they themselves cannot possibly
value at a very high estimation on the score of
beauty. Towards midnight one gentleman whose
calves had run down to his ankles was the source
of much innocent amusement.
» * *
The invitations were issued for 8 o’clock,
but as early as 7 the visitors began to arrive, and
from then until after 9 they came streaming in
in hundreds. The Mayor and Mayoress received
taeir guests just within the ballroom, and bowed
to each lady and gentleman as tney passt d into the
room. The Mayor was dressed in his robes of
office, and the Mayoress was a charming “ Maid of
Kent.” Lord and Lady Carlngton and suite ar-
rived about 9 p,m. and were conducted to tne dais
by the Mayor, and then the grand parade com-
menced, led by the Mayor and Mayoress When
nearly all present hud exhibited themselves, the
dancing began. In the opening quadrille, Lord
Carlngton danced with Miss Young, the Mayoress
—the Mayor with Lady Carington, and Aldermen
Playfair and Hardie. with thsir partners, took the
sides. Lady Carington looked most lovely in a
magnificent dress of white brocaded silk made
with a long train —on one side was a tablier of
silver gauze: the bodice was low, and trimmed
with silver jet. Her ladyship wore, ss usual,
beautiful diamond jewellery. The Mayoress, as
“ Maid of Kent,” wore a gown of white net, which
was covered with green leaves and flowers of the
hop plant; a large hat of white satin, trimmed
with white feathers and green leaves. To attempt
to describe a tenth even, of the costumes, would
be out of the question, but we shall mention just
a few that setm worthy of special notice. Lady
Manning wore evening dress of fawn brocade,
trimmed with white lace; Mrs Hardie, as “Mary
Queen of Scots,” wore the usual black velvet robe,
with white satin front, high pearl collar, and black
velvet and pearl cap; Miss Enid Maoarthur, in a
becoming dress as a “Laly of 1848,” looked ex-
tremely pretty; Miss Florence Watt, as “Powder
and Patches,” was universally admired; Miss Cox,
as “ Dorothy Forster,” and her sister, as “ Citizen’s
Wife, 1730,” were very suacesiful in their choice of
costume; Mrs J M.Purves was an extremely banc -
some “Eleanor of Castille,” her costume being
about the moat elegant and costly in the room. It
was composed of the richest wh te satin, the front
beautifully embroidered with blue and gold. The
long train was a lovely shade of blue satin lined
with amber satin; the graceful flowing sleeves
were also lined with amber satin, and bordered
with a deep gold fringe, the low bodice almost
coveted with sparkling jewels and pearls. Miss
Isabel Wallis was bewitching as a “ Watteau Shep-
herdess”; Miss Edith Creer was a charming “Liny
in George 111. Kelgn”; Miss Grenfell, very pretty
as a “Court Lady in the 17th Century”; Mary
Seton, In pale blue; and a lady from Double Bay,
as “Bed White and Blue,” came in for equal
shares of general admiration. Mrs. Scrivener
(Melbourne! was artistically attired as a Gipsy
Fortune-teller, in a skirt of buttercup-colour satin
flounced with black lace, while the bodice was of
black velvet and Indian muslin covered with
sequins and cards. Miss Florence Wade, in pearl-
grey satin, was a charming representative of Mary
Behiogdon, a lady who made herself famous for
her brusque refusal of the love of Prince George.
Of the gentlemen, Mr. Q rung Tart bore off the
belt. He went as “ Masaniello,” a character that
admirably suited him. Mr. Forbes Angus went as
a Chinaman of high rank. Mr. F. Bachs was a
conspicuous “ Bichard I.” Colonel Wells showed
how he frightened the Soudan folks in Kna-
kee uniform—no wonder the niggers lied.
Mr. Gibson was a styll.h “ Claude Duval.’
A special train had been put on at two p m.
for the convenience of western suburbs
guests, and with their departure the ball closed.
Needs helped things along cleverly in his capacity
of M.C., and his band of 30 performers did quite
all that was expected of them,

On Saturday, the 24th inst., his Excellency
and Lady Carlngton went by special train to
Liverpool to be present at an entertainment given
to the inmates of the Benevolent Asylum by Mr.
Quong Tart and a number of iadiss. Attire Town
Hall his Excellency was regaled with the usual
address, and at Its conclusion drew from his pocket
the same well-worn “reply” that has doneduiy
on so many occasions. You all know it, therefore
the classic words that it contains may remain un-
published here. The Convent school-children
came out with their little bit, and Miss Elsie
Maraden read an address to Lady Carington and
presented her with a bouquet. Then the “ party ”
went over the buildings and saw the poor old sun-
downers and “ hatters ” who have been mercifully
collected and provided with a home. Next came
the entertainment, and the gifted Horace Bent, in
his well-known character of Negro Minstrel, began
to smooth out the wrinkles on the 500 old faces
that looked up at him, Horace must have given
the beet that is in him to his audience, while
Keenan simply opened his mouth and hid behind
ic. After this Mr. Quong Tart sang a dujt w.th Miss
Playfair, and was immediately offered an engage-
ment by the enterprising Hiscooks. Tae Vernon
band played some good music. The whole affair
was an unmistakable success, and a credit to all
those by whose exertions it was arranged.

On Friday evening, the 23rd inst., a grand
Masonic ball was held in the Masonic Hall,
Walker street, SSt Leonards, to celebrate the
jubilee of her Majesty's accession to the throne.
The spacious saloon was decorated with trophies
of Hags, and the general appearance of the well-
lighted building was very effective. His Ex-
cellency the Governor (who was attired la the
dress and regalia ot a Past-Grand Warden of Eng-
land, accompanied by Lady Carlngton, Captain
Saeritfe, a.D.C., and Mr. B W. Wellington,
arrived shortly after 9 o'clock, and were received
by Mr. John Williams, Dr. Sedgwick, Mr. B O.
Smith, Mr. Westoott, Mr. Simpson, Mr. Fisher, and
the members of the committee. Kopsch’s band
played the National Anthem on the arrival of the
viceregal party. In the opening quadrille Lord
Carlngton danced with Mrs. Fisher, and Lady
Carlngton with Dr. Sedgwick. A long programme
was danced through with unilagging energy. Lady
Carlngton was, as usual, dressed in excellent
taste, and there were many other handsome
toilettes la the room. The catering department
was well managed by Compagnonl and Co.

The Petersham Owl Club gave their first
entertainment of the present season on Wednes-
day evening, the 31it, at the local Town Hall. The
first part of the entertainment was in the form of
a concert, and a number of ladies and gentlemen
pleased a large audience by contributing some
delightful ballade, well-chosen operatic music,
good recitations, violin selections. &o. When this
was over the chairs in the body of the hall were
removed, and dancing indulged in for about a
couple of hours. Refreshments were provided In
a room down stairs. The ladies were very happy
in the choice of their costumes on this occasion,
many handsome and becoming ones being dis-
play ed. Mrs. M’Donald wore an extremely elegant
gown of black Spanish lace; Miss Deacon, a be-
coming and simple dress ot *hite muslin and
white laoe, with trimmings of ivy leaves; Mrs.
Weieener, red satin draped with quantities of
black lace; Mias Levy, a very handsome com-
bination of crimson plush and pink satin profusely
ornamented with artificial flowers. A pure white
cashmere, with trimmings ot bright violet, was
much admired; also a cream satin and laoe cos-
tume, with buuohes of pale-pink roses about the
skirt.

The Mercantile Rowing Club have finally
fixed the date for their eleventh annual ball for
Tuesday, the 3rd of August. It is to be hold in the
Exhibition Building, and Mr. w. W. A. Blackstone,
hon. secretary, has Issued a circular stating the
conditions under which tickets are to be obtained
and the arrangements the committee are making
to secure a successful entertainment, a result
which can scarcely fail under the circumstances.
No tickets will be sold at the ballroom door.
Messrs. Needs’ string band provides the music,
and Baumann caters. His Worship the Mayor has
promised to be present, and will open the ball at
nine o’clock sharp.

His Excellency and Lady Carington at-
tended MisB L. Costello’s lecture on “ Pleurisy,” in
the Technical Hall, Pitt-street. At once all Potts
Point became deeply Interested in the subject, and
“ Pleurisy’’ is quite the “ talk” now. In the same
connection we would protest against tne persecu-
tion that BE. and his wife suffer at the hands of a
few old and dull women, who fancy they have a
right to crush Lady Caringtou upon all occasions.
At the Mayoral ball they stood guard the while
time, just to keep the ** vulgar” off. If they knew
what is thought of them they would give up the

The Royal Society of England have found
out that H. B. Russell, of Sydney, is an astrono-
mer, and have made him a Fellow. We don’t
know what that does for a man, but we know that
Mr. Russell has been famous la his profession for
some 30 years; so that it is quite la the order of
things that an English society should to-day begin
to find this out. We congratulate the society.

English papers have, as a rule, avoided
maslug any reference to Australian colonists in
England. Tae only remark we have lately seen
was to the effect that they looked a dreadful lot at

It is said—heaven help us!—that Sir Thomas
and Lady Braisey will soon be on their way to
Australia in the Sunbeam.
They stood conspicuously near the dais at
the Sydney Juollee ball for quite half-an-hour,
looking so happy, so loving, and so handsome
As “ heedless as the de id were they of all around,
above, beneath,” and wuh clasped hands they
waited there, careless of the roll of time., or the
harmonious invitation of moving music. The
cynosure of neighbouring eyes, they were soon
ooservedby Lord Carington, who, looking towards
them, observed—" What a very loving couple I
Husband and wife, of course 1 ” “ Fes, your Excel-
lency, husband and wife,” reolied an attentive
geebung, but he omitted to add that the husband
was someone else’s husband, and the wife, the
wife of another man. So the Idyl of the dance
was not bust up, and bis Excellency is assured that
there is at least one very happy and dutiful
married couple in Sydney.

George's Church, Hobart, last month, some con-
sternation was ere <tad by tha non-appearance of
the bridegroom—Mr, George B. Tidswell, of North
Shore, Sydney—at the appointed time. The bride
—Miss Fannie M Smith, of Hobart—bridesmaids,
guests, and parson were all ready, only waiting
for the necessary bridegroom to complete the
ceremony. The funny man had mistaken the
locality, and proceeded at first to a Congrega-
tional Church, half a mile distant, which occa-
sioned nearly half an hour’s delay. In due time
he appeared on the scene, and promised to ” love
and cherish” in the ordinary way justaa if nothing
unusual had happened.

A plain and fancj’rdrJasa.soolal was given
last week by Mr. and MrsPfe. J. Hughes, when
about 70 of their frieqds r,sre present, and a most
enjoyable evening" spent. Among the fancy
costumes worn by Eidies the most noticeable were
“Forget-Me-Not,” “Swiss Peasant.” “Greek
Lady,” “French Ladv,” “Peg Woffington,”
“German Peasant,” and “Sea Nymph.”

On Friday last the Darlington Social Club
carried out a very pleasant social at the Oddfel-
lows’ Hall, Newtown. About 80 guests attended In
spite of the unpleasant weather. Dancing was
kept going till 4 o’clock, when the party reluct-
antly separated.

H.M.S. Miranda returned to Farm Cove on
Friday last from a cruise In the South Seas. We
understand that sport has been bad there this
season, and not more than two brace of niggers
were bagged, but they were in fine condition.
Something very like the climacteric of
social meanness was attained in Sydney by persons
who were anxious to go to the Mayor’s ball, but
found themselves without the necess iry “ Invite.”
Not only were Invitations accepted in order that
the name on the admitting card might afterwards
be altered so that another person, not Invited,
might go, but acceptances were also sent by some
who had never been invited at all, in the hope of
obtaining the necessary card. The latter dodge
came off in several instances. The aristocrats of
Sydney have some funny little ways.

We read in a Birmingham paper that when
the 150 Oolonials lately visited Sir Thomas Brassey’s
mansion, Normanhurst, some of them, who were
very hungry, "by some means or other got
hold of a ladder, which they reared up against the
side of the house, climbed up, pressed their faces
against the windows of the rooms in which lun-
cheon was being laid, and encouraged the footmen
and others to more active exertions. Sir Thomas
gave his visitors a magnificent luncheon, but it
operated very unfavourably upon the animal
spirits of the less well-mannered amongst them.
One individual, a member of a learned profession,
actually so far forgot himself as to dance a jig on
Sir Thomas Brassey’s billiard-table. Of course the
more respectable portion of the guests were horrified
at the disgrace inflicted upon themselves by the vul-
garity of their fellow colonials, and many of them
have vowed never again to attend any entertain-
ment not up for the benefit of our colonial guests .“
The whole murder comes out in the last few lines.
The glided swells from Australia wno reside per-
manently in England are ashamed of those of
their colonial brethren who are new to the toady-
ing business, and instigate the circulation of lies
about them. “The more respectable portion of
the guests I” Humph! We could name ’em all,
one after the other.

On Saturday, the 2tth, Miss Alice Maclean,
eldest daughter of the late Or. Maclean, of Alberto
Terrace, Darlinghurst Road, was married to Mr.
Llewellyn Meredith. The wedding took place very
quietly at St. John’s, Darlioghurst, at half-past
two in the afternoon. The bride looked very
handsome in the usual bridal attire. She was at-
tended by no bridesmaids, and there were very
few guests. After the ceremony the party drove
to Caprera, Elizabeth Bay, the residence of Mr. J.
M. Purves, where light refreshments were par-
taken of. The newly-united couple left for Mel-
bourne by the express train on Monday afternoon,

Oar dear old friend, Archibald Forbes,
has at last married Miss Lulu Meigs, daughter of
General Meigs. Perhaps it would be more to the
point to say that Mies Meigs has at last gone and
married Mr. Forbes as it seems that it is the lady
who has been hesitating. The wedding took place
in Washington, and was very fashionable.

In Adelaide they are to have a Jubilee Ex-

This is as it should be. If you want fun you must
pay for it. If, after their exhibition, they still

Grafton was en fete last week, the occasion
beiag the annual races. The weather looked very
threatening, but luckily held off till after the 13;h,
Uth and 15th, th-v three days of the year when
Grafton condescend to be amused. Everyman,
woman, and ch . Mlp Clarence and Rionmond
districts seemM and all enjoyed them-
selves. The arraoirements, taken all through,
werelexcellent, though It Is rather a pity that the
accommodation for the ladies, who mustered In
great force, is so limited. A part of the stand has
been partitioned off for their exclusive use, and
as there is no lawn, the only available piece of
ground in front being full of tobacco smoke and
bookmakers, the feminines looked like so many
birds in a cage. Of course there were some dances,
Mesdames Ryan, Small, and Norrie opening with a
ball on Tuesday night, the Gymnasium coming
next with one on Wednesdav, and the bachelors
winding up a very pleasant week with an im-
promptu hop on Friday.

The Orchestral Union, Hobart, is an in-
tensely aristocratic musical society. As the
entree to Government House, however, does not
ensure vocal ability, the select union has to get
help sometimes from individuals who have never
entered those sacred precincts—and probably
never wish to. A young lady, considered quite
outside the aristocratic circle, has given valuable
assistance on many occasions In rendering music
beyond the capabilities of the union vocalists, and
In a manner that charmed the audience, but a re-
cently-imported clergyman’s wife objects to this
lady’s appearance with the union, because she is
independent enough to earn her own living. If a
few more women were brave enough to work for
themselves there would be less marriages of c?n-
venlence, with _ the usual Divorce Court ter-
mination.

Our old friend, RoJroFt BRrerale Doddle White, to

Albury made a start in the way of
Cinderella dances onWednesday night last—a grand
success being the result. The music was Inspirit-

the only fly in the perfumed ointment being the
conduct of a few—very few—gentlemen, who—
awl Well, don’t yer know ?—“nevah dance square
dances, old fellah”; not even when two or three
sets only wanted “ one couple more ” to enable
the Lanoeahs to be started Several ladies laid
claim to the belleship, which by many was con-
ceded to Mrs Dr. Kennedy, in pale-pink satin with
net trimmings and ostrich-feathers; Mrs. H. M.
Kalghcley looked quite rsgal in a rich black cos-
tume; Mrs. Abercrombie was tastefully attired in
black silk, and beautiful trimmings of broche and
net and old gold, beaded gloves; Mrs. Walker
Jones wore a handsome black velvet broche; Mrs.

The Woollahra Private Assembly was even
a greater success this month than on previous

a great many tickets were refused even at that.
The arrangements were well carried out, and the

tufted with deep cream chenille; Mrs. Russell, a
combination of ruby and pink; Mrs. M’Carthy,
crimson plush; Miss Roberts, cream silk and

The London Sportisg Times is an exten-
sively-circulated twopenny organ whose princi-
ples are sufficiently indicated by its motto, which
is “High Toryism, High Churohism, High Farming,
and Oid Port for ever.” Thus discourses the
1 xmbs aforesaid, whlrix, by the way, may be seen
under the arm or sticking out of the coat-tail
pockets of every second London masher whom
you meet in the London haunts of sport or the
drama:—“ What with Gus Harris, and what with
Sir Thomas Brassey, and what with the Prince of
Wales, these colonial visitors are becoming a trifle
of a nuisance. The royal enclosure was crowded
all this week till the rain oame, owing to 200 of
them having been pitchforked on to it by royal
command. Very decent fellows in their wav,
doubtless, these descendants of convicts and bush-
rangers, but why English ladies and gentlemen
are to be excluded from what amounts to a
national privilege beats us.” Very gratifying,
this sort of thing, for the thousand and one
grovellers who just now think they are “ promot-
ing Imperial Federation,” and making a splash la
the society of the modern Babylon.
They met in a hosier’s, and one was stony,
and the world knew It. Yet was he engaged la
buying silk pocket-handkerchiefs at a guinea
a-piece. “ Hang it, old man,” said his friend, who
was of a cautious disposition, “ aren’t you a bit
too hard up to be buying pocket-handker-
chiefs ” “ Hang it, to you. I am broke, but
I ain’t so broke that I can’t afford to blow my
nose.”
The N.B.W. Government are considering
a proposal, lately made, that a condensed weekly
authentic report of leading colonial events be
transmitted by cable to London. This is the sort
of thing which we fully expect to find sent
through to London once a week:—‘‘Sydney,

The second hearing of the Crawford
divorce ease has apparently wiped out Sir C carles
Dilke for at least the next few years. His anxiety
for a new trial resulted in the Anal smash up of
the Commandments which Moses first fractured
on Mount Sinai, and the evidence, which at the
outset only distinguished him as a ruffian, now
places him in imminent danger of a prosecution
for perjury. But though his character has been
completely demolished by his own evidence, it is
absurd to assert, as so many papers are doing,
that bis political career is finished. The wife-
kicking Duke of Marlborough is emerging from
his retirement like the sun from a cloud, and
“ Wales ” has extended him the claw of sincere
friendship, and lifted him once more Into
"sassiety”; Valentine Baker, too, Is undergoing
a carbolic acid process which will soon end
in complete disinfection ; he has been a
popular hero ever since he aided Chaklr
Pasha ia covering the disastrous retreat of the
Turkish army behind the Balkans, and robbed the
gallant Ottoman of his share of the glory. In the
same way tsir Charles Dilke will blossom forth
once more, and if his Liberal friends reject him he
will probably come out on his old Democratic
ticket, or turn Tory and hunt for a peerage. Even
in his early republican days his creed was of the
reversible order, and was not buttoned very tight.
When walking down Piccadilly, not so very long
ago, we encountered a huge plush flunkey, a gor-
geous compound of insolence and beef-steak,
carrying a bag marked “C. D.,” while his[ em-
ployer, the owner of those suggestive initials,
stalked along majestically in front. Sir Charles
went in for liberty, equality, and fraternity in
those days, but still he did not walk side by side
with John Thomas, and that prismatic menial
seemed a little out of keeping with his doctrines
Of republican simplicity.

COURTING IN THE COLD.
Now is the cold, cheerless season when the
gaunt wet wolf of Winter devours the last shred
of the Autumn lamb; when cool “shandies” are at a
discount, and gruel with a stick in it at a premium;
when the ice-cream merchant tratsforir s his tra-
velling barouche into a baked 'tater and hot
saveloy emporium, and when a prudent man
would as soon think of going without the back of
his head as without his waterproof and his pocket-
handkerchief This is no time to slcg the sweet
songs of love, and yet they must be sung ; for
love, like some of our Supreme Court judges,
knows no law. To our tale, however. 'Twas
night—a night that would chill the blood In an
Esquimaux chief who had been drowned ten days
—when the lovely Mary Jane Spottletoes, of Wooll-
ahra, hurried through the rain to the trysting-
place, at the rear of her stern parent s fowl-house
to meet Robert Peter Magubb, who had won her
maiden affections; though she never told her love,
but let it fted on her dam&sk cheek like a Sydney
alderman on a quarter of beef. Robert Peter was
up to time, Happing hig manly chest with his sema-
phore arms and doing impromptu sand-jigs to
keep his cerulean blood from fret zing. They met.
They encored the performance. But alas ! a
shudder ran through their veins. Robert Peter
felt as if he had just slid down from the
top of the North Pole, and Mary Jane was pain-
fully conscious of the fact that while her fond
heart throbbed with love’s fever heat, her nose
was swollen the s ze of a prize banana, end had a
glowing lustre on its retroussi tip that would have
done credit to a Collins street doctor’s door-plate.
« * «
They met once more. Robert Peter haying
found one dry corner in his blue banians, wiped
his eyes, and Mary Jane held in her disengaged
hand a handkerchief wet with her maiden tears.
Robert Peter was the first to speak. It is always
the male lover who, figuratively speaking, has to
“break the lee.” “Oh Bary Jade,” he cried, “I
have logged hor a bobendt such ts dla. I cub do
dell you dow ob-ker— shew-w-w-oh subd’g dearer
do me thad by life. Da tibs had come, Bary Jade*
when I bust—ho-RASH-ooohl Cu-THBASH-ooohl
I’ve gcd such an awful code.” “So hah I,” mur-
mured the trembling giri, as she fingered her
handkerchief round in the vain hope of finding a
dry spot. “Darlig,” began the warm, yet shiver-
ing lover again, “ you bust hah seed how mudge I
lub you—you bust. Wldout you I cannot—oik-
cik-THEBASH üb. I cannot ooh-ooh-cik-oik-ker-
Ohew.” “Oh heahedsl” sighed the fair young
girl, trying to look languishing; “this is huase
dan death.” “BaryJadel by ondy iub, look up;”
exclaimed the distracted lover. And then, lifting
her azure eyes to his, she gazed trustingly In his
poor, pained face, and said, “ Ker-ker-ker-ke-
TiSH-yu,” and then a Blue Mountain waterfall of
spray deluged Robert Peter from the pomatum
oil his topmost hair to the soles of his well-
soaked bluchers.

Order being restored, the amorous Ma-
gubb toed the scratch onoa more, and began:—
“Darligl Whad id hobe wldout a mother—l bean

here the maiden’s love oveeame her timorous re-
serve, and dropping her fair head, with its price-
less wealth of golden curls on her lover’s shoulder,
she threw her shapely alabaster arms round-hls
neck, and placing hdr coral lips to his ear, sweetly
murmured, “Oh, Robld Be ter I sher-sher-sher-kek-
kek-ah-twh ooonl ” Then the floodgates were
opened once again; and Robid Beter mentally ob-
served that he had never felt so thoroughly soaked
before since the days of Noah’s Deluge. To make
matters worse, tha fowls, finding their rest dis-
turbed, began to hold an indignation meeting,
and pass votes of censure on the lovers in tones
that threatened to rouse the whole street.
Accordingly, the unfortunate Robid and Bary
Jade moved further along, and got into a small
lagoon, where Robid, grasping hia subject and
his Bary Jade, once again began:—

who would gladly gib ebed lihe itself for you, an’
say will you be by owd, by darlig wife ? ’ Again
did the fairest of her sex encircle the neck of her
lover with her ivory hand, and again did she essay
to make him the happiest of men, when suddenly
her fairy Jorm beoame convulsed, her breast
heaved like the billows of an angry main, her
back curled fitfully up and down like that of the
Soudan donkey's when he’s trying to buck, and,
finally, she broke out intoja string of snee zos that
caused her trembling lover to fear she would be
scattered Into as many chips as the boy who was
ass enough to stand on the burning deck when the
rest of the crew had socoted. “Oh, by lub I

claimed the distracted Robid; “tell be bud one
word; will you be bide—speag—speag, lub, I
imblore you—bide—only bide-eik-eik-eik-howa-
rash-alooo I ’ This time it was Rary J ade who got
the free bath, and it seemed to bring her to a
trifle, for the managed to catch on to Robid by
both and sob: “ X bill, Robid—l hill.” Then he
jlrew her dear, damp form to his; their loving
eyes—those crystal windows of tie soul—gazed
tenderly, even pitifully at each other’s scalded
nose-tfis, and then fer ten solid minutes
there oame forth a sound on the silent mid-
night air like unto that of a cow pulling
her hoof out of a bog. or the popping of a
beer-cork behind the scents at a charity concert,
“ Heavig bless jou, darlig-I bust away,” sighed
the now happy Robid; ” all to nigd's woes bill

Kimberley from several private sources. Tha
mud is waist-deep at Derby landing-place; the
field is 400 miles distant from the latter town;
carriage is £3OO per ton; fever and ague abounds;
officialism is rampant; in fine, every evil is present
except gold—the root of all evil. The vaunted field
is a lie, a delusion, a fraud—ins man who goes

It is hard, very hard, for sneaking lip-
loyalty to suppress itself. Last week, Rev. dribble
preached in Sydney on the horrors of the North-
west, and a resolution was passed, commencing:
“That in the opinion of this meeting, after hear-
ing the statements of the Rev. Mr. Gribble— in this
the Jubilee Tear of Her Most Oraeious Majesty’s
reign— it is desirable that a Royal Brltlah-Aus-
tralian Commission should be formed to inquire,”
&c. What the jubilee year has got to do with the
state of aborigines in Western Australia, would
puzzle even the shining lights of the Y.M.C.A., or
the author of the glowing description of poor
Brown’s knees, to fathom. The next record should
be that Christian loyalists “in this happy year of
jubilee, are glad to learn that no Royal Commis-
sion has been appointed to convert those wicked
barbarians, who, like the Crawfords and Dllkes,
infest the society patronised by Her Most Gracious
Majesty and H.K.H. the Prince of Wales.” There
is room for a few thousand Gribbles in London—
and for a few hundreds of ’em in Sydney, too.
A DILEMMA.
They gathered at the muster-place With hallelujahs
strong,
To squelch poor old Beelzebub with sheepskin and
with song;
Then at the captain’s signal they all marched
along the street,
The lassies shuffled after them with hurried slip-
shod feet;
An ancient sister followed, sad and slowly in the
rear,
And spoke of Mood and sinners, and with low
words that seemed like prayer.
And there was one amongst them who but lately
bad been saved
From crooked ways (and Berrima), and now was
well-behaved;
And when the meeting-place was reached the
music ceased to play.
The erriog one took off his hat, prepared to have
his say,
Then drew his sleeve across his mouth and told the
people round
How good and happy now he felt since he the Lord
had found;
He wanted sinners, great and small, to be just saved
like him,
And find salvation—at this point with tears his eyes
grew dim—
When rushing from the gaping crowd a jovial
“ boozer”trod
Upon his toes, and murmured forth, “ So you’ve
got out of quod! ”
BRIEF MENTION.
“ L.O.L.”—Sir ’Eary’a revised version
"Helll Oh Belli”
Four deaths by suioide in Sydney last
week. Sydney Punch Is to be revived by Mr. W.
H. Hicks.
“ Curious find in a mine” is the heading of
a par In a Melbourne paper. They had found
some gold.
A Northern man declares that the pre-
eminent characteristic of Sydney people is dirt.
§p ? Well, then, the pre-eminent characteristic of
Northern folks is D.T. There now 1
A man in Victoria had his 80 year-
old father run in because he was childish, and not
of robust health. We are going to have our pa-
ternal progenitor arrested for gout.
A Jew has been fined for drunkenness in
Melbourne. He is about the first Hebrew on
record who has ventured to trench upon the
"Christian” privilege of making a beast of
oneself.
In Coonabarabran, N.S.W., a juror was
excused as he pleaded deafness. One of the others
remarked, “I can’t see how It matters whether
he’s deaf or not; he’s only got to hold up his hand
when he votes ‘guilty ’ or ‘not guilty.’ ”
A sporting butcher, at Ross Island (Q.),
challenges another resident, by advertisement in
the local paper, to kill a pig for stakes up to £lOO,
" the verdict to be settled,in.appearance, time, and
execution of work.” It is presumed that execu-
tion of pig will also be taken into consideration.
From the Newcastle (N.8.W.) Herald:—
“ The number of people who partook of tea at the
Orange meeting on Monday was about 700. We
mention this as, owing to a mechanical defect in
the final cypher, the number appeared as 70 in
yesterday’s issue.” Such is the reward of the poor
compositor who tells the truth by accident at
Newcastle.
Rev. and Mrs. John Alexander Dowie still
continue to go into Melbourne grog-shops to pray
people out of their thirsty propensities. Let the
persecuted publican take example by a hero of
the American whisky crusade, who let his groggery
for bedrooms. When the ladies started praying
the guests started about going to bed. and then the
ladies shrieked and left.
“There are two Scotties in Ooonamble—
Scotty the Wrlnkler, and Scotty the Whistler.
The Wrlnkler was drunk and so was the Whistler.
The former fell, and could not rise, so he called
out, " Help me up, ye whustlln’ dell, help me up.”
The poor whistler could hardly stand, so he said,
" Man, a canna; but I'll tell ye What I’ll dae. I’ll
lie doon aside ye.” Where, among vour so-called
Christians, will you find sympathy like that ?
At a recent football match in Hobart—
Melbourne v. Southern Tasmania-some onlookers
were horrified at hearing exclamations from an
excited R.C. priest, apparently quite out of keep-
ing with " the cloth.” Their feelings, however,
were much soothed by the discovery that he was
merely encouraging one of his flock who was
playing, by .crying, "Good, Goddard I” but a
tendency to lower his voice in the latter part of
the name oast a dreadful suspicion of profanity
on the reverend father.
"What must we do to be saved?” is the
enquiring title of a tract which was handed to us
last Sunday evening by a dyspeptic Hallelujah
mother-in-law. Through the kind attentions out-
side our bedroom window of an amorous cat of
the sex that votes, we were enabled to bestow
a large amount of thought upon the eonnundrum,
and have come to the conclusion that in order to
keep out of that locality where an ice-chest would
command millions one must join the Salvation
Harmy, wear a second-hand napless militia coat,
sell the War Cry, show as a trophy, become a
capting, run away with a brother officer’s wife, be
converted from a drunkard's life enco a quarter
regularly, and finally, before a large and unsoaped
crowd, relate " How I fell away from the Lord.”
An issue of the Sydney Evening News one
day last week contained another avalanche of one
horse, or rather one corpse obituary notices re-
lating to a dear departed one in the euphonious
name of—say Bloggs. There were no less than seven
reminders of the deceased one’s departure from
this vale of tears. Some beautiful verses attached
were well worth perusal, if only to show what
idiots are allowed to live on the outside of the
hospitals for the Insane. This is how we would
immortalise the subjects of such poems:—
Dearest Bloggs, we miss thee
From this vale of tears,
Pass around the whisky,
Drown our grief in beers.
Oh that death had taken
All your friends so dear,
Left you quite forsaken.
But right off the bier.
They do not seem to be “a purely loyal
crowd at Townsville iQ.). At the last meeting of
the local council, a circular came to hand from
the Mayor of Adelaide, requesting the members to
co-operate in according “Wales” a proper recep-
tion on his imaginary visit to Australia, and when
the document was read, Alderman Simpson—a
Scotchman, tool—rose and declared unanimously
that he did not cere one solitary twepenny cuss
whether “Wales” came to Townsville or not.
Then Alderman Stout got up and said that there
was no coolness or 111 feeling between him and
“ Wales,’’ and he was prepared to make allowances
for the prince, as he probably did not know any
better, but he objected all the same to be taxed
on his account. The rest of the council gazed at
these two disloyal persons with a stony glare in
its municipal eye, much after the style of Cain
when he sat down to inspect the unconsumed
pumpkin on his altar, and Anally, when the mem-
bers had done waiting for a thunderbolt to fall on
Stout and Simpson, they passed a resolution that
they would And a well-aired bed for “ Wales”
should he visit Townsville. The two aldermen
should have a statue.
Ninety-five juat men, residing at Single-
ton (N.S.W.), have forwarded a petition to the
Assembly which “humbly showeth” the follow-
ing facts:—"That your petitioners regard the
Divorce Bill presently before your honourable"
House as contrary to the spirit of the British Con-
stitution and the revealed will of God, and injuri-
ous to the people of this colony,” and they, there-
fore, desire that your honourable House will drop
the said bill into Woolloomooloo Bay, and "as in
duty! bound they will ever pray,” &c. Why they
should pray Is not exactly stated, though the
N.S. W. Assembly affords scope for a good deal of
devotion, but the point about the "revealed will
of God "is the most incomprehensible of all. We
were induced to hunt up the authority for this
statement, and at length we found it in the book
of Deuteronomy, sandwiched in between a com-
mandment which permits an Israelite to steal
grapes, and another which prohibits a man putting
a millstone up the spout. The law in question, we
find, permits an able-bodied male citizen to write
out a declaration that he divorces his wife, and this
being done he has only to open the door and tell
the lady to “ git.” After that she may marry
again as soon as she liker, and the only hardship
is that her former husband must not change his
mind and marry her over again. Read by the
light of Deuteronomy there does not seem to be
anything very dreadful about the N.B.W. Divorce
Bill; but perhaps the people of Singleton have
commenced at the beginning of the Bible, and
have only got as far as the place where Esau sold
his birthright for a cask of potash. Possibly,
however, some of these reverend gentlemen who
are so fond of writing -50 pages to prove the tre-
mendous differe ce between the north-east and
the south-west sides of a religious hair can ex-
plain away the Singleton petition to make it fit
the Scripture or plane down the knobby parts of
Demteronomy to make It square with the petition,
and then truth wfll once more prevail.
When Mr. Wise, in his recent lecture at
Goulburn, quoted Messrs. Hudson Brother’s estab-
lishment. near Sydney, as a proof of the advant-
ages of Freetrade, he seams to have hit on a
rather unlucky Illustration. A correspondent of
the Sydnev D.T. points out that th© shares in this
concern-13s. 61. paid up-are hard to sell at 5s.,
and adds that almost every industry in N.8.W. la
in a similar bad condition. Freetrade is not all
unadulterated joy.
There are more troubles on the road to
Kimberley than are dreamt off in the new-ohum
digger's philosophy. The wild and disorganised
native who haunts the route is bad enough, but
when that coloured brother gets tamed matters
grow worse. One of his favourite tricks is to sell
a baby-alligator to the dusty pilgrim on the pre-
text that the saurian is valuable as a guide to
water, and so apparently it is. But in a few days,
when the scaly pet has become tame, it wants to
come up and put its head in Its master’s lap, or if
it fails to notice it. it purrs and rubs its head against
the side-wall of its proprietor, after the manner
of a tortoise-shell house-pussy, and the result of
this fondness is generally fatal. One caress from
this pet reptile usually scrapes away about six
ribs and leaves the alligator's landlord with his
lungs hanging out at one side and the process of
digestion exposed to the public gaze. A good
many men are likely to disappear on the road to
Kimberley through speculating in these armour-
plated favourites.
In tbe debate on the Customs Bill in the
N.8. w. Assembly, it transpired than even In this
pastoral country of Australia butter is skimmed
off other animals than the cow. When the pro-
posal to tax this consolidated grease was brought
forward, Mr. Inglis pointed out that while butter
and lard were to pay Id. per lb, “butterine”
would be admitted free, and Mr. Brunker added
that the latter compound was largely imported
from Victoria r.nd sold as butter. Mr. Garland ap-
parently defended this s windle, and objected to
any duty whatever being imposed on the imported
article, real or sham, as only the cheapest kinds
came from other colonies, and the charge of Id.
per lb. would therefore fall on the working classes.
To anyone else it might appear that to class ta'low
and slush among “ the cheapest kinds of butter”
is equivalent to defining a pump as the most inex-
pensive description of cow, but nobodyappeared
to observe the incongruity. Finally the item was
passed, and as the result genuine butter will
henceforth be a dutiable article, while butterine—
though it may smell like the burning Cities of the
Plain—will frisklacross the border, as before, with-
out any liability, and then be christened anew
and compete with the pure article. This looks re ’
markably like offering a premium to unprincipled
Victorian persons who perpetrate vile outrages on
the cornstalk digestion, but it is only one item
more in the N.S.W. legislative muddle.
“The Confessions of a Thief,” by Joe
Bragg, form a notable addition to Australian
literature. The first part of this autobiography—
to be continued in monthly numbers—proves, on
perusal, to bo a threepenny paper-covered “ baa”
from the pen of a lost sheep Just returned from
the wilderness, and it is likely to be of Immense
benefit to the youth of the colonies. Joe Bragg
was once, we presume, a white-headed Sunday-
school Innocent, who recited pretty little pieces
about Mary and her little iamb, but he fell from
grace and concussed himself considerably In the
descent For 23 years he led a criminal existence,
and defied all the efforts of those who sought to
pluck him from tbe burning, but at length he has
been saved and takes his place among the slangy
cherubim who are warring against sin and
syntax in N S.W. In commencing his story
he mentions that before he was 17 years of
age he “bad committed thousands of rob-
beries and had been convicted about a dozen
times,” from which statement we are inclined
to fancy Joe is just now doing a prosperous
trade in the wholesale Ananias business. In these
early days it appears Mr. Brsgg was a “wire,”
and would often make a good haul when he
chanced to “pipe a boozington,” and was able
to “ keep his lamps on him.” He also did some-
thing in “snow-dropping,” but owing to ill-luck,
brought on by associating with a “ square-head,”
the “demon put plncher on him.” These facts
are of thrilling interest. As he grew older he
got into the higher walks of his profession, and
would often “ bash up to a bug,” assisted by one
or two other “guns,” turn him over and take the
money “out of his kicks,” though on one er
two occasions it happened that “ the bug gave
out the pay,” a circumstance which led to
trouble. In more than one Instance, too, Joe
“whipped the Jills” of bis associates, but
they “tumbled,” and, being “fly,” made some
difficulties regarding the “mug.” After reading
these enthralling statements, we can only regret
that this hallelujah “ bloke” cid not adhere to the
Evening News, which is the recognised medium
for such confessions as his for, in attempting to
tread the flowery paths of threepenny slush he la
wasting his sweetness on the desert air. In short,
he seems to have made a “ bloomer” in more wajs
than one, and unless there is more cherub and lees
Ananias in the next number of his autobiography,
his venture as an author is hardly likely to be
a success.
A Parisian spinster confesses to having
attended 600 balls In the effort to catch a husband.
....Mr. Stead, ef Fall Mall, has been hoaxed.
Some wag has sent him the names of the leading
Ulster football dabs, such as the . *■ Swifts,’ .
“ Olympic,” and “ Hangers,” and be seriously put
them all into his paper as ‘ Ulster Army”
brigades.... Vanderbilt has been blackballed at the
Paris Jockey Club....“l hear, at the Drawing-
Room. the other day, when one of the pages, as is
his office, gathered up the train of one of these
fair over-tea debutantes, she turned fiercely on
him and said, “See here, young man, none of

cost the city of Liverpool £14,863 to “ receive ” the
Prince of Wales. Thus do gluttonous grovellers
waste public money while the British poor are
slarving In dozens like sheep in drought-time
Many landlords are leaving Ireland with their
plate and household goofs — It is a curious thing
that a" The Claimant’s” eldefct ton (who has em-
ulated) bears a much stronger resemblance to the
traditional Tichbornes than does the acknow-

and who now finds himself, at the age of 31, a fairly
rich baronet.
A NEW BULLETIN POEM, BY POE.
Biddy Rooney—shipmates called her.
And she took delight
In the coat of dirt that walled her
Virgin charms from sight;
And her mouth was wide and roomy,
And her eyes were also rheumy.
And the agent brought her to me
Rather late at night.
I In stifling night of summer
Site in dusty room,
And I rose to greet the comer,
Handed her a broom;
All the scrubbing that distressed me
I forgot as Biddy blessed me.
Dreaming not how soon she’d best me
For a ’Dus horse groom.
Only spake this weighty tramper
In the Kerry tongue.
And she made the callers scamper
When our door-bell rung;
Boots it not to speak of smashing.
Naught I’ll say about the washing
Of this Celtic eolleeo, slashing,
Ruddy-haired and young.
But it same about one morning
At the hour of cream,
Waiting milkman’s yell of scorning
Burst In on my dream;
Every step but mine was whitened.
Every other door-knob brightened.
But my purse and wardrobe lightened,
And I, fragile, fainted, frightened,
With an awful scream.

perience. They overcome the worst form of
Diseases of the Liver, Stomach, Head and Kidneys.

THERE are many men In this colony who are,
day by day, melancholy, miserable, and a
burden to themselves, through early indiscretion
or over-indulgence. It 1s to those that this adver-
tisement Is addressed. Impotence drags Its victim
In Its unhappy train through years of suffering,
rendering his existence a misery. He sees his
fellow beings hale, hearty, and vigorous—in the
full enjoyment of manhood’s greatest privilege—
and naturally becomes despondent, seeking soli-
tariness, and shunning society generally.
He is lured into trying some of the So-called
Remedies, but without avail, and imagines he
must go down to the grave a hopeless invalid. If

be relieved and a Cure effected by a simple course
of this Invaluable Medicine, which will, in the

ment of the system—regenerating ail the im-
portant elements of the human frame, and en-
abling man to fulfil his most sacred obligations.

Know ye all men that Wolfe’s Schnapps has
no rival as a stimulant.
Lady Dilke is the latest society author in
England, and she has recently published a book
full of stories which are almost bad enough to
have been written by a prince with a wet towel
round his head. All her heroes and heroines meet
with violent deaths; they are either scalded with
a basin of hot soup, or fall iato a thrashing-
machine, or perish ignominously among the ruins
of a blazing cow-house, or something of the kind,
and the collection ends with a beautiful illustra-
tion of a skeleton that has stolen a black horse,
and is riding away in a hurry. There is not even
a kangaroo or a bushranger in the whole volume.
Wolfe's Schnapps— A medicine for body
and mind—A time honoured preparation.
The latest female fad with the bewitching
Bostonians is to carry a big cloth bag when “ on
the block.” Much ingenuity is expended in decor-
ating these receptacles by embroidery, and other
work. The bag may be carried in the hand, but
the correct Boston style Is to have it flung over
the shoulder, with one bulbous end hanging down
in front and another behind.
To cure all kinds of symptoms use Wolfe’s
Schnapps. Be sure you obtain Wolfe’s.
When Ere tempted Adam with the apple
there) Is no record of her having used even a leaf
on which to hand it him. We may presume, how-
ever, that, with feminine taste, she wcfcild do so.
Now, after the lapse of ages, modern Eves tempt
modern Adams with the fruit of mother earth,
but they know that nothing displays the rich pro-
duct so well as one of the pretty fruit-sets which
people frequently connect with the nann of Bray
Bros , whose stock is unrivalled. Truly women
are the best judges after all. *

than the Genoa Velvets which they so closely resem-

four times the price. For Costumes and

The ease with which the guard of a tramcar can
gllng his manly form from the street on to the
moving car just as the tail end of It is about to
disappear Into the infinite, invariably excites the
warmest feelings of admiration in some of the
gazers, whose hard lot it is to stand at a street
corner and wait till their own funeral proces-
sion comes along. Elderly gentlemen especially
are frequently fired with a notion they can do the
same thing. Sometimes they do, and sometimes
they don’t. A stout old party tried the experl-
msnt on one of the trams this morning, and just
as he was In the act of catching the fleeting guard
iron, he missed it I The spectacle was one well
calculated to Impress the mind of a scoffer with a
sense of his own worth. The passing moments
were filled with a kaleidoscopic review of alter-
nate ends of a fat man, an empty black bag, and
the luncheon and baby’s feeding bottle it had once
contained. A crowd gathered and fulfilled its
mission by staring open-mouthed at the victim of
an acrobatic ambition, clawing at the wooden
blocks, and rapidly getting off a variety of familiar
quotations not to be found among the nursery
rhymes of the present day. With the aid of an
intelligent constable who had hurried up to see
what he at first thought was a dog fight, the old
gentleman reached the nearest chemists. An all-
over application of St. Jacobs Oil speedily relieved
him of all pain, and in the course of half an hour
he was as good as new In all respects, save for the
rivulet of profanity which trickled from him as
he hailed a passing hansom and moved off to busi-
ness.

HE CIVIL SERVANT AND THE SERVANT
GAL I
Some few days ago a bright cheerful-looking
woman, attractive all over with the trifling ex-
ception of her feet, which were about six sizes too
large, knocked at the door of a suburban villa,
and speedily found herself face to face with a dis-
tinguished-looking buceaneer la lovely whiskers,
smoking-erp, and a pair of embroidered braces
hanging in festoons from his waist. Interrupted
in the act of chopping the family firewood, he
carried the axe in his hand, and the lady may per-
haps be forgiven for mistaking one of the bright,
est ornaments of the Sydney Civil Service for an
employee of the establishment:—
A long conversation ensued, during which Ifc ;
transpired that she was an applicant for a situa-
tion in reply to an advertisement in the daily
paper. Number of children? None. Washing
putout? Yes. Litedinner? Yes. Gas stove?
No; no gas in the house yet. Who trims the
lamps ? Mrs —. What kayrosane did tney be
usin’? Snowflake, of course. Was that good for
lighting the fire In the morning? “Don’t know,
we haven’t tried It yet; always use FFF gun-
powder here; we think it safer.” “Thin I’ll be
wishln’you good moraln’, young man; the place'
wouldn't suit mo.” And her No. 18 boots started
the spring violets up by the roots as she went
down the gravel path. This is a solid fact. The*
railway slationmaster can verify it.

BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
The crushing successive defeats of Neil
Matterson, Nelson, and Kemp by English scullers,
la bound to set Beach’s admirers wondering
whether the latter's “ championship ’ is n ff, after
all, an empty title. The two victories over Hanlan
which at the time seemed to stamp Beach as the
“sculler of a century,” had a big hole knocked in
them when the Canadian failed ip make a race of
it with Teemer. That last performance seems to
afford some proof that Hanlan. the phenomenon,
was no more. It is possible—nay, probable-that
Hanlan th<? Phenomenon had ceased to exist when
he toiled, or pretended to toil, after Beach on the
Parramatta River. And it must he remembered
that Beach's reputation rests solely upon that
double conquest over a man woo was, sub,e-
qnontly, quite as baoly beaten by a third party.
If, as many good judges believe, the Canadian has
lost all form and is only a ghost of what he once
was in a wage'-b: at, then we have no good line by
which to gauge the “ champion’s ” real capabili-
ties. The fact that he can beat such as Matterson,
Nelson, and Kemp, goes for nothing when we
find that they stand no chance against men
like Bubear and Perkins, The question, too,
naturally arises whether the smaller colonial guns
would tmve matched themselves to confidently if
they had not previously done something which
was considered satisfactory with the great Beach.
Kemp’s defeat by Perkins last week is especially
significant. With the examples made of h’s col-
leagues staring him in the face, Kemp must have
fairly tried himself ere tackling the confessedly
moderate Englishman. However cheap he might
have held English sculling form when he first
landed, Kemp could hardly have underrated Per-
kins’ powers on this occasion. The presumption
is that he overrated his own powers. Un-
doubtedly Kemp and the others have to some
extent taken Beach as their standard and been
“let in ”as the result. This is not reassuring for
Australia. Assuredly as their victories would
have enhanced the Dapto man's reputation, so
must their defeat dttract from it. However, It is
a little consoling to remember that the collapse of
Trickett was preceded and followed by the suc-
cesses of his trial-horse, Laycock. History may
bd Reversed in the case of Beach and his tria -
borses.

Speaking of the first of the matches, Aus-
tralia v. England, we remarked that the English-
men would find it hard to improve upon the Man-
chester 11, except by the substitution of Barnes
for Peate. That change was made, and one other
—Mr. Tylecote taking the place of Pilling behind
the sticks. The inclusion of a fourth amateur in
the team certainly didn’t strengthen it, lor Tyle-
cote enjoyed the distinction of making a duck.
But, on the other hand, Barnes came off alike
with bat and ball, and in such style as to fully bear
out our argument that no All England 11 need
Include a purely “one part" man like Peate.
For the first time on record the Englishmen played
without a tall, that is presuming that Tylecote
has not lost all his old batting form. The last man,
Uohman, came off in each of the three previous
innings he had played against the Australians.
The four amateurs, It may noted, scored only 45
runs between them, out of a grand total of 353,
and In the bowling department they were just no-
w here at all. Nevertheless, no purely professional
team ever seems to do as well as a Judiciously-
arranged combination, and this last combination
—barring always the doubt about Mr. Tylecote—
is certainly the strongest that could be procured
from the whole crowd of English cricketers. But
even admitting that, the poor show made by
“Our Boys” Is by no means satisfactorily
accounted for. We have been so accustomed to
laud their sticking powers in playing an uphill
game, that it takes us rather aback to find the
last seven wickets falling for 38 runs. When an
English team collapses in the same way, the home
papers are apt to talk about “ funk.”
A family “rejoicing in the name of Hig-
gins,” recently drove to the Corio Cricket Ground
(Geelong) to witness a friendly game at football.
At the conclusion of the contest, the Higginses
entered their waggonette with the Intention of
returning home. Sad to relate, however, the
horse, who had been a friend of the family for
many many years, and who is locally believed to
have landed in the colony with Batman, there-
upon commenced to kick and maltreat the vehicle
which it is his duty to draw, in a most malicious
manner. Moral: Do not take even an old and feeble
horse to witness a football match.

We may look forward next season to some
interesting racing in Sydney harbour amongst
those fashionable little flyers the 30 feet half
deckers. Golding, the builder of the two “ Nereus”
craft, which distanced all competitors until the
advent of George Ellis’ creation, the Genesis, has
a commission to build a new one to beat George
Ellis’crack, if possible, and as he intends to put
one together as powerful as the latter boat, some
good contests may well be anticipated. Toe
Nereus has had her deck removed, and one only
half the width is to be substituted, which will
give the sitters a lot more power on the boat when
“hang out” is the order otthe day. The* Clytie”
is also in Golding's hands, to be raised two inches
all along. This should make a lot of difference to
her, as hitherto she has only been the bottom of a
boat.

Articles of agreement have been entered
into between W. G George and W. Cummins to
run three races-distances, one mile, four miles,
and 10 miles respectively—each race to be for £lOO

fixed to take place last July 26; the second race
(distance, four miles) to come off on Saturday,
August 31, or Monday, August 23, as may be
mutually agreed upon; the third race (distance,
ten miles) to be decided on SaturJay, September
H or Monday, September 13, as may be mutually
agreed upon. In connection with his recent races
with Myers on a circus track, George says that he
is not a good clrcur-ho r se, but ha adds, “One
thing I would like, and that is to run Myers two
races (three-quarters of a mile and one mile), each
for £lOO a side, on a good cinder path.”

At Foley’s Hall, on Saturday night, Mr.
George Seale, the N.S.W. amateur champion,
made his first appearance in public, when opposed
by a first class professional, and his friends must
have been more than satisfied with his perform-
ance. Though knowing the amateur to be a clever
boxer, we were scarcely prepared for the masterly
show he made when opposed to an out-and-cuc
scienced performer, suoa as Peter Newton, the
middle-weight champion of Victoria. Mr. Ssale,
who fights equally well wit h head, hands, and feet,
made all the play, often leading on to Newton
with the right, and now and then bringing in his
left, one of which on his favourite spot,
“the mark,” nearly put the professional down.
Newton hit the amateur but three or four times
during the four rounds, one of the blows being a
vicious right-hander which luckily lor the ama-
teur landed on his shoulder, for had it been six
inches higher he would have collapsed for a
certainty. One of the amateur s best p ilnts Is the
manner he can “ time” or judge distance, and he
never showed it to better advantage than when
Newton, with his usually lightning like left, was
short in his leads.
We have seen all the best boxers perform,
one with the other (with the exception of Foley
and the amateur champion), on Foley’s stage,
during the past week, and the general opinion is
that Foley is still at the top of the colonial pugi-
listic tree. Larry, after repeated trials, has tailed
to get on a match, ana after a hundred and fifty
false alarms, he now says he has finally made up
his mind to ret're and make way for younger, if
not better men, with which object he Is giving a
champion-belt to be competed tor. With the ex-
ception of Foley, we do not suppose any man
knows what the ohampion amateur can do when
at his best with the mittens, and we have an idea
that the redoubtable Larry himself wou ! d not
oara to give away a chance in a ding-dong go with
his pupi l .

Jack Thompson says he is open to back
Larrv Foley, for 5000 dollars, to light John L. Sul-
livan to a finish, and he only asks for one little
stipjlatlon, which is, that Foley shall have an
hour’s conversation with Sullivan previous to the
fight. Thompson wants a soft thing for a cer-
tai ty; experts have reckoned that L rry would
talk a bullock into a premature grave in half

count for her record of speed. She certainly haa

shoulders not coming too soon for a fair turn of

The first of the intercolonial football
matches under Rugby rules between N.B.W. and
gueensland was played on Sydney Association
round last Saturday, when some 6000 spectators
put la an lappearanoe, la tho face of a wet and
cheerless afternoon. The game was evenly con-
tested throughout, and eventuated in a win for
Queensland by four points to two, a result which
made their curly skipper as jolly as a sandboy.
Tne dribbling of the Queensland forwards was ad-
mirable, and was well supported by the play of
the backs, which was so good that, although the
home team were defeated, they were not by any
means disgraced. Some alterit'ons are to be made
in the Sydney team for next Saturday, and, if the
best available men are picked, N.B.W. should just
about win.

It is cabled that the colonial sculler, Kemp,
was beaten easily on Saturday by English sculler,

September 18, but we shall not be surprised to
hear, before this appears ia print, teat no such
match has been ratified. Gaudaur is stated
by the latest Yankee flies to be a much im-
proved and now first-class man, with any
number ©f dollars at his back. Beach has
been hard at work on the river taking off a
portion of the two-stone of superfluous 11 sh
which he carried round the music-halls with him,
and the Engl sh people seem to doubt the efficacy
of his training in tho item of taking a heavy row

and it is to be hoped he will not be led away by
over-confidence. In the second race, Hanl.n had no
