Personality and Literary Fashion
The secret of style is personality. As
man is, so will lie write; but literary e
vironment has something to do with min
modifications of his manner. Because wri
ing is a social thing his pen must be set mo
or less to the tune of custom. A Stevenso
with the luck to be born into an age tha
suited him best, wrote with all that gra
of simplicity which revealed the child natu
in the heart of the man; but had he lived ir
the age of sonorous periods, when the wore
of Latin origin was preferred for sheer po
derosity to its northern equivalent, there ca
be no doubt that he, would have caught muc
of the fashion of the time. Stevensoniar
might easily have been the equivalent o
Johnsonian if the places of Stevenson anc
Johnson had been chronologically reverses
but the change would have been in reali
superficial. Johnson would have beer
heavy in a simple way; and Stevenson wou
have been graceful and delicate in an art
ficial way. The personality of each ma
would still have shone through the wor
and it would have possessed just the life tin
each possessed. It is impossible to fool tin
all-revealing thing, language. The writ
may trick and deceive himself, but he ca
never quite trick and deceive his pen. Thei
may be truth in wine, but there is certainl
truth in ink; for the turn of a phrase anc
the making of a paragraph will reveal tl
secret of the heart, though it be a flat con
tradiction of the words written.
It is this very quality of literature whic
has led to fashions in writing and many in
dividual eccentricities of manner. The r
vealing nature of ink gives to all writing
sort of nakedness; and only the very earnes
or very daring really desire to give their ow
personalities so completely away to th
reader. In journalism—where the respec
ablp counts much more than it does in endui
ing work —a uniform has been adopted. Thi
uniform takes the shape of a shibboleth o:
set phrases; and, wearing it, the averag
leader-writer can not only conceal his iden
tity but successfully hide the fact that h
has anything fresh or vital to say. But i
literature the clothing of literary fashion i
always too thin to hide the writer. The eve
sway of his periods—the fashion had shiftec
a little from the full Johnsonian plate armo
of Latinism—does not hide the real Gibbon
You catch the sound both of laughter and o
tears in his careful relation of fact. A sen
tenee rises tipped with scorn; another i
edged with mockery ; a third has the fin
feeling oL admiration. And yet they all ru
with much the same movement, easily bai
anced, moderately prodigal of words, clear
meaning and most remarkably suited fo
reading aloud. To-day the tendency is to
wards mildly barbaric decoration. The write
does not appear so anxious to hide his per
sonality as to disguise it. The good fabric
of grammar and the stout thread of con
struction are less in favor than formerly
The interjection and the unformed or
broken sentence are much in use and corres
pond to the shark's-tooth necklace of the
savage; but behind them an altogether unex
pected personality often shows —a person
ality steeped in convention and hysterically
crying that it is not conventional.
The method of literary fashion—-its means
of propagation and growth—is not difficul
to observe. Somebody with a decoration o:
beetles’ wings round the thick part of his
literary abdomen has something to say which
instantly gets a hearing, either from the
general public or from the literary circles
themselves. He does not get this hearing in
the first place on account of the beetles’
wings, but in spite of them; yet immediately
among, the lesser fry of literary aspirants
there is a boom in beetles’ wings, Beetles’
wings become an established fashion; maga-
zine editors look for them; critics use them
as a standard of judgment. The fashion
lasts till . sbmebody arrives with hibiscus
blossoms in his hair; and then the other
fashion slumps and nobody has any more use
for it. But all the time there are people who
will not conform to fashion of any kind.
Some of them walk stark naked in a literary
sense; some wear the best of the very ancient
fashions bravely and defy every change of
opinion. The writing of worth generally gets
through in spite of the mode of the moment.
If the personality revealed or only partially
hidden is a pleasing one it gets a hearing the
more readily; if it is a very ugly or grotesque
one its success is certain. But the proportion
of personality to the other vital matter of
something to say is important. A few writers
have much personality and very little to say.
When the chief thing that strikes the literary
reader about an author is his style, that
author’s place is a very unsure one. The
best style is that which does not obtrude
itself. . When the matter of an article or
story is found wholly absorbing, when the
taste of it lingers on the tongue and quota-
tions from it seem a delight to make, there is
rarely a word said about its / style.
Afterwards the reader discovers that the
style of the work that so charmed him
is almost superb, but it is always an
after discovery. The secret of style is
personality, but literature is social; and the
best style is of little worth unless it is the
medium for saying something vitally worth
while.
DAVID MCKEE WEIGHT.
The First of the Flowers
Book-reviewing is a ticklish occupation.
The likes and dislikes which have a chance
of making a man’s matter worth while are
taboo: he is a judge—above all enthusiasms;
not the gentlest bee that hums may lodge in
his bonnet. If he makes himself a standard
of technique and slates or praises according
to its dozen rules, in one week he receives
four thundering good books to review, every
one of which disobeys every one of the
rules. And in the next batch two techni-
cally perfect books are not worth a damn.
And so on. Anyone who has got this far
can supply the other million causes of the
ticklishnoss of the occupation.
Edward Shanks, the fiction-critic of the
London MebCUBY, for instance. When the
Mebcuby came out about four years ago,
despite the flagwagging and triumphal music
of its birth we all thought it was a good
thing. The buck that used to go into “Squire
on Shanks” and “Shanks on Squire” wou
probably postpone its becoming a dear o!
thing for some years, at least, we though
And that was true. We got good, keen crit
cism, unfrilled, only faintly tainted by ’Va
sity, and often with a new thing to sa
Certainly most of the things were said fou
times when a properly-grouped once wou
have done; but, most of the readers beii
journalists, naturally no one complained o:
that. The reasons for a good deal of ti
verse are as yet an English secret; but po
sibly the average quality of the nationa
output puts that beyond the editorial cor
trol. The main endeavor was, one judgec
to prevent the vast shadow of impersona
solemnity from darkening the effort; and
that important matter the editor and h
associates were triumphantly successful. Y
in the ticklish business of criticisrp a wors
thing than impersonal solemnity may befal
too much sprightly, capable personality, fo
example, which has not so good a reach
the said vast shadow, however skilfully
may vivify the literary magazine.
In last December’s issue of the Mercur
Mr. Shanks criticised “The Judge,” b
Rebecca West; that is to say, a fain
hearted chat about the book lifted occasion
ally to an expression of opinion. “Di
appointing,” “laboriously exercised techniqu
of analysis,” “deliberate, manufactured, som
times to the point of being mechanical,” am
so on, stiffened once into “But ‘The Judg
is a diffuse and loquacious book; and ii
psychology is often strained to breaking
point.” A long quotation was wrenchec
from its intimately important context;
couple of pars, commented neatly and satir
cally upon the theme of the story ; and tha
was all. This critique is not published i
the Tatting Gazette or the Bee-keep
ing Annual, but in the London Mercury
whereby many thousands of critical readei
order their reading and keep abreast of Eng
lish letters. To these readers it is eviden
that Miss Rebecca West has written an ovei
loaded story, too loose, pretentious ■ anc
strained to be worthy of inclusion in thei
library lists.
Now, “The Judge” is beautiful. More
over, it is the first true flower to nod, seeml
and healthy, on the battlefield of the ole
manner and the new; -which makes it
literary event of importance. In this splen
did book the two expressions meet and ar
merged for the first authentic time; froir
it the real new will arise quietly and natu
rally, and taking, as it must, its respectfn
dignified help from tradition. Here is th
beginning, the first flower of the Spring
For 20 wintry years the armies have swep
back and forth over this field, settin
up kings and dragging them down
bringing heavy artillery of tradition t
blow the Fourth Dimension to blazes
yelling a wild battle-cry that the old was
liar and that only sex-mania was the touch
stone of truth, raising such an evil tumul
of pro and con. that a quiet corner whereii
to earn your living honestly was a nearlj
impossible thing to find.
Miss West found it, and -wrote “Tin
Judge” in it, which must have been a grea
happiness to her. She allowed psycho-analy
sis (exercised not in the least laboriously)
to light up the dark hiatuses of charactei
(which the old manner dodged and in self
defence called uninteresting), but never to
dominate or obsess her characterisation
Psychology (not in the least strained) con
trolled justly and truly the actions and re
actions of her people’s minds, but under the
old manner’s strict direction of her “story.’
Quick impressionist flares shot up to show
for a moment that her background was as
alive as her foreground; but under tradi-
tion the background stayed at the back.
Long Symbolist fingers plucked significant
moments out of the past which, unadorned,
threw a high light on the present and the
future of that character, byt always in the
stride of the epic story. In construction
“Oedipus” is not more terribly inevitable;
in color Hergesheimer is comparatively
almost drab.
Of course, one is only saying this; but
every time a man says a thing over his
name he commits himself. And there is always
the book to confirm him or label him a
fool. Willingly one stakes an alleged repu-
tation on the result—on the faith that yon
will find in “The Judge” all these things
and much more. The beauty of each fleeting
moment singing passiohately in words. The
beauty at the heart of a rain-washed, ugly
street, at the heart of a girl’s awakening
sex-anger, at the heart of intolerable sorrow.
The beauty of the glad reception of death
conquered by ldve. And smaller things: old
women to whom a gift of roses comes, the
recurring call of adventure, remembered cor-
ners of gardens—all the little things which
shift in and out of the mind unexpressed
and only half-felt, but which makes the dif-
ference between blindness and vision. Not
written in soft superlatives, nor “dreamily,”
but in strong, nervous English which slips
easily and nonchalantly from one deep trea-
sury of thought to another, with never a
backward glance to note how well it is
being done. With all the good short cuts
of the new filling in the strong framework
of the controlled and ordered old —the essence
of beauty in literary expression co-ordinat-
ing the new and the old techniques.
The vast shadow of solemnity, egregious
and impersonally dull as it may be, could
not have missed that co-ordination, however
it would deprecate one’s use of superlatives.
They are mere opinion ; but the recognition
of that miraculously skilful merging is the
critic’s business at its barest.
HILARY LOFTING.
What is Psychology?
This queer book (What is Psychology? by
Charles W. Hayward—an Edinburgh doctor
with most of the alphabet after his name—
Allen and Unwin) does not fulfil the promise
which you at least hope for when you pick it
up. So far from being a simple text-book
of that branch of knowledge which I got into
such trouble for calling a. “pseudo-science,” it
turns out to be an enthusia.stic demand for
the general recognition of Cougism as an aid
to medical and surgical practice. Combining

BALATA
BRITISH
BELTING
“The Belt is running for the full U hours, and 'ls giving full satisfaction.”
(Extract from letter received from the Trufood Co. of Australia, Ltd!.,
Melbourne, Vic.)
The above illustration, drawn from an actual photograph, shows
a big 20in. x 8-ply Dick’s Balata Belt operating in the large and
modern works of the Trufood Company of Australia, Ltd.,
Melbourne. The sizh of the driving pulley is 12ft., and the size
of the driven pulley 43in. The speed of the driven pulley is
300 B.P.M. The horse-power being actually transmitted is 200,
although the arc of contact with the small pulley is approx. 110°
instead of 180° as recommended.
This big DICK’S BALATA BELT is standing up to reputation —delivering
maximum power 21 hours per day, at minimum cost. There are no belt
troubles no costlv breakdowns, and no losses through labor thrown! idle.
The Engineer’s labors are lightened, the efficiency of the power plant
increased, and steady output is ensured. Why not standardise on DICK S
Balata Belting in your plant?

this with indications of real scientific know-
ledge that Dr. Hayward gives, I think I ara
only right in calling it a queer book, though
well written and deeply interesting. Or
course the real objection to Coueism is that
it is very doubtful whether that part of the
unconscious mind which is liable to sugges-
tion has anything whatever to do with that
nervous organisation which is supposed to
control heart and arteries. Dr. Hayward
uses the term psychology not as denoting the
name of a science, but rather as most people
use “personality” or “character.” Other uncon-
ventional terminology includes “hysteria” for
“neurasthenia,” and “superman” in a sense
that Nietzsche would have been horrified to
see. The Nietzschian superman was sup-
posed to be a man above the common level of
slave-morality, not, as Dr. Hayward seems
to think, a “better” man in the platonic
sense. Of course it was simply Nietzsche’s
insane reading of the Darwinian theory of
the struggle of life, under the utterly mis-
taken idea that the struggle in man was
carried on with the tooth and claw of the
beasts. If Darwin is to be misread by such
a lunatic as Nietzsche, then all truth goes to
the wall. Nietzsche, of course, was adjudged
insane even in his lifetime, and the product
(in part) of his ravings, the Great War,
seems to prove the judgment right.
Coueism, if I may be allowed to give my
considered opinion as a result of considerable
experience, answers quite well with children
and young women; but when you come to
deal with a real, hardshell, hardened, old-
man sceptic it fails lamentably, even though
tried to the uttermost. Baudouin himself
admits that doctors, even in the favorable
environment of Nancy itself, are very hard to
succeed with. And it is indeed difficult to
find any doctor who is not a profound scep-
tic. His infantile primitive instincts are over-
laid by years of education and clear-eyed ex-
perience of the world, and his deep-seated
unconscious mind is too hard for Coud to
reach. In men of the world the auto-
suggestions of Coue rather seem to stir up a
“conflict” which does probably more harm
than good; and in matters of therapeutics
doctors are most emphatically men of the
world of empiricism, of experience. That
makes the marvel of Hayward even more
wonderful than the miracles of Hickson and
Coue, though the last two miracles are
widely different from each other in truth
and honesty.
But where Dr. Hayward’s book is interest-
ing is in his idea that the world may be re-
generated in a few years by suggestions to
the very young infant, after the manner of
Coud. Hayward eloquently describes the
troubles under which the world is now suf-
fering ; he thinks that if mothers would only
suggest to their children the ideas of abso-
lute truth, good-humor, unselfishness and fair
play the world in a few years would be a
very different place. Unfortunately all
mothers do not want their children to grow
up with the ideas of truth and British fair-
play implanted in their minds. Possibly
Russian mothers may aim at far different
ideals; and it is only fair to imagine that
they will work upon their children’s uncon-
scious minds quite as vigorously as Dr. Hay-
ward's ideal mother will be able to do. After
all, the ideas of beauty, wisdom and goodness
are not unalterably the same in every lati-
tude ; and the mighty power of suggestion is
quite as open to be used by mothers, whose
ideals of such things are widely different
from those in a gentle old Scottish doctor’s
mind.
Still, though you will get from this book
no idea of what I so rudely called a “pseudo-
science,” I do think that if we practise
Coueism upon the children from their earliest
infancy we shall very soon see an immense
improvement in the world. And to that ex-
tent this is a book well worth reading. But
if you want to get at the real facts about
psychology you, will find Tansley’s “New
Psychology” more useful, or Wilfred Trot-
ter’s “The Instincts of the Herd in Peace
and War,” a book which is so extraordinarily
well written that you almost doubt if it is
really true science. I know Dr. Trotter per-
sonally, and have always found him an
exceedingly sensible and learned man with
not an illusion about him.
C. McL.
An Epic of the Air
F. M. Cutlack divides his Australian Fly-
ing Corps (Angus and Robertson) into two
parts, a little less than half being devoted
to Palestine and the rest to France. The
style is carefully restrained. The writer
has had to compress his tremendous story
into some 400 pages, and the contract has
left him no room for heroics or digressions.
When the World War began Australia
had only four air-pilots. In February, 1915.
the Indian Government sent an SOS call
for airmen and flying machines, and the
best the Commonwealth could do, as it did
not possess a solitary serviceable aeroplane,
was to send Lieutenants Petre, White, Merz
and Treloar. These officers —the Mesopo-
tamian Half-Flight—-were the genesis of the
Australian Flying Corps, a body which was
to win world-wide fame for its battle quali-
ties and to be notable also as the only organ-
isation of the sort provided by any of the
Dominions throughout the war. But the
A.F.C. was a long time coming, and an
unfortunate outcome was that many keen
young spirits, disheartened at the lack of
opportunity afforded by their own country,
went to England. Cutlack remarks: —
There were many Australian pilots in the Royal
Air Force, just as there were New Zealanders, Cana-
dians and South Africans. The percentage of over-
sea men among the British pilots has never yet been
authoritatively stated, but it was remarkably high.
It is said that in the earlier part of the war the
number of airmen from all oversea dominions
amounted to over 50 per cent, in both the Royal
Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps.
In June, 1915. the members of the Meso-
potamian Half-Flight were merged in the
R.F.C., and at the battle of Ctesiphon, to-
wards the end of the year, only one Aus-
tralian flying-officer remained. Not till the
middle of 1916 did the first Australian flying
unit (No. 1 Squadron) arrive in Egypt, and
even at that late date Australia possessed no
machines and no technical equipment—all
had to be supplied by the R.F.C. The end
of this year saw the arrival of No. 2 Squad-
ron, the command of which was given to
Oswald Watt, a Sydneyite, who had had a
distinguished career in the Aviation Mili-
taire section of the French Foreign Legion.
The Australians had begun to take to tne
air in numbers, and they showed a peculiar
aptitude for the work. If the soldier’s wage
is honors, then it is certain that these won-
derful young men were most villainously
sweated.
This book, like so many other honest war-
histories, indicates that the Hun was not
hated nearly so much by those who fought
him as he was by the noisier patriots at
home. A warm friendship existed between
the German “ace,” Felmy, and the Austra-
lians whose one aim in life was to kill him.
When not on professional business _ Felmy
and the Australians corresponded—chiefly on
the interests of war-prisoners—in a spirit
that recalls the highest traditions of medie-
val chivalry.
The scene changes to France. Squadrons
2, 3 and 4 of the A.F.C. (then known as
68, 69 and 71 squadrons R.F.C.) arrived m
Flanders in time for Cambrai. The person-
nel had all been trained in England in the
improved machines which were now gain-
ing an ascendancy over the Fokker, and
according to methods which had been learnt
at the cost of hundreds of gallant lives.
No. 2 (Watt’s) Squadron was in the Third
Army, and so participated in Byng’s unsuc-
cessful tank attack near Flesquieres on the
morning of November 20. The business of
the flying-men was to bomb the likeliest tar-
gets during the advance of the tanks and
infantry, and then fly up and down the
roads and trenches bombing and machine-
gunning. “It was risky work,” observes Cut-
lack, “for the heavy fog meant that flying
had to be done at only 20 or 30 feet off
the ground; but the rewards were great.
Lieut. A. J. Pratt delivered his bombs upon iwo
heavy machine-gun emplacements, and then shot up a
considerable stretch of the main Cambrai-road. Lieut.
F G. Huxley dropped one bomb plumb upon a gun
moving out of action, machine-gunned the men round
it, and shot three of the horses dead. Having next
blocked the road into Cambrai by smashing in simi-
lar manner a supply waggon, he flew on through
the mist, and suddenly saw a body of 300 enemy
infantry drawn up in fours. “This parade,” he re-
lated afterwards, “was dismissed quicker than parade
ever was before.” Lieuts. Holden and R. L. Clark
made direct hits with bombs on a communication-
trench full of troops, and then fired into the result-
ing confusion until such men as were able left the
trench and fled. Holden returned to an advanced
landing-ground behind Harris Court Wood with his
machine a flying wreck. Every part of it was shot
full of holes, including petrol-tank, tail-plane, both
longerons and part of the under-carriage, while the
elevator control was shot clean away. Lieut. Ward s
machine being disabled by ground fire, he was
forced to land behind the German lines, broke his
leg in so doing, and was taken prisoner.
Holden and Huxley got M.C.’s out of
this series of Homeric teats; Pratt, dark
and Ward nothing.
And so the roaring diapason of warfare
swelled and swelled in Flanders till it
reached the climax on March 21, 1918: —
Soon after dawn a pilot landed at a British
aerodrome, white-faced and shaking with excitement.
“There are thousands of them —thousands and thou-
sands,” was all he could say. “The whole country-
side is alive with them, all advancing.” Every aero-
plane in the vicinity took the air, loaded with every
kind of bomb, emptied the explosives on the nearest
body of enemy infantry, blazed off its machine-gun
ammunition info grey masses at close range, and
then returned for supplies to repeat the attack.
During the months of bitter fighting that
followed no arm was more constantly em-
ployed than the aerial one, and the A.F.C.
advanced in efficiency, and kept all its old
resource and daring. By the time the Armis-
tice came the Half-Flight of 1915 had
swollen to four squadrons containing some
of the most renowned fighting airmen in
the world.
It is four years now since the A.F.C. came
home on the Kaiser-i-IJind, and Australia
is again without pilots trained on modern
lines, and without a single modern aeroplane.

Reticence in Literature
The habit of confession is ineradicable.
Rousseau, Casanova and Cellini set an
example which to-day is followed by George
Moore, Arnold Bennett, Marie Bashkirtsett,
Margot Asquith and countless others. But
how half-heartedly such people follow' the
footsteps of their models! Though H. G.
Wells “educates himself in public” and Hil-
aire Belloc gives his hates to the world,
most of our writers have effectively hidden
their private lives under bushels. We know
less about G. K. Chesterton’s life than we
do about that of Shakspeare. Galsworthy
always preserves a rigid detachment; it
was only recently that we knew anything
at all about W. H. Davies; we are still in
the dark about De la Mare and Hardy. A few
such as Samuel Butler, Kit Morley and
Masefield have supplied fragments of bio-
graphy, but in most cases where the
temptation to talk of self intrudes
we have either the bumptiousness of
Bennett or the shallow egotism of
Thomas Burke and W. L. George. Barrie,
most garrulous and fanciful of writers, tells
of everything save those things in which
the world is most interested. Joseph Conrad
has yielded to friendly pressure and given
“A Personal Record.” Much personality
is in it; but of record there is mighty little.
In these 250 pages we learn—what? How he
wished to go to sea when a boy; how he
wrote his first book; how he passed his
first examination at the age of 24; how he
paid a visit to some Russian relatives; how
he joined his first ship; and how some con-
founded woman interrupted him while he
was engaged in writing “Nostramo. One
gets the impression that he is struggling not
to reveal, but to suppress.
What has Robert Bridges told of himself,
or Synge, or Henry James? They have the
reserve of Meredith or Sir Thomas Browne.
It was not till last year that W. B. Yeats
burst the shell of his modesty and revealed
what he thought of his colleagues and com-
patriots. Even then he refused to write on
anything that had not happened in his early
twenties. Everyone, it seems, among our
finer artists, is suffering from a thin skin.
Where is the effrontery of Wilde or of
“Jimmy” Whistler? Only Max Beerbohm,
among the more interesting personalities, is
the possessor of a “sheer delicious damned
cheek” in confession; and his admissions,
like Lamb’s, have so interwoven fact and fancy
that the “incomparable Max” rests safely
behind the veil. We want to know more,
and we want to know it of those few for
whose reticence the ill-considered frankness
of W. N. Barbellion is a poor substitute.
QUENTIN POPE.
Dante
As smites, beneath a livid lightning’s leap,
Tense on the vision, a wild midnight sea,
So Hell aghast, in throes of agony,
Strikes on our shuddering spirits and sinks
deep
Never to be expunged. O souls that weep,
O slaves of passion quivering with one
plea,
From sequences of sin you cannot flee,
The harvest of your sowing you must leap.
Poet supreme and Pontiff of the seers,
Though steeped in anguish, swathed in
thunderous gloom,
Yet dost thou lead us to the heavenly spheres
Where virtue fails not to increase in bloom,
Where love hath every joy untouched by
tears
And wisdom leisure dark truths to illume.
N.s.w.
ARTHUR ALBERT BAYLDON.
Walter de la Mare
Many an Australian bookshelf would be
the richer for a few slim volumes of Walter
de la Mare’s poetry. He is one of England’s
sweetest singers, and though comparatively
unknown in Australia ranks in Britain with
Masefield, Hardy, Drinkwater and Yeats.
One has to admire this gallant band of poets
whose sane and conscientious work contrasts
with the crazy affectations of the so-called
“modernists.” In fighting for their ideal
they have encountered fierce opposition.
London literary circles have embraced the
cult of “modern poetry” with the same exces-
sive enthusiasm that artistic circles have
embraced futuristic Art. A writer has but
to produce something wholly unintelligible
and he will find his genius applauded from
one literary society to another. Conversely,
the work of such men as De la Mare, Mase-
field and Yeats is condemned as common-
place.
I always associate Hugh McCrae with De
la Mare. His verse has the same lulling
fascination ; the same lilting melody. McCrae
is perhaps the more involved of the two; his
verse calls for closer study. De la Mare
strives ever for simplicity. His phrasing is
delicious. I imagine him deliberating for half
a lifetime over the right word to express a
thought. And b.is thoughts are beautiful.
Listen to “Nod” (from “The Listeners”),
and feel the drowsy sweetness of it: —
Softly along the road of evening,
In a twilight dim with rose,
Wrinkled with age, and drenched with dew,
Old Nod, the shepherd goes....
His are the quiet steeps of dreamland,
The waters of no-more-pain,
His ram’s bell rings ’neath an arch of stars,
“Rest, rest, and rest again.”
Exquisite! It is to children of all ages that
De la Mare makes his biggest appeal. His
poetic soul is the chaste soul of a child. All
his verse is marked by a great goodness and
simplicity. He does not pose as a teacher
of goodness ; he simply believes all the world
to be good. From his writings one imagines
that he has never come in contact with the
ugly things of life. His children’s verse in
“Peacock Pie” recalls Barrie at his best in
“Peter and Wendy.” Listen, again, to
“Martha,” the storyteller: —
Her voice and her narrow chin,
Her grave, small, lovely head,
Seemed half the meaning
Of the words she said.
“Once. . . .once upon a time”....
Like a dream you dream in the night,
Fairies and gnomes stole out
In the leaf-green light.
De la Mare in verse, like Barrie and Alger-
non Blackwood in prose, faithfully
the songs in a child’s mind, and captures child-
hearts in a moment. When I have children
I shall educate them on De la Mare. His
poetry will tell them a beautiful story, and
when the pain and disillusion come after-
wards, it will seem all the more beautiful to
Hi’s prose is distinguished by a polished
style and a delightful sense of imagination.
I heard him lecture at the Birkbeck College
(London), and found him the very man one
would expect from his writings. He is in
his early fifties, and extremely shy and un-
assuming. A dreamer and an idealist
would that the world held more like him!
GILBERT MANT.
A Satchel of Books
Alcatraz, by Max Brand (G. P. Putnam’s Sons).
More “Wild West” literature, and a shade better
than most, though it wears the badge of all the
tribe, with Alcatraz, a wonderful horse, thrown in.
An also-wonderful girl, of course, and a young man
suspected of being a tenderfoot, but who, also of
course, isn’t. Three hundred pages of raw excite-
ment, anyhow, winding up as you know it must.
Sidelights on Criminal Matters, by John C. Good-
win (Hutchinson). A compendium of the tricks of
criminals. The devices of shoplifters, the methods
of counterfeiters, and Science’s latest aids for the
elevation of burglary to a place in the fine arts,
not to mention the practices of poisoners, magsmen,
blackmailers, pickpockets and lesser fry, are set
forth plainly for the warning of the foolish. The
author regards the safe-breaker as the king of the
profession, because his occupation involves more
daring, more adroitness and resource, and is always
being 1 made more difficult by the efforts of the safe-
maker to beat him. The combination lock is no
longer invulnerable to the expert, and no steel made
can resist an oxy-acetylene attack, wherefore the
author comes to the conclusion that the best pro-
tection for bank vaults is an adequate human guard,
such as the Bank of England has -where also, by
the way, there are arrangements t flood the vaults
if this drastic step should be called for. The book
contains many good stories about the audacity of
criminals. The forgery of Old Masters is given as
one of Italy’s thriving industries; and in America
there is a college for the production of blackmailers,
where among the subjects taught are deportment,
the art of conversation, and the cultivation of a
magnetic personality.”
“T.P.”: The public response to the Henry Lawson
Memorial Fund can hardly be regarded as anything
but disappointing. May I suggest to the executive
that it should (1) get Australasian children to work,
bv permission of the Directors of Education, on the
lines of the phenomenally successful Vic. state
Schools’ War Relief Fund; (2) get a few leading
writers to collaborate in an appeal to the 240 editors
of the Australasian press, keeping in mind that the
strength of the united country press is greater than
that of the metropolitan journals; (3) get the Com-
mercial Travellers’ Association to give the movement
its backing; (4) tackle public libraries and debating
and literary societies; (5) give the big shearing-
sheds and the out-back pubs collection-lists to display.
After all, the toilers were Lawson’s keenest admirers,
and their half-crowns and shillings are available ; it
only needs organisation to collect them.

(fl In the realm of Motor-car service and efficiency
the Wolseley leads because of characteristic
construction and engineering skill. In addition
to attractive appearance and excellent design
the Wolseley offers constructive and mechani-
cal features which are unique. It is these
features which emphasise its value to men who
want a car that is absolutely reliable on all
roads and which gives the maximum in
comfort and service.
€J Built by the world-famous English engineering
firm, Vickers, Ltd., the finest Vickers steels
are used. This ensures strength, durability
and reliable service at all times and under all
conditions. The mechanical details of a
Wolseley are accurately fitted and well
finished, reaching the highest standard of
English engineering skill.
m Wolseley Spring Suspension is unique. It
eliminates road shocks, increases the life of
the car and ensures maximum comfort.
Convincing evidence of the wonderful spring-
ing of the Wolseley is afforded by this fact.
We have no record of a broken spring on a
7, 10, 14 or 15 h.p. car in spite of the most
severe road conditions which these cars have
experienced.

“Most Economical Car
Ever Owned.”
A West Australian owner writes:—*
“I will be having my 15-h.p.
Wolseley painted and done up this
coming Spring, but, before this is
done, I think it is advisable to pull
down the engine for a thorough
overhaul. I have done 20,000 miles,
so that I think it is wise to have
piston-rings in case they are required.
Please forward me as many as you
think I will want.
“This is a very suitable car for
this country, as this car of mine is
the most economical car up to date
that I have ever owned.”
The experience of this owner is
emphatic proof of the dependability
of the Wolseley. It is that very
quality which makes it an economi-
cal car to own and to operate. Make
yourself acquainted with every unit
that gives driver-confidence, owner-
satisfaction and passenger-comfort.

'• A CREAM possessing
an abundant lather,
capable of softening the
beard in 60 seconds.” That
surely will be your ideal of
a perfect shaving formula
—an ideal which you can
realise, as others have done,
by the use of Palmolive
Shaving Cream.
Palmolive multiplies itself
in lather 250 times. Thus
the slightest amount —barely
half-an-inch—suffices for a
shave. And there is enough
for 152 shaves, nearly 6
months’ supply, in every
2/6 tube.
The lather maintains its
foamy fullness for 10 min-
utes, and yet it acts so
quickly that within 60
seconds, the toughest beard
is soft. Bubbles are tiny
but tenacious. They sup-
port the hairs, hold them
upright, so that the razor
goes through them and
not over them.
The soap, due to palm and
olive oils, acts as a soothing
lotion which allays irritation;
cleans the skin, inside and
outside, and leaves it smooth
and velvety. The after
effects are delightful.
As Palmolive is the World’s
leading toilet soap, so also
Palmolive Shaving Cream
is the finest shaving cream
yet created. It is qualified
to realise your ideal. Be

H E vigilant control that is essential to maintain a standard
of highest quality has time and again compelled Packard to
build or to process for itself the things that a less exacting
standard could procure elsewhere. It is probably truer of
the Packard plant than of any other automobile factory,
that it builds more of its product in its own shops, with its
own men, under its own system for constantly controlling
the quality of its work. And this has been so for years.
Most importantly, for instance, Packard manufactures
Its OWN transmission.
Its OWN engine.
Its OWN rear axle assemblage.
Its OWN carburettor.
The search for defective material is unceasing. Each shipment of stock that enters the Packard factory is
accurately analysed and checked against specifications before it is permitted to enter into the various produc-
tion processes.
The quenching, the forging, the boring and grinding, machining and welding and burnishing, by which the
changing metals finally arrive at their appointed pattern and dimension, each is done in the Packard tradi-
tional way. These are the principles which underlie the construction of the New Packard Single Six. It is
a quality car of exclusive workmanship and design —but its moderate price will agreebly surprise you.

rust.
Only the steadfast suns among the stars
Remain unchanged. So in this world of
ours.
Years pass and Time drops all things from
his mesh —-
All save those names nor he nor change dis-
bars,
Where bloomed in all the fullness o.f their
powers
The loveliness of women not all flesh.

Magic Sands.
When no more leaps my heart at thought of
you,
When singing birds no more can pierce it
through
With ecstasy that hurts for very joy,
When bread of toil the appetite can cloy,
Then Age is here. The wine of Life is done ;
Through Time’s glass all my magic sands
have run!
When morning no more brings expectancy,
When moonlight wakes no thought of Love
for me,
When sunlight and the little, laughing clouds
And all that with strong life the long day
crowds
No more my pulse can quicken —then pale
Death
With ghostly hands may rob my throat of
breath!

Storm.
I.
When the great winds in long and wild stam-
pede
Leap o’er the sandstone battlements and
beat
The distance with a hundred thousand feet,
There is a sudden movement in the weed,
The great trees stoop their tawny necks and
heed
The neighing 'thunders, as in haste to greet
An ecstasy tempestuous and fleet
That for a moment gives them life indeed.
Mad is the dancing then of all green things,
Wild shouting and the clap of leafy hands.
The forest has a million tongues and wings;
The stiff, bound fibre in the trunks is stirred ;
Each grey-green bough becomes a living bird
An u swings and soars and loves and under-
stands.
ii.
When I have grown as quiet as a tree,
Sometimes across the bastions of mind
There is a sudden cry, as if the blind
High region beyond thought’s wide empery
Were stirred by tempest; and borne down on
me,
Heedless of all that I have groped to find,
Sweeps a full tide of knowledge, warm and
kind,
That lifts me, thrills me, sets my spirit free.
Then the stars sing together, and all lands
And seas are with a lyric sweetness filled ;
A great soft wonder flows about my hands
And makes a dancing music in my heart....
Till I am on a mountain far apart,
Lifted in dreams to more than I have
willed.

Sea-Color.
“Her eyes, her eyes,” they said to me,
“Are as the color of the sea!”
Color of seas a-swoon with dreams!
I visioned miles of filmy blue —-
Pale, land-locked bays in mellow creams
And caves with sunlight filtering through;
Gold-shadowed seas of cloudy white —
Mirages of unguessed delight—
And mirrored skies
Remembered too !
(They said her eyes were like the sea!)
I saw within a golden net,
Long lines of lapis-lazuli
Where curling cloud and water met,
A depth of blue such as I know
In crowded beds where larkspurs blow
And lupin-buds
Long-opened. Yet
There came to me still depths of green
That went through every limpid shade
From bronzed moss where rust had been
To almond-green and glowing jade;
And all the emeralds that spread
Above the peacock’s tufted head
a dream of pure
Enchantment made!
Sea color ! Then, against the rim,
Patches of purple dark like grapes.
I saw, unfathomable, dim,
Beneath a sky all hurrying shapes
Drowned beds of pansies royally dyed,
And broken violets on the tide
Around the points
And little capes.
What color was the sea? I saw
It rippling on with lazy flecks,
Wind-ruffled where the breeze sucked raw,
And opalescent like the necks
Of grey wood-pigeons. Pool on pool
That lapped against sardonyx cool.
And fish that seemed
Just silver specks.
And though her eyes were like the sea
Their color is a mystery !
VICTORIA.

WHERE ARGUMENT IS FOLLY.
One of the origins of the disaster which
threatens Europe, if not the world, is the
cherished fallacy that nations think as
nations, and in terms of morality. Their
leaders say they do, partly to justify their
own crimes, partly because the rank and file
of every country derive comfort from the
idea that they belong to a righteous race;
but that is about as far as the thing goes.
Germany, according to its present spokes-
men, defaulted over its reparations payments,
not from a desire on their part to test exactly
how much trickery the world would stand,
but because, with all the will in creation, the
people could not provide the money. France is
in the Ruhr, according to its spokesmen,
not with the object of dominating Europe,
but in order to collect its dues in ai legal
manner. Britain, according to a third lot
of spokesmen—its own—is concerned solely
to see justice done between the parties.
* i* w *
A great truth, which makes the pacific sen.
timents and protestations of goodwill on the
part of visiting foreigners so valueless, is
that nations rarely get the chance to think
or act collectively. Like companies, they
are soulless. Their policies are formed by
directors, acquired more fortuitously in many
cases —Bolshevik Russia is one—than could
happen in the case of any reputable com-
pany. Germany’s foreign policies, for example,
have been dictated by a few strong men ever
since it first emerged as a Power. For cen-
turies these potentates were soldiers—Bar-
barossa, Frederick, Blucher, Moltke,
llindenburg. Since the World War mili-
tarism has gone out of fashion, and the con-
science of the nation has been in the keep-
ing of a handful of over-lords who rely
not on man- but on money-power— Thyssen,
Stinnes, Iyrupp and eight or ten other great
syndicate heads. Their methods of achieving
what they call ‘‘the nation’s aim” are dif-
ferent, but the spirit is the same. The Hege-
lian theory that “natural rights” do not
exist, that the State (through its rulers)
creates the only rights which the citizen is
called on to assert, and that such rights and
obligations may vary from age to age, and
even from year to year—these convictions
were entertained and acted upon in the
palmy days of the Holy Roman Empire.
The politicians of the old Prussian State did
not pretend to be actuated by love of the
people or to primarily consider their in-
terests: they were loyal to a class which was
symbolised by a king. Their inspiration was
pride, a restless longing to aggrandise a
Court, and through the Court their own
order. Frederick the Great never kept his
word or told the truth where he considered
it profitable to do otherwise, and many of
the best political minds of his race have
always agreed that no other methods are
practicable in world affairs. “In concluding
treaties,” observed Treitzschke, “the State
must be the sole judge as to whether it is
expedient to respect its obligations.” France
is confronted with that spirit to-day. The
post-war German leaders—with the excep-
tion of Ratiienau, who paid for his ideal-
ism with his life —have consistently shirked
attempting to pay the nation’s war dues. As
in the time of Frederick, the national
policy was not framed for the benefit of the
nation—-the poor have been ground to the
earth in misery by the policy of the money-
lords as they were formerly by the policies
of the war-lords. No one has profited from
it but the profiteers. When the war ended,
the real Germany, the inarticulate mass
which politicians ignore in the interests of
what they call “the nation,” longed for no-
thing so much, probably, as the opportunity
to work off the monstrous debt with which
their fool-rulers under the Imperial regime
had loaded them. They could have done it,
and in the process made Germany the in-
dustrial mistress of the world. In natural
resources—minerals, land, timber—and in
the productive power which is represented
by industry _ and technical skill, Germany
was in an infinitely better position than,
say, Britain to start upon the rough journey
to solvency. But the money-lords could not
go straight. By rigging exchanges, by run-
ning the national railways at a loss, by
exempting the great industrial concerns from
their fair share of taxation, by allowing
huge secret reserves to be invested abroad,
it was thought to bilk France, and enrich
the modern equivalents of the Hohen-
zollerns. The swindle failed, with the re-
sult that France has the Ruhr; that the
German Government could not now pay,
probably, if it wished to; and that Krupp
and other instigators of the policy which has
given France the excuse it wanted are in a
worse plight than the ex-Kaiser.
The French have been more united on the
Ruhr issue from the beginning than any of
the other nations. So much so that, almost
alone in the world, they may be said to be
represented fairly by the. actions of their
politicians. They do not intend to let Ger-
many up again. And when the time comes
to admit it they will be in a position to
argue that a German thinker was the first
to insist on a theory of which their policy
is the logical outcome. “There is room on
the European continent for only one domi-
nant Power at once,” said Hegel. The
French do. not believe in the bona fides of
the financiers and manufacturers who, in
the name of the German people, have brought
Germany to the verge of chaos. At bottom
they are no doubt grateful to these blun-
derers for having delivered the Colossus into
their hands ; but they refuse to credit them
with goodwill or principle. And it is not
likely that these shrewd people will be im-
pressed by the moral attitudes the British
Government is striking, in the name of the
nation, but in the interests of the loud-
voiced section that wants to resume trade
with Germany. No better instance of ill-
judged sermonising could be offered than a
passage from last week’s Note: —
Though his Majesty’s Government is by no means
satisfied with the performance, Germany, in fact, has
paid in respect of reparations and the cost of the
armies of occupation more than twice the amount
exacted from France in 1871.
Germany’s claim on France 50 years ago
was not for reparations: it was an indem-
nity claim in respect of a war which lasted
six months, and was waged entirely on
French territory. France’s claim on Ger-
many is for damage done to property of
every description over a period of four years.
That is the distinction which the British
Note overlooks, and the fact will certainly
make its authors appear in French eyes as
special pleaders for those British business
interests which want to see Germany power-
ful again.
It is unlikely that Germany will go Bol-
shevik under French pressure. The Ger-
mans had their chance to declare for Soviet-
ism, and, after a glance at. Russia, decided
for civilisation. The more probable outcome
of the crisis will be a repetition of history.
France broke up the old German Empire
at the beginning of last century: it appears
to be destined to disintegrate the new repub-
lic in this century. What is certain is that
pro-German propaganda in British com-
munities will not affect the issue. All it
can do is to adversely affect our friendship
with a nation which was our friend in the
worst storm we ever faced. It is useless,
not to say ridiculous, to talk of moderation,
restraint and the rest of the moral virtues
during a desperate jungle struggle ; and, de-
spite the teachings of Christianity and the
arrival of the League of Nations, the ethics
of the Powers are still those of the tiger
in search of food.
TO EVERY DOG HIS DAY.
“So every Dame shall have her Knight,
And every Dog his Day.”
—From an obscure ballad.
No one has been saying more than usual of
late concerning the prospect of Japanese
aggression, or any other aggression, in or
near Australia; in fact, hardly anything has
been said for a long time, and interest in
defence matters has languished almost to
vanishing-point in consequence. Still, a per-
fect passion has developed in certain quar-
ters for declaring that the defence which
doesn’t exist is wholly unnecessary, and
almost amounts to an insulting suspicion,
and that the things which haven’t been said
are just the sort of things that are calcu-
lated to put evil thoughts into some pure-
minded people’s heads, and may justly aggra-
vate them to hostilities. These protestations
appear superfluous, unaccountable and
mistimed. A typical sample was lately
written for a Sydney daily paper by one
Sadlek, “Professor of Oriental Studies” at
Sydney University. This gentleman stated,
among other evidences of peace, that the
Japanese is naturally a fighter, and that the
country “has been administered by military
men for the last 1000 years, ever since the
establishment of the Shogunate by Mina-
moto Yokitomo about the end of the 12th
century.” Having this record, and having
quite recently come into possession of the
most up-to-date weapons and started on a
career of expansion, the brown gentleman
is plainly harmless! Further, the Professor
explained that “about 55 per cent, of the
population of Japan is engaged in agricul-
ture, and cultivates only about per cent,
of the whole area of the country, the rest
being mountains.” This was, apparently, in-
tended to be reassuring, too. If, however,
a mere 75 per cent, of Japan, instead of
per cent., was mountain, the pressure of the
mostly agricultural population on the arable
25 per cent, would be about 1600 to the
square mile. What would a warlike people,
crowded to that extreme of poverty, be
likely to do?
* * * *
The Professor’s appeal to historical
analogy was especially interesting : .
During the whole time I was in Japan I can hardly
recall any mention of Australia being made there....
The country people in Japan probably do not know
it exists. They know that America exists well
enough, and it is not at all uncommon to be saluted
in American in the most remote mountain villages
by some worthy who has been there, made money,
and come back to his native hamlet....
Anglo-Saxons may think it natural to take up their
abode in a far-off territory and make a home there,
but eyen in Europe they are rather peculiar in this
regard. The French, whom the Japanese greatly
resemble in many of their sentiments, have never
been successful in colonising distant places.
The fact that a nation has passed out of
the colonising game, or has not yet very
decisively entered it, is the poorest sort of
proof that it is an extinct volcano, or no
volcano at all. The dazzling story of French
colonisation in “distant places” should be
known even to a professor who is accus-
tomed to be addressed in American among
the fastnesses of Japan. France was in the
colonising business, along with Spain and
Portugal, long before the home-keeping
Anglo-Saxon woke out of his lethargy. Its
failure to hold command of the seas cut
its career short, but the persistence of a
distinct French race in Quebec (where the
French birth-rate leaves that of the Anglo-
Saxon out of sight), and in Louisiana, these
being the two ends of the old and prosperous
French-American dominion, proves that the
race has staying qualities as settlers. In
later years half-a-million French citizens
have located themselves in Algeria, which
is something of a record for a moderate-
sized colony with a large and warlike native
population. Other countries which have had
their day of adventure include Italy, which
had two of them, first under old Rome and
then when microscopic republics like
Venice, Genoa, Florence and Pisa did things
abroad that only Great Powers are supposed
to be capable of; Greece, Norway, Denmark,
Holland, the Hanseatic League, and, of
course, Portugal and Spain, the marvellous
pioneers of exploration and settlement and
the original finders of most things worth find-
ing. In fact, almost every country of Europe
has had its day of expansion, save composite
States, such as Belgium, Austria and Swit-
zerland.
The Anglo-Saxon came into the business
so late that his oldest foreign possession,
Newfoundland, was familiar to French,
Spaniards and Portuguese 80 years before he
took it. He originally arrived in England
by sea, and then so completely forgot about
the sea that when real marine races began
to harry his shores he had hardly a ship
available for defence. In later times he was
occasionally dragged abroad by his Norman
masters as a foot soldier, and in the capacity
of a refugee he was slightly known in some
foreign armies. But for quite a number of
centuries, despite his recognised courage and
other qualities, he showed much the same
home-keeping instincts as the domestic hen.
Then his time; came for waking unexpectedly,
and he woke with great success. Should
Japan find a suitable occasion and begin to
move on a large scale, it wfill be no more
anomalous than it was when Spain and
England got out of their homely rut. Should
Japan go conquering with no more excuse than
that it has a use for other people’s property,
the event may be very unpleasant for other
people, but the nation will have no more reason
to be ashamed, provided it succeeds, than
Spain was about Cortez, or England about
Elizabeth’s great maritime plunderers, or
France about the captains who once held
rule from the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of
Mexico. The difficulty ahead of the next
strong colonising Power is that there is now
no desirable empty land available, except
that part of Australia north of a line
drawn from a little above Brisbane to
Perth. There is even a lack of fer-
tile regions sparsely inhabited by ill-armed
savages of the Red Indian type, whose extir-
pation no one could seriously object to. In
short, a new world-Power, if it aimed at
colonisation on a great scale, and didn’t pro-
pose merely to live precariously among con-
quered races, might be compelled to make a
clearance of local tribes who read the morn-
ing papers, and attend races, and occasion-
ally go to church. Yet even in this it would
be merely following Saxon precedent, for the
conquerors were certainly no more than the
social equals of the conquered. Still, these
are mere details. The main point is that
national awakenings are ordinary events, and
that a stupendous national career of annexa-
tion and settlement is an honorable thing pro-
vided it comes off, though it may be a ridi-
culous one if it fizzles out at the very begin-
ning—at least, it is honorable when the pas-
sage of years has mellowed down the details.
So no one need affect holy horror if Australia
takes strenuous precautions against the possi-
bility of anyone planting a new flag here,
just as Captain Cook did in the century be-
fore last. The Australian army and navy
was at least as inefficient in Cook’s time as
it is now.
POLITICIANS AND THEIR SUPER-
STITIONS.
The gabbling persons who live on the game
of Australian politics have many ideas in
common. Whatever their labels and the
means by which they arrived in Parliament
—faked selection-ballot or favor of National-
ist clique; a name like Finucane or a firm
stand against Rome —they think and act
alike on nearly all the important subjects
with which they have to deal. They all
believe in borrowing furiously to absorb the
unemployed, and in buying votes with rail-
ways, bridges, billets, doles, pools and guar-
antees. They all agree, likewise, that en-
during prosperity is only to be achieved by
taking poverty-stricken people from places
like Stepney and Surry Hills (where they
have never grown anything in their lives),
and shoving them “on the land” at Pos-
terity’s cost. Sometimes this operation is
described in high-flown speeches as “solving
the problems of Australia and the Empire.”
One of the factions into which the profes-
sional politicians are nominally divided is
strong for “extending the economic func-
tions” of a theoretically infallible State. An-
other faction, while professing to deride the
principle, has made it the basis of numerous
light-hearted experiments. As a result, the
Prime Minister went down to the House of
Reps, last month and said that the Com-
monwealth shipping line, which cost
£14,156,000, was now reckoned to be worth
£4,718,000. Also, that the loss on two years'
operations was estimated at £2,797,000.
* * * *
Another Minister announced last week
that the Commonwealth had wasted
£1,628,000 on building 7966 war-service
homes, mostly by day labor. Likewise, that
further heavy losses could not be avoided.
Further, that the £1,628,000 didn’t include
a sum of £541,000 taken from the consoli-
dated revenue for administrative expendi-
ture, nor was the economic damage caused
by such fantastic tricks as buying up timber-
mills and shutting them down in a few
months taken into account. The mad pranks
referred to were played in Queensland, with
the result, in the Minister’s words, that
promising townships have been almost de-
populated and business-men —all taxpayers
till nationalisation came along—ruined. A
third Minister has placed it on record that
half-a-million has been sunk irrecoverably in
the Government fruit-pools. A similar
amount is admitted to have gone in running
the Government cattle-stations in Queens-
land. As for the Government wheat-pools,
none of which has been finalised, although
the first of the litter is old enough to be
going to school, the N. S. Wales Minister
of Agriculture states that the 1920-21 pool
cost his State £968,367 —this because a
Labor Government guaranteed 7s. 6d. a
bushel for vote-buying purposes—and that
the 1916-17 calamity is £855,789 in
debit, while a further £549,214 is in
dispute. The 1915-16 arrangement is
supposed to be £88,625 to the bad, but the
worst will not be known until all the war
pools—Victoria, S. Australia and Westralia
had them, as well as N. S. Wales —are
wound up. They are always going to be
wound up “at the end of the year.” The
burden of these wasted millions lies heavy on
Australian industry. It is an inescapable
charge on the revenue from taxation, and
this at a time when industries once prosper-
ous have drifted out of the taxpaying stage
—when canned fruit is selling at 2jd. a tin
less than the cost of production, and the
export trade in frozen beef is kept alive by a
bounty, and manufacturers of machinery and
textiles are being hard hit by foreign com-
petition, and the mineowners in the one
considerable gold-producing State have im-
plored the Commonwealth Government to
come to their assistance. But there is no
sign of contrition among the chattering
dunces who built the pyramid of folly. There
is every reason to fear that they will build
it still higher as soon as they get the chance.
* * * *
Australia is under-supplied with the kind
of citizen who knows his job and finds con-
tentment in doing it thoroughly. It has a
saddening over-supply of the sort that aban-
dons or neglects the work that lies under his
nose and the tools that lie under his hand for
pursuits of which he knows nothing, or the
little which is worse than nothing. Of such
are the politician, wiio considers he has a
GOD-given capacity for running trawlers,
steamships, cattle-stations, freezing works,
implement factories and all manner of pools;
and his willing victim, the city clerk or day-
laborer who goes on the land believing that
farming comes natural to a man, like eating
and making love. Elwood Mead remarked
on the latter superstition at the Pan-Pacmc
Congress last week. Being a guest of the
nation, Dr. Mead couldn’t say all he evi-
dently would have liked to say, but without
quoting concrete cases he referred to the
"utter folly of ignoring the experience and
capital of the would-be settler,” and “the un-
fairness of permitting people to embark with-
out aid and direction on a kind of agricu!
ture the conditions of which are strange
to them.” Continuing, he said: —
It is no kindness to a settler to accept him unless
he has a capital equal to at least one-tenth of the
cost of the completed farm, and 25 per cent, would
be a safer proportion. The anxieties, the uncertainties
and the privations which payment of interest on ihe
entire cost of such an undertaking imposes are greater
than the average man can survive. No State settle-
ment scheme which accepts settlers without capital
can expect to escape serious losses. If a settler can
walk off a farm without losing any of his own money
he is likelv to do so if there is a crop failure, or if
distant hills look more green. The settler without
capital should begin as a farm-worker.
These are the conclusions of a man who is
admittedly one of the world’s greatest autho-
rities on closer settlement. Their soundness
has been demonstrated in one political land-
boom after another, but the men who misrule
Australia never learn. The N.S.W. soldier-
settlement scheme and the Westralian group
settlements, to mention only two recent in-
stances, were started on the theory that the
embryo cußivator needn’t have capital or


experience on setting out, since the Govern-
ment would furnish the one and he would
acquire the other. The result in N. S. Wales
is that 40 p.c. of the 10 millions expended
to Jpe 30, 1922, is a vanished asset. Thus
far there hasn’t been a clean up in Mit-
chell’s State, but the president of the
Farmers and Settlers’ Association has voiced
haunting doubts. In a well-ordered country
land-settlement, would be left to those who
supply their own experience and capital (the
first by serving an agricultural apprentice-
ship, the second by the practice of thrift),
and industry in general to those who know
how to carry it on. Instead of trying to
make farmers out of penniless persons in
sedentary occupations the Government would
stimulate settlement by means of a carefully-
framed tax on land values, and encourage
production (all sorts) by means of a scien-
tific tariff and an income-tax fixed as low as
possible. But Australia isn’t a well-ordered
country. Before it becomes orie there will
have to be a revolution of political thought,
issuing in a new breed of public men.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Drink and Other Sins.
The slum problem of Empty Australia natu-
rally concentrates in Sydney, the place that
is growing faster than any other city of
that empire on which the sun never sets.
Some of its working-class municipalities
now beat the record of every British. provin-
cial city for closer settlement, and apostles
haunt these areas, trying to diffuse the
gospel, when the real need is to diffuse the
inhabitants. One who ministers in the
localities where there are as many as 83
humans to the acre published this little piece
the other day : —•
It is not always a question of better hoines. We
come across many children through our. strcet-
missior.s who are suffering from malnutrition, starv-
ing in some cases. Their homes are bereft of all
comfort.... This is not because the parents are not
receiving good money, but because they spend nearly
all they earn in drink and gambling. I can take you
to a man and wife and six children living in three
rooms, yet the husband is earning probably £6 a
week. In another house of eight rooms there are
living, or existing, four married couples, one adult
and 17 children.
At census time, N. S. Wales had 120 coun-
try municipalities with fewer people per
acre, and 54 shires with fewer people per
square mile, than that average per room.
So it is something to possess the most rapidly
growing city in Geokge V.’s dominions.
Apart from the lack of knowledge of a trade,
which is not the trouble with the three-
roomed gentleman on a £6-per-week basis,
the great causes of misery are drink and
horse, combined, of course, with two-up;
and drink isn’t the most pervading of these.
Absolute lack of accommodation helps to
explain overcrowding, but it doesn’t explain
the unfurnished homes and the starving
children. No man can drink £6 a week, or
if he attempts it he speedily loses the capa-
city to earn £6 or any other definite sum
per week ; but to lose £6 of one’s own money,
or £6OO of trust money, on an afternoon’s
pursuit of the elusive steed is too easy to be
worth mentioning. The consumption of
alcohol can be closely estimated, for revenue
officers keep a sleepless eye on manufacture
and importation. An official comparison of
seven countries, published in 1920, declared
the Commonwealth to be a very moderate
drinker compared with the United Kingdom,
France and Germany, and almost a tee-
totaller compared with the United States.
Another official return attested that the Aus-
tralian consumption of spirits diminished
from 85 gallons per 100 persons in 1913 to
36 gallons in 1921, and there was no increase
in wine and beer consumption to make up.
But no diminution in gambling has been
noticed —especially in the record of trials for
embezzlement. The disappearance of hotels
is continuous. In 1921 N.S.W. had 940
fewer pubs than in 1890, and in proportion
to population it had little more than one-
third as many as in 1890. In Victoria the
process of cutting them out has progressed
even faster, and both States are putting on
extra pace. No corresponding decline in
race meetings and two-up shops or in the
number and circumference of bookmakers lias
been noticed. The hours of liquor-selling
have been diminished as well as the number
of sellers, but when the five-day working
Week became fairly common in and around
Sydney the pony courses opened for their
squalid trade earlier on Saturdays, so as to
separate the working fool from his week’s
wages more thoroughly. Not so many years
ago the rich maker of, or dealer in, wines,
spirits and malt liquors was a feature in
Parliament and in public life generally. He
is rare now, but the man who made his
“rise” out of horses or card games isn’t,
and the twomp shopkeeper or pony-course
proprietor has picked up the portfolio which
the brewer dropped. The perambulating
publican is rare, but if the locality is even
moderately accessible the starting-price
bookie is a regular visitor, and the two-up
expert often lives on the premises. A recent
tale of mean streets related to a woman
whose nominal means of support was
employed on one of the State’s “permanent
and reproductive” undertakings. The reason
why no support eventuated for 10 weeks;
was that at every pay the recipient tried his
luck at the national game. He was an
unfortunate gambler, for he was cleaned out
every time, and it was done so promptly
that his average run was 15 minutes. This
country is considerably haunted by Yankee
“evangelists,” from a land of “saloons”
(not even poor hotels, but mere drinking-
shops, and some of them of the all-night
variety) and illicit liquor, and with a pre-war
habit of consuming over a gallon of spirits,
17 gallons of beer, and a good deal of wine
annually per inhabitant, including the baby.
They collect a fair amount of money for
mistaking Australia for a. place like their
own or what their own used to be. But the
Australian Governments have been, and are,
putting in much good work on the drink
evil without outside aid. If they could do
as well on the gambling problem and pro-
vide early closing for the horse, this would
be a better country.
Wanted: A Better-Breeding Campaign.
If Australia is to pay its way with its pro-
ducts-—which includes the payment ot in-
terest and redemption on its enormous
foreign debt—it is time the Commonwealth
sat down and took note of what is happen-
ing in the livestock department of primary
production. General Chattvel, Inspector-
General of the Military Forces, reported re-
cently : “The remount order for horses for
India, a mere 4000, though divided among
13 experienced shippers, took many months
to fill, and some thousands of horses were
rejected.... It is obvious the standard of
riding-horses is deteriorating, and , that
breeders are doing little to prevent it.” An
authority on the great cattle-country of
North, Central-North and North-Western
Australia says: “In another few years this
belt will not be able to market a prime beef-
bullock.” Any and every day dairy-experts
tell of the low producing qualities of our dairy
herds, and anyone familiar with either the
suburban dairy or the country dairy-farm
knows that 50 per cent, of the stock would
grade as culls. Of pigs and fowls the same
tale of physical and productive degeneracy
may be told; while the nightmare of in-
ferior wools that sat for long on the chest
of Bawra. is a regular feature of wool-
market reports. Well, what about it? We
have to purchase goods and pay debts abroad
largely with these products. More, we are
sending a Prime Minister to England to ask
for preference for them. Blown back over the
road he goes come reports of how Denmark
has built up its dairy yield.and the quality
thereof; of how Argentina is striving with
new blood and by culling to improve its beef
cattle; of how the old voertrekkers of South
Africa are steadily building up their wool-
flocks with the best filood procurable. As for
Russia, it exported 175,000,000 dozen eggs
to England the year before the war; and
when the rest of Europe settles down, poultry
and eggs and cheese and bacon and butter
will pour into England. Then what about
it? During the recent season Czecho-Slova-
kia/ Italy, Algiers, Egypt, China, France,
Denmark and others poured eggs into Eng-
land. When Russia and Siberia and the
Black Sea trade opens again, what amount
of preference that England can give will
avail us if the quality of our goods is in-
ferior? Our universities, taking a spell from
turning out lawyers and doctors, might well
lend a hand in propaganda in which De-
partments of Agriculture and Education
should join to teach our rural producers the
evils of haphazard breeding from mon-
grel sires and cull dams. Almost as badly
as anything this country want a Better-
Breeding Campaign ; and in its organisation
there is work by which the Bureau of Scienqe
and Industry might justify itself. If some-
thing of the sort is not done the standards
of the livestock of Australia will soon be-
come those of the dogs in an aboriginal
camp.
Imbecile Paternalism.
If a matter of a halfpenny per pound stood
between the cane-sugar industry and destruc-
tion there are so-called Australians who
wouldn’t pay it. Vast is the ignorance of
such people and poor their imagination. The
actual value of the industry can be gauged
by the production of cane (2,439,000 tons in
1921-22) and the output of the refineries
(£11,000,000 p.a., imported raw material in-
cluded) ; but the potential value of the by-
products to a country liable to be cut off in
time of war is incalculably great. Few people
know that high explosives were manufactured
at, Brisbane from Queensland molasses dur-
ing the late quarrel with Germany. Southern
politicians visiting the Sugar State in pur-
suit of votes have returned with the news
that they chased the article in motor-cars
driven by power-alcohol, also extracted from
molasses, but no one paid much attention.
Yet a country without known supplies of
mineral oil in the free state ought to take
a lively interest in the production of power-
alcohol. Apropos, a newspaper extract: —
A company in the : sugar-cane business is produc-
ing 800 gallons of alcohol daily from -molasses-
which was formerly thrown away. The alcohol is
used .for fuel in operating tractors and motor-cars
on the big plantation. The process was invented
by the company’s superintendent.
But that is happening in Hawaii, not in
Queensland. The position in Queensland
was explained in the Senate recently by H.
S. Fold, who has been pegging away at the
subject for a year or more: —
After each crushing season, the Bundaberg Distil-
lery Co. produces immense quantities of rum, but
there is" only a limited demand for that liquor and
it is impossible to find a market for the present
output. Having millions of gallons of molasses
available, the co. is anxious to manufacture power-
alcohol. It has approached the Customs Department
times out of number for approval of a formula for
the denaturing of the spirit. The formula in ques-
tion has been endorsed by independent experts, but
the Department has vetoed it, declaring that if the
spirit were denatured in the manner proposed, people
might drink it. Experiments carried out by the Colonial
Sugar Refining Co. in Sydney, and by the Milla-
quin Refinery Co. in Bundaberg, have demonstrated
that power-alcohol as a motor spirit is equal, if not
superior to petrol. But because the Customs Depart-
ment is afraid that power-alcohol might become a
beverage a valuable by-product, capable of being
converted into a material which Australia urgently
needs, is going to waste. ...
According to the Commonwealth Statistician,
from six to eight million gallons of molasses
are produced in the Queensland mills, and,
roughly half of it is burnt or otherwise got
rid of. ’ And he adds that “large quantities
run to waste of which no record is kept.
Only Australia would tolerate such a destruc-
tion of wealth. Only in Australia would a
notentiallv first-class industry be strangled
In the birth to save a few born fools from
the hazard of a new folly.
■
Buying Unemployment.
The bulk of imports and exports is the
measure of a nation’s prosperity, according
to the old tvpe of Foreign-trader, an imported
creature who once flourished greatly in these
parts, and is said to still linger in outlying
mental localities. The idea arose in Britain
when that country’s supremacy at sea was
even more tremendous than it is now.
Britain owned the ships, and collected mil-
lions for carrying its own and other people s
goods, and it counted the income and said it
W as fine. Australia, instead of being paid
for the use of its ships, paid through the nose
for the use of other people’s ships, so the dif-
ference was much the same as that between
owning a distillery and drinking oneself into
a pauper’s tomb. But as goods were still
being dragged to and fro, the local Foreign-
trader counted the losses and said the situa-
tion was dashed superfine. Britain culti-
vated the Manchester school of ideas in the
hope of selling its manufactured goods at
great profit to itself, and getting raw
materials cheap. Being in a state of hope-
less mental confusion, Australia dabbled in
the same ideas; but it bought manufactured
goods at great profit to the other fellow, and
sold raw materials for very little. Owing to
an insufficient tariff, the loan habit,
too much devotion to the raw-material
craze, and a casual and two-up habit
of mind, Australia put up a great
buying -record for the year 1922-23 —in
fact, the second-best buying record in its his-
tory, the total being £131,808,000. As the
exports didn’t nearly pay for these, and pro-
vided nothing at all towards the interest on
old liabilities, it is roughly reckoned that this
country went more than £30,000,000 further
into debt. In other words, by giving work
out instead of doing it at home the country
bought 30 millions’ worth of unemployment,
which unemployment is in evidence, demon-
strating outside Parliament House, preaching
revolution on soap-boxes, haunting every
charity, peddling trifles at every door, and
clamoring for the building of an unpayable
railway to every town on the map. And by
all this fluff and indulgence instead
of struggling along within its means, Aus-
tralia also piled up 30 millions of new bur-
dens for the children, who will have their
own unemployment to look after. But the
trade total was splendid—much more splen-
did than if the country had only bought what
it could pay for —and calculated to gladden
any old hardshell Foreign-trader’s heart.
Divorce and Certain Churchmen.
F. S. Boyce, speaking on the Address-in-
Reply in N. S. Wales Leg. Council, “hoped
that the proposed bill relating to matrimonial
causes would provide for the repeal of the
‘restitution of conjugal rights’ provision
which made divorce possible by mutual con-
sent.” This sentiment, from one who _ is
at once a churchman and a barrister with
a lucrative divorce practice, illustrates a com-
mon point of view—that mainly of the section
which wants to see divorce a privilege re-
served for the rich. For good or evil, marri-
age and divorce are no longer in the hands
of the Church. Yet the Church continues
the struggle for what it was required to fore-
go in the middle of last century. Its policy
may be stated this way;—
1. The Church denies the spiritual validity of a
State (though not a Church) divorce.
2. It is opposed to any legal changes calculated to
make State divorces easier.
The second convention is reasonable in a
Church synod which regards marriage as a
sacrament, but utterly irrational in a State
legislature which treats marriage as a con-
tract. The law says that once a man has
promised marriage to a woman he may be
made liable in heavy damages if he breaks
the contract; and once married be may be
gaoled if he omits to support her.. He has
an obvious right, on his side, to expect her
to perform her share of the bargain —to be
a wife to him in every sense of the word.
And the husband has domestic and social
obligations, in addition to the duty of main-
taining his wife and family, which must be
fulfilled if married life is not to become in-
tolerable. Every man of the world knows
that there are thousands of cases in which,
though no act of physical misconduct may
have taken place, the husband (or wife)
has voided the matrimonial contract as com-
pletely as though there had been adultery
or cruelty. Where unconquerable antipathy
appears the only practicable solution is
divorce, however technically moral the party
responsible may be. There are other thou-
sands of cases in which one party to a marri-
age knows of the other’s misconduct, but
is unable to legally prove it. The guilty
one may be willing to see the end of a tie
which has become a mockery, but will not
agree to a divorce at the price of a scandal.
The restitution-order system serves to cope
with these and many other like problems.
Its one weakness is the hypocritical pretence,
made necessary by the existing state ot the
law, that the husband who writes to his
cocktail-drinking and adulterous wife, ask-
ing her to return to him and the children,
has any desire for her polluting presence
about his home. This provision should go,
not only with the object of shielding good
men and women from the crime ot perjury,
but also in order to save the faces of judges
and counsel who in the existing state of the
law are obliged to condone perjury. The
thing is all wrong, no doubt, from the stand-
point of churchmen, Anglican and ILL. T>ut
thev can vindicate their principles by refus-
ing personally to pander to what they regaid
as sin—as many, to their credit, do. Ihe
remarkable attitude of certain others is that
they object to divorce altogether in principle,
but are prepared to accept a certain amount
of it without complaint, provided thousands
who would be happier and more useful to
the State apart are left matrimonially en-
chained for the good of their souls.
The Yankeeflcation of Australia.
“A queer business” was Judge Moule’s dry
comment in Melbourne County Court on
the methods of the Associated Creditors
League of Australia. The bright idea which
is the basis of the Creditors’ League comes
from the U.S.A.—as nearly all these notions
do. A trader first gives credit, without due,
or any, regard to the financial status of the
customer, and then relies on the League t
enforce payment by bluff. Another hrm of
Yankee origin supplies bogus writs and .judg-
ment orders, documents which are sufficiently
like the real article to deceive 99 women out
a hundred —and women are, of course, the
principal objectives of these quasi-blackmail-
jno- devices. The American’s home is not his
castle in the great cities—an outcome of
the appearance of detective agencies which,
though privately owned, enjoy powerful poli-
tick support. They help the governing
authorities —Federal, State or mumcipal-
bv dealing with strikers, agitators and the
enemies, political and personal, of those in
power • and the politicians and municipal
bosses ’ reciprocate by allowing the agencies
to earn dividends in all sorts of extra-legal
ways. The bigger Australian cities have be-
gun to acquire the Pinkerton type of detec-
tive bureau; but, whereas the average town-
dwelling citizen of the TJ-.S. appears to rather
welcome regimentation by unauthorised per-
sons, the average Australian bitterly resents
it. A common trick employed by low-class
landlords in Sydney and Melbourne is to put
bailiffs into houses on printed documents
which have a superficially official aspect.
Once in the house the hireling collects the
landlord’s dues (p'lus “costs”), removes the
furniture, or drives forth the occupants,
according to instructions. Another growing
menace to law and order is represented by the
daring activities of our newly-acquired
agencies of illegality in divorce matters. A
good deal of their business consists in col-
lecting evidence of misconduct. Hardly a
week passes in the more crowded centres ot
population without newspaper reports, of
cases in which strange men have broken into
houses by night, and have explained their
burglarious intrusions on the ground .that
they believed adultery was being committed
on the premises. If the only danger con-
sisted in the probability of one of these
ruffians being shot, the community would
have little cause to worry. But American
experience has shown that it is in the pro-
motion of blackmail that their sort do most
damage. Leading Yankee agencies claim to
have sufficient evidence, hidden away in
their archives, to ruin thousands of promi-
nent citizens, and they no doubt have —inno-
cent citizens as well as guilty ones. Also, as
is inevitable, the “evidence” periodically
escapes from the archives with profitable re-
sults to those in possession of it. Not with-
out significance is the reported recrudescence
of the “push” in Australia —-half-a-dozen
serious assaults occur in Sydney alone in a
normal week-end. The Ku Klux Klan, whose
importation from the U.S.A. is being advo-
cated in at least three State capitals, is
only a “push” in nightgowns, and the Surry
Hills proletariat no doubt argue that if extra-
legal government enforced by horsewhips
and revolvers is right there cannot be much
wrong with the same form of government
enforced by sandbags and bottles. The lesson
of it all is that Australia would do well to
take a strong pull and a long pull on itself
before it is too late. At the present rate ot
progress there will be nothing British about
us inside a couple of decades.
The Press and the Gag.
During last Federal election campaign one
Francis Hilton Molesworth, described
as “of Artarmon (N.S.W.), public analyst,’
issued a writ against The Bulletin claim-
ing £2OOO damages for libel. The. case affords
an example of the way in which the law-
may be exploited. Moleswortii issued his
writ on September 25, and entered an ap-
pearance five days later. Declaration, pleas
and reply were filed on October 12, 18 anu
20 respectively. The next move—-the set-
ting of the case down for hearing—rested
with him. He had complained to the Court
that this paper’s remarks about him were
untrue and unjust and “calculated to dam
age him in his business.” Apparently-
inspired paragraphs were printed in
various papers to the effect that Moles-
worth had been grievously libelled, and
that he "intended to subpoena a number of
leading Nationalists” to prove it. Clearly,
if all this anguish was genuine, a man sen
sitive as to his honor and business reputa-
tion would not delay an unnecessary minute
in vindicating himself. What Moleswortii
did was to take advantage of a Supreme
Court rule which enables a plaintiff, it so
disposed, to delay setting his matter down
for hearing for tiie best part of six months.
A plaintiff who has no intention of proceeding
with a suit usually calls a halt at this stage,
for it is here that expensive barristers are
briefed. Molesworth, his “injured reputa-
tion” and his “leading Nationalist friends
duly faded out last March ; and the rest ot tne
time has been occupied by The Bulletin
in an effort to recover its costs, lhe sup-
posed effect of such a writ as Molesworth s
(known to the legal profession as a stop
writ”) is to debar the defendant news-
paper from saying anything more about the
plaintiff while the suit is pending. Mean-
while, however, a plaintiff is not precluded
from stigmatising as a libeller a journal, like
The Bulletin, which takes pride _ m tne
fact that it does not traffic in libels; and
he may go on doing it in the daily press so
long as the allegations have any value to
him. No reasonable newspaper asks, for the
right to prejudice a fair trial. But it ougut
to be incumbent on the plaintiff to set the
case down for trial immediately issues are
joined, and let it take its place on the list.
Under the law, as it stands, political and
other adventurers are encouraged to indulge
in the gamble of setting the libel law in
motion on the off-chance of a settlement,
knowing that, even if the worst should be-
fall and no dividend materialise, the de-
fendant’s mouth will most likely be shut tor
at least six months.
The Kidman Blight.
Dear Bulletin, —I well know the district
said to be affected by the Kidman Blight: 1
have “worked” sheep there; I saw the
rabbit-invasion of 1888 and the shifting san
hills cover up two widths of rabbit-netting,
and I saw Lord Carrington shovel mud in
the ’9O flood. Now, if there is a blight there
is surely a cure; but before finding the cure
we must get at the cause. Sid Kidman only
did what others would have done had they
known and been as flush. When cattle
almost had a standard value lie acquired
about 20.000,000 acres in the Western Dis-
trict of N S. Wales; but before he opened
fire on the latter State he laid hold of very-
large areas in Queensland and South Aus-
tralia. When both of these States had
enough of him he commenced operations in
N S Wales, making a start at W anaarmg,
and extended his holding by embracing Tina-
pagee, Elsinora, Urismo, Thurloo Downs,
Salisbury, Bootra, Yancannia, Momba, Isick-
saddle, Connulpie, Yantara, Yandama, Wein-
teriga, Corona, etc. These places are linked
up in a friendly way with South Aus. and
Queensland, so that Sid Kidman can place
a foot in each State and keep his eyes on the
other simultaneously. The Law bas allovved
nil this The story could really end theie.

9th inst., to gladly sell all his interests in
Queensland and N. S. Wales,, especially to
those who have so much to say of blight
conditions. Firstly, the cause of the alleged
blight in N. S. Wales is the Western Lands
Act, which was to relieve individual holders,
who at the time, were down and out and
left with short tenures. The Act created a
monopoly, and now it is characterised as
blight, and it looks like that, too. Other
States learned their lesson, and took neces-
sary steps. Westralia smelt a taint, and
safeguarded itself against an invasion, pass-
ing a short Act in 1920. By using the
words “owned or financially interested” it
made that State immune to this blight. No
sane mind would think that any one man
or company could satisfactorily maintain
such a scope of country as Sid Kidman
holds. People, no doubt, differ in their views
and ideas of monopoly: some argue because
Anthony Horderns’ front three streets they
must be a monopoly, forgetting how the area
within the enclosure is intensively used. The
difference between the Horderns and Sid
Kidmian needs no argument. Only last week
Queensland gazetted that it had resumed
some 750,000 acres for closer settlement m
blocks of 10,000 acres. This certainly seems
strange for a country with about 600,000
square miles and a population of only (say)
700,000. Has the blight affected Queensland
so seriously that it is compelled to resume
to meet the demand for land? Any Govern-
ment which opens the gates to admit mon-
opoly should lead it back through the same
opening, and with the same honest intention
a? it had when the mistake was made. See-
ing that Sid Kidman has stated his willing-
ness to sell out, in both Queensland and
N. S. Wales, let the Governments get in
touch with him, subdivide the holdings in
designed classified areas, ‘surveys to follow
application. Let Sid Kidman remain the
landlord, and the respective Land Boards a
Board of Control. Select young fellows who
have had experience in the Backblocks. Such
subdivisions could start nearest the railway
and extend as was found necessary without
hindering the convenient working of the
balance. The vast area would soon all be
taken up, with a hundred working where
there is only one to-day.—Yours, J. W. D.
The Bight Sort of Second Chamber.
“Clifford Snook” : Now that the figures are
out it appears that the Queensland Govern-
ment secured 14 more seats than the Oppo-
sition, with 14,000 less votes. The Opposition
registered 198,931 supporters and the Gov-
ernment had 184,562, including corpses and
ghosts. The census revealed that there were,
in Theodore’s State, 423,128 persons aged
over 21, including prisoners, lunatics, inva-
lids and the very aged. To bring 90 per cent,
of this scattered army to the poll seems im-
possible, and ghosts are strongly suspected.
The redistribution of seats was a marvel of
ingenuity. The essence of redistribution is
to be generous with districts which are cer-
tainties for the Opposition, and adjust elec-
toral boundaries so that the Opposition fel-
low may win by 5000 votes, which is doing
the thing handsomely, and is also 4999 good
votes wasted. In the meantime the Govern-
ment is modestly contented if it wins 10
seats with a majority of 100 each. The Oppo-
sition has 4000 more votes, and the Government
has nine more seats, and all being a matter
of strict legality what is there to complain
of? Some legal dryasdusts maintain that
there is no wrong for which the law, “that
true embodiment of everything that’s excel-
lent,” doesn’t provide a remedy, but the legal
remedy for the seizure and retention of
power by gerrymandering has never been dis-
closed. The election shows that a Second
Chamber is a necessary part of the appara-
tus of popular freedom—provided it is the
right kind of Chamber. It should represent
the State as one constituency—a constitu-
ency which may be haunted by ghosts and
faked in many ways, but which can’t be
gerrymandered. The elections for the Federal
House of Reps, and Senate, which are not
managed by the Theodore Government, tes-
tify every time that Queensland has no
earthly use for Theodore and co. Its own
Upper House would say the same if it was an
elective body on the basis suggested. And as
a representative Upper House would have
power to block the legislation of a very non-
representative Lower one, it would be a body
to be taken seriously. It was only when
the Labor party became degenerate that it
put the abolition of the Senate on its pro-
gramme. The ideal of the rottenest kind of
new Laborism is a House of Reps, standing
alone, and with Communism so buttressed by
spook voters and gerrymandered electoral
boundaries that its term of office could be
ended by no legal devices whatever. The
boundaries of the Senate constituencies be-
ing fixed and immutable, it would be a solid
barrier against the worst forms of political
fraud, also a solid nuisance to the worst kind
of political sharks. In other words, it would
be a palladium of liberty—the thing above
all others that no Red Objective sort of per-
son desires to see about the premises.
The Hun paper-mark may be said to have
collapsed utterly, a square mile of currency
being worth about a silver shilling. But
the Allied Powers have got over the scare
that with the collapse a great stifling blanket
of fantods would fall over civilisation, and
the unknown and the improbable and the
impossible and the incomprehensible would
all happen at once. In fact, they are taking
little notice. The smash was brought about
very simply. The Government made little
effort to collect revenue, though revenue, in
the shape of old marks, was almost blowing
about the streets. Instead, it printed new
marks by the billion to cover Government
expenses, till their value was almost a minus
quantity. Its plea was that this flimsy Crea-
tion of scorn, which no one wanted, was
all it had to pay an indemnity with. In-
stead of paying it suggested that the Allies
should lend it a heap of gold, so that it might
restore its factories, which had no damage
done to them, and set industry going again,
BLAMING IT ON TO BILL.
“The losses on the war-service homes to June 30, 1922, were estimated at £1,628,8[?]6, plus the admin-
istrative expenditure (£541,448) and the economic loss caused by the shutting down of timber-mills
acquired by the Government.”— Stewart, Commonwealth Works Minister,
THE BOY: “But what’s this?”
LHE MINISTER: “ Merely your share of the loss we made on the beautiful home we pro-
mised Bill. There’ll be other accounts, of course; but think what Bill did for us!”
though industry looks pretty fit at present.
But it is difficult to make a convincing
national bankruptcy, in view of the fact that
last year Germany was the second greatest
shipbuilder in existence, its output of ton-
nage being not very far behind that of
Britain, and almost equal to that of France,
Holland and the U.S.A. put together.
Further, the Hun still owns per
cent, of Europe’s known coal deposits,
while France owns 2k per cent.; where-
fore the latter was naturally annoyed
when the coal supply, which was part of
the indemnity, ceased, and the fuel was sold
abroad for hard cash instead. The amount
of German capital accumulating at com-
pound interest abroad, out of reach of the
indemnity-collectors, has become far too
large to be disguised, and though it may
stand in the name of Herr Schmidt, the im-
pression is unavoidable that a great part of
Herr Schmidt is really the “insolvent” Gov-
ernment.
Dear Bulletin, — I would like to be a
skeleton at the feast, or something of the
sort, in the matter of this unanimous verdict
about worked-to-death U.S. Presidents. The
cry is so unanimous that it must be wrong.
No doubt a person of sufficient rustle and
hustle could work himself to death in soli-
tary confinement, but it i.rn’t essential that
he should do so. The Pres-dent’s powers are
certainly great, but they are not nearly so
great as those of an old-time Caesar, and
there were Caesars who had so much leisure
for over-eating that they did little else —
save over-drmking. His responsibilities are
also great, but not nearly so great as those
of a Czar, or Kaiser (German or Austrian
variety) or a Sultan in quite recent days,
inach of them was up against the spectre of
invasion, from which a U.S. President is
more free than any other ruler I can think
of. And each was haunted by the fear that
some false step might lose the throne for his
son or grandson. The legend of Atlas tot-
tering under the burden of the globe is now,
I suppose, in its second Presidential genera-
tion. Yet Woodrow Wilson may really
have found time hanging heavily on his
hanus, seeing that he went to Europe to take
a personal share in the Peace Conference,
while other monarchs were content to appear
by deputy. He afterwards wore himself out
on a tremendous speech-making campaign
in the interests of his pet scheme of a League
of Nations, but none of these activities was
part of his regular round of duty. He found
time to issue at least one book during his
term of otnce. His successor lived in quieter
times; also, for that matter, in quieter times
than Lincoln or Johnson. But he was a
sick man w 7 hen he took office. He died of
much the same complication that killed
John Storey. And John, who spent most
of his brief N.S.W. Premiership on holiday,
and was no strenuous toiler after his first
week of office, didn’t come to his end through
overwork. Apparently a speech-making tour
was the last straw in Harding’s case also.
Possibly the theory that every Limited Stater
is a day-and-night worker is more a theory
than anything else. —Yours, etc., Solomon
IVIALAPROP.
“Dominie” : N. S. Wales Ministers of Edu-
cation have for years bewailed the shortage
of funds for repairing and renovating school
buildings. If the Department’s methods were
pursued by any private business firm, it
would not only be short; it would
be bankrupt. Some time ago a fore-
man of works visited our school, took mea-
surements, had a look round and departed.
Eighteen months afterwards the even tenor
of our way was disturbed by an invasion of
two painters and one carpenter. There was
no material on the job for the men to go
on with, but, fortunately, the painters had
brought a little white-lead with them from
another job just completed. The carpenter
did a few days’ work pulling up old flooring,
etc.; then he had to wait three days (being
paid all the time) till his timber arrived.
The painters ran out of paint, and had to
arrange with the foreman of a school job
in a neighboring town for supplies. Mean-
time, the carpenter discovered that in the
18 months that had passed since the fore-
man’s visit some of the main bearers under
the school and residence had been eaten by
white ants. Thereupon began a burning of
telegraph-wires for authority to replace the
ant-eaten bearers. After- much delay (the
carpenter being paid all the time) the work
was sanctioned. Followed negotiations for
timber. After three weeks’ delay (the car-
penter idle but paid all the time) the timber
arrived, and the job was completed. The
carpenter’s work should not have exceeded
three weeks at the outside; it took eight
weeks, the other five being wasted through
ridiculous and unnecessary hold-ups. All this
could be overcome if a competent foreman,
in charge of the works of various schools in
a district, was instructed to go around, in-
spect the buildings, decide on the repairs
necessary, and have the material put on to
the jobs so that the repairing gangs could
go straight on with the work. But this
simple remedy would smack too much of
ordinary commohsense for a department
obsessed with red tape and eager not to
reduce work but to make it.
“Belama” : “Albatross’s” picture of the
Solomons (B. 9/8/’23) is a caricature
rather than a portrait. The young man
who goes to the islands and finds him-
self with from £l2 to £l7 on hand each
month after paying living expenses, appa-
rently becomes a “slave” and drunkard, be-
cause drink is the only pastime within reach.
In the picture it is charged against the
bosses that they sell goods to their employees
at a substantial reduction on regular prices.
This is a complaint that most people in the
islands and elsewhere would gladly see be-
come more prevalent. The allegation that
employers, by making this concession, en-
courage their men to drink and run into debt
is far-fetched indeed. The island employer,
like the employer elsewhere, is chiefly con-
cerned to obtain a sober, reliable assistant,
and when, as too often happens in the
islands, the young man turns out to be a
disgruntled, drunken slacker, his patronage
of the booze department (when there is one)
does not save him from being well and truly
fired. Why cannot the self-styled “white-
slave” be honest, look facts in the face and
frankly own up to it that the fault lies
with himself, and not with the copra boss
or big firms? After all, it is mostly a mat-
ter of temperament, and it is notorious that
not one-tenth of the young men who go to
the Pacific Islands are temperamentally
fitted to stand the lonely, monotonous life
there; and this fact is responsible for much
of the discontent and “white-slave” vapor-
ings that find expression in print. For those
who can withstand a somewhat treacherous
climate, and whose temperament is in har-
mony with the conditions of a solitary exist-
ence among the crocodiles and cocoanuts,
there is much in the free, unconventional
island life that appeals and fascinates. Those
who cannot find recreation and interest in
the virgin jungle and coral reefs, in the
wide sphere of literature or in useful handi-
crafts, should not go to the islands or other
lonely spots of the earth. They are not of
the stuff of which pioneers are made; and
it will be best for all concerned if they re-
main where their mild craving for adven-
ture can be satisfied from the comfortable
seats of a movie-palace.
•
“Ex-Dig.” : By consenting at last to take
charge of all ex-soldiers who are suffering
from mental derangement the Commonwealth
is only fulfilling an obligation which should
have been shouldered sooner. Hitherto a
section of such sufferers has been ignored,
i.e., those whose mental condition was con-
sidered as “not due to war service.” The
only excuse to be found for Repat’s attitude
is that some of the unbalanced ex-Diggers
never heard a shot fired. Towards men
who did see fighting the attitude of uncon-
cern was utterly indefensible. One man
whom Repat. refused to regard as its respon-
sibility had four years’ service at the Front,
and another 603 days. They were discharged
as sound, and later developed insanity. In
one instance it is true that excessive drink-
ing was assigned as the direct cause; but
how is the Commonwealth'to say how much
or how little the war was responsible? It sowed
the seeds of insanity in many men, and exces-
sive trouble on their return —in some in-
stances to find their whole family life dis-
rupted—did the rest. It is well that this
responsibility is recognised, but some
gross injustices still remain to be recti-
fied. The widows of several soldiers who have
suicided since their return have been denied
the benefits to which they would be entitled
as war-widows, because officialdom refuses
to recognise their husband’s deaths as “due
to war service.” This is an easy assertion
to make, but those who realise what war is
know that it is more likely to be wrong than
right.

POLITICAL
POINT
From a late storm-centre :
Recourse to the “gag” invariably , provokes ■»>pri-
sals, and so it was in the R,epis. last week. The
outstanding feature of the uproar was a shrill burst
of passion on the part of Charlton, who is ordinarily
a model of decorum. He had this justification, that
the Government was rushing through ill-considered,
if not ill-drafted, legislation; moreover, his party
was endeavoring to make useful suggestions; whilst
Bruce's crowd mostly rested in the party-room, and
only turned out to vote when a division was called
for. So angry was , Charlton that he refused to
attend a complimentary dinner to the departing
P.M.; and Blakeley and McGrath were suspended for
breaches of the rules. In Blakeley’s case one can
only offer the comment that he deserved all that
came to him. The defeat of the Government on a
snatch division at midnight on Thursday was equally
well merited, for its tactics were frankly provocative.
The Laborites didn’t enjoy their triumph long. They
were so paralysed that not one of them had the wit
to take advantage of the situation. For a few
minutes they had the power to vote the Speaker out
of the Chair for any period they desired. Had they
ordered Watt to leave for a month, or even a week,
the Government would have been compelled to take
emergency measures to get the House together again.
And all the trouble originated in Bruce’s determina-
tion to restrict Parliament to a ten-weeks’ session,
even if legislation was scamped in the process—as it
has been. It will be unsafe for him, or any other
Priminister, to repeat the offence.
Touching the trouble in Tasmania: —
It started when the anti-Labor caucus met and
pointedly asked the Hayes Government what it pro-
posed to do about the unflattering report presented
by the Railways Commission. Then Speaker Evans
and half-a-dozen other Ministerialists held a meeting
and decided that J. C. Newton should be given the
job of reconstructing the Cabinet. Naturally Hayes
was angry, and his chance of glutting his ire came
when Newton, having been elected leader, informed
the party that he had not succeeded in assembling a
team, and asked Hayes, to continue. Hayes morosely
declined. The situation was then critical, for Hayes
had an urgent appointment at Government House.
Suddenly the Premier reared his six or seven feet of
commanding personality aloft and shouted for atten-
tion. Pointing a huge forefinger at his nearest neigh-
bor, he demanded: “Will you support Lee?” Receiv-
ing an affirmative reply, he shifted the big forefinger
a point or two and stabbed another Nationalist in
the lower chest with the fateful question. And so
on with the lot. Only one of the mob said “No.”
Inside 15 minutes Hayes had resigned, and Lee had
the Administrator’s commission to form a Ministry.
At 7.30 the same evening the new Premier met Par-
liament with Newton as Chief Secretary and Minister
of Mines and Forests; Hean as Minister of Education
and Attorney-General; Hobbs in Lands and Works, and
Pitt, M.L.C., as honorary. Followed a stormy debate,
to the great joy of crowded galleries, and Lee event-
ually carried his motion for a month’s adjournment,
on the casting vote of the Speaker. One (somewhat
doubtful) Government supporter was out of the State,
one (Murdoch) classed the floor, and Jensen (Ind.)
also voted with the Labor 12, making 14 aside.
.When a Government meets with a salute such as this
on its first appearance it is likely to develop jumps.
And a Government with the jumps may commit sui-
cide at any time.
When the N. S. Wales Fuller Government
took office last year the Assembly was com-
posed of 42 Fullerites, including Speaker
Levy, nine Progressives, mostly inclined to
Fuller, 37 Laborites and two pro-Labor inde-
pendents. One of the Laborites (Gosling) is
away in England. Three others—Gregory
McGirr, Bailey and Minalian —are no longer
admitted to caucus. A fifth is believed to be
struggling with conscientious doubts. For
these and other reasons Fuller’s defeat on
Lang’s no-confidence amendment looked im-
probable early in the week, even if the Pro-
gressives affirmed by their votes that “decep-
tion” had been practised by the Government
regarding the payment of £549,214 to the
Australian Wheat Board. Nobody wants
an election, anyhow, and a wheat-pool
wrangle, incomprehensible to 99 p.c. of the
people, is not an issue on which an election
should be fought.
Westralia is growing dubious about
Premier Mitchell’s group settlements. Mon-
ger, the Cockies’ president, charges Mitchell
with having left development costs and
markets out of his calculations. Perth
Call asserts that many settlers have thrown
up the sponge; that others will fade out
as soon as “sustenance” gives out; that the
Government drains have a vexatious habit
of falling in, and that at least one was
excavated with the idea that water would
ANYTHING BUT THE WHOLE HOG.
“Premier Lawson has refused to sacrifice his Cabinet to please the metropolitan Liberals in his party.
Negotiations are still proceeding.”
THE METROPOLITAN LIBERAL: “ Fancy trying to kill it with a pair of scissors !”
LAWSON: “But Em not trying to kill it — I’m merely endeavoring to make you a nice
silk purse out of its ear.”
run uphill. Yet the Call is pro-Mitchell:
in fact, one of its proprietors resigned from
the Labor party a few months ago and
stood- as a Mitchell candidate.
With tears in his voice Vic. Premier Law-
son implored the Liberals who follow him,
more or less willingly, to be a united body,
but he declined to sacrifice any of his col-
leagues to make room for the office-hungry.
The appeal' was effective till the rising of the
caucus. Then it flashed across the minds of
most of the rank and file that Lawson had
been a champion reconstructor in his time,
having bowed out Bowser, trudged to Canossa
to bring in Peacock (left in the snow 2J
years previously), retired Pennington to
make room for Livingston, reinstated Pen-
nington when Livingston had tired of the
job, and promoted new men when the coun-
try had dropped Mackinnon and Hutchinson.
These and other changes were moodily re-
called at a meeting of Liberals without the
Ministry. That body has now only a weekly
tenancy of the Treasury benches, but it isn’t
necessarily entitled to a week’s notice to quit.
A vexatious dispute has arisen among Fed-
eral members as to where they should recruit
their shattered energies after their year’s
“work” —it began on June 13 and finishes be-
fore the end of the month. Some of the Queens-
landers and South Australians got in early
and arranged for the 331st picnic to the
Northern Territory. But it is a long way
between pubs in the Territory, and another
faction declared for a trip to London and
the Empire Exhibition. The Exhibitioners
were gathering strength when the effusive
Mahony, who has been hobnobbing with the
Japanese science delegates, suddenly sug-
gested a jaunt to Japan, “with a view,” he
unblushingly alleged, “of counteracting the
unfavorable impression caused by articles in
the newspapers and establishing friendly rela-
tions between Japan and Australia.”
Mahony’s idea was taken up enthusiastically
by the younger set, who have never seen a
mousme or a geisha, but the Exhibitioners
are still numerous, and the Territorians
gloomily insist that a promise is a promise.
There is a possibility of the argument being-
referred to a Judge, or (should the entire
judiciary be serving on royal commissions) to
the League of Nations, which has a special
department for spongers and sturdy beggars.
In the University Management Reform
Bill, launched in Vic. Assembly, no pro-
vision is made for the appointment of a prin-
cipal to discharge duties now performed after
a fashion by a chancellor, and to co-ordinate
the work of all sections of the ’Varsity. This
is regarded by Eggleston, M.L.A. for St.
Ivilda, as the great defect of the measure,
and other graduates agree with him that the
ship has been spoiled for the sake of a
ha’porth of tar. It mightn’t be easy to find
the ideal administrator, but before the bill
gets through both Houses it may contain a
provision for the employment of as good a
man as can be got for the available money.
Tas. Speaker Jacky Evans has no respect for
the ancient tradition that the presiding offi-
cer of a legislature is non-partisan. Faced
with the necessity of giving a casting vote
to save the newest Lee Government on its
first test motion, the jovial ex-mariner ex-
plained at length that “in this Parliament
the Speaker simply has to be a party-man,
and cast his vote in accordance with party
discipline. I, therefore, vote with the ayes.”
A more diplomatic Speaker would have cut
out the explanation and the untactful “there-
fore.” Neither was necessary. A Speaker
is not bound to give reasons for his vote.
The obvious effect of Jacky’s long-winded
confession was to suggest that his Govern-
ment’s motion would not have passed on
its merits.
South Aus. is annoyed at the story told by
Yates in the House of Reps, that money
advanced to farmers in that State for drought
relief and seed wheat has not been repaid in
the recent good seasons. Laffer, Minister for
.Lands, called it, in the polite S. Australian
way, “a serious and untrue reflection upon
the farming community.” The total advanced
for drought relief was, he said, £750,000, and
93 per cent, of it has been repaid. Which
shows how lucky, or something, S. Australia
is.
In addition to expelling Bailey, Bramston
and the rest over the ballot-box business
Sydney A.L.P. executive “censured” P. E.
Coleman, M.H.R. for Reid. Coleman was
secretary of the Clerical Association when
it borrowed a ballot-box from the A.L.P.
and found it had a sliding panel. Coleman
did not report his discovery for some time,
and it was for the delay that he was repri-
manded. But had he reported promptly he
would only have done himself an injury. As
things were in the A.L.P. hanky-panky had
to be met with hanky-panky. Before he won
the Reid selection, Coleman had to get the
police records of certain toughs who, he knew,
were to be “rung in” as local unionists.
Armed with these dossiers, he frustrated their
knavish tricks.
Australia is such a casual country that
no particular surprise is expressed when
Ministers mislay their own departments, or
parts of them. Bowden, a diligent member
of the Bruce-Page Cabinet, recently touched
upon the necessity of having a hydrographic
and survey branch of the Australian Navy.
There happens to be one, and ILM.A.S.
Geranium is doing its work. Still, the Min-
ister who is supposed to control the Navy
couldn’t be expected to know that. A few
years ago one of his predecessors appointed
a bandmaster to the Brisbane. It was only
when the captain wanted to know what the
Hades he was to do with a bandmaster that
the Minister learnt that fourth-class cruisers
don’t run to such frills. The man whose
job slipped away from him in this way
claimed compensation and got it.
The Melbourne dailies will be able to gee
through the silly season without any notable
drop in circulation. Bruce has provided a
first-rate copy-producing Royal Commission
on the Commonwealth’s huge sugar . pur-
chases from Java, and Lawson has appeased
Deany and other outport Assemblymen by
giving them two tribunals —one to probe an
alleged bribery-and-corruption scandal Con-
nected with the Warrnambool breakwater,
the other to report on harbor development
outside Melbourne.
One of the items in Earle Page’s Budget
is an amount of £990, a belated bill from
Pearce’s Washington trip, which last year
had cost £Bl4B. Whether further dockets
for overlooked cigars and dinners will con-
tinue to trickle in and blush for their pub-
licity in the next balance-sheet only Pearce
and the Cabinet know ; but it is plain that
Hughes’s old offsider has a capacity for ex-
pensive jaunting only paralleled by Hughes
himself. Pearce’s recent run to the Northern
Territory has already lifted £387 out of th
cashbox, and seeing that the bill was presented
just before the 1922-23 accounts closed the
likelihood of other charges cropping up for
the useless adventure is not remote. Inci-
dentally, Vic. Premier Lawson’s seven
months’ trip to London and back with his
wife and his secretary—he returned by way
of America—-cost a trifle over £2OOO.
Queensland’s soldier-settlements at Beer-
burrum and Coominya are in the street
called Queer. Of 80 original settlers at
Coominya, only about 30 remain, and they
are undergoing the familiar process of being
“transferred to other districts.” They were
invited to grow grapes and citrus fruits, and
at a cost of £70,000 it has been discovered
that Coominya isn’t suitable for such experi-
ments. The trouble at Beerburrum, which is a
pineapple plantation, is that 40,000 cases of
pineapples have been produced this year, and
that the State cannery will take only 15,000
owing to the market being glutted. At first
2s. 6d. a case was offered, but as a special
favor another Is. per case is to be paid for
the winter crop. Even at this rate the
settlers can hang on only by feeding on
pineapples three times a day, and clothing
themselves in the skins. Thousands of their
fellow-Diggers in other parts of the conti-
nent are as badly off, or worse. And not
a single politician has been hanged.

The WILD CAT

The outstanding investment at present on
the market throughout the Commonwealth
is the. Federal 5 p.c. loan, 1928. Its merits
as an investment are: (1) The excellent
security—none better is offering; (2) the
interest return —privileges and concessions
lift the nominal rate of 5 p.c. to £.5 9s.
3d. p.c. for each of the five years; (3) the
facilities available on stock exchanges for
readily converting into cash at any time if
the holder desires. Besides these aspects of
the issue, there is the obligation on the part
of every citizen to make portion of his spare
cash available for the Treasurer so that
war-time obligations can be met. This loan
renews one which produced the funds to
finance the A.I.F. to victory, and was raised
on the solemn undertaking of the Common-
wealth Government that subscribers would
receive 20s. in the £ on September 15 next.
Though, whatever happens, the Treasurer
will be in a position to pay in full by arrang-
ing for temporary accommodation —evidently
with the banks —failure to renew will simply
postpone the day of reckoning. Ample funds
are available to give many times over the
balance of 15 millions still not covered, and
ruling conditions do not warrant the Trea-
surer offering terms more attractive than
those now provided—except, perhaps, that
arrangements might be made with the banks
to permit payment by instalments as _on
former occasions. Failing full subscription,
Treasurer Earle Page will be. forced to con-
sider two distasteful alternatives: a capital
levy or stiffer taxation to insure against
the consequences of default in future re-
newals.

Paid capital has remained stationary at
£1.478,010 for 23 years; there are 41,676
£lo-paid prefs. and 212,250 £lO ordinaries
paid to £5. The prefs. are the one-fifth ot
pre-bust deposits which were converted into
scrip ; they are entitled to 5 p.c. non-cumuia-
tive, but share point for point with ordina-
ries in any distribution in excess of that
rate received by the latter. They also rank
for priority of return of capital; but that
right ceases “if and so soon as the co. shall
have paid 10 half-yearly divs. at the rate ot
at least 7 p.c. p.a., and also if and when the
ordinary shares shall be fully paid up. ihe
introductory table shows that the co. has
now fulfilled the first of these stipulations, and
should the ordinaries be fully called the prefs.
would apparently differ from the ordinaries
only to the extent of having first call
on divs. up to 5 p.c. in any one year.
Just at present no new capital is required,
because for every £1 of funds (capital and
reserves) onlv £5 10s. of the public s money
is held, and that proportion can be expanded
to £8 under accepted standards, though De-
fore that figure was reached the management
would probably find that it could profitably
employ more funds. Just prior to the war
only £4 of outside money was held for every
£1 of funds, and the improvement in the
ratios, together with better interest and ex-
change returns, explains how div. rates have
been'lifted 50 p.c. in nine years. In doing
so the directors have paid away a greater
proportion of earnings than any other bank
has done; still, some hungry scrip-holders
are not satisfied and want the rate lifted to
10 p.c. If strength and stability are to be
the first considerations, the directors must
shut their ears to these murmurings: on a
10 p.c. basis, the Bank of Victoria would
have had a lay-by for the past year of on y
4s. 9d. for every £1 distributed. And only
time could prove whether some of that 4s.
Ud. was not fictitious.
The following table shows how the net
profits of the introductory table were arrived
at: —

*Less provision for doubtful debts.
The see-saw behavior of disclosed gross pro-
fits indicates that the management took credit
for more of the earnings of the abnormal
exchange period than did most banks. An-
other feature of the table is that for the past
two years, though there was considerable
outlay on new branches, there has been no
visible reduction of that account out of cur-
rent earnings. On the other hand, a good
deal may have been shoved aside on the quiet,
though there is no evidence of that beyond
the statement that gross profits are shown
less provision for bad and doubtful accounts.
There are several reasons why the Bank of
Victoria is not doing quite so handsomely as
others. To begin with, it is comparatively
small and operates in a restricted field. Its
only Australian branch outside the Cabbage
Garden is in Adelaide. The directors re-
cently considered opening a branch in Syd-
ney, but banking there is regarded as “rather
overdone,” and the heavy cost of extension,
therefore, unwarranted. Some of the
vincial-minded also consider that the name
of the bank is sufficient to damn its chances
with the barbarians across the border. The
bank’s business has also been compara-
tively small in relation to funds, though
the position has greatly improved in recent
years. And, so far as ordinary shareholders
are concerned, their prospects are restricted
owing to the terms of the reconstruction
which followed the collapse in the ’nineties;
instead of having, as in the case of many
of its competitors, large volumes of cheap
pref. capital or interminable stock, all its
scrip ranks for the same rate of div. Inci-
dentally, the writing-down of capital was
not quite so severe as in some. cases. In
addition, visible reserves in relation to capi-
tal are small. But one way and another, the
Bank of Victoria, from its published
accounts, looks comfortable. This table shows
its expansion since 1914, and reveals its pre-
sent position: —

According to the Profit and Loss account the
net profit for the year was £25;386 ; but that
was the balance remaining after the direc-
tors had decided what provision should be
made for depreciation; actual net earnings
depend, in part, on whether that allowance
was more or less than adequate. There were
also additions to reserves during . the year
which were not credited to earnings: the
general reserve fund expanded £3OOO with-
out explanation, and reserves for taxation
and contingencies had £3BOO added. Assum-
ing the latter is not tapped for taxes in-
curred in the period under review, the 12
months produced £32,186 of profit, j>lus
any possible over-allowance for deprecia-
tion. But even that gives only part of the
year’s performances. The Manly Co. for
many years carried practically all its insur-
ance risks: its run of luck was so good that
by 1920 £140,000 of insurance investments
had piled up. Three years ago the co. was
reconstructed and a subsidiary was formed
to take over all insurance ri'ks. Its perform-
ances have been as follows: —

1923 . . 15,405 8448 360 6597 2,368
The £15,405 surplus for the past year, as in
the case of the parent co., is larger than the
amount claimed by the directors ; they wrote
£915 off goodwill and did not include it with
profits. Three years’ underwriting shows
Avhat a sweet thing the internal insurance
arrangement has been :
I nterest
Premiums. Losses. Expenses. Earnings.
1921.. £9,378 £7OB £6Ol £6,789
1922.. 8,873 801 3183 6,682
1923.. 9,348 223 2147 7,513
£27,599 £1732 £5931 £20,984^
Premiums and interest have given £48,583
and only £1732 has been taken by claims,
while management exes, and taxes have
absorbed £5931. Thus £5 of every £6 handled
has been surplus—not profit, because there
are formidable risks to which funds are
exposed.
Adding the insurance profits to ferry earn-
ings discloses that the co. continues to do
very well, though not quite so handsomely, as
it did between 1910-14. High working
costs, dear coal and stores and heavy taxa-
tion have cut into larger receipts. However,
comparisons are not of much value without in-
formation as to the lay-by for depreciation. It
is not at all unlikely that the directors deem
it advisable to make larger provision than
they used to do —that is, if earnings permit.
When the old business was split in two the
book value of steamers was written up and
multiplied by about three. The valuation by
Captain Spinks was made at the height of
the boom, and to-day’s replacement value
may be very different, notwithstanding that
local costs have not declined much—-the
latest addition, the Baragoola, cost around
£75,000 to put into commission. Even
though the co.’s rights and privileges look
secure —and, after all, it is the earning capa-
city of the very fine fleet that, counts most
—the directors would be ill-advised to main-
tain the book value of steamers at an in-
flated level. Replacement value, in this in-
stance, is not necessarily local construction
cost; that fact would be made apparent to
the directors if at some time an unfriendly
Government decided to resume the service.
The division of interests, the writing-up of
assets and the issue of bonus scrip have made
only a slight difference to shareholders’ divs.
Those who have continued to hold the two
lots of scrip now receive 16 p.c. p.a. instead
of the former 13J p.c. The early-birds—those
who acquired an interest 20 years ago, when
the future of the service was quite obscure
—have done wonderfully: there have been
so many issues of bonus scrip that their
cash-paid interest is only a wee bit of their
total holding. From the point of view of
the outside investor the ferry co. looks a
solid 6 p.c. proposition, with prospects of
better results as the Manly districts become
more populated, and provided running-costs
become no heavier. But a repetition of the
glittering performances of the past cannot
be expected.
The insurance and investment .co.’s paid
capital is made up of £140,808 in £l-paid
6 p.c. cum. prefs., with rights to share point
for point with ordinaries. So far the mini-
mum rate has been the maximum, and though
the parent’s long run of luck has stuck to
it, there are risks which the investor must
not overlook. By fire and workmen’s com-
pensation claims the co. is nut likely to be
severely hit, and under Navigation regula-
tions public risk is apparently, limited to
£l2 per ton, and the co. would presumably
not be caught for more than about £12,000
if two steamers collided and went down with
all hands. The biggest risk is in respect of
the possible total loss of steamers whose re-
placement may take up to £70,000 each. The
subsidiary is entirely at the mercy of the
parent co.; it is run by the same directorate
which, no doubt, may decide precisely how
much the insurance co. should receive from
the parent in the form of premiums. One
way and another, the P. J. Investment and
Insurance Co., notwithstanding its £149,000
of very healthy assets, cannot be regarded
even as a moderately “safe” insurance con-
cern—unless it re-insures some of its most
hazardous irsks, which, apparently, it does
not do.
The young Commonwealth General Assur-
ance is giving another demonstration of
sword-swallowing. Last year it practised on
the Industrial business of the Life Insurance
Co. of Aus., and paid a good price for it,
greatly to the delight of the L.C.A., which
had struggled unsuccessfully for 11 years to
make its operations in that branch self-sup-
porting. Now the C.G.A. is absorbing the
12-years’ Industrial harvest of the Co-opera-
tive Assurance (Sydney). The last actuarial
investigation necessitated the writing-up of
the establishment account to show assurance
“funds’’ adequate to cover the estimated cur-
rent liability under policies, capital thus
being called upon to carry portion of the
policy obligations. The business transferred
is made up of 7803 policies assuring £242,080,
and the actuarial liability at the end of July
last was £24,500. For it the C.G.A. has paid
£10,000 cash. Consequently, on the
business alone the purchasing co. starts with
a deficit of £34,500-odd. The L.C.A. deal
contributed a deficit of £24,000 or so, and in
addition is the loss on the C.G.A.’s own
activities to date. So there is now a very
large amount to be made good. Managing-
director Thos. Foster is an old hand at In-
dustrial assurance, and believes that be has
struck two bargains in the ready-made busi-
nesses. Whether he has only the future
can tell. The general experience has been
that a small Industrial branch is a millstone
round the neck of a life concern. Neither the
Co-operative nor the C.L.A. was inclined to
face the expenditure necessary to build up
larger connections, which might, or might
not, ultimately prove profitable. The C.G.A.
is setting out to demonstrate that with a
large business costs can be reduced consider-
ably, and that all the heavy initial outlay can
be recouped in due course. The co. now holds
16,600 Industrial policies for approximately a
half-million, producing an annual premium
income of £37,560.

Last year’s profits were £531 less than those
for 1922, when properties had given a re-
turn much better than usual. Taxes have
also been pressing harder; they are taking
about £220 more than in recent years. How-
ever, the co. is doing well enough to warrant
the directors lifting the div. to 8 p.c. The
concern is much more comfortable than it
used to be. The coal city’s industrial develop-
ment permitted the co. to unload a lot of
unremunerative properties it had been nurs-
ing since the collapse of a previous boom
threw securities on its hands: freeholds and
leaseholds now have a hook value of £4727
against £15,306 13 years ago. Evidently
those old assets had stood in the books at
figures in excess of values current for many
years, because while unloading proceeded in
favorable markets £2181 was written off out
of profits in 10 years. Lately, applications
for advances have been in excess of funds
available; deposits on hand have declined
a trifle, and to find money for additional
mortgages—“only selected securities of a
very safe character” —bank overdraft has
been increased to £11,951. Here are balance-

dividend list again, but all it can fork out
is £2 7s. 6d. per £100 share paid to £95.
Since the 1914 distribution the faithful have
followed the Burns-Philp connection and

under rubber, and apparently no attempthas
been made to tap profits from the latter since
the market collapsed. The co. has been con-
tinuously up against the problem of securing
labor teams adequate for its requirements,
owing to recruiting restrictions and the dim-
culty of convincing Frizzytop that work is
a desirable occupation. Even now, the man-
agement is having difficulty in enrolling suf-
ficent “boys” to maintain the cultivated areas
in good condition and to handle the cocoanut
harvest. The output of copra has steadily
increased as plantations have matured: —
1916 . . 192 tons. | 1920 . . 529 tons.
1917 . . 274 „ I 1921 . . 621 „
1918 . . 361 „ 1922 . . 833 „
1919 .. 476 „ I 1923 .. 883 „
But markets have been erratic, and profits
have not expanded in keeping with the larger
production. Anyway, earnings re-absorbed
by plantation maintenance and improvements
are not comforting to shareholders. The
future depends a good deal on whether much
more profit will be mopped up in the same
way, on the plantations continuing in good
health, on an adequate labor supply, and,
first and last, on the copra market. All are
factors more or less outside the directors’
control.

The life assurance flotation boom has not
quite fizzled out. Another concern with a
quarter-million nominal capital, a the Colonial
Provident Life and General, was registered
in Sydney last week. A prospectus has so
far not been sighted.
“A.1.C.A.”: Apart from the retrospective
operation of Sec. 21 of the Act, the principal
objection to the method of assessing Federal
income-tax on cos. (B. 2/8/’23) is the right,
claimed by the Commissioner, to demand tax
without issuing a detailed assessment notice.
A request for explanation as to how the tax
claimed is arrived at is firmly but politely
turned aside. Says Mr. Commissioner : “No
details or information can be given without
disclosing the confidential figures of indi-
vidual shareholders’ returns; but the co. can
itself check the assessment by arranging with
all its shareholders to disclose the requisite
figures.” Imagine the absurdity of a co. with
hundreds or thousands of shareholders en-
deavoring to collate the details of their pri-
vate taxable incomes in order to verify the
Commissioner’s assessment! Yet, unless
such figures are available, the taxed co.
must accept the Commissioner’s say-so in
the dark and pay up in 30 days. The sec-
tion is unworkable and most unbusiness-liKe.
Anyway, the tax under Section 21 does not
appear to have been legally imposed. A flat-
rate tax on each pound of undistributed profits
was imposed in the proper way, but it would
Seem that any further levy (under Sec. 21
of the Assessment Act) is ultra vires under
Section 55 of the Commonwealth Constitu-
tion. That section insists that Acts impos-
ing taxation shall deal with the levying of
tax only, and thus a taxing clause in the
middle of the Assessment Act won’t well
hold water. This contention is supported by
the practice of Parliament in invariably
passing separate Income-tax Acts outlining
the rates of taxes payable on ascertained in-
comes. The matter will doubtless be soon
tested in the courts unless the Government
annuls the present absurd procedure.

There are the makings of a big legal row
in connection with various leases on the
Maitland (N.S.W.) coal-field. The Crown,
as holder of the land, has leased large tracts
to mining cos., and in most cases the leases
embrace land downwards from 50ft. below
the surface, thus leaving the surface and the
upper 50ft. available for disposal otherwise.
Much of the surface has been leased, but
the Crown, as a result of a recent legal
advising, finds that it is liable to claims for
compensation for damage to surface property
resulting from subsidence caused by mining
operations beneath. The cos. holding the
mining leases are legally regarded as tenants
of the Crown, and although they may tear
the innards out of the earth and thereby cause
the collapse of buildings on the surface, the
Crown, as the holder of the land, is
liable, and not the mining cos. as
the lessees. This counsel’s opinion
might be upset by the Courts, but the
Mines Department is taking no risks, and
wherever the surface is sold or leased by the
Crown it now inserts a condition that
“neither the Crown nor any mining lessee
will be liable or responsible for any subsi-
dence or damage caused by or in connection
with mining or other operations whether
carried on beneath the land leased (or sold)
or otherwise.” It is a beautiful dragnet
condition that permits the mining cos. to
do as they like without fear of an action for
damage, and at the same time is designed to
relieve the Department of any responsibility.

The fire in the B. H. Central mine is still
going strong, but is now considered to be
under control. It reached the 1200 ft. level,
and for a time appeared to be dangerously
near Block 10. The water is now up to
the point at which it passes into Block 10
and then overflows into the Proprietary.
This flooding will prevent the fire going
much below the 1100 ft. level. All under-
ground work, mainly opening closed-up cross-
cuts above the supposed location of the fire,
has been stopped for a month. Meanwhile
the fresh-air intakes are being sealed m an
attempt to smother the fire, and all water
possible is being poured in.
* * * *
B. H. Central last week had another nar-
row escape from putting some of its
staft' on the casualty list. Shortly after
knock-off on the 14th a large concentrate
dump collapsed. This dump, which was con-
sidered dry enough for shipment, is being
trucked away. No material has been added
since last year. Half-a-dozen railway
trucks and a siding were caught in the
slide of several thousand tons of zidc con-
centrates. Had the collapse occurred a few
minutes earlier 18 men would liave been
buried.
* * * *
The Central fire is causing the South mine
a little bother. All the boundary stopes have
been kept wetted in case the fire should
spread, and on account of the flooding of the
Central between the 1100 ft. and 1200 ft.
levels the flow of water in the South has
increased. Water is coming through
natural cracks in the boundary pillar of ore
on the South 1270 ft. level, and the 1370 ft.
level is flooded and development work there
is stopped. Additional pumps are being in-
stalled to cope with the increased water. In
addition, the surface subsidence on the
South-Central boundary necessitates con-
tinual maintenance on the South’s railway.
Bega district, South Coast (N.S.W.), has
developed a fully-fledged gold-mine in the
Vimy Ridge, at Tathra. The quartz has a
hungry look, but shows gold freely. C. It.
MacKenzie, late of Cobar Tinto, reported
favorably, and a Sydney group had no diffi-
culty with the float. The co. is in 80,000
shares of 2s. 6d., of which 16,000 paids with
£2750 cash went to the vendors for leases
and a 5-head battery, concentrating table,
engine and pump. The public subscribed 46,000
contribs. at Is. down and Is. on allotment,
and IS.OOO contribs. are held in reserve.
The lode averages from 18in. to 3ft., and
traverses a mountain rising 700 ft. from the
level, the quartz having an easterly under-
lay. Adit tunnels into the hillside have been
met by shafts from the surface, and alto-
gether 72 tons have been treated at Port
Iveinbla for results varying from 15dwt. to
3oz. 16dwt. per ton. Except for 13 tons at
the lower grade, the remainder bulked well
from loz. 15dwt. upwards. One 20-ton
parcel yielded 3oz. 16dwt. Development
work is to be pushed on, and shareholders
should soon learn more of the possibilities in
the Ridge.
* * * *
The old Valentine mine, Tambaroora
(N.S.W.), has been acquired by the nearly-
defunct North Lucknow Extended. There
are two shafts, one down 175 ft. and the
other 120 ft. According to a report by E.
Goodwin, of the Deep Levels, Hill End, the
present vendor syndicate has had an ounce
return from 12 tons at a spot where there
is 140 ft. untouched along the line, but the
reef is less than a foot thick. The David-
son reef used to be the best producer; but
it will have to be unwatered. The big reef
is a large low-grade body, but may be made
to pay if treated on the spot; over 100 tons
carted to Hill End showed a margin despite
heavy costs.
Ex-Speaker Micky Troy tabled a motion
in the Westralian Assembly the other day
seeking the appointment of a Royal Com-
mission to investigate the affairs of the
Empire Syndicate, and to ascertain why ore
reported to be worth ounces crushed only
’weights. Dorrie Doolette, promoter and
chairman of th e syndicate, replies to the
effect that the leases were attractive, high-
grade surface deposits to which additional
prospective value was given by the district’s
good record as a producer. “That they
proved to be surface deposits only, and of
very limited extent,” he adds, “was unfor-
tunate for all concerned, but not a matter
calling for a Royal Commission.”
* * * *
Lake View and Star’s accounts for last
financial year show a profit of £2lBB, and
including the carry-forward the total credit
was £12,521. All this is earmarked for
reorganisation of plant, so shareholders got
nothing. Meanwhile, stories of good de-
velopments at depth, and tales of frequent
divs. when the new plant is in full swing,
are still being told.
South Ivalgurli’s receipts for the year
ended March 31 totalled £167,353. Share-
holders received 2s. 6d. per share, and
£1147 was left to carry forward. Ore of a
higher grade than the average of reserves was
treated, but owing to the striking of excep-
tionally rich ore at the 1600 ft. level the
mine sustained little damage from hauling
the better stuff. The continuation of the
rich make is now being looked for at 1700 ft.
One after the other old Westralian mines
are being tried again, mostly by local syndi-
cates. The latest is the Ladv Shenton. at
Menzies, where ex-Minister Hugh Mahon
once ran a newspaper and Gregory, M.H.R..
a pub. In their time thousands of ounces of
gold were produced monthly, and about
£120,000 was paid in divs. by the original
co. before it ceased operations in 1903. Since
then portion of the mine was worked for
years on a smaller scale, but latterly opera-
tions have been practically at a standstill.
A co. has now been floated to search for
the continuation of the rich shoot.
Queensland Mines Minister Alf Jones has
granted the Elliott, Hampden-Cloncurry and
Cuthbert copper cos.. a further exemption
of three months to give W. L. Baillieu. an
opportunity to develop his scheme to amal-
gamate Cloncurry interests and lay down
a central treatment-plant. The Minister
discloses that the State Collieries are linked
with the proposals : —
If they continue smelting, their fuel will be
obtained from the Bowen State mine. The Govern-
ment will sell to the companies all the small coal
from Bowen seam and coal from the Garrick seam,
which is splendid for coke-making ; and it will
allow the companies to erect their own coking
plant on the Bowen coalfield area. This coal will
be available to them at a reasonable price. I am
satisfied that, if they do this, it will mean a
reduction in the cost of the production of copper of
£6 a ton.
On Monday first-mortgage debenture-holders
raked over Mt. Cuthbert ashes with a view
to reconstructing. The last balance-sheet
showed £55,000 of debentures, bank and other
creditors for £26,220 secured by prior lien
bonds, and other debts for £24,838. Against
this total of £106,558 were liquid assets for
about £16,000. The new scheme provides for
a co. with nominal capital of £400,000, in
which the debenture-holders will receive fully-
paids for their principal and outstanding in-
terest, but how other parties stand under
the proposal is not clear at the moment. Of
course, the prior-lien crowd come in ahead
of the debentures.
* * * *
July gold returns for Queensland totalled
7060oz. (fine), an increase of 64oz. over
July, 1922. Considering the Scottish-Gym-
pie is now out, the return is encouraging;
the leeway was made up chiefly by Mt.
Coolon, which weighed in with 1080oz. This
held now runs an easy second to Mt. Mor-
gan, having displaced Gympie and the
Towers. For the half-year to June, the
State produced 40,406oz. (fine) against
28,753oz. for the same period last year.
* * * * *
Prospecting is active at Brookfield, near
Brisbane, although a couple of the smaller
shows got exemption last week. Eclipse,
which includes the more promising of the ori-
ginal claims, has put down a new shaft and
cut several nice-looking formations carrying
gold. The biggest body of stone so far is
between 2ft. and 3ft. The rich streak of
mundic, which assays up to 50oz., seems to
be persistent, and it alone makes the reef
well worth while. Joe Wilson, formerly of
Mt. Mudlo, is managing the mine.
Chillagoe district (N.Q.), which has sup-
plied several promising developments in the
Girofla, Consols and others in the last two
vears, has come to light with a virgin silver-
lead lode. The outcrop is so good that there
has been a mild scramble to get in on the
ground floor. Galena shows freely in the
lode, which runs to 4ft. or 5ft., and has been
followed for half-a-mile. The country rock is
an intrusion of quartz-porphyry in limestone,
a contact which has produced practically all
the important deposits in the district.
& * * *
Here is an example of the class of tin-
ore Herberton (N.Q.) is capable of turning
out occasionally. The Lucky Hit mine re-
cently returned 54 tons 75 p.c. concentrates
worth £673 from 15 tons ore. Every ton
taken out was worth £45, and at the bottom
of the shaft there is a shoot 9ft. by 18in.
of the same stuff. The Wild Irishman dur-
ing July, crushed 49J tons for 9 tons con-
centrates, averaging £18 a ton. The
Arbouin’s return was 680 tons for 27 tons,
worth £2538. _
* * * w
The breakdown of the gas-producing plant
has necessitated the closing down of milling
and treatment at the Derek tin-mines, stan-
nary Hills (N.Q.). Before ceasing opera-
tions 275 tons ore had been treated tor
slightly more than three tons concentrates.
The battery at Rocky Bluffs has been kept
busy since May, 620 tons ore producing 21
tons black tin worth £1890. From the
Arbouin 550 tons stone returned 14 tons
tin The outlook generally is bright and
many of the small shows are employing labor.
Ravenswood (Q-). though only a shadow of
its former self, still produces a little gold.
Last month the Duke Shaft gave 120 tons
for a return of 209oz. In addition, 345
bags of prill ore and 400 bags of concentrates
were forwarded to the Chillagoe smelters.
The Empress, Herberton (N.Q.), is now
employing about a dozen miners and de-
spatching 200 tons copper ore weekly to
Chillagoe. # *
Lander Oil, outside Roma (Q-), has com-
menced field operations in earnest. The site
for the first bore is in the tiger scrub four
miles from Orallo siding, and a few acres
have already been cleared and 150 tons of
plant and the material for two houses are
on the ground. The rest of the gear is on
its way from Brisbane. The boilers were
made by Walkers, of Maryborough, but the
boring ‘plant, the latest in rotaries, came
from ’Frisco. A small bore to provide water
for drilling is to be put down, and the
Fifes, brothers of Roy, the Californian who
is superintending Associated’s plant at
Mount Gambier (S.A.), expect to commence
boring next month.
Associated Oil, Mt. Gambier (S.A.),
spent £2OOO-odd on plant and £3400
on boring during the six months to
June 30: driller Roy Fife punched
down 1160 ft. for slightly less than
£3 per foot. The main hole went to 2290 ft.,
when the strain became too great for the
pumping plant, and pending the arrival of
new equipment the directors decided to put
the staff to work on a test bore, which js
now down 280 ft. Associated has been cheered
up a little by two other cos. making a start
in the district: the S. Aus. Oilwells, under
Dod, is busy at Nelson, to the south-east,
and on the nor’-west side, at Coorong, the
Coorong Co., under De Hautpick’s guidance,
is getting to work. The three cos. have de-
cided to exchange data, and that should be
helpful to all. Enthusiasts declare that it
has never been disputed that the south-east
of S. Aus. is one of the largest tertiary
deposits known, and that conditions appeal
to the oil-seeker. The sea from the south
in prehistoric times extended almost to
Bourke (N.S.W.), the filling-in having come
from the silts of the old-time rivers and the
gradual raising by earth movement. Some
Associated shareholders have already be-
come wearied of the chase, and at June 30 1
£3328 of the first call was outstanding. But
it is a limited-liability go, and the directors
propose to take action against defaulters.
Another call of 2s. 6d. will probably be made
next month.

“Parchment”: Denison Miller gave a final
proof of his financial ability by dying on
June 6, 24 davs before the end of the finan-
cial year for Federal taxation purposes. His
old chief, Russell French, went one better by
dying on June 30; but this was running
things rather close. The Federal Income
Tax Act aims at effecting that the Govern-
ment should not take two bites at a man’s
property in one and the same year. When
a man dies, the Government takes part of his
capital by way of estate duty, so he is not
charged with income-tax for the financial
year in which his death takes place. The
idea may be all right, but the way of the
Commonwealth law is clumsy and inequit-
able. If either of these wealthy men had
lived till after June 30, even if only a few
hours, the Federal taxation authorities would

have been entitled to income-tax up to June
30, and estate duty as well. As it was, they
both avoided paying a full year’s income-
tax. The exact date of a rich man’s death
may, therefore, make a considerable differ-
ence to the amount his family has to pass
over to the Federal Government.
* * * *
“Dinky Di”: Re bayonet-wounds in the
war. I can give some first-hand testimony
that the Hun suffered no casualties worth
mentioning from cold steel. Fritz pounded
me at Hangard Wood, and I spent five months
at the Festungs Lazaret, on the Rhine, where
I had the job of dressing the wounded in
the daytime and carrying the dead out at
night. (No, I didn’t bury them.) There
were a dozen operations daily, Sunday in-
cluded, and I attended most of them. Dur-
ing that time I saw only one bayonet-
wound, and the Bavarian who exhibited
that curiosity had been asleep on outpost, and
never knew how he got it. Some day the
War Office will realise that the bayonet is
an obsolete weapon. If the Diggers had
sported a pair of wirecutters at the end ol
their Lee-Enfields they would have had fewer
casualties.
* * * *
“Exul” on the aspersed spud:—
“Lomkey Ree’s” assault on the potato (B.
2/8/’23) as an article of diet might well have been
written under the influence of spirit distilled from
the vegetable. The chief constituent of the potato,
and the one to which he attributes bodily rheu-
matism and mental turbulence, is carbo-hydrate, and
when this is taken into the body it is completely
broken down into carbon-dioxide and water, any
excess being excreted by the kidneys as sugar or
stored up in the tissues as fat or glycogen. Under
no circumstances does it produce uric acid, which
is entirely derived from the proteins (meat) of the
diet or the body cells. In any case, no modern doctor
believes that uric acid has anything to do with rheu-
matism, which is essentially a disease caused by
germs, riot by food. But, if a campaign is to be
conducted against carbo-hydrates, why select the
potato for special animosity ? The starch in this
has been found by such great authorities as the late
Professor Osier to do less harm, even when eaten
by diabetics, than most other forms of starch or
sugar. Bread contains three times as much starch
as potatoes. The steadily increasing proportion of
diabetics in the community is due to bread, sugar,
lollies, etc., rather than potatoes. Probably more
uric acid is produced in N.S.W. than anywhere else
in the world, because its consumption of meat per
head is the greatest, yet lheumatism is not markedly
prevalent there.
“Sir Spen”: The term “pulling your leg,”
referred to by “Oxmead” (B. 2/8/’23), dates
back to the days when ’buses were the only
means of public conveyance running the
London streets. Passengers made their exits
and their entrances through a door at the
rear, a couple of steps connecting with the
ground. In those days the driver had to
be conductor as well, and to protect him
against “scalers” he had a cord attached to
his leg. The other end was connected with
the door; when the latter was opened the
string tightened and acted as a signal to
Jehu. Naturally, the street urchin of the
period found much amusement in jumping on
the steps, opening the door sharply and re-
alighting, whereupon the driver, thinking an-
other passenger had surreptitiously dis-
embarked, would proceed to investigate, only
to find that “his leg had been pulled.”

“R.R.”: There are globetrotting Britons
of a new variety since the war finished. I
met one in Sydney recently who told me
cheerfully that, since he was demobbed,
he has been to
U.S.A., Canada,
South Africa and
Brazil, all at the
expense of kindly
organisations which
aim at giving hard-
up ex-soldiers a
fresh start in a
new country.
Other sympathetic
organisations, im-
pressed by his un-
suitability for these
new surroundings,
have returned him
in due course; and
now that he has
arrived in Austra-
lia he is confidently-
looking forward to
someone appearing
with the fare for
the return journey.
He told me that
he knows men who
have done more
travelling than him-
sel f. “Aboard
sh i p,” he added
philosophically, “a
man is at least safe
for his tucker.”
He left me wonder-
ing how much the
Commonwealth has
invested in this
kind of immigrant.
“Jacques”: After the Lagnicourt stunt
(25/4/T7) George and I, out after “souvs,”
came across a dead Fritz. George drew a
blank in his tunic-pockets, a few more blanks
in his trousers-pockets, and turned him over
with no better luck. Then George looked up
at me with disgust. “Some dirty cow has
robbed him,” he said.

“Fana”: The insubordination on the
Geranium was a storm in a teacup compared
with what happened in the early part of
1917 on the Una, then on patrol work in the
waters of New Guinea and the Bismarck
Archipelago. But there was a rigid war cen-
sorship in those days; hence not a word
about the mutiny was published. A small
handful of I.W.W.’s are believed to have
been responsible for the outbreak, which took
place near the Solomons. Aiming to make
thi ship helpless, they rushed the bridge and
threw overboard the compass and navigating
instruments, including sextant and chart-

cases. At the same time some lunatic turned
on the tap of the petrol-tank, situated on the
bridge-deck. The mutiny was promntly
quelled and the ringleaders ironed. Subse-
quently an inquiry was held, followed by a
court-martial; some of those concerned wove
sentenced to imprisonment, others were dis-
tributed amongst the crews of English, ves-
sels then in the North Sea. The incident
partly accounted for the seeming ferocity
with'which the I.W.W. was chased out of
the country.
* * * *
“Schnorrer”: A neat dig at long-winded
prosy speakers was delivered by Rabbi Cohen
at a recent gathering of the Chosen in Syd-
ney. lie was called on after a couple of dull
persons had set the audience thinking of
the hour and home. “I am down for an
address,” said he, looking at his watch, “but
in view of the late hour I’ll be brief and
simnly say that it is 91 Macleay-street.”
Then he went to it.
•“Tarago”: Two and a half years with the
troops left memories of only theee bayonet
“incidents” impressed on my memory. The
first concerned a Pommy-Australian inmate
of Hartford Auxiliary Hospital. He had
been a prisoner under escort, and attempted
to bolt. One of the escort stopped him with
a jab in the calf of the leg. The second was
also a prisoner, at Rollestone (Eng.). He
was bayoneted through the chest by one of
the guard, who had some excuse for his
drastic action. This chap died an hour later.
The third incident was in France. During
a hop-over one of cur chans and a F’"tz
made at one other with bayonets fixed. We
stopped to watch the result, but before they
got together another Fritz stood up in a
shellhole and shot our man. He was no
sport, and we threw four Mills bombs into
his shellhole to impress the fact on him. In-
cidentally, it was rare to find a German rifle
with the bayonet fixed. It was as rare
to pick up one of ours with the bayonet
unfixed.
* # • #
“Cartot”: A much more fatuous war-time
yarn than the one about the German dead
being returned to their Fatherland for
burial was the highly circumstantial story of
Hun corpses being boiled down to make gly-
cerine for the manufacture of explosives.
Yet it travelled widely and died hard, if, in-
deed, it is quite dead yet. Apart from the
hideous imputation on humanity that the
story contained, any chemist would have
pronounced it utterly preposterous. While
it would be possible to prepare pure glycerol,
or glycerine, from a human corpse—the com-
pound being the result of treating fats with
alkalis, or with superheated steam —the aver-
age war-time body would not yield more than
an ounce or two of the substance. Yet cen-
sorship was so strict in Australia that at
least one paper was refused permission in
1917 to publish an article by a chemist in
which the story was rejected as a stupidly
malignant invention.
“Tope e” en-
counters a philan-
thropist :
Seated in a Quay-
bound tram I held a
parcel for a portly,
prosperous -looking
gentleman —apparently
somewhat under the
weather —w hi 1 e he
climbed up from the
wrong side. Recover-
ing his breath, he
pointed to my silver
R.S. badge and said:
“You have done your
devoir, sir. Man pro-
mises much and per-
forms little; yet are
we all in the hands of
Providence. Have a
smoke!”—and he
handed me six inches
of transcendent quali-
ity. At No. 1 wharf
I excused myself, but
he said he would alight
with me and walk to
his own port of em-
barkation. He abso-
lutely refused to take
his parcel, saying:
“Please accept it. It
will do you more good
that it is likely to do
me. Good-day, sir. It
has been a privilege to
have met you!” He
raised his hat and
walked off. When I
got home I examined
the gift. It consisted
of 13 eggs wrapped in
wadding. The wife
found them useful, but,
judging by the mystic
number and the wad-
ding, I am afraid that
a clutch from a prize
laying strain has gone astray in transit from some-
where to somebody.

“Cyrano” from the vanishing box-seat:—
Horse coaching in Maorilaml has almost dis-
appeared before the attack of the railway and the
motor. The opening of the Odra tunnel puts the
most interesting and most picturesque service in
M.L., and probably in Australasia, out of action. The
Otira gorge, up which a road was hewn nearly 60
years ago, was one of the sights of the country.
To rattle down that steep path and swing round its
hairpin bends, with mountains towering above you
and the off-wheels unpleasantly close to the edge of
a precipice that dropped to the boulder bed of the
rushing, glacier-fed Otira, wap an unforgettable
experience. For many years it was a two-days’
coach trip between rail-hcads; sometimes the un-

“ Right-oh , daddy. Bill is just going."
bridged Waimakariri would rise, and passengers
might be held up for days. To drive the high five-
horsed coaches in all sorts of weather, backwards
and forwards over Arthur’s Pass (3000 feet), re-
quired exceptional skill and nerve, and those who
did it were picked men. The type is well-nigh
extinct in M.L., and most of the “copy” it holds
will die with it. Latterly the run was reduced to
the 10 miles over the pass and down the gorge,
and there was something fitting in the fact that
the procession of coaches was always led by Hall,
a grey-bearded veteran of over 70, who dated back
to the bushranging days in Australia. In all the
years of coaching only one life was lost—an infant
that was crushed by the overturning of a coach.
The railway runs right under the pass and the
gorge, and it is a question whether it will pay to
maintain the most fascinating bit of road in the
country.
THE FAITHFUL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
High o’er the heads of kneeling throngs,
In true-believing eastern lands,
The ringing-voiced muezzin stands
Announcing there,
In fervent words as sweet as songs,
The hour of prayer.
Yet none adore this goddess bright;
Though her immortal spirit breaks
From the rough boughs in rosy flakes
To bless the year.
None wait to hail with holy rite
Her drawing near.
Man her divinity forgets,
But when she rises from the north
Still her impassioned priests come forth
On eager wing,
And from their leafy minarets
Proclaim the Spring.

“Bill R”: When all the fancy ideas re
the origin of “getting the wind up” have
been expounded, let me in with the true his-
tory of the much-labored term. It was
derived from a circus gag of a. half-century
ago. In a spook act that killed time in
every travelling circus performance of those
days, the clown, seized with violent shivers
at the sight of the ghost, and being up-
braided thereon by the ringmaster, tremb-
lingly disclaimed fear, but accounted for the
unsteadiness of his pins by saying, the “wind
had got up” the legs of his capacious pants.
It was left for the war to bring the phrase
into general use.
A BIRD IN A MILLION.
“Can ’e talk! Lumme, lady, when ’e sings ‘The Willage Black-
smith,’ the sparks fly out of ’is bloomin’ tail!"
Jack McLaren among the Moslems :
Lord Headley, head of the British Mussulmans
and husband of one-time Sydney presswoman Bar-
bara Baynton, has gone on the pilgrimage,to Mecca,
and will renew his acquaintance with the Emir
Abdulla, ruler of the new State of Trailsjordania. 1
was in England when the Emir went to London to
get the blessing of the British Government, and was
taken by Headley to the mosque at Woking to
attend the religious reception. With us went Mrs.
Mutch, wife of Tom Mutch, Minister for Education
in the late Dooley Government. It was a queer little
ceremony, with the “Allah, Allah, Abukas!’’ sound-
ing strangely out of place over the Essex countryside,
and white and Arab and Indian Moslems, all in
national costume, bowing to the earth. But the
Emir confessed that the thing of greatest interest to
him was the presence of two Australians, we being
the first of our race he had actually met, though he
had heard much of our prowess in battle and sport.
Speaking in Arabic to his Prime Minister, who trans-
lated the remarks in French to an Oxford-taught son,
who in turn rendered them into English, he expressed
a great love for Australia, and hoped Mrs. Mutch’s
“ruler-husband’’ would retain the love of his people,
as he hoped to retain the love of his own. He put
it very neatly and graciously. I got on well with
that Arab king. In fact, if ever I visit Transjordania
I mean to come at him for a free pass over his rail-
ways (if any).
* * *' *
“F.A.”: “Oxmead’s” recollections (B.
9/8/’23) of W.A.’s saltwater Governor Bed-
ford remind me of Viking Rawson’s visit
to Tweed Heads. This was at the time
when precautions against the cattle-tick
were being rigidly enforced by N. S. Wales.
The Stock Inspector’s house was situated
on the boundary-line between the ticky
State and N.S.W., and here Sir Harry was
entertained at lunch by the “heads.” Re-
plying to the toast of his health, the .old
salt referred jocularly to the tick question.
“We don’t care a rap how much you Queens-
landers growl,” he announced, “our stock
must be kept clean, and as long as I am
in X. S. Wales I will see that it is.” Here
an interjector informed the speaker that he
was not in the Mother State, and convinced
him of the fact by rolling back the cloth:
the table was found to be bisected by a
blue line with a large “Q.” on the side
nearer the Governor and “N.S.W.” on the
other. Instantly his Ex. apologised for
drinking in enemy territory and said he felt
he must get the taste of those “pegs” out
of his mouth by shifting into home waters
and having a few there. And he dick
“Sierra”: Lord Northcliffe’s rendering of
a well-worn Australianism as “fare cow”
reminds me that a new word was officially
coined in Sydney a couple of years ago.
Scandinavian witnesses were explaining in
court how a quarrel arose, on a timber-
schooner. Accused, they said, was hauling
on a boat’s tackle, and called out “Morbif ! ’
The magistrate jibbed at the word, but the
Swedes maintained that it was a good Eng-
lish word always used by seamen when they
wanted help on a rope. So “morbif” went
down on the record as the nautical equiva-
lent of “help wanted.” What the } square-
heads meant to say was “more beef.”
“Wilfrido”: The
question whether a
man is drunk never
seems to puzzle the
John Hops, although
it frequently causes, a
divergence of magis-
terial opinion when it
comes before the
Court. I have seen
one Beak give the con-
sumer of five whiskies
the benefit of the
doubt and another
convict on four beers;
but whether the ac-
cused goes quietly to
the lockup or violently
protests en route, he is
likely to face a charge
of being bitterly
bottled provided the
police depose to a
marked weirdness in
his movements. In a
recent M.L. case a
returned Digger had
been strenuously en-
gaged in rebutting the
accusation that he was
drunk while in charge
of a motor-car. “The
admissions of the de-
fendant, firstly, that
he had met a regi-
mental friend whom
he had not seen since
the war; secondly,
that he had four whis-
kies and half a bottle
of champagne; and,
thirdly, that he col-
lide d with three
vehicles within the
space of a couple of
hundred yards,” said
the Beak suavely,
“while they do not prove that he was
drunk, are circumstances that assist this
Court' in arriving at the conclusion that he
was certainly not sober.”
“X2X”: Tennyson Smith, of the roving
tongue, has been declaiming against the prac-
tice of vivisection in the Australian Univer-
sities, and garnishing his charges with a
yarn about 151 kangaroos whose brains were
dissected for scientific purposes. I unhesi-
tatingly assert that throughout the whole
Commonwealth there is not a scientific in-
stitution —teaching or research —where any-
thing that can be called vivisection goes on,
unless the term can be applied to the occa-
sional pithing of a frog, or the chloroform-
ing of a dog for the benefit of physiology
and xiharmacological students. In the course
of more than 10 years’ close acquaintance
with most of the scientific laboratories and
institutions of the Commonwealth, I have
never seen or heard of an animal of any
kind being subjected to the tortures hinted
at by Tennyson Smith. On the few occa-
A QUESTION OF HEADS AND SHOULDERS.
THE PHILOSOPHER (discussing a local scandal ): “Well, after all,
you can’t put old heads on young shoulders.”
THE CYNIC: “No, I suppose not. Yet I have seen a stranger thing
— girls’ heads on men’s shoulders.”
sions when an animal is used for scientific
purposes, and for the ultimate benefit of
mankind, every precaution is taken to guard
against its suffering from any pain, and, in
the great majority of cases, it is first anses-
theticised.
“Lex” for the defence: —
The Bulletin (16/8/’23), in a note on the late
Judge Docker (N.S.W.), observed that many of the
stories retailed about him were “apocryphal. ’ A
stronger phrase should be applied to some of them.
For example, take this one printed lately in Sydney:
One of the earliest rememberable instances of his
wit was upon an occasion when, in his charge to a
jury, he referred to an assertion made by the
prisoner’s advocate as being “something stated to
yc i by an attorney not yet struck off the rolls.”
Docker had his defects as a Judge. But he was
a sound lawyer, and in particular he knew all about
the libel law. Odgers (“Libel and Slander”) says:
“A critic must confine himself to criticism, and not
make it a veil for personal censure, nor allow himself
to run into reckless and unfair attacks merely from
the love of exercising his power of denunciation.”
And again: “dur law permits anyone to say, write
and publish what he pleases; but if he makes a bad
use of this liberty he must be punished.’’ The people
who coin these yarns imagine, apparently, that a
Judge can publish a wanton libel on a citizen wit.i
impunity provided he does it from the Bench. Such
is not the law. if Docker had been guilty of the
gross outrage attributed to him he would have been
liable to an action for damages like any private
individual. And long before the suit was listed le
would have been removed from the Bench as unfit
to occupy it.
“Flicker”: “Playing the wag,” or “wag-
ging it” (“Oxmead,” B. 2/8/’23), is not a
coined-in-Australia phrase. I find that in
“Dombey and Son” (chapter 22) Rob the
Grinder tells Mr. Carker that his troubles
“all began with wagging from school. So
the expression must have been in fairly gen-
eral use in Dickens’s time. Imported to
this country, like so many other slang
phrases, it may have survived after falling
into disuse in England.
Not all ears are ravished by
the same sounds. A well-known M.L. ento-
mologist and his wife were strolling along a
road on the outskirts of the town, when
music poured with its voluptuous swell from
p. hall wherein the Choral Society was prac-
tising. The lady, who has musical tastes,
stopped to listen; so did her husband to
the chirping of a cricket. After a while the
choir finished, and the cricket had it to
himself. Said the lady, ecstatically, “Wasn t
it lovely?” “Yes,” agreed the scientist with
entire heartiness —“do you know, my dear,
they make that beautiful music by rubbing
their hind legs together?”
“Deco” takes the
wheel: —
In my remote and
care-free youth I was
once cook’s boy on a
steamer trading to the
Clarence River
(N.S.W.), and one of
my duties was to take
up cups of tea to the
old man. He was a
gruff but kindly old
sea-dog, and when he
asked me to hold the
wheel while he drank
his tea, I felt honored
beyond all measure,
and obeyed his “Port”
or “Starboard” with
brisk alacrity. One
morning, after crossing
the bar, the skipper,
who had finished his
tea on the bridge, told
me to keep her on her
course for a minute till
he returned, and on no
account to let go the
wheel. My heart swelled
with pride at being left
in charge of a 500-ton
steamer at 14 years of
age, but as the min-
utes dragged on a
feeling of nervousness
succeeded. Why didn’t
the old man return?
Had he been taken ill
and been unable to
inform the chief offi-
cer? Did he drink?
Then, ahead of me
and coming north,
appeared another
coaster! As she ap-
proached, I could see
it was necessary to
haul out a bit, but was
afraid to act without
the skipper. Just then
he came up the com-
panion with a cheery
“Good, sonny, we’ll
make a sailor of you
yet!” He took the
wheel and I went down
to the main deck immediately below the bridge.
At the hand-steering gear was an A.B. grinning
broadly. The steam-gear on the bridge had been dis-
connected immediately we crossed the bar. But I d
stood my test.

“iHermes”: Being a postal employee
myself, I would like to record the fact that
there is at least one other. person in the
service who possesses imagination. Most
letter-carriers mark undeliverable letters
with the conventional “Gone away-left no
address,” but a letter addressed to Captain
Blank, Blankville, was returned not long
back marked: “He went mad, so they shot
him.”
CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.
WIFEY : “Oh, goodness, I have lost my ring!
It was a little loose, and must have got
caught somewhere and slipped off.”
HUBBY: “Yes, I found it in my pocket.”
THE PERFECT MINISTER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The Methodist minister (Rev. W. Coleman)
declared that too much was expected of a minister,
but he must have mentality and morality, whilst the
ladies demanded some beauty.”—Sun.
As fervent as a man may be,
And stuffed with splendid piety,
Of little use to-day is he
As mentor to society
Unless his moral plane is high,
In mind he has affinity
To sages, and he wears an eye
That dazzles femininity.
Behold Adonis as he stands
And waves his arms prodigiously,
As on the Devil’s works he lands
With left and rights religiously!
His mind and morals both have grade;
Yet all the girls are dithery,
So handsome he, they’d go*the pace
E’en though the path was slithery.
Unless he is a man like this,
Although he toils distressfully,
Vain all his earnest trouble is
To guide a flock successfully.
As showing what the type should be
To preach ’gainst evils sinister,
My picture, with due modesty,
I give—the Perfect Minister !

The Four Tests of an Assurance Company
HP HE nature of Life Assurance, the fact that it constitutes
-*■ ® promise of payment to your wife, child or dependant
at a critical period of their lives, demands the unshakeable
stability of the company issuing it. The following four tests
reveal the unassailable position of the Producers & Citizens’
Life Assurance Co. of Australia Ltd.
FOUNDATION.—The Producers & Citizens’ is based on a solid
rock of the primary producer—the backbone of the commu-
nity and on whom the very existence of the country depends.
By its agreements with the leading farmer and grazier co-
operative bodies in each state the Producers & Citizens’ is
linked with the most substantial section of the community.
VOLUME, —For a company of similar age, the Producers &
Citizens’ created an Australasian record during the last two
years by writing three million pounds of new business.
QUALITY.—The high quality of the business written and the
fact that the Renewal Premiums actually reached the
remarkable figure of 85 p.c. in its first two years testify
to the sound policy of the company.
MANAGERIAL AlMS.—Conservative financial methods plus a progres-
siveness in enlarging the scope of the Company and in giving utmost
assistance to the man on the land hy means of co-operation.
By assuring: With the Producers & Citizens’ you obtain maximum stability
with the particular benefits that follow the co-operative principle.

1 ew men in the Senate were better liked
than the scholarly and picturesque Tom Bak-
hap. He never pretended to be what he
wasn’t: lie was the brainy son of a former
leader of the Chinese village at Ballarat
by an Irish mother. Crossing in his youth
to Tasmania, he got interested in tin-mining,
and Bakhap’s opinion on a tin proposition
was presently valued. For 10 years he had
looked like outlasting most of the present
members; for h e was still well under CO at
the unexpected end. The Tas. Parliament
will have to nominate his successor; and
J. 11. Keating is the name in most mouths.
Though half-Chinese in origin, the late
Senator Bakhap’s countenance had no salient
Mongolian characteristic. His eyes were
bright and brown, his moustache colossal
and his pose ancient Roman in its command-
ing aquilinity. When he first appeared in
the. Senate he disclosed his soul in a speech
which was a marvel of ornamental ver-
bosity. Crowded to the epiglottis with gran-
diose adjectives, he poured them out in a
terrifying flood that kept the most expert
Hansard reporter scurrying in piteous pur-
suit. That was his lone effort, however.
Afterwards he adopted the routine jargon
of the House, and only shone occasionally
as a gallant and well-read Chairman of
Committees. The best tale told of him is
that in his zeal for correct English he once
privately admonished a member for using
split infinitives. The member was thunder-
struck. “Why,” he faltered, “split infini-
tives are surely allowable in moderation.'’
“Perhaps so,” answered Bakhap, “but, yon
see, you use so many that your speeches look
like battlefields.”

Organist.
Many politicians , may marry in Canberra
in future, but Senator Walter Duncan will
always have the distinction of having been
the first. He wedded Kathleen Cumming
there recently at St. John’s Church. This
is Duncan’s second matrimonial plunge; his
first wfife was the daughter of E. Riley,
M.H.R., who still sits with the party which
Duncan left.
Harry Cornish, who for half-a-century was
one of the picturesque features of Cobar
(A.S.W.), passed out the other day at
Botany. After Campbell, Hartmann and
Gibb found the indications of copper at a
blacks’ waterhole in 1870 and Joseph Becker,
storekeeper of Bourke, Russell Barton and
“Gundabooka Smith” formed the first Cobar
Co., Cornish went up with the Govern-
ment surveyor, Evans, and drove in the first
survey-pegs. To locate the outlandish spot
Evans had recourse to stellar observations.
Cornish became part and parcel of Cobar
from that time, and had much to do with the
development of the town and the subsequent
discovery and mining of gold deposits in the
district. He stuck to the old place long after
its glory had departed, but left it last Sep-
tember, and went to live with a son at
Botany. He was 81 when his last shift-
whistle blew.
Over 60 years ago there came to Rock-
hampton (Q.) a young French couple named
Thozet, who settled a few miles out of town
at the place now known as the Kalka Shades.
The husband was a skilful gardener, and
it was he who established the Rockhampton
Botanical Gardens, which have an Austra-
lian reputation. Ilis own place he converted
into a glory, and besides flowers grew arrow-
root, cotton, to-
bacco, oats and
barley. He wrote
several brochures
on native flora, and
sent many seeds
and specimens to
E u r o p e. Some
time before his
death he visited
France, and was
greatly honored.
The widow has
just died at 87,
aft e r living all
alone amidst the
departed splendors
of what is now but
a rambling wilder-
ness.
KILLEN, M.H.R.
for Riverina,
who greatly
amused the House
last 'week by
asking it to con-
sider a bill to
reduce members'
salaries.
Died at Adelaide the other day at 85,
Richard Marshall, the great wheat-breeder
of S.A. He never pushed into politics, but
contributed more to the making of surpluses
Ilian regiments of State Treasurers. His
life was devoted to the selection of wheats
chiefly to beat the red rust, and he had 70
years of farm work and 90 varieties of wheat
to his credit, including Marshall’s No. 3,
which is known all over the world.
Adelaide is not to lose Prof. Wood-Jones
after all. The brilliant young anatomist was
not expected to resist the offer of a profes-
sorship at London Uni., with the command
of Bart’s Hospital thrown in ; but he came
to Australia mainly to study the marsupials,
and three years, with all hjs spare time given
to that research, have only sharpened his
appetite for more.
The Speck’s luckiest politician is Alex.
Mean. First elected to the Assembly in
1903, Hean has filled some paid office almost
continuously since 1904. He was Lands
Minister during Evans’s regime (1904-09)
and under Elliott Lewis (1909-12) ; he was
Chairman of Committees in the Solomon era,
and a minor billet was even found for him
during the Labor regime (1914-16). When
Lee displaced Labor (1916) the Hean star
went into temporary eclipse, but he shone
again in Lee’s Ministry of 1919-22 as Lands
and Works; was Honorary in the just-
departed Hayes team, and is Attorney-Gen-
eral and Minister of Education in Lee’s
latest lot. About the best-liked member in
the Assembly, his sense of humor and sym-
pathetic Scotch burr are good inside assets.
All the same, he seldom wins an election
without a tough contest.
Gerald Piggott, who is to be the Com-
missioner to inquire into the faulty construc-
tion of Warrnambool (Vic.) breakwater, was
George Higinbotham’s associate 32 years
ago, and had a tremendous admiration
for his chief. When he set out as a bar-
rister, Piggott gave promise of bigger things
than he has accomplished.
Frederick Baglin, sentenced to three years
last week for the theft of some hundreds of
pounds from the Fremantle (W.A.) Council
of the A.L.P., was, until a day or two before
his trial, one of the members of the State
Leg. Council. For nearly 20 years he has
been a well-known figure in trades-union
circles, first on the goldfields and later on
the coast. A strenuous contester of selection
ballots, he narrowly missed winning the Han-
nans seat in the. W.A. Assembly as long ago
as lyoB, and persevered determinedly until
fortune at last smiled on him three and a
half years ago. Baglin was a railwayman
before he took to Trades Hall polemics and
Labor politics for a living.
Closed his account in Brisbane at 79, ex-
banker Edward Griffith. He was the only
brother of the late Chief Justice of the
Federal High Court, and it was three years
to the' day between the deaths of the two.
After retiring from the management of the
Royal Bank Edward Griffith took up audit-
ing and accountancy, was for some years
auditor to the Brisbane Metropolitan Water
Board, and excited the envy of many of the
Board’s best figure men by his faculty for
adding up three columns of £ s. d. at a
single operation.
W. B. Rounsevell, the old politician lately
dead in Adelaide, was a convert to theo-
sophy in later life, and, giving up his old
hospitable ways, for some years went with-
out liquor, tobacco or meat. Now about
half his estate of £24,000 goes to the local
Tlieosophical Society ; £lOOO to Leadbeater’s
“Liberal Catholic Church,” when established
in S.A.; and £lOO to the Harbinger oe
Light, in Melbourne.
R. J. Noble, who has just come back from
the U.S.A. with the right to call himself
Dr. Bob, which he probably won’t exercise,
was the first of the Ben Fuller scholars who
are entitled to go abroad seeking more know-
ledge for the good of Australia. The son
of Alexander Noble, a lately-retired N.S.W.
school inspector, R.J. took "to science early,
and now knows so much about rust in wheat
and such-like that the Agricultural Depart-
ment has appointed him director of its
important biological section.
Except a few small legacies, all of the
£45,000 left by David Hennessy, former
Mayor of Melbourne, goes to his widow and
daughters. Provision had already been made
for the only son, so he doesn’t appear in
the will.
Big John McWhae, Yic. Agent-General,
will throw up his job next July—seven
months before his three years are up. He is
probably home-sick now the attractions of
London have dulled a bit, and perhaps he
has also been disillusioned like Murray
Smith, Berry, Gillies, Taverner and Peter
Mcßride were. As for a successor, State
Treasurer McPherson would be the man if it
would suit him to go to London for three
years.
James Ormond, who slipped over the bor-
der the other day at Malvern (Melb.), used
to be business partner of James Service
(twice Vic. Premier), who died a quarter
a century back. Ormond looked closely
after the wholesale grocery while Service
helped to run the country ; but Service was
always the man who counted in big issues.
Ormond was within five years of the century
when the call came.
“D.O’R.” : Forty years ago Judge Docker
was present at my father’s funeral, and last
week I attended his. I knew him well in his
home and in sport, and, at heart, no kindlier
man ever lived. I played tennis with him not
three years ago : he was slow on his feet, but
his shots were wonderfully true and strong
for a man 79 years of age. When Anderson
was playing Patterson shortly after, the old
Judge came on to the ground, a conspicuous
figure in his frock coat, white beard and silk
hat. He peered through the wire netting as
close as he could get, watching every stroke
with the keenest interest. I joined him, and
said: “Last year I was looking for a partner
in the Veterans’ Match.” He answered : “I
shall be very pleased to play with you. I
think I am qualified—l shall be 80 years of
age next birthday.”
EL V. Thorby, M.L.A., the new president
of the N.S.W. Farmers and Settlers’ Asso-
ciation, ought to know something of his job,
as he was farming on his own account at the
age of 15. Wammerawa gave him one of its
seats on the Progressive ticket at the last
general election.
Mrs. Ellen Ross, credited with being the
first white woman to land in Townsville
(Q.), died the other day. She arrived in
the Burdekin district in 1863, and had en-
joyed the deadly climate of the North ever
since.
“Q. Land”: Justice Lukin (Q.) has a
long memory. A woman appeared before
him in a divorce case the other day. “Let
me see,” he said; “didn’t you consult me
about a separation in 1902 with Mr. Fox,
solicitor, a fortnight after you were married ?”
The lady admitted that she had. “Then T
can’t hear the case,” said Lukin; “I have
appeared as counsel in the same matter.”
And it had to go to another Judge.
“Bismuth”: Baron von Eckhardstein, once
Counsellor of the German Embassy in Lori-
don, who lately published “Ten Years at
the Court of St. James,” was the first hus-
band of Lady Weigall, wife of a recent Gov-
ernor of S. Aus. She divorced the baron
in 1908, and his allusion to the affair in his
book is as tactful as a sensitive lady could
wish. She, by the way, was the only child
of Sir John Blundell-Maple, the owner of
the large furniture shop in Tottenham Court-
road, who died leaving over a million for
the lady to play with. He was a sporty old
chap, sardonically known to half-wits as
“Chairs and Tables”; but he never made a
MICK KIRWAN. Chairman of Committees

secret of the fact that his baronetcy came
to him in the ordinary way of political com-
merce. There is a tale to the effect that, on
the receipt of his title, he worried. Sir Arthur
Scott-Gatty, Garter King-at-Arms, for a nice
motto and crest, and the latter, meeting a
popular litterateur, asked his advice. The
scribe thought for a moment and then said:
“What about a sofa rampant over the motto
‘T.P. or not T.P.’ ”
The “million miles o’ sea” record of Kip-
ling’s McAndrew has been beaten in Austra-
lian waters by A. W. Allen, chief steward of
Mcllwraith-McEacharn’s Ivatoomba, who has
crossed the Bight 510 times and left
McAndrew’s figures a quarter of a million
miles behind. He started carrying crockery
30 years ago in the old Tagliaferro, which
the firm bought from Italian owners and
sold back to them, presumably because pas-
sengers caused the stewards too much work
trying to pronounce her.
“Gallery”: Frank Groves, member for
Dandenong in the Vic. Assembly, who is
said to have a chance for an Hon. Minis-
tership if Lawson reconstructs his Cabinet,
is a plumber and ex-Mayor of Carrum, the
week-end resort where the rumors come from.
He Is now sec. of the country Liberals, and
when A. A. Billson was ill he understudied
him as Acting-Chair-man of Committees.
Groves, who isn’t exactly a Hackenschmidt,
is called “The Bud,” though whether in allu-
sion to his countenance or to his political
immaturity the present writer knoweth not.
C. 11. Dewhirst, permanent head of the
Works Department, steps.into the vacancy
on the S.A. Tram Trust caused by the death
of Thomas Gill. The Government rep. is a
son of an old school-inspector, was a cham-
pion cyclist in the “bone-shaker” days, and is
now a crack yachtsman. In 1914 he suc-
ceeded in the Works Dept. J. W. Jones, whom
a rugged political chief once summed up as
“Excellent officer, but too blanky politeful
for me.” Thereafter he was known as “B. P.
Jones,” till a new-comer so addressed a heavy
document to him —and then the seismographs
registered a large-sized earthquake.
“Schnorrer”: Early in August a new Jew-
ish minister, S. Mestel, came to Australia to
take charge of the East Melbourne congre-
gation. In a few weeks Rabbi Brodie (who
waited in England to receive his Rabbinical
diploma) will arrive. With L. A. Falk, now
in Sydney, this makes an addition of three
ministers, all young and all enthusiastic
Zionists, to look after the religious needs of
the Chosen. But most of the others are old,
or getting old. Dr. Abrahams, of Melbourne
(one of the finest Talmudists in the world),
has retired, his Rabbinical activities being
purely voluntary now; and S. M. Solomon
has been ministering for 40 years in the
southern city. In Sydney Rabbi Cohen is
still comparatively young; but Phillipstein
and Wolinski are practically on the pension-
list.
THE GREAT UNWASHED.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
attnSwi Yi ICaS i Agent-General for South Aus.,
mended the ltoyal Sanitary Association’s Conference
at Hull and pointed out the almost complete absence
of shower-baths in England.”
When knighthood really was in flower
And Britain at her prime,
The Englishman, with much contempt
For cleanliness, made no attempt
To mitigate his grime;
The Knights Companions of the Bath
Unwashed kept on their stainless path.
When Wellington achieved renown,
And pulled Old England through,
Although his troops looked smart and spruce,
The gallant fellows didn’t use
Much soap at Waterloo ;
The bravest from ablutions shrank ;
And thus attained a higher rank.
And J. Bull’s glory still shall be
Effulgent as of yore,
Though every Briton, scorning germs,
Contemptuously the bath affirms
A hygienic bore ;
He’ll still be strong when dangers lower
While he eschews the morning shower.

THE BOY: “Take an’ ’old yourself — l’m no Bolshie!”
“H.E.R.”: “Pat Bushie’s” swaggie (B.
26/7/’23) who said a place was “out where the wind
starts,” reminds me of the windy Darling Range in
Westralia’s sou’-west. One morning some passengers
boarded the first train into the city, and were dis-
cussing the abnormal night zephyrs of the locality.
“Get out!” bleated an old bloke from further back.
“Wot do yous chaps know about wind? Tons only

Kelmscott, an’ then flies orl over the country in bits. ’

“Monaro”: If these Abo.-liars don’t knock
off writing about record weight-carrying lunacies
someone will be getting run in for manslaughter. I’ll
bet that on the Sunday after “Rupanyup’s” par. (B.
26/7/’23) appeared, in every wheat district in three
States some misguided ass was seeing what he could
do with “three bags of wheat tied together.” I
have labored in all the States of Australia, and have
never yet been in a place that didn’t have its quota
of pain-stricken men wrecked as a result of fool
wagers like “Rupanyup’s.” “Didn’t know his own
strength,” was the stereotyped remark applied to all.
I have seen a 3ewt. anvil carried around a bicycle-
track for a £2 bet. Three days later we paid £2
a head to bury the poor devil. He was lucky. I
know a man of 48 who 32 years ago won a grown-up
caber-tossing competition at Shepparton (Vic.), and
has never had a well 24 hours since. Some years
back a N.S.W. South Coast man, in suitable harness,
lifted Bcwt. clear of the ground. Eight months later
death released him from misery.
“Police Patrol”: “Ragar” (B. 5/7/’23)
asks if anyone has seen a snake drink. Yes. In my
younger days we coaxed one from under our house
at Beechworth (Vic.) with a saucer of hot milk, and
he commenced his jamboree by drinking in the
manner of a horse, pausing every few seconds to take
breath or congratulate himself on his buckshee ban-
quet. His capacity was about half a cup, and he
cleaned his jaws with his tongue like a cat does.
Just then a gun exploded, and off he went on his
long journey. I have also seen other snakes drink —
have drunk with them, in fact, and been their guests,
sung and danced and thrown dice with ’em. But I
was never quite so clear as'to how they drank as in
the case of that first wriggling tippler at Beechworth.
“Jimmy Possum”: The description of the
paddy-melon given by “Pick” and “Nor’-West” (B.
5/7/’23) agrees in most respects with that of the
animal we know as the paddy-melon up here (C.Q.).
But no one seems to have mentioned a couple of
very marked features —Paddy’s paws are proportion-
ally longer than those of any other of the hopping
brigade, and his fur is softer and rather longer than
a wallaby’s, seeming to be a cross between that of
a wallaby and a ’possum’s. The flesh has also a
stronger smell than that of the larger scrub hoppers.
As for kangaroo-rats, we have two varieties here.
One is a small, brown chap with a long blackish tail,
the other a large, handsome, bluish-grey animal, bad-
tempered and quarrelsome. When alarmed he bounds
away with a hissing call, that sounds like the letting
off of short blasts of steam. Both kinds make grass
nests, and both are expert sweet-potato thieves. The
black-tailed specimen is rather rare.

“Cobug” : Four of u§ were timber-getting
away back of Warburton (Vic.) when Bill struck
a bad cold and decided to lay off for the day! We
three moved up the hill, directly above the hut, and
soon had a sft. stringy on the go. Just as it was
falling a heavy gust took the giant and twisted it
broadside on, and away it careered straight for the
hut- —-and Bill. Horror-stricken we watched it bump
the hut and a heavily-laden tram to glory. We
looked,at one another too full to speak. Then Bill’s
face appeared out of the debris, and out pf the tace
there came: “Can’t yous blankety blanks let a
blanky man sleep ?”
* * * *
“Curlew”: Let not any Abo., seeing
“Cobug’s” (B. 26/7/’23) recipe for the extermination
of nut-grass, be led into lightly securing aii area of
it for farming purposes. A very up-to-date China-
man near me had 20 acres infested with the night-
mare. : He did his ploughing with a double-furrow
disc and had up-to-
date cultivating mach-
inery. His method for
some years was to
give two good plough-
ings and cultivation
and then race his crops
(mostly beans and
tomatoes) , against the
rut-grass. He had vary-
ing success, but the
nut-grass always ran
a good second. Once
when it was too dry
to plant for many
montiis, he ploughed
and reploughed his
ground no less than
12 times, and finally
when the rain came
planted it. The nut-
grass beat all previous
records that year, and
Johnny left for fresh
fields. Isn’t “Cobug”
confusing nut- with
blady-grass? P.S.—My
recipe for extermi-
nating nut-grass is to
put all the soil to the
depth of a foot through
a fine sieve and pick out
the nuts—then put in
an application for the old-age pension. P.P.S.—
Only very young men are advised 'to tackle this
method.

“V.J.C.”: I nominate Lea Wintle, L of
Yerranderie (N.S.W.), as the champion sound sleeper.
He fell asleep while reading in his tent one night,
and woke with the sun shining on his face and only
the tent-poles above him. The tent had been burnt
off him during the night.
“Paul C.”: Yes, bullocks can be steered
without blasphemy, or theological or any other kind of
language all right (B. 19/7/’23). I knew a bullocky
who had a well and truly earned reputation for
being the champion mill-log stealer. He’d ride
through private property, not too far from the mill,
spy out good logs, chop a load down in the stilly
night, raise a couple of panels of fence with his
lifting-jack, hitch his oxen on to the fallen logs,
and, no matter how dark the night, he could success-
fully steer that team through the timber. Even
when the spare-chained log was a big one, and
when crossing short gullies the thick end would
sometimes get partly buried in the bank, the only
sound emitted by the driver was a sharp “Sto! sh!
sh!” —and that team would either haul the log
clear or pull the gully with it.
DAD MOVES AN AMENDMENT.
DAD: “I don't want any, I tell yer. So clear out!”
YANKEE BOOK-AGENT : “I guess I can stay till I get your order.
Patient is my middle name.”
DAD: “And yer front name will be Horspital if yer don’t get a
move on yer.”
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: The Adelaide abattoirs
are not the only place where astonishing exhibits
from the entrails of bullocks are found (B. 28/6/’23).
While working at Vestys’ meatworks in Parap (N.T.)
I found in the paunches various articles ranging
from small stone spearheads to a telegraph-post insu-
lator. In one healthy-looking bullock I came upon
an iron spearhead about tin. long. How it got
into the beast is a mystery to me, but one theory
was that a native had speared the bullock, and the
head had become detached and worked its way into
the paunch. “B.’s” theory that cattle swallow
stones when drinking or licking is not a safe bet,
as. he says. I’ve seen cattle “chewing” large stones
and bones, and the fact that they often accidentally
go down seems to point to the solution of the.
mystery.

“Boalderite”: Heard of the old chap at
Condobolin (N.S.W.) who, while hunting on the
Lachlan, badly peeled his nose with a pea-rifle bul-
let ? He had the cartridges in his pocket, which also
contained his pipe and tobacco, and having rolled
up a “fill” he lit up and—went home minus a good
portion of his proboscis. He swears that someone
tried to shoot him, but there’s no doubt he loaded
a cartridge into his pipe, and the match did the rest.
IN THE LAND O’ LOTS O’ TIME.
DOCTOR: “Quick, sonny! Which is the
way to Wallygunyah?”
SONNY: “Foller the mob of sheep in front
of yer and yer can’t miss it — they’re
goin’ there.”
“Chanticleer”: As an immoral force the
horse is merely entering the straight when the nen
is home and dried; and the fish as a provoker of
tall tales can’t compare with her. The way breeders
and dealers of the hen lie and swindle would make
an old horse-dealer lie
down and cry. The lies
told about her laying, her
pedigree and her strain
suggest that Ananias and
Sapphira learned their
business while they culti-
vated Plymouth Rocks and
Rhode Islands. But it’s
when she enters the show-
pen that her potentialities
for evil reach the peak.
The allegations of faking,
corruption, bribery, swind-
ling, fraud, collusion and
theft that make up the
atmosphere of any ordi-
nary hen-show would put a
P.L.L. conference up the
pole in once. Yet to the
person with a bent foi
natural science she is a
gold-mine. Spend weeks
growing a chrysanthemum
the size of a cabbage, and
the results yield neither a
joint nor an omelette.
Spend your time on the
humble hen, and you can
produce a 41b. bird that
will lay 371 b. of eggs in 12
months. You can build
her and her progeny up
till chickens are commoner
than chump-chops in your
larder. If you have a
genius for biology you can
produce hens and roosters
that for size and type and
color and feathering make
your neighbor’s wife’s dia-
monds look like glass. Any
rich “dope” can buy dia-
monds ; only a genius can
produce the black-red-
barred-spangled-laced-blue-
black-brownriwhite Leg-
horn-shan. And, incident-
ally, nature may permit
you a glimpse at the work-
ing of the laws governing
inheritance while you do it.

“Chiron”: And tell “R.S.” (B. 12/7/”23)
that it wasn’t R. Stevenson who intr : |/iped the
kookaburra to the Speck, either. H. N. Symmons
did that nearly 50 years ago, when he brought a
mixed foursome from Vic. If “R.S.” is still an
unbeliever, let him ask W. Guest, at the Oaks,
Longford.
* * * *
“Larry Longun”: Inform “Kowrah” (B.
28/6/’23) that the sugar needn’t be brown to tell
when it’s going to rain. White sugar, salt, and even
tobacco, indicate faithfully the changes in the
weather. All three become very hard when it’s dry
and sticky and moist when rain hangs near. Even
an old accordion makes a good barometer, the bel-
lows working stiffly when rain is brooding. But my
best weather-prophet is my hair—what’s left of it.
When it’s going to rain my thatch twists and curls in
the most coquettish fashion, exposing unmercifully
my growing baldness, which ordinarily I am still
able to camouflage. It knocks spots off rheumatism,
which, while it indicates changes of weather faith-
fully enough, often makes a liar of itself when it
comes to predicting rain. That’s been my experience,
anyway.

“Wanterkno”: About the handiest way to
tie a horse up is to make him think he is when he
isn’t; but can anyone in the Council give the tip as
to how to go about it with a view to the prad stand-
ing with the reins hanging to the ground?

More about Bunny’s private affairs: —
“Cooralco”: Re “Warrumbucea’s” inquiry (B.
19/7/’23) as to whether young rabbits die in the bur-
rows or conception is delayed in drought time. I think
the latter is far more probable,' as it occurs in a
number of other animals. In Europe, most of the
. bats mate in September, but pregnancy does not
start till the winter is past—April or May. With
nlany deer also there is a tremendous delay in the
start of development. It .also occurs in the kangaroo,
as the following case will show'. A male and female
red kangaroo were kept in an enclosure, and in
November a young one was born. Three months
later the male died. The young one left the pouch
for the first time on June 1, but on July 3 it was
not allowed by the female to enter the pouch again,
and on the next day another young one was found
adhering to the teat. The hirth thus occurred
five months after the death of the male —and
the gestation period of the kangaroo is only 32
days. The only alternatives to explain this are:
Cl) That the first joey was responsible, which is
absurd; and (2) that conception had been delayed.
And so it seems that with the kangaroos mating
goes on at all times, but there is a possibility that
commencement of development of the embryo may
depend on favorable external conditions as obtain
ip a good season.
“Paul C.” : The young rabbits do not die in the
burrows in drought time. The plain fact is that
Mr. Rabbit, in a bad time, is too busy all night and
nearly all day searching for stray scraps to keep
himself alive, to have any time left for love making:
and even if he had, his missus, who_ would be as
lean and hungry as himself, would rebuke him
immediately. Then, when years of plenty arrive,
and Mr. Rabbit waxes fat and frisky, his fancy
lightlv turns to thoughts of love, and his offspring
soon becomes like unto the sands of the seashore.

THE PILFERERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Who robs one of a watch and chain
Is seeking Luck’s romances,
Which yield their pleasure or their pain,
Successes or mischances ;
With hopes of getting clean away
At golden lure he snatches —
Good luck to speculation gay !
But who’s a decent word to say
For those who sneak the matches?
To me all burglars of the banks
Are fellow-men, though awful.
I curse them not; their action ranks
As honestly unlawful;
Quick wealth their aim, they play the game,
They laugh at locks and latches,
And revel in their cheap ill-fame.
But what about the prig who came
Just now and shook my matches?
When I have money in my purse
The crafty pocket-picker
Is, in his godless way, no worse
Than he who took my ticker ;
’Midst crowds the bird pursues his quest
Who, when a “rozzer” catches,
For cheerless cage must quit his nest.
Yet no one puts beneath arrest
The thief who takes your matches!
Who robs you of your peace of mind
Is oft a fair offender;
A kindred theft you had designed,
Despite her sex (or gender).
The biter now and then is bit,
And mischief fresh he hatches,
But hopelessly a man must sit
And suck his lonely pipe unlit,
If Johnson took the matches.
He took his leave, and took the box,
This friend of law and order;
No expert he at picking locks,
No boldly bad marauder;
But he, and others like him, prey
On any bloke who “batches”;
They take him down when cards they play,
They drink his whisky, and away—
And with them go the matches.

Bouragi”; A. C. Findlay, who is in
charge of the first stage of the British Scientific Ex-
ploration part}' which intends to cross Papua east
of the Dutch border, arrived in Sydney from Papua
a few days ago. He has been making inquiries as to
transport facilities, and is now on his way back to
England to report. Findlay has told interviewers that
he is satisfied that carrier transport and provisioning
for the large party can be easily managed. One
wonders whether the three or four months spent in
Papua have helped him to realise the job ahead of
him. The great obstacle to Papuan exploration has
been the extraordinary variations in the manners
and customs of the population, in the food supply
and in the nature of the country. As an ex-resident
magistrate who had a small share in opening up new
Papuan country, I can confidently assert that the
man who estimates the conditions of his next expedi-
tion by the one he has just completed is likely to
fall in badly. The ascent of one great mountain
range may be through dripping, moss-covered forests,
by difficult and almost unscaleable crags. All the
way from the swamps or the plains there may be
no food-supply and no native population whatever.
The next Venture may be up unsuspected paths,
through populous mountain villages with rich gardens,
and past lakes teeming with wild life. The flat
country may be anything from arid, knife-edged
limestone country to stinking and impenetrable sago
swamps. The "foothills may be rolling, waterless
grass slopes or almost perpendicular ridges, with
rushing mountain torrents dividing their towering
sides. In one trip brown brother may be affable
and willing to help with food and labor. In another
he will be truculent and murderously inclined. Every
Papuan explorer of real repute, including Sir William
Macgvegor, has worked with small parties ; Le Hunte
and Monckton set a fleeting fashion for big proces-
sions, armed to the teeth, but these did little more
than furnish material for long-written reports.
Papua, as a whole, is a most unreliable area for a
large expedition; there is rarely anything in the way
of local food-supply to which a large party can turn
for subsistence.

shifting camp. So numerous were the ’roos that,
if records were wanted, one gun could have accounted
for 100 in a day. Returning after the wet season
in April the following year, the shooters’ bag to
November totalled 6000. In 1913, a couple of
months at Aberfoyle station, on Torrens Creek, pro-
duced 1400. Then, shifting over to Lake Gallilee
during the same year, the treasury was fattened by
an additional 500. Thus in well under three years
their aggregate was 16,400 ’roos, besides consider-
able variegated and lesser game. Incidentally,
“Rattler” was the only man I have known who could
remove a new-born joey from the original teat to
another without breaking the membrane of the deli-
cate mouth.

“Hob”: Anent “Sarah Anne’s” remarks
(B. 26/7/’23) on the sliming operation performed
by a carpet-snake before swallowing his prey. I
came across a 6f» carpet peacefully coiled up among
some grass, alongside a waterhole, near Barcaldine
(Q.), and in hunting for his head found a fair-sized
teal with one wing in the snake’s mouth and so
extending it as to make the two jaws almost form
a straight line. The Joe Blake was not very worried
about my presence, and after having received a few
prods with a stick he slid off lazily into the water
and swam away, leaving his dinner on the bank.
The teal was quite warm, and the wing and surround-
ing parts were covered with a thick slime —it looked
as though the snake had used hair-oil liberally on
the parts. Judging by comparative sizes it was
puzzling how the reptile was going to accommodate
the duck; and I began to wonder if the slime acted
as a predigestive agent.
“T.V.T.”: I hasten to inform “Quang”
(B. 2/8/’23) that vegetarianism is no new cult among
foxes. A few years ago, when I was on the land at
Kooweerup (Vic.), I used to try to keep the mortgagee
at bay by growing Yorkshire peas for the market. I
was greatly puzzled on finding the young green pods
chewed and eaten by some marauder, whose identity
was a mystery until early one morning I discovered
Brer Fox in the act. Still, I would not swear posi-
tively that this particular Reynard was wholly a
vegetarian, for Dalmore station was just alongside
my holding, and he may have been taking lamb with
his green peas.

(the degree was obtained for never as much as
breaking a horn in hauling timber from scrubby
slopes in Bananaland and Noo South for nine years),
I met a few men who did not, at least openly, swear,
but whose “Blooming brutes!” was uttered with
more vindictiveness and malice than the lurid adjec-
tives of the ordinary driver who relieved his internal
volcanic pressure through the “blanky blankard”
escape-valve. Further, the latter in my experience,
was always the more humane. Since “T.V.T.’s”
mute conductor can’t speak, does he convey his desires
per. medium of the whip—which would cause the
beasts more torture than language would —or does
he issue his instructions in Braille?
“Centre”: Have I discovered a prehis-
toric grub? Equipped with 46 legs, in two lots, the
hind group numbering 36
and the front 10, it meas-
ures liin. long, is dark
brown all over, and has
a head exactly like an
ant. The rear portion of
the body is covered with
brown, fluff-like, wool, as
is also the head, while
the portion round and
about the 10 legs is bare.
I found it in the heart
of a block of yellow sand-
stone, at the end of a 9in.
burrow exactly its own
girth. The stone was un-
marked and unstained for
Tin. of the 9in., but round
the grub it was pure
white. In the same block
were other burrows, gen-
erally shorter than the
one in which the grub
was found, but containing
nothing, as far as I saw.
As I say, have I blun-
dered on something that
wriggled on this earth a
million years or so ago?
“FY7” : “Blanc” (B. 26/7/’23) must have
been new to West-Queensland ways when he tried to
maltreat a green frog. The big white-waistcoated
gentleman is a great houselover and highly intelligent
for his kind. He can easily be taught to come for
food, is a pet with most bush children, and is a
mighty devourer of cockroaches. One, a friend of
mine, used to live in a “pull-up” shower bucket, and
if you caught a cockroach and tapped on the sus-
pending rope Peter would come down, hand over
hand, for the delicacy. Like one of those mentioned
by “Blanc,” boiling water was the end of Peter. He
got his issue by changing his sleeping quarters to a
shaving-water jug without giving the statutory
notice.
“Fang-aloli”: Re “Rupanyup’s” instance
of a man carrying three bags of wheat at once (B.
26;'7/’23). Colin Ross, storekeeper and miller at
Inverell (N.S.W.), in the early ’seventies, sold a
bag of flour (2001 b.) to a woman who lived about
100yds. away from the store on the other side of
the street. When Ross said he could not deliver
it at her house for some hours, the lady remarked
that she’d carry it home herself. “I don’t think
you can,” opined Ross. “Why,” she retorted, “I
could carry two!” “Try it,” said Ross facetiously,
“and if you do, I’ll make you a present of ’em.”
The woman had the bags put one on each hip, then,
TRUE APPRECIATION.
THE PARSON: “I have missed you from our Sunday-evening services
lately. I hope you don't find my sermons too long."
THE FLAPPER: “Oh, no! Mother insists on us being home directly
church is out, and — oh, you can't make your sermons too
long for us."
holding each with an arm, triumphantly marched
home with the lot. Now, as to “Kenbir’s” nigger
who carried 1401 b. 25 miles. In Fiji a slim-built
Indian coolie working on my plantation brought a
bag of sharps weighing 1601 b. six miles over a
hilly road from the shop to his hut —carried it on
his head all the way—in about two hours. “K.’s”
Binghi carried 201 b. less, and though he humped
his burden 25 miles he took a whole day to do it.
* * * *
“W.D.G.”: If “Picko” (B. 5/7/’23) had
struclf me in 1913 I could have given him a feed of
biltong—or that is what I intended it to be. I used
to cut a couple of legs of mutton in thin strips and
hang them on a wire in the sun. In less than a
week they were dry and hard, and would keep for
months. Soaked and stewed with spuds and onions
the stuff made a fair feed.
* * * *
“Kenber” ; Tell “A. de L.” (B. 2/8/’23) that
the Kendall expedition has four of his “beautiful
little fur-adorned creatures,” which are a kind of
rock-wallaby and live in the ranges south-west of the
Gulf. I can support him in his statement that they
have not yet been described by zoologists. Providing
the specimens live, Kendall will be the first to exhibit
them in the South. But he didn’t discover one
adorned with all the colors “A. de L.” mentions
(black, yellowish and whitey-grey),' and if “A. de
L.” happens on another he’ll be able to make a deal.
* * * *
“F. Clinton”: The old belief that ophthal-
mia in sheep and cattle can be cured by treating the
eyes with powdered glass or alum dies slowly. Many
men of more than average intelligence still cling to
it, and the stock branch of the N.S.W. Department of
Agriculture is constantly running up against them.
Apart from the damnable cruelty of the treatment,
it is utterly futile. To place powdered glass or any
finely granulated substance in the eye not only irri-
tates the nerves, but destroys the tissues and blinds
the sufferer. The fools who employ this devilment
on animals would not dream of treating themselves
in like manner, although they almost deserve it as a
punishment for their cruelty.
* * « *
“Saaedi” : Abo.-ites, in discussing the vir-
tues of the ibis recently, forgot to mention the
splendid work done by this bird as a destroyer of
grasshoppers. When a ’hopper plague threatens us
here (Central West N.S.W.), almost invariably the
ibis arrives in multitudes, and quickly reduces the
invading host to reasonable proportions. These
very valuable birds are great communists, and
when concentrating on any particular spot they travel
in very large numbers, generally flying in V forma-
tion. Considering the stack of evidence tendered
in the Abo. columns recently as to the various
virtues of the ibis, it seems probable that long-
legs should perch somewhere near the top of the
tree in rural regard.
“Bill Bowyang”: “Ringer” (B. 26/7/’23)
will find it difficult to get the names of the original
members of the “Ragged Thirteen.” Roaming round
the roof of Bananaland for the past three years I’ve
interviewed scores of
old bushmen, but those
who did know any-
thing about the ragged
cattle-duffers preserved
a discreet silence when
the subject was men-
tioned. It is quite on
the cards that at
times I was talking to
one of the gang or his
family, as some of the
Thirteen afterwards
settled down in the
Cloncurry district. So
far as I have been able
to ascertain, the Thir-
teen started to work
their way from C.Q.
to Kimberley (W.A.)
about 40 years back.
Most of the gang went
under aliases, and the
leader was known as
the Queensland Orphan.
The gang disbanded
after passing the Ban-
analand border, and -he
Orphan settled near a
station at the bottom
of the Gulf, where he
built yards, erected a
shanty and helped him-
self to cattle from the
..djoining stations.
These he sold in a
butcher’s shop along-
side the shanty;
but the squatters event-
ually made things so
warm for him that he
fled south. Another well-
known member of the
gang was Paddy ’.he
Priest, who afterwards
became a notorious
cattle-dnffer on the
Queensland border. He
died near Burketown
25 years back. It can
be put down to the
credit of the Thirteen
that they never robbed
a poor man, and often
supplied horses to weary
travellers.
“A.E.H.”: “Centurion” (B. 26/7/’23)
says that in the preparation of biltong the meat
must be dipped in boiling fat, and sun-dried. An
Australian who spent 15 years in S’Africa says
the dipping is never done, and the drying is by the
wind in a shady place. Incidentally, this is what
W. T. Hornsday, hunter in the Canadian Rockies, has
to say on the subject, and it should be useful to
anyone who wants to try the idea: —
From the very first I began to dry wild meat, after
a fashion I had learned from my old friend L. A.
Huffman. The process is so simple a child can
use it, and the ingredients purchased anywhere. The
proportions of the mixture I use are: Salt, 31b.;
allspice, four tablespoonfuls; and black pepper, five
tablespoonfuls, all thoroughly mixed. Take a ham
of deer, elk, mountain-sheep or goat, and as soon
as possible after killing dissect the thigh muscle
by muscle. Anyone can learn to do this by follow-
ing up with the knife the natural divisions between
the muscles. A piece of meat should not exceed
oin. in thickness. Skin off all enveloping mem-
branes, so that the curative powder will come in
direct contact with the raw, moist flesh. The be? -
size for pieces of meat to be cured by this process
is not over a foot long, 6 or -8i inches wide and
4in. thick. When each piece has been prepared, rub
the powder upon every part of the surface, and let
the mixture adhere as much as it will. Then hang
up each piece of meat by a string through a hole
made in the smaller end, and let it dry in the
wind. If the sun is hot, lceep.the meat in the shade.
Never let the meat get wet. If the weather is
A TERRIBLE COUNTRY THIS!

rainy for a lone: period, hang your meat-rack where
it will get mild heat from the camp fire, but no
smoke that is unavoidable, and cover it at night
with a piece of canvas. Meat thus prepared is not
at its best for eating until it is about two months
old; then slice it thin. After that no sportsman or
hunter or trapper can get enough of it.

Where the Yarra Yarra sweeps
Singing down between the mountains,
All the wealth of August leaps
From the earth in golden fountains.
While they hang upon the air
For that brief, enchanted season
You must call a truce with care—
Thought is folly, grief is treason.
For too soon they break and wane
And the dying glories pass
In a drift of scented rain
Falling softly on the grass.

_why Dunlop “Cords ”
are built with a larger air space!
Experience and tests on Australian roads have demonstrated that better
wearing results and more comfort follow the use of tyres with extra air
space—hence, our decision to embody this advantage in our Dunlop Cords.
It means extra materials and extra cost in manufacture, yet we are able to list

—the highest grade tyre it is possible to make-at a figure considerably
below that charged for standard sized lighter weight imported tyres.
The illustration will convey an idea of the extra materials incorporated
in Dunlop Cords. The result is a particularly fine tyre of outstanding value
and economy. These covers are made in Australia to withstand the roughest
of Australian road conditions and can be fitted with every confidence of their
standing up to the hardest driving—and obtaining satisfactory service, at
a wonderfully low figure. Obtain a list and compare prices. Your

Judging by the national sets at the Allied
Nations Ball, the Great War was won by
Ancient Greece and Rome and 17th-century
Venice, with a dash of old Holland. France,
Belgium and Britain with conspicuous
modesty remained absent. But secretaries
Mrs. Geoffrey Fairfax and Mrs. Pfeiffer
didn’t mind, as before the dance kicked off
their objective of £lOOO had been reached,
largely owing to the generosity of Mrs. Mac-
lurcan, who as chatelaine of the Wentworth
handed over both ballroom and larder for the
Good Cause, which was the Royal Hospital
for Women. By the way, the Stork seems to
have passed the stage where he was looked
upon as Merely Respectable. He is now a
Social Success. He perched with his usual
burden amid the pink carnations and festive
vegetation on the vice-regal table. Here sat
Dame Margaret in ivory brocades that sup-
ported floating accessories of silver tulle.
With her were Miss Englehart and Miss
Henderson. The Dutch set deserved an
extra splash of gin in its fruit-cup: Mrs.
Wallace, of Bowral, was responsible for it.
The 17th-century Venetian set, which looked
exactly like a Beaucaire wardrobe, pulled
down the prize for originality, at which the
wife of Italian Consul Vitali wore a pleased
smile. Tall Tootles Williamson flashed a
beautiful shawl as a dashing Spanish seno-
rita; and little Mrs. Pfeiffer’s gorgeous
Chinese costume might have been worn by
some Manchu lady of high degree. Audrey
Stanton’s “Black Cat” costume brought her
the luck of a prize, Dr. McKelvey came with
his good-looking lady, and the Pat Levy
couple were among the night’s tireless step-
pers. A Waley girl was one of the most
striking dressers; her frock was built of one
of the new tight little bodices in tangerine
velvet above a spreading, down-to-the-ground
skirt of apricot hue.
The civic dignity of the Town Hall fled
before hordes of scintillating yellow and
golden-brown butterflies that flew giddily
about its interior last week. Under their
champagne influence the dear old thing
hurriedly disguised herself as an Arcadian
grove—or was it the Primrose Path? Any-
way, the camouflage was good enough to
attract hundreds of dancers for the benefit
of the Ryde Home for Incurables. The
clever and sympathetic hands of Fred Searl
were responsible for the souffle of lights
shaded to a radiant mist, the trails of
yellow blossom trained into arbor-like erup-
tions, the slender ropes of greenery mooring
lights to gallery pillars, and the central
golden-brown butterfly, the size of a small
aeroplane, that seemed directing the flight
of the younger fry, even as Mrs. Bertie
Kelly, in the pink petties and the poke
bonnet of petulant Mary Quite Contrary,
was doing on the floor beneath, while pretty
young things disguised as a horticultural
shqw danced a floral cotillion for the bene-
fit of Dame Margaret. She had left sick
Sir Walter at home, and ruffled out in
powder-blue brocade and jewelled laces, em-
bellished further with a presentation butter-
fly bouquet.
Of the bouquet of feminine charm the
tulip lasses were the most fetching;
to a girl they owned a satisfying slim
length of limb. But the arum-lilies, with
their towering headgear suggestive of the
snow-capped peaks of Mount Everest, dis-
played junoesque curves, and the first prize
fell into their pure white calyx. Iceland
poppies, waratabs and wistaria were other
entries in this Spring Flower Show. A
rosebud garland of girls frolicked under
Mrs. Halloran’s rosy petals, and the same
lady directed the stampede of mannequins
that stepped from the covers of the Adver-
tising Catalogue arranged on a gold and
black stage. Of other clothes-supporters
the most striking were Argie Mitchell and
Mamie Giljfees, of Vauchise. Mamie charmed
the eye in a model of!; amethyst sequins,
with which she carried a large blue fan.
The faithful Cullen dame, in mouse-grey
trappings, and'Miss Henderson, in glittering
black, supported the Vice-Reine ; and others
who adorned the dais were Mayoress Gil-
pin, who struck a subdued note in grey
georgettes; Mrs. Fred Searl, in blue velvet
with a moonlight bloom in its folds; and
Mrs. Herbert Field, who carried her silver-
tissue frocking beneath a wonderful coat
of ivory and silver.
The graduates of Duntroon and their
wives at present in Sydney have been making
the welkin ring with gaieties. The Dun(roon
Graduates’ Association has been handing out
the buttered toast, with Mrs. Austin Chap-
man as hostess. The Palais Royal housed
their doings one night, when their supper-
tables blazed with blue and red decorations
(the College colors), and every lad and lass
hoisted a jazz cap half-red and half-blue.
The Attorney-General Bavin couple’s
party during the week-end was of the sober-
investment variety. Everybody present
looked as though his income was derived
from Government bonds, and hadn’t the
slightest relationship with filthy lucre that
accrues from business lotteries or racing
speculations. It was fittingly staged on the
thick carpets of the decorous Queen’s Club ;
and Judges and Professors and Bishops
rioted as wildly as long-wooled sheep. The
decorations were lupins and great bowls of
Iceland poppies and Mrs. Bavin’s classical
drapings of daffodil yellow.
Mrs. Kelso King and Mrs. Venour Nathan
have been working at high pressure over the
Navy League matinee on August 28 at the
Royal. Receipts will go to the fund for
assisting boys to a sea training, particularly
the sons of sailors and soldiers who fell in
the Great War. Mrs. Yenour, who is a
remarkable dancer herself, promises a per-
fect eye-opener with two society flappers on
the songandance bill. Professionals who
will put a curl into the afternoon are Lady
Forbes Robertson, Lee White and the irre-
pressible Percy. Jack Cannot is going to
be serious for once; he and Mrs. Alex. Gor-
don are rehearsing together. Tickets range
from fl Is. to 55., and the plan is at Paling’s.
Spring is at hand. The corporation man
is splashing the pavements with festive tar;
from the garden over the way comes the gay
music of creaking instruments just as you
turn over for the last 40 winks; outside grey
rain patters incessantly; and the “fete” is
raising its head in the land. As the blonde
daffodil, it came up smiling the other day at
St. James’s when the Cullen lady murmured
the opening incantation over an array of
goods, wise and otherwise, displayed by the
members of the Linen Auxiliary of the
Crown-street Women’s Hospital. Judging
by the attendance and the well-stocked stalls,
the 160 new beds that the institution is in-
stalling will be as snow-clad as their neigh-
bors. The hospital’s secretary, Mona Daley,
who made her first public appearance since
her accident, got an ovation equal to a movie
star’s.
The memory of Ada Partridge is kept
green by the pupils of Fort-steet. They have
founded a prize-fund named after her who
was mistress of the Girls’ High for nearly 20
years, and it is helped annually by the Old
Fortians’ dance. The flutter for refilling the
treasury took place last week at the Padding-
ton Town Hall, made cheery for the occasion
with a scheme of decoration in the school’s
red and white.
Here’s the latest Freeman picture of State-
Governor Davidson’s daughters, Diana and
Daphne. Australia has provided a liberal
education for the girls, who have been gaily
present at all
sorts of func-
tions, from
Junior Red
Cross rallies
and the open-
ing of Parlia-
ments to big
A.J.C. meet-
i n g s. That
they are tak-
ing away some
“dinkum Aus-
tralian” qual-
ity was evi-
denced last
week by
Diana, who in
her class
sports took a
fl yi n g jump
3ft. llin. high.
These sports,
wh i c,h were
held in the
grounds of Government House, had for their
competitors mostly the kiddies who are being
taught eurhythmies and a few etceteras in
the Justice Gordon schoolroom. A few other
entrants were scratched up among the neigh-
bors, until quite an important-looking pro-
gramme was got together.
Pianist Leslie Nilsson, who is billed to
leave for Europe soon, gave a farewell re-
cital at Paling’s concert-hall on Friday. The
young man’s poetic feeling was particularly
noticeable in the Chopin group. With some
months of hard work abroad his craft will
probably equal his temperament, and then
Sydney will add still another to her fine
musicians. His wife, Arline Cross, singer
Cacialli and violinist Warwick McKenzie,
with the incomparable Vern Barnett as
accompanist, supported the pianist.
Near one of the city’s surging arteries
stands the grey house of peace known as the
Hospice for the Dying. Yet the knowledge
that the wings of the Angel of Death beat
day and night before its doors strikes no
note of terror in the passer-by. Rather is
there comfort in knowing that within these
walls are those whose life-work it is to
gently smooth the road to the Great Un-
known. But even this last house of call has
such mundane affairs as bills to meet. Ex-
penses creep up with every increase in the
cost of living ; and the nuns of the Sacred
Heart are forced to make one of their rare
appeals to the public. So the friends of the
Hospice have rallied round, and have
arranged an operatic and carnival ball for
October 8, and they expect Sydney’s giving
to be as generously unsectariah as the work
of the Hospice.
That friend of sick children, Mr. Wark,
is sending 5000 daffodils from his gardens
on Kurrajong Heights to he sold for the
Children’s Hospital on August 24. The
golden fairings will be on sale in the vesti-
bule of Her Majesty’s, and a cluster of
young things under the command of Mrs.
Harold Fairfax and Mrs. Philip Street will
run the Spring sales.
This is a little picture of a good man who
had to wait nearly 30 years to do the thing
he wanted to do. William Reath Olver had
just begun his medical studies when family
circumstances suddenly changed, and he had
to quit the
schools and
take a job in
Sydney. H e
married and
prospered ; and
at 46 he felt
that the time
had come
when he
could safely
go back to his
classes. But
even when he
had finished
his course in
Sydney and
got his ticket
he was not
satisfied: so
he put on his
hat and went
to Europe for
a couple of
years post-
graduate work. Then he returned, and it
gives his wide circle of friends at Chatswood
and elsewhere some satisfaction to know that
there still remained to him 18 years in which
to do the work that his mind had always
been set upon. He died last week.
The Prince doesn’t forget his promises.
When he visited the Imperial Service Club
in Sydney he remarked that the portrait of
his royal dad on the wall was not a good
one, and he’d send a better. A picture bear-
ing George R.’s signature came along re-
cently, and the Club felt so bucked up about
it that there was a special unveiling cere-
mony, and —of course —some eating.
With the first breath of Spring, Anne, only
daughter of the George Hortons, of Toogim-
bie, Hay, has announced her engagement to
Eric Learmonth. He’s the youngest son of
the Stanley Learmonths of Eulameet, Caven-
dish (Vic.).
Lieut.-Commander Haggard, R.N., who
has gone to Melbourne to marry one of the
Syme girls, is not so innocuous as his smooth
blonde head might suggest. He was in
charge of one of the submarines that got
through the Dardanelles, and managed to
make quite a mess of some of the enemy
transports before the unspeakable Turk
took him prisoner. He was held for four
years, and his entire library during that
time consisted of the wrappings from a
“patent”-medicine bottle. At present he
holds a job with Nestle’s.
Nancy Robinson, of Ashfield, drops a line
from London telling of her engagement to
David Haes, well known in Sydney in former
days. The two good Australians will be
married next month from the Switzerland
home of Nancy’s sister, and will later on
set up housekeeping in Portland-place,
London.
The E. D. Pikes, of Bradley’s Head, had a
glad little surprise to uncork with the other
things at a 21st birthday jazz given to daugh-
ter Una the other night: her engagement to
Jim, a son of the K. de L. Cudmores, of
Vaucluse —he is Goldsbrough-Mort’s Sydney
manager. Like most of the Cudmores, Jim
grows wool: his place is up Glen Innes way.
The McEacharn lady, who is at present
staying at kniglit, Owen Cox’s town flat, is
the widow of shipping-knight McEacharn,
of Melbourne. Her married daughters both
live in Scotland, and their mother, who was
a Bendigo Watson, has an estate there. But
life is sadly handicapped for her. She was
badly injured in a motor-car accident some
years ago, and still cannot move about with-
out the aid of crutches.
Helen Denny, in whom brains and beauty
were so generously mingled, took her last
good-bye of earthly things last Friday in
the new mountain home her father and
mother had just bought at Lawson. The
popular girl was a remarkable personality.
As gallant-looking as any black-haired page
from a Renaissance painting, a brilliant stu-
dent of literature, a clever writer and musi-
cian, she had the supreme gift of making
friendships that endured. The news of her
death will cause sorrow to many in all parts
of Australia.
Fifty years ago St. Stanislaus’ College
arrived in Bathurst. Dr. Quinn, the western
town’s first bishop, was responsible for this
second-oldest R.C. College in Australia. The
same energetic prelate created the St. Charles
Seminary, a training-ground for priests in
the West, which was incorporated with St.
Stan.’s for some years, till Manly College was
enlarged; then the handsome pile on the
hill was once more wholly devoted to Boy.
The old college will celebrate its golden
birthday in a few days, and much of Aus-
tralia’s best R.C. millinery will be present
at the joyful event.
The Snowy River has its fine women, too.
Sister Newnham, bush nurse at Jindabyne,
the other day, while at Ingebyra, 59 miles
south-west of Cooma, and a doctor, sent out
an SOS for a car to carry a patient to
headquarters. She found that the men
had something wrong with their cars —or
their hearts. At last she got a message
through to Mowenbah station, which skirts
the banks of the Snowy a few miles above
Dalgety. This time the call was not in
vain, and when about 10 o’clock that night
the headlights of a car lit the top of Ingebyra
Gap, Sister Newnham and two patients (one
12 hours old) were aboard. There was also
a driver, but it was a blue-eyed girl, about
sft. high and Bst. weight, who sat at the
wheel and held the car on its way. The
patients were landed at Jindabyne, and after
Sister had a few hours’ rest she and Blue
Eyes (whose every-day name is Miss E. M.
McGuflicke) wheeled about once mr-’e, col-
lected another wee mite and its mother and
brought them in.
The girl in the next flat says that she be-
lieves the widow will take the Rudolph Valen-
tino in the residential opposite from the
bachelor girl, because, though the bachelor
girl has as much charm, the widow has more
mite!
A Brisbane postscript:—
Society sallied to the final day of the Q.T.C.
carnival at Ascot, where Spring scented the air with
expectant blossom. Sir Matthew arrived after pre-
senting the prizes at the kiddies’ day at the Show,
and with him was Girl Guide Margaret Prior, who is
staying at Government House. She wore grey with
a silver-grey satin hat and a jade ostrich feather.
Mrs. O’Hara Wood, mother of tennis-playing Pat,
wore black tailor-made, with a black hat. Ethel
Campbell, of Durban, was in ivory georgette with
a black velvet lid.
In the evening the Naval Ball lured the light-
footed across to the Platypus and Adelaide, which
were stuck together with bunting, etc., at the
South Side wharf. Capt. Stevenson received the
first rush. His Ex. turned up with Capt. Harry Ham-
mond and Michael Rogers. Premier Theodore’s
wife was in black tulle with moonlight sequins,
Isobel Campbell in black satin, and Mrs. Mutton in
Egyptian red. Mrs. A. H. Whittingham had a
diamond girdle to her black frock, and Margaret Ross
Munro wore the popular dove-grey. The ward rooms
of both ships were filled with sweet-pea —and supper.
The Royal Yacht Club Ball had a very smart
decoration scheme this time. A ship was made but
of the South Brisbane City Hall, and nothing was
omitted but the water and the sea-sickness. There
were lifebelts, main-braces and awnings, a captain’s
bridge, and even ships’ bells to ring in the darice.
Mrs. Pitt Rivers, in ivory and silver, was with his
Ex. Commodore J. Love met the Gov.’s party with
the Vice-Commodore, the Rear-Commodore and Major
Swain.
The Trocadero has also been a rendezvous for
jazzing feet, Mrs. J. Cadell Garrick and her daugh-
ters being responsible for a very merry dance. Mrs.
Garrick did her hostessing in silver tissue on black
velvet; daughter Berenice in scarlet and silver, and
her sister in pale blue.
Stuartholme Convent was inspected by Mrs. Pitt
Rivers and Margaret Prior, under the guidance of
Mrs. Premier Theodore, the other morning, and a
dish of tea was prepared for them by the Sisters.
Some of the Navy were at the tea-drinking ! to
Phyllis Amery, of the “Lilac Domino,” at Lennon’s.
Edith Barry poured the cup.
The tireless Trocadero propped open its doors again
for the Tennis Ball, when Pat O’Hara Wood, his
bride and his mother were included in the also-
presents. The Ray Matthewses and George Lukin
held out the happy hand to his Ex., who came on
from the Apollo Club’s concert, and had with him
the Leonard Browns and F. Briggs, of Politic.
At the aforementioned concert, Phyllis Edwards,
of Sydney, was showered with Brisbane's best floral
stuff because of her fine contralto, and her lime
taffeta frock with vandvkc flounces was another grati-
fying item on the programme.
Sir Matthew lunched the Allan Wilkies as they
fled through Brisbane on their way south. He also
dined the Leonard Browns and Briggs, of Politic,
while cheery Dr. Campbell, his lady and the beloved
Ethel made a brief stay at the vice-regal gunyah.
The Consul for Norway, Capt. O. Svensen, handed
over daughter Marjorie to the keeping of Thomas
Campbell, of Wonbah station, at St. John’s Cathe-
dral the other day. There was much silver braid
on the bride’s net overdress on cloth of silver.
George Sampson played the organ, parson Gradwell
tied the knot, and a hundred guests drank their
healths at Norway, Norman Park.


A Complete Answer to
Your Motoring Needs.
The New Superior
CHEVROLET
IT is when the motor-car is considered as a necessity
for both business and for pleasure that the twofold
economy of the New Superior Chevrolet is fully
realised.
IT is not logical to pay exorbitantly for such a
necessity when the Chevrolet offers all that is required
in performance and in appearance for a very moderate
outlay and maintenance cost that is exceptionally low.
For economical
tramportation —
nothing compares
with Chevrolet.

G.-G. Forster got out of a sick bed to take
the salute at the gubernatorial shivoo to
the Science Congressers. It was a charming
party, staged with a nice touch of official
circumstance which hinted at the possible
restoration of pre-war ceremonial. The
vice-regal pair shook hands with the process-
ing GOO in front of a blazing fire in the State
parlor, where banks of wattle and masses
of poinsettia provided a colorful duet in
scarlet and gold. Her Ex. smiled her greet-
tings over ermine-stoled shoulders, rising
from a misty sea of blue crepe, broken mid-
way by a crystal glitter. Acting-Gov. Irvine,
with his dame and daughter Beatrice, stood
below, both the latter inkily-velveted, but
the younger with a gold lace under-skirt.
Priminister Bruce couldn’t get away from
the fevered political arena that night, and
his wife, who has been plunged into mourn-
ing by the death of a Manifold uncle, was
also an absentee. Laura Nyulasy trailed
Undine-like draperies of seaweed green en-
meshed with silver, which breathed of gay
Paris; and Mrs. Ernest Scott’s mandarin
robes came in for discussion. Big W. J. T.
Clarke convoyed his wife, who plumped up
during her English trip, and lias dropped the
Queen Maryish touch in her upholsterings.
The James Barr: t knight loomed large and
bemedalled alor "side his pleasant little wife.
The Edward ? 'Fcliell pair brought a daugh-
ter who flared lengthily in red encrusted with
silver. Arc 1 bish. Lees headed a clerical con-
tingent, aid headmasters Adamson and
“Lofty” Franklin the schoolmastering lot.
The scientists and their ladies groped
through a heavy fog to receive their State
Parliamentary welcome on Friday night.
Mrs. Law T son, in amber silk of distinctly
French origin, helped her Premier with the
handshakes. Below the pair a group of poli-
tical ’eads and their wives were lined up like
wax|works, while some of the overseas visi-
tors drooped with the isolated air of stran-
gers in a strange land. The McPherson
lady, in string-colored chiffonery, stood in
the (Official pen, near the Arthur Robinson
darpe, whose “pailletted” draperies glinted
like the Milky Way. Mrs. Harry Payne pro-
vided the frocky sensation of the evening—
a thing of wine-colored silk with new-way
draperies, embroideries of the same tint en-
riching her top storey. Mrs. Littleton Groom,
whose Ministerial husband was anchored in
the House, moved handsomely in black veil-
ings ’prisoned under lengthway bars of jet.
Daughter Jessie dimpled above tempestuous
petticoats of blue. The Maudsley dame
trailed inky georgette gladdened with flights
of Silver birds, and daughter Cecil was a
streak of soft green with a dash of lace at
the shoulders. Dame Adelaide Anderson, in
bladk, buzzed like an active little mosquito,
while Mrs. Jimmy Dyer, who convoyed a
brace of scientist visitors, struck a hectic
note in scarlet. Mrs. Bertie Austifi sand-
wiched glittering silvery armor between
dusky tulle skirt wings. Lauchie Mackin-
non: was grass-widowering with his little lot of
scientists, and big W. J. T. Clarke w
alscj out minus his other half. Mrs. Frank
Clarke was adorable in black sheathings
A Californian girl who is making a honey-
moon trip of the science jaunt with her hus-
band, Dr. Sweet, was as a shamrock in
green. Prof, and Mrs. Agar—she in blue
with silver-lace entanglements—brought
scientist Babcock and his wife. Supper,
which overloaded a mile or more of buffet-
table, gladdened the second half.
Rita Selby and her dad, who are packing
for a fresh inspection of London, bagged
half Carlyon’s ball-floor the other night for
a jazzy au revoir to their pals. Hostess
Rita radiated in shimmering apricot satin,
equatored with brilliants, while tangerine
plumes nodded welcomes from her topmast.
Every man in the party bore off a giddy
little kewpie, chastely clothed in a set of
au revoir verses from Margaret Waugh’s
pen; and the chiffoned half of the jazzers
had floral armlets or other such light jin-
garee encased in poetic wrappings to carry
away as souvenirs.
The organ of the Collins-street Indepen-
dent Church is out of action pending its re-
building, and on a recent Sunday the choral
part of the service was supported by a por-
tion of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra,
with Alberto Zelman on the box-seat. So
there was a fine harmonious frill on the
service. Then, during the offertory, a violin
solo from Massenet’s “Thais” floated through
the building, and the dreamy thing seemed
to be thoroughly enjoyed by even the stern-
est-looking elders. It was a situation that
would have wrung a cynical chuckle from
Anatole France. Still, Thais did “get re-
ligion,” didn’t she?
Mrs. Tommy Cotter, Agar Wynne’s step-
daughter (the child of his first wife), passed
out a few days ago, after only a few months
of widowhood. As Jean Robertson, Mrs.
Cotter, who was something of an heiress,
made a hobby of globe-trotting, and circled
the earth more than once. The first time
tne eldest Byron Moore daughter (now Mrs.
Gordon) helned her to inspect the world’s
wonders. After her marriage with a good-
looking young tea-planter, who was the son
of an Irish baronet, she was content to
anchor among her native gum-trees at Bea-
consfield. The other Robertson girl, ndsie,
married and settled in the Cold Country.
Mrs. Cotter’s death leaves two small child-
ren parentless, and they are being comforted
by their kindly step-grandfather and his wife.
There has been no rush of women candi-
dates for the Vic. municipal elections which
are being held this week. Apparently Mrs.
Mary Rogers, of Richmond, is destined to be
for some time the only skirted councillor. If
she is made mayor she will be entitled for
two years to sit on the bench, and be called
“your (hie) Washup” by penitent drunks o’
Monday mornings.
Her onward march continues. Mrs. Tay-
lor, gen. sec. of the Australian Women’s
Assoc, .(.full sister to the A.N.A.), has been
elected presedent of the Friendly Societies’
Assoc. If Disney’s bill goes through this
session \ye may have a skirted President of
the Uppah Chambah before 1930. The first
step is to make her eligible for membership.
On a night of shrouding fog, Essendon’s
Mayoral Return Ball rolled cheerily and
crowdedly in the Moonee Ponds Civic Hall.
The star turn of the evening came when local
member Thomas Ryan, in the name of his
fellow citizens, handed Mayor Garrard an
expensively-furnished travelling-case, and
Mrs. Garrard a diamond brooch. Thereafter
the leaders of the deb. contingent at the
Mayoral Ball blushfully added evidence of
the appreciation of the united buds, in the
shape of a silver casserole. Not to be out-
done, Mrs. Garrard, in mole-colored chif-
fonery with jet and silver embellishments,
presented each young thing with a photo of
all the debs, grouped around herself, to re-
mind them of their budding. Then she
breathed her thanks over a presentation
trophy of pink roses. Most of the leading
local lights were there —Essendon people are
loyal supporters of their own suburb. Mrs.
Tom Ryan draped her cherry-colored silk in
black net. Mrs. Hiskens, cloaked in fuchsia
over mole, brought daughter Violet, who
sported a gold-lined sash with her blaca
frock, and had in attendance fiance Ronald
Irving, son of the lengthy General.
This profile, pictured by Rembrandt, be-
longs to Kathleen Hannah, a damsel who
also owns a
dramatic
soprano of
fine size and
quality. She
is a Nagambie
girl, and has
all her past
before her, as
she has only
just fare-
welled her
’teens. Three
years ago she
left her ’way-
back home to
have her voice
shaped by
Maggie Stir-
ling, who has
done wonders
for it. Kath-
leen cherishes
hopes of one
day getting on
the noisy side of the footlights in comic
opera, and as she has the appearance and
ambition, as well as the voice, she and her
friends will be horribly disappointed if she
doesn't get there.
The medical Charles Alsops (she was
daughter of the late Dean Vance) brought
their chick Helen from Gippsland to hand her
over to Nevinson Faulkner, son of the late
Sunbury medico. Garnett Shaw, the bride-
groom’s old war-battalion padre, helped
Vicar Law to tie the knot at Toorak
St. John’s, which was crowded with the best
people of this and the pre-war age. The
bride’s snowy satin sparkled with delicate
crystal traceries under the fine old Limerick
lace veil first worn by her grandmother, the
late Mrs. David Alsop. This was anchored
with orange-blossoms, while more blooms
weighted the panel train, which was upheld
by the bridegroom’s small cousin, Suzanne
Hammond, an adorable bit of plumpness in
a white Kate Greenaway frock. Sisters
Feggy and Phyllis Alsop and Marcia Faulk-
ner followed on in apricot-colored georgette
with gold lace collars, and yards of the
same georgette floated from floral wreaths
binding their heads, while gold lace hedged
tMir posies of yellow roses. _ Mrs.
Alsop lit up her black marocain with Oriental
embroidery under an osprey-laden head; and
the Faulkner widow’s beauty was emphasised
by solid black veilings, unrelieved beyond a
mauve hand posy. Her sister, Mrs. Stan
Hammond, likewise favored black, but she had
gladdened her hat with purple flowers.. Another
sister, Miss Webb, flew grey draperies. The
trio are daughters of the. late Captain Webb,
an old Brighton identity. The subsequent
health-drinking happened at Toorak’s big-
gest guestery, Illawarra.
John Asche, who died at Longreach (Q-)
recently, had little of his half-brother Oscar
about him except a commanding height. John
was a fair man, with a rather classical nose
and a typically Scandinavian order of coun-
tenance. A touch of gentlemanly bombast,
perhaps, but no Oscarian swagger. He will
be missed in the pastoral and squatting com-
mercial circles of Melbourne.
This is a Rembrandt study of Myra
Morris, the Victorian girl whose name is
with increasing
frequency at-
tached to story
and verse. She
developed the
writing habit
almost as soon
as she learned
to handle a
pen, and three
years ago she
left her old
bush home by
th h Murray
and migrated
to a Melbourne
flat, from the
door of which
she kept the
wolf with her
active nib. But
the i Morris
family has
notv come to
town, and
Myra is back in her own domestic circle,
which has a Toorak address.
The Harry Payne son and daughter spread
a gorgeous dinner for 50 at Menzies’ the
other night as a farewell to the Alec Russell
pair and Commander Bush, who are part of
the circus that Priminister Brfice is going
to introduce to England shortly. Hostess
Ella was marocained in apricot, caught c:i
the port side with a paste buckle. After
the final course the half-hundred went on to
Bibron’s dance-hall, where they topped off
with a fox-trot.
Kathleen Luscombe and young- Bob Sim-
son, who confessed to intending matrimony
last month, after a Mother State wooing,
have now fixed the date for Tuesday and
the place St. John’s, Toorak. It will be a
subdued affair, as Bob Simson, the elder, one
of our best-gilded woolgrowers, is tripping
oversea with his wife and daughter Estelle.
The L. K. S. Mackinnon matron will act
in loco parentis to her nephew. Col. Lus-
combe was Base-Commandant here prior
to unloading his Permanent Artillery trap-
pings—before that he wore his brass cap on
the Sydney side.
Eighty dames and damsels have just been
having a glorious time at Dookie College
for 10 days. Coming from all parts of the
State and from across the they took
a rapid course in the domestic arts, horti-
culture and home tittivation. Between
demonstrations and lectures they had excur-
sions, dances, concerts —never such fun
since their schooldays. And all for a couple
of guineas, with holiday railway fares added.
It was vacation-time for the ordinary stu-
dents, and that was why the accommodation
was available.
V.R.C-. chairman L. K. S. Mackinnon is
the hereditary owner of a kilt. His late
father was a meenister in the Isle of Skye,
where the big, ruddy-haired Scot owns a nice
little acreage. “Scobie,” as his pals call him,
has the genial Highland personality which
makes him popular with all his fellow V.R.C.
folk, from stewards to stable boys. The Mac-
kinnons have been sheltering in the seaside
house since the disbanding of the Toorak
homestead, after the death of their only
daughter. They will shortly unpack in the
South Yarra place-they bought from Reggie
Powers, and are now practically remodelling.
The finances of the Hawthorn end of the
Children’s Hospital Auxiliary will get a lift
from a card-party engineered by its active-
minded president, Mrs. Latham, and her
sister committee-women. It was staged in
the Lathams’ roomy bungalow, Flete, and the
cards fluttered in the hall, drawing-room and
library. Mrs. Latham, who is the wife of
the M.H.R., hostessed in mole-colored silk,
with a suggestion of Oriental patterning on
the lower deck, and she wore a rather imnres-
sively large brown hat.
Besides being proud of the success of many
of his old students at Trinity College, Dr.
Leeper’s chest is swelling over the headway
his son Rex makes in the diplomatic service.
He has become first sec. to the British Lega-
tion at Warsaw, and was Charge d’Affaires
(in the absence of the Minister) when
Roumania’s monarch and queen visited the
capital of the Polish Republic. Head of
Melbourne Grammar School, Melb. ’Varsity
and Oxford graduate, then Foreign Office
attache, he moved on step by step to his
present job.
Mrs. Isabella a’Beckett did not long sur-
vive her knightly husband, who, when he re-
tired a few years ago, was senior judge of
the Supreme Court. Two or three times he
acted for a week or two as Administrator of
the Government, but he kept out of the lime-
light, and only for his signature on docu-
ments you wouldn t have known that he was
about. Three daughters and two sons sur-
vive, one of the latter being head of a Mel-
bourne law firm.
Frank McNamara, of the Australian Air
Force, who was one of the first to capture
a V.C. in Palestine, proposes to link his
life and fortune with Helene Marcelle Blunt-
schili, whose sister is Mrs. D. P. H. Roth,
of Rose Bay, Sydney. The Bluntschilis
come from Heliopolis, where their late dad
had a job under the Egyptian Government.
He was a Swiss.
At the Lipkovska concert on Saturday
applause was led by a man in the front
chairs who held his hands aloft and banged
them together with a huge noise. Those
obtrusive hands seemed to say “This is how
it’s done —copy us!” They worried one. As
long as the blonde Lydia was on the stage
her wondrous costume of the moment
attracted favorable notice; but when she left
the platform your eyes turned in the direc-
tion of those upraised paws, and you started
wondering whether this overhead tumult was
a Russian custom.
Frank Russell, the lawyer who writes the
stirring stories of actresses and their habits
for Melbourne Herald, is the proud father
of a play, “Harewood Blood,” which is to
be staged in London shortly.
Little Fanny Wiseman, whose record as an
Australian actress is positively unique, has
been ailing this winter. Maggie Moore came
here with her husband nearly 50 years ago,
and Nellie Stewart has been with us from
childhood. But Fanny Wiseman! The little
old lady, now 77, looks back 70 years to her
nrst appearance as a fairy in a pantomime
at the long-forgotten theatre in Queen-street.
Since then she has played many parts at
home and across the seas. One of her last
actings in Melbourne was as the Nurse in
“Romeo and Juliet.” A wonderfully natural
little nurse she was, with a gentle smile, and
an eye like a sparrow’s for the main chance.
That was when Mrs. Allan Wilkie played
Juliet.
Adelaide drops a line or two: —
The point-to-point Steeplechase took all the hunt-
ing fraternity and their friends to Findon to see
Paul Teesdale Smith steer Mazourk to victory for
the second time in succession. He and his wife
are easily two of the most popular members of the
Club, and the congratulatory speeches at the Hunt
dinner at the South Australian in the evening were
of that rare variety that mean even more than they say.
Mrs. A. McDonald is moving from Canowie to
town, and was duly feted and farewelled by half
the feminine . population of Jamestown before she
left. She is of the Murray clan, and her daugh-
ter is one of the best-looking of the younger set.
Hits off to the District Trained Nurse! There
are 33 of her in this State now. In the past 12
months she has paid close on 5000) visits, and is
gradually extending her activities further up the
Murray and into the newly-settled districts. Motor
scooters are gradually displacing the bikes on
which district nurses have pedalled about for so
long, and there was a curious crowd at the Town
Hall the other afternoon to see a half-dozen of
them scoot off on their new toys.
There was a huge crowd at Seaton to see T. E.
Howard annex the open golf championship, a crowd
that included their Exes., with Miss Judge and Capt.
Hambleton, and whose feminine element was mostly
in country tweeds and knitted raiment with hats of
every color. It has been a golfers’ week, of course,
with the Maxwell Fowler, Sydney Rymill, Clive
Milrie, Julian Ayers, Herbert Rymill, Britten Jones,
Francis Fisher and Lance Lewis dames, Dorothy
; Jessop, doctors Brian Swift and Anstey Giles, and W.
J. Gunson among the hosts and hostesses who’ve been
doing their best to help the eastern visitors go gay.
The Blue-and-White dance, with half-a-dozen old
St. Peter’s boys as hosts, was staged in the Osborne
Hall. The C. W. Hayward, A. G. Price and A, G.
Rymill matrons did the honors—-the two former in
smart black and Mrs. Rymill in tomato-colored chif-
fon velvet. She, by the way, had her just-grown-up
daughter with her, in almond-green georgette, bc-
panelled and beaded with fine-cut steel.
Mrs. Geoffrey Duffield, who is returning to England,
was farewelled at a tea given by. sister-in-law Mrs.
Kenneth Duffield at Glienelg on one of the few decent
days we’ve had f’rages, with the sea all agbtter and
the almond-trees in every cottage garden on, the way-
down adrift with blossom. There was music, mostly
catchy fragments from Kenneth Duffield’s “Snap,
and a song or two by the small Duffield children, the
words written by the youngest of the trio, who should
become a useful collaborator with his musical uncle
if he goes on as he has begun.

This is the REXOPORT
closed for carrying. A handsome cabinet
of the highest-grade imported oak, beauti-
fully figured and polished. As handy to
carry as a small suitcase, and weighing
only 1 31b. complete. Size, 1 Oin. x 1 3in.
x 6^in.
This is the Rexoport, opened for playing.
Note how refinements present on non-
portable machines have been ingeniously
included in the minimum of space on the
Rexoport: Tapering Tone Arm, Nickel-
plated Turntable Brake, Speed Regulator,
Needle Box. But more important than all
these is the Rexonola Patented Reflector
Sound Chamber, which gives the Rexoport
remarkable richness, range and volume of
tone.
This is the lid of the Rexoport, which can
either be left hinged to the body of the
instrument, or detached and used as a
stand, as shown here. In the lid is a com-
partment in which eight double-sided
records may be securely packed for
carrying. There is also a space for the
winding handle to be carried in the lid.
This is the Ideal
Portable
Talßing' Machine
for the Home or
Out-of-Doors.
It is the most compact, well finished, handy little portable
talking-machine in Australia.
In tone quality it is worthy to play the best of music;
its tone volume is large enough to make it ideal for
dancing purposes.
It plays all makes of disc records, giving you a range of
many thousands of selections to choose from.
The Rexoport is entirely self-contained, even including a
record-carrying compartment, and when closed is so
adjusted that all parts are firmly held, eliminating risk
of damage.
Ask any Rexonola dealer to demonstrate the points of
superiority of the Rexoport, the portable Rexonola, to
you.

PROPERLY
In the brisk days of the Sydney pony-
flogging industry the races started at half-past 10
and lasted till 5, with 25-minute intervals. At
Rosebery on Saturday they began at 2, and were
oyer by half-past 4; also, one man, Skelton, owned
most of the runners (he supplied the field in two
events) and collected nearly all the prize-money.
The crowd was mostly composed of officials, book-
makers, police, pressmen and stable-boys, and the
only speculator on the grandstand tote got Bs. fid.
back—a Treasury clerk deducted Is. 6d. for the
Fuller Government—and he backed a winner, too.
Ail this was due to a strike of owners and trainers
and a sympathetic strike of jockeys, with the Labor
party extending its blessing to both. The strikers
ostensibly took action because Skelton and others
refused to join their Owners and Trainers’ Associa-
tion, but their real grievance is against the pony
clubs, which are reaping prodigious profits, whereas
the man with one or two horses finds it increasingly
hard to make a living. The truth is that pony-
racing is the cause of an enormous amount of
misery and social unrest, and a really strong Gov-
ernment, recognising that neither party to the con-
troversy has a leg to stand on, would effect a
settlement by a 75 p.c. reduction of racing dates.
But the pony proprietors have a powerful political
pull; and, anyhow, the Fuller combination isn’t
that sort of Government.

Stable commissions for Maoriland horses
are worth following in Sydney at this time of year.
The steeds from over the water are more forward,
as a rule, than the local prads in training for the
rich October handicaps at Randwick, and they are
of superior quality to the suburban platers that
bloom during the winter and are faded flowers, some
of them, in August. At the Rosehill club’s meeting
on the Canterbury Park course F. D. Jones, the M.L.
trainer, started three of his string and all won—
Urgency the Rosehill Handicap, at 3’s; Ballymena
the second division of the Highweight, at 7 to 2 ;
and Zaragoza the third division of the Maiden, at
10 to 9. McCarten rode the three. In addition,
Gold Buckle annexed the first division of the Maiden,
at 7 to 2, and Vespucci, a 20-to-l shot, dead-heated
(with L.A.) for the first division of the Highweight;
both have done their racing in M.L., though bred in
Australia. After Urgency’s success there were in-
quiries about him for the Metropolitan, in which he
has 7st. 81b. But he is only moderate, and one can't
see him beating a good mare like Even Song at a
difference of 31b.
“0.K.”: This season, perhaps, the rich
A.J.C. Derby prize will be captured by a really great
horse, which none of the last three winners has been.
Salitros, certainly, was a dual Derby winner, but the
three-year-olds who ran in the classic events of 1920
were below par, and since then Randwick blue-rib-
boners have not been the best colts of their respective
years. Previously, when there was less money hang-
ing to the Derby, the winner was a flier, as a rule.
The immediate predecessors of the washy-looking
Salitros were Artilleryman and Richmond Main (dead
heat), Gloaming and Biplane. It would have been
interesting to hear old Chaafe, who died in M.L.
last week, talk of modern Derbies and added money.
Chaafe trained Glove, winner of the first Derby at
Randwick in 1865—10 years later than the first Mel-
bourne Derby race.

The racing at Flemington was notable for
some vindications of recent form. On August 8
Moneth beat Valvoid over six furlongs, with an
advantage of 111 b. in the weights. Four days before
Valvoid had' beaten San Antonio, giving him a lot
of weight, and, as San Antonio came out as a winner
on August 11, it looked as though Valvoid had been
perhaps unlucky to get such a thrashing from
Moneth earlier in the month. Last Saturday the
pair met again, the handicap being 131 b. kinder to
the son of Valido. He turned the tables on Moneth,
who finished second, and to confirm the merit of his
performance San Antonio, very much up in the han-
dicapper’s estimation, ran a dead heat with Evelyn
Hatan for the last race. So, in five recent events,
Valvoid, Moneth and San Antonio filled eight out of
the ten first-two places—winner, runner-up or dead-
heater every time.
The Rover had to run away with the August Han-
dicap or be classed as a rogue indeed. Except Scarlet
the field of five contained nothing with any preten-
sions to beat a gelding that had won an Australian
Cup easily, and only failed by a little bit to win a
Melbourne Cup. And The Rover was giving Scarlet
101 b. only. The books laid 6 to 4 against the good
thing on account of his evil reputation, but here
there was nothing to test his temper. All he had
to do was go to the front as soon as urged, and race
away at his ease, even though he was not in the
pink of condition.
The Three-year-old Handicap, which last year
brought The Cypher and Whittier into notice, was
not improbably a guide to this season’s future.
Quintus was plainly in need of many gallops, but
the running of Frances Tressady and Sultry and
Longworthy was disappointing and must be scored
against them. The three placed horses, however, can
all be kept in mind. Graculus and Gungool, com-
fortable winner and close third respectively, are
stylish youngsters, both in Bradfield’s stable. The
colt Graculus, by Magpie, is a bay with black points
and never a spot of white on him. The filly Gun-
gool, by Lanius, is coated likewise. They look hard
and likely, especially the amiable Graculus. Neither
of them is nearly so showy as chestnut Tabragalba,
a big lump of a colt. Bob Lewis rode Tabragalba
this time and got him quickly off the mark, but the
best the big fellow could do was to split Bradfield’s
pair, whilst wayward Scylax, Longworthy and Quin-
tus were losing ground.

“Gimlet W.”: The Westralian Savings
Bank was recently defrauded of considerable sums
by a party of Perth knuts, the leader being a
young bank clerk. Some of the ill-gotten gains
were risked on the purchase of Bronzine, an aged
gelding by imported Bronzino out of that great mare
Maltine. Bronzine was just striking form when the
fraud was discovered, and warrants were issued for
the knuts’ arrest. A few days after they were gathered
in, he won at a suburban meeting. A few days
before they came up for trial he won again—at
6 to 1. That was on August 11, and seven days
later the nag galloped away with the Boulder New-
market, Westralia’s richest sprint, at 4’s. In the
meantime the cockerels who bought him had been
found guilty and remanded for sentence. 'The
moral is—anything you please.
* * * *
South Aus. is the one mainland State in
which racing isn’t overdone. Mcßook doesn’t ply
his noxious calling on S.A. courses, neither is the
professional punter allowed to spread himself over
the columns of rape-and-murder newspapers with nar-
ratives in Munchausen’s vein. The sport gets along
famously with comparatively few meetings and the
totalisator, and a useful breeding industry is
nourished thereby. Goldenform, winner of the A.R.C.
National Hurdle, returned his backers £6l 10s. for
£l. No bookmaker in captivity would have laid
half the odds one —two. The disappointing Argosy
Boy paid £1 15s. for running second, and the third
horse was the Victorian Bronzillet, one of the favor-
ites on the machine. Old Pistolier fell at the first
hurdle. The beautifully-bred King of Mirth, by
Comedy King—Little Joan, made a one-horse affair
of the Guineas. Wiralla, a Sir Simon colt of Sidney
Kidman’s, landed the first division of the Fulham
Park Plate, the initial flutter for two-year-olds, and
the second division went to Bleu de Ciel, a gelding
by Cape Sky—Lisnabin. Kidman’s colors are not
often seen on a racecourse, but his brother Charlie
raced many good horses in Westralia years agone.

Frank Bailey, the South Sydney young-
ster, put up a sterling performance by winning the
five-miles cross-country championship of N. S. Wales
in 27fnin 20sec. —33sec. better than the previous
best. Bailey showed the way over the stiff Rand-
wick course to a field of 52, three of them
Maorilanders. R. A. Rose (M.L.) was the
second man home, and with a week’s move condi-
tion on him he should trouble the judges in the
race for the Australasian title, which will be con-
tested at the week-end by representatives of N. S.
Wales, Queensland, Tasmania, Victoria, S. Australia
and Maoriland. It was a bright day for the Botany
Harriers. At Randwick they won the teams race
for the third timel in four years, and at Brisbane
the three-mile track championship of Queensland, 11. S.
Grandemange annexing that and the one-mile a week
before. Parcell was the runner-up on each occasion.
Some uncommonly fast times were recorded at this
Brisbane meeting, which was held at the Exhibi-
tion grounds. H. V. Scouller was clocked to win
the hundred in 9 9-10 sec., and Norman Grehan, the
furlong in 21 4-ssec. If the times are correct, both
lads have strong claims for inclusion in the Olympic
team.

Barney Ruebens, alleged to be bantam
champion of Boerland, was skittled in four rounds
by Bobbie Gray on Saturday night. The Jew-
boy had nothing but the gameness of his race, and
it was a shame to send him into the ring—what the
poor devil obviously needed was a square meal.
There are still persons of weak intellect who put
their trust in Stadium publicity, wherefore they
paid £2 3s. 4d-, including tax, to see Herman “fight
for 90 seconds and Ruebens for 10 minutes. Boxing
promoters should be thankful that a “ ‘mug’ is born
every minute.”
* * * *
“Linesman” : The Australians have had a
luckier run than usual for the Davis Cup. They
played a weaker Japanese team than they encoun-
tered in the U.S. a couple of years back, and the
absence from Europe of the Spanish champion, Manoel
Alonzo, who beat Tilden the other day, indirectly
smoothed our path to the challenge round. Had
Alonzo lined up with his countryman De Gomar in
the European matches Spain, instead of France, would
surely have faced us at Boston, and the battle would
have been a hard one indeed. Lacoste was no match
for Anderson in the singles, nor Brugnon for Hawkes,
the Gauls being beaten in straight sets. In the
doubles, however, the Australians had to keep moving
till the fifth set, which they won 9-7, and then
Laeoste conquered Mclnnes —6-2, 6-1, 6-2. A fine
backhand player, he is weak on the forehand, which
left him open to attack from Anderson’s best stroke.
However, he is a youngster of rare promise. The
curious thing about the French team was the absence
of Gochet in the singles. He is a much better man
than Brugnon.
* * * *
Australia holds the record for doubles vic-
tories in Davis Cup encounters. Barring the down-
fall at the final in Auckland in 1920, when Brookes
and Patterson were badly beaten by Tilden and
Johnston, the Australians haven’t lost a doubles
engagement for many years. Their most sensational
win happened last year, when Patterson and O’Hara
Wood downed Tilden and Richards by 18 games to 4.
Superb team-work and concentration on the weaker
man, Richards, whom the indefatigable Tilden was
unable to save, were responsible for the triumph,
and it is recorded that Tilden was so baffled that
he showed signs of frayed temper towards the finish.
The clinching match against Fiance, in which Laeoste
and Brugnon pushed Anderson and Hawkes to 62
games, is the longest sustained struggle in the his-
tory of the Cup. Considering that the Frenchmen
were only four games down in the aggregate, they
are entitled to congratulations for an heroic effort.
Indeed, seeing that they were playing on grass and
were inferior in experience to the Australians, they
deserve a . medal. If they have entered for the U.S.
national doubles commencing in Boston this week,
they ought to go very near the final.
* * * *
“15-30” : Tilden’s prediction that Anderson
and Hawkes would lose their matches with Shimidzu
and Fukuda shows how the best judges on the spot
may go astray in their calculations. Anderson plays
a game that is peculiarly difficult to Shimidzu on
account of its high proportion of low cross-court
shots. The main reason for Shimidzu’s defeat of the
Australian two years back was that the Jap forced his
impulsive opponent to overwork his favorite hit,
which, at that time, had not nearly the severity it
now possesses. Anderson, moreover, is better equipped
now to hammer the Jap’s service, which, according
to American accounts, is only moderately well-placed
at its best. Tilden has always had great respect for
Anderson, and the fall of Shimidzu will increase the
SAFETY FIRST.
REFEREE: “One, two, three”
FED-UP PUG: “Save yuh breff, boss; I ain’t gonna git up.”
Yankee’s regard for his opponent at Forest Hills
next week ; but, unless Tilden has staled, his all-round
ability should prevail over Anderson’s merit as a
forehand smiter. Anyway, Anderson will have to
“mix it” to win. He can’t hope to score as heavily
with forehand aecs, and must expect a well-considered
attack on his backhand, which, barring the match
with Laeoste, has apparently never encountered any
serious assault this season. And in Johnston he will
be meeting a magnificent driver off either hand. The
match with Johnston will reveal J.O.’s actual stand-
ing among the world champions. Hawkes’s chance
of beating cither of the Americans looks remote.
If Mrs. Molcsworth doesn’t go to Paris
as a member of the Olympic Games team it won’t
be because Queensland has been lukewarm in her
cause. The smiling dame was in first-class form
when the Australian championships were decided at
Brisbane. Plump Miss Lance (N.S.W.) took a set
from her, but the Queenslander played beautifully
in the third and deciding set, and in the final she
never gave Miss Boyd (Vic.) a chance. The two
southern girls got a consolation prize in the ladies’
doubles, in which they vanquished Mrs. Molesworth
and Miss Turner, and so did St. John in the men’s
doubles, his partner being O’Hara Wood. In the
singles the Victorian easily accounted for the
Queenslander after the latter had overcome another
veteran, Horrie Rice, in a gruelling struggle.
“Gymnast”: “Pantagruel” (B. 2/8/’23) is wrong
when he says that 0. B. St. John has been
undefeated since 1909. In 1914, a few weeks before
he left Australia with the 9th Battalion, Ray Shirley
won the Queensland metropolitan championship. The
same year, with Rattan as partner, Ray gathered in
the doubles. Shirley’s last game of tennis was played
at the Khedival Club in Egypt, when he defeated
the champion of Egypt to an accompaniment' of
joyous yells from his Digger pals..
“Centurion”: O. B. St. John (B. 2/8/’23) is not
only a tennis crack but has been a fine performer
in other games, in spite of the fact that he has
been minus the right hand from birth. Though small
and light, he represented the Rugby Union in several
matches, at full back, his catching and handling
of the tricky Rugby ball being uncanny. In cricket
he was a really good slow bowler and was a hard
man to shift as last man in. When batting he
rested his maimed right wrist at the top of the
bat handle, taking a grip with the left.
About 50,000 Melburnians poughed up
£2200 on Saturday to see the Vic. Leaguers turn
the tables on South Australia. The ground was a
quagmire, even as the Adelaide oval was on June 30,
and speedy as the Croweaters were, the Vies, were
speedier. The visitors excelled in accurate passing,
but only at short distances ; they marked well singly,
but in a bunch a Dark Blue mostly got the ball or
got it away. From back line to half-forward. S,A.
passed the leather with deadly precision; but there
the solid Victorian backs turned the tide. Stockdale
had 10 shots for 6 behinds, till someone accidentally
handed him what the boys call a “blood nose.” That
straightened his vision and he kicked two goals.
Scott, Scanlon, Mucklow (until injured), Daly,
McGregor and Whitehead shone for the Croweaters.
But determination won the match, and none was
more resolute than Tandy, the little fiery-haired South
Melbourne rover. Scores: Vic., 9 goals 15 behinds;
S. Aus., 4 goals 5 behinds.
“Wink”: Victoria’s different reading of two rules
—holding the ball, and holding the man—hampered
South Oss. In the first case neither side really
fulfilled the law and punched the leather, but the
Vies., feigning better, were seldom penalised; their
opponents, on the other hand, transgressed more
openly and were frequently punished. Often a free
kick would be given against a Sossie for holding the
ball because a well-beaten Vic. had managed to
clutch him momentarily as he dashed past. Thus, the
“tiggie” rule, in vogue in Victoria through a too-
strict reading of the laws, is an annoyance to South
Australians, whose game, more spectacular and dash-
ing through a looser interpretation of it, is generally
disorganised by Melbourne umpires. On a dry ground,
with a 50-50 umpire, my cash would be on the
Adelaide men; and to my mind the fact that Vic-
toria rushed Bryant into their team is a confession
of weakness. He is a South Australian who has
played in Melbourne less than half a season.
Another Victorian XVIII came over to Sydney
to play N. S. Wales and word fairly and squarely
licked—the first time it has happened in the long
series of matches with the Ma State. The visitors
led by 61 points to 45 at half-time, but the Sydney
men scored 35 points to 12 in the third quarter
and 21 to 12 in the final term, ending with 15 goals
11 behinds to 11 goals 19 behinds. Fine high-mark-
ing and accurate kicking were the principal factors
in their meritorious win.
The new .municipal golf
links in Adelaide are right in
the city; they extend from
just behind the Oval along
the park lands, below the hill
on which North Adelaide
stands. The obstacles have
not been made severe, but
evidently they take a bit of
knowing. In the opening
event, for professionals from
all the States and M.L.,
Rufus Stewart, a local man,
went round in 74 and a mar-
vellous 67. Of the other 15
starters, Rowley Banks, Car-
negie Clark, lies and Spicer
dead-heated 10 strokes behind
the winner. On this form,
Stewart looked to have a capi-
tal chance of bringing the
open championship of the con-
tinent to S. Aus., but he
played at Seaton under the
handicap of a heavy cold.
Tommy Howard, the Concord
(N.S.W.) professional, won
with a card of 301 (74, 78,
75, 74), from the. Maorilander
Ham (304) and the unlucky
Carnegie plark (305), with Ivo
Whitton, Popplewell, Stewart
and Campbell, the title-holder,
following in that order. Whit-
ton didn’t strike form till
the second day; bis last round
(70) equalled Joe Kirkwood’s
record for the course. But,
like Kirkwood, the amateur
champion is a player of moods.
The N.S.W. Rugby Union team started
badly in M.L., a Wellington XY beating them by
29 points to 16. However, the tourists will not be
at full strength until Nothling, Stanley, Sheehan
and Taylor are in their accustomed places; they
left Sydney for the Dominion on Saturday. Future
N. S. Wales XV’s will certainly include some of the
St. Joseph’s players, who completed a great sequence
of successes by downing King’s School for the G.P.S.
premiership. St. Joseph’s scored 21 to 9, which
made their season’s total 250 points against 82.
Union Rugby is in no danger so long as the code is
played in the secondary schools.
* * * *
With Thompson in the pavilion, North
Sydney failed against Eastern Suburbs, but they
made an exciting match of it. A minute or so before
time the scores were 10 all; then Hodgins, sorely
pressed, booted for touch and the ball was grabbed
by Rigney, who dlaimed a mark. Arthur Oxford
raised the bunting with the last kick of the dav.
In other attempts he had fared badly, but the win-
ning goal was a beauty. It was East’s eleventh
successive win and North’s fourth defeat. South
Sydney licked Balmain by 15 to 6; the Dockers
came strongly when it was too late. Western
Suburbs administered another hiding to Newtown,
and St. George handed ’Varsity their usual weekly
licking. Unless a miracle happens, Eastern Suburbs
will be premiers, and South Sydney should be runners
up, with North third.
* * * *
The Chinese Soccer footballers, now in
N. S. Wales, are interesting players, but they have
not the stamina of the Australians nor do they
combine so well. In Sydney'last week they were
beaten twice—by a Metropolitan side (4 to 2) and
by an Australian XI which included the Tasmanian
Stoner and the South Australian Cameron (5 to
1). Jim Masters, who captained the Aussies, got
four of the five goals. He has been playing senior
football since he was 16. and there isn’t a finer
centre-forward south of the Line. The veteran was
too tricky for Lau Hing Cheung, the Chinese goal-
keeper, but Lau is a good man nevertheless.
* * * *
H. O. Hopkins, of Adelaide, who was in
the winning Oxford XI this year, had bad luck in
not being in it for three seasons. As a freshman
he was chosen 12th. Last year he was picked, but
was unable to play owing to an injury. This time
he got to the post all right, and helped his side—
badly beaten during the reign of the Ashton
brothers at Cambridge ever since the war—to win
by an innings.
VICTIMS OF OPPRESSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Sydney Pony Owners and Trainers’ Association,
with the support of the jockeys and the sympathy
of the Labor party, is on strike against the pro-
prietary clubs.
Your sympathy ’tis easy to enlist
For wage-plugs groaning ’neath the heavy fist
Of despot profiteers; your quick tears flow
For widows at starvation rates who sew
hi rotting attics, or for lumpers bold
Driven to toil like galley slaves of old.
You weep for sailormen who plough the seas
Harried by mates with kicks and blasphemies.
Have you no tears for these?
These chaps whose brains are stuffed with equine lore,
Who reek of stables from their every pore,
Whose narrow sloping foreheads Horse convey,
Whose very voices sometimes seem a neigh;
These mannikins who from the punters earn
Opprobrium and gratitude in turn —
They’re, after all, but battling for their due,
As you or I might for a rise in screw.
Give them a cheer or two.
Long have they borne intolerable terms,
Only to turn at last, like trodden worms.
No soap-box pleader fires attentive throngs
With pictures of their miseries and their wrongs;
Or tells how oft athirst aricj, starved they go
That bloated pony clubs may roll in dough.
Silent they suffered, but they’re out at last
And with all under-dogs must eke be classed.
Stand fast, brave hearts, stand fast!
With resolution that one’s pulses stirs
They turn upon their tyrant taskmasters.
Should only shearers, miners and the like
Enforce their claims with boycott and with strike?
Not so, nor ever Demos shall endure
The grinding of the faces of the poor,
Whether he toils, th’ oppressed, in dungarees
With humble bowyangs tied below his knees,
Or bravely tailored heads for those resorts
Where now the steed and now the punter snorts.
Dig in your toes, you sports 1

REPRESENTATIVE IN NEW SOUTH WALES:
Messrs. ARMSTRONG-HOLLAND, 4 Bridge St., Sydney, N.S.W.
SEND FOR OUR ILLUSTRATED CATALOGUE No. 20.
THE INKY WAY.
“Geo. Rich”: Here’s candor! In a recent issue
the Kellerberrin (W.A.) Recorder informed its
readers: “The most interesting news will be found
in our advertising columns this week.’’
Pneumonia recently took to the Mornington (Vic.)
Cemetery “Monte” Hassett, who edited the Stawell
News about 15 years ago, and for a decade was at
the helm of the Border Morning Mail at Albury.
“Nollig”: Do these comps do it on purpose? A
Hobart paper recently advertised tenders for the
gazing rights on the" Queen’s Domain, Hobart—the
trysting-plaee for scores of enraptured lovers o’
moonlit nights.
Roy Bridges has deserted the State Parliamentary
and Public Office lobbies to do “inside” work for the
Age. He is in the editorial group, and among
other things is art and literary critic. In his spare
time he will continue to write readable novels.
“P.X.”: In a par the other day mentioning that
Wallace Nelson had taken hold of Sydney’s Theatre
Magazine, it was said that he had once been a
Truth henchman in W.A. You may accuse him of
almost anything else ; but he’ll get annoyed if you
bring that false charge against him.
George B. Davey, Who died lately at Parramatta,
aged 64, began, like many another old-time journalist,
as a comp, on the S. M. Herald. He broke away
from type-snatching early, and for nearly 40 yea vs
he reported and read proofs on papers in the Cum-
berland district. Old Bulletin readers often heard
from him as “Lillipilli.”
G. A. Mating, one of the fledglings admitted to
the Vic. Bar a few days ago, is a son of “Ithuriel,”
who took leave recently of the Argus and the Fed-
eral Parliamentary gallery. His mother is a daughter
of J. 11. Abbott, who sat in the Dreary House from
1889 till his death in 1904, and was hon. Minister
in Patterson’s Cabinet.
“Coot”: An old inky-wayfarer, T. W. Rashleigh,
of Glenferrie (Vic.), had the 50th anniversary of
his wedding the other day. After landing in Mel-
bourne, 68 years ago, he put in 23 years in Bendigo,
rising from apprentice to manager of the Evening
News. A few changes followed, then he settled down
first as manager and later as managing director of
the Spectator, the organ of Vie. Methodists.
“H.H.”: Two of the S. M. Herald’s old inhabi-
tants passed out the other day—Charles Bone after
40 years’, and John Sutherland Small after 61 years’
service. Bone started in the composing-room and
.ended as a reader, but Small stuck to the mechanical
side all along. The fathers of both of them were
Herald employees, and three of Small’s sons have
served an apprenticeship in the ancient printery.
“Loyola”: Apropos “Stories for Children” (R.P.
26/7/’23). Hugh Lofting has been awarded the
John Newbery medal for the most important Ameri-
can contribution to children’s literature for the year
1922, “The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle” being the
medal-winning contribution. The award is made by
the children’s librarians all over the United States.
It seems a solemn sort of proceeding; but possibly
it occasionally establishes a value, permanent or
otherwise.
“Pitmanite”: Ex-Vic. State and Federal Hansard
reporter F. R, Sholl, an Adelaide pressman when
Federation arrived, has thrown up his job of Deputy-
Chief of the Commonwealth reporting staff, Attorney-
General’s Department, to start on his own account
as a professional shorthander. The service will
remember him as a very capable note-taker who was
always willing to help a less experienced man un-
ravel the tangled masses of verbiage so often hurled
at the Bench from the floor of the Arbitration Court.
The second issue of Vision, Australia’s most un-
clothed periodical, is on the market, and is an
improvement on the first. “The Succubus,” a
wickedly humorous study of one who will be recog-
nised by many Sydney artists and journalists, alone
makes the number worth the 3s. 6d. The writer’s
name is given as “Charles Partridge.” but the
mordant hand is surely that of a Lindsay. There
is a good deal of interesting poetry by the editors
—notably Jack Lindsay’s vigorous “Death of Mar-
lowe” —and some stern remarks on “The Liar in
Music” by A. G. Beutler.
“M.D.”: In taking leave of the English Review,
which he has piloted since 1910, and which has
again changed hands, Austin Harrison relates how
the great Australian adjective saved the Review
when it was on the rocks after the Frank Harris
eselandre. It was boycotted by the trade, off
the bookstalls, and burnt over afternoon teacups,
when a dripping man walked into the office, deposited
a bulky MS. and walked out without saying a word.
It was John Masefield with “The Everlasting Mercy,
which had already been turned out by a dozen
shocked editors. The sanguinolent adjective was
repeated 80 times in as many pages. Harrison
chanced it, and the fortune of the Review was made.
“Bill Bowyang”: Here’s some information from &
London literary agent that may be valuable to
free-lance journalists who have an eye on Englisn
periodicals: “The demand now is fairly widespteau
for Romance —in other words, for action stories with
a strong sentimental theme. It is hardly possible to
sell a morbid story, however gripping and well-
written it may be. ‘I do wish you would send me
some decent love stories,’ is an editorial plaint -.hat
I have got almost tired of hearing. Such stories
are the urgent need of the moment. There is a ready
market in England for stories by Australian authors,
provided they are calculated to make a universal
appeal to humanity in general, and are not too Aus-
tralian in atmosphere and 1 in diction to be under-
stood and appreciated by English readers.
“Isola”: “P.X.” (B. 2/8/’23) can take it from me
that a snobbish desire to be considered an English
graduate is not necessarily the reason for the pieva-
lence of English “literature” in Australian doctors
waiting-rooms. In the case of suburban quacks with
a “mixed” practice (private and lodge) an average
of 15 patients call each session—morning, afternoon
and evening. They do not have special appointments,
and they naturally look for periodicals and magazines
to while away the periods of waiting. But the
doctor soon finds that the duller (and frequently
piffling) English mag. will lay on the table till it
is out of date, while the brighter and virile stuff is
pinched. When I float a company to insure profes-
sional men against loss of waiting-room periodicals
by theft I shall load heavily the following bad nsas •
(1) Bulletin ; (2) Saturday: Evening Post (U.b.A.);
(3) Sydney Mail; (4) Adventure (U.S.A.); (&)
Any magazine on gardening. Experientia aocet!
From an article on “Williiam Hughes, former Pre-
mier of Australia, shipowner, politician sugar-king
and all around good fellow*” in the Kansas City
Times (U.S.A.) :
“No more romantic career has ever been recorded
for a successful statesman. He started his earning-
career as an umbrella-mender under a series of handi-
caps. He was deaf, and he stuttered. In his early
days he used his deafness as an excuse to ignore the
hecklers who tried to interrupt him when he spoke
in public, and by using the simple method of placing
a stone in his cheek and watching the contortions of
his face before a mirror he eliminated the impedi-
ment in his speech. .. .During the war he became
Australia’s czar—benevolent, patriotic, seeking no-
thing for himself. He was the public idol. But
utter the war came reaction. Hughes had too long
been on a pedestal. The fickle public desired a new
object of worship and crossed him in one or two of
his plans. ‘I have worked for the public long
enough,’ he declared, and immediately resigned. 11l
stop working for the public a while and work a
little for Bill Hughes.’ And with the enthusiasm
with which he drove through his plans for conscrip-
tion he plunged into the world of finance. U>-day
lie owns a fleet of steamers, acres of farm-lands and
rich mining properties, and literally controls the
Australian sugar-market. But nobody ( charges that,
he profiteers with it. Hughes is now out of office
but not out of power, and wherever lie appears on the
streets is liable to be interrupted in his progress by
a throng of enthusiastic admirers He has far greater
power than any defeated President of the United
States or Premier of England ever has had, save per-
haps in the one case of Theodore Roosevelt.

Allan Wilkie’s return to Sydney drew a
packed and enthusiastic Conservatorium on
Saturday night. The Immortal Bill’s “Win-
ter’s Tale” opened the season; and this,
despite the attraction of a thumping divorce
scene, in which the husband Leontes (Allan
Wilkie) is both plaintiff and judge, was the
first presentation Sydney has seen for years
of this most poetic work. Leontes, King of
Sicilia, isn’t a pleasant person. He accuses
his wife, Hermione (Hunter-Watts), of a
liaison with his greatest friend, Polixenes,
King of Bohemia ; and when that astute bird
remembers how healthy is the open air of
his own country, Leontes takes it out of
Hermione. There’s a Court scene, in which
all the soiled linen of the family gets an
airing, and some back-chat between Leontes,
Paulina (Lorna Forbes —chief witness for
the defendant) and Hermione that would
make a sale for any evening paper.
* * * *
• Miss Hunter-Watts double-banked the
parts of Hermione and Perdita, and was
particularly sparkling as the “Queen of
Curds.” Wilkie’s Leontes was as unpleasant
as it was meant to be, and Augustus Neville’s
Autolycus was a whimsical rogue with a
flexible-speaking voice. Altogether the com-
pany seems an improved combination. Plump-
ton Wilson and Hamilton Henry as the old
shepherd and his oafish son kept in the pic-
ture all the time.
❖ * * *
“Twelfth Night” rollicked on the stage
on Monday night; and Malvolio must now
be ranked as Wilkie’s best part, or there-
abouts. There is a subtlety about this Mal-
volio who is sick of self-love that gives the
actor a chance to displav the fantastic
streak. The final scene between the poor,
cross-gartered wretch and his mistress,
Olivia, is excellent. Malvolio, brought from
his prison, half-deluded into the idea that
he is mad, comes before Olivia, unkempt,
the mail of his self-conceit dented and
pierced, trembling with indignation over the
insults that have been heaped upon him—
he grows, in that moment, so close to being
a man that you are sorry when, with the
recovery of his chain of office, the self-
love rises from the ashes and turns him once
more into the pompous Major Domo. The
parts of Sir Toby and Aguecheek were in
the seasoned hands of Augustus Neville and
Henry Hamilton; and Irene Webb acted
"MARY," AT HER MAJESTY'S,
SYDNEY.
Cecil Keltaway as Mr. Goddard.
up to them as Maria. Miss Hunter-Watts
made a winsome Cesario, and Lorna Forbes
a pretty Olivia. Ellis Irving’s jester caught
the fancy of the house, and his voice in the
old lyrics was pleasing to the ear.
“The Beggar’s Opera” continues to put
back the hands of the clock two full
centuries at the Palace, Sydney. It’s a
mad, glad underworld, Gay’s, and forces one
to the conclusion that the playwright of to-
day is unfairly handicapped. He couldn’t
get material like this out of Bill Warrens
and Squizzy Taylors.
* * * *
The curtain will rise at Her Majesty’s,
Sydney, next Saturday on “The Cabaret
Girl.” It is certified as a bright and melodi-
ous conception, and the well-established favo-
rite Alfred Frith should score another hit.
* # * *
At Sydney Grand Opera House “Bulldog
Drummond” will circumvent the machina-
tions and frustrate the knavish tricks of
his enemies for another nine nights. All
who like their drama well-gingered will carry
away pleasant memories of G. H. Mulcaster.
“Enter, Madame,” is still evoking the glad
laughter of youth and beauty and the quiet
chuckle of age and avoirdupois at Sydney
Criterion. The comedy gives Gertrude
Elliott all the opportunity any actress could
desire to sparkle and to shine.
* * # *
The days of Ruby Norton are numbered,
for on Friday week she will erase her name
from the Sydney
Tivoli programme.
Meanwhile the in-
crease of traffic-
police in Castle-
reagh-street is a
monument to her
popularity. The
Big Four, Bill
Moloney and
Ernest Pitcher
have emulated the
boomerang, and all
are as refreshing
as billy-tea after a
10-mile tramp. And
there is Danny
D’alma with his
troupe of high-
minded, hounds,
and a bunch of
popular veterans.

“Java Head” is
the picture of the.

Strand exhibits it.
The film almost

Money Everything?” For the benefit
of erring hubbies a bony index-finger
is pointed, incidentally, at the shallowness
of the “other woman.” “Quicksands” has
ousted “Souls for Sale” at the Globe. A
Mexican border concoction of rum-running
and revolver-potting, it is sure to thrill —
unless, of course, you live at Surry Hills
or Ultimo. Debating clubs and medical
students are digesting the pros and cons, of
a matter of sawbones etiquette at the
Rialto; and the Hay market has let loose
“The Abysmal Brute” to the joy of the phy-
sical-culturist. “Three Jumps Ahead,” at
Hoyt’s, appears to be a midnight flea-hunt-
ing expedition in a third-class boarding-
house ; “Trifling Women” is proving but a
trifling attraction at the Piccadilly; and
at the Crystal Palace Fairbanks is still dis-
playing masterful restraint in allowing Rich-
ard the Lion Heart to retain the throne of
England.
* * * *
And the Westminster Glee Singers have
taken their captivating melodies from Syd-
ney Town Hall to the capacious Hippodrome.
* * * *
Lydia Lipkovska, who gave her first Mel-
bourne recital at the Town Hall last Satur-
day night (she was probably unlucky in
coming so soon after Evelyn Scoiney’s
matinfie), is an entertainer hard to place.
As regards her third and most fascinating
costume, the one with the crinoline in it,
Madame is like nothing on earth that we
have seen before under the same circum-
stances. Blanche Arral, of old, sang at the
Town Hall after proving something of a
boom in a theatre, but Blanche and her
surroundings differed in all respects from
the fair Lydia’s outfit. The Arral artist
was a petite French lady of limited personal
attractions, whose clever singing was even
more admirable than her soprano voice. She
had an orchestra in front and stage scenery
at the back of her costume recitals, made up
of scenes from operas. Lipkovska, from
Russia, cannot vocalise up to the highest,
or second highest, Australian standard, and
when she sings pianissimo she can hardly
sound very effective to friends at a distance,
though it is all right for the front chairs.
Yet her voice has some beautiful notes, warm
and sympathetic, which made her quite
charming at the outset in the Russian
arrangement of a Chopin study, “Sadness.”
On the other hand, her treatment of the
Bell Song from “Lakme” was not very beau-
tiful in tone or remarkable for anything save
the singer’s suggestion of a bell that wasn’t
silvery. In fact, there was a period in the
Lipkovska recital, staged with an acre of
black cloth to hide the organ gallery and
shut in the sound, when the idea of Madame
giving the whole entertainment, with the
assistance of a pianist, excellent in accom-
paniments but feeble in solo work, and wbo
reverently bent to kiss her hand on one
occasion, seemed somewhat audacious. The
group of songs she sang in an alleged ancient
Russian disguise were not charming. But
the costume with the powdered wig and huge
crinoline in it was associated with French
songs that suited the singer’# voice, style
and beauty. There was a strong appeal in
her concluding cluster of chansons; and she
finished the course like a stayer. To-night
(Thursday) and Saturday the lady of the
crinoline appears again, Friday night at the
Town Hall being devoted to the farewell
concert of Evelyn Seotney.
* sic *
Vance Palmer’s “The Black llofse” was
conspicuous in the Pioneers’ parade of one-
acters at Melbourne Playhouse last week, it
is the striking miniature of a youth who,
though lie considers a morning well lost for
a water-melon, consents to mount a wild
horse in response to his father’s challenging
tilt at his courage. The result is a tragedy,
and its poignancy is deepened by the dark
arresting dialogue and piercing characterisa-
tion. Bryce Dunning played the boy ; George
Dawe whs the father; and Alice Cfowther
effectively pictured the temperament of the
romantic, heart-broken mother. Ruby May,
a capital housekeeper in the playlet, was also
the "bit of skirt” over which Leo Burke and
Reg Moyle broke the deep, out-back silence
m Frank Brown’s “Mates.” The rum-
moistened argument, which fully establishes
the author’s renown as a sporting savant,
was more cheerful and humorous than
Katherine Susannah Prichard’s discourse on
kid-worship entitled “The Great Man.” In
this somewhat pifflesome joke Hilda Bull, as
tne wife, appeared to take its torch-bearing
conclusion as a profound Ibsenish flourish.
The same lady was cast as Mrs. McConachie
in the revival of Stewart Macky’s “The
Trap,” while Charles Doherty, the underdone
father in the* rag-baby episode, did the Bishop
in the repetition of Ernest O’Ferrall’s
“Bishop and the Buns.”
** * *
A full house at Melbourne Royal on Satur-
day gave a roar of greeting to Dennis's
“Sentimental Bloke.” The cast is practi-
cally the same as before, the only notable
change being the appearance of Vivian
Edwards as the spieler who tries to bilk
Uncle Jim. The loss of ’Erb’s forlse teeth
is still a matter for complaint by Leslie
Gordon, but his top note is an octave lower
than Tal Ordell’s soaring yodel as a bunny
merchant. Since he was last in Melbourne
Ordell has manufactured a cry like a
Stadium fan in training. Also, his manner
has grown richer in picturesque suggestion,
his easy competence having developed through
steadfast avoidance of burlesque. Walter
Cornock’s Bill is as good as ever; but hard
practice hasn’t imparted the requisite tarty
warble to the rather hard tones of Eileeii
Alexander. Eileen’s well-meant attempts at
Doreen are flavored with a college-educated
ladylikeness. She walks like a Young Per-
son several floors above Bill in the social
edifice. Iza Crossley continues to regard
Artie (Herbert Walton) as a “trick” and
smack him playfully for his persiflage; as
before, Edward Landor skips from the de-
signing clinches of “Mar” (Stella Pay ter) ;
and Alfreda Bevan’s expertness as -a midwife
is broached in a heavy bluesto.ne fashion on
Bill’s rustic verandah.
At Melbourne Princess’s the prolonged
Last Nights of “Tangerine” were saddened
last week by another absence of May Beatty,
whose understudy has had quite a busy time.
Another defaulter was Alex. McPherson, one
of the unimpressive young men of the wild
romance, whose job fell to a chorister. The
icy fang of winter seems to have bitten the
“Tangerine” co. freely, and some nights the
pervading air of the ornate production is a
bit chilly.
** * *
“Sybil,” at Melbourne Majesty’s, continues
to remind one that Russia used to have
grand dukes and duchesses in the bad old
days before the country went Bolshevik. The
last nights are announced as before, and the
evenings and the matinges are the ninth
week.
As an illustration of how an amiable
British diplomat can be insulted by an abom-
inable clique of wowsers in his brother’s
domicile, the story of “His House in Order”
interests critical visitors to Melbourne
King’s. The reception of Dion Boucicauli
when he greets the Ridgeley family with a
cheery “Good morning, everybody,” is a ;
study in grim respectability’s worst form. It
is hard to think the pugnacious unpleasant-
ness of the Ridgeleys possible of anybody
living in highly-civilised society. But maybe
an exception should be made in the case of
a family whose acknowledged head wears a
patriarchal beard and answers to the name
of Daniel.
“ ROCKETS ,” AT MELBOURNE
PALACE.
Toots Pounds and Arthur Lucas sing songs
of Old London.
“Rockets” keeps the crowd moving towards
Melbourne Palace. Nothing has changed.
Even the bright warble of Toots Pounds con-
tinues to be sometimes off the note, and the
singing of Arthur Lucas is likewise un-
certain.
❖ ❖ Jfc &
Hoyt’s spread of fiction in Melbourne this
week includes “The Dinkum Bloke,” with
C. J. Dennis’s original Bloke and Doreen,
Arthur Touchert and Lottie Lyell, in the
principal parts. The film is Australian, and
the production is another plume in the
already feathered cap of Raymond Long-
ford. Joseph Hergesheimer’s fine story,
“Java Head,” has been squeezed of every-
thing but the literary essence for the chief
picture on Hoyt’s Gaiety programme.
“Golden Dreams,” the prevailing nightmare
at the Majestic, is from the Zane Grey fac-
tory, and is novel in using a menagerie as
a mob-dispellant in a terrible situation.
“More to be Pitied than Scorned” is both
the title and the criticism of the second
attraction, which shows a lot of affection
running to waste. “Who Are My Parents?”
has started a guessing competition at the
Melba; and feminine envy is exploited in
“Poor Men’s Wives,” the latest five-reeler at
the Britannia.

A one-man show in Melbourne: —
Victor Zelman’s art, as revealed at Miss McLean’s
rooms, 125 Collins-street, is an agreeable surprise.
To be sure, he hasn’t altogether lost a tendency to
prettiness, but that he is gaining a grip of his craft
and is beginning to paint landscape with a shrewder
understanding of atmosphere and color is manifest
in several pictures. One gets a very good example
of his work in “The Last Load,” wherein the salieni
fact of the straining horses doesn’t lure attentior
from the capital sky and background. The sky in
“Black Soil” is given a rather ponderous significance,
but the ploughed earth and surrounding country arc
presented with charming veracity. The quiet beauty
and serenity of “The Quince Orchard” and the deft-
ness of a breezy little impromptu which has been
secured by Bernard Hall are equally taking, and the
green fields and simplicity of a “Spring Morning’
would make even a hardware drummer poetical. The
larger subjects, “Rising Mists” and “Gums at Sil-
van,” are not without merit, but are wanting in the
sincerity noticeable in the smaller efforts. ,

Harry Lauder has gone to Westralia by
way of Port Pirie and Port Augusta (S.A.).
His Adelaide season showed him a great
artist, mellowed by time. He had the audi-
ences hysterical with the simplest humor,
yet had not the ordinary comedian’s diffi-
culty in getting them to take him seriously.
On the contrary, when he came to the foot-
lights and talked straight about a possible
future war, he had a hushed house hanging
on every word. He has a passable support-
ing co.; and, as Lauder gathers in many
people who never see variety shows, even
hackneyed things went well. The Prince
of Wales’s has closed for the present, but
variety still goes well at the Majestic, where
Ward and Sherman fill half the programme,
and the Krakes do some acrobatic work that
is humorous as well as clever. Pictures are
powerful and good, with “The Prisoner of
Zenda” at the York, and Fairbanks’s athletic
version of “Robin Hood” at West’s; also,
Agnes Ayres scores at Wondergraph as the
usual heroine who takes the place of a de-
faulting jockey, but at the wheel of a racing
motor this time. And “Sally” is just com-
ing in to brighten things up at the Royal.

“T. 0.1.”: A propos Dion Boucieault (B.
16/8/’23), the family name was Boursiquot.
There were two brothers in business at
Dublin in the early twenties of last century :
John, a silk mercer in Upper Sackville-street,
EXCUSING HIM.
THE FAIR CRITIC : "Now is it that you
nearly always paint the same scenery?
Oh, of course —I had forgotten how
fares have risen.”
and Saul, a merchant in Jervis-street. I
do not know for certain which was the father
of Dion; I think Saul. Dion was born in
Dublin on Boxing Day, 1822, and was edu-
cated under his guardian, Dr. Lardner, of
Trinity College, and at London Uni. He
produced his first play, “London Assurance,”
in 1841, at Covent Garden. He went to the
States in 1853 and remained seven years; it
Was there he married Agnes Robertson.
“0.K.” on Melbourne playgoers:—
The success of the Vanbrugh-Boucicault Co. with
“His House in Order” is an interesting sign of the
times. Among the people who talk of shows and
show-folk in railway carriages and tram cars little
or nothing is said about the play at Melbourne
King’s. They continue to discuss entertainments
with music and dancing in them, expressing the
usual “love” for Gladys Moncrieff, Mamie Watson,
“Rockets” and so forth. You don’t hear them talk
of going, or having gone, to the non-musical show
at the King’s. Patrons of the Pinero play are those
who preserve silence or speak in whispers. They come
as a reminder that even the local world is a pretty
large place. The crowd that rushed the first production
of “The Sign of the Cross” contained a large leaven
of ordinary playhouse public, interspersed among
unsophisticated inquirers, young and old. It was
the first time in a theatre for many of them. In
the case of “His House in Order” the special attrac-
tion is for such as have either tired of musical
comedy and revue stuff or severely refrained from
seeing it. And old folk go to compare it with the
Brough and Boucieault productions of 30 years ago,
and try to persuade themselves it is quite as well
done —which it isn’t.
“J.F.H.”: In a letter to a London press
pal, Oscar Asche reports that business in Aus-
tralia has been “very good,” but exes, have
eaten hugely into the profits. They have, he
says, increased 200 p.c. since he toured Aus-
tralia in 1912. Oscar singles out Perth for
special compliments, the Westralian metro-
polis having poured £ll,OOO into his treasury
in three weeks. “And the population is only
65,000,” he adds. But that isn’t what the
census-taker reported in 1921.
“McNorth”: Disciples of George Bernard
Shaw, vegetarian, non-smoker and non-
drinker, will be shocked to hear that the
master is a licensed victualler. In front of
Shaw’s English country residence there is a
small pub which some time ago a wealthy
syndicate proposed buying and transforming
into a six-storeyed hydro. As such a building
threatened to shut out Shaw’s favorite view
of the countryside, besides bringing to the
district mobs of undesirable Philistines, the
playwright got in ahead of the syndicate
and bought the unpretentious old tavern. But
the law demanded that he keep the license
going; wherefore there appears above the
door the legend :
GEORGE BERNARD SHAW,
Licensed to Retail Spirituous Liquors.
“J.F.H.” (Lond.) : The Times has been
giving a leg-up to the Maoriland drama. Re-
viewing three of Alan E. Mulgan’s plays, it
says they are “full of promise,” and that
Muigan has discovered “dramatic values in
the strictly colonial conditions around him.”
“The Daughter,” w<e are told, presents a
highly dramatic contrast between the early.
life of a woman passed amid gracious and
cultured surroundings and her subsequent
career as a hard worker on an M.L. farm ;
and in the reviewer’s opinion “the plays
would certainly act well, and would stand
transplantation to the home country.” Which
is something for Australian and M.L. man-
agers to put in their pipes.
“Lud”: Hugh Ward’s next offering will
be the farcical comedy “Tons of Money,”
which has been running in London since
Apifil, 1922. Written by Will Evans, the
vaudeville comedian, and a music-hall song-
writer who calls himself Valentine, it was
turned down by every manager of note. Put
up tentatively by a syndicate headed by Aus-
tralia’s old friend Tom Walls, it was a hit
from the start.
“Peter”: Barring the graceful little nip-
pers in “The Blue Bird,” and some infant
prodigies in pantomime, I cannot recall a
single stage child that I didn’t want to
wrench off the stage and spank. Lately my
feelings have been lacerated by two stage
juveniles—-the small boy (or girl) who was
supposed to be the result of the amour in
“Woman to Woman,” and the superior little
brat who is now cheeking his elders in "1118
House in Order.” Possibly such kids are
to be found off-stage, but the high artificial-
ity of their tones in speaking the most ordi-
nary commonplaces, the F,auntleroyish graces
of their behavior and their hideous air of
precocity make me want to smack them
soundly. Some sardonic critic remarked the
other day that “the trouble with child-actors
is that they die after their time”—a brutal
sentiment, maybe, but reflecting in a convex-
mirror sort of way the feelings of a consider-
able population.
“Q.Q.Q.”: The three obsolete instruments
now making music for “The Beggar’s Opera”
are a reminder that the piano made its stage
debut in England in this same play. It was
in May, 1767, at the Theatre Royal, Covent
Garden, when the performance was for the
benefit of Miss Brickler, who played the part
of Polly Peachum. “Miss Brickler,” the
programme announced, “will sing a favorite
song from ‘Judith’ accompanied by Mr. Dib-
din on a new instrument called Piano Forte.”
It was in 1690 that Bartolomeo Cristofali, a
harpsichord maker of Padua, evolved the
pianoforte, but it was not till some 70 years
later that England heard it. Burkhard
Tschudi, an ex-joiner, did the introducing.
“Whitebait”: C. M. Hallard, who is doing
Filmer Jesson in “His House in Order”
at Melb. King’s, ought to be pretty well
practised in the part, for he has played it in
London, America and S’Africa. Hallard
is the son of an Edinburgh judge, and started
with Frank Benson in “The School for
Scandal.” Subsequently he joined Beerbohm
Tree, acting Gecko in the original run of
“Trilby,” and taking on Laertes to the
great man’s Hamlet. Hallard has many
curious reminiscences of the stage. He can
remember seeing Pinero as the Demon King
in a far-off panto.
“E.T.”: Harking back to Albert Chevalier
and the melodies of his songs (B. 26/7/’23)»
the most famous —“My Old Dutch,” “The
Narsty Way ’E Sez It” and “Knocked ’Em
in the Old Kent Road”—were composed by
his brother Auguste, known as Charles Ingle,
who also acted as “Chivvy’s” manager. But
the great little artist had many musicians
to set his words during his career, amongst
them being Mel. B. Spurr, the entertainer,
who died in Australia; Edward Jones, best
known by the incidental music in “The Sign
of the Cross,” and John Crook, who was
conducting here a quarter of a century ago.
Two of Crook’s inspirations (I use the word
advisedly) were “The Coster’s Serenade”
(“Dahn at the Welsh’Arp, w’ich is ’Endon
way”) and “’Appy ’Ampstead.” Chevalier
himself—he had a nice taste in music and
was a violinist of merit, though he never
fiddled in public—was responsible for the
simple little tunes married to “The Coster’s
Courtship” (“An’ Sally answers ‘Ymss’ ”)
and “Mrs. ’Enery ’Awkins,” and how per-
fectly they suited the words!
HER LINE OF BUSINESS.
VADDEVILLE AGENT (reading card): “ Mystico?—what is
your line?”
APPLICANT : “I dress in male attire and defy the audi-
ence to name my sex.”
“C. Ockney”: A Poverty Pointer recalls
the ancient music-hall song “Lend Me a
Cab-fare, Ducky.” His par took me back to
the London Pavilion of the nights when a
flushed chairman officiated at a table in the
centre of the hall, and when Arthur Roberts,
singer of that delectable ditty, was the spoilt
darling of the variety stage—spoilt, in the
sense that his audiences permitted him to
chortle rhymes that were nothing if not
near the knuckle. In the chorus of this
particular old-timer the vocalist describes
his meeting with a lady in Piccadilly at mid-
night, the lady Remarking inter alia:
Oh, lend me a cab-fare, ducky,
Oh, do now, there’s a dear!
Or buy me a hot potato,
I feel so awfully queer.
Your eyes look dreadfully wicked,
But kissing I couldn’t allow ;
I might have done so a few months ago,
But I’m living with mother now!
Roberts is still on deck, and the Pav. stands
where it did, but the chairman and “drinks
in the auditorium” have long since departed.
“Phil Cowan”: “Mancam’s” acquaintance
with Albert Chevalier as an entertainer (B.
16/8/’23) must have been slight if he
doesn’t remember the Chelsea Pensioner or
yokel impersonations. The yokel was por-
trayed as a fatuous chump. “Oi ’ears what
Oi ’ears, and Oi knows what Oi knows; but
yer can’t taake a roise out of Oi.” Cheva-
lier found his characters in almost every
walk of life. When I saw him at the Lon-
don Coliseum his last item was a pompous
but accommodating vicar, who invites the
“ladies of the ballet” to attend his church
bazaar, considering what the function lost
in tone it would gain in funds. In the tra-
ditional throaty voice he told us “When
charity’s the mor-el, We should never pick
a quar-rel. No, we welcome everyone at
Our Bazaar.”
“Norbell” : But Alf Woods wasn’t ruined,
as alleged by “Uloola,” through King Hedley
selling him a dog in the shape of one of
Bland Holt’s copyrighted plays(B. 16/8/’23).
Woods was rehearsing “For England” at
Sydney Majesty’s, re-naming it “Called to
Arms,” and Holt was playing at the Royal.
An actress of Woods’s co. called to see Mrs.
Holt one day, and showed that lady her splen-
did part in the “new” piece, and the fat was
in the fire. I was in court when Bland Holt
applied for an injunction. The whole thing
was over in an hour, so the costs couldn’t
have hurt Woods much. Besides, he was
running two big cos. at the time; he didn’t
crack up financially till later on. Moreover,
Woods never said King Hedley was the vil-
lain of the piece. He blamed two others
now dead.
“Abbot Park”: Melbourne first saw “The
Beggar’s Opera” at the Royal in 1855. Cap-
tain Macheath was impersonated by Madame
Carandini and Polly Peachum by Sara
Flower; G. H. Rogers was Peachum, and
R. H. Horne Mat. C. H. Lavenu, noted as
a conductor and ’cellist, was an unexpected
success as Filch. At the Royal in 1861
Lady Don appeared as Macheath, with Miss
Mortimer as Lucy Locket and Searle as
Filch. This production was a rank failure.
“S.T.S.”: Mysterious are the doings of the
film censorship. One guesses at its under-
ground work in a film now showing, “More
to be Pitied than Scorned.”
The heroine was wrongly re-
ported dead, and her husband
has innocently married her
rival. The villain still pursues
her, proposing not unreason-
ably that she shall now marry
him, but, rejected with scorn
and motioned to the door, he
turns back and speaks. The
talk has been profusely re-
ported up till now, but here the
screen becomes coyly silent.
Evidently what the gentleman
said was so awful that the cen-
sors have cut it out. The ani-
mated conversation one sees
following is in dumb show, and
meaningless. When the screen
becomes articulate again, the
heroine is asking for “time to
consider,” and a few feet later
she is seen fleeing from her
home “in consequence of his
threats.” They must have been
literally unspeakable.
“Caesar’s Ghost” : The world’s
champion in the deadhead de-
partment was unwittingly dug
up by Alec Anderson, the
advance agent. He made his
appearance at the Victoria
Theatre, Westport (M.L.),
with a card endorsed, “Admit
Mr. Grab and family.—-A.A.”
Behind him were Mrs. Grab and
13 young Grabs, all steps and
stairs. An agitated doorkeeper
having vouched for their being
bona-fide Grabs, the 15 filed to
their seats past a nearly-faint-
ing staff; but the business-
manager surpassed himself when he learned
the full extent of Grab’s services to the com-
pany. Grab had refused money payment for
a bucket of paste.
“Abbot Park”: Regarding Nellie Stewart,
can any old-timer remember her as Radi-
anta in “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star,”
the Melb. Royal panto, in 1873? The other
two Stewart girls and Father Richard were
also in the show; it was during 1 pa’s part-
nership with Harwood, Hennings and Cop-
pin. Greville figured as the Dame, and
recently-deceased Harry Leston as Dick, the
Big Boy. John Forde, versatile always,
impersonated a character called Hurricane
and shook a leg in the Double Harlequinade,
led by the Duvalli sisters. In the following
year Nellie played Emmeline in the J. C.
Williamsons’ production of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” j
Willie Maher, of Melbourne, writes re
Robert Brough (B. 2/8/’23 ) :
Tell “Histrionicus” that I saw Brough do the
name-part in “Tambour Major” about June, 1885,
and a rare mess he made of it. Edwin Kelly, who
came after Fred Mervin, made a better Major.
“Mancam”: “H.E.R.’s” par. about the
rheumatic corpse who came to life again to
predict rain (B. 16/8/’23) reminds me. We
were presenting “Steeped in Crime” at
Walkaway, and our guv’nor, who was a bit
of a martinet, had been instructing the local
pianist in the right performance of the
agitatos, tremolos and pizzicatos incidental
to the drama. They rehearsed all the after-
noon, and just doubts pursued the boss all
the evening. When he fell dead in the last
act, no sympathetic strains accompanied his
passing. The corpse revived sufficiently to
roll down stage a bit and hiss at the scared
pianist, “Music, you blanky statue!”
THE HERO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The rooster’s sanitation to the dawn
How good to hear, when snugly tucked in bed ;
The rosy sky, the dewdrops on the lawn,
I take as read.
The rising sun gives to the grateful world
A smile benign ;
Well underneath the eiderdown I’m curled—
I let him shine.
Along the beach where the white horses play,
And freshening breezes whistle o’er the sand,
As men and maidens face the stinging spray— 1
Ah, life is grand!
I’d thrill to hear the soaring seagulls screech
Above the strife;
But would I join those idiots on the beach?
Not on your life!
Hair-raising dangers merely make me smile,
I laugh at risks which others terrify ;
I beard the lion, dare the crocodile,
Death I defy ;
In moving accidents by flood and field
I simply revel—
Movie j I mean. Where feature films are reeled
I am a devil.
When war’s fierce fireworks set the world ablaze,
And duty called, I felt a virtuous glow ;
The valor of our heroes won my praise—•
I bade them go !
Their conduct made me prouder of my kind ;
Ah ; Who can doubt it ?
I purchased every paper I could find
To read about it.
Let poets watch the morning sunlight fleck
The dew-drenched, sloppy lawns—it makes ’em
write.
Let surfers freeze, Doug, gaily risk his neck,
Let fight;
Three good square meals —a bed—sufficient beer
To stay my thirst —
’Tis all I ask. To one rule I adhere,
This —Safety First.

PAIGE'JEWETT
A Declared Full Six Cylinder
UTOR cars, like men, must take a definite stand, and be
IVI either fish or flesh. If it be a four cylinder, let it be a
good one. If a six cylinder, let it be a good one and a full one.
A light six is just an apology wavering between a poor four
and a poor six, not having the courage of its convictions —
the motor car is built accordingly.
We declare of the Paige-Jewett, that it is a full six with all
the full power of six cylinders, with all the flexibility of a
six cylinder, with all the rigid construction of a good six
cylinder at the price of a good four cylinder.
Investigate the Paige-Jewett. Arrange for a trial run. After
your investigation, you will discover the reason why from a
standingstart Paige-Jewett 501d30,000 motor cars thefirstyear.

The Missing Pearls.
(By "HLOX.")
my pearls, my precious mascot.
The necklet was given me by a
Roumanian prince, and I never
make a first-night appearance unless wearing
it.”
Miss St. Julian, the celebrated English
actress an Australian management had been
fortunate in securing for a season, had only
arrived in Sydney the day before, with other
members of the company, and was making
her Sydney debut that evening. When she
retired for the night she watched her maid
put the precious pearls away. In the morn-
ing they w T ere gone.
To the suggestion that her maid had taken
them Miss St. Julian turned a deaf ear. She
trusted Marie as she would her own sister,
A notice telling of the missing pearls and
the reward offered for them was posted up
in the hotel. The head detective had just
remarked that it waS one of the most baf-
fling cases he had met, when a hotel guest
came along with the startling information
that in the dead of night he had seen a very
beautiful woman tiptoe into Miss St.
Julian’s room, and just as noiselessly tiptoe
out again with something in her hand. To
the detective’s inquiry as to what he himself
was doing awake at that hour of the night,
he explained that the night being insufferably
hot, he had left his door open, and he had
seen the vision from his bed.
“Would you know her again?”
“Certainly, she had a wealth of golden
hair, a perfect complexion, and soulful grey
eyes. Sin—sh. There she is.”
“Miss Mountfoid, I believe?” inquired the
detective. “This is Mr. Vernon. He tells me
that he saw you steal into Miss St. Julian’s
room about midnight.”
Miss Mountford laughed merrily.
“This is no laughing matter,” the detective
reminded her. “Were you in Miss St.
Julian’s room about midnight?”
“Yes.”
“What for?”
“To borrow something. Miss St. Julian
was asleep! so I took it.”
“Took what?”
“Oh, I’ll explain that little matter to Miss
St. Julian herself when I see her.”
“You know her pearls are missing?”
“Good heavens! You surely are not hint-
ing that I took them.”
“Well, there’s the circumstantial evidence,
and many a person has been convicted on
that. Miss St. Julian swears by her maid’s
honesty, and the hotel management swears
by its staff.”
“If the imputation were not so preposter-
ous, I should say you were insulting me.”
Miss St. Julian then came to the door to
inquire if there were any • developments.
“Oh, you’re there, Ida,” she remarked to
Miss Mountford. “Assisting the detectives
I presume.”
“Well, the detective and this gentleman
have as good as told me that I took the
pearls.”
“Nonsense.”
“But Miss Mountford acknowledges steal-
ing quietly into your room about midnight.”
“I went in to borrow something.”
“What did you borrow?” asked the detec-
tive, eyeing her critically.
“I know,” said Miss St. Julian, “that
my tin of mercolized wax is missing, as well
as my pearls.”
“That’s what I borrowed, and your tin of
stallax as well, because my dressing-case has
been mislaid. I knew you wouldn’t mind.”
“Of course not, but I did miss the merco-
lized wax after my bath.”
“Yvhat is mercolized wax and what is
stallax?” asked the detective.
“Mercolized wax,” replied Miss St. Julian,
“is that wonderful preparation with which
we actresses regain our youthful com-
plexions. It does this by harmlessly remov-
ing the old, worn-out skin, thus enabling the
new skin underneath to show up. Stallax
we use as a shampoo to keep our hair beauti-
ful.”
“Dear me, that’s very interesting. But
you see what an invidious position it has
put you into, Miss Mountford. You’ve got
to prove to the satisfaction of the iaw that
you did not take the pearls at the same time
that you took —er —borrowed the mercolized
wax and stallax. You must not leave this
office until the mystery has been cleared up.”
“Then I am under arrest. It’s monstrous.”
Miss St. Julian was wanted in another
direction. Other detectives had been follow-
ing up another clue. The housemaid who
attended to Miss St. Julian’s room and a
porter in the hotel were soon to be married
and leave for San Francisco. Their respec-
tive rooms had been searched, but nothing
had been found. Still, Detective Murphy
wasn’t satisfied. He again visited the girl’s
room.
“Why did you give the pearls to Jenkins?”
he asked her.
“I didn’t give the pearls to Mr. Jenkins,”
she replied defiantly.
Murphy never took his eyes off the girl,
and presently her eyes wandered to a boot-
shelf in the room. Murphy lifted up the
boots, and several of the pearls which had
been unstrung dropped from the boots to
the floor. “Are all the pearls here?” he
asked.
“Yes, every one, and Mr. Jenkins knows
nothing about my taking them,” cried the
girl, sobbing violently.
“I arrest you in the King’s name, Beatrice
Turner.”
The head detective apologised to Miss
Mountford, and at the same time advised
her not to again borrow toilet preparations
from a friend on the same night that her
jewels are stolen. — Advt.

Fairplay : If you honestly believe that the
Northern Territory should be sold to Japan for the
price of the national debt, you’ve got the vivid imagi-
nation of a frog. But why not sell Queensland?
That would probably suit Japan much better —and
Australia just as we 11.... Dardanelles: Turkey went
broke in 1881, and was still broke at the start of
the war. Nearly two-thirds of the debt was owing
to France; Germany’s little lot was half as much
again as J. 8u11’5.... Gunner: Now, why didn't you
write your “article’’ like you wrote your covering-
letter—simply, directly and with the personal touch
in it that alone makes such things worth while ?. . . .

J. (Rddfern) : A rhyme here and there won’t carry

idea of what a poet’s task might be if you think an
electric current grander than human emotion....
R.W.C.: The storm rages to no purpose... .R. de W.:
Not nearly well enough written... .Mombak: The
awful combat and its awful sequel have an awful
charm :
With all their might the brothers were
Arguing, calling each other mongrel cur,
Till one with upraised arm smote
His brother fiercely on his throat!
Up he rose from his chair
And caught his brother by the hair,
And shook him till his false teeth
Came rattling down underneath.
With awful oaths the brothers fought
And fiercely each other's throat caught;
As slowly they surged around the room
Till with awful crack tripped over the broom,
one freeing himself with awful oath,
Drawing their knifes they both
Tried their best in combat fierce
With deadly purpose other's heart to pierce.
Till one with awful force
Stretched tile other a lifeless corpse.
“O God!’’ he said, “I’ve been to blame,
And now I’ve committed the sin of Cain.”
And so his grievous sin to hide.
He then committed suicide.
. ...8.5.A.: Just the old first smoking adventures,
only a trifle less emotional than usual.... C.B. (Nel-
son) : Too weak to walk. . . .Baanah: You stick in one
rhyme to about six lines, and go plodding 0n....
K. : Far off.. . .Uncle Torn: One lovely line: “Her
eyes would th’ swain's brain addle.” Give us some
more like that... .Hollig: Not bright enough even
for a shocking example.... W.B. (Darlinghurst):
Dreary.... A. ITT.: Highly moral, but rubbish all the
same.... Mary L,: Goes as heavily as one of George
Fuller's explanations. .. .R.C.8.8.: You couldn’t do
much worse than that. .. . J.8.L.: It has an exceptional
number of perfectly good rhymes ; but what’s all the
rhyming about ?... Maco: The “Dirty Dog” is only a

the earth” and “of the spring” in two successive lines ?

crude, and goes at a wearisome jig-jog... .F.G. (or
some other disguised initials) : The complaint in poor
verse that some local magistrates are lenient is ro
good here... .W.K.K.: Wants a different finish....
D.A.J.: Neither quite arrives.... Reg K.: Mostly
poorly written picture-show stuff... .M.P.O. If there

the “rolling plains” or the “mountains wild and

sonnet... .Eardn: “Soapy” is too machine-made....
lI.D. (Vic.) : You have a poor idea of verse-writing.
. . . .Gadfly: The verse isn’t bad, but it has no point.
.... A.McIv.E.: Not good enough.... Haka: Don’t
care for it. ... J.H.C.G.: Misses; but you’ll probably
score a hit presently.... Tom E.: A patchwork of
well-worked phrases that in the aggregate don’t mean
much.... Molly R.: You paraphrase a newspaper
statement in short, lengths of prose which make a
poor effort to resemble verse.. . .M.E.C.: It plods
along like an old horse in deep mud....R.K. (Mos-
man) : All far too rough. .. .Prodigal: The yarn won’t
do. .. .Julie D.: Words —acres and acres of words.
... .1.M.D.: Not enough in them... .Winifred L.:

The Belting that Serves You
Longest—Serves You Best.
Inefficiency in driving qualities of a belt—loss of power through slippage
and friction —will rapidly wear out any belt. Other things being equal, the
belt which wears longest is that which does its work best. The many records
of ten, fifteen or twenty years of service of
PIONEER LEATHER BELTS
are evidence of its working efficiency no less than its wearing qualities.
Minimise your expenditure on belting repairs and renewals by specifying
Pioneer Leather Belting for every drive.
The belt illustrated is an 18in. i>-ply Pioneer Leather Belt in Messrs. James
Barnes, Ltd., Linseed Oil Mills, Alexandria, N.S.W. It has been in constant
use on the same drive for more than twenty years, for the past five years
giving 24 hours a day service.
Manufactured only by

SPLIT BELT PULLEYS
are so unique in construction that they allow of less and lighter material, yet
combine a strength that enables them to carry a much heavier load in comparison
with the usually accepted ratio of riveted or built-up pulleys.
Not too heavy for lightest loads at high speeds, yet sufficiently strong to transmit
maximum loads on normal drives at reasonable belt speeds.
Accurate balancing and rivetless construction also mean savings in wear and tear
of belts, machines and bearings.

“Jackeroo”: Recently I visited Hugh
McMartin’s selection at Pullen Vale, about
10 miles from Brisbane (Q.). Here are
15 acres under cotton, and the rows are
scrupulously clean of weeds, notwithstanding
that the crop is growing on a ridge with
burnt timber lying about. The selector told
me he had solved the problem by turning his
crossbred sheep into the patch; and so far
the jumbucks haven’t tackled the plants.

“Chris”: Looking for a clothes-prop?
Here’s a pine log might do —it’s lying on
the bank at Warren and Feeney’s mill, Hari-
hari, on the west coast of M.L.’s South Island.
Length, 36ft.; diameter at butt, 7ft.; dia-
meter at top, 6ft. It contains about 9000 ft.
of timber, log measurements, and the esti-
mated yield is about 7000 ft., mostly clean
heart.

“0.K.”: Profiteering in rentals in Mel-
bourne must have nearly attained its summit
at a little teashop whose landlord has mul-
tiplied his original exaction by seven.
The odd thing is that while nearly
everybody would invoke the aid of the
law against a Metropolitan Gas Co., and
the same law claims a right to limit the
rapacity of Jew and Gentile money-lenders,
the public has no sort of protection against
the Jews and Gentiles who lend out shop
properties at unconscionable interest on the
monish invested in them. Why there should
be regulation of pizness in which the public
need not engage, but no sort of regulation
of that in which they must engage if they
would do pizness, beats me.
* * * *
“Caveman”: Besides being uninterested in
seaweed, Australian scientists are nonchalant
about the juice exuded from the banana plant.
In most parts of its structure the banana
contains moisture which makes practically
indelible stains varying from cab-rank color
to violent heliotrope. The deep violet and
bluish colors once caused a savant of my
acquaintance to formulate a theory that the
ages-lost royal purple of Tyre and Rome had
been obtained from banana plants brought
from eastern Asia. A German investigator
was on the Tweed River (N.S.W.) early in
1914 doing something with fresh-cut banana-
stalks —-he may have been looking for dyeing
material —but his secret, if he had one, van-
ished with him to the Fatherland when the
rush started.
* * * *
“Mendelian”: The slow and cumbersome
horse-and-cart of the outer-suburban orchard-
ist, poultry-farmer and market-gardener
goes out. Hundreds of these men have been
in the habit of taking 10, 12 and even 24
hours to get a load of produce to market and
return with a load of manure, fodder, mer-
chandise or empties. Instead of leaving
home at dusk of one day, and returning at
dusk next day per horse-and-cart, the pro-
ducer, or the rep. of a syndicate of producers,
can leave early in the morning, catch the
market, pick up return loading and be back
for dinner. It means more rest, less cost
and risk and more time for real cockying.
As a side-line one lorry-owner puts seats on
his ’bus., and collects a fiver every Sunday
for taking a select two-up school out of
range of passers-by and police.

“H.K.” : Mention of the tea-growing trials
carried out over 30 years ago by the N.S.W.
and Queensland Governments (B. 2/8/’23j
recalls that ’way back in 1866 an old-
time pa ; r of Melbourne botanists, Von Muel-
ler and Dr. Williams, entertained directly
opposite views on the possibility of growing
tea locally. The latter condemned the pro-
ject solely on climatic grounds. Whereupon
Dr. Mueller introduced tea seeds from Hong
Kong and raised a number of plants in the
Melbourne Botanic Gardens. He later pro-
posed to form a plantation at Mount Mace-
don, but whether he actually embarked on
this undertaking I can’t say. Incidentally,
a Bulletin par of about four years ago
cited one James Griffiths as having proved
that the tea plant could be successfully culti-
vated in Victoria. Is any further informa-
tion available about this worthy’s activities?
* * * *
“Kip”: The Maltese never were much
good for anything strenuous, but they have
few equals at running a canteen. Their
familiarity with barrack life in their own
little isle probably accounts for their natu-
ral proficiency at this job; you will find
them juggling cigarettes and chocolates be-
hind a narrow strip of a counter almost
the whole world over. In Australia they
have concentrated on the R.A.N.: practi-
cally without exception all the little cup-
board-like canteens on H.M.A. ships are
managed by these olive-skins. This field of
commerce is, of course, not a large one;
but not long after Giuseppe dumps his bluey
on Circular Quay he finds himself in an
H.M.A. ship as an understudy to experi-
enced cousin Giovanni; and as soon as he
becomes proficient in doling out change to
the exacting “matelots” he is considered
qualified to run a business ashore.
* * * *
“Randolph Rentless”: In a city that is
always tearing up its streets strange things
can happen. The other week, not a furlong
from the Sydney railway station, an urban
snuatter settled down at the entrance of a
lane opening on a busy street. With a
couple of lengths of corrugated-iron, very
dilapidated, some timber and some sacking,
he nade himself a lean-to shack against a
wall, big enough to hold a bunk. The second
day of occupation he had a makeshift brazier
installed near him ; later I saw him grilling
chops over it. The policeman on his beat
sometimes paused to have a yarn. Like
everybody else, he put down the camper for
a watchman set to guard the plant and tools
that were being used in some excavation
work hard-by. It was only when that job
was finished that the cop began to ask ques-
tions, and then there was a prompt scatter.

“LEFT SITTING.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Of all sad words of tongue or pen
These most depress. I wonder when,
To slake the mental thirst of one
For things determined —settled—done—
Avenging Time will find it fitting
To get beyond that bar, “Left Sitting.”
At five I buy the Evening Shout ;
With fevered hands I open out
And read the Parliament’ry-page
Reports of party strife and rage.
I skip the rhetoric and skite,
Abuse and challenges to fight.
Here’s a no-confidence debate!
Does Bruce still wear the spats of state ?
What’s happened to the So-so Bill?
Does Dooley lead the party still?
Or is he impotently gritting
His teeth, or does McGirr “Left Sitting.”
To higher things I turn my mind,
Some spiritual salve to find.
The “Council of the Churches” sits
To take dogmatic creeds to bits
And all unite. Will they agree?
Here are the speeches, let us see:
“A vision grand, a pious hope,”
“A spiritual brand of dope,”
“The time not ripe.” With eyebrows knitting
1 seek the end. Just so!—“Left Sitting.”
Next column is the legal news.
Who s winner? Who’s condemned to lose
And pay the heavy costs, of course,
Of that long action for divorce?
Hope in this case faints by the way—
The column’s headed “Twentieth Day.”
It tells how someone’s case was shaken,
How points were made, objections taken;
Some cross-talk, of the futile sort;
How Mr. Bluff addressed the Court.
I know the time-worn end befitting—
“ Adjourned” it is, or else “Left Sitting.”
And every case is much the same,
They “take new grounds,” amend the claim.
One argued that, contended this,
And much more I would gladly miss.
At times, as proof of legal fitness,
They halt the talk and call a witness.
Then Mr. Fees, with great discernment,
Claims a surprise, demands adjournment;
Argues it, steady as a rock,
And gains his, point—at four o’clock.
My hope is - gone that dimly burned;
This, for a change, is just “Adjourned.”
On that dread day when they all wait,
While Peter lines them at the gate,
Statesman and barrister and judge,
Tq learn their fate —if down to trudge,
Or upward fly—as once on earth
Each man “shows cause” for all he’s worth
With tireless jaw, methinks I hear,
Proclaimed to legions far and near
By messengers from Zion’s hill,
Through golden trump and clarion shrill,
The daily bulletin ear-splitting,
“No judgment yet—the Court Left Sitting!”
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
BILL O’ COSTS.
Bushie” : My entry for the Juvenile
Division of the Heavyweight Stakes is the
son of a butcher at Toronto (N.S.W.). The
lad is eight years old and weighs lOst. 41b.
“Perdix”: There’s a lively old spark at
Dilydale, on the north-east coast of the
Speck, Proctor by name, who, at the age of
73 years, is an active motor-cyclist. A
wheelwright by trade, he recently replaced his
old. machine with a new seven-horsepower,
which he rides at least twice a week into
Launceston, about 20 miles distant. He
should go close to being Australia’s motor-
cycling Methuselah.
“Sucre”: Bloggs had married the divorced
wife of Coggs, but the lady’s two draws in
the matrimonial lottery had never met each
other until Pate and a lodge meeting threw
them together one recent night. “Mr. Coggs
—Mr. Bloggs,” said Goggs, introducing the
strangers. Bloges was a little flurried, but
Coggs rose to the occasion. “Delighted to
meet my er—husband-in-law,” he assured
his predecessor, nonchalantly extending his
hand.
“Sierra”: Re “Oxmead’s” query on
buried .metaphors (B. 2/8/’23). In
Lancashire, 40 years ago, “playing the
wag,” “wagging it” and “playing sag”
were common expressions. Professor
Weekley gives the word “wag” in “to
play the wag” as short for “waghalter,” a
rogue. The same authority says: “To pull
one s leg originally Scotch ‘To draw one’s
!eg—suggests tripping.” But what about
the North of England phrases “pulling his
lug” (ear), i.e., leading him on, and “biting
his lug —-getting something from him?
Might not “pulling his leg” have been derived
from the former by the similarity of sound?
Stellsby”: In Australia is it permissible
to sell war decorations? General Cowans,
who was Quartermaster-General of the Brit-
ish Army during the war, left his widow
unprovided for. True, the lady draws her
general is-widow pension of £225 per annum,
d*i c J me d a further £lOO a year from the
Cml List. When skies were greyest, to the
lady s dismay the trustee for the late Gen-
eral s Shylockian creditors decided to sell all
his orders and decorations, and they were
duly displayed for sale in the window of a
Xiccadilly firm. However, an anonymous
Samaritan bought up the gewgaws and pre-
sented them to the grateful widow, to be held
by her during her lifetime, stipulating that
afterwards they should go to either South
Kensington Museum or the United Services
Institution.
Alpha : A well-known Melbourne lawyer
who. used to pride himself on never
a client sustained a severe shock the other
day. In 1916 he undertook some involved and
protracted work for a highly-respected citi-
zen, who subsequently left for “abroad,” where
he had business interests. A couple of years
later he turned up with more work for the
solicitor, who casually reminded him he
hadn’t settled the former bill, amounting to
about £2OO, and was put off with a "jocular
rejoinder. This year the rolling-stone
again visited his lawyer with instruc-
tions to do some more work, and
was asked, a trifle pointedly this time
to fix .up the old account. The lay-

Let Your Chickens Squeak, but
Not Your Farm Machinery
If friction could speak it would say —“I am robbing you
of power, of production and profit.” If your machinery
and implements were human they would tell you that
friction was pain, and pain is the forerunner of trouble.
Beware of friction! It is the sneak thief that
makes things wear out before they should. The
timely drop of the correct oil saves money.
Our new 60-page Booklet—
“ Petroleum On The Land ”
which is free upon request, deals with the lubri-
cation and care of engines, agricultural machinery
and implements from Ploughs to heavy Tractors.
“Petroleum on the Land” contains a fund of
interesting and valuable information on Petroleum
and its relation to every phase of farm life.
It is written by experts and should be in your
hands for constant reference. Ask your local
Storekeeper for a copy or write to our nearest

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
rBA|HEY found her with her lover in a
wood.
J- The great brown trunks were dry
from weeks of drought,
The bracken, crisp about the seekers’ feet,
Crackled to warn the quarry; but she stood
Fearless and smiling, in her rind-red gown.
Parted above her wide, white brow, her hair
Hung in twin heavy plaits on either side
And down her back there streamed a fleecy
veil,
As water hangs above the boiling pool
In summer falls —that pool her passionate
love,
Pulsing the hollow in her slender throat.
Upon her slim, soft hand no ring was set,
But, like a chain, about her lover’s life
Her heart was firmly knit.
The King leapt down,
Coldly appraised her through his jetty lash.
His jutting chin became more grim, his
grasp
Closed on his sword, as though it dipt a
maid;
And when they bound her lover at her feet,
Dazed from the bloody pike, the King cast
off
His gauntlet. As a gourmet’s knife unwinds
The ripe red paring from the ripe red fruit,
He tore from her proud shoulders that red
gown
And left her little breasts like apples peeled,
Round, ivory-white, and luscious to the lip.
Not once did her head droop, but always
straight
She looked grey steel in the despoiler’s eyes.
He bent her head back till the riband broke
And the fine veil fell on the dappled sward,
Loosing the scented twilights of her hair.
He kissed the sweet repellence of her mouth;
And she left blood on his with even teeth,
Sharp, hard as flint. With muscle kings
may take
But they can never hold. Men caught her
hands
And trussed them with strong fastenings
each to each ;
And made her walk beside the royal steed
Through briar and bush and over stony ways.
They left a dagger in her lover’s heart;
And slow she moved and never once looked
back.
The King built for his prize a carven tower,
Strange, scented of the East. He brought
on ships
Bales of rich merchandise, to hang the walls
With jewel-colors worked in silk and gem;
He sent for harpers and for serving-maids.
From Java came a parrot in a cage—
All blue and green and sudden blaze of red —
With tiny thumbnail, gorgeous, feathered
things.
She opened window wide and set them free;
And from her lattice to the crystal lake
She cast the sapphires that the King had
given,
With hollow emerald and white aigrettes stiff
With gold and silver brought from farthest
Ind.
Half-naked fishers found them in their nets
And swore there was enchantment on the
land,
Part fain and part afraid to bear them home;
Though some found way into the market-
place
And made red quarrel betwixt peaceful men.
Unused to being crossed in love or war,
The King grew pale and restless; baulked
desire
Gnawed at his body through the summer
days.
In mating time he heard the antlered stag
Cry in the forest to the trembling hind ;
He tossed upon his pillow and looked out
Into the moonlit green, and cursed the heart
That still remembered trysting in a wood
With that which fell to dust amid the fern.
Surely a king’s love were more meet for her.
She holds her little head like any queen ;
Surely she must forget the bloodied pike—
And what are dead men’s kisses to a girl?
The darkness cannot hold her in its arms.
Once dead, a man is dead. Must she then go
Virgin to grey old age because of one
Who is a shadow now in Shadowland?
And when he saw her white face like a star
Watch from her lattice how the deer came
forth
Stamping in moony glades, and down
In the warm spicy brakes a mottled snout
Rose through the pavisade, and in the bough
Some sleepy nestling cooed a sympathy,
Wrapped in his silken robe the King crept
forth
With the great ruby swinging at his throat,
Stole to her door and whispered; and he
heard
Only her strange, low laughter—“ Aye! Come
in!
The ice that is my heart will cool thy lust!”
Beaten, the King crawled back; and to the
dawn
Sobbed in his pillows. Last year’s mistresses
Tried odorous allure with banded hair
And garments weighed in gems. He saw
them not—
Sick was his soul with hungering for a star.
And then the King died of a pale disease
The leech called witchcraft, out of baffled
love,
Impotent angers, or what irks kings most.
She saw the mourners winding to the lake,
Like a black serpent on a piebald field
Where buttercups and daisies danced in dew
After the gentle rains that blessed the land.
There the black barge swung in a weedy tide
That ran like watered ribbon through the
grass
And green-sheathed iris. Still, like some fail-
star,
Her face lit up her lattice. It was Spring;
And all the blue world smelled of briar rose.
The rabble shouted at the palace gate;
And women cried to “burn the silver witch
Vv no slew the King.” And when they surged
and broke
Into the tower built of sandal-wood
They found her seated in an ebon chair,
A star on the dark citadel of night,
Dead, with her dead heart covered by the
gown
Of red and gold that was like apple skin
O’er fruit no favor from a king could buy!
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE sun dipped behind the mist-
wreathed peaks. A veil of snow-
white fog crept up from the lowlands
and gradually outlined the sinuous course
of the river among the dark-green cliffs of
the jungle. A flock of hornbills flew over-
head. Night drew near.
Hawkins, seated on the split-palm veran-
dah of his brown-thatched house, pulled his
coat around him to shut out the evening
chill from his malaria-sapped frame. He
shivered as the cool air from the stark
heights rustled the thatch above him.
“Not a sign of the mail,” he remarked,
like most lonely men, thinking aloud. “Ten
days overdue to-night! I’ll have another
look before the dark blots out the track.”
He lifted the binoculars, his wasted hands
shaking from weakness, and focussed the
lenses on the croton-edged path that led up
the ridge from the jungle’s fringe, 700 yards
away. The track was empty. He turned
the glasses on the gap among the trees
where the path led into the gloom—and a
figure came into view. The long-expected
mail! In his delight he almost dropped
the glasses.
“Mopi! Mopi!” he called to the mop-
haired savage who acted as his food-ruiner
and house-boy.
The boy poked his black face around the
corner.
“Light the lamp—-quick !”
Hawkins stepped about excitedly. A mail
was in sight. Letters! If he was very
lucky there might even be late papers—
only a month old! Real news from the
outside world —his first for nearly two
months.
He passed a hand across his temples.
“Whew! I feel rotten; nearly due for an-
other bout of fever. I’ll skim through the
letters first.” He shook a tablet of aspirin
from a bottle and swallowed it. “Must have
a clear head to enjoy the news.”
He hummed the chorus of a song, a hit
in Sydney four years ago.
The green mass of the scrub faded into
a blue haze; a star flamed like a diamond
in a rent in the leaden clouds overhead.
The sick man looked across the valley.
“Only a few more days of silence—living
death, that’s what existence up here is. New
Guinea, you’re a blood-sucker —but a fas-
cinating land ! Lord, what doesn’t a fellow
put up with in these solitary places while
he’s acting Big Brother to the Backward
People! Reek and filth of the jungle—for
what? Not for the little lucre there is in
the job ; probably it’s for something else....
Hell! Why can't that boy shift himself —
the lazy toad !. .. . A-ah ! Here he comes.
... .Where the blazes did I put that knife?”
Mopi came through the doorway. “Tau-
bada, what kind kaikai me cook along
dinner?” he asked.
Hawkins, busy with the bag, waved him
away. “Cook anything. You been fix up
lamp proper fashion?” he asked, and shook
out the precious epistles in a little heap
before him.
The boy nodded and departed, to clatter
pots and tinware in the kitchen.
A lonely paper lay among the blue enve-
lopes. Disappointment number one. A look
at the waybill—the carrier had left the
coast only a day before the arrival of the
mailboat from Australia!
He rapidly scanned the letters. Two he
read a second time and placed in a basket
marked “Please Explains.” “Wonder those
high-salaried heads don’t cultivate a bit of
grey matter under their hats—and (save
their typewriters much wear and tear! I
did a good bit of work to bag those killers
at Modaru —got ’em after wading 40 miles
in the slush and filth of a sago-swamp—
but they’re not satisfied. Want to know
what their divorce and marriage customs
are! How can I tell what they'are—until
I take another toddle out there to catch
some crinkly-skinned old Modaru citizen who
might loosen his jaws a little and enlighten
my colossal ignorance on the subject! Hell!
What a life !”
He opened another envelope, and fairly de-
voured the lines of type. This was the
letter, the momentous epistle that he had
waited so many weary weeks to receive. It
would tell him how his application for leave
had fared.
The extremely courteous official phrases
burnt themselves into his throbbing brain:
“I am directed to inform you. . . .application
for six months’ vacation.... granted.... re-
gret short delay.... exigencies of the service
prevent.... relief by Mr. Jones.... his re-
turn from furlough... .next month”....
Sick with malaria and loneliness, he
groaned. “One more month in this Hell-
hole ! Lord ! It’s enough to send a fellow
barmy!” He threw the letter on the table
and tramped up and down the creaking floor
like a caged tiger.
Solitude had set its mark on Hawkins; he
was on the verge of a nervous breakdown —
a peevish box of nerves. Bad food, over-
work, much malaria and loneliness had
sapped his resistance almost to the breaking-
point. A wave of childish self-pity enveloped
him. His eyes filled with unshed tears. Dis-
appointment borne alone is doubly bitter. He
plumbed the very depths of misery; malaria
is very depressing.
The paper offered some little mental salve.
He opened it out. “Suffering—tomcats!” he
screamed. “An advertisement for somebody’s
nerve tonic!” He burled the miserable pam-
phlet from him and threw himself into a
chair. Head in hands, he sat hunched up,
aflame with the first spasms of malaria.
The cook-boy brought a tray of crockery
and commenced to lay the table. A book
crashed into the cluster of cups and plates;
the boy fled along the verandah shedding
broken crockery as he went.
“A bat!” Hawkins leaped from his chair,
snatched a spear from the wall and chased
the obscene thing from room to room. “Like
the wraith of a lost soul!” He laughed
harshly. The spear swept a row of bottles
from a shelf; the frightened house-boy peeped
around the door —and fled toward the bar-
racks.
“What was that?” A tiny black form
fluttered by his head. “Another filthy bat!”

Is that dull, nagging backache making it hard for you
to get around? Are you lame, sore and tortured with
sharp rheumatic pains at every step? It’s time, then, you
gave some attention to your kidneys! Nature, you know,
has a way of warning you when all is not right with the
bodily machinery. A dull, persistent backache is one
of her first signals of kidney weakness. You may have
, . i daily headaches, too, with dizziness and annoying
bladder irregularities. You are depressed and nervous —worn out and miserable. You feel years older
than you are. Why let this condition continue? Kidney troubles, if treated early, are usually easily
corrected. Neglected, the way .is paved for fatal kidney disease. Don t take this risk! Begin now
with Doan s Backache Kidney Pills. Doan s have helped thousands and should help you. Ask your
neighbor. . '
SYDNEY MAN CURED.
Mr. H. Holder, 235 West Street, North, Sydney, says:—“Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills
are indeed a wonderful kidney medicine. I have proved this. For a long time I suffered
agony from backache and kidney trouble, and only those who have been afflicted in this way
have any idea what I went through. My limbs swelled considerably, the kidney secretions
- were—thick and cloudy, with a red sediment, and I had agonising pains in my back. When I
stooped it was as much as. I could do to stand up straight again without assistance; my-
back was so stiff and lame. I was treated by a doctor, and tried all sorts of remedies, but
nothing gave me the slightest relief. I was naturally very worried about the serious state of
my health, and when Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were brought under my notice I decided
to try them. It was a grand thing for me that I got this remedy, for seven bottles cured me
completely. I cannot speak too highly of Doan’s Pills, and recommend them with every
confidence to other sufferers.”
Six years later Mr. Holder says:—“l have still the same good opinion of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills. They cured me of kidney disorder six years ago, and I have had no return
of the complaint since.”

He lashed at the elusive shape; the creature
swept through the door and vanished. Some-
where out in the inky night a flying-fox
flapped heavily among the fruit-laden
branches of a mango.
The half-crazed man cursed and grabbed
his shotgun, slipped a couple of cartridges
into the breech, and tottered down the steps.
“Bang!” A streak of ruby fire split the
gloom; a chorus of squeaks and the beating
of many featherless wings answered the shot.
A flock of flying-foxes blundered past into
the broad leaves of the bananas above the
creek.
“Dirty, thieving beasts! I’ll teach ’em
to come and scoff the handful of fruit I’ve
managed to grow in this arid clay.” He
stumbled over a pineapple plant and tore the
side out of a trouser-leg. A sharp turn, and
he felt the earth crumble beneath his feet;
the gun roared as his hands gripped the
trigger.
* * * *
A faint light filtered through the mosquito-
net. Hawkins stopped counting mats of
rice from the steamer’s hold and opened his
eyes. A line of anxious black faces sur-
rounded his bed ; in the corner Mopi blub-
bered and held a glass of beaten-up egg and
brandy ready for his master’s return from
“the place of shadows.” The scared lad
thoroughly believed that his master had died ;
though the more intelligent of the interested
gathering were equally certain that he was
“not properly dead.”
Smiles lit the circle of inky faces; Mopi
leaped to the side of the bed. “Taubada,
you no dead ?” he inquired, his eyes filmed
.with tears.
Hawkins lifted his head. “Dead! Of
course I’m not dead! What damn idiot said
I was?” He laughed weakly. “What are all
you people doing here?” he snapped.
. The grizzled old sergeant coughed deferen-
tially. “We fellow come look out along you,
sir,” he explained. “Last Tiusidei night you
been fall down along creek, sir, an’ ”
Hawkins interrupted him. “Fell in the
creek?” He shivered. “What’s to-day?”
“Dis Pa-pa-paraidei, sir,” stuttered the
non-com.
“’Struth !” Realisation silenced him.
Mopi held the cup to his lips and he drank
the warm mixture ; his brain cleared and he
felt better.
“Well, the whole lot of you can clear out
to your houses; Mopi, go and get my bath
ready. Hurry along with it, and then go
and cook me some bacon and eggs; I’m
hungry.” He turned to the sergeant, who
had stood aside while his mates filed out of
the door. “What are you hanging on for?”
The non-com. stiffened to attention.
”1 lease, sir, corporal belong Misi lonisi him
come dis inornin’ an’ him talk Misi lonisi
stop along landin’ get him swag an’ all him
somet’in’ along shore; close up lVlisi lonisi
him come along station for take ’m place
belong you, sir, time you go walk about along
you village ’long Seeknee [Sydney].” The
old fighter’s grim mouth smiled; for he was
proud to have made such a long speech in
"proper Angalisi.”
Hawkins leaped from his blankets; he
could hardly form the words that rushed to
his lips. “Mr. Jones at the landing! Why,
it s nearly sundown ; he’ll be here any minute
n J°w.” He slipped his shoes on and reached
the edge of the verandah. “Cripes,” he whis-
pered, “I must have gone off me rocker. It
is about, time I went south for a spell.”
A white topee flashed among the painted
leaves of the crotons beside the steps.
‘That you, Plawkins?” Jones hailed cheer-
ily- “I’ve broken all records —only back
from Australia seven days and into the
collar again! Had a devil of a rush.” He
gripped the thin hand of the man he had
come to relieve. “Jove! You’re looking
crook. The launch’ll hook it with you just
as soon as you can get packed up; and then
it 11 be you for the bright lights and real
rood of civilisation. You lucky cow!” He
looked about the house. “Pretty cosy little
spot. I’ll manage to hang on for a year or
so.
Hawkins gulped the lump in his throat.
Yes, not a bad little station; bit lonely at
times, you know, but there’s lots of worse
places. Hope they let me come back here
later,” he replied—and meant what he said.
A bat swished past.
Jones laughed. “Filthy brutes —bats!”
I let ’em alone because they’re sudden
death on mosquitoes,” chuckled Hawkins.
L. P. B. ARMIT.
The Parcel.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ril HE Poor Man’s Palace is a dreary place
I in which people pay cheaply for rest,
and get the cheapness but not the rest.
Most of it is in cubicles; and a cubicle in a
large building enables the would-be sleeper
to hear everybody else snore.
Down the stairs of the hostel crept the
woman, with a furtive look in her eyes and
a brown-paper parcel on her arms. As the
gaze of the Salvationist standing in the hall
went to her face with a challenge which
seemed to say “Are you saved?” her eyes
turned from his, guiltily. Obviously, she
wasn’t saved. She passed her keys over,
ignored the clerk’s statement that as they had
not been given in before 9.30 she should pay
another day’s rent, and moved in a shame-
faced fashion. from the room.
She was appallingly young for the misery
that appeared on her face, and terribly white
—her whiteness had almost a greenish tinge.
She looked frail and delicate, as if a flick
of wind might blow her over. A doctor
would have undoubtedly ordered her to bed;
but the man at the door in the Salvationist
cap was not a doctor.
“What’s that in the parcel?” he demanded.
“It’s mine!” she flashed, defiantly clutch-
ing the parcel tighter ; and, looking' abashed,
he stood back as she passed.
She wandered aimlessly along the street—
aimlessly and weakly, for she tottered now
and then as if she would fall. Plainly
she was ill; and within her was a terrible
craving—a craving for something to satisfy
her hunger or lull her senses. She pulled
out a purse and counted money—threepence
in silver, two pennies and three ha’pennies.
She had paused before a teashop where the
lowest price was eightpence, and she passed
on.
People were rushing into shops and out
again. Happy wives were leaving their hus-
bands on the pavement—they usually waited
two minutes and then “broke” for the nearest
hotel —messenger-boys were passing, whist-
ling. The scene was one of busy prosperity.
And through it passed the woman with her
parcel, weary, faltering, obviously sick. She
stopped before a wineshop. The warm, in-
viting smell of the wine came out to her.
Again she counted the money in her purse;
and then she entered.
“Port wine? Threepence or sixpence?”
She looked up dully from her seat. Dazedly
she realised where she was.
“A threepenny,” she said. That meant
two drinks at least.
A man lurched across to her as she sipped
it and sat down at the opposite side of the
table. She picked up the parcel she had
placed beside her and held it tightly. But
the man regarded her in a manner which was
meant to convey encouragement.
“Drink that up and have one with me,”
he said. “A real good ’un.”
She felt mellowed by the glow of the w'ine
—raw and meagre as it was —and, looking
up at the man, she smiled. Then the smile
died, and she shrank back.
He was gloating over her. His low-
browed, animal face had a leer which he
intended to be pleasant. In it she saw only
the bestiality which was at the back of
his mind. The heavy, rolled flesh of his
neck fascinated her. She knew that it was
no kindly impulse that had induced him
to come to her. He was a mere gorilla-
man seeking his desires.
Yet when the bar-keeper came round
she ordered port. The warmth of the liquor
was giving her neAV life, and she wanted more.
“Put your parcel down and enjoy your
wine,” said the man.
But she clasped the parcel more closely to
her, almost passionately. He looked at her
astonished ; and then he gloated again.
Her frail, shadowy beauty appealed to his
senses—appealed to that animal impulse in
him to hurt and destroy. Here was some-
thing fragile and delicate, apparently defence-
less before him. He called for the glasses to
be refilled.
During the second drink he put his huge,
rough hand upon hers. The wine was mel-
lowing her, transforming her weakness into
ecstatic foolishness, and she liked it. She
liked the feeling of strength and virility in
that hand —-she who felt so weak. She
wanted to cry—cry in some place where she
would feel safe in the contact with strength,
the strength of which that hand assured
her. Over her cold hunger the wine was
throwing a rosy warmth. The world that
had been so cruelly definite and unhopeful
an hour before was swimming mistily
around her, glad and welcoming.
“Put down your parcel,” said the man.
She suddenly recalled herself from her day-
dreaming and pulled it away as his ■ hand
touched it.
“Oh, if you feel that way!” said the man.
“Something pretty valuable you have there,
I should think. Have another port?”
She had it. Warmth was moving
in her veins, and she laughed sillily,
hilariously, at some coarse jest he
made. Encouraged, he moved from the
chair opposite to the one beside her
and his hand was laid familiarly upon
her knee. She showed no resentment, but
giggled; and the parcel quivered ominously
in her arms. The string had become dis-
arranged and she tried to fix it; then left it
as it was while he pressed her to have an-
other drink.
His face was inflamed; his greedy eyes
bulged. Even his ugly, blunt fingers seemed
to indicate the lust that his face indexed. A
loose end of the brown paper which wrapped
her parcel swayed open and hurriedly she
replaced it.
His arm was placed caressingly over her
shoulder. He whispered things in her ear
which she but half understood. She only knew
that wine was warxn, within her after she
had been cold, and that strength to lean
against was good. The repugnance, she at
first felt for him was gone. He had been
kind to her! Her heart said it in a demand
for the repayment of the kindness,
“Put down that parcel!” said the man,
with a drunken impatience.
He leaned over to grasp it with his dis-
engaged hand, and it slithered through her
arms to drop dully on the floor.
“My God !” she cried; and as she rose her
chair crashed as it fell backward to the floor.
“My Gawd !” echoed her companion.
His eyes bulged more as the wraps of
paper unfolded, revealing a waxen face,
deathly pale, and, as he judged it, only new-
born. He leaned over the table, staring,
all the lust now gone from his face.
“My Gawd!” he ejaculated again.
People gathered round them, open mouthed
—a nightmare of staring faces and gasping
breath.
The gorilla-man was shaking like a leaf.
Fear was upon him—the awful fear that
strikes the strong-bodied and weak-minded
to whom life, brutal life, is everything and
death is a terror. He felt entrapped in an
awful death-tragedy which shook him to the
minutest cell of his body. All he wanted
was to be out of it.
“Here!” he said. He tore a roll
from his pocket, and in a hurried, terrified
fashion slipped a five-pound note into the
hand of the woman. She was standing,
stupidly, in a daze, regarding the parcel and
its contents. Then he was gone.
The woman stooped to pick up the parcel.
Then she looked at the money in her hand,
dully, but with a glowing enlightenment.
“Well, this pays for it,” she said. “A
woman gave it to me to mend; but, staying
at the Poor Man’s Palace, I couldn’t do it.
And I wanted the money, too. Now it’s
broke, but it don’t matteix I’ve got enough
to live on till I get a job.”
The wine-shop proprietor had a peep at
the parcel, and breathed a sigh of relief. A
doll!
“Good Lord! I thought it was a dead
baby!” he said. “Come on. I’ll give you
another drink; and then go out and get a
feed.”
