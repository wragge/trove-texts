LLITERARY NOTES.
Bookseller Melville, of Melbourne, in a paper
read before the Library Conference, expressed the
opinion that from the disappearance of “ the
native periodical of high and literary kind,” or
from the fact that Australian authors “publish
their books through English houses,” “ we are
gainers.” Because, he says, our books are thus
“part of the broad stream of English literature.”
To measure the folly of this statement, apply it
to America. Or what would Melville say to book-
buyers who had their books sent out direct from
London on the ground that they thus formed part
of the broad stream of English book-selling?
* * * *
From a recent Adelaide Advertiser :
.—On the 27th March, at , the dearly-
beloved husband of Elizabeth ——, of inflammation of
the bowels, aged 30 years and 9 months, leaving a wife
and four children to mourn their loss.
What is home without our Johnny?
None in this world can tell
Like his broken-hearted loved ones,
For they miss him everywhere.
Oh, bear me gently to the grave,
And keep the funeral slow ;
The angels sing where I am gone,
And you should sing below.
Humor is chiefly the perception of the incongruity
of ideas. lor various reasons the average woman
has fewer ideas—thought-conoepts— than the
averageman; therefore she has so many fewer
points d'appui on which the Spirit of Incongruity
may rest. Is her sense of humor to be improved
by packing her fuller of ideas? Do educated
women see a joke better than uneducated ? Or
(2) is it to be improved by strengthening her
mental force apart from enlarging her mental
area ? It is not enough to have the incongruous
ideas at hand : there needs some electricity to
combine them, some dynamic power to overcome
their inertia. Do women of good natural brain-
grasp see a joke quicker than the intellectually
deficient ?

Kingsley’s energy is pulsating still. A N.S. W.
Member of Parliament—Mr. Copeland—moved
the other day to establish State clothing factories.
I got this idea from reading ‘Alton Locke,’ ”
he said. “Who wrote it?” queried somebody.
Mr. Copeland “thought it was Reade.” But if
people are going to forget the author, and remem-
ber only his work, of what use is it to
sell his sinews to be wise,
His teeth and bones to buy a name?
Of course, you cannot argue from a Member
of Parliament.
* * * *
. La Gallienne : “Length in literature is only
justified by depth. There is no excuse for it in
fiction but subtlety of character-drawing, or such
constant rip-rap of incident as we find in Reade’s
Cloister and the Hearth.” Guy do Maupassant
and Rudyard Kipling have lived in vain if the
tired reviewer may not take ad vantage of their
new formulae for the expression of human drama.”

OUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
ehronio. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven yeatß, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acknowledg.
merit from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well. —Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Ilearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S. W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
59 other leading residents.

Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish

study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.

bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-

dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing

of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-

GELIEBT UND VERLOREN.
Oeliebt und verloren : she stood foam-white
In the fragrant dusk of the Southern night,
Framed by the clinging passion-vine ;
And I see alway the dark eyes shine,
The dim verandah, the throbbing light
Of the stars that reeled in our reeling sight;
And across the long years’ leaden flight
A memory and a word are mine—
Oeliebt und verloren !
One year of blameless, pure delight,
Then the bolt from the blue (Heaven’s curse on its
might !);
A grave by the friendly sea is thine,
Its song thy dirge, and the breeze in the pine:
For me long thoughts that sting and bite —
Oeliebt und verloren.

“BY THE SOUND OF THE SEA.”
She was born, she was bred,
She was wooed, she was won, she was wed —
By the sound of the sea.
By the roar of its waves—
By its cliffs, and its caves,
She was loved, and was wed.
She is dead—she lies dead—
By the sound of the sea.
• • • • • •
“ Oh, where —oh, my Love !
Hast thou sped, hast thou fled ?
From the sound of the sea—
From the wash of its waves,
From its echoing caves—
Where, oh where, didst thou flee ?
“With seaweed for cypress,
I picture thy grave—
Silver sand for its turf,
Beaten down by the wave—
By the surge of the sea.
“Not long shall I linger,
Not long shalt thou wait;
She beckons, dear finger—
Dear finger of Fate.
Far away from the din,
From the crowd and the crush —
Where the tide cometh in
With a roar and a rush—
Oh, there make our grave,
Silver sand for our turf —
’Neath the crest of the wave,
By the sob of the surf. ”
Maoriland.

AND HE DID EAT.
1 “ The woman tempted me and I did eat.”— Genesis,
act Hi., scene 2.
And he did eat:
Let’s thank the Fates ’tis so,
For all the joys transcending that we know,
And haste to greet.
“ The woman tempted him ” —the words are writ,
And thus he fell away ;
So, with the beams of beauty, wiles of wit,
Her daughters tempt to-day.
And we do eat.
And he did eat :
A jealous God defied, ,
Who guessed that woman would His power divide,
If not defeat;
And, heeding not the threatened cost,
Eve to his bosom strained ;
What was the Paradise he lost
Beside the one he gained ?
So he did eat.
And he did eat:
So let us kiss and die,
And thank old Adam that to-day we lie
’Midst raptures sweet.
What would we give for such another curse ?
Who values aught above ?
What profits it to gain the universe
And taste not woman’s love ?
And so we eat.

IN A GULLY.
Rivulet! running with melodious fall
Under the shadow of down-drooping ferns,
Where aromatic breezes musical
Follow in playfulness thy mazy turns;
What if the fern should bid thy wave to stay,
To make delightful her half-hidden home?
Thou wouldst not tarry there, but glide away,
Forgetful of her fronds, afar to roam.
What if she droopeth fondly hour by hour,
Hoping to touch thee once ere thou canst go,
Shedding her garner from the Summer shower
In drops submissive to thine underflow ?
Thou dost not think of her, thou art not moved
By her mute invocation to thee bowed ;
So I, like her, have all too fondly loved
One too like thee, tameless and cold and proud,
And I would be upon thy bosom borne,
With my oppressive load of wretchedness
Slid from my heart, and with thee float forlorn
Into the ocean of forgetfulness.

CONVALESCENT.
Let me lie in the sunshine and out of the wind
Here on the grass where the puppies play,
And the scent of the air from the barn behind
Is full of the fragrance of new-mown hay ;
While over my head the parroquets wheel,
Pleasant it is when thus reclined
To let youth’s sweet hours onward steal—
Warm in the sunshine and out of the wind.
Says a voice at my ear —as, slim and white,
A hand points out to the distant blue
“ There are prizes for those who share in the fight:
A prize perhaps may be won by you.”
But I : “ Ah, no ! let them fight who will :
Peace and warmth are more to my mind :
For you and me, let us linger still—
Warm in the sunshine and out of the wind.
“ Soon enough, dear, must everyone,
As fallen leaves and dead flowers teach,
Find the place where neither sun
Nor murmur of any wind can reach.
By us, as long as your lips are red,
And round my neck your arm is twined,
Let no other wisdom than this be said—
‘ Warm in the sunshine and out of the wind.

The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIX>ON & SON S, by the aid of newly-in vented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Price Hitliei’tO Ull‘
known Here a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (T uelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equal ly-choice Seed Leaf, and together they form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sized Cigars for 6d.! J —will at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and t'OXs? intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate and prove what can be done.
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigai, ha\ e lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
_No_e- Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any

SATURDAY, MAY 30, 1896.
The N.S.W. Political Outlook.
The N.S.W. Parliament resumed liusiness
lately with prospects of . a most interesting
session. The programme put forward by the
Reid Government is enormously long and
unwieldy, but there is much to be said for
it from a Democratic standpoint. Most of
the proposed measures are useful and pro-
gressive—or the}' should be so, unless the
ineptitude of the GoD-fearing Ministry, or
the opposition of the Ly>~e party, or the old
Calico-Jimmy party, or the Upper House, or
the morning shoddy organs, destroys their
usefulness in detail. Among the things pro-
mised are the restriction of colored immi-
gration. the locking of the Darling River so
as to provide a permanently-navigable water-
way and a permanent supply of water for
irrigation in the W est, and Acts to prevent
the adulteration of food and drink, to regu-
late factories and workshops, to abolish The
■■ truck system, to amalgamate the savings
banks into a State Bank of issue, to
build light railways, and to authorise the
acquisition of land for subdivision into
agricultural allotments—all of which are more
or less commendable if worked out on a
state.sm inlike basis. Also, it is proposed to
reform the L pper House, which is highly
desirable provided the reform is of a kind
tiiat will place that autocratic Chamber under
the control f>f the people ; and to establish a
modified Referendum applicable to “ im-
portant bills on which the two Houses have
disagreed in two consecutive sessions, " which,
at least, amounts to something, And, in
addition to these, a dozen or two other prac-
tical reforms are promised, including a bill
for the abolition of medical quacks," and a
measure for providing cheaper and more
easily accessible justice—which last is about
the most urgent and the least probable of
them all. The luckless Local Government
Bill is missing altogether ; but even without
it, if the Reid Ministry can carry out its
programme, and the programmes prove any-
thing like as good as it looks, X.S. Wales
should profit considerably in many ways.
The fact that the intentions of the Govern-
ment are good, and that those of the Assembly
seem to be moderately good, and that those
of the Council are apparently not nine
worse than usual, is something to begin with.
It remains to be seen, however, whether
there is sufficient intellect in the Govern-
ment and its following to carry out its plans
successfully. With the possible exception of
the Premier, the GoD-fearing Ministry is an
association of mediocrities of the most
mediocre description. The Foreign-trade
party in general is also dismally mediocre,
and it is to some extent divided against
itself, and it is also divided against its press
organs. The recent vanishment of W ise,
Dibbs, Parkes, Bartox, Slattery, Bruce
Smith, and others removed a lot of con-
spicuous ability— most of it ability of a kind
that did very little good to the country, yet
ability of a sort all the same. The present
is the Wilks and Whiddox and Parson
Smailes era—the period of much respectable
commonplace and much orthodox bun-
struggle. The M‘Millax section of the
Foreign-trade party is at one with the
Government about nothing except its
desire for Foreign-trade, and even its
brand of Foreign-trade is not the kind
which the Government advocates. The
freedom of trade which M Millax wants
is the free admission of softgoods, and
enough duties on other articles to preclude
any necessity for direct taxation, which falls
heavily on the importer’s profits. The
Government, too, is more or less divided
against itself ; the Reid end of it upholds
payment of members and threatens to demo-
cratise the L pper House therewith, and the
W axt end of it regards the same payment
as an invention of the devil and desires to
abolish i f utterly.
• » * »
The Labor-party of to-day is apparently
below the mental calibre of the original one
of a few years ago, and its leader is probably
one of the six dullest men in the Assembly.
A part of the Labor-party and a section of
the Freetraders are pledged to demand an
increase of the present land-tax, while the
Premier and at least one other member of
the Ministry are pledged to hold office in no
Cabinet which proposes to increase that tax
beyond its present figure. Meanwhile, it is
becoming more and more obvious that when
Freetrade really arrives—at present only an
instalment of it has come to hand—more
revenue must be obtained to fill the gap thus
created, and seeing that the Govt, is pledged
not to obtain it either by land sales or in-
creased land-tax only three courses seem to
be open. One is to pass a Local Govern-
ment Bill, and shift a lot of the expenditure
on to the local bodies, and keep the promise
in the letter while breaking it in the spirit
by making the increased land-tax a local
instead of a national affair. Another is to
fake ’ the public accounts by charging
ordinaiy expenditure to loans—the same
process by which Premier Reid squared his
first balance - sheet when he put nearly
£400,000 of borrowed money into revenue
on account of certain alleged transactions
dating many years back, and the process by
which he also squared his second balance-
sheet, when repairs to roads, bridges, and
old dredges were charged promiscuously to
loan-expenditure. The third possible* re-
source is to borrow money freely for “ light
railways," water conservation, and other
works, and thereby make an artificial burst
of prosperity which will inflate the existing
sources of revenue while it lasts, and leave
things more depressed than ever when it is
over.
* » * *
The Opposition, at all events, promises to
do neither much good nor much harm during
the present session. Almost all its bright
men were thrown out at the last elections,
while most of its preternaturally dull men
were returned by good majorities. The
hopeless and antiquated Copelaxd is fast
disrupting what remains of the partv by
endeavouring to jump the position of leader,
now held by the equally antiquated and hope-
less Lyxe. The latter politician, by the
sheer habit of opposing all the proposals of
the Government, has committed himself and
his Parliamentary followers to a policy of
old crusted Toryism, and thereby discredited
them with the country at large, and the man
who wants to succeed him has so far coun-
tenanced his action. Still, The Bulletix
trusts that Copelaxd will continue to struggle
for the leadership to the utmost of his ability,
and disrupt the Protectionist-party in the
Assembly all he knows. It is practically cer-
tain that he will never become leader, but in
the general upheaval and free-light which will
ensue it is just possible that the new man who
has so long been wanted may come to the
front. Who that new man may be it is at
present almost impossible to guess. Amon®
all the three parties there is not just now
visible one individual who looks like a com-
manding statesman. Even such a man as
Premier Turxer. of Victoria, whose level-
headedness. intense industry and great capa-
city for detail make a gpod substitute for
genius, can't be found at present in the
.X.S.W. Legislature. The Government is
loose and eloquent and sloppy and well-
meaning, and its measures are wonderful
examples of well-intentioned incomprehensi-
bility. And the balance of the House Ls
mostly beneath contempt, or somewhere
thereabouts.
•.* * *
The Legislative Council is in the main as
bitterly opposed to reform as ever. The ten
new members whom Premier Reid sent up
there last year are too few and weak to seri-
ously improve the tone of the Tory Cham-
ber, and even they have supported the
Government none too well. The Council is
not Protectionist, nor is enthusiastic about
genuine Freetrade ; it rather wants the old
revenue-tariff system of the M 'Millay days,
and no direct taxation, and peace and gentle
stagnation. The Government s representa-
tive in the Council. Attorney-General Wavt,
is utterly at variance with the new Demo-
cratic programme of his alleged party. The
alleged Government organ, the Daily Tele-
graph. supports the Ministry on its Foreign-
trade policy and curses every* separate Demo-
cratic item of its programme. It does not
definitely curse these items in the Reid pro-
gramme, but when many similar proposals
were advanced by Kingston in S.A. and by
•Seddon in Maori land and by Turner in
V ictoria, it denounced them unsparingly, so
its attitude is sufficiently e'xplicit. The S.M.
Herald, as the inferior Government organ,
mildly supports the Government’s Foreign-
trade policy and feebly “ deprecates ” every-
thing else. The Opposition organ denounces
everything the Government says or does or
is and acknowledges not one redeeming
feature in it. The Labor-parcy claims that
it is the power which owns and drives
dhe Reid Ministry, but the Labor-
party isn’t strong enough to form a
Ministry by itself, and it can’t sell
itself to Lyne now that Lyne has sold
himself to the L pper House and to old bar-
nacled Toryism, so it must support Reid in
the meantime, and therefore Reid owns it
body and soul—or very nearly so. Mean-
while, Reid, by posing as the democratic
leader of the Assembly, is cutting the ground
from under the feet of the Labor members.
They* could show a reason for their separate
existence when they were a democratic frag-
ment raising a voice of protest against the
stagnant order of things as represented by
Parkes on one hand and Dibbs on the other.
They can show much less reason now, when
they have principally to say “ ditto ” to
Reid ; yet in the order of things there is
nothing else which they can say. They might
begin a new separate existence as the party*
of financial reform—the jiarty which sets its
face hard against furilier borrowing, especi-
ally foreign borrowing, and demands that all
public works shall in future be built out of
revenue ; but there is at present no sign of
this. There is abundant room for such a
party in a Legislature where the finance of
all parties is about equally slipshod ; and by-
assuming the role, the Labor-men would do
a vast national service. Also, they would
thereby keep the country* from forgetting
their separate existence and their claims
upon the public gratitude. Too much ditto
to the party* which has borrowed their prin-
ciples will end sooner or later in the country-
forgetting whose principles they originally
were.
♦ » » «
The present is obviously a transition period
in X.S.M . politics. All periods are so more
or less, but the present is more definitely a
period of transition than most others. The
combination of Reid, M‘Millay, Want,
the old revenue-tariffists, the new Foreign-
traders and the Labor-party, can’t last.
Somebody must needs go out, and who it
will be, and where he will go, and what he
will do when he gets there, wherever it may
be, are interesting questions. The Reid
Government, the Radical Labor-party, and
the Conservative Daily* Telegraph' can’t
always keep on pretending to be one party
and one interest. The present Protec-
tionist party can’t last; the Protectionists
in the country, who are as democratic
as any other class, can’t be dragged for ever
at the tail of the Conservative section merelv
because Lyne has drifted into that unfor-
tunate situation and doesn’t know how to
get out of it. The alliance of Crick, the
more or less radical Protectionist, and Lyne
and Copeland, the Tory Protectionists,
doesn t look as if it could endure much longer,
and something must happen to the Upper
House if the Reid programme is to be carried
out, or to the Reid Government if it isn’t.
Further, the country can't live for ever on
borrowed money and on humping ashore
foreign-made goods at Circular Quav. Sydney,
so altogether the next great shuffle of the
political cards should be interesting.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Unmarried FPublicaness.
The licensing courts of Xew South Wales have
practically ukased that no public-house licenses
shall be granted to unmarried women. Only
one unmarried woman, it appears, now holds a
license in the province, and every aDplication by
a spinster is flatly declined. 'The Bclletix
respectfully asks the “ Binch ' to give reasons
for its conduct in thi3 matter, seeing that it
allows widows and married women to hold
licenses, and permits spinsters to officiate as
barmaids, and also permits the publican's un-
married daughter to be about the premises.
It can t act as it does on the ground that the
publican needs to be a muscular person capable
of doing his own chucking out. for a widow
can't chuck out any better than a spinster, and,
besides, many male publicans are so small’or so
old that any ordinary unmarried woman of 25
or so could throw them out bodily with one
hand. It can t lie because keeping a pub
might lead the unmained publicaness into
drinking habits, else the bench would raise its
voice again the widowed publicaness also who
is quite as likely to be led astray, and against
the male drink-seller’s wife and daughter and
barmaid, and all his female belongings. It is
impossible to assume that the refusal is based
on the assumption that the drink-seller has to
listen to mucli language that is quite unlit for
publication, because the unmarried Miss Pcblic-
HorsE would, in most cases, simply put a spin-
ster barmaid behind her bar to 'listen to the
language, just as the male Mr. PcßLiCHorst-
now does. An unmarried female has to listen
to most of the language in any case. Possibly
the bench thinks that a licensee should be \
person who can curse back at the obstreperous
customer, but in many hotels the licensee is
seldom about, and, in any case, a spinster can
curse back quite as well as a widow, and both ol
them can curse at second-hand per medium of the
boots or the handy man, and, moreover, the
Bench shouldn’t countenance cursing in any
case. And if. as seems possible, it refuses to
countenance the maiden grog-dealer for the
alleged reason that the business tends to im-
morality, then it has no right to license the
widow, and the man who keeps his daughters
on the premises, and the man who employs
barmaids and thus exposes them to temptation.
When the barmaid does “go wrong,” her
seducer is as often the boss publican as any-
body else, and the male licensee is a cause of
immorality rather than a protection against it.
The only result of the present policy is that the
unmarried woman has to sell herself into slavery
by getting her license through a dummy, or a
brewer’s nominee, and keeping him on the pre-
mises as a guarantee of good faith, or she has
to marry some more or less objectionable person
to qualify herself, or she has to become the
rack-rented sub-tenant of a private bar. There
doesn’t appear on the surface of things one
reason for the present policy which can stan<T
inspection, and if the licensing benches have a
reason they ought to be made to explain it
forthwith.
W A. Land-Grant Hailways.
If any Australian province is still unconvinced
of the foolishness of the land-grant railway
system the experience of Westralia should
bring conviction. Natural conditions made
Westralia a happy hunting-ground for the land-
grant railway promoter.' The extent of the
province made railways particularly necessary
for its development, and a few million acres
more or less seemed of no particular account.
The population, being small, hesitated to build
extensive lines when private companies would
undertake the work for so much mere laud. So
private enterprise was given practically a free
hand. In 1884 the late Anthony Hordern
contracted to build a line from Albany to
Beverley (on the Govt. Eastern Railway), a
distance of 242 miles, for a subsidy of 12,000
acres per mile selected east and west of’the
line within a belt of 40 miles on each side, the
total subsidy thus being nearly three million
acres of land. The province did not get its
line as soon as it had hoped, for the contractor
sold his concession to the W.A. Land Co.,
which transfer the Govt, had to pass an Act to
confirm, and the line was not opened for traffic
till 1889. five years after the first contract was
made. Nevertheless Westralia was grateful,
as w itness an obelisk at Albany recording the
grat it uae of the peopleof theprovince to Anthony
Hordern for promoting the scheme. The co.
had only one small difficulty with the Govt.—
when they set forth to take possession of all
the unsold lots in the towns along the lines,
which undoubtedly the terms of the concession
gave them power to do. Then the Government
played a trump-card by declaring all the said
lots Government reserves. In 1896 the W.A.
Land Co. possesses a handsomely-paying trunk
line and is one of the biggest landlords ld the
province. It has sold some land, has an agri-
cultural tenantry on some more, and can afford
to wait while the rest is increasing in value,
which, being some of the best agricultural land
in \\ .A., it is doing rapidly. Omitting some-
thing like a score of timber concession and other
lines, the province’s other principal experiment
in land-grant railways is the Midland line,
280 miles in length, connecting the Eastern
and Northern Government systems. The
Midland scheme was launched in 1890.
The line cost £1,062,000, and the com-
pany received 3,360,000 acres of land, the
best of which was selected, alternately with
the Government, in blocks of 12,000 acres, with
five miles frontage to the line. The co. got
into difficulties before the line was finished, and
the Government had to come to the rescue with
a guarantee of £60,000. Now Westralia is
thinking hard over the bargains made, and the
province, having given six million acres of the
best land in the country away to induce two
co’s to build over 500 miles of paying line,
would like it back again. A deputation, com-
prising principally settlers on the Southern line,
has already asked Government to buy back that
line and the balance of the co s grant of land.
The Govt, is sympathetic, but is wondering how
it can be done. Westralia"s credit is good at
present, but probably not to the extent of the
millions which would be required to buy the
Southern and Midland lines and the territory
so recklessly squandered in connection with
their construction.
Overstocked Squattages.
The position of pastoral lands in the Western
Division of N.S. Wales wants enquiring into
closely (writes a Bulletin correspondent in the
Far YV est). One after the other pastoral lessees
have come up and sworn that the carrying
capacity of their country has depreciated any-
thing from 20 to SO per eent. The average
depreciation is stated to be 45 per cent. Not-
withstanding that, the stock-returns show only
a small reduction in the uumber of sheep carried
w lieu they show any reduction at all. In many
cases where a 50 per cent, reduction in the
carrying-capacity had beeu sworn to before the
appraising Land Boards, the stock-returns have
shown that there were more sheep on the land
at the end of last year than there were six
years ago. The explanation given is that it
pays better to risk losing a verv large per-
centage of the flocks in bad 'seasons for
the sake of the extra wool that can be
got in good seasons by overstocking. The
argument runs something in this way : “I
ought to carry only 50,000 sheep, but I am
carrying 100,000. If I only carried 50,000 I
should lose perhaps 2500 in a fair year." Sheep
die just as men do—a fact that city statisticians
never seem to take into account.) “ With
100,000 I lose 5000 in a fair year: in a bad
year, perhaps one in three, I lose 25,000. But
what does that matter ? I have had for two
years the wool for 50.000 sheep more than I
ought to have carried and from 25,000 for the


third year. Why, even if I lost the other
25,000 the next year, I would still be to the
g >od, because I can’t average more for a sheep
than I can average for the wool off
a sheep’s back for a single year.” In these
circumstances the sympathy expended upon
the squatter is largely uncalled-for. Moreover,
the figures showing the steady increase in the
stock losses annually are not as significant as
they are sometimes represented—at least, they
are significant in another way. It might reason-
ably be objected, also, that it is hardly a decent
thing to overcrowd country with the full
knowledge that whenever a bad season comes
there will be tremendous mortality among the
flocks through starvation. If the thing hap-
pened in the city the Society for the Preven-
tion of Cruelty to Animals would be around
very speedily. But there is another considera-
tion of perhaps greater moment to the public, to
whom those Western Division lands still belong.
How does country get along that is continually
overstocked? The lands are, generally speaking,
fully stocked in good seasons, and terribly over-
stocked in bad. That is, in the good seasons,
when the country ought to be recovering, it is
not given the opportunity to do so. The con-
sequence is the disappearance of most of the
best fodder-plants, and the survival and spread
■of the useless, often poisonous, weeds which,
;not being fed down, mature and seed. Millions
of acres of country are thus being devastated ;
millions of acres of the public estate are being
.either ruined or permanently injured. Mean-
time, from the sale of wool taken from the
illegitimately-grazed sheep, the Western Divi-
sion squatlages (to a smaller extent, also, those
iin the north-west of the Central Division) arq
nnade to appear very fair assets in the hands of
it lie banks and mortgage companies into which
they have fallen. The thing cannot last, how-
ever. Sheep losses must increase, and the
quality and quantity of wool and frame still
further decline. The policy is only one of
desperation, and is, besides being shortsighted
and also unfair to the landlord, cruel into the
bargain.
The Gaol Deficit.
Judge Hood, of Victoria, struck a great truth,
or at least a small part of it, the other day in a
Melb. robbery case. Prosecutor had come to
town for his annual or semi-annual or quarterly
drunk, and having duly made a beast of him-
self he zig-zagged down a dark lane, where
another man met him and cleaned him out.
The police speiu a good deal of valuable time
hunting for this other man, and when they
got a person who seemed like him he was
acquitted, after a trial that cost about £2O,
for want of sober and reliable evidence,
either for or against him. Whereupon Judge
Hood expressed the opinion, in an irritated
itone, that the law should make all Such prose-
.cutors pay the cost of the trial, on the ground
(that a man who deliberately made a beast of
,himself invited robbery, and thereby was acces-
sory to running the State into great expense.
This theory opens up another and still larger
.question : Why should not the criminal law be
made self-supporting in all its branches? The
■cost of police, gaols, criminal courts, &c., which,
iin New South Wales, runs to over £500,000 a
year, is all incurred through law-breakers, and
therefore it should be the object of every
(Government which wants to be solvent to make
the law-breakers pay for them. As it is they
only pay 8 per cent, of the amount, or less, leav-
ing the other 92 per cent, to be paid by the
people who don’t break the law, which is a
wholly ridiculous state of things. In fact, the
law fines the decent, well-behaved citizen, in
many cases, a great deal more heavily than it
does the habitual criminal, and no one seems to
notice the foolishness of this awful discrepancy.
The present system prescribes a maximum
penalty for each offence, but in most cases it
fixes no minimum, so the average easy-going
magistrate lets the average offender off at ss.
for an aggravated drunk and 40s. for a brutal
assault, and (leaving the question of justice out
.altogether) these rates don’t nearly pay ex-
penses. If the prisoner is sent to gaol the
case is still worse; he is then a dead loss
ifrom beginning to end, as his work
uvhile in confinement seems to be of no value
worth mentioning. Obviously this state of
ithings requires a remedy. When the law
sends a wealthy offender to prison it ought also
ito fine him enough to pay for the use of the
establishment; this may seem hard, but when
the alternative lies between making the law-
breaker or the law-keeper pay the bill, it is
obvious that the former should do so. Also,
some better effort should be made to introduce
paying industries into the gaols and reforma-
tories. And, in addition to this, the scale of
fines wants to be revised on such a liberal scale
that the man who is run in and convicted of a
fineable offence shall pay for the cost of the
policeman, and the lock-up, and his board in
the lock-up while awaiting trial, and the use of
the court-house and magistrate, and something
towards the support of the gaol which has to
be kept up for his benefit in case he should get
worse and go beyond the fineable limit. This
would probably mean raising the minimum
penalty for a very ordinary drunk to £2, and
making £lO the very lowest charge lor a
moderate assault, and fixing the smallest fine
for running an illegal tote at £3OO, and
levying £2O all round for a free fight at Chowder
on a holiday, and charging the influential lawyer
who is let out under the First Offenders Act
£l5O in costs, and doing many other disagree-
able things ; but even this is putting the crime
in at c< si price, and either the fraudulent lawyer
has to pay for his own conviction, or else a
large number of poor but honest people have
to do so on his account. In any case, some-
body has to pay, and the awful deficit has to
be considered. The seven provinces have all
worried much of late years over the Railway
shortage and the Post Office shortage and other
things, while the gaol and police shortage,
which is larger in many cases than all the others
put together, has passed quite unnoticed.
The Law of Seduction.
In another just-settled Melb. jury action, the
glaring anomalies of the suit for seduction have
been laid bare. Apart from the particular
merits of the parties, the case turned on the
question whether the girl could be said to have
been in the service of her father at the moment
of seduction. (This raised another point, viz.,
when was the moment of seduction—the first
fall from virtue ? or the actual cauxa causans of
the lying-in?- but this by the way). A few
illustrations as to what is being in the service
of one’s father and what is not will show the
delightful common sense of this branch of the
law. Where a daughter is in service but
occasionally visits home and is seduced while
on one of these visits, no action will lie. Where
she is in service but sleeps at home, the action
will usually lie. Where she has just left service
and is seduced on her way home, the logical
law puts her by implication in her father’s ser-
vice and gives her father a right of action. If
she lives with her brother but goes every day
to her father’s to do household work, she is
in his service in the meaning of (his law.
In fact, if she is married and living
under her father’s roof and is seduced (?)
he (not her husband) can recover on the ground
that her subsequent confinement, &e., has de-
prived him of services he has no right to. Such
is law. If a parent is well enough off to keep
his daughter at home, and she is seduced, he
can get aggravated damages, for this is one of
the actions in which “station in life” comes
into play. If she is away from home to help
eke out his earnings, he gets nothing if she is
seduced—say, by her employer. Surely the
days of this miserable fiction, “ loss of ser-
vices,” are about over. Give the girl an action
for seduction as in some American states, or
extend the “ maintenance ” law, or give the
father his action on an all-round, fair, demo-
cratic basis, or abolish the distinction between
legitimacy and illegitimacy (which Nature
knows nothing of), or abolish marriage, or take
away the remedy altogether, but, for the sake
of logic and fairness and the sense of humor,
get rid of this ridiculous figure-head of English
prudery, the action quart servitium ami-sit.
Prison Labor.
Item from the new Butler divorce-case :
Mr. Gannon made an application that the case should
be set down about two months ahead, as Butler had just
served his term of solitary confinement; as was usual in
the case of prisoners who had been subjected to this, his
mind and memory had become somewhat affected, and it
took some time before contact with the other prisoners
could restore him mentally.
This is interesting. In other words, the soli-
tary cell is a place for the manufacture of semi-
idiots—people who have vacant stares and
irresponsible gibbers, and who jump at sudden
noises, and grab at the atmosphere for things
that aren’t there, and hang their hands in front
of them when they walk, and shamble feebly
with their legs. A solitary prisoner does no
work, therefore he produces nothing to pay for
his board and lodging. The State pays a large
sum to make him an utterly unsaleable idiot—a
person who is of as little value as possible to
anybody; yet it doesn’t want its own idiot
when he is made, and has no earthly use for
him, and it is always lamenting about the
cost of manufacturing him. There is ob-
viously a weak point in such a system some-
where. One of the principal burdens of the
State is the cost of maintaining gaols, and
one way of reducing this cost is by getting the
largest possible amount of profitable work out
of the prisoners. The community wants this
done, and yet v lienever any attempt is made
at doing it the same community objects on the
ground that gaol-products should not be allowed
to compete with free labor, and thus reduce
wages. Under the Freetrade policy the pro-
ducts of German and Belgian gaols compete
largely with those of N.S. Wales free labor,
and thus reduce local wages, and no attempt is
made to prevent them doing so, but when the
products of local gaols are found doing the
same thing on any scale worth mentioning there
is wild upheaval and riot, and the system is
promptly squelched. The Bulletin would
like to suggest certain reforms in the present
slipshod system. One is that “solitary”
should be abolished —except as a means of sup-
pressing insubordination—on the ground that
it is stupid and brutal, that it produces
nothing save dementia, which isn’t a sale-
able article, and that it leaves idiots and
invalids on the hands of the State to be a
future burden on the revenue. Another is
that N.S. Wales, seeing that it admits foreign
gaol-products freely, might as well give up try-
ing to draw the line at the local article, and
establish in its gaols any industries which don’t
require too much technical skill, and sell the
products in the open market for the benefit of
the revenue. Then, if it employed all prisoners
continuously instead of leaving them to moulder
away for a great part of their time in solitary
confinement, and stimulated them to industry
by allowing each man a small percentage of the
value of his work, with the privilege of spend-
ing it on tobacco or liquor (within certain limits)
or books or other indulgences, it would make
the gaol system a little less expensive and a
great deal less antiquated and barbarous than
it is at present. The number of prisoners is
small at the best, and the possible effects of
prison competition amount to much less than
is commonly supposed, and, in any case, it is
every man’s right to labor, and there is nothing
in the criminal code which takes away that
right. And if gaol-products are abnormally
cheap, N.S. Wales, at all events, has no right
to object on that score. It has voted per-
sistently for Freetrade on the ground that it
wants cheap products.
Adulteration, Shoddy, and False
Pretences.
One of the measures promised this session by
the N.S. W. Government is the comprehensive
Adulteration Act which is so much needed in
the Land of Shoddy. When it comes it will,
The Bulletin hopes, put right at least one old-
established anomaly specially noticeable in the
liquor business. In that trade more than any
other the retailer is .made a scapegoat for the
wholesaler. The smaller dealer in Australian
wine, for example, generally buys the fluid
ready bottled, corked, sealed, and labelled, and
he sells it in that—condition. He can’t tell
what is in the bottles unless he gets the contents
of one of them subjected to an expensive analysis,
which he probably can’t afford to do, and, even
if he does, lie thereby only learns for certain
the nature of the contents of one bottle, and the
rest of the stock remains a mystery, as before.
Yet the law holds him responsible for the
quality of the goods, and fines him if they are
adulterated, and never, or hardly ever, attacks
the wholesale person, who is generally the
responsible party. It does the same with the
owner of the “ tied ” public-house, though he
has to take any liquer which the brewer or
spirit-merchant—who owns him, body, soul,
house, clothes, and boots—chooses to send him.
For some occult reason, it always, or nearly
always, assumes that the man who sells direct
to the public is the guilty party, even
when it is almost a matter of certainty that he
isn’t, and thereby it not only shows itself to
be unfeeling and unjust, but it also misses its
chance to put down the evil it complains of.
The retailer often enough desires to suppress
adulteration, because he is the person who suffers
by it, but in many cases he has to buy from a
dishonest wholesale person, and in others he
can’t find one who isn’t dishonest, and in most
cases he doesn’t know enough to tell whether
the goods he receives are dishonest or not.
Also, if the promised measure is to be a genuine
attempt to extinguish adulteration, it needs to
go beyond the mere question of food and drink
—the point at which most adulteration-laws
stop short. It must heavily penalise the man
who sells “all-wool” goods which are not all
wool, and who sells anything at all which isn’t
what it pretends to be ; also the person who
advertises his own old goods as “ bankrupt
stock ” or as salvage from a sensational fire or
shipwreck—in fact, it wants to attack the whole
question of shoddy and false pretences and
trade dishonesty, or, at least, as much of it as
possible. Adulteration, in the complete sense
of the term, consists in selling or offering for
sale any article which is represented to be what
it is not, and any law which means business will
endeavor to deal with it on that basis.
Writing to a N.S.W. correspondent, Q. ex-
Chief Justice Lilley once more points out the
risks of the British connection—that astound-
ing folly of which only blinding habit could
make Australia guilty :
We depend for peace through our link with Great Bri-
tain on the condition of some madman or fool who has
inherited a European or Oriental throne ! Have we not
fools enough and madmen to drive us to difficulty, danger,
and disaster without continuing the hazard of a plunge
by some distant madman in blood-shedding, in which we
have not even the poor defence of a common interest ?
Why depend for our peace on the Sultan’s pleasure, or a
Fatima or Haidee, or on a “ lapse by Ayesha,” or on the
Czar’s liver or surfeit of cabbage-soup, or on the divine
German Wilhelm’s disgust with “ das Englischer blut” in
his Imperial veins ? It seems absurd that a brave
offshoot from the old English race, with the Scottish
and Celtic mixture, should be at the mercy of
these foreign elements for his right to live in peace
and work out his own great future. Everything
points to the necessity for Australian independent nation-
hood, charged with no further alliance except, perhaps,
for the preservation of the sanctity of the soil of Great
Britain and Ireland from foreign pollution. The latest
scheme for trade and immigration means the discharge
from Russia, Germany, &c., of the alien pauperism which
is crushing the workers of Great Britain. What a precious
mixture we should be —Chinamen, Japs., Hindoos, Kaffirs
and German and Polish Jews, &c., &c. ! We have enough
to do to purge out the convict taint from Australia with-
out entering on the benevolent work of relieving Europe
of her surplus poverty and crime ! Australians should
look steadily to their own interests, and by no means
allow any obstacle to be placed between them and the
government of their own affairs in an independent
nationality.
A Bulletin correspondent on Vandemonian
politics :
The difference between the Ins and the Outs in Tas.
Parliament is more personal than political. The present
Braddon-Fysh Govt, advocates and collects an Income-
tax, a tax on the capital value of land, exempting im-
provements, and doesn’t shut down on the consultation
promoter or blame Braddon overmuch for attaching his
name to the prospectus of the Anchor tin-mine. The
Dobson-Lewis (dual leaderships are fashionable just now)
Opposition is understood to barrack for a graduated tax
on land and improvements, opposes the Income-tax
apologetically (as Ministers apologise for not opposing it),
is silent re consultations, and attacks the Premier
personally for dragging his name, as Premier,
in the mire of the Anchor muddle. Politically,
there is no difference worth mentioning in the
two programmes, especially as neither side has
ever made clear to the common people what
brand of land-tax either really aims at. The only
apparent chance of an agitation of the stagnant pool of
Tas. politics lies in Opposition-leader Dobson’s latest
declaration for a wealth-tax. This declaration, it is fair
to say, was made while endeavoring to explain the
benefits of his particular brand of Land-tax such
a hopeless task that the National Ass catch-word
proved a godsend to the befogged politician talking
to a still more befogged audience—and modifications
of the statement may be confidently expected. It is
hardlv reasonable to suppose that any political party in Tas.
Legislature would so far depart from ancient tradition as
to adopt a programme involving direct and violent oppo-
sition to any other party in the House, but if the Opposi-
tion really means what it says, and is prepared to pin its
faith to the wealth-tax advocated by the various National
Asses, it is a hopeful sign. The advent of healthy convic-
tions of any sort in Tas. politics would mark an advance
almost amounting to revolution. If the large red hand of
Fatman, as displayed in the wealth tax, is seriously
grasped by the Dobson-Lewis combination, and the Minis-
try makes a similar departure from tradition by sticking
to its present programme, the latter should score at the
polls, despite the Anchor trouble and the clatter the reli-
gionists are likely to make over the toleration displayed
by the Braddon-Fysh Government towards the wicked
Tattersall.
A section of the Victorian press has risen
to demand that the public shall not make
such a fuss about Baxter, and Rapiport, the
J’s.P. whom the Former Board found guilty of
corruption, on the ground that there are many
others quite as bad as they. “ A great show of
virtuous indignation,” says one paper, “has
been made about Baxter and Rapiport, as if
they alone were blameworthy.” In one sense,
of course, the show of indignation is rather
ridiculous; i.e., if it stops at Baxter and
Rapiport it will be ridiculous. But when it is
implied that these two should receive more con-
sideration than they otherwise would because
others who may or may not be equally guilty
have not yet been formally arraigned, the
argument breaks down badly. If the man who
is found out is to receive special consideration
because others have not been formally found
out, then Deeming should have been let off
because other murderers are still at large, and
every criminal should escape because other
criminals of the same sort have evaded dis-
covery. In fact, nobody should be punished
except the very last offender of all, and he
would have to be let off because the others had
been; and the suppression of crime would
never begin at all. Nobody ever applies this
process of reasoning to burglars, garrotters,
sneak-thieves, pickpockets and the like ; even
though a hundred burglars escape capture the
law comes down on the hundred-and-first
without the slightest consideration. And if
there are 100 unjust J’sP. in Victoria, which
seems quite probable, and the law has really
found two of them, that is a good reason why it
should do all it knows to find the other 98, but
for the two it is no apology or excuse whatever.
What is really wanted by the people who take
up this line of argument is that the law should
forget the two men it has definitely on hand in
an aimless hustle after other men whose names
and addresses are not given, and against whom
there seems to be at present no legal evidence
—in other words, it is invited to drop the bone
by wild cries that the shadow is running away.
Crick and M'Millan are substantially at one
on the glaring ineptitude of maintaining the
N.S.W. Postmaster-Generalship in its present
state. In no sense of the word is it, or should
it be, a political office, and the way in whicli it
has usually been filled proves that Ministries
generally look on it as a gift to some special
industry or clique or organisation, in expecta-
tion of receiving an amount of covertly-exercised
political influence in return. It is in turns
presented to a water party and a liquor party,
an Orange party and a Green party, a stolid
neutral party and an aggressive Labor party,
and the individual selected, admittedly without
any conception of the character of his duties or
any special ability to discharge them if he knew
what they were, quietly goes on pocketing
,£l5OO a year while his Government hangs
together. The billet in Australia is a repro-
duction of the English system, and is surrounded
with most of the evils which adhere to the office
there It extends the area of a Premier’s
patronage ; it puts in his hands a means of
stopping the mouths of malcontents and exciting
the gratitude of time-servers ; while all along
the taxpayers have to bleed for the perform*
anee.
Dear Bulletin, —Some Australian Judges are
rapidly building up a reputation for utterly
purposeless cruelty. In addition to two alto-
gether illogical sentences inflicted recently by
Judge Hodges, Judge Hood, at April Criminal
Sessions, ladled cut terms of solitary confine-
ment with a liberal hand. To one man he
awarded two years’ hard labor, and to three
others eighteen months, in addition to which
each and every sentence included one week’s
solitary in every alternate month right up to
the end of the sentence —to the eighteenth
month in the case of the two years’ sentence.
Possibly Judge Hood is not aware of the full
effect of this merciless punishment. It means
being locked in a cell 15ft. by 7ft. by 12ft. high,
from which all furniture save a stool has been
removed, from Monday morning at 6 o’clock till
the following Monday, excepting one hour per
day for exercise (also solitary). During the
whole of this time the prisoner gets only lib. of
brown bread per day—let anyone weigh out a
pound of damp brown bread and see what
a handful it is—and water. He is only
allowed the Bible and one religious work, pro-
bably a Sunday at Home —no other book what-
ever ; and —refinement of cruelty ! —he is not
allowed to work, even to pick oakum. In
addition to this, every three days of solitary
lengthens his sentence (by decreasing the
remission) by one day, as he can earn no marks
for work. I would stake my immortal soul
that one week’s “solitary” would make most
Victorian Judges drivelling idiots—or religious
maniacs ; and when one considers the physical
effects of seven days’ semi-starvation .on an
already weakened frame at the beginning of
every other month, it is safe to say that Judge
Hood has by this action shortened this man’s
life by years, in addition to further breaking-up
his already none-too-sound mental powers.
Truly when the English hung men for sheep-
stealing they were more merciful than Judge
Hood in thus punishing men for larceny.—
Victorian Justice.
Dear Bulletin,— “ Shark ” pleads for the
adoption of the English Judicature Acts, on
the ground that some of the law’s delays would
thereby be removed. No such thing would or
could happen. Practitioners know well that it
takes but a comparatively short time to arrive
at the ready-for-hearing stage, but after that
the chances are strong that the present Judges
would not be able to complete their work in
their allotted time—then over goes the case for
weeks or months. It would be as wise to lay
the blame on the coal when an engine does not
work beyond its full capacity. Again, the old
system is more concise, and just as free from
technicalities. For example : “ I deny the
allegations contained in paragraph 8,” does
not, under this wonderfully modern system,
deny such allegations at all. The pleader must
deny them specifically. It’s a case of the lesser
evil, after all. — Another Man-Eater.
The Sunday section of N.S.W. Licensing law,
although so generally defied, is right into the
hands of the informer and police-tout. The
other day a man was fined ss. for being found
in the act of leaving a Cook’s River (Sydney)
hotel with liquor in his possession. And the
hotelkeeper was fined £2. Anyone can see how
easily a hotelkeeper may be victimised under
such a law. A man may, under any of a thou-
sand pretexts, make his way into a hotel and
emerge with a flask, carried about with him for
the purpose. This, in fact, happened in Eng-
land, until the law there was repealed in t his
respect, and now a person must actually be
found drinking on the premises or with drink be-
fore him. In a late case a bottle was found on a
man, and a constable swore he saw the man go in,
and a sergeant and constable swore they saw him
come out of a gin-palace, but the court decided
that these facts did not constitute “finding”
him on the premises, and so there was no case.
All residential hotels are open on Sundays, the
public bar alone excepted, and as everyone may
walk over the premises, what is to prevent in-
former or perjurer, with a flask in his pocket,
from putting the landlord under the grip of the
police ? A first-class hotel has generally a
means of defying persecution like this, but
small, one-horse places in back streets have no
means. And the record of the cases which
reach the N.S.W. courts shows that 99 out of
100 are concerned with the one-horse pubs.

“Trilby” is getting along the same as
reported last week, and the gruesomeness of
Svengali grows more and more upon the
kind of spectator who loves artistic gruesome-
ness. There is a crawlsome fascination about
that man of grime and melody, and people
go home to dream about him, and then come
back to see him again and to dream some
more. And in their dreams Svengali wanders
oyer them throughout the silent watches of the
night after the manner of an alligator with un-
clean dishcloths on his feet, and the memory of
his grimy paws as they dance over the keys of the
piano suggests a family of serpents bounding on the
washstand. Trilby’s feet, however, have not grown
upon this paper since the last report appeared.
They are still the same pair of good, ordinary,
wholesome, every-day feet that they were before,
and it doesn’t believe that they will ever look like
anything else. Also, the pictured foot on the
wall—which was apparently done by Trilby stand-
ing on a chair on top of a table while her under-
standing was outlined by Billee —is nothing
especially astonishing. Trilby is a remarkably
nice girl, taking her all round, but a too-careful
analysis of the lady doesn’t yield such good results
as might be expected—she needs to be taken in
the “ altogether,” and taken that way she is quite
satisfactory. Last week The Bulletin objected
to Little Billee in a general sort of way, and now,
after seven days spent in inspecting and boiling
down its feelings with regard to that unsatisfac-
tory character, it believes the trouble is mainly
that he looks too old and hard and wrinkled for
the part. It would take a lot of ability to prevent
Bill looking sketchy and weak, for the part itself
has just about nothing and a half in it; anyhow the
whole reason of Bill is that he should be a nice,
enthusiastic boy unspoiled by drink or late hours
or bad tobacco, or knowledge of the Flossie that
leadeth to destruction, and the present individual
isn’t. A lady ought to have been put on the
job. One thing is certain —“ Trilby ”is not quite
the f urore in Sydney which this paper expected.
Probably the people who like to be fascinated by
the high art of Reuben Fax, and to dream of an
unbathed spectre crawling over them in the night,
are only sufficient to fill half the Lyceum, and the
other half is reserved for the people who want to
fail in love with Trilby’s feet, and part of this
second crowd is either disappointed with the feet,
or doesn’t see them long enough—they are only on
view about seven minutes, or it wants the calves
as well, and so stays away. The show is doing
well in a plain, ordinary way, but it was expected
to bulge out the universe, and unfortunately it
isn’t bulging any universe.

Mahomet, the talking horse, has again
placed himself on the bill at Fitzgerald Bros.’
circus, and business is all that any horse can
desire. Mahomet was more or less off the bill for
some days, having briefly intimated his intention
of taking a rest, and when he does this it is not
advisable to press him too hard, else he might
send in his resignation on the spot, and give up
circus business, and take to lecturing. One evi-
dence of the interest which Australia takes in
everything connected with horse lies in the fact
that the front gate of the circus opens now at 6.30
—performance beginning at 8. And people
actually rush in at 6.30, and look at the monkeys
with one eye for ninety minutes, while the other
eye is fixed on the seats to make dead sure that
they won’t be crowded out and not get a good
view of Mahomet, after all. And when a full-
grown citizen has got into his 75th minute of con-
tinuous looking at the monkeys, he is a saddening
spectacle.

Tennyson and O’Gorman have been added
to the cast at Sydney Tivoli, and, with the aid of
Charles Godfrey and the other people, they put in
a moist and miserable holiday-season with good
results.

“The Derby Winner,” which the writer
suspected on insufficient grounds of intending to
appear at Sydney Royal last week, is definitely
announced for Saturday. This estimable animal
is also quite new to Australia, and, his opponents
being palpably stiff, he is going to win the classic
event each night for the ensuing three weeks or so.

On Saturday Pinero’s ‘ ‘ Benefit of the
Doubt ” is to be staged at Sydney Criterion, being
its first production in the land of the wattle-poem
and the drought. Meanwhile, the “New Woman”
has been doing well, though not by any means so
well as that bright and festive outbreak deserved.
The last month of the B. and B. co’s last season is
now on, and an advt., which reads like the epitaph
of our best suicided friend, states that four weeks
hence the co. will be disbanded. This circum-
stance certainly ought to make Sydney roll up as
one man to drop the beautiful tear of sentiment
in the vestibule and up the red-carpeted stairs,
but somehow it doesn’t roll up any more than
usual. Presumably the beautiful tear of senti-
ment is off.

That very old drama, “Across the Con-
tinent,” which died out of the memory of Sydney
playgoers some 15 years ago, and is now about as
new again as if it was only written yesterday, was
dug out from beneath its dusty pyramid and
staged this week at Her Majesty’s. Said aged
production is so exactly like the drama of to-day
in its disconnectedness and its cheerful disregard
of law and probability, that it is evident the art of
writing the big dramatic horror hasn't advanced
much of late years. The boss Indian addresses
his accomplices at great length in a loud shriek
right up against the front door of the palefaces
they are going to surprise, and then tells them at
the top of his brassy voice to be silent and cautious
—just as he has kept on doing ever since. The
bad man is gaoled on the bare assertion of the
good man that it was he who did it—what he did
isn’t even explained. The drama contains
about the most realistic express train ever
seen on the stage, and a most desper-
ately unrealistic Indian scrimmage, in the
course of which all the parties tow each other
round by the hair. The rest is partly infuriated
but superfluous organ - grinder, nigger - minstrel
show, and public-house murder; partly a faint
recollection of a woman who was fatally thrown
down a stair 18 years before by a callous publican,
and whose husband died in the horrors ; partly a
story about a person who was convicted on false
evidence before the drama opened, and who tracks
his accuser with dreadful patience for years and
years, till at last he finds him and shakes him a
good deal in a public-house ; and partly a young
man who forged a cheque previous to the beginning
of the story, and whose position is explained by
the wicked character talking to himself after the
sandwich - man is gone. Alfred Woods has a
good deal to do with the unrolling of this
tale of woe ; so have Messrs. Hodson, Booth-
man, Ryan, and Hosea Easton ; likewise Misses
Lilia Wilde, Edith Barrow, and Mrs. Marshall.
These and the locomotive are about all the people
whose connection with it can bear inspection. A
lot of time is taken up by a prologue, which shows
the heroine’s father, whom nobody cares about,
dying of drink 18 years previously; and the vil-
lain’s father, who never turns up again in the
drama, playing cards with two men who are no
more heard of; and two other people, who
straightway drop right out of the narrative,
bringing victuals to the heroine’s mother who
isn’t mentioned any more after that. This sort of
irrelevance is painful.

Pastor Haskett Smith has been telling his
stories of Syria and Palestine, and the other
lands of dirt and glitter and old romance which
lie about the eastern end of the Great Sea, to
food audiences at Sydney Y.M.C.A. TTa.ll. The
■ulletin loves Parson Smith in some of his
aspects. He casts a pleasant glamor over the
camel-smelling cities and dog-and-fly-infested
towns, and the thirsty, dreamy wilds, of that land
where nothing seems to be real save the tax-
gatherer and the atrocity. He knows the over-
laden Oriental ass and the city mongrel by heart,
and he is acquainted with the crooked streets and
the water-carrier and the alleged Fatima, and he
has cultivated the dervish, and, in a general sort
of way, the place has soaked into him. And
anybody who is thoroughly acquainted with
anything is so very rare that it is no small
pleasure to meet an intelligent and intelligible
person with something really soaked into him.
It is only needful to steep Parson Smith in warm
water for about 30 minutes, and then take him out
and put him aside to dry, and large quantities of
information about the East will be found in the
tub from which he has been extricated.

“ Silver King,” as produced by the enter-
prising Westmacott, at Melbourne Royal, exceeds
expectation by several inches. This is a better
all-round rendering of the old story than some
that have gone before. Also, the show is bright
with new scenery, and radiant with financial suc-
cess, and boomsome in spirit and in truth. Bul-
letin belief in the comparative greatness of
“ Silver King ” remains. No work of its class has
rivalled the literary melodrama which Jones and
Herman sprang upon a weary world 14 years ago.
Other clever collaborators tried to do the same sort
of thing in the same happy way, but never quite
managed to get there, and melodrama, after
awhile, relapsed into evil ways under the iron rule
of the stage-carpenter. One finds no living
bridges, thunderbolts, conflagrations, horse-leaps,
or dynamite explosions in “Silver King.” An
awful railway calamity is reported in the evening
paper, but the accident doesn’t obtrude itself upon
public notice in the form of a tableau. The most
ingenious sensational incident on record was
deliberately shut out from view by the authors,
and has never been missed. Their story is the
more interesting for not being decorated with a
picture of its all-important event.
* * * *
Scot Inglis makes a very likeable Denver
all the time; he doesn’t whine in his cups, or
preach in his penitence, and, although he might
put a little more force into his discovery of the
dead body and subsequent flight from the police,
he comes through at the finish with honors thick
upon him. Miss Harrie Ireland likewise puts
a pleasing performance to her credit, and Elton’s
Jaikes is a valuable addition to the company. In
some respects Elton outshines Royce and Phil.
Day, who were older and droller Jaikeses than he.
Certainly his present treatment of the character is
more hearty than his original attempt, which
seems, by the way, to have faded out of recollec-
tion. Plimmer, as the Spider, errs on the side of
quiet naturalism, and Hazlitt, as housebreaker
Cripps, shouts too gently. J. W. Sweenev
(Father Christmas), Hans Phillips, Miss Gill, and
little Daisy Ireland shine forth, and among the
minor character-players, most of whom are very
good, Miss Reynolds (as Tabitha) proves particu-
larly useful in her amorous designs upon the aged
Dan’l. “ Silver King ” will prosper until furtner
notice.

The Alexandra bill for this week is a well-
meaning drama of bucolic disposition, called “On
the Wrong Track.”, Its human interest seems to
spring from a mysterious mixing of babies, and
when the infants are unravelled the entertainment
comes to an impressive close, the villain having
previously fallen with complete success from a
house-top. Augustus Glover, pretty Miss Blair,
and Wilson Forbes are satisfactory features in a
loiig cast. The trouble is mounted with consider-
able attention to small details, and a wholesome
smell Qf farmyard and arable land is expressed by
the leather leggings of several male performers.
*# * *
The direful failure of “ Miss Decima,” at
Melbourne Princess’s, was followed on Saturday
by a revival of “In Town,” which apparently
gave full satisfaction to a full house. “In Town ”
is in many places a comic opera rather than a
musical comedy, and possibly the new people
make it go as far as the “Gaiety Girl ” company
did a year ago. Comparisons between two different
ways of telling the same joke must always be a
matterof opinion. The writer prefers the otherway,
but without denying that the new performance is
harmonious. Miss Juliet Wray is quite as much like
an ex-governess in a duke’s family as George Lauri
resembles the typical captain who lives on his wits
and smart appearance. And Miss Florence Young
might be taken for a young lordling by anyone
who could accept Miss Nina Osborne as a Maud
Montressor. There is only one more week for the
Comic Opera Co. to stay at the Princess’s (on June
6th they sail for Maoriland —76 souls in all), and
“ In Town ” may last until the arrival of Mrs.
Brown-Potter and Bellew.

The first day of the Theatrical Carnival
at Melbourne Exhibition Building was not
brilliantly festive. Seventy distinct bicycle ex-
hibits, when they come to be viewed in cold blood,
are more entertaining than one bike, and the con-
templation of one blessed Nimrod-Zimmy in a
quiescent state grows monotonous after a time.
This year’s Carnival was not, of course, given over
entirely to bicycle, nevertheless it seemed to be
unduly weighted with pneumatic tires and patent
gears. Worse than that, the opening day was
damp and dreary, and the influential citizens who
had formerly come along with several shillings to
spend in sweet nonsense, didn’t roll up freely on
this occasion. The Bulletin hopes they arrived
on Monday afternoon and evening. There were
humorous and pathetic circumstances to be found
here and there. Marie Luella, standing behind a
circular counter, confronted by a tract of desola-
tion and smiling mechanically at nobody at all,
was a sorrowful sight. At another counter the
announcement, “Juliet Wray,” was painted on a
vast piece of calico, beneath which Juliet’s sister
figured in lieu of her relative, with the result that
the public in general said she wasn’t “as thin as
The Bulletin made out. ” Another funny mis-
take happened in the space reserved for the Opera
House company. La Belle Maie had charge of
an American gambling apparatus, which she
was working for a time on an unprofitable
system. Money could be staked on either of six
numbers, and any investor was bound to win if he
backed every number for the same amount—or so
the story went around. Anyway, the little lady
who had undertaken to run this novel concern in
the cause of charity, was observed to glance at it
with growing suspicion every time she set the
wheel in motion, and found herself a loser when
she settled up.
At Poverty Point.
Jennie Reiffarth’s account of how she met Dan Barry :
“ I was taking it easy and comfortable at the Oriental
Hotel (Melb.) without my corsets (with the accent on the
sets) when they rung me up on the telephone and wanted
to know if I could go to the Alexandra Theatre at once.
I knew that was engaged there in a subordinate
capacity, and I thought ‘ Heavenly Father ! he’s met with
an accident, and I’m the only American he knows.’ I got
inside my corsets and a hansom, and drove round to the
Alexandra, only to find , whom I expected to see
in fragments, waiting on the curbstone. ‘ Madame
Reiffarth, this is Mr. Barry. He thought that you would
•like to see an Australian rehearsal of “Uncle Tom’s
Cabin.” He’ ‘ Well, I’m ! Is this why I had
to put on my corsets ? ’ ”
The hat-kicking business in the studio-dance scene of
“ Trilby ” was interpolated, it is said, at manager William-
son’s suggestion. They might as well work up the inci-
dent into a contest, and have the bride-elect put a comic
crown, or something, on the head of the highest kicker.
Haddon Chambers is hard at work again, Sir Blarney
Tomato having gone to South Africa, says The Bulletin’s
London correspondent. His next play will probably be
seen at the Adelphi, but it is unsafe to prophecy any-
thing that the Gattis will do. They usually keep their
own counsel well.
Sturdy Harwood is in evidence again. He first trod the
boards in Sydney, with the tuition of G. V. Brooke.
Lawrence’s memoir of the tragedian includes a letter from
Brooke to Heir, his Melb. manager, warning him that
salaries must be cut down, “ except Lambert and Har-
wood. ’ But alas for the prudent ant that won’t act like
the grasshopper! Here is Harwood toiling at the oar,
and Dick Stewart in harness too as treasurer of the Melb
Princess’s.
“ M iss Decima” did not catch on in Melbourne. How
could it? The piece pivoted on Juliet Wray’s deter-
mination not to marry anyone but a young man who had
accidentally seen her legs. This was taking public
credulity too much. Is it conceivable that any young
man would want to marry the thin young person after
seeing those legs ?
Juliet Wray’s engagement has still some time to run
and the story that she goes to England in May is founda-
tionless.
The tour of the last Gaiety Co. through ’Murka and
Australia has been chronicled in book form by Granville
Bantock (the musical conductor) and F. G. Affalo. Pre-
sumed that Affalo is either Blauche Massey’s Greek dude
—Greek slave sounds better—or the massive Monkhouse
ui disguise. The book is a dreary flow of small beer,
which nobody outside the co. would care to bathe his in-
tellect in.
What Juliet Wray is responsible for. The Jewish Melb
amateurs have arranged for six operatic nights at the
B>Jou when the little Flegeltaubs are to flutter by the
bushel. W llliamson is to come round, with a handful of
engagements. Bless you, Juliet is not a circumstance to
Miriam and Rachel.

The property man of a theatrical co., visiting Cool-
gardie, went to a broker to get some used-up mining-
scrip to do duty as stage bank-notes. “ All the scrip in

pay you to take away,” said the broker.
Fax omits Beerbohm-Tree’s greatest scene. It is where
Svengali, feeling his magnetism on the ebb, kneels and
prays, a situation evidently prompted by the King in
“ Hamlet.” But a Jewish paper says the kneel is out of
character.
Ada Crossley, although invariably praised for her sing-
ing by the Hinglish press, is not yet a great popular
attraction. She hasn’t, thus far, been able to identify her
name with any new favorite songs, and, until she can do
that, the Australian contralto will not command “star”
prices.
Phil. Greenwood, who went ’Ome with the Eleven as a
cricket-reporter, also on theatrical business for W. andM.,
took with him a smart comic opera by two Melbourne
men, which may possibly get a show in London. Bar-
rister O’Hara Wood did the libretto, and Nesbitt, the Ask
musical critic, furnished the score.
The cast playing “Charley’s Aunt,” now in its fourth
year at London Globe, are sick to death of Brandon
Thomas’s farcical comedy. Their “lines” have lost
nearly all meaning for them, and are mumbled and muti-
lated out of recognition. Yet the piece draws and pays
well. The agreement with the owners states that it is not
to be withdrawn until the house is losing money.
Westmacott’s production of “ Silver K<ng” at Melb.
Royal, may fairly claim to be the worthiest show, all
things considered, ever staged in Australia at popular
prices.
Re Sappho Smith’s assumption that the name of Trader
(Zou-Zou) is unmistakeably Yankee, a Mr. Trader, of Bal-
larat, claims that his English great-grandfather founded
the Trader family by dropping two letters from his
original name of Threader. Several of his paternal
ancestor’s sons went to America, and “ Geo. A. Trader is
a branch of the same family,” writes a Ballarat cor-
respondent. However, seeing that Zou-Zou first came to
light in the North of England, he can’t be an American
branch of any family. Also, if the first English Trader
had formerly been a Threader, whilst the first ’Murkan
Traders never owned a different patronymic, the name
seems to be more Yankee than otherwise. And if it isn’t
—no matter. It has an unmistakably Yankee appearance,
anyhow.
Florence, the younger sister of Kate, Ellen and Marion
Terry, is the first of the famous family to pass away.
Florence Terry had begun to be recognised as a clever

May 25th, Oscar Wilde completed the first year of his

One of the matters which burst up Chaffey
Brothers, Limited, was evidently the London office. The
London management sold land and shares to the extent
of £'85,000, and borrowed £34,000, and “ blewed ” £40,000
in expenses while doing it. This sort of London manage-
ment was calculated to bring down almost any enter-
prise. The second issue of debentures, floated by the
London office, realised £14,900 and £10,155 of this went
in expenses, so that the co. only got £4745 and owed
£14,900. The biggest asset in the balance-sheet is “ Con-
cessions, £438,094,” which is practically the goodwill of a
hopelessly-bankrupt concern, so it may as well be dropped
out. The concessions represent the right of taking up
438,094 acres provided the co. can do the needful irriga-
tion works upon the land, and as the co. can’t do anything
of the kind this item is practically dead. The next biggest.
item is “ Freehold Land £290,980 ” (16,000 acres at
£l2 and 24,745 acres at £4 an acre). This land
isn’t worth anything like the price set against it
unless the present irrigation works can be kept up, and
extended, and it is very doubtful if they can be. More-
over, it isn’t worth anything unless it can be sold, and as
the co., in the height of its glory and prosperity, only
managed to sell a little over 21,000 acres in eight years,
and part of this area has since been forfeited, the pros-
pect of getting rid of any more is very dubious indeed.
Practically, these two assets (£729,074 in all) look about
equally hopeless. Of the uncalled capital (£239,000) about
£160,000 has vanished with Geo. Chaffey’s insolvency, and
some of the other holders look so very unpromising that
this asset may also be mostly dismissed from consideration.
Of such assets as there are, a large number are specifically
pawned to different institutions, and the rest are pawned
tn masse to the debenture-holders, and there are not
enough left free to pay the cost of keeping the big irriga-
tion pump going ten minutes.
The two London co’s which guaranteed payment
of the debentures have both burst. Among the alleged
assets of Chaffey Bros., Limited, are 3615 shares in the
Mildura Coffee Palace, but as these have a liability of
£1174 on them, they look more like a dead loss. The
Vic. mortgagees, including a number of banks and one or
two insurance societies, seem to have a pleasing prospect
before them, for the settlement can only keep afloat by
the payment of very heavy irrigation rates, and if they
foreclose they will have to pay these rates together with
all arrears of same, and comply with the cultivation con-
ditions, and otherwise keep moving. Altogether there
doesn’t seem to be much of a prospect in the Chaffey
enterprise for anybody.
* * * *
The S.M. Herald says the awful revelations in
the case of Chaffey Bros., Limited, are “ very unfortunate
for the cause of irrigation.” Echo arises and says :
“ Why ? ” Irrigation had nothing whatever to do with
the smash of the Mildura co. That dreadful concern
made something like 15 per cent, per annum on the money
actually invested in the works, and if the co. had been a
legitimate affair, decently managed and working on its
own capital, it would have paid magnificently. But when
a lot of the working capital cost 44 per cent, in office-
expenses alone to procure, and 5 per cent, interest and 3
per cent, discount in addition, and when the co. borrowed
money at 8 and 10 per cent, and paid 5 per cent, more to
the man who guaranteed repayment, making the rates 13
and 15—that had nothing whatever to do with irrigation.
The irrigation business was all right.

The fight between the debenture-holders and
the Maoriland Government re the ownership of the Mid-
land Railway is getting nearly due. The Government is
running the little fragment of line, pending a definite
settlement, on behalf of the owners, whoever they may
be, and now that the co. is ruined, and its astounding
claim for damages is disposed of, the debenture-holders
apparently are the owners. Nobody is quite sure about
this, but it looks like it. The State must acquire the line
some day for several reasons. The railway must be finished
because the country needs it. The debenture-holders
can’t finish it, nor can they work it. The State can’t
always run a line which is its own at both ends and some-
body else’s in the middle. Therefore, either the State
must own the private line sooner or later, or else build
its own line alongside, and let the existing dislocated
fragment go to rust. The debenture-holders have a lien
—or think they have—of £825,000 on less than 80 miles of
railway, much of it unequipped, and if the State takes it
over at that price it will cost in cash alone over £lO,OOO
a mile, which is wholly absurd, seeing that the State lines
were built and equipped for £7703 per mile. The
£350,000 or so which Maoriland has already paid
in land would make the total nearly £15,000 a mile,
but that £350,000 was paid to the dead co., and has no
connection with the debenture-holders’ lien. The Govern-
ment, however, has one advantage. If the debenture-
holders won’t come to terms, it can work the line on their
account for a good many years yet, and present its bill for
the loss every half-year, and keep on doing so till they get
tired and make a reasonable offer, or till it is time to
seize the property by verdict of the Small Debts Court, in
payment of the accumulated losses. Meanwhile, the old
co., despite the decision of the arbitrator that it hadn’t a
leg to stand upon, is still raging over the length and
breadth of Bull-land about the “disgraceful swindle”
perpetrated upon it; and the debenture-holders say they
want their £825,000 in full, immediately ; and Premier
Seddon smiles and waits. It is an interesting situation.

The Federal Building, Land and Investment
Society of Brisbane presents a report which shows it is
making some attempt to tackle its difficulties. A year
ago its properties stood in the balance-sheet at their old
boom-values and professed to represent £102,655. Then
the shareholders wisely decided to admit that the boom
was dead and the values mostly paper, and they wrote
this item down to £62,083 ; wrote down the capital from
£107,186 to £38,340 ; and added £BOOO (out of the written-
down capital) to reserve, making it £20,000, to provide
for further possible losses in the future. In addition to
these disasters, it appears that the total receipts for the
year just ended were £5248, and the expenditure was
£7845, and as the concern thus went to the bad by
£2597 it will probably want all the provision for
future losses it can make. So far as appears, the
whole revenue from £llB,OOO worth of investments
doesn’t even yield enough to pay interest on £50,000
of deposits, debentures, and bank overdraft, so either
the investments must be tolerably bad or the inter-
est on the borrowed money must be remarkably steep, or
both. The salaries, office expenses, &c., are all dead loss,
there being no revenue to meet them after interest is
paid. If the Federal was working solely on its own money
it could pay a 5 per cent. div. and have something left
even now, but the boom custom of borrowing vast sums
at (apparently) 7 per cent, and buying properties with
them that only yield (apparently) 2j per cent, when the
bad time oomes, has left it with no prospects w'orth men-
tioning.

Melbourne Grand Coffee Palace Co. reports a
profit of £126 for the year ended 31st March. About four
shillings per cent. , * *
The steady-going Bank of Adelaide shows a net
profit for the year ended 31st March of £31,225, compared
with £31,048 at March, ’95. A 7 per cent. div. uses up
£28,000 ; £3OOO is added to reserve, making it £152,0uu ,
and £225 is added to profit and loss, making the balance
£15,514. During the past year the little bank has boomed
greatly. Deposits have increased by £464,000 ; cash on
hand has improved by £74,000; and note circulation,
Govt, debentures, and other items have also increased.
The cash and State debentures total £760,000, which, for
so small an institution, is a remarkably solid line of de-
fence. The Bank of Adelaide is the only survivor of the
four S.A. banks of a very few years ago, and, judging from
appearances, it is one of the most solid financial institu-
tions left in this continent.

In Melbourne, recently, three interesting usury
cases were heard in one day. In one case, the plaintiff, a
female money-lender, advanced £5O on a P N, interest £l5
for each month, or part of a month, until paid—something
like 360 per cent, per annum. Also, she advanced £2O at
the rate of £lO interest for 16 days, and the same for
every succeeding 16 days—something like 1150 per cent,
per annum. In another case, another money-lender re-
ceived £l2 a year, for four years, as interest on £l5, and,
after getting £4B interest, he proceeded to sue for the
principal. Evidently there is plenty of scope in Victoria
for a law fixing a maximum rate of interest—such a law
as prevails in all, or almost all, of the United States, and
as the Seddon Government promises in Maoriland.

Permewan, Wright and Co., Limited, announce
that the net profits for 1895, after allowing £lOOO for
depreciation, were £2051, and as the 10per cent, dividend
absorbed £3750, the concern went 11699 to leeward dur-
ing the year. The yearning to pay 10 per cent, under all
circumstances is a very solemn thing indeed.

Melbourne Storage Co., a concern with illo,ooo
capital, which makes a year’s profit of £29, publishes a
balance-sheet with at least one interesting item in it. One
of its assets is freehold property (less £52,556 mortgages),
£65,485. A footnote adds that this must be regarded as a
liability rather than an asset. Therefore, it would appear
that the value is simply a book-value, and that the pre-
sent worth of the property, over and above the mort-
gage, is nil. And yet the co. still inserts it as a large
asset. There is something refreshing about the idea of
issuing a balance-sheet with a footnote stating that some
of the principal figures must not be relied upon.

The Tasmanian Permanent Executors and Trus-
tees Association plods on in its unprogressive little way.
This half-year it made £494, and after paying a little div.
at 6 per cent, per annum on its little capital of £lO,OOO it
was £194 to the good. Last half it made £297, and after
paying its little div. it was £3 to the bad. For the half
ended March, ’95, it made £356 and was £56 ahead of its
dividend ; at Sept., ’94, it made only £265, and after pay-
ing the same old dividend it was £35 on the wrong side.
After 8)4 years it has no reserve-fund, and never seems
likely to have any, and its whole accumulations only
reach t 573. Altogether, this is about the smallest, sad-
dest, least exciting way of doing the trustee business im-
aginable.

A recent demand for Melb. Met. Gas shares is
now accounted for by a sudden spring of 9d. per 1000 ft.
in the co.’s gas-rate. Another turn of the screw was
meditated, the excuse offered to the writhing consumer
being the coal-strike. Nobody has quite enough inno-
cence to suppose that the ring’s increase in the price of
coal justifies the Bd. rise in gas, but it serves at least to
give an air of decency to the situation. Gas-consumers
in general are aware that coal has gone up. If they were
as generally aware that gas : shares had hardened on the
fact of coal becoming dearer they might protest against
the system which enables Fat Man to wring extra profit
from' a public loss. The Gas Co. charges househo.ders
with the advance in its coal bill, plus shixty per shent, or
thereabouts.

Melb. District Police-court decided last Friday
that electric-light co’s have no power to recover either for
electric-light supplied or rent of meters. The ground of
the decision was that it is necessary for such co’s to
obtain a special order in Council to authorise either con-
struction of lines or the supply of electric-light. The
Melb. City Council, which competes with private electric-
lighting enterprise, is specially authorised, but the pri-
vate limited co’s will either have to shut down for six
weeks or so until the order in Council is granted, or trust
to their customers’ good faith to pay up. Either alterna-
tive will mean a serious loss to both co’s, which have only
just emerged from the dead-horse stage.

If the strike doesn’t kill Newcastle (N.S.W.)

The Brabloch reached ’Frisco April 7 with her cargo in
flames, and had to be scuttled in harbor ; and the Repub-
lic, bound for same port, took fire at sea on April 10 and
had to be abandoned—the crew being luckily saved by a
passing vessel. The percentage of Newcastle missing
ships is now so heavy that insurance is difficult to get on
any terms, and owners are beginning to fight shy of the

Money must be tight in Melbourne when the
local Herald can publish this sort of stuff under the head
of cable news “ Left to the Heirs. A Handsome For-
tune. London, Friday Night. The will of the late Mr.
Thomas Harbottle has been lodged for probate. The per-
sonality is declared at £28,496.” A special correspondent
who goes forth in the night (especially a Friday night) to
wire tidings of a £28,000 probate can’t be moving in very
plutocratic circles.
The final scene in the farcical City of Melbourne
Bank enquiry was played last week, when assistant-
general-manager Robertson attended at the Insolvency

questions. Robertson, having admitted that certain of
the bank’s transactions seemed rather extraordinary,
Judge Molesworth remarked : “ Apparently the directors
knew nothing of what was going on, but I take it you
must have known.” To which Robertson replied that the
bad accounts were not discovered till after manager
Longmuir’s death. Then the examination closed with a
snap. Apparently the directors knew nothing, and the
only man who knew anything is safely stowed away in the
silent tomb.

The sale is reported of 50 tons of Great Cobar
copper at £6l 7s. Id. per ton. The high price, of course,

Last month’s crushing—s6o tons of stone for 396)0z. gold,
or 14dwt 3gr. per ton. All hands have been discharged
bv chairman Barton, who says that the low yield is simply
due to the fact that only poor stone instead of a fair
assortment was sent to the mill. He believes the rich
and poor sections of the reef can be so averaged as to go
anoz. to the ton, and he promises divs. within a few
weeks Yes, but for how many weeks will it last ? So
far it looks like a case of—poor mine, sack the manager.

Silver Hill Junction S.M. Co. is the latest
Barrier float. Capital moderate —£13,750 in 55,000 shares,
of which vendors take 20,000, besides £lBOO, which they
say they have paid for the properties. What they get the
20,000 shares for in that case is not very clear. The pro-
perties to be acquired were only recently pegged out:
the leases, in fact, are not yet granted. They are north-
east of the Junction, occupying a range of low hills
running parallel to the Broken Hill line and terminating
in the Round Hill. One of the claims used to be the
Silver Hill, before that Copper Blow ; the name Junction
is attached to it now, no doubt, because if the Broken
Hill lode didn’t twist back in the Junction it would enter
these claims. Junction manager Joel Phillips, by the
way, gave this corrtinuation-of-the-Junction-lode theory
(upon which some people were asked to go into the new
venture) a nasty knock when he reported : —“ This js one
of the best properties outside the Broken Hill line of
lode.” In the prospectus the whole statement is under-
lined —the public had better cnty underline the words in
italics here. Not that the claims haven’t got ore. They
have ; but the bodies are small and will be found patchy.
Junction North is now in a position to send out
well on to 1000 tons of ore a week. So far no big ore
contracts have been entered into, though Harrold Bros,
have taken 2600 tons of first-grade stuff; Block 14 is
taking some of the lower-grade ore. The body as it
stands in the mine looks very fine : if only there was
without doubt a long run of it, what a mine it would be 1
The coal-miners’ strike caused one or two B.H.
dressing mills to run short time, the North among the
number — an occurrence which looks not very creditable
to somebody or other.
Junction is going to sink a deep shaft far west
on its lease with the object of striking the underlay at
something like 1000 ft. Wonder if the Junction people
will have the courage to publicly announce the result.
The B.H. Proprietary people have invariably been “sealed
oysters ” where their deep exploratory works are con-
cerned.
B.H. South is going to have the “buck ’’which
was intended for the North, hut which failed. Two things
will be relied on —the increase in concentrate-production
(and the nearer prospect of divs. in consequence), and the
improvement in the lode at 800 ft. At this level the South
has, at time of writing, a big body—a very big body, in
fact—of hard, fine-grained ore, high in zinc and lead, but
very poor in silver. Even from the upper workings the
concentrates bulk only about 7oz. silver per ton, and 2f
tons of ore goes to the ton of concentrates. The works
put up a record in the second week in May—so 6 tons
(assaving 68'1 per cent, lead, 7 - 3 oz. silver, 7'B per cent,
zinc"' from 1379 tons ore. On account of poverty in silver,
combined with faulty high percentage of zinc, South con-
centrates are not snapped up as the products of the
other/mines are.
Shipments of B.H. sulphides to America have
begun.
The Central —Ashcroft’s process ; the Junction
—the Camden syndicate’s (John Howell’s); the British
the Burnham syndicate’s. The Camden syndicate has
pretty well a controlling interest in the Junction now, and
a good many Australian shareholders are beginning to
feel uneasy about it.
Observe the terms of the Burnham syndicate’s
compact with the British : it is “ for the lease of the
(British) company’s furnaces at Broken Hill and the sale
of ore and concentrates up to 100,000 tons annually.”
Furnaces will, it is expected, start within four months.
But the Health Dept, will see that they don’t start with-
out fume-saving appliances.

at’any other period of their history. Other big mines are

New Chum Railway, from its 2875 ft. reef, has

opened up. Some of the stopes are 14ft. wide and 10ft.
high for over 200 ft. in length. Co. has struck a deeper
reef, and, to get at it, will sink the shaft over 3000 ft.
Altogether, the Railway is proving a strong stimulant to
Bendigo’s deep-level digging.
Neighbor Shenandoah is not doing too well.
Railway reef, as it goes north, gets smaller, pinching to
4in. or sin., hence Shenandoahs are looking sickish in the
market. On the other hand, the reef is making strong to
the south, so the Eureka Extended has a good prospect of
getting it.
On the Hustlers line, the United Hustlers and
Redan still reigns the “ daddy” with 3oz. stone from the
900 ft. level. Hustlers’ reef has picked up somewhat, a
recent milling from a 6ft. reef below the 1200 ft. level
making the ounce. Hustlers No. 1, which many Sydney
people are backing, looks on the improve, but it has been
looking that way for the past six months without making

When J. Bull fully realises this little item, and finds out

properties under offer consist of the Perseverance P.C.,
which turned out a lot of gold a few years ago, the No. 1
East Perseverance, and the No. 2 East. The No. 1 East
has just cleared up 134 tons stone for 19dwts. 14grs. per

credit of £250, which is to be spent in sinking the shaft.

Hardly ever, even in N.S.W., has Parlia-
mentary procedure touched a lower level of
pitifulness than it did, the other night, upon the
1 arkes-family question. Ignominious closing of
the (Treat Parkesian Legend ! Half-a-century or
so of ministration to personal glorification and
the mighty interests of State,” with, at the end,
no more than a long list of destitute children and
an ignoble public discussion of the widow’s
domestic affairs that didn’t stop far short of the
dust-bin in the backyard or the slush-bucket under
the kitchen-table. But, all unconscious of the
abject squalor of the whole business, Copeland
asked, and Reid answered, and the House sat
waiting for the darning of the children’s socks and
the scrubbing of the front-door steps, and the
hoisting of the worn-out garments on the line, in
pathetic unconsciousness of the hugeness of the
satire upon itself as a convocation of alleged
legislators. The “dignity of Parliament” would
be a mighty joke, if it were not such a hideously
miserable lie !

Governor Brassey’s recent expatiation, in
the presence of his second wife, upon the virtues
of her predecessor, furnishes a striking exception to
the rule that it is hardly ever the twice-married
man who persists in obtruding Number One upon
the notice of Number Two. Is it a larger supply
of sentiment, or a blunter sense of the appropriate,

A Bulletin correspondent :
A condition of practical mutiny prevailed on H.M.S.
Orlando during that warship’s last cruise. In the
Service ’tis alleged that to her crew the Orlando
is “ a floating hell.” Of 2000 (about) “punishments” re-
corded against the men manning the Australian Squadron
during 12 months, 1200 (about) were for (alleged) offences
by Orlando men. But about the mutiny. It occurred
only a few weeks ago. To complete coaling within a
given time, all hands were ordered to work from 4 a.m.
till 11 p.m. The men loudly grumbled against this
slavery, but their protests were unavailing. Just on 8 p.m.
a brief “ spell-oh !” was granted, and the limb-tired coaleys
threw themselves down to rest—a rest so acceptable that
when the whistle was blown not a man rose. The mutiny
was absolute. Of course there was the devil to pay, the
upshot being a court-martial. The ringleaders were sen-
tenced to various terms of imprisonment, which they are
now serving. [Where? In Australian gaols?—Ed. B.]
Apropos, how many men have deserted from the Orlando
during the past four years ?

A Ballarat parson has been accusing Lord
Brassey of Sabbath desecration by throwing bis
yacht, the Sunbeam, open to visitors on that
blessed day. God, he says, will yet punish H.E.
by running the boat on to a rock. Secretly, The
Bulletin believes, the Sabbatarians are not at all
pleased with the “ Loard ” Himself for working
His sunbeams on the Day of Rust.

A Melb. daily has the pluck to sneer at
the evening-dress regulation of Brassey’s morning
levee. -No man is fit to bow to the Governor
unless he has a spike-tail coat, but the farthing-in-
the-pounders all have them. In the array of the -
presented are all the elite of the Insolvency Court.

Gov. Brassey’s objection to perform the
opening ceremony in connection with the new
operating-theatre at Melb. Hospital is easily ex-
plained. A few days before he was invited he
fell off his bicycle and cut his nose, and since then
the very thought of surgery has made him ill.
Another thing is that the performance of petty
functions palpably bores H.E. He finds that
Silken-Bond speeches are not wanted, but only
flabby compliments accompanied by a cheque, and
he is tired of that business.
Hobart Wes-

The other day a
woman was charged
at Sydney with hav-
ing no lawful means
of support. The pro-
secuting constable, in
response to a Bench
question, said she
was a woman of the
town and lived by
prostitution. The
magistrate thereupon
discharged her, re-
marking that prosti-
tution was no crime.
There seems no doubt
that the magistrate
Is correct in Ms state-
ment of the law. A
person making his
(or her) living by a
method not illegal
clearly has lawful
means of support.
Justice Foster once
upheld, on appeal,
the conviction of a
youth for not having
“lawful visible
means,” though it
was proved that he
existed by running a
street “ tote,” which
is not an offence at law. The general impression,
however, is that this decision will he overruled

Another travelled Australian :
George Ashton helped me to look for rooms in London
and we visited seven houses, not one of which had a bath-

found held the coal supply. The Englishman’s mornino’
tub would disgrace Kalgoorlie—and that’s all the bath he
takes, when he is taking any. Most London hotels charge

Among the multitude of begging letters
which find their way to a certain vice-regal post-

so at last bring back prosperity to our beloved
country.”

relying on the popular variety element incor-

day when a letter came from a lady :

To get the strength of this, a reply was sent ask-

A sample of toys landed in
Sydney from a late ’Frisco boat
consisted of miniature wooden

toy appears first as a grandly-
supercilious personage, with high
collar, ample white cuffs, and
abundance of heavy chains and
rings. The direction is ‘ ‘ Tap his

shoulder a rapid transformation
takes place. The toy wriggles and
turns itself inside-out, and instead
of the mightily-conceited indivi-
dual of a minute before there
stands before you a convict in

The Launceston Benevolent

that the ends justified the means
taken for turning them to a chari-

MY OATH!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A Sydney doctor recently refused to be sworn on a
police-court Bible. He stated that he had “ sanitary
reasons” for refusing.
The Bible seen in court, I ween,
Doth double duty bear :
The inside tells the way to hell,
The outside sends you there.
The Bible met in court should set
At rest polemic strife,
For it is plain it doth contain
The germ of after-life.
Have then a care ; if asked to swear,
Be something more than loth :
A general term for every germ
Is “My (police-court) oath.”

That beautiful machine, the Yost type-

its great value. In less than four years it has
been awarded ten gold medals ; among the type-
writers ordered by the London School Board for
instruction purposes, the Yost’s total exceeded the
combined aggregate of all other machines taken
by one third. The Yost has been adopted by the
English, French, and Colonial Govts. The
Sydney Lands Dept., the Electrical Dept., the
Public Library, Norton and Smith, Gordon and
Gotch, &c., &c., have recently adopted them.
The working of the Yost can be learned in ten
minutes, and one hour’s practice a day will enable
anyone to write as fast as with a pen. After that
the rate quickly increases with practice. The
Yost has no ribbon ; prints direct on the paper.

In deciding to prosecute Rapiport and
Baxter, the cronk Melb. magistrates, Attornev-
Geperal Isaacs has simply given this precious pair
an opportunity of rehabilitating themselves and
coming out with expanded chests to pose as
martyrs. Doubtless the notorious beaks justified
the Lormer Board’s decision, but no one with any
knowledge of law, or of tribunals of justice, for
a moment thinks the evidence adduced before
the Board of Enquiry sufficient to gain a convic-
tion. The prosecution is to take place upon a case
in which the principal and, in fact, only material
witness, is a woman who wobblesomely alleges
that while a hotel licensee she bribed the accused
to adjudicate in her favor. As there is no direct
corroboration a conviction is utterly unlikely,
especially in view of the manner in which the
witness has backed and filled.

Dear Bulletin, — You quote the remark
of a Sydney lady-medico—“ Our friends behave
badly when they found our claims to practice on
the demerits of medical men ” —as though there
wbre good grounds for it. But who has accused
the male practitioners of any more demerit than
naturally attaches to their sex in treating female
patients? We friends of the doctoress merely
contend that she is qualified to cure one-half of
humanity, whilst the doctor is the fitting person
to practise on the other half. In his proper
sphere the medical man has no demerits nor is
the assertion that he ought not to undertake the
medical woman’s duties any slur upon his charac-
ter. If it were the fair sex that had monopolised
the profession of physic we would ‘ ‘ barrack ” for
the introduction of doctors, even as now we sing
praises to the doctoress. Your Sydney lady-
medico is, I imagine, putting in a word for her
husband, present or future. She has married a
medical man, or hopes to, and would have it under-
stood that he is quite as meritorious a person as
herself. So he is. Hitherto he has been a bad
thing for sooiety, but the lady, under the same
circumstances, would have been no less unsatisfac-
tory.— E.E:

a month? A.: No. Q. :
What if I could prove that
one well-to-do civil servant
pays .£1 a month for his
father? A. (after much
beating-about): Well, if he
gives it only as a dona-
tion. ... ! Q. : Say
two old people are put up
for a vacancy —one of them
has a relation who will give
=£l a month as a donation,
and the other has no
friends—how then ? A.
(after a long pause): Well,
I would report favorably
on behalf of the one that
could, pay, for I get my
commission out of it. Q. :
And what about the other
two unfortunates—they go
to gaol, I suppose ? A. :
Well, yes. Q. : What if,
after paying, say, for six
months, the relations
stopped payment ? A. :
Well, you see, that is awk-
ward ; we can’t turn the
old people out if they be-
ll ave themselves. Q. :
What does it cost to keep
an inmate? A. : Four
shillings per week. Q. :
Do you think this dona-
tion system is fair? A. :
Well, no ; but all the in-
stitutions are the same.
The paying people get the
preference. Q. : And the
others go to gaol ? A. :
That’s so.— Subscriber.

or becomes violent and goes

to the game;
but, except
at panic
times, there
isn’t much
competi-
tion. The
most deep-
rooted man-
iac of the
crowd is the
brother of a
now - forgot-
ten Q. poli-
tician. Eight
or ten years
ago he be-
came con-
vinced that
the N.S.W.
Govt, owed
him .£50,000,
and for months
he drifted into all
sorts of public
offices, and tried to
collect his money
from the Superinten-
dent of Explosives, or
the Chief-Justice, or the
Valuer under the Real Pro-
perty Act, with equal hope-
fulness and vim. At last a
venerable messenger, who repre-
sented himself as the Colonial
Treasurer and principal engine-driver
to the Neglected Children’s Department,
explained to him that the money had
been paid to his credit at a certain Sydney
bank and for about seven years he has called
there for it persistently. Sometimes he calls
three times in a week; at other times, once
in six weeks satisfies him. In wet weather he gener-
ally insinuates a dripping gamp into the ledger-
keeper’s department to draw that officer’s attention,
and hands up his cheque to be initialled ; or else
he runs after the general manager, if he happens
to be about, and tries to catch him with the crook
of the umbrella and explain things to him. The
result is mostly an entry in the petty cash, “ Gra-
tuity to lunatic, 3d.,” or something to that effect.
On two occasions he has managed to look sane
enough to persuade speculative lawyers to serve
writs on the institution, and once he filled in a
deposit-slip and handed it in along with a large
chunk of mud which he wanted to put to his credit
immediately.
On one blissful occasion he vanished for fom
months, and it transpired that the Queensland
politician had shipped his eccentric relative to
England. Then one day a cipher cable arrived
from the London office : “ Blank and Co., solici-
tors, suing behalf J. Thingumbob, =£50,000. Cable
instructions. ” It was the well-remembered lunatic
again, and it took a lot of expensive cablegrams to
settle the trouble. It was settled at last, however,
and then, three months later, just when the local
office was settling down to its accustomed calm, a
familiar moist umbrella appeared over the parti-
tion of the ledger-keeper’s department, and the
familiar cheque for =£50,000 was handed up to be
initialled once more. The office lunatic had come
back. Then the messenger, with great presence of
mind, rushed him into a cab, told him that a
beautiful female of immense wealth was waiting at
the Coffee Palace to marry him, and sent him off
at a gallop. There was a considerable row at a
number of coffee palaces that day through a
strange man trying to hustle the nearest waitress
into a cab and take her to the registrar there and
then, but fortunately no one was killed

The other Saturday afternoon, prior to the
theatrical carnival, a few hot and agitated females
were observed to haunt a particular spot in the
main hall of Melb. Exhibition building. Bicycle
races were happening in the quadrangle outside,
and the haunted spot proved to be the riders’
dressing-room, or reserve, closed in with a large
strip of matting. A hole in this fragile partition
accounted for the feminine excitement. A peep
through the aperture revealed an array of naked
bikists, woefully thin and nubbly creatures in all
cases, but men, nevertheless. The peepers seemed
to take it in turns to satisfy themselves re the sex
question, and the effect of a prolonged enquiry
on their delicate organisations was thrilling to
witness. One damsel needed assisting away from
the spectacle, she was so overcome by shame, or
something. Besides, the other ladies were wait-
ing.

At Sydney Central last week, after a
woman charged with stealing a purse from a
customer at Mark Eoy’s had given evidence, the
arresting constable put several questions to her,
“ What was she doing in Mark Eoy’s?” She re-
plied that she was buying some goods. “ What
did the goods consist of ? ” They consisted of two
bottles of medicine and some hosiery. Then, in
stern, solemn tones and with his fat forefinger
lifted in menace, constable McQuacker uttered
these memorable words: “Will you swear that
you didn’t tell me yesterday that it was medicine
and stockings you bought?”
. . . . Love me,
If one day only ; let thy sweet, red lips,
Redder than dew-moist red pomegranate buds,
■Drp'p gently on my brow with soft flower-touch.
Clasp me fast circled with your foam-white arms,
Dropp thy small head till all thy sun-bright hair
Floats cloudwise o’er my face.
Speak in love murmurs ; let thy stream-like voice
With tuneful ripplings flow about my heart,
And lqll me with the dream that thou art true ;
Then stab or leave—if it seem good to thee—
But one hour of thy false and most sweet love
w ere. worth the truest heart that ever brake for
man.

Sydney, May 26, 1896.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
The Hampden regime is breaking the Australian
record for fervid patronage of all sorts and condi-
tions of charities, beginning with lost dogs—
in dogs Her Excellency delights. And Gov.
Hampden’s natural gift of airily cheapening
everything his audience secretly but resentfully
worships makes a “ somewhat different ” vice-
regality of him. His artistic method of touching
on the tender subject of the aristocracy in a land
now politically run by the cocky Premier who
threatened to supply his own Gov. if the Authori-
ties didn’t look sharp about it, amounts to inspira-
tion. Gov. H.’s latest irreverent reference to his
own class occurred in his speech at the City
Mission meeting, when he averred that hereditary
peers and paupers, felons and lunatics had equal
voting power. To my mind His Ex.’s cavalier,
quizzical way of sizing up the nobility, is likely to
be resented by a Lord-fearing Society which daily
prays for grace to be able to take the Royal family
seriously, and doesn’t want any undermining in-
fluences within the camp. And His Ex. ’s oratory
also suggests that the utterances of the Talking
Classes at ’Ome is shaping itself more to suit
Agnes Ebbsmith than the Duke.
The perfervid manner m which Gov. Hampden
shoves along his spoke of the wheel of Charity
rather makes society hump its back. Governors
are not expected to push any show as if they had
shares in it. A smile, a donation, a graceful pose,
and a few ambiguous remarks are their part of the
bill, but Gov. H. rubs it in so that you expect to
see him get off the platform and go round with
the hat. At the aforesaid City Mission show,
H.E.’s enthusiastic appeal to Society to put its
hand in its pocket (if it can find it) took a lot of
people the wrong way. Women who go about
seeking the shy subscription for the in-every-way-
deserving City Mission, tell of the philanthropist
who so objects to having his right hand know
what his left is up to, that he always refuses to
put his name on their lists, and prefers to give his
charity indiscriminately—which is not at all.
According to Gov. H. (who talks too fluently on
all subjects to be very earnest in many of them),
“ indiscriminate alms-giving is a reprehensible in-
dulgence,” so anybody who aspires to Fashion is
herewith solemnly informed that it is not Guv-
mentouse form to relieve anybody except per
medium of a subscription-list which gets published
and lets everybody know how many sins the
charity of the upper ten is likely to cover.
Speaking for myself, I detest the cold, fashion-
able doctrine (preached also by no less a personage
than Primate Smith) of “ I never give money in
the street.” It is very English and most anti-
Australian, for, thank goodness, much of the
kindly, hospitable spirit of the Bush and the Old
Times still lingers in the breasts of dwellers in the
city, where men and women are so much more
wrapped up in their own affairs, and are so much
more familiar with the sight of absolute destitu-
tion than those who dwell under miner’s canvas or
in bush huts. I even go so far as to reverence the
simple superstition of the circus-man who told me
the other day that he never refused money to a
beggar. He dared not —it was unlucky, he said ;
and that man carries his belief to the extent of
walking far out of his way to get change, rather
than allow any man who asks him for a meal to go
unfed. To my mind, the sawdust man’s creed
that it is unlucky not to feed the hungry when
and where they ask for food forms one of the chief
elements of true religion.
The Hampdens paid a visit to Sydney Hospital
the other day. After inspecting the majority of
the non-catching patients, “ to each of whom Lady
Hampden addressed a friendly word ” (after all,
vice-regal amiability iB too catholic to be comfort-
ing—where is the social distinction of the thing
when everybody has the right to refer to “wot
Lady ’Ampden sez to me ” ?) and doing the dismal,
over-clean halls of suffering from kitchen to coffin,
the V.R. party left (so say the papers) “express-
ing pleasure at what they had seen.” Yet nobody
but a doctor or a morbid soul finds any real plea-
sure in the disinfectant-haunted atmosphere of a
hospital which sends most visitors away feeling
that Sudden Death has ’em by the baok hair.
Sydney University Society presented a serious
play in five acts at Sydney Gaiety Theatre last
Thursday, entitled “Fanchon the Cricket.” De-
spite clever Frau Buhrow’s sprightly and finished
acting in the title-rdle, Miss Marks’s excellent ren-
dering of the witch, Mr. Gregan M‘Mahon’s
wonderful make-up as the stern parent, and Mr.
A. B. Davies’s shapely grey legs as Landre, who
had that most awkward of amateur roles —the
amateur lover, who hasn’t the lady’s mamma’s or
husband’s permission to hug her in front of all these
people and has to struggle with his unconvincing
love as if the girl were standing within a rabbit-
proof fence—despite all these bright spots in a
tedious narrative, “Fanchon” was a frost.
It was five acts long ! The “ unflaggingness ”of
the star became too apparent, and even her partial
disrobement on the stage and the fact that the
morris-dancers, told not to wear their frocks too
long, erred decidedly in the opposite direction,
were of no avail; in “ Fanchon ” “ the duds ” get
bowled for a goose-egg for once in a way. Domes-
tic drama is not suited to amateurdom, since it is
written that whenever an amateur wants to make
you laugh you weep. The ’teur who departs from
light comedy or farce is, therefore, lost. A weird
feature of “ Fanchon ” was that people wore the
same clothes for five acts, with an interval, too,
where one year passed away and took its time
about it, judging by the way one felt. Nobody
changed frocks but the star, who made several
effective changes and must have been pleased to
see how clean her lover had kept his best jerkin
after breaking his heart in it for twelve months.
“Fanchon’’drew a fair-sized house headedbytwo
Y.R. damsels, the eldest in white silk “bent ” (as
we say in heraldry) with pink and blue, and her
sister in cream chine. The last Gov. to go to a
U.D.S. show was poor ex-Gov. Duff, and he, so
far as I can make out, cost the society two-pun-ten
and survived the ordeal 18 months. By the way,
the Hampdens are rare patronisers—the largeness
of their family circle enables them to shed a V.R.
halo over a number of engagements at once. Of
course, it is only a subdued sort of halo when the
girls head the procession, but I confess I like it
when there’s a V.R. damsel in the lead. She is very
punctual, in most cases, and there is, as a rule, no
“God Save.” The raciest feature of the show
was after the morris-dance, when the dancers
flocked into a stage-box in their ballet dresses,
floral-wreaths, and paint, against a background of
under-graduates in boiled shirts. One damsel was
using her opera-glass so that it looked like a
domino, and the whole scene was really Frenchy.
After the performance the company received a
good many of its friends on the stage.
The ball given by Commodore Hordern to
the members of the Prince Alfred Yacht Club and
their friends, at Paddington Town Hall last
Friday, was a distinct success. The hall was im-
posingly decorated with huge floral anchors, stars,
palms and ropes of greenery, and a fleet of model-
yachts apparently held a regatta on the platform.
Music and floor were excellent, and people who
“ dance the Minuetta but like the supper better,”
as they used to say in “Djin-Djin, must have
had a good time, seeing that the supper-room was
practically open all the evening. The huge crowd
of guests were received at the top of the staircase
by Mrs. Hordern in a pearly-color brocade with
lappels embroidered in gold sequins; one or two
crimson roses and a dazzling array of diamonds
making an effective finish to the handsomest dress
in the room. Mrs. H. Daniels (wife of the Town-
Clerk) wore an artistic dress of white silk pat-
terned with mauve irises, a berthe of white chiffon
with small bows of purple velvet, diamond orna-
ments. Mrs. John See was in pink brocade and
a deep cream lace collar ; Miss Dolly Hordern in
a debutante frock of white silk and valley lilies.
A novel feature of the ball was the number of
juveniles. Ever since the Governor’s youngest son
was seen whirling in an Eton suit at a Guvment-
ouse hop, the best-regulated nurseries have refused,
on the grounds of obsoleteness and bad form, to go
to bed at seven when their parents were giving a
ball.
If the craze for fitting Little Billee into an Eton
suit and starting him off on the beeswax continues
to spread, the dancing-man may find himself out
in the cold. I hear that at a suburban spinsters’
dance the other evening, the number of small
schoolboys successfully finding places on all pro-
grammes made many a grown-up youth do the
wall-flower act. The only reason that I can see
for this toleration of the unfinished is that the
dear girls are getting their hand (or should it be
foot?) in so as to be able to dance with foreign
naval-officers, who are usually little Johnnies who
look as if they had been grown under pots. At
the aforesaid spinsters’ dance, I am told, several of
the unplucked rosebuds were carrying on quite
h, la Clontarf, whistling, shouting, whirling till
they flopped, and generally making hay of the con-
ventionalities. And yet they wonder, I suppose,
why they are still spinsters.
The Fresh Air League ball, on the 3rd prox., is
going to be a great success, if the sale of tickets is
any criterion. The object of the “ Fal ” ball is to
prevent suffering by giving change and rest to
weary work-girls, so everybody cordially hopes the
Centennial Hall will not be large enough for the
attendance next Wednesday evening. On June
30th the ever-popular Tempe ball (the “men’s
ball,” though I really don’t know why) occurs in
the Town Hall; and on June 24th, the Randwick
dance, in aid of the R.C. Church, takes place in Pad-
dington Town Hall; while the French ball (where
nothing ever happens like the dancing in
“ Trilby”) will be held at the same place on the
15th prox. Two private dances, that look well on
paper, and may run into an inside-place, are the
Neutral Bay Tennis Club hop, at Need’s rooms, on
the sth June; and the Centennial Tennis Club
bread-and-butter dance, at Paddington Town Hall,
on the 25th. But I would like to rise and solemnly
ask the committees of the last two if they have got
an aide-de-camp to throw the light of his profile
on the proceedings ? If they have not, they are
lost, for we have it on the authority of a Sydney
Society scribess that, without one of these
“ coveted prizes,” no entertainment can hope to be
taken seriously.
The most depressing thing about the Sydney
Turf Club races on 25th inst. was the forlorn way
in which feminine society promenaded unescorted.
Even the vice-regal girls tailed off down the lawn
with two girl-pals who rescued them from lonely
grandeur in the midst of the Governor’s box. I
don’t think the “coveted prizes” quite acted as sich
at the races. Capt. Stanley, in a pink shirt-front,
did the most of the squiring—but I suppose even
prize aides-de-camp cannot accomplish the impos-
Bible. To provide a Jack for every Jill in the
Guvmentouse-party would be indeed a big order.
I don’t wonder that at least two very pretty
Society girls were left to promenade the grass in
one another’s society. Their attentions to the
navy are so marked and exclusive that when the
Fleet is cruelly ordered away to the nearest polo-
match it is only natural that civilians with many
dance-refusals rankling in their souls should seize
the occasion to return a Roland for an Oliver.
Gov. and Lady Hampden turned up (late) for
about five minutes at the races (the birthday of
their Sovereign means a lot of wear and tear to
her representatives). Her Ex. looked very well in
purple with a small waist, a couple of pink roses
in her bonnet supplying the inevitable violent
contrast; while His Ex. in a glossy top hat (he
has abandoned straw hats to the races) and pencil
umbrella (and other things, of course) was a soul-
stirring spectacle. One V.R. damsel wore a helio-
trope dress verging on the smart; another was in
brown with cream satin collars Puritan" shape-
just like a glorified edition of the frock the vir-
tuous heroine goes to work in while hubby is in
gaol in Bland Holt’s plays; and a third sported
ultramarine-blue cloth with reefer coat and black
velvet hat with black plumes and satin ribbon.
By the way, one hat in the V.R. party was in-
teresting—it had a plateful of fiery roses plastered
all over the lady’s back hair, as if her occiput was
a verandah-pole.
Dot Boucicault did the lawn with a smartly-
dressed society matron in biscuit, with biscuit-net
over the sleeves and edgings of brown fur, white
felt toque trimmed with violets; a,nd another
taking gown was a Parisian-made toilet of black
satin, fine anchovy-red cloth, and black jet, worn
by a legal man’s wife. The most peculiar turn-out
looked like something between Mrs. John Bull
and a costermonger. It was dark-blue with little
brass buttons in threes down the front, and the
hat was the exact shape J. Bull wears in the pier
tures. A tourist female turned up in a grey check
suit with a grey felt hat, man’s shape, skewered
on, however, with very feminine bonnet-pins ; and
I can’t say I liked the look of a girl with a turn-
back over her shoulders of crimson velvet edged
with fur—it looked too like the historical sheep-
skin garment of Bryan O’Lynn. The races, by
the way, were postponed from Saturday to Mon-
day, which may account for the stale look of most
of the frocks, and certainly explains the toughness
of the hind-legs of the poultry in the members'
luncheon-room.
The committee of St. Vincent’s Hospital ball
are crowing over their grand total, £441 4s.—the
second largest amount the ball has ever netted.
It is rather disheartening that the day (Saturday)
when the Village Fair at Sydney Exhibition (held
by the W.C.T.U. and the Y.M.C.A., and all the
other initials that signify cold tea, and opened by
Lady Hampden) trusted to make the biggest haul
in aid of the Cawse was (irony of appropriateness !)
the wateriest rainy day of the season. A thing
like that is like drowning a cat in cream, and
makes the godly seriously critical of the ways of
Providence, which ought to know better than to
send down the prohibitionists’ favorite liquor at
the wrong moment and spoil the sale of the ginger-
beer. It really looks as if Providence and Prohi-
bition weren’t quite so chummy as the latter tries
to make out.
A more or less recently-unpacked Australasian
Gov. (not N.S.W.’s) sets an example of thrift in
high places that fairly entitles him to the belt as
champion skinflint. A recent exploit of his was
to march into a leading ironmonger’s and ask to
see some filters ; having chosen one, he wanted to
know if he could procure it at Home price ? The
salesman apologetically hinted that freight, duty,
and profit precluded the possibility, upon which
H.E. calmly remarked, “very well; if you hear
of anybody having a good second-hand one to sell,
please send him to Govt. House.” Should this
sort of thing continue, the suspicion will gain
ground that Her Ex.’s millinery is procured
through the medium of London women-journals
in which “ lady shortly expecting to go into mourn-
ing will exchange Gaiety - girl’s turn-out for a
second-hand or misfit coffin.”
But society really cannot afford to look pained at
tales of V.R. economy. The self-made Society
person who has shaken hands, as it were, with every
£ in his banking-account is also careful to the
verge of eccentricity with his worldly wealth. For
example, the subscription-lists for the terrible
Brunner mine disaster, opened in Brisbane, showed
a total of £5O after three weeks’ begging, although
Maoriland generously poured in thousands when
the same city was in trouble over the floods of ’93.
Meanness is one of the good old Hinglish attri-
butes of the “ best ” people everywhere in Anglo-
Saxondom, and any Govt. House which thinks it
can give anybody a lesson in cheeseparing, or how
to skin a flea for its hide, is merely wasting its
time.
The friends of a red-headed and popular actress
at present on the sick-list, were encouraged to
believe, the other day, that all might yet be well
when the prepossessing invalid rose and demanded
a bottle of hair-lotion with which to anoint her
tresses. A most promising sign. The woman who
sends out for cosmetics is as good as convalescent.
By the way, what a lot of Titian-red hair there
is knocking about just now—ready for the fur
season, I suppose. “ Shall I tell you a secret ? All
women look well in fur,” says a lady in “Re-
bellious Susan,” but it is only partially true,
after all, for bright hair is a sine qua non. All
this red hair looks so picturesque that it’s almost a
pity Condy’s fluid is responsible for the bulk of it,
though it certainly looks more ingenious than
gold-wash, and one perceives in it an admirable
dodge for the red-headed man going grey to dye
his hair red. Nobody would ever suspect the
trick, which is one of the distinctest advantages
of being red headed.
I hear that a gilt-edged young Sydney lady,
who recently went to England accompanied
by a lady friend, to fulfil a matrimonial-engage-
ment, is returning to Australia, still unwed but
engaged to someone else—her travelling companion
having supplanted her in the effections of the man
she went ‘ ‘ home ” to marry.
Writes my Melb. correspondent:—
“ A quiet Melb. divorce-suit, that happened a
while ago, might have been mentioned at the time
as a warning to sympathetic couples. Mrs. Blank
was a rather aggressively proper person up to the
age of thirty, when, with her husband's approval,
she appeared in the role of “ court companion ” to
a lady respondent. The case in question lasted
many days, and its giddy details probably under-
mined the stern propriety of the matron who had
come along to keep her unfortunate friend in
countenance. Mrs. Blank slowly renounced the
authority of Mrs. Grundy and became an altered
woman. Finally she figured once more in the
court, this time with a friend to keep her in
countenance, and the decree nisi which had
formerly moved her to weep for another woman
now set the tears flowing for herself. The story
sounds like an argument in favor of ordering
females to leave the court when spicy evidence
falls due. Are the Social Purity Society ladies
listening ?
“ Miss Daisy Madden, the Chief Justice’s pretty
daughter, has returned from Europe with her own
special specimen of the fine family voice beautified
and strengthened by her course of lessons under
Marchesi. Miss Madden was a great favorite
with ‘ Madame,’ who has declared to others that
if the pretty Australian girl could take to the
stage, she would make a great reputation. The
Madden girls are all clever as well as pretty, and
their admiration for their much -moustached father
is only equalled by their affection for their still
beautiful mother.
“ Gov. Brassey is seriously engaged with a
Home Reading Union which holds its meetings at
Govt. House. Brassey’s speeches, Queen Vic’s
‘ Life in the Highlands,’ the Life of the Prince
Consort, and similar treasures are likely to be the
standard classics of the Union. People sniff
scornfully at the Brassey efforts to improve them,
‘ Shall you join the Govt. House reading circle?’
one of the Toorak women was asked. ‘ Well ’
(dubiously) ‘do they have refreshments after?’’
Refreshments are regarded as doubtful, and
society doesn’t bite at the off chance.
“ After the frolicsome and terpsichorean Hope-
toun, the ponderous Brassey is a fearful dead-
weight on all festive occasions. The women en-
deavor, to the utmost of their power, to persuade
him to give his dignity a holiday, but, so far, their
efforts have been a failure, and his early departure
is fervently prayed for. There is but one way
open to the clumsy millionaire to make himself
popular, and that is to respond to the request—
‘ Will Lord Brassey please oblige us with a skirt-
dance ? ’
The N.S.W. duty on cement comes off on
30th June, and the local cement-industry has been
killed. Goodlet and Smith’s cement-works were
closed last week and 100 men discharged.
Reid and Tozer, while each professing to
give the fullest credence to the other fellow’s yarn
about the Broken Hill trip, are both careful to
point out that the home-manufactured narrative is
much the more probable. In a contest of evidence,
however, Premier Reid, who admits that he is
occasionally a bit of a liar himself, has no chance
with Col.-Sec. Tozer, whose veracity is a house-
hold word in Kanakaland—so much so that he is
affectionately called “Truthful Tozer” by the
press, while in the backblocks the expression,
“You’re a Tozer ! ” is familiarly applied only to
local G. Washingtons. Besides, Tozer had a
letter to prove his story. Reid rather thinks the
proof wasn’t in the letter —which, of course, Tozer,
a most careless chap with written documents, des-
troyed right away. On the whole, the matter re-
mains in suspense, and the problems whether
Reid really did ask Tozer to come to Broken Hill;
why the N.S.W. Labor-members played two-
up with Tozer on the train, and merely funked
him before their constituents; and why they don’t
all wear tan boots like Griffiths, and live up to
them, must be handed down for posterity to
puzzle over.
N.S. Wales has bled scandalously over the
Dean Commission. F. W. Cumow (son of editor
Curnow, of S.M. Herald) was paid =£4l4 Is. for
acting as secretary and taking notes at the 39
sittings of the Dean Commission, or .£lO 12s. 4d.
per sitting (averaging, say, three hours in dura-
tion). Apparently he did not even transcribe his
notes for this, for transcription and typewriting
are charged extra ! T. D. Elwell, another ex-
Hekald reporter, who died in the course of the
sittings, received .£3lO for notes and transcription;
G. Elwell, who looks like a little brother Bill, drew
£22 for typewriting; C. F. Jones, another short-
hand writer, was paid =£244 for notes and tran-
scription (he seemingly did deceased Elwell’s work
just as well at half the screw); E. S. Garran (re-
lated to the ex-editor of S.M. Herald ?) got £l7 for
typewriting; and another £3O was divided among
miscellaneous typewriters. In addition, Mr. Cur-
now was paid £315 for making a precis of evidence,
so that his total cheque was £729 for work apparently
done between May 13, when the Commission first sat,
and June 28, when its report was presented— six
weeks work ! The total paid for clerical labor
was £1358 ; the lawyers and commissioners drew
£l5BO ; miscellaneous expenses, including printing,
were £491; and the abortive trial of Crick,
Meagher and the others for conspiracy cost £1123
—barrister Heydon drawing £715. The total cost
of Commission and conspiracy trial was £4553.
John Davies, the once-celebrated Sydney
political underground-engineer, died last week,
and thus follows his old master, Parkes, into
Shadowland at a respectful distance. Mr. Davies
began life as a blacksmith, dabbled in ward politics,
and developed into an all-powerful Parliamentary
organiser. He was smooth and sleek and oily and
black-coated, and travelled on the teetotal-and-
Orange racket. After having for years steadily
increased in power as Parkes’s Toby— or was
Parkes his Toby ?—he fell into ill odor over
some two or three little aldermanic and otnea-
matters and had to take refuge in the legis-
lative Council, where, though he was at nrs
almost boycotted, he ultimately became rattier
popular ; for he never forgot a favor or a face or a
promise, nor did he ever pass an old friend, now
ever shabby, in the street. John Davies was a
calculating man of strong common-sense, im l*?F'
turbable temper, and sphinx-like visage. In P u ° u
he spoke more to the point than lluan y bet
educated politicians, and he ever carefully dresse
his part ” according to nonconformist notions
Respectability—wherein lay no small portion o
his success. He was but 57 when he died—tr
the effects of an unaccountable complication
diseases.

Every man nowadays insists on getting a
full sovereign’s worth for each sovereign, and the
true business man’s policy is to meet every man
on that basis. No man in Australia acts more
stedfastly on this principle than does Mr. R. 0.
Hagon, the energetic merchant tailor of 129 King-
street, Sydney, and his establishment is, there-
fore, deservedly to the front in public esteem. The
new winter goods make a very fine display, and
while town patrons are invited to call and choose
for themselves, country ones are requested to drop
a line at once for patterns and self measurement
forms. The specially shrunken tweeds are a
feature which appeals to every man who thinks,
and all old cutomers can recommend prospective
new ones to invest their money in one of R. 0.
Hagon s suits. The establishment now employs
150 hands, and the chief cutter is the highest
salaried cutter in Sydney.*
The Rabbit Pest and How to Grapple with
It.— ln dealing with this question the ingenuity
of thousands of our colonists has been exerted to
find some means of stamping out the rabbit
plague. Fencing, trapping, poisoning, all have
been employed to arrest the increase of this pest,
but unfortunately the plague still makes progress,
and is surely extending through Queensland in
spite of all efforts to arrest its advance. The
people realise the enormous annual outlay of land-
owners in checking the increase of rabbits. The
sum spent every year exceeds £900,000. New
Zealand is the only colony, so far, that has
thoroughly reduced the plague ; the new poison,
“ Toxa, is the agent through which bunny is
destroyed by the million, and the New Zealander,
through it, has practically made rabbit-destruction
a paying business. The action of the poison is
instantaneous ; once a rabbit touches it he rarely
runs twenty yards, and all the skins are secured,
which more than defray the labor and cost of the
poison. It has been estimated that eight full-
grown rabbits will consume as much grass as a
full-grown shSep. The National Wool Company
introduced the poison to Australia, and where
tried it has given excellent results.*

In Australian cities and towns
no name calls up more agreeable
reminiscences than that of the Rev.
Chas. Clark, the King of Lecturers.
Clark was the pioneer of Smythe’s
Australian lecturing legion ; and he is
the best as well as the first. He is
now making his fourth Australian
tour; no other “celebrity” has ven-
tured on a second ; so Clark proves
again the theory of the survival of the
fittest. Hard work agrees with him.
Twenty-five years have passed since
his first appearance on the Melbourne
platform, where he lectured on be-
half of his church ; but age has
no more withered him than it
withers good wine. Clark was
trained as a Baptist minister, and
he is a Baptist minister still. Proba-
bly he thinks one denomination as
good as another ; for he preaches
from many_ pulpits, and has been
called the Universal Chaplain. Opi-
nions vary as to whether Clark ap-
pears at his best as a preacher or as a
lecturer. Some people prefer him in
the pulpit; for years after he arrived
in Melbourne you could not get into
his church, yet only last week it was
impossible to get into Melb. Town
Hall to hear him lecture. He must
have made a good deal of money ; but
he is ever ready to raise his voice in
the cause of charity. None who
gained admission will forget the sight
when, in Aug., 1890, he preached in
the Sydney Town Hall on behalf of
the city hospitals ; and there was a
similar scene in the Melb. Town Hall
last Sunday, when he preached in aid
of another charitable fund.
Hori Grey has been forbidden by his doctor
to pay his contemplated visit to Maoriland.
Parkes left his letters and papers in the
hands of B. R. Wise for possible publication.
Bevill is the N.S.W. grog-sellers’ secretary,
and Clark is the Great Panjandrum of the Cold
Tea crowd. A whisky-and-soda is now locally
known as “ a Bevill and Clark.”
Dr. Cullen, rival candidate with Speaker
Abbott for the vacant seat in the Senate of Sydney
University, was drafter of the Federation Bill
once fathered by Barton and Parkes.
Mr. Hugh Watt, lately accused by Premier
Kingston of having tried to bribe him in connec-
tion with a Northern Territory land-concession,
has been divorced at the instance of his wife.
Charles Wilson, brother to Salmon, died
at Cheltenham at Easter, aged 79 years. His
daughter was married, some two years ago, to Sir
George Baden Powell, who has since been living
in clover.
An aged Indian officer, with a brother in
the Scots Greys, is pushing a wheelbarrow round
Australia. So far, he has done 4000 miles, travel-
ling Q., N.S.W. and Vic., his only companion a
sheep-dog.
Many Sydney people will be glad to learn
that an erstwhile prominent bank-manager, whose
Australian career ended in disaster, has, in another
part of the world, by lucky speculations, made an
immense fortune.
S.M. Herald allows its leader-writer to
refer to a fatty Napoleonic simulacrum as “ Plon
Plon,”but would denounce as a scurrilous person-
ality an allusion to another fatty personage under
the nickname of “Tummy.”
De Rose, Brookman’s mate in the Boulder
finding, is reputed to grip over half-a-million
British boodle in return for a slice of his W. A.
gold interests. He is booked as an addition to
S.A.’s group of millionaires.
Mr. Justice Simpson’s scheme of etiquette
covers matters far beyond the legal bar. He once
to’d a (now derelict) attorney that he should not
drink in public-houses : “Always wait till you get
to your club,” said his Honor.
It was statistically stated some years ago
that N.S.W. possessed 80 inhabitants, each with
an income of £lO,OOO and upwards a year. It is
said that the current income-tax returns reveal less
than 30 of these happy people.
Another Queen’s Birthday has passed, and
Premiers Reid (N.S.W.), Turner (Vic.), and
Kingston (S.A.), are still out of the political
lazaret, i.e., they are all still Plain Bill. If this is
by their own choice, The Bulletin doubly con-
gratulates them.
John Robb, late of the Federal Bank clan*
was struck down by apoplexy whilst chatting and
laughing with Muntz, of the Mercantile crowd.
Ho v these busted-bank directors love one another!
One feels curious as to what Robb and Muntz
were laughing about.
Another old Sydney identity, Mr. P. F.
Morgan, has died in London, aged 76 years. Mr.
Morgan was formerly in business as a chemist in
Sydney, and realised a handsome fortune. His
end was much hastened by worry arising out of
bank-reconstructions.
Dan Sapoo, a Cingalee, paralysed Justice
Cooper, the other day up North, by responding to
the question “ Are you a Christian ? ” “ No, I’m
a Wesleyan.” Cooper didn’t even smile, but cer-
tain of the saintly Rutledge’s enemies assert that
he went out and wept bitterly.
Superintendent Read is regarded by many
as the “natural” successor to N.S.W. Police
Inspector-General Fosbery, when that officer
chooses to retire. In this connection it is gravely
urged that the superintendent is a devoutly re-
ligious man who, in addition to fixedly maintain-
ing statute law, never misses an opportunity to
impress on policeman and prisoner alike that there
is a moral law higher than all. This characteristic
alone should win the billet from a “ God-fearing
Government.”
The death of Patrick Buckley has evoked
the statement that County Cork (Ireland) has
conferred perhaps more prominent men on Aus-
tralasia than has any other country or similar
division of territory in the United Kingdom. The
statement may be true. Besides Buckley, the
names of Martin, Madden and Stawell at once
rise to mind.

The Australian language as she are spoked
at Norfolk Island. Item from a letter to Sydney
Telegraph, signed “ Byron Adams, Chief Magis-
trate ”: —
I regret to state the difference I find in the people on
my return, resulting from the various conversations and
meetings which he held during his visit of two weeks,
listening to reports of the lowest character possible, and
using it as a malign to the people. After learning the
different remarks he made in his public meeting, and will
not allow any gentleman to defend the people, raise me to
a vigorous state of mind and great surprise.

Poet J. Brunton Stephens has a sonnet
in the Queenslander which is a virtual reproach
against the Bananalanders for their apathy in
the matter of the Brunner catastrophe - fund.
Maoriland subscribed for the Q. flood-relief fund
,£13,000, and the donation was acknowledged in
some fine lines by the poet. He now asks shall
Maoriland “ mourn in vain ” ? Bananalanders
seem to be just going to let her mourn.
Among other letters received by Louis
Becke asking for information about the South Sea
Islands, was one from Maoriland asking him if a
well-educated girl could make a living by teaching
traders’ children. Becke is in a quandary how to
explain that traders’ children don’t all live under
the parental roof, and that there is no Brands
Act in Polynesia.
Mr. “ Banjo ” Paterson has at length been
persuaded to cease steeplechase riding, in which
congenial pastime he has experienced many narrow
escapes and some severe injuries. Of his last
eight cross-country races he won four, though on
no occasion did he ride the favorite.
Old R. H. Budd, famous in the annals of
Victorian education, kept an old-time school in
Victoria Parade, Melb. One of his pupils, says
Budd, was a reserved, shy little boy, meek and
docile. This particular brand of boy-angel de-
veloped later into the gentle Purves, Q.C.
Young “Charley” Martin, a son of the
late Chief-J ustice, has passed the preliminary ex-

dinners should be an easy task.
Said that the British Government is going
to take the unusual step of having a “ Trial at
Bar” in Dr. Jameson’s case. This takes place
before a full bench as well as a jury. The Vic-
torian contracting case of Cornish v. Bruce, years
ago, was the most notable civil case of this nature
in Australia.

Melb. demise : John Robb, erstwhile
leviathan contractor, almost the Brassey of Aus-
tralia. He brought into the boom a mass of
capital wrung out of railway contracts, and yet
did not escape a painful overhauling, which
virtually slew him—for he had not the corky light-
ness of the farthing in the <£ man.
James Fowler, sen., runs Cooktown Inde-
pendent while Fowler, jun., runs the local
Beacon. Fowler pbre, alludes in print to Fowler,
fils, as “ This gay young cock-a-doodle-doo,” &c.
Out of family ructions may be plucked the “ true
innardness ”of things. The Northern public is
interestedly watching the Fowlers.
Henry Parkes, Burdett Smith, John
Davies, J. F. Burns, and George Withers were all
interested as part-proprietors, or agents, in the
Holt-Sutherland improvements, which were made
the subject of a Royal Commission a few years
ago, and now the three first-named are dead and
the remaining two are at legal war.
Agent-General Playford will return to S.A.
shortly owing to his wife’s ill-health. He means
to stand for the Leg. Council. It is just about
time Tom returned. Photos, have reached Adel-
aide of the ex-market-gardener rigged up like a
scarecrow in Court-dress, and with his large left
hand clutching a tin sword. Cheap cauliflower!
The “ severe abrasion ” of Gov. Brassey’s
nose through falling from his bike turned out to
be a very mild calamity. Brassey has the kind of
nose that would seem not much the worse for a
prize-fight. There’s nothing of the ancient Roman
about H.E.’s foremost feature, which harmonises
with his commonplace whiskers. Now, if Secre-
tary Wallington were to descend heavily on his
organ of smell !
Amongst the names on the Newcastle list
of volunteers for the proposed N.S.W. “Defence
Guard ” appears that of Thos. Maxwell Walsh—a
wiry-looking old fellow who gives his age as 74,
and his previous service as with the 70th Foot;
46th Foot; Military Train; Land Transport
Corps ; and Peshawur Light Horse. He holds
medals for the Crimean War, Indian Mutiny,
Sutlej Campaign, and Maori war.
Parkes once received a deputation of ladies
in N.S.W. Parliamentary Library. As they were
departing he took down a valuable book from the
shelves and handed it to the spokeswoman—a
well-known woman-suffragist—having first oblig-
ingly inscribed it—“ To Mrs. W , from Henry
Parkes.” Shortly afterwards, one of the members
requiring the book, its whereabouts was ascer-
tained and a messenger sent after it, who re-
claimed and brought it safely back.
Hon. W. Hart, the Tas. M.L.C. whose
name was allegedly forged upon a <£l2oo cheque
the other day, suffers from a presentiment that
he will die poor. He is one of the Tasmania
mine directors, a prominent Wesleyan, and oo-
trustee with manager Fitzgerald in the matter of
ijhe V.D.L. Bank lotteries. The Hon. Wm’s.
name doesn’t appear on the lottery ads. Fitz.
just signs “for self and co-trustee,” and the
M.L.C.’s conscience and lottery-hating church is
appeased.
The gloomy-looking J. P. Garvan, who,
when in N.S.W. Assembly, began most of his
speeches with, “ It is my sacred and solemn jooty,”
is to be major of the newly-formed N.S.W.
Irish Volunteer Brigade. So far, Mr. Garvan haa
been little, if at all, known in connection with
militarism, but, being a tiger to work, he may be
relied on to soon master his drill. A characteristic
story of him is that once being asked in his ex-
treme youth whether he would stay at home and
do sums or go to the circus he elected to do sums.
Which recalls the story of little Marcus Clarke
who, when asked by his white-haired maiden aunt
whether he would sing a hymn or have an orange,
replied “ Sing a hymn ” —and thereupon got two
oranges.
Begelhole the Great, erstwhile manager of
Bay ley’s Reward, turned up at North Fitzroy
(Melb.) police-station at 2 o’clock the other morn-
mg, telling a wondrous story about how he had
been chloroformed and robbed of <£2oo in cash and
jewellery by three men who had come from Melb.
with him per tram and alighted at the same time
to follow him to a dark spot. This was at 11,
explained the gallant captain, and he had not re-
covered consciousness for a couple of hours.
Begelhole can consider himself lucky. In some
places he would, while unconscious, have been
floated into a company of 200,000 shares, and
would have found on awaking that he had parted
with his immortal soul in exchange for 25,000 con-
tributing scrip.
Justice Simpson told barrister Armstrong
last week in court that it was not a barrister’s
duty to submit evidence simply because he was
instructed to do so ; on the contrary, that it was
a barrister’s duty to assist in the administration of
justice. The implication here is the same old one,
which the Dean-Meagher case should have deter-
mined as a rule of lawyer-life, but which the
courts have left to individual opinion as before.
Napoleon 1., when setting up his Commandments,
wrote on one table “ Advocates in law-courts shall
never speak but for the truth. ” But long ere he
started for Moscow he broke that table in two.
It means,” he said after, “ the death of the pro-
fession ; I might as well demand that soldiers
shall never fight except when on the side of
Right.”
The truth about little Dr. Maloney,
M.L.A., who has got himself in bad odour in
Melbourne by going on tour in India with
Richard, alias Geismardo, the “electric healer,”
shows up rather more to his credit than has been
represented. The facts related by those who know
the circumstances are that Dr. Maloney landed
himself in debt, through no fault of his own, but
through the treachery of a “ friend.” His medical
practice was large, but he never refused to attend
a poor patient for nothing, and in other cases those
who said they could not afford to pay were not
pressed. Richard offered him the chance of earn-
ing a big sum by doing genuine medical and
surgical work in company with his (Richard’s)
electric racket, and Maloney, seeing here a chance
of paying off his debts, accepted the offer. It is
so rare to find a Melbourne man making any sacri-
fice to pay his debts that the instance is note-
worthy. Maloney is coming back soon. He will
not resign his seat, but will resume polities and his
largely-charitable medical practice.

INTERESTING TO LADY CYCLISTS
HICKS, ATKINSON & SONS,
Collins-st. , Melbourne,
Are now prepared to make, under Mr. B. King’s
special supervision, Tailor-made Cycling Jacket
and Patent Skirt of first-class durable tailoring
tweeds of the newest patterns, scientifically
cut stylishly made, from 4 guineas.
The Skirt is a special design by Mr. B. King,
and it is protected by Royal Letters Patent in
Victoria and N.S. Wales.
It is claimed for this Patent for small Cycling
Skirt (the first patent of the kind ever taken
out in the world) that it is now recognised and
thoroughly approved by the best and most
fashionable Lady’s Tailoring Firms in London
as giving, above all others, the greatest possible
satisfaction.
The main points of this Patent are :
1. Simplicity, modesty, and neatness.
2. Perfect safety from entanglement in the
machine.
3. Being small and scientifically cut, the
Skirt always retains its proper position ;
does not catch the wind so much as other
skirts, and yet gives ample room'and
perfect freedom for the limbs.
4. It is so constructed that it can be trans-
formed into an invisible divided skirt if
required.
Numerous testimonials expressing the highest
approval of B. King’s Patent Skirt have been
received.

the gold free-pass for life on N. S. W. railways
would, it is said, be most interesting. Ministers
of four years’ standing are entitled to it, officials
say, but the question is—Are these the only
wearers ?
Premier Reid says that the rumor that
one of his Ministers is about to leave the Govern-
ment is “ wild and foundationless.” It would, in-
deed, be a wild thing for anyone of the calibre of
Cook, Garrard, or Young to leave 1500 lovely
sovereigns a year.
Is Mr. Simpson, who asks for statutory
power to build a bridge over Sydney Harbour, the
gentleman who got a Parliamentary concession
some years ago to build a certain railway in the
Parramatta district ? And if he is, did he or any-
one else ever build that railway ?
Melbourne Age item: “Michael Munza,
George Schroeder, Leo de Hardt, Heinrich Helm-
quist, William Soderquist, and Andrew Johnston,
all seamen on board the British ship Westward
Ho, were brought before the City Court yesterday
charged with disobeying orders,” &c. Five mis-
cellaneous Scandinavians and a Scotchman ! The
British seaman !
Expected that “Turncoat Bill” Copley
will lead the Ass party in S.A. Assembly. This
is the man who introduced the Free Education
and Payment of Members Bills into S.A. Council,
and is now elected as a pronounced opponent of
the same measures ! The Ass party in the Assem-
bly, by the way, numbers about 16, and there
are at least six candidates for the leadership.
Some time ago a gang of Kanakas on the
Herbert were unloading manure from Torrens
Creek meat-works. The overseer found them lazy
and proceeded to stir them up. Hereupon the
islanders “ struck.” “ Too much stinkum,” they
complained; and when the manager arrived the
dusky spokesman pleaded, “ Guv’ment no likem
this sort work longa Kanak ; he white man work.’’
“ I am in favor of one vote for manhood
and one for thrift,” said candidate Tom Bent at
S. Melb. Gall —astounding gall! Bent, the
arch-boomster, part-author of the financial reign
of terror and of the preceding inflation that
flourished on the savings of the thrifty, posing as
an apostle of thrift, an encourager of thrift, an
advocate of frugality and money-hoarding on the
part of the workers !
The special meeting of the Trades Hall
body whose duty it was to convrm or reject the
S. Melb. Labor League’s nomination for that
much-wooed electorate, was called by an obscure
advt. in one paper on the morning of the meeting.
Many members did not know of it till next day.
As the meeting was fought with closed doors, the
whole thing has as unpleasant an odor about it
as anything else in this grossly-mismanaged elec-
tion.
Tactics at a certain Queensland polling-
place—or perhaps several of them. Two com-
partments for voters; one is provided with
blotting-paper, the other isn’t. The Democratic
voter, whenever recognised, is sent into the com-
partment where there is no blotting-paper. Con-
sequently he, in most cases, folds up his paper
with the ink still wet, and the ink spreads over the
paper and makes the vote illegible. Rejected as
informal.
William Gaunson, David’s little brother
Bill, stood for Melb. City Council the other day,
and was licked by a seven-to-one majority. Little
Bill Gaunson nowadays stands for pretty nearly
every Parliamentary or City Council or other
vacancy, and the voters throw him out with pain-
ful regularity, and he comes back again next time
to be thrown out some more. Every dull thud
that is heard anyw r here in Victoria now is assumed
off-hand to be the bump of W. Gaunson’s head as
he is thrown out. After his latest defeat W.G.
announced that “he felt it his duty to contest
every vacancy,” and he was going to do it regard-
less of consequences. The statement was received
with scorn by an audience which refused to regard
Gaunson as a real individual. It is an awful thing
to have no individuality of your own, and to be
simply somebody’s brother Bill.
Bent’s appearance as a candidate created
profound disgust in South Melbourne, where the
electors roll up manfully to the meetings of the
Brighton Boomer, and raise Sheol about his large,
purple ears. South Melbourne feels hurt, and if
Thomas doesn’t lose his £5O
it will be an astonishing and
disgraceful thing.
Nowadays a Q. deputa-
tion asks the visiting Minis-
ter two things : Will he pro-
vide a clock for the local
Post-office tower ? and will
he build a lazaret for the
local lepers ?
Frank Madden, M.L.A.,
that specially Heaven-born
member of a loquacious
Smellbourne family, has
found a Cause for the “ de-
generacy or complete lack of
Australian national charac-
ter.” Socialism is the cause
—vile, disgraceful Socialism,
which prompts any half-
dozen of boys who club to-
gether, whether for football
or cricket purposes, to pester
distinguished public persons
for subscriptions.” Madden,
who evidently speaks as a
d.p.p., is confusing Socialism
with Tory crawlsomeness. A
true Socialist is a good
Democrat, and a good Demo-
crat doesn’t seek unwilling
contributions to any sort of
club. The boys who pester
Madden are mostly the de-
generate offspring of the
snobs who send him to Par-
liament.
The N.S.W. Parliamentary-party at the
back of the Truck Bill, now ushered into notice for
the severalth time, should, while at it, make the
measure cover in unequivocal words the deductions
made by hosts of employers on the score of sick-
pay t.e., pay for prospective medical attendance,
1 his was the most difficult part of the English
truck Act,
worded so as to defeat ingenious devices, and it is
not regarded as perfect even now.
S. A. democrats have had enough of the
Absent-Voters Act. Originally intended for sea-
men absent on duty, it was extended to all voters,
At the recent election the Ass crowd worked the
Act for all it was worth, the same elector in many
CONSOLATION, ,
B OBBY: “ Ooh, boo-hoo-hoo! I bumped me nose agen the water-tank, boo-hoo!”
HIS SISTER (sympathetically): “Never mind, Bobby ; you didn’t mean to do it ”
cases voting twice ; some even voted who had been
in Westralia for months. Two Tory members
were elected by small majorities owing to these
tactics, and the Act will be either radically
amended or repealed altogether this year.
Democracy and orthodox religion don’t
love one another any too well—especially in the
North. The “ godless ” Towers returns two
Labor men ; “godly ” Townsville puts in two typi-
cal Fat Men. In the West and North the sound
of the church bell doesn’t peal out, in some dis-
tricts, once in six months —and the men are the
most democratic in Australia. Said a Labor
M.L.A. some time ago : “ There’s neither church
nor chapel, priest nor parson in my electorate—
and I hope there never will be.”
ABOVE SUSPICION
BOSS COOKIE : “ Look here, Gecko, that dog of yours has been
worrying my sheep again. "
GECKO (very “civilised”): “No, no — mine dog longa tima bin one
vegetarian.”
Premier Reid’s offer of moral support to
Great Britain during the Transvaal trouble calls
up a curious inconsistency in the advocates of Im-
perialism. The stock argument for the “eonnec-
tion” and attachment to the throne, &c., is the abso-
lute necessity of Australia being defended by Bri-
tain. But on the first flutter of diplomatic trouble,
Britain is rushed with offers of assistance from “the
colonies,” and wild speeches of promise from Pre-
miers and other loyal persons. If Britain is strong
enough to protect us, is it not babyish to offer her
aid • If she is not, and wants our assistance,
what chance have we ? The question is-—ls
Britain our big b. other Bill ? Or are we Britain’s
big brother Bill ? Or are both parties equally Bill?
It is not only by the free-carriage of
newspapers themselves that N.S. Wales loses
a big revenue. Journals often cover letters,
and such light articles as samples of dress-
material, laces, ribbons, etc. Women, the
authorities find, are the greatest offenders;
they will take great risks to save post-
age. A while back the Sydney P.O. officials found
a long letter hidden in the folds of a paper, plain-
tively asking addressee, “ Why don’t you answer
my letters ? ” and containing the confession, “this
is the third letter this week that I have sent you
in the S.M. Herald.” " The authorities were able
to trace the writer of that letter because she—it
was a lady, as usual—gave name and address.
But the revenue-defrauders rarely give themselves
away thus. All the authorities can do when they
discover surreptitiously-inserted matter is to keep
back the papers and confiscate the enclosures.
But as the papers, etc., are usually carried to their
destination before being searched—if they are
searched at all—the country has to bear the cost
of carriage just the same. N.S.W. and Tasmania
are the only countries in the world that quietly
submit to the free-postage steal.
Why the Boer loves the Briton. In 1815
there was a Boer rising in the Eastern province
as a protest against the British annexation’,
which was suppressed with great severity. Five
of the leaders were condemned to be hanged, and
the sentence was carried out before a large’ con-
course of people. Unfortunately, the gallows
broke down under the weight of the five, and the
hapless men, reviving, crawled to the feet of the
commanding-officer and prayed for mercy. .
At sunset, they obtained all there was to spare'
and were formally hanged again. . . . Sounds
like a chapter out of Botany Bay.
Some Queanbeyan (N.S.W.)electioneering
tactics. At last election, friends of Palmer, the
Freetrade candidate, tired of raising a futile
sectarian cry against E. W. O’Sullivan, resorted
to the dodge of writing to the old Irish farmers
stating that their man was approved of by Card.
Moran, and that the local priest had got instruc-
tions to secure his return. Did O’Sullivan resent
that dodge ? Not much. He got hold of one of
the letters and had it printed and posted to all the
ultra-Protestants of the district. Result—the
Protestants, believing that Palmer might really
be the Cardinal’s nominee, polled for the Holy
Roman, who actually beat Palmer in his native
district by a large majority.
Tom Bent didn’t know he was politically de-
funct till last week. The ex-Speaker reckoned that
the moral and physical support of wrestler Victor
would duly impress the muscular Christians of
Sowth Melbourne, and get a hearing for him, but
Tom’s calculations were ridiculed by the result.
The meeting howled unanimously at Tom, and
heaped scorn on Mons. V. when that faded athlete
attempted to rally round the orator. The discom-
fiture of both bull-necked gentlemen was complete.
Bent gave the cue for Victor to say something,
and the baldheaded Frenchman fired off a protest.
Everything depended on the reception given to
Victor, who was promptly routed by the voice of
one crying from the body of the hall—“ Get your
’air cut. ”
The modest John Tighe Ryan in Gun-
dag a i Times on the N.S.W. Governor’s speech
to Parliament :
From a literary point of view, this State clocuiir nt is
perhaps the worst ever printed, and it is not too much to
say that it is a disgrace to the province. Even the refer-
ence to the death of Sir Henry Parkes is not made in
correct English, and the veteran statesman is robbed of
the titles conferred upon him by the Queen. In an
ordinary communication or newspaper article this would,
of course, be overlooked, but it is a breach of courtesy
and an ignorance of that gracious ceremony which should
characterise State documents, in a speech by the Gover-
nor at the opening of Parliament, of which he was for
many years the guiding light and the principal adorn-
ment. We are given to understand, however, in slipshod
language that the children of the statesman have a claim
upon the national gratitude.
This is the first time The Bulletin has learned
that any Governor was ever a “ guiding light and
principal adornment ” of Parliament. It is to be
hoped that Premier Reid (who, by the way, did
not continue to Mr. J. Tighe Ryan the free-pass
oyer all the N.S.W. railways granted by Dibbs) will
digest the grammatical lesson from so eminent an
authority.
The French Minister of Agriculture reports
that 23,000 horses, mules, and donkeys were
slaughtered for human consumption in Paris last
year. One-third of the horse-meat was sold at
butchers’ stalls, and the remainder cropped up in
“ bags of mystery.”
The name of “ E. Dyson ” at the foot of a
yarn or a bit of verse is familiar to all readers of
The Bulletin, and is generally accepted as a
guarantee that something well worth study lies
above it. Mr. Dyson’s book of verse, entitled
“ Rhymes from the Mines and Other Lines,” is to
be published in style by Angus and Robertson
next month, and will be supplied direct from this
office.

John Hunter, boot-manufacturer and im-
porter, has 70 establishments altogether in N.S.-W.
and Queensland, with large factories at Sydney
and Brisbane. He employs over 1 00 hands, and,
besides his country brandies, he has salaried
travellers and commission -men who regularly do
the country. He went lately to London, where he
was called “The Australian Boot King,” and he
established a house there to deal direct with the
manufacturers of London, Paris, and Vienna, so
as to put goods on the Australian market at lowest
possible prices. And from London he brought the
latest bootmaking machinery, so as to manufacture
here on the most economical lines. He is now also
developing his mercery business, the stock of
which, in the wholesale department alone, repre-
sents £30,000 —very considerably less, however,
than the boot stock. The Strand Arcade Mercery
Bazaar is his; the well and favorably-known
mercery business of J. C. Eley, in Hunter-street,
has lately become his ; he has also annexed the 50
years’ established business of Smith and Mannel,
shirtmakers, mercers, &c. These the enterprising
John Hunter will shortly open in his own name,
with a big discount-sale to lend eclat to the occa-
sion. He has more mercery-shops at Broken Hill,
Parramatta, Newcastle, &c. ; he has 12 grindery-
shops in Sydney and Brisbane; he has lately
opened a new and handsome bootshop in King-
street, Sydney ; and he is going to increase and
improve his City Boot Palace. Further, he will
shortly move from his present warehouse into one
of the largest warehouses in Sydney.*
The helpless way in which the average
man or woman potters along with obsolete means
and methods is one of the saddest features of Aus-
tralian semi-civilisation. There is no experiment,
no initiative, no seeking for better things among
our people. The importance of diet to brain,
bone, and muscle is regarded by dull and stupid
intellects as a fad ; they do not get within miles of
the idea that the stomach is the last organ to trifle
with ; they never seem to realise that just as poison
taken into the stomach kills, so wholesome food
produces health and strength. The winter is now
on us, and porridge is the order for breakfast.
Those people who want to know what makes the
healthiest porridge should remember the name
Gillespie’s Flaked Grainea. *
Computed that in London there are at
least 50,000 families so poor as to have but one
room per family.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The early-betting publio got a crumpler through
hot quarries goinsr out of S.T.C. Royal Stakes and Cups.
Forrester scratched the favorite, Milkmaid, for the shorter
race, standing by Lord Rosebery, and some unfeeling
brutes weren’t sorry when he ran last. Akarini’s win repre-
sented something good to her heavy-plunging stable.
The filly’s alliterative combination, Mentor-Mitrailleuse,
makes her one of the best-bred in the land. Her dam
was one of Maoriland’s fastest flyers. Two-year-old Huret
was conspicuous near home, and ran third, the missing-
link being Patrona. Any of half a dozen would have won,
so close up were they, but for the winner.
As chasers, the 10 entrants for S. T. Club’s
steeple weren’t very safe conveyances. Seven either fell
or refused. Othello, the M.L. horse, who has been
dodging round for something easy, smothered Grandwing
in the final sprint. He was unfancied. Thor’s hurdles
victory was a greater surprise. Beaten off at Rosehill
just previously, he made snails of his field on this occa-
sion.
When a stable gets a lightly-weighted old ’un in
a race, it doesn’t have to finesse much for a market, if he
belongs to Buckley’s division. Cooee, with 6.8, w’on
S. T, Club Handicap from start to finish, landing a cosy
pile for his party. Punters never even thought of such an
unpretentious crock.
Gov. Buxton looked like a fish out of water on
the last day of Adelaide Cup meeting. The V.R. party
was huddled up in the grand-stand all the afternoon,
except when H.E. inspected the totalisator, and the sad-
ness of the occasion was only relieved by the offer of a
cheeky “ tipster” to put His Ex. on to a “dead snip” for
the Steeple.
The biggest divs. at Adelaide R.C. were in two
minor selling-races—£22 9s. and £4B 6s.
Mostyn and Destiny landed a handsome double
for R. Barr Smith in City Handicap and Cup, paying £9
3s. and £l9 11s. respectively. Mostyn is a great weight-
packer over a short course. Destiny, who downed a swell
field, has always had “ expectations,” but Hova’s last
wasn’t the champion’s true form.
Trentham made no impression in Adelaide Birth-
day Cup. He appears to want a spell. St. Albans’ could
only land a small stake at the meet with the fine-looking
Koran.
• * * *
,£3OO to £lOO against Newhaven for V.R.C.
Derby was booked to a leading Adelaide sport last week.
Big risk for the money, and he may get the price three
months hence.
• * * *
Noted that big clubs generally caution pro-
minent jocks., who have been cautioned before, instead of
passing them out. Saddle cracks seem to think they can
do as they like because they ride for big owners. Their
calculations don’t go very wide of the mark. Influence
means immunity.
* * * *
Adelaide is a sure refuge for all the bookies who
have had to take hurried flight from Sydney and Mel-
bourne. Disqualification of a “ book ”in Melb." applies to
Sydney, and vice-versa, but Adelaide does not reciprocate,
and prominent S.A. sports are urging a move in that
direction. At present Adelaide shelters more shady pen-
cillers than any other Australian city, despite the totali-
sator. Destitute of cash for straight-out wagering, most
of these fiends are double-eventers. The first event for
backers is to strike the double, and the second to collect
the money.
* * * *
Arrived at last. Dunedin (M.L.) club now
brackets an owner’s string and pays out if one scores.
The public should relish the innovation, which goes far to
abolish hanky-panky. How would Ikey Mo like to
pay out two prads for the one investment ?
* * * ♦
Phil. Glenister says Humphrey Oxenham is the
biggest bettor Australia ever had, Joe Thompson included.
* * * *
“Thediv. paid on Nomadic (in the S.A.J.C.
Totalisator Handicap), £39 55., was one of the ‘ healthy
sort,’ and will provide The Bulletin with another argu-
ment in favor of the tote against the bookmaker, albeit
the latter will ever remain a necessary to the turf,” says
Adelaide Standard. Nonsense. Just as the starting-
machine is superseding the jockey-fining man with the
flag, so the legalised betting-machine must in the end
down and abolish the short-odds-laying Ikey Mos.
* * * *
A Melb. sporting pen critic wails about the
tote’s grasping 10 per cent, deduction policy. But he
omits to mention that the percentage is devoted to in-
creasing stake-values. Ikey Mo increases nothing, so far
as is visible, except his stomach and his bank-balance.
* * * *
M.L. people are already getting a foretaste of
what will happen should Premier Seddon kick down the
tote next session. At all tote-prohibited country meet-
ings spielers and mushroom bookies welsh and balance on
every hand. Punters must bet, and, if there’s no machine,
so much the worse for the bettors. Backing losers causes
much vexation of spirit, but backing winners and getting
no div. is an unutterable thing.
* * * *
Another gamble-inducing firm has sent out its
probable-Cup-nomination list, and odds against each. One
mentioned beauty was the other day tried among gallo-
ways. Another now trots his owner to church.
* * * *
At a Sydney club last week a prominent sport
solemnly averred that next Melb. Cup would be won by a
hurdler.
* * • *
Towers (Q.) pressmen have an eye to the main
chance. Reporters told local club-members at a general
meeting that one race entrant had been baptised with beer
“ for advertising purposes,” and that if people wanted to
advertise their beer they could do so at scale-rates. It
was suggested that the prad be re-christened Gingerbeer.
* * * »
Not improbable that measures will soon be taken
to make all persons dealt with by clubs for cronk prac-
tices amenable to criminal law also. The great cronk
crowd could then pace round the gaol-yard in broken
time, and sleep on the premises.
• * • •
In addition to ordinary consultations, a Johan-
nesburg promoter has a ten-thousand-pounder on Epsom
Derby ; divided amongst first three only.

Sydney “ silver ” betting biz is a worse nuisance
than it was when “ shops ” were unrestricted. Then
people walked in, made their bets, and departed in peace.
Now,' one cannot go window-gazing in certain streets
without being asked by “gents of the class” if he fane’es
anything. The exemptions are females, parsons, and
peelers, a doubtful betting trio—in public, at all events.

The latest Australian definition of a rowing
“amateur” excludes bookmakers. Fancy Ikey Me pull-
ing himself blind in an eight-thwart racing shell!

The Australians won their Crystal Palace m:.t :h
against an “Eleven of England” on their merits un-
doubtedly, but the crushing completeness of the victory
really seems to need explanation. The London press Lad
written disparagingly of our men, and the “gates ” were
likely to suffer in consequence. The Englishmen, mostly
professionals with no incentive to distinguish themselves
in a scratch-match of this sort, must surely have played a
very loose game. On paper it was about the most re-
markable feat ever achieved by an Australian Eleven
abroad. Fine weather, wicket “lively” all the time.
Englishmen (winning the toss), 114 and 39; Australians,
374 —an innings and 221 runs to spare. Previous to which
they had done only fairly well against Essex, a second-
rate county.
Cyclist O’Hehir, the Ballarat top-notch road
rider, is a bench-hand at a sawmill. Years ago air the
fingers of his left hand were cut off, and a few months
back he unfortunately lost three from his right fist. Yet
he is riding again with his old-time pluok and vigor.
A cheerless day, lumpy water, crossing steamers,
and other assorted oddments of bad luck turned the inter-
provincial rowing spins into a mermaids’ picnic. Vic. won
the fours by XJ lengths from M.L., after fouling the latter,
a set of young giants, whose boat was lowest in the water,
and could have been sent along faster if its crew feathered
higher. The islanders were handicap}, ed by bad steering,
too, and bow nearly “crabbed ” once through viewing the
dismal scenery. N.S.W. men were the worst watermen.
Referee Simpson unwisely gave his decision on M.L.’s pro-
test before hearing the evidence, admitting afterwards
that he hadn’t clearly seen all that transpired. Champion
Slack (Q.) had an uneasy, but decisive, win in the
sculls from Bannister (N.S.W.) M‘Cormack (M.L.), third,
amply demonstrated near the finish that he was a fast
calm-water puller.

Wanted a new cricket rule for cases like this :
Katanning and Broomihill C.C.’s were playing at Katan-
ning, W.A. ; batsman struck ball hard and full to leg, it
struck the back of the umpire, rebounded towards striker’s
wicket, and was caught at short-leg. The assaulted um-
pire, on appeal, ruled “ caught out.”

A disgusted Englishman wouldn’t stop to see
the Grecian Olympian games. “ The king and suite, and

and cheered lustily when one cove jumped only sft. 2in.”

Felix, Jun.: “The Australian physique is evinced
by the fact that, so far as I know, none of our cricketers
sent to England are dead, unless Midwinter be included.”
* * * *
Sporting papers constantly refer to Chandler’s
famous jump of 39ft. over water at Warwick. The gentle-
man, Col. Harrison Broadley, who rode him on that occa-
sion, has just died. He was a grand old fellow, and a
great friend of the late Tom Crommelin, one of the finest
sportsmen of the century, who died in Sydney. Mr.
Crommelin saw the horse make the celebrated leap, and
he essayed to equal it in cold blood the next day, and
very nearly succeeded, his old horse Waterloo (or Welling-

A Melb. correspondent :—“ Re your remark
apropos of Interprovincial Eight-Oar Race, ‘great is
George Upward ’; it is but fair to state that Irving was
the only man who received any coaching from him.
Five of the others got all their tuition from Sid. Edwards,
of boat-building fame. 'As for the ‘ hall-mark of Geo.
Upward,’ which appeared in the Age a week ago, that is
utter nonsense.” —Fair Play.

Phil. Glenister, the veteran turf-commissioner,
lately grew reminiscent in Adelaide over Melb. Cup in ’BB.
Mentor, he says, won £20,000 for the owner and 1:30,000
for Glenister and his friends. When Chester won the Cup
in ’79, Phil, backed Savanaka, the favorite, for £43,000
without leaving the room, in one night. First Water,
second in ’B3, was backed for £60,000 in Sydney alone.
Carbine won £40,000 altogether, one wager laid to Wallace
being £21,800 to £lO2O. Even Nada was backed for
£33,000. “ Somehow or other,” says Phil., “Wilson, of
St. Albans, seems to have no luck in Melb. Cup. Carnage,
Strathmore, and Nada all ran into places, and the latter
would have won had he not been interfered with.”
* * * *
W. T. Jones swears by Anwin, who won Melb.
Cup for him on Bravo, beating Carbine, and has engaged
him to ride Newhaven in liis future races. Also, he may
go ’Ome when the colt goes.
* *' * *
No wonder silver double-books pay ! In a (say)
£lO to Is. chance, the same odds rule all round, the
rankest weeds and the choicest plums being booked at the
same price. There are always backers of even the worst,
too, especially when it’s thought the best aren’t taking
any.
* * * *
An old-time M.L. sport-contributor, possessing
excellent horsey judgment but wretched grammatical
qualifications, arranged with the turf-ignorant “ sub.” to
elaborate his notes. The partnership flourished until
one day the “elaborator” went into ecstacies over the
performances of a well-bred gelding, whose probable great
success at the stud he lefigthily dilated upon. The much-
lauglied-at and greatly-shamed contributor entered the
office groggy, threw down his cigar, and expressed his
feelings in fistic fashion. During the fight the cigar set
fire to the littered room, and the brigade had to be rung
out. The man of tips resigned right away, and the next
day the paper came out with a fiery article, headed “ The
Curse of Horse-racing.”
* * * *
The high-jumping Mazeppa was once a cab-
horse ; dragged a wood-and-water cart, and a vegetable
van ; was originally a whim-turner, and is now, perhaps,
the best high-jumper in Australia.
* * * *
Ika, a minor Steeple-winner in M.L., is out of
a draught mare. His sire got Kingfish, whose 1.40 for
Hawkesbury (N.S.W.) Guineas has never been equalled.

A. H. Holder, jumping badly, recently cut
down the M.L. amateur quarter-mile hurdle record, held
by “Wairarapa” Roberts (Auckland), to 60sec., after
winning a lOOyds.-race from scratch in 10 l-ssec. Holder,
a one-time pro., stood down for two years, and was offi-
cially “ whitewashed.”

Marmion, the ex-steeplechaser, is now running
in a Sydney boot-manufacturer’s cart.
* * * *
A N.S.W. up-country football crowd objected
to play its opponents when the time came because a
colored man had a place in the team. Unique in latter
day Australian athleticism. A heavy, stoushing, ebony-
visaged black certainly is objectionable—if he’s not on
your side. A great many think football a niggers’
game, anyway.
* * * *
A diminutive pony-riding Sydney nonentity
joined the Salvation Army the other day, on the off
chance of getting something to eat occasionally.
* * * *
If pony-clubs offered substantial monetary prizes
to the jocks, who rode most winners at their meets within
a given time, the sudden resuscitation of dead-’uns occa-
sionally would surprise owners as much as the public.
* * * *
Redleap won for the Messrs. Miller all the
money expended on the handsome stables that they have
named after him. The stables are, in fact, a monument
to the memory of the great ’chaser, who, in the M.’s
opinion, might have run away with a Melb. Cup if they
could have brought him fit to the post. Redleap, they
say, was never really well but once, when he won the
l’lemington G.N. Hurdle Race with a trifle over 9st. on
his back and any amount of weight in hand. He went
amiss before the Steeplechase of a week later, which fell
to Eaglet, their “ second string.” Two years later the big
un was sufficiently fit to win the double event, Hurdle
and Steeple, followed shortly by the four miles’ Steeple at
Caulfield. After which it was impossible to train him.

The Public Service Board’s recent investi-

for one thing, in the Board away armed with
a list containing 40 names of officials found guilty
of being over the regulation age of 60. It is dis-
cretionary with the Board to either retrench or
retain all these officials. But when they reach 65
the Act leaves no choice but retrenchment.

A TERRIBLE CASE OF

the sad condition of her little daugh-

“My daughter was afflicted with
Eczema of the most aggravated
type. The disease first appeared in
eruptions on her head, then her hair
began to fall out, and in spite of
the best medical advice and treat-
ment she grew steadily worse. The
sores were full of matter and were
extremely offensive. Her eyes be-
came affected, and she was, in truth,
in a terrible state. My neighbors
were very sympathetic and took
great interest in the case. They
persuaded me to try Ayer’s Sarsa-
parilla, and I am most thankful to
be able to say that this wonderful
medicine completely restored my
daughter’s health. She has now as
good a head of hair as anyone could
wish, her eyes are perfectly well,
and she is a fine girl of eight years
with every prospect of growing up
to be a strong and healthy woman/’

“Pet” Names in Court.
Melbourne Insolvency Court is a sordid place where
simple expressions of conjugal love are held ridiculous,
ine other day, when a turf was under
examination, counsel started to read one of insolvent’s
letters to his wife, beginning, “ My darling Snoozer,” and
the Court broke out into loud laughter. Yet there was a
world of poetic suggestion in that pet name. The Bulle-
tin finds it positively inspiring. Music fills the office air,
and a gentle flapping of invisible plumes seem to fan our
heated fancies :
Guard her, angels, while she sleeps,
Nigh her pillow hover ;
Dry the tear she, dreaming, weeps
For her husband-lover.
Honey from her lips I’d take,
Like a thirsty boozer,
Were it not unkind to wake
My own darling Snoozer.
Fair the form that lies at rest,
Fair each facial feature ;
Nature grants no whiter breast
To a human creature.
Were all women mine to woo,
Could I be a chooser
Of a sweeter spouse than you ?
No, my darling Snoozer.
Guard her, angels, night and day,
Peace and comfort give her
Till her spirit wings away
To the shining river.
When she draws her final breath
Say not I must lose her,
Let me share the sleep of death
With my darling Snoozer.
Rabbit-lies from the Never-Never. Up-
river man to Down-river man : “ Our rabbits—
why, our rabbits leap fences like cats.” Down-
river man : “ Ours roost on ’em like fowls.” Up-
river man : “ if ours ain’t started to gnaw
through the rabbit-netting to get in to water.”
Down-river man : “ Oh, we poison the wires, and
darned if they haven’t started to root out the posts
now.”
An S.A. farmer, noticing that white ants
don’t attack posts set up in salt swamps, has
solved the ant-problem by putting into each post-
hole, when filled within 6in. of the surface, a
shovelful of salt, and completing with soil as
before. The salt impregnates the subsoil water
round the posts, which rises and so salts the posts
effectually. In saltlake country the posts can
simply be soaked in the lakes for a few months.
Extract from the land-tax schedule of a
farmer located about sixty miles from Sydney :
I have 45 acres of land. The unimproved value is nil,
as the cost of the improvements I have made is three
times as much as the present selling-value of the land and
improvements combined, and the 5 per cent, interest paid
to the Government on the balance owing is more than the
rental value of the whole property. There are thousands
of acres of Government land adjoining me, east and
south, that is unimproved except with my dividing-fence.
This land has been open for sale for the last 30 years, at
the usual £1 per acre, without getting a single bid. The
above presents a picture of farm life after 30 j-ears of toil,
from 12 to 16 hours per day, contending with floods,
droughts, fires, and low markets. The Government has
taken its lb. of flesh out of it, and the mortgage (or death-
grip) will have to be handed down to posterity. The only
thing left me is the bone, and I am seriously thinking of
letting the Government and the mortgagee' fight for the
bone, as I am simply working for nix to grease these two
old fat sows. There is no unearned increment on the
land, and never has been. Perhaps Premier Reid will find
us billets in the Civil service.

Very fat-cheeked man (respectably dressed) after
swigging off his whisky, is reminded that it is not
paid for. Searches pockets and declares he has
changed his coat and has no money, but will go
back to office and pay directly. “ Look here, sir,”
says the barman, “ don’t go back. Just sell that

A new poem has lately been discovered
among some Hindu MSS. unearthed at Benares
(India). The author, Ali Muhibb Khan, was the
Laureate of the day, and his masterpiece, brought
to light after a few centuries of seclusion, suggests
a new poetical theme. It is entitled “ Khatmal
Baisi, or Twenty-two Stanzas in praise of the
Bug ” ! The preface perorates to this effect: —•
“ Tigers fear him—snakes and elephants, the
mightiest kings on earth, heaven and hell fly
before him—nay Death himself when he descends
to carry away a fleeting soul refuses to approach
the sick man’s bed if it be infested by the mighty
birnex !” A hint to Alfred Austin.

Tasmania badly wants police centralisation.
Territorial police are more or less under State
control, while the municipal Robert generally
manages to control the municipality. The police-
superintendent of a rural municipality has all the
powers of a Crown prosecutor, with necessarily
few qualifications for the position ; the municipal
warden has all the powers of a R. M. with still
fewer qualifications for the billet than the Superin-
tendent has for his. One depends largely on the
other for continuance in office, and the combina-
tion constitutes a double-barrelled monarchy of
mutual interests which exercises almost despotic
power in the administration of justice, and plays
high jinks with the morals of the community.
The other day a whole family were arraigned on a
charge of arson, their furniture, and even their
clothing, was forcibly taken possession of by the
police Superintendent, and every possible legal
indignity was heaped upon the suspects prior to
their committal for trial. The Crown Law
authorities, powerless to interfere with the local
magnates earlier, characterised the prosecution as
a persecution, and the Attorney-General refused
to file a bill. Local Government as applied to the
police force finds its reductio ad absardum, in
Tasmania, where a man on the rampage can evade
arrest by simply crossing a two-chain road into
another district when the locally-appointed bobby
heaves in sight. The policeman dare not cross the
boundary to effect an arrest, and the evil-doer
may, with impunity, hurl blue-metal at the
majesty of the law across the street, and pass rude
remarks concerning the size of the force’s feet.

The Land Board (subject, of course, to
appeal) has brought down the rent of Netley
station, on the Darling above Wentworth, N.S.W.
from 'Bld. to '3Bd. On this holding it is estimated
that the rabbits have reduced the carrying capacity
by more than GO per cent., notwithstanding that
the average cost of rabbit-destruction has been
.£670 per annum for 10 years. In the last five
years the average losses of sheep have been 15,000
a year. Of 21,000 lambs in 1895, only 3000 were
shorn, and this year 18,000 sheep have been lost
since the stock-returns went in. Add to this that
there is poor prospect of any lambing this season,
that the price of wool and stock has fallen, say'
33 per cent, net in 10 years, and you begin to get
an idea of what squatting at its worst is. Or,
rather, perhaps, since the owners can still more
than keep their heads above water, you get an idea
of what squatting was at its best.
The men of Malayta show a fine capacity
for civilisation. On ‘the labor-schooner Sybil,
when about to leave Maryborough, were found
some 20 rifles and revolvers,' about 1000 cartridges,
and six or seven pounds of dynamite.
THE AUSTRALIAN’GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Ehzabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a
quyer of all other Australian gems.*
A junior Sydney barrister was moving the
other day for a rule nisi for a new trial in an action
for damages caused to plaintiff’s property by the
spilling of nightsoil thereon, through the negli-
gence of defendant’s servants. The Court
pointed out that the error committed at the first
trial would easily be rectified at the second, and
that applicant’s client must eventually be unsuc-
cessful ; he was, therefore, asked whether it was
worth while proceeding. “ But surely,” came the
answer, “ they cannot recover if I prove it was an
act of God.” Spilling nightsoil an act of God!

ASTONISHING, isn’t it, that eighty out of every hundred manufacturers of Hair Restorers are
positively bald ! Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that we are fast becoming a bald-
headed people ! “ Physician, heal thyself ! ” could be most appropriately applied to these impostors
and charlatans. I can destroy all parasital growth as it affects the hair directly, but THESE parasites
I cannot remove. Their life or death is in your hands. Hitherto they have reaped a rich harvest at
your. expense. The result is the premature loss of your hair. You can stop their little game by
refusing to buy their nostrums. If you suffered from any ailment of body you would not consult a
bricklayer or a carpenter. You would go direct to a doctor who had made it a life’s study. Why
should you continue to use preparations that are manufactured by people who do not possess even an
elementary knowledge of the “ Hair and its treatment ? ”
Send two stamps for :rny Illustrated Pamphlet on the “Hair and its Treatment.” To all who
desire a good head of hair, it is worth its weight in gold. Every person who wishes to escape pre-
mature baldness cannot do better than use my
Marvellous Hair Restorer.
Thousands of Testimonials to hand prove that it contains all the essential elements necessary to
produce and to keep healthy a good head of hair.

A Micronesian Bade Debt.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
One day a Sydney vessel, loaded with
cocoa-nut oil and sandal-wood and bound for
China, appeared off the little island of Pingelap, in
the Caroline Group. At the time referred to the
sandalwood trade was carried on by ships whose
crews were assemblages of the most utter ruffians in
the Pacific Ocean, and this brigantine was no excep-
tion. There may have been grades of villainy in
the crew; perhaps if any one of them was more
blood-stained and criminal than the others it was
her captain.
There being no anchorage at Pingelap, the cap-
tain sailed in as close as he dared, and then hove-
to, waiting for the natives to come aboard with
some turtle. Presently a canoe shoved off, filled
with natives. As she pulled up alongside, the
captain glanced at the white man who was steer-
ing and his face paled. He turned quickly away
and went below.
* * * *
The mate of the sandal-wooder shook
hands with the white man and looked curiously at
him. Only by his speech could he be recog-
nised as an Englishman. His hair —long, rough and
black—fell on his shoulders like that of a native, A
white duck jumper was his only article of Euro-
pean clothing ; round his loins was a native girdle
of beaten cocoa-nut leaves. And his skin was as
dark as that of his savage native crew- -lie looked
and was a true Micronesian beachcomber.
“ You’re under mighty short canvas, my friend,”
said the mate of the vessel by way of pleasantry.
The man with the brown skin turned on him
savagely.
“ What the h —— is that to you ? I don’t dress
to please a pack of —— convicts and cut-throats.
Do you want to buy any turtle—that’s the ques-
tion. And where’s the captain ?■”
“Captain Watson has gone below sick, sir,”
said the steward, coming up and speaking to the
mate. “ He says not to wait for the turtle but to
fill away again. ”
“Can’t,” said the mate, sharply. “Tell him
there isn’t enough wind. What’s the matter with
him ? ”
“ Don’t know, sir. Only said lie was took bad
sudden.”
With an oath expressive of disgust the mate
turned to the beachcomber. “ You’ve had your
trouble for nothing, you see. The old man won’t
wait—why, what the h is wrong with you ? ”
* * * *
The bearded, savage-looking being was
leaning against a backstay, his hands tightly
clenched and his eyes fixed in a wild, insane stare.
He straightened himself up and spoke with an
effort.
“Nothing. I’m all right now. ’Tis a fearful
hot day, and the sun has giddied me a bit. But
gettin’ the turtle won’t delay you. I want tobacco
badly. You can have as many turtle as you want
for a couple of pounds o’ tobacco. ”
“Right,” said the mate, “that’s dirt-cheap.
Get ’em aboard as quick as you can. Let’s have
twenty,”
The beachcomber laughed. “You don’t know
much about Pingelap turtle if you think a canoe
would hold one. We’ve got ’em here five hundred-
lead)’ Y 0U ’ U haVe to send a boat. 111 So on

The mate went below to tell the skipper.

1 lie second mate and his crew followed the
whll e U A aU f nd , a crowd of natives to the pond
where the turtles were kept. It was merely a
huge pool m the reef, with a rough wall of coral
slabs built round to prevent the turtle escaping.
Add good idea—— ” commenced the second
mate, when there was a lightning rush of the
Drown-skmned men upon him and his crew. At
mocking a man down and tying him up securely,
your Caroline Islander is unmatched.
• * * * *
lt "P“ 8 rather sudden, isn’t it, Barton ? ”
I ne beachcomber was speaking to him, looking
into His eyes as he lay upon the ground. “You
don t remember my face, do you ? Perhaps my
back would improve your memory.”
a A cr ? s 8 the sullen features of the seaman there
flashed a quick light—the gleam of a memory.
But ms time was brief. The beachcomber whis-
pered to a native. A heavy stone was lashed to
the mate s chest. Then they dropped him over
the wall into the pond. The native sailors they
left where they lay.
And now ensued a hurried, whispered colloquy.
I he story of that day’s work is not yet forgotten
among the old hands of Poriape and Yap. .Suffice
it to say that by a cunningly-contrived device the
captain was led to believe that the second mate
and his crew had deserted, and sent the chief mate
and six native sailors to aid the natives in recap-
turing them. The presence of numbers of women
and children walking unconcernedly about the
beach made him assured that no treachery vVas in-
tended. The mate and his men were captured in
one of the houses, where they had been taken by
the beachcomber for a drink. They were seized
from behind and at once bound, but without any
unnecessarily rough usage.
“ What’s all this for?” said the mate uncon-
cernedly to the white man, He was an old hand
and thought it meant a heavy ransom—or death.
The beach-comber was standing outside in the
blazing sun, looking at tile ship. There were a
number of natives on board selling fish and young
cocoanuts. The women and children still saun-
tered to and fro on the beach. He entered the
house and answered the query.
“It means this—no harm to you and these six
men here if you lie quiet and wait till I send for
you to come aboard again. The other four men
are alive but tied up.”
“Ah,” said the mate, “ I see, you mean to cut
off the ship.”
“ No, I don’t. But I have an old debt to settle
with the skipper. Keep quiet or you’ll follow
Mister Barton. He’s dead. ”
Then the beachcomber, with some twenty natives,
went to where the first four men were lying and
carried them down into the mate’s boat.
» » * »
“Here’s the second mate’s chaps, sir,”
said the carpenter, “ the natives has ’em tied hand
and foot like pigs. But I don’t see Barton among
’em.”
“No,” said the captain, “ they wouldn’t tie up
a white man. He’ll come off with Willis and the
turtle. I never thought Barton would bolt.”
The ruse succeeded admirably. The boat-load
of natives had hardly been ten seconds on deck ere
the brigantine was captured. Watson, lashed in a
sitting position to the quarter railing, saw the last
man of the cutting-out party step on board, and a
deadly fear seized him. For that last man was
the beachcomber.
He walked aft and stood over him. “ Come on
board, Captain Thomas Watson,” he said, mock-
ingly saluting him. Then he stepped back and
surveyed his prisoner.
“ You look well, Watson. You know me now,
don’t you ? ”
The red, bloated face of the ski pper patched and
mottled and his breath came in quick, short gasps
of rage and terror.
“ Ah, of course you do ! Three years ago since
that Sunday at Vate when you had me triced up
and Barton peeled the hide off me in strips. You
said I’d never forget it and I’ve come to tell you
that you were right. I haven’t.
He stopped. His white teeth glistened beneath
the black-bearded lips in a low laugh, a laugh that
chilled the soul of his listener.
A light air rippled the water and tilled the sails,
and the brigantine moved. The man went to the
wheel and gave it a turn to port.
* * ♦ »
“Yes,” he resumed, casting his eye aloft,
“ I’m delighted to have a talk with you, Watson.
You will see that your crew are working the ship
for me. You don't mind, do you, eh ? And we
can talk a bit, can’t we, Watson ? ”
No answer came.
“None of the old hands left, I see, Watson—
except Barton. Do you know where he is now ?
No ? He’s dead. I hadn’t any particular grudge
against him. He was only your flogger. But I
killed him, and I’m going to kill you.” He
crossed his bare, sinewy arms on the wheel, and
smiled again at the bound and terrified wretch,
“You’ve had new bulwarks and spars since, I
see. Making money fast now, I suppose. I hope
your mate is a good navigator, Watson. He’s
going to take this ship to China.”
Then the fear-stricken man found his tongue,
and a wild, gasping appeal for mercy broke from
him.
“Don’t murder me, Hollis. I’ve been a bad
man all my life. For God’s sake, let me off ! I
Was a brute to you. I’ve got a wife and children.
For Christ’s sake *! ”
The man sprang from the wheel and kicked him
savagely in the mouth with his bare foot.
“Ha ! you done it now. ‘For Christ’s sake—
for Christ’s sake ! ’ Don’t you remember when I
used those words : ‘ For Christ’s sake, sir, hear
me ! I did not run away. I got lost coming from
the place where we were cutting the wood.’” A
flicker of foam fell on his tawny hand. “You
dog, you bloody-minded fiend ! For three years I
have waited .... and I have you now.”
A choking groan of agony came from Watson.
“Hollis! Spare me .... my children!”
The man had gone back to the wheel, calm
again. His seaman’s eye ran aloft, and the wheel
spun round. “Ready, about!” he called. The
brigantine went about and stood in again—to meet
the mate’s boat.
* * * *
“Come this way, Mr. Willis. Captain
Watson and I have been having a chat about old
times. You don’t know me, do you? Captain
Watson is a little upset just now, so I’ll tell you
who I am. My name is Hollis. I was one of the
hands of this ship. I am owner now. Funny,
isn’t it ? Now, now ; don’t get excited, Mr. Willis,
and look about you in that way. There isn’t a
ghost of a chance; I can tell you that. If you
made one step towards me, you and every man
Jack would have his throat cut. And as soon as
I have finished my business with our friend here
you’ll be captain—and owner, too, if you like.
By the bye, what’s the cargo worth ? ”
The mate told him.
* ♦ * *
“ Ah, quite a nice little sum—two thousand
pounds. Now, Mr. Willis, that will be practically
yours. With only one other white man on board,
you can take the vessel to Honolulu and sell both
her and the cargo, and no questions asked. Hard
on our friend here, though ; isn’t it ? ”
“ Good God, man, what are you going to do to
the captain—murder him ? ”
“ For God’s sake, Willis, help me ! ” The mute
agony in the skipper’s face, more than the spoken
words, moved even the rough and brutal nature of
the mate, and he opened his lips to speak.
“No ! ” hissed the man at the wheel; “ not to
save my soul from hell. Look at this ! ”
He tore off his canvas jumper, and presented
his scarred and hideous back to the mate.
“ Now, listen to me, Mr. Willis. Go below and
pass up as much tobacco and trade as will fill the
small boat. I don’t want plunder ; but these
natives of mine do.”
In a few minutes the goods were hoisted up and
lowered into the boat. The two six-pounders on
the main-deck were run overboard, and all the
small arms taken from the cabin by the natives.
“ Call your men aft,” the white man said to
Willis. They came along the deck and stood
behind him.
“ Carry that man on to the main hatch.”
Two of the strongest of the native sailors picked
up the burly figure of the captain and laid him on
the spot the beachcomber indicated, and cut his
bonds.
* * * *
A dead silence. The tall, sun-baked figure
of the sinewy beachcomber, naked save for his grass
girdle, seemed as he stood at the wheel, the only
animate thing on board. He raised his finger and
beckoned to a sailor to come and steer. Then
with quick strides he reached the hatch and stood
in front of his prey.
“ Captain Tom Watson. Look at me well ;
and see what you have made me. Your time
. . . and mine ... at last. ”
He extended his hand. A native placed in it
the hilt of a knife, short, broad-bladed, heavy, and
keen-edged.
“Hal Can’t you speak? Can’t you say ‘for
Christ’s sake ’ ? Don’t the words stick in your
throat ? ”
The sinewy left hand darted out and seized the
fated man by the hair, and then with a savage
backward jerk bent back his head and drew taut
the skin of the coarse, thick throat. There was a
flash of steel ....
* * * ♦
He wiped the knife on his girdle, and

looked in silence at the bubbling arterial stream
that poured down over the hatch-coamings.
“ You won’t forget my name, will you?” he said
to the mate. “Hollis; Hollis, of Sydney; they
know me there ; the man that was flogged at Yate
and left ashore to die at Santo.” _
He glanced down at the limp, huddled-up
mass at his feet, got into the boat, and with his
naked associates paddled ashore.
The breeze had freshened up, and as the brigan-
tine slowly sailed past the orowded native huts a
hundred yards distant, the mate saw him standing
by his thatched house watching.
A native girl came up to him with a wooden
water-bowl, and stood waiting. With his eyes
still fixed on the ship he thrust in his reddened
hands, moved them to and fro, then drawing them
out, raised them shoulder-high, dashed them down
again and went inside.

“ Princess ” Beatrice is to be elevated to
the peerage as Duchess of Kent. It may not be
generally known that it is “sheer vulgarity ” to
call the younger children of a British sovereign
“princes” and “princesses” until they are pre-
sumably raised to the peerage. They are “ com-
moners,” and, probably, in theory, could be pro-
ceeded against for using titles without proper
warrant,
‘ ‘ Fortunately, the ambitious and grasping
aims of millionaires do not rise above the disten-
sion of their money-bags. Napoleons, Washing-
tons, and Garibaldis, men who sWay the destinies
of mankind, are not found in the ranks of million-
aires,” moralises Melb, Age over the coffin of
Baron Hirsch ! The temperament of a Washing-
ton or a Garibaldi wouldn’t have allowed him to
preserve a lot of money, oven though gold had
dropped into his coffers from the clouds. A ttian
of noble aspirations can’t do the things necessary
to the amassing of an enormous fortune, or die
very rich if he inherits one—not unless the legacy
comes to him in his last moments. The suggestion
that a millionaire might become a, higher order of
being if he made an effort is irrational. How
high could his spirit soar under the weight of a
ton of bullion?
At Fremantle (W.A.) shipping affairs have
long been in a hopeless muddle. Steamers unload
at a jetty where they can find room— i.e. , they lie
at the jetty and wait for railway trucks. After a
time two or three trucks come along and, having
been loaded up, run their cargoes off the jetty and
dump them on a spot called “ the farm,” where
they lie in the sun and rain until the railway
department can carry them to their destination—
generally some weeks, or it may be months, later.
Recently timber ships have been making rafts of
their cargoes and landing them, on the beach.
There was much excitement recently when a
steamer arrived at the port with a 15-ton boiler for
a crushing works on board. It could not be
lightered, and all the govt, cranes at the jetty con-
fessed themselves unequal to lifting it. Finally
all the holes were plugged up and the boiler was
thrown overboard and anchored in the roads,
where it stayed for some days looking like an iron
whale. Occasionally a scare would be raised by
the report that it was sinking. But this did not
happen, the boiler being ultimately towed ashore
safely. Fremantle is a very good place for skip-
pers to stay away from.

Dear Bulletin,— Please note that Sydney Telegraph
which championed (1) the tramway grabsters and (2) the
North Shore-bridge grabsters, now champions (3) the
Wyalong grabsters. Whenever you see a slashing article
in the Telegraph wanting to sell the public some noble
reform cheap, ask the Telegraph “ Whv ? ” The Wyalorw
idea is obviously syndicate-snavelling and London flotation
on the basis of last year’s London returns. If the Wva
long mine-owners want that, let them have it. But do
they want it, or is the scheme only one in which two or
three owners and two or three broking-sharks are con
cerned? The system on which Wvalong has been
run has worked well, but it has always been
foreseen that the claims would have to be amalgamated as
shafts got deeper. Now that the Mines Dept, has decided
to permit amalgamation, there is nothing to prevent
claim-holders from joining their forces at once, employ-
ing the same amount of labor, and dividing the profits
among themselves as hitherto. But the D.T. clamors for
“ more area’’—why ? Because the London speculator is
used to tiie 25-acre or bigger Westralian leases, and it
isn’t much use trying him with 2 acres or 3 acres of Wva-
long ground, however rich, for the £lOO,OOO co which
the sharks are after. But 2 acres or 3 acres will pay the
present holders to work themselves, and keep the profits
on the field and in the country. The Mines Dept, deserve*
credit, not blame, for trying to shield the local working
miner from the big foreign syndicate.— Bed-Rock.
An Old-Time Horse-Soldiering
Case.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Brogg was making a forced journey from
Jindabo to Camptown—some 250 miles —in “ the
old days.” He relied on the “ horse-tailers -
whom everybody up to snuff patronised in those
times, or got their horses “ bushed ” if they didn’t
—“to provide him with a horse (“square” or
“cross”) at each stage en route, and an un-
doubtedly “square” horse for the final fly into
Camptown.
Camptown then consisted of one private build-
ing with pretentions to size—partly pub., partly
store, partly butcher’s shop, and partly black-
smith’s forge; a few humpies; also, a police-station
and court-house in one, and a police-paddock. A
Chinaman ran a market-garden some three miles
away. Camptown boasted a police magistrate,
who was several other official things as well, and
who lived at the pub. Most of the other residents
ate at the pub., too, but lived in tents, or slept
pillowed on their saddles in the open, save where
bark shelters had been erected. The pub. veran-
dah on a wet night was crowded, heads and legs,
with sleepers. Barring blacks, there were not
half-a-dozen women at Camptown.
At the 12-mile waterhole, Brogg got his last
horse from the tailers —a fine-shouldered grey. He
looked at the brands and at the moke.
“Say, is this O.K. ? Never saw him before.
Whose is he ? ”
“Dunno,” replied the tailers, “But it’s all
square. He comes from the other end, and ain’t
known here at all. ”
“The other end” meant nearly 200 miles the
other side of Jindabo, so Brogg mounted the grey
with an easy conscience, and cantered gaily into
Camptown early in the afternoon. He hung the
grey to a ring in the post in front of the pub, and
sang out for Billy, the groom and taker-down
generally.
Entering the pub., he encountered the police-
magistrate and the sergeant of police, hailed them
as old mates, and ordered drinks.
Suddenly there was a hubbub outside. The trio
went to see. Billy had the Chinese cabbage-man
by the back of the neck, and was threatening
awful things in lurid language. The Chinky was
holding on to the grey horse’s bridle.
“ Sahjint! Thatee my ho’se. Thatee been stole
sixee munse. Who bling him ? ”
Says Brogg : “ That’s my horse, you jumped-up
Chow-liar. ”
“ Sahjint! Me gotee leceet. You lookee blands.
All li ! Me givee this man in cha’ge.”
“By G — ! Brogg,” says the police-magistrate,
in an aside ; “ this is serious. Where did you get
the moke ? ”
“ Erom the (blanky) tailers. They said it was
from the other end. What’s to be done ? ”
“Hum ! If the Chow swears an informa-
tion, I’ll have to take notice of it. You’ll be
arrested. . . . Sergeant! Is the receipt all
right ? ”
“Eaith, Oi’m afraid it is, and the Chow wants
a warrant.”
A warrant was issued, Brogg was formally
arrested, and allowed out (on his own bail) tiil
next morning.
Then he and the P.M. and the sergeant and
Bailey (also a Government official in a minor way
—did I say Brogg was a Govt, official? no? well,
he was !) started to make a night of it —liquor,
cards, and dice.
The grey horse was placed in the police pad-
d °A vir, 4 U• u 4 + , , , ,
About midnight, there was a clatter of hoofs,
and up came Bandy, the mailman from Cow Flat
““fTt .... .
Late to-night, Bandy, said the police magis-
trae X , , . , , . ,
Yes, th orse is done up an’ how’m I goin’
ter start for Jindabo at birdcall? Once I get
ter the 12-mile, I know I can get put right by the
tailers. But how’m I ter get there? The ’orse
earn t crawl over bad ground. Ullo, Brogg,’ow’s
things?” T
Look here, said Brogg. “It s lucky I came
m to-day. Ive got to stop here for a week, at
least, and I can let you have my horse. He s fresh
and grass-proud. You can leave him with the
tailers at the 12-mile. I can easily get him again.
He’s a stunner. He’s in the police paddock,
hobbled; the only grey horse there. You can’t
mistake him. Call me at daylight, and I’ll point
him out to you. If we’re not still at it here, I’ll
be camped somewhere on the verandah.”
The police-magistrate, the sergeant, and Bailey
said not a word, but went on shaking the dice to
themselves,
Thanks, ’ said Bandy, “ ’ave a licker with me.
Stop, I’ll bring in a bottle,”
The night Was a phantasrnagorial one. The four
officials staggered to floor-camps just as Bandy
came to call Brogg.
Brogg pointed to the paddock : “See? That’s
the grey. Ride hell out of him if you like.”
Bandy went off, bridle on arm.
“ Brogg,” sung out the police-magistrate, raising
his head on one elbow, “call him back, and-
whisper !—tell him to (hie) leave the (jolly) slip-
rails down after him.”
Brogg did so. Bandy raised his eyebrow for a
second, and then replied—“ Right. / savee.”

The police-magistrate, the sergeant and the
prisoner strolled up to the court-hut together, after
having had at least one “Banana-man” apiece.
A Banana-man consisted of all the alcoholic
liquors under heaven mixed in a lemonade-tumbler
and livened up with a whisk; it contained also a
teaspoonful of tincture of cayenne, and was war-
ranted to make you comfortably drunk all day.
The Chinaman and Camptown’s one other con-
stable were already there. The sergeant was also
C.P.S., and had to take down the depositions. All

CURES
Indigestion, Sleeplessness, Loss of Strength and
Appetite, and Nervous Disorders.

The following letter from Mrs. S. Gash, of Kent Town, So. Australia,
whose portrait is given above, is additional testimony to the remarkable
health-giving power of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla:
“For two years or more I suffered considerably from indigestion,
sleeplessness, and loss of strength and appetite. When I did sleep I was
not refreshed, and I always had a severe headache in the morning. I was
induced to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla and was more than pleased at the
result, for after taking three bottles my complaints disappeared, and I
have been in the best of health ever since. I can strongly recommend
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to any one afflicted as I was.”
The wonderful success of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in purifying the blood and
restoring health and strength to systems enfeebled by disease, or the enervat-
ing effect of a warm climate, has led to the placing on the market of other
preparations called Sarsaparilla. Remember that imitation is the sincer-
est form of flattery, and be sure that you get AYER’S SARSAPARILLA
which has stood the test of time, has won the highest awards at the world’s
great expositions, and has been a blessing to the people of Australia, and
all civilized countries, for more than a generation. No other medicine operates
so effectually in removing general debility, languor, and all outward symp-
toms of the grave mischief caused by disordered nerves and impure blood.

Tbe NEW “LIP-FLAN<SE” FRUE VANNER BELT.
“ Will OOtlast Two of tfec Ordiijary.”
Genuine “ Frue ” Belts (obtainable only from
the patentees or their authorised agents) have, owing
to the great care and attention paid to their manu-
facture, invariably given good satisfaction, but, after
being in use a long time, the old flange had a ten-
dency to become weak and lose its vertical position.
This prevented the machine carrying the proper depth
of load, and allowed the sand to slop over and get
into the bearings. The new “ Lip-Flange,” which

has just been patented throughout the colonies, does
away with this difficulty almost entirely. It is
made of a very superior and elastic rubber prepared
in a special manner, and its peculiar shape prevents
it cracking in going over the rollers, or losing its
vertical position. All “ Frue Vanners ” sold in the
future will be fitted with this new “Lip-Flange”
Belt without additional charge, and the belts them-
selves may be procured from the patentees at a very
slight advance on the old price.
