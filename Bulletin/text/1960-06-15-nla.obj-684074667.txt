FIRST WORLD WAR
War-historian, military correspond-
ent to “The Times,” Chichele Professor
of the History of War at Oxford —
these are high qualifications for a
chronicler of War I. Add the facts that
Cyril Falls served as a junior infantry-
officer, and that he has spent twenty
years studying the various campaigns
at sea, on land and in the air, and you
might expect something out of the box.
In his The First World War (Long-
mans) you will find it. The book is
classic, with first-class photographs and
maps good enough for a staff-study.
The preface starts by exploding
various myths—underrating of Haig’s
generalship, due to “the myopia of the
English-speaking races” because of the
stagnation on the Western Front; the
fallacy that, because War II cost the
British less, casualties were generally
lower; the belief that in War I machine-
guns, not shells, were the biggest killers;
allegations that leadership in the first
war was mentally barren, and that the
Germans never recognised that they
were beaten.
In this preface Falls shows the effects
of the first war on France and the
growth of the Maginot mentality, “the
conception of ‘la guerre a la bourgeoise’
(a respectable, moderate sort of war)”
and the “wave of horror when the
spectre of another bloody war, neither
respectable nor moderate, loomed-up,”
after France’s toll in War I of over a
million dead.
The British soldier [writes Falls]
sometimes grumbled that, to judge
by Press reports, the 10 divisions of
Australians, Canadians and New
Zealanders did more fighting than
the 50 or so British. The Dominion
troops were extremely good, but it is
only fair to add that their countries
did not dig so deeply into their man-
power as the United Kingdom. As
a consequence their average physique
was better and they never filled their
ranks with youths Nor did they
follow the British example in
reducing divisions from 12 to nine
battalions.
The author describes the outbreak of
war from the time the British vice-
consul in Sarajevo sent his brief tele-
gram to the Foreign Office announcing
the death of the Archduke Francis
Ferdinand. He explains in detail the
first battles in France and Flanders and
the retreat of the B.E.F. from Mons
and pays this tribute to the Old Con-
temptibles’ musketry:—•
The Germans tried the standard
tactics: to build-up a strong firing-
line and then rush their enemy,
Instead, something they had never
dreamed of hit unit after unit. The
leading ones were shot to tatters.
The survivors could not understand
it. For long they believed they were
facing a “machine-gun army,” but
in fact the British had only two
machine-guns per battalion. It was
musketry, rapid fire such as no mass
conscript-army could produce. Let
a German tell the story: “The rushes
became shorter, and finally the whole
advance came to a stop.... With
bloody losses our attack came gradu-
ally to an end.”
About Gallipoli Falls sums-up:—
The fighting quality of both sides
was not of the ordinary, even if that
of the Allies, assailing a readily-
defensible objective in inferior num-
bers, must be accounted the higher.
Ordinary bravery withstands smash-
ing bombardments and will charge
under withering fire. To maintain
the ability to do this in the conditions
under which British, French, Aus-
tralians, New Zealanders, Indians,
Turks and a handful of Germans
lived on the Gallipoli peninsula is a
far different thing. Men who have
looked since at the tiny ledges, a few
yards away from Turkish trenches,
from which companies never moved
in daylight, have held their breath
and marvelled.
He explains the war at sea. in the
Turkish outer theatres and German
East Africa, the “hell at Verdun,” the
battles of attrition on the Somme, cam-
paigns in Russia and Italy and “how
they fared at home”: —
Increasing shabbiness was depres-
sing. ...In a few great cities, capitals
especially, a febrile gaiety appeared.
The night haunts gave the military
provost services much trouble and
even anxiety... .Even in London,
Paris, Berlin. Vienna and St. Peters-
burg the vast majority of the popu-
lation lived sober and rather dreary
lives, but a section, which included
many men in uniform, drank,
revelled, danced and wenched.
Of the Somme:—
As the Allied artillery lifted, the
stouthearted Germans ran up the
dugout steps and soon the rattle of
machine-guns was heard amid the
thunder of field- and heavy-artillery.
How well we got to know the sound
of that gun, a little slower than our
own and with, it always seemed, a
slight stutter in its burst of fire!
Into that storm marched the infantry
... .The sole success, and a fine one,
was on Gough's front, the capture of
Pozieres itself by the two Australian
divisions of the Anzac Corps....
which had only just arrived from
Egypt. Elsewhere it was all death,
taking, losing and retaking the rem-
nants of woods or pulverised
villages.
Macedonia and Egypt, the Caucasus,
Persia. Mesopotamia, entry of the
United States, spring battles of 1917,
Russian revolution, submarine-cam-
paign, Third Ypres, Cambria, the tanks
—war went on.
Turning to the outer theatres, “Bull”
Ailenby had now appeared in Palestine,
the wells at Beersheba were captured
by Harry Chauvel’s light-horsemen and
the British left wing started to fight its
way up the coastal “plain of the
Philistines.”

of 1918, war at sea in the air,

SKIN DIVER
Fisherman beware, the ocean cool
as morning music and as light as stars
hides other things than day and flatteries.
That is no welcome in the plunging pool
where you stand poised, there is no peace
at all
to fill you here, the water stretches far
past breathing in those shadows. Grasp
the air
you know that comforts and commends
your skill!
It is a strange necessity to dive
beyond the comfortable land, to seek
among strangers where your nakedness
is weak
and graceless. Well, go. What is it to live
and nothing taunts your nerves? Like
broken sound
the sun fails in those deeps that you have
found.

ONLY A QUARTER USED
VXfHILE the replanning of cities goes
’ ’ ahead and much thought is given
to the production of higher and higher
buildings and the engulfing of more and
more people into troglodyte living, the
expansion of population in rural areas
is not keeping pace.
Where there is increase outside
capitals it is mostly in big towns and
cities. It is the mechanical and mer-
chandising requirement rather than
production which now draws people
into the country. Mechanisation and
modern methods of transport tend
rather to reduce the actual farm popu-
lations.
And the fear of surplus keeps down
production except in one or two com-
modities such as wool and beef. The
need for huge infusions of capital and
fear of price-fluctuations and embar-
goes hold back the production of
profitable base metals.
At the same time there is no doubt
that a new interest is being awakened
in the outback areas which have little
population the huge arid dis-
tricts with anything from sin. to 20in.
rainfalls in The Centre, the north and
north-west of Queensland and the
north-east of Western Australia.
Until recently these have been diffi-
cult for investors to see and survey,
much less to assess. But the advent of
the light aircraft and the helicopter
have now made such work relatively
easy.
Unobtrusively, numerous parties have
been aerially wandering round Cape
York and the north of the continent in
general surveying, in astonishment,
pastoral and other possibilities, and
looking for the opportunities for which
overseas capital is certainly available
when the potentialities are properly
proved.
Some of those who have derived
wealth and surplus capital from city
investments are now turning to the
country under the inducements offered
through the increased demands of an
expanding world population. It is
becoming more and more difficult to
tell from the name of a limited com-
pany where its interests lie. Whale
Industries buy pastoral properties,
woolbrokers invest in stations, and
deals like the L. J. Hooker purchases
of the vast Buckland estates, between
them as large as Denmark, introduce
a new outlook.
There is no doubt but that these
areas are ripe for modernisation. Vic-
toria River Downs, for instance, has
scarcely been a station in the sense
in which the word is understood today
in the developed areas of N. S. Wales
and coastal Queensland.
It is a vast block of varied land,
capable of having conserved water in
most parts of it, watered by an excellent
rainfall, with well-sheltered fattening-
valleys.
A/fUCH of the blame for failure to
develop these districts, the Barkly
included, rests with Governments with
buttoned-up minds and Ministers like
George Pearce, who refused to give the
length of lease needed to enable large
capital to be employed because his
policies were inhibited by inborn fears
of “monopoly.”
If the small man could not expand
the industry of the area, let it remain
backward rather than risk losing votes
by incurring a charge of handing it
over to “monopoly”!
It is one of the most fortunate fea-
tures of the present age that Australia
has grown-up and is no longer afraid of
large capital, or set shivering by the
picture of Jewish ogres squeezing the
lifeblood out of the Australian toiler
through producing more exports and
making more employment.
Even the most rabid of Labor agita-
tors, who a generation ago could have
been counted on to use such horror-
pictures as his stock-in-trade, would not
dare to produce them to the sophisti-
cated TV-owners of 1960.
It is good to see city firms
extending their operations to the far
outback, prepared to spend money on
intensive improvement and communi-
cations, thoroughly encouraged by the
experience of those who have been
bold enough to venture already into
what used to be “the wilderness.”
When Mt. Isa was first opened it was
nothing more than a bold experiment.
Its resources had been known to men
like Cuthbert and others of their kind
for years. Valiant attempts had been
made to exploit the mineral resources
of the Cloncurry district, mainly in
copper, but the rich mineral ranges
along the Leichhardt seemed beyond
the resources, technical and financial, of
Australia to handle.
The Mt. Isa experiment is now
established as a prototype operation
for large-scale interior enterprises, its
housing, community amenities and
general setting living proofs that life in
the infertile inland tropics is not
necessarily hard and sub-standard, as
it has been on many large pastoral
properties;
'T'HE opportunity for multiplying
A enterprises like Mt. Isa is obviously
there, but it is somewhat discouraging
to find that the main prophets of it
lack the full co-operation of the Gov-
ernments which have so much to gain
from them.
G. B. Fisher, chairman of Mt. Isa
Mines, pointed out in a paper for the
National Export Convention that the
latest responsible forecast of needs for
copper, lead and zinc, prepared by
Jean Vuillequez, vice-president of
American Metal Climax, is that, from
a 1958 base, world-consumption by
1975 will increase 72 per cent, in
copper, 43 per cent, in lead and 82 per
cent, in zinc.
Mr. Fisher, combining these esti-
mates with the forecast for increased
possibilities of export of other metals
from Australia by J. A. Dunn, chief
economist to the Commonwealth
Bureau of Mineral Resources, declares
that the value of Australia’s mineral
exports, £69 million in 1959, should
be round at least £l4O million by
1975, even if they merely keep pace
with the world’s increasing consump-
tion. But he thinks that Australia’s
share should be greater, since it is
unlikely that all present producing
countries will be able to increase
production at the same rate as Aus-
tralia.
This statement seems to point to an
even greater and accelerating market
for Australian minerals beyond 1975,
just as its market for meat and wool
will also obviously increase and be
subjected each decade to less competi-
tion in relation to total world output
and markets.
It appears that the Government
should be extending to other industries
which will develop the tropic far-north
the same sort of measures and reliefs
that it extends to the search for oil.
Certainly mineral - prospecting for
vital technological metals should have*
more taxation-relief, and so should
investors prepared to develop large-
scale improved pastures and water-
facilities far from the coastline or the
great ports and fuel supplies, and house
their staffs and encourage workers
through wage-bonuses and provision on
amenities to leave the normal environ-
ment of coastal life.
The problem of the great unde-
veloped interior and North is still Aus-
tralia’s biggest and most urgent one.
Less than a quarter of Australia is &
present being developed.


THE TWO NOAHS


PLAIN ENGLISH
Stepping Softly
The A.L.P. conferences held over the
weekend showed the creaky condition of
the “LaboV” party, as it is still called, but
which it isn’t. _ x
Everybody, including even F. H.
Campbell, president of the N.S.W. State
Executive, and Arthur Calwell, seemed
afraid to speak above a whisper lest the
political ceiling be brought down. The
Communists and agents of Communists
who seed these gatherings from door to
platform, making the meetings the
largest examples of unity-ticket meetings
extant, all tried to look like good Liberals,
even in some cases voting against their
own supporters to give color to the
illusion that these were sound Australian
gatherings that had never heard of the
Kremlin.
However, the usual Red haze hung like
a gas-curtain in the air. Mr. Campbell,
in Sydney, roundly advised Labor to
avoid “extremism.” He attacked the Com-
munist party tooth-and-nail as “anti-
Labor” and chided unions affiliated with
the A.L.P. which contributed to Com-
munist funds —surely a piece of unfiy-
ticket operation which calls for the
expulsion of the unions concerned
under A.L.P. rules.
He declared solemnly that these con-
tributions from union funds were made
against the opinion of the rank-and-file,
and that no union member wanted to see
his funds “squandered,” but they were
squandered on such parties as the Com-
munist party.
Then he plunged into paradox. It was
quite obvious that the unions doing these
things are at the mercy of the members
of the Communist party that lead them ;
but they still can be affiliated with the
A.L.P., it seems.
It is also quite obvious that the A.L.P.
leaders know it and that they know (as
Mr. Campbell said) that “a lesson to be
learned from the experiences of recent
years is that the Australian people will
only support Labor if it remains true
to character. Every time it has become
extreme it has been rejected.”
Yet at the same time he chided the
Australian people and the Groupers and
others who opposed Dr. Evatt and failed
to make him Prime Minister because of
his associations, as a politician and a
barrister, with Communists.
Premier Heffron spoke as if the
conditions of full employment, with
an “average wage of £2O for a
40-hour working., week,” were the
private perquisite of workers in
N.S.W., but he spoke softly lest firemen
and others shouting ferociously against
courts that won’t give them more margins
should be attracted to his noise.
In Melbourne, the vice-president of the
A.L.P., Mr. Brebner, was put up to make
"an unscheduled denial of the charges
that the Communists had realised their
anxiously-awaited tactical control of
yictorian electric power through unity-
tickets at ihe election of the Gippsland
Trades and Labor Council. The impres-
sion given off by the conference was that
Victorian Labor, which is the most
extreme in the Commonwealth, was a
even more mildly moderate than the
N.S.W. branch ; but great care was taken
to direct the main attack not against the
Communists but against the D.L.P., which
was represented as a vrcious lie-factory.
All State conferences are held finger-
on-lip in the shadow of the Bendigo and
Balaclava elections.
It, of course, remained for Arthur
Calwell to provide the comic interlude.
With eyes to the ceiling, looking as if he
weie hypnotised by his iridescent halo,
he declared solemnly that Labor’s
Socialist objectives had stood the test of
40 years and Labor would never abandon
them.
From the time the Communist party
was formed, he said, A.L.P. conferences
had reaffirmed that there was an unbridg-
able gap between the Labor party and
the Communist party, despite the per-
suasions of wicked men that they should
go over to Communism.
Nobody smiled. There was not even a
sad grin when Dr. Evatt’s successor
announced that Labor would win the
next Federal election. Most A.L.P.
leaders are not thinking beyond the end
of July and the Bendigo poll and the
excommunication of fellow-travellers by
Archbishop Mannix and Bishop Fox.
Two Sydney Strikes
As a rule there’s not much in common
between the job of a fireman and that
of a milkman, but for a short time last
week the work of Sydney’s firemen and
milk-carters might just have well been
identical because they weren’t doing it,
anyway. Both groups were expressing
their disapproval of court awards by
taking it out on the general public.
The firemen’s dispute had been simmer-
ing for a month, with the firemen report-
ing for work each day, obeying calls to
fires but refusing other duties at the
stations, the object being to force
margins-claims higher than the court had
awarded. On Wednesday, after the
suspension of two junior officers for
refusing to direct cleaning-up work, a
general strike of all firemen was called,
and Sydney and several big country
centres were left without a fire-fighting
force except for senior executive-officers.
The milk-workers’ strike was a week-
long affair in protest against an award of
the N.S.W. industrial Court which didn’t
give them as big a pay-increase as they
asked for. As a result, Sydney’s milk-
supply was cut to about two-fifihs of
normal, causing real hardship in many
homes.
Both strikes collapsed when the shadow
of deregistration loomed up in front of
the unions concerned, but not before
both had given evidence of the extra-
ordinary mental outlook of some trade-
union officials. W. Stolmack, the repre-
sentative of the Firemen’s Union on the
Board of Fire Commissioners, described
as “very provocative” the board’s action
in ordering the two officers to do work
the union had told them not to do. This
action, he said, “had denied full fire-
protection to the citizens of Sydney.” On
this interpretation of responsibility the
Board of Fire Commissioners might as
well not exist, since it is apparently
expected to take its orders from the
Firemen’s Union.
On the milk front Albert Thompson,
secretary of the Milk and Ice Carters’
Union, adopted a similar attitude. He
was horrified to think that J. A. Ferguson,
chairman of the Milk Board, should con-
template taking action against the union
because of the strike. After all, hadn’t
Ferguson been a trade-union leader-him-
self before his appointment to the Milk
Board job? And wasn't it a Labor
Government that gave him the job?
McArthur to the Rescue !
Sir Gordon McArthur, president
of the Victorian Legislative Council, came
to the rescue of the Government to save
the modest liquor-reform bill after the
Labor and Country parties had indulged
in some shoddy electioneering for the
benefit of the wowsers. He was the first
president for 17 years to vote from the
floor of the House.
It was no surprise to old hands in
Spring Street that McArthur should
eventually come to the Government’s aid.
He is the educated, travelled and liberal
politician to whom the civilising influence
of the Government’s small measure of
reform, related chiefly to providing drink
with food and at genuine clubs, would
prove irresistible.
The capers to which the Opposition
parties in the Council resorted, necessi-
tating additional days of sittings by both
Houses, are unlikely to have endeared
them to electors, since the latest Gallup-
poll shows that the thraldom in which
the drink harks have held Victoria has
been broken.
The excuses for attempting to throw >
out the bill—that it was being rushed
and that it had no mandate —were so
trifling and untrue that it is probable the
Government’s reputation has been
enhanced in the electorate.
Heffron and East-West *
[From Canberra]
N.S.W. Premier Heffron received his
greatest share of bouquets yet from
Canberra following his adroit move
last month to stop Reg. Ansett taking
over East-West Airlines. \
The Federal Labor boys were jubilant f
at his move—which succeeded —while f
at the same time a number of Govern- j
ment supporters covertly admitted that
for once they were glad to see Ansett
have his wings, clipped.
While Ansett talks blithely about his i
company saving Australia from a Govern- V
ment-monopoly airline, his acquisition
of East-West would have resulted in an j
Ansett monopoly throughout N.S.W.
Although there was no guarantee that
Heffron’s offer to grant East-West additi-
tional franchises would prevent a take-
over, it did, in fact, help to do just that.
With a strong recommendation from
the directors, a 75 per cent, vote of


shareholders resulted in just under 100
per cent, of that number voting to keep
Ansett on the outside.
Among many who were pleased at the
result was none other than Civil Aviation
Minister Shane Paltridge himself. He
has been a very loyal supporter of Ansett,
claiming that he was getting no better
treatment than T.A.A. —and no worse.
However, antagonism has been grow-
ing towards Ansett over recent months,
and Paltridge was having a hard time
convincing many of the Government’s
own supporters than Ansett was not
being pampered.
A successful bid for East-West, to
give Ansett a virtual intra-State mono-
poly within N.S.W., would have hardened
much of the criticism against him and
'made Paltridge’s job so much more
difficult.
A lot of people were unhappy at the
way Ansett swallowed-up Butler's, and
didn’t want to see the same thing happen
to East-West, which has expanded from
a very small outfit to a first-class airline,
filling a large want in the outback districts
of N.S.W.
A Middle East Policy?
[From “Stromlo”]
Has Australia a Middle East policy on
such matters as the use and abuse of the
Suez Canal and relations between Israel
and the United Arab Republic? And,
if so, is that policy a “soft” one towards
Egypt, following the re-establishment of
our Legation in Cairo? It would be
interesting to have such a policy (if
any) defined, especially as Nasser is
making no move, apparently, to send a
reciprocal diplomat here.
There are curious factors in the situa-
tion, which is somewhat complicated
by the curious friendship between Nasser
and Nehru which received so much
publicity in India, and so little elsewhere,
during Nasser’s March-April visit to
India. Nasser remarked during it that
his country and India had come closer
together and were now marching together
“towards common objectives and a
common future,” a remark that warrants
some fuller explanation. Nasser is still
defying the United Nations, still block-
ing the free passage of ships through the
Canal, and still well in cahoots with the
Russians, while playing the West for as
much as he thinks he can squeeze out
of them. A re we playing along? And
why are the Indians doing so?
Two matters which cause doubts are
whether Australia will agree that the
World Health Organisation should have
official dealings with the Arab League
as such, and what, if anything, is being
done about help for Egypt in a grandiose
Western Desert scheme, the New Valley
project.
This latter subject arose unexpectedly
in Federal Parliament during the last
session when Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes
(who attracts international attention, at
least, because he’s chairman of the
Foreign Affairs Committee) asked the
Prime Minister whether he didn’t think
the expenditure by Australia in the provi-
sion of a team of experts and a boring-
plant would pay “high dividends in
international goodwill.” Mr. Menzies said
he hadn’t heard of the scheme, but he’d
look into it along the lines suggested—a
reply that caused misgivings in those
circles which continue to doubt any
possibility of Egyptian goodwill at any
price.
At any rate, in view of Menzies’
unchanged views on the Suez incident
it seems unlikely that he is yet prepared
to become really friendly with Nasser and
his mob.
Policemen as Judges
Pressing ahead with another of its
inroads on civil liberties, the Bolte
Government has successfully launched
its Cop-the-Keys Bill under which a
policeman—any policeman —can take the
keys of a car in charge of a motorist
whom he suspects is under the influence
of alcohol.
The only member of either House who
made a determined fight against this
latest invitation to official impertinence
was John Galbally, the Labor leader
in the Legislative Council, a noted
barrister who was heckled by Govern-
ment members with assertions that the
Victorian police-force was just on
perfect.
Criminal charges against members of
the Victorian Police Force are not fre-
quent but hardly uncommon ; as highly
placed officers point out, any large
body of men must contain “a percentage
of mongrels.” This latest power is con-
ferred equally on the uniformed just and
the uniformed mongrels.
The Chief Secretary who introduced the
bill has now gone overseas for a law
convention. He has been in recent years
too easy a mark for bureaucratic recom-
mendations, but in Britain he may
note the passionate devotion to civil
liberties, of which there was a recent
reminder in the case of a highly-
placed lady charged with driving under
the influence.
“You don’t have to accept police evi-
dence,” said the judge to the jury. “If
you did, that would be tantamount to
trial by the police-force.” A few minutes

Japanese and Their Ways
Reading the news from Japan, a
Western reader might believe that the
whole of unionism was in revolt against
the Security Treaty with the United States.
It might be believed that Japan was
swinging with its Socialists towards
Communism and association with Red
China, and that Western contacts were
doomed. It might be deduced that
Japan no longer placed any value on
the West as a source of supply for the
raw materials which are the lifeblood
of its industries, such as wool, and that
it was prepared to abandon its great
markets in the high-priced West (its
salvation) under a delusion that it can
secure the same advantages from the
exchange-poor Red East.
It might also be thought that President
Eisenhower would have a torrid time
in Japan. But all that is being exposed
to the world is a fine display of the
agglutinative Japanese mind.
The strangest feature about the
Japanese, to a Westerner, is something
that is born of the fact that they are
the longest-organised and most closely-
regimented people in the world.
In whatever stratum or section of
life a Japanese exists, everybody turns
over together, great and small. If there
is a harvest to be got in everybody takes
part —big men and little men, big women
and little women, adolescents and
nippers all have their heads down in the
ricefield.
If there is a problem to be thought-
out —where is a number in a street;
what is the way to the nearest honky-
tonk ; does the gentleman want to go
to the Yoshiwara or to the United States
Embassy?—everybody within hearing
joins in. Does somebody get drunk on
Chrysanthemum Day, everybody sets out
to help the drunk (who is the most
boneless of his kind in the world) and
tries to look as drunk as he is.
Does somebody scream in the Diet,
everybody screams. The result to the
outsider is an impression that no single
Japanese is ever capable of thinking
alone. Thinking is done by the collec-
tive mind of everybody present. Rioting
is merely something which everybody
in sight is bound to join in even if he
does not know what it is all about and
doesn’t care. The basic habit of the
Japanese for 2600 years has been to
acquiesce rather than to question, and
the acquiescence becomes louder in
proportion to the loudness of the manner
in which the proposition is put.
This characteristic has worried the
modern Japanese themselves for a long
time. Years ago a Japanese newspaper
in a leading article remarked that what
is “termed ‘why’ in English and ‘naze’
in our language is a very important
thing. Nevertheless the Chinese and
Japanese of the old regime -hardly ever
used the word. When told that such
and such was the doctrine. .. .they
habitually agreed without further inquiry
into the rights of the question.... But
Europeans are apt to assert the import-
ance of doubt and its services to the
cause of civilisation, and to prove their
assertion by pointing to the Chinese and
Japanese as forever unprogressive, owing
to their neglect to subject all things to
the scrutiny of doubt.”
The modern Japanese has not changed
much.
However, the habit of joining-in cuts
both ways. The same crowd that on
Tuesday howls in unison with the Com-
rade who advances the doctrine that
Eisenhower is a plague of mankind can
on Wednesday riot just as enthusiasti-
cally to support the asserted doctrine
that he is the savior of mankind.
Whether the freedom of thought intro-
duced by, and vaunted by, the Americans
during the Occupation has changed the
nature of the Nipponese remains to be
seen. If it has, the Americans are, as
so often, hoist on their own petard.

“Irving”: Queensland Premier, the late
W. Forgan Smith, was persona non grata
with public servants, who considered that
he had unjustly slashed their salaries; one
of them, golfing in the rough, came across
a stray ball conspicuously branded with
the name of the canny Scots Premier.
The public servant, after a quick look
around, drove the stray pill high, wide,
handsomely and vindictively into the tall
timber. I made a “Smith’s Weekly” par.
of the incident, with, of course, the
anonymity of the vengeful one carefully
preserved. “Smiths” illustrated the par.
and, by a freak of fate, the caricature was
a speaking-likeness of the villain; he went
for weeks in fear and trembling of reper-
cussions from the often-ruthless Forgan.
Not until the dread shadow had passed
did he speak to me, and our relations are
not cordial, even after 30 years.

“Wynbal”: Those cobbers’ comment
at “Bo’s” wedding (B. 18/5/’6O) were
mild diversions in comparison with the
stunt put on by staff members at an
Army convalescent-depot in 1944, when
one of their number was talcing the last
grim walk at a nearby church. When
the celebrant issued the ritual invitation
to all and sundry to voice any known
impediments to the marriage, the bride-
groom’s mates, to a man, rose from their
seats. Then, after an awful half-minute
during which celebrant, contracting-
parties and the rest of the congregation
stared aghast, the jokers, one by one,
slowly resumed their seats. I wonder if
any officiating-clergyman alive today has
ever been taken-up on the invitation?
And if the invitation were accepted, what
would be the celebrant’s position?

when, as a junior with Charles Trocdel,
the theatrical printer (copy for 12-sheeters
and four-color daybills on Monday for
delivery Friday), my job was to attend
the weekly ghost-walk at the old Her
Majesty’s (Melbourne). Collectors
queued in the stage-door passage and
filed into the office of E. J. Tait, seated
behind a huge table with a pyramid of
sovs. in the centre, flanked by smaller
piles of halves and silver. A quick re-
ceipting of the account, and exit into
grubby old Exhibition Street with both
side-pockets of one’s pants bulging with
golden quids—anything from £lOO to
£2OO. Surprisingly, the saunter back to
the office via Exhibition Street, the
Eastern Market, and sundry lanes and
short-cuts never involved a bashing Or a
holdup ; there were fewer bad men about
in those days. Like “Henri Marq,” I got
a lot of satisfaction in the recounting
under the gloating eyes of the rest of the
office staff.

CRITICS
“The Australian Broadcasting Commission
was concerned about ‘ill-informed and
unwarranted’ music criticism, said the general-
manager, Mr. Charles Moses. French con-
ductor Georges Tzipine had said he was
outraged by criticism of a concert he conducted
with the Victorian Symphony Orchestra.”
I think it better not to see
A poem lovely as a tree
Since, if / did, the odds would be
That no one would agree with me.
There would be Letters to the Press
And “Nature-lover Claims Redress”;
Attacks with motives not so pure
Would go through like a Bondi sewer.
Actors, musicians, painters rise
And curse the critics they despise:
“You've soured our audience!” they say ;
Then : “No one reads you, anyway !”
I often wish this last were true,
But that is what the people do:
Instead of using their own minds
They parrot what the critic finds.
And so I think I should not see
A poem lovely as a tree
Since, if / do, the odds will be
That people will agree with me.

18/5/’6O) on straw deckers, the
G.P.S. kids north of 28° are not as good
as they used to be. At my boarders-only
G.P.S. straw boaters were compulsory.
They cost Bs. 6d. After Old Chimp had
doled us out 6d. pocket-money for a day’s
leave in town we promptly drew a new
straw lid on the old man’s account, and
equally promptly popped it for 2s. 6d.
on reaching town. Half-a-dollar gave us
a good day out in those times. Walking
up to Central to catch the enjoined home-
train we had to pass Rowe’s Lane, in
which a flourishing two-up school held
its seminars. Knowing that the two-up
scholars were not partial to G.P.S. boys,
we tactfully hid our straw lids under our
jackets while we negotiated the lane. The
cold war was ended by five new brothers
from the Northern Rivers of N.S.W.
Nobody had told them about the
gentlemen of Rowe’s Lane, through which
they strode wearing the straw deckers.
A two-up scholar spat on the boater of
the eldest brother; he, with his four
brothers, in their ignorance of protocol,
swept with flailing fists into the lane, and
about 150 hitherto-gentlemanly G.P.S.
youths followed them into the melee,
which disturbed more than somewhat the
curriculum of the two-up school. Thence-
forth we passed the lane without inter-
ference, but, by gentleman’s agreement,
we didn’t flaunt our straw deckers. I’m
sorry to hear that Brisbane G.P.S. boys
are doing it now. There were plenty of
good blokes in Rowe’s Lane. —“Seps.”

as he roared through a mouthful of
foreign fangs, “These aren’t my b

them out to sea. At this unforeseen

Australian magazines are still succeeding
in battling the TV away from the door;
some of the women’s papers are still sur-
viving, and The Bully, thank heaven,

AMBRPSE
By
R. S. PORTEOUS
Ambrose was admitted to
the hospital one bitterly
cold night in June. For
five days and nights he
had been trying unobtrusively
and unsuccessfully to gain
admission, and finally the
night-Sister in Ward Three
felented, admitted him, shared
her midnight meal with him
and moved her radiator so
that he could share its warmth.
He had worn her down, she
informed the day staff when
she handed over next morning,
worn her down with his quiet,
undemanding persistence.
Ambrose was that sort of
cat.
He didn’t demand to be
let in, didn’t slink past you and
try to establish himself when
you weren't looking, but
simply waited patiently for
recognition. And having gained
that recognition he didn’t
presume on it by getting
under-foot or begging for food,
although he must have been
starving when Sister Sharon
admitted him. Sharon was
the night-Sister and it was she
who christened him Ambrose.
Why, nobody knew. If
Sharon had once had a boy-
friend named Ambrose she
wasn’t admitting it.
Ambrose wasn't a handsome
cat. He was a plain black
cat without a single relieving
touch of white. He was thin
and rather scruffy. In fact he
was the typical stray cat that
tempts the average person to
reach for something throw-
able and yell “Scat!” But he
had charming manners.
Perhaps he realised that per-
sonality can make-up for lack
of good looks.
' The day staff, without
actually accepting him at first,
tolerated him as Sharon’s cat,
and Ambrose made no effort
to ingratiate himself with
them. His self-effacing tactics
paid dividends. The Sister-in-
charge gave him some lunch-
scraps because she thought he
looked undernourished, and
the junior nurse fed him
because he had such nice
manners. In one way and
another Ambrose was doing
all right for himself.
By the end of the week he
was no longer referred to as
Sharon’s cat; he was Ambrose,
Ward Three’s cat. The day
staff even forgot it was Sharon
who had admitted and named
him.
But Ambrose never forgot.
He was there, beside the
Sister’s desk, waiting to greet
her when she came on duty
each night, and having greeted
her and been stroked he settled
down at her feet. When she
picked up her torch and went
to make her round of the
ward he followed her like a
well-trained dog.
Although Sharon was his
favorite he obviously loved
human company. A passing
“Hello, Ambrose,” and a
caressing hand along his back
would bring a satisfied smirk
to his face and start him
purring, like an electric-razor.
Ward Three was Men’s
Surgical, and Ambrose soon
became popular with the
patients. Not that he ever
lingered in the ward or
accepted any of the numerous
invitations to jump-up on a
bed. He was far too well-
mannered for that, or else he
was shrewd enough to realise
that any infringement of the
strict hospital routine would
mean banishment for him.
He merely walked through the
ward and found a nice sunny
corner on the veranda where
the walking-patients could
stroke him, feed him with odd
scraps and do their bes_t to
spoil him.
r T' I HE only person who didn’t
fall for Ambrose was old
Mick Regan, the odd-job
man about the hospital. But
then Mick hated all cats. In
fact, it would have been diffi-
cult to find anything or any-
one he didn’t hate. Years of
taking orders from what he
described as “a pack o’ inter-
ferin’ flamin’ wimmen” had
aged and soured him until
he looked 10 or 15 years older
than his 53 years.
He was a gnarled little
Irishman with lines of dis-
content etched deeply into his
face. He was fanatically
superstitious and he was an
expert work-dodger.
He first caught sight of
Ambrose when he was sweep-
ing the veranda one morning.
“Scat!” he yelled, display-
ing a most unusual burst of
energy by charging forward
with upraised broom. “Scat,
you black divil! ”
’ Taken by surprise, Ambrose
scatted. He shot through the
ward and took refuge in the
Sisters’ office, and the junior
nurse who was folding blankets
with the help of two walking-
patients said, “Mick! You
nasty old man! You leave
Ambrose alone.”
“Lissen,” Mick snarled, “I
don’t have to take no orders
from the likes o’ you.”
Evidently the Sister-in-charge
had also seen the attack,
because she stepped out onto
the veranda and said with the
cold voice of authority, “Mick,
you will kindly leave that cat
alone in future. He belongs
here.”
Mick turned his back and
went on with his sweeping.
“Wimmin!” he muttered, tak-
ing a reckless swipe at a stray
leaf. “Wimmin and cats!
One o’ thirn’s as bad as the
other.” ' x
He finished the veranda in
record time, but his burst of
energy did him no good. The
Sister-in-charge was waiting
for him. She had a job for
him, several jobs in fact. In
one way and another Mick had
a busy morning without a
single opportunity to slip into
the patients’ lavatory, his
favorite hiding-place.
He never forgave Ambrose
for that morning, never started
sweeping the veranda without
first locating the cat and then
peering around to see what
chance he had of attacking
him without being seen. The
chance never came;"Ambrose
was far too shrewd for that.
He might be sleeping peace-
fully in his sunny corner, but
immediately Mick appeared
he would wake-up, stretch him-
self and decide what course
of action the situation called
for. If he had bolted for
cover he might at least have

Muller from his old job of Minister for
Lands and Irrigation to another port-
folio. After consideration Muller told
the Premier he did not feel inclined to
take-on a new department and tendered
his resignation.
Minor changes in portfolios are:
Education Minister Pizzey will also be
Minister for Migration; Ernest Evans
will add Electricity to his Development,
Mines and Main Roads departments;
Minister for Agriculture Madsen will
also be Minister for Forestry. Until a
successor to Muller is chosen this week
Madsen will also administer Public Lands
and Irrigation*
A. G. Muller has represented Fassifern
in the Queensland Assembly for 25 years.
As Minister for Lands he was responsible
last year for introducing the new Lands
Act, which is expected to bring new life
to rural development in Queensland. He
is 71.

July 16, already fixed as polling-day
for the Bendigo by-electiori, will also
be the day of the poll in Balaclava,
vacant through the elevation of Percy
Joske to the Commonwealth Industrial
Court bench. By-elections have become
the traditional way of winning the Bala-
clava seat. Tommy White won it that
way in 1929 after the death of W. A.
Watt, its occupant since 1914. White
held it for 22 years and resigned in
1951 on his appointment as High Com-
missioner in London. That’s when
Joske took over.
From last week’s world’s industrial
news: Surprise strikes, organised by the
Communist - dominated Confederation
General du Travail, disrupted railway-
travel throughout France; protest
strike against U.S. Security treaty
by s|-million Japanese workers under
the influence of Communist leader-
ship ; strike of 1500 Qantas employees
in five unions mostly under Com-
munist influence or domination,
though the main cause of the dispute,
nightshifts, did not directly affect more
than a seventh of the total; milk strike in
Sydney; firemen’s strike in Sydney;
strikes in various Australian ports, some
of them accompanied by rowdyism,
violence, threats and contempt of court,
by seamen, ship-painters and dockers and
watersiders; strikes on the Queensland
and Victorian railways—and every one of
them with Communists in the back-
ground.

T}ver the optimist, Calwell is predicting
that Labor will win Bendigo by 3000
votes. That, presumably, is a rough esti-
mate, give or take 4000.
“After all that, who said ‘How about a drink?’”
Calwell says the enemy of Labor
h the Communist party, separated from
the true-blues by an “unbridgeable gap.”
But in Victoria McNolty insists that the
real enemy is the D.L.P. Victorian A.L.P.
has re-elected its Left-wing executive ; in
N. S. Wales the Right-wing retains con-
trol. Calwell expects to win the next
Federal election, basing his prophecy
largely on the swing of Q.L.P. votes to
Labor in Queensland. There may be
unity-tickets in the Labor party, but obvi-
ously N. S. Wales and Victorian branches
aren’t running one.

Factory employment in Australia
increased by 43,200 in the 12 months to
the end of March, 1960, according to
figures issued by Commonwealth
Statistician Carver. At that date the
total number of employees in manu-
facturing industry was 1,173,300, and the
total number of all wage- and salary-
earners (excluding rural industry and
female domestics) 3,073,800 —an increase
for the year of 88,100. After manufactur-
ing, commerce showed the biggest gain
—14,400, to which the retail trade con-
tributed 8200 and the wholesale 5300 —
and property and finance 8300.

The N.S.W. Hotels Association is
protesting against a move to establish a
licensed A.L.P. club in ' Newcastle.
They’re afraid the idea will spread until
the State is dotted with Labor clubs
infested with poker-machines. Alderman
Sam Jones, one of the sponsors of the
proposed club, says the association is
“scared of a shadow.” The purpose of
the club, he says, is to provide a meeting-
place for A.L.P. members and their
families, and to promote “social and cul-
tural activities for the children of its
members.” He hasn’t explained whether
the amenities include tipples for toddlers
and penny poker-machines.

Soekarno arrived home last week
behind a flood of press-cuttings depicting
him kissing pretty infidels which were
scarcely palatable to his largely
Mohammedan population. Rumors,
however, that the Army had deposed him
proved wishful thinking. The Indonesian
defence forces were too busy trying to
frighten the Dutch to worry about their
local vassals. Later, things may be dif-
ferent—if they can find anybody other
than a Communist to play puppet-
dictator.

In Perth Gough Whitlam, Calwell’s
deputy, had a crack at Dalziel and then
went-on to predict that Labor would
win four W.A. seats in the next Federal
poll. This forecast, in the face of the
bitter struggle now in progress for pre-
selection for the one W.A. seat Labor
now holds in the Reps, was completely
fanciful. The ballot for Fremantle will
close on June 30. Sitting member Kim
Beazley, a Moral Rearmer, who suc-
ceeded Curtin in 1945 (Norman Makin
predicting in a tearful tone that he’d
prove another Curtin), has a lot of
critics in caucus, but he survived a strong
preselection challenge by watersider G.
W. Harris in 1954 and 1958. Now the
politically-conscious Rev. Keith Dowd-
ing, formerly of Sydney, is the contes-
tant, and will have a lot of support in the
intense atmosphere which has followed
Labor uproar in the West and the wreck-
ing of the Transport Workers’ Union.
Chided by the Melbourne press after
the Queensland elections for Labor’s
failure to close its ranks and form an
effective Opposition in both Federal and
State Parliaments, Jack Tripovitch, Vic-
torian A.L.P. secretary, retorted that any
comment about unity within the Labor
movement was pushing the viewpoint of
people who were opposed to Labor.
The mere mention of unity, with its
tender association with union elections,
makes the Victorian A.L.P. executives
see Red.

“Collins Street”: Premier Bolte, given
a fifth-anniversary dinner by 400 well-
heeled (£6 a seat) citizens, told three
stories against himself.
He said he had complained during a
game of golf that it was a bit of a dis-
grace that no Liberal had nominated for
Hampden, and next thing he found him-
self electioneering ; he went campaigning
in an old truck with his wife, and a young
lad told him his parents were out and
there were no bottles to give away ; and
when he was elected no one had any
qualms in referring to him as a stop-gap
leader good enough to hold the fort until
some worthwhile fellow came along.
"Still, Menzies lived-down “Pig Iron
Bob,” and Bolte, no doubt, will live-
down Bottle-0 —especially if he shouts
himself a new hat occasionally.

On June 6 125 Socialists resigned from
the Japanese Diet as a protest against
the security treaty with the United States ;
on the same day si-million steelworkers
staged a protest-strike. Mainly this
hysteria is whipped-up by Communists,
and it shows suicidal tendencies. With
no defence of its own Japan must depend
either on the good faith of the Red
Chinese and Russians or that of the
Western Powers. History should have
taught by this time which of the two
can best be relied-on.
A lthough Heffron and Local Govern-
ment Minister Hills deny that the

Foster of Sydney City Council, who,
discussing the future of the Queen
Victoria Market building, said, “After
January, 1961, we will be employing
additional staff because of amalgama-
tions.” It is not enough for Heffron
and Hills to dismiss inquiries with an
airy -know-nothing disclaimer. They
should ask the City Council by what
authority aldermen are making these
statements.

British dramatic critics have praised
John Trenaman’s performance in a sup-
porting role to Sir Alec Guiness at
London’s Haymarket Theatre. Trenaman
first faced the footlights in his native
Perth and then had experience in Canada,
followed by a course at the London
Academy of Music and Dramatic Art.
Organising an Australia-wide door-
knocking campaign to raise funds for
world refugees, with all the knocking to
be done in one day, calls for a capable
organiser. Hence the appointment by
the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees of one of his senior officers,
Alexander Mclver, as his representative
in Australia.
In the past six months Mclver, an
American, has travelled 100,000 miles
around Australia and New Zealand pre-
APPEAL ORGANISER
paring voluntary bodies for this mam-
moth task. They will aim at a minimum
of 2s. a head—and the date is June 19.
Here pictured, Mclver is a graduate
of the University of Montana and before
the war was working in the Far East.
He was managing-director of R.K.O.
Films on the outbreak and accepted a
commission in the British Army until
he could join-up with the American
forces. Being captured and sent to
Changi p.-0.-w. camp altered that, and
it was while there he heard, on the secret
radio, of the formation of the United
Nations and decided to offer his services
to it on liberation. From 1946 to 1949
he was executive-officer and deputy-chief
of the office of U.N.R.A.A. Far Eastern
Affairs; he then moved to the U.N.
Mission for Kashmir, served later with
U.N.1.C.E.F., and in 1952 made an
official visit to Australia on its behalf.
He has many other contacts with Aus-
tralia, among them lots of friends met
in Changi as members of the Eighth

“C. Coral”: In her will Mrs. Jessie
Litchfield, Darwin (N.T.), has left £5OOO
in trust to provide prizes for the best
novel, poem, essay or historical work —
preferably portraying life in the North-
ern Territory. Born in Sydney, Jessie
Litchfield had printer’s ink in her blood,
her maternal grandfather having been a
founder of “John O’Groats Journal,”
first published in Scotland in 1836. While
on a holiday trip to China she broke
the return-journey at Darwin for a short
stay, married there and, still in her early
twenties, went with her husband to a
home of hessian walls and iron roof on
the tinfields of West Arm, where
he was employed on the diamond-
drill testing for tin, living amongst
hundreds of wild blacks at Anson Bay.
In 1930 she became editor of the “North-
ern Territory Times,” and after the
journal was sold continued working as
a press-reporter, representing the leading
southern dailies, acting as Reuter’s Dar-
win representative, and over the years
doing a lot of work for The Bulletin.
In War II she was compelled to move
to Sydney, but after it was over she
returned to Darwin and her hosts of old
friends. Her writings helped John Flynn


in founding the Flying Doctor Service,
and in many other ways she did much
for the advancement of the Territory
and North Australia generally.

At the Sydney dinner by the
Australian Performing Rights Associa-
tion, at which he was guest-of-honor,
Aaron Copland showed the sense of
humor which invests some of his delight-
ful songs, and which is reflected in this
sketch by Prior. But Copland is best
known as a serious composer whose
works are in the most modern style, and
it’s in that capacity he has come with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra on their
goodwill tour, sponsored by President
Eisenhower. The composer acts as guest-
conductor and wields the baton when the
orchestra is playing his own works —as
he did at Sydney Stadium last week in
a memorable concert.
Born where the celebrated tree grew in
New York, Copland thumped the piano
as a boy to his sister’s tuition before he
knuckled down to tougher tutorship from
Wittgenstein, Wolfson, Goldmark and
Nadia Boulanger. Then he launched
straight into the field to which he has
since dedicated himself —limning the
American musical scene and writing a
variety of ballets and symphonies, con-
certos and music for the voice. Today
he’s in the front rank of American com-
posers, holds top positions in a swag of
CONTEMPORARY COMPOSER
organisations which further the improve-
ment of American composition, and is a
prolific writer on music for various
periodicals. He’s 60, but spry by a decade
or two less.

Harry J. Cranfield, who lately passed
on at 74 in Melbourne, was one of the
few remaining links with the old London
music-hall stage. Member of a theatrical
family tracing back to Charles and
Edmund Kean, he was born in London,
educated at Lancing College, and originally
studied law, but gave it away to follow his
eldest brother on the stage, where his early
training on the “halls” often meant having
tt> appear at as many as six theatres in one
night. Later he toured widely in South
Africa, the U.S., Canada and Europe, appear-
ing with such variety stars as Harry Lauder,
George Robey, Dan Leno, Fred Russell,
Arthur Carlton and Marie Lloyd.
Cranfield came to Australia after the
London music-hall actors’ strike in 1907, under
contract to Harry Rickards, of the Tivoli
Circuit, was associated with Wiliiam Ander-
son and Julius Grant in the “Ladder of Lite”
at the King’s Theatre, Melbourne, played in
Julius Knight’s memorable 1912 production ot
“The Sign of the Cross” and took part
in producing “The Mystery of the Hansom
Cab,” one of Australia’s earliest full-length
motion-pictures. For the last 30 years fie
had been known to children throughout

most, and the organisers were astounded
when no less than 400 turned-up for the
first lecture. Several more lectures have
been arranged, and “Jock”, who’s an
official of the Prospectors’ Association,
will then take his listeners into the field
somewhere round about, and practically
guarantees to find some more gold.

ABORIGINALITIES
\XfiTH a name like Clancy you can’t
* * help getting nicknamed “Clancy
of the Overflow,” and at one time
my father thought we might have
a genuine claim to it. Dad was a story-
book Australian of his age and time'.
He was a bushman and a shearer, who
later in life drifted into goldmining,
where, on a “poor man’s field,” he did
rather well. About the time of the
Burns-Johnston fight Dad had “business”
in Sydney and came down to see the
fight with a belt full of gold-dust. In
the bar at the Metropole “Billy” Wilson,
who was a sporting-writer on a Sydney
paper, introduced him to “Banjo” Pater-
son. “By the way, Mr. Paterson,” said
Dad, “somewhere in the late ’sixties my
grandfather was manager of the Overflow
Station, and I’Ve often wondered whether
you had him in mind in the poem.”
“I’m sorry, Archie,” said Banjo. “The
only thing which made me pick the name
‘Clancy’ was that it rhymed with the
word ‘fancy.’ ” —Francis Clancy.
* * * *
“Missus”: My original-Australian off-
sider was moved to vehemence by the
strains of “The Lambeth Walk” on the
kitchen portable: “Never have them old
dances any more! These blooming —•
whatcha-call-’em? —rock-’n’-roll dances,
Missus; they no good! Hopping roun’
like a lot of blackfellas at corroboree! ”
* * * *
“Kune”: The old dogma that cow-
cockies are a tight-fisted lot gets a rude
jolt in the Upper Kangaroo River
(N.S.W.) district, where a tiny community
of 25 families—all dairyfarming—formed
a progress association nine months ago
and have since raised £9OO towards build-
ing a public hall. Bulk of the money has
come from the sale of cattle ; the cockies
have been taking it in turn to send a
heifer to the nearest saleyards on behalf
of the new-formed body, the auctioneer
usually waiving his commission. When
the fund reaches £l2OO the whole popu-
lace —men, women and kids —will build
the hall on a half-acre block given by a
resident, the timber coming from trees
long-since earmarked for the job on the
various farms, and which a sawmiller in
an adjoining district has undertaken to
mill. For good measure, the association
runs another healthy fund towards
amenities for its tiny one-teacher, 13-
pupil school.
"New buildings going up—beautiful cars—everywhere signs of
Wealth and prosperity."
“Spinifex”: The chief claim to fame
made on behalf of Cunnamulla (s.-w.
Q.) when I spent my youth there was that
more horses had “won the double” there
than anywhere else on earth. Any glib-
tongued rover with a decent-looking bit
of horseflesh to sell in the northern State
usually clinched his sales-talk with the
statement that the prad had “won the
double at Cunnamulla.” The only other
township that might have contested the
claim was Augathella. Those two places
must have had race-meetings pretty well
every day of the week, and two on Sun-
days, because an awful lot of cuddies
or a lot of awful cuddies —had landed
doubles at them.

“North Esk”: A couple of university
students visiting Wynyard (Tas.) have
unearthed some fossilised bones of one
of Australia’s first marsupials. The
specimens—half-a-dozen vertebrae with
the ribs attached —are considered to be
of major importance. A notable fossil
discovery was made in the same area
towards the end of last century —the
remains of a primitive pouched animal
which was later named Wynyardis
bassensi. At the time of its discovery
it was the oldest fossil marsupial known
in Australia.

“Exped”: How long should an all-
wool Australian travelling-rug last? Ours
began service in our horse-and-buggy
days; babies have played (and been
sick) on it; it’s been the groundsheet
at countless bush and beach picnics;
has kept warm teenagers in many Scout
and Girl Guide camps and jamborees ;
been by train from Perth to Cairns and
back ; and now, back from the dry-
cleaners, a little thinner, perhaps, but
still serviceable, it is off on a 2000-mile
jaunt by car. Not a bad effort for a
parting gift made to us 35 years ago.

“Rehab”: The reported failure of an
electricity authority to halt the destruc-
tion of poles by poisoning white-ants
makes me wonder what poison was used.
When the timber of the store on an
N.T. cattle-station, the home of these
termites, was threatened, holes were
bored and a solution of arsenic intro-
duced—that stopped ’em. Taking-over
from the retiring bookkeeper-storekeeper
on this station I made a thorough stock-
taking. Unusual items such as silvo,
Brasso and Bon Ami—there wasn’t a pane
of glass on the station —ordered by some
energetic housekeeper or optimistic store-
keeper in a bygone era, when removed
from their place of repose upon the shelf,
revealed a hollow shell which had




miraculously supported its load—until we
attempted to replace the goods, and down
it went. Stocktaking in this area, I found,
could be a most enlightening task. In
the medical section iodine, friar’s bal-
sam and the like, neatly arranged along
the iron wall of the store in tempera-
tures up to 120 degrees, had long since
evaporated, leaving shrivelled-up corks
in empty bottles. Packets of macaroni,
spaghetti and vermicelli, when upended,
were found to contain nothing more
than a teaspoonful of fine dust, which
poured out through a hole chewed in
the corner of the cardboard. And when
delving into dark corners one was always
“Cant you practise PIANISSIMO?”
likely to come face-to-face with a dozing
Joe Blake.
* * * *
“Brick E”: Houses don’t have to be
built on high stilts to wobble ; I recall
one that used to get-up a bigger roll
than the schooner Hesperus—and its
blocks stood lOin. from the ground at
the lowest point and 18in. at the highest.
The blocks were of tea-tree, had been
there about 40 years, and, as the owner
flattered them, were “a bit decayed at
ground-level.” My job was to crawl
under the house with a truck-jack, lift
the weight from a stump, remove
stump, build a brick pier in its place ;
and so on. The easiest part of the job
was the removal of the stumps —they
fell over as soon as the weight was
lifted off them. But laying bricks while
stretched out flat on the tummy, head
knocking against the cobwebby joists of a
groaning, rocking house, is one of the
experiences you remember.

“Sebak”: My thanks to “Mulbong”
for his addendum to the par. on Rock
Davis (B. 25/5/’6O). I accept his state-
ment that the historic St. Paul’s C. of E.,
Kincumber (N.S.W.), was built by free
labor, not convict, but must question
the correction concerning the date of
erection. My information fixes the year
of commencement as 1836, and 1847
when the first service, was held. A
memorial-tablet just inside the entrance
brings in another sideshoot of history,
Erected by the widow of James Dunlop,
it records that he was: “. . . Member
of the French Institute. Astronomer
Royal at the Observatory, Parramatta,
N.S.W. Born in Daly, Ayrshire, Scot-
land, 31 October, 1785. Arrived with
Sir Thomas Brisbane on 7 November,
1821.” Sir Thomas, after whom
Queensland’s capital was named, was
a man of parts—a general in the British
Army, Governor of N.S.W., renowned
astronomer, president of the Royal
Society of Edinburgh, and president of
the British Association. He lived for a
time at Gosford (N.S.W.) on the shores
of the beautiful stretch of water that
still bears his name. The church at
Kincumber overlooks an arm of
Brisbane Waters.

“Corny Too”: My two youngest were
arguing whether the hen I had just put
on a setting of eggs was “sitting” or
“setting.” I remembered asking my
father the same thing, and his answer,
that when a hen cackled he was more
concerned as to whether she was “laying”
or “lying.”
* * * *
“Kerba”: I have never seen any bird
attack processional-caterpillars, and the
reason’s not hard to find. Let one of them
crawl over your skin and you’ll know
why they are known as “itchy grubs.”
Furthermore, a garment on which they
have wiped their feet in passing will
carry the irritant emitted by the hairy
bodies, and contact with the human
skin even two days later will bring up
itching lumps. This secretion is the
passport that permits them, either singly
or ia their normal column-of-route, head
to tail, to wriggle unmolested across the
beds of voracious meat-ants that would
unhesitatingly swarm to attack a still-
writhing snake. What would happen to
the throat and tongue of a bird which
swallowed the potent grubs wouldn’t be
hard to imagine. It was said in these
pages lately that the cuckoo really does
eat 'em—well, hence the term “cuckoo”.
* * * *
“Maitri”: At the dinner-table someone
wanted to know what’s the difference
between mist and fog. As usual, every-
body else knew and everybody knew
differently ; in no time we had to fly to
the dictionaries. The dictionaries were
vague and coy and really didn’t help
very much, so then we dived into the
encyclopaedia: “Fog may be defined
as a cloud that touches the ground,
reducing visibility to less than one kilo-
metre (1100 yards). Visibilities of be-
tween one and two kilos are defined as
mist or haze.” We’re still befogged.
Say, for argument’s sake, that the mist
is a mile or so off and I walk towards it
until the landscape is blanketed out less
than a kilometre from me —has it then
ceased to be mist and become fog with
no other change save in name?
* * * *
“Nor”: The fire-bell rang late at
night and the entire male population of
the little country town turned-out. The
fire, at the pub, was quickly dealt with
and the publican rewarded the fire-
fighters with free drinks. In a letter of
thanks printed a few days later in the
district paper the publican thanked “all
those who assisted at the fire, especially
the teetotallers.”

“Q. Ree” (Fiji): Most of the cattle
here, especially those used by the Indians
for ploughing and carting cane, are part-
Indian breed. They are big beasts, and
it’s <a sight to see a big bullock, with
widespread horns, grazing by the road-
side and being minded by a tiny Indian
tot.
* * * *
“Exped”: I know that it is dangerous
to camp under our red-gums and sugar-
gums because of their nasty habits of
shedding branches; but I never knew our
pine-trees could be such villains until I
read a most descriptive novel, Hurricane,
by an American author, John D. Mac-
donald. Evidently based on fact, the
novel describes the terrors and sufferings
of parties of motorists stranded on a
road on the west coast of Florida during
a hurricane:
Up and down the coast the rain softened
the root-structure of the Australian pines.
There is a city ordinance in Fort Meyers
prohibiting the planting of these pines
within the city limits. When drenching
rains precede winds of hurricane-force
the pines topple too readily.
In the story Australian pines fell and
blocked both ends of a road over a creek,
thus sealing the fate of the occupants of
the line of trapped cars. But as we have
no indigenous Australian pine-trees, what
tree is the villain of the story? Could it
be the Norfolk-pine, or is it a new name
for Pinus radiata, now grown so success-
fully around Mt. Gambier and other
places?


nPHEY might hang greenery from the
roofs of newly-erected buildings in
Europe, as several writers have here
attested, but a typically Australian touch
was the suspending of a brace of dead-
marines from the highest point of a
newly-finished branch-bank building in
W.A. The local manager, notorious for
his reluctance to dispense hospitality,
protested to the contractor, who informed
him it was a custom in the building-trade
for the owner to shout for all hands on
completion of a building, and that the
offending objects would be removed
after this was done. The manager,
convinced, duly shouted ; then debited
cost —15s. —to the bank’s Charges
Account and, informing head-office of
the circumstances, asked confirmation of
his action. The g.-m. was not impressed.
Back came the memo: “Manager’s
advices are astounding. Charges Account
to be recredited forthwith.” Obviously
not standard practice in Australia. —

“Sackville”: An oddity of the line-
fisherman is that he’s never content to
cast halfway; he seems convinced that
the farther he can throw his bait from
himself the greater his chances of catch-
ing the dream-fish. It's a common sight
at The Entrance (N.S.W.) to see the
patience of fishermen lined-up on either
side of the stream, each with his float
in the water a handful of yards
from the bloke on the opposite bank—
and both catching fish from right under
the other’s nose, as it were.
* * * *
“Irving”: The skipper of a floating
trading-station that used to operate in
Torres Strait was the essence of polite-
ness in his dealings with the natives.
When one mission-trained “boy” pro-
duced a Collins ready-reckoner as an
aid in computing the cost of his pur-
chases and questioned the accuracy of his
bill, the skipper gently drew his atten-
tion to the fact that the reckoner was of
an old edition and hence hopelessly
outdated as a guide for the cost of the
trade-goods then being bought. The
boy fell for it, hook, line and sinker.
CARVING-UP THE SEAS
How well do you know your oceans?
Does the Indian Ocean wash
Westralia’s southern shores? Is Wynd-
ham in the Indian or the Pacific Ocean?
Is there a Southern Ocean? If it comes
to that, is there an Antarctic Ocean?
You strike problems when you try to
draw boundaries in a liquid medium.
Where an ocean meets a continent its
boundary is obvious ; it can even be
accepted, with reservations, along a
chain of islands; but how do you
separate oceans with a common watery
frontier of thousands of miles, such as
the Indian, the Southern and the Antarc-
tic Oceans —that is, if there is a Southern
or an Antarctic Ocean?
There are two ways of doing it. The
cartographers join certain land-features
by straight lines drawn on a Mercator
Projection, and these boundaries can be
plotted easily by navigators. But even
cartographers can’t agree amongst them-
selves on the most suitable features to
use. As late as 1921 one of them, Kos-
sina, separated the Indian and Pacific
Oceans by a line across the Malacca
Straits from Singapore to Sumatra, along
the Indonesian Islands and across the
Timor Sea to Cape Talbot, west of Cam-
bridge Gulf, on which Wyndham stands.
“Poor fellow’s bedridden."
That placed Torres Strait, Gulf of Car-
pentaria, Darwin and Wyndham in the
Pacific Ocean. Others have established
the boundary across Torres Strait from
New Guinea to Cape York, including
all those places in the Indian Ocean.
The geologists and oceanographers, on
the other hand, ignore latitudes and
longitudes where possible. They plot the
principal submarine features, project the
highest and most important of these
crests to points on the surface and take
as the boundary a line joining these
points. Only where no suitable features
exist will they fall back on man-made
delineations, and they claim this is
seldom necessary
The result is that no one is at all clear
on how many oceans there are, or their
limits. One authority construes the
Indian Ocean's southern boundary as
• , , ..
latitude 40, its western boundary as the
mendian of longitude which passes
through Cape Agu has, in South Africa
and the eastern as the meridian of Souh
Cape, Tasmania Another authority
stops this ocean at a line drawn joining
Cape Agulhas and Cape Leeuwin The
confusmn increases with t e doubt
whether there s really a Southern Ocean
or not. If there is, it must lie between
the Indian and Antarctic Oceans, and
Sir John Herschel, who first suggested it,
bounded it on the north by a line con-
necting the most southerly points of the
three southern continents, and took this
as the southern limits of the Indian,
Pacific and Atlantic Oceans,
Later, a German hydrographer held
there were only these three oceans, and
he Extended them to the Antarctic con-
tinent. Others reject the concept of a
Southern Ocean, but accept the Antarc-
tic Ocean, bounded on the north by the
Antarctic Circle—which in places reduces
the ocean to a very narrow belt of water,
particularly in the Indian Ocean sector,
where parts of what is roughly called
Antarctica are outside the Arctic Circle.
The pack-ice of the south-polar region
extends roughly to the 60th degree
of latitude, and this also has been sug-
gested as the boundary between the
Indian and Antarctic Oceans,
When the argument has been resolved
there’ll probably be a certain amount
of agreement with many of the existing
boundaries. The western boundary of
the Indian Ocean will almost certainly
extend southwards from Africa at Cape
Agulhas, from where a submarine
feature known as the Agulhas Ridge runs
south-east and east to form a natural
western boundary. This ridge erupts in
surface features at Prince Edward
Tsla 5 ™ 2e ', Island Kerguelen Island
and Enderby Land On the eastern stde

INFLATION AND LAND PRICES
'T'he first shock-waves of
recent wage and salary in-
creases had been met by the
Australian economy with sur-
prisingly little disturbance so
far, the Bank of New South
Wales commented last week.
However, the bank warns
that it would probably be pre-
mature to take the complacent
view that inflationary fears had
been exaggerated.
The moderation of the rise
in the retail-price index in the
March quarter, while economic
pointers were pushing upwards,
had led many commentators to
take the optimistic view.
On the other hand, wage
decisions themselves had taken
time to swell the pay-packets,
and a further time-lag would
have to elapse for their effects
to work through to prices.
“The most conservative esti-
mates of the resulting increase
in the price-level of about 4
p.c. are so far above move-
mentsof the past few years that
they would threaten hopes of
relatively even and ordered
growth,” the bank added.
“Industrial output as a whole
is proceeding at a greater
volume than a year ago in cir-
cumstances of keen competition
which offer hope that at least
some part of increasing costs
can be absorbed,’’ says the
’Wales.
Employment, too, was strong
in spite of seasonal influences,
but was suffering from some
shortage of skilled labor which
could affect the efficiency of
some industries.
The bank says that unless the
Reserve Bank is prepared to
relax the reserve-deposit ratio,
the trading-banks could be
forced into pursuing a severely
restricted lending policy over
the seasonal trough.
“Meanwhile,” warns the
’Wales, / “the outside market
for finance, which has made
the running for the boom, still
continues its exuberant course.
“Though the stockmarkers
are steadier, other peripheral
activities appear to be stimulat-
ing a disquieting speculative
boom in land-values, which
makes it more difficult to tackle
potential inflation in a sane
way while the authorities re-
main intent only on checking
the banking system.”
Tn The Bulletin’.s opinion,
-*■ the boom in land-values is
something to be watched with
a greater degree of concern
than the share-boom.
To begin with, speculation in
that adds to the
cost of establishing homes,
farms or factories is a decidedly
inflationary factor. Higher
cost of homesites must eventu-
ally enter into wage-rates ; and
higher capital costs in farms
and factories add to production
costs in another way. This is
now occurring at a time when
the whole country is being
made aware of the imperative
need for us to become more
competitive with our exports.
A land-boom can end more
quickly and more disastrously
than a share-boom. Shares
usually cost little or nothing to
hold, even if bought at a too-
high price and giving a too-low
yield. But real-estate bears
rates, taxes, etc., and often
other expenses and liabilities
that become extremely onerous
when a boom ends and specula-
tive zest departs. At that point
there ceases to be a ready—and
daily—market such as exists
for shares.
In a little township about 35
miles from Sydney, just beyond
the new “Elsa"’ automatic-tele-
phone area, rumors are rife
that land in the district has
soared from a V.-G. valuation
of about £6O an acre to £l5O
an acre and upwards. About
five cases are quoted in gossip
around the village. To The
Bulletin’s own certain know-
ledge three of the stories are
false. In one case, at auction
(within the past month) less
than £75 an acre was the
highest bid.
If water should be piped to
the district there would be an
immediate—and big—rise in
land-values. But as yet it is an
area of farmland, not a suburb
or satellite-town.
Rumor and speculation of
this kind must be common in
many other parts of Australia.
And just as misleading and
dangerous.
Short-term Finance
Great resort has been made
to debt-finance of a
debenture or “note” nature in
Australia during the past five
years, particularly since bank-
overdraft finance has not been
so readily available during a
period of great industrial and
financial expansion, and since
company taxation has been so
high as to encourage the
employment of more debt-
finance and to rely less upon
issues of share-capital.
Nowadays the gearing of
borrowed money to capital and
other shareholders’ funds is
comparatively high —-sometimes
remarkably high. It has been
claimed that Australians have
taken a long time to. wake-up
to highly-geared methods of
debt-finance that have been
long practised overseas, par-
ticularly in Scotland.
It is true that Australians
have comparatively recently
swung-over to a higher gearing
of borrowed money in financ-
ing industrial development and
consumer-credit ; but to make
any real comparisons with
other countries it is necessary
to study the full terms on
which money is borrowed in
different communities.
A weakness in the present
Australian method of raising
debt-finance seems to be that
it tends to be too short in
term for some enterprises.
Well-spread short-term finance
may be perfectly all right in
the case of hire-purchase cos.
financing time-payment sales
with this sort of borrowing,
seeing that most h.-p. con-
tracts don’t run beyond two
or three years anyway. But
where short-term money is
employed extensively to finance
fixed capital-outlay, especially
real-estate, it could bring
difficulties in its train later on.
Where, in former days, bor-
rowed money was used to take
the place of share-capital,
borrowings were often for
periods-of 10 years ter 25 years,
and it would have been bad
luck if such borrowings became
due for repayment or renewal
during a period of financial
recession. Nowadays bor-
rowers in the form of notes

have something up for repay-
ment nearly every year, and
the greater proportion of
borrowings have a term shorter
than six years.
As mentioned previously,
this is probably quite satis-
factory where the money is
used to finance lending on an
equally short term. But bor-
rowing by h.-p. cos. has set
the pace for other types of
companies as well, and it does
not follow that what is good
for a h.-p. co. is equally good
for a company investing in
plant, land or bricks-and-
mortar. Borrowing to finance
capital-assets on short-term
notes has almost as many pros-
pective problems as borrowing
on overdraft for the same
purpose.
Jaywoth Industries, Ltd.
An issue of five-million ss.
shares in Jaywoth Indus-
tries, Ltd., was quickly over-
subscribed when the share-lists
opened in Sydney last week.
The issue was underwritten jfey
lan Walton and Co., of Sydney
’Change.
The co. has been formed td
quarry blue-metal, distribute
ready-mixed concrete, contract
for road-surfacing with hot
and cold asphalt-mixes and to
supply precast concrete-
masonry blocks for domestic,
commercial and industrial
buildings.
In the allocation of capital
requirements the prospectus
puts most emphasis on the
concrete-masonry plant. It is
proposed to employ Columbia
machines for making masonry
blocks because of their versa-
tility. They are extensively
used in the U.S.A., and are
automated and electronically
controlled. These plants will
be operated by the co. first of
all in Sydney, Brisbane and
Newcastle.
The co. is taking-over a
long-term lease of a quarry-
site at Martins Creek, on the
main northern railway, near
Maitland (N.S.W.).
Another activity of the co.
will be the manufacture of
Krimplock wall-reinforcement.
The co. has a strong and
experienced board. It com-
prises T. J. Wotherspoon, E. R.
Slade Slade, W. S. Johnson,
William Clinton (of Camden),
J. G. Wotherspoon (founder of
the original co. to make
masonry-block in Australia),
C. C. Nicholas and W. P.
Brown.
The co. is being floated at a
very busy constructional period
in Australian history, and
would appear to fill a special
want with its masonry-block
manufacture. That is import-
ant, because there is tending to
be an overemphasis on some
other types of construction
projects in Australia at pre-
sent.
There is no vendors’ con-
sideration involved. The
amount of preliminary ex-
penses, including underwriting
commission at 3d. a share, is
estimated at £lll,OOO. Initial
paid capital will be £1,250,000.
Cement in Fiji
■Cm Industries, Ltd., formed
to manufacture Portland
cement in Fiji from local raw
materials, looks like being a
technical and financial success.
Experts have been running
their eye over the proposition
for the past 18 months.
Shareholders are the C.S.R.,
B.P. (South Sea), W. R. Car-
penter and Co., Dickson
Primer, Development Finance
Corp., Warwick Ashley Pty.,
A. L. Bell (chairman of Kandos
Cement), W. P. McGrath (of
Besser Vibrapac) and E. T.
Hamilton. They have taken
the entire issue of 442,476 10s.
(Fijian) ords, equivalent to
£250,000 Australian.
Plant is expected to be
operating within 12 months.
Associated concrete industries
may then be established.
The cement-works will be a
new industry in Fiji, and the
Government has granted a
50-year lease of raw-materials
areas and the plant-site. Plant
has been bought in Australia.
Development Finance Corp.
is making a placement of the
shares among its clients, and
listing on Sydney 'Change will
be sought.

And that, of course, is the
ideal way to enjoy a capital

same time get stuck into a profit
of half-a-million from a tran-
saction that originally involved

There should be more of
this sort of thing. But how
is it done? What’s that?
Mirror Newspapers, Ltd.,
has now definitely passed to
News, Ltd. (Adelaide) con-
trol, and Rupert Murdoch is
making his presence felt in the
Sydney daily and suburban

G. E. Crane Holdings, Ltd.
One of the most prolific dis-
tributors of bonus-scrip
among Australian listed stocks
over the past decade, G. E.
Crane Holdings, Ltd., has again
advanced strongly in market
favor.
The most recent bonus dis-
tribution was in August last
year, when the present holding-
co. took over G. E. Crane and
Sons, Ltd., a Sydney co.
founded in 1867 and converted
to public status in 1949. The
operating-subsidiaries are mer-
chants and manufacturers of
aluminium, copper and brass
sheets, strip and circles; lead
sheet, pipe and dampcourse;
brass fittings for water, sewer-
age and gas services; extruded
metal containers; and building-
trade sheet-metal products.
Present paid-up ord. capital
is £815,183, following a virtual
one-for-one bonus issue last
year at the time of formation of
the present holding-co. There
is £200,000 of cheap 5 p.c. pref.
money in the former holding-
co. and a minority outside in-
terest in one of the subsidiaries
amounting to £89,198.
New issues since listing 10

four at par in 1950, a one-for-
two bonus-issue in 1951, one-
for-10 ditto in 1955, and last
year’s one-for-one handout.
Highest price on the market,
cum bonus, last year was 140 s
Lowest price in 1960 was 775.
Present price is 975. 6d.
Net profit of the group, prior
to takeover by the new Can-
berra - registered holding - co.,
was £257,488 (for 1958-59).
That was after depreciation of
£82,958 and taxation of
£165,059.
Allowing for pref. divs. in
the subsidiary, this was equal
to 30.3 p.c. on the present ord.
capital of the holding-co.
Current div. is at the rate of
10 p.c. p.a., equal to 20 p.c. on
the old capital, against 15 p.c.
for 1958-59. Net tangibles on
“Even as a little boy I Was lonely and unhappy
and nobody Wanted me.”
June 30, 1959, were equal to
about 60s. for each £1 of
present ord. capital.
The co. should be doing ex-
ceptionally well during the
present building-boom in Syd-
ney. But meanwhile the yield
on a 10 p.c. div. is only slightly
above 2 p.c. Still, a 15 p.c. div.
in the near future should be an
easy matter.

"poELOWiNG disclosure of the
highest profit on record
—£571,829, which is a jump
from £376,730 in the previous
year—Patons and Baldwins
ord. shares have leapt to 425.,
after a “low” of 31s. this year.
The dividend has gone up
from 8| p.c. to 10 p.c.
Book-values, especially those
of freeholds and plant, have
always been conservative, and
though the co. has been known
to take a step backwards in
its div. policy—there was a
drop from p.c. in 1957 to
6 p.c. in 1958 —the declaration
of a 10 p.c. rate this year
seems to indicate that finances
have been consolidated to the
point where, even in dealing
with a fluctuating commodity
like wool, the board can look
to the future on a more
optimistic basis.
In going onto a 10 p.c. div.
nine years after formation of
the public co. the board has not
rushed shareholders with
benefits. It was indicated in
the beginning that there
would be a building-up pro-
gramme in the co.’s formative
years ; and in those years the
co. encountered the highest
wool prices on record, and also
the lowest since 1949.

The Boston in Brisbane
The distinctive sound of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra
became evident as it struck-up
the Australian and U.S.
anthems. Once it got the feel
of the acoustics of the Bris-
bane City Hall and had begun
to stir -up the passions of
Beethoven’s “Eroica” excite-
ment began to mount. One
never suspected that music
could be quite as breathtaking
as this. Records seem quite
inadequate to catch the power
and splendor of this orchestra
in full flight.
Conductor Charles Miinch
used the same programme here
as for his first Moscow concert
in 1956, putting the “Eroica'’
first, just as Beethoven wanted.
The Boston reputation for
satin-smooth tone did not get
in the way of some fierce
touches in the symphony ;
these polished string-players
knew well how to provide an
almost rough, masculine sound
when it was wanted. Neverthe-
less, the very perfection of their
playing was itself a distraction.
It was sometimes hard not to
admire details of phrasing and
warmth of tone at the expense
of the music itself. Rarely had
basses sounded so audible, and
the fine discipline of the whole
band driven along under the
urgent beat of the conductor
was a joy to watch as well as
to hear.
When they came to the
novelty of the programme it
was possible to revel in the
sheer beauty of sound for its
own sake Walter Piston’s
Sixth Symphony was written
with the Boston Symphony in
mind, and it is a hand-tailored
fit. Solo players fell with
delight on passages specially
written for them, and the ’cello
leader produced such a rich
tone that one could forget that
in writing for the orchestra
Piston forgot to write for him-
self. The music was lively,
spectacular, even moving in the
adagio, but quite impersonal
just the same.
The concert ended with a
stunning performance of
Ravel's second suite from
“Daphnis and Chloe.” This
piece the Bostonians regard
with pride ; no other orchestra,
they feel, can touch them in it.
Munch, twirling his long baton
like a whirlwind, drew from his
players a staggering sound at
the climaxes. It seemed almost
tangible—even more powerful
than the wild applause that
followed.
Reading the programme be-
forehand, one thought greedily
of the music the orchestra
might have played if it had
stayed longer. Wagner and
Berlioz were obvious, so what
better than some of both as
encores? Munch, aware that
the occasion was burning deep
into the minds of his audience,
showed no signs of wanting to
stop.
Perhaps Boston audiences
have become used to their
splendid orchestra. Here, where
its brilliance has to be sampled
in one-night stands, no one
was ashamed to stand and
stare. It may be a long time
before we hear its like again.

The Boston in Sydney
One of the most striking
features of this giant orchestra
—the second-oldest of Ameri-
ca’s symphonic organisations
and the first to come to Aus-
tralia —is that it is mainly
composed of men who are
middle-aged to elderly ; there
are only three women among
the 108 members. Another, even
more striking, feature is the
youthful vigor and eagerness
with which the veterans and the
sprinkling of younger men
tackle the job in hand. The
split-second responses, the over-
all discipline and the beauty of
tone in the mass are to be
marvelled at.
The orchestra’s permanent
conductor, Charles Miinch,
had charge of the first concert
in Sydney. A stocky, silver-
haired man, he bustles up to
the podium, with a quick nod
acknowledges the applause,
whirls around, and within two
seconds his forces are stuck
into it. His style is crisp and
forthright, and his adjurations
range from a gentle rocking
on his feet with both arms
down full-stretch at his sides
to great flailings when he slips
them into overdrive. The
results he got amounted to the
most exciting event Sydney has
enjoyed in big music.
Munch came up initially
with an Olympian work to
match the size of his orchestra:
Berliozs “Fantastic Sym •
phony.” In all music there is
nothing like this delirious,
anguished portrayal of the
composer’s white-hot infatua-
tion for the Irish actress Hen-
rietta Smithson, and no better
symphony could - have been
chosen to show-off the Boston’s
capabilities.
Munch drove-along the flam-
boyant first section, which is
mostly Byronic passion raised
to powerhouse voltage, with
what might too lightly have
been taken to be frenzy, but
only appeared to be that. It
was always under complete
control as he drew special tone-
colors from this or that instru-
ment or group of instruments
while riding-out the storm.
The Waltz was a long stream
of lyrical beauty to which the
high strings and the harps—
this orchestra rates two of them
—contribute so richly.
There was plenty of rustic
charm in the “Scene in the
Meadows” movement, preluded
by an enchanting duet between
oboe and English-horn.
Violence was ushered in with
the unrelenting, ominous
rhythms of the “March to
the Gallows” section and
here tumultuous outbursts, fol-
lowed without modulation by
measured steps, were brilliantly
effective. The closing part,
“Witches' Sabbath,” was all
diabolic orgy, and here the
percussion-section used not the
tubular bells of our own resi-
dent orchestras but two great
brass bells, the biggest looking
as if it weighed close to 2001 b.,
and banged with a big mallet.
The final dance to the parody
of the Dies Iras was a whirl-
wind beautifully integrated.
Modern orchestral colora-
tions are cleverly fused with
classical procedures in “Varia-
tions, Chaconne and Finale'’ by
the contemporary American
composer Norman Dello Joio,
here given its first hearing in
Australia. A very listenable
work, with agreeable melodies
and strong rhythmic patterns,
it was played with great feel-
ing.
Roussel’s “Bacchus and
Ariadne" Ballet, Second Suite,
gave the lie to someone’s claim
that Roussel “possessed
every desirable characteristic
of a great composer except the
power of invention.” Invention
there is, and plenty of it, in
this meticulously craftedidance-
piece which always has the
accent on gracefulness, a
quality which Dr. Munch —
who here, as in the Berlioz,
dispensed with a sco r e—
brought out in the loveliest
vein. The work of some of the
principal desks was of virtuoso
standard. A good deal of the
solo work fell on the principal
clarinetist, who produced a
superbly mellow tone.

‘‘The Magic Flute”
In this Mozart opera—the
last offering in the Trust Co.’s
Sydney season—the absurdity
of Schickenader’s hotchpotch
of a plot about a Japanese or
Egyptian prince (after 170 years
there’s still uncertainty as to
which it is) wandering around
ancient Egypt seems less absurd
because of the wonderful skill
with which the composer built
characterisations through the
music. The production by
Stefan Haag had polish, and
the imaginative settings of
Desmonde Downing created
atmosphere by suggestion as
much as by visual impact.
Haag was well served in
general by his singers. Ronal
Jackson was as good a Papa-
geno as Sydney has seen and
heard for years; as well as

wringing rich comedy from the
role, he effectively adapted his
naturally dark-toned baritone
to the lighter mood.
Neil Warren-Smith, who
throughout the season has
shown that he is a versatile
actor as well as one of Aus-
tralia’s most polished singers,
invested his basso with a
splendid sonorousness in the
two great arias of the High
Priest Sarastro: the “Invoca-
tion” and the noble cavatina,
“Within These Sacred Walls.”
As Tamino, Ken Neate had
an off night, rarely achieving
easeful song. Gregory Demp-
sey’s Moorish slave was a neat
piece of work in both depart-
ments. Glenda Raymond
managed the punishing colora-
tura leaps of the famous
“Queen of the Night” aria with
accuracy and quality. Valda

Tears.”
The concerted singing was,
indeed, excellent —notably the
two quintets and the trio-sing-
ing by the Queen of the Night’s
attendants, Julia Malyon, Anita
Kelly and Christine Palmer.
Rosalind Keene rounded-off the
cast with a teasing perform-
ance as the bird-catcher’s elus-
ive bride.
The orchestra, under Karl
Rankl, gave any effervescent
account of the Overture and
first-rate support to the singers.

Philippe Entremont
Having got behind him the
cool correctnesses and the
austere jollities of the six-part
Bach Partita in B Flat Major,
No. 1, with which he began his
first Sydney Con. recital, and
the short exposition of classico-
romanticism in two of the
Capriccios of Brahms’s Op. 76,
the young French pianist de-
voted the remainder of his
programme to works best
suited to displaying the power
of his style and his ability to
cope easily with staggering
technical difficulties as well as
making the keenest appraisal
of the composer’s intentions.
Few modern pianoforte
sonatas are so highly charged
with furious energy and thrust
as Prokofieff’s Sonata No. 2
in E Minor, with its witty
episodes projected every few
bars in all sections but the
andante. Entremont tore into
it with great gusto ; but it was
gusto directed by a first-rate
mind, so that even the odd
rhythmical impulses never
appeared too odd and they fell
neatly into the musical jigsaw.
The whiplash finishes he im-
parted to the episodes gave a
fine dramatic touch, and
generally the work gained in
stature from his reading of it.
From this dynamism he
turned to Debussy for some
richly varied tone-paintings,
and in eight of the Preludes—
five from Book 1 and three
from Book 2 —found ample
material to test both his appre-
ciation of Gallic subtleties and
his handling of shimmering im-
pressionism.
The quality of elusive
shadows and dreamy mysteries
of “Delphic Dancers” was
captured exquisitely ; “The En-
gulfed Cathedral” was almost
startling in its evocation of
the drowned bells still mourn-
fully tolling; the hint of
mockery was never absent from
“The Interrupted Serenade”;
“Puck’s Dance” was unin-
hibited fun touched with
whimsy ; the tumbling clowns
almost had to be pushed off
the keyboard in “Minstrels”;
“The Wine Gate” was a splash-
ing of vivid colors ; “General
Lavine, Eccentric,” was full of
biting irony ; and the conclud-
ing “Fireworks” crackled and
spluttered and soared in a
blazing cascade of notes.
Entremont wound-up the
evening with a fine exposition
of virtuosity in Ravel’s
“Alborado del Gracioso,” in
which the resentful guitarist
and the love-song come to
grips. Speed and accuracy
have rarely . been in better
pianistic concordance.
At his second concert of the
week Entremont turned the
Euclidean argumentation of a
Mozart sonata (K. 282) into
flawless and seemingly joint-
less lyricism ; performed a
similar service to the post-
humus sonata in B Flat by
Schubert, and concluded with
a crystal-clear view of the
pictures at Moussorgsky’s
exhibition. (

Melbourne’s Henry Moore
“Gross anatomical inaccu-
racy” ... “a monstrosity” ...
“future generations [will] con-
clude that it is the ancient idol
of some cult in Melbournian
voodoo, early atomic era” ...
“hideous” . . . “intellectual
vomiting in bronze ...”
These are some of the more
ferocious outpourings that have
been finding their way into the
letters-to-the-editor columns of
Melbourne dailies ever since
Henry Moore.’s “Draped Seated
Figure,”- bought through the
Felton Bequest for the National
Gallery, arrived on the scene.
Probably not since Dobell’s
Joshua Smith portrait has a
single work of art provoked
such a concerted howl of mis-
informed abuse in this country.
,When one thinks of what
sculptors have been doing
throughout the world for the
past half-century or so, the
shindig caused by this conserva-
tive example of modern sculp-
ture verges on the ludicrous:
that is, until one also con-
siders the amount of money
that changed hands over it—
£7s°?Tthe s ° rt °£ mone y K that
f° uld have bou § ht something

even a fairly decent racehorse,
By any standards Melbourne
is sculpturally a barren place:
large-scale works that have
anything more than size or the
of a celebrated
national figuie to recommend
t bem are conspicuously lack-
,^ b)S . a ° ne wou J d seem
sufficient justification for hail-
in§ tbe . purchase of a work by
an artist ot Moores standing
and obvious quality.
At the moment the “Draped
Seated Figure” is on view at
the Gallery in a setting which
does it little justice. What it
needs—and this is apparently
what it will have at its future
home in the courtyard of the
proposed cultural centre in St.
Kilda Road —is space to
“breathe’’ in, sunlight to add
lustre to its surface textures,
natural shadows to bring out
the beauty of its contours, the
angular planes of a modern
building to lend a sense of
proportion. It cannot exist in
isolation, connected to a mere
pedestal.
The sculpture, which is in
unpolished bronze, consists of
a broad female figure in classic-
ally draped robes ; it is about
Bft. tall and is said to weigh
one ton.
Massive and inclined to
squareness, the figure’s torso
invests the whole with an
immense sense of solidity. The
angular arms, with elbows
slightly raised, seem at first to
be in positions of stress, as if
supporting the main weight of
the body, perhaps about to
raise it. But closer examina-
tion reveals that the hands and
wrists are utterly relaxed, and
the total impression is of com-
posed, but not quite peaceful,
meditation.
The breasts are curiously
stunted, the hips roundly jutting
and related to the thighs, back
and stomach with bulky grace.
The legs, lying one on top of
the other, form two almost
horizontal planes magnificently
resolved with the upper
portions.
As the viewer’s eyes sweep
upwards the figure seems to
become less of a lump; the
encircling folds of the drape
begin to reveal with growing
force the firm yet delicate
structure of the body.
And then the enigma: the
head, which, in a manner
characteristic of Moore, domin-
ates all else by its relative
smallness, its lack of a readily
definable attitude or ex-
pression.
This sculpture will obviously
refuse to yield its secrets more
than a few at a time ; a full
understanding of it will dawn
only after many patient, sym-
pathetic visits.

Sydney Exhibitions
Sydney art for the week is
too frail a blossoming for this
frosty season. Carl Plate at the
Clune Galleries is showing
tinted abstract drawings, very
much like anyone’s
and only in a couple of small
oils getting the pleasing intima-
tions of reality he has in his
larger abstracts at the Mac-
quarie Galleries. Herbert
Flugelman at the Macquarie
Galleries, trying a variety of
styles from semi-abstraction
and the stylised landscapes of
the Melbourne school to primi-
tivism and more - or - less
straightforward realism, doesn’t
seem to know where he is or
where he should go. The
vibrancy of “Red Rocks” and
“Little Dead Gums” clearly
indicates the most profitable
direction.
Films
“Once More, with Feeling’'
The title of this coruscat-
ingly witty London-set comedy
is doubly apt, for the whole
thing revolves around the pri-
vate and orchestral life of a
conductor with a gigantic ego
and a temperament made of
barbed-wire and satin. The
dialogue, with champagne-
bubbles rising through it,
simply fizzes with sophistica-
tion, and the interior sets are
cleverly tailored to fit the great
man’s vanity.
The rather involved plot is
concerned chiefly with the des-
perate efforts of the baton-
wielder and his manager to
induce his fed-up consort to
return to him and exercise her
undoubted charms on all the
important people whose corns
he keeps jumping on.
In this, her last film, the late
Kay Kendall imparts in liberal
measure that unique brand of
daffy comedy and facile charm
which made her an adornment
to the cinema. Yul Brynner,
as the perfectionist conductor,
conveys the usual virility, but
is overshadowed by Gregory
Ratoff as the harassed manager.

COLUMN
The Myer Emporium, Ltd.
The Australian retail industry is the
scene of rapid reorganisation
governed primarily by American prece-
dent. It involves heightened appreciation
of customer requirements, refinement and
multiplication of selling techniques, pro-
vision of more varied and liberalised
credit-facilities, the supermarket, and the
development of suburban regional
shopping-centres.
Myer Emporium, Ltd., the Melbourne-
based retail giant, conforming to latest
trends in the trade and modifying U.S.
practice to fit Australian conditions, dis-
plays an ingenuity and, despite its size
and widespread ramifications, an agility
and flexibility which give the group con-
tinued supremacy in its chosen field.
The huge £6-million Chadstone (Mel-
bourne) project should be in full swing
by next October. Myer’s bid to parallel
similar-type regional shopping-centre
developments overseas, it will rank, when
completed, as Australia’s largest drive-
in venture. The Myer complex holds
other big, but'as yet undeveloped, tracts
of real-estate in and around Melbourne,
and purchases of land have been made,
as well, in Sydney’s green-belt, giving rise
to much speculation.
For sheer volume of business the
Myer organisation is the largest of its
kind in the country, total income last
term rolling in at an average rate of over
£1,000,000 a week. Principal members
of the group are the parent, in Mel-
bourne’s Bourke Street, Myer (S.A.), Ltd.
(Adelaide), McWhirters, Ltd. (Brisbane),
Brownells, Ltd. (Hobart), plus its
subsidiary Johnston and Miller
Pty. (acquired in March, 1959, on a share-
exchange basis; 90 ss. ords. in Myer
Emporium, Ltd. for every 100 ss. ords.
of the Tasmanian co.), and Allan and
Stark, Ltd. (Brisbane).
In August of last year, after close of
accounts and while the other retail-
strongmen of the east played catch-as-
catch-can in N.S.W. and Vic., Myer out-
flanked, spearing northwards. Cox Bros,
had just made a bid for Allan and Stark,
Brisbane, but Myer clinched the struggle
and the eventual outcome by offering 2\
of its ss. ords. (or alternatively 625. 6d.
cash) for each 20s. ord. of Allan and
Stark and \\ ss. ords. (or 375. 6d. cash)
for each 20s. pref.
Myer’s now control Brisbane retail
trade from both ends of the city—Mc-
Whirters dominate the Valley, the deal
as well granting sovereignty over a
successful drive-in shopping-centre at
Chermside (a Brisbane suburb). Another
drive-in centre is on the drawing board.
Other subsidiaries trade in Victoria’s
second- and third-largest cities, Geelong
and Ballarat. A manufacturing offshoot,
Wendouree Woollen Mills Pty. (Ballarat)
produces blankets, tweeds, dress-mate-
rials, underwear and outwear, the parent
itself operating a number of production-
units of which a furniture- and bedding-
factory near Melbourne is-the largest.
The group, as a whole, established new
records for both turnover and earnings
during the year to July 31 last, net sales
rising by £3,463,977 (6.4 p.c.) to
£57,572,566. All subsidiaries contributed
to the general success including
Wendouree Woollen Mills Pty., which,
“after a very difficult two-year period in

f Including staff partner and employee shares.
Calculated after providing £1,781.843
(up £227,568) for taxation and £504,549
(up £31,131) for depreciation, the profit
covered divs. on pref. and employee scrip
and 36.7 p.c. on average ord. capital
compared with 30.5, 25.9 and 23.3 p.c.
back to 1956. After the 16f p.c. div.,
over 52 p.c. of earnings was available
for reinvestment in the business.
A one-for-one bonus-issue in 1951,
following revaluation of fixed assets,
added £1,750,000 to paid capital, issues of
scrip in connection with the McWhirters
and Brownells deals lifting the total
to £5,505,619 as at last balance-date,
of which £655,450 carries a fixed 9 p.c.
and £99,500 is in staff-partnership shares.
The ord. div.-rate was cut from Ilf
p.c. to 7f p.c. after the bonus-issue, but
was increased to 10 p.c. in 1953, 12f p.c.
in 1954 and 15 p.c. in the following year,
reaching the current 16f p.c. level in
1958.
At July 31 last, reserves, including
£750,000 set aside for building-replace-
ment, exceeded paid capital by £4,464,598,
the balance-sheet disclosing a sound
financial structure and a particularly
high degree of liquidity. With theore-
tical working-capital on the £lO-million
mark the group had approximately £2
in current assets for every £ of current
liabilities:

Stocks, conservatively valued at
£7,948,290, showed little variation. The
growth of credit sales took debtors up
another £1,521,645 (£9,054,523). Cash,
deposits, etc. (up £395,883 at £3,584,248),
indicate an ample liquid core in the
high current-ratio. Creditors were up
but bank overdraft declined.
Hefty fixed-asset investment attended
the continued development at Chadstone
and the further modernisation of and
improvements at Bourke Street. The
book-value, after depreciation, of free-
holds etc., rose £1,224,815 (£8,333,323) ;
of plant, fittings etc., £332,198
(£2,736,697).
Myer’s obviously contemplate a large-
scale expansion with full exploitation
of the better times being experienced.
The road to the future will be marked
with new “Chadstones” and, there is
little doubt, an eventual invasion of
N.S.W.
Recent easing of import-restrictions
should help, rather than hinder, the
organisation.
The sharemarket puts a value of over
£34 million on aggregate ord. equity,
the ss. ords. fetching 365. when last
traded. Immediate yield is a slender 2.3

balance-date the consolidated accounts
showed a visible net tangible backing
of 16s. for each ss. ord.

Moran and Cato, Ltd.
A/Toran and Cato, Ltd., is one of the
largest and most successful chain-
retailers in Australia. The long-estab-
lished group operates 166 retail grocery
stores in N.S.W., Victoria, Tasmania and
South Australia. In addition there are
two wholesale subsidiaries, Sydney
Grocery Pty. and Australian Wholesale
Grocery Pty.
A holding-co., Moran and Cato (Aus-
tralia), Ltd., is currently being formed.
Paid capital will be doubled and share-
holders will benefit by an effective one-
for-one bonus when the formalities are
completed. This is said to reflect the co.’s
“endeavor to keep called-;up capital more
in line with total capital employed in
the enterprise.” It would seem that
the co. is determined to keep out of the
clutches of Coles or Woolworths.
The latest windfall to seripholders
follows on a one-for-four bonus-handout
made last term, accompanied by a
dividend-increase from \2\ p.c. to 15 p.c.
on the bonus-enlarged capital. “Con-
siderable sums representing undistributed
profits have been retained in the busi-
ness” since Moran and Cato first
appeared on the sharemarket, and it is
gratifying to see that the shareholders are
being treated to a fair slice of the cake.
Competition continues to be brisk. Last
year “several retail outlets have been
closed because of either unsuitability of
site or lack of selling-area.” Growth of
self-service stores has been a character-
istic feature of retail trade. There is a
strong trend by drapery-retailers to sell
groceries at lower prices in order to stimu-
late the basic turnover. Variety-chain
and country general stores are establish-
ing food-departments to attract business.
Decentralised food-markets and shop-
ping-centres tend to draw customers away
from some suburbs. The number of
larger establishments that have sufficient
space to display a wide range of food
and non-food lines is rising.
Profit-margins continued to slide, but
greater turnover (up 14 p.c.) and lower
expense-ratio resulted in earnings which
“can be regarded as satisfactory.”
The wholesale subsidiaries traded
profitably, but the advent of “buying-
groups” and extension of self-service
stores “restrict to a marked degree” pos-
sibilities of their expansion.
Consolidated trading-profit for the year
ended August 1, 1959, increased by
£159,053 to £728,531. Consolidated
operating net profit was £135,181 higher
at £609,773 after charging directors’ and
auditors’ fees and other expenses
and setting-aside £88,402 for depreciation
(up £8244).
Consolidated net profit increased by
£78,219 to -£366,548, after providing
£244,523 for taxation (up £56,968):

This was equivalent to an earning-rate of

capital, compared with 29 p.c. in 1958
(adjusted for tax overprovision) and 20.1
p.c. in 1957, 18.5 p.c. in 1956 and 20.4
p.c. in 1955.
The div.-rate was increased to 15 p.c.
by a 2\ p.c. bonus. The cheque
absorbed £72,850 more on the larger
capital.
Total reserves and undistributed profits
were disclosed at £1,486,586, free of
intangibles, at August 1, 1959.
Paid capital increased by £369,000 to
£1,369,000 in 10s. ords. The increase

revaluation was made in 1958). Plant
was £59,179 higher at £525,094. Stocks

working-capital was a bit lower at
£449,863.
Net tangible asset-backing worked out
at 20s. lOd. for each 10s. ord. at balance-
date.
Since the end of last term sales have
continued to improve. Directors say
profit was “well maintained” during the
half-year to January 23. The co. does not
pay interim divs., and the div.-rate after
the bonus-issue will be a matter for specu-
lation.
Moran and Cato is a strong and
vigorous concern. Competition has always
been extremely lively in the trade, and
only the fittest survive. But the manage-
ment seems confident, and determined
to remain independent.
At the last sale in Sydney the 10s. ords.
fetched 435. cum rights. The, immedi-
ate yield on the basis of last year’s 15
p.c. dividend is 3.5 p.c.
Wunderlich, Ltd.
Incorporated in N.S.W. in 1904 and re-
registered in 1908, Wunderlich, Ltd.,
dates back to the early 1880’s, when the
co. began producing metal ceilings. The
business grew rapidly and spread through-
out Australia and New Zealand. The
co. operates factories in N.S.W., Queens-
land, Victoria, S. Australia and Tasmania
and holds a substantial share-interest
in H. L. Brisbane and Wunderlich, Ltd.,
in W. A.
The co. is one of the largest Aifstralian
manufacturers of terra-cotta roofing-
tiles and architectural and industrial
metalwork and asbestos-cement products.
Output from Wunderlich's 18 fac-
tories and tileries covers such products
as metal ceilings, fascias and grilles,
aluminium curtain-walling and window-
frames, stainless-steel sinks, roofing-tiles,
asbestos-cement sheets and mouldings,
ceramic facings, stoneware pipes and
numerous allied lines. The more recent
additions to the co.'s range include
domestic aluminium window-frames and
vertically-grooved asbestos-cement sheet-
ing. The co. has a worth-while export
trade with New Guinea and the South
Pacific Islands.
Wunderlich’s earnings are influenced
strongly by the rate of homebuilding.
The continuing inflow of migrants and
a fairly liberal credit policy contributed
to the maintenance of a steady rate of
expansion in the building industry.
According to official statistics, the total
number of new houses (contract- and
owner-built) completed in Australia in
the calendar-year 1959 was 57,782 (up
5135). Of this, 18,950 were built in
N.S.W. (up 1624).
Increasing competition in the building-
and building-supplies trade and- sub-
stantial cost-increases (which have to be
absorbed by producers) again reduced
profit-margins.
H. L. Brisbane and Wunderlich, in
which the co. has a substantial holding,
reduced its dividend from 12| p.c. to

Book-value of freeholds
increased by £53,963 to

Current ratio worked out at

New houses commenced and
completed in the first quarter
of 1960 continue to show a
rising trend, according to
official estimates. The rising
trend in home-building should
ensure a steady improvement
in effective demand for Wun-
derlich’s products. However,
mounting costs, which the co.
has to absorb because of stiff
competition, may continue to
dampen the earning-rates on
an increasing turnover. Cost-
control could prove quite a
problem if sales should even-
out or slide back.
In the meantime Wunderlich's
scrip is doing well on the share-
market. At the last sale in
Sydney the 20s. ords. changed
hands at 725. 6d. per £1 unit.
The immediate yield is 3.4 p.c.
on the basis of the steady 12i

Net tangible asset-backing

Moffat-Virtue, Ltd.
T ast year brought no
' improvement to this

the same as in the previous

about by the same factors.
The co. has been plagued by
a vicious circle of insufficient
turnover leading to high over-
head costs, in turn necessitat-
ing a lower output to cut
expenses, resulting in an in-
adequate volume of sales.

co.’s effort to build-up its sales
has been unsuccessful.
Accumulating losses cause a
drain on reserves.
Moffat-Virtue, Ltd., is a
manufacturer and merchant
dealing mainly with primary
producers. This leaves it open
to adverse influences of
fluctuations in rural incomes
and to seasonal variations.
The co. produces milking-
machines, power - generating
plant, shearing-gear, pumping-
and irrigation-equipment, etc.
In addition there are several
agency lines. A fully-owned
subsidiary operates in Queens-
land.
The last profit of any con-
sequence was made in 1951,
when the parent earned
£55,485 a’nd paid a 10 p.c.
ord. div. Next year net profit
fell to £11,202 (consolidated),
and the div.-rate was cut to
8 p.c. The last ord. div. was
2\ p.c. paid in 1954, when
a token £2335 was earned.
The 8 p.c. pref. div. has been
maintained throughout.
Seasonal conditions in
N.S.W. “were anything but
good.” This was a blow,
because 64 p.c. of the co.’s
machinery turnover is in the
State. Inter-State trading “was
under review,” and “a change
was made” in W.A. and S.A.,
resulting in “improved sales.”
Factory production was
limited with a view to reduc-
ing stocks of manufactured
lines to match the sales. “This
policy has been responsible
for the losses in the factory,
forming the bulk of the loss
disclosed.” Moffat - Virtue
(Queensland) Pty. again showed
a small surplus. The asso-
ciate, J. A. Prestwich-Virtue
Pty., continued to trade
profitably.
Turnover was said to have
picked-up slightly, resulting
in a small reduction in losses.
Consolidated net loss for the
year ended December 31,
1959, was £23,498 (£24,320 in
1958), after providing £5472
for depreciation (up £574).

value dates back to trying
times in 1936 when 7s. 6d.
was written-off each 20s. stock-
unit to offset deficits.
In spite of the string of
setbacks, Moffat-Virtue keeps
a hopeful face. The co. has
arranged to represent “several
lines” which promise increased
turnover. The “major project”
(referred to previous year)
expected to utilise the idle
plant - capacity has “taken
longer than anticipated to
mature.” It is expected to yield
results in the current term.
Brighter spots in the sober
picture are J. A. Prestwich-
Virtue, an associated co.
operated in conjunction with
the well-known J. A. Prest-
wich Industries of U.K., and
the connection with Steyr-
Daimler - Puch, of Austria.
The associated co. manufac-
tures a highly-regarded range
of air-cooled engines, while
the Austrian firm produces
two-wheel vehicles which are
to be assembled in Australia.
How helpful these two
ventures will be in turning the
tide remains to be seen. At
the last sale in Sydney the
12s. 6d. f.-p. ords. fetched
Bs. 6d. each. Net tangible
asset-backing is 225. for each
ord. on consolidated reserves,

tion (£60,935).
New Guinea Goldfields
IVew Guinea Goldfields,
Ltd., holds leases over
lode and alluvial gold-bearing
areas on the Edie Creek gold-
fields in New Guinea, where
it operates power, milling,
cyanide and alluvial plants.
The co. is also interested in
sawmilling and logging, owns
a coffee-plantation and engages
in other diversified trading-
activities, including road-
freighting and providing power
services.
Paid capital has remained
unchanged at £782,658 in
4,472,332 f.-p. 3s. 6d. ords.,
which last fetched 2s. 7d. a

During the year ended
June 30, 1959, the Upper
Ridges and Golden Peaks
mines produced 41,381 tons
of ore (down 732 tons), of
which 3414 came from Upper
Ridges and Homestead, and
37,967 from Golden Peaks
opencuts. Average grade of
ore milled was adversely
affected by the virtual suspen-
sion of ore-extraction at No. 2
adit, pending completion of
No. 3 adit. The average gold-
content (assay) was 0.2570 z.
gold a ton treated, compared
with 0.2780 z. in the preceding
term.
At a point in the adit, 918 ft.
from the surface, an orebody
of solid calcite and rhodo-
chrosite was intercepted for
a width of 9ft. with an average
gold-content of 0.470 z. This
ore (7-B lode) has been opened-
up for a length of 240 ft.
The Golden Ridges mill
treated 47,420 tons (up 3726
tons) for an extraction of
11,1560 z. gold (up 2310 z.) and
15,0070 z. silver (up 16870 z.).
Recovery efficiency improved
from 90.1 p.c. to 91.4 p.c.
Alluvial operations, including
sluicing of Golden Peak’s
overburden, returned 12760 z.
of bullion (up 2350 z.). Repairs
to stamp-batteries were again
heavy, because of the effect on
milling operations by the fine,
relatively soft, Peak’s ore.
Koranga joint - workings
treated 636,528 cu.-yards for
a production of 24490 z. gold.
In the previous term sluicing
was suspended because of a
landslide.
Sawmill-output was lower
and earnings dropped slightly.
Technical alterations are ex-
pected to improve efficiency by
25 p.c. Coffee-sales realised
£l5OO. Various agencies at
Lae brought-in a shade more
at £6621, included in miscel-
laneous income.
Bullion-sales amounted to
£235,910 (up £4726), gold-
subsidy was £19,999 (down
£9576). Other income was
£276,073, making total gross
earnings £531,982 (down
£21,924). Net profit for the
year was £26,015 lower at
£88,654 after charging all
expenses, including £42,495
depreciation and redemption
write-offs (almost steady). An
unchanged div. of 3d. a stock-
unit went out to shareholders
on December 9, 1959.
At balance-date £150,735
liquid assets (including
£98,221 cash and bullion, but
excluding £120,531 stores and
stocks at cost) covered
£42,692 external liabilities
more than three times. This
left £108,043 surplus liquids
to back a paid capital of
£782,658.
Current term's results will
be affected to some extent by
taxation, newly introduced in
the Territory.
Ore reserves were last esti-
mated at 172,870 tons, com-
pared with 213,625 tons in
1958.


MAORILAND FINANCE AND INDUSTRY
Wellington, June 7, 1960.
“Tf we are to develop as a
nation we must endeavor
to see that those who risk
capital and are prepared to
venture will have an adequate
reward.”
Who said that? Some die-
hard Nationalist? No, it was
the Labor Minister of Finance,
Mr. Nordmeyer, addressing a
Junior Chamber of Commerce
gathering last week.
The sentiments were refresh-
ing, but the expression of them
came rather strangely from
one who, to put it mildly, has
not in the past shown much
interest in encouraging “those
who risk capital.”
It was Mr. Nordmeyer who,
only a year or two ago, slapped
a tax of up to 7s. in the £ on
dividends in shareholders’
hands—after taxing their com-
panies’ net profits at the
extortionate rate of 10s. in
the £.
Not much thought for those
who risk capital there.
Change of Heart?
It would be pleasant to think
that Mr. Nordmeyer’s remarks
last week indicate a change of
heart, but it would probably
be overoptimistic.
In the same address, Mr.
Nordmeyer said something
else that is, unfortunately, only
too true.
There was too small a
margin allowed in the reward
between skilled and unskilled
labor, he declared. He was
appalled at the way N.Z. had
slipped behind other countries
in the world in the margins
allowed for skill and respon-
sibility.
“We must face-up to the
paying of adequate rewards to
men who carry heavy respon-
sibility,” he said.
No doubt employers are
partly to blame for the present
unsatisfactory position, but the
Minister’s own political party
must accept a major share of
the responsibility. Over the
years it has consistently
encouraged the destruction of
margins.
Unintelligible Accounts
The vague, incomplete and
confusing mass of figures
given by the Minister of
Finance, Mr. Nordmeyer,
under the heading of Public
Accounts has caused a storm
of indignation.
As the “N.Z. Herald” puts
it: “The case has become
compelling for a statutory and
binding obligation on the
Minister of Finance, whom-
soever he may be, to present
the accounts in a precisely
prescribed and intelligible
form.”
On Mr. Nordmeyer’s figures
the net, or effective, deficit for
the year to March 31 was
£18.3 million.
Cash balances were run
down from £23.7 million (N.Z.
currency) to £4.4 million —a
total of £19.3 million—and
there was £l5 million of fresh
borrowing from the Reserve
Bank.
Against the total of £34.3
million Mr. Nordmeyer offsets
£l6 million invested overseas,
giving a net deficit of £18.3
million.
This offset is highly ques-
tionable. It seems that £l5
million of inflationary Reserve
“Just a formality, honey. We artists understand that real
talent cant be measured with a tape.”
Bank credit has been created
to make possible the invest-
ment abroad of £l6 million
of real savings.
The whole story is probably
a good deal worse than this,
but the figures supplied are so
confusing as to defy proper
analysis.
It is clear, however, that Mr.
Nordmeyer has been indulging
in some heavy deficit-financing
at a time when taxation is at a
record level.
Social Security
The fundamental trouble is
N.Z.’s fantastic expenditure on
social security, much of which
represents accumulated election
bribes.
In the last year social-
security expenditure amounted
to £109.2 million, including
£82.6 million in monetary
benefits, £3.9 million arising
from the capitalisation of
family benefits, £19.9 million
for medical and hospital bene-
fits and £2.8 million for
administration.
The huge total of £109.2
million should be considered
in relation to receipts from
income-tax, including social
security tax, amounting in all
to £175.2 million.
The amount of family bene-
'fits is not separately shown in
the published figures, but the
estimate for the year was £33
million. It would be the best
thing possible for N.Z. if this
preposterous benefit were
wiped out completely. Some
other provision could be made
for cases of real, deserving
need, which should be few in
a prosperous country with a
serious shortage of labor. But
what political party would
have the courage to act?
Meat Export Development
To promote orderly develop-
ment of the export meat trade
to underdeveloped markets, the
N.Z. Meat Producers Board,
acting jointly with the N.Z.-
owned Freezing Works Asso-
ciation, has established a N.Z.
Meat Export Development
Company.
Mr. J. D. Ormond, chair-
man of the Meat Board, in
announcing the establishment
of the company, said: “I be-
lieve this is the most important
move made in the meat
industry for many years.
“It is designed to expand our
trade in markets which may
be considered underdeveloped,
and it is planned that this work
will be done by co-operation
between the trade and the
board.”
The Wool Cheque
With wool receipts expected
to total about £108,000,000
(£27 million more than last
year), the wool season which
ended last week was probably
the best N.Z. has had.
Total output for the year
has been estimated at about
565,000,0001 b.—an increase of
4j per cent, on last year.
Hopes that the initial aver-
age price of 45d. a lb. —9d. a
lb. more than last year —would
be maintained throughout the
season, seem to have been ful-
filled ; in fact the season has
been notable for its consistency
and steadiness.
New Loan
The Government has opened
a £l5 million cash loan for
public subscription.
The terms offered are the
same as those of the recent
conversion offer, namely three-
year stock at £4 7s. 6d. per
cent. ; six-year stock at
£4 12s. 6d. per cent.; 12-year
stock at £4 15s. per cent.
Mr. Nordmeyer said the
recent conversion offer had
been most successful, and of
the total stock maturing—
£lo,9oo,ooo, of which £3
million was a special depart-
mental holding £9,900,000
was converted, representing 91
per cent, of the loans.


given Mick the satisfaction of
knowing he had “put the wind-
up that bloody cat.”
But after that first morning
he never bolted and never
showed the slightest symptom
of fear. Instead he showed
only a mixture of complacency
and contempt. If the veranda
chairs were unoccupied he
strolled slowly through the
ward to the Sisters’ office and
waited until the coast was
clear. If there were patients
sunning themselves he strolled
just as leisurely to the nearest
occupied chair, rubbed himself
against it and purred loudly.
Invariably the patient picked
him up.
It was a move calculated to
infuriate old Mick, but it
rendered him powerless and
Ambrose knew it. The
patients were to a man on
Ambrose’s side ; he was
Sharon’s cat and Sharon was
young, attractive and popular
with everyone.
was the situation when
Sister Sharon went off for
her three days’ break and her
place on night-duty was taken
by Sister James, a hardened
old spinster usually referred
to by the patients as Old
Battleaxe. Sister James and
Mick had one thing in
common: they both hated
cats.
Poor Ambrose must have
felt quite shocked the night
Sister James arrived in Ward
Three. He was sitting beside
the desk, waiting for Sharon
to walk in, pick him up and
cuddle him while she studied
the report-book and took-
over from the day staff.
Instead Sister James bustled
in with a very different
approach.
“What's that cat doing
here?” she demanded. With-
out waiting to hear the
explanation she picked-up the
report-book, made a swipe at
Ambrose and snapped: “Out
of here, cat! Go on, clear
out! ”
Ambrose took the hint.
Banished from his favorite
place, he slipped smartly into
the darkened ward.
Sister James didn’t even
look to see where he went.
He had obeyed her by clear-
ing out and that was enough
for her for the moment.
There were more important
things to be attended to, much
more important, she soon
learned. With one patient on
the dangerously-ill list, two
others on the verge of it and
no junior nurse to help her
it looked as if she could
expect- a hectic night.
As it turned out, she was
in for three hectic nights.
Ambrose must have done a
little thinking when he slipped
into the ward. It was dark
and cheerless in there after
the bright warmth of the
Sisters’ office, but it was
better than being outside where
a whistling wind and driving
rain combined to make con-
ditions unfit for any cat.
Experience had taught him
that he could expect no com-
pany in the ward once the
lights were put out, but that
night he was in luck. A dim
blue light burned over bed-16 ;
screens surrounded it, and
from behind the screens
came an occasional low
murmur of voices.
Ambrose investigated. The
screens were no hindrance to
him ; he could and did walk
under them with his tail erect.
A stroking hand rewarded his
purr, and he settled down for
the night. The two relatives
sitting by the unconscious
patient were in for a long,
weary night and to them
Ambrose came as a welcome
distraction.
The patient died at sunrise,
and since his- death had been
expected it caused little
comment.
“He had good company
anyway,” the lad in bed-17
remarked. “Ambrose camped
under his bed all night. First
time I’ve ever known him
spend the night in the ward.
I'll bet Old Battleaxe hunted
him out of the office.”
Late that afternoon an old
chap named Parker in bed-4
was placed on the d.-i. list
and his relatives were informed.
They arrived just before the
day staff went off-duty, and
a few minutes later Ambrose
walked in.
/'Yld Parker should have
recovered. He had been
admitted for minor surgery,
and because his heart-condi-
tion was bad the operation
had been performed under a
local anaesthetic. It was a
calculated risk, the medical
staff said, but a very small
one. Yet despite their optimism
Parker died during Sister
James's second night on duty.
“It’s a funny thing,” one
of the walking patients re-
marked after breakfast.
“Ambrose camped under old
Parker’s bed last night. You’d
almost reckon he knew there
was something doing, wouldn’t
you?”
“The poor bloody cat's gotta
camp somewhere,” another
patient reasoned. “He takes
one look at Old Battleaxe
when she walks into the
Sisters’ office and he shoots-
through. Ya can’t blame him,
can ya?”
No, the other patients
couldn’t blame him. But
since hospital patients have
very little to talk about once
they have exhausted the
absorbing topic of their
operations, they talked about
coincidence and premonitions.
Ambrose was very much in
the hospital news.
By the morning of Sister
James's third night he had
made the headlines. A third
patient had died and Ambrose
had spent the night under his
bed. Coincidence was dis-
missed now and premonition
became the generally accepted
theory: the cat knew. Some
animal instinct told him when
a man was going to die and
some equally mystic instinct
prompted him to hang around
until the end. Someone called
Ambrose the Death Cat, and
the name caught-on.
Naturally Mick heard all
about it ; baiting him by inten-
sifying his hatred for Ambrose
was a popular pastime with the
patients.
“1 knoo it!” he whined.
”1 knoo no good was gunna
come out of encouragin' a
black cat around a hospital.
Black as Ould Nick 'imself,
that’s him. There’s some
animals as can smell death or
bring it with ’em, and 'e’s one
of ’em. If I had a gun . . .”
He went off muttering threats
about getting his hands on a
gun and putting an end to this
black bringer of death.
Sister Sharon came back
next night, and Ambrose took
up his old position alongside
her desk. But his reputation
as a Death Cat lingered on.
Three deaths in three nights
and he had been in on all of
them! Say what you like, the
patients reasoned, there was
something in it.
Agreeing with fierce intensity,
Mick raved, “That there cat's a
homen o’ death and he oughta
be done away with before he
brings on more.” He w'heeled
savagely on two grinning
young walking - patients. “I
wouldn't grin if I was in your
places. One of yez might be
the next to go. Yer all in the
same ward as him, ain’t ya?
How would ya feel if ya woke
up in the night and seen him
under yer bed, eh?”
When she overheard some of
the talk about her cat Sister
Sharon’s reactions were sharp
arid scathing.

His plummet into flame and leafless beech
Questions the origin of matter and time
And spotlights the painted tin soldiers
I thrust into his nursery days.
Lichen with their silver sheets
Cover his fall into a bitter wood
And moss green grown on the broken beech
Coffins the wasteland.
1 cannot see the wood for the trees
Blowing their wild wood-wind
Over the desolation : only their rhythm
And the space between the boles
Bind them into a wood
Now that the leaves are gone
Or tie them into just and upright faggots
For the yelping dogs of war,
Or stand them still as stiff translations
Conjured from the frozen strokes
Of a tolling bell . . . These words are dreams
Tumbling, and the sand-man sings
Bidding him sleep, while the skeleton beech
Project their octaves on the snow
In criss-cross silhouettes as clef and stave
For the wood-wind song; then drowsing dreams
Transmute this black legato lace
Into a phantom cavalcade moving
Relentlessly, at celestial pace,
Forever over snow with the sun and the moon,
In a virgin elegy of heaven.

Built on a Bike
The Brace Small Story
By "OBSERVER"
The announcement in
Sydney recently of a
£5 - million real - estate
promotion at Surfers’
Paradise throws the spotlight
on a remarkable experiment in
building a city from scratch—
and on the equally remarkable
man behind the venture.
There have been other spec-
tacular promotions on the Gold
Coast since war’s end—real-
values there have jumped
from £5O a lot to £2OOO-
- and beyond but
the Paradise City venture is
easily the most audacious so
far.
Just 400 yards from the
much - publicised sands of
Surfers’, the first suburb of the
460-acre city is past the blue-
print stage and ready for home-
builders. Picturesquely tucked
into a corner of the Nerang
River, the suburb has been
named Isle of Capri. Three
other suburbs —Cannes, Sor-
rento and Riviera —are planned
and will be built progressively ;
the sum of them will
appear on the Queensland
tourist-maps as Paradise City.
Designed by overseas
planning-authority Dr. Karl
Langer, the project entails the
building of bridges, commercial
centres with supermarkets,
shops, car-parks, churches,
sporting-arenas, picnic-grounds
and arterial roads lined with
trees.
Three-million cubic-yards of
earth will raise the total acreage
above possible flood-level, and
an application of loamy top-
soil is intended to guarantee
the growth of any flora to be
found under Capricornia.
Behind the Paradise City
project is Melbourne's Bruce
Small, businessman, industrial-
ist and commercial clairvoyant.
Jn his early sixties and of
medium height, he bears a
striking resemblance to
America’s Harry S. Truman.
"Oruce Small got his start in
bicycles. That was back
in 1920, when the motor-age,
although imminent, had not yet
deposed the bicycle in popu-
larity among the sporting and
travelling public. Five-hundred
locally-made motor-cars a day
and the hire-purchase machin-
ery that keeps them moving
were to emerge in the decades
ahead, but in the ’twenties there
was still a certain leisure in
travel, as in other things.
Even so, breaking into a
well-established industry with
BRUCE SMALL
little capital and experience
called for something more than
optimism.
From Tom Finnigan, one of
cycling’s old glories and
winner of the 1898 Austral
Wheel Race, Small bought the
Malvern Star shop in Glen-
ferrie Road, Malvern. He was
hard put to raise the £2OO
deposit, and one of his first
steps on taking-over was to sell
the cash-register to' reduce the
balance.
It is an interesting commen-
tary on his qualities of leader-
ship that, despite these un-
promising beginnings, two
younger brothers and a life-
long friend threw-in their jobs
to follow wherever Bruce
Small might lead. Having no
capital, they brought none.
But ° they had abundant faith
in the young man who knew
where he was going.
OPhe friend was Hubert
Opperman, now Minister
for Shipping and Transport in
the Menzies Government but
then a young man on the
threshold of his cycling great-
ness.
The excellence of the Bruce
Small bicycle—the Malvern
Star —was soon to be impressed
on the consciousness of the
public by the feats of
Opperman. _
Bruce Small was quick—
perhaps quicker even than the
modest Opperman himself —to
see that in his young associate
he had a potential world cham-
pion. He was equally quick to
see how the abilities of his
latent champion and the
machine he manufactured
could be harnessed for the
mutual benefit of both. Just
how right he was is now his-
tory, and needs no elaboration
here.
What is interesting is Small's
boldness in taking Oppy on the
first of his overseas tours, at
once denuding the business,
which was in the throes of
growing-pains, of 50 per cent,
of its executive and of capital
it could ill afford to lose.
He was sublimely confident
of successfully matching his
man and his machine against
the best the world had to offer.
The dividends, he knew, would
come later.
'T'hose early years of Bruce
Small’s enterprise were
years of which Oppy’s feats
were indissolubly a part, with
the Malvern Star bicycle figur-
ing prominently in them.
Every now and then he and
his brilliant protege would go
abroad to seek fresh honors.
Bruce Small was to follow
Oppy by car through the
British and Continental classics,
the 3000-mile Tour de France,
Paris-Brest-Paris (Oppy won
that 726-mile race after 49 con-
secutive hours in the saddle),
and his great transcontinental
and capital-to-capital mara-
thons in Australia. Small was
at once Oppy’s friend and
mentor the man who
planned, organised, coaxed and
drove the champion from one
victory to another.
After 20 years of competi-
tive cycling, when followers of
the sport were saying that
Oppy had had enough, he
skittled 101 world, Australian
and State track-records in 24
hours at the Sydney Sports
Arena. When the war came and
Oppy went into the R.A.A.F.
he was still a champion.
To Bruce Small, Oppy paid
this tribute: “It is not difficult
to assess his influence on my
cycling—and that means my
life —so interwoven have been
the two. No performance was
complete without his presence.
I felt the maximum could not
be reached were he not on
hand.”
HThe business in Glenferrie
Road grew steadily. Three
other shops were added before
the objective of one in Mel-
bourne’s Elizabeth Street was
reached. But there was to be
no pausing there.
There was a military preci-
sion about the planning and


execution of Bruce Small’s pro-
jects—which he invested, when-
ever possible, with publicity
promotions that scornful rivals
said smacked more of show-
manship than sound business-
principle.
In this particular, at least,
they underestimated their up-
and-coming competitor. Small,
soldier-like, had evaluated the
potential of every weapon in
his arsenal and was not afraid
to use all or any of them when
they would serve his turn.
Each year brought new sales-
records —if two years of the
depression could be excepted ;
years in which the sales-
graphs levelled off, as they did
in most businesses the country
over.
Tn building the biggest organ-
-*• isation of its kind in the
Southern Hemisphere—judged
by its comprehensive activities
of manufacture, assembly,
wholesaling and retailing—
Bruce Small shook the trade
to its. very foundations.
Creative in his thinking,
imaginative in his approach
and supremely confident in his
judgment, he inevitably trod on
a few corns. The opposition
raised a chorus of angry
voices, for instance, when he
announced selling-terms then
unheard of: “£2 down and ss.
weekly.”
In these days of hire-
purchase, when one may buy,
wear or travel now and pay
later, when one may even be
buried on the most agreeable
terms, this offer would prob-
ably pass unnoticed. Back in
the ’twenties, however, it was
commercial heresy, evoking a
reaction as drastic as it was
immediate. The trade ganged-
up on Small.
The rumor went around Mel-
bourne that he was finished,
that the banks no longer
regarded him as a good risk,
that his staff were leavin’g him
for more secure employment.
Wholesalers and manufacturers
of parts refused him member-
ship of their association,
thereby cutting-off his supplies
of the multitude of parts his
factories demanded.
Th the counter-attack that fol-
lowed, Bruce Small proved
himself a fighter to be reckoned
with and a strategist of the first
order.
“I’m offering 17s. 6d. in the
pound right now to those who
are distrustful,” he announced
defiantly, “and that’s good
value from an alleged bank-
rupt. I give my absolute word
that there’s £1 for £1 waiting
for those who give me their
confidence.”
He quelled the doubters and
renewed the confidence of his
creditors.
The battle with the whole-
salers’ association dragged on
for a whole year and ended
with the association’s uncondi-
tional surrender. Small’s sales-
organisation was too strong to
be ignored.
Small, who did not like
either exposed flanks or in-
dustrial standoverism, acquired
the B.S.A. parts-franchise for
Australia a few years later.
When the war came his fac-
tories were making their own
parts. His position was un-
assailable.
In 1936, as if to give some
indication of the public con-
fidence he had won, he floated
Allied Bruce Small, Limited, as
a public company. Within 24
hours the issue was over-
subscribed by nearly £40,000.
Tt has been said of Small that,
had he not emerged as an
industrialist, he would have
made his name as a concert-
artist.
At one time he surprised
Melbourne with the quality of
his fine tenor-voice, becoming
known from numerous concert-
platforms and from broadcasts
on the national radio-stations.
When the Melbourne Phil-
harmonic Orchestra was plan-
ning a production of Mendels-
sohn’s “Elijah,” with baritone
Harold Williams in the lead,
Small was asked to take the
main tenor - part. Unfortu-
nately, the secretary of the
orchestra rang him at his office
instead of making the request
directly or in writing. Unfor-
tunately also, the secretary’s
genuine Oxford accent sounded
strangely like the affected tones
of a friend known to Small as
an expert leg-puller.
“Mr. Small,” the well-
modulated voice asked, “do you
know ‘Elijah’?”
“Very well indeed,” Small
said. “How’s he getting along
these days?”
Although the caller’s bona
fides were soon established,
pressure of business at that
time prevented Small from
accepting what he considers the
most flattering offer ever made
him.
When war came, the full
resources of his factories
were switched to war-work.
Tens of thousands of military
bicycles flowed from the
assembly-lines, and comparable
numbers for civilians immobil-
ised by petrol - rationing.
Radio-location sets, tubular
tent-frames and radio-masts
were made for the R.A.A.F.,
and ambulance-stretcher car-
riages for the A.I.F. Day and
night, through three shifts,
Bruce Small and his team made
the special lugs, jigs, tools and
dies for the new items urgently
required by the procuring-
authorities.
Although this constant and
important work demanded
much of him, it didn’t entirely
satisfy Bruce Small. He bought
365 acres of land at Tulla-
marine, near the Essendon air-
port, and embarked on the
urgent, and successful, task of
producing food for war
purposes. He lived there and
supervised the work, commut-
ing to Melbourne daily to keep
the output of his factories up
to schedule.
The farm at Tullamarine was
a gesture. It was a contribu-
tion to the war-effort which the
industrialist could make on his
own, of his own volition ; it
also provided an outlet for the
funds of energy he
seemed aways to be generating
and which a 12-hour day at
the factory did not seem to
spend.
A few years after the war
he bought 50 acres at Franks-
ton. There, in well-clovered
pastures, he keeps blood-horses
for no other reason than that
he loves a thoroughbred —
although, strangely, he has
never been on a racecourse in
his life. Even now, at 64, he
spends weekends there, work-
ing-off a week’s accumulation
of energy galloping the toey
thoroughbreds at breakneck
speeds about the countryside.
Early in 1958 Small sold his
considerable holdings in
Allied Bruce Small, Ltd., to
Electronic Industries.
At the hand-over he stood
at the head of a pros-
perous organisation that had
grown from a modest suburban
bicycle-shop to a chain of
factories and retail - stores
spread across Australia. From
retailing the Malvern Star
bicycle which Opperman and
other champions had kept, and
are keeping, prominent in
racing-circles both here and
abroad, his stores grew to carry
an enormous range of products
—refrigerators, electric home-
cleaners, radio and domestic
electrical-goods of all kinds.
'T'o. understand why Bruce
Small surrendered his
interests in the companies he
created is, to under-
stand the mainspring of the
famous sigh that historians
have ascribed to Alexander.
For Bruce Small it was not
so much a case of casting about
for new worlds to conquer as
of directing his indefatigable
energies into other channels.
Maybe his experiments at
Tullamarine and Frankston
whetted his appetite for real-
estate. Maybe he sensed that
in this field was to be found
the competition that would
challenge and stimulate a nature
such as his. Certainly he
could sense the spectacular
promotions inherent in the
post-war real-estate boom.
That flair for showmanship he
had displayed in industry could
be given full rein in the
dazzling projects he had long
since been envisaging.
TTE wasted no time, nor did
he take any tentative first
steps. He plunged into not one
but ihree of the most spectacu-
lar real-estate promotions this
country has ever seen —and he
tackled them concurrently, out-
laying a large part of his con-
siderable fortune in the
process.
On St. Kilda’s expensive
waterfront he is building Edge-
water, which will be the tallest
block of flats in Australia, con-
taining no less than 250 home-
units.
At Torquay, 14 miles from
the rapidly expanding city of
Geelong, he is opening-up the
450-acre Mt. Pleasant estate to
1800 families. He is planning
a new township on this estate
with a frontage of T| mile on
Bass Strait. Dwellers in the
suburb will have surf-side
pleasures and ready access to
places of employment in
Geelong.
At Surfers’ Paradise, as has
been mentioned, Small is build-
ing a city.
Small’s election to the presi-
dency of the Urban Land
Developers’ Association of Vic-
toria in what is virtually his
inaugural year in the field of
real-estate is a far cry from the
hostile initiation he had in
industry.
Omall is president of Vic-
toria’s Association for the
Advancement of the Blind, and
has helped liberally in promot-
ing the interests of its unfor-
tunate members. He is,
honorary treasurer and a direc-
tor of Victoria’s Y.M-C.A.,
and has been actively asso-
ciated with it for more than
30 years.

“Why They Collaborated”
Since the Korean War “brainwashing”
has become a favorite word in popu-
lar journalism. It is a powerful word,
capable of conjuring-up all sorts of
mental pictures, all of them unpleasant,
some of them so terrifying that a U.S.
Army investigation-team found that the
word itself could be dangerous to the
morale of the service.
To the uninformed it has come to imply
that the Communists have some magical
formula for treating the human brain like
a tape-recorder—erasing all previous im-
pressions and recording a brand-new set.
The danger in such a belief is obvious ; a
captured soldier may reason that, since
opposition to the technique is futile, he
may as well submit right away.
In a recent Sydney “Sun-Herald” the
term brainwashing cropped-up in three
separate articles. First it was used to
describe part of a cqurse of training intro-
duced by the Army to give officers an
idea of the kind of treatment they could
expect as prisoners in the hands of a
Communist Power. Then it was applied
to the training said to be given to Wes-
tern deserters in a Communist centre in
East Germany. Thirdly, in a statement
ascribed to a Government official in New
Guinea, it v/as reported that brainwash-
ing would be used to divert the activities
of witch-doctors in New Guinea from
evil channels to good.
Properly speaking, brainwashing im-
plies working on a man by physical and
mental torture until his personality has
been completely broken and he is no
longer capable of thinking or reasoning
for himself, but is a flesh-and-blood
automaton ; a creature of conditioned
reflexes, giving predetermined answers to
carefully posed questions. Not one of
the three “Sun-Herald” cases fits this bill.
The Australian Army officers are volun-
tarily undergoing training and the Wes-
tern deserters have chosen to embrace
Communism. Physical and mental tor-
ture don’t enter into it. A brainwashed
soldier is no good either to the West or
to the Communists. And the suggestion
that the New Guinea Administration
intends to torture witch-doctors is too
ludicrous for consideration.
Collaboration
TpHE American public received many
unpleasant shocks from Korea, but
none was more disturbing or more
chastening than the revelations of the
general conduct of U.S. prisoners in Com-
munist prison-camps. That 21 captured
American soldiers elected to remain in
China after the war is not astounding.
The figure is almost negligible in a total
involving several thousand, and it con-
trasts strikingly with the 15,000 captured
Chinese troops (out of a total of 22,000)
who chose to remain south of the demar-
cation-line when the time came for the
of prisoners. What was (and
still is) rather astounding was that one
out of every three American prisoners
was guilty of some sort of collaboration
with the enemy.
This figure, which bears no relation-
ship whatever to experience in other wars
in which U.S. forces have been engaged,
caused U.S. Army chiefs to order a
thorough investigation of all repatriated
prisoners in an attempt to find reasons
and causes for what was obviously a
wholesale breakdown of morale. Eugene
Kinkaid, one of the editors of the “New
Yorker,” was later given permission to
investigate both the investigation and the
investigators. Why They Collaborated
(Longmans; 265.) is his report on this
task, and it should be read by all service-
men and by all critics of the Army’s
toughening-up programme.
The investigation found no evidence
that brainwashing, torture or ill-treat-
ment had been used to break-down the
resistance of the prisoners, though at first
glance the high incidence of deaths in
the prison-camps seemed to support the
idea of harsh treatment. Out of 7190
U.S. prisoners, 2730 died in the camps.
This is equivalent to 38 per cent., a
higher percentage than was recorded in
prison-camps during the War of the
American Revolution, the Civil War or
in either of the World Wars, including
the Japanese prison-camps.
“Not Unbearable”
Investigation showed, however, that
conditions in‘the camps were “bad,
but not unbearable.” The diet was inade-
quate, but not sufficiently so to cause
starvation. Prisoners of other nationali-
ties, including British and Australians,
endured similar conditions and had a
much lower percentage of deaths.
Best record of all in this respect was
that of the Turkish contingent. No Turk
died in captivity despite the fact that
more than half of those captured were
wounded When they were taken prisoner.
Colonel Perry, one of the investigators,
told Kinkaid:
It is a remarkable record. All the more
so by comparison with our own. At
Death Valley, one of the temporary
prison-camps established by the Communists
in the early days of the war, into which
the sick and wounded poured for weeks
in a .steady stream, the Turks lost not
a single man out of 110 interned.
American losses during this same period
at this same camp were, we estimate, from
400 to 800 dead out of 1500 to 1800
prisoners interned.
The Turkish collaboration record was
also excellent. The investigators found
only two cases —both minor in American
eyes—and after repatriation the two men
©concerned “asked for and received from
the Army protective custody to save
them from the wrath of their com-
patriots.”
Faced with the undeniable fact that
there had been a wholesale collapse of
morale among U.S. soldiers in captivity,
the Army set-out to find the reasons.
They wanted to know how much this
was due to the weakness of the men and
how much to failure of the system of
training them.
Broadcasts and Letters
HPhe investigation was no rushed job.
Soul-searching began soon after the
outbreak of the war when U.S. prisoners
were heard broadcasting over the enemy
radio. The first such case occurred only
four days after first contact with the
enemy, when an officer captured 48 hours
previously broadcast a 900-word talk
over Seoul Radio. Similar broadcasts
followed, and after a while
the enemy began returning small groups
of captives who had been subjected to
special indoctrination, and were loaded
with propaganda leaflets, to our front
lines, trying in this way to influence our
troops to desert to Communism.
In America families began handing in
to the Army letters they had received
from prisoners “that sounded wholly
unlike the men who had written them.”
Articles signed by U.S. prisoners began
to appear in the Communist press in
India, Indonesia and other countries.
The Army inquiry began early in the
war, but the main investigation had to
wait until 1953, when the prisoners were
repatriated—l 49 in April-May (mainly
sick and wounded) and 3629 in August-
September after the armistice had been
signed. The study did not end until two
years later, and in that time nearly 4000
case-histories had been compiled and
examined.
The mildest and most common form of
collaboration consisted in broadcasting
Christmas or other messages home, such
messages invariably including a plug for
the kindly treatment experienced at the
hands of the Communists. More serious
were the many cases of writing anti-
American propaganda and informing on
fellow-prisoners. And apart from the
converts who stayed behind in China
there were others who had agreed to
work as undercover Communists after
their return to America.
brainwashing in the real sense was
used, but collaboration was secured
through “a novel blend of leniency and
pressure.” No one was tortured, but
there were plenty of threats of torture,
and these were usually sufficient to get
men to talk, either immediately or after
further threats. But the investigation
showed that where a man steadfastly re-
fused to answer any questions other than
the regulation name, rank, regimental
number and date-of-birth he was given
up as a bad job after a few bouts of
questioning.
On the other hand, if a prisoner gave
even the slightest scrap of information
other than those elementary details he
was obviously marked down as compliant
material and was hauled up again and
again for questioning and yielded more
and more.

YOUR SHOUT!
AND IT'S
RED MILL RUM.
Sfradbroke Meeting
When 100-to-l Wallgar
easily beat odds-on Fine And
Dandy in the Q.T.C. Lightning
Stakes on May 28 the majority
of southerners looked on the
win on a heavy track as a
racing fluke, and just to show
it wasn’t anything of the sort
the same Toowoomba horse —
this lime at 33’s again
downed Fine And Dandy, with
Hianthus third, in the Strad-
broke. To drive the lesson home
thoroughly, the going last Satur-
day was firm. Wallgar could
prove a real sprinting find, with
an excellent chance in any race
up to seven furlongs or so.
The Stradbroke was his third
in a row ; he had also scored
at Toowoomba on April 2.
A four-year-old gelding by
Ungar from Sister Pat, he is'
raced and was bred by F. A.
Wall, of Dalby, and is trained
by T. S. Doyle. Ungar was
a smart sprinter on Melbourne
courses ; as a two-year-old he
won six races on end, includ-
ing the V.R.C. Sires’ Produce
Stakes. Later he won the
Doomben Ten Thousand. He
has had many winners on
Brisbane tracks.
It’s hard to say just how
much Tulloch would have won
by now if he hadn’t been off
the scene for the best part
of two years through illness ;
as it is, his exercise gallop in
the P. J. O’Shea Stakes at
Saturday’s Q.T.C. meeting
brought his total earnings to
£73,768, for 26 firsts, seven
seconds, and one third from
34 starts. His only opponents
in the Brisbane middle-
distance w.-f.-a. event were
Macdougal and Book Link,
good handicappers, but no
match for Tulloch under these
conditions. The champion
will be rested until it is time
to begin his spring training.
He will then race in w.-f.-a.
events and also in the Mel-
bourne Centenary Cup if he
does well. and isn’t given the
grandstand to carry.
Locally trained three-year-
olds contested the Queensland
St. Leger, a soft snap for
Countwood, who’s closely re-
lated to crack Brisbane per-
former Earlwood. Raced by
his breeder, W. J. Jones, he’s a
gelding by Boxwood (imp.)
from Honey Buzz by The
Buzzard (imp.) from Saccharine
by Highfield (imp.) from Black
Sugar by Kenilworth (imp.),
tracing back on the dam’s side
to Carbine, so the classic
winner has a real staying back-
ground.
* * *
At Randwick
Apparently the two-year-old
Port Vista colt Port Bound
was sharpened-up by his mid-
week run at Canterbury Park.
He finished then a long way
back, but he fairly easily won
the A.J.C. Juvenile Novice at
Randwick on Saturday. His
dam, Flood Bound, was got
by Precept from Spanola by
“You break the news to him. You re bigger than me.”
Bullhead (imp.) from Tango
Lass by Redfern (imp).
With much better form,
Rimyll, second on two recent
occasions, also broke through
at Randwick, proving too
solid for Milagre and Paddles
in the 10-furlongs Balmoral
Novice.. A three-year-old
Judicate (imp.) gelding, Rimyll
was bred by R. E. Miller and
reared at Kia-Ora Stud, Scone
(N.S.W.), and was a second
foal of his dam, Friendly Feel-
ing, a Delville Wood (imp.)
mare from Platonic, and winner
of, among other races, the
James Barnes Plate at Rand-
wick.
After a series of disappoint-
ing displays, three-year-old
filly Belle Pan was yet another
to find Randwick to her liking,
winning the St. Aubins
Maiden for fillies and mares.
She was solidly backed from
20’s to B’s. Mrs. J. Denham
is racing the filly, who was
bred by Alec Higgins and is
trained at Canterbury Park by
Jack Denham. Higgins, who
has the Piercefield Stud at
Muswell brook (N.S.W.), also
bred Belle Pan’s dam, Belle
Fille, a Beau Pere (imp.) mare
from Merry Smile by Chatham
by Merri Merrigal by Valais
(imp.). , So there’s plenty of
speed in the breeding.
In most of Grecian Vale’s
previous nine wins he had been
ridden by apprentices, and on
Saturday trainer G. McCahon
gave the mount to Peter Miers,
who brought the weight down
from 8.1 to 7.10 for an easy
win in the June Stakes, with
Great Blaze and New Stand
in the places. Other appren-
tices to win on Grecian Vale
have included K. Parkinson,
R. Wilton,- S. Farrawell and
J. Coffey.
Though that good six-year-
old mare Tranquilette hadn’t
won since last July she had
shown improving form at starts
leading up to her success in
the A.J.C. Ellesmere Handicap
at Randwick. She was made
favorite accordingly, and
apprentice C. Underhill held
her together well for her win-
ning dash to the line. She may
not do much more racing, since
intentions are to send her to
the stud. As well as being one
of the best lookers of her sex
in training, she is very well
bred, being by stayer Howe
from Tranquil Queen by Sir
Calidore (imp.) from Exaggera-
tion (imp.) by Politan.
• * • •
Winchester, who has won
round about a dozen races,
showed a return to his best
form in beating the favorite,
Ramazan, and Gay Crag in
the Botany Welter. Scoring
his third win at Randwick, he
was another capably handled
by an apprentice—H. Trenear,
who had also won five times
earlier on the smart sprinter.
Clear Profit’s penalty for win-
ning at Canterbury three days
earlier beat him, but Aggres-
sive ran well enough to jot
down for an early win.
• • • •
Albert McKenna, son of
recently retired Neil McKenna,
led in his first winner when
Scottish Inn defeated Family
Pride and Bold Emperor in the
First Belmore Stakes at the
midweek Canterbury Park
meeting—and the veteran, who
hadn’t been known to show
much excitement over any of
his own, cheered the younger
generation’s winner to the post
like a five-bob punter. Among
his own notable winners Neil
McKenna trained Palbi, who
landed the 1925 Australian
steeplechase, and Double
Blank, who won a Summer
Cup at Randwick for him.
Scottish Inn is a four-year-old
entire by Wayside Inn (imp.)
from Highland Charm by Em-
borough (imp.) from Coax by
Magpie (imp.).

Towards the Nationals
Weights are out for the
Nationals, with French Master,
11.6, top of the Hurdle entries,
and Tranquil Glow, 11.10,
heading the Steeple weights.
They are close to favorite for
their respective events. Last
year’s Hurdle winner, Hill-
wood, has got in well with
10.7, and he has received
heavy backing in the last
week. Since 1950 six of the
Hurdle winners have carried
under 10.0, and there are
some good prospects in that
division again this year,
including Asprey, 9.13, and
Fair Counsel and Regal Copy,
both with 9.6. The heavy-
weights have a better record
in the Steeple, and Tranquil
Glow is certainly not handi-
capped out of the race.
Mudeet, 10.5, and Grand
Reward, 9.12, appeal for the
Steeple at this stage.

It is very doubtful if the
winner of either National was
seen at Flemington last Satur-
day. Unhindered, a first-year
hurdler who is not entered for
the National, won the York
Hurdle so easily that none
of the horses that finished
behind him would appear to
have any chance in the big
race next month. Unhindered
is New Zealand-bred (by
Fair’s Fair from Frustration)
and has taken to the jumping
business most successfully.
From three starts over the
sticks he has recorded a second
and then two wins. At one
stage of the York he was at
least 100yds. clear of his
nearest opponent, and he only
coasted home to win by 15
lengths. There was a time
when Unhindered found it
difficult to run five furlongs;
now he looks a likely type for
the Australian Hurdle.
Sol David, now nine, has
been battling around in steeple-
chases for years, with his
successes as far apart as
townships on the Nullarbor.
He is in the National with
only 9.6 (41b. less than he
carried in winning the Hope-
toun Steeple on Saturday), but
he does not make much appeal
in the big race. A better
prospect is Billowing Sails,
owned by a quartet of pro-
minent Melbourne newspaper-
men. Billowing Sails is bred
well enough to win anything,
being by Bob Cherry (imp.)
from Canvas Back (imp.), the
dam of Kingster and Royal
Artist. He finished on solidly
for second behind Sol David,
and may have some chance
in the National with 9.6.
One of the most popular
races the V.R.C. stages in the
course of the year is the
Provincial Plate, first run in
1956. of the race
state that it is for three-year-
olds and over who have started
at least four times outside a
radius of 50 miles of the G.P.O.
of the capital city of any State
within 12 months of the
date of entry, and who have
not won a metropolitan race
within two years of the same
date ; starters to carry a
weight set according to age
and y sex. Entries were so
numerous this year that the
Plate had to be run in three
divisions.
Gold Book had won a
Welter at Caulfield since
entries were taken, so it was
not surprising he started at
evens for the first heat of the
Plate. He won easily. He is
raced by his breeder, Albury
railwayman K. Dickenson,
and trained by Wangaratta
mentor Hal Hoysted. It was
Gold Book’s fourth win in a
row, and he has earned the
spell he will now enjoy.

George’s Terrace, Perth, Solicitor for the
Plaintiff.
Gorman, who uses the nom-
de-course of “G. Ornong,”
owns Prince of Baghdad,
winner by an inch or two of
the second division. Prince of
Baghdad is by the French
horse Djafar from Mizar, the
dam of Rimfire, who won the
Melbourne Cup of 1948 for
another V.R.C. committeeman,
Guy Raymond. Barham
Duke, third Plate winner,
comes from the Warrackna-
beal district, and is owned in
partnership by Mrs. K. Wood-
head, J. McCarthy and K.
Ryan, who trains the gelding.
Barham Duke’s sire, Iron
Duke, won the Caulfield
Guineas in 1949. Leading
jockey Geoff Lane had the
tough luck to be on the second
horse in each of the three
divisions.
It was a bad day for punfers’
blood-pressure at Flemington.
There were three photo-
finishes, all decided by a short
half-head (perhaps 3in.) and all
in favor of the bookmakers.
In the first of them French
Master, who successfully mixes
flat-racing with hurdling, got
the verdict from Nether Gold,
the favorite, in the 12-furlongs
Sandringham Handicap.
Rather surprisingly, entries
for the £25,000 Centenary Mel-
bourne Cup were nowhere near
the 1948 record of 541. From
all States and New Zealand
the total of entries is 457. De-
spite the rich prize, many
owners of moderate horses
would seem to have baulked at
the increased nomination-fee
of £5 (previously £2). The
New Zealand entry of 33, how-
ever, is a record from the
Dominion, Tulloch is in, and
the big question is what weight
he will get. He may be asked
to break Carbine’s weight-
carrying record of 10.5. Last
year’s winner, Macdougal, has
been nominated. The V.A.T.C.
has received 431 nominations
for the Caulfield Cup, 30 less
than the record established in
1948.

“LAL”: Sydney soccer hasn’t
got it entirely on its own. In
the seventh V.F.L. round there
were enough brawls to change
the title to Victorian Fighting
Legions. A‘t ESsendon home-
side supporters attacked field-
umpire Frank Schwab after
Melbourne had downed their
idols by the bare two points.
One 19-year-old was charged
with assaulting Schwab. At the
Collingwood v. North Mel-
bourne encounter things got
really willing, and sundry
youths were charged with
attacking a police officer, who
was taken to hospital with con-
cussion. In the official bout,
Norths surprised Collingwood,
14-88. Footscray (81) thrashed
Richmond (49), Souths beat
Carlton 91-79, and Hawthorn
clinched it with the last kick of
the day against Geelong, 14.15-
14.13. Two hairline finishes
last Saturday were St. Kilda s
13.14-13.12 defeat of Norths,
and Fitzroy’s one-point win
over Souths, 13.13-13.12. Mel-

bourne, Essendon, Hawthorn
and Collingwood were the other
winners.

“SAS”: Allen Aylett, Vic-
torian and North Melbourne
rover, isn’t likely to forget the
match against Collingwood. It
was his 150 th match for
Norths, who won it narrowly.
In the shindy Aylett took a
savage pasting; then had the
consolation of being selected
as best player on the ground.
At the end of hostilities he was
carried shoulder-high from the
field by jubilant players and
supporters; then collapsed in
the dressing-room. When he
came to he was informed by
officials that he’d been reported
for attempting to kick a Col-
lingwood player ; this time he
had the dual consolation of
being found not guilty and
afterwards being chosen in the
Vic. team to play South Aus-
tralia !

“Aussie Rules”: Usually it’s
a hard road several years long
before a V.F.L. player gets into
the inter-State team. This time
two colts —Alistair Lord (Gee-
long) and John Winneke (Haw-
thorn) —have made it in their
first full season of senior foot-
ball ! Lord, a half-forward,
hails from the country town of
Cobden ; Winneke, son of Vic-
torian Solicitor - General Sir
Henry Winneke, Q.C., origin-
ally played with University
Blacks.
* * *
“Lai”: Carlton, finalists of
the V.F.L. last year, have
slumped badly this year and
have been down on the third
rung. Coach Ken Hands, ex-
tremely disappointed at his
team’s poor showings, was
asked why the bad form? Said
Hands, “How can you possibly
infuse brains into monu-
ments?” That ought to pep
the boys up a little.

Before a crowd of just under
50,000 the French Rugby
Leaguers held Australia to an
8-all draw in the first Test,
played at the Sydney Cricket
Ground last Saturday. From
the kick-off the French for-
wards showed more willingness
to mix it than they had done
earlier, and at the whistle
they were right on top of the
Australian pack. The result,
no doubt, was well received in
both camps—good gates are
now assured for the remain-
ing two Tests.
** ■ *
“Keima”: There are two
Lacazes, unrelated, in the
French Rugby League team.
Fullback Pierre Lacaze, one of
the stars of the side, is France’s
top goalkicker, and regularly
drops field-goals (though he
missed a couple of easy ones
against N.S.W.). He also at
times drop-kicks at penalties.
His namesake, Andre, is a
lock-forward, and also kicks
goals. In the opening game of
the tour, against Monaro
here at Canberra, he kicked
five goals, including a lovely
dropped goal from a fair way
out.
* * *
“Mitron” (Bris.): Some of
them certainly do last at
Soccer —like veterans Bob
Lawrie and Alec Duncan, who
hold regular places in the
Bundamba Rangers First
Division team. Lawrie first
represented Queensland over
20 years ago and toured South
Africa as captain of the Aus-
tralian team in 1950. Duncan,
ex-Queensland captain, was a
member of the 1948 Australian
team which visited N.Z. The
Rangers club itself is in the
veteran class —vintage 1886.
*l* * *
After all the fuss and
feathers, Tony Madigan dis-
posed of Queenslander Ken
Marshall even more convinc-
ingly than perhaps Ken’s con-
siderably vocal supporters may
have feared. It was all over —
per k.o. —in a round, with the
game loser never looking other
than darned unlucky to have
been flung into it. So at least
one first-rate scrapper will
rep. for Australia at the
Olympics—in the light-heavies.
Other Olympic challenge win-
ners in a lively evening’s stoush
were: Flyweight: Rocky Gat-
tellari (N.S.W.) outpointed
Noel Kunde (Q.); Bantam :
Ollie Taylor (Q.) outpointed
Billy Males (N.S.W.); Feather :

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
CHINESE WAR-CRIES
Did China really have any-
thing to do with Khrush-
chev’s sudden change of
front in Paris? In London
“Observer” Guy Wint notes
that, although there is no solid
evidence, “certain facts are
public and suggestive.”
These facts are two long
articles in “Red Flag” (the
theoretical organ of the Cen-
tral Committee of the Chinese
Communist party) and two in
“People’s Daily” (the party’s
main daily paper). Ostensibly
published as part of the April
celebrations of the 90th anni-
versary of Lenin’s birth, the
articles contained a Govern-
ment analysis of the world
situation. “They were, in
fact,” notes Wint, “a polemic
against Mr. Khrushchev’s co-
existence policy, though they
did not name him or his
policies directly”:
“Their main theme was that
as long as ‘imperialism’ con-
tinues, wars of all kinds are
inevitable. These may take
the form of local wars or of
world-wide nuclear war. The
Chinese, quoting Lenin, regard
war as the apex of the his-
torical processes which bring
in Communism. The last
resort of imperialism will be
to try to divide the Communist
countries by fomenting ‘re-
visionism,’ and this, said the
articles, is happening now.
“The articles were violent
about President Eisenhower.
One of them protested at the
idea that he might ‘drop his
butcher’s-knife arid be turned
into a Buddha.’ Another
listed 34 hostile acts by him and
Mr. Herter against the Com-
munist world since the meet-
ing at Camp David.
“In spite of this, the ‘Red
Flag’ articles said formally
that China welcomed the
Summit Meeting. But in the
context of the articles the
welcome sounded peculiarly
hollow.
Moscow Replies
“The attacks by Peking went
home sufficiently for Moscow
to reply. On April 22, again
in connection with the 90th
anniversary of Lenin’s birth,
Moscow put-up Mr. Kuusinen.
He is a laureated theoretician,
and a member of the all-
powerful Secretariat. In the
past he has evolved Com-
munist policy for the Negro
problem in America ; in 1939
he was groomed as Communist
gauleiter for Finland.
“On this occasion he made
a speech which encouraged
optimism about the Summit.
‘lt is not enough,’ he said,
‘to repeat the old truth that
imperialism is aggressive.
The task is to make full use
of the new factors acting for
peace to save mankind from
the catastrophes of a new
war. A dogmatic position is
an obsolete position.’ War,
with the new weapons of
destruction, would be mad-
ness ; and it was not inevit-
—London “Daily Mail."
“WISH I KNEW HOW THIS DAMN’ THING WORKS ...”
able. He insisted that Lenin,
except in the days of civil war
and intervention, had been
the champion of peaceful
coexistence.
“Between the date of Mr.
Kuusinen’s speech and the
Paris meeting something must
have happened to tilt Russia
away from its willingness to
negotiate with the West, and
to tilt it towards the Chinese
intransigence. This something
may have been that the
Chinese propaganda, or Chinese
diplomatic activity, converted
the more powerful associates
of Mr. Khrushchev. Or it may
have been that the Chinese
arguments provided those who
disliked Mr. Khrushchev’s
plans for the Summit with a
weapon which Mr. Khrush-
chev could not parry, and in
face of which he thought it
better to give way. He may
have accepted the need to keep
solidarity in the Communist
world. In the course of debate
in the Secretariat or the
Presidium the Chinese theses
may have been decisive, even
though a suggestion that the
Chinese were dictating Rus-
sian policy would have been
resented, and would have
played into Mr. Khrushchev’s
hands.
“It cannot be proved that
this is what happened. But
it would fit in with what is
known. The resemblance
between the new Khrushchev
policy, as displayed in Paris,
and the policy and ideology
of the ‘Red Flag' is too close
not to have some significance.”
China Profits
London “Economist,” re-
viewing the descent from the
Summit, makes the further
point that “the one Power
that has decisively profited
from the Paris failure is
“Mr. Mao has seen at a
stroke the fulfilment of his
pre-Summit wish that, after
the U-2 affair, ‘those people
who described Mr. Eisenhower
as a man of peace would now
be awakened by the facts.’
Peking has become shrill in
its denunciations of the ‘trick
peace’: the Chinese argu-
ments for priority in the dis-
tribution of Soviet economic
aid and for revolutionary
activity among the neutral
Powers may be listened to
with all the more respect by
some quarters in Moscow.
“The greatest danger is that
the failure in Paris, if it were
followed by a break-down in
the nuclear talks at Geneva,
might finally prompt a favor-
able Soviet answer to Chinese
demands for a nuclear armory.
Of all the major Powers,
China alone professes d philo-
sophy of atomic war, and it
has the cause —in Formosa —-
to start one. The risk is evi-
dent that Peking may use its
first bomb to paralyse the
Nationalist regime, in the
belief that the United States
would hesitate to start a
general nuclear conflict.
“It is not in Mr. Khrush-
chev's visible interest to give
his Chinese allies this blank
cheque for oblivion. But his
resistance to pressure is bound
to be weakened if there is no
prospect of a workable
arrangement on nuclear
weapons with the West.”
A source of Chinese aggres-
siveness is indicated by Richard
L. Walker, an American scholar
j n the held of Chinese studies,
, n a long article in London
“Encounter'' about the cult that
has grown-up around the per-
sonality of Mao Tse-tung.
Mao: “Military First”

Walker paints Mao as a man
whom power and praise have
rendered “mentally incapable
of balanced judgment,'’ and
argues that “many of the recent
Chinese policies and pro-
grammes make sense only when
viewed within the framework
of Mao’s limitations.” One of

these limitations is that “Mao
is a ‘military first’ man”:
“His career and power have
been built primarily by military
means. The Long March and
subsequent long years of war
reinforced his sense of destiny
and conviction that the repre-
sentatives of the outworn ‘bour-
geois and feudal classes’ are
‘paper tigers’ without the will
to fight. More than half his
top associates are military men
who share Mao's conviction
that the ‘central task and
highest form of revolution is
to seize political power by
force, to solve problems by
war.’
“Though_ others prefer to
talk of American policy, cor-
ruption, or social ills in China,
Mao himself attributes his vic-
tory over the Nationalists to
military skill and the mobilisa-
tion of the masses.
“The Chinese leader has
restored armed violence to
Marxism with all its original
crudeness. According to Peking
in May, 1958, the military
writings of chairman Mao were
made part of the regular cur-
riculum of the national military
academy for the first time. The
chairman’s military writings
have been proclaimed the basis
for the future development of
Chinese Communist armed
forces; they stress the relation
of war and politics. In his
Problems of War and Strategy,
Mao wrote:
Every Communist must grasp the
truth: “Political power grows out
of the barrel of a gun.” Our
principle is that the party com-
mands the gun, and the gun wilt
never be allowed to command the
party.... we can even say that the
whole world can be re-moulded
only with the gun. As we are
advocates of the abolition of war,
we do not desire war; but war
can only be abolished through war
—in order to get rid of the gun,
we must first grasp it in our hand.
“Mao’s militaristic bent and
belief in the value of war for
the attainment of Communist
goals must stir serious mis-
givings among Soviet leaders.
This may help to explain recent
caution in Soviet aid to the
Chinese Communists and Mos-
cow’s failure to provide Mao
with missiles and atomic
weapons.
“The Great Simplifier”
“The cult of the leader built
around Mao Tse-tung, the great
simplifier, is too portentous to
be passed over by any of the
world’s leaders, or by his more
knowledgeable and balanced
Chinese colleagues. It is pos-
sible that his increasing physical
and mental infirmity may facili-
tate his being eased to one side,
but unfortunately under the
cult of the individual contests
for power are usually decided
in terms of who supports and
pleases the leader most.
“The world is thus faced with
a rapidly industrialising and in
creasingly powerful China
directed by an inadequately in-
formed and little - travelled
despot who has long had a
conviction of destiny and in-
fallibility and whose cult may
well drive him to an extreme
megalomania. This prospect
probably causes greatest con-
sternation among the Soviet
colleagues whose ideology Mao
Tse-tung claims to represent.
They undoubtedly prefer to
have their Hunanese peasant
standard-bearer armed with a
hoe rather than an atom-
bomb.”
Russian Oil
T> eports that Russia has
offered to supply crude
oil to India at prices substan-
tially below world level must,
the Manchester “Guardian”
notes, “have made the Western
oil-producers prick-up their
ears”:
“If Mr. Khrushchev
decided to carry-out his threat
of a massive Soviet offensive
in the underdeveloped coun-
tries, the supply of cheap oil
might be one of his principal
weapons. After the war-time
devastation of its oilfields,
Russia’s output of oil has
been growing rapidly in recent
years; Russia accounted for
a third of the total increase
in world oil-production last


year. The current Seven-Year
Plan provides for a doubling
of the rate of oil-extraction by
1965; if this is achieved a
sizeable surplus would become
available for export.
“A network of pipelines is
being developed which will
provide relatively cheap trans-
port to the Baltic ports as well
as supply oil to the countries
of Eastern Europe.
“In recent years the Scan-
dinavian countries and also
Japan and Egypt have been
importing fair amounts of
Soviet oil. Last year the first
shipments of Russian fuel-oil
since the war arrived in this
country [Britain]. But the
effort to expand export sales
is handicapped by a lack of
refining-capacity in the Soviet
Union and of marketing facili-
ties in overseas markets where
the established oil-companies
—not unnaturally—have been
reluctant to handle Russian
oil.
“Now there are reports that
some of the petrol which is
being sold in this country by
independent distributors, at
prices substantially below
those of the leading market
brands, originates from Rus-
sian crude-oil refined on the
Continent.
“Even if this is true, the
amount that is arriving in this
way is probably still quite
small. But the major oil-
producers, who already face
serious marketing-problems of
their own, are bound to be
alarmed by any suggestion
that the Soviet Union is find-
ing new outlets for its oil in
their traditional markets.”
Tito Slated
A>Carshal Tito of Yugo-
slavia has again come
under Soviet fire—this time
for his critical attitude towards
Russian, as well as U.S., con-
duct over the Summit and for
expressing doubts as to whether
any of the great Powers really
wanted an agreement.
A recent issue of “Kom-
munist,” the theoretical
journal of the Soviet Com-
munist party, contained an
article on Yugoslavia which
the “New York Times”
describes as yet another dose
of “all the old arguments which
have been so tirelessly reiterated
by the Chinese this past year,
but which had for the most
part been conspicuously miss-
ing from the Soviet press.
“Tito is allegedly aiding
imperialism. He rejects the
‘need for solidarity among the
Socialist countries.’ His ideas
represent a ‘distortion of
advanced revolution ary
theories.’ Stalin would have
been proud of his pupils who
wrote this attack.
“The Soviet theoreticians,
and presumably Premier
Khrushchev, are annoyed that
President Tito did not fail
immediately into line with
Moscow in his evaluation of
the U-2 plane incident. They
find it insufferable that a
Socialist country like Yugo-
slavia —by Khrushchev’s admis-
sion in the past—should
regard the cause of world
peace and relaxation of ten-
sion as more important than
exploitation of a
single incident in the espionage
war.
“We may suspect that part
of Moscow’s anger results
—London “Daily Herald.”
THE MILLS OF GOD GRIND SLOWLY.. .
from knowledge that Tito was
not the only important
Marxist in the world who was
appalled by Moscow’s conduct
on the plane incident, even
though he may have been the
only one in a position to speak
out. The attack on Tito, we
may be sure, is an attack on
every Communist leader in
Eastern Europe and else-
where who really believes in
world peace and who nurtures
hopes for real independence
of action for his country.”
Dragnet Digest
Barcelona correspondent of
London “Economist”: “General
Franco’s visit to Barcelona has
confounded the sensationalists.
Before his arrival at least three
different stories had reached
here from Madrid, all purport-
ing to come from the usual
well-placed sources. One was
that General Franco was to
meet General de Gaulle some-
where off the Catalan coast.
There has been no evidence of
this meeting, and it is difficult
to see when it could have been
fitted in. Another was that
General Franco was suffering
from a severe illness and had
gone to undergo treatment by
a Barcelona specialist. What-
ever the truth about the
Caudillo’s health, he carried-
out a full programme and he
looked tanned and fit. The
story that caused most interest
was that he would announce
his retirement and a decision
about his successor. He made
no such announcement, and, in
a fighting speech to the people
of Gerona, declared that he
would continue on his present
course and that the opposition
abroad could hope for no
changes.”

“Le Monde’’ (Paris): “If it
seems likely that the Kremlin
is not thinking of provoking a
crisis in the coming months, it
is impossible to foresee what
will happen once the new Presi-
dent of the United States is
installed.
“What is new in Soviet policy
is the attitude the Soviets seem
to be taking toward this elec-
tion and how they intend to
make use of it. Until now the
Soviets tended not to differenti-
ate the Republicans from the
Democrats. And they seemed
to prefer the party of ‘big
business’ (Republicans), with
whom it was always possible
to make a deal, rather than the
Opposition. Mr. Khrushchev’s
visit to the United States
showed this up: he got on very
well with the capitalists and
very poorly with the represen-
tatives of trade-unions.
“Everything goes to show
[since the Summit collapse] that
he would like to avert Mr.
Nixon’s election at all cost,
which would in his eyes prevent
a Soviet-American rapproche-
ment. But there are no assur-
ances that, if Mr. Kennedy or
Mr. Stevenson became the next
President, they would lend
themselves to another Summit
Conference without serious
guarantees.”

Columnist Michael Frayne,
in Manchester “Guardian”:
“An Argentinian sculptor called
Guyla Kosice has been charged
£75 duty by the Customs at
London Airport on his
‘hydraulic sculptures,’ because
the Customs held that the sculp-
tures—waterfilled constructions
of plastic which were on their
way to be exhibited in London
—were not works of art but bits
of plumbing.
“I must congratulate her
Majesty’s Customs and Excise
on this sharp piece of revenue-
gathering. They have British
public opinion solidly behind
them. ‘This foreign muck
would make any decent Eng-
lishman sick.’ declared Aider-
man E. J. Thudge, of Screwe
(Staffordshire), who last year
had Lady Windermere’s Fan
removed from Screwe public
library because he thought it
was the sequel to Lady Chat-
terley’s Lover. ‘I have not seen
these things, but I am told they
are completely unclothed. For
years the people of this country
have been disgusted by the sight
of nude statues. Are we now
to have nude plumbing as
well?’ ”

“When Fidel Castro overthrew
the Batista dictatorship in
Cuba one of the first acts of

“Nothing is left of these high

/Communist interrogation was
systematic and thorough,
and it followed the pattern set
by the Russians in World War
11. Military information was
only a minor part of its aims;
the more important objective
seemed to be to get the prisoner
to reveal as much as possible
about himself. The ultimate
purpose was indoctrination,
with the purpose of under-
mining the prisoner’s faith in
his country and, if possible, to
convert him to Communism.
Prisoners who were at all com-
pliant were subjected to follow-
up indoctrination throughout
the whole period of their im-
prisonment.
By insisting on drawing the
distinction between “indoctrina-
tion” and “brainwashing” the
American authorities were not
merely splitting hairs.
Brainwashing was first used
to secure confessions from the
“Old Bolsheviks” in the, Mos-
cow treason trials of the 1930’5.
By means of it the victims were
condemned out of their own
mouths so that they could be
exterminated with full legal
formalities. Indoctrination -is
defined as an effort to change
a man’s viewpoint while he is
still a thinking individual by
regulating his thoughts and
actions. Its purpose is not to
condemn a man but to use him.
And the enemy didn’t merely
want to use its “converts” while
they remained prisoners; a
man’s usefulness could continue
after his return to his own
country if doubts as to the
merits of its form of govern-
ment had been sown in his
mind and if arguments for
Communism had been pre-
sented to him far more logic-
ally and convincingly than any-
one had ( ever tried to explain
Democracy.
The investigators found that
young soldiers had collaborated
more willingly and with less
persuasion than older men;
also that less-educated men fell
more easily than those with
more schooling.
Some of them had not gone
beyond the fifth grade in our
schools. But when they returned
to the United States they had
acquired a wealth of information
about Marxism.
indoctrination was carried
A out by repetition, harass-
ment and humiliation. The
first is self-explanatory. Harass-
ment consisted of “riding’’ a
man for minor mistakes or
lack of attention. For the one
“offence" he might be lectured
half-a-dozen times —and always
at inconvenient times. He
might be wakened in the middle
of the night or called away
from the latrines for a wigging.
Humiliation followed a similar
pattern: abuse in front of
class-mates; public apologies;
self-criticism; criticism of and
by class-mates; encouragement
to inform on other prisoners.
The ironic thing about all
this is that prisoners collabor-
ated in the hope of getting
better conditions, but actually
they fared worse than those
who refused to play-along with
the Communists. Their rations
were no better and their class-
room life induced a flabbiness
that unfitted them for prison-
camp rigors. Non-collabora-
tors, put to hard work, stood -
up to deficiency-diseases much
better—and didn’t have to
suffer harassment or humilia-
tion.
Biggest admission the Army
had to make was that morale
broke down even before cap-
ture, with the result that men
threw-in their hand too easily.
At one point early in the cam-
paign 400 men surrendered in
a body.
The investigators were forced
to the conclusion that easy sur
renders, high incidence of
deaths in the camps and high
incidence of collaboration all
sprang from the same source.
The young soldiers of the post-
World War II years had things
made too easy for them and
were too soft for the demands
of combat under such condi-
tions as were met with in
Korea. Their training was
probably right enough for a
victorious walkover. It was
useless for a fighting with-
drawal, and it purposely
omitted any suggestion that an
American soldier might ever
find himself in an enemy prison-
camp.
Asa result of the investiga-
tion the U.S. Government
issued a Code of Conduct for
its armed forces. This told all
servicemen what was expected
of them in time of war, both
in battle and in the event of
capture. In addition, the men
are now being taught what to
expect and how to act if they
should be taken prisoner. An
essential point so many U.S.
prisoners forgot (or did not
know) is that a p.o.w. is still a
soldier and should not regard
the war as being over from the
moment of his capture.
The history of World War II
(and most other wars) abounds
with stories of men of both
sides who escaped from prison-
camps. Not one U.S. prisoner
escaped from his Communist
captors. K.nkaid relates that
on being asked why he had
made no attempt to get away,
one returned prisoner said,
“Well, there was trouble if you
left camp, because you had to find
a Chinese soldier to bring you back.
They wouldn’t let you back inside
the lines unless a Chinese soldier
brought you. And sometimes you
couldn’t find a Chinese soldier.”
It would have been useless to
try to wash that collaborator's
brain.
newspaper, the defence became
a criticism of the regime,
which is not to be tolerated.
“Another newspaper critical
of the Government, the ‘Diario
de la Marina,’ was seized May
10. In both cases the papers
were taken over by employees.
“The wheel has just about
come full circle. Batista paved
the way to his own downfall
with oppression that included
the stifling of all criticism.
Castro is clamping-down on
opposition with a fervor that
equals Batista’s at his worst.”
* * *
C. L. Sulzberger, in “New
York Times’’: “Today we [the
West] often have to deal with
philosophically unsatisfactory
regimes because their diploma-
tic objectives run parallel to
ours. The task for the next
decade is subtly to moderate or
help replace such Governments
with others more truly suited to
our concepts of democracy.
But the gentle revolution musl
be accomplished without ever
affording the chance that a
more deadly form of dictator-
ship—that of Communism —
might benefit. This delicate
task calls for infinite wisdom
and restraint.”

Roscoe Drummond, in
New York “Herald Tribune”:
“Given the tragedy of the
Paris Summit, it is my judg-
ment that Khrushchev hurt
himself in nearly every part of
the world by his brutal and
frontal assault on President
Eisenhower and his abuse of
the Summit as a rostrum for
crass propaganda.
“Khrushchev played his
hand so badly that he lost
support among neutral nations
and failed wholly to split the
Western allies. Even Nehru
has criticised K.’s ‘angry
approach,’ and de Gaulle and
Macmillan, as one American
official put it, ‘stood mar-
vellously firm with the Presi-
dent.’ Khrushchev began by
trying to flatter and cajole de
Gaulle and Macmillan and
ended by condemning them
for ‘subservience’ to the U.S.
and for ‘lack of independent
will.’ ”
* * ■»
Mr. Menzies: “The new
[British] Commonwealth would
disintegrate if we affected to
discuss and decide what we
thought to be the proper
measure of democracy in our
various countries. We are not
a court. We are brothers in a
special international family.
We have done so well so far
because we have nurtured our
elements of unity with loving
care and have sought to resolve
our differences in a friendly
and mutually helpful way.”

got something else to talk
about,” she snapped. “You’re
worse than a pack of old
women. The cat likes com-
pany and he was missing me.
Anyone with a scrap of sense
would realise that.”
And since there were no
more deaths in the ward the
morbid discussions were gradu-
ally dropped and the name,
Death Cat, forgotten, except
by Mick.
Ten days after Sharon’s
scathing outburst he com-
plained of severe pains in the
stomach.
YjGBEN the Medical Superin-
tendent examined him, he
told him he had a mild attack
of appendicitis, and removed
his appendix that afternoon.
Mick woke up in Ward
Three. According to the day
staff when they handed over
to Sister Sharon his condition
was quite satisfactory. He had
been complaining ever since he
became fully conscious, a sure
sign that he was normal. None
of the staff had expected Mick
to be anything other than a
difficult patient. If he had
stopped grousing they would
have felt alarmed.
At eleven o’clock Sharon
made her rounds and listened
to Mick’s complaint that he
couldn’t sleep because the paih
was so terrible.
“All right,” she said. “I’ll
give you something to settle you
down.”
She prepared a routine
morphia injection, came back
"No, thanks , I'm in a hurry."
and placed the dish containing
syringe and swab on the locker
beside his bed. Mick watched
her every movement with sus-
picion. No one was going to
do anything to him without his
knowledge and consent. He
didn’t trust these blasted nurses,
trained or otherwise.
The light from Sharon's
torch flickered over the tray and
illuminated her white uniform.
It also lit-up the moving tip
of Ambrose’s erect tail. For-
getting his pain Mick leaned
over, staring downwards in
horror as Ambrose vanished
under his bed.
“The Death Cat! ” he gasped.
“The bloody Death Cat! It’s
gone under me bed.”
“Sshh,” Sharon reproved.
“Stop making such a noise.
You’ll wake the other patients.”
But Mick cared nothing for
the other patients or for
Sharon’s subdued authority.
“The Death Cat!” he moaned.
“Holy Mother o’ God, I’m
done for! Take it away, take
it away.”
“Mick," stop making that
racket and behave yourself.”
Sharon’s hand was on his
shoulder, shaking him vigor-
ously. “Do you hear me?
You’ll have the whole ward
awake.”
“Take it away,” Mick im-
plored without lowering his
voice. “Take the thing away!”
Sharon knew when she was
beaten. She picked Ambrose
up, shut him in her office and
returned to her troublesome
patient.
“Now you stop this nonsense
and listen to me, Mick Regan,”
she commanded. “The cat has
gone. And I don't want to hear
one more word about Death
Cats. He was in here because
he follows me everywhere, not
because he’s interested in you.”
She pulled Mick’s pyjama
jacket down, scrubbed his arm
more vigorously than she had
ever scrubbed a locker in her
training-days, and rammed the
needle into him with a force
that would have put her well
up in the lists of javelin-
throwers.
“Now shut-up and go to
sleep.”
When she made her rounds
again at midnight Mick was
still awake, but instead of com-
plaining when she bent over
him he simply lay there, staring
up at the ceiling. Faintly
puzzled she felt his pulse. It
was a little faster than normal,
a little weaker and slightly
irregular. Deciding that there
was really nothing to worry

Australians have a reputation abroad for
coining of the apt expression. The character we
have come to present to the world is made up not
only of what we do, but what we say, and how
we say it.
But it came in picturesque reminder to me
recently that we are not alone in the art of idiom.
My good friend Mr. Gail Spain was across here
from the U.S.A., and he frequently used a
home-spun expression that stayed in my mind.
Anything that was right and good and free from
blemish was “No. 1 Clear” with him.
In origin the term goes back to the logging
industry in which Gail Spain began his business
career. “No. 1 Clear” is the call at the mill when
the saw takes the first long cut on a log and it
shows up in straight grain, free from knots
and blemishes.
Personally, I like it; the sound of it, the sense
of it. It is a phrase that is applicable to men as
well as to materials; to the individual and
collective quality of a nation, no less than to the
texture of a piece of timber.
And relating it, ourselves, to the task that is
before us in Australia, I think it has a particular
strength and meaning.
For, you see, this country with all its revealed
and hidden wealth, was here through the centuries
for any people to have entered upon and enjoyed.
By one of those accidents of history it just happened
that, under Providence, the inestimable good
fortune was to be ours.
But let us not confuse possession with proof
of the right to possess. Let us not, for example, rest
in the belief that any leisurely pacing of the rate
of Australia’s progress will suffice for the swift and
crowding world of our time.
On what we do, on what we are—spiritually,
morally, mentally, actively—the future depends.
And the grade of our performance throughout will
have to be “Number One Clear.”
about, Sharon left him, bu
because she believed in doing
the correct thing she put hin
on a half-hourly pulse chart.
The 12.30-pulse was definitely
worse. Sharon went into action
then. She removed the dress
ing and checked her patient’
wound. It was a normal, cleai
wound with no sign of bleed
ing. Sharon was a nurse who
took a pride in her profession
She had always disliked ole
Mick, but now he was no
longer Mick, the odd-job man
he was her patient, and no
patient of hers was going to
slip back if she could do any
thing to prevent it. After
making all the routine check
without finding anything un
usual she hurried back to her
office, her mind made up.
Well aware that staff doctors
dislike being called out in
the middle of the night for
trivial things she rang Doctor
Basil, the duty-doctor, anc
reported Mick’s condition.
“That damned old humbug!”
he growled. Still only half-
awake he questioned her
sleepily. Had she checked this?
Had she dene that?
Yes, she had done all those
things.
“I don't think there’s any-
thing to worry about, Sister,”
he said. “No need for me to
come up. Just keep him on
the half-hourly pulse and call
me again if you’re not satisfied.
And don't take too much
notice of his complaints. You
know old Mick; he’s never
happy unless he’s grousing.”
Determined to make her
point, Sharon said, “He’s not
grousing, doctor. That’s one
of the things I’m worried
about.”
But Doctor Basil had already
hung up.
At three o’clock Sharon
called him again. “I think
you’d better come straight up,
doctor,” she said. “Yes, it’s
old Mick again and I don’t
like his condition at all.”
Ten minutes later Doctor
Basil arrived, still convinced
that he was being dragged out
unnecessarily. He had assisted
at the operation and it had
been a simple, straightforward
appendectomy with no com-
plications. The patient's heart
and lungs were sound and by
all the rules he should have
made a speedy recovery.
But Mick didn’t recover.
With doctor and nurse doing
everything in their power to
save him, he died before dawn.
Poor Sharon got no sleep
that day. A post-mortem had
failed to reveal the cause o
Mick’s death, and the Medica
Superintendent was on th
warpath, determined to han
the blame on someone. Afte
listening to Doctor Basil’
report he called Sharon in anc
fired question after question a
her. Her answers, like he
professional conduct during th
previous night, were faultless
She had done everything she
should have done and she hac
done nothing that called fo
censure. Only one question
able point emerged from he
evidence. Doctor Basil Hac
not come up to the ward when
she first called him at 12.30.
“We'll go into that matte
later, Doctor,” the Medica
Superintendent said ominously
“At the moment I can’t see tha
your presence would have made
any difference, but that’s be
side the point.” He fidgeted
irritably with some papers on
his desk and turned back to
Sharon. “Have you anything
to add, Sister? Anything you
have forgotten to mention?
Anything that might throw
some light on this case?”
“There is one thing, doctor
...” Sharon hesitated, feeling
a little foolish. It seemec
absurd and out of place to
bring Ambrose into this. “We
have a cat in the ward, a black
cat.” Slowly at first, and then
gaining confidence as she began
to see the logic of it, she told
the whole story.
The Medical Superintendent
got up, thrust his hands into
his pockets and paced up and
down the room.
“Unbelievable!” he mut-
tered. “Unbelievable. But of
course it’s true. I performed
the operation myself and I
know there's no other possible
explanation. With a superstiti-
ous old fool like Mick it was
not only possible, it was in-
evitable. We’ll enter the cause
of death as shock. Not post-
operative shock, mark you;
there was nothing wrong with
that operation. Suicide would
be closer to the mark, but we
can’t put that in the records.”
He ceased pacing and glared
at Doctor Basil. “Well, we
can't bring old Mick back to
life, but by heck we can make
sure this doesn’t happen again.
You will make sure, doctor.
I'll hold you personally respon-
sible. I don’t know whether
there is a gun in the hospital
and what’s more I don’t care.
I don’t care what weapon you
use, but I want immediate
results. You can report the
death of that cat as due to gun-
shot wounds or stabbed to
death with a scalpel so long
as you report if to me before
lunch.”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
That Clock-tower
All the king’s horses and all
the king’s men would have their
work cut out to answer the
perennial call, lately strident
again, for the restoration of
Sydney’s G.P.O. clock-tower.
First, it would be difficult to
find many of the numerous,
consecutively numbered stones
intact —they have been stored
higgledy-piggledy in Maroubra
Telephone Exchange backyard
for years. Second, it would
probably be even more difficult
to find tradesmen capable of
replacing lost or shattered
“And a copy of How to Double Your Income!”
pieces and of putting the whole
together again. Stonemasonry in
Sydney is virtually extinct as a
trade, and stonemasons (in the
true sense of the term) as hard
to muster as authentic wheel-
wrights. Even to the layman’s
eye, the clock-tower obviously
was a hand-made or -fabricated
job in toto; in fact, most of the
beautifully carven and symbolic
stones (many seriously dam-
aged) represent stone-cutting of
an order that was becoming
rare as long as two generations
ago.
Also, another detail ap-
parently ignored or forgotten
by the clamorers is that the
original (Martin Place) wing of
the G.P.O. was, and probably
would still be, regarded as un-
safe under the tower's great
weight without considerable
and costly but - otherwise un-
necessary buttressing of much
of the old building itself. —
Postscript (N.S.W.).
Decentralisation Move
Goulburn (N.S.W.) City
Council has decided to appoint
a Sydney firm of management-
consultants to carry-out a
survey of the industrial poten-
tial of Goulburn, with a. view
to attracting new industries to
the city.
The plan was originated in
the city's Chamber pf Com-
merce.
When the consultants have
finished the survey (c os t,
£1700), council is to consider
whether to employ them on the
actual job of trying to talk in-
dustrialists into setting-up in
Goulburn, or whether it should
hand over the results, as it is
entitled to do, to the Division
of Industrial Development.
(This division comes under the
Pre m i e r’s Department, but
little is heard of its activities.)
When urging appointment of
the consultants a Goulburn
alderman said that “America
didn’t live on the seaboard as
Australia does,” and one of
the consultants, told council
that he thought Sydney “would
strangle itself” if more and
more industries were set-up
thereabouts.
Ever since I can remember,
The Bulletin has been urging
decentralisation, but the plea
has always fallen on deaf ears.
State Governments have only
paid lip-service to the ideal.
This move by Goulburn,
whatever council's later
decision, is a positive step in the
right direction. And it is one
that other cities and towns in
othei States as well as N.S.W.
should seriously consider
making.— Keima (N.S.W.).
Cast or Wrought?
After reading the review of
E. Graeme Robertson's Vic-
torian Heritage: Ornamental
Cast-Iron in Architecture (B
25/5/’6O) one has to agree that
it must be an interesting and
well-produced book; but to
call ornamental cast-iron “art”
is surely going too far.
Anything made of cast-iron
has a cold, lifeless appearance
and no individuality. Inherent
in the manufacture of designs
in cast-iron is a repetition of
their basic themes. Owing to
difficulties in the casting pro-
cess and brittleness, cast-iron
cannot be made in such
delicate and exquisite designs
as wrought-iron work. It is
manufactured, but does an
artist manufacture a picture or
a poet verse?
The vogue of ornamental
cast-iron in early Australia can
be attributed mainly to its
cheapness and to a lack of
aesthetic values in those times.
Ornamental wrought - iron
work has charm and life which
the craftsman has built into it
with his own hands; designs
such as flowers and leaf motifs
just cannot be produced as
delicately and naturally in cast-
iron. The old craftsmen in
wrought-iron were artists in-
deed. Unfortunately the r e are
very few specimens of their art
in our Australian cities.
Anyone who has been to
Europe must have been im-
pressed by the beautiful
wrought-iron work to be seen
in many towns and cities, some
of it hundreds of years old.
You can see if in and around
‘churches and cathedrals, as
entrance-gates to many estates,
as fountains in town-squares
and as signs of inns and hostel-
ries. The latter alone would
make an interesting study for
research.
As for our present-day so-
called ornamental wrought-iron
work, thousands of samples can
be seen in contemporary homes
serving as fly-doors and front
fences. Their design and execu-
tion is horrible in most cases—
except, perhaps, where the
design is based on geometrical
lines, incorporating diamonds
and squares. Everything is
geared to mass - production,
using templates and electric- or
oxy-welding. This type of
welding should have no place
in artistic ornamental work.
But here again, cost is probably
the deciding factor.
Comparing cast-iron work
with present-day wrought-iron,
it seems we have made no pro-
gress in artistic design or work-
manship from the early days. —

Hamilton Hume
Stuart Hume proves
Hamilton Hume's education
to his own satisfaction by
quoting letters written over
the explorer’s signature (B.
3/4/’6O). But letters aren't
good enough when composed
in the era of the professional
scribe.
D. C. Tilghman (B. 11/5/ ’6O)
approaches the subject from
another angle—from John
Dight’s approval of his daugh-
ter's marriage to the explorer.
“A lady of gentle birth,”
Tilghman says, “one can
hardly imagine her family
approving the match if Hume
had been illiterate or uncouth.”
I agree that neither of these
adjectives is applicable to
Hume. But, with all his close
research and meticulous typing
of records, one important item

has escaped Tilghman’s atten-
tion. After a visit to Hume’s
home at Appin on June 14,
1833, Mrs. Felton Mathews
recorded in her journal:
He [Hume] can also bear a part
on many other topics with more ease
than might be expected from the
very limited means of education
which he could have enjoyed. His
wife and her sister... .both speci-
mens of uneducated Australian
ladies.
In Hume’s obituary notice
published in the “Yass
Courier” of 22 /4/ ’73 reference
is made to Hume’s scholastic
attainments: “What education
he did get he received from
his mother ; and scanty though
it was he yet turned it to
good account.”
When writing No Boundary
Fence I purposely avoided
covering a bitter quarrel which
brought only discredit to two
men who, in their younger
days, did immeasurable ser-
vice to Australia. It was my
desire to portray a national
hero by depicting the strength
and greatness of his youth and
avoiding the weaknesses of his
declining years. The undigni-
fied wrangling of Hume and
Hovell when their achieve-
ments were already history
could well be forgotten. But
both Tilghman and Miss
Nicholson (B. 18/5/’6O) have
twisted my arm, and some of
the squabble must be
resurrected. x
Tilghman claims that
Hume’s “Brief Statement of
Fact” was written “when the
author was 58 and in full
possession of all his faculties.”
In December, 1853, 12 months
or more before Hume wrote
his “Statement” Hovell was
on his way to. Geelong to be
feted for his part in the over-
land journey. He consulted a
Mr. Watson, a connection of
Hume’s, as to the advantage
of taking Hume with him:
That gentleman objected to my
doing so [Hovell wrote] on the
ground that Mr. Hume’s habits
had of late become such as neither
to do him credit as an explorer
nor me credit as his companion.
Joyce Nicholson relies on
the “feel of authenticity” of
Hume’s “Statement of Fact.”
She accepts this in preference
to Hovell’s journal, from
which she finds human material
missing. Referring to Dr.
Lang’s claim that both he and
Hovell mistook Port Phillip
for Westernport, Hume wrote
in his “Statement” emphati-
cally, “I did not.” Yet, on
January 25, 1825, he wrote to
Governor Brisbane:
I have the honor to acquaint
your Excellency that last evening
I arrived safe home in company
with Mr. Hovell... .The last stream
we crossed before we arrived at
Westernport is in latitude 37deg.
22min., long. 146 deg. 25min.
On April 20 of the follow-
ing year Hume wrote to the
Secretary of State seeking a
land-grant. He referred to his
discovery of a “good and
extensive tract of land
adjoining Westernport.”
The “Australian” and the
“Gazette” of 10/2/’25 con-
tain accounts of the expedi-
tion, statements attributed to
the explorers and accounts of
the country in the vicinity of
Westernport. Hume made no
statement of correction for the
simple reason that he was in
complete agreement with his
colleague on the matter. He
didn’t find out that Port
Phillip Was the true terminus
of the journey until Hovell
returned from an expedition
sent by Darling to occupy
Westernport in 1826.
When Hume wrote, “I did
not” one is constrained to take
the charitable view that his
memory was at fault. But the
whole of the “Brief Statement
of Fact” becomes suspect,
Joyce Nicholson is bn danger-
ous ground in seeking to estab-
lish historical facts with only
her “feel of authenticity.” She
could find herself right up in
the top of a stringybark.
Hume’s “Statement” and the
supplements to it were written
after certain public compli-
ments were paid to Hovell in
Geelong at a dinner in Decern-
ber, 1853. These statements
are not history, no matter how
authentic one may “feel” them
to be. They should be
expunged from textbooks and
records. For human material
in Hovell’s journal Prefer Miss
Nicholson to the entries for
November 15 and 29, Decern-
ber 7,9, 16 and 17.
Miss Nicholson finds the
convict’s statements in Hume’s
record “so different in expres-
sion yet so much in agreement
that they must be accepted as
accurate.” Is this the “feel of
authenticity” again? My own
reaction was that Hume’s
scribe had concocted each of
them.
Tilghman assures us that
“Black Harry” O’Brien was a
gentleman and wouldn’t resort
to the knife. But Black Harry
came to Australia to escape
the consequences of a duel in
India ; and his brother, Cor-
nelius, who built Cooma
Cottage and sold it to Hamil-
ton Hume, was a ’9B rebel
under life - sentence. Has
Tilghman ever heard of Sars-
field, the Irish originator of
modern guerrilla warfare, ot-
of De Valera and his flying-
squads of 1916? “Dev”
wouldn’t like to be called an
“Irish kern.”

Fish
Average consumption of fish
per head of population in
Australia is 91b. a year. This
figure is arrived at by adding
imports and domestic produc-
tion and deducting exports.
According to the latest figures
for 1958-59, supplied by the
Commonwealth Director of
Fisheries, total imports of fish
—frozen canned, smoked or
dried were 50.5 - million lb.
Australian production was
estimated at 48 - million lb.
edible weight.
Total exports for the year
were 9-million lb., valued at
£3,665,242, of which crayfish-
tails accounted for over 7-mil-
lion lb., valued at £3,192,104.
Imports included frozen fish,
chiefly from South Africa,
United Kingdom, Denmark and
New Zealand ; canned herrings
mainly from United Kingdom ;
salmon from Japan ; sardines
from Norway, U.K., West
Germany, Portugal and
Canada; and South Africa is
the chief supplier of smoked
and dried fish.
The marketing position with
scale-fish throughout Austra-
lia is undoubtedly difficult
owing to this flood of cheap
imported fish. The main
varieties of fish exported from
the U.K. are bought in gutted
form at below 6d. a pound. By
buying in this form a fillet-
recovery of over 50 per cent,
is obtained, giving a cost of
below Is. a pound for fillets. No
labor-costs are added to this —.
proceeds from by-products pay
all wages. Thus U.K. fillets,
can be landed in Australia at
between Is. Bd. and 2s. a pound.
Concerning the price of 6d.
a pound paid to the U.K. fisher-
man, it must be noted that his
vessel is subsidised up to 25
per cent.; he is given a further
subsidy for every 141 b. of fish
landed, or, in some cases, a sub-
sidy based on the number of
days spent at sea.
In Australia, prices paid to the
fisherman are for ungutted fish.
On a fish for which he is paid,
say, Bd. a pound, filleting re-
covery is approximately 40 per
cent., which means that fillets
cost Is. Bd. a pound at point of
production. There is little out-
let in Australia for fish by-
products, so to the cost of
Is. Bd. must be added wages,
packaging, freezing, etc. On
these figures, and under present
conditions, it is obviously im-
possible for Australia to com-
pete against subsidised fish
from the U.K.
Because of this situation
filleting of our cheaper varieties
of fish has practically stopped
and they are being sold un-
gutted in the markets. Without
this outlet there would be prac-
tically no sale for them.
Unless some drastic changes
are made in the methods of
buying, processing and market-
ing of fish in Australia it seems
inevitable that we must con-
tinue to import over 50 per
cent, of our needs. Imported
frozen, canned and smoked
fish cannot compare in quality
and nutritive value with fresh
fish from our own coastal
waters, the supply of which
remains comparatively un-
tapped.
The bright spot in the local
fishing industry is the continu-
ing increase of the crayfish-
export trade. During 1958-59
craytail exports (7,092,2171 b.)
were up 22 per cent, on the
1957-58 total. Almost all the
craytails were exported to U.S.
and other dollar-areas. Earn-
ings, estimated at $6.9 million,
compared with $5.9 million in
1957-58, were up 17 per cent.
Although prices fell slightly
during 1958-59, good prices
were received for most consign-
ments. The average price of
Bs. lb. f.o.b. at Australian
ports was down 3d. lb.
on the previous year. The
total dollar-earnings for the
year 1958 - 59 were around
£A2,858,000.
Total crayfish production—
whole crayfish as distinct from
tails —-for all States for 1958-59
was over 25-million lb. W.A.
produced the greatest propor-
tion (17-million lb.) followed,
by S.A. (4-million lb.) and Tas-
mania (3-million lb.).
All crayfishing areas saw an
increase in the number of men
and vessels engaged in the in-
dustry. With the consequent
keener competition for cray-
fish, fishermen have been
forced to fish over a larger
area. Many are now fishing
out to the 60-fathoms line, and
are working with a larger num-
ber of pots.
The export of craytails is a
luxury trade, but the demand
for the tails in the U.S. shows
every sign of increasing, and
the return to the fishermen for
live crayfish at receiving-depots
continues to be very satisfac-
tory. —T. A. Miles (N.S.W.).

PRESS ETHICS AND ETIQUETTE
By M. F. DIXON
An indication of just how
seriously country people
regard the conduct of
their local newspapers
and how jealous they are of
the “freedom of the press” was
given recently at Maitland
(N.S.W.) when the shareholders
of the “Maitland Mercury”
practically took the control of
editorial policy out of the
hands of the directors (who
had banned the use of the
names of local aldermen in re-
ports of council meetings) and
restored it to the editorial
staff. This action was the
climax to a dispute which is
believed to be without prece-
dent in Australia.
The trouble at the “Mer-
cury” arose a couple of months
earlier when the Maitland
City Council extended an invi-
tation to the editor to attend
the centenary dinner of the
local show association. The
dinner was a rather “toney”
affair, the guests including the
chairman of the Senate, Sir
Alister McMullin. The chair-
man of directors of the “Mer-
cury” (Mr. B. S. McDermott),
a Sydney solicitor, wrote to
the council saying it should
have invited him to the dinner
and not the editor, he
said, stood in the same rela-
tion to the paper as did, say,
the health-inspector to the
council.
The council refused to alter
its invitation-list; and Mr. Mc-
Dermott then directed the
“Mercury” editor to exclude
the names of the mayor, aider-
men and town clerk from re-
ports of council meetings and
to refer any newsworthy items
containing such names to him
in Sydney.
The council became aware of
this order immediately it was
put into effect, and the mayor,
Aid. Skilton (himself a local
solicitor), called a public meet-
ing to discuss the position.
More than 200 businessmen
and prominent citizens
attended, and, after rejecting a
motion that the “Mercury” be
boycotted, the meeting carried
a series of motions requesting
the board of directors to with-
draw its direction to the editor
within seven days, and asking
the Australian Journalists’
Association to convene a board
of reference on the ground
that journalists were being
asked to work in violation of
the code of ethics of the asso-
ciation.
The “Mercury” board
igqored the request for the
withdrawal of its direction to
the editor, and the council then
decided not to place any more
advertisements with the paper
nor to give it any more job-
printing orders.
The next step in the dispute
was a petition by “Mercury”
shareholders for an extra-
ordinary general meeting to
consider the position. This was
held in Sydney and was
attended by 19 shareholders,
who voted 14-5 in favor of a
motion calling on the board to
withdraw its direction to the
editor of the paper. The board
chairman (Mr. McDermott)
then called for the proxies, and
these showed a majority of
824 in favor of the motion, the
respective totals being 12,093
and 11,269.
Four days later an announce-
ment appeared in the “Mer-
cury” on behalf of the board,
saying that the resolution of
the shareholders’ meeting in
Sydney a few days earlier had
been given effect to; and that
at a meeting of the board of
reference convened by the
A.J.A. it had been agreed that
there should be no restriction
on the publication of local
news of general interest beyond
the requirements of the law
and responsible editorial judg-
ment.
The statement added that
Mr. McDermott had written
to the board Saying he was
unwilling to continue as chair-
man, but would remain as a
director for the tifne being and
would also stand for election
again at the annual meeting.
He later left the board.
The same night the mayor
announced at a meeting of the
Maitland City Council that the
dispute with the “Mercury”
had been settled and all bans
and restrictions had been with-
drawn. The paper also
announced at the same time
that Mr. R. H. Woodlands* a
director of the paper for 12
years and a former managing-
editor, had been elected as
chairman.
The “Mercury” is owned by
a company with a capital of
£30,000 in £1 shares, and is the
second-oldest living newspaper
in N.S.W., having been estab-
lished in January, 1843. It is
therefore now in its 118th year
of publication, only 12 years
behind the “Sydney Morning
Herald.” The “Mercury” be-
came a daily in 1893.
The “Mercury” went through
a difficult time during the early
years of the depression. Until
a few years ago it was pub-
lished on six days a week, with
three editions on week-days
and four on Saturdays. The
Saturday edition carried a
complete cover of local and
metropolitan sport, and in the
mid-30’s enjoyed a sale as far
north as Armidale on the Sun-
day morning. That was before
the metropolitan Sunday papers
began to push their editions
hundreds of miles into the
country. More recently pub-
lication was reduced to five
days a week and the word
“Daily” was deleted from the
title.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
LAND HEALTH
By LADY EYE BALFOUR
A scientist with a European
reputation once said to me:
“When theory does not fit with
practice, it is always the theory
which must be wrong.”
There are Uvo current
theories concerning the causa-
tion and control of pests and
disease [in agriculture]. They
differ widely. It would there-
fore seem worth while to
examine them in the light of"
what actually occurs in prac-
tice, and, in so far as this bears
out any part of either, consider
whether the time has noj; come
to modify both and so evolve
a new theory more consistent
with the facts. It is this re-
valuation that I propose to
attempt.
Let us first state the theories
in juxtaposition and see where
we get.
Orthodox Theory.
(a) Diseases and pests have
always existed from prehistoric
times, and since the earliest recorded
times heavy losses from these causes
have been suffered by the culti-
vator.
The wool exported
from Peru during 1958
was 4.3 million lb., _
which is a loss of some
35 -per cent, on the
1957 total of 6.7
million lb.
It is indeed fortunate
for Australian graziers
that our wool exports
are maintaining their
high level, and the
constant quality of our
wool could be allied
to the use of Elastra-
tor for Castrating and
Tailing, because lambs
that have been cas-
trated and tailed by
Elastrator suffer little
or no setback, and
wool growth is not
impaired.
Use Elastrator Green
Rubber Rings next
time you castrate and
tail your lambs.
(, b ) In view of (a) modern agri-
cultural techniques cannot be held
responsible.
(c) Modern spray policy has
prevented, for the first time, heavy
losses from these causes and has
saved many a crop that would
otherwise have been lost. Thus
its advantages greatly outweigh its
disadvantages.
Organic Theory.
(a) Pests and diseases are
symptoms of biological unbalance.
“Climb to the top and see what you can see.”
C b ) Modern agricultural prac-
tices are largely responsible for
this unbalance.
(c) Spray policy, besides being
a potential hazard to health, still
further increases this unbalance.
Balance can be restored by organic
farming and gardening methods,
and this is, therefore, the only
sound long-term answer to the
problem.
We will now consider these
points in order.
(a) Unquestionably there is
evidence that so-called pests
and disease have always
existed. Since the biotic pyra-
mid consists of layers of
different forms of life, each
layer feeding the one above it
and dependent on the ones
below, it cannot indeed be
otherwise. The difference be-
tween a natural wilderness
community of food-chains and
a modern agricultural one is
that i» the former the “fauna
and flora, by this very process
of perpetual battle within and
among the species, achieve col-
lective immortality ... Paleon-
tology offers abundant evidence
that wilderness maintained it-
self for immensely long periods;
that its component species were
rarely lost, neither did they get
out of hand.” (Aldo Leopold).
This suggests that when a
species is threatened with realiy
destructive damage, interdepen-
dence has become imbalance.
If so, we can concede the first
clause of both theories, but
perhaps restate them thus:
Severe damage by pests and
disease is a symptom of bio-
logical imbalance. Such im-
balance occurs from time to
time under both primitive and
modern conditions, but much
less so where an environment
has not been subjected to the
very rapid changes which
modern man alone is capable
of bringing about.
(b) In view of this re-state-
ment of (a), which fits the
facts, can modern agricultural
practices be exonerated from
all guilt? I think not. Remem-
ber our yardstick is practice,
and what is in fact happening
in practice is an ever-increasing
incidence of serious pest and
disease infestation. As many
as 40 sprayings a year are now
common in orchards and are
apparently necessary to control
pests where one or two sufficed
a few years ago. In what way
modern techniques may be at
fault we will examine presently.
(c) Once serious imbalance
has occurred and is allowed to
continue, drastic remedies be-
come necessary. It is un-
questionably true that under
such conditions spraying has
resulted in the saving of a crop
which would otherwise have
been lost (whether such a crop
is always worth saving is a
point we will consider later).
That sprays also increase im-
balance is also incontrovertible.
The evidence is now so conclu-
sive that Dr. Pickett of the
Kentville Research Station in
Nova Scotia, has actually stated
that “the use of preparations
like D.D.T. in orchards, for
instance, by creating resistance
to D.D.T. and by destroying
natural predators of the noxi-
ous insects, actually perpetuates
the emergency for which these
compounds were used in the
first place.”

Macarthur
Sheep Show
The 1960 Sydney Sheep
Show, undoubtedly one of the
best ever, has reflected great
credit v on G. B. S. Falkiner,
president of the N.S.W. Sheep-
breeders’ Association, and his
committee. The enthusiasm
they were able to raise among
the general public and the high
standard of entries attracted to
the Show have indicated that a
new outlook could be on the
way for wool—still Australia’s
mosj. valuable product.
No supreme grand-cham-
pionship was awarded this
year; instead there were separ-
ate fine-, medium- and strong-
wool grand - championships
(fine-wool also including super-
fine, and strong-wool including
extra-strong).
The grand - championship
awards were :
Grand-champion fine-wool Merino
ram, A. Day and Son, Echo;
reserve, Merryville Pty., Ltd.
' Grand-champion fine-wool Merino
ewe, Llandillo Pastoral Co.;
reserve, A. Day and Son.
Grand-champion medium-wool

Grand-champion medium-wool

Dairy Products
[From “Agricola”]
Before War II Australia’s
dairy-industry was set on
a foundation of butter. If
you spoke to an overseas
visitor it was almost certain
he’d say: “Everyone knows
your butter at home. We
always eat it.”
During the war an influx of
milk-drinking American troops
brought increased demand for
milk. 'Pasteurising plants were
established in all capital cities
and in nearby industrial towns,
as well as in some centres near
military camps.
More and more people
began to drink milk. Dairy-
men who had met the demand
in the past found they could
not fill the expanding orders.
The milk-supplying districts
had to be enlarged. Milk-
routes were extended. Cheese-
factories diverted milk* from
their vats to insulated tankers,
which conveyed it to the pas-
teurising plants for treating
and bottling.
The changes did not pass
unchallenged. Many resented
the closure of cheese-factories.
Others lamented the fact that
butter-factories were losing
ground to those handling milk.
Then, for a time, the position
appeared to become stabilised.
The demand for milk seemed
to reach a level from which
it would take a lot of shifting.
In the meantime the annual
amount of cheese manufac-
tured in some States fell well
below past averages. Some
districts found they were
manufacturing barely enough
butter to meet local demands.
There was hardly a pound left
for export, despite the impact
that margarine had made on
the kitchen-table.
Some claimed that the
increase in demand for mar-
garine was caused by a short-
age of butter, due to the
increased demand for market-
milk. It’s not difficult to refute
this argument, but it shows
the way people were thinking.
The butter-industry is now
faced with another crisis. The
milk-industry is entering into
a fresh period of great expan-
sion. It started with the intro-
duction of free milk for
schools. More milk was
needed, so more farms began
to supply market-milk. Once
the children acquired a taste
for milk they wanted it
flavored, so flavored milk
began to appear in the shops.
In bottles, it retailed cheaper
than soft-drinks.
The demand for milk has
received fresh impetus with
the introduction of milk-
vending machines. Although
in their infancy, there’s little
doubt that these have a very
bright future. Many people
who drink a cup of tea from
a thermos-flask at lunch-time
will buy milk instead, if they
can get it fresh and without
fear of its being dispensed
in doubtful surroundings. The
vending-machine can give
them the product without any
of these worries.
Once the sale of milk to
the public becomes a simple
problem of “help yourself,”
the demand will increase
rapidly. Many of the different
varieties now available to the
American public will become
commonplace here. Fat-
reduced milk ; cultured milk
for those suffering from diges-
tive disorders ; antibiotic milk
for arthritic sufferers; fruit-
flavored milk for those who
prefer it so ; vitaminised milk
for those unable to eat cer-
tain foods —all will find a
ready markeh when they
appear. Vending - machines
which will make them avail-
able to all are already being
installed in the capital cities.
As well as these demands
for liquid milk there’s a grow-
ing market for fancy cheeses.
Continental cheeses to suit the
New Australian market will
mean more milk, and most of
it will have to come from
areas at present supplying
cream to butter-factories.
This paints a gloomy pic-
ture for butter-producers. But
need it be so? Certainly there
will be a drastic reduction in
the amount of butter exported ;
but this was always an unsure
market, heavily supported by
subsidy. If a ready home
market, at a reasonable price,
can be found for milk now
being made into butter and
sent overseas to face stiff
competition on the English
market, we will be much better
off in the long run.
The butter-industry will have
to undergo a greab deal of
reorganisation in its present
system and method of think-
ing. Small factories that are
just keeping afloat will prob-
ably close or be merged with
larger units. Capital will be
needed to install modern milk-
equipment. Factories that
haven’t the finance or the
number of suppliers to find
the extra money will go to
the wall. But in the long
run the individual supplier
will be better off —that’s the
most important thing.
The distribution of avail-
able butter will probably have
to be reorganised. At present
it’s looked on as almost a
crime to import butter from
another State, or even another
district. This line of reason-
ing is out-of-date. If one dis-
trict or State has trouble
meeting its liquid-milk needs
it would be foolish to restrict
the sale of milk just to supply
butter because it hadn’t been
brought into the place from
another district or State before.
It needs to be kept in mind,
when considering the fate of
the butter-industry, that no
one will be forced out of
dairying, and all will be better
off in the end. A solid home
market, backed by an assured
fair price, is better than
gambling on an unsteady over-
seas market which has to be
bolstered with a stiff dose of
subsidy. The increased prices
received for fancy cheese and
milk in its various forms will
mean more in the pockets of
the dairyfarmer, as well as
profits for the factory.
New markets will mean sol-
vent, well-equipped factories,
which are real assets. As most
of them are co-operative, this
means the farmer’s assets are
increasing as well as his profits.
Oats
“Pat O’Day”: As well as
leading to some wise plantings
of turnip-crops for sheep, the
drought on the South-west
Slopes of N.S.W. has driven
home the lesson that it’s better
to grow fodder than have to
buy ■ it at prevailing prices.
Some graziers are putting at
least a quarter of their land
under cultivation.
Elevation of the district
averages around 735 ft., and the
rainfall is about 25in. (though
drought brings it much lower).
The land is generally undulat-
ing, with soil varying from
river-flats to red and yellow
pod-soils, largely derived from
slate, with small outcrops of
granite.
Of the three types of oats
favored in the area, Algerian
and Belar are best, with Ideal
third. Success in growing oats
depends largely on using the
right seed.
Algerian is more widely
grown than the other two
varieties for green-feed, silage
and grain. Although it stools
profusely, spreading over the
ground for a considerable time
at planting, this variety has
fairly fine stems. It needs to
be sown early to give best
results.
Belar, which comes under
the heading of early mid-season
varieties, is a selection from
Sunrise. It shows a purple
tint when ripe and is a good
general-purpose crop, very pro-
ductive for hay.
Ideal, of recent introduction,
is very suitable for grazing.
White Tartarian is also worth
mentioning. It's a late-matur-
ing type. On the tableland
country it should be sown at
from 1-f to 2 bushels to the

acre, with a lower rate in dry
districts.
In Victoria the main varieties
are Algerian and its improved
selection Algeribee, late-matur-
ing types which produce a
grain suitable for the oat-mill-
ing trade. They stool -Jbetter
than the early types, and have
proved adaptable over many
years. In southern Victoria they
recover well after grazing, and
therefore are»favored by dairy-
farmers, who sow Algerian in
early autumn, graze it until
spring, and then mow it for
hay or grain after normal
spring-rains. In northern part
of the State—particularly in the
Mallee —spring-rains often fail,
and earlier maturing varieties
like Mulga or Dawn are best.
These early types also produce
more winter-feed than Algeri-
bee or Algerian, particularly if
sown thickly.
The choice of variety
depends largely on the purpose
for which the crop is grown.
Varieties recommended for
various parts of Victoria are:
Wimmera and northern dis-
tricts: Algeribee or Algerian
for grain and general purposes;
Dawn, Fulghum, Guyra, Belar
and Mulga for early feed or
early hay.
Mallee district: Dawn, Ful-
ghum. Belar and Mulga for
general purposes and early
feed; Algeribee or Algerian for
hay and grain, or grain for
sale.
Southern districts: Algeribee
or Algerian for general pu:-
poses, with Tartarian (white
or black) for spring - sowing
where the season is late.
Tetanus
“Deter”: After many years
of research tetanus remains a
100 - per - cent, killer among
sheep. How many sheep die
from it cannot be accurately
estimated. Most sheep found
dead after shearing, crutching,
mulesing or lamb-marking are
destroyed without the cause of
death being known, but these
operations set -up favorable
conditions for the germ ;o
operate, so it’s certain that
many deaths are due to tetanus.
Infection takes place through
wounds, and soon the germ
generates a poison which
affects the nervous system.
Symptoms are a stiff gait with'
hind-legs spread, head down
and tail elevated. The animal
soon falls, with its head arched
backwards and jaws frequently
locked.
Valuable animals l suffering
from tetanus are sometimes
treated with anti-serum and
antibiotic injections, but good
results are few.
Intense hygiene before
shearing, crutching, etc., helps
to combat tetanus. _ Shearing-
and crutching-boards should be
scrubbed with disinfectant and
the surroundings sprayed.
Water to reduce dust is also
necessary. Injection of tetanus
anti-serum gives immediate
immunity for about 14 days.
Tetanus-toxoid injected separ-
ately at the same time, with
another injection 12 months
later, will give lifetime protec-
tion.
Footrot in Cattle
“Mulga”: Wet conditions
often set-off serious outbreaks
of fo o trot in cattle-herds.
Yards and laneways of sharp,
rough metal cause bruising and
abrasions, and often aggravate
the disease. Concrete yards
and paths help to reduce the
infection-rate.
An acute, inflammatory re-
action occurs most commonly
between the claws, and may
scon spread, whereupon pastern
and fetlock become swollen.
Early treatment, however,
can lead to rapid recovery, and
will lessen the probability of
the infection extending to the
adjacent joints and tendons
(should this occur, chronic
lameness may result).
Sulphonamides or penicillin
give excellent results when used
early at the correct dose-rate.
Run affected cattle in a pad-
dock close to the yards, so that
they d@ not have to walk long
distances.
In a chronic case the hoof
may need paring to allow the
site of the infection to drain,
and footbaths twice daily with
a 5 per cent, copper-sulphate
solution are recommended.
~ r ,
Owners of large herds m
which trouble is experienced
every year should consider
yearly vaccination against the
condition. The treatment is
not costly, and will increase the
resistance of the herd to infec-
tion.
If further details are needed,
consult the local Agricultural
Department veterinary officer
or stock-inspector.
Fox-baits
“Ranger”: It’s no good
always using the same type of
fox-bait and putting it down in
the same locations every time.
Foxes, even when starving, are
far too cunning to take risks
with such obvious lures. You’ve
got to keep changing baits all
the time.
Tender bits of meat are the
commonest baits used, so a
change to fowl or fish could
give good results. Occasionally
eggs planted under a light
covering of earth or grass also
prove successful. Baits that
are not easy to like one
wrapped in a piece of sheep-
skin and pushed down a rabbit-
burrow, help to stimulate a
fox’s natural hunting instinct
and are usually taken.
When flesh, fish or fowl is
used for bait, it should be
frozen hard before the poison
is inserted, and should be put
out while still frozen. Thaw-
ing helps to take away the
human taint and make the bait
more acceptable.
Always let neighbors know
the position of baits, so that
valuable dogs can be protected.
If you go out shooting foxes
at night £he target is easy to
identify—a fox’s eyes have a
red gleam; those of a sheep
show green.
REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(2/ 6/’60)
Queensland is likely to have only light rains during
July, although part of the Darling Downs can expect better
falls. However, there should be reasonably good rains in the
coastal districts and on the central highlands, Darling
Downs, Maranoa and Warrego during August.
N.S.W. should have light to moderate patchy rains
during July, with better falls in the coastal districts, and on
the tablelands and part of the western division during
August. Light to moderate rains, generally below normal,
can then be expected until November.
Good rains are likely in Victoria during July, with the
best falls in the eastern, central and north-eastern districts,
in East Gippsland and along the west coast. There should be
moderate patchy rains in August, with general rains in
September.
Good rains are likely in the agricultural areas and along
the west coast of South Australia during July, with moderate
falls extending into the north interior. Good rains should
continue in the agricultural areas during August and Sep-
tember.
The agricultural areas of Western Australia should
have good rains—though below normal—in July. Best falls
are likely on the s.-w. central coast, with light to moderate
rain about the Gascoyne.

Is Malua an aboriginal name ?
Details of the career of the race-
horse of that name ?
Malua is not listed in the
reference-books of aboriginal names.
The closest are Malu, kangaroo;
Malura, cormorant; and Maluta,
species of possum.
Malua was a notable Australian
racehorse. • In 1884 he ‘ won the
V.R.C. Newmarket Handicap,
6fur., and the Oakleigh Plate,
sifur., the Adelaide Cup, 13fur.,
and the Melbourne Cup, 2 miles.
In 1886 he won the Australian
Cup, 2j miles, then his first and
only jumping-race, the Grand
National Hurdle, 3 miles. He was
the first Tasmanian-bred horse to
win the Melbourne Cup, in which
he carried 9st. 91b. and was ridden
by Alick Robertson. He was
owned by J. O. Inglis and trained
by Ike Foulsham. Malua sired
another Melbourne Cup winner,
Malvolio (1891).

What is the burning-rate of a
blasting-fuse ?
From the N.S.W. Department of
Mines:
Government specifications demand
burning-time limits of safety-fuse
at between 80-100 seconds per yd.
The normal aim of manufacturers
is to achieve a burning-rate of
90sec. per yd., or 2ft. a minute.
Safety-fuse is manufactured with
the most rigorous attention to
uniformity, and many miles are
burnt annually at the factories
during testing. The so-called
“running-fuse” has never been
discovered. Safety-fuse is yellow
for maximum visibility, and con-
sists of a train of powder covered
by several layers of yarn and water-
proofing compound. The Mines
Department requires the minimum
length of fuse used to be 6ft.

What are bouts-rhymes, and
can you give an example ?
Addison described them as
“lists of words that rhyme to one
another, drawn-up by another hand
and given to a poet, who has to
make a poem to the rhymes in
the same order that they were
placed on the list.” The more odd
and perplexing the rhymes are,
“What the blazes are you DOING up there, Mr.
Hornblower —I can see fish through my porthole !”
the more ingenuity is required to
give a semblance of commonsense
to the finished thing. As an
instance, the rhymes breeze, elephant,
squeeze, pant, scant, please, hope,
pope were submitted, and the
following stanza was the result:
Escaping from the Indian breeze,
The vast, sententious elephant
Through groves of sandal loves to
squeeze
And in their fragrant shades to pant;
Although the shelter there be scant,
The vivid odours soothe and please.
And while he yields to dreams of hope,
Adoring beasts surround' their pope.

What were the circumstances
governing the bombardment of the
Baltic port of Kronstadt by British
warships in 1919 or 1920 ? Was
the action taken in accordance
with a treaty, or was it in con-
nection with the Anglo-French-
Finnish intervention in Estonia in
the same period ?
In 1919, during the first attack
by the White Russian General
Yudenich against Leningrad, Kron-
stadt was bombarded from the air
by the White Army while an English
warship penetrated the harbor and
torpedoed a cruiser. The action
was in accordance with no treaty;
it was simply part of the general
effort by Britain to assist counter-
revolutionary forces to beat the
Bolsheviks.

Among the Keyboard Kings
Reputedly the most dis-
tinguished of living Russian
pianists, Svjatoslav Richter
adduces quite a heap of evi-
dence in support of the claim
in his reading of Mozart’s
Piano Concerto No. 20, K. 466,
from Deutsche Grammophon
(LPM 18595). Of the 30 works
he wrote for this form, the
D Minor is undoubtedly one
of the composer’s most
inspired, and the middle move-
ment is built on one of his
most famous melodies. Richter
captures the true Mozart
refinement and elegance and
gears to them a tone of cap-
tivating lucidity. On the
'reverse side he leaps 150 years
to make much of the incisive
wit inherent in Prokofieff’s
Concerto No. 5 and by his
dynamic playing to give more
than a hint of his versatility.
The collaborating orchestra
is the Warsaw National Phil-
harmonic, conducted by
Witold Rowicki.
To show, too, that he could
also deliver witty comments in
crotchets and quavers, Mozart
composed his “Little Gigue,
K 574,” and the - late Walter
Gieseking uses this gem as
a pipe-opener to his Gieseking
Souvenirs, a Columbia disk
(330CX 7515). There follow

Louis Graeler plays the
“Duke of Edinburgh,” a violin
made by Carlo Bergonzi in

That mid-winter paradox, the swim-
suit parade, is with us again, this time
at the Myer Emporium, which, fortun-
ately, is sufficiently heated so that
mannequins aren’t showing-off their
goose-pimples as well as the suits. These
special parades feature the Rose Marie
Reid collection, and the designer has
adopted a Grecian line with soft-jersey,
classically draped and moulded to the
figure. Theta is a sheath of
nylon-jersey briefly belted and drawn in
fluent surplice-lines over controlling
elasticised bengaline; Dorica, a classic
sheath with silk-soft draping which begins
at the bodice and lavishly wraps the
waist-line to a fluted cummerbund above
a slender column of lastex; Medea is of
draped and pleated Arnel in abbreviated
one- and two-piece versions of the
Grecian robe ; Mediterranean colors as
well as white were used to make these
graceful swimsuits, which emphasise the
soft look for the coming season.
Also shown was the Limited Editions
Collection, also by Rose Marie Reid.
This group is in the luxury-class and
features both the softened, feminine look
and one of stark simplicity. The fabrics
are new and exciting, the colors for the
most part subdued and muted —subtle
olive or fawn, black or white, delicately
light and clear prints on featherweight
Vyrene. Outstanding in this group was
a wrapped-waist slim swim-suit of black
mantilla-lace, made (for the sake of con-
vention) over toast-elasticised bengaline
and called La Ballade. Glitter and glamor
were seen in a rose-patterned over-print
on elasticised Shimeron which swept over
one shoulder. Chanson featured a one-
strap sheath of intricately-mitred tiny
nylon pleats. In many of them soft-
printed Vyrene is handled like pure silk
and brings high fashion to the new swim-
suits. Knowing the importance of both
lightweight fabrics and the low-back
suits, two new bras have been designed.
These are made of three materials fused
into perforated permanently-shaped
shells, each cupped with flexible profiles
to lift, mould and define separation.
This is the circolair bra. Then there is
the full-cup bra for the youthful but full-
busted figures as well as mature figures.
The lower half of the cup is reinforced
for support and it is flexible to mould
the curves, and an elastic bandeau
securely fitted underneath ensures com-
fort.
The cotton swimsuit takes on a new
look in a silhouette called Blouson
Shorts. The easy-bloused top is fitted to
a waistband which is inset above
narrowly-tapered shorts. Tambour is a
dark patchwork-pattern and adds a skirt
of unpressed pleats. An adaptation of
the circolair bra is used for this relaxed
line in both knits and cottons. Having
seen these attractive swimsuits, summer
can’t come soon enough!
Deanna, only daughter of Mrs. Con-
stance Day, of Toorak, was educated at
St. Catherine’s, and since leaving school
last year has been a mannequin in
fashion-shows and Has appeared in
several TV-shows and at the Little
Theatre, where she was the flighty Lucy
in Irene Mitchell’s production of “The
Happiest Millionaire.” Ski-ing and
swimming are her sports. On June 27
Deanna’s brother Neville will be given a
farewell-party by their mother at home
prior to his leaving for a three-months’
holiday abroad.
In 1931 a small group of American
women living in this city formed them-
selves into an auxiliary to work for the
Royal Children’s Hospital. Since then
almost every woman who has come from
the U.S. to live here, even if only for a
few years, has joined-up. As a result
of all this activity, the auxiliary has
raised over £52,000 since its inception.
To mark its 29th birthday the American
Women’s Auxiliary celebrated with a
luncheon at the home of American Con-
sul W. F. Ryan and Mrs. Ryan. Mrs.
Heathcote Wright, president of the
auxiliary, and Mrs. Ryan received more
than 80 guests. A congratulatory letter
from U.S. Vice-President Richard Nixon
was read, and a spoon for 20-years’
service was presented to Mrs. N. Gilbert;
for 10-years’ service Mrs. Deveraux Myt-
ton, Mrs. Peter Gibbes and Mrs. Ethel
Rogers also received spoons. Among
guests at the luncheon were Lady
Murdoch (president of the Royal Child-
ren’s Hospital), Mrs. A. J. Mclntosh
(president of the auxiliaries), Mrs. James
Clymer, Mrs. Gerald Bacon, Mrs. Claude
Deem, JVlrs. Mark Clements and Mrs.
Noel Gilmore. Mrs. W. McGann had
her mother, Mrs. Robert Volbracht, with
her at the luncheon. With her husband,
Mrs. Volbracht has made her home here
to be near her daughter. Another visitor
was Mrs. Hansen, who is visiting her
daughter, Mrs. Charles Bacon.

The description of an oasis as “a
fertile spot or tract in a sandy desert ;
any place of rest or pleasure in the midst
of toil,” was contained in the invitation
to the opening of the Oasis Figure Form,
a wonderfully-equipped building which
was opened by Federal Transport Minis-
ter Hubert Opperman. Modern and
luxurious, the Oasis has every facility a
woman could want to keep her fit and
healthy. There are Turkish-baths, squash-
courts, a hairdressing-salon, a comfort-
able rest-lounge in which TV is installed
and an oscillating-machine for removal
of surplus weight. Business-girls may
have a shower there and change into
party-frocks. Tom Trevaskis, who runs
his family’s frock-manufacturing business
in Flinders Lane, thought this one up.

Over 200 guests attended the dinner-
dance in the Bamboo Room at Chevron
given by the president, Mrs. John Carro-
dus, and members of the South Yarra
Auxiliary of the Y.W.C.A. Mrs. Carro-
dus topped her short, slim, black faille
skirt with a low-necked blouse of white
French-lace embroidered with rhine-
stones and drop-pearls. Auxiliary trea-
surer Mrs. Bob Gamble was with her
husband ; Mr. and Mrs. Clive Walters,
Mr. and Mrs. Ken Reynolds and Mr. and
Mrs. James Wallace were there. Also
saw the Lionel Newtons (she wearing a
short black square-necked faille frock
and a white mink-stole).


SYNEY
Such goings-on as there were in Sydney
during the week! .Nearly everyone at
all the parties had just “come-on” from
somewhere or was going-on to some-
where else. It wasn’t only that there
were such a number of things to attend
but that really it takes more than one
engagement these days to justify the
worries attached to transport and
parking.
☆
The presence of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra in town was the main cause of
all this transience, however. Those party-
goers who had come-on from the Stadium
concert looked as if they had come-on
from the South Pole. Even the orchestra
wore overcoats! Wise peope who attend
concerts at the Stadium provide them-
selves with rugs and cushions. South
Pole-sitting can be so arduous.
The sooner that Opera House gets
itself built the better for this city. When
one hears that the new County Council
building at the corner of Bathurst Street
is to cost £3 million, the price of the
Opera House seems quite moderate. This
week’s doings showed many music-lovers
more forcibly than ever that even the
Town Hall is unsuitable for such an
orchestra as the Boston Symhpony.
Those in the front rows were almost
blown away by the sheer volume of
sound.
☆ ☆ ☆
A brilliant effect was achieved at the
Harlequin Ball in aid of the Mater
Misericordias Hospital, held at the Troca-
dero during the week. The gay decor, in
which a circus motif predominated, was
aided by the freer arrangement of the
tables which quite escaped the usual
“boarding-school” formality and created
an atmosphere of space and graciousness.
Mrs. Tom Bateman, with Dr. Bateman,
received as guests-of-honor the Governor
and Lady Woodward (who had come on
from the first half of the Boston Sym-
phony Orchestra’s concert at the Stadium),
and were accompanied by their son
and daughter Edmund and Rosalind. The
judges of the most beautiful dress, not
black or white, were Mrs. Bruce Mc-
Farlan, Mrs. Stella Fraenkel and Mr.
George Molnar, their choice falling on
the Grecian-draped dress of silver lame
worn by Mrs. Bob Mclnerney.
Several honors fell on the party hos-
tessed by Mrs. C. P. Rudwick, as her
candle-lit arrangement of frosted-grapes
and gilded-leaves won her first-prize for
the best-decorated table, while three of
her guests —Mrs. Denis O’Neil, Mrs.
Frank Kenny (Bathurst) and Mrs. C.
Greiner (Killara) were among the
finalists for the most beautiful dress,
second place going to Mrs. Greiner for
her elegantly-draped sheath in silk-
jersey.

Debutantes dominated the Legacy Ball
at the Trocadero on Thursday night, 21
lovely young girls, all wards of Legacy,
making their bow to the Governor and
Lady Woodward. Their youthful escorts
were all in white-tie-and-tails, their
bouquets were slender sheaths of
“gladioli roses” (a happy change from
the tight little Victorian posy), and their
matron-of-honor, Mrs. Ivan Dougherty,
looked charming in a dress of orchid-
pink delustred satin with crystal em-
broidery. Mrs. F. B. McAlister trained
the debutantes for their presentation, as
she does every year. Host and hostess
to the 800 guests present were Legacy
president W. J. Colman and Mrs.
Colman..
A special mention should be made of
the particularly lovely cakes which decor-
ated each deb’s table, two of the most
striking having been made by Barbara
Mason, who was herself a deb at the
Legacy Ball a couple of years ago.
Though individual in design, the. cakes
she decorated for her friends Betty
Kernot and Marilyn Solomons each
represented a doll in a bouffant debutante
frock with fine tucking and embroidery
carefully carried-out in the icing-sugar.
Needless to say, each had to be photo-
graphed before it was cut for the party!
Here we present Miss Wendy Black-
lock as Sydney’s own original little
comedienne. Though she has had con-
siderable overseas experience, Wendy’s
sense and projection of humor typify the
Australian attitude and proceed from an
exuberance of spirit coupled with an
economy of words. At present to be
seen in the Phillip Street Theatre's pro-
duction of “Mistress Money,” she creates
a character of wide-eyed simplicity that
is extraordinarily comical. Her photo
is by John Hearder.
Nearly everybody at the preview-party
for the Theatre Design Exhibition in
David Jones’ Art Gallery seemed to be
“going-on” to hear the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, and fur coats (mostly of the
full-length ermine type) were the vogue.
Miss Margaret Gillespie, who organised
the exhibition in aid of the Opera House
Appeal, welcomed the guests, who
included Mr. Robin Bailey (who was
“going-on,” needless to say, to “My Fair
Lady” because he’s the star of it) and
Mrs. Bailey, Mr. and Mrs. Eric Langker,
Director of Education, H. D. Wyndham
and Mrs. Wyndham (going-on to “Mon
Oncle”), singers Kenneth Neate and
Heather Beatty, designer Desmonde
Downing (whose set for “The Piccadilly
Bushman” excited much admiration),
A.B.C. “set-men” (if that’s the right term),
Douglas Smith (remember his set for TV
“Hamlet”?), James Hall, Ronald Wol-
veridge and Michael Santry, many North
Shore Liners including Mr. and Mrs.
Neils Giddings, and three handsome ladies
on holidays from Melbourne, Miss Jean
Carter, Miss Elva Breen and Miss Trixie
Johnstone. _
The following afternoon the exhibition
was opened for the public by Lady
Lloyd Jones, and the Consul-General
for Denmark, Mr. Henning Hergal,
announced the winners. First prize went
to J. Blain (Brisbane) for “The Lark”
setting, second to Joan A. Swinbourne
for her setting for “Peter and the Wolf,”
and third prize to Algis Butavicius (Can-
berra) for his “Waiting for Godot” set.
The latter’s set for “The Voyage of
Magellan” was also highly commended,
as was “Street-car Called Desire” by John
E. Atkinson, and '“The Crucible” by A.
Arkinstall.

Cyril Ritchard arrived in town during
the week looking handsome and larger
than life as an actor-star should. He is
auditioning applicants for parts in the
play “The Honor of His Company,”
which opens in Melbourne shortly and
comes back here later (don’t ask why).
Mr. Ritchard says he doesn’t see much
change in Sydney since he was here last —
which was both pleasing and disappoint-
ing. It’s nice to know that the city doesn’t
change, no matter what, but somehow
we did hope that all the building and the
scaffoldings and the hammerings and the
demolishings would at least have pro-
duced something different, even if it’s
not better.

Table-setting displays are always
interesting, for, apart from the sheer joy
of beholding something beautiful, one
can usually get a few wrinkles for one's
own small efforts. The display organised
by the ladies’ committee of the
Australian-American Association in aid
of H.M.A.S. Watson Appeal at the
Mon ash Hut, Rose Bay, provided both
angles and included, for good measure,
an official opening by Mr. Dick Bentley,
radio and TV star, and a model of the
chapel of Watson’s Bay, which is the
object of the appeal.
The Golden Anniversary table set by
Mrs. John O'Brien was particularly beauti-
ful, with its white cloth shot with golden
thread and its black-and-gold cutlery.
Mrs. G. V. Patrick cut-out heart-shaped
place-mats of shiny red cardboard for her
lovely little St. Valentine’s Day setting
and attached smaller hearts to the ends of
the red ribbon bows which adorned the
rim of the table (this is an idea which
we might use for an engagement-party,
as we do not keep St. Valentine’s Day).


and the Balkans, and finally the defeat
of Germany in the West led eventually
to the Armistice of 1918.
Cyril Falls sums-up:—
Foch and Haig emerge as the
great captains of 1918: Foch, because
he held the Allies together, in every
sense, by his personality and mag-
nificent fund of will-power; Harg,
because of his refusal to admit de-
feat, his skill on the defensive and the
- way he accepted the main burden of
the effort for victory, knowing that
his armies would carry it and no one
• else could. Both were men of un-
conquerable souls. The third supreme
figure, Ludendorff, without their
virtues of character, is nevertheless
the most striking of the whole war in
one respect. He realised that this
was the first people’s war of the
industrial age and saw that the
interests of the scientist and the
workman and the soldier were all
one.
Falls describes the moral effects of
War lon Britain as “deeper... .than
in the peoples of her partners in vic-
tory” and explains the flood of anti-
militarist literature “for the greater
part fiction, which poured from the
presses, deriding leadership from top
to bottom, treating patriotism as a vice
when not as a fraud,” as unrepresenta-
tive but symptomatic of widespread
disillusion. “Yet,” he says, “when at
last the decision to stand up to Hitler
was taken it was discovered that Britain
was sound and France divided, scared
and spiritless.”
Of the Americans, he writes:—
The extreme view of the Ameri-
cans’ part in the war, that France
and Britain muddled it for eleven-
twelfths of the time and that the
United States put it right in the last .
twelfth, is moonshine. It would have
been impossible unless the men had
been demigods. The United States
high command had not, in fact, any
great influence on the conduct of
the war, apart from its representation
on the Supreme War Council.. ..
The contribution of the United States
Army was its first-class fighting
qualities, but it was only in the last
two months that it was engaged on a
considerable scale.
And in conclusion:—
The roots of the blame are too
tangled to follow. Eventually it can
all be traced to homo sapiens, so
named. Yet we cannot forget that
the victors had to a large extent a
free hand to make a new world. It
could never have come up to their
hopes. They might have made some-
thing better of it than they did.
Rollo Gillespie.
Penguins and Pelicans
James Dugan’s Man Explores the
Sea, one of the latest hatching of
Penguins and Pelicans, discusses just
about everything in the saltwater
except penguins and pelicans; and an
amazingly rich and rewarding book it
is, especially when you consider that
it is essentially a journalistic compila-
tion, not —though Dugan has sailed
with Cousteau —personal experience.
Once staff-correspondent for “Yank”
magazine, Dugan writes as if he had
been trained on one of those papers
where every sentence must consist of
no more than six short words typed
as a paragraph on a separate sheet of
copy-paper (so that the masses may
understand it, and so that the sub-
editors may the more readily cut its
bare bones down to still barer bones
if need be); and if ever the method
paid-off, it does here. Crisp, clean,
economical, with hardly an adjective
and never a qualifying clause, packed
with unadorned fact, the sentences fol-
low each other in vigorous, unending
progression, like an army marching, as
if Dugan were completely confident
that his stock of facts is both irresist-
ible and inexhaustible—and that indeed
is the case.
In spite of his ominous subtitle, “An
exciting history of underwater explora-
tion from the earliest times to Captain
Cousteau,” which arouses the fear that
he may be going to drag-up all sorts
of tentative and meaningless attempts
at underwater exploration away back
in history, irrelevant to what is essen-
tially a modern development, he does
not often go far into the past for his
material; and when he does it is sur-
prising how relevant it is. In 1505 the
Vikings of Gruneland used sealskin
submarines, each accommodating three
men who crept up on visiting ships and
bored holes in their bottoms (the raids
by Australian and British commandos
on Japanese shipping in Singapore
Harbor were hardly new in concep-
tion!). In the 17th century a Dutchman
named Cornelius van Drebbel built a
“submersible galley” for 12 rowers,
with a breathing-tube to the surface,
and gave joyrides in it 12ft. down in
the Thames. A Connecticut Yankee
named David Bushnell in 1776 built
a barrel-shaped “submarine” of wood
and iron, submerged by a screw on the
roof and propelled by another screw
behind, and with this curious craft
attempted to sink the British Navy in
New York Harbor ... in which he was,
with great peril to himself, unsuccess-
ful, so he turned to making contact-
mines.
But most of Dugan’s explorations are
no further away than the time when
Professor Leonard Hill’s goats (late
in the 19th century) chewed the electric
cord and blew themselves up in the
oxygen pressure-tank; or the pioneer
salvage of the wreck of the Royal
George at Spithead in 1839. when
Corporal Jones and Private John Gir-
van fought in the depths over a piece
of timber and Jones put a boot through
Girvan’s face-plate; or the seven-year-
long task which Captain Damant began
during World War I to salvage
£5,000.000-worth of gold-bars which
the White Star liner Laurentic was
carrying to Canada to pay for war-
materials when she was sunk by a
mine off Malin Head in Donegal.
And so to the treasures of the Egypt
and the Niagara; to rescues and escapes
from submarines in World War II; to
Edgerton building robot electronic-
flash cameras to send into the Deep
Scattering Layer; to Cousteau; to the
“Abyss”; and to spear-fishing. It is
fact piled on fact, all fascinating,
masterly in its grasp of the subject,
and saved from the slightest dryness
because of the author’s restrained
enthusiasm and because the sea, after
all. is wet.
It is a considerable plunge, or ascent,
from “Man Explores the Sea” to John
Wyndham’s novel The Midwich
Cuckoos; but that is the sort of thing
that happens in the Penguins, and, if
Dugan really shows how far a good
factual book can outrun the average
novel. “The Midwich Cuckoos” is
nevertheless a pretty good thing of its
THE SAILOR: MAY, 1960
The sailor settled the oar at his back,
Over the hills he took the track
And the blue sea dipped behind him.
Whenever he saw beneath his palm
The shimmering roofs of a country town
He rubbed his hands and hoisted his
oar —
But those who came to gape at the door
Cried out, “Well, look at the sailor!”
Over the crests of the Great Divide
Down the slopes on the other side
Across the plains out westward —
And still as he walked through one-horse
towns
Or droving-camps or miningrclaims
The folk came out to watch him pass
And chewing a stalk of summer grass
Said, “What do you know —a sailor!”
Way out west where the red sand spins
And the plains lie down under gibber-
stones
He followed the stock-routes inland.
The stockmen shouted, “Sailor, hey!”
But he came at last to the end of his way
For he heard a voice from a humpy
croak
“What’s that, mate, tied up on your
back?”
And, “Here I stay,” cried the sailor.
I’ve half a mind to hoist a gun
And follow the way that sailor’s gone . . .

kind: which is science-fiction. There is
a pleasant picture of English village life
in it; and, if one is not very keen on
flying-saucers landing on the village-
green and mysteriously making all the
women pregnant, it is quite haunting
and surprising when it turns-out that
all the golden-eyed children born from
this visitation share a sort of group-
mind, like the insects, so that when
one of them learns to walk or talk or
ride a bicycle all the rest can simul-
taneously do likewise. Moreover, they
can dominate ordinary people by a
kind of telepathy, so that when you
find it necessary to shoot them down
they can make you shoot yourself
instead ... a very interesting situa-
tion, which Wyndham handles with his
customary skill.

on The Jews in Our Time and what is

duction.”
Fitts's Aristophanes
Much can be done with a title; and
the “Thesmophoriazusse” of Aristo-
phanes, which looks about as inviting
as a quadratic equation in its original
appellation, becomes very bright and
gay and tempting when Dudley Fitts
rechristens it Ladies’ Day (Faber).
“Ladies’ Day,” or “Thesmophoria-
zusae,” is an abhorrent little play in
many ways. A parody of Euripides
and a personal attack on that great
playwright, it pours scorn on him for
his comparatively humble origin
(Aristophanes was an aristocrat), it
makes merciless fun of what Aristo-
phanes thought were oddities in his
style, it does not scruple to make
dangerous accusations of blasphemy
, and the like, and it shows the typical
outrage of the conservative at anything
new and vital.
Dudley Fitts says it was a “friendly”
attack; and we are told by J. A.
Symonds and others that Aristophanes
and Euripides remained friendly after
| it; but that is something this reviewer
has always rather doubted. The two
I playwrights may well enough have
] maintained tolerable public relations;
I but few writers are really very fond
j of the ants that bite them,
t However that may have been, what
must have redeemed the satire in its
own day was its brilliance of parody,
its fun and bawdry, and its liveliness
of action as Mnesilochos, the father-in-
law of Euripides, disguises himself as
a woman and breaks into the secret
rites of the women at the feast of the
Thesmophoria—with the sort of up-
roar, when he is exposed, that you
would expect.
Here, faced with the enormous
difficulty of making a parody of
Euripides interesting to our present
barbarous generation, Dudley Fitts, as
in his previous translations, has taken
extraordinary liberties with the text,
putting in, instead of parodies of
Euripides, scraps of Shakspeare and
the Border ballads, bits of scripture,
fragments of popular songs and
Heaven knows whatnot. The result, as
before, is a hotchpotch; and a better
procedure, as before, would have been
for Fitts to have written an entirely
new play, based on Aristophanes in
method and intention but satirising
Shaw or Eliot or Fry or any other
modem writer whom the author felt
inclined to parody. A genuinely
Aristophanic piece of work in modern
writing was “Myra Buttle’s” “The
Sweeniad.”
However, it is a most courageous
effort to revive the “Thesmophoria-
zusae”; it is lively, skilful and amus-
ing; and this reviewer’s only serious
objection to it is that the bawdy bits
seem self-conscious and stuck-on, as if
the translator, faced with the awful
necessity of practising a Rabelaisian
speech which came naturally to Aristo-
phanes, took a deep breath in his
library and said “Here we go.”
BIRD AND MOON
A bird, companion of this moon
That gropes with slender horns among
Black branches., lifts a pointed tongue
And silvers every stick and stone.
Each rounded hill, each hallowed plain,
Is furred with frost or eyed with dew
And waits the coming day, but who
Will animate the heart and brain ?
Old heart that sat among the stone
Until the making mind went forth
In a sweet parable of truth
And got with child this barren moon.

Reviewed Briefly
Adventures with Shapes: Anthony
Ravielli (Phoenix). Not, as the title
might suggest, a child’s guide to modern
art, but a study of the shapes of
geometry', Nature and outer space with
the idea either of making geometry
more palatable to the young or, simply,
of stimulating the imagination. It is
effectively illustrated by the author and
pleasing in its insistence that the
evidence of symmetry and design every-
where through the universe suggests
that there is more in heaven and earth
than science and the evolutionists have
yet found out. Schoolteachers and
parents should have a look at this one.

Critics’ London Diary: Kingsley
Martin (Seeker and Warburg). A selec-
tion from the pages of marginal com-
ment on politics, people, places, ani-
mals, flowers and London life in
general which Martin has been regu-
larly writing for the “New Statesman”
ever since he became editor of it in
1931. Much of the political comment
has lost its teeth by now, though some
of the glances at meetings and “inci-
dents” are still alive. There are some
good London anecdotes, particularly
from the blitz period; a few charming
notes on the author’s personal tastes
and interests; and some vivid sketches
of political and academic personalities.
But the selection as a whole seems far
too slight to justify enshrinement
between hard covers.

day-by-day account of his adventures
and the sights he saw make pleasant
and informative reading.
