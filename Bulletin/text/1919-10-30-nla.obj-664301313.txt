Author of “The Golden Bough,” “The

“The story is well told ; the Oriental setting is
skilfully suggested; there are excellent descrip-

best-drawn character is Dawson, Jessup’s valet,
imperturbable and self-effacing, but in every

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Lulled by the sob of a southern sea
He sleeps, who waked by the northern
foam,
To dream of a brown land, wide and free,
And make it his home;
Who sang great songs to its bluer dome,
And netted the strong, strange speech it
stirred
With the-mourning note of an older lay,
And swept from us like a wild, bright
bird,
Singing his heart away !
A fighter ever, a conqueror still,
With his last ride. ridden, liis last song
sung,
And the hemlock measure to drink or spill,
While the vain shouts rung,
Swift from the tourney his strong soul
swung
Out through the dark to the Giver of
Dreams;
Boldly as ever he rode fared he,
West with the sunset’s red triremes,
____.. Into his own country!
Small need had he of a graven stone
Who rests so well in his quiet place
Neath the drifted gold of his wattle, blown
Through her leaves’ green lace.
Nor ever in Hellas’ years of grace,
When Echo played with Olympian chords.
More proudly lifted a laurel tree
To point the grave of a lord of words
Sleeping in Thessaly !
Small need had he of a graven stone
Whose songs have rung through a con-
tinent
Like the notes of a morning bugle blown
In the winds’ high tent,
Reveille to lands magnificent,
■Where beggars are monarchs of Come bv

VICTORIA.
MARIE E. J. PITT.
A Book on the Cause of Every »
thing
A patient, painstaking and (for its size)
exhaustive book is Armed Peace, by W. S.
Davis. The title is half a misnomer, for,
though the armed condition was there, for
all to see, the peace was less apparent. Still
that halcyon lifetime before the deluge was a
sort of peace, because nothing much in the
way of disturbance happened in the Old
World save the Crimean War, the Russo-
Turkish War of the ’seventies, the three great
Prussian wars against Denmark, Austria and
trance, three or four Balkan wars, two
Japanese wars, two Austro-Italian wars, the
ooudan campaigns, a quantity of South Afri-
can wars, several dozen big massacres, chronic
insuilection in Crete, some Chinese civil
wars and a Chow revolution, the Carlist war,
the usual Afghan mix-ups, the armed fuss
in Tripoli, ditto in Persia, the Indian Mutiny,
certain doings in Asliantee, Further India,
etc., and the annexation of almost every place
by somebody, amid the enraged protests of
almost everybody. Apart from these and
similar trifles the Old World was steeped in
profound calm for 60 years and some months,
with most of the population in hard training.
When real war opened in 1914 ours was a
staggered community. It professed to have
thought that war had become impossible.
W. S. Davis, according to an introductory
statement, < “traces all the causes which led
up to the position” in 1914. He does con-
siderable work in that line, but, after all,
one might as easily trace back to 1869 all the
causes that led up to the dog-fight in our
street last week. Perhaps that dog-fight
became really inevitable owing to Columbus’s
discovery-of America, though some links in
• the chain of evidence are lost. No doubt
many things could be named that look like
causes of the 1914 tragedy. Thus three not-
able characters, Napoleon 111., Bismarck and
Kaiser William, had swelled head, and while
Bismarck was justified the other two made
a mistake about their heads. The utterly
impossible Turk was another probable cause.
1 here was trouble, too, because there weren’t
enough ports to go round, which is the cause
of the Italo-Serb squabble to-day; or enough
commeice and money to go round ; or enough
globe to go round. All look like causes; and
something the« Kaiser had eaten was probably
another. Anybody who looks at the typi-
cal Prussian, and notes the aggressive stick-
out ot his chest, will realise that he is a
cause in himself. But if it were possible, by
looking backward, to identify the moment or
person or event or spot which gave the world
Atal cant that made it turn over in
_yi4, then it should be possible to identify
■ e ,» er m or symptom which is even now pre-
paring the next world crash, possibly in 1954,
and to avert the trouble by squashing it flat,
xet no one can do it. There are obvious
angers in plenty, yet they may blow over,
and meanwhile some unknown person at
where m particular may be brewing a new
nna ,? n boilin g a fresh theory in a pot
and starting untold damage.
nlmLf genei 'M way the Davis theory is that

thi nw , .I lfc was impossible to stop every-

doimf w ,d : rm; \ r wa * st °PPed by somebody
Just what Mr. Davis thinks should have
d en done, and a new chain which wasn’t in
th of things took its place, and
though there was a Smash it may have been
a cl 'f erent smash. A book might be written
on the. averted causes which would otherwise
!^ e -J e i up to „ tke war that didn’t happen,
aa< l the world knew all about that war it
might _ne glad that it had the other one
instead. (William Heinemann, London.)
The Blind Signaller
Tom Skeyhill, the first Australian to re-
turn from Gallipoli blinded, made his way at
once to the platform, and found his country
waiting to hear him. His talk was fresh
(we hadn’t then heard many war stories),
his personality remarkable, his industry un-
quenchable. He had already written some
verses; but, though they made an appeal as
popular recitations, they had only a trace of
literary quality. -They were, however, very
human. Having found his feet as a public
speaker Tom went to America, and was for-
tunate in finding the chief public men of the
•country eager for help in rousing the people
to make war-sacrifices. Tom was taken in
hand, and, while doing great national service,
he found his own bank balance growing with
his popularity as a lecturer —and for one
“popular” lecture in Australia there are a
thousand or perhaps ten thousand in the
U.S.A. Better still, a succession of opera-
tions restored at least some vision; and with
that his thirst for a higher education in
literature grew keener. His charming sim-
plicity, among other things, secured him the
friendship of some of the best-known littera-
teurs of the U.S.A.; and they encouraged a
study and cultivated a taste which have
already had their effect upon his work. And
through it all he remains a fervid Australian,
almost pathetically anxious to do a real some-
thing for his country and its people. By the
last mail he sent a characteristic sample of
his latest work: —
IN MEMORIAM: “CURLY.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Red-headed, freckled and gay,
The spawn of an Irish sire;
But God never caged in clay
A heart of nobler desire.
Hot-blooded, awkward, and rough,
Heedless of life’s short span,
But made of that splendid stuff
Hall-marked on earth as “man.”
Quick-tempered, stubborn and wild,
Fond of the glass and of play,
But pure, and sweet as a child
When you blasted the crust away.
Indifferent, careless and slow,
Passing unheard in the night;
But first to enlist and go,
Baited and girt for the fight.
Christ Jesus, Master, 0 hail
This spirit of virgin gold—
Hero and knight of the Grail,
Cast in a commonplace mould!

TOM SKEYHILL, AUSTRALIA.
Novels Written in English
Lately I have read a good many modern
novels. Beyond the age of eighteen years,
this is a much over-rated recreation, leading',
by stages of depression and Pharisaical self-
sufficiency, to ultimate despair., The second
stage of self-sufficiency brought me to some
no doubt ancient conclusions.
Too many novels are written. And badly
and carelessly written. As free lances I
don’t think the authors could make a living.
With about six annual exceptions, all the
efforts are false in point of view, strained
and artificial in conception. The avalanche
correlates redundancy, which gives no chance
to the reviewer or to the reader to treat the
“literary” output seriously. It is like choos-
ing wallpapers. In the end all the designs
are the same; and the one that was savagely
despised at first is chosen, as the best.
In general, the modern English novel is too
stiff and reserved in details, and too wordy in
everything. The American equivalent slops
over and gushes in details, and is not wordy
enough in essentials. The Australian ex-
amples are concerned almost wholly with the
Islands, a station, or with larrikin crooks. To
me they do not seem over- or under-wordy,
and they certainly do not gush. They go
much more steadily and strongly to their
climaxes than do the English. and American
goods. Style has not stultified them yet,
either “finished” as in England, or stopping
over in flux as in America. You get what
the author means, and sometimes you get it
good. Hampered by rather poor turn-outs,
by conventionalities that London forgot de-
cades ago, by occasional solecisms and even
barbarisms, the samples to hand stick up out
of the wash somehow. They do not seem to
me (and I hold no brief for Australian
fiction) so utterly negligible as the rest.
Of the Northern Hemisphere novels
that ‘‘with a purpose” is artistically no con-
tribution to anything—certainly not to its
purpose. A purpose is mostly a lonely thing;
and if two or three are gathered together to
listen to it, they are in danger of becoming
enthusiasts and martyrs for their loneliness
only. _ This is as bad for the purpose and for
artistic work as too much beer is .for the
complexion. Apoplexy is the natural finish
of both.
Again, the historical novel is at its best
admirable only as an achievement in
“created atmosphere,” which is enough to
say that the atmosphere is not created; the
critic couldn’t admire it if it were. Some-
times a novel like “John Inglesant” comes
out of a man’s heart so simply and sincerely
that it automatically makes its medieval
color by the unbreakable power of sim-
plicity. That applies, too, to “The Cloister
and the Hearth”; but it does not apply to
“The Virginians,” which is apparently' the
model for 'the lately published historical
novels I have been reading. There is too
much “convincing atmosphere” in them.
Among other bad habits, the North still
goes in for the sex novel. No man should
write of sex questions who has not been
through sex storms. The eternal triangle
necessitates for its proper handling, if not
three points of view, certainly two —one on
each side. The actors in the triangle are
beyond the Christian advice and criticism
of the modern sex novel, and bevond its
penalties and threats—that’s wffiat put them
m the triangle. The husband is probably the
best man to put the thing on paper. He
always knows, two of the characters in-
timately. and often all three; and, if he will
wait until he is cool, he should be able to
write with the necessary artistic impartiality
and quiet. Unfortunately, socially he is not

For Sick Headache
Many people suffer at regular
intervals from sick headache. The
trouble is caused by accumlation
of poison in the digestive organs
and this poison produces nausea
and the headache follows.
These distressing attacks may
be avoided. Pinkettes are dainty
little sugar-coated ovals that act so
gently that they are the ideal laxa-
tive to use in correcting a tendency
to sick headache. They have no
unpleasant effect to make them
objectionable to the extra-sensitive
sick headache patient. Old fash-
ioned harsh purgatives will not do
at all in such cases.

The sun glints sharp on the burnished shields
As the longnecks cleave the brine.
Like emeralds gleam the distant fields
Where the Southland hauberks shine.
The thrall bends hard on the springing oar,
While seaward floats from the frighted shore
The low of the herding kine.
Now soon shall our weapons wake the tune
Best loved of the Northland men.
We’ll carve for the skalds a better rune
Than any within their ken.
Thor! send us enemies undismayed,
A worthy blade for each worthy blade
To try our mettle again.
And be’t the Valkyrs have touched my helm,
Shall I snap like a stem of sedge?
Like a crashing oak shall my limbs o’erwhelm
The twigs of their yielding hedge!
And my axe shall drink to its fullest worth
Ere they bear me to the reeking earth,
I, Sigurd, Point of the Wedge!
Then evermore in the sheltered dale
That nestles besides the fjord.
Shall Hilda the fairhaired ’wait the sail
That westering bore her lord.
Let be! I play but a maiden’s part
When thoughts of hearth-side quicken my
heart;
Mine is the Trade of the Sword.
The keels grate sharp on the shingled shore,
We leap to the crunching sand.
One berserk rush, as we charged of yore,
Shall tell that the stout north land
Speaks in each son with pitiless force.
’Tis Death or Goal when we lay our course-
Comrades, one grasp of the hand !

A Song of Great Days.
Some day I shall go out and find strange
lands,
Wonderful under new skies;
Touch the great statues of bronze which
cunning hands
Shaped-smooth when the East was wise;
Taste a salt kiss from the ocean's wet lip ;
Hear the Trades shout in the ropes;
Feel the quick shuddering joy of a ship—
These, are my hopes.
Some time the night will lie wrapped in a
swoon
Star-dusted and fire-fly lit;
Quick oars will splash in a sleeping lagoon.
Vague indigo shadows flit;
I will hear deep voices swing in an old song,
Hear the sly words as rogues scheme.
And the red thund’rous cry of a mad throng—
Thus do I dream.
Yet will I taste strange fruits, cloying and
sweet,
Learn the fierce love of brown earth;
Lose looming peaks in a soft, winding sheet,
Lulled by the spring water’s mirth;
Find in a world of snow low huts and cheer
Under a pale, frozen moon ;
Stumble upon a brown tavern and beer—
May it be soon !
Proud shall I walk on the globe ’neath mv
feet,
With my high head 'mid the clouds,
Finding all joys and all labors are welcome
and sweet.
Making bright banners from shrouds.
Still do I linger and dream, idly gay,
Feeling contented, in truth ;
Drab are the things which surround me to-
day—-
But I have youth !

An Old Harp.
The harp is built of cassia and cord;
And in its strings lie ancient melodies,
Forgotten tunes of wistful emptiness,
Thin, quavering sonatas, that afford
Small savour in their piping minor keys
To men of newer ways and stranger dress.
The jade upon the stops is dead, and dust
Lies mistily upon the sorrel strings;
The soul of it has rotted with the years.
And yet, in spite of verdigris and rust.
About the cords a cold, clear music clings.
Play it or not; you’d surely stop your ears.
You ask me why its melodies must pass?
Hark to the blatant jazzing of the brass !

The World of Self.
O inner world of Self! Pale phantoms pass
In the great outer w T orld as in a glass—-
A strange kaleidoscope that turns round me.
For ever changing, yet perpetually
The same, which in the reflex circling round
Attempts completion and a sense of sound!
The colors are the shadows of things past.
And each design the remnant of the last,
Which men still take in gravest prophecy
Of truths-to-he. O little world of me ,
Aloof from other worlds, how should I dream
That they have being when they only seem?
Within my world I, peerless ego, thrive.
Leaping to gladness, eagerly alive.
I fear no fear, no rite of sacrifice;
I to myself am king, and so uprise
Supreme in my own power made manifest
Within the secret closeness of my breast.
I am eternal in true fellowship
Of self; the bounties that my world lets slip
I share with no man, and, though no man
sees,
1 point the stars their shining destinies.
O inner world of Self, whose sphere is cast
In that oblivion which is first and last!

THE JELLICOE REPORT, AND SOME
OF ITS IMPLICATIONS.
It was inevitable that Admiral Jellicoe in
his report on Australian naval defence should
recommend a big navy ; for it is axiomatic
especially among admirals —that sea-power
cannot be gained or held “on the cheap.”
Many nations have tried to falsify the axiom
in the years that have fled since Tyre fell
because the Phoenicians let the Greeks out-
build them on the ocean, the latest of them
being Germany. Von Tirpitz thought that
he had discovered in the comparatively in-
expensive submarine a means of rendering
valueless Britain's costly monsters of the
Dreadnought class; and for a time even
Whitehall trembled. But the dream passed,
and half-way through 1918 the U.S.A. was
signing contracts for ships 660 ft. long (the
original Dreadnought is but 526 ft.), and
with a displacement of 43,200 tons, as against
the Dreadnought’s 17.900 tons. When Lord
Fisher went out of office in 1915 —by wlrch
time the German intention of crippling Bri-
tain on the sea with submarines was known
at the Admiralty—he left behind designs for
the Incomparable, which was to have been
1000 ft. long, with a displacement of 40,000
tons, and six 20in. guns. And the guns with
which the, Queen Elizabeth had bombarded
Gallipoli were mere 12-inchers! So naval
strategy is as it was. The submarine is no
more than a specialised instrument, invalu-
able for a few particular jobs, but as incap-
able in itself of winning a great war as the
torpedo or poison gas or the machines of
Archimedes the geometrician. The capital
ship is still the master. And the meaning of
it to Australia is that from £4,000,000 to
£6,000,000 will have to be spent annually
on naval construction and maintenance alone.
The disclosures of the huge cost of this
side of the nation’s defence was the least
delicate of the duties which faced the Ad-
miral. He had to break it to us that even
with this outlay our safety is not assured.
For that there must be co-operation with the
British Navy. But what exactly does “co-
operation with the R.N.” imply? Every
reasonable Australian will agree that there
should be the fullest co-ordination between
the two services. The disastrous futility of
anything else was quickly discovered by the
A.I.F. when it found itself fighting beside,
or “taking over” from, British units, whose
equipment and establishments differed, how-
ever slightly, from our own. Obviously any
rank or rating from an R.A.N. ship must be
able to go on board an R.N. vessel of a
similar class and know his way about as
though he had been reared in Plymouth. But
does this mean that the R.A.N. is to be per-
manently anglicised? Does it mean the
perpetuation of what one may call
the Jellicoe discipline, which may have
been all right for the pre-war R.N. A.B. (an
uncomplaining party who for 200 years, up
to August. 1914, had been content with a
shilling a day minus “stoppages”), but which
calls for very considerable modification in
the case of the modern Australian? Does
it mean the R.N. system of promotion on
a class basis? Or a continuance of the
existing living conditions at sea? If so, the
Admiral’s tour will have been in vain: his
recommendations might as well never have
been made; and naval defence,will come to
nothing worth talking about for lack of
Australians willing to join the service by
way of the lower deck.
* * * *
At present the R.A.N. is an almost
pathetically faithful imitation of the R.N.
Here and there it becomes a burlesque.
Some of the shore billets, for example, are
occupied by civilians —martinets of high naval
rank, who are more punctilious about their
dignity and that of “the Service” than the
retired admirals who hold analogous jobs
in England. There has been no attempt
anywhere to bring the R.A.N. into line with
Australian sentiment and temperament. In
a navy which was genuinely Australian there
would be free and full opportunities for
every boy of conspicuous ability to move
straight up from the lower deck to the posi-
tion of admiral of the fleet. In the R.A.N..
as in the R.N., such chances are, for all
practical purposes, reserved for a select few
to the detriment of the many. and. in the
long run, to .the detriment of the service.
Admiral Jellicoe, who knows nothing of
Australians, and who is an Englishman of
an age when the mind is unreceptive of new
ideas, plainly favors the perpetuation of the
old; system. So, naturally, do the vast
majority of R.A.N. officers. The R.N. offi-
cers felt similarly when the Mate Scheme was
first introduced. Lowerdeck ratings were
checked! in every direction, some of the
methods employed to discredit them being
highly ingenious. There were cases of men
being promoted to mate (a rank Introduced
by Winston Churchill, whose holder is
practically a sub-lieutenant) after they had
failed to pass their w.o.'s examination.
Vested interests are always concerned to
prove by such means that those who are try-
ing to break into their preserve are unworthy.
* * * *
And are living conditions on R.A.N. ships
to remain in line with conditions in the
R.N., whatever the latter may be? This is
another question which must have a tre-
mendous influence on the number of men and
the class of men offering for service on the
lower deck. Here, again, the experience of
some half-million Australians in the past
five years will enable the country to judge
the position fairly. Life on the Australia
is the equivalent of life on any ship of the
same class in the R.N. A mess deck on
this ship is 100 ft. x 40ft. It nominally
accommodates 200 men—-20 at each of
the 10 tables. In point of fact there
are from 30 to 35 at each table.
In this space the men have to eat,
sleep and recreate themselves. Members
of the A.I.F. will recall what nine weeks
of troopdeck life under similar conditions
meant. The naval rating may have 20 years
of it. The new Raleigh class of light cruiser
represents an experiment in the direction of
attempting to make life more endurable for
the R.N. lower deck. All sorts of special
contrivances have been introduced on these
ships, making for comfort. The sanitary and
bathing arrangements are improvements on
anything hitherto known in the R.N., though
incidentally they have long been in use
without detriment to fighting efficiency in
(he American Navy. Suppose the authorities
at Whitehall decide against the principle of
“pampering the lower deck” on the lines
indicated aboard the Raleigh, Frobisher and
the rest, will . R./ X. “co-operate” there
also? Or wi it prr ently launch out in-
dependently o f the R.N. on such changes—
in regard to disciplinary details, promotion,
living conditions and the like —as appear
necessary from time to time in view of the
differences in character and upbringing be-
tween the Australian and the born and bred
Britisher? Those are uroblems unexpressed
in the .TelLicoe report, but which will
have to be considered with it ! - Parliament
if the R.A.N. of the future is to be any-
thing more than a pious vision.
SECESSION DAY.
A while ago the late Lot seceded from
Sodom, taking with him his family—two dis-
reputable daughters and a pillar of salt—
because he realised that the proud city was
about to sink into insolvency. It did sink,
and the place where it was is now marked
on the map as the Dead Sea, and it has
paid nothing in the £ on its liabilities from
that day to this. A secession movement
based on very similar reasons has so far
developed in the northern part of X. S. Wales
that the district proposes to run a batch of
purely secession candidates at the approach-
ing Federal elections. Tearful appeals are
already being made to the malcontents in
the Foreign-trade press of the One Big City
to the effect that this is not the proper or
recognised or logical or legal way to go
about the business. But the fact is that
there is no legal or logical way to go about
the business. The crazy clause that was
inserted in the Constitution as an after-
thought provides that Sambo and his owner
can’t part except by the owner's full con-
sent, and if Sambo was strong enough to
force that consent he wouldn’t want to part,
for he would, by superior strength and num-
bers, have become the owner himself. Pre-
vious Australian secessions were the work
of the British Government; but that author-
ity gave up the right of interference when
the Commonwealth was established. The
Northern Rivers, to which the Northern
Tablelands have attached themselves, don’t
want to go insurrecting or Bolsheviking over
their grievances, so they propose to experi-
ment with a secession party which may at
least be sufficient of a nuisance to attract
attention.

If a line is drawn due west from Sydney
the district north of it represents three-
fourths of the State. If a line is drawn
due west from Newcastle the district north
of it stands for nearly two-thirds of the
State. The clumsy accident which pushed
Brisbane and Sydney and Adelaide and Perth
about as far south as they could go without
falling into alien territory or into the sea
has made the railway systems which con-
verge on these places in obedience to the
Big City policy curiously inefficient and lop-
sided. When the Commonwealth was divided
into military districts, with a view to effi-
ciency and without regard for tradition or
parish prejudice or State Frights doctrines,
N. S. Wales north of Kempsey was attached
to Brisbane, and in the absence of a city
and political centre of its own that was the
natural course. Most of the district would
rather belong to Brisbane than Sydney as
a matter of economy, but it doesn’t want to
belong to either. As a separate State it
might annex Brisbane and its immediate
surroundings, and let the rest of Queens-
land find a new capital, but that is another
mhtter. The North is the best watered and
most promising part of N. S. Wales, but it
hasn’t, a single railway striking inland to
bring the trade of its back country to the
coastal towns, and it is never likely to have
one while the present kind of Sydney control
lasts. In fact, no place in all N. S. Wales
bar Sydney and Newcastle has a railway to
connect the inlands with the ports, or is
likely to have under the One Big City mono-
poly. But. the North is madder about this
than the South because the furthest-north
trade is dragged at ruinous cost 000 needless
miles to Sydney, while the furthest south
trade is dragged only 300 needless miles.
Moreover, the furthest North Coasst has a
line, complete all but a single bridge, to con-
nect it with the port of Brisbane (50 miles
instead of 650 miles away), and the blatant
metropolitan arrogance which refuses that
much-promised bridge would, in more ex-
plosive countries,; be regarded as an excuse
for armed uprising. The last straw is that
the ruling political clique at Sydney has,
within the past few years, become an obvious
and dangerous lunatic. It is now raising
loans at 0 per cent, to carry railways 725
miles west from the capital through regions
of almost perpetual drought which show
one-twent’eth part of a 'human being to the
square mile. This is apparently done so that
a few cattle and some hides and rabbit-skins
may be brought for shipment at Port Jack-
son. In the ordinary course of events the
entire interest bill and a heavy loss in work-
ing expenses to boot will have to be met out
of'taxes, and'the North, which can hardly
get a mile of-lihe built westward from one
of its own ports, will' pay a very big share
of the bill. If the Northern part of N. S.
Wales should contrive to break away, with
a division of liabilities according to the
assets in the new States. Sydney and the
South will be left with almost the whole of
the hopeless properties and bad debts. When
a line is drawn across the Jstat-e the North
will give up all right,, title and interest in
the new 54 and 6 per cent, works and pro-
jects out beyond the limits of agriculture,
and all responsibility for the losses on them.
They are geographically attached to Sydney
by the One Big City policy, and Sydney may
expect, sooner or later, to be told to carry
them single-handed.
* * * *
A general revision of the foolish State
boundaries is coming, but it requires a deci-
sive secession movement somewhere to hurry
it along. The boundaries were at the be-
ginning a gamble in the dark. A settlement
was made on a few square miles of shore
that were partially known. Lines were
marked on an unreliable map. Then, after
the community was cdrhmitted to the arrange-
ment, men went out to discover whether
their inheritance included a navigable inland
sea, a network of rivers, a mountain range,
an active volcano or two. an earthly para-
dise. or just Sahara. The revolt of the
N. S. Wales Northern Rivers district against
its forced partnership in the network of dry
and hopeless 6 per cerit. railways which are
being built to carry a few odd rabbit-skins
to-the octopus city may jolt a whole recon-
struction movement into sudden activity.
DIRECT ACTION BY ARBITRATION.
There was a threatened strike on “the con-
struction” from Tarzali to Millaa Millaa;
and I met on the train from Cairns to the
south-western scrub country Police-magis-
trate Ferry and Tom Quilty, the Far North-
ern man of the A.W.U. There really had
been a strike for a day or two, the issuing
of an ultimatum and then a dead-end —a
strike not knowing what to do with itself,
and therefore doing the worst thing, which is
nothing. But after two days the engineer-in-
charge got the men to return to work pend-
ing inquiry ; and now the Police Magistrate
became an Industrial Magistrate and went
west and south with Tom Quilty, of the
A.W.U., Friend of the Court..
From Malaiida on to Tarzali dense woods
give place to the uv'iness of felled scab,
tall white stumps like isolated teeth in a
broken mouth, grass patches, and my Lady
Cow. It is all deep, red volcanic earth, led
banks and cuttings gradually being coven-d
with a curtain of creeping grass green as
baize, and red navvies—red as Edom by
reason of delving in red earth to pierce a
cutting and tie spur to spur with a bank. It
is for these red navvies that the Industrial
Court moves itself to Tarzali, there to hear
the cause in the ofiice of the construction
engineer.
In that shack, lighted dimly, I heard more
truth than in any case I ever knew in any
other court. For some were too straight to
lie, and others too simple. The case was
simple, too. A ganger disputed with a navvy
as to the place he had destined for a truck
of tilling; they got to fighting and the loser
used a'little of the language that is like
beauty because it is only skin deep. The
other men in the gang made it their quarrel,
asserting that to permit the hazing of one
man by another means injury to mateship;
and the broader mateship of all the men in
the other gangs on the construction sup-
ported them. For all strikes are not prompted
by the “greed” of labor that wants higher
wages so that it may get nearer to the de-
mands of the profiteer. Some strikes are
for betterment of conditions which wages
cannot satisfy; and some are because Bill
has been victimised, or thinks he has, and
Tom and George and Harry stand by him.
Mateship had gone so far in tins Tarzali
matter that the immoderates wanted to “yo-
ho” the ganger, which is to say disqualify
him on all railway jobs; and the Industrial
Magistrate and the Friend of the Court were
there to stop the injustice.
An Australian told his story. “Voice [the
navvy] emptied a load of muck on the bank.
Up came Peter [the ganger] and said, ‘Why
didn’t you put it there —not here?’ ‘You
told me*to put it here,’ said V'oice. ‘I didn't!’
‘You did.’ ‘You’re a flaming liar.’ Then they
shaped up and Peter knocked Voice dowm.
Voice got up and said. ‘You’re the taller man
and you’ve got the uphill on me.’ Peter
changed down hill and knocked Voice down
again. Voice said, ‘You’re a (bachelor's
son),’ and Peter went to hit him again.
Voice picked up a clod of dirt and threw it
at Peter and said it was like his vermilion
luck he couldn’t find a stone. After that
we all went home.”
A Maltese navvy was sworn. “Voycey is
putta da muck on da bank. Pietra he come,
and he say, ‘Why the hell you putta da muck
thatta place?’ Voycey he say, ‘You tella me
putta da muck here!’ Pietra he say. ‘You
bigga liar!’ Voycey lie say, ‘Per Cristo.
you greatta bigga liar!’ Then they
makea the fight.” At that the witness gave
a very realistic representation of a windmill
in action. “Pietra he knocka Voycey down.
Voycey he getta up, he say ‘(five me da up-,
ahill. I littla man.’ Pietra givea da upa-
hill: they makea the fight. Pietra knocka
Voycey down on the world. Voycey then he
say, ‘You greatta bigga figlio della
monde!’ Then Voycey getta piece of the red
dirt, throw at Pietra. Then Voycey say,
‘Per Cristo, my luck notta finda da
stone.’ Then we go to the camp and finish.”
Peter told the story in the sameway. He
had been good friends with Voice in railway
work for 35 years, and never had a quarrel
before. And then arrived the other of
these two big ’ children, although almost old
men in years ; battlers on many railroad con-
structions, makers of civilisation, useful t"
their community all their lives, their own
sense of honor discounted by people who judge
by appearances and hate the navvy language,
whereas some of the best men in the world
use language that some of the worst men in
the world shudder at. This party of the
other part was a work-worn little man of 55
or so ; later he told us he was a Melbourne
native; —“one time of the Booveroo push.”
He was very drunk, very loud, very argu-
mentative. but very fair. His drunkenness
was at first a comedy, and became on reflec-
tion a tragedy. The navvy’s life has been
bettered on later constructions by higher
wages and improved conditions. But his
tragedy is greater than that of most other
nomadic labor. He has no homej and for
that reason, to all intents and purposes, no
relatives, for all his working years. The
one palliative of his monotony is an occa-
sional spree, and, although he does not do
much of that either, because the paymaster
here tells me that he brings half the pay
back to the head' of the line in his capacity
of manager of the State savings bank at
the railhead, And, seeing this poor,
dishevelled, drunken ex-member of the Boo-
veroo nush and present navvy come, with
less than half a heart, to fight a stupid
schoolboy’s dispute all over again, any man
knowing human nature, and therefore loving
it and pitying it, had to pity Voice, the
little man who asked Pietra notta keep the
uppa the bill on him.
Maybe soipe such thought held the magis-
trate as well as the A.W.U. man, who had
had an informal inquiry of his own in
advance.. I do admire that magistrate’s tact
and patience. A fool full of dignity would
have committed the ex-member of the Boo-
veroos for contempt of court, or at least have
adjourned the inquiry and given the stupid
dispute time to take itself seriously. But
this man held them all. handled them all and
did the best thing to Voice, which was to let
him sound like his own name. Yet even
that drunken man didn’t get away a comma
from the story. “Y’see,” he said to the
magistrate, “you don’t know nothing about
this. You wasn't there. I do. an’ I was.
Peter comes to me an’ says. ‘Why d’yer put
the muck there?’ An’ I ses ‘Y’ told me to put
it there.’ An he ses ‘Bin’ liar,’ an’ I ses
‘You’re a bin’ liar,’ an’ he puts up his dooks
and knocks me down. An’ I gets up an’ I
ses, ‘Don't keep the uphill on me.’ Y’see. it
was a one-in-fifteen grade—course, you don’t
know nothin’ aboiih svnMn-fifteen grade,
but T do, an’ I’m tollin' ypy, • A one-inffiftoen

don’t know nothin’ about' that; an’ I do.
An’ I ses, ‘Don’t keep the uphill on me,' an’
Peter ses ‘Righto!’ an’ gives me the grade,
him bein’ a bigger man. Up we shapes,
an’ he knocks me down again. Then I
picks up a clod o’ dirt off the bank, an’
shies it at him. an’ I ses ‘.Test like me
flamin’ luck. I can’t find a stone!’” He
added, drunkenly virtuous: “Course, there
was bad langwitch- used—six a one halfer


dozen the other. But Peter’s all right! I
don’t say a word against him.”
“Have you and Peter been drinking
together since then?”
"A-course—me an’ him’s old friends. I
know Peter 25 years—one o’ the best. Cer-
tinly lie knocked me doAvn twice; but he
give me the grade an’ fair lightin’. Why,
Peter an’ me! Well, you don’t know, but I
knovv. Peter an’ me.”
“Now, Voice, be quiet for a moment. You,
Peter, must remember that the men must be
treated with the same respect by the ganger
as the ganger exacts of them.”
“I tell yer,” said the irrepressible voice,
“me an’ Peter’s old mates.”
"Do you want to stay with this gang,
Peter?”
“Any gang will do me, sir.”
“Then, remember what I’ve said, for the
sake of friendly and harmonious working,
iou are to be given charge of another gang,
and the engineer will decide which.”
So the Court adjourned sine die, having
arranged a trifle which might have grown
to a cloud big enough to darken that little
world. And it is nothing against labor on
that construction that such a trifle had to
be so settled. Smaller trifles than that have
lnade wars—rotten little personal quarrels
ot high-placed individuals have involved
nations in plague, pestilence and famine,
battle, murder and sudden death. The rival
republics of Pisa and Florence knew five
years of war because of a dispute over the
ownership of a cardinal’s lap dog; and the
workers of Europe are still paying interest
on loans for almost forgotten wars because
some loafer-prince did or didn’t marry some
lessness^* °*" Gn t a t e w * lo was e( l ua l in use-
There was a strike at Babinda mill for
genuine grievances, but the men had only
sufficient initiative to strike and then sit
T wn ; When the Industrial Magistrate and
the A.W.U. intervened the few new immi-
grants who were doing all the talking (be-
cause most of them can talk better than
they can work) said that interveners were
not wanted; but later the more sensible men,
who cared nothing for limelight, asked for
it. -they were out four days, and but for
intervention might have been out four
months. Thev had not a grievance which
could not have been settled without the loss
of a moment, but the men did not know
that and they were irritated beyond reason
by a tactless bombast which liked cracking
the whip over them. g
For I hold the expression, “if you please,”
I,specially when used on the high seas.
A particularly gentlemanly tone implants;
And so do his sisters and his cousins and his aunts.
So a railway-construction ganger is told to
treat navvies with respect, and the man who
domineered is relieved of relations with the
dominated. And gradually we oil the
machine that it may run sweetly.
Cantering back along the formation of the
railroad extension next afternoon we came on
two men at the entrance of a deep cutting
in the flaming red earth at the two-mile.
They were sitting together, engaged in the
very being of mateship, which is “having a

RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
“Not Negotiable.”
William M. Hughes went to Brisbane,
which is Kyan’s stronghold, to announce,
first, that a gift of some £25,000,000 would
be made to returned soldiers, and, second,
that the pensions to disabled soldiers would
be increased. Taking the latter first, it
will run the country into an extra expense
of £650,000 a year. Yet it is an absolutely
legitimate increase, for the damaged soldiers
need it and deserve it, and it is a burden
which this generation takes on its own
shoulders. The country would pay some
of its crippled defenders none too much if
it paid them ten times as much as they are
likely to get. But as to the fiat rate
gratuity, it is a vote-buying device pure
and simple; and it has the overwhelming
defect that it merely commits somebody else
at some future date to pay something. It
has become a question of who will bid highest
in promises for the soldiers’ votes, and
£25,000,000 is Hughes’s opening bid. The
money is to be paid in bonds marked “not
negotiable,” which means that they can’t be
put on the market and sold, but the holder
can collect interest on them, and the lump
sum will be gathered from posterity when
it becomes due. This introduces a new wild-
cat element into the borrowing scheme. The
gratuity can'T ne provided for out of taxes
within any reasonable time without much
more taxation or a heap of hard economy,
and neither of these things can be mentioned
by shambling, time-serving politicians just
before election day. It can’t be borrowed
in London, partly because that harassed
place isn’t advancing money just now for
election purposes, and partly because Bri-
tain is itself driven to float a big loan in
the United States and hasn’t much to lend
for any purposes. It can’t be borrowed
locally, for over the recent £25,000,000 loan
the Government only saved its face by
bringing pressure to bear on the already
over-burdened banks. It can’t be naid in
notes. The people use only about £20.000,000
worth of notes, the other £36,000,000 being
held by the banks, which are loaded below
the Plimsoll mark with paper that yields
them nothing. To force another £25.000,000
of paper on the public would reduce the
value and increase the cost of living tre-
mendously. So there remains the doing of
the noble deed which buys votes by the issue
of bonds. But if. the bonds were saleable
immediately the owners would rush them
on a market which is already tired of the
very name of bonds. Prices would go down
all round, and everybody who held a bond
or was interested in any institution which
held one would feel his assets shrinking. So
the last bankrupt device is to prohibit the
marketing of the military-donation bonds
during their term of currency, though, of
course, when they fall due and a loan is
floated to renew them the new bonds will
have to be of the ordinary sort, else the
public won’t take them. The idea is thus
to leave to posterity, not only the repay-
ment of the loan and payment of the bulk
of the interest payments on the loan, but
also the slump which may be caused by put-
ting the loan on the market. Of course,
Parliament hasn’t been consulted in the
matter. It was deliberately planned that
the present Parliament at any rate should
not be consulted. “Send me to the next
Parliament with a majority,” says the Prime
Minister to the Diggers, “and we will pay
jou £25,000,000.” Politics have thus become
an auction, at which Hughes on one side and
Tudor-Ryan on the other bid public money
galore as the price of office for themselves.
I»y the time they have raised their offers
to £100,000.000 or £200.000.000 the mass of
the people may decide that this sort of poli-
tics must end. If it doesn’t, there is no-
thing in thd world surer than that some
time in the future we shall be driven to
repudiate our debt.

The Buried Treasure Swindle.
These are some of the features of the in-
dustrial situation in Australia :
Australia owns its railways (except that they are
largely owned by foreign money-lenders) to the
extent of 22,181 miles out of 25,308. There are
thus only 3127 miles of privately-owned line, of
which 1488 miles are in the Labor State of Queens-
land. (These are the last official figures. The mileage
of private lines is now less.) Most of this private
railage represents Australian joint-stock capital, and
is more Australian than the State lines. There are
no local railway profiteers.
When the returns were last made up (1916) 911
per cent, of the land belonged to the State or Federal
Governments; 3 per cent, was in process of being
sold, and only 54 per cent, was absolutely in pri-
vate hands. Leaving out the innumerable holders
of small allotments, and reckoning only those of an
acre and more, the private lands in five States
(Queensland supplied no returns) and two Federal
territories were divided among 213,752 owners. Of
these only 84 had more than 50,000 acres, and 76
of them were in N. S. Wales. The big holders
averaged less than 90,000 acres each, and there
wasn’t one in the crowd who remotely resembled the
Duke of Sutherland in Scotland with his 1,358,600
acres, or Hamilton, Argyll, Beccleuch, Devon-
shire and other magnates of little Britain. Under,
the Federal graduated tax the areas grow smaller
every year.
Thanks to the same tax and other causes, slice))
farming, Australia’s biggest single industry, is lie-
coming a small man’s job. In the great sheep
State of N. S. Wales the sheep-kings* with 100,000
jumbucks or more numbered 73 in 1891, and only
two (2) in 1916.
Though there is more life insurance done in Aus-
tralia in proportion to population than in any other
country in the world, barring, perhaps, Maoriland,
there isn’t a single concern of any importance that
is owned by and run for the benefit of private capi-
talists in the English sense. The great bulk are
run exclusively for the benefit of the policy-holders,
who are practically the whole nation. Some are
run directly by the State. Whitaker's Almanac
enumerates 66 important British offices, and 47 of
them are run by private capitalists for their own
profit. Out of 14 offices which possess over
£10,000,000 of funds apiece 10 are private affairs.
So Australia is somewhat different.
The biggest Australasian bank belongs to the people
at large. So do the savings banks. The joint-stock
banks, barring the five absentee concerns, are owned
by such a multitude of Australian shareholders as
to be almost national concerns. There is not one
private banker of the type of Rothschild, Baring,
Barclay, Glyn, Coutts or dozens more that per-
vade London, and there never has been.
There is not one coal-mining magnate unless
Brown, of Newcastle, can measure up to the speci-
fication, which is doubtful. Twenty-eight coal stocks
were mentioned in last month’s Sydney share-list, and
they paid dividends on their wasting securities that
ranged from nil (five of them) to 15 per cent, (two
of them).
Australia doesn’t possess one real shipping mag-
nate, and never owned one in its life, though it has
paid 50 per cent, dividends to many foreign ones. It
hasn’t a meat firm like Armour's, with its 78 per
cent, profit, though it has a bit of cold beef on a
plate. Nor has it a beer magnate like Guinness,
whose concern is accused of making over £5,000,000
in a year, though there are brewery companies on
the share-list which pay from 5 up to 104 per cent.
It hasn’t one oil magnate. There is certainly an
imposing oil-importing co. 'registered here with a
capital of £1,600,000, but as only a single £lO
share is held in Australia there is little joy in that.
Furthermore, this great country can’t show a soli-
tary iron, steel or copper potentate amassing mil-
lions out of the blood and perspiration of the people
and making them call to Heaven for redress, though
it has smithies and horse-shoeing establishments. Its
biggest private shipbuilding monopoly would just
about make a dog-kennel for llarland and Wolff’s
place at Belfast. It doesn’t run to one manufac-
turing millionaire, and it is doubtful if it has a
living millionaire of any sort now. And no megalo-
maniac can be found now in the whole of the coun-
try who is building a palace for himself with a
view to “founding a family.” That habit died out
between 1880 and 1890, and it was never much of
a habit, anyhow. The palaces of those old days are
now flats and hash-houses.
Finally, the Federal Statistician calculates that if
all Australian incomes over £3OO a year were con-
fiscated (supposing people took the trouble to earn
them for purposes of confiscation) and distributed
among all the people of working age (14 and up-
wards) with less than £3OO a year, so wide is the
present diffusion of wealth that the benefit would
be 4s. sd. per week each.
Taking one thing with another the spectacle
of Hughes and Ryan and Tudor bidding
for votes, which mean office and salary, on
the promise each to go one better than
the other in digging up and distributing
the hidden treasure of the profiteer, is a poor
variant of the “Spanish prisoner” and his
swindle. That captive, allegedly languishing
in the dungeons of the Inquisition at Madrid,
has been getting money for years by selling
to fools the secret of a hidden treasure
which he can’t get at himself because the
Inquisition won’t grant him bail. There is
plenty of treasure in Australia’s case. but.
thanks to borrow and boom and burst and
loafing and importing devices it is quite out
of our jurisdiction. Bismarck started a
policy which dragged Germany out of a
ditch—not so bad as ours, yet bad enough—
and made it the boss industrial country of
the world bar one. But it was a 40-years’
work, and there is nothing in that for the
calamity who wants votes to-morrow and
doesn’t care if the world is dead 40 years
hence.
The Luck of John Turk.
According to a cable of last week, it is
likely that the idea of dividing Turkey
will be abandoned in favor of instituting
international control by England, France,
Italy and Greece, possibly with America
participating. If the mandatories are done
away with —and they have already been
responsible for much needless bloodshed —
it will be a tremendous score for the Un-
speakable. The talk of kicking him out of
Europe will die down; his hereditary enemies
will be far more likely to be booted out of
the territory which has accrued to him by
longi tcmporis possessio; and he will prob-
ably be “controlled” in the long run by the
light hand of Britain alone, since America
does not wish to share in the responsibility
and no other European country is in a
position to give effective help. This may all
be best for the peace of the world, even
though it represents the partial triumph of
unmitigated villainy. It certainly looks like
making the British Empire safer. There is
no more miserable weakling than the modern
Gyppo. Yet, unorganised and unarmed, and
with no real stomach for revolt, he has kept
the British fairly busy during the past 12
months. Picture the menace a disaffected
Turkey, concentrated on the south side of
the Bosphorus, might be to the Empire; or,
from another aspect, consider the hideous
expense the position would entail. The main
road to India is still through Persia, as it
was in the 18th century, when Nadir Siiah
broke through the north-west frontier and
actually got as far as Delhi. Even if the
Turk never revived sufficiently for further
operations on the grand scale, he might still
depredate, under favorable conditions, along
the Bagdad railway, in Palestine, and as
far afield as the Canal. The conditions pre-
cedent are being created by himself or his
agents. They are based on religious fanati-
cism; and if the Allies now change their
policy in respect of Turkey it will be in
deference to a sentiment which Britain,
anyhow, with its horde of MohammedanfUin
India and Provinces, can hardly afford to
flout. The average Roman Catholic is as
enlightened as the average Mohammedan is
illiterate. Yet the Catholic would not
placidly look on at the material degradation
of the Pope. The Sultan is the Pope of
Islam, and every true Mussulman is pro-
voked by so much as Turkey or the Ivhalif-
ate is humiliated- The British Empire has
on its hands at present the beginning of
Bolshevism in England: the usual Irish
question in an intensified form; an Indian
Nationalist movement, with a revolutionary
wing attached; an Egyptian question; the
eternal Afghan question ; and Mesopotamian
trouble, more or less on the lines of the
Egyptian row, and many smaller race or
class problems. If the Lloyd George Gov-
ernment takes steps to placate Turkey the
move will not only soothe a present enemy
who wants to be a friend, but it will spike
the guns of unnumbered hordes of Moslem
agitators who are exploiting the position of
the _ Khalif to inflame Islam everywhere
against Britain. In the circumstances it
looks as if the punishment of the Turk will
be dropped, like the hanging of the Kaiser,
self-determination all round, the Freedom of
the Seas, and a lot of other things which
in the present state of the world are outside
the range of practical politics.
Bog Wanted: Highest Price Given.
Three-fourths of the Northern Territory's
troubles and much of its losses can be traced
back to the Loan Disease. With a railway,
and the train loaded with some, white pas-
sengers from Adelaide and Melbourne and
Sydney coming in as a matter of course
every evening, Darwin would be just an
ordinary spot trotting along as ordinary spots
do. It is the vast isolation which makes
it a place of extraordinary prices and wages
and ideas, where men go mad. and inflated
pretenders who think themselves,out of the
reach of the law begin to set up Provisional
Governments after the manner of General
Blanque de Gory setting up a weekly re-
public in an isolated corner of Mexico, and
it becomes a serious matter to look askance
at a slaughterman driving to his job at
the meat works, because he may he the new
Robespierre. If the place was within three
days of a southern capital instead of being
outside three weeks, it would be part of
the general scheme of things instead of being
a freak. The cost of completing the line
would probably be less than the cost of the
Canberra capital, and it is almost certain
that the bit of work required to fill in the
broken link would pay in two ways: (1) it
couldn’t make the loss on the unfinished line
any worse, while it might make it better; and
/2) it would make the Federal lands in the
Territory accessible, so that they must yield
some shred of revenue. But the Loan dis-
ease has always intervened. The loan money
to finish the line wasn’t exactly available
when the place was taken over, and it was
contrary to the old dunderheaded precedent
to do any work of that sort with revenue
money even though revenue was available.
Like a legendary Scotch engineer who de-
clared railways in a level country impos-
sible ‘because there were no hills to put
your tunnels through.” Australia’s rulers
hold that a railway without a mortgage on
it would be too light and would blow away
Also, it would be irreligious. That the
Fisher Ministry had revenue money to
spend was proved by the lavish fashion in
which it spent money in buving Cocked Hats
and Brass Hats and Gold Stieks-in-Waiting
for the northern freak, while the one plain
thing it really wanted to end its freak career
waited for the loan that never came.' In'
the matter of waiting for the high-priced
loan where public works are concerned, and
meanwhile finding millions of revenue with-
out apparent difficulty for amusing jobs to
fill in time, State and Commonwealth Gov-
ernments are alike creatures of habit They
are so accustomed to he in a bog of diffi-
culties that if there is none handy thev
will advertise: “Bog Wanted. Highest Price
Given for Second-hand Embarrassments.”
The Useless City and the Essential
Railway.
The political Boys of the Old Brigade had a.
field night over the Canberra capital ques-
tion in the House of Reps, before it drifted
to dissolution ; but while they wept over this,
alleged unfulfilled obligation there was a
strange silence over one of.a thousand times
more importance—the completion of the Port
Augusta-Darwin railway. Yet the relative
merits of the two matters are worth com-
parison :
The taking oyer of the Northern Territory on
terms to be arranged was authorised in the Con-
stitution just as much as the establishment of a.
Federal capital in N. S. Wales. But it was part
of the original Constitution —not introduced later
by a political ..fake.
The agreement to take over the Territory on
terms dates back to 1907, so it is older than the
Canberra agreement.
In return for its release from certain debts and
the promise that the Transcontinental railway should
be finished, S. Aus. handed • over something sub-
stantial —624 miles, of railway and 523,620 square
miles of. land, including a bigger extent of well-
watered country than any other State except Queens-
land possess.es, and with no less than 10 rivers
which the official year-books class as navigable for
fairly large vessels and for considerable distances.
N. S. Wales, in return for the advantage of the
Federal capital, gave - 900 square miles, no rail-
ways, and the Cotter.
Ihe obligation to finish the Port Augusta-Darwin
line is not only based on a pledge to S. Aus. and
on the fact that S. Aus. paid a big consideration.
There is also a, pledge to the British Government
taken over from S. Aus. and part of the bargain
on which S. Aus. held the Territory.
The Port Augusta-Darwin railway is wanted to
make a\ailable 523,620 square miles of Federal pro-
perty, now almost useless and a breeding-ground for
comic-opera revolutions. The Canberra capital isn't
wanted for anything urgent except to let Federal
members enjoy swimming in the Cotter. If Aus-
tralia changes its mind again about Canberra--
which it has a perfect right to do, the place being
established by a mere Act of Parliament which can
be repealed and which rests on no sacred bargain
with anyone—the property can be sold. There are
no buyers for the Northern Territory except, per-
haps, the, Japanese Government. We must keep
it’ and in a Ice the best of it.
The plea for urgency in the matter of Canberra
is that a million pounds of Australian money is
going to waste while the place is in a state of
suspense. 1 hrec times as much Australian money
is going to waste while the two ends of the
north-to-south railway remain unconnected. This
work was commenced with the reasonable idea that
it would pay when it was a through line, with a
great port at each end and a vast extent of well-
watered country in the northern section, for it
isn’t a desert line in the same sense as the one to
Kalgoorlie. But ' nobody expected it to pay if it
stopped when the worst desert was crossed and the
good land was hardly touched. The fact that a lot of
money is buried in the North-South railway enter-
prise is advanced as a sort of reason why no more
should be done. The fact that, a lot of money is
interred at Dryberra is put forward as a reason
why more should be spent instantly.
The North-South railway is wanted for defence
more urgently wanted than in 1913 when the dis-
tant Hun was the bugbear. If there is a bugbear
now he is nearer than the Hun. Canberra as a
necessary fortification has never been even men-
tioned.
If this is the Day of Atonement, when Aus-
tralia begins to honor its forgotten obliga-
tions, the great railway calls for first atten-
tion.
Our Mediaeval Jury System.
The Bi leetin heard lately a cry from seven
jurors of Sydney. It came in a dimly-typed
volume entitled “Demand of Jurymen' for
Reforms.;’ Every rhetorical method was
employed: the dramatic (“Standing at the
bar of Justice the malefactor will gaze with
an eye of anxiety, perhaps, as is often done,
wetting his parched lips with his tongue”) ;
the language of veiled menace (“We happen
to hold, however cheaply we may be esteemed,
a very impregnable position, and happen to
have sufficient intelligence to know our
power”) ; and the appeal to patriotism (“Our
scheme is, in our opinion, the method most
suitable to a real democracy which regards
the slave-capturing Arab compulsion of con-
scription as anathema”). Their scheme is
“free-will volunteer jurymen of the income-
tax class . . . such jurymen, as a re-
ward for their patriotic and public service,
to be entitled to the honorary title of J.P.”
This paper, while it has no use for any such
notion, cordially agrees that our Jury sys-
tem calls for revision. One reason is con-
tained in the “demand” itself. Its authors
remark naively: “In the secrecy of the jury-
room points and experiences that never oc-
curred to either Judge or barristers are com-
mingled with the evidence of the'court-room.”
But juries are not supposed to find on such
lines. They are limited to matters of fact
produced in the evidence. Lord Ellen-
borough ruled that any juror who disre-
garded those limits should be dismissed, his
place being the witness-box. It is notorious
that the innocent accused in a criminal case,
or the litigant who is convinced of the justice
of his cause in a civil suit, prefers a Judge
to a jury any day.' The English Judicature
Acts, as amended in 1883, recognised this
Lord Lindley said (Timson v. Wilson) :
"The effect of the new rules is to make trial
without a jury the normal mode of trial ,
except where trial with a jury is ordered
under rules t> and 7a, or may be had without
an order under rule 2 ” In Chancery and
Admiralty the jury has been wiped out alto-
gether. There are two main classes that ap-
prove ot the widest application of the Jury
system—criminals and lawyers who use it
to spin out trials. Most other thinking citi-
zens favor an extension of the English sys-
tem —with the reservation, of course, that a
jury should still be the only body to handle
a serious criminal matter. But at the same
time as cases sent to juries are decreased in
number an effort should be made to raise the
mental level of jurors; and that can best be
done by modifying the exemption svstem.
under which more than half of the intelli-
gence of the community never sees the inside
of a jury-room.

Merit v. Privilege.
“Hooge” : The Bulletin has been discus-
sing of late ( apropos the necessity of
securing the best brains possible for the
administration and training of the Australian
Army) the Duntroon graduate, the civilian
who obtained commissioned rank in the
A.1.F., and the pre-war militia officer who
served abroad. Very little has been said
about the man who in pre-war days was an
n.c.o. in the Permanent Forces, afad who did
well overseas. Here is a typical case: —
A. 8., previous to being permitted by the Defence
Dept, to enlist in the A.1.F., was a Permanent n.c.o.
with 64 years’ exemplary service. He left as an
n.c.0., and in France he was appointed to com-
missioned rank on the recommendation of an Aus-
tralian Regular officer, and without previously attend-
ing the usual six months’ cadet school in England.
After carrying out his duties as a subaltern for
some months, he was wounded in one of the big
engagements in 1917, and awarded the M.C. He
came back to his brigade as adjutant, and carried on
until the unit was demobilised. He was “mentioned
in despatches,” and finished up as a staff-officer.
The war being over he can either go back now to
the Permanent Forces with his old rank or seek
the aid of the Hepat.
It is, of course, true that this man, like
others in his position, was warned that if
he did his duty there would be nothing
coming to him in the way of promotion on
his return —assuming he did return. But
the country has the right to a say in the
matter. The modern requirement every-
where is efficiency. In the Army it is being
deliberately sacrificed in the interests of a
privileged class. Thus men such as A. 8.,
tried and tested soldiers of the best sort,
will have to serve, if they rejoin, in some
cases under officers who were in the Per-
manent Sendee before the war, aud who
proved failures on active service; while
there are instances of officers who flatly
refused to volunteer, who are still in the
Army, and who have under them n.c.o’s
who have been awarded as many as three
decorations, in addition to gaining their com-
missions abroad. To put the situation on
its lowest level, it is not business to keep
such men on to the exclusion of those who
have proved their worth as soldiers in the
only testing-ground. It would pay the
nation well if the Government compensated
the inefficients (there being no system of
Army pensions) in order that they might be
forced, without hardship, to make way for
the experts.
The Rifle.
“Blanc” sums up the lessons of the war so
far as the rifle is concerned: —
'towards the end of 1916, when we were up to our
necks in the Somme nmd and the abomination got
info the rifle mechanism, and when the trenches
were close together, we all felt inclined to dump our
rifles and depend on “Johnny Mills.” At that
stage the main value we placed upon the rifles was
that they were good handles for our bayonets.
Bombs became the fashion, and they got such a grip
on many that hundredweights of staff instructions
were issued to repopularise the rifle. One Australian
battalion, in fact, spoiled their rifles for rifle-fire by
awing about a toot off each barrel in order to use
them for firing bombs, the shorter barrel sending
the 230 z. Mills 30 to 50 per cent, farther than
the unbarbered barrel. This caused such a sensa-
tion among the heads that urgent orders came out
that no rifle was to be altered in any way for bomb-
ing work.
Then came the failure of April, 1917. To the left
of Bulk-court the Germans attacked the Tommies.
The grey waves advanced without a casualty, for
the Tommies were waiting to bomb them when they
came close enough. “Let Jerry coom!” they con-
fidently exclaimed. Jerry did come. At 40 yards
from the Tommies he got' a shower of bombs ; but
before the defenders had finished ducking from the
fragments of their own bombs, Jerry was amongst
them. Near Lagnicourt on the same day the Aus-
tralians were attacked by 11 waves of Hun. Our
rifles, assisted by two Lewis-guns, immediately got
to work. Not a Fritz reached within 200 yards of
us. After a few minutes’ rapid melting away, the
enemy broke pell-mell and ran wildly into his own
barbed wire, where later on over 1000 dead were
found hanging. These two examples so struck the
heads that a special Army Order mentioned them.
Then the troops got another fashion. With a
Lewis-gun to each platoon and plenty of Vickers
machine-guns, it was felt by those who forgot the
carrying problem that the rifle was a very small
affair. The British Fifth Army rout was a rude
awakening. The tremendous waste of bullets by
the machine-guns soon used up the forward stores.
Then the rest was easy for Fritz, for artillery can-
not Stand without the protection of the small
bullets. If Gougii’s army had had the faith of the
“Contemptibles” in their rifles, the Germans, if not
actually stopped, would not have advanced 35 mil's,
practically without a casualty, and the Australians
would notjbave been called upon to advance through
the retreating Tommies without supplies, except
what they carried, and to hold on to the line they
reached for a week until the supply organisation
was again working efficiently. When the 4th Aus-
tralian Brigade, under General Brand, pushed into
llebuterne they didn’t have enough small-arm ammu-
nition ,to keep Lewis and Vickers guns going for an
hour, and there was not a single battery of 18-
pounders to support them ; but they had enough car-
tridges to keep up a rifle defence against the then-
cheeky Hun until he found his advance was at an
end, which was several days later.
One of the keenest rifle-fire instructors in the
A.I.F. was Colonel Harry Murray. The men of the
13th Battalion can remember their few “rest”
periods, when day after day they poured, under his
keen supervision, all kinds of rifle-fire at all kinds
of targets. Yet Murray is a machine-gun expert—
one of the greatest in the world. He wouldn’t allow
that, though, to blind him to the supremo importance
c? the rifle.
Treasurer Watt evidently looks on Can-
berra as a quiet spot far from public opinion
and the madding crowd. In a moment of
passion he told the House of Representatives
that he would gladly move there to-morrow
to get away from “the incessant attacks,
nagging and influence” of the Melbourne
papers, and presumably to avoid similar
unpleasantness from Sydney, Brisbane and
Adelaide papers. Certainly there have been
complaints. Papers have nagged about the
Bureau of Science and Industry which iias
been spending money for a year or two without
Parliamentary authority: about Pearce’s
trip to London without Parliamentary sanc-
tion to pretend—he and his family and his

suite—to do work which a paid expert was
doing already ; about the tariff which has been
solemnly promised so often yet never comes;
about the ordering of ships on a large scale
without a pretence of consulting the Legis-
lature ; about the inability of the Hughes
Ministry to prevent Provisional Govern-
ments taking over control of one-sixth of the
Commonwealth; about the glaring attempts
to freeze out the Anzac tweed industry, ap-
parently because it was a payable occupa-
tion for crippled soldiers and interfered with
the land-jobbing industry; about the appal-
ling muddle made over the commandeering
and control of metals and wheat; about the
lack of any serious effort to keep faith over
the Northern Territory railway; about the
many illegal or irregular appointments to
the civil service; about Hughes’s con-
temptuous refusal to tell the common herd
of members whether he is or is not going to
spend £10,000.000 or £20.000.000 or so in
gratuities to returned soldiers, he being the
one god-like and irresponsible distributor of
gratuities; about Millen’s statement that
Australia doesn’t require new industries;
and about lots of things. But these ghosts
will follow even to Dryberra. The kooka-
burra will cackle about the matters, and the
rabbits will shake their heads over them,
and even the native solemn bear will ponder
on them in his gum-tree.
Surgery and medicine both made wonderful
strides during the war; but the most amaz-
ing discovery the P.M.O.’s branch of the
Defence Department has to its credit
is a new cure for consumption. Hitherto
the profession has had an idea that
the T.B. should go away to some quiet,
open-air place, free of dust and noise,
such as the Blue Mountains. The new
idea is to be put in operation at the
Consumptive Home for Returned Soldiers at
Randwiek (Sydney). The returned man with
the disease is to be cooped up in a hostel
in the main Randwick-Coogee thoroughfare
for trams and traffic, with grounds that an
energetic curate could kick an elephant across.
It is within a couple of miles of the ocean,
and handy also to the 10 million flies which
pervade a suburb spotted with racing stables.
If the new treatment answers health authori-
ties will no doubt send malaria cases up to
New Guinea or the African Gold Coast, aud
put the shell-shock cases on testing in a
detonator-factory, while miners’ phthisis
cases will naturally go down a Bendigo or
Broken Hill shaft for six months. There
are quite a lot of possibilities opened up by
the new scheme. One of them, incidentally,
is a further inquiry into the administration
of the medical side of the Defence Depart-
ment. The Bulletin lately gave abundant
reasons why that inquiry should be made;
and the establishment of this hospital for
consumptives at Randwiek adds itself to
them.
The latest sop to public opinion in Bri-
tain and France is a promise that the Clown
Prince and Rupert of Bavaria shall be
bracketed with the Kaiser for trial. But
how get delivery of the goods? If the Armis-
tice terms had begun with a demand for the
surrender of these Hun personages, talk of
trial would have had a more genuine ring.
The Kaiser, the Clown and all their blood-
stained relatives might have been had for
the demanding a year ago. Now that they
have remained so long in possession of their
liberty, possession looks very like nine points
of the law.
“Fall of Petrograd! Flight of Lenin and
Brookfield! Disappearance of Trotsky and
Considine!” These ought to be the news-
paper headings, but they won’t occur, for
the sufficient reason that all excent Trotsky
and possibly Lenin seem to have fled already.
Even a few months ago there were poli-
ticians in Australia who proudly said they
were Bolsheviks and intended to reproduce
the beneficent and successful Bolshevik
regime here. Now, after two years of blood
and rape and torture and hunger and ruin,
the monstrous edifice is tottering to its
fall, and its old friends have almost ceased
to mention it. If you ask one of them
what lie thinks of Bolshevism he will prob-
ably answer with a vacant expression that
he is a teetotaller himself, but doesn’t miud
a milk-shake.
An official economist no more foolish than
the tens of thousands who approve of go
slow and the darg came before Victoria’s
Profiteering Commission when it was inquir-
ing into the price of bread. As secretary of
the Bread Carters’ Union he objected to any
introduction of the block system of deliver-
ing the goods, whereby overlapping would be
done away with, figuring that 200 of Mel-
bourne’s 400 breadcarters would be thrown
out of work, besides numerous blacksmiths,
coachbuilders and saddlers. But why not
go the whole hog? If every breadcarter were
prohibited from carrying more than six
loaves in his cart at once, there would be
work for 10 times as many carters and no
end of wheelwrights, etc.
A Melbourne man with the suggestive
name of Pippey wants to start a Society for
the Discussion of Public Questions, and this
paper doesn’t wish him much luck. The
Commonwealth has 14 such societies already
—each with its own Hansard —-to say
nothing of unions, leagues, benefit societies,
progress committees, synods, conventions,
pub parlors, street corners, post-office steps,
and the Lord only knows what or how many ;
and in the multitude of discussions it is hard
to see anybody doing a good, useful day’s
work. If Pippey will form himself and his
friends into a Society for Suppressing Super-
fluous Discussion and Getting a Lot of Work
Done in a Hurry, this paper will have pro-
found respect for him.
The very latest N. S. Wales loan
in London is to cost practically 6 per-
cent., and at present prices and wages
it takes fully £lO of 6 per cent,
money to build as much railway as
could be built 30 years ago with £6 of 31
per cent, money. And whereas in 1889 the
Ma State was still spending its 31 per cent,
money on railways in the counties of Cum-
berland (then with 267 persons to the square
mile) and Northumberland ("34 per mile),
it is now building out in Blaxland, Mossgiel,
Manara, Livingstone, Sturt, Nicholson and
such-like counties. The best of them had at
last census two-thirds of a person to the
square mile; the next best had two-fifths;
another had one-sixth ; and the other three
one-twentieth. The last census showed them
all as losing population; in fact, counties in
the West, such as Sturt, Waradgeree and
Cooper, began to have railroads as far back
as 1882, and kept losing population just the
same. Nobody has the gall to profess seri-
ously that the sinking of money on which 6
per cent, has to be paid in these regions at
present costs is investment with a view to
profit. It is merely a helpless way of find-
ing work of an unskilled and temporary
variety to keep people going. But meantime
we keep a million foreign people going at
skilled and regular toil, manufacturing and
handling the goods we import.
Hughes had plenty of talking material
when he invaded Ryan’s stronghold at Bris-
bane. Ilis condensed tale was that under
Ryan’s control Queensland, instead of be-
ing the cheapest State to live in, had become
almost the dearest; that the rise in the cost
of living was greater than in any other
State; that the profit shown by the rail-
ways in pre-Ryan days had turned into a
record deficit; that dissatisfaction was so
great that Queensland had as many labor
disputes as all the other States put to-
gether ; that the unemployed, as shown by
trades-union returns, were more numerous
in proportion to population than anywhere
else; and that under Ryan Queensland had
altered from being the State with almost
the minimum of taxation to the one which,
for weight of tax burdens, leaves all the rest
out of sight. Yet another point is this.
Very many State Premiers and Ministers
have quitted their provincial sphere to
climb into Federal office —Deakin, Lyne,
Forrest, Barton, Turner, Dickson, Lewis.
Kingston, Fysh, O’Connor, Isaacs, Play-
ford, Fisher, Dawson, Reid, McLean, Symon,
McCay, Pumpkin Smith, Best, Cook,
Glynn, Foxton, Irvine, Wynne, McColl,
Jensen, Watt, Boynton and Speaker Holder
are 30 to go on with. Every man of that
crowd appealed to a constituency in his own
State and took the chance of unpleasant
facts of his State career coming out to
spoil his re-election. Ryan sets up a new
precedent—it looks rather a cocktail kind
of precedent—by applying for his Federal
job in a State which he has never served
and which isn’t even his birthplace, and
selecting a constituency 715 miles from his
old haunts. Ryan, applying for re-election
to a Queensland constituency in 1922, might
be thrown out by reason of his State per-
formances ; but those who know his State
performances will find little joy in abusing
him at West Sydne3 T by telegram or long-
distance ’phone.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Ritchie, Public Works Minister of S. Aus.,
who has been thinking and talking River
Murray all his life, has visions of the Com-
monwealth making a Mississippi of it. By
way of encouragement, and seeing that a
start has already been made in locking the
stream, he is working at a scheme under
which S. Aus. will provide a harbor for
ocean-going vessels at the river-mouth—
whether at Goolwa or Victor Harbor is a
matter for the engineers to say. Even if
nothing is done to equalise the flow far up
the river and its
tributaries, and so
command the wool
and other traffic
of as far inland as
Bourke and Bal-
ranald, a shipping-
port is badly
wanted for tin*
wheat and the fruit
which the new
Murray lands are
producing in
rap idly-increasing
quantities. A t
present they are
not merely drawn
away from the
ocean, but are
dragged over the
crest of the one
sizeable mountain
range which coastal
S. Aus. owns in
order to reach

things considered,
probably the most

The tears of an old Gallery hand :
N. S. Wales Opposition-leader- Jack Storey is
worse placed for want of effective support from the
rank and file in the Assembly than any man in his
position during the last 20 years. The public thinks
he should do as well as MoGowen did when leading
the Opposition. But look at the men Mac had behind
him. There were Holman, Griffith, Nielsen, Beeby
and Donald Macdonell, any one of whom could on a
day’s notice cut a Bill to ribbons in a speech to
which the House would listen and which the papers
had to report. They could frame amendments in
Committee taking the sting out of an objectionable
measure, which even a strong leader like Carruthers
couldn’t get his followers to oppose. But what
lias Storey got'? There isn’t a man behind him—now
they have taken Osborne—capable of criticising a
Bill without emptying the House, or of framing an
amendment that doesn’t sound like a Scotch joke.
Baird, Vic. Minister for Labor, is to be
asked by the Trades Ilall on Nov. 5 to pro-
vide that 4U hours a week be the limit in
Wages Board determinations. Any time
worked after 40 hours will, of course, have to
be paid for at overtime rates. And if it were
granted there would be a deputation a week
afterwards protesting against the increased
cost of living. The Trades Hall thinks you
can eat your egg and still hatch a chick.
The Australian Parliament closed up once
more without passing the Act to legalise the
Bureau of Science and Industry. But the
Bureau on its way, collecting its wages,
making new appointments, and poring over
the question of the effect of prickly-pear on
rabbits and the reason why emus can’t run
as fast against the wind as with a gale
behind them. It is one of the small things
which teach Parliament how superfluous it is.
If the northern third of N. S. Wales sets
up for itself as a separate State it will be
the third in point of size—a little bigger than
Victoria and a great deal larger than Tas-
mania. Its strong point will be that when
the State debt is divided according to the
value of the public-works assets in each sec-
tion, it * will be the least embarrassed and

consequently the least-taxed bit of the Com-
monwealth. Probably its liabilities will
amount to £3O or £35 per inhabitant, leav-
ing Sydney and the country attached to it
owing perhaps £9O or £lOO per head. West-
ward from Sydney the country is a gridiron
of largely unprofitable railways. In this
central region the lines are as far as pos-
sible on the horizontal plan to bring as much
trade as possible to Sydney, while in the
North they tend to the perpendicular to
carry as much trade as possible past every
place that isn’t Sydney. So a division of
things will have curious results.
“Employers of rural industries are ex-
pressly excluded,” say the daily paper re-
ports, from the operation of the N. S. Wales
law by which employers, in addition to paying
the present minimum wage, are to contribute
to a fund for the support of the employees’
children. Somehow the Backbone of the
Country always has to be excluded from bur-
dens of that sort. By much exclusion and
by having his produce carried by rail at less
than half cost, also with grants or cheap
loans to assist him in fallowing and such-
like, and with child labor, occasional seed
wheat and lots of new loan railways, the
Backbone struggles along somehow till the
drought comes. It might not be a bad thing
to concentrate more on manufactures which
haven’t such a lamentable tendency to be on
the medical-attendance list.
The workings of the mind of an old R.N.
autocrat are prettily revealed by one par. of
Jellicoe’s report:—
It would add to the authority of the Naval Board,
and would be a sign of that authority, if, with the
sanction of the Home Government, some distinguish-
ing flag were granted, the flag to be flown only when
the Naval Board is represented in a port or on board
a ship. It is suggested that the flag should be
saluted with 15 guns.
Dun-brown Australians will find it hard to
understand how the purchase of a new flag
or the unnecessary expenditure of gunpowder
on a special brand of noise will add to the
efficiency of the navy. Mackenzie, manager
of Sydney Ferries, goes home every evening
on one of the co.’s craft, and if it hoisted
a flag, and if the flag was “saluted” by the
other ships throwing 15 shovelfuls of coal in
the air, the shareholders would call round
with a strait-jacket. Experts go through
the public departments every little while and
point out possible economies. The Navy
would think it blasphemy if it was visited by
a business-efficiency expert. But that reform
will have to come.
J. D. Fitzgerald, one of the Ministers in
the N. S. Wales Leg. Council, throws a
bououet at that Chamber:—
Often we dare not divide the House because the
result would be to show there was not a quorum,
and the House would be counted out.
It is the natural result of the system of
nominating members for life. Many are
tired men who have given up the struggle
for a seat in the Assembly ; others are men
who have blazed up with sudden political
enthusiasm, and, as a rule, they soon get
cold; others merely push in for the lime-
light and the gold pass. Not more than
one-third of the members give their job
serious attention; the rest only turn up when
they are either dragged there by a friend
or by their own interests, financial as often
as political. In a democracy the Chamber
is a howling anomaly.
Westralian Premier Mitchell is an opti-
mist. Ilis first Budget forecasts another solid
addition to the State's ghastly deficit, bring-
ing it over the two million mark. Yet Mit-
chell calls the outlook satisfactory, and
promises that there
shall be no fresh
taxation. He is
ban king on a
bumper harvest,
which there may be,
and on the Hamp-
to n Plains find
blossoming into a
real goldfield,
which isn’t so cer-
tain. The West
needs population
desperately, but to
get new settlers
who will pull their
weight is, a prob-
lem. With the
greater part of the
revenue going to
meet the interest
bill and sinking
fund charges foi
the colossal loan
jag of the past
eight years, the
T reas ur e r has
hardly a feather to
fly with. And buying raw immigrants and
planting them on the soil costs a neap of
money in a country like Westralia. It is
liable to cost even more to keep some of
them alive after they are planted.
On the day the Federal Parliament was
ambling its last lap President and Speaker
rebuked Ministers, as servants of the Crown,
for daring to interfere with Parliament by
sending its minions, the members of the
Economy Commission, in inquire into ex-
penditure of the people’s money on Hansard
and such things. Watt humbly said he
would see that no Parliamentary privileges
were infringed. Infringed! Why, for two
and a half years Parliament has let the
(Government do as it liked and said, “Yes,
Mr. Hughes!” The “rebuke” of Mr. Presi-
dent and Mr. Speaker is simply sublime
humbug in the circumstances.
Webster, stung by some unfeeling remarks
of the Economy Commission, has published
a paper to prove that at the Post Office he
has saved more than three millions. The
arithmetic of it is quite easy. The deficit
in 1915-6 was £815,990, which was £313,732
less than that of 1914-5; and next year it
was £452,576 less; and in 1917-8 there was
a surplus of £387,382, which was £1,017,104
better than the experience of 1914-5. So
if you don’t take any notice of the fact
that in the three years the net loss was
£105,754, but merely add the larger deficits
which Webster might have made but didn’t,
it is as plain as Webster can make it that
he saved £1,783,412. And if to the £1,783.412
you add £1,046.344 which Webster didn’t
save, spending it instead on salaries and
motor-cars and mail services, then it is also
perfectly clear that he saved £2,829,756.
Exactly why Webster will make these
ridiculous claims isn’t obvious. There is no
need for them; for without talking nonsens'
he could show that, though, like most other
people, he has had to spend a good deal of
money, his accounts now exhibit a small
surplus where previously there was a large
deficit. If Webster were a horse he wouldn’t
get credit for being a good hack through
claiming to have won seven consecutive Mel-
bourne Cups and a slack-wire walking com-
petition. 6
There ar e few' sadder figures in the N. S.
Hales Assembly than Jas. Macarthur
Onslow. Onslow is frankly a Conservative,
it you had told him, before the war, that
he would one day have Holman as his leader
lie would have neighed in passionate dissent.
Now he has to follow either Holman or (un-
thinkable degradation!) .Storey, or get out.
So, like Bavin, Ley and a few others, he
compromises by giving Holman nominal al-
legiance, while, in effect, getting in his road.
The fool-position is the direct outcome of
the Party Government system, without which
all concerned could speak and act honestly.
The hypocrisy which the party system
involves was well illus-
trated in the N.S.W.
Assembly the other
day. On the Chil-
dren’s Maintenance
Bill—a Government
measure designed to
camouflage some of the
consequences of the
new minimum wage—
Ley had delivered a
speech directed at the
weaicnesses of the
measure. Holman fol-
lowed, and announced
that that sort of mis-
behavior wouldn’t be
tolerated, and made the
Opposition a present
of Ley. Yet the very
next evening James,
the Minister in charge
of the bill, announced
that the thing was
found to be so full of
defects that it would
b e withdrawn and
another substituted.
COLONEL P. T.
OWEN,
Director-General of
Commonwealth Works
and Railways.
Captain Blackburn, a mild-mannered voung
man who was South Aus.’s first V.C., 'prac-
tises law in Adelaide, and is a Nationalist
member of the S.A. Assembly, talked this
way to Adelaide citizens in the Town Hall
recently:—
Taking the Murray River frontages, for over 100
miles, excluding fruit settlements, such as Waikerie,
Pyap and Lyrup, only one block is owned by an
Englishman. Yet there are returned soldiers who
have been waiting six, eight and 12 months or more
for land. In some cases men who were interned
have been allowed to go back to that land. The
question to be faced is whether men who have been
proved to be disloyal should be allowed to keep that
land. Unless something is done soon, unless some
action is taken quickly that will clean up this
country, the Digger will do it. I don’t think I
will be accused of being a direct actionist, but if
something is not done to clear out the disloyal Ger-
man, take the land he owns and give to the Digger,
we Diggers will do it ourselves. We are going to
keep this country for Australians. We are going to
take from the disloyal alien every foot and inch of
land that he owns.
Blackburn asks others to face a situation
which he isn’t facing himself. If the "dis-
loyal alien” hasn’t a right to a foot of land
while the Digger wants it. he hasn’t a right
to other things. It is just as equitable to
take hritz’s business and Wilhelm’s job as
it is to take Carl’s land. And if business,
land and job all go, then clearly the disloyal
alien must go. If Blackburn will stand up
for that there will be logic in his talk.
Where, as in the Northern Territory, the
people are not given a chance to choose their
spokesmen by ballot, the loud talking is
naturally done by the wildest mob-orators;
and, there being no election figures to con-
fute them, of course they claim to repre-
sent the people. The chances are they don’t.
No wild Bolshevik ever represented the
Northern Territory in the S. Aus. Assembly :
mostly,' in fact, the Iteps. were even anti-
Labor. The same thing is liable to happen
at Broken Hill. There was a Local Govern-
ment conference in Sydney lately, and, when
it met, Labor mayors and aldermen flocked
up to the Mayor of Broken Hill to hail a
brother from a far-away town, where, ac-
cording to the stories, Labor rule is supreme.
“But look here,” said this mayor, “before
you go any further, I’m not a Laborite, and
there isn’t a Labor majority in the Broken
Hill Council.” Yet, from a distance, no-
body would guess that there were more than
about two anti-Bolshies in all Broken Hill.
Labor in Victoria is sticking to its old
pals. The recent Senate selection ballot gave
the Labor nomination to Senators Barker
and Barnes and ex-Senator Ted Findley,
while the Red Flag fluttered feebly near tlie
bottom of the list. The Labor estimate of
the voting strength of parties in Vic. to-day
is: Labor 45 p.c., Farmers’ Union 20 p.c., ail
other parties 35 p.c. As the F.U. is now
very much “out” with the National Federa-
tion and the A.W.N.L.. both these bodies
having expressed themselves hotly about the
“intrusion” of the union, it isn’t unlikely
that all three Labor men may be returned.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The candidate appealed to the electors to sup-
port his ‘broad progressive policy.’ ” —Any paper,
any day.
There came a man to town one day
Who had a dog to sell;
And much the good man had to say
And many tabs to tell
Upon the people to impress
Its valor and its cleverness,
Till all the country was agog
With wonder at the virtue and the value of this dog.
He hold the bag on high, and said:
"I ask you to accept
This mastiff as the finest bred,
Tne loveliest, most adept,
The strongest, swiftest of all dogs,;
No tvkc that runs, or lopes, or jo*»
Can with this ciog or mine compare.
He is a treasure in a home; men praise him every-*
where.
“My dog," said he, “will guard your house,
He’ll watch your little dears;
He’ll hunt the sly, destroying mouse,
And bite the profiteers.
His watchful care will keep your weal
From all the terrors that may steal
Upon the limping heels of war.”
His hallelujahs for the dog swelled to a mighty roar.
They bought the dog, they paid the cost
(No price was thought too high) ;
They sought then, but his speed was lost,
His valor none could spy;
He did not seem at all well bred,
His beauty and his strength were fled,
He was not broad, he was not tall—
In point of fact, though long they searched, they
found no dop at all!

When the South British accounts closed on
August 31 many months had passed since
Germany had cried enough and war risks
had begun to vanish. In these circumstances
a considerable falling-off in premium income
might reasonably have been expected. There
was a shrinkage, but it was surprisingly
small; for every £lOO of net premiums re-
ceived in 1918 £9B 4s. sd. was collected
during the past 12 months. Yet not only
was the marine tariff reduced, but in N. S.
Wales and Victoria workmen’s compensation
rates were cut to such an extent that there
is no longer much, if any, profit in the
business. However, apart from further ex-
pansion of operations, the South British was
no doubt helped by the heavy importations
following upon the Armistice and by mer-
chants seeking cover against fire for the
abnormal stocks which rolled in upon them.
Early in the year insurance managers must
have felt somewhat nervous concerning
these exceptionally heavy and expensive
accumulations; but any fears they may have
entertained were dispelled when it became
clear that no slump in prices was imminent.
In a rising market, and with bankers
obliging with accommodation to finance
stocks which cannot be realised right away,
the insurance man’s nightmare, the moral
hazard, is a tame animal. Still, the South
British loss rate last year was slightly more
than for 1918. though much more favorable
than in pre-war terms. This shows the
co.’s underwriting record during the war,
and the progress which lias been made over
a quarter of a century : —■

The surplus, before providing for unexpired
risks, w T as £112.347 in 1018, but the smaller
income, a slightly less favorable loss rate
and heavier expenses reduced last year’s
surplus to £04,125. For 1014 it was
£75,061.
These figures, of course, do not take into
consideration interest earnings, which
amounted to £59.422 last year after deduct-
ing income-tax. The way in which profits
have been helped by larger funds and im-
proved interest rates is shown in this com-
parison of the earnings of the co.’s assets-
-1914. . £41,542 I 1916. . £43,511 I 1918.. £51,929
1915.. 42,898 | 1917.. 48,084 | 1919.. 59,422
During the past three years the interest
earnings have alone been sufficient to meet
the handsome dividends which have been
distributed, which means that except for the
few thousands that have been appropriated
for a staff provident fund, all underwriting
surpluses have gone to still further
strengthen the funds that protect policy-
holders. Capital and reserves, after the
distributions to shareholders, amounted to
£1,280,975, equal to over 198 p.c. of last
year’s premiums, an unusually large pro-
portion. Put another way, apart from in-
coming premiums and current interest
earnings, there were resources sufficient to
cover losses equal to the total of the past four
years. And, further, these funds are ex-
cellently placed. At A ug. 31 no less than
£720,971 was in British and Australasian
War Loans. Because of these heavy war
investments, there have been considerable
changes in the disposition of funds since
1914:
r~ 1914 rs , 1919 .
Public securities £200,124 21.8p.c. £868,330 52.9p.c.

Stocks and de-
bentures .. 31,925 3.4 ~ 69,701 4.3 „
Thus 76.9 p.c. of all assets was represented
by gilt-edged securities, deposits, cash and
book debts at August 31. Note also that
over 25 p.c. of the book value of premises
has disappeared during the past five years,
the management apparently establishing in-
ternal reserves in the same way as the
banks. This premises item will, however,
expand during the current year as a result
of the new building now in course of erec-
tion in Sydney.
Shareholders have had a gorgeous time,
of course. Paid capital is half a million
(200.000 shares of £2 10s. each), but of that
£400,000, or £2 per share, represents re-
serves capitalised within the past seven
years, during which period no less than
£830,000 has been distributed in dividends.
On the money actually put into the co. by
shareholders the present 11£ p.c. is really
equal to a return of 571 P-c. p.a. These
dividends are the sweeter, too, because, as
already remarked, interest earnings alone
provide the feast. The war was very kind
to the South British ; during the five years
since 1914 it has been able to disclose
£709,003 of profits, compared with £521,700
for the previous five, and, after the hand-
some distributions to shareholders, has
tacked £482,735 to visible reserves and writ-
ten £40,000 off premises. In five years the
co.’s position has thus been strengthened
by reserved profits to an extent at least
equal to present paid capital.

Before the war the Union management had
been rapidly acquiring new business; but
when the great trouble began it put the
brake on hard. Fresh advances were re-
stricted and the Society’s position was made
safer also by reducing liabilities 20 p.c.
During the past year, however, the directors
decided that the future looked all right;
hence they sold their War Loan holding and
undertook further liabilities so that they
could plant a record crop of mortgages. This
shows how new business has been written
each year since just before the war: —
1914 .. £38,478 I 1917 .. £17,415
1915 .. 19,700 1918 .. 30,554
1916 . . 20,453 | 1919 . . 42,845
The £42,845 loaned during the year did not
nearly meet the demands of borrowers, for
“applications were largely in excess of
funds available.” This naturally put the
management in the position of being able to
select its new business. But even then a
cautious eye was kept on valuations, and
larger margins were required to protect the
Society in the event of trouble following upon
present abnormal conditions.
Though there is now nearly £lO,OOO more
advances on the books than at any previous
time, liabilities are a few thousands less than
before the war. A further £2798 of perma-
nent capital has been got in during the past
four years, while the comfortable margins
between profits and dividends have also
helped to provide funds. Liabilities and
assets over a number of years are shown

For every £ of outside money in the busi-
ness there are thus mortgages with a “pre-
sent net value” of £2 4s. 3d., so depositors and
other creditors seem to be very well protected.
Shareholders are doing well, too; consider-
ing the competition in building-society busi-
ness, and particularly the inroads made on
the cos’, fields by the State savings banks,
a net return of 10 p.c. is good. And .since
only 8 p.e. i.s being paid to shareholders,
future dividends are being helped and fur-
ther protection is afforded capital by the
reserves which arc accumulating.

The 25 per cent. div. looks very sweet, but,
as the profits column shows, only 16 p.c. of
it was earned during the past year, the bal-
ance having come from undivided surpluses
of previous terms. The latest run was dis-
appointing, for though everything went well
on the co.’s Malayan property—crop antici-
pations were exceeded —the market for the
product in Singapore was very sick. This
table, showing production, costs and prices
realised, puts the record of the past seven
years in tabloid form: —

lhus the Singapore price last year was less
than one-half the 1913 average. But the
tact that Bukit Kubu could make 16 p.c. on
its capital under such adverse conditions il-
lustrates the possibilities of rubber cos if
they experience anything like reasonable luck
on their plantations and are helped by the
market. For instance, had this concern last
year received the 1916 price for its product
it would have been able to show a net profit
of oyer 60 p.c. on its paid capital. The re-
duction in costs shown above is, by the way
even better than it looks, for whereas in
the earlier years only one-half of general
charges were debited to cost of production
the figures now include 85 p.c.
The Bukit Kubu Co. has now been going
years; but it started with 170 of its total
ot boo acres already planted. For the pro-
£l2,ooo was paid, and since then
122,590 has been outlayed on development,
® tc -» while buildings and plant have called
tor ±4690. All this financing has been done
on a paid capital of £30,000: but during re-
cent years profits have helped to meet devel-
chai’ges > the co. having accumulated
±12,813 of reserves as at June 30. The finan-
cial position at that date was quite comfort-
able : only £3481 was owing to sundry credi-
tors, while there was £5777 in verv liquid
assets. The co.’s labor team of 223 is a
mixture of Tamils, Chinese, Javanese and a
few assorteds, but no Bolshies —it shows
“none of the unrest noticeable in other
parts of the world.” says plantation-
manager Phillips. In fact, were it not
for the continued rise in the price of
foodstuffs, the manager reckons that lie
“would have no difficulty in cutting
down wages to pre-war levels.” During the
current year lie hopes to reduce f.o.b. cost
of production to per lb., and estimates
at least a 210,0001 b. harvest. The market
is also expected to improve—recent prices
have apparently been round about the 2s.
mark —so, provided trouble does not hit the
plantation, the co. should have a very profit-
able run this year.

Considering that Sydney was practically in
close quarantine for some months with ’flu
and tha* the shipping strike further inter-
fered with business, the results for the year
were surprising. Gross trading profits were
£35,863, compared with £29,568 for 1918 and
£23,222 for 1917. And while this trading
surplus has expanded by £12.641 in
years, expenses increased by onlv £3979
from £16,799 to £20.778. Of course, as a
set-off to the ’flu and strike there were the
•armistice and peace jubilations, and, no
doubt, the return of the Diggers has helped
earnings greatly. Still a net; profit, equal to
almost 14 p.c. of ordinary capital, after
meeting interest on first and second deben-
tures, paying S p.c. on £7OOO of prefs. and
setting aside about 144 p.c. of the book
value of plant and furniture in a deprecia-
tion reserve, is a remarkably good record
for a residential hotel which has had its
doors open practically only three years.
But when the ease with which the 10 p.c.
div. is now paid to shareholders is considered,
other things had better be kept in mind. Of
the capital in the concern only £77,749 has
been put up on the security of ordinary
shares. Another £7OOO has been raised on
8 p.c. pref. shares. Besides the share
capital the co. has £50,000 of debentures,
increased by a £lO,OOO issue on second
mortgage, the total debt on this ac-
count amounting to £60,538 a year ago. The
hotel has thus to feed substantial creditors
before thinking of a banquet for its share-
holders; and the other way of putting it is
that in years better than normal the ordi-
naries are liable to have a particularly good
time, while in years worse than normal they
will suffer because the business must first
feed the people whose bite is fixed, no matter
how poor the results. That there has been
a banquet in face of numerous difficulties —
six o’clock closing, influenza, loss of tourist
traffic, soaring costs, etc.—is eloquent
evidence of efficient management, as well as
of the present abundance of money. In
addition to setting the co. on a dividend-
paying career, the directors have also been
able to improve the co.’s position somewhat
during the past three years:—
1916. 1919.
Liabilities .. .. £69,944 £64,480
Liquid assets.. .. 4,869 17,097
Excess liabilities .. £65,075 £47,383
Since, the latest balance £3887 has been
P a id in divs.; deducting that, the excess of
liabilities over more or less liquid assets has
actually been reduced by £13.805 in the
three years. Meantime ' £1476 more had
been put into fixed assets; but £l2OO fur-
ther capital had been raised. There has
thus been an improvement of about £14,080
tlie , c °.’s balance-sheet position since
1916, though £4BOO of this is in a reserve
for depreciation of plant, furniture, etc.,
representing almost 30 p.c. of the book
value of those items. Usher’s has made a
very promising beginning.

With the Peace Loan out of the way the
Bank of N. S. Wales is now going after the
fresh capital the directors have Jong been
anxious to raise. At the last balance the
management was holding just over £8 of
outside money for every £1 of shareholders’
funds, and even in this very strong old
financial institution such a proportion is
wide. Further, the directors have been in
the position that they could easily find pro-
fitable employment for further funds. It is
now proposed to increase paid capital from
four to five millions by the creation of 50,000
new shares of £2O each. Proprietors are
offered one new share at par for every four
at present held, payable in four quarterly
calls to October, 1920, or in full in advance
and carrying full dividend rights. Share-
holders meet on November 28 to discuss the
proposals.

The strike at Broken Hill still drags on.
and all the mines are idle, as they have
been since May. It is the most hopeless, dis-
spirited strike that ever was. In Broken,.
Hill’s former big troubles there was en-
thusiasm and movement—very energetic
movement now and then. This time there
isn’t even spirit enough to bring a decent
meeting, together. Ask the average man
what it's all about and he doesn’t know.

dunno.” Two-thirds of the man would turn
it up willingly—probably four-fifths of them.

get to work and bring things to a head ; but
if you look at the acres and acres of Pt.
Pirie covered with stacks of smelted metal,

you will realise why the cos. are not desper-
ately anxious to get the wheels moving again.
Within a few weeks, however, Judge
Edmunds will deal with two or three mat-
ters affecting the trades at the mines. After
that the cos. will get to work and offer the
miners terms (they know’ them already).
Then probably, in order to save face, about
the most hopeless lot of leaders that ever
had a big strike in hand in Australia w’ill
take a ballot; and the thing will be over.

The Electrolytic Refining Co. issued a cir-
cular last week advising customers that 96
p.c. ot the copper which came into a refined
state at Kembla between October, 1918, and
June 30, IJI9, had been sold by the Copper
I reducers, Assoc, at £9B 9s. 9d. per ton net.
lne circular states that “quite a consider-
able proportion of the tonnage of copper sold
has not yet been paid for.” Also that “of the
proportion which has been paid for only 98
p.c. °f the proceeds has so far been received
from the Copper Producers’ Assoc.,” the re-
maining 2 p.c. being held by the assoc, “until
linal adjustment of the pool.” In order to
square off any producer who is becoming
tired of the business, the Electrolytic Co.
otters to settle up now, and pay him in full
tor aJI the copper he has in the pool at £9B
Js. Jit per ton. How good or how bad
Kembla s offer is cannot be calculated. On
appearances the wise producer will decide to
accept payment now for the 96 p.c. that has
been sold, and take his chance as to what
the remainder will fetch. Decently handled,
it ought to bring well over £lOO net after
allowing for interest charges. But the small
producer gets very tired of part-payments,
and he will mostly decide to take the £9B 9s.
9d. now and be done with it. After waiting
for a year to learn what his copper fetched
he is inclined to think there was something
wrong with the last whisky he had if you
tell him that_96 p.c. has been sold at £9B
9s. 9d.. that 15 n.c. of that has been paid for,
and 98 p.c. of that 15 p.c. is represented by
cash in the pool, and that the rest may come
in some day.
As a business proposition the thing is too
stupid for words. It is not the Electrolytic
Co.’s fault. The co. and possibly the Cop-
per Producers’ Assoc, have been simply told
what they were to do, and, like dutiful chil-
dren, they have doubtless complied. But if
the Copper Producers’ Assoc, is to justify
itself, it must now get its own brains to
work. The circular of the Electrolytic Co.
is the first intimation that the small pro-
ducers have received that the copper has
been put into a pool; A pool may mean any-
thing. What sort of a pool this one is, and
how it is worked, perhaps even some mem-
bers of the Copper Producers’ Assoc, do not
know. Certainly the small producers know
nothing of its workings; and that, on the
face of it, is wrong. It is bound to lead
to discontent. The small men were forced
in, and ever since have been in the position
of having to take what is offered, without
knowing the how or why of anything.
Judging by the information contained in the
circular the pool has been arranged on a
period basis. If so, then there is a heap
of trouble looming up, not only for the
small producer, but for the larger cos. It
will interest the small man to know exactly
how the pool is worked. Perhaps the solver
of all metal difficulties. W. M. Hughes, will
supply the information.

Westralian Government Geologist Gibb
Maitland has angered some Hampton Plains
option-holders and . dismayed others with
his report on the new finds. The most
severe blow is his declaration that the Cele-
bration line is not a continuation of the
Roulder-Horseshoe-Ivanhoe ore channel, but
that the formation is a parallel of the Somer-
ville-Woolabar belt. This contention is
hotly contested* by a number of mining men.
who claim that it is not borne out by field
geologist C. S. Honman’s comprehensive
geological survey made six years ago. The
rocks enclosing the Celebration lode are
claimed to be similar to those at Kalgoorlie,
yet Maitland is alleged to have put aside
this evidence and to declare that the line of
lode belongs to a geological series that has
never produced an ore body, and which has
so far spelt ruin to capital. Incidentally,
Honman, in his report published three years
ago, stated that there was “no reason why
lodes should not be discovered in the future,
especially in location 50 and location 48.”
* # * •
An old friend of The Bulletin at Hamp-
ton Plains: —•
To the eye the Celebration is another Boulder,
Ivanhoe, Horseshoe -or Lake View, but I doubt if the
values are so good, and I do not think that the
geology is identical. But it is undoubtedly a fine
development, probably the best in Australian gold-
mining since Kalgoorlie. Whether it will continue
in length remains to be proved; so far it has been
traced on the surface at least 1100 ft south, but
there is an ominous silence concerning values. In
the Celebration values at 100 ft. are not so good as
in earlier sinking—the first 70ft. averaged 2oz.
The country has been pegged miles in every direc-
tion, and the prices asked for leases are outrageous.
I could have secured no end of options, but the terms
staggered me and I refused to touch anything. The
basis of all options is six months; but it is impos-
sible to do much in that time considering there is
no labor available, no transport and no water.
A good deal will probably be heard of Westhead’s
show, about six miles south of the Celebration.
There is a fair amount of gold in cleavages, but I
doubt if there is anything in it for a co. O’Don-
.nell’s, a mile east of the Celebration, is also showing
some good stone —but that is all that can be said
for it so far.
Personally I was very much impressed with
Slavin’s lease, seven miles south-east, though some
expert opinion is adverse to it because the sulphides
are on the surface. Snatch samples I took assayed
2oz. 6dwt. and 2oz. 13dwt., and half a dozen dish
prospects washed gave good tails of free gold from
sulphide ore. But the make is not big as in the
Celebration. Slavin’s is about Bft. wide and the
chief values seem to be in 4ft. in the centre. But
1 see no reason why it should not continue in length
and depth. It is proved on the surface for 600 ft.
* • * •
Bullfinch Proprietary is dog-tired of try-
ing to make ends meet at Bullfinch, and is
acquiring four leases at Wombola, about 14
miles east of the Celebration, which were
recently pegged by Charlie Jones, one of the
West’s best-known prospectors. Since the
beginning of the year gold valued at about
£50,000 has been dug out of the co.’s pre-
sent show, but the cost of getting it has run
into thousands more. The management has
funds available to develop a new property.

From Westonia:—
Edna May Central has agreed to pay the cost of
pumping Edna May water for a month, and there-
after will have the right to acquire any portion of
that co.’a pumping plant at valuation. There is
more in this than meets the eye. Should Central
permit water to rise in the Edna workings to the
225 ft. level, it could ascertain the extent to which
its own mine would be affected by the flooding of
the Edna. In this way Central would know the
additional pumping power required in future, and
to what height it would be safe to permit water
to remain in Edna workings. In any event Central
appears to be in for a depressing time. Heavy ex-
penditure on pumps is as certain as that the Central
ore shoots are becoming shorter and narrower with
depth. The mine has done little in the way of
dividends to date; it is likely to do less when
it is called upon to bear the total cost of pumping.
It is taking the Deeps a long time to unearth
the many thousands of pounds profit which have so
often been officially reported to be in sight in the
mine. One statement read: “The ore above No.
5 level should yield, and will yield, with reason-
able management, £BO,OOO to £lOO,OOO in divi-
dends.” Since that statement appeared, much ore
has been extracted above the No. 5 level, but not
one penny has been disbursed. Possibly, when the
Deeps receives the Central ore bodies at a depth
of about 1500 feet, the run of dividends will com-
mence. Perhaps.
Consolidated is in a bad way and may shortly ex-
pire without having accomplished more th"n those
who knew the field expected it would. The ground
is becoming more difficult to work, and ore reserves
are rapidly diminishing.
When the history of Westonia is written it will
read something as follows: “There was sufficient
payable* ore in suitable proximity to justify the
installation of one good mining, treatment and
pumping plant; the installation of three additional
outfits was wasteful and quite unwarranted.”

In his latest on Langi Logan South
(Vic.), Geo. Bryant tells how the Broken
Hill miners failed when put into the deep-
leads on his patch. They contracted 18s.
per fathom for panelling and 6s. 6d. per
foot for truck-roading. These prices were
4s. and Is. 6d. more than the co. had pre-
viously paid, but Bryant decided to give it
a go. Three parties of Barrierites and a
local crowd were set to work, but when
Bryant measured up the costs he found that
the panelling had run away with 295. Id.
per fathom and truck roads 7s. 7d. per foot.
The trouble was the 11s. per day minimum
wage, for with that to fall back upon there
was no inducement for the soeeding-up. of
work in the mud of the lead. Bryant claims
that conditions were easy, and that he went
out of his way to help the newcomers, but
that it would take a Madame Berry to stand
up against such a minimum wage unless
trained deep-lead men held the picks. When
Bryant decided to close down on extrac-
tion once more, lie set about opening up the
gutter south, where he is getting tempting
dirt. For a while he ran up an ounce aver-
age in the northern section; south, off No.
2 rise, he got 25dwt. stuff ; and so far as
he has gone round No. 3 rise his dirt from
drives has averaged 35dwt. The mine is
kept in the best w’orking trim in the hope
that, by raking the four corners of the Com-
monwealth, some decent alluvial parties may
be got. Meantime the Langi South pay-
sheet mounts up. What with cash put to
credit when the co. was floated by Peacock’s
office, and £21,000 of gold won to date and
£93.000 paid in calls, the co. needs good
workers, cheap costs and a big average grade
to replace what has been dragged from share-
holders’ pockets, to say nothing of the little
bit of interest that is usually also looked for.
During the past 12 months, out of the
Constellation mine Bendigo Amalgamated
has stoped 12.93 G tons which have yielded
14 5710 z., or an average of 90s. per ton.
The best stone occurs in the upper por-
tion of the west leg of the saddle, and in
the turnover of the reef. It is richest in
the northern workings at 022 ft., where
Moline is pushing ahead to get more stopes
going. As he has 830 ft. untouched to the
crosscut on the same formation at 568 ft.
off the Northern mine shaft, there is plenty
of room for profitable work, especially if
the east leg comes into bearing with better
gold. Even in the 600 ft. of the reef opened
up the blocks intact between the two ex-
treme workings will give as much stone as
has been broken already, though its grade
may not be so high.

Y-Water, Emmaville (N.S.W.), still
stands midway between the grip of the bank
and the narrow run of rubbly tin-wash into
which it has been plugging for so long. But
as it can show £17,175 of tin in stock or
in transit against the bank overdraft, Chair-
man Wharton may consider the co. has
hobbled out of the mud. Still, £2281 was
all the profit the co. could make during the
past half, though tin hovered well above the
£250 mark—a ballooning figure compared
with the prices ruling when the co. was a
regular dividend payer. The trouble is not
so much the high price of stores or droughty
conditions as the inability in a narrow work-
ing place to put through a big yardage.
Altogether 295,800 cub. yds. were treated,
giving an average of .9831 b. per yd. Since the
co. got to work it has handled over 51 million
cub. yds. for 26031 tons black tin, giving
an average of 1.1051 b. per cub. yd. Manager
Wilson reckons that even should the drought
not break water will not give out before he
gets his dredge on the easier ground ahead.
So far the directors have not verified the
whisper that somebody is on the co.’s door-
step with the offer of an Asian tin show.

It is nearly three years since B. H. Block
10 linked its Papuan gold interests with
four other shows in the Block 10 Misima,
with a capital of £150,000 in £1 shares
fully-paid. But manager Reg Williamson,
who followed the late O. B. Ward, has not
yet been able to ship any profits to the co.’s
Melbourne office. Two years ago the direc-
tors remarked that “as usual with the instal-
lation of new plant” extraction difficulties
were being experienced ; and 12 months ago
they came to the conclusion that if profits
were going to show up at all the capacity
of the plant would have to be increased con-
siderably. As funds had been drained capi-
tal was increased by ss. per share and called
up. Shipping and other difficulties delayed
the plant additions, and not till early this
month had the necessary gear reached the
mine. During the six months to June the
co. treated very little more than the manager
hopes to handle in a month with his new
plant. Also, since nearly half of the 5582
tons sent to the mill came from development
work, the return of 20s. 6d. does not repre-
sent the average value of ore available. Wil-
liamson’s last estimate was 130,775 tons
worth 325. 3d., but considerable additions
have been made to reserves since, while
values are improving with depth, “probably
due to leaching action.” Further, William-
son reckons that “this enrichment will con-
tinue to greater depth.” Costs for the half-
year were very stiff; including 13s. 2.59 d
for development, they averaged 375. 9.62 d.
for the 5582 tons put through. The result
was a working loss of £3754, making, with
Melbourne exes., a net loss of £4379 for the
and swelling the P. and L. debit
to ±15,667. Four months ago the shares were
increased to 305., giving the management a
further calling power of ss. on the 150,000
shares. It is now a matter of waiting
patiently for the enlarged plant to talk.
Meantime the tramline to the coast is being
proceeded with, though that is apparently a
more costly job than anticipated. The story
goes that, after strenuous efforts, the co.
failed to secure permission to push its line
through private property and that it has
had to make a wide detour, calling for
several thousands further outlay. Surely
there was a cheaper way out of the diffi-
culty?

A tentative agreement has been entered
into between the Read-Roseberv Co. and the
Speck Government, the latter to supply the
co. with 15.000 h.p. of electricity at Zeehan
from Lake Rollaston, 12 miles from the town
The Government is also to supply further
power for any requirement. The co. has to
find £750,000 as its share of the cost. News
of the agreement caused great excitement at
Zeehan. where it is considered the scheme
will revive the town quicker than the proposed
King River proposition and equally as well.

ing 2ft. of fair-grade milling ore. The

about 400 ft. to get under the prill ore show-
ing in No. 4 level, where big things are
anticipated by the concern’s backers.

“Camelero”: The Australians and Maori-
landers in the Camel Corps could outlast
the best Arabs when handling the stinking
ship of the desert. While we were stationed
at Mersa Matruh, we were sent out on a
14-days’ patrol. After we had been on the
track for seven days the Arabs with us began
to knock-up, and it was only by threatening
to leave them behind to be killed by the
Senussi that we kept them going. When
AUSTRALIA'S NATIONAL ANTHEM.
we returned to our starting-point three of
the Arabs had to be sent to hospital. The
Anzacs were no worse for the trip. A Welsh
general at El Daaba gave the Cameliers a
great reception as they returned through
the village. He reckoned that the 14 days’
patrol in unknown country with little water
and tinned meat was a wonderful perform-
ance. The blushing Cameliers suggested that
it was up to him to allow them the freedom
of his unit’s wet canteen. lie was a good
sort, and we drank the shop pretty well
dry before the morning.
The petty criminal is a resourceless
creature with no instinct of adventure _or
exploration. When he makes a daring
escape or when he knows he is badly wanted
he takes to a hiding place under a bed in
the next street, and the ’tecs naturally look
for him there. He is not only incapable of
taking to the bush or going on a long-
voyage ; some invisible chain prevents him
taking a really long tram-ride. Six long-
sentence men lately made a remarkable
escape out of a Melbourne prison-van, but
though they had every reason to keep moving
till they got to Queensland or W.A., they
were all found within gunshot of the old
threepenny pub. The last one was takeu
quite tamely in a train-ear. Recognising
that a ’tec in the car had his eye on him he
exchanged signals in passing—possibly a
warning—with a man standing at the door
of an old-clo’ shop. Naturally, after he was
gathered in the force drifted leisurely back
to the clo’ shop, where it found £3OO worth
of stolen goods which might otherwise have
passed unnoticed. This sort of criminal
class is a disgrace to an intelligent com-
munity and is more foolish than a Hun spy
in a novel.
“Hambone” : He was a fire-eating Tommy
majah who put his battery in a gully near
our possy at Mericourt last year. His lament
was that he did not command a unit of
slouch hats, and he continually praised
our ways with Fritz. Bluey discovered that
he had a bonzer trench-coat, and when the
majah came to taste the latest Scotch dew
in our officers’ mess one day, Blue.v went
prospecting, and found that coat. On dis-
covering the loss, our neighbor immediately
stampeded in our direction. “You bally Aus-
tralians !” he said by way of greeting. “You
are the ruination of the army. The only
thing you can do is fight!"
"Ex-O.C. Troops”: Ships’ officers are get-
ting to know the Digger better. In the
first days after the Armistice, when the
early drafts were sent home to Anssie, har-
ried skippers were in the habit of saying
that they had ferried Tommies, Sammies
and all other kinds of troops to the war,
and their behavior was just splendid com •
pared with that of these boisterous home-
coming Diggers. They didn’t realise that it
was one thing to take men to the war and
another to bring them home after they had
done their job. They do now—or some of
them do. When the Bahia Castillo lately
arrived with 1000 or so munition-workers,
nearly all of them Pommies, one of the ship’s
officers said : “Look at the size of the ship
—a transport big enough for 2500 soldiers !
If toe only had had Diggers aboard we would
have been a happy family!" The Digger
had a pleasant and delightfully character-
istic habit of counting in somebody who had
been counted out on a first acquaintance.
They counted out “Teddy Woodbine” and
counted him in when they knew him better;
and they did it to their bands scores of
times. These ships’ officers might go
through the same interesting performance.
* * # *
“Ivaree” : The English colonel (so we were
told on arrival at the 0.T.C.) was nuts on
pedigrees, etc., and
usually asked aspiring
“temporary” gentle-
men the occupation of
their progenitors.
Naturally the Aussie
agreed to pull his
gouty old leg by un-
animously confiding to
him: “My father is a
peanut merchant, my
mother takes in wash-
ing, and” (in a
whisper) “my sister
has gone to the dogs.”
The first man did not
startle old Blazeaway,
as he expected any-
thing from a wild Aus-
tralian. But the third
Aussie had only got to
“M y father is a
pea. ...” when the old
bird exploded. “I
know all about your
family record, sir. You
Australians are all under arrest till returned
to your units.”
There probably never was a more thought-
ful collection of geniuses than those who,
though they had never handled wheat be-
fore. confidently took the control of the
N. S. Wales farmer’s 11.115 crop out of his
hands. The mice plague swept down when
the office was still learning whether wheat
grew in pods or underground, and it was
discovered that the wretched little beasts
were chewing up the bags to make nests
with. The office put towels round its head
and thought for a few weeks. Then it de-
cided that, as mice plainly must have some-
thing to build their nests with, the best
trick to play was to provide them with some-
thing else besides bags. So a large quan-
tity of paper was bought and laid down in
and about the stacks. Unfortunately the
Board forgot to notify the mice that it would
be obliged if they would use the paper and
not the bags, so the old disaster continued.
This is one of the things the farmer is now
paying for.
“The Oldest Inhabitant” makes a fine
haul of ancient Sydney pubs:—
Thirty-five feet to Bridge-street, with a run
through to Dalley-street, has been secured by the
Huddart-Parker shipping people for £21,000. The
premises are now occupied by the South British
Insurance Co., which intends erecting new premises
on the lot west, lately vacated by Burns, Philp and
Co. In the 'forties William Walker opened an inn
here which he named the Dolphin. Later It was

the Bengal. So good was trade that an opposition
pub was started next door east; a narrow passage
between the two gave access to Queen’s-place, now
Dalley-istreet. This passage-way was left in con-
sequence of the waters of Sydney Cove then washing
the eastern end of Queen’s-place. The new pub was the
Thistle, later the Mercantile, and Ned Trickett, the
champion sculler, was in it in later years. West of
the Dolphin in the ’fifties was Barron Cohen, a bullion
broker, who converted his premises into still another
pub, known as the Sir John Franklin. And yet
another pub a few doors from Barron Cohen was the
St. John’s, run by Charles Bath, and that was the
longest-lived of the lot. In the mid-’fifties, one
door from Pitt-street, John Smith called his place
the Help Me Through the World. Bridge-street 65
years ago was certainly not “dry.” In the mid-
’thirties, about the site of the Dolphin Inn, G. W.
Evans (who surveyed the Western-road as far as
Bathurst, and later explored the Lachlan, which,
with the Macquarie, he named after the Governor
who sent him on the journey) had a book-store,
where he sold maps. A little, later, close by, was
Arthur Cubitt, news agent, who discovered the Tich-
borne claimant, and floated bonds for the exes.

“Blanc” : Shortly after the Fourth of July
stunt at Hamel, a Yank who had hopped
over with us called on some of his Digger
friends for a yarn. “I guess we’ll be called
shark troops after this, like you chaps,” he
remarked. Thinking he was talking of their
passion for collecting souvenirs from Fritzes,
a Digger hauled out a watch. Iron Cross, set
of buttons and bundle of German notes, and
“guessed” not many Yanks could beat that.
“I don’t mean that: I said we’ll be called
‘shark troops,’ like you chaps.” Seeing his
hearers didn’t compree, he twanged. “Shark
troops —s-h-o-c-k —shark !”
“Fitz”: The Digger’s contempt for the
Defence Department reaches sublime heights
when he speaks of the “thirty-bobber”—the
civvy suit issued to him on his discharge
from the forces. In a suburban pub the
other evening two Anzacs renewed acquaint-
ance. “See you’re wearing your thirty-
bobber,” said one, putting down his empty
glass. “Yes,” replied the cobber philoso-
phicallv. “It's good enough for drinking beer
in.”
“Centurion”: “1921” lets his zeal out-run
lrs grasp of facts in his estimate of General
Cbauvel (B. 9/10/T9). Ohauvel had
attained his high command and had exer-
cised it with brilliant results long before
Allenby ever thought of leaving France.
Thus “1921” might just as well call Ghauvei
a “satellite” of Birdwood’s on the Peninsula,
or of Murray’s in the Sinai campaign whicn
paved the way to the conquest of Palestine.
In that campaign Chauvel undertook and cuo
things with his Light Horsemen that had
been hitherto considered impossible by
French and British experts in desert war-
dare. As to saluting and all that, Ghauvei,
who is a “regular” of long standing, was
certainly faddy. But then, he is faddy about
religious matters and many other things
which don’t seem to have spoilt him as a
captain of horse.

“Kopai” : The recital, for piano only, was
very high-class—so high that to have an-
nounced the items on the programme as they
were given would have been too philistine for
words. Everyone
was supposed, be-
ing musical, to
recognise the
numbers as they

audience listened
with grim deter-
mination, co m-
menting intelli-
gently and ap-
plauding at the
right places- —

the Death Song

over the hall. The

again and again
in acknowledg-
ment of the tri-
bute, albeit his
face wore a queer expression. Then he sat
down and began to play the Death Song.
An extra had been interpolated in the pro-
gramme ; and the faithful, counting items
on their programme, had wasted their tears
on Liszt’s “Campanella.”

“Taminiek” : “Centurion’s” religion at sea
(B. 16/10/’l9) refreshes my memory of an
old skipper I sailed under who used to corral
the ship’s company for “Holy Joe” —the then
sea-term for Divine service. I was one of
the four backsliders who preferred euchre.
One Sabbath the Old Man inquired why we
were absent. Iteplied Frank Maine, of Bos-
ton (U.S.A.) : “Waal, it’s like this. You
pray for Queen Victoria but never a word
about , our President.” The Old Man pro-

“E.D.”: A family disputation broke out
in a front garden in Port Melbourne the
other Saturday afternoon. The front garden
was about eight by ten, and as one disputant
used a shovel-handle and the other a hard-
wood picket the damage was substantial. A
small boy of the elan sustained a broken
eyebrow, two windows were smashed, and
the man next door, who intervened in the
interests of law and order, lost some teeth.
-Meanwhile the language flowed in torrents,
and the lady of the house leaned on the
front fence and wept desolately. Two or
three ladies from adjoining mansions stole
up, and looked on the battle in a disinter-
ested way, recognising, apparently, that such
outcrops of emotion may be expected in the
best-regulated families. One approached the
woman of the house near where I stood by
my bike, waiting for death or cripplement to
terminate _ the feud, and offered consolation.
The weeping woman wiped her eyes on her
apron. “Oh, dear, dear a-me,” she sobbed,
’when one’s away the other’s as good a
usban’ as woman could wish to have; but
it’s always like this when they’re both out
of gaol together.”
“Phthisis”: “Ranger” (B. 16/10/’l9)
seems to have misread me. It is precisely
because consumptives have souls that I want
some place provided where they can escape
from the soul-atrophying environment of
the public sanatorium. If compulsory segre-
gation in a farm colony is “cruel and hate-
ini, what is to be said of the present seg-
legation in an institution full of hopeless
arid chronic cases, which is at present com-
pulsory on all T.B.’s not of inde-
pendent means? In a colony where
all sufferers were catered for, not
only farming but many other occu-
pations and professions would be
followed, and the place would de-
velop all the amenities of a large
country town. I am a consump-
tive myself, and would prefer, even
if of independent means, to live in a
“colony” with all classes than to
be the pariah I am. Such is the
fear of infection that has been
inculcated in an ignorant public
that I find people crossing the road
if they see me coming. A while
ago I knocked at a neighbor’s door.
A lady opened it. When she saw'
me she ran for her life down the
hall and spoke to me from a dis-
tance of ten yards or so. If I
meet a male friend it is ten to one
he immediately fills his pipe and
puffs away at it in the belief that
he is warding off infection. If I
take a home with my wife and
kiddy, not only do some of my
wife’s friends cease to visit her,
but they also refrain from asking
her to their homes. Others assume
that my child is also tubercular, and
act accordingly. Now, in a colony
where every family had the T.B.
brand on it, this kind of thing
couldn't happen. Give a T.B. a
chance to earn his living within his
limitations and live with his family in
hygienic surroundings, and you have the
nearest approach to a cure that has so far
been discovered.
* * * •»
“Munga Munga” : The censure of Allenbv
was long overdue, though the plain Bill
jims gave him a curt reminder of his lop-
sided justice a few weeks after his memor-
able branding of them as murderers. Hur-
riedly brought down from Syria to help
quell the native revolt, a Light Horse regi-
ment was sent to a hostile district south
from Cairo. With the regiment was an
Imperial political officer to advise as to
whatever action was required. Following
the advice of the p. 0., the regiment was
ordered to fire a volley at a large number
of natives who were wrecking the railway
line; but the Australians fired over the
natives’ heads. The same thing happened
with the next two volleys ordered. There
was an immediate investigation, and the
political officer, quite convinced that the
Australians were in sympathy with the
natives, sat up all night thinking. A search-
ing inquiry was made, but nothing more
could be elicited from the Billjims than the
simple comment: “We’re not going to be
the murderers all the time.” It was the
only statement forthcoming, and had to go
in with the report to the G.O.C. troops.
Unce the report had been despatched the
Diggers joyfully commenced oiling and clean-
ing up their rifles in anticipation of the
coming official war against the Arabs, who
tor years had been sniping and killing off
small bodies of detached troops under the
protecting arm of the no-reprisals policy.
Dad felt differently after the Crimean
war. A. T. Saunders, the Adelaide anti-
quarian, has dug up a memo of the local
peace celebration in 1856. Cheers and a 21
gun salute were given in turn to the
British flag and those of each ally.
Then the late enemy flag of Russia
was run up, and exactly the same
honors were given to that! Governor
Mac Donnell said, as he called for the
cheering: “We cannot forget the gen-
erosity and kindness shown by the
Russians to our wounded and our prisoners.”

Justice Cussen, as a Royal Commission,
found that no improper influence was used
by Aikman, M.L.C., or anybody else with
Arthur Robinson. Vic. Solicitor-General, to
withdraw charges of fraud and forgery
against John Blacker, ex-president of Mor-
nington Shire. Blacker pleaded guilty of
larceny as a bailee of charity money and
was fined, and Hogan, M.L.A., charged the
Law Department with having permitted
political, Masonic and social influence to
deflect the course of justice. It was
admitted that Aikman saw Robinson and
Anderson, permanent head of the Depart-
ment, but it was denied that anything he
said had influenced them. Robinson and
Anderson were exonerated, and that is prob-
ablv all right. But in future they will think
twice before they listen to anybody, frilled
or unfrilled, who calls to whisper about a
case proposed to be placed before the courts.
And especially if he happens to be a
politician.

“Gouger”: The Digger in trouble was not
always without a friend. The O.C. of our
regiment was a solicitor in civil life, and a
devoted father to the hard cases of the
family when they were in trouble, which,
BEHIND THE TIMES.
NELL : “Thank Heaven she’s got decent
clothes at last.”
BELL: "Yes — she’s frightfully old-fashioned.”
as a rule, was every pay-day. When the
regiment was stationed at Bir-el-Deuidar,
the so-called “48 hours’ leave” was initiated.
At that time Tommy M.P.’s were swarming
in Port Said, and they lost no time in run-
ning in the leave men almost as soon as
they hit the disreputable city. The Tommy
Provost sent in such lurid reports about the
behavior of the Aussies that at last G.H.Q.
threatened to stop leave altogether. Then
our O.G. took a hand. He refused to con-
vict his men on the written evidence of
police many miles away, and somehow
managed it that the M.P.’s and the wit-
nesses had to come to Bir-el-Deuidar to
give evidence. This meant a train trip to
FEMININE LOGIC.
MAVIS: “Hers was such a silly
excuse for marrying.”
IRENE: “Well, anyhow, it teas better than
having a sensible reason for staying single.”
Ivantara, then a 12-mile ride across the
desert to the regiment. Most of the M.P.’s
had never been in a saddle in their lives.
Of course we picked out the quietest horses
for them. The first trip these policemen
had they gave us such a*n exhibition that
we almost forgave them the errand on which
they had come. M.P.’s were littered all
over the desert. After that they generally
preferred to walk. When they got to the
camp disillusionment No. 2 was with them.
They were faced by an O.C. who knew every
trick of the law. Faked charges, which
went down so easily with their own Provost,
were in a few minutes pulled to pieces, and
M.P.’s and their witnesses were soon floun-
dering. Result: No convictions, and the
dreary trip back to Port Said again. The
boys were so embittered against the M.P.’s
that we all went to the further end of the
oasis, intending to say a few words to them.
But the O.C. got a whisper at the last
moment, and he came down on us like a
school of pyramids. And of course we knew
he was right. I trod the mat before him
once, and when it was over I felt the .sand
burning through my boots and melting my
spinal-cord. That talk had more effect in
keeping me on the narrow regimental path
than three months’ pack drill would have
done.

“H.T.” : A Wellington John Hop tried to
induce a drunken wharfie, as burly as him-
self. to go along home quietly; but the
beery one wouldn’t take advice, and be-
came nasty. A brief scuffle followed, and
John, with a lightning twist, landed his
quarry fair on the broad of his back with
the neatest throw I’ve seen. When the
pair rose the vanquished wharfie looked his
captor square in the eye. “By G—!” he
panted, “if my old woman saw you do
that to me she’d break your blanky neck !”

“Jake B.’’: In an article on the control
of aviation (B. 9/10/T9) Major Brearley,
of W.A., is reported to have performed,
among other stunts, a “tail slide.” I’ve seen
exhibitions of flying by the late Captains
Collett and Armstrong, who were recognised
as the best stunt-merchants of their day;
also, I have attended an instructors’ course
at Gosport, the home of stunting in England ;
yet it wasn’t until I had returned to Aus-
tralia that I saw or heard any serious refer-
ence to a “tail slide.” Is it the peculiar
quality of the Australian atmosphere—the
flier’s paradise—that makes this feat pos-
sible? In any case, I’m anxious to know
how it is clone, for. in the event of a machine
catching fire in the air, a tail slide would
afford the safest means of descent, as the
flames would be blown away from the ’planes
and the pilot’s seat.

Some of the 41 members of the Federal
Parliament who have signed a petition in
favor of hastening to Canberra, but are
shivering at the thought that the Government
may really shift them there, are cursing the
big dust-storm that spoilt Albury’s chances.
When the hunt for a site was on Albury
was in the running, and Oom Bill Lyne, in
whose electorate it was, gave it a gentle
push. But when the members went up to
inspect it they met a regular snorter of a
north wind, with more dust than they could
eat, about the worst day Albury ever had.
Whereupon that district fell clean out of the
betting market.
“Skipper”: Pozieres was ours, and after
three days and nights of continuous fighting
I’d just stretched out in an old German dug-
out, when Marmaduke brought him in. He
was a captain of the Prussian Guards, his
arrogance undiminished by three days spent
in a shell-hole in No Man’s Land. He re-
fused to believe my Tommy tunic covered a
commission, and demanded to be paraded to
an officer at once. Cigarettes and a tot of
r u m soothed
him a little, and
I probed to get.

the escort was
ready to take
him to the
“cage,” I asked
for Ilia belt as
a souvenir. He
refused it with
great hauteur.

again, I was
just dozing off, Avhen something struck
me smartly on the leg. and —“There’s that
belt, skipper!” bawled Marmaduke from the
darkness of the trench above.

“Mayne Stay” : Re retrospective increases
of wages (B. 23/10/T9). I should like
to know how the Arbitration Court arrives
at its variegated decisions. I hate to think
that Direct Action influences it, but I must
believe my eyes. The Merchant Service
Guild waited 18 months for the Court the
last time it applied, and was complimented
by Justice Higgins on its patience in giving
way to the Broken Hill miners on strike.
Then we were told that retrospective wages
were impossible, though the ship-owners fully
expected to pay. I personally conduct a
fair-sized ark round the coast, and hold a
variety of certificates that take some get-
ting, as well as pilotage exemptions for
some 20 ports. I am continually having my
responsibilities impressed upon me. (Only
the other day the Queensland Marine Board
warned us, in the papers, that if we’re not
SHORTENED.
“What price the dresses? A hit over the
odds some of them, eh?”
"Well, it does look as if they’ve been through
the totalisator.”
careful said certificates will be suspended. )
Yet a wharf-laborer working eight hours a
day gets as much as I do! And I haven’t
any doubt whatever that it would be easier
for the wharf-laborer to get a retrospective
increase than it would be for me to do it.
“I Say”: Re the statement (B. 16/10/T9)
that in the military hospitals “there isn't an
experienced Army nurse who doesn’t know
that scores of the patients are lead-swingers
and are able to dodge discharge.” Yes, and the
lead-swinging may continue even after dis-
charge. Anyway, on information received,
a raid was lately made on a convalescent
ward, the story being that patients after
discharge turned up as usual to sleep, and
had a substantial breakfast in the morning
before imshi-ing. But there were no birds

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The tookmakers are complaining that in point
fact the drapers have left very little for them.”
The draper man, observers say,
Has got the bookie quite outdone;
The public’s money runs his way,
And when the last half-crown is spun
Into the till for costly gear
To put upon the ladies dear,
It follows as a thing of course
Nought’s left for putting on a horse.
With gowns at thirty guineas each,
And hats cheap at eleven quid,
You cannot dress your little peach
And back your fancy as you did.
While mercery’s at its present price
The common man is thinking twice ;
To put his shirt upon a horse
Means going bare-backed to the course.
Out on the lawn the sport inert
Points out his dame in garments gay,
And tells his friend : “There goes the cert
That’s carrying my stuff to-day.”
He sadly spouts the usual gags—
“ Old man, I’m simply done to rags.
In fact, I have no hope this Spring
Of pulling off a single thing !”

“A.X.”: Chaplain-Major Thomas King,
one time of St. Mary’s, Sydney, has just
been appointed Domestic Prelate to the Pope.
King left Sydney for the other side in
November. 1915. on the Persic. The inevit-
able ship’s newspaper appeared, and The
Bulletin worked with the Church in the
production (two Bulletin men and Father
King were the staff of the rag). King went
to France with a sth Div. Battalion, and
while the shocking muddle at Fromelles on
July 19, 1916. was being untangled, spent
all his time in and around the front line,
a very unhealthy spot, and looked like get-
ting into trouble from the staff for not keep-
ing further away. Later he was transferred
to Horseferry-road as senior R.C. padre,
and scored a majority and an 0.8. E. Ilis
last appeal to me in England was “For the
good of my soul send me a Bully now and
then. Some cow pinches mine in the post.
I'm chancing it and addressing one c/o the
Pope, Rome.
Queensland has lost its Wullie Kidston,
the canny politician who saw what was com-
ing and got out into the comparative com-
fort of the Land Court a few years ago. He
was the first Labor Treasurer in Australia.
Then Labor quarrelled with him, as in
Queensland it has quarrelled with almost
every other man who does a little thinking
for himself, and of late the Nationalists
badly wanted to lure him back to politics.
But he was approaching 70, and sick, and
he easily resisted the temptation.
The man whose name was given to Court-
ney’s Post, on Gallipoli, was buried in Mel-
bourne last week. A lawyer in civil life, he
had for 30 years taken an interest in soldier-
ing, and not long before Wilhelm started
arguing “Dick” Courtney crossed over to
Sydney to take a course of military lectures
at Sydney Uni. Having no wife to think
about he was away to Egypt with the first
lot and then on to Gallipoli. The Bulletin
told a story of a colonel who, when he
counted up all that was left of a little lot
who had been sent to do the impossible, was
human enough to bury his face in his hands
and sob. That was Courtney. On his
return to Australia he was given the job of
State Commandant in Westralift; but he
was a sick man, and he disliked it, anyway,
so he returned to Melbourne, to nurse a
heart that refused to get back to its old
beat.
No Australian mine-manager was ever
such an autocrat hs just-dead H. W. F.
Kayser was during all the years he handled
the Bischoff at Waratah (Tas.). The pub-
lic opinion of the township was Kayser’s,
and woe betide anyone who dared to openly
express a contrary one. .Brought up in
Germany, where .the rule of the geboren
over the “common herd” Was absolute, he
governed with a despotism that at the
present time would be impossible. A party
of men on their way to seek work at
the mine met him some distance from the
show, and asked him where the Bischoff was.
Drawing himself up and pointing to his
chest, he replied, “1 am de Bischoff.” As
the uncrowned Wilhelm he presided at all
entertainments, and the scene at a show
given by some wandering artists is still re-
membered with glee by old hands. At that
time there was a popular song, “Kayser, do
you want to buy a dog?” One of the per-
formers commenced the ditty, to the horror
of the audience. The Kaiser sat petrified
through one verse, then bounced out of his
chair and demanded to be told the meaning
of this outrage; after which his offended
majesty called up his numerous family and
marched out of the building. It was not
safe for anyone in Waratah to be seen
smiling for a long time after that.
The Patersons, of Haberfield (N.S.W.),
probably hold the war record for the Com-
monwealth. Of 10 sons nine enlisted, the
tenth just missing the ’bus. As far as is
known at present 15 families in N. S. Wales
alone sent six sons into the A.1.F., and
there are at least 25 that sent five each.
Darlington Simpson, one-time chairman of
several Westralian gold-mining cos., includ-
ing the Peak Hill, died in London last
month. It was at Peak Ilill that he ban-
queted pompous ex-Governor Gerard Smith
on gold plates, dishes, etc-, and pro-
vided a gold spittoon for his exclusive use.
Simpson’s more recent activities were con-
fined to the promotion of rubber ventures.
Off the other day, at 74, to help save the
heathen in China. John Macfarlane, who
landed in Hobart 50 years ago with his
brother, a canoe and a Scotch instinct for
the bawbees tempered with a lot of human
kindness. Long identified with the shipping
of the port, he represented at one time
McMeekin and Blackwood, the first people
to establish regular steamship connection
between Maoriland and the Speck.
As The Bulletin expected, a mere
business man, who has never been even
defeated for Parliament, has been appointed
Agent-General of Tasmania. Alfred Henry
Ashbolt is a Maorilander, born at Christ-
church in 1870. His father was for many
years manager of M.L. Times. Young Ash-
bolt started off by being articled to an
accountant. .He got to Slowbart at 21,
went into a junior bookkeeper’s chair at
A. G. Webster’s, and became chief clerk
in the firm. Nearly 19 years ago he passed
into Jam Jones’s office. To-day he is
a director of the firm, and heavily interested
also in very profitable Malay tin-dredging
shows. His appointment as Agent-General
is a departure from all precedent; but it
ought to be of great advantage to the debt-
burdened Speck, which wants a good busi-
ness agent on the other side far worse than
ever it wanted a tired politician.
Kink O’Malley is to carry the Labor ban-
ner in Denison" (Hobart).
Another good sportsman has died in West-
ralia —11. J. Saunders, M.L.C., an ex-May or
of Perth. He owned and raced horses for
a number of years and kept the turf of a
raw State tolerably clean when it might
very easily have been something else.
Melville Jav. just dead in Adelaide at 63,
was one of that city’s many sporting doc-
tors. For years he was lion, surgeon to the
S.A. Jockey Club, as well as to many
charitable institutions. Latterly he had
taken things quietly, but he had mahy good
tales of the days of Phil Glenister and the
Thompsons. Ilis only son is Dr. Hubert
Jay.
Adelaide’s new fashionable restaurant, the
Rubeo, is staffed and conducted entirely by
returned soldiers. Three Rubeos earned so
much fame at Gallipoli as culinary magicians
that they were always in constant dread of
being shanghaied to the base as chefs to some
hungry panjandrum. Alf Rubeo got back to
Adelaide with four years 219 days’ service,
and his brothers did nearly as well. The
rather remarkable thing is that they didn’t
get a D.S.O. In that respect they were less
(or more) fortunate than the baker at
Rouen.
THE PROFITEER’S ADVICE.
"Now, my boy, remember my success in finance is due to pluck—do you understand?
Pluck, pluck, pluck!"
"Yes, I know , father ; but hose am t to know the right people to do it to?”
Speaking at John Grice’s reception to re-
turned Diggers who are also grads or under-
grads, Lawson touched up Vic. University
men for what looks like lack of public spirit
in peace time. Speaker Mackey and Donald
Mackinnon, he said, are the only graduates
in the local. Assembly. Mackinnon never
had to make any sacrifices to attend the
Uni., but Mackey, while working as a comp,
at the temporary Government Printing
Office (almost on the spot where he now
presides as Speaker), got time off to attend
lectures and qualify for the law degrees he
gained.
Frederick Halcomb, just dead in Adelaide
at 83, gave all his life to the official side of
the South Aus. Parliament. He came to
Australia nearly 60 years ago with an
Oxford degree and an idea of making money
in sheep, but the drought of the middle
’sixties put an end to that venture, and he
became Parliamentary librarian, working up
(alongside of Blackmore, another authority
on Parliaments) to all the highest honors to
be had by a resident official in the talk-shop.
He was a recognised authority on all stand-
ing orders and points of procedure, and 24
Governments came and went during his time.
In private life he was an always-willing
coach of University oarsmen.
Passed over, at the reputed age of 74,
but probably older. Charles Lennox Stewart,
from 1903 to 1905 Treasurer and Minister
for Mines under Evans in the Speck.
Stewart started as a farmer, then drifted
into the “Bananaland civil service, next took
up banking and spent many years with the
London in Victoria. Getting tired of that
he crossed to Launceston and entered poli-
tics. He kept his seat for East Launceston
from 1903 until 1909, and then retired into
private life. No holder of the public money-
bags in Tasmania has been more capable of
persuading the other fellow that two and
two make five. He was gifted with a fluent
tongue, a retentive memory and a command
of arithmetic that would put a calculating
machine out of conceit with itself. For some
years prior to his death he was sec. to the
Launceston Benevolent. Society.
The Bulletin long ago compared parson
Paul Joseph, of Adelaide, who enlisted after
his reckless building schemes had got his
church into serious trouble, to a hero or
melodrama. Act 3. this paper silgges e •
At the Church Door; the Clouds a £ hel *
Act 4: A Soldier and a Man. Act 0 to
follow. The last act has since, been played
out, and his captain sends this home . 1
never saw a finer Christian, and I ne\
saw a man die a finer death,’
News by private cable from Mashonaland
of the death from malarial fever of Beg
Boyes a Vic. native and a member of a
well-known St. Kilcla family, again invites
attention to the Australians capacity bn
getting about. Beg Boyes was a profes-
sional soldier at 16, and at 1 1 was a s
geant-major at Queensclift. At c
volunteered to fight the Boer, and went
through the »’African, war, winning his
commission. He was aide-de-camp to Hoad,
and was assured a career as a professional
warrior, but preferred a free leg. He re-
turned to Mashonaland after a run homy
and ever since has been busy pursuing gold
reefs in the depths of Darkest Africa. He
was for years among the old mines of
Solomon up towards the Zambesi, and death
got him at the age of 36. when it Seemed
that at length he had landed on the good
thing for which he had hunted so assidu-
ously.
Lord Astor, who died last week, was the
heir to the mil lions of old John Jacob
Astor, of New York, who built successively
the Astoria, the Knickerbocker and the St.
Regis Hotels. William Astor had for years
been out of sympathy with America, and
in 1899 he became a naturalised Britisher,
to the great annoyance .of the U.S. press.
The new Viscount is undilutedly English,
lie played polo for Oxford, went into the
British army and became an M.P. He
disappointed his ambitious and intensely
Anglophile parent in one respect alone: he
married a little-known widow, when he
might have had a duke’s daughter, and.
worse, the lady was an American !
J. A. Lyons, leader of the Speck’s Labor
Party, resigns his seat in the local Assembly
to scramble for a Federal seat against
Spence and others in Darwin division. Val-
edicting in the State House the other night
Lyons was careful not to say his farewells
too emphatically, for of course he will re-
sume his State seat if unsuccessful in the
Federal tight. Jim Ogden, who was Chief
Sec. in the Earle Government of 1914-10,
steps into Lyons’s place as Opposition leader.
Until the Federal elections are decided the
Speck’s Labor Party will number 12 in a
House of 30—the precise position Labor
occupied in 1909, when Lyons was first
elected. Ogden, by the way, is the only
member of the present Labor Party who has
held his seat continuously since 1906, when
seven was the main, viz., Earle (now Nat.
Senator), Ogden (now leader). Woods (now
having a second try for the Senate), How-
royd (dead), Watkins (present Labor
whip), Long (ex-Senator), and Jensen (ex-
Minister of Customs).
The absentmindedness of Speaker Coney-
beer, of S. Australian Assembly, helped to
pass the Seventh Minister Bill. The debate
was bitter, and when the time came for
Mr. Speaker to announce the third reading
there was electricity in the air. “That this
Bill be read a second time,” announced
Coneybeer. “A third time,” prompted the
clerk, in a stage whisper. “I beg the honor-
able member’s pardon?” inquired Mr.
Speaker blandly, In the shout of laughter
which followed this second lapse, members
recovered their good-humor, and there was
no further opposition.
THE BODY SNATCHERS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
William McMillan and Hugh D. Mclntosh had a
prolonged argument in a Sydney hall last week as
to which of them was president of the local branch
of the British Empire League. /
Bill was a man of knight’s degree:
Hugh was merely an M.L.C.
Bill was a draper (speak it low),
And Hugh an Impresario.
Each was a fervent patriot:
Both had a gift for spouting rot.
Hugh mostly stood for “Might” and “Fight”:
Bill’s line was “Kingship” and “the Right.”
Bill owned the League, without a doubt,
Until Hugh rudely pushed him out.
Observing which the people said :
“The blighter! He has pinched the dead!”
Hugh kept the body, though the moans
Of Bill would have drawn tears from stones.
The corpse itself was nothing loth;
In fact, it disregarded both.
A natural occurrence, for
It had been dead ten year's or more.
But suddenly Hugh heard a Voice;
And so did Bill—they had no choice.
It was the public’s loud dissent
From rampant self-advertisement.
“Out Hugh!” it howled. “And you, Bill, too!
Out of the graveyard, both of you!”

“II.H.”: “My life is an open book” has
been a rather frequent remark with Wi M.
Hughes of late. Parkes said it once, but,
I think, only once. A voice replied: And
I’ve got a leaf out of it. The bank marked
it ‘N.S.F.’ ”
During the Prince of Wales’s visit to
British Columbia, a cable says, the Kam-
loops Indians gave him the name of Cluet
of the Morning Mists.
The name includes his Highness with that ilk
Which comes home daily with the morning milk.
A grim relic of the old Port Arthur days
used to be in possession of the Frerk family
at Carnarvon (Tas.). It was one of the
“punishment books” of the penal settlement,
setting forth the lashes and other little at-
tentions bestowed on those who offended
against the system. No one seems to know
where it is now; it is suspected that an
interested visitor stole it.
Westralia’s most remarkable military
family are the Cunninghams. Sergeant
George Cunningham, who has been police
orderly to Governors since 1891, has six
sons, all of whom served in the war. Two of
them took part in the Boer scrap. Dad was
born in Perth in 1851. His father arrived
in W.A. 80 years ago with a company of
the 51st King’s Own Light Infantry. Mrs.
Cunningham, the mother of the six Diggers,
was also born in W.A., and her mother was
a native of Fremantle.
R. J. McKenzie, Chairman of Committees
in the Speck’s House of Dodery, has had
to give up on account of failing health. His
place has been taken by octogenarian Staf-
ford Bird, who supports the longest beard
in the State, and has done the most jobs.
He has been a clergyman in two sects,
Speaker of the Assembly, farmer, Treasurer,
Minister of Education, fruitgrower. Post-
master-General and sundries; and he has
had the distinction of running against the
youngest Parliamentary candidate Australia
ever saw —Ben Watkins, aged 21.
This is R. Godfrey Rivers, recently of
Bananaland, and some-
time artist in the Cold
Country, where he
studied in the Slade
school of painting and
exhibited at the Royal
Academy. When he
came to Sydney he
portrayed the vice-
regal features of Gov.
Carrington, and
straightway got a job
as supervisor of the
Art Department of
the Technical College,
Brisbane. , When
Queensland rose to the
dignity of a National
Art Gallery Rivers
took charge of it. He
was also president of
the Queensland Art
Society. Then he
wearied of the unquiet
North and moved
South, hungering for
the apple cheeks of his
native land. Finding
a very good substitute
for them in Hobart he
settled there, and is
teaching the young
Tasmanian how to
achieve art without
growing long hair.
F. W. Coneybeer, Speaker of the S. Aus.
Assembly, who was 60 the other day, has
a record unsurpassed by any Australian
M.P. He was in the first plebiscite taken
by the Labor party for the Assembly. He
entered Parliament for the first time in
March, 1893, being returned for East Tor-
rens, and he has represented that district
ever since, usually being returned at the
top of the poll. The colleagues who were
returned with him in 1893 have all disap-
peared from the House. Honest old Ivor
MacGillivray, who lost his seat over con-
scription, was the last to go. How much
Coneybeer owes to his political sagacity and
how much to his ability to sing a comic
song isn’t easy to determine.
Rev. Henry Howard, Methodist preacher
of Adelaide, a notable orator, author of
many books and writer of verses, was asked
the other day what particular literature he
fancied. “Oh, I read anything,” Howard
answered, “but I do like a good detective
yarn.” With whiskers and flowing locks
the Rev. Henry looks like aa Old Testament
figure, and, like those bard-doers, his remarks
are right to the point. When the Conscrip-
tion issue was being argued he was a strong
advocate of compulsory service, and lost a
number of his flock by inferring that a Dig-
ger, with all his lurid language thrown in.
had a much better chance of getting to
Heaven than an eligible who skulked at
home, even if he was a regular church
attendant.
“Camelero”: There were times when Bill-
jim’s yarns about his rich relations back
home were received with unexpected cool-
ness. A Camel Corps sergeant went into
Duran (Palestine) one evening and chum-
med up with several Jewish girls. They
listened to his glowing accounts of the
best land on earth; but after he had told
them that his father owned the largest
orchard in Kalgoorlie one of the girls sur-
prised him by remarking that she didn’t
remember it. He found that the girl was
Doris Ilaufman, and that when her
parents died at Kalgoorlie in 1912 she had
left for Palestine, where her relations re-
sided. Doris was afterwards an oasis for
many a lonely Digger who visited Duran.
When the Federal Convention met in
Adelaide in 1897, and was faced with the
need for a draft to go on with, a little group
of four did most of the bullocking—Barton,
the leader; his friend John Downer, the
Adelaide K.C.; Richard O’Connor, an ex-
perienced draughtsman ; and Alfred Deakin.
When the semi-official group photo, of the
Convention was taken Barton had Deakin
at his right hand and O’Connor at his, left;
and alongside them was John Quick, who,
of them all, had made the deepest study of
Federal Constitutions. The patriarchs were
seated in front, with Charles Kingston, the
president, in the midst of them —J. P.
Abbott, Speaker of the N. S. Wales As-
sembly ; R. C. Baker, president of the S. A.
Council and chairman of the Convention in
committee; Zeal, Adye Doualas, Graham
Berry, George Reid, Nicholas Brown (Tas.),
George Turner, John Forrest—and not one
of the lot is left.
The old town of Penrith (N.S.W.) has
a landmark which has an interesting connec-
tion with early Melbourne. It is a. house of
two floors, in the main thoroughfare, which
in the ’thirties was occupied by Dr. Tho
Black, whose medical practice extended
miles in all directions. His patients w
of all ranks, from John Jamison, of Kege -
ville, to the father of Tom Bent, who was
a worker on the estate. On September l ,
1838, Dr. Black made a business trip to
Sydney. In those days William Jaques was
the auctioneer for the sale of Crown tana ,
and on the date
named he was
holding a sale of
Melbourne town
lots. The doctor
looked in, and be-
fore he knew
what he had done
had bought lot
18, block G, the
south-east corner
of Swanston and
Collins streets, for
£167 4s. After-
wards the Penrith
doctor moved to
Melbourne, be-
came one of the
founders of the
Bank of Victoria,
and was an
enthusiastic sup-
porter of the
Burke and Wills
expedition.
COLIN
TEMPLETON, the
Melbourne finan-
cial man who was

“Gerardy”: The remarks of “1921” (B.
9/10/’l9) are stamped with the seal of truth.
The daily-paper glorification of General
Chauvel deserves the contempt of the majo-
rity of men who served under him. The glory
of Palestine belongs to the small officer, the
toiling non-com. and the hard-driven trooper
—not to the so-called “cavalry leader,” who
posed on horseback, but followed his divi-
sions to battle in a motor-car. The out-
standing character among big men in the
game is Major-General Ryrie. Pike poor
Jack Royston, he is an idol of the Light
Horse. Painstaking and unassuming, Ryrie
always lent a sympathetic ear to the
Digger with a grievance, and worked hard
to reduce the sentences of men in trouble.
He often went miles out of his way to at-
tend field sports meetings and concerts.
Above all. he never persecuted his men with
old-woman speeches concerning discipline.
Probably the cruellest blow he suffered was
when the command of the Australian
Mounted Division was given to an unpopular
English general. The men always wanted
“Plain Bill” Ryrie, true Australian and good
leader.
THE RIVER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
As I rolled in from heaving seas
To see the wealth of Spring again,
Shy sunlight kissed the harbor trees
Whose leavo»» ere starred with drops of rain.
When night had shrouded all the land -
I sought the panting train.
The engine thundered through the dark,
And all things slept, or lifeless seemed.
A wisp of smoke trailed by. A spark
A moment in the blackness gleamed;
And when the sound of mirth had ceased
I dozed, and slept and dreamed.
I woke, and trees in silhouette
Went gliding past the window panes.
The dawn was cold, the earth was wet,
The tanks replenished by the rains.
We panted over drowsy hills
And rocked across the rolling plains.
Brave sunlight recompensed the night,
As laughter dries an infant’s tears.
A jackass voiced the high delight
That echoed back the distant years—
Oh, this w'as home, my Native Land,
The cradle of past hopes and fears!
Then 10, there smote my earnest gaze
The waters of a noble stream.
Long years ago, with mild amaze,
I watched them through the branches gleam—
The river I have strolled beside
Since then in many a day-long dream.
We roared across its bridge of steel
And gazed on waters blazoned bright.
I felt my crowded senses reel,
My heart surge with a wild delight;
But suddenly a hillock rose
And snatched the river from my sight.
My long train thunders to its goal,
And other streams at times I see,
Whose banks are fair, whose waters roll
By lofty oak and redgum-tree.
Such rivers stir the Pilgrim’s soul,
But there is just one stream for me.
Its bridge with dusty traffic hums,
Its waters quench, its shadows cloy
On sloping banks where stately gums
Evoke the magpie’s morning joy—
The river which I first beheld
When I was but a careless boy.

MOTORISTS !
Here’s a Battery that can’t LEAK
The construction of the Eveready Storage Battery comprises many new features
not found in other types. The plates used (in addition to having staggered ribs
with "keystone” locking design and grid, and being made of pure antimony-
lead) are cast with feet on bottoms of plates which rest alternately on tops of the
four bridges in hard rubber jars.
The Eveready Storage Battery is made of the best materials the makers can furnish
assembled by specially trained electrical experts. The handles furnished with these
Batteries are designed to fit the "hold-down” arrangements of any and all types of cars.
A DEFINITE GUARANTEE—Each EVEREADY Storage Battery
is sold with a definite guarantee against ruinous sulphation (leakage),
which means the hottest spark and a minimum of attention.

The Field Telephonist says :
Absolute dependability under adverse circumstances—that
is the summing-up of the EVEREADY SERVICE.
Whenever the utmost m dependability is absolutely es-
sential, the EVEREADY Storage Battery "makes good.”
Whenever used on the battlefield in urgently telephoning the fluctuations of attack
and defencej in the timed firing of mines; in driving the chief-of-staff’s fast car,
in the rigour of the motor transport’s heavy service , in these, and in the kindred
other uses in which Batteries were used—the EVEREADY Battery demonstrated
its absolute dependability under the most exacting demands. Is it any wonder,
then, that the EVEREADY stands pre-eminent to-day.

If that
Crank Case Arm on
your Ford Car broke!
Stop to think a minute on this possible
contingency, for it is a common enough
occurrence for the Crank Case Arm on
%
Fords to >break. When this happens it is.
a very expensive job to get the damage
patched up, probably costing from £3 to
£6 to repair. The Engine must be taken
out, the’ , old arm removed, and a new
on, with a possible delay of
several days—and when you can ill spare
the service of your handy Ford.
The "APCO” ARM eliminates both the
heavy cost of repair and the waste of time
in delay, Ten minutes with a wrench will
make a better job of it than a new factory
arm, and its cost is exceptionally low in pro-
portion to its value.
The "APCO” CRANK CASE ARM is
made.from malleable iron by the largest manu-
facturers of Ford equipment in the world.
It is carefully machined to a perfect fit, and
weighs two pounds. No item has ever been
offered that will do so much for so little
money, and so, in the event of a broken
Crank Case Arm, insist that an "APCO” be
fitted at once. Most every Ford repair man
keeps them in stock,

What Could He Do?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AFTER reading in my Bulletin an
American’s depreciation of the Aus-
tralian short story compared with
the home-grown U.S.A. product, I decided to
investigate. Yesterday I read Spicy Stories,
a magazine marked 20 cents and costing Is.
3d. Then I had a dream.
“I love you,” he said ; “I love you.”
She meant to struggle, but. instead, lay
inert in his arms. She could feel the rise
and fall of his chest. Painfully she tried
to think what had made her surrender.
“It was last night,” he said breathlessly.
“Across that roomful of boring people I
saw you smile. I needed you. I missed
you. Don’t you love me. too? Answer me.”
“My dearest!” she returned between the
lips he pressed so tightly.
“Little girlie,” he said softly, “I have
missed you. For two years I have starved
for your smile. But I couldn’t stay beside
you, dear. You wouldn’t have loved me if
I had. Now, sweetest, now all is over; I
have come back.”
“You were true all the time, love?” she
questioned anxiously.
“My darling!” lie swept her into his
arms, and, burying his eyes in her hair,
jtried to shut out the picture of that other
woman. He was so lonely and she need
never know. Besides, he only went to the
theatre with her twice. The look of trust
in her eyes pained him, unnerved him. His
nature revolted against his deception.
“Darling,” he whispered, “I was false
once. I met an old girl-friend and took her
out.”
“My sweetest!” she answered, and with a
woman’s womanliness understood, and with
a woman’s understanding she gave him a
woman’s forgiveness.
Together they strolled towards the water s
edge. A bright sun shining on the waves
imparted to them a sheen matched only by
the lustre of her hair. He kissed her lips.
“My dearest!” he said.
“My darling!” she answered.
The scrubbery called to them with
Nature’s insistency. Each knew the heart
of the other longed for the shade of the
trees, and, knowing, they looked into each
other’s eyes—and knew,
“My darling!” he whispered.
“Dearest!” she said. <
The sun shone even more brightly. The
waves advanced even further. Here was
sufficient excuse to seek the shelter of the
trees.
“Dearest!” she said.
“Darling!” he answered.
* * * *
A young man swung briskly through the
scrub. He whistled softly as he went. The
world was kind to Bruce Harvey. With
money, good friends and a wife whom he
loved' and trusted above everything, he had
no quarrel with the world. He swung lightly
along, and suddenly burst upon the young
couple. At first, coming from sunlight into
shadow, he failed to see the girl. As he
was about to hail his friend he noticed the
golden head on his shoulder.
“Mv God!” he muttered, and sank behind
a bush. He had not seen his friend for two
vears, but to meet like this! So that was
how matters were!
He dared not move lest they hear him.
But for them, these three, the spot was
quite deserted. Tie had come to spend an
hour with himself and the sea before going
into the city to meet his wife. And now!
The sun went down. He was shaking so
that he could scarcely remain still. He sank
down lower and crouched still, with the im-
mobility that only a shock can produce.
He thought of the appointment he had
made with his wife, and he smiled self-
pityingly. Why had he come here? Why
should such, a thing be allowed to happen .
He had loved his wife when they married.
He had worshipped, adored her. been satu-
rated with the essence of her. She was the
centre and circumference of his existence.
How he had hoped to take part in her
every thought and word! He had realised
the aloneness of every human soul, and had
striven towards comnlete fusion, yearning to
absorb her individuality, her very existence,
as his own. Clutching at the wing of her
exclusive soul, lie had achieved. a union
that was apparently absolute and ideal. And
n °Tlie couple beneath the shrub moved closer
tosrethe?.
“My dearest!” he whispered.
“Mv darling!” she said. , , , .
In an agony of despair Harvey felt his
tautened nerves rebel. If he could only
leave them alone! If he could only screw
un the courage to speak! But he could not.
He must wait and suffer. He told himself
he hated them—hated Dick Nevers; hated
—but what was the use?
“My dearest!” he was saying.
“Mv darling!” she returned.
Bruce felt his whole body quiver as though
crushed ice was packed about his. spine.
Bitterlv he thought of his wife’s appointment
with him. If he had not stopped to fill m
time he would not now be suffering. He had
alwavs accepted his wife’s word.
The couple rose to their feet. He gave
a sigh of relief. They looked in each other s
eyes—eyes which spoke and answered..
' “Dearest!” He rained passionate kisses
on h-er upturned face.
“Darling!” she said breathlessly.
They moved slowly away. Bruce rose to
his feet, and taking a few steps to make
sure they had gone, picked up his clothes from
behind the bush the two had been shelter-
ing under. Nearly blue with cold, he dressed
feverishly, cursing the fate that had brought
Nevers. lately returned, to make love at the
very snot he had thought deserted enough
to bathe in. .
Would his wife believe Ins story when he
told her? She was awaiting him., he knew.
She always kept her appointments.

One of Many Reasons
——Stronger Fabric
THERE are a multitude of reasons for the excellence of Goodyear
Tyres. Every reason is a link of equal strength in the unbreak-
able chain of Goodyear performance.
Take the fabric, for example! Goodyear was never satisfied with the
grade of fabric that could be bought from the fabric mills, but the
manufacturers contended that no better could possibly be produced.
Goodyear was unconvinced—and, to prove the contrary, the usual
Goodyear exhaustive experimentation began. Mills were purchased,
and all the vast Goodyear equipment of present knowledge and
past experience was applied to the solution of the problem.
The result is the production of a fabric STRONGER THAN HAS
EVER BEEN PRODUCED BEFORE. It is not hard to comprehend
just what additional strength means to a tyre.
Now, not only the fabric manufactured by Goodyear, but all fabric
bought from other mills must be made to Goodyear Specification.
That is to say—it must be Goodyear-grade.
Buy your Goodyear Tyres, Heavy Tourist
Tubes and Tyre Saver Accessories from the
Goodyear Service Station. There is one in
your locality.

Profit and loss surplus £47, and apparently
not a • penny provided for depreciation for
the year! The co.’s late veteran managing
director, W. F. Harrington, who had steered
the business safely through all storms for
nearly half a century before he went west a
year ago, would turn in his grave if he
could see those figures. Many things have
gone ill with this pioneer engineering co.
lately. Troubles beyond the control of the
directors upset; some calculations; while for
a time apparently the Board was not what
a well-regulated Board should be. The ex-
ternal influences which have affected the
year’s profits illustrate very well what The
Bulletin has been saying for many years:
that an Australian industry is on uncertain
ground until it can secure practically all its
requirements locally. During the past year
Walkers, Ltd., has had sonie big contracts,
but a lot of material for these jobs had to be
dragged from the other end of the earth,
and owing to “very unsatisfactory delivery
and unexpected high prices;,” capped by
increases in local wages, estimates ivere shat-
tered and some contracts were concluded
at a heavy loss. Added to these troubles the
co.’s. g.m. resigned, and the directors had
considerable difficulty in finding a successor.
Meantime the Board got at loggerheads, and
J. B. Wood, a director of over 10 years’
standing and a son of one of the original
partners in the old proprietary business,
dropped out. At least, he claims he was
“driven out,” and alleges that after Mr.
Harrington’s death there “had been no real
management.” If that was so, the wretched
results from the year’s operations are not
surprising.
With the co.’s new g.m., R, Farquhar,
who had considerable experience in engineer-
ing and shipbuilding before he retired to
the land in Westralia seven years ago, the
directors hope to make a recovery. Under
good management the old concern should
certainly be able to do fairly well; it will
not be for want of patronage if things turn
out badly, for the directors claim that they
have four years’ work ahead. The co. has
just completed 20 locos, for the Transcon-
tinental, is now at work constructing four
5500-ton steamships for the Commonwealth
Government, and has lately secured a con-
tract for 10 locos, for the Queensland rail-
ways. To undertake shipbuilding the co.
has had to instal a lot of new plant and
increase its stocks; and to finance these pur-
chases its bank overdraft has been in-
creased from £15,899 to £64,751 during the
year. This comparison gives further details
of the balance-sheet movements over the 12
months and shows the growth of the enter-
prise during the past 10 years:—
1909. 1918. 1019.
Liabilities . . . . £5,769 £33,890 £SI,S27

depreciation reserve .. 46,427 47,350 71,874

Investments . . . . 52,051 55.927
Cash and book debts .. 20,324 58,316 64,215
Twelve months ago, after payment of the
dividend, there was a surplus of more or
less liquid assets over liabilities of £93,217 ;
but by June 30 last the outlay on new
plant had reduced this liquid surplus to
£66,237. Meantime £24,524 had been added
to fixed assets, included in the balance-sheet
at £100,374, but shown in the table above
less the £28,500 which has been stored
up in a depreciation account. The annual
appropriations to this fund are shown as
written off in the first table. During the
past year no provision whatever seems to
have been made for depreciation, and the
operations over the period may thus have
resulted in a loss instead of the poor little
profit shown. On the other hand, allow-
ances in the past may have fully covered
the depreciation of fixed assets to date; at
any rate, the co.’s auditor volunteers the
information that after an investigation into
book and actual values he was satisfied that
“values were not overstated.” The pub-
lished accounts should provide a little more
information concerning one item. “Invested
funds. £55,927.” Anything might be tied
up in that parcel representing over 45 p.c.
of the paid capital. In the foregoing re-
marks these investments have, with some
hesitation, been treated as more or less
liquid.

A Newcastle coal-manager declares that
under the amended N. S. Wales mining law,
which permits of freehold areas being applied
for by outsiders for coal-mining, the “owner
is practically robbed of his coal, with the
Government as an accessory.” Well, con-
sider the extent of the robbery. A certain
block of 1000 acres is estimated to contain
from 38 to 40 million tons of coal. Allow-
ing, say, 25 p.c. for waste, pillars, etc.,
thfere remain SO million tons. As the law r
stands the owner would be entitled to 4Jr
p.c. of the net profits on the mining of this,
and a conservative estimate fixes his share
of the product at £300,000, spread over 60
years, or £5OOO per year. It is proposed to
amend the law to make the royalty to the
owner 4d. per ton, on which his return
would be £500,000, or over £BOOO a year.
The owners of such areas ought to be
thankful for “jumpers” coming along and
providing them w r ith such handsome in-
comes without any risk or trouble. The
surface rights of the block referred to are
not worth more than ss. per acre per year.
The land has been held for more than half
a century without any attempt being made
to mine it for coal, and the man who now
steps in and proposes to pay the owner at
the rate of £8 per acre . per year for GO
years is dubbed a “robber” !
* * * *
Though Bourke’s Hill, Emmaville
(N.S.W.), averaged £149 15s. per ton for
its concentrates during the six months ended
August 30, operations resulted in a loss of
£586. But that was chiefly due to the ex-
pense incurred in excavating new sites and
shifting plants, though dearer stores and
higher wages helped to hit up costs to a
record 13.557 d. per cub. yd., compared with
12.218 d. in the previous term, and 91d. only
three years ago. During most of the term
the two plants were at work on Preston’s
block, but the No. 1 was later put on the
eastern slopes, where bores have proved
values averaging about 21b., leaving No. 2 to
clean up the lb. stuff remaining on Pres-
ton’s. Altogether 51,850 cub. yds. were
treated for 20| tons concentrates, a bad
fall from the previous term’s 25'i tons from
61.326yd5. A lot of the ground recently
treated was, however, very hard, while the
drought has also interfered with sluicing.
The co.’s position at August 30 was quite
easy ; it owed £BBl and had £2ioB more or
less liquid.

Mitchell’s Creek, Wellington (N.S.W.),
was for many years one of the steadiest
gold producers in the State. It was owned
by Dick, Davies and Dalveen, and it is on
record that its net returns ran from £15,000
to £20,000 a year. Its surface equipment
was a motley makeshift, but on Dick becom-
ing the sole proprietor he installed up-to-
date machinery in every department. Yet.
from that time the mine ceased to main-
tain its reputation. The Dick' people must
have spent £lOO,OOO without getting any
return. The mine and plant were sold
to a Melbourne machinery firm, which made
arrangements with a Sydney co. to leave as
much machinery as was necessary to work
Dick’s reef, on which previously not much
had been done. An extensive cyanide plant
had been installed, there being an enormous
heap of tailings waiting treatment; but
the Sydney co. did not succeed with either
the mine or the cyanide works. The pro-
perty was then acquired by a Victorian
crowd headed by Bendigo Dyason and Dargo
Bromley. This co. paid some dividends, but
latterly there has been no profit, the mine is
closed down, and the plant is again adver-
tised for sale. This is the end unless the
local enthusiasts who have been very per-
sistent' in their wail to the Mines Depart-
ment that it is a shame that “such a valu-
able mine should be left unworked” put up
cash to do the talking. The main north-
and-south reef was worked for a length of
nearly 3500 ft. without a break, and to a
depth of about 700 ft. showed an average
value of about 14dwt. for about 2ft. in
width. At deeper levels the lode became
much larger, but value decreased. Dick’s
reef, which runs east and west over a long
distance, has shown an average value of
over £4 per ton. but nearly £1 of this has
been left in the tailings. It may seem
strange that a reef of such consistently good
value could not be worked at a profit, but
the difficulty is that, besides being small
and “frozen” on to the walls, it lies so flat
that the broken ore will not “run” from
the stopes to the levels, thus necessitating
much “boodling.”

The issue of 45,000 shares by the Gillies
Hydro Electric co. in London probably swal-
lowed a slice of the holding of the Complex
Ores Co. in that pup float. No doubt burley
had to be offered in London, though it was
not so wise (unless unavoidable) to let a fat-
man abroad pocket the whole of the new
profs., as was done by the underwriters.
The cash enabled Gillies to push ahead with
the perfecting of the electric side of his car-
bide plant after disappointing English im-
portations were scrapped. Before the ship-
ping strike he was turning out 100 tons of
carbide per week, at such a figure and of
such a grade that the output was quickly
snapped up ; but since the steamers tied up
he has been short of coke, and this difficulty
has not ended yet. Still the plant is work-
ing well, though the yield is only about half
what it ought to be. The next thing to be
tackled will he Gillies’s electric zinc scheme.
This the Commonwealth did not show milch
enthusiasm about following up, but that will
not worry the owners if it pans out as well
as the carbide experiments.

“Kay-Eydee” : Koumac, on the north-west
coast of New Caledonia, has recently been
visited, so it is said, by a representative of
the Vacuum Oil Co., which has secured some
big areas in the vicinity. For a long time
past, a seepage of oil, declared by U.S. oil
experts to be of high quality, has been indi-
cating possibilities. A Queensland co.
started boring some time ago, but a city
pavement is as likely to hold oil as the site
selected. Two N. S. Wales syndicates, the
Koumac Oil Lands and the Koumac Petro-
leum Oil Concessions, also own some promis-
ing limestone country. A seepage of oil
exists at the south-west end of the island,
near Noumea. A prospecting bore was put
down to seek the source of supply, but as
it was probing in primary rock, needless to
tell the result. American capital is now
being raised to develop New Caledonia oil.

“Pick”: The cockatoos and parrots that
make their nursery apartments in hollow trees in-
variably strip a ring of bark from around the en-
trance spout. The generally-advanced theory is that
a slippery hold is thus afforded the gohanna or other
egg burglars, but observation has convinced me that
the ring is a barrage against ants. I have seen colonies
of them backing from the sticky moisture of the
sappy surface, and the widest stripped area is always,
along the ant runs. The barking is done by the
male bird about the time the family is due to
arrive, and at intervals, until the flying master
takes charge, a fresh section is ringed outside that
previously stripped.
“Silas Snell”: You wouldn’t look for sen-
timent in a magpie, but I have proof that Maggie
is really a most sensitive and sympathetic bird.
Years ago when Frank Clark was running his Silk
Stockings Co. at the old Vic., in Bourke-street, now
a mere billiard-room, a favorite of his galaxy was
Nina Tulloch, a clever Tasmanian lass who relieved
an ordinary serio-comic turn with an original ditty
in which she worked off realistic imitations of the
morning magpie in his native wilds. The then pro-
MISTAKEN IDENTITY.
“I just had some funny experience cornin'
down 'long. I thought I could see Billy
Bilcock goin' up the 'ill, and 'e thought
'twas me cornin' down, and when ice
come for to meet 't wadden neither one
of us."
prietor of the hotel attached to the Vic. had a
pet magpie hung in a cage in his bar. This bird
was always strangely agitated by Nina’s shrill bird-
call, and would listen for her with impatience, flut-
tering excitedly about his cage, and jabbering all
the language he knew. Then when the cry came
from the stage he simply whirled in a sort of
ecstasy, and was not reduced to the normal again for
quite an hour. Nina Tulloch passed on to other
fields, and the magpie in the bar listened in vain,
displaying such perplexity and disappointment that
his almost human emotion made him notorious.
Nearly 12 months passed before Miss Tulloch came
to play a return season at the Vic. At her first
magpie call on the Saturday night the infatuated
bird bounded off his perch, fluttered at the bars, and
fell dead in the bottom of his cage.

“Searchlight”: We were camped for the
night in a paddock near Glen Innes (N.S.AV.). The
situation was on the side of a dry creek, and we
roughly slung the tent on a rope attached to two
trees. We had noticed a mob of Herefords camped
some half-mile up the creek, but didn’t apprehend
any trouble from that source. We had been asleep
about two hours, when a peculiar call attracted my
attention. It was like a squeal, and ended with
a noise like a hammer being bumped on green
timber. I had never heard a similar noise before,
nor have 1 since. Another noise now caught my
ear. It was like distant thunder, and I knew what
had happened. The cattle had been alarmed by
the unfamiliar noise and had stampeded. I yelled
to my mate, and we sought shelter behind the
nearest tree. We were not an instant too soon, for
the maddened beasts rushed headlong down the
ravine, taking small timber and saplings before
them. For a few seconds nothing but horns and
glowing eyes were visible. Crash—crash, and then
silence. About a half-mile down we found portion
of the tent fly. Moral: Never doss below a cattle
camp.

“McNorth”: One Torres Strait island vil-
lage wanted to hold a fancy-dress corrohoree, with
trimmings, in honor of Peace, but was short of
the necessary items. So this letter was built and
forwarded to a Thursday Island pearler:—
We write letter to ask you if you please can
lend wo feller some old divir dress. We want
make big danse, put someting flash on bodys and
paint on paces. Old broking divir dress will do.

“ Jim Carew” : I plump for the woolly-butt
as the best Australian wood for a mallet. I have
used it very extensively, and while I don’t say
it will outlast the one mentioned by “Mulga” (B.
9/10/’l9), I will guarantee it to outlast any of our
hardwoods.

“Van Tromp”: One of the earliest parts
of the Australian coast, possibly the earliest, to be
explored by European navigators is still one of the
least known. This is
the western side of
Cape York Peninsula,
along the Gulf of Car-
pentaria. In 1605 the
Dutch vessel Duyfken,
sailing from Batavia,
ran along this coast,
and later in the same
century it was ex-
plored by Carstens
(1623) and Tasman
(1644). Yet the coun-
try is about the wild-
est and least explored
bit of Australia, and
the natives about the
Staaten River ar e as
nearly in a state of
nature as any in the
continent. Carstens.
who drew a good map
of the coast, but
failed to find Torres
Strait, captured a
blackfellow and took
him to Batavia. A
much more recent
pioneer who poked
into these parts gave
Black Brother a whole-
some disrespect for
the white man with
the help or two plugs
of dynamite. There
were rather too many
visitors to his camp,
so he shoved the plugs
under the bark of a
tree and exploded them
with a couple of bul-
lets. There was a lively explosion; the warrigals
cleared as if the Devil were after them on motor-
skates, and never came back.
* * * »
“Mulga” : The ironwood, or “dead finish,”
tree of Southern and Western Bananaland is a surer
destroyer of axes than the yellow-box mentioned
by “Agricola” (B. 18/9/’l9). While toiling with
a surveyor in the St. George district a few years
back we frequently made the vegetable’s acquaint-
ance, and it’s a marvel that our language didn’t
melt it down. On one occasion, while cutting
the • stock-route line from St. George to the
Balonne, we had to fell an “old man” of the species.
It soon had all our axes useless. Next morning,
rather than tackle the tree again with the blades,
we “drove” an enormous yellow-jacket gum into the
ironwood, and that did the trick. The timber is
absolutely worthless for construction purposes, as
it quickly rots in the ground and is too heavy for
use out of it.
* * * *
“Dormant”: How’s this for a record
charge fired in Kensington Hill (Vic.), about 35
years ago (all Diggers who visited France during
the last five years barred) ? The contractor wanted
to shift part of the landscape in great haste, so a
small tunnel was run into the hill, T-shaped, and
60 kegs of powder introduced. Tommy Cody fired
the charge one evening, and the windows in Mel-
bourne shook like a German on sighting his doom.
TAKING ALL THINGS INTO ACCOUNT.
CUSTOMER : “That's a very small piece of
meat for 3s. 6d!”
BUTCHER : “Oh, no, sir. Not considering the
present price of paper."
“Bright”: “W.H.P.” (B. 18/9/’l9) asks
for a remedy for the small white worms in a horse.
Tell him to starve his moke for about 12 hours and
then with the aid of a drenching-bit give him a
wineglassful of turpentine in a pint of fresh milk.
If the first dose does not have the desired effect
repeat at intervals of about a week.

JOHN HALLAM.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In evil plight John Hallam lay,
With pain and thirst distraught;
Bereft of sense, bereft of strength,
AA r ith demons twain he fought.
No loved one bent above his bed
To soothe his heart and brain,
As all alone, a stricken man,
He fought the demons twain.
He filled the darkness of his room
AVith moan and groan and shout: '
One demon was the heat within,
And one the heat without.
No loved one bent above his bed
To stead him in his strife ;
For months before, red months before,
Dark stars had crossed his life.
The woman whom he loved had fled
Grown weary of her. lot—
Hell’s heat, Hell’s utter loneliness;
And he —he blamed her not!
He watched, he felt, he understood,
And when the parting came
He blamed her not, because his love
AA'as all too big for blame.
For city-born and city-reared
And light of heart and gay,
The desolate, grey, stricken plains
Appalled her, night and day.
That desolation crept and crept,
A weird, pervading thing,
Into her veins, till life grew grey
Beneath its shadowing.
And twice, and thrice, and many times
It seemed her heart would break ;
And, worn and pale, she begged of him
To quit it for her sake.
For noon and night it met her eyes,
Relentless, vast and grim,
Till hate of it at last became
More strong that love of him.
PETERED OUT.
"You used to say there was something about
me that you liked very much."
"Yes; but you've spent it all now."
But sprung from steadfast, Western men
Of pioneering blood,
Nor Love nor Drought could shake his will;
The fight was where he stood.
The ground his father’s hands had won
He swore his own should keep,
Though it should cost him all he loved,
Though Love itself should weep.
And then she fled, and then dim-lit
For him hung star and sun;
The stark, stern plains had rent apart
Two hearts by love made one.
Came sterner drought, and arid winds,
And dust-storms, fierce and dread,
Till care and trouble lay upon
John Hallam’s heart like lead.
But still he fought the demon Drought
With tireless hand and brain,
By night and day till sickness fell,
And made the demons twain.
One demon plagued the stricken plains,
And one his frenzied mind;
And then came phantoms, and he sensed
Strange voices on the wind.
As in the hot, dark, sluggish night
He tossed and turned about,
He heard now near, now far away,
The Voices of the Drought.
By red delirium stressed and surged,
He stilled his sighs and moans,
And heard the creeks, the little creeks,
Give out their dying tones.
From shrunken beds they spoke to him
With sad, regretful note
That told of greedy sand and sun,
And thirsting root and throat.
And then they ceased, and then from far
A whisper seemed to pass
Across the night, and die away—
The sigh of withering grass.
From East and West it came to him,
It came from North and South ;
It told of sapless blade and stem,
And starving beak and mouth.
Then low and strange, and vague and weird.
And faint as faint could be,
He heard the withering of the leaf,
The shrinking of the tree.
And as he lay with tortured ears,
And gasped and gaped for breath,
There came the cry of famished birds
That fluttered to their death.
And then, low moaning through the night,
Fierce fever in his veins,
He heard the cattle on the hills,
The sheep upon the plains.
And over all, most sad of all,
He heard with ’wildered mind
The sighs of broken men who left
Their ruined homes behind.
And yet—how strange, how sweet and strange,
How far and yet how near —
Among the voices rose her voice:
“John Hallam, I am here!”
A phantom voice, a fever voice,
And yet it soothed his brain;
For other wonders filled the night—
The Voices of the Rain.
No more by red delirium scourged,
He stilled his sighs and moans,
And heard the creeks, the little creeks,
Give out their laughing tones.
Like children, blithe and bright and free,
Who lift a laughter-song,
They frolicked down their parent hills,
And danced the leagues along.
And as they leapt o’er log and rock,
And wound by root and reed,
A subtle stirring came to him,
The quickening of the seed.
From East and West it came to him,
It came from North and South;
It seemed to say: “I fill the need
Of hungry beak and mouth.”
And voicing thanks and deep content,
As when green plenty reigns,
He heard the cattle on the hills,
The sheep upon the plains.
The secret under-notes of life
Grown audible to him,
He heard the singing of the sap
In leaf and root and limb.
Sleep came at last —deep, healing sleep—
With wonder in its train,
For something on his forehead lay
As soft as cooling rain.
The phantoms fled, the fever ceased,
Dear Love his dreaming blest,
And, like the brown, rain-sweetened earth,
His body drank in rest.
From slumber, kind and good and calm,
He woke when dawn was near,
And felt her hands upon his brow.
“John Hallam, I am here!”

“LITTLE GIANT” Pumping Outfit!
Strong as a Giant. Ever Reliable. Practical and Economical.
Can you afford to be without it? Hundreds of farm and station owners who
have had the Little Giant in use for the past several years agree on the following:
1. A good reliable Pumping Outfit is essential for successful farming.
2. It is false economy to try to manage without one.
3. The “Little Giant” is the surest and most economical means of ensuring
a plentiful supply of water at any time and anywhere.
H. R. SPENCE, Killmeston, Carroll Gap, writes: —“I find the Little Giant Pump-
ing Plant a great boon, running eight or nine hours on a little over four quarts
of Benzine, which I consider very economical. I also use the engine for wood-
sawing, chaff-cutting, thrashing corn, and sheep-shearing.”
A. J. BRYCE, Minchant, via Jimbour: —“I have given the Little Giant every test,
having pumped water every day since I bought it with eminently satisfactory
results. Having had a good deal of experience with engines and windmills of
various makes, I consider it impossible to beat the Little Giant.”
F. KNOWLES, Esq., Bullawack, Narrabri:—“Three years ago I purchased a
Little Giant outfit and am indeed pleased with it. It watered 930 sheep on dry
feed and scrub on a half-tin of fuel per month. I consider this good work. I
also use engine for cutting hay.”
Don’t Study False Economy! Install the “Little Giant”
and Secure the Service and Satisfaction that Hundreds
of Others Have Obtained from This Popular Outfit,
For the sum of £52/10/- you get a high-grade 2-B.H.P. Water-cooled Engine
(which will supply power for other work when not pumping), a substantial back-
geared all-metal Pump Jack, with white-metal bearings, oilers, etc. A 1 7in. x 2 7in.
heavy metal base for holding both Jack and Engine. Stuffing box, rod and

yet expedient
PERFORATED HONE
solves the question permanently. You will won-
der why it was not thought of before, but it
provides a lifetime of easy shaving for a small

“Black Bonnet”: Rossville (North Q.) is
a paradise of pigeons. The bublo-mary is always
talking in the scrubs, and just now the feeding
trees are white with the Torres Strait pigeons. We
have the bronze pigeon—a handsome friendly fellow
—the big grey-crested, the pink-head, the black
and white baldy and many other varieties. The most
beautiful of all is a little living jewel that nests in
the forests. He has gold head and neck, and his
suit is blue green and rose, an iridescent blending

“Dr. Nil”: In answer to “Leo Lear” (B.
25/9/’l9) re the true meanings of “heifer,” “bullock”
and “steer” (not to mention “ox”), I turn to “Bailey’s
Dictionary” once more (“printed by T. Cox, at the
Lamb, under the Royal Exchange, a.d. 1736”) :
“He'ifer [Heavore —Sax.], a young cow.”
“Bull [Bull, or Bullence —Sax.], a well-known
animal.”
Bullock [Bullence —Sax.], a bull—gelt.”
“Steer [Steor and styr—-Sax.; tiur, Danish; stier,
Dutch ; stehr, German and Teuton; taureau, French ;
taurus, Latin; tauros, Greek —a bull, or, in the
original, a beast that wounds with his horns; all
probably from taro or taru, Celtick to wound or
stab. And here, says the learned German
geographer, Wachter, ends the dispute whether the
Ij. Taurus be derived from the Teut. stiur, or vice
versa], a young ox or heifer.”
Anybody the wiser?
“Cowboy”: Can any obliging Abo. vet.
give me a remedy for distemper in dogs ?
“Werrimee”: The corn-cob pipe used to
be very common among maizegrowers on N. S.
Wales river farms. Another pipe was made from
a cone of the gum-tree, and a neat and pleasant-
smoking “gun” it was. In shearing-sheds the
needlewood pipe is a firm favorite. It is often
beautifully-fashioned. Plenty of men in sheds, huts
and on the track carve these pipes for sale, and
the wood is now used by Australian pipe-manufac-
turers, which explains why it isn’t generally known
locally, although it is one of the best of woods the
smoker could select.
* * * •
“Agar”: The tastes and stomachs of the
discolored races are past the understanding of the
Caucasian. Castor-oil, an abomination to white
people, is swallowed with gusto by the average
South Sea Islander, even children taking it down
like mother's milk. Castor-oil and Epsom salts
are the two white man’s medicines that the natives
have absolute faith in. After one of the ceremonial
feasts that they indulge in on the slightest pretext,
and at which they consume enormous quantities of
turtle, yams, dugong, fowls, fish and bananas, some-
times varied by alligator and snake, they dance
themselves into a state bordering on exhaustion, and
then sleep. Next day, feeling that something has
gone wrong with the works, they make for the
nearest drug-store or white man and demand salts.
Two packets is the usual thing, and these are
washed down with copious draughts of sea-water,
followed by frequent long drinks of the same fluid
during the day. “Me no work along to-day, me

by-um-bye.” The sufferer is all right in 24 hours
and quite ready for another feast. Incidentally
inoculation is common among the colored races of
the world. I have seen it practised among the
natives of New Guinea and Africa, as well as by
our own aborigines.
“Te Babarantiko”: “Moe” (B. 25/9/T9)
has a nerve when he describes the divers of Madang
as of poor quality because they could not be “in-
duced” to go down 60 feet to put a rope around
an old cannon. The divers knew the feat to be
A NEW SELECTION.

impossible. I have heard of natives going down
10 fathoms, but have never seen the claim made
good, although I have had to do with some of the
best divers in the Pacific. Four fathoms is con-
sidered a moderate depth for working, and then
they won’t spend more than from 1-1 to 2 minutes
under. I have had men go six fathoms (36 feet)
deep, and work there for a moment or so; but it
is bad business to overtax a good diver.

“A.W.0.”: If your dog eats eggs here’s
what you do. Set a rabbit-trap and cover it over
with loose earth. Place the egg on the dirt just
above the plate of the trap. When Towser attempts
to take the hen output he will press down the plate
and release the trap, which will grab him by the
nose. He’ll die of starvation before he’ll tackle
another egg.

“Searchlight”: On the Dorrigo (N.S.W.).
during a weather disturbance, a bolt of lightning,
after demolishing a verandah, entered the open
front door of a cottage, ran out through the back,
and then knocked a shed over. The
clock in the dining-room was struck
to a standstill, though nothing else
there seemed to be affected. The
farmer’s wife, who was sewing in
another room, did not know anything
unusual had happened, and was aston-
ished when she saw the state of the
verandah and shed. The works of
the clock were fused into a solid
mass. In another locality a farmer
was much annoyed by the number
of times (17) that a stump near the
house had been struck by lightning.
Thinking that it was attracting the
electricity he cut it down. In the
next storm the chimney of the home-
stead was destroyed. The Coramba-
Dorrigo mail-coach ran into a big
storm some year or two ago. The
horses were both struck dead, but the
driver received merely a slight shock.
I once saw lightning running mad
around a bush post-office. It hit the
telegraph post and took a strip out
of it as if a bead plane had been run
down it. The shock threw the post-
mistress to the ground and sent dust
out of the door in clouds. With
lightning it is the unexpected that
happens. A man riding a horse near
Nevertire during a storm received a
oad shock when his prad fell down dead and he
couldn’t free his feet from the stirrups. The nails
in his boots and the stirrup-irons had been fused
together 1
“Bill’s Brother”; Anyhow, I know one
man who put the zamia palm to practical use. His
method was to collect the dry seeds in barrels con-
taining a quantity of cheap scent and a little red
aniline dye and ship the lot to Colombo, where
tourists would buy them as “the famous Australian
scented palm nut” at Is. each. They sold like cool
drinks in a thirsty land.

“Wart”: Season after season for three
years a pair of mopokes built a nest —if you can
call half a dozen sticks
laid across a fork a nest—
in the peppermint-gum in
my ground alongside the
road. Trams pass, and
there are dozens of kids
going to school within
20ft. of the spot, yet one
bird sat all day on the
two white eggs or yellow
nestlings, giving an imi-
tation of a brokeh-off
branch. The other bird
was always perched
lengthways on a limb
about 30ft. higher in the
same tree. For three
years they succeeded in
rearing families, but the
fourth year the kids found
them and stoned the
youngsters out of the nest.
The cuckoo-shrike, o r
summer-bird, as it is
called in these parts of
Tassy, is usually one of
the shyest things when
nesting. I have several
times known them desert
nests containing eggs
when they had been
looked at, but not
touched. Nevertheless, a
pair of them a couple of
seasons ago reared a
family on a limb that
hangs right, over the tram-line and is alongside a
street-lamp which burns all night.

Kitty Kitty”: Apropos long distance
travelling on horseback. A stockman left Coopla-
curripa station (N.S.W.) at daylight one morning,
rode to Dungog, and returned to the station about
11 o'clock next night. Distance, 190 miles.

“F.J.F.”: Re “Frank R.’s” (B. 25/9/M!))
so-called record fox. On Eunonyhareenyha station,
near Wagga (N.S.W.), some years- ago with one
dog I ran a specimen down that measured Oft.
6in. the longest way. I didn’t think of weighing
him, but as it took his captor, a big deerhound,
five lively minutes to despatch him, he was no
flyweight. That deerhound accounted for 70 foxes
that winter.

“Bright” : To remove an obstruction from
a rifle barrel I prefer to go about it in a much
safer way than any described by Abo. writers
so far. Get a pot of boiling water and pour it
into the barrel from the breech, and keep pouring
until the barrel becomes quite hot. This has the
effect of enlarging the bore, as a rifle barrel swells
with heat. V.'hen it is hot put a drop of oil
in it between the obstruction and the muzzle, and
with the aid of a rod force the obstruction out,
being sure to push it from breech to muzzle. Having
done this, oil the bore, and to make sure that no
superficial fouling remains in it use your pull-
through a couple of times. Then oil up again
and the weapon will be little the worse for "the
mishap.

"Jim Carew”: An exceptionally good
saddle-horse might tire out a poor brumby, but in
fairly equal conditions' the latter will win every
time. I have chased hundreds of brumbies, and
nine times out of ten have missed yarding them.
Whenever we got wind of a decent mob we used"
to post riders at intervals along the route we were
trying to run them, and, after riding hell-for-leather
over our section, we’d turn it in to someone else
and cut across for the final flutter at the “wings.”
By the way, what is the best method of taming
a brumby after you get him? Starving used to
be the most popular way with us, and it was
fairly effective, but very cruel.
“Gouger”: I like a good liar. A little
while back a young new-chum tried to walk from
the Scrub Camp to the Mossman (N.Q.). After his
rescue he told us a little of his adventures. Coming
to a salt-water creek, and being afraid of alligators,
he built a raft, slung aboard his swag, which con-
tained his fortune (nine sovereigns), and set sail.
His faithful dog swam alongside. In the middle
of the creek he was horror-stricken to see a huge
alligator drag the dog under water. Knowing the
’gator would surely come for more, he raked his
brains for a plan of escape. Suddenly he thought
of half a dozen plugs of dynamite and some fuse
and caps which he had in his swag. Unrolling the
swag he tied the six plugs together, inserted a cap
and fuse, rolled up the swag, strapped M-' dvnamite
on to it and waited. Almost immediately ’•ose
the alligator, Its huge jaws wide open, saliva run-
ning from its cruel teeth as it made for the dainty
morsel on the raft. Striking a match, the man held
it to the fuse; then, picking up the swag, he
threw it into the open mouth of the monster. The
swag disappeared and, temporarily satisfied, the
’gator slowly swam beside the raft, his wicked eyes
watching the trembling man. Suddenly there . was
an awful explosion. Alligator, raft and man were
hurled into the air. The last the man remembers
for some hours was hitting the ground with great
violence and something heavy bumping down along-
side of him. On recovering consciousness he saw
that he had been blown back on to the creek-bank
from which he started, and that what was left of
the alligator was lying alongside of him. He
decided to make his way back through the tangled mass
of jungle and mountains that lay between him and
Scrub Camp. For a week he tried, but was always
blocked by a great cliff which fell sheer into the sea,
and was bounded on the landward side by impassable
jungle. Every night for a week he was forced to
return to the alligator, which was the only food
he had. On the evening of the eighth day, to his
horror, he found that he could not find the ’gator.
After wandering about all night he found himself
in the more open country directly behind the cliff.
Suddenly he heard a great bellowing, followed by
the crash of branches. His heart froze in his
throat. A mob of big-horned, wild scrub cattle
were chasing him. The frantic man ran as he had
never run before. A minute later and he was at
the cliff brink with the leading bull at his heels.
He jumped from a height of 500 feet into the sea.
Just before he hit the water something knocked him
unconscious. It was the bull's hoof. On re-
covering he found himself washed up on a little
sandy beach, and beside him was the drowned body
of the bull. Here was food for an almost indefinite
period. (Lie proceeding.)

“W.R.P.”: Strangles (Febris pyogenica)
is a disease of colthood. The chief symptom is a
swelling under the jaw, which increases until the
formation of pus and the pressure within makes a
thin place, when the abscess is said to “point.”
There is often a great amount of constitutional dis-
turbance and high temperature. Treatment consists
in forwarding the pus formation and inducing it to
come to the surface. When a soft place or
prominent one is felt the lancet is to be boldly
plunged into the abscess and the matter liberated.
It is often very thick and there may be
need of some manipulation to get it out.
The introduction of a little turpentine and
olive-oil in equal parts will facilitate the dis-
charge, after which the sore generally heals with
great rapidity if left alone. A tonic of iron and
gentian is very useful to restore the animal’s
strength after the operation, for the disease is very
weakening, and occasionally causes death from rup-
ture of secondary formations into the chest.

A Plain
Fact!
allowed to do what I think is literarily his
job.
In any case, what is the matter with
taking pen, ink and paper, and writing
down the tilings in the mind? It is hard
to write astride of a hobby horse, whether
it be called “the military death penalty,” or
“white slavery,” or “what-not.” It is not a
happy thing to have to count the “prithees!”
and “fair ladies” on each page, with the
sneaking fear that to be atmospherically
true to period the page should be full of
shockingly bad language and distressingly
intimate domesticities. And it must be
damnable for the artist, with the knowledge
of human nature that he must possess, to
make the natural end of the triangular situa-
tion a tragedy of despair, or to frustrate
that natural end by artificial means. He
knows —lie knows he can’t get away with it.
All the parsons in the world can’t make his
critical sense think that literarily he has
got away with it.
Lots of things occur to me that can be
presented with sincerity and simplicity on
paper; but reading my conclusions to this
point, I come to another, viz., that those
set forth here are possibly all wrong. It
may be that a “drunk” of modern novels
is not good food for the alleged critic. It
seems to make the errors and inefficiencies
stand out unduly; and to suppress, equally
unduly, the hard work and the many good
things in the books. Thank God. I am not
a reviewer all the time!
FRANCIS BRIEN.
How Many Hamlets?
“0.K.”: Touching the tradition of a
“Hamlet” play written by Thomas Kyd, and
my remark in another column (“Poverty
Point”) that Malone was an untrust-
worthy authority on the subject. I
am answered by “Harrison O.” (B.
9/10/T9) with further learned asser-
tions by other writers than Malone, to the
effect that Kyd’s play was an undoubted fact.
“H. 0.” scoffs at the notion of dead-and-gone
Malone having been untrustworthy. But Bos-
well, his painstaking contemporary, asserted
that Malone was often inaccurate. Careful
Charles Knight, in later years, also questioned
the truthfulness of the departed scholar’s evi-
dence ; nor does the evidence of even later
witnesses in support prove that Shakspeare
was not the originator of “Hamlet” in
dramatic form. I spoke of Charles Knight
as a Shakspearean authority because he is not
too assertive, and I quote from him here-
with :
There is a general belief that some play under
the title of Hamlet had preceded the Hamlet of
Shakspeare. Probable as this may be, it appears
to us that this belief is sometimes asserted too
authoritatively.... The old play is lost Not a
tittle of distinct evidence exists to show that there
was any other play of Hamlet but that of Shak-
speare ; and all the collateral evidence may be taken
to prove that Shakspeare’s original sketch of Hamlet
was in repute at an earlier period than is commonly
assigned.
“Harrison O.” points out that “Sir Sidney
Lee even suggests that Immortal William
acted in Ivyd’s Hamlet in 1594”; also he
alleges that “a performance of Kyd’s Ham-
let is mentioned by Thomas Lodge in ‘Wits
Miserie,’ published in 1596.” Now, Charles
Knight drew the conclusion that “Kyd’s
Hamlet” was no other than the Bard’s ori
ginal sketch: —
We can find nothing in Malone’s argument to prove
that it was not .Shakspeare’s “Hamlet” which was
acted by Shakspeare’s company on the 9th of June,
1594. In a tract entitled “Wits Miserie,” by Thomas
Lodge, printed in 1596, one of the devils is said to
be “a foul lubber, and looks as pale as the ghost who
cried at the theatre, ‘Hamlet, revenge.’ ” In the first
edition of Malone’s “Chronological Order,” he says:
“If the allusion was to our author’s tragedy, this
passage will ascertain it to have been written in or
before 1596 ; but Lodge may have had the elder play
in his contemplation. In the second edition of this
essay Malone changes his opinion, and says: “Lodge
must have had the elder play in his contemplation.
Leaving our readers to form their own judgment
upon the external evidence as to the date of
Hamlet, we must express our decided opinion,
grounded upon an attentive comparison of the origi-
nal sketch with the perfect play, that the original
sketch was an early production of our poet.”
After which Knight goes into details in sup-
port of his theory. His theory is modest
enough, Heaven knows, in comparison with
some other Shakspearean arguments. Knight
maintains that a sketch of Hamlet, written
by William many years before the produc-
tion of the famous tragedy, was probably
identical with the previous play which tradi-
tion ascribes to one Kyd, whose alleged play,
if it ever existed, is undoubtedly lost. As
for the learned “authorities” who swear by
Kyd, they are not more positive of their own
correctness than the tireless students of
Shakspeare who declare that Bacon wrote
all hia plays.
A Satchel of Books
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, by V. B.
Ibanez, translated by Charlotte Brewster Jordan
(Constable, London). This is a remarkable Spanish
book bearing on the war. The four horsemen are
Famine, War, Plague and Death; and the yarn
tells of the making of a hero out of an effeminate
tango expert. There is plenty of color, good char-
acterisation and some melodrama ; and the descriptions
of the German march on the Marne are excellent.
The Secret Battle, by A. P. Hubert (Methuen,
London). The tale of the struggle between a
romantic and efficient young officer of the British
Army and the old duds of the effete military machine.
There is a quiet power' about the book, and the
reader is led up with great skill to the final tragedy
—the hero’s execution for alleged cowardice. In
the course of the yarn there is a fine description of
the purely-British part of the landing at Gallipoli.
The book is written with a “purpose,” but the
purpose never spoils the art of the storyteller.
Hugh Corbett’s Wife, by Henry Kitchell Webster
(Hodder and Stoughton, London). Labor unrest and
its solution are the main theme of a yarn which
describes the doings of a rich Chicago “business”
family. The characters are fairly well drawn, and
the color is good.
The Land They Loved, by G. D. Cummins (Mac-
millan, London), begins with rather pleasing pic-
tures of Irish country life ; and all through the book
love of Ireland and intense interest in her problems
have a foremost place. The heroine’s more or less
humorous adventures as a domestic servant in Dublin
are not so good.
The Lady of the Crossing, by Frederick Niven
(Hodder and Stoughton, London). A readable yarn
of the American West which has no special merit.
Characterisation, color, plot and writing are all
fair, with flashes of faint brilliancy.
Strange Roads, by Maud Diver (Constable, Lon-
don i A (retentions book of the poorest sort. Aus-
tralia is traduced in the old way with the old song-
less birds and dreary monotony of dangerous and
ghostly bushland. Also, we are very brutal, blas-
phemous and squalid. It seems sad after Gallipoli.
Mother Love, by Maybanke Anderson (Angus and
Robertson, Sydney). A well-written and logical
book of advice to mothers on the subject of infant
education and upbringing. There are few better text-
books of the type. All its admonitions are illumina-
tive and seem sound.
Cotton, by George Bigwood (Constable, London).
All that anybody can reasonably want to know about
cotton is set down here in a simple direct style.
The historical, statistical and practical aspects of
the plant and the trade are all dealt with. A good
handbook which holds the interest even of the very
general reader.
Young England, by Douglas Strong (Methuen,
London). A story of a very young officer killed
in the Great War who had come fresh from his
English public school. There is a lot of religious
sentiment in the book ; and there is a plea for a
mixture of sport and work as a foundation for a
life of big tilings. The idea is not very new, but
rhe author writes pleasantly and with refreshing
enthusiasm.
Consequences, by E. M. Delafield (Hodder and
Stoughton, London). A painful book, but rather
powerful. The era is that of Queen Victoria; the
girl is not happy at home. She has trouble and
enters a convent; ten years later she is absolved
from her vows and returns to her people to be more
miserable than ever. After that there is a suicide.
Well written, but overloaded with woe.
8.E.N., by Dorothea Conyers (Methuen, London).
The Irish heroine, who is as reckless and cheerful
as she is short of cash, has difficulty in picking
the rich suitor she likes best. The book is amusing
in parts, and some hunting scenes are worth while.
Elves and Fairies of Ida Rentoul Outhwaite, verses
by Annie R. Rentoul, edited by Grenbry Outhwaite
(Lothian Book Publishing Co., Melbourne). Charm-
ing pictures for children in color and black and
white which will give the youngsters many joyous
hours. There is the real feeling of an Australian
fairyland; and the verses which accompany the pic-
tures are simple, unpretentious and with the true
child note. The publishers and printer have done
their work well.
The Hardwoods of Australia and their Economics,
by Richard T. Baker. This is a very valuable pub-
lication, issued by authority of the State of N. S.
Wales, in which the most important Australian
timbers are dealt with exhaustively, yet in a maimer
which is not too technical for the intelligent person
who has to handle the timber itself. The book is most
carefully and systematically done, with illustrations
which make every point dear. The color-plates are
finely printed and show the grains of the various
trees in such a way that a reference to them will
enable the practical worker to determine at a
glance the kind of timber he is handling. The de-
scriptions in the letterpress are equally useful; and
statistics of relative hardness and strength have been
worked out. In the third part of the book full
information is given as to the uses of the woods
described. As well as articles on the seasoning
and preserving of timber, there is information about
building, bridge construction, interior fittings, fenc-
ing, charcoal, fuel, turnery, veneers, carriage-build-
ing and half a dozen other matters of direct con-
cern to the tradesman who is looking for the best
material of his craft. In a word, the bushman and
every kind of wood-worker will find here in a con-
cise and easily-available form all the knowledge they
are likely to require about Australian hardwoods.
If the fine publication has a fault it is the rather
noisy frontispiece showing the Australian hardwood
articles used in launching the Torrens, backed by
flags; but the reader can pass that by for the really
precious contents of the work itself.
The Vindication of Greek National Policy sounds
liked a learned history of the subterranean ways. of
King Tino’s policy. It is really the Athenian
Hansard report of a debate on the subject. The
speakers included Messrs. Venizelos, Kafantares,
Repoules, Polites, Xeros, Bellianites, Stratos, Bousios,
Kurapanos, Skoulas, Lycourezos, Notaras, Kanares,
Zavitsianos, Karpetopoulos, Pneumatikos, Kolonias,
Floros, Diamantides, Embirikos, Lekanides, Gkekos
Tsirimokos and (he is a blessed relief) Popp. The
Greek Parliament must have been an interesting
place before the Deluge, when Mr. Plesiosauroso-
poulus was Minister for Fisheries and Mr. Boacon-
strictorides spoke at some length.
The Book of Strange Loves, by Regina M. Bloch
(John Richmond, London). A set of 12 picturesque
love stories, ranging in period from the first Pharaohs
to King Arthur. Most of them have historical
foundations. The descriptive work is well done and
the succession of barbaric scenes is a blaze of color.
The Billibonga Bird, The Simple Jaggajay, and
The Chewg-um-blewg-um, three attractive booklets
of children’s verse written and illustrated by Harold
Gaze. The author, who is a brother of Leslie Gaze,
the actor, shows a distinguished strain of fantasy
that ripples without effusiveness in his rhymes and
dinky little black-and-white and color drawings.
Undoubtedly he scores markedly as a fanciful illus-
trator. Every one of his diagrams is the credo of
his faith in gnomes and fairies. (Whitcombe and
Tombs, publishers.)
The Riddle of Industry, by old Australian poli-
tician Wallace Nelson, is a capable little book
which, it is claimed, “goes to the roots of the
industrial question.” The much-debated industrial
question seems to be in the main a matter of the
proper division of the takings among labor, capital
and organising or managing ability. It also touches,
but less often than might be expected, on the matter
of having some takings to divide. The class which
devotes itself most largely to the discussion of the
industrial problem maintains that labor should have
all the profits, the other two factors being superflu-
ous, and it takes the existence of the profits for
granted. Of Lane’s disastrous communistic experi-
ment of New Australia-in-Paraguay Mr. Nelson says:
“Now in New Australia one of these factors was
absent. The labor was there and the land was there,
but the capital was absent. The result was that
they had to work with primitive tools. Their labor,
therefore, was very unproductive. Had they had
plenty of capital”....
But, in fact, New Australia had a valuable land
grant and some cash assistance from a brown-rfian
Government, and it had capital of its own, for
paupers weren’t admitted. Yet presently it found
that, though it had labor and capital, its members
couldn’t or wouldn’t employ either in the absence of
the third factor, in the form of an organiser or
manager with authority. (The Manufacturer Pub-
lishing Co., Sydney.)
The Inky Way
“Dusty Folio” : When the Commonwealth
Parliament began the “Historical Records
of Australia” the Birtish authorities set
their face against the publication of Colonial
State papers of later date than 1837. This
meant that a lot of Governors’ despatches
and other important documents now pre-
served in London ’were inaccessible. It
looked like pure cussedness ; qnd the position
has been so far abandoned'that documents
up to 1860 have now been made available.
This gives the Commonwealth really more
than it wants, as it is not likely to con-
tinue the records beyond the coming of re-
sponsible government. So far 11 volumes
have been published, and Dr. Watson has
two more ready. The first series will prob-
ably be finished in 16 volumes, but there are
several other series in view—in particular
one each dealing with exploration and law.
“I'.J.”: Apropos the recent Bulletin
story of the efforts made by one or two
people to suppress or emasculate “The
Felonry of New South Wales,” Dr. Deeper
says that Trin. Col. (Melb. Uni.) library con-
tains a complete copy. Dr. Deeper nearly
fainted when it was lately suggested that
a copy of the second folio of Shakspeare, a
treasured antique, should be sold. Perhaps
some syndicate (on one side or the other)
would be prepared to bid even higher for
the “Felonry” than for the antique, said to
be fellow to one that realised £3300.
In the way of freak issues London Daily
Mail scored on June 30 with a Golden

“Biologist”: “Alan B.” (B. 9/10/’l9) gives
an unfair interpretation of my statements. I
do not “rail” at newspapers, but state certain
facts and their probable cause. A biologist is
not a partisan with a panacea; he Ims no
mission to save society; rather, he is an inter-
ested reporter. My conclusion was that uni-
versal education (such as it is) has reduced
the quality of newspapers. Take as a
parallel .to the newspaper a schoolmaster
whose half-taught class is suddenly diluted
with untaught children. Of necessity his
average teaching would be more elementary.
Yet to affirm this is not to “rail” at the
schoolmaster. Biology suggests that the end
of government is not the ruling of an ignorant
mass by an in-
telligent minor-
ity, but the
levelling up of
the mass. Thus
it appears better
for a people, at
a given stage,
to govern itself
badly rather
than be well
governed by
others. And
Nature is not

“Mac”: “Zanthus” (B. 2/10/’l9) com-
plains that doctors (who “are supposed to be
intelligent and see a lot of life”) don’t con-
tribute much to literature. Probably they
are so busy investigating things that help to
keep “Zanthus” alive that they haven’t much
time to put their literary accomplishments
into print. He mentions Sir Thos. Browne,
Smollett, Wendell Holmes and, “of course,
Conan Doyle.” Has “Zanthus” read
Wm. Andrew Maclvenzie’s “Rowton House
Rhymes”? He was a sticlcit medico, and this
volume of his is one of the finest achievements
in literature. Sir Ronald Ross, to whose
investigations into the cause of malaria
humanity owes a big debt, was a poet as well.
Dr. Robert Macfie in his “Romance of Medi-
cine” establishes himself as a literary man.
Sir Frederick Treves, after removing King
Edward’s appendix, found time to write
some charming books. And isn’t C. H.
Souter, of Adelaide, a medical man? There
are others, but my telephone is ringing.
P.S. —It sounds like twins!
Nat Gould finished strong. During the
war he wrote, it is said, no fewer than 22
books; but their publication was held over
until there was a better supply of paper.
It is doubtful whether there ought ever to
be enough paper to permit a man to print
22 books written in 44 years.
The cable told us lately that “six mem-
bers of the A.I.F. who being
brought from French prisons to serve in an
English gaol” had escaped from a moving
train after ill-using their guards. Then it
turned out that there was one Australian
in the band! Last March 40 A.I.F. “de-
serters” were reported to be briganding in
a wood near Charleroi. The outlaws were
rounded up, and it was found that but three
of them were Australians—the rest wer’
Tommies and poilus, with a leavening of
Boches. The Journal de Charleroi
(12/3/T9), commenting on the episode, said
drily:—-
II faut done etr; circonspect ct re pas toujours
jeter la pierre aux soldats Australiens, en leur
attribuant tousles mefaits qui se commettent ehez
nous.
It is a sentiment which requires to be taken
to heart by several Australian papers.
Almost any Digger will translate the sen-
tence for them.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Oh, brother poets, ye who write
Those comic rhymes I read in print.
And of whose output there’s no stint,
Js your task, like your verses, light?
Or do you ever tear your hair,
As I do, when ideas won’t come ?
In moments of de-lir-i-um
I wonder do you ever swear!
I wonder do you waste the ink.
And even wear out pens before
Your trickling humor starts to pour,
And do you-ever take to drink?
I wonder do his readers know—
Or, knowing, care a single d—n
How just to make an epigram
A bard must nearly “dotty” go?
Is it I’ve lost my sense of fun,
Mislaid my punch? Oh, lend your aid,
Ye brother bards, slick at your trade,
And tell me how the job is done.'

It has been explained, apparently on official
authority, that Australian ribbon manufac-
turers have so far failed to reproduce the
exact shade of orange which is the centre
color of the general-service ribbon worn by
soldiers who have served abroad. The Man-
nix influence, of course.
“F.N.”: Australia can do it all right, and
at the right price, too, when it rolls up its
sleeves. A Melbourne manufacturer has
come forward with a line of oxides and
ochres at three-ha’pence a pound, a quota-
tion which means a big reduction on the
price of the imported article.
Melbourne fluff-shops are advertising wraps
in the “dolman style” for Springtime wear.
It is a quaint resurrection. There is a dol-
man in most old families, and sometimes it i
is brought out by grandma for use as a
comfort on chilly evenings. It is cut some-
thing like a grasshopper’s body and a little
like a duck’s back, with a peculiar excres-
cence at the rear originally designed to allow
for the bustle worn in grandma’s prime. But
the few seen in Melbourne streets have had
the bustle-section flattened out. The duckish
effect remains, however.
Imitation being the sincerest form of flat-
tery, Melbourne has decided to pay homage
to Sydney by endeavoring to form a State
orchestra on N. S. Wales lines. It is noted
with interest that the committee appointed
at the meeting of citizens included Ormond
Professor Laver and Frank Tate (two old
Castlemaine boys, who ought to be able to
make their towny, Lawson, listen to rea-
son) ; Aikman, M.L.C., the Mayor-elect,
who is showing that he can handle people;
and Professor Scott, who is the husband of
a musician, and can speak and write
compellingly on subjects in which he takes
an interest.
A telegraphist taps out his message
The Department insists upon all telegraphists (on
the permanent staff only) passing what is known as
a “Wheatstone test” before they can advance beyond
£156 per annum. This has been the practice ever
since the introduction of Wheatstone working to
Australia. But why do they still insist upon passing
a test of speed on the hand-puncher, an obsolete
appliance which was years ago replaced by the Gell
perforator? To show the inconsistency of the thing,
some officers have been allowed to advance without
ever passing the prescribed test. This is due in
many cases to the fact that they did not happen to
be at a Wheatstone station when they reached that
particular stage of their career; yet others who
have the misfortune to be at a Wheatstone station
when such time occurs are not permitted to advance
beyond £156 a year, and all further increments are
deferred until they can do the unnecessary test.
Mrs. Maxwell Gumbleton, wife of the
Bishop of Ballarat, thinks she has now been
long enough in Australia to tell us how to
bring up our children. It’s the parents'
fault. They don’t whack ’em enough -
My old gardener in England put it in a nutshell
when he said that when he was a lad, if he got a
thrashing at school he dared not mention it at
home, for then he would get another.
Dared not mention it at home! Dared not
be frank ! Dared not take either his father
or his mother into his confidence.' No won-
der Little Willie was so often a dreadful
little liar. The most consistent and danger-
ous perjurers, if their early lives. were to
be closely examined, would surely be found
to have come from those homes where,
thrashings being the regular thing for petty
misdemeanors, Willie lied his way out of
trouble as often as possible.
“Broker”: Curiously, the hanging up of
tariff reform has hit some importers. Many
of them are heavily in debt through exces-
sive bond clearances, made in the confident
belief that Hughes’s return would mean an
immediate’ revision of imposts. On the first
occasion during the war when the tariff
was dealt with, it was eneral knowledge to
wholesalers weeks b-efo hand that increases
were due, and clearances were huge. But
when the news leaked out six weeks before
the second increase (Sept., 1918). fearing
perhaps that when the new duties were at
last imposed there would be nothing left
to clear, headquarters limited the daily pay-
ment of duty to the daily average of a year
previously. Even this was not wholly effec-
tive ; for many firms, assured now that
something was coming, squeezed out of bond
the last penn’orth to which they were en-
titled. Many who got in early were on
velvet; and several firms’ duty payments
exceeded by many thousands of pounds their
normal clearances at that time. In most
cases no one benefited but the profiteer. He
lay low, and doled out “rationed” supplies
till the new tariff was actually announced ;
then his prices went up with a jolt.
"Henry Horsecollar” on an old topic
The eternal matter of the unhealthiness of the
Broken Hill mines has turned up seven or eight
times more in the N. S. Wales Assembly. According
to Brookfield, M.L.A., five years’ work underground
will undermine any constitution, and 80 per cent,
of the workers are suffering from industrial disease.
The inferences, of course, are that the harassed
Government should “do something” with a lot of
money in it, and be discredited for not doing some-
thing before, and that a new Government should be
formed with Brookfield in it, As a matter of fact,
there are occupations which couldn’t be made healthy
even with a £20,000,000 loan, and even though
Brookfield held all the portfolios and was leader of
the Opposition as well. Two of them are lead-mining
and opium eating, and habitual suicide is a third.
The obvious course, if Brookfield’s story is true, is
to stop the export of lead; to mine for our own
use only; to fix the price high (we could fix it
then) ; and to pay such wages—or perhaps such pen-
sions—to the handful of miners required as would
balance the risks. Then Broken Hill, being a
smaller but more durable place, could do without a
separate member, so that Considine could seek a
healthier locality or spread himself over a larger
area; and also Brookfield, not being so much torn
by emotion, would live longer. I hate to think of
Brookfield’s life being shortened by emotion. Mean,
while I notice that the Government has let con-
tracts in England for about £2,000,000 worth of
ships, and there are many more such contracts to
follow. I would suggest cancelling these and build-
ing the ships here, with special encouragement to
young miners who are not yet hopelessly poisoned t 6
learn the healthy new business. It would be per-
manent, anyhow, which lead-mining isn’t. There
is nothing that I can see in nationalising the indus-
try so long as it is an exporting industry. Nation-
alisation doesn’t necessarily mean health. For in-
stance, war is a nationalised business.


ound Formula
It is the fashion among certain sections
of the community to sneer at Proprietary
Medicines, but in many cases there
is considerable self-interest behind the
sneer. In spite of this attempt to discredit
all Proprietary Medicines, thousands of people are using, for
instance, Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, and get just the
results they are looking for; and no amount of sneering and
attempts to discredit them can alter the opinion of people
who know by experience that they are using a useful and
effective medicine, and at a fraction of what it would cost to
be running to a doctor or chemist. These pills are based on
a sound formula and produced by men of experience. There
is nothing known about pills that they do not know, there is
no ingredient that is known to be effective for the Liver, for
aiding Digestion and purifying the Blood that they do not
know. It is their business to know. They not only know
these ingredients, but they know how to compound them so
as to secure the highest efficacy. Just as any cake, omelet, or any article
of food can be hopelessly spoiled because the cook is incompetent, and even
when given the best materials absolutely fails to make an eatable article,
when another cook, using the same materials, accomplishes a result that is
a delight. So it is in compounding Drugs, only even to a greater degree.
The ingredients used in producing Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are of
the highest standard, and they are selected to secure the best results, and
in proportions to doubly secure this. Some people are always sceptical
about a Proprietary Medicine, but does it not stand to reason that it
costs as much for machinery and labor to produce a poor pill as a
good one P In one case satisfaction is given because the article
is good, and in the other dissatisfaction because it is valueless.
Dr. MORSE’S INDIAN ROOT PILLS
are a good , ill in every sense of the word, a fact that is abundantly proved by the thousands who continue to use
them year after year as their sole remedy for all the little ilis of Life. They are prepared under the best possible
conditions, and there is no better Pill made in this or any other country for Biliousness, Constipation Liver and
Kidney Troubles, etc. The care taken In the production of these Pills is illustrated by the manner in which they
are packed. Instead of being put up in cheap wooden boxes—that absorb poisonous and other substances—they are
packed in glass bottles, at a cost of five or six times that of wooden boxes. The extra cost is more than made up in
the satisfaction of knowing that the Pills reach the public just as they left the laboratory, unaffected by moisture or
climatic changes, and free from contamination by contact with foreign matter. Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a
purely vegetable sugar-coated medicinal preparation, carefully compounded by experts, and are manufactured on the
premises under the direct supervision of the Proprietors.

Weld your metal products
cess--
this way!
THE Thomson Electric Welding Process
puts new life into the production of
metal goods from sheet, bar or pipe.
Here you have a picture show-
ing a Thomson Butt Welder
welding 1 5-inch pipe in 1 i
minutes. The mere fact that
the Thomson Electric Butt
Welder enables you to join
short lengths of pipe and
eliminate couplings means a
tremendous saving in materials
and labor. But the Thomson
Electric Process does more
than that —it gives a perma-
nent joint instead of a leaky
connection, and produces at a
remarkable speed. No matter
how stiff the pace the Thom-
son responds—the machine
does the work, all the operator
does is clamp the pipe in the
Thomson Butt Welder, bring
the two ends together and turn
on the current. It makes
continuous coils and makes
them at a ridiculously low cost.
The Thomson Electric Welding Process has great service to offer any factory producing metal
goods—sheet, bar or pipe. It means tremendous output, great economy in labor and continuous
service. We will show you, without obligation, just what Thomson Electric Process can do tor
you, if you simply ask us.

“Yaeko” : The first licensed hotel in South
Aus. did a roaring trade at Yellde, near the
Bluff, Victor Harbor, the chief customers
being the men from Hart’s whaling station
close handy. The room in which they made
merry is now used as a church. Simpson
Newland wove his plot in “Paving the Way”
round the old whaling station.
“Radio” : No D.S.O. has been awarded yet
to the bright officer who, being instructed to
put a captured enemy wireless station out
of commission, never thought to place an
armed guard on it or remove portion of the
machinery, but got to work on a set of
beautiful instruments with an axe!
A roll of thunder from the Defence Depart-
ment’s fashion expert:—•
Field Service Dress with Trousers must be worn
by all officers attending evening functions at Federal
Government House.
It is not clear from this whether in the
past officers have been in the habit of at-
tending without trousers, or whether they
may do so in the future except in the even-
ing.;.
“Rusty”: It is the telephonic repetition
which occasionally makes the Telegraph De-
partment look silly. But sometimes it
works out all right. A butcher in a small
Gippsland settlement wired a Melbourne
firm to “Send three tallow casks. A week
later the butcher was asked to take delivery
of “three tons of chaff.” For three days
the consignee refused to touch the stuff.
Then chaff rose a pound a ton, and he settled.
While Holman professes to know nothing
as to when N.S.W. Agent-General Made is
leaving London, the latter, in a letter to
John Storey, Leader of the Labor Opposi-
tion, stated definitely that lie expected to get
away from the Fog about December next.
It is significant that Storey should be the
medium of letting the public know this, and
this lends color to the yarn that in Ins re-
tirement Wade is not going to study the con-
venience or the interests of the Holman
Government.
“Mentor” : Some of the flour we are getting
out here in the Far West (N.S.W.) takes
beating. A few bags of the stuff were re-
ceived at Mt. Sturt and Yandama stations.
The cook at Mt. Sturt tried to knock some
into a batch of oread, but failed miseiably.
He then tossed the failure out to the fowls,
and a few hours later found several of them
dead. At Yandama the flour was given to
the blacks and made them very ill; m tact,
one of them afterwards died in Tibooburra
Hospital. And we had to pay £l6 per ton
carriage on the rubbish from Broken Hill.
A Melbourne boot manufacturer called at
the house of a near relation the other day
and was shown a pair of boots purchased
at a city retail shop for £2 25., and the
woman who bought them thought they were
“very cheap as things go nowadays. Die
manufacturer examined the footwear, and
then mentioned that as the retailer was sup-
plied by his own firm at 10s. lid. the load-
ing for exes, and profit was 150 per cent.
This was regarded as the most striking item
on the menu when Vic. State members were
serving up pro.fiteering titbits in the lobbies
the other evening.
“Threehooks” : I want to tell that hard-
en-ed old salt, Joe Cook, that I and other
sailors consider a breach of faith has been
committed by the Navy Department. I left
Australia in 1914 and returned in the same
ship in 1919. We had heard all about the
leave we were going to get on our return,
and had listened to various promises, official
and otherwise. We started the leave all
right, but were recalled by telegrams to
rejoin the fleet for the “northern cruise
Now, would not any reasonable person think
that after four and a half years of the real
stuff we could afford to miss this trip, which
at its best could only consist of playing at
war ? ■ , p
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos Sydney’s old church or
St. James, which forms part of the Law
Courts building in King-street. Up to the
time of the dedication of this chuich. bv
Parson Marsden, in 1523, all ecclesiastical
matters were controlled by the Civil Govein-
ment. The chaplains were officers appointed
and paid by the State. The service in 1823
drew the attention of the English Church
authorities to the position, with the result
that Australia was attached to the See of
Calcutta, where Reginald Heber, of “Green-
land’s Icy Mountains,” wore apron and
gaiters ; and this mode of government con-
tinued until Archdeacon Broughton was
appointed Bishop of Australia in 1836.
“Iota”: When the Commonwealth ships
are all finished a few hundred platers, rivet-
ers and engineers will have to go to Japan
or somewhere for a job. The prospect of
more Australian shipbuilding is hardly a
prospect at all. The engines for the few
ships we’ve got in hand are nearly ready.
Assembling is the only thing now left to do,
and it looks as if the Castlemaine workers
will have to shift up to the Mallee and live
on rabbits and bran. Unless he is a sewing-
machine specialist or a harvester expert any
mechanic is liable to be soon looking for a job
at anything at all. —P.S. : It is a solemn
fact that, while I was waiting to post the
foregoing, I got word that I was put off
“owing to slackness.” But, bless your heart,
we’re in no hurry. We can easily wait for
a tariff until Billy has a few elections.
A Melbourne baker’s carter tells the yarn:
Take my round. Fully half the old girls I'm serv-
ing have a bit on once in a way, and a score of
them never let a week pass without a little flutter.
If I’d stand and talk horse to them I wouldn’t get
over the run in a month of Sundays. I passed ’em
a few good tips, and now it’s worth my while to
get out to the course every Saturday and every
whole day off to put my clients’ money on. I give
you my word it isn’t unusual for me to be entrusted
with 20 quid to execute little commissions. A
house-to-house agency can be carried on under cover
of the bread basket, and though it doesn’t give
sufficient scope there is more in it than in the bread
trade for me. I deal with one booky for a small con-
sideration, and the ladies tip me a fair rake-off on
every win. The man who could link up the whole
suburban system of bread delivery with a little
scheme for gathering the ladies’ bets might find a
million in it. Take it from me, there’s scores of
others doing what I’m doing, especially the Mandarin
who brings the vegetables. John Sin is a great old
- sport these days, and lie’s going to be my most
dangerous rival with the housewives of my suburb.

MISS ESTELLE RAY, a charming Rexona Girl.
(From a photo by Sidney Riley.)
Rexona Soap Will Make You
Happy and Beautiful.
I have been using your Rexona Soap for some time, and I think so much
of it I am writing a few lines to express my appreciation. Not only do I find it
excellent for the toilet and bath, but as a shampoo for the hair it is far superior
to any other, for it makes the hair both soft and silky, and seems to take away
every trace of dandruff. ,
I have also used your Rexona; nothing could be better as a healer.
I can truly say I am a Rexona G'rl, and wish the Rexona Remedies every
success.
Sincerely yours (Sgd.) ESTELLE RAY.
Rexona Soap Gives Natural
Beauty to SRin and Hair.
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be obtained
by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary Toilet Soaps do not assert
this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy
its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and
protect the skin. Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic balsams
as Rexona the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections is
known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once
or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen the
tendency to pimples and leave the complexion clear, fresh and velvety. Don’t forget
Rexona Soap is the Aristocrat of Soaps, unequalled for the toilet, nursery and bath.
Large and lasting tablet, price 1 /-.
Rexona—the Triangular Shaving Stick
A New Rexona Product.
Here is a new idea in Shaving Soap—another Rexona triumph—one this time which will be appreci-
ated by men wherever beards grow. Rexona Shaving Soap contains the same Oils and Essences that have
made Rexona famous the world over, and is made on the Rexona formula, and thus makes a Shaving Stick
which is a soap and lotion combined. It makes for comfort and hygiene in shaving, and tempers the skin
against wind and bad weather.
REXONA SHAVING STICK (medicated) is Rexona Soap specially treated so as to produce a
thick, creamy lather, which will soften the beard and improve the skin at the same time. It is deli-
cately perfumed and medicated on the same principles as Rexona, and not only produces a lasting-
lather but purifies and leaves the skin in perfect condition. Being an antiseptic Medicated Soap, it
has a tendency to quickly heal any cut you may have the misfortune to get, and if troubled with
pimples or blotches of any kind will daily tend to improve them.
REXONA SHAVING SOAP is the highest standard of Shaving Soap that it is possible to produce,
and a good Shaving Soap means everything to a shave, for if the beard is properly lathered a shave is
a delight; but if the beard is not properly lathered but is stiff and harsh, it is not only severe on the user
but hard on the razor.
EVERYONE knows how delightful Rexona Soap is for the toilet, and Rexona Shaving Soap will be
found equally as pleasant for shaving. No cake of Rexona Soap and no stick of Rexona Shaving Soap
is ever marketed unless in perfect condition, for we market Rexona Soap as the finest of the fine, and
the scientific skill employed in its manufacture and the absolutely first quality of materials used
produce in Rexona Soap and Rexona Shaving Soap, soaps of superlative quality which represent the
highest possible standard that we can offer to the public, regardless of expense.
MR. BOYD IRWIN PRAISES REXONA SHAVING SOAP.
For years I have used Rexona Soap for Shaving. To my surprise ny chemist
handed me last week a perfect little triangular bar of the new Rexona Shaving Stick.
I must write and congratulate you on: (1) the appearance of Rexona Shaving Sticky
(2) the beautiful quality of it as a toilet requisite, and (3) its lathering and healing
qualities. A perfect Australian Shaving Soap is something new. Again I congratulate
you.

Mr. BOYD IRWIN. (From a photo, by Monte Luke.)
REXONA SHAVING SOAP will be found the most economical Shaving Stick on the market, hut care should be exercised not to dip the Stick in the
water, but wet the face and apply the Shaving Soap dry. A few applications with the shaving brush will quickly produce a thick, creamy lather which
lastj and thoroughly softens the beard, leaving the skin in a healthy and hygienic condition after the shave. Everyone should use a Medicated Soap for
shaving, for, after going over the face with a razor and removing the beard, the skin needs a protection from the germs carried by the dust which every-
one has to face.
Rexona Shaving Soap is something entirely new in every respect. Watch for the triangular enamelled
pox, tor Rexona Shaving Stick is not round, like the old-fashioned kinds, but triangular, and packed in a trian-
gular enamelled box, tasty and neat, easy to hold, and dainty in every respect.
Rexona Shaving Stick is sold everywhere at 1/6, or, if unable to procure locally, will be sent post free upon
receipt ot the price, 1/6, by the Sole Proprietors, Rexona Proprietary Company, 131-5 Clarence Street, Sydney.

equalled antiseptic, cooling, soothing and healing ointment. It is the greatest skin remedy of the

Another N. S. Wales Anglican Church,
St. Luke’s, Liverpool, will presently cele-
brate its' centenary. The building was com-
pleted in 1819, and local people claim that it
is the oldest complete Anglican edihce m
Australia. St. John’s, Parramatta, though
in name at least much older, lias had a new
body; but the old spires still stand.
There was a curious combination in Adel-
aide lately. The 500 Syrians there enter-
tained Papal Delegate Cattaneo and other
R.C. notables, who handsomely admitted that
the hosts were “the oldest members of the
Church.” Attiah, their spokesman, neatly
remarked that the Syrians were the first to
preach Christianity in the East, and the
Irish followed by spreading it in the West.
(Applause.)
“U.P.”: At the request of E. A. Brooks,
of Clifton Hills and Kanowa stations (S.A.),
Captain Butler is in communication with
the Sopwith Co. with a view to securing a
’plane for station jobs. Brooks has specially
in mind the advantage of an aerial service
for medical work. During the last tew
months, he says, three men have died on
his stations whose lives might have been
saved had medical help been promptly avail-
able.
An Adelaide workman, charged with “hav-
ing unlawfully committed an act in the
nature of a strike,” made the simple defence
that he had on the contrary been sacked.
The factory boss explained that there had
been friction over the action of a foreman,
and, finding a discussion in progress during
working hours, he said: “This is no place
for a stop-work meeting. Get along out-
side.” The man contended that, coupled with
other acts, this was a summary dismissal,
and the Industrial Court concurred.
“0.K.”: My experiences as a match-buyer
in Melbourne are disheartening. The grocer,
like the tobacconist, seems to be always out
of the locally-manufactured Bryant and
May. Objecting to Japanese and Swedish
matches, I was supplied with a brand of
“safety” which had “London” conspicuously
on the label. That looked consoling. The
British match would do as a substitute until
the Australian had ousted all competitors.
Then I closely examined the product of the
new London-co., and found, printed in very
small letters, “Made in Norway.” I’d like
to see a list of shareholders in that London
co. whose goods are made in Norway.
A. R. Gardiner was flogging the Holman-
Fuller Administration for its discreditable
appointment of Marks to the chairmanship of
the Public Service Board at a salary of
£2500 a year. He said :
The consensus of opinion amongst civil servants
is not only that Marks’s appointment is an insult to
the Service, but that he is not even an ornament
to the position. At the end of his period of service
in five years he is to receive a pension. My opinion
is that he was only appointed to the position in
order to give him a pension. .. .The only justifica-
tion given out through the press for the appointment
was that Marks was a relative of some kind or other
of a Minister of the Crown. There was, I believe, a
second justification; it was that he had in his youth
played marbles in some village on the South Coast
with a Minister of the Crown.
Gardiner didn’t even mention that Marks was
a highly-qualified marble-player, but no doubt
he is.
The president of the Master Bakers’
Assoc. (Vic.) has explained how a leading
local member like David Hennessy could
afford to be five times Gaud Mayor of Mel-
bourne, and was clearly disposed to hold
the billet for the term of his natural life.
It was by supplying cafes and restaurants
with their bread at a loss. They all do it,
it seems, if they aspire to wealth. At any
rate, the president of the M.B.A. assured
the chairman of the High Prices Commis-
sion that cafes and hotels got their bread
at under cost. “Then bakers supply them
at a loss?” asked the chairman. “Certainly
they do, and are keen to get the business,”
answered George Washington. How they
manage to grow rich by selling 9d. loaves
for 6|d. the president didn’t explain, but
perhaps the large sale of bread for 9d.
may account for the lack of insolvencies.
Adelaide University is in trouble for want
of space. Dozens of newcomers after Christ-
mas will have to be refused admission unless
buildings are put in hand at once. Ques-
tions bring the reply from the Government
that, in the present state of S.A. finance,
when the shears have to be used everywhere,
no money can be given even for’ such a
necessary purpose. But there is a bigger
trouble ahead. The institution, with public
buildings close to it on each side and a
steep riverbank at the back, has not and
cannot get enough room. It has been sug-
gested that it might go out to suburban
Parkside and take over "the Asylum for the
Insane; but that would mean a very big im-
mediate outlay, even if the main idea were
approved. The only thing possible for the
moment seems to be the erection of class-
rooms and laboratories which will serve im-
mediate needs without being a dead loss if
given over a few years hence to some other
purpose.
“Otira” : The port of Patea, in Taranaki
(M.L.), is the fifth in the land in point of
quantity of produce sent out. Of cheese
alone £1,250,000 worth is shipped every year.
The harbor looks little more than a ditch,
with two moles running out into the
breakers; but it has an interesting history,
for pakeha ships were not the first to use it.
Over 800 years ago a Maori canoe blew
into the river. It was the first, so far as
records show, to come to Aoteroa from the
east. Its name was Takatuma, and the
captain was Turi, a bold Polynesian, who
eventually coasted to Hokianga—literally,
“the place of return”—and then set sail
for Hawaiki again. The skipper and his
crew were two years in Maoriland. They
had to wait to grow taro and kumara for
food on the voyage. Many years passed
ere the Tainui and Arawa and other canoes
followed the pathfinder’s track across the
seas. They discovered harbors in many
places; but they always kept Patea in re-
membrance. And when the pakeha came he
established a reserve on the river-bank where
Turi landed nearly 1000 years ago.

Beware of those dizzy spells that so often affect
you -- “ Vertigo ” is what the doctors call it.
■ ■
Livepomph Pictures
by —
Oiambeplmn's
Tablets -
It is often accompanied by that tired
feeling, absence of appetite and extreme
nervousness. It is your liver that is
wrong; you are bilious —this means a
poor circulation, a congested brain, a
disordered stomach, constipated bowels.
Chamberlain’s Tablets for the stomach
and liver are what you need —they act
directly on the liver. You need only
one each night for a few nights and you
will soon be right again.
Those affected with dizzy spells
should be most particular about their
bowels. If they do not move during
the day do not wait until another day
but take one of Chamberlain’s Tablets
that very night.
You may think this a very trifling
matter, yet the more you study this
question the more you will be convinced
of the great importance of having these
daily movements of the bowels.
For biliousness, constipation, belching,
gas on the stomach, foul breath, head-
ache, bloating, etc., there is nothing
to equal
\dIAIJI n UDVrUOXSiSKL

Diarrhoea.
Diarrhoea attacks all ages, and is equally
fatal to young and old. The great danger in
this disease is due to the frequent lack of
proper treatment in the first stages. Chamber-
lain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy is a reliable
and effective medicine, and if given in time
will prevent serious results. It never fails, and
is pleasant to take. Every household should
have a bottle on hand. Get it today. Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy taken at
the first unusual looseness of the bowels will
save suffering and anxiety—and loss of both
ime and money.
Take It With You.
The importance of having a bottle of Cham-
berlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy with
them is realised by experienced travellers, as
this medicine cannot be bought on the train or
steamship. Change of water and diet often
deranges the stomach and bowels and produces
diarrhoea. As Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy is the most reliable medicine
in use for these ailments, care should be taken
to have a bottle always on hand. Attacks of
bowel trouble nearly always come on suddenly
and when this remedy is at hand all danger
laay be avoided.
Be Firmi
When you ask for a bottle of Chamberlain’s
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy, do not be per-
suaded to take anything else. Be firm in your
conviction that there is nothing so good. This
medicine has been tested in the most severe
cases of cramp, colic, dysentery and diarrhoea,
and has never been known to fail. “ Can be
depended upon” is an expression always used
in connection with Chamberlain’s Colic and
Diarrhoea Remedy. One bottle goes a long
way towards relieving suffering humanity. It
never fails to give immediate and permanent
relief.

A cold in the head will soon disappear if the throat and
nose passages are frequently cleansed with “Vaseline"
Borated. Also gives relief from catarrh.
Composed of mildly antiseptic borax and soothing “Vase-
line’’ Jelly. Use on the eyelids when inflamed or sore,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
AIW. —“Toreisi!”. .. “S’ake’r'up !"
m 1 ... “G’wan!” ... “Ger’r’out !”
£ S “Dibura —pall in!” The pande-
monium of rattling buckets, squeaking
binges, and babble of many tongues ceases
while the warder laboriously counts his
charges. I slip on a pair of shoes and walk
across the dewy grass to call the prison-roll
and portion out the various gangs to their
work about the station. The sergeant has
his squad on the parade-ground, and is bark-
ing weird orders to them which only a
native constable can interpret. However, I
am quite a native myself after many years’
knocking about the outside edges of the Ter-
ritory. and I know that “Pas pine” and
“skin pine” are not varieties of timber, but
really “first point,” “second point”—a por-
tion of the bayonet drill. Roll-call completed,
the prisoners retire to breakfast, which I
inspect in the cooking pots, and I join the
sergeant and inspect carbines. As usual,
A. C. Lousi has a dirty rifle, which he as-
sures me was cleaned tivice this morning, but
a Iviwai constable, name not specified, deli-
berately ran a “rusty” rag through the bar-
rel and spoilt the perfect state he (Lousi)
always keeps his arm in. (Note Lousi fof
defaulters’ parade.) Leave parade and dress
half a dozen sore legs, issue Epsom’s to as
many cases of biliousness (wild-pork ration
yesterday), inspect married quarters and
reprimand the ladies for dumping taro peel-
ings in the corners of their rooms. Inspect
barracks and sack cook for building a fire
on verandah of cook-house. Back to bathe,
then breakfast on food badly maltreated by
a savage camouflaged as a cook.
Morning. —An hour in office, writing
letters and recording-documents. Now fol-
lows variety: I repair a leaking tank with
iron and solder, bore out a jambed pull-
through, superintend the erection of a new
cook-house at the gaol, and am busily en-
gaged on the roof of the office hunting for a
leak, when V.C. Idiosi arrives with a train
of women loaded with food for sale. Climb
off roof, buy food and retire to the
roof. Idiosi wakes up, and, after dis-
cussing the vagaries of iron houses and
the skin disease of his youngest hopeful,
tells me he has a “case” for trial.
Lower myself off the roof, repress a long-
ing to slay the V.C., and open Court for
Native Matters. It is all over a lady dog
which was “adopted” by plaintiff’s wife’s
brother’s wife’s father’s nephew, who gave
two of the animal’s progeny to the defend-
ant, who being the nephew’s cousin’s aunt’s
niece’s third husband’s brother-in-law’s
wife’s father, naturally wanted to keep one
puppy for his daughter’s eldest son’s young-
est child, and had sold the second puppy to
two different men, who both claim it and
have brought half a village apiece to testify
in their favor. The superb lying, which has
lasted an hour is interrupted by the arrival
of a crinkly-skinned old gentleman with a
dozen witnesses. lie prefers a claim that
he has not yet been paid by the first plaintiff
for the lady dog. I wrestle with the pro-
blem until lunch, when I give a verdict
which satisfies both claimants —the lady dog
to remain with its “adopted” owner, who is
to distribute its next litter to the second
plaintiff and the two different purchasers of
the second puppy, each successful litigant to
receive a pup. The cheerful crowd adjourns
to the beach to discuss the case, while I
bathe my aching head and toy with a hunk
of tinned “dog” and some soapy taro, my
lunch, for the cook has ruined the fowl I
left with him to bake in the oven.
Afternoon. — Issue uniform to several visit-
ing Y.C.’s, and hear their excuses for not
having the village tracks cleaned, and warn
them what will happen if this work is fur-
ther delayed. Return to the roof and pull
several sheets of iron off, locate the leak,
fill the nail-holes with sheet-lead and replace
the ii’on. Do another hour’s typing-reports
and various letters—then wander about the
station to see how the police and prisoners
are performing the jobs allotted them this
morning. Discover a patch of cocoanut
palms have been attacked by “cabbage
beetle,” so I mix a few buckets of lotion for
to-morrow’s crusade against the pest. Re-
turn to office after 5 o’clock and find a native
teacher waiting to complain that the local
village children have been “wagging it,” and
will I make the parents send the truants to
school? Reply in the affirmative, and send
a messenger to the V.C. to bring the parents
to the station to-morrow. Roll-call at gaol,
the evening drill by the police, and the atten-
tion to the various sore legs, etc., on station
is over as the sun sinks, and I plod back to
my house and superintend the preparation
of dinner. Have a bath, change into pyja-
mas and have a fair dinner, barring the fact
that the cook has boiled the fruit-salad I
took such care over. He explains his “head
be no good, s’pose head belonga me alia same
white man me no can boilem puddin’ alonga
fee-ruta!”
'Night. — Spend the evening smoking and
reading a two-months-old newspaper; the
mail is overdue some 14 days;—a mere trifle
in Papua. Feel a trifle lonely, for I have
not seen a white man for nearly a month;
the patrol-officer has been away in the hills
and visitors have not arrived. Take a pad
around the station at 9 o’clock and see all
lights are out and the sentry is awake at the
gaol. It is a brilliant night of blue sky and
silvery moonshine ; the cocoanut palms on the
flat rustle silver-tipped leaves in the cool
breeze from the hills ; an owl sighs wearily
from the branches of a mango-tree, and I feel
almost miserable. I remember other more
delectable places and wish —no. this is not
life. But I am doing my bit to carry the
White Man’s Burden. The thought bucks
me, so I crawl under the mosquito net and
blow out the light.

“Ex-P.M.”: The telegraph branch hon-
estly tries, so far as the transmitting and
receiving branches are concerned, to give the
public its wires in good time, but it fails
miserably year after year because some
genius pointed out to a too-credulous admin-
istrator that the abolition of the receipt-
books would save money and time. The re-
sult is that there is no check once the mes-
senger gets away from the office. He can, if
he feels inclined, destroy any despatch, take
the time allowance for private reasons, and
when inquiries are made stick to his story of
careful delivery. On the other hand, any
careless or unscrupulous person can land a
recent lad in trouble by denying receipt; and
the Department wastes hours of higher-paid
time in making inquiries. The system is
wasteful as well as dangerous. Then there
is the Departmental remedy for all staff
shortages—the casual messenger. I believe
that if Webster were reported ill or missing,
Central Office would wire, “Engage a casual
messenger.” The casual is usually true to
label, so wires pile up for hours. Yet the
Department warns P.M’.’s that they must let
their mail-boys and messengers off for com-
pulsory drill, and at the same time it holds
them (the P.M.’s) responsible for the carry-
ing on of mail and telegraph work entrusted
to the irresponsible youths. The cable cos.’
boys are exempted from drill. If the public
only realised to what an extent it affects the
first and final stages of letter and telegram
deliveries, they would tell Webster to see
that his mail-boys and messengers were freed
also.

“Gassy” : A hard-doer lately put up a joke
on a Melbourne railway-station tobacconist.
He was out of work, and with fourpence in
his pocket was “dyin’ for a draw.” Sud-
denly he got an inspiration. With a clean
but empty Capstan packet in his tunic he
dived into the shop and bought a packet
of fags, then walked out and immediately
returned with the empty, saying, “What’s
yer game, laddie?” The tobacconist opened
his eyes, looked dubious, but gave him the
benefit of the doubt.
“D.F.”: Whaling on the Tasmanian coast
goes back at least to 1803, when Captain
Ebor Bunker, of the Albion, combined a
little of the business with the job of taking
Bowen and the first settlers to the Derwent.
Bunker mentions that he got three sperm
whales during three days while he lay be-
calmed in Oyster Bay on the east coast. The
next year the Alexander, Captain Rhodes,
had a good run with black whales in the
Derwent itself. Jorgen Jorgenson, the “con-
vict king,’’ claims to have harpooned the
first whale ever caught in the Derwent;
but then Jorgenson was a bit of a liar.

“Here’s How” : Talking of lubricants, it’s
strange that “butcher,” the invariable alias
for a long beer in South Aus., is almost un-
known outside that State. At Casterton or
Ivaniva, on the Vic. side of the border, one
naturally calls for a long ’un, but at Mount
Gambier or Bordertown, just inside the
croweater’s country, to ask for anything but
a butcher is a solecism, and brands you as
an alien.

“Morwong” : Announcing it as “the cheap-
est fish in the world,” the N. S. Wales
State fish depots are advertising skate and
gurnard at 3jd. per lb. The State Fisheries’
idea of “the world” must be limited, for in
San Francisco I have bought sole at 5 cents
the pound—cleaned and excellently fresh.
The same fish filleted sold for 10 cents.
Alongside sole for 5 cents (21d.) the pound
the N. S. Wales skate and gurnard at 33d.
looks like profiteering. The fact is that in
the United States fish is generally cheaper
than in Australia —cheaper and better. The
fish in the N. S. Wales State shops is con-
sistently uninviting in appearance. I doubt
if Americans would buy it at all. Halibut
is the most favored fish both east and
west in the U.S.A. It grows to a great
size, specimens weighing as much as the
average jockey. The flesh is milky-white,
flaky and practically boneless. It is sold in
steaks at 18 cents per lb. Salmon was re-
cently selling on the wharf in San Fran-
cisco at 15 cents, although in steaks it
would cost 20 cents, prime cuts 25 cents.
Compare these two prime fish, halibut
(steaks) 9d. and salmon (steaks) 10d., with
our best fish (snapper, Is. 3d. or Is. 6d.)
and it is obvious how much better served
the American people are. Smelts and fresh
herrings, unknown here, sell at about 0
cents there. Skate, gurnard, barracouta and
flathead, with the exception of the last-
named all second- or third-rate fish, are the
customary denizens of the N. S. Wales State
fish shop windows. And most often they
return one’s gaze with the deadest eyes ever
seen in a fish. In the matter of meat
prices, we have a slight advantage over the
Americans ; but, regarding fish, we pay more
for an inferior article. In New Orleans,
Baltimore, New York, Boston and other
cities, when “oysters r in season” (Ameri-
can fish-shop humor, indicating that the
months with R in their names are good for
oysters), an oyster buffet will open you a
dozen portly oysters for 15 cents, with
tomato catsup, horse-radish, crackers and
other accessories thrown in. In a swank
hotel, of course, the same oysters may cost
you 50 cents, but at a similar oyster coun-
ter in Sydney you will pay one shilling (24
cents) for 10 oysters, mostly undersized, as
against the dozen well developed shellfish
you can get in the U.S. for 15 cents (71d.).
On the Pacific coast oysters are dearer be-
cause the oyster will not grow in the cold
waters of that region. We know in a vague
way that shoals of surface-swimming fishes
frequent our waters, herrings and pilchards,
as well as sea-mullet. There may be others.
Until these shoals are intercepted we shall
never have the plentiful fish supply of other
countries. Instead of assiduously scraping
the sea-bottom for skate the Fisheries De-
partment might go after those shoals once
in a while, if only to show Private Enter-
prise the way.

“Moonshine”: Years ago the Customs
authorities got “the office” that a lot of un-
customed whisky from a wrecked ship was
circulating in the Cape Otway (Vic.) coun-
try, and sent one of Melbourne’s smartest
’tecs to see about it. He seized some of
the real stuff at one farm in the forest, and
learned that an old hand some miles away
also had a supply about the premises. The
’tec put a couple of kegs in his tdap and!
drove across to the other suspect. He took
care to strike the place about dark, and
had to put in the night there. He got
pretty pally with the old man, who brought
out some whisky, but not the real Mackay.
The ’tec kept asking if his host hadn’t any-
thing better, and after a lot of press-
ing the backblocker produced some of
the real stuff. “Now that’s the thing,” said
Sherlock —“where did you get that from?”
“Well, to tell you the truth, mister,” said
Simple Simon, “I borrowed it from the back
of your trap.”

“Kitty Kitty”: Joe Bridle, in town for
the races, asked me to draw out a cheque
for him. As I got my pen to work he bent
over my shoulder and confidingly asked me
to write “Not Sociable” across it. He ex-
plained to me that he was no scholar him-
self, but the missus always did it. It
meant, he further explained, that he wasn’t
takin’ any chances with strangers who might
get hold of the document.

“A.J.S.”: Tne merriest Christmas I ever
witnessed was made so by an enraged Santa
Claus who had been accused of drinking in
business hours by his employer, the pro-
prietor of a Maoriland toyshop. Resenting
a scornful aside from the boss, S. Claus
rose in a welter of indignation and called
upon all present to bear witness that one
nip (from bottle produced) had constituted
his sole alcoholic refreshment during the
afternoon. Then announcing that the emolu-
ments attached to the position were unsatis-
factory, he shouted a few painful details
concerning the proprietor’s pedigree, and con-
cluded by making a vigorous assault on him.
There was an. immediate stampede of the
firm’s customers, but as the fight raged in
the only exit there was no getting out. An
extra turn was provided by a distracted old
woman running amok and “dealing it out”
all round with her umbrella. The scene
ended with the arrest of Santa and the sal-
vage of the toyman from the wrecked re-
mains of his stock-in-trade. Then the young
folk departed homewards to hang up their
stockings.
“Itolco”: Here’s another entry for the
Profiteer Stakes. He’s by Suavity out of
Dago Joint. The other night I and a
pal adjourned to a dingy cafe and
ordered curried prawns. The helpings were
so small that called for an encore of
ham and eggs. When that was put aw r ay,
Signor Andante Fiume handed us the ticket;
it read “2, 95.” There ought to be an open
season for shooting some Dago traders in
Australia.

J.R.C.”: During the sugar shortage a
Chinaman plodded into a grocer’s in Garden
Vale (Vic.) and asked for two pounds.
“None in stock, John.” John lingered at
the counter and asked; “You glocer?” “Yes,
John.” “All li! What you sell —wood?”

A scheme is being hustled along in Mel-
bourne for the establishment of open-air
markets—small markets in each municipality
where producer and consumer can meet
without the middleman butting into the deals.
The scheme would decrease the cost while
increasing the consumption of fruit, vege-
tables, etc., provided Bumble doesn’t plant
his acquisitive paw on it. The fees at
present collected in Victoria Market by the
City Council, almost wholly from citizens of
other municipalities, save the city landlords
3d. or 4d. in the £1 of rates; so that the
city’s rate is Is. 4d. while Brunswick and
Footscray pay 2s. 6d., and Nunawading 2s.
4d. in the £l. And not satisfied with three
markets a week—there used to be but two—•
the city Bumbles now propose a market every
day bar Sunday. They’d run a gospel
market on the Sabbath, too, if they knew
anything about the business.

“George Hooligan’*’: Years ago when I
was a telegraph messenger in what is now
Webster’s Department, I suggested to the
heads that code-words should be used for
stereotyped official wires. For instance, if
a message from Balmain to Bourke was un-
delivered, the S.M. at Bourke would wire
through to the S.M. at Balmain: “With re-
ference to your message to-day addressed to
John Smith, Bourke, please inform sender
it is undelivered owing to addressee having
left.” I remember that I coded this, among
other messages, in three words. The inspec-
tor came to investigate, and he asked me
why I made the suggestion. I was a raw
youngster, so I simply said I thought it
would be helpful. The ass flattened me
with : “You are not paid to think. You are
paid to deliver wires.” I didn’t think that
a department in which brains were of no
value offered much of an opening; so I got
out —and I suppose hundreds of others did
the same. Probably that accounts for a lot
of Webster’s worries to-day.
WHEN A MAN GOES GREY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When a man goes grey an’ the storms of age
Have touched his thatch with a tinge of snow,
It is up to him to turn back Time’s page,
Though his back is bent, an’ his gait runs slow;
For the world won’t wait for the iaggin’ heart —
Since hustle’s the word he must play his part!
When a man grows grey it’s no use to cry
Over time lie’s spilt Or has idly spent,
Or to strike his breast an’ say never dye,
Or voice vain vows that are never meant.
Get the walnut stain, an’ touch out the snow,
An’ jus’ keep it dark so’s the Boss won’t know!
When a bloke goes grey, then old Sorrow’s cup
Just drips right over the bubblin’ brim;
Ev’ry toiler knows that his number’s up,
An’ soon, or late, he will face Fate’s whim ;
He must work his head if he wants to stay,
An’ jus’ keep it dark when his thatch goes grey!

ALKALI CAUSES SOAP
TO INJURE HAIR
Nearly all soaps and ready-mixed shampoos
—even the most expensive—contain too much
alkali, which is dangerous, as it dries the
scalp and makes the hair brittle.
Really the most elegant and safe thing to
use is ordinary colinated cocoanut oil (a pure,
saponified, but quite greaseless liquid), which
is not at all expensive—but is far, far better
than soaps or other scalp-injurious things.
Every chemist keeps a supply of this, and a
few ounces lasts you and mother, sisters and
brothers for months. Just wet the hair with
water and rub it through—thoroughly. One
or two teaspoonfuls is plenty to create a big
quantity of rich, heavy, creamy lather. It
cleanses delightfully and rinses out easily.
The hair dries quickly and easily, and comes
out brilliant, soft, fluffy, wavy and fresh as a
daisy, looking much thicker than it actually
is.
Best of all. this colinated cocoanut oil leaves
the hair as easy to dress again, as though you
hadn’t washed it at all. And yet it loosens
and carries off every bit of excess oiliness,
dust, dirt or dandruff scurf.
PAIN VANISHES! CORNS LIFT OUT
AFTER FEW DROPS.
Let To-day’s Corn Pain be Your Last Corn Pain.
Lift Any Corn or Callous Out with Finger Tips.
Wonderful! Girls! Save it a Corner on Dressing-stand.
f
No bunkum ! No bother! Corns,
callouses —hard or soft—sore or
sensitive —all yield and loosen
and lift off—absolutely pain-
lessly.
This newly-found com-
pound is named Frozol-
Ice, and is still another
use of that great medi-
cal discovery “ether.”
Stop at any chemist’s for
a little bottle of Frozol-Ice,
costing but a trifle, but which is ample
to free the feet from each and every
corn and callous.
Apply some drops on to a delicate
corn or callous. Like a flash the soreness
vanishes, and soon the corn or callous peels
right off with the finger-tips.
Frozol-Ice is absolutely non-irritant, doesn’t
even inflame the surrounding healthy flesh.
.Tust fancy! No agony at all. no sting or sore-
ness while using, or afterwards, simply a
shrivelling, drying up of corns and callouses.
Girls! Save a corner on your dressing-
table for Frozol-Ice. and never be the ‘'wall-
flower” of the ballroom again. .Tust some
drops of Frozol-Ice when corns begin aching.
Pain disappears—corn dies!
True Frozol-Ice is flattered by worthless
imitations. Avoid them by insisting on the
green label.
This Simple Rule
Soon Strengthens
a Delicate Stomach
It really is unnecessary to dose yourself
with pepsin pills or artificial digestives, or to
live on a miserable nursery diet. If you will
observe one easy rule you can eat the hearty,
nourishing foods that your appetite craves
and your body needs. That rule is to take
a teaspoonful of Salix Magnesia in a half-
glass of hot water with each meal. Salix
Magnesia is non-laxative, and harmless, and
possesses medicinal qualties that promptly
overcome impaired digestion, fermentation,
acidity, catarrhal conditions of the stomach,
gas, distress after eating, and other stomach
disorders. As magnesia is prepared in vari-
ous ways, be certain to insist on obtaining if
from your chemist in the Salix form, espeei
ally recommended for stomach purposes.
Diggers at St. Dunstan’s.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WITH the signing of Peace, and the
sending forth into the world of
hundreds of blinded soldiers to
earn their bread once more, in most cases
much better equipped for the struggle of
life than before they were deprived of the
most precious of the senses, Sir Arthur Pear-
son’s task as head of the great institution in
Regent’s Park for the traiuing and educa-
tion of British and Dominion soldiers and
sailors who were blinded in the war, may-
be said to be nearing completion.
The work of attending to the blind victims
began at Bayswater in February, 1915, when
two Belgians were taken over to London for
training, and a in'" nth later the great enter-
prise moved into St. Dunstan’s, which was
from this time onwards to serve as the
throne-room of the Kingdom of the Blind.
Commencing with 16 patients, whose
blindness had been caused by bullet wounds,
the number rose by leaps when shrapnel and
.A shells be B’ an to get in their work, until
at the end of 1918, there were 1500 names
on the books—blind folk who had first of all
to learn how to be blind, and then to be
taught the best means of earning each a
living tor himself and his dependants.
Ordinary people, in whom the bump of
observation is microscopic, will tell you quite
seriously that Nature is very kind to the
poor blind nian, and that to make up for the
loss of vision she endows him with a pre-
ternatural of the other senses, par-
ticularly those of touch and hearing. There
is no truth in this asseveration; Nature is
too conservative and too hard a taskmistress
•L * , Once having given her precious
gitts she makes no provision for the loss of
them. She expects them to be safeguarded
with the utmost care. For this reason she
has protected the eyes by means of the eye-
*ms, and in addition has placed them out
of harm’s way deep in the bony cavities of
the orbit. The utmost that can be expected
when one sense has been lost is that, by
assiduous training and education of the
others, these latter may be brought to a
pitch of perfection hitherto undreamed of
by their possessor. People who can see
well are not compelled to educate the sense
of touch, for instance, to such an extreme
degree as the blind have to if they are to
better their condition at all. It is necessary
for them to finger for hours at a stretch the
embossed letters of the Braille type. For
those who are too dull to learn this type, or
who have lost their sight when past their
prime, the much-easier method invented by
Dr. Moon, and called after his name, is a
great boon. His alphabet consists of only
nine characters, and is so simple that a,
schoolchild or a man of 80 could learn it
in a week. All the St. Dunstaners, being
youthful, managed to learn the more diffi-
cult Braille without much trouble, some of
them at the finish of their training having
an uncanny proficiency in it, and being able
to read the type through two or "in some
cases four thicknesses of handkerchief. One
of the blind teachers never took off her thick
cotton gloves in winter while engaged in
reading, and experienced no difficulty in her
task.
It is only by educating the sense of hear-
ing- by. paying attention to the slightest
sounds in nature, that a blind man, after
much practice, can make this sense serve
the needs of his daily life. Blind people,
who have generally a natural desire to con-
ceal their infirmity from prying eyes, strain
their sense of hearing to the utmost, so as
to catch the slightest sound that may be
useful to them; for example, in coming to a
conclusion as to the disposition of the fur-
niture when entering a room to which they
are strangers. A clock ticking on a mantel-
piece would pass unregarded by the person
in full possession of his sight, but to the
blind man it would be a valuable indica-
tion, and close attention to such a trifle
might prevent him from making awkward
mistakes or perhaps meeting with a serious
accident. So an attentive study of the most
insignificant happenings in the daily round
becomes part and parcel of his existence,
and the one who pays the most attention
to trifles will the soonest acquire that in-
dependence which goes such a long way to
make a blind man contented with his" lot,
and without this content his condition in
the world is miserable indeed. This point
was gone over and over again at the Hostel
when the soldier, sometimes with a bad
grace, was learning to be blind. He dis-
covered that, although he might not have the
slightest perception of light, yet if a body,
such as the hand, were held suddenly in
front of his face, he was at once conscious
of the presence of some object. It is this
sense—which the blind attribute to the ex-
treme delicacy of the nerves of the
face —that enables them to walk about so
confidently in close proximity to a wall or
railing without having to be perpetually
engaged in feeling their way with then-
hand or a stick. A stick, as an aid to
locomotion, after a little practice in walk-
ing in the specially-constructed grounds of
the Hostel, was in nearly all cases finally
abandoned by the Australians, who were
conspicuously the most independent members
of the blind community, and soon got about
the extensive grounds with phenomenal
rapidity.
Although the rooms and corridors in the
Hostel were carpeted throughout, a special
track of linoleum was put down the centre,
and visitors were not allowed to take this
path. It was of use in teaching the blind
soldier his bearings; and in the grounds a
similar device was tried, the gravel walks
having netting over them; and where there
were steps a board sunk in the gravel both
at the top and bottom gave due warning of
danger, and at tne turns in the pathways
there were railings with round knobs in
order to give the promenaders confidence.
In a few weeks these aids to locomotion
were rejected with fine scorn, an* the blind
soldier wandered about the grounds at his
own sweet will. People who can see don’t
have to notice with the foot or hand any
slight irregularities in the surface of a kerb-
stone, pavement or iron or wood railing; but
to those deprived of sight the correct inter-
pretation of these apparently insignificant
trifles means much to their happiness. An
incident will make this point clear, and show
that to the blind there are very literally
sermons in stones. Sir Arthur Pearson was
walking near the Hostel in a dense fog, when
he was accosted by an army officer who had
lost his way and was vainly endeavoring to
find York Gate, which was quite near. Sir
Arthur said jokingly that he ought to come
and get treated at St. Dunstan’s. Without
telling him that he himself was totally blind,
he at once led the officer to the Gate. From
constantly being in this neighborhood, and
by paying the utmost attention to trifles,
he had got to know his bearings, and was
infinitely the better man of the two in a
London fog.
Another fallacy which has got hold of the
public imagination and needs correcting is
that a man who has lost his vision deterio-
rates mentally. A few weeks’ residence in
the Hostel would have removed this impres-
sion for good; for anyone who gave the
matter serious thought would soon see that
the blind man has to be constantly using
his intelligence even in the minor details
of existence. His wits are naturally sharp-
ened by the constant practice he gets, and,
after being educated at the Hostel, men
Avho in the pre-war days had never aspired
to jnore than 15s. per week as agricultural
laborers, when they had health and perfect
vision to aid them, were both anxious and
able to earn four or five times as much.
Others who were men of education before
they were afflicted were enabled, after a
rigorous training, to manage large busi-
ness concerns. In one case a blinded officer
was sent on a world-tour on important busi-
ness for his firm. It was found, too, that
teachers who were themselves blind were
more successful in dealing with those patients
who felt their position acutely and were in-
clined to be morbid. A few kindly words
of advice from these teachers made a won-
derful difference in their attention to studies
and acted as balm to their hurt minds.
Those patients who were desirous of earn-
ing their living at clerical work were, first of
all, taught to use the ordinary typewriter, and
when they had conquered that they were
initiated into the mysteries of Braille. One
would think that education would come to
a full stop here. But Sir Arthur was by
no means satisfied, so he got hold of a handy
machine by which, with a good deal of prac-
tice, his pupils could be taught to write
shorthand. The machine had six keys and a
spacer, and the characters were embossed
on a long strip of paper. When the pupil
wished to transfer his notes to the ordinary
typewriter, he put the paper through a piece
of wood about nine inches long, which con-
tained a central groove the width of the
strip. By this device he saved about. 25
p.c. of time. Telephone operating was
taught, of course, by the shutter method, and
some of the pupils became extraordinarily
adept. Some 60 blind soldiers who had
studied Braille, and were thus enabled to
read text-books on anatomy and physiology
conquered the difficulties of massage, and
before the end of the war were in active
practice at this useful profession, some of
them in military hospitals. Sir Robert
Jones, the great orthopaedist, was greatly
impressed with’ their intelligence and deli-
cate touch.
Next to reading, perhaps the greatest
pleasure of the blind soldier lay in his being
able to visualise present and past events.
It afforded him much delight to visualise
the color of the dress his lady companion
wore, or to guess at the color of her hair
or eyes, and he loved to interpret the
various sounds or noises met with in the
course of a walk or rowing excursion. His
adventures on the battlefields of I ranee
were a perpetual source of comfort to him,
and he could go over each day’s happenings
continually without any feeling of weariness
or sameness; and he will be able to put
such happenings to profitable use as long as
he lives.
OCULIST.
A Night Alarm.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
u A ND, Mr. Byles, during my absence
in Cairo, see that your respon-
*- sible duties of Orderly-Officer are
carried out conscientiously. (Where the
blazes is that groom with my horse?
Where is he, I say?) See that no wan-
dering or unauthorised Arabs approach the
camp ; keep a vigilant eye on the horse-lines;
inspect—(Ah! There you are, I see. Damme,
what do you mean by being 10 minutes late
with my horse? Don’t answer back, damyer.
It makes it worse. Hold the brute steady
— steady, I say.) As I was saying, Mr.
Byles, any neglect, any dereliction, however
slight, will be observed and punished. The
discipline of the unit is going to Hell, sir.”
Upon which the C.O. and his charger lum-
bered away over the evil-smelling sand in
the direction of civilisation, as represented
by Shepheard’s Grill Room and unlimited
alcohol.
The wretched Byles unstiffened, allowed
his right hand to fall limply to liis side, and
contemplated the' prospect. It was late
afternoon. “Stables” were over. Pay-day
having occurred recently, everyone was
either already out of camp or lurking fully
dressed in his tent waiting for the C.O.’s
departure to get out. A melancholy round
of idiotic ceremonies lay ahead of the young
man, assuming he performed them. He had
to inspect the men’s teas. The men didn’t
like it; he didn’t like it; and in any case
no notice was ever taken of their complaints
about the food. He had to turn out the
guard. During the process he was required
to simulate an acquaintance with the mech-
anism of their rifles which 'he did not
possess. With the assistance of his facto-
tum, the Orderly-Sergeant, he had to trans-
form himself for many weary hours into
a combination of an inspector of nuisances
and a policeman. His soul revolted at the
business—more especially as he had been
asked out to dinner that night himself. Still,
duty was duty. With a sigh he summoned
his henchman, got his handkerchief in
readiness, and approached the incinerator.
* * * *
It is past midnight. The camp is in dark-
ness. So much so that even the signal lights
over the C.O.’s tent have, as the result of
mad carelessness on the part of an underling,
been suffered to flicker out. It is understood
that the purpose of these lights is to guide
the leader over the illimitable desert in the
direction of his command however much ex-
traneous circumstances may have tended to
dim his sense of locality. But Byles, un-
aware of the calamity, has sought his couch,
and is asleep. The sentries are also asleep,
to a man. Byles is dreaming—a happy
dream of civilian life, of morning tea in bed,
and breakfast at 9.30; of freedom and a
total absence of insult. He is dragged back
to semi-consciousness by the leg. Literally
so, for the Orderly-Sergeant has hold of it.
“Get up, sir,” the man is saying. “At once
—fer Gor sake!”
“Get out of that. Leave my leg alone.
Why, it isn’t daylight yet.” Thus Byles,
fretfully, under the delusion that an attempt
is being made to beat Revally.
“It’s him, sir—the Colonel. He’s back.
Going on something chronic. Hedger let his
lights out and he’s bin lost. He come into
camp by the wrong way—-by the native
graveyard—and fell over the cookhouse
table. He’s arshin’ for yer.”
A serious position. Byles thrusts a leg
out and begins to draw on a chill, dank
gum-boot.
“Quicker, sir. He’s fairly roarin’ now.”
The harassed officer tumbles hurriedly out
into the darkness. The monstrous figure of
his chief is visible outlined against the now
lighted interior of his tent. Byles approaches
at a broken run, intended to suggest alert-
ness, devotion to duty and the soldierly
qualities generally.
“Hurry there, hurry, sir, damn you, when
you hear the order!”
The Colonel is clearly annoyed. Byles
halts at the regulation six paces, and salutes
in a manner intended to be ingratiating.
“And so, Mr. Byles, this is the manner in
which you carry out your orderly duties. I
return to camp to find it in a state of chaos.
By whose fault? By whose fault, I ash?
That is the matter which I now intend to
investigate. But before we go any further
be good enough to place your Orderly-Ser-
geant under arrest.”
“But, sir”
“‘But, sir— -tut, sir!’ Curse you, would
you mutiny? Obey the order —and if I don’l
break the man, break him and revert him
to the ranks where he belongs, may I never
wear the uniform of his Majesty (God bless
him!) again.”
“Sergeant,” said Byles feebly, “you’re
under arrest.”
“And now, Mr. Byles,” said the enraged
old warrior menacingly, “let us investigate
your own record. At what hour, if at all,
did you visit the stable picket?”
“At 10.40, sir, and found all correct.”
“You turned out the guard?”
“I did, sir, and read them their orders,
also inspected their rifles. On visiting the
sentries on their posts at 11.45 I found all
alert and acquainted with their different
duties.” Stout lying this, Byles having
turned in after a friendly cup of tea with
the sergeant of the guard at 10 p.m.; but
safe in the circumstances.
“Before we proceed further make a note
of this. The cook, and with him the whole
cookhouse staff, will be returned to the lines
to-morrow morning. A lot of lazy, dis-
orderly scoundrels —leaving tables about in
the dark. Damme, look at the state of my
shin!”
“Sergeant,” said Byles sternly, “make a
note that O’Flanagan and the others are to
go back to the lines at the first parade.”
“(food God in Heaven, have you no
brains? Is it with officers such as this that
I shall be called on to go into action? llow
the Devil do you think the men are to get
their breakfasts?”
“Sergeant,” said Byles, “leave O’Flanagan
alone for the present.”
“And now, sir, send me the Warrant-
Officer. If I don’t probe this thing to the
bottom—What the blazes are those men
doing looking out under the flaps of their
tents? Put your heads back there. At once,
Mr. Byles, go and take their names and have
them up before me at Orderly Room to-
morrow without fail. Every manjack,
damme. And then get the Warrant-Officer.”
Byles’s heart ached for the Warrant-
Officer. He had observed his condition in
the canteen hours before, and he knew his
man too well to hope that an improvement
had taken place. Gestures having been made
at the flaps of several tents designed to
create the impression that names were being
taken, Byles made for the sleeping-place of
the doomed N.C.O. The latter was sterto-
rously asleep with all his clothes on. Byles
worked hard on him. In vain. The Colonel’s
cries grew louder. lie now demanded the
Sergeant-Major as well, and to Byles’s know-
ledge the Sergeant-Major was in a worse
condition than his friend and drinking-com-
panion the W.O. There was a brief period
of respite, during which Byles—under in-
structions—put the Orderly-Corporal under
arrest, while the Colonel formally discharged
his batman, and informed him that hence-
forth he would begin his work as a sanitary
orderly at 6 a.m. sharp.
In the interval something happened to the
Warrant-Officer. The resonant music of the
Colonel’s voice pierced even his unconscious-
ness. Responsive to the call of his chief
he made a superhuman effort and burst out
of his tent. For the fraction of a second he
stood to attention in the light of the now-
rising moon : and then Nature asserted her-
self. He sank gently back like a swimmer
disappearing in a breaker and was seen no
more. Simultaneously the Sergeant-Major
crashed into the open, like some creature of
the jungle, fell heavily over a guy-rope, and
lay motionless.
The Colonel surveyed the scene with an
expression which, to Byles’s astonishment,
carried with it a hint of satisfaction.
“These,” he seemed to be saying to himself,
“are weaklings. Contrast them with my-
self. A few paltry lagers and they are
utterly undone. Whereas I, their leader,
after drinking bottle for bottle with the
strongest heads in Cairo, am a model of
sobriety.”
“Mr. Byles,” he said kindly, “I am glad
to say that you emerge from this inquiry
cleared —without a stain on your character
or honor. You have done your duty as an
officer and a gentleman should. Damme,
men have been given decorations for less.
Byles, my boy, I’m proud of you. Shake
hands. With regard to that Orderly-Ser-
geant. inform him that he is no longer under
arrest. Neither is the Corporal. Fine fel-
lows both, and men on whom I intend to
keep a paternal eye. Byles, a final night-
cap with me in my tent, and then—to bed.”
But Byles, unnerved by the night’s events,
was in no mood for conviviality. Putting
forward the unconvincing plea that he had
to find the Sergeant and Corporal and tell
them the good news, he hurried away.
The Colonel mixed himself a whisky and
soda. The Warrant-Officer hiccupped and
muttered uneasily in his sleep. The camp
slept once more.

The most noticeable theatrical matter in
Melbourne last Saturday was “Quinney’s,”
at the King’s; but owing partly—perhaps
mainly-—to the merit of the play, the house
was not as full as it should have been.
Lawfence Cecil, fresh from foreign parts,
made a pleasing first impression as Miggett,
the crafty young assistant to Joe Quinney,
ready to. go any. lengths in business to make
sure of annexing Joe’s daughter. The
character seems to have grown amiable since
an amateur filled it in an earlier production,
and the new member of the Tait co. made
it likeable, especially in the last act. Eily
Maly on was as- good as before in the mamma
Quinney part, whilst Elsie Burkes gave a
somewhat peachlike flavor to Miss Posy.
The all-important expert in furniture and
things, whose name is engraved on the
comedy’s brass plate, is supposed to be a
hearty north-country Englishman. Arthur
Sty an, of old. was a fairly realistic Quinney ;
Gregan McMahon gives an artistic repre-
sentation of an unhearty type of person.
The revival has run its four nights’ course,
and the King’s is now awaiting the advent
of Kate Howarde’s company in “ ’Possum
Paddock.” They start the Melbourne season
on Saturday.

“Lightnin’,” at Melbourne Royal, touches
its 12th week on Saturday. Criticism re-
tires backwards from the august presence of
a comedy-drama which lias reached the 12th
week of its reign.

Tomight (Thursday) is the last of
“Ivatinka” at Melbourne Majesty’s. Grand
Opera takes the stage on Saturday, when
Amy Castles, Wheatley, Loder, Leah Myers
and the rest will give “Butterfly” another
nutter., “Cavalleria” cum “Pagliacci” and
‘Faust” will help keep things humming next
week. “Trovatore” comes next on the list.
A few changes in “Buzz Buzz,” at Mel-
bourne Tivoli, came with the second edition
last: Saturday. Phil Smith, as a red-
whiskered hotel porter, had the assistance of
Hardinge and Nell Fleming in a more than
“ Buss-Buzz ,” at
Melbourne Tivoli.

The circus that
came to Melbourne
a fortnight ago is
preparing to reluct-
antly turn money
away during Cup
week, when the
widespread show at
Olympia will
breathe the very
spirit of the times,
as it were. In
other weeks people
go to th e airy
temple of the
varieties of Wirth
as a matter of
casual sight-seeing,
but the carnival
compels the multi-
tude' to roll up.
The entertainment that happens all over the
place to the persistent strains of a brass
band is then the right thing at the right
time, and the present assortment of events
in the arena, or in the neighborhood of the
roof, is very right indeed.
Hoyt’s, in Melbourne, screen Pauline Fre-
derick at both houses this week. Also the
well-beloved Theda Bara treads the “For-
bidden Path” at De Luxe matinees, and at
the Lyceum after the sun goes down. Elsie
Fergusson and Co. play “Eyes of the Soul”
at the De Luxe only, but at both houses the
bill measures about the same number of feet.
At the Majesic, in Flinders-street, the sins
of millinery stores are expounded in “Marie,
Ltd.,” Alice Brady figuring as the millinery
fiend's accomplice in their ancient scheme.

Qf a Cup-time picture-show
At the Fine Art Society’s Galleries in Melbourne
—they might be more briefly termed the Gill Gal-
leries —the name of Lindsay is associated with a
show which looks somewhat meagre in its spacious
setting'. Lionel has a display of 51 water-colors ai.d
a dozen etching's, including' four dry-points and three
pure aquatints. Roughly speaking, the well-spread
collection of water-colors is rather pleasing than
impressive, and, though none of the pictures would
be at all tiresome to live with, some are but trivial
works of art. Among many bits of Spain nothing is
more conventionally satisfactory than “The Cathedral
Close” (18), whereas “The River” (42), which may
be Spanish or otherwise, strikes one as having-
nothing in it that the most bilious observer could
admire or object to. “Blossoms” (48) is more am-
bitious. There is a woman in it, as well as a blos-
soming tree and other little matters, but she is an
unconvincing female compared with the melodramatic-
person, with mischief in her eye, who sits nursing
her countenance in “Caged Birds.” A bold and
lonely melodramatic figure is “The Picador” (39).
and a landscape with a real or imaginary charm in it
is “Evening Harmony” (27). The present commen-
tator fancies that the charm is real and would
improve on closer acquaintance, although the paint-
ing of the trees is smudgy. Strong evidence in favor
of the “charm” theory is offered by the aquatint
reproduction (64) of this same nocturne. It is a
sweet thing. Among the etchings “The Argyle Cut,”
“The Rocks” and “The Doctor’s House” are con-
spicuously appealing. The steps leading to the
Doctor’s door-hell may not seem quite right. When
one comes to think of it, there are many things in
many other people’s etchings which seem not quite
right. The main purpose of. an etching is to be
fetching, and Lionel Lindsay undoubtedly achieves it.
In Sydney this week the Mozart,
Beethoven and
Cesar F ranc k
sonatas poured out
the easy rhythm of
their themes with
Edward Goll and
Henri Verbrug-
glien as inter-
preters. Like some
broad and tranquil
stream the andante
movement of the
Mozart sonata
flowed, and the
presto movements
of the Kreutzer
were as sudden as
a Bolshevik bomb.
But the Cesa r
F ranc k sonata
sounded like an old
romance with a
thread of gentle
sadness running
through it, yet work-
ing itself out to a
snnuv ending.

“Old Lady 31” is due at Sydney Palace on
Saturday night, so “Daddies” will ride-a-
cock-horse for the last time on Friday.
Ten weeks gone and “Going Up” is still
going on at Sydney Majesty’s. Cheerful
songandance is the steadiest line of theatrical
■goods to deal in.
“The Sentimental Bloke” and his Doreen
flit across the screen at Sydney Royal twice
daily, and there are always plenty of people
present to see them in transit.
“The Officers’ Mess” continues to keep
Sydney Tivoli going. On Friday night Hugh
D. Mclntosh, M.L.C., is to present Tivoli
life-passes to N. S. Wales winners of the
V.C. The hero’s work isn’t done when he
has knocked out the enemy. Incidentally,
what happens if, in 15 years or so, the pre-
sent Tivoli becomes a meeting-house for Par-
ticular Baptists ? Is the ageing V.C- still
obliged to batter on the door and spend an
occasional evening in gloomy meditation?
Nazimova, at Sydney Crystal Palace and
Strand, lives for 17 years in a lighthouse
tower; but she is still sophisticated enough
to spot the first eligible who appears on the
skyline. Hurriedly doing the Grace Dar-
ling act, she catches and jugs her man. Un-
fortunately the girl has an uncle with a
dyspeptic temper towards lov-ers. He locks
the girl away in the tower, and when her
lover calls he is told that her headstone is
being carven. But are the two thwarted?
Not a thwart! The fascinating Kitty Gor-
don with the wonderful clothes has dropped
into the Lyceum with “Stolen Orders,” a
war story, wherein spies and secret service

are the principal properties, with a strong
support of bajUoons, seaplanes, battleships
and bombs. The overpowering Theda Du
Barrys at Piccadilly and Apollo. The
American lady has a quaint idea of how a
sparkling and witty woman “joshed” her
king in the days when a poor girl had to
depend on her looks and her coquetries to
earn an honest living. At Hoyt’s Lila Lee
shows her dimples in “The Secret Garden.”
and Sessile Hayakawa has “A Heart in
Pawn” and loses the ticket.
Adelaide wants to know why it lias gone
all these years without seeing “The Tales
of Hoffmann.” The Offenbach legacy has
been so keenly welcomed at sight that it had
to be played oftener than any of the old
favorites in the season at the Royal. Wheat-
ley and Errolle share the name part, Eileen
Castles and Gertrude Johnson the singing-
doll character. Full of action and melody,
the piece scores in spite of the weird Eng-
lish into which it has been rendered. Amy
Castles in “Butterfly” has won the other
honors. At the Majestic, the lady Sa Hera
causes much discussion, and thoughtfully
promises to keep her magic powers in check
to the extent of not revealing the “family
or personal matters” of a questioner unless
pressed too hard. Louis London is a brisk
and versatile singer, and the popularity of
Nellie Ivolle is unabated. Green is still the
prevailing hue at the Tivoli, where Conrad
Power and his Irish co. are replacing “Kil-
larney” by the well-tried “Colleen Bawn.”
At West’s, Alice Joyce outwits cleverer
people in a screen version of the old “Third
Degree.” Wondergraph has a girl who
wanted a short sentence so that she might
write about prison life, but ran against the
wrong Judge and got a long one. The Pav.
specialises in humor, with May Allison as
one Peggy, athletic and venturesome. So
does the Grand, with Madge Kennedy as a
Perfect Lady—with intervals for refresh-
ments.

“F.W.”: The death of 11. B. Irving re-
calls the night of his opening in Sydney in
“The Lyons Mail.” I was on the front at
the Criterion when a couple inquired if
there were any seats. I told them there
were none. “Oh, well,” said the lady as they
turned away, “it really doesn’t matte! 1 —

“C. Ockney”; Volatile Seymour Hicks, the
well-known English author-mummer, has
startled the 'theatrical world by suddenly
switching off froip the sock-and-buskin busi-
ness and taking on a conjuring stunt, a la
Cluing Ling Soo. From his earliest days
as a comedian the surprising Seymour, on
account of his habit of pinching other com-
edians’ gags, was known as “Steal More
Tricks.”. The chances are he won’t lose the
title in his new sphere.
“75” : Performers known to Australia who
are in “Eastward Ho,” put on at London
Alhambra at an alleged cost to Oswald Stoll
of £30,000, are Violet Loraine, one of the
best panto, “boys” there ever was; Andrew
Higgmson, of the peevish voice and pretty
smile; Ambrose Manning, who scored as the
trainer in the tirst production of “The
Whip” ; and Deeima and Eddie McLean, the
Australians who specialise in “whirlwind
dancing.”
C. J. He Garis ends this controversy :
Grant If. Harvey’s so-called facts (B. 16/10/’l9)
are, as usual, totally wrong. All fruit exported by
the A.H.F.A. for five years has realised higher prices
than have been charged in the Commonwealth, and
already for the coming season enticing offers from
overseas have been refused until we know that ample
quantities will be available for Australian require-
ments, which local requirements we are also trying
to stimulate and increase, although it would pay us
better to ship abroad. The A.D.F.A. claims to be an
industry which proves the practical advantage of
a Protective tarift' to a young country. In earlier
years it received benefit from the Protective tariff ■
then when opportunity arose it did not abuse its
power, nor was it ungrateful. It kept the country
which had protected it fully supplied with ample
quantities at much lower prices than it could have
got overseas. Surely a double triumph for Pro-
tection and a successful decentralisation of industrv.
Conroy of the Yap was a witness before
the N. S. Wales Wheat Commission last
week, and gave evidence about cheques that
he had drawn in favor of “cattle,” “sheep”
and other animals that rarely visit the pay-
ing teller. Conroy’s district seems to breed
that sort of payee. Very old hands at the
Bar still tell of Dr. Bell, an Irishman settled
on the Seymour Estate, in the Braidwood
district, in the days before tiie gold rush,
lie was a hard rider who had a quarrel
with a Mr. Huntley. When paying one
of his periodic visits to Sydney he mot
Huntley in the street and horsewhipped him.
The Court said it would cost him £lOO. I)r.
Bell produced his cheque-book and worded the
slip as follows: “Pay the Queen one hun-
dred pounds for thrashing old Huntley.”
The Law eyed the cheque and remarked that
Dr. Bell could be further charged with con-
tempt of court. But he wasn’t.
“Copabella”: The entrepreneur had been
a plumber, but had sunk the money made out
of leaky taps in the lease of a picture-house.
I found him admiring the effect of an Eng-
lish river-scene upon which he had pasted
name-strips of a film based on R. W.
Chambers’s “Hidden Children.” “Novel ver-
sion of the ‘Hidden Children’ you’re show-
ing,” I said. “Your own?” “Run outa
posters,” he explained ; “but this is Harold
Lockwood all right!” He pointed out the
star in the picture, dressed to kill in modern
yachting costume. “Folks might find fault.”
I said; “ ‘Hidden Children’ is an Indian
yarn of the 18th century!” For answer the
art-student went off to look up something.
“By snakes,” he said in an awed tone as
he returned, “so it is. Now that’s
awkward!” He scratched his head, then ho
turned to me again. “D’ya think anyone
else 11 have read the book?” he asked plain-
tively.
“Norbell” : There was nothing of the kerb-
stone comedian about Clarence Branscombe.
He was really funny when on, but as serious
as the cost of living when off. The show
graced by Clarence arrived in Newcastle for
a week’s season. Clarence had written in
advance for quiet board and lodging, and
had a postcard in his pocket from his pros-
pective landlady. Before seeking his new
home, however, Clarence went round to
Hunter-street with some of the boys and
was much refreshed. “Not pickled,” he ex-
plained, ‘on’y li’l’ bit sozzled.” Suitcase in
hand, he accosted a policeman. “ ’Scuse me,
consli’able.” he remarked ingratiatingly, “can
you direck —’scuse me!” Cautiously he de-
posited his suitcase on the pavement and
searched his pockets. “Ah ! Yash ri’!” Ho
Produced the. Postcard. “D’you know where
thish place is?” The policeman obliging]v
directed him, and Clarence picked up his
luggage and went his way. A week later,
at the conclusion of a successful season, Clar-
ence went to the theatre to receive his “trea-
sury,” and again he sampled a cocktail or
two with the boys. Then he packed his
theatre-basket, and set off home with his
suitcase to get his belongings from the board-
ing-house. But Clarence felt quite giddy,
and for the life of him couldn’t remember
the name of the street he lived in. “I know
’sh called ‘Hal’ somethin’—but hoi’ on!” He
approached a policeman, placed his suitcase
on the kerb, and produced a crumpled post-
card from his pocket. “ ’Scuse me, cou-
slis able, but can you direck me—there?” he
asked politely. The policeman took the card
like a man in a trance. “Great Scott!” he
gasped ; "haven’t you found the damn place
yet?

“Fax”: Whilst dashing Beatrice Miranda
is scoring successes as Madame Butterfly
and in parts more congenial to her hand-
some personality, another Melbourne girl,
Eda Bennie, is making her mark in the
same Carl Rosa Co. She is charming as
one of the heroines in “Tales of Hoffmann” —
the consumptive heroine in the last act.
Eda Bennie left Australia with the Quinlan
Opera Co., whereas Beatrice Miranda had
gone to England some years previously and
joined the other co. when it was struggling
after the loss of its founder. The 50-year-
old enterprise is nowadays managed by Mrs.
Rosa and Alfred Van Noorden. The de-
cease of the man who made the label
famous was, by the way, the subject of a
rather rough gag. In one of the J.C.W.
pantos, a man used to pop up in a side-box
and sing a verse. The man on the stage
who had invited the mock-amateur effort
used to say satirically, “You ought to be
with Carl Rosa.” Whereupon the bogus
butt would say, “But Carl Rosa’s dead!"
and of course the other fellow replied ‘‘Quite
so,” or words to that effect.
; “Struck Oil,” in which Maggie
Moore and H. R. Roberts are starring in an
Australian-made film-version, has a romantic
story. Not long before J. C. Williamson
left California to try his luck in Australia
lie was introduced to one Sam Smith, an old
miner. This ancient had “made up” some
plays which Williamson read. One, “The
Dead, or Five Years After,” J.C.W. bought.
He got his friend Clay Greene to re-write
the piece, but the result didn’t satisfy the
actor-manager on rehearsal, and he got busy
on it himself. His version, re-named “Struck
Oil,” was first played in Salt Lake City,
next in San Francisco and then in Australia.
The J.C.W.-Maggie Moore season opened
with the piece in the Royal, Melbourne, in
1874.
"O. Guff”: The J. C. Williamson people
are fairly entitled to wax ironical over the
absurdity of the Melbourne musical critic
wlio compared Verbrugghen’s bringing of 60
orchestral musicians from Sydney to Mel-
bourne with Napoleon’s crossing of the Alps.
“How about the transfer of the panto com-
pany, with complete scenic outfit, from Syd-
ney to Maoriland?” asks the J.C.W. pub-
licity man. Also Wirths might mention that
the matter-of-course tours of the circus are
somewhat more Napoleonic than the invasion
of Victoria by Verbrugghen’s forces, laden
only with kitbags and the instruments they
blow or scrape.
The brothers Majeroni. sons of the Italian
couple who made Australia their home and
a big reputation in it, are alive and well iu
America, according to word received from
Nancye Stewart. Previously they had been
reported dead. Both are clever performers ;
hut after breaking away from the Firm they
had some rough experiences. One of their
last in Australia was a disastrous season
of semi-classical drama in Brisbane. The
brothers then mobilised “The Kelly Gang,”
and got enough to make an escape.
“G. Elburg”: The Firm might take a
tip from the boom business done in Perth
by amateur operatic societies. Following
upon its success with “The Mikado,” the
Perth Operatic Society crowded His
Majesty’s for a week with “San Toy.”
Reginald Kenneth (now coaxing the shy
wheat plant in the West) had played Bobbie
Preston for 200 nights in London, and helped
the amateurs materially on and off the
stage. Although his voice must be written
of in the past tense, he has forgotten nothing
of his business. Mrs. Hope Robertson was
admirable in the name-part, Mrs. Moran
very good as Dudley the maid, and the least
satisfactory of the principals did not for-
feit his (or her) right to live to play
another day. The chorus was more than
creditable, and the staging up to professional
standard.
The Beecham Co. has been giving London
a revival of Bizet’s Scotch opera, “The Fair
Maid of Perth,” now half a century old. Its
chief claim to notice is that the composer,
finding it did not attract, frugally used its
ballet-music again for “Carmen” a few years
later.
“Aisle Seat” : Add to the list of the Turf’s
alliances with the Stage M.L.’s crack jockey
Ashley Reid. He married Vera
Kearns, serio and daughter of
Jack Kearns, who, with partner
McKisson, was a panto, com-
edian in the days of Violet Var-
ley, and now sticks hard and
fast in Sydney vaudeville. Reid
recently rode the winners of all
the flat races at the Wanganui and Timaru
meetings.
“Old Pot”: Charlie Sylvester, who was
taught conjuring by his more famous father,
was the floor manager at the old Crystal
Palace Rink, in York-street, Sydney, in the
late ’eighties, and one of the instructors was
Bert Bailey, the comedian. Bailey learned
to skate at the Ashfield Rink in the days
when he was tapping a telegraph instrument
as a minor Government official.
“Norbell” : The announcement that Robert
Courtneidge may visit Australia next year
reminds me that I last saw him here at the
Lyceum (Sydney) in 1894 or so. He was the
comic servant in an elaborate production
of “Round the World in 60 Days,” brought
down-to-date from Jules Verne’s yarn. Sass
and Henrietta Watson played leads, and
Harry Leston and D’Orsay Ogden were pro-
minent in the cast. Don Juan Caciedo, the
wonderful top-boot wire-balancer, also ran.
Courtneidge disguised his part in a Harry
Lauder accent, and as a Scotchman wearing
a Japanese costume he warbled an Irish ditty
in a Tokio street scene !
“Dale” Charlie Ivenningham, the former
J.C.W. tenor, who has struck hard times
at Maryborough, is the son of a baker at
Sheffield (Eng.). A chorister in the
Cathedral, he sang at a musical festival at
which Sullivan was present. The composer
was so struck by the boy’s voice and
appearance that he repeated Gregory’s re-
mark anent Angles and Angels and made
the lad his protege. Subsequently he
appeared in all the productions at the Savoy,
and then drifted to Australia.
"THE SENTIMENTAL BLOKE." AT
SYDNEY ROYAL.
Ginger Mick (Gilbert Emory), the Bloke
(Arthur Tauchert), and Doreen (Lottie
Lyell), in the Australian photo play.
Lillah McCarthy has been heavily hit by
the failure of her attempt at single-handed
managership at the Kingsway, London. The
public would not have Arnold Bennett’s
gloomy Scriptural “Judith,” and, when she
made a sudden change to light comedy, Eden
Phillpotts’ “St. George and the Dragons,”
it unaccountably fell just as flat. So she
simply had to close the theatre.
“C. Ockney”: 11.8., the last of the
Irvings, who passed out the other day, was
not a great actor. His brother Lawrence,
w’ho predeceased him, was more effective, and
even he was never in the first flight. Both
brothers were more interesting as writers.
Lawrence was responsible for a dozen plays,
and H.B.’s books on criminology will be
read when his Hamlet is forgotten.
“T. D. Emdee” : H. B. Irving followed his
father’s model, but, although he reproduced
his “business” faithfully, the brain which
created it was not there, and the perform-
ance suffered. This was specially noticeable
in “The Bells,” where the Burgomaster is
counting out the gold of the murdered Jew
for his daughter’s dowry. Old-man Irving
made the audience feel that he felt the rope
about his neck as he threw the twine from
the bag round his throat and then drew it
tight. H.B.’s best work was in “The Lyons
Mail,” and, strange to say, he impressed most
in the straight rather than in the character
portion of the double. He had not seen his
father play “Hamlet,” so he told me when
he presented me with the acting edition of
the tragedy which he had used as a prompt
copy. His melancholy Dane was severely
criticised in Sydney, and “Some Thoughts
on Hamlet.” the lecture which he delivered
at the invitation of the Chancellor of Syd-
ney University on July 18, 1911, was really
a reply to his critics.
“Bloggs”: Hugh D. Mclntosh is offering
six girls £lO a week each to star on the
Tivoli circuit. No previous experience is
required: in fact, professionals are. to all
intents and purposes, barred. What an
argument it is for a theatrical union! In
no other calling could unskilled labor push
in to the detriment of those who have spent
laborious years learning their business. If
this putting of a premium on incompetence,
for advertising purposes, becomes general,
there will be but one course open to the
young women who can merely sing, dance
and act—to get out of the profession
altogether.
“1.L.C.”: “0.K.” in a recent par spoke
of the possibility of Patti’s sister Carlotta
having been the made singer of press boost
and friendly piffle. She was. She visited
Australia and was a frost—scores of local
students could run rings round her. Poor
girl! she was a cripple and hobbled abor t
with a stick. The late Leon Caron com-
posed a Patti Waltz . and dedicated it to
Carlotta—actuated by the gallantry of his
race rather than admiration of the singer’s
work.
“Petramos” : Aren’t we inclined to sneer at
Yankee plays when we should be scoffing at
Australian managers for making such miser-
able selectionsV Our big managers have evi-
dently settled in their own minds that the
only dramatic wares we want from America
are the crook, the sexy and the sloppy.
Yankee managers are gamer. They've trans-
planted “The Lost Leader,” which gives a
faithful picture of Charles Stewart Parnell,
and their George Arliss has a big reputation
as Disraeli. Further, they’ve had Mrs. Fiske
as Madame Sand, Henry Miller as Moliere
and Tom Wise as Mr. Barnum. Other Yankee
plays featuring celebrities include “Hamil-
ton,” “Paganini” and “Abraham Lincoln.”
I offer the suggestion to our Australian play-
wrights and managers. Leave “The Hay-
backs of ’Possum Selection” alone and put
old Henry Parkes into a drama.
“Biobox” : Though Australian film-produc-
ing is in its infancy we have at least two
movie veterans. Charles Yilliers, who does
Mercutio in “The Sentimental Bloke.” has
played leading roles irf 35 Australian-made
pictures. David Edelstein is probably next
on the list, with Lottie Lyell (Doreen) head-
ing the heroines and vamps. Villiers was in
“The Message of the Spear” when the blacks
who had been rounded up at Bourke got
together in the middle of the picture’s making
and went on strike for better money and
more ’bacca. They were receiving 2s. 6d.
per day and they held the producer up fol-
ds. and got. it. Edelstein is a real veteran,
70 years old. He was for many years in the
Vic. C.1.D., and carries round with him a
sovereign, one of a bulk consignment pinched
in Melbourne from the I*, and 0. Co., and
recovered by him and others.
“Buttinski”: Beaumont Smith goes to
America in December with the idea of work-
ing out some picture ideas, and getting back
into other branches of the show business.
He has the movie rights of all Henry Law-
son’s stories and of Banjo Paterson’s “Man
from Snowy River,” but he is-determined
not to turn them into celluloid until he has
garnered the experience of producing which
Uncle Sam offers.
“Ike Pagliacci”: A Sydney Opera House
audience complacently watched a perfectly-
virtuous heroine set on fire the other evening.
Leslie Adrien, in “When London Sleeps,”
found her draperies ablaze after a distressing
experience with the villain (Beckett), who
had manacled her to a stage furnace. The
hero (Conway), waiting his cue to rescue
her, didn’t observe the lady’s predicament,
and the audience thought it was additional
realism. When things became desperate the
fireman off-stage overcame his modesty, made
his bow to the public, and saved the heroine
just as she had begun to burn briskly. Miss
Adrien didn’t set hysterics, but she finished
the scene in a dead faint.
Significant of the difference between
British and Australian theatrical conditions
is the announcement that Henry Arthur
Jones, in leasing “Silver King” rights to a
touring manager, stipulated that the drama
shall not be played more than twice nightly.
Time was when H. A. Jones, at the height
of his boom as a writer of “high life”
comedies, spoke disrespectfully of his youth-
ful connection with the “dull devil of melo-
drama.” But the melodrama he wrote in
partnership with long-late Henry I-Jermau
has grown in value, whilst all his iater plays,
except, perhaps, “The Liars,” are fading-
out of memory. The cinematograph rights
alone in “Silver King” must have become
a fine property.
“T.D.E.”: H. B. Irving had a few words
to say while in Sydney about Ivyd’s “Ham-
let.’ which “Harrison O” mentioned lately.
11.8. thought Shakspeare founded his ver-
sion upon Ivyd’s. “How much of the First
Quarto is Shakspeare’s own work; how
much of it is merely the text of the old
play; how far it is perhaps nothing more
than an imperfect shorthand note of Shaks-
peare’s completed play—these,” he said, “are
questions the critics are unable to deter-
mine.”
THE HERO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“General Harbord, chief of the American Mission,
was shot twice at Kars, but was not injured.”
— S. M. Herald.
The General smiled grimly as he faced the whiskered
odds
Of Bolsheviks who touched him up with vicious
bayonet prods,
And through his chewing-gum he snarled: “See here,
you goldurn Rubes,
If I had a ten-cent snickersnee I’d chop ye inter
cubes!
“Get wise, you pin-head guys, an 'quit this dime-
museum stuff,
Or Uncle Siam will get some peeved an’ call yore
gardam bluff!”
(It’s really not recorded just exactly ivhat was said,
But Doughboy heroes speak like that in novels I
have read.)
But little recked the Bolshies any hot-air Yankee
threats,
They shrieked: “Well outski him at once just like
the damski Letts!”
(At least that’s what they meant to say, but when
they talk at Kars
It sounds like moujik droshky, Nevsky Prospect
samovars.)
They seized the gallant general and tied him to a
tree,
Then raised the dread cry “Vodka!” and commenced
a jamboree;
The Red Guards trained Lee-Metfords on the martyr
posing there,
Whilst the blackguards inharmoniously intoned a
Bolshie air.
They shot him twice. He never flinched ; undaunted
was his mien.
He said: “This fillum oughter make some riot on
the screen!”
They loosed his bonds. lie said “By-bye!” His
auto honked away.
He’d done his stunt as hero for a Keystone photo-
play.

Tivoli Theatre on a salary of £lO 'a week.”
“My face is my fortune, sir,” she said;
“At a tenner a week it’s absurdly cheap.”
The Boss replied, as he shook his head,
“At rotten conclusions you tyros leap.
“Your facial beauty’s beside the point;
In a manner of speaking, the question it begs.

DEAN’S DILEMMA, and HOW HE OVERCAME IT.
ACT I—Scene: A Country Town.
Messrs. Dean, Amps and See met are discovered sitting in Mr. Dean's office.
MR. DEAN: “Gentlemen, I sent for you as
I wished to consult you on a matter of
much importance to myself. The death
of my late partner, Browning, has thrown our
affairs into some confusion. We carry a large
stock, as you see. But you will recognise that
in a business such as this it takes time to
realise. I had not the slightest idea
in the world that the Probate Duties
were so heavy. Between the State
and Federal Death Duties his estate
is called upon to find no less than
£lO,OOO. And, unfortunately, there
was no life policy in the estate. Up
to a few weeks before his death—
you both knew him well—he was
in excellent health, and a policy on
his life could have been readily
obtained. Indeed he spoke of it
uv? (
O (UU
p
w
more than once. You may remember, Mr. Amps, that only a few
months ago you quoted the rate of premium to him for a policy of
£10,000; it amounted to only £2 70 a year, and Dr. Smith said he would
give him a certificate for twice £10,000 if he wanted it. Only for this
unfortunate outbreak of ’flu he might have lived to 100.
The trouble is now to realise this probate duty without dislocating
our general business. Of course, his Executors might realise some-
thing on his home, and sell those Gas Company shares, but even then
there will be a very big shortage.
‘Ah, well! There is nothing fo it I suppose but the sale of the
partnership, and goodness knows w'no the next man will be. There
were not many like dear old Browning.
“However, I am determined taat in my own case this sort of
thing shall not recur. I want to effect a policy on my life for £20,000,
so I sent for you two as representing the two Australian Mutual Life
Offices whose contracts seem to me to be most acceptable to the
assuring public. I have not quite made up my mind as to which of
the two offices I shall do business with.’’
AMPS: “How can you have the slightest difficulty, Mr. Dean?
1 here is only one Life Office in the Commonwealth to do business
with: the Australian Mutual Provident Society. Life Assurance and the
A.M.P. Society are, as you know, all over Australia synonymous terms.
To even think of any other office is too ridiculous for words. Ha! Ha!”
Annp^
SEEMEL: "I say Ha! Ha! too. Amps
has got into the habit of talking this way.
Been in the business for nearly a quarter
of a century; he thinks that things are
moving along in the old nineteenth century
style. There are none so blind, Mr. Dean,
as those that don’t want to see. Personally,
1 have the greatest respect for the old
Mutual. My orders from my office are to
always speak respectfully of the Pioneer of
Australian Life Assurance. All I can say is
that if you give the City Mutual Life your
business—mind you, we are more than
usually particular in the selection of our
lives; an irate agent of ours the other day
wrote ‘that it was easier for a camel to
pass through the eye of a needle than for an
applicant for a life policy to get a first-class
certificate from our Medical Director, Dr.
Jarvie Hood’—you will, I am sure, have no occasion to be dissatisfied.”
DEAN: “I understand, Mr. Seemel, that your limit on any one life
is £10,000? Well, that is some\yhat awkward. I wanted cover for
£20,000 at least.”
SEEMEL: “Yes, £10,000 is the limit we hold, Mr. Dean. But
we will readily is.sue you a policy up to £50,000, if you wish. And we
-should esteem it an honor and a privilege to re-assure with the Society
Mr. Amps so worthily represents (bowing to Mr. Amps), up to the
extent of his limit. It might, however, be interesting to compare the
results cf the two offices, and I would suggest that you give the
A.M.P. Society £10,000 and give us the other £10,000.”
DEAN: “Gentlemen, will you kindly step across the road with
me, and I will see my Banker, Mr. Biggs, on the matter. I must do
something soon. There is no time like the present in life assurance.”
ACT II — Scene: Bank Manager’s Office.
DEAN: “Good morning, Mr.
Biggs. You are a busy man, so
I will get to the point at once.
I intend assuring my life for
probate purposes. I am not
quite sure which of our two
friends here will give me the
better contract, the A.M.P.
Society or the City Mutual.”
BIGGS: “No occasion to
ask, Mr. Dean, when there is
only one Life Assurance Office
in Australia worth a second
thought. The grand old A.M.P.
I am assured in it. My father
held a policy with it, and my
grandfather was one of the
foundation members. What
d>
m
was good enough for them is quite good enough for me, and should
surely be good enough for you, my friend.”
SEEMEL: One moment, Mr. Biggs. Your grandfather drove a
pony shay in the good old days. You, now, use a motor-car. What
was good enough for him should surely be good enough for you! Your
father wrote his own letters in long hand when he was your age. You
have the services of a stenographer, and you use a type machine. So
that, apparently, what was good enough for your father doesn’t seem
to be good enough to suit you. Why not move with the times in Life
Assurance also?”
BIGGS: “That is an entirely different matter.”
SEEMEL: “It is not a different matter, with great respect, Mr.
Biggs. Your father and grandfather had a policy with Mr. Amps’s
Company, for the very good reason that at that time there was no
choice. There was no other office but the A.M.P. Society. 1 am not
questioning the antiquity of my friend Amps’s office. I am quite
prepared to learn that Captain Cook had a
policy in the Company, if that is any argument.
What I say is, that if Mr. Dean is proposing to
effect a policy in this year of grace 1919, he
is, as a keen business man, surely entitled to
look round and see where he can get the best
investment.”
BIGGS: "Quite so. Quite so—er —er —
what did you say was the name of your
Company? The City Mutual—City Mutual!
Never heard of it.”
SEEMEL: "And you a Banker! The
City Mutual Life Office is now in its fortieth
year. It is one of the World’s Millionaire Life
Offices. Its bonuses are the largest in the
British Empire. The conditions embodied in
its policies are of so generous a nature that
they evoked from the late Actuary of Mr. |
Amps s own Company (Mr. David Carment,
r) R l
F.I.A.), on the occasion of a Conference of International Actuaries, held
in Europe a few years back, the laudatory expression of opinion, that
they were extraordinary liberal provisions.’ It has an annual income
of over a third of a million, and its progress could have been infinitely
greater from the viewpoint of funds were it not for the policy of its
management which has been to deliberately restrict the business so as
to assure only the most select lives. This partly explains the City
Mutual’s wonderful bonus results.’
AMPS: “Pooh! Seemel is a pastmaster in the art of throwing
bouquets at his Company. Why, the City Mutual’s total resources are
under two millions, while those of my Company (expanding his chest)
are over forty millions, Sir.”
SEEMEL: Quite so. But don’t forget that the liabilities of the
A.M.P. Society run into over a hundred millions sterling, whilst ours
are about six millions. Size of funds is nothing. So far as size of funds
is concerned, there are three Amer : can institutions whose funds aggre-
gate over three hundred millions of money. Nothing—if you say it
quickly but a lot all the same. Yet the bonuses they pay their policy-
holders fall far short of those paid by the A.M.P. Society, let alone my
own Office.”
BIGGS: Now, Mr. Seemel, listen to me for a moment. You don’t
mean to deliberately tell me, Sir, that the results of your Society, the
er —the City Mutual, compare in any degree with the bonuses paid
by the great old Mutual Provident?*’
SEEMEL: “Better, Sir! Infinitely better.”
BIGGS: Perhaps so during the past couple of years. When the
A.M.P. Society lost so heavily at the war, your bonuses for a time,
might have been bigger, but going over a period of ten years, for instance,
your bonuses are not to be compared with those of the A.M.P. Society.”
SEEMEL: “So far as the war was concerned, let me tell you, Mr.
Biggs, that the City Mutual has been hit just as hard proportionately, if
not harder, than the Australian Mutual Provident Society, and our
bonuses, if you want to go back for a period of ten years, I am quite
sure will compare more than satisfactorily with those of Mr. Amps’s
Company.”
‘But surely, there must be a difference in the rates of premium
paid by the assured. Do you mean to ell me that on a fair comparison, taking
an exactly similar class of policy, your Tociety has paid during the past ten years
larger bonuses than the A.M.P. Society? I am not prepared to believe you,
Sir without some evidence.”
SEEMEL: ‘‘Very well. You are a Banker. Money talks. I’ll tell you
what I will do. Your hospital wants funds. All hospitals do. I will under-
take to pay £500 to the hospital funds of this town, if on comparison of any
two policies, for £1000 each, issued f r r the whole term of life, at first-class
rates, the bonuses paid by the City Mu ual during the past ten years are not at
least £50 bigger than those paid by th< A.M.P. Society. If I am correct you
will pay £100 ( to the funds.”
BIGGS: “Well, you ooen my eyes. Sir. Now say a policy issued by your
e?n™ y at , age ’ What would be the premium in your Company for
£1000, provided your doctor gave me a first-class pass?”
® ur ra^-e would be £27 15s. Od. per thousand.”
BIGGS: ‘And what would the A.M.P. Society charge for a policy of £1000
on a first-class life at. that age?”
SEEMEL: “The difference is only rivial—£27 13s. 4d. Practically the
same premium, as you will see.”
BIGGS: “Well, I understand our agreement is that we are to send to
Headquarters for an authoritative report on the bonuses paid on a policy of this
nature for the past ten years. That if 7 our bonuses are greater than those of
the A.M.P. Society, I am to forfeit £1<~0 to the hospital funds. I will not hold
you to your somewhat foolish boast t.h t your office has paid bonuses £50 larger
than those of the A.M.P. Society—-thai was said hastily—but, if your bonuses
are less than those paid by the A.M.P. Society for the
period in question, you will forfeit £500 to the
much-needed funds of our local hospital.”
SEEMEL: “Agreed.”

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
The coming Melbourne Cup will, unless
half a dozen of them go amiss before the day, offer
a wider field for discussion than last year’s event,
wherein light-weighted Night Watch met and beat
Kennaquhair at a difference of 331 b. This time the
difference between them is only 101 b.: last years
winner carries an extra 281 b. as against 51b. on the
brawnier back of the runner-up. Night Watch s
burden will call for the remarkable improvement he
has made in the meantime. That is, if Kennaquhair
can regain liis apparently lost form. The question
as to whether Brad field’s Caulfield Cup trio were at
their verv best the other Saturday is specially in-
teresting in the matter of Chrome, for Chrome (who’
seems sound enough to keep going) must have gone
faster than anything in the last quarter-mile. lie
gained ground on the two leaders, and on that
showing would be preferable to either of them over
the two miles if their relative conditions remain
unchanged. Chrome and Artilleryman look first
picks of the Victorian horses at, time of writing,
but the stamina of the three-vear-old has to be
further tested in the Derby ere his Clip prospects
can be fairly estimated.
In the Derby, too, Richmond Main and Surveyor,
one or other of them, will need to show Cup form
or be snuffed out. No two high-dlass colts could
be much more different than these. The Main is
a large, imposing fellow who might be a four-
year-old, he is so well grown. The Maorilander, on
the other hand, is rather light and dandified, and
high on the leg. Yet ho might stay as well as
Sasanoff; did after running only third in the Caul-
field Cup. Surveyor, however, gets 91b. more to
carry in the Melbourne Cup than Sasanoff had, so
his fourth at Caulfield doesn’t allow him a com-
paratively favorable chance on paper. Still, the
fact remains that he gave Richmond Main 21b. and
finished ahead of him in Lucknow’s Cup. On that
running the writer prefers Surveyor to Richmond
Main for both Derby and Melbourne Cup, but it
seems hardly reasonable to prefer him to Artillery;
man, who won Caulfield Guineas brilliantly.
Who can judge the Melbourne Cup chance
of Kenilford by his second to Rebus in the Metro-
politan? lie will have 61b. off his back, which
means much in the last quarter of a two-mile race.
But Rebus, when giving him a lot of weight at
Randwick, appeared to outstay him. Kenilford’s
stamina, is still questionable, whereas lan Or has
won. a Sydney Cup, and would seem very kindly
handicapped if he were not meeting his old oppo-
nent Night Watch at a disadvantage, considering
how Night Watch (Bst. 21b.) has improved in com-
parison with the aged horse who carried only 6st.
101 b. in the Sydney Cup. Their respective weights
at Flemington will be Bst. 91b. and 7st. 131 b. All
things considered lan Or must be counted out. He
might get a place, for sometimes the leaders are
very strung out at the finish of a Melbourne Cup.
But he can hardly be expected to win.
Ard-na-ree’s chance is open to the same question
of inter-State form as Kenilford’s. He has run from
poor to middling on two recent occasions in Mel-
bourne, but at the finish of the Caulfield Cup he
appeared to be running on, and bis breed suggests
stamina. British Arch is another light-weighted
Sydney horse among the possibles, and, with the
recommendation of having won the 14-furlong
Waverley Handicap from end to end, his pretensions
to finish in the front rank next Tuesday are un-
deniable. But they can’t all win. And C«Tb<"" ! i
is expected by bis people to finish ahead of such ns
British Arch.
As for Lucknow, the Caulfield Cup winner,
although there is no saying how good he may be,
it is certain that he has not had anything like an
old-fashioned preparation for a long race, and that
his 101 b. penalty will make for tiredness in the
last half-mile. All going well with Lucknow up to
the day, it will be reasonable to back him on
account of his quality, in spite of his 9st. But
it will be just as reasonable to expect this year’s
Cup to be won by something carrying less than
Sst. On hard going the pace is likely to be ex-
ceptionally fast, and a muddy track will be even
more favorable to the light weights.
So many ifs, doubts, assumptions and question-
able theories enter into even a reasonable considera-
tion of a number of Melbourne Cup chances that the
man who tries to name the winner in one can be
excused for not going into details concerning those
he cloesnt fancy, lor two or three reasons, which
are quite likely to be falsified hereafter, the writer
prefers Artilleryman to all the other candidates,
whilst admitting that the colt must be a very good
one if he is to beat the Caulfield Cup three and
Ivenilforcl, not to mention the other possibles. Artil-
leryman may miss the Derby, of course, in which
case he will look not so good as these remarks
assume him to be, but the Cup prospects of the
actual Derby winner will be not the less bright.
Any one of three others who might win the
Derby—-Surveyor, Milliemc or Richmond Main —would
look then a likely’ thing for the double event, and it
is on the cards that Millieme, an alleged great stayer,
might win the Cup after losing the Derby, despite
his 7st. 71b. But these remarks can’t wait for tne
result of Saturday’s classic race, and in the mean-
time the writer’s leaning towards Artilleryman is
due to the belief that this consistent performer has
improved considerably since he dead-heated with
“Baron” Brown’s colt at Randwick.
In addition to the Derby there is the Melbourne
Stakes, also the Hotham Handicap, to which punters
can look for guidance on the first day of the
V.R.C. meeting. If Night Watch is to remain favorite
for tlie Cup he will have to be one of the first
three in the Stakes, and if the Caulfield Cup form
is to retain its reputation Eusebius, Sir Ibex, Luck-
now and Chrome will need to make a good show
against the visiting cracks in whatever races they
go for.
Stadium Referee
JOE WALLIS rests
between rounds.
If Night Watch and Kennaquhair are
both in the field next Tuesday it will be the first
time in ever so many years that the starters for
a Melbourne Cup have included the winner and
runner-up of the pre\ ious year. The winner of one
year has been second the next (Lord Cardigan, for
instance), and the second horse (Carbine and The
Grafter) has won at the second time of asking.
Westbrook filled second and first places, with a
year’s interval be. ween the runs, and Malvolio and
Comedy King ran twice unplaced after winning.
But-in no case since the very early days of the Cu >
have the first two nags in one evert boon started again
the following year. The old original Cup winner
(Archer, in 1861) won it in 1862 also, and Mormon
finished second on each occasion. But that’s a long
time back. The Gup crowd was then estimated at
4000 ; the 16 starters included only two horses and
a three-year-old colt (the elder gentlemen being
Archer and Mormon aforesaid), the rest of the runners
being mares or geldings. Three of the mares fell
at the turn for home, and two of them died in
consequence of the mishap.
Suburban racing started again in Sydney
on Saturday at Moorefield. the’ so-called punters’
paradise. Not one favorite arrived ( ’ring the day,
sevens, lo’s, 12’s and 10’s being on tap about the
first four winners. A couple of sisters, Dornoch and
Tressfoil, by Tressady—Quatrefoil, took a race
apiece, and the ancient La. Steppe, oi ee a queen
among suburban sprinters, broke a prolonged record
of late arrivals by winning the Flying.

When he accepted the Chief Justiceship
Adrian Knox handed over to Colin Stephen, his
brother-in-law and successor as chairman of the
A.J.C., a Popinjay colt bred by himself with hopes,
perhaps, of the Derby that never came his way. On
Saturday this descendant of the best nag the C.J.
ever had, streaked away from the other young'uns
and registered the first, win for tlie Popinjay family.
The opposition was a very ordinary lot, though.
Stephen has been addicted to racing all his life,
one of the best he ever owned in the past being
Elmo.
That useful mare Dribble (All Black —
Float) landed the Wainui Handicap for W. Rich-
mond at the recent Wellington (M.L.) Spring Meet-
ing. Tigritiva, another lady by the same successful
sire, took the Shorts Handican (six furlongs) in
lmin. 11 4-ssec., carrying 7st. 101 b., which is equal
to Charmilla’s time put up at Riccarton (M.L.) in
1914. Kilboyne’s lmin. lOsec. achieved at the same
place last year is the record.
T. Lyons lias a promising colt in Ker-
manuka (Kerman, imp.—Arewaka), winner of the
Trial Handicap at Elwick (Tas.) on Saturday and
half-brother to his Melbourne Cup candidate Prince
Moeraki.
*** - w
The third round of Sydney grade cricket
started on Saturday. The wickets mostly favored
the bowlers. One exception, however, was at Hamp-
den Oval, where Gordon met Paddington. Diamond
put Noble’s lot in on a pitch which, to the surprise
of all, proved slow and easy. Result: 260 for
eight. Achurc’n batted stodgily for 81, and Wells
opened his shoulders for 10 less. Gordon’s fielding
was superb. Glebe v. Sydney (Glebe 91 and none
for 10, and Sydney 143) was characterised by feeble
batting and Asher’s bowling. He got six Glebe men
for 47. Middle Harbor (120) gave a miserable
display against West’s bowlers Robinson (4 for 45)
and Single (3 for 40). The only bat to shine
was Scott (56). Wests have lost five for 168 (K. B.
Docker 86). Scott got 3 for 54. Balmain (157)
look like going down to Norths (3 for 126). Hogue,
4 for 27, might well have had an earlier trial.
McElhone, for Norths, made 60 faultlessly. Yates
scored 52 out of Uni.’s total of 148 v. Waverlev.
“Wally” Pite got 5 for 43 on a tricky wicket.
The reputedly strong Cemeterian batting side were
all at sea. and could only amass 75 (Trenerry, 5
for 28). C. Cumberland (150) got it at Petersham
from the home team (276)* Sid Thomas (44) anil
Fitzgibbon (38) for C.C. stopped the “rot” for
which G. Thatcher w’as responsible. Smith (Peter-
sham) made a chanceless 136.
* * * *
O. S. Smith, who made 136 for Petersham
v. C.C., hit eight sixes during the effort. He plays
in specs., and keeps in form as sportsmaster of
North Sydney High School.
* * * *
The Australian Board of Control’s an-
nual meeting at Melbourne decided to guarantee
the exes of an M.C.C. team in 1920-21. An Aus-
tralian XI will follow the tourists back in 1921.
IL Bushby (Tas.) will be chairman for the ensuing
12 months; and Syd Smith (N.S.W.) keeps the
position of secretary and treasurer.
* * * *
The only century of last week’s Melbourne
District cricket was scored by Richardson for Rich-
mond v. ’Cote. He gave hardly a chance in making
104 out of a total of 174. Two of ’Cote’s wickets
are down for 103. In the ’Wood v. ’Don game a
just-returned man, Stewart, “came off” remarkably
with the ball. Six for s"> was his tally. ’Wood s
total for eight wickets is 173. Easts‘could only
amass 97 against Melb. The destroyers were John-
ston and Ironmonger. Melb. is 120 for five. Pons-
ford and Cohen went in first for Saints ( v. Souths)
and made respectively 94 and 91. The score stands
at six for 215. Uni made 204 against Norths (May
71), and Pra’n hit up 160 v. Carlton, which has, so
far, lost no wickets for six.
* * * *
In the cycle traders’ recent 100-mile road-
race, Don Kirkham, from scratch, won by half a
mile in shrs. 32min. llsec. He and 10 of the first
1 4 riders used Dunlop tyres.
* * * *
There was another poor house at Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night when Jack Green met
Frankie Dailey, of America. Dailey, like the rest
of the Yanks, is game; but as Green is eaually so
and in addition is a clever little boxer and strong,
the bout was painfully one-sided. At the end of
20 rounds Dailey had not a solitary session to his
credit.
* * * *
Some ancients of the boxing world fore-
gathered at Cessnoek (N.S.W.) last week, when
Billy McNabb, who used to fight as a welter at Syd-
ney Stadium in the past, was licked by Jim Baillie,
a local middleweight. Bob Whitelaw, of pre-Stadium
days, immediately challenged the winner, and so
did Bill Squires.
An Australian is once more champion
sculler of the world, Alt Felton having easily beaten
Ernest Barry on the historic Thames course on
Monday. The ex-Digger was eight lengths ahead
at the three-mile post and was pulling up by six
lengths. Jim Paddon, champion of Australia, who
was beaten by Barry on the Thames in 1914 in
21min. 28sec. (4min. 12 sec. better than Felton’s
time), will no doubt be the new man’s first opponent
on this side.
Perfect weather and a crowd of 150.000
adorned the 13th Henley-on-Yarra Regatta last Satur-
day. There was not a dull moment from the time
the first gun went at 12.45 p.m. till the final struggle.
The most interesting win of the day was that of
Nagambie senior eight in the Grand Challenge Cup
from North Esk (Tas.) and ’Varsity. The big
brown farmers included Heath (stroke) and Gatlin
No. 7. a pair in the “ziff” class, who brought a boat
to Melbourne years ago and defeated Charlie Donald
and the mighty Chamley in the Senior Pairs. Bar-
ton (Richmond) won the Sculls rather easily from
Bradley (North Esk) and Westbrook (Derwent), both
Tassy scullers, l’avks captured both the maiden
eights and the maiden fours—by half a forward can-
vas in the eights, covering the mile in smin. 12sec..
and the fours by a length in very slow time. To
win the maiden eights some 17 crews had to be
disposed of. In the Stewards’ Challenge Cup, the
event for senior fours, a South Aus. crew from
Murray Bridge beat Hawthorn and Essendon all tlie
way in smin. 35sec. Only Mercs,, Essendon and
Corio Bay faced the starter in the junior fours and
the boats passed Hie judges in that order, with
Mercs, a good three-quarter length to the good. The
regatta attracted five crews from other States, in-
cluding a senior eight from Leichhardt (Sydney),
which fell a victim to the superior form of North
Esk (Tas.) in the first heat of the Grand Challenge.
A crew from the Torrens shed (Adelaide) went
under to Murray Bridge in the third heat of the
senior fours. In the first heat of the junior
eights Mercs. No. 2 crew (actually the Scotch
College head-of-the-river eight.) fouled at the Botanic
Bridge and ceased rowing. The rest persevered,
Service winning from Mercs No. 1. Service had to
re-row against the fouled Scotchmen, and the job
was too big. Then the Scotch youngsters met a
solid bunch of bank-clerks in the final and were
themselves donkey-licked by nearly two lengths in
smin. Bsec. Little Johnny Lang, who has hitherto
been responsible for the stage-management of the
carnival, handed over control this year to IV. S.
Philip.
West Wallsend and Balmain Fernleigh
(Sydney) strove for the Kerr Cup (Soccer) at New-
castle on Saturday, and at the end of the regulation
time had kicked a goal apiece. Extra time each
way was played, but the scores remained level. .So
after 24 hours’ solid going the battle was adjourned.
Either South Aus. tennis is weak just now,
or Melbourne Uni. is particularly strong. In doubles
Adelaide ’Varsity more than held its own, but in
singles McKay beat Gurner and G. M. Hone in
turn, and Mclnnes beat Rowe and P. R. Hone.
Melbourne won by 12 rubbers to 9. The Adelaide
intercollegiate match went to St. Peter’s —10 rubbers
to Prince’s 5.
* * * *
G. S. Down, back from the war with a
major’s rank, and settling in Sydney, is the con-
sistent cricketer who played for S. Aus. for several
years before the war, and was in the running for
still higher-class play.
* * * *
There is a bit of a boxing boom in Perth,
though the quality of the bash is not very high.
Stone, who talks volubly off stage in the American
language, is the chief performer at present. Matched
lately against Hickling, a local welter, the Kangaroo-
hopper won all the way, the Westralian turning it
up at the end of the eighth round, with his smelling
apparatus broken.
* * * *
The well-known trainer Mark Thompson
went west last week from his home, Cerise and Blue,
Randwick. After a career as a successful jockey, he
began training in the early ’eighties, his first
notable success being with Humphrey Oxenham’s
mare Cerise and Blue, winner of the Sydney Cup.
'He was highly successful as a trainer, and in late
years raced in partnership with James Barnes, of
Tatt.’s Club. A straight young sport was Mark
Thompson.
* * * *
The push-bike is “coming” again in Adel-
aide. A handicap race to Noarlunga, 20 miles
out, was won (by half a wheel) by William Dale,
sec. of the S. A. League. He started from the
limit mark (19min.) with his own son, but lost
him on Tapley’s hill. Dale’s machine was locally
built in 1913. He himself is an 1869 model.
* * * *
An English amateur of no great repute,
J. C. White, captain of the Somerset XI, has made
a sensation by taking 16 wickets (for 83) in one
day. Of course there was a lot of luck in the
chance of opponents happening to follow-on. The
feat has been equalled in first-class cricket only by
Emmett and Southerton half a century back, and by
Wass and the late Colin Blythe 10 years ago.
Apparently it has never been matched by an Aus-
tralian. Blythe’s bag was 17 for 48. White took
seven more in another county match next afternoon,
making 23 in two days—certainly a record.
* * * *
“H.”: The hero of this yarn is now a well*
known fielder in the paddock at Randwick. He and
his mate bought Peach Melba at Chisholm’s for half
a hundred, and found they had got a decent mare.
The standing order to the boy on top was, “Until
we tell you otherwise, you’re dead.” They had run
Peach Melba at every meeting, from Bourke to Cowra,
and the Cowra Cup was their object. Peach Melba
was never better in her life than when they saddled
her up for the race. The senior partner then got
busy in the ring, and from 20’s Peach Melba came
to twos. After a sensational finish she was pipped
on; the post. The owner’s rage was only excelled
by the anger of the boy on top, who, before ho un-
mounted in the cage, growled: “Look here, the next
time you want me to ride this mare I’m going to
win. She nearly pulled my arms out!” The senior
partner had done everything but tell the pilot to
win !
“Jim Carew” : What is the expert’s real
objection to Australian-minted pennies for playing
two-up with? I have never yet struck a well-
organised “school” where they were used, and some
academies go to a lot of trouble to provide a supply
of English pennies. Those with Queen Vic.’s head
seem to be first favorites. Many men refuse to bet
at all where Australian pennies are “spun.” By
the way, what is the record for headin’ cm? At
a school in Egypt, just before we went into the
desert, I saw a Light Horseman head ’em 17 times
in succession.
“Tim” : I vouch for this. It was the occa-
sion of the yearly race-meeting in a certain Queens-
land sugar town. There was the usual hand totalisa-
tor, the “machine” consisting of a few pine boards
placed on upturned boxes, thus forming a sort of
counter. At the back was another board on wljich
was tacked the tickets of each starter in bunches of
50. Over the whole structure an ordinary camping
tent was spread for shelter, and the entrance to the
tent was in the opposite direction to the course. I
was having a bad “trot” tip to the fourth race when
Dingo Tom accosted me. “Here, I’ll get yer a
winner. Give us a quid,” said he. After the race
he brought me back £9. I then gave him another
pound, and after the fifth race he handed me £ll. “I
s’pect yer about square now. 1 want the last on me
own,” said Dingo. 1 was curious to know what the
game was, so I watched him as he hung around the
tote. After the winner had passed the post in the
last race—there was no bell to indicate “they’re off”
—Dingo dived into the tent. “Ten on No. 4.” He
got them, too. The two assistants were quite oblivi-
ous that the race was over.
* * * *
Racegoers are wondering whether the train
service this Cup meeting will permit of wearied
punters making an earlier escape than in the past.
The rule with the Vic. railways is to imprison all
ticket-holders within the precincts of the course
until the last race, excepting those who get away
by one special train immediately after the fourth
event. The other Saturday, people who didn’t leave
the course at 4.20 found that the next train would
not start till 5.10. The arrogant Department had
got them to Flemington, charging them an extor-
tionate price for the journey, and there they were
bound to stop till the rush came. The strange
thing is that the V.R.C. doesn’t apparently take any
interest in the matter.
* * * *
Richmond claims to be the only munici-
pality in Vic. which has a boys’ gymnasium pro-
vided by the ratepayers. The lads are taught to
box and wrestle, and occasionally give exhibitions
in other towns. Good resolutions are then generally
made by the other towns to follow Richmond’s lead,
but they never seem to get any further.
THE CUP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Artilleryman, so bright and quick,
So stout of heart, so sound and slick,
Artilleryman will do the trick
At Flemington next Tuesday,
When all the world has come to stare —
The johnnies and the girlies fair,
The country folk with cash to spare,
.And talk of Horse infects the air:
The Gentiles’ and the Jews’ day,
When tips are breathed in willing ears,
And warnings are received with jeers;
When hopes run high, whilst doubts and fears
Young punters have no time for;
The good, the bad, the blind, the lame.
E’en hawk-eyed sharpers at the game,
Their individual views proclaim,
And sometimes shout a gee-gee’s name
No bard could find a rhyme for.
“Well, what will win ?” the question vain,
The question quite absurd, insane,
Is asked again and yet again,
Yet no one grows the wiser.
Well, what will win? Who won the war
A year agone, when, red with gore,
The tidings flashed from shore to shore,
And all men knew the wide world o er,
The downfall of the Kaiser ?
Artilleryman, who served the gun,
Who saved Verdun, and got the Hun
At last upon that fateful run
Towards the pit of Topbet:
Artilleryman, the three-year-old,
Formed in the finest gee-gee mould,
Whose Musket blood runs never cold —
Artilleryman, the fleet and bold,
Will win. Thus saitli the prophet.
VICTORIA.

It is natural for you to be healthy—but you cannot retain
your natural, healthy state unless you aid Nature by keep-

In your daily habits there are certain groups of internal
muscles which you scarcely ever use. Nature intended you
to Use them or they would not be there.
Unless you DO use them they’ll wither and become useless.
They then cannot perform their natural functions —you will
then have a chronic feeling of weariness and lack of energy

IF FOOD DISAGREES, DRINK HOT
WATER.
When food lies like lead in the stomach
and you have that uncomfortable, distended
feeling, it is because of insufficient blood
supply to the stomach, combined with acid
and food fermentation. In such cases try
the plan now followed in many hospitals and
advised by eminent specialists of taking half
a teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia in half
a glass of water as hot as you can comfort-
ably drink it. The hot water draws the
blood to the stomach, and the bisurated mag-
nesia. as any physician or chemist can tell
you, instantly neutralises the acid and stops
the food fermentation. Try this simple
plan and you will be astonished at the im-
mediate feeling of i*elief and comfort that
always follows the restoration of the normal
process of digestion. Soldiers at the front
and travellers who are frequently obliged to
take hasty meals poorly prepared should
always take two or three five-grain tablets
of bisurated magnesia after meals to prevent
fermentation and neutralise the acid. — Advt.

Lieut-General Monash and his wife
lunched with George and Mary one day.
The meal was supposed to be altogether
simple and informal, and probably it was
quite bohemian from a royal point of view.
There were only two servants behind each
diner’s chair and a sort of major-general
flunkey over all. The King dismissed his
food-squad after each course was served, and
got a lot of enjoyment out of ringing a
little gold bell whenever he wanted the next
supply of food brought in. The army marched
in and out with great pomp. The party in-
cluded, besides the King and Queen and the
Australian guests, Prince Albert and Prin-
cess Mary. The guests were “received” in
a small Oriental room in the palace, and
the Queen and Princess Mary came in, quite
homely-like, without their hats. (It appears
that formality demands that royal ladies
receive ordinary guests in their hats.) At
coffee time Queen Mary smoked a cigarette—
presumably to show she is no wowser. Then
she took the Monash dame back to the Orien-
tal room and showed her jewelled swords,
lamps and other treasures that had be-
longed to “her father-in-law,” as she called
the late Edward. There were some wonder-
ful ivories also, the collection of. Victoria.
Each servant sported war ribbons and minia-
ture medals. None of the men had less than
half a dozen decorations. The King has
none but service men in his employ.
Windsor Castle is, however, capable of
quite the domestic touch. That Hon. John
Fortescue, the “official historian,” who has
made (so the cables say) a furious attack
upon Lord French, resides at Windsor,
where he has custody of the precious docu-
ments and vast collection of art treasures.
The Hon. John has written many books on
many things. “He is so extraordinarily ver-
satile and so wonderfully clever,” a lady-
in-waiting confided to a visitor lately. “Do
you know, he even makes his wife’s hats!”
Is it possible that George R. also makes
Mary’s? It would account for many things.
At Ivillyleagh Castle, Co. Down, Ireland,
there passed out lately, at the great age of
99, Mrs. Rowan Hamilton, grandmother of
Lady Helen Munro Ferguson, and bead of
five generations. To the end of her life she
was mentally alert, and hardly any crisis
could arise of which she could not say she
had lived through a very similar one.
She was not only conversant with what was
occurring in Great Britain and Ireland, but
through correspondence with her daughters,
Lady Duft'erin and Lady Carnoek, and her
grand-daughters, Lady Plunket and Lady
Helen Munro Ferguson, was well informed
about affaii’s in almost all parts of the world.
Ivillyleagh Castle is one of the oldest in-
habited Anglo-Norman castles in Ireland,
having been built by Sir John de Courci in
the reign of King John.
Knox, C.J., made an excellent impression
upon taking the oath of office. For a man
with so strong a jaw his evident nervous-
ness was quite an attractive feature. “He s
no mere icicle!” was the appreciative ver-
dict.
All the lawyers are talking admiringly of
the dignity and fine feeling shown by '’Aus-
tralia’s Noblest Son” at the swearing-in
of the new Chief. The wigs agree that
whatever Edmund Barton’s personal views
on the matter of this appointment may be,
they were not betrayed by so much as the
flicker of an eyelid. In striking contrast
were the piping congratulations of little
Attorney-General Groom. The old lions of
Federation listened stolidly.
It was rumored in the lobbies that Hughes
and Watt got to loggerheads last week. Per-
haps the forafer’s alleged, or threatened, or
promised support of Jensen’s candidature
had something to do with it. But it’s slx-li!
At the University reception to returned
soldiers and sailors Lady Helen was gor-
geously gowned in black, scarlet and purple.
Lieut.-Governor Irvine was dog-collared with
decorations above his spruce evening dress,
and his dame wore a marvellous cloak. The
heavyweights were all massed on the plat-
form, with the organ pouring selections down
their necks; and there were songs at in-
tervals. John Grice made a long speech of
welcome, the G.-G. and L.-G. Irvine each
had a turn, and two Y.C.’s said thanks. The
guests stood like tired cab-horses all through
the speeches. A colored fountain in the
centre of the hall gurgled and bubbled so
distractingly that Grice grew nervous, for-
got his lines twice, and then abruptly
ordered the water to be turned off.
Prof. Wallace, in khaki, spoke in a rich
Aberdeen accent while the colored lights
made his spectacles gleam blood-red. Dr.
Barrett wore his palest tropical uniform.
Dr. Crivelli’s son was there —he went away
at the very beginning of the war. Bluff
Admiral Grant was in mess dress, with his
waistcoat buttoned tightly across his gener-
out waist-line. Commander Hare was a slim
contrast. Dr. Scantlebury, a University
woman who did big things in Bananaland
and later at the war, came in a sort of khaki
fancy-dress. Ex-Mayor Hennessy brought a
jet-draped wife and a chiffony daughtex - .
Speaker Mackey’s atti-active wife favoi’ed
tulle hung by narrow jet straps. Mrs.
Cabena sat on the platform, defying the
draughts with a big Dutch-blue scarf.
There has been a lot of cabling between
the G.-G. and the Governor of the Apple
Island. The G.-G. wants his brother cocked
hat over for the races, but the Tasmanian
Excellency, having just completed a holiday,
had to obtain permission from England for
a further jaunt. Leave has been granted,
so over he comes. It is an arduous job, this
governing.
The Governor of Newfoundland and his
niece (she is Miss Dean) have been staying
at Government House in Hobart, and will
cross to Melbourne for the races.
The G.-G. and Lady Helen have invited
the Arts and Crafts people to hold their
annual exh bition in the ballroom at Govern-
ment House this year. There will be a brave
show of furniture, afternoon demonstrations
and tea. The G.-G. intends to uixveil his
collection of Australian w T oods.
The Gaud Mayor-elect started his festi-
vities by way of expressing his sense of
gratitude. Brother Councillors who voted
for him at the demi-semi-seci’et ballot were
invited to a thanksgiving dinner, with
theati-e party to follow. So the city fathers
are now formally divided into two camps—
the ones who did and the others who didn’t.
Agent-General Mcßride, who has come to
have his appointment extended or ended,
has been lunched at Federal Government
House by the’ G.-G. and at State Parlia-
ment House by Vic. Ministers. He was
treated as a “distinguished visitor” by the
Leg. Assembly and given a chair beside the
Speaker. He is less weighty than when he
went away nearly seven yeai-s ago, but his
cigai-s are as large and well-selected as ever.
Byron Moore, up to date, is here presented
by Lafayette. The fact that the V.R.C.
secretary diffei’s from all other racing club
secs, in the manner of his association with
sport is such a well-known raet that it may
almost be called historic. Tn June, 1881 —
the date being
exactly 18 centuries
older than his present
age—M r. Byr o n
Moore was appointed
to succeed his late
friend Mr. Bagot.
The new secretary
knew nothing of rac-
ing, and had only
once in his life been
on u racecourse. The
Cup Week receipts
were then £15,000,
and they are now
£50,000. The Club
then gave away
£lO.OOO a year in
added money : now it
is £70,000 a year.
Under the business
management of the versatile identity with
the patriarchal beard Flemington racecourse
in November has come to be the great sport-
ing and social rendezvous of Australasia.
And during those 38 years Byron Moore has
never made a bet.
One thing about the Bachelors’ Ball was
the way the old ladies were looked after. The
aged and the middle-aged were courted as-
siduously by diplomatic bachelors, and had
first call on the sumptuous supper tables,
which were decorated with pink roses in
bronze baskets. Also they were asked for
dances until they renewed their youth in a
whirl of three-steps. One very old-fashioned
three-step—it goes half a century back —is
the newest craze, so the girls needed no coach-
ing. The matrons were delighted also over
the fact that, though the champagne and
whisky were never so plentiful, none of the
bacheiors drank. Well, hardly any.
The frocks were lovely. Mrs. Lieut.-
Col. Riggall (her husband is in the limelight
over the McPherson case) wore a jade-green
dream. Mrs. Leslie Stuart, in a gown of
pink and silver flecked with cerise ostrich
feathers, and cerise silk shoes, chaperoned
two lucky girls. One was Fifi Irvine,
whose father is a doctor in Westralia. * She
is a Muriel Window type, with mopped
golden hair. The other was Mrs. Doolette s
little sister, Edna Weeks, from Adelaide.
Mrs. Stuart soon had their programmes filled,
then complacently danced till four in the
morning. The young widow of Nor-
man Hodges (she was a Mt. Schank Clarke
girl) was in w r ine color, with a wine-color
wreath in her hair. Mrs. Harold Newbigin
w r as a dream of bronze from hair to shoes.
The 50 bachelor hosts were marked for re-
ference by blue bachelor buttons in their coat-
lapels. They made the dance an event of
the season.
Geoffrey Strachan distinguished himself at
the Bachelors’ Ball by conducting, the or-
chestra while the leader cooled his brow,
waving a bouquet with one hand and the
baton with the other.
Padre Devine, pictured here, has just got
his war-book ready—drawings and maps by
Daryl Lindsay. The Padre, by the way, is
retaliating by supply-
ing some letterpress
for Daryl Lindsay’s
“D igger 800 k.”
The best part
of the expe r i-
ences of a clerical
dare-devil is set
down in “The Story
of a Battalion.” The
dedication and the
profits go to “those
who lived in this
book—the men of my
Brigade.” Out of
the Line, the Padre
devoted himself to
stiff reading of mili-
tary law', and he
made court-martials
a hobby. The book
was written in Belgium after the Armis-
tice, and is published in Australia by Mel-
ville, Mullen and Slade.
History may repeat itself. While Gillott
was Lord Mayor he was made first an hono-
rary Minister and then given a salaried port-
folio. Aikman, M.L.C., who is to start Gaud-
Mayoring on November 10, is mentioned as
an eligible for the vacancy for lion. Minister
in the Lawson team.
State Attorney-General Arthur Robinson
and his wife are going to England on a pri-
vate visit in January. While in London the
Minister will attend to some mysterious rite
called loan conversion. His brother is
in the thick of the London financial stew,
and naturally will help him to score a suc-
cess. Norman Bayles may visit London
about the same time.
Mrs. Norman Brookes, returning from
U.S.A. with her tennis-playing husband, has
had to break her journey at Auckland to
obtain a divorce from her appendix on the
ground of repeated acts of impropriety. In
her spare time the lady is an authoress, with
several books to her credit.
Over at the Oriental this week are ex-
Senator Norman Ewing and his wife. He
now dispenses justice in the Apple Isle, but
lias just been asked to inquire into the N.T.
muddle on behalf of the Federal Govern-
ment. Ilis wife was a daughter -of Chief
Justice Stone, of W.A.
Dan Seaton and brother Tom are about
town. Mrs. Dan and the daughter follow
next week. Dan is the owner of the gallop-
ing machine known as Wolaroi.
The W. L. Baillieus have booked their
dance for after the Cup. The social calen-
dar was so choked that they have pushed
their party back to the first Tuesday after
the last race.
Captain Claude Cumberlege’s wife and
small daughter arrive from England dur-
ing race-time. They will be the guests of
the Leslie Stuarts at Logan House, Toorak.
Captain Bogle, Y.C., will also be of the
house-party.
_ Madge Blake, a dainty little American
niece of the Miller clan, had a farewell
dance at the Oriental on Friday night. They
cleared the winter garden for the jazz.,
Mrs. Tom Murdoch, an Apple Islander
who is usually conspicuous at Melbourne
Cup gaieties, has to scratch for all engage-
ments this season. A sort .of ’flu-fever has
kept her to her room. Tom Murdoch has to
dine at Government House and attend
functions on his own.
Adelaide screens the week:—
The University is rejoicing in a gift of £15,000
from the sons and daughters of the late John Dar-
ling. The money is for a new medical school,
which is to bear John the Miller’s name.
The Navy League held a Trafalgar Day meeting
at the Town Hall, with the Governor in the chair,
and Sowden, Commander Bracegirdle and Attorney-
General Barwell as the other speakers. But it was
whipping a tired horse, and the affair had no snap.
Mrs. Seager, founder and secretary of the Cheer-Up
Society, has returned from a visit to Moorook witli
a plea for the wives of soldiers who have been
“settled on the land” there, and a warm tribute
to their pluck and industry. “The family di g-
outs,” she says, “are at most three little rooms,
with, in a few instances, a sort of verandah at
the back.” Most of the women are city-bred, quite
unused to country life, and most of them have three
or four children—some as many as seven or eight.
Mrs. Seager’s suggestion is that a wide front veran-
dah should be added to each cottage, and she’s going-
after the funds.
Orchestra and opera have apparently tired the
available listeners, for the attendance at the last
local Conservatorium concert was not good.
Harry Butler, the flier who worked for the Peace
Loan, has Set up in the aerial transport business,
and advertises a booking-office in Ilindley-street for
“aerial passenger fligilts.”
The agitation for children’s playgrounds i? show-
ing results. The Unley Corporation has decided to
establish one in what we think is a crowded area—
Leicester-street, Parkside. The lopal mayor, who
was one of the prime movers in the scheme, has
put down his own cheque for £5O. It is largely
owing to him that the site was not used for a
refuse destructor.
The Governor proposed the toast “St. Peter's
Fighting Men” at the St. Peter’s Old Collegians’
dinner. The Chief Justice was in the chair and
there was a record attendance of members.
The Howard-Schomburgk wedding is to be this
month, with relations only as the guests, owing to
the recent death of the bridegroom's father.
There was widespread sorrow on Thursday after-
noon when it was known that Mrs. 15. Barr Smith
had died that morning. Her rare personality left
its mark on all who had the privilege of knowing
her, and her sympathy was as quick and ready as
it was lasting and sincere. The extent of her per-
sonal and public generosity will never be fully known,
and more than one S. Australian who has achieved
success owes almost everything to her encourage-
ment and practical help.
The first step towards the long-talked-of removal
of Government House from the 'middle of Adelaide
sec-ms likely to be taken on the motion of the
returned soldiers. The Premier has given an un-
expectedly encouraging answer to a deputation which
asked for a slice of the grounds. It is the south-
eastern corner, on North Terrace, and could be
detached without spoiling the Governor’s residence.
But the whole block, on the finest site in the city,
has attracted so many longing eyes that future
Governors are likely to be given a home further out.
A. H. Ashbolt, Tasmania’s new Agent-
General, is a widower who has become en-
gaged for a second matrimonial venture.
The girl in the ease is Muriel Walker,
the travelled daughter of Cecil Walker.
The Camerons are relatives. The wedding
is to happen soon and was to have been
the biggest celebration that Hobart could
manage. However, grandmother Walker
died last week, so the plans have been modi-
fied.
Ethel Bishop, the Adelaide girl who won
and gave back the travelling scholarship
money to Melbourne National Gallery, is to
be married to Hector Paterson as soon as
the boat on which he is travelling reaches
port. A recent paragraph had them already
married : also, it called Hector Paterson ‘‘a
Scot,” when he is an Australian and proud
of it.
Marion .Tones, the Bendigo girl who goes
away in March under the terms of the
Travelling Scholarship which she won in
1917, is at present admiring Sydney Harbor
and inspecting the Blue Mountains. A tire-
less worker, she had decided to leave all
painting material behind her for this holiday
with her father; but she was persuaded to
take a few pictures across for exhibition,
and Sydney gazers can see them in Hor-
derns’ gallery. Lady Helen has asked her
to call when she gets to London, so the old
grey city already begins to look less like
a fortress to be stormed.
The Australian Artists’ Association plied
president -Edward Officer with food and ora-
tory at the Cafe Frangais recently. No’
man Macgeorge did his best to make the
guest’s cheeks like one of his own sunsets,
and Officer himself said the adequate thing
on the subject of “Soldier Artists.” Among
the toasts was that of “New South Wales
Artists,” appreciation being expressed of the
readiness of the Ma State’s brush-brother-
hood to give facilities for exhibits from the
other side of the Murray.
A committee is at work arranging a com-
plimentary concert for contralto Dorothy
Murdoch with the object of helping her on
the way to musical Europe. November 14
is the date.
The Americans are evolving new trips and
stumbles to vary the monotony of the jazz.
Jennie Brenan and her sister, who were in
the U.S.A. last year, are rushing to board the
Niagara this trip, to pick up the new ideas.
Their return passages are already hooked, so
that they may deliver the dancing goods next
March.
The Purple Cross intends to carry on into
civilian life, and working horses, as well as
any other animals needing help, will get the
benefit of the organisation. One idea the
Purple Cross cherishes is to have country
rest paddocks for the horses of poor city
people—hawkers and such like.

Blue sashes, red sashes, white dresses and
coats. Thousands of them bloomed on the
Cricket Ground on the Wednesday that was
Kiddies’ Day. There were maypoles with
say ribbons, and tiny tots stepping out the
old-time out-of-door dance. Suddenly the sea
of white flung up a tidal wave of color
when, at the director’s signal, the flags of
the Allies were thrown free to the breeze.
Then there was the dove —a live, palpitating
dove of Australian childhood that breasted
the barrier formed by the human lettering
■‘Victory.” It was an afternoon of thrills
for the grown-ups and another happy day
in the kiddies’ calendar. Dame Margaret,
with Daphne and Diana and the gentle
cutlet, were among those who applauded;
and Major Reddish was the man with the
whistle that shrilled its directions to the
human alphabet and feathers.
One understood wherein lay the old-time
popularity of the Paddington Town Hall
when Sydney Grammar hung out its black-
aud-yellow signal to ‘‘on with the dance.”
The old, old custom of sitting out on the
stairs had been rediscovered with enthusiasm
by Young Australia, and that particular hall
is built with a right and a left flight leading
to it. Billows of tulle, sleekness of satin
and softness of ninons, it sat upon the
steps with its attendant squire, while father
and mother and chaperone had the first help-
ing of the supper. Headmaster Sloman
kept the ball rolling till the small hours, for
the tickets had unashamedly proclaimed
dancing till 2.30; and that’s something like
a dance!
The Millions Club, which is, strictly
speaking, not a club at all but a persistent
restaurant-luncher, had its most sacred pro-
vince at Sargent’s invaded by womannood
last week. It brought the deluge on itself
by inviting mere females to speak on “What
Women Want.” One girl, blithely ascend-
ing in the lift, confided that she had made
a list, starting with a limousine and sitting
down for a rest at a bijou cottage on the
South Coast; but she wore near-sillc stock-
ings, and was plainly a sheep among the
goats.. Cookery-bookish Mrs. Aronson started
off with a strong word in favor of compul-
sory cookery-lessons in the school. Dr.
Grace Boelke gave the host the first punch
below the belt when she demanded equal op-
portunities for women; and she had a few
vitriolic examples of sex-injustice right in
our midst to hand out to the meh in return
for their “guest” card. Mona Daley, check-
skirted and panama-hatted, had an edge on
her plea for the bachelor girl. Miss Snelson
implored us to give the girls a chance by
handing over to the Y Worry-Collect Again
institution £50,000 in one week, so that for
a moderate sum a girl might be housed and
fed- But the truth is with Grace Boelke.
Give girls and young women the same pay
as you give young men, and the hostel be-
comes the sign of a barbaric time.
His Ex. had another heart attack last
week, and his and Lady Davidson’s move-
ments are in consequence;uncertain.
Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Eliot have left Gov-
ernment House. They expect to return to
the Islands this week.
Lieut. Wally Marks should suit Went-
worth, the. Federal seat which Willie Kelly
has held since 1903. Pie is affluent, being
one of the big family which contains Her-
bert and Theo Marks, Mrs. Bowker, Mrs.
Bred Watson and many other brothers,
cousins and aunts. His sporting proclivi-
ties are well known; and they should get
him a lot of votes in a constituency which
contains thousands of sailing men. Besides
being a racy talker, he has what they call
“presence,” and a tall and very pood-looking
wife. Before the war he lived in Went-
worth (out Edgecliff way), which was
more than the sitting member did; and he
took a lot of interest in local affairs.
William Charles Wentworth had an annual
bouquet thrown at' his memory on Saturday,
the actual wreath being placed upon the
mausoleum by Archdeacon D’Arcy Irvine,
while immortelles fell from the lips of the
president of the Vaucluse Trustees. The
speaker, before he came to the extolling of
the Australian patriot, managed to make
the occasion another injustice to Ireland by
refusing to refer to the first tenant Brown-
Hayes as anything but an “Irish ruffian.'’
As the listeners grew tired, the little con-
gregation melted into ones and twos in
the green spaces of the garden. A grandson
of the explorer-statesman and two small
great-grandchildren. Mary and Neville Went-
worth ; tall and fair Mrs. Hainbridge, in
French grey; and Dr. Herrick Knowles and
his attractive little wife were among those
who walked amid the freshness of a storm-
cleansed garden.
The ceremony at the tomb of W. C. Went-
worth must have stirred some sad memories.
A few years ago, before the Fitzwilliam
Wentworths, were driven from Greycliff by
the Socialistic hand of the Government, the
neighborhood of the mausoleum was a plea-
saunce on which the family and its friends
disported themselves every Sunday. The
Hut, the little old edifice huddled under the
hill to. the east of Greycliff, had housed
generations of distinguished lunchers in its
time. There were cooked, under the super-
vision of such experts as W. A. Long, Bill
Sparks, M. Grant and a dozen others, the
huge bronzewing turkeys from Burrabogie,
1 lie Wentworths’ station near Ilay. If all
tlie champagne bottles that have been opened
in The Hut were placed on end they would
stretch But the reflection is too poig-
nant. After lunch there was cricket, and
later the guests could wander on the Went-
worths’ private beach or go back to Sydney
by a boat which called at their private
wharf. All these glories have fled. Anyone
can land on the beach nowadays; and the
foreshores in the neighborhood of The Hut
are a rash of suburban villas.
The Bush-Bookers and the Victoria
League have decided to amalgamate, and the
good-fellowship received Vice-Regal approval
on r riday, when their Exes.' summoned the
followers of both factions to meet at
Govment House. The ballroom was the
scene where the alliance was discussed.
I adre Micklcm (lie’s the man who knows all
about the . Isles of the Aegean, and proves
?t by fascinating lantern slides) spoke up
for the Victoria League, while Mrs. David
looked and sounded alluring in the cause of
the Bush Book Club. Then everybody had
supper. Amongst the sandwich-eaters were
the. Hugheses, the titled ones; a strong bat-
talion of the Knoxes; striking-looking Mrs.
Maxwell Scott in grey ; Dorothea Mackellar,
wearing a nocturne in green and mauve; the
Acting-Justice Ralstons; Empire-building
Mrs. W augh ; Beatrice Macdonald, who has
.lust written a striking review of the latest
de Morgan novel; and, of course, invaluable
Hanbury Davies.
A unique meeting happened at the Sports
Club the other night. Five honorary mem-
bers present wore the V.C., and the quintette
met one another for the first time.
There are 10 seats in the Senate of Svd-'
ney University waiting to be filled, and the
women grads, say they ought to have at
least one of them; and .surely they should.
So they met lately
and in due form took
nominations, an d
there hadn’t to be an
exhaustive ballot to
choose Dr. Co n-
stance D’Arcy. They
thought well over it.
Should the women’s
representative he
med. or arts? This
was before personali-
ties were discussed.
Med. had it. Amiable
Constance Elizabeth
has a Macquarie-
street plate; she
was one of the
earlier women-gradu-
ates in medicine and
surgery—anyhow, in
the Middle Ages of the early nineteen-
hundreds. There are not enough women-
gradsi to give her a seat without men’s help ;
but there certainly are enough of them to
entitle them to one-tenth of the seats offer-
ing. So fair-minded man is expected to vote
accordingly. There’s'- a May Moore picture
of Dr. D’Arcy herewith.
With the exception of a handful of enthusi-
astic, and in many cases professional, garden-
ers, Sydney with a great unanimity absented
itself from the Rose Show. Yet the blooms
were wonderful. Masses of glowing sweet-
ness, they languished their life away in the
unsympathetic barrenness of the Town Hal!.
Two possible solutions of the problem of
how to make our Rose Show a success:
first, increase the value, of the prizes (men
like Sam Hordern and Owen Cox and other
public-spirited citizens are sufficiently in-
terested in horticulture to offer prizes that
the suburban gardener would feel proud to
have on his sideboard) ; second, take a
smaller and more attractive hall. In
Christchurch, in Maoriland, every man is
his own rose-grower, and to get into the
Rose Show is nearly as strenuous as fight-
ing your way to the tram after a Spring
meeting at Randwick. It is the only occa-
sion on which Christchurch forgets that it
is an English gentleman. You may even
see a blue rose in the Avon-sprinkled city.
It is almost an iris blue; but its grower is
worried because he can’t induce it to bloom
with a “heart.”
Mr. Jinarajadasa, the cultured Indian to
whose Theosophy serious Sydney is listen-
ing with rabid ear, was the feature of the
Conservatorium lecture-concert last week.
Slim and bespectacled and Cambridge to his
vowel-tips, he caused quite a thrill in the
breast of the musical critic. In the most
exquisite language he proved his case that
music brings one closer to Heaven than any
other of the arts; but when he further re-
marked that the present-day dancing was
produced by the same mental unrest as
Bolshevism, some people stirred uneasily in
their seats. A vision of Sam Hordern and
Adrian Knox (both persistent dance-givers of
late) heading an army with the cry “Down
with capital 1” smote shudderingly across
the inward eye.
Mrs. J. I. Brittain,
popular wife of the
American Consul-
General, smiles a re-
gretful farewell to
Australian friends,
for of all the corners
of the earth to which
Mr. Brittain’s work
has taken them, she
whispers that she
likes Australia next
best to America.
Everybody knows
what Mrs. Brittain
has done in the mat-
ter of war works;
what everybody
doesn't know is that
the lady is an ac-
complished linguist,
;m AI.A. of Oberlin College, Ohio, and a
charming hostess. The Brittains turn their
backs on Turramurra and face Winnipeg,
where there are more real-estate agents
gathered together than there are in all the
rest of the earth. May Moore took the
photo.
Ihe inaugural Anzac Memorial meeting
was scarcely a huge success from an attend-
ance point of view, and all the woinen-
speakers except the Brig.-General Herring
lady mentioned the shortness of the notice
they had received. One frightened male tried
to throw the blame on Webster, but Her
Bx. s head proclaimed the negative she did
not speak. The Edgeworth David lady’s cul-
tured and mellow periods supported the pro-
posed building of a Alemorial Hall and the
purchase of bursaries for soldiers’ kiddies.
Dame Margaret Davidson uttered the same
sentiments, with a leaning towards the bur-
saries, and Mrs. Herring arid Gladys Owen
threw in amens. So the month of Novem-
ber is to be run as a serial fund-raiser, the
last instalment to be collected with a bang
on Payday, 28th.
Dream days and nights of faery—that is
the way water-colorist Cocks sees his Blue
Mountains; and he has dipped his brush into
ms vision and given the result in a collec-
tion at the Aldeniioven Gallery. The Moun-
tains in storm and in golden glory are there,
and bits of the South Coast vibrant with
sea-strength. Romance and a quiet happi-
ness are in much of the work, perhaps in
no canvases more happily displayed than in
A Sunlit Road” and “On the Road to
Blackheath.” Yet the man who paints with
the sunbeams and the mist is a sick man
chained to his Mountain home as firmly as
Prometheus to his rock.
Early in the evening, at a recent swank
dance ip Paddington Town Hall, guests got
at the beer intended for the band. There
were gallons of sparkling wines corked up,
but the cool lager seemed the only beverage
on tap, and those of the dancers who did
want wine had to speak in silver to the
attendant gods. When the tennis-shirted
trombones and other jazz-whiz-bangers came
to their refreshment they had to break their
drought on the moselle and the hock, with
the result that the fizz got into the wind
instruments, and for the remainder of the
evening the players two-stepped and twinkled
almost into the dancing area reserved for
the highly-chequed guests
Sydney welcomed-home last week Albert
Jacka, the gay lad who won Australia’s first
V .G. m the war. And on the day the Dig-
gers were carrying him ashore with hoorays,
his friends were burying Colonel Courtnev.
the man who recommended Jacka for tlie
honor. It was at Courtney’s Post that
.Jacka did his mad, , magnificent thing; and
the awful, lop-sided chances that his boys
had to take to do anything at all killed the
Colonel in the end. A Melbourne lawyer in
private life, he was a frequent visitor to
Sydney, and was beloved everywhere—om
ol those men whom all women like and non.,
marries.
Llangollen, the old Featherstone home at
CxlebG I oint, has been taken over by the
Education Department as a hostel for zirl
students attending the Teachers’ College The
official opening took place recently, though
some of the students have been in residence
since July. The renewed and extended old
house is tucked away in a long, curving street
that twists and bends its way to the water
front -rather a grim bit of the Harbor now
with timber-yards to its edge. There is a
straggling, overgrown garden with swimming
baths at its foot, overlooked by two domesti-
cated lions that crouch on each side of the
wide stone steps that lead to the several miles
of verandah that surround the building. Some
fine old trees still throw out a protesting
green arm against the brick octopus that has
so nearly enveloped their stronghold. In-
doors everything is bright and shining; each
girl has a tiny room to herself with wooden
bed and combination wardrobe-dressing-table
and a small cupboard of sliding shelves Most
of the rooms open on to balconies. Two of
the rooms have full-length mirrors built into
the walls, and the lucky tenants swank no
end over their possession. Dining-room, rest-
room, library—its imitation parquetry makes
a perject jazz floor on party nights—are fur-
nished with an eye to comfort and harmony.
All the fittings and furniture were made
in the Departmental workshops.
The Women Painters have been attacking
big-brush work with great vigor during tli"
week, and now the pale grey walls are three
tones deeper. The artistic souls thought th«
almost-upon-them show would be more
effective against a darker background So
one day last week they were all at it. over-
ailed and turbaned, slapdashing kalsomine
on the walls. Mrs. Sherwood’s eves danced
Avith the fun of the thing, and Hilda Rix
Xicholas whistled like a jolly schoolbov,
while Mrs. Hedley Parsons and Miss
Solomon lent a rapt ear to the stories of
Sydney James’s Billy that the crinkly-
haired Barling girl rattled out.
The perfection of the Manresa Hall (the
property of the Jesuit fathers at North Syd-
aey, by the way) was again demonstrated
last week when a dance was held for the
Mater Misericordise Hospital, which badlv
needs cash. Not since the brilliant Town
Hall ball in 1914 has the hospital been bene-
fited by a dance, and all the old crowd of
former years turned up; but they mostly
had to give way to the jazzing and fox-
trotting of the junior generation, with per-
haps the chance of a waltz now and then
and euchre for those who felt like it’
Mesdames Murray Curtis. Casper and Leahv
were the hon. sees.. Mrs. Scott and Miss
Corns the hon. treasurers.
Miss Paterson, the blind musician and
the founder and hon. secretary of the After
Care Association, has left for a year’s holi-
day in America. She. is Banjo’s cousin,
and has put many of his verses to music.
Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Scrivener are cele-
Mafins, their silver wedding by giving up
their riverside home at Mornington to rest
from housekeeping. Son Herbert, who lost
a leg m the war, and is now on the staff
of the military farms at Meerut, cabled
that owing to risings in India he can’t
come to Sydney on leave as he had hoped to.
Mary, daughter of Mrs. William Thomas,
of laddington, is this week saving “I will”
to John Morris Hart, son of the late Henry
Hart, of Sydney. Canon Charlton ties the
knot at- St. Andrew’s. A four months’
honeymoon in Japan follows.
Cora Macdonald, second bud of the Neu-
tral Bay Neil Macdonalds, married Walter
Gibson, a young shoot of the Fov and Gib-
son firm, at St. Pat.’s on Saturday. The
wedding had caused a flutter in R.C. circles,
and _ rumors as to trousseau glories, sub-
marine and aboveboard, had caused many a
gasp of envy at tea parties. The wedding
dress was built in mystery, and on Saturday
it burst on the view in all the majesty of
ivory satin bulging as to angle, the panelled
sides outlined in ostrich-feather niching.
This feather ruching occurred at intervals
all over the frock, and train; and in addi-
tion there was a ton or less of cut-crystal
trimming. Bride’s sisters Ivy and jean,
pink as to dress and black as to hat. brides-
maided. and the Wentworth provided chairs
ror the wedding party. The Mountains and
the Cup are the first objectives of the allies;
then London and the food-ration.
After four years in England and America
Nan Garvan returns with a holdful of
smart clothes. Grey is evidently the smart
shade at the other end of the earth; all of
our comebacks sport it with the air of inef-
fable content worn only by the woman who
knows she is the last word. Nan topped
her grey suiting the other afternoon with a
tam of chiffon velvet in the same . gentle
tone. Stay-at-home Claire is the girl who
has kept the motor service for returning
transports running without a hitch.

All these Wonderful Benefits from
Weston'EJtcTric Power and Light
Western Electric Power and Light brings the wonderful comfort and conveni-;
ence of electric light and power to farms, stations, stores, island plantations,
and all beyond the radius of town electricity. It consists of a h.p. Kerosene Engine, a 1500 Watt
Generator, 180 Ampere Hour Battery, and a Switchboard that automatically controls the whole outfit.
Western Electric Power and Light does twice the
work, costs less to run, has greater capacity and
requires less attention than any other outfit. 40
years of electrical experience stand behind it, and
the whole plant is practically foolproof. It floods
all buildings with cheap, safe electric light, and
provides current for Electric Fans, Washing
Machines, Irons, Sewing Machines, Vacuum
Cleaners, and handy Motors, etc. And the 3*/^
h.p. 4-cycle Engine drives all the farm machinery
quite as well as any separate engine on the mar-
ket, and solves the labour problem. Thus West-
ern Electric Power and Light not only gives you
the luxury of electricity but it pays for itself over
and over again. Don’t buy art outfit that only
gives light! Get the powerful Weste. Electric
plant—-it’s easy to buy. Ask us how !20 page

AIRCRAFT ENGINES
are fitted to H.M.A. R’34
The wonderful achievement
of R’34 in making the double
journey across the Atlantic
affords ample proof of the
efficiency of Sunbeam-
Coatalen Aircraft eugines
and machinery. This was
no single flight of a few
hours duration, but a voy-
age of 183 hours. Never
before have any aircraft
engines had to withstand
such a continuous strain.
Having twice crossed the Atlantic, made numer-
ous patrols and trials, and journeyed from end to
end of Germany, R'34 has travelled a distance
roughly equal to 15,000 miles or 300 hours
actual flying— every performance made on
Sunbeam Coatalen Aircraft Engines.

Joe G.: In that case your experience
with the returned Digger doctor has been very
unfortunate.... Wart: John Mathew gives “lubra”
as Tasmanian abo.; and we haven’t found a sounder
authority than Mathew yet....L. Gair: Did you do
that in lisec? It looks like it. ...Seedy: Yes,
very.... Interested: All right; much obliged....
H. Lee: Don’t reprint, thanks all the same....
J.A.F.: Can’t register the fate of pars. They
go in or they go out. If the batch you men-
tion were no better than this last lot, they went
out.... Paul Cox: Can’t give you the information.
Try the Minister again, explaining clearly what
you want Bellerive: “Beauty is Truth,” so here
goes:—
Rheumatics is distressing,
And so is the toothache;
A sore and throbbing finger
Keeps sufferers awake.
These noted common tortures
Make people writhe and mourn
But there’s nothing more unpleasant
Than a hard, tormenting corn.
By plasters ’twill wither,
But ’twill bloometh out again,
And will let you know it's Ludding
By sharp and stinging pain.
To get rid of it for ever
Is a thing we’ve got to know ;
It has intervals and seasons.
The corn upon the toe.
. . . .B.S.II.: “France” is all out in metre. . . .T.S.G. :
Kind out what blank verse is before you try to use
it. Many of the lines are right; some are all wobble and
gasp.... J.B.O.: As far as they can be read they re
not up W.T.T.: Imitative stuff which- doesn’t
touch the classic models of the oft-rejected school
you mention. .. .J.H.L.: They don’t arrive, but they
are well on the road... .R.E.K.: Yarn doesn’t get
anywhere... .Max (Chatswood) : The “chief defects”
are a defiance of grammar and sense... .S.W.P.:
“Strange Case” doesn’t make itself convincing... .

der : Some of the rhymes are bad; and the yarn
isn’t much.... J.A.W.: There is only one writer who
can “doth thinketh” effectively... .M.R.L.: Nothing
is older than a retrospective view of childhood.
The spirit of the child makes all the difference...
Babette: Commonplace... .R.S.Y.S.: “The Old Chap”
is far too thick with false rhythms. Your ideas
are good. ... J.K.M.: Shocking. .. .Quelques Mots : A
weak little pun in verse that deserves a better
subject. .. .N.T. (Clayfield) : Verse not well enough
done....J.II. (Queensland): “Soldiers of Anarchy”
fail. “Psyche” wants some revision... .Simon L.:
They still lack skill... .C.F.P.: Those poppies red
with the blood of heroes have been blooming in
print too freely. .. .Octo: Yarn better forgotten
E.J.G.: Doesn’t seem real.... Chick Fly: Well, try
a sample:—•
The lass picked up the half-crown with a smile,
And spoke loud, so’s I could hear ’er
(Me grinning at ’er all the while) ;
“I sunpose he’s some flash shearer,
Half-drunk and leery; I don’t like his style.”
Sadly I turned and staggered on my way.
Just then the tart began to speak:
“God welcomes you, and bids me say,
Love ye shall find if ye will seek!”
Said I: “You won’t catch me again to-day.”
M.H.W. (probably ; though the W might be the
picture of a gap in a fence) : “De Gustibus” won’t
do. .. .M.H.C.: Not up....J.H.: ‘'Weariness” and
“The Years” miss... .M.J.K.: Stiff, conventional
verse on a subject that is worth while.... Peter
Piper: Not nearly Clan G.: No use for lazy stuff
with the rhymes left out and violent bumps in the
( scansion... .K.S.: “Pledge” unsuitable... .T.G.:
* Those gulls say too little, and none of it is fresh
The Village Plumber: Not far off.... Bill B.: The
vegetables don’t dance well.... French to Aussie:
Bad....J.B. (Cairns): It may be an “Ode,” but
it sounds more like something cut with a circular
saw Omeo: Nowhere near... .A.M. (Kew) : No
use. .. .R.H.D.: The verse would need to be better.
Joke too faint... .C.D.C.: “Tony” wants something
more Thomas F.: Not up, but a little careful
work might have made it so... .J.A. (Newmarket):
Not quite.... Erskine: It must go back....L.F.
(Cairns): They miss... .Ne’er-do-Well: Not quire
up... .Westerner: A long way off... .Kay Jay: “The
Song of My Soul to My Heart” is the worst song
we’ve heard this side of the Armistice. . . .Robin Red-
breast: “The Coming of Spring” is derailed.... Reg
S.: As you sav, the title is good. .. .L.G.: “Although
they’ve torn me from my love apart! ” Thank your
lucky stars.... Mungadal: No promise in the verses.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
R.V.F.: No boots to-day, thank you....J.R.: But
why make the nurse look like a poisoned cow ?....
P. J.C.: Figures badly placed. Strive for more humor.
. . .A.D.A.: A sad drunk who seems to know that he has
been drawn sober.... Itirklee: Bundle of dirty scraps
of paper rejected... .J.M.: That’s not an idea....
M.L.: The British lion has often looked sick; but
you’ve given him a straw mane and he feels wretched
about it... .S.K.E.: Scratches only... .G.L.: It’s all
wrong. .-. .E..J.P.: Don’t start a factory for that sort
of joke... D.L.M.: Your Digger is a wooden image... .
A.W.A.: Too much detail and not enough knowledge
of drawing... .C.S.M.: No expression .S.H.: The
attached gag says the object the man is holding up
is a collar. It looks like a bit of melon-rind....
W.H.C.: Too late. Wait for the next war, and
meantime learn to draw... .R.C.: No sparkle in it.
....Fred F.: Improve your drawing... .E.H.B.: All
sad and silly.... F.D.: Bristol board, India ink and
a few years’ study... .A.C.H.: One of the best jokes
of an earlier generation.
“Petramos”: In Melbourne the other day
a returned soldier, charged with illegally
wearing a uniform, pleaded that he was com-
pelled to do it because he couldn’t wear the
civvy clothes supplied to him. If all Diggers
wore the suits issued by the Defence Depart-
ment, the Repat. would have a tougher task
than ever to find them jobs. Incidentally,
there are no hats for Billo. He gets a cap,
plain (as worn by burglars in melodrama)
or fancy (as affected by gents in the movie
underworld). Occasionally some lucky Digger-
gets a suit that he almost fits, but a grand
parade of men in the Defence Department’s
civvies would dishearten the most optimistic-
scarecrow.

The
NEW EDISON
is not a talking machine. It does not give a mere mechanical and only
approximate reproduction of musical sounds. It positively
RE-CREATES MUSIC
This word Re-create is not a fantastic description—but exact in accurately
describing the result achieved by Edison’s wonderful new invention.
Numerous great artists have sung and played in direct comparison with Edi-
son s re-creation of their work, and famous musical critics, in their own papers,
admit that they cannot distinguish between an artist’s voice or instrumental
pertormance and Edison's Re-creation of it.

Make Your Backache
Quickly Disappear.
NSf
Mrs. E. MARSHALL (from a photo by
Monte. Luke).
I am pleased to write you about
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills. Having
suffered from Backache and Kid-
ney Trouble, it had me that I
didn’t care if I lived. I tried all
kinds of remedies. Seeing your
advertisement in the paper, I was
induced to try your pills, and, to
my delight, the first bottle did me
good. I continued with the Gin
Pills, taking half a dozen bottles,
which cured me.
I always keep a large bottle in
the house, and can recommend
them to anyone suffering as I did.
You may use this as you wish.
Yours gratefully,
(Sad.)
Mrs. EDWARD MARSHALL,
“Ilford,”
Australia Street,
Woollahra.
Gin Pills Will Help You.
If you feel that your Kidneys are the cause of your illness, your run-down feeling, begin
taking Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache and Kidney Trouble, because as soon as your kidneys
improve they will help the other organs to health.
Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache and Kidney Trouble relieve the worst cases because they
remove the cause of such troubles ; they get to the root of the matter, clean out the kidneys and
make them filter out all the poisonous waste matters and uric acids that lodge in the joints and
muscles, causing Rheumatism. They soothe and heal the bladder and quickly relieve you. They
are a unique remedy entirely different from anything you have ever used. There is nothing else
to compare with them. No matter how old you or how long you have suffered, the very prin-
ciple of Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills is such that it is practically impossible to take them into the
human system without obtaining results.
If you suffer with pains in your Back or Sides, or have any signs of Kidney Trouble or
Rheumatism, such as puffy swellings under the eyes or in the feet or ankles, if you are Nervous,
Tired and Run-down or bothered with Urinary Disorders, Dr. Sheldon’s Gin Pills for Backache
and Kidney Trouble are the Remedy which will quickly relieve you of your misery. Price, 1/6
and 2/6.

BOSTOCK’S—THE ECONOMY SHOE POLISH
We wish to stress the fact that ECONOMY is one of the chief attributes of
Bostock Shoe Dressings. It is economical by virtue of the fact that it is more
than a mere polish.
Containing, as it does, ingredients which nourish and preserve the leather, it gives
longer life to footwear.
With the cost of shoes mounting
higher and higher, the daily use
of Bostock’s, with its leather-
preserving qualities, is particu-
larly desirable.

A Ballad of High Adventure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A RED kiss on the morning’s lip,
A whisper down the sea;
And I would go on a rover's ship
Wherever a man may be.
A white, white sail is mine to set.
Now let the sailors sing
To raise an anchor green and wet
At the bidding of a king.
For I am the king of a green way,
And I am the king of a blue;
And where is he will say me nay
In that I list to do?
Up sail! Up heart! The ship is young
And this shall be our sport,
To sing a song that none have sung
In a great white port.
We shall have store of ivory
And ballast red and fine
Of gold a king of Araby
Gives rover men for wine.
The king shall give us rubies red
And pearls from out the sea,
And turban jewels off his head,
For love of song and me.
Up sail! Up heart! The seas are wide,
And this shall be our sport,
To make a music for a bride
In a great white port.
We shall have store of spices sweet,
And silk from off the loom,
And scented carpets for our feet
Where red poppies bloom ;
And she shall send her bridesmaids nine
To wave our ship to sea
And break a ribbon mooring-line
„ And blow a kiss to me.
Up sail! Up heart! The ship is young.
And this shall be our quest.
With prayer said and song sung
To find an isle of rest.
We shall have salt of the fine spray
And toil and long sleep.
And white sand in a blue bay
And a secret word to keep;
For one shall come in the yellow night
With stars and a full moon
And bring me. wrapped in a scarf of white,
The world’s great boon.
Up sail! Up heart! The ship is young,
But younger still is she.
Th n child that came of the song sung
For love of the song and me.
A red kiss on the morning’s lip.
A whisper down the wave :
I shall come home in a rover’s ship,
A man’s soul to save.
White, white shall my sail be furled;
Then let the sailors sing
To cast the anchor of the world
For joy of a queen and king.
N.s.w.
DAVID McKEE WRIGHT.
A Put-up Job.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HIS name was John Deuteronomy
Bone, and he was a certified clergy-
man, a minister of the Congregated
Brethren of the Greater Advent, a Noncon-
formist body that had positively no connec-
tion with the church next door or any chapel
in the adjoining street, for the reason that
all other churches were eaten with the can-
ker of worldliness, and gnawed by the worm
of subservience —subservience to wealth,
position, ease and all unrighteousness.
The Rev. John Deuteronomy Bone was a
very tall, very thin saint of about 34, dark-
eyed and hollow-cheeked, his long nose tinged
with a certain asceticism that turned it pale
at the tip, giving it some suggestion of a
snow-capped mountain. His habitual ex-
pression was one of great seriousness, as
became a man fully conscious of the fact
that if he failed in the accomplishment of
his life’s mission nine-tenths of his fellow-
creatures must be damned to all eternity.
John, as he stood, was the moral, and, to
a large extent, the physical output of three
aunts. The three aunts were Aunt Rosy,
Aunt Jess and Aunt Josephine, and they
lived together in extraordinary uniformity
at The Shell, 11 Church-avenue, Brighton,
three little old spinsters of the year 1865,
from which date they drew all their ideas
in hats and gowns. They even w’ore the
prunella boot of the period mentioned, and
their preconceptions on all subjects belonged
to the day when they were 18 or thereabout.
The three aunts had adopted Johnnie
when he was four, they had trained him for
good works, and now that he was a married
man and a father he was still largely depen-
dent upon Miss Rosy, Miss Jess and Miss
Josephine, for it was their money kept his
little red church in the Port in a fairly
satisfactory financial condition. Every Sun-
day morning they drove in their foolish little
old landau, that ran on wheels scarcely big-
ger than those of a perambulator, drawn by
their little old shaggy pony not larger than
a mastiff, all the way from Brighton to the
Port to hear John preach ; and every Sun-
day they each placed a one-pound note in
the plate to set an example of munificence to
the rest of the thin congregation.
John Deuteronomy Bone caught Gapper
the Snag red-handed. John, disturbed at
the belated composition of a sermon by a
little stir among his pigeons, went into the
yard, and flashed an electric torch on the
Snag, who, at the top of a step-ladder, was
busy stuffing birds taken from the ark-
shaped pigeon-house into a bag.
“Come down, my friend,” said John,
quietly but firmly.
The Snag paused a moment, mentally de-
bating the point—should he jump straight
and with both feet on to the blighter's
bleached nose, and take his chance of making
a break over the back fence in the confusion
that must ensue, or would he climb down,
and make a good show of penitence, pending
an opportunity of hitting out the owner of
the pigeons with as natty a little whale-
bone club as ever cracked on an occiput,
which weapon was just then lying easy and
accessible against the Snag's left-side fifth
rib?
Gapper climbed down. “God’s truth,
boss,” he whined, “you know ’ow 'ard it is
fer a bloke to live round about here these
times.”
“I do know,” replied John gently; “but
no hardness of the times, no bodily afflic-
tion justifies sin. I am sure that in your
heart you must know that.”
Gapper the Snag thought he might do
without the club, after all. and felt a little
virtuous thrill while registering the good in-
tention. It was an act of renunciation, for
the Rev. Bone had a quaint little bald spot
the size of two-and-sixpence right on the
apex of his skull, which shone forth as a
mark inviting the best effort of the sports-
man.
“A-course I do, boss. But you gotta pinch
a little. It’s all account of the ’igh cost of
livin’.”
“What is your name, my poor boy?” John
laid a hand on the shoulder of the pigeon-
stealer.
“Artie Gapper,” said the Snag. Then, as
a bright after-thought, “Honest Artie they
calls me down roun’ the Town Pier, where
I’m workin’ mostly, but out iv a job now,
and me ole mother sick and me sister bed-
rid.”
“Well, Artie, I am not going to hand you
over to the police; I am going to make a
man of you. I am going to help you to be-
come a good citizen and a true Christian.
There is a police constable leaning on the
lamp-post opposite the forge at this moment,
but I do not need his assistance. I am
going to demand of you that you give me
the opportunity of reforming you. I ask
nothing more. You will come to our gym-
nastic class at the Sunday-school hall on
Friday evenings at eight. You will come to
the Mutual Testimony meetings on Tues-
day Do you agree?”
_ “My oath!” was the touching reply. “I
bin longin’ fer a chance like this, cobber.
I have, s’elp me.”
“Very well then ; I shall take you to your
parents, and have an understanding with
them. I want their assurance that you will
be faithful in attendance. I want some
serious talk with them both. You may keep
four of the pigeons for your sick sister.
And I may assist you in other ways if you
are deserving.”
Gapper the Snag was' nineteen, although
small and shrunken for his years, and he
had been far beyond parental control since
he was seven ; but he allowed the Rev. John
Bone to accompany him home, and John
saw his mother. Fortunately the good
woman was not too drunk to understand the
situation when it was explained to her. and
she wept quite convincingly over Artie’s
lapses, which, it seemed, happened in de-
fiance of the good, honest, religious upbring-
ing that of a boy had received at
her hands.
Artie’s father was away earning his living
as a night watchman (lie was spotter at the
Barnacle Arms), and the sick sister was,
it transpired, sick at another address.
“Very well,” said John, “it is understood
the boy comes to our gymnastic class to-
morrow night. I trust to you to see that
lie attends, Mrs. Gapper. On these terms
I shall not put the police on his trail.”
“He’ll come, sir, if I 'ave to carry ’im
kickin’ all the way.”
“I am sure that will' not be necessary.
I am certain Artie knows I mean well uy
him. and that I can be the saving of him.”
When John said good night to Gapper
the Snag he left something in the hand of
that bright youth.
“Well, so ’elp me—arfer quid !” said the
Snag. “Now what’s his lay. ole girl?”
“Dunno,” replied his good mother. “ ’less
lie’s wantin' you to work in with him on
somethin’.”
Artie did attend the gymnastic class, a
gathering at which boxing bouts, dumb-bell
exercises, feats on the horizontal bar and
tussles with the Sandow developer were
gracefully interspersed with brief Bible-read-
ings, two prayers and two hymns to make a
pleasant evening’s entertainment.
The Snag took great delight in “putting
it over” the small boys of John’s class with
the fat gloves, and showed himself so dexter-
ous in the physical exercises that John, as
a further inducement, offered him five shil-
lings a fortnight to attend in the capacity
of instructor.
“I know you will grow to love the work,
and I know you will become a good man, a
brand from the burning. Don’t doubt the
power of good works. I myself am an out-
standing example of what grace may do
There was a time when I wallowed in the
sink, when I was prone to iniquity, when no
sin was too black for me. no woman too bad
and no drink too strong.”
It was John Bone’s firm belief that at one
stage of his comparative youth he had been
a very devil of a fellow, an opinion based
on one escapade with two schoolmates and
a bottle of beer, a boyish attempt to smoke
a scented cigarette, and a surreptitious visit
to a music-hall at the age of 18.
John was disturbed somewhat by Artie’s
manner of receiving this shocking assurance.
Artie grinned a dry, sly, thin grin, and
winked so hard his eyelid almost clicked.
The Rev. Bone firmly believed that by
virtue of his Tuesday and Friday evening
classes he was dong his bit towards the re-
generation of mankind, and it was not long
before he came to regard Gapper the Snag
as a striking proof of the success of his
methods. Having arrived at perfect faith
in Artie, he put to that hopeful the necessity
of his doing some honest work. The three
Miss Horsefalls, of The Shell, 11 Church-
avenue, Brighton, were in need of a faithful
servitor to tend the shaggy pony, dig in the
garden, chop the wood, run messages and do
all the odd jobs about the place, while acting
as guardian of the home and protector of the
innocent.

FOR SORES & INJURIES
ZAM-SUK IS THE EVER-READT HEALER.
WHATEVER your skin trouble—be it a simple cut or a festering sore—Zam-buk is the healer you can
absolutely rely upon. This balm is unsurpassed for injuries sustained either in the home or workshop,
for wounds that fester and get poisoned, for burning eczema and disfiguring sores, and for itching piles.
within a pot of Zam-Buk are stored most valuable healing, soothing and antiseptic properties. Zam-
Buk’s active ingredients are purely vegetable, and it contains no lard or rancid animal fat whatever, as do
common ointments, and its wonderful character makes it of priceless value.
TORN BY BARBED WIRE. Mr. Archie McKenzie, of 85 Pirie
—— Street, Adelaide, writes :—“I had
a severe accident a short time ago through some rolls of barbed-wire slipping
and lacerating my hands, arms and legs. While bathing the injured place, I was
advised to try an application of Zam-Buk. This was so successful that I had
no necessity to see a doctor, and in a few days I was enabled to resume my
work.”
CRUSHED FINGER AND FESTERED LEG.— M s Lil >'
——— Hogan,
77 liveleigh Street, Redfern. Sydney, writes: —“My husband got one of his fingers
crushed at the foundry where he works some time ago. The inflammation spread
up the band and arm, which were very much swollen, and the pain was so severe
lie could hardly get any sleep at night. He was recommended to use Zam-Buk,
and after applying the balm night and morning each day his hand rapidly
improved. The inflammation was all drawn out, and it finally healed without any
trace of the scar remaining.
He also had a very bad leg, which festered and became very much inflamed,
but Zam-Buk quickly healed it. We both have the greatest faith in the balm.”
INFLAMED HAND. Mrs. Edith Leach, 331 Spencer Street, West Mel-
~ bourne, writes: —“A few months ago my husband had
his hand badly bitten by a horse. It became very much inflamed, and caused him
so much pain that he was unable to do any work for some time. He was advised to
try Zam-Buk, and the first application eased the pain. Continued treatment with
the balm banished all the inflammation and healed the wound in a very short time.
“My husband always uses Zam-Buk for cuts, bruises and other injuries, and I have
also found it a splendid remedy where the children are concerned.”
CHILD’S TERRIBLE SCALDS. Mrs. M. Dillon, 1 Clarendon
7 ; —‘ Street, Dunedin, N.Z., says:—
“When my boy Willie was 13 months old he got terribly scalded. I happened to
be cooking at the stove at the time, and when my back was turned the child
pulled a pot of boiling liquid all over his head and face.
“I sent for a pot of Zam-Buk and began to apply dressings of the balm night
and morning. Zam-buk soon took all the ‘fire’ and pain out of the scalds, and
prevented the development of any bad symptoms. We persevered with Zam-buk
for a few days, and it healed perfectly and left no trace of the injuries.”

"There are valuables in the house, Arthur,
my boy,” John explained. "The old ladies
have small conception of the danger they
run, but with a man about the place, a faith-
ful servant, one who, like yourself, has
courage and skill, I should have no misgiv-
ings about them. You understand me. my
boy?”
“I tumble,” said dapper. “I'm on.”
dapper the Snag took office with Aunties
Rosy and Josephine and Jess. Once only
he drove the shaggy pony to church, and on
the following Monday night, at about 12,
the Rev. John, a faithful keeper of early
hours, as a rule, was awakened by a tapping
on his window-pane. Raising the window,
the minister discovered the figure of young
Artie dapper in the darkness without.
"Lemme in. boss,” whispered the Snag. “I
done it.”
"Done it! You have done what?”
“Ah, stuff that! Lemme in. and you'll
see.”
John let him in by the back door, and
Artie dropped the bag he was carrying
heavily on the kitchen table.
"You put me on to a pertickler good thing,
all right-o,” said the Snag. “But afore goin’
further I stick out for a fair cut.”
“A fair cut?”
“Yes, fair dink halves.”
“What is this?” demanded the clergyman,
his hand on the hag.
“It’s the junk. What didja expect-—a lit-
ter iv kittens? See here, do you know a
fence, or do we go to my man? Ole Stokes,
the mariney, will do the fair thing by us,
specially if we’re goin' to have dealin’s
reg’lar with him, and we will if you know of
any more cribs as full and as easy as this.
It was a reg’lar soft thing, like peelin’
bernarners.”
The Rev. John Deuteronomy Bone seized
the bag, and turned its contents out on the
floor. It consisted of the valuable old Eng-
lish silver which for as long as he could re-
member had loaded the sideboard of Aunts
Rosy, Jess and Josephine, much of it beaten
flat by the Snag for convenience of transit.
EDWARD DYSON.
A Bit of ’Bacca.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HE prison bell in the .centre-yard
clanged sharply for a second time,
and the lines of drab-clothed prisoners
shuffled from their various employments and
fell in. The many who had been lurking in
the lavatories to enjoy a whiff of “weed.”
furtively acquired, had previously, at the
first clang, hurried back to their working
stations. It was a dull performance, which
many of the prisoners would have to go
through hundreds of times before they got
their release, but it was a preliminary to
dinner, and though that was a bare enough
thing, it was the most interesting in the
gaol routine. Over dinner it is possible to
wake a little sporting excitement by having
a bet with yourself as to whether there are
one or two mouthfuls of real meat with
the fat and bone.
“From th’ look of Tusks,” whispered my
neighbor in the rank, hoarsely, “there’s
something doing.”
“Tusks,” the tall, square-shouldered
deputy-governor, arrogant of appearance
and manner, earned his nickname from the
droop of his grey moustache. He was speak-
ing to the tubby, jolly-faced chief warder,
who looked as unlike a chief warder, or a
warder of any. kind, as it is possible to
imagine, while the lowlier warders leaned
on the atmosphere, and the lines of prisoners
shuffled their feet. It was a sign of ner-
vousness : no one knew where the penalty for
whatever breach of discipline had been
noticed was going to fall.
“Cleaners in Ranges 2, 4 and 5 two paces
forward,” came the command suddenly.
“Sharply, now! Here, aren’t you a cleaner?
Thought so—get forward! Mahoney, search
i hat fellow very carefully.”
“Gorstruth!” whispered my neighbor,
“they’re going to search ’em for weed. It’ll
mean three days’ dark cells for all of ’em.”
“Some of them might not have any,” I
answered, in the same sort of aside.
“What’s the good of them being cleaners
if they haven’t?” he retorted. Cell doors
are left wide open to air the cells while
their occupants are away ; and the cleaners,
who hang about the various ranges all day,
pretending to be polishing the bolts and
brasswork, rusted by sea air, have every
opportunity of collaring weed from the cells
where the description card at the door adver-
tises the “indulgence.” Only that morning,
in my own range, I had heard one indulgence
man swearing vengeance for the disappear-
ance of half his week’s supply of tobacco.
To rook a man of half a week’s supply was
over the odds.
Although several moments had passed, the
suspects were still standing in the odd rank
they had formed. Tusks and the Chief
Warder were talking, and’ had called up two
other warders.
“I believe,” whispered my neighbor,
hoarsely, “they're going to call up some
more. I don’t want any dark cells! Here,
look after this for me. mate.”
“Stop talking there!” The attention of
the officials was turned again on the ranks,
and I could not have forced back the stuff
that my neighbor had suddenly pressed into
my hand without exposing him—and per-
haps earning suspicion myself. I slipped
the weed into the pocket which my jacket,
differing from most gaol jackets, possessed.
“Cleaners in Ranges 6 and 7. two paces
forward,” came the order. With the alacrity
of one who has a clear conscience my neigh-
bor stepped out, easily the first.
That tobacco weighed heavily upon me
during the time of dinner in the cell and the
period of exercise, that followed. I had more
reason to dread the penalty for being found
with the forbidden stuff than the other man,
who at all events had his fixed term to serve ;
for having foolishly gone into Long Bay
with the idea that release was a simple
matter, and not the affair of days that I
found it, I did not want a punishment for
misdemeanor to defer my departure when the
order for release came. For a moment 1
felt inclined to renounce the risk and act
the informer, but, though I cursed the man
who passed his danger on to me, I could
not do that. I levied my commission for
risk on the stuff in a smoke I did not par-
ticularly enjoy, and then secreted the balance
in that portion of my clothes most approved
as a hiding-place. I am giving away no
secrets about that hiding-place, although the
prison authorities ought long ago to have
guessed it.
hen we fell in again to ranks after the
post-dinner exercise the owner of the weed
was not present, so I had to continue to bear
my burden. It carried with it a double
apprehension; for above the ordinary risk
there was the chance of what might happen
if the order for release should come that
afternoon. Prisoners are searched before
leaving, and that search is the most rigorous
of all. The gaol authorities are afraid of
losing some of their valuable silver and
cutlery.
But the afternoon passed on with its
usual monotony. The “privilege” of not
having to work had made me nearly frantic,
and after many poundings at the cell door
I had induced my range-warder to secure
for me the occupation I craved. It was a
barren sort of job—unpicking canvas ham-
mocks in preparation for the laundry; chop-
ping up wood for fuel (fine pieces of cedar
and other valuable timber going in with the
faggots) ; picking oakum that seemed to
have been picked many times; sorting out
the number-labels that had been discarded
by departed prisoners and placing them in
order, or making new numbers—all apologies
lor work, but better than doing nothing.
For one comparatively glorious forenoon I
had the job of cleaning the extremely dusty
house where their legal advisers are allowed
to interview prisoners. That job established
lor me a reputation as “the best worker in
the place”—-not a very high commendation —
and caused me to be regarded as a curiosity
by those warders and prisoners who knew
of it; hut the toil passed one of the shortest
mornings I knew at Long Bay. Still, such
jobs are scarce, and I had to live through
the weary minutes doing nothing slowly—
the warder did not want the pretence-work
used up too quickly—helping to pad out my
job by watching a half-caste sailorman try
to slaughter mosquitoes (he was in for desert-
ing his ship, a similar offence to that of
half a dozen others, who considered “doing
a month” a cheap price for liberty), and
envying the bootmaker, who, having a
trade, was engaged in the comparatively in-
teresting job of half-soleing and heeling.
“He’s got a temper.” whispered the
oakum-picker near me. indicating the boot-
maker. “and sometimes they won’t trust him
with knives. But lie’s going out in a day
or two now.”
“One hundred and five !”
The cull for which I had been waiting
with eager anticipation gave me a tremor
now, weighted with the knowledge of that
illicit tobacco. But the call was not mv
release. My reputation had earned me a
job in A hall, and there I went, listening
to the instructions of my new warder as
to the sanctity of tobacco and the penalty
for sacrilegious theft.
The opportunity for work was a pleasant
change, but I found, as I did not now fall
into ranks, that the chance of returning
that tobacco to the man who gave it to me
was remote. I was tempted to get rid of
the thing; but for several reasons I hesi-
tated. One was that for some queer reason
I felt an obligation to restore it, if pos-
sible ; another that it might be discovered
in my receptacles that left the hall, where-
upon inquiries would be made; and, any-
way, one would be loth to throw away gold,
even with a guilty knowledge that if had
been stolen, and tobacco is prison gold. So
I continued with the weed and my apprehen-
sions.
“There’s more trouble over thieving to-
bacco,” remarked Warder Kelly. “Keep off
it. hundred and five, however much you
want a smoke. The chief’s coming round
in a minute or so about it.”
Pleasant news! But Warder Kelly was
good enough to leave his cap on his desk
and go upstairs to a cell at the furthest end
of the hall. I made up my mind promptly.
When Kelly put on his cap to meet tlie
deputy-governor the tobacco was comfort-
ably placed within it, between the leather
and the lining.
“One of the appeal men’s been complain-
ing that he’s been losing his tobacco and
sugar,” said Tusks. “We’re going to put
down this tobacco-stealing.”
“Hundred and five’s new,” said Kelly.
“The man before him we caught.; he’s in
colls now. But I don’t think you’ll find any
stolen tobacco anywhere about here, sir.”
And he moved his cap on his head.
“Who’s the other man? Oh, fifty-eight.
They’ll both be searched.”
“Cell, hundred and five; cell, fifty-eight.”
So we were searched —an operation for
which the officials gave an unexpected
apology; and Warder Kelly visited all the
cells with Tusks, inquiring about tobacco
losses, and all the time that weed was press-
ing against his forehead.
I found an opportunity of removing it
shortly afterwards —there was danger in
leaving it; and. later, having a message from
the hall to the warder of Range 6, who
had books, I passed it back to its owner
by right of theft.
“YouTe a blanky good bloke, mister.” he
said; “and if ever— —— ’Ere. ’ave ’alf!”
“Not for me!” I answered. “It’s given
me enough worry already.”
“Well, I’ll pay yer for it. mister, some
day,” he said and held out his hand.
When I got back to the Hall the release
had arrived.

REFRIGERATING AND
ICE-MAKING MACHINERY.
While the Greatest Selling factor in our machines is probably
their ECONOMY IN RUNNlNG—which is pertinent to the times
—their DEPENDABILITY counts a great deal for their
popularity. Even under the most severe conditions they can be
relied upon to give “CONSISTENT SERVICE.” Their strong
construction, and the great care taken in their manufacture is
the reason for this. Machines installed 25 years ago are still
at work to-day, giving the same service as when first installed.
We study your requirements and design the layout of your
plant, not only to accomplish a given result, but to do so with
an initial expenditure and maintenance cost. Our extensive
experience we place at your service.

Lister Engines are Here Again.
sd
Thoroughly reliable engines were required by the British Armies on all fronts, and Lister Engines were taken
just as fast as they could be produced. That is why this famous All-British Engine has been
unprocurable during the period of war. It is a quality engine, quite distinct from the majority of
farm engines which are merely made to sell at a low price.
WHY THE LISTER LEADS. Few Wearing Parts; High Tension Magneto, Variable Quantity Governor;
Automatic Lubrication. Other features comprise Non-flooding Carburetter, Feed Pump for fuel* two
Fly Wheels, and the whole plant is heavily built and a wonderful engineering job.

THE “CURVILINEAR” MAKES GOOD
A PLAIN STATEMENT OF FACTS.
At the New Venture Tin Co.’s Mill, Ardlethan, New South Wales, two “Curvilinear” Concentrators were installed for testing
against other Concentrators of the most approved type. These machines have been working for months under the closest scrutiny
by the Manager, and the Managers of other Mines, in order to decide whether they would mstal Curvilinear Tables m their new
Mills in preference to those tables which have hitherto been considered standard. The result is that the Big Bygoo and Lone Hand
have ordered six for their new Mill, and orders for other Mills are to follow. ... , , ,
This proves that we did not put forward a freak. No one imagined that it was possible to make such a long stride m the art
of table concentration. We have produced a machine only half the size and we.ght of other tables yethas a, largertonnage mtdtes
cleaner concentrates, has no danger line, requires little or no atttention, is fool-proof, an gg p
t 0 W An extraction of 93.6 per cent, has been obtained under ordinary working conditions on tin ore, which is easily a record. Last,
but not least, it is equally good on slime or coarse material.
Yet with all these advantages the price is 30 per cent, below the prices of other concentrators.
