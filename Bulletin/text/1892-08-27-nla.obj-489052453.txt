ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO

The Man for the Lash.
We hope that New South Wales Minister
of Justice O’Connor will not take it amiss
that we offer him a few suggestions in rela-
tion to the Cat-o’-nine-tails Bill which he
is drafting. It is understood, from the
announcements which in the daily press
presage the coming glory of the enactment
which is to hand down the name of O’Connor
to posterity, that its stern application is
designed for the larrikin class chiefly.
Offences of physical brutality are to be dealt
with correspondingly. The law is to meet
the offenders half-way, and the brutal
criminal is to be reformed, or prevented, or
something by the knowledge, subsequent to
the offence, or at the stage of its inception,
that the State is a match for him—that is to
say, as great a brute as he. The customary
argument in favour of administering to a
blackguard who bashes a blackguardly bashing,
hobbles along somewhat thuswise : that such
offenders are insensible to all moral in-
fluences, and that it is only through their
hides and by working on their physical
cowardice that any effect can be wrought on
them. Without periphrasis, wo simply
remark that this is a foolish argument. It
starts by assuming that the failure of the
gaol methods to reform ruffians is tantamount
to a failure of moral influences. That is to
say, it falsely pretends that there is real
moral amelioration in the existing prison
discipline. Next, it presumes that a rough
is the man of all others to be reduced to
docility and refinement by physical maulings.
This is quite on a footing with an argument
that the fellow who would be most quelled
by a punched head, or most appalled by the
threat of one, is a professional bruiser. We
contend that the current argument is topsy-
burvey. If flogging be curative of vice
or deterrent of crime in any class of
criminals—which we deny - it is the sneak-
ing, scheming, soft - mannered and soft-
muscled, swindling class to whom it is dis-
tinctively applicable.
* # #
While there is no evidence whatever that
the rough has ever been within reach of refin-
ing and moral inducements -indeed the pre-
sumption is all the other way— it is undeniable
that the eminent forger, embezzler, svvin-
tiling land-boomer, bank-director, has been
absolutely immersed and steeped in such
influences. These are men who have shone
among their fellow citizens. They have
been lauded for their intelligence and often
reverenced for their piety. The words of
grace have distilled from their lips, and
their mouths have seemed sweet with
precepts of uprightness. These , we say, are
the men who have been proved impervious
to intellectual and moral influences and
impressions. If the society of the best and
the appreciation of the penalties of wrong-
doing failed to keep them in the paths of
rectitude, how can it be exjrected that the
fellowships of the gaol and the consciousness
of lost caste will so affect them as to keep
their feet from straying ever after ? But,
while it is reasonable to recognise that their
hearts are obdurate, it is equally assured
that their skins are soft. On them the
soothings of sweetness and light have been
tried and have failed. But the effects of
floggings—of physical lesions and extravasa-
tion of blood—have not been tested in their
case. Unlike the rough, with his frame
innured to knocks and shocks, their physical
nerves are finely fibred. A blow which would
make a larrikin merely shake his fuzzy pate,
would disorder their nerves for hours. With
them it is the conscience which is case-
hardened and the flesh which is delicate.
With the larrikin, one never knows whether
conscience has ever been warmed into life by
gentle associations and delicate touches,
while the merely animal part is gross and
insensitive. Therefore, there is room for
hope that such influences may arouse refor-
matory impulses in the rough, but none that
they will touch the proved insensibility of
the “respectable” rogue. If, therefore,
flogging—the infliction of bodily pain—may
be reckoned as potent either for prevention
or reformation, it is the broad-cloth-ed gentle-
man criminal (who never is,|never has been,
and never will be found strapped to the
triangles) to whose case it is applicable,
while the confinement and the moral suasion
are the processes adapted for the vagabond
nature of the coarse-fibred brute.
• # #
But almost certainly we argue in vain*
The fundamental hypotheses which, the
better to expose the absurdity of the current
philosophy of the hour with respect to
punishments, we have adopted for the
occasion, are, we well know, false. The
scandalous fact is that when the public talks
of repression and reformation, it deceives
itself. What really actuates it is a savage
lust of vengeance. Who is there that does
not burn to clutch the throat of the villain
who has outraged his sister or his
daughter ? Who is there that feels no
hot impulse to smash the face of the foul-
mouthed blackguard who violates the
innocent minds of maidens with vile accosts
and remarks at the street corners 'I Who is
there who is insensible to passionate longings
to see the throttling thug of the parks
writhe under the agonies he is so reckless to
inflict ? We do not contend—we never did
advance—that such dispositions are unnatural
or inhuman. But we do assert and will
maintain, that these dispositions stand in the
same category and upon tlie same plane of
morality as those fierce and vindictive pro-
visions of the Mosaic laws which it is boasted
that a later, a greater, and a purer dispensa-
tion has superseded. The longing for sacri-
fices of bleeding larrikins, of scoundrels
scourged till the muscles and sinews, laid
bare, twitch and quiver, because those
scoundrels had made hearts to ache or flesh
to throb with pain is precisely identical with
the savage demand of an eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth.
• # *
The resentment which is felt at crimes of
violence isapt to bemuchmore readily aroused
and much more promptly evoked than that
which is directed against offences of chica-
nery. The reason of this is just that less
intelligence is required to appreciate the
injuries inflicted by the one class of crime
than is necessary to comprehend the other.
The one is simple, the other complex. The
one is direct, the other involved. Thus, if a
man be disfigured by a blow, cause and effect
suggest themselves to the crudest compre-
hension. If a female be forcibly violated,
there is no difficulty about fixing the re-
sponsibility. If a man be ruined by having
his purse wrenched from him, if he be
crippled by an unprovoked assault, in
dignation can discharge itself point-blank
against the perpetrator of the injuries.
If a neighbourhood be rendered almost
uninhabitable by the disorders of gangs of
rowdies, aggrieved society knows whom to
strike. If windows bo broken, it is not
difficult to discover whose hand flung the
stone. But it requires more perception and
a more sustained connection of thought to
realize that the swindler is responsible
for more dishonoured women, for more
crippled men, for more paneless casements,
and puts the community to far greater
expense in maintaining police and judges
and gaols than the larrikin. Although he
does not break men’s jaws and noses, ho
occasions more disfigurements in the linea-
ments of the countenance than the brawler.
It is not mere symmetry of features which
gives the finest beauty to the human face.
Expression is the highest embellishment.
When happiness and hopefulness are ex-
tinguished in a human countenance, it has
become disfigured indeed.
• # •
The rogue who spreads ruin around thus
mars more faces by a hundred fold than
could have been spoilt by him had he been
the most ruffianly brawler. Ho plunges into
destitution women never bred to submit to
deprivation. He scatters families and sends
from the protection of maternal care, to
strive for a living, young girls inadequately
trained to take their own part amidst the
wiles and temptations to which an unguarded
situation exposes them. He shatters homes
in a worse and less reparable fashion than
mere breaking of windows or wrenching of
bell-pulls. The smug, clean-shirted, and
respectably-attired rascal who stands in the
dock looking the embodiment of maligned
virtue and injured innocence does not instan-
taneously excite the repulsion which is
created by the appearance of the soiled and
rumpled ruffian with his unshorn beard and
lowering brow. Yet the latter has but flung a
harmless man in the mud, bashed him beyond
recognition, and robbed him of perhaps the
value of a month’s earnings. The sleek, soft-
handed person, on the other hand, has
hurled a hundred men into the mire of desti-
tution, and broken their hearts and their
spirits in many cases beyond repair, and he
has robbed them, not of a paltry watch and a
handful of coin, but of all they have in the
world—of their provision for old age, of all
that makes life to them worth living. If,
therefore, the comparative gravity of the
two classes of crimes be permitted to have
weight when determinating to which shall be
allotted the severer and more degrading
style of punishment, the conclusion can only
be the same as that arrived at by the con-
siderations as to the efficacy of flogging for
larrikins and for commercial confidence-men
respectively.
The Coming N.S.W. Session.
In a lew days more begins the fiftieth session of
the N.S. Wales Legislature—that enduring
emblem of the hope deferred which maketh the
heart sick. Few legislatures have promised more
and done less than that of New South Wales.
In all the 36 years of its dull, solemn, and
bloatcdly-pretentious existence—since the estab-
lishment of Responsible Government—it has
looked at many great problems and has never
seriously attacked one of them, and all through
its career it has consistently put off everything
of any importance until the morrow —with the
exception of borrowing and log-rolling, which
have never been left undone bv any possible
contingency. About two years from the for-
mation of the first responsible Cabinet in Sydney
John Robertson made his appearance as a
Minister. Henry Parkes turned up eight
years later ; and after that the history of N.S.
Wales consisted of Parkes and Robertson,
and of hardly anything else. Practically, there
is nothing but Parkes and the memory of
Robertson to show after 36 years of turmoil,
riot, ceaseless agitation, wasted energy, lost
hopes, political wars and rumours of war, and
all manner of unrest. The later history of the
province can be told in a sentence. The Legisla-
ture Avas generally too busy turning out Parkes
to put in Robertson, or turning out RobkiN-
son to put in Parkes, to do anything in parti-
cular for the nation. The average Parkes
Ministry never dared attempt anything out of
the beaten track lest it should thereby alienate its
majority and have to give way to Robertson,
and the average Robertson Ministry hung up
all burning questions indefinitely lest by going
out of the ancient rut it should come to grief
and be extinguished by Parkes. Therefore, it
comes to pass that the urgent problems which
the Dibbs Government has to grapple with next
session are very much the same as those which
Parkes and Robertson were just about to
grapple with 30 years ago. These two useless
veterans stumped the country away back in the
ancient history of the “ sixties ” with the same
burning questions which are burning to-day,
and promised to devote their lives to the settle-
ment of them, and never got any further
advanced. There is a species of Chinese stag-
nation in New South Wales politics, and if one
were to hunt up the programme of Premier
Donaldson when he formed the very first
responsible Cabinet of the province, the differ-
ence between it and the programme which
Premier Parkes left unfinished when his last
portfolio dropped from his nerveless hand a few
months ago would be hardly worth mentioning.
# # *
Still everything—even the Local Government
Bill which Parkes travelled on from the begin-
ning of his long career to the very end—comes
to him who waits, and there is just a chance
that the Dibbs Cabinet may redeem some of the
promises whose fulfilment the country has so
long been awaiting. The same hope has sprung
up afresh with the advent of every new Govern-
ment, and the beginning of every new Parlia-
ment, and the opening of every new session for
a whole generation ; but in every case the Legis-
lature merely floated a loan, and rolled a few
personal logs, and passed a wonderful mass of
small, pettifogging enactments, and avoided
every great undertaking on the pretence that
the time was not yet “ ripe.” In its personnel,
however, the Dibbs Ministry is the strongest
that has held office in New South Wales for
over twenty years, and the country can only
trust that it will not fritter away its time and
its strength after the manner of its predeces-
sors. The nation wants four measures in par-
ticular—the establishment of the One-man-one-
vote principle, the eternal Local Government
Act, Tariff Reform, so that the protective
system may become real instead of apparent,
and a comprehensive Banking Bill—and if it
gets these in the ensuing session, the Dibbs
Cabinet will deserve the highest monument
that the province can raise. " But until these
are secured, it doesn’t want the Government to
drift away to consider the Bathurst burr, or
the fees payable to Clerks of Petty Sessions, or
the formation of a tank in the vicinity of Mount
Browne, or the protection of game, or the
diseased animals question, or the recovery of
small debts, or the further entanglement of the
Land Act, or any other of the thousand dry
husks with which the country lias been fooled
for the past three decades. Also, Federation
can rest a while, and there is no hurry f

Amongs all the things which the old hn,.i, t , -
New South Wales politics so consistently wf
undone, it is difficult to decide which .
the most immediately essential, hut fu 6
four measures above-mentioned are suffioi
to fill a busy session, 'and, all thing!
considered their importance is paramount
ihe Local Government Act is Wanf i
for many reasons. The attempt to run tl
entire country from one central office at SvcWv
has proved a woeful failure and a source of
much corruption, The ideal country member
is the blatant mendicant who can, by ceaselcs
dunning, get the most bridges and culverts and
similar concessions out of the consolidated
revenue, and his existence degraded the Levis
lature for years to the level of a bogus bank or
a circus. Until the great issues of Protection
or Foreign-trade made something like a sharn
line of demarcation between parties, the desire
to get roads and bridges was the alpha and the
omega of country politics. The funds of the
Public Works Department were almost solely
employed for purposes of corruption, beam
expended in those electorates whose members
voted for the party then in office. The necessity
of granting public works to get votes, and of
keeping down taxation for the same purpose led
to wholesale borrowing, and hardly a footbridge
or a box-drain in the whole province has been
built without the assistance of imported capital.
And, in addition to all these evils, the centrali-
sation policy has furnished New South Wales
with about the most infamous system of high-
ways which ever disgraced a civilised land.
The advantages of an efficient Local Govern-
ment Act are sufficiently obvious. It will wipe
out the roads and bridges politician. It will
put an end to the buying of votes with culverts
and pounds. It will relieve Parliament of a
vast amount of useless labour and a vast annual
oatlay. The work required will be better done
by a local authority than by one at a distance.
And for the first time the land will be made to
bear a share of taxation, for the municipali-
ties and shire councils must do out of revenue
the works that have hitherto been done by
loans, and the chief available source of revenue
will be a tax upon land.
* # #
Concerning the One-man-one-vote principle
it is only necessary to say that it has been
already endorsed almost unanimously by the
nation, that both parties in the Legislative
Assembly have given it their support, and that
it would already have been law had not the
fossils of the Council, as usual, barred the way.
i he reason why it should take precedence is
sufficiently apparent. The first step towards
almost all the reforms most urgently wanted is
the establishment of a strong democratic element
in Parliament. The imposition of a land-tax
for the purposes of the general revenue, the
reform or abolition of the Upper House, the
bursting up of the big estates, the absentee tax,
the creation of a new law of inheritance, the
exclusion of Chinese and cheap European
labour, the legalisation of the eight hours
system, the referendum, compulsory insurance,
the creation of a State Bank, Female Suffrage,
the abolition of the nefarious system of Govern-
ment by Contradiction, and many other
measures of the same kind are in want of
immediate attention, but for the time being
they must wait. So long as Parliament
is liable to be packed with the plural
votes of Property they are all about equally
hopeless. The first step towards a democratic
policy is the creation of a democratic Legis-
lature, and manhood suffrage will furnish the
political machine which makes everything else
possible. The attempt to carry any series of
great schemes under the present system will
only lead to a decisive defeat in the Upper
House, a crisis, a dissolution, a general election
in which the new combinations of Capital will
probably undo most of the results obtained at
the polls last year, and the return of an
Assembly which will postpone reform for
perhaps another decade.
* # #
In the matter of tariff reform the Dibbs
Cabinet cannot afford to make delays. It was
sent.into office to establish Protection on a firm
basis, and so far it has only created the first
beginnings of Protection—the reality is yet to
come. The Ministers which went before it
preached Freetrade and lived on Customs duties
with a brazen disregard of all their professions,
but the nation is weary of half-measures, and
of drivel about the thin end of the wedge, and
the time which is not yet “ ripe.” Unless the
Government lacks the courage of its convic-
tions, there is no possible explanation of its
feeble policy—its attempts to sit upon a rail
and to halt between two opinions. As for the
Banking Bill, which, in The Bulletin’s
opinion, is the fourth really urgent measure of
the session, and which seems to be entirely
omitted from the Government programme, it is
wanted chiefly because the Cabinet has com-
mitted a gigantic mistake, and one which
should be remedied at the earliest possible
moment. When the commercial crisis began
last year the Legislature should have established
a system of Government supervision over all
financial institutions, and demanded the invest-
ment of a large proportion of each company’s
alleged funds in State securities as a substantial
protection to its creditors. By so doing it
would have abolished those so-called “ banks
whose condition was absolutely hopeless, and
prevented them preying any longer on the
public, and those which were still solvent might
have been saved from future possibilities of
disaster. But instead of doing this, it set itself
to prop up the whited sepulchres of finance, and
took a hand in the conspiracy by aiding them to
stave off their creditors and postpone the inevit-
able ruin, and in the meantime it furnished
them with facilities for perpetrating other
swindles with almost absolute impunity, ho l '
the reputation of N. 8. Wales it is uecesary to
prove at the earliest possible moment that Par-
liament became the accomplice of a gang of
fraudulent speculators only by reason of its
own inherent stupidity, and not through any
criminal intent, and to do this Lite Government
should take action without any avoidable loss
of time.


Tf the Dibbs Government hopes to justify
’stence it must be content with a com-
its e ( XI , e iY small programme. Hitherto the
P aratl has been to meet the House with
cU tnendous list of measures, and then for
a stU o r six weary months the Legisla-
yoiild flounder heavily on a shoreless sea
U f l6 ners and documents, and everything would
° i If done and nothing finished, and finally
b® “ a elK i 0 f the session a score of uncompleted
nils representing many weeks of weary
•fetation, would drop into the waste paper
y OO , 1 . „ u( j be forgotten. In the present case,
* 5 . aS r oca l Government Bill, the Banking Bill,
l 'd the Tariff Reform scheme, are measures
a i ich can easily be carried through the As-
W 1 |,iy by the solid Protectionist majority, and
reasonably certain to get through
Council. On the One-man-one-vote Bill,
ever, the nominee Chamber will fight to the
hotter end—if it dare, therefore it is imperative
t make it the only seriously debateable
to easure in the session. For, in the first place,
the UpP er House would gladly get rid of this
h ted scheme without openly committing itself
Tlhe chance could be found, and amid a great
' 'essure of unimportant business it might
blandly leave it with the rest of the unfinished
work at the end of the session, and thus drop
't out of sight without a conflict. And,
in the second place, the Lower House is
no t so enthusiastic over the Bill as it
looks, and many members vote for it
with' loathing in their hearts simply because
they must do so or else lose their seats ; there-
fore if the Assembly can get a chance to fool
away the session over Federation or some other
abstract question it might also leave the One-
man-one-vote Bill among the unfinished busi-
liess. And, above all things, Ministers are
unstable at the best, and majorities are fleeting
things, and if the Government attempts a long
and imposing programme it may be defeated on
some small, attenuated side issue. Sir Henry
Parkes fell in this very same ditch only a year
a g o> He intended to go down to history as the
father of the manhood suffrage system in New
South Wales, and he collapsed over a miserable
motion to adjourn the House on a miserable
little question as to whether a miner should
work eight hours a day or whether his time
should be reduced, at his own expense, to seven
hours and sundry odd minutes.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Horrors of Philanthropy.
Dear Bulletin, — It is the curse and degrada-
tion of so-called charity that it is almost always
associated with snuffle and oily piety. This is
not because the pious section of the community
supplies the funds for charitable purposes, but
because it collects the funds—most of them
from the ungodly—and then distributes them
to those of the needy who are ’umble and will
accept religious advice in a subdued spirit. The
average religious society loves begging, and it
loves still more to distribute the proceeds,
because it can thereby sit in state and catechise
the applicant for relief, especially if she is a
crushed and dejected-looking female and is too
miserable to resent the process. It is an
interesting sight to witness six or eight
tough old harridans, dressed in velvet hung
with bugle-beads, inspecting such a person, and
inquiring about her early history, her religious
convictions, how often she attends church, her
morals, how often she has fallen—this point is
always taken up by the fiercest-looking gorgon
with the biggest horn spectacles, the conduct
of her eldest daughter, her views upon eternal
punishment, and the like. If she is correct
upon all these points the six harridans probably
stand up in a row and admonish her sternly
turn-about on the necessity of being provident
and ’umble, and trusting in the Loard, and
working hard ; and they tell her that there is
probably something bad in her past history
which she has concealed ; and then they give
ber a pair of shoddy blankets and an order
for 4s. 6d. in groceries, and let her go. If she
isn’t correct upon all these points, however, the
chief gorgon gives her a blasting address upon
her wickedness, and she doesn’t get any blan-
kets. Many hard, bony females cheerfully give
up a good many hours a day to this business,
and are known as untiring Christian workers,
and all they ask in return is the pleasure of
admonishing about twenty-four broken-down
jeinales per diem. Some of the charities,
however, are run by males, and then an un-
healthy - looking, pasty - faced, clean - shaven
man in a tall, black hat is generally kept
on hand to squash the applicants. I made
16 acquaintance of one victim of this
system the other day. She was a washer-

°fMelh° kbe dead-and-gone Mercantile Bank
gation »° arne, 1 by the “committee of investi-
to land 18 a docoment which assuredly ought
period s T °. ni cbody in a gaol for a lengthened
the “.in,, * • e re P 0 is deliberately untrue,
miittee of investigation ” ought to be
arrested ; if it is true, then there is a yawning
void in a Victorian prison for one or more of
the leading financiers of Melbourne. Accord-
ing to this document, the Mercantile Bank was
broken past redemption as long ago as
December, 1889. The entire cash immediately
available is £199,000, equal to a dividend of
just 2s. 6d. in the £ on the liabilities. Out of
£1,830,000 due to the bank, £835,000 is either
bad or doubtful. More than £659,000, it is
averred, was advanced to companies that had
been floated by Sir M. H. Davies or his co-
directors, and of this amount £512,000 is
practically hopeless ! The dividends were to a
considerable extent bogus, inasmuch as a large
amount of the profits out of which they were
supposed to be paid consisted of interest
which the bank ought to have received,
but didn’t interest charged on its own
bad debts where it now appears that the prin-
cipal and the interest were alike lost in the
bottomless sea of the boom. Among the over-
drafts there are, according to the committee,
some curious items. Several of the bank’s
officials had overdrafts. One director guaranteed
seven separate overdrafts besides his own, and
including all his varied liabilities, owes the
bank nearly £60,000. A concern described as
the “Gascoigne Company,” in which chairman
of directors Sir M. H. Davies is, to put it
mildly, largely interested, owes £66,000. The
Victorian Trust and Agency Cos., the entire
capital of which was only £22,800, borrowed
from the patient and long-suffering Mercantile
no less than £33,145 —and nearly nine-tenths of
the shares in the aforesaid Trust and Agency
Cos. appear to have been owned by Sir M. H,
Davies. These are a few of the more interest-
ing aspects of the Mercantile Bank, yet this
institution wasn’t a bogus bank, in the ordinary
acceptation of the term ; it was understood to
be an orthodox institution conducted on the
best principles of finance. Strangely enough,
there appears even now to be comparatively
little excitement in Melbourne over these and
many other equally ghastly revelations.
Governor Norman (Q.) has, it appears, been
privately advising the British Government that
the Kanaka slave-trade of Queensland is a very
beneficial traffic —that, under the framed regula-
tions, abuses will be of very rare occurrence,
and are certain to be detected whenever perpe-
trated. The opposition to the traffic, he says,
is mainly confined to the clergy and the trades-
unions. Even were it so, the combination of
two such uncongenial elements as the demo-
cratic and progressive unionists and the Tory
and tradition-loving clergy, should be sufficient
to warrant a pause for further examination
into the premises of the question. But it is not
the case. The whole of working white Australia
is opposed to the nigger-kidnapping traffic, the
resumption of which has had its origin with
financial institutions and gambling capitalists,
who have danced over the graves of the ruined
sugar-planters hoodwinked into paying boom
prices for artificially inflated estates. The
moneyed sharks, and those few planters who
were not already absolutely ruined, saw in the
revival of this infamous slave-traffic a chance to
pass over their white elephants to the next lot o 4
fools ; the politicians of the day, nearly all finan-
cially “stiff,” were “ worked,” and the miser-
able Coalition Government of Queensland, glad
to snatch at any financial straw that offered it
a brief respite from artificial, bank-screwed
insolvency, fathered the official iniquity.
M Employment in Queensland is very popular
among the islanders,” says Norman. Perhaps !
The Kanaka’s choice is limited between bullock -
ing for intruding missionaries at home, or
yackering in Queensland for nigger-driving
masters. Give him a wider choice, and he
would prefer to make “ long pig ” of every
white man that set foot on his island. The
Governor’s communication to the British
Government is a bold distortion of facts. The
pen is the pen of Norman, but the words are
the words of the Kanakilgriff.

The Argus quotes a judgment given 13 years
ago by the late Judge Molesworth, in which
he refused to allow a shareholder or debtor of
the insolvent Provincial and Suburban Bank to
have a finger in the liquidation, “ The share-
holders,” said Molesworth, “whether through
complicity in a system of gross fraud, or through
negligence, have allowed the stoppage of this
bank, and the consequent enormous loss and
inconvenience. I will not have any shareholders
for liquidators.” Of a certain liquidator, ap-
pointed at the “voluntary” winding-up meeting
of said bank, good old Molesworth said he
was “an embarrassed man and a debtor to the
bank, and I think him an unfit person, and
would not appoint him even at the wish of a
majority of creditors against a minority.” Times
have changed since then. The infamous Act
passed in Victoria last year gives depositors no
show to prevent directors from liquidating their
own busted banks, and the liquidator of 1892 is
often engaged in trying to escape his indebted-
ness, and cover up the dirty transactions in
which he played a leading part. But the poor
dupes of depositors, and outside shareholders
who were also dupes, simply groan and sigh to
the effect that —where all is rotten, what else
can one expect ?

“ If wheat is taxed,” says Foreign-trade poli-
tician Wise, “the farmers will have to be ruled
by the prices in London.” Would Mr. Wise
kindly explain this statement. On the face of
it, it looks just as reasonable as the assertion
that if a hen has a game leg the price of barbed
wire will be governed by the re-appearance of
Biela’s comet. Whether wheat is taxed or
not nobody will ever import it from London,
and the only time when the London market
camaffect New South Wales is when the New
South Wales farmer begins to export Ins grain
to England. Under Freetrade he had no grain
to export, and not nearly enough for local con-
sumption, therefore the assertion implies, to
begin with, that Protection will increase the
farming industry immensely. Then, if he is
“ ruled by the prices in London,” it only
means that he will sell there and get the money,
and the average price in London is just about
the same as that in Australia anyhow, and even
if it isn’t what difference does it make ? Mr.
W ise doesn’t explain these things ; he evidently
expects his audience to gather, from his tone of
horror, that something dreadful will happen if
the New South Wales wheat-grower is “ ruled ”
by the English market. In which respect he
very much resembles that converted Hindoo
who got his scriptural terms mixed up, and told
his audience that if they didn’t repent they
would be lost and go to heaven for evermore.
The most awkward feature of Russia’s latest
sensational move on the Indian frontier, is that
the occupation by the Muscovite forces of the
Pamir renders nugatory the whole work of
years on the part of the British-Indian military
experts. Disraeli’s “Scientific Frontier on
the West of Hindostan ” has been the founda-
tion of all defence schemes in the Indian Army
Bureau for years past. Every exertion has
been strained to render an invasion of India
via Afghanistan as difficult as possible. The
line of the Hindoo-Koosh has been the backbone
of the scheme, with the Indus for a second line.
Now, the possession of the Pamir plateau abso-
lutely outflanks both those lines of defence,
and, in fact, permits an enemy established there
to take any force operating on these lines in
the rear, and to cut them off from their com-
munications, as provided by the strategical lines
of railway from the Bengal Presidency. Students
of great campaigns will not fail to be struck by
the extraordinary similarity which would ensue
between the position of forces in that campaign
of Napoleon’s which culminated at Marengo,
and the positions which would be held respec-
tively by a British army operating to resist an
apparent attack from the line of Afghanistan,
and a Russian army descending from the Pamir
steppes in their rear, as Napoleon defiled from
the Alps on the rear of Baron Melas. But
this very similarity helps to the conviction that
the hour of definite catastrophe is not yet.
Russia has no army on the Pamirs, nor near
enough to be of predominating or adequate
strength in descending into the open. She can
wait, and may wait, unless, indeed, the revolted
tribes of Afghanistan are worth trying against
England as a broom to sweep a way for a
regular army.
It seems very doubtful indeed whether even
the newspaper-reading upper and middle-classes
of Great Britain have any real conception as to
what may be the actual political opinions of
the working and the pauperised millions who
constitute the bulk of the population of the
United Kingdom. With the single exception
of Reynolds’ Newspaper (which, it is cabled,
fiercely denounces the Gladstone Government
as a mere bourgeois gang), the press is run
by middle-class conductors, and their senti-
ments adapted to secure the concurrence either
of the aristocracy or, more commonly, of the
income-drawing, and of the trading classes.
The numbers of the former class—which like-
wise is numerous in France, and in that country
has a specific designation, rentiers —is scarcely
conceivable to people in Australia, where
nearly everyone does something for a living.
The introduction to the House of Commons,
consequent on the general election just over, of
several of the operative class may be destined
to open the eyes of the classes in Great Britain
in a very startling fashion. There have been
one or two labour-members in that House
before. Joseph Arch and Burt were labour-
members. But Arch was a clodhopper from
the agricultural districts, and his ideas dated
nearly twenty years back, when Hodge still
trembled at his own audacity in having voted
otherwise than the squire and the parson
ordained. And, besides, the Hodge who voted
was not the common field variety of Hodge,
but a special, select variety, sorted out by a
restricted suffrage. Now, however, we have
intelligent and forceful not to say doughty
representatives of the organised body of
labourers—of the coal-hewer, and so forth,
And, as one sign of the times, a labour-member
for a metropolitan constituency is escorted to
the House of Commons by a crowd singing the
“Marseillaise,” and takes his place in the
Chamber wearing a tricolour scarf. This looks
like a rattling among the dry bones of ancient
monarchy.
The Twentieth Century offers the following
suggestion as an amendment on the U.S. Con-
stitution :
Whereas, the dogmatic Church of this country is the
most prominent and determined supporter of the doc-
trine of capital punishment; and, whereas, the ministers
of the said Church are in the habit of granting absolution
for all sins to those who are condemned to be hanged, and
assuring those who are repentant of their certainty of
comfortable quarters in the world to come, while denying
them even a solitary, unfurnished cell below. Now, be it
enacted, by us, the people, that hereafter all persons who
are condemned to death by the law shall be openly exe-
cuted by a minister of one of the said churches, who shall
be chosen by lot from among the 50 leading preachers in
the state in which the execution is to be held, in the same
manner as is now provided by law for the choice of jurors
in civil cases. The said minister should attend to the
spiritual needs of the prisoner; and, after assuring him
of the forgiveness of God, which is denied by man, shall
openly and publicly cut the rope or turn on the cur-
rent which causes death. The name of the clerical
hangman shall be furnished to the press not less than
two weeks before the time fixed for the execution ;
and he shall be required, on the Sunday preceding the
ceremony, to preach to his congregation a sermon on the
merits of capital punishment. Refusal on the part of a
minister to act as hangman shall be punished by a line of
not less than SSOOO and one year’s imprisonment at
solitary confinement, with no book to read save the Holy
Bible. If anyone shall hoot, or throw things at a Chris-
tian clergyman who shall, under the preceding sections,
hang a repentant sinner, he shall be punished by being
declared a non-conformist.
This is good so far as it goes, but why should
the Christian preacher have the monopoly of
the hanging? Why shouldn’t the “respect-
able ” editor also tail on to the rope, and the
proprietor of the moral organ which always
gives its enthusiastic support to the gallows?
Dear Bulletin, —There seems small difference
between the face-grinding powers of such
employers as dispose of a large capital and
those of employers who have no capital at all.
Everybody knows that two millstones are
required for the process of grinding, but few
seem to see that the land-speculating and rent-
exacting landlord acts as the nether millstone.
Remove the latter and the downward move-
ment of the upper one will only result in a
rapid scattering of the grain beyond its reach.
Now, the workers cannot escape from the grip
of the two millstones. Laws forbid or make it
almost impossible for them to camp outside of
other people’s property ; as soon as they settle,
on private ground the necessity of providing
for the payment of rent forces them to compete
with others for the chances of earning a
pittance. They expose themselves to having
their faces ground, and every success on their
part in raising the rate of wages has imme-
diately raised rents. If, however, anyone loses
his employment the rents at the increased rate
remain still to be paid. Even now, in Australia,
after many months of stagnation of trade, rents
have receded only in a very few instances,
while the industry of the tenant has in the
previous prosperous times been taxed to the
utmost by landlords who did nothing to assist
that industry. Most rents are still at the
full land-boom pitch, although the bank crash
has proved so many valuations to be exorbitant
and unattainable. When shall we hear of a
concerted action of all workers against the
nether millstone? If the toilei'S only will it
unanimously the land must be wilhd, awn
from the list of articles whose price and use
can be made a matter of wild speculation.—

Australia is, so far as we know, the only
country on earth where a number of alleged
inhabitants continually write to the papers,
urging the immediate importation of niggers,
Chinamen, murderous Malays, Kanakas,
Javanese, idolators, lepers, paupers, diseased
persons and idiots, in order to fill up the
country and leave the coming generations of
Australians landless outcasts in their own
continent. The latest maudlin scribe of this des-
cription is a person who signs himself “Citizen,”
and who is permitted to write in the S.M.
Herald as follows :
There are thousands of Eurasians who have no plane in
India, being- disowned by the English and Hindoos al'ke.
Could not these people, who can endure tropical heat, be
induced to settle in this part of Australia? They are
allied tons by blood, and they would be the ancestors of
a people who would be no more dissimilar from us than
are the inhabitants of Sicily from the people of Lombardy.
The Eurasian is the illegitimate son of the boss
Briton in India—the son of a European and of
the Asiatic girl whom he seduced ; and he has
no place in his own land because his father is
too mean to acknowledge him, and his mother’s
race objects to him on general principles. And
because the white man in India won’t recognise
his own son, therefore Australia is,to take him
in, and “ Citizen ” wants to establish a colony
of bastards—it is a brutal word, but it just
expresses the situation—in the Northern Terri-
tory, and these persons are to be our parti-
coloured ancestors—it is a novel idea, that of
importing ready-made ancestors, but that is a
mere side issue. Further, “Citizen” goes
on to explain that he wants to do this
because of the Chinamen who now infest
the North—that is to say, we have got the
Chow, therefore we are to have the nigger also—
which is much the same as saying that when a
man has gout he must immed : ately get
leprosy as well. Now that the Eurasian idea
has been worked up, The Bulletin can’t
remember any broken-down or objectionable
aborigine—barring the Red Indian—who hasn’t
been mentioned at one time or another as a
person who ought to come to Australia, and
have land given him for nothing at the expense
of the community. Probably the Red Indian
has been suggested at some time or other as a
promising colonist, but we have forgotten him.
An impertinent correspondent of the Eastern
Districts Chronicle (VV.A.) wants to know
whether the two bullock-drivers who recently
flogged the blackfellows with wattle-sticks in
the N.W. of the youngest Australian province,
and the two Js.P. who looked on at the
execution of their own sentence (commented
upon in late issues of The Bulletin) don’t
come within the following clause of the Police
Act, 1892 (W.A.)
Every person who shall wantonly or cruelly beat,
illtreat, overload, overdrive, abuse, or torture, or cause or
procure to be wantonly or cruelly beaten, illtreated, over-
loaded, overdriven, abused, or tortured, or shall omit to
supply with sufficient food or water, any living thing,
shall, on conviction, be liable to a penalty of ten pounds,
or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three
calendar months with or without hard labour.
This impertinent correspondent wants to know
if an Australian aboriginal is a “ living thing.”
Such a querist has no proper respect for the
Bench, but when he was about it he might also
have inquired whether the Government which
refuses relief to an unemployed citizen doesn’t
come under the same Act, for its neglect to
‘ ‘ supply with sufficient food and water ” a
living inhabitant.
The English Consul, at Cadiz, is reckoned
one of the best wine-experts in Portugal. They
tried him lately with two magnificent sherries,
and he couldn’t award the palm to either. One
was <£50 a butt, while the other was a purely
artificial wine, saleable at 4|d. a quart!
A year or two ago, when the Atkinson
(M.L.) Government was on the down grade, it
started to distribute every possible billet among
its friends and hangers-on, and among the rest it
appointed a sixth Judge of the Supreme Court,
whereas the law only allowed for five. One of the
existing Judges, however, was aged and shaky,
and the Atkinson Cabinet, by its new appoint-
ment, practically gave away his billet in advance,
so that the hated Ballance might not have the
office to dispose of when the old man died. But
the old Judge wouldn’t die, and the Law Officers
decided that there was no authority to pay the
salary of the extra man, so Atkinson tried to pass
a special grant for him among the Supplementary
Estimates — and failed. Then the Ballance
Cabinet came in and declined to recognise
Judge Edwards, and as he positively refused
to resign, he was simply allowed to go on
sending people to gaol without any salary. When
he got tired of this he sued for his alleged arrears
of screw, and tire Supreme Court decided that he
wasn’t a legally authorised Judge, and that there
was nothing due to him. Next, lie appealed to the
Privy Council and was defeated there ako; and,
after that, he stepped down and went back to the
bar, and tried to take up his forsaken practice.
And now Mr. Edwards, as a stone-broke lawyer,,
appeals to Parliament for relief ; and, meanwhile,
everybody whom he has sent to gaol demands
immediate release, on the ground that he was
unlawfully sentenced by an unauthorised Judge,
and everybody who got a divorce from him and
married again has an awful suspicion about
bigamy, and the people whom he ordered to pay
costs want the costs returned, a .d all is confusion
and horror.


In answer to many enquiries—Samuell’s
popular Musical Album is published at one
shilling, and may be obtained from any large
music or book store, or from the wholesale agents
Messrs. Robert A. Thompson and Co. of 7!>
Market-street, Sydney, and Melbourne. For one
shilling and three pence it will be posted. It
contains a new pianoforte piece, by Horace
Poussard, a set of waltzes, by A. W. Juncker, a
new set of lancers, and eight good songs each of
which has been published in America at four
shillings each. It is full music size, clearly and
boldly printed, and has a good portrait of Miss
Marion Hood on the cover. It is, without a
doubt, the largest shilling’s worth of music ever
published in Australia. All this week Paling’s
have been very busy with customers asking for
Samuell’s Popular Musical Album.*

GIC Macquarie-street North, Sydney, August 24,1892.
My Dkar Moorabinba, —
The ways of the itinerant plutocrat are sometimes in-
teresting. One festive youth who yachted out to Austra-
lia from “ home ” with his wife not so long ago brought
12 dozen shirts for wearing on the voyage, and his bride
packed a new dress for every day ! Going back they went
by a P. & 0,, and rumour hath it that the gentleman was
the cause of the disappearance of every bottle of fizz on
the ship before she had got to Albany !
f (You could track this youth all over Australia by the
dead marines in his wake. The story goes that while
doing Maoriland, a trip was got up to a distant peak
where there w T as only an uncivilised sort of hostelry which
didn’t run to fancy tipples, and somebody told him that
he would have to go without champagne at least. But a
coach loaded with extra sec. followed the other vehicles
to the very pinnacle.
A new beauty industry, sure to be of special interest to
the muffin-faced Australienne (who is more often skinned
like a frost-bitten lemon than not), has started into life in
Sydney Strand. I needn’t be more explicit as to the
whereabouts—a sympathetic lift boy guides you (if you
are a lady) to the holy spot without explanation. At
least he guided me. “Madame Ruppert, ain’t it?’’ he
said encouragingly—and didn’t I feel flattered !
Madame Ruppert (Sydney representative. Miss Robin-
son) claims to have discovered a skin-tonic of a perfectly
harmless description that removes the patient’s powder-
drenched and rouge-soddened outer cuticle and sends her
forth blushing in an epidermis like the skin of a last
week’s baby. Three bottles of the wash, it is averred,
turn you into a damask rose for the rest of your days.
The tonic (Midame’s main attraction) comes'wrappcd in
testimonials and seems to have left a trail of beauties
wherever it has been uncorked. Yet it is passing strange
that the lady-agent presses its virtues on a blotched public
enveloped (I moan the agent is) in a four-fly gossamer
veil. VVe want to bo lured on to change our spots by
somebody with a sample cheek, don’t you know.
By the way, in the Strand, on the floor below the com-
plexion-specialist, Sydney’s matrimonial bureau is dis-
covered. Isn’t this the wrong way about ? Oughtn’t the
complexion-cure to come before the spinster-cure?
I was glad to see a colossal crowd grasping at the chance
to hear Cuttica et cie for a shilling in Centennial Hall, the
other Friday. The popular artists (in Adelaide there was
a regular riot on their last appearance ; La Cuttica threw
her bouquet piece-meal among the crowd, and a big
trombone secured a kissed rose for which he was vainly
offered fabulous prices) have lots of room to let them-
selves go in, and the programme is always operatic. The
night I was there, Madame C., in a black gown and black
gloves (a singing woman is a fool to ever wear ’em white
—they make the arms as red as carrots), scored largely in
the “ Polacca ” from Mignon, and in a “ Rigolelto ” duet
with her sposa—who is still lifting his cymbal-sounding
tenor with both shoulders and hurling it into space. Why
don’t all artists comprehend that singing is melody, not
force? If vigour carried the day the next prima-donna
would probably be a bull.
The Italians are a graceful if olive-oily race—every
man Jack of them is politer than a shop-walker. At the
concert when Sisco and Travaglini finished their charming
duet from “ Puritani,” and the audience howled at
’em, they both shook hands with Mdlle. Krakowski, who
had contributed a very helpful accompaniment. The
English-speaking warbler nearly backs over the pianiste,
and then turns and flees down the exit, leaving her to
get off anyhow, as a general thing. And, as for including
her in the mob-raptures !—I can’t imagine him at it, can
you?
They put up the “ Mikado ” at Her Majesty’s for a fitful
one night and a morning show last week, with a leading
lady who ought to have been addressed as Gum-Gum, and
a tenor whose upper register was apparently out of town.
But everything else—gorgeous costumes included—was
lovely, especially the new Jack o’ Lantern baritone, Allan
Morris, as the Mikado—the very best we’ve ever had, to
my way of thinking. He was tall and bambooish and
painted like a death’s-head, and the cruelty of his flesh-
less grin and audibility of his correctly-traincd voice
made one regret that the Mikado has such a little part.
The Japanese opera, by the way, isn’t a happy hunting-
ground for the beautiful he-actor—Ryley’s nmke-up as
Pooh-Bah, for instance. Just like a Joss—but somebody
viewing the Ryley with his speaking visage painted in
furrows cruelly whispered “ As he will be 1”
Operas spring up like Jack-in-the-box at Her Majesty’s
theatre now o’ nights, and it’s quite a mystery why we
haven’t had Howard Vernon straying out as “ Ko-Ko” in
the middle of “The Old Guard,” put up on Saturday.
Mr. Vernon, who ought to be known as the handkerchief-
actor, had a part that gave him full scope to flip his lace-
edged mouchoir in the breeze, in his airy “ go away, you
giddy little thing ” manner, and the audience felt at home
at once.
It was a sort of operatic patchwork at Her Majesty’s
last week, and last Thursday’s patch was “ Yeomen of the
Guard,” when a large and full-frocked house turned up, al-
though one hid to skip across a weeping pavement to get in.
An animated flirtation, carried on round a d.c. pillar by a
gorgeously-frocked lady and a fascinating politician, was
one of the interests of the o.p. side; and one of our
prettiest girls was put where everybody could see her,
fortunately.
The Yeoman is a depressed individual to sit out on a
rainy night, and most of his humour is unpremeditated.
For instance, quite a wide and fin-de-siecle smile went
round when Bracy—hOw soothing is his sweet and
monotonous tenor seemed to say that he would make a
••good, unloving husband.” Nobody bad any very
startling clothes-changes—except when Elsie (Flora
Graupner, who did it prettily, but her voice wants a rest)
altered to the usual eccentric white satin garment reach-
ing to her garters, which is what the operatic bride always
makes an exhibition of herself in on her wedding-day.
Pretty Violet Varley (what fiddlesticks to say she
imitates Nellie Stewart!) cut a ship-shape little figure as
Phoebe, but her chirpy voice and antics struck me as being
too comic-operatish for the Gilbert and Sullivan dirge.
You are not supposed to laugh at the “ Yeomen of the
Guard.” It is meant do be a very serious and solemn
composition—isn’t there a professional jester in it?
“ The Old Guard ” is a lively rattlepate show full of
extravagant colour and pipeclayed legs, but it’s a regular
man’s opera all the same, and women—who can’t be ex-
pected to shriek rapturously at the imaginary shaving-scene
and bar-scene, which are distinctly of male interest only—
yawn a little now and then and wonder why there isn’t
more—er —Ryley in the recipe ! The dresses make the
stage look like a costume ball or a tobacco advt., and
people who smoke cigarettes have a vague memory of
having got a presentment of every one of the white-
legged officers, from May Pollard downwards, with their
bundles of sixpenny smokes from time to time.
Somebody is evidently of Katisha’s opinion that a
maiden’s all the better when she’s tough—judging by this
Sydney ad.
L^HAPERONES. —Independent gentleman (forty-
nine, highly connected), good home, seeks intro-
duction eligible parti with means, not under thirty;
No objection to widow. Chevalier, Daily Telegraph.
“ Chaperones ” is a wily bait, and shows a comprehension
of the connubial instincts of some varieties of the species
that is almost genius. For it’s only the foolish damsel on
a husband-hunt who lets herself be guarded from con.
servatory dangers by a widow. The only safe duenna is a
woman of fifty or so, with a real, live husband to keen her
from scooping her frock out fore-and-aft, and dangling
her programme in an inviting way while her charge mopes
under a gas-bracket.
It would interest some people to know how a man may
protect himself from the affection of his emotional
acquaintances who individually insist upon being his
darling without consulting him in the matter? In a
society divorce-case which is on the tapestry, it’s
rumoured that the co-respondent has always con-
temptuously torn up the respondent’s billets-doux and
trampled on conservatory tributes from the same source—
and yet the end is a decree-nm chase !
“A poor dressmaker” writes to a Sydney daily to say
that all the relief goes to “ idle men who don’t want work,
and nobody helps the poor sewers who stitch for 3s. a
day and keep themselves. “ I used to get 4s. a day, but
have now been cat down to 2s. fid.” This reveals a sad
state of affairs, and “Poor Dressmaker” wonders why
nobody helps her.
The wail of the underpaid needle-plyer reminds me of
the Young Women’s Christian Association, which re-
capitulated its modus operandi the other day. One of its
acts of vigilance is to send somebody to meet all incoming
long-distance trains and vessels to see if there are friend-
less young women on board. “And altho’,” naively reads
the report, “ help may not be needed at first, it often
happens that young women are glad of it later on.”
But nobody will help her except in a spasm of charity
that does no permanent good. Before the hard-working
sewing-girl can hope for a fair reward for her labours the
world of women must agree to boycott “gift sales,” and
“ bargain counters,” and “sacrifices” where blouses at
11 id., and under-linen at not 2s. the article are snapped
in by scores of economists who wouldn’t probably be very
distressed even if they realized that they had virtually
taken the money they’ve “saved” out of some starving
woman’s pocket. The shop-keepers who lower their
prices aren’t so much to blame as the conscienceless,
greedy people who encourage them. For if one reduces
his wares the other must follow suit, unless they’re keep-
ing shops simply “for their health.” Bargain-hungry
woman is the worst enemy of “Poor Dressmaker” and her
class—and don’t let her dare to think otherwise.
The idea of meeting young girls strange to the ways of
the city is very commendable, but from what I hear of the
Y.W.C.A. it’s too obstinately pious to do much good to
any young woman with more “spunk” in her than a
sparrow. There is too much old-maidish severity and
little hymn-book in their philosophy, for one thing.
Because a girl happens to be a stranger in a strange land
is no earthly reason why she should have to go through
oceans of religious exercises to justify her being plucked
like a brand from the burning. The method of the
Y.W.C.A. reminds you of the old joke about the man and
the mustard—only it’s the prayer-book they try to force.
Mr. George Reid, M.P., after playing a sort of matri-
monial snap-dragon for many years, has at last fished out
a raisin—to follow out the metaphor to its bitter end—
and the N.S.W. Opposition wanted to give him a picnic
to celebrate his dual state the other day. Mr. Reid
declined the proposed compliment to himself and his
bride. And this is the way deserving politicians are for
ever being baulked in their attempt} to give everybody a
happy day 1
The ball in aid of the building-fund of the Boys’
Brigade is to eventuate on 27th September, in Sydney
Town Hall, in the presence of Lord and Lady Jersey,
Chief Justice and Lady Darley, and the members of
the Brigade committee. The sterling object of the
Brigade-the rescue of boys from the dirty streets—
ought to commend the ball to a discriminating public and
a large attendance is sure to result. During the evening
the inevitable minuet in Watteau costume will be danced
by a bevy of young ladies. Mrs. A. A. Kircaldie, Home-
bush, is lion. sec. and tickets are 12s. fid. which seems to
be the fixed figure nowadays.
A leading feature in that festive farce, “The Judge”
(put up by the Kemble Co. at Sydney Opera House last
Saturday) was the airy and unconscious way all the
characters ignored the idea of going to bed in the second
act. When two young ladies come back from a dance in
the wee’ sma’ ’oors it isn’t usual for them to entertain
their escorts to the extent of showing them the flowers in
the conservatory. The two girls, Chloe and Daphne Pye
(played by Miss K., who arranged all the “business”
herself—and Mrs. Molyneux) sported all the drapery in
the piece, unless the fatal effects of starch observable
about the person of Harry Jewett came under the heading
of le dernier mot de la Monde. I liked Myra Kemble (not
many manageresses would take the smallest part in the
cast, as shedid in “The Judge”) exceedingly in a white
frock trimmed with bands of electric-grey covered with
white lace ; and, of course, Mrs. Molyneux looked charm-
ing in her favourite colour, pink.
By the way, aren’t they giving people too many stage
babies at the—aw—lmperial Opera House? Is the glass-
eyed management testing the public with a view to alter-
ing the premises into a baby-farm ?
Every second production at the York-strect Theatre
centres round an unconvincing rag-doll in a frilled cap
and sometimes even the star-actors are forced to stand at
the wings and squall when Ibis obviously fictitious
che-yild is marked “ fractious ” in the stage business.
Personally I prefer the stalled to the real stage-infant—it
doesn’t get on the stump for one thing—but one rag baby
in every hundredth play is about as many as a possibly
envious spinster can put up with. A farce in which the
raison d’etre is a sawdust Moloch and the principal
situation carefully leads up to a feeding-bottle, is not
what one hankers for in every change of bill.
O.ie overhears queer conversations sometimes
especially at bops, where the revealed charms of the
maid generally lead to more or loss personal compliment
on the part of the merry man. This was really eaves-
dropped the other evening, wafted from one of those half-
lit cushioned recesses that are sometimes more fun than
waltzing. “I don’t believe you,” a man’s voice \vas
meditatively replying, “judging from the shape of your
arm you should have a very good”—well 1 will say
“ ankle!”

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Her Majesty’s “Pepita.”
Garrick “ Alabama Minstrels."
MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Princess's “ The Silver King.”
Bijou “Confusion.”
Alexandra Dramatic Company.
Apparently the glory of the “Mikado”
has mostly departed, for that opera ran just
one consecutive night and part of the following
day at Her Majesty’s (Sydney). The most con-
spicuous novelty in the revival was the appearance
of Allan Morris as the Japanese autocrat, and
this gentleman proved on inspection to be a
remarkably humorous monarch with a clear,
melodious voice, a diabolical laugh which fetched
the gallery every time, and an active pair of feet.
The fatally beautiful Ryley—whose legs, to judge
by the results of many other such legs in the past,
may yet bring him into trouble and be the cause
of his undoing—was a glittering vision as Pooh-
Bah, and Howard Vernon constructed for himself
a remembersome executioner. Two more nights
were filled by the “Yeomen of the Guard,” an
opera which is just too serious to be comic and not
quite solemn enough to be serious ; and on Satur-
day night the “Old Guard” was put up in the
sure and certain hope that it will last through the
week, and that a crowded house will shriek for
more and more of the Hn-de-siedc ballet every night.
There is an advanced leg-show element in this
little performance, and when it reaches that point
where the four fairies in skirts whirl round
together, each one holding up at a considerable
elevation the foot of the fairy in front of her, the
joy has to be removed in drays. There is nothing
of a very striking character about the songs in
the “Old Guard,” and the plot is based on a con-
fiscated marquis whose daughter had been
exchanged for a peasant girl in infancy, and who
changes her back again in order to dish an upstart
captain who is ordered to marry her per imperial
decree, and then changes her once more on
hearing that the captain is a disguised nobleman,
and afterwards tears his hair on discovering,
when it is too late, that the captain has
also been changed, and, instead of being a noble-
man, is only the same common upstart as before,
but is comforted on learning from the Mayor—who
has been changed for a grenadier—that, owing to
the original exchange, the captain has got the
peasant girl after all. Thereupon he hunts up the
real daughter and the real nobleman, and bestows
them on each other.

There are more good acting parts in the
“Old Guard ” than in almost any other opera we
know of the same dimensions. In the first place,
there is a particularly howlsome character for
George Lauri as the Mayor, and even Elton could
hardly be funnier without breaking his lamented
neck. Also, Lauri is much more melodious than
the Bill who is gone before, who—say it low—sang
at times as tunefully as a bag of indignant
cats, Howard Vernon makes the Marquis as
eccentric as anyone dare make a nobleman of
the old regime, and floats round with his inevi-
table handkerchief in his hand all the time,
Ryley, in a tight blue coat with yellow
facings and a yearning expression, represents the
Captain minus his usual airy skip, but then a man
might as well try to skip in chains with lewt. of
coal as in an Imperial uniform. Flora Graupner
looks enchanting in vivandiere costume, and
makes love in a particularly hugful manner to
Violet Varley, in a military uniform and a brass
trumpet cut bias. Also Florence Young sings her
way through a good part rather sweetly, and Ida
Osborne, adorned with an enlarged season ticket
hanging at the end of a ribbon, does the same,
only very much more so. A lot more jam and
much gorgeous scenery and military music are un-
avoidably crowded out.

At Sydney Garrick, on a wet night and
away up a slushy street, amid an atmosphere of
clogs and damp umbrellas, the “Really Most
Remarkable Minstrel Organisation in the World,”
as per its own advertisement, commenced
business. This organisation is known as the
“Alabama Minstrels,” and it includes George
Wood and the “great, the only, the incompar-
able” Billy Emerson as its leading feature. It is
difficult to raise much enthusiasm in this age of
mud and horror about the ancient art of the
nigger serenader, and the wide mouth of the
corner-man, and the conundrums of the artist with
the hones, and the hidden insults which he heaves
at “Mr. Johnson,” and the fearsome laugh of the
person with the tambourine, and the break-down
and the clog-dance and the rest of the business ;
but the conundrums in the present instance arc
fresher than some we have heard, and the
mouth of the corner man is up to the regulation
size, and sundry amusing sketches adorn the
programme.

“The Judge,” who lately rose on the
horizon at Sydney Opera House, is a somewhat
badly-constructed legal functionary who looks
well on the surface, but Won't bear much inspec-
tion. The author’s trouble evidently arose out of
the fact that he had a number of hilarious situa-
tions ready for the principal character to fall into,
but didn’t know how to get him into them with
any reasonable show of probability. “ The
Judge,” however, possesses at least one decidedly
original feature : it is thje .pnly comedy wo remem-
ber wherein a public' officer appears partly
undressed in a tub of hot water. He isn’t ,
undressed, of course; so that there is '
cause for alarm. Apart from this unC-Li^ 1
spectacle, the trouble arises chiefly through a hd°*
who is awaiting her trial for bigamy ”b™- 1 • y ’
gaol and taking refuge with her inf ’ Cll .'«
the Judge’s house, where, through shee/aS
ancc and superhuman gall, she rushes tb
miserable dignitary into passing her ,v
as his wife, and singing “ ketch.Aetohy ” m
the infant. Also, Hie makes the entire household
fly round at 4 a.m. and warm the off ~: I
feeding-bottle, and turns the house upside dmv*
in search of a sweet biscuit, and causes the i, '
two daughters to trot on little
small monstrosity. Apart from the way this iron
shod female tramples over the poor miser‘bm
iveu-asotajudp. ttay h.l ...id, i„’ ’
Ihe other two husbands turn up, of course and
one of them pursues the judge with a rake and
when that distracted old man takes refuse in th
cellar, a bag of coals is empried on his grey hairs
Also, the two daughters aforementioned are loved
by two young barristers, who seriously consider
the advisability of running each other 100 yards
to decide which will have the first choice, and who
finite naturally wake the judge at 5 a.m to a 1-
Ins consent; and everything ends with a grand
procession of judges, barristers, daughters police
men, infants, and miscellaneous husbands.’ Some
excellent acting is done by Miss Myra Kembb.
and Mrs. Molyneux as the two daughters and
Mr, Edwin Kelly does the judge in really’high
class style. Mr. A. R. Lawrence leaves a
suddenmg effect behind him as the husband with
the rake, and the bigamous person who swarms in
through the window is done by Miss Annie
Taylor in a massive stylo which partly accounts
for the legal functionary’s awful breaking up
The programme sets forth that the piece is pro-
duced by arrangement with Bill Holloway, Esq.
Without being too censorious, and makin" duo
allowance for all its hilarious features” Bill
Holloway seems a very suitable person to’make
arrangements with in such a case.

The Italian Opera Co.’s slii ling concerts
continue to do extensive business at Sydney
Centennial Hall, and Miss Bessie Hoyle
our own violiniste, has now been added to the
company, and is thrown in without any extra
charge whatever. The Gettysburg Cyeloraina
still prospers to a reasonable extent. John F.
Sheridan’s benefit came off with eclat at the
Garrick, and H. R. Jewett will farewell at the
same house on a scale of great magnificence next
Monday (August 2.4). Concerts are going on at
Bondi and Coogee Aquariums, and at the Dar-
linglmrst Rink, where Gracie Whiteford is making
a final appearance before departing for the land of
the wooden ham and the artificial egg. Signoi
Bosco performs miracles at the Royal Standard
every Sunday, including the “Great Metempsy-
chosis, or Transmigration of the Spirit,” which,
if the fact is only half as largo as the announce-
ment, should be a tremendous episode. Also,
Daniel Tracey holds the fort at the Gaiety, and
sees the mighty host advancing every night at the
usual moderate figure.
Bland Holt ran “ A Sailor’s Knot ” at
Adelaide Royal for ten nights, afterwards staging
“ The Trumpet Call.” The desert of dress-circle
lias shown but few oases throughout the season,
but other parts of the house have been well patro-
nised by admirers of gore and glory.
Melbourne Princess’s was loaded to the
muzzle on Saturday night. The people who, after
hardening their hearts, against Italian opera, had
stayed away from “ A Midsummer Night’s
Dream ” and left George Rignold lamenting for
seven weeks, now came back in their thousands to
worship “The Silver King.” It is seldom that a
piece containing no legs or music attracts a
gigantic audience in modern Melbourne. The
circumstance calls for explanation, inasmuch as a
previous revival of the drama at the same house,
with the original Titheradge, Elton, and other
strong favourites in the bill —to say nothing of two
later reproductions at the Royal—didn’t excite so
much interest. Possibly the history of a hopeless
insolvent who becomes fabulously rich between
the second and third acts fills a general want.
Perhaps they expected “ Silver King ” to make a
few remarks on the strike at Broken Hill. Any-
way the theatre was crowded, and a long drawn-
out performance was reverently received.

Walter Bentley, in the name-part, comes
out strong at times, but is decidedly wanting in
romantic interest. As a drunken reprobate lie
seems a more hopeless juggins than the text
requires him to appear, and it has ever been hard
to feel sorry for a fellow who ruins himself in the
traditional “Derby suit” of a tailor’s fashion-
plate, and then tries to drown his sorrow in an
obscure skittle-alley. Bentley sobers up vigor-
ously, though not in a specially artistic manner,
and is effective in his big speeches, such as the
Joshuatic request to have the sun pit bade -
hours, and the story of the Hand that reaches
clown from Heaven and grabs him in Ins dreams.
For the rest his penitence is parsonic. He come,
back to “the old home” (for even this drama
couldn’t dispense with an old home) like
shaky shepherd in search of a subscripts .
Moreover, he is an ancient ruin, a sort of luima
country church crumbling in decay, instead or
experienced young man from Nevada, bleac .
and cleaned by remorse. Bentley’s earnes - ■
commends him to the audience all the same. •*.

o Confusion,” last seen in Melbourne
seven years ago, came out almost like a novelty at
the Bijou on Saturday. This is the carefully-
jnixed-up comedy in which some parties talk about
p U g dawg to other parties who think the con-
versation refers to a baby, whilst those imme-
diately interested in the baby are understood to
be always harping on the pug. The mistaken
ideas that clash during the wild cax-eer of “Con-
fusion ” are kept burning by a maiden aunt, who
attributes the baby to a bachelor uncle, but thinks
lie must have received vast encouragement before
be dared to go so far. A young wife is also sus-
pected of the infant by a husband evidently inex-
perienced in Nature’s ways, whilst the lawful
progenitor, expecting to find his offspring in a
cabinet, reels under a ghastly inference that the
( ] o rr has eaten his family and swallowed the bones.
The B. and 13. company let themselves out so far as
they can discreetly go in this spicy entertainment,
and the result is one long burst of innocent
laughter tempered by a becoming blush. “ Con-
fusion,” it appears, was specially selected to har-
monise with the Agricultural Show. Its humour
could be grasped by a prize heifer and enjoyed by
any intelligent horse. Cecil Ward, Miss Homer,
Brough, Boucicault, Mrs. Brough and MissLeston
do most of the work. Miss Temple, Cannam and
Chichester are likewise connected with the out-
break, and the latter deserves honorable mention
for his white flannel pants, which have been be f ore

The Bulletin the other day received the prospectus of
a concern described as the “Victorian Amateur Competi-
tors’ Association,” the object of which is to “promote
interest in literary pursuits ”—in other words, the asso-
ciation proposes to raise a new crop of rejected
contributors to haunt the editor’s door and harry
the weary sub-editor with impossible poems and
agonising romances. Governor Hopetoun and Sir M.
11. Davies are among the patrons, and Zox, of the
copious white wastcoat, is secretary. Every person
wishing to read one of his own poems, or speak an original
oration, or elocute or warble or paw ivory in the
presence of an admiring association must pay Is.
Anybody wishing to come and listen to the horror
must pay Is. for a front seat or (id. for a back
one. Governor Hopetoun, with an insane desire to
make himself agreeable, offers a prize of one guinea for
the beat poem on “ A Bush Burial ’’—that good old bush
burial that nobody ever hears the last of. The committee
consists principally of V. Levy and Joseph Blascheck—
this name isn’t to be pronounced “ Blast-cheek ” on any
account. There is no prize for digging, or cabbage-rear-
ing, or drainage, or anything useful—nothing but the
bush burial and things like that. Where the competitors’
shillings go to is not stated ; possibly Sir M. 11. Davies
puts them in the bank and has ’em reported on after

The Australian Banking Co. (Sydney) depositors
have decided, by 87 votes to 85, that it is unnecessary to
appoint a third liquidator. Perhaps three liquidators
aren’t needed; but are the present pair the best who
could have been selected under the circumstances? Tub
Bulletin understands that Mr. Bull and Mr. Kidd are
both shareholders in the bank, which may yet be declared
to be of unlimited liability. It is also understood that a
near relative of Mr. Bull’s is reputedly the most solid per-
son on the bank’s share-list, and would be looked to for
colossal contributions in the event of the Courts deciding
that the w'reckcd hank was an unlimited concern. No
imputation on Mr. Bull is hereby intended —but he is in
an unduly delicate position.

Dear Bulletin, —The craze for liquidation of
mines threatens to become epidemic. First came the
wild cats with no lodes ; now the div.-paying mines take
their turn. In April, ’92, the shareholders of Brcken Hill
Central mine were assured that the finances of their Co.
were thoroughly sound, and a div. was paid ; four months
later it suddenly appears that the mine is bankrupt-
liquidation and reconstruction required to get out of
the difficulties, and very doubtful at that. And a
few days ago the shareholders of the Nymagee Copper-
mining Co. unexpectedly found themselves in a similar
position. This mine is one of the very few which have
returned their nominal capilal in divs., and it has had the
amplest opportunities to establish a substantial reserve-
fund for the time when such a notoriously fluctuating
metal as copper temporarily sells at a non-payable price.
But as soon as expenses exceed the earnings by a mere
trifle an old-established company lias to go into liquida-
tion, operations have to be suspended, utterly regardless
of the consequences, a great number of miners are turned
adrift in the inhospitable West at a moment's notice
during a time of great general depression, and when there
is no trace of horse-feed within a hundred miles for the
hundreds of horses which have been used in the Co.’s
service under the confident expectation of permanent
work.—Another One Disgusted.

A leviathan Australian speculator has submitted
to his creditors a balance-sheet showing liabilities total-
ling £2,800,000. On boom estimates, the assets are made
to overtop this large amount, and, as full interest has
been guaranteed on all of it, the plunger has been allowed
a few years’ grace to endeavour to pull through.
# * #
Among the other humours of the Real Estate
Bank it now transpires that it mortgaged £lOO,OOO worth
of its uncalled capital to the Home and Colonial Assets
and Debenture Corporation, therefore the prospects of
paying off the depositors even out of calls—if the calls
can he collected—is not so rosy as it looked. The Ileal
Estate Bank was evidently a far-seeing corporation which
prepared itself for the hereafter, for the memorandum
of association expressly permits this peculiar method of
financing, and Judge Hodges lias decided that the
transaction is perfectly lega'. It would be interest-
ing to know how much the Home and Colonial
Corporation advanced on the security, and what the
interest amounts to. And it would tie still more interest-
ing to know—seeing that only a certain number of shares
were thus mortgaged—whether they are the directors’
own shares, or whether they belong to outside holders?
As the mortgaged individuals will have to pay up to the
last gasp so that the lenders may get their money back,
and as the average director, according to the common
belief, never pays his calls in f ill if he can help it, t l,: s
latter point is of more than usual importance.

It is characteristic of Melbourne that after the

(Melb.), said that the bank’s capital was “ intact,” and

From the latest labour manifesto ; “ The

actual cash invested in the mine.”

The Broken Hill directors, in reply to the

Queensland mining regulations forbid the hold-

Last chapter of the Bonanza mine—sold by the

The Snide Finance Co. then pays this borrowed £30,000

Eastern. lie declares that several thousands have been

moters on fulfilling every financial and other obligation.
We ate glad to bear it, but he omits to tell us what we
specially wanted to know, viz., the amount paid, or con-
tracted to be paid, to the original owners so as to enable a
comparison lo be made with ihe amount of cash Ibo
promoters asked the pub ic to put up. The richest mine
in the world can be purchased at 100 great a price, and,
good as we trust the Great Eastern is, and rich as it may
yet prove to be, we are certain that when it was so floated
in England the mine was not worth one-fifth of the
amount asked for it.

Often the well-meaning S.M. Herald is inno-

Probably thegreatest hydraulic gold-sluicing field
in Australia will be along the banks of the Shoalhaven. The
Bulletin has said this once before; it says it again
because it wants to take credit for the prediction at the
proper time. There are there countless millions of tons
of gold-hearing w ash extending over upwards of 50 miles
—the old river-bed—which, with unlimited water and
abundance of get-away will pay enormous dividends, not
because of its richness, hut through economical working.
Where unlimited water can he got by gravitation thou-
sands of tons can be worked away weekly for as man v
pence; hence if the yield is six grains of gold per ton it
will indeed mean wealth. The field is at present com-
manding the attention of the Maorilanders and Victorians.
Adelaide men are also “going in,” and after all the best
blocks are secured N.S.W. will come with the usual rush.
Immense as the gold-bearing area is, a comparatively
small portion only can be worked advantageously - i.e.,
where water can’he got by gravitation and wash automa-
tically removed. Many places have one without the other,
and very few areas hjtve both. The Spa and Jessop pro-
perties are considered good enough for the use of tre-
mendous steam-pumps, the annual maintenance of which
will be about £4000; but where water can he gravitated
that amount of gold yearly would pay good dividends on
the outlay and working expenses.

Pambula gold-mine reports : “ Crushed about

less all-round value than this paid over £14,000 dividends
on Bendigo a week ago. The Pambula’s “ lode” is patchy
and not too well defined, but the frequent occurrence of
patches has just enabled a company which never had any
actual capital to pay its way. The worst feature about
the mine is that the lode is on the edge of its boundary.

money with Lord Rosebery during the election,
Gladstone fell sound asleep during dinner on two
occasions after the first course, and was removed
to his bedroom in his chair asleep and put to bed.
This tendency to drowsiness has been noticed
lately in the House of Commons, but it has
increased rapidly.
In the matter of the will of a deceased
Australian politician, for whose “legal ” heirs the
Curator of Intestate Estates has advertised, no
less than 85 persons have turned up as claimants.
Deceased has left a number of natural children to
whom he willed the residue of Ida estate, but he
died suddenly before signing the document.
Little Carey, whose conscience has com-
pelled him to give up the editorship of the Laun-
ceston (Tas.) Examiner, was once a printer in
Adelaide. He is a rigid teetotaller, and, when
resident in the Holy City, he used to refuse to
print beer-labels or wine-cards. These small pre-
judices do not suit the commercial instincts of a
modern daily paper.
The maiden name of the unfortunate
woman so well-known as “Lady Munro ” in all
the capitals of Australasia was Elizabeth Mon-
teith, and she is a cousin, not a sister, of L idy
Mordaunt and of the Dowager Countess of Dudley.
The present Captain Munro was not her first
husband, for she was originally married to his
brother, also a Captain Munro, who died in India.
She gets .£2OO a year paid quarterly from
“Home.”
Mr. Pater, the just-deceased eccentric
Adelaide P.M., openly described the public
in his Court as “ the great unwashed.” Once an
old and infirm man was summoned before him for
allowing a cow to stray on the park lands.
Defendant pleaded poverty, said that the cow was
his only means of subsistence, and, if forced to pay
for its keep, he would simply have to die. “It is
better that you die than that one by-law of the
city be broken,” replied Pater. Was it a joke?
No one could ever tell.
The elder Vanderbilt’s treasure - vault,
where he kept his cash and securities, was one of
the wonders of the world. The walls, of stone and
steel, were five feet thick. Inside these was
another vault built entirely of hardened steel, and
Vanderbilt’s securities were in the inner vault. The
doors were guarded day and night by armed men,
and the armed men were watched by detectives,
and old Vanderbilt died of brain-paralysis brought
on by wondering where he could find some reliable
individuals to watch the detectives.
Charles Summers’ bust of Sir John
O’Shanassy was recently sold by auction, in
Melbourne, under lamentable circumstances. The
work of art, which ought to have been bought for
the local National Gallery long ago, passed into
the possession of brother Doctor of Music Joe
Summers when the sculptor died. A forced sale
of the embarrassed Dr. Joe’sjfurniture occurred the
other day, and the highest bidder picked up this
famous marble image for the paltry consideration
of three pun’ten. Fact. The bust of O’Shanassy,
by Charles Summers, was knocked down at

The Pastorallst’s Review on W
Abbott:— ’
Mr. Abbott’s services to the pastoralists of Ansi-w
have been many and great, but with characterise
modesty be has persistently refused to admit that he i
done anything entitling him to thanks or reward
only a few months ago peremptorily stopped a movent,a
that was afoot among his admirers to present him win,
piece of plate in recognition of those services. Of a dot a
mined and courageous nature, he is a man well omlifi/i
to lead, whilst his well-balanced and logical mind eon,
hined with a gentle, almost lovable disposition imltL 1,;
revered of all who know him. ’ 11111
Abbott, “of a gentle and almost loveable dis
position”! Why, people who used to read his
squattoplnle letters to the press mostly took him
for a raging fiend with hoofs and a spiky tail.
R. Meredith, M.H.R. (Maoriland), is a
painfully slow orator, and ornaments his delivery
with great gasps of silence. The other day he
intended to tell the House this ;
I once knew a widow in Christchurch. She had several
children. In her husband’s absence she was the bread
winner of the family.
Here is a verbatim, report:—
I once knew a widow—(long pause ; voices, “Oh 1 ”)
in Christchurch -(a reminiscent pause)—she had several
children—(pause, with a chorus of “Oh ! ”)—in her hus-
band’s absence—(sensation, cries of “Shame!” mixed
with cackles of laughter)—in the absence of her husband
sir—(accentuation of horror, and “ Oh, oh ! ” from every
part of the House) —she was the breadwinner of the
family.
Then, with the solemnity of an owl in a trance
Meredith proceeded to apply the narrative to
arguments on the Property Tax.
Henry Elms Lette, 30 years member for
Launceston (Tas.), died last week. He was a son
of Peter Lette, an early-day colonist, and one of
the most remarkable men who ever settled in
Tasmania. Lette (the father) has the following
inscription on his tombstone; the striking
sentence of the conclusion was dictated by him-
self on his deathbed :
Peter Lette, mariner, of Curramore House, Shelburn
County of Wexford, Ireland. Born 1776, died Aprils'
1833. Rather than submit to the iron hand of despotism'
he became a self-exile, and has, though at great sacrifice’
lived and died free. Sons, follow the example of your
father ; be prudent, hut never crouch to the fell tyrant,
nor suffer insult with impunity.
Desiring to be cremated, he wished the inscription
to be placed upon the urn containing his ashes,
but his widow buried and would not burn him.
The explanation of the epitaph is to be found in
the fact that he was “ out in ’98.”
Henniker Heaton’s example is infectious,
remarks our London correspondent, and there has
been quite a crop of Australasian candidates for
Parliamentary honours at the present general
election. They have not fared quite so well as
J. H. H. Tom Curran, once of Cooma, but more
recently proprietor of the Oxford and Pfahlerfs
Hotels, Sydney, has succeeded in getting an Irish
seat, as has his son. In this he ties for the
record with Gladstone and Joe Chamberlain.
Young Dalton has, however, received his conge
from the electors of Meath (South), Howard
Spensley wooed Dudley in vain ; and amongst the
defeated are Faithfull Begg, formerly an officer of
the Union Bank, Arthur Clayden, who hails from
Maoriland, or has business relations there, and
Harold Finch-Hatton, a Queenslander by adoption
—at all events he appears at the annual dinner
with great regularity. Salmon Wilson discreetly
declined to risk defeat at Portsmouth, but Ids
colleague. Sir William Crossman—a some time
West Australian —was knocked out this time.
Two other quasi-Australians who are well-known
as business men in connection with “ ths
colonies,” Messrs. Cameron Corbett and Brodie
Hoare, have also been rejected. Mr. Graham, of
South Australia, lias been more successful and has
wrested a Liberal seat for the Tories from young
Lawson in St. Pancras. Unless we can call Sir
John Gorst a Maorilandtr, Mr. Graham is the
only one besides Heaton, the Currans, and Mr.
Graham who have gained seats. I must no)
forget Pritchard Morgan, who no doubt wih be re-
elected for Merthyr Tydvil.

Sir Bryan O’Loghlen sanguinely believes
that Victoria can still borrow £3,000,000 a year
for seven years. “ Share, let us live on postherity,”

Which are the furthest-advanced demo-

deniably South Australia and Maoriland. And
why ? Because they have one-man-one-vote and the
other provinces haven’t.
The S.A. Legislative Councillors never
c ase to lament their giving way over the Free
Education Bill, and the “National Defence”
League contemplates an agitation to restore the old
system of fees. Too late !
The S.A. Government are now stipulating
that all State contracts be carried out, as far as
possible, by means by local labour and local
material. The Crow-eaters, as usual, lead the
way in interprovincial progress.
“The zone system,” remarks a correspon-
dent, “otherwise the reduction of railway charges
to little more than nothing, now in favour in

Temperance-oratress Mrs. Bowes says that
the N.S.W. depression and distress are not to be

Lawyer Dobson, the Tasmanian Premier, is
evidently not a lover of the island’s shekels, as_ he
holds no salaried office in his Administration.
Tasmania has had many Premiers who have held
no salaried office, but they did not belong to the
Devil’s Own.
South Australia has a contingent liability
for pastoral improvements of £2,350,000, cal-
culated at £lB per square mile, which is stated by
experts to be £lO too low. Already £673,354 has-
been paid to the squatters. Some advanced

Labour-leader Spence ran Thompson, des-
cribed as the “Liberal-Conservative” (any-

The voting was 763 and 725.
It is twenty-one years now since Graham

The strange thing was Munro taking the
Agent-Generalship when he knew the storm must

The second reading of Sir George Grey s
Bill to provide for the election of Governors by
the people was lost in the Maoriland Lower House
by one vote. Think of it! The imported nominee
Governor is the last visible “silken bond” that

eternal smash by a majority of one !
Several members of Parliament who sup-
port the Dibbs Government contributed towards
the recent election expenses of Tonkin (who beat

ness of “ several members of Parliament who
support the Dibbs Government.”

The S. A. Labour-party will probably, owing

Playford, Grayson, Stock, Jenkins, Hawker, L.

John Bergan, the Sydney woollen-manu
facturer, is running a tilt with the Womanhood
Suffrage League. Not many months ago he
startled the white-waistcoated members of the
Employers’ Union with a proposal to adopt ten

for the time; and now he utters a long shriek
against the leaders of Parkes’ Forlorn Hope, and
appeals to the plural voters to lend no counten-
ance to the agitation for womanhood suffrage
because it will secure “the speedy and unqualified
triumph of the local Labour-natty.”
Griffith’s Conciliation

All the s e agitations

Dalziel’s Agency re-
presented ex - Speaker
Groom (Q.) as having
described the Kanaka
Act as most distasteful
to the people of Queens-
land, and having re-
marked that the indecent
lhaste with which the
matter was pushed
through the Legislature
was a public scandal.
Groom is now under-
stood to characterise the
opinions attributed to
y him as gross exaggera-
tions, and to say that he
a formal inter-
view with Dalziel’s re-
t porter. The Bulletin surmises that Groom
is poke after the dinner given him by Henniker

Kingston, Q.C., is expected to move in
;S.A. Assembly that the principle of elective
Ministers shall come into force with next Parlia-
ment in March. The Government profess them-
selves in favour of the principle, but they wished
to refer it to a select committee, and some mem-
bers «f tlte House thought that was an excuse for
shelving the whole subject. So the motion was
■defeated, as previously stated, by a majority of
ithree votes.
Several members of the Labour-party in
AT.S. \V. Parliament arw suspected of manoeuviiug
It or snug billets in the Civil Service on the termi-

come a Civil servant in a “ jiffey,” but in other
provinces a supporter cannot be palm-oiled by the
Govt, until he has ceased to sit in the Senate
House for six months.
“ The financial debate lias descended to a

Mr. Reeves, in a condition bordering on apoplexy,
Jour minutes further on.
Chief Justice Lilley’s judgment against
"the Queensland Investment Co. s local directors
raises the question of the violability of Crown
grants. It is contended for the defendants that,
though Grimley may have illegally acquired lands,
the directors of the Investment Co. were justified
in advancing loans, inasmuch as the Crown never
repudiates its own grants, and that his Honor
should not have traced the acquisition of the
selections any further back than the issue of
Crown grants.
S.M. Herald : If Secretary for the
Colonies Ripon instructs Gov. Glasgow (Maori-
land) to yield to the advice of his Ministers re
the appointment of more Legislative councillors,
“ then farewell to hopes that the system of nomi-
nated second Chambers will be worked on safe
and satisfactory lines.” So! The S.M. Hehald
evidently still thinks that a goitre on the neck of
democracy is essential to the health of the body
politic. All live men have long ago given up hope
as regards nominee legislative museums.
A N.Q. beche-de-rner fisherman recently
took with him as his cruising assistant a nine-year-
old girl-picaninny. Another went away with two
black boys, and returned alone —no questions
asked. A third marooned a boy and two girls
without rations on an island, pursued them after
they escaped to the mainland, collared their
clothes, which had been given them in lieu of
wages, and gashed the boy with a tomahawk. All
these things happened, without unpleasant conse-
quences to the perpetrators of them, in that Aus-
tralian province the Government of which has
guaranteed to prevent abuses in a kidnapping
trade two thousand miles beyond its jurisdiction.
It is the fixed impression in London that
Agent-General Munro is gone for good, and that
Shiels will be his successor. The Premier’s
venerable mother is said to be the chief obstacle
in the way of his quitting Australia, but probably
he, the nearest approach to a democratic Victorian
statesman, will go in the end, and become Sir Bill
Shiels, and learn to reverence the British
aristocracy, and become a solemn, reverent Tory
like the rest. And then, later on, Sir Bill will
come back to Australia to boom the “silken
bonds,” and Imperial Federation, and the other
stereotyped idols of the rotters who infest the
land.
When Government wants any land for
public purposes, the proprietor has been so ac-
customed to get from the Treasury about six times
as much as he can obtain from anyone else, that
the arbitration system recently introduced in
N.S.W. is a disagreeable surprise. Lately, the
HARDLY EVAH.
HE: “Well, howevah, you must weally admit there is nothing
bettah than an English gentleman."
SHE: (only a “ colonial ”): “I am very unfortunate, but I have

Railway Department wished to purchase an allot-
ment from Wollongong Gas Co., and as the sellers'
terms were exorbitant, the matter went to arbi-
tration. Result: the Gas Co. gets .£350 for the
land, and has to pay £O2B costs of arbitration.
It is a blessed thing for the nation to get square
with at least one Gas Co., but the kind of arbitra-
tion which costs £O2B to decide the value of £350
worth of land is a legal infamy.
The Sydney D.T. is chagrined that the
Marquis of Ripon has been appointed Gladstone’s
Secretary of State for the Colonies, and pines for
ex-Governor Carington !
11l Maoriland, since the Ballanco Govern-
ment piled a heavy tax on foreign capital and
absentee proprietors, tlie investments of foreign
money in the country have increased by over
43300,000— yet the Tory press howls about the
withdrawal of capital as loudly as ever. This lie
ought to be played out by now. Capital can t
get out of a country. Capital consists of about
one per cent, money and 90 per cent, lands,
houses, mines, docks, fences, tanks, and similar
irremoveables. Therefore, the capitalist can’t get
away without selling these things, and if he sells
them the capital of the man who buys them fills
the gap. If he wants to realise in a hurry he may
depreciate things so much as to destroy capital,
but he can’t shift it—unless he packs the whole
country up in a bag and takes it away “home”
with him.
Speaking at Parkes, N.S.W., G. H. Reid
said that the placing of duties on wheat would
attract large numbers to the farming industry
with the result that competition would render it
loss profitable than at present. He illogically
ignores the fact that farming will only be carried
by competition to as low a point of remuneration
as (all circumstances considered) holds in other
occupations. Consequently, only half his state-
ment is true, and, unfortunately for him, that half
makes directly against his main contention. The
imposition of a duty on wheat will enable a
greater number to prosecute farming without any
diminution in the present average return. It will
enable a greater number to obtain at least the
present return while increasing the profits of those
already engaged in it. Competition will only tend
to lower the return in farming when the return in
all other occupations is being lowered by the same
agency.
As foreshadowed in The Bulletin long
ago, there is a difficulty in the matter of the appeal
in the big Queensland land-mortgage cases, on the
first of which Chief Justice Lilley the other day
delivered judgment. By Section 4of the Q.
Supreme Court Act no Judge can assist to hear an
appeal from himself. Of the two other Judges
resident in Brisbane one is a marriage connection
of one of the defendants, and the other was, before
his elevation to the Bench, briefed as counsel for
one of the parties to the suit. Both these Judges
desire to be excused from sitting. Which leaves
available only the Northern Judges—Cooper and
Chubb —who will have to leave their own realms
of jurisdiction in order to hear the appeal; while,
as the law further requires the presence of three
judges, a third man will have to be appointed.
This necessary act of a Griffith-MTlwraith
Government is certain to be closely scrutinised,
since MTlwraith is one of the appellants.
“Phil. May’s Summer Annual,” just to
hand from the London publishers, Haddon and
Co., is one of the best shillingsworths of its kind
ever given to the public. The chief interest is, of
course, attached to the pictures, but the literary
matter is also far above the average, and the con-
tributors have squeezed their 17 sketches and
stories into some-80 pages of letterpress. Among the
veteran writers fo: - the “ Annual” are Sala, Payn.
Christie Murray, Sims, and Clement Scott, while
the ‘‘new humour” is represented by Zangwill
and Barry Pain. Murray has drawn upon his
Australian experiences for his subject, and “ The
Eight O’Clock Rush,” a sketch of a broken-down
Melbourne man, who manages to preserve ai
outward appearance of comparative respectability
but takes his share of the charity meal at the
restaurant in the evening, is one of the cleverest
things in the book. As to the pictures, which
occupy nearly 50 pages, readers of The Bulletin
need no recommendation to Phil May. The artist
appears to have i-evelled in his work, and the
same skill in characterisation, the same certainty
of line, and the same power of producing exactly
the effect required with apparently little effort—
qualities that have placed him at the head of
English modern pen-draughtsmen—are to be
found here. The book will have a big sale in
Australia.
Liver complaint is the cause of many
pains and aches which some people consider
are separate and distinct complaints. Head-
aches, palpitation, indigestion, flatulence, &c.,
are symptoms of a disordered liver and stomach.
Many are the quack nostrums sold as cures
for “ indigestion but surely the world is
getting sufficiently enlightened to see through
the quackery which is so prevalent in this country.
There are broken-down plumbers, painters,
plasterers, and printers selling “medicines” to
cure diseases of which these people do not even
know the symptoms, to say nothing of the
therapeutics. Such is not the case with L)r.
Fletcher’s Pills. These are the prescription of
one of England’s most eminent physicians and
pathologists, and have been used most successfully
by him for the last thirty years in private and
hospital practice. They have ever been found
effectual in all bilious, stomach and liver com-
plaints, and can be used by both sexes with the
utmost confidence. They are sold by all medicine
vendors, and E. M. Clements, Newtown. Sydney,
post free, thirteen penny stamps. Mr. H.
Dowling, Chemist, Brisbane, writes referring to
these Pills “ Since taking Dr. Fletcher’s Pills
my health has wonderfully improved. I have dis-
carded all others, and I consider these worth =£loo
a box.— Henky Dowling.”
Impossible, dear lord ; the peer
May sit, to all intents,
But Australia can never be
The thing he represents.

We would rather have none,

THE BALLAD OF G. R. DIBBS.
Tliis is the story of G. R. D.,
Who went on a mission across the sea
To borrow some money for you and me.
This G. R. Dibbs was a stalwart man
Who was built on a most extensive plan,
And a regular staunch Republican.
But he fell in the hands of the Tory crew
Who said, “ It’s a shame that a man like you
Should teach Australia this nasty view.
From her mother’s side she should ne’er be gone,
And she ought to be glad to be smiled upon,
And proud to be known as our hanger-on.”
And G. R. Dibbs, he went off his peg
At the swells who came for his smiles to beg
And the Prince of Wales—who was palling his leg
And he told them all when the wine had flown,
“ The Australian has got no land of his own,
His home is England, and there alone.”
So he strutted along with the titled band
And he sold the pride of his native land
For a bow and a smile and a shake of the hand,
And the Tory drummers they sit and call :
“ Send over your leaders great and small ;
For the price is low, and we’ll buy them all
With a tinsel title, a tawdry star
Of a lower grade than our titles are,
And a puff at a Prince’s big cigar.”
And the Tories laugh till they crack their ribs
When they think how they purchased G. It. Dibbs.

During the hearing of the Glebe riot case?*
yesterday afternoon in the Central Police
Court a witness, unintentionally, perhaps,
made an excellent suggestion for the treat-
ment of larrikins with a view of convincing
them of the quality of mercy they dispense
so lavishly to their victims. In the rough*
and-tnmble that the two police constables
had with the 11 push ” oneof the constables
(Jackson) hit one of his opponents in the i
mouth and. to .use the opponent’s own words,
“ knocked Vjim dazzled against the walk’’
Jackson, however, said that the accused
cried out, “ Strike, boys, strike, give them
the metal,” in answer to which a shower of
stones came flying into the hotel. Not de-
siring a close acquaintance with the chunks
of macadam, Jackson, who was the stronger
man of the two, held his prisoner up between
himself and the firing push, with the result
that the prisoner’s head suffered severely
* And you actually held him up before yon
as a shield ?” asked the prisoner’s solicitor in
a horror-stricken tone of voice. “ Certainly
I did, replied the constable smilingly. ** You 1
ofoe he cried out to his motes to ‘ give them
metal, and I hdld him up so that he could
get what be was calling for. It wasn’t lorg
before he cried out to stop throwing.” added
the witness segely.

The only question really to be considered
In connection with the Barton-Purves struggle for
the possession of the little infant <£70,000 heiress,
Kathleen Panes M'Pherson, was whether (the
infant’s father having pre-deceased its mother),
the court should be guided in its decision as to the
infant’s guardianship by the dying wishes of
the mother. The judge having decided this in
the affirmative, has awarded the guardianship to
Mr. Barton, the stepfather, to whom the deceased
lady willed the charge of the child. The mother’s
relatives now appeal to the Full Court.
# # #
A barrister, representing Purves in the
golden kid case, used the word “ kidnapping,” not
in reference to his client’s capture of Kathleen
Macpherson, but in reference to the step-father’s
alleged intention to catch hold of the child if he
could find her roaming abroad after Purves had
started the game of grab. The force of legal im-
pudence, of which a wig is the sacred symbol,
can’t go much further than this.
George E. Gibbes, the Anglican parson
who has left Mount Pleasant, S.A., to take charge
of St. Andrew’s, Sydney, was once a Wesleyan
local preacher. He is “good, but garrulous.” One
of his reverend predecessors at Mount Pleasant
astonished the locals by climbing on to a bullock-
dray in a state of nudity and preaching a perfervid
sermon to a flock of geese.

“ He ” was a swell leaning on his stick at
the main Sydney tram waiting-place apart from
profanum ruUjus. “The Other ” had seen better
days, but now saw chiefly through tumblers, self-
respect being unconscious Jf not drowned. As
“ The Other ” lurched past w He,” quick to disceVn
and act, unostentatiously slipped half-a-crown into
the former’s palm, which “The Other” accepted
equally privately so as not to give “He” away,
and without even a nod or a pause lurched on.
“ He ” caught the writer’s eye and blushed scarlet.
Which proves that white men wear all sorts of
'coats and sometimes no coats at all.
* * *
Male senility versus prime womanhood
was the nature of a Sydney divorce-case the other
day. Old Seventy-seven accused Mrs. Thirty-seven
of unlawfully loving someone nearer her own age ;
and Mrs. Thirty-seven retorted that old Seventy-
seven was a cruel monster within the meaning of
the Act. Old Senility’s evidence was “muzzy,”
and he sought to account for it by stating that,
ever since his wife had “rubbed something on his
nose,” his memory had failed him. The judge
stood by prime womanhood, and cast the patriarch
in costs. As he appears to be unable to fork out,
the probability is that he will have to “ purge his
contempt ” in the usual cheerful way.
* * •
According to common report, there is not
now sitting-room in the N.S.W. Colonial Secre-
tary’s office for all the officials, and at least two
have always to be out taking a walk in order to
relieve the pressure on the Government space.
And a wild, weird story is told of a boss
official who came back unexpectedly one day, and
found a clerk having his hair cut in the room over
which he, the boss, presided. Whereupon the latter
asked, in an awful voice, what might be the mean-
ing of this proceeding, and then he abruptly told
the barber to take his tools and begone, and
the barber bewent in confusion, leaving his client
with a pair of imperfectly-balanced whiskers and
with one side of his hair cut short and the other
side cut long.
* * #
Three “ bank ” boomers were incarcerated
in a Sydney cell, awaiting bail. A half-drunken
man, about to “do” a seven days’ stretch, was
also accommodated. H e was apparently astonished
at the respectable appearance of the trio, and
appealing to one of them said ; “ ’Axing your
pardon, and what is your trouble?” “Well,”
replied John, “I’m the captain, this is my mate,
and this my steward. We’re in for shooting a
Kanaka.” “Well, I’m damned! What’s the
country coming to ? There ain’t no crime muoli,
surely, in potting an adjective nigger ! ”

The biggest toady Sydney has ever known
(everybody will recognise him at once from this
description— he is now abroad with a strange
woman) was seen at Lord’s at the Eton and

Caldwell, M.P. (S. A.), thinks “a father of
a family shou'd be granted a vote for every mem-
ber of his household.” Good idea :It may induce

A very much-divorced medical man has, it

Sydney.

On Thursday last week some “ practical
joker ” wasted sixpence on an evening paper
advertisement setting forth that an elderly char-
woman could find constant employment at The
Bulletin office. This brilliantly witty capitalist
will, no doubt, be much gratified to know that ever
since old women, in search of work, have been
trudging BuLLKTiN-wards through the rain.

A Tasmanian country girl, the other day,
was told by a friend in Hobart that a certain
middle-aged gentleman was looking for a wife. She
took the train at once for the city, met the lonely
bachelor, and in less than two hours from her

The Dobson element is now all-powerful in
Tasmania. Brother Henry is Premier ; Brother
William Lambert is Chief Justice; and Brother
Alfred is Solicitor-General, with a prospect of
taking a seat on the Bench beside Brother William.
Henry Dobson has won his spurs very quickly : he
has not been in public life for many months. Per-
haps it is another case of lovely woman winning
over votes for her husband. With Mrs. Dobson
pulling the strings from behind the Speaker’s
chair, and Mrs. Douglas doing similar service in
the Council, the Dobson-Douglas Cabinet should
be a long-lived one.

We were talking to a member of a jury
which, the other day, acquitted an influential per-
sonage against whom the evidence was clear as
daylight. “You see it was this way. Nine of
the jury didn’t care a rap whether ho got con-
victed or not; I was determined to got him off,
and the other two were keen on lagging him.
They swore they’d never give in; so did I. In
the end I wore ’em down. The other nine really
didn’t mind which way it went.”

People are saying that the Sydney
Y.M.C. A. officials show scant courtesy to the
academical nabobs they invite to lecture to them.
It is hardly the correct caper to leave a lecturer to
find his own way on to the platform, introduce
himself to his audience, and, at the close, amble
off without even the dreary compliment of a vote
of thanks. They are also hinting that it is not
necessary to cultivate piety to the exclusion of the
other amenities of social life.

Three out of every four divorces in

The Committee of Kyabram (Vic.) Me-
chanics’ Institute has just framed some new rules.
One of these excludes dogs from the reading-room,
and another prohibits clergymen from acting on
the committee. The last was strongly supported
by prominent Presbyterians, Wesleyans, Catholics,
and Anglicans, and for curious and various
reasons. “ I don’t care if 1 have to run foul of an
ordinary man occasionally, but I draw the line at
the clergy.” “ Parsons are not a success on neigh-
bouring committees ; they can never agree.”
“ When a parson is present, it is impossible for
anyone to express himself as freely or emphati-
cally as he would like to do.” And so on..
Evidently, the “ third sex ” has made Kyabram
tired.

Some advt. lithographs have been stopped
at the Melbourne Customs on the ground that
the subjects are doubtful. “Doubtful” means

Melbourne Age, which once called The
Bulletin a dust-heap, or something of that sort,
has tried its heavy hand at “wholesome fun."
Concerning a certain seizure of pills the influential
organ observes that “these pills, although guar-
anteed to remove all obstructions, cannot, it
seems, get past the Customs.” The Bulletin
would scorn to describe the Age as a literary
sewer which discharges its filth upon the Mel-
bourne breakfast-table and infects the hain-and-

can be exquisitely beastly for a penny.

THE KNIGHT OF NOW.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The knight of old A knight to-day
Was twice as hold Ain’t built that way.
As lions in their den, He’s mostly tame and fat ;
For fame he’d fight You know him by
Prom morn till night— His shifty eye
He knew no bet ter then ; And silk hell-topper hat;
He threw down gloves The taint of shame
For lady loves, Pol'utes his name.
His suits were made of tin ; A fairly decent Chow
Come peace or war, S ems sweet and clean
Red human gore (God save the Queen !)
That hero waded in. Beside some knights of now.
The knight of old. The knight to day
Though gone to mould, May lead the fray
Still lives in modern song ; When luncheons free are
And “ mashes ” slim spread,
Hold forth on him To none he yields
In ballads hot and strong ; On banquet fields
His gallant deeds Until he’s cold and dead ;
The schoolboy reads, Hut when he goes
And whilst the breezes To long repose
blow, So laurels deck his brow ;
We’ll proudly skite Despised, f wgot,
About the knight. He’s left to rot—
The knight of long ago. The bloated knight of now.
Melbourne.

I WONDER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ah !■ when our youth has waned
With the fruit of the yielding years,
And the paths of our lives are stained
With manifold laughter and tears ;
When the dreams that we dream are spent,
And the promise of life fulfilled,
When the joys that are sweet are lent
To the tale that the years distilled ;
When the shadows of Night are creeping
O’er the earth-born life that fades
And faints ’neath the burden of weeping,
Then rests in the changeless shades.
Is there aught in our hearts will never
Decay with the wasting frame ;
Will Love, sweet! last for ever,
Be stronger than Death or Fame ?
Will Love, breaking forth like flowers
That blossom ’neath winter’s spell,
Grow strong with increasing hours
Till the time when the mystic bell
Shall beckon us hence to the meadows
Where Sunlight and Love are supreme,
And, freed from the taint of Life’s shadows,
We grasp the glad joy that we dream ?

It seems that since a Yank divorce
Can be obtained with ease,
The law is mostly put in force
By discontented shes.
Which does not prove the dames despise
The good old marriage plan,
But rather that they’ve fixed their eyes
Upon another man.
For love indeed is often blind
Because it doesn’t suit
A level-headed wife to find
Her husband is a “ brute,”
But when to make a second match
Her heart begins to long,
She lays a little trap to catch
The villain going wrong.
A “creature " with “a brazen face ”
Is branded as the Co.,
And virtue actuates the ease
Of Mrs. So-and-So.
Of course she can’t forgive the crime,
No honest woman can -
But, as it happens, half the time
She wants that other man.

The principal feature about the average

catalogue the property, it proved that everything
down to the soap in the kitchen had been “lent

tiling liable to seizure was a very ancient hog in a
paddock. And when the trustee went out to look
at tins solitary asset lie found that it was

A Melbourne lady stated in court the
other day that her husband received, 10 years ago,
a legacy of .£40,000, and had since then spent
>£20,000 in drink alone. That makes nearly
twenty-five million long beers —two-and-a-half
million beers per annum. What a thirst!

Melbourne Leader comes out with an
alleged portrait of “Charles Melbourne Hope,”
the latest offspring of Governor Hopetoun. It
exhibits him as a short, bald, red-faeed, large-
eared infant, of a somnolent aspect and apparently
given to drink. Also, he lacks the somewhat
sloppy aspect which is characteristic of the com-
mon or garden infant, but probably that is owing
to an effort of imagination on the part of the
artist.

A Disease? Or Sin? Or a Little of Both?

'Vb.N r to hear the Yankee Major, Alfred H.
Lalfioun, lecture in Sydney_Y.M.G.A. Hall, on
IJth on the Keely Cure for Drunkenness
“w»e , DouWe-Chlor.de of Gold,” if you please,

„ ■though why hi shouldn t mean
double, as well as two’ or twice, I leave
to the philologists.
Calhoun is a prominent-featured, heavy-browed
man, with eyes that glitter excitedly under gus-
light. Those who know the “Sacred Ibis ” of
North Queensland will get a fair notion of Cal-
houn’s general expression if I say that his face
calls Chicago “Shickawgo,” and often rushes
out his last words too fast for oral assimilation.
lie will frequently pause right after a rela-
tive or demonstrative pronoun while one could
slowly count up to 20, and then make a cavalry
charge at a string of Yankeeisms that are com-
pletely lost to the audience in a blend of simul-
taneous syllables.
Major Calhoun defines drunkenness after a
certain habitual line has been passed—as a disease
and not a sin. He says that a man alcoholically
diseased can at times no more exercise will-power
a g a ; ns t drinking alcohol than an ordinary man
a tr a inst breathing
Calhoun really knows all about dipsomaniacs. I
give him a diploma on that score. He told his
a udience about three typical ones whom he per-
sonally knew—a lawyer, a doctor, and a parson.
They were all perfect and ideal men, but for the
one drawback. Brilliant of intellect, without an
impure thought (Calhoun is a mind reader), with
no suggestion of vice, thorough gentlemen of high
honour and good principle, men, too, of firm will —
NOT A MODERATE DRINKER.
BROWN : “I saw Smithy the other day, and he looked pretty
bad.”
JONES: “Always does look bad. Drinks too much.”
BROWN: “You surprise me. I understood that he was not
drinking any more.”
JONES: “I should hope not! If he did he’d drown himself.”
but absolutely helpless whenever “ the fatal
craving ”of “ the disease ” came on. The lawyer
turned temperance-lecturer, and at every periodi-
cal alcoholic visitation used to lock himself up
and soak in whisky. Then he would return
to adorn the temperance platform ! The
doctor used to rush up a big practice for
three months or so, and was adored by his patients
for his skill and mesmeric powers; suddenly he
would disappear to unknown distances and turn
up in hospital or gaol—mostly gaol. The parson
used to get the craving sometimes, even when on
his knees in the pulpit, and used to “sherry”
home and drink himself to saturation, suffer a
recovery, and go back to his missionary work. He
was always forgiven by his congregation. Dipso-
maniacs (Calhoun appears to think) are all pure
angels with only one bad point—a disease, sir, and
not a sin. Yea, Calhoun doth wisely know the
dipsomaniac.
By the way, some scientists argue that all sin is
a physical disease : Calhoun doesn’t. He says you
can’t cure lying with a tonic, or thieving with an
injection.
But I want to press home to its socket one o'
Calhoun’s arguments. He holds that a tendency
to become a drunkard is not hereditary, but that
the children of drunken forbears become, as it
were, alcohol-proof in the course of the descent of
generations. Just as the original colonists of
malarial country die like rotten sheep ; their sons
stand malaria better ; their grandsons better still;
and so on, until, in about the fifth generation, the
natives are malaria-proof, while strangers visiting
the district at once take the “ fever and shakes.
Then there is the opposite grog-experience of the
aborigines. Their forbears knew no alcoholic joys,
and they succumb to alcoholism very speedily.
Now, if this be so, what is the clear duty o*
those of the rising generation who seek to kil
King Alcohol sheer out of the world ? It is
obvious. They should drink and diink and
drink ; and their sons and daughters should swim
in liquor; also their sons and daughters after
them ; so that, in the fifth generation, their de-
scendants shall be whisky-proof! Old King
Alcohol would then die of a blighted heart. Let
ns sacrifice ourselves on the altar of Old Scotty !
(advt.)
O. D. Clark, M.P., was present at the lecture,
but he evidently chiefly wanted to hear his own
tongue wag on prohibition, under the disguise of
asking questions. Kvery question was a yard-
long, weary speech. Calhoun has challenged him
to a public debate on “ Prohibition,” offering to
pay two-thirds of the expenses of renting the
largest hall in Sydney. I can’t say if the contest
will come off or not. Calhoun’s contention is that
“Prohibition” does not prohibit. I, too,
that it doesn’t. You can no more “prohibit”
wine than you can women.
Calhoun declares that no analyst has ever ana-
lysed Dr. Keely’s hypodermic injection, though
many American doctors know the composition of
his internal tonic, as that is freely sent outside
the Keely Homes.
“If any analyst can find any infinitesimal
fraction of atropine in the injection,” says Cal-
houn, “Dr. Keely will pay 100,000 dollars to a
hospital, and I will admit that inebriety is a sin.
When I next feel “ the craving ” I am game to
test the Keely Cure, if Calhoun imports (as
threatened) a qualified “Keely doctor,” and the
latter will undertake to cure me for nothing. On
Calhoun’s own showing it would be a glorious deed
to do, for the doctor would be curing a mono-
streaked angel in
THE DIPSOMANIAC.
“The greatest minds of the human race
have generally been more or less revolutionary ; it
is the second-rate minds, weighted with education
that they have not assimilated, who look back-
ward instead of forward.” —Scrap of newspaper

The vanished and
mysterious Mrs. Clara
Parker, late of Mel-
bourne, accused of for-
gery by her pal, million-
aire “Joe” Clarke
(neither of her bail-
sureties appears to be
worth a rap), is, sister-
in-law to a Toorak
leaderess of “sassiety,”
who married a very
young husband indeed,
and who has been con-
nected with one or two
other locally prominent
incidents.
The Wesleyan
Church in Maoriland is
hard at work repealing
that old regulation where-
by the Wesleyan preacher
is moved on regularly
every three years and in-
flicted on a fresh congre-
gation. The preachers
all want this rule can-
celled, but the congrega-
tions are almost unani-
mously opposed to it. If
it is repealed there will
be a great and horrid
smash in the Wesleyan
sect, for it is the itineracy
law which has made its
prosperity. We never
knew a church yet which
wasn’t more or less tired
of the awful monotony of
its hired expounder, but
wh at keeps th e Wesleyans
up is the knowledge that
the good but dispiriting
man will be got rid of
in three years at the
furthest. And the way
to make Wesleyanism a
bigger success still is to
shift the preacher every
month, and never let him
come back. A church
which has always the
gladdening prospect that
it will never see its
minister again after the
end of the month is just
the sort of church that
che world is craving after.
The one fixed rule that
applies to every sect is
that the parson or the
congregation must go
away for a long rest
sooner or later, and it is
cheaper for the parson to
go, for the congregation
means the plate, and
when the plate has fled —
what remains?
D. N. Argus counsels the Rockhampton
and Central Queensland people to take their
affairs into their own hands anyhow, even if they
can’t get the control of them by fair and con-
stitutional means. The D.N. Argus was one
of the “ push ” of interested papers that
applauded good old Towzer’s gatling - gun
and shoot-era-down demonstration against the
Unionist shearers last year. Having once sooled
on the dogs of war in the cause of “ law and
order ” and “constitutionalism,” it should be
the first to be prepared to swallow its own
medicine. But there is Property loot in the
Separation cry.
Extract from the police evidence in the
case of Henry Sheehy, sentenced the other day in
Sydney to penal servitude for life for wife-
slaughter :
Sergeant Blackburn said to Sheehy : “ I heard you were
making through Double Bay; I thought you meant
suicide.” The reply was: “I did think of that, and
intended walking over the cliffs at the Gap, but, having
got two long-beers and a flask of brandy at Double Bay, I
changed my mind.”
Behold Grog, the Comforter ! The most wretched
life seems worth the living while the seductive
liquor holds its mirage before the muddled vision.
The most awful challenge of doom is but a school-
boy’s escapade so long as the alcoholic lens dazzles
the brain-screen. Thus, poverty and misery and
domestic woe beget drink far oftener than
drink breeds the evils promiscuously thrown
upon its shoulders. “A pernicious doctrine!”
cries the intemperate temperance reformer. But
absolutely true, and strangely rock-founded in the
quicksands of human weakness. Treat your poor
shivering deadbeat to threepen’orth of rum, ana
you give him threepen’orth of mock-happiness—
half-an-hour’s forgetfulness. Let the temperance
reformer help to change the conditions of the com-
petitive, weak-strangling, soul killing social
system that breeds the manifold miseries which
cause alcohol to be welcomed as a reliever, and the
publican will pine in the land as a result that must
fu'low its natural cause.
Answers to Correspondents.
No notice will be taken of communications which arrive
at. this office insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must in every case appear on MS.
“John B.” (Lismorc): Regret it is altogether
unpublishable “Yermyn”: The fact that a hushman
named Jim was jilted is too slender a foundation for a
story.... “ C.M.H.’' : The refrain, “My chum, my chum,’'
spoils a poem that wasn’t much good anyhow. “My
chump, my chump” would express the situation better.
.... “ H.J.F.” (Sydney): “ Ode to Woman ”is apparently
a feeble attempt at cynicism, as evidenced by the old joke
about the lady heaving the flat-iron.... “R. J. B.” (Neutral
Bay'): An “allegorical poem” of 30 verses—9 lines each—
is always declined. Surely you must think you are
shovelling ballast into a ship when you send a thing of
that size “R.W.” (Bendigo); Thanks.... “Rivulet ” :
The Australian never calls his mate “comrade” —in fact,
nobody does-neither does he he on a pallet - we don’t
believe there is such a thing. Also he doesn’t say “ per-
chance.” .. “One of Them”: One bush township is so
like another that there is no freshness in any of them
“ Eulo ” : What do you.mean by this?—
“hold up yor holy banners high and never be demaged
and all march to the buttel feild with hn yor lurn lied.”
... “J. Krow ” : Slab of decomposed Henry George. .
“Bernard”: Thanks. Will use. . “One of theV.A.”:
If the man was £lO short in his cash why shouldn’t he be
made to pay' up? Where’s the grievance... “Tom Gayndah”
(Cooktown): Yarn w'as officially declined many weeks ago..
“Gossan”; Gentle and washy teetotal story, with the
usual drunken father and dead child in it. Why is there
a dead child in every orthodox teetotal tale? “ Bendi-
gonian ” : it must have been first discovered by a corpse,
which rushed away and told a prison w ho wasn't born
“The Sphinx”; Joke evidently picked ere ripe.. . “_C.
Brooks ”: Only a commonplace suicide, adorned with
laughing-jackasses and burnt limbi r and the solemn
shadows of the everlasting hillsTenakoi ” : A very
depressing variety of humour “ F. Bernard”: “The
Colonial Young Man” is declined; such rhymes as
“ turnip” and “drunk,” “country ” and “grumpy” are
harrowing “W.A.H.” (Sydney); You know no law.
Why don't you say that your hero was banged for 20 years
with hard labour, for aggravated shortage in Ids accounts
w ith violence ?....“ Bandady ” : Nothing in it except an
odour of decomposed morals..., “ A New Chum’s Luck”:
In short, you “got up, washed, went to bed.” That’s
your tale in a nutshell....“ Miner ” (Charters Towers):
Thanks... “ S.D.”: Have read your story, “Mad or
Sane.” Think you are sane, but wouldn’t swear to it.
The story' is mad, though. ..." Act icon ” : We only print
zephyr poetry' in very small quantities. Many a paper
has been ruined by zephyr hards ... “ The Pauper ” ; An
unsympathetic way to tell the tale of “one more un-
fortunate ”: —
.... “V. Chambers ” : Consieh ring the heaviness of your
style, we are not surprised that your girl eloped with the
butcher “ Keith C.”: Life is short, and bosh is long,
and your “poem” is calculated to hang over into the
hereafter...." Warrane ” : Thanks. Will print.... “E.
Trevor” : Neatly written and full of noble sentiment, but
the trail of the commonplace is over them all "Leila
Madge” : Your poem, “Wanted a Husband,” is too
obviously a heart-broken cry addressed to actor Ryley’s
beautiful legs... “The Ron-Political Dodge”; Your
political theories are upside-down. It is not the capitalis-
tic, but the democratic, party which wants to restrict the
centralisation of power in the hands of the Legislature.
Parliament is still the best log-rolling machine going, and
for getting roads made through a Minister’s private pro-
perty it has no equal ...“Rostra”: The bushman who
dies of thirst has been written to death. Your version is
utterly bald and stereotyped, without the shadow of a
new idea in it “E.S.” (Brisbane); One mouldy joke,
and a disintegrated pun with softening of the brain. Also,
the joke isn’t pleasant and the pun is offensive....
“ Heliz ”: A mere news item, and much too 01d.... “ Ben
Sun ” : A poor, battered little poem, mathematically cor-
rect, but with no more fire or energy than a fish-shop
advertisement “Bohemian”; You call your heroine
Maude in one page and Julia in the next, and her
lover addresses her as Polly. Which of them is she,
or is she any of them? “Echo”; None of
the old masters remember a boy of that name, but they
do remember a cocky lad named Simpson “Swan-
ston ” : The Age confuses German Nicolson, who kept the
grocery at the corner of Swanston and Collins-streets,
with William Nicholson, ex-Mayor of Melbourne, the
father of the ballot in Australia “Enquirer”: You
might look in at the office and ask ..“ W. H.”( Adelaide):
Don’t make your subjects for illustration so complicated.
That’s a 11... .“Othersider” : Thanks “Octopus”: We
didn’t know who sent the cablegram. We thought you
might be a member of the incoming Ministry... “James
M.” (St. K.): Purely parochial. And half-a-dozen things
of like length would take up all our space “ G.8.C.”:
It has been so much better done by so many other people..
“ M.T.” : Two sets to hand. One printed, we think, this
week “ W. Henry ” (Melb.): Thanks. Already noticed.
....“ H.V.” ; Glad to have them. ..“MiabeK.” (Knar-
bury, N.Q.): Screed to hand. Don’t remember former
letter ..." Kumare ” (Napier): Write “Price Warung,”
care of Bulletin, who will, no doubt, supply the infor-
mation “Arthur J.”; Already had it. However,
geniuses often jump together “ F.S.S.” : Thanks...
“ Lakomai ” : Not a very good case to hang a moral on.
Too many convictions against him..., “ A. 8.” (Hillston):
Thanks for letter “A Christian” (G., Q.); It would
only encourage religious feud “C. 0.”: Wentworth
had a penchant for Chinamen. Parkes favoured
Eurasians ... “G.F.M.” ;To hand. Little Pedlington
“ Harold Carr ” : Glad to hear from you at any time
“Wharf-Rat”: To hand .. “Herr Minn” (Melb.): Many
thanks “Wattle Yitake”: You tell in 12 verses a
story already told much better in seven lines “C.W T .” ;
The folly of O. Republican Dibbs in accepting a title is
best proved by the elaborate and ingenious pains taken
by his warmest supporters (including yourself) to find
excuses for his self-degradation “D.F.M.”: Good
“A.A.”: A first-class libel, prima-facie. You say a
report appeared in the local paper. Why not send it ?”..
“ 0.5.”: It was Gavan Duffy who once remarked that Parkes
was the only statesman in Australia, but that was said to
spite big John O’Shanassy, with whom Duffy had just
quarrelled “W.J.R.”; 173 Pitt-street, Sydney, will
find him “L. 0.0.”: Gold-miners never blackleg, nor
silver-miners either, so far as we know “ W.” (B.):
Yes, very acceptable “11.C.R.” (Syd.): Is it strictly
original? “ W.H.” (B.): To hand .. “Wire Fence”;
You have somewhat spoilt the value of the story by-
cutting it out of the Journal. It is the complete Journal
which would be valuable “W.T.D.”; Sheep-story
ancient and well-known “Boiling Billy”; “Miscalcu-
lation ”to hand... “Jacques”: “The Old Apple Tree ”
isn’t original. Why didn’t you say so? ... “ Hozzy ” :
Thanks. The man who publicly poses as the walking in-
carnation of any newspaper is never the man who does
any of the work.... “F.H.M.” : You say we “sneer at the
Holy Romans.” Well, other people say we’re Fenians.
Hard to please everybody —“R.C.” (Tas.); It would
cost about £lOO,OOO to do it “Queensland”: Thanks.
“Boko”: The Bulletin regards “prize-competi-
tions” as mere mean dodges to get literary or artistic
matter “on the cheap.” All the talk about “developing
talent ” and so on is claptrap of the most despicable order.
.. . “ A.0.K.” : What can be expected from a crowd who
start a paper to suit an idle plant? “P. T. Freeman ” :
Unsuitable ... “James A.S.” : Ditto.
At last she tells her story,
The result of sands and park ;
lie only mutters “Gory,
Hard luck on a poor funk-clerk.’’

OPULAR WATCHES AT POPULAK
THE WATERBURY WATCHES
have established for themselves an enviable reputa-
tion as ACCURATE, RELIABLE, and IN-
EXPENSIVE TIMEKEEPERS, and for all
practical purposes are UNEQUALLED by any
other low-cost watch in the world.
READ THE OPINIONS OF THE PUBLIC.'
Mr. JOHN J. HILLY, Beriwinia Downs,
Wanaaring, writes, under date 20th July, ’92:—“l
have worn your ‘ J ’ series and ‘E ’ series Water-
bury Watches, and have found both kinds to be ex-
cellent timekeepers. After seven years’ trial of
these watches I can safely recommend them to
anyone in want of a really good watch.”
Mr. EDWARD CARLTON, Peel River Co.’s
Gate, Duri, 11th July, ’92:—“l have much
pleasure in giving you my opinion of the Water-
bury Watch. I have had two. The first fell to
the floor from a child’s hand after two years of
keeping perfect time, carried every day on rough
mountain riding. The second one I have carried
four years, and have never had occasion to alter
it, it having always kept perfect time. For a
bushman, I am confident they cannot bo sur-
passed as timekeeners.”
Mr. FRANK' W. MILLS, Abbey Green,
Singleton, 9th July, ’92 ; —“ Without the slightest
hesitation I thoroughly recommend the Water-
bury as a good timekeeper. Mine has been tested
in various shearing sheds, &c., and against many
sorts, and yet never been beaten. I have had
this one nearly three years, hard riding daily, and
yet no difference.”
Mr. W. H. CLAYTON, Hillston, Bth July,
’92:—“l have received my Waterbury Watch,
‘L ’ series, which has been repaired by you,
greatly to my satisfaction, and at such small cost.
This watch I have had for three years. It has
been an excellent timekeeper, and I would re-
commend anyone wanting an inexpensive watch
to purchase from your company. This is the
first time watch has been repaired.”
Mr. GEO. B. MORRIS, Public School,
Laurieton, June 22nd, ’92: —“l have much pleasure
in stating that I have had a Waterbury in constant
use for about seven years, and it has given me
much satisfaction, being a reliable timekeeper and
standing rough usage. It has been cleaned and
repaired, and upon two or three occasions, never
costing more than 2s, or 2s. (Id. Twice it was
thrown down heavily by a child which caused the
need for repairs. It has just been cleaned, and I
expect it to go for two or three years more.”

HE DIDN'T ACTICIPATE TROUBLE
AN amorous couple on the verge of committing
matrimony entered a Paddington ’bus the
other night, and oblivious of the presence of a
third passenger, who to all appearances was enjoy-
ing a comfortable nap in t|ie top corner, com-
menced billing and cooing in dead earnest. Of
course the conversation turned upon the subject of
their approaching nuptials, and many were the
expressed anticipations of the joy that awaited
them in that estate which all are anxious to enter
into and not a few would be glad to obtain release
from. “ Ah,” whispered the fair one, suppressing
a mild hysterical sob, “ what a pleasure it will be
for me to listen to all your troubles and share all
your griefs.” “ But, darling,” rejoined the hope-
ful Romeo, “I have no griefs nor troubles.”
“ Oh, but you will have plenty, you know, when
we are married,” added she, with ingenuous
emphasis. The passenger in the corner coughed,
and a silence followed that would have tipped
down the scale at 300 pounds. The prospective
benedict assumed a thoughtful mood. Up to that
moment he had regarded marriage as an unmixed
blessing—a path strewn with roses—not even once
pausing to think of the discomfort attending a
pair of feminine cold feet, of an icy reception after
a late night at the lodge or club, of a colicky
baby with leathern lungs and a voice like
the shrillest of steam whistles, or of bruised and
lacerated fingers, the combined result of unskil-
fulness, a blunt tomahawk, and a chunk of knotty
firewood. These, however, are among the little
troubles that the average young man undertaking
one of the great responsibilities of life must look
out for, and the best thing for him to do is to
soothe the self-inflicted injuries of inexperience,
and to prevent the attack of chill or rheumatism
which shooting by night at lightning speed out of
a warm bed, and rushing wildly along linoleum-
covered passages in quest of paregoric will in-
evitably bring, is always to have in the house
ready for use a supply of St. Jacobs Oil, the great
conqueror of all pain. Mr. John Breakwell, of
Milson’s Point-road, North Sydney, gratefully
acknowledges : “I have suffered severely for some
years from rheumatism in my knees, and have
tried many remedies. I have found St. Jacobs
Oil give me great relief, and am pleased to speak
in praise of it.


Martinsville, N.J., Methodist Par-
sonage, “My acquaintance with
your remedy, Boschee’s German
Syrup, was made about fourteen
years ago, when I contracted a Cold
which resulted in a Hoarseness and
a Cough which disabled me from
filling my pulpit for a number ol
Sabbaths. After trying a Physician,
without obtaining relief—l cannot
say now what remedy he prescribed
—I saw the advertisement of your
remedy and obtained a bottle. I
received such quick and permanent
help from it that whenever we have
had Throat or Bronchial troubles
since in our family, Boschee’s Ger-
man Syrup has been our favorite
remedy and always with favorable
results. I have never hesitated to
report my experience of its use to
others when I have found them
troubled in like manner.” REVi

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Dear Bulletin,—7?e the recent letter in your
paper as to the ,wood-chopping contest at NyrHagee,
N.S. VV. The writer expressed disbelief in the wonderfully
quick time ascribed lo a lluon Kiver axeman. I have had
gi'eat experience in chopping, and I doubt if, under
ordinary circumstances, the time of 4i minutes for a 2ft.
block can be done ; anyway, the time last year in the
linal heat of the championship was 0 min. 22 secs,
(standing blocks), and somewhat longer in the underhand
chopping (lying blocks). Ic must be remembered that
the blocks used in Tasmania are invariably gum, or
stringy-baric, perfectly green, and very soft indeed ; these
logs would cut like cheese after “ dry, solid, box logs,”
such as your correspondent speaks of. There arc some
splendid prizes offered in Tasmania just now for chopping
matches, and I for one would be glad to give all particu-
lars and we come any competitors from Nymagee or any-
where else. I herewith enclose copy of our next pro-
gramme.—H. A. Nichols, lion. Sec., Latrohe, Tas.

Dear Bulletin, —Once wrote Macaulay: “It

The judge at Melbourne dog-show judged over
900 dogs'in seven hours, and was tnat day the best-abused
man in Australia. One lady, Mrs. Abercombie, led 10 St.

of cobies. All bull-terriers must now, it seems, be w fife,
long-headed and long-legged—by appearance made for
running, instead, as of old, for staying. At the present
rite of entries in the St. Bornaid class these dogs will
soon have a show of their own.

The’Frisco Chronicle speaks of Joe Goddard
as “ the homeliest looking man that Australia ever
erupted iiito this country.” And the Ciironiolk further
states that lie and M'Auliffe in their fight “displayed the
grace of two lumber-barges. Goddard’s neck and
M'Auliffe’s ribs acted as reception-committees. Alto-
gether it was as unscientific a battle as one would care to
see.”
* # *
The Glebe and Pirates’ semi-final contest for the
junior football badges at Sydney last Saturday was
marked by a brutal row. Mr. “Jack ” Martin (well-known
as skipper of the Sydney Harriers) umpired, and from the
start several Glebe players tried to intimidate him—pro-
mised to “ let out his entrails” and shrieked “ Bastard !”
at him. Directly he blew the full-time whistle a “push,”
who had been getting ready with sticks and stones and
bottles beside the fences, began business— pelted him
liberally and then closed in upon him and his few friends.
He was knocked on the head with a whip or stick, and
when he reached the pavilion was only semi-conscious.
Then some of the Glebe crowd wanted to fight him—the
result being that with a blow on the stomach and one on
the point of the jaw, Mr. Martin laid out one list, player
for three-quarters of an hour. The howling and shrieking
were something lo be remembered.
# # •
The trouble, of course, all arose through the
wagering on the game ; members of each side asserted
that the umpire had been bribed. Mr. Jack Martin will
umpire future matches from a round-tower fitted with a
Gatling-gun. Not a policeman appeared on the scene.

Pritchard, the middle-weight, England's best fighter, in
the fourth round by a knock-out. They fought in the
open, at Brighton, for some unknown reason. Hall is one
of Australia’s coolest and most scientific boxers, just as
gtoJ class at his weight as Jackson, whom he resembles in
style ; has great reach and a terrible left. Like Peter, he
is accounted too “good-hearted ” for the “ murderer’s
game.

ITHOS. MUDIMAN, Master Tailor, of 515 George Street,
, Sydney, in the colony of New South Wales, do hereby
solemnly and sincerely declare as follows :
Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome
affection of the Nerves, which affected me so much that
I was quite unable to attend to my business. I tried several
Doctors and many Remedies, but all of no avail. Whereas,
I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
PURELY HERBAL “UNIVERSAL ALP ALINE
PILLS,” which I hereby solemnly and sincerely declare
COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever
since.
THE ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.

A REAL MAN OF MARK.
“ Herr Rassmussen’s Cures are so remarkable that we
make no apology for referring to some of them. Mr. Rams-
den’s case is the most wonderful, and his remedies cured him
in six weeks, after many Sydney doctors gave him up. We
may also state that a gentleman in this district, who has
been a martyr to the demon Dyspepsia for more than two
years, after trying several “ doctors ” with no benefit what-
ever, is recovering under Herr Rassmussen’s Herbal
Remedies. Herr Rassmussen possesses undoubted skill, and
we wish him a long life to continue his useful mission in the
cause of suffering humanity.”—Kangaroo Valley Pioneek,
N.S.W.
A JUST REWARD.
“Herr Rassmussen, of whose famous Herbal Remedies
everybody has heard, has held the position of Lecturer to
several Botanic Societies in Australia; he soon became
known by the wonderful cures effected by his remedies, of
which he has numerous tokens of gratefulness, including a
beautiful Gold Medal, brought him into the front rank of
botanic scientists. We have seen and examined letters from
all parts of the world —are assured that he has saved a world
of suffering and cured people of many complaints, after they
had given up all hope.”— The Australian Workman.
—Sydney, 9th January, 1892.
WHO IS RASSMUSSEN ?
“ Herr Rassmussen is a wonder. Wo have sufficient
proof that his Remedies have cured thousands. He was
awarded a Gold Medal for his Alfaline Remedies, and ho is
author of some valuable Medical Works. We hope he will
be as successful in Victoria as ho has been in Now South
Wales.”— The Essendkn and Flemington Chronicle and
fJoRTH Melbourne Advertiser.— lst July, 1892.

Proving the Wonderful ALFALINE REMEDIES to
be Genuine.
“Herr Rasmussen’s, the celebrated Danish Herbalist,
well-known Herbal Remedies have been the means of per-
forming many great cures during the last few years, as his
numerous testimonials will prove.”—Sydney Bulletin.
“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly compli-
mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to
important cures effected by his remedies.”—Sydney Evening
News.
“Herr Rassmussen counts the cures effected by his
Remedies by thousands, has already acquired an Australian
Reputation, and has secured the respect and gratitude of
numerous patients whom his Remedies have restored to
Health and Happiness.”—“Centennial History of N.S.W.”
“We have been shown some excellent Testimonials of
the great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Cele-
brated Danish Herbalist’s remedies.”— Australian Star.
“ Herr Rassmussen is too well and favourably known to
the Australian public to require any additional praise from
Truth. His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Truth.
“Herr Rassmussen, we are glad to say, as a Medical
Herbalist, holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys
the confidence of many of the leading people of N.S. Wales,
Victoria, and Queensland.” — Cooktovvn Courier (Q.).
“It may not be out of place to mention that Hen
Rassmussen has now been established in the colonies for
nearly 10 years.”—Sydney Sunday Times.

Banjo, of the Overflow.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
I had written him a letter, which I had for want
of better
Knowledge given to a partner by the name of
“ Greenhide Jack ”
He was shearing when I met him, and I thought
.perhaps I’d let him
Know that I was “ stiff,” and, maybe, he would
send a trifle back.
My request was not requited, for an answer came
indited
On a sheet of scented paper, in an ink of fancy
blue ;
And the envelope, I fancy, had an ‘'Esquire” to
the Clancy,
And it simply read, “I’m busy; but I’ll see
what I can do ! ”
To the vision land I can go, and I often think of
“Banjo”—
Of the boy I used to shepherd in the not so long
ago,
He was not the bushman’s kidney, and among the
crowds of Sydney
He’ll be more at home than mooning on the
dreary Overflow.
He has clients now to fee him, and has friends to
come and see him,
He can ride from morn to evening in the padded
hansom cars,
And he sees the beauties blending where the
throngs are never ending,
And at night the wond’rous women in the ever-
lasting bars.
I am tired of reading prattle of the sweetly-lowing
cattle
Stringing out across the open with the bushmen
riding free ;
I am sick at heart of roving up and down the
country droving,
And of alternating damper with the salt-junk
and the tea.
And from sleeping in the water on the droving
trips I’ve caught a .
Lively dose of rheumatism in my back and in
my knee,
And in spite of verse it’s certain that the sky’s a
leaky curtain —
It may suit the “Banjo” nicely, but it never
suited me.
And the bush is very pretty when you view it
from the city,
But it loses all its beauty when you face it “on
the pad ; ”
And the wildernesses haunt you, and the plains
extended daunt you,
, Till at times you come to fancy that the life will
drive you mad.
But T -■'•"Anw often fancy that I’d rather not be
Olaney,
That ia nice to be the “Banjo” where the
people come and go,
When instead of framing curses I’d be writing
charming verses—
Tho’ I scarcely think he'd swap me, “ Banjo, of
the Overflow.

WHEN THE LIGHT IS AS DARKNESS.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The morning-tide is fair and bright,
With golden sun np-springing ;
The cedars glowed in the new-born light,
And the bell-bird’s note was ringing ;
While diamonds dropped by dusky Night,
Were yet to the gidyas clinging.
The morning waned—the sun rose high
O’erhead, until ’twas seeming
But a dazzling disc, and the fiery sky
Like an opal sea was gleaming ;
And languorous flowers—of morn gone by,
And coming eve—fell dreaming.
And now the moon above does creep
To laugh at red Sol sinking ;
While wakening from their sunlit sleep,
A few wan stars are blinking.
And thirsty, drooping flowers deep
Of evening dews are drinking.
The birds will soon their carols cease,
And crows are homeward hieing ;
The gloaming deepens, stars increase,
The weary day is dying—
Its requiem, murmurous of peace,
The vesper winds are sighing.
This night is near ! Are you waiting, friend,
That Night?—we’re drawing nigh it—
When we to the Restful Land shall wend,
And leave life’s feverish riot—
When the gods to each tired soul shall send
Eternal, dreamless quiet.

Rev. Sadleir Storey, a British magistrate
and Established parson, has been sent to gaol for
three months for drunkenness, chopping down a
door with an axe, beating his wife with the same
weapon, cutting her on the head with it and
threatening her life, dragging her around by the
hair, and then chasing the cook, the coachman,
and the nurse all over the house, with a view to
knocking their brains out. “ Much sympathy is
expressed for the reverend gentleman,” however,
according to a local paper, so he will, doubtless,
be released, on the ground that he is suffering from
housemaid’s knee and severe growing-pains, and
that confinement is injurious to his constitution.

“ One of the best speeches I ever heard
in my life,” says The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, writing by the mail before last, “ was
made by a Liberian gentleman, a pure negro, at
the Mansion House, on Tuesday last, lie was
followed by George Dibbs, who also spoke
remarkably well, and paid a graceful _ and
merited compliment to the representative of the
‘ Black Republic.”’
A lot of Sydney suburban parsons
called a meeting la.«t week to consider the distress
in the borough. A reverend gentleman led off,
with a lot of galimatias, about the propriety of
the clergy taking action in calling the meeting.
“ Who,” he asked, “has been so constant as the
minister in calling at the houses of the distressed?”
Voice from the audience: “ The landlord ! every
Monday, reg’lar.” Then lie tried another tack,
and talked sadly of the shameful way destitution
had been brought on deserving people by the
bogus banks and companies. Voice from the
audience: “Every parson on the platform’s a
shareholder.” Benediction didn’t follow just
immediately.
The Church, the State, and

Surely it can be said, looking over the annals of
history, and peering through the dim vista of
departed years, that no previous record has ever
been established such as has been obtained by
the Proprietary Medicines manufactured by
Mother Mary Joseph Aubekt.
His Grace, Archbishop Redwood, the chief
dignitary of the Roman Catholic faith in New
Zealand, has testified that great benefit has been
derived by persons who have used these remedies.
One of Her Majesty Queen Victoria’s most
Honorable Privy Councillors, Lord Onslow,
certifies that he himself has personally taken the
Medicines, and received renewed vigor from their
use ; and now a gentleman (Mr. Walter Bentley),
who has delighted the ears of Jarge audiences in
the principal cities of the Colony, and who has
obtained celebrity as an eminent tragedian, and
one of the brightest stars of his profession, pro-
claims to the world that Mother Mary Joseph
Aubert has conferred great benefit on suffering
humanity.
No one would say that gentlemen of such high
social standing would lend their names to any-
thing which was not reliable and genuine, and it
is a fact that these Remedies have proved them-
selves to be so.

Dear Sir, —I hasten to acknowledge the
marvellous results of a trial of Marupa.
On Sunday my voice was in a most ragged state,
now it is quite clear, and, vocally, I feel as strong
as ever I did, and all in 21 hours. It is wonder-

Dear Sirs,— You will note by my large repeated
orders for Mother Aubert’s Remedies that they
are now used in almost every household in this
town, and, I am happy to inform you, with very
good results. I find they have a larger sale, and
give more general satisfaction than any other
proprietary medicine. Send me a further supply
of the five shilling size Paramo and Karana.
Yours truly,

PROGRESSION.
THE vegetable medicines of Mother Mary
Josepli Aubert have now become estab-
lished as the favourite remedies, an 1 are the
result of thirty years’ hard study, combined with
the fact that nature, in its beneficence, has pro-
vided an antidote to every indisposition the
human frame is subject to, and which the Rev.
Mother, in her various researches, has been able
to discover hidden in our New Zealand vegetation.
The preparation known as Natanata is a
specific for Sickness, Vomiting and Diarrhoea,
three of the most frequent and distressing com-
plaints of females and children. Every housewife
who desires strong and robust health, should take
Natanata at regular intervals, and also give it to
her children. Its action is gentle and certain,
and no one using it can fail to be materially
benefited.
Nature frequently requires assistance, and
when the system has been weakened by sickness,
or protracted irregularity, troublesome, or even
fatal results occur, unless counteracted by some
natural and easy assimilated remedy. In sea
sickness, Natanata is simply invaluable, and
those who, on business or pleasure, are travelling,
should never be without it.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
And the two old cronies sat together over a fire of
mallee-root and talked of olden days. They had
been friends at school and had separated when
quite young to wander the world over under the
cumbersome burden of a bleak virginity, and here
in the autumn of life, when the hair of both is
white and their faces bright in the glad expectancy
of rest presently, they meet again and decide to
live together—till then.
Both had been governesses in good families and
both had trained and led gently into the boisterous
business of life men and women of public worth.
Both had been, as it were, children planting
acorns, and the acorns had grown into notable
personalities ; and the good old souls were keeping
their shrivelled hearts warm in the shade of old
associations.
It was curious to listen to them. “Great”
Haines that each night rattle through the cable
to add piquancy to the “ breakfast - table’s
tea - and - toast ” fell glibly from their lips
ni tones of perfect familiarity. Lord This, the
Luke of That, or Sir Something Somcbodj r , they
remembered us unruly children learning their first
declension, and every now and again one of the
old women would lie back in Imr chair and clap
her gnarled hands in the memory of some infantile
delinquency that made the young life of a now
potentate memorable to her.
They had been three months together and each
afternoon —the cups washed and the table tidy—
they had drawn their chairs to this same fire, and
each in turn had dived into the sanctity of her
heart and dragged a memory out to show her
friend. They (these memories), to ns who have
known something of the turmoil of this cyclone
they call “ living,” and have had to heave to now
and again, would be but little things-life’s
hhgree-work—but they -were their all, and one
would tell the other her little stories of small and
sinless loves, that shone out like fixed stars now
that their suns were almost set.
But each woman, deep down in her heart, had the
memory of one thing too sacred for her friend
even to know. Each in the privacy of her own
room had unpacked, day after day, this memory
and pondered over it, pining to share it. In both
cases it was, of course, an old love-story, a love-
story without its third volume—the rubble of
roken hearts that, cemented with tears, forms the
emulations of old maidenhood.
At this date over the lives of both of them there
« for months past a black cloud charged
‘j' wnancial ruin. One day saw its dispelling,
“'at afternoon the hope, dear to both, of see-
.£ England once more went wandering about,
'rring old centres, melting reserve, and tapping
‘‘Now, if ever, is the time,” each told her-
i as she stared silently into the fire, “to un-
til. i 6 one secret so long withheld ” —and so
j, clasped hands and each led the other into her
h( # of holies.
rail V ! ? er woin an led the way over the stiff
so I °* revelation, and told of a time
long ago when “those hands were
®l* r and,” laughing through her tears, “ I was
vie « bad-looking;” of the a'dvent into her
age of a young stockbroker, down for the
shooting; of his knickerbockers, moustache and
“ noble, chivalrous bearing,” of their meetings in
the woods, and so on and on, until she had made
this one oasis of a dreary life bright and beautiful
with the wild flowers of little incidents. “ God’s
methods are mysterious and His ways past
finding out,” the old soul continued in
slow, solemn tones; “it may be that what
is is right, and things are better as they
are but The sentence was never finished,
for, phoenix-like, from the ashes of a dead mater-
nity there sprung the echo of old hopes that
drowned speech in her.
Then they were silent for a time. By a common
impulse the hand of each woman wandered, and,
finding the other’s, they held together firmly until
they were brave again.
Then the elder one renewed her story in quite a
clearer voice : “ And my hero’s name was—ought
I tell you?”
“You needn't.”
“Why ?”
“I know him only too well. The same latch-
key opened its way to my heart; the same
‘ chivalrous bearing ’ spoilt my quietude ; the same
voice, sinking sometimes into almost silence and
then growing masterful, poisoned in me all dreams
of self-reliance, and—worse than all—ought I tell
you ?”
“You needn’t, love.”
“ Why?”
“Because I know' all now. I know how the
snake in him separated us and nearly spoilt bo{h.”
“But,” broke in the younger one, “you don’t
know all. You don’t know how, in the end,
he proposed to me, and my heart, bursting the
leash of decency, leapt to'its ‘Yes’—and that
evening that followed —oh! those hours!”—she
buried her face in her hands—“ that evening when
the powers that are and the dreams of things
possible satiated thirsty lips with the hashish of a
lifetime, and how the next morning he came back
to me with a face hard and older—there was
nothing of the hero left in him. He told me that,
during the night, he had thought things over, and
come to the conclusion that he was altogether
artificial and unworthy of me, that I did not know
him, and that, in the stillness of the night, he had
seen how brutal of him it was to offer the refuse
of a manhood in exchange for such a love as mine.
Then, in all sincerity, he asked if he might go
away to Australia for a year and work as a common
labourer on a station, and come back when he had
picked up and re-woven the threads of a lost
nobility. And then I let go what of the mother
I had in mo for the sake of my sweetheart. Eight
months after—it was when I was first out with
the Taylors —a letter with a Queensland post-
mark came to me, just half a sheet of dirty paper,
with ‘a mate of mine, named .Cohn Salthurst,
wants you; he’s dying.’ Then he gave me the
address, and said he would meet me, and I started.
I have no memory of the journey up beyond tl
intense heat, and my heart full of incongruities— a
winter-salad of bitters and sweets.
“The hut,” she continued, “ I remember well.
No one there but this hero of ours and the ants
that swarmed about his stretcher; over him one
of the saplings in the wall had thrown out-long,
attenuated, pale-green branches that were wander-
ing about the ropf seeking light—and all night I
sat upon a kind of barrel thing, and nursed him.
I won’t bother you with the story of how I made
beef - tea in a pannikin, and wrung out hot
compresses from an old flannel shirt, but the thing
that hurts me still is the memory of those eyes
—eyes that had in brighter days laughed love to
ua were filmed over and circled round with the
black border of coming death no, don't
interrupt me, I’ll be better when I have told you
all. About midnight for two hours he raved and
slept, slept and raved alternately, and the raving
was like the sieve of a drowning man’s recollec-
tions sorting out the big things, and the ‘ big
things’ were mostly women’s hearts —yours and
mine among them. It was a hideous compilation—
prayers and protests, revelations of a latent capa-
city for the greatly good that we, you and I, saw
in him, mixed with the secrets of its misleading.
“Oh, dearest friend of mine, I cannot tell you
what it was to have to sit there the night through
and listen to the tragedy of a spoilt life. The
moment the morning came I opened the door
and, leaning against the post, looked out upon
the awful silence of what they call ‘the bush.’
It was the end of that terrible drought, and a
dying sheep was tediously toiling on past the door
to what had been a waterhole, and a swarm of
black crows, that knew the place was dry, were
flying around him, or sitting on the fence chat-
ting all the while, or laughing satanically at the
prospect. Behind me his voice broke in now and
then ; and there I stood alone—absolutely alone—
and with the soul of me naked, in this laboratory
that Nature has set aside for choice experiments
in vivisection. A subtle something, a —may I say,
hysterical entity—an anaesthetic, made for women
when troubles are about, came into me, and I
lau’jhcd. My laugh stopped his ravings, and when
I went back I found all delirium gone. He sat
up in bed and looked at me inquiringly for a
moment, and then said : “ I have but poor accom-
modation for a visitor, but won't you take a seat ?”
I sat on the tub thing again.
“ You are better? ” I asked.
“Yes, have I been ill—or drinking—or-or”
and he was lost again, lay back, and tried to
think ; presently he opened his eyes and stared at
me long and steadfastly, as though trying to find
my counterpart down among his memory of things
that had been. Even my small knowledge told
me that he was sinking rapidly, each brain-centre
was giving up its ghost of an experience and they
were marching past in review.
“Presently he turned to me and asked for an old
portfolio from under his bed. I gave it to him,
and then helped to unpack two bundles of photo-
graphs. These he sorted out into two distinct
divismns and laid them far apart, one on the right
and the other on the left hand side of the old sack
doing duty for quilt; on the right were some ten
or twelve bright, clean, wholesome faces of women
clothed and in their right mind. Yours and
mine wore among them. On the left were as many
bold, bad women in different degrees of undress.
“ 1 le tried to lift one of the photographs of good
women, and his tremulous hand let it fall; I
picked it up, and, without thinking, placed it
among those nearest me.
“This thoroughly aroused him. ‘Doyou see
what you have done?’ he asked angrily, snatch-
ing the picture up and wiping it as though it had
been defiled—‘you are mixing blessings with
curses—sending angels to hell.’ Then he sank
back and rested. A moment later he sat up again,
and taking up, one by one, the good women he
had known, told me something of each. As he
lifted your photograph he looked at it long and
steadfastly, and then said, with what of breath ho
could collect: ‘I —loved —her —desperately —and
she—went-near—saving— me.’ He told me his
version of those meetings in (he wood that you
have spoken of, and then, with a sigh, he put it
down and took mine up, and—can you imagine
what it was to hear a picture of inyself as he saw
me, and drawn quite candidly, for he had no idea
to whom he was speaking? He went straight
back to one great morning—a morning from which
I used to date my birtli —and told me, as though I
was but an indifferent listener, of how he, on a
Scotch moor, had sat with her on rugged lumps of
granite, by the side of a spring that babbled and
sang to them, while grouse from the heather
around were calling, with futile persistency,
‘ Come back ! Come back ! Come back !’ ”
And then, with a little giggling under-current of
satire, he sorted out one from one side of him and
one from the other and placed them in pairs.
“There!"’ he said, lying back on his pillow,
“ there you have good women and their antidotes
—the alkali of this—(holding up my photograph)
mixed with the delicious acid of this—a blatant
daughter of sin—and the resulting effervescence is
the thing they call ‘experience.’ Don’t cry.
darling, we have fought together unconsciously,
but still shoulder to shoulder, against the infi-
delity of men’s inconstancy, and if we have lost
the battle we have not lost ourselves. Ought we
not to laugh rather to think that we have, you and
I, enjoyed the blossom and yet been saved the
risk of eating the fruit? But let me finish.
About seven, as near as I could judge, he died,
and a rouse about from a neighbouring station
came and dug the grave for him, and there a few
inches beneath the soil, over which starving sheep
run, lies this knight of ours. He is not cased in
oak or burdened with marble, but for all that a
monument of the fact that a wholesale crusade
against women’s quietude is not always suc-
cessful.”
Then the old cronies banked the fire up with the
ashes, put on their tippets, and went fora walk.

Sydney Sunday Tmtis wants the entrance
to newspaper-owning blocked by fresh character
and financial tests, but generously boasts :
We do not propose to interfere with vested interests ;
notwithstanding we are well assured that proprietorial
vested interests in journalism exist that it would he to
the advantage of society at large should be swept aside.
Just SO; It is the blackguard opposite that
ought to be squelched;
Womb's Schnapps has no injurious ingredients*
Wolfe’s Schnapps—Soothing and invigorating.

Told After Crib.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Bandy Carter sat with his heels braced against
the rails and his back supported by one of the logs,
and told his yarn between the pulls at his rank,
black pipe. The drive was already full of rolling
clouds of smoke, and the new trucker was cough-
ing like an advanced consumptive. Bandy’s yarns
were always popular below ; he had grown old in
the mines, but even when his experience failed his
lively imagination was equal to every emergency.
No man could use a pipe to greater advantage in
giving effect to a breezy or sensational narrative.
“ I was workin’ below in the Early Bird on
Chinaman’s, in 18—. The Hell Hole we called it,
a cuss’d hot shop, an’ wet enough to float a man
down to the plat. The ground was es rotten es an
egg, an’ es treacherous es th’ devil himself. My
mate, Hegan, used t’ make the sign of the cross
an’ mutter a prayer of thanks to the blessed
Saints every time he reached daylight after his
shift. One night when me an’ Tim had knocked
off at twelve, an’ had jest got comfortably to
sleep, the braceman came raisin’ blue blazes round
the hut. Johnson was white as pipe-clay, an’
shook so yeh cud a-heard him rattle in his boots.
“We was wanted on a rescue job ; the ground
hed come in on Brown an’ Porter, the night shift,
an’ there was the deuce t’ pay down at the mine.
You bet we rushed into our duds, an’ was on the
job agen in two shakes. They’d rousted up a
crowd already, an’ Miller, the manager, was
tearin’ about in a reg’lar blue funk, frothin’ at the
mouth, an’ orderin’ all sort of unpossible things.
“ When the push cooled down, an’ began t’ take
bearin’s, we sees how it was all U P with Teddy
Porter an’ his mate. They was choked in back
there, with half the country piled on top of them,
an’ no chance uv gettin’ a hand on ’em this side of
a fortnight. We might as well a-turned in agen,
an’ let the dead men wait—they wasn’t in no
hurry. But men never get real cool an’ reason-
able under them circumstances, an’ of course we
must peel off an’ buck in at once, pokin’ about
like blapik fools, an’ rippin’ up things,
“ The boss began to talk common-sense towards
daylight, an’ to get a grip of the bisness, an’ he
measured up an’ calculated, an’ when he spoke,
th’ two wimmen, who’d bin sittin’ about th’ brace
with their youngsters cryin’ all night, agreed it
’ud be better t’ go home an’ order their weeds, than
to hang round there till we could drive in from
the old shaft an’ fish out the bodies.
“We put in a crosscut from the old workings,
and settled down to graft, knowing we’d a long
hunt before us. There was plenty of stowage
behind, an’ by workin’ quick shifts, we figured
out to reach the mortal remains in from sixteen to
twenty days. Don’t know why men go in bald-
headed when they’re after a corpse—as if the
deceased were likely to get impatient—but they
alwus do, an’ every mug of us knocked himself
out in his four hours.
“When we thought we was drawing near the
Early Bird workin’s, a couple of coffins made their
appearance in the drive, an’ while we leathered
away in the face, those two awful, black boxes,
back there in the shadders, crept along after us.
T wasn’t pleasant-like to feel the coffins stealin’up
behind, an’ a feller couldn’t for the life uv him help
looking over his shoulder at ’em now an’ agen, an’
wonderin’ which he’d be clapped into, supposin’
accidents happened ; but we reckoned the men we
were lookin’ for would be in a hurry fer their last
final containers. When a man’s been dead in a
mine fer a week or two yeh can’t afford to be too
ceremonious an’ perlite about gettin’ him into his
coffin when found.
“On the seventeenth day we had reason to
know we were coinin’ on the bodies. We
timbered every inch of her, and went careful.
Hegan an’ meself happened to be on the job when
we broke through. We had struck the spot to a
hair. We knocked a big hole in, an’ I poked my
head an’ one arm through an’ toolc first look. The
ground had come down back from the Early Bird
face about ten feet, leavin’ a clear chamber. I
held my candle es high es I could, an’ looked
round to see if there was any sign of the bodies.
By the Lord Harry ! there was Porter back in the
corner, crouched down like a dog, with glowin’
eyes, gibberin’ at me. Brown was not there —on’y
a few bones.”
Bandy’s pipe was replaced, and withdrawn
again, and Bandy slowly blew forth a long, thin
cloud.
“ Porter had eaten his mate !”
There was a spell of silence; then the new
trucker spoke :
“ But how did Porter get air ?”
Carter looked surprised.
“Dunno,” he said, “I suppose the poor devil
never thought of that.”
SILAS SNELL.
Never refuse a nip of Wolfe’s Schnapps. It is
the best invigorator out.
Dear Bulletin, —There was a fatal acci-
dent and a funeral the other day in this bloated,
whisky-sodden, western town. A young man,
while driving a team on a lonely road, fell under
the wheels and had both legs pulverised. Ho lay
there half-a-day or more before ho was found, and
then he was carted into the township ; the doctor
did a double amputation, and the patient died
twelve hours later. There is no clergyman in the
district, so the burial-service was read in the
gathering darkness by the schoolmaster, with the
assistance of the storekeeper, only the storekeeper,
being near-sighted, stood too near the edge of the
grave, and, just as the coffin was being lowered, he
slid on the yielding sand and grabbed the school-
master for support, and the schoolmaster grabbed
the publican, and the publican grabbed the empty
air, and they all went down together right on top
of the coffin. After that the crowd sang “ He’s a
jolly good fellow,” out of compliment to the
departed, and went home. A few mourners ad-
journed to the hotel to keep their spirits up, and
had an average of eleven drinks apiece. Then
they grew uproarious during dinner, and some-
body, when he removed the cover off the meat,
solemnly put it, still hot and greasy, on the bald
head of the storekeeper, and somebody else
whacked it before he could take it off, whereby
the knobs on the inside of the cover were driven
into the storekeeper’s skull, and if they had gone
in much further the base metal might have
affected his brain. There was some unpleasantness
over this, but the publican threw beer on the
troubled waters, and finally the whole party
agreed to race down the stair for drinks, and an
adjacent squatter won, getting to the bottom
head-first and with a broken collar-bone fully six
inches ahead of the other competitors. He and
the storekeeper ate now doing as well as could
reasonably be expected.—Yours, &c., A Law-
Abiding Inhabitant.
The Southern Scout, or the Natives of
the Land.
Ye landlords of the cities that are builded by the
sea—
You toady “Representative,.” you careless ab-
sentee —
I come, a scout from Borderland, to warn you of
a change,
To tell you of the spirit that is roused beyond the
range 5
I come from where on western plains the lonely
homesteads stand,
To tell you of the coming of the Natives of the
Land !
Of the land we’re living in.
The Natives of the Land.
For Australian men are gath’ring— they are join-
ing hand in hand !
Don’t you hear the battle cooey of the Natives of
the Land ?
I’ve watched the march of Humbug here, I saw
each evil sign
With eyes that ran a banker filled with hot, rebel-
lious brine.
I saw the city mansions built on misery in slums —•
The March of Greed and Poverty far out beneath
the gums ;
I saw the southern slaver-ship go sailing from the
strand,
And listened for the war-cry of the Natives of the
Land —
Of the land we’re living in,
The Natives of the Land ;
But Australian men are coming for the rights
that men demand,
There’s the blood of many nations in the Natives
of the Land.
“It’s live or die!” you’ll hear ’erasing, “so let
the war begin
For the rights of man and woman, and the land
we’re living in.
It’s right or wrong,” you’ll hear ’em sing, “ we’ll
test it once again
Ere Greed shall rob the gardens where our mothers
worked like men.”
And Eastward shall the army come with eyes all
flashing grand
When Freedom’s marching orders reach the
Natives of the Land.
Of the land we’re living in,
The Natives of the Land;
They’ll sing a rebel chorus yet and play it on a
band,
For the spirit of the country moves the Natives of
the Land.
HENEY LAWSON.
*The writer wishes to state, for the benefit of the majority
of the English people, that Australians born of Europeans
have been called “natives” for many years. Also that
Australians are not all black) or eveh brown, neither are
they red. Likewise, that the prdgCny of Marster
“Jarge” or “ Willuiit ” as went “ abrftrd” and came to
Australia, are not necessarily little savages) unless,
indeed, the Master Jarge Or Wlllum aforesaid happens to
live \Vith a black gin;
11l N.S. W., a first-class detective receives
10s. per diem. His fixed hours, every day in the
year, are from nine a.m. to one p.m. for bank-
managers and company-promoters, and from seven
p.m. to one a.m. for work amongst the night-
birds. He is supposed to mix with all classes
and must frequent the Australia by day and its
antitheses by jiight, but not a cent does he get for
expenses. He must dress well, and be all things
to all men, and, strange to say, he is expected to be
honest and moral.
One Morris Asher, returned, according to
his own statement to N.S.W. Assembly, on one
occasion, by the “workingman’s vote,” writes
to S. M. Herald in denunciation of agitators,
stating among other things that; “It is useless
Labour fighting against Capital, it has no show,
for the simple reason that there is a far greater
stock of labour, not so with capital of which
there is not enough.” Here Mr. Asher runs up
against a stupendous truth. There is a deal
of spurious capital in the country, of real
capital there is very little. There are heaps
of parchment deeds to city lands that give
owners right to rack-rent tenants; heaps of
promoters’ shares in mines that represent original
investments recouped a thousandfold ; heaps of
the mining scrips that pass for capital, but are in
reality only so many gambling-counters. Yes,
we have oceans of bogus capital but the
real article is scarce because it is drained out of
the country by the absentee landlord and the
financier that has lent us shekels for reproductive
purposes.
In the “first days there were a reason 4
able number of corpses to be found on the long*
dusty, waterless road leading to the Palmer gold-
field. Coroners were scarce in those times, so
were policemen and magistrates, and cemeteries
were few and far between, and the wild
dogs, &c., used to take unwarrantable'
liberties with the dead. Therefore, the Go-
vernment announced that any person finding
a corpse on the road was to bury the same,
and on production of a certificate signed by three
witnesses, attesting that the deceased was real and
that he had been properly interred, £5 would he
paid by the nearest authority. The scheme worked
well enough for some months, and many a lost
digger got decent burial when otherwise he would
have been left to the crows. But at last some*
body noticed that at least twice a week—
often four times—a certain pair of diggershaino
in with a certificate to the effect that they had
buried a Chinaman on the road. It was regarded
at first as an accident, but when they kept
at it* and at last began to inter as many as six
Chows in a week, at <£s per head, the authorities
grew troubled. Then it was discovered that every
digger or sWagman who came along the road was
bailed up by this same pair to act as a witness at
a dead Mongol’s funeral, and always at exactly
the same place. At last a disguised policeman
took to travelling up and down the road, and four
times in succession he was called upon to attend
the funeral of a heathen and to sign a certificate.
The fourth time he put a private mark on the
deceased, and when next he passed that Way the
secret came out. It was the same Chow all the
time, and the pair had lived for weeks by
burying him and digging him up again. They
were arrested for fraud and body-snatching, but
the case fell through, and then the two diggers
left for parts unknown.
