Acting on the Liver, Bowels and Kidneys imperceptibly

FESSOK CARL STINEWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is still
treating with the greatest skill and success all Private,
Nervous, and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINEWAY’S great success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts: - Ist. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines and Fleet, ic
Appliances used are exactly adapted to suit the case,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I SEEK CASES WHERE ALL ELSE HAS FAILED.

Professor CARL STINEWAY, who has restored
thousands of sufferers to vigorous manhood

no difference what you have taken, or who has
failed to cure you. Cases that / accept for treat-
ment are quickly and permanently cured,
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION ;-Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the pow oof will and action? Are
you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of faint-
ing ; fullness of blood n the head; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful, with your mind continually dwelling
on the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation of
the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms? If you are afflicted, why further neglect

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, Diabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Board of H.S. W. House Sur-
geon to the Great northern Hospital. London.
I am aware that I am not strictly following the paths
Of professional etiquette by advertising myself as a
Specialist for the treatment of this class of disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
Chronic and Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph, Bov.
6th. 7th and Bth. 1890) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
therefore time that Legally Qualified Men entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
weapons, viz., Advertising.
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
from these diseases, who are scattered over all parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes these diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider, therefore, that by advertising J not only
strike a Mow at the Quackery which now exists, but I also add
to the usefulness of my profession and in no way lessen iny
personal dignity.
My Qualifications 1 invite the fullest investigation into. For some considerable time 1 was House Surgeon to the
Great Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of observing the mMty phases of the Nervous and
Sexual System, and to become acquainted with the most scientific methods ot ejecting their cure. f
My sole attention is given to the treatment of these diseases, and when a person consults mo he is in formed at the
commencement whether I can effect his cure or not- The patient Is not deluded with false and specious promises, and
If I undertake the case
I Absolutely Guarantee a Complete and Permanent Cure.
My great success iu the treatment of these diseases enables me to give this guarantee without fear.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. Ue has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hi j
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN
who suffer from the results of early follies, trans-
gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in

wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, and other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in

BOOK.
Showing plainly how all diseases of the private or
nervous system may be cured thoroughly and per-
manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
(ion and prescription may assist you in restoring
some poor friend to health even after his case has
been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.
ONE BOUND IS SUFFICIENT TO
SEND
for Remedies necessary for the cure of NER-
VOU S DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
gerous, it would be advisable for you to sit down
quietly in your chamber and write to the doctor,
detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, send for his famous medical
work, the price of which is but sixpence ; enclosed
in the volume will be found a list of carefully-pre-
pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
stances. The moment letters are carefully per-
used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
and patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and
themselves. Dr. Richards has successfully treated
nearly 25,000 cases since coming to Australia, and
has permission from at least 10,000 persons to
show their written evidence of his success. All

“In MIDDLE HARBOUR and other Verse;”
(Chiefly Australian)
By THOMAS HENEV.
London : Kegan, Paul, Trench, Triioner and Co
Price, Four Shillings.
In this volume, the writer has endeavoured to con-
vey his vivid impressions of the life and landscape
of the pastoral regions. Mindful of the admirable
work in such books as Mr. Farrell’s “ How Ho
Died,” and in the columns of some of the weekly
papers, the writer does not claim to have entered
an unoccupied field, but thinks it will be admitted,
by those acquainted with the scenes and persons
of his verse, that it is faithful to the virile and
picturesque characteristics of the life of the station,
and the powerful and strange scenery of pas-
toral territory. In a series of eight rhymed
poems, in three blank-verse poems, and in other
verse, it is sought to suggest the dominant features
of this free and vigorous life. In “ A Squatter of
’68,” an effort has been made to seize the dramatic
moments of the career of a pioneer squatter driven
under. ‘ ‘ Pioneer ”is an episode of the opening
of new country in South Queensland. Such poems
as “The Boundary Rider,” “ At the Tank before
Day,” “The Groom’s Hut,’’and “In the Lignum,”
are descriptive. Two poems, “The Shearer”
and “ Found Dead,” outline two of the tragedies
of the bush. In these and other verses, the writer
has endeavoured to utilise his knowledge of local
colour derived from residence and travel. The
poem from which the book gets its name is a
lengthy blank-verse study of camping-out, in
which opportunity is taken to introduce a sketch
of one of the most striking incidents of bush-life.
Of the miscellaneous verse not otherwise specified,
suffice it to say it includes ten sonnets, and
several poems of lyrical movement. The contents
of the volume are so far new that they have not
previously been published. They will make a book
of about 112 pages, which can be procured through
the leading booksellers as soon as copies are re-
ceived from London. Of the writer’s previous
book, so competent a critic as Mr. Francis Adams
wrote in warm terms in the Queenslander of
4th December, 1886, reprinted from Brisbane
Courier of immediately previous date. This
review was re-published in the most important
Riverina newspapers.

AOTION.
- The extraordinary reputation of Rowland s Macassar
Oil; Kftlydor and Odonto, induces some shopkeepers to
offer spurious imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the- principle on which each is prepared is confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20,
Hat tori Garden,’ London, and therefore it is highly
necessary to buy no Macassar Oil. Kalydor or Odonto
except 1 those made by them, and_which bear their
name in red ink on the wrappers.

SW CERTIFICATE. —One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugklmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 cotmilted
more than one doctor , and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but X became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
•nd of three months 1 was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, anil
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
luny healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.

SATURDAY, DECEMBER 27, 1890.
Veneered Savages.
Someone has styled the present era, the Age
of Shoddy. The term, being apposite, has
stuck. It is, however, merely one of a
generic series, all of which may be regarded
as equally applicable. The age of adultera-
tion, for example, fits perfectly. So does the
age of stucco : and so does the age of veneer.
The potent influence of the competitive
system of social derangement has debased all
texile fabrics. Every other variety of com-
modity which permits of falsification without
instant detection, is fraudulent. The archi-
tecture of the times no less bespeaks their
character. Imposing facades simulate stone
in stucco and cement. Even when a
front is of stone, the sides and back are
ordinarily of brick, and the interior fittings
of pretentious edifices are generally mere
lath and plaster. Furniture is constructed
on similar lines. The massive sideboard, the
exquisite escritoh’e, the shining
are alike impostures. Their variegated and
gleaming surfaces thinly cover some coarser
and meaner material. Anyone with a
philosophic mind who may in later ages
disinter a nineteenth century Herculaneum
or Pompeii, will, almost certainly, arrive
by deductive reasoning at the conclusion that
the people of this epoch were themselves a
race in whose character the essential elements
of shoddy, adulteration, stucco, and veneer-
ing were deeply implanted and widely dif
fused.
•' # «
This is a speculation which to the con-
ventional thinker must appear preposterous.
The people of this great, this wonderful
nineteenth century, a race altogether super-
ficial in morals, in essential virtue, and in
the polish of humane sentiment 1 The thing
is too absurd ! Is it not this generation
which has abated warfare between any two
civilised peoples of half its terrors? Do iu.fc
the heroes of the red-cross present them
selves on every modern battle-field with thei r
ambulances ? Has not the slave-trade been
crushed ; have not privateering rights been
disclaimed by all the powers, save the
United States * Do not armies of mis-
sionaries compass sea and land to make one
proselyte, and when he is made, do they not
make him tenfold the child of —Perhaps
the bast sentence had best remain incom-
plete. When we come to think it over, the
quotation doesn’t accurately fit in with the
general argument. Curious readers will find
the entire passage in Matthew xxiii., 15.
* # #
The misadventure in the quotation line
which brought our last paragraph to an
abrupt close has somewhat disconcerted the
order of our proposed demonstration. Or
perhaps it would be more accurate to say
that the demonstration has been precipi-
tated. We may as well avow, at this
stage, that the subject most prominently
in our thoughts is the Darkest Africa
disclosure now under development. The
civilised world applauded when it learned
that Mr. Stanley, the distinguished,
the adventurous, the successful explorer,
was about to plunge once again into the
heart of Africa on a mission of rescue. The
tragic and dramatic incidents connected with
the fate of Gordon had invested the lot of
his surviving lieutenant, isolated in the
centre of Africa, hemmed in by hostile
tribes, and menaced by the victorious
dervishes, flushed with their triumph of
Khartoum, with peculiar and romantic in-
terest. The idea that a private adventurer,
with merely the equipment of an exploring
expedition, had undertaken to traverse half
of a continent, by ways untried and through
regions and races unknown, and to extricate
from the farthest and most labyrinthine
recesses of Africa, Emin Pasha, staggered
people by the sublimity of its effrontery.
The announced object stamped the expedi-
tion with a character almost holy. The
presumedly pacific nature of the party im-
parted to' the enterprise something of the
sacredness of a pilgrimage. Mr. Stanley
and companions were supposed to go forth
almost, as it were, with their scrip and their
staff, on an errand of mercy, with
‘■good will towards men” written on their
hearts. There had been nothing like
it since the fabled quest of the
Holy Grail, an enterprise which only the
pure in heart might hope to achieve. The
crusades were but gross performances, by
comparison. Everyone knew how largely
sordid and carnal objects obtruded into those
excursions. The Emin Pasha relief expedi-
tion was free from such degrading intrusions.
In its conception, the only elements were
disinterestedness, humane sentiment and
courage. No wonder that the soul of Exeter
Hall was moved within it as Mr. Stanley,
the lion-hearted, disappeared into darkest
Africa, sturdy, brown-haired, and with a
Bible clasped to his bosom !
* * *
No wonder that when this extraordinary
man emerged at the other side of the conti-
nent, after a lapse of time sufficient to excite
breathless suspense as to his fate, crowned
with success, with Emin rescued, but, alas !
himself with locks of silver, blanched by the
perils and hardships unspeakable which he
had encountered and surmounted, no wonder
that the very bowels of Exeter Hall yearned
for him, especially when he announced that
he had read the Bible three times through
during his tremendous transit. No wonder
that the very heart of humanity beat im-
pulsively as the outlines of his exploits were
told. No wonder that that gilded thing,
Society, took him to its spangled bosom,
and made of him a “lion” more popular
than Gordon Cummino, or the Shah, or
even Buffalo Bill.
» # #
But when the first clamour of acclamation
had somewhat abated, notes of discordance
were heard. It is curious, muttered some,
when you come to think of it, that Emin
should not have wanted to be rescued, after
all. It is particularly odd that the rescued
man should, as soon as he got over his acci-
dent, have just turned his back upon his
Saviour and proceeded at once to return
to the place and people he was rescued
from. Presently, too, there were whispers
that it was not Emin that Stanley had aimed
at, in reality, but a vast accumulation of
ivory which Emin had got together. Next,
an element of absurdity was introduced. If,
when the Prisoner of Chillon had emotionally
informed his hearers that “his hair was
blanched, but not with years,” and had pro-
ceeded with that remarkably touching story
of his awful dungeon experiences, some-
one had circumstantially stated that he was
really hoary-headed before he was thrown
into gaol, and came out white instead of
brown because he couldn’t get any hair-dye
when locked up, his whole narrative would
have been considerably discounted. This
was almost precisely what was affirmed with
relation to Stanley. He was a grey-haired
man when ho started, but lie was also so
much of a fop that he habitually dyed his
locks. One ot the fearful hardships he had
surmounted with the aid of his Bible was
the cowardly abandonment by an unworthy
companion of a case of hair-dye. The result
of this awful experience had been that Mr.
Stanley’s hair turned white in a single
week, and no amount of Scripture-reading
had potency to avert that sad catastrophe.
The great man’s locks were “ shoddy.”
# # #
A circumstance which sensibly qualified
and tempered the popular enthusiasm after
its first fury had been spent in England, was
the fact that national sentiment had been
jarred in Germany, and that there a whole
nation, taking Emin’s side, scoffed at Stan-
ley s pretensions. Other staggering knocks
followed. The publication of Mr. Stanley’s
ow'n book was, perhaps, the heaviest. It
was most disconcerting to discover that the
saint and almost martyr was afflicted with a
most singular insensibility and callousness
with respect to the sacred ness of human life.
That, in effect, he was quite an Old Testa-
ment hero, and not in any sense a New
Testament one. That he narrated with as
much complacency as Moses himself episodes
very similar to those recounted by the
Hebrew leader. That Stanley took it quite
as a matter of course, as did Moses, that any
people who were in his way were damned
and abandoned by their Creator, and quite
at his disposal for slaughter. The wanton
shootings, the terxific massacres, the confla-
grations, the devastations callously recorded
in his own account of his progress did not
fail to have a sobering effect evexx upon the
most exhilarated fanatic who has been in-
toxicated by the preliminary dose of Bible
and Bubble which the sagacious Stanley
had administered to the pious public of
Great Britain. Next, Paul du Chaillu
showed beyond controversion that some of
Stanley s most sensational novelties were
not new, axxd some of his most telling dis-
coveries no discoveries at all. And presently
brave, downright John Burns spoke out,
and denounced Stanley as a mere fillibuster,
whose path through Africa had been'marked
by rapine, bloodshed, and devastation.
# * *
Now come the enlightening squabbles
among the survivors of Stanley’s rear con-
tingent. A terxific beaxxx of lurid light is
shed upon this part of the true history of
this Pilgrim’s Progress. As in the opera of
“ Robert the Devil,” a sisterhood of nuns
suddenly cast off their vestnxexxts and break
out into the abandon of nxei’etxicious caper-
ixxgs, so t his band of high-purposed rescuers
fling aside their scallop-shells axxd palxxx
branches and display their true xxature as
cruel and bloody buccaxxeers. There is Bart-
telott, the chivalrous, disclosed in his real
character, fit successor to Black-beard the
Pirate. He had men flogged to death, by
uneasy stages. He kicked his little black
page so that he died. “He was,” in the
simple language of a comrade, “ a very cruel
xxxan.” Then came Mr. Jamieson. No
man of war. A plain civiliaxx. He bought
a yoxnxg girl in order to have her killed and
eatexx, for the good and sufficient reason that
he had a taste—not for her flesh, indeed—
but for Art. He wished to embellish his
collection with sketches of an act of canni-
balism, from his own pencil. He was proud
of his sketches, and showed them with conx-
placency to his comrades. It is to be
inferred that he knew whom he had to do
with. Stanley has not coixtradicted these
statements. On the contrary, after they
were made, he declared his intention of
disclosing the facts relative to the rear
detachment. What horrors can be added to
those already known it is impossible to con-
ceive. Imagination revolts from the penance
of conceiving worse things.
# * #
Thus far, however, the pxxblic have learned
only what the survivors have found it
necessary to admit with respect to the
deceased leadex’s of detachments. As it is
vain to look for the evidence of the deceased,
with respect to the conduct of the survivors,
it is only to be hoped that the latter may fall
out among themselves and testify as to what
they know of each other. There is a curious
reticence yet on the part of Stanley in
x’eference to Emin, and on the part of Emin
with respect to Stanley. Ample evidence
there is that the two men detest one
another with a rancorous hatred. Each
speaks ill and contemptuously of the other.
But neither specifies his ground of dislike,
and each mixes a sop of eulogy into the
bitter cup of his deprecation of the other.
It would be probably interesting, although
perhaps appalling, to learn all that Stanley
could toll about Emin’s proceedings, all that
Emin could disclose of Stanley’s, and all
that each could narrate of every other among
the lieutenants. Barttelott and J amieson
cannot talk back from their graves.
# # *
Sufficient, however, hxis leaked out to
illustrate the theory that the modern civilised
man is like his chattels, merely a veneered
article. Major Barttelott, in a drawing-
room, in a club, or on parade, was, we under-
stand, an ordinary type of the British officer
and gentleman. Mr. Jamieson was a citizen
who on top of an omnibus differed in no
respect from the other dozen passengei’s,
travelling of a morning to their shops and
their offices. Remove the restraints of con-
ventionality, plunge them into a region
remote from laws, endow them with
arbitx’ary power, and the gallant officer
dcvelopes into fixe ferocious freebooter—who
freeboots a small boy to death. He thrashes
a woman, tortures men horribly so that they
rot to pieces from the injuries to their flesh.
The quiet citizen in the tweed suit, with
the agreeable talent for sketching, who so
axxxiably touches off a group of your sister
and your pretty cousin when he stays at
your father’s house oxx a visit, removed to a
forest and invested with power of life and
death, hands over your sister and your pretty
cousin to his gang, to bo dealt with, because
lie has a whim to sketch their struggles, and
ho lias you flogged to death with poisoned
rods for looking glum at the transaction.
The difference is merely that the veneering
is off. But is there much room for surprise 'I
Is it not the case that daily and hourly the
entire class of reputable citizens, murder,
rob and ravish ? Is it loss murder to work
a man to death, or to worry him to death
than to flog him to death ? Are tortures
of the mind less acute than agonies of
the body ? Is a bargain which enriches
you by the impoverishment of another,
different in its result and its essence from a
highway robbery 1 Is a systematic depres-
sion of wages, which compels girls to sup-
plement their incomes on the streets, in
order to keep life in their bidies, less a
ravishment than a direct enforcement ? If
so, in what does it differ to the girl 1 Woe
to the smug complacency of the nineteenth
century Pharisee. The high civilisation he
boasts of is but as the high polish of his
dining-table. It is due to veneer. Let an
accident but strip the veneer from nineteenth
century civilisation, and in Messrs. Brown,
Jon.es and Robinson, fair average
there will be discovered Babtielotxs
Jamiesons and Stanleys.
Christmas.
Eighteen hundred and ninety years ago the
Star of Bethlehem shone out over the barren
hills of Syria, to announce that the day of a
new revelation had come upon the earth.
It was an old, weary, dying world on which
that meteor portent blazed forth—a world
that was already drifting towards chaos
under the combined influences of tyranny
and superstition, lust of conquest, incurable
licentiousness, bloodshed, vice, cowardice,
and unspeakable corruption. The old faiths
were steadily crumbling into dust, and there
was no sign of any new inspiration to take
their place. Baal and Merodach, the war-
gods of Assyria, were dead and forgotten,
and the mighty tower of Belus, on which for
1300 years the sacrificial fire had burnt in
honour of the deity of Ashur, had gone
down along with its fallen empire and its
fallen creed. Nisroch, the eagle-headed
divinity, and his sister Ashtaroth, lay buried
together in the dust of the ruined land of
Shinar ; and Isis and Osiris, Anubis,
Horus, the sacred cat, the divine onion, the
stork, and all the rest of the holy lumber of
Egypt, had been swamped together in one
general smash in the temples beside the Nile.
The Greeks, having lost their faith in their
own gods, had planted their discredited
deities throughout all Western Asia, and
treading close and fast upon their heels came
the thunder-march of Pompey, who brushed
away the new faiths as relentlessly as Cyrus
and Alexander of Macedon had brushed
away the old. Even the divinities of Rome,
however, were old and gone to seed when
they began their reign in the new empire,
and all through the East there was a mad
jumble and chaos of creeds, in which Jupiter
was mingled with faint memories of Dagon
and Baal, and Venus assimilated with the
devil-worship of Armenia, and every brick
that was thrown anywhere between Parthia
and the Atlantic was bound to smash a god,
because gods were more numerous than the
leaves of summer, or the sands by the shore
of the Great Sea. And among them all,
lonely, despised, and almost forgotten in the
little principality of Palestine, Judaism still
reared its head, and the Pharisees dashed
their maimed feet against the pavements of
Jerusalem, and cursed with a great curse at
the surrounding nations, and the Sadducees
philosophised, and the Essenes roamed
through the desert and waited for the coming
of the Redeemer who was to shatter the
legions of the Caesars and begin the world
anew.
# * *
It was a worn and crumbling world, that
sounded hollow beneath the feet of each
succeeding conqueror. Rome was already in
middle age and had lost the fire of youth;
Greece was old ; Egypt and Asia unspeak-
ably ancient in their senile wretchedness.
Justice had died with Marius, and all over
the empire the land was studded with for-
tresses where prisoners lay forgotten in sub-
terranean dungeons, and every paltry
governor kept the torture-chamber busy
and , the cross in constant requisition.
Liberty was so utterly forgotten that the
world had come to regard its chains as pare
of its very existence, and a dull reign of
terror had settled down upon the earth.
Even then the vultures were beginning, to
gather round the huge, lumbering, festering
States of the C/ksars, though it was not
until several centuries latgr that they des-
cended on the carcase ; the Parthians hung
like a thundercloud in the cast, and the sons
of Thor and Odin were whetting their
swords in the forests beside the Danube and
the Elbe. A blind, lame, halt government
of lies and frauds, of tips and swindles, and
midnight assassinations, was growing up m
place of the old government of the legions ;
the age of warriors was nearing its end, and
the ago of pimps and eunuchs was nearing
its birth, and the hand of iron which
had held civilisation together was about to
give place to (lie hand of straw and leprosy-
The men of brains—the race which had its
exemplars in Scii’if), Hannibal, and Augus-
tus —were dying out by degrees, to give
place to tho men of fat and idiocy —that


gruesome race which began with Yitellius
and culminated with Honorius, the emperor
who reared hens upon the imperial throne )
and cackled while his favourites laid eggs in
the imperial crown. It was upon this genera-
tion of slaves and worn-out voluptuaries that
the Star of Bethlehem rose, and if the
Gospel failed to make the old world new, it
was because the world to which it was given
was too old to be capable of any permanent
repair.
* # #
For a few centuries, however, it galvanised
the corpse of a dead civilisation into a
ghastly semblance of youth and energy. The
dying torch flared up with a sort of artificial
radiance, and a long Indian summer inter-
vened before the sun of the old regime set
for ever. Even the obsolete gods awoke from
Jieir long slumber on their pedestals of
gold and ivory, and for one brief period
the effete system promised to wake into
fresh activity. So long as the Gospel retained
its original purity Christianity was a living
power upon the earth, and it retained its
purity so long as the pagans continued to
burn and flay and crucify its votaries, and
no longer. The history of the faith which
came out of Galilee was short and stormy
and unspeakably tragic. But Nero died,
and Valerian died, and Julian the Apos-
tate —the noblest figure in ancient heathen-
dom—perished “ by the visitation of God,’
and the Church cursed in their graves the
imperial apostles to whose opposition it owed
not only its prosperity but its very existence.
The paganism of the Empire became extinct,
and Christianity was buried along with it in
one common grave. Constantine, the
blood-stained assassin and crowned harlequin
whom historians have deified through all
the succeeding ages, built a new gospel out
of the ruins of the old—a gospel of gold and
incense and gaudy show, of bigotry and lies
and traditions and grovelling expediency,
and straightway the incurable old age of
Jupiter and Baal descended on the new
faith, and the great Church of the East
began to totter towards its tomb.
♦ « #
The old world went its downward way
possibly a little faster under the regime of
bishops and deacons than under that of
magicians and augurs. It flayed and beheaded
the last of the pagans just as it had pre-
viously flayed and beheaded the first of the
Christians, and the alleged priest of God
was a shade more bloodthirsty and fero-
cious than the priest of Melkarth. Slavery,
which had been horrible in the days of dark-
ness, grew more horrible in the days of light,
and a cloud of unspeakable gloom brooded
over all Christendom - the gloom of murder
and human agony, of the lash and the torture-
chamber—the gloom that rose from subter-
ranean dungeons where blind and mutilated
victims lingered in eternal darkness ; while
over this festering corruption rose the shadow
of the great Church which was run by pimps
and adulterers and buffoons —a loathsome
parody on the faith that came out of Galilee.
An external varnish of fat hypocrisy and
primeval muffle was spread, like a coating of
slime, over the corpse of a dead civilisation,
and the bloated, oily man of God became
the bulwark of the empire, for the soldiers
of the new creed had little faith in their own
Paradise, and objected to die upon the
Gothic spears and depart to the bosom of
Abraham. And meanwhile the road to Rome
was trodden hard by the feet of the vengeful
tribes of Germany, and along the highways
that led out to the East towards Constanti-
nople the earth was shaken by the mighty
march of the Persian armies bent on wreak-
ing the hoarded vengeance of centuries, and
over the fields of Africa the grass shrivelled
up beneath the footsteps of the Moor, and
the Christian hid himself in his walled cities,
and drivelled, and prayed, and burned in-
cense, and walked in processions, and won-
dered why his God would not save him from
destruction. There was nothing grand or
noble about his decline. He did not end in
a blaze of glory like the warlike heathens of
Nineveh, and he made no great expiring
effort as did that mighty Pharoah who
ended the greatness of Egypt and shook
every tower and wall of Babylon in his fall.
He merely withered and corroded away, and
the Moors and the Persians slaughtered his
bishops and overturned his altars, and threw
his deacons into the sea ; and (he alleged
Christians of Germany speared his priests
and jumped on his sacred relics, and of the
old world there was nothing left save where
the crippled empire of Greece still dragged
out a precarious existence, and waited for the
Mohammedans to come and bury its dis-
honoured carcase in the tomb of its fathers.
# # #
More than half the Christian world was
lost to the faith in that great cataclysm, but
in Italy and Central Europe a now Chris-
tianity rose on the ruins of the one that was
gone. It was a larger, coarser, stronger
religion than its predecessor, and infinitely
more enduring, but beyond that its merits
were very few. The men of Germany and
Gaul kindled their camp-fires with the
lascivious literature of Rome, and smashed
pictures and statues with their battle-
ixes, and they improved on the ancient
methods, inasmuch as they fought and drank
and cursed and plundered for their creed ;
whereas the men who went before them only
lied and snuffled and served their God by
midnight assassination. The simple gospel
that arose at Bethlehem on Christmas-day,
in the first year of this era, became a
rampant gospel clad in mail, which dragged
itself through mud and massacre, and spread
peace and universal brotherhood by braining
everybody who was not sufficiently peace-
ful, and hanging everybody who declined
to be a brother. Even at the outset
of its career its moral standard was so
low that it seemed almost proof against
degeneracy, but it found means to
degenerate none the less, and the Chris-
tianity of the eighth century —however bad
it might be—was still inconceivably superior
to that of the twelfth. The world grew ripe
for another reformation, and when it began
the Church promptly proceeded to burn and
flay and impale the reformers with the zeal
which has marked every Church when upper-
most. The story which began on the star-lit
hills of Judsea was continued through many
epochs of gore and slaughter, and wherever
the foot of the Christian trod the grass
withered, and the flower faded, and the
surface of the green earth was scorched as if
by the breath of a pestilence. The hills of
Switzerland and the plains of Lombardy and
Provence were drenched with the blood of
the Waldenses and Albigenses ; the Penin-
sula was laid waste by the Inquisition ; the
Huguenots and the followers of the League
covered France with ashes and desolation,
and the reformers and the opponents of
reform were equally unpleasant in their
modes of spreading the truth as it was sup-
posed to be in Jesus. Tilly and Wallen-
stein left a track of tire through Germany ;
and the Greek Church roasted and fried
and flogged with joyous impartiality the
Catholics of Poland and the Moslems of the
Crimean khanates. The Episcopal Church
in England preached toleration, and
massacred the Catholics of Ireland and
the Presbyterians of Scotland and the
Puritans of its own country indiscriminately ;
and the Puritans of America also preached
toleration and hanged Baptists and Catholics,
and flogged Quaker women in the streets,
while all creeds and faiths and dogmas com-
bined to jump on the idolater because he
knew not the God of peace and love whose
mercy passeth all understanding.
# * *
But the storm which had raged for 18 cen-
turies dwindled down at last into compara-
tive calm. The world fought and swore
and murdered for its creeds so long as it
believed them worth the exertion, but its faith
died out in the end, and it lost the energy
necessary for acts of violence. Europe
ceased to precipitate itself upon Asia for the
recovery of the Holy Sepulchre, because it no
longer cared a straw for the Holy Sepulchre
or anything connected therewith. The Pope
abandoned the offensive habits of anathema
and excommunication, for his curse had gone
down in price till 12 of them would barely
realise a penny in the open market, and the
buyer's bill at three months would be gladly
accepted without endorsement. The “ Most
Christian King ” propped up the Vatican no
longer because the last of the Christian
Kings had escaped in a cab from the back-
door of his palace upon a day of barricades,
and the heir of the “Catholic King” raised
the banner of the Church only to be wiped
out by Concha’s bayonets and the sturdy
infantry of Moriones, and the “Defender
of the Faith ” ceased to defend any faith in
an active sense, because his subjects were
coldly indifferent to the whole subject. The
age of diseased Christianity has merged into
the age of agnosticism. The Crusade has
degenerated into the bun-struggle, the
Holy League has been born again as the
Y.M.C.A., and where the mighty figure of
Richelieu once jostled with the stars the
Rev. Job Smiffkins now dodders in the dust
with a fat cotton umbrella and a servile
smile. Gust-avus Adolphus has been taken
and the Escaped Nun is left ; and in place
of the mighty figure of Mahomet the nine-
teenth century has Joseph Smith, the in-
spired horse-thief of New England. It is a
ghastly fall compared to which even the
arrowy flight of Lucifer thrown over the
walls of Paradise was only a second-rate
gymnastic feat of very small account.
# '* *
For eighteen centuries Christianity—not
the noble Gospel of Christ, but the earthy
gospel of His alleged followers —has been
tried and found wanting. The so-called
religion of peace has been spread only by
the sword, and where the sword proved use-
less it has not been spread at all. As
the result of all those labours Europe and
America have acquired a mongrel creed
whose outward symbols are the land-syndi-
cate, and the stock-exchange swindle, the
gaol, the gallows, the public-house, the
“ ’orrid murder ” in the cheap daily print,
and the last fashionable seduction case.
Even of this crippled and mangy faith, how-
ever, three-fourths of the world’s inhabitants
know nothing. Moslemism and Buddhism
are gaining daily in the race against the
bogus Christianity which did not come out
of Nazareth, and Buddha Siddhartha has
better promise of rearing his throne in Lon-
don than has the alleged Christ— as revealed
by the modern missionary—of elevating His
sacred emblem at Benares, Except among
the European races, Christianity has gained
no disciples, and for eight centuries it has
been practically stationary. The converts of
Europe have scattered themselves over many
countries, but the great, universal redemp-
tion has not even begun, and the bright and
shining light of the Christian in foreign lands
has only served to make the Cross a thing of
loathing. Christmas Day in the year 1890
finds the cause not much further advanced
than did Christmas Day in the year One,
while its capacity for advancing is im-
measurably diminished. The fat, apoplectic
creed which goes round on its large, leaden
feet, and passes the plate, is in no condition
to undertake a Holy War, and, moreover, its
followers are not in a warlike mood. The
bang of the Salvation drum is the one sur-
viving evidence of religious activity, and
when the drummer gets old and the drum
bursts—what will remain ?
PLAIN ENGLISH.

The Case- of Arthur Rae.
The deputation which waited on a certain
bowelless official, who, by a strange satire,
occupies the position of New South Wales
Minister for Justice, in regard to the case of
Arthur Rae, now a prisoner in Hay gaol for
offences against the labour-laws, appear, from
the newspaper-reports, to have not only missed
the real points of their case, but to have done
Rae’s cause much harm by introducing theore-
tical and speculative questions altogether
foreign to the issue, with which foreign ques-
tions The Bulletin does not propose to
deal. It merely intends to again put
the imprisoned man’s case before the pub-
lic in its true guise—that of an outrage
upon fair play and a challenge from monopoly
which the democracy must take up. Rae
admittedly committed two separate offences :
he acted as the Shearers’ Union agent in induc-
ing the men at work on two separate sheep-
stations to break their contracts. Accepting,
as a basis for discussion, the unholy Masters
and Servants Act, it would be equitable that,
in default of paying the fine imposed, Rae
should be incarcerated for the statutory period
- — i. e., for 14 days in each case, or (the punish-
ment in each case being made cumulative) 28
days in all. But the magistrate decided that
Rae should go to gaol, not for two fortnights
merely, but for a separate fortnight in regard
to every man who had come out in obedience to
the Union mandate or suggestion of which
defendant was the admitted bearer. (The fact
that the alternative was reduced from a fort-
night to a week in the second lot of cases in no
way affects The Bulletin’s argument.) Suppose
Rae had been a bushranger, and had, pistol in
hand, stuck up all the people on the two stations
on one day, or on two separate days, with what
would he have been charged ? Simply with
having committed two acts of highway robbery
under arms. Suppose he had robbed two
squatters of a sovereign each, he would, we
presume, have been arraigned for having
stolen two separate sums of one pound each
—-every one will, we trust, readily believe
that he would not have been sentenced
to a separate term of imprisonment on
account of each of the 240 separate pence of
which each pound was composed. Rae is now
undergoing 128 weeks’ gaol for what we
contend are but two, and not seventy or
eighty, separate offences. Metaphorically
speaking, an old English capitalistic Iuav
is exacting from him its pound of flesh for
each of the pence contained in the pound in
dispute. Mr. Gould is “considering” the
matter. If he allows Rae to remain in gaol for
one single moment over the two fortnights
which, the present labour laws being adminis
tered fairly, Rae is liable to serve, he asserts in
presence of the workmen of Australia the prin-
ciple that a mere magistrate may summarily
send to gaol for two thousand fortnights—
seventy or eighty years—a man who has con-
veyed to a body of one thousand workmen an
intimation that they had better strike ! The
wage-earners of Australia don’t thank the weak
and trimming lawyerette who has been foisted
into a position which should be filled by a
strong and manly man, for his insulting intima-
tion that the term of imprisonment passed upon
Arthur Rae is “ perhaps somewhat excessive.”
On the contrary, they regard that intimation as
a blasphemy against Labour and a travesty on
Justice.

Parnellism and Snuffle.
Parnell is fighting an uphill battle against all
the combined forces of British cant and snuffle-
dom, and considering the size of his adversaries
the probabilities are that he will lose. The
results, so far, show that the uncrowned king
has made a number of mistakes that are almost
irreparable. In the first place, he went astray
with a woman of education and refinement,
instead of lying in wait for a little girl round a
dark corner, and then casting his victim away.
Apparently, too, he went astray for the un-
accountable reason that he and the lady who
shared his fall were devotedly attached to each
other, and this circumstance is beyond the com-
prehension of the great world of snuffledom ;
and he allowed judgment to go by default
because he was willing to swap his outward
respectability, and the opinion of his fellow-
men, and the approval of the parson and the
landlord and the fat capitalist, for the sake of
a woman, and nothing more. And on top of all
his other misdoings, he defrauded the moral
press out of some thirty or forty columns of
immoral details, and consequently many
“special editions ” were lost, and the chance of
dragging Mrs. O’Shea’s name through a vast
amount of festering sensation never came off.
Lastly, having resigned his position as leader
of the Irish party, and been unanimously
re-elected, he has refused to resign over
again, and has tacitly defied his critics,
But the attitude assumed by Gladstone
and Morley has scared the Irish party
into a desire to re-consider its position, and if
the choice should ultimately be between Ireland
and Parnell, no doubt Parnell, as the smaller
of the two, will have to go overboard. Yet it
is worth while considering that if the “un-
crowned king ” is to be ejected from his position
for his moral deficiencies, it would be safe to
eject an enormous proportion of the House of
Commons on the same charge. Immorality, in
general terms, is a joke and a pastime; im-
morality when it comes down to particulars, is
a crime. Immorality that is squared by a
cheque amounts to nothing, but immorality that
has not been squared by a cheque is ruin. The
seduction of a score of peasant girls would have
left either Parnell or Dilke where he stood
before ; but the seduction of a lady connected
with “society” stands on a different basis.
The latter may be conspicuously and almost
openly the favourite of a prince, but to be the
favourite of a commoner is absolutely fatal. In
the case of the one it is practically a matter of
no account whether he is found out or not; as
for the other he may be found out in the
ordinary sense of the word with complete im-
punity, but to be found out officially is a
destructive circumstance. And the one thing
which cannot be found out under any possible
conditions is the moral law itself, for it is an
intangible and unfixable thing that passes all
human comprehension.
A Departmental Shadow.
The Victorian Railway Department has got
left on a cold day through the researches of the
new standing committee on Public Works. The
committee wanted to know, and the depart-
ment looked at it with a bewildered glare and
said it really couldn’t tell. It acknowledged,
however, that it paid some £290 a mile for
fencing, and other people got the same kind of
fencing done for £l2O, but it had no distinct
idea of the reason, and didn’t see any earthly
prospect of ever finding out. When it bought
land that was offered in the open market for
£3 an acre, it generally gave about £4O, but it
supposed this was because people usually asked
more from the Government than from anybody
else. Naturally enough the committee wanted
to know why the department didn’t put its
great flat foot down on this swindle, but the
department didn’t know; and when the com-
mittee further demanded whether any member
of the department would stand such a thing if
he were buying land on his own account, the
department didn’t think it at all probable.
Being asked if it were aware that it drew its
salary for looking after the public interest, it
admitted vacantly that it had never looked
at the matter in that light before. The
department generally paid Is. 3d. per cubic
yard for earthwork, while the ordinary price
charged by small contractors was Bd., but
it was pointed out that if small contracts were
let it would involve much more “supervision.”
It was the same kind of earth in each case, but
it was generally understood that earth at eight-
pence required to be looked at harder than
earth at Is 3d, although the actual physical
exertion of looking at eight coppers was much
the same as the strain of looking at fifteenpence.
When a contractor had finished a line, the de-
partment had generally to pay £20,000 or so
for putting it in working order, but they paid
the contractor just the same. There had been
sixteen refrigerating cars built for the convey-
ance of butter, and meanwhile the butter was
being carried in open trucks while the re-
frigerating cars were used for the conveyance of
oats, but whether oats wanted to be refrigerated
the department didn’t know. The principal
boss engineer said that if the line to Bruthen
was built on the narrow-gauge principle it
would save £lll,OOO, and the principal survey-
ing gaffer said it would only save £15,000.
They didn’t think the discrepancy was worth
arguing about, anyhow, and the leading pam-
pered menial of the construction branch was of
the same opinion. One of them had guessed
his figures, and the other fellow couldn’t recol-
lect how he arrived at his, but he thought they
grew upon him by a gradual process, like dirt or
moss or barnacles, and then a third man came
in and struck a general average out of his head.
Next the committee asked for some information
about a bridge that was being built over a river
somewhere, but the leading officer of the
bridge department had never heard of it, and
when he was asked if it was true that it would
block navigation, he stated regretfully that he
didn’t know; and when he was asked if the
local inhabitants were raising Gehenna over it,
he remarked that he couldn’t tell. The rest of
the witnesses were even more impalpable, and
when the chairman rose at last in uncon-
trollable indignation, and demanded whether
anything in the whole department was what it
seemed to be, or whether everything was
really something else, the testifier then before
the court only hauled up his collar and
vacantly replied that it was, and being asked
what it was, he lighted up with a great, glad
smile of intelligence, and answered “Yes.”
The horrible indefiniteness of the railway office
had infected everybody right down to the char-
woman, and none of them knew anything.

Concerning' a Commission.
The first great principle of statesmanship is to
get its salary raised, and the second is to shove
the responsibility on to somebody else, and
when, here and there, a statesman appears who
is possessed of three principles, the third one
consists in lying low and not committing him-
self. Consequently, whenever a great social or
political problem arises, it is the business of the
politician to make a stupendous but unavailing
effort to deal with it, and at the same time to
be prevented by unforeseen circumstances from
ever doing so. The problem of Capital and
Labour is the snag ahead in modern politics,
and as the most convenient way of rushing
boldly at the difficulty and never getting there
the Parkes Government has appointed a mild
and respectable Commission to shove back the
sea and hold up the deluge. Its business is to
inquire into the cause of strikes in the past and
find means to prevent them in the future, and
it consists principally of plain, fat, dull indi-
viduals, whose ideas are limited to orthodoxy
and prayer, and the sanctity of property, and
the necessity for doing nothing contrary to the
habits and customs of their forefathers. It is
filled with the solemn, commonplace spirit of
the retail tailor and the undertaker, and the
purpose of its existence is to find out how an
irresistible force may crash up against an im-
movable object without doing any damage or
creating a row. The capitalist owns the earth,


Christinas is hero ; you’ll want it badly.
Now is the time to lay in a supply. Fortified by
Mar hall’s Tonic Nervine yon may face undaunt-
edly any home-made pie.
Notice to Agents and
Otliers.
We regret that we cannot supply any further
orders for The Bulletin’s publication of “ Botany
Bay.” A second edition will be shortly issued,
when due notice will be given.

and the toiler has resolved to take it from him ;
each side demands the earth and nothing but
the earth, and, as there is only one earth, both
of them cannot have it, and each party is
fast coming to a resolution that it will
die in the last ditch for the sake of its creed ;
and under these conditions the Commission
proposes to settle the problem by giving a tract
and a heavenly smile to both combatants. It
desires' to shove a curate up against a rovohx-
tion, and to block a cataract with a hymn. It
intends to “take evidence” as to the best
means of reconciling Capital and Labour, but as
no one has ever found out any means by which
Capital and Labour can be reconciled while they
remain two distinct and separate forces, it
might as reasonably take evidence concerning
the best way to put everyone’s advertisements
at the top-right-hand-corncr of the page. It
also means to hunt up printed information on
the same subject, but the only methods to be
found in print consist of the abolition of the
mere capitalist and the land-monopolist so as to
make room for Labour, or the summary ex-
tinction of the revolutionary labourer by the
agency of guns and bayonets to make room for
Capital. The only thing the commission can do
is to snuffle aimlessly between these two alterna-
tives, and advise both parties to work and pray
and be contented, and the men by whom the
commission was created have sent out a police-
man to arrest the ocean. And as for the result
there will be the usual ponderous report of
1247 pages in which the members humbly
recommend that the ashes should bo removed
from the back door more regularly as a possible
remedy for universal discontent, and that the
working classes should turn in at 9 p.m. and
should maintain a respectful attitude towards
■ their betters, and that forbearance should be
practised on both sides, and further that dogs
should not be allowed, for sanitary reasons, to
sleep under the bed. Also, there will be an
expression of regret that wages are not higher,
and that rents are not lower, and a hope that
these things may bo reformed on some future
occasion, and finally it will be x’esolved that
1000 copies of the report shall be printed, and
the country will pay the bill, after which things
will go oxx as usual, except that the members of
the commission and the officials thereof will
have much swollen bank-balances, and vastly-
increased sorrows throxxgh axx over-acquaintance
with beef and varioxxs other fat thixxgs.
On Statues and Other Thing’s.
The London Echo xxxakes a small, plaixx, harm-
less observation:—
Major-General Bland Strange, who has been travelling-
leisurely in Australia, and taking note of everything,
quotes some elegant expressions from the Australian
Separatist journals. The Bulletin calls Gordon “ a
sainted nigger-butcher.” On the other hand, the people
of Melbourne raise a fine statue to this “ outcher.” So
that opinions differ—luckily. Again, the name of the
Hon. Mr. Dalley is pretty well known in England. The
Dalley memorial in Westminster Abbey is the first ever
placed there in honour of a colonial statesman. But Tub
Bulletin suggested that a more appropriate monument
would be the figure of an ass in a lion’s skin.
The Bulletin rises with a hollow-sounding and
mysterious cough to make one remark by way
of reply —namely, that a statxxe is no more a
guarantee of any man’s character than is a
porous-plaster, and a memorial in Westminster
Abbey is not a proof that Dalley was a great
patriot and a great statesman —it would be as
reasonable to claim that a shattered hat and a
copious stream of profaxxity wex-e eA 7 idences of a
profound kxxowledge of astronomy. The man
who gets a statue is sometimes a genius and a
hero, but more often he is not; the man who
gets ten statues is generally a fool. Columbus,
for instance, is somewhat badly off in -this way,
while Albert the Good absohxtely cumbers the
leaxx earth with busts, monuments, and pede-
stals. That dismal buffoon, William the
Fourth, shines considerably, so far as images
are concerned, in various British cities, but
William Wallace and Daniel O’Connell are
somewhat scarce. Brown, boot-polisher to the
Royal Family, is a good deal more conspicuous
than Robert Bruce or Patrick Sarsfield,
but any one who would judge from that fact
that Brown was a greater man than the heroes
of Bannockburn or Limerick had better hie
away to a lunatic-asylum before his disorder
becomes incurable. All the cities of Syria were
once choke-full of statues to Antxochxls Ex’i-
i’HANES, even in the days when that howling
drunkard used to gallop through the streets
disguised as a wild beast, with his harem rush-
ing after him and holding up his tail. A statue
is only a solid evidence that somebody has beexx
fool enough to put it up, anti a tablet in an
Abbey is merely a proof that somebody placed
it there. It doesn’t even prove that the pex'son
to whom it was erected had any existence, for
even the Devil has had statues raised to him,
and the world doesn’t feel quite so positive
about him as it used to be.
The Austral Salon has, with the customary
modesty of the female sex, enunciated as a
satisfactorily-demonstrated canon the principle
that, morally, man is lamentably inferior to
woman. We have not been favoured with a
statistical analysis of the processes through
which this conclusion has been arrived at, but
assuming the correctness of the assertion from
an abstract point of view, it is certainly incon-
trovertible that, practically regarded, man is
in nine cases out of ten more reliable in his
actions than the best of women. The reason is
obvious. The efficiency of a machine is in
proportion to its simplicity, and granted that a
woman be fundamentally more conscientious
than the avex’age male person, the depreciating
circumstance still remains that the complexity
of female character will usually render her
actions indecisive and irregular, whereas that
of man being based on one simple principle—
i.e., ambition or greed—call it whichever may
be preferred—gives him the superiority in
chances of success owing to his lack of suscepti-
bility to influence by alternations of circum-
stances or motives. The vexy multiplicity of
women’s virtues renders their conduct vacillating
and imperfect, and the results achieved nuga-
tory.

BJ6 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, Dec. 22, 1890,
My Dear Moorabinda, —
The worm is indeed i’ the bud when women begin to
publicly make nasty remarks about the clergy, and it is
ominous that in a crowd of letters, mostly complaining
about the workers in the vineyard, in the S.M. Herald,
some of the most cruel are from lady correspondents. The
leading objection that feminine Sydney seems to have to
its Chadband, is that he doesn’t call frequently enough—
doesn’t appear smiling at the back-entrance on washing#
days, nor attach himself violently to the knocker when
there is an invalid in the front room, as he used to in the
old, happy past. It seems that he has contracted a
pernicious habit of waiting to be called upon, which has
alienated the faith of several earnest sisters who fail to
appreciate the inwardness of a coy curate with a fascina-
ting clean shave when he is only visible in his own
drawing-room, surrounded by a covey of young women
who want the first chapter of Genesis explained to them ;
and unless the parson doesn’t re-commence his visitations,
the Church will have to stand from under—
The parson has given up calling,
And the ladies don’t want to have wings,
Where’s the point about Sheol appalling
(As the hymnaFso frequently sings)
If you’re shown all the “ bogies ” in chapel
With the choristers waiting to shout ?
Where’s the blush over Eve and the apple
With no audience hanging about?
What’s the good if you shudder at Tophet
Alone in your poker-backed pew
AVithout the limp hug of the prophet
To infer that it isn’t for “yew?”
Where’s the point in your bogus “ defection ”
If the shepherd don’t weep o’er your fall ?
They’re noticing in the collection
That the parson’s forgotten to call.
It strikes me that the cleric and the medico—celestial
and terrestial healers, as Shakespeare calls them—run
very much on the same principles right along. The
doctor who diagnosed the oases of all bis beauteous lady
patients at the same time in his consulting-room would
either have to mend his ways or take in his lamp ; and
the parson who tries to round up his lost lady souls in a
mob instead of saving them at one time in shady drawing-
rooms while hubby is down town will be sure to find one
shirt-button and a “Tommy-dodd” sixpence the full
extent of the Sunday collection.
“ When walking in the Gardens on a Sunday morning,
about the hour of 11,” remarks one of my beloved sisters
in a morning paper, “it is pleasant and memory-stirring
to hear the sound of voices singing hymns floating acros s
the bay from H.M.S. Orlando; perhaps it is still more
interesting to go on board and participate in the service,
as a number of ladies did on last Sunday, when the con-
gregation included’’—here follows a long list of fashion-
ables. How interesting and romantic ! So far as I have
heard, the Orlando, like all the rest of the Fleet, has
hitherto been regarded by society simply as a dance-room,
and it is rather sudden and comforting to now find her
viewed as a church. But I am inclined to suspect that the
fashionable creatures who use the flagship as a scene of
devotion are induced to go there from a variety of
harmless motives besides piety,. Whenever in future
I see naval-officers sitting-out their dances behind the
screen of waving flags, or meet “ Jack Muck” tacking up
George-street with a convoy of muslin on each arm, I
shall be reminded of how “pleasant and memory-
stirring ” it is to go to church on the Orlando on a Sun-
day morning. Most assuredly the very nearest approach
to Heaven that a good-looking woman can make by land
or sea is the morning service on board of a man-of-war as
a prelude to—er—looking over the albums—and other
social vanities—in the ward-room.
People who continually hunger and thirst after the
latest p’ints about etiquette now want to know
whether it is correct for a married lady to sign her own
initial—as “Mrs. S. Jones” when her husband’s name is
Thomas? Up to date it was only correct for a widow to
display her own letter in this way, and they are saying
that the Sydney “ society ” matron who recently wrote
herself down thuswise either intends it as a hint to her
lawful hubby to—ah, mature his life-policies, or else
doesn’t know enough about the hanky-panky of polite
society to be trusted to dog-ear her own visiting cards.
I am told that the Hon. Misses Estelle and Dorothea
Hope, sisters of Governor Hopetoun, debuted in public at
Melbourne Town Hall last Tuesday afternoon, at the
speech-day of Methodist Ladies’ College. They are
exactly alike, and Connie Gilchrist’s carte-de-visite would
serve for both. They have “blonder” hair even than
their illustrious brother. Not a speck of fashion about
them, but they turned up in their almost dowdy pale-blue
morning-gowns, as on ship-board, with little crape hats,
trimmed neatly with small red and white roses and leaves.
The interesting and infrequent conversazione held once
in every two years by the N.S.AV. Royal Society (why
“ Royal” I do not know, since British Royalty,' far from
being scientific has so far as I can read and hear, ever
been characterised by its addiction to coarse amuse-
ments to the exclusion of everything scientific), occurred
in the great hall of the ’Varsity at 8.30 p.m., on 10th
December. The attendance was a crush The main hall
was set with exhibit tables, mostly adorned with micro-
scopes arranged over trichina), liver-fluke, and other airy
trifles, and astronomical, bibliological, bacteriological,and
I don’t know how many more ’ogical specimens were
strewn around in a reckless profusion which brought
gleams of rapture to the far-off eyes of long-haired learned
men, most of whom combined business with pleasure and
brought their note-books along. Undoubtedly the draw
of the evening was Mr. Government Analyst Hamlet s
micro-spectroscope with which he detects blood-stains on
murderers’ clothing, and discovers what the last suicide
had for dinner and whether it agreed with him ; and the
way all the women shuddered at the very idea, and yet
individually applied a bright blue, brown, or bilious eye
to the small round glass at the top shows what a satisfac-
tion the morbid has for our common humanity. The
grounds were lit up with hosts of little coloured lamps,
and the laboratories - also thrown open to the guests with
practical demonstrators laid on for explanatory purposes
—were brilliant with Chinese lanterns. In the great hall
groups of palms and sombre-coloured furniture were the
only adornment—the penny-fan and paper-banner of the
remorseless “art’’-decorator not being allowed to spoil
the old brown walls. A daintily-supplied buffet across
the top of the hall showed that even scientists sometimes
feel the inwardness of coffee and ices.
“Everybody” was “there,” of course; what wmuld
not people do just now to get away from their
own society just for one blissful evening?—and the throng
was received by about six leading lights of the Society at
the eastern door, the names being announced by a hire-
ling. Lord Charles Scott (just back from a happy day in
the country) and Lady Scott, Sir Henry Parkes, on a
stick, with a dazzling display of “stars” and “orders”
and red and blue ribbons, probably donned to keep people
from noticing that his hair w'anted combing, and scores of
other notabilities, including apparently all the judges,
swelled the throng, which became rather too numerous
for the ventilation when everybody had come. As for
frocks, Lady Scott w’ore a handsome shell-pink surah,
high bodice, and train over a front of bouffant-pink striped
crepe, the upper portions of the sleeves of fine white lace,
the bodice finished at the neck with lace and folds of pale-
pink crepe. Mrs. B. B. Wise wore white silk and striped
gauze, white fan ; Mrs. Mitchell, old-gold satin and fire-fly
passementerie ; Mrs. Yanderveer Green, white corded silk
with front of crystal tulle. Mrs. (Judge) Backhouse,
pearl-grey moire and caruhia silk, cluster of ostrich-
feathers on the left shoulder; Miss Wilkinson, pale
yellow silk and chiffon frills ; MissGarran, yellow' silk and
fisher’s net; Mrs. (Dr.) Shewen, grey silk and gauze and
point lace. A plurality Of black gowns lent their dismal
presence to the scene, among the wearers of this useful
depressing hue being Mrs. Cecil Darley, in silk and lace ;
Miss Mary Martin, in silk tulle and jet lit up by a cluster
of pink pelargoniums ; Mrs. Garran and Mrs. Gurney.
Have you ever noticed how 7 strangely most people
behave on being announced into a large assembly ? They
breathe their precious names to the butler in a husky
whisper, as if they felt sure the whole company would go
away if they knew 7 who was the aw 7 ful criminal effecting
an entrance, and when the painstaking helot has hoarsely
announced “Mr. Bones” for Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones doesn’t
walk, but shies in, looking like a lost soul getting into
Paradise on a press-ticket and expecting to find it expired.
The positive rudeness of these embarrassed souls towards
their entertainers would be dreadful if it were not so
pitiful. I have seen women announced—mild, pleasant
creatures in every-day life—who tipped up their chins
with a haughty stare, not even returning the bow 7 of their
host and hostess. Girls who crowd nervously in in the
wake of a suave mamma sometimes negotiate the ordeal
with agonised eyes fixed on their welcomer as if he were
going to bite them, while others keep their eyes impolitely
on the floor as they zig-zag through the doorway. And
then the mistakes in the names !—the parties of three
who give tw 7 o baptismals to the butler ! It is a very
strange, Mormonish sort of thing to hear “ Mrs. and Mrs.
Thingumbob” loudly announced, and then to see a man
srail ngly appear, herding up two women.
The “ ladies concert,” held in Sydney Centennial Hall,
on 11th inst., for the purpose of reimbursing those dis-
consolate enthusiasts who, after rashly going bail for
local musical culture, discovered, at the end of the
orchestral series, that a £2OO deficit remained to be
squared—was a well-attended, dressy affair which realised
something over the required total. Nearly everybody
was in full ceremonial rig, and the spectacle of Lord
Precedence Scott sitting peacefully side by side with
Mayor Burdekin in the fauteils, lent quite a millennial air
to the glittering front row. Lady Charles Scott wore
amber silk and chiffon with a painted fan ; Miss Ryan
(her sister), ciel blue ; Mrs. Burdekin, pale-blue
silk and chiffon ; Miss Burdekin, electric grey with
corselet of darker velvet ; Miss Broomfield, grey and
cardinal touches ; Mrs. Walter Hill, black, lighted with
superb diamonds ; Miss Burdett-Smith, pale-pink surah >
and so on, ad infinitum —the satisfactory state of the
reserved seats being more largely due to the exertions of
the comprehensive committee of 163 ladies than to local
passion for melody at five shillings a time. The eleventh-
hour defection of Signora Link alone excepted, the con-
cert eventuated as per programme. Mrs. Yanderveer
Greene, the only lady soloist, sang Randegger’s “Slumber
Song ” in an extra sleepy, though artistic fashion, and two
special floral baskets w 7 ere presented at the finish (ori-
ginally intended, possibly, for the missing link) to the
charming Knickerbocker warbler, whose filmy frock of
cream tulle, gold sequins, and saffron roses became her to
a T.
Apropos to ladies’ committees—an indignant whisper is
going up that many of the women who are foremost in
the proceedings (on paper), their names high on
the list, let their efforts in the good cause cease with that,
while they talk loudly of “ our success ” if the show turns
up trumps. The glory attached to hanging on to a
“ committee ” is rather thin, but an advertisement is an
advertisement, and the energetic workers attached to
some of the fashionable affairs seem to think that the
drones who write themselves down and nothing more,
obtain “honor” under false pretences and reap what
others have sown. I hear that a sort of secret society—
to be furnished with the names of all “ professional com-
mittee ladies is meditated, to prevent them in future
from having an idle finger in the pie. What a storm in a
tea-cup, isn’t it ?”
The latest suggestion from the spasmodic (esthetics of
Sydney is-in brief—that a dozen society dames should be
<< at home”—one at a time—to their friends in the local
Botanical Gardens once a week, so that by-and-by the
general public would become so embued with the habit of
standing round and watching Mrs. de Potts Point
“receive” that it would come mechanically of its own
accord, and thus a pleasing custom would be estab-
lished to last all summer. The hygienic advantages that
would accrue to society pets who received or paid their
calls in the hot weather in the Gardens are also ex.
patiated upon, and the article closes, so to speak, with
three cheers Dr the cause. All of which is Arcadian, but
impossible. For one thing, “society” doesn’t pay calls
in the summer ; it either flees into the wilderness or lurks
in the coal-celiar with all the front blinds down until the
chilblain season dawneth. And in the winter the weather
is too erratic for anybody to vaguely announce that she
would be “at home” in the “Gardens,” without the
addition of “galoshes and umbrellas provided.” But no
amount of pleading will make “doing the Gardens”
fash’onable. Years ago “nice” people used to go and
hear the band play, but the company on the lawn became
too assorted even for Sydney, and the thing fell through
and has remained through ever since.
Miss Kate Pearce, of Tasmania, is responsible for a very
lively schottisohe, evolved under the dreary title of the
“ Mount Bischoff,” and rendered still more depressing by
a balloon-view of the mine, crowned with the photo, of a
patriarchial party named Smith, who is patron-saint of
the dotted semi-quavers within. Miss Pearce has kept up
the beat well right through, and the music is very
danceable, but the printing (done in Launceston) is
execrable.
I wonder when musicians will write waltz-music
straight out, without worrying about the “ intro-
duction?” Every waltz has a page of introductory
squeaks, which everybody completely ignores, and unless
it’s just for the “ look of the thing ” that composers write
bars of preliminary melody, they might just as well save
themselves the trouble. For nobody ever dreams of
taking any notice of these premonitory symptoms of the
valse, and even bands at public balls dash into the air
straight out, without tootling through a sort of semi-
“ piece ” before getting to business. The “ introduction”
is an interesting fossil, which flourished at a time when a
promenade round was part of the excitement of the dance,
but now when each couple plunges away at the sound of
the music, the musician who started out on the “ prelude ’
in common time to “No. 8, a Waltz,” would witness the
horrible sight of a number of people rotating with a pained
expression to four crotchets in the bar. Therefore,
nobody plays the introduction.
Speaking of waltzes reminds me that at one of the
recent Sydney public balls somebody picked up a
“scapular,” or Agnes Dei, in the gentlemen’s ’tiring'
room. An Agnes Dei—l may explain for the benefit of
the unorthodox —is a sort of holy charm to protect the
wearer from external evil influences, and the fact of a
man wearing his to a ball proved that he had been there
before, and knew where his little talisman would come
out strongest. It would be interesting to know how he
felt when his safe-guard slipped—whether his moral
resolutions went by the board, so to speak, or whether he
kept from spooning the fluffy blondes just as austerely
without it.
Quite the thrilling event of the socially hopeless week
before Christmas was the Sydney Liedertafel concert on
18th inst., in the expansive Centennial Hall. The great
throng was headed by Mrs. Burdekin, and finished off by
a small, tan-coloured tyke which sat on its tail in the
eastern gallery and tapered-off the crowd gloriously.
There was—speaking generally—no dressing, only the
sorry crushed nun’s-veiling gown, the flotsam of the
season fled, in colour grey, pinks, cream or brown,
adorned each she from heel to head. And some had
sleeves, some shoulder-straps, some arms were red, some
thin, somefat. Butveiling was the only wear—your Sappho
answers for that! The concert itself was slightly
handicapped at first by a wild, Liedertafelian instinct to
transpose the original score half-a-tone lower (which is a
nice way of saying that the tenori were as flat as pan-
cakes in the opening number), but they looked
so artistic in their boiled shirt-fronts, with all the vests cut
according to distinct sartorial idiosyncrasies, against a
back-ground of potted plants that one readily forgave
their weird preliminary. “King Olaf’s Xmas” was the
Liedertafel’s special effort, since it was so apropos to the
season and so vigorously rendered. Signora Link, Miss
Lottie Hyam, and Lucy Alltress were the extraneous
talent introduced to lend variety to the programme—on
which the management had wisely marked an “ interval ”
before the concluding item to give the iron-shod suburban
barbarian a chance to catch its precious tram without
disturbing the rest of the company. Signora Link, in a
pink silk gown draped in designed pink chiffon, sang the
“ Jewel Song” from “ Faust” like a syrup, and if she only
wouldn’t agitate as if she were bouncing a cradle when
the tempo begins to tear its hair your Sappho would give
her a hall-marked blessing as a Christmas-box.
There was no special “fashionable” frenzy over the
return of Mister Toole to Sydney Royal, on 19th inst., and
the capricious d.o. was patchy. A strawberry blonde with
her blazing thatch frizzed out in all directions like askye-
terrier oast a warm glow over the front chairs, and the
one “ sassiety ” person I saw present relied principally on
the amber-silk lining of her opera-wrap for effect. The
small comedian opened in “Paul Pry” and “Off the
Line,” and was supported by the same galaxy of youth
and beauty. Irene Vanburgh in a cream frock cut d la
Dickens—all the wardrobe in “ Paul Pry ”is Dickenesque
—looked younger than ever, the chokey quality of
Lownde’s unmusical voice made one think he was con-
tinuing to feel sea-ill, and Eliza Johnstone, Toole, and
Billington were the geniuses to whom the house accorded
special welcome. On 21st inst. (Sunday) the Toole com-
pany spent a ’appy day on the ’arbour.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

SUNDRY SHOWS.
SYDNEY SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.
Theatre Royal “Cinderella.”
Her Majesty's “ Dick Whittington.”
Criterion . . “ Impulse,”

MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR BOXING NIGHT.
Theatre Royal “Aladdin.”
New Bijou “ Dandy Dick.”
Princess’s “Marjorie.”

Sydney Garrick is a pretty little theatre,
nicely, not gorgeously furnished, of about the
same seating-capacity as the Criterion, and suit-
able for the production of the same style of plays,
Mr. W. J. Wilson, who, with Fred. Hiscocks, is
lessee, has painted a very pretty little drop-scene
(a view of the Lago D’Orta) and everything,
position, building and appointments, bespeak
success for the Garrick and its management.
Their chief difficulty will be the procuring of com-
panies to play the sort of pieces suited to the
house and the class of people that may reasonably
be expected to attend it. However, they opened
the theatre on Monday (Dec. 22) with “Moths.”
an adaptation of Ouida’s novel by Henry Hamil-
ton, interpreted by a really first-class company
from the stable of W, and G., to wit, Chas.
Cartwright, Olga Nethersole and Nellie Lyons,
all of whom appear for the first time in Australia,
Laurence Cautley, Edward Sass, Hans Phillips,
Jenny Watt-Tanner, Emma Bronton, and Emma
Gwynne

On Saturday night last William Rignold,
who went home by the Austral, was “ benefited ”
by a large attendance at Sydney Her Majesty’s
when the “ Merry Wives of Windsor” was played
for the last time, and his portrait, as Falstaff, was
presented to everyone as a souvenir of the occa-
sion. The mighty William, who is a universal
favourite, in front and behind, promises to return
at an early date with some novelties. This house
closed on Monday and Tuesday, and will be
opened on Christmas Eve with “ Dick Whitting-
ton and His Cat,” when Maggie Moore, the plump,
genial, pathetic and witty, will make her first
appearance in pantomime in Sydney. Moreover,
in the first pant, ever played at this house.
** * *
It is no new thing for the management of
Sydney Criterion to “take off” a piece ih the
height of its popularity. “Dr. Bill,” who hangs
out his brass plate for the last time on Monday
night, was, apparently, good for several weeks
longer. Right through up to the last night, it
was impossible to make sure of seats unless they
were secured beforehand, and Myra Kemble may
confidently reckon on getting another Sydney turn
out of it. B. C. Stephenson’s play, “Impulse,”
will _be staged on Boxing Night, when Maud
Williamson will make her first Sydney appearance,
and Geo. Titheradge, Fanny Enson, Percy Lyndal
and other favourites will reappear.

The gap existing between Potter and
pantomime at Sydney Royal has been made in-
teresting, chiefly by reason of its misadventures.
First, Laurence Cantley, Courtly, Cautely, Cautley
(the Sydney press is lavish of names for him) was
laid up with relaxation of the throat, and Robert
Inman played Denver for two nights with a
hunk of manuscript in his hand, despite which,
he displayed some capacity for playing the
part. On these occasions Hambro played
Geoffrey Ware very well indeed. “ The
king ” had no sooner recovered than his “missus,”
Emma Bronton, took seriously ill one evening,
while getting ready to go on. Maggie Moore was
sent for and arrived at the theatre only a few
minutes prior to the raising of the curtain. The
little woman, who played the part for a month
about five years ago, when Annie Mayor had been
disabled by an accident at Katoomba, got through
like a workman, without hitch or stumble, and
gave every line its due value. The only flaw in
her performance was the over-vigour with which
she defied Coombes in the hut-scene. It suggested
a randy, not a lady in reduced circumstances. (As
Emma Bronton did not recover, Maggie played the
part on the last two nights of the advertised season,
as also on the evening when Comedian Toole,
delayed by head-winds, arrived too late from New
Zealand, and grievously disappointed a number of
fat aldermen waiting to interview him, who did
not neglect, however, to interview the fat supper
intended for him. Toole, who will probably end his
career as asuburban mayor, madehis re-appearance
on Friday in “ Paul Pry ” and “Off the Line,” two
of his best performances up to date, though both
pieces were played in a rather flabby manner.
New Zealand beef and beer seems to agree with
the company, who seem much improved, physi-
cally, but it is difficult to say what would improve
them histrionically. The Toole season lasts, with
the aid of “Dearer than Life,” etc., till Christmas
Eve, and “Cinderella” will shove on the glass
slipper on Boxing Night.

Melbourne humanitarians are up in arms
because an expert says the poor alligator in the
aquarium is wasting and pining away for the want
of live fowls, kittens, and puppy dogs, the open-
countenanced chap being like Lydia Languish in
the play, when she refused to have a marriage with-
out an elopement—in other words, he must have
live game, kill it himself, and get no cagmag of
old steak. But what a fine old tearful crocodile is
dear Sister Grundy, who chucks the infanticided
kids to the three-headed dog Cerberus, guarding
the gates of Tophet, where Satan jobs them with
his spiky trident for all eternity, and serve the
wicked little devils right.

Things go on much the same as usual at
Sydney Cyclorama, except that the old man who
fought at Gettysburg has not so much room to
point out to his grandchildren the tree behind
which he dodged the bullets on that memorable
occasion, nor has the lecturer so much time to
apologise to him for the unintentional omission of
his classic mug from the canvas.

Wo are informed by Manager Larmour
that he has engaged Signor Gurnia (the bird-
imitator), Madame Shields (the iron-jawed lady
who recently made a wonderful descent from the
dome by her teeth), the baby slack-wire-walker,
and other novelties for the Coogee Aquarium dur-
ing the holiday season.
*» » »
The only Wyburd has engaged, we are
told, a full minstrel company for Bondi aquarium
at this joyful period, and numerous other enter-
tainments will be given. At his King-street hall,
the Circassian youth, who sings and fiddles
divinely, Henier's orchestra, and Lilian, the child-
thot, are billed.
The shadow of approaching Christmas has
darkled (new word) over Melbourne shows these
last few days, and a large proportion of public
money has drifted from the drama to be invested
in the fatted goose. At the Opera House, how-
ever, the story of Madame Angot’s daughter has
been cordially received by admirers of that smart
game chicken, whilst “The Squire”—a much
stronger performance that of two years ago—kept
the Bijou comfortably filled all last week.
“ Madame Angot ” runs on until Christmas Eve,
but the Brough-Bouoicault production gracefully
withdrew itself after Saturday, leaving the Bijou
to the mercy of two unprofessional companies.
To-night (23rd Deo.) the Chilperic Amateurs will
endeavour to face the foe manfully instead of
warbling at their boots as on a recent occasion.
To-morrow the Associated Dramatic Clubs —the
very clotted cream of unchallenged talent—will
attack ‘ 1 Partners for Life ” and may Heaven have
mercy upon their souls. This is the proper time
for peace on earth, but some pieces are very hard
to digest.
** * *
The variety shows are likewise laying
themselves out to make the welkin ring. Prank
Clark has a liberal assemblage of legs at the
Gaiety, and the Victoria Hall minstrels are in
their 30th week of the ghost’s walk. At the
Exhibition and Masonic Hall there will be con-
certs of a dimly religious character on Christmas
Day, and the Oyclorama goes on rejoicing as
usual. Lastly, comes the Fasting Felix, of the
Waxworks, who grows more wan and interesting
to the ladies every hour. Many a fair creature will
breathe a sigh for Felix over her second plateful
of pudding, for the young man is unmarried, and
the little that is left of him looks yery nice. The
fact that his bowels (according to medical testi-
mony) collapsed long ago is peculiarly pathetic,
also the awful knowledge that two ounces of
corned beef would, under present circumstances,
entail his sudden death is calculated to make the
public heart bow down. Felix struggles along
satisfactorily in an arm-chair, all the same. He
has fasted for about 29 days already, and as a
slowly-diminishing sneer at the hog-like gorgeing
of humanity in general he may be considered
cheap at a shilling.

The waning light of “The Gondoliers”
having flickered out last Friday, an unusually
splendid (vide advt.) production of “Marjorie”
was to occur at Melbourne Princess’ the following
night. Miss Frances Saville and Henry Braey
infused new blood into the company, and
“ Marjorie” was doubtless a glittering success of
the first water. But further details are withheld,
for the reason that our budget had to be posted
to Sydney before the first performance took place,
so if it hasn’t taken place at all, friends will kindly
accept this intimation.

Grattan Riggs retains possession of the
Royal flure until Christmas Eve. He has
rollicked through his good old repertoire to fair
houses, generally supporting himself in fifteen
other characters, and now he is resting, as it were,
in “The Colleen Bawn.” At the Alexandra they
have ushered in the festive,season with “East
Lynne,” the slow dissolution of dear little Willie
and his mother being reckoned suitable to the
occasion. On Boxing Night, or earlier, the
indomitable Dampier intends to curdle much
young blood with “ The Phantom Ship,” in which
he plays the one and only poetic Dutch character
known to the English stage. Dampier should cer-
tainly make an effective picture of the eternal
Yanderdecken, whose blood-red bark is worse than
his bite, but if Miss Lily wishes to realise Thekla
she must buy a flaxen wig.
** * *
Other Boxing Night novelties are “ Dandy
Dick,” at the Bijou, “Chilperic,” at the Opera
House, and “ Aladdin,” at the Royal, with Jennie
Lee as the little hero. The temptation to remark
that one never sees a lad in the name-part is
irresistible. It is nothing much of a joke—only a
poor play upon words, anyway. But it used to
make our grandfather laugh.

There is a lack of amusements in Adelaide
just at present, the Cyclorama being the only live
show. Christmas time, however, will bring about
a change. The Theatre Royal, which has been
closed for alterations and repairs, will here-opened
by the St. Maur Company; Fred. Neebe has
arranged for the production of a pantomime—
“ Aladdin ” —at the Albert Hall; Wirth Brothers
introduce their Wild West Show on a big scale ;
while a number of other quiet amusements will
keep Adelaide well occupied during the festive
season.

The battle of “ The Messiah” is being
fought out in Maoriland. Wellington, in the
North Island, and Christchurch and Dunedin, in
the South, were all anxious to arrange with R. S.
Smythe for Madame Marian Burton to sing in
the Christmas performance of “The Messiah.”
The lady has accepted engagements from two of
these cities. After singing with the Motett
Society in Christchurch on Friday, 18th, she
sings on the Monday and Tuesday following at
two sacred concerts in the Wellington Opera
House with the Harmonic Society, of which
Encore Parker is conductor.
At Poverty Point.
The Melbourne and Sydney pantomimes, nowadays, can
only go the round of three or four subjects. In the
palmy days of pantomime look at the vast range of
nursery lore that used to be explored in London when
pantomime ruled the roast all round at Christmas. Blan-
chard, Nelson Lee, Byron, the Broughs, Talfourd, Buck-
stone, and other writers, were in full bloom, and Akhurst,
in Melbourne, held his own.
When Coppin had his row with Rev. Dr. Cairns, and
Cairns denounced him as “ a play-acting abomination,”
Coppin was the lessee of refreshment bars at Cremorne,
and put out a placard : “The Doctor has perhaps heard
of the Pharisee and the publican. Behold in me the poor
publican.”
Bouoicault’s second daughter, Mrs. Pitman, of New
York, has died since her father, childbed being fatal, but
the child is preserved.
The traditional acting lines seem to be getting obli-
terated. What has become of the Old Man, who used to
be indispensable in every piece, richly impersonated by
men like Farren and Chippendale in London and by
Rogers and Lambert in Australia? Then there is the
Charley Mathews and Billy Hoskins line—gone, while
even a droll like old Greville is put into an essentially sen-
timental part-Jaikes. The time will come round for him
to walk as the Ghost—again.
Brian Darley, who has been very quiet of late, was a
passenger to England by the Oratava.
In deference to the memory of Mrs. Booth, Fred Leslie
and Nellie Farren, throughout a recent brief run of the
“Ruy Bias” burlesque at the London Gaiety Theatre,
omitted their travesty of the Salvation Army.
A common newspaper-phrase runs—“ The amateurs
acquitted themselves very creditably.” The converse of
this is, we take it, “ The amateurs convicted themselves
most effectually.”
Editor Bulletin.— Sir, — l was always under the impres-
sion that the claqueur was an institution unknown outside
the continental theatres, but this illusion was dispelled at
a visit to a Sydney theatre the other evening. Somebody
at a little distance behind me applauded vociferously on
every possible opportunity (always starting the applause),
at times calling in a stentorian voice for “R !” Curious
to see the person who displayed such enthusiasm, I turned
round and saw—the man who takes the tickets!—Corn-
stalk.
From an Adelaide paper:—“Some one invited Lizzie
Hastings, of Garner’s Rooms, to sing at a concert in St.
Luke’s Schoolroom in aid of St. Luke’s Church, on Tuesday
night. Lizzie, with Bohemian good nature agreed. She
sang “Tit for Tat,” but that would not have mattered
had she not appeared in satin tights, with a satin cut-
away coat and a white bell-topper. Every holy eye in the
place that was not closed at once turned white, but the in-
cumbent, who presided, had to keep as Christian a coun-
tenance as possible. Lizzie sang two numbers in gay
style, knowing that she was giving her services and tights
in a good cause.
Boucicault, in his callow days, fervently admired Count
D’Orsay. In his imitation he set up a cabriolet and tiger
with the £3OO he received for “ London Assurance,” and
issued visiting-cards inscribed “Comte Dion de Bouci-
cault.”
“She may be an idiot,” said Suzanne Brohan of a
French actress, “but she is not idiotic enough to marry
a man who would be idiotic enough to marry her.”
Charles Owen, son of Henry Owen of the Bristol Prim
cess’, comes out to George Rignold as scenic artist.
Amy Sherwin is touring in Wales with Sims Reeves.
Charles Wyndham was born in Liverpool, educated at
St. Andrews’, and in France and Germany, and studied
medicine at Trin. College, Dublin. He went through the
American Civil War as surgeon to the 19th Army Corps,
and became an actor in ’63, when he played Osrick at the
National Theatre, Washington, to the Hamlet of John
Wilkes Booth, Lincoln’s assassin.
Some years ago, says a writer in New York Truth,
Clement Scott wrote a column in London Daily Telegraph
concerning Sarah Bernhardt, in which he deftly applied
choice adjectives to her gown, and juggled with clever
similes to describe her passionate love-scenes, crowning
her in words as queen of her art. Bernhardt appreciated
this. She sent an usher with a note bidding him welcome
to her dressing-room. When he appeared at her door
(Scott is a handsome fellow), she seized him with both
hands and kissed him rapturously. When asked if he
liked it, Scott replied: “ I might have, but I had brought
a friend with me.”
Shrieked a French actress to her lover: “ I don’t like
men who are too much master of themselves.” “Nor I
women who are too much the mistresses of others,” re-
torted he.
Johnny Toole is taking notes for a book on Australia.
Santley receives £2OO a night to sing in the States and
Canada next spring. -
Fanny Robina plays Aladdin in Manchester Royal pan-
tomime.
Mrs. Herman Merivale, who comes to Australia with
her husband, has w ritten a play for Toole. Let’s hope it’s
better than the “ Don.”
Some of the London papers assert that Sims and Pet-
titt’s “Carman up to Data,” music by Meyer Lutz, is the
cleverest, and wittiest, the most artistic, literary, con-
sistent, and refined burlesque that has been brought out
in London for several years.
A gushing American critic says of Ada Rehan “ Still
young, still tipped with rare gold, still supplied with the
warm gurgle of the nursling, her plush-lined voice was
heard from without, and she pushed the pink flower of
her riant face in view, and stood timidly twisting her
lithe fingers like a girl graduate.” Gosh !
David Christie Murray is writing a comedy-drama
which will be called “ The Gilded Snob.” When that is
finished he starts on a play called “ The Barnacle,”
founded on records of convict-days obtained in Tasmania.
These plays, “Chums” and one named “False Fire,”
will be brought out in England. D.C.M. intends to write
only one more novel, describing the vicissitudes of a
.clever fool, and that will be entitled “ Paul Armstrong.”
He says he can only clear, at most, £2OOO a year by
literary work, while a* dramatic success would bring him
£20,000 in that time. He prefers the great uncertainty
to the small certainty.
As a reward for singing at Balmoral, Albani received
from the hands of Victoria a picture containing portraits
of all the Royal Family at the time of the Jubilee. What

Searelle has taken the advice of the critics and shelved
Blanche Fenton for Julia Warwick and his tenor for Philip
Tomes, who made such a hit in “ Dorothy.”
Lawrence Cautley, now playing at the Garrick, some-
what resembles Bellevv about the legs. Like that actor
he has been a sailor, and visited Sydney eighteen years
ago, presumably in that capacity.
The share of comedian John Brougham in the com-
position of London Assurance lay in the suggestion of
sundry alterations. The part of O’Dazzle (Madame
Yestris struck out the brogue and the O' to put Mathews
in the part) was the one Brougham intended for himself
Edward Shuter, the great comedian, was a pot-boy in
his youth. A friend said to him once ; “ Why, Ned,
arerfit you ashamed to walk the streets with twenty holes
in your stockings Why don’t you get them mended?”
“ No, my friend,” said Shuter, “I am above it; and if you
have the pride of a gentleman, you will act like me, and
walk rather with twenty holes than have one darn.”
“ How do you make that out ? ” “ Why,” said the actor,
“ a hole is the accident of the day, but a darn is pre-
meditated poverty.”
Fred. Norton has opened a theatrical agency in
Sydney’s Victoria Arcade. He is a trier.
J. H. Clyndes, whose recent performances had made
him a popular favourite in Melbourne, sailed away for
Yurrup the other day. It was not until He had completed
his twelve months with the “Firm” that Clyndes began
to be affectionately spoken of by theatre-goers. The
actor grew on them, in fact, and was growing more than
ever when Messrs. W. and G. allowed him to go leaving a
visible gap behind him. Managers are not always quick
to hear the vox populi concerning individual artists, nor
apt to understand that a gallery-reception isn’t a safe
thing to swear by.
| JThe Potter-Bellew combination of two did good busi-
ness in Ballarat and Adelaide. Sailing in the Orotava for
India (J. H. Clyndes is on board for London) on Wednes-
day, they were good enough to send us kind regards,
accompanied by aohampagnecorkand somealleged poetry,
which we humbly accept. They have engaged some
Sydney people to support them in “ Hero and Leander”
when they reach London.
Bland Holt’s Company left Melbourne tor Hobart (Tas.)

Walter Bentley, son of Dr. Begg, the great Scotch
disruptionist and Free Church divine, intends to visit
Australia shortly. Walter Begg—a schoolfellow, by the
way, of the present writer—was intended for the Church,
but, visiting New Zealand, adopted the theatrical profes-
sion, and made his debut at the Auckland Prince of
Wales. Since then he has acted as juvenile lead to
Ristori, Henry Irving and Mrs. Bateman, playing with
them such parts as Laertes, Malcolm, Lord Moray, Rob
Roy, &c., and being the Clarence of Irving’s Richard
HI. production, while his Alfred Evelyn, Claude Mel-
notte, Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, Shylock and Romeo, in
a lengthy season with A. M’Neil at the Princess’ of his
native city, Edinburgh, were highly spoken of.
Melbourne musical world is as much disturbed as the
artists were by Gibson’s tinted statue of Venus. Here is
the trouble. At Christmas festival, in the Exhibition,
there is to be an angelic choir singing from the dome,

The Heller Illusion company, with Percy Abbott as

incomes do with their money. If a clergyman with a big
official or private income lives a life of constant self,
sacrifice and dies without money and without debts, no
one can cavil at him. The more money such a man
handles, the better for the poor “ A.E.” : The Caring.
tonian definition of loyalty is all bosh. “ Devotion to the
illustrious lady who so nobly wears the crown ” is at utter
variance with the determination of Australians to fully
govern themselves. No nation can serve two masters....
“Neuter”: The point is not worth discussing. Mr. Alfred
Bennett, in bringing such an action, showed himself to be
quite destitute of journalistic perception, inasmuch as his
expensive and unsuccessful onslaught upon the Star was,
on the face, of it a dunderheaded attempt to lower the
standard of a libel “ Serviceton ” (Vic.): Thanks

on all counts claim th? verdict of the citizens. He, of all
Australian public men up to date, is, we reckon, the only
one whom it is safe to praise during his lifetime.
The Duke of Marlborough, when last
heard of, was making a hog of himself in a New

drown the performance.
Parliament House, Melbourne, is no
longer in black darkness on the front, of a night,

The attempt to give Mr. John Whitton,

The Picturesque Atlas people recently
netted in the Brisbane District Court, under their
cast-iron agreements, a large haul of recalcitrant
subscribers, who vainly put forward all the old
excuses—“lnever signed it,” “It wasn’t delivered

the pricks.
Mr. Bent was a witness in the Premier
Society case the other day, and Dr. Madden
started with the solemn question, “Are you
acquainted with the incident called the land-
boom ? ” Mr. Bent said that he was. As he lost
£750,000, and got involved in an accident, and
broke most of his legs and arms and features
during the boom, he probably recollected it.
An impression is slowly gaining ground
in the United Kingdom that the O’SheaEarnell
case was built upon “faked” evidence from first
to last. The affection which exists between Par-
nell and Mrs. O’Shea is unquestionable, but O’Shea
himself is a notoriously shady character, and more
than one paper now advances the theory that his
wife and Parnell simply let him “ fake ” to his
heart’s content, in order to get rid of the object
which stood between them.

LOTION
Tales of “ The System,”
No, XXIII.—The Platooning of Private
Trench.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
That February day on which E. T. Leppell,
Esquire, M.P. , had expressed (with a giggle) his
desire to witness the execution of a private of
H.M.’s 50th Regiment of Foot,* was drawing to
its close. The summer sun had changed from his
blinding fieriness to a burnished gold, and the
waters of Port Arthur responded to his with-
drawal by softening their amber to a pellucid
purple. Pools of • shadow clung round the Isle des
Morts; one solitary broad beam of crimson which
forced its way through tall sassafras, and taller
blue-gums decorated, ribbon-like, the bosom the
bay ; all else was sapphire or amethyst. The
zenith was veiled with a rosy film, and the clefts
and gullies of the eastern hills were filled with
flakes of vapour. Through the dusking green of
stately English oaks, the tower and pinnacles of
the church glistened with a white purity, and
even the old gaol, conceived though it was in the
best style of Governor Macquarie’s “demon
architect,” took upon its coarse commonplaceness
an unwonted aspect of graceful form and clear
colour. The anchorage contributed its peculiar
element of pioturesqueness to the scene in its tiny
fleet of craft. The Government vessel, the Lady
Franklin, H.M.’s 18-gun sloop, Favourite, and the
brig Tamar—the last flying her Blue Peter—lay
motionless as “painted ships upon a painted
ocean.” Earth and sea and sky wore so exquisite
a tapestry of beauty that even to the narrow
imagination of Mr. Leppell, M.P., the picture
that presented itself to his sight as he stood on
the elevation by Government Cottage, was
heavenly.
“ How very beautiful, to be sure !” he said to
Captain Boote, Settlement Commandant, “ and
how very kind of the Government to grant it to
prisoners when they might, for instance, have
made it a watering-place for the upper classes,,
like —like Brighton and Naples! Really, it’s my
idea of Paradise! I can’t understand anyone
being discontented here. ”
“ Yes, it’s really very pretty,” answered the
Commandant.
“ It only wants one thing to make it —ah, per-
fection !”
“And that is, sir?” Always open to effect
improvement was Captain Boote, and if the ex-
perienced judgment of the House of Commons
man suggested the addition of new and desirable
features to the scene (such as a pretty thing in
treadmills or a chastely-designed flogging-post),
why, Captain Boote would do his best to act upon
it.
“ Oh, music. Just think, Mr. Boote, supposing
this place was not a prison but a fashionable
resort for the upper-classes, how delightful a band
of music would be on such a night as this !” And
Mr. Leppell hummed a tune.
“Ah, yes!” The Captain’s assent was rather
qualified. There was no practical value in that
suggestion. “But you’ll have some music even
now, sir—that is, in a few minutes.”
Even as he spoke, the beat of muffled drum and
the sigh and sob of fifes stole on their ears from
the military cantonment. For Private Trench
had set out on his last march, to the sound of—
music.
# * *
From the battlemented tower a sergeant’s
guard had led the Condemned into the yard of
the military barracks. And there they struck off
his fetters. It was with a hand that shook
violently that the armourer’s mate drove out the
last rivet, for Private Ernest Trench was well-
liked in the regiment in the moments when he
was not very drunk. Then the devil in him used
to work havoc on the faces and the bodies of the
rank and file, and they did not love him quite so
well.
The men of the detachment —some seventy or
eighty —were gathered in groups waiting for the
“ fall-in ” bugle. Most of the convict-gangs had
been ordered in half-an-hour earlier than usual, sc
that their military watchers could be freed for
funeral duty. - The Civil side of the System on
such an occasion had not the least objection to
obliging the military by sacrificing some labour.
Nevertheless, though the Authorities had thus
done their best to confer eclat on the proceedings,
Private Trench, being in a discontented mood (as
it seemed to his officers), complained that suffi-
cient honour was not being done him. We know,
however, it was merely the cynical humour of the
scamp that made him say to Ensign Chick, who
was supervising the unriveting business :
“I should have had a full battalion at my
funeral if you had sent me to the city, sir, and a
thousand or two of the public. Here I’ve nobody
—only a company.”
“Oh, you’ll have the member of the House of
Commons as a spectator. He’ll make up for a
few companies and the mob,” Ensign Chick
replied.
“Good God! is he coming?” gasped Trench.
“God knows, I’ve done my best to keep him
away !”
“What the deuce do you mean, Trench?”
asked the Ensign’s astonished voice.
“Never mind—you’ll see, sir. But tell me
this, please, Mr. Chick —the member’s dau—the
ladies with him, they won’t come and see me
potted, will they ?”
“No, I should think not; it won’t be a sight
for ladies.”
“ Not if the ladies knew what they’re coming to
see. But it is not unlikely they’ll be asked to
witness a striking spectacle. You know, sir,
everything in this damned hole’s a‘spectacle’—
a spectacle for the gods, sir, to weep over.”
‘ ‘ Look here, Trench, don’t make insolent and
insubordinate remarks within half-an-hour of your
death, else— ”
“ Else what? You’ll report me, and give me a
flogging, as Police-Magistrate Stoneman did to
Convict Glancy—flogged him, and dragged him
from the triangles to the gallows? You’d flog
me, and then shoot me? Jove! I wish you
would ! That would be something for the M.P.
to report ! Come, Chickey—what a sweet little
chickey-mhuckey, he is, isn’t he? —try it on!”
And, leaning forward, he struck his officer with
his steel-locked hands. “There, chiek-a-biddy,
do your damnedst!” _ -
It has to be inferred that Private Ernest
Trench was not about to receive his death-wounds
in what Parson Ford would have called “ a com-
mendable spirit.”
* * *
The “ fall-in ” bugle blared out, followed
by the band-call. The officers went to their
stations. Chick, who was not a bad fellow at
heart, resolved to let the insult pass, and took 1 i i
post. Trench, from where he stood in the centre
of the yard, watched the young officer. “By
Jove, Sergeant, he isn’t going to report that blow, ’>
he said to the non-com. of the guard. “ I’ll have
to do something else .”
By which the Sergeant knew Private Trench
contemplated further devilry.
* # *
The ranks are formed, and now for
the procession. Presently the drummers and the
filers move to the head and the officers fall back
to the rear ; and now a half-company follows the
band, and another half-company is stationed just
in front of the officers. And there is a gap between
the two half-companies, and this is filled- —how ?
A hideous black thing moves forward, with an
erratic, centipede-like motion. It is Private
Trench’s coffin carried by six men. That fills
part of the gap.
Private Trench himself moves forward —smiling.
He fills something more of the gap—he, the hero
of the Occasion, takes up the least portion of room.
Much less than his coffin.
And then a section of twelve men interpose
themselves between the Condemned and the
second half-company. But before they do so they
receive and obey a command—reverse arms. They
alone reverse arms of the whole detachment. They
are the executioners.
And to the tap of drum and the whistle of the
fifes, the procession marches off in the slowest
time.
It moves into the lane from the barracks. As
he turns the gate-post Private Trench looks up to
the semaphore by Government cottage. As he
gazed, the ball, which signals to the chain-gang
to suspend labour, runs up to the peak.
“Bill,” Trench calls over his shoulder to the
soldier nearest to him in the firing-party—“ Bill,
it’s knock-off time for me. Hey-ho! What a
blessed sleep I’ll have to-night, and no reveille
and no morning gun ! Don’t you wish you were
me, Bill, lad ?”
» * #
Past the warders’ cottages with the white
palisades, past the Chaplain’s house with the
hawthorn hedge, past the Pier-road, went the
procession. And wondering-eyed children peeped
from verandahs and through fences, and damp-
A TIMELY RESCUE.
P OLICEMAN: “Throw yez a rope, is it? Well, then, begorra, here yez are!”
eyed women—one with a dancing baby in her
arms—crowded to catch a last glimpse of Private
Trench. For when he was sober, Erny Trench
was a favourite with the women and the children
of the Settlement. What pay the canteen did not
rob him of nearly always went for a child’s toy.
Past the hospital, with its magnificent pine-tree
clothed in the parasitic fragrance of the clematis;
past the churchyard, with its sentinel oaks —
“ Jack,” said Trench to the private on the oppo-
site side from Bill, “if you’re here in acorn time,
plant one or two over me, there’s a good chap ”
past the church, with its cruciform walls which
symbolised the Cross and satirised the System, to
the grassy square where the gibbet stood in
ancient Port Arthur days ; past the town to the
place of execution went the procession. And the
drums rolled, and the fifes wailed in the “Dead
March ” all the way.
Facing the wall which separated the square
from the garden of Government Cottage, the pro-
cession was halted.
Half-a-dozen words of command and as many
manoeuvres and then this is the disposition :
Under the wall, with its head a few feet from
the stones, the coffin.
Facing inwards, forming three sides of a square,
their fewness of number necessitating extended
order, the half-companies.
Ten paces from the line of men which confronts
the grim composure of the stone wall, the section
of executioners in double rank of six files.
To the right of the section, a group of officers,
and to its left, the drums and fifes, which beat
and sighed no longer.
And, in the centre of the square, the solitary
figure of Private Trench.
They (the officers) are apparently waiting for
some one.
“I thought,” growled the Captain Command-
ing, “that that Parliament man wanted to see
the show. I’ll give him three minutes’ grace.”
“ What’s that ?” said Dr. Slipshott, who, though
on the Civil side, had joined the group, as he was
acting as locum tenons for the military surgeon.
“That man, Leppell! He must not see the execu-
tion—there’ll be scandal otherwise.”
“What do you mean, sir,” sharply demanded
Captain Jourdain. “ There’s no scandal attached
to our administrative actions —we leave the
scandalous things to the Civil Establishment, ’
“Never mind what I mean, now, Jourdain
Don’t let us quarrel, for God’s sake! I meant
no harm —the scandal’ll be personal to the M.P.
He must not see Trench shot, or after, either.”
“ I fear no M.P.’s report,” persisted the military
man, still misunderstanding Slipshott’s meaning.
“J do everything decently and in order, and to
show you I don’t fear him or any other person, I
sha’n’t give the word till he does come, if I have
to send for him.”
“Well, if you must have my reason,” said
Slipshott, lowering his voice, “ take it! In con-
fidence, mind, for there’s a woman in the question.
All the Regiment believe Trench to be a ‘ swell ?’ ”
“ Yes ! ” broke in Jourdain and Chick.
“ Trench teas a ‘ swell.’ His real name’s Ernest
Trench Leppell—same.as this Parliament fellow’s
who is his uncle. Now do you understand ! ”
“Oh, the devil!” cried Jourdain. “Get it
over. Here, Provost-Marshal, the sentence! —
quick, man, quick ! Chick, see to the prisoner.”
* * *
Even now the scandal might have been
averted but for the appearance of the chain-gang.
The Provost-Marshal began hurriedly to declare
the finding of the Court :
“ That having most maturely, deliberately and very
attentively weighed and considered the whole of the
evidence and matter adduced in support of the prosecu-
tion together with what the prisoner has offered in his
defence, the Court is of opinion that the said Ernest
Trench is guilty of the crime laid to his charge which,
being in breach of the Articles of War, they therefore dp
sentence him, Private Ernest Trench, of the 50th Regi-
ment, to be shot to death at such time and place as ”
Thus far had the Provost-Marshal read when the
clank and draggle of irons, the laborious breath-
ing of overburdened men, and the squash of sqd-
dened boots, drowned his voice; The chain-
gang, returning “home” from their work in the
dock-yard, where they had spent the day in water
up to their necks, as was their custom, rested for
a moment on the rise by Gibbet Square ; and now
they stood, expressing their interest in the un-
wonted scene, by an excited jangling of chains.
The Provost-Marshal stopped at the clashing
tumult. He did not think his voice could over-
bear the maddening monotone of the chains. But
the noise sank more quickly than it arose. They
wished to hear, as well as others, did the chain-
gang.
“ Proceed, sir,” shouted Jourdain, stamping his
foot. “ What are you stopping for ? ” ■
But he was too late. Mr. Ernest Trench Lep-
pell, M.P., had arrived.
His own voice announced his arrival.
As he turned, in company with Commandant
Boote from the latter’s garden, his eyes had
caught the shameful spectacle of the chain-gang.
Fifty-odd wretches bound by twos to one long
cable, in muddy ,yellow-and-black, with fetters
and waist-chains, with “P.A.” and “Felon”
stamped so conspicuously on their clothing that
the, letters were distinguishable under the casing
of thin mud, might appal the sight of a man of
less refinement than a Tory member of Parlia-
ment. Add to the general dreadfulness of their
appearance the villainy indelibly printed on the
majority of faces, the gorilla-jowls, the soaked
garments, and the gluttonous hunger for excite-
ment which the military demonstration called into
their eyes, and it was no wonder that, in his
shocked surprise, Mr. Leppell made an exclama-
tion which reached nearly all ears and attracted
most eyes towards him.
“Great Heavens, Boote ! You don’t mean to
say these are men !”
If Boote answered, no one caught his reply.
For, from beneath the wall, from a spot which
lay flushed with the brilliant gleams of the fast-
fading sun, someone shouted the response: “As
much a man as you are, slave-driver Leppell!”
# * *
Private Trench, on his arrival at the
ground, had looked around, and not seeing his
uncle Leppell, had concluded that “the old
scoundrel ” would not be present, after all. And,
thus thinking, he thought he might as well die
quietly. There was no particular reason, he re-
flected, why he should kick up a fuss so long as his
relative was not present.
So, when Ensign Chick, at Captain Jourdain’s
order, moved forward with a couple of men, a
corporal and a ranker, and commanded Private
Trench to take up his position on his coffin, the
the Condemned obeyed.
“ I’m sorry I insulted you, sir,” he said to the
officer as they went towards the wall. “ The devil
was in me at what you said about—that Parlia-
ment man. I hate —Parliament, you know, sir.
It passed the Mutiny Act.” He laughed, and
Ensign Chick, now understanding, confusedly
said: “Oh, all right, Trench, say no more, but,
look y’ here —I know —well, I’m told you were—
once one of us—Halt I — Right-about face —I mean
—hadn’t you better think of — above, y’ know. On
your coffin, kneel I ”
“Above? God? Heaven? Bah? What I
think of is Hell! ”
Then they listened to the Provost-Marshal.
Whispered Chick : “ The handkerchief. Cor-
poral.' I '' And the Corporal was about to bandage
the eyes of the Condemned when Mr. Leppell’s
voice was heard in his strange, startled exclama-
tion.
“God ! That’s my uncle! ” the soldiers by the
coffin heard the Condemned say. “As much a
man as you are, Slavedriver Leppell! ” And every
man in Gibbet-square heard that last sentence and
saw the action which followed it.
As he uttered the words Trench sprang up
from the coffin-lid and wrenched himself from the
hold of the private. Then he rushed and leapt
across the space which separated him from his
kinsman. Between the intake of a deep breath
and its expiration he had covered the separating
distance, and though his wrists were gripped by the
sheeny steel-clips his hands went round the
honourable member’s throat.
# * *
It was but for a moment that the clutch
lasted, and yet the thumbs seemed to have done
their work on the windpipe. Leppell the uncle
gave one horrid gurgle—“ O God, Erny !” —before
his eyes protruded, and his face-flesh turned
ghastly. But a dozen hands tore Private Trench,
otherwise Leppell the nephew, away in time.
They would have hauled him back to his coffin.
But he said he would walk quietly. He’d done
all he wanted.
“You know, doctor,” he said to Surgeon Slip-
shott, “I’d rather this had not happened. But
there’s a Fate in it. He came out for some amuse-
ment and he’s got it.”
To Captain Jourdain he apologised for inter-
rupting the proceedings. “Sorry, sir, but that
man’s my uncle, and, of course, I was obliged
to pay my loving respects to him. ”
He stood upon his coffin before kneeling down
and gave a glance around.
The group by the prostrate form in the angle of
the square was separating and Dr. Slipshott was
dragging Leppell, M.P., to his feet.
“ Know why I called that man a slave-driver?”
the Condemned asked the Corporal holding the
bandage. “He’s a colliery-owner—works chil-
dren of six and seven years old in chains and iron
girdles—one of his boys, seven years old, had a,
strip of calloused flesh, five inches wide, on his
stomach. Great man, that man ! Defender of
British liberties, English gentleman, and so
forth. He’ll go home, and write a book—’ll say
Penal System admirable—military contented —
see if he doesn’t. But he won’t say he saw his
nephew shot!”
All this he said while the Provost-Marshal
droned out the rest of the sentence and its
approval by the Colonel-Commanding in Yan
Dieman’s Land.
And the Provost-Marshal, Ensign Chick fol-
lowed with his contribution to the rites.
“ Prisoner, on your coffin — kneel /”
“ Section, with ball cartridge—load.”
As the men bit their cartridges, Private Trench
knelt on the coffin-lid.
As they rammed home, and the Corporal, with
tremulous fingers, knotted the handkerchief over
the brilliant eyes, Private Trench said to the non-
com.: “That brig’s flying her Blue Peter —I’m
going out with her. And when I’m gone— ”
But Ensign Chick had ordered the front rank
to the “Present,” and the Corporal, pressing »
last nervous farewell on the doomed man’s
shoulder, had paced to the right, clear of the
bullets’ path.
# * *
There Avas a scuffle in the corner as the
front-rankers volleyed. Boote and Slipshott were
endeavouring to remove Leppell, M.P., from the
ground. But his white face glared oyer his
shoulder, and he saw his nephew spring up
madly, and fall, face downwards.
Whether it was due to the fading light, or to
prior excitement, the men, save one, had missed,
and the one bullet which had found a billet had
left every mortal part untouched. Private Trench
flung out his hands, stirred convulsively, tried to
raise himself, fell back, but breathed. Ensign
Chick’s further intervention was necessary.
“Front rank, left face, quick march. Rear
rank, quick march —forward.”
“ Halt—present — depress muskets .”
“For God’s sake, sir,” cried Private Trench,
“not in the back, sir—wounds in front, sir.”
“ Corporal,” was Ensign Chick’s strident utter-
ance, “ turn him over.”
“Corporal—when I’m gone—my ’kerchief—my
blood —give Slipshott for Miss—he knows.”
The rear-rank, with depressed muskets, fired.
And Private Trench lay supine, with his wounds
in front.

“De Leon’s Reminiscences,” a new book,
by an ex-American Consul-General, gives us a
fresh trifle about Thackeray, who told De Leon
that both he and Dickens were written out, pro-
ducing more dross than ore. Thackeray said he
was spinning out “ Philip ” because he wanted to
put a storey on his house at South Kensington.
The present Marquis of Ailesbury, the
sparkling youth who married Dolly Tester, the
high-kicker, ordered for his house a supply of
hand - grenades for- extinguishing fires. After
all the rooms were supplied there were six grenades

asked the servant. “Better put them in my
coffin,” replied the Marquis.
A letter from the late Canon Liddon is
going the rounds of the press in which he
repudiates the allegation that once when preach-
ing before Mrs. Guelph in the Royal chapel he
imitated Bossuet and remarked, “ And you,
madame, must also die.” We should hope not,
indeed, and if Bossuet actually did use the words,
what an unmitigated snob he must have been !
A London literary paper had a glowing
notice of Princess Beatrice’s new book “ Memoirs
of Count Albert Erhbach,”or something like that,
but Labouchere cruelly applied a douche of cold
water, proper Aqua Pumpaginis, and “put on the
Maginnis,” by showing that the book hasn’t (or
hadn’t) come out yet! A beautiful sample of the
Koo-too. Sir Theodore Martin obligingly revises
Beatrice’s MSS.
Many years ago Jimmy Tyson, the mil-
lionaire, was employed by E. Morey, late P.M.,
at Townsville (Q.), at the rate of £1 a week and
rations. Morey was then a Downs’ squatter,
one of those who “came kerflop ” in the crisis of
the fifties. A few years since Tyson met his old
employer in Flinders-street (Townsville), and after
regarding him gravely for some seconds, solemnly
remarked: “Times is changed, Morey!” The
proposition was absolutely unchallengeable.
The Age lately said : “ The mere fact that
the Prince of Wales is not boycotted from public-
life in so moral a community as that of England
shows, of course, that his career has been abso-
lutely stainless, and we are entitled to hope that
his sons will grow up as admirable.” The fact
that about one person out of seventy will read the
foregoing seriously, sufficiently shows what the
public think of the Prince of Wales, who comes
of an historically immoral race, and has been the
constant companion of a most brilliantly immoral
set of rascals.
Mr. Edward Bulwer Lyttou Dickens (son
of the novelist), who is a N.S. Wales M.P., thus
lately discoursed on certain bribery charges :
He knew as much of Broken Hill as any member in the
House, and had there been any attempt at bribery it was
more than probable that he would have been approached
in the matter.
Which goes to prove that humour is not always
hereditary, and reminds us of the N.S.W. mejnber
of Parliament who, wishing to show how virtuous
he remained amid corrupt surroundings, ex-
claimed ; “ I assure you, Mr. Speaker I had not
been in the House six weeks before I had a hun-
dred bribes offered me.” And everybody appeared
to believe him.

POLITICAL POINTS
Griffith’s Northern tour is regarded in
N.Q. as a cautious crusade against Separation.
In Queensland 18,000,000 acres of Crown
lands have been, or are in process of being,
alienated.
When an attorney, who is an M.P., takes
a fee to see a private Bill through Parliament, he
should, as a matter of decency, be only permitted
to address the House from behind the bar.
The Australian Press almost unanimously,
in the present crisis, jumps on Parnell and
“ downs ” Home Rule. The exceptions will serve
to show the patriotic Irishman where his friends
are.
Judging from recent events, including the
cowardly throwing of lime into the eyes of Parnell,
the present Kilkenny election is being held in
order that the fable of the Kilkenny cats may
develope into a solid actuality.
The impression is that Speight has a card
up his sleeve, in case he should not agree with the
Victorian Government, and this is to form a
syndicate to take over the railways. Victoria, if
capable of considering such a proposal for a single
instant, must indeed have degenerated under the
Coalition.
Political influence has been banished'from
Victorian State railway management, but not
from the construction, so that the country is
logged up with a lot of political lines, run at a
loss. In one point, Speight is like Mirams-he
would have pulled through all right had the Boom
only held on.
Judge Harding, of Queensland, who has
just returned from ’Ome, observes that English
loyalty is much cooler now upon the appearance
of the Queen in public than he remembers it five
and-twenty years ago. Yes, Queen-worship is dying
by inches, and is doomed to become as extinct as
are the sacred cats of ancient Egypt.
Since his last expulsion, A. G. Taylor has
taken his seat in the N.S.W. Assembly on fully
two occasions, and Mr. Speaker looks like a man
who feels duly thankful. Probably both remember
the story of the much-married editor, who began
an article, “ How to make home happy,” and
whose wife wrote underneath, “Keep away from
it.”
“ The Times says that “the violent scene
at the recent meeting of the Irish party has justi-
fied the most sinister predictions as to what would
be the result of the establishment of an Irish
Legislature.” In other words, the Times is quite
sure that that the English are the only nation on
earth who are fit to govern either themselves or
other people.
Suppose a woman came forward and com-
plained to the law of an assault which had been
made upon her virtue six months before. Suppose
that at and since the time of the alleged assault
she had admittedly made no noise and no com-
plaint, what would now be thought of her story ?
Applying this supposition to N.S.W. politics,
what is the inevitable deduction?
To listen to the howling of the dingoes
one would think that 0. S. Parnell was the first
man who had got a little out of his course owing
to the allurements of woman, whereas history
proves that the Irish “ gentry ” to a man have
been notorious in all times for their promiscuous
and reckless attachments to women. The Lord
Leitrims, &c., however, did not agitate for free-
dom.
When a man gets sacked from Sydney
G.P.O, for drunkenness or theft, the Postmaster-
Gineral is not too hard on him, but very often
takes him back in a temporary position. In other
words, Minister O’Connor shows mild symptoms of
turning the N.S.W. Post-office into a reformatory
and inebriate-asylum. Up to date we notice that
the men who have been allowed to reform have had
plenty of political influence.
Can anything more forcibly illustrate the
need of social re-organisation than the fact, as
demonstrated by Government Statistician Hayter,
that out of a gross population of 854,434 souls in
Victoria (Anno 1881), no less than 280,957 persons
were engaged in domestic duties, i.e., non-produc-
tive and positively abject dependent occupations ?
This proportion equals 32'36 per cent of the total
community. What a state of civilisation !
Michael Davitt, writes The Bulletin’s
London correspondent, has made a hit with his
Labour World, though Heaven knows why, see-
ing that it is merely a second-rate Reynolds’ with
endless Irish hash, of which everybody is sick to
death. The Liberals are winning all the bye-
elections through the rank-and-file Unionists
“ coming on, ” and there’s not a shadow of doubt
that the elections will come soon—probably in the
spring.
Crick now asserts that when he made his
charges of corruption against Speaker Abbott and
Chairman {Melville he was mad-drunk. He also
claims that he resigned and was not expelled.
Now, as the corruption charges and the tendering
of his resignation were almost simultaneous, it
becomes plain that if he was not responsible for
the charges, neither was he responsible for his
resignation. Ergo , he did not resign but was
expelled. Q.E.D.
Subject for great historical picture; Mr,
Henry Hassall, M.P., selling at 12s. fid. a share a
thousand shares which he had bought at 17s. fid.
each, and thus losing £2so—all “in order that he
might stand in a thoroughly independent position
on the floor of the House. ” If Mr. Hassall knew
—and surely he must have known when buying—
that the Broken-hill Water Bill was to come
before Parliament, and that it was his duty to
vote on it, why did he voluntarily place himself in
an interested position by acquiring an interest in
the scheme ?

We read that “there is considerable
speculation as to what part Lord Carington will
play in England—whether he will make an effort
in political life, or become again ‘ one of the Marl-
barough House set.’ ” Lord Carington will, The
Bulletin predicts, simply do that which is com-
mended to him by his glorified-stable-boy intellect
as the downiest thing to do.
# # *
Ex-Governor Carington has assisted at the
installation of that poor creature, Prince Albert
Victor of Wales, as Grand Master of the Berk-
shire Freemasons, on which occasion he remarked
that “the Freemasons of Australia will continue
loyal eternally. ” Eternity is a long time. Caring-
ton should have confined himself to remarking
that Australian Masonry might continue to
tolerate the Guelph brood so long as it hadn’t to
pay anything for supporting that miserable race
of epileptic nonentities—always provided that the
Guelphs aforesaid were not too obtrusively forced
upon its attention.
* * *
Mr. Midas Burdekin has been re-elected
Mayor of Sydney. In view of the disastrous
financial experiences of more than one open-
handed municipal magnate, no one else is “ game
for the Mayoralty while there looms ahead the
expensive prospect of having to civically instal
Governor Jersey. It is understood that Mr.
Burdekin will shortly depart on a visit to Europe,
and that he has a hazy idea of colliding with a
baronetcy or something during his absence from
the city in which he weekly reaps so rich a crop of
rents. Which reminds us that John Thomas
Smith, who was seven times Mayor of Melbourne,
was deputed during one of his terms of office to
present an address of congratulation to Queen
Victoria on the marriage of the Princess Royal;
and although he went to England with a private
secretary, and a chaplain, and had the honour of
kissing Her Majesty’s little finger, he returned
without a title, and accompanied only by the
secretary and chaplain aforesaid and a donkey,
the first quadruped of its kind imported to this
favoured land. It would be interesting to learn
what has become of this historic animal, which,
if still alive, should be conducted around all the
Australian public schools at the end of a string,
in company with the Soudan donkey, as a solemn
warning to the rising generation of the folly of
wasting your substance in a chase after false
glory.

A titled aristocrat bearing the name of
Galloway, is shortly expected as a guest at Go-
vernment House, Sydney. Apparently there is
an impression abroad that Galloway’s reputation
has been eaten away a good deal, for an English
paper apologises for him as follows ;
Lord Galloway has had the bad luck to fall into one or
two adventures of a very questionable kind, entirely
owing to the folly or mendacity of the other participators.
This is a case that, like Parson Gardiner’s, evi-
dently requires Christian sympathy, and The
Bulletin gets up on its hind legs to pray that a
great anathema may descend like tons of boiling
lead on these “other participators.” Compassion
would be thrown away on the crowd who led a
simple British peer astray, and annihilation is too
light a punishment. We want to see them live to
be old and toothless, gumming tough steak in a
cheap restaurant, where they slop the gravy on
the floor and keep a loose-jointed waiter who falls
down with the meat, and where there is always a
fly in the soup and a long hair in the butter. We
have read all about Lord Galloway. We don’t
want him in Australia. He is too unlucky.

Extraordinary announcement from the
N.Z. daily press
The Mayors of Christchurch, Dunedin, Auckland, and
Wellington have intimated to the N.Z. Premier their
approval of the suggestion that the Queen should be
asked to become godmother to Lord Onslow’s son.
Another suggestion on the subject, on which much stress
is laid, is the bestowal of a Maori name on the child.
Steward, please open the port-hole.
# # *
The Earl of Onslow’s Maoriland-born in-
fant son has been christened “Taihoa”—collo-
quially, in Maori, “Wait a Bit” —the idea being
to approximately render in Maori the name
“ Onslow.” This, we presume, is another link in
those silken bonds which, &c., &o.
The country would be glad to know
Parkes’ private opinion on the Parnell divorce-
case, if the old man would kindly oblige.

Gem from N.S.W. provincial paper :
To the Editor Inveeell Times.
Sir, —We had a bit of a school treat a few days ago at
Little Plain ; and in course of talk one of my neighbours
said plants, trees, and so on, were male and female. That
was too much of a good thing for me, I can tell you. I
have set under clergy of all colours, college men too, but
none of them ever went so far as that. I think these new
fangled ideas do no good to the growing youngsters ; it
puts bad in their heads. And he was an old gray-headed
man that said it; but I put him in a corner by asking
him to show me a male grain of wheat from a female
e-rain. Will vou please tell me if it is true ’—Yours, &c.,
JOHN SLOOOME.
The poor schoolmaster runs against some big snags
in his time.

A man accused of a heinous offence at the
recent Sydney Criminal Sittings was discharged
after two trials, the jury on both occasions dis-
agreeing. On leaving the dock, the prisoner, who
had theretofore borne an unblemished character,
called God to witness his innocence, when Judge
Foster just as solemnly said he did not believe
him ! Perhaps so, but then Judge Foster said Mrs.
Louisa Collins’ case was one in whiohajury “might
reasonably disagree,” and yet, without a further
scrap of evidence being adduced, Mrs. Collins
was, as the result of another trial, handed over to
the hangman !

Albury hospital appears to be in a state of
squalor consequent on internal drunkenness. The
story is one of undispensed prescriptions, dirty
surgical instruments, and boozy officials. Several
witnesses deposed that the superintendent was
drunken and neglectful. The superintendent
himself alleged drunkenness against the matron ;
the cook said the superintendent was often drunk
and the matron sometimes so drunk that she
had to be put to bed. The night-nurse said
she had often seen the superintendent drunk, but
the matron “ only took a glass of ale which occa-
sionally went to her head slightly.” Eor which
sweet, merciful, musical, womanly phrase, The
Bulletin hereby returns its best thanks to the
night nurse.
* * *
Brisbane press is run purely in the
interests of the church, and ex-parsons collar all
the positions worth holding. The atmos-
phere of the Courier is Baptist; that of
the. Telegraph, Wesleyan ; and that of the
Australian, Roman Catholic. Rev. W. Roberts
does the bulk of the supplementary leader-writing
for the Courier, to the entire exclusion of the
professional scribes ; the ex-revs. Brentnall and
Woolnough do similar service for the Telegraph ;
while Father Fouhy and his priestly satellites
completely dominate the Australian. Another
“daily” is thus the daily prayer of the contri-
buting pressmen of the Northern city.
# * *
“Special Constable W.,” in a pathetic
appeal to the S.M. Herald, expresses the hope
that the N.S.W. special-constables will at least
be permitted to retain their batons as a memento
of the interesting epoch when they stood between
menacing unionism and cowardly “free” labour.
He further suggests that said batons may be
“handed down to generations to come,” and also
discloses the fact that he himself springs from a
race of heroes, his father having acted as “special ”
during the Chartist riots ! The Bulletin is
afraid “W.” gives a false initial. It has never
before seen Iscariot spelt with a “ W.”
# * *
A stewardess, who signs herself a “Victim
of the Strike,” tells a sad tale in a Sydney daily.
“ Many of my class,” she says, “who beforethe
strike lived entirely on board their vessels have, since
the strike, had to seek homes in boarding-houses.”
Daily she has called at the different shipping-
offices, but always to receive the same answer,
“No vacancy”—and this while her board-bill is
mounting daily and the landlady’s mouth is set-
tling down at the corners. Finally—
Last Thursday, after going to the different offices and
not obtaining a situation, I applied to a certain firm for
needlework and gained employment and worked from
Thursday till Saturday, making 180 buttonholes and sewed
on 78 pieces of tape, besides other trifles. I received the
large sum of 2s. 3d. for my work. Therefore it is not
possible to earn a living at needlework. I certainly think
that there should be a fund raised to assist us in sad
hours of need until we get employment at sea again.
The Bulletin sincerely sympathises with this
reduced stewardess, both in her inability to obtain
work at her accustomed occupation, and in her
change from cabin-table fare to boarding-house
provisions. But, as work is urgently wanted,
what is the mattqr with domestic service ? There
can be no pity for any able-bodied woman (and all
the stewardesses we have met have been particu-
larly able-bodied) who elects to work buttonhole
for her living while she can get at least 15s. a
week and board and every night out and a good
deal more in service, if she has the stuff of which
able-bodied ladies are ordinarily constructed. Nor
can there be any pity for any able-bodied woman
who openly says that she wants to loaf on a
“fund” until she can “go to sea again.”

The Ladies Dorothea and Estelle Hope,
sisters of the Earl of Hopetoun, have, as the
world knows, arrived at Melbourne on a visit to
their brother. The spectacle presented by the fair
pair mounted on donkeys at Port Said would not
have greatly impressed thejeunessedoreeoi Toorak.
Lord Hopetoun’s amiable sisters are remarkable
for their slim, not to say scraggy, figures. Each has
a lot of straw-coloured hair overhanging a pair of
apparently short-sighted pale-blue eyes, and a pale,

A distinguished surgeon who supports the

mind you, not 125 years—be still allowed to
pursue their occupations. The grateful “quacks”

In reporting the libel-case, Bennett v.
Star, the latter paper quoted “ Ananias and
Sapphira” as “Annanias and Sophia.” The
E. News, by the way, used constantly to spell
“Ananias” with a double “n.” Great are the
complexities of the English language. If Ananias
has but one “n,”why should not “Bennett” be
spelt simply “Benet?” It would save a lot of

The first patient experimented on with
Koch’s consumption cure is dead, and several
others have since followed him. Possibly lie is
the exception that proves the rule, but when the
rule begins with an exception it excites unpleasant

the only cure for consumption is a funeral, and the
funeral, unfortunately, is incurable.

Almost the only N.S.W. official who, after
having his name set down upon the Estimates for
an increase of salary, has been denied the advance
by Parliament, is the Sydney City Coroner. The
fact that Mr. Woore, a very old member of the
Civil Service, has made some mistakes since his
translation to town, in no way justifies the brutal
and cowardly attacks made on his personal
appearance under cover of privilege. However,
one thing is tolerably certain: It is hardly possible
to make a first-class coroner out of anything but
a hard-headed medical man.

The Koek-Koek show of brand - new

former is lusciously painted, the latter large and
taking. Venus has her clothes all off, Juno and
Minerva are slipping them on in disgust. Not a
picture of brilliant genius, but thoroughly work-
manlike. Who is to buy it? No public gallery—
but we forgot, Dale Chloe still refuses to blush in

This hideous Johnston tragedy at Ballarat,
in which a mad broker slays his four pretty
children and mortally injures his wife, brings to
mind two most piteous affairs in Melbourne - most
piteous because the hand of Nemesis was in no
way traceable in them. In Walsh-street, South
Yarra, a few years ago, a rich man’s luxurious
two-storied wooden house was burnt to the
ground, with all his children (four) in it, his wife
being dragged out insensible ; the father was away
on business up country. In North Melbourne, a
man and his wife locked up their wooden cottage,
leaving their three children asleep in bed, and
went off to see a funny play at the theatre, but on
their return the house was burnt, and all the
children too. The one bright feature of the
Johnston horror is that the wife, after lingering
awhile, died, instead of living only to realise-that
all her children had been slaughtered by the
maniac her husband.

A Cooktown (Q.) fair one entered a Chinese

“WELLY LI !”
Editor Bulletin. Sir, I read your
article on “ Stuffing ” with much interest, as from
what I know of Chinese cooks the less we have to
do with them the better. I have heard much
criticism on the subject; some averring that
“Stuffing” was merely founded on the writer’s
fancy. However, “The Bunyip’s ” experience
happens to tally with my own, and if what I now
write should be the means of deterring even one
person from retaining the services of a Chinese
cook, I shall feel rewarded. Some years ago my
husband and I were staying at one of the best
hotels in Brisbane. We had then just been
married, and as my husband was rather a gourmet
I took particular note of the dishes he most pre-
ferred, with a view to the time when we should settle
down in our new home. My husband particularly
praised the hotel pastry, which certainly was very
light and flaky, and in the after-time I never
could quite succeed in pleasing him in that direc-
tion; for however much I excelled myself, he
always wound up by remarking, “My dear, I
wish you could make pastry like that cook at the
Tip Top”!! It was most exasperating to find
myself compared unfavourably with a Chinaman ;
and when next he visited Brisbane we went, as
before, to the Tip Top, whose landlady, after some
demur, gave me an introduction to Ah Man, the
cook. Insinuatingly holding a half-sovereign ’twixt
The State-school refreshment hour. Chewing-gum, one halfpenny a stick.
finger and thumb, I politely asked the yellow man
a few leading questions. “ Did he use baking-
powder or anything like that ?’’ “No ; only flour,
suet, water, white of egg.” “ Did he mix it in a
particular fashion?” “No; allee same way.”
And that was all I could extract for my half-
sovereign. While on the hotel roof one afternoon,
armed with a strong pair of opera-glasses, I by
accident discovered that I could see right down
into the kitchen —a wooden erection to the rear of
the main building, lighted by a large skylight,
now, to my joy, wide open. Looking through the
gap, I could see the cook rolling out a mass of
dough on the table. Then I could see him beat
up the white of an egg or two and put it in the
cup on the table beside him. Here was the crux
of the position, and I nearly let fall the opera-
glasses in my trembling anxiety. He then took a
sip of the contents of the cup, and—oh, horror !
spat it through his broken, blackened teeth all
over the rolled-out mass of dough. I wonder if
that was what made his pastry so “ welly li’?” —
C. Bun.

A number of Melbourne ladies—mostly
married, by the way—have lately taken to heaving
their idolatry at a certain comic-opera singer, who
is alleged to regard his worshippers with a look of
horror similar to that which Joseph wore when
Mrs. Potiphar was shrieking her soft nothings
after the young Jewish gentleman’s retreating
form. The englamoured females, rendered de-
sperate by the chortler’s icy glare, have given
bold advertisement to their devotion by throwing
flowers across his stage track, and pelting him with
lace-edged fans and smelling-bottles, and things,
all of which the unresponding cherub tramples
under his flat feet or contemptuously kicks into the
orchestra for fiddlers to scoff at. Occasionally, so
rumour says, a disgusted husband swoops down
upon his lawful lump of disappointed loveliness
and packs it off to Europe by the next
boat, Europe being the place where we
send our impressionable matrons in exchange
for the male parties who mash ’em. Any w r ay, it
is evident that the tuneful Joseph heretofore
referred to has been an unwilling cause of much
tender idiocy and social disquietude. And as
woman’s love is too beautiful a thing to lie
wasted on the desert air, and no daughter of Eve
should stand in want of a warning voice when
she feels anxious to make an object of
herself, The Bulletin now takes oath and
testifies that this worship of Joseph is founded
upon a general misunderstanding of the real facts
of the case. In the first place, he isn’t half
enchanting enough to die for, either as an artist or
as an ordinary everyday sort of human being.
He lacks the all-important qualification of a
wicked eye, and appears to be quite hopelessly
respectable. Joseph, in fact, is just a pleasant,
wholesome, good-tempered looking fellow, owning
one wife and a liberal allowance of children. He
has done absolutely nothing to justify his sudden
elevation to the pinnacle of perfection, and he
doesn’t like the pinnacle now he is perched upon
it. Therefore, we exhort the maidens of Mel-
bourne to set their minds upon something tangible,
and beseech the demented wives and mothers to
rest content with their faithful Potiphars, who
might, in many instances, look quite equal to the
other fellow if they were limelit and faked up.

“The Queen was much distressed when

Gaslight robbery goes on here, there and

Lovely woman is evidently supposed to
take her Xmas literature sadly. Of three short
stories in the Lady’s Pictorial, the first leaves
the heroine with her head upon the breast of her
dead second lover, who had murdered her first
lover; the next finishes with the heroine looking
out of the window for the gallant boy who threw
himself upon some quicksands to drown; and the
third maudlin narrative reaches a climax in the
heroine’s watery grave. All seems to be cold,
blank misery, with the exception of a few
millinery advertisements.

Russell Sage is quoted as saying : “ I never

a situation who didn’t turn out to be as mean as
he could. I now let other men run the philan-
thropy business. ”
It was stated, the other day, at a meeting
of the Melbourne Evening Standard share-
holders, that the employes voluntarily submitted
to a reduction in their wages of 10 per cent, rather
than see the size of the paper reduced. This
absurd eight-page notion is the rock on which so
many journalistic ships have split. The Age won
its spurs and achieved its greatest victories and
politically beat the Argus as a big four-page
paper, and a big four-page outspoken, honest
mornieg sheet, Radical to the back-bone, and run
by another Ebenezer Syme, would make a fortune
either in Melbourne or in Sydney. To make a
daily pay, its size must be proportioned to its
advertisements. A single column of advertise-
ments in a daily paper should (20 inches at 4s. per
inch nett) mean £4 daily or £24 weekly, which is
£1250 a year. Thus, two columns of advts. per
day pay interest on a capital of £50,000 at 5 per
cent. Supposing, however, that a daily has two
columns of advts. less, then it has to provide two
additional columns of matter and type-setting,
which latter item alone means, say, 28s. per day,
£8 Bs. per week, or £420 per annum—the interest
on £B4OO at 5 per cent. In clutching at this false
glory of eight instead of four, fortunes have been
thrown away in spinning out cheap advertisements
on expensive paper.
A Perilous State.
The moment a child is born; that moment he
begins to die. Therefore beware of disease making
inroads into the system. Probably one of the
earliest signs is slight dyspepsia which cannot be
attributed to errors in diet, want of fresh air, &c.
It is a nervous kind of atonic dyspepsia, some-
times combined with acidity from liver sympathy.
There is not the same relish for food, and so relief
from this state is sought for in piquant relishes,
wine, or tea. Another symptom is an uneasy or
tired feeling about the head, fulness it may be, or
sleeplessness and stupidity, especially after eating.
The brow is often hot, so is the top of the head,
and the hand is pressed wearily across the eyes.
Life begins to lose its brightness, then things
begin to go a trifle wrong, and there are moments
of peevishness and irritability. Lowness of spirits
is succeeded by want of sleep. There is danger
ahead, if not, indeed, close at hand, and happy is
he who sees the signal in time. Recourse should
immediately be had to some genuine tonic restora-
tive, which will restore the consumed nervous
tissue, and most probably Clements Tonic is the
best for this purpose, it having had uniformity
good results every time we have seen it used. In
cases of debility, nervous prostration, bilious and
nervous headaches, anaemia and all diseases arising
from poorness of blood and indigestion, Clements
Tonic can be used with confidence. It is not a
quack remedy, and unlike other patent medicines
its proprietors do not claim that it “will cure
everything ” from lock-jaw to bad spelling. But
for cases of affections of the nervous and digestive
systems it is specially serviceable. E. C. Gutt-
ridge, Esq. (Messrs. Mauri Bros.), writes 486
Kent-street, Sydney. Dear Sir,— It is only justice
that I should write to you of the benefit I have
derived from the use of Clements Tonic. Two
years ago I was brought to death’s door by typhoid,
and from that time until recently I was quite
destitute of strength and energy, my daily occu-
pation was severe toil, and I had on several
occasions to take complete rest from business on
account of sheer weakness. Eventually I com-
menced to take Clements Tonic, and with the
first bottle I commenced to regain strength, and
you can readily understand that I continued its
use, and now have taken six large bottles. My
strength is completely restored ! I give all the
credit to Clements Tonic, and having obtained so
much benefit from its use I think the least I can
do is to induce others to use it. W. J. L. Kyle,
Esq., Postmaster, Manilla, N.S.W. writes, July
23rd, 1889. Dear Sir,—At the beginning of the
present winter I suffered for several weeks from
very severe attacks of neuralgia and toothache.
After trying several remedies (?) without any
relief, I heard of a friend who had derived great
benefit from Clements Tonic, and believing that
my system wanted bracing up, I sent for a bottle,
and before I had finished it the neuralgia had
quite left me. At first I was sceptical as to the
merits of Clements Tonic, but am now fully con-
vinced that it does all you claim for it, and you
can send me another bottle, as a stand-by against
all future attacks.

A Melbourne paper lately wrote that
“ the Blessedness of Poverty ” was all humbug,
whereupon Archbishop Carr (R.C.) took up a
lance for Poverty, with an oration to the effect
that it was the very best thing. The paper
returns to the charge with an assertion that Arch-
bishop Carr gets £6000 per annum, and Cardinal
Moran £9000.
Under the title, “A Shepherd and hi 8
Flock,” we read the following in a Broken Hill
paper : —“ t The Rev. A. J. Birt pleaded guilty to a
charge of allowing his goat to stray in public
places. He stated that the goat came into his
yard some time ago. He tried to find the owner,
but could not. As soon as he received the
summons he sold the animal. Defendant was
fined 5s and costs, £2 8s 4d in all.” Which makes
us smile, but we don’t know why.
One of the best things that G. H. Reid has
got off for a long time was said the other night in
tjie N.S.W. Legislative Assembly. Lakeman,
M.L. A., was bemoaning the fact that he could not
get any attention paid to the rabbit-question,
“Why don’t you include female suffrage in a
rabbit-bill ? ” said Reid, looking first at Lakeman
and then at Premier Parkes. “ It would then go
through flying. ”
The Contractors’ Lien Bill has successfully
emerged from its third reading by the Victorian
Lower House, despite the agonising squeals of the
Melbourne Argos and the quondam book-censor
Patterson. The measure was introduced to enable
contractors to consider the buildings which they
had erected at their own expense as their own
property until the proprietor {sic ?) had paid for
them. It will be a decided feather in the cap of
the Labour party should the Bill survive the class
opposition with which it will be met in the Upper
House, as the amount of wages lost to builders’
employes through premeditated insolvencies on
the part of the lords of the soil has been computed
to total no less a sum than £17,600 annually.

The Referee
Mr. “Jack” Want’s endeavour to alter the
method of electing the A.J.D. Committee is a laudable
one, but as it 1s opposed by the Union Club, that settles
the matter. The present mode of electing the A.J.C.
Committee differs altogether from that adopted by all
other known clubs, and is this: The A.J.C. Secretary
sends to e|cji member, wherever located, a ballot-paper
hearing the names of the candidates ; simultaneously the
\\tt\e'inipm%im in imperio which sits on A.J.C. matters
at the Unrori Club-house, Sydney, circularises the mem-
bers asking them to be sure and send down their ballot-
papers as usual to the Union Club, doncherknow, and the
members-of the irnperium aforesaid, who know' what is
the right thing to do, yersee, will save them the trouble
of voting. (The rule of the A.J..C. at present is, that a
member, w'hen voting by post, shall, after striking out on
the ballot-paper the name of the person or persons for
whom he does not intend to vote, sign his name inside
the envelope in which he returns the ballot-paper, other-
wise the vote will be informal.) The plan now adopted by
the country member w-hose delight it is to strengthen
the hands of the A. J.C.’s conservative tow r n-ring is not to
mark the ballot-paper at all, but simply, after writing his
name inside an envelope, in accordance with the regula-
tion aforesaid, to re-post his ballot-paper in a state of
virgin purity to the Union Club irnperium, who, after
they have carefully struck out the names of their enemies,
hand it in to the A.J.C. And thus it happens that at a
general meeting you will find some member of the Union
Club-sailing in with some seventy or eighty signed returned
envelopes, containing ballot-papers, in his hand and
plumping them down en bloc. This is part of the machinery
by which the A.J.C. is made so “ select.” It is likewise a
part of the means by which the A.J.C., as compared with
the V.R.C., is such a dismal failure and so out of touch
with the crowd.

In the championship seulling-match, there is
not much doubt M'Lean had Kemp at his mercy from
start to finish. The alleged foul could in no case have
made any difference to the result of the race. Mr. M’Lean
is now full-fledged champion of the world, and thus is
fulfilled the prediction of E. Hanlan, Esq. Kemp at first
took his gruel badly, saying he would never again row a
race umpired by Mr. Blackman ; that he did not try to
win after the foul, and that he did not consider the win
put M‘Lean in the first rank of scullers. Which may be
quite true, seeing that somehow or other no one ever
seriously regarded Kemp himself as being in the first rank
of scullers.
*# . *
The Spencer Brothers, dentists, of Sydney, are
probably unrivalled in the w r orld in their knowledge of
the science of rigging a man up in a boat. M‘Lean,
according to all accounts, could not have been better
fitted-up in the championship-race if his boat and sculls
had been intended to chew something.
# # #
M‘Lean is as yet devoid of one accomplishment
—the art of oratory. Tub Bulletin cautions him to
abstain from learning. By the time an oarsman has learnt
to spout, he has generally forgotten how' to row.

Does it not seem a strange thing that the old-
timers did not find out that a man had “ a point ” on his
chin? Read Boxiana from the time of Figg to Sayers,
and see how few fair “ knocks-out” were given. Allowing
that the old-timers did not “ try for thepoint"’ sometimes
surely in their hundred-round batterings they got on to
the spot by accident? It looks much as if a blow from a
glove has a more deadening effect than that from the
naked mauley.

The subject of the old bruisers brings to mind
the fact that Joseph Choynski, Esq., of America, now' in

Shades of the old-time gladiators ! Only £l5O for a
meeting with pillows between a man who was beaten in

Drink, and can you make sure you have not made a Mis-

It is related of Midwinter, the recently-deceased
Australian professional cricketer, that in England one day,
after a match, a well-known English amateur, who has
been in Australia, said, “ Carry my bag over to the
station, ‘Mid.,’ and I’ll give you a shilling.” “Mid.”
simply answered, “Carry mine over, Mr. , and I’ll
give you two shillings.” This story has been told before—
of Emmett, the English professional.

The war between the N.S.W. Pony Association
and the Sydney Driving Park Club appears to be nearing
a termination. The Association has removed all dis-

registered courses. It will be interesting to note how
this will affect the Driving Park, which up to now has
been able to hold its own.

George Parr, the famous Notts, cricketer —a

So far, the junior cricketers who have been tried
in their maiden efforts have not shown that pluck for
which Australian cricketers are famous. When they face

they drift back into junior clubs.

The Australian Athletic Club gave the first of
their Saturday evening shows on the 13th inst., but the
public, which loves blood, will not “ catch on ” to mere
“ scientific ” tapping matches, and as a consequence the

between Mr. George Seale and the American, Joe Choyn-
ski. This was Mr. Seale’s first appearance after a very

Lizzie Nelson, a lady of something under Bst.,
is anxious to box any feather-weight angel in Australia
for a£s trophy—Marquis of Queensberry rules. Regular
business in the sweet girl pugilist line is almost a dead
letter, but the writer has an imported maid-of-all-work
who flatly declines to take a week’s wages and go, so if
Lizzie will kindly knock her out as soon as possible she
can take a trophy of the value above stated. Further-
more, Lizzie can stop on under a long engagement if she
will undertake to squelch the dissatisfied milkmaid and
the preposterous butcher, who are continually obtruding
last year’s accounts into the otherwise peaceful routine of
our daily life.

John Roberts made a spot-barred break of 363
lately, and Peall giving Dawson 3000 in 10,000, compiled
3304 the biggest “all in” break on record. As a conse-
quence, during two innings, the Huddersfield man did not
get a chance to take up the cue. Curiously enough,
Peall made a break of 2413 on the same (Nov. 4) four years
ago.
Fight On An Engine.
THE ENGINEER AND FIREMAN GRAPPLE IN A
DEATH STRUGGLE.
A fight to the death between the engineer and
fireman of an express train, speeding through the
country at night, is a bold conception of a modern
novelist.
The fireman is jealous of the engineer. One
night crazed with drink, he heaps on coal fuel
until the boiler is likely to explode. The engineer
pleads with him, then expostulates, and at last
attempts to prevent further addition. Then the
fireman grapples the engineer and tries to throw
him from the engine; a terrible struggle ensues.
The fight is for life ! They speak no. word, but
with teeth clenched, strive one to precipitate the
other to the ground. Meanwhile the train rushes
on. The engineer, finally growing weak, endea-
vours to reach the regulator to stop the train
and summon help. Too late! The crazed fire-
man guesses his plan, stiffens himself to a super-
human effort, lifts the exhausted engineer from
his feet, exclaiming : —“ Ah. you want to stop the
train. Now, out you go.” With this he flung the
engineer out; but the latter clings to him ; he
cannot shake him off; so both go out together.
Drawn under the wheels, they are found headless,
two bloody trunks clinging in a death embrace !
And the train, ungoverned, rushes on in the dark-
ness ! Hei’e the story ends ; the fate of the train
is left to the imagination. It is easy to see that
the chances are a hundred to one it rushes on to
destruction. So with the person having chronic
kidney complaint—it is almost certain to result in
Bright’s disease, then death, for the doctors admit
they have no cure for it. But a certain cure may
be had. Note what Robert Moore, of Horsham,
Victoria, says, under date of 20th August, 1890 1 —
‘"For a number of years I have suffered from
disease of the kidneys, which was gradually
undermining ray health. My urine was diseased,
and contained albumen in such quantities which
proved that I was suffering from the dreaded
Bright’s disease of the kidneys. As the disorder
advanced I became weaker, the knee joints, as
well as the ankles and eyelids, began to swell. I
lost all appetite, and experienced extreme wake-
fulness, nervousness, and finally, burning sen-
sations in the back. My urine was scanty, and
micturation was attended with much pain. When
commencing Warner’s safe cure and safe pills, I
had nearly lost my eyesight, but a dozen bottles
[removed the swelling of the joints and pave me
back my sight. In time the albumen all disap-
peared, and I recovered my health.” Mrs. E.
Payne, of Olive-street, Albury, N.S.W., writes as
follows : —‘ 1 For the past three years I have been
the subject of a most distressing disease of the
kidneys. At first I felt myself getting daily
weaker ; there were no particular pains, but some
twelve months’ since, [fearful pains invaded all
parts of my system. Ultimately dropsy set in,
and my stomach became preternaturally extended
and filled with water, literally bringing me to the
brink of the grave. An analysis of my urine
showed a large percentage of albumen, proving
that I was stricken with the dread Bright's disease.
I commenced the use of Warner’s safe cure, and
after I had taken one full bottle, the kidneys
resumed their action and the dropsy abated. Prior
to taking Warner’s safe cure the water had to be
removed by surgical means. Subsequent analysis
also proved that the albumen was lessening. To
be brief, I may add that I have now used eight or
nine bottles of safe cure, and every trace of this
grave and so called fatal disease has been re-
moved.”
THE GREAT REMEDY FOR PAIN.
ST. JACOBS OIL.
WHAT IT IS.
SIX STANDARD VIRTUES.
Ist. It is in one word a cure ;it is not merely a
relief, and in no sense a cure-all; it is the product
of scientific research.
2nd. It strengthens while it soothes and sub-
dues, heals, and cures ; it literally conquers pain.
3rd. Its effects are curative and permanent to
the vyhole group of muscular miseries and nervous
agonies.
4th. It does not merely irritate the outer
surface, nor does it merely soften or relax a con-
stricted muscle. To its specific action a superior
curative virtue is superadded.
sth. It penetrates deeply but gently; search-
ingly and surely seeking the pain spot in an effort
to conquer.
6th. Each constituent of the formula has a
recognised intrinsic virtue to serve most surely
the cure of pain.
SOME AUSTRALIAN EVIDENCE.
The editor of that favorably known and pro-
gressive periodica], the Illustrated Sydney
News, writes that he “has, much pleasure in
giving the proprietors of St. Jacobs oil his testi-
mony with respect to its wonderful curative
properties. The editor has suffered acutely with
chronic sciatica, and has found the greatest relief
by the application of St. Jacobs oil to the affected
parts, and has no hesitation in recommending it
to sufferers."’
The lady who edits the Band of Mercy
(Sydney), also states that she “can testify to the
value of St. Jacobs oil, as it is used in her family
with great benefit.”
I F YOU WISH

petty ihconveniences of this paradoxical sub-

trains, your temper—if you wish to arrive at your
business premises in the morning disposed to
quarrel with everyone you come in contact with,
and to arrive home of an evening in a fit mood to
abuse your wife, baste the baby, kick the cat, or,
indeed, for the matter of that, to “kick the
bucket,” in a sudden fit of splenic apoplexy, why.
buy one of those cheap, trashy, made-up-to-gull

RELIABLE TIMEKEEPER,
A true and trusty friend and faithful companion
—if you wish a timekeeper which myriads of
grateful purchasers have satisfied themselves is
fully up to the standard of excellence claimed for
it, the testimony in favour of which is so over-
whelming, the reputation of which is unrivalled,
the durability of which is assured, the construc-
tion of which is simple and such that it rarely gets
out of order, and, in event of accident, can be
repaired at a trifling cost —if you wish a low-cost
and reliable TIMEKEEPER, which has proved
itself worthy of the high encomiums passed upon
it in every clime, by pulpit, press and populace,
you will assuredly buy a Waterhury.

Sydney TXT. holds that Parkes’ local-
option proposal, providing that the local optionists
of a district must secure a majority at the polls of
two votes to one ere their wishes are allowed to
take effect, is unfair, and that the local-option
party should be allowed to have their own way on
securing a bare majority as on any ordinary
question. The Teucohaph thus makes no dis-
tinction between an ordinary state question and
one so peculiarly involving matters of personal
liberty.
Wolfe’s Schnapps—It is grand.
The widow of the late Major Whyfcc-
Melville (now wife of Matkimonial News
Duncan) after the death of the sporting writer in
the hunting field, espoused an ex-fishmonger in
Dublin (the divorce of a Yankee wife) named
Higginson, who assumed the name Whyte-
Melville ” after marriage. The reverend gent —ho
had started in business as a parson—was after-
wards shot at while in a cab by an Irish clergy-
man whose daughter he had ruined. Mrs. Whyte-
Melville got a divorce after losing some thousands
through this adventurer
If in need of a stimulant take Wolfe’s Schnapps,
Count Festetics, the Anglo-Hungarian
snortsman, declined to receive Baron Hirsch,
whom “ Tummy” proposed to bring with him on
a visit to the Count. Consequently the Heir
Apparent’s self-invitation was allowed to drop,
and everybody is wondering how much he gets
per annum for maintaining a friendship which
exposes him to undisguised insult. And what a
crowd of snobs they are ! The “ social ” objection
to Hirsch is that lie continues to call himself a
Jew and appears to have more brains than any
ten of the “ old nobility.” But as he devotes a
lot of his intellect to toadying to Tummy, perhaps
after all the hereditary snob Festetics was
justified according to his own idiotic lights, in
refusing to have such a man at his table.
Wolfe’s Schnapps, the purest spirit procurable
Superintendent Have, in his Autobio-
graphy, has published an extra long chapter
about the Kellys, embodying all he has gleaned in
the ten years since. Ned Kelly, when young, as
henchman to Power, got the reputation of a
coward, but became a brilliant example of bush-
ranging education. Hare exonerates Standish,
who urged the Government to arm up the
troopers with proper carbines, and greatly
strengthen the Greta force, before the Kellys
broke out with the police murders. But for the
weakness of the officer in charge of Wangaratta,
the gang, thoroughly pumped out, would easily
have been taken alive, after this affair. Byrne and
Hart were unwittingly drawn into the murder
business of Sergeant Kennedy and Troopers
Scanlan and Lonergan, when MTntyre escaped,
by springing on Kennedy’s horse, which had
galloped away, after Kennedy screened himself
behind it, to fire on the bushrangers. Sherritt
told Hare that Ned told him that he and Dan
made Byrne and Hart kill Kennedy, because they
had no actual share in killing Scanlan and
Lonergan, wherefore they might have turned in-
formers. Hare excuses MTntyre altogether, for
if he had been murdered, the gang might have
burnt all the bodies, and never a word would be
known. Hare even calls MTntyre a brave man.
Wolfe’s Schnapps--popularity increases yearly
An American lady seeks divorce from her
husband on the grounds that he is continually
marrying her. He is a clergyman and a matri-
monial maniac, always seeking to be married,
though never wanting a new bride and always
afraid of flaws in the matrimonial contract. Con-
sequently their wedded life of eight years has
been one long honeymoon diversified by nine
trips to the altar. They were first married in a
Wisconsin Methodist church and were spending
the honeymoon in Dublin when Thomas dis-
covered that their union was not ecclesiasti-
cally perfect, and absented himself from the
nuntial couch until they were again made one in
St.'Patrick’s Cathedral. Inside six months a
flaw was discovered in the latest contract, and
another brief.separation was followed by avisit'to
a very High church. Marriages by Baptists,
Unitarians, Spiritualists, Presbyterians, and by
registrar followed in quick succession, and as
Thomas is a great stickler for forms and cere-
monies, the making-up of wedding-gowns, the
taste of wedding-cake, the fitting-on of rings-, the
selection of bridesmaids, the donning of orange-
blossoms and sempiternal honeymooning began to
pall on Stella. So when he proposed a visit to
the Salt Lake Tabernacle she revolted and issued
proceedings for divorce, declaring that what she
wanted was to settle down quietly and rear a
family, and not to rush round the world for ever
with a ridiculous man who was always behaving
as if they had been married yesterday, or were
about to be married to-morrow. Thomas is
weakening. He declares if she consents to
marriage in a Congregational church that it shall
positively be the last time he’ll ask her to marry
him.
AYER’S PILES are unsurpassed as a
remedy for constipation, biliousness, sick-head-
acbe, dyspepsia, jaundice, and the common
derangements of stomach, liver, and bowels.
They break up colds, mitigate fevers, relieve
gout, rheumatism, and neuralgia, cleanse the
system of malarial poison, and assist in the
formation of pure, rich blood. These -well-
known pills are compounded of the essential
virtues of the best vegetable cathartics, and
contain neither calomel nor any other deleteri-
ous drug. They may, therefore, be adminis-
tered in all cases where a purgative is needed,
without fear of ill effects. Being sugar-coated,
they are pleasant to take, and their medicinal
strength is preserved for an indefinite period
and in any climate. They should be in every
domestic medicine chest and traveller’s satchel.

Test Them Free of Charge.
What we are Prepared to do.
We are prepared to supply 100,000'of the Australa-
sian public with samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR
TABLETS, gratis and post free.
A Word of Advice.
Don’t write for the samples simply because we offer
them free of charge, nor because your neighbour does.
Read our advertisement through to the end, and then
decide whether you or yours need or would be benefited
by the use of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS.
We do not pose as philanthropists. This is a business
offer. We have an article that we know from severe
tests and from results achieved will sell on its merits if
seen, tasted and tested. Sulphur is the oldest, the best,
and safest remedy for the blood, for the skin, for the
connexion, for rheumatism, and for constipation.
FRAZER/S SULPHUR TABLETS are composed of
sulphur incorporated with cream of tartar and other
curative ingredients. They are much more efficacious
than sulphur in milk or treacle. This has been proved
time and again. They are liked. Men favour them,
women hail them as a boon, and children think them as
pleasant to eat as confectionary. They benefit all, and
are as efficacious and curative as they are safe and agree-
able.
Their Success.
“ FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS” are the
latest and greatest British success. They have so much
merit as to always do good. They are so palatable and
agreeable that a child will take them with delight. They
are so safe that the weakest person may take them with-
out injury. They benefit every function of the body by
tonic action on the blood vessels.
Why do we take this Risk?
This is what people ask us. We reply, because
those who write for the samples afterwards buy packets
of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS by post from
us, or obtain them from chemists, stores, or medicine
vendors. People likewise recommend and keep the
Tablets by them. The consequence is that we sell several
hundred dozen packets weekly, and the sale is rapidly
growing. This is trade by merit. The public have
shown discrimnation, and that they can appreciate merit,
and it was in firm reliance that this would be the case
that we were led to incur this risk.
Do 1 need them ?
If you have Rheumatism, Yes. They will kill the
decomposed and poisonous excess of uric acid in the blood
causing the disease.
If you have Constipation, Yes, They are a gentle,
safe, and a simple laxative, as suitable for children (in
smaller doses) as for adults.
If you have Hemorrhoids, Yes. They relieve the
congestion of venous blood at the affected parts, and
afford relief.
If you have Ulcers, Scrofula, Scurvy, or other
impurities of the blood, Yes. They neutralise the blood
poisons causing the diseases and expel them out of the
system.
If you have Skin Disease or Eruption, Yes. They
have a specific curative effect on all such, as they open
the pores from internally, and free them from obstruction
and disease taint. They likewise control where they do
not kill the disease principle from the blood, which causes
Eczema and other diseases.
Write a letter or post-card to the Australasian Dep6t, naming The Bulletin, and samples of FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS
will be sent you gratis and post free. They are for internal use for the Blood, Skin, Fevers, Complexion, Rheumatism, and Constipation. They
ward off Typhoid and all other infectious and contagious diseases. They are put up in packets, price Is. 6d., (post free, Is. Bd.), and are for sale
by most Chemists and Storekeepers throughout Australasia. - '

At this season of the year it is usual in all grades
of life to call a halt, as it were, in order to look
down the vista of the bygone year and over
the devious and profitable or unprofitable path
traversed during that period in our life’s journey.
It is now that one recognises most keenly the
failures of the past and determines, while making
new plans, to avoid errors in the year to come.
Here it is that the surveyor of the chain of past
events pauses to bury his past blunders and
to erect over them a sort of trigonometrical
cairn of wasted opportunities. But all have
not thus to bemoan days that have fled
never to return. Here is a case in point.
Sydney for years has been looked down on as a
sort of Sleepy Hollow by the more commercial
and speculative community of Melbourne, but
day by day that reproach is being rendered null
by the enterprise of a few of her citizens who
seem determined to make things hum in the love*
best of Australian cities. This enterprise is most
unmistakeably evidenced in the demolition of old
buildings and the erection of what may be justly
styled palaces in every part of the city, for
one of the maxims of the progressive business
men of the age seems to be that new goods cannot
be produced or distributed to advantage from
old buildings. Fired with this idea Mr. W. E.
Smith a few weeks back opened his new whole-
sale stationery, printing, and bookbinding estab-
lishment in Bridge-street. Fifteen years ago
Mr. Smith, a native of England, embarked his
savings in a venture out of which his present
business has grown, and by unremitting attention
to business and the exercise of keen business
faculties his business ever kept extending, until
its requirements demanded a new setting. From
this demand was evoked the present lofty and
substantial erection for the master-mind of the
stationery trade on land owned by him in Bridge-
street near Pitt-street. The new structure has a
frontage to Bridge-street of over 50ft., with a
height of over 100 ft., and is built mainly of free-
stone, with red brick dressings about the win-
dows, and has been constructed of such stout
materials that, despite the use of much heavy,
constantly-moving machinery, there is absolutely
no vibration to be felt on any of the numerous
floors. The building is divided into seven fiats, o
which we append the dimensions :—Basement
2770 ft.; Ground Floor, 2712 ft. ; First, 2736 ft.
Second, 2786 ft. ; Third, 2786 ft. ; Fourth, 2786 ft. .
Fifth, 2843 ft.; Total square feet, 19,419. The
top floor, the seventh, is the receptacle of the
banking goods, and here are stored reference
copies of all the important work done for the
various banks, syndicates, and private firms
throughout Australia. The next floor (ruling,
binding and paging, &e.) is the most interesting.
Here a ledger or cheque book may be followed
from its initial stage as paper or leather till ib
becomes the finished volume, fit for the desk of the
accountant. Here we have six ruling machines,
one of which, the latest, performs the most
intricate kinds of ruling with a minimum amount
of manual control. Here are several guillotines,
huge razor-edged cutters by various makers that
pare with ease and celerity the rough edges from
large masses of paper. Here also are to be seen
bevelling and backing machines, envelope and label
cutters, three wire stitchers, half-a-dozen embossing
machines (one self-cleaning), a mill-board cutting
machine, someblocking presses of tremendous power,
and perforating, numbering, paging and indexing
machines. Here is also performed, by hand, the
simple and beautiful process of marbling book*
edges. On the next floor downwards, the
fifth, we have the composing-room; here the
type is set, also where the copper-plate work
(a tedious hand process) is done, the litho-
graphing by hand-presses (the stones are dried
by atmospheric gas, an innovation introduced for
time-saving purposes), and the Htho - stone
polishing. Here is also placed the private room
where the Sydney University examination-
papers are turned out. On the fourth floor
we find at work the letterpress and litho-
printing machines, some of which are work-
ing in colours ; stereo and planing machines,
and a wonderful machine Mr. Smith’s own
invention (its patenting cost £1000), which
turn out 40,000 cheque-forms in a day numbered
in correct rotation, and can consecutively print
numbers from 1 to 1,000,000 without interruption.
It is almost impossible to estimate the amount of
time and labour saved by the introduction of this
apparently complicated piece of mechanism.
Looking at it one becomes impressed with the idea
that there are no limits to human ingenuity, and
begins to anticipate the coming of the day when
the bulk of the world’s work will be done by a few
nimble-fingered inventors who will sit - down at
occasional intervals to play on a lettered key-
board, each of whose symbols when touched seta
in motion some docile but terribly-powerful mam-
moth of machinery. But in those days capital
will most likely be nationalised, and such able
organisers and directors as Mr. Smith will simply
act for the nation as generals of the great army of
industry. But to return to the subject on hand. On
the third floor the paper and leather is stored, ready
for conversion into books and other business
requisites; here are working with almost noiseless
rapidity two large gas-engines by Crossley, of
Manchester, capable of working up to 50-horse
power, with which the greater part of the
machinery throughout the building is kept in
motion. On the ground floor are placed the retail
department, pen-room, travellers’ room, counting-
house, lift and staircase. In the base-
ment (a cool, airy, clean, and dry apartment)
is the packing department and ink-room,
and here the massiveness of the structure
and the strength of the beams and pillars may be
noted. It will be interesting to note the number
machines constantly at work in this hive of
industry :—l5 Machines in Letterpress Depart-
ment ; 17 machines in Lithographic Department;
55 machines and presses in Binding Department;
2 12-h.p. Gas Engines ; 245 ft. of Shafting ; 980 ft.
of Belting. About 100 employees are engaged
under the supervision of five managers in the
various departments, and by their hands over
80 machines are kept continuously working,
Each floor is exceptionally well lighted and venti*
lated, and on every hand are seen traces of
excellent management and completeness, Electric
bells, hydrants and speaking-tubes, and every
precaution against fire, and for the extinction of
fire; the latest and most approved means of
communication between different parts of the
building, and other appliances whereby business
may be expedited, are visible on every flat, and
the stock-in-trade, like the structure, is of the
best. Indeed, the machinery and stock bear a
valuation of over £70,000. As an indication
of the massiveness and stability of the build-
ing, it is interesting to note that, though the
large engines are 30ft. above the basement, abso-
lutely no vibration is felt, even when the
machinery on the third floor is in motion. The
prevailing impression after making a visit of in-
spection to Mr. Smith’s establishment is that no
expense has been spared in getting together the
most complete plant and providing that work
shall be carried on under the best possible
oonditions. It is also made evident, when the
names of the firm’s constituents are noted, that it
has earned the confidence of the great bulk of the
business people, not only in this but in other
provinces, and that the business, large though it
be, is but the germ of the mammoth concern
which must result from the rapid increase
in local population and production. Be
that as it may, however, Mr. Smith
seems to have fathomed the problem of success,
For it is evident that the mere possession of
money is not alone sufficient to ensure the success-
ful carrying on of any commercial industry, as
the numerous enormous failures "in every line of
industry bear testimony. Few men who started
in business inside the last twenty years with a
limited capital can point with justifiable pride to
a prosperous business quietly and painstakingly
reared on such unpretentious foundations ; there
fore it is evident that the faculties necessary to
the uprearing and maintenance of great mer-
cantile enterprises are scarce ; the methods,
either unknown, or difficult of acquirement,
His recipe, doubtless, would be unflagging in-
dustry, punctuality, intelligent supervision, good
wages, and the employment of all the latest
appliances that genius can invent and science
construct, indeed, there could be no greater
treat for those who have a mechanical turn, than
to take a trip through this establishment, to view
the latest modern appliances which have grown
out of the primitive methods of Guttenberg,
Caxton and Franklin. Dazed and astounded by
a close inspection of the ramifications of this
palace of art and industry, one is inclined to
receive with incredibility the statement of the
calm and unassuming proprietor that it is all
the work of his hand and brain, and that he has
managed single-handed to build up a business
vhose ramifications extend to all parts of Aus-
tralasia, and second to none of its class m the
Southern Hemisphere.

Old King Capital.
OR, JACK AND THE QUEEN’S TALK.
AN EXTRAVAGANZA IN THREE ACTS.
(BY EDMUND FISHER.)
CHARACTERS :
Old King Capital— A mighty monarch, but a
filthy looker when seen very olo.se.
Queen Delicate— His lawful wife, ivho was
bought by the POUND.
Pompumpus —The King’s Chamberlain, a haughty ,
but rather naughty personage.
Swagger Swigger— Chief Man-in-Buckram, a
costly warrior who charges the people.
Blackleg —The King’s favourite slave, a man of (/)
colour for everything.
Jack Hardgraft— The Natural Enemy of 0.K.C.,
Leader of the Tribes of Toil.
Fairy Bulletin —The Genius of Honest Labor.
Soldiers, Capitalists (old), Society-belles, Toilers,
Fairies, Ac., Ac.
Scene I— Marble Hall in the Palace of O.K.
Capital. Blackleg discovered chained to
the leg of a gorgeous throne at back of stage.
Music.
Blackleg—
Behold a slave, a caterpillar, worm !
I crawl along through life’s allotted term
Devoid of honour, manly pluck, or nerve,
Despised alike by them I thwart or serve.
By me be warned how low a chap may sink
Who oft lies idle, idolising drink.
While sober men are working for their bread
Base Blackleg hides his not diminished head
(Tis mostly swollen) and reviles his luck.
But when for higher wages they have struck
I sober up, on hearing of the news,
And take the work they beg me to refuse.
Vain are the efforts of my sturdy neighbour
To set me thinking of the rights of Labour.
What matters if it be of rights bereft ?
“ Good job ! ” I say, and go for what is left
Until I’m tired, or, others coming back,
I get re-tired—in plainer words, “the sack.”
(Pompumpus enters, and B. grovels.)
Low at thy feet thy slave is crouching, see.
Pompumpus—
A slave ! Absurd ! Please understand you’re free—
To call you so our daily press engages,
As your reward for keeping down the wages.
Yes, free as air, or as the rolling main.
(Aside) That’s why he, like a watchdog, wears a
chain.
(Again addressing B.) My honest friend, maintain
your pecker, pray—
(sounds of music without)
Here comes the King—now, Hip-hip-hip-Hooray !
Enter Soldiers, Policemen and Monopolists
(carrying special-constable batons) followed by the
King, with Swigger Swagger, Pages, Ac., in
attendance. King takes scat on Throne, and pats
Blackleg’s check, who licks the royal hand. Pom-
pumpus gets through the usual bowing, in the course
of which ceremonies he mutters, "It’s a dam had
’buse, ain’t it ?” and surreptitiously spits, pre-
imratory to
Song—Pompumpus and Chorus.
King Capital sits on his golden throne
And gloats o’er his ill-got greed ;
He laughs Ha, Ha ! when the toilers groan,
And mocks at the poor man’s need.
Chorus —The preposterous poor man’s need.
Great Capital sits on his throne of gold,
A monarch by Satan’s grace,
His joys are born of the griefs untold
Of the bulk of the human race.
Chorus —The dregs of the human race.
O, never a King so great as he
Has dazzled the eyes of fools;
In every land, on every sea
That sovereign mighty rules —
Each side of the line he rules;
New customs grow whilst old decay,
Fresh nations rise and fall;
And every dog must have his day,
But Capital lives and reigns alway
Tyrannical King of all —
Of wicked, and good, and all.
Capital—
Bless you, my subjects, ever most devoted !
Pompumpus—
Your Majesty, we hope we find you bloated.
Capital—
Yaas, pretty fairly ; things are looking up
And trade is brisker since the Melbourne Cup.
{Turning to S. S. ) —Of course you went for Carbine,
gallant Swagger ?
Swag Swig—
Your Majesty, I pawned my sword and dagger,
And having put those weapons up the spout.
On Musket’s son I laid the money out.
Capital—
A merry jest, indeed —but stay ! dimnation !
You didn’t leave the goods with your relation—
You took ’em out, we trust ? Your ready sabre
We look to ever in our wars with Labour.
Swag Swig—
Your Majesty has little cause for fear
I know my duty, and I have them here. {Pro-
duces 'whole armoury of implements of destruc-
tion. King descends from Throne and slaps
him on shoulder; they all advance to footlights,)
Song—Swag Swig, King and Chorus.
Swag Swig—
My name is Swagger Swigger,
I’ve a tall, commanding figger,
On the mob I pull the trigger
When your Gracious deigns to nod;
We have come to pretty passes
When the nasty, vulgar masses
Dare defy the monied classes—
Like their impudence, bigod !
Capital—
-0 ! the chief amongst the sources
Of our happiness, of course, is
Found in military forces—
The defenders of the sod.
Chorus—
Our fiery defenders
Of the grabbers of the sod.
{March round.)
Swag Swig—
When invaders a/en’t invading
1 am drilling arfl parading,
Or at Court a-masqueradmg
In my uniform so rare:
But when the Labour faction
Shows the least dissatisfaction,
Then I summon troops to action
And for civil war prepare.
Capital—
The kettle-drums start beating,
And the rifles (new repeating)
Play old Harry with the “ meeting ”
Ere the mob can say a prayer—
Chorus—
And the fragments of the meeting
Are sent flying through the air.
(Soldiers from square, with King in the centre.
Everybody else dances, except Blackleg, who gaily
rattles his chain. Tableau ! Soldiers manoeuvre,
and King returns to the Throne.)
Capital—
And yet I am not happy, not content,
Despite my hoard of unearned increment.
I keep rebellion down with sword and sawder,
And laws intended to preserve the hoarder —
And yet, and yet, my heart of hearts within,
I am afraid of Fairy Bulletin.
For ten long years—’twas 80 she was born in—
That frisky fay my side has been a thorn in;
Deeper and deeper still the spike is sticking —
Not thus the sides of my intent need pricking.
I shall be forced at last, in desperation,
To have her blood and stop her circulation.
Swag Swig ( kneeling before Throne) —
Say but the word and I all danger scorning,
(While he is kneeling Fairy Bulletin comes up
through the floor. She is dressed in a spotless
white robe and carries a glittering staff. Swagger
Swigger, not observing the vision, continues)
Will mash her fairy staff, and (F. B. taps him
on shoulder) O ! good morning.
{Exit Swagger Swigger hastily.)
Consternation in Court. Fairy Bulletin writes
with her staff a message in Volapuk upon the wall,
the characters stand out against the marble in blue
fire. )
Fairy Bulletin (chanting)—
See the writing on the wall
Of this royal marble hall.
Let another Daniel tell
What those flaming letters spell.
More of me
You shall see—
For the present, King, farewell!
{Exit down trap.)
Pompumpus (slyly smacking his Ups) —
Disgraceful person ! (aside) though, in fact, I’m
smitten,
(To King) Pay no attention, Sire, to what she’s
written.
I’ll rub it out and substitute fresh phrases ;
(Attempts to rub it out, then shrieks, and rubs his
hands in agony)
I’m burnt alive ! O, H ! I should say blazes.
Capital—
My poor Potnpumpus, let the nonsense rest—
Pompumpus—
Thanks, Gracious King, I think it would be best;
The meaning of those words we haven’t got;
One fact alone is plain—they’re awful hot.
However, I’ll translate ’em at my leisure.
And now, a dance, if ’tis your royal pleasure.
('King nods , and Pom. claps his hands.)
(Enter bevy of Society Belles singing.)
Ring the merry bells in marriage,
Ancient gentlemen of wealth
Beauty begs your hand and carriage—
Never mind your failing health.
Damsels once thought much of Cupid,
’Twas of love they used to sing ;
Now-a-days we’re not so stupid—
Ring the belles ! Ring the belles !
Now-a-days we’re not so stupid—
Money, money is the thing.
We have heard plebeian scoffers
Say that maids are bought and sold
Just as lambs, to whoso offers
Biggest price in lands and gold.
If that be, then choose the daughter
Of a well-connected dame,
Lead her like a lamb for slaughter—
Ring the belles ! Ring the belles !
Lead her like a lamb for slaughter,
To a life of “ honoured ” shame.
(A mazy dance: the old Capitalists offer cheque-
books, which the girls at first affect to refuse,
hiding their blushes behind their fans as they
glide around the stage. Dance concludes with
each venerable gent dropping on one knee at the
feet of his particular Belle, who accepts a cheque.
Tableau, Curtain.)
ACT 11.
Scene. —On the outskirts of a public domain*
Distant view of Habdgkaft’s three-roomed
dwelling-place.
“ The house was a detached one,
The outside old and mean,
And naught within those cardboard walls
The audience ever seen.”
Beautiful sunset, at the termination of which a
wild, towzled-looking person, with a paint-brush
behind his ear, appears at prompt side of the
stage and boxes his acknowledgments of the ap-
plause. Then enter an odd lot of fairies.
Chorus.
The weary day of toil is ended,
And the worker rests awhile;
Hither we our way have wended,
To receive him with a smile.
Lightly tripping come the fairies,
Singing sweeter than canaries,
Where we are there never care is—
Sorrow flies from fairy smile.
(Fairies break out into a gruesome, mechanical
grin, that makes even the gallery-boys shudder.)
Grand Ballet.
Enter Jack Hardgraft, carrying hag of tools
across his shoulder. Fairies smile again and
exit, to be informed by the stage-manager that
there isn't a, blanked woman in the whole crowd
knows how to shake a leg.
Hardgraft (putting down bag of tools) —
I’m tired out; eight hours upon the job
I’ve fairly been, and only earned eight “ bob.”
One “ bob” an hour! For sixty minutes toiling
Twelve pence to keep my humble kettle boiling!
It isn’t much ; the price is not appalling,
And yet, alas! it stands a chance of falling.
When trade is bad “sacked” labour bears the
losses,
And when ’tis good the profits are the boss’s.

S
ytinricA /c,
Of this hard fact each moment makes us surer —
The rich grow richer, and the w-richeA poorer ;
The pudding-maker oft from hunger suffers,
While all the plums appear to su-it duffers.
Ha, ha !no matter —I must to the cottage
To get my berth right, and prepare some potage.
(He picks up the tools and is about to move
off, when Queen Delicate appears, attended by
Sassiety Belles.)
Delicate— Pray pardon this intrusion, sir, I beg—
(pretended aside)
I must admit he has a lovely leg.
Hardgraet—
What is your business, madam ? By your dress
You cannot like the likes of me, I guess.
Delicate —O ! you mistake
Hardgraet — No miss I think of taking>
Nor want a queen, although my head is a-king’
(rubs his forehead wearily.)
Please let me know the object of your visit
With all dis-patch (points scornfully to the
Queen’s “make-up”) and powder—well,
what is it?
Delicate (coquettishly) —
Impatient thing! you make me feel quite
frightened—
Sit here, by me, and you shall be enlightened.
(Sinks gracefully upon a fallen tree-trunk and
beckons to Hardgraet, who sulkily joins her.
Sassiety Belles cough and retire out of (stage) ear-
shot. Queen taps Hardgraet with her fan and
■resumes.)
On working-men quite awfully I dote;
Come closer —there—now promise me to vote
For Tories only at the next election,
And ne’er to raise another insurrection :
The last one failed —I wish not to upbraid—
But think of all the harm you did to trade,
Although I must admit that, on the whole,
We made a little by the rise in coal.
(Tickles his chin.)
Now do be good, and don’t again rebel
Against the King, who loves you all so well—
Be loyal to the interests of Capital (presses close
to him).
Hardgraet (rising ) —
You can’t get fooling round this simple chap
at all,
Your eyes and jewels in the pan are flashing,
A “ bi g-pot” hater doesn’t like the mashing
Of artful, high-bred petticoat intriguers ;
Fur long I’ve had my eye on Primrose Leaguers,
Yes, all my eye you feather-brained decoys on,
And I despise you worse, much worse, than
poison.
Delicate ( coming after him ) —
Bad, naughty man ! how shockingly pervorsey—
You don’t show much respect for Lady Jersey.
Duet—Delicate and Hardgraet.
Delicate—
Prithee, let me coax and wheedle
Asa Primrose Leaguer can—
Hardgraet—
Go, or I shall get the needle,
I’m a sturdy working-man—
Delicate—
See, my fingers gently press yours,
In your honest eyes I stare —
Hardgraet—
Though you bade my lips caress yours,
Madam, I should merely swear.
Delicate— Much you grieve me..
Hardgraet— Can’t you leave me ?
Take your hand from off my coat—
Useless staying—
Delicate — Hear me praying
For your interest and vote,
(Both together) —
For
/your)
I my /
interest and vote.
(Queen curtsies, and Haedgeaet expresses h’ack
and bitter scorn.)
Delicate—
Let me spin my pretty story
In my toney tempting way—
Haedgeaet—
All your arts, fair lady Tory,
Quite in vain you bring to play—
Delicate—
See, I rub against your shoulder,
That’s a very fetching trick —
Haedgeaet—
E’en were your advances bolder
You would merely make me sick.
Delicate — You displease me.
Haedgeaet—Bah ! you tease me.
I don’t care a jot or groat,
For your smirking—
Delicate —I am working
For your interest and vote,
( Together)—
For
/ your)
I my j
interest and vote.
(Repeat Business.)
Delicate (pleading)—
Art still so cruel, still so cold, so icy ?
With me ’tis mostly veni, vidi, vici—
Haedgeaet—
Well, mostly vice y, all might say who’ve seen us—
Be this your motto Queeney, vicey Venus—
Delicate (snorting) —
Ungrateful creature, loathsome, low-bred clown >
Thank Heaven for our laws that keep you down !
(Summons the Society Belles, and is about to
flounce off when F. Bulletin emerges from the
trunk of a large tree.)
F. Bulletin (whispers to Haedgeaet)—
You’ve had a visit from this perfumed smilah—
Did Sampson hold his own against Delilah?
Haedgeaet (whispers) —
To lose her head I’ve lured the fowler fair on—
But I’m as right as Moses, with my hair on.
F. Bulletin—
I didn’t doubt it— (turning to Delicate). Just a
moment, Queen,
Ere you return to grace the festive scene—
I do beseech you, give your friends a hint
To keep from games that don’t look well in print.
But almost tempt poor, simple Tom and Biddy
To cry—’Tis money makes the mare go—giddy.
At dames of fashion Traviata scoffs.
“She ain’t no worse,” she says, “than lots of
toffs.”
I often weep, although the thoughtless laugh,
O’ er sins revealed by my divining-staff;
I hear of bruised hearts and broken vows,
And ructions ending in vice-regal rows ;
Of pretty matrons and young single girls
With lives embittered by the suites of earls.
When toffy suites a midnight thumping cotoh,
The process turns them into batter-Scotch ;
’Tis lucky, though, that heads are mighty thick
Which learn love’s lesson from a black wood stick.
But I’m digressing. Tell your friends polite
To keep their characters, like hands, quite white.
There’s too much courting in your circle courtly.
Adieu, so long ! Expect to see me shortly.
Delicate—
Audacious cat ! to talk like this —how dare you 1
No good, will come of the ill-will I bear you.
(Exit Queen and Attendants.)
F. Bulletin—
So much for her (snaps fingers), and now, to come
to biz. :
To crush the King it my intention is,
And make his bloated gang divide the spoil
From this time forth with all the tribes of Toil.
To-morrow night be ready, say at ten,
To make a swoop with fifty million men
Upon the Palace.
Hardgraet — Will his troops stand fast •
F. Bulletin —
No fear, your cause is theirs they’ve found at last.
No more will they give heed to Swagger Swigger,
But greet his orders with a mocking snigger;
The rank and file—on this I’m game to wager—
Won’t shoot a miner to oblige a maw.
Now understand, at ten o’clock, and this’ll
The signal be to swoop—l’ll blow my whistle.
(Blows whistle. Enter all the Fairies and a
few Toilers carrying implements of trade. The
latter dodge among the trees and endeavour to
look like a great multitude. F.B. takes hold of
H’s arm and leads him to the footlights, after the
manner of stage conspirators, The others follo w
slowly and stealthily.)
Song {sotto voce)— Fairy B. and Chorus.
F.B. —At the witching hour of ten
Come with fifty million men—
Chorus — At the witching hour of ten
He, with fifty million men,
Has to come, and—well, what then ?
F.B. —Come around the Palace gate,
Patiently awhile to wait —
Chorus — How long will we have to wait ?
F.B.—Till my whistle shrill I blow
Then like light’ning in you go—
Chorus — Yes, by thunder !in we’ll go.
F.B. —Like the whirlwind fly upstairs,
Take His Gracious unawares—
Chorus — Goodness gracious ! unawares ?
F.B. —All the rest I’ve neatly planned.
Trust to me, you understand ?
Chorus — Oh, of course, we understand.
{Pale stage moon rises at the rate of six inches per
second.)
Hardgraet {bending reverently to P. 8., and
chanting) —
Now, by yonder moon I swear
With my army to be there —
Swear by all the snobs in Hell—
By the ladder on which Parnell
Used to secretly retiah
From the chamber of Maria ;
Swear by Scott’s appointed seat,
Where he ought to sit at meat —
By the bounding ocean blue,
By the legs of Kyrle Bellew;
By the coming Jersey pair—
By Sir ’Enry’s ’ead of ’air—
Here, upon my knees, I swear.
{Kneels.)
{Fairies hop feebly around HARDGRAET whilst
Toilers perform weird mystic evolutions right and
left. F.B. places laurel wreath upon Hahdgrapt’s
brow and points to pale moon, which changes into a
silvery horse-shoe. Curtain.)
ACT 111.
Scene.— Hall in K. Capital’s Palace (as before).
Court ball in full swing—Capitalists and
Belles dancing minuet. Kino and Queen
seated in couch in foreground with Swag
Swig in attendance. Blackleg is still chained
to the leg of the Throne. Soldiers and servants
in greater or less profusion, according to how
the show has been doing lately. F. Bulle-
tin’s writing still gleams on the wall. Music
ceases.
Enter Pompumpus, who advances to O. K.
Capital.
Pompumpus—
Great Sire, may your shadow ne’er grow less !
I’ve just been fixing up the Daily Press
With Foreign News —concocting Tory fables
That duly blossom forth as Latest Cables —
“Disgraceful charge against the Irish Party,”
“ The Grand Old Man found cheating at Ecarte,”
“ More Noble Actions by the Prince of Wales ”
And so forth—but you know the kind of tales.
Capital—
Thanks very much—to-morrow morning sing
Them very softly to your Gracious King :
Of classic music far too much I’ve had,
I pay to hear it, and it makes me bad,
But sweeter melodies one can’t desire
Than those extracted from the Cable lyre.
{To Delicate, who has made a tremendous dis-
play of being lost in thought. )
You seem quite pensive, my expensive Queen —
Delicate —
I’m thinking, ah ! of all that might have been.
Song—Queen Delicate.
{This is interpolated, “ by special desire ”)
Beside the little babbling rill
I chase the buzzing bumble-bee,
The cockatoo his ballad shrill
Sings on the Eucalyptus tree—
The good old Eucalyptus tree;
I watch the yellow lizard sleep
Beneath the shade of fern fronds green—
The dream is o’er, and now I weep
For happiness that might have been.
Ah ! me. Ah ! me,
My life is dree.
Aweary is the mobled Queen
Who ne’er can know the ecstasy
Of happiness that might have been.
My crown of twenty-carat gold,
Bedotted round with mwels rare,
It is a brown straw bonnet old,
Such as the rural maidens wear—
The truly rural maidens wear :
My gown of print is cut quite plain,
My bare hands are not over-clean—
The dream is o’er, I weep again
For happiness that might have been.
Ah ! me, Ah ! me,
My life is dree.
Aweary is the mobled Queen, &c.
Capital—
A pretty song, but somewhat music-shoppy.

Delicate—
I draw a coin of fourpenoe on each copy
From Blank and Cos.
Capital— Egad ! upon my honour,
I never knew a primer prima-donna.
Come, Swagger-Swigger, let us join the dancers
And take our partners for the Sydney Lancers.
(King and Swag. Swig, choose two girls and lost
themselves in crowd.)
Pompumpus (to Queen)—
Young Hardgraft’s capture can Your Gracious
compass ?
Delicate —
Indeed I can’t, my excellent Pompumpus ;
These working men, except that thing (glances at
Blackleg) in fetters,
Are growing most uncivil to their betters;
My Primrose canvass surly Hardgraft spurns—
Pompum.—
No doubt he has been listening to Burns,
A dreadful person much adored by dockers,
Of whom you’ve read in penny daily shockers ;
His long clear head I’d dearly like tostampy on—
(Grinds heel on ground.)
Now, give me democrats like H. H. Champion.
Delicate—
O, he’s so nice, so calm, you know, and cool—
Says pretty things and gets his clothes from Poole;
He served us lately, and we must requite him—
Remind me (rising) that I ask the King to knight
him.
Duet—Queen and Pompumpus.
Pompum.—
Rads, there are advanced and torrid,
Holding all men equal quite—
Delicate—
Rads, like those are really horrid,
Most abhorrent in my sight
Pom. —We’ve a democrat globe-trotter
Who will languidly discuss
Labour strikes, or La Belle Potter—
(Together)—
That’s the sort of Rad. for us—
That’s the sort of Rad. for us.
(Dance.)
Pompum. —Rads there are devoid of polish.
Reaping only as they’ve sown.
Delicate —We prefer the Rad tol-lollish
Born with “money of his own.”
Pompum. —One, a beast of simple habit,
Smokes a pipe upon a ’bus —
Delicate (drawls) —Let’s have weeds and Hansom-
cab-it,
Together —That’s the sort of Rad for us.
That’s the sort of Rad for us.
( Dance)
King and Swag. Swig, come forward again, and
King conducts Delicate to Throne. Blackleg,
who has been crouching underneath, now crawls out
and looks appealingly up to the King.
Capital—
Great Vanderbilt! Why, what’s the matter,
puny ’un ?
Blackleg—
I crave your leave to go and join a Union
Emancipate your slave you might, I think.
Capital—
Absurd 1 (To Pom.) Just give him all he wants to
drink —
Colonial whisky, that’s the stuff that makes
A man quite happy—
Pompum. — If he cares for snakes (exit).
Blackleg— Do let me go.
Capital—
I fear he has turned kicker.
I’ll have to drug him—ho ! there with the liquor.
(Pompumpus returns with jugful of blue-fire, but
Blackleg refuses to drink).
Blackleg—
Don’t tempt me, honoured sir, because I'm off it,
I’ve signed the pledge, and Munro is my prophet.
(King motions Pompum. to put down the cup, and
kicks Blackleg under the Throne again).
Capital—
Well, after all, the stuff is bad in one sense.
Pompumpus—
But, Sire, this moral fit’s all stuff and nonsense
(winks at orchestra).
Song.—Pompumpus.
Doubtless you will think my ditty

Consternation,)
Delicate—

Capital — Dear, don’t be hasty.
Pompumpus (aside)—
He’d like to save her for himself—she's tasty.
Capital
This is the person who defaced our wall.
Swag-Swig—
It is—Oh ! let me like a soldier fall (faints, and is
removed to the hack).
F. Bulletin—
From Fairyland, O ! King, I have been sent
To change at last your form of Government.
(Mage manager at the icings strikes ten o’clock
on a saucepan lid.)
The hour has come, and now my message read.
(The letters on the wall emit such a brilliant
limelight that all, except Fairy 8., cover their
eyes with their hands. She blows a ivhistle.)
Capital— I’m blinded!
Delicate Dazzled !
Pompumpus— As for me, I’m and and !
(Enter Hardgraft and about two dozen of the
fifty million Toilers.)
Fairy B,—
Yon mystic message to this Court translate.
Hardgraft (reading message, the words of which
die out, one by one, and the company are able to
open their eyes again) —
Now King and King for good co-operate !
Hardgraft and Capital join hand in hand,
Each for the State, and for the State the Land ;
The young King active till, his work completed,
He sits where passive Capital was seated,
Who, passing on to restful regions rare,
Leaves Hardgraft’s son to claim the second chair;
And so, from age to age, two Kings shall reign,
While all men work with willing hand or brain,
With labour paying till, by labour paid,
The money-maker gets his money made.
F. Bulletin {to Hardgraft) —
Most worthy King, fidelity I swear !
Allow me (takes his hand and leads him to
Throne. Taps Delicate on shoulder)—
Let the King sit there f Delicate gives up her seat)
(to Capital) Monarch old in years remain,
Yet in mind be born again.
(waves staff over Capital’s head, and electric
lights appear all round his crown. Some evenings
the electric light doesn’t work properly.)
Capital (looking cherubic) —
Forgive my bloated follies of the past—
I’ve been a wrong ’un, but I’m right at last.
This is indeed a bloodless revolution :
(to Hardgraft)
We’ll pass an Act to change the Constitution,
And make it treason not to toil or spin—
Pompumpus—
This is too dreadful! Where do we come in ?
King Hardgraft—
Don’t fear, although you’ve never earned a crust,
You’ll find us much more generous than just.
(Pompumpus and capitalists look relieved.)
Release poor Blackleg (they do. B. kneels.)
Rise, misguided cuss,
Accept our pardon, and be one of us.
Keep off the lotion, and repent at leisure —
Blackleg —l do repent already, may it pleaseyer.
(Retires amongst toilers, who shake hands and
congratulate all round).
Hardgraft—
E’en Swagger-Swigger in our pardon now shares —
Boys, take their swords and make ’em into plough-
shares
(the army surrender weapons to the toilers)
Capital (meekly)—
Oh, how about the Queen ? She’s looking nettled.
(Queen bridles up)
F. Bulletin—
Well, that, old man, I’ve not exactly settled.
Come blow the pipe, and strike the merry tabor,
And shout —
Everybody— Three cheers for Capital and Labour!
Trio and Chorus.—Cap., Hard., F. Bulletin,
and Everybody.
Capital— This song is not a long ’un,
And it’s certainly the last.
I used to be a wrong ’un
In the days for ever past.
Hardgraft— O, lie used to be a terror,
But he’s altered in a night—
F. Bulletin —We must overlook his error
Now it’s all come right.
Chorus —All come right, all come right;
He was bad at the beginning
Of the yarn we have been spinning,
But he’s sorry for his sinning,
And it’s all come right.

The Brentnall-Mabbott criminal libel
action was tried in Brisbane after all. As every-
body expected, the jury returned a verdict of not
guilty, and the “honorable and reverend was
accordingly mulct heavily in costs for which
(once a parson always a parson) a collec-
tion ” is now being made. The verdict,
like that in the Bennett - Stab case m
Svdnev, teaches the lesson that, save m
a case of the direst extremity, the man
who runs a newspaper and takes a libei-actioii
against the fellow who slangs him, is a fool, ine
assailed man should simply use his own columns
to kick back. If he, is too weak or dignified
to do this, he will gain nothing by going to law.
“A newspaper-proprietor who sues a rival news-
paper-proprietor for libel deserves to lose, once
said the astute Sir Samuel Griffith, Q.C., when
consulted by a scribe who meditated issuing a
writ. The costs in the Bennett-STAH case, which
have to be paid by Mr. Bennett, will leave litt e
change out of a cheque for £1200. And for this
the plaintiff gets —what ? Simply a big advt. to
the effect that the Stab called his paper
“Ananias,” and that the jury dicai t think
mattered much.
You really ought to drink Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Reynolds remarks that the appointment of
Dr Randall Davidson, Dean of Windsor, to the
Bishopric of Rochester (which ex-Primate Barry
was fishing for) was a gross job to please Queen
Victoria. The late Dean of Windsor has had no
experience at all of parochial work, whilst the
poor are swarming in his diocese. The history o
Bishop Davidson is almost as entertaining as that
of Canon Duckworth. The latter was tutor in
the Royal family, and for qualities that have not
been publicly specified he was speedily advanced
to his present dignity. The new Bishop s rapio
elevation is due to not dissimilar causes. Me
began his career as domestic chaplain to the late
Dr. Tait, Archbishop of Canterbury, whose
daughter he married. At Oxford he took a third-
rate place, and, until his marriage, was considered
as capable of performing the work, say, of a
curate. But luck in the form of the Queen s
favour stood by him even after the avenues to
promotion seemed closed by the death of his
father-in-law. She sent for the handsome young
chaplain to hear an account of the Primate s last
moments. He came ; he saw ; he conquered. 1 he
Queen soon after presented him to the deanery of
Windsor. Her favour still stands by him, and
he now enjoys, while yet a very young man, the
dignity of being dubbed a Bishop. The emolu-
ments and the jobbery of the Church of England
are alike libels on religion. T he Dean of Windsor
has £2000 a year, with large perquisites and a
luxurious residence. The duties are so light that
the office is practically a sinecure. Canon
Farrar, who has just been appointed successor to
the Rev. Mr. White as Chaplain of the House of
Commons, draws the emoluments of two other
offices—St. Margaret’s Vicarage, £500, and a
oanonry of Westminster, £1000—while, in addi-
tion he derives a good income from the sale of his
works ahme. The death of Dr. Liddon leaves the
oanonry of St. Paul’s vacant. The duties of this
office occupy three months of the year, for the
performance of which a residence is provided and
a salary of £1000 ! What with the Archbishop of
Canterbury’s £15,000 a year, palace, perquisites,
&c., and a host of his colleagues’ enormous dram
ing the clergy of the Church may indeed literally
be poor in spirit, as our Lord taught, but, except-
ing the curates, many of whom are nearly as im-
pecunious as the dockers, they are certainly not
poor in pocket.

The following important fact cannot be too frequently
Impressed upon the minds of suffering humanity, tn
Mr. Gould, E.8.P., of Bradford, has for some time past
and is now giving the Hop prescription for Bitters to
all applicants who send a Post Office Order for Sixpence
for postage. Anyone in possession of this valuable pre-
scription can for lOd. make a quart of this marvellous
medicine, and for Is. Bd. can make two quarts, suffi-
cient to serve for two weeks. It may be interesting to
learn that with this prescription all kinds of hopele-s
cases have been treated with success when all otnei
remedies had absolutely failed. People who have been
partly paralysed have been relieved or cured with this
prescription, others have had their reason restored;
people who could not sleep have had their sleep re-
stored, others who could not eat have had their appetite
restored; people who had suffered years with in-
digestion and its consequences have had their digestive
powers restored; people who have suffered martyrdom
wth a disordered liver, nervous debility, ftc., have
been cured; people subject to an accumulation of
wind and water have found it disappear under its
influence. A gentleman, at Lincoln subject to fits
fortnightly has not had a fit from the first moment
ho began taking it. People troubled for years with
constipation have had their bowels become regular under
its Influence. It is a choice, rare, remarkable remedy.
The prescription is simple, it is cheap, it is good. Those
who haven’t sent for it should. It will be found safe,
sure, and reliable in a most all a iments incident to the
human frame. It is a tonic, alterative, and an apeuent
combined of marvellous curative properties. These
important facts may seem incredible, but it has dona
far more than is here claimed for it, proof of which Is
sent with each Prescription and it is given absolutely
tree of charge to all applicants who |® n< \ “ f os i !

A Brisbane journal states that “ there is
an urgent demand for a new blasting com-
pound.” There is at least one newspaper man we
could mention who, if Brisbane people would only
engage him, would be all the blasting compound
they could possibly require for a century. The
name is held over for various reasons, but any-
body who has ever met him at the Melbourne
Herald office, just before press-hour, and been
blasted by him, will require no further particulars.

A man was found dead beside a water-hole
on Cobran run, near Deniliquin (N.S.W.), the
other day. The police were sent for, came along,
searched the clothes and found nearly watch
and chain, then turned and rode home. Two days
after, a J.P. briefly interviewed the corpse, then
had it shovelled into a shallow hole over which
some logs were dumped down. The dead are
comfortable anywhere ; nevertheless, especially as
the poor fellow left the necessary funds, he should
have been stowed away with the conventional
formahties.

The brightest of eyes must fade sooner or
later, and the truest of loves must pass. Gener-
ally love passes very quickly, and then the angel
with the starlight eyes degenerates into a woman
with an indignant glare and a long milliner’s bill,
and after that marriage is a failure. Sometimes
it is more of a failure than it is on other occasions,
but as a rule it fails considerably. A few years
ago, for instance, a man in South Australia encoun-
tered a thing of hair —a creature all joy and glad-
ness, and he adored her from the top of her glossy
head right down to her two dancing feet, and
asked permission to be her slave for evermore, and
reside with her in a bower or thereabouts. Pre-
sumably she agreed to the bargain, for the other
day howls and groans were heard issuing from an
empty house, and when a policeman proceeded to
investigate he found a woman in an exceedingly
diminished wardrobe chained up to the wall. She
was the gladsome creature already mentioned, and
she was carefully secured in the bower herein-
before alluded to. The place was simply and
plainly ft rnished with a bucket of water and an
old dog’s-hide, and the window was nailed up, and
instead of going to the opera or indulging in other
expensive amusements the bride was accustomed/
to entertain herself cheaply by barking on the
floor. The loving husband who had laid his fond
heart at her feet now threw her victuals at her
head instead, and called round occasionally to
replenish the water-bucket. It was not altogether
what the lady had expected, no doubt, but then
few things in this world are what they seem.
Marriages, as a rule, are a failure, and this one
had failed a little worse than the average—that
was all.
The original genuine article —Wolfe’s Schnapps.
Bishop Stanton, the newly-elect of New-
castle, N.S.W., is greatly given to “enthuse”
over any of the many things which attract his
Argus eye. When he first w'ent to North Queens-
land this little weakness was dreadfully pro-
nounced, and the most commonplace things at
Townsville —the muddy creek, a tin-pot under-
taking establishment, the barren rocks of Melton
Hill, or the blazing climate—evoked such expres-
sions from his lordship as: “Magnificent,”
“beautiful,” “stupendous,” “entrancing,” &c.,
&o. Shortly afterwards the amiable old man
went ’Ome. While in London he tumbled up
against Bob Christison, a N.Q. squatter, and
consequently one of the Bishop’s flock (lambs, we
were going to say, but as events turned
out it was quite the other way on !).
Bob had a scheme in hand for freezing
cattle at Poole Island, Bowen, for the supply
of meat to London, and he explained it fully to
the Bishop, who became quite enthusiastic, and
deeply interested. A company had to be floated,
and lio broker was more anxious to fill the share-
list than the Bishop. At his mission lectures he
advertised the scheme and dragged it in somehow
at the tail-end of every sermon, besides inducing
numbers of his friends to take up I hen
he returned to Townsville, leaving the wily Bob
to complete matters in London. The first sermon
the Bishop delivered after his return was abso-
lutely nothing but an “ad.” or a prospectus of
the scheme. The church was crowded, and the
land-syndicators were powerfully impressed with
the Bishop’s shrewdness in cracking up and
developing the resources of his diocese. Soon
the meat-freezing began, but, after a fearful
outlay, had to be suspended—the thing simply
didn’t pay. In justice to the Bishop, it is but
fair to say that he was hit as hard, or harder, than
any of the other shareholders. Colonial experi-
ence has damped his ardour now, and he turns his
solitary eye on Queensland money-making schemes
with a gleam of anger and suspicion.
