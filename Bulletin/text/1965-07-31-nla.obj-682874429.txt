Before
you order another
bag or roll
of transparent
packaging film...
it will pay you to see samples and prices
on high clarity polyethylene film made
from these three polyethylene resins.
You may be paying more than you
need to for packaging film. The most
expensive high clarity films, for
example, cost much more than high
clarity polyethylene film.
By using high clarity polyethylene film
you can save a great deal and still get
all the clarity you need for your
packaging.
When you next buy film or bags, ask
your supplier to show you how much
you can save by switching to high
clarity polyethylene film made from
these “Union Carbide” polyethylene
resins: DFDLOIII for general pur-
pose high clarity film; UCAL42O2 for
high clarity film with low dust pickup
characteristics; DFDLOISO for high
clarity very thin film.

National Notebook
Livening up the Lords
T ord Casey of Berwick has returned
" from his annual three months “in
orbit” full of enthusiasm for the chang-
ing character of that institution many
of its critics regard as a fortress of re-
action; The House of Lords.
Taking his seat in the Lords for the
first time since Britain’s Labor Govern-
ment came to office, Lord Casey was
immediately struck by a change. Among
the ranks on both sides of the world's
oldest upper chamber was a steadily in-
creasing number of fresh faces. “The
creation in recent years of many new
life peers often younger men has
certainly livened up the debates,” he said.
“And I feel it’s a good thing.” Lord
Casey saw this new vigor in action
during the debate on whether Britain
should revise its 600-year-old homosex-
uality laws. After “long and outspoken
discussion on a very unpleasant topic”
the Lords voted 94 to 49 in favor of
the principle of changing the legal atti-
tude to homosexuals only to have the
Bill subsequently defeated in the Com-
mons.
The House of Lords, however, had
made its presence felt in an attempt to
reform. Its conservatism had been rec-
tified and this pleasing development, said
Lord Casey, was further evidence of
the emerging influence of the new life
peers. Lord Casey’s contribution to this
growing revolution among the coronets
was to introduce, once again, a debate
aimed at stirring up interest in Com-
monwealth matters. The only member of
the House of Lords who does not live in
Britain, he believes there should be more
peers from Commonwealth countries,
more voices to join his crusade to
strengthen the ties between Common-
wealth nations. Lord Casey can see
reason for optimism since his own in-
stitution in 1960 set an historical pre-
cedent. Now at last he feels that there
is a gradual change and affairs of the
Commonwealth are claiming more at-
tention. Never enamored of the heredi-
tary principle, Lord Casey says the
House of Lords is still far from perfect.
“But it is constantly improving and we
can expect much more from it in the
future.”
Love That Running
r I a he sound of thousands of frenetic
Frenchmen rising to their feet and
chanting, “Ron Clarke! Ron Clarke! Ren
Clarke!” as he strode through lap after
lap of a 5000-metre race in Paris is
not the finest memory the 28-year-old
Melbourne accountant has of his
incredible, record-smashing tour of
Europe. His greatest pleasure does not
come from this, or even the accolade of
the British Press that he is “the best
distance runner of all time”.
Interviewed on his return to Australia
last week, Ron Clarke was most
delighted when told of the remark of
former champion English runner, Chris-
topher Brasher, that he was the most
significant champion in recent history
because he had brought enjoyment back
to athletics. Clarke told The Bulletin
that he does not run for fame or fortune
but rather because he “just loves run-
ning”.
“I like winning and breaking records,
too, but, basically, I just love running.”
The proof of this is seen in his training
schedule; he runs at least 20 miles every
day and loves every yard of it.
The Trials of S.
enthusiasts have been wondering
why Orson Welles’s very important
version of Kafka’s “The Trial” has been
shown in Melbourne and Adelaide but
not in Sydney. The reason is, quite
simply, that the film was rejected out-
right both by the commercial chains
there and by the art theatres. It was
felt to have no commercial value.
Luckily the distributor, Nathan Schein-
wald, is a determined man. The film
will get a special screening for eight days
at the Union Theatre, Sydney University,
from August 28. Scheinwald first ob-
tained the rights to the picture from a
distributor called Douglas Watts of Tele-
programmes in Sydney. He had to race
to beat the ABC both here and in New
Zealand (where he is also distributing
"I think this transport system
stinks."
the film) because they had already ob-
tained the TV rights. The ABC’s print
still hasn’t arrived.
It is significant that even in Melbourne,
where Mr Scheinwald’s foreign prints
usually get better showings, “The Trial”
was turned down flat by the usual out-
lets. (If is showing at the Dendy Cinema,
an independent theatre in Brighton.) Mr
Scheinwald said: “The most annoying
thing of all is that the censor, who passed
the film itself in its entirety, cut scenes
retained in the complete picture
from the trailer, showing the stars,
Anthony Perkins and Romy Schneider,
falling to the floor in an embrace, and
a beating-up in a prison. This meant that
the one chance we had to promote the
picture—in trailer form was severely
hampered officially.”
Mild Melburnian Havoc
Tn “Who’s Who”, Professor Emeritus
Sir Samuel MacMahon Wadham,
lists his recreations as talking and sleep-
ing. It was while he was wide awake
last week that he told the Standing Com-
mittee of Convocation at Melbourne
University how he felt about the way
various people had reacted to the Martin
Report which he had helped to pre-
pare; people like Mr Bolte and Sir
Robert Menzies.
Mr Bolte had misinterpreted the
“leak” from the Martin committee
about proposals for degree-status tech-
nical colleges, and Sir Robert obviously
had not studied the report “an office
boy read it to him”. For the rest of
a 90-minute speech Sir Samuel con-
fined himself to a few blistering
remarks about the former “suppression”
of the Victorian Education Department,
the increasing dearth of technical skill,
and the general failure of Melbourne
to support university education. The
result was a kind of mild havoc in
best Melburnian style.
Mr Bolte being away on holidays in
Queensland, Acting Premier Mr Rylah
accused Sir Samuel of “irresponsibility”.
Always quick on the Press release, the
Victorian Chamber of Manufactures
found that it, too, was upset by the
Professor’s remarks.
How the peppery 73-year-old former
academic must have lapped it up. It
was like old times again. Up to his
retirement in 1956, after 30 years as
Professor of Agriculture at Melbourne
University, and for a short time after-
wards, Sir Samuel was always the unpre-
dictable non-conformist. In the ’fifties
he was in the news for saying that the
ABC news service had deteriorated and
was no longer properly impartial; for

NOW WITH EVEN MORE
PULL A
Toyota Lite-Stout, one-tonner, now has more horse-
power for greater pulling power and a new 4-speed
gearbox to make full use of it. The new 74 BHP
engine develops maximum torque at lower engine
RPM’s . . . gives better performance at all speeds
for city or country operation with less gearbox use.
Here is a real one-tonner of true truck construction
built to take the big loads easily. Load space is
biggest in its price range. Takes five full 44-gallon
drums—that’s a real truck-type load.
You choose from 3 body styles—standard steel body
illustrated above, a table top or cab and chassis.
Big cab is roomy, comfortable and seats three with
ease. Large curved panoramic windscreen gives
maximum all-round vision. Easy to drive, manoeuvre
and park—in this respect it is like a car—good
looking, too!
Outstanding among Lite-Stout’s many features are
the massive finned brake drums which give better
braking with less fade under heavy load, hard-
driving conditions. Lite-Stout, like all Toyotas, is
built tough to take the hardest pounding you can
give it with year round reliability.
Every day more utility and light truck owners are
turning to Lite-Stout—now with its increased horse-
power and torque, big carrying capacity, smart
styling. Lite-Stout is your best buy in the one-ton
field. Test drive today at your Toyota Truck Dealer.

warning that television would be the
most extraordinary piece of folly ever
put over the Australian people; and for
attacking poor quality synthetic clothing
pretending to be wool.
But we think Sir Samuel was at the
top of his form in 1957 when, during
another peculiarly Melbourne affair, the
Pleasant Sunday Afternoon at Wesley
Church, he appeared in the pulpit hold-
ing aloft half of a two-pound tin loaf.
Then in his very best that’ll-wake-’em-
up style he suggested that we could have
better bread cheaper if we would carry
it home instead of having it delivered
by the baker’s cart.
Helping the Publicans
T>ericles would never have under-
stood. In the city described by the
Armidale tourist guide as “The Athens
of the North”, the Council of the Uni-
versity of New England faces a big
decision at its next meeting on August
9. Should they allow the return of
room-visiting between the sexes?
The current controversy is an inter-
esting study in the politics of a small
isolated community. Being the only
university in Australia almost com-
pletely residential, one of the features
of this collegiate isolation up until 1962
was the fact that members of the oppo-
site sex were allowed to visit one another
freely in their respective rooms. But in
1963 the University Council banned all
room visiting. The official reason given
was that the ban was to improve
academic performance. Students claim
that if it was really because the uni-
versity authorities feared an imminent
upsurge of immorality the fears were
unfounded.
Demonstrations were expected at the
start of the 1964 academic year, but
the weak 16th Students’ Representative
Council decided to negotiate for what
it thought would be the easiest to obtain
relaxation of the curfew. A year
of submissions and negotiations brought
nothing. Thus, in 1965, the new SRC
decided that it was time for action, lest
the ban become hallowed as a tradi-
tion. It was decided to have as many
students as possible visit one another in
their rooms, thus risking a fine at cur-
rent rates of £25 each. The operation
was planned with military precision.
At 9.45 p.m. on Sunday, July 4,
the students marched into the appointed
colleges and were met and taken in
groups of six to the rooms where two
members of the opposite sex were wait-
ing with coffee. The organisers were
overjoyed, since 710 of the 1000 stu-
dents had participated and there had
been no incidents whatsoever. The prin-
cipal of one of the women’s colleges,
along with all her tutors, having wind
of the raid, left the college unattended,
paying a nice, if indirect, compliment
to the moral reliability and decorum of
the male students.
The Press coverage delighted the
students, and shocked the administra-
tion. A submission from the SRC
sub-committee to the council pointed out
that the ban had failed to improve
academic performance and had led to
a breakdown in normal healthy social
contacts between the sexes. But it had
certainly not prevented immorality. In
fact, many students had found that the
obvious (if less congenial) substitute for
coffee and a chat in their girl friends’
rooms was the liquid hospitality of the
local publicans.
Out on That Limb
npo all those radio listeners who keep
thinking that they hear Stan Fre-
berg doing religious commercials backed
by a vocal group with a swinging
upbeat “message” we want to say
you’re right, it is Stan Freberg. Actually,
there are two basic commercials
recorded by Freberg which keep pop-
ping up. The more intelligible one goes
like this:
“Well I can’t this Sunday I’m
playing golf and the following Sun-
day I promised to take the kids to
the beach. A man’s got to spend some
time with his kids you know ”
“Sure!”
“Besides, we seem to get along just
fine without church. You know, it’s up
to the individual. Gee look at the
time. I’ve got to run, but anyway
we’ll trot along to church one of these
days.”
“Uh huh. Well, how about two
weeks from Sunday?”
“Oh, I never plan that far ahead. In
two weeks, the whole world can blow
up by then”
“That’s . right.”
For those who might not have got the
“message” with this soft-sell approach,
the Freberg dialogue is immediately fol-
lowed by the vocal group, Judd Conlon
and the Rhythmaires, belting out the
clincher.
Where’d you get the idea, you could
make it all by yourself?
Doesn’t it get a little lonely some-
times, out on that limb? Without
Him?
It’s a great life but it would be greater,
why try and go it alone?
The blessings you lose may be your
own.
Sponsored by the United Presbyterian
Church in the United States, the com-
mercials are being played by local radio
stations in unsponsored time. After a
brief airing on some stations last year
the commercials were dropped. But in
Sydney 2SM has revived them and is
playing them currently as a “service”.
This follows a recent overseas trip by
station manager Bill Stephenson, who met
Freberg in the United States. Other
stations throughout Australia have
received the recordings. Does all this
mean a coming battle of the advertising
agencies for the God account?
ART FORGERIES
fdgfd
80 Years Ago: August 1, 1885
“Tt is stated that the replica of the
celebrated picture the ‘Roll Call’
by Miss Elizabeth Thompson, now
hanging in the Sydney Art Gallery, is
a forgery.” London telegram. Miss
Thompson's “Roll Call”, painted 10 or
11 years ago, having attracted the
attention of the Prince of Wales, of
course “made” the artist. A copy of it
found its way to Sydney some months
ago. The art critics of the “Herald”
went into hysterics over it said they
had never seen anything like it, which
we quite believe. Then the Committee
of the Art Gallery of which Mr
Fairfax, managing proprietor of
“The Sydney Morning Herald” is a
member—secured the prize for a mere
bagatelle 350 guineas we believe.
And now it is openly “stated to be a
forgery”. Should such be the case it
proves a good many things. It shows
also how the opinions of newspapers
can always be depended on especi-
ally when their proprietors are con-
noisseurs. And it shows that in our
Art Committee we possess a body of
men of intuitive perception, accom-
panied with practical judgment in art
matters. What we want now is a
board of artists to go round the Gal-
lery and tell us what are originals)
what replicas, and what forgeries.
Also, a commission of smart men to
enquire (1) What pictures have
been bought for the New South Wales
Gallery during the last ten years; (2)
the name of the seller, and of the agent
who made the bargain on the trustees’
behalf in each case; (3) the price of
each picture, and the amount of the
commission (if any) paid on its pur-
chase.

"Sheer McCarthyism. Can't they discuss Vietnam without dragging Communism into it?"


PLAIN ENGLISH
Dr Cairns's Referendum
TAr J. F. Cairns’s campaign against
Australian commitment in South
Vietnam reached new heights in Syd-
ney last week when he called for a re-
ferendum on the matter. In view
of the fact that the Federal Govern-
ment was elected on its defence and
foreign policy platforms, there is no
doubt where Australian public opinion
lies; a referendum therefore can tell
us nothing new. But more importantly,
Dr Cairns must know that no country
in the history of the world, except one
already defeated, decides grave ques-
tions of war and peace by popular re-
ferendum with all the bitter pas-
sions, the misinformation, and the
irrelevant side-issues they involve.
Eve«r if the impossible happened
and a referendum were held, it could
lead only to one result: flooding Aus-
tralia with appeasement propaganda,
while Australians are risking their lives
in Vietnam, would inevitably divide
the country bitterly and substitute an
active popular loathing of Left wing
and the Communists, instead of the
present cool contempt.
Nevertheless, Dr Cairns’s call for a
referendum is not surprising in the
light of the approach to Vietnam he
has been advocating throughout Aus-
tralia. The best interpretation of his
statements is that on his view Com-
munists do not expand their dominion
within any country by external aggres-
sion but by indigenous revolutions
forced on the populace by reaction-
ary exploitation; and that the South
Vietnam war is such a revolution,
not a war of conquest conducted by
Hanoi and Peking as part of Com-
munist expansion in South-East Asia.
Geoffrey Fairbairn demolishes this
“evasive obfuscation” on page 35 of
this issue: in Europe the Red Army,
not the populace, imposed Com-
munism on eastern Europe, and in
Vietnam surely only someone like
Dr Cairns could deny what Hanoi and
the Vietcong claim: that the Vietcong
is a military wing of the Communist
Party of Indo-China, whose centre is
Hanoi. This party decided when and
where to launch the “civil war” and
its object is the conquest of the whole
of Indo-China.
The main effect at the moment of
denying these facts is to justify the
Communists’ rejection of a score of
peace feelers on the ground that they
were made to Hanoi or Peking, which,
of course, are powerless to control
the independent Vietcong . . .
The Missing Ambassador
T'he recent visit to Australia of the
A Republic of China’s Foreign Mini-
ster, Mr Shen Chang-huan, again raises
the question why Australia does not
have diplomatic representation in For-
mosa. Of the various countries, in-
cluding Australia, now recognising the
Republic of China instead of the
Peking regime, 31 have diplomatic re-
presentation in Taipei, including
among the major powers the United
States and Japan, and among the
smaller powers the Philippines, Thai-
land and the Republic of Korea. Even
the United Kingdom, which recognises
Red China, has a consulate in Taipei
under the pretence that it is there to
deal with the provincial Government,
not the central Government. What pos-
sible reason can be given for Aus-
tralia not being represented, especially
while the Republic of China maintains
an Embassy in Canberra and a con-
sulate in Melbourne and Sydney?
The Republic of China has several
claims on our support. Economically,
Formosa is one of the success stories
of Asia. It was recently able to give
up American economic aid, since it
can now generate enough of its own
capital to launch its own industrial
and agricultural programmes an
achievement only surpassed by Japan
in Asia. Its trade balance is heavily
in Australia’s favor Militarily it has
been indirectly our ally, since its army
of 600,000 men and air force of
400 jets have pinned down some of
the elite of the Red Army on the
Chinese coast facing Formosa.
Formosa is admittedly no model of
liberal democracy although, of
course, one cannot speak of it and Red
China in the one breath. But no coun-
try makes decisions about foreign rep-
resentation on the basis of the foreign
country’s marks for democracy. (If we
did, we would hardly recognise any-
body except perhaps New Zealand.)
Sending Australian representatives
to Taipei would not solve any major
Chinese problem, but it would give
the Free Chinese some moral support
and diplomatic prestige, which if fol-
lowed up by bigger trade and student-
exchange programmes could only
strengthen Australia’s system of Asian
alliances.
Normalcy
A lthough it seems certain that the
Knopfelmacher scandal will be
discussed at the annual conference of
the Federation of Australian Univer-
sity Staff Associations in Melbourne in
August, it also seems probable that
that Federation will do little to help
Sydney University overcome its repu-
tation for political discrimination in
staff appointments. This is the only
construction that can be put on a Press
statement by Professor S. N. Ray of
Melbourne University.
Professor Ray, it appears, wrote to
the secretary of the Association asking
what it proposed to do about the
Knopfelmacher case. The secretary
replied that the Federation executive
was satisfied that normal procedures
had been followed in the rejection of
Dr Knopfelmacher’s application. It
apparently achieved this satisfaction
after having asked the Vice-Chancellor
of Sydney University whether the nor-
mal procedures had been followed; and
the Registrar replied on the Vice-
Chancellor’s behalf that they had been!
The executive did not bother to
make any independent enquiries of its
own, despite the fact that both Pro-
fessors D. M. Armstrong and R. N.
Spann publicly stated that they thought
an injustice had been done; nor did the
executive bother to communicate with
the aggrieved party, Dr Knopfelmacher.
So what we have is this: the stand-
ard procedure applied in all other
cases in Australian universities, of
accepting the recommendation of a se-
lection committee and of the heads of
the relevant departments, was set
aside in Dr Knopfelmacher’s case and
members of the Professorial Board
openly expressed political hostility to
Dr Knopfelmacher before rejecting his
application. Yet the executive of the
Staff Associations (whose president is
one of the professors who voted against
Dr Knopfelmacher) is satisfied that
normal procedures were followed. This
is what is known as academic self-
government.


THIS AUSTRALIA
ECONOMY
Cracking the Budget
Taxing the inessentials
HAROLD HOLT AND FRIEND?
A month ago public opinion was
obviously far too pessimistic about the
outlook for the Budget and for the Aus-
tralian economy, but the danger now is
that the current wave of optimism about
a “light” Budget will be overdone.
While the Government has been
deluged with good luck in the last two
or three weeks, there is still no getting
away from the central problem facing
the Budget planners at this time: during
1965-66 there must be a much slower
growth in the available market supplies
in Australia than during 1964-65.
This central point made in the
Treasury’s annual Economic Survey
an unusually frank and mild document —
has been largely obscured in the wave
of optimism which followed the super-
ficial headline treatment accorded one or
two passages in the survey where the
Treasury conceded that there would be
a slower growth of demand in the fields
of consumer spending, housing and busi-
ness vehicle purchases during 1965-66.
Much less emphasised by the Press but
equally important were the Treasury’s
indications that during 1965-66 there
would necessarily have to be a rather
slower growth of domestic output than
in 1964-65 (because the labor force avail-
able for work would grow more slowly
with the reserves of unemployed ex-
hausted and the scope for additional
overtime limited). During 1965-66 there
could be only a small further increase
in imports to add to the growth in local
output as against 1964-65 when there
had been an additional £3OO million in
imports—about one-third of the increase
in total market supplies last financial
year. Also a strong rise in private fixed
investment in new plant and equipment
and in non-dwelling buildings were ex-
pected.
In fact, the rise in the total of avail-
able supplies during 1965-66, from local
output and imports combined, is ex-
pected to be of the order of only £450-
£5OO million in 1964-65 prices. When
you take out of that amount a rise of
more than £250 million in Government
spending and £2OO million or so for
consumer spending, it is easy to see why
the Treasury is worried about how to
maintain the balance of the economy in
1965-66 —on this analysis there would be
nothing left for any increase in private
fixed investment (plant, machinery,
homes, flats, offices, vehicles) at all.
Someone’s spending plans are going to
have to be cut in 1965-66. As the spend-
ing plans of the Commonwealth Govern-
ment are sacrosanct, and as the States’
spending plans have already been severely
pinched (particularly in the works field,
where there will be an absolute decline
in the volume of activity during 1965-66),
the finger points straight at consumer
spending and private fixed investment.
The heart of the argument in the
Cabinet room will be about the extent
to which the growth in consumer spend-
ing and private fixed investment needs to
be inhibited through increases in taxa-
tion. Some Ministers notably the
Minister for Labor and National Service,
Mr William McMahon, and the Minister
for Trade, Mr John McEwen —may be
expected to stress the automatic inhibi-
tions which are already restraining the
growth of private spending.
They will point to the fall in farm in-
comes in 1964-65 and the further fall
coming in 1965-66; the tightness of
money and the likelihood of a continua-
tion of tightness for a few months; the
decline in confidence following the highiv
successful psychological warfare which
has been waged over the last year or so
by the Treasury, the Reserve Bank and
lately by the Treasurer, Mr Holt, himself,
whose bumbling and confusing state-
ments have appalled and unsettled private
business no less than the people in the
Treasury.
They will also point to the concession
made by the Treasury in the economic
survey that spending in certain areas will
grow more slowly (thus throwing away
JOHN McEWEN
WILLIAM McMAHON


to Treasury opponents a useful debating
point). They will stress that the inter-
national reserves are high and that there
is no need for haste in bringing the
balance of payments into balance (thus
turning against the Treasury one of its
own arguments, originally deployed to
stop any thought of the Department of
Trade getting Cabinet agreement to an
imports deposit scheme or other means
of directly cutting at the flow of imports).
They will agree with the Treasury that
the inflow of foreign capital during
1965-66 is going to be bigger than in
1964-65 (partly because we will be
getting such huge amounts for iron ore
and bauxite development). They will
raise doubts about the strength of invest-
ment optimism among businessmen (re-
ferring to the pessimistic conclusions of
the latest Bank of New South Wales-
ACMA survey of business expectations).
And everyone around the Cabinet
table will know that the small basic
wage increase and the most modest con-
sumer price rise in the June quarter
together give the Government still more
room for manoeuvre.
In the event, it seems likely that there
will be agreement on increases in taxation
sufficient to make the growth of Com-
monwealth revenue in 1965-66 roughly
match the growth of Commonwealth
expenditures. As revenues will grow
normally by about £l5O-£175 million,
additional taxation of the order of say
£lOO million a year (which is roughly the
same order of magnitude as the increases
made in August, 1964) may be agreed to.
The preference of Ministers is likely
to be for taxes on inessentials (beer,
tobacco), on petrol (in preference to a
tax on cars which would upset an
already jittery motor industry where the
powerful GM-H has the worst jitters of
all) and on incomes. Company tax works
too slowly to help in the immediate task
of keeping spending under control.
ACTU
Breaking the Line
Communists and the wage struggle
The majority decision of the Arbitra-
tion Commission in the National Wage
Case has created conditions in which the
more moderate democratic socialist ele-
ments in the ACTU have become incen-
sed with the stand taken by the Com-
munist controlled and directed unions.
The hostility to the Communists which
has followed in the wake of the wages
issue is vastly keener than any aroused
by their attempt to sabotage the Aus-
tralian position over Vietnam.
The ACTU is opposed to the Arbi-
tration Commission judgment mostly
because it abandons the “prices plus
productivity” principle which has been
the basis of basic wage and margins de-
cisions for the last five years, and be-
cause it substitutes for it the principle of
the “capacity of industry to pay”.
The ACTU has strenuously opposed
industrial stoppages which might weaken
its case and, perhaps, its right to a new
hearing by a fuller and quite possibly
more sympathetic bench.
The Communist forces have rejected
appeals for unity and have not only at-
tacked the Arbitration Commission award
but have initiated a fierce campaign of
criticism of the ACTU and on the whole
principle of arbitration.
The Communists are now claiming
that the ACTU was weak in basing its
case on the principles applied from 1961
to 1964, and thus applying for only a
12s. basic wage increase; they argue that
this amount does not gain enough en-
thusiastic response from the rank and file
and have themselves demanded that the
ACTU set. its sights on a £22 basic wage
immediately, and support its campaign by
a barrage of industrial stoppages through-
out the country.
The key issues which have emerged are,
first, that the Communist unions want
to use economic platforms as bases for
operations creating mass industrial and
political unrest (presumably because they
hope to use this weapon as a foreign
policy lever as the war in South-East Asia
worsens); secondly, they want all wage
and margins cases to be fought on eco-
nomic grounds, in' opposition to the
ACTU which wants margins hearings
to be separated from basic wage cases,
and margins to be decided on the basis
of work value.
The significant point here is that the
Communist unions, in attempting to base
their case for increases on economic
grounds alone, are adopting a position
similar to that of the employers’ organ-
isations and are weakening the whole
union case.
Mr Bob Hawke has frequently demon-
strated that if the unions fight on eco-
nomic grounds alone they completely
undermine their defence against a total
wage case. Communist policy is therefore
a barrier to the economic advance of the
majority of workers.
In the light of these facts it is even
more surprising that the decision of the
ACTU interstate Executive (which in-
cludes Communists and their agents) to
apply for a 12s. wage increase was unani-
mous, and that it was supported by
every Trades and Labor Council in
Australia.
There is a strong feeling in union
circles that the Communists and their
supporters have “ratted” on the ACTU
so that they could attack that body’s
present leadership and stir up maximum
industrial unrest.
ABORIGINES
The White Way
A drift from tribal environment?
It was unusual though hardly un-
expected illiterate, primitive fullblood
Aborigines sitting in plush upholstered
chairs listening blankly to learned coun-
sel discussing the pros and cons of labor
and wages.
It was the opening of the Common-
wealth Arbitration Commission’s sittings
in Alice Springs last week on the question
of Aborigines’ pay.
Some kind of demonstration had been
expected, following the picketing and
banner-carrying at the opening of the
wages case in Sydney two weeks before.
But everything had remained quiet and
orderly outside the hotel where the
Commission sat (Alice’s only courtroom
was being used for a Supreme Court
case).
Then as Commission and counsel
settled themselves down to business in
the swank brand-new meeting room at
the Hotel Alice Springs, with its sweep-
ing second-floor vista across the nearby
Macdonnell Ranges, the small crowd in
the public gallery began to swell. In
shuffled 30 or more silent Aborigines.
The men were mostly unshaven, hair
unkempt and occasionally braided up in
tribal fashion with soiled red bands;
clothing, dirty and crumpled, comprised
mainly of old slacks, shirts, jumpers and
ex-army greatcoats; feet crammed into
battered, bursting, down-at-heel riding
boots, old shoes, or smelly sandshoes,
sometimes bare.
The sprinkling of women wore grubby
cast-off dresses or skirts and jumpers.
Tousle-haired and shy, they shambled in
with the men. Veteran North Australian
Workers’ Union secretary Paddy Carrol
and welfare officers had spoken to them
in the streets, in creek-bed humpies and
on Amoonguna native settlement near
town, and tried to explain the need for
the Commission hearing and a show of
interest from them.
To those who turned up, the pro-
ceedings were an incomprehensible
mystery, but talking to them later showed
that behind the curtain of ignorance,
there was a faint glimmering, a realisa-
tion that changes might be imminent in
life as they had come to accept it.
It could be a massive change. Dur-
ing the first four days of the hear-

ing three Centralian cattlemen gave
their views at length of the Aborigine’s
value as a worker, - his capabilities and his
drawbacks. Detailed evidence was
brought to show that stations could not
afford to pay award wages and, if this
was forced on them, the Aborigine
would be tossed out of employment into
a sorry social world of hand-outs and
hand-me-downs. Their evidence Sup-
ported Sydney Queen’s Counsel Mr John
Kerr’s —appearing for the pastoralists—
statement of the position: “Starkly, the
issue here is whether we are going to
drive Aborigines out of industry on to’
settlements and missions where they will
live on relief —in other words, on the
dole.”
Last witness before the Commission
adjourned on Thursday evening was
youthful Mr Dennis John Driver, 24.
Mr Drivei, assisted by his younger
brother Roy, has run Elkedra Station,
a property of almost 2000 square miles,
since his father died in 1960. He voiced
doubtful opinions about the value of
Aboriginal workers but said he had not
“abandoned hope” of their being able
to secure equal footing with other station
workers given proper education and
training. He told the Commission he did
not place emphasis on the rudimentary
three-Rs so much as educating them to-
wards a “white line of thought”, or a
white man’s outlook and proper applica-
tion to work. But to achieve this they
would have to be cut adrift from their
tribal environment and culture.
L. W. ELLIS
VIETNAM
NZ’s Front
Men , money , goodwill
The New Zealand Government’s move
in sending troops to fight in Vietnam has
precipitated the formation of an advisory
council to mobilise support of men,
money, and goodwill in South-East Asia.
And the Prime Minister Keith Holy-
oake’s support of the council, which is
headed by the retired Chief of Defence
Staff Sir Peter Phipps, has generally
been regarded as a wise move. Mr Holy-
oake came in for sharp criticism earlier
for intolerance of opposite views and a
tendency to brand as Communist any
expression of doubt over sending troops
to Vietnam. The Prime Minister has
grown in stature over the initiative he
took in the Vietnam issue before and
during the recent Commonwealth Prime
Ministers’ Conference in London; his
suggestion that the Vietcong should be
at any peace conference table; his sup-
port for the Commonwealth Peace Mis-
sion; and his gesture in announcing
readiness to delay sending troops.
KEN COATES


VIETNAM
The Canberra Teach-in
Who won? Who knows?
Having first organised a protest at
Parliament House against Australian
Army participation in Vietnam, the
academic protesters and other interested
academics commendably decided to try
to ascertain the facts of the situation.
To this end, some weeks later, a
“teach-in” was organised at the Childers
Street Hall, last Friday. By 7.30
the hall was packed with a crowd of
at least six hundred people, mostly
students and academic staff, but also
including a sprinkling of army officers,
RSL leaders, diplomats, members of the
Department of External Affairs, and
other public servants.
The meeting was not “stacked”, nor
was the list of speakers. Any apparent
discrepancies in the weightage of groups
of speakers in any section was the
result of chance oi the refusal of the
Government to permit External Affairs
speakers to appear.
Round one between Mr Tom Hughes,
MHR, and Senator Sam Cohen was
fought in decent silence for the most part.
Hughes’ statement of the Government
case was formidable. Sam Cohen argued
that the Government’s case was alto-
gether too “unsophisticated” and then
proceeded to give an amiably expressed
account of orthodox opposition, fortified
by an easily lovable personality, and
embellished by references to world food
problems and remarks about our chances
to build a happier world. If he had not
played the “Boy from the Bush Full of
Goodwill” so efficiently, while berating
the Government’s lack of sophistication,
he might have more effectively matched
Tom Hughes’ calm, yet intense and
sincere, forensic performance.
Mr Morris West and Mr Francis
James appeared together infclhe next
bout, pitted against Mr Peter Samuel.
Morris West spoke with eloquent fervor
against the moral ambiguities involved in
Australia’s participation in a war in Asia
about which continent it had shown too
little concern in the past. He presented
his case movingly, but without showing
the political knowledge his time in
Saigon had led some people to expect.
(The loudest applause, incidentally, came
as a result of his strictures on the
insouciance of Sir Robert Menzies’
approach to things Asian, war in par-
ticular. That lost decade, defencewise
and so, moralewise, has inevitably raised
scepticism and reduced commitment
amongst the younger generation.)
Peter Samuel, looking very like D. H.
Lawrence without Lawrence’s “chip”,
introduced himself as a “rough” jour-
nalist, and proceeded (with only the
“roughness” of deep sincerity) to criticise
both sides in some particulars while
developing the important theme that a
victory for Communist revolutionary
warfare in Vietnam might well give “the
Chinese way” the appearance of being
the way ahead for Communist parties.
Mr lan Bedford touched upon the
plight of the peasantry in the face
of industrialisation and modernisation,
whichever side won. He described,
in so far as it can be described to non-
peasants, the subterranean springs of
peasant unrest; and he believes that
peasants believe they are taking part in
a true liberation war.
Geoffrey Fairbairn concentrated upon
the organisation of Communism through-
out Vietnam and endeavored to docu-
ment Hanoi control of an all-Vietnamese
organisation which in effective essentials
remains what it was at its foundation in
1930: a Communist Party of Indo-China
controlling operations not only in South
Vietnam but in Laos and Cambodia and
the Vietnamese community living along
the Thai bank of the Mekong, where
Peking has announced the imminence of
another “spontaneous insurrection”.
With chilling logic Professor C. P.
Fitzgerald adumbrated his theme about
the almost “natural”, certainly inevitable,
reassertion of China’s old sphere of
interest in South-East Asia.
And so it went on Robert Cooksey
arguing with the confidence of a states-
man that the only casualty of an Ameri-
can withdrawal would be the “Domino
theory” regarding the collapse of morale
elsewhere in South-East Asia. Hanno
Weisbrod (another Fh.D student but an
American) argued the case for South
Vietnam as a State, recognised by at least
half the United Nations, having been,
for all effective purposes, invaded and
hence entitled to seek outside aid. He
was so unfairly heckled, for the first time
throughout the evening it was about 1
a.m. by then—by Francis James that an
opponent of his line said to our reporter:
“He’s earning his promotion” (to first
lieutenant in the US Army Reserve).
It went on until 3.30 a.m. Who won?
Who knows? A diplomat observer said
that it was a draw.
TEACHERS
A Grass-roots
Revolt?
NSW Federation elections
After the recent abortive attempt by
the leaders of the New South Wales
Teachers’ Federation to link the 30,000
State school teachers with the Com-
munist-front Association for Interna-
tional Co-operation and Disarmament, a
great deal hangs on the coming election
of the three top officers of the Federa-
tion.
Although the closing of nominations
for the positions of president, deputy
president, and senior vice-president of
the Federation are only a little more than
a fortnight away, there is still no cer-
tainty that the dominant Left-wing ele-
ment will be opposed.
Veteran Teachers’ Federation official,
Mr S. P. Lewis, who led the move to
affiliate with the Association for Inter-
national Co-operation and Disarmament,
has announced on several occasions—
the most recent at a Federation Council
meeting a fortnight ago that he does
not intend contesting his post of presi-
dent. Despite this, his nomination is
still not ruled out at this stage. Both
the deputy president, Mr W. J. Whalan,
and Miss E. M. Mattick, who have been
closely identified with Mr Lewis's policies
are expected to stand again.
However, there are some hopes among
the Right-wing and moderate elements in
the Federation that the grass-roots revolt

of teachers against the move to affiliate
with the AICD may force the Federa-
tion into a centre-road position. But
apparently, as with a number of “mili-
tant” unions, activism among the teachers
is only leadership-deep.
The last period when both Left and
Right were really organised in the
Teachers’ Federation was in the early
’fifties when the Right, marshalled by a
primary-school headmaster, Mr Ernie
Bray, forced a head-on clash with the
president, Mr Lewis, ousting him from
the office he had held from the mid-
’forties.
Left-wing and Communist forces only
went into an apparent decline. With the
defeat of Mr Lewis, the Communists
re-grouped for a concentrated campaign
in country areas of the diffuse Federa-
tion. They began to return to the city in
the mid-’fifties, by which time Mr Lewis
had returned as deputy president. He
did not become president again until
1963, but before, and until the AICD
move, executive policies carried an out-
wardly fine balance os Left, Centre, and
Right weights.
The Teachers’ Federation is extremely
open to manipulation by factions. The
30,000 members are currently made up
of 216 interest groups—l4s of which are
in the country—with members of these
groups ranging from the minimum 15 to
the Secondary Teachers’ Association
which has some 3000 members.
Although a current reform suggests cut-
ting back the membership of the voice
of these interest groups, the Council, to
150 members, there is at the moment a
Council of 216 members, which in theory,
should meet every fortnight at Federa-
tion House in Phillip Street. In fact, the
average attendance would be below 100.
Very few ballots are held for Council
members. Indeed, last year ballots were
held in only four groups. For 20 groups
fresh nominations had to be called and
four of these are still without any
Council candidates whatsoever. From this
Council 14 executive members are
elected annually to work with the three
senior officers. These executive positions
seem to be only just a little more vigor-
ously contested than the Council places.
There is a regular pre-executive caucus
of Council to see that the positions are
filled with a cross section of the political
and teacher-interest groups.
At the last election of the top three
officers two years ago less than 50 per
cent of the rank-and-file voted. And
despite the hopes of moderates and
Right-wingers, there is as yet little sign
that the forthcoming ballot will arouse
appreciably more interest among teachers
themselves.
However, the State Minister for Edu-
cation, Mr C. Cutler, can be expected to
watch the nomination and election out-

comes closely. Overshadowing the in-
dustrial issues of salary and teacher-
training which are still to be settled, is
the NSW Government’s election promise
to establish an Education Commission.
This Commission is to be made up cf
two Governent representatives, tw'O
teachers, and a Government-appointed
chairman.
The Federation is claiming the right
to nominate the two teacher representa-
tives and are insisting that the chairman
be acceptable to the Federation as well
as to the Government. Last week
Federation officials were claiming that
the Premier, Mr Askin, as Leader of the
Opposition, had given the teachers an
assurance that these demands would be
met. They said that they first had dis-
cussions with Askin on the establishment
of the Commission to take State school
teachers outside the authority of the
Public Service Board in November last
year. And in an April circular, “Deci-
sions of Council —3rd April, 1965”, the
Federation reported to its member
groups:
“The president reported that on April
1 a deputation from the Federation dis-
cussed Federation proposals for an Edu-
cation Commission with Mr R. W. Askin,
Leader of the Opposition in the State
Parliament . . .
“He said that he is prepared to
agree to the number of the Commission
being five instead of three as previously
proposed by him on behalf of the
Liberal Party. When it was pointed out
to him that the Federation would not
agree to 'submitting nominations to a
panel from whom Commission members
would be appointed, he said the proposal
for a panel would be withdrawn. He
said the chairman should be a person
of standing and independent outlook and
there would have to be agreement be-
tween the Federation and the Govern-
ment concerning the chairman if the
scheme were to work.”
Given the history of the Communist-
infiltrated Federation it is difficult to
see Mr Askin finally ratifying these pro-
posals. But if he does not, there is
certain trouble ahead.
MALAYSIA
Josey
Stating the position
The Malaysian Embassy late last week
released correspondence on the Alex Josey
affair. It said it was doing this because
of an article in “The Bulletin” of July 17.
The Embassy released a statement by
the Malaysian Ministry of Home Affairs
on correspondence between the Foreign
Correspondents’ Association of South-
East Asia and the Minister of Home
Affairs, Dato (Dr) Ismail. The statement
said: “It had been previously stated that
the Central Government considered that
from its point of view the case of Alex
Josey was closed. However, in view of
the fact that The Bulletin in its issue
of July 17 has an editorial on the subject
with a specific reference to the Foreign
Correspondents’ Association of South-
East Asia, it is necessary to make the
position clear in this regard.
“The Bulletin stated that the same
Association has rightly protested against
Alex Josey’s expulsion and described it
as a ‘grave threat to the profession in
Malaysia’. This is a distortion from a
letter sent by the Association which used
the phrase ‘since the Government’s
action can be seen as a grave threat to
the profession in Malaysia’.”

The Left Can Wait
By ALAN REID
T>ight-wing Labor leaders have
almost invariably been wrong
when they have tried to forecast
and counter —likely Left-wing tactics
in the Labor Party struggle of recent
years. The basic reason for this is that
they start from the wrong premise.
They give their Left-wing opponents
credit for honesty of purpose. They
assume that the Left-wingers, like
themselves, want to replace the present
Menzies Liberal-Country Party coali-
tion Government with a Labor ad-
ministration.
This is only partially correct. The
Left-wingers certainly want to replace
the Menzies Government with a Labor
administration. But they want it sub-
ject to their management and domina-
tion, an administration which in
government will accept and follow,
particularly in international affairs,
policies laid down by the Left-wing
controllers of the ALP machine.
It is against this background, and
with the Left wing giving a higher
priority to Left-wing control of the
A L P machine
than to Labor’s
electoral pro-
spects, that the
Federal ALP con-
ference will meet in Sydney early next
month for what could be as important
a meeting as any in Labor’s recent
history.
Starting from their wrong premise,
the ALP’s Right-wingers believe that
the Victorian delegation to the con-
ference will not push to the point of
damaging further Labor’s electoral
prospects at future Federal elections
the Victorian proposition that the
ALP lift its Federal ban on Unity
Tickets between ALP members and
Communists in trade-union elections.
The Left-wingers would be com-
mitting political suicide, the Right-
wingers argue, therefore they will
abandon their pro-Unity Ticket pro-
position.
Oddly, the Left-wingers are not the
ones who are deceiving the Right-
wingers. They do not have to. The
Right-wingers are deceiving them-
selves. The Left-wingers are making
no secret of the fact that if they do
not push on with their pro-Unity
Ticket proposition at the conference,
they will not be abandoning the pro-
position. They will merely be holding
off until they get a more auspicious
time to have it dealt with.
They have indicated to their Right-
wing counterparts that they are pre-
pared to accept a compromise pro-
posal on Unity Tickets—one that will
enable the Right Wing to claim that the
ALP has not endorsed Unity Tickets
and yet will enable the Left wing to
operate Unity Tickets with impunity,
and without threat of discipline.
They accept that the trouble they
have already caused about Unity
Tickets, which has had the effect of
discrediting Labor electorally even in
States where the Federal ban on Unity
Tickets is either wholly or partially
enforced, could cause further losses
of seats for Labor at the next Federal
elections, due in 1966.
But they quite cheerfully point out
that those who would lose their seats
and they name them would be
supporters of Mr Gough Whitlam, the
present Labor Party deputy leader
(who has come out publicly against
Unity Tickets as a means whereby
the Communist Party is subverting the
ALP). With these Whitlam supporters
missing from the Federal Parliament-
ary Labor Party Caucus they would
have a much bet-
ter chance of get-
ting Dr Cairns
elected as leader.
The Left-wing-
ers are realistic to the extent that they
do not expect electoral support to
swing to them when they succeed in
having Dr Cairns as Federal leader
and Unity Tickets accepted in prac-
tice if not quite accepted theoretically.
They are, however, prepared to wait.
They point out that the present Men-
zies Government has been in office
nearly 16 years. It is a coalition Gov-
ernment, and the history of coalition
governments is that sooner or later
they disintegrate. The Left-wingers say
that when that ultimately happens
they will not need electoral popularity.
They will be the only alternative
Government, and, whether they are
liked or disliked, they will be the only
group in a position to provide a
government.
The one risk they take is the emer-
gence of a third force which in the
event of a crisis on the non-Labor side
would be an alternative to a Left-wing-
controlled Labor as an alternative
government. So far such a force has
not emerged, and it is upon the non-
emergence of such a force that the
ALP Left wing is relying heavily for
the working out of its long-term plans,
to which the outcome of the forth-
coming ALP conference, while im-
portant, is not necessarily vital.
CONSCRIPTION
The Good
Member
“Working for peace ”
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
Bearded, 20-year-old member of the
Communist Party and Eureka Youth
League, Robin Peter Kitching, who had
his application for total exemption from
national service refused this week, told
the Special Federal Court in Sydney he
believed Australia should have sur-
rendered when threatened by the Japan-
ese in 1942.
Kitching, a builder’s laborer who
defended himself and who refused to
swear on the Bible because he Hield
no religious views, told Mr C. S.
Rodgers, SM, he was opposed to all
forms of military activity, whether com-
batant or non-combatant. “War serves
no purpose other than to destroy man-
kind. I don’t believe it’s right for a
man to fight, and the National Service
Act is undemocratic,” he said.
During the hearing, Kitching said he
also believed Russia should have sur-
rendered to the Germans; China was
wrong in going into Tibet; the Vietminh
in Indo-China were wrong to fight the
French; the intervention by Russia in
Hungary during 1965 was wrong.
Appearing for the Commonwealth
and Minister for Labor and National
Service, Mr G. V. Halliday asked Kitch-
ing had he studied the constitution of
the Eureka Youth League. Kitching said
he had never read it and did not think
it necessary. Asked what some of the
aims and objects of the EYL on peace
were, he said, “peaceful co-existence
between the nations. We don’t believe
in war.”
Mr Halliday: One of the aims of the
EYL is to study Marxism and Leninism
to “thus equip themselves to work for
peace”?
Kitching: I don't believe you have to
study Marx and Lenin to work for peace.
Mr Halliday: Do you know whether
this is the current policy of the Com-
munist Party with regard to peace that
they would make no military defence
of Australia?
Kitching: The Communist Party would
(defend Australia) but many of its mem-
bers wouldn't.
Mr Halliday: Do you agree the EYL’s
constitution currently points out that
the USSR heads the forces of peace?
I don’t recall. Therefore you deny the
USSR leads peace in the world? I

TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling,
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine Study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green, bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

don't believe any country is capable of
leading peace.
Mr Halliday: The Communist Review
of January, 1942, states: The party of
the working class the Communist
Party must become the leading war
party. Do you consider this was wrong?
Yes. Therefore you say the Central
Committee of the Communist Party at
that time was wrong? Yes. Kitching
agreed that a leaflet published by the
League in 1950 opposed conscription
and a League magazine this year also
opposed conscription.
Mr Halliday: You have also agreed
you heard and know that the CP, prior
to Japan entering the war, opposed con-
scription. You know the CP became a
supporter of conscription in 1943? I
knew this, but not when. Do you think
this shows that the CP can change its
policy with regard to war and conscrip-
tion?— Yes, it does.
ROBIN PETER KITCHING
Mr Rodgers, interjecting: Although
you're a member of the CP and EYL
you don’t believe in a lot of things they
believe in? Yes. Do you regard your-
self a good member of the CP and
EYL? I say I’m a good member so I
am able to criticise the party when I
believe they are doing something wrong.
Mr Halliday: The constitution of the
CP states “all party members must
carry out party decisions”. Kitching: I
disagree with that. Mr Halliday: What
do you think of Australian troops in
Vietnam? I believe they're wrong in
going. You would oppose volunteer
troops in Malaya? Yes. You would
oppose the Vietcong? I oppose the
tactics they’re using. Are you quite cer-
tain you're not making a tactic out of
peace? I have already stated this is
my conscientious belief. Can you be sure
that you know the EYL and the CP
aren’t using peace as a tactic? They
could be. You are not a dupe of this?
This is correct.
Mr Rodgers ruled that Kitching should
carry out non-combatant duties.

On a dear day
you 7/ see these
34 floors
60 miles away
(but you’ll never see its 246,960 square feet
of Celdek steel decking)
Its 34th floor will be closer to the clouds than any
other building in Sydney. Its foundations are
deeper. It has more structural steel. More
concrete. More nuts, bolts, rivets. It has more
welders, dogmen, crane drivers, working on it.
It will have more panes of glass, more telephone
extensions, more amenities. More plumbers,
electricians, carpenters, plasterers, painters. More
people working on it. More people working in it.
More of just about everything. It’s the 34-floor
State Offices in Macquarie Street, Sydney’s tallest
building. With the tallest view (outside aircraft)
of almost any part of Sydney and its suburbs.
Who’s who in these new State Offices? The
Department of Public Works, The Department of
Agriculture, The Premier’s Department, The
State Treasury, Local Government Departments,
etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. And underneath those
34 stately floors, hidden in concrete to form
strength and provide essential services, lies
246,960 square feet of Celdek steel decking. A
modern, lightweight, high-strength, galvanized steel
cellular floor deck that helps architects design with
greater freedom, helps engineers design with
greater flexibility, helps contractors build with
greater savings in cost. For those wanting to know

Dateline Bien Hoa
Inadequate equipment in the war without fronts
By ANTHONY CAVE BROWN
The commitment of Australian
troops in support of the South
Vietnamese Government has ex-
posed many organisational inadequacies
in the Australian Army. The men are
in great spirits, they are superbly trained,
and their command is one of the best
I have encountered in ten years of war
reporting. But the organisational in-
adequacies require urgent Government
attention.
The First Battalion of the Royal Aus-
tralian Regiment is now in the line in
support of the 173rd Airborne Brigade
of the United States Army. Their
mission is to defend a sector of the
perimeter of the Bien Hoa air base and
installation, worth two billion dollars,
which is vital to the free world’s cause
in Asia.
The Australian positions are separated
from War Zone D a Vietcong strong-
hold of about 10,000 men less than 25
miles from Saigon —by river and 5000
yards of scrub, rice paddy and dying
rubber plantations. The troops are in
constant danger of assault. The latest
intelligence reports indicate the Vietcong
has succeeded in crossing the Dong Sai
River in two-battalion strength and have
holed up in well-concealed and deeply
dug bunkers close to the Australian
fortifications. Bien Hoa airfield itself
has already come under intermittent
mortar and sniper fire and Vietcong
attack on the Australian positions can-
not be long delayed.
This is a war without fronts. The
enemy is so subtle that rarely can he
be found or heard. It is a war of intense
discomfort: fierce rainstorms, high
humidity, mud, water-logged fox-holes,
leeches, ticks, snakes, sleeplessness and
that ever-present sense of danger. Yet the
Australian fighting man does not com-
plain about being there. As Lieut-Col
R. W. Brumfield, the commanding officer,
said to me: “All the digger wants to do
is to get at the throats of the enemy.”
Yet in my opinion they are not
receiving a fair deal. The most urgent
enquiry Canberra should conduct is into
the effectiveness in the field of the stan-
dard infantry weapon—the self-loading
rifle. The reliability of the SLR is being
disputed by the men whose lives depend
on it. In fairness it must be said that
the SLR has been tested throughout the
world and has been proven in climatic
conditions which are not dissimilar to
those of Vietnam those conditions in
Malaysia and Borneo. It is the standard
weapon for the NATO armies and many
millions of rounds have been fired from
it under all climatic conditions. But if
the principle is that the Australian
soldier deserves the best, then the SLR
is clearly inferior to the weapon used by
the American paratroopers the Arme-
lite rifle.
The basis of the complaint is that the
reloading apparatus is not absolutely
reliable: that rapid fire cannot be assured
or relied upon. One ordnance officer
explained that the troops may not 0e
keeping their weapons clean enough. I
dispute this. Any soldier who does not
keep his weapon clean may well be com-
mitting suicide and he knows it. The
fault—it is said—is the propellant in the
"Why aren't your boots falling apart , Hopkins?"
7.2 mm. cartridge. The allegations
against the propellant is that under these
climatic conditions the charge does not
generate enough gas at all times to eject
the spent round and reload. Further-
more, the weapon is heavy and difficult
to fire in certain postures.
Whatever the legitimacy of the com-
plaints about the SLR and it would
appear that the propellant may be
deteriorating under these weather con-
ditions the fact is there does seem to
be a case for the Armelite. Indeed, this
has been recognised by the Department
of Army. Scouts are being issued with
the Armelite.
HThis raises the issue of re-equipping the
battalion completely with the Arme-
lite. The reason for raising this con-
sideration is that the Australian weapon
weighs 10t- pounds, whereas the Armelite
weighs 6i pounds and is 10 inches
smaller. When it is understood that the
weight a man has to carry on his back is
an important, and indeed vital, factor in
jungle warfare, the desirability of the
Armelite is obvious. It has been proven
in Vietnam since 1960 at realistic com-
bat ranges less than a 1000 yards —•
that its accuracy is superior to that of the
SLR. It is lethal at 1000 yards and can
penetrate both sides of the helmet at
500 yards.
Another advantage of the Armelite is
that the round is smaller and lighter. A
scldier can carry twice the ammunition
for an Armelite compared w'ith what he
can carry for the SLR and two hundred
extra rounds for the difference in the
weight of the rifle. An informed source
in ordnance tells me that the fire-power
of a battalion could be doubled if the
American weapon were adopted. Further-
more, its compactness makes it easier to
carry in helicopters.
All soldiers complain. The Australian
troops in Vietnam are complaining less
than most and their beefs are made
cautiously. But equipment deficiencies
and logistical inabilities must be corrected
without delay unless Australia wants to
continue to be dependent upon the
American forces for much of their
supplies, as they are at the moment.
It is said that a soldier is his country’s
best ambassador and that his uniform is
a projection of a national image. The
Digger’s hat is much admired and re-
spected but his uniform has neither
smartness in the street nor practicability
in the field. No one likes to make con-
tinual and unfavorable comparisons with

the Americans, but the Americans have
adopted the uniform which is comfort-
able, tidy and practicable. It is designed
for both combat and off duty. The Aus-
tralian troops admire it because it has
ample pocket space, and is drip-dry, tear-
proof and congenial in conditions alter-
nating between intense rain, high
humidity and burning heat.
Unfavorable comparisons are notori-
ously being made, too, between the Aus-
tralian boot and the American boot. The
Vietcong has evolved a vicious form of
man-trap thousands of needle-sharp,
inch-long bamboo stakes tipped with
human excrement. These stakes
known as pansy stakes can penetrate
with no difficulty the Australian boot.
The American boot, which is light and
comfortable, has a thin layer of steel in
the welt to blunt the pansy stakes and
some models have zips on the side so
that a man can get them on quickly at
night in darkness if he comes under
sniper or mortar fire. Those few seconds
fumbling in the dark over bootlaces can
cost a man his life.
Another piece of extraordinary short-
sightedness is the quality of the material
of the ponchos issued to the men. The
men are refusing to wear the ponchos in
the field—even in blinding and soaking
rain—because they make too much noise.
Noise can cost a man his life in jungle
warfare and troops prefer to lie in their
slit trenches and ambush points soaked
to the skin rather than wear their
ponchos.
A demand clearly exists for a multi-
purpose uniform on the American pattern
for the type of wars that Australia may
have to fight more of those to be
found in South-East Asia.
Complaints about mail delays and
combat allowances have been well
ventilated, but they persist. Complaints
are now beginning to emerge about the
quality of the food. The cooks are un-
questionably as dedicated a group as
you will meet, but they are having to
work with American rations because
Australian , supplies have not been
arranged. The American diet is both
richer and lighter than the Australian
and the troops are complaining in con-
sequence.
But the most unexpected fact I have
discovered is that the Australian Govern-
ment is not prepared to bring Aus-
tralians back home if they get killed.
The Americans ship all their casualties
home. The Australian Government ’s
prepared to ship its dead to the nearest
war cemetery which, in the case of
South-East Asia, is Malacca in Malaysia.
If the relatives of the dead man bring
him home they are responsible for £l5O
air freight charge that it costs to bring
a corpse from Saigon to Sydney.
A comparatively minor complaint-
but an important one for the morale of
the troops —is the nature of the public
relations system in Vietnam. By and
large the Press corps is co-operative and
anxious to do the men justice. But the
Army Public Relations system in Viet-
nam has not always shown itself willing
to co-operate. For example, when a
television team arrived at the base to
photograph and record the unit's band
playing and to interview the Salvation
Army there (hardly matters of deep
security), the team was ordered off the
base on the grounds that the documenta-
tion was not in order. The producer of
the programme, which had cost some
£5OOO, was threatened with arrest if he
entered the battalion headquarters area
to protest to the battalion commander.
The consequence of this brush was a
disenchantment between the team and
the Australian military authorities, which
was unfortunate and did little to protect
the interest of the soldiers.
This conflict between the Army Public
Relations staff and the Press is doubly
unfortunate when it is remembered that
the Americans provide their Press with
most of the requisites of life, from
battery charges and jeeps, helicopter
transportation and uniforms. The basis
of the Army’s distrust of the Press ap-
pears to be the fear that reporters may
reveal prematurely details of forth-
coming military operations. This fear
reveals a lack of maturity and does no
credit whatsoever to the man doing the
fighting.
The men, I repeat, are in great spirits
and are superb in action, but if the Gov-
ernment is to honor these men, a
thorough investigation of the deficiencies
I have mentioned is a matter of the most
urgent national importance.
Vietnam’s Forgotten
Wounded
The army without surgeons
From GAVIN YOUNG in Saigon
South Vietnam’s army is in a crisis
compounded by a particular scandal
of incompetence. It has claimed
'about 1000 casualties a week since May.
In military hospitals too few Viet-
namese surgeons work round the clock
coping with the influx of young soldiers
needing limb amputations. Soon the
soldiers are discharged. What happens
to them then?
In fact, what does not happen to them
would be enough to deter most people
from joining up at all. After years of
war Vietnam has only one rehabilitation
centre for maimed veterans. It is in
Saigon and it is pathetically small. It
can cope, with about 100 men a year.
For the rest, 400 limbless men are per-
manent inmates of three maisons des
invalides, where they receive food and
lodgings and no more.
At the height of the war, despite astro-
nomical sums spent on military opera-
tions, this appears to be the sum of the
Vietnamese effort to bring the country's
shattered frontline defenders back to
something like normal life.
I have spent some time trying to dis-
cover where the responsibility lies for
this situation and what is being done. I
discovered that something may be done
“by the end of this year”, but not nearly
enough. It has been like a tour through
Dickens’s circumlocution office.
It began at Saigon's rehabilitation
centre with one of a few obviously de-
voted men. Colonel Thong studied
medicine at Bordeaux University, is
past retiring age, feels he has a mission
to perform and remains. At his centre
I saw ex-soldiers walking quite expertly
on artificial limbs made by skilled work-
men on the premises.
They have competent nurses and there
is a small operating theatre and clinic.
Patients spend nine months learning a
trade typing, engineering, tailoring.
They get their pension, about £6 a
month, and what they earn from their
work. Finally they are discharged,
found jobs and return to their families.
The centre is admirable —and it is the
only one in Vietnam.
Colonel Thong said: “We need a
whole lot of centres, much larger than
this. I learnt in France that war victims
must not be left to turn into cabbages
in veterans’ homes. They must be taught
to walk, work and return to family life.
“Vietnamese family ties are strong.
Men must not be hidden away from
their families; their minds as well as their
bodies must be kept alive. We have a
number of suicides in the maison cles
invalides; they breed despair.”
What was the Government's attitude?
“Well, two Prime Ministers ago. Premier
Huong agreed that we should have a
very large centre to cope with military
and civilians. But he lost office the
next week.” He waved helpless hands.
“High officials seldom come here. Igo
round from Ministry to Ministry all the
time. I have plans; what we need is
Government action and money.
“It is the Government’s duty, after


all, to repair the wounded. The situa-
tion here is very urgent. In France they
have a Ministry to deal with veterans’
problems; here we have a small depart-
ment.”
In that department, at Minofdef, I
found a friendly senior official who said:
“Well, I am being replaced tomorrow.
I suggest you speak to Colonel Thong,
You’ve met him? Well, he can explain.”
But Thong could do nothing without
Ministerial action, I pointed out.
“True. Perhaps you should talk to
the Americans. Actually, we have re-
commended that ex-soldiers should be
given all the jobs in government depart-
ments they are capable of. The recom-
mendation went to the late Minister.
Now we have a new one.”
What happened to civilian war-
wounded? “That’s another problem.
Ask the people at the Ministry of Social
Affairs.”
At the crumbling Ministry of Social
Affairs a bored Vietnamese official said:
“Civilian war-wounded are the responsi-
bility of national defence. We deal only
with civilians wounded by the Vietcong,”
How many of that category had been
registered? “I have no figures today.”
He smiled at a peeling wall. “Come
back another day.”
I thought I would try the Americans.
After all, neglect of perhaps thousands
of Vietnamese wounded seems to call
for concern at a high level—even at the
Ambassador's level.
The head of the United States Infor-
mation Services pooh-poohed that idea.
“I don’t think that would concern him.”
He read some papers on his desk as he
talked. He had no idea what Americans,
if any, advised the Vietnamese on
veterans’ affairs. “Why don’t you ask
the Vietnamese? You have?”
Inexplicably, he referred the question
to an employee of Voice of America,
who'after two days provided no answer.
A second suggestion led me to a sensible
American major who admires Colonel
Thong and feels the same frustrations.
With an American civilian contractor
who espoused the cause of the Viet-
namese war-wounded off his own bat, the
major has Government approval for a
centre for crippled soldiers at Saigon’s
military hospital. Here they will be fitted
with artificial limbs before discharge.
The major regretted the lack of equip-
ment, buildings and trained personnel.
His project will fill a small gap, but he
thought the US Ambassador should dis-
cuss the whole question with Prime
Minister Ky.
The years go by, but at this crisis
point, when all talk is of “reforming the
army”, neglect of the Vietnamese-soldier,
once he is out of the fight, is both danger-
ous and immoral.
The Big Gunn
A PR creation?
IT was not until the 1960 s that Sir
William Gunn’s PR men made him
a subject for general Press release.
For a decade before then he had been up
to his ears in wool politics. First as presi-
dent of the Graziers’ Federal Council.
Then as chairman of the Australian Wool
Bureau. Then as chairman of the Aus-
tralian Wool Board when it took over the
work of the Bureau and two other wool
com mittees.
Throughout this time, stock pictures
of Gunn’s bluff, cheery face, with its
thick hair parted nearly in the middle
and cut pudding-basin style on the sides,
decorated hundreds of newspaper pieces
on the wool business. But in the 1960 s
we started seeing the whole man (6ft 3in.
and 18 stone of him) in much bigger
pictures illustrating stories of much more
general interest.
The real breakthrough came in 1962
when he posed with a pair of knitting
needles and a ball of wool (“A Purl of
an Idea” said the caption in one news-
paper) and when we began to learn basic
background information such as that,
during his 100-hour working week,
Gunn relaxes by taking off his shoes.
Something was happening that is still un-
usual in Australia. A public figure was
being projected in an American-style
image-building campaign.
The basic image that was being pro-
jected was of no-nonsense Bill, the simple
lad from the bush (with two Queensland
grazing properties totalling 48,000 acres)
who could crutch a sheep with the best
of them but who could also sparkle with
wit at a cocktail party and deal with Big.,
Business, too.
He was projected, of course, as a
“human dynamo” in fact he probably
is with the familiar statistics (the 100-
hour working week. 150,000 air-miles a
year and so forth), the familiar gift,
given to other great men, of going to
sleep at the drop of a stitch, and the fam-
iliar involvement in a number of differ-
ing affairs. (He is on the Commonwealth
Bank Board, the Australian Meat Board
and a director of a number of public
companies. He’s also managing director
of Territory Rice Ltd that runs the ill-
fated Humpty Doo development in the
Northern Territory. When Humpty Doo
flopped in 1959 Gunn took over as.
managing director, having previously
been vice-chairman. He then talked US
multi-millionaire Robert McCulloch into
investing almost £1,000,000 in Humpty
Doo. McCulloch lost most of his money.)
However, the image-building has not
been without its hazards and confusions.
Chief of these is that the image of bluff-,
hearty, down-to-earth Big Bill Gunn

sometimes matches oddly with the image
of chic that is presented in wool pro-
motions.
Thus, shortly after the knitting needles
photo, there was a picture of him with a
pretty model (dressed as an Australian
or American cowgirl) perched on his
shoulder. Gunn was playing his part in
the 1962 “Wild Colonial Line” wool pro-
motion. He was launching the next
season's vogue shades in wool. They in-
eluded Botany Blue, Smoke Haze,
Pioneer Green, Bligh Blue, Musket Grey
and Ned Kelly Green,
A year later, in a pitch directed at
what was described in the handouts as
the “young, moody, arrogant, sexy,
intelligent” generation, he helped launch
wool’s new “Sulky Colors”. “Colors for
being perfectly beastly in,” said the hand-
out, “colors for being pampered in,
colors for being loved like mad in.” The
colors? Moody Blue, Wild Oats, Bold as
Brass, Tickled Pink, Nutty Brown.
There was another confusion in image
when, shortly after launching the “Sulky
Colors”, Gunn spoke to 1300 Victorian
Western Districts woolgrowers in the
Town Hall at Hamilton. When Gunn pro-
duced his PR boys’ graphs supporting
an increase in the wool levy the graziers
pelted the graphs and Gunn with flour
bombs, rotten fruit and emu eggs. They
held aloft strange devices on which were
written “Gestapo Gunn”, “Gunn Should
Go Off” and “Gunn the Commo”.
“Gunn the Commo”? This is another
part of the image. Throughout the ’sixties
Gunn has also been coming through as a
progressively thinking trade-with-China
man. He had talks with Communist Chi-
nese officials in Hong Kong in 1961 and
went to Peking in 1964. (Since all that
impedes an increase in Chinese wool-
buying is the fact that the Chinese haven’t
got enough money some kind of a
credit or barter deal would be needed.
There is no suggestion that the Govern-
ment has given Gunn this kind of auth-
ority.) “Communism never thrives where
there are full bellies,” he said this year.
He was not suggesting that the Chinese
should eat wool: on this occasion he had
come out as an expert on wheat, although
not on Communism.
Y>unning concurrently with the public
* image-building campaign has been the
more privately conducted Gunn-for-Can-
berra movement. It has been a matter of
the right words dropped in the right ears:
Gunn's too good a man to be lost for-
ever on the Wool Board, and so forth.
It reached its conclusion on May 14 when
(while Gunn was in Brussels) it was an-
nounced that he would stand for Country
Party pre-selection in Maranoa.
Back in Sydney in June, he gave a two-
hour Wool Board Press interview at Men-
zies (tape-recorded for a double check).
Yes, he would like to lead the Country
Party. No, he would not become Prime
Minister if it meant leaving the Country
Party. At the end of the interview he was
sitting cross-legged. One reporter noted
that this simple man had a hole in the
sole of one of his shoes.
There is little doubt that Gunn wants
to become deputy leader of the Country
Party as he arrives in Canberra and then
replace John McEwen when he retires.
His ambitions alter that are not known
but one can assume that they are big
time. He's a man who enjoys the big time.
He has only one hurdle before then.
He wants to win a referendum of wool-
growers, to be held soon, on a reserve
price scheme for wool. This referendum
is critical to the future of Australia. And
probably also to the political future of
Sir William Gunn. How he got himself
into this situation is of interest in esti-


mating a man who is so concerned with
obtaining political power.
The story begins with the fascination
that advertising and PR have for Gunn.
This obsession led to events that have
now produced the reserve price scheme.
There is no doubt that Gunn loves adver-
tising. His Wool Board chairmanship has
been marked by a total increase of expen-
diture on promotion from 4/- in 1960
to 44/- now. (There has not been an
equivalent increase in research. Indeed,
the research funds could be endangered
by the reserve price scheme.)
Most of this money is spent in overseas
advertising which has the declared ob-
jective of “creating a quality image for
wool” and keeping it in “the prestige
market”. The theory is that this will push
up the prices for woollen products,
thereby assisting the Australian grower.
Altogether £16,000,000 a year (most of
it from Australia, some from New Zea-
land and South Africa) is going to the
International Wool Secretariat of
which Gunn is also chairman in this
attempt to persuade people all over the
world that wool is good for them, pres-
tige-wise.
The effects of this campaign cannot
yet be estimated. The big spending is
just starting. But it has been noted that
the success of any advertising campaign
is problematic: the wrong campaign can
produce no results, or bad results, and
there are many tasks that advertising
simply cannot achieve.
However, there have already been co-
gent criticisms. One is that Australian
money might have been better spent ad-
vertising the qualities of Australian wool
(which supplies more than half the world
market) instead of wool in general. The
second is that, since some of this money
will be spent subsidising advertising by
some woollen textile makers, it may
simply push up their sales and lower those
of competing woollen textile makers. This
is all right for the manufacturers who
get the subsidy, but it doesn’t sell more
wool.
Paying expenses
Tt was in his two promotion levy cam-
paigns, in 1961 when he wanted to in-
crease the promotion levy from 5/- to
10/- and in 1963 when he began by
asking for an increase to 44/- per
bale, that Gunn developed the techniques
of persuasion that he will now use full
blast in the reserve price referendum.
This is a whistle-stop technique (23
places visited in 1961, 50 in 1963) in
which, accompanied by his PR men
(who slip into country audiences “to
observe reactions”) and using their good
works, he spends Wool Board money in
persuading growers to back his schemes.
When the Hamilton growers threw
things at him, for example, the Wool
Board had to pay not only £5/5/- for
the Town Hall but a cleaners’ bill of
£lO/10/- as well. The cost of his cam-
paign this year on the reserve price
scheme will be £30,000 to £40,000. This
means that Wool Board money is used to
present one side of the case but not the
other. Anyone who opposes Gunn has to
pay his own expenses.
In fact, despite this advantage, it is
doubtful if he would have won the 1963
levy increase if the Government had
not stepped in with a £-for-£ matching
of the increase. The upshot was (still
with some opposition) that the growers
agreed to a 27/- promotion levy. All
told, the Government now puts up
£4,250,000 and the growers £6,750,000
for promotion.
It was during this campaign that the
Wool Board became involved in market-
ing schemes. A group of fundamental-
ists among growers opposed the pro-
motion ideas bitterly and demanded a
reserve price scheme, 1 or some other
marketing scheme, instead. They were
promised a committee of inquiry into
marketing. This committee recommended
something we have never been told
exactly what it did recommend and
as a result the Wool Board came up
with the present reserve price scheme.
There is no doubting Gunn’s sin-
cerity in supporting the reserve price
scheme. But there is no denying that it
appeared to get him off the hook in wool
politics. It seemed a way of keeping his
promotion plans acceptable to the more
rebellious growers.
Of course, there has been a backlash.
Some of the keenest supporters of pro-
motion are now afraid that the reserve
price scheme will not work and that it
might lead to a train of events that could
prove disastrous to the industry. Gunn
wasn’t able, after all, to please everyone
at once.
In simple terms, the scheme is this:
The Federal Government would set up
a wool marketing authority. This auth-
ority would set a minimum price for each
grade of wool. If this price was not met
the authority would buy the wool and not
sell it until the market bids up to the
reserve price. £30,000,000 of the
£80,000,000 that is estimated as necessary
for the scheme would come from a
growers’ levy of at least 17/4 per bale
over seven years. The other £50,000,000
would come from general tax funds.
It may sound a simple and unobjection-
able scheme. There is one main criticism
of it. It is not likely to work.
If it is not needed, that is to say, if
wool prices stay above the reserve prices,
it simply adds to woolgrowers’ expenses.
For various reasons, coming from the
subtleties of the wool market, the scheme
is not likely to reduce fluctuations in
price. It may actually increase them.
But the most serious prospect is this:
The building-up of stockpiles is likely to
depress the market. Demand would go
down as manufacturers turned even more
than now to synthetics. The stockpiles
would grow and the cost of supporting
them would threaten funds used for pro-
motion and research.
If this happened the scheme would
break down. There would then be pres-
sures for straight-out acquisition and
subsidy. And as a prominent woolgrower
said two years ago, “I hate to contem-
plate the consequences if the Australian
community had to subsidise the wool in-
dustry.” The speaker „was Sir William
Gunn. (Two years before then he had
told a meeting of Victorian woolgrowers:
“As chairman of the Australian Wool
Board I could not take sides on a reserve
price marketing plan.”)
“Incredulous amazement”
A re a majority of Australia’s 110,000
growers going to vote for the scheme
when a referendum is held in the wool
industry, probably in September? One
group will certainly support it. This in-
cludes the group that opposed the pro-
motion scheme and it includes some who
welcome the Reserve Price Scheme be-
cause they do not believe it will work
and will therefore lead to a straight-out
acquisition scheme, which they want.
Another group will oppose it. Some
of them have formed a campaign com-
mittee and at their own expense they
will try to counteract the £30,000 or
£40,000 campaign Gunn is mounting.
The main group have not made up
their minds.
As a campaign begins that is not only
important to Gunn’s political future, but
to the economic future of Australia,
Gunn has proved somewhat evasive, dis-
ingenuous and even snappish.
The arguments he puts up in support
of the scheme are sketchy when com-
pared with the detailed criticisms of the
scheme made by the Philp Commission
two years before and by other investi-
gating bodies over the last 15 years. In-
deed, there is no evidence that as much
research and argument has gone into
making the Wool Board’s decision as
has gone into the making of these
criticisms against it.
And it was at the very least disingenu-
ous for him to claim that British and
Italian manufacturers pressed him to put
in the scheme. This extraordinary claim
was repudiated by the trade as soon as
he made it, with what “The Wool Re-
cord” described as a “gasp of incredulous
amazement”.
It is surprising to find in a wool'man
that he should adopt PR policies that are
somewhat synthetic.

Hollywood, 1965
As the stars die off, a massive industrial revival
By CHARLES HIGHAM
At the Church of the Recessional in
Forest Lawn, the 100-odd mourn-
ers sat almost motionless while
Cary Grant and George Cukor
read eulogies and Katharine Hepburn,
sternly, delivered Kipling's “If”. Out-
side, the black sky spat ram; inside, the
Who’s Who of Hollywood pallbearers,
selected by the dead man’s widow, Jen-
nifer Jones-Joseph Cotten, George
Cukor, Sam Goldwyn, Alfred Hitch-
cock, Christopher Isherwood, Louis Jour-
dan, Lewis Milestone, Sam Spiegel,
William Wellman and William Wyler
among them sent the body royally off
to its resting-place.
At the end of the simple and moving
Jewish service, one felt that yet another
vestige of a vanishing Hollywood had
disappeared. David O. Selznick took with
him perhaps the final hope of a revival
of the old-time “quality” Hollywood pro-
duction: the film which probably' from
a time-honored literary origin, star-
ring actors already renowned on the
stage, written with literacy and wit—
would nlensp thp hankers the mass audi-
ence and‘ the critics alike. Today, the
kind of big-budget picture which Selz-
nick promoted in the 1930 s and 1940 s
is likely to be replaced by something
much more broad, colorful, and boister-
ous; and, indeed, while I stayed in Holly-
wood last month, three of the new-style
blockbusters Warner’s “The Great
Race,” 20th-Fox’s “Those Magnificent
Men in their Flying Machines,” and
United Artists’ “The Hallelujah Trail”
—■ were launched with splendid confi-
dence at premieres recalling the golden
years of a decade or more back.
Confidence is, in fact, the keynote of a
Hollywood startlingly regenerated in the
period since my last visit there in 1962
xhen the studios were ghostly no-man’s-

jncT on the back i ot a stray wr i ter or

the M arienbad hotel through desolate
corridorS; and an air among the few
survivors of dark and disma i prophecy.
Today, a thoroughly workable policy of
mounting huge entertainments with far-
flung locations, opulent sets and color,
and Tories full of fast action and racy
dialogue, has proven more successful
than even the most optimistic dared hope.
Paramount has lavishly repainted its once
shabby buildings and refurnished many
of its offices in that Hollywood style so
constant throughout the studios it might
have sprung from the same designer.
pastel, faded colors, beige and cream
settees, carpets and walls, and the fre-
quent glint of gold-thread. Warner shot a
half-million dollar bankroll on its biggest
party in years; for more than a thou-
sand Pressmen (many of them flown
there from all over the world), celebrities
and directors and writers, to launch “The
Great Race .
M-G-M proudly announced almost
a score of new productions as you drove
in the gate. United Artists declared a
multi-million dollar budget for James
Michener’s “Hawaii”, now shooting in
Oahu with Julie Andrews and Max von
Sydow. Universal continues with its mag-
nificent city development project, and—*
under the aegis of its owners, MCA
to boast a massive list of television pro-
ductions. The Fox administration build-
is crammed from end to end with

all workln ß ln conditions of splendid
opulence surrounded in many cases by
P™ ud dis Pl a ys °{ trophies: Oscars, fram-
ed medals, certificates of the Chevalier
de Legion D Honneur, and Golden Globe
awards.
Unlike most places, Hollywood flaunts
its worst areas at the tourist and hides
its magnificence away. The immediate
impressions of the suburb of Hollywood
itself are shockingly depressing. Along
Hollywood Boulevard —in an act of
sublime silliness by the local authorities
pink coral and bronze stars have been
let into the paving-stones, containing
symbols of movie-making, cameras or
other impedimenta, and the names of
performers going right back to the start
of the silent period. Each morning, you
walk over forgotten names: Jean Muir,
Monte Blue, Marguerite Chapman, Mar-
garet Lindsay, Toby Wing, Estelle Tay-
lor, Art Acord . . . they stretch away to
infinity, seedy relics of eras of film-
making which everyone in Hollywood has
already put on the shell. This isn t a
town which honors its past, and already
plans for a Hollywood Museum have
foundered . . .
Over the pink stars, sad, pale and
shabby people mostly middle-aged or
old slouch past in shapeless woollen
suits, and those peculiar American shoes


which look like squashed licorice. The
women often wear curlers in their hair,
not even bothering to put on a scarf d la
Bondi Junction. The few young men
hanging around the street corners at
night or mincing across the intersections
in white jeans are male prostitutes, cal-
ling out their wares to single men in
passing cars. Almost all the buildings are
one-storied, slovenly looking shops or
cafes which, on billboards 16 feet high,
proclaim the food to be had within:
STEAK ’N’ TATER DOLLAR NINETY
FIVE, PIE A LA MODE, MUFFINS
ALL YOU CAN EAT ... As dusk falls,
electric light signs flicker eerily, pale
green or sickly pink. Over the crammed
car-parks, giant palm trees droop their
shabby leaves in the rain or white pep-
pering of smog.
Even the facade of the Brown Derby
in Vine Street, expensive rendezvous of
the Press agents and the stars, has the
grubby whiteness of an unwashed face.
Very occasionally a bus rolls past, tin-
nier than its Sydney counterpart, full of
Negro janitors and maids and Spanish or
Japanese gardeners.
Caddies and Chevs
A lmost everyone else drives mam-
moth Caddies and Chevs which, ac-
cording to their owners, are going to fall
to pieces in a year or so. Each afternoon
from the hotels, though, after a coffee-
shop lunch of unspecified soup du jour,
hunks of beef smothered in an antisep-
tic sauce, shreds of lettuce buried under
a toothpaste-colored dressing and a
crumpled-looking pie out of the fridge,
the tourists set out disconsolately from
the hotels on their afternoon bus tours
of Dreamland: to, most likely, the long
journey round Beverly Hills area, where
the stars’ homes maps to which are
sold, 20 years out of date and dog-eared,
by boys and old ladies along the way
are pointed out through a loudspeaker
and, if you are lucky, you can actually
see Loretta Young taking out the dog.
Beverly Hills: surprisingly, it turns out
to be, not a suburb, as most books des-
cribe it, but a separate city of 35,000
people, with its own government, mayor
and councilmen. It began to be fashion-
able for movie people when Douglas Fair-
banks and Mary Pickford bought Pick-
fair in 1919 and turned the house into
a showplace which still I spent an
agreeable afternoon there retains the
air of patrician elegance and charm it
must have had when the Mountbattens
spent their honeymoon in it in the
’twenties. Not far away, Harold Lloyd’s
estate, object of another of my pilgrim-
ages, boasts 18 acres of priceless territory
in the middle of Coldwater Canyon,
flocks of servants including two men
to look after the potted plants and
splendid garden walks which would do
justice to the palace of a Renaissance
Pope. Vincent Price’s mansion cram-
med with innumerable objets d'art
ranging from Hopi Indian tiles to statues
that dwarf the visitor in the living-room,
from tiny pre-Columbian figures to a
totem-pole 70 foot high (said to have
been stolen by John Barrymore from an
Alaskan tribe) has an impact so over-
powering as to exhaust the visitor within
10 minutes of setting foot in the door.
And in an area where property ranges
100,000 dollars for a modest cottage
to 400,000 dollars for a medium-sized
villa, I visited many other enjoyable
houses. Agnes Moorehead’s delicately
bizarre reworking of Sigmund Rom-
berg’s old home; Bette Davis’ New Eng-
land farmhouse in Bel Air, with sporting
prints on the walls, discreet wooden
panelling and, outside, the splendid in-
congruity of swimming-pool and Cali-
fornian lawn; Joseph Cotten’s beach-
side villa with hundreds of Convnedia
dell’arte figures and a chandeliered music-
room converted into an indoor, sunken
pool; and the director Delmer Daves'
house, filled with evidence of his aston-
ishing energy and range of interests:
scores of meteorite fragments, precious
and semi-precious stones, special type-
faces, files of hundreds upon hundreds
of photographs and clippings on an in-
finity of subjects, dictionaries in a dozen
languages laced with his own spidery
philological annotations, 55 volumes of
his essays, examples of rare metals . . .
The environs in which these treasure-
houses stand Bel Air, Beverly Hills,
Glendale and the rest are in fact
gigantic and elegantly beautiful parks in
which the individual homes often have
actually been placed by supervisory
keepers. The roads are immaculately
clean, winding away to the hills through
symmetrical plantings of palm trees or
eucalyptus. From each side of the road,
past the spotless kerbs, a strip of lawn is
followed by a white path, then another
strip of lawn or ivy-planted soil which
rolls, as likely as not, up a small mound
to the house. The styles are enormously
varied from English Tudor all the way
to Mortician Modern—but a note of vul-
garity or confusion seldom sets in.
One feels even a brisk breeze would
be insufferably insulting to this perfect
world snatched out of nature: contrary
to rumor and Irving Wallace, these are
among the most discreet and civilised
suburbs in the world, and perhaps con-
tain as well as the greatest concen-
tration of wealth the greatest concen-
tration of privately owned art-treasures
as well. Only the lack of the sound of
laughter, of dogs barking and children
running, of all the noises one is used to
in a Sydney suburb, occasionally make
one wonder if the area is inhabited after
all.
The sense of opulence conveyed here
continues at the studios where so many
of the owners of the great houses work.
The offices are frequently designed by art
directors in that pallid Californian luxury
style familiar in color movies set the way
from Anchorage to Zanzibar. And of all
the studios, the most impressive is Uni-
versal, for so many years the home of
horror pictures and cheap westerns but
now the thriving centre of a vast industrial
complex, including a bank, a real estate
development, a hotel now building, and
the largest backlot in Hollywood, stretch-
ing over hundreds of acres to the bleak
hills above Lankershim Boulevard. Each
day the candy-striped tourist trams slide
past —the streets representing Rome,
Paris or London, or the sinister little hill
on which stands the “Psycho” motel.
And in the centre of this world stands the
grandly brooding black spandulite and

(There is a charming rumor around
Hollywood that the walls, mounted on
coasters, are moved frequently at night
when the offices are deserted; in if you
are out of favor, out if you are in .. .
find yourself one morning in something
resembling a telephone booth, and you
can start looking in the want ads . . .
"You’re never so out as when they're in”
is the saying around Hollywood.)
Country clubs
T?ox, Paramount, Columbia and Metro
are the cream-and-beige country
clubs, calmly sunlit and full of bustling,
tanned men in short-sleeved shirts.
United Artists, which leases offices in the
Goldwyn studios and the Disney studios,
have a less kempt look but, ironically, are
among the most successful of the Holly-
wood organisations. And the big pictures
are keeping them all going: MGM’s “The
Yellow Rolls-Royce” broke all records in
its first weeks at the Radio City Music
Hall; Fox’s "Flying Machines” broke
records for a Broadway first release, and
“My Fair Lady”, “The Sound of Music”,
“The Greatest Story Ever Told” and
“Mary Poppins” are all ‘doing superb
business.
Yet behind the luxury and the con-
fidence, Hollywood is gripped by quite a
few fears, doubts and regrets. The
demand for greater and greater size
and the steady disappearance of the stars
into death or old age -is causing some
of the great figures of Hollywood to
agonise about two things: how to be sure
that a multi-million dollar investment is
going to work, and whether it is worth
paying the few remaining big stars any-

thing up to a million dollars and more to
appear in them.
George Cukor, brilliant and cultivated
director of some of the screen’s best
comedies and musicals, ranging from
“The Royal Family of Broadway”
through “The Philadelphia Story” and “A
Star Is Born” to “My Fair Lady”, re-
gretted the upsurge of critical enthusiasm
for ugliness and madness in the cinema,
and wants to see a return to the kind of
elegance and beauty exemplified by the
cinema of, say, David Selznick.
Joseph Cotten told me he regretted the
loss of the old-fashioned romantic love-
story, the kind of thing he appeared in
at Paramount in the late 19405. Bette
Davis shared his feeling, and felt that
the genre, though critically crucified,
contained much material of quality. Del-
mer Daves blamed the loss of “quality”
film-making in Hollywood on the split
between the East Coast bankers and the
West Coast creators. All looked back
bitterly to the Government move which,
more than a decade ago, broke up the
monopoly whereby the studios owned
their own theatres, a move which —more
than anything else —helped to destroy
the good, medium-budget picture which
went out along fixed distribution lines to
a ready and waiting audience. This nos-
talgia for the past is reflected in the ob-
session with re-makes (Ross Hunter at
Universal, perhaps the most brilliantly
successful of the younger producers, has
just finished a new version of “Madame
X” and plans to recreate the old Merle
Oberon weepie “Dark Angel”, and re-
makes of “Beau Geste”, “Stagecoach”
and “Alice in Wonderland” are being
proposed) and with full-scale re-creations
of Hollywood's salad days (the two rival
versions of “Harlow”). Most of the
people I spoke to bemoaned the fact that
the agencies had so forced up the price of
the stars under contract to them that they
had increased the budgets to dangerously
high points, and might eventually wreck
the star system itself—by pricing their
clients out of the market. And there was
talk everywhere about the shortage of
new stars.
Wasn’t he (1 asked Ross Hunter) wor-
ried about the rapid ageing of the few
stars left, the fact that Lana Turner,
whom he has cast in the lead as “Madame
X”, was, in her mid-forties, among the
youngest of the stars? “Yes, I tell you
my next picture is going to be called
‘Menopause Love’ . . . and the one after
that 'The Rocking Chair’ . . . and the
one after that ‘The Wheel Chair’.” Hedda
Hopper, doyenne of Hollywood colum-
nists, told me she could think of no stars
of interest under, say, 40. In 10 years’
time, one couldn't help recalling, Cary
Grant would be around 72, James Stew-
art about 67, Doris Day and Lana Turner
in their fifties, Joan Crawford and Bette
Davis in their late sixties. Somehow, it
was impossible to look forward to the
blossoming in their forties of people like
Troy Donahue, Natalie Wood and Tues-
day Weld.
With the vanishing of the great pro-
ducts of a rapidly vanishing star system,
the low or medium budget film genre
which produced most of the best Holly-
wood films, movies like “Crossfire” and
“The Set-Up” and “The Maltese Falcon”,
has gone into oblivion. Only on tele-
vision, and that infrequently, have experi-
mentalism and fresh ideas been possible
in the last few years, and 1 met some of
the first-class men behind those scenes:
Joseph Stefano, giftefd author of the
“Psycho" screenplay and producer of the
uneven but frequently inventive and
striking “Outer Limits” series, and his
talented colleague Gerd Oswald; William
Frye, the genius who created the “Thril-
ler” series, perhaps the most impressive
venture into the Gothic mode that either
cinema or television has ever achieved.
Shifts of power
I>oth series have been killed off through
the stupidity of the TV bosses and the
intolerable juggling of network timeslots;
and a brilliant new series, “The Haunted”,
planned by Joseph Stefano (he showed
me the pilot, a masterpiece of the
macabre, at his home) has been ditched
because of the James Aubrey dismissal
and other shifts of power at CBS. Ste-
fano, Oswald and Frye seemed to me the
only really creative men. the only artists
I met in Hollywood; whether they can
artistically survive in an increasingly mas-
sive and monolithic industry remains to
be seen.
Like American publishing, the movie
business has less and less room for the
idiosyncratic, personal work of genius as
time goes on; the sheer size of the market
that has to be appealed to crushes almost
all except those who know how to manu-
facture large-scale entertainment for the
masses. And even the best directors
men like Wyler, Cukor and Leßoy
tend to dismiss their past work, no matter
what its quality, if it has failed to make
money.
Hollywood is quite simply a
massive industrial plant, kept going
largely by men of limitless technical skill
and knowledge who earn a larger aggre-
gate of cash than workers in other in-
dustrial plants anywhere in the world. In
the future, the only alternative to the
machine-tooled product the industry can
produce is likely to be the occasional film
of quality produced by the handful of
directors who have survived the system
with the right to make their pictures as
they please (notably Wyler, Cukor and
John Frankenheimer). And, perhaps,
films made for Pay-TV.
Samuel Goldwyn and others told me
they expect Pay-TV to come in in five
years, Mervyn Leßoy said he believed
the reason it had failed so far was that
it had been backed with a “mere” 22
million dollars; it should be backed with
150 million, and by the industry as a
whole. If Pay-TV does come in and suc-
ceeds, a picture will be able to recover
its costs within 24 hours. Then, we may
possibly get back the mass production
schedules which disappeared with the rise
of TV in the ’forties; we may even get the
large number of quality films, done
modestly but with a maximum of talent,
which make the release lists for a year
like, say, 1941, so sharply poignant to-
day.
A month in Hollywood has convinced
me that the resources of talent in those
leafy back streets are still there, that all
the place needs is a guaranteed market to
produce a sizeable number of first-class
movies once more. Pay-TV may provide
that market. One hopes it will.


C.S.R. Co's ANNUAL REPORT
Points from Chairman's address
to shareholders
In his annual address to shareholders, the Chairman of The Colonial Sugar Refining
Company Limited, Mr. J. W. Dunlop, referred to:
© Raw sugar production at the company's mills was a record but below expectations,
n d disappointing.
© There are no indications of any large recovery in the world price of raw sugar.
© Refined sugar sales improved in Australia but declined somewhat in New Zealand.
C Sales of building materials and industrial chemicals increased.
The C.S.R. Company’s profit for the year was earned from widespread activities in raw and
refined stwar, building materials, industrial chem cals, ocean ships, distillery products, quarrying
and ready mixed Concrete, from services and from investments in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand.
Some points made by Mr. Dunlop were:

(estimated)
C.S.R.'s Australian Mills: The 1964 harvesting
and milling season at the company’s mills in
Queensland was prolonged and difficult, due to
adverse weather conditions. By contrast, fav-
ourable conditions prevailed in New South
Wales.
Much additional plant has been installed at
the company’s mills in both States during the
past year to meet the expanded production
objectives.
Fiji
South Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd.: Prolonged
dry weather during much of the 1964 crushing
season held output down to 308,000 tons of raw
sugar. This was the most sugar so far made'
in one season in Fiji.
The capacities of transport and milling
plants and sugar stores have been further
increased.
During the past twm years, 1300 new cane
growers have entered the industry and the
contract areas of many established farms have
been increased.
The training of tradesmen continues actively,
under special tutors, and more than 70 appren-
tices were studying overseas correspondence
courses at the start of 1965. During this year,
22 of the apprentices will become qualified as
tradesmen.
Other Fiji Matters: South Pacific Sugar Mills
Ltd. was converted to a public company last
year and local people W'ere invited to buy
shares. More than 1700 Fiji residents are now
shareholders in South Pacific Sugar Mills Ltd.
A housing project is being developed at Lau-
toka, in co-operation with the Fiji Housing
Authority, to provide home ownership oppor-
tunities for employees at Lautoka Mill.
Further secondary school scholarships have
been aw'arded by South Pacific Sugar Mills
Ltd. and about 100 children are receiving this
assistance.
REFINED SUGAR
Australia: Sales of sugar products from our
five Australian refineries for the year ended
31st March 1965 were 576,000 tons, up 4% on
the previous year.
C.S.R. packaged sugar continues to be well
received by the grocery trade and by house-
wives and sales are steadily rising.
We are further developing our services to
industrial customers, particularly in the de-
livery and handling of bulk sugars.
New Zealand: Sales of sugar products by the
New Zealand Sugar Co. Ltd. for the year
ended 31st March 1965 were 112,000 tons, a
reduction of 5% on the previous year’s sales.
High prices and speculation about possiole
price changes depressed sales.
SUGAR INDUSTRY MATTERS
Australian Raw Sugar Production: Australia’s
34 raw sugar mills (seven of them owned by
C.S.R.) made 1,904,000 tons in the 1964 season.
Although this tonnage was a record, it would
have been more but for unfavourable weather.
Unfavourable weather conditions have occur-
red again, and present estimates are that
output from the 1965 season will not exceed
2,000,000 tons.
These set-backs to production in both 1964
and 196 a have restricted our ability to take
full advantage of the export marketing oppor-
tunities which had opened up.
Quality of Australian Export Raw Sugar:
Much attention has been devoted for some
years to maintaining and improving the qual-
ity of Australian raw sugar. It is essentM
raw sugar should at all times be of high
quality and positive action has been taken to
ensure tliat it will be.
World Sugar Situation: In the past year the
world free market price fell steadily from
about £Stg.46 per ton c.i.f. U.K. to a low of
£Stg.2l in February before staging a mild
recovery to about £Stg.26 in March. Since then
there has been a further steady decline to
£Stg.2o as this report goes to the printer.
Extreme fluctuation in the world price of
sugar is a well-known phenomenon and is a
matter of great concern to both exporters and
importers. It is of especial concern to Aus-
tralia and Fiji. For the 1964 season, 49% of
Australian sugar and 45% of Fijian were sold
at prices related to the world free market price.
International Sugar Agreement: There is a
movement towards a new International Sugar
Agreement.
Australia supports the principle of inter-
national commodity agreements, and the Aus-
tralian sugar industry has actively upheld past
International Sugar Agreements. There are,
however, many difficult problems to be over-
come and protracted negotiations may be
necessary before a satisfactory agreement
emerges.
British Commonwealth Sugar Agreement:
At the annual conference in London at the
end of last year, the most far-reaching
changes since its inception were introduced
into the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.
Three new exporting countries came into the
agreement.
Negotiated price quotas were increased. Aus-
tralia’s quota was raised from 330,000 tons to
335,000 tons, and Fiji’s from 132,000 to 140,000
tons. These quotas have now been fixed and
are no longer subject to slight movements in
response to changes in U.K. consumption.
Fiji and the other “less developed” members
of the agreement received an additional
£5tg.3.5.0 per ton of negotiated price sugar in
recognition of the difficulties caused by the
present depressed prices received for their
free market sales.
United States Market: The foreign quota pro-
visions of the U.S. Sugar Act expired at the
end of 1964, and new legislation to replace
them was not introduced. As an interim mea-
sure, the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture has
made quota allocations for foreign supplies for
1965 on the basis of export performance in
1963 and 1964. These arrangements have re-
sulted in quotas corresponding to about 165,000
long tons for Australia and 40,000 long tons
for Fiji.
Japan: Japanese buyers have recently con-
tracted to take a record total of 550,000 tons
from Australia from the 1965 season. From the
1964 season Japan purchased 477,000 tons.
Malaysia: Malaysia’s first sugar refinery com-
menced operations in August 1964. Both Austra-
lia and Fiji have become established as major
suppliers of raw sugar to the new refinery.
BUILDING MATERIALS
There has been more building activity in
Australia during the last year than ever before
and sales of C.S.R. building materials have
risen accordingly.
Fibreboard Group: Domestic sales of Mason-
ite and Timbrock hardboards were greater,
and export sales substantially greater, than in
the previous year.
C.S.R. Floor Tiles: The vinyl flooring market
continues to grow, but competition from within
Australia and from imports is severe.
Pyneboard: Pyneboard Pty. Ltd. and Pyne-
board (Gippsland) Pty. Ltd. are now both
owned equally by Australian Paper Manufac-
turers Ltd. and C.S.R. Sales improved sub-
stantially on the previous year.
Gypsum Products: There is a strong demand
for Gyprock which we expect will continue.
Bradford Insulation (85% C.S.R.): Sales of all
8.1. companies are being well maintained
against keen competition.
Australian Blue Asbestos Pty. Ltd.: Sales of
blue asbestos improved during the year as the
market became more normal.
INDUSTRIAL CHEMICALS
C.S.R. Chemicals Pty. Ltd. (60% C.S.R.): Sales
of plastics and industrial chemicals by C.S.R.
Chemicals and associated companies increased,
but are now showing signs of levelling off.
READY MIXED CONCRETE LTD.
The R.M.C. group of companies, in which
C.S.R. acquired a 50% interest, has continued
to operate satisfactorily.
MT. NEWMAN IRON ORE PROJECT
The Australian equity in this joint operation
with American Metal Climax Inc. has been
increased from 45% to 50%.
A contract for the sale of 100 million tons of
iron ore was concluded with eight Japanese
steel mills in May. Shipments are to begin in
1969 and will build up to at least 5 million
tons a year by 1973.
ACCOUNTS AND FINANCES
There are no indications at present of any
large recovery in world sugar prices and we
expect therefore that the average price to the
mills will be lower than for the year under
review. Under these conditions consolidated
profit for tire 1966 year is not likely to be as
much as in the year just concluded. csr6 7b


The Cairns Line
on Vietnam
A campaign of evasive obfuscation
By GEOFFREY FAIRBAIRN
Easily the most vocal, consistent, and
formidable opponent in Australia
of the US-Australian involvement
of Vietnam is Dr J. F. Cairns. His
strength has lain in the endless reiteration
of argument to the effect that the guer-
rilla war in South Vietnam is simply and
only a Southern response to economic
and political conditions: the Northern
Government in Hanoi had nothing much
at all to do with this apparently spon-
taneous outbreak until the wicked
Americans forced its hand; certainly had
nothing to do with the formation or con-
trol of the Southern Liberation Front.
Such is his argument.
And the argument about South Viet-
nam is based upon a very special thesis
about modern history. It deserves ex-
amination. It is to be found in a type-
script, “The Truth About Vietnam”,
bearing his name and his signature, a
copy of which was accidentally left
presumably by a Labor MP lying
around in Parliament House at the end
of April this year. Mr Tom Hughes,
MP, and Mr James Killen, MP, both
referred to it in the House without evok-
ing any denial of its authorship. I have
compared it with Dr Cairns’s more pub-
lic contribution to the present debate on
Vietnam, an article in “Living With
Asia” (Australian Institute of Inter-
national Affairs, Sydney, 1963) and the
comparison suggests the same authorship
most convincingly, in point of style, sel-
ective quotations from some of the same
few books consulted, and general argu-
ment. And so I am assuming, quite rea-
sonably, I believe, that the typescript
thesis I shall be examining here is the
work of Dr J. F. Cairns.
What is the core of his thesis? It is
that even in Europe after World War 11,
advance, as distinct from
Nazi advance, depended upon economic
and political conditions . . . Communist
‘invasion’, and then it would mainly be
Communists of the country concerned,
depends upon economic and political
conditions of the country concerned.”
There is no mention of the Red Army’s
conquest of Eastern Europe at all. Those
small groups of Moscow-exiled Com-
munists who were placed in power
throughout the countries of Eastern
Europe at the point of Soviet bayonets
were, according to Dr Cairns, merely a
response to “economic and political con-
ditions”. According to Dr Cairns, the
bulk of the Red Army were “mainly the
Communists of the countries concerned”.
This very special interpretation of his-
tory, this travesty of the truth, is being
offered up by a former university lec-
turer.
But it is essential this outright fal-
sification of history—to Dr Cairns’s
whole thesis. He goes on to say: “The
strategy of international Communism is
not war. It is revolution. (Sic) It is not
to strike irrespective of the conditions.
It always has been.” It seems that at this
point Dr Cairns’s control both of his
typewriter and his grammar gave way
under the strain of trying to put into
English such a preposterous statement.
But its meaning, upon reflection, is clear
enough: Communists never strike*irres-
pective of the conditions. Now this is
either tautological or blatantly untrue.
One must assume that Dr Cairns is try-
ing to say that Communists never strike
unless conditions are socially compelling
and politically conducive to victory.
Quite clearly this is demonstrably un-
true. The ghosts of Rosa Luxembourg
and Karl Liebknecht and Bela Kuhn —
and the Vietnamese of the Nghe-An
Soviet who rose against the French on
September 22, 1930, for that matter
must be laughing wryly in the shades
somewhere at such claptrap. But to
come much closer to our own time:
in 1948 a Communist meeting in Cal-
cutta saw the presentation of a thesis,
stemming from Zhdanov’s starting of
“the Cold War” in Europe, to the effect
that armed struggle was the proper form
of struggle in S.E. Asia. It was accepted
and acted upon by the Communist Par-
ties of Burma, India (in the Telengana
district of Hyderabad), Malaya, and In-
donesia. Interestingly, Mr Lance Shark-
ey, then Secretary-General of the Aus-
tralian Communist Party, who not only
attended the Calcutta Conference, but
stopped in Singapore to have discussions
with Mr Lee Soong of the Malayan Com-
munist Party shortly before the MCP
terrorist campaign began, argued exactly
as Dr Cairns argues in his thesis. Mr
Sharkey's words were, “Wars of National
independence cannot be conjured up by
‘instructions’ from anyone but arise out
of existing conditions.” (According to a
man who left the Australian Communist
Party, Mr Cecil Sharpley, Mr Sharkey
DR J. F. CAIRNS
informed the National Congress of the
Australian Communist Party that he was
commissioned by the Cominform rep-
resentatives in Calcutta to convey the
decisions to the MCP. But that is by the
by.
Well, what happened to these Com-
munist “responses to political and eco-
nomic conditions”? They were all crush-
ed; quickly and dramatically by the
Silawangi Division in Indonesia; slowly
and imperfectly in Burma; effectively in
India; and after a huge effort, in Malaya.
Presumably, conditions were not right.
In this case, what do Mr Sharkey and
Dr Cairns mean when they argue that
Communists never strike according to
instructions, nor irrespective of condi-
tions? Surely the implications of this
shared argument are perfectly clear: by
definition, if one takes a special view of
history, there cannot be outside inter-
ference from or control by Communists.
The facts say otherwise; but ideologists
(whether Communists or non-Communist
Leftists) are untroubled by facts; they
are concerned so to deform the ordinary
commerce between human beings that
the facts cannot be understood and so
the bogus arguments cannot be under-
mined. But the facts will out in a free
society, which is why such ideologists
have despotism on the brain.
Now, having “proved” by definition
that Communism can never advance
through war but only through revolution,
which is of course only a response to
“political and economic conditions”, Dr
Cairns begins to get careless with his
political language: a “revolutionary war”
appears, part of a continuing process that
began against the French, which “the
Communists, of course, support” because
they are “nationalists”. It is all very con-
fusing. Perhaps it is meant to be: that
master of guerrilla warfare, T. E. Law-


rence, once said that a guerrilla move-
ment should be like “a cloud, or vapor-
ous gas” and Dr Cairns is quite clearly
trying to manipulate the minds of his
colleagues by the old tactic of creating
confusion of a kind that can only be dis-
pelled by the simplistic thesis underlying
it.
But it is not wholly confusing. Dr
Cairns writes of “the revolutionary
forces in the South”, which in the con-
text clearly denotes Communist Viet-
minh cadres controlled by the North.
These poor fellows, it seems, at first
held their peace “because they may have
believed they could win an election if
one were held, or they may not have
been strong enough to recommence a
campaign.” That they eventually took
up arms is attributed to Diem’s failure
to hold an election, his “witch-hunting,
religious intolerance and arbitary ar-
rests”, or (this an undocumented quota-
tion from a Frenchman whose name
seems to have been misspelt) because
before emergency legislation came into
force: “The Communists were quiescent;
but when they felt hands closing around
their throats, they proceeded to counter-
attack.”
And so we have southerner cadres of
the Vietminh (a movement controlled by
the Vietnamese Laodong Communist
Party in the North) deciding in 1960 to
call “upon all patriots to take up revolu-
tionary action and asking a reluctant
North to help them. Dr Cairns, who is so
assiduous in demanding evidence from
his opponents about the clandestine, para-
military Vietminh (Vietcong), here ad-
duces as sole supporting evidence a foot-
note relating to 1964.
At the end of 1960 the political arm
of the movement in the South was form-
ed; and according to Dr Cairns this
National Liberation Front was not even
“completely favorable to the North.” In
actual documented fact what happened
was this: on September 5, 1960, the
political report of the Central Commit-
tee of the Laodong (Communist) Party
in Hanoi stated: “The socialist revolu-
tion is carried out in the North while
in the South we have to make every
effort to achieve a broad national unity
embracing all the national and demo-
cratic forces, all forces opposed to the
US imperialists and Ngo Dinh Diem.”
Not “they” in the South; but “us”
directors in the North.
A captured Vietcong (i.e., Vietnamese
Communist) document, extracts from
which are published in the State Depart-
ment’s “Aggression from the North”, con-
tains the following about the Communist
People’s Revolutionary Party which con-
trols the National Liberation Front: “To
deceive the enemy, it is necessary that
the new party be given the outward ap-
pearance corresponding to a division of
the party (all-Vietnamese Laodong Com-
munist Party) into two and the founda-
tion of a new party, so that the enemy
cannot use it in his propaganda.” In
another captured document: “The
People’s Revolutionary Party has only the
appearance of an independent existence;
actually, our party is nothing but the
Laodong Party of Viet-Nam.” The whole
of Vietnam.
The evidence of Northern control—
Laodong control—of the National Lib-
eration Front is indisputable; and Dr
Cairns has read it, as he has often point-
ed out. Why does he evade the evi-
dence and retreat into a posture of lead-
en repetition of an untenable thesis when
he is not obscuring the issues? Even the
Australian Communist Wilfred Bur-
chett, a long-time mouthpiece of the
Communist regime, writes, “Within the
(National Liberation) Front is the
Marxist, People’s Revolutionary Party,
a party with the inherited prestige of
the party formed and headed by Ho Chi-
minh and acquired prestige because of
the preponderant role PRP members
play in military activities.” There is only
one party he is referring to as founded
by Ho Chi-minh: the Communist Party
of Indo-China which in 1945, for tacti-
cal reasons, was changed to the Com-
munist Party of Vietnam the whole of
Vietnam. [lndeed, the Communist Pathct
Lao, too, is controlled by men holding
secret membership of the all-Vietnam
(really all-lndo-China) Communist Party;
as is the case with the Overseas Vietnam-
ese Association along the Thai bank of
the Mekong, now preparing to “respond
to political and economic conditions” in
north-east Thailand; and as is the case
with the Cambodian Pracheachorn Party
which is “quiescent”, since that country’s
Government, far from putting “hands
around its throat”, is simply waiting for
South Vietnam to fall to the Hanoi-con-
trolled gueriilla army-and-party.] Why,
again why, does Dr Cairns try to put
across a ludicrous, demonstrably erron-
eous thesis and wage a campaign of what
can only be described as evasive ob-
fuscation?
Saigon from the Right
Squaring the discussion circle
By BRIAN JOHNS
Tt was a private gathering, and mostly
■*" all of the 100 guests at the Castle-
crag home of Sydney Queen’s Counsel
Edward St John last Thursday night,
who heard Federal Liberal backbencher
Henry Basil Turner debate Australia’s
Vietnam policy with Morris West (“I’m
a liberal but not an organisation man”),
were Liberals. In a way this meeting of
top people was a measure of Turner’s
political standing. The member for
Bradfield’s independence and courage
place him among that handful of Gov-
ernment backbenchers whose stance on
any issue is not a foregone conclusion—
and his ability makes what he has to
say almost always interesting.
Turner is one of the “rebels” in Fed-
eral Parliament who at times will actual-
ly back his words with the deed of vot-
ing against the Government. The most
recent occasion was in the closing days
of the last Parliamentary session, when,
with his good friend and fellow Govern-
ment gadfly William Wentworth, he vot-
ed with the Opposition against amend-
ments to the Electoral Act.
However, Turner’s most determined
concern since he entered Federal Par-
liament from the NSW State House in
1951 has been in foreign affairs and de-
fence.
Turner visited Vietnam for three days
late last month with the young Victorian
Federal Country Party member, Peter
Nixon. Both had been members of a six-
man Parliamentary delegation to Japan,
Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the
Philippines. Turner and Nixon then paid
their own way to Saigon, Kuala Lumpur,
Singapore and Djakarta, to see for them-
selves.
It was cautious optimism, but optimism
nonetheless, that Turner brought back
from Saigon. After meeting the four
leading figures in the Vietnamese Gov-
ernment, Air Vice-Marshal Ky (“a lithe,
dynamic person who walks with the
step of a panther”), the Chairman of the
Directory, General Thieu, the Secretary-
General, General Chieu, and the For-
eign Minister, Dr Do, Turner is con-
vinced that the military junta is the only
practicable Government.
“It is quite logical and understand-
able that this is the case. You could
not conduct elections in the present tur-
bulence. It is a state of war and the war
is all around the Government. Anything
that has to be done needs the co-opera-
tion of the military. This was why an
American was able to tell me that ‘we
are getting more economic aid than we
pan use’. Of course it is important that
this aid should come from as many na-
tions as possible because it means moral
support for the Vietnamese.”
Turner has no doubts about the sin-
cerity and dedicated policies of the mili-
tary junta. “Ky is a young man and is


determined to use youth and vigor to the
utmost. He seems to have the ability
necessary to enthuse the young Vietnam-
ese. What augurs well is that in Ky the
Buddhist, and General Thieu the Catho-
lic, you have harnessed the two chief
elements in Vietnam.” But Turner does
admit to two big worries about the pres-
ent Government whether the Army
will hold together and whether Ky has
the administrative and political experi-
ence necessary to see him through the
disruption and tensions w'ithin the Gov-
ernment itself.
Touring their visit Turner and Nixon
flew in by helicopter to a “New Life”
hamlet about 20 miles outside Saigon.
There they saw the futility of any com-
parison of Vietnam with the Malayan
emergency. The “New Life” hamlets are
part of the Hop Tak, or co-operation,
operation which the Vietnamese Govern-
ment is attempting to carry out on the
Mekong Delta within a radius of about
50 miles of Saigon, and taking in about
40 per cent of the population.
Hop Tak has been likened to an oil
drop the good stays where the drop
lies. First, there is the military operation
when the attempt is made to clear out
the Vietcong and establish a local militia
to police the area. Then there is the
civil operation, when schools, medical
centres, etc., are set up. “The whole
thing is quite unlike Malaya. There, the
colonial administration and the military
worked like,two arms of one body. In
Vietnam, as I have said, nothing can be
done without the involvement of the
military. In Malaya the villages were
important as much for those they kept
in the Chinese as they kept out.
In Vietnam the insurgents cannot be
identified by race. The military forces in
Malaya overwhelmingly outnumbered
the Communists, which is far from the
case in Vietnam. Despite ‘the Cairns
line’ the Vietcong are receiving and need
substantial reinforcements from the
North.
“If the Vietcong, as Cairns and others
suggest, really do have the support of
the local people, why do they find it
necessary to mutilate civilians and those
who are helping to provide medical ser-
vices and so on?”
Turner believes that the Communists
have been “frightfully, frightfully cun-
ning” in confusing Australian and world
opinion about the real nature of the Viet-
nam war. “The Communists have mount-
ed a major psychological offensive. The
Australian Government must meet this
by explaining to the public the facts aiid
circumstances of the war. People ate
saying this is a brutal war, a dirty war.
All war is. I don’t know if the position
is more intolerable than it was on the
Western Front in World War I or than
in theatres of World War II.”
Turner—who was lieutenant and pla-
toon commander with the 2nd/3rd bat-
talion, serving in North Africa, Greece,
Syria and the Kokoda Trail —and Nixon
visited the Australians at Bien Hoa. He
said that the local American commander
had highly praised the troops and that
General Maxwell Taylor had told him
he was grateful for the battalion’s pres-
ence.
. There is little of the rebel about Tur-
ner in appearance or manner. Now in
his mid-fifties he has the gentlemanly,
reserved air of. the comfortable lawyer
of inherited wealth he might have been
had he not entered politics as a UAP
supporter in the mid-’thirties. He comes
H. B. TURNER
from a well-established Australian family
and describes his father, who formed
the Woolwich Chemical Company, later
merged with the Drug Houses of Aus-
tralia, as “a manufacturer”. He took an
Arts degree at Sydney University and
read Law at Cambridge.
He was a member of the Oxbridge
group which introduced the first real
threat of a split in the Coalition when
it antagonised McEwen by challenging
his view of the dire straits in which Aus-
tralia would find itself if Britain entered
the Common Market. “We were not
supporting England against Australia, of
course; we merely felt that Britain’s entry
was inevitable. Perhaps we underesti-
mated de Gaulle. No, it is still inevit-
able”. His friendship with Leslie Bury,
who, dropped from the Ministry because
of public statements on the Common
Market, was the major fatality suffered
by the Oxbridge group, had begun years
before.
“Leslie was at Cambridge with my
younger brother who went up the year
after l came down. And when Leslie
came out to Australia my younger broth-
er he has a property at Goulburn,
you can mention that, it might interest
those who think I am against country
interests wrote and asked me to look
after this small chap Bury. So you see
I was a bit surprised by this ‘small
chap’s’ six foot five when we met.”
One of the more cruel things about
political life is that failure to be pro-
moted rarely escapes public notice. Tur-
ner is undoubtedly sensitive about being
passed over for the Ministry. But he has
little of the aggrieved air of “I told them
so” that others whose ambitions have
'been frustrated find so difficult to avoid.
Last year Mr McEwen, in a sharp aside
to a provocative question by Turner on
the old issue of the Common Market,
questioned Turner’s loyalty. He was tak-
en on only a few days later by an ex-
tremely angry Turner.
Turner also seems sensitive about his
private means. He once remarked that
his money, which helped him to be in-
dependent, might have also sheltered him
from the competitive involvement that
accompanies political manoeuvring. The
father of four —“two married daughters,
the third is studying political science
in Canberra under Professor Crisp”—
Turner is very proud of the way his son,
Basil, studied for the matriculation after
being at sea for a number of years and
went to university on a Commonwealth
scholarship, taking the University Medal
in geography on his way. Turner him-
self has ridden a Lambretta motor
scooter for several years, leaving the
family Volkswagen for his wife’s use.
He has spent all of his political life
on his home ground of the “real” North
Shore, going into the State House as the
member for Gordon (after an extraordin-
ary contest with a fellow-Liberal, which
he won by only seven votes, surviving
three recounts and an appeal to the
Court of Disputed Returns with the de-
cision being sealed by 20 postal votes
held up on a ship wrecked on its way
from Norfolk Island) in 1937. He went
through three elections in 13 months,
but when he enlisted in 1941 he had a
whopping majority. His Federal elector-
ate of Bradfield which he took over
from Billy Hughes is almost exactly co-
terminous with his old Gordon elec-
torate.
A few months ago Turner moved
from the Federal Members’ rooms in
Martin Place to an office above a
butcher shop at Gordon to save an hour
and a half of train travelling each day
from his Killara home. This might give
him more time for his favorite relaxation
—carpentry. “I think perhaps why I like
it so much is that you can see some-
thing concrete for your work. It is hard-
er to see what you have done in
politics.”


OVERSEAS
VIETNAM
New Ratios
Oo far the decade-long US commitment
—including the build-up of troops
which in the latest stage has grown to
73,000 men, and punitive air raids on
North Vietnam over the past six months
- has neither curtailed the Communist
warfare nor persuaded Hanoi to nego-
tiate. After his return. Defence Secretary
McNamara noted last week that the
situation in South Vietnam in many
aspects had deteriorated since his last
visit 15 months ago.
Communist strength now is estimated
at more than 165,000 fighters. This
compares with the Government’s 500,000
regular army and militia troops plus the
73,000 Americans. Mr McNamara said
last week that this is a “totally un-
acceptable ratio”. It is generally held
that a 10-to-l ratio is necessary to stamp
out guerrilla warfare, although many
military observers believe that a lower
ratio possibly 4-to-l —might suffice
in South Vietnam because of the Viet-
cong’s increasing use of more conven-
tional, open forms of combat. There
has been talk of doubling the American
force by the end of the summer and
raising it to 200,000 by next January.
There is little question in Saigon that
the US is preparing to take over the main
burden of the ground war from the Sou:h
Vietnamese. The general plan calls for
a chain of strong American bases
stretching the length of South Vietnam’s
coast.
GREECE
Troubled Times
Tj\)R nearly all the 17 years of the reign
■*- of King Constantine’s father, King
Paul, Greece was ruled by a Rightist
regime. Then, about the time Paul died
early in 1964 and Constantine ascended
the throne, Mr George Papandreou’s
Centre Union Party displaced the Right-
ists in a smashing election victory. As
Premier, Mr Papandreou moved to purge
the army of Rightist officers he con-
sidered disloyal to his regime, sought
to oust his Defence Minister (who
opposed the purge), and announced
plans to take over the Defence Ministry
himself.
King Constantine balked. He refused,
the week before last, to sign a decree
dismissing the Defence Minister. Con-
stantine was concerned over allegations
that a secret Left-wing society called
Aspida (shield) had been uncovered
within the army. Constantine also feared
that an army purge would expose the
armed forces to Communist influences.
The showdown came in a 15-minute
meeting between the Premier and the
King on July 15. Mr Papandreou said
that if the King did not sign the dis-
missal decree he would resign.
Last week Mr Papandreou took his
cause to the people, and mass demonstra-
tions demanding his return to power
broke out. Police squads using tear gas
battled demonstrators in the streets of
Athens. One student was killed and 130
persons were injured. Premier Athana-
siadis-Novas, having formed a Cabinet
with a defecting minority from Mr
Papandreou’s camp, is to ask Parliament
this week for a vote of confidence.
THE US
Quiet Revolt
Quietly and without drama, there has
been a revolution in official and
legislative thinking in the US on the sub-
ject of using foreign aid money to help
spread birth control information and ap-
paratus in such countries as India.
First, President Johnson, soon after
his election, said that be was prepared
to consider giving birth control assistance
to countries that asked for it. He said
it quietly but unmistakably, and it caused
no fuss. Then ex-President Eisenhower
changed his mind. He had disapproved
such assistance when he had power.
In a formal statement recently, he made
it plain that he, too, considered such as-
sistance legitimate if asked for. And,
finally, there was Cardinal Cushing,
Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston.
He is a rough-hewn Prince of the
Church, a man of power who is widely
loved. He said that although birth con-
troll was illegal still for Catholics, he
could no longer oppose its use by others
who wanted it.
Once certain key words had a ter-
rible potency in the United States.
Among them were socialism, illicit sex,
welfare State, coddling. They could stop
almost any project dead. And public
bodies had to maintain an image of old-
fashioned rectitude and watch out for
the Catholic vote. But freedom is real,
and those words have lost their power
and the Catholics are both less aggres-
sive and less aggrieved.
YUGOSLAVIA
Moscow
Summer
HPhe Supreme Court of Croatia, sitting
in Zagreb, has ruled that Mihajlo
Mihajlow should not be sent to goal for
his penetrating account of his visit to
the Soviet Union, “Moscow Summer,
1964”. The Bulletin published extracts
from the report in an article by Frank
Osvald (8., April 10, 1965). On April
30, the Zadar District Court found the
young Yugoslav writer guilty of offend-
ing the USSR in the two sections of his
report published in the Belgrade literary
magazine “Delo”, and of distributing the
material abroad after it was banned. He
was sentenced to a total of nine months
in prison on both counts. Hearing Mi-
hajlov’s appeal, the Supreme Court has
dismissed the first charge ruling that,
while he had offended the “feelings” of
the Yugoslav people and the Soviet
Union, his article did not contain “ele-
ments of a criminal offence”. The sec-
ond charge was upheld, but Mihajlov
has received a five-month suspended sen-
tence and is now on probation for two
years.
THE HAGUE
Guilty Defence
Australian President of the In-
A ternational Court, Sir Percy Spender,
has sent his 14 fellow-Judges home for
a two-month summer recess without any
of them being able to foresee when the
case over South-West Africa will end. It
has already broken several records. No
case has had longer oral proceedings
since the Court was established in 1922.
It is also the costliest ever held.
The South Africans—who keep a
team of 12 highly paid barristers and
officials at The Hague during the sessions
—spent more than £1,250,000 in pre-
paring the brief, which runs into 16
volumes. They had a staff of 120 people
working on it. It is expected that the
case will finally cost them between £4-
£5 million.
The applicants in the case—Ethiopia
and Liberia—are relying on only five
counsel, led by the distinguished Ameri-
can lawyer, Mr Ernest Gross. They
claim that South Africa’s attempts to
apply apartheid to the mandated terri-
tory of South-West Africa are in con-
flict with international law.
The South Africans argue that apar-
theid is in the best interests of the
500,000 Africans and the 70,000 whites
in the mandated territory. The appli-
cants’ legal team has caused confusion

BRITAIN
When to Stop
“T don’t know. I can tell you I wasn’t
keen. I was sorry he asked me.”
That was Lord Home’s reply to a ques-
tion in 1962 as to why Prime Minister
Harold Macmillan had named him
Foreign Secretary two years earlier.
Asked then if he wanted to be Prime
Minister, Lord Home said “No,” ex-
plaining: “After I had dipped fairly
deeply into my first bottle of port my
father said to me: ‘You know, the most
important thing in life is to know when
to stop’.”
In 1963, however, Lord Home was
Prime Minister. An ailing Mr Mac-
millan had picked him as successor to
reunite the Tories. Lord Home gave up
his title, becoming Sir Alec Douglas-
Home, and took up his post in the House
of Commons. But Labor strength grew
and in elections last October they
squeezed into power.
According to the “New York Times”
Sir Alec responded to apparent behind-
the-scenes pressure within the party and
resigned. He explained, “A consideraole
number of people felt another leader
might be better able to win a 'general
election.”
THE UAR
Full Circle
are unmistakable signs in Cairo
that President Nasser and the United
States are on the brink of a new honey-
moon.
The wheel has spun almost full circle
since the crisis days last December
when President Nasser angrily told the
US it could drink the Mediterranean —
and if that was not enough, the Red Sea.
Why the change?
Regular food supplies must be assur-
ed for several years if Egypt’s develop-
ment plans are not to be hopelessly
crippled. The US is the world’s only
large-scale supplier of free virtually
giveaway food. Secondly, President
Nasser is reliably reported to believe
that the Sino-Soviet dispute gives the
US great scope for untrammelled, un-
contested action, as seen in Vietnam,
Stanleyville and San Domingo. The
value and effectiveness of non-alignment
and Afro-Asianism have corresponding-
ly diminished.
The third reason Nasser is anxious
to secure American goodwill concerns
his present almost inextricable difficul-
ties in the Yemen.

The Italian Seven Per Cent
Easily assimilated but the battle upwards will be tougher
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
It is almost a century since the
Spanish statesman Castelar con-
gratulated the successors to Cavour
and Garibaldi on the completion of the
Union of Italy which “Savonarola could
not achieve by giving himself to God,
nor Machiavelli by giving himself to
the Devil”. The Iberian nobleman per-
ceived a characteristic Southern Euro-
pean, and particularly Italian, quality:
the ability to make the best of both
worlds, perhaps, indeed, the best of any
world.
Consider the Italian in Australia as he
busily sets about carving out his piece
of good fortune from the Lucky Coun-
try. He is well aware that he is fre-
quently sneered at as a “dago” behind
his back, and sometimes to his face,
by much of ‘the native population, that
he is public transport's sacrificial offering
to any drunken loud-mouth.
He soon comes to understand that
the dribbling of spaghetti on a fork,
the pouring on of olive oil, the sipping
of cheap wine, and the persistent smell
of stale garlic are regarded by many
Australians as threats to the Yorkshire-
Pudding-Irish-Stew way of life. He may
guess that in the less literate groups he
is commonly thought to either belong
or pay protection dues to the Mafia,
and to carry a stiletto in the black
lining of his coat.
The small brown man from Cala-
bria and his fairer countryman from
the Venetian foothills shrug their well-
muscled shoulders without complaint.
They are not much interested in joining
the Weird Mob at the table or at the
club bar. They are much more con-
cerned to join in the national scramble
for home-ownership and consumer
durables. The garlic onion rests just
as easily in the Carlton refrigerator as
on the pine-bench in Palermo.
Despite. the irritation caused by the
effect of Mediterranean customs on
Australian provincial boorishness, there
is not much dangerous friction now
between those of Italian origin and
other Australians. Nothing like the
troubles of a generation ago now seems
possible. In 1934, for example, there
occurred the “anti-dago” riots at
Boulder and Kalgoorlie. These were
sparked off by a fist fight between an
Australian and a Northern Italian bar-
tender in which the Australian, who was
a popular local footballer, suffered con-
cussion and died the following day.
Southern and Central Europeans were
the target in the rioting which exploded.
Fifty of their homes were burnt and
five of their shops (presumably all
available) were burnt and looted. Most
of the non-British population of the
goldfields were terrified for their lives
and many fled into the bush for some
days. Violence had previously broken
out against Italians on the goldfields
in 1918, and in the 1890 s when allega-
tions were made that employers were
importing Italians to work at cut rates.
Another recorded case of strong
opposition to Italians occurred in 1927
when a number of public meetings were
held to try to prevent the settlement
of Italian farmers on the Murrumbidgee
Irrigation Area. The basic hostility in
each of these cases, although supple-
mented by social and cultural factors,
was economic in its origins. Australian
ITALIAN MIGRANTS ARRIVE
workers have always had a strong fear
of the dangers of the immigration of
cheap labor. At various times in our
history this has led to hostility to the
Irish, Italians, Kanakas, Japanese and
Chinese. The resentments of the manual
workers have sometimes been shared by
farmers who have not welcomed the
prospect of competition from hard-work-
ing and thrifty Italian farmers. In 1954
defenders of the Italian community in
the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area town
of Griffith were called “white dagoes”.
In the post-war period there has
been an amount of resistance to
Italians stemming from the prejudice
that they are “Giuseppes-come-lately”
into the affluent promised continent.
The same prejudice faces Italians who
moved north into Switzerland, Ger-
many, and France under the protection
of the Common Market.
It is not well enough appreciated in
Australia that Italian migration has
played a crucial role in our economic
development. After the British Isles,
Italy has supplied the largest share of
our population. The figures have not
been kept exactly but there is no doubt
that over 7 per cent of Australians
are of Italian descent, over three-
quarters of a million, individuals.
And they can hardly be said to have
only come lately. The present Sydney
suburb of Matraville takes its name
from James Maria Matra, a midship-
man of Italian origin who sailed with
Captain Cook and played a major role
in releasing the Endeavour from the
Barrier Reef. In Sydney before the gold
rush there were enough Italians for the
promotion of Italian opera seasons. The
Australian Ambassador to Rome, Mr
A. T. Stirling, recounted recently that
the Rome Opera House last year pro-
duced for the first time Verdi’s early
opera “Attila”, whereas Sydney saw
this opera in 1848, only two years after
it was written.
Many more Italians arrived during
the gold rush including that great
patriot, and hero of mid-Victorian
romanticism, Garibaldi, one of whose
sons settled near Port Jackson. Garibaldi
was one of a large number of political
exiles who came to Australia before
returning to continue their successful
fight for a united fatherland. One family
which came over in the latter half of
the nineteenth century and chose to
remain eventually produced three Aus-
tralian generals. Better known, per
medium of junior history texts, is the
story of the red-headed Roman, Rafaele


Carboni, who was one of the most
important cadres with Peter Lalor at
the Eureka Stockade.
It seems that in fighting and in sport
generally Italians are best able to win
national acclaim. Widely acclaimed as
the best boxer in Australia, Rocky
Gattellari is a leading contender for the
world flyweight title. The names of foot-
ballers Ron Barassi and Sergio Silvagni
are as familiar to Victorians as those of
Robert Gordon Menzies and James
Bond. It is, as the Marxists say, no
accident that Italians excel in physical
contact sports like Australian football
and boxing, and gruelling sports like
cycling. By background and constitution
they are well suited for hard work.
Most of the Italian migrants since the
First World War have avoided the avo-
cations of their countrymen of earlier
decades: the barrowmen, waiters,
hawkers, and musicians. (Exceptions to
this occur in the case of small shop-
keeping, and in the State of Queens-
land where 85 per cent of all Italians
are on the land mostly growing sugar.)
The census statistics analysed by Dr
G. Zubrzycki of the Australian
National University in his book “Immi-
grants in Australia” reveal that of the
Italian-born population in Australia most
are occupied in manufacturing (32 per
cent), primary production (20 per cent),
and building and construction (14 per
cent). The first two percentages are well
above the national migrant average and
it is significant that most Italians in
primary production are engaged in the
more arduous tasks of market gardening,
small scale mixed agriculture and
dairying, whilst most of the males in
manufacturing work in the physically
demanding metal trades. The lucrative
and leisurely pastoral industries contain
almost no Italians (and very few other
migrants). Italians are well below the
migrant average in professional life, in
finance, property and business services.
fPHE vast majority of Italian migrants
have come from poor (but not subsis-
tence-level) rural districts where they
have been self-employed or family-
employed. It is not surprising that a
higher proportion of Italians than other
migrants are self-employed in Australia.
Migrants, overall, have a smaller per-
centage than native Australians in the
employer, and self-employed, categories
of industry. But Italians rank above the
national average. The figures available
do suggest that this tendency is weaken-
lng, partly because of the high capital
costs of beginning any kind of farm-
ing in Australia and partly because of
the job opportunities for all members
°f the family in the capital cities. The
Percentage of Italians in Australia not
m the work-force is much smaller than
the migrant average.
This last circumstance is not only
due to the strong desire to get the whole
family contributing to the weekly
income. As with other Southern Euro-
pean groups it is easier to get male
than female migrants. The 1954 census
showed that there were 80,000 Italian-
born males in Australia but only 39,000
females. The Immigration Department
has made strong efforts to correct this
imbalance which has caused serious social
and personal problems in the Italian
community, as witnessed in the espresso
bar girl-hiring rackets. The answer lies
not so much in trying to defeat long-
established Italian customs by enticing
more single female migrants as in
encouraging family migration. The
difficulty with family migration is that
few Italians qualify for assisted passages.
The Italian custom _ of strictly
chaperoning girls sometimes has an
unfortunate effect in districts of Aus-
tralia where the ratio of Italian men
to Italian women is fairly balanced,
such as in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation
Area. It encourages the men to look
for girls outside their own racial com-
munity, girls whose families allow them
more freedom. An Italian family can
thus sometimes find itself landed with a
set of well-brought up spinsters.
Another problem for Italians, especially
those from Calabria, the Lapari Islands,
and Sicily, is often raised by certain
conflicts between their native religious
attitudes and those of the Irish-oriented
in recent years. The Madonna cult, how-
ever, can make Western devotion to the
Virgin Mary seem by comparison almost
puritan in its restraint.
A prejudiced Northerner once put
it to me that Calabrians considered
Christ in only three ways, in terms
of His infancy, His youth, and His
death on the Cross. “The rest,” he
declared, “they neglect, especially the
Sermon on the Mount. They simply
refuse to believe that Christ could have
uttered such impracticable advice.”
Whatever the truth of this, it is clear
that a number of Italians have difficulty
in adapting themselves to the demands,
attitudes and ceremonies of the Churph
in Australia. Religion is thus not always
a strong pressure towards the assimila-
tion and integration of Italians into Aus-
tralian society.
The predominance of what demo-
graphers call “chain migration” also
hinders integration. Nearly all migrants
from Calabria, Campagna and Sicily
have friends and relatives in Australia.
The chain is begun by a pioneer or
pioneer family who send back letters
and information from Australia and
sometimes even return to the village of
their birth, usually for a holiday. Their
reports of the economic opportunities
in Australia, and their frequent financial
assistance, are often enough to encourage
the migration of relatives and friends,
Italian Catholicism v. an Irish Church
Australian Catholics. Catholics from the
Irish tradition tend to be strict in their
observance of the Church's formal
demands, such as attendance at Sunday
Mass and the abstention from meat on
Fridays. Many Southern Italians,
although fiercely religious in some ways,
prefer to attend Mass at Christmas and
Easter and on certain feast days. They
don’t seem to have many scruples about
lowering their heads over a Friday dish
of steaming spaghetti and meat. Some
Australian priests, trained in the Irish
mode, alienated Italian families by insist-
ing that what the Italian often regards
as minor peccadillos are serious offences
against God.
There are also some differences in
everyday theology, or, occasionally
perhaps, superstition. It has been said
that the real Trinity of some Southern
Italians is composed, not of the Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit, but of the
Madonna, Joseph and Jesus. The cult
of the Madonna does seem to be the
central religious expression of some of
the less sophisticated migrants. Some
leading Catholic theologians have
expressed alarm at the nature of Marian
devotions in the Irish-influenced Church
who in turn carry out their role in the
migration chain by attracting and
assisting their friends to come out.
Up to 50 per cent of the population
of some villages have been led to migrate
in this way. This has also happened in
the north: over a thousand of the Italian
population of Griffith may be traced
to the town of Cavaso del Tomba in
the Venetian foothills.
The percentage of these migrants
who later leave Australia permanently
is low. This suggests that most of the
migrants from Italy are reasonably
contented in Australia, presumably
because chain migration has relieved
them of many of the terrors of migrant
alienation. Assimilation is usually a
three-generation process, but the chain
of friends and neighbors takes much of
the agony out of it.
The Italian 7 per cent, armed with
its virtues of diligence, physical
endurance and thrift, is well equipped
for securing its immediate objectives of
home-ownership, a kitchen full of metal
durables, and substantial quantities of
bright paint. The later and inevitable
battle for upward social movement will
be tougher.

Letters to the Editor
Opera And " Our Joan"
SlR.—“Batman’s” comments (8., July
24) regarding the total disregard by
Press and management alike of Joan
Sutherland’s associate (not supporting)
artists during the current opera season
were pungent and to the point. How-
ever, he did not, or could not, pinpoint
why this neglect is harmful not only to
the artists and the box office, but also
to the cause of opera in Australia. How
many people, I wonder, are missing a
superb entertainment because of this
unmerciful plugging of “Our Joan’’?
For the record, let me give a few
facts. All the singers playing leading
roles during this season have played
similar parts in international opera
houses like the Metropolitan and
Covent Garden. No less than eleven (!),
not counting Miss Sutherland, have
made no less than 46 different appear-
ances on records which are on sale in
Australia right now 7 . In fact, most of
them are better than any guest “star”
imported by the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust since Sena Jurinac ten years or so
ago. One must go back to Melba’s
Australian seasons to find a company
with two leading tenors who could hold
their own with Luciano Pavarotti and
John Alexander. Brought out individu-
ally, each would have filled a theatre
on his own name; in the shadow of
Miss Sutherland they are almost for-
gotten. This applies all the more to the
ladies of the company. Would that we
could see and hear a charmer like
Elizabeth Harwood every year. In Elisir
d’Amore (a superb production which
can be enjoyed by all) she is delightful,
and her performances in Joan Suther-
land’s parts should prove not inferior,
if totally different, from the Diva's
glamorous first nights.
One could go on much longer, but
should not all this be said by J. C.
Williamson’s publicity department? And
should not the Press be interested in
featuring such eminent artists who must
have more than one interesting story
to tell? Who knows Sydney does not
have Australian Rules football; perhaps
that city’s newspapers will find the room
Melbourne papers apparently can’t
spare.

Castration And 1984
SIR.—Roy Perrott (8., July 17) is less
critical of the system of castrating sex
offenders than was the party of British
criminologists with whom I visited Her-
stedvester and other Danish prisons a
few years ago. In particular he fails to
mention two fundamental shortcomings
which emerged during our investigation.
The first is that, although castration
is not in theory compulsory, it does in
effect become a form of blackmail. The
offender is not in the position of a free
man. He is given the choice of staying in
prison a very long time indeed, perhaps
for life, and being released in the near
future if he agrees to the operation. With
difficult cases there must always be a
strong temptation to encourage castration
rather than persevere with treatment, and
the definition of “last resort” in these
circumstances becomes dubious.
The other drawback is the emotional
and other difficulties which follow castra-
tion. This was not, we found, a subject
which the Danish psychiatrists and ad-
ministrators cared to talk much about,
but the effects can evidently be serious.
One consequence, we were told, is that
castrated offenders sometimes become
homosexual.
Castration is a confession of defeat,
and it is not difficult to see in it. a
dangerous step in the direction of 1984.

Teach-Ins
SlR.—While not being concerned to
confirm or refute the editorial comment
of your last issue on other University
teach-ins, may I suggest that there is
a way that universities can usefully help
the public debate on Vietnam? The
Department of Adult Education of
Sydney University, in co-operation with
Channel 7, Sydney, is presenting a Viet-
nam teach-in on Saturday, July 31. This
is a genuine attempt to place before the
public, the spectrum of issues and views
involved.

Marihuana
SIR.—I am afraid Simon Leigh (8., July
24) may have been misled by an un-
fortunate misprint in my article on mari-
huana. I wrote that it was “highly pro-
bable" that graduation from marihuana
to opiates was actually encouraged by the
misleading inclusion of marihuana in the
list of addictive and dangerous drugs.
This came out in print as “highly impro-
bable". Mr Leigh on the other hand be-
lieves that the legal restriction “almost
certainly lowers the number” of such
cases. He may be right, but although
it is frequently asserted that marihuana
smoking “leads to” the use of such drugs
as cocaine, morphine and heroin, the
La Guardia Committee (which was
appointed by the New York Academy of
Medicine) could not find any evidence
that it did. I am inclined to doubt whether
this sequence is very common. In my ex-
perience hemp-smokers are as much re-
pelled by the idea of opiate addiction as
beer and spirit drinkers usually are.

Our Own Deterrent
SlR.—Some people who have studied the
problem fear that if Australia should
possess a nuclear deterrent or permit US
nuclear forces or facilities to be located
in Australia, China would turn Indonesia
into another Cuba. But perhaps Indo-
nesia will be turned into another Cuba
just as soon as China is in a position to
do so irrespective of our defences. To
preclude such a reaction on China’s part
it has been suggested by one group of
people that we should rely upon a “fall
back"' guarantee. This would involve a
guarantee by the US or UK or both that,
should we be threatened with a nuclear
attack, our allies would come to our
aid with nuclear weapons. As attractive
as this proposition sounds it has obvious
weaknesses.
First, it would be very difficult to
obtain such a guarantee. Secondly, who
would determine whether Australia was
or w 7 as not under a nuclear threat in terms
of the agreement, and how long would
it take to make such a decision? Thirdly,
we may be in danger of invasion without
any nuclear threat. Fourthly, because of
a change in the strategic situation or be-
cause our protectors may be under a
direct nuclear threat themselves they may
decline to honor the agreement.
To prevent further proliferation of
nuclear weapons a similar suggestion has
been made that the UK should maintain
a nuclear umbrella for the protection of
countries east of Suez.
Taking all factors into consideration it
would appear that the only way for us
to be sure of our nuclear defence is for
us to have our own nuclear deterrent at
all times. Only if we have a finger on our
own trigger shall we be able to counter
any threat or nuclear blackmail.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Opera —the Swan-song
of a “Dead” Art?
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Sometimes you wonder how the
Elizabethan Theatre Trust staff get
up and face another day, particularly
at this time of the year when their
balance sheet is spread out in front of
every critic, leader-writer and writer of
letters to the editor in the country.
This year the prime target has been
opera, which must be particularly try-
ing for the Elizabethan. Because of the
Sutherland-Williamson season its own
company is dispersed some singers
overseas to gain experience they ap-
parently cannot get here, some to “Don
Pasquale”, at Sydney’s Rockdale Town
Hall, others to the chorus with the Suth-
erland company.
Out of the last few years’ hard ex-
perience, the Elizabethan has reached
some conclusions on opera, such as:
• Opera audiences in this country
haven't increased in the past 10 years,
but have only grown in proportion to the
population.
• There is no public for opera as
opera. There is a public for 12 to 15
operas which win guaranteed audiences,
and a public for stars, but they must be
stars of the magnitude of Joan Suther-
land. This applies all over the world.
• Modest performances will always
win modest audiences.
These conclusions are cruelly borne
out by the Sutherland-Williamson sea-
son. As the general manager of JCW’s,
Mr John McCallum, has admitted, there
are “people hanging from the ceiling on
Sutherland nights and then only 300 at-
tending on other nights”. This pathetic
300 compares with average attendances
for the Elizabethan’s 1964 season of 961
in Sydney, 769 in Melbourne, 418 in
Brisbane and 873 during the Adelaide
Festival.
However, the attitude of the Elizabe-
than towards Williamson’s endeavors is
far more gracious than standing back
and saying, “We told you so”. The
Elizabethan has underwritten the season
for a set amount. If the losses go above
this figure (which will be made public
in the Trust's balance sheet for 1965)
Williamson’s bear the additional loss. If
there had been a profit the Trust would
have got it back in sets and costumes,
which have been judged by one critic to
be of a standard which would be “dis-
dained by any suburban musical comedy
society”
Now Williamson’s probably will leave
~ . F , . 3
them to moulder in their store-rooms,
or persuade the Trust-or, perhaps, a
suburban musical comedy society—to
buy them.
At most, the Trust’s gesture in subsi-
dising Williamson’s swan-song in opera
SUTHERLAND...star.
HAAG...opera is dead.
VAN PRAAGH...costs.
will leave it richer in experience and in
second-hand costumes. However, the
Williamson season may have convinced
many more people that opera is an ex-
pensive business. It certainly makes the
figures in the Elizabethan’s 1964 bal-
ance sheet appear less formidable.
Last year's accounts, which showed a
loss of £77,554, yielded a record crop
of criticisms, the main one being that
opera and ballet are taking money away
from drama. The opera company cost
£365,290 and earned £172,561. The
figures for ballet were £354,290 and
£286,537, and for drama £246,392 and
£176,857.
Mr Haag, the executive director of
the Trust, in an interview with The
Bulletin, admitted that opera had been
attacked “right, left and centre” since
the accounts had been published. Mr
Haag is more than willing to answer
most criticisms. However, Miss Peggy
van Praagh, the joint artistic direc-
tor of the Ballet Company, has found the
best answer so far. “Not losses, costs,
costs,” Miss van Praagh says forcefully.
Mr Haag’s short answer, which may
not satisfy everyone, on money for drama
against opera and ballet is that drama
costs less.
Mr Haag is far from having no ideas
on opera and its future in Australia. He
said that the Trust’s policy is, at the
moment, “fluid”. However, by the end
of the year some firm decisions will be
made and made public.
“Opera is our greatest headache,” Mr
Haag said. “ In opera we can’t aim realis-
tically at an international standard. There
may be several things we can do. We can
create an identification of the public
with the old repertory pieces. Or we can
have stars, but that is something one
can hardly justify under our charter.”
Mr Haag said that he believed opera
was a “dead” art as opposed to ballet or
drama. “Opera has shown itself incapable
of a sucessful contemporary contribu-
tion.” he said. “There might be 100 new
operas done each year in Germany’s
43 opera houses, but how many of them
survive?”
To him, putting on only the estab-
lished repertory operas was the equiva-
lent of having an art gallery filled only
with old masters. Here, of course, he
parts company with many other people,
perhaps more pessimistic or realistic,
who are concerned with opera, including
Mr Richard Bonynge.
Mr Haag said that it was much easier
to get close to world standard with ballet.
You needed only an acceptable number
of dancers of a standard and some new
and imaginative choreography.
“I don't mean by this that our company
is where we want it,” he said. ‘‘But we
can get some of the excitement of inter-
national standards. At least we are in
the market. New ballets, like ‘Yugen’
and ‘The Display’, engender audience
excitement. You get the existing audiences
and new converts.
“In drama we feel that our regional
policy is p'aying off, and that we can
develop audiences on a sounder footing.
We feel that in drama we are securing a
lasting association with an increasing
section of the community for whom the
theatre is becoming a habit. Last year
our total audiences for drama were more
than for opera and ballet combined.”
(The figures were: ballet' 159,359,
opera 181,332 and drama 359,233,- but
drama does include Young Elizabethans.)
Mr Haag said the Trust felt that the
drama audiences would prove more loyal
than, say, ballet. He realised that if the
excitement of new ballet was removed,
the audiences could melt very quickly.


Ballantyne’s Battles
By TERRY STAPLETON
During rehearsals he sits at a small
table in the darkened auditorium.
He holds an inevitable cigarette
with his fingers impossibly close to the
lighted tip. The only signs of tension
are a jumping jaw muscle and a tapping
right foot. As the rehearsal progresses
his personality rips through any tangled
impasse like a power mower. His voice
can be commanding, reassuring, lacera-
ting; the consonants explode, the “r’s”
roll and the vowel sounds elongate
incredibly. He is the second most popular
and controversial talking point of
Adelaide theatre. The first is the Festival
of Arts. Next comes Colin Sandergrove
Ballantyne.
A Ballantyne production has a special
something which even his detractors
readily concede. The audience feels that
an experienced and mature man of the
theatre is about to make a statement.
“Theatre,” says Ballantyne, “allows a
rare opportunity to reaffirm one’s view-
point. One doesn’t set out to make state-
ments but they occur.”
They have occurred in nearly 50 pro-
ductions since the war. Between Shake-
speare’s “Twelfth Night” in 1946 and
Patricia Hooker’s “Season in Hell” in
1965, Ballantyne has fought mostly
winning, occasionally losing, battles with
O'Neill, Miller, Williams, Sartre, Saroyan.
He has produced Mozart’s “The Magic
Flute” and for the 1964 Festival of Arts
“The Play of Daniel” (a religious,
musical play produced by agnostic, non-
musical Ballantyne).
At 56, when most men are slowing
down, Ballantyne seems busier than
ever. As President of Adelaide Theatre
Group’s highly successful Sheridan
Theatre he is continually either pro-
ducing, advising, planning or admini-
strating. He still finds time to run a
thriving photographic studio in North
Adelaide.
Ballantyne surrenders himself com-
pletely to a production schedule. His
patience snaps at any lack of total in-
volvement from his cast. His fierce
demands can reduce an actor to frenzied
despair or even tears. Ballantyne ex-
plains: “With amateurs one cannot use
the economic spur. One can become,
instead, a symbol of force, pressure,
discipline. The theatre should not be a
comfortable place.”
Neither the theatre nor the world has
ever been a comfortable place for Colin
Ballantyne. Born in Adelaide in 1908
he grew up in a house dominated by a
mother and aunt firmly committed to
women’s suffrage. His father, “a figure
of considerable mystery”, tended to go
his own uncompromising way, but the
family came together over matters such
as art and theatre. The bookshelves
were full of Ibsen, Shaw and Wells; the
whole atmosphere was one of “intel-
lectual ferment”, and Ballantyne was
swept through his formative years with
the conviction that life existed for the
Ballantynes to be larger than. _
It was during the depression that
Ballantyne first heard the name which
was to have the greatest influence on his
theatrical thinking: Stanislavsky.
He found the Russian’s works “a
sudden and illuminating answer” to the
problems of actors and producers. Thirty
years have not dimmed his devotion.
“Any actor,” says Ballantyne, “is sub-
jected to such diverse and unqualified
criticism . . . there is a constant danger
that he will try to please everyone. His
sense of truth collapses. He needs a
gospel. When in trouble he should re-
worship at the shrine of Stanislavsky
the eternal reservoir.”
Ballantyne’s mind is broad, quick,
analytical and he never dodges contro-
versial issues. Some examples:
Adelaide Festival of Arts: “A success
despite itself . . . but drifting dangerously
close to the J. C. Williamson conception
that only imported stars have any pull.
Local productions must be given just
publicity. Otherwise there is a continual
denigration of Australian talent.”
Patrick White: “The most marvellously
sensitive novelist but, apart from “The
Ham Funeral”, his plays lack sensibility.”
Hal Porter: “Again, I am devoted to
his prose but his plays suggest he doesn’t
know what modern drama is all about.
There’s nothing wrong with Somerset
Maugham, but there’s a hell of a lot
wrong with Hal Porter writing like him.”
For many years Ballantyne has de-
voted much of his energy and eloquence
to the idea of an Australian national
theatre of world standard. He despairs
of the future of drama in this country
and snarls with criticism of the Eliza-
bethan Theatre Trust. “Drama,” he
thunders, “has been betrayed. Its forces
and pressures and clamors formed the
Trust and ballet and opera have
received the benefits. The first moment
of shattering disillusionment was the
appointment of Hugh Hunt ... he had
no conception of the standards required.
Drama needed the equivalent of a Peggy
Van Praagh.”
In a world quick to judge and anxious
to categorise, Ballantyne is destined often
to be conveniently dismissed as an
eccentric, a poseur.
His flamboyant personality, his ex-
travagant words and gestures are like raw
spirits to the Pineapple Pearl mentality.
In truth he does little to soften this
effect. In ordinary conversation he
frequently spurns one word where five
obscure ones will do and he is greatly
given to self-dramatisation. He can
describe a trip to the corner shop and
make it sound like a mission for James
Bond. But all these are merely
theatricalities—and it is as true of Ballan-
tyne as it is of the theatre itself that
beneath the facade of fantasy, grease-
paint, costumes and posturing, there is a
solid core of honesty, integrity, energy
and purpose.
RADIO
ABC’s New Sound
“We will be concerned with the way in
which we present our programmes,”
the ABC’s general manager, Mr Talbot
Duckmanton, said in a recent statement
on radio and television. He spoke mostly
of television, but unable to discern any
late changes in presentation there, I
dusted olf the radio and prepared to
discover a new sound at the top of the
dial. My expectation was sharpened by
a series of advertisements urging the
public to listen to Peter Young at night,
and a vague rumor that this was indeed
the breakthrough, or the moment of
truth when the ABC would thrust an-
nouncer and bull into the ring together,
with fanfare.
Mind you, wisdom suggested taking all
this with a grain of sawdust. While the
ABC had never led or followed commer-
cial radio in regarding its announcers as
a commodity to be sold to the public,
there always have been ABC “person-
alities” who were allowed to mention

In the old days many listeners knew that
Paul Maclay, James Dibble, Michael
Charlton, Martin Royal and co. read the
ABC national news. Fewer, but some,
were familiar with the names of John
West, as a mentor of show business, Eric
Child as an authority on jazz, and Russ
Tyson as the gentle philosopher who
made waking up so much more difficult
in the morning. Somehow these people
broke through, but they were carefully
rationed and rotated so that no listener
could become too infatuated with any
one of them.
But now, apparently, that was all in
the past, and personalities and presenta-
tion were the thing. Fired with nostalgia
that ranged from programmes called
“Yours for the Asking” to “The Vil-
lage Glee Club”, I waited for the set to
warm up (“Much Binding”) and prepar-
ed to listen to the men of the New
Breed. The set crackled and a voice came
through the static, proclaiming, “Come,
come, (tap, tap) we are here, I believe,
to do justice to certain composers, and
not (tap, tap) to gossip.” The years fell
away. Surely that was the voice of Mr
Crump or Chump of the Village Glee
Club? Or if not, his son. or grandson?
/Consulting my Radio Guide, I found
that it was indeed the Village Glee
Club, ambling firmly in orbit in an age
when the name was more likely to create
visions of the hundred gleeless local
developments called “The Village” than
any concept of Ye Olde English Village.
Flipping through the pages it was evident
that Eric Child still presented recorded
jazz, someone unnamed did show biz,
and there were still programmes called
Hospital Half Hour, Yours for the Ask-
ing. Highlights From Opera, Afternoon
Concert, Blue Hills. Pianophonics, and
Stereophony. There was some new-
fangled show called Teenage Jamboree,
but otherwise where was the change?
However, the key word was “presenta-
tion” and in most areas of radio this
means the style in which a named
personality presents a session. It would
not be possible for anyone to mistake,
for instance. Terry Dear's radio show
for Brian Henderson's, although both
function on the same wavelength. After
hours of careful listening to the ABC's
First Network, I was uncertain as to how
many announcers I had heard. Or was it
the same one working a long shift?
Names? I heard none. In three hours
any striving commercial announcer would-
have spoken his name from 36 to 72
times, or much more often than the
human ear can tolerate the same name
buzzing in it. But it is just as annoying
not to know who is talking to you.
So far, it appears that the ABC's first
area of attack will be in the evening pro-

DALE MILLER
OPERA
The Umpteenth
Traviata
La Traviata. Verdi. Her Majesty’s Theatre,
Melbourne.
Three hits out of four is a good average
for any opera company, especially for one
which has neither a past nor a future,
but there could be no mistaking the roar-
ing welcome which a capacity house gave
to the umpteenth Traviata to reach the
Australian stage. And no wonder, for
we are not likely to see or hear a better
production for many a long year.
Nevertheless, a Sutherland opera
must be judged by Sutherland standards,
and, while this Traviata is a definite
success, the first performance was not,
perhaps, quite as good as we may find
later ones. As it is, the sets and costumes
are the best Tonina Dorati has yet pro-
duced for us, and Norman Ayrton’s
production moves well, dramatically and
pictorially, only the impossible gypsies
letting him down.
With three first-class principals and a
good conductor it is surprising that
qualifications must be made about the
first night, but facts must be faced. After
a brilliant Drinking Song by all con-
cerned, Miss Sutherland gave us what
can only be described as a sloppy “Ah,
fors e lui”, followed by a brilliant
“Sempre libera” featuring Variations on
a Theme by Sutherland which might
have surprised, though possibly pleased,
Verdi.
Her second act was superb, the third
almost as good, but the last failed
dramatically, in spite of a moving close
which showed what a really good actress
she now is. Miss Sutherland is neither
vocally nor physically a suitable candi-
date for pulmonary consumption and a
little suitable make-up would have gone
a long way towards dramatic realism.
Luciano Pavarotti sang “Di miei
bollenti spiriti” and most of.the rest of
his part superlatively well, but his voice
did not take easily to the tessitura of
“Un di felice” and the interpolations
during “Sempre libera”. Cornelius
Opthof actually brought Germont pere to
life, no mean achievement, and his con-
tribution towards the success of the
second act was substantial. It was good
also to have the tenor-baritone duet
which ends this act restored, although
(like Alfredo’s cabaletta ) it belongs
musically to II Trovatore, written at the
same time but finished first. Verdi was a
fine dramatist and this usually omitted
ending is essential to the continuity of
the action.
In minor roles Monica Sinclair and
Clifford Grant stood out. (I can’t wait
to hear Miss Sinclair in a really meaty
part.) Richard Bonynge, as usual, kept
the action moving briskly so that our
attention was never tempted to wander.
Adelio Zagonara tried to achieve equal
prominence with the principals, among
whom he appeared not so long ago, but
he really must remember that prompters
should be neither seen nor heard.

Fairy floss
Harlow. Director, Gordon Douglas. Prince
Edward Theatre, Sydney.
“What was Harlow really like?” say the
challenging advertisements. You certain-
ly won’t find out from this movie.
Irving Shulman’s biography of Jean
Harlow, on which the film is supposed
to be based, probably erred on the cen-
sorious side: Shulman, though apparent-
ly unwillingly fascinated by his subject,
could allow her no virtues but ruthless
energy and an animal attraction which
she exploited both in public and private
life. He dismisses any suggestion of act-
ing ability; yet Jean Harlow had a defin-
ite, even if limited, talent for light roman-
tic comedy. But whatever Shulman’s
moral strictures, the facts of his biog-
raphy are undoubtedly closer to the truth
than this fairy-floss version, which apart
from some well-spaced lines of astring-
ent humor conforms to most of the
cliches of the unhappy - success - story
genre. There have been rumors that an
earlier, more authentic script was jetti-
soned for policy reasons. If so, the
funny bits are probably leftovers from it.
According to the film, Jean Harlow
becomes a movie extra to support her
mother and ne’er-do-well stepfather, but
quits the game because a director makes
a pass at her.
Jean’s rise to fame is slowed down by
her innate respectability. She looks sexy,
certainly, and admits to being violently
attracted by men, but is determined to

save herself for the man she loves and
will marry. This doesn’t quite sound like
the Jean Harlow I’ve heard about.
The real Harlow may not have been
admirable, but she was a real, gutsy
human being. The movie script, not help-
ed by a tepid performance by Carroll
Baker, only offers a stock cardboard cut-
out. To remove any vestiges of realism,
the writers have peopled the film wi.h
imaginary characters; only Harlow and
her parents and the unfortunate (and
possibly maligned) Paul Bern get their
rightful names.
But on the visual level, the film has
considerable interest. Joe Ruttenberg’s
photography is always worth studying
(or indeed just looking at), making the
very most of the art direction and cos-
tuming, which combine imagination and
authenticity. And there are first-class
character performances by Raf Vallone
as the stepfather, and the impeccable
Martin Balsam as a producer (who seems
to have managed to keep most of his
cynical dialogue from the original script).
“Harlow” is quite worth seeing but
except when Balsam or Vallone is in
sight, keep your ear-plugs in place.

Nostalgia
The Graeme Bell Story —1949. Graeme
Bell and his Dixieland Jazz Band.
Festival FL31642.
Just Bryce! Bryce Rohde. CBS 8P233196.
For anyone associated with the Aus-
tralian jazz scene in the early days, “The
Graeme Bell Story—l 949” is surrounded
by an aura of nostalgia that defies ob-
jectivity. Listening through this haze of
remembered good times, one is finally
forced to admit that there are crudities
here as well as kicks. It was a time when
the Australian approach to jazz was a
heady combination of fun and dedica-
tion. It was also a time when enthusiasm
often outstripped technique. With all
its shortcomings (by American stand-
ards), the Bell band had a distinctive
sound, it inspired a generation of jazz
musicians here, and even exerted con-
siderable influence abroad.
These 16 numbers were originally
broadcast over 3AW Melbourne, and
such favorites of the Revivalist reper-
toire as “Georgia Bo Bo”, “Strut Miss
Lizzie”, “Nobody’s Sweetheart” and
“Ballin’ the Jack” are given spirited
treatments, all livened by Roger Bell’s
infectious, jaunty trumpet lead. Some of
the ensemble choruses get a bit confus-
ed and, possibly due to bad recording,
the rhythm section is rather sodden, but
solos are generally rewarding.
If Graeme Bell eventually took
traditional jazz to its Australian limits,
Bryce Rohde has been for some years
the spearhead of the modern jazz move-
ment in this country. His music is a de-
velopment of the Cool school cere-
bral, impressionistic and frequently
straying some distance from accepted
jazz boundaries. “Just Bryce!” was re-
corded shortly before he left for the
United States in February and introduces
four of his recent compositions. “Came
a Ballerina” is the main work and, like
his celebrated “Corners”, it is a suite
in three movements which follows the
Lydian concept of George Russell. This
is a new approach to improvisation about
which Bryce says: “It is not a system
but rather a philosophy of tonality in
which the musician is made aware of all
tonal colors surrounding a chord or
tonal centre.”-
Charlie Munro and Syd Powell are
two of the few Australian saxophonists
technically capable of interpreting
Rohde’s demanding music, but their
playing lacks warmth and is often de-
liberately ugly in the Coltrane manner.
My own preference is for something
with more heat and beat (even vintage
Bell), but it is gratifying to hear Aus-
tralian jazzmen reach heights of
creativity and musicianship comparable
to their counterparts in the ’States.

ABC Youth Concert. Sydney Symphony
Orchestra conducted by Dean Dixon.
Soloists: June Loney, harp, and Neville
Amadio, flute.
Dean Dixon conducting Brahms is an
educational as well as an emotional
experience. These two properties emerge
from last week’s performance of the
Fourth Symphony as a direct outcome
of the process of simplication which
dominated his reading. From the gigantic
architecture of the work, Dixon created
an uncomplicated and logical sense of
order which served to expose and under-
line the essence of Brahms’ music.
The orchestra responded magnificently;
at times one felt the players were
accurately anticipating the conductor.

TO 13.K./EUROPE VIA THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
Variations in dynamics came with re-
markable fluency and confidence, the tone
(especially in the strings) was warm and
sustained, and even the French horns
managed to conquer their troubles in
intonation. Uniformity of phrasing,
always an extremely difficult quality to
achieve in an interpretation as personal
as Dixon’s, seemed to present no problem.
This admirable amount of understand-
ing between the players and the con-
ductor was the practical expression of
the lack of ambiguity to be found in the
directions. Dixon allowed the work to
gather its natural momentum while still
maintaining a definite control over the
internal balance and shape of the par-
ticular movements. By watching his
gestures and facial expressions, the
young, enthusiastic audience learned
more about this masterwork than they
would discover from study of a record-
ing or score. Perhaps the best examples
of this feature of the performance were
the andante and the final allegro
energico movements. How refreshing to
hear the slow movement approached with
an air of calm contentment rather than
through the oppressingly sombre over-
tones which are too often ascribed to
Brahms!
A strangely varied group of musical
miniatures constituted the opening half
of the programme. Of these, the Mozart
Concerto for Flute and Harp with the
orchestra’s June Loney and Neville
Amadio as soloists was by far the most
appealing, if only through its instant and
easy charm.
Amadio played with a sensiti-
vity and regard for phrasing which
showed an awareness of the flute conven-
tions of the 18th century. His generous
legato in the adagio movement was done
with flawless musicianship and taste.
Only a slight tendency towards a metallic
tone in the lower register appeared as
the single and unimportant blemish on
Miss Loney’s harp playing. The difficult
arpeggio sections of her part were
executed with a fine clarity which enabled
even the most detailed passages to pro-
ject throughout the hall. With the notable
exception of the opening tutti of the
finale, where the strings slithered pre-
cariously before catching Dixon’s far too
ambitious tempo, the orchestra accom-
panied with the necessary amount of
classical restraint.
Kokonnen’s “Sinfoni da Kamera”, for
12 string players, received its first Aus-
tralian performance as part of the first
half of the programme. Employing
rather conventional contemporary tex-
tures and techniques, the work seemed
pleasant rather than revolutionary.

BOOKS
The Turks at Gallipoli
By EK DUM
Gallipoli. Robert Rhodes James. Angus and
Robertson. 635.
The new flight of books about Gallipoli
generated by its Golden Jubilee goes to
prove that most of the early histories
were written too early.
In 50 years the heat of controversy
has cooled the leaders and p’anners
of the affair are all dead. The keepers
of the Official Secrets Act are less vigil-
ant and a vast amount of new material
about the events of April-December 1915
has come to light in diaries and other
documents
About the best of the new volumes
is Robert Rhodes James’s “Gallipoli”.
The author is a Clerk in the House of
Commons. He has the advantage of de-
tachment in that he is a civilian who
wasn’t there, but is a perceptive and
knowledgeable research worker and
analyst, and is capable of proving that
the onlooker can see most of the game.
James does little to clarify the story
of the awful muddle which put the An-
zac covering force ashore on small
beaches round Ari Burnu, facing almost
unclimbable cliffs, instead of on a broad
beach covered by a sandbank and with
plenty of room for deployment and a
straight run of comparatively open
country ahead. He fills in some detail
about the Anzac side of the tragic day
which ended so nearly in disaster both for
the covering and the main Anzac and
British forces. Where he does give clarity
to the picture is in his elucidation of the
Turkish operations to which all too little
attention has been devoted. It was
to their mistakes that we owe it that
what happened on the peninsula in the
first few days of the tragic business did
not end in utter disaster.
Yhey had the advantage. They knew
their terrain in detail. They had the ap-
proaches fortified. They had cover from
which to shoot down the exposed land-
ing forces like rabbits as, indeed, they
did the British in the Cape Helles area.
They had reserves and all Turkey to
retire into in Wellingtonian fashion. But
they bungled the whole thing.
Altogether the Turks had six divi-
sions, certainly archaically armed but
with some machine-guns and plenty of
shrapnel-firing artillery. Their men and
formations had exercised over the whole
of the terrain, knew all the gullies of
access and get-away, and were not
as the British were surmising which
were the vantage points from ancient
and inaccurate maps apparently con-
structed by the local washerwoman. The
Turks therefore had a great deal on
their side.
But they failed in two points one
major and one minor, so far as the
Anzacs were concerned. The minor one
was that their order for resisting a land-
ing was that fire should be held until the
boats touched sand and this meant the
Anzacs at Ari Burnu were under the
shelter of the adjacent cliffs before any
serious damage could be done.
The major point was that Von Sanders
expected one good major landing close
to a main military fortified objective.
Bulair, Gaba Tepe Beach, Helles and
Sedd-el-Bahr, or the tip of Asia Minor
round Kum Kale. He thought of them
all, but only as the venues of single land-
ings.
Von Sanders was awakened at dawn
on April 25 at his HQ at Gallipoli
and told of the many landings, but he
could not credit that most of these could
be more than feints and the presence
of a large naval force off Bulair at
the northern defence neck of the pen-
insula led him to believe that this was
the main attack, whereas it was the
only feint.
It took him the whole day to convince
himself that he had been wrong and
to turn back the crucial battalions that
he had been leading towards Bulair away
from the point at which they were most
needed and where their presence might
have decided the day.
Kemal Pasha, the future Ataturk,
down at Boghali was out of luck at first.
The 27th Regiment had actually been
doing an exercise all night in the region
of Gaba Tepe and had gone to camp
before dawn absolutely worn out. He
was a seasoned soldier, if not a very
good one. He wasted no time when he
heard of the Ari Burnu attack. He start-
ed the whole of his division on the
march towards the frontal area of Gaba
Tepe. Then he rode off at the head of
the 57th Regiment to Koja Chemen
Tepe. the highest of the three summits
of Sari Bair Ridge.
There he rested his men and w'ent for-
ward with some officers until from the
Chunuk Bair crest they could see the
warships and transports off Ari Burnu,
but no signs of fighting until they came
in view of the land sloped gently down
towards Gaba Tepe from Battleship Hill,
and about five miles from the sea. Pres-
ently he met some of his own men
running away.
“Why are you running away?” he ask-
ed. “Effendi, the enemy . . . over
there ... we have no ammunition!" So
he made them fix bayonets and lie down.
The Australians were coming on, but
when the Turks lay down they too lay
down, naturally believing that they were
about to face a fusillade.
Wrote Kemal: “The moment of time
we needed and gained” (for his party
seemed now to be isolated) “was this
one . . .” It was about 10 a.m. when the
KEMAL PASHA
57th Regiment (which he had ordered to
hurry forward) “began its attack.”
Within minutes some of the Anzacs
who had been smoking and eating in the
sun as if on a picnic were assailed by
Turks in thousands the Turkish regi-
ment was about equivalent to an Aus-
tralian brigade.
Kemal made no mistake about the
force of his attack. There had been noth-
ing like it for nearly a century.
Baby Hill 700 changed hands no fewer
than five times. By the end of the after-
noon the whole of the 19th Division had
been thrown in and the Australians and
New Zealanders had been reduced to the
remnants of seven battalions, all mixed
up and without their own known officers.
And still the Turks came on. Cut down
in swathes, as they charged with their
archaic weapons, fresh swathes appeared
until the Anzacs tired in the process of
killing them.
Around the middle of daylight the
Anzacs had a probable three-to-one
superiority in numbers, but the Turks
had the advantage in knowledge and
mobility, and access to reserves.
By late in the afternoon the Anzacs
had suffered over 2000 casualties, but
they were clinging to the earth and rock
of Gallipoli. Their ability to do this was
due as much as anything to two factors.
Kemal Pasha was a bull-at-a-gate


soldier. He did not understand the art
of drawing the enemy after him and
fighting him on his own chosen ground,
a tactic which might have paid off de-
cisively from behind a clear line of slope
somewhere, with tough, daredevil men
adept wih the bayonet. But he launched
his attack along the whole Anzac front
that afternoon in broken ground which
denied him cohesion through poor com-
munications and separation of units.
Yet he continued to drive his men on
in attacks which were suicidal for the
Turkish side and bloodily exhausting on
that of our men.
It was all thoroughly raw and unskil-
led. As Birdwood wrote: “If only Von
Sanders (but it was really Kemal) had
attacked one point of my trenches with
his whole force he must have got
through.” And then the story of Anzac
would have possibly ended on that ter-
rible evening when the simple, dazed
and weary Anzacs believed that no bat-
tle could be worse or more bloody, and
had yet to learn through Krithia, and all
that came after, how little they knew of
the horrors of war.
In the first six days of Gallipoli the
Anzac Corps had 6554 casualties of
which 1252 had been killed (25 per
cent). One battalion had lost more than
half its strength, thanks to Kemal’s head-
long bull-at-a-gate methods which he re-
peated on May 1. He thought the Anzac
morale had “completely broken down”,
and launched his screaming hordes
against them in dense masses. The Aus-
tralian losses were, however, small com-
pared to those of the Turks whose esti-
mate was that on the Anzac front 14,000
of their soldiers had been killed or died
of wounds in those same six days.
It was at this stage that Von Sanders
(or Essad Pasha) stepped forward and
gave the order to dig in, which Kemal
himself accepted.
And so to the “holding era” with all
its bitter fighting and ultimate retreat
when Anzac “had moulded itself into a
vast human ant heap”.
But it was not altogether in vain, for
it tied up in a crucial period, or immolat-
ed, a very substantial Turkish force.
Its effect on Turkish morale was tre-
mendous. Whole villages lost their men
before, eight-and-a-half months later, the
adventure ended with wholesale frost-
bite added to all the other horrors.
No strictly accurate record of casu-
alties has ever been agreed on. British
and Dominion killed, wounded or
missing were about 215,000, the French
another 50,000. Nearly 50,000 Allied
soldiers were killed or died of illness.
The Turks lost at least 300.000.
Three years afterwards the British re-
turned to Gallipoli as victors.
Genius or Parish Priest?
By DESMOND O’GRADY
Pope John and His Revolution. E. E. Y.
Hales. Eyre and Spottiswoode.
Was Pope John a geopolitical genius as
Robert Kaiser claimed or was he merely
a simple parish priest who won sym-
pathy because he maintained his natural
style while Pope? The English historian
of the Papacy, E. E. Y. Hales, steers
between these contrasting versions of
John XXIII to arrive at a complex esti-
mate. John's “Journal of a Soul” reveals
that his personal style was only a by-
product of an unremitting struggle against
his defects, but the same Journal shows
that he was something less than a genius
in the ordinary sense of the word.
There is a subtler interpretation of
John which has him as a charismatic
leader who said the same things as his
predecessors but made them palatable.
This makes John not so much an original
spiritual leader as an inspired public rela-
tions man. Hales counters this interpreta-
tion by contrasting John’s acceptance of
the modern world with his predecessors’
constant reproofs of it. They steadily de-
nounced the errors which kept men from
the Church, but one had to accept their
premises to endorse their conclusions.
John, however, took the attitude that, as
Christ’s vicar, all men’s concerns were
his own. Whereas his predecessors
saw the world’s troubles as consequences
of historical and philosophical errors,
John pragmatically suggested that men
co-operate for aims, such as peace and
unity, which would never be constructed
by even the most perfect syllogisms.
John’s appealing personality served to
convey a vision which was new, at least
in the history of the modern Papacy.
This vision shaped his two major ency-
clicals, “Mater et Magistra” and “Pacem
in Terris”, which completely abandoned
the admonitory tone maintained from
Pius IX to Pius XII. But it is not merely
a question of tone, for, as Hale points
out, even his immediate predecessors
would have regarded John’s invitation to
the State to provide for men as an in-
fringement of men’s personal liberties.
Pius XII was suspicious of communal
kitchens, free health services and free
education but John welcomed the wel-
fare State. At the same time as he
acknowledged a new concept of the
duties of the State he made claims for
the rights of conscience unprecedented
in Papal teaching.
The Church’s unity is in its faith and
not in its social encyclicals. John’s socio-
logy was a-radical development on pre-
vious Papal teaching, although it can
claim philosophical kinship with that of
Leo XIII through being based on the
human person. Most of the innovation, of
course, was due to his fostering new ideas
such as those regarding aid for under-
developed countries, world unity and
colonialism, whereas Hales ably shows
that even Leo XIII, the source of the
Church’s modern social teaching, was
well behind his age.
But, if comparisons with previous
Popes are necessary to place John, the
most obvious comparison is with Pius
XII. Whatever one thinks of Hochhuth’s
criticism of Pius XII, it implies that the
Pope shall act as the spiritual father of
all men. John convinced men that his
interests were catholic, which accounts
for his particular popularity in the Pro-
testant world. There was no danger of
his making a religion of democracy but
it was obviously congenial to him. This
distinguished him on the practical plane
from Pius XII, whose political assess-
ments were vitiated by underestimation
of the strength and temper of the Anglo-
Saxon democracies. A further striking
difference between them was their re-
sponse to the world’s expectations of the
Church. Hales points to the Holy Year as
the high water mark of Pius’ pontificate.
The Pope spoke of the lead it would give
mankind, but it culminated in the an-
nouncement of the dogma of the Assump-
tion which Pius said “will greatly help
towards the advance of society”. The
Council was to be the high-water mark
of John’s pontificate and, as well as its
internal aims regarding the Church, he
stressed that it should contribute to jus-
tice, security and peace for all men.
Hales’ lucid study has the historical
perspective which enables him to show
that John was not a bolt from the blue,
while bringing out his originality. Hales’
most illuminating judgments are that
John endorsed the attitudes taken by
19th-century French Catholic liberals
such as Montalembert and Lacordaire,
and that in the historical order he was the
heir not of Pius IX but of Mazzini.


The American Dream
By DAVID MARTIN
A Nation of Immigrants. John F. Kennedy.
Hamish Hamilton. 19s.
President Kennedy first published this
book in 1958 as a contribution to the still
unfinished fight for the liberalisation of
American immigration laws. It is a
workmanlike and unambitious record of
what immigrants have done for the
United States and what it has done for
them. It documents the restrictions they
have had to battle against.
Unrhetorically but with conviction, it
addresses itself to the task of creating a
better understanding of the problem.
JFK was opposed to the principle,
which is basic to American policy, that
the internal national balance must be
kept stable, meaning that there should be
no drastic changes in the ethnic mixture.
This is, of course, the same principle that
underlies official Australian attitudes.
Indeed, America still has its partial
equivalent of the White Australia policy
in the special discriminatory formula
which applies to the “Asian-Pacific Tri-
angle”, an area extending from Pakistan
to Japan above a line north of Australia
and New Zealand.
The first chapters offer a brief analy-
sis of the various waves of immigration.
They contain nothing not readily avail-
able from other sources, being mainly an
attempt to prove how right Alexis de
Tocqueville was in his estimate that no
territorial aristocracy could be raised
from the ranks of fugitives from poverty
and persecution. He came too early to
foresee clearly the democratic revolution
they would bring about; a revolution
destined to develop characteristics that
made it exclusive and unexportable. This
section is the most forthrightly propa-
in that it was written to dis-
arm contemporary prejudices. It makes
much of the point that it was physical
misery which prevented many immigrants
from Southern and Eastern Europe from
settling in the interior: they simply
lacked the means of penetrating beyond
the Atlantic shore. A few odd figures
are interesting to foreigners, who may
not know, for instance, how strong the
Scandinavian element is, including 1.3
million Swedes.
The cruel anomalies of the quota
system are among matters dealt with in
the second part. If you are a German
you may be admitted almost at once, if
a Greek there will be nearly 100,000
candidates ahead of you, to be let in at
the rate of 308 annually. A reading list,
an elementary chronology and a few
speeches that leave no doubt where
Kennedy stood round off the volume,
which boasts a pictorial middle-piece,
complete with a horrific reproduction of
the deck plan of an 18th-century British
slave ship trading to Virginia.
Kennedy strove for immigration re-
form, but much has yet to be done.
Improvements sometimes remain on
paper. This is again shown by the fate
of seasonal workers from Mexico, and
the exploitation against which they are-
still not secure.
Literary Politics
SIR. —It’s a bit rough on Australians
that we should export our literary
differences but since Maurice Shad-
bolt’s review of Frank Sargeson’s “Col-
lected Stories, 1935-63” (8., June 19),
was neither fair nor disinterested,
your readers are entitled to another
view.
Mr Shadbolt says that “Collected
Stories” suffers from the lack of a
tough-minded editor. I am willing to
concede that I think some of the
stories better than others, but I am not
so vain as to think that my choice
would be better than that of others
who admire Sargeson. Before any
selection can fairly be made, it must
be done openly in the light of a full
collection including stories long out of
print. If the author had been willing, I
would have included the ten or so
brief sketches that are omitted.
Your readers may have been struck
by the contradiction in Mr Shadbolt’s
review: if Sargeson’s achievement is so
minor, how does Mr Shadbolt justify
his importance in our writing? He said
himself, taking a literary prize two
years ago, that it should have gone to
Sargeson, “without whom the New
Zealand short story would not have
been possible”. Some of his own earli-
est published stories offer Mr Sargeson
the compliment of imitation. I have
followed Mr Shadbolt’s criticism for
some time and, though the strategies
change and there have been noticeable
fluctuations in his assessment of some
writers, the tenets are the same: That
the best New Zealand writing at pre-
sent is not in verse but in fiction,
which reached maturity with lan Cross
in 1958. Praise in London or New
York is a better test of merit than
praise in one’s own country and de-
monstrates that the writers of fiction
who have appeared since 1958 (except
me) are infinitely better than their pre-
decessors of the ’thirties and ’forties.
All of these dogmas are consistent
with the assumption that the greatest
thing that has happened to New Zea-
land writing though the country is
not mature enough to see it, cursed
as it is with academics like me is the
appearance of lan Cross and Maurice
Shadbolt. It is no exaggeration to
say that much of Mr Shadbolt’s critic-
ism is directed at demolishing obstacles
to this assumption. Mr Sargeson’s
reputation and his stubborn vitality in
the ’sixties, when he so clearly belongs
to the 'thirties, is such an obstacle.
If Mr Shadbolt can see Sargeson as
our Grand Old Man it is not a posi-
tion that Mr Sargeson has ever sought.
It would be fair repartee to say that
Mr Shadbolt has sometimes given the
impression of wanting to appoint and
lead a literary government in spiritual
exile; in his review of the local scene
in your issue of October 10, one could
see the GOM selecting (or reshuf-
fling) his shadow cabinet.

A Debt
I come on the debt again this day in
November
It is raining into the yellow trees
The night kept raising white birds
The fowls of darkness entering winter
But I think of you seldom
You lost nothing you need entering death
I tell you the basket has woven itself
over you
If there was grief it was in pencil on a
wall
At no time had I asked you for anything
What did you take from me that I still
owe you
Each time it is
A blind man opening his eyes
It is a true debt it can never be paid
How have you helped me
Is it with speech you that combed out
your voice till the ends bled
Is it with hearing with waking of any
kind
You in the wet veil that you chose it is
not with memory
Not with sight of any kind not
Yet
It is a true debt it is mine alone
It is nameless
It rises from poverty
It goes out from me into the trees
Night falls
It follows a death like a candle
But the death is not yours.

A Poor Man’s “War and Peace”?
By R. G. HOWARD
The Ring in Meiji. William Butler. Peter
Owen. 445. 6d.
With, apparently, something like an up-
dated “War and Peace” in view, William
Butler has set his fifth novel, of personal
and national upheaval, in nineteenth-
century Japan, the period when the old
feudalists society was being shaken by
Western sophistication. He falls, it must
be admitted, considerably short of Tol-
stoy but “The Ring in Meiji” is never-
theless an impressive book. There are a
huge number of characters as many
as in the model though it is only about a
third the latter's size. One very signifi-
cant factor in the book's overall failure
is this relative brevity. There is simply
not enough space to deal adequately with
either level of the story. The public events
are very dimly perceived, though this
could be due to the paucity of historical
records. Certainly we never really get to
know any of the characters. While the
abrupt, restless shifts from one develop-
ment to another are more suited to the
background of turmoil and change than
the sweeping pace of Tolstoy, there is the
disadvantage that this allows only super-
ficial penetration of the various lives in-
volved.
The book has its Pierre, passively ac-
cepting the pleasures of life until shock-
ed into asking questions, in the Ameri-
can lad Ken Manke adopted by a fake
doctor whose left hand is lopped off by
one of Japan's more uncompromising
nationalists. The brother of this ferocious
warlord, Shimizu Matate, has a role not
unlike that of Tolstoy's Prince Andrew.
Instinctively rejecting his brother's
bloody solution to the country’s prob-
lems he undertakes a painful, conscien-
tious search for the real one. He wanders
through Japan to discover the people’s
ideas (one section among many that, de-
scribed in a few skimpy paragraphs, ob-
viously called for more detailed account),
joins up with a group of radicals led by
an insufferable Frenchman who knows
all the answers and financed by Ken
Manke made rich by Government com-
pensation for his foster-father's barbar-
ous reception. Shimizu and Manke have
already become friends since the time
the former gave his services to the doc-
tor as personal compensation for his
brother’s inhospitality. This action in-
furiates the impetuous warlord and gives
rise, half way through the book, to what
seems like a wholesale slaughter of the
characters the novel's bloodiest though
not its most shocking sequence.
It is not an easy book to read a
large number of characters with un-
familiar Japanese names are rapidly in-
troduced and it is not until nearly half-
way through that one begins to recog-
nise them. The publishers would have
done well to follow the practice adopted
for Russian novels and start with a list
of the characters and their relationships.
To add to the difficulty Butler never ex-
plains various ranks such as bushi, eta,
Shogun, etc., so that a glossary would
also have been helpful.
But the characters for all that they
are lacking in depth, lack nothing in
vividness. Butler is good at creating at-
mosphere and the background seems re-
markably authentic. “The Ring in Meiji”
is absorbing through all its many pages
and its complexity is such that a second
reading would certainly give one a bet-
ter understanding, and perhaps an even
better opinion, of it.
The Sceptic
I tried to believe in magic
But found myself stuck with facts.
It isn’t only a matter of faith; quite
early
I grew accustomed to gaining second-
best,
Being pipped at the post
By the gay charmer, the long-muscled
loper
Breasting the finish with plenty of breath
in hand.
For years I fought against it as though
A destiny is something one can choose;
And in that sneaking part of the mind
That feeds on superstitions, prayed
For Aladdin’s lamp or at least
Three thoughtful wishes
To change my life or win a lottery.
And then one morning it seemed I awoke
and knew
That I was not one of the chosen grubs
To glut in a glasshouse heaven.
The day
Fell into place. I knew I would have to
cope
Without the magic agent; there was no
reason
To even believe all the tones of grey,
Presents, or pittances;
All meant no more than themselves.
“I am not sorry,” I said, and laughed in
that street
Where somebody’s stone spire stood up
and tried
Hand over granite hand to make it
Up into the heavenly hopes of so hope-
lessly many.
LOUIS JOHNSON


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The General Huffs Again
that he will be re-elected
and safe in the knowledge that
France, with its low farm prices, needs
the Common Market less than the other
five partners, General de Gaulle doubt-
less believes he has the political edge
in his latest boycotting move. By being
unco-operative, France hopes to gain
more of a say in running the Common
Market.
Despite all the advantages gained from
54 years of the Economic Community,
Europe now is back to taws, arguing
about the best means of achieving an
integrated Europe, with some even
suggesting that the Treaty of Rome must
be revised and Britain brought into the
union.
De Gaulle is contemptuous. He kept
Britain out before and believes he can
do it again, if only those stupid Dutch,
Germans and Italians would realise that
the only way to build a united Europe
is with Gaullist building blocks.
There is no doubt that de Gaulle has
won many political skirmishes, yet even
Charles has been forced to admit he has
been unable to knock Germany into line.
By walking out of the Brussels con-
ference and withdrawing its ambassador
to the European Economic Community,
the French Government threw the EEC
members into a tizzy. They can’t ne-
gotiate an agricultura l policy without
France, because half of France’s exter-
nal trade is with the EEC. The prices
of French farm products are generally
low'er than those of other EEC mem-
bers, though France has agreed to bring
these prices progressively up to the aver-
age level under a common agricultural
policy which is designed to impose tar-
iffs on outside imports and subsidise ex-
portable surpluses. w'h f .re necessary.
As France had insisted that the in-
creased level of farm prices would in-
duce inflation, she required a financial
agreement whereby EEC members w'ould
pay part of the cost.
Using this financial requirement as a
lever, the European Commission pressed
France to recognise greater powers for
the Commission and majority voting in
the Council of Ministers. This was re-
garded in Europe as a tactical error,
because qualified majority voting in the
Council of Ministers was scheduled to
be introduced anyway in January, 1966.
Regardless of what the US and UK
think, Charles looks like gaining some
concessions again in European domestic
affairs. Internationally there are broader
issues to be settled on NATO and cur-
rency reforms.
The latest news from Brussels pro-
claims that the Common Market’s com-
missioners have evolved a “formula” to
cut through the agricultural hiatus and
to satisfy France. It appears, for the
time being, that silence on the details
is “the best service (the commissioners)
can render Europe”.
On any count they need hardly expect
France to cease using EEC economics to
provoke wider political developments.
The aims were recently spelled out by
the French Minister for Foreign Affairs,
M. Couve de Murville: “A common
policy means a European policy. And
here you have the big word: I mean that
Europe must be European ... a Euro-
pean Europe means quite simply an
independent Europe.”
The key word there is undoubtedly
“independent” with the corollary, under
French leadership, of drawing her Euro-
pean partners away from those distress-
ing “Anglo-Saxons”.
Monetary Reform

tral banker, not a member of the inter-
national gold pool, set tongues a-wag-

the market.
France was blamed again for being in
a huff over the statement of Mr Henry
Fowler, US Secretary of the Treasury,
that the US wanted a world monetary
conference to deal with international
liquidity.
France asserts she has long shown die
lead in this currency reform field by
demanding that dollar balances shoulJ
be repaid and that a new composite
reserve unit Should be introduced which
is freely convertible.
If France gets her way, of course, it
would put increased pressure on gold
reserves. She already has created acute
British and American Share Markets
outside events are plainly
determining the shape of both
London and New York stock markets.
It cannot be said that they are in-
ducing anything but a convinced and
canny caution in either place. Not
even the resignation of Sir Alec
Douglas-Home could bring more
than brief and faint cheer to London,
which certainly found itself totally
unable to retain the relative bright-
ness of the week before.
Wall Street, naturally, is bearing
the brunt of White House indecision
on Vietnam. In the circumstances,
the only rule seems to be playing safe.
There are some analysts, however,
who still assert the market continues
to put technical consolidation before
all else. They believe, as well, that
the next positive move must be an
upswing.
Friday saw the Dow Jones show ; ts
first gain over the week, but this was
certainly insufficient to counter much
of a five-days’ 16.46 points loss.
Volumes held reasonably well, though
were still significantly below the cor-
responding week of "1964.
Leading indicators like motors, elec-
tronics and aircrafts made some up-
ward moves; chemicals, on the other
hand, traded undecidedly with mixed
results. Once again the automobile
industry appears set for a record 1965
(some experts predict a nine-million
car year), and there are even hopes
that steel will reach 'a peaceful in-
dustrial agreement by September 1.
The stage is waiting upon Vietnam.
Sir Alec gave London a slight for-
ward stimulus, yet the excitement was
speedily lowered for lack of genuine
buying pressure. Recent moves into
gold were not reversed, so industrials
recorded a further small loss on the
week.


embarrassment by insisting on certain
.dollar conversions.
Now, with the US balance of pay-
ments going the right way, America is
preparing the ground for a full-scale con-
ference of International Monetary Fund
members in 1966, if a preparatory com-
mittee this September feels time is ripe.
The general impression, however, is
that the climate is not right for monetary
reform in many quarters, particularly
with Britain’s figures still not showing
much improvement.
Independent buyers, therefore, are still
prepared to argue that gold is not a bad
hedge, despite America’s insistence that
there will be no devaluation.
Hard for Exports
Tt can scarcely be felt that the 1965-66
export season is getting away to
much of a start. Any fairly accurate
estimate of the effects of the drought is
proving hard to obtain, from official and
private sources alike; many commodity
prices look uncertain; trouble on the
wharves has already held up big cargoes
and looks extraordinarily difficult to
resolve.
Capping all this, the awaited rise in
freight charges to Europe has proved
larger than expected. The new rates
follow quickly on higher freights to
Hong Kong, Korea, China and Japan.
Not only the balance-of-payments
situation shows effects from these greater
payouts. The prices of Australian pro-
ducts on tremendously competitive over-
seas markets come into question.
A further £lO million may now be
added to the existing yearly freight bill
of some £lBO million. European freights
are actually going up by an average of
about 6.6 p.c. and apply to wool from
September 1, to refrigerated and general
cargo from October 1, and to apples and
pears from February 1, 1966. Shippers
and producers will be permitted by the
conference lines concerned “to plead
hardship in mitigation of the increase”.
Though the amount of the increase is
in accord with an agreed formula sup-
ported by the Federal Exporters’ Over-
seas Transport Committee and British
and Continental shipping groups, one
main factor in the rise stands out. Two-
fifths of an accepted shortfall in the
shipping companies’ 1964 earnings
derived from higher stevedoring costs.
The problem of vessel turn-round has
certainly come to the fore again and
looks like growing worse during the
current year. None of this should
detract from the necessity of examining
the whole process of fixing “conference”
freight rates. The process is still under
fire from most major exporting countries
and at a time when tramp rates, if high,
have been relatively stable.
CROESUS
Putting a Premium
On Prying
Life under trade practices legislation
A lthough what Mr Snedden had to
say in Melbourne on the need for
keeping the register of trade agreements
secret would probably be agreed to by
most businessmen, few would accept the
principle of registration itself. It seem-
ed to me that the Attorney-General gave
one compelling reason why they would
not. In a word, he wants the business
world to provide the authority with a
detailed picture of its trading arrange-
ments. His defence of this is that it will
save the authority from the task of pry-
ing around to get the facts for itself.
Has he stopped to think why, in fact,
the authority should have all this confi-
dential information? As he admits that
only agreements suspected of being
against the public interest will be exa-
mined, surely all that is needed is to
list the types of agreements that might
be suspect in the Bill, leaving the onus
on the public to complain to the author-
ity against any particular agreement
thought to be operating injuriously to
its interest.
If the latter system can be accepted
for most of the trade practices, as dis-
tinct from agreements, to be brought
under scrutiny, either at the instigation
of the commissioner or by public com-
plaint, it is inexplicable why it cannot
be adopted in toto, except for the pro-
scribed collusive practices. It is no de-
fence of registration of agreements to be
horrified at the thought of investigators
prying into practices of agreements under
examination by the tribunal. At some
B. M. SNEDDEN
stage or other in examining either agree-
ments or practices there will have to be
investigation. That, if I may say so, is
one of the obnoxious features of the
whole business —the creation of a quasi-
Government investigating force, which
may be accepted, say, for security pur-
poses, but which goes absolutely against
the notion of free business enterprise.
Once initiated, who knows where it will
-end? We should indeed be guarded.
There is the awful example of the acti-
vities of the Federal Trade Commission
in the US on this.
In its latest dissertation on trade prac-
tices, the Institute of Public Affairs, still
the most watchful of guardians of the
true interest of the public, underlines the
danger in this respect. “The proposed
legislation must enlarge the already sub-
stantial area of Government supervision
and interference in the economy,” it
states, “and undoubtedly introduces ah
element of busybodiness and of prying
into business transactions by people who
do not have to bear the risks and respon-
sibilities of private enterprise.” It is
something for which the likes of Mr
Snedden and Sir William Gunn, bent
on a similar build-up of bureaucracy,
should spare more than a passing
thought.
Like myself, the Institute of Public
Affairs thinks that, far from shutting its
eyes to the undoubted existence of
abuses in the trade practices field, the
Government should take a hard look
at what is happening in New Zealand
and Canada on this front, before it takes
its final steps along the chosen road of
the Trade Practices Bill. The IPA says
that “in neither of these two countries
are businessmen required to comply
with an unwieldly procedure necessita-
ting the registration of a mass of trade
practices covered by the legislation.
Action by the Government against a
practice originates in a complaint by a
member of the public or in a decision of
the authorities concerned with the ad-
ministration of the laws. Several years
ago the NZ Government abandoned
the system of registration. The NZ
authorities, instead, satisfy themselves
that a complaint has substance before
proceeding against suspected offenders”.
The Institute believes that no right-
thinking person could take exception to
legislation which would discourage seri-

ous abuses and provide members of the
public with ready access to machinery
for rectliying legitimate grievances. It
is against more far-reaching attempts,
as in the Snedden legislation, to enforce
rigorous competition in the community.
Similar attempts on the latter lines in
the United States and Britain have fallen
foul of the difficulty of compelling
people to act in ways they think are
opposed to their own best interests. Say-
ing that the legislation in Britain was
introduced because it was held that
industry had become flabby and unen-
terprising through lack of competition
arising, inter alia, from the widespread
existence of restrictive business practices,
the IPA cites an authoritative finding in
two-thirds of the 238 agreements exa-
mined by the authority. Both prices and
the degree of competition had been
much the same as if the agreements had
continued. Further, it says that “experts
who have examined the impact of the
trade laws on the British economy are,
almost without exception, reluctant to
come to definite conclusions about its
broad economic effects”. Equally it
thinks that “those who imagine that
legislation of this nature will somehow
effect a rapid or radical transformation
in the Australian economy seem likely
to be sadly disillusioned”.
The IPA sees several difficulties like-
ly to impede the effectiveness of the
Snedden legislation. One is the more
obvious snag of getting complementary
legislation enacted in the States. Another
is that, if the experience in Britain is
any guide, the abandonment of forma!
agreements ma\ frequently lead to their
replacement by informal arrangements
of various kinds tending to achieve the
same result Thirdly, there is the above-
mentioned difficulty of getting people to
do something against their best interests.
Then, the IPA stresses. Australia is a
very different kettle of fish to either
Britain or the US. in that the market here
is very thin and the economy generally
is passing through a crucial stage of
development.
These observat'ons on the size of the
market and its relationship to the size
of firms and competition pinpoint a
weakness in the structure of the local
economy, which could well be aggravated
by the new legislation. With a thin
market here, important economies of
scale are more difficult to achieve than
in the US and Britain. In many fields
monopolistic or at least semi-monopolis-
tic organisations are unavoidable. It is
simply unrealistic to expect private capi-
tal to risk large sums of money on the
basic and important modern growth in-
dustries without some degree of certainty-
in the marketing and disposal of pro-
ducts.
However, the argument is not all one
way. The difficulty is to strike a fair
balance between competition and what
is best for the individual firm. On the
one hand, by introducing a strong ele-
ment of uncertainty about sales pros-
pects. competition provides an important
stimulus to technical improvement and
progress. Equally, if intensive compe-
tition plagues firms faced with too much
uncertainty about their marketing pros-
pects. they will be less willing to undergo
the heavy capital expenditure, costly
research, long-range planning and deve-
lopment required to achieve the neces-
sary economies of scale.
1 keep on remembering J. A. Schum-
peter's summing-up on the ingredients of
progress in his “Capitalism, Socialism
and Democracy". “As soon as we go
into the details and inquire into the in-
dividual items in which progress was
most conspicuous,” he stated, "the trail
leads not to the doors of those firms
that work under conditions of compara-
tively free competition but precisely to
the doors of the large concerns and a
shocking suspicion dawns upon us that
big'business may have had more to do
with creating that standard of life than
keeping it down.” In stricf economic,
though possibly not social, terms, that
is right.
Apparently the ACTU doesn't see it.
Yet the trade unions, which have got
more out of togetherness both in busi-
ness and in their own movement than
any other interest in this country, con-
tinue to taunt the Government (last week,
at the economic talks in Canberra) for
watering down the trade practices legis-
lation. “We urge that you firmly reject
any proposal put by the business com-
munity to emasculate further what is
already a relatively anaemic Bill,” their
written submission stated, without a
thought of the cap fitting them. Apropos
of that, while the IPA stops short of
recommending legislative action against
restrictive practices imposed by trade
unions, it quotes a British economist as
saying that the returns to the economy
from efforts to diminish labor-restrictive
practices may be larger than the returns
from further efforts against business
practices and that “at least the likelihood
should be examined”. What an outcry
there would be here if Mr McMahon
had a similar idea. Mr Snedden's Bill
is bad enough.

A Pattern for Rural Research
Help for the Hunter Valley Foundation
Resting time came last week for the
nine - year - old Hunter Valley
Research Foundation. While councils,
commerce and industry in Newcastle
and in the valley had always provided
the bulk of the finance, the organisa-
tion had the encouragement that came
annually in the form of a steadily
increasing grant from the State Govern-
ment. Last year the State Treasury con-
tributed £20,000, mostly under an agree-
ment that provided £3 subsidy for every
£5 raised by the community. The Labor
Government backed the Foundation so
solidly since the days when Mr Cahill
was Premier that, not unexpectedly
in some quarters, it became regarded
as a Labor undertaking.
The new Premier (Mr Askin) has now
put the Foundation above the level of
politics by giving an assurance to the
255 who attended its annual dinner that
the rate of subsidy would be maintained
and his Government would provide
even more help. It' would be prepared,
he said, to give the Foundation a rent-
free Sydney office alongside the new
premises of the Ministry for Decentralisa-
tion and Development. The Sydney
office will provide an outlet for the
wealth of information on the Hunter
region that Foundation research has
built up over the years. Among the
dividends will be a greater recognition
of the potential of ten square miles of
ideal industrial land being reclaimed by
the Public Works Department with the
use of silt from the lower reaches of
the Hunter River.
Today the Hunter Valley is the best
instrumented area in Australia and the
Foundation sets a pattern which must
eventually be adopted on a national
scale. The annual report of the Founda-
tion describes it as an expression of
the determination of the citizens of the
valley to bring knowledge gained from
scientific research to the solution of the
problems they face in bringing the
resources of the valley to full develop-
ment. Last year citizens and Govern-
ment backed that expression to the
extent of £57,200. They maintained an
association unique in Australia, one in
which citizens and scientists worked
together for the solution of a region's
problems.
The Foundation has its own head-
quarters in the Newcastle suburb of
Mayfield. The staff of 24 includes 14
science graduates and four technical
officers working in the field. The director
of research is 43-year-old economist
Professor Cyril Renwick, the son of a
clergyman and former staff member of
the Newcastle University College.
Control comes from 14 city and district
directors, working in an honorary
capacity. Activities cover water and land
use, economic growth and development,
and the prospects for further invest-
ment.
In compiling information on New-
castle and the Hunter River Valley, the
FRANK FINNAN
Foundation started behind scratch, since
much of the early data available to it
was found to be inaccurate. Officers
had to comb the available material,
thoroughly checking it against the out-
come of their own investigation. Much
basic information on people and their
interests was obtained by circulating
questionnaire forms. A mass of scien-
tific instruments in the field is used to
check rainfall, stream flow and the
ability of different parts ctf the valley
to retain rainwater. An extensive pro-
gramme is still proceeding to track the
movement of silt in Newcastle Harbor
and so assist in minimising the terrific
cost of constant dredging. Higher up
the valley the Foundation has planted
willows along the course of streams to
hold the rich silt in the area where it
can be an asset to agriculture. But the
real value of all this work is in the
result of research that comes from such
experiments.
Although the research is still in an
early stage, it has already revealed great
waste waste of manpower where it
is misplaced on unsuitable projects;
waste of millions of tons of rich soil
carried down into the sea in flood time,
and waste of the water so badly needed,
as in the present drought.
The pattern of waste in the Hunter
Valley is no different from that which
is going on without serious investiga-
tion in many other parts of the contin-
ent. Professor Renwick emphasised the
need for water research when he
addressed the annual dinner. He went so
far as to say that, if the pattern set
by the Foundation did not grow quickly
into a nation-wide effort, the nation’s
future could be in jeopardy. The time
had passed, he said, when the search
for water, the study of its occurrence
and quality could be a haphazard, back-
woods type of activity. Public and pri-
vate enterprise had to go after water
as they had gone after other natural
resources such as oil, coal, iron ore,
bauxite, timber and gold all of which
were vital at some stage of our growth.
The idea that produced the organisa-
tion was born out of the havoc and
desolation which followed the record
1955 flood in the Hunter Valley. Over
a cup of coffee a former Newcastle
journalist, Mr Leo Butler, of Melbourne,
asked Mr Allen Fairhall, MP (now the
Minister for Supply), “What are we
going to do about it?” It wasn’t long
after that, on April 5, 1955, that a
hostile meeting of 600 dairy farmers
at Maitland asked the same question
and demanded an answer from the Gov-
ernment. The petition they all signed

Middlemen in Job Provision
The role of employment agencies
TI/hat does an Australian businessman
do when one of his secretaries goes
off sick, or resigns, or takes her holidays
just when the workload increases? What
does he do at the end of the financial
year when the balance sheet has to be
prepared, the group certificates have r o
be made out and there is not enough
staff? The answer is, increasingly, call
on an employment agency.
Today Australian business is relying
less and less on personal selection and
calling more and more on the services
of employment agencies for office staff,
both temporary and permanent, and
even for technically skilled workers (such
as engineers and draftsmen). By using
the agencies business is saving itself the
cost of advertising the vacancies and time
and money in interviewing a large num-
ber of applicants, none of whom may
be the right person for the job.
Indeed the employment agency busi-
ness has grown so fast in recent years
that the agencies themselves almost
dominate the “Positions Vacant” columns
in the daily newspapers. Agencies The
Bulletin spoke to said the day was not
far off when they would be the news-,
papers’ best and possibly only “Positions
Vacant” customers. Such a situation has
already occurred in Britain where, save
for higher appointments at executive
level, almost all of the jobs advertised
come from agencies. The same applies
in some American cities.
The employment agency is not a new
concept in Australia. The oldest and
largest, the Commonwealth Employment
Service, has been operating for many
years. But many of the private enter-
prise agencies are fairly recent. In
Sydney alone there are more than 50
employment agencies with facilities for
supplying staff anywhere in the metro-
politan.. area. The numbers grow each
year, making the already fierce com-
petition even tougher.
Most of the private employment
agencies deal solely with office staff.
There are specialised agencies, such as
the AHA (The Australian Hotels’ Asso-
ciation), which supplies hotel staff. None,
however, is as broad in concept as the
Commonwealth Employment Service,
supplying anyone from laborers to top-
flight executives and placing special
emphasis on finding employment for
physically handicapped workers.
Last year the Commonwealth Employ-
ment Service filled almost 450,000 of the
671,000 job vacancies it had. Another
feature of its work is the job instruction
given to teenagers about to leave school.
Last year it took 12,000 school pupils
in NSW on job tours, enabling them to
see what steelwork or architecture or
university work entailed. It provides a
vocational guidance service in all States
except NSW, where this is a State
Government responsibility.
With the present full employment
situation, the Commonwealth Employ-
ment Service sometimes finds itself hard
put to supply the demand for workers.
At the moment, for instance, there are
12 vacancies for metal workers for every
metal tradesman applicant. Full employ-
ment is reflected in the “awaiting place-
ment” figures for June, 1961 and 1965.
In June, 1961 (roughly the height of the
credit squeeze), there were 80,000 job
applicants on the books. In June this
year there were only 42,000.
A noticeable characteristic of employ-
ment in Australia is the growing number
of married women, with families able to
look after themselves, who are looking
for jobs. One private agency said the?
number of such women was growing
each month. “Sometimes their search
for employment is necessitated by
financial troubles, but we get a lot of
women who just want a job to fill in
their time now that they have their
children off their hands.”
Unlike the Commonwealth Employ-
ment Agency, the private agencies charge
for their services. In the case of per-
manent staff the client pays only once
for each vacancy the agency fills. With
temporary staff the client pays a fee,
in addition to wages for the term of
employment. In some cases the client
pays the agency direct and it, after
deducting charges and items like tax,
pays the worker. In other cases the client
pays the worker directly and the agency
fee separately.
Charges vary widely from agency to
agency. Generally speaking the follow-
ing rates are representative: For tempor-
ary staff the charges may be 255. a day
plus wages up to 455. a week plus wages.
For the placement of permanent staff
the basis of charges varies. One agency
charges 9 guineas for female staff 15
or 16 years old, 12 guineas from 17 to
20 years, and 15 guineas for 21 and over.
For permanent male staff the same
agency charges on a salary basis. On a
salary to £lOOO, a charge of £2O is made.
To £1250 the charge is £25 and over
£1250, £3O. This charge is made once
only. Another agency, for permanent
senior male staff, charges 17 guineas and
for permanent female staff, 15 guineas.
It charges 12 guineas for those whose
weekly salary is below that amount.
One of the largest office staff agencies
in Sydney, and possibly Australia, is
Centacom, which from small beginnings
eight years ago (it claims to be the first
office staff employment agency in
Sydney) last year reached its peak place-
ment of. about 8000. In the last three
years it has filled 24,320 jobs and in
that period has increased its placement
by 1000 a year (i.e., 6000 in 1962-63,
7000 in 1963-64, 8000 in 1964-65).
The manageress of Centacom, Miss
C. Martyn, said the work of agencies was
growing because of a realisation by busi-
ness of the time and money saving
benefits agencies had to offer. “The

agencies are also being used more by
office workers who can save themselves
a lot of time looking for a job by going
to an agency,” she said.
Miss Martyn said there was a notable
change in the growth of the number of
suburban jobs being registered with
Centacom. “As business moves away
from the city to the suburbs we are
getting a lot more extra-city jobs to fill.
It seems to be a general trend, too, that
salaries paid in the suburbs are higher
than those in the cities, possibly as an
incentive for the worker to go to the
suburbs and in order to compensate for
the lesser shopping facilities.”
Two relative newcomers to the em-
ployment agency business in Australia
are offshoots of foreign concerns. Brook
Street Bureau of Mayfair Ltd (which
recently floated as a public company in
Britain) has been in Sydney for four years
and supplies male and female office staff.
The other agency is Manpower (Aus-
tralia) Pty Ltd which claims to be the
largest employment agency in the world.
It started in Melbourne in 1962 and now
has offices in Sydney and Brisbane, with
plans to extend to Adelaide and Perth.
Brook Street lays claim to being the
largest supplier of office staff in the
world, while Manpower, which provides
not only office staff but trained personnel
for market research, sales, technical work
and so on, says it is the world’s biggest
“comprehensive staff service”. At the
time of Brook Street’s going public, the
business was estimated to be worth £stgl
million. Sales volume of Manpower (also
a public company) throughout the world
last year was 73.76 million US dollars.
Manpower’s 347 offices around the
world last year sold 37 million man-
hours of service. It took 190,000 men
and women to supply this time to the
125,000 customers needing help. Man-
power in Australia operates under licence
from the US Manpower Inc., but all its
capital is held in Australia. Brook Street,
on the other hand, is wholly owned by
its British parent.
Mrs Pauline Nagle, manageress of
Brook Street Bureau in Australia, said
the agency hoped to expand from its
present Sydney-only operation to Mel-
bourne at the end of this year and was
considering opening suburban branches.
Mrs Nagle said she felt there was a
good market for employment agencies in
Australia. “Firms here are now getting
to the stage where they don’t want to
waste time interviewing applicants for
jobs,” she said.
“The agencies are filling a particularly
useful function for the small business-
man or office where to interview appli-
cants for a job might mean a day wasted,
especially in one-man businesses like
law firms or accountants’ offices.”

LETTER
The Education of
Accountants
SIR. —ln replying to Mr J. O. Miller’s
Janus-like defence of orthodoxy, for he
echoes (8., July 17, p. 67) precisely the
central errors which have been debated,
I have the feeling of doing battle with
a mirror image of Brian Quinn. What I
have had to say about the Martin and
Vatter reports is essentially related :o
what was initially placed before readers
—Brian Quinn’s version of those reports.
That the reports had been misread is
firm ground and common ground.
On the question of the numbers of
students involved, the most recently re-
leased figures confirm my broad thesis.
The record attests the reference to only
1000 other (non-university) students of
accountancy. Mr Miller is indeed clutch-
ing at straws when he takes up and
endorses, but at the same time distorts,
my generous suggestion of an unwitting
error, for even 10,000 is only a partial
correction.' It is useful, on this one point,
to bring the information up to date.
There are, at the present time, in 1965,
an estimated 31,500 other (non-univer-
sity) students studying accountancy
throughout Australia 20,000 at tech-
nical colleges and 11,500 studying by
other means.
The 1965 university enrolments in the
accountancy specialisation amount to
about 2750 (an estimate, being part of
the total enrolments in Commerce and
Economics degrees of 8312). The really
startling feature of the technical college
enrolments is the high proportion of
matriculants, as high as 30 p.c. in one
recent sample. These are the relevant
magnitudes.
In general, Mr Miller is mistaken as
to the nature of the debate. It is Mr
Quinn’s article, containing Mr Quinn's
views on the Martin and Vatter reports,
the view he placed before readers, which
is the relevant material and the principal
subject matter for my reply.
I might add that a point-by-point
refutation of Mr Miller’s criticisms, and
an explanation of every nuance in my
reply to Mr Quinn, is quite unnecessary.
That we do need . . constructive
thought and comment (from the) mem-
bers of the profession” and that there
. . are many genuine problems to be
overcome . . .” is, however, agreed and
clear. But not on the entirely pre-
sumptuous footing that the Vatter and
Martin reports are to be implemented,
as Mr Quinn, and now Mr Miller,
clearly imply.

INVESTMENT
A Very Notable Expansion
BHP’s plant, profit and par issue
T>HP deservedly packed the headlines
last week. Investors could well have
been expecting a full week to digest the
notable and technically up-to-date ex-
pansion plans for Port Kembla. They
were given no rest. Hard upon the latest
of a long line of capital projects came
the outstanding £19,625,313 profit for
the year to May 3 I and, gilding the lily
with a vengeance, a one-for-seven par
issue.
Each of these events must have con-
siderable influence both upon the Aus-
tralian economy generally and within
the more limited sphere of the share-
markets. The preliminary spasms at least
prevented the overall stock exchanges
from retreat and afterwards led a
measurable recovery, though on de-
cidedly small ranges.
Perhaps it is true, as one prominent
Queensland broker believes, that “the
market is probably now in the process
of swinging gradually from a bear to
a bull market”. Yet not even BHP can
quite clarify the effects of drought, Viet-
nam and a now more optimistically re-
garded Federal Budget.
And the steel giant still leaves a few
problems of its own, despite the last few
months’ talk around the projected share
issue. The issue will certainly rejuvenate
the company’s investment stance. Where
does it stand, however, in the light of
that remarkable cash flow?
The larger facilities to be added to the
Port Kembla steelworks comprise a new
plate and hot strip mill and a new blast
furnace. Directors estimate that these
alone “will cost in excess of £4O mil-
lion”. They also mention that “many
other units will be embraced in the pro-
gramme including new coke ovens, new
steel-making and rolling equipment and
additions to the tinplate plant”.
A further amount approaching £4O
million could thus be demanded for the
whole Port Kembla scheme, some of
which will go into actual operation “in
the latter part of 1967”.
This latest BHP development places
considerable emphasis on-extension of
flat products, eventually giving a com-
bined hot strip and plate capacity of
4.5 million tons a year against 1964-65’s
output of 1.8 million tons. The blast
furnace, to be commissioned in 1968, is
designed for an annual output of one
million tons of pig iron.
Directors themselves point out that
the “expansion of flat products will have
an effect through many fields of Aus-
tralian secondary industry”. It is easy
to think of building, motor vehicles and
consumer durables. Flats have, up to
now, constituted a rather undue pro-
portion of the country’s steel imports.
The new plant could conceivably pro-
duce above normal domestic require-
ments, thereby putting BHP into a more
favorable export position. That is cer-
tainly desirable from the national, and
the company, viewpoint. BHP’s enforced
“in-and-out” cultivation of export mark-
ets has frequently been a hindrance in
past years.
Low Earning Rate
Commonwealth Mining Invest-
ments still has a somewhat
mediocre earning rate, despite the fact
that profits have more than doubled in
the last three years. For the latest term
to June 30 they jumped 50 p.c., from
£290,000 to £435,000. Two years ago
profit was only £lBO,OOO. Earning rate
is now 13.6 p.c. compared with 9.1 p.c.
last year. Dividend has been held at
6.7 p.c., or Bd. on each 10s. share.
The result would not have been pos-
sible without the wide tax concessions
which the group enjoys. Although the
provision was more than doubled, it still
stands at a mere £58,000. Although
this may take the edge off the big
profit figure, shareholders can rest easy,
as the result does not include substantial
profits on the sale of investments during
the year. These totalled £415,000
(almost as much as the profit), up from
£147,000 in 1963-64.
Income is earned mainly from the
various shareholdings in both Aus-
tralian and overseas mining companies.
At balance date last year the portfolio
had a balance-sheet value of £3.7 mil-
lion and a market value of £5.8 million,
so there is still plenty of scope for
taking capital profits. Consolidated
Goldfields of South Africa has a 5 p.c.
equity in CMI.
Elan Declared
I>ritish Tobacco’s plans to move into
the frozen food field are now un-
deniably plain. The group has taken over
Diamond Foods of WA and has a con-
trolling interest in Frozo Food, a pri-
vately-owned Melbourne concern. At the
time of going to press, Sou’West Frozen
Food Packers, also of Melbourne, are
still negotiating with a large listed com-
pany with an eye to being taken over.
Although the directors’ lips are sealed on
the identity of the other party, it is still
an odds-on bet that it is British Tobacco.
What will the group’s next move be?
As all the offerees to date have been un-
listed companies, another move in this
direction seems to be logical. However,
it is certain that one or more of the pub-
lic companies are being looked over.
No doubt the unlisted groups are the
most attractive, since they offer the best
chance of rapid expansion. The listed
companies have already expanded wide-
ly with moneys from their floats and
subsequent issues.
British Tobacco looks like being a
really stiff competitor in the industry.
It has plans, apparently, for the estab-
lishment of a nationwide marketing net-
work. Once this is established, there will
probably be a rapid diversification into
the freezing of all types of vegetables.
On US experience, this is the key to


PRESTIGE LIMITED
Annual Meeting, 26th July, 1965
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS
The following are extracts from the address to the 1965 Annual Meeting
by the Chairman of Prestige Limited, Mr. George G. Foletta:
CAPITAL-INTENSIVE INDUSTRIES
Capital-intensive industries, at the
present time, are subject to more pressure
from the export drives of developed
economies than any other division of in-
dustry, and the reason is that, whether
located in Australia or overseas, for profit-
able operation, capital-intensive industry
relies principally on keeping costly equip-
ment operating continuously and close to
optimum capacity. Overheads are so high
that when local demand falls sufficiently
to warrant it, such industries take ad-
vantage of every concession their Govern-
ments make towards increasing income
from exports, and sell abroad at the best
price obtainable, provided such price, to-
gether with the subsidies (direct or in-
direct), is sufficient to make some contri-
bution to overheads.
In this regard, it must be acknowledged
that the Australian Government condones
this practice by indirectly subsidising ex-
ports and offering advice through the De-
partment of Trade on similar ways and
means of increasing the export of manu-
factures by differential costing systems.
For this reason alone, it could prove
difficult, at international level, to deal
with this practice under anti-dumping
legislation.
However, the benefits we expect to ob-
tain from progressive increases in pro-
ductivity will accrue only if local demand
on capital-intensive industry is main-
tained at adequate levels
DECENTRALISATION
We have built up far too many areas
such as Latrobe Valley, Wollongong, New-
castle, and Bell Bay, to quote just a few, in
which Australia is not only wasting a very
considerable resource in the form of un-
employed female labour, but is also in-
creasing her production costs in heavy
industry, because, without employment
available to light labour, female in par-
ticular, whole families are forced to
migrate to city ax - eas. Consequently, to
hold skilled staff, the cost of male labour
is continually being pressed up to sub-
sidise other members of the family. Train-
ing new labour is a costly business. The
alternative is that at an early age families
are broken by the migration of young
women to the cities.
INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY
VIA BALANCED INDUSTRY
To cover adequately the cost of servicing
the capital spent on labour-saving equip-
ment, and also reduce production costs
and selling prices, the demand from con-
sumer goods and finished product in-
dustries (i.e., “end-user” industries) must
be sufficient to sustain production at
economic levels in the semi-raw material
industries (i.e., “aids to production” in-
dustries), and so on, until the demand
throughout the chain is sufficient to main-
tain economic levels of production in the
basic industries. When excessive imports
break this sequence in any industry in the
chain, costs rise and productivity falls not
only in that industry, but in all divisions
of industry back to those whose raw
materials are indigenous.
INDUSTRIAL PROTECTION
Maintaining this cost saving sequence in
production levels will test the skill of the
Tariff Board. Controls such as quantita-
tive restrictions and the rationing of over-
seas expenditure are insufficiently selec-
tive and far more inflationary than tariffs.
Unfortunately, under the procedure the
Tariff Board is obliged to adopt in order
to comply with Australia’s commitments
under trade agreements, tariff revision is
an unduly time consuming procedure.
However, time could be considerably re-
duced by a more realistic and less
academic approach to tariff making.
It is encouraging to note that the need
to conserve overseas funds by import re-
placement has been given sufficient con-
sideration at Cabinet level to result in
more explicit terms of reference in relation
to industrial protection.
future prospects
So far in the current financial year,
although intensely competitive conditions
have persisted in several of the Group’s
divisions, sales to date have been a little
higher than in the preceding year. At
this early stage of the year it is always
extremely difficult to forecast what the
results of the full year are likely to be.
In this year in particular much w'll depend
on the extent to which confidence in the
Australian economy is maintained. It is
thought, however, that results for the year
will not markedly differ from those of
last year.
A vital factor in the success of the
Group in past years has been its readiness
to seize opportunities for expansion and
for diversification within its specialised
fields. Such opportunities still exist, and
they are being closely watched by your
Board. Indeed, as indicated in the Direc-
tors’ Report, decisions have already been
made to enter into new activities. Although
your company continues to plough back
substantial sums annually, these and other
new ventures will naturally require ad-
ditional finance, and the methods by
which this finance will be obtained, whilst
preserving the soundness of the Group’s
financial structure, are now being
examined.
The conclusions reached as a result of
this examination will be communicated to
shareholders in due course.
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
It is fitting that, as Chairman, I should
welcome to the position of Managing
Director Mr. A. G. Eastwood. Mr. East-
wood’s appointment assures to the Prestige
Group as a whole the benefit of the sterl-
ing qualities of leadership which, over
many years, made such a valuable contri-
bution to the success of Holeproof In-
dustries Ltd.
It is also fitting that, in so doing, I
should express the grateful thanks of the
Board, and I am sure also of shareholders,
to Mr. H. C. Poletta who has now retired
from the position of Managing Director
(which he held for three years) in order
to assume the new position of Deputy
Chairman. Mr. Foletta’s service to the
company has extended over forty years,
and has been of inestimable benefit to the
Group.
Although I have talked a great deal
about the value of efficient plant and
equipment, as indicated by the Board
when reporting on Holeproof Industries
Ltd., both the goodwill we enjoy and the
success of the business of the whole of
the Prestige Group depend on people.
Mostly in Australia, but also in New
Zealand, your companies now employ well
in excess of 4,000 people, and it is to these
men and women that I would like to
express your Board’s apnreciation of their
enthusiasm, loyalty, and service, without
which the year’s results would not have
been possible.
I remember the earliest days of this
company, when I would have been pleased
to know that the year’s sales would reach
£l4 thousand, and shareholders will
aopreciate my pleasure in the fact that
this year’s sales exceeded £l4 million.
Throughout our history, it has been the
pride taken in the company’s achieve-
ments, not only by too management but
also by countless enthusiastic people,
which has enabled Prestige Ltd. to make
such a splendid contribution to industrial
development generally.
Your Board’s confidence in the future
results from forward planning, whe’ebv
the responsibility for too management in
all subsidiaries and divisions has pro-
gressivelv been assumed by an efficient
and enthusiastic band of-younger men.

Not in a Muddle
TW’utt and Muddle Holdings Ltd,
poker machine manufacturer, was
trading satisfactorily, chairman Mr J. H.
Peoples told shareholders at a statutory
meeting last week. He said the company’s
affairs were proceeding “most satisfac-
torily” and he had “every hope for pros-
perity for the future”.
Although the company had not yet
formulated a dividend policy it wouid
probably pay interim dividends as pro-
posed in the prospectus issued in May,
Mr. Peoples added. The company’s re-
cently listed 2s. shares are presently sel-
ling for 6s. 3d.
Warming to He cl a
T)redictably, Hecla Australia has
raised its dividend after a record
year to April 30. The payout is up from
9 to 10 p.c. in one final amount. Last
year it was raised from the 8 p.c. paid
since listing in 1961. The latest distribu-
tion is covered more than three times
by the profit, so further dividend lifts
or possibly capital benefits seem very
likely in the current year.
Profit came out at a record £141,000,
up by nearly 20 p.c. on last year. Earn-
ing rate has thus risen from 21.4 to
25.5 p.c. The record result followed a
“satisfactory” increase in sales, so pos-
sibly it was partly attributable to cost
savings during the year. The annual
report and balance sheet will tell the
full story.
As the company operates in the
highly competitive (and often cut-throat)
manufacture and distribution of elec-
trical goods, the result is no less than
excellent. It reflects the quality of the
group's products rather than its ability
to dish out the dirt with the rest of
them. This is all to the good in the
long run and is evidenced by the fact
that sales have continued to rise at a
satisfactory rate in the first few months
of the current year.
Buoyant Brooklands
HHhe huge increase in profit scored by
Brooklands certainly took investors
by surprise. An increase of fair size was
expected following the announcement of
a higher dividend at the end of June
the year's payout was raised from 14

to 15 p.c. But nobody expected the
profit to rise by 55 p.c,, from £135,000
to a record £209,000. As sales were
also the highest ever, the result augurs
well for the announcements yet to come
.from other automotive parts suppliers.
Earning rate has also taken an astro-
nomical rise from 26.8 to 41.8 p.c.
Actually, the increase is a much needed
one. In November next, paid capital will
be boosted 40 p.c. by the conversion
of £198,000 worth of seven p.c. notes
into ss. shares.
Shareholders may have received extra
benefits had it not been for this con-
version. In addition, directors said last
week that funds had to be conserved
because of the tight conditions for
money at present and the high level
of interest rates. They were confident
that the group would gain another satis-
factory share of the market in the cur-
rent year, but pointed out that a tempor-
ary slow-down was expected in the
motor industry’s growth rate. On this
advice, 1965-66 could be a difficult
year for any companies in the industry
which have not boosted profits substan-
tially in 1964-65.

Car Troubles
Jt seems that the declining profits ex-
perienced recently by companies in
the vehicle distribution business have not
been arrested. Sydney Holden and Vaux-
hall distributor John A. Gilbert Holdings
Ltd-, in its annual accounts, said many
problems lay ahead in the current finan-
cial year.
For its own part, John A. Gilbert ex-
perienced a heavy profit drop in the
year to March 31. Earnings fell from
the 1963-64 record of £215,869 to
£129,534, pushing the earning rate down
from 41.4 p.c. to 23.4 p.c. Directors
mention in the notes accompanying the
accounts that profit margins in the
vehicle distribution industry are much
finer than generally realised.
They say the current financial year
has not opened well, apart from the fin-
ance company, bus operations and a con-
tinued increase in turnover of spare parts
and service. Despite the release of the
new Holden in February, new and used
vehicle sales are down in the current
year and have been less profitable. Dir-
ectors also expect adverse effects from
the drought.
The Sydney motor business in 1964-
65 is aptly described by the phrase
“profitless prosperity”, Gilbert’s direct-
ors add. Other factors which affected
the company’s profit were the increase
in company tax (its latest provision is
£113,504 compared with previous year’s
£150,705), the 2i p.c. increase in sales
tax on passenger vehicles, and the in-
crease in overhead expenses resulting
from the move to the new head office
building.
The one ray. of hope in the directors*

report is that the addition of the Vaux-
hall range of vehicles will offer the com-
pany greater opportunities in the lower-
priced car field. John A. Gilbert’s ss.
shares are currently selling for around
the Bs. 6d. mark and return 8.8 p.c.
from the 15 p.c. dividend.
Not Much Froth
I>allarat Brewing continued its run
of rising profits in the year to May
31, by lifting the net result from
£lll,OOO to £112,000. Earning rate, up
from 12.9 to 13.1 p.c., has gone higher
for the ninth time in succession.
Unfortunately for shareholders, the
earning rate was not quite high enough
to permit another dividend lift. The pay-
out is to be held steady at 12 p.c. Over
the previous three years it has been
lifted by one p.c. at a time from the
9 p.c. paid in 1960-61. Perhaps earn-
ings in the current year will allow a
lift to 13 p.c.
The profit is the best since 1952-53,
when the group was still operating as
an independent brewer. Today the
group runs a chain of 80-odd hotels
and motels throughout Victoria, mainly
in the country districts, and is a hold-
ing company in that great monopoly,
CUB. It also has a sizeable investment
portfolio. Like the rest of CUB’s hold-
ing companies, it distributes almost all
its profits in the form of dividends every
year.
Health Food Issue
Tn its first approach to shareholders
A since joining the public lists three
years ago, health food specialist Associat-
ed Foods Ltd is making a one-for-four
issue of ss. shares at par. The issue will
lift paid capital by £25,000 to £125,000.
Announcing the issue directors say
profit and sales for the year to June 30
have shown a satisfactory increase. How-
ever, the figures have not yet been re-
leased. In 1963-64 the company earn-
ed £15,196, which is equal to 15.2 p.c.
on capital. The shares are currently sel-
ling for about 9s. 6d. where they yield
5.4 p.c. from the 10 p.c. dividend.
Growing Seeds
lAespite the severe drought in NSW,
_ Andersons Seeds Ltd, according to
directors, is doing considerably better
this year. They say that in the six months
to March the company maintained sales
in the face of adverse seasonal condi-
tions Results achieved indicate there
will be a “substantial lift” in the group’s
turnover for the current year.
Directors say profit for the first six
months of the year was in line with
budget forecasts and higher than for the
previous year’s corresponding period.
They add that they still expect to be
able to pay an 8 p.c. annual dividend
on capital increased during the current
year by a one-for-three share issue at
par and a placement with local and over-
seas institutions.
Victoria Comeback
HThe Victoria Holdings took a sub-
stantial turn for the better in the
year to June 30. Thanks to rising occu-
pancy rates and a rigid hand on costs,
profit jumped 30 p.c., from £64,000 to
£83,000. The company operates the
Victoria unlicensed hotel in Little Col-
lins Street, Melbourne (the largest of
its kind in Australia), and also dabbles
as a caterer and restaurateur. With earn-
ing rate up from 10.6 to 13.7 p.c.,
shareholders are to be rewarded with a
lift in the annual dividend from 8 to 9
p.c.
Although the profit is the second-best
in the hotel’s long, long history, the
company is still far from what it once
was. Earning rate was 22.2 p.c. in
1959-60. In 1960-61 it toppled to 11.6
p.c. and dividend was a narrowly
covered 11 p.c. In 1961-62 the earning
rate slipped further to 10.5 p.c. and
the dividend was cut to 8 p.c., where
it stayed until the latest year.
Like the dividend, profits have finally
arisen from a period of stagnation. No
gain was scored at all in 1962-63 and
the improvements which took place last
year ended up being offset by higher
tax and increase in State land taxes.
With occupancy rates on the improve,
it seems that the Victoria may be on
the way to making a comeback to its
former self.
Spreading Interests
TTire - purchase financier Associated
Securities Ltd continues to increase
profits. In the year to June 30 it lifted
earnings 22 p.c. to maintain earning rate
on substantially higher capital. Profit
rose from £580,718 to £705,361, follow-
ing gains of £79,141 in 1964 and
£27,731 in 1963.
The latest result is equal to 29.3 p.c.
on capital increased during the period
by a one-for-ten bonus issue and a one-
for-three cash issue. Earning rate in
1963-64 was 26.1 p.c. Profit remained
after tax of £456,237 (previously
£325,011) and undisclosed depreciation
(£72,928). A final 8 p.c. payment
brings the year’s dividend to 16 p.c. for
the fifth successive year.
In their preliminary report directors
say the company, while retaining its
interest in motor vehicle finance, has
extended activities into other avenues
of lending. An indication of this diversi-
fication is the rise of funds in equipment
on lease. This amount rose from £739,669
to £2,697,568 (less depreciation). Con-
tracts on which interest is charged
monthly were up from £3,338,670 to
£5,729,515.
Real estate receivables increased
slightly from £6,620,403 to £7,304,313.
For the first time in more than 15 years
hire-purchase receivables fell from
£25,007,095 to £23,822,609. Unearned
income on these receivables fell from
£3,424,616 to £3,251,193.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Chasing an Earning Rate Rise
General Credits' path to recovery
Touring 1962 the shares of General
” Credits Holdings Ltd fell as low as
ss. and this was the year that the share-
holders did not receive any dividend.
Strangely enough, the shares fell to the
same low point in 1965, when the signs
of a recovery were very clear and when
it seemed fairly certain that the dividend
rate would be increased by 20 p.c. over
its level for the two preceding years.
It seems rather strange that the main
subsidiary, General Credits Limited, was
only formed in April, 1953. It was then
a wholly owned subsidiary of the Auto-
mobile Fire and General Insurance
Company of Australia Limited, a com-
pany formed in 1922 by the Royal Auto-
mobile Club of Victoria to undertake
the motor insurance of its members.
According to the Sydney Stock
Exchange’s statistical service (which is
generally a precis of published informa-
tion), General Credits was formed “to
take advantage of the large amount of
hire-purchase business offering and at
the same time to help produce further
insurance revenue for the parent com-
pany”. Seven years later, the subsidiary
had virtually swallowed up its parent.
It would seem that today the finance
business is much more important than
the insurance business. (It should per-
haps be pointed out that the association
between the RACV and the Automobile
Fire and General ended in 1928.)
From the 1965 report it seems that
the insurance subsidiary contributed
about 16 p.c. of the group net profit
after tax in 1964/5, although the pro-
portion was nearly 25 p.c. in 1963/4.
Prior to these two years, the insurance
company seems to have been in some
difficulties and its contribution to group
profit was probably not significant in
any of the three prior years. Taking
the last two years only, it seems likely
that the net profit before tax and interest
for the finance group was as shown
below and this profit was produced by
the assets listed:
Year to April 30 1964 1965
Net profit before
tax and interest 2,050 2,463
Average net outstandings
and other liquid assets
excluding "investments" 28,315 32,143
These figures would show a return
of 7.25 p.c. in 1964 and 7.66 p.c. in
1965, as compared with the figures of
8.37 p.c. and 8.46 p.c. for lAC Hold-
ings. It will be readily apparent from
the profit statement summaries of these
two companies that General Credits is
far more heavily involved in the field
of leasing. The depreciation provision
is shown as £1,205,000 whereas lAC’s
depreciation provision was only
£112,000 less than 10 p.c. of General
Credits, although lAC’s net profit before
tax and interest was more than three
times greater than that of General
Credits. This lower return would sug-
gest that either General Credits’
recovery is not yet complete or that
leasing is not as profitable as the more
conventional type of consumer finance.
Of course, it is not possible to make
such generalisations in the finance
industry to-day, when competition has
cut margins to a very fine level.
General Credits does not seem to have
been under any disability when it came
to raising money. This is no doubt due
to the association with the Commercial
Bank of Australia and the fact that all
issues of fixed interest securities have
been underwritten by one of the best-
known of Melbourne stockbroking firms.
The average rate of interest that has
been paid in the last four years on
average borrowings has been:
Year to April 30 1962 1963 1964 1965
Percentages 6.50 6.54 6.83 6.72
These figures suggest that General
Credits has not been at any competitive
disadvantage with lAC so far as bor-
rowing costs are concerned. In fact,
lAC’s average rates were only fraction-
ally lower in the last two years and
quite considerably higher in 1962.
the recovery which has taken
" place since the first six months of the
1961/2 year (when the directors
reported that “trading had not proved
profitable”) has been quite real, it has
not been as dramatic as some expected
early in 1963. One writer suggested
that the earning rate would reach double
figures in 1962/3; as we can see, this
rate was only just achieved in 1964/5.
The preference dividend charged against
earnings in that year was only £6055
but this charge will increase to £32,500
when the preference issue is fully taken
up and a full year’s dividend payable.
This means that, just to maintain the
“double figures” position, earnings will
need to rise by £BOOO, approximately,
over the 1964/5 level of £359,849.
The latest prospectus (for £1 million
“second series” debentures) indicates
that the overall borrowing limitation is
that aggregate liabilities (excluding the
provision for unexpired insurance risks)
shall not exceed 80 p.c. of total tangible
assets (which includes the income to
mature provision). It would seem that,
if we exclude the preference issue from
the shareholders’ funds and make a
deduction of the same amount from the
assets, the maximum amount that could
have been borrowed prior to the issue
of the preference shares would have
been about £31.4 million. This amount
includes all other liabilities except the
provision for unexpired insurance risks.
The issue of preference shares does not
seem to increase the total amount that
can be borrowed by more than 80 p.c.
of the amount of the preference issue.
However, it will increase quite consider-
ably the amount which can be borrowed
under the debenture deed, where up to
seven times shareholders’ funds may be
borrowed. This means that, provided
shareholders’ funds is the limiting factor,
the debentures on issue can be increased
by £3.5 million when the preference
shares are fully paid.
As at April 30, 1965, total liabilities
were £30.8 million, according to the
published balance sheet. Ignoring the
probable differences between the pub-
lished consolidated balance sheet and the
balance sheet on which the. borrowing
limitations would be based, the further
amount that could be borrowed as at
April 30, 1965, was £2.6 million.
Assuming the same rate of net profit
before tax and interest (7.66) and the
same average rate of interest on borrow-
ings (6.72), this further borrowing would
only add about £14,000 to the net profit
after tax.
It seems, therefore, that the earning
rate is unlikely to rise much above 10
p.c. in the near future unless some
dramatic change in profitability occurs.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Rather Dim Current Outlook
The long-term promise of FMC
piMC (Australia) Ltd, of Melbourne,
originates from a firm called Hughes,
Pye and Rigby, established in the 1870 s
as a group of mining engineers.
Naturally, the firm has expanded and
changed since then and its name
has been altered five times. The last
alteration was in 1962. Prior to that,
the group was known on the Stock
Exchange lists as Food Machinery (Aus-
tralia) Ltd. The alteration was to give
a closer alliance with the FMC Corpora-
tion of the US, which holds a controlling
interest. This interest was obtained in
1948. At that stage the group had been
making food processing equipment for
22 years, since 1926. It became a public
company in the 1880 s as Austral Otis
Engineering and Elevator Co. Ltd.
Today the company makes machinery
for the food processing, petroleum and
mining industries, also agricultural equip-
ment including orchard sprayers, deep
bore pumps and irrigation systems. It
uses designs from the Californian parent.
Hydraulic brake presses and shears are
made under licence from another Cali-
fornian concern, Pacific Industrial Manu-
facturing Co.
The holding company executes its
business through ten subsidiaries nine
in Victoria and one in NSW. Eight of
the ten embrace the W. J. Powell group
of companies.
A feature of the business in recent
times has been an inability to keep up
with demand. At each half-year or year’s
end, directors have been reporting sub-
stantial backlogs of unfilled orders. These
are, of course, not entirely the result
of excess demand, as much of the busi-
ness involves term contracts which may
be only half-finished at any given time.
Much of this demand has been for can-
ning (mainly fruit) equipment and the
installation of equipment for the milk
and abattoir industries.
So it can be seen that success depends
to a large extent on factors which are
out of the directors’ hands; that 's,
seasonal and other conditions in in-
dustries such as the abovementioned. To
this extent, the group is unpredictable.
But, given adequate demand from these
sectors, success depends on a second
factor the successful and profitable
tendering for contracts. This item is
entirely in the directors’ hands.
A fairly successful record of con-
tracting has been a feature of the busi-
ness. Unfortunately, the record has been
broken in the current year. Directors
have predicted that profits for the 12
months to October 31 could be lower
than last year’s £84,000. Non-recurring
losses on “certain contracts” reduced
profit in the six months to April 30.
Despite the backlog of orders at April
30, the seasonal nature of the business
and the lower profits to date indicate
that the lost ground will not be made up
by the end of October.
This, of course, has dire implications
for the dividend. Last year it was a
steady 10 p.c. and covered by earnings
of only 12.5 p.c. As it is, the normal 5
p.c. interim has been omitted for the
current year. Fortunately, the passing
of the interim is not as serious as would
seem at first glance.
Directors said in their interim report
that a decision had been made to revert
to the old practice of paying only one
dividend annually —at the end of the
year. Moreover, the group is in need of
liquid cash to finance a new building
programme and to catch up with the
backlog of orders.
Thus, although the outlook for the
current year is rather dim, the long term
holds great promise. The building pro-
gramme should bring about higher profits
and lower costs. At present, three
separate plants are operating. The plan
is to put everything under one roof in
a new modern factory at Clayton. In
addition, profits should return to normal

and a bank overdraft. As a result, work-
ing capital ceased its growth trend last
year—just when more cash was needed
for the Clayton establishment. Fixed
assets have grown slowly Overall and
intangibles are much too high. Writing-
down will no doubt come when earning
rates rise above their recent mediocre
levels. Offsetting all this is an extremely
pleasing absence of any loan capital at
all. Reserves and ordinary capital have
hardly moved since 1962.
Depreciation provisions appear erratic.
Profits have grown slowly though there
should be some concern that last year’s
£84,000 was after substantially less than
normal tax. Earning rates, dividends,
dividend yields, and share prices all
reflect a fairly steady trend.
To sum up: The 20s. shares, currently
fetching around 315., seem risky buying
at the moment. There is every chance
that no dividend will be paid this year.
If there is a distribution, it will probably
be less than 10 p.c. For the long term,
the group appears an attractive proposi-
yet the current prices could very
well fall lower over the next few months
and offer entry at less than 31s. The long
term looks good because of the group’s
US backing, its plans for a new factory
and its generous capital issue history
when earning rates permit. As the table
shows, there was an issue in 1961-62, a
one-for-one at a 17s. 6d. premium. Other
issues have been one-for-one at a 4s.
premium in 1949-50, one-for-one at a
10s. premium in 1952-53 and three-for-
four at a ss. premium in 1956-57.
Generosity has been the keynote when
profits permitted.

BIS LEY CLOTH IN G LTD
Shirts on Success
T>isley Clothing Ltd sold more than
half a million shirts last year, yet
a glance at the latest accounts shows that
it has very little invested in plant and
machinery and nothing in factories.
It is just this fact which has enabled
Bisley to show such a healthy result for
the past few years. The company acts
as a distributor, contracting out most
of the work of shirt-making. This means
that most of its funds have been available
for financing stocks and debtors.
Bisley was formed to acquire the issued
capital of Hubbard and Co. Pty Ltd,
which began operations in 1950. It floated
as a public company in late 1959 with a
placement of 240,000 ss. shares at par
and came on the Stock Exchange lists
with a paid-up capital of £140,000.
Since then capital has been increased
to £230,000. Early in 1961, shareholders
were offered one new ss. share at par for
every five held. The other increases came
about by the exercise of options held by
the original vendors. The MLC Assur-
ance holds the £30,000 in 8] p.c. pre-
ference shares which are redeemable next
year.
The company now operates through 12
subsidiaries, 11 in New South Wales and
one in South Australia. The most recently
acquired were Town Talk Ties Pty Ltd
and David Klippel Pty Ltd, both of which
have made and distributed ties and neck-
wear for many years. Bisley holds a
majority interest in these companies.
Both were acquired for cash.
For the first three years after listing,
Bisley earned profits which covered the
15 p.c. dividend requirements by a con-
siberable amount. In 1962, directors de-
cided to change the balance date from
June 30 to December 31, for they said
the change presents a better picture of
stock on hand.
Profit for the six months changeover
period was equal to more than 23 p.c. on
an annual rate, while dividend was held
at a 15 p.c. annual rate. The following
year, 1963, dividend was cut to 10 p.c.
although covered more than twice by
profits.
Last year saw a substantial increase in
profit, with sales 60 p.c. higher than two
years earlier. As a result, group earnings
came out at £100,370, equal to 48.9 p.c.
on capital. Dividend was increased to 12]
p.c. by the inclusion of a bonus 2+ p.c.
Directors attributed the improvement to
a general and still rising demand for syn-

thetics and the development of the com-
' pany’s own fabrics.
The profit was achieved after only a
slight increase in tax provision, from
£14,147 to £14,450, due most probably
to the benefit of tax losses and some ex-
port incentive rebates.
The accounts clearly show the rapid
growth in sales. At last balance date,
trade debtors were up from £271,539 to
£304,418, while stock was £19,980 higher
at £167,613. At the same time, trade
creditors were down from £101,452 to
£85,420.
The company is in a highly liquid
position. There appears to be little reason
why it should need to call on shareholders
for funds in the near future. The re-
serves position is strong, although with
intangibles in the accounts at £68,636
(principally goodwill on consolidation)
the ss. ordinary share has a net assets
backing of 6s. Id.
The company’s shares are currently
selling below 10s., although earlier this
year they were at 12s. The future is not
going to be easy, for success can only
breed greater competition. In addition,
tax liability is likely to have to increase
soon, although with such a wide cover
last year, the 12i p.c. (or even a 15 p.c.
distribution) would not appear to be in
any danger.
Directors have demonstrated they are
not becoming complacent and have pre-
pared plans to expand activities to the
US and the UK. Plans have also been
made for expanding activities in New
Zealand, for some time a good market
for the company’s products, while recent-
ly an agent was appointed in Malaysia.
The current year has begun well, with
sales higher than in the corresponding
period of the previous year. The group's
spring and summer range has met an
excellent reception and winter ranges are
also doing well.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
On a Variety of Issues
Pleasantly uncomplicated buying
■WTith so many new issues around, it’s
an interesting exercise contrasting
the methods used by the different com-
panies to get their shares listed.
At one extreme is George Weston.
Here there was no reconstruction or even
change of capital. The Potter “Family”
happened to own a million shares (or 2V
p.c. of the share capital) and they sold
them off to clients.
Nuttall was the first float in Australia
done on a tender basis. After the com-
pany was reconstructed, an offer of part
of the new capital was made to the public
by tender. As I remember it, the final
price at which the issue was made was
10s. 3d. just 2s. above the base issue
price of Bs. 3d. Very satisfying for the
underwriters, who not only got their
underwriting fee but also shared in hajf
this profit.
A more conventional issue was Wreck-
air Holdings Ltd. The original company
went through a capital reconstruction
and then an offer of 480,000 shares (30
p.c. of the issued capital) was made by
the shareholders to the public at a firm
price of 6s. 2Vd.
To the intending investor, this must
have seemed a very reasonable proposi-
tion. Not only did it offer a good divi-
dend yield of 8 p.c. on the 10 p.c. divi-
dend rate, but also gave evidence that
there was a reasonable element of
growth in the stock. On the figures
given in the prospectus, both sales and
profits had risen consistently, with the
result that earning rate for the year just
finished should work out at about 24 p.c.
Like my friend Eglo, the market debut
of Wreckair was made in a rather dull
atmosphere. Once the stags were out of
the way, however, the price moved
steadily up from 7s. My order for 400
caught the price at 7s. 9d.
Wreckair is pleasantly uncomplicated
from an analyst’s point of view. Not so
Thiess Holdings. After several years of
reasonable profits and steady 12V p.c.
dividends, a huge loss of £900,000 was
incurred in the 1963-64 year. On top of
this was an appropriation of £BOO,OOO for
estimated future losses on contracts.
Understandably this toppled the share
price below par. The interim report
seems to indicate that the worst is over.
As for the future, the danger of cut-
throat tendering should be only too
apparent to the directors. With the shares
at 45., my order went in for 500.
The final purchase of the week was
50 CSR. My eye has been on this com-
pany ever since the announcement of
the 12 p.c. fall in profit last financial
year. At the time there was a slight
reaction in the price, though it immedi-
ately recovered. When the annual report
was published a little while later, it was
disclosed that directors expected profits
to fall in the current year. Yet once
again the share price hardly faltered and,
in fact, a few days later it started to
move up strongly.
As the shares seem desperate to rise,
1 figured the last chance to buy them
would be after the annual meeting last
Wednesday. 1 did just that, so joining
the ranks of 33,000 shareholders, a huge
number of people in anyone’s language.
As one shareholder at the meeting
pointed out, so large that, if the annual
meetings ever became popular, they
would have to be held in Hyde Park!
As usual I’ve paid too much attention
to buying and not enough to selling. I
settled on getting rid of 1000 Macquane
Worsted and 500 Nuttall both good
little companies yet neither had moved
much during their stay in the portfolio.
The total profit on the two sales was £9.
Transactions for the week were:

THE MAN ON THE LAND
The Canberra Wool Debate
Gunn misses the big hit
Tn playing Mr G. Le Couteur as
number one in the reserve price
debate in Canberra, the Free Marketers
were at least able to hold the Wool
Board team to a draw. Messrs Ashton
and Lawson, backing up Le Couteur,
were adequate in defence, as were
Messrs Nevile and Campbell on the
Wool Board side.
The interest, naturally, was in the
clash between Le Couteur and Sir Wil-
liam Gunn, each taking the attacking
role. Gunn, as usual, went for the big
hit but somehow his timing was off.
At one stage he resorted to an appeal
to the umpire, yet did not get much
help from that quarter either. It's not
like him to call foul he must have
been worried.
In that part of the debate which was
televised Le Couteur definitely put up a
better showing than Gunn. But, and
this is the point which will not be lost
upon woolgrowers, Mr Le Couteur is
a broker (general manager of Australian
Mercantile Land and Finance Co. Ltd).
The average woolgrower will therefore
be inclined to wonder why the Com-
mittee for the Retention and Improve-
ment of the Free Wool Market had to
resort to a broker as chief spokesman.
Originally Mr Macarthur-Onslow was
to have led the Free Marketers, but he
became ill. Then Mr Lawson was to
have taken over; he, for some reason,
stepped aside for Mr Le Couteur. As
brokers and broking are very much
involved in the reserve price issue, the
entire Free Market argument therefore
must inevitably have been weakened, in
spite of the expertness of Mr Le
Couteur’s delivery.
Both sides, ,in this writer's view, got
involved too much in hypothetical
aspects of the reserve price proposal.
These are not the aspects which will
win or lose the reserve price case at
the referendum of growers (though they
may very well decide its success or
failure in practice). For most growers the
issue is simple either they put a
price on their product (like everyone
else from doctors to steelmakers) or
they leave it to the buyers to set what
they think is the right price.
Woolgrowers, unfortunately, are not
very interested at all in what it might
cost the general taxpayer. Nor,, unfor-
tunately, would it appear that the Free
Marketers are any more interested in
this particular aspect of the issue. To
date, anyway, they haven't used it very
effectively as a tactic.
Indeed, Mr Le Couteur’s counter-pro-
posal, that the present plan be scrapped
and an emergency plan be brought in,
contains the promise of altogether mas-
sive Government (i.e. taxpayer) buying-in
of wool if the authorities (presumably
the Government and the woolgrowers)
decide that any particular year is an
emergency. There is no suggestion that
anyone else have a say as to whether
it is really an emergency year or not.
Given this kind of plan, the Gov-
ernment and the woolgrowers could
well decide that 1966 is an emergency
year. There is a bad drought, the wool
cheque is down £7B million, shearers
and other pastoral employees have just
been given substantial award increases,
and taxation and defence spending are
bound to. rise. China might not buy
wheat, either, as a reprisal against our
sending of troops to Vietnam. The pic-
ture is gloomy enough for it to be an
emergency year, is it not?
Asa factor in the reserve price issue
itself the great debate, therefore, was
something of a washout. What Mr Le
Couteur did prove, though, is that Gunn
is vulnerable.
If Gunn is going to make the hit in
politics that he obviously hopes to, then
he will have to learn the art of picking
his mark. In his own environment, wool-
growers and men on the land generally,
he is great. He can indulge in repartee
and he can bully his opponents as much
as he likes. Outside this sort of audience
he can be very good too, provided he
sticks to a set speech (e.g., the address
to bankers in New York).
An opponent who refuses to be
bluffed, and who refuses to accept a
speech on another subject as an answer
to a specific question, is a different mat-
ter. Gunn appeared to be really in
trouble on the subject of the Inter-
national Wool Textile Organisation atti-
tude to the reserve price plan and his
own relationship with the Wool Board
itself. He went for broke and boasted
that certainly he told the IWTO his
.view, and then got the Wool Board
okay later. It might have been better
for him had he not said it. (Questions
like this are probably the reason the
“old heads” in politics avoid public
debates like the plague.) He appeared
lost for words on a couple of occasions,
he fumbled a bit, and generally his
answer was weak. The Canberra audi-
ence did not appear to appreciate the
humor of Gunn’s remarks.
This particular question is important.
Gunn has gone on record (prior to the
Canberra debate) as saying that he sees
no real reason why, should he be
elected to Parliament, he could not
keep up the Wool Board chairmanship
too. Apparently there is nothing in the
Wool Board constitution which says
that he would have to give it up. It.
seems more than likely, though, that the
Australian Wool Industry Conference will
demand that he step down should he
enter Federal politics.
If Gunn is in a position now to act
on his own initiative, and to demand
acquiescence later from his Board, how
much stronger would he be calling the
shots from a seat in Parliament House.
He would be dictator then.
While all this is revealing, it still
does not give the Free Marketers much
of an edge. Amongst woolgrowers there
is a strong segment which believes that
the industry needs a dictator. The more
Gunn behaves like one the more they
love him. The more he is criticised
for dictatorial tendencies by city
interests, the more they say “good on
you, Bill, that's showing them”.
This segment of woolgrowers can’t
be criticised for this. If that's what they
want, then that is their business.
It becomes a matter for criticism,
however, if any woolgrower champion,
or dictator, gets into a position (through
Parliament) of making decisions for the
rest of us in advance and telling us
about it later. We have heard much
about the threat of government inter-
ference in the wool industry. What about
the threat of woolgrower interference in
the government of the country?
It is only necessary to recall the 1951
referendum on reserve price, when
woolgrowers threw it out. Then they
had a champion, a genuine woolgrower
(like Gunn), only in 1951 the champion
was on the side of free marketing. J. P.
Abbott's role in the 1951 campaign
was virtually the deciding factor. It
seems pretty clear that the supporters
of the free marketing system desperately
need another J. P. Abbott now.
What a strange, coincidence it is that
J. P. Abbott should have passed away
only a few weeks ago, in 1965 the
very year in which the reserve price
issue is to go to another referendum
of growers.


More Farm Politics in NZ
Call for a national policy
From KEN COATES in Auckland
"C'ederated Farmers, the powerful
A New Zealand primary producers’
organisation, is considering entering
politics. Present moves suggest the
group may sponsor “independent” candi-
dates at the general election next year.
Politics in New Zealand has long been
dominated by two parties Labor and
National. Farmer candidates would not
be members of a party.
Proposals aimed at giving farmers a
more direct voice in government Will
be discussed at a National Federated
Farmers’ Conference at the end of this
month. A bid will be made there by
progressive elements to “achieve a com-
mon unity of plans throughout New'
Zealand”. These same elements stress
the organisation will not become a poli-
tical party. If it did, they say, it would
lose its effectiveness.
This move has stemmed from the
attitude of some top farm leaders, who
say they have become disenchanted with
the Government’s attitude towards farm-
ing. They point out farmers are con-
tinually being urged to increase pro-
duction, though there are no realistic
incentives to do so.
Traditionally, the National Party (at
present in power) polls large majorities
in country areas. Prime Minister Keith
Holyoake is a farmer and a former
Minister of Agriculture. But high costs
and taxation have made some farmers
more critical of the Government. Others
are less so. Returns from well-established
and reasonably efficient farms are still
fairly comfortable. Many landowners
are reluctant to spend money, time and
energy in increasing production.
Nevertheless, in an endeavor to
bolster much-needed overseas earnings,
the Government set up a semi-perman-
ent Agricultural Development Confer-
ence, representative of all involved, with
a number of “working parties”. At a
recent meeting of farm leaders from
the rich areas of northern North
Island, the conference was labelled as
a major political bluff.
One regional president, Mr M. G.
Hewitt, said: “We feel there will be
no extra production without some
guarantee of profitability for the extra
effort and capital necessary to achieve
the higher output required.” He urged
Federated Farmers’ leaders throughout
the country to “make every attempt to
establish a united policy at national level
in an effort to influence the Govern-
ment.”
With a drop in London prices for
dairy produce, and a need to push
flagging meat sales in countries other
than Britain, the Government is not
altogether sympathetic to farmers’
demands. A big programme of borrow-
ing and a need fo conserve State spend-
ing does not help, either.
The amount of meat exported to
countries outside Britain has dropped
from 26.78 p.c. to 19.85 p.c. The Gov-
ernment is painfully aware that New
Zealand’s welfare is dependent almost
solely on farm production. It could
do with extra overseas earnings from
increased pioduction. This could only
be achieved by restricting some of the
benefits of the welfare State for a time
and embarking on a bold programme
of greater farm production. The Govern-
ment finds this politically unappetising.
Meanwhile, there is an acute farm
labor shortage. The effect of rising costs
is annoying most farmers, who maintain
they cannot share in higher prices for
goods and services. Farm leaders seem
to be trying all avenues of approach.
Several of the problems, are on the
agenda for the annual National Party
Conference.
Pressure is likely for more immi-
grants, particularly for farm laborers.
Another demand likely is that the
Government take more positive steps to
help exporters of primary produce
absorb increasing costs.
Whether a significant increase in pro-
duction will ever be induced by direct
wooing of farmers remains to be seen.
Development of lucrative markets
other than Britain is probably the long-
term answer. As many farmers say,
“It’s not much use increasing produc-
tion if there’s nowhere to sell it and
Britain will eventually squeeze us out.”
Automation in Fruit Picking
Suction harvester passes tests
Jn the growing of fruit and vegetables
the biggest single cost factor is
harvesting. Despite advances over the
last fifty years the human harvester s
still necessary for many items. If he
(or she) is not still necessary he may
still be desirable because the machines
are clumsy and inefficient.
Now it appears we may be on the
threshold of a mechanical advance which
could revolutionise fruit and vegetable
harvesting. In Australia, where hired
hands are nearly always in short supply,
it could transform our entire farm
economy
_.. , . . ,
The new gadget is a suction harvester,
working on the same principle as a
vacuum cleaner. It has been developed
in Britain and is beine used experi-
, ~ , , ... “ ~
mentally (and with great success) on
,
‘
The machine moves along the rows
sucking in the fruit and is able to
reject such unwanted things as sticks
and clods of earth. It requires little
maintenance and is said to be so simple
• i i
that a child can operate it. It is planned
A F , . . . y. ,
to equip the machine with further
, . 1 K , ... i, • , c
devices which will result in boxes of
f „
fruit being filled automatically.
°
All fruits on trees, and even earth-
bound vegetables such as potatoes, will
eventually be harvested in this way.
That s the dream, and it. could come
true -
In 1965 anyone who disbelieves any-
thing in the mechanical sphere needs to
think again. la 1965 the trains run from
Los Angeles to New York with not
one human hand to raise a signal or

The tremendous advantage of this
suction idea over existing ~ harvesting
machines is that there will be no dam-
age to fruit; less damage, in fact, than

Australia is lucky in this respect and

Those that we do have, should they
