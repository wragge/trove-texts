WHEN THE BLOOD is thin or impure
every organ and libre of the body becomes en-
feebled and loss capable of resisting prevailing
diseases. Among the indications of depraved
blood are boils, carbuncles, pimples, eruptions,
sore eyes, ulcers, tumors, and glandular swell-
ings. To strike at the root of these evils,
cleanse the blood with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla,
This medicine has maintained its world-wide
reputation, for nearly half a century, as the
Standaru Blood-Pianfier.
It is a highly-concentrated extract of the most
powerful vegetable alteratives and tonics. The
most effective remedy for scrofula, it is equally
beneficial in gout, rheumatism, catarrh, and
dyspepsia, also in liver and kidney com-
plaints. A medicine for men, women,

WHO IS
WEAK
MAN
Nervous & Debilitated
Who in his youth has trifled away his vigour of body,
mind, and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINE WAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Organs, who is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINE WAY’S success, which has
become so lirmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts:—ist. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially studied,
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used are
exactly adapted to suit the case, and are compounded
from the purest, freshest, and refined ingredients,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I seek cases where all else has failed.
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
can recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free), Professor STINEWAY, who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
. hood after all other treatment had failed. It
makes no difference what you have taken, or
who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS,
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION :--Are you a sufferer
irom bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Nervous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting ; fullness of blood in the head ; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy ? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains ? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject ? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits ? Arc you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms ? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single con-
sultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed on
the way to health, strength, and vigour jf
All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.
Persons living at a distance who desire
treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and £\, receive
by return of post the medicines required.
Do not despair, even though all others have
failed in your case. No matter what your
complaint may be, call or write—l will cure
you. If you are ill, do not delay !My vast
experience enables me to guarantee a positive
cure in all cases undertaken. CONSUL-
TATIONS FREE. Medicines sent secure
from observation to any part of Australasia.

Registered by the Medical Board of N.S.W.; Late

Specialist for the Treatment of Diseases
OF THE

WHY I ADVERTISE.
I advertise because I consider it necessary that people
suffering from Nervous, Sexual and Chronic Complaints,
should be able to ascertain which
DIIL¥*4IIIALIFIED PRACTITIONERS
make these Diseases a speciality, particularly as, under
the present law, any person can call himself Doctor or
Professor, ichether he is entitled to do so or not; and these
persons exist, chiefly, because Duly Qualified Prac-
titioners have not occupied the field.
Dr. PERRY invites the fullest investigation into his
credentials, and gives his Personal Consideration to
each Case, and in all cases tells the Patient the exact
nature of his complaint, the cost of a cure, and the time
it will take.
Dr. PERRY’S experience in the treatment of these
Diseases has been so varied and extensive, that he is able
to tell absolutely whether the case is curable or not, and
therefore is willing to
Guarantee to CURE EVERY CASE he Undertakes.
VARICOCELE quickly and successfully treated without operation. DIABETES and TUMOURS treated by a
totally new method of Cutaneous Medication.
Send for Dr. PERRY’S Work on Diseases of the Reproductive Organs, Diabetes, Tumours, Skin Diseases,
etc., containing .many simple directions as to SELF-MANAGEMENT, the observance of which is, in many cases,
sufficient to place the Patient in a healthy state. All who are in any way affected should procure this work, and
thus have the benefit of his advice and experience FREE ON APPLICATION.

Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.—Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

SWORN CERTIFICATE.—One of Thousands more, j
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888. !
To H. F. Kugklmank, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that 1, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and. became chronic. I consulted
more than, one doctor, and diiriny that time took a great
quantity -of medicine withou t it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting , away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I |
was expectoratingevery day, 1 became very much alarmed. |
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you,- and 1
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad. one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time 1 commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the' cough disappeared, and the j
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro- !
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN. '

This eminent Specialist. Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS, AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly inveati-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that
afflict mankind.
YOUNG MEN

gressions or excesses of more nature age, bladder
difficulties, a whitish or dark ropy sediment in
the water, accompanied by slight burning or

fear that something dreadful is about to happen,
weak stomach, yellow or blood-shot eyes, impure
blood, hasty, uncontrollable temper, hacking
cough, who cannot marry, nervousness in society,
wakefulness, palpitation of the heart, general
weakness, arid other symptoms which lead to in-
sanity and death, should consult him, for he has
mastered these difficulties. On receipt of 6d. in

manently without unnecessary expence. This
book will prove a valuable companion, and even
though you be perfectly well its general inform-
; ii on an d prescription may assist you in restoring
1 some poor friend to health even after his case has
j been pronounced incurable by his medical at-
tendant.

■ VOUS DEBILITY. Should you require medical
treatment, as procrastination is sometimes dan-
S gexous, it would be advisable for you to sit down

detailing every experienced symptom. He will
on receipt of such a letter, write you, promptly
and courteously, a candid and straightforward
oponion of your case. If you do not think you
understand the case, sciu. for his famous medical

pared questions, which will, in all probability,
assist you materially in describing your ailment.
Dr. Richards uses nothing but the purest remedies,
and never prescribes mercury under any circum-
! gtances.- The moment letters are carefully per-
| used and answered they are destroyed by fire,
I an( i patients may rest assured that their cases
will remain a secret between the doctor and

best rifles and most deadly weapons that I ever pulled trigger of. I think nothing of knocking a kangaroo over at 200

Boycotting.
Boycotting is rapidly becoming the most potent
weapon in the arsenal of Labour, and conse-
quently the immorality of the boycott is the
subject of innumerable tirades in the monopolist
press. Most things in this world, it may be
freely admitted, are more or less immoral, but
boycotting, in the opinion of the capitalist, is
more immoral than all the rest combined. It
is a system which works by the mere force of
the majority, and when brought to perfection
monopoly is absolutely powerless against it.
Like death, it levels everything. A prince, if
placed under this ban in its most effective form,
collapses as promptly as a mud-carter or a
pauper, and the millionaire ship-owner can re-
sist it no more than the solitary shearer, whose
entire assets are his billy and his swag. Ex-
cepting leprosy, it is probably the only known
power which can place the capitalist, while still
alive, on absolutely the same footing as the
labourer, and consequently the howl of indig-
nation which rent the air, as the classes rose
to protest against the sinfulness of this unex-
pected vigour on the part of the masses, has
been loud and long, and terribly vociferous.
Boycotting, as yet, is, comparatively speaking,
only in its infancy ; but it is already recognised
as the one rough form of human justice against
which wealth offers ilo protection. It is im-
personal and intangible, and in this lies the
secret of its strength. A personal opponent
can be bought and a tangible enemy can be
bribed or sold, but a universal interdict can no
more be undermined than old age or death itself.
It is the tremendous force of public opinion put
into action, instead of spending itself in empty
words ; and the race which has hithe: to grown
fat and prospered upon general execration natu-
rally protests against a system which makes
execration a reality, and demands that people
should be prohibited from disliking them by
Act of Parliament, and that general aversion
should be suppressed by statute.
* * *
As we have already implied, boycotting is a
sinful and immoral expedient. It matters so
very little whether it is immoral or not that
this point may be conceded in order to econo-
mise time and space and printer’s ink. Most
things are immoral to a greater or less degree,
and the world expends a great part of its time
in doing evil that good may come. The rest of
its time is spent in doing evil that evil may
come. The only Man who avoided both these
expedients was crucified as a consequence, but
the human race has no desire for general cruci-
fixion, and when it is face to face with two
great difficulties its ambition is to choose the
less. Boycotting is a smaller disaster than
civil war or riot or hopeless anarchy, and this
fact alone is a sufficient justification of its exist-
ence. It was originally invented by the rich
for the oppression of the poor, and it is a fair
example of the irony of fate that the poor should '
at length find it a convenient weapon against
the rich' The Saxon or Norman or mediaival
English nobleman who could not lay his hands
on his enemy and hang him on an ad jacent tree,
promptly obtained a sentence of outlawry
against him, and from that moment not only
was he boycotted in all his social relations, bub
even his life was at the disposal of anyone who
was strong enough to take it. The Catholic
Church, which now curses its own favourite
system as practised in Ireland, improved on the
rough-and-ready practice of earlier days and
brought it to a lofty state of perfection. The
much-execrated King John, who, despite all
his atrocities, invariably stood by the people
against their baronial oppressors, found his
entire following reduced to seven men when
the Papal fiat of excommunication went
forth against him; and then the astounded
world witnessed the spectacle of a lonely
monarch declaring war single-handed against
Heaven, the Church, and the entire fighting
strength of the nation, and writing on his
banners this comprehensive order; “lam the
enemy of God, without pity and without
mercy. ” The system of political and religious
proscription was the application of the boycott
in its widest and most expansive sense, and it
was employed successively against Lollards,
Cavaliers, Covenanters, Catholics, Jacobites,
and disaffected Irishmen with the most gratify-
ing results. But when the nation had been
employed for many centuries in boycotting one
tyrant for the benefit of another, and in en-
forcing all manner of interdicts from which it
gained no benefit, it naturally grew accustomed
to the use of this convenient weapon, and when
it resolved to apply it for its own profit a howl
of execration went up and split the listening
heavens, and the hideous evils of the grand old
system became suddenly apparent.

An effective boycott is the expression of the
will of the majority, for a minority, unless
backed up by physical violence or some
other extraneous force, can never enforce such
an interdict. No doubt it is a lamentable cir-
cumstance that any section of humanity should
be coerced merely by reason of its numerical
inferiority, but it is one of the unhappy results
of an imperfect social system that the minority
always is coerced more or less. Every section
of mankind is haunted with a desire to impose
its views on its fellow-creatures, and therefore
in matters where it is impossible for the Govern-
ment to adopt a policy of toleration and steer
clear of both issues, the majority must rule—if
it does not, the minority certainly will. If one
section of the nation demands war and the other
calls for peace, the weaker party must give
way ; and if the stronger faction makes a con-
spicuous ass of itself, as it very frequently does,
the evil cannot be remedied by handing over the
power of the State to the minority, that faction
being quite as devoid of intelligence as the other.
The contest between Labour and Monopoly is
simply civil war carried on with moral instead of
material weapons, and each party endeavours
to the utmost of its ability to cut off the supply
of munitions to its opponent. In the ruder
forms of internecine strife which prevailed
before strikes and boycotting were adopted, and
which will prevail again it strikes and boy-
cotting are abolished by violent means before
they have run their course, the individual
who furnished assistance in any form to the
enemy was promptly executed, if sufficient force
was available to carry out the sentence. To-
day he is interdicted instead, and if there is force
enough at command to carry out the interdict
it is a definite proof that the majority are
against him. No doubt it is painful to be
crushed by a majority, but unless the monopolist
can bring forth evidence to show that the process
of being crushed by a minority is any less
disastrous to the sufferer the world may as well
accept one evil as the other.

The Argus, as the most prominent supporter
of cash as against mere humanity, denounces
the whole system of Trades-Unionism as a
hidden tyranny working in the dark, and de-
mands that some honourable system of open
warfare should be substituted in place of the
mean, underhand conspiracy at present in
vogue
The abhorred council of ten, which held the citizens of
Venice in fear and bondage, was not so minute and
microscopic in its tyranny as to follow the humblest
worker, who chose to be employ ed, into his own home
with threats of starvation. Wherever there is a secret
authority there is tyranny, and this is precisely the claim
which the Trades-hall is now putting forward, and trying
to enforce at the expense both of the workmen and the
public.
Truly the monopolist is wise in his generation.
Open warfare of the kind which he admires is a
species of strife in which victory goes with the
side which can buy an expensive big gun and
hire a mercenary battalion. It is a battle of
money rather than of numbers, and in the old
days, when Labour knew no method of assert-
ing its rights, except by sending a motley horde
of unarmed peasantry into the field, it was
swept away in a palsied rout by the handful of
tyrants clad in mail, who joyfully appealed to
the God of Battles because he was their own
god and they had constructed him them-
selves. Any other form of warfare is denounced
as un-English, because, as England can raise
more money than any other country on earth
with which to conduct a campaign, this par-
ticular form of warfare is the one in which she
is most certain to come out uppermost. And
boycotting, in particular, is anathematised as a
cowardly mode of assassination in the dark,
because it affords no feasible opportunity for a
man who possesses a gun to settle a great moral
problem in his own favour by shooting two men
who do not. When the feeble, half-armed, half-
trained Egyptian endeavoured to assert himself
openly against the capitalist who charged him
an unheard-of percentage and flogged him when
he was unable to pay, he was abused in the
first place and shot and hanged in the second,
and the case was promptly decided against him
after his decease. He had no chance from first
to last, but he rose up in a- nobly English
manner and was executed and buried for doing
it. If the Australian unionist would rise up in
the same fashion he would come to. the same end,
should the Permanent Artillery and the other
stays and props of Capital prove numerous and
docile enough to bring that result about. Also, he
would be cursed after death just as he is cursed
to-day because lie adopts judicious measures to
remain alive. The monopolist who calls upon
him to arrest himself in an open and manly
fashion would rush at him with cavalry and
infantry the instant he responded to the appeal,
and under these circumstances it is probably
as well to let his hereditary enemy denounce
him as a secret conspirator, or any other oppro-
brious term that comes handy, and take no
notice.
* # *
Probably the heaviest accusation brought
against the system of boycotting is that it is
apt to hit the just and the unjust promiscuously,
and to injure all manner of persons who are
only connected in the most remote manner with
the original dispute. It is hardly worth while
to discuss this question. If the .accusation be
groundless, it is only one falsehood among a
countless number ; if it be true, we would be
glad to know if any action was ever done by
man in war or peace which was not open to the
same objection. The capitalist who grows rich
does it by leaving some one else in poverty.
The honoured patriot who goes forth with a gun
to whoop for his country amid public applause
straightway shoots some unfortunate who has
been forced into the field to fight for a precarious
income of fourpence a day in a quarrel from
which he receives no possible benefit, or else he
wildly blows the head off some unarmed
spectator who is present by accident. Peace
may be a good thing, but it is bad for the
soldier who seeks honour and promotion. Uni-
versal prosperity is no doubt desirable, but
many a respectable official assignee would be
ruined thereby. Life is a valuable institution,
but too much of it would be rough on many an
expectant heir, and would reduce annuity
societies to desolation, and leave the esteemed
undertaker penniless. When a mysterious
Providence made disease contagious instead of
health it inflicted countless sufferings on the
innocent, and even the most rampant trades-
unionist has never claimed to know more than
Providence, or to be more infallible than the
Divinity. The complaint of the capitalistic
press merely amounts to a declaration that the
Trades Hall is not a heaven-born institution
presided over by the seraphim, and this much
the w-orld knew already. And if the methods
of defence adopted by that body contain some
accidental element of injustice they share that
objection with everything else of mere earthly
origin from monarchy down to the retail prawn
industry, and will probably continue to do so to
the end.

According to certain worm-eaten statutes
which George the Imbecile bequeathed to his
well-beloved empire, the devices of trades-
unionism were declared to be illegal, and boy-
cotting in particular—then described as intimi-
dation or unlawful combination—was conspiracy
of a dark and malevolent type. And no doubt
it will be discovered on due inspection that some
venerable and mouldered enactment still sur-
vives which will fit this case, and afford suffi-
cient grounds for vigorous measures of repres-
sion. Also under the same statute will be found
ample justification for the arrest of every pro-
minent financier in Australia for conspiring to
organise various land, gold, and silver booms to
the great detriment of deluded investors, and
abundant scope for the imprisonment of every
prominent teetotaller on a charge of associating
to compass the financial ruin of certain reput-
able citizens lawfully engaged in the sale cf
beer, whisky, rum, and other compounds war-
ranted to deteriorate the human interior as
authorised by Act of Parliament; also for the
indictment of a large number of mine-owners
and others for conspiracy to boycott by locking-
out. In a country where a thousand dif-
ferent conspiracies are perpetually in full blast,
it is hardly worth while to inquire if one more
has been added to the number. A sanitary law
which passes by a ton of offal to hunt with a
microscope for one imaginary germ in the
gutter, is too lopsided and impotent to be of
much account. The Boycott is the weapon of
both Monopoly and Labour just now. The
employer boycotts the clerk who refuses to
become a special constable for the coercion of
Labour, just as the Unionist boycotts the
“ blackleg,” and just as the attorney boycotts
the barrister whom he detects in the perfectly
legal, but unconventional, act of allowing a
client to personally consult him.
The Odd Halfpenny.
“What have we to do with these disputes
between the men and their masters?” asks “the
public,” when asked to pay more for their
butter or coals. “It is no concern of ours, and
why should we have to buy our butter at three-
and-six a pound ? ” But it is our concern : we
have to do with it. We are all responsible for
this fight. If the real contending parties could
be brought face to face, on one side would be all
those now actively engaged in the struggle, the
wharf-labourer shoulder to shoulder with the
wharf-owner, the shearers rank and rank with
the squatters, lumper and stevedore, shipowner
and stoker all arranged under the one banner,
and on the other side would be massed the
entire force of our social system, down to
the last child. At bottom it is not a
struggle between employers and employed ; it
is a revolt against social conditions. If any
workman in the community is getting
less than a fair wage, if any producer is pre-
vented from taking his due share of the wealth
he produces, the wdiole of us must assume the
responsibility. The capitalist, the man who
pays the labourer, is only an intermediary ; the
community at large is the real and ultimate
employer, and wherever there is oppression it
is the community at large that is the oppressor.
We grow apoplectic with indignation when
we hear of a starving sempstress making
shirts at a penny-farthing apiece and find-
ing her own thread. For one day and part
of another we howl for the blood of the
merciless sweater, and then a charity ball inter-
venes, and we go off to take our guinea’s worth
out of the champagne ; so the starving sempstress
goes on making -spirts at a penny farthing a
piece and finding her own thread. And she
will go on doing- it so long as- she has only the
awakened conscience and sympathy of the com-
munity to look to for relief.
# # #
Conscience and sympathy ao great havoc
occasionally with the community’s heart, but
they find it very hard to work down as low as
the pockets. The fact is, we are all too much
in the swim ; we are in partnership with the
the sweater. He gives us our shirts cheap, and
we are too careless, too selfish, perhaps too poor
through the over-competition of our fellow-
clerks or tradesmen, or artisans, to employ the
poor sempstress direct and pay her a good price
The central principle of our social economy-!,
the cardinal dogma of our creed—the bottom
plank of the whole civilised structure—is never
to give a shilling for the thing you can buy at
elevenpence-halfpenny, never to worry about
whether we shop before six o’clock or after
ten. The odd halfpenny is the most crushing
and brutal force that has been evolved in the
blood-stained history of the human race. It j s
the engine that turns every wheel in the grind-
ing mill of free competition ; it is the curse of
the workman and workwoman who have only
their labour to sell. The manufacturer who
would keep up his head in the struggle f or
existence is forced by it to cut down the
cost of production to the limit of possibility ;
drives the labourer, who would succeed in the
competition for a day’s work, to sell his labour
at the lowest price of the thinnest plank that
can stand between a human being and the abyss
of starvation. So long as labourer strives with
labourer for the chance to earn bread, so long
the manufacturer can oppress them if he will •
so long as the manufacturer is between the mill-’
stones of competition, he must oppress them if
he can. Over both, with upraised whip, stands
a relentless slave-driver—“the public”—that
steadily refuses to give a shilling for the thing
it can buy at elevenpence-halfpenny. It is the
odd halfpenny that does it all; and before the
social warfare can be stopped, we must rid our
system of that odd halfpenny. It will give
nineteenth century civilisation a jolt to make
its backbone rattle, but it must be done.
Abelard, Second Edition.
It would be as well for the clergy as a body if
they sought to cultivate a sense of humour
sufficiently strong to prevent them from osten-
tatiously presenting the weak and ludicrous
side of their profession to a cold and cynical
public. Women, whose credulity is to-day the
clergy’s only real prop and mainstay, as a rule
take such a hard and practical view of life when
the glamour of love’s young dream has vanished,
that from the ranks of womanhood neither a
Charles Lamb nor a Mark Twain is ever likely
to arise. The average parson attunes his music
to the key-note of the feminine lyre. There is
a latent sympathy between the softer sex and
the unnamed sex represented by the clergy into
which an ordinary man may not enter. A real
healthyman of bone, blood and muscle and brains,
regards the average clergyman as something he
cannot quite understand—the pastor may, in
rare cases, be a self-sacrificing fanatic, a crank,
and, therefore, worthy of our respect ; if not,
he must be a humbug, preaching doctrines up
to one part of which he obviously does not live,
and which, so far as the other part is concerned,
the universal sense of the age has long since
laughed to scorn. Women have a kindly feeling
for the priestly office, and, as men are mostly
governed by women, the clergy are allowed a
latitude in their social relations with the sex
which is not allotted to ordinary men. Occasion-
ally they are detected in overstepping their
privileges, and then with ostentatious prudery
their brethren cast the black sheep into outer
darkness.

Such a case has happened lately, and the
Presbytery of Sydney has been so unbusiness-
like as to make public the unedited confession
of the offender. We have no wish to add any-
thing to the anguish that the ex-Revereml
Andrew Gardiner alleges he is suffering, but
we must draw attention to the manner in which
the hypocrisy of the preacher clings to the man,
even after he has defied the conditions of his
office. Adam, the first sneak on record, went
the whole hog and accused Eve of being the
chief culprit, in the apple-stealing case. Mr.
Gardiner stops short of this. He mercifully
and considerately says : “ I do not at all blame
the young lady whose name has unfortunately
been involved in this sad case of mine, nor her
relatives, who were entirely ignorant of any
wrong, nor any other person.” Generous,
magnanimous and much-to-be-pitied man! After
having, in the words of the Presbytery, been
“ guilty of acts of criminal intimacy on repeated
occasions, with a member of his congrega-
tion, a Sabbath-school teacher,” he snufflingly
says he does not blame the woman ! A
greaterthan Joseph has appeared and proclaimed
himself before men. This disgraced clergy-
man, who 'has not the common courage to
remain silent and accept his punishment like a
white man, dared to ask that he might be per-
mitted to remain in the Church, once more to
be accorded the exceptional and dangerous pri-
vileges with women that custom has allowed
the parson, and states that he thinks he could
serve God better for the experience of sin that
he has passed through. Experieniia docet, says
Parson Gardiner. You bet it does !
# # #
The dominion of the clergy, so largely
exercised over women, must inevitably come
to grief if many more such confessions are
to be made public. The tale in itself is bad
enough, and has been reproduced since the
days of Abelard ; but the smug assurance
with which the present transgressor seeks
to be retained in his priestly vocation
is absolutely original. In most men—men
whom the late Reverend would probably despise
as publicans and sinners—there is a sense of
honour towards women, who, after all, bear the
heaviest burden of the guilt, which would re-
strain them from uttering the suggestive plea that
they might, if they liked, “explain matters;’
but with a man bred in an atmosphere of cant,
such a healthy mood is impossible. He con-
fesses, but snivels while he does so. For the
sinner we can have pity, for the sneak none,
nor for the system that bred him.
* * *
There are some beautiful words written by a
poet, whom, perhaps, the late Reverend never
read. They express the lament of LaunukloT


he brave, but sinning man, who betrayed his
friend
I would languish thus in some loathsome den,
As a thing of naught in the eyes of men,
In the mouths of men as a by-word

To the darkest depth of the nethermost pit,
If hers could be wafted skyward.
perhaps the next shepherd who goes wrong

a - c k to the girl, and not apologise for her in so
left-handed a way. The victim in such a case
requires all the manly sympathy she can get.

A Rent Revolt.
Tk most great centres the complexities of civili-
sation have so obscured all economic questions
. the cobwebs of inequitable laws and the
ramifications of ideas whose primary growth
m aV be traced backward among the dust of by-
gone centuries, that even careful thinkers, fail-
ing to disentangle thought from the maze of
external surroundings, seem to imagine that
whatever is must be right,- and that the pre-
vailing systems of production and distribution
are eternal verities instead of mere passing re-
lations in social and economic evolution. It
has, therefore, happened that peoples living
under what may be relatively termed primitive
conditions have been the foremost to recognise
dearly dominant injustices and to devise
methods, simple but effective, for their aboli-
tion. For instance, in Ireland, where rent in
proportion to production was, mayhap is, as one
to four, tenants are in direct communication
with landlordism, or at least its agents ; and,
unable to live as human beings should
while punctually meeting their exorbitant
demands, they discovered and made use of
that method of resistance, chiefly passive, which
consists in retaining the home while ignoring
the landlord’s claims. We refer, of course, to
that weapon of the weaponless which has been
styled the No Rent Campaign. Everywhere,
thinkers are beginning to realise that these
simple methods admit of wider application :
to-day, the worker in many lands contemplates
the stealing of Hibernian thunder, a wielding in
crowded cities of those weapons that were forged
and pointed at peat fires in the smoky cabins of
Refund. # * *
In this connection we may appropriately quote
some sentences from the communication of a
correspondent (formerly a member of the Queens-
land Assembly), who writes to us from London
as follows :
It appears certain that the Socialist organisations will
shortly counsel the adoption of the No Rent Manifesto as
a basic part of their plan of campaign, with a view to
harrying landlords so effectually that they will gladly
resign their rents and roods to the State in return for
moderate compensation. To-day, in Central London, at
least a third of the wage-earner’s income is grabbed by
the land-thief as rent, and many of those who do not
believe that the earth is the landlord’s and the fullness
thereof, boldly assert that the striker who pays rent
simply supplies the funds that enable the monopolise to
resist his demands. At a moment when the rottenness of
existing conditions is made apparent by the daily de-
nunciations, written and oral, of the leaders of the many
organisations of the discontented, it is not difficult to
forsee coming social eruptions Let me predict
that the revolutions of the future, as compared with their
predecessors, will be almost bloodless.
# * #
The era has come when land-nationalisers everywhere w ill
begin to carry their theories into practice without waiting
for the aid of lagging governments. Now, it the No Rent
weapon be a powerful one where population is scattered
and houses one-storied, and where the atrocious cruelty,
inseparable from forcible eviction is, so far as five actual
eye of the world is concerned, hidden, what will it be
where many houses are many-storied, closely-packed and
densely populated? Picture to yourself, oh, my imagina-
tive friend, the attempt to evict forty families from a
barracks, provisioned in readiness by the Socialist Leagues,
in a »London slum. The storming of the roughly-
erected barricades at each end of the narrow street,
followed by the arrival of the landlord’s agents outside
the beleaguered house, from whose upper windows are
dropped all sorts of hot, heavy and filthy articles on the
heads of the besiegers amid the yells of the thousands
that have assembled to support the tenants and execrate
the landlord and his minions. Then the long-delayed
entrance of the evictors ; the struggle in the narrow and
gloomy staircases; the tardy triumph of authority fol-
lowed by the forcible dumping down of two or three
hundred people, old and young, many of them in various
stages of starvation, disease and decay, in the gutter
with their miserable belongings—belongings none the less
valuable to them because of decrepitude and meagreness.
Conceive all this repeated and i'e-repeated a thousand times
on a greater or larger scale in a thousand different localities
while all the world rings with the cabled recital. What
then ? Even if such buildings could be readily levelled to
the ground, it would not pay the owners to remove them,
and the unroofing of lofty houses will not deter the home-
less from the occupancy of the lower stories, and so ere
morning, probably, most of the evicted will again be re-
instated by some means in the wretched dens they have
sanctified by the holy appellation of home. Perhaps the
military, already inclined to mutiny, is at that period
called out, and, their sympathies being with their
down-trodden brethren, they refuse to “uphold law
and order.” . . . Should discipline, however, triumph
over personal feelings, coercion may percipitate what
has been, hitherto, mainly passive resistance into armed
revolt. Railroads, bridges, and public buildings are de-
stroyed, thoroughfares everywhere are impeded, and a few
armed and desperate men firing from masked windows on
each side of a narrow street would decimate the finest regi-
ment that ever glistened on parade. . . But I don’t think it
would ever come to that. With ruin staring them in the
face, the landlord and monopolist would rather accept
moderate compensation than continue to retain the
parchment titles to valueless properties. One of
our great London landlords publicly stated, not
long ago, that the working man is a fraud ! When
all the pinched toilers who inhabit his rookeries cease to
hand over a large proportion of their incomes to his agents
in order that he may he enabled to live at luxurious ease
while abusing them, then it will he made evident to him,
as if written on the sky-line by the finger of the Almighty,
that toiling men and women were hot created for his
especial benefit, that he is “ the fraud” who, during life,
performs no publicly beneficial duties, and that the shady
side of Cleveland-street is a mighty hard road to travel for
the man who is compelled to hustle for a living and
doesn’t exactly know how to set about it.

More Local Forces.
The pertinacity with which a peaceful, podgy,
middle-aged bourgeoisie attempts to cultivate a
“ military spirit ” in Australia is beyond the
limits of a joke. As the possibility of foreign
invasion becomes more and more remote, so the
I'odsnapian craving for a standing army seems
to increase. More soldiers, shrieks .pompous
Respectability, arc required to strengthens the
hands of the Government ; and as the hands of
Australian Governments in general are just now
clenched in the face of Trades Unionism, the
necessity for strengthening those otlicial paw is
more imperative than usual. Especially in
Victoria does the bourgeoisie desire for men in
buckram, as instruments of suppression, call
for some practical protest from that vast
majority of the people to whom the sight of
a scarlet coat is objectionable. Last week
the Mayor of St. Kilda - a , Melbourne
suburb where sassiety musters strong —called a
meeting for the purpose of raising a special
amateur cavalry corps among the gilded youth
of that high-toned locality. The idea had been
mooted in a hysterical moment of alarm, when
the labourers on strike were alleged to be medi-
tating a bloodthirsty attack upon property and
a wholesale slaughter of the monopolistic inno-
cents. Seeing, however, that no rising has
occurred in the meantime, and that workmen
earning no wages were creating far less dis-
turbance than employers bereft of their profits,
the Mayor was forced to explain to his fat
friends in the public meeting assembled that a
cavalry corps ‘ ‘ was unnecessary for the purpose
of maintaining order in the streets,” at which
a portion of the limited assemblage shook its
influential bald head, and suggested that they
ought to be prepared for the worst. By way of
compromise, the Mayor then proposed that
St. Kilda should raise a kind of King’s
Own mob of horsemen “ for the Governor’s
special service.” This doubly deplorable scheme
is significant of the inseparable connection
that exists between militarism and grovel. The
original excuse for raising more army being no
longer available, the Mayor’s thoughts turned
towards his Excellency, who, according to the
greasy civic fiction, has urgent need of a troop
of cavaliers for his own special service. Just
here Major-General Tulloch chipped in with
some expert evidence to the effect that foot-
soldiers were of more use (ye gods !) than
cavalry in this country, so it would be well if
the officers of the new toady brigade also quali-
fied themselves to servo in an infantry regiment,
that they might, doubtless, be able to fight the
masses on foot if necessary. It was finally
decided to enroll recruits under these condi-
tions, and nothing now remains but for
Lord Hopetoun to discover some species of
special service suited to his bodyguard. There
can lie no sense in his having a vice-regal
cavalry corps without giving the gallant fellows
something to do. They will have to establish a
lucid system of surrounding the little lordling
on all public occasions, and the necessity for
building a barracks on the grounds of Govern-
ment House is obvious. But this is merely a
matter of detail. A main point for consideration
by the Victorians at large is whether the time
has arrived for protesting against any further
arming of young noodles who can have no pos-
sible use for weapons save to turn them against
their poorer brethren whenever Monopoly works
itself up into a blue funk. Are the uppah
classes to go on enrolling themselves as special
constables and special swashbucklers ‘ ‘ for the
Governor”?

A Hint to the Par West.
The new West Australian constitution is com-
ing out by gravel-train or some other protracted
means of locomotion, and on its arrival the
colony is to start on a new basis, as a full-blown
State with an Assembly of its own, and a
nominee Chamber of life-long encumbrances
which it would gladly have dispensed with.
Nobody in Western Australia was particularly
desirous of possessing an Upper House, but it
was considered necessary that that old, irre-
moyeable disease should be bestowed upon the
inhabitants lest they should become too happy.
It is to be composed chiefly of the defeated
candidates at the first General Election, it being
assumed that because a man is regarded as
unfit to legislate for a brief term of years he is
therefore eminently qualified to boss the con-
cerns of his country for the period of his natural
life ; and when the supply of cast-off politicians
runs short, the vacancies will be filled up by the
derelict policemen of the past regime and the
used-up nominees who are left over from the
convict era. There is an abundance of excellent
material on hand out of which to construct this
new aristocracy, and when the old, bounceable
nobles are gathered together there is a pros-
pect of a healthy and enlivening scrimmage for
supremacy. A great deal depends on whether
the Lower House hits the Upper with sufficient
vigour at the start, and scares the misfit
oligarchs into prompt submission; if it fails
in the performance of this duty trouble is
inevitable. The fact that the “ Lords ” possess
a life-long authority, while the popular repre-
sentatives have only an ephemeral existence,
generally fills the nominee Chamber with a
deranged idea of its own importance which can
only be taken down by judicious and well-
directed violence. If Western Australia intends
to smooth the path of progress and avoid future
misconstruction, it should begin its new career
by impressing on its superfluous peerage that
the dignity of the Upper House doesn’t amount
to anything, and that the House itself had better
crawl under the bed and keep out of sight.
The Upheaval of the Cheap Clei’k.
The following unutterable hog wash is solemnly
published by the Brisbane A kek ;
As for the clerks, they have shown a sublime example
of loyaltv to the interests of their employers. . The
spectacle is grand. While the Trades Unions arc using
their utmost efforts to starve into submission the com-
panies which have found them work for years, the brave
and loyal clerks have soiled their soft, white hands with
the sweat and dirt of arduous-toil. Never were soiled
hands more honourable. Never was fealty more
admirable. Never did honest zeal earn a nobler guerdon.
Heaven be praised that the claptrap of federated labour
communism has not yet extinguished the noble qualities
of'gratitude, fidelity and fortitude. -
This is truly the apotheosis of the deified quill-
driver. Columbus discovering a New World
was only an insignificant spectacle after all.

skip with, and he was young and active and
had a fair chance in a long stern chase with the
police, and failing an answer to this question he

On Bail.
When an affluent citizen treads on the dignity
of the Law—which he frequently does —and is
arrested in consequence —which doesn’t often
take place—the first business of his lawyer is to
get him released on bail. When a lawyer ap-
plies for bail on behalf of the defendant, the
chances of getting it are a good deal better than
if the defendant applied himself; and when the
same eloquent authority points out that the
bail is excessive, and ought to be reduced, the
prospects of a reduction are considerably greater
than if John Jones, partially drunk and sus-
pected of being lazy, put in the same plea in
Ids private capacity, and wanted the concession
on his own account. Unless the affluent citizen
has committed homicide in open daylight, and
is afterwards found walking down the street
with an axe over his shoulder and brains on the
edge of it, it is very seldom indeed that this
little commercial transaction fails to go through
to the satisfaction of all parties concerned ; and
when we consider how very rarely the defendant
fails to appear when wanted, there can be no
possible objection to the system. But in the
case of the humble artizan, who is suspected of
having pawned a stolen chisel or a pair of em-
bezzled boots in order to quench his thirst, bail
is often a matter of difficulty. The other man
can easily hire someone to go security for him,
and pay him out of the money that has gone
amissing in the bank or the building society,
but the smaller offender, having only stolen
enough for immediate requirements, has no
Such resources at his command. Owing to the
elaborate system in vogue in the police force,
by which the cheap, unconsidered “ suspect” is
arrested without evidence, and then remanded
from week to week till some facts can be hunted
■up, and kept in prison the while so that he can’t
collect any information to confute the charges
brought against him, it is a matter of common
occurrence for the less important criminal to be
locked up for nine or ten weeks while waiting
for a sentence of three months imprisonment ;
and having virtually served three-fourths of his
sentence already, because of his poverty, he has
then to start afresh and serve it all over again.
Now and then a judge, who is furnished with
more brains and sympathy than the majority of
his tribe, professes to take this circumstance
into consideration, but such instances are ex-
ceedingly rare, and they form a haphazard
system of justice at the best. The only
equitable scheme which can be devised is to
enact that in every case where a conviction is
obtained the term of imprisonment imposed
shall commence from the day when the accused
was first confined on suspicion, the period which
he has spent in prison while awaiting trial thus
counting as part of the final sentence. Under
any other plan the system of granting bail is
merely a device whereby the affluent offender is
allowed to purchase partial immunity for his
crimes, and this legalised corruption has become :
so common that few, even among unprejudiced
observers, appear to be impressed with its
glaring iniquity. And at the best it is only
possible to find a remedy for part of the evil,
for in cases where no conviction ensues the poor
defendant has suffered probably as long a term
of imprisonment before it is discovered that he
should never have been imprisoned at all, as if
actually found guilty, while the rich one has
merely endured the passing inconvenience of
having to hunt up an affluent friend to
sign a document on his behalf ; but in a world
where justice has always been bought and sold,
and will continue to be bought and sold till the
day of doom, absolute equity is too hopeless to
be worth dreaming about. The wealthy offender
who is out- on bail is generally able, unless he is
an ass-of the first water, to buy enough evi-
dence to prove his innocence even when he is
undoubtedly guilty ; the poor defendant whom
nobody will go bail for has to lie helpless in
prison while the police hunt up a profusion of
fluent testimony to prove his guilt even when
lie is certainly innocent. It lias always been so,
and will continue to be so to the end, and it
• would be an outrage on the British constitution
if it were otherwise. But the small reform we
have suggested can lie carried into effect with-
out violating that fundamental principle which
declares that it doesn’t matter whether a person
who lias no money and no influence is in gaol or
out of it, and so long as this treasured axiom is
not trodden on it may be safely presumed that
t he empire will continue to prosper and hold its
own.
“Go Slow.”
Whenever the world shows an unlooked-for
tendency to move ahead, the monopolistic' press
rises to point out that motion is a good thing in
the abstract, and to urge the necessity of going-
slow. The scheme for the establishment of
boards of conciliation, the proposition that the
Eight Hours’ System should be enforced by
legal enactment, and various other socialistic
proposals arising out of the present crisis, have
called forth from the organs of Property the old,
piteous appeal concerning the evils of hasty
legislation. The dream of Land Nationalisation
has also received a certain amount of hazy, un-
certain support even from the journals which
represent landlordism in its worst forms, but
the support has in every case been hampered
by a tacit agreement that the world is to go un-
speakably slowly. The scheme is a great and
magnificent one, but,"owing to the evils of velo-
city, it is to l)e postponed till the nations have
gone through a ponderous process of prepara-
tion ; and when at some unfathomably remote
period of the future the human mind is ripe for
the change then it may prove advisable to con-
sider the possibility of starting afresh on a new
and better basis. Even Burdekin, that mighty
landlord, was able to meet the erstwhile apostle
of confiscation on a friendly footing when Mr.
George so far backed down from his original,
position as to agree that his grand reform should
be affected deliberately and with much fore-
thought—in short, that the world should go
slow over it—so slow that neither Burdekin
nor any of Burdekin’s descendants were likely
to be injured by the much-postponed revolution.
The disasters which arise from insensate haste
—the necessity for calm consideration—Mho
fearful results of revolutionary impatience—the
demand for “well-weighed changes” —are the;
stock phrases of modern Toryism. It seldom
is so foolish as to denounce a popular reform in
direct or unmistakable language ;■ it merely
points out that the time is not yet ripe for itu
accomplishment. And happily the time never
seems to become ripe; the changes arc never
sufficiently “weighed;’’ and after a lifetime of
placid consideration things remain just when;
they were. Every reform which was ever pro -
pounded has been met by some slow-going
obstructionist who urged that the matter shoulu
be dealt with in that inexpressibly gradual
manner which is indicative of true wisdom :
and when, centuries later, the long-dels)ted pro-
ject became a reality, the original obstructionist s
great-great-very-great-grand-descendant lias in-
variably been found at his post, pointing out,
as his ancestor did before him, the absolute,
necessity of prolonged thought, and calling on
the world to go slow. This prophetic cry
against over-hasty legislation is one of the coin-
pletest of all empty devices. The abuses o f
to-day are mostly as old as man himself, ami if
a hundred thousand years or more of profouuu
contemplation has not left the world ripe for
action then it is time that some one among the
apostles of stagnation should point out when
the time of action is likely to come. The curse
of land monopoly was already ancient when the
pyramids were unbuilt, and when the first
glimmer of the oldest known civilisation was
dawning under the shadow of the Himalayas ;
and if the world requires to sit down to-day
and consider whether it is a curse after all,
then sixty centuries of experience count for
nought; and if sixty centuries have pro-
duced absolutely nothing, then six hundred
centuries more may v eil be wanted before the
world, travelling at its accustomed pace,
is fit to arrive at any definite conclusion. The
horrors of a social system which concentrates
the world’s wealth in the hands of a few and
leaves the masses in poverty was a worn-out
theme before Solomon and Confucius and
Hermes of Egypt were in existence, yet the
latter-day monopolist denounces the insensate
haste of Socialism and Trades-Unionism to undo
these venerable wrongs, and calls upon the
world to go slow. The world has gone very
slow in matters of reform ever since the Crea-
tion, and the time lias surely arrived to impart
some measure of velocity to its movements if its
future is to lie any better than its past. War
and annexation, it is true, have travelled fast ;
so have bigotry, and superstition, and conquest,
and land-grabbing, and the collection of tithes,
and coercion, and every other evil; but these
are things that require little consideration. No
wealthy landlord protested against the evils of
undignified speed when the Soudan butchery
was preparing, and the demand for calm con-
sideration speaks soft and very low if a Treason
Felony Act has got to be rushed through, but
when a venerable wrong is to be undone or
an ancient injustice repaired then the necessity
for at least a century of solemn reflection
becomes at once apparent. And at the end of
that century the Tory of the fortieth generation
will rise, as his ancestors did, and implore a
stagnant earth to go slow.
“ Whom Shall I Marry ? ”
Dear Bulletin, —You quote Lord Melbourne’s
remark —“ Before marriage the shape, the
figure, the complexion, carry all before them ;
after marriage, the mind and character unex-
pectedly claim their share, and that the largest,
of importance ” —as one .of the most sensible
things ever said about marriage. Thackeray—
a very reverent student of the sex—admits, in
one of his.verses, “The fairest lips that ever
were kiss’t might turn..away and never bo
miss’t, ere that even a month, (.of marriage) has
gone,” or words to the same effect. . Neverthe-
less, our old friend Corbett advised young men
to marry their conceptions of beauty, he main-
taining that the inevitable domestic tiff would
be.the sooner over if the husband were tempted
to “ make it up ”by a pretty face. Man is but
a weak, vain creature, like his wife, and the
comfort of knowing that the female half of his
firm cuts a pleasing figure before the public eye
is by no means inconsiderable. If Keats was
right in pronouncing a thing of beauty to be a
joy for ever, surely a “decent-looking ' woman
doesn’t lose all her physical value after'the
honeymoon has waned. Though this sentiment
may appear mean, paltry, vulgar to the tribe of
lisr.x, it is essentially {esthetic. When a man
genuinely admires his wife’s appearance, he is
the more likely to take her about and to become
what is commonly .called a good husband. , Tim


good husband, being much in his wife’s com-
pany, forms her mind, or she forms his, or per-
haps they each form a bit of the other’s.
Anyway, they stand a better chance of
cultivating “ two souls with but a single
thought,” &c., than do couples not joined
by a band of animal attraction. Lord Mur-
bourne —by the way, what the dickens
could he know about domestic life for the
million?—talks as old fogies have talked ever
since marriage was established, without exer-
cising the slightest influence over “engaged”
youngsters, nor amorous oldsters who generally
succeed in persuading themselves that their love
emanates from the mind, instead of from the
body. My Loxd M. doesn’t even appear to
know that after marriage the liver and digestion
claim a great lot of attention. There cannot be
much community of thought between the man
who is abroad all day and the woman who is
suffering from an everlasting headache upon his
return. Yes, after the nuptial glamour
has gone for ever, then the liver which
has been keeping dark off the weather-
bow, sails right in. Mind and character are of
great importance when discovered, but as often
as not they are so small as to be obscured
behind the personal appearance. Therefore, I
recommend the average young man to choose a
nice-looking girl, who takes a pride in her
boots, abhors frayed petticoats, keeps her ap-
pointments with him faithfully, and rejoices in
a first-class liver.— The Husband of a Pretty
Woman.

The fatal effects of morality were successfully
demonstrated a few weeks ago by a Board of
Guardians in the East End of London, and
Elizabeth Bryant, a widow of no public im-
portance, died as a natural consequence. She
was aged 63, and supported herself and a
paralysed son by sewing shirts all day and most
of the night. She kept on sewing shirts till
she broke down and became bedridden, and
then she sewed shirts in bed for 16 or 18 hours
per diem and earned 3s. 6d. a week in conse-
quence. She paid two shillings a week for the
rent of a dismal attic, and two human beings
dived on the other eightenpence as free and joy-
ful British subjects. Then she applied to the
parish for assistance, and the parochial hair
stood up in holy indignation when it learned
that she and her son shared a single apartment,
and Mrs. Bryant was severely admonished
about the sinfulness of this proceeding, and
informed that while it continued she could ex-
pect neither assistance nor recognition. As two
rooms would have cost four shillings per week,
and as the rules of arithmetic prevented four
shillings coming out of 3s. 6d., things remained
as they were, and the widow died of hunger,
leaving her paralysed heir on the floor to keep
her dead body company. Morality is a noble
institution, and must be kept up regardless of
expense, and yet there are times when a certain
amount of honourable sin seems to have a higher
effect somehow.
Now that the Presbytery has “deposed” Rev.
Andrew Gardiner, that gentleman may,
perhaps, follow the course adopted by a certain
well-known and fashionable Melbourne saint.
When, some thirty years ago, that godly man
“fell” (over the inevitable woman), and the
brethren got rid of him, he opened shop for
himself in a big hall, where each Sabbath he
held forth to a colossal congregation, the
attendance of women being enormous. The
Bulletin is ready to wager that (such is the
depravity of human nature) Mr. Gardiner can
now, if he choses to start business, easily fill the
biggest hall available, and put to shame his
successor in the pastorate of the Glebe kirk.
Had we but the time we’d take the reverend
gentleman under our managerial wing, lease
the big organ, and write for Mr. Gardiner an
eloquent lecture, entitled “Sunday-school
teachers I have met.” We cordially commend
the idea to R. S. Smytke. A giddy parson
draws like a divorced actress—just notice how
the clergy draw even when they are only sus-
pected of being giddy. Courage, brother!
Keep a stiff upperlip, hire a good manager, and
preserve a fearless gall.
An eighteen-years-immured convict in Darling-
hurst, who exists within hearing of the ocean
which he has never seen, was, as The Bulletin
has stated, a boy of 17 years when he committed
the deed for which he was sentenced to life-
imprisonment, but, then, the “System” says
he must not be released while there are others
longer in confinement than he—for instance,
Bertrand, now in Maitland prison. Minister
Clarke did once humanely endeavour to get
the New South Wales Parliament to fix a
definite time for the expiry of “life-sentences,”
but the House was not in the mood at the time,
or perhaps Sir Alfred Stephen, or his influence,
was in the way. In Victoria, a life-sentejice
means about 20 years, while “his natural life”
means that the wretch must end his days in
gaol. A few years since, a New South Wales
Judge, still on the Bench, sentenced a man to
be imprisoned for his natural life for man-
slaughter, thus utterly upsetting the intention
of the jury's verdict.
The New South Wales Full Court having given
judgment in favour of the Government in the
action brought by the London Chartered Bank
to recover the £6OOO overdraft “arranged” by
Hiddilston for his superior, the late Registrar-
General, without the latter’s authority, the
question naturally arises how far the legality of
Hiddilston’s conviction and ten-year sentence
is affected thereby. Hiddilston was convicted
of embezzling moneys of the Government, but
by the decision of the Full Court in the L.C.
Bank’s case it is clear that it wasn’t the money
of the Government he embezzled at all, but the
money of the bank. The Government don’t lose
a penny by Hiddilston, for every farthing he
is shown to have received by the books of the
Registrar-General’s office has been paid into the
cotters of the Treasury. As the case stands at
present it is what Jack Point would call “con-
tradiction contradicted.” The Government
prosecute and convict Hiddilston of em-
bezzling the lees taken at the Registrar-
General’s office, yet the Treasury books show
ihat every fee he is supposed to have
embezzled has been received by the Treasury.
The effect of the Full Court’s judgment is that
Hiddilston plundered the Bank and that the
Government, who received the booty, can
“stick to it.” There seems to be a pretty
general impression among laymen that the
receiver of stolen property has to hand it up to
the rightful owner, but it is very evident from
the judgment of the Full Court in the L.C. Bank
case that a difference is made when the receiver
is the Government. Had not the Government
had in Mr. Hiddilston such an enterprising
young financier they would now be lamenting
the absence of £6OOO Government fees in the
draft of next Financial Statement; and seeing
that the State has been held to be legally
entitled to Hiddilston’s booty, Treasurer
M‘Millan might do worse than appoint that
gentleman to the first consulting accountant-
ship that falls vacant at the Treasury.
Thus J. L. Purves, Q.C., when addressing the
A.N.A., Surrey Hills Branch, Vic., on the pre-
sent strike :—“ There were battles fought upon
principle, and to that extent they were noble
ones, but when they degenerated into exhi-
bitions of brute force they were ignoble ones.
It seemed to him an outrage that, in a civilised
country, matters which required delicate
adjustment should be decided either by famine
or endurance or a disregard of one’s duties."
Presumedly Mr. Purves, before delivering him-
self of this coolly audacious lecture, had rightly
gauged the mental calibre of his audience. A
little consistency is indispensable to good taste,
and the time is yet to come when the rationale
of brute force can be impartially treated by the
exponents of it. The “delicate adjustment”
referred to may, perhaps, not greatly incon-
venience such wealthy malcontents as the Pre-
mier Building Society or the Moss family, but
in view of the fact that the probable adjustors
had recently offered to contribute their moral
and monetary support to one party to the dis-
pute in question, the degraded masses are con-
strained to ask cross-examiner Purves to pass
on, please, and make room for the next exhibit'
Writes Richard North* R.N., in the S.M.
Herald :
The employers can hardly be sincere in their contention
that the affiliation of the Marine-officers with the Trades
and Labour Council would be subversive of discipline, for
it must be known to many of them that it is a fact that
many foremen in large engineering works and in the many
branches of the building trades are in the same societies
as the men working under them, and not simply affiliated
as is the case with the Officers’ Society, and that this has
no effect on the discipline. At least i never heard of any
instance where it did, and I've worked over 20 years in
different shops, in many of which the foreman were in
the same union as many of the men, nor have I ever seen
any favouritism shown towards a man because he belonged
to the same union as the foreman The real
cause of this unfortunate quarrel is that detestable spirit
of caste which refuses to see a fellow-man in a workman,
and resents the idea of arguing the matter out on an
equality, but says in effect “disarm yourselves and come
humbly before us and we may, out of the goodness of our
hearts and not as a matter of right, give you a few con-
cessions,” while to themselves they add, “and we will
starve you into submission if possible.”
Exactly. “Divide and Conquer” is the em-
ployers’ maxim.

W hen Andrew Geddes, the sincere Christian
who was short in his cash, was convicted at
Melbourne the other day, Messrs. Munro, Zox,
and four or five other well-known citizens, went
into the box to swear to his good character,
and as the result of their protestations that
shining teetotaller got off with three months.
The evidence of these witnesses amounted to a
declaration that they had never known the
prisoner to do anything bad—in other words,
Geddes admitted that he had taken the casli,
and his personal friends testified that they
hadn’t seen him take it, and that he ought to
be treated with special consideration in conse-
quence. Also they stated that he had always
been looked upon as a strikingly honourable
man, which either meant that he had been a
promising and successful hypocrite, or else that,
like every other criminal, he had reached his
present position by a gradual process of
deterioration. He hadn’t been born with his
cash short, in fact, but had become short by
degrees. Sundry touching allusions to his
benevolence were evoked in the course
of the proceedings, but no one seemed to
consider that benevolence in dispensing other
people’s money is only a second-rate virtue, and
is distinctly akin to that order of patriotism
which fights for its country until all its wife’s
relations are killed in the struggle. The sum
total of the narrative was that Mr. Geddes had
been such a good man in outward seeming that
he had been trusted with the cash, and that not
being a particularly good man in reality, the
said cash couldn’t be found afterwards, but that,
all the same, he should be judged by the
exploded semblance of the past, and not by the
reality of the present. The pathos that was
wasted over him amounted only to a declaration
that he had never been found out before, and
the same statement applies, at some time or
other, to every criminal. Embezzlement with-
out pious snuffle gets four years, and em-
bezzlement with snuffle gets three months, by
which it is demonstrated that snuffle is an
estimable quality in the eye of the law, and
worthy of all possible encouragement. For of
things like these the Kingdom of Heaven is
constructed.

Mr. Garvan says that when Parkes told him
that the Government had decided not to nomi-
nate on any account his (Garvan’s) leader,
Hums, as a New South Wales Opposition dele-
gate to the Federal Convention, and that they
had made up their mind to offer the position to
him (Garvan), he long wrestled with himself
and ultimately decided to accept the delegate-
ship on the ground that ‘ ‘ country came before
party.” Where Mr. Garvan went wrong (and
to this he owes the political misfortunes which
he now bewails) was in consenting to act as a
judge not only in his own cause, but in that of
his party. “ How could a man, even an avowed
Republican, resist the chance of becoming ‘ Sir
James Garvan, K.C.M.G.,’ for all the dele-
gates would be knighted?” ask Mr. Garvan’s
enemies. Mind you, The Bulletin doesn’t ask
this, but it quotes the remark with a view of
showing that a censorious world, which always
wants to know why its philanthropic friend
offers to soli his nice, showy horse so cheap, is
quite alive to the temptingness of the wedge-
shaped bait so adroitly offered to Mr. Gakvan
by the old gentleman who gets so many letters
from dukes and lords. Mr. Gakvan ought to
have known better.

Dear Bulletin, —One striking and cheering
feature of the meeting held last Saturday night
to protest against the Pension Fund Bill, which
the New South Wales Railway Commissioners
are trying to force upon the local railway men,
was the exception taken to members of Parlia-
ment being allowed to speak. Though the
chairman, who hopes to be an M.L.A. himself
some day, disallowed the point of order, yet
there was a strong minority in support of it,
and the incident shows that the Macquarie-
street title is rapidly losing its value as a name
wherewith to charm the workers. The latter
think —and not unreasonably—that the servants
should listen to the master. Consequently,
there is an increasing disposition not to tolerate
to any greater length than can possibly be
avoided the utterances of those who have
temporarily been placed “ above the salt.” As
to the proposed Provident and Pension Fund, it
is simply a sample of that capitalistic charity
which pays the workmen out in their own coin,
and which, with a little management, can be so
arranged as not to pay them even in that.
The employes, arguing from the known
effects of similar systems in other parts
of the world, anticipate that the pro-
posed fund will give the Commissioners a solid
grip of the men. If it were carried out, the
stereotyped formula would be, in all future
movements, “ The older employes disapprove of
the agitation.” (It was the “older employes”
in the London police-force whose efforts defeated
the justifiable strike lately organised by the
younger and more virile constables, and it is
the “older employes” in the Grenadier Guards
who are relied upon by the authorities to stifle
the complaints of their more manly but less
conservative juniors.) The Commissioners are
at present liable under the Employers Liability
Act. The fund, however, provides for a smaller
amount of compensation than does the Act, and
proposes, moreover, that the men shall provide
a large share of the money. The men, therefore,
do not ‘ ‘ see” the fund. To ascertain their
opinion on the matter, the Commissioners have
issued ballot-papers, on which employes must
openly record either an affirmative or a negative
—and sign also their names, addresses, and
occupations ! What humourists they must be
in the Chief Commissioner’s office !—A Railway
Man.
Next to the Prince.
“ Much excitement has been caused throughout
the Dominion of Canada [where excitement is
cheap, apparently. —Ed. B.] owing to the absence
of Cardinal Taschereau from the banquet given to
Prince George of Wales, who is visiting the
Dominion in command of HE.M.S. Thrush. The
absence of Cardinal Taschereau is said to have
been in consequence of the admiral and general
commanding the local naval and military forces
refusing to yield precedence to the Cardinal, who
desired to have the seat of honour next to Prince
George. ” —( Cablegram.)
Next to the Prince.
We slug of a Cardinal gentle and good—
An innocent lamb of the Lord,
Who takes what is plainest in liquor or food,
But likes the best place at the board ;
He turns up his eyes at a sybarite’s dish,
At “ fizz ” he will solemnly wince,
For nought that is rare does the Cardinal wish —
Except the seat next to the Prince.
He lately was asked to assist at a gorge,
A banquet of grovel and gush,
By “loyalists” tendered to Tummy’s son, George—
A kid who’s got over the Thrush;
The Cardinal promised to come and say grace
And swallow a mouthful of mince,
Provided they gave him his own proper place—
The place to the right of the Prince.
But a soldier and sailor of gaudy degree,
In garments of scarlet and gold,
Politely explained that they cared not a D.
Eor the finest old lamb in the fold.
At the sound of a trumpet and beat of a drum
Their swords they were ready to rinse
In anyone’s gore, so those toffs wouldn’t come
Unless they sat next to the Prince.
The Cardinal prayed, whilst the warriors swore,
And each took a coveted seat;
The servant of Heaven then walked to the door
And beat a strategic retreat;
The look of a martyr he wore on his face—
He cussed ’em in Latin words since
’Tvvas plain that his Master, in any such case,
Would bid him sit next to the Prince.
Of cardinal virtues ’tis pleasant to read;
At times they are mixed with a spice—
Intended to add to their flavour, indeed—
Of something like cardinal vice ;
And when this ascetic to Heaven shall flit
He’ll stagger St. Peter with hints
Respecting his pious pretensions to sit
On a cloud to the right of the Prince,
Summer is with us and the full-blooded
are advised to lower their temperature with
Marshall’s Tonic Nervine.

Dear Bulletin, —Your sketch of pig-

Normanby Island, off the coast of New Guinea,
have a simpler plan of making a pig into pork.
They tie his legs, “ fore and aft,” witli green
supplejack, run a pole through them, suspend him
about three feet from the ground, light a big lire
under him, which kills, singes hair off, and cooks
him in one act.—Yours, O. S. Boobke

“ Dandy Dick ” is and will be a “ big g 0 ”
at Sydney Criterion, but if produced at any other
than a sporting season, or in any other than a
sporting community, it would not prove so su c .
cessful. For its humour lies chiefly in the bandy,
ing about of slang by ladies, a baronet, a butler
and a dean, and the peculiar positions in which
the latter worthy deliberately places himself and
from which a word of explanation would speedily
extricate him. This is the story : A rural Dean
(Geo. Anson) having promised £IOOO for the reno-
vation of a churohspire, and while short of cash
takes to his home his widowed sister (Mrs,
Brough) whom he hasn’t seen for years, and is
shocked on arrival to find her clad like a man and
mannered like a jockey. Her entrance is followed
at a suspicious closeness by that of a sporting
baronet (E. 0. Corlesse) who has brought Dandy
Dick down to run for the local handicap
and the situation is further complicated
by the introduction of two Hussars (Prank
Cates and Cecil Ward) who come to court
the Dean’s daughters (Florence Hareourt and
Lillian Seccombe)and have encouraged them to run
into debt for fancy dresses for a yace-ball that
never takes place. Then the village-inn is burned
down, and Dandy Dick and his half-proprietor
(the sporting widow owns the other half) are
brought, willy-nilly, on to the ecclesiastical
premises. The Dean, who wants five hundred
pounds very badly, having discovered his ancient
butler (J. F. Cathcart) to be a betting man,
entrusts fifty pounds to him for outlay on his
sister’s nag. Then he becomes solicitous about
the horse’s welfare, mixes a ball to cure chills
(which is drugged by the butler), and is detected
while administering it, in disguise, by the trainer
(Owen Harris) and the constable (R. Brough) and
dragged to the local lock-up, where his old cook
(Annie Taylor), the policeman’s wife, excites
her husband’s jealousy by administering to
his comforts. Driven to the nearest gaol
in a cart, he is rescued by a three-card
crowd and returns home to he denounced as a
poisoner. Conscious of innocence, he prepares to
swallow the strychnined bolus—as did the wife in
“Fool’s Paradise ” —but is restrained by the guilty
butler, who has invested the dean’s money arid
that of the entire kitchen on Bonnie Betsy, who
was beaten easily by Dandy Dick. The sporting
widow thereupon lends her bankrupt brother the
money for the spire, three weddings are satis-
factorily arranged, and the curtain drops to the
worm-eaten old tag—“lf our friends in front are
satisfied.” This farcical coinedy has cost more to
stage than some Shakespearian plays, and Mr.
Hedley Churchward has painted two excellent
scenes for it. Outside of its slanginess, its chief
fault is that the last act is the weakest. It is
admirably played, and next week we shall have
space to say something of the performers.
* MU « *
Up to date “Macbeth’’ has drawn more
money to the treasury at Her Majesty’s than it
has surrounded previously during a similar
period. Why, it is difficult to say, fpr
“Macbeth” is indifferently staged and badly
played. Miss Achurch’s performance is not a
house-filling one. It may bo (though even that is
doubtful) the best impersonation among the lead-
ing parts, but might be cheerfully accorded that
distinction and yet fall far short of greatness.
Mr. Rignold has adopted some extraordinary
readings. For instance, in the scene prior to
the murder of Duncan, when, screwing his courage
to the sticking-place, he says ;
If it were done when ’tis done, then ’twere well.
It were done quickly if the assassination could trammel
up the consequence, &c.
In this he has followed the example of Irving (an
admirable authority on matters of stage uphol-
stery), but, if this be any index to his mental
power, highly qualified for the seat among Britain’s
hereditary “ softies ” which may one day be his.
It is scarcely necessary to say that the full-stop
should be placed after “quiclcly,” and not after
“well,” for the writer’s meaning clearly is : If the
murder of Duncan will end this suspense, then the
sooner I kill him the better. The sentence begin-
ning “ If the assassination ” is but an amplification
of the subject. It would afford many persons
much relief if Mr. Charles Charrington would
assume some character that gets killed off early in
the evening. The duel is about the worst known
in Sydney stage-annals, and Macduff would appro-
priately answer his antagonist’s last, taunt with;
“Lay on, Macbeth, and damned be he who first
gets scant o’ breath.” Mr. Clint has painted two
or three admirable scenes, of which the finest is
the great hall in Macbeth’s castle.

Nellie Stewart has recovered her voice and
is again dividing honours and tights with Marian
Burton, who also pleads indisposition. Despite the
“ owl-like gravity ” with which a usually-fourteen-
days-late critic asserts that the public are highly
satisfied with “Boccaccio” as played at Sydney
Royal, empty seats tell a different tale, and
“ Chilperic ” would have been staged ere this had
it been ready. Last week we spoke of Bessie
“Major” when we should have said “Royal.” The
blunder is excusable, the Royal Bess should be
named Elizabeth. By the way, Woodfield’s
Prince of Palermo is a very creditable piece of
acting, and Marian Burton—who may shortly star
in a different Australian sphere—-has refused to
renew her engagement, which terminates on 27th
inst.

company with those three clever acrobats, the

is making rapid strides in her profession, now
introduces a very clever skirt-dance. “In a
Fog,” much better played than formerly, is the
opening item, and “ M‘Go wan the Millionaire,”
a howling assault and battery in one act by Dan
Tracey, rings the curtain down.

“Famine,” produced at Melbourne Royal
last Saturday, is a dramatic Irish stew which lies
heavily on the chest. The leading character is a
square-set, funny man of evil proclivities, whose
leading features are a suit of battered broadcloth
and a solemn tendency to talk more than seems
good for him. He excites neither admiration nor
scorn but is merely a negative kind of person,
calculated to shine brightest at a funeral. Mr.
Hubert O’Grady, the author of “Famine,” and
monopolist of all its “ fat,” is, truthfully speaking,
a disappointment in both capacities, and the
reason for importing him from America was still
shrouded in mystery when the curtain fell upon
the first Australian' performance of what is pre-
sumably his greatest work. Although his drama
doesn’t run on the oldest Irish lines and is com-
paratively free from “begorra,” the dialogue and
construction offer no evidences of a Boucioaultian
talent, while the actor can scarcely avoid
hasty and unfavourable comparison with the
more rollicking Riggs. A tame, second-
hand hero of no interest whatever pops
up in the course of “Famine,” likewise a
heavy landlord villain goes round oppressing the
finest pisantry in the wurrld ; also, a fine, fleshy
lady, who dies of hunger in the prologue, re-
appears as her own daughter for the rest of the
evening—but they are all like so much dust and
ashes for dramatic purposes. Save for the tran-
sient gleam of an emaciated kid (apparently
starved up for the purpose) and the occasional
introduction of a loaf of bread and horses, two of
which stand unmoved between the shafts of
“ Black Maria ” during a reckless discharge of fire-
arms—but for these flashes of realism “ Famine ”
would be a slow narcotic. However, as Manager
Williamson evidently thought he saw money in
O’Grady and his plays, it were unwise to differ
violently from such an experienced general at this
early stage of the proceedings. Sufficient to
observe that “ Famine ” does not promise to fill a
long-felt want in these parts.
* * * *•
The Alexandra revival of “The Union
Jack ”is altogether a more promising affair than
the original performance at the Royal some 12
months ago. In the first instance the ardour of
Pettitt and Grundy’s play was damped by a
poker-backed midshipman upon whom the story
of his sister’s shame fell with the crushing weight
of a feather, whereas the present exponent of the
afflicted tar reels and totters under his family
calamity, and tears after the betrayer with a
baneful light in his salt-sea eye. Sundry
detachments of British array, too, seem to
thirst for gore more freely than they did,
and a quantity of other incidents have
been improved by travel round the country.
Certainly the show moves faster, and with the
Bland Holts, Maggie Knight, Walter Howe,
Baker, a couple of Normans, and other competent
people to push it along, the joyful tumult of
Saturday night is likely to be repeated until
further notice. The betrayed lady, indeed, is not
a very entertaining damsel in distress, but the
scenery, particularly a snow-bound toll-gate, looks
nice, as usual.
** * *
The rush to enthuse over “Dorothy,” at
Melbourne Princess’s, was almost pathetic, and the
simple earnestness with which swallow-tailed
hordes of the bank-clerk pei-suasion hung over the
back of the dress-circle and enjoyed a vacuous gloat
was enough to make the man of massive intellect
retire into the dim background and kick himself.
Obviously there is a growing demand for “ some-
thing light” in Melbourne—quite apart from the
gas failure—and though the article happens to be
stale and comparatively broken-up, it makes no
difference. From the comedy point of view (this
being a Comedy before aught else, as witness
Elton’s overpowering importance) “Dorothy”
has steadily deteriorated since Leonora Bra-
ham, Aggie Kelton, Woodfield and Federici
figured as the first Australian quartette of lovers.
The present performance is especially weak by
comparison. A return of Fanny Liddiard’s bad
leg, or something, necessitated that fine figure of
an angel handing over her part to Ida Osborne,
who doesn’t fill it except in the higher register.
Charles Ryley, the new baritone, is only a mode-
rate success at the most; and if he has played
Sherwood round the English provinces the assump-
tion is that the provinces have been paralysed.
For the rest, they are the firm’s old company in
its recent off-colour condition, Howard Vernon
alone showing any improvement in voice, while
Elton loses much of his old effect for want of a more
satisfactory Privett than Mrs. Bryer. Chorus
an d orc^es l ;ra are sufficiently near best form, and
Dorothy” is apparently sure of big business so
long as it runs on legs.

** School,” thus far, has beaten the record
at the new Bijou. A learned critic, whose
acquaintance with the modern London stage is
supposed to be founded on hearsay, has discovered
that Pattie Browne isn’t Mrs. Bancroft. But as
the original Naomi Tighe was kicking up her heels
in burlesque along with Danvers and other dead
mends of the past, 16 years before Pattie burst
upon this breathing world the damsel is advised to
wait patiently for the sweet bye and bye, when she
will meet the memory of Airs. B. at even weights.
At present she looks the character of Naomi far
too well, and it is rather a matter for surprise
that she doesn’t ruminate over the probability of
her dear “ Jack ” Titheradge being a trifle matured
for the billet. That great national institution
scores his Poyntz with skill, however, and Beau
Farintosh becomes a more crumbling ruin every
night. Meantime Krux has toned down his
hump, and the sweet girl graduates shy_ their
geographies at his head with greater precision of
aim than they did at first. They are a prime lot
of tartlets, and Krux s admission that he would
“ like to bite Bella ” is characteristic of his mean
soul. A better man would want to bite the whole
lot at once.

Widow O’Brien, at the Opera House, has

The first four nights of “Macbeth” at

a theatre !) averaged £25 better houses than either
“Julius Caesar” or “Alidsummer Night’s Dream,”
although in the latter case Handsome George had
a Boxing-Night to assist matters
Theauthorof “Hero
and Leander,” according
to the theatrical twaddler
of a Melbourne weekly,
is none other than bob
Sutton (R. Standish
Sievier), the ex-book-
maker who very properly
plugged Lord Beerthirst’s
nose. Doubtless the pub-
lisher of this astounding
yarn has been cruelly got
at. The Bulletin has
always understood that
an English journalist
furnished the slight
literary framework of
‘ ‘ Heroand Leander, ” and
that classical Bellew
devised the spectacular
effects. Anyway, we once
had the misery of in-
specting some alleged
poetry by Sutton and
have no hesitation in say-
ing that he couldn’t write
well enough for even the
Milo Bennett column in
Sydney E. News.
* * *
When Mrs. Cora
Urquhart Brown-Potter
saw the statement about
Sievier in print, she in-
stantly laid down her
French novel and wrote
hurriedly to all the
papers that Sutton did not
write the play. In her
“own good time” she
would say who did. But
there was some reason for
the critic’s assumption
that the “delightfullove-
story” came from a
bookie’s pen—or pencil.
Firstly, Leander, in the
last act, is undoubtedly
“in the swim secondly,
H ero, who has gone
crooked, “ plunges” reck-
lessly ; thirdly, in the
apotheosis, everyone’s “ stiff;” fourthly, nearly
every name in the play ends in “ ’os. ” Everything
points, as The Bulletin hinted last week, to
Bellew as the author. The play was “ written
especially for Mrs. Brown-Potter” —and just as
much “especially for Mr. Kyrle Bellew ; ’ while
the opportunities for flopping together “mid
nodings on” could only have been invented by an
interested party. Some years ago, in London,
Bellew was photographed very “ see-more,’’and the
girls raved that he “ looked just like a young
Greek god.” Perhaps that started him on the
play—if he did write it. Anyway, Sutton couldn’t
make a book of such a kind for the young Helles-
punter.
&* * *
Mrs. Gown-Trotter and Kyrle Bellew were
recalled ten times after their final performance at
Melbourne Princess’. Buttonholes, sprays and
bouquets fell like rain. One infatuated damsel,
with a shock head and a hectic flush, ran round
from the centre of the circle to the end and hurled
a long streak of gigantic lilies at Bellew, when
taking a call after the third act.

Annis Montagu, Mrs. Vanderveer Green
and Charles Turner, accompanied by Conductor

does not promise great things—to be successful
nowadays, novelties are wanted.

The reason the Centennial Hall was scarcely
half full at the charity concert last Thursday,
when Santley reappeared after nine months’ ab-
sence, was doubtless the utter want of novelty in
the programme. There was not one fresh artiste,
and only one new song. The fact that a number of
tickets which were sold did not come in was not
flattering to the performers, who are said to have
given their services. It showed that it is not a
wise thing to mix up art with charity-mongering,
and that, to induce people to plank down their
coin at the doors, something more enticing than a
hash of old programmes must be offered them.
Everybody knows that it was only the engage-
ment of Marian Burton which secured the success
of Santley’s second Melbourne season last year.

The Victorian orchestra, with the excep-
tion of the third concert, when the tenor Stockwell
sang, did bad business in Adelaide ; and an extra
concert was given for the benefit of Messrs. Poole
and Otton, the speculators. Yet, Adelaide con-
siders itself a musical city, and the first concert-
hall ever built in Australia was White’s Rooms.

Playgoers in Adelaide are beginning to
realise that Toole is an “ acquired taste,” and that
his one-sided grin, which reminds one of the open-
ing of a door whose top hinge is gone, is not worth
coming miles to see. Nevertheless, the houses
have been good so far because it is fashionable to
laugh at the man who tickled the ribs of the Royal
family and shared with J. L. Sullivan the smiles
of Tummy. But the coarse persons who care not
a twopenny tram-ticket for fashion and royalty
have turned up the old gentleman for Hugo’s
Minstrels.

Theatrical amateurs rolled up in their
hundreds and thousands to Melbourne Royal last
Friday night when Miss Eugenie Duggan gave
vent to her youthful aspirations in the character of
Juliet. It was mentioned, probably as a sad
illustration of feminine perversity, that Miss
Duggan had been studying her part for three long,
weary years under the care of Mrs. G. B. W.
Lewis. In common with most of Mrs. Lewis’s
pupils, the new Juliet is handicapped with an
amount of early self-confidence which denotes the
entire lack of that nervous temperament and
struggling inspiration necessary to ultimate success
on the stage. Under any circumstances, Miss
Duggan could never hope to play Juliet to a
crowded house o'tener than once in her life.
She possesses a pert, happy, low-comedy face,
and a figure not built for romantic heroines.
Her efforts to talk like Essie Jenyns serve
only to remind one that Essie exchanged Nature
for Mary Anderson and lost by the trans-
action ; and, take her altogether, her Juliet was a
further addition to the long list of inflictions

which Melbourne sassiety has suffered, with every
outward sign of satisfaction, at the hands of the
Duggan family. The writer once heard a Miss
Duggan comeforward and spout something concern-
ing her cheeild, at a Juvenile Exhibition. If that
particular offender was the Eugenie of Friday
night, then she must be beyond all question a
hopeless case. Twenty newspapers were favoured
with two tickets apiece for this interesting per-
formance, and if the debutante got twenty encou-
raging notices in return, she is still earnestly
exhorted to understand that they make no differ-
ence whatsoever.

My Father-in-Law.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Mr. Bolingsby—or, ns he prefers to be
called. John Newton Bolingsby, Esq., M.P., J.P.
—is a very wealthy man. This fact gratifies me.
1 do not rejoice merely because it is pleasant to
find a gentleman possessing so many good, social
qualities in a position of affluence ; i have a more
personal and, some may say, a more selfish reason
for gladness—l. am nearly connected with the
gentleman in question.
Mr. Bolingsby owns the biggest store in the
flourishing town of Bungaloo, N.S.W. Ho is the
member for the district, too, and, before his elec-
tion to that position, was Mayor of Bungaloo.
Some ribald wits used to hint that lie might fairly
1)0 called the Mayor and Corporation. This, if a
vulgar allusion to the graceful rotundity of his
Worship’s waist, I pass by with silent contempt;
but if it be intended to imply that Mr. Bolingsby’s
influence over the aldermen was so. great that the
Mayor virtually combined all the municipal func-
tions in his own. person, I admit there was some
truth in the remark, and regard it as a well-
deserved compliment to my esteemed father-in-
law. Eor that is the relation which Mr. Bolingsby
bears to me.
It is no small tiling, I can assure you, to be son-
in-law to such an important personage ; and it is
gratifying to reflect, too, that this greatness
which 1 have attained was not born with me, neither
'was it thrust on mo-I achieved it. And I will
tell you how.
•Two years ago I little dreamt of the dis-
tinguished career which lay be ore me. At that
time my occupation, though honourable, was not
a pleasant nor, indeed, a lucrative one. It was my
business then to prepare and serve nutriment for
•‘52 very objectionable persons who were engaged in
removing the outer garments, so to speak, of
3(1,000 sheep at a station called Jigala. Not to
put too fine a point on it, I was shearers,’ cook.
The duties were onerous, and I regret to say that
gratitude, or even a judicious appreciation of my
efforts as chef de cuisine, was totally lacking on
the part of my clients. Their appetites, too, were
profound as the bottomless pit. They required
four solid meals a day, and four “ smoke-ho’s ”
between times. I was never able to detect any
difference between a “ smoke-oh ” and a meal, ex-
cept that the men ate rather more at a “ smoke-
ho,” and were also more hilarious. At meal-times
they usually contented themselves with calling
me offensive names, such as “Doctor” and
“Slushy,” and swearing in a loud tone of
voice at my puftaloonas. But at“smoke-ho”
they frequently heaved large portions of my care-
fully-made cake at my head with unpleasing
accuracy and violence, and one ruffian once poured
a bucket of tea at a high temperature down the
back of ray neck, because, lie said, it was not tea
at all, but sanguinary rotgut.
So, by degrees, I acquired a distaste for
my occupation. And when the shed was “cut
•nit” I found that the amount 1 got from
those men of capacious stowage was just about
£9 less than I owed to the storekeeper for
rations. This confirmed a belief I had held
for some time —that I was not altogether a success
as a shearers’-cook, and I have never since engaged
in that profession. Some men may succeed at it,
but I cannot. I hear that my successor at Jigala
is doing well this year. But then he biffed the
“ringer ” on the point of the jaw with his right on
the very first occasion upon which that person
ventured to make a derogatory remark about the
buns ; and when they went outside he polished the
said “ ringer” off in two and a-half rounds. Tact
is a great thing in managing large bodies of men.
There was one bright side to my life at Jigala—
Julia Bolingsby was there. I adored Julia from
the very first. Jigala was owned by a brother of
Mr. J. N. Bolingsby, and Julia was there on a
visit to her uncle. I saw her every day—at a dis-
tance, of course, for it was not to be expected that
Tommy the cook would be on the list of her inti-
mate friends. She often visited the shed, though,
where those beasts of shearers worked. I don’t
know what she could see in them to interest her.
My opinion of shearers tallies exactly with that of
a squatter to whom I once applied for work. I
wont up timidly and said :
“ Do you want any shearers, sir?”
He looked at me with a baleful glare, and said :
“ Shearers be damned ! I’ve got 19 of the brutes
up there already !”
But I digress. On one cver-to-be-remembered
day, Julia, in her search for novelty, visited my
kitchen. I was busy at the time taking a
kangaroo-pup out of a pot of soup into which lie
had inadvertently fallen. I dragged the canine
out by the tail, and as (after allowing him to cool
somewhat) I ran my forefinger along his body to
return to the pot the liquid adhering to him
he howled dismally. So I did not hear Miss
Bolingsby approach, and she was in the kitchen
before I was aware. Old Clubson, the super.,
was with her; and in his usual brutal manner,
made some offensive remarks, under the guise of
wit, at my expense. But, in spite of the extremely
unfavourable circumstances and surroundings, I
flattered myself that I had succeeded in creating
an impression on Miss Bolingsby’s tender heart,
and that consoled me.
* # #
But when I was living at Bungaloo, after
wards, earning a precarious subsistence by acting ,
as local correspondent forthe metropolitan W’keki. V
iiiMiASH, and going round with posters for stray
dramatic companies, my penchant for Julia very
soon brought me into collision with her pa. That
gentleman, in his most urbane manner, told me
gently, but firmly, that if ever he caught me ad-
dressing his daughter again, he would “ absquatu-
late” me. He would also give me in charge, he
said, and sit on the Bench when my case came on.
Therefore I left Bungaloo, and went out west,
droving. Subsequently I spent a short time as a
whaler on the Murrumbidgce. Then I joined the
unemployed in Sydney, and, while there, was per-
suaded by an old mate to accept the position of
cook on board the ketch Mud-turtle, b nmd for
the north-west coast of Tasmania. That, was the
worst experience 1 ever had. Sailors 1 found to
be oven more brutally coarse than shearers. And
I was sea-sick, too. So, when we got to Tasmania,
I deserted, and ‘ lay low” till the Mud-turtle filled
up with potatoes and sailed away.
I got a post then as shopman in a general
store, owned by an old villain who bad been
“lagged ” about 40 years before, and was proud of
it. Ho never wearied of telling the tale of his
expatriation, and this was probably because of the
infinite variety he infused into the narrative. The
circumstances varied with each recital, and his
offence was described by him with much circum-
stantial detail as poaching, burglary, highway
robbery, wilful murder, and several other mild
dissipations. His constant recapitulation of the
adventures of himself and his “pal’’became very
wearisome to me, and I endeavoured to alleviate
my sufferings by relating some highly fictitious
yarns about my own experiences.
While in the midst of a very fantastically un-
truthful story one day, I brought in the name of
“an old chum of mine, splendid fellow—Jack
Bolingsby, Ins name was.”
Old Hawkins, my employer, had been paying
only feeble attention to me up to this ; but as he
heard the name, lie brightened up visibly, and
chipped in :
“ Jack Bolingsby ! You know Jack ?”
“ Well, yes, rather ! Why, me an’ Jack—”
“ Not J. N. Bolingsby? Tall an’ stout, an’a
big wart on his left cheek ?”
Now, Mr. B. has just such a facial adornment,
and I admitted the fact.
" Do you know him?” I asked, languidly.
“ Know him, is it ! Why, damme, Jack
Bolingsby an’ me was sent out for the one job! ”
* * *
Judicious pumping had the effect of getting
the fullest particulars from Mr. Hawkins. He
showed an inconvenient amount of interest in Mr.
Bolingsby’s whereabouts, though, and said he
would look him up, because old Jack and he used
to be pals, and he was sure Jack would be glad to
see him again.
►So 1 said [ didn’t know where Mr. B. was then;
in fact, I hadn’t met him for years. I had heard
a rumour that he was dead, indeed. Been thrown
off a horse one night when he was drunk, I heard.
“ Well, I wan'd like to see old Jack again,’’said
Mr. Hawkins. “But I s’pose it’s no use trying to
find him now. Seven years since you saw him,
you say, Wilkinson ? Well, well, it’s a great pity,
for old Jack would be pleased to see me, I know !”
* # *
Three weeks later I turned up again at
Bungaloo. There was a parliamentary election

HE: “I AM GETTING £7 A WEEK FROM THE GAS CO. AND AM NOW IN A
POSITION TO ASK YOU TO BE MY WIFE.”
pending, and Mr. Bolingsby was one of the candr
dates. On the evening of my arrival he was enter
taining the public with free drinks at the principal
pub., and had a select party of friends with him
in the back parlour. He was “ holding forth ”
with his usual eloquence, and telling his friends
all about his ancestral halls in England, and of the
bully times he used to have there when he was a
boy. How his father (the Squire, you know) used
to keep a pack of hounds, and a “retinoo” of
flunkies, and eleven or eight carriages, and so
forth.
I came in then, and the great man (he had to be
affable at election time) nodded condescendingly
and proceeded. When lie had just concluded a
thrilling story, in which he and a duke’s daughter
were the principal characters, I remarked :
“By the bye, I met an old retainer of your
father’s family, the other day, Mr. Bolingsby.
His name is Hawkins. He was describing your
folks’ place in England to me, just like you’ve
been doing to-night. Fine old fellow he is, but he
got into trouble after he left the Squire’s service,
he says. Was transported for burglary and served
al5 years’ sentence. But he seems to take a
delight in talking about the old place and old
Squ're Bolingsby, as he calls him. Do you re-
member the man ?”
Mr. Bolingsby looked very hard at me, but I
never flinched.
“B’leeve I do, Wilkinson,” he said, “now you
call him to my mind. Come up to my place to-
night and we’ll have a talk about him. 1 might
be able to do the old follow a good turn. Have
another whisky, gentlemen ! Well, here’s luck !
Coming, Wilkinson ?”
I came.
Our interview was a long one. But, after
having fairly frightened Mr. Bolingsby by my
startlingly accurate knowledge of a big bank-
burglary that took place in London about 40
years back, the names of the offenders, their
sentences and their subsequent careers, I managed
to re-assure him by convincing him that it was not
at all necessary that anyone else should be so well
informed, and we parted on most affectionate
terms.

Under the auspices of John N. Bolingsby, Esq.,
M.P., I have flourished like the green bay tree.

Tact is a fine thing.
A.O.
A little natural dissatisfaction has been
caused by the conduct of an Irishman living near
Dublin, who killed his mother and ate part other.
This unpleasantness between him and the old
lady has also aroused unfavourable comment in
the newspapers, and it is felt that something ought
to be done in the matter.
Smith Fish, member for Dunedin (N.Z.),
considered that he had been-wrongly reported in a
late issue of the Otago Times, so he rose to order
and _ called the correspondent ot that paper a
sublime ass, an Ananias, a Gehazi, a greasy ass, a
hypocrite, a wrecker of newspapers, and several
other unclean objects. He was speaking in a dis-
passionate vein when he said these tilings, and
was buried in a profound Fish calm, but if he had
given way to indignation it is probable that he
might have thrown up his judicial attitude and
fallen into abusive language. Happily he re-
strained himself.
There is a feeling of profound contentment
in the air when a pawnbroker is taken in, or a
Chinaman is gone over by a tram-car, or when a
man named Moses lends money on the personal
security of a fellow-creature who can’t be found
afterwards. In a once-prosperous New Zealand
town, now given over to dust and decay, almost
all the moveable property in the place is in the
keeping of an individual known as Aarons, and
his back room is choke-full of goods of all descrip-
tions. lie left the window open the other day,
and a sinner, whose ultimate fate is calculated to
arouse a shudder, came along with some friends,
and, by means of a rod and line, extracted a pair
of pants, and pawned them over again in the front
shop. Then they fished out some boots, and traded
them over Mr. Aarons’ counter. The third bite
consisted of an overcoat and a lot of socks, and
the gladsome Hebrew made a small advance on
them, and felt that business was looking»up : and
after this the .party gained confidence, and for
three solid hours they extracted property by a
system of Chinese cheap burglary, and sold it back
again to the confiding son of Judah. It was not
t ill they attempted to pledge the same pants for
the fourth time that the chosen person dropped to
the outrage, and fled with a heartrending wail into
the b.ck room to investigate. He was just in
time to see a large quantity of underclothing take
its lightsome, erratic flight through the casement;
and when he rushed back to the front shop he saw
two excited feet speeding round a distant corner—
only that, and nothing more. Then he raised his
voice in a great anathema and lamentation, and,
sitting down on a flat-iron of which the ticket had
been lost, he called on the God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob to annihilate the offenders unless de-
tained by previous engagements, and remarked
sorrowfully that ho would have to go home to his
wife and children mit noddings, and that he was
a miserable pankrupt, and had kone proke.

The Case of Mrs. Moeller.
GREAT EXCITEMENT IN SYDNEY.
In these days of talking dolls, telegraphs, ocean
cables, telephones, microphones and other electric
inventions, when the occurrences in one part of
the world are telegraphed to the farthest point
therefrom in one day, and when a traveller makes
a journey right round the globe in 63 days it
takes something out of the common to startle a
community, but the late experiences of Mrs
Laure Mceller are enough to startle the dead'
Mrs. Moeller, who resides at Newtown, N.S.W.’
is a native of Germany and came to this country
some years ago. She has suffered from Liver and
Kidney complaints for years, and about three
months previous to the present time was com-
pletely prostrated and unable to work ; dropsy of
the ankles and lower limbs having set in. We
diagnosed the case ourselves and can truthfully
assert that it was a case of advanced dropsy due
to relaxation and enfeebleraent of the membranes
of the Liver and Kidneys, which permitted the
waste fluids to exude through them into the
muscular tissue. We advised the use of Clements
Tonic and it was taken for some weeks and has
resulted in a complete cure. Mrs. Moeller herself
thus describes her case Stanley Laundry
Georgma-street, Newtown, N.S.W. I can with
confidence bear witness to the wonderful efficacy
of Clements Tonic in curing Liver and Kidney
disease. I have long been a victim to indigestion
(caused by liver complaint) and an affection of the
kidneys. I suffered terribly from headaches,
pains in the back and side, with obstinate con-
stipation. No one except myself knows what my
sufferings have been. I was always tired and
languid, with no ability or inclination to perforin
my daily work. My tongue was furred in a
morning, and a sour taste in the mouth, and
frequent vomiting; one day I would be pretty
well and the next very distressed or completely
prostrated with a very confirmed languor. This
went on until I was so ill I was completely done
up and quite unable to move. My ankles being
swollen as thick as my thighs, I consulted
physicians all of whom pronounced the case one of
Dropsy, they variously ascribed the cause to be
heart, liver or Bright’s disease. The kidneys-were
undoubtedly diseased, because the swollen ankles
when pressed with the finger would leave a dent
in the place for days, and it was easy to press the
end of the finger an inch deep, when the hole
would not fill up for four days. I had heard of
the wonderful cures effected by Clements Tonic
and commenced its use. I took three bottles and
the swelling in the ankles commenced gradually
to subside, I continued the medicine and am now
completely cured ; my ankles are their usual size,
1 have no aches nor pains and can do a good day’s
work with pleasure, my tired, aching feelings have
all disappeared, and I am confident I have been
rescued from an untimely grave by the wonderful
virtues of Clements Tonic. My address is at the
head of this letter, and I will reply to any- com-
munications if a stamped envelope is' sent with
inquiry, as I consider it my duty to publish a
record of my wonderful cure. Yours very grate-
fully, Laure Mueller.
Mrs. Moeller’s ease is only a prototype of many
others in this country. She obtained a cure by
persistent treatment, and this is the only way
chronic disease can be cured, a half-hearted treat-
ment is never satisfactory, you must continue the
remedy for a considerable time if you want to cure
long standing cases, the tendency after a certain
age is always towards decay, therefore if debility
has been eating its way into the system for month's
or years, it is very unreasonable to expect one or
two bottles to restore perfect health, all bad cases
require protracted treatment.

Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria recently

Little Mr. Frencham, now claiming to be
the discoverer of Bendigo goldfield, took the lead
in an agitation against Government impositions at
Bendigo Creek, three years before Peter Lalor
hoisted his flag at Eureka. Melbourne Daily
News of the period reported how Freneham wound
up a furious harangue by asserting that Britons
never, never would be slaves. He was a warm-
blooded democrat of 35 then. Now, in his 75th
year, the ex-digger is a highly prim, respectable,
and “loyal”-looking individual.
The sentences passed by a minor Austra-
lian judge, now happily retired, used to vary with
the weather, and so on. He was a martyr to
rheumatics, etc., and whem the damp and blood-
acids got into his knee or his ankle or his shoulder,
or whatever brains he had, Heaven help the
prisoner found guilty. Looking blandly over his
spectacles, in an apparently merry mood, he would
crack a joke, hope that the prisoner, upon whom he
intended to have compassion, “would reform at
the end of the short sentence he was compelled to
pronounce, which was —oh ! phew ! (twinge)—
ten years’ (spasms of agony) penal servitude.
Oh ! dear! call the next case! (My God, this is
dreadful!)” And how many such Gy, dodder-
ing wrecks are even now on the IG udi !
POLITICAL
POINTS
The S.A. public debt is £19,395,000. Out
of this, £14,000,000 returns interest to the extent
of 3£ per cent.
Times are changing. The Riot Act was
twice read before the military charged the people
at Southampton
The Barrier miners threaten to nominate
their president (Mr. Cann) for Parliament next
election on the pure Labour ticket.
Melbourne Age has disgusted the Trades
Unionists by first encouraging them to fight for
the cause to the bitter end, and thereafter advising
them to do the other thing.
During the first half-year’s existence of
the notorious. Hornsby (N.S.W.) railway-line it
earned £BBO only’. Working expenses and interest
for the same period totalled £0849.
A measure is before S.A. Assembly, pro-
viding for seamen, etc., being allowed to vote
through the post. The signature of the voter
must be witnessed by the postmaster.
Sir George Grey advocates the securing
and working by the Government of all N.Z. coal-
mines. This should and will be a plank in the
programme of the Australian labour-party.
The French Royalists wallow in riches,
and could well afford to provide Boulanger with
his magnificent landau and the actress of the
Francaia whose name was coupled with his.
“ Havhm studied the question,” says Mrs.
Belva Lockwood, “Lam convinced there is
nothing in the Constitution of the United States
to prevent a woman becoming its President.”
A well-known Melbourne merchant, at a
recent fizz-meeting function, thus proposed a
toast: “The Ministry and Parliament, dam ’em,
I don’t believe in ’em, but let’s drink reformation
to them. I wish they’d let up for three ye.r, and
close Parliament for that time.
An enthusiastic correspondent of a Mel-
bourne paper wants the special-constable force to
be made permanent, as a kind of National Guard.
But the National Guard “turned dog” on the
aristocracy in the French Revolution. They fired
low the wrong way—into the proud stomachs.
Garvan’s rejection from the Federal Con-
vention was not, as has been asserted by certain
members, “due to his religion.” All the same,
the Roman Catholics in the N.S.W. Assembly
have set a bad example : they not long since gave
an absolutely block vote for a certain Public
Works candidate
VV °, • , , I
There is one ground, and one ground
alone, upon which ex-lreasurer Garvan is to be
sympathised with in his deposition from the pqsi-
tion of a partially-elected Federal Convention
delegate. It is this : ex-Treasurer Burns, who
generalled the movement for Garvan’s rejection,
chiefly based his action on the fact that Garvan
was an avowed Republican.
Grant Allen, when requested by an Eng-
lish editor to write an article on “Fair Wages,”
replied that he had no idea what tho term “ fair
wages” implies. “Wages,” said he, “may be
sufficient or insufficient, high or low in kind or
coin, squalid or substantial, but cannot possibly
be ‘fair,’ for wage earning implies a hap hazard
world, divided into a small body of land-owners
and capitalists on the one hand and a large body
of expropriated wage-earners on tho other.”
A nice, clean, kind-hearted “ Property-
holder ” writes to Sydney Daily Telegraph,
pointing out that the “ Only thing nowto preserve
law and order and to teach the_ working classes
their proper position is to deprive them of the
legal privilege they ought never to have had
extended to them, and enforce, by a system of
military discipline, the order which alone can pre-
serve society.”
Says the Twentieth Century :
From the point of view of wealth-production by in-
dividual capitalists the labourer’s food is simply a lubri-
cant, mere axle-grease—at most fuel for the human engine.
In the hands of the merchant, food is capital only in so
far as he expects to derive profit from its sale. The
labourer himself is no capitalist, though in possession of
food enough to last him the week, the month out. He
does not expect to increase his income by eating his
meals.
The Chinamen have commenced to rush
Canada in thousands, and the people of the snowy
land sent an urgent deputation to Premier
M‘Donald to demand immediate legislation. The
reply o‘ that old, prize groveller was, that the
Mongol must be allowed to come because loyalty
and the “ interests of the Empire ’’ demanded it.
“ Any hostile action,” wailed this memorable
sycophant, “would be calculated to embarrass the
Imperial Government, and, therefore, it was
desirable that Canada should cultivate the friend-
ship of China.” The Dominion is the most servile
of all colonies, but we should fancy that there are
stormy times in view for Canadian loyalty, and
that a rude awakening is preparing for “ Old
To-morrow. ”
Those Names.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The shearers sat in the firelight hearty and hale
and strong
After the day’s hard shearing, passing the joke
along.
The “ ringer ” that shore a hundred as they never
were shorn before,
And the novice who, toiling bravely, had “ tommy-
hawked ” half a score ;
The“tarboy,” the cook, and the “slushy,” the
“ sweepy ” that swept the board,
The “picker-up” and the “ penner,” with tire rest
of the shearers’ horde.
There were men from the inland stations where
the skies like a furnace glow,
And men from the Snowy River, the land of the
frozen snow.
There were swarthy Queensland drovers who
reckoned all land by miles,
And farmers’ sons from the Murray where many a
vineyard smiles.
They started telling stories when weary of cards
and games,
And to give the stories a flavour, they threw in
some local names.
And a man from bleak Monaro, up on the table-
land,
He fixed his eyes on the ceiling and started to play
his hand.
He told them of Adgintoothbong where the pine-
clad mountains freeze
And the weight of the snow in summer breaks
branches off the trees.
And, as he warmed to the business, he let them
have it strong—
“ Nimitybelle, Cunargo, Wheeo, Bongongolong -
He lingered over them fondly because they re-
called to mind
A thought of the old bush homestead and the girl
that he left behind.
Then the shearers all sat silent, till a man in the
corner rose;
fsaid he: “I’ve travelled a plenty, but I never
heard names like those.
Out in the Western district, out on the Castle-
reagh,
The names are nice and easy, short for a man to
say;
You ve heard of Hungry bam bone, and theGunda-
bluey Pine,
Quobbotha, Girilambone, and Terramungamine,
Quarabone, Eunonyhareenha, Wee Waa, and
Buntijo ”
But here the shearers stopped him, “ For Heaven’s
sake go slow :
If you reckon such words are short ’uns out where
those names prevail
Just try and think of some long ’uns before you
begin your tale.”
And the man from the Western district, though
never a word he said,
He winked with his dexter eyelid, and then he
retired to bed.

Dear Bulletin, —You may or may not
have heard of the fatal propensity of upstart suc-
cess to change its name, as from Smith, for
instance, to Symthje, or, mayhap, to Carington.
Has Trenwith, M.L.A. for Richmond (Vic.), been
afflicted by the gods in the same way? I
remember, years agone, reporting for the Mel-
bourne Age some public political meeting held in
the Hotham Town Hall, at which gathering a
rising young bootmaker, with a Cornish-sounding
name, distinguished himself. None of the ‘ reps. "
were sure of the spelling of that orator’s name, so
I “axed himself,” and he gave me the letters,
“ T-r-e-n-o-w-e tli Tren o-weth.” Now, the
young bootmaker is an older and better-off man,
and a member of Parliament, and calls himself
“Trenwith,” which is, 1 understand, a more
aristocratic family name among “Cousin Jacks.”
Either the bootmaker of yore spelt his name
wrongly to me, or the cognomen has been changed
to suit the Membah. I may as well be in the
fashion, so I beg to sign myself—Yours finically,
The Dvi’l’somani.u'ke.

The members of the notorious Soudan
Contingent are going to erect a memorial tablet to
the late Mr. Dailey in St. Andrew’s (Anglican)
Cathedral, Sydney. So far as we know, Mr.
Dailey was not an Anglican ; we therefore pre-
sume the raison d'etre of the memorial to be that
his most memorable deed was typically Anglican.
The Bulletin rejoices in so open a local confes-
sion that nigger-murder is the secret of England’s
greatness.

It would appear as if, after all, the ex-
Reverend Mr. Gardiner had thrown over the
young lady whom he “does not blame” as the
cause of all his sorrow. Hear what he says in his
“admission” to the Presbytery: “And now I
feel, having passed through this terrible experience,
having seen my sin and suffered for it and turned
from it ,” &c., &c., &c.

We are once more told that Lord Carington
lias spent £6OOO a year over and above his
Governor’s salary, while he has been in N.S.W.
And this is cited by aristocratic insolvents as a
reason for refusing the going-a-begging Governor-
ship. The inferential condition that an Australian
Governor is not appreciated who does not vulgarly
display his wealth and ostentatiously spill around
his money is a cutting sarcasm on the modes and
manners of Pott’s Point, Toorak and Co.

How seldom is a generous action appre-
ciated at its true value ! Sir R H
was travelling from Sydney to Brisbane the
other day, and they brought him a cold turkey
and trimmings to break the monotony of the
journey. He and his aide lined themselves
until they were tired, and then, just before
retiring for a smoke, Sir R H
requested the sleeping-car guard to go forth and
fetch one of the cadet-boys—of whom there was a
big bunch aboard —and tell him to explore the
ruins of the vice-regal banquet. The happy boy
received his glad tidings with a snort. “ I’m not
going to eat his leavings; tell him to eat them
himself and be blowed.”

Lord St. Leonards, it transpires, has parted
with his last remnant of landed estate, and pos-
sesses no place to lay his aching head in the dear
old mother country. It further transpires that
Hingland has quite lost the run of its hopeful
hereditary legislator, who is supposed to be scin-
tillating round the back-blocks of Australia, seek-
ing what he can devour. This indifference to the
laws of his country—which continue to be made,
amended, or revoked without his assistance—.
strikes us as reprehensible in St. Leonards, seeing
that Providence, in its boundless goodness and
mercy, caused him to be born for senatorial pur-
poses. The Bulletin therefore calls upon Lord
St. Leonards, wherever he may be, to hurry off to
the land of his birth, and support the British
Constitution for all he is worth, however little
that may be. This is presuming that the noble
Peer has not, in the meantime, settled down to
some useful career in Australia. It would please
us to hear that St. Leonards is doing well in the
interior, because a squatter-peer is badly wanted
to give our bucolic aristocracy more tone. Seri-
ously, though, this somewhat battered nobleman
is credited with a talent for something better than
the little freaks which have got him into so much
trouble. We have heard him described as one of
the smartest ready-reckoners this side of the line;
so, unless he happens to be making a pile out
here, we again implore him to return, like the
Prodigal, to the House of Lords—a place where
hereditary intellect is always at an alarming pre-
mium.

The two best signatures in the N.S.W.
Supreme Court are those of Judges Owen and
Innes, both of whom write beautiful hands and
scrawl so much alike that either could sign the
other’s cheque and get it cashed without the
slightest difficulty. Foster’s autograph is weak
and tottering, and looks like an unsuccessful flash
of lightning dipped in ink. Windeyer’s consists
of a dot, a splash, a blot, and a gallows, and
finishes up with a flourish that resembles nothing
so much as an execution where the rope has broken
and deposited the unhung defendant on the pave-
ment. Chief Justice Darley signs himself in a
flowing hand that breaks to pieces in unexpected
places, and Judge Docker dabs his name down in
a firm, resolute way which seems to imply that
the writer cares not one individual curse for any-
thing or anybody. The most execrable signature
ever perpetrated within the walls of the Supreme
Court was that of ex-Judge Deffel, and his writing
in general presented a close resemblance to a
series of squashed flies. On one occasion he handed
down a written judgment ordering an insolvent to
be committed on a charge of fraudulent bank-
ruptcy, but, by an unfortunate mistake, it was
entered up as an order for the immediate granting
of his certificate without further examination.
This complication was never cleared up, and the
gaol-door yawned in vain for at least one financial
sinner. N.B. —This brief anecdote is unquestion-
ably original. We invented it ourselves.

It is noticeable that the girl whose form
divine most resembles a yard of pump-water is
the first to discard those artful contrivances which
have hitherto given the eye of her best feller
something to dwell upon. The-average maiden,
for the nonce, is a melancholy strip of hard
realism, almost destitute of undulation or curve.
Her hips have disappeared no man knows whither,
and another old feature of the surrounding dis-
trict is just now sought in vain. The place where
her warm, beating heart was once supposed to be
has sunk to a low level, whilst her vanished
shoulders are represented by two miserable pin-
nacles of merino, or similar dress stuff, charged
with gun-cotton. Her soft, silken hair is fuddled
up into a lump shaped like a periwinkle shell (as
though she had tumbled out of bed in a hurry for
the purpose of lighting the fire), and a-top of this
hirsute enigma she balances a hat which seems to
have dropped there by accident, nine tenths of
the alleged head-gear being, as often as not, pro-
jected into space. There are times when lovely
woman becomes less sane than usual, and one
of those periodical occasions is making sad the
heart of man as we go to press.

It is a fact of which there is irrefutable
evidence that many Sydney employers have
ordered their clerks to choose between enrolling as

The legal brotherhood of New Zealand
have a promising job on hand in disputing the
will and settling the estate of an affluent lady who
died at Rangiora. She wore six or eight pa rs of
stockings on top of each other, and went round in
her deceased husband’s boots, and the' rest .of her
attire consisted of potato-sacks. She generally
cut two holes in the end of the sack and pushed
her extremities through them ; and the summit of
the bag was hauled up about her ears and tied to
her hair with a rope. Her language was stronger
than that of the average of her sex, and there is
good material for a row in the Probate Court when
the relatives wake up to the situation.

A bazaar for a charitable and religious
purpose is in process of organisation at Bendigo
(Vic.), and the ladies of that golden city held a
meeting lately to arrange details. The first
business proposed was the summary deposition of
the chair-female and the elevation of another
lovely woman to her place, but the adherents of
the lady in possession went out into the passage
and stamped and shuffled their delicate feet to
such an extent that the speakers could only jump
about in inaudible frenzy and shake their fists at
each other’s heads. Then a vote was taken, and
the losing party called the winning party a cat
and reflected on the fit of its bonnet, and
announced that its hair wasn’t its own ; and the
victorious faction insinuated that the other one
bought its complexion by the pound and that it
was in rags until it married its present husband.
Also each body declared that, the other one
couldn’t be trusted witli the money, and hinted
that it had embezzled the funds on previous
occasions, and finally the gathering commenced
to cruise round in a disorganised sort of way and
whoop at everybody it met. One or two male
supporters who were ptesent judiciously tore the
meeting apart when it seemed on the verge of
violence, and by dint of backing the most
vociferous of the committee out into the street
actual collision was averted, and after two hours
the ladies dispersed, threatening to expose each
other to the police.

among London policemen was one Beevers, a
native Australian and ardent admirer of The
Bulletin. It was he who taught a higher
morality to the foorce, and encouraged them to
agitate for a salary to support life decently with-
out resort to the old device of “cleaning out”
intoxicated citizens who fall by the way. Beevers,
described as a clever organiser, impressed upon his
comrades the fact that a silver watch, honestly
purchased, is better than a gold repeater picked
up promiscuous-like during the small hours of the
silent night. This was just about the real mean-
ing of the “bobbies’ ” demand for higher wages.
Beevers suffered the fate o£ most great reformers
by “ getting the sack,” and at latest dates the
foorce was secretly raising a subscription for that
“ dangerous ” young hero.

Admiral Crapaud and the officers of the
French Fleet were entertained at a banquet by the
Mayor of Pianketank, U.S. L’Admiral officiated
at the soup, and his first gulp with the ladle
fished up a frog. “ Sacre ! Vat is dis?” The
Mayor : “ Oh, we thought you liked ’em. There’s

Melbourne paper: “The strike beggars
both sides.” Which side first, eh? What one
side calls beggary is to have its daughters reduced
from the dress-circle to the stalls, and itself re-
duced from an eighteenpenny cigar to a shilling
one. It will even ladle callipash and callipee out
of a silver soup-tureen witli a gold-lined bowl, and
call it beggary, though it be raillionairy compared
to what the parson calls his beggarly pittance cf
five hundred a yaw.

There is much joy amongst the S.A. vic-
tims of the book-fiend. Dr. Morrison has lost hia
action against a purchaser of the “ Aldine History
of South Australia,” and consequently the other
purchasers will be able to back-out of their £6.
By the decision of the Court the history-man
drops several thousands, and hia brilliant volumes
remain on his hands. As for the book-agents, all
they can show for twelve months’ trouble is a
broken nose, torn trousers, and general bad
language.

Coal, raised to the pit-mouth at a cost of
Is. Bd. per ton, is retailed in London at 225. per
ton. The miner receives on an average 16s. 7d.
weekly, and he and the consumer are defrauded
in order that “ noble ” lords who draw hundreds of
thousands, in one case a million yearly, as royalty,
may gamble away tens and twenties of thousands
in a single night.
People have no idea of the fatal speed 'of
express trains. It is a common thing to see their
buffers bespattered with blood after a long and
quick run. The noise of their approach disturbs
the small birds, and, as they fly across the line,
along comes the thunderer at a speed of which
they have no conception, and dashes them' to
pieces. Of course, we do not refer to Australian
express trains.
A Lower George-street (Sydney) shop-
keeper points out that most of his trade is done
with sailors and others who do their shopping
after seven in the evening, and therefore he cannot
afford to comply with the demand of the Shop
Employes’ Union for early closing. He might
compromise the matter by opening later in the
day. If his business is all done at night why open
till then ?
The autobiography of Mr. John Calvert,
who calls himself “Lord Baltimore,” reads like a
chapter from the history of the “Pirate Kings.”
The old gentleman, now 80, claims to have found
gold in N.S.W. 60 years ago, though people at
the time wouldn’t believe him. Visiting New
Zealand, he came upon gold there also ; after
which he returned to N.S.W. and found gold in
the North, also tin, diamonds and copper. Then
he discovered the great Burra copper-mine, one
of the richest in the world. By-and-by he found
an enormously rich mine in West Australia, and,
taking samples without letting his crew into
his confidence, he, after visiting New Guinea,
etc., headed his yacht for Maoriland, to emhark
a quantity of rich stone. The yacht was wrecked
in New Caledonian waters and its valuable cargo
lost. When he got back to England he found
capitalists incredulous and made a heavy wager
with them that he would return from Australia
within three years with a ton of gold—
which he did, landing at Liverpool with
£96,000 worth in 1853. Mr, Calvert, who scorns
the claims of Hargreaves, says he sold N.S.W.
gold in Sydney in 1845 to a jeweller named Cohen.
He further says he is going to be one of the richest
men in the world and will shortly be worth a
million a year. He alleges that one of his
ancestors originally found Australia in 1490, that
he has in London a museum worth £30,000, and
that he owns the earth’s boss gold-mine, which is
located in W.A.
THE CAUSE OF PEACE.
H E Y entered slow a private room,
The man and tender child ;
Their brows were overcast with gloom,
The boy, indeed, looked wild.
The sire’s hand held an object grim,
By erring youth abhorred —
Of straight tree-twigs, a bundle, slim,
Bound at one end with cord.
He sate him down upon a couch
And drew the urchin close,
Who, ’neath impending doom did crouch
Of sharp posternal woes.
Yet, as his vesture, disarranged,
Of dreadful crisis told,
Nerved by despair, his aspect changed,
And “Father,” cried he “ hold !”
“ Stay, stay your hand, and muse awhile
Australia’s sad estate;
Distraction, loss, and conflict vile,
Strike not! Let’s Arbitrate ! ”

The clever illustrator of Stanley’s book,
Joseph Bell, has a terrible down on liars, and
took a mischievous delight in endeavouring to
land Stanley on the horns of some dilemma. For
exam'ple, he got him to describe the method of
getting a donkey across a deep river. Stanley
explained to him how the porter led the donkey
into the stream, holding the bridle and keeping
the donkey’s head (which was alone visible) out of
the water, with one hand, and swimming
vigorously with the other hand. “Yes,” said
Bell; “did the porter carry a rifle?” “Of
course,” said Stanley. “Yes,” says Bell, “and
in which hand did he carry the rifle, seeing that
one hand is already engaged in guiding and help-
ing the donkey, and the other in swimming for
dear life?”
Rev. Hagenauer, a Presbyterian mis-
sionary to the Victorian and S. A. aborigines,
declares that he knows a Gippsland black gin who
reads and understands Macaulay, and says she
thinks Warren Hastings his best essay. “The
first difficulty the missionaries have to encounter,”
says Mr. Hagenauer, “is to teach them the right
of private property. They are by nature simply
communists, having no idea that anything can be
claimed by a man as his own, but that all have an
equal right to it. This is most difficult to eradi-
cate; but until it is done little good can be effected,”
The Bulletin recommends the parson to say no
more on the subject, as he is just on the verge of
proving that the blackfellow knows more about the
philosophy of human happiness than his teacher.
Doctors Tidy and Macnamara, who stand
very high in the medical world, have published a
pampldet on the Maybriek trial, in which they
say that they decided to allow popular feeling die
out ere stating their views. As toxicologists, they
arrive at the following conclusions :
1. That the symptoms from which Maybriek suffered
are consistent with any form of acute dyspepsia, but that
they absolutely point away from, rather than towards,
arsenic as the cause of such dyspeptic condition.
2. That the post-mortem appearances are indicative of
inflammation, but that they emphatically point away from
arsenic as the cause of death.
3. That the analysis fails to find more than one-
twentieth part of a fatal dose of arsenic, and that the
quantity so found is perfectly consistent with its medicinal
ingestion.
An educated Indian’s letter to his English
master :
Honoured Sir,—Last evening while peregrinating
throughout city, I am hearing from friend who was like-
wise enjoying evening zephyrs, that vacancy took place
to-day in your Highnesses office by death of Balm. . . .
Poor man, I am greatly sorrowful for his demise, he has
left gigantic family who will teed their mouths the devil
knows. Your Honour will see from my ludicrous and
weak-hearted tone of voice that I am well-meaning, hard-
working, extra energetic. Devil-me-care sort requiring
abundant fields for display of copious brain power
hitherto limited by blaggard school master. For my
qualifications please note, I am damnably well up in
precise writing, draughting, Docking, and office rotine
work, and in private life I am much addicted to swearing
English oaths, drinking dam lots of pegs and other rami-
fications too numerous to detail. I am no orthodox be-
lieving all rotten superstitions of ancient forefathers, but
I am Iconoclast destroying idols and such like to great
detriment of hippocrites and dam scoundrels. It is with
fervance that I solicit your majesty’s hand and heart in
moving this my petition to your own favourable condition
and my wife’s heartfelt gratitude, who will all fall upon
my bended knees and pray long and continuously for
your mighty honor and honours gracious lady, and all
your posthumous children to follow up.
One of the saddest excrescences on the
legal system of N.S.W. is the official designated a
“Commissioner of the Supreme Court for taking
Affidavits within the Colony” under the “hand
and seal ” and seal of the Chief Justice. In the
country districts this elevated person may be a
pound - keeper, or a cattle - inspector, or a
constable; but still the unfortunate citizen
who requires to deposit his testimony with
the Supreme Court has to travel all manner of dis-
tances to swear in his presence, and pay the
statutory fee, in addition to his own expenses, for
the privilege’of doing so. In the matter of swear-
ing, the nearest squatter who holds the dignity of
J.P. is generally a proficient, but though he is
sufficient for all ordinary testifying purposes, in
this particular instance, he is of no account. A
month or two ago a boundary-rider broke his neck
on a station by the distant Lachlan and left
behind him an insurance policy for £lOO as his
only asset. His widow travelled 85 miles in
a dray to fill in the necessary papers and
swear, that she was herself and was duly entitled
to 'the money; and then she returned home by
the same conveyance. About a fortnight later it
transpired that another immense blue form had
to be filled in and sworn to, and accordingly the
bereaved female performed the journey over again
in a spring-cart and swore afresh. She got home
once more—and died ; and her son and heir started
forth on horseback to fix up this new complication
and swear some more. Very wisely, he did not
return. He settled down in the township in order
that he might be at hand to keep on swearing
until the business was fudy put through. A
“Commissioner ” &c., may be a valuable officer,
but he is scarce and hard to find in the back-
blocks, and it is cheaper to settle down in his
vicinity and take him regularly than to travel oyer
half a continent at short intervals in search of him.
Faithful to the Last.
THE TOUCHING STORY OF A GAS-METER.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
The Happy Bridegroom had brought his
Blushing Bride home to his pretty new cottage in
a Melbourne suburb. “I have had the gas laid
on,” he whispered softly in her ivory ear, “and
here is the Gas-Meter. ” He pointed to a box in
the front verandah. That evening the spiders
that lived in the corner of the verandah, and the
cockroaches that came there to hold periodical
corroborrees asked each other what the strange
object was.
“ I am a poor but honest Gas-Meter,” replied a
voice from the box.
# # *
Next night the listening spiders and cock-
roaches heard two voices conversing in the box.
One sounded like the wind through a keyhole—
that was the voice of the Gas ; the other was hard,
uncompromising, and metallic —that was the
Meter.
“The stokers have gone out,” said the Gas.
“I’m sorry,” replied the Meter, “but I shall
work all the harder and make things even. lam
poor but honest.”
And the spiders and cockroaches heard it grind-
ing along steadily all through the night.
# * *
“Your breakfast is late this morning,
dearest,” said the Young Wife; “ there wasn’t gas
enough to boil the kettle.” '
“Never mind, darling,” replied the Loving
Husband, “ there will be less to pay for at the end
of the month.”
But the Meter overheard them and. murmuring.
“I’ll look after that,” put on an extra spurt and
got in two hours of overtime that day.
# # *
Next night the spiders and cockroaches
heard the voices again. The voice of the Gas sighed
HIS WISH.
PAT: “OI WISH OI WAS AS DHRUNK AS OI AM NOW WHEN OI AM
SOBER AGIN IN THE BUSH.”
feebly, as if it were dying. It said—“ The
Secretary of the Gas Company, and all the Clerks,
have struck, and Pm going to strike.”
“Sorry to hear it,” answered the Meter, but 1
still remain. Whatever else fails them the Com-
pany can rely upon me. I’m poor, but honest. And
it commenced to work night and day from that
time forth.
# * *
At the end of the month the gas-inspector
came around and looked at the meter. ‘ Double
the average consumption,” he muttered. “These
young couples are very extravagant, but this beats
anything I’ve seen. Still, the apparatus can’t lie.”
“I’m poor but honest,” murmured the Gas-
Meter.
“ We’ll shut up the house, and go away from
here to some other country till the strike is
settled,” said the husband to his wife that morn-
ing, as he read the bill left by the gas-inspector.
* * *
Years after, an old man with grey hair
and a long, white beard opened the rotting gate
of the cottage and sat down in the ruined veran-
dah. This was he who had brought his blushing
bride to the cottage when it was new. He heard
voices coming from the box in the corner.
“ Why don’t you have sense,” said one, a gusty,
intermittent voice, “and give up working for
nothing? You’re very old now and you want
rest. Besides, the Eight Hours’ principle has been
extended to all automatic machines of late years.”
“I know nothing about that,” replied a feeble,
cracked voice. “I’m here to register, and I’ll do
my duty till I perish. The Company can rely
upon me. I’m a poor but honest gas-meter.”
“But,” said the other voice, “you crass old
idiot, haven’t I told you that the Gas Company
was dissolved ever so long ago, and the Electric
Lighting and Cooking Company established in its
place? There is no gas any more; so what’s the
use of your grinding away registering the con-
sumption of what doesn’t exist ?”
“Then what are you ?” queried the Meter.
“I’m Wind in the Pipo—that’s all; and there
hasn’t been anything but mein them, except water
now and then and a few earwigs, for years past,”
answered the other voice.
‘ ‘ I’m getting very old, and perhaps I don t
understand these things; but I know my duty,”
said the Meter. “ The Company may have faded,
as you say, but that’s no reason why / should fail.
I’m but a poor, honest Gas-Meter, and I’ll keep on
registering till I rust to pieces.”
“Faithful to the last,” sighed the old man.
“ Neither you nor I belong to this age, old Meter.
’Tis time we both were gone. ” ...
A few days later his body was found in the
Yarra, with the Meter tied round his neck. He
looked very calm and peaceful. The Meter was
still registering.
CREEVE ROE.
Every trade in New Zealand has formed a
union except the grave-diggers. There are always
so many new openings, you see, in their profession.
A man who had at night cut a hole
through a tent and then, inserting his head and
arm, stolen several articles of value, was indicted
for burglary before a Yankee judge (Kemp). The
plea was that as he had never entered the tent
with the whole of his body he had not technically
committed burglary, and must be discharged.
Judge Kemp told the jury that if they weren’t
satisfied that the whole man was involved in the
crime they might return a verdict against the
guilty portions of him, whereupon the jury con-
victed the right arm, right shoulder and the head
of the prisoner, which portions were sentenced to
imprisonment with hard labour in the State
prison for five, years. “ As for the rest of your
anatomy, prisoner,” said the judge, “you can do
with that what you darned well like.” This is
sent to The Bulletin as a very smart story. We
now move to quash the conviction on the
ground that the sentence is bad, inasmuch as the
right arm and shoulder and head alone cannot
perform hard labour within the meaning of any
decent code of gaol regulations.
Wanganui (N.Z.), a forgotten little city
that sleeps among interminable sand-hills, got up a
race-meeting last month, and the principal gentle-
man amateur distinguished himself in various un-
expected ways. As he was an extensive advertiser,
however, he was let down easy by the press ; but
when he rushed into the editor’s office next day
with thunder in his eye, and a crumpled paper ui
his hand, a terrible fear suddenly arose that he
hadn’t been let down easy enough. “ Look here,”
he hollered as he executed an impromptu pas seul
all over the room ; “ this dashed reporter of yours
says I lost my reins in that infernal steeplechase.
What’s the meaning of it ? Who’s responsible for
this miserable outrage? Who did it ? I’m going
for the fellow, whoever he is ! ” The editor
assumed an attitude of shocked surprise. “Dear
me, you don’t mean to say that such a groundless
assertion ” “ Oh, dash the assertion ! What
I want to know is, who did it? ” “I assure you,
my dear sir, that the unprincipled liar who
perpetrated that ” “Oh, blow the unprincipled
liar! You passed the thing, sir. You're responsible.
You say there that I lost my reins, and yet you
were on the ground yourself, and if you weren’t
blind you might have seen that I let the animal
bolt with me at the start. I lost my hat, too,
only you were afraid to say it. I lost my head
into the bargain ! Didn’t you see that, you—you
—you dashed Ananias ? I lost ray saddle and my
stirrups, and burst ray collar, and came in hanging
on by my spurs and the horse’s mane, and all the
crowd hooted, and somebody threw a hunk of mud
at me, and when I fell off at the last jump I saw
y OU _vou, sir—just falling to pieces with laughter.
I was drunk —hopelessly drunk —if you want to
know what was the matter’, and you saw it all,
and there’s no dashed excuse for your conduct in
not publishing a correct account of the proceed-
ings. Don’t let this sort of thing happen again,
please. Come out and I’ll shout. \ ou’re not fit
to be trusted with a newspaper.” And the editor
W ent out and was shouted for like a man drinking
in a dream.
Verse We Have Read.
I Made Another Garden.
I made another garden, yea,
For my new love :
I left the dead rose where it lay
And set the new above.
Why did the summer not begin ?
Why did my heart not haste ?
My old love came and walked therein,
And laid the garden waste.
She entered with her weary smile,
Just as of old ;
She looked around a little while,
And shivered at the cold.
Her passing touch was death to all,
Her passing look a blight;
She made the white rose-petals fall,
And turned the red rose white.
Her pale robe, clinging to the grass,
Seemed like a snake
That bit the grass and ground, alas !
And a sad trail did make.
She went up slowly to the gate ;
And there, just as of yore,
She turned back at the last to wait,
And say farewell once more.
ARTHUR O'SHAUGHNESSY.
A Voice From Afar.
Weep not for me ;
Be blithe as wont, nor tinge with gloom
The stream of love that circles home,
Light hearts and free !
Joy in the gifts Heaven’s bounty lends ;
Nor miss my face, dear friends !
I still am near; —
Watching the smiles I prized on earth,
Your converse mild, your blameless mirth ;
Now too I hear
Of whisper'd sounds the tale complete,
Low prayers, and musings sweet.
A sea before
The throne is spread ; its pure, still glass
Pictures all earth-scenes as they pass.
We on its shore,
Share, in the bosom of our rest,
God’s knowledge, and are blest.
JOHN HENRY NEWMAN.
The Wage-Slave.
In forest, field, and mine we toil;
Our labour never ends ;
Our sweat-drops fall upon their soil—
The land our Father sends.
Our necks are keyed into their yoke ;
They’ve mowed our forests down,
They’ve swept our valleys desolate,
They’ve ravaged field and town.
God’s wrath upon your downy beds,
Ye spoilers of our store ;
God’s malison upon your heads,
Ye scourgers of the poor !

The British working-classes seem a rebel-

work and recognition of their union.
“ If a man says he doesn’t drink, that’s a

pavement on his hands, knees and ears, leg-roping

limbs of the tree up which he is hauling himself,
that is an objective fact, and needs no analysis ;

Her Love-Letter.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Carry my message, cool, plashing waves f
Waft it, oh, stormy wind that raves
Over the cliffs to the white-topped seas;
Whisper it low, sweet evening breeze.
Tell him that trustfulness crowns my way
Though my path be thorny from day to day.
Tell him remembrance hath made me strong
To wait and to suffer though years be long.
Will he list to your missive, oh, cold green seas ?
Wind laden with odours from vine-clad leas ?
In the clouds, the seawraek, the misty spray
Will he fashion a face that is far away ?
Or when ocean is calm and the moon at e’en
Hath passed o’er its bosom a silver sheen,
Will he longingly look o’er the radiant track
Where the flying vessel’s wake runs back
And deem it lit-up by eyes love-bright
That wait on his wanderings noon and night ?
Where’er thou art, dear, in the hours that are lone
May thine ear be inclined to Earth’s faintest tone,
To garner this hint from her every breath
That Love is immortal as Time and Death.
I wait, love, your answer at night, at noon,
In the flowers, ’mong the rays of the sun and moon,
And it comes, like an argosy from the South,
When I’m wakened at dawn by your kiss on my
mouth.

George Bowling, an enlightened British
subject, was hanged recently in England, and
under the law which provides that the property of
a condemned assassin is forfeited to the State the
Government duly annexed and collared one iron
bedstead, four glaring oleographs, one pail, one
large iron saucepan, one clock, two stools, a rabbit-
hutch, a watering-can, a screaming, bright-red
illustration of the Redeemer, one long-handled
prong, one short ditto, a ramshackle wooden shed,
four large china plates, two earthenware cups and
saucers, and one china basin. What the Adminis-
tration wanted with this extraordinary aggrega-
tion of furniture is not stated, but it scoffed the
lot according to the statute, and when George’s
relatives, who are in low circumstances, applied
for the things, they were told to clear out.
Impressive statement posted up on a

Which is a humble Chinese way of stating that
the curse of Joss and the anathema of the great
Confucius, together with the accumulated wrath
of the old, nine-headed idol in the temple of
Buddha, will descend on anybody who neglects to

expression about the Mongolian author.
It is related that in 1815 an unpopular
prison-official was caught by a gang of escaping
convicts, bound hand and foot, gagged, carried
into the bush, and fastened down upon an ant-bed.
Long afterwards a skeleton, stripped of every ves-
tige of flesh and clothing, was found tied between
two stumps in the bush not far from the spot
whereon now stands DarlinghurstGaol.

Saturday’s meeting at Caulfield was made
solemn and respectable by the strike of the Royal Society

“ starting price,” or starvation odds “ right out,” while
that nobler animal, the horse, was bringing in the boodle

they will stop away and curse until totalisators are erected
in their stead, so much the better.

The Doncaster St. Leger, true to its traditions,
has again been won by a filly. Memoir is the latest addi-
tion to the long list of Oaks winners that have subse-
quently carried off the big race up North, and it is evident
that the lucky Duke of Portland will be fairly in it at the
end of the season. Memoir was bred by the Book, who
allowed, or rather “ declared,” for her to be eased for the
One Thousand Guineas in favour of her stable companion
Semolina, to the disgust of all good sportsmen. As
neither the Two Thousand nor Derby winners were placed
in the Leger the chances are that Memoir could have
swept the “ classic ” board had she been entered for all
five events, and run right out for each. By the way, it
isn’t so long since the cable liar was telling us to back
Kirkham for this race, in which the horses that donkey-
licked him at Epsom have been proved to be rank duffers.

“Jonah,” a Yankee axeman, in 1802, at Sey-
mour, Vie., for a£s wager, chopped down a redgum tree
Of 6ft. Sin. in diameter in 4h. 50m. The butt, which still
stands (says the local Express), almost as clean as if the
tree had been sawn off, forms a memento of perhaps the
best axeman who ever felled a forest giant in the Aus-
tralian bush.

The first fight of the Australian Athletic Club,
between Jim Fogarty and Charley Dunn, comes off on the
22nd. When the pair met on a previous occasion, Dunn
appeared to be getting a,bit the best of it, when he lost
his caution, and Fogarty fairly broke his jaw with a right-
hander. The muscular development of both men is abnor-
mal, but Fogarty, like Jem Smith, is too round and
chubby to be a man-killer.

The match-committee of South Melbourne Foot-
ball Club have, to their own satisfaction, acquitted the
team of all crookedness in the second match with Carlton.
Numerous resolutions are to he forwarded to the Associa-
tion, and that milk-and-watery combination will unhesitat-
ingly acquit the accused likewise. Various excuses; ottlje
slender order have been advanced to account for tl|e
cronk play of the premiers, but nothing is said'about llje
conferences and subsequent change in the bettingjbefore
the match. ■ j

The public hooting of “ black-leg ” or non-
union labour by a marching detachment of
N.S.W. Volunteer Artillery is one of the most
significant items of the week. When men have to
finally take sides they always shoot in the direc-
tion in which they hoot.
The death of the veteran actuary, Mr.
Morrice A. Black, has involved the promotion of
Mr. Richard TeeCe, F.I. A., from the Secretaryship
to the proud position of General Manager and
Actuary to the Australian Mutual Provident
Society. The experienced and trusted Mr. R. B.
Cameron (who, like Mr. Teece, entered the
society’s service as a junior clerk over 20 years
ago) succeeds to the Secretaryship ; and the chief
clerk of the head-office (Mr. David Carmont,
F.1.A.) has been appointed assistant-actuary and
chief clerk.
How, in effect asks the organ of the
strikers, can the Employers’ Conference logically
affirm the principle of perfect freedom of contract
between individual employers and employes while
taking cognisance, as it does in its fourth resolu-
tion, of the private relations of the marine officers
to any third party or parties? How can it con-
demn the boycott while urging its employment by
I united action against the affiliated marine officers ?
! How can it declare against coercion being used to
j induce labour to join any union while supporting
coercion for the purpose of preventing anyone
joining any union he pleases, or any union affi-
liated with any or all other unions ? How can it
deny the right of all labour unions to affiliate
while urging the affiliation of all employers’
unions?
Editor Bulletin. Sir, —The attention of
the whole of the N.S.W. railway employes is
riveted on the pension proposals of the Commis-
sioners. I have heard but one verdict given on
the matter. It is that the scheme is another dodge
to destroy every vestige of trades-unionism in the
service. Apparently, Chief Commissioner Eddy
has succeeded in spreading throughout the de-
partment a feeling that he wishes every check
removed which prevents him from being
the complete master of the men. They have
seen by his conduct towards all who approach
him except in a frame of abject humility that he
does not scruple to play the high-handed autocrat
where no other course is open to him to attain his
purposes, and now they regard all his measures
with intense suspicion. His latest move is looked
upon as a sugar-coated pill that, when swallowed,
will effectively purge the patient of any desire to
belong to unions; even those who do claim member-
ship of any of those trade-associations connected
with the service, look upon the pill as being a medi-
cinewhoseobjeet is to bringthe employes more com-
pletely under the control of the bo ses than they
are now, thanks to the present despotic Railway
Management Act. When this is the feeling
of all who dare to speak their minds, surely
I Parliament will not allow itself to be deluded by
the assent that may be given by many of
our members—under fear of black-listing—to
the proposed measure, which, if the men
could vote in secret by ballot on the sub-
ject, would be rejected as a snare and a
delusion by an overwhelming majority. I might
say, on another matter, that the few toadies
amongst us who, like the “ Waverley car-
-1 conductor” that writes to the daily papers
i warning our men against throwing in their
I lot with the outside working-classes, cannot be
considered as representing the views of any but the
I most narrow-minded and selfish men in the
! service. I am firmly convinced from my
own observations that 19 out of every 20 men in
I the Department are profoundly in sympathy with
the men on strike, and were it not for the intimi-
dation of a certain bitterly capitalistic daily paper
the Amalgamated Association would have followed
the example of the E.F. and S. Association in affi-
liating with the Trades and Labour Council. Such
affiliation would no more necessitate the porters,
guards, shunters, &c. going out on strike than it
does necessitate the adoption of that course by the
engine-men. It would only facilitate the collection
of levies and subscriptions to support those im-
mediately concerned in a labour crisis. For such
potential aid our men - more particularly our
tramway men —would have the assistance of all
workers against the gangs of boodlers who are
trying to steal the tramways from out of
the control of the State ; whilst we would
have the united voting support in time of
elections of all workers to help us to return mem-
bers pledged to restrain the capitalistic Commis-
sioners from introducing a cut-throat system of
competition into the service. Our interests are
1 indissolubly bound up with the fortunes of outside
workers, and their loss is sure to be our loss —
their gain our gain. Speaking for myself and
many another railway man, I look forward to the
time when there will be no employes of private
individuals in the country ; but, instead, a uni-
versal system of State employment.—Yours, &c.,

The Melbourne Argus thinks that “French
critics are particularly apt to think chiefly by pre-
cedent.” Judging by internal evidence, the recent
strdce-incidents noticed by the Argus have been
edited by a French critic of the ancien regime.
When Bunvood (Sydney) Borough Council
received a recommendation from the N.S.W.
Principal Under-Secretary re the swearing-in of
special constables, one of the aldennen said that
he thought the swearing-in of special constables
was unnecessary and a menace to good order, and
moved, —“ That the letter be consigned to the
wastepaper basket.”
THE BOOKMAKERS’ STRIKE.
Weep, Pity, weep,
Full mourning keep;
Now need our minds the best physicians;
For, oh! —yes, oh ;
A weary woe
Has overlaid the metallicians.
The bookie Jews
Do stout refuse
To pay tax-fees to some racecourses ;
Abe, Mo, and Ike
Have gone on strike—
“ We can’t improve the breed of horses !”
Canst better “ gets”
Without set bets ?
Ah, no ! the problem is a knock-out;
It’s wrong, you know,
For Ike and Mo
To be subjected to a lock-out.
Such evils dwarf
The strikes on wharf,
The boycotting of bread by bakers;
Let Labour fade
For want of aid,
But, please, preserve to us bookmakers.
Meek Christians, vexed,
Heave not a text
At turfy saints with whom you differ ;
If Mo Und Ike
Do go on strike,
Why —’osses can’t be knocked much stiffer.

There it something to in the daily

The ethics of buying and selling appear to be for

to see that he don’t get too much. But what is
too much ? It is almost a profound question, and
presents the strange paradox that the dearest in
many things is olten the cheapest. Certainly this
is so in food, when health is involved, and in
remedies which restore health after it has been
impaired. It is certainly so in clothing; for a
cheap suit that will hardly last one season is
dearer than the one which will last two seasons,
the difference in price being reasonable. So in
shoes and the like. Recurring to the items of
food and health, undoubtedly the most important,
it is found that villainous adulteration is what
renders it cheaper in much that is sold, and men
are known who have spent thousands to be cured
of disease, have suffered years of agony, and have
trifled away their substance on worthless remedies.
That which is testified to by thousands as being
an absolute cure, and permanently efficacious, is
cheap at any price in comparison with such as
have no virtue, and which prolong suffering. A
case in point is the following : “New Bloomfield,
Pa., April 20, 1880. The Charles A. Vogeler Co.,
Baltimore, Md. Gentlemen, —For more than 30
years I had been afflicted with rheumatism so
severe I had to use morphine to secure rest at
night. Spent hundreds of dollars with physicians
and for remedies without benefit. Five years ago
I tried St. Jacobs oil, and it effected an entire
and permanent cure. I have not been troubled
with it since. Cold or damp weather does not
affect me at all. I desire to give it my-unqualitied
endorsement.— J. E. Bonsall, clerk of the several
Courts of Perry County, Pa.” The point here is
not so much what Mr. Bonsall paid for the great
remedy for pain, for the price is a mere bagatelle,
but that he was permanently cured after 30 years’
suffering. Of course the poor must count the cost
in everything; but they should reckon on the
sound basis that that which is bad is worthless,
and that which is the best and will cure, and stay
cured, is cheap at any price.
EXPERTS AND CRYSTALS.
Have you ever examined critically the crystals
used in the bezels of the Waterbury Watches 1 If
not, then this will suggest so doing at yovtr first
opportunity. Each of the glasses used undergoes
a minute and careful scrutiny in the hands of an
expert—an expert whose precision and untiring
fidelity appear almost marvellous. Crystals are
often rejected whoso defects are so slight as to
escape not only the ordinary eye, but even the
vision of foremen and trained employes in other
branches. Yet, upon taking one of them to an
expert, that person will invariably point out the
fault, and do it, withal, so quickly that one would
almost believe the spot to have been marked for
identification. The testing of crystals, rigid as it
is, is but a sample of the method and care pre-
valent in every branch of the Waterbury Watch
Co.’s factory. Precision is the keystone to'heir
success : and therein.lies the secret of the wonder-
ful results obtained in the timekeeping qualities
of their marvellously reliable watches at a nominal
cost. The people of Great Britain and of the
United States are eminently practical, while those
of the Australasian colonies are nowise behind
them in this particular, and the continued flow of
acknowledgments received from them could not
be wrung forth by misrepresentation, nor sus-
tained by anything else than the most deservedly
practical worth.

Quotation from the Melbourne Age :
Capital and Labour must be permanently reconciled if
they are to be of any benefit to each other and to society.
We pause to ask the alleged democratic Age what
it means by “society” outside of “Capital and
Labour?” That and similar indefinite and mixed-
up terms are freely used by almost every com-
mentator on the present strike. We wouldn’t
give Our best girl’s worst hair-pin for that unit
of “ sassiety ” which could nohow be included in
either of the categories, “ Capital ” and “ Labor.”

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literary
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
sistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
ThE Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government,
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived directly from the Land,
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System. -• '
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces— "
j Religious Interference in Politics. 1
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is nbt
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality ‘lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes;
The Bulletin’s conductors-;clhSm that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent, has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for hightclass printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia.
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced*-the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-flre
of national progress : it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege —the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weexiy
journal, is not loaded witfia • weight of matter
transferred from the columWof - a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin ds
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed. vpsv
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
ntelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more them a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official—that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than ally
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

"The Conventional Lies
of our Civilisation.”
THE ECONOMIC LIE.—CHAOOER II.
BY MAX NORDAU.
LET us analyze more closely the separate elements
of the picture we have just been drawing. We
have seen the rich man revelling in superabund-
ance without labour, the factory-hand, day-
labourer, condemned to physical decay, and the
•ntellectual labourer trampled to death in the
deadly competition. Let us turn our light upon the
minority, the wealth-possessing class. What are the
ources of the riches of the men who compose this
minority ? They have either made them for them-
selves, or increased what they received by inherit-
nnoe or else limit their efforts to retaining what
they' have inherited. I will discuss this matter oi
inheritance at length farther on, only remarking
we that man is the only living being who carries
the natural care for his offspring-one of the
manifestations of the instinct for the preservation
of the race—to such an extreme, that he wishes to
remove the necessity of providing for themselves
not only from those of the next generation until
their maturity, but from his remote posterity,
during their entire lives. The increase of in-
herited property usually takes place without the
slightest interference on the part of the owner, and
is certainly not the result of his labour. The
large and ancient fortunes consist mostly of real
estate. The value of the land and of the buildings
rises every year and the income from them in-
creases in proportion to the growth of civilisation.
The products of the manufacturing industries
become cheaper, provisions dearer, and the
dwelling-places in the constantly-increasing cities
more cramped (and expensive Some political
economists 1 deny that provisions are growing
dearer. But they can only bring sophistical argu-
ments to support their assertion. It is true that
in days of more restricted commercial intercourse,
famine and starvation were more frequent, and a
failure of crops in certain places was succeeded by
such an extortionate price for the cereals as would
be to-day inconceivable. The rapidity and extent
of the variations in the cost of provisions in t le
past has ceased, but the average price of meat and
farm produce is constantly rising, and this rise is
onlv retarded not prevented, by the short-sighted
policy of skinning the enormous tracts of virgin
soil in America and Australia. The day is not
far distant when the piratical cultivation of the
soil in the new continents must come to an end ;
the plough will find no more unclaimed lands to
conquer. Then the cost of provisions will rise
bevond measure, while the continual improvements
made in machinery, and the constantly-increasing
utilisation of the forces of nature now and
vet to be discovered will cause the price
of all manufactured goods to fall in propor-
tion. This two-fold current in the_ economic
world, the'upward tendency of the prices of pro-
visions and the downward tendency of the prices
of manufactured products, continues to increase
the wealth of the land-owner and the poverty of
the factory-employe. The latter is obliged to pro-
duce a constantly-increasing number of manu-
factured goods to exchange for the agricultural
products necessary to sustain life:; the former
receives in return for his farm produce a con-
stantly-increasing number of manufactured article.
The factory-employe finds it more and more diffi-
cult to satisfy his wants, the land-owner is able to
eniov more and more of the results of the former s
labour. The number of lyroletaires grows daily
larger, toiling for the land-owner who is thus
practically their lord and master. _ The wealth of
the inheritor of land and houses is not increased
by his own efforts, but by the faulty organisation
of the conditions of land-ownership according to
the present economy of society. According to
these conditions, the land, the natural working-
tool of mankind, is placed m the hands of a few,
and as a consequence, the lowest classes, robbed
of their share of the soil, are obliged to crowd into
the great cities.
# * *
New fortunes are accumulated by trade, specu-
lation, or manufactures. _ We will pass by the
extremely rare cases in which a man with the co-
operation of chance attains to great wealth by
discovering some gold and diamond mine or petro-
leum springs and is able to retain and work them
for his exclusive benefit. At the same time,
thanks to the existing ideas of property owner-
ship these exceptional cases have a certain theo-
retical value as confutations of another so-called
scientific axiom of the doctrines of political
economy—viz., that capital is, in all cases, accu-
mulated labour. What labour does a diamond of
the size of the Koh-i-Noor represent, which some
adventurer may find on the ground in South Africa
and sell for a million ? The economist is ready
with his answer ; the gem is certainly the result of
labour—that is, of the labour performed by the
finder in stooping and picking it up. ihe estab-
lished science accepts this explanation with a
satisfied acquiescence and proclaims the theory to
be saved. A sound human intellect, however,
refuses to accept the would-be science, which is
invented by blockheads, with the purpose of
ornamenting and excusing in empty, flowery terms
the injustice of the present system of political
economy.*
* * *
Legitimate trade, that is, the equitable exchange
of- the raw materials and the finished products
between the producer and the consumer by means
of a third person, the trader, who makes a profit
on the goods he handles, giving them to the last
buyer at a larger or smaller increase in the selling
price over the cost, in these days rarely leads to
the accumulation of great wealth. There are too
many people who are satisfied if they have the
wherewithal to support life, or can lay by a
moderate amount, and the competition for the
custom of the consumer is too great for a tradt s-
man to amass an especially large fortune except in
isolated instances. The general tendency of the
wholesale and retail trade is to suppress all un-
necessary middlemen, to place the consumer in as
direct intercourse with the producer as possible,
and to reduce the profits of the middle men to
an amount only sufficient to cover their necessary
expenses of handling the goods, and supply them
with the necessaries of life. The merchants’
profits can, of course, become much greater, even
extortionate, if he is able to limit or suppress free
competition. If any one can convey saleable goods
under difficult conditions or dangers, to Central
Africa, or among the wild tribes of’ Asia, he can
sell them at a very great profit, because the number
of those who are ready to venture life and health
for the sake of possible wealth, is comparatively
small, and he has, for a while, a free field of
operations. But the undisturbed possession of
such a profitable trade does not last very long, as
the dangers and difficulties decrease in proportion
as the country becomes better known, and the
opening of other countries, formerly inaccessible
to foreign trade, brings them under the laws which
govern general competition. In 20 or 30 years
this source of great wealth would be sealed up.
Central Africa, Asia, and China will be reached
as easily and safely as any European or American
country ; the merchants will be obliged to pay as
dearly there and sell to consumers as cheaply as is
possible without actual loss. The trade in Congo
ivory and Chinese cotton will then realise profits
no more abundant than those we are accustomed
to at home.
* * *
Enormous profits can also be made by a single
dealer, or close combination of dealers, if they are
able to control some indispensable article, to
monopolise its sale, so that the purchaser can only
receive it from their hands. He must resign him-
self to the alternative of doing without it, or
paying the price charged for it by the robber band.
But this proceeding does not come within the
limits of legitimate trade ; it is an act of violence
which the laws of certain countries (France, for
instance) regard and punish as a crime. It brings,
us to the second source of enormous fortunes,
speculation.
* * *
Speculation is one of the most intolerable and
revolting manifestations of disease in the economic
organism. Those profound sages who maintain
that everything that exists is superexcellent, have
also attempted to defend speculation, to justify
it, to assert its necessity even to enthusiasm. I
will immediately prove to these panegyrists what
the principle is whose cause they are espousing.
The speculator plays in the economic world
the role of a parasite. He produces nothing, he
does not even perform the questionable service, of
mediator, performed by the merchant. He con-
fines himself to taking away from the real workers,
by stealth or violence, the largest part of the pro-
ceeds of their labour. The speculator is a robber
who robs the producers of the articles produced
by forcing them to accept inadequate compensa-
tion for their toil, and the consumers, by forcing
them to buy from him at an enormous advance.
The weapon with which he falls upon producers
and consumers like a highwayman, is double-
barrelled, and is called elevation and depression of
prices, or cornering the markets. He makes use
of this murderous implement in the following
manner. When his intention is to plunder the
producer, he begins to sell certain goods that he
does not possess, at a price lower than the current
market-rates, promising to deliver them to the
purchasers a fortnight, a month, or three months
later than the date of sale. The purchaser, of
course, buys of the speculator because he asks
lower prices. The producer now has only two
courses open to him. If he is rich enough to carry
his goods without selling until the day arrives
when the speculator is obliged to deliver those he
has guaranteed to the purchaser, then the specu-
lator will not be able to get the goods at as low
prices as he had hoped, and will be obliged to buy
them at the producer’s price and lose money upon
them, thus being-robbed instead of robbing. But if
the producer cannot do this—and this is by far
the most frequent cam—then he is forced to sell
his goods immediately at such prices as the goods
will bring in the market. He must under-bid the
speculator, who then becomes his purchaser, for
the consumer has already ordered what he wants
from the speculator. Thus, when the time comes
for him to deliver the goods, he is able to buy
them of the producer at a lower price even than
the one contracted for.
# * *
The producer may have become bankrupt by
the operation, but the speculator has got his pound
of flesh, and is happy. If his aim is to plunder the
consumer, then he buys up all the available goods
offered of a certain kind at the producer’s price.
He can do this without trouble, as the transaction
does not cost him a single penny ; he pays for his
purchase, not in cash, but in promises. He need
not settle his account for weeks or months, as the
case may be. Thus, without real possession, fre-
quently without going to the expense of a single
dollar,'the speculator becomes owner of the goods,
and if the consumer wishes to buy any of them he
must apply to the speculator and pay the price
he demands. The speculator receives into one
hand the money given him by the consumer,
and, after abstracting a portion as large as
possible, which he puts into his own pocket, he
hands over the remainder with the other hand to
the producer. In this way the speculator, without
labour, without benefiting the community, be-
comes wealthy and influential. Capital extends
to him the highest favour, unlimited credit.
When some poor fellow of a working-man wants
to start in business for himself, he meets with the
utmost difficulty in borrowing the small sum he
requires to purchase his tools and raw material,
and to support himself until the sale of his first
productions. But when some idler with sufficient
audacity decides to live upon the labour of others
and wants to carry on some speculative buying
and selling on a large scale, both.producers and
consumers place themselves at his disposal without
waiting even to be entreated. They say that they
run no risks ; the credit demanded only exists in
theory. The producer does not give up his goods;
he only promises to deliver them on a certain
day at a certain price, of course only upon the
receipt of cash. The consumer, on the other
hand, does not pay down the purchase price; but
only agrees to pay it on the day that the goods are
delivered to him. This theoretical credit is suffi-
cient, however, for the speculator to create for
himself, out of nothing, the most scandalous
wealth.
# * *
Every working-man, every one without excep-
tion, is tributary to the speculator. All our
wants are foreseen, all the necessary articles of
our consumption are bought up beforehand by
speculators, on credit, and sold to us as dear as
possible, for cash. We cannot eat a bit of bread,
nor lay down to rest beneath our roof, nor invest
our savings in stocks, without paying to the
speculators in breadstutfs, in land and buildings
and Stock Exchanges, their assessments. The
taxes which we pay to the State are oppressive,
but by no means so oppressive as those exacted
from us by speculation. Certain persons have
ventured to defend the Stock and Grain Exchanges
as necessary and useful institutions. It is a
miracle that they were not suffocated by the
enormity of their assertions. What, the Exchanges
of the world useful and necessary ? Have they
ever kept within the limits of their legitimate
business? Are they ev c r simply the meeting-
place of the bona fide purchaser and the bona fide
seller, where honest demand and honest supply can
come together and transact their business? The
simile comparing the Commercial Exchange to a
poison-tree is incomplete, because it only sym-
bolises one phase of the transactions carried on
tliere —their effect upon the moral nature of the
people. The Exchange is a den of robbers in
which the modern successors of the robber knights
of the Middle. Ages make their abode and cut the
throats of all who pass that way. Like the robber
knights, they form a kind of aristocracy, which
gets a handsome livelihood out of the people.
Like the robber knights, they claim the right to
exact contributions from the merchants and
artisans. But, more fortunate than the robber
knights, they run no risk of being hung high and
dry, if a stronger than they comes upon them, in
their high-handed course of purse-slashing.

We sometimes console ourselves with the reflec-
tion that speculators in times of panic are sure to
lose at one stroke all that they have been accumu-
lating in the years of unchecked robbery. But
this is a pleasing delusion with which the pastor’s
lambs try to comfort themselves, who like to see
punishment follow crime as the finis. Even if a
panic does force a speculator to disgorge his ill-
gotten gains, it cannot alter the fact that for
many years perhaps he has been living in the lap
of luxury, at the expense of the labouring
members of the community. He may lose
his property at such a time, but no
power on earth can deprive, him of the
champagne which has been flowing in streams for
him, nor of the tiniftles he has eaten, the piles of
gold he has gambled away on the green cloth, nor
of the hours he has spent in all kinds of pleasures
only possible to the rich. Besides, a panic is only
disastrous to single, isolated speculators, not do
speculation in general. On the contrary, panics
are the great harvest of speculation, the oppor-
tunities for the slaughter of the entire saving and
producing classes in a nation or in a continent, en
masse. Then the few great capitals, the enormous
fortunes, open their jaws and swallow not only the
whole property of the investment-seeking public,
but also that of the small robber capitalists, whom
they usually good-naturedly allow to play around
them, looking on, like the lion at the mouse’s gam-
bols. Great depreciations of values are usually
brought about and utilised by the financial giants.
They then buy up everything that has value and a
future, to sell it again when the storm has passed
away and the skies are blue, at an enormous profit,
to the very same people who have just sold it at
such ridiculous prices. They buy it up again
during the next panic, at the same low rates, and
play the cruel game as often as a few years of
peaceful industry have refilled the emptied money-
drawers of the producing classes. Financial crises
are simply the piston-strokes with which the
capitalists pump the savings of the industrial
classes into their own reservoirs.
# * *
The advocates of speculation say that the specu-
lator plays an important and necessary role in the
great drama of political economy ; that his gams
are the results of such superior sagacity, deeper
insight, prompter decision and more adventurous
daring. This argument pleases me; let us seize
and examine it. Therefore, because the speculator
has means of information at his disposal which
are inaccessible to the general pmblic, because ho
has less dread of losses than the prudent and
honest man, and takes advantage of all possibili-
ties in a more underhanded way, he has a right to
take away from the labouring classes the results of
their labour, and allow it to accumulate for himself,
while he takes his ease. This right is consequently
based upon the fact that he has better weapons—
his sources of information, greater courage —as he
hazards only the money of others, and superior
strength of judgment and intelligence. Now let
us see if the poorer classes have not even better
weapons—rifles and dynamite bombs, greater
courage—as they are willing to risk their lives,
and superior strength —of bone and sinew. If this
is the case, and it is, the advocates of speculation
must concede to the labouring classes the right of
taking away from the speculators the results of
their so-called labour. If they do not concede
this right to the one class as well as to the other,
then the theory upon which the justification of
speculation is based, is a lie.

An Appaling Disaster!
THE RECENT CYCLONE IN AMERICA
AND ITS AWFUL RESULTS.
ITS ORIGIN SCIENTIFICALLY ACCOUNTED FOE, AND
SOME REMOTE CAUSES THAT PRODUCE PAINFUL
EFFECTS EXPLAINED.
The recent cyclone in America, which left the
Ohio Valley a scene of desolation, destroying
hundreds of lives and thousands of pounds worth
of property, has again called the attention of
scientists to these awful phenomena of Nature.
Whatever the cause is it must certainly be sought
far away from the whirling body of wind itself.
Its results are powerful; its cause must also be
powerful. Let us, therefore, consider a few facts.
The appearance of a cyclone is invariably preceded
by dark spots on the face of the sun. These spots,
indicating a disturbed condition bf the solar
system, necessarily affect the atmosphere of our
earth. Any unusual generation of heat always
creates a vacuum. Air must rush in to fill this
vacuum. Hence the disturbance which results in
the cyclone. This theory finds additional con-
firmation in the fact that, cyclones always o.cur
during the day and not at night. The dark spots
upon the surface of the sun, whatever they may
be, cause great commotion in the atmosphere of
the world. The cause is remote, but the effect is
here. This rule finds its application in nearly
every department of life. The telegraph operator
is in Paris, yet the click of the instrument
manipulated by his fingers is heard in London.
An uneasiness and disgust with everything in life,
commonly called home-sickness, is felt by many
people, when the cause is to be found in the
distant home hundreds of miles away. An un-
certain pain may be felt in the head. It is repeated
in other parts of the body. The appetite departs,
and all energy is gone. Is the c.uuc necessarily
to be found in the head ’ The next day the feel-
ing increases, There are added s-ymptoms. They
continue and become more aggravated. The
slight pains in the head increase to agonies. The
nausea becomes chronic. The neart grows
irregular, and the breathing uncertain. All these
effects have a definite cause, and in nine cases out
of ten it will be found to exist in a deranged con-
dition of the kidneys and liver, far away from
that portion of the body in which the effects
appear. But one may say, “ I have no pain what-
ever in my kidneys and liver !” Very true.
Neither have we any evidence of a cyclone on the
surface of the sun; but it is certain that the
cyclone is here. So it is with these great organs
of the body : they are the real cause of the painful
effects in other parts of the body, although there
is no pain experienced in the organs themselves.
Exactly this condition of affairs was the experience
of Mr. John Rumble, of Port Wakefield, South
Australia, whose sufferings may be imagined from
the symptoms described, which were haemorrhage,
palpitation of the heart, throbbing pains in the
head, paralysis of the bladder, and growing weak-
ness, ending in fainting, all of which indicated
disease of the kidneys and urinary organs. Under
date, July 17th, 1889, he writes During my ill-
ness I obtained medical advice, but instead of
benefiting therefrom, gradually grew worse and
weaker, until finally 1 was confined to bed and
despaired of recovery. I commenced to take
Warner’s safe cure on August 13th, with the
happy result that on the Bth September, a period
of onlv twenty one days, I was enabled to attend
to my”business. From that time the improvement
although gradual was continuous and decided, the
fluids becoming natural, and the tone of the sys-
tem, which had fallen very low from loss of blood
and exhaustion, steadily rising, until normal
strength was regained. Whilst fully recognising
the goodness of Almighty God in my restoration
to health and strength, 1 gladly bear testimony to
Warner’s safe cure as being the means or agent of
my recovery. You are at full liberty to use this
if you choose.


Fitzgerald Moore, of Melbourne, has
threatened, if he ever comes across A. G. Taylor,
who told the N.S.W. Assembly some tall things
about the bribery and corruption of hon. members,
that he will “horsewhip the scoundrel.” We
remind him that he must first lassoo the “ Giraffe.”
The very latest and most loyal cable lie
about Prince George of Wales, is to the effect
that he and two of his companions thrashed six
ruffians, who stuck them up in the streets of
Montreal and demanded money. We can readily
believe that His Royal Highness would die rather
than part with a tanner of the taxpayers’cash to
any ruffian, but wo refuse to imagine that the
band of desperadoes numbered no more than six.
Sixly was the real number. The two companions
held one assailant down, while the Prince, shout-
ing “ Ho, for England and St. George !” slew the
other fifty-nine with his noble birth.

846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, September 17,1890 t
My Dear Moorabinda, —
“Derby” day at Randwick, on 13th inst., was a jam*
crowded sporting effervescence where the brazen howl of
the bookie drowned the band, and the young man in the
checked suit and the receding forehead, who came out
confidently in a cab, might have been observed going
home sadly and significantly on foot. Regarded from a
draper’s standpoint, the meeting was a success, though
perhaps the tendency to overdo it and embody Summer
rather than Spring was noticeable here and there. But a
woman is always charming in white (save and except
when her cuticle is first-cousin to a nutmeg-grater), and
if she chooses to chance the weather, well, the airy effect
is ours, while hers is the goose-flesh, the chill, and the
sneezing, and the double-pneumonia, for ever and ever,
amen. The vice-regal party was a large one and included
Lord and Lady Carington, the Countess of Hopetoun, Sir
Charles and Lady Scott, Captain and Mrs. Acland-Hood,
&c., who perched in their carpeted cage, while behind,
before, and beside them sat a solid phalanx of females,
who glued their eyes on to the Irish Countess and only
shifted their basilisk glare to dip deep into some hat or
handbag full of carefully-doctored sweep-tags. Lady
Carington wore pale-pink and fawn silk trimmed at
the feet with fawn fringe, fawn sleeves, and a mass
of blush roses in her bonnet, and looked the
pretty figure she invariably does; the Countess
of Hopetoun, fawn cashmere with vest of folded
white silk and gold galon, bonnet in black gauze edged
w ith gold with a black aigrette rising from a cluster of
blush roses, and short black strings ; Lady Charles Scot ft
wore cream pongee figured in green made coat-wise over
a plain skirt edged with a ruche of pink and green, pink
and green ribbons floating like pennons, and a black hat
finishing: off a rather Merry-Andrewish get up; Mrs.
Acland Hood wore navy-blue pongee spotted in white
with white vest and navy-blue ribbons, black hat, with
dabs of yellow about it. The prevailing colour was un-
doubtedly all shades of heliotrope, the paler tints looking
the best form. Lilian Seccombe wore an airy gown in
white delaine flecked with pansies, the flat, white-straw
hat trimmed with white chiffon and pansies on the crown
and under the brim ; Miss Cox wore a similar frock. The
handsomest heliotrope costume had sleeves and vest of
corded silk and was topped by a scoop-hat laden with
wisteria. And just as a foil for this pretty dress the
large porpoise-outlined lady wore a mackintosh in red,
yellow, and blue quarter-acre checks and clasped to her
breast a bunchy lace parasol with a mass of marguerites
and ferns tied to the handle. A sealing-wax-haired
damsel had a golden butterfly on her shoulder and a pea-
green feather on her head ; and a curry-coloured lady in
curry colour and “Stretton” blue was en suite even to
her front teeth.
The annual ball in aid of St. Vincent’s Hospital, held in
the Centennial Hall on 10th inst., was not remarkable for
the inwardness of the coverings exhibited on the varnished
floor, and a bird's-eye view of the numerous t hrong proved
plainly that no woman could wreak a more artistic revenge
on a rival than to send her forth in a scrunched tulle
skirt, caught with sat-on artificial roses. On the dais the
dressing was not intensely special. Lady Carington wore
a terracotta gauze skirt made round, caught across on the
right side with bows of brocade, bodice of pale mastic
silk, brocaded in pale-blue, and trimmed round neck and
arm-holes with folds of the gauze and silver lace, diamond
ornaments and white kid gloves. Mrs. Murray Smith
(Vic.), black silk and chiffon with ridged sleeves, pale-grey
gloves and diamond bracelets, cap in point d’Alencon lace
and black velvet ; Miss Murray Smith, white striped
gauze and satin bodice, relieved with folds of chiffon on
the Berthe bodice, white gloves and plume fan; Mrs.
Austin, heliotrope merv covered with black lace, the front
of the gown of stripes of heliotrope and black, nosegay ol
violets; Mrs. Burdekin, sunflower-yellow brocade, the
bodice finished with folds of chiffon caugh t on each shoulder
with diamond brooches, diamond necklet, the skirt and
corsage originally relieved with clusters of crimson
and saffron roses and foliage; Miss M. Windeyer, fawn
silk with panel of brown velvet and folds on the bodice of
f»w n crepe, marigolds in the hair ; Mrs. Laidley Mort,
black silk and net, petticoat of maize-satin draped in
dotted black net, the draperies edged with gold and silver
galon ; Mrs. Andrews, black Russian net and silk bodice
lightened with orange-coloured flowers, hair « la chignon
bound about with an orange fillet; and so on, ad h •
finitum. The supper was too well done- for a charity
festival as far as the food went, but the waiting- was
decidedly inadequate.
There was no vice-regal committee bouquet at St. Vin-
cent’s ball—an omission that Lady Carington wasdevoutly
thankful for, no.doubt. That perpetual, unerring bouquet
must be a fearful bore, especially when it doesn’t har-
monise with the prevailing vice-regal tint and has as a
centre piece (as happened very recently) a flower with a
searching perfume that always gives vice-regality a head-
ache. The absence of presentation vegetables on this
occasion was, 1 believe, due to an expressed gubernatorial
wish that all the available money should go to the
liospi tab
The galvanic private secretary Helbert has elected to
cast in his lot with the impending Governor Jersey, but,
oddly enough, not as secretary. Captain Helbert will be
nominally one of Jersey’s aide-de-camps, but Sappho will
wager that half his time he will be at the,elbow of the new
secretary guiding him round local social snags, and assur*
ing him that the fact of a lady having been on intimate
terms with a beer-engine in her salad days doesn’t at all
prevent her from addressing the Countess by her Christian
i.ame. But this continuation of the Helbert plays it
lather low down on those damsels who are prinking in
anticipation of a fresh batch of unattached males to bind
Ut their cab-wheels- However, there remains Mr, Rupert
Leigh, brother to Lady Jersey (we can't get on at all now
without a “brother Rupert,” seemingly) and the hon.
gentleman with the coiling name and the snappy pronun-
ciation “Chumley;” so if only Captain H. can refrain
from relating in the shades of the smoke-room how who’s
this ran after what’s-his-name, and the awful manner in
which so-and-so angled for what-d’ye-call-him, all may
yet be well, since the last comer is always quite ready to
believe that he is the very first man she ever really loved.
It was one of the luckiest coincidences local Lotharios
ever profited by that a “ sacrifice ” glove-sale and a comic
opera both occurred in Sydney simultaneously. How
joyfully did the bald combine economy with gallantry
and sidle up to the glove-counter, where everything wag
“ marked down,” to invest in flesh-coloured kids at a
heavy discount.
Which reminds me that once upon a time Peronella
caught her Lambertuccio coming out of a glove-shop
with a trophy 16 buttons long. “For me, dear?” she
said, acid-sweetly, and he ante’d ’em up, of course. But
there were razors in the air when she got home and found
the paw-cases were five-and-a-quarter, while she took full
sevens!
The Australian Jockey Club is an inherently “swell'*
aggregate, and heretofore the pilgrim who clomb the
rickety stairs of the old premises in King-street, experi-
enced a jolt to his sense of the eternal fitness of things
when he was brought up short by the grimy door bearing
the letters “A.J.C.” But tempora mutantiir, and the
new premises at 14 Castlereagh-street are very desirable
quarters indeed. There are five rooms, the chiefest being
the committee-room—a spacious oblong, fitted to the tune
of several hundred pounds, with luxurious leather chairs
and couches and floored with a sad-toned carpet in mousey
fawns and drabs, while the walls are hung with gift
pictures of that complex animal the race-horse, to the
value of £l2OO. One picture, presented by Mr. Danger,
is the bane of all the “middle-aged” ladies who chance into
the committee-room. It is an oil of “Bay Middleton
a horse they used to lay gloves about in ’36-and they
can’t help gushing when they recognise the old flyer,
until the triumph in their friend’s eye recalls the flight of
years to them. Lord Carington has presented several
pictures of race-horses to the Club, which has dutifully
hung them in the best light possible. The entry to all
this magnificence is a very handsome cedar door relieved
With red and blue glass panels, through which the
ineffable Secretary Clibbon looks something very extra in
stained-glass saints.
The Christian concert in aid of the Criiche and the
Children’s Hospital, in Centennial Hall, on 11th inst., was
brilliantly attended in the galleries. Lady Carington
occupied a front seat in the southern gallery, attended by
Captain Helbert and Miss Walenn, and wore while
brocade and ruffles and diamonds ; Miss Walenn was in
black, and Mrs. Burdekin in yellow silk and brown velvet.
The “ baker’s dozen” items on the bill were augmented
by three encores gained by Santley and Madame Christian
who wore white arraure and a ruby necklace, and warbled
Hope Temple’s sickly “When we meet,” so that one
almost forgave its unconquerable spinelessness. Santley,
in white kid gloves, gave “ For ever and for ever,” as
usual, but the substitution of mawkish sentiment for the
really passionate original words doesn’t improve the sqng,
though it may help the singer. Kowalski was delightful
in a self-arranged paraphrase on “ Faust,” for which he
refused an encore >«nd as Cherub Huenerhein accom-
panied the warblers, the piano never went flat when the
singer was on the high sharp 0. The concert generally
was a success.
Perhaps his Scottish Excellency will be mildly hurt in
his Presbyterian susceptibilities when his little Colleen
tells him that part of Lady Hopetoun’s Sydney pro-
gramme was a Sunday spin in the vice-regal yacht on the
waters of the Beautiful Harbour. The day was warm and
bright and blue, and the expedition was quite a success.
“ Boccaccio,” at Sydney Royal, was graced on 15th inst.
by the Parliamentary Opposition, who attended the glad-
some and giddy spectacle at the invitation of Mayor
Burdekin. There were 05 legislators present in all. Nellie
Stewart was the frisky, tuneful Boccaccio. After the
opera the Opposition (who were taken out faithfully
between each act to see how the strike was progressing)
were entertained at supper at the Town-hail.
A most interesting festival was the inauguration of
Quong Tart’s “ new” salon on Bth instant, when the mem-
bers of the Women’s Literary Club (who have rented the
“salon” for their bi-monthly meetings) and several of
their friends, met at the irrepressible mandarin’s invita.
tton to fittingly open the room with a tea-and-eake orgie
at 4.30. There were nearly fifty present, including
Mrs. Windeyer, Mrs. Curnow, Mrs. H. E. Russell, Mrs. A.
J. RHey, and others—the proceedings being relieved from
monotony by the presence of a trio of very special young
men. The Literary Club now numbers thirty-five elected
members.
The seventh performance of “ Macbeth,” at Her
Majesty’s Theatre, was illumined by the presence of Lord
and Lady Carington, the Countess of Hopetoun, Miss
Walenn, and suite, while the house was S.R.O. every-
where. Lady Carington’s gown was in heliotrope-striped
silk with folds of chiffon on the bodice and medici collar,
diamond ornaments; Lady Hopetoun, in black-beaded
skirt, the bodice in black chiffon and bugles, short black
gloves, diamond bandeau and bracelets, and crescent
brooch ; Miss Walenn, pale primrose and brown silk with
Empire sash. “Macbeth” is a beautifully-staged spec-
tacle filled in with legs (masculine legs that are getting a
little devotional-looking at the knees in some instances),
and if only the drowns weren’t painfully like blanc-mange
moulds, if Flemming wouldn’t persist in looking as if he
had the ear-ache whenever a climax happens, and if Mac-
duff wouldn’t catch his knees on his garters in the quarrel-
scene, everything would be simply bliss. But why does
our George remark sententiously, “ Banquo and his
Fleauee lives ” ? Even though the divine William is re-
sponsible for such dreadful English, that is no reason why
the hard-learnt grammar of the d.c. should be stealthily
and insidiously undermined night after night.
A most delightful and successful “ at home ” was held
by Mr. and Mrs. Oharrington on the stage of Her Majesty’s
Theatre on 12th inst., when about 250 guests went and
came during the afternoon. The stage was arranged by a
Hunter-street art firm as a boudoir, with wicker furniture
draped with Art silk, the piano being shaded by a huge
Japanese umbrella, rising from a nest of flowers and tiny
electric lights. Tea and ices were served at a table on the
O.P. side, decorated with violets as the main idea, and
George Leitch and Bessie Rignold sang like “syrups,”
while a band stationed in the circle played dreamily at
intervals. Among the crush were Lady Innes and Mr.
George Innes, the Attorney-General and Mrs. Simpson,
Judge and Mrs. Windeyer, the Misses Allen, Miss Walenn,
Dr. and Mrs. Garrau and the Hisses Gafran, Mr. and Mrs.
George Rignold, Mr. William Rignold, Mrs. Brough, Miss
Fanny Ensoti, and dozens of others. Mr. and Mrs. Ghar-
rington made a tireless host and hostess, the latter wearing
a cream gown flecked with mauve, a.nd worn with white
gloves and a drawn white muslin hat, which became,her
soft, loosely-knotted hair and clear skin to perfection.
Owing to the strike a number of private dances have
been held over till the meter is a thing to be relied upon,
as no' well-regulated hostess cares to invite people to
turkey and taljow-candles or kerosene and calves’-feet
jelly. A Melbourne hostess did rise and give a dance the
other week by the light of the common or garden dip, and
her guests have been coquetting round their clothes with
damp blotting-paper and lukewarm irons ever since.
W. H. Manning, the clean-shaven genius who is running
the Charringtons through Australia, leaves for New Zea-
land on 19th inst. to arrange for their tour in the land of
tattoo. On dit that the same gentleman lately entered
into negotiations for a Sydney and Melbourne re-appear-
ance of the divine Essie Jenyns at a screw of £2OO per
week—which she declined. Two hundred a week ! What
sort of an actress could you not get for two hundred a
week certain ?
The vice-regal Spring “ at home ” on 11th inst., was not
so crowded as is usual on these occasions and few dresses
caught one’s eye otherwise than biliously. Lady Caring-
ton received at the entrance to the red drawing-room
gowned in shot-fawn-and-pink-silk relieved with velvet,
bonnet in pink roses and fawn straw, black lace and ribbon
parasol; Mrs. Murray Smith (Melbourne) wore black
corded silk, coronet bonnet in jet and gauze ; Miss Murray
Smith, pale-grey checked tweed with epaulette-topped
sleeves and collars of black velvet, the bodice ruffled in
front, hat in black gauze, daffodils and yellow ribbon ;
Miss Janet Achuroh, ivory delaine, figured electric-blue,
with electric-blue ribbons and white insertion for
trimming a black feathered hat, beauty-spot veil,
and bouquet of pansies completing a fresh Spring
toilette; Miss Posbery, black “habit” and tiny capote
of violets tied on with narrow purple velvet
ribbon ; Mrs. Laidley Mort, shot mauve-copper and
pink silk, over a brocaded vest, bonnet in copper and
electric-blue; Mrs. Spalding was Dolly Vardenish in a
pink rose-strewn gown with a big Leghorn hat and yellow
feathers; Mrs. Vandevecr Greene wore brown, with a
seal jacket with Medici collar in beaver fur and violets in
her hat; Mrs. Dan. O'Connor wore a handsome sage green
silk, designed in terra-cotta, and combined with darker
velvet, bonnet to correspond ; Lady limes appeared in
black with ostrich-feather boa. For a wonder there were
several men on view- a tall and distinguished official
from China with a bamboo outline choosing for a foil a
very email man—the combination reminding everybody
irresistably of Bouillibaisse and the “ Insect.” The feature
of the drawing-room was a cluster of girls who stood near
the door criticising the incoming tide. Certainly some of
their strictures were merited, but I don’t suppose their
subdued mirth made the embarrassed feel more at ease,
and several times the amiable vice-regal eye was cast in-
quiringly in their direction.
Yours affectionately,

The British Inland Revenue’s analyst,
Dr Bell, lately told a Parliamentary Committee
that out of nine samples of brandy selected for
analysis four were genuine, and five were not
brandy at all. Out of 24 samples of rum 14 were
genuine and 10 coloured spirit from Rotterdam or
Hamburg. He added that the “best” foreign
spirit is purer than the British article.
The writer of the Argus’ London gossip
s ays of Lord Jersey:—
I remember him very good-looking as a boy, but as
years go on his fair complexion and delicate skin seem
hardly able to maintain their pristine harmonies against
the buffeting of our cruel climate. Australia will no doubt
restore his complexion.
Which, being interpreted, simply means that Lord
Jersey has freckles, and wants us to help scrub
them off. All we can say is that our brick is
ready.
- Chinese Gordon used to tell a story of
how he crushed a mutiny among his Chinese
forces, caused by bad rations and stopped pay.
He had the mutineers drawn up in line and stood
in front of them, accompanied by half-a-dozen
trusty cut-throats armed with loaded rifles.
“Now,” he said, “you must have some leaders;
let them stand out and I’ll speak to them. ” There
was a moment’s pause. “Come, fall out!” said
Gordon again, in a cool, every-day voice, as if he
were ordering dinner. The men looked at one
another, and stirred in their places, as his keen
eye ran along the ranks. Then two men stepped
forward. Gordon quietly gave a signal to his
half-dozen men with loaded rifles, and the next
moment the two ringleaders were shot dead. So
ended the mutiny. “ But I always think,” Gordon
used to say, meditatively, after telling the story—
“I always think I murdered those men.”
Icebergs have some interest for Australia,
as every sailing-ship which voyages round the
Horn has to risk destruction from this cause. The
Marlborough clipper, from Port Lyttelton to
London, which was lately posted as missing, and
in all human probability sank after colliding with
ice, and two other sailing-ships are now so long
overdue that (like the Loch Maree, Loch Fyne,
Strathnever, and many others which left Austra-
lian ports years ago never to return) they probably
came to grief on some drifting rock of ocean.
A letter addressed to London Daily Chronicle
on the subject of Atlantic ice, in which the writer
advocates that bergs in the track should be fired
at and torpedoed by men-of-war, has been exten-
sively re-printed in Australia. However, it is not
easy to see that such operations would not inten-
sify the evil they are designed to cure. It is easier
to avoid a mountainous berg than, it is to get away
from ice on the water-level, and it must be remem-
bered that an iceberg floats with but one-third of
its total bulk above water.

The local member had died of drink and
pimples and rush Of blood to the head, and there
was a vacancy in his dusty, poverty-stricken
electorate in the lonely north-west. I he district
consisted chiefly of gullies and old stumps and an
ash-cat with a broken tail, but public feeling ran
high all the same, and when a short, flabby, and
desperately fat man came up from Brisbane and
wanted the suffrages of the electors it was felt to
be a gratuitous insult. He was shaped like a peg-
top and he evidently hadn’t seen Ins own feet
since he was a child ; and his skin hung about him
in great flaps so as to accommodate more fat when
he could get it. He was filled with childlike
innocence, too, and he had an alarmed baby-stare
in his eyes, and an apologetic expression all over
his face, and he ate like a hungry pestilence; and
he had only one speech ready, which lie discharged
monotonously at one meeting after another with a
maddening iteration which no hying man could
endure. The speech was tangled up beyond
human comprehension at the start, and it grew
worse every time it was deli vered. 1 he candidate
h id vague ideas that Queensland ought to own at
least one large ironclad, and was of opinion that
it ought to be raised from the seed and grown in a
drv spot, and he thought that the standard of
education was not sufficiently high and that a
carpenter should be sent for to raise it immediately,
and by-and-bye even these scraps of knowledge
deserted him, and when he met the electors he
merely mumbled and perspired. Then the big,
prize rowdy of the district began to haunt his
meetings, and he would sit in the front seat and
ask the harmless candidate why he didmt work off
his superfluous fat, or else he would inquire if ho
put on his boots over the back of his? head seeing
that he couldn’t possibly reach them from the
front, and the candidate would glare, at him like
an irritated consignment of butter, and say
nothing. And so things went on till the. night
before the election, when the unhappy politician
held a final meeting, and, after urging his supporters
to vote straight, he rashly endeavoured to quote
a few lines of appropriate verse, but unhappily
the verse deserted him, and as he stood with Ins
immense mouth open, wondering where the lost
poem had gone to, his enemy deliberately fired a
potato into it. There was a shriek of fiendish
laughter from the audience and a howl of male-
volent derision, and the politician waddled to the
front of the platform and asked the huge individual
below if he did that on purpose He taid that he
did. Then with an unexpected jump the bland,
fat man quitted his elevated position, and per-
forming a hurried flight through the air he arrived
with both feet on his opponents chest, and the
chair beneath him giving way they landed to-
gether with a fearful crash on the floor, and break-
ing through it they vanished amid . a. cataclysm of
broken boards and dust and exploded furniture
into the foundations of the hall. It took about
twenty minutes to extricate them by means of
ropes and a ladder, and when they, were dragged
out the public man reascended the platform and
stated that he would pay the cost of repairing hi
antagonist and make good the damage to tne
building, in addition to which he had resolved to
withdraw from politics and shout for the crow .
And then he seized his carpet-bag and sped down
the road to the railway-station with his hair full
of splinters and pieces of broken chair, ana 1
turbulent constituents of the wild, rowdy wes
saw him no more.
The young gentlemen residing at a Dar-

This, it would seem, is not enough, so the treasury
is going to make him a present of some £54,000.
Another £2000 a year pension has been going into
the pockets of Lords Exmouth since 1814 for the
naval services of one of their progenitors, and the
present holder of the title will shortly receive a

locusts have been fattening on the community at

Tales of “The System.”
X.—“ Special Commission Sunday.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In a book bearing the title “Wanderings
by Houth and East,” written by one Walter Coote,
F.R.G.S., and published by Messrs. Sampson’
Low and Qo., London, in the year 1882, there is,
on page,3s, this passage :
\\ e saw the chapel now in ruins where the prisoners all
assembled for prayer and service. There is a raised dais
at one end upon which a company of soldiers was drawn
up with loaded arms. As we stood in the ruined chapel
ooi" thoughts could' not but wander back to one fatal day
when-some sign of rebellion being shown, during God’s
service and before His very altar, the word “ Fire !” was
given, and 20 or 30 were killed or wounded. What a
ghastly scene ! The service stopped, the chaplain hurry-
ing to the vestry, the officers’ wives and children fainting
and crying, and the stern soldiers shooting down the
prisoners in the very House of God ! Of such was life in
those old, convict days. I believe no one could draw too
dark a picture.
The heading of the chapter from which we make
this quotation, is ‘‘ Norfolk Island. ”
The critic of a London paper, in reviewing Mr
Coote’s volume, observed ;
NVe have been at some pains to investigate official re-
cords, and can discover no evidence to justify us in be-
lieving that any such incident (as that described in our
extract) ever occurred. We are accordingly compelled to
place the author among those “ globe-trotters ” who, bent
upon “ making a-book ” out of their voyagings, are re-
duced to the invention of sensational “facts ” when their
powers of observation fail to furnish them with sufficiently
interesting matter.
We will not stop here to suggest that had Mr.
Coote, F.R.G.S., headed the chapter in question
“Cayenne” or “New Caledonia,” the English
critic would probably have seen nothing excep-
tional in the catastrophe recorded ; but will in-
stantly proceed to contradict the reviewer with the
remark that the author,'in the above passage, dis-
played less than the usual inaccuracy of the
“ globe-trotter ” who puts his experiences into
P rmfc - Mr. Coote erred in one slight particular
only. The occasion for the slaughter of 11 felons
and the wounding of 17 others was not “some
sign of rebellion ; ” was, indeed, much less valid
than any act of unmistakable mutiny would have
been; was, as a simply, undisguised fact, nothing
more than the cause disclosed by this narrative
* # *
The circumstance that the reviewer could
find no official evidence to warrant his belief in
Mr. Coote’s story is worth absolutely nothing as a
canon of verification. One of the arts that at-
tained to a deadly luxuriance of growth in the
penal atmosphere was that of the suppression or
distortion of awkward facts. It was almost
scientific in the exactness and universality of its
operation throughout the whole area of the
System. From a Governor-General, who packed
his despatch-box for No. 14 Downing-street with
rubbish and then accused the messenger of stealing
the papers, to the storekeeper’s-clerk who stole a
hospital - ration of rum, or the farm-overseer
who lied as never Trojan lied to curry
favour with his superintendent (though every
letter of his lies left a livid lash-mark on the
back of a Convict); there was no degree of ad-
ministration that, at times, failed to “cook” its
reports. Had the suyyestio falsi, as a method of
sophistry, not been already in use, the System
would have invented it. At Sydney, at Hobart
Town, at Norfolk Island, the game of suppression
went merrily on. Tt knew no limits of time or
latitude—in Trafalgar’s year jt was played as gaily
in 9 e 9 r g e -street, Sydney, as it was in the
Thirties” in the Commandant’s cottage at Port
Arthur, or in the holy “Forties” at Murray-
street, Hobart Town. By bonfire at Bathurst,
by erasing-knife at Sydney, by sinking “ten
fathoms deep ” m D'Entrecasteaux Channel, the
System pursued its humorous policy of suppression
and falsification. In this particular respect it
might have arrogated to itself the proud boast of
Semper cadem, for it was always the same.
There was one thing, however, to which the
System could not apply the sponge ; and that was
to the retentive tablets of the human brain. It tried
its best in this direction also, by killing a consider-
able percentage of its subjects and by brutalising
more. But its efforts were only partially successful,
* * *
When the Governor Phillip brig, Bowses
captain, V.D.L. Government (Penal Depart-
ment), owner, made her 39th trip by returning to
Norfolk Island from that voyage to Hobart Town,
on which, among other freight, she had carried
the jocular Convict No. 6006,* she brought with
her that potent and imposing body—the Special
Commission.
* * #
The Special Commission was an ingenious
invention of the System for depriving the more
desperate Islanders of one of their favourite
recreations. This was a sea-trip, supplemented by
a couple of appearances in public. Shortly after
arrival at the vessel’s destination—which, before
the transfer of the Island to V.D.L., was Sydney,
before the origination of the Commission, the
expenditure of a little trouble never failed to
obtain the privilege of such an excursion. The
essential preliminary was at the command of
everyone. For anyone, you see, had the amplest
opportunities for murder.
That was the one thing needful to the enjoy-
ment of a voyage “ ’neath azure skies and ’cross
smiling seas,” as Judge Barron Field wrote in one
of those moments which, in the intervals of pass-
ing death-sentences, he devoted to the Muses,
Any convict who wearied of the daily round of
brutish task-work, whose ears, designed, perhaps,
to distinguish the faintest music breathed by the
countless siren voices of Nature, grew tired of the
monotonous ringing of chains and the ding-dong
of yard-bells, or on whose sight palled alike the
vivid beauty of the landscape and the shimmer of
green and white from the imprisoning ocean,
could, if he so desired, break the monotony which
held him more rigorously than his fetters. He had
but to knock somebody on the head and the thing
was done. “Gov’ment” did all the rest. Gov’-
ment supplied him with the free passage to the
great city by Port Jackson, and supplied him,
moreover, in its surpassing generosity with the
wherewithal for yet another journey : with the
black cap, and the pine coffin, and a quicklimed
grave.
It is not, therefore, particularly astonishing to
learn from a Supreme Court Judge of the period
that, the reward being so exceedingly rich, the
paltry exertion necessary to secure it should con-
stantly—the word is used with a full apprehension
of its meaning—be put forth by the prisoners.
Not a fortnight went by for several years with-
out a murder being perpetrated, for which the
solo discoverable reason was the overpowering
See The Bulletin, 13th Squ7,Ts9o7“ The Little JolTe
of Convict No. 6000.” •
craving for “th’ trip to th’ capital.” Then the
System found that the practice was getting too
expensive, and it did its best to stop it by with-
holding the reward. The System could not afford
to pay for these passages to Sydney, and for all
the paraphernalia of a trial and execution, for any
felon who wanted a holiday ;■ so it resolved to try
and hang (sometimes the terms didn’t mean the
same thing), capital offenders on the Island itself.
The Special Commission was the resulting ex-
pedient. It was ever so much cheaper to send up
the Commission once a year to place on their trial
sixty or seventy capitally-indicted convicts than
to bring that number down to the city. This was
the primary reason; and a secondary one of
scarcely less importance was that the busy-body
public would not learn so much about the way
penal affairs were being managed.
To say the Island felonry were pleased at the
alteration would not be true. Prisoners had been
hanged in Penal Australasia that Judges should
not be too late for the soup at a public dinner.
Why, then, if a prisoner had to hang for a Judge’s
pleasure, should he be deprived of the opportunity
of hanging for his own? As illustrating the
temper of the Island population at this epoch, we
may quote an historic conversation.
When the intention of the authorities to
establish the Commission became known to the
insular transports, they deputed one of their
number a fellow .who began his criminal career
as an incendiary Luddite—to interview the Civil
Commandant on the question. The ex-rioter was
chosen as spokesman because of his supposed
acquaintance with constitutional law, which
reputed accomplishment had won for him the
appellation of “Counsellor Jock.”
“ Mr. Spragge,” he had said to the O.C. at the
following Sunday muster, as soon as the mustering
warder had called out—“ Any complaints?”—
“Mr. Spragge, yer ’Onor, I’ve been axed, sir, to
ax yer ’bout this ’ere new Cumishun ?”
“ Well, my man,” affably replied Mr, Scragge :
“ and what about it ? ”
Is it true, sir, as thet W’e’re not to go to th’
Cap tul to be ’ung—leastwise, them of uz as is
a-goin’ to be worked orf ?”
“Do you mean is it true that all capital offences
are to be tried here in future, instead of being sent
down ?”
“Yes, yer ’Onor, thet’s wot I do mean.”
“ Then I have very much pleasure in replying
in the affirmative ! ” rejoinded courteous Mr.
Scragge.
“Well, sir, I’m axed to say this—thet we per-
test agen enythink o’ th’ sort. It’s uncon-sff-
toosh’nal, thet’s wot ’tis, Mr. Scragge. Them as
is to be ’ung ’as a right to be scragged—no, sir, I
beg yer pardin’, I don’t mean thet, sir; ’twas a
slip o’ th’ tongue—
(Signs of a tempest were lowering on the C.C.’s
features. His unfortunate surname was a sore
point with him.)
“Wot I mean, sir,” the Counsellor went on, “is
thet execushuns must be in public. Ain’t thet th’
lor, sir ? ”
Offended Mr. Scragge nodded.
“Now, sir, yer know as it’s been decided thet
inside a prisun ain’t a public place ? ”
The C.C. didn’t respond to this interrogatory.
He was beginning to see the point to which Jock’s
Socratic inquiries were leading. The man con-
tinued—
“ Well, ain’t Norfo’k Island a prisun, sir—a
legwlly proclaimed prison? An’ yer can’t ’ang uz
legally inside o’ it! ” concluded the convict, with
an accent of triumph in his voice.
The Commandant, for a second, resolved t
maintain a dignified silence; and, inasmuch as h°
could not controvert the argument, to treat it with
affected contempt. However, a happy thoutrl 2
struck him. '
“Can’t we? Then I’ll tell you what we’ll do
We sail the brig out three miles from the s ] lol ,‘
and hang you there!” Mr. Scragge laughed -o
his own pleasantry, and his officers laughed with
him. But the Luddite was not yet defeated 1
“No, yer oudn’t, Mr. Scragge, if you’ll
me, sir, from a contradictin’ o’ yer. Yer’d 1
’angin’ uz on th’ ’igh seas, an’ th’ ’igh seas ain’t S
public place ’ within th’ meanin’ o’ the Hact!” a
Mr. Scragge being “ cornered ” once more, again
failed to answer, and his interlocutor pushed lm
advantage. 18
“Now, sir, why does th’Lor order execushuns to
take place in public? Jest this, sir—l’m op’ n to
‘krectshun, sir—thet pe’ple shall see as th’
wrong man ain’t ’ung. Now, sir, if you W u t
°ef th’ I’land nobody cud be present at the execi/
shun as belonged to th’ public-ship’s crew ain’t
public—they’re sarvants o’ Gov’munt.”
Mr. Scragge was getting tired and grumpy so
he interrupted roughly. •’'
“ We’ve had enough of this, Counsellor. Gal.
lows-law isn’t a complaint. If you have no com!
plaint to make, fall back to your rank. ”
“ Well, sir, my ’plaint is this—you’ve po right
to ’ang men ’ere—yer must ’ang ’em w’ere there’s a
public. Unless yer’ve got a public yer might
work orf th’ wrong man—yer might show fav’rit

Counsellor Jock’s protest received the acknovv-
ledgment from the C.C. of “ six-hours’ gag ” for a
“frivolous complaint” {vide Regulation, No. 71
in that case made and provided) and the untimely
end of his existence a year subsequently, precluded
his learning that, in the year 1853, a Tasmanian
Attorney-General adopted ah almost precisely
similar view of the question. In connection with
which legal opinion it is satisfactory to relate that
the great law-officer of the Crown just referred to
placed on record his further declaration “that it
was an occasion for deep regret that so many execu-
tions had been permitted at Norfolk Island when
their legal validity was liable to be impugned.”
This admission was, at the time, pronounced by
some narrow-minded and prejudiced persons as a
scandalous accusation against the System ; but we
submit that it should rather have been'regarded as
an additional, demonstration that the -noblest
attribute of British Justice was its readiness to
atone for former judicial and administrative
errors. Surely nothing could be more consoling
to the relatives of the hundreds of persons hanged
at the Island than the knowledge of the fact that
“Gov’ment” had confessed (though certainly a
little late in the day) the illegality of these execu-
tions ?

It is a recognised fact that mutton is
frequently goat, but it is supposed to be goat sub
rosa, and in as unobtrusive a manner as possible,
in order not to arouse prejudice and ill-feeling.
But the other day a presumably sane and collected
Australian butcher stated in open court that the
public had no particular right to complain, so far
as he saw, even if their mutton was openly and
glaringly goat. This is too much. The dejected
beast with a broken tail, whose .d ustyjjilhouette
stands out conspicuously in the gloom’as he sends
up his .soft, sad song to the silent sky, Js not an
attractive article of food, fie is aggravating at
night, when the black interrogation-point of his
crinkled horn blots-out the rising moon; he is
offensive in the day-time and obnoxious in the
twilight. He moons about in a lonely, leprous
way, and eats barrel-hoops, bustles, old
hats, and the washing off the line. Dtied shark,
regarded as a steady article of food, has its
advantages; and emu, considered in the light of
refreshment, has many points which should not
be overlooked; but the man who endeavours to
trade off goat on a gentle and childlike community
ought to be, &c., &c. ~ i

done the next thing’ to that most beneficent of
acts. She had endowed him with a numerous and
widely-distributed circle of “powerful friends.”
It was one of his boasts that he could, blindfolded,
stick a pin into any page of the Pension and
Allowances Return, called for by Mr. Joseph
Hume, M.P., and never miss pricking the name
of some family connection. Be this as it may, he
had held a succession of highly-paid sinecures
under the Home Government. The arduous duty
of affixing, monthly, his signature to a Treasury
salary-warrant had so affected his health, that his
doctor recommended a long absence from work
and a sea-voyage, and, in pursuance of this alarm-
ing advice, he had, after a trip to India, found his
way to Sydney and thence to Hobart Town, where
a relative occupied the Governorship. His Excel-
lency, desiring that his young kinsman should
enlarge his knowledge of H.B;M.’s glorious empire
of the sunny South, had nominated him as Special
Commissioner to Norfolk Island, in which capacity
he would not only visit the Paradise of the Pacific
and so extend his acquaintance with her Majesty’s
realms, but pocket an honorarium of two hundred
and fifty guineas. The appointment was at once
ratified by the Executive Council, who considered
themselves as exceedingly fortunate in securing an
English gentleman whose social standing was as
unimpeachable as his legal attainments.
* # *
The issue of the Commission was, it is
true, challenged as “an infamous job,” and “ an
act of nepotism rivalling in malodorousness the
worst appointments of a Tory Ministry,” by a
truculent journalist named Andrew Bent, but the
denunciations of that disreputable fellow had no
other effect than to elicit a couple of sound obser-
vations at the Council-table. The scribbler had,
among other things, charged Mr. Gaythorpe
“ with being innocent of all legal learning other
than could be acquired by virtue of the silly pro-
cess of eating his term dinners, and the sillier pro-
cess still of being ‘called,’” and it was to this
particular assertion that two influential members
of the Executive addressed themselves,
“If, as a jurist, Mr. Gaythorpe’s name was
unknown to his profession, it was doubtless only
because he had been free from the vulgar necessity
of practising.”
This wasthe Colonial Secretary’s opinion, and
his Lordship the Bishop clinched it by cordially
affirming that, “assuming for the sake of argument
—he wished it to be distinctly understood that he
made the assumption only in that sense—that
the gentleman in question was—er—innocent—
er—of legal learning— er—that it was rather an
advantage than otherwise, as (and he made the
remark with diffidence and with great respect to
the legal members of the Council) it had sometimes
been—er—insinuated that —er—former Special
Commissioners had acted—er—more in accordance
with legal technicalities—than strict (if he might
use the term) equity.” After this, there was, of
course, nothing to be said, except to suggest the
prosecution of Printer Bent for libel.
* * *
It was under these circumstances, just
described, and with powers of “ high justice ’’that
Mr. Archibald Julian Gaythorpe landed at Nor-
folk Island. He was accompanied, in an official
relation, by the Attorney-General, and in a
friendly one by the Reverend Theophilus Ford—
who has already been introduced to Bulletin
readers. Parson Ford, who had assumed the
office of a convict chaplaincy less from pecuniary
pressure than from a stupid notion that he could
spiritually influence the transports, had become,
in twelve years, one of the most enlightened of the
System’s administrators. His feelings, which had
once been attuned to a sweet sympathy with every
form of human woe, were now responsive only to
the touch of the Penal Establishment. He lived
in the System, and it in him. There was no
variety of penal duty for which he had not
qualified himself ; none, indeed, (save that of hang-
man) which he had not performed. He had
temporarily acted as Comptroller, and frequently
as constable. And with respect to his own pastoral
functions, he displayed a unique energy. He
never spared himself in his work or discriminated
as to his duties. He was as ready to examine a
girl at the Brickfields Barrack as to the paternity
of her unlegalised offspring, or to threaten a
supposed thief with all the terrors of earth and
hell till he “ gurgled-up the receiver,”# as he was
to attend with the last consolations of the Church
on a party of the Condemned. And nothing, so
apostolic was his zeal,- cotfld give him greater
pleasure than his receipt of a note from the
Under-Sheriff, worded something like this ;
_ ~ Sheriffs Office, Sunday Evening.
Mr Dear Mr. Foap, — Just a word to remind you of to-
morrow morning’s little ceremony. Commission for 10.
Usual hour,—Sincerely yours,-
(Sd.) William Ropbwbll.
Now, Parson Ford, feeling physically and
mentally run down, and desirous of a change,
j l ® would join the Special Commission.
“The trip Wbuld do him good,” he had said,
“and from what he had heard, he thought
Brother Taylor would have his hands full if all
these rioters were left for execution, so his
assistance would be useful.” He had thoroughly
enjoyed the uneventful fortnight which the old
tub of a Wig had occupied in making the Island,
and so delightful was his companionship, and so
amusing his reminiscences of convict-life, that his
fellow-passengers in the Governor Phillip’s cabin
felt nothing of tedium. Once a man could close
his ears to the tragic note of the System, there was
a good deal of the comic element about it to be
enjoyed. And the hour when the Rev. Theophilus
had become deaf to its moan had long gone by.
• * *
The brig had arrived off the Point on a
Friday evening, but thp bar was impassable by the
surf-boats till the following day; so it was the
Saturday afternoon before the official announce-
ment of the landing of the Commission was made
and before the prisoners waiting trial, numbering
some three score, were notified to present them-
selves with their counsel pn the following Monday
forenoon at 10 of the clock. On the Saturday
evening the Coinm,andant had given a dinner in
formal honour of the Commissioner and the other
distinguished visitors. The feast, towards the
small hours of “Special Commission Sunday”
(the clergy had retired at the first stroke of 12),
became a carouse, which was directly responsible
for massacre referred to by Mr. Coote,
The Sabbath sun rose with a golden pink that
promised a tropic heat before noon, so Mr. Archi-
bald Julian Gaythorpe, somewhat disturbed in
brain and temper by his potations, made the
warmth of the day an cxeii'c for not presenting
himself at the forenoon service. His intimation
however, failed to reach the civil and military
authorities in time to prevent the turn out of the
“ Protestant prisoners for Church ” and the accom-
panying soldier guard It was an indispensable
point of routine that every Special Commission
.cssion should be inaugurated by a sermon to the
Commissioner as a sort of anointing or sanctifying
process ; and as Parson Ford’s discourse—carefully
re-wntten and localised for the occasion from an
assizei sermon delivered at Chester—could not well
be delivered to Mr. Gaythorpe while that person-
age remained inside of the Commandant’s best
bedroom in company with a headache and a bottle
of brandy, second service was ordered for the
afternoon. The morning liturgy was accordingly
shortened by the omission of the Litany and the
postponement of the sermon.
* * * .
The promise of the dawn was more than
fulfilled. A sultry glory held possession of the
Island at noontide, and as the orb of day westered
the heat grew more intense. It diffused a drowsi-
ness over every form of life. The pines drooped
from them stateliness and the king-fern curled his
fronds, while the delicate lace-work of the maiden-
hair shrivelled even in her shadowed nooks. All
bird-voices were stilled, save the exultant cry of
the wedge-tailed eagle as he sailed majestically in
the air-currents above the heat-burdened strata of
the lower atmosphere. The very waves slumbered,
and the surf-ridges that a day or two agone
laughed their derisive ha ! ha ! in the face of man.
now pulsed with the still breathing of a sleeping
child.
The human creature alone was in motion. The
clank of fetters and the ring of musket-stocks, the
shuffle of ironed feet and the disciplined tread of
manly steps, spoke of the massing of the felonry
and of the felons’ guards. Into the “ well ”of the
chapel filed the former, and the soldiers followed
them through an ivied archway that seemed a relic
of some Gothic ruin which had nestled once in a
sequestered valley in an English county. As the
prisoners separated into the narrow passages be-
tween the rows of forms, the soldiers were halted
for a moment , and then, facing to the right and
left by half-companies, they were marched on to
the platform that filled one side of the chapel,
At a word from Lieutenant Budgeon, the officer
of the guard, the red-coated figures sat down on
two long seats, one raised above the other, which
ran the length of the dais. Another command
and the shotted muskets were brought to the
position in which they would remain for an hour
—two, perhaps, if Parson Ford were not merciful.
The front-rank men held their guns slopingly
across their knees. The muzzles covered some 200
men in the rear rows. Each of the rear-rank
guard rested his on the shoulder of a front-ranker—
not on that of the man immediately before him, but
on the left shoulder of the next man to the right.
The second line of muskets commanded the 300
transports who occupied the farther section. On
the extreme right of the back seat was the position
custom assigned to the officer in command,
whence he could survey the whole interior. Facing
the military guard was the organ-loft; to their
left the pulpit and lectern rose on cither hand of
the railed space which served as chancel. Crimson
curtains hung from rods passing the full width of
the structure, a few feet away from the rail-
ings, separated the “free” from the bond. A
row of muskets, grasped by the armed civil guard,
formed a grim lining to the bright-hued cloth and
an additional menace to the grey-and-yellow-
garbed worshippers. It was under such conditions'
that the System preached the Gospel, Sunday
by Sunday, to those who were, very emphatically,
“ spirits in prison.” It would not deny them
glad tidings of great joy, but it would give them
to its children in its own way. It tendered them
the Divine Grace at the point of the bayonet and
the rim of the musket-barrel.
* * #
The organ pealed out its opening voluntary.
How the prisoners loved that organ ! There was
no reason why they should not, as being the Pev
Mr. Taylor’s private property, the System had
nothing to do with it. Of small volume and a far
from copious variety of sound, the instrument had
a rare sweetness of tone that awoke in its convict
auditors the infinity of soul that their gaol sur-
roundings could not altogether cramp. Touched
by Mrs. Taylor’s sympathetic fingers, its notes
spoke to them of another world than the one to
which they were moored like Lucifer on the Lake
°f Hell. It gave bodily shape and substance to
the colour and beauty which Nature spread over
their prison-isle, and which, so debasing was the
influence of their habitual brutishness, they could
hardly believe was true—could scarcely regard it
as aught but an entrancing mirage. Smiled on
daily by the softest and bluest of skies, its witchery
never stole into their hearts till the organ pro-
claimed their kinship with the eternal world, and
that other sphere where spirits out of prison lived
and moved, and had their being. When the in-
strument sang, it filled the sin-stained breasts
with unutterable aspirations. When it sobbed,
subtle ideas, embassies of “worlds not quickened
by the sun,” stirred brains dulled bv routine.
When it sighed,
The silence that is in the starry sky,
The. sleep that is among the lonely hills,
became audible to embruted ears. Its master-
chords called up to some men visions of dear home
faces and cherished English scenes ; and to others
as the melody faded into the key of the sub-
dominant,
The silent spectacle—the gleam—
The shadow—and the peace supreme,
of some great Cathedral Minster, where they had
worshipped once ! Once —but, ah! so long ago, so
long ago!
Mrs. Taylor swept the keys that Commission
bunday with more than her usual depth of passion.
Perhaps some fore-reaching filament of the im-
pending horror touched her, but she played as she
had never played before, and, as she ended, a
peculiar sound that was neither a sob nor a sigh,
but like unto both, rose from the grey and yellow
ranks, as an echo to the dying chord.
“ It seemed to hie,” she said, simply, to her
husband that night, “like an angel’s heart-
break. ”
He chided her for her wild fancy, but told her
he had overheard a remark from Johnson, leader
of the D gang, who expected to be sentenced to
death in a day or two.
“ Goochy,” he had whispered to Gooch, “ d d
if thet music don’ make me feel so thet I b’leeve
I’ll be good till —till ’morrer mornin’.” There
was a tear in the parson’s eye as he remarked that
to win even that much from Johnson he would
give a year of his life.
* * *
If such was the voluntary’s effect on
Richard Johnson, No. 4563 per Rodney, its in-
fluence on Lieutenant Budgeon, officer of the
guard, was very different. He was very tired was
the Lieutenant; he had drunk heavily at the
previous night’s debauch; he had already sat out
one dreary service that day; and his mid-day
lunch had been a hearty one. The drowsiness of
the afternoon pursued him to his sheltered corner,
and he had scarcely taken his seat before the
soporifics just mentioned had their number and
power increased by Mrs. Taylor’s organ-playing.
He noticed that Mr, Commissioner Gaythorpe,
attended by Mr. Attorney-General Waring and
Civil Commandant Scr*gge, had managed to make
his way with erratic gait tp the principal pew
behind the coloured curtains; and he saw the
ladies of the garrison (among them his wife and
daughter) escorted by his brother-officers into the
officers’ pews. Then, somehow, his conscious-
ness slipped away from him on a note of the
music, and he fell asleep.
* # #
He was asleep when the voluntary ceased,
and the Rev. Mr. Taylor began the Versicles.
The rustling of the leaves, when such of the convicts
as could read opened their copies of Bishop Mant’s
“Form of Prayer for Prisoners,” did not disturb
him.
He was asleep as the Rev. Mr. Ford pronounced
the Absolution.
He was partially roused at the Psalms for the
Day, but the monotonous reading of the Lesson
by Mr. Taylor sent him once more into sound
slumber. Fven the giving-out by Chaplain Ford,
and the singing by the congregation, of Psalm
cvn., second part, “as newly versified by Brady
and Tate”—-
Soma lie, with darkness compass’d round
In death's uncomfortable shade,
And with unwieldy fetters bound,
By pressing cares more heavy made—.
did not awake him fully. He half-opened his
eyes, only to close them again immediately.
He was still shyping when Mr. Taykr began
the Litany—sleeping and dreaming.
He stirred slightly as the supplication “ From
lightning and tempest, from p'ague, pestilence, and
famine, from batt'e and murder, and from sudden
DEATH ” was uttered by the clergyman, and re-
sponded to by the inattentive mass—all more or
less succumbing to drowsiness—in a garbled mono-
tone, *■ Good Lord, deliver us!”
He turned in his seat, and muttered as the
minister prayed—“ That it may please thee to bless
and preserve Adelaide the Queen Dowager, the
Prince Consort, Albert Prince of Wales, and all the
Royal Family ’’ and as the congregation murmured
“ TFe beseech thee to hear us, good Lord ” muttered
and turned restlessly, as though sadly troubled by
his dreams.
And as supplication after supplication fell from
the priestly lips, and as response after response
was breathed by the worshippers unto the throne
of Him before Whom there was no distinction of
“ bond ”or “ free he still slept.
He slept on till the voice of the preacher uttered
that most pathetic of petitions, that prayer whose
every syllable is a tear-drop—
“ That it may please thee to preserve all that travel
by land or by water, all women labouring of child,
all sick persons, and young children; and to show
thy pity upon all prisoners and captives
and then he started up violently with the tremors
of a hideous dream shaking every nerve of his
body, and mingling a delirious bitterness with his
cry, shouted out : “ No, no !—no pity—the
children— Fire ! ”
Never had Litany so awful an antiphon.
Overcome by the sultriness of the hour, the
men of the guard who were never permitted to
change their positions—who never knelt at prayers
and never rose to chant or sing—were, most of
them, ih semi-slumber as the last dreadful word
fell on their ears.
The first thing taught a convict-guard was to be
ready to fire in an instant; the last thing taught
him was to be ready to fire at any instant : all in-
termediate instructions trended from the one point
to the other. The whole duty of the soldier to
Queen and Country was summed up in the one
phrase : “Be ready, aye ready—to fire.” When
on duty there was to be no break in the subtle
telegraphic line which linked the ear and the
trigger-finger.
Had the men been fully awake the majority of
them would still have fired; they might have seen
no reason for the command, and still they would ■
have fired ; it was not their place to “reason why.”
Half-asleep, as most were, no sooner had the
fatal syllable been uttered than their tense nerves
gave forth a grim, mechanic reply—and sixty-
three out of eighty muskets belched forth the
Divine pity upon certain helpless prisoners and
captives, and made of the House of God a
shambles.
Yes, Divine pity ! The phrase is repeated, and
with reverence. It was an act of the truest mercy,
that volley; although they “broke” Lieutenant
Budgeon for giving the command, and flogged at
the halberts seventeen men for disobeying it. It
was merciful in this : that it sent eleven men out
of the world at once, and some others a few hours
later, who, in all human probability, would have
perpetrated terrible crimes in order to achieve the
death which came to them unsought on the Special
Commission Sunday of November, 184—.‘
* # #
When Budgeon was court-martialled at
Hobart Town (Vane, senior captain of the Onety-
Oneth’s, was president of the court), he had no
defence to offer, except that he had fallen asleep,
and, in his dream, had revived the memory of the
attack of D. Gang on the pic-nic party.* To this
the words “women, children, and pity,” used by
the clergyman, must have connected themselves—
as actually passing events so curiously do with
dream phenomena—and, under the vivid impres-
sion that the convicts were in Tevolt, he must have
made the death-dealing exclamation. Of course,
the defence was no defence at all—it rather
heightened the crime—for, in the president’s
words, “ it was exceedingly shameful for an officer
to fall asleep when on guard.” He was accord-
ingly cashiered from the army with every form of
ignominy. But the System found a billet for him
as Superintendent at Ross Probation Station, vice
Angus, promoted to Port Arthur.

Galvanic Battery
Is acknowledged by Eminent Physicians, and by-
thousands of sufferers to be a positive Remedy for
nearly all the ailments mankind is heir to. The effi-
cacy of this Wonderful Invention as a curative agent
is certainly The Crowning Medical and Scien-
tific Triumph of the 19th Century. '
This BATTERY is not larger than a half-crown
piece, and is worn on the chest, next the skin, suspen-
ded by a silk cord around the neck/ The several
metals of which it is composed are so arranged that the
natural humidity of the skin is sufficient to set the chem-
icals in the amalgamated metals in motion, generating
a constant but gentle flow of Electricity which passes
from the Battery into the system, purifying the Blood,
strengthening the Nerves'Brain and Muscles, infusing
fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.
The Battery will cure the following ailments :
Headache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Ulcers,
and Tumors, Nervous Debility, Impotence, Liver Com-
plaints, Fever and Ague, Disease of the Kidneys and
Urinal Organs, Bronchitus, Asthma, Diphtheria, Fits,
Constipation, Piles, Heart Disease, Paralysis, Disease
Of the Lungs and Throat, Skin Disorders, and almost,
cveryform of Aches and Pains.
The Battery has a soothing effect upon children
while teething. Illustrated Circular sent free, giving
