FOR YOUNG CORNSTALKS!
MARK ROY has a special regard for the lithe, sinewy, native-born lads of Australia. In a few years’ time it will be to them
we must look for the men to uphold our fame in cricket, football, rowing, sailing, and the more serious vocations of life. If they are to
grow up “sound in wind and limb,” they must be well-clad—well protected against the sudden changes'of the Australian climate.

COUGHS, GOLDS ON THE OHBST, BRON-
OHITfs AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’n Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“We, the undersigned, have had occasion to
obtain
HEARNE’S BRONCHITIS CURE,
and we certify that it is perfectly and rapidly suc-
cessful under circumstances which undoubtedly
prove its distinct healing power.” Signed by
Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong,
and 59 other leading residents.
“Mr. W. 6. Hearne,
“ Dear Sir, —Some months ago my little boy got
very ill with bronchitis. My wife heard of your
Bronchitis Cure and got a bottle of it. The first
dose eased him, and less than half the bottle com-
pletely cured him. We always keep it in the
house now. I persuaded a friend of mine to try
it; he did so, and it was just as successful with
his children. You are at liberty to make what
use you like of this, as I consider your Bronchitis
Cure to be a boon that cannot be too widely
known : in fact, I cannot speak too highly of it.
—Yours very truly, ARTHUR G. JAMES,
Golden Square, Bendigo.
“Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure in informing
you that my father has been improving ever since
he started taking your Bronchitis Cure, and now
all signs of bronchitis have disappeared.— Yours
respectfully, THOS. PAYNE, Junr., Bloomfield,
Everton.”
“Will Mr. Hearne please send a bottle of his
Bronchitis Cure ? I had one two or three months
ago which effected a speedy cure. —J. WYATT,
Newtown, Geelong.”
“Dear Sir,—l had occasion to use your Bron-
chitis Cure, and have been completely cured by
it.—Yours faithfully, J. H. WILLIAMS, Merles-
wood, Elsternwick.”

O XJRSBLVBS!
We wish it to be understood that the character of the
business we do, and the absolutely inclusive variety of the
goods we sell, entitle us to be called
UNIVERSAL PROVIDERS.
We are also not far out, considering the low prices we
ask for everything we sell, and the consequent blessings
we are continually showering upon the people, when we
assert, not in timorous tones, but with the trumpet voice
of confidence in the truth of what we say, when we dub
ourselves
PUBLIC BENEFACTORS.
There are good men in every sphere of life—honest
citizens in every community, whose deeds stamp them
for the approval of their fellow-men, and single them out
from tlie common herd. Thus we find among the crowd
who aspire to serve their country on the benches of the
Legislative Assembly a patriot here and there who stands
out in bold relief against the. inajbrity, whose sole aim
is place and pay. And in commercial life the same thing
occurs, and the same strong contrast between the few
disinterested friends of the people, and the many selfish
lookers after the big profits they would like to make, is
plainly apparent. To the former class, to the little band
of merchants who study their customers’ interests, and
who, in self-abnegation and contentedness, are willing to
accept small profits in reward for their services, belong
ANTHONY HORDERN’S.
They say that a good action is its own reward, hutif the
good action entail hard work, much tribulation, and con-
tinual strife, then surely the laborer is worthy of his hire,
and the doer of good actions entitled to some recompense
at the hands of those who profit by what he does.
ANTHONY HORDERN’S
nevercease from their toil ; in the burden and heat of the
noonday sun they work, oppress' d by the cruel frost of
gomewhile baffled efforts and frustrated negotiations, they
continue, knowing always that the approval of millions of
souls is theirs. For three-quarters of a century it. has
been so, and for a longer time than that it will remain as
it has been. Generations passed away have bought from
the great house, and generations yet to come will do the
same. Like the practice of honesty or truth, there is a
policy in it which brings to its adherents
PROFIT AND SATISFACTION.

Shapely nails, an unblemished skin, and luxuriant
hair are produced by the Cuticura Reme-
dies when all others and the best skin doctors
fail. In the treatment of the simplest forms of facial
blemishes, or the severest humors and diseases of the
skin and scalp, with loss of hair, even when complicated
with hereditary or scrofulous taints, they are equally suc-
cessful. Everything about them invites confidence. They
are absolutely pure, and may be used on the youngest
infant. They are agreeable to the most refined and sen-
sitive. They are speedy, economical, and unfailing.
CUTICURA
Remedies afford instant relief in the most
distressing of itching, burning, and scaly skin
diseases. They cleanse the scalp of dandruff,
scales, and crusts, cure itching humors, destroy
microscopic insects which feed on the hair, and
supply the roots with energy and nourishment. They
restore the pores to healthy action, and thus remove
the cause of pimples, blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin.
They heal rough,'chapped, and fissured hands, with itching palms
and painful finger ends, and remove the cause of shapeless nails.

A GOLDEN SHANTY.’
In the Dead Letter Office.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Come, rip the mail-bags open, chaps, and sort the
stuff away;
A thumping mail again from Perth —we’ll have
some work to-day.
Two thousand unclaimed letters here, if there’s a
single one;
So bustle round the tables, boys, and get the sort-
ing done
That we may have them opened up and let the
senders know
The reason why there’s no reply come back from
“ Westward, Ho 1 ”
Eor wives have husbands over there, and girls
their sweethearts, too,
And soils who found the old land hard sought
fortune in the new ;
And some died in the hospitals, who nameless
there have lain,
And some lie dead where no man knows upon the
scorching plain,
And some have glared on blazing skies and cruel
desert sands
Till reeling brain and bursting heart they stilled
with desp’rate hands,
And timid men stay near the towns, but some in
quest of gold
Have wandered from the mailman’s track : no
letters reach the bold.
Then stir yourselves and toss them out; for some
are on the rack
These three months past with sorrowing when no
reply came back ;
A gleam of hope to many send who mourn their
loved to-day,
For oft the envelopes are marked “Unclaimed,”
or “ Gone Away,”
But some have scored across the face the mournful
legend, “Dead,”
Or “ Died in Hospital ” —Ah me! sad missives
never read.
The daring heart that crossed the sea to win his
dear ones bread,
Had perished ’neath the fever-pang, no friend
beside his bed ;
And hardly had his sunken eyes filmed in ap-
proaching death,
And still his frame seemed quivering with one last
sobbing breath,
When from his wife the letter came so full of
loving cheer:
“ I’m longing for your safe return ; God bless and
keep you, dear !
The children all are well and strong—they send
their love to you,
Wo manage just to get along, but one week’s rent
is due,
And that can wait, the landlord says—he’s better
than we thought;
He thinks, perhaps, you’ll strike the gold ; there’s
plenty there ; you ought. ”
Ah, well ! such tales are common now, they’re
multiplying fast—
Ah ! that lazy fourth-class man is working hard
at last !
He’s crusty and cantankerous, and selfish as can
be,
He growls and grumbles all the day, and little
work does he ;
His ton<rue is always on the nag; but since the
goldfields’ mail
Comes once a month from Albany with many a
mournful tale,
He’s seized with a desire to show a heart he does
not lack,
And grafts away with might and main to send the
letters back.
The junior clerks are waiting fast, their pen-nibs
fairly fly
The usual chatt’ring is not heard, and little wonder
why—
When sending back to some poor girl the tender,
loving note
That never met the eyes of him for whose dear
sake she wrote;
And right across the envelope a legend, scrawled in
red,
Tells how, while she poured forth her heart the
youth lay stark and dead.
Alas for those unfortunates whose hopes are in the
West,
With husbands, fathers, toiling there for gold in
fierce unrest !
For fever, drought, and pestilence will reap a
harvest grand—
The stoutest hearts Australia owns throb in that
deadly land:
So, when you pass our office by, and hear no noisy
din,
You’ll maybe murmur with a sigh, “ The Perth
Dead Mail is in.”

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “ Cameo ” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. I,’’have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New Snuth Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THREE CASTLES ” and “C AA IPS TAA ZEST.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the interest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise

SATURDAY, JUNE 1, 1895.
The Hour and the Alleged Man.
The N.S. W. Ministry got through the motion
of censure by a huge majority, and The
Bulletin, for one, does not weep thereat.
The fall of Premier Reid would probably
have meant the return to power of Mr.
Henry Parkes, and the province has had
more than enough of that shifty politician for
this century. The spectacle of Parkes lead-
ing a Protectionist or semi-Protectionist
Government would doubtless have been
interesting and curious, after a fashion, but
the country is not collecting curiosities at
present. Moreover, the fall of Reid at the
present moment would have wrecked a most
interesting and valuable experiment in the
art of responsible government, which experi-
ment is even now going on beneath the eyes
of the nation while the nation is, apparently,
iu blank ignorance of the fact. The great
art and mystery of Government by Contra-
diction —the whole dreary, useless, stupid
policy of party administration, which has
been a burden on the Parliamentary system
since Australia first began is calmly
going to pieces. There has been no definite
crusade against it, save that which The
Bulletin has maintained for the past four
years or so. No party, or leader, or Govern-
ment has actually proposed its abolition. No
Parliament has openly or distinctly declared
that it has outlived its usefulness, if
it ever had any. It has simply began
to crumble away through the pressure of cir-
cumstances and the opportune weakness of an
excessively flabby Government, and if the
same Government remains in office a year or
two longer it may, by that time, be crumbled
beyond repair. The advent, just now, of a
strong Ministry which would set itself to re-
establish the old system would-be a calamity.
# • *
The reason why the Reid Ministry re-
mains in office with the support of a very
large majority is sufficiently simple : it is
hardly anybody’s interest to eject it. It is
not a prohibition or a local-option Ministry,
but the Premier has virtually promised that,
though it will not commit itself so far as to
deal with the subject, it will not oppose, or
rouse up its party to oppose, any measure
that may be introduced on the subject.
Therefore, there is no possible reason why
the Cold Tea faction should object to the
present Cabinet, which promises about as
much as it could possibly expect. There is
also no reason why the liquor interest should
object to it, seeing that it is not opposed to
that crowd either ; it simply promises to
stand aside, with the bottle in its hand, and
let the tea and beer parties fight to a finish.
The Protectionists object to it from force of
habit, but there is now no special reason
why they should do so very strongly. The
Government has lately made the fact
generally understood that it doesn’t propose
to stake its existence on the tariff, any more
than it did on the Local Government question;
the Customs Duties Bill will be laid on the
table, and if, in the general worry and ear-
chewing which ensues, the Protectionists get
uppermost on some important points, the
matter will be taken philosophically. If the
sugar and grain duties and a few ocher im-
posts can be saved out of the wreck the
Ministry does not propose—at all events, not
at present—to resign or dissolve Parliament
over the matter ; it is, so far as its sympa-
thies go, a Freetrade Ministry, but if the
House directs it to run a partially Pro-
tectionist tariff it will cheerfully do so. The
Freetraders have an exactly similar prospect ;
the two parties are to wade in when the
battle comes, and get as much Freetrade or
as much Protection as they can, and no
Ministry could offer them any more. The
Single-taxers, the Labor representatives, and
members of every other shade of opinion
have the same free field open to them.
Every party is to sail in freely and carry
its point if it can. The Government may
not approve of the point, but if the House
expresses a definite opinion it will not—
unless, perhaps, in a very desperate case —
take an unfair advantage of its position by
seeking a dissolution and thus blocking, by
underhand means, the will of the Assembly.
Under these circumstances it is difficult to
find any reason—apart from its awful failure
in matters of finance—why any party should
seriously desire to eject the Reid Cabinet
just now. No other Government ever offered
a fair field to all parties, and gave every man
a run for his money, or his fad, or his prin-
ciple —the figure of speech is rather mixed,
but the idea is sufficiently understandable.
• * *
Under the old party system, the central
axiom was that Mr, H. Parkes or Mr. G.
Republican Dices should be “in power
that he should have a policy ; and that the
said policy should be crowded down the
throat of the Assembly whole. If the Assem-
bly objected to one notable item of his policy
it was his duty to resign in a lofty fashion,
or else to get a dissolution and stop public
business for three months, and put every-
body to great trouble, expense and anxiety.
If it threw out one of his bills, it was his
duty to do likewise. If it amended one of
his measures in any important particular, it
was again his duty to do likewise. If it
decided that he should do something to
which he was disinclined it was his duty to
do likewise some more. It was his duty to
live in a continual attitude of haughty dis-
dain expressive of the fact that he didn’t
want “hoffis,” and the worst hinsult which
could be levelled at him was the haccusation
of wanting “hoffis.” Under these circum-
stances, the Assembly, which is supposed to
be the great governing authority of the
country, could not originate anything of
importance, or amend anything, or reject
anything ; it could not select from the
Ministerial programme the features of which
it approved and discard those of which it
disapproved ; and it was constantly bull-
dozed into acting against its principles by the
threat that it would be sent to the country—
in which case a good many of its members
would probably lose their seats; or else that
the reins of power would be handed over to
the equally unmanageable autocrat on the
other side of the House. Under these con-
ditions, Parliamentary government naturally
became a mockery. The lofty attitude of a
Ministry which didn’t want “hoffis” took
all power out of the hands of the people’s
representatives, save the power of deciding
which of the two unmanageable autocrats
should “ run the show.”
* * *
The policy of Government by Contradic-
AVon naturally involved the division of the
tissembly into two parties, one of which
Aould always support the Cabinet whether it
was wrong or not. But the advent in New
wouth Wales of a third party which started
Sibh certain fixed principles, and offered to
support whichever autocrat would adopt its
principles, or whichever one would adopt
more of them than the other, and to support
him just as long as he followed its ideas, shook
the old system to its foundations. A party
which would vote for Parkes or Dibbs or
Reid, or the Prince of Darkness, so far as
he adhered to its programme, and on all
matters not mentioned in its programme
would go to pieces and vote anyhow it
pleased, made Party Government almost im-
possible. Nobody could count on a certain
majority whether he was right or wrong.
The simple and beautiful logic by which one-
half, or thereabouts, of the Assembly always
voted for the Government, and the other
half, or thereabouts, always voted against it,
and neither section ever thought for itself
except ou private members’ night, or on very
extreme occasions, fall into chaos. Two
Ministries went to pieces in the effort to
adhere to the foolish and superannuated
traditions of the past, and then a peaceful,
spineless, tea-party kind of Cabinet came
into office with a great flourish of crumpets,
and unconsciously adapted itself to the situa-
tion.
• * *
The unwritten agreement which has ap-
parently been arrived at between the present
N.S. W. Government and the Legslature is
somewhat as follows : (1) That the Assembly
is, in reality as well as in name, the principal
governing power of the country ; (2) that it
has the right to amend or reject Government
measures, and to initiate, on a much wider
scale than heretofore, measures not included
in the Government programme, without
being interrupted or terrorised by the re-
signation of the Cabinet or the dissolution
of Parliament, or by threats of resignation
or dissolution ; (3) that the Government will
hold office until the expiration of Parliament,
or until it is dismissed by a direct vote of
censure ; (4) that the Action according to
which the Government doesn’t want “hoffis”
shall be buried in peaceful oblivion,
it being recognised that every separate
member wants office just about as badly
as he can, and that there is no disgrace
in wanting it, or in having it, and that there
is no special merit in resigning it. The only
occasion on which the Reid Government
seriously departed from this agreement was
when it withdrew the Local Government Bill
because the Assembly reduced the maximum
property suffrage from twenty votes to five,
but there is no visible sign that it is likely to
commit another such act of folly. A short
time ago The Bulletin expressed the
opinion that the Reid Government should be
kept in alleged power that it might serve as
a horrible example of the- results of its own
tariff, and thus settle the fiscal question once
for all. At that period it was still believed
that the Cabinet proposed to stake its exist-
ence on the Customs Bill and stand or fall
by it, but since then it has come to be
generally understood that it will not stake
its existence either on that or any other
measure, but will leave the tariff question
also to the discretion of the House. In that
case, the Reid Ministry will not serve as a
horrible example of Freetrade, or of any-
thing else in particular, and The Bulletin
no longer desires to keep it in office for any
such purpose. But it hopes that it will
remain on the Treasury benches until the
Legislature has so far settled down to the
new order of things that it will not tolerate
a return to the autocratic, cast-iron routine of
Government by Contradiction.
« # #
If the Legislature does get time and oppor-
tunity to assimilate the new conditions, then
it will presently assert its right, not only to
direct the Cabinet, but also to create it, and
the election of Ministers for a fixed period
will, take the place of the present purposeless
and haphazard system of appointment. It
is a matter for regret that this great and
urgent reform was not brought about de-
finitely and directly, by a strong Ministry,
which would establish the system by legis-
lative enactment ; instead of being gradually
arrived at—or rather beginning to be gradu-
ally approached—by the feeble incapacity of
a weak one which drifts, like a straw on a
current, with no definite idea where it
is going, and no serious desire to go
anywhere in particular. But meanwhile
the drift is in the right direction, and
that is the principal consideration. Pos-
sibly the Assembly is itself not suffi-
ciently decided on the matter to arrive at its
destination otherwise than by a policy of
drift. Meanwhile, The Bulletin hopes—
for the fourth time or thereabouts—that the
Reid Government ■ will remain where it
nominally is as long as it is prepared to obey
in detail the will of the country as repre-
sented by Assembly majorities. A moder-
ately strong Premier might find time, even
now, to get back to the old system ; at all
events, he would almost certainly make a
great attempt to do so. The present Premier
is too weak to get back, or even to seri-
ously attempt getting back. He is the only
man at present in sight who is quite
weak enough to suit the emergency, and
by retaining his portfolio, and peacefully
drawing his salary, and allowing the situa-
tion to work itself out until some definite
result is arrived at, he will do more good
than anybody has hitherto expected from
him. Even the unspeakable blundering of his
financial devices is no reason why he should
be removed ; it is only a reason why the
House should insist on putting his finances
straight, and should beseech him to remain
where he is till further notice.
Things as They Are.
The Bulletin has received this letter :
Editor Bulletin. —Readers are now deluged with
columns of twaddle about the appreciation of gold and
the depreciation of silver. Shortly, the facts are that
gold is dear because it is scarce ; silver cheap because it
is plentiful, and is reaching its real value as an article of
utility. If a mine were discovered to-morrow that could
turn out gold as Broken Hill does silver we should hear a
howl from the gold people about the appreciation of
silver. The use of one, two, three, or a dozen metals as a
medium of exchange is an absurd survival of the primitive
days when jewellery and precious stones were so utilised.
An oz. of gold is worth, say, £4 ; an oz. of silver, 2s. 6d.;
because they represent so much labor expended in their
production. Their intrinsic value his nothing to
do with it: that value probably approximates to
that of aluminium, copper, and tin ; and will
be found directly they are abandoned as tokens
of labor. So far as they are not used in the
arts, their production is a sheer waste of brain and
muscle. A, we will say, has £1 worth of wheat, which he
wishes to exchange with B, who has £1 worth of bacon.
Does he do so ? No. A goes to C, who has expended £1
worth of labor in finding gold. A takes O’s gold for his
wheat, and with the gold buys A’s bacon. Then B goes
to 0 and buys the wheat he wants. This statement leaves
out of account the inevitable middleman who makes his
pickings out of A, B and 0, and shows simply the position
of the producers. Evidently O's labor is wasted his
product neither fattens nor cloth* s anybody, nor is it a
brain-food like a work of art. If A could taka his
wheat and get a Government note, stating that he
had deposited £1 worth of labor, said note being
payable on demand in labor products, he could
give it to B, or anyone else whose goods he
wanted. For that note would have a better basis of
value than our present currency, and would stand for AX
worth of useful, and not fancy, labor. The critics are
right when they say we should have a stable currency
with an ample reserve. They are right when they say a
printing-press cannot make money—but it can print
receipts for labor done, and a Bank of England note stands
for no more than that. A country with laborand resources
can create money just as f.-st as it creates products, only
limited by t he public demand for a medium of exchange ;
the so-called precious metals are as uncalled for and use-
less to producers and consumers alike, as the strings of
wampum and cowrie shells used by savages. If the
present metal folly had not been bolstered up try paper in
the shape of cheques, bills and bank drafts, it would
have gone to the limbo of obsolete customs generations
ago. It is pointed out that with a paper currency
gold coin would leave the country, but it is never
explained who would suffer thereby. At present
our English cieditors are paid in products, so they could
not complain. And as we neither eat, drink, wear nor
get mental pap out of sovereigns, it is hard to realise
where our loss would come in. A central Government
store prepared to give market-value in notes for all staple
products such as wheat, wool and tallow, would be the
safest bank in the world. Its losses on a falling would be
made up by its gains on a rising market, and all its notes
would have a tangible asset. In like manner a workman
might deposit his labor in a public work of utility and
receive a note in exchange, the railway cutting or water
dam standing for value received. This plan, however, has
one insuperable objection and is never mentioned in any
right-minded journal, for it leaves Fatman out.—H.F.

The Bulletin prints this, not because it
wants correspondence on the subject—Heaven
forbid ! —but because it puts such a bright,
new face on a lot of the dull, old sophistries
that have bamboozled countless generations of
superficial thinkers. There is just one little
item that sophists, new and old, always leave
out of their calculations, and that is Things As
They Are. If the world could be regenerated
as it is to be resurrected—“in a moment, in
the twinkling of an eye ” —the job would have
been done long ago. Unfortunately, the world
is a pigheaded old world, with a keen nose for
truffles and, for the most part, a singularly deal
ear for fine phrases, and it roots away quite
unregardful of the saviours who offer it a
thousand pair of wings at once. If only it
would fly !
* « *
“ H.F.’s ” central fallacy seems to be merely
a half-statement of Marx’s theory that the
value of anything depends upon its social labor-
cost —a theory which has been riddled by
argument over and over again, but which is
such a handy tool for millennium-makers that
its popularity remains unabated. Makx him-
self was anything but a millennium-maker. He
recognised the terrible solidity of Things As
They Are. Our social system is bad, he said
in effect; but we can do little to mend it.
Everything is a matter of evolution : we must
go step by step, add line upon line. As for
abolishing by mere effort of will, or law of Par-
liament or Congress, any habit, any system,
which the centuries have slowly welded into
the fabric of Things As They Are, you might as
well talk of abolishing earthquakes and vol-
canoes. But, as usual, the zeal of the disciples
outruns the wisdom of the master.
• * •
“H.F.” proposes to abolish money in the
ordinary sense, and as money forms an essen-
tial part of Things As They Are, it follows
from the doctrine laid down that the abolition—
i.e., the immediate abolition—is impossible.
The use of metal currency has become a social
habit, and all the governmental authorities in
the world couldn’t suddenly end it. People
don’t care for Acts of Parliament in these
matters—their prejudices in favor of the old
stocking and the hoard under the mattress are
engrained in them. Legally demonetise gold
to-morrow morning, and it will still be king of
the money-market to-morrow night, and prob-
ably with increased power. If all the govern-
ments of the world could not abolish money,
still less could Australia, or any province of
Australia (“H.F.” does not say where he would
begin) do so. One trouble with the attractive
dream of a universal and exclusive paper cur-
rency is that no country likes to take the first
leap—for it would assuredly be over a precipice.
* • #
If this is not clear A priori , probably no
amount of argument would make it so. We
may build beautiful air-castles in theory ; but
in practice every one of us is guided by a very
wholesome reverence for Things As They Are.
For example, Russia is said to have a war-hoard
of about 100 millions in gold, and Germany
and France have similar reserves. These are
three strong nations ; but they cannot afford to
trust wholly to Government credit. Even the
British Government, probably the strongest of
all commercially, relies to some extent upon the
bullion reset've in the Bank of England, and
whenever there are signs of an undue drain
of gold the Bank rate of exchange is raised
in order to prevent it. Like the rest of
us, they must take into account the world’s
convention —the tacit agreement which subsists
in defiance of all splutterings and dreamings,
and which every nation and every individual
disregards at personal peril.
* * *
Thus a paper currency can never have more
than limited use while present conditions sub-
sist. Its value rests entirely upon the general
confidence that it will be, or can be, re-
deemed in gold. It was that confidence
which sustained the paper currencies issued by
Federals and Confederates during the American
Civil war. The value of “greenbacks” and
“ greybacks ” rose or fell as the tide of battle
turned one way or the other. The Federals
won; “greenbacks” became an undisputed
national currency and rose to par; “grey-
backs” were waste paper. But if, at any time
during the struggle, either side had notified
that its promises to pay were, and would be,
irredeemable in metal currency, their value as
an exchangeable medium would certainly have
fallen to nil at once. Or, if the American
Government now notified that its “ green-
backs ” would not be redeemed in metal cur-
rency on demand, their value—supposing that
any Government was foolish enough to issue
such a notice, and that the people was foolish
enough to support it—would again fall to
nothing, or almost nothing. Why ? Because a


great community like the United States will
not and cannot disregard Things As They Are.
• # •
It is impossible to deal fully with “H.F.s”
statements in a single article: those who believe
them can only he counselled to read and reflect
till they grow wiser. But it may he said, in
conclusion, that the phrase “intrinsic value,”
as applied to gold and silver, is meaning-
less because that value, apart from the con-
ventional standard, is unascertainahle ; that
the only practical criterion of gold and silver
value is use-value, in which currency-use-value
must be included ; that, similarly, the value of
anything else is its use-value—not tire value of
the labor expended in producing it, but its
value in open market; that the middleman is
not wholly useless, the fact that he exists being
proof that he supplies a need—the man who
brings fish or bread to the consumer, for ex-
ample, Being just as much a “ producer ” as the
fisherman or the baker; that, consequently, tire
measure of the value of anything to tire com-
munity being use value and not labor-value,
the community cannot profitably under-
take to purchase useless articles at the
value of the labor expended in producing
• them ; that products are perishable, while State
promises to-pay would he permanent—conse-
quently tire State which undertook to pay for
all products would go bankrupt, or else the
value of its labor-notes would fall to zero, see-
ing it could not possibly satisfy, for example,
the demand upon its perishable stores made by
accumulated paper-savings ; that, if an incon-
vertible paper currency did succeed in driving
a gold currency out of, say, Australia, the
workman who got his wages in that hound-to-
he-heavily-fluctuating currency would he the
first to suffer ; that, in fact, “ H.E.’s ” scheme
would spell ruin to any modern community
excent, perhaps, a self-contained village com-
munity ; and that The Bulletin hopes,
having read so far, the “H.F.’s” of Australia
are a trifle nearer understanding this.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
More War Scare.
That fine old Tory paper, the Wellington
(M.L.) Post, shrieks on behalf of the Chinaman
and the Jap. and the cheap nigger, and the
cause of piebaldism generally
Japan, by the terms it has imposed upon China of open-
ing the country enterprise, has set a noble
example. It is one which these colonies will have to fol-
low. If they are wise they will do so voluntarily. If
mey do not do it voluntarily they will be compelled to do
if. They will not, any more than China, be allowed to
hedge their shores round with restrictions on free inter-
course with other nations, Asiatic or European, nor will
a iy little colony like New Zealand be permitted to erect
a ring-wall around it with a Minister of Labor, like
another St. Peter, holding the keys at the gate, to deter-
mine who shall or shall not be allowed to enter. Japan,
which has compelled China to open her gates, will not
long suffer the colonies to close theirs to her enterprise,
or her people, or her allies. England will owe too much
to Japan, and benefit too much from access to
China, to afford any support to the colonies
in maintaining a policy of selfish isolation, or
by means of Undesirable Immigrants Acts excluding from
iheir shores all of alien blood. We are not at all afraid of
a Mongolian or Asiatic invasion. There is not the slightest
fear of this colony ever being flooded by hordes of
Japanese or Chinese. A certain proportion of those races
will no doubt find a settlement here, and it will be im-
possible to prevent them, if it were desirable to do so,
which is a matter for argument. That we shall be long
permitted to legislate to absolutely exclude them, or
to impose prohibitory restrictions upon them, we do not
believe. We have much more to gain from being afforded
free access to their countries than we have to fear from
affording them access to ours. We have very little
patience, and no sympathy, with the doctrine preached
ny the Minister of Labor, and embodied in the Undesir-
able Immigrants Bill, as to the exclusion from the colony
of anyone who is able and anxious to make an honest
living in it. That we should protect ourselves against an
influx of criminals, or of persons likely to become a
public burthen, is just and fair; but what moral right
have the handful of people who have taken possession of
the land of the Maori to attempt to exclude others from
the benefits of occupation when there is room enough for
all? It is a narrow-minded, intensely selfish, and most
shortsighted policy which Mr. Reeves and his sympathisers
preach. It is a policy of which the war just closed has
sounded the death-knell. The colonies will not be per-
mitted to pursue a line of policy or assert all exclusiveness
which China has been forced by arms to abandon. Japan
will demand full rights of access for herself, and probably
for China also, to the British colonies. Great Britain will
not gainsay the right, and the colonies themseli es will be
powerless to refuse it.
And yet Australia and Maoriland will probably
go on doing their best, in their poor, weak,
short-sighted way, to keep out the Chow and
the Jap, being urged thereto by the awful
examples of North Queensland, and the
Northern Territory, and sundry of the South
Sea islands, where somehow or other the piebald
races have “flooded” the country, and are fast
starving out the white and other former inhabi-
tants. And, meanwhile, China, after all, is to go
on hedging herself round with old “ restric-
tions,” for all that the Japanese have really
gained seems to he the opening of a few more
ports, and the great bulk of the country is to
remain as before. And, instead of Japan com-
pelling Britain to throw open the empire to the
hordes of the little brown men, she is being
steadily deprived of the fruits of her vic-
tories by the pressure of the European Powers,
and is in serious danger from Russia ami
several other aggressive states. Also, China
and Japan are as far from being “allies” as
ever—perhaps a good deal further, being simply
in the position of Prance and Germany after
1871; and the fact that the Maorilanders have un-
justly jumped the Maori’s laud doesn’t affect the
case in the least, seeing that almost every nation
with a visible history is living in a land which
it jumped from some unlucky predecessor;
and England isn’t likely to “ owe ” anything in
particular to either China or Japan, except that
the latter power bids fair to become a very dan-
gerous commercial rival and to damage her
trade badly in the East. Besides, if she did
owe anything she would most likely not pay it,
for there is no gratitude in commerce ; and, in
any case, the war hasn’t sounded any especial
“ death-knell,” for it never amounted to
more than a little fight on China’s remotest out-
skirts ; and when the whole business is viewed
calmly, without any scare, or delirium, or
literary convulsions, nothing particular has
happened after all, save that Japan Ins
brought down on herself the susp ; a
of several great nations which formerly
were hardly aware of her existence, and
is consequently in more danger than she
was ever in before. Taking a cairn review
of the whole situation, The Bulletin’s opinion
is that Australasia is the worst-scared country
going; that the Wellington Post is the most
childishly scared paper in it; and that, apart
from its scare, it is willing—in theory, that is
—to sell its country to any Asiatic who wants
it, merely for the sake of getting square with
the Seddon Ministry, which seems to disagree
with its archimedean liver, somehow. Pro-
bably, though, it is a good enough patriot in
practice, and merely conducts itself like this by
way of taking a little exercise on an empty
stomach.
Costs.
The Victorian Full Court lately granted a new
trial in the Alert case, with costs against the
unfortunate woman who won a verdict some
few months ago. The Alert foundered in a gale
off Port Phillip Heads, and all hands, save
one, were drowned. Mrs. Kilpatrick, widow
of the second engineer, sued Huddart, Parker
& Co. for damages, alleging that they had not
taken every reasonable means to ensure the sea-
worthiness of their vessel, her complaint being
bracketed, so to speak, with a suggestion that
the said Alert, having little margin of sea-
worthiness to spare, stood always in need of
special precautions against accident. The case
was tried by Judge Williams and a jury of 12,
and Mrs. Kilpatrick was awarded ,£6OO
damages. Judge Williams explained his view
of the law concerning ship-owners’ responsi-
bility, and analysed the evidence, and
did his best, no doubt, to procure
a fair, honest expression of intelligent
opinion from the jurymen. Messrs. Huddart,
Parker and Co. availed themselves of the law
of appeal—which is the birthright of Capital,
and will remain its birthright until the people
arise and kick. The Full Court set aside the
verdict of Justice Williams’ jury. Widow
Kilpatrick asked for justice, and thought she
had got it in the form of £6OO damages. Had
she lost the case, she didn’t possess the money-
power to appeal—but this is, in legal eyes, an
irrelevant detail. The Full Court finds that
the outcome of a long trial was not
justice, nor law, nor anything except Costs.
Justice Madden and his two colleagues ruled
that “ the jury had never considered the case
in its true legal aspect.” Nobody knows the
Law, say the lawyers, nevertheless the true
aspect of the thing they can’t swear to
is easily recognised. This by the way.
Perhaps the jurymen who gave damages to the
engineer’s widow were all wrong, according to
the Act. If so, Judge Williams, their ad-
viser, should have told them that no vessel cer-
tificated by the Marine Board, and floating
comfortably on the water, can be called unsea-
worthy. The lack of proper fastenings to a
pantry window may be of grave consequence
when the vessel gets on her beam ends, “but
this defect would not be obviously dangerous,”
in the ordinary way, and seaworthiness is esti-
mated in quite an ordinary way, says the Full
Court. Judge Williams, by this showing,
should have directed the jury to find for the
defendant, but the Full Court made no refer-
ence to him. Common-sense asks why
Justice Williams allowed an obviously
absurd verdict to pass. And if he couldn’t
squelch it on the spot, why couldn’t he, seeing
that one Judge is, or ought to be, as good as
the rest of them ? And if it wasn’t absurd —
but the list of questions that suggest themselves
is appalling. The answer is Costs. An appeal
to a higher court is an accusation of injus-
tice, or ignorance, or dense stupidity against
the lower court. The setting aside of a
jury’s verdict, on the ground that they “ never
considered the case in its true legal aspect ” is
an assertion that the Judge didn’t present it to
them in a proper way. When the world
troubles to consider the legal aspect of these
appeals it will suddenly observe that the Law
invites contempt, purely for the sake of Costs.
Greed is God.
A Melbourne “Reform” Club apostle on
Socialism
The cry that the State should own all capital and land
was a dangerous one. The great idea of life was love of
gain, and the State would never he able to destroy the
preciousness of gold.
The great idea of life is the love of gain
Greed is God
Greed is God, and high enthroned sits he in
his might,
Robbery his left hand is, and Cruelty his
right ;
About his feet ten thousand dying wretches
writhe and moan.
And ten dozen kneel in worship, bowed before
his golden throne.
He hath men and babes for sacrifice a million
million told,
And he stills their veins’ red juices into drops
of yellow gold,
And he wrings the souls of women, and his
taloned fingers ply
At their heart-strings till they sunder and the
tortured victims die.
But the few who have his favor, they who hold
. his bloody creed,
Are his precious care for ever ; in his breath
they live and breed,
And the flesh from oil' the pil£d hones that taint
the flowing air
Is the dainties on their tables and the gauds
their women wear.
Greed is God ! no Christ was given, and the
highest human aim
Is a loathly.act of worship, Pity nothing but a
name.
God is Greed ! the hope we cherish is a sour,
delusive imp—
Man is destined from his birth to be a victim or
a pimp.
EDWARD DYSON.
The Bulletin wants to point out, in the in-
terests of frozen reason, that, so far, it has not
been proved that Mrs. Dean was ever poisoned
at all. Her mother and herself say that she
was vomiting and purging (as if from the
effects of arsenic), but as tiie doctor admittedly
never saw her in that condition, so far as lie is
concerned the case is one of the merest hearsay.
As to the alleged strychnine-poisoning, no one
ever saw her in strychnine-convulsions ; there-
fore there is no proof that she ever took strych-
nine. As to the arsenic found in the excretions
—well, it would be easy to add arsenic to
excretions; and if the case happened to be the
result of a conspiracy, it would not be un-
fair to assume that those concerned in fasten-
ing the crime upon Dean had taken the
trouble to make a study of the business
in hand. Further, as to the reported symptoms
of paralysis in Mrs. Dean, allegedly arising
from arsenious poisoning, there is no conclusive
proof so far that they did not arise from one of
fifty other causes; and there is the fact that
the baby nourished by Mrs. Dean did
not exhibit any symptoms of arsenical
mischief. One of the doctors who diag-
nosed the woman’s case as arsenical paraly-
sis is, it must be remembered, the man who
originally formed the theory that she had been
dosed with that poison : Post hoc eryo propter
hoc. Nor is the matter settled by Judge Win-
deyer’s clairvoyant declaration that he is as
sure that she was poisoned on five different
occasions and that Dean was the person who
poisoned her as if he (Judge Windeyer) had
seen him doing it. So far as legal proof goes, it
is not more certain that Mrs. Dean was poisoned
by arsenic than that the Fmiperor of China is
identical with John Davies or the lately-
deceased “ Paddy the Ram.”
The S.M. Herald discourses on blood and
other subjects :
If this Governmental recognition of the new system of
trial by public meeting prove by its future results to have
very detrimental consequences on the firm and impartial
administration of justice, it is perhaps fair to say that
the blame for such result would have to be divided
between the Ministry who yielded to clamor against its
belter judgment, and the public which allowed itself to
be carried away by sentiment, and influenced by agitators
to such a degree as to bring to bear a pressure which,
perhaps, no Ministry could resist.
This primitive style of reasoning is built on two
assumptions, each one of which is incapable of
proof: (1) That the Dean trial was absolutely
impartial, and, therefore, that the public meet-
ings were held to upset its beautiful impar-
tiality ; (2) that every other trial would, but
for these meetings, have been absolutely impar-
tial, and that if the public agitation in Dean’s
case has any effect on the administration of
justice in general it must be by making it
become crooked and corrupt. Assuming these
two unproved circumstances, the rest of the
theory is sufficiently logical, and if The Bul-
letin started with the assumption that the
amiable proprietary of the Herald were
secretly addicted to cannibalism it could build
up therefrom a startling theory which would
be quite as logical. But, then, sound logic
doesn’t assume things in this reckless fashion.
The Sydney daily papers committed contempt
of justice in printing apparently - inspired
articles concerning the claims made on the New
South Wales Railway Commissioners re the
Redfern railway-smash. For instance, S.M.
Herald said :
In one or two oases in which a reasonable amount was
claimed, the compensation was paid over on the day upon
which the claim was received.
The word “reasonable” herein, no doubt,
meaning very small, and the direct insinuation
being that the unsettled claims were all out-
rageous. In the Herald it is stated that the
claims on account of fireman Orr (killed) and
driver Pearce (killed) have been “settled” for
,£469 10s. and .£670, respectively. The Bul-
letin presumes that the word “settled” is
here misleading, inasmuch as the settlements in
question were not voluntary, the amounts
named being apparently those to which, under
certain cast-iron departmental regulations to
which the drivers had to subscribe ere being
employed, their widows or other representa-
tives were entitled. In any case, the depend-
ants of those men killed in the service of the
State have been ground pretty fine in the official
mill. The widow of the highly-skilled and
well-paid workman (loco, drivers get, say, ,£5 a
week) who receives .£670 to recoup her for
the loss of her bread-winner, is making so poor
a bargain that it may be fairly asked whether,
under the circumstances, the State is not taking
a mean advantage of her helplessness. A jury
would certainly have given such a widow a
thousand or two sterling.

Strychnine is the only thing to meet such a case as his.

The down-trodden Irish patriot is on view
at Her Majesty’s (Sydney), where a revised and
partially-improved version of “Shamus O’Brien ”
is on the boards. Shamus is a brilliant stage
rebel who is vaguely understood to have done
deeds of enormous valor before the play began,
but during the time he is visible to the audience
he does nothing in particular. Also, he tells the
wicked officer in the red coat with the disgrace-
fully brief tail that he has never killed anybody,
and a rebel who never kills anybody is of small
account. But Shamus delivers speeches about
his bleeding country to bis sweetheart, to his
mother, to the priest, and the informer, and the
Saxon in the coat with the disreputably curt
tail, and the hangman, and 'the noble-hearted
English baronet, and many others, and is evi-
dently prepared to talk to a finish with the bare
jaw ou this subject, if need be. The new Shamus
is Mr. Charles Erin Verner, “the greatest Irish
comedian of the age,” an individual who is cer-
tainly great in one respect, for his legs shake to a
greater extent than those of any other Irish
comedian known to this paper. At one time,
indeed, there seemed reason to fear that he might
shake himself to death by the legs before the
proper time for his execution. Otherwise, the
greatest Irish comedian is a person with
a rather fine presence, a respectable brogue,
and an uneven delivery, and though he often
rises to the occasion he sometimes falls a consider-
able distance below it. Miss Agnes Knights
is chiefly remarkable for a loose, white dress and
much hair hanging down her back ; but Kate
Bishop, as the tragic mother of the voluble
patriot, is a noble-looking Irishwoman, and the
usually colorless Athena Claudius whoops joyfully
through' the drama as a wild Irish girl with the
prettiest brogue in Galway. For the rest, Frank
Harcourt is a raucous and ghoulsorae informer;
Scot Inglis makes a quietly-impressive baronet,
and J. W. Sweeney gets much nearer being the
greatest Irish comedian of the age than the
gorgeous Shamus. Likewise, the priest offers
spiritual consolation through his nose, and the
wicked officer, in the coat with the ridiculously
scanty tail, is represented in a somewhat wooden
fashion by Mr. Plimmer, who always looks so
exactly like himself that the resemblance is simply
marvellous. The painted scene in act 3, by the
way, is worth all the Irish drama on earth several
times over.

“ Ma Mie Rosette ” was revived on Satur-
day, at Sydney Lyceum, for a six nights’ run, and
a vast steaming multitude thronged the building.
Nellie Stewart, as aforetime, makes a winsome
Rosette, and her untutored innocence is signified in
the usual fashion by her brief skirt and the unpre-
tentious manner in which it hangs about her brown
ankles. Miss Nellie’s dreadful dream in Act 11.,
when she is hugged by the rakish king with the
bold, bad rolling eye, seems to go even a shade
more smoothly than heretofore, and this makes it
even a greater mystery why, when she wakes
again to the farmyard and the short frock in act
3, she should forego all these visionary glories,
and sack the bad king, and marry the good young
man who keeps pigs, and resolve to be poor and
happy ever afterwards. Mr. Brownlow, as the
bad but beautiful monarch, is such a picturesque
individual that the mystery gets worse every time
it is looked at. The Bulletin’s private opinion
is that Rosette thought better of it later on, and
that there was a horrible divorce-case, in which the
king wasco-respondent, and that the judge spoke
of that dissipated potentate in a most severe
fashion, and ordered him to pay all the costs, and
there was finally a great row over the alimony.
It has expressed this opinion before, and it now
repeats the statement with emphasis. Mr.
Brownlow’s King has developed into a most
beauteous potentate, and the magnificently-
bediamonded Miss Florence Young, as the bad
woman in the long frock—in contra-distinction
to the good woman in the short frock—is a
splendid advt. of the advantages of vice. Mr.
Tapley, as the moral rustic, is also an advt. to the
effect that the good young man shall remain poor,
and Miss Marietta Nash and Mr. Lauri serve as a
horrible warning to old maids and bogus dukes,
and the like. Altogether, vice has the best of it
all through, and virtue is left at the post, and then
falls over the first hurdle. For which reasons The
Bulletin loves “Ma Mie Rosette ” with a great
affection, and for a somewhat similar reason it
reveres “Mam’zelle Nitouche,” which is on the
biff for Saturday.
** * *
Still another revival of “Struck Oil”
probably the most revived play on this earth—is
doing well at Sydney Royal, where Miss Maggie
Moore’s farewell is making good progress. This
time, by the way, there seems to be reason for
supposing that Miss Moore is really leaving Aus-
tralia for good, and, if so, there is sufficient ex-
cuse for once more presenting the old story of
Lizzie Stofel to an admiring public—if the public
can stand it—for no one in these parts will ever
see that flaxen-haired German maiden again.
Other characters may come and go, but there is
only one Lizzie Stofel up to date, and Australia
will never take kindly to another ; so when Miss
Moore departs “ Struck Oil ” should be decently
buried, and anyone found fooling with its bones
should be talked to death by wild book-canvassers.
“Sweet Innisfail ” is to be produced, for the first
time in Australia, on Saturday.

On Friday (May 31) Harry Rickards gives
himself a big send-off at Sydney Tivoli, the pro-
gramme being made especially large and affecting
in honor of the occasion. During his absence it is
hoped that the audience will be kept up by hopes
of his early return. Meanwhile, Miss Millie
Herbert, “ Australia’s greatest contralto vocalist,”
has been engaged to till a gap. The Bulletin
thinks it remembers Miss Millie of old as a stout
lady who used to sing “O Save my Mother’s
Picture from the Sale,’ and it sincerely trust,
that she has sworn off that wailful ditty for good
If she hasn’t, this paper will be regretfully com-
pelled to put both feet through the aforesaid
picture.

Madame Emily Soldene’s benefit eventu-
ates at Sydney Lyceum next Wednesday after-
noon. A new concert and dramatic co., en-
gineered by these two well-known and popular
mummers, Harry Leston and George Buffer, is
chasing and overtaking the nimble shekel round
the Sydney suburbs. The Pacific Circus is pur-
suing its devasting career in Oastlereagh-street,
and a co. of blind musical students—three ladies
and four gentlemen—give the first of a series of
concerts at the School of Arts to-night (Thursday),
under vice-vice-regal patronage. Also, the Opera
House has been re-christened the Empire, and
York and Jones’ minstrels stiff hold the premises,
with the Permans as the principal attraction.
* « * *
The Rev. Haskett Smith, under the guid-
ance of R. S. Smythe, will give the first of hi s
series of lectures on Syria, Palestine, and Egypt
at Sydney Y. M.O. A. Hall on Monday. Mr*
Smith is reported by Mr. Smythe to be a lecturer
of great ability and thoroughly acquainted with
his subject, and as the great manager is no bad
authority on such subjects, Mr. Smythe’s report
on Mr. Smith is to be treated with some respect.
Anyhow, The Bulletin trusts that Mr. Smith
and Mr. Smythe will find the speculation mutually
profitable.
* * * *
A benefit, to come off at Sydney Royal
some time in June, is being organised for Mr.
W. J. Wilson—once of Majeroni and Wilson—the
well-known and deservedly popular theatrical
manager and scenic-artist. Mr. J. H. Rainford
is one of the movers in the matter, and among
others who have promised to co-operate are
Premier Reid and the rest of the Cabinet, Messrs.
Slattery, Barton, Humphrey, Greville, and Tric-
kett, Ms.P., Judge Simpson, Mr. Pilcher, Q. 0., and
about a score of other public characters. A pre-
liminary meeting will be held at the Australia
Hotel on the 31st at 4.15 p.m.

On Saturday the Gaiety Co. established a
claim to the courtesy title aforesaid by appearing
in “ The Shop Giri,” which is now running at
London Gaiety. If they travel under engage-
ment to the Gaiety manager and play a Gaiety
show they are a Gaiety Co., and The Bulletin
herewith sanctions the use of the designation in
question and overrules all captious objections to
the same. It is a convenient form of reference,
anyhow. “ The Shop Girl” is the third and last,
and by far the least satisfactory of the Gaiety Co.’s
achievements at Melb. Princess’s. Only one lady
improved her popularity on "Saturday—the dainty
Miss Decima Moore. She undertook the
name-part, which is quite rowdy and in-
coherent in comparison with the two characters
she had previously graced, therefore Melbourne
appreciated the little artist. If she were to faff
down a flight of stairs or sit upon something
pointed, the amphitheatre would probably give
her credit for being almost “as good as Lonnen.”
Among the men, Fred Kaye gathered a few more
laurels. In the first act he had chances to be
funny, and in the next he changed his costume
frequently and walloped a big drum. When he
walloped so hard that the ball flew off the drum-
stick, Mr. Kaye, at one bound, attained the pin-
nacle of fame. He was as good as Lonnen.
* * * *
“The Shop Girl” was written by a party
of the name of Dam. It is not worthy of him.
Dam’s dialogue is old and feeble, and very bald in
spots, and the spots are very frequent. Also,
some of Dam’s characters seem to have been cast
in a serious mould, for the probable reason that
the other moulds got broken before Dam was
throughlwith his task. Likewise, there aregrounds
for suspecting Dam of felonious intent to commit
a burlesque, every now and then. “The Shop
Girl ” is a weak-minded comedy in itself, but the
music, by Ivan Caryll and others, is pretty, and
crowded houses for the final week of a popular
season are a matter of course. Harry Monkhouse
has a heavy part to perform. If the lines were
smarter he would stiff be handicapped out of the
race by Maud Hobson’s fatal beauty. Monkhouse
is supposed to woo and win an ugly, brainless
country-bumpkin girl for the sake of her supposed
fortune. Miss Hobson, looking absurdly lovely,
is the woman called upon to make Monkhouse
shudder. The tall comedian can’t persuade an
audience that his situation is humorous, any more
than Maud can impersonate a female oaf. Louis
Bradfield is gay and brisk to a much smaller
extent than last time, whilst several other
favorites of the co. have less to do than four weari-
some men whose presence is not desired. No
matter. “ The Shop Girl ” is a good enough show
under the circumstances. The co. has earned a
reputation, and this is its positively last week
in Melb., and all the bookable seats have been
booked in advance.
** * *
A Brough-Boucicaulfc season opens at the
Princess’s on Saturday, and “The Case of Rebel-
lious Susan ” opens the season. The new B. and B.
pieces lately played in Sydney will follow in due
course. Also, “The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith ’’
is mentioned as a likely event. The coming of
B. and B. will give a much-needed shake-up to
Melbourne’s torpid intellect.

The Variety theatres are doing what they
did last week, or a little more so. The unparal-
leled Murphy and unapproachable Mack, from
New York, didn’t debut at the Opera House last
Saturday, but they will rectify their error by
appearing this Saturday. “ The Snowball ”is
the current farcical comedy at the Cambridge, and
the programme describes it as Sydney Grundy’s
work. Unhappily certain members of the Cam-
bridge Co. have a sassiety style of their own,
which makes the author a matter of very little
consequence. Grundy may have written some of
“ The Snowball ” produced at the Cambridge, but
he certainly forgot to teach the ladies how to
explain his meaning.
** * *
“The Span of Life ” has lasted seven weeks
at Melb. Royal, holding its own against Gaiety
co. opposition. Bland Holt’s next uprising of
scenery and effects will be “The Union Jack,’’
which presents itself on Saturday, with the inten-
tion of eclipsing the “Span,” if possible.

To-night (Thursday) and Saturday, the
Clifford-Hall 6 lectures on “ Singing as an Art ”
will be continued and concluded at the Athenseum
Hall. There are four lectures in the series, but
two of them will have happened ere this journal
issues itself.
At Poverty Point .
When Melb. Princess audience shrieked for repetitions
of the delirious dance between Madge Rosseil and Brad-
fleld, in the second act of “In Town,” it was blissfully un-
conscious of the fact that the gyrations “enthused”
over form the final and perhaps the naughtiest pas of the
great Can-can.
The Gaiety period has been noticeable for one thing •
there have been no floral offerings during the season
The custom of heaving cabbage bouquets at unoffending
artists has died out in Melbourne.
8.E.; “Opinions seem to differ vastly, but five weeks
of Gaiety Girldom have defined individual characteristics
beyond mistake. Maud Hobson is stately, the hand-
somest woman on the stage, and lisps. Blanche Massey
is lackadaisical, and pines plainly for a chance to die in
the snow to slow music. Florence Lloyd enacts severe
Melancholy in skirts, and only brightens up in “pants.”
Madge Rosseil is quicksilver and wickedness. Decima
Moore should have been born a sparrow, and has never
got over Nature’s mistake in making her a woman with
the instincts of a gamin. Grace Palotta is chic, witty for
a woman, and by far the cleverest of the bunch. There
is no Nellie Farren and no Fred Leslie in the co.
The Distressed Actors’ Fund (Melb.) distributed £574
during the past 12 months, in sums ranging from £5 to
£2O, granted in the lump, or by weekly instalments. The
expenses of distribution, “ petty cash and everything else
of the kind,” only amounted to £5 Bs., so the committee,
which has to hold a good many meetings, ordinary and
extraordinary, in the course of ayear, can’t make as much
as an official “ drink ” out of the job. Everybody works
aratis. It is understood that Tom Kennedy does the
private enquiring into distressful cases, and acts as
weekly almoner for the committee. He ought to have a
little benefit “on his own,” one of these days. There are
two or three honorary secretaries who get through a good
deal of shoe-leather on behalf of theatrical charities, but
T.K. seems to be the oldest-established secretary of them
all, and must have worn out the largest amount of boot.
Marie Elster, who got her bonnie brown hair off when
she saw it mis-stated that she was appearing in a Melb.

Mrs. Tree will play Kate Cloud in the revival of “John
k Dreams ”at London Haymarket. This, says Tub Bul-
letin's correspondent, is due to Haddon Chambers’ per-
suasion, for he was disappointed with Mrs. Pat. Campbell
in the part. Mrs. Pat. will, therefore, continue to draw
her £7O a week at the Garrick.
An amateur dramatic co. gave the tear-stained “East
Lvnne” down Brunswick (Vic.) way the other evening.
The local paper said it was a most enjoyable performance,
and “sent the house home in a good humor.” “East

“ Maud Hobson in tights is a horrible disappointment,”
writes “ Baldhead.” “ Her stately and well-gowned
presence in the first production raised delicious hopes of
statuesque limb-revelations later on. Her Hamlet cos-
tume in ‘ln Town ’ is complete disillusionment. The
bust is generous, but. those extremes—alas! Maud is
sadly conscious of the deficiency, and constantly avails
herself of an enshrouding mantle. The skirt is not yet
doomed.”
Melba writes on Grand Opera in the last Lippincott.

Dear Bulletin, —It is not a fact that there is invisible
wire in the Living Bridge act of Bland Holt’s hash-play.
The act is sufficiently dangerous to life and limb to call
for police intervention. Many far less risky have been
stopped before now. I have studied the modus operandi
at 2ft. distance during performance. The three acrobats
sit (they do not stand) on one another’s shoulders, with
the feet looked at the back, passed under the armpits of
the under man. The “ bearer " has his feet strapped into
leather footholds fast to the “take off” board. Thus
when they do the “ fall ” across the chasm, they are so
interlocked that, so long as the footholds do not give way,
they simply bend over spinally, like a bamboo which is
fast in the ground at one end. If there were any wires in
the case, and anything did go wrong, the men would
probably be cut in half. As it is. thev can't fall unless
somebody’s spine breaks, which is not unlikely. The
Leonard Family, by the way, do not receive anything
extra for this feat. The 'cute Bland has got them at
music-hall salaries.—B.E.
Olga Netbersole hurt her knee badly while playing

Sydney D.T. recently stated that “ He thinks I do not
love him ” was written expressly for Mme. Enriquez by
Sainton Dolby. Early copies of that ancient song (which
was composed, not written, by Sainton Dolby) make no
mention of Enriquez on the cover, anyway.
Arthur Dacre was, in the days when he followed the
practice of medicine, house-surgeon at the public hospital
jn Northampton.
Leading members of the Gaiety 00. say Melb. Princess’s
is the finest theatre they have ever played in, not even
barring the London ’ouses.
Two months ago little Penley stated that half-a-million
of money had been made out of “Charley’s Aunt." And
it is still running in many directions, British and
“ foreign.”
The widow of David James died the other day, and her
estate, by the will of her husband, passes into the hands
of trustees for distribution, as they see fit, amongst
various charities. The late comedian left £40,000 in
trust for bis wife during her lifetime, but cut off his son,
David James, junr., without a shilling. Strange be-
haviour for an actor. The British drama is somewhat
rough on angry fathers who disinherit their offspring.
Dr. Neild, in a criticism of “ La Pompadour,” senten-
tiously observes; “Voltaire, in Mr. Webster’s hands,
showed much intelligence.” So unlike Voltaire, too.
A co. is being formed at Broken Hill to replace the
Theatre Royal, burned to the ground two years ago.
Theatrical business in the Hill has lately been excellent,
notwithstanding that the best hall is little more than a
barn.
Graphic little touch from “In Town.” Capt. Bradfleld
Coddington opens letter and reads; —“ Dear Sir, —We are
requested to apply to you for payment.” “Chestnuts!”
he snaps, and flings it away.
When Arthur Dacre told the gushing ladies of the Aus-
tral Salon, Melb., that he and Mrs. Dacre were about to
give dramatic entertainments at the Athenaeum Hall, they
said that he could count on 200 members of that select
and refined club attending. Dacre was delighted, and
felt that if this was the sort of patronage he was going to
get the entertainments were bound to be an immense
success. But the eventful night came, and the 200 were
not there, nor did they turn up at all. Meeting a leading
member of the club lateiyhe said: “I thought you pro-
mised that at least 200 members of your club would come
to our entertainment ?” “So we would have done,” was
the cool reply, “ only you did not send us admission
tickets.” “No,” said Dacre, rubbing his chin, and hold-
ing back a naughty word, “ I didn’t send tickets. How
thoughtless of me, wasn’t it ?” It was.
Madge Rossell’s pas sent in the “ Gaiety Girl ” was first
brought out on the American stage by that vain and
lovely Irish girl, Cissy Fitzgerald, who fairly' turned the
heads of the New Yorkers, and now quite expects to find
herself mated to a royal prince before Xmas.
Amy Roselle learns her parts by copying the words out
in her own handwriting. Ellen Terry and Mrs. Patrick
Campbell do ditto.
Osmond Carr, composer of Gilbert’s latest opera, “ His
Excellency,” is the genius responsible for the reminiscent
music-hall tunes of “In Town.” Gilbert’s libretto must
be funny if it can carry Carr’s music successfully.
Irving leaves the stage next year.
Experience proves travelling concert parties must have
a very big woman-a top-sawyer, and then all the r<st
maybe comparative puppets. The star baritone, belie
Marsh, or Brownlow, or Ryley, don’t draw worth a cent
without the big woman.
Peacock, Vie. Minister of Education, doesn’t seem to
have mastered the working of a Haunted Swing. In Mel-
bourne, the other day, he jumped off the swing whilst
the illusion was in motion, and Peacock’s tail went down
before MacMahon could sound the alarm and stay pro-
ceedings. A more cautious searcher after truth was the
Melb. doctor, who, after half-a-dozen rides orr the Swing,
begged permission to bring along a spirit-level that he
might convince himself he wasn’t being whirled around.
Thete-are vast possibilities of cure for nervous complaints
in the Haunted Swing, which ought to be.run in conjunc-
tion with electric-baths.
Dear Bulletin,— -The drama wants democratising. At
present every front-rank play has first to pteasaa London
society audience. Society only cares about society, and
nine out of every ten plays lake place in London drawing-
rooms ; middle and lower-class life is only used for farcical
comedy. The novelist can take his subjects anywhere, so

Dear Bulletin, —The writer of the refer-
ence to the late Chas. Bad ham, in y our issue of
May 4, is evidently unaware that the eloquent
sentences attributed to him were written by
Sydney Smith, and form part of a famous passage
on “The Pleasures of Knowledge’’-—given in
“ Royal Reader,” Part VI. H.L.
Michael Davitb, as a lecturer, is rather dis-
appointing. He reads his discourse, for the most
part, from bits of paper piled upon a music-stand
at his side, and, his matter being full of statistics
and small details, he is bound to read it carefully.
When he gets away from the music-stand and
talks to the audience, Davit!; is so fluent, earnest,
and interesting that his return to the old spot is
deeply regretted. Yet the written stuff is very
sound, and “reports” well in the newspapers.
There is nothing wild in Michael Davitt’s social-
ism ; he has “passed too many milestones for
that.” He commends John Burns for allying
himself with the Liberal party, for the oppor-
tunist reason that the Liberals are of some value
to the Democratic cause, and it follows, therefore,
that Davitt can see very little political promise in
Keir Hardie’s red Republican cap. An enthusiast,
mellowed by experience, is this good Irishman.
He thinks less about the particular wrongs of
Ireland than the wrongs of the masses every-
where. Also, he accepts wrong-doing by wealthy
classes as a natural outcome of selfish human
nature, and advises the majority to do the best
they can for themselves, instead of railing against
the powerful minority who do their worst for the
workers. In short, Davitt preaches Reform
through a reformed Parliament; a millionium,
and not a millennium. And, so far from playing
the “down-trodden counthry ” in melody on
sympathetic heart-strings, Mr. Davitt claims for
Ireland, with her 70, or more, Radical members
in the British Parliament, the undeniable credit
of leading the way to a better state of things in
Great Britain. Anyone unacquainted with
Davitt would guess him to be a benevolent
Hebrew rather than an ex-Fenian Irishman, from
his appearance on the platform.

Treasurer Ward and his colleagues are now
talking in a jubilant strain about converting the whole
Maoriland publio debt into a uniform 3 per cent, stock,
whereby it is freely asserted in some quarters that a
saving of £300,000 per annum may be effected. The
saving looks about as hopeless as anything well can be.
The old 6 and 5 per cent, loans which fall due during the
next few years could Be converted, either now or as they
fall due, with profit, hut the biggest part of the debt,
£29,000,000 at 4 per cent., is not due for 35 years, and if
tiie beautiful Ward asks the holders to surrender this, in
exchange for 3 per cent, stock at any thing like par, they
will probably mistake him for a lunatic and want to have
him medically examined. Perhaps if the Treasurer offered
(say) £l2O at 3 per cent, for each £lOO debenture, the
proposal might be accepted, and then the province would
save £116,000 in the immediate present, and incur
an additional liability of nearly £6,000,000 to do it. It
can’t be done any other way, and the game looks too
much like the old, old .device of passing the liability on
to posterity. If any law could be enacted whereby (say)
£lOO,OOO of the amount annually saved would be set aside
as a sinking-fund for the redemption of the debt, and the
said law could be made so immoveable that it could never
he repealed, or evaded, or altered in any Way, the scheme
would answer splendidly at the price. But, then, nobody
can make a law of sufficiently water-tight materials.
* * * *
It is now asserted that the Colonial Bank (Mel-
bourne) proposes to reduce interest on fixed deposits to
24 per cent.—a woeful drop from the 4J promised. Also,
that the City of Melb. desires to reduce interest to a
nominal 3 per cent., but of this the depositor is to get
2J only, the other 10s. per cent, being set aside to form a
reserve-fund, presumably towards repayment of the prin-
cipal, so that the depositor will some day get his money
back, partly, at least, out of the interest which he didn’t
receive. Reconstruction has come down to a very bare
and hungry science, if the depositor is to be thus invited
to eat himself for his own support.

The aldermen of the semi*busted borough of
Balmain, having raised all the money they can get from a
person named Cohen, and being harassed by an (allegedly
unlawful) overdraft, and otherwise financially distracted,
are now seeking authority to mortgage the local town
hall, and are freely calling each other liars over the
negotiation. By-and-bye it will be found necessary to
appoint a State auditor, with extensive powers of veto,
to supervise the financial arrangements of aldermen.

Sydney City Mutual Life Assurance Society has
completed its fourth triennial investigation and has a

The St. James Building Society (Melb.) reported
that during the half-year it has reduced its deposit in-

and moved for “further Information ” as to the society’s
position, and was promptly snuffed out. The shareholders
didn’t want further information on any account. The
information they already possessed left them just room to
hope that some day their money might come back to
them, and no one was willing to inspect the reasons for
that hope too closely for fear of injuring it.

The case of the Victorian Master in Equity v.
the Bank of Victoria is growing wearisome. When the
bank suspended it had on hand a sura of £30,000 deposited
by the Master, being money owing to certain legatees in
England. The Master claimed that this amount ranked
as a Govt, deposit which had a first claim to repayment;
the hank claimed that it was an ordinary deposit, and
insisted on reconstructing it along with the rest. The
case was argued in the Supreme Court, and before the
Full Court, and in other places, and one of the British
legatees has spent two years in Victoria trying to get a
set lenient, and the final decision is still in suspense,
and the bank and everybody else has run up a powerful
hill of costs over the matter, to no purpose as yet. The
utterly astounding feature in the story is that the Bank
of Vi toria should want to fight the miserable case at all.
That institution states, in its balance-sheet, that it has
something like £1,500,000 of cash, for which apparently it
can’t find profitable investment, ana it is worried by
the necessity of paying an exorbitant 44 per cent, on
deposits. The £30,000 in dispute is a mere speck in this
enormous cash reserve, and by paying it the bank would
save about £1350 a year in interest, and a lot more in law
costs. Altogether it is an astonishing dispute about
nothing, or rather less.

The Permanent Mutual Benefit Building and
Investment Society (Sydney) is Winding up after an exist-

some time ago by defalcations, and though it made a

reduced it to such a shadowy condition that it was hardly
worth while professing to keep the scrag-end of the old
institution, alive any longer.

The New Zealand Estates Go., which holds
most of the old landed securities of the 8.N.Z., is said to
have a scheme for disposing of a lot of its properties by a
lottery of £850,000. Considering the woeful ill-luck of
the V.D.L. Bank lottery, the project looks none too
cheering, but there is ho other visible means of getting
rid of the great white elephant at anything like the price
paid for it. Meanwhile, the 8.N.Z., which is the real
owner of the Estates Co.-, is alleged to he cutting 10 per
cent, off all salaries over £2OO per annum.

The Enterprise Permanent Building Society
(Melh.) reconstructs and, reduces interest on deposits to'
24 per cent with a promise of more when circumstances
allow. This makes the twentieth society, or thereabouts,
which has reduced interest to 24 per cent., and every such
reduction makes it a harder row to hoe for the bank with
a great mass of fixed 44 per cent, deposits. Any day,
now, you can see advts. in the Age offering money on
freehold security, town or country, at 44 and even 44 per
cent. Where does the 44 per cent, reconstructed bank
come in under suoh circumstances ?

The Manly Co-operative Ferry 00. has made a

per annum on its paid-up capital of £1665. It pays a div.
at the rate of 10 per cent, per annum, and, after making
sundry allowances, has £929 to carry forward. The 00.
has £2691 in actual cash, in addition to various small
items of property, against the £1665 subscribed by its
shareholders—a splendid result considering that it runs
with hired steamers at the very humble fare of sixpence,
and one that is calculated to make the old, conservative

siders what a business it has thrown away.

• The little Bank of Adelaide—-the only S.A.
bank now surviving—professes to be still in good health,
and pays its accustomed 7 per cent. div. The utter ab-
sence of fluctuations is the most striking feature of this
‘institution. The profit of £31,000 is only a fraction more
than that of the two previous years ; the same invari-
■ able £3OOO has been carried to reserve, making it now
£149,000 ; and the same invariable £15,000 is carried for-
ward. The boom and the burst and the depression all
apparently make no difference to the Bank of Adelaide.
Its total liabilities to the public are only £1,947,000, and
against this it has £680,000 in cash and Government
debentures, .and £430,000 in other liquid assets, so that
while the present system of management continues, it
should be able to meet the worst storm that is likely to
come its way.

applied to Judge Holroyd in Melb. Practice Court for

fire. His Honor recommended the applicants to consult
Croa’n counsel as to whether a criminal prosecution would
lie ; counsel replied, Tire Bulletin supposes, that it would
lie if somebody could prove felonious intent. Whereupon
the Mercantile Bank liquidators probably muttered
“Dam 1” and dropped the subject. The liquidator, by

The rise in Australian leathers at ’Ome will enor-
mously benefits several Big Vic. tanners provided present
prices are maintained another three months. On the
other hand, the rise in the price of wheat does not benefit
five in a hundred Vic. growers. The millers, mortgage
companies, or the storekeepers have, for the past two
seasons, taken the crops off the ground on liens, and
credited the growers at then current rates. Even should
present rates be maintained next harvest, the heavy
differences against the farmers for the last and former
years’ crops will eat up the profits, and nothing but a
European war or an unprecedented failure of American
wheat-crops next year will pull the small Yic. wheat-

The first sugar beet-crop grown in N.S. Wales—
that recently planted for exp“rimental purposes at Ten-
terfleld—is reported to be yielding an average of 3J tons
of sugar per acre. This is calculated as equal to a cash
return of £2l per acre. If this brilliant average can be
maintained, then beet growing in N.S.W. will pay
three times as well as cane growing in Queensland, and
N.S.W., Victoria, Tasmania, S. A., and Maoriland should
be able to grow their own sugar supply, and he indepen-
dent nf the nigger-grown products of other lands. Even
if 30 per cent, has to be knocked off this gilded estimate,
beet growing should pay better than either maize, wheat,
or pnlatoes, and there should still be room for a con-
siderable reduction in the price of sugar, and the industry
should find employment for 20,000 able-bodied inhabitants

Melo ; Any bank employing an inquiry clerk to

position as ever ; for in a year or so, as a bank official, he
would have got out of touch with the distributing world,

closed to him. The more effective plan would be for the
banks to subsidise a T.P. Society of undoubted repute to
give the reports, and allow one of their best men to he

An important question is shortly to be tried
h'-fore Vic. Supreme Court. Can a mortgagee, under the
Transfer of Land Act, distrain on his mortgagor for
interest, as a landlord can for rent? South Australia has
already answered the question in the negative, and so has
Maoriland ; but, though the wording of the first Vic. Act
is the same as that of S.A., there is a slight difference in
the later Vic. Act. Numberless actions for trespass, &0.,
hang on the decision. The answer will depend on whether
the words “ occupier or tenant ” include mortgagor, and
on whether the insertion of a clause making the mort-
gagor a tenant is in accordance with the policy of the
Torrens system.

The Bulletin’s London correspondent: “ I
have the authority of a very big stockbroker for the state-
ment that the value of shares passing through the
clearing-house of the Stock Exchange at each fortnightly
settlement tots up to £100,000,000. As there is a broker-
age of from 3d. to Cd. upon most high-priced Kaffir
shares, the gains of brokers must be enormous. I have
heard of a man who has made £90,000 in three months by
mere brokerage. And the game goes merrily on. Had
it not been for the Londonderry fiasco, Westralian shares,
which are now lifeless, would be at boom prices. That
may yet arrive.”
* * * «
So far, the Westralian boom is the most unsatis-
factory of all the big spurts of late years. India in 1880-1,
Queensland in 18S6-7, and the Transvaal in 1889-’9O were
immediately succeeded by yields more comim nmrate
with the optimism of London Exchange. The pity of it
is that the British investor won’t take permanent fright.
The consequence of mining flotations on a boom scab* is
that a lot of capital changes hands in London. If the
thing is a success Australia has some more of the absentee
plague to bear. If the boom fizzles no money worth
speaking of las come to this country. Success means
that Australia has to pay dividends on the capital it
didn’t get. Failure means that it doesn’t have to pay
dividends on the capital it didn’t get.

If no one will give a list of Westralian com-
panies floated in London with their new names and the

one. Lots of mines lately traded off have been re-
ohristened in London. “Why?” When Pritchard
Morgan first went to England he took with him a Towers
mine, which, after the rude manner of the Australian
digger, had been called “The Scotchman.” “You’ll
have to alter that,” remarked a friend of W.P.M.’s—
“ they don’t like Scotchmen in London. Call it the
‘Disraeli.’” Which was done. But the Westralian
alleged mines have not all been re-christened for so satis-
factory a reason.

Dear Bulletin, —You advertise the prospectus
of the Central Queensland G.M. Proprietary Co., and
state in a “Wild-Cat” par. that “those who get in on
the ground-floor of the original proprietary shares (£5)
should do well enough.” Do you know anything of this
co.’s properties? Ido. The co. is being formed locally with
a capital of £30,720, which it is proposed subsequently to
increase to £200,000 by London flotation. Its property
includes 840 acres freehold and 415 acres leasehold on the
Calliope goldfield, near Gladstone, C.Q. The promoters’
circular lays special stress upon the fact that the property
is in the neighborhood of Me. Morgan. The “Port Curtis
rush ” is also alluded to, and it is stated that the rock
formation at Calliope resembles that of Gympie. As
Mt. Morgan is a unique formation 30 miles away, while
the “Port Curtis rush " (nowhere near Port Curtis) was
130 miles away, the information does not seem to have
any special relevancy. It is true that names like thes«
look well on a prospectus.
The co.’s strong card is the freehold in New
Zealand Gully, Calliope. The Gladstone manager of the
A.J.S. Bank estimates that 280,0000 z. gold were taken
out of the gully during the first rush (about ’64). At first
sight, it may seem strange to try and prove that ground
is worth working because “literally tons’’of gold have
been taken out of it. It would be more to the point to
show that tons of gold remained in it. The prospect,
however, is probably not so bad for the shareholders as
the bank-manager would make out; for my estimate
of the Calliope yield is about 30,0000 z. altogether,
so that if there ever were 260,000nz. there, there should
still remain 250,0000 z. for the benefit of the projected
London co. The bank-manager also asserts that “ prior
to the conversion of New Zealand gully into freehold
estate, the old miners were only able to take up individual
ground to the extent of 12ft. by 12ft. [this should be
20ft. by' 20ft.]; and,as near as lean learn, about 2000 men
[should be 500] found for over a year [should be nearly six
months] a rich [fair] harvest in New Zealand gully, work-
ing with the crude implements of cradle and pan [sluice-
box], and only then securing the coarsest gold” [i.e.,
working it out so thoroughly that for years after the
rush was over miners fossicked, prospected, and worked in
the gully for less than £1 per week, and only left when
they couldn’t make rations]. As 1 speak with the
authority of a man who was all through the Calliope rush,
and would have starved on it afterwards if I hadn’t
cleared out, you will probably wonder what is really the
interest and value of the remaining “ interesting infor-
mation and valuable records of the local goldfields ”
which the manager says the A.J.S. Bank possesses ; and
which, singularly enough, it refrains from publishing.
So much for the A.J.S. bank-manager. The
report next in importance comes from “Capf. Larkins,
mining manager.” This gentleman has examined the
co.’s properties, and has naturally seen the numerous
reefs visible along the sides of the gullies. So have hun-
dreds of others before him, but no one has ever found a
payable reef, though there have been many trials. Capt.
Larkina mentions three reefs in particular—Wood’s,
Spicer’s, and the Reginald. All three had good trials and
were deserted because they wouldn’t pay rations. Capt.
Larkins say's “fully nine-tenths of the gully were left
untouched ” —which is probably only his playful little
way of putting things, since 4dvvt. to the load, with one
foot of vvashdirt, was considered worth working in the
N.Z. gully, even during the rush. Taking it as a face,
it would probably go about 2grs. to the load. The co., by
the way, proposes to sluice the gully and expose the reefs.
As Capt. Larkins has seen that “ the reefs overhang the
gully,” why sluice to get them? Capt. Larkins also
refers to “ very rich leaders.” Only one rich leader was
found, and that didn’t give over 150 oz. at the outside.
The co. quotes “T. S. G. Fitzpatrick—the great
authority on hydraulic sluicing,” as giving these “ four
essentials for successful hydraulic mining ” :
1. Abundance of auriferous gravel.
2. Abundance of water.
3. A good dump.
4. A properly-constructed sluice.
To which I take the liberty of adding another “essential ”:
5. Sufficient gold in the gravel.
As to water, the nearest part of the Boyne River is 3
miles distant from the head of N.Z. gully ; and, as the
water would not come by gravitation, it would have to be
pumped. Consequently, the difference of opinion be-
tween my estimate and the prospectus estimate pans
out like this: River dredging—prospectus estimate,
lOgrs. per load ; my estimate, 2grs. per load.
Hydraulic sluicing—prospectus estimate, 2dwts. per
load ; my estimate, 2grs. per load. Quartz crushing*
- prospectus estimate of cost, 15s. per ton ; I ven-
ture no estimate—only the remark that it costs about £1
a ton to raise and crush Phoenix P.O. stone on Gympie,
where the reef is 20ft. wide. As the very influential
board of directors will probably have sufficient matter for
consideration in these few' remarks, I hold over a variety
of other remarks with the same tendency until they are
wanted.—An Old Q. Miner.
The Bulletin gets the above letter from a man
whose name is known to every miner in Queensland,
and whose bond fides it has no reason to doubt.
The statements made are, however, so sweep-
ing that before publication this paper thought
it only fair to give Mr. J. O. Sachs, who represents the
promoters, an opportunity to comment upon the holes
picked in his prospectus. And Mr. Sacha points out
that his witnesses to the value of the properties
are at least as good as “ An Old Q. Miner,” and there
are considerably more of ’em. For example, Messrs.
J. and G. Hickson are well-known residents of Gladstone ;
they were both, Mr. Sacha affirms, through the rush to
New Zealand gully; and they give their opinion that
“the entire gully systematically sluiced on a face will
average at least 6dwt. to the load.” Mr. Sachs points out
that this opinion is backed up by many tests, which he
is confident are reliable ; and he pertinently asks, if it is
a question of memory and experience, are not the memory
and experience of Messrs. Hickson as good as those of
“An Old Q. Miner ”?—who has probably not been over
the ground so recently as those who have faith in its
future.
Mr. Sachs positively denies that any of the reefs
mentioned had good trials —or the Alexandra either,
which is not mentioned. He positively denies that the
N.Z. Gully was ever sluiced wide of the gutter. And lie
points out that it is one thing to test ground on a small
scale with comparatively primitive appliances, and anotlu r
thing to work on a large scale with first-class appliances.
He also draws attention to the fact that “An Old Q.
Miner” leaves comparatively out of consideration the
profits which the co. hopes to draw from dredging the
Boyne—that is, beyond giving his unsupported and con-
temptuous sniff that the dredging wouldn’t pay. And he
admits that mining is a game of chance, but asserts that a
mass of evidence and a great number of tests justify him
in thinking the chances of the Central Queensland G.M.
Proprietary 00. really brilliant.
However, there are, no doubt, lots of miners
who have dug gravel and chipped reefs in N.Z. gully, and
The Bulletin would like to hear from some of them
before definitely committing itself to the opinion that the
venture is likely to pay. One point should certainly be
made clear. The prospectus says nothing about pumping,
but Mr. Sachs states that the distance from the river
point helow the head of the gully is If miles, with’a
rise of 55ft. It is proposed to have a £lO,OOO pump on the
bank of the river, and lift the water into a reservoir not
at the head of the gully, but at some point below the
head. Here there will be another pump, and it is appar-
ently intended to get a sluice-head force from this pump
instead of directly from the reservoir—which will seem-
ingly not be high enough to give the power. These
details are rather dim, but they give opportunity for two
questions: (1) Can you lift water 55 feet and deliver it
If miles away, and then lift it again to get a sufficient
head for sluicing purposes over, say, a mile of gravel, at
Is. per load—the cost estimated by the co. ? (2) Will
gravel, averaging 2dwts. to the load, pay under such cir-
cumstances, with, say, £35,000 sunk in plant ; two pumps
going ; and piping, fuel, working expenses over an ex-
tended face, &c., to be provided for ? There should be
statistics in Maoriland or Tasmania to answer these
questions.

A BEAUTIFUL COMPLEXION.
Ifc has long been known to scientists that for
improving the appearance and beautifying the
face oatmeal is far and away superior to all other
foods, but it had one drawback— the tendency to
heat the blood. To overcome this defect the at-
tention of eminent scientists has been devoted to
the removal of this imperfection; and now, after
long years of careful and diligent research, art has
triumphed, and Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats is the
result, for, by skilful manipulation in the manu-
facture, all the heating properties have been ex-
tracted, so that now a beautiful complexion of
peach and ivory may be had by anyone who make*
a continuous use of Uncle Toby’s Rolled Oats.

Directly Davitt appeared on the platform

Georgey Porgey, who wrote this some years ago,

David Syme overcame his anti-Irish preju-
dices sufficiently to admit of his paper saying that
Michael Davitt was worth welcoming “as a man,’’
“although he is a Freetrader and a bimetallist.”
It is a point gained to have it admitted that one
cm differ from D. Syme and still be considered a
man. There is, however, much humor in that
word “although.”
The design for the memorial tablet to the
late Sir Robert Duff, which is to be erected by
“the women of New South Wales,” describes him
as “ Governor-in-Chief.” Why in-ohief? Is it
feared that students of mortuary inscriptions
might suppose him to have been Governor of Dar-
linghurst or Berrima gaols? But, after all, per-
haps it was necessary to be a little specific. The
Scotch people know that the deceased gentleman
did go to Botany Bay.
The lately - deceased Yesey Fitzgerald,

from office after the Eureka blunder on the pro-

ceeded in getting any compensation, and was until
his death a “ man with a grievance.”
“TheN.S.W. Chief Railway Commissioner,

reorganisation, is quite willing to make a large

J. F. Burns, who heads the movement for
a memorial to the late John Robertson, was “ old

he did not accept a portfolio till 14 years after.
Except for a few months immediately following
the Parkes-Robertson Coalition, Burns main-

Clovelly for nearly 40 years.
Captain Bull, antarctic explorer and plat-

siders that he knows all about the Northern
waters. Besides, he contends that only a Nor-
wegian can find the North Pole.
Some time ago, Capt. Henri Saul Samuel,
son of the N.S.W. veteran Agent-General, met
with a sad accident which deprived him of one
leg, and thus stopped his active career as a com-
batant officer. At the time he was engaged to be
married to a very attractive young lady—who has
now, nevertheless, completed the engagement.
The marriage took place on 10th April. Captain
Samuel, for whom much sympathy is felt, has
been transferred to the Paymaster - General’s
Department, and will not leave the army.
“ Yorky Bill,” the friend of
alleged poisoner Dean’s mother-in-
law : “I’ve had some hair-breadth
escapes in my time, I’ve sien and
undergone enougli torture to grizzle
the nerves of a giant. I had once
to help build a scaffold for the hang-
ing of eight men, and I remember
the gaol chaplain —who was a holy
counterfeit, if ever there was one—
remarking to the head-screw, the
night after the eight blokes were
stretched : ‘Well, my man, it was
a tight squeeze; the eight hung
comfortably enough, but I fancy
nine would have found it a trifle
crowded.’” A venerable chestnut.
In one version which the present
writer heard, 20 years ago, tlie
chaplain was Rev. Bedford, father-
in-law to the late N.S.W. Chief
Justice Stephen,
Judge Molesworth, of Vic.
insolvent-court celebrity, when a
barrister, was particularly fond of
the Belfast and Warrnambool
circuits, where any man who en-
gaged him for the defence was sure
of acquittal. For, as now, he had
a brogue that you could cut with a
knife. He defended a small farmer
before Justice Williams for sheep-
stealing. The case was clear—in
fact, accused had pleaded guilty in
the court below, thinking to get off
with six monthsfrom the “Binch.”
Molesworth put all the brogue he
could command into his address to
the jury, and on returning with
their verdict the 12 good men and
true of Belfast, Koroit, and Killar-
ney brought in a verdict of “ not
guilty.” Judge Williams gasped
and asked them how, after the
prisoner had pleaded guilty in the
police-court, they could return such
a verdict? Said the foreman :
“Shure, Mr. Molesworth told us that O’Finnessey
wasnotguilty, andwebelave him before anybody.”
Countess Wachmeister, the Theosophical
emissary now in Melbourne, was Blavatsky’s com-
panion when that corpulent lady wrote her big
book, “The Secret Doctrine,” and found most of
money for its publication. She claims to be a
clairvoyant, and says she sees “aura” round the
heads of people, in which she can read their
thoughts. If she can read the thoughts of some
people to whom she tells this, she must read some-
times queer things about herself,
Dr. Strong, Melbourne’s most liberal-
minded parson, is said to be tired of that city, and
in search of an American opening. He founded
Je Australian Church, after his secession from
the Presbyterians, largely in consequence of Higin-
botham’s lecture on “Religion and Science.”
Since he took to preaching a mild type of Social-
ism, however, he has discovered that many of
those who profess to be liberal in religion can be
mighty illiberal in other things.
Michael Davitt, after lecturing in Victoria,
goes back to Westralia to write some letters on
Coolgardie for London Daily Chronicle. As
Davitt’s best known work is his “ Prison Diary,”
these letters ought to be interesting, for he will
meet at Coolgardie all the rehabilitated cronks
from the four corners of the earth. It is to be
hoped he will dry-blow his facts before publica-
t^on ' a * a b°ut a panny weight of truth goes to a
ton of Coolgardie statement. He is due in Sydney

Davitt has the utmost contempt for poetry
dedicated to himself, and quite fails to conceal his
dislike for slobbering speeches. When he replies
to an address he never makes the slightest acknow-
ledgment of the personal references in it. At
elb - °, eltio C [ ub > after some fulsome orations of
the U3Ual sort - he aro3e and said he would have to
go, as it was growing late. The promise of a few
comic songs, as a bar to farther slaver, detained
him for half-an-hour longer. His references to
Parnell are kindly and in good spirit. It is said
he regrets the stand he took against Parnell when
that great leader was sacrificed to the “Noncon-
formist Conscience.”
THAT LITTLE INNOCENT AGAIN!
“Please , ma'am, have you got the toothache?”
Max Hirsch was lavish with the “ marma-
lade 1 ’ after Michael Davitt’s second lecture in
Melbourne, and M.D. sat ill at ease in his chair
whilst M.H. laid it on with a trowel. Presently
he (the lecturer) remarked that Max “ must at one
time, or other, have visited a certain place in
Ireland.” No explanation was required. The
audience knew the place—some of them had
been there —and they laughed in moderation.
Not much, because-the modest D ivitt jokes under
protest at all times and seemed sorry to have any
occasion to joke on this delicate subject.
The Earl of Fingall is a slightly-built
young man, with a rath-r ruddy face, and a heavy
red moustache. When the Londonderry out up
so ignominiously, the Earl, who had thought to
blast out a ton of gold a day, was absolutely
thnnderstricken ; in* fact, he became so depressed
that his friends thought be might hurt himself.
To cure him, they led him by the ear to the
“MONOTONY IS HELL”
A rich man, one Smith, died, and, naturally enough, went to Sheol.
Much to his surprise he found himself in a most comfortably-furnished
room, not at all unlike his old, familiar den at the club, and presently a
waiter appeared. “Waiter,” said the new-comer, “is this really Hell?”
“Yes, sir,” replied the waiter, “this is Hell. ” “Then I’d like to see the
manager,” remarked the astonished ex-clubman. Presently the Devil
came. “Do you really mean to tell me,” said Mr. Smith, “ that this is
Hell?” “Yes, it is,” said the Devil. “Well,” continued the stout
gentleman, “it's most astonishing—it seems a very pleasant place. I
find nothing whatever to complain of so far!” “ No,” replied Satan,
grimly, “perhaps not yet; but remember, my dear sir, it’s like this
always !"
Wealth of Expectations, after seeing which he
felt much better. The Earl has learned a great
lesson. “My face is my fortune, sir, she said.”
Sensational mines say this just like “ sensa-
sational ” woman.
A Sydney pressman has one pleasing
reminiscence of Primate Bob-cab Smith. He was
booked for a meeting at the Chapter House, and
sauntered round St. Andrew’s in search of the
place, at last knocking at the likeliest-looking
door. Tne Primate opened in person. “Is this
the—the Chapel Hall?” blurted the reporter.
“Tnis is the Chapter House.” “Oh, it’s all the
same. There’s a meeting here, isn’t there ? I’m
a Herald man.” The bishop invited him inside,
and, after striking a match on a convenient por-
tion of “ the cloth,” lit a candle and gave particu-
lars. The way in which the Primate struck that
match caused the reporter to accept him as a man
and a brother.
The somewhat Spanisb-looking Michael
Davitt has only a slight brogue. He is not a
rapid speaker; the words roll out slowly and
deliberately—a style of oratory just suited to his
nervous temperament. His deeply-lined face
bears the marks of a life of suffering, and, though
his beard is but partially tinged with grey, he
looks older than he is ; in fact, looking at him the
other day, the writer would have thought he had
only just emerged from that seven years’ im-
prisonment which was the outcome of Gladstone’s
coercion policy. The Adelaide Single-taxers, in
presenting him with an aldress, dubbed him
“ M.P.,” but Davitt has not been in the Imperial
Parliament for many years.
Cardinal Moran, according to
a recent interviewer, admires ex-
Premier Dibbs, takes a great personal
interest in ex-Premier Parkes, and
always votes for Premier Reid ; l le
also takes a deep and sympathetic
interest in Mr. Wise, and has a pro-
found respect for Mr. See. “God
is good, but the Devil’s not so bad
either.” Reid is luckiest—he gets tlie
vo‘e. Seeing that Archbishop
Vaughan, the Cardinal’s prede-
cessor, boasted of also voting for Mr.
Reid, it looks as if Georgey Porgey
were a very mellow type of Scotch
Presbyterian.
“ Dan ” Brophy died at Bal-
larat the other day. Those were
times indeed when Dan contested
Ballarat East, and Bungaree con-
tested Dan’s opponents. John James
and James Russell have since those
days been declared elected by Re-
turning-Officer Death. Bungaree did
its best by James and Russell. It
upset their cabs into ditches, it cut
the harness off their horses, it sent
their agents flying naked q;r ragged
hither and thither across the potato
fields, and castigated them for inter-
fering wid the spuds. Those were
wild and innocent times of , manly
competition. Since then Dungaree has been made
a separate constituency, and the faithful pocket
borough of Edward Murphy and his historic wife.
Mr. Lewis Morris, it is cabled, has been
“ created ” a Knight Bachelor, in honor of Queen
Victoria’s birthday. The late laureate Tennyson
was regarded as worthy of that high honor, with
which Y.K. thinks fit to encourage the great
British Peerage; but Mr. Morris is only a
petty huckster of a poet, and no fit associate for
the Aristocracy of Swipes. To him, therefore, is
meted out just that decoration which is given to
successful and wealthy butchers. A terrible
insult : but a man practically invites such when
he writes this sort of tiling—
Qiinen of England, I have sung
The husband that you loved so well ;
Now I sing yourself, O Empress,—
Long may you in glory d veil!
This isn't exactly Morris, but it’s not unlike.

wherewith he conducts

emileless, bloodless Pil-
cher never allows his
soul to catch fire, he is
as acute as any man at
the Australian bar, and
—if his brief has been
“ properly marked -
as energetic and whole-
souled. Pilcher, like
Salomons, will work
hard out of Court, but
so far as the world has
discovered, the heaviest
case does not make his
heart beat two strokes
a minute faster. Of
late he has done little
criminal practice, but
his defence of a Govern-
ment servant charged
with embezzlement a
few years ago was a
most notable effort.

The Bulletin hopes that when N.S.W.
Civil Service is remodelled, the names of the
first board of Commissioners will be submitted to
Parliament for approval, and that Parliament will
insist on deleting the name of any secret-society
man— Freemason, Orangeman, Hibernian, or other
—whom it is proposed to appoint.
B. R. Wise’s vote on Parkes' want of con-
fidence motion was regarded from the first as most
uncertain, and B.R.W. recognised the public
doubt in the matter by going so far as to place in
a sealed envelope (which he deposited with friends),
just after notice of motion was given, a statement
of the side on which he intended to vote. Missing-
word politics ’
The nine or ten new duties which Premier
Reid recently imposed on his own sole authority
and without any notice, were removed four days
later, also on his own sole authority and without
any notice. From which it would seem that
Premier Reid has now wholly superseded Parlia-
ment as the taxation authority of N.S.W,, and
that the new authority doesn’t know his own
mind, if he has one.
During last N.S.W. Parliament Parkes
nicknamed Dibbs’ official quarters as “a rat-trap,”
and often expressed pride at his coinage of the
term. “Come in here,” he used to represent the
long one as saying, “I have something for every
rodent nature; one thing for one, another for
another, but something toothsome for every true
rodent.” And yet Parkes walked right into
Dibbs’ room last week, and “ was reconciled.”
“ The evil that men do lives after them.”
Here is Parkes out of office again, and with very
little show of returning ; but the statue of Phillip
that he ordered, purely on his own responsibility,
years ago, will arrive in Sydney at the end of the
year. When all is paid it will have cost .£13,000 to
.£15,000 of public money to erect a commonplace
statue to the first gaoler of N.S.W. —a man about
whom personally absolutely nothing is known,
except that he was obviously a most prosaic
representative of his order.
The ex-Claimant’s confession is used by
the Argus as a text for its latest sermon against
the Referendum. Had the ex-butcher’s case been
submitted to the people, it says, he would have
been declared Sir Roger Tichborne by a substan-
tial majority. That is the Argus’ say-so, but,
even if it were true, it does not affect the case for
the Referendum, because it is not proposed to
settle questions of law upon that principle. If
such a proposition were made, however, The Bul-
letin could present a considerable list of modern
instances, showing that the spontaneous senti-
ments of the people are often nearer to truth and
justice than the deliberative opinions of the most
wise Judges.
The Argus sent over chief-reporter Cun-
nigham to Sydney last week to spy out the
land. The joy of Victoria at the impending
free opening of the N.S.W. market to Vic. pro-
ducers without any quid pro quo is patently
delirious. The smack at Federation, consequent
on the proposed destruction of the N.S.W. sugar-
industry to the advantage of the Northern nigger-
labor crowd, is also duly appreciated in the right
quarter.

When the division came in N.S.W.
Assembly it would seem that the once mighty
Parkes controlled exactly two votes besides his
own.
The delay in appointing a N. S. W. Governor
is, if one can believe the signs of the times, actually
inciting N.S.W. Premier Reid to notify the
Colonial Office that if it cannot find a man he
can nominate one. Parkes ?
In Yictoria, imported
leaf tobacco pays a duty of
Is. per lb., while the local
article, in its raw state, is
free, and when manufac-
tured pays only 6d. per lb.
The Max Hirsch party,
therefore, points out that
Victoria loses .£120,212 per
annum through not taxing
local tobacco, cigars, and
cigarettes at the same rate
as the foreign article. This
is the kind of logic which
is built up by fixing a
bleared eye on a mass of
figures and looking at no-
thing beyond them. If the
higher duty were levied on
locally - grown tobacco —
which is now a cheaper
article than the foreign
sample—it would naturally
go up to the same price as
the latter. And if the in-
creased price didn’t reduce
consumption in any way,
then the State would get
the alleged £120,212 per
annum; if it did reduce
consumption then it
wouldn’t. As increased
prices generally do reduce
consumption, the chances
are 1000 to one that it
wouldn’t get anything like
the above amount, and
would merely ruin the Vic.
industry ; for _ Victorian
tobacco, so far, is consider-
ably inferior to American,
and if it had to be sold at
the same price would dis-
appear from the market.
The Freetrader, however,
treats it as a mere sum in
simple proportion ; if to-
bacco tax at a certain rate
yields .£220,000, the same
tax at another certain rate
will yield .£340,000. Which
is just as logical as proving,
by the same rule of three,
that, if three men fall over
aprecipice, thereforetwelve
men will fall over four
precipices.

The Argus’ change of front in re Davitt
amused people. On Wednesday it (in effect) failed
to understand why that man Davitt, a low Irish
agitator, should be permitted to land in Australia
at all. On Thursday Davitt arrived at Adelaide
and announced himself to be a Freetrader. On
Friday the Akgus hailed Davitt as a the
people’s cause and an implacable enemy of tariff
Tories,” who were crushing the unfortunate, but
noble, Irishman under the heel of despotism.
Miss Florence Lloyd is the
specialist of the Gaiety Girlers.
When “In Town” goes up she
developes from a minor into a
major light, and plays the impor-
tant r6le of Lord Olanside for all

Muffshire. One can forgive such a
handsome, joyous, ingenuous johnny
for living by the sweat of a down-
trodden proletariat’s brow. It is a
pleasure to observe the youthful
Clanside’s teeth and hear him talk.

Party Government is rotten
and is doomed. The country wants
no more “ commanding ” figures in
politics. It wants obeying figures
—like G. H. Reid.
The almost-forgotten Edward
Pulsford writes to Sydney Tele-
graph pointing out that the N.S.
Wales sugar-crop for last year was
worth, to the growers, £132,618,
while in its refined state it was
worth .£504,000. “ The whole of
this sum,” he says, “was received
by the Colonial Sugar Refining Co.,
who paid over to cane-growers 26J
per cent, and retained 731 per cent.”
In other words, the co. “retained”
£371,000 out of its N.S.W. trade
alone, said trade representing a
mere fraction of its entire opera-
tions. Yet, in the same article, Mr.
Pulsford states that the profits of
the co. in N.S.W. and five other
provinces were only .£lBB,OOO.
Query: Can the amount paid in
wages to many hundreds of em-
ployes be said to be “retained ”
any more than the amount paid for
cane ? The Colonial Sugar Co. looks
like a tolerably hungry monopoly,
but it certainly isn’t the unspeak-
ably awful affair which Mr. Puls-
ord misrepresents it to bef.
The “ swell ” Irishmen of Melbourne were
conspicuous by their absence from the Davitt re-
ception. The Hon. Nicholas Fitzgerald, M.L.C.
(a prospective K.C.M.G.), and J. Gavan Duffy,
M.L. A., who run as representative “Oawthleeks,”
and get all the Govt, plums as representing the
Irish of Victoria, found it inconvenient to attend.
However, it was just as well, as they would in no
way have represented Irish democratic sentiment,
inasmuch as they are regarded as beating the

In a recent illegal rent-distraint case heard
in Sydney, the plaintiff’s barrister strongly con-
demned the law whereby a landlord could, with-
out any legal proceedings whatever, distrain for
arrears of rent, and urged that the house-owner
should to placed on the same footing as any other
debtor. Whereupon the Judge pointed out that
a landlord’s claim was generally a simple and
easily-proved affair, so that legal process would be
short and the bailiff would get there as
surely as he does now. Only, instead of getting
there for rent only, he would levy for law-costs as
well, and would often double, or treble, or quad-
ruple the debt thereby. After all, while law con-
tinues to be as expensive as it is, the proposed
amendment doesn’t promise to be of much assist-
ance to the tenant.
Schey’s speech upholding the Parkes
motion of censure was his most notable effort up
to date. It was meaty and full of vim, and was
characterised by some charming grotesquenes.
For instance, Schey, who is a somewhat squat
personage himself, with a (say) 50-inch waist-
measurement, calmly alluded to Premier Reid as
“a pot-bellied politician;” likewise, he went on
saying the most venomous things with a beatih-
cally-placid expression on his baby-like counten-
ance, while Premier Reid was squirming in his
seat. In fact, Schey’s was the only speech, save
Wise’s, which did make Reid squirm.
May- Day com mittees and cut-throat euchre!
On the question of ousting H. H. Champion
from all connection with the movement, Social
Democrats and Single-taxers combined against
the Melb. Trades Hall crowd—and kept
Champion. On the question of “gerrymander-
mg” the May Day committee, and all the societies
represented on it, into a Champion Social Demo-
cratic Federation, Trades Hall and Single-taxers
combined against Social Democrats and euchred
Champion, for a time.
Max Hirsch, as a monometallist and Free-
trader, descants glowingly on the glories of old
England, her magnificent advancement, and the
happiness of her people above all other peoples,
whilst, as a Henry Georgian Single-tax apostle, he
sorrows over the woes inflicted upon the workeis
of the smother country by the vampire landlords,
and insists that the system of private ownership
of laud is sinking England in misery. Now the
Tories in the Free-trade camps confound the
Single-taxer’s with the Freetrader’s arguments and
figures.
Dear Bulletin, —Michael Davitt told them
in Melbourne that he did not believe in Socialism,
because it had failed in Paradise with only two
beings to observe its laws, and must therefore fail
in the complex civilisation of our time. This is
almost convincing—it only leaves Michael the
necessity of proving—l, that there_ ever was a
Paradise; 2, that it was run on socialistic prin-
ciples; 3, that individualism and private enter-
prise did not also fail there. The Mosaic account
of the alleged Paradise certainly supplies a land-
lord, a monopolist (of apples), and an eviction.
What do you think ?— Snell.
An interesting point has been suggested in
connection with the recent N.S.W.-Victorian
criminal libel extradition case. The Extradition
Act provides that persons charged with offences
punishable by more than a year’s imprisonment
hard labor, escaping to other provinces, may be sent
back. In this case the Vic. Supreme Court sent
the accused back to N.S.W., but the maximum
punishment for criminal libel is two years’
imprisonment and a fine. Is imprisonment for
two years without hard labor, plus a fine, greater
or less than one year hard ? If less, could Victoria
recover the accused ? The extradition was clearly
illegal.
The reliable “George Pile” points out,
as a reason for the abandonment of the N.S.W.
sugar-cane industry, that “we know the Queens-
crop averages three times the yield ’ ’ per acre of
that in the Southern province. Coghlan, who
ought to know something about it, shows that
Queensland in 1891 produced less sugar for every
acre under cane than N.S. Wales; in ’92 it pro-
duced a fraction more; in ’93—a specially bad
year in N.S.W. —it produced about 20 per
cent. more. And for the area of cane
actually cut, N.S.W. always produces from 30
to 60 per cent, more sugar than Queensland.
From this The Bulletin presumes that Mr. Pile
either never looked at the figures, or couldn’t
understand them, and that he is maundering
through his hat in a very foolish fashion—like
most other people who rush into print in matters
relating to statistics.
When the N.S. Wales land-tax becomes law
it will be necessary for the Reid Government to
speedily make another serious effort at passing a
Local Government Bill—a very different one from
the last—otherwise there will be trouble ahead
among its Sydney supporters. At present Sydney
and a number of other towns meet all their own
local expenditure out of local taxation. They also
pay, in their contribution to the national revenue,
the biggest share of the local expenditure of the
unincorporated districts and they will pay more
than half the land-tax. Meanwhile the unincor-
porated districts will pay the smaller end of the
land-tax and something less than half their own
local expenditure. This arrangement, as tending
to assist the country at the expense of the city, is
good policy in the interests of the nation at large,
but when the city fully realises the nature of the
situation it will feel bad, and the city is the
Foreign-trade stronghold.
The N.S.W. daily papers foam furiously
at the censure-debate speech of Arthur Griffith,
M.P. for Northumberland, who voted for the
Ministry after criticising them so freely and so
flippantly that Premier Reid declared it would be
“a degradation’’ to accept Griffith’s vote.
Griffith’s action is perfectly logical: he had a
choice between two or three devils, and he voted
for the one he thought least objectionable under
the circumstances; but he did not consider it
necessary to prostrate himself devotionally before
the devil of his choice merely because it was going
to get his vote. In fact, he treated Premier Reid
just as the Chinaman treats his Joss when the
latter misbehaves himself —by belting him and kick-
ing him all round the temple. It is not because
you happen to be the god of the hour that you
should escape being kicked in the house of prayer.
The Bulletin has been preaching this doctrine
for years, and is delighted to see Government by
Contradiction falling to bits like the leper it is.

Sociery
Slowbart society received a nasty shock
from a letter written by Mr. G. P. Fitzgerald, one
of the trustees of the ill-fated V.D.L. Bank, on
the subject of perpetuating the memory of the late
Gov. Hamilton. The letter drew attention to the
fact that the last tribute to the memory of this
gentleman and his wife had not been fully paid
for, and that, as a matter of fact, some <£sf> was
still due to the bank, such overdraft having been
paid to the artist for his life-sized portraits of His
Ex. and Lady H. When the Hamiltons were in
Tasmania the air was hardly good enough for
them to breathe, according to the tenets of local
society, and when the first (untrue) rumor of Gov.
Hamilton’s death reached Hobart there was ter-
rific competition in “the very best circles” as to
who should bring along most crape and flowers
—which had to be removed on the cable being
contradicted. The debt should have been taken
off and the crape left on.

Men speak of women as vain and foolish
in their fondness for finery, but no man who has
been to a Queen’s Birthday levee ought ever to do
so again. The peacock conceit of the fellows who
flocked to Melb. and Sydney Govmentouses to
attend the Acting-Governor’s levee was something
comical to behold. Nearly every man in the city
who had the right to wear a colored suit of clothes
or to put on a gaudy University hood, strutted
about, on this occasion, in all the vanity of
elaborate finery, as proud of himself and the
pretty things as the lightest-headed girl in her
first ball-dress who ever blushed at her own
reflection. The road from Govinentouse, before
and after the levee, was lined with popinjays in
feathers and laces and silken hoods strutting along
with their ohms in the air like cook ostriches at
mating time.

Despite efforts made to keep things quiet,
some of the evidence involuntarily elicited by the

name publicly appearing on Madame Rose’s list.

Had poor Gov. Duff died a little sooner
you would have had Brassey as Governor at
Sydney, writes a well-informed correspondent to
The Bulletin from London. It is known that
he would have much preferred N.S. Wales to Vic-
toria—and how yachting would have boomed
under his regime ! It is said that he will have
three craft in commission, a twenty (if not a
forty), a tenner, and a smaller one for her lady-
ship’s own diversion. Another thing ;he would
not have minded a nominal salary, as what he
wants is a lift in the peerage.

The newly-appointed Gov. Buxton has
informed a London interviewer that “ only people
of good moral character will be invited to Ade-
laide Govt. House.” Buxton will have to abandon
this idea or he won’t raise a quorum.
Premier Kingston was much annoyed at the con-
duct of the Colonial Office in practically ignoring
him over the appointment of brewer Buxton as
Governor. Lordßiponpromised tosubrnitthename
of the proposed new Governor for approval before
making the appointment; but the first intimation
was made by Buxton’s London representative to
Agent-General Playford, who received no advice
from the Colonial Office until a day later.

Two exquisites of the London cuff-and-
collar brigade, closely related to the reigning earl
of a celebrated English family, lately struck Cool-
gardie in all the glory of turned-up pants and
gold eyeglasses. They had been lured to Wes-
tralia by the hoary chestnut that on Australian
goldfields lucky diggers are wont to roll up regu-
larly at the nearest hostelry and throw down their
bags of dust on the counter with the remark :
“Just let us know, boss, when that’s gone!”
They have accordingly built a hotel on one of the
rushes, and have just thrown open their bar in
fond anticipation of a rush of thirsty dry-blowers
burdened with a plethora of golden nuggets.
# * *
The Synnot divorce-case, out of which
the bottom and top and all four sides fell
suddenly, the other day, should be read care-
fully by everybody. Synnot sued for divorce
in a Melbourne court, on a charge of wholesale
and retail adultery, and called evidence to prove
that his wife, after she left him, had lived for a
long time without any disguise, and under her
own name, in a house of ill-fame, at Carlton. A
local policeman swore to her ; so did a grocer of
the neighborhood, and the woman next door, and
the woman down the street, and the woman
opposite, and the man opposite, and a detective,
and some other people. Then when the case
seemed absolutely finished, the defence produced
such convincing evidence that Mrs. Synnot had
been in England during the whole period
of her alleged residence in Carlton that
Purves, Q.C., who appeared against her,
threw up his brief and apologised un-
reservedly, and the prosecution departed like
a case that was walking in its sleep. There-
fore it would appear that a policeman, a
detective, a grocer, arid three old residents, after
seeing a woman frequently by broad daylight, and
conversing with her oh several occasions, may all
swear in the most positive manner to the wrong
woman. And when one considers how often a
prisoner is convicted because one man saw him
once for a few seconds amidst a rough-and-tumble
under a dimly flickering gas-lamp, these circum-
stances are very solemn indeed.
Wilkie Collins could have built a thrilling
novel round the Synnot case. He would pro-
bably have made Mrs. Synnot a beautiful and
loveable being who always dressed in spotless
white, and Synnot would have been the wicked
baronet. Some police-agent employed by the
baronet would hunt up a woman who closely
resembled bis wife, and establish her, in the
wife’s name, in a house of ill-fame, and
she would cultivate the acquaintance of the
grocer and the policeman and the neighbors
generally, in order that they might swear to her.
And when the case collapsed, despite the swear-
ing and the documentary evidence, the wicked
husband would break his neck over a wire fence,
and also cut bis throat, and blow bis brains out,
and take poison, and fall into the Yarra, or else
it would transpire that he had a previous wife
living, and that he had really died a long time
previously, and the petitioner was a bogus indi-
vidual who personated him. Finally, by way of
rounding things off, Purves would be found mur-
dered in a hansom cab, and the tale would con-
clude with the wronged wife marrying Judge
Williams, and living to enjoy a happy old age.
Or, by way of another alternative, the lady at
Carlton might be Mrs. Synnot’s twin-sister, who
was supposed to be long dead, and who was run
by a huge Italian conspirator, for ulterior motives
which were explained by the document found in
his vest pocket after death. Altogether, there
are many literary possibilities in the Synnot case.
* * *
Mrs. Synnot certainly ought not to have
been a victim of mistaken identity. It is almost
incredible that eleven witnesses really believed
her guilty of having resided at an “improper
bouse.’’ Mrs. Synnot might sit for a fancy
portrait of Mrs. Grundy. A very tall, lean,
angular, long-faced lady, with refined asceticism
stamped upon her countenance.
Petitioner Synnot is somewhat of a
mystery. He has figured in the spirit as peti-
tioner for two divorces from bis wife, without
once appearing in the flesh. On neither occasion
did he present his somewhat shattered personality
at court.

Revenge, however sweet, often leaves a
bitter taste in the mouth. The conviction of
Oscar Wilde, it would now seem, almost neces-
sarily implies the prosecution and conviction of
Lord Alfred Douglas. Though the Marquis of
Queensberry sought “to save his son from Wilde,”
it is doubtful whether he will contemplate with
much satisfaction the spectac’e of that son being
shot into a British convict prison under the most
unspeakably degrading of all conditions,

Has the omission of articles relating to
unnatural offences in several important recent
European codes, and the consequent “block ” to
the methods of the blackmailer, anything to do
with the apparent increase of professional paede-
rasts, &c., in the last few years in England? But
an authority says there is no increase in numbers
—only in newspaper notoriety.

The public here and elsewhere were very
ready to assume the guilt of Oscar Wilde—who
would bo the very man to be fixed upon as a
“ mark ” for blackmailers. Many will remember
a similar charge brought against Professor Fyffe,
a historian of European, if not world - wide,
fame. A depraved young scoundrel accused him,
for purposes of blackmail, of nameless immorality
in a railway-carriage. The Professor, a nervous
and highly-strung man, foolishly gave a false
name and address when arrested, and still more

foolish’y tried to cut his throat. Subsequently,
everyone cheerfully assumed him guilty, though,

An effort is being made to again boom
Mrs. Mellon, the spiritualistic “meejum.” A
lop-sided spiritist writes a long screed to a
Sydney paper narrating various startling incidents
which occurred in England—all due to Mrs.
Mellon’s marvellous powers. Coming so long after
the Sydney exposure, the object of the letter at
first does not seem plain ; but when it is remem-
bered that this is the beginning of the spirit-seance
season in Australia, some light breaks in upon the
mystery. But when is the long-promised test-
seance to take place ?

During Tasmanian Exhibition time a tourist
“ johnnie ” visited Hobart and consulted an astute
local as to the possibility of obtaining a genuine
pair of old Vandemonian leg-irons. “Oh!’’said
the islander, “ I’ll get them for you ; but they’ll
cost you a couple of quid, and a bottle of beer
thrown in.” Terms were agreed upon, and the
“wild colonial boy’’ at once proceeded to a
friendly blacksmith, who contracted to make the
desired articles for considerably under £2. The
irons (which were so strong that they weighed over
231 b.!) having been “doctored” so as to look
venerable, were handed over to the curiosity-
hunter, who was quite delighted, and is now on

A Queensland country
paper relates how a father
and mother lost their four
children in a single morn-
ing. The wife sent three
of the little ones with their
father’s breakfast to-, a
quarry half-a-rnile distant.
On the way they saw what
they took to be a bird’s
nest in a crevice of sotna
rocks, and two of them put
in their hands for the eggs,
only to be fatally bitten
by a snake. The mi bitten'
child, terror-stricken, ran
home and told his mother,
who endeavoured to put
him on a horse to ride for
a doctor. But in her agi-
tation she lifted the nine-
year-old too far over on
the saddle, and he slipped
to the ground on the other
side, breaking his neck.
The mother then tried
vainly to save the two
snake-bitten children, and
on returning to the house
found that the baby had
fallen into a tub of water
and was quite dead.

dividual hot accustomed to the drug. The im-
punity lasts just as long as the habit is continued,
and no longer. If the supply of arsenic is sud-
denly cut off, then the last dose, or the last few
doses —if they were fatal doses in the ordinary
acceptation of the term— kill the patient; if they
were something less than fatal doses, then they
merely make the patient ill with the ordinary
symptoms of arsenical poisoning. If it happened
that Mrs. Dean had been an arsenic-eater (witli
the knowledge and concurrence of her mother),
what a simple and effective explanation it would
furnish of the whole North Shore mystery ! The
story then would read something like this :
She took her regular allowance of arsenic
and was in good health, so far as all outward
evidences went. Then she was confined, and,
at the same time, her mother was expelled
from the house; consequently, her regular
supply was cut off, and she immediately
fell ill of arsenical poisoning. Her mother was
re-admitted to the house, and the daily drug was
turned on again; consequently, she appeared at
the court in good spirits and the full bloom of
health. Then, owing to a semi-paralytic affection,
she was removed to the hospital, and her supply
of arsenic was cutoff a second time ; consequently,
more arsenical symptoms developed themselves.
The patient herself might be wholly ignorant of
the real state of the case; an arsenic-eater often
knows as little of the real workings of the drug as
anybody else. One thing, at all events, is cer-
tain : the patient exhibited no evidences what?
ever of strychnine-poisoning, so the strychnine
question may be left wholly out of the case for the
present. The beginning, middle and end of the
problem was the alleged arsenical-poisoning, and
when that is explained everything will be definitely
settled, one way or another, so far as Dean is
concerned.

Dr. Lea, of Ringarooma court-martial
fame, who sailed for England in the Ormuz, was
considered in many influential quarters lucky to
have escaped imprisonment. Indeed, were it not
that his presence in a N.S.W. prison might have
created strong popular demonstrations, it is said
he would have been thus punished, in addition to
the other penalties imposed. It may be remem-
bered that certain sailors who, believing their cap-
tain drunk, took command of the ship, were three
years ago sent to gaol in Sydney, and this case
was worked up to prove that Dr. Lea might also
with impunity be similarly dealt with. But dis-
cretion is the better part of valor, and determined
one element in the fate of the unlucky doctor.

Premier Turner is loth to let the trustees
of St. Kilda (Melb.) Cemetery build a crema-
torium, though they have <£7ooo of cash in hand.
Cemetery surpluses belong nominally to the
Government, and a retrenching Treasurer can’t
very well sanction a bakery scheme which offers
no hope of immediate profit. If the trustees could
guarantee a thriving business from the start
Turner might give them leave to proceed, but
cremation requires time to “catch on.” It is
almost settled that the St. Kilda trustees will sell
the right of erecting Melbourne’s first corpse-
refinery to a syndicate. Fifty years hence, when
human burial is a nasty memory of the past,
The Reason.
She liked him, and found certain charms in
His love volcanic,
Though oft it made her leave his arms in
A pleasing panic.
But Fate will follow where Love flies—
He got the sack,
Blank-dashed his bosses, kissed her eyes,
And went out-back.
Meeting again after long weeks,
Upon his shoulder
She sobbed her doubts with tear-wet cheeks
“ Why was he colder?”
“ I love you, darling, more ; more fair I
Now think you look,
Than when we parted ; but back there I
Was my own cook ;
And the long kiss and passion wild
And tender pleading
Of those old times (don’t cry, my child !)
Depends on feeding I”

One of the most depressing spectacles
Sydney has witnessed for many years was the re-
cent big procession of Sunday-school children.
There was nothing particularly cheerful in the
appearance of some thousands of youngsters
bedizened with cholera-morbus-lined bands,
scarves, etc., marching in dejected procession
under garish-looking banners ; but to gaze
upon the anaemic-looking parsons and hard-
faced females who walked beside those
children was enough to strike a chill to
any heart. Nearly all the parsons had
large feet and retreating chins, and
most of the women teachers wore spec-
tacles and an air of stony virtue. For
nearly an hour the mournful cortege
dragged its weary feet past the
corner of King-street in solemn
silence, broken only by the irre-
verent, but pitying, exclamations
of the public that lined the foot-
path. Then a bold-looking girl
with a cheeky eye and a merry
smile came along up from the
wharves with two bluejackets
beside her. Each man had an
arm round her waist, and her hair
was tovvsled. But, upon our con-
demned soul, it was a good sight
to see after that cold, dispiriting
Sunday-school horror.

N.S.W, Govt. Veterinarian Stanley has
found “only five” dairy cows out of several
southern dairy herds, numbering in all 260 beasts,
suffering from tuberculosis. Presuming that the
milk of the herds is mixed ere it goes to market,
the juice of these five tuberculosed cows would be
enough to charge the produce of the whole 260
with the germs of phthisis. In fact, one badly-
infected cow could probably vitiate the milk of 500
healthy ones.

A Western Australian policeman
recently conveyed seven aboriginal
prisoners, chained together, 200 miles.
The niggers tramped all day, and at
night lay down in their “bare pelt,”
without rug or blanket, exposed to
piercingly-cold winds. At the end of
the journey, one man’s lungs were a
mass of inflammation and he died.
The verdict of the jury was “death
from natural causes.” Had the “ trap ”
steeped the nigger in a vat of boiling
oil the intelligent jury would no doubt
have returned the same verdict. But
the policeman is not to blame so much
as the Govt, which permits such
cruelties.

A remarkable snake-yarn from Alpha (Cen-
tral Queensland) railway-station travelled south by
wire. A heroic pointsman was shunning a train
when a large brown snake climbed up the lever
a. 1 across his arm. “ The passengers expected to
see Ewing drop the lever with fright and cause a
wreck of the train, but he coolly held the lever
till the train had safely passed the points.” The
strength of this narrative lies in its picturesque
suggestion of all the passengers happening to look
out of the window when the brown snake was
crawling up the lever. With one swift glance at
the pointsman the eye of the entire human freight
took in the horror of the situation, and everybody
cried : “God help us if he drops the lever!” or
words to that effect. Many a less meritorious
story has got its author crowned as champion liar.

War-artist Villiers has been round N.S. W.
Art Gallery with the S.M. Herald art man, and
has given his opinion,' which, the art man states
triumphantly, backs up that of the S.M. Herald.
It is, indeed, news to find that the Herald ever had
an opinion on anything. Mr. Villiers, it appears,
decided, while “strolling rapidly through the
European Court ’’ (Herald man), that the “Solo-
mon and Sheba” was “indisputably the great
work of the gallery ” (Herald man again). Con-
sidering that the chief proprietor of the Herald
was one of the trustees responsible for the purchase
of the gorgeous fiasco in question (its original price
seemsto have been £6090, which shrank to the£2ooo
ultimately paid by N.S. W.) it would have been
just as well for the paper to say nothing about
the matter. And, as Mr. Villiers is known
to fame, not as a great art-ori ic, nor even as a
great artist, but merely as a well-advertised news-
paper man, who combines black-and-white drawing
and snap-shot-camera business with war corres-
pondence, it would have been just as well if the
Herald had refrained from allowing him to reel
off odious and hastily-made comparisons between
the works of certain Australian artists.

Judge Williams (Vic.) defined habitual
drunkenness during the hearingof a recent divorce-
case. According to his view, the man who gets
drunk regularly once or twice a week is not an
habitual drunkard, unless they are linked and
long-drawn-out—“chain” drunks, so to speak.
To be an habitual drunkard in the eye of the law,
says his Honor, a man must be “substantially
drunk the whole time,” and unless hubby has been
substantially drunk for a fixed period his wife
cannot hope for a divorce on the ground of habi-
tual drunkenness. Yet Judge Williams will
insist there is not one law for the rich and another
for the poor. How many poor but deserving
women can afford to keep their husbands substan-
tially drunk all the time ? It would be just like
some vindictive husbands to sober up at the last
moment.

The Victorian Naval Brigade has been dis"
banded. The men “jibbed” at the last effort o'
retrenchment, and accepted the alternative of
handing over their arms and traps. The Naval
Brigade was unquestionably the finest body of
men in the Vic. military service. The men were
never glaringly obtrusive on the streets, their uni-
forms were not bad for the local eyesight, and the
wearers never wanted to rush off to Africa to kill
niggers for the glory of the Empire. Physically,
the Naval Brigade could wipe the eye of any
other regiment in the country, and the Brigade
was an excellent sample of the sort of protectors
Australia should go in for when she can be certain
in training soldiers that they are for home con-
sumption solely.

At a down-country Tas. saw-mill township
a hoary-headed old sinner lately appeared before
the bench charged with assaulting a little girl.
The evidence showed the offence to be of a gross
nature ; and the bench, with that sense of the fit-

magistracy, sent the offender to gaol for one
month, remarking that “ had he been a single
man his sentence would have been much heavier.”

SOME ST. ALBAN’S CHRONICLES.
Robinson Crusoe, one of the sires at St. Alban’s,
who is still strong and hearty, was not named
until after the disastrous voyage of the City of
Melbourne, in September 1876. It was calculated
that about £15,000 worth of horse stock was lost
on that o 'cession—the only equine survivors being
the Chrysolite colt and Red wood—the former
was carried ashore. He was appropriately named
Robinson Crusoe, and after a month or two
recovered completely, although he still bears the
marks of the battering he received.
# # •
During the gale in which the City of Mel-
bourne’s steering-gear went wrong, Bancroft, a
sst. 71b. jockey, was on deck and managed to
secure a tootli of Nemesis, who had just won the
A.J.C. Metropolitan. Bancroft is now in Mel-
bourne.
• • •
During the last ten years only two snakes have
been seen on the St. Alban’s estate. This is
peculiar as, owing to the luxuriant growth, there
is ample shelter for reptiles. Much amusement
has been caused by the gingerly way in which
visitors move through the prairiegrass and lucerne.
Mr. “Jack” Stephenson, of Dunedin, holds the
record for 50 yards, but it was a false start. Alfred
Samuels, however, is the long-distance champion
—twice round the track before breakfast after a
late night.
* # *
Leslie Macdonald, the superintendent at St.
Alban’s, although still a young man, has narrowly
missed making his fortune on several occasions.
He had sole management of First Water when he
ran second to Martini-Henry in the Melbourne
Cup. First Water was backed for .£BO,OO0 —Tom
Barnfield, of Adelaide, could have bathed in
sovereigns if he had got home.
# « •
When John Orozier had St. Alban’s it was fore-
told he would be a failure, but what with careful
management and judicious picking of doubles,
John is supposed to have cleared out with £50,000
to the good. He now resides at Glenelg, near
Adelaide, and may be seen any day interviewing
the trainer of a likely Cup candidate, or giving
the girls a treat on the pier.

James Wilson, the original proprietor of St.
Alban’s, is a Yorkshireman, self-educated, and
would, and will even now, sit up to the small
hours of the morning studying pedigrees and
ancient racing lore. One day “Jim ” was lunge-
ing a colt when he heard a voice from over a fence
asking him why he didn’t do it properly. “Jim ”
looked up in astonishment at the audacity of any-
one daring to admonish him. It proved to be the
parson of the local church, and when he explained
how they “ did those things in Yorkshire,” he
won old Jim’s heart and left, after being well cared
for, with a fiver for his church.

One of the pleasantest outings possible for Mel-
bournians is to join the house party at St. Alban’s
during the Geelong race week—Japanese cooking,
a look at the yearlings, a bracing walk through
the mares and foals, and a good bed goes a long
way towards gladdening the average human heart.

“Bob” Orr, or “Bill” Bailey, and “Jim”
Scobie always come down from Ballarat on these
occasions. “ Bob ” was once shown a raw colt as
a Derby candidate —he turned away in disgust,
saying, “ Mon, hae ye ever seen Dreamland ?”

Alban’s estate appear in this issue.
Mr. Nathan Herman, of the Misfit Par-
lours, No. 9 VVyuyard-street, Sydney—the place
where the big banner is, and where the immense
“ 9 ” looks like a frozen boa-constrictor over the
door, and the huge lamp serves as a beacon to
guide the wandering footsteps of the pilgrim from
the bush—has vastly increased his business within
the last few weeks. A mammoth new depart-
ment has been added for the sale of furniture,
crockery, pianos, bedding, ironmongery, &c., and
the young man who is going to get married, and
be afterwards run in on his mother-in-law’s evi-
dence, can here find absolutely everything that
he wants. A new feature of the jewellery depart-
ment is the reliable watch, with gilt chain
which looks like gold—all for 6s. 6d. The
misfit tobacco and cigar department has been
greatly enlarged, and all kinds of plugs are
now supplied. Herman’s tea is a wonderful
speciality. The dress and mantle department has
also greatly expanded, and a large staff of ladies—
most of them young and beautiful—are kept on
hand to make all necessary alterations while you
wait. Sundry large shipments of Brussels
carpets have arrived, and are being sold at 2s. a
yard, with no charge whatever for making and
laying ; and various consignments of rugs,
blankets, boots, shoes, overcoats, waterproofs,
&c., &c., are being sold at the same ruinous
rates. Also, the four winds which blow in
the halls of heaven continue to bring in
orders from everywhere for the famous £2 parcel,
which includes a suit of clothes, two boiled shirts,
two under-shirts, six pairs of socks, two ties, two
collars, six handkerchiefs —no person with the
kind of cold which prevails just now can get
through with less than six—set of studs, hat, pair
braces and a pair of boots. The said orders, each
with remittance attached, now average 100 daily,
and many letters expressing the satisfaction of
the purchasers can be seen at the office. A huge
consignment of misfits in every branch of clothing,
and bought at merely nominal prices, has just
been received per Orotava, and Mr. Herman is
shortly starting for Europe to make contracts fur
the purchase of all misfits from the leading tailors
of London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Paris, Vienna,
and other cities. When this arrangement is com-
pleted he calculates that the business will be the
most extensive of its kind south of the line.
Meanwhile, an additional elevator is being put in,
and the trade is already slopping over far beyond
the limits of the original premises, and Mr. Her-
man is concocting schemes for absorbing the whole
block from George-st right down to York-st.


The human body is a victim to those
dreadful enemies, the microbes, and to prevent
those treacherous foes to approach you there is no
better method than to keep yourself clean and not
allow food to decay in your mouth or the clogging
of the epidermis. To prevent these things, one of
the most leading chemists in Sweden brought out
his world-renowned Amykos, which, without
doubt, is the best toilet requisite with which to
srargle your throat, wash your mouth and face.
Amykos is strongly recommended as a preventa-
tive of sore throat and bad breath.

846 Maequarie-sfcreet North, Sydney,
May 28, 1895.
My Dkae Mookabinda—
The Queen’s Birthday parade was this year a
very attenuated sort of proceeding. Acting-Gov.
Darley and General Hutton put one moiety of
the forces through their facings on the University
Park, while Admiral Bridge reviewed the local
naval forces on the Domain. If we were rolling
in warriors (to use a figure of speech) it might be
wise to deconcentrate the forces, but while our
possibly brave defenders are almost reduced to
the shifts of the theatrical super, who has to keep
on running across the stage to suggest the idea of
numbers, it seems a pity not to bunch ’em all
together and give ’em a chance spectacularly.
There was a good-sized crowd in University
Park —selected as the scene of the gun-banging,
despite the proximity of the unhappy Alfred Hospi-
tal patients. People like to follow Gen. Hutton
round, for he is a most original potentate, and
nobody ever knows what will happen next. For
example, at the Eister encampment, as the
General was riding down the line of Lanceahs he
came to one unwarlike warrior with a shook of
hair like a bulrush-tuft. At this unbarbered
object the General (whose own grizzled curls are
not perhaps so short as they might be) gazed with
visible disapproval, and slowly whistling the
music-hall tune, “Gityer ’air cut,” he passed on
his way amid the laughter of the regiment.
A Sydney book-seller (who keeps no index-ex-
purgatorius on his premises) had an experience the
other day which serves to illustrate the fact that
no true woman of the world ever personally en-
quires for a book with a title which may be
variously interpreted. It is like a person ordering
a soda and resenting the insult if the waiter brings
it along duly splintered ! The lady in question,
wife of a very well-advertised personage, asked
for the work in a manner which was misinter-
preted by the shopman, with the result that a
neatly-bound parcel marked “Holy Living and
Dying ” was handed out to her. The same day
hubby, cane in hand, burst into the sanctum of
the book-vendor and threatened him wich condign
punishment for selling an equivocal book to his
innocent spouse, who didn’t want that sort of
volume at all.
Judging from the evidence in a recent case, it
would really appear that certain coffee-palaces,
founded to promote the strictest teetotal virtue,
resolutely suppress wine only to encourage the
appearance of women upon the scenes. A
system seems to have been organised by
couples not properly consolidated for blinding the
eyes of the virtuous management to their little
romance. To give a honeymoon-air to their
arrival, each sports a brand-new, but, alas ! merely
papier-mache portmanteau, or a Gladstone bag,
which can be obtained for a few shillings not
far from the particular caravanserai which this
story concerns. Into these flimsy, make-believe
receptacles “the guilty pair ” put stones, etc., to
suggest a great rush of clothing apiece; and they
almost invariably leave the portmanteau behind on
departing. The amusing consequence is that the
management lately traded back “ in one parcel ”
no less than 74 of these Gladstone bags on to the
man who originally sold them.
Apropos of the Dean Commission, the evidence
given by a publicaness concerning a call made at
her hotel by a strange lady who had mixed wines
and ale with disastrous stomachic effect, proves
what a bad friend woman is to woman. “ How
do I look?” said the visitor. “Oh, all right,”
replied the publicaness—who confessed in her
evidence: “Though I said that, I didn’t really
think so.” What a touch of nature ! No woman
can ever be relied on to give another woman an
honest opinion as to personal appearance. It is
always her husband to whom a woman appeals to
know if her hat’s on straight, and I have fre-
quently seen a woman, after being warmly encour-
aged as to the tilt of her head-gear by a sister
soul, go up close to the looking-glass, and, after
scanning herself suspiciously, end by sticking in
another pin.
Lord Glasgow, just now Governor of Maori-
land, is the latest peer to whom rumor assigns the
N.S.W. Governorship, which certainly does look
as if it was being “ hawked about.” But I hope
it’s only the same old canard, for people want
something fresh-caught, if only for curiosity’s
sake. I believe the Glasgows are rather commend-
able as vice-regalities go, and pilgrims from here
to Maoriland tell such glowing tales of how
friendly “the Countess” was to them at her
garden-parties that it almost looks as if the Tattoo-
land vice-regalities had one eye on the refusal of a
possible Australian billet. But nobody wants to
have them passed on, all the same. 3uoh things
bring affairs of state to the level of a boarding-
house break fast-table : “May I trouble you to
pass Lord Tommy Dodd ?” or “ After you with
the Duke of Plaza Toro.”
But, meanwhile, it would appear, from the glit-
tering success of the Darley regime at Govern-
ment House, that we might possibly grow our own
Brahmins. The stately Acting-Governor and his
wife, besides looking the part, also understand the
acting vice-regal position to a nicety, though this
is only the second time they have capped the social
Olympus. Of course it is “all hacting,” as
Gourlay used to say, but it is very convincing act-
ing, you must admit, and sometimes a good deal
more to the point than the genuine article. For
instance, an Acting-Governoress isn’t so high and
haughty that she can decline to open a small
suburban bazaar, even if she wanted to decline ;
nor is she so ’umble that she cannot refuse to be a
sister to Mrs. Tanglefoot should the occasion
arise; also, she has the clear advantage of know-
ing “ who is who” without relying on the evidence
of a clique torn with personal motives. Altogether,
a “leader of society ” chosen on the spot would
not be without advantages over the vapourish
stranger who listens with mild amaze and acts
upon the information instantly when Mrs. Gin-
sling solemnly warns her that Mrs. Threestars
has kep’ a public-’ouse—a farce which really
happened not a dozen “reigns ” ago.
There was much howling and gnashing of teeth,
I hear, over the farewell address to Lady Duff.
The movement had “a strong committee,” of
course, and every woman thereon felt sure she
would be chosen to go into the Presence holding
on to the fringe at the edge of the address. But,
in the end, the three ringleaders were somehow
elected to that office and enjoyed all to themselves
whatever glory attached to handing over “We,
the women of N.S. W.,” or whatever it was. How-
ever, Lady Duff must have been thankful to avoid
being hustled by a horde of strange women in her
desolate abode. Thanks to her medicine man,
who kept her “indisposed” until her departure,
and forbade effusive farewells, Lady Duff may
congratulate herself on being probably the first
Governoress to get away from Sydney without
having to put her right hand in a sling.
Talking of Governors’ wives (we Australians
can only talk of—not to them, nowadays—for
there isn’t one left on the whole Australian main-
land), I hear that the last three Bananaland
potentatesses have, to a great extent, shunned
the local frookist and her works, likewise the
aboriginal milliner, just as if no good sartorial
thing could possibly come out of Brisbane. How-
ever, I don’t think this need dishearten the pin-
and-needle brigade. As a person who believes in
Australia, I am rather glad to have the oppor-
tunity to announce, in a loud voice, that none of
her “subjects” had the horror of making the
boiled-tea-leaf garment which Her Northern Ex-
cellency sported in Melbourne last Cup. Apropos
of dressmakers, it amuses me —in all the ’Stralian
cities—to see it announced : “ Miss O’Nooligan,
costumiers (this word is nearly always wrongly
snelt), late of London and Paris.” But she must
have picked up her French in London.
The Fresh Air League ball committee is get-
ting up more steam every day for its fast-
approaching hop in Sydney Town Hall. The
Factory Girls’ Club ball (which, I believe, has
taken much pains over its committee) has Mrs.
Douglas Mackenzie for its secretary, and has
quite made up its mind to be a crowded success.
On 14th June the Diphtheria-hospital-piano ball
takes place at Need’s rooms, and the Tempe ball
committee has no misgivings whatever when
it thinks of the 24th July. Talking of fixtures,
I would like to again remind people of the
Madame Soldene matinee, at Sydney Lyceum, on
sth June, which will be well worth going to for
its own sake as well as the beneficiary’s.
The exhibition of curios in aid of the Women’s
College (which is abhorred throughout the Uni-
versity proper, and keeps professors and students
handing out a “ small donation,” until everybody
is almost stone-broke) is still running merrily, and
is perhaps the most novel show, so far, got up to
keep the huge incubus on its unnecessary feet.
By the way, I heard one or two storyettes re some
of the women who exploited the polite suburbs,
begging jewellery from the chatelaine’s box and
priceless pictures from her walls with charming
aplomb. Two of them went to a woman whose
pictures certainly are her strong point. “Oh!
lend us that ! ” chirped one, pointing ecstatically
to the worst frame in the room. “You mustn’t
point,’’ said her friend, severely, “what would pa
say?” But, in a few moments, this stern censor
of deportment was up on a chair, with her two
muddy heels planted firmly in the plush cushion,
scanning the work of art. I wonder what pa
would have thought of that?
In another house the hostess allowed two of the
“collectors” to choose their own pictures—but
when the frames arrived at the exhibition imagine
the chagrin of the borrowers to find that the
lender (a woman of some taste) had forwarded not
one of the canvases chosen ! “They hit upon the
worst I had in the house !” she explained, “and
as I really couldn’t let the public think I was
proud of those things I sent my own fancy.”
The Women’s College Exhibition is a good idea
well staged. Such exhibitions are sure to multiply,
as they enable people to parade the magnificence
of their possessions. To show a shaving-brush
belonging to Napoleon enables you, as it were, to
barnacle yourself on to the Little Corporal, and the
lady who lets it be known that she has Marie
Antoinette’s handkerchief always impresses you
with the notion that she and the decapitated
queen hung on the same family tree. Such a
gorgeous opportunity for tail-spreading never was,
and I predict that the historical-relic exhibition
will catch on frantically in Australia as a pastime
eminently calculated to give society an aesthetic
hoist. Though most peoplearescepticalaboutrelics,
which offer too wide a field for deceptions to be
swallowed whole ; still, it certainly does impress
you to read in the papers about the silver snuff-
box belonging to Mr. De Smith’s grandfather,
when it was the current impression that he never
had one. lam not going to catalogue the show—
that has been done in the dailies, in a style peril-
ously near the ludicrous. For instance: “Mrs.
Blank Blank’s serviette, used by Charles Edward
in 1745” (vide S.M.H.), trembles on the verge of
the ridiculous, don’t you think ? Such a relic, too,
might be easily copied, but any ladies who strive,
by devious means, to rival Mrs. B. B. in her
possession of royal napery, must be careful not to
date the damask too far back—to some savage
potentate who invariably wiped his hands on his
hair.
The most impressive thing in the show was a
portion of a suit of mail—the headpiece. The
good old tin hat looked lonely in Australia, espe-
cially all by itself —it looked as if the mailed
ancestor had worn himself not only down to the
knees in coming across the seas, but up to the
neck as well. Tin armour thus far from battle-
fields merely suggests the property-room. There
was rather a taking show of good lace, and the
display of china and glass was charming. For
instance, one Venetian vase in red with the most
exquisitely-worked flounce of Venetian point-lace
(done in glass) draped round it; and a cameo vase
—turquoise blue with an ethereal white pattern.
There was a jumble of interesting oddments, and
the committee could have filled a much larger
hall, as the pressure on their advertising—l mean
exhibiting—space was something enormous. It
was interesting to notice how most of the exhibi-
tors went to Europe for their “historical”
mementoes; very few seemed to have carefully-
preserved relics of—er —Captain Cook.
From W. H. Paling and Co. I have received
some new music, including “ Her Lad Across the
Sea,” by Milton Wellings, which will not enjoy
the success obtained by the same composer’s rage
of long ago, “ Golden Love.’’ For one thing, no
lady under forty could possibly sing it with any
degree of empressement, and any young person
standing up and vocally remarking that her “old
heart is aching, aching ” in a fresh young voice
would not be an artistic success. For aged and
infirm vocalists, however, the song has no faults.
“The Sentinel,” a baritone song by Fred Burry,
reminds me of whisky and water —the bolero part
is the whisky and the waltz part is the other thing
—it also reminds you of the lion lying down with
the lamb, and various other things one-half of
which are highly complimentary when used in
metaphor. “Until the Eventide,” by Frank
Down, is a very promising mezzo-soprano song in
five flats, which would sound effective if prettily
sung, though the orthography is shaky. “Where
the hum of insects mingels ” is the way one line
runs, for instance. The list of songs closes with
“A Proposal,” by J. Ivory. Is it high art
which makes this alluringly-named alleged song
so reminisoency of “Caller Herrin’,” “Molly
Darling,” and “In the Gloaming?” It is a
youth proposing, so perhaps this weird, familiar
jumble is typical of the feelings of a man on his
knees who feels old memories of similar episodes
stealing o’er him as he pops once more. If this is
so, Mr. Ivory is indeed a genius.
I am really surprised at “The Boys Waltz,”
by Ernest Truman. That a Continentally-trained
and really expert musician should write such
dreary platitudes is possible—but that he should
print them is inconceivable. “ The Boys ”is not
dance music, it is “pour piano.’’ Poor piano
indeed. I rather like “The Patricia’’ waltz,
dedicated actually to Lady Carington (this is
fame, if you like) by F. G. Burry. It is a good
dancing number, easy, bright and melodious all
through.
The B. and B. notion of eliminating Oscar
Wilde’s name from their bills must pale its in-
effectual fires before the action of a clutch of
N.S. W. amateurs who recently rehearsed the
operetta “Patience” to a pitch of (amateur) per-
fection, and then suddenly altered the bill. On
being requested to give a reason, they calmly con-
fessed that it was all owing to the fact that Oscar
Wilde had been the original Bunthorne. Of such
are the “provinces.”
In “A Shop Girl,” writes my Melb. corres-
pondent, just after Blanche Massey has com-
pletely captivated you with a fairy-like creation
of cream foulard, sprinkled over with violets, and
befrilled round the foot in a fascinating way with
tiny ruches of violet, green and yellow, she re-
appears, more bewitching still, in glossy pink
satin with a coronet of pearls on her golden head.
Maude Hobson, who shows off her clothes magni-
ficently, appears clad in shimmering yellow satin,
with a cape covered with Honiton lace, and a
priceless sable pelerine thrown across her shoulders.
Deciraa Moore made the most winsome of tiny
shop-girls in black moire antique, and, in the
second act, looks like a gitana off a raisin-box, in
black covered with gold gauze over dessous of
scarlet silk. Both Grace Palotta’s gowns are of
white satin. The first, a walking-dress, is veiled
with coarse guipure and is finished with waistband
and neckband of black velvet with which she wears
a fetching picture hat of black straw. Her white
satin evening-gown has prodigious sleeves (by the
way, G.P. all through the season has stuck
to the fact that huge sleeves are still the only
wear) and an “organ-pipe” back (the fearfully-
cumbersome “organ-pipe,” too, has evidently
come to stay), and she wears a wreath of scarlet
roses. During her raan in-the-moon song (no con-
nection with any other song of the same name) the
stage is darkened and moonlighty-blue lime-light
is thrown on her. The effort is charming but some-
what ghostly.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
SPORTING NOTIONS.
When Dooley and Felix, the Sydney heavy-
weight pugs., were last week charged before the police-
court with proposing to engage in a prize-fight, it was
loudly explained that the pair were only to spar “ for
points.” The point of the jaw.

The price of a certain rather distinguished
amateur goal kicker to strip again for his old love is £6
a week, not a penny less, though his old club pleaded
poverty. If this is an amateur, what’s a pro. ? Another
“amateur” refused (at the last moment before a recent
big match) to strip under £3. £2 10s. was unavailingly
offered.

The great “Tracker” Forbes, the Essendon
football god, will, it is announced, play no more, having
developed a “ leg.” Another national calamity.

The “ Bloodger ” is the latest occupation of the
used-up pug. in Melb.—and elsewhere. Arrangements
can be made for an enemy being half-killed. Fees
moderate.
« * • •
The latest. Man meets you, and shows you
wire from (say) Hales or Soobie, “ hack Bottler ; ” shows
also an Ikey Moses ticket 20 to 1, and advises you to go
and do likewise. Ikey Moses being a “safe” man, you
lay out a fiver with him—and lose. Wire bogus. Bookie
pays your friend a commission.

Old Billy Oaffyn, the world-renowned cricketer,
has settled down as a barber, “ a penny-shave,” at Hert-
ford, Eng. Poor Caffyn had the ball at his foot in Sydney,
but he let the chance slip, and the cards never forgive.
He has ever since been on the down-grade. What a
smart fellow he was in his time! Charley Lawrence is
another who missed his chance of making a fortune. The
Albert Club stuck to him well, but he lacked business
capacity.

A game and gory 53-round bare-knuckle mill
delighted 40 Zeehan (Tas.) sports one recent morning.
Albury Clifford, a 23-year-old stripling, barely scaling
10st., took on Alf. James, a strapping 13st. miner. It
was a go-as-you-please, kicking barred, and productive of
much blood-spilling. After the eighth round Clifford
had the punching all his own way, and downed his
opponent repeatedly. James, although badly beaten,
refused to “turn it up” until completely blinded by
blood; he was a sorry spectacle of a lashed chopping-
block, while Clifford (merely an alias) escaped with a few
bruises and a broken hand. When not aggressive, the
victor is a hairdresser, and hails from Essendon (Vic.).
He is now the recognised champion knocker-out of Tas.
* * * ♦
Essendon, though defeated by Melb., is com-
ing again, and with Thurgood’s return should reverse
matters. Their match with Norwood (S.A.)on Friday ex-
hibited the best football seen this season.

Last Saturday night at Nathan’s, Melb., God-
dard looked extremely well, and in two rounds of what
was to be a ten-round affair, very effectually disposed of
Dan Keely. The 26 per cent, “gateage” was poor pay
for the punching Daniel got.
♦ ♦ • *
If the last two Saturdays’ Sydney football play
is any criterion, then Pirates and Randwick appear to have
about an equal chance for the badges, and the 'Varsity
and Wallaroos to be out of it. Unless some radical
reversal of form takes place Pirates should win this year’s
honors, with Randwick runners up.

A great drawback to Rugby football in Melo.
is the evident prejudice which the daily papers have
against it. It is with the greatest difficulty that they
are persuaded to publish a one-inch notification of forth-
coming fixtures, while the other game, including the
doings of “Chopper ” So-and-So and “Tracker” Blank,
gets columns of space. They will not print an accouiu
of an important Rugby match, and it is averred that
during the visit of the N.S.W. team last year one leading
daily actually refused to send a reporter to the inter-
provincial game unless paid to do so.

Father v. sou was a contingency never contem-
plated by the Qneensberry rules. Yet we have the

A detective, who owns a couple of racing ponies
and runs them in somebody else’s name, is one of the
anomalies of Sydney police force. Another D. bets “on
the nod ”at a tote shop. “And, hang him,” says the
tote man, “ if he’d only back winners I wouldn’t mind,
because I could keep his stakes out of the divvies, but he
backs losers and I’ve got to put up the blessed googies to
keep the tote straight.”

Dear Bulletin, —I heard a racing man ask the
other day re recent S. A. prosecutions: “ Why, shouldn’t
the bookmakers be allowed to lay the totalisator odds?”
Well, one reason why—l was put up to the wrinkle in
Maoriland. Bookie gets to know two stiff ’uns in a field
of six —perhaps the owners let him have them “in the
kit ” for a consideration. Well, he lays the odds to, say,
£2OO, £4O of which is on the dead ’uns. Of course, lie
doesn’t take any risks; he puts the £l6O invested with
him on the triers on the tote and neither wins nor loses
on them, but the £4O on the two prads with Mr. Arm-
strong up is found money. No bookmaker can honestly
afford to lay totalisator odds.

One important point about American cycling is
the machine. Sanger, who took Zimmerman's place in
the amateur ranks, is a hig-honed, heavy man of six feet,
yet lie races on an 181 b. machine. Megson, the N.S.W.
crack, who is sft. 9in., and two or three stone less weight
than Sanger, races on a 221 b. machine. Fancy delving on
a 41b. heavier machine alongside of a pacer like Zimmer-
man, who passes through brilliant men finishing a race as
an arrow passes through the air.

There are ten lacrosse clubs playing in Adelaide
this year. The Canadian game is making big strides in
S.A., and as the game has also reached the colleges the
football clubs begin to regard lacrosse as a serious rival.
Apparently it progresses much quicker in Adelaide than in
Melb. or Sydney.

Parramatta the dismal, on Queen’s Birthday,
held a cycling carnival. Proceedings opened with drizz-
ling rain and closed under a steady pour. The track is
fast and true, of hardened cinder ; its fault is its narrow-
ness. Its existence is due to O’Brien, local representative
of the Austral Cycle Agency. He began his bright career
three years ago, and one of his earliest successes was
getting the Park authorities to lay down this track.
There was no pavilion, and so people could get
as wet in the reserve for 2s. as in the ground itself for
half the money. Megson was not there, but all the rest
of the N.S.W.'cracks were ; others came from Qoulburn,
young, West Maitland and Victoria.
Half-a-dozen men entered for the ten-mile cham-
pionship of N.S.W. For the first few laps single riders
did the pacing, and Matterson, the ex-sculler, was shout-
ing for more speed. Then Elliot and M'Ooombe dashed
in front on a tandem, and red-hot pacing began. At the
16th lap only Lewis, O'Brien, and Matterson were left in,
and in that order. They’ raced along with a whirr and
rush of air that threw up the fallen dead leaves, and by
the 20th lap Matterson cried enough. Then for the 20
laps more, the tandem flew on, with Lewis a foot behind
it, and O’Brien a foot behind Lewis, on whom the pace
told. When a lap and a-h,ilf remained the tandem drew
ofif, and the finish began. A lap from home O’Brien dashed
to the front, and, though Lewis struggled hard, O’Brien
won a grand race with a good deal to spare.
The final of the Parramatta Wheel Race pro-
duced a fine contest. The distance was eight laps. At
the fourth lap the seven riders were in a bunch ; at the
sixth, Freeman saw his chance and rushed to the lead.
The field kept close upon him, and when half a lap from
home he tried to spurt away, Matterson and Birtles came
with a determined rush. Heck and neck the three raced
home. Twenty yards from the winning-post Matterson
led by a foot, then Freeman made a supreme effort and
won upon the post. The first prize was £ls, and is Free-
man’s first win for 18 months. Like Matterson, he is a
sculler; he has, as an oarsman, represented N.S.W. four
times against Vic.
The mile test-race last Saturday to decide which
Sydney man should represent N.S.W. in Victoria, was
contested in rain, wind, and mud. O’Brien did not want
to race and pointed out that the track was dangerous.
The tandem team tried to pace, but drew off after half a
lap. To ride on the track its riders said w'as to come
down. At the third lap Lewis fell, and O’Brien and
,Vl‘limes, splashed with mud, completed the course. The
race was easily O’Brien’s, who, in his present form, is pro-
bably second only to Megson.

Despite adverse weather, the S.T.C. Birthday
meeting on Friday and Saturday last provided some first-
rate racing. The successes of Mr. S. Hordern with
Hindoo and Ooolalta were well received, and the latter
may be found next September capable of securing classic
honors for his owner. Three-quarter brother to the un-
f irtunate Oamoola, Ooolalta (Abercorn— Copra) is well
e mugh bred for anything.

Gold cheek ! The V.R.O. committee waited on
the Vic. Railway Commissioners the other day to request
that reduced fares should be charged for journeys to Mel-
bourne from the country when race-meetings are held at
Flemington. The V.R.O. evidently regards horse-racing
as a Great National Industry which has a right to be
encouraged by the State.
The surprise of the Birthday meeting at Rand-
wick was the last minute’s Cup lush on the giant Atlas
(by Cranbrook), who started an equal favorite with
Ruenalf, and, taking command on entering the straight,
never left the issue in doubt, winning by three lengths
from Nobleman.

A fashionably-bred youngster, True Blue, by
Hotchkiss—Rose of Wellington, ran a good fifth with 7st.
101 b. up in the Royal Stakes, and, as he is handsome as

the A. J.O. and V.R.O. Derbies.

At Tatt.’s meeting to-day (Saturday) Mr.
Oxenham has with Solatium a good chance of repeating
his last year’s Pilot Boy trick-i.e., winning Flying and
.Winter handicaps. Mr. Kelso should also be very
dangerous with his string, and to these two prominent
members of the club, perhaps, the main prizes of the
meeting will fall. , * •
Mr. Henry, hon. sec. of the English Life-saving
Society, intimates that he is searching for information re
Australia’s claim that the world-famed over-arm side-
stroke originated among the aborigines of this country,
and not in England as heretofore understood. A Mr.
Wallace is said to claim the stroke as an Australian mven-
tiou • bufc a Bulletin correspondent, some months ago,
very clearly showed by an extract from Gatlin that the
over-arm stroke was used long ago among certain Ameri-
can Indian tribes.

The statement that W. R. Wilson had sent
bundles of complimentary tickets for the St. Alban s
lottery to the virious newspaper offices of Australia was a
spiteful fiction, circulated, in the first place, by a
journalist who had heard of another journalist being
favored with a few tickets from Mr. W., and would have
liked to stand in his “ brother pressman s boots. Wilson
has found it a rather annoying statement. He can t look
at a sporting publication of the smallest pretensions with-
out finding a sarcastic paragraph to the effect that the
parcel of tickets addressed to the editor of the rag in
question must have been lost in transit. It seems that
the “ St. Alban’s lottery,” or whatever one likes tocallib,
is an utterly uncalled-for proceeding. The duty of V. R.
Wilson was clear. He should have distributed his breed-
ing stud among the various horse-reporters of this hemis-
phere in a friendly way—one horse for each reporter—and,
as regards the St. Alban’s estate, they ought to have been
requested to raffle that desirable freehold property among
themselves. . *

The g.g. Pickles, who won both the Autumn
and Bayview handicaps, at Williainstown, last Saturday,
is about the best pony racing in Melb. just now. He
comes from N.S.W., and sometime ago some Oootaraundra
sports attempted matching a local pony with the grey
for £IOO a-side. The Fiokles people, not thinking it good
enough, stood off. Now the Oootaraundra pony is about
to visit Melb. m
Mr. Charles Balwin, of Manilla, Tamworth
fN S W.) has imported the well-bred English horse.
Nobleman, a fair performer, and interesting as one of
Abington Baird’s presents to Mrs.^ Langtry.
The American anti-gamblers are gradually driv-
ing all sporting men to London, where Poxall Keene is
forming a big stable. # ‘
The next team of Australian cricketers, remarks
Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent, are bke y to re-
ceive a little more civility and attention from the M-o.a
Mia,. Hipv experienced daring the visits of the last two
teams th as Lord Jersey has joined the committee, vice that
psalnvsinging individual, A. J. Webbe, who for some
reasons best knowm to himself, has a great down on
Australians, and has done all that he can to crab them m
England it will be remembered that he declined to take
part in any game against the last team, and he induced
others to follow suit. He and the Walkers are strong at
Lord's and can (or could) there do pretty well what they
like, but under the new committee things will alter. All
the Middlesex, men are arrant tuft-hunters, and won’t
think of setting themselves up against Jersey, who is
one of the aristocrats of England and immensely-
powerful socially—as he really deserves to be. It has always
puzzled me to account for Webbe’s prejudice against the
“ colonials,” for no man received more attention or ex-
perienced greater kindness than he in Australia when he
came out with Harris’ team of expensive amateurs. And
none of them has shown less appreciation of it.
The third edition of the pamphlet on
Sharp’s new Cannalin remedies for piles is now
ready—free copies on application to the depot for
Australasia, 257 George-street, Sydney. Note. —
These remedies have cured where operation and
all other means have failed.*
Restaurateur Rubira, Melb., had a forced
levy on him of about .£20 through people going
without lunches on hospital self-denial day, and
| the tobacconists averaged pounds apiece, while it
fell heavier on the butchers than anyone. When
you rob Peter to pay Paul, it doubtless encourages
Paul, but it is mighty discouraging to Peter.
The serious business of the Michael Davitt
Me 1 b. reception was preceded by a lively farce.
The floor of the Hibernian Hall is frequently used
for dances, and is consequently waxed. On the
reception evening some sawdust had been sprinkled
over it; nevertheless, when the crowd rushed in
pell-mell the scene was like a skating school.
Women and men sprawled over the floor in all
directions, amidst the hysterics of the privileged
females packed in the balcony.
A correspondent:— “The Bulletin men-
tions that ‘T. Hansen,’ Australian art student,
who baa managed to have two of his pictures
exhibited in the Paris Salon, is the son of a
Sydney medico. I think you are mistaken here.
This is probably, in Melb. opinion, Theo. B.
Hansen, son of a Box Hill (Vic.) land-agent, who
was, while a pupil of F. B. M’Cubbin, at Melb.
National Gallery, generally considered a youth of
great promise. Hansen is a clever draughtsman
and a good strong painter, and the weakness of
perspective observable in his Australian pictures
would be corrected by a few years’ study. He
left Melb. with ‘Jimmy ’ Quinn, the winner of the
last travelling scholarship, when the latter set out
for Paris.” [It is the Melb. Hansen.—Ed. B.]
“ Crom-a-boo,” the irresistibly funny and
rollicking Irish song of the Hoben Brothers, which
Sappho Smith opined would prove “ a terrible
success,” is already proving. Lonnen has taken
it up in London, and Lauri is to sing it in
Australia ; it is to be well introduced in America,
and in Maoriland. where that clever comedian,
Percy, of the Pollard Lilliputians, is making a
feature of it. It is also a universal success and
heard everywhere. Paling’s have already cleared
the first big edition, and have got out two others
in E flat and F. It is certainly the funniest Irish
football-song ever written, and the press every-
where has risen to describe it as the best comic
song of the day, and funnier than “Killaloe ” or
“ Ballyhooley.” It is just the thing tor an aspir-
ing comique, pro. or amateur.*
Parkes and Dibbs, erstwhile rival political
leaders, have buried (or are trying to bury) the
hatchet—in the skull of N.S. Wales. No dog
who has a bone is ever very friendly with the
other dog that is smelling round, and so they had
not spoken to one another for years—they had
only growled and barked. When the two great
men met, the other day, after their long estrange-
ment, “ George ” was reclining on a sofa (lying
is a rude word) apparently waiting for his
new and distinguished colleague. “A few pro-
minent members of the Opposition were also pre-
sent. Upon Henry slowly entering the room of
his adopted party George sprang from the sofa.
Henry advanced to the Protectionist apostle, and,
extending his hand to George, gave utterance to
these pregnant words, ‘Good morning, Sir George ;
how are you? It is a long time since we have
spoken to one another ; indeed, it is a longer
time since we have shaken hands. I hope
you will allow the past to be buried.’ Dibbs
cheerfully responded : ‘ Good morning, Sir
Henry. Well, I’m pleased to welcome you to this
room. As for the personal differences we have
had in the past, I wipe that away for ever,’
George accompanied the latter words with appro-
priate and picturesque gestures. Again welcom-
ing Henry to the protectionist room, the two one-
time political antagonists gazed earnestly into
each other’s eyes, and the reconciliation was com-
plete.” The reporter does not say whether when
they “looked into each other’s eyes” they
winked, but very likely they did. “Shortly after-
wards the two wily gentlemen proceeded to the
breakfast-room and breakfasted together.”

“ That which we call a rose, by any other
name would smell as sweet,” and so it
happens that we want to explain what
Is MYFA? It is only a name,
the new name for Mitchell’s
“My Favorite” Tea. Why do
we change the name ? Simply to
protect you from fraud. The success of
“My Favorite ” Tea has been
gigantic; its immense popularity is so
pronounced that it has numbers of imita-
tors already, who have neither the brains
nor the inclination to get an original
name of their own
A recent decision of the Supreme Court has revealed the fact that the
words “ My Favorite ” can be used by anybody, and we have therefore, in
order to prevent your being misled into buying “ Favorite ” Tea, and
thinking it the celebrated blend of Mitchell’s, decided to change the name
for one that cannot be held by anyone else. .
MITCHELL’S “MY FAVORITE” Tea will be sold in future under the
name of MYFA TEA (copyright).
We positively guarantee “ MYFA TEA ” to be the identical Tea hitherto
sold as MITCHELL’S “MY FAVORITE.” What’s in a Name ? A good
deal. Be warned! In future, when you wish to purchase MITCHELL’S
“MY FAVORITE” Tea, ask for
MYFA

Ed. Bulletin, —The New Woman’s policy
is essentially destructive. She is an abolitionist
pure and simple. She wishes to abolish clubs and
pubs. ; Sunday trams, trains, and steamers ; the
drink curse, the social evil, and every other evil.
Her little spoke is to go into the wheel of every-
thing the natural man delights in, everything
joyous and free, everything large and airy, every-
thing that this poor, weary, old world has ever
got any pleasure out of, or is likely to get any
pleasure out of. It is not a vote she wants :it is
a veto. — Bolardo.
-Re bull savagery. Combined with the
cold spoken of by “Toro,” confined life and high
feeding give English beasts bad livers, and a
bad liver means a bad temper. I have slaughtered
!0 or 15 bulls per week in England, and very
seldom found a sound liver in the lot. Hereford
bulls were the worst-tempered in my experience,
and the same breed, of bullocks out here is very
hot-tempered. But there! everything male in
Britain, from a man to a gander, is worse-tempered
than in any other part of the world that I have
been in. Perhaps it is fog-influence.— Knife and
Steel.
It is everybody’s turn sometimes to be taken
down a peg or two. Melb. musical circles have
lately been smiling over what happened to a very
perky and distinctly gifted young artist, who
clings to one instrument and has a very good
idea of his own talents. After he had play, and
his best at a recent concert where his deadly riv; 1
also appeared, a stranger strolled up to the rival
m the artists’ room and congratulated him (the
rival) on the perky one’s performance, concluding
with the remark, “Your cleverest pupil, lam
shuah ?” The feelings of the perky one are
beyond the reach of printable language. But un-
pleasant as such contretemps may be, they are the
sort of thing which lead a man far higher up the
ladder of fame than any amount of greasy adula-
tion.
A startling assertion about meteorites has
been made by Mr. Fletcher, of the British Museum.
1 rom the state of the native iron of which they
are largely composed, he infers that they are not
fragments of a smashed planet, but that they have
been formed in space, where there was neither
oxygen nor water.

Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir _l hereby beg to certify that having been a sufferer from
General Debility of the Nervous System for over seven years, and
having tried without success several of the leading doctors both in
Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to try your Alfahne Remedies.
I am thankful I did so, for after a few courses of the Alfahne Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most happy to recommen*
your remedies to anyone suffering as I was. Thanking you for yom
courtesy and the uniform patience with which you have treated me,

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. . August, 1894.
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 18711 was eight days in the water sheep-
washing, and contracted rheumatism and stiffness in the joints, and
have tried all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney I had a
great difficulty in walking, and went to the Turkish baths, which did
no good. Passing your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. li. W.
O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as I had, which led me to
try vour Remedies. On Thursday before Good -Friday I took the first
of your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special Powerful Alfahne
Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with
Diver and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfahne Eucalyptus Oil,
and lam now, with the blessing of God, as well in health as I was 23
years ago. I can with great confidence recommend your Remedies to
anyone suffering from the same complaint. May you long be spared
under God to be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully, JOHJN JAJIiAy.

Great Debility and Weakness Cured.
51 Barkly-street, Ballarat, Victoria, Aug. 29, 1892.
To Herr Rassmussen. . it - ... ..
Dear Sir,—l have much pleasure to inform you that your Alfaline
Remedies have acted most wonderful in my case, and I consider that
the great virtues you claim for them have been entirely substantiated
not only in my case, but in several of my family and acquaintances to
whom I have recommended their use. I consider they are far more
efficacious than any remedy yet brought before the public. I consider
you are second to none as a human benefactor.
I am, yours truly, EDWARD DREW.
A Lady’s Wish, Fulfilled.

Dear Sir, I shall recommend your Alfaline Remedies to all sufferers I
come across. You are quite at liberty to publish or make what use you
like of this testimonial, and anyone writing to me will have full

DR. SPEER
Mr. Pateson, the manager of the N.S.W.
Fresh Food and 100 Cos., seems to have taken the
province’s butter-industry under his hat. He has
lately received from London a cablegram for more
shipments of butter.
The Austral Cycle Agency has a business
centre in every Australasian province, an agent in
every important township, and the lost explorer
who turns into a cave to die finds the firm’s can-
vasser there, using his wheel as a grid-iron
and reading Thr Bulletin while cooking his
’possum and nardoo. The firm states that its
output is fifty times that of any similar concern in
Australasia, and if these figures lie it is because
they are under the estimate. It is the sole Aus-
tralasian agency for the renowned Beeston-Hum-
ber, a mi chine which holds the record for J-mile
to 4000 miles, and is capable of putting the record
up from here to the sun. Elliot, the Sydney
manager, wears stockings, has won scares of
bicycle races, has several champions as assistants,
reeiives the latest novelty by next mail from
London and elsewhere, and has a big say in the
Australian Fioycling News. He is, therefore,
pretty busy, and on rare moments, when not busy,
he leans back in his office chair and contemplates
a coffin-lid.

Dear Bulletin, —That illustrious phrase-
monger, Oscar Wilde, has been condemned
by a jury —he was convicted by public
opinion long ago. Yet this is just one
of those cases in which both public opinion
and juries are liable to go astray. The Greek
artistic spirit aroused in all cultured Greeks an en-
thusiasm for physical beauty which nowadays
would be more than dangerous ; nevertheless, it is
only the dustiest pedant who dares impute as
habitual to the Greeks anything of that which our
Law “refuses to mention.” All the same, if
Plato, for instance, lived in Loudon now, and sur-
rounded himself with well-built youths, and spoke
and wrote as he did in Athens long ago, he would
soon be doing “two years hard.” Wilde is—by
fad —a Hellenist. May it not well be that his
known exaggeration of all things has caused his
hyper-Hellenism to place him in a position which
an Athenian would have understood perfectly, but
which is absolutely unintelligible to a British
jury? So far as can be judged, he has had as fair
a trial as the Law could give him, and, in the in-
terests of Art, it is to be deplored that the most
brilliant phrasemonger of our day should have
forced upon society the necessity of shutting him
up.—Yours, X. [According to evidence given as
to certain alleged specific acts of Wilde’s, Plato,
under similar conditions, would well deserve his
“ two years’ hard.”]

Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
did for the Invalid Daughter of a Prom-

“My daughter had for a long time been
troubled with violent headaches and sleep-
lessness. She was pale, had no appetite,
and was losing flesh rapidly. She took
various remedies for her trouble, but re-
ceived no benefit until she commenced using
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. After taking half a
bottle, she began to feel better. By a con-
tinued use of this medicine, her appetite re-
turned, her cheeks began to fill out and show
color, she gained in strength, her headaches
disappeared, she slept better, and now says
she feels like a new person.”—F. P. Cogges-

EXTRACTS
FROM
PRIVATE LETTERS.
“It is with heartfelt grati-
tude I write to tell you of the
great benefit my little daugh-
ter Gladys has derived from
‘llenger's Food.' The doctor
and all who saw her thought
we should never he able to
rear her. Wo took her to the
hospital, and the authori-
ties recommended ‘ Ilenger’s
Food.' From that time she
began to pick up flesh and
strength.”
"If every mother knew of
Its value no other would be
used.”
' The Bulletin’s ’ Scrap-Book
COOKING AND COURTING.
Dear Ned, no doubt you’ll be surprised
When you receive and read this letter \
I’ve railed against the married state.
But then, you see, I knew no better.
I met a lovely girl down here ;
Her manner is-well, very winning,
We’re soon to be—well, Ned, my boy,
I’ll tell you all from the beginning.
I went to ask her out to drive
Last Wednesday—it was perfect weather—
She said she couldn’t possibly,
The servants had gone off together.
(Our servants often go away
At cousins’ funerals to be looking).
Pies must be made, and she must stay,
She said, to do that branch of cooking.
“ Oh ! let me help you, then,” cried I ;
“ I’ll be a cooker, too ; how jolly.”
“ All right,” she answered with a smile,
“ But you will soon repent your folly,
For I shall be a tyrant, sir,
And good hard work you’ll have, or something.
So sit down there, and don’t you stir,
But take this knife and pare that pumpkin.”
She rolled her sleeve about her arm —
That lovely arm so plump and rounded.
Outside the morning sun shone bright;
Inside the dough she deftly pounded.
Her little fingers sprinkled flour
And rolled the pie-crust up in masses,
I passed a most delightful hour
’Midst love and sugar and molasses.
And when her sleeve came down, and I
Fastened it up—her hands were doughy—
Oh ! it did take the longest time,
Her arm, Ned, was so fair and snowy.
She blushed and trembled, and looked shy,
Somehow, that made me all the bolder;
Her arched lips looked so red that I
Soon found her head upon my shoulder.
We’re to be married, Ned, next month ;
Come and attend the wedding revels,
I really think that bachelors
Are most forlorn, unhappy devils.
You’d better go for some girl’s hand,
And if you are uncertain whether
You dare to make a straight demand —
Why, just try cooking pies together.
“ Know him ? ” “ Fluently.” —In Town.
It costs from £3 to £4 weekly to keep a

Smoke Eagle Cigarettes.
A child one year and 11 months old was
lost in the bush near Louth, N.S.W., the other
day. When found, five days afterwards, he had
walked thirty miles, and was still walking, though
very much exhausted.
Smoke Eagle Cigarettes.
Melbourne Hospital is some £15,000 in
debt. The sharebrokers, headed by Willder and
Butters, were nobly in the van when last the in-
stitution was in trouble, but this time the lead
must be taken bv others. The hospital was
founded 20th May, 1840 (55 years ago), so has
done much for suffering humanity. If boom
donations are impossible, let multitudes of minor
offerings wipe off the debt.

figurements. Sulpholine developes a lovely skin.

PREMIER OINTMENT in the SOUTHERN

have lately made New South;Wales their home, it
may be as well to let them know that there is such,
an turtle le as JOBEPHSGN’S OIN'I'MENT purely

Row’s Assorted Bitters
CONTAIN
Row’s Dandelion Bitters.
We recommend these BITTERS to be taken
two or three times a day ; a wineglassful for an
adult, smaller quantity for children.
For General Debility, Dyspepsia, Rheumatism,
and Cutaneous Affections.
The action of dandelion, more especially upon
the liver and kidneys, is more reliable for remov-
ing all impure secretions than any ottier medicinal
plant known.
Persons suffering from Skin diseases will find
these Bitters invaluable.
DIRECTIONS FOR USE.
One wineglass two or three times a day after
meals diluted with same quantity of water. For
young people about half the quantity twice a day.
They Purify the Blood and Liver.
See what a Medical Gentleman saya
about them.
Messrs. E. Row and Co.
With thanks for forwarding me a bottle of your
Row’s Dandelion Bitters, and consider them most
excellent, and superior to many others that I have
previously tried.. Yours faithfully, HENRY
CHARLES CURTIS, M.R.C.S., England,
Port Adelaide, October 30, 1886.
Baron Berzilius’
Buchu Bitters.
BARON BF.R7.ILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly, given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Untie, from
the loss of tone in the parts concerned in its eracuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in D\ spepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affection?. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it alscK assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. : —The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in ovei doses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions cf Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in cases
of habitual costivenefs.
D. ECKSTROM. iI.D.- 8888-I find thrse Bitters a
most valuable and, wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
Q. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exeits a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
“ That I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that 1 have, been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs,
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU’LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
a 6 ROW’S STEANE’S WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when sutlering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
Teetotallers will find this newly-invented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION. —When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.

“ A Golden Shanty."
A Remembrance.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Just as the day was drawing near
To that brief blessed hour when light.
Faded, but in a measure clear,
Suggests the coming of the night,
You spoke to me. You told me there,
In that dim room, what life nor death
Can ever dull to me. I hear
Across long years your broken breath.
Dim and romantic was the room—
The dull room, worn to shabby grey.
The light was tender, and the gloom
Lay where the dimmest patches lay ;
And somewhere there were daffodils ;
And through the window-panes, the street,
So crude and sombre in the day,
Put on a garb for evening meet.
The rain, the fitful twilight shower,
Lay wet upon the pavement’s face,
And, where the lamplights marked the hour,
Red gleams grew in the shining space
Of path and roadway. And above,
High up where that long terrace turned
Its face to west, one dying flame
Of sunset i-n a window burned.
A silence was upon the house,
So still we were that, in a dream,
I heard a stealthy little mouse
Nibbling a crust behind the screen.
And, in a dream, I seemed to count
The lazv flapping of the blind
Against the window, as the wind
Went wandering roguishly behind.
And, in a dream, a voice began
At last to speak. I hear it still
Across the years. A tremor ran
Along its tones at first; a thrill
Of subtle sadness, softly sweet.
And dear as that clear joyful note,
That deepened afterwards when we
Had sailed dur love bark far afloat.
And in the same strange, silent dream—
The rainy pavement shining still,
The western window still agleam,
And still the haunting daffodil,
My mind, awander, in a waste
Where unknown winds and flowers blew —
The gates that held a world unclosed,
And I, still dreaming, wandered through.
How long ago ! Three score of years.
.My hair long grey, and you asleep
For many a year, and all our fears,
Laid where cur hopes lie, still and deep.
Who would believe that I still see,
Across three score of years, the spray
Of unblown roses on your gown,
Inwoven with its shimmering grey.
Sydney.

which wants him to have a big shortage at the
end of the year, so that it may wail over the
incapacity of the land-tax Government —calls on
the Assembly to cast out the bill and pay up the
additional pensions like a man and a brother.
A recent traveller gives a description of
Jerusalem which is strangely suggestive of what
Australian cities will be, when the teetotal and
Sabbatarian crowd, and the Social Gimlet Society,
and the pious, blue-spectacled variety of New
Woman, get on top :
Jerusalem has no clubs, no bar-rooms, no beer-gardens,
no concert-halls, no theatres, no lecture-rooms, no places
of amusement of any kind, no street bands, no wandering
minstrels, no wealthy or upper classes, no mayor, no
aldermen, no newspapers, no printing-presses, no book-
stores---except one outside the walls for the sale of Bibles
—no cheerfulness, no life. No one sings, no one dances,
no one laughs in Jerusalem ; even the children do not
play.
The Desolation which is to come !
The Bulletin clips from N.Q. Figaro
this extract from poet Cowper, and respectfully
offers it for consideration by St. Stead, whose
Refuse of Refuse, with all the plums picked out
of Grant Allen’s naughty “Woman Who Did,”
has, it is alleged, been refused circulation by the
leading firm of Irish news-agents :
Ye pimps who under virtue’s fair pretence
Steal to the closet of young innocence,
And teach her, inexperienced yet and green,
To scribble as you scribbled at fifteen ;
Who, kindling a combustion of desire,
With some cold moral think to quench the fire ;
Though all your engineering proves in vain,
The dribbling stream ne’er puts it out again ;
Oh, that a verse had power and could command
Far, far away these flesh-flies of the land.
Who fasten without mercy on the fair,
’ And suck, and leave a craving maggot there.
Howev’r disguised the inflammatory tale
\ And covered with a fine-spun specious veil,
Such writers and such readers owe the gust
And relish of their pleasure all to lust.
During ’94, Sydney Meat Preserving Oo.
killed 1,050,383 sheep and 8475 head of cattle, all
purchased at Homebush saleyards.
In the columns of the Quonq Yiok Wah
Bo (Sydney Cidnese newspaper) appears an ac-
count of a fracas at Raratonga between the
Japanese and Chinese residents. Three Japs
were shot dead and one Chinkie mortally
wounded. No reference to this has appeared in
the M.L. or Australian papers, and the naval
authorities say they know nothing about it.
One satisfactory feature about the new
N.S.W. Land Act is, that it defines the basis on
which the squatters’ improvements are to be valued
when the selector comes along. Hitherto the law
was very vague. If a fence ran through a selection,
the squatter demanded (and generally got) pay-
ment to the extent of its full value as a serviceable
fence, though to the selector it was valuable only
as material. Now the Act (section 51) says that
the value “ shall be calculated on the basis of the
value of such improvements to the land
purchased or leased ” —not on the basis of their
value to the squatter.
Between December, 1890, and December,
1894, the public debt of New South Wales
increased by over £4 per head, that of Queensland
by £3 7s. per head; and that of Victoria by
£3 15s. per head. Westralia enlarged her liabili-
ties by £17 per head, and Tasmania by over .£5.
In the same period S.A. reduced her debt by
£1 5<., and Maoriland by £3 per head. This is
the period covered by the reign of the democratic
Ministry in Maoriland, and the result is the best
ever shown by any Australasian Ministry since
the first beginning of the great borrowing mania.
Private wealth in the same province has increased,
under the same devastating regime, from £228 per
head to £232, and the total wealth of the country
has grown by £14,000,000. The Maorilanders
have now a larger proportion of savings - bank
deposits per head than the people of any
other province,. South Australia alone ex-
cepted. Also, the total deposits in Maori-
land banks increased materially between 1890
and 1893 (the last year for which figures are
available), while those of N.S. Wales, Victoria,
S.A. and Tasmania diminished considerably, and
those of Westralia and Queensland increased on a
comparatively small scale. The monotonous wail
about the capital which is being “driven out ” of
Maoriland by democratic legislation looks remark-
ably foolish in the light of these figures.
THE HANDFUL OF THINGS WE KNOW
Several years ago an American humorist and poet
published some verses called “Little Breeches.”
This was an odd name given to a very small boy
who was caught out in a tremendous snowstorm,
and finally found in some hay quite a distance from
the house. However the boy got there bothered
everybody to explain. It was certain he never
could have walked. So his father said the angels
must have done it; “they just stooped down and
toted him to where it was safe and warm,” he said.
The poetry about it (supposed to have been written
by the youngster’s father) starts off in this way : —
I don’t go much on religion,
I never ain’t had no show ;
But I’ve a middling tight grip, sir,
On the handful of things I know.
That’s it; the handful of things we know. There
aren’t many of ’em, but there are a few. And one
of them is this : That for a hundred results there
is only one cause. Nature developes and makes
differences ; never a new force.
Here, for example, is an incident which shows
our meaning. About Christmas, 1889, Mr. E. B.
Wright had an attack of influenza. Previous to
this he had always been strong and hearty. Well
he.got over the influenza; still, it had given him
(as he says) “a shake.’-’ After this he got along
fairly well, until February of this year (1892) when
the influenza attacked him again. This time the
malady “ meant business.” Nearly every bone
and muscle in his body ached like sore teeth. His
fekin was hot and dry, and to bed he was obliged
to go. For sixteen days he was under a doctor.
At the end of that time he found himself alive
and that was about all you could say for him.
In his letter he goes on to tell what happened
next. “ I had a foul taste in the mouth,” he says,
“ and my teeth and tongue were covered with a
thick slimy phlegm. My wife says my tongue
was like an oyster-shell, and I’m sure it was rough
as a nutmeg grater. What I ate, which wasn’t
much, gave me pain in the chest and sides. After
a mouthful or two I felt full and blown out, and
I used to swell to a great size. By-and-by a
hacking cough set in and my breathing got short
and quick. At night I lay for hours gasping for
breath, and often coughed so I was afraid I should
burst a blood vessel. I got weaker and weaker and
was like a hroken-winded horse. The doctor said
it was asthma, but he wasn’t able to relieve it.
Although I live only two minutes’ walk from the
factory where I work, 1 had to stop and rest on
my way many a time.
“Thus matters went with me until June, 1892;
Then one day I took up the Essex Newsman, and
read of a man living at Earsham, near Bungay,
having been cured by Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup. I got some of this medicine from the
International Tea Company, Braintree. After a
few doses my breathing grew easier, and by
keeping on with the Syrup my food soon digested,
the cough left me, and I gained strength. I am
now as strong as ever, can eat anything, and walk
for miles. I am a bruslunaker, and work at the
factory of Messrs. John West and Sons, High
Street, Braintree, and have lived in this town over
forty years. (Signed) E. B. Weight, Sandpit
Road, Braintree, Essex, August 23rd, 1892.”
Now let us see how this illustrates the proposi-
tion wo started out with. For almost three years
Mr. Wright was ill with what seemed like a series
of different diseases. He had the influenza twice,
the asthma once, and another disease which he
gives no name to—even if he recognised it. Look
for a moment at the variety and incongruity of the
pains and troubles he mentions, and he doesn’t
describe them all, either. You would fancy he
had half a dozen ailments at least. Yet he had
hut one —indigestion and dyspepsia—of which all
his bodily disturbances (influenza included—a
blood disease) were symptoms. All came out of
the stomach, and when Seigel’s Syrup set that
right the others quietly departed.
What, then, is one thing of “ the handful of
things we know ?” Answer: That nearly all
sorts of diseases are really symptoms of indigestion
and dyspepsia, and that Mother Seigel’s Curative
Syrup cures it.
Double that fact up in your fist and hold on to-
it tight.

“Rich the treasure , sweet the pleasure■ sweetest pleasure after pain.
Dryden (Homocea Measure.)
“IT TOUCHES THE SPOT.”—Aye, that is what ‘Homocea’
does. And does it quickly too—whether it’s a toothache or
neuralgia, with all their shooting pains, or eczema, with its
painful and distressing irritation. Rheumatism in the joints or
muscles has been cured, even of years’ standing—while for
cuts, burns, and bruises it is far ahead of any ointment that has ever been
before the public.
LORD GARRICK
says ‘ Homocea’
cured him of He-
morrhoids, when
d
all else failed ; that he gave some to a labourer who was rendered quite lame
fd
by a stone falling upon him, and it cured him in tour
days. A woman had a pain in the elbow and could
not bend it for a year, and it cured her, and another
used it for a bad leg, and it was doing her good.
One letter closes from him with the words, “It is the
most wonderful stuff I ever came across.”
LORD COMBERMERE says that he
found “ Homocea did him more good
than any other embrocation he had ever
used for rheumatism.
f
Remember that “ Homocea” subdues inflammation and allays irritation almost as soon as applied.
All Storekeepers and Chemists stock “Homocea.”

My Message.
( FOR THE BULLETIN.)
[Dedicated most disrespectfully to the shoal of Labor
bards who are always telling us to “ Arise! for the Dawn
of Freedom is breaking and to “ Hark 1 for I hear them
coming et cetera. 1
I have waited, I have waited for the Message 1 in-
to sing ;
I have waited for the Goal of Fire from Seraph
visiting ;
I have gazed upon the Morning Star and turned
towards the East,
With an ever-waiting welcome for the long-
expected Priest.
I have sorrowed with my kindred, I have wept
upon their woes,
I have watched my people falling prone and wor-
shipping their foes ;
With an anguished ear have listened for theruitle
of a wing,
But the mists have swallowed up the Sun there
is no song to sing !
On the Promontory by the Sea, where hopeless
ones are drawn,
I have stood towards the East to catch the Mes-
senger of Dawn;
But the madness of the hell-surge of the fools who
call me kin,
And the seething sprays that geyser from the
cauldron of their sin,
Fume a fogginess of vapours, blow a drift of
cloudy spawn
That depregnates all the brightness— in its cradle
chokes the Dawn !
Till my heart is filled with patencies that murder
as they cling—
I embrace the deadly present, and—l have no
song to sing.
In the gloomy Hell of Midnight, in the Jack-o’-
Lantern fen,
When I least expected Messenger, I got my
Message then. ... .
And a Grinning Devil hissed it, and I felt that it
was true,
For a hundred times I’ve thought it, as the
Grinning Devil knew.
When I’ve watched the so-called Saviours of their
persecuted mates
Reaching for the loaves and fishes’ and the
sceptres of the fates,
Pooling pasture for themselves and leaving mates
to “ do the hard,”
Like a mob of thirst-mad cattle, crushed and
goring, in a yard.
Yes ! the message comes —with sibilance, with
scorn I never dreamt.
With expectorated hatred, with unutterable con-
tempt
For the herd of you, the whole of you, the cobbler
and the king ! .
And the swineherd and the poet is this Message
that I bring :
“Bobtailed Wolves of Revolution ! never shams
like you were free, )
For the compensating reason that you don t
deserve to be. .
Born engrained with every instinct that the
meanest grovel craves,
You are only fit for scourging, you are only sweet
as slaves 1
“Though you’ve slipped the bonds of countries
where you lifted varlet hands
To the Masters of the Maner as the Lords Divine
of lands;
Though you’re cursing lands where Freedom at its
fountains might be drunk,
If your hearts were only free—of your choice,
you’re just as sunk !
You were built for masters’ handling, and you
dare not change your kinds,
You were made for whips and lashes, and you’ll
live, and die—just hinds !
You insult the God who made Man free, by being
—just a “ thing 1”
Husks are far too good for you, and that’s the
song I have to sing.”

Dear Bulletin,—4 saw blatm Bey in Cairo
a f ew days ago. He looks none the worse for
doing his 12 years’ “stretch” under the Mahdi.
While a captive in Orndurman he had eight wives
served out to him. This is the kind of “ stretch ”
that many of the Darlinghurst birds would not
object to ; in fact, could do it on their blooming
’ead. The Mahdi is not as black as he is painted.

Smoke Eagle Cigarettes,
A big tailoring-firm played a pretty smart
j as( . ]jj as t er . Just before Easter they were
rushed with orders from customers who wanted
t b e [ r clothes in time for the holidays, and would
only order on that condition. The firm promised
f a j dl f u [[y t 0 have the suits ready by Thursday
night, and so took scores of orders without the
| eagfc cb ance of executing them, receiving a deposit
in each case. On the Thursday they got together
a n tVi 6 misfits and slops in the place, made them up
- nto p arce [ s an d sent them round in the afternoon.
Consequently each customer received during the
evening a mysterious parcel of clothes several
sizes too large or too small, and of totally different
material from his order. He cursed and swore
and then remembered that he wouldn’t be able to
set things right till the holidays were over. On the
day after the holidays the shop was rushed by irate
holiday-makers who wanted to know what it all
meant. Then two of the most suave and soapy
ta,lorB imaginable led each client aside and care-
fully explained that it was a great mistake on the
the third deputy-assistant cutter, who would
be dismissed at once This pacified all who called,
and as a few accepted without murmur the slops
sent them those tailors made a good thing out of
it, executing the orders at their leisure,

Deceivers Ever.
( FOR THE BULLETIN.)
A musical evening in Adelaide. Two girls have
just been introduced to each other.
Ist Girl: “ Oh, lam so glad to meet you ; you
have been to the South Seas, have you not ?
2nd Girl : “ Yes, I returned from Samoa six
months ago.”
Ist Girl: “ Samoa? Did you meet a Mr. Brull,
there?” _ ~
2nd Girl: “Eugene Brull? Tall man, wore
pinc-enez, rather handsome.”
Ist Girl: “ Very handsome.” .
2nd Girl: “ Oh, yes, I knew him well, both him
and his wife.”
Ist Girl : “ His what?” .
2nd Girl: “ His wife. A pretty half-caste girl,
quite light-colored, passionately fond of Brull.
She had the loveliest hair, she could sit on it, you
never saw ”
Ist Girl (excitedly): “Do you know what you
are saying ?”
2nd Girl: “ Perfectly well. Lolo, that was her
name, was a great friend of mine. I used to go to
her house every day for afternoon tea. She had
the dearest little son, a baby, quite white, with
blue eyes.” .
(Someone at the piano begins to sing, and there
are murmurs of “ Sh-h, Sh-h.” During the song
Ist Girl twists her hands together and bites her
underlip in an agitated way.)
Ist Girl (at conclusion of song): ‘ Was he
really married to this Lolo ? ”
2nd Girl: “Married? She would have been
very much insulted if I had asked her such a
question. Married? Of course she was. I don’t
know whether it was before the Consul, but it was
before a missionary—a native one, perhaps,
gave me this pretty shell-bangle. Look at it.”
Ist Girl (with horror): “I wouldn’t touch it for
the world.”
2nd Girl (mystified): “ Why, on earth—did you
—did you know Mr. Brull?”
Ist Girl (wildly): “ I know him ? You—you—
beast to tell me these things a,bout him. lam to
be married to him in a fortnight. My wedding-
dress came home to-day.” (She bursts into tears
and hurries out of the room.)

Rev. Stewart Headlam, one of Oscar
Wilde’s bailsman, is the Anglican parson who
startled a fashionable congregation in West-
minster Abbey, some years ago, by asking them
whether they knew that it was a Socialistic car-
penter they were worshipping. In a sermon, a
little while ago, he thus delivered himself on
“ Dancing as a Sacrament”: “Your Maniohean
Protestant, and your superfine Rationalist, reject
the dance as worldly, frivolous, sensual, and so
forth ; and your dull, stupid sensualist sees legs
and grunts with some satisfaction: but your
Saoramentalist knows something worth more than
both of these. He knows, what perhaps even the
dancer herself may be partially unconscious of,
that we live now by faith and not by sight, and
that the poetry of motion is the expression of
unseen spiritual grace.”
A Mood .
( FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It was all arranged. She had agreed uncondi-
tionally, without any undue show of reluctance.
A handsome girl, tall and slender.
He was the manager of the hotel. She was on<=
of the servants. A housemaid by calling ; a lady
by education. Twelve months of Melbourne lilt
had modified the stock of ideas which she hail
brought from her country home.
She had lots of admirers, but none she en-
couraged save the manager, and with him she felt
what no other being had the power to suggest to
her. She loved him. Unconsciously at first: his
attentions were strictly sub rosa —even the other
maids had no suspicion of them.
He was an Englishman, a college graduate.
“ A colonial failure,” so his London friends
thought. She was a bush-girl, and her friends
had faith in her, but they did not trouble much
about writing letters to her. The mails went so
seldom, and the “kids” were always losing the
ink.
They had been very busy lately—holiday-time
and crowds of visitors. She went to sleep at night
aching in every limb, and woke tired still. She
went through the day’s routine mechanically.
The manager was waiting for her in his office ;
she was to see him “on business." It was her
evening off, and she was dressed in her stylish
out-door apparel.
“ It will do all right,” he said, after kissing
her ; “ but that veil is a bit thin. Go and get a
gossamer.”
She did not seek to resist his influence, and the
wine he gave her was nice to drink. So she
listened attentively as he explained once more
where the hansom would be waiting, and where
he would join her. Then she kissed him and
went to her room for the other veil.
It was not in the drawer, and she i-emembered
she had wrapped her last year’s Christmas cards
in it. She found her keys and tossed the cards
on to the table. A photo, amongst them caught
her eye.
It was a miserable amateur’s proof—a group of
country children. She saw herself as a shapeless
girl of 14, with a chubby-faced younger brother
awkwardly gripping each hand. She seemed to
feel again the trusting touch of their horny palms.
Suddenly the past came back to her, and she
heard the old coach-driver’s parting words :
“ Good-bye, my gel, take care of yerself, take care
of yerself !”
She quietly placed her hat and jacket on the
bed and put on her cap and apron. Then she
slipped the picture into her pocket and went down
to her tempter.
“ What the blazes did it?” he asked, after hear-
ing her out.
“This,” she said —and gave him the photo.
“ Damn photography !” said the manager.
