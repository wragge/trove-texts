SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 11, 1882.
Dead Men tell no Tales.
She has two epitaphs. The public epitaph is —
“ Went down like a stone!” The Marine Board
epitaph, which is supposed to sink deeper, and to
embody a certificate of the cause of death, reads
like a conundrum :—
•• That the Woniora was lost in consequence of hay-
ing been too deeply laden, and from having probably
been driven too fast to contend with the exceptionally
heavy weather she encountered ; and as her master had
discretionary power in loading her, the Board can only
attribute the fatal accident to the weather and other
perils of the sea Under these cirounutam es, they
have no evidence on which to found a charge against
the owners of the vessel."
• • •
This is con soling —to the owners, and to the S.M.
Herald, which indecently prophesied before the
investigation that no blame was attachable to the
owners. Qui s'excuse s’accuse. We wonder
whether anybody connected with this exculpating
paper is as heavily interested in the Company
which owned the Woniora, as is Mr._ Watson, the
Colonial Treasurer, in certain private wharves
brought into political prominence by Mr. Gabvan?
The S.M. Herald apologised in advance for the
disaster, and before any inquiry could be held
assured the world that no blame could be imputed
to the directors! This is what journalism has
come to in Sydney. The Marine Board also lift
the burden off the owners, <l as the master had
discretionary powers in loading her.” Had
not the master a billet to keep ? Had he
not to study the fat dividends of his employers ?
Supposing he had not carried enough coal, and
had been extra careful of the lives of his crew;
might he not possibly—wa say possibly—in the
long run have had to give place to a more ' en-
terprising ” man? Had he no negative induce-
ments, therefore, to load his boat so heavily that
with the first wash of a sudden sea it might
“ sink into the depths with bubbling groan? ”
# # •
Mr. Lee, the Inspector for the Marine Board,
stated in his evidence, that he told the master of
the Woniora that the responsibility of putting on
a load-line rested with the owners. The master
wanted to put it at ten inches, but after Mr. Lee’s
objection set it at thirteen inches. Mr. Lee
didn’t think even that sufficient. The master,
Soor fellow, knows now it was no 1 -, sufficient. Mr.
OHNSTON, the Marine Board Surveyor, “didn’t
notice her load line particularly! ” It is lucky
for somebody that Mrs. Plimsoll died in
Brisbane, and that Mr. Samuel Plimsoll did
not come out to Australia. Had he been here, he
would have made his voice heard, and there would
have been a howl all through the colonies for the
punishment of the responsible person or persons.
Sixteen sailors food for fishes through criminal
negligence ! And only *' the weather and other
perils of the sea ” to blame ! It is the duty
of the Attorney-General to overlook altogether
the finding of the Marine Board, and to
act as common justice demands that ho should
act, if enly for the purpose of preventing in future
any such throwing away of the lives of our hardi-
est and best men ? Is “ poor Jack ” to be at the
mercy of any and every money-bagging corpora-
tion that owns coffin-ships, or by its default allows
good ships to be made into sub-marine charnet-
houses ? Note the peculiar phraseology of
the latter part of the Marine Board s decision :
‘ ’ Under these circumstances, they have no evidence
on which to found a charge.” Does this mean
that there is such evidence in existence ? Let us
wind up with a dirge clipped out of the Herald s
advertising columns —(wonder whether it was
charged for ?): —

The “Amending” Land Bill.
We trust that our legislators are fully awake to
the heavy responsibility that rests on them at this
moment. It has fallen to them to deal with the
moat infamous land-system that, at this age of the
world, disgraces any people pretending to be
civilized. The so-called Amending Bill differs in
no essential from the original law which it is
proposed to displace. Every evil principle em-
bodied in the measure of 1861 is embodied and
retained in that of 1883,
If passed, the new Act will, as the old has done,
keep our rural population in discord, injuring
equally rich and poor, and benefiting only Par-
liamentary land-agents, lawyers, and land-sharks.
By [the insecurity, intrigue, and fraud which it
will engender as putrid meat breeds maggots, the
thorough use and improvement of the country
will be, as it has been for long, effectually ob-
structed. In like manner, there will be no chance
for either new-comers or the youth of the colony
growing up to get a share of the soil;—moreover,
if they could snatch a portion from the fire, in the
teeth of the factions that mangle and snarl over
their prey like wolves, anything they could get
would be in such a shape as could possibly do them
no good.
• * *
The crowning triumph of the law, according to
such statesmen as the Hon. Edmund Webb, is
the huge land revenue—'the surplus of two millions
in the Treasury. This has been got by the
pressure of selection on squattages. The land is
bought up by the aid of cheap English money in
defence of securities endangered. This revenue
does not represent wealth and profits, but debt
and waste. It is the price we have taken for
turning our natural pastures into stock-jobbing
chattels, and shutting them against real coloni-
sation. As to where this money goes to, members
of Assembly know best. The fact that it is spent
mainly in corrupting political life, and in destroy-
ing the instincts of self help and self-respect in the
people, is not likely to be descanted on from the
hustings; but it is the fact, nevertheless. Ours
is the true tale of the prodigal who squanders his
estates, feeding litigation and usury tor the pre-
sent pleasure of scattering money on the high-
ways.
The method of our land administration is just as
imbecile as our policy is vicious. The new Bill
will favour confusion, delay, and corrupt prac-
tices, like the old one—and it will tend even more
to raise the value of Ministerial patronage, and to
open a profitable field for Parliamentary land-
agency. The situation is critical. A resolute
stand by the Assembly may yet save us from sink-
ing deeper in the abysses of agrarian feud and
corrupt politics, and may, perchance, enable us to
escape the wonder and ridicule of civilised man-
kind.
Dr. Lang.
All honour to the memory of a single-hearted
patriot! Although four yea's have passed away
since Sydney citizens followed to the grave the
remains of this man, who, almost single-handed,
rough-hewed the foundations of the Australian
Dominion, yet the magic of his name was powerful
to draw to the Masonic Hall, the other
night, just such a crowd as would, twenty yeans
ago, have surrounded him on the hustings in
Wynyard Square. His name is still a living
impulse operating upon the course of present
events, and influencing the present generation.
• • •
Dr. Lang’s people, when he was seven years of
age, went to live at Largs, on the estuary of the
Clyde, Ayrshire, Scotland. His infant mind
developed itself amid some of the grandest of
Nature’s scenery. The peaked crags of Goatfell,
in Arran, rise to the west of Largs; Ailsa rears
its solitary pinnacle out of the sea to the south ;
the isles of Bute and the Comraes lie low on the
horizon to the north-west; while, easterly, undu-
lating woodlands incline upwards, and lose them-
selves in brown heath and cairn-topped hills. It
is the Bay of Naples and the JDgean combined,
under a Caledonian sky. Amidst such romantic
surroundings, the soul of John Dunmore Bans
gathered its first strength. His father was
a well-to-do tradesman, easy-going in tern-
perament; while his mother was endowed
with a singular intellect and superabundant
energy and force of character. John was
sent to college at Glasgow, where he took
the degree of M. A. Hb was afterwards ordained
by the Irvine Presbytery. His inclinations were
bent towards New South Wales by three main
circumstances. , A lady friend had an intimate
acquaintance, who was the wife of the then Com-
missary-General of the colony. Mrs. Lang, too,
had also been the foster-mother of the then
Governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane. His brother,
Mr. George Lang, had paid a visit to Australia
in 1821, and had further fired his enthusiasm about
the field it offered for his labours. The young
preacher accordingly sailed from Leith, and arrived
in Sydney in May, 1823, he being then 23 years
of age. He was welcomed cordially by Sir Thomas
Brisbane, and the Commissary-General received
him as his guest. Thus, it came about that Dr.
Lang arrived in the colony in a fashion almost
without a parallel among the founders of distin-
guished colonial families. He came independent of
all Government authority—neither with the broad
arrow on his back, nor witk any badge of office on
his shoulder. A few years afterwards the remain-
der of the family came out in the same indepen-
dent manner. In 1824, the boot’s Church, Church
Hill, Sydney, was built, and he accepted the pas-
torate. Of that church ha remained minister,
sometimes having a colleague, until the time of
his death.
• • •
Full of character, perfectly independent and
regardless of social recognition, and educated as
almost none of the official and military class then
were, there is no wonder that Dr. Lang was a
thorn in the side of Sydney society. Officers and
gentlemen were not then expected to know much,
or to hold any particular opinions. Was a man a
judge of old port, and could he tell the points of a
horse ? —he would do well enough. Could he not
look on without squeamishness while a convict or
a soldier received a hundred lashes ?—he was a
milksop. Learning and piety, as conventionally
recognised, were embodied in that sect whoso
faith, Charles II. said, “was the only religion
fit for a gentleman ’’—the Church of England.
George IV. had practically endorsed the “ Merry
Monarch’s” witticism, by signing a charter con-
ferring on the English Church one seventh of the
territory of New South Wales. No small portion
of the difficulties and labours of I)r. Lang s life
was connected with his successful efforts in resist-
ing and finally annulling this act of confiscation.
The only shred remaining of what might have
established an ecclesiastical incubus consists in
the Church and School property now merged in
the general educational endowments of the colony.
In politics, he was found to be as difficult to deal
with as in ecclesiastical matters. He followed
his own course in utter disregard of the
petty intrigues of party wire-pulling. The Ped-
lingtons, honorable and otherwise, feared and
hated him : and have since abused him when dead,
as they would never have dared to do while living.
His unswerving adherence to fixed principles was
a mystery to them. Especially, could they not
fathom the motive that led him, while sitting as a
member of the South Wales legislature, to work
as hard for one colony as for another.
• • •
The amount of labour he went throught for the
advantage of the whole colony, it it were
not well authenticated, would be incredi-
ble. He was first returned to the
Legislative Council, then the only chamber,
in 1843, as one of the representatives for Port
Phillip. He was several times afterwards one of the
members for Sydney. He undoubtedly achieved,
after infinite exertion, the separation of both Vic-
toria and Queensland from New South Wales, and,
ever consistent in his attachment to the princi-
ples of decentralization and self-government, he
supported the claim of Riverina for separation
seventeen years ago. No wonder the vestry-
politicians detested him for cutting junks out of
their territory, and reducing the field for profits,
patronage, and jobbery. One other great question
he never would let rest. He denounced unspar-
ingly that abuse of the public estate, that sacrifice
of the territory for revenue and political ends,
which is now more than ever fraught with peril to
the colony. Again and again he reminded a
Legislature, unconscious as that of to-day to all
promptings but those of petty interest, that the
Imperial Government had handed over the soil to
the local Parliament, not in order that they might
sell the lands and spend the money among the
electors, but as a trust to be dealt with solely for
the purposes of colonisation. He was also un-
doubtedly the originator of free immigration.
Education in Australia owes him the very same
debt. He did the utmost throughout his life in
favour of National instruction, and he actually
initiated in his own person high-class education.
• • •
Notwithstanding the engrossing calls upon his
attention, he found time for literature. During
his many voyages to England, he composed those
books which induced so many colonists to come to
Australia. The last volume from hia pen was a
revised edition of a treatise he had published
forty years before on the “ Origin and Migrations
of_the Polynesian Nations ; ” this was issued in
1877, the year before he died. It matters not
much, except as an act of graceful and merited
recognition, whether the movement now inaugu-
rated, to erect to Dr. Lang a memorial statue,
have practical issue or not. When the distance
of a generation has clearly outlined the landmarks
of Australian history, and swallowed up petty

“Mr. Tarleton’s” Editor.
Is the debate, on Wednesday, November 1st, upon the
Press Bill, in the Legislative Council, Adelaide, Mr.
Tarleton, referring to the Melbourne Age and its
recent comments upon the alleged maladministration
of Mr. Parsons, S.A. Minister of Education, conveyed
to his hearers, and all whom it might concern, his
notion of the modern newspaper editor. This impor-
taut personage—and especially the editor of The Age—
represents himself thus to Mr. Tarleton : “ A man in
his studio, steeped, perhaps, in drink to the eyes, and
who thinks he may use his pen as a Bed Indian uses
his scalping-knife.” It is difficult to believe that a man
of position and, presumably, of ordinary inteUigence
could use words so offensive, and betray ignorance so
deep of one whose influence upon his time is great
indeed. Perhaps, for an explanation, we shall have to
remember what colonial politicians so often are. The
facts, as generally known, are that a considerable popu-
lation is now settled in the Northern Territory of S.A.,
and that, recently, a party of Ministers and others
visited the Territory. Since that visit, discontent has
grown in the Territory, and its people, despairing of
reasonably good government from Adelaide, are on the
point of asking to be separated from it. The Age, in a
trenchant article, attributed much of this discontent to
Ministerial jobbery. Mr. Parsons, the Minister speci-
ally inculpated,! “ indignantly denies," and so on
and, for the present, there the matter rests. The
second reading of the Presi Bill, which measure-
characteristic in its priggishness—the Council was wise
enough to reject, gave Mr. Tarleton an opportunity
of mud-throwing, and he has improved the occasion.
An outsider might wonder why this special effort of
the wizened-faced Tarleton should be sent hastily
over the colonies, but the peculiar 'position of
The Age explains it. That journal has grown strong,
and keeps so, while upholding a policy which is the
abhorrence of our shoddy colonial Conservatives—
Monopolists they should rather be called. Bat it is
very likely that, by this time. Mr. Tarteton, like a
certain historic personage, is ‘‘sorry he spoke.”
“How the Apple Got In”
It is recorded that the most unfortunate of the Hano-
verians, Geoegb III., in walking about Windsor, went
into the cottage of one of the park rangers, and there
beheld the man's family eating apple-dumplings. On
one of these being cut open for his examination, the
King is said to have been siezod with the liveliest
curiosity to know “ how the apples were got in.” We
may suppose some similar inquiry will suggest itself to
those who have considered Mr. James Manning s re-
I markable paper read last week before the Boyal Society,
»n the aborigines and their religious notions. The
irdinary man would suppose that, considering the low
lature of the Australian autochthon, his religious ideas
vould be, to put it mildly, rudimentary. But, accord-
.ng to Mr. Manning, this is not so. Far from it. It
tow seems that the degraded New Holland black has
got similar notions to those entertained by a consider,
able section of the Anglo-Saxon race. He believes, it
seems, in the Trinity, in eternal punishment, in Heaven,
In fact, one would think that any black in the state
of the natural man would be eligible for church mem-
bership ; that he would shave his upper lip, and “ put
up ” as a deacon. The story is too good, Mr. Manning.
Your blacks are sophisticated. To use the better
understood phrase of the streets, they have been “ got
at.” There are many difficulties in the way of getting
at the natives’ religious opinions, and the generation
who know these opinions are fast passing away; hut
we have gained sufficient knowledge of them to say
that they are very rudimentary indeed. To assert that
group-marriage and marriage by elopement Could
co-exist with a high order of religious thought, or with
a high order of social life, is a contradiction in terms.
The Devil’s Brigade Again.
At Temora, Mr. J. T. Moran called a public meeting.
Mr Bailey, of tbe local Herald, reported the proceed- I
iugs. One Orbell took a slander action against Moran I
re statements made by him at the meeting ; also a libej
action against Bailey in respect to his report, Moran
was mulct in one shilling and costs, which latter
amounted to £36. At the Judge’s suggestion, “ to save
time and expense,” the action against Bailey was settled,
without hearing witnesses, by the journalist’s undertak-
iag to pay one shilling and costs. Next, Bailey received
a little bill from Orbell's lawyer, Kearney. It only
totalled up £28115s. I Bailey published it in full for the
delectation of his readers. Kearney then tried to horse-
whip Bailey. Kearney’s small account is very funny
reading. Such documents show what the pettifogging
ingenuity of lawyerdom can achieve. “ Preparing tele-
gram to" &c.. 3s. 4d., “ attending despatching same
6s. 81."&J.,&o.” "On receipt of notice tu produce from
defendant’s counsel perusing—6s. 8d.” 8o that it’s all
the same whether a lawyer sends a paper oris presented
with one—he charges anyhow. public is
slow, but it is gradually getting the measure of the
lawyers. The other day we published a typical and
authentic bill of costs (for £38 6s. Id), concerning a
matter in which twopence was the amount invoked.
This lawyer’s bill the unfortunate suitor declined to
pay. Then he was sued for its amount, and as a mat-
ter of course, plunged deeper into the mire. A
verdict was given for the £38 odd. Then came more
costs. This is the lawyer’s second little bill

In the foregoing, it will be seen, the lawyer has
charged £3 3s. for his professional services in recover-
ing his own costs. He has also charged £1 Is. for
attending at the same time in the character of a witness.
As Society has for a long while been foolish enough to
submit to this kind of thing, we suppose this lawyer
can hardly be blamed. He acts fairly according to
the lights in which he has been accustomed to see, and
o aim we may say (as we say of the hangman), “ If he
didn’t do it, someone else would.”

colonial beer “Sam" (Kiama): As Polonins con-
sidered the first players’ speech, so do we consider your
screed. It is “ too long.” And it you mean to be sar-
castic, you should either say so at the commencement,
or else enclose a portrait of yourself tapping your nose.
You have got a neat style—especially for a ledger—and
should forward us sometimes an item that would at
least interest a kanaka. We don’t want your opinions.
We have got plenty opinions of our own. Nearly as
many opinions, we dare say, as you have freckles
“ Fred * : Thank you for writing with a pale
pencil. You have saved us a ton of trouble
« W.P.S.": We should like to give you a show, but we
can’t torture your items into shape anyhow. We have
not only failed ignominiously, but have been made very
irritable. So we have given it up. We don’t care
about shedding any more blood this week. Try again,
though “Old Hiram": You are Hi-rum old fellow.
What yon say is to the point. But you are too com-
phmentary. We’re sick of being told that we are clever.
All we wan's to be told now is that we are beautiful
“A Bachelor": The figures are wrong, evidently.
Fancy the “ widdies" should be 696 instead of 500
“Arabi": “Pasha” is an Ottoman title given to
military and naval commanders, and governors of pro- ■
vinces. There are three grades, the distinctive badge
being a horse’s tail. The highest functionaries are
“pashas of three tails," as, for instance, the Grand
Vizier; most governors of provinces are ‘‘pashas of
two tails;" the lower provincial governors, or "san-
jaks,” are “pashas of one tail.” Arabi was a pasha of
three tails; then ha “ turned tail ’’—so how many has
he got now? A “bey” or “beg” is a lower designa-
tion, equivalent to “ one tail." A “ beglerbeg" or
“ beilerbegi,” which means “ lord of lords," has “ three
tails," and is boss over a whole lot of other “ begs."
* Justice to Letter-Carriers ": Thanks for the informa-
tion. Since you are now pocketless, you will have to
emulate the example of Alfred’s brigade, and carry
yonr lunch in your hat. 2. Of course, we have seen it.
It has 32 pages, and wo have sighed 32 times i
“Andrews" : We’ve heard more sarcasm over the cost
to the Victorian Government of the Jolimont Eailway
accident, which represented a sum of £45,000 odd, thah
we have about the destruction of the Garden Palace,
which cost £ “Justice" (Grafton): Get the
local paper to publish it. That’s the proper way
“Drafts for Acceptance": Thanks; will duly appear
“ W.B.” Very good. Held over “ A Tyane Tacke ":
The cleverest thing we have seen for many a long day.
But, dear boy, it’s too lively "J sL—h.";
Capital joke, but a little too broad as you have it.
When we can alford to put mone in the plate at tho
Congregational, we will print it as it stands “ An eld
teaman": Now, we think yon are captious. Abontthin
T. and C. Picture you say—“ Norman who had been
fourteen years at sea (as Fradericksen has) wonid stand
in the after thwarts of a boat in a heavy sei and try to
scull her." Perhaps, not;—but then yon see, dear
hoy, the chances are that the man who drew it had
never been to sea at all. He most certainly wasn’t in
the boat with Fredericksen, so we don’t really see how
you can hold him responsible..." Authority ": Thanks;
may use “A.V.C. : Your verses are very remark-
able; but when the printer came to the line about
“ sunney new South whales," he said he wouldn’t set up
the rest “E.H.W.": Bather too late “J.F D.":
Thanks; glad to hear again “J.G.W.C.": Mere
words “ A J.S.”: Your poetry shows that yon know
something about flowers: but you’d better be weeding
or digging the garden than writing about them
“EAJ.": Stale: should have been sent in next morn-
ing “K.OD.": Will read next week.
Inspector A dersou.
We give in our supplement a portrait of Inspector
Anderson, of the Metropolitan police, who has
just returned to the colony. Mr. Anderson is a
native of Fy vie, Aberdeenshire, and arrived in Now
South Wales in 1853. A year later he joined the
police, and has ever since been connected with the
force. Hia services have won him official advance-
ment and a genuine feeling of respect and coafi
deuce from the community.
Francis Burns, the alleged Thug, who was ac-
quitted of murdering Forbes and awaits trial for mur-
dering Michael Qainlivan at WickliSe, has escaped a
third prosecution. The Government analyist can find
no poison in the decomposed remains of Heeuau, whom
Burns is believed to have killed three years ago.

ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREATEST
OARSMEN.
IN a recent conversation in Kingston, Canada, with
a representative of one of the foremost journals of
the United States, Mr. Edward Triokett, the celebrated
oarsman, who is at present open to row any man in the
world, grave the following as his opinion.
** I have found St. JACOB’S OIL a sure and certain
•ore, and one unequalled by any medicine. It cured
me of severe pains in hack, brought on by over-ex*
ertton In rowing. It is a pleasant, safe, and sura
remedy, penetrating at once to the seat of the disease,
and eradicating the complaint without further trouble.'*
The writer listened attentively to the above. It was
pleasant to bear such high words of praise from one
who knew what he was talking about; and now he says
that St. JACOB’S OIL and good athletic training, ar
what all our young men want.

USINESS ANNOUNCEMENTS,
The undersigned, in conjunction with Mr. JOHN
DAVIES, of Melbourne, have THIS DAT purchased
the BUSINESS of the late Mr. W. H. ARIELL, Cam-
mission and General Merchant, of 343 and 345, Kent-
street, Sydney, and will in future carry on the said
business under the name and style of W. H. ARIELL
and CO., in the same premises, and trust, by giving due
attention to business, to merit a continuance of favours
as bestowed on our predecessor.
Sydney, Nov, 1, 1882. JOHN O’SULLIVAN,
IN REFERENCE to the above, we have every con.
fldence in recommending Messrs. O’SULLIVAN
and DAVIES to the constituents of the late Mr. W.
H. Ariell. Mr. O’Sullivan having been manager of this
business for the past 14 years will be a sufficient

ACCORDING to promise, we (five our readers, in
this week’s issue, the Seventy Founds List, as
taken from that popular little book, “ The Economical
House Furnishing Guide.’* But, before we proceed any
further, let us touch upon the word ECONOMICAL ;
let us examine it, let us really find out what it does
mean. Many persons look upon the word with scorn,
they associate it with MEANNESS, with SCANTI-
NESS; but let us turn to our dictionary and see what it
says :
E-CO-NO-MI-CAL
Relating to economy, or to the management of house-
hold er pecuniary affairs, private or public; adaptation
of means to ends; saving of waste and unnecoessary
expense; guarding against loss or waste; prudent in
expenditure.
NOW PLEASE NOTE PARTICULARLY, it means
saving of WASTE. UNNECESSARY expense, and
PRUDENT in expenditure.
The Eeomioal man is therefore a wise man.
• • • • *
And now turn to the word Economist. E-CON-O-
MIST, one who spends money, time, or labour, judi-
ciously, and without waste. It is therefore no dis.
grace to be called an economist; the man who is thus
designated is highly honoured. To Economise is to
make a prudent use of money, or of the means of saving
or acquiring property.—Be careful to economize in order
to grow ricb.
With these few remarks upon the principal word in
connection with the title of our little book, we submit
the Fifth List for your consideration.

Up at Cooktown a lad named Charley Martin,
aged 17, died with.n seven minutes after a hammering
ho got from Ah Hoy, a powerful Chinaman. Ah Hoy
is a market gardener, and wanted 6d for a water-melon.
Martin stuck a knife in it to test it, and Ah Hey
struck him. Finally, the Chinaman got Martin down
on the bed, held him with his left hand, and struck
him repeatedly on the temple with his right. Ah Hoy
was only saved by the police from being lynched. At
the inquest, however. Dr. Korteum said that he found
no post-mortem bruises, nor visible cause of death.
The heart was diseased, and death had probably re-
sulted from shook to the system.

A once very distinguished individual now fills,
jn one of oar Northern towns, the office of Inspector of
Nuisances. The inhabitants say that bis first cars
should be to remove himself.
Archibald Forbes was retained by the Abgtjs
an d S.M. Herald to write a description of the Cup
meeting, but the famous war correspondent was on his
back, ill, *■ Wnen the Assyrian," etc.
J. Eden Savill, in whose name Assyrian ran the
winner of the Melbourne Cup, is a good-looking man—a
blonde —of artistic tastes and pursuits. He is not
much on portrait drawing; his forte la caricature. He
first lifted D. C. F. Hoodie's Portqnian— long since
defunct—into something like prominence.
Colonel Richardson, we are sorry to hear, has
been very ill in England, and has gone to Germany for
the benefit of his health. Colonel Roberts, we also
regret to learn, is suffering from an optical affection,
and will probably not return to N.S.W.
And pray, when was Lieutenant-General Sir
Garnet Wolseley created a Peer of the Realm that he
should be dubbed “ Baron" in this cool wav by the
Herald P That he may have been created a Baron is
possible, that he has been does net appear at present to
be the case.
An investigation lately took place in a Southern
town into the conduct of a sub-inspector of police,
who, though a married man, is alleged to have been
guilty of the most.unmanly heartlessness towards the
daughter of a respected family in the district. The
result is not yet publicly known.
So the pious, snuffie-busting Melbourne bank
clerk, Thorpe, who was sentenced to two years for
embezzling £2000, and was about to enter the Church,
has been released before his time “ at the intercession
of his friends." “ Piety " pays, even with criminals.
He will probably now join the Salvation Army, or
“ Hallelujah Billy.”
Mr. W. M. Lewis, assistant Crown law officer
at Wellington, whose recent “attempted suicide” on the
afternoon fixed for his marriage with Miss Dyer created
so much astonishment, has beeu committed by the
magistrates to the Ashburn Hall Private Lunatic
Asylum at Dunedin. The nature of his personal in-
juries, which are now said to have been inflicted by—
well, a woman—is only spoken of in whispers.
Mr. Richard Grioc, of the well-known Melbourne
firm of Grice, Sumner, and Co , died at Pitzroy, Vie.,
on Saturday morning, from the effects of a paralytic
seizure. Ha was 69 years of age, a colonist of 44 years
standing, and, till within the last few years, a pro-
minent member of the mercantile community of Mel-
bourne. He leaves a widow, three sons, and four
daughters, one of the latter being married. One of Mr.
Grice’s daughters, now de •• a;ed, was the wife of Mr. J.
L. Purves.the eminent Victorian barrister.
District Court Judge Josephson, with his jolly
red face, his iron-grey military whiskers, and his fun-
twinkling eves beaming behind his gold spectacles,
seems to enjoy life generally, and the power of jagging
his fellow-men especially. Perhaps it is more soothing
to a trembling wretch to be beamed and smiled upon
throughout his tri«*l by a jolly-looking old gentleman,
whom one would hardly accuse of being disposed to
hurt a fly. But what a terrific crasher it must often be
when the good-humoured lips frame words carrying a
sentence which appears to the outside world to he
frightfully over-uroportioned to the offence—as often
enough happens ? The prisoner must feel bad then.
We see by London Society that “ Mr. George
Reid" is engaged to be married. Evidently the interest
in us over there is gradually extending beyond frozen
beef. George has made his mark, in no mistake. In-
deed, we oaii’t recall to out memory—now that the old
J.P.’s are abolished —anyone who has made his mark so
often. The London paper says Mr. Reid’s bride-eleot is
•• Miss Best, of Aberdeen." We are glad to see that
George has gone in for something “ superlative.” But
Aberdeen, though 1 Surely this can’t be a but no I—
impossible! The world, as at present constituted, is
not large enough to contain two George Reids. [Yes, it
is.— Ed. B.]
When Frank Gardiner, who (it ia said) died in
a ’Frisco shanty recently, was “ out,” the police might
have stopped his career almost from the jump. Little
Jimmy M'Auley, once a stockman on the Lachlan, was
in the secret service as a scout. One midnight he
startled the police by riding in and reporting that he
had seen “the whole lot of them—Gardiner, Gilbert,
O’Meally, and Dunn—camped near a lagoon about eight
miles out on the Lambing Flat Road.’’ The rangers’
horses, too, were in a pine scrub on the other side of
the creek. “Give me some mounted men," he added,
“ and I can go straight and pot the lot. I saw ’em not
an hour ago.” Bit Jimmy was asked to report himself
next morning, when his statement could be “ taken
down in writing 1” The gang was miles away next day,
and bossed the bush for months afterwards.
It may interest the good-natured portion of our
sporting men to know that the rider of the first Vic-
torian Dturby, poor old Dick Snell, has for many years
been driving a two-horse car between the Exchange
Sydney, and Surry Hills. He was one of the straighteit
and smartest of our light-weight “ silks and satins " in
his time, but the “ light of other days has faded" now.
Dick received a fearful fall during one of his races, and
his head has never been so level since; but he is still
honest and industrious, and open to give the trams a
suurt with his old four-wheel hen-coop any day Mr.
Good chap likes to put up the stakes, A ’busman earns
about 30s. a week, and works about thirty-seven hours
a day to make that. Persons who hold the winner of
the last Derby for a pot of money might, therefore, do
worse than remember the little veteran who won the
first one.
“ Sir Arthur Gordon,” says a cable to the
Herald, “ is to be appointed Governor of the West
Indies." Well, it would be supposed that the leading
journal would correct obvious errors and make its
news intelligible; and that, if it objected to altering
cablegrams, at all events it would not make a blunder
of its own by repeating the statement in its town news
columns. The British West Indies consists of the
Bermudas, Borbadoes, Trinidad, Jamaioa, Honduras,
8t. Kitts, St. Vincent, Tobago, the Bahamas, Demer-
rara, &o., &o., each of which “West Indies” has a
governor I Clearly, then, according to the leading
journal, these gentlemen are to be “Black Wednes-
dayed,” and Sir Arthur Gordon appointed in their
pieces. And where is his seat of government to
be ? On board a ship of war moored out in that part of
the Atlantic Ocean known as the Carribbean Seas 1 Of
course, had we been informed that Sir Arthur had been
appointed Governor of “the Australias, we should
have had a Herald lecture on English ignorance.
Like that of the Policemen in the “ Pirates of
Peuzunce,” the lot of Princes after all is not a “ happy
one." After a two years’ cruise, during which they
were worked a little, and bored almost to death, the
Princes Bertie and George got safely back to the old
man ; bat they had scarcely recovered from their sea-
legs before they were marched off to Whippingham
Church, Cowes, to be confirmed, and like calves they
submitted quietly. The Archbishop of Canterbury put
them through after a long and tedious service, and then
the kettle to the trumpet spoke, and there were “ flour
doinga” on a most extensive scale. When the whole
concern was over. Prince George, being asked what ho
thought of Confirmation, replied, “Well, it’s better
than one of Bob Smith’s processions—but not much—
got a chew about you, Dawson ? " Bertie, however,
declared it was the happiest day of his life; that he
now felt strengthened in the good cause, and nearer to
Heaven than ever he was before. Of course, he meant
nearer by land; .but he’s a good, religious lad, is Bertie,
and grows more like his Pa every day.
The name of Dr. Maccatchem ia doubtless still
green in the memories of many. Ic is in ours, anyhow.
He arrived here during the small-pox scare, and used
to vaccinate with calf lymph, exhibiting the “ animilo"
°n the balcony in front of his house. The Doctor
got his name up years ago. He was residing
on the Kaiparo River, N.Z., and Governor Bowen hap-
pening to arrive in his yacht, Mac. promptly invited
His Excellency and suite to dinner. The invitation
Was accepted by Sir George, and in due course the
banquet came off. The dinner was excellent, the wines
8 nperb, and the table looked very gay with glass and
flowers. Sir George, after passing a pleasant evening,
himself highly pleased with the menu selected
“J the Doctor, and was particularly encomiastic on the
of the wines. Next day, however, he was
thoughtful. On conversing with the steward, ha dis-
covered that his host had borrowed everything from
the yacht, excepting only a sheep, which had been sup-
plied after some reflection by the local batcher. A bill
for the use of the articles was sent round in due course,
but the gifted Mao repudiated it, on the ground that
the articles were “ for the use of His Excellency the
Governor." He, however, offered free vaccination all
round j a proposal which was indignantly declined.
A certain judge, who ia not noted for his extreme
liberality, was travelling on circuit, haring for his
companion a member of the Bar whose reputation has
never suffered from a charge of reckless prodigality.
Being about to proceed from one town to another, his
Honor interviewed a groom belonging to the honse
whereat he stayed, and said to him: “ William, get up
at four in the morning, wash the buggy, and give the
horses a good rubbing down." William did so. His
Honor appeared at six o’clock, fonnd the turn-out all
ready, and, jamping in, took his seat. Then, while
waiting for the learned counsel, he handed the groom
threepence, and drew back to witness the man’s sur-
prise at this magnificent gift. The man looked at the
coppers, and then at the judge, and said, pleadingly:
“ Why, sir, I can’t get a drink with this.” “ All the
better ; yon should not touch such poison. Come on,
P , I’m ready,” and, as the barrister sprang into
the vehicle, off he drove. After a few fnrtive glances
at his friend, the judge exclaimed suddenly: “ Here, I
say. F , you owe me three ha'pence.” “ What
for ?” wonderingly asked the eminent pleader. “ Why,
I gave the man threepence for cleaning the trap and
horses," replied his Honor. “ Well, 1 like that I" re-
torted F , “if you like to make a d d I good
fellow of yourself, you’re not going to do it at my ex-
pense.” At the next town they parted, and they are
now deadly enemies.
Ebenezer Cooke is the Gladstone in finance of
South Australia. At least, he thinks so; and even
tneers sometimes at Lavvy Glyde, the present Treasurer,
who also deems finance his strongest point. At any rate,
Cooke ia a first-class book-keeper, and, as chairman of
the last Finance Commission, pat hon. members up to
a ]few useful wrinkles in regard to keeping the public
accounts. As an orator, Cooke is dogmatic and irritable.
No subject is too stnpendons for him, and he resents
contradiction. The lease interjection throws him “off
his onion.” Ha doesn’t take main issues much, but
sneeringly elaborates every petty detail, until the House
thinks him a bore. He labours under several oratorical
disadvantages, not the least being the unpleasant habit
ef “ er"-ing his sentences. He is a corpulent, ungrace-
ful man, with a beard red enough and long enough for a
Methody, preacher and his “hardshell" style of delivery
• helps out the illusion. He has a habit, when savage—and
that’s often—of stuffing half the left side of his ample
beard in his month and grinding his teeth ferociously.
He possesses, too, a siblilant defect in elocution. He
was one of the members for Flinders, but has retired ta
take the position of one of the two commissioners of
audit under the new Audit Act. He wiU be more useful
there than in the House.
Ebenezer Ward, M.P., of Adelaide, has got a
paper again. We have just received it. The name of
the publication is The City and Country, and its con-
tents are chiefly devoted to sporting topics, and to
announcements of what Mr. Ward has for sale in his
capacity of auctioneer—a new phase of existence into
which, it seems, he has lately blossomed. Ebby—as
they call him in Adelaide—is “ one of the most remark-
able men in the country, sir.” He is of pleasant ap-
pearance, and when Minister of Education—he has
been Minister of nearly everything in his time—his
principal peouliarity was, that he was always to be
found everywhere but in his office. For a while he and
SkeflUgton Carroll, of the Lantern, were bosom friends,
but they had a row over some drinks at the Globe,
when Carroll cartooned him as a ram, branded with
the letters 1.0 U. Ebby, however, rose to the occasion.
For, on the following week, he subsidised another
paper to produce exactly the same ram, only with
Bkeffington’s head, and instead of the I.O.U. brand, the
broad arrow. Though not a particularly sparkling
journalist, Mr. Ward is a man of a general all-round
brilliancy ; but he carries no weight excepting with the
free selectors and farmers, who have retained him to
Parliament in the face of colossal difficulties, time after
time. The swell hotel of Adelaide—Gunsler’s—is
directly facing the House, and Ebenezer is to be heard
telling his friends prior to an important debate how he
is going to pitch into other members, and often re-
hearsing, for their delectation, portions of his address
whioh he considers to be of a more than ordinarily
eloquent description. Personally, Ebby is good-natured,
and will do a lot to serve a friend — if it costs
nothing.
The editor of the Wilcannia Grazier has been
converted. He prints this paragraph:—“ Except in
Wilcannia, Thursday last was observed at all the Angli-
can churches as a day for hnmiliation and prayer for
rain, and (except in Wilcannia) heavy tains fell through-
ont the colony on Friday." You see, Wilcannia is a
place where they never did get much rain, and are
never likely to get much. Wilcannia is the place, too,
where the inhabitants are so mercenary and incredulous
that they refuse to pay a parson liberally. And as, of
course, no parson will work unless he is paid liberally,
Wilcannia is at present without an ecclesiastic to bang
the tom-tom in drought-time. Onoe the people used to
shell-out to a duly-ordained rain-beater; but as they
found he was positively unable to effect any change
whatever in the Divine plans, even thongh they helped
him to the extent of praying till they bad corns on
their knees, they said that as the average parson
was a man utterly inferior in mental calibre to
the average merchant’s clerk, they would, if
they subsidised " the cloth" at all, only pay say £250
a year for the privilege of having in their midst a white
tie. So Wilcannia is now rainless and parsonless. All
this reminds us that Mr. Jones, the jovial mayor of
Glen Innes, is now in Sydney. He is a smart, dapper,
little-big man, with genuine hnmonr stamped on his
determined, genial countenance. He is the author of
the now celebrated epistle in which the Mayor of Glen
Tones respectfully, bat firmly, declined to accept the
“ Vioe-preaidentship”of the local “ brass hand." Well,
some years ago, when the watercourses about Glen
lanes were all running bankers, Jones read in the news-
papers that Bishop Barker had fixed up a day of
“ humiliation and prayer," with a view to the ameliora-
tion of the drought, whioh was at the time pretty
general all over the colony. So he sat him down, and
wired the Bishop thus I respectfully request your
Lordship to restrain the clergy of at least this district
from praying for rain, or humiliating themselves in any
way calculated to bring down more water. Rivers and
creeks up here level with banks. In my capacity as
coroner, I last week held four inquests on bodies of
drowned men. Should any farther local deaths be
attributable to floods, I shall hold your Lordship per-
sonally responsible. Jones, Mayor of Glen lanes." The
poor old credulous loss rain-boater squirmed.
That great small comedian, Frederick Marshall,
has had but a sorry time of it for the past month.
Ready dressed and made-up to go on the stage, one
night, little distant Frederick fell into a dead faint,
utterly broke down, was physicked and blistered in his
dressing-room at the Bijou Theatre, and sent home
straight. Managerial worry had capped professional
overwork, and Marshall was in a half-demented state
for many days. He was restless all day, raved all night,
and exhibited a most dangerous and pitiable mental
condition. The doctors met in solemn consultation,
and ordered Frederick complete test for twelve months
and a long sea-voyage—insisting, moreover, that their
commands should be carried out at once. From any
point of view, the collapse was heart-breaking. Bo far
the season had not been any great financial success;
but Onp-week was coming, and people who know Mel-
bourne are aware of what Cup-week means for the
theatres in that city. Frederick had rented a comfort-
able honse, five miles out of town, kept ponies, a
brougham, and oow, and all the luxuries which beset
the theatrical artist when he fades into expensive rus-
ticity. He intended to live on those charming promises
with that jolly wife of his, and continue to receive any
decent guest who might find his way thither tor some
years. He meant to settle down in Australia; to make
himself a colonist; to feel thoroughly at home, as
thongh he had never known what it was to drudge
through small parts at Home for thirty shillings a weak,
and fancy himself blest in having the chance of so doing.
He intended to secure and produce all the new comedies
which were worth a show, and, as a consequence, many
which were not. His purpose was to take his entire
company, scenery, and properties over to Adelaide
next month, and surprise and astonish the South
Australians with performances ef snob a class and
ganged to such a standard as Adelaide yearns for, but
never gets. He intended—but, there—what is the use P
The pretty house had to be broken up—the ponies sold
—the servants discharged—the pleasant surroundings
and intentions abandoned—and Australia itself left
behind. Of course, the sudden ending of Frederick
Marshall’s season was inconvenient and disappointing
to the members of his company, who were all engaged
till March next. The principal members, such as
Titheradge—always a gentleman—never dreamt of
making war on an invalid for amounts whioh might,
under that engagement, be formally due. Bat some
understrappers thought otherwise. Those from whom
such a course was least warranted—those who had been
treated with exceptional kindness by their actor-
manager—who had received the benefit of his incessant
tuition in their business, and a better salary than any
other manager would have given—those people attacked
Marshall with threats of action, with writs, and endea-
vours to arrest. Their unkindly proceedings were con-
cealed from him by friends at hand, who persuaded
him to leave Melbourne quietly overland. It was only
when at Adelaide, and reading the ordinary press tele-
grams, that Frederick knew what his erstwhile hangers-
on were doing. Ho had partially recovered then,
but the anxious time whioh ensued nearly brought
about a relapse into that distressing state of want of
mental balance to whioh he had previously almost
succumbed. However, say what folks will. Heaven is
kinder than soi disant histrions; so, eventually, there
was no need to return to Melbourne voluntarily, as at
one time he determined, or involuntarily as his enemies
threatened. Mrs. Marshall and Edmund joined him at
Adelaide, and, last Saturday, the latter returned to
Melbourne, while the others, attended by the faithful
Friedmann, left for England per Orient steamer Liguria.
Frederick intends to enjoy complete holiday in his
rose-covered oottage on the Yorkshire hills, and pro-
poses, when completely restored, to return to Australia.
From a communication received from Peter
Campbell, Esq., the eminent wrestler with Satan, we
are more than ever confirmed in our opinion that he is
“ off his kadoova." His letter is a most terrific produc-
tion, both in language and appearance,—the latter,
were the epistle not indited by so holy a man, would
suggest that he had taken more zoedone than was good
for him. Such pattes de mooches were never seen since
the copy of Horace Greeley, and the tenor of the letter
is quite as eooentrio as the ealigraphy. He tells us
that he is about to bring out a shilling pamphlet. It
will, he says, “ be a gonial, kindly, tender (sic), humor-
ous, and eminently readable production. Of course I
will do the whole of the writing myself. . . . Please
kindly abuse the brochure beforehand." We don’t see
how we can well do this, since we know nothing about
it, excepting what Mr. Campbell has told us ; and how-
ever we may pin our faith to the Gospel according to
St. Luke (for instance), we are by no means disposed to
blindly believe in that according to Peter. We don’t
really cate about the intelligence that Peter is bringing
out a pamphlet, since the works from his pen
which have hitherto come under our notice
have been about as long as a collect, and
rather less entertaining. What we should really like to
hear from Peter, though, is his experience of the
matrimonial state, with a dissertation on the habits
and customs of British “widdors." There is a cruel
story going the round of Melbourne whioh we should
be glad to see the rev. gentleman indignantly deny.
The reason for the now historic separation of the happy
(!) pair has been given as follows:—On the day after
the nuptials, Mrs. Peter requested to be supplied with
funds wherewith to purchase the festive banquet. The
holy husband, after some consideration, drew ont
eighteenpence. The dinner was purebased, and it is
hardly needful to say entirely disappeared. In the cool
calm of the even of springtime, Peter enquired the
cost of the meal. It was found to have exceeded the
sum doled out by 4<L Peter then packed up his bag-
gage in his hat and indignantly left, declaring that he
would not sit by and be ruined by the reckless extrava-
gance of any woman. We can scarcely credit this of

Wolseley A London paper relates that James
Williams, “the last of the Marines, who served at
Trafalgar,” has pegged out at Leyton, in Essex, at the
age of 100 years and six months. It is now Dubbo’s
time to refute this scandal and rake up another “ last
veteran.” When recovering from his illness
ocaasioned by bad drainage at Sandringham, the Prince
of Wales made the only good saying with which ha ia
credited. He said:—“ If I were not a Prince I would
be a plumber." Major-General George Dean-Pitt has
bean appointed Keeper of the Crown Jewels at the
Tower of London, as successor to Colonel John Cox
Gawler. Major Dean-Pitt had charge in 1859 of the
formation and organisation of the Victorian Volunteer
Force. In 1863, he was commissioned by the New
Zealand Government to raise local forces to assist the
British troops against the Maoris. Ho was a partici-
pator in the fights at Okotuku, Putaki, Otapawa,
Waikato, and the march through Taranaki Forest
The Brisbane Telegraph recently published a letter
stating that the veteran oompo.. Campbell, who re-
cently deserted his “ frame ” for a better “ forme," was
not the father of the Queensland Press, and that a
William Boyd was employed on the Courier as
journeyman long before Campbell. Boyd, who ia still
in the trade, writes to the Maryborough Chronicle
denying this, and stating that Campbell was an appren-
tice in the Courier office when he joined. Boyd ia 76
years of age, and says he has “ never risen from the
common level from lack of influence." Mr. Walter
Duffleld, of the firm of Duffield and Co., millers, &c., of
Gawler, died on Sunday. He was member for Barossa

years ago, but lately has eschewed Parliamentary

Although the xnu&io of Audran’a opera is not
easy to catch, the popularity of the production is by
no means difficult to explain. In the title-role, fob
instance, lots of opera-bouffe artists could be imported
who could sing the numbers better than Maggie Moore,
Put where are you going to find the party who
is to improve upon her impersonation—as a whole?.
They don’t make em often. And when they do, they don’t
travel/ Then take Nellie btewart. Nellie is a pretty
type of an entirely different kind of actress. Who is
picturesque, and, therefore, pop-u-lar. And, conse-
quently, there are not many Nellie Stewarts flying
about. And then Maggie—another of the family.
Maggie, in a morning costume waiting to “ clutch it ”
on Treasury-day, is a delightful spectacle; but Maggie,
at night-time, in sky-blue tights, is a thing to dream of
we mean, of course, to pleasantly dream of. No
sarcasm, while we live, on this subject 1 And Harwood!
No words can express the mad fun he makes out of the
Hake's part. He is a sly dog and a cruel; and by firing
off nightly batteries of the most execrable puns and
marrow-curdling “locals,” he is evidently conspiring
to break the heart of the poor wretch who is writing
the Pantomime ! No; you can’t beat “ The Mascotte."
It is a splendid production all through. Why, there's
Woodfleld, who is a musical box on legs: -he is a big
draw —and Verdi 1 —aheml —oh, and that reminds us.
At a quarter to ten the other night, a big livery servant
left for him at the stage-door the following note :—
“ Signor Verdi, — I love you and am rich; but
there is a bar to our being happy. Do not ask me
what the bar is ; and never, 1 conjure you, intrude
upon me in my walks on Manly Beach, from half-
past ten to half-past eleven My address is ,
but if you dare to write I will never forgive you.
‘ Euphrosine."
To this billet,/the fascinating Pippo returned the fol-
lowing dignified reply : —
« Madame,—Your letter to me is in English, the
barbaric English tongue. I do not understand it.
Your communication is, therefore, an enigma. Ad-
dress me, in future, in the softest Tuscan. I am
nothing if not Italian.
“ Guglielmo Verdi.”
• # *
So, of course, “La Masootte” (to vary it) will
run until the pantomime, for which, by the way, Sam.
Toole has been engaged to play an aboriginal. There
will be, indeed, a great cast, and it is rumoured that the
management have secured the services of E. Lewis
Heott, Esq , to play Baradas, between the acts.
* ** *
We wouldn’t like to say where the editor of the
Wide Bay and Burnett News will go to. He has a
par. beginning: “ We are glad to welcome among us
■ once more, Kainer’s Panorama of the American and
Eusso-Turkish War." There is something so calm and
awful about tbis editorial “Mahooder" that it nearly
- approaches the sublime.

Warrior Brown does the Melbourne Theatre

they call him Warrior because he his whisky

funniness into the pantomime, it must be a howling
i success.

We have received a telegram from the Mastodon
IMinstrels, from Maitland, in which they say they are
'doing a splendid business. They are going to play all

tiue way, they must be twius. The crowd left Sydney
Ob IPxiday night for Newcastle after the performance,

jyr, v a<ii.y’.s Bum, we read: —“Ou Saturday night the

The People’s Concerts at the Temperance Hall,
on Saturday nights, are h great attraction. You can go
in there, and have a co«P»e of “beers between the
acts for a shilling. It is a chaste entertainment-sooth-
ing and genteel. We will.lot add pleasing, because
we hear that Mrs. Colborne- Eraser wears a thick-soled
No. 2 shoe; and she can thrOW it. What we object to
in the entertainment, however, is that they don t give
you enough of it. All you get is nineteen items, in-
cluding two overtures! Tbis, wfl consider, is but an
indifferent sixpenn’orth for sober people. Wa went
expecting to get a three-act drama after the musical
olio, with plenty of combats and a nice little girl to do
the Highland fling in the second entr’ acte. There were
sweets, however, mixed with the sours. Not having
seen Mr. H Irving for some years, when he was per-
forming in “The Bells,” we were glad lo welcome him
as a comic vocalist, iu the song of “ The Policemen."
Harry Jackson also, whom we last saw playing in
** Drink " at the Princess’s is, we are charmed to see,
making quite a hit in the Temperance Hall, warbling
the “ Noble 21th,” and the “ Boat’s Going Over.”
There will be extra attractions on Saturday next when
've see that there will be “the first appearance in
Australia of Madam (sic) Bella Percy;” and we also
learn that the celebrated tenor from Pernambuco, Mr.
A. Tippin,” will likewise awpear. “ The London Lion
tepecialist, Mr. E. G. Wickens," is likewise underlined.

Duncan Ma oullum’a crowd have completely got
the Auckland people in “ Tambour Major,’ ’ and we are
very glad to hear i i.. The venture was a big one, and a
plucky one, aafl we like to see enterprise succeed. We
have always been en terprising ourselves, ever since we
started in the com me. tcial line by buying pea-nuts with
another lodger’s morie T- “ Billee Taylor ” is to succeed
“Tambour Major,” d tie gu’il parait (we mustn’t use this
phrase too often i), and hi connection with this opera
there is a strange circpi i stance. Mr. Williamson tells
us that the reason of its non-success at the Princess’s,
in Melbourne, was that 1 he libretto failed to appeal to
the risible faculties of th e audience. The dialogue, in
fact, being, so Mr. J. C. c 'onsidered, of a very inferior
description. And yet the book was written by no less
a person than Mr. Pottin|e r Stephens, a very prominent
art critic on the staff of tl ie London 1 imes. In order
to make the opera go here, not only, it is said, will new
songs require to be written, but the dialogue entirely
re-dished for the colonial i >alate. Yet this piece ran
nearly six months in Londo n! Which is it r Are we
very difficult to satisfy out hi ire, or can’t we appreciate
real humour? Quisait? Thi -re is one comfort. The
management know when to pu t their hands on a gentle-
man (in spectacles) who wil 1 improve on Pottinger.
After this, we are inclined, glorying in the super-
abundance of our literary talen t, to ejaculate with Mr.
Hannibal Choliop ; “We are a i nodel to the airth, and
must be jist cracked up.”
We are a gentle paper, an A if we truly love
anything besides our prayers, it in sending along
young artistes who genuinely de wrvo it. We never
knew an artist yet who “ cared wh atthe papers said
—bat to us this feeling of indifieri too e to journalistic
opinions is indifferent. When we have a duty to per-
form we do it calmly, despite all de; dakm—in the tenth,
of contempt 1 We mast therefore sa y ti iat Miss Marie
St. Clair has vastly improved in her art since she gave
us the first touch of her quality as Azuoena in the

Turners); ba her sister Madeleine, w ho nu de her dibut
—not “ deoSo,” boys 1 —in opera as tl le Qua en in “ The
Royal Middy ” has really exhibit* id tale uts which
entitle her to be considered as quite a coming ■ sensation.

things that Miss Melville can teach herdihen Miss
Madeleine will bo able to appear in the “thretf shooters"

Arthur Garner has arrived, and of wh*£ is of
more importance, so has Joe Goodman, who is, we
believe, going to take Goodie’s place for a bit, wliile Q.
L. has a spell. Goodie is not. well He never is
vwell somehow when he has to pay the salaries of so
many picturesque pages, Jee created quite a sensation
in Castlereagh-street when he ar rived. His hat —a white
one of startliug proportions—wits the theme of general
admiration.. When he went into the office, Musgtove
said —“ Where those pigeons you have brought for
me?" “All right," said Joe i. “in my hat *’ _ “ I
hope you have’nt forgotten the case of whisky

reply, “ so I lent ’em to a couple of friends who wanted
a trip by water. They are sailing them round, and will

Friday will be th© last night of “ The Royal
Middythen “ Girofk-Girofla.” at the Opera House.
We have seen the fascinating Emelie frequently in the
part of the twin sisters; and she is as piquante now as
she was then. “ Girofk '* is the finest thing Miss Mel-
ville does; and she ought te draw all the town. When
people see her get “ tight” in the second act, the example
is so strong that the pit gets speechless in the third.
Armes Beaumont will, of course, be Marasquin—which,
we trust to heaven, he won’t call Marasquine; and
Farley, Mourzouk. Cassefli will represent the old Baron
whi escaped from his dungeon by boring a hole through
the floor with his penknife, and afterwards went about
playing the trombone. All this should be very funny.
We shall go there most especially. So, dear W.J., we
shall have once more to ask you to show an old lady
and her flat-iron the usual courtesy.
Frank Towers’ crowd has played “ London
Assurance" for two nights, and last night (Wednesday)
produced the “Two Orphans.” We unfortunately
were prevented from assisting at the representation of
Boucioacflt’s comedy, and to-morrow being a holiday,
we are obliged to hold over a notice of “ Two Orphans,"
which by-fche-way. Hanks’ three-sheaters inform ns
was written by Mr. Oxenberry. “ The ‘I wo Orphans,"
is strongly oastj Bosa playing Louise, and Miss Emma
Bronton Henriette. The interest of the piece, how-
ever, will no doubt centre in the performance of the
part of Genevieve by Miss Theresa Horan. Genevieve
has, if anything, rather lese to say inLesDeuxOrphelines
than Desdemona has in Othello; bat for all that, when
ev«n a comparatively subordinate part is entrusted to
the truly talented, it may be made—as doubtless it
will in this case—to stand out in bold relief from all
the other characters. Why, when she belonged to the
Comedie Franyaise, Sara Bernhardt was often east in a
minor part herself. And she invariably made a hit.
And if Sara did well with a small role, what may we not
expect of Theresa I Frank is the Prerre of the drama
and Cates the Armong. Mr. Q. Lestrango enacts the
Marquis de Presles— and we humbly hope when wo go
they won’t make “Presles" rhyme to “tressles"—
and Mr. Q. B. Ireland the “ Jark,” We shall go often
to see this. We want to get up our French.
* * * *
By-the-way, talking of the Towers, it reminds
us that, in “Maggie’s Dream," Miss Adelaide T., an
actress who could lose herself in the thumb of the
glove of a certain old gentleman we know, used to sing
a little character song with great effect. She repre-
sented in her ditty the five phases of woman, and her
assumption of the widow, especially, was great fun.
When her turn was over, we went round to congratulate
Miss Adelaide, and, after a long search, found her
asleep in Rosa’s thimble.

The Montagne-Tnrner crowd seem to have
broken np their season suddenly and mysteriously at
Tamworth, in the papers of which lively township we
have (read varied —very varied —accounts of their
successes. The languishing Scantlebury has 1 taken
down his proprietors for a shilling ki the following
wire :—“Orange, Tuesday—Open here, Saturday,
‘ Maritana.* Dubbo. next Wednesday." This wasn’t
all, but it’s quite enough fer us.
The second subscription concert of the Western
Suburbs Musical Society was held last week. Dis-
appointment was felt at the omission of Mozart’s
quintette. Mendelssohn’s instrumental quartette was,
however, well appreciated. Two male chorusses, “ The
German Fatherland," and “Marching Homeward,"
were fairly sung. The singers apparently, tried to
imagine themselves a Liedertafel, but —not yet. “ O’er
the hill, o'er the dale." by two ladies, obtained the first
encore, and later on, one of the singers was very sweet
in “ Close to the Threshold," with flute obligato. A
young lady who sang “ A bister’s Faithful Love " has
a nice voice, which, with training and attention to
details, may some day prove all it promises. Much of
the success) was due to the conductor, Mr. Hector
M’Lean.
The proposed benefit to Mrs. Emilie Barrington,
the well-known pianiste, has been postponed owing to
that lady’s indisposition.
Poor George Francis Train (who was once an
Australian colonist) is now a white-haired street
vagrant in New York.
The fun this (Thursday) afternoon will be to run
out to Corria’s Gardens, and dance at the German
picnic. Host Dick Thatcher slings the whiskv on the
occasion.
The Hon. Ivo Bligh’a team are to be entertained
by the Oxford and Cambridge University men of
Sydney. 'Varsity men who wish to take part in this

Hobnobbing with an Ambassador.
Hk was a swarthy-looking gentleman with a large dis-
play of gold chain, and a mouth that was, next to the
opening of the Argyle Cut, the nearest thing we ever
remember seeing to the cavern of the now departed Billy
Wilson. His voice, though he was of small stature, was the
voice of a giant; and his dusky features were convulsed by
a perpetual smile. He was loaded with newspapers, reports,
and other documents, all in more or less a picturesque
condition of griminess; and he was equally full of business
and of good humour. This was no less a person than
Sydney Taiwhanga, one of the Maori ambassadors. His
Excellency had just arrived by the “ Austral” in company
w?th Hakena something and another plenipotentiary,
whose ancestors, by the sound of his name, seem to have
been having a lark with the language. They went home
to see the Queen about some land dispute, but somehow
or other Her Majesty was always out when they called,
and on those occasions upon which she drove to their hash
establishment, it invariably happened that they were
either seeing the sights with the Archbishop of Canter-
bury’s daughter, or praying at the head quarters of the
Aborigines’ Protection Society. So they didn’t see the
Queen after all; which, on the whole, we are inclined
to think was a good thing for their peace of mind, since
they had only formed their ideas of Her Majesty from
the engravings in the British Workman, in which pub-
lication she is—to quote Joe Gargery—“drawed too
architectooralooral.”
• * *
The ambassadors on arrival first put up at the Champion
Hotel, but as they considered £10 for four days “ too hot,”
—Taiwhanga’s words—they moved to a boarding-house
7 Shad well-street, MidcHeton-square, in which haven they
were boarded for £3 a week each ; and had the additional
advantage of being Watched by the missionaries in order
that they shouldn’t get out after 7 o’clock at night. But
Hakena used to give his sentinels the slip, and hie away to
mix with the giddy throng, returning with the milk in the
morning. Taiwhanga, however, said that if more than
one had thus far outraged human nature, it would
have “ burst up the mission.” In the end this was
successful—Lord Kimberley fixing the affair up, and
ambassadors returning home (rejoicing. They started, it
seems, with £-#00, and we, having heard some rumours
about Mrs. Taiwhangaibeing very hard up while her lord
was away v asked that gentleman for an explanation.
His Excellency brought his book out like a flash, and
pointing triumphantly to an item, said—“ There ! See !
I left her £14 ! Besides, there was two tons of gum in my
hut.” We told him that as the Embassy had only been
away 5 months, the fact of his having left that comfortable
sum] at once cleared up all doubts as to the laxity of his
domestic arrangements and his duty as a husband. It was
then that he informed us that somebody liked rum,
and had got on a “tear.”

While in London, they were splendidly taken up by the
swell church lot—visiting Sir Wilfrid Lawson, the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury, Mr. Rath bone, M.P., and scores of
others. Young A. S. Rathbone, of the Auckland Ob-
server, who is at present in London, slyly recommended
them to go to the Aquarium—a rather giddy place
of resort, but this was sternly vetoed by Rathbone
the member. Taiwhanga’s note-book is a highly in-
teresting affair. The addresses of all the swells he has
met are copied therein, but as some enthusiast has sand-
wiched their names with inscriptions copied from a
number of tombstones, the pages of the work are a bit
confusing at first sight. For instance, on one leaf we
see “ Miss Church, the tall, fair daughter of the Dean of
St. Paul’s” (“she wanted me to sit next to her at
dinner,” Taiwhanga explained); at the top of one page and
just under it, “ A servant of Jesus Christ, and preacher
of the covenant of peace then, ranked next to “ Miss
Ellen Duck ” is “ He that goes a borrowing, goes a sor-
rowing an entry which is susceptible, no doubt, of a
copious explanation. “ Miss Tait, The Palace, Addington
Park, Croydon,” shone on one page, and “ Theodore and
Mrs. Fry, Esq.,” on another. Then, next to that rather
bizarre entry, we read, “It takes two to make a
quarrel !”
* * *
We had quite a long talk with Taiwhanga, and we are
really very much obliged to our friends, the missionaries,
for sending him round. He speaks capital English, and as
he neither smokes nor drinks, he is inexpensive to enter-
tain. Indeed, we liked him so much that we would have
kept him longer than we did, had not we recognised, at
intervals, during our interview with his Excellency, the
impatient knock of a well-known dignitary of the church,
who has conceived a passion for our tobacco.
DENOMINATIONAL DROPS.
Here is a list of sermon-titles (titles of the kind
of sermons affected by the people who sang Ta'e and
Brady) collected from an American library : —“ The
Snuffers of Divine Love “ The Spiritual Mustard-pot

Cards to Win Christ ;" “ Crumbs of Comfort for

from the Breasts of Both Testaments;” "Matches
Lighted at the Divine Fire."
“ The fortnightly free breakfasts, given by the
City Mission, at Adelaide, are proving to bo a great

tentively listened to by an increasing crowd."
The Archbishop and his olargy do not “ hit it ”
very well. There has been a big row between hie Qrace
and Dean Leonard. Roger Bede wanted the Dean to
pay something like £700 towards the cost of furnishing
a residence for the Marist Brothers at St. Mary’s, the
other city parishes being also taxed. The Very Rev.
Thomas had a heavy debt to pay on his Sacred
Heart school, and he told the Archbishop the clerical
equivalent of “ seeing him to blazes " before he would
ante up " the £700. A day «r two afterwards, the
Dean received a note from his Holiness Doctor Sheridan
infornVng him lhat ho had been "granted twelve
months leave of absence." The Sacred Heart people
are highly indignant.

PEPPER AND SALT.
The rules for the guidance of the E.C. clergy of
Northern Queensland are just to hand, from the pen of
the eminent Vicar-Apostolic, Dr. Fortini. They are
couched in very simple language, and are decidedly
“straight" in sentiment. For instance20, No
priest shall be allowed to wear a gold chain on the vest
or divide the hair of the head.” This, to our mind,
verges on the tyrannical. If such a rule were in force
amongst the Church of England clergy for six months,
how the ranks of the curates would thin, and how the
numbers of the barbers would increase! No. 21, also,
seems to us to verge on the arbitrary, though having in
view what a giddy old boy Dr. Fortini’s countryman,
Cardinal Antonelli, turned out to have been-however—
here’s the section “ No priest shall be allowed to
have a female servant or housekeeper under the age of
forty, except she is one of his near relations.” The age
only is mentioned here; but there seems to be no oh-
jeotion to her being either fair, or fat, or both—and, as
a natural consequence, fair and fat, ond forty. This
rule, however, would only prove distasteful to those
who gauged female beauty by Tom Pinch’s ideal; but
in the case of Tom’s friend, the coachman who helped
him to dispose of that "platonic basket,” and who
remarked "I don’t care for ’em when they’re too
young, myself,” the arrangement as to the age of a
housekeeper would, of oenrse, be singularly attractive.
We have a kind of idea, though, that in a general way
the clergy of all denominations are Tom Punohites upon
this delicate question. We are.

The letter-carriers’ new pants have been issued
to them, and they contain no pockets. The postmen,
therefore, consider themselves insulted, and sneeringly
suggest that, if the Government limits them to pocket-
lees pants, the sorting-clerks should be made to wear
kilts. We don’t endorse this at all. Wo only knew
one sorting-clerk, and he was a good young man who
used to punish a planner at charity concerts. We have
lost sight of that young man lately. He has probably
gone to heaven—that’s to say, the bnnday-sohool books
say so j but we have heard that he is in Darling hurst.

A barman at Yorketown, S.A., is the winner of
the £2000 sweep on the Melbourne Cup. We know
Yorketown well, and we know the barman, too. He is
a little man, with a watery eye and a fur cap. Or,
rather, he was. Now ho is a big man, in a shiny “ Jack
Lankester,” a gold ring, and an eye-glass. He will, of
course, buy the hotel, and be the recipient of an address
eulogistic of his " public-spirited ” conduct. Cela va
sans dire. Then he will probably die. That is, if he
have that within him which elevates him from the
common herd. We only wish we had time to take a
ran up to Yorketown to grovel. It is getting a long
time since we did a good old refreshing crawl.

An old lady living about ten miles from Jackeroo
recently bought a lot of matches in the towr ship; but
discovering that she couldn’t strike them, she carted
the whole bundle back to the storekeeper. “Poob,”
said the man of moles, " there’s nothing the matter
with these luoifers. They’re all right. See.” And
drawing one of them sharply down the leg of bis panta-
loons, he got an immediate blaze. Then he took an-
other, and yet another, with a like effect. The old lady
gazed pensively on this proceeding for some moments,
and then said, “ That’s all very well, mister; but j
can’t be coming all the way from my place to strike
matches on your leg. It's a question, too, if my old
man would like it. They’re pertickler in onr church.”
This is a fa But no! They’re,!particular in onr

Tommy Martin, an aboriginal “identity” of
Maryborough (Q), has gone over-or rather down,
since he toppled over into the Mary while reaching out
for " one fellow bob ” which a passenger on board the
Keilawarra was offering him. He was decorated, was
Tommy, and went down in full military uniform, his
medal being hung round his neck and his head greased.
Tommy Martin sleeps in peace,
His spear no more he’ll hump it;

« Gospel.” Hebald.” We think we know the man who
put this in. He has five meals dally, and takes seven
ups of tea with each. His snblimest joke is to make
cabman drive him to the extreme limits of possibility
or a shilling; and he considers it to be an intensely
humorous thing to get into a 'bus, and when you’ve
taken a sixpenny fare out of the vehicle, to suddenly
remember you’ve left your money at home. He wears
a tall, hard bell-topper, very short pants, a prim black
tie, shaves his upper lip, and when in church he breathes
very hard into his hat, as when feeding he breathes
very hard over his plate. If he is fortunate enough to
entrap that " able youth,” the unlucky clerk will per-
ceive before long that his duties only begin in the
advertisement, to end in the washus. He will be always
suavely spoken to, and will have free access to the out-
side of the safe, and be allowed his full swing at the
pump. Then, after a year or two, the “ able youth’’
will go mad,;and “Gospel” will be found one day strewn
all over his office. If the billet should not be filled up.
we will send “ an able youth" round to take it. He
won't, perhaps, be extra great in his salesmanship,
book-keeping, correspondence, and shorthand—but he
will be able to manage the strewing.

Wo used to hear a good deal, before we got bald
and commenced to evince a fondness for snuff, of the
“language of flowers." We don’t care for the floral
language now, being mere interested in the rise and fall
of “ best fresh " and the fluctuations in the market of
children’s boots. Besides, even if we were still romantic,
we should be seduced away from the language of flowers
by the language of cricket. The following chaste and
eloquent epistle from the hon. secretary of one Sydney
cricket club to that of another has especially dazzled us :
•* Sir
«I was not aware of me sending you a challance
(sic) but still we will paly (sic) you on next satur-
day to meet at moore Park gate at i to three to
play for a now ball or 8/6."

the lily. Quito an ethereal glow overspreads us as we
read it. We (eel almost as happy as when we are at the
Association Ground, and they are “ handing round the

To-day (Thursday) is the anniversary of the
birth of Field-Marshal H.B.H. the Prince of Wales
It is, therefore, the duty of everyone to rejoice, and to
drink the noble warrior’s health in as much beer as
can be comfortably accommodated. And, so far as
beer goes, the accommodation of the Sydney public is
only equalled by its loyalty. We are very loyal our-
selves, and, in honour of the occasion, shall moat
certainly sacrifice to onr suffering country to the extent
of either taking “ her” to Botany or assisting at the
Temperance Picnic. We like to honour valour in any
form; and where there is no valour, we are quite con-
tent to crawl to either rank or royalty. The Prince of
Wales we especially delight to honour. Net because he
-a .either) especially brave or brilliantly clever, but
because we have been brought up to respect and revere
“ the Queen and all tbe Eoyal family," in the same
manner that we pray on Sunday for 11 all priests and
deacons,” though we are not quite'clear at this
moment what a deacon is. If he be one of those gaunt
parties at the Congregational whe snavel your shilling
with a sinister smile, why then we take our prayers
back. We can’t afford to lavish our supplications on
such a hard-headed lot. To return to the Prince of
Wales, however. Outside the divinity which is supposed
to encircle a king there isn't much in him. He may be
best described as a stout young man who makes bad
speeches. When much younger, “ Wales" had no par-
ticular forehead in front, but now he has a very exten-
sive one behind. H £ H. does not understand anything
particularly. His greatest accomplishment consists
in taking off his hat. You can’t beat him at that.
Limit him only to taking off his hat, and he
shines. Of his conversation, it has been truly said that
he can converse with equal intelligence upon any
subject. When he goes to lay a foundation-stone or
"pen a museum, either Sir William Knollys or
Charley ’’—Lord Charles Beresford—“ put him up to
it ” in the train. It has been our happy lot to hear
the Prince make many speeches. Here's his style,
verbatim Mister Mayor—er—and gentle— men,— It
is with peculiar pleasure that I have—er—accepted
your invitation to lay the foun isn’t it ?—Oh, te
open your Town Hall—I should say. Aquarium—what,
my Lord?—I mean your Public Library, The town of
Bradford—by Bradford I mean to imply Leicester—
(cheers)—is one whose importance as a cotton centre —
cutlery—of course—at least—well, Mr. Mayor—pleasing
duty—the Queen much gratified—pronounce it open.
(Cheers and band.) ” The Prince, though has a lot of
good points. He never, for instance, wears the same
pair of socks twice, and he is a great judge of several
things. Other Field-Marshals have acquired their
popularity in the camp; the Prince acquired his by
getting sick. If he’d got sicker than he was, perhaps,
he would have been more popular. However, it’s Bertie’s
birthday this morning, eolet us drink his health as
we murmur” Uonisoit quimalypense," and “Ich Uien.”
We really don’t know what they are all about, but we
feel them to be a proper thing to say on this festive
occasion.

They are going to have anOlde Englysshe Fayre
—or whatever you call it —in Melbourne, in aid of St.
Patrick’s ; and Archbishop Qoold has written over to
Dr. Vaughan for the straight griffin with regard to
“ fetching ”” Mickey.” We can tell him all about it.
In the first place, in order to start the thing, let Dr. G.
get a whole lot of names out of the Directory, and
write them a little religio-facetious letter each ; then,
when a few hundreds have come in, engage the services
of a smart young fel'ow belonging to the Austrian
Band, or some similar pious society, and give him
carte blanche as to the engagements. As long as there
are plenty of nigger-minstrel troupes. Punch and
Judys, fortune-tellers, merry-go-rounds, and other
holy recreations, the thing is bound to gee. A wax
portrait model of O’Farrell would also take well, and
if the Lord Archbishop could manage to hire his gaol-
spoon, so as to enable the public to judge as to the size
of his mouth, the speculation would not fail, we think,
to prove eminently attractive. The stall-keepers will
require to be well trained; but every two stalls will
have to be superintended by a priest, in order that the
rustic Celt with the hair on his teeth may bo entrapped
by force, if necessary. One golden rule attend to!
Give any amount of guiver, but no change. These
little matters carefully noted, plenty of Exhibition-
street whisky laid on, and we predict that the Archie-
piscopal show will be a big boom. As Dr. Qoold’a
going in for something spicy, if we chance across the
dancing dogs, or the euchre-playing mule, we will send
them along. Wo don’t care what trouble wo take
about anything, so long as it’s for the Church. Oh,
and when Dr. Goold writes autograph-letters to the
sellers of porter-gaff, as Dr. Vaughan does, requesting
a subscription, he should follow the example of the
“ bather in supernatural light” and draw in the margin
a comic little pen-and-ink sketch of Biddy holding on
to the hind leg of a pig. The porter-gall man will then
not only send a liberal donation, but carefully treasure
up the Archbishop’s epistle, and will be enabled to hand
down as an heirloom to future generations of beer-engine
workers a literary and artistic relic of the great prelate.

Of her we love, around it seetaa to shed
A golden angel-aureole.
And all her ways seem sweeter ways
Than those of other women in that lixht:
She has no portion with the pallid night.
But is a part of all fair days.
Joy goes where she goes, and good dreams—
Her smile is tender as an old romance
Of Love that dies not, and her soft eye’s glance
Like sunshine set to music seems.
Queen of onr fate is she, but crowned
With purple bearts-ease for her womanhood.
There is no place so poor where she has stoed
Bat evermoie is holy ground.
An angel from the heaven above
Would not be fair to us as she is fair:
She holds us in a mesh of amber hk ir.
This one sweet woman whom we love.
We pray thee. Love, our sou's to steep
In dreams wherein thy myrtle flowereth ;
So when the rose-leaves shiver, feeling Death
Pass by, we may remain asleep.
Asleep, with flowers in our bands.
And lips with little happy smiles apart—
Cb< ek clot e te cheek, heart beating against heart—
While ihiough Life’s sand-glass run the sands.

BRIEF MENTION.
f" According to the Yasb Tribune, the Colonial
Architect is a Mr. Barrett, and Sir Henry’s factotum is
a Mr. Culchett Wallner. The architect of the Garden
Palace was Mr. Barnett; but it ie fair to the Tabs
Joker to say that the signature of the Principal Under-
secretary is just as like Cnlcbott Wallner, or Cracked
Walnut, as it is like Critchett Walker.
The Bathurst School of Arts is now turned into
a theatre. This was, indeed, a happy thought, because
every member of the "perfesh" well knows that two
nights ef a star company in the City of the Plains
means one insolvency. What they want up there is
either a gospel tent or a circus.
We have received private in-
telligence to the effect that the

pndding d la vanilie, was Henniker
Heaton’s laugh. Ho t ho I ho 1 ho!
The other day a motor took
flight, and dashed away untenanted
np Oxford-street. And a strange
coincidence is that just before it
started Henry Barrie was seen
coming ont of the Cambridge Club
Hotel.
The Wollomai schoolmaster
has been discharged for cursing
and flogging his pupils. He will,
however, shortly be reinstated;
for he has represented to the
Government that it was in trying
to flog the curses out of his
scholars that he learned, himself,
to swear.
There is a good deal of ex-
citement now about the Amster-
dam Exhibition, and a good many
members were enquiring last night
whereabouts it was. Dash Blank,
Esq., M.F. (who hails from Lon-
don, and keeps a pub.), was able
to set the smoking-room right.
“ What 1 Don’t you know where
Amstidamis?” said he. “Why,
Amstidam is near Amstid ’Eath."
A man recently got a wife
through advertising in a Barwon
paper. He now calls round every
day, to express, we suppose, his
gratitude; but the editor is always
lying down behind the stock of
paper, coveted over with exchanges
—so as yet the interview hasn’t
taken place. When it does, it is
not improbable that there will be
a fine opening in the Never Never
country for a sparkling young jour-
nalist.
Two Victorian Shire Secre-
taries have tried suicide —
both prior to the day of audit.
Both cases were sad and similar.
Each man had “ boozed up ” for a
month, and then loaded his
mnaket. The only difference was
that one of them was too drunk
to fire, and fell over a ploughshare.
Both men were “well-known in
the district." Great sympathy is
Mt for—the owner of the plough-
share.
Listen ! Twenty years ago a
Woolloomooloo man had the option
of buying either fifty acres of land
in Woollahra, or a boat at Circular
Quay, for the enormous sum of
£12. He bought the boat, and it
was swamped and lost on its
second, trip. To-dav the land in
question is worth £15 a foot, and
that man is scooting around, ask.
ing all he meets if they really
believe there is a Purgatory for
suicides.
A man was recently found
dead in Ulladulla, and there were
signs about the corpse to
show that he had perished in great
agony. They had, it seemed, laid
the foundation of the Wesleyan
Church the day before, and watch-
ing his chance the man had “ gone
for” the bottle, which was sup-
posed to hold coin of the realm.
He prized up the stone, drew out
the flask, and discovered — the
lonal poner, the Herald, and the
Bum. Then he lay down broken-
hearted, and died.
A Melbourne bonifaoe who
has a habit of “ringing himself in
at every shout ” was recently re-
monstrated with by a squatter.
The landlord in reply, landed the
grazier a domino on the dexter
peeper, drawing the claret freely
with his diamond fawney. The
squatter then closed and pulled
ont enough of the boniface’s hair
to make a door mat with. Then,
each swearing vengeance,they were
separated. Now, they both pass
the time going about trying to
avoid one another. That’s all we
are going to say abont this muss.
Some one will nave to be killed

’Twas up at Cookbundoon, on the Lower Wol-
londilly, Albert Bunter held his shot-gun in a manner
that was silly. Ha took it, loaded, from a loft in which
it lay concealed, and meant to shoot soma cockatoos
encroaching on his field. The trigger caught in some-
thing, and the cockiee still have life; bat (with Badness
let us mourn it) he shot bis darling wife.
In a Rockhampton paper, under the heading of
“ Shaw’s Report,” one reads : " I have also sold several
bullocks, naked." If Mr. Shaw has any regard for
public morality he ought to see that in future they
have at least their ulsters on.
A man writes to the Daily Telegraph—you
know, dear public, none of us ever believe anything
which appears in that paper—saying that one of the
Infirmary doctors deliberately cut a piece of fkln from
the arm of his (the writer’s) sick child, and grafted it
on to a sore on the body of another patient. When we
need to have somebody elae’s flesh grafted on to oura,
we hope the “ graft ’’ will be a.square inch or so of the
“ cheek ” of a C.M.G.
A curious case occurred at a Northern police
court on the 25th ultimo. A family sued the local
clergyman for unlawfully detaining two geese and
twelve goslings, which had been driven into his yard
He afiirmed they were his, and was much aggrieved
when the magistrates took the evidence of six other
witnesses in preference to his word. He considered
" they are mine,” from a clergyman, ought to have
settled the matter.
In a certain town down South, a church com-
mittee is composed of two freethinkers and a well-
known public man who is supposed to attend church,
on an average, once a year! The committee met, the
other day, parson in the chair. During a hot discus-
sion on soma point of church etiquette, the parson,
jumping excitedly out of his chair, exclaimed: “I’ll
lay you ten to one, Mr. —, that your proposition is
not carried 1"
“I wish they’d have another day of Atone-
ment," cried a Circular Quay publican— "I want to get
rid of all my bad beer."
A Southern publican is anxious to achieve a
solution of the following problem :—Let A = publican,
B = three boarders, C = said boarders’ tucker and
lodging for three months, D = one veteran swallow,

slipper. Find the value of A minus (Bplus C) plus D.
From the Morning Bum :—“ Mr. W. W.
Carson, of the San Francisco Bulletin, has arrived on
a visit through (sic) Australia, for the purpose
of writing a series of articles upon the colonies for his
journal. This Bulletin is a respectable journal.” [We
may mention, for Mr Carson’s information, that the
London Daily T elegraph also is a respectable journal,
that it never gets locked np for drunkenness, and isn’t
dying of dyspepsia consequent on an undue wa°te of
saliva expended in slobbering over a Government ]
At Cookware Creek, Bateman’s Bay, lives a
red, raw, youthful Irishman, who, up to last Saturday
morning, was terribly anxious to possess a young kan-
garoo. On that morning (Saturday), after crawling on
his hands and knees, over bramble and thorns, for two
hours, he succeeded in getting between an “ old
woman" kangaroo and her "joey,” and catching the
" joey." The “ old woman,” however, came to the
rescue. When he came back to his mate—looking like
a man who had been passed through a saw-mill, and
carrying what remained of his shirt and trensers in his
hat —he told him that before he left the old country,
there was not a man in Fermanagh could take a fallout
of him, but that the blashted old “faymale” seemed
to know more about shoulder holds and cross buttocks
than he did himself.
Mr. Dillon says that in seven-tenths of the

It was in King-street, near thejRuM office. The
poor fellow was suffering from a frightful attack of
rheumatism, and oouldn’t stand. Ha grasped a lamp,
post. “ Ah, sir,” ho murmured to the Samaritan who
came to his assistance; “this is acute rheumatism.’*
The Samaritan soon found that rheumatism cost 81.

yon a hand.’’ “ Oh, don’t,’* ha said, “ lend mo (hie)

A writer in the Weekly
Shroud has a very thin story. He
says that a woman in a railway
carriage offered him a drink of
square gin, and he refused it.
There is a crispness about this
little fiction which reminds ns of
Miss Baldroubadour’s most suc-
cessful efforts in the Arabian
Nights Entertainments. "Splendid
legend—splendid lie.”
The Narellan correspondent
of the Herald reports in that
journal that, while a Mr. Monk
and his sons were riding, a ball of
fire, “the size of a cask” (I) de-
scended near them, and went off
with a bang. “The trees did not
appear to bo injured, but smoke
accompanied with a strong sul-
phurous smell, pervaded the place
for a few minutes afterwards."
That’s all the Old Girl said about
it. Nothing was hinted at about
the Missionary who was discovered
a little later to be boiling his quart-
pot in the next paddock.
This is the sort of stuff—it is

Alfred has been shown by
some farceurs a petrified cat, and
he is naturally interested in the
phenomenon. The proprietor of
the house in which the cat was
found “ recollects having missed a
cat ” fourteen years ago. After
this, no - one can question the
authenticity of the animal—except-
ing, always, those who borrowed a
similar article from a private
museum, and were waiting round
the corner smiling cavernous
smiles while the man who had
drawn the lot had “ gone in ” with
the feline fossil. The discovery of
the cat is interesting, however,
if only to show that newspaper
enterprise is not unknown in the
colony. We await now, with some
anxiety, an item anent a pig-faoed
or a musical mule. And
if we don’t hear about either of
these, we shall call on Alfred with
a hair-trunk, and get something
slipped in about the marvellous
discovery of a two-handled horse.
There has been another little
Incident occurring at Polynesia. A
Maryborough schooner, with a lot.
of “return boys,” being short cf
rum and anxious to return, planked
her cargo of niggers down on the
wrong island. The natives wel-
comed their visitors with great
warmth, and, several big fires hav.
ing been lighted on the beach, the
f nests were peacefully devoured,
roceeding on her voyage, this
particular schooner met another,
the Government agent on board of
which had a head in two pieces
owiog to a little difference (in
which a tomahawk figured) with
a “ recruit.” Several of her boys
who had been sent ashore for
water had been likewise discussed
by the natives, and the captain
was a little anxious about a mus-
ket-ball which he had good reason
to consider was concealed in the
region of his shoulder-blade. Sub-
sequently, a mutiny took place, in
consequence of the Government
agent refusing to allow tho
“ cargo ” to eat the mate, and it
was not quelled before six of the
niggers were killed, and an equal
number missing. It will be seen
by these cheerful little incidents
that there is plenty of life in the
recruiting trade yet. Indeed, next
to the black-pickling branch of the
Missionary profession, we are constrained to consider it
second alone in the excitements of its details to the—
law.

Alderman Playfair has a mean idea of the city

tor that valuable portion of the press. At the oattie-

eloquent upon the value of daily newspapers, and the
hola they had on the affections of the people. “ The

Sir John Robertson is getting old enough to
know better. We have borne with him a long time,
b it now that his public conduct has become positively
indecent, we consider ourselves called upon to inter-
fere. We do not oare bow he may floor with his invec-
tive, or lath with his satire a brother-member, say, who
is able to defend himself ; but when he directs his cruel
hand towards the poor aud afflicted, we deem it time to
interpose, aud protect the weak from the strong. In
his speech at the Lang Memorial meeting, Bir John,
i ot content with being generally jocular, alluded in an
encomiastic manner to a reprint from the Melbourne
Beview which had appeared in the D.T. Now, this is
too bad I It is not only cruelty, bat the refinement of
uruelty. And as such, wa set oar heel upon it. We
will not for one, stand passively by, and see our strug-
gling contemporary ndiou.ed It is time, anyway, these
indiscriminate attacks upon newspapers ceased. They
are not only in bad taste, but are uncalled tor. We
trust, therefore, that Sir John will not again be guilty
of Denaviour which we, as champions for the poor aud
lowly, cannot sufficiently deprecate.
On« day this week a playful member ot our
Assembly was cruising about me wharves when he
suddenly espied, as he fondly imagined, an exceedingly
fat friend ot nia leaning over a rail, watching a Mel-
bourne steamer discharging. It was an extremely hoc
day, and the friend, wno tnrus the scale at 18st. 111b.
was simply, but neatly, attired in a pair ot white drill
trousers, ciean shirt, and Panama hat, and as he leant
heavily forward his bifurcated integuments were
stretched to their fullest tension. Instantly the demon
ot mischief filled the piaytnl memiet’a soul, and he
said to himself “ Lo 1 I’ll nave a heap of fun." Bo he
did. Picking up a nice flat bosxd (the lid ot an orange
case) h* advanced with main id tread, took steady aim,
and then brought that boaid down with a pressure of
25U tons to the square inch on that portion of the fat
man’s anatomy which is farthest from the West when-
ever he chances to gaze on the brilliant giory ot the
setting sun. Then the playful member began to un-
button his shirt tor a big laugh, but as the man m white
roared “On, H ," anu jumped suddenly round, the
joker discovered he had made a slight mistake, and
uad struck an entire stranger. Two seconds later the
skittish politician’s head was jammed into a roll of
hides, whilst the soles of his ieet painted heavenwards,

A certain colonial Postmaster- General is a man
who, though he has sucoesstuily lived to a mature age,
has never yet been oelesrateu fur anything in particular.
It has lately been discovered, however, that ha is re-
markable in one way. He is very dignified. The posi-
tion of Postmaster-General is an exalted one; *• and
don't you forget it." W*il, one day he arrived nastily
at the portals of the stamp palace—his proime brain full
of a scheme for carrying live slock and furniture through
the post ut 6i. tne i t.u. As the foaming bleed stopped,
he noticed tuat the chariot wasn’t opposite the centre
door, not by nearly three yards, aj he said, “drive
on," aud leanea back to await the completion of his
journey. But the place was occupied by a cab, which
declined to shift. Then ho called a blue-coated cherub
and told him to shift the cab. But the constable, being a
Mulqumish sort of character, also declined. He
onset ved that ne knew his duty, and that wusu t it. At
this shameful uisruspeot to his exalted position, the
Miuistah bounced out of the cab, and vowed lo at once
call a special cabinet. But he uid’nt; ha went up
stairs and called for Jore;. That gifted officer maue
a recommendation. The cocky constable was sum-
moned into the awful presence, and bis head immedi-
ately cut off with a paper-knife. Then the Greek
messenger sopped up tne bioou, and the Postmaster -
General went oa with his plan for sending cow- and
card-tables through the post at 6d. tne i ton, or frac-
tion thereof.
One of the most thrilling and elaborate pieces
of descriptive writing it has been our lot to petu»o for
some time, adorned the columns of me Herald on
Tuesday last, it is an account by " A Passengei," ot
the collision between the “ Peshawar" and the *’ Glen-
roy." Of course we don’t know who the passenger is;
however, our suspicions point to Ivo Biign, and we are
quite sure it is not Heumker Heaton. We learn that
*• Mr. Buchanan, whose title was third officer," first
saw the Gleuroy, wmeu had, he says, " no lights," aud
orders were given by “ lha Captain, who, seeing tne
danger or his steamer continuing her course, he gave
orders to stop the engine, aud a second order to go full
speed astern, in order to permit tue sailing-ship to pass.
Unfortunately at'that moment the master ot the ship
also changed (sic), m place of following the regulations
to keep away or port." The distinction here between
the “ captain" ot tne steamer ana the •* Master" of the
barque, is evidently the ettoit of a great mind. Wo
don’t know which to admire most. ••Our first duty,"
says this great creature, ‘ was to nud out ic cur steamer
was sinking." He performs his first duty, and is evi-
dently set at rest as, " the machinery gave a ftw revolu-
tions which further convinced us that all was well."
Tne injuries to the ■* Glenroy" must have been of a
phenomenal nature, lor me writer tolls us she *’ was
making water through her foremast (1) watertight bulk■
head; she being an old iron ship of 25 yearo’ standing,
and her tonnage 1132 tons." (.1 I 1] VV e don’t want to

LXVIII.
O I not one rapture that the world can render
Is like to this transoendently sublime —
An instant burst of pyrotechnic splendour
That dims the suns of all the attertime;
An hour of happiness supremely tender
bet bright amid a weary pantomime.
Of prayers, and hopes, and toils, and groans,and curses
And empty merriment and emptier purses.
LXIX.
Long stood she there, hia arm her waist enfolding.
And saw far oil the amber-lighted West
Bank down his fires and turn to gray the golder.
Until the cloud-wrought mansions of tue Blest
Grew indistinct and faced wholly, rolled in
Deep-curtained slumber, on the night’s wide breast,
Until the new-Jit stars grew slowly stronger—
Aad then she stood there yet a little longer.
LXI.
She was with him amid Elysian bowers,
High in a land where never sorrow came;
She saw bright cities of fair domes and towers.
Where, ever blushing in a rose red flame,
Sweet maidens wandered crowned with deathless
flowers.
And gold-haired love-gods flitted, just the same
As the stationer supplies (they vary
In price), to send your girl in February.
LXXI.
And the calm moon came slowly up and found them
Still standing there together hand in band.
New in the marvel of the spell that bound them,
Still with a silence each might understand.
And deep and holy seemed the night around them.
And whispering breezes kissed their brows, and
fanned
Their hot young faces, and in solemn noises
Came through the woods the dreamy night-birds'
voices.
LXXII,
Her lover I have shown was not romantic;
He hardly knew the various parts of speech ;
He had no reach of eloquet.ee pedantic
(But bad in pugilism a plaguey ** reach"
Which had decided many a combat frantic).
He only felt her cheek was like a peach.
And every time she let him " close " and hug her, he
Thought “ This is Paradise, not Jinggnmyooggatee."
IXXIII,
To him the world was cleared of every trouble.
And life a perfume-laden tropic balm.
He felt as one might feel who wins the doable.
Or, after months of weather deadly calm.
With white-hot skies above, aad scorching stubble
Below, sees water rushiug to his dam.
And feels that yet he may escape the poorhouso.
And offers up a prayer for Bishop Moothouse.
LXXIV.
Then, after infinite reiteration
In secret tones, ot changeless constancy
To which no death coolct bring a termination.
He kissed her lips a million times, and sne.
To show her most decided condemnation
Of snch proceedings, kissed him back, till he
In his excitement, bolted down a quid ne
Had in his mouth, which made turn sick and giddy.
LXXV.
God knows how long they would have gone on grieving
That they most part, had not a sudden pain.
The sweet precursor of stomachic “heaving"
Beminded Hairy that this grlet was vain.
And that, although hs really mast be leaving
Within a week, at meat, they’d meet again
And with this hope expressed, th* lovers parted
Sne, radiant and aglow; he, heavy-hearted.
LXXYI
She to her home which now was high and splendid,
A kingly mansion, not a coarse abode,
And to her couch, where many sprites attended
Upon her sleep and fairest dreams bestowed;
He in the meantime a dull journey wended
along a dusty, stump-abounding road.
Which anything at all out a short cut was
Up to tha paddock where the shearers’ hut was.
LXXVIl.
But he was sick and fast becoming sicker,
And as he knew that whisky was the chief.
And monarch of the godlike hosts ot Liquor,
The sovereign cure of every pain and grief.
He strove to make his reeling limbs move quicker
The sooner to obtain this bleat relief;
And by-and-by he reached a township scanty—
A pub., a store, two churches, and a shanty.
LXXVIII.
A blacksmith’s shop—the season was October—
Was black and silent with its fire long out,
At ploughing-time this blacksmith would bn sober
And wouldn’t touch, he said " a drop o’ nowt.
Not if you prised him open with a crowbar."
Aud then would start a most ferocious bout
Which he continued on a scale ascending
Till once again the ploughshares wanted mending.
LXXIS.
“The Farmer's Arms," they called the one hotel there;
A decent inn it was, bat somewhat rough.
They very seldom had to house a swell there.
And for the " cookies" it was near enough.
Two merits it possessed—they used to sell there
The very best and fieriest of stuff ;
And ’twas so near th* chapel that the Germans
Could swig their beer, and hear tha Boman sermons.
LXXX.
Attached there was a long room, weatherboarded.
Which was called grandly the Assembly Hall,
And, although meagre in its space, afforded
Tha village many a happy rustic ball —
A battlefield of triumphs unrecorded
Where often stoutest veterans did fall
Before the wiles of the two hostess-charmers
Who played the devil with th* rising farmers.
LXXXI.
My pretty maids, the time has come to bring you
Upon the stage, so make your daintiest bow ;
’Tis sad there is no worthier bard to sing you
Than I, who have a low unlaurelled brow
And towu-oropped hair, whioh isn’t quite the thing
you
Would look for in a poet. Anyhow,
Though you will blush and say the thing a shame is,
I'm going to lead you out and make you famous.
LXXXII.
This damsel, reader, with the low-necked shoes on.
Is Miss Selina Laoy, about whom
You’ve heard before, although my head I’d lose on
The fatal block before I’d say her bloom
Was too decided ; and the other’s Susan
Whose smile would light a Baptist to his doom.
And whose unspeakable back-action ogle
Would nearly galvanise Sir Julius Vogel.
LXXXII.
Now, dears, I hand you down again, and kiss you
Paternally upon the brow and cheek,
I know yon know how much we all shall miss you.
Bat I must close the curtain for a week,
I pledge " my honour" that in next week’s issue
I’ll let you come before the lights and speak.
So smile a week’s ta-ta, you aron-deoeivers
To ninety thousand Bulletin believers.
(To be continued.)
THE NEWSLETTER.
A terribly sad death was that of Ada Koford,
in North Queensland, a lew days ago. Sne was a wife
of but five short months, and while waiting for her
husband to come home to dinner, she went lor a bathe
in the Black River close by. She had frequently bathed
there before, and it was not nniil she had been away
some time that her husband wondered why she stopped
so long. He called, and on receiving no answer, went
towards the river loudly reiterating her Christian name.
No response greeted his expectant ears, but on the
bank lay his wife’s clothes, and a further search dis-
closed her lifeless body in the water. No one was at
hand to render him assistance, and he was compelled to
perform the heart-rending task of carrying the barely
cold body to the place which, but a lew minutes before,
was made “ home" to him by her living presence. A
bruise «*n the forehead showed where sue had struck
a snag when plunging in.
A certain Professor of medico-galvanic arts
recently mesmerised a man in Brentwood so success-
fully that it was only with the utmost difficulty that he
was brought to. A few friends, however, having put
his elbow out and dislocated several of his fingers he
began to show a faint semblance of belonging still to
this sinful sphere. The indignation of the populace,
at the narrow squeak of their fellow-tawnsman it seems,
took the form or boom, and the mesmeriser bad such a
poor time of it, that he at once commenced to pack up
his gin-cate. During that afternoon, however, he was
the recipient of cads from several man led men of
thoughtful appearance, and, at latest dates, there was
no immediate sign of his departure.
Vanity Fair has got into trouble. It recently
published the list of names of the ladies (including, as
it was informed, a Mrs. Peter Taylor) who remained in
the Ladies’ Gallery of the House of Commons daring
the discussion of the Contagious Diseases BUI, ana
said that these ladies were, in its opinion, quite right
to hear what there was to be said on the subject, inas-
much as the question at issue was one effecting their
own personal liberty and personal treatment. Mrs.
'jajlor’s sedoitors now cuaraoteriso these remarks as
"libellous" and “a gross outrage." Vanity Fair
bow prints an artful paragraph denying that any •flea-
sive meaning was intended to attach to its remarks: —
« Our meaning was and throughout has been that the
Contagious Diseases Acts are of such a character that
their administration extends over all women whatever;
and that therefore all women have a tight to know
what is to be said for and against what we hold to be an
interference with the liberty of the sex, very serious,
very liable to the most grave abuse, and—as the ex-
perience of Foreign Countries shows—e< very question,
able beneficial effect in the direction originally aimed
at.” Very adroit,
SOCIAL SWINDLERS.
Sydney society is charming. It is generous,
and it is mixed. It is mixed because it is generous,
and it is generous because it wishes to become mixed.
Now, this mixture of which we speak is not formed
merely by the ingredient of the nouveaux riches—tor
these must always assume a part, and a prominent one.
in the society of a new country such as ours. No, the
mixture we have in mind is that due to the generous
eagerness of our society to admit into its charmed
circle anyone, however loathsome, who only has the
assurance to knock at the door. Never mind who or
what the man may be, let him only be well-dressed, well-
hatted, well-shaved, and possessed of a jaunty, impu-
dent air, and numbers of our "(beat people " will rush
after him, ask him to their houses, parade him before
their friends, and give him every opportunity of paying
honourable addresses to their daughters.
• • •
About the time of the last Rand wick meeting
there arrived in our *ity one of these charming men—
a certain Major , an habitue of the best London
society, &o. 4o. Ac.—a maa with his veins bursting with
blue blood, as were his pockets with ill-gotten gains.
The personal appearaaoe of the new Milord was by no
means prepossessing, but the blue blood and the fashion-
able clothes carried the day, and the Major was feted
and worshipped and caressed. The ” best people" were
again to the fore. An officer of " The Guards,” and the
son of an Karl (poor Earl 1) was by no means an easy
catch. Madame la Vicomtesse is a high-sounding title,
and such titles are scarce in Sydney. But the swindle
didn’t reach that stage in this instance. It was blown
upon too early, aad the dainty Major took wings to
himself, as well as other thing! belonging to other
people, opened hia bedroom window at the Club, aud
one fine morning flaw away.
• • •
Mr. C— was another gentleman of the same
stamp. This was an individual who was possess ad of a
highly Inventive genius. Young and handsome, with a
pleasing address, and with a conversation which gave
evidence of high culture and education, it was quite
natural that hs should be warmly received, especially
when it transplred-quite by chance, of course—that ha
was a scion of the house of Gonebroke. Then, his
sister, whom he brought with him, was such a beautiful,
fascinating girl. How oould she help being beautiful
and fascinating when she was reputed to have £1000 a
year of her own P Poor girl, it was not her fault that
all the men ran after her so, that crowds of admirers
haunted her footsteps, sighing like furnaces with eager
desire—for her money. Nor was it her fault that after
Mr. Blank had been protesting unceasingly for three
days that it was not her money but her beautiful self
that he was in love with, that she should promise to
bestow that beautiful self upon him, minus the money
whioh he had said he didn’t want, and which she
never had. Than, why, we wonder, did our friend feel
so mnoh Blanker than usual when he learnt the real
state of the ease ? Mr. C—— and his sol disante sister
stayed at one of osr principal hotels, aud lived on the
fat of ths land, until, as fate would have it, tha little
money they had brought with them had all vanished.
Under these distressing circumstances, there was no
help for it, but for our friend to return to his old excel.
lent practices. Luckily for us, however, C 's luck
had gone, and his next appearance was in the prisoner’s
deck to answer to a charge of forging and uttering.
Charge proved, verdict guilty, sentence five years penal
servitude, which he is at cow, his sister being where
she was before.
* • •
Weep not at his sndden and ignominious de-
parture, but console your sorrowing hearts by the
thought that C.'s most intimate friend and associate
is still amongst us. This gentleman is even more bril-
liantly endowed than was his friend; for if this had not
been the case, they would now be picking oakum
together. This man is a true gentleman, a man born to
shine in society; and, though not actually belonging to
the peerage, still of excellent family. His father is
the p issessor, so he will tell you, of one of the largest
and most aristocratic medical practices in England;
and it will be wonderful if, before you have been talking
together ten minutes, he does not find out that he
knows intimately some dear mutual friend. Lend
yourself to his blandishments, and you are lost, or,
rather, your money is—which is in all probability the
most important part of you. This maa is a scientific
money-wheedler—a thorough artist, as they say. He
does it so cleverly that it almost becomes an actual
pleasure to be robbed by him. To do an honest day’s
work would be to him an impossibility, but he can pick
a pocket, or manipulate a look, or ransack a portman-
teau with tha best. By the bye, it was a little piece c f
business with a friend’s portmanteau that was the
cause of his leaving his last head-quarters so suddenly,
and he is now “ wanted ” on this charge, as well as on
another of forgery. Bnt our friend is too clever to be
caught,and in all probability, as we write, he is in a pass-
able disguise, stretching his legs under the mahogany
of some wealthy mansion at Darling Point, or some
other equally fashionable quarter. We met him the
other day at a private house, where evidently no one
knew him; —naturally, he was laying himself out
to be very agreeable, and apparently was succeeding in
his laudable endeavours. We said nothing; it was no
business of ours.
• • •
Certainly it does not appear to be the slightest
use interfering in these matters. People will go their
own way; consequently, it is the wisest plan to let
them disenchant themselves, even if they do burn their
fingers. At the same time, it may be of some use to
give them this one warning: that, at this moment,
there is at least one of these charming individuals in
their midst. The only way in which they can free them-
selves from danger is not to embrace everyone they
meet, until they have found out something about him.
It is hardly fair to the daughters of the house—simple
girls some of them, who know nothing of the world —
to give them the chance of tailing in love with, and
possible getting married to, an ex-felon.
He was being searched at the watch-house ;
charge—drank and disorderly. “Bhargnnt," he hic-
cupped, •• want tellyer shumshing." As that officer
approached, the coBatab.e who was going through the
prisoner brought out a cake of soap. •• Ah, I know
what you were going to say," said the sergeant. “ Bob
it won't del Nothing will aonvinoe me how that you
are a reporter."
Mr. A. Jones, of Launceston, found a horse-
shoe imbedded in the centre of a willow tree. As the
tree is 18 inches thick, the iron must havo entered its
soul very many years ago. If very young wattles are
carefully tied in a knot, they will, in eight or ten
years, grow to a large size, with the knot still in them.
We have seen instances which completely puzzled
those who did not understand the modus operandi.

“Wreckage."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
‘the pathos of the Fiotarea: the weakness and the
strength—
The years it cost to paint them, in all their weary
length;
The wound, the wrath depleted—the prida that lays it
bare;
The splendour of the sorrow, unchecked, unhidden
there.
The voice of inspiration—prophetic, tender, dread.
In strains of sombre music—wild murm'riuga from the
dead.
The thunder of the vengeance that rolls In colour down.
The light of vaat forglveneea now shading o’er the frown.
The songs of softest voices, and made of the waves.
The warmth of molting faces, long hid in cherished
graves,
Aburst with petals opening—surprised to life hy light
From souls erf their creator*—the meteors cf the night,
ret witch them wander onward—the Joy receding back j
The wakened heart a burden on tbe wide Ignoele track.
Go, watch them die aweary, or " settle dews A at lasv—
lint never like the ploddev, who marches plodding past.
Those lines that should be Beauty, a deep and widening
stream,
(VTth Peace upoo its bosom, with sun and Joy oglosm—
A gliding stream of gladness, oft glancing longing back
To reach unto the summer that laughs along the track.
That widens wider onward, ealm, beautiful and free.
And roils its joyous waters into a sunlit sea—
Not lost in the wide ocean, but kissing oft the strand,
And leaving marks of gladness in ripples o’er the sand.
Those lines that should be Beauty, a eullen sunless
tide.
Disfigured by misshapen trunks that on its surface
glide—
With shapeless roots that sweep the scum from greasy
banks of slime.
And blackness to the waters already drugged with
grime.
There float the petty vices, of each broken vow a part,
With hopes long dead, and virtue—the dihris of the
heart—
Awhile it rushes forward, in foamings—striving, mad—
And now in stagnant waters it eddies just as tud :
Till it meets the stormy ocean in darkness hy the
rocks.
And strews its wrongs—a wreckage among those frown-
ing blocks.
It hisses in the tempest—it rears in viper spite,
And crests the towering billows that thunder on to
smite.
It leaps In from the ooeau, and tears the trembling mast;
It rustles in the rigging—screams ruin in the blast.
It eovers the wide ocean in threats that never cease—
Those lives that should be Beauty, these hearts but
meant tor Peace t

30 to 1 was Assyrian’s price just before the
start for the Melbourne Cup race.
Just before the start for the Melbourne Cup,
Cunnamulla was fractious, and kicked [Sweet William
on the thigh.
An Adelaide paper says that the ring laid
Assyrian’s owner £6000 to nothing to start him for the
Melbourne cnp.
The University Club forfeited the Cup match to
the Alberts. This sends the trophy another round for
the first season’s play.
Perkins was beaten with the utmost ease by
M’Donald on Saturday, on the Parramatta Biver. A
match is on the tapis between M’Donald and Trickett.
How is it that there ate so few entries for the
yacht races at the Balmain Regatta, to come off to-day F
Are not the yachtsmen and the committee “ cousins” ?
The match, John Woods and Co. v. Daily
Telegraph, for the Printers’ Challenge Cup, was con-
cluded on Saturday, and resulted in a victory for the
latter.
The Melbourne settling over the V.E.C. Races
passed off in a fairly satisfactory manner, though there
are a few complaints as to the non-appearance of
backers.
The Australians are to play two matches
against the English team—the first in Melbourne on
New Year’s Day, and the second in Sydney on 26th
January.
The Newcastle regatta, on Now Year’s Day,
promises to be a “ boom.” The prizes for the three
all-comers’ races ought to draw our crack scullers to
the Hunter.
The one hour’s race for ,£50 between F. Richards
and H. Parkinson, the former receiving a quarter of a
mile start, comes off on the 10th instant, at 4.30 p.m.,
on the Agricultural Ground.
The Hon. E. K. Cor presented P. Pigott, the
jockey who rode Narina in the Maribyrnong Plate, with
a cheque for £500. Paddy also tacked the filly, so he
had a great day.
The representative of the All-England Eleven
asked the Adelaide Cricket Association to play 11 men
instead of 15, owing to the Englishmen having no time
to practise, but the Association declined to alter the
arrangements.
The University and Albert Clubs commenced a
two-days’ match on Saturday in the Domain. The
U.C.C, made 99—Powell (not out) 69, Pope 11. The
Alberts made 78-Q. Murdoch 18, Tooher 11. The
match will be continued next Saturday.
Mr. Faithfull, one of the three gentlemen who are
to select our cricketing eleven, has been teaching them
how to shoot in Melbourne, lately. This inattention to
his selection antics will not “shoot" the cricketing
Snblic —or the candidates who may be “ snuffed out” by
is casting vote.
Messrs. Newton Brothers’ crew are to row over
for the Gardiner Cup. There will be a row over these
fizzles seme day. Metal donors will have to foster
some batter patronised snort. The firm who gives a
big money prize for 150, 300, and 440yards, handicap will
strike a good lino not yet worked.
At the meeting of the N.S.W. Football
Association, trophies for the best all-round play during
the past season were awarded to Messrs. A. Taylor, H.
Hedger, J. Back well, (good name fora footballer), and
P. Taylor. The President (Mr. Wynne) was presented
with a well-executed picture of the first twenty-two
playing members.
Wo have the best authority for saying that a
certain big Melbourne sweep was this year nothing
more or less than a shameless swindle. The man who
bosses it “drew" the second and third horses through
a confederate, and the drawing was conducted in a way
which we hope to be able to fully explain shortly—in a
style calculated to make the hair of the absent and
confiding ticket-holder stand at an angle of ninety.
The man who drew Assyrian in the big sweep
was glad when he had drawn a horse, disappointed
when he found it was Assyrian, pained when he learned
that the sporting writers unanimously pronounced the
horse out of the race, chagrined when he found he
couldn’t lay him off except at suicidal prices, and his
exultation was most aesthetically intense when he
heard of the result of the race.
The Warwick and Carlton Clubs commenced a
match for the Holdsworth-Qardyne Cnp on Saturday,
on the Association Ground. The Warwicks went first
to the wickets, and scored 133, the highest scores being
Hiddlestone 68, Bigg 14, M’Hale 13, M’Donald 10. The
Carltons opened their innings, and lost two wickets for
81, the scorers being Davis (not out) 33, Wearne 22,
Webster 13. Davis, whom we mentioned as having
joined the Warwicks, has gone back to his old love!
The match will be continued on Saturday.
Seventy-eight sportsmen competed in the Inter-
national Handicap Pigeon-shooting match at Bri ,'hton
Park, held last week, under the auspices of the Mel-
bourne Gun Club. The conditions were nine bird.-i eaob,
li oz. shot, guns 12 gauge, both barrels. Prizes ; £100
and silver cup value £50, second £40, third £20. After
a capitally contested match, Mr. H. M. Faithfull, of
Sydney, who was at 30 yards, carried off first prize;
Mr. N. Wilson, 25 yards, second; and Mr. S. Buikley,
27 yards, third.
Great amusement was caused among New Zea-
land cricketers when the discovery was made ti-at the
letter read before the N.S.W, Cricket Association pro-
posing the visit of a N.Z. team to Australia] was written
by an individual who represents an insignificant
second eleven. He doss not appear to have had
any authority whatever to forward such a communica-
tion, and the cricket association at Auckland will pro-
bably represent the matter to the N.S.W. Cricket
Association.
A sale of thoroughbred horses was held at New-
market (Vic ) on Monday. Darebin was knocked down
to Hon. E K. Cox for 1550 guineas; Stock well was pur-
chased by Mr. Bliley tor 660 guineas; and Bagot by
Mr. J. O. Inrlis for 500 guineas. Flying Jib realised
300 guineas, Mr. Pysrs ueing the purchaser. Heptakos
and Hereford Bay brought 245 guineas each. There
were others sold, and a large number passed in.
Amongst the latter wereliOthair, at 1000 guineas :
Prometheus, 800; The Assyrian, 490; Anglesey, 435 ;
Savanaka, 8 u war row, and Kanaka, 250; dir Garnet
(late The Hebrew)* 225 guineas.
About the only sensational wins on the late Cup
on record as yet are George Davall’s, a barman in a
hotel at Toraetown, who won Miller's “plum" of
£2000; a domestic servant in a Sturt-street confectionery
establishment at Ballarat who landed £1000 1 a popular
sharebroker at the “ corner" who potted £2200 on the
“ correct tip. " A Mr. C. Hoffmeyer is reported to have
netted a thou, by the “double;" and Mr. E. Noble,
Hargraves-street, won over £600. John Dowie
says all who bet will go to hell and stay there, but then
John “ wasn’t in it.”
The great 300 yards’ footrace for .£200 a side
at Charters Towers between Edward Hillyard and Elias
Ellery came off on 21st October. Both men were in
splendid condition. After a couple of false starts, they
got away well together. Hillyard immediately showed
in front and increased his lead at every stride, eventu-
ally winning easily by twenty yards in 31$ seconds, hav-
ing broken 21 seconds in the first 200 yards. Hillyard
stmds 5ft. 6in , and toed the mark at Sit. 101b. Ellery
was 5ft. 8Hn., and lOst. 101b. .Nearly £3000 changed
hands over the event. £40 was subscribed for the
beaten man, Hillyard’s trainer giving £10.
A cricket match between eleven members of
Parliament and eleven Pressmen is to take place on tho
Association Ground on Monday, the 20.h instant.
M'Elhone is not going to play; lie’s afraid that some
designing scribe would mane an effort to “ bust his
bingey." It the Pressmen can discover among their
number a bowler capable of putting in a few •* wind-
jammers," and thus relieve Mam tiers of soma of the
superfluous gas wuioh they utilise in speeches, of
course they will be satisfied with the result; while, on
the other hand, tneMembers wili be nappy to allow the
scribes to blunder as much as they liae, and will not
find fault with them for so doing.
The Melbourne correspondent of the Herald
says : “I suppose it would bo possible to make a moder-
ately correct estimate of the sum-total spent in the
vanities over this Cup race. Suppose wa put it at a
hundred thousand pounds, and then, for tho sake of
artistic contrast, set this sum side by side with the
picture of a family just discovered in Carlton in a state
of veritable starvation—the parents dying, and the
children, nearly naked, lying upon bits of old sacking."
We submit this for the sake of the children, to the sur-
prised backers and drawers of The Assyrian.
The first Victorian Derby was run in 1857, tho
winner being Mr. W. Greene’s Tricolor, ridden by Dick
Snell. The first Victorian Cup was run in 1861, and won
by Mr. De Mestre’s Archer, piloted by Johnny Cutts. I
In the following year the same game old horse and
clever jock repeated the performance, lOst. 2lb, being
up. Tho fastest Darby time is Navigator’s, 2,41$;
whilst the smartest Cup performance was done by Mr.
John Tait's The Pearl in 1871,and the same gentleman’s
The Quack the year after, the two miles being covered
by each horse in 3.29, Pearl carrying 7st. 31b.. and The
Quack 7st. 101b.
On the day after the Melbourne Cup was run
there was some fine sport at the Elsternwiok Trotting
Ground. Mr, Eobins’ Captain Dearborn appropriated
the Purse of 50 sovs. Mr. Qoyder’s Native Cat was
second, and Collins' Leithamstoad third. For the 100
Sovereigns Purse, free for all, in mile heats, Commo-
dore was declared the winner, Havilah being second
The Four-mile match for 200 sovs., between Wanderer
and Brown Hawk, was won by the latter, in llmin
26iseo. Wanderer was made the favourite. In the
first mile Brown Hawk broke badly. Ho soon after,
wards took the lead, and eventually won easily by 120
yards. Wanderer appeared to have lost his pace.
Mr. M. H. Stephen, Q.C., and Mr. Charles Oliver,
Under-Seoretary for Xi8.nd8 y liavo boon appointed
trustees of the Association Ground, in the room of Mr
8. C. Brown, deceased, and Mr. W. W. Stephen, re-
signed. Mr. Stephen has been an active member of the
Association for some time, and Mr. Oliver was, some
Sears ago, one of our most prominent cricketers. The
bird trustee is Mr. P. Sheridan, whose rigid attention
to his duties is now proverbial. The ground is a credit
to all concerned in its formation and improvement,
and the managing trustees should now be able to make
things hum, because every man is in his right place.
The Eandwick and Eugby Clubs concluded their
match for the Furness Cup on Moore Park, Eugby
winning in one innings by four runs. The scores were
Eugby, 81—M’Connell 37, Chapman 15, Turner 10
Eandwick, 41 and 36—J. Hardie 16 and (not out) 20. It
is remarkable that in the second innings of Eandwick,
the above two men scored 33 out of 36, and M'Coy, the
Eugby bowler, performed the astounding feat of taking
five wickets in six balls. The Eandwick team were four
out for 35, and all were out for 36, The Croydon and
Victoria Clubs will finish their match on Saturday, the
Osborne and Carlisle Clubs to follow. To-day (Thurs-
day) the Cleveland and Glebe Strathmore Clues com-
mence a match for the Cup on Moore Park at 10.39. Tho
Eaymond v. Surry United matob was due, but arrange,
meats could not be completed for a commencement on
the 9th.
“ What will he do with it ? ” That’s the burn-
ing question now. At tho recent Eifle Association
matches here, Lance-Sergeant Campbell, of the “Bath-
urst Burrs," won the prize given in the Merchants’
match, Mr. Campbell is not only a man of rank
amongst our brave defenders, but he also holds one of
the highest offices in the leading lodge of Good
Templars in the Western districts. His horror and
surprise, therefore, might have been imagined from the
expression of his eyes when he found his trophy con-
sisted of a case of claret worth £2 5s. Last year he
won a pipe; but, as he never touches the weed, the only
way he could make _ it useful was by blowing soap
bubbles out of it during his leisure hours. Next year
he will probably win a baby’s rattle, or a box of
hairpins.
Ensh xa willing to row Laycock for .£500 a side,
on the Clarence. We do not think Elias will accept
the challenge unless the venue be changed to the
Parramatta Kiver. It is not a month ago since Kush
retired altogether from rowing. He is satistted with
his performances, but, evidently, the taunts that Lay-
cock has received have also probed Eush, who is not
willing to lose all the credit of winning the Punch
trophy. The match is inevitable. There are tome
people who are beginning to think that Layoock is
travelling: on the downward road with Trickett, and'
turning: their attention to Rash, they discover that
is a batter man than they thought. A match between
these two champions will not be looked upon as such
a foregone conclusion as it would have been a year ago.
A meeting on the Parramatta or Clarence! both men fit
and well, is a “consummation most devoutly to be
wished.*’ Bowing has been so “ in-and-out," lately,
that no dependable line can be drawn from style, size,
or time-trials. Performances form the beat criterion,
and Bush has the bulge on Elias, there I
The attendance on the third day of the Fleming:-
ton meeting was fair, and the racing excellent. 13
started for the Hurdle Bace. Loth air, with list 121b up,
won easily; Discount and Basilisk running a great race
far second place, the former gaining it by half a length.
Darebln won very easily the Royal Park Stakes, Lord
Burghley was second, Liberator third. Sting was last,
dhe Oaks Stakes fell to Vauoluse, who beat the
favourite, Solitude, by a short length. A great race
took place for the Flying Stakes, resulting in favour of
the great colt Kingsdale, St. Lawrence second,
and Larpent third. 21 started for the Spring Handicap,
1} mile, which was cleverly won by a neck by Standard
Bearer, in the remarkably quick time of 2min lOseo,
Lesbia was a good second. The Gem third. The
Veteran Stakes, H mile, brought out a good field. The
Assyrian justified his Cup victory by the grand race he
ran with Commotion, who, however, wore him down in
the straight and won by three lengths. First Water
was a good third.
An immense crowd attended Flemington on the
last day of the meeting, when the fine weather afforded
the ladies the opportunity to give their Cup dresses the
anung which alone gratifleth the female heart. 26 started
the Flemington Stakes, which was won easily by
Middlemaroh, in very fast time. Segenhoe was made a
warm favourite for the Produce-Stakes, but he was
badly ridden, and the race was cleverly won by Calma.
Segenhoe cimo very fast at the finish, and made a dead
heat with Boolka for second place. Creswick, who had
been made a big favourite for the V.R C. Handicap, wae
scratched on the course. Gudarz forced the pace all
the way, and Gipsy Cooper challenging at tho half-
distanoe.the pair settled down to a brilliant finish, which
ended m favour of Gudarz by a head. Left Bower was
made a great favourite for the Steeplechase. The race
was one of the best ever seen over fauces. Kanaka, who
made each a bad display at Bandwick* won cleverly.
Sailor being second, and Loft Bower, tiring with the
weight, third. Darebia was served up hot for the Can-
terbury Plate. He led for a mile, pulling double, when
Commotion headed him, and both horses went at it
ding-dong. Commotion wore Direbin down, and biat
him at the finish. Sweet William was third, thirty
lengths off, and The Assyrian was fifty lengths
behind Sweet William. Plunger was heavily backed for
the Free Handicap, and he justified the expectations of
his party by winning comfortably from Anglesey and
Flying Jib.
Perkins, the sculler, is too ingenuous, too un-
sophisticated, for the Australian aquatic world. Last
* nday, he published the following in the Nooze “ It
being the eve of this, my first race in the colonies, I
think it right to inform the public that, although every
attention has been given to me in training, tho peou-
lianty of the climate has had an effect on my constitu-
tion which will seriously militate, I am afraid, against
my chances of success to-morrow. That I shall do my
best, however, the public may rely on." This is a
cheerful skip from tho usual “ Can’t lose it, old man,"
■ u °w enough, cully," “ Row rings round him,
joker, of our too self-confident oarsmen ; but, Perkins,

Great Beat Race," “the patronage of the public is

Nearly every junior club now has its own
matting and no longer sentries have to post themselves
early on Saturday on Moore Park on the good (or rather
the beat of the bad) wickets on the treacherous turf
there. The clubs come up betimes, and dump down
their matting on any spot* and lo, a good wicket is
formed. As far as tho preservation from knocks and
bumps of the tender frames of our junior cricketers*
is concerned, the innovation is good, but from
a season’s experience of it, we have die-
covered fatal ©ejections, and in the interests of
our coming champions, and fearful of tho de-
terioration of cricket in N.S.W., we hasten to pro-
claim them. Firstly, the bowler gains and suffers. Ha
gains by tho fact that the ball comes fast and low from
the pitch, thereby causing a short-pitohed hall to be
hard to play, and a lengther almost unplayable. This
puts fast bowlers at a premium, but the slow, dodgy,
bawler s occupation is gone. Neither break nor spin
can be made effectively on the matting, and this best
average style of bowling is sure to die out with the
juniors. The batsmen save their bodies to some extent,
but are impeded by the pitch, the sight, and the
running. We should advise our junior clubs to play
on the matting as little as possible. Certainly, good
wickets are not plentiful, but in the true sense of the
term a mat wicket is anything but good. The junior*,
however, will learn the advantages of the turf, and we
hope to soon see good wickets arise, Phconix-like. from
the ashes of the mats.
The Double Bay Regatta waa an unqualified
success, and, to quota a stock phrase of the dailies,
reflects credit on these concerned in the arrange-
merits." The Commodore was engaged as flagship
and a large number filled the Agenoria, which did
duty as umpire’s boat to follow the races. The race for
8-ton yachts was won by the Sirocco from scratch, who
made her points before the wind. The double-scull
race was won easily by G. and W. Rawlinson, in the
Eliza. Grand Flaneur won the race for canvas sailing
boats not exceeding 15 feet, Maggie being second. The
race for junior double sculls in skiffs resulted in a win
for SEE. No. 1—E. Bedford and J. A. Brodie (stroke)
No. 2 8.E C. fouled with Glebe several times. The
Ethel won tho race for half-decked boats, 20 feet and
upwards. Buttercup being second, and Cory phene third.
Tbe_ handicap race for all-comers was won by the
coming man, Q. Davis, with a handicap of 42ft The
Lottie took the race for 20 feet boats. No Name being
second, and Luoia third. Tho race for Wolverene and
Vernon boys was a row over for the Wolverene, the
Vernon boys not coming up to time. Subsequently
“■hoy arrived, and the committee made up a prize
which the Vernon boys won, the Wolverene crew
making a mistake in the course. The Glebe
crew won the race for maiden fours
in strmg-test gigs. The North Shore K.C. boat was
not at home in the lumpy water. She filled during the
race, and the crew were rescued by the Agenoria. The
race for the 16ft. dingies fell to the Ouida, Violet being
second, and Nereid third. Victor was leading on the
rnn to Clarke Island, but it unfortunately capsized,
ine maiden pair oars for amateur residents of Podding-
ton and Woollahra was a fizzle. Only two crews
started, and before twenty lengths had been made.
Morhmore, in the Dreadnought, broke his oar. John
Macintosh and H. Ellis, in the Fred. Marshall, rowed
over the rest of the course. There is little doubt the lat-
ter would have won had no accident occurred, as evi-
dently they had the best boat, and, in the few lengths
they were contested, they had already established a
decided lead. C. C. Medcalf and J. Arthur pulled off
the double scull race for seniors in olub skiffs. The
Arrow, E. A. and C. W. Gaden, was second: and
Patience, F. J. Bull and C. H. Williams, third. The
tub race was won by W. Stannard, junr. A tub race for
all comers was won by O. Monland. His opponent was
upset, bat he swam the coarse.
SPORTING GLEANINGS.
M Indoe, the champion swimmer, was presented
last week witn a beautifully illuminated address by a
number of his admirers At a meeting at to in-
augurate a day’s races on the 9th, the chairman re-
ceived the motions for the election ef stewards and
committee, and without calling for a show of hands,
pronounced them carried. A gentleman, not present,
was proposed and seconded as judge, when a local beak
got on his legs and jerked out, “ Gentlemen, I beg to
propose an amendment to that ’ere resolution. I beg
to move that I be appointed judge, I will also give a
guinea towards the sports." The amendment was
seconded, and the chairman pronounced it carried.
The town can boast of two racecourses. The newly,
appointed judge and party wanted one course, while i
the opposite side advocated the other. Judge and
party were finally defeated. Then,he rose and said,
“ Gentlemen, I withdraw my guinea.” Jim Alison’s

THE FAIR FISHER.
A pretty girl sat in a boat

A fishing with a bit of string
Tied to a nail.
And all the chaps, you bet your boots.
Looked hardly at her,
A gliding by in sailing-boats
To the regatta.
She stayed there fishing with a nail

But not a single sailing-boat
Came sailing back.

The display ot dresses at Fiemington on Cup
Day fell short of expectation. Rain came down ana
ruijfcd thousands of pounds’ worth of costly costumes.
Bat apart (rom thit, the display was not like it used to
be years ago, before the fair sex were elbowed out by
the thousands of men who now throng the enclosure.
Mrs. Joseph Clark’s dress was thought|by some to be
tho grandest on the lawn; it was ot Qloire de Dijon
gros-grained silk. Warded with oriental silk, and
shaded. One of the test dressers in Melbourne, Mrs.
Malleson, wore a cestlv toilet of golden bro*n silk,
relieved by palo pink silk, white bonnet. The wife of a
Sydney solicitor (Mrs. J. A B. Cahill), wore a trained
heliotrope satin da Lyon and Spanish lace. Mrs. M.
Goldstein wore fawn tatin de Lyon and broche; small
JUr.ngtry bonnet with ivory jet and damask roses Mrs.
Geo Gordon appeared in French grey, w,th coral pink
trimmings, bonnet and sunshade to match; Mrs. George
ffiignold wore black satin, with blush rose brocade
stripes, bonnet and sunshade to mateh; and Mrs.
Garner wore grenat satin. Mrs. James Purveys
■ooetume was a sapphire blue satin, straw bonnet trim-
med with same and floelle lace. Cream was a very
favourite color ; so was peacock blue. India muslins
and delicate cashmeres were plentifully displayed till
the rain cane on, and then their airy beauty faded out,
and left them limp and clinging; and “ lovely woman,"
who expected a regular field day, was crashed again I
Rainbow-hued paratols were in great abundance. Many
ladies wore light silk dust-coats over their dressy
costumes for protection on the road. Bustles and
crinolettes in some instances were very prominent, and
even when not so, those who adopted the houffante style
in moderation looked decidedly more stylish chan those
who set themselves resolutely against it. Some pom-
padour sateens were conspicuous, notably one ot the
porcelain blue, covered with siz-inoh dahlias. When
the rain came, the stand was of course rushed, and the
crush was so great that numbers of ladies tainted, and
then could not be laid in a reclining position, but had
to be carried, or held, in the dense crowd upright, till
they recovered. Those who could not by any possi-
bility got any shelter whatever, sto»d it oui; the
pretty parasols were soon soaked, and then tbs colors
began to run, and the magnificent costume* that were
Iliumihi cf artistic skill became saturated, pulpy
masses, as the raiu wet them through and through,
while the fair wearers’ hearts were almost breaking.
The A-Syrian coming down like a wolf on the (old was
mere nothing compared to the rain that came down on
the Fiemington lawn on the unhappy Cup day of 1882.

Last Friday, at Christ Church, North Shore,
nrt a id literature were united : the eldest daughter of
Mr. J. C. Hojte, the well-known water-ooiour
painter, became tho wife of that clever journalist, Mr.
Francis Myers, who, we may confidentially inform our
readers, is responsible for many of the good things which
now apptarin the Echo. The wedding was a quiet one,
only tho personal friends of the bride and bridegroom
hiving been invited.

On Wednesday, 1st November, a banquet was
given by a number of friends at Compagnoni s Rooms,
to Messrs. John and William Forsythe, of Regeut-
etreet, who are retiring from the business ot produce
merchants, which they have carried on for many
years in a successful and creditable manner. After a
capital dinner, Mr. H. Clarke, M P , proposed the
loyal toasts, and Mr. Mazo gave “ Our Quests ”
culogistically. Messrs. Foisythe responded; and the
toasts of “ Produce Merchants and Auctioneers,”
replied to by some half-a-doxan, “ Ladies,” “ Press,”
&c., closed proceedings at a late hour. Apologies ware
read from several gentlemen for non-attendance, i«-
eluding the Mayor, who had a prior engagement, but
several members of Parliament were present Messrs.
Forsythe are gentlemen of strong and sterling worth—
scarce in thete days.

Eiisfeldfc’s free show drew a lot of visitors to
his rooms at Withers’s Royal Arcade, on tho opening
occasion last week; some trod timidly around as if
uncertain whether they ought to be in such a fine place;
while the lordly air of possession assumed by others
made it difficult to distinguish which was tho spirited
proprietor. We found him at length, however—spotted
him by the artistic shape of his heao, and he showed ns
round. The reception room on the first floor is spacious,
carpeted, airy, and light, and in it a telephone is kept
for tho purpose of communicating with tue other estao-
liahment. Up above is the larger show room, with
numerous frames of pictures on the walls and tables.
The best picture is a tine crayon enlargement ot the
Mayor, wearing a happy smile —an aocorate repre-
sentation of his appearance an hour after the Council
passed Mr. Young’s resolution re the Davies case. Mr.
Roberts also looks well, in close propinquity to Miss
Polytechnic Spencer. The Misses Deorwyn are there,
too, in large size, with beautifully painted complexions
—on the pictures, of course There are carte and
cabinet, panel and promenade, imperial, bust, and life-
size. Mr. Riisfeldt has a camera for taking life-size
direct, which coaid be used, on emergency, as a sleeping
apartment. A specialty is large rustic groups, boating
parties, balcony bevies of maidens, and so on; but all
taken in tho gallery itself, where not only boats,
balconies, birds, and other things, but also maidens,
are kept on hand wholesale and retail. The gallery can
have the light thrown in from any direction required,
except from underneath. One large gioupof a recent
Botany bridal party is very good ; so is another repre-
senting a well-known lady and a parrot, apparently en-
gaged in a talking match. Gentlemen have retiring
rooms; also the ladies, where the final touch of grace
is put on the frizzes. The Artillery Band played mnsio
in the afternoon and evening, and the stairs and rooms
were decked with flags and terns. And in a spare room
n cosy little banquet was spread—presumably for the
D.T. people, as Herald men, no matte- how tired
and hungry always go home to their mroli— even from
the North Shore Industrial College.

Some time ago we announced the Western
Suburbs Musical bociety’s Ball. Well, it did not come
off; but that was not our fault. The fact is, the ball
was fixed for the 6ch October, but a combination of cir-
cumstances caused it to be abandoned. Tho Society,
however, loth to drop the idea altogether, held a capital
Cinderella party on Tuesday night, which, thongh less
pretentious than a ball, is quite as enjoyable, and a
good deal more sensible, in warm weather. About 80
guests were present in the Burwood School of Arts, so
i here was plenty of room ; the ladies did not miss tho
opportunity to display some pretty dresses, chiefly
light blue and pink ; and Shapter and Hermann pro-
vided their usual good musio. Refreshments were pur-
veyed in the ante-room, and eighteen dances ware
managed by midnight, when the company separated
after a hearty and healthy four hours’ whirl.
• « •
A ball was given in celebration cf Mrs. J.
Jackson’s birthday on the 20th October, at Borae Creak,
Urann, about eighty ladies and gentlemen attending;
and in spite of somewhat bad weather, it was a pleasant
snoot ss The ballroom was neatly adorned with quan-
dong «”d bores foliage, and after an excellent supper, at
which the healths of the host and hostess, Ac., were
toasted, dancing was vigorously maintained till a late
hour. Among the gaily attired ladies, Mias May
Jackson, in a rose pink and cream, and Miss Cox, of
Urana, in white silk and cashmere, appeared to great
advantage. Miss Inglis, of Waggs, in white grenadine
trimmed with cardinal satin, was graceful, as was a
-onng lady from Sydney in heliotrope and cream. Miss
Prentice wore a rich mauve and old gold satin. Miss L
Jackson cardinal and black, the Misses Higgins pale
blue, nrd Miss O’Brien pink grenadine and pink satin.
Mrs Jackron had the satisfaction of knowing that her
effort- to please guests, some of whom had come very
long distances, were appreciated by them all.

Mr. Charles J. Campbell, third son of Mr. W. B.
Campbell, and a partner in the firm of Messrs. Campbell
Brothers, was married, on T hursday, the 2nd instant, to
Miss M’Kofcerts, of Wavcrley. The ceremony was per-
formed by the Rev. Stanley Mitchell, assisted by the
Rev. Joseph Campbell (brother of the bridegroom).
Everything went well. About fifty sat down to the
breakfast, which was prepared in first style by the
Compagnoni Catering Company; after which, the usual
speeches were made, and the happy pair (Mr. and Mrs.
Campbell No. 4) took their departure amidst hearty
good wishes and much merriment, especially on tho
part of the bridesmaids, for Pioton, en route to Mel-
bourne.! ’
At Eandwiok, on Saturday, Professor West a
adult and juvenile dancing classes met in the the pretty
Town Hall, at a breaking-up party About fifty dancers
took the floor at eigbt o’clock, while more than that
number watched proceedings from the platform and
gallery at opposite ends. Two sets of French cotillons
—quite a unique dance, taught only by Alien (P) at
present—were performed by juvenile pupils in a style
that evoked admiration all ronrd. Their movements
were all that grace coaid be, and tfco little maids were
all beautifully dressed, so that their performance was a
treat as well as s novelty. Mrs. Bentley provided ex-
cellent mu-ic, and the hall had been elaborately decked
with foliage and fern fronds by well-known residents.
A final d inoc, in which visitors joined, was completed
in lime for the t arn to town.
• • •
Professor West’s Complimentary Party took
plaoe at the Town Hall on Tuesday night, and there
was a large attendance. With the exception of a very
few friends, all were pupils, and they came from all
points of the compass. At half-past 8, danomg com-
menced with a grand march, after which, counting
extras, nearly thirty dances were negotiated. On the
programme were several dances not common, such as
the Spanish Dance, Queen Quadrilles, Scotch Polka,
and French Cotillon. This last-named dance is ein-
gnlarly pretty, consisting of three figures, all executed
to slow waltz time, and the gliding, swan-like move-
ment which the dance requires, not only renders romp-
ing impossible, but makes the dance itself seem to the
spectator a delightfully easy and graceful peiformance.
Decorations had been put up by tho fair hands of lady
pupils, and light refreshments were dispensed during
the evening. All wore evening dress, excepting three
very small young gentlemen, who were in Bunthorne
suits of brown velvet, tnnio and pants, stockings to
match, lace collars and large blue silk neckties coming
down the breast—the costumes being very handsome.
None of the dresses were exceptionally splendid; a
shirred and pntfed straw satin trimmed with lace being
one of the best. One noticeable for its tastefulness was
a light pink skirt freely bunched, with flowered trim-
mings, and a loose bodice caught in at the waist by a
baud. Its pretty wearer was (rom Potts Point. A
tall, (air young lady with a winning face, oame (rom the
Glebs in ail bine, and silver wreath. From Asbfleld
came two daughters of a very large firm, in white, whh
lavender sashes and rosy faces A light bine broch
and white laoe was worn by a (air Windsor belle, and a
stylish b<ack satin was shows to advantage on the fine
figure of her elder sister. From Rendwick were—a
yoong lady in all blue cashmere with pink daisies; and
from a school there the daughter of a government
official in blue tarletan and white daisies; and a pretty
face, whose owner wore a white dress and a bountiful
wreath of ferns and flowers in her dark hair. One of
the riohejt dresses was that worn by an Ashfldd lady,
of puffed white ehirt and old gold panier, with laoe and
daisies for trimmings. In sky bine satin with ecru
satin each, and filmy white lace, was a little brnnette
A Biloeia belle wore a dress both conspicuous and
handsome; the bodice was of warm pink satin, and a
wreath of lilies of the valley was worn to match; the
bunchy skirt wan ot pink pompadour silk caught round
the knees with satin matching the bodice and trimmed
with lace. A pale bine plush and ecru satin looked
well on a matronly lady, and a married lady from
Wavcrley was graceful in white, and long scarlet bows.
A handsome trained pink satin was worn by a tall
young lady from Woollahrs, whose dancing was ex-
cellent. Amongst tho music, a pot pourri of Scotch
airs was exquisitely pretty for waltzing, and plenty of
good dancing was enjoyed by tho gmsts.
• • •
On Saturday, the Government Printing Office
picnic was held at Ciontarf. Some six or seven hun-
dred ot the employes and their friends went down in the
fori noon in two steamers, and a special party of influ-
ential were run down in a little steam yaont at midday.
A pi ogramme of sports was at once started; the travel-
ling being very severe on the sandy ground. No girls'
race was provided, as of yore. We are told the pro-
prietors of the ground objected to such an exhibition,
as they were afraid it rnignt give Ciontarf a bad name.
S. Chapman won the walking race well, in fair heel and
toe; though a phantom youtn, who was encouraged by
his friends with frequent cries of “ put it on, skinny I”
made a game race ot it. The jumping rice was very
dangerous: in fact, the hurdles were so formidable that,
it nut careful, a man would trip over them without
noticing they were there. Swings, fern-gathering,
cricket and quoits received attention ; but dancing was
carried on in the hay-shed by those who were robust
enough to enjoy such exercise on a floor about as
smooth as a coal-wharf. Luncheon at 2 o’clock, Mr.
Cullen in the chair, and the principal toasts were: the
“ G n vernBient Printer,” the “ Guests," and the
“Officers and Employ 6e.” Mr. Cullen fills a position
in tne Government Printing Offioe, and tie spoke very
highly of tha Government Printer; which, under the
circumstances, was natural. Some of the speeches were
not very well heard; those that were heard hid not
much in them. They were mostly of a highly lubrioa-
tory nature. One expeota a little adulation on such
occasions, but, on this occasion, tne speakers out-
gushed the gushiest efforts we ever heard. Mr.
Richards gave some interesting facts. Tho parliamen-
tary printing averages about £20 a year for each mem-
ber; the railways cause the lion’s share of expense*;
expenses might be somewhat reduced if Government
entered into competition against private firms, which
he did not consider it onght to do; he attributed
much ot the excellence of the work turned
out (and it is of rare excellence) to being allowed
to choose his own officers; and, finally, he
narrated what a fine straggle the department had
wiih the tram-tickets. A quiet young man re-
sponded for 11 The Ladies,” and, ot ccurse, brought in
the inevitable “man the hermit sighed, till woman
smiled’’—it would be almost as impossible t» speak
about ladies without that evergreen quotation, as it
would for the Morning Rum to spell decently.
And now as to the ladies: Flowered sateens
were almost universal among them, and were
prettily suitable for picnic purposes. Mrs. B ohards
wore a handsome dress of dark green cashmere, with
old gold laoe trimmings, and bonnet to match; and h«r
daughter was charmingly attired in stone-coloured
pompadour sateen, and a mammoth black straw hat—a
regular sun-defier —with white roses on it. The Mirses
Potter wore drab cashmere and striped silk trimmings,
fine straw bonnets to match, with delicately tinted
flowers. Three Misses D'Arietta were in light sateen
costames, and the youngest of the trio rendered a
ballad dnring tb* aiternoon concert with great taste
and feeling. A .under and skilful pianiste of Surry
Hills wore a r ..iy peach eateen polonaise, with olive
kilted nndert L.rt, and a Patience hat with red roses;
and much regret was felt that she did rot perform at
the concert. A young lady in white, wit i electric blue
streamers, was pretty; amd a North score blonde in
red plum cashmere and satin, with gilt cottons, under
a ficelle lace shawl, was prettier. A youthful matron
from Asbfleld, in a green velvet and cloth dress,
flounced, was conspicuously gay; and two rifle gram
costumes trimmed with rows of white iaoe, under small
pokes, were nice and becoming, a fair little belle from
Bedfern was charming in light green raiment, and a
velvet-lined Patience hat set off with cream roses;
while a handsome brnnette was a strong contrast in a
velvet bodice and cashmere skirt ot myrtle green, be-
fitting her complexion. The charming face and figure
of a Cumberland-street blonde, in a flowered sateen
polonaise with maroon underdress, fairly entitled their
owner to be considered the belle of the pionio, as well
as one ot the prettiest dancers. The three little fair-
Vaired daughters of a Bligh-street builder were
markedly graceful on the floor. Tho open-air concert
among the trees at four o’clock drew a large crowd, and
the singing and instrumental music were quite well
heard and enjoyed. Dissatisfaction was caused by the
five o’clock steamer starting at six, and the second
steamer load of excursionists being landed at Circular
Quay just three hours later than they expected.

The farewell ball to Mrs. Lawson, at the Ash-
field School of Arts on Friday, was attended by 130 of
her friends. She and her pretty daughters leave at the
end of this month for the land of low wages and lots of
girls All the suburbs from Sydney to Parramatta were
represented amongst those who came to wish “ good-
by ;” the music (Sauerbier and the man with the cornet)
was good; catering ditto, hall de corated, and many good
dancers. The guest of the evening was in quiet black.
The daughter of a wealthy old resident of Five Dock
locked her best in white satin trimmed with ivy leaves,
and was thought by many the belle, though others
voted for the daughter of an Asbfleld land agent. A
very stylish lady from Concord wore pink silk trimmed
with red lace, and looked very happy with a short, dark
dancer. Two daughters of a District Court Judge were
admired in the Highland echettisoho, and the daughter
of a Supreme Court dignitary followed with a Petersham
fentleman, who, by the way, soon carries off the
aughter of a Concord auctioneer Most of the visitors
left by the midnight train. The celebrity of the evening
was the hobbedehoy who lit his pipe among the ladies
in the supper room, and opinions were divided as to
whether it was bis first bail, or only his first smoke
« « •
The ladies of Gonlburn gave the Bachelors a
return ball lately, bat it was only partially good on
account of disproportion of the sexes. A local scribe
describes how one young gentleman met him at 10.39
p.m. with only one dance on nis programme, and that
was expected to fall dne ab mt 3 a.m. Would he advise
him to wait t Adonis replied that it depended on which
lady it was, ant on her being pointed out, counselled
the disconsolate yoith to ‘ wait till 6 a.m ,lf necessary,
though it were only to gat one touch of her littie gloved
hand " Prom this one might imagine Adonis was soft,
but at anyrata he has sensible ideas, for he observes,
“ Next ball we have ia Qmlbnrn 111 tike care to see
that a tew of the charming Sydney belles are invited—
n< t that "uc gitls are not as handsome, bat just to stir
them up.”

It was reported at race time that the Melbourne Club
would give a grand boll A ball wa' held at Camden
Haven on Friday, in aid of the Kendall fund Last
week a popular ball was held at Blayney in aid ef the
1 mol braes band A certain titled naval commander
i t soon expected back again to complete a little trans.
action with a Melbourne belle Castle Hill was the
scene of a variety entertainment on tbe 1st instsit.
First the band drove round the village to round tha
people up; which resulted in a select audience filling
the Oddfellows' Hall, with leading residents in Qn
front seats. The programme consisted of a faroe,
“Cherry Bounce," band music, recitations, songs,
another farce, snd a dance. One of the elocutionists is
gently stroked by tho Cumberland Quicksilver thus:
“ Mr. James has a good deal to learn; it is not custom-
ary to stand with arms crossed over the chest, and
eyes shut, when delivering a song;” and Jeames adds
that “ he forgot the air, and mixed the words," but yet
“created a very good effect." While, on singing another
song, Mr. James is softly advised to “ endeavour to
sing songs that are more select and less insinuating in
their words." The Half-holiday Association
of Parramatta held their annual excursion
last week. The steamer Swan conveyed nearly
400 to Fern Bay. Dancing to the Cumberland band
was the chief business ’....No player of dance
music in Sydney is better known than. Mrs. Bentley,
and few are as well liked as the lady who has played at
Nithsdale Academy for fifteen years—and good mnsio
all the time. All preparations have been made for tbe
complimentary ball to her on the 17th instant, which
will be one of the largest ever held in Nithsdale rooms.

A lady correspondent writes strongly about an
unenohanting vendor of sewing machines, very per-
sistent and very unpleasant in manner, who is now in-
festing the suburbs. His procedure is to bully timid
women into giving an order, on time payment, whether
they want the article or not, and making himself dis-
agreeable it he do-s not succeed in a sale.
The North, where there is a shrewd admixture
ef Scotch bleod with the warmer fluid that flows
through Celtic veins, represents the head of Ireland, as
the South does the heart. But it should be remem-
bered that in Celtic races the heart rules the head, not
the bead the heart, as with the colder-blooded nations.

Mr. Horace S. Brinsmead.
The subject of our illustration is Mr. Horace S.
Grinsmead, who, it will be remembered by many
of our readers, came to Sydney for our Exhibition
season, with a great reputation from the athletic
world, having won the first prizes in the principal
amateur boxing competitions in England, and
holding the proud title of gentleman amateur
champion of England, which he gained, weighing
only 9at. ft , being by far the lightest amateur
middle-weight champion England has ever had
“ Pendragon,” in his report of the final heat for
this competition, speaks of it as a resume of the
Sayers and Heonan fight, and reports most highly
of the skill and pluck when Mr. Brinsmead
brought his opponent (a fine young athlete stand-
ing nearly six feet, a representative of Cambridge
University) to a standstill in the third round. Mr.
Horace S. Brinsmead is a member of the firm of
John Brinsmead and Son, the renowned pianoforte
manufacturers of London, whose instruments
have gained the highest awards at the various
Internatior al Exhibitions throughout the world,
and his visit was to see that justice was done his
firm in the Southern as well as Northern Hemi-
sphere. Great opposition was shown here, and
the most severe fight ensued between the rival
Continental piano-makers and Mr. Brinsmead;
but, sticking to them with the pertinacity which
had gained him many a prize in the ring, he re-
newed the great victory for the Brinsmead pianos
of the previous year (when at Paris the head of
the firm, Mr. John Brinsmead, was created
Chevalier of the Legion of Honour for the
superiority of the pianos exhibited there),
and the Brinsmead piano was awarded the first
prize, with a special diploma from the
musical jurors, placing the Brinsmead pianos
above all others ; thus again beating close on one
hundred manufacturers, including all the leading
French and German houses, which had been hav-
ing such a great run out hero before Mr. Brins-
mead’s arrival. The next year, at Melbourne, the
Brinsmead pianos repeated their victory, gaining
the highest award for every class of piano. Mr.
Brinsmead then returned to England, but his
proofs of the superiority of the Brinsmead piano
had so turned the tide from the Continental
pianos, that it was considered necessary to found
a branch house in the Australian colonies, and
with this object in view, Mr. Horace Brinsmead
has again returned ; and, after visiting his agents
throughout Australia, Tasmania, and New Zea-
land, intends making Sydney the head Australa-
sian depot for the Brinsmead pianos, and wo wish
him every success which the undoubted high class
of the Brinsmead piano, together with the great
enterprise of his firm, entitles him. The firm,
fully alive to the requirements of the colony and
the demands of a trade so promising and so wide-
spread, have got specially, from their works at
home, twenty experts, who are located in all the
big centres of population. Twenty-eight additional
men are en route from England, so that all the Vig
cities will have experts who will be able to do
justice, none the less to the public that to the
manufacturers, in the matter of tuning, repairing,
etc. [Our portrait of Mr. Brinsmead is from a
photo, by Boyd.]
Alderman [?]. D. Young.
Mr. John Douglas Young, whose features are
pourtrayed on page , was born at Hamilton,
Lanarkshire, Scotland, in the year 1842, and,
being of an adventurous disposition, took an early
fancy for the sea. At the age of 17. he was in the
naval service of Great Britain, employed in active
operations against the Chinese. He was also
engaged in that war during 1859 and 1860, under
General Ward, of the Anglo-Chinese army, which
was • afterwards commanded by the famous
Chinese ” Gordon, and rendered such commend-
able service as to be specirlly noticed by his
superior officers. At the conclusion of these pro-
ceedings, Mr. Young quitted the Navy, and being
a youth of restless energy he wished to “ see the
world ” After voyaging to other climes, he at
last had his attention directed to Australia.
Arriving in New South Wales, about seventeen
years ago, he was for a while employed in indus-
trial and speculative pursuits in town and country
until he had time to look around and gain
“colonial experience.” Then, going into the
hotel line, his business tact soon manifested
taelf, and he is at the present time the respected
host of the “ Three Crowns,” on Church Hill.
A strong desire was manifested to induce him to
accept a public position, whereby his energies and
general aptitude for municipal affairs might prove
of use and benefit to his fellow-citizens. At length,
n answer to a pressing requisition from his friends,
Mr. Young contested Gipps Ward, and was
triumphantly returned as representative of that
constituency in the election for extra aldermen
under the new constitution of the Municipal Coun-
cil. Ho has been now three years an alderman,
and has unmistakeably made his mark on tho civic
annals of Sydney. A man of considerable fore-
sight, discernment, and firmness, ho has proved
himself one of the best men yet sent to the
Council. In the matter of the Town Hall founda-
tions, Mr. Young proved himself a staunch and
fearless representative, nor has he shown all down
the black list of exposures that have since or re-
cently been made an inclination to come to terms.
While several members of the Council have become
significantly silent, Mr. Young has shown an in-
clination to speak out, and at the present time no
man can be less spared at the Town Hall. He
will doubtless be returned unopposed at the
coming election. [Portrait by Boyd.]
The Result of Big Advertising.
One of the beat and most recent proofs of the
grand results of big advertising for a good lice of
business is furnished in the immense success
which has attended the introduction of St. Jacobs
Oil to the Australian colonies. For the last
three years this remarkable discovery has been
in extraordinary demand all over the United
States, and in Europe—its wonderful curative pro-
perties recommending it where all things else have
failed. Two years ago the inventors or proprietors,
Messrs. Voegler and Co , went extensively into
advertising, offering—as one instance of their
cash if the owner of one of the
famous American trotting horses would change
the name of the great performer to St. Jacob’s
Oil. Last year the advertising account ran up to
-£400,000, of which sum .£27,000 has come to the
colonies. Eighteen months ago, Mr. Bradbury,
one of the smartest business men south of the
line, undertook the Australian agency of St
Jacobs Oil, and has travelled this colony,
Victoria, and South Australia. At the
outset there was the usual difficulty—a
prejudice against the Oil, but when its wonderful
alleviating properties became thoroughly tested,
the demand became general. Big as were the first
shipments, the wholesale houses soon could not
supply the orders, and St. Jacobs Oil has now a
cash sale of £4000 worth per month. This is the
substantial return in eighteen months of .£2 7.000
(already) expended in advertising, uf course,
Mr. Bradbury has travelled and gone round in the
right business stjle, atjd the Oil has recommended
itself. But still, here is the result. Mr. Bradbury
after arranging for prompt despatch of all orders
from Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide left for
Tasmania and New Zealand last week. He does
not intend leaving these colonies before iheumat-
ism, gout, and all that have been completely extir-
pated from the people.
Honourable Business men.
The cable has told of the manner in which the
English trading community have recognized (ho
honourable conduct of Mr Christopher Newton.
This gentleman, whose name is associated with
one of the biggest houses in the colony, some time
ago was unable to meet his engagements. General
prosperity, however, returned to the colony, aud
Mr. Newton paid all his creditors in full. This
probity of character cannot but be productive of
much good to the commercial community of this
country, and deserves to be recorded. Another in-
stance, by the way, of similar honourable conduct
is to he found in the case of Mr. T. Fox, of Brick-
field Hill. Some years ago Mr. Fox, like very
many others at the time, was forced to compromise
with his creditors. With returning prosperity,
however, he was enabled by energetic and economic
management of his business to meet all his en-
gagements. A short time since Mr. Fox invited a
number of gentlemen to a luncheon, and those
present were surprised to receive cheques for
payment in full of tho amounts owing to them.
Some very appropriate speeches were made on tho
occasion, Mr. Fox’s coaducfc being referred to in
eulogistic terms. From the date of returning
prosperity, Mr. Fox’s business has been gradually
developing and there is hardly a place on Brick-
nild Bill where there is a more regular and satis-
factory trade. Tho business is that of general
drapers, and a very large stock is always on hand
to select from, the material being good and the
figures reasonable. A short time ago, Mr Fox
extended his premises, obtaining greater depth
and additional frontage, affording externally
better display, and internally much more accom-
modation. The upper portion of the premises is
used for storage purposes, though there is also a
large open stock for inspection. The establish-
ment, on the is divided into depart-
ments, with extensive shelves running the whole
length of the building. The stock of dress
materials silks, etc.,and of underclothing, is of the
best description. In a quiet way, Mr. Fox keeps
his place on a par with tho substantial and fashion-
able requirements of the day, going upon the un-
changeable line of giving value for money. Look-
ing at tho career of Mr. Fox as a business man, it
will be admitted that he deserves to succeed aud to
have a continuance of his present prosperity.
Extensive Manufacture of Stoves.
It will be remembered that at our great Inter-
national Exhibition the keen competition in respect
of exhibits of stoves resulted in three first prises
being awarded Mr. F. B. Robinson, of No. 486
George-street, Sydney. The exhibits included
ttovea from all the principal factories of the
world, and the display was as good as that in any
other department at the great Show. The Aus-
tralian designs were considered far and away most
adapted to colonial requirements, and the result
of that decision has been to attract the attention
of both the trade and the public to the facilities
for obtaining in the colony the best description of
stoves. The stoves and ranges manufactured to
order by Mr. Robinson combine all the latest
inventions —ensuring economy of space and fuel,
the saving of labour, and the more general dis
tribution of heat. To see these points thoroughly
illustrated, a visit of inspection must be paid to
the show-rooms and factory at the above address.
The manufacturer has laboured hard to meet the
requirements of hotels in the matter of suitable
ranges, and the “ Victoria,” now for the first time
introduced, appears to meet all requirements. It is
a marvel of compactness, with appliances for the
regulation and dissemination of heat, with new
apparatus for heating water and driving it to all
parts of the hotel, and with facilities for a dozen
different operations of the cuisine. One of these
ranges will cook for a very large hotel. Another
range worthy of special attention is the “ Golden
Fleece,” made specially for Australian require-
ments. It is of first-class manufacture, and has
all the most approved appliances and arrange-
“ 1 he Sydney ” is a stove for the house-
hold, and certainly, to use a very common
expression, “ no household should be without
it. This stove, like all the ranges, has warming
chambers on a new plan, and a capital design for
the distribution of heat, ensuring the greatest
economy in the consumption of coal. The plan of
construction is so as to allow of its being used on
all sides (not merely on one side), independently
of a chimney, and without the slightest danger of
fire. On the whole, the stoves are quite of a new
design, whether for cooking or keating purposes,
a -ui are all of elegant appearance being
richly nickel-plated and otherwise ornamented.
Mr. Robinson will be glad to give every facility
for a thorough inspection of the extensive stock
now on view at the works and show-rooms.
Boyd and Co’s. Wholesale and Retail
Photographic Warehouse.
The name of Boyd is already identified all over
the Australian colonies with the highest develop-
ment of the photographic art. Mr. Boyd’s own
productions testify to this, but his success here as
a man of art and of exteprise would have been but
partial had he not opened to the trade the same
avenues of improvement of which he has availed
himself with such marked results. Some time
ago, Mr. Boyd, seeing the need in these colonies
for a depot for the latest inventions in the photo-
graphic art, and the supply of the most improved
description of geods, opened an emporium of
photography in very extensive premises in Market-
street, Sydney. The warehouse, which has only
recently been erected, is a fine massive stone
structure of handsome design, and four spacious
floors with patent lifts operating all over the
premises. Here, per each mail and sailing vessel,
are received large supplies of all goods used in the
photographer’s art, and, as admitted, they are of a
style greatly superior to what has long been in use
in the colonies. While in business in San Francisco,
and while on a business tour in England, France]
and Germany, Mr. Boyd established relations’
with the first manufacturers in the world, notably
those of Paris and New York, &c., and his sup-
plies by each mail are in all cases new—for the
first time introduced here. The best galleries can
here get a complete outfit, from the most to the
least important item. Uf course, there are very
many things here not yet known to the trade,
particulars of which can bo obtained on writing
to the firm. A marked feature of the business is
that Mr. Boyd attends personally to all pro-
fessional inquiries, giving his constituents the
benefit of his artistic experience. The informa-
tion thus conveyed embraces particulars as to
galleries, printing, rolling, posturing &o. In
numerous cases, difficulties which seemed well
nigh insurmountable have been overcome by this
capital method of inquiry, and the relationship
between the house and the trade has been greatly
cemented thereby. Messrs. Boyd and Co. already
supply the biggest photographic men in this colony
and Victoria, and the venture has proved a big
success. The warehouse is situated at 28
Market-street. The business manager is Mr. E.
Moore, a gentleman well known in this city for his
enterprise and judgment.
Miss Lydia Hastings.
We give a portrait herewith of Miss Lydia Hast-
ings, the distinguished American elocutionist, at
present in this city. Though now in this colony for
the first time, Miss Hastings’ fame as an interpreter
in living language of the best of English authors
had preceded her, and from what has been seen
of her performances here certainly only goes to
strengthen her reputation as an accomplished
artiste _ Since her arrival, Miss Hastings has been
only fairly successful; the managerial arrange-
ments being unsatisfactory. It is, however, in
another direction that the brilliant lady’s talents
will find profitable recognition. Miss Hastings is
a woman of high literary attainments, and accom-
plised in the theory and practice of elocution.
Now, in these colonies, there is probably no branch
of study so widely neglected as that of elocution.
The good public speakers at present here
may be counted on the fingers of one hand, while
with the fair sex tho art is almost unknown. The
presence of Miss Hastings in this city is an oppor-
tunity to tho better class of schools that should
not be allowed to pass. Nor should the Education
Department be inactive. A school for the instruc-
tion cf pupil teachers in the elocutionary art—
the formation and development or building up of
the human voice—might now be established, and
an effort made to give wide encouragement to
elecutiona-y study. Whatever may eventuate,
however, in tnis direction, it is hoped that an in-
ducement will be offered Miss Hastings to prolong
her stay in these colonies. Miss Hastings was
born at U.S.A., and it was after her won-
derful success in her studies under the great
masters of elocution, Yanduhoff and Murdock,
that she adopted the profession of a public reader.
As a teacher, herself, of elocution, Miss Hastings
has been no less successful. Her appearance this
evening on behalf of a charity, at St. Patrick’s
Hall, will doubtless draw a large attendance.
Mies Hastings, we learn, also gives a public read-
Bur wood on the 13th instant.
Messrs, Hill, Clark and Co’s Wool Stores
Circular Quay.
The present wool season will find increased
facilities for business in Sydney this year. Tho
extension of the railways, as was expected, is
every year adding to the receipts of wool, and the
rapid delivery demands corresponding arrange-
ments for storage, Ac., in the metropolis. Ihe

MR. HORACE S. BRIN8MEAD.


whole wool clip of the colony and of Queensland
is now pushed through in four months, whereas,
previously, the season extended over the whole
year. Our wool warehousemen are quite equal to
the demand, and extra means are now at com-
mand for the storage and sale, or shipment direct
to London, of all wool and produce. The bowsprits
of the biggest steamers afloat project over Fitt-
street in the heart of Sydney, and the fastest
clippers load alongside the largest of our
wools stores. And our warehouses have been
increased in number or enlarged in size to meet
the greatest pressure. The wool stores of Messrs.
Hill, Clark and Co. are among the foremost in readi-
ness for the new season. The stores are situated
on the Circular Quay, within a few yards of the
London ships and steamers. They are 60 yards j
long and 20 yards wide, each of three floors, form-
ing extensive flats, all of which are lighted by sky- j
IrT’ win^0W3 an( I endlights. Columns suppor ing
™ “£ or ® atl( i the walls are kept white, to heighten
the effect of the brilliant flood of light, and ensure
as good a display of the wool as possible. Power-
ful winding gear, driven by gas engines, operates
on all the floors, greatly facilitating the receipt
and output of produce. The lower portions of
the stores are devoted to the tallow and hide
business, and sales are held weekly. The opening
wool sale of the season was held by Messrs. Hill,
ivi nSvP?" their warehouse,Circular Quay, on
tne Uth October, with the most satisfactory re-
snlts, the attendance being largo and the bidding
spirited. The feature of the sale was the preseiee
or new men, and of representatives of foreign
houses. It is now considered certain that the
great increase in the amount of wool sent on for
sale to Sydney, will eventuate in a yet greater in-
crease of buyers than has even already been
”oted. The foreign commissioners appear every
flay to see the greater advantage of buying on the
Bpot. The result, of course, must be a bigger
trade for Sydney, and an improved market.
Great Sale of Land on the Suburban
Bailway.
This great feature of to-day, Thursday, 9fch Novem-
ber. promises to be the big land sale at Sherwood
Heights, Guildford, immediately adjacent to
Granville and Parramatta. The land is about
the most elevated in the district, and unequalled
for cultivation, the orchards and orangeries in the
immediate neighbourhood being the finest for
many miles aronnd. For residential purposes the
locality is most suitable, and affords, at a con-
venient and easy distance from the metropolis, a
complete change of air. The whole of the splen-
did estate is to be placed at auction, as many
as G66 allotments, divided by 66-feet streets being
ready to pass under the hammer. One of the
great features of the locality is that the great
fresh-water canal intended for the metropolitan
supply passes right through the property—this
canal being already in progress. 1 he terms have
been so arranged as to allow persons of ordinary
means or prospects to get several I locks—say up
to an acre or so—for a confoi table horn®, with
orchard and garden, etc. The terms are 10s. per
lot deposit, and the balance 10s. per lot per
month, the buyer of five lots to have deeds free,
ana of ten lots 5 per cent, discount. These are
extraordinary terms, and tell something of the
business shrewdness of the auctioneers, Messrs.
Watkin and Watkin. Free tickets will be granted
on personal application to the auctioneers, so a
grand excursion may be counted upon.
Mr. Evan Jones’s Jewellery Establish-
ments.
Vert few of our higher branches of art exhibit
such marked development as the jewellers' art.
It is generally admitted that the more genuine
productions of the goldsmith and the silversmith
that have been seen in this colony—the articles
exhibiting the best points of design, the rarest
exeentioa, and the most intrinsic value —have been
almost invariably the work of colonial artists.
Many hundred articles for presentation, and sport-
ing trophies, have been produced hero iu a style
quite unsurpassed in any part of the world.
One of the reasons doubtless, is, that gold—m two
senses—is plentitul; and another is that the art
finds in the _ Australian a devoted student, who is
not only quick to imitate, but apt to invent and
design. Of course, we have here some of the
best of English experts, and it is rather remark-
able that they have found, in colonial establish-
ments, far and away more scope for their powers
m design and execution. These facts were
impressively brought before the public mind at
our recent great Intercolonial Exhibition.
Wherever the colonial productions were in com-
petition with the imported the former invatiably
won both attention and p-aise for elaborateness
or richness of design, artistic finish and value. This
was more strikingly manifest in the remarkable
collection from the establishments of Mr. Evan
Jones. The general design was thoroughly Aus-
tralian, and on that account was yet more attrac-
tive. i he exhibits included cups, salvers, centre-
and cricket, turf, and aquatic trophies.
rhe_ highest praise came from the English and
foreign visitors ; and as a result, Mr. Jones’s
establishments were visited by great numbers
during the Exhibition peiiod. Mr. Jones, who is
an |Australian, and has studied the art in his
native city, stands high on the scroll of fame in
respect of trophies. His last noticeable produc-
tion was the Krug Champagne Trophy—a royal
work of art in every respect. Apart from the
position he has won with the public, his list of
successes in the severest competitions include nine
first and seven special prizes. For the last seven
years Mr. Jones has had two establishments in
Hunter-street in full operation ; and now he has
taken those extensive premises at the George-
street entrance to the Boyal Sydney Arcade, just
constructed by Messrs. Withers Brothers. Our
artist furnishes us with a sketch of these pre-
■ m.aes. They are admirably suited to the business.
j ihe lower portion is the sale department, the
j second floor the show room, and the third floor
the workshops, Mr, Jones has been a large im-
porter of the better description of English and
foreign goods, but at the same time has carried on
a very large manufacturing trade. As many’as
twenty experts have been employed, and with the
new business this number will be increased. The
Arcade establishment will be opened with a
splendid new stock, very many novelties, and a
fresh assortment of cups and ether trophies. An
inspection of the various workshops is very in-
teresting, one of the Hunter-street establishments
is solely devoted to the manufacturing; on the
basement fioor ten or fifteen hands are engaged,
English, French, German, and Colonial, and the
work embraces makiu# and repairing; at the
present time a very fine piece of work is in hand
in the shape of an exact reproduction in silver of
the ship Samuel Plimsoll, for presentation to the
great benefactor of that name to the Seaman’s
Union, a Marino Benefit Sociey; there is also in
hand a splendid silver cup for the Wentworth
Park Cricket Club. The Glebe Bowing Club tro-
phies, presented by Mr. T. Punch, are also shown
firnished ready for presentation. The other de-
partments, where work is carried on by several
hands, are the cutting, stamping, and plating,
watchmaking and repairing rooms. Show medals

are in course of manufacture for all the principal
Agricultural Societies in the colony—from Albnry
up to Charters Towers. Amon? tho principal
works executed on the premises from time to time,
are the £500 gold crown for the King of Tonga’
and the splendid gold salver for presentation to
Cardinal Newman. The opening of the Arcade
establishment will give employment to about 25
extra some of whom are coming
specially from London. The fittings of this third
establishment will cost but a little short of
£1000, and are well worth inspecting. No
less as a citizen than as a business man has Mr.
Jones been to the front during tho last ten years,
and, doubtless, his career in the future will be
watched with peculiar interest.
Improvements at Tamworth
We give herewith a sketch of the new stores and
auction matt just recently erected by Messrs.
Doyle and Gordon, stock and station agents,
Tamworth. It has been lately noticed that what
Maitland has long been as a centra cf trade on
the Hnnter, Tamworth is fast becoming for the
Liverpool Plains and Northern districts generally.
These two big centres are quite independent of
the metropolis, and form convenient and profit-
able markets for the local produce. Tamworth
township has all the elements of seli-supportirg
activity, and its surroundings form perhaps the
wealthiest pastoral and agricultural country in
the colony. The recent improvements effected at
Tamworth point to full preparation on the part of
the business men there. Our sketch of Messrs.
Doyle and Gordon’s store and auction mart indi-
cates that the staple products of the district are
to be more attended to than heretofore. These
premises are equal to anything in the colony for
trade, and are built on an elaborate scale, giving
room, light, and every convenience for display and
accommodation. The whole produce trade of the
district will here find a ready market ; and as
sales of stock, &c., are regularly conducted each
week, this new venture might be the means of
a large additional amount of money in
circulation. Mr. Doyle, who has largely gone
into the business from motives of public spirit,
has had large experience in the pastoral and agri-
cultural line, and the business finds a capable and
energetic manager in Mr. Gordon,
Drummoyne Park.
It is seldom that a property, offering so many
inducements to investors, and possessing so many
natural advantages, comes into the open market
for public competition; as properties sucb as
Drummoyne cannot be had at any price—for the
simple reason that they are not m existence, and
this sale will give the public an opportunity of
investing their money in an estate which is
acknowledged to be one of the most desirable
localities for suburban residences anywhere out-
side the city of Sydney. Drummoyne Park is a
property that speaks for itself. It must be the
“Belgravia” of the Western suburbs and the
West end of the city ; and Nature has so abund-
antly bestowed her gifts upon the charming
spot that we are satisfied visitors who
inspect it will fully bear out our statement.
The atmosphere here is ever pure, cool, and in-
vigorating, and the fortunate dwellers in this
suburb will always feel themselves recruited after
their day of toil and worry in the city or else-
where, and be ready and equal for the occasion
of each day’s duties. Hitherto the spread of
population has not been very extensive to the
Western Suburbs, owing to the land all being
held by a few persons; but matters in this re-
spect are now altered, and with the completion of
the splendid bridge overthe waters of Iron Cove,
a vast change must —before long—take place in
this locality. Drummoyne is unquestionably
the healthiest and most delightful spot in this
d 1 strict, and is always receiving the invigorating
•ea breezes, whilst, from its elevated position,
the most glorious views of our Harbour and sur-
rounding country are obtained. There will be
every convenience at Drummoyne. Gas will be
laid on at once; and the fresh water supply is
only a question of a little time. The main road
from Sydney to Eyde, via Balmain,
passes along Drummoyne, to which road it has
an extensive frontage, and the line of tram,
or light railway (as propored by Mr.
Terry), must be constructed on this rosd, there
being no other route. Independent of any
tram, however, Drummoyne is, at the present
moment, as accessible as Waverley, Bandwick,
or North Shore, and, as population increases, the
means of access will be increased also. To the
investor or the speculbtor no better opportunity
can offer than the sale of this estate, as the pros-
pective value of the property is undeniable; and
those who purchase at the first sale will, if they
choose, be able to resell at a satisfactory advance.
We have received from Messrs W. M. O’Eegan
and Co., of Pitt-street, Circular Quay, a firm
engaged in the wool, hide, and leather business, a
rough draft of a prospectus for a company to
establish a central hide and skin market on an
extensive scale in this orty. The proposal is to
have central public maikets oa the English plan,
—say at the Haymarket, a special building being
erected for tho purpose ; or to secure the old
E xhibition Building at Prince Alfred Park. Our
j correspondents believe that a company of £200,000
| in £5 shares—one-fi'th deposit— could easily be
j formed, provided ono-half the shares was placed
! in the English market. The big results shown by
tho leading wool warehousemen of Sydney, profits
of .£30,000 annually, are pointed to as proof that
the proposed c-mpany would pay handsome divi-
dends. The idea of our correspondents is the
runtu .1 principle, which would include the squatter
and the free selector, batchers, tann-srs, and
storekeepers, and which would save the real pro-
ducers many thousands, they believe, per year.
They consider that the present monopolies should
be toned down, and opine, in the prospectus,
that the Government should be censured for not
having long since taken steps in the matter, seeing
the important considerations involved. In Sydney
it is pointed out, there are vegetable markets
cattle markets, public markets for the sale of
merchandise, &c., but the great staple products
have been overlooked. The new company would
be called the Prince Alfred Wool and General
Pastoral Product Association, and the public, it is
considered by the proprietors, would be saved
very heavy charges in weighing, delivering, check
ing, Ac —all which are additional to commission.
In conclusion, the writer believes the time is at
hand to effect a complete and immediate change,
and is hopeful that when they place their project
before the public, it will meet with the universal
support of the country. In our next issue we
will give our opinion on the proposal. At present,
we merely confine ourselves to stating onr corres-
pondent s views.
The Latest Mechanical Ideas
The American Novelty Company, of Pitt-street,

of the inventive Americans, he has but to take a turn
lound onr American friend’s house of business, near the
Id V ctoria Theatre site. Having got mechanism up
- o driving a fast mail train across a continent, the
Vankees have got it down to relieving the hnman hands
entirely of labour, and they threaten to go on until
<ve’li huo all onr amusement done by machinery. We

hut there it is. For hal#-a-crown anyone is now a

The well-known firm of Messrs. Eiley Brothers,
whose business, with the aid of capable manage-
ment, rare industry, and honest dealing, has been
extended all over the colonies in a surprisingly
short time, is about to dissolve partnership. The
senior partner, Mr. A. J. Eiley, retires from
business, and, after a well-earned spell, will pro-
bably be heard of in another sphere. The dis-
solution of partnership brings about a result of
some benefit to the general public—a big clearance
sale, of which more in our next.
The neat and cheerful appearance of the ‘ ‘ homes
in the suburbs” of the wealthy man as well as of the
artizan, speaks but one fact, and that is the success of
the idea started by Mr. G. F. Murphy, of Regent House,
of making every householder an amateur painter. At
Regent House is obtainable all the necessary material,
made up ready for use, for painting a house, garden
seats, railings, and the material in this bandy form
is accompanied by a plainly written manna! of instruc-
tions, which the merest youth can understand. People
who take advantage of this'first-class idea, and become
their own manipulators of the brush, do their houses,
on the average, much better than if let on contract,
and save at least from £10 to £30. Besides, with the
material at hand, the appearance of the houses can
always be kept up, the brash being at all times ready
to operate on a spot needing attention. Wood-pre-
serving oil, which quickly eats its way into the hardest
timber, and preserves it from damp and from the opera-
tions of the ant, is also supplied for application to
verandah posts, joists, or foundation timber. Regent
Hones is two hundred yards from the railway station,
and is reached by every tram. The pr rprieto* is a little
man, with any amount of enterprise and go 1 T: e-e I

A GOOD IDEA—OFF TO SHEEWOOD HEIGHTS!—(See Article.


This is the way a Wagrga doctor describes the
ear-acheSometimes, iad ed, if the acute effusion in
a diseased tympanum be of long standing, it checks the
wasting portion of the lamiva of the proper tympanic
membrane, etc., and the o.'osoopioil frame is turbid.
The sensibility of the tumour is r ot greater than is that
in the membrane tympanic in its healthy state. It
appears, however, that it bacomee dim'ntshid under
the continuance of pressure csd the distension of the
liquid. The consistence is cot much considered. The
catheter can, with ease, ha passed if adherence is given
to the valsalvas experiment or the Psli’zer process. It
will then be found that the convexity becomes much
more visible, and the tnmeur opposes hut a temporary
resistance. It is certainly very rare that a morboso
process, and especially one of an inflammatory nit are,
remains limited to the mucous osteons wail of the
tympanum, without effecti g in the same degree the
internal layer of the tympanic membrane. The imbibi-
tion of the cpithelian thickne s, and sometimes the
under-connective, and the ih-ckness more externa),
acqniies the pathol gicil changes which ordinarily
accompany the accumulation referred to."
The (let us call the place Boobayil) blacks get a
living by gathering hone y and pyster-fl-bing One if
them, who associates a good deal with white men, and
attends ohnrch regularly, ano who is. in fact, far mi re
intelligent than any of the others, need to act as agent
in sending the honey for them to the s-ydney market
But he doesn’t now. A few days ago he lost tho con-
fidence of his ebony constituents ihusly:-After a
month’s hard toil six if them had gathered and pre-
pared some hundreds of pounds weight of honey for
market, and ccmmietiontd him, as nsua', to send it to
Sydney by tho first steamer, which he did. The arrival
of the return boat was acxii utly looked for, and all the
biackfellows waited upon tho agent for their money.
The honey had been sold, and net proceeds amounted
to the sum of £12 10s. : but tho agent paid his con-
stituents off with tiro shilling* apiece Of course, there
was a hit of a barney, bu the budding C.M G. was
equal to tho emergency, and talked to them “ straight,"
and they had to be satisfi- d with the explanation that
the rest of the money had “ all gone along commission.’’
It was when they adjourned to the nearest pub, and
were “blowing’’ their two-bob pieces, that tho fun
began Such expressions as " Him too muoh like
blank parson," " Him go along blarsted white fellow
too much," “ Him like bndgeree big fellow J.P.,” Ac,,
were freely indulged in. On the whole, the unfortunate
agent got it rough, and seemed to be locked upon by
the others ss a kind of black libel-juryman.
At a recent allotment sale near , an un-
fortunate man from Port Something was champagned
into believing his purchases were to the extent of two
thousand pounds, whoa really his liability extended to
some twenty-two thousand. As a si quo’, tbe poor
devil was forced to hand over one thousand pounds in
public to a company of unconscionable speculators who
graciously accepted tho solatium and rele.ied him from
bis very bad bargain.
Twenty-five persona have been found in Sydney
to support John Davies, C.M.G., in his suit with Mayor
Harris, to the extent of protesting against the city
funds being used in defence of the latte- in the big
slander case. Some of these twenty-five, had they
lived in old Abraham’s time, would doubtless have
saved—well, you know the cities we mean.

It is understood that the report of the Friendly
Societies* Commission is in type John Davies—a dis-
tinguished politician, who, wa understand, was rec ntly
created a Companion of St. Michael and St. George bv
a grateful Severe gu-is Chairman of the affair, »nd, of
conree, tried his level best to hurry up the report. But
tho Commission devoted so much time to their delibora-
tions that it was (so the story goes) only on a ghostly
rumour being set on foot that no more attendance fees
were to be forthcoming that the investigations of the
master-mir ds were brought to a termination. Anyhow
the coincidence is a striking one. Wa have
known the labours of other great men suddenly cease
for similar reasons The report, which has been drawn
up by Mr. W. E. Langley, is said to be bristling with
wit, and sparkling with epigram. By the way what is
the ruling figure now for Fiji gold.
An extraordinary charge of conspiracy has been
mads in Tasmania, by Thomas E. Headlam, against six
members of a fami'y named Fletcher. They entered
his bedroom at six o’clock in the morning, handcuffed
him, and conveyed him to Campbelltown—thfre insist-
ing that he should at once marry Emma Fletcher,
whom they accused him of seducing. As they were so
very pressing, 1 horns s didn’t like to say “no," straight
out; but beixplaiaed that he wa« not preparer for s uh
a sudden rush of jor, and promised if they would excuse
him for thtt day, h-? would cad around next morning
and marry tbe sw»et Emma is much as he liked. He
forgot to cal!; but h® sent his compliments by the con-

There was a lark at Dowie’s Melbourne
Tabernacle the other night. It is the fashion for con-
verts to get np on the platform and spout about all the
darkest incidents of their shady careers. A lady was
the latest rne to take the congregation into her confi-
dence. _ She said—" Christian friends, —I have been
exceedingly giddy. (Here 240) shoes moved uneasily.)
How many I have loved in my time I can’t say;—but
now if you were to ask me who was my friend. I should
say” (lookitg upwards at the sunlight)—But here
Dowie entered and the rest of tho oration was out short.
Fact.
This is the kind of thing that now meets our
eyes every morning as we ponder over our Herald and
chew onr chops :— "In Loving Remembrance of our
long lost and highly respected Uncle, Abel, who is
said to have been fratrioided by his unnatural brother,
Cain, during the first generation of the world. Noah’s
Ark papers, please copy,"

Even the _S M. Herald is becoming apprecia
live, and beginning to distinguish the compare! ve
values of mundane conditions. On Monday it devoted
three-q tartars of a column to the ob istening of a fire
engine at Balmain, while it any gave a qu rtec of a

Wesleyan church at Randwick Both of these events
are supposed to bo fore-armings against fire.
We can’t with safety give hia name just now,
but he is the junior member for Blankshire, and the
present is his maiden session. When he first entered
into the patriotic business, he told us he believed it was
quite possib’e to mix with politicians and still keep
himself above suspicion. He knows better now, how-
ever, and when he tar a few hours to spare he amuses
himself trying to bits the bottom out of tbe family
fryingpan without smutting his nose.
A committee who advertised for a music teacher
and irganist, received the following reply amongst
others :—“ Gentlemen, —I noticed your advertisement
for an organist and music teacher, either lady or gentle,
man. Having been both for several years, I cflsr you

This paragraph concerns poetry, children. Wo
are not poets ourselves, and we don’t care for poets
until they’re dead, because they’re always wanting to
borre w.money. But we know poetry when we see it,
though we don’t always kn w a poet, inasmuch as poets
are frequently disguised in liquor. There is a poor
little mound out by the sea that covers tho dust of a
man who could sirg, atd found that ho better have
had the gift of oyster-opening than that of song. The
knowledge of this makes us mad to think of the legion
of living drivellers who make fools of themselves, and
shame tbe=e who have to admit relationship, by laying
apes’ paws upon the sacred art of verse Why don’t
thur friends chain them in cellars ? Take this melan-
choly example of whet a being may become who is
allowed to haek his mether-tongue into jingling junks
at his own mad will. Poor old—well, Tom Banks—as

His success was absolute. But, considered in the

of a rat catcher. Edward Howley, however, is not the
