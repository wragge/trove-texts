Though it has been decided to cease pub-
lication of Historical Records of Australia,
published by the Commonwealth Parliament
and edited by Fredk. Watson, apparently one
more volume is to be issued. The ninth
volume is now published, dealing with de-
spatches to and from Governor Brisbane,
January, 1823-November, 1825. Sir Thomas
Brisbane’s administration of the colony was
probably the most momentous period in our
history. During the- four years of his
government the foundations of the modern
fabric of civil life were laid, and many
important principles received consideration.
This period saw the partial separation of
Tasmania; the formation of a deliberative
and advisory council to consider legislation;
the beginning of trial by jury; the removal
of the censorship of the press; the sale of
crown lands ; the establishment of the first
monopoly in the colony—the Australian
Agricultural Company, which subsequently
obtained a monopoly of coal-mining; while
many changes were under trial or considera-
tion, such as taxation by representation;
the separation of the two branches of the
legal profession; the reduction of licensed
houses; prohibition at Newcastle and Port
Macquarie; the f damming of the convict
stream; the open-air treatment of prisoners:
wages and piece-work for prisoners; and the
establishment of agricultural colleges.
Fredk. Watson puts many of these Changes
down to the reports of John Thomas Bigge.
But these momentous four years were but
a small part of Brisbane’s busy life. A
soldier who rose to the rank of general, a
personal friend of the Dube of Wellington,
present in 14 battles, 22 minor actions and
six sieges, and with a wide lighting experi-
ence in many parts of the alobe, Brisbane
was also a great astronomer and an impar-
tial and far-sighted administrator. It was pro-
bably his passion for astronomy that induced
Brisbane to apply for the N. S. Wales joD.
The Governor himself endowed an observa-
tory for the colony, and was the most active
worker in the congenial task of observing
the stars of this hemisphere. His work at
Parramatta received world-wide scientific
recognition. On his return to England he
became president of the Royal Society ; and
he just missed neing mane a field-marshal
before his death. But as a eovernor he
depended too much upon his subordinates;
and he allowed his far-sighted ideals to be
thwarted, opposed, or ignored by his officials.
The tnwarter-in-chief was Frederick Goul-
burn, the Colonial Secretary, who withheld
correspondence from the Governor, modified
his instructions, and issued orders on his
own responsibility. Though Brisbane was
aware of ail this, he made no strong effort
to counteract Goulburn’s influence; and ulti-
mately the disputes between them led to
their joint recall from the colony. Brisbane
was clad to go, leaving behind him a record
which ‘“just missed being ideal from his
failure to enforce the loyalty and obedience
of his principal executive officers.”
Incidentally, a daughter and a son born in
the colony were christened respectively
Australia and Australius.

By the death of Geoffrey Wall, of the
Royal Flying Corps, in his 21st year, Aus-
tralian literature suffered a severe loss. It
is true that it is promise, not performance,
that justifies this assertion ; but the promise
was extraordinarily fine. The English boy
came to Australia when nine years old, was
educated at Wesley College, Melb., and at
Melb. University. After his first year there
he ‘went to England, entered the Flying
Corps, and obtained his wings in June, 1917.
Two months later he was killed in an aero-
plane accident. Son,gs of an Airman, with a
memoir by the headmaster of Wesley College
(Aust. Authors’ Agency, Melb.; 2s. 6d.),
indicates an interesting personality and a
considerable aptitude for literature. Of the
26 verses selected, 20 are the product of his
17th and 18th years, and the remaining six
were written during his year at the Univer-
sity. He wrote no verses after leaving Aus-
tralia. Thus these are practically schoolboy
efforts. Quotations from Geoffrey Wall’s
letters from England show more promise
than can be gleaned from his verse; this boy
had an original mind and showed a remark-
able feeling for style and quality in his
prose. Yet though most of his schoolboy
verse is negligible—as what schoolboy verse
isn't? —in “After the Boat Race” he touches
finely upon our sporting attitude to defeat
and victory which is so incomprehensible to
the Hun
The race is rowed. Along the banks
The frenzied shouting dies away.
Slowly disperse the thronging ranks,
The azure blue has won the day.
Though not.to us—past conquerors—
The Fates decreed the hard-fought race,
We cheer the blue —the better crew,
And -own defeat, but not disgrace.
But “The Secret of the Leaves” shows a
feeling for beauty that might have led to
higher things. Anyhow, it is pretty good
stuff for a boy of 18: —
The tree-tops wave against an azure sky,
The zephyrs sway the branches to and fro,
And now and then the stronger breezes blow
And stir the gloomy pine-tops with a sigh.
A trivial thing, and yet the reason why?
1 think that countless centuries ago
I lay and watched the branches waving so,
And felt the warm south breezes breathe and die
Away among the hills, or stir the grass
Upon some sunny upland by the sea
(The blue Greek sea), and watched the shadows pass
And heard the sheep-bells tinkling on the lea,
(That was some thousand years ago, alas!)
Knee-deep in the long grass of Arcady.
Compared with the books written for the
Australian selmol-girl there is a dearth ot
books for the Australian school-boy. But
Jack of St. Virgil's, by Lillian M. I’yke
(Ward, Lock), is an excellent and healthy
tale of school-life in a big Melbourne school,
the identification of which should be easy. The
keynote of the yarn is the honor, of the
school; hut there is an interesting plot
which is not confined within the walls of
the school; and there are fun and adventure
and sports enough for the Australian hoy-
reader. Clearly written and well told, this
yarn should find a large school-boy public
throughout Australia.
E. George Marks assures us, in his pre-
face to the second series of his Napoleon
and the War (Dymock, Sydney, 2s. 6d.),
that he has written for Sydney Sun no less
than 50 Napoleonic articles. Such assidu-
ity, such devotion to the memory of a dead
man, seems to this page rather saddening.
Apparently E. George Marks can’t keep
Napoleon’s head out of his story. There
are problems enough in this war without
dragging Napoleon into the cable page.
But this interpretation of modern history
from the standpoint of Napoleon, or the
interpretation of Napoleon from the stand-
point of this war, is interestingly enough
done; and this second series shows the same
:horough knowledge of the Napoleonic era
as was apparent in his first series. It is
good journalism.
Edward Pulsford, hon. member of the
Cobden Club since 1887, states in his pre-
face to Commerce and the Empire, 191Jf and
After (King, Westminster) that for more
than 30 years he has been fighting in Aus-
tralia for Freetrade, and fighting hardest of
all, perhaps, against that form of Protection
called preference. “In the first issue of
Commerce and the Empire, published in 1903,
I said in the preface, ‘A British Freetrade
Empire is a noble object for which to fight.’
I repeat this now.” That ought to satisfy
everybody. Also, Edward Pulsford associ-
ates Empire stability with a commercial
policy of world-friendliness, and to bis last
breath will continue to associate it. So bis
standpoint is clear; and if there are any
other Freetraders left in Australia at this
date this book will appeal to them.

Apparently a number of volumes of “The
Australasian Shakespeare” aye on the mar-
ket, but only one, Henry the Fifth, edited
by J. Le Gay Brereton, Librarian of Syd-
ney University, has reached us. This series,
published by Lothian, Melb., is the result
of the combined efforts of the Anzalian uni-
versities to provide sound school texts,
which will meet the requirements of the
Anzalian examination boards. Such is the
announcement made by the general editor,
Prof. R. S. Wallace, of Melbourne. The
deduction is that the scholarship of England
is unable to provide sound school texts for
Anzalian educational bodies, or that the
school texts provided aren’t sound enough for
the examiners. This page can hardly credit
either assertion: there surely are excellent
school texts in existence; and the examina-
tion boards’ requirements cannot be so
exacting as to require a whole new made-in-
Anzalia Shakespeare. Doubtless, we have
here Shakespearean scholars and authori-
ties equal in Shakespearean learning and
acumen to those over in England; maybe,
despite our distance from the special sources
of knowledge, we have Shakespearean
specialists more acute; but still the work
must be dofie here under difficulties that are
absent from scholars with easy access to the
best libraries. A new series of Shakespear-
ean texts by Anzalian professors will no
doubt be an achievement in scholarship: but
the improvement upon the existing editions
must be infinitesimally small for the effort.
This page is eager to acclaim Anzalian
worth, and applauds the patriotism that
has led these professors to bund such a noble
monument of Anzalian learning; but it
seems an unnecessary labor, when there aie
so many subjects of purely Anzalian literary
interest that are left, undone. If this group
of professors had set to work to bring out
a series of works upon our own literature,
they would be doing a needed service to the
country that pays their salaries ; they would
bring before the world the beginnings of a
new literature; they would encourage our
youth to study that literature; they would
be in an unique position for access to all
the documents, and would possess the neces-
sary authority to speak for us to the world.
At present they leave a Professor of Poetry
in Oxford (Eng.) to discover for us and for
them what is Australian poetry, and whom
are its practitioners, though that distant
professor .cannot possibly have access to all
our publications nor possess the native
knowledge of the cross-currents, the history,
and the tendencies of our nascent litera-
ture.
Are our universities doing their job for
Australian literature, the job they are paid
for? It is noteworthy that the only excel-
lent Anthology of Australian Poetry is the
work of an editor who was not educated in
a university; though Prof. Walter Murdoch,
now of W.A., is about to bring out another.
And surely a living organism like the Aus-
tralian language is more interesting to study
than a dead reputation like Shakespeare?
Anyhow, this page finds it quite, exciting to
attempt to estimate the place of living An-
zalian writers in our literature, with always
the possibility that the pinned and wrig-
gling insect will escape and do something
quite different, something that will make a
mock of all this page’s pigeon-holing. But
Shakespeare is safe, buried a thousand
volumes deep in commentaries and editions.
Possibly the professorial mind prefers to
dissect a corpse. Anyhow here are seven
new volumes to add to the pile.
Brereton announces that in his Henry the
Fifth he has made free use of the labors of
his predecessors, and is indebted particu-
larly to three earlier editions, while he has
referred constantly to standard works of
Shakespearean reference. This page would
have preferred Brereton to have made no
use of any of his predecessors, and to have
Invented an Anzalian Shakespeare of his
own. It would have been so much more
exciting.... and Brereton could have done it
deliciously. However... .the notes are
lucid and sufficient, and where the oppor-
tunity occurs he makes original suggestions.
The printing and get-up are excellently Aus-
tralian. And now we hope the exacting
examination boards will be satisfied!
This page regrets that it cannot discover
any signs of any poetry in A Child of Nature,
and (J. V., by “Austral” (Stockwell, Lon-
don). A fair sample of the contents:—
MR grand to break awa” to the country—
Away from the city’s din;
’Tis grand to breathe the nectareous air
And to hear the skylark sing
•
Letters from Boh (Melville and Mullen,
Melb.) forms an interesting and pathetic
tribute to the late Captain George Pollard
Kay, Flight Commander in the lioyal Flying
Corps. This young Australian, educated at
the Geelong Grammar School, was the only
son of G. A. Kay, of Melbourne. The boy
showed at school considerable literary and
artistic gifts, and his school record was one
of physical prowess allied with a strong
character. A popular leader and a member
of all the school athletic teams —a splendid
type of young Australia. His capacity for
work, his ability and his character, gave this
youth his captaincy and his command of a
flight squadron, which would have carried
his majority with it, before he had reached
his 21st birthday. And then, after. doing
brilliant and dangerous work as a pilot at
the Front, he “crashed” fatally as the result
of an aeroplane accident. Kay’s letters are
delightful to read; his joy in life, his zest
for flying, his love for his people, his
straightness, and his utter absence of
“swank” or self-praise make of these letters
a document worthy of his country, and an
abiding solace to the friends who mourn him.
Incidentally, Kay’s letters give a vivid picture
of the work of the Flying Corps, of the marvel-
lous aeroplanes that are now in use, and of
his exciting experiences. The general reader
will find here the real thing, admirably de-
scribed. His death came, curiously enough,
when he was not in action. He was flying
back to his aerodrome from a visit to a
fellow officer when unexpectedly his machine
was observed to get into a nose spin, out of
which he had not the air-space to get before
he “crashed.” His death was due to pure
accident, as the machine was faultless, and
had been flown immediately before by another
officer who looped the loop 12 times; and
Kay was too careful, though so brilliant a
flyer, to play the fool. The theory is that
his foot got in some way wedged amongst
the levers, and he was unable to extricate
it, as, amongst his other injuries, his ankle
was found to be fractured. Confirmation
of this theory comes from a fellow-officer
who stated that machines were being made
with a few inches more room, apparently on
I account of some difficulty which pilots ex-
perienced with their feet among the pedals.
S
The patriotism of “Patrius,” author of
Hoisting Our Flag on the Ansae Redoubt ,
and Other War Rimes and Various Verses
(Davies andCanniugton, Newcastle,N.S.W.),
is worth more than his poetry.
There is a fragile, evanescent poetry in
1 Venture in Verse, a first offering by Mar-
jory Nicholls (Whiteombe and Tombs,
M.L.). Most of the verses have appeared
in the college magazine of \ ictoria Univer-
sity, Wellington, M.L. There is nothing
noteworthy except a sense of form in the
earlier verses. Marjory Nicholls has not
much to say, hut she says it nicelj. Natu-
rally she excels in the ' sonnet form—that
neat casket for neatly-packed thoughts. Here
is a “Bed Hibiscus in a Sydney Street” :
When I look up and see your flaunting head
,\ n d the long tongue that serpent-like shoots out,
I ask, as swift thoughts throng in revellers’ rout,
What in the world so wicked is as red?
1 see a columned hall and tables spread,
A woman, white and red, with smiles that flout,
Two wine-flushed suitors and a sudden shout,
Quarrel’s quick curses, and the red wine shed—
A gleam of swords, a bright and startling stain ;
Fear's frantic flight, and silence in the hall;
Save when the night-wind strays in, flower-sweet,
And from the guttering candles white drops fall.
Hibiscus, you do breathe of passion’s pain -
Why do you glow by this grey city’s street?
And here is a simple but palely beautiful
thing:—•
A LITTLE PLACE APART.
A little garden have I made me here
Of tender, fragrant plants —none bright or gay-
And hi tiier shall 1 come in twilight-time
To dream awhile of the dear yesterday.
A little breeze comes whispering from the Past—
A magic whisper, wondrous soft and sweet;
I kneel upon the path, to closer come
To those dear blossoms growing at my feet.
A little scent of lavender, so faint;
And rosemary—and that I pluck and hold
Thinking of vou —Death came so soon to y0u....
Another breeze blows by. ’Tis strangely cold.

Tales for Lonely and Only Children,
by E. J. Donnelly (Diddams, Brisbane),
does not live up to its delightful title. The
stories are commonplace.
On the cover of The Breed Holds Good,
the latest Bookstall shilling’s worth of
Arthur Wright, there is a jockey, a race-
horse and a Billjim in khaki knocking out a
villain, wliom we darkly suspect of being ot
German parentage. What more does an
Australian reader want?
Evidently it is to be Anzalia and ( An« a-
Han, since two other correspondents, Bart
from M.L., and “Creole,” independently
suggest tiie same substitute for the clumsy
and lanky terms Australasia and Australa-
sian.
“Simplicity” misunderstands this page s
vi wpoint of Australian slang, despite our
answer to “Spider” (24/l/’18). Where an
author is reporting, in the first person, the
speech of an individual, he must use that
bloke’s actual words; though in case ot cuss-
words and indecent expletives, some camou-
flage is usually necessary. Blanky ( or- ; )
for bloody is this paper’s compromise between
realism and decorum; though nobody ever
imagines that Australians actually say
blanky. Similarly in the war books Tommy
is supposed to say blinkin’; but he doesn t.
(in fact, he commonly uses something muen
worse than plain bloody.) Shaw and Mase-
-1; id—the former with a theatri-
cality, and the latter with an artistic sin-
cerity—print the word. W. T. Goodge added
to his reputation by not saying the word in
“Th’ Great Australian Adjective”; and
Dennis made his reputation by the same
means with his “Australaise,” first printed
on this page. But the fact that an author
uses slang or dialect in reporting the words
used by another does not imply the author s
approval or disapproval of slang or dialect.
To talk in a pained tone, as “Simplicity”
does, of introducing slang intp Australian
literature, is absurd. The slang is the cha-
racter’s slang—not the author’s. When a
slang word is introduced into literature it is
deliberately done by an author, because he
believes that the literature needs just that
slang-word, sinee no dictionary word will
exactly fill its place. And it is by the
gradual accretion of selected slang or foreign
or invented words tlj&t a language grows.
This war will add a great number of words
to our speech, and xrom that accession a
proportion will ultimately become embedded
in the Australian language. It is only the
dead languages that do not grow.
But “Simplicity” makes the further
point, by forwarding extracts from her cor-
respondence with Australian friends, that
the language of The Sentimental Bloke is
not the slang actually spoken in Australia.
One Melb. correspondent thought ,the lan-
guage horrible, and added. “But as we dont
talk like that in Melbourne we concluded
that it was your Sydney lingo.” Another
correspondent wrote:— >
I agree with every word you say about Dennis and
his Sentimental Bloke language. I _ loathe it. I
strongly resent that such vile distortion of English
should be accepted as Australian. My son is an
Australian—an Australian soldier — but thank God
he does not talk like that, and—again thank God
I don’t know anybody who does.... Dennis s ar ? ( v
is no more Australian than Whitechapel is Englisn
or the Parisian apache is French.

CHLORACO TOOTH PASTE.
Chloraco Tooth Paste is distinguished for
its complete efficiency as a dentifrice, being a
Chlorate compound.
Chlorates, it has been stated in the Pharma-
ceutical Codex, give up oxygen to the tissues,
and it is largely on this account that they
have received wide employment in foul condi-
tions of the mouth and pharynx. Chlorates
are used as a wash for the mouth when the
gums are inflamed and spongy.
The name Chloraco has been adopted as a
specific title and trade-mark to prevent un-
scrupulous persons deceiving the public with
preparations containing no chlorates at all.

SCIENCE TESTIFIES to the
valuable properties of “Klaro !
Tests made by Messrs. Dixon and Byrn, consulting Analytical
Chemists, prove that
is highly efficient as a precipitant of impurities in water.
Photographs reproduced herewith show the condition of water
before and after these tests were made.
The drinking of impure water has caused such widespread
sickness that all doubtful supplies in Wells, Tanks, Dams or
Cisterns should be treated with “Klaro” before the water is
made available for consumption. “Klaro” causes no harmful
effects to drinking or boiler water, if used as per our direc-
tions. It leaves no disagreeable flavor—simply clarifies—
leaving the water clear as crystal.

Australia Riddled with
Deadly Kidney Disease
ALMOST EVERYBODY COMPLAIN INC.
Kidney disease is most certainly on the in-
crease. Thousands and thousands of people
in the towns and villages of this country are
in terrible-danger of deadly kidney disease.
This insidious disease creeps on, gradu-
ally getting a firmer and firmer grip, until
when it is too late the poor sufferer discovers
he has Bright’s Disease. Have you kidney
trouble? Do you know how to recognise
whether you are suffering from this or not?
Here are some of the symptoms of kidney
disease : Aches and pains in various parts of
the body, nasty taste in the mouth first thing
in the morning, constipation, cloudy and bad-
colored urine, general feeling of weakness
and irritability, pufliness under the eyes—
these are all symptoms of kidney trouble.
And then people who suffer from backache,
rheumatism, gout, sciatica, gravel, stone or
pains in the bladder, muscles and joints are
all suffering these pains through weak or
diseased kidneys, for these are the sure and
certain symptoms of kidney trouble.
All these things mean that the kidneys are
weak and diseased. They need strengthening
and making healthy.

box of De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills,
which are made expressly for kidney and
bladder troubles.
To cure rheumatism or any other form of
kidney trouble you must positively get rid of
the cause—the poisonous uric acid. Remem-
ber to do this a real remedy must pass
through the kidneys and the bladder and not
through the bowels, as most kidney pills do.
When you see the urine change to a muddy
bluish color—a feature which distinguishes
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Pills from all
others—you know beyond all doubt that they
have put their healing touch on the right
spot—the kidneys and the bladder. A won-
derful pill—straight to the kidneys—that is
why De Witt’s Pills give such amazingly
quick relief —every time. A permanent cure
follows in almost every case. Look for that
blue-colored urine.
They will cure every one of the above
symptoms no matter how long or bow badly
you have suffered.

VARIOUS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Like Homing Birds.
The children played on the roselit sands,
The roselight tinting their feet and hands,
As ever and ever they danced in glee;
And over the roofs of the little town
And the hills behind the sun Avent down,
Lavish of wealth as a king should be.
The rich lights reddened on ridge and reach,
Yet, watching, I thought of another beach.
Where the “waves cry out with a dirging
sound:
“Oh, pray and pity, and pity and pray,
For here Death moved on a sacred day,
Flinging his largesse of grief around !”
Then up and out of the East there drew,
Each of them lit by the rose-red hue,
White birds of sea with clamorous call;
And the children, watching their flight,
grew dumb,
As home they headed ere night should
come,
Flinging his mantle of gloom o’er all.
And 10, I dreamt in that wondrous hour,
When the sunset flamed like a Tropic flower,
And a pause came over the children’s mirth,
Even as these, do our deathless brave —
White souls winging across the wave —
Homeward hie to their place of birth.
n.s.w.
RODERIC QUINN.
Irish.
My father and mother were Irish,
And Irish must he he,
With a far thought and a long thought,
Who comes to wed with me.
With the clean dreams of the green land
Stored in his heart away,
Deep with the sob of Ireland,
Thrid through Avith laughter gay.
Upon the grass o’ mornings,
He’ll see the faery ring,
And not despise the warnings
The Good Folk bring.
With the soft kiss of the mist-land
His soul shall still be sweet,
For the high emprise of Ireland,
And a great heart’s beat.
To guard that heart from traitor sin
He’s strengthened Avith the shields
Of the gold songs of Erin
Over four green fields.
Oh, he you horn in Sydney,
Or come from far Tralee.
The Irish soul you bring me
Makes you the hoy for me.

NORA McAULIFFE.
Rondeau.
I am in love with sea and sun,
And with the moon, like some pale nun,
That smiles in sadness from on high ;
With daAvn’s rich rose when day is nigh,
With night’s black plumes when day is done.
With each fantastic pattern spun
By cloud sprites, in their careless fun,
Across the blue demesne of sky
I am in love.
The stars my deep regard have won,
The birds that sing when day’s begun;
I smile to hear the night wind sigh;
Spring’s charms devour with eager eye,
Because —the fact I cannot shun—
I am in love !

HARRISON O.
Happy Song.
I am too much alive to sing.
I want to shout and leap and fling
My laughing arms into the air
And dance on tip-toe everywhere.
With not a thought and not a dream,
I want to skip beside a stream
In Arcady, in Arcady.
And woo the wood-gods all to me.
I want to feel them chase me down
Among the grasses green and brown,
With many a mad and merry cry
Of Youth and Gladness ringing high,
Till reeling frolic, drunk with mirth*
Sinks to exhaustion on the earth.
In Arcady, in Arcady !
Tra-la-la-la, who catches me?
N.S.W.
ZORA CROSS.
The Lady.
She smiled into my eyes and said, “Maybe
In time you’ll come to understand me, dear.
When I’m away from you, you long for me;
But still you scold and fret w'hen I am near.
I love you when you smile and Avhen you
frown
With all my heart. The world is upside
down.”
But next day in a cosy little room
She sat with Bilkins, and she crooned to
him !
“I’m yours. I love you so, sunshine or gloom !
Though you doubt still, I love you, sink or
swim !
Love laughs at all we’ve dreamt of, all Ave’ve
planned—
In time to come perhaps you’ll understand.”
A little later, whispering lip to lip,
She fed my blood with kisses, laughing low.
She said, “I’ve given poor old Bill the slip.
Who cares! You’re here, and nothing
matters. So
Love me, my dear. Whatever others do,
I’m yours, yours only, for I’m true to you!”
So, clasped together, with a leap we \yent
Beyond the stars, and I was well content.
To live, to laugh, to love, and—to forget!
I did not any longer scold and fret.
She is a kindly dame, when all is said,
Who flings a starving man a slice of bread.

THE FAMILY DOCTOR GOES ON
STRIKE.
The old dispute between Sawbones and the
Friendly Society which periodically rages over
some part of Australia has been lately stir-
ring Victoria to the boots. And the main
thing about it all is a revelation of social in-
competence. Here is a series of questions in
which every citizen has a vital interest, yet
not even the beginning of a system by which
the questions can be promptly and justly
settled is to be found. The dispute turns
upon the problem whether Sawbones should
be paid 14s. or 20s. per head for each mem-
ber of a society to which he is medical
officer. What he says is that 14s. is not a
fair thing—that 20s. would be. What the
societies say is that 14s. is enough, and that
20s. is monstrous, but they are willing to
give 17s. Having spent many days in contro-
versy over this, the union doctors last week
downed the lancet and the pill, and there
was the grotesque spectacle of the British
Medical Assoc, running a strike. Up to the
time of writing nothing has been heard of
the State issuing a call for “loyal” doctors,
nor did anyqne seem to know where to dis-
cover a formula for reconciling the difference
between 17s. and £l. The attitude of the
societies appeared to be that there was hope
.of a certain number of medical men break-
ing away from the union, while that of the
strike committee was that if poor people are
blistered for 10s. 6d. a visit instead of lid.,
they will be forced to yield the demands made
upon them through their lodges. It looks
a ghastly sort of business, this wrangling
over money for treating the sick, and relying
on human affliction to squeeze money out of
a cashbox ; but there the facts are. The union
of Sawbones simply says: “We will not
have arbitration. These are our terms—take
them or leave them. If you do not take them
we will use the machinery of our organisa-
tion to ensure that the sick citizen who
cannot hand over 10s. 6d. a visit .has a pretty
bad time unless he comes crawling to us as
a pauper.” Yet out of this evil-looking mess
good may come, for the greed and brutality
revealed by the proceedings—they are not all
confined to one side either —cannot fail to
impress the general public with a suspicion
that there is something rotten with a system
out of which such abomination proceeds.
So far as this paper is aware no one can
possibly say whether a medical man is mak-
ing an extortionate or a reasonable demand
in asking that he shall be paid 20s. a year to
attend a member of a friendly society and
his family in time of sickness. This is
taking the thing generally. There are some
practitioners whom The Bulletin would
consider grossly overpaid for the job at 2d.
per month. There are others who would give
good value for £5. What is a moral cer-
tainty is that the yearning of the average
friendly society for cheap medical attend-
ance—for the spot diagnosis and the conse-
quential teaspoonful of something three times
a day ; for a system which drafts men and
women through a stuffy apartment decorated
with a plate bearing the wildly-humorous
“Consulting Room” like sheep through a dip
-—is a pathetic reminder of how tragic
human credulity may be. On the other side
the anxiety of the medical union to continue
in the case of the poorer sections of the com-
munity a system which is in the main an
outrage upon the profession of medicine is
a painful illustration of how resilient a con-
science can become. The friendly society is
in many ways a very admirable institution.
It represents a form of co-operative attempt
to meet the pressure of social conditions
which without some such effort at self-
defence would be insupportable. But there
are some aspects of the business which do
not provoke applause. The medical-attendance
side of these institutions rests upon a basis
which would be none the worse for complete
overhaul. The science of medicine and the
art of surgery are to-day very different things
from what they were when friendly societies
came into being—even from what they were
25 years ago. A system that was good
enough then is all wrong now. The entire
conception of the place of medicine and sur-
gery in the social scheme has altered. At
one time it seemed right that a given number
of people should band together, and by pay-
ing so many pence per week into a common
fund use the proceeds to get for such of them
as might want medical aid the services of a
doctor. To the doctor who would otherwise
have accumulated bad debts for looking at
the tongue of the proletariat the system
offered many advantages. In a sense, it does
so still, provided the pool is big enough. But
it only offers advantages of income. To the
proletariat its advantages are very question-
able. And it is a question of the very first
importance to the State whether the prac-
tice of medicine upon commercial lines, which
secures to an enormous number of citizens
only such service as the poorest among them
can pay for, is socially even tolerable. This
business cannot be limited to the question
whether a friendly society can pay 145..
17s. or 20s. a year per member for medical
attention, or whether a medical man should
derive from the society an income of £OOO or
£l2OO a year. When those passing issues
are solved by Sawbones getting as much as
he can and the wholesale society obtaining
as heavy a discount as possible, both parties
thus getting amicably on the same plane
as the dealers in tripe, a greater issue will
remain where it was. And that is whether
the people directly concerned are securing a
just share of the benefits that might be
derived from medical science, or whether the
medical practitioner is discharging his most
useful function. This paper does not
believe that they are.
* * # *
The treatment and care of the sick is a
social question. It was one of the first
social obligations accepted by man, dating
from the time when he carried the afflicted
individual out into the desert and left him
to die in peace and quiet. It is recognised
in a dozen ways—by the erection.and main-
tenance of hospitals, by the formation of
nursing guilds, by the establishment of
schools of medicine, by the creation of clinics
and dispensaries and Public Health Depart-
ments, and the taking up of collections for
the equipment of medical missionaries to
benighted lands or impoverished slums.
But treatment of the sick is intimately
connected with the care of the sound.
The prevention of illness is as definite
a part of medical science as the elimina-
tion of an appendix. It is of more import-
ance to society that a profession which makes
a special study of, say, those diseases aris-
ing from overcrowding, defective sanitation
and so on should grapple with the causa-
tion of physical disabilities, than that when a
citizen falls victim to illness he should be
a source of income to the profession. As
it is now, the medical man depends upon
the illness and suffering of individuals for
his livelihood; in the case of friendly society
members, the more he can get so much a
head for the better his income will be.
Whether this is better for anything except
the pocket of the practitioner is another
matter. And it is this other matter to
which men and women all over the world
are turning their minds.
* * * *
Social conditions force the medical man,
often against his will and usually against
his ideals, to chase the dollar as hard as
nearly everybody else. His general desire
is to see the community divided into two
mobs —paupers and those who are not of
that class. To the pauper he is prepared to
give certain gratuitous service under certain
conditions. The others he insists must pay.
If they are able to pay something he will
treat them after a fashion in sections at
reduced rates per head. If they are able to
pay more, then they must do so. The
medical man has to live, and is entitled to
get all he can. At any rate, he thinks that
way, and like the lawyer and the cocky and
the bottle-oh. will continue to do so until
changed conditions begin to make him think
otherwise. Wherefore loud, frequent
demands have arisen in Victoria for the
local politician to arise and awake and
nationalise the medical service on non-
competitive principles. If the local politi-
cian were a Bolshevik no doubt he would
proceed to put Sawbones in his place
within 24 hours. But calling upon Premier
Bowser, of Wangaratta, to do this thing is
very like asking Bigjohn Forrest to go out
organising for the A.W.U. Between talking
about making a revolutionary change in the
status of a whole profession and actually
doing the deed there is a vast difference, and
this paper has a strong suspicion that 99
per cent, of the people who make oracular
noises about nationalising medical services
have neither a glimmering of what they want
nor a notion of how they would set about
getting it. Bald statements about making
“all medical men Civil servants and paying
them regular incomes” are meaningless
except for purposes of academic disputation.
As society stands at the moment it is
waste of time to talk about the subject.
What it is not waste of time to talk about
is the duty of the State to secure for its
citizens the opportunity to participate,
regardless of the size of their individual
purse, in all the benefits to be derived from
medical science. To do this —in part, any-
how —it is not necessary to start a contro-
versy about something impossible of realisa-
tion. Through an extension of the functions
of Public Health Departments, the estab-
lishment of hospitals upon the broadest basis
of public utility and the appointment of
district medical officers, a substantial step
would be taken towards the reform that
must inevitably some day come. At the
moment the particular business the Vic-
torian Ministry has in hand is to first dis-
cover whether the system under which
friendly societies and medical men carry on
their joint operations is defensible, and next
to carefully examine the British Medical
Association as a union. It is a registered
body composed of men who are themselves
registered by the State. It has loftily
refused to submit its quarrel with the socie-
ties to arbitration. It has promoted a strike
in time of war—a strike aimed among others
at the families of men who are serving at
the Front. Unions of workmen, with far
more justification for social revolt, have been
held up to obloquy, made the targets of
public resentment and had their registration
cancelled by the courts for doing things far
less morally odious than this association of
professional experts to most of whom the
war has brought increased incomes. The
enormity of this strike is so glaring that if
the Victorian Government allows the thing
to go on it will look about the last thing in
senility. Objectionable though the War
Precautions Act has been made, there could
be no excuse for the Federal Government
refusing to exercise its authority under that
measure and dealing with the Medical Asso-
ciation as it has dealt with other combina-
tions of recalcitrant monopolists.
SCOFFING AT THE AFFLICTED.
Last week certain well-meaning persons got
together at Melbourne and added a trifle to
the superfluous eloquence whose dead weight
already makes Australia tip up at one side,
causing tidal waves and other disturbances.
The Governor-General spoke a piece about
what ought to be done in the way of promot-
ing industry, and was as sensible and as
forcible as an Excellency is permitted to be.
Then Senator Millen, Federal Minister for
Repatriation, held high discourse on the sub-
ject of his dead horse. Carefully shying off
the awkward questions of the need for local
shipbuilding on a big scale, for great local:
iron and steel works and for all manner of
“secondary” industries, he babbled at length
about the necessity for settling people on
the land —returned soldiers and others. This
was Millen, condensed :
The problem was how to bring the land and the
persons desirous of settling upon it together. The
thing that stood between was the capital necessary
to provide plant and equipment.... Might they not
utilise the public capital, etc.
Now, where, in this country which under the
present system doesn’t even contrive to pay
the everyday expenses of Government with-
out the aid of borrowed money, and which
charges all its public-works expenditure to
loans—where is the “public capital” that
Millen talks about? The public shortage
is visible enough, but that is another thing.
And why doesn’t the eloquent but ordinary
senator say something about a free railway
ticket for the farmer who wants to get off
the land ; also a free lunch for him on his
journey ?
Australia’s Lose-the-War Government is
invited to consider the latest developments.
Lord Rhondda, the British Minister for
Hunger and Food Shortage (that is not his
official title, but it very well describes the
nature of the job he is up against), has
broken the news to the United States that
unless that country can supply 75,000,000
more bushels of wheat than it has exported
up to January 2 it is impossible to say that
there Mtill be enough provender in the Allied
countries to make the war a success. An
army travels on its stomach and fights on its
stomach, but not on its empty stomach. And
Uncle Sam has replied manfully that the
food will be there up to time, and that the
.ships to carry it will also be there. Already
restrictions are being put on the consumption
of wheat and meat in George Washing-
ton’s country, so that the big surplus avail-
able for the use of the hungry Allies who
stand in the fighting line in Europe may be
a little bigger. Nobody makes any attempt
now to disguise the fact that victory and
victuals go together, and that without a
reasonable supply of victuals the prospect is
gloomy. The British Minister for Hunger
and Food Shortage didn’t send any cable-
gram to Australia on the subject of an
extra wheat supply, because Australia has
vanished out of ’notice in this connection.
It has sunk into contempt or beneath con-
tempt. The bottom fell out of its great land
settlement and imported-goods policy when it
struck its one real emergency. It crumpled
up at the first time of asking. The country
has about 8,000,000 tons of wheat on hand,
but it has also a Ministry which, after more
than three years’ consideration, hasn’t devel-
oped enough knowledge to be a success as a
common carrier, like the humble individual
who shifts a trunk to the railway station.
True it is now getting a few belated ships
built by Private Enterprise in the United
States, after completely ignoring the offer
made nearly a year ago by local Private
Enterprise in the shape of the Broken Hill
Proprietary Co. to wade in strenuously at
the building of steel vessels. This was
characteristic of the Hughes Administra-
tion. It is a stalwart believer in Govern-
ment control of industry and a staunch
opponent of Private Enterprise—unless it is
the foreign article. And it has a great talent
for discouraging local skill, having the
Foreign-trader’s childlike faith in the advisa-
bility of importing things. It couldn’t im-
port the silos in which the unsaleable wheat
is to be stored, but probably it would have
done so if it could. It is the sort of com-
bination that would gladly import post-holes
and bi-eathe nothing but bottled air brought
from the Saliai-a.
« * * *
This paper urges Senator Millen and his
party to cease insulting the farmer with their
lavish conversation about land settlement.
That individual has had his wheat comman-
deered by the Government at a low rate, lie
has guessed for quite a while, as he saw it
accumulating at stations and sidings along-
side the wonderful loan-money railways
which never manage to meet their interest
bill, that even the very modest payment is
precarious, and now he realises that it may
stop altogether in another year or so. He
has missed a great deal of profit that might
have been made by prompt disposal of his
sui-plus ci-op. He knows that people of his
own race and their allies are going hungry
for want of the crop, and he has a suspicion
that Germany is holding out the glad hand
to him on that account, and saying “Well
done, good and useful traitor!” To be lec-
tured about the need for increased land
settlement, and to be threatened with the
competition of a new crowd of farmers sub-
sidised in one way or another by “public
capital,” are matters that don’t cheer him.
Millen and co. are invited to remember that
the person who throws the mud of sarcasm
at the agriculturist who is down is un-
worthy of the name he bears —whatever it
may be.
* * * *
The lazy, easy, shiftless policy of low
revenue tariffs and huge imports has burst,
as already mentioned, and Hughes is its
prophet—likewise Millen. The importation
of capital in the shape of loans, the importa-
tion of ships, of almost all our clothing and
machinery and implements, of a great part
of our railways (they were brought out in
parts from better informed countries, and
Australia supplied the land), the importa-
tion of hats and hurdy-gurdies and corn-
sacks and cups and saucers and railway
managers and bug experts and a thousand
other things saved incapable political leadei-s
a heap of trouble in teaching the nation the
way it should go, and made it a very humble
dependent on foreign aid. A million times
Australia has been warned that if Britain
lost command of the sea and imports were
cut off it would become little better than an
aborigine becaxise it didn’t learn to do things
in a big way beyond tearing raw produce
out of the ground. Britain hasn’t lost com-
mand of the sea, but the dislocation of sea
carriage through the w-ar has brought along
about 5 per cent, of the possible catas-
trophe. And this country will be very naked
and vei-y much ashamed if another 5 per
cent, arrives, let alone the whole catastrophe.
The Bulletin doesn’t believe that the
political shuffler who is Dictator of Aus-
tralia cares twopence for the gi-eat import-
ing policy except as a matter of conveni-
ence and habit arising out of convenience.
But he has no visible qualifications except a
terrible fluency and a marvellous capacity
for hanging on to office. Nobody can dream
of him tackling a big policy with a view to
making Australia a self-dependent country;
that would be work for Hercules, not
Hughes. The difference between the old
god and the bustling and talkative modern
politician has been noted by many observers.
It isn’t on record that the former made a
single lengthy speech during his .famous
labors, and he never gave way to terror and
swore in 59 special constables.
FAITH.
In the trinity of noblest thought Faith has
the first place. It is the strong undertone
in human life, the structure on which most
other things that men regard as worth while
are built; but it requires a lot of assistance
from the companion graces Hope and
Charity to enable it to keep its torch alight
in the flickering and variable winds of the
world. Still, that assistance is generally
forthcoming; and it is marvellous how in
such a matter as the present war the true
believers outnumber the doubters and pessi-
mists. We are going to lick the Kaiser. Of
that the man in the tram is assured and the
fiercest anti-gambler would wager his next
year’s income upon it, as a patriotic duty.
The breaking-up of Russia, the devouring of
Roumania, the smashing of the Italian line
and the hunger that grips the British
stomach have scarcely an effect on public-
opinion. The war can have only one con-
clusion —the conclusion that public opinion
desires. Yet national faith has not always
been justified. For five hundred years
Montenegro held her rugged rocks in the
belief that she would finally x-estore the
ancient Serb empire. Her great legendary
hero lay asleep in one of the mountain caves,
some day to awake and drive off the
oppressor who held the fruitful lower
country. Never in all the years did the
Montenegrin lose faith, but with knife and
blue metal hung to his eagle nest waiting
for the glorious resurrection. And then the
Austrian cannon battered down the defences
the Turk could never take, and the faith
was i-educed to very small potatoes in the
neighboi-hood of Salonika. It may be justi-
fied yet, but not by the power of Ivan the
Black nor the mountaineer’s knife. Simi-
larly, the faith of the Welsh in the return
of Arthur and of the Poles that they could
regain the old territory where their former
nobility had treated them like dogs has worn
very thin and sorry with the ages. It may
be that the long wish behind the faith may
in almost every case materialise at last, but
it does not do so in a way that gives, much
satisfaction to the earliest and best believers.
St. James, who solidly maintained that faith
wasn’t worth a row of .Chinese crackers
unless it had a solid backing of works, has
been justified on every page of human his-
tory.
Yet faith is a tremendous weapon. The
belief of the Allied peoples that they must


win gives a tremendous impetus to every
offensive and keeps the grin good on the faces
of suffering peoples when the pain of war
racks most. Unfortunately, the Teuton faith
appears to be almost as firmly entrenched ;
and the game now being played in Europe
is mostly one of trying to shake the other
fellow’s confidence by a long-distance fire of
aggressive speech. If the German could by
any means be made to understand that he
hasn’t a chance the war would soon be over;
but, on all appearances, the only way in
which that can be proved to him is by
making him too dead to hear the Kaiser’s
speeches. Behind all is, of course, the gen-
eral theory that right triumphs over might.
It is an idea inculcated by all religions and
by every nursery tale; but in practice it
doesn’t amount to much. Not only can a
little oblique reasoning make the wrongest
thing look right in certain circumstances,
hut the establishment of any direct codes
of right and wrong in such a business as
war becomes itself an impossibility. Out-
side the Ten Commandments, which are all
smashed to dust by both sides at the first
blare of the war-trumpet, the only code of
right is the consensus of opinion of a com-
munity ; and as there lire two distinct and
opposing communities in any war, so there
must be two distinct codes. That is why
both sides strenuously pray to God to help
them, with perfect earnestness and no sense
of hypocrisy. So faith in the ultimate
triumph of right is double-barrelled; and the
faithful face one another to bomb the rival
righteousnesses into each other’s souls. The
thing can work itself out in no possible way
except as a commentary on the opinion of
St. James that faith without works is dead ;
for works are the onlv thing in which people
can have faith during the struggles of
nations. That the Allied faith is stronger
than the German faith seems probable, but
it can only remain so if the Allies’ works or
potential works are stronger. That is why
politicians still brag in the face of partial
defeat, and tired armies sweat and swear to
make the bragging good. If faith could win
without works it would be easier and
cheaper; but faith can only remove moun-
tains with a pick and shovel and get guns out
of the road with high explosives.
Yet justification by faith, without real toil
having a look in, is still the religion of a lot
of people who steadily keep their coats on
in the face of tremendous issues. Nowhere does
the doctrine seem to be more deeply rooted and
grounded in the popular imagination than in
Australia. A Win-the-War party with in-
tense jaw-power is in office, but our share of
the war is not being waged by Australia at
all. It has been undertaken by individuals
who, acting on their own initiative, have
decided to pull down the Kaiser for the
benefit of the race. As a Commonwealth our
faith in victory is, therefore, a faith in
something which as a Commonwealth we
decided not to attempt. But it is not only
to the war that this applies. Australians
are supposed to have great faith in Aus-
tralia. Any politician of any color will
brag that in the ears of the faithful; but
what does the brag really amount to? Has
there been any sort of. indication on the part
of the people as a whole that they are will-
ing to unitedly develop the continent of their
faith? Private citizens work to that end
and other private citizens loaf or exert them-
selves in an altogether onposite direction;
but the works, that should prove our faith
are mostly occasional noises of the political
people on the eve of an election. Take an
outstanding example. Eighteen years ago
the new Australian Federation was supposed
to have abolished trade restrictions at the
State boundaries; but because of the broken
railway gauges those restrictions have not
in a real sense been abolished yet. If the
progress of Australian works, wffiich are the
only basis of Australian faith, can go no
faster than this, what is the faith worth?
Montenegro looking for the resurrection of
Ivan the Black seems less futile than Aus-
tralia clinging to brag in the face of the
political calamity of successive do-nothing-
in-particular Ministries. But the winning
of the war is our first concern; and the
brag to the faithful has shifted its centre of
interest to the bombing of Berlin and the
slaughter of the Kaiser. Some day, to the
infinite sorrow of our politicians, the war
will end; and then the faith that really re-
moves mountains of incapacity and talk may
have its innings. For there are men who
really believe in Australia, and some of them
must sooner or later get into one of our 14
Houses of Parliament, or otherwise assert
themselves. Australians are not without
works to justify their faith in their own
capabilities; it is Australia in the mass that
fails. The dynamic force of reform must
lie in the faith of those who have really done
things, and they are not numbered among
our present politicians.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Is the Farmer Being Fleeced Again?
There was a steady demand in Sydney last
week by speculators in wheat scrip, and a
good deal of business was done. While these
transactions were going on argument was
proceeding in the wheat-growing States as to
whether it was worth while planting any more.
The discussion arose from a combination of
circumstances which included- (1) semi-
official recommendations to Cocky to take
to cultivating flocks and herds; (2) a
general feeling that if more wheat is pro-
duced it will be devoured by mice and other
wild animals; (3) an announcement by
Hughes that no buyer has yet been dis-
covered for the current harvest; (4) a
popular impression that, in the absence of
shipping and buyers, Australian Govern-
ments in “financing” farmers to grow addi-
tional wheat would be going full speed
towards blue ruin; and (5) a suspicion that
the whole situation regarding wheat pools
and all the rest of it has fallen into chaos.
The net result of all of which is that people
who are not wheat growers are risking their
money on a theory that something satisfac-
tory is on the eve of happening, and the
citizens who actually deliver the goods are
in a state of pathetic uncertainty as to
whether it is worth while producing any
more. The position is not creditable to
any of the Governments concerned. Unless
this is altered, and quickly, too, it will be
mightily discreditable. It has been stated
by Prime Minister Hughes that the wheat
in sight in Australia cannot all be shipped
for four years. There is the additional
statement that for the 1917-8 harvest there
are no buyers. If this represents the bases
upon which Cocky must consider himself
and his future, it would seem to be plain
lunacy to continue on the old lines and to
be the plain duty of the Federal Ministry to
severely limit the guarantee of 4s. a bushel
promised on the 1918-9 harvest. If it does
not —if there is likelihood of transport being
made available, and if the British and
American Governments can be prevailed
upon to give a plain answer to the question
whether they want Australia to grow wheat
—then it might be madness for the Common-
wealth not to plough the last available acre.
It can be taken as a moral certainty that if
this and subsequent harvests are to be piled
up in stacks to be soaked with rain and
overrun by mice and weevil for four years,
the rest of the story is going to be entirely
devoid of humor. But an emissary of the
British Wheat Commission has discovered a
method of preservation, and if this be effec-
tive one of the great dangers of production
is removed. It is certain that the world is
growing desperately short of wheat—that to
supply her Allies America is being stripped
of every bushel that can be spared. Britain,
France, Italy and the United States want
wheat as urgently as they want shells. It
is no part of this paper’s job to advise the
Australian farmer to grow more wheat, but
it is part of its job to call on the Federal
and State Ministries to face this matter in
a way that can be understood. Nearly all
of them are given to spasmodic blithering
about their anxiety to “organise industry.”
Well, this particular industry is, on the side
of production at any rate, organised suffi-
ciently to produce millions of tons a year.
The organisation of the marketing has been
taken over by the various Governments; but
because of a yearning to do everything in
secret, or because of ineradicable ineptitude,
the possibilities of the business being landed
into a state of complete disorganisation look
fairly numerous. What The Bulletin
wants to know is whether Hughes will
make a full statement as to what the Wheat
Board is doing, as to what the programme
of the British and American Governments is
in respect to Australian wheat, as to the
measures that are being taken to protect
the stocks already on the premises and the
possibility or impossibility of shipping being
diverted from the Atlantic to the only place
in the world with a surplus of cereals await-
ing transport. If he will not, then the time
is about ripe for the States to take a hand
in the proceedings independently of the
Commonwealth. The existing uncertainty is
preposterous, and only needs nrolonging for
a few months to be disastrous. If
the Allies cannot send for Australian wheat
and are not looking hitherwards for further
supplies, why not say so at once? If they
do want Australia’s wheat and will be able
to liberate shipping from the Atlantic to
get it, then why not make the grower as
wise as the speculator in scrip?

The State as Storekeeper.
From a man who has grown up in the
business: —
It should be possible for a scheme of price-fixing
to be brought about within the trade. All but the
straight-out business shark will admit that protection
should be granted to the lowest paid or most improvi-
dent class as Tar as certain of the necessities of life
are concerned. Price-fixing as at present practised
by well-meaning amateurs, however, is the crude
rule-of-thumb sort of thing the doctrinaire evolves
out of an excellent theory, and it fails because its
basis is unsound. I have had a finger in a good few
“honorable understandings” (as price-fixing is called
when it isn’t done to win a War), but they never
went beyond “bread-and-butter lines,” as the trade
calls them—goods that everybody buys. These are
the lines most frequently cut and most in need of
protection. Any attempt at comprehensive price-
raising has failed, because someone always broke
away—just as Government price-lowering is failing
now, because nearly everybody is chancing prosecu-
tion. The Prices Board dabbles in too many things
—pokes its little stick into too many interacting
business cogs.
In a free market price-manipulation is done far
more to regulate demand and output than as a sinis-
ter result of “combining.” It is an ordinary busi-
ness process that acts instantly, even in a tiny
suburban pie-shop. Profiteering in staple lines
defeats its own end, for people cease to buy luxury-
lines at a certain point, and they so raise Cain about
the price of bread-and-butter ones that no combine
would dare face the music.
In every shop there are certain lines that fail to
pay directly, yet they are stocked by every store,
except a few of the great “multiples,” which are
strong enough to defy both manufacturers and public
demand. Generally they are commodities so widely
advertised by their proprietors that they sell them-
selves. I can call to mind a tea, a pill or two, a
galatea, a boot, a shovel, a kerosene, a whisky. They
are called “proprietaries,” arid it is for these the
shopkeeper always offers a substitute “just as good”
—often it really is so; and always it pays better. The
proprietors of these non-paying lines give the ad.-
men their big profit-margin instead of the retailer,
who only stocks the lines because he may lose trade
if he doesn’t. Avoiding their sale shows the re-
tailer’s adeptness as a salesman, and his justification
for being there at all.
Now, as a basis for a price-fixing scheme, I suggest
a State adoption of the proprietaiy-article idea. Let
the State choose and put upon the market a series
of State-originated staple commodities sufficient for
the whole simple needs of a people— and fix the
prices of them. The State would control the produc-
tion of these, from the seed to the completed article,
so that the parasitic middleman might be entirely
eliminated.
Men outback have told me that in the early days
they have done well and provided for a family on the
old weekly station-ration of “10-10-2-4”—101b. flour,
101 b. meat, 21b. sugar, and Alb. tea—augmented by
the ancient £1 a week in cash. The State might
therefore choose as its own “proprietaries” a whole-
meal flour, a joint, a cheap but wholesome sugar, a
tea, a flannel, a cotton cloth, a tweed, a wool, a
burning oil, a hardwood timber—even (if anxious
for work) a boot, a suit, a hat, a tobacco, a beer, a
furniture suite, a go-cart, a corset and a chewing-
gum —grown on its own farms by its own labor and
made up in its own factories (it already has some of
them), selling each commodity at its actual produc-
ing-cost f.a.s. at the place of distribution. The rest
could well be left to Private Enterprise, business
competition and our old friend Supply-and-Demand.
(It will be noticed the war has forced Britain to do
a little in this way. My father is using yards of
good ad.-space to beg people to come and buy sugar
from him at no profit at all!)
Retailers would gladly stock the State lines for the
sake of the other custom they would bring. If they
gave credit for State goods, delivered them, or other-
wise piled up “overhead” on their sale, it would
be the retailers’ own funeral. The people, even the
poorest, woidd be able to get in any centre whole-
some if not luxurious living, at bedrock cost unin-
flated by middleman’s wiles; and what more could
anyone ask? This done, ordinary business competi-
tion could be left to handle other commodities.
Such a system would save the State the heavy cost
of distribution in State shops—the item that has
euchred State commercial experiments in the past.
The State does not avail itself half enough of the
“customs of the trade”—an allowance post-office
never “pays” the allowee; but did one ever hear of
a shopkeeper refusing to take the job on?
Rule-of-thumb price-fixing as at present carried
out is illogical, often grossly unfair to i ho “fixed”
and satisfactory to no one. It, moreover, puts a
premium on dishonesty and evasion of the Law, and
that is bad for any member of a community, even a
grocer.

A Possible Funeral for Party
Government.
Dear Bulletin, —Last night the previous
clog next door kept me half awake by his
discourse with the subsequent cat up the
street, and I dreamed about a way to under-
mine the Party Government curse. (Perhaps
the idea isn’t new, but that can’t be helped.)
Let Tudor move :
This House has completely lost confidence in the
Prime Minister, Mr. Hughes, and, besides, it never
had any.
Probably the Speaker would rule the motion
out of order, but a majority can disagree
from the Speaker’s ruling. The House hav-
ing disagreed, let Tudor state his case
against the Dictator with all the force at his
command, but say not one syllable against
the other Ministers. Let instructions be
passed to his followers to stick to the doings
of the Dictator, and speak nothing except in
kindness about liis colleagues. Of course
there are difficulties. First, it would be
hard to prevent the rank and file from flying
off the handle, and attacking the Cabinet in
general, thereby including them in the gen-
eral condemnation and driving them to sup-
port the leader of whom they are so very
tired. Secondly, the move would imply that
Tudor refrained from pegging out his pros-
pective allotment on the Treasury bench—
that he made no claim whatever and left the
question of Hughes’s successor quite open.
To prevent newspaper paragraphs about
coalitions, or the division of the skin before
the bear’s death, or about how Smith (who
is uncertain) may become Trade Commis-
sioner at Punta Arenas, or how Jones (who
wobbles) is marked down to make inquiries
about shipbuilding at Timbuctoo, Tudor’s
followers and well-wishers should simply
receive an intimation at the last moment like
this: —
Be in your place when the House meets, and vou
may see an INTERESTING DOG-FIGHT.
Certainly the leader of the Opposition might
get neither place nor pay out of the business
for himself, but on the other hand he
couldn’t get less than he is getting now. If
he failed he would be remembered as the
man who blazed a new track and hit an old
superstition intelligently in the waistcoat.
He would extend his influence whether he
won on lost. And if success came his way
he might work out on top in the general
scramble and breakage. To the man who
established the rule that the House can sack
an obnoxious Minister without being com-
pelled to sacrifice the entire Ministry many
things would be possible. The first result
of the victory would be visible when Hughes
went to Government House with a new
reconstruction scheme, and was told that he
was the only man in Parliament who was
disqualified.—Yours, etc., Henry Horse-
collar.

Unemployment Insurance.
Unemployment insurance is one of the
newest Ma State schemes for spending money
and buying the applause that means votes.
It is a German device, and it worked well in
Germany before the war. Thanks to a high
scientific tariff and a fine system of technical
education, there was work for practically
every able-bodied Hun bar lunatics, and a
very able-bodied law pursued the impecuni-
ous loafer with a job in both hands. In easy-
going Australia the Government flatly re-
fuses to find more work for the able-bodied
citizen —the aged and crippled are already
provided for by old age and invalid pensions
—per medium of a tariff like that of Ger-
many and an anti-loafing policy akin to that
of the spiked-helmet country. In other
words, there is a tendency to adopt the
spending part of the German policy, but no
other part. The cost, in consequence, is
likely to be bigger than anticipated. That is
always so. As a case in point, consider the
Federal outlay for old age and invalid pen-
sions. There was no increase in the pension
rates between 1910 and 1916. The invoice
didn’t include war pensions. There was
nothing to cause a great increase in hopeless
invalids among those who didn’t go to war.
There was no special outbreak of poverty.
The population grew by only 10 per cent.
The aged didn’t grow old any faster than
usual. Yet old age and invalid pensions rose
from £1,497.485 in 1910 to £2 891.597 for the
12 months to June, 1916. That is to say,
they very nearly doubled. It was a jump in
six years from 6s. 9d. per inhabitant per
annum to 11s. lOd. per inhabitant. That
doesn’t prove fraud or mal. dministration or
carelessness, but it does prove that the hill
has a tendency to grow up in the night like
Jonah’s gourd without visible cause; and
an eye should be kept on all such vegetables.
The City State.
The large boasts of an empire on which
the sun never sets, or of a federation spread-
ing over so many thousand miles of fertile
territory, which have been absurdly mixed
up with the idea of patriotism in the past,
should have a lot of stones thrown at them
now when the world is on the eve of redis-
tribution of rights and reorganisation of
nations. Size, wealth, territorial expansion
and the like are not the things that make
a nation or a people great. The man who
owns a big, badly-cultivated farm is not
greater in any sense than the man who has
a small one which has been taught to grow
things to its utmost limit. No sane person
would say that Babylon was a greater city
than Athens, although it was probably a
hundred times larger, or that the vast empire
of the Moguls was worthier than the in-
finitely smaller empire of Augustus. It is
cjuality and not quantity that makes a State
great or small ; and the only conceivable
reason for a far-reaching empire is the sup-
ply of man-power for special extravagances
of stoush. If world-peace under an inter-
national police system could be established,
there would be nothing more desirable than
a return to the old city State, or something
as like it as possible. The tendency of large
States is to keep a dead level of mediocrity
in all matters that really count, while the
small State, complete within itself, can leap
away into the front ranks of progress and do
things in the waiting for which the hearts
of the people in a larger community would
be broken. The two greatest world-influ-
ences in the history of man were those of
Athens and Jerusalem; and both could to-
day be lost in the meat jungle of Chicago.
.
The True Story of the Celtic Movement,
Trousers are the emblem of the great Celtic
victory over the races of the earth.
Crushed, beaten, bruised by the various mobs
of Teutonic plunderers who in turn deso-
lated Europe, the Celt won to final triumph
by imposing on the legs of all nations his
own ancestral bags. When the bare-legged
Roman struck the Gallic tribes beyond the
Alps the first thing he noticed about them
Was that they wore trousers; and the
antiquity of the garments in other Celtic
lands is proved by the sculptured efiigies of
certain early residents of Ireland which still
preserve in mouldering stone the tailoring
modes of a very ancient time. How deep
and far the conspiracy to clothe the nether
limbs of the nations must have gone can be
judged by the fact that, to allay all sus-
picion, those astute Celts adopted the kilt
to their own discomfort, and gradually wove
a web of desire for the discarded pants
about their future victims. After a long
night of agony the Irish section of the Celtic
race was heard at the beginning of the 19th
century making a loud outcry about the loss
of its Parliament and the breaking of the
Treaty of Limerick and other matters; but
secretly it was keeping its tongue in its
cheek. For in truth the triumph of the race
had begun to blossom on the ancient stem.
Man by man the English people became
trousered; race by race the nations of
Europe followed the fashion. The move-
ment reached America, spread to Africa,
touched the uttermost bounds of Asia. Mis-
sionaries preached trousers to the heathen ;
picturesque Oriental potentates put their
robes aside to wrestle with braces and but-
tons ; the very feminist movement itself
hoisted them as its banner and insignia. And
the Celt, particularly the Irish Celt, looked
on and smiled. Without a blow he had con-
quered the male world up to the waist.
Fired with the splendor of the triumph, the
Celtic literary revival made an assault upon
the top end of the human race. Rapidly
it is subduing the brain and heart of man-
kind ; and while it is doing so, France—the
splendidly Celtic France which stands as the
noblest defender of freedom and well-cooked
meals —has made its delicate attack upon the
world-stomach. So the victory promises to
be - complete all along the line; for when
trousers and food and thought combine they
are practically masters of the whole man.
True, in spite of submarines, Britain con-
tinues to rule the waves; but she does so in
ancient Irish trousers of the very widest
sort. What matters the nailing of colors to
the mast if the very holder of the hammer
and tacks has the sign of the conqueror
buttoned on his legs?
«
If Germany didn’t pay somebody for this,
then somebody did a job for Germany at
much too cheap a price. The Allies are in
great danger of being starved into submis-
sion. This country’s men don’t very seri-
ously matter to Germany; but to keep Aus-
tralia from sending away its 8,000,000 tons
of wheat —enough to feed Britain and its
army for a year—is worth millions to Ger-
many. Now, on July 27 last, according to
Holman, Premier of N. S. Wales, “a definite
proposal was made by the Broken Hill Prop.
Co. for the commencement of shipbuilding
in this State.” On inquiry as to what pre-
cisely it was prepared to do, the eo. inti-
mated that “it would immediately commence
the building of four steel ships of about 5000
tons.” The offer of this powerful and ener-
getic co. with ample resources of steel and
money was made on July 27. At the end of
January—six months later—not a tap of
work had been done; and Lord Rhondda,
the British Food Commissioner, was cabling
to the U.S.A. that if food wasn’t forthcoming
the Allies must give in. Now, who was re-
sponsible? Who served Germany, for money
or otherwise? Holman blames the Federal
Government. This paper doesn’t know. All
it knows is that it is somebody, and it is a
solemn national duty to find him (or them)
out.
From Meredith Atkinson, director of
tutorial classes at the University of Sydney:
For the past 14 years in Britain and the past
four years in Australia and other Dominions, there
has been at work a most sueessful organisation,
whose sole object is the education of democracy, on
the lines lately laid down by The Bulletin. I refer
to the Workers’ Educational Association. At the
present moment in Britain there is not a professor
of distinction who has not given splendid service to
democracy as a teacher in one of the numerous
classes conducted by the W.E.A. The method of
one-hour lecture, followed by one hour’s discussion,
reinforced by essay work and a good library, is
steadily giving to the working class of England the
knowledge and social enthusiasm essential to the
.success of democracy. We have mingled the very
elite of the Universities and the workers so suc-


REDUCING THE FARMER’S EXPENSES.
Every farmer in the Commonwealth knows how the cost of his necessities has increased during the last few years. Any scheme which will reduce
his expenses should, therefore, command his earnest attention.
Ti e Farmers’ & Settlers’Co-operative Insurance Co. of A
ustralia
i Limited
is designed for one object—to CHEAPEN THE COST OF FARMERS’ INSURANCE.
Farmers’ insurance business is productive of good profits, and the farmer-promoters of this Company realised that if the farmers of the Commonwealth
could be organised to co-operate to undertake their own insurances, the profits would be retained for distribution among the co-operating po.ici
holders themselves —thus materially reducing the cost of their insurances.
This Company was formed for that purpose over two years ago; and thousands of farmers have already co-operated. Dividends of SIX PER CENT,
were paid on the operations of each of the two years.
STANDARD RATES. ABSOLUTE SECURITY.
No other office can offer the farmer more; but by becoming a co-operator in the Farmers’ and Settlers’ Co-operative Insurance Co. of Australia, Ltd., he
is eligible to share in the entire profits. Full, particulars will be supplied on application to the Manager.

cessfully that there is not a University or a trade
union whose thought is not being transformed.
More tangible evidence of success may be found
in the fact that the Ministry of Reconstruction in
England is dominated by three W.E.A. men; the
president of the Board of Education is one of our
most ardent supporters, the present enthusiasm for
his Education Bill having been entirely generated
by the W.E.A. In N. S. Wales alone we have over
1000 students taking three-year courses in
economics, sociology, political science, etc., while
working at their various trades and professions.
Much the same is happening in all other States.
Our first little crop of members of Parliament were
returned, at the last elections. The movement is
not spectacular, but will certainly bring about The
Bulletin's objective of an educated democracy.
Every one of our students becomes a teacher and
a missionary, with no incentive but the propagation
of his knowledge. There is only one city in Aus-
tralasia from whose press we get no assistam e what-
ever—it is Sydney.
Good; but The Bulletin’s proposal went
further than voluntary education. It pro-
posed a simple examination to qualify a per-
son for future enrolment.

The Pending Collision.
That there have been serious riots and
strikes in Germany seems to be a fact; and
the suggestion that the disturbances are part
of an elaborate system of camouflage for the
undoing of the Allies may be swept aside as
too ridiculous to bother about. It is con-
ceivable that the official Hun may find com-
fort in the reflection that news of “indus-
trial unrest” in the Fatherland will en-
courage the proletariat elsewhere to get
restless. But it is inconceivable that Pots-
dam should not prefer to carry on business
without the strike and the distribution of
inflammatory literature and crowds of men
and women yelling outside the palace for
peace and food. For once disturbances of
this kind get into working order, how far
they will go and what the consequences will
be is beyond the wit of anyone to foretell —
especially if the pantry is getting empty.
In all probability the unpleasantness in
Germany is an indication of the supply of
food being desperately short rather than of
popular anxiety to challenge the authority
of the mailed fist. If this is so the circum-
stance will most certainly encourage the
Kaiser to push on with the offensive on the
Western Front and in the direction of Italy.
Apart from the domestic usefulness of secur-
ing a victory if the thing is possible, there
are strong military reasons why the German
should attack the Allies with all the force
at his command without delay. There ap-
pears to be a general belief that the enemy
intends to move more or less promptly.
Whether the fronts will hold firm remains
to be seen, but we had better get out of our
mind any lurking ideas that France will
be able to withstand this sort of thing
indefinitely. She has been most terribly
mauled, and the warning given last year by
Joffre to the United States Congress rested
upon something more solid than rumor.
Uncle Sam is urgently wanted at the place
where everything else is being decided, and
the man from over the Atlantic will be
called upon to take a very much more im-
portant part in the disturbance by the end
of the year than was previously imagined.
Britain and America may yet, indeed, stand
almost alone between European democracy
and a militarist mastery of every nation in
Europe and of many far distant.
♦
The Way to Berlin.
Pessimists are remarking that the Huns
seem in a fair way to do unto the Allies all
that the Allies threatened to do unto them.
Germany was to be starved into submission ;
it is the Allies that tremble for their food
supply. Germany was to be invaded from Italy
via Austria ; it is Austria that holds a bit
of Italy. At the beginning of last year
Bonar Law talked knowingly of what a dif-
ference it would make if we could detach one
of her allies from ‘ Germany. Then came the
detachment of our Russian ally from us.
Our side is the biter that has been bitten —
thus far. But there is at least one good
chance to hoist the Huns with their own
petard. Germany for three years has
threatened to make Britain sue for peace
by bombing and bombarding her non-com-
batant population in unfortified towns.
When shall we begin to test German forti-
tude in the same way? Germany’s eager
expectation of a panic throughout Britain
as the result of aerial raids argues that she
judged British civilian character by her own.
How much longer is the world to Avait before
Huns at home are put to a trial under which
they were sure an enemy would crumple?
A Maoriland soldier, long-time prisoner in
Germany, but hoav interned in Switzerland,
says that he witnessed the first of the Brit-
ish air raids on Mannheim, and, “though it
failed, it had a considerable effect upon the
people. He is convinced that if raids were
continued vigorously they would do much
to hasten the end of the war.” Since then
there have been raids on Mannheim which
didn’t fail, and the latest bombing of Karls-
ruhe is said to have moved a large section ot
the population to march around town howl-
ing for peace. If we can thrash the llnns
anywhere it is surely in the air, where their
40 years of preparation, their organisation,
their central position and strategic railways
don’t count.
♦
The boldest woman this paper has met for
a day or two is Miss Ettie Rout, hon. sec.
of the Maoriland Soldiers’ Medical Club at
Hornchurch, Essex, England. The purpose
of this club, “established with the approval
of the M.L. military authorities in England
and at their request'’ is “to provide members
of the M.L. Expeditionary Force with the
necessary articles for the medical prevention
of venereal disease.” Says Miss Rout:
If it were possible for me to run a properly-
conducted licensed house for our troops here I
would do it, for the sake of protecting the M.L.
nation against further invasion by venereal disease.
It is not possible to do that at present, and therefore
we have to rely merely on prophylactics... .1 or
three years we have refused to accept our soldiers
views: that women are indispensable. The result
has been utterly deplorable. In the nature of
things we M.L. war-workers can give only social
values to our men abroad; the “other women give
more. I think it is clearly my duty to see that
this latter “giving” is done under reasonably safe
conditions. There will be neither more nor less
because of the element of safety. But the dreadful
menace will be removed from many a M.L. soldier's
home, and his children and grandchildren escape the
blighting mildew of venereal disease.
So this brave woman, recognising that
“patriotic funds” may be jeopardised it used
for the purpose without the express sanction
of the subscribers, is making her own appeal
(money may be sent care of the High Com-
missioner for M.L.) ; though, seeing that,
according to official records, the war services
of from 00 to 70 Maorilanders are being tem-
porarily lost every week through infection,
there ought to be no question whatever about
supplying the necessary money from public
funds. The medical authority that under-
takes to cure a disease and pay the sufferer
wages while he is in hospital, but won’t pre-
vent the disease, surely has a kink in its
intellect.
Presumably the public knows by this time
whv the building of ships to move our grain
and help the very nearly starving Allies h'as
not been started in Australia. Apart from
the suspicion that it has been made profitable
to some people to stand in the way, it will
be noticed that, so far as the Commonwealth
Government is concerned, prodigious efforts
have been exerted throughout to throw the
entire responsibility for delay upon the
unions. When the Broken Hill Prop, offered
in the middle of last year to build four 5000
tons ships at once, it did not say: “We’ll do
this if we can make an agreement with
unions beforehand not to have any rows.’
The co. was prepared to take the risks, as
every business man has to. When ploughing-
time comes round a farmer doesn’t leave liis
teams unyoked until lie can get an under-
taking that there won’t be any labor troubles
during harvest. If he did the world would
soon be without wheat. No manufacturer
asks or expects to be guaranteed immunity
from labor troubles before lie puts in new
machinery: he knows, in fact, that any
guarantee would simply be useless. _ In
demanding such a guarantee from the unions
before starting shipbuilding the Common-
wealth Government was demanding some-
thing which some Ministers at any rate
knew they would not get; and they relied
upon that refusal to damn the unions as
disloyalists. In plain words, these A in-the-
War Ministers are quite satisfied that the
wheat should stay in Australia, even if the
Allies are starved into submission, so long
as the unions are sufficiently damned. It
is time the daily papers refused to be a
party to this conspiracy. They could knock
the bottom out of it inside a week if they
plainly intimated that they are concerned
more about feeding the Allies and saving
civilisation than in feeding a grudge against
local unions and saving the face of one or
two vindictive politicians.
.Tudoed by the fine levied on Admiral Poore
for having in an isolated county-house sup-
plies in the cupboard that would look ordi-
nary in an Australian home a few miles
from a railway, food-hoarding in England is
now so severely interpreted that the only
way in which a family can safely feed itself
is to run out to the shop and buy what is
wanted for each meal. The bitterness of the
deer-park must be felt at last at John
Bull’s table. Had the nation been forced
to maintain itself in time of peace on home-
grown products, the land question would
have been settled long ago, and the produc-
tiveness of the country made so great that
the submarine would have been a jest. On
the other hand, it is very questionable
whether the great overseas trade in food is
good for the peoples who produce it. for
everywhere in new countries that trade
has the development of industrj.
t 'loseness to the soil seems necessary to keep
man at his best; and the person who drinks
milk from Switzerland and eats buttei tiom
Denmark, fish from Newfoundland, mutton
from Australia and sugar from South America
Ims lost touch with the realities. And the pri-
son who supplies him is only a degree better.
The carrying trade of the world may be a
great thing to possess; but the less distance
life's necessities require to be carried the
bettter for everybody.
Australia lias been smitten hard now in
its rabbit. That animal has gone to join the
surplus wheat. In each case we relied on
selling the surplus to the British Govern-
ment. Bull to take delivery here in his own
ships. Now he has intimated pretty clearly
that he can’t spare the ships for such long-
distance carrying. This, it is estimated, will
throw 10,000 or 12,000 men out ot work, per-
haps more - it will badly damage the ireezing
industry - and about 22,000,000 rabbits and
hares which used to bring in much money
will have to be pursued at great expense
else they will eat the country out of house
and home. The rabbit difficulty, in its small
way, is worse than the wheat problem. The
wheat at the worst can be burnt to make a
Roman holiday, and the ash may serve as a
kind of fertiliser, but bunny won’t stand
still to be lighted.
The glad news is to hand that during the
week ended January 20 1,086,851 bags of
wheat were brought to country railway
stations in N. S. Wales, and a trifle of
205.202 bags were got away. This left over
11,800,000 bags (close on 9,000,000 of it a
full year old) doing the dry-rot act in the
country and hoping for the best. But all is
not lost. The Hughes Government states
that no wooden ships—the kind that can be
built quickly—will be constructed, but in a
short time—how short no one knows —the
keels of certain steel vessels will be laid
down, and in two of these cases “prelimin-
aries are well advanced.” Unhappily all the
preliminaries on earth won’t carry one bushel
of grain. Preliminaries don’t float.
From an old chief: —
Nearly 30 years ago Edward Gillon, then editor of
the Post in Wellington (M.L.), acquired a new re-
porter who had drifted into the inky way through
the hamlets ,of Hawke’s Bay. He was a long, raw
youth decorated with a crop of flaming red hair
and possessed of a confidence that was sublime.
Before long Gillon turned him on to Parliament and
in five minutes or so the young man had a news
scoop which made the Windy Isles rock. He got
possession of a report furnished by Colonel Fox on
the local defences while the document was in its
confidential stage, and the publication started a
violent rumpus whose sole result was to advertise
Gilion’s recruit. The recruit’s name was E. D.
Hoben, and he died this week after a sorrowful ill-
ness at Melbourne. Hoben left the Post in the long
ago to join Sydney Telegraph, but soon went over
to the Fairfaxes, and was something or other on the
Mail for a dozen years or so. Then he drifted back
to Maoriland with a young, motherless family, had
exciting experiences on the AVellington Times, experi-
mented with country journalism for a while, had an
adventure in matrimony and came again to Australia
a few months ago to join the Melbourne Herald.
He was then 54 and a broken man. Getting that
Fox report seemed a great achievement at the time.
But it was the worst thing that could have hap-
pened to Hoben. He never got over it nor con-
quered an impulse to stand up and make a speech.
He was one of the promoters and first secretary of
the Maoriland Rugby Union.
Died this week, John McLaughlin, one of
the best known of Sydney solicitors. He had
been in poor health for months, and the
death of a brilliant son in action was the
last straw. John McLaughlin got often into
the public eye—years ago as a politician;
later, after an illness, as plaintiff in an
action which he brought against Sydney
Telegraph and other cos. for registering
transfers of shares of his while he was not
attending to his own affairs. On his re-
covery he carried the action through court
after court and won, achieving a judgment
which no company secretary is likely to ever
forget.
There was a curious study in the psycho-
logy of crowds on the Semaphore (S.A.)
beach on the last holiday. 'The crowd was
surrounding a mild sort of Wild West Show
run by a person of great respectability and
the ancient name of Smith. Events hap-
pened rapidly in this order: (1) A small
girl tried to butt in under the canvas, was
pushed out again, bleeding slightly from the
forehead, and raised a yell. (2) An elderly,
excitable and eloquent stranger addressed
the crowd on the proposition that to stab small
girls is Hunnish and intolerable. (3) The
crowd pulled down the tent and wrecked
the show. (4) Smith in his turn made a
tearful speech to the effect that the girl had
got her face scratched in being quite law-
fully turned back by a woman usher, that
he had been unaware of the matter unai
taken by the storm, and that he and his
large young family (produced) were now
ruined. (5) The crowd changed its alleged
mind again, and sent round the hat—not for
the kid, but for the Smith family.
Died at Melbourne, in his 36th year, Pri-
vate Francis C. Mason, second son of the
one-time Victorian Speaker. A chill caught
in camp shortly after lie had enlisted, and
followed by a more serious trouble, was the
cause of death. Before becoming a private
Mason was a clerk in the Leg. Ass. A bro-
ther is a major with a D.S.O.
McGirr, Labor M.L.A., on the N.S.W.
censure motion
He was against the motion because he was confi-
dent it was just what the Leader of the Government
wanted. He knew this, because he had sat behind
the Premier. But, being a member of the party, he
would vote for it.
And there you have another fine advertise-
ment for the honesty of politics under the
party system.
The State War Councils are doing their
bit in the matter of repatriation, at any rate.
In 1916 Parliament handed them £250,000 to
go on with, and this is how the cash went up
to June 30, T 7: —
Gifts. Loans.
N. S. Wales .. ..£11,694 £17,698

Auditor-General Israel says the Queensland
accounts were kept in a most unsatisfactory
manner, quantities of private contributions
to the fund being omitted, while irregulari-
ties and illegal disposals of grants have been
reported in all the States. Furthermore,
large numbers of instalments of loan repay-
ments are in arrear, Victoria having achieved
the feat of collecting only 14 per cent, of
repayments due. But auditors make no
allowance for what may happen when one is
winning a war or eating dirt or working a
point or whatever you like to call it.
“Square Deal”: S. Australia takes a pride
in the care it gives to its sick and afflicted;
and for that reason the Defence Depart-
ment’s neglect of its obligations with regard
to shell-shock and other mental cases among
S. Australian returned soldiers is provoking
the bitterest resentment. With the excep-
tion of the ordinary accommodation at the
Parkside Lunatic Asylum, absolutely no
provision is made in the State for the treat-
ment of these most unfortunate of our sol-
diers. Slight cases may be treated at one
or other of the Military Hospitals for a time,
but are usually discharged long before they
are cured, with the result that they wander
about as they like, and no attempt is made
to train their faculties and gradually win
them back to normal. Bad cases are sent to
the asylum, where they are on exactly the
same footing as the other inmates. There
are about half a dozen “mentals” who go
regularly to the Cheer-Up Hut. Their pre-
sence is very bad for the “nerve-y” men who
go there, and they are often a considerable
embarrassment to the workers. Attention
lias been again and again called to the need
for a proper Home, but so far no announce-
ment has been made of any such institution
being under consideration even. Most of
these men could be so easily restored by the
right surroundings that it is outrageous
that they should be allowed to drift about
the streets uncared for and unguarded.
“N’importe”: Having brought the Aus-
tralian pastoralists to heel in the Federal
Arbitration Court and secured a liberal
award, the A.W.U. is after the scalp of the
cockies in the N. S. Wales State Court.
Claims have been filed, and the opening
skirmishes took place just before Christmas.
A 48-hour week is asked for workers in the
agricultural, horticultural, viticultural and
dairying industries, and wages at various
rates up to £4 per week and keep; also that
no infants under 14 be employed. While the
Federal award applies only to those station-
owners who were big enough to be “cited”
before the Federal Court, the State award
when made will apply to every cocky employ-
ing labor, no matter how small his holding
Maybe £4 and keep for 48 hours’ toil is a
fair thing; but as cocky has to send his stuff
away to compete with people who don’t work
on those lines, there seems to be a tough
time ahead for somebody.
“Fore-Stay”: While Australia is still
chinwagging as to how, when |md where, a
start is to be made at shipbuilding, the prin-
cipal Commonwealth ports-are populated by
vessels constructed since the war started.
The four-, five- and even six-masted schoon-
ers now familiar in Australian harbors are
nearly all new ; also they are floating gold
mines for the strangers who own them. One
Canadian syndicate alone has turned out 12
large schooners in the last few months, and
the profits from these vessels repay the capi-
tal cost in two or three trips. One Yankee
skipper visiting Sydney rec ntly showed me
that his “dinghy” was returning his owners
£24,000 a year.

If “The Easiest Way,” produced at Mel-
bourne Royal last Saturday, were a little
less monotonous in tone, the dialogue, which
is only sometimes excessive and tedious,
would keep it entertaining. The simple story
is cheap and false, but the talk mostly has a
ring of truth, and where it touches the eter-
nal question of Sex against Sex it is very
forcible. Instance the indignation of the
fair-dealing profligate on discovering that his
mistress has made him appear dishonorable
to a Man —another Man! And the inability
of the two ladies of easy virtue to think it
possible that a man could have any feeling
but jealousy in warning another man against
marrying a pretty girl. Of the four charac-
ters in the play (two others being only
make-weights) the bloated capitalist is suffi-
ciently real, and the incidental Elfie, who
considers herself as a mere business proposi-
tion, is an excellent photograph of a type.
It is, of course, easy for a smart girl with
a hard voice to naturalise such parts; but
Miss Norma Mitchell is a conspicuous
success. Frank
Harvey does well
as the usually
well - conducted
“protector,” pre-
sented as a bearish
person when the
sympathy of the
audience is most
ea mostly desi red
for the soiled
heroine, but really
a decent sort of
giddy bachelor who
doesn’t take women
seriously, and is
not likely to
change hi s views
after his experi-
ences with Laura.
She is a somewhat
vixenish Camille,
without the con-
sumptive cough.
From first to last
the character is
unconvincing ;
nevertheless Muriel
Starr, despite her
weakening voice,
gets some good
theatrical effects
out of it, especially
when she assures
The Panto., Melbourne

The Widow Twankey
(Bert Bailey).
her generous
friend that she hates him. The part, how-
ever, gets too much for her at the finish.
Kimball, as the noble journalist, gets in his
one touch of nature just before the end, when
he turns suddenly cynical and cold-hearted,
and calls Maggie Moore in to see her mis-
tress funk the ordeal of shooting herself.
Atholwood gives a capital stage-character
study of an angelic, Dickensesque old battler,
and three scenes by Upward, the first a
rather ultra-picturesque landscape, are far
more effective than the orchestra that has at
least a couple of long, long waits to fill in.

“Whittington” continues to happen eight
times a week at Melbourne Majesty’s, and
•‘Aladdin” occurs the same number of times
at the King’s. Thusfar there is no threat of
withdrawal in either case, nor even a hint of
Last Nights.

At Melbourne Princess’s the sun of melo-
drama has set for a while, and Australian
comic opera is about to shine. “The Rajah
of Shivapore,” by Alfred Hill and David
Souter, will get a chance on Saturday.
Because it is a purely local production “The
Rajah” will be interesting to every good Aus-
tralian, and inasmuch as it has received its
baptism of praise on the other side of the
Murray, the show should attract those others
who have no national sentiment to speak of.
The Puller management promises a liberal
supply of orchestra, chorus and ballet, whilst
prices remain popular as usual.

Melbourne seems to have made up its mind
that “Winnie Brooke,” at the Tivoli, is a
particularly nice thing in widows. Her im-
personations of Ada Reeve in vaudeville
would make her popular if she had nothing
else to do, but, as a matter of fact, she
does a lot of other things in a w T ay which
Ada Reeve must have taught her. Finally
she leaves the audience in doubt as to
whether it saw Ada impersonating Winnie
or Winnie impersonating Ada. The identi-
ties get mixed.
In “The Spirit of Romance” at Iloyt’s
Melbourne house this week, Vivian Martin
is a rest cure to a millionaire debilitated by
dollars. Vivian is a great success in the
part. She belongs to the demure class of
flappers who act on men like a Sunday even-
ing in Geelong. The Artcraft feature,
“Down ,to Earth,” gets all its dynamic
energy from Douglas Fairbanks. That
absurd young man sneaks into an hypochon-
driacs’ retreat and proceeds to restore the
apparently dead with judicious shocks to
their nervous systems.
❖* * *
Douglas Fairbanks was also let loose for
the first half of this week at Melbourne
Britannia, where he revived a previous phase
of his excitable existence called “Manhattan
Madness.” To-day Irene Hunt is showing
the awful possibilities of female perfection
in tiie Triangle attraction, "The Stainless
Barrier.” The Melba commenced this week
with Theda Bara in “The Darling of Paris,”
which has been adapted from incidents in
“The Hunchback of Notre Dame.” Theda
appeared as Esmeralda, and repeated her old
trick of using the dove as a spiritual camou-
flage for the serpent. Miss Bara will be
succeeded to-day by Carlyle Blackwell in a
now World film entitled “The Burglar.”
Samuel Houston finishes his long pursuit
of Eliza Allen at Melbourne Auditorium to-
morrow. On Saturday “The Conqueror”
gives place to a Fox version of “Camille,”
in which Theda Bara provides the tubercu-
losis and tears.
The dainty little pseudo-Jap romance,
“The Willow Tree,” having got over its
teething troubles, is doing well at Sydney
Criterion. Kathlene Macdonell’s artistic
presentation of the lady who is “half a
woman and half a tree” is being rapturously
received by a repentant audience.
Little Maie Baird, the smiling dancer in
the freak dress, is one of the daintiest items
in “The Bing Boys Are Here,” a stupendous
show whose plot is as disconnected as a
Sydney telephone conversation. But if there
were more plot there would be less room
for the specialties; and the specialties all
glitter and tinkle beautifully, whereas a plot
very often only thuds. Business is so good
that Geo. Matheson nightly stands at the
back of the circle wishing that Sydney
Majesty’s could eat up as big a crowd as the
sister house in Melbourne, which can swal-
low 500 more.
“Turn to the Right” will be turned to the
right-about at Sydney Palace after Friday
night’s performance. “Peg o’ My Heart”
starts a brief revival on the following even-
ing.
* * *
Sydney Tivoli loads its grip afresh with
“Samples,” a London revue success.
Comedian Phil Smith leads, and Marie
Eaton, Frank Greene, Celia Ghiloni and
Hugh Huntley are more or less implicated.
This happens on Saturday. Nellie Leach, of
Sydney, and Neiman and Kennedy, the ram-
shackle tramp specialists, will also fall into
the show somewhere.

The latest official communique from Field-
Marshal Fuller states that on the Grand

The most charming film-story of the week
in Sydney is “Every Girl’s Dream,” a deli-
cate fairy-tale worked out in a picturesque
Dutch background. June Caprice is the
Gretchen who marries a real live Prince who
doesn’t have to walk with an eye over each
shoulder lest his faithful retainers spit his
heart with their newly-sharpened swords.
This is at the Empress. At the Lyric Bess
Shellgrove (Ethel Bashford) is wrongfully
convicted of theft and transported for “The
Term of Her Natural Life.” On arrival in
Australia she gets
a fine opportunity
of proving that she
still prizes honor
and virtue above
all, and does a dash
to the bush, where
she is rescued by
.Tack Warren (J.
F. Garvin) —and
you know the rest.
A bustling, stirring
story. The Crystal
Palace is again un-
fortunate in its
feature. “The
Stainless Barrier”
is the sort of film
one wants to for-
get in a hurry. In
contrast are the
breezy absurdities
of “D own to
Earth,” the story
of a. health cure,
with Douglas Fair-
banks as physician-
in-chief, which is

The long picture called “Parentage” has
stopped asking its “big. vital questions” at
Sydney Royal. On Saturday the J.C.W. pic-
ture-house flicks on “The Conqueror,” a
William Fox product which stars William
Far nu in.
A speechless pantomime has been running
on the screen at Adelaide Royal. The clever
producer can get all sorts of effects, of dis-
tance and of vast numbers, that are denied
to the stage. On the other hand, the jokes
about beer and mother-in-law, the general
appeal to the baldhead in the stalls, are
mercifully absent. The result is essentially
a show for the kiddies, and they have
greatly favored it. Right on the top of it
comes another Beanstalk pantomime at the
Tivoli —the ordinary kind this time, with
Mabel Morgan as principal boy, Harry Far-
row as Dame, and a lot of clever and shapely
people in support. At the Majestic Ruth
Budd is still the star turn, her work on the
rings, brilliant in
itself, getting a lot
of add e d value
thro u g li being
cleverly stage-man-
aged. At Wonder-
graph Marguerite
Clark is starred in
a strange, Ameri-
canised perversion
of dear old “Ama-
zons” without the
humor. Bu t the
most striking pic-
ture in sight is the

truth about the remarkable man.

Bowen, up near Townsville, is a peaceful
•spot with plenty of time on its hands. A
cow asleep in the afternoon is revolutionary
by comparison, and is conspiring to upset
the throne. Yet there is a Federal police-
man trampling down the street grass at
Bowen, and if somebody maddened him by-
raising social and political and religious dis-
sension outside bis house when lie was asleep
he would have to run the criminal in, for
he couldn’t sink to the ignominy of asking
the mere State cop for protection. Then il
the disturber had good legal advice the
Federal bobby might learn quite a lot about
his status. The affair might end by 7 a de-
mand for heavy damages for illegal arrest,
and the case mieiit even be dragged in the
slow procession of time to the Privy 7 Coun-
cil. It would be quite unlike Hughes 1!
there wasn’t a hole in his hurried appoint-
ments—a hole larsre enough to throw an
elephant through.
“Camelero” : Born in Russia and educated
in Germany and France, Frank Matzonas set
out to see the world just before Berlin Bill
lifted the lid of Sheol. After doing U.S.A.
and the South Seas, lie drifted to Sydney,,
and considering it a good country to fight for
he joined a Light Horse unit leaving for
Egypt. Later on, he transferred to the
Camels, and after two years’ campaigning
a German machine-gunner rang down the
curtain on him at BeCrslieba. The same
machine-gunner also killed Tom Stewart,
known almost wherever there’s a call for
“Tar 1” in the backblocks of Queensland and
New South.
An old hand analyses the Commonwealth
Government’s failure as a Win-the-War
trader: —
This week we could not buy more than 21b. of
sugar in our town. Now, in 17 years of selling
sugar—-with the exception of a few weeks while
Irvine was making his name settling the Vic. rail-
way strike —I never knew what shortage meant in
the sugar department. The price fluctuated a bit,
perhaps, but there was always sugar to sell. This
•illustrates the difference between State and private-
trading. The private trader owns an abstract thing
the State can’t understand —business reputation. He
prides himself on being always able to “deliver the
goods,” and he goes to much trouble and expense
(which he passes on, of course) to fulfil that obliga-
tion. Tlie State doesn’t get down to this abstraction.
If it is in difficulties about getting sugar or cornsaeks
or ships—well, its customers have just got to jolly
well wait. Now the price of a thing is not half such a
vital point as the yelpers after fixed-price would
have us believe. Most folk would much rather have
plenty sugar at 4d. a pound than no sugar
at all at 31d. —a woman can’t make jam out of
gratitude to a grandmotherly legislature. In tin-
first sugar shortage, when Hughes dabbled in
C.S.R. affairs in 1915, I was repeatedly offered os.
a bag on my regular price to induce me to let go
the sugar I was holding, and the majority of people
would gladly do it now, even for second-rate Java
piebald crystals.
THE EASIEST WAY.
For love did giddy Laura yearn
E’en when a pleasant broker.
With hundred-dollar bills to burn,
As concubine bespoke her.
A life of ease and smooth content
The ri<h “friend” freely gave her,
Till fate—ah me! —unkindly sent
A sweetheart pure to save her.
To rectify her moral twist
Fate sent a Noble Journalist.
She shook her grey “protector’s” hand,
So open and forgiving,
And gave the gent to understand
She meant to earn her living
Upon the stage, where for a year
Her charms had been distracting,
Ere yet Temptation pinched her ear
And made her sick of acting.
The broker, calm and cool, but trist.
Left Laura to the Journalist.
Brave oaths of fealty they swore,
Those lovers twain converted;
She vowed she would trangress no more,
And he his trust asserted.
She went to town to look for work,
Her lode-star eyes a-shining;
Young John departed, with a smirk,
To make a pile at mining.
With swelling chest and clenched fist
Went forth that Noble Journalist.
Poor Laura seeking for a job—
An actress out of collar —
Soon sobbed the old dramatic sob
And blewed her bottom dollar.
Her jewels went, her gowns of silk;
Meanwhile her rich adorer
Thought—“ Being good on bread and milk
Is not much fun for Laura.”
And then the Serpent slyly hissed:
“Deuce take your Noble Journalist!”
There came a festive, gilded “tart,”
A sinful household treasure,
Who harrowed Laura’s aching heart
With talk of ease and pleasure;
She brought the broker to the room,
And he was all politeness;
Where poverty had shed its gloom
His money scattered brightness.
But, though her lips again were kissed,
She did not tell the Journalist.
Then he came back, a millionaire,
Or something very like it,
Who’d looked for gold in black despair,
And somehow chanced to strike it;
Came back, with wedded-bliss in view,
To bless his benefactress.
Sweet Laura still, for all he knew,
Was but an artless actress.
(She kept the facts and hid the gist
From that confiding Journalist.)
Fate, frowning on Miss Laura’s guile,
From grief did-not exempt her;
John heard of her deception vile,
And then he met the Tempter,
Who said that loose, illicit loves
(Though matters for deploring)
Are good enough for soiled doves—*
But no dove’s worth adoring.
Thus spake the man of 46:
“The love game is the same as whist—
Each player trumps the other’s tricks.”
Thus spake the world-wide moralist
Unto the rich-quick Journalist.
And Laura saw, to her dismay,
That girls may be too clever.
The good young man and broker grey,
With w’hom she chose the easy way,
Had chuckt her now forever.
The greenhorn and the cynic wise,
Each having kissed and trusted
The charmer who had told them lies,
Were each in turn disgusted.
Ah, girls! fool whoso else you list,
But play fair with a Journalist.


All are Dumb when
Beauty Pleads.
The summer is here. The Australian
climate is a severe one. Surfing, motoring, picnick-
ing will absorb much of your time. Be prepared for
the burning sun and a dry, tender and chapped skin.
It is the weather which affects your skin. If you
allow it to remain lifeless and inactive you cannot
have that rich velvety skin with a radiant color that
comes and goes.
Do not say it is useless to try to change the skin
itself. It changes every day in spite of you ; as old
skin dies new skin forms to take its place. Ihis new
skin will be just what you make it: by attention
you can have that charm of “A skin everyone envies.”
Think how many years older your face looks than
skin that is unexposed. Yet the world judges you by
your face, and that criticism is going to be more
severe through the wastage of manhood by war.
How unfair to yourself, then, not to counteract the
ill effects of dust, dirt, wind and weather, and to
have the clear, youthful, healthy and attractive skin
that is rightfully yours.
It is essential to free your skin of those tiny old
dead particles, cleanse the pores of unseen grime, and
hr in" the blood to the surface and stimulate the small
muscular fibres. It is no use doing it for a couple
of days, then neglecting it. If you persevere the
charm will come to stay. Treat your skin properly
and persistently, and you will reap a big reward.

When the Argus supports a strike it cer-
tainly goes the entire hog. The other day
rhe old paper published a letter from “A
Doctor’s Wife” in reference to the dispute
between the Victorian friendly societies and
the lodge doctors, who are striking for in-
creased pay, which contained this impressive
sentence:—
If the doctors are spineless enough to attend
patients after the threatening attitude of the ter-
rorists, one can only hope that the treatment will
he as they deserve.
Of course, ordinarily the Argus would not
dream of printing an incitement to sabotage,
because machinery and such-like proputty is
sacred ; but when it comes to messing about
with human lives that merely belong to the
—ah —lowah ordalis, the Argus does not
frown out a suggestion that, if they are not
granted the additional tuppence, or what-
ever the amount is, the doctors should prac-
tise a particularly horrible form of sabotage.
“Digger” : During one of the closing bat-
tles of the Somme, when we were held up
by mud and Fritz’s machine-guns, we were
greatly heartened by the sight of a tank
floundering to our rescue, with the inspirit-
ing legend on its side: “The Bing Boys are
Here.” Blucher was not more welcome to
Wellington than were the Bing Boys to us
that day. Months later, when going down
to billets, I saw the same tank lying smashed
up by the side of the Pozieres-rpad. Along-
side were seven graves, the resting-places of
the crew. The tank had been knocked out
by a direct hit from a shell and the crew
were burnt to death. They were buried
alongside their fortress, and their battle-cry
was their epitaph.
“Bill Bowyang”: In the recent fighting
around Beersheba and Gaza, Abdul settled
the name as a clean fighter which
he earned on Gallipoli. He repeatedly bombed
and fired on hospitals and stretcher
bearers, and the other day he sniped
wounded who were crawling to the rear. In
one part, of the line the Scotties sent us word
not to take prisoners, as Jacko was using
reversed bullets, i.e., the lead was turned so
that the blunt end entered its human
target. In most cases the wounds were
ghastly, and one-half of those who have been
sent to hospital in Cairo will return to Aus-
tralia. Copper machine-bullets accounted
for many deaths before hospitals were even
reached. Billjim (I will say it, even if he
is my mate) is the most chivalrous, the most
tolerant, enemy that ever God raised on two
legs; but at this moment he is the maddest
thing in Palestine, and God help the Turk
who comes our way!
Just as it comes from John B. Simpson :
We had just occupied the possy and were being
sniped by Turks, who were lying- about everywhere.
Good old Billy and I were together as usual. II e
were also thirsty—as usual. As we loaded and
fired, we talked of the bet we had made in Cairo
three weeks before —the loser would shave first.
Constant trekking had compelled us to give our
razors a rest for three weeks, and we were shocking-
sights. Suddenly my mate noticed two chaps get to
the cookhouse and back again. “I’m going to have
a cut at it, Doc.,” he said. “Those blokes were
getting water.” I warned him it was risky, but he
jumped out and ran down safely. 1 saw him fill his
own bottle and mine. Then he started back and
raced to within ten yards of our possy. Two bounds
from home they dropped him. I jumped out and
pulled him in. He had a wound through the side
of the head and the blood was slowly pouring out.
He did not cry out, but grinned his old cheerful
grin (I see him now as I write) and said: “Send
some of my things home, Doc., old man. My address
is in my pocket-book.” He waited a minute or so ;
then, looking up with his scrubby-bearded chin
almost touching mine, he added, “Doc, I win—you’ll
have that shave first.” A minute more and he was
dead. I buried him there and left his bandolier and
rifle over his grave.
* * » *
“Camelero” (from Palestine) : While our
fellows in France have been living in puddles
our wounded here have been suffering the
tortures of the damned from thirst. Natu-
rally since our fighting has been in open
order, mostly mounted, it has taken hours to
collect the casualties. And God knows what
water is to a man suffering the agonies of
torn flesh! One of the toughest cases of
hard luck happened in our little lot. A
trooper was badly wounded and his horse
shot dead under him. Unable to move he lay
beside the carcase and waited for the ambu-
lance that did not come. His water-bottle
was on the saddle—the side of the saddle
that was underneath. He could not drag
himself round the horse; but with his
unwounded hand he began slowly scratching
a hole under it, and at last, when just about
done, his fingers touched the bottle. That
gave him hope: he burrowed a chamber and
liberated it —and then found that in the poor
beast’s struggles the cork had been released !
That was the end of the section for him, he
thought. But it wasn’t. At midnight an
English patrol heard his moans, brought him
in to a dressing-station, and he was taken
off to Cairo yesterday.

One wild night last week five Sydney
policemen were killing time inside a Syd-
ney house while the lunatic they had called
for was sitting on the roof in torrents of
rain. He had his pockets full of brick, and
bowled down repeatedly to the miserable
Hops, who wanted to see him back to the
asylum, that he would leap into the street
and provide them with an untidy inquest if
they crawled up to take him. After haggling
INVIDIOUS.
ALICE: “Billy give him to me because he was the ugliest dog in the world.”
ERNESTINE: “How like Billy!”
for a time they tossed him a waterproof, and
he put it on and sat watchfully on the
streaming slates. The cyclone howled and
the heavy rain poured down hour after hour;
and at dawn a soggy and sobered lunatic
came off tamely, had breakfast and went
thankfully to Dottyville.
“Firefly”: At the end of last year a
woman arrived in Darwin with two children,
and another, a baby boy, arrived soon after-
wards in the Government Hospital. The
mother was a widow. Her husband had just

MISS DE SCRATCH : “I hear old Miss Wallflower is engaged at last. Who is the fortunate
man?”

been killed at the war, and she could not
provide for the legacy he had left his coun-
try. The woman sought work in Darwin,
and, noticing that the town was full of
childless wives with highly-paid husbands,
she offered her baby for adoption, and adver-
tised it. But that particular class of pre-
sent did not appeal to that particular class
of woman; so a good, healthy Australian
baby boy became a superfluous thing in a
country of less than 2000 white inhabitants
to more than 300,000 sq. miles. Finally a
Chinaman, who has a lot more white in his
composition than yellow, offered to adopt the
baby—and got him! The foster-father (a
single man) insisted on having a proper
deed of adoption drawn up and registered.
The new owner of the baby to his credit
found a foster mother of the kiddie’s own
color, and on Christmas Eve, when
he was three weeks old, the transfer
was legally effected. “By cripes!” said
old Billimuk of Bierli, “ ’posem white
feller no more wantem baby, what for
gibit alonga Chinaman? Gibit alonga my
gin, him gottem plenty milk, my country
gottem plenty tucker, that,, feller belongin’
to ’Tralia, ain’t it? What for gibit China-
man?”
“N’importe”: Billjim’s superstition about
lighting; three men’s fags with tb» one match
is not peculiar to the Aussie troops. Pat
Macgill in “The Brown Brethren” reports
it in connection with the London Irish :
“The superstition is a modern one,” says Flanagan,
blowing the smoke of a cigarette through his nos-
trils. “Invented, I suppose, by Bryant and May’s to
increase the output of matches.”
McGill kills his third man as he hops over,
immediately after the smoke-o. It reads
like an actual happening, too.
* * * *
Anyhow, no one can reasonably say that
the Newcastle (N.S.W.) Children’s Court
should be economised out of its job because
it has nothing to do. According, to the
iccal police inspector, “Eighty per cent, of
the crimes of the district during the past
few months have been committed by chil-
dren.” On one recent day 23 youngsters
faced, the magistrate—mostly on breaking,
entering and stealing charges—and that was
reckoned typical of every weekly court day.
Seemingly the immature brigand of Coalo-
polis quite understands the value of “organi-
sation” ; in almost every suburb he has
formed himself into a “society” of from four
to 30 members, elected a secretary and
treasurer, and christened himself the Black
Hand, or some such fearsome monster. The
Court dealt with 364 cases last year; and
(he only explanation local moralists can find
for the epidemic is the tired old one of “the
evil example of the moving pictures.” It is
much more likely to be the demoralising in-
fluence of coal. Even a politician doesn’t
»eem able to touch the substance without
getting his hands soiled.

“F.N.T.”: The N. S. Wales Wine Ass.
doesn’t approve of The Bulletin sugges-
tion, put forward also by Commonwealth
Analyst Wilkinson on the same day, that
the foreign names port, sherry and so on,
as applied to Australian wines, should be
abolished. These names, the growers de-
clare, “have become generic; and when
people ask for sherry, port and other classes
they do not expect the product of France,
Spain, Italy or Portugal.” P’raps not; but
that doesn’t alter the fact that when I want
a glass of the very best claret obtainable in
Australia, I have to soecify a certain brand
of Australian wine. Otherwise I may be
served with a tiny glass of inferior, imported
wine at a higher price.
DOGS AND THE MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
v • S ,' l Maurice Abbott Anderson and Lady Anderson
jmed a taxi-cab to take them to Molesworth and
over GO miles, at a cost of £lO. The object
ot this journey was to convey the remains of a
tavonte pug dog- for interment in a 'dogs’ cemeterv.
Jhere is a dogs’ cemetery in London, but the place
was too crowded, and the calm and quiet of the
country were preferable. The corpse was encased in
a leaden casket, placed in a white wood coffin. The
long journey involved the consumption of much
petrol, and the magistrates showed their disapproval
of the whole business by fining the chauffeur £5O.
Lady Anderson paid the money, but under protest.”
A man of “blue” or baser blood
Gets killed whilst danger scorning;
Mates bury him in Flanders mud,
But have no time for mourning-.
No leaden case for his remains,
Enclosed in coffin costly—
Just earth to earth, where weeping rains
And chill winds blow across the plains.
Thus men are buried mostly.
He died to keep Old England free
And fearless as aforetime,
That rich folks, guarded by the sea,
May live at home in war-time ;
lie lived with vermin, fleas and bugs,
Whilst wasters, young or hoary,
Sat nursing sick and sorry pugs,
And wrapped the dogs in cosy rugs,
And talked of England’s glory.
If one dear doggie dies, alas!
The parlormaids and footmen
Treat Fido’s flesh as finer grass
Than that of soldier brute-men:
Of bitter cups and meagre fare
Let heroes be the tasters.
God save the Right! God save the Fair!
God help the soldiers over there!
But, O God, damn the wasters!

A CLASSICAL MASTER’S LETTER to CLEMENTS TONIC
Mr. G. A. Lundie, M.A., formerly Assistant-Headmaster High School, Palmerston North, N.Z, writes of this Medicine
And recommends it to all professional people, especi-
ally to teachers in the Educational service of Aus-
tralia, who suffer from weak nerves, insomnia or
brain fag.

There are hundreds of teachers of both sexes employed in
the N.S.W. Educational Service to-day who suffer from weak
nerves or acute nervousness, through continuous nerve strain in
teaching and study, who never really enjoy good health. It is
as much the worry of keeping their schools up to the educa-
tional standard as the work which accounts for their feeling of
general ill-health. They should keep Clements Tonic on hand
as a “stand-by” medicine, feeling certain that in its possession
they will have a sweet soother of the nerves, a promoter of
keen appetite, and a general healer of the rundown and over-
wrought system. It makes weak people well and strong people
stronger. Get it to-day.

A picturesque incident didn’t happen

had it that an aged craft which had been
tied for years to the river bank broke loose
and fled headlong down the river. Its sole
human contents were an ancient sea-captain
aged 84, and his chances as he vanished into
the storm were voted hopeless: The vessel
didn’t become a complete wreck, after all.

“Machete” ; “Joyce’s” yarn of the Solomon
Island medicine-man (B. 10/1/T8) recalls
the performances of members of the pro-
fession practising in New Guinea. They are
a very close corporation in those parts, and
their privileges are jealously guarded against
encroachments by missionaries and Govern-
ment M.O.’s —it’s just the same as the
B.M.A..’s attitude to the non-elect on our
side. One of them once cured the first
Bishop of N.G. of an attack of neuralgia.
Maclaren had been condemning the prac-
titioner for roguery and general unworthi-
ness, when the latter offered to cure him of the
pain of which he had complained. The antics
of the old tough during the treatment so
interested Maclaren that when challenged he
had to admit that the pain was gone. Then,

hundred niggers who were looking on, the

“Terrible! Horrible, in fact."
operator produced a long and loathly earth-
worm, which he swore he had just extracted
from the Bishon’s ear! Ever afterwards
that medicine-man kept the Papuan equiva-
lent of motor-cars, and his fame went lip
and down the land.
REASONABLE ENCOURAGEMENT.
DESPERATE YOUNG MAN: “If I were to kiss you, would you scream?"
SWEET LITTLE THING: “ N-no. Fright always makes me dumb.”
“Cherokee” goes down the Bay (nit!) :
The great, thing on these hot evenings in Melbourne
is to be one of as many sweltering thousands as can
pack on board the side-wheeler Hygeia, and embark
for a “pleasure” trip on that flat, wet expanse known
as Port Phillip Bay. In the absence of Mrs. Cherokee
I decided to take it on when the Vic. Railways
Institute ran its moonlight picnic, for which tickets
were sold on Port Mel-
bourne pier. 1 never
reached the steamer.
Large, thick men ran
amok and' went “over
the top” at the ticket
offices; women tore off
each other’s hats and
back hair; a plank fell
out of the pier and
dropped into the sea, and
so tight was the jamb
that mere lateral pres-
sure kept those above
the hole from following
the plank. People on
the steamer rushed to the
side next the pier to bar-
rack for the fighters, so
that the Vessel canted
until her inshore paddle-
box was level with the
string-piece. I prayed
that everyone would slide
off the deck, but the
passengers stuck like
flies to fly-paper, while
rampant women sprang
from pier to steamer
with small kids describ-
ing surprising parabolas
beside them. The police
stopped the sale of
tickets, and the fight
moved nearer the steamer.
At last she slid away, leaving a thousand surging
trippers behind. Melbourne has quaint ideas of
amusing itself.
“Tarago”: The new “depth bomb” that
has been designed to fall like a welcoming
bouquet on the shy U-boat makes a consider-
able stir. The other morning I w r atched
from near this English hospital a shore bat-
tery practising with these fireworks. The
course of the shell seemed similar to that of
the howitzer, and when it struck the water
it was almost perpendicular. Its entry was
followed in every case by a mild report like
that of a cracker; but there was no mistak-
ing the concussion, which sent a shiver
through 500 ft. of solid rock beneath me, and
heaved up the sea like a submarine volcano
in the neighborhood of the hit.
“Kei Viti” : Recently I went to a Fijian
meke given in aid of the Red Cross funds. A
number of highly-polished brown ladies sat
in a row with a backing of highly-polished
and hefty bucks, and sang interminable and
quite irrelevant songs in perfect time and
harmony, to the accompani-
ment of a lalli, the hollow
log beaten with sticks which
is their chief musical instru-
ment. They were gorgeously
attired in wreaths and
tappa, and they smelt to
high Heaven of coeoanut oil
and warm Fijian. At inter-
vals a magnificent native
came forward and made a
few remarks in his own
language, such as: “When
Kitchener went down in the
North Sea his last message
to the Fijians was: ‘Help
England, and down with
Germany.’ ” Then he se-
lected a plump damsel from
the chorus, made her stand
up. and introduced her thus:
“This is a Red Cross nurse.
She received a medal from
the King for killing 10
wounded Germans.” Tre-
mendous applause from the
audience, and bashful retire-
ment of the supposed minis-
tering angel. Another was
brought forward: “This is a
Red Cross nurse who was
specially decorated by the
King. She had to nurse a
very great German general.
This is what he looked like
when she had finished with
him,” and he hobbled across
the stage with the help of a
stick, a dreadfully deformed
and misshapen specimen of
humanity. The audience
roared, and I came away
wondering whether they’d
think the Red Cross was
worth helping if they knesv
what it really is and does.
On February 1 Hobart citizens missed the
sound of the 1 o’clock gun which has been
fired at the Domain batterv for about half
a century to let them know whether the
clock was 10 minutes slow or only five. It
costs £75 a year to fire the gun, and last
year the Assembly, in one of its spasms of
economy, cut the amount down to £37, which
has all been blown away.
"Oheckaquo” : Prendergast, M.L.A., whom
no one would suspect of such an interest in
Art, recently instigated Premier Bowser
(equally guiltless of such suspicion) to make
inquiries for a picture of early Melbourne,
drawn by one Jackson in 1841. The Vic.
Government bought it in 1882 for £4OO, and
in 1892 lent it to the promoters of the old
Cyclorama on Eastern Hill. Then it van-
ished from public ken. A ’tec. was put on
the job, and the work of art was found,
according to Bowser’s information, in a
heap of debris at the Exhibition, where the
State Parliament has its murmurous hive.
When the discovery got press publicity,
’Enery Weedon, chairman of the Exhibition
trustees, rose in his frock-coated wrath to
protest that the drawing wasn’t among
debris. It was perfectly secure, having been
locked in a safe for 26- years. (This is
just what you’d expect of Weedon and his
committee. Hang Art! It is safer under
lock and key!) The drawing, which is 15ft.
long by 2ft. wide, is in black-and-white,
one in the Cyclorama being a copy. The
artist drew it sitting in a large barrel on
the site of Scots’ Church, taking out a stave
at a time as he required a fresh section of
landscape.
EXPECTING THE IMPOSSIBLE.
M AUD: “Oh, my show didn't go so badly.
The audience didn't hiss, anyway."
PEGGY: “Well, dear, they couldn't yawn and
hiss at the same time, could they ?”

He was a man of thirty-two,
And tall and elegant was he,
With quiet ways, but bold to woo,
Just as Prince Charming ought to be.
She met him, and her air was cold :
She heard him, and seemed not to heed;
The little tale he might unfold
Was very wearisome indeed,
lie was not rude in any way,
Yet artfully she did contrive
Throughout a long, delightful day
To scarce admit he was alive.
He left her not a whit concerned,
And gave no thought to her at all;
She to her simple life returned,
And said she liked them slim and tall.
She told herself she loved his hair,
She wondered who would be his wife,
His e.ves remembered year by year,
And dreamed about him all her life.

The moon was as thin as the shining edge
Of an ancient and very well-worn half-crown,
As 1 saw her rise through the prickly hedge
When the meek little evening came trembling
down.
’Twas a chill little evening that seemed too young
After all the rain that the clouds hail flung.
Hut the clouds had gone and the sky was blue ;
And right on the top of a ruffianly tree
A little white star, like a fairy’s shoe,
Seemed merrily dancing a jig to me ;
While the moon, like a shaving of very white pine,
Couldn’t And enough darkness to really shine.
My hand in my pocket forlorn and deep,
I turned all the cash that I happened to find—
One threepenny-bit that had gone to sleep
With a penny the world had left behind —-
And the little star laughed for the thing lie knew,
And wished me the luck of my dream come true.
And it came like a shot. Oh, young romance
That flutters when evenings have moons to wear.
And the small stars wink with their toes that dance
On fifty millions of leagues of air!
For the bell rang out with its call to me —
And we didn’t have hash that night for tea !

Peter Simonoff, who was lately appointed
Russian Consul-General for Australia, is 30
and a Bolshevik. Arriving in Australia six
years ago he toiled a while in Queensland,
then went round to Port Tine, and being
an "internationalist” naturally drifted on to
Broken Hill (N.S.W.), where he got a job
as a trucker. He used to be a clerk. Last
year he returned to Queensland as editor
of the Russian paper, The Worker’s Life,
which was lately very unwisely suppressed
by the Commonwealth Government. One
thing he reckons sure : “Russia is not going
to make a shameful Kaiser’s peace.” What,
lie seems to overlook is that Peter and Paul
can’t jointly resist the Kaiser by hitting one
another on the nose.
Samuel Taylor, who passed out lately at
96, was the oldest Anglican priest in Vic-
toria. He came to Australia from Dublin
nearly 70 years ago, and from 1853 till 1889
was stationed at Brighton, where he had
among his curates Dr. Green, who afterwards
bished at Armidale (N.S.W.) and Ballarat,
and Dr. Stretch, who still wears Anglican
gaiters at Newcastle.

Island (M.L.) writes: —-
Count von Luekner, the German sea-raider, now
doing penance for an indefinite period on Ripa
Island, Lyttelton Harbor, is perfectly delightful. I
travelled with him on the ferry-boat from Welling-
ton. He was beautifully uniformed, in a sweetly-
fitting tunic with a perceptible waist, and his man-
ners w r ere so distinguished, yet with a, soupcon of
sadness. He didn’t seem a bit to resent his capture.
Ilis aristocratic features wore only a gentle melan-
choly. Stories from other quarters credit von
Luekner with enormous wealth. It seems to be
true, at any rate, that he fitted out the See-Adler
at his own expense, and that he was given a free
hand by Berlin’s navy heads, a roving commission
after the manner of the old-time privateers. Neither
M.L. nor Australia is new to the captive pirate. He
was in these parts a few 7 years before the war.
It isn’t all buttered toast to be an arch-
bishop. A while ago Archdeacon D’arcy
Irvine (Sydney) was made Vicar-General.
Then Archdeacon Boyce resigned,, but allowed
it to stand over till the beginning of this
year so that the Archgaiters might think up
something. The Archgaiters got out his pipe
(Australia has corrupted him—he smokes a
pipe now), decided to have an Archdeacon
of Sydney, and Boyce got the job—as com-
pensation, no doubt, for the gout that the
strenuous old water-waggoner is a martyr
to. And all is peace again.
The Anglican Church at Mackay (N.Q.),
destroyed in the cyclone lately, was built in
the early ’eighties by Albert Maclaren, who
afterwards founded the Anglican Mission in
Papua. His curate was C. G. Barlow, who
later on wore gaiters at Townsville and
Goulburn (N.S.W.) ; and Melba sang in his
choir for a while. Dr. Anderson, who now
bishes at Ilay (N.S.W.), looked after his
first collection-plate at Mackay.
“Reggie” Black, M.L.C., the Pioneers’
Club spruiker on Anniversary Day in Syd-
ney, is the grandson of a man who left Eng-
land in 1797 as purser on a vessel of which
he was part-owner. When some months out
the crew mutinied and killed almost all the
officers. Black was spared on account of his
knowledge of seamanship, and was put with
some others in an open boat. They landed
on the shores of Brazil and then went to
Rio, where they were treated with the
greatest kindness. The party was soon after
picked up by a warship, and when some
Spanish prizes were captured. Black was put
in charge of one, which he sailed to the Cape
of Good Hope, where the cargo was sold, the
captain’s share being £2OOO. With that in
his pocket he arrived in Sydney Cove in
1795. He was the father of John Black,
who became manager of the Bank of
Wales; and thus son Reggie, now 73,
turned to finance instead of the sea. The
grandfather, by the way, was lost sight of
on a voyage to China.
Dead at 77, Colonel Hume, whose uame
had been on the Maoriland pay-sheet and
pension-list for nearly 30 years. After serv-
ing with a Highland Regiment in India, Hume
went back to England to become an officer
in the Prisons Department, and was deputy-
governor of the great penal establishments
at Millbank and Dartmoor. Maoriland,
wanting an Inspector of Prisons in ’SO,
naturally imported one and Ilume got the
job, subsequently becoming Commissioner of
Police. He was a typical product of the
school he had been reared in, caring abo t
as much for modern methods of prison ad-
ministration as he did for poetry—a. short,
stockily-built man. with a harsh voice, an
enraged moustache and a kindly feeling
towards everyone who didn’t run foul
of red-tape and regulation No. 1691. Most
ot Hume’s official life was spent in telling
someone to go to blazes. Most of the rest
was spent going to the races and trying to
pick ’em. lie was a confirmed punter.
After the Big Push in Palestine
Tom Stewart, a well-known Queensland and N. S.
Wales shearer, was shot through the arm; it was
a ghastly wound, yet he refused medical assistance
until his more dangerously-mangled mates were
looked to. Eventually he was placed on a camel,
but halfway to the dressing-station shrapnel killed
the camel and blew off the wounded arm. Tom
managed, for all that, to reach the Australian hospi-
tal in Cairo; but there septic helped one of the
bravest over the river. He had an old mate of
the shearing-sheds with him at the end —Trooper
Wharton. There’s none of us not proud to call him
cobber.
Captain Frank Worsley, R.N.R., who
skippered Shackleton’s lost ship in the
Antarctic and navigated the explorers’ open
boat on the great 760-mile voyage from
Elephant Jsland, has won the D.S.O. for
a smart bit of work with a submarine. A
Maoriland boy, he was raised at Akaroa and
went to sea in the sailing clippers of the
’eighties, .first learning to send down a royal-
yard on the old ship Wairoa. Later he was
an officer in the Government steamers Hine-
moa and Tutanekai, and as second mate was
the navigating expert. Then he was given
the Government schooner Countess of Ran-
furly to run in the South Sea trade, and the
way he had of sending his three-master full
tilt at the reefs of Aitutaki or Niue or Su-
warrow and bringing her up within a neck
of the hurdle, sails, ropes and blocks making
a hurricane of a row and scaring seven bells
out of his passengers and the folk ashore,
brought him fame for daredevilry all over
the Eastern Pacific. He is a number-one
chanteyman, and if you hear a South Sea
brown sailor with a tattooed face and rings
in his nose bellowing “Blow the Man Down”
or “Sally Brown’s a Fine Mulatto,” the odds
are that he was in one of Frank Worsley’s
schooner crews.
THE TIME FOR SELF-DENIAL.
OLD PHATT ( reprovingly): “No, no,
Thomas. ’ARE a chicken I ordered, an’
no finger-hotels! We must think uv
the poor fellers in the trenches!”
Lots of ancient mariners are off back to
the salt sea these days. Shortage of quali-
fied sailormen for oversea voyages is one
reason, and the resurrection of all sorts of
old sailing craft is the other. An Auckland
(M.L.) veteran who went off blithesomely
to the South Seas the other day, though
somewhere in his seventies, is Captain W.
Ruthe, one-time a skipper in the Shaw-
Savill windbag fleet. He commanded the
barque Helen Denny 30-odd years ago. Ruthe
was a “square-rigged” sailor in his clipper
days; nathless he is wise to the ways of fore-
and-afters. Once upon a time the Old Man
owned Rotoroa Island, in the Hauraki Gulf,
and ran a fishing business. Nowadays the
isle is one of M.L.’s homes for dipsomaniacs:
the Blood and Fire army owns it and diets
the chronic beer-cliewer on fresh snapper and
ditto air until he is O.K.’d and released —
whereupon he mostly makes furiously for the
nearest pub.
The biggest testimonial that the unpopu-
lar Asquith is likely ever to get is con-
tained in the new biography of Charles
Dilke, who knew everybody worth knowing
in his generation. He preferred Winston
Churchill to Randolph, and gave Asquith
the advantage over Disraeli and Gladstone.
But he admitted that no modern conversa-
tion came up to that he heard in Boston
about IS7O, from Longfellow, Agassiz.
Dowell and Oliver
Wendell Holmes.
On the verdict of
Stepniak that
Holmes, Mazzini
and Bismarck 'were
the three finest
talkers of modern
times, he said that
Mazzini was in-
clined to be “a
little of the bore,”
and Disraeli
“sometimes singu-
larly silent.” For
himself he had a
fancy for two Rus-
sians as conversa-
tionalists —Tourge-
nief and Herzen.
MULGA
TAYLOR,
New Speaker of
W.A. Assembly.
Died last week C. A. Chesney, old N. S.
Wales mining man, who made his biggest
punch out of the Chesney at Cobar. He
had a good scientific training, but was
always too overcrowded with schemes to
make a fortune out of any of them. Sam
McCaughey was a cousin, and Chesney spent
a lot of time on Yanco laying out irrigation
channels and so on.
How Admiral Creswell’s son died (the
story comes from old-contributor “Bowyang,”
of the Camel Corps, “on the way to Jeru-
salem”) : —•
We have suffered to-day. Captain R. W. Cres-
well, who was feeling his way forward, ordered his
men to lie low whilst he took a peep over a hill—
it was in the fighting around Beersheba. A Boche
machine-gunner was watching for a felt hat to rise
over that part of Palestine, and Creswell never knew
what hit him. Back with the men Lieut. Dawson,
of the same company, saw Creswell fall. He raced
up to see what had happened. Again the Boche
machine-gunner pulled the lever, and Dawson fell
across Creswell’s body. Four men rushed to his
assistance, not heeding Dawson’s last words: “Look
out, hoys; we’re covered with a machine-gun.” The
four men fell around their officers. Captain Creswell
was a good sport and a good Australian; to his
men a mate, only differing from them in this —that
he thought it was his business to take all the chances.
“Bill Bowyang” : If Australia wants immi-
grants, there’s a few with us
here in Palestine we could do
with. One Tommy, wounded
in three places, staggered into a
dressing-station at midnight,
dragging an unconscious xAus-
tralian. He wasn’t talking,
but they pieced the story to-
gether. He had come across
“the dinkum” two miles back,
and, finding that there was still
a flutter under his tunic, had
dragged him in, the journey
taking five hours! Another,
with both legs fractured, was
surrounded by wounded cobbers.
He managed to crawl from one
to the other of them and ban-
daged them. He was still look-
ing for somebody that he reck-
oned needed help when he sank
on his arm unconscious from
loss of blood; and he never stirred again.
Parkes’s old mountain residence at
Faulconbridge has just been sold by the
mortgagees, the Allen family. The old Par-
liamentary hand took up 640 acres at £1
per acre, with a residence condition. The
Allen family advanced £9344 on it, and of
course had to foreclose.
Albert Edward Budd, executed at Mel-
bourne Gaol the other day, was the 173rd
person to be given to the gallows in Vic-
toria. Four of the sacrifices were women.
TWO SCOUTS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Spent is the bitter storm of lead,
And sorrow upon my heart is lying,
For smiling Arthur Malone is dead,
And Harry Devine is dying.
All night long we surged, and crept,
And crawled, and streamed over hill and hollow ;
Ml night long the guide-lights leapt,
And the ghostly squadrons strove to follow.
Often the awesome hush was rent
By a rudely-startled Mauser’s rattle,
And shrapnel rained from the firmament
In the gloom before the battle.
Grey dawn broken on the Ziklag post,
A dense, white fog came hovering over ;
Broadsides chorused along the coast,
Driving the foe to earth and cover.
A filmy veil of mist was drawn
On the ridge where two scouts paused and waited ;
The east was blurred in the weeping dawn,
And never the fog abated.
Two scouts mounted and rode abreast
Towards the east where the Turks were lying.
Squadrons streamed from the hoof-stirred west
When a fireless sun through the mist was prying.
Many a sniper loosed his bolt
In the autumn morning grey and chilly—-
Malone rode forth on the sorrel colt
With Devine astride the filly.
A mile behind we followed fast,
And the red sun burst the clouds asunder ;
The whole line paused and stood aghast
When the Turkish guns began to thunder.
The fog had cloaked the danger zone,
And proved a boon to the troops advancing
On the ridge where the Turks were lying prone,
The sun on their bayonets dancing.
Two scouts halted a mile ahead,
And turned their backs on a hedge of wire
That fenced a low ridge whipped with lead
And loud with the roll of rifle fire.
Sunlight glistened the dew-damp rock,
And lieliographed with tell-tale flashes
On buckle and spur and rifle stock
A rhythm of dots and dashes.
Eight hoofs rang on the stony flat,
And two scouts galloped for home together;
Shrapnel riddled Malone’s felt hat,
And severed Devine’s off-stirrup leather.
Knee to knee in a hail of lead
They raced, low over the withers lying. . . .
But smiling Arthur Malone is dead,
And Harry Devine is dying.

Said wise old George Judah Cohen, the
chairman, addressing the shareholders:—
When we last met I called attention to the neces-
sity for economy to enable the country to bear the
enormous burden of debt caused by the war. I can
on this occasion only reiterate what I then said.
I regret that so far there is no evidence of any
serious attempt at economy by the people. Extrava-
gance is only too apparent everywhere and in every
form, and unfortunately seems to be on the increase.
It is easy come easy go. The Defence
Department is pouring out money. When
war starts all ordinary rules are thrown
aside —or it has been so everywhere hitherto ;
whether it is going to be so in the U.S.A.
this time is doubtful. Expense doesn’t mat-
ter. The military person—on the whole the
most incompetent person in the world —
takes command. He has usually spent his
life filling in time. At the art of bluffing
lie has become a pastmaster, from the general
down to the private. Now he proceeds to
justify himself. He magnifies his job and
his importance and his sole capacity for
dealing with this matter by pushing the
“civilian” aside. Expense—how dare any-
one talk about expense! So shins, which
cost tens of thousands to fit up, are gutted.
Take the fittings out in sections, so that
they may be presently replaced? Rubbish !
In goes the axe. Of course in such circum-
stances the thieves soon congregate. Turn
on the light of public criticism? Who dares?
Criticise the military? Reflect upon the
administration of the War Office or the
Defence Department, as the case may be?
Actually these people make this an offence!
In England, to a great extent, they have
stonned this nonsense. The War Office (and
this is more largely due to Asquith than to
Lloyd George) has to put up with criticism.
But in Australia the old bluff still prevails
—simply because there is more reason why
it should prevail: more reason, that is. in
the incompetence of the administration.
Three months ago a commission of commer-
cial men reported on the business side of
the Department. That report has not been
published yet. And that was not the first
committee of inouiry. Another sat for
months: it included two men of high ouali-
fieations as accountants and business sys-
tomatisers. Its report was never published.
With such a department, thus spending,
let us reflect, now £100,000.000 a year—say
the average value of five Australian wheat
crops, or the total Australian production of
gold for 10 years past—with a Prime Min-
ister whose idea of settling a miners’ strike
is to instruct an “Arbitration” judge to put
up the oriee of coal 3s. per ton. and with
State Governments whose way of getting
votes is to buy them with loan and other
money, is it any wonder there is extrava-
gance? But. as the same wise old financier
added in Iris address to the shareholders in
this bank :
That strict economy will sooner or later be forced
on the community is clear to everyone versed in
financial matters, and the sooner the public can be
made to realise this the better it will be for the
country.
Meantime N. S. Wales remains the most
shocking example of extravagance. With
money to burn, the public is bled by every-
body with anything to sell. According to
the invaluable Ivnibbs. what could be bought
for £1 in lflll cost, as an average, 28s. Id.
in 1917; in Melbourne it cost 255. lid., in
Adelaide and Perth 245. lid. and in Bris-
bane 235. 7d. In the ordinary course of
business the Commercial of Sydney takes its
bite out of the abnormal profits made in
X. S. Wales, where most of its business
lies; hence, though it is pretty certain that
the management made provision for all sorts
ot’ contingencies, the disclosed profit for last
half-year was a third greater than it was
for the corresponding half of DIO. The
shareholders, however, get only the old 10
p.c., though £lO is worth no more now to a
bank shareholder than to anybody else.
As usual, the Commercial maintains a
very strong position so far as liquid assets
are concerned. This table shows that and
a few other features: —

Premises.. . . 555,593 593,253 601,255
Liquid assets are thus nearly 12s. in the £ of
liabilities—an exceptional holding. Of course
a lot of it is earning good money—rather
more than half of the total: there is, roughly,
five millions of it in public securities and
over a million at short call in London, most
of it no doubt awaiting transfer on account
of sellers of Australian products.
It is not much use talking about the
future. Nobody knows what it will be.
Nobody knew, apparently, what the condi-
tions were going to be during the war. In-
stead of hard times, such as the people have
felt during every other great war, there have
been bulging purses. The change has been
due to the development of credit. Credit
means, in plainer language, going into debt;
and unless you happen to be a Bolshevik,
going into unproductive debt to-day means a
struggle to get out of it to-morrow. This in
the ordinary course of things would, mean low
property values ; and that is liable to mean
heavy loss of principal by banks that have
been imprudent in making advances.
Whether they can hide those losses depends
then upon the inner reserves they have put
by. But as to current profits the banks in
Australia will perhaps not suffer seriously.
For one thing the earnings of their own capi-
tal promise to be large. This bank, for in-
stance, has visible reserves which have just
exceeded its share capital of £2.000.000. In
other words it has over £4.000,000 of its own ;
and interest is not going to be low for many
years—perhaps the general run of accommo-
dation charges will never be as low again :
taking all things into account in Australia
they have been astonishingly low; and so,
of course, has the interest allowed on
deposits. •

Another pound or two better than the pre-
vious best. The N. S. Wales State borrow-
ing boom and the consequent inflated prices
have been right into the hands of this bank.
Eight years ago it had £980,781 of old assets
in the shape of station properties, etc. They
were mostly sediment, and, though severely
written down, many of them were non-pro-
ductive or thereabouts. The chairman told
the shareholders the other day that of the
whole £980,781, only £00,895 was left on the
books —“and we are satisfied that the ulti-
mate result will be perfectly satisfactory to
the shareholders. Where there has been any
loss on the book value the same has been pro-
vided for.” In the early days of this,
clearing-out there was no contingency
fund to make losses good, and any such
losses had to be charged against profits on
current business, which probably accounts
for the poor little net profit of 12. and 14
thousands disclosed in some of the earlier
lines of the table. But later on, apart from
any profits made on sales themselves while
high prices were ruling from 1912 onwards,
the bank acquired a contingency fund pro-
vided by the repurchase of 4 p.c. inscribed
deposits. Under the bank’s articles £15,000
is to be employed each half-year in buying
that paper, and, as it is done in the open
market, this means a profit of about £lO.OOO
a year—money which could most properly
be applied towards making good any losses
on the sale of old assets. This source of
profit won t dry up for a good many years—
will keep running so long, in fact, as money
is worth more than 4 p.c. and there are any
inscribed deposits to buy. Already there
ought to be a handy inner reserve; and there
is still £1,514,705 to be repurchased.
Seven years ago current and fixed deposits
totalled £1,975.313, and capital and inscribed
deposits were £2,878,000. Figures like that
made a strong appeal to people with money
for deposit. Some consideration had, of
course, to be given to the quality of the
assets. And that was all right even seven
years ago; and with the conversion of the
old sediment into cash or new live advances,
the position has gradually become still
better. It is not very surprising, therefore,
that in seven years the deposits have almost
doubled: they stood on December 31 at
£3,751,522. The difficulty has been to get
new sound advance business to keep pace
with this. For it was not only a matter of
getting employment for the new deposits: as
previously shown, nearly a million of old
station and other assets have been sold and
tlje purchase money has become available,
too. At December 31 the bank had liquid
assets equal to slightly oyer 50 p.c. of its
liabilities apart from inscribed deposits.
Moreover, it owed (deposits, etc.) only £3 ss.
for each £1 of share capital and reserves,
reckoning the inscribed deposits neither as
capital nor as debt. In the hunt for new
advance business the plan of getting it in a
wholesale line by buying up a smaller bank
at a valuation was of course discussed ; and
during the past half-year arrangements were
made for the purchase of the City Bank of
Sydney. This will satisfy the appetite of
the A.B.C. for a while; but there is no
reason why it shouldn’t take another couple
of millions of deposits and make another
million or more of advances.
Principal movements, in the past three
years are shown in the next table:—

The City on June 30 last had £2,170.000 of
the public’s money (deposits, etc.) in the
business, and the purchase price is £350,000.
I he latter is the only monev that has to be
paid out in cash. But the City will bring in
mote than that much cash. So the position
will be, if the A.B.C. holds all the City’s
liabilities will amount to
£0,400.000, which will still be less than five
times the share capital and reserves, whereas
eight times is not regarded as out-of-the-way
in Australia and 12 times is reckoned a fair
thing in England ; and liquid assets will be
•approximately £2,607,000, or a shade over
41 p.c. of the liabilities, and that is a reason-
able figure even for these uncertain days.

The 13 p.c. dividend is paid free of income
tax, and the chairman confessed that it
“really amounts to £l7 6s. Bd. p.c. gross.”
Prior to the war the dividend was 8 p.c., also
free of tax ; so that the war, out of which
nobody ought to be making a penny, has its
compensations so far as the shareholders of
this very fortunate co. are concerned. And
if it were not an English eo. it might easily
'have paid another 40- p ; c. The British, Gov-
ernment has, however, been less content
than the Australian Government to pass the
war bill on to the future; during the past
year it called on this cq. for no less than
£175,710. The following little table is a
bitter reflection on Australian war finance;
it shows the amounts paid by this co. in
taxes: — • * ■
English. Australasian. Total.

1916 .. 48,706 32,921 81,627
1917 . . 175,710 62,767 238,477
More shocking still, of the £62,767 paid in
Australasia last year £9455 was the total of
Federal taxes. The State Governments have
no war bill to pay; nevertheless they have
taken advantage of the war to put their
taxes up to £41,537. The British Govern-
ment collected out of the abnormal profits
which this co. has made upwards of £150,000
towards its war bill. Australia, where the
bulk of the profits were made, collected
under £lO,OOO for the same purpose.
Meantime, to make its neglect worse in
this case, the Commonwealth Government
put business into Dalgety’s hands—gave it,
in fact, a monopoly in some lines—from which
the co. must have derived many tens of
thousands of pounds in commission. In the
year preceding the war the gross earnings,
before paying salaries and current exes.,
were £570,510. In the past year they were
£861,793. The bulk of this increase has been
made out of war prices. The wool clip, for
instance, was sold at the average price per
ib. of the 1918-14 clip with 55 p.c. added :
and on metals and some other products the
advance has, on the whole, been a good deal
more than 55 p.c. The British Government
gave us a lead. The Commonwealth Gov-
ernment followed the abominable old Aus-
tralian practice of putting the bill on the
file, so that those who have made no profit
out of the war, but probably have suffered
heavily by it, will presently have to pay
almost as much as those who have made
fortunes.
The co., like most others in the pastoral
finance business, had a large amount of pro-
perty thrown on its hand in the 'nineties;
and for some years thereafter its principal
asset was “advances on land, stations, stock,
wool and other produce, including property
held by the co.” Proporlios have, however,
been realised; and if the co. holds any at all
in these days, apart from freehold and lease-
hold premises, there is no specific mention of
it in the accounts. Nowadays the co., backed
by its good name, has developed the finest
commission and agency business in Australia,
assisted thereto by its very ample resources
of secured capital. This next table shows
how various items have moved during the
past few years :

The co. owes sundry creditors £736,000 more
than it did 12 months ago; but that is
mostly due (as is also the reduction in
advances) to the superb time most of its
big clients are having : those who had debits
now have credits. Incidentally, in addition
to the co.’s magnificent reserves, it has
written down its freehold and other premises
by another £100,000; and these and sundry
plant and furniture accounts will now stand
at £388,848, which is considerably,.less than
half their cost and a great deal less than
their market value.

Not quite so glittering as the previous year ;
still a very fine performance, particularly in
view of the directors’ decision not to bump
up the selling prices of most of their staple
lines. “In fact,” they say, “papers, plates,
spools and cameras were sold last year at
a very much lower rate than in England and
America.” That is probably good business
policy; Australia offers an unlimited scope
for camera work, and the future of this co.
depends on the extent to which it can popu-
larise the hobby. And bumping up prices
wouldn’t help. The co. has had a remark-
ably successful career. Formed in 1908 to
take over and extend the business of Baker
and Rouse, it started with a clean balance-
sheet, nothing being paid for goodwill or
patents and processes, while establishment
exes, were only £478. For the “actual tan-
gible assets” of the old business £74,900 was
paid in £1 shares, and £75,100 of new capital
was put up.
This shows the progress in another way:

No new capital has been got in, though
£30,000 of reserves were capitalised three
years ago. In eight years liabilities have
increased by £31,510; but additions to the
more or less liquid assets alone have
amounted to £129,387, while £43.096 has
been added (net) to freeholds and buildings.
In 1909, plant, etc., was valued at £28,120;
and though at least £25,000 has been
spent on new plant, as written down the
item now figures in the balance-sheet at onlv
£21,724. The increase of stocks, valued “a't
cost or under,” has reached the speed limit:
1913, £88,074 ; 1914, £94,448 ; 1915, £89.000 :
1916, £133,074; 1917, £166,541. A lot of
that increase is due, no doubt, to war prices;
and as there is almost certain to be a slump
after Sammy has finished the war, there is
liable to be a considerable amount of writ-
ing down to be done on the stock-sheets of
most Australian importers. All the ships
of the world, says Prof. Lefroy, the British
Government’s wheat expert, will race to the
countries that have food when the war ends;
and that is pretty certain to mean heavy
imports to Australia. Hence heavy stocks

have always to be viewed with suspicion.
With least suspicion, of course, in a trade
whose lines are handled by few people ; tor
there throat-cutting can generally be avoided.
This is one of those trades.
There are few trading cos. which can show
such fine, quick results. Since 1910, in
addition to a bonus of £30,000 in shares,
shareholders on an capital _ot
£150.000 have received £184,500 in divi-
dends. And for every £1 of share capi-
tal there are assets worth over £1 14s.
Some of those assets (like the stock)
may be liable to get into trouble._ But there
are others, like the co.’s remaining interest
in the Eastman-Kodak Co., which are no
doubt worth a good deal more than book
value. Nice little profits have been made
by the sale of Eastman-Kodak shares in past
years: but the holding is now down to
£12,430 —rather less than half of what it
was originally.

The liquidator has declared a first and
final dividend of 3d. per share on the shares
of Hargraves Consolidated (N.S.W.). This
old show- was resurrected five years ago by
H. E. Pratten. He spent £13,000 trying the
known saddle reef and chasing new ones.
The 10,000 tons crushed yielded only IOOOoz.
gold, so it’s not surprising that Pratten
transferred his affections to Malayan tin
shows.

C.S.A., Cobar (N.S.W.), has now its two
furnaces in commission, the first treating ore
and metal-bearing fluxes, and the second
raising the grade of the matte produced in
No. 1 furnace to 45 or 50 p.e. Last week 728
tons were smelted for 25 tons copper, an
average extraction of 3.4 p.c. ;* also 90 tons
first matte were retreated for 52 tons of
shipping matte containing 22 tons copper.
Assuming that C.S.A. can maintain an out-
put of 80 to 100 tons per month, its revenue
with copper at present price will be much in
excess of its issued capital (£78,000), a con-
dition very favorable for dividends.

The Yetliolme Development and Mining
Co. has been registered to take over the
Molybdenite Options Syndicate’s ground (42
acres) near Bathurst (N.S.W.). This will
put three cos. on the field—the Mammoth,
Aiount Tennyson and Yetholme —and that
very nearly covers the ground. The Yetholme
has done very little work, but the ore is
believed to be worth as much as the Mam-
moth’s alongside; and “trial parcels from
each treated by the same process assayed re-
spectively 1.7 n.c. and 1.8 p.c. molybdenum
disulphide.” The Mammoth’s plant is just
about ready; but it ought to be made quite
clear that it is going to be put on picked
stuff at the outset, and what the whole mass
is worth —or whether it is worth anything at
all —has yet to be demonstrated. The man
who feels like a plunge on the strength of
the early Mammoth returns ought to remem-
ber that it is only the favorable opinions on
Yetholme that have been published.
Bob Turner’s Bodangora (N.S.W.) is
moulting badly. In Dick’s mine six months’
work gave only 2750 tons of ore, a good deal
of which was stope remnants and pillars.
Mitchell’s shaft workings furnished 362 tons,
and the Horseshoe shaft 84 tons. As cash
returns amounted to only £6852, the co.
drifted to the tune of £SIS. Ore reserves
are 2670 tons at Dick’s shaft, 650 tons at
the Horseshoe and 1530 tons at Mitchell’s,
averaging about 355. per ton, so that unless
prospecting at the Horseshoe and Mitchell’s
looks up it won’t be long before the co. will
have to think about a final clean up.
Assets about equal liabilities, but a peanut
may be got out of the stopes if development
is abandoned.

Just wdien C. B. Longbottom handed in
his checks, his pet mine, Cope’s Creek Cen-
tral (N.S.W.), turns the corner and pays
the mostly-Melbourne shareholders a div.
Want of labor kept No. 1 plant down to
two shifts last half-year, so that only 18 tons
tin oxide were got from 86.254 cub. yds. The
ground is very tough and cemented, so costs
mopped up 11.821 d. per yd. This is lid.
per yd. less than in the June term, but it is
much too costly to give the profits that the
ground should have yielded had sluicing gone
without a break. The barge is now in No.
37 paddock, where better conditions and
higher-grade ground give promise of a very
profitable average. Nos. 2 and 3 plants have
had easier jobs on Skeleton Creek. There
they handled 136,400 cub. yds. and 113,287
cub. yds. respectively, and garnered 681 tons
tin oxide at a cost of from B|d. to 91d. The
result of all this is a net profit of £2496 for
the half-year. The co. ended 1917 with
liquid assets of £7365 to set against £2719
of debts, so it can afford the shilling div.
In April, 1916, the sinking of the shaft at
the State-subsidised Iguana Consols, Croydon
(Q.), was commenced with the intention of
reaching the main body at 1200 ft. By the
end of 1916 the shaft was down 67ft., and
the whole of last year’s work added only
another 113 ft. Croydon is depending on
this shaft to give it another lease of life,
but if sinking operations do not proceed at
a greater pace than last year’s record of 2ft.
per week the chances of Croydon ever seeing
the bottom of the shaft look black. Working
one shift, with four men per shift, part of
the time with hand steel until the ground got
too hard and then with Jack Hammers,
doesn’t make much impression when the hole
has to be cut 15ft. by sft. in hard granite,
with water increasing at every foot sunk.
Tenders have been let to sink 600 ft. by con-
tract, but this when finished will only see
780 ft., with still 500 ft. to go. Meantime
surface expenses to the tune of £lOO per
month go on all the while. By the way.
isn’t that 2ft. per week about a record in
shaft sinking?
* * * *
The outlook for Croydon (Q.) is very
gloomy. Since August last, when all opera-
tions below the No. 1 south level at the
Content Block ceased, work on the field’s
last productive mine has been mainly con-
fined to driving this level and stuping above
it towards the grass roots. While patches
of good stone worth up to 4oz. over a width
of 15in. have been obtained, its days are
apparently numbered, for on following the
stone up the main break nothing worth work-
ing was disclosed. As the gold won here is
worth under 30s. per oz., there is not much
left after expenses are met.

At Gympie (Q.) last year’s dividends
totalled £20,808, and calls took £21,433. The
field crushed 91,054 tons for 40.8370 z.. but
of this Scottish Gympie alone put through
86.400 tens for 27,9810 z.. averaging 6dwt.
llgr. No. 2 N. Columbia crushed 1541 tons
for 50580 z. and paid £13,000 in dividends,
while No. 1 N. Columbia next door crushed
349 tons for 1009 oz. and distributed £3459.
No. 3 N. Columbia, which did so well three
years ago, is now on the call list. An old
Sydney favorite, the S. Glantnire and Monk-
land, is distributing 2d. per share from
proceeds of the sale of plant.

outside ground on the Brunswick line, six
miles south of Pall Mall. The co. has 650
yds. on the line of reef, which shows its
modesty when so much vacant land is avail-
able round about. Fred Tricks is the plucky
one to take it on with a £10,500 co. His
attraction is a 4ft. reef on an east back and
a parallel western formation, out of which
old-timers are said to have scooped 2oz. and
3oz. stone. Two shafts are down, so every-
thing is O.K. for the jig—a good record,
stone showing and a market that wants a
tonic. m
Bendigo Amalgamated’s yield for the past
fortnight has dropped to 1158 oz. from 5076
tons, so all the newspaper talk about better
prospects didn’t stand the battery test. An
extraordinary meeting this month is to give
directors power to go to the bank to get a
blister on the assets. The need for accom-
modation is because of low yields, recon-
struction of plant, purchase of machine
shop, and the starting of a stores branch.
But why go to the bank, if the promoters
guaranteed £100,060 on the contributing
shares?
* * * *
Dalmayne Collieries (Tas.) directors have
been in a nice stew over their mine. Owing
to a misunderstanding the rents were not
paid ; and the co.’s leases were bunched with
a lot of others and gazetted as forfeited.
Of course there was a scamper then: not
only the co. but two others paid the pre-
scribed rent, and in the ordinary course the
other two would have as good a chance as
the co. The directors were, however, soon
on the doormat of Mines Minister Lewis,
and barrister Alban C. Morley was able to
persuade his also-learned friend that (1) it
was all an accident, (2) the co., having
spent £20,000 on the show, had given ample
evidence of its bona fidcs, and (3) nobody
in sight had as good a moral claim to the
property or was likely to do as well for
Tasmania. So Morley left with the assur-
ance that at the next Executive meeting the
leases would be submitted with a recom-
mendation that they be regranted in pursu-
ance of powers in the Act which cover acci-
dental occurrences of the kind. The co.’s
jetty is being extended 150 ft. to a total of
550 ft., and the directors are considering the
desirability of a further extension of 150 ft.
The ropeway was tested 10 days ago, and is
in good working order. The loading scheme
on the jetty was also tested, and shows a
capacity of 100 tons per hour, and save for
minor adjustments it is complete.

High prices and a good supply of water
for sluicine’ helped Arba (Tas.) to make a
profit of £9598 last half-year. At the main
workings most of the term was occupied in
stripping overburden, only 26.595 cub. yards
being sluiced in five weeks for a return of
32 tons of tin oxide. The average yield was
a very satisfactory 2.691 b. per yard, and costs
averaged 10.64 d. At the Easement property
71,885 cub. yards of wash and overburden
returned I.Blb. oxide against a cost of 8.9 d.
per yard. The total yield from both sections
was 89 tons 14cwt. black tin, for a profit
averaging over £lOO per ton. Two six-
pennies absorbed £3150, and £4772 was
written off for depreciation. On December
31, tin, stores and cash totalled £9944 and
liabilities only £403.
* * * *
Fenian Syndicate, Meekatharra (W.A.),
held its half-yearly meeting the other day,
and sharenolders were told that there was
two years’ supply of ore in sight. To date
250,000 tons have been crushed for £BOO,OOO,
»>r thereabouts; and nearly one-half of this
has been paid in dividends. Several attempts
have been made to buy the mine for dota-
tion ; but nothing has come of them. The
show is owned by a local syndicate, in which
Dung figures prominently. Apart from the
Fenian and its equally productive neighbor,
the iugliston Consols, and one or two
smaller shows, such as the Gwalia and
Ingliston, life has now almost passed out of
the once flourishing Meekatharra field.
“Oof Bird” :Edna May Central’s reconstruc-
tion is another instance of what happens after
directors have distributed with a loud whoop
what should have been held in reserve. I
don’t know if that was their object, but 1
do know the result of the dividends was to
prop ui) the market to the advantage of in-
side operators. When I saw the mine a
couple of years or so back it was being
worked in the typical go-as-you-please way :
no proper sampling or plans showing ore
reserves and values —only estimates, which,
as usual, were not borne out by battery
returns. An mgs are different now, and
shareholders cannot blame those at present
in charge of the mine for the collapse which
has taken place in the co.’s finances. For
a Board of a weakly-financed mining ven-
ture to pay dividends before its permanency
has been established is reprehensible; but as
shareholders do not seem to mind, and as
those who fell in are silent as the grave,
perhaps it is not worth butting in. Still,
the public should remember to stop, look and
listen when early dividends are paid by a
mining co. whose shares are much used as
gambling counters.
■»•***
The hopelessness of making money out of
Payne’s Find ( W.A.) has at last p been ad-
mitted. For some time the show was
kept alive by Perth and Adelaide call-payers,
and then a number took The Bulletin’s
advice and dropped out. Later on, when
the co. had had enough, one of the biggest
shareholders, C. M. Yeomans, bogged in. and
now, after years of battling with short
shoots and hard country, he has given in
and shareholders are told the mine is no
good. It never was for a co., anu never
should have been acquired by one.
« * * #
Leonora Blocks (W.A.) has again
changed managers, this time .Tim Cole, a
large shareholder, taking control. As this
mine appeared from frequently-published
assays to be opening up well, some hard-hit
people are wondering why results have
turned out so badly. The fact is the show
once had a fairly good shoot of ore which
yielded profits to a party of working miners,
but so far nothing has been found big and
good enough for a co.
That pallid Empress, of Mt. Magnet
(W.A.), is still calling up cash to hunt for
something south and north at 400 ft. W.
Rickard got 430 tons out of the mine last
half-year for 1400 z., and since then has
raked up another 350 tons, which averaged
lOdwt. He is going strong, but if he doesn’t
ferret out a rosier prospect south under the
main shoot the directors should find a better
outlet than the Empress for his and their
energies.
* * * *
Theodore Hoover and his pals A. F.
Ivuehn and W. F. Turner have dropped off
the Ynanmi Board, but even with them
absent it takes £2264 to run the co. in Lon-
don, which is a heap too much in war time.
The battery is eating into ore reserves: at
43.767 tons there are 7541 tons less than in
1916. Still values are up 6s. per ton. while
costs keep at 41s. 3d. The co. got £70.000
of gold last year, but after deducting mine
development exes., the credit for the term
dropped to only £1340. With a shoot of
good ore 350 ft. long at No. 6 level south and
a chance of picking up a fresh lens of ore
out to the east the shaft goes down another
lift.
* * * *
Several molybdenite deposits are being
opened up around the disappointing gold-
mining centre of Warriedar (W.A.), and
an option for £l2OO has been taken over
two of them by A. E. Morgans, who has
other irons in the fire there. A number of
alleged molybdenite shows at Leonora and
elsewhere are at present on sale in Perth
and Adelaide, but so far no one has been
game enough to buy them. Someone with
apparently more confidence in Western
mining men than in Western offerings has
ene"i?ed Harley Wright, metallurgist at
Boulder Perseverance, to run a N. S. Wales
molybdenite venture.
Westralian Government lmd a chance the
other day to revive mining interest in the
State and missed it. An Under-Secretary
for Mines was wanted to take the place of
H. S. King, who becomes Surveyor-General
and permanent head of the Lands Depart-
ment. and the selection of a trained mining
engineer with a sound knowledge of local
mining was widely urged. Such an appoint-
ment would have imparted a stimulus to tin-
whole industry, but Cabinet thought other-
wise and gave the next man in the office the
job. An agitation has now started for the
appointment of a Commissioner for Mines
free from all political control, and with
power to help those claim-holders who show
any inclination to help themselves. At pre
sent all sorts of barriers and obstacles are
placed in their way.
* * * *
The old Silver Spur, near Stanthorpe
(Q.), is to be worked again under the
management of M. A. Corrie. The furnace
has been repaired and warmed up, and every-
thing is ready for another smelting run from
a mine that in early days proved exception-
ally rich in silver. A streak of ore has been
discovered parallel to the old workings, and
this formation is now being driven on at
200 ft. A 32-ton parcel of ore treated at
Cockle Creek (N.S.W.) returned 18oz. gold.
10450 z. silver and 2 tons lGcwt. of lead, of
a gross value of £358.

Sydney, February 4, 3915.
My Dear Auini, —
Mrs. Donaldson, wife of the skipper of the
missing Matunga, was the hostess at a little
dinner and theatre party the other evening.
The first difficulty at the matinge for the
Crown-street Women’s Hospital was to find
the programme. It was entombed in £llO
worth of advts. Add £25 from the sale,
and you have something solid towards the
£5OO which lion, organiser Nellie Leach set
out to get. Nellie herself sang at intervals,
and looked like a French bonbon in a tulle
decoration made with a bustle. And hon.
business-manager Gard Trouton —he who
stalked every well-known firm in town for
the advts.—wipes his pince-nez and plainly
resolves to go on paying the bachelor tax.
Girl in the abstract may be in the bloom of life.
Girl in battalions, especially when she’s in
her smart society undress, each little angel
wanting her own way and fighting for it
with her most alluring dimples, is a menace
to the peace of Man.
The matinee was a triumph, in spite of
one aisle in the Tivoli being choked with
the Smart Set’s presentation bouquets to
its dear friends in amateur grease-paint.
Make-up was good, bad and worse; one fair-
haired damsel was rouged to look like a
clown, with hectic spots on each cheekbone.
Goossens was magnificent in the “Barber
of Seville.” Mrs. Bertie Kelly and Neville
Mayman, with Molly Levy and Barbara
Bowker, snipped a page from Peg Woffing-
ton’s life. Peg had ninety-and-nine lives,
judging by the literature that still stirs her
ashes. Barbara Gordon got a cwt. or so
of flowers from her pals in front of the
house. Maggie Jarvis, beautifully frocked
in a blue hat, a very large pendant, and
yards of accordeon pleating, warbled in
French. Miss Segur was in a Paris frock.
Aggie Mitchell squirmed through the Per-
sian Garden in a glittering gold and silver
dancer’s outfit. Lionel Lawson came from
the Flying School, bringing his magic fiddle.
And the stalls had an unrivalled view of
local society strutting across the stage as
drapers’ models.
In consequence of Nellie Leach’s success
at the recent Hospital matinee, H. D.
Mclntosh has persuaded her to take a turn
on the vaudeville circuit. It required some
persuasion, for John Leach pere has been
steadily “agin” professional life for his only
chick. She is a pupil of the late Marchesi
—the wonderful old woman who discovered
the pearls in Melba’s voice. Before going
to Paris to the Marchesi studio, the Neutral
bay girl had lessons from Tosti. This was
during her school days in London.
The Most Excellent Order of the British
Empire is a war-time rash, and various Aus-
tralians are to bear the marks of it. The
inoculation is in the hands of the Governor-
General ; and Easter is likely to witness the
first outbreak. Thereafter, so far as the lady
is concerned, she’s to be “Dame” this or that.
Fortune was very kind to Mrs. Theo
Marks the other Sunday evening. Few
women can let a suit-case with £2OOO-worth
of gems go astray with any chance of seeing
their glitter again. But the aesthetic
Dorothy Marks managed it. She left the
treasure under the seat of a mountain train.
The carriage linked up with an ensine bound
for Albury, and the perambulating jewels
went to the border and came back to Sydney
with never a stone the less. Of course it
isn’t the sort of thing to do as a habit.
Recent visitors to “the East” that is North
say that the N. S. Wales Commercial Agent
of those parts has done what few Europeans
do—he has conquered colloquial Japanese.
At big Japanese functions no man is more
sought after than the tall, white-haired and
masterful member of the Suttor family.
Suttor’s “beat” extends from Peking to
Sourabaya and from Manila to Tokio. As
the man who carried out most of our big
N. S. Wales railway deviations, he knows
the short cuts, or he could not be so well
known as he is throughout “the East.”
A son of the late Frank Norrie, of Rose
Bay, was wed in Kent (Eng.) tftwards the
end of 1917. He’s a Lieut.-Colonel in the
A.I.F. The bride was Jessie Frances
White, a daughter of the manager of a P.
and O. branch line. Second-best man was
Captain Godby, son of the Melbourne Canon.
Vera Samuel, a grand-daughter of the late
Saul —he who achieved a baronetage when
such things were going in Australian official
circles in the wliile-ago—was one of the
attendant maids.
An offshoot of the big Windeyer family,
Alice W. Thompson, of West Maitland, has
been married very quietly in St. James’s
Church to Alfred Gale, of this hamlet. All
the fuss was a day or so beforehand, when
scores of friends and relatives mounted
Farmer’s lift to say nice things to the girl.
One of the well-known Hume family,
originally of the Yass district, was married
in St. James’s the other evening. The bride
was Margaret Edith, a daughter of the late
Andrew Hamilton Hume, of Rye Park. Bro
ther Bruce, of Yass, gave the girl to her new
husband, James B. Dalton, of Epping. Gwen
Slatter attended to the bridal finery, and
H. Milford was second-best man. The first
Hume to make his presence felt in Australia
was the late explorer Hamilton, whose old
home is set in green pastures some miles
out of the town that once had visions of
being the Federal capital.
There’s word of yachtsman Walter Marks
—in peace time commodore of the R.P.A.
Yacht Club —coming home on leave. After
about three years on active service in patrol
work lie’s going to have a whiff of his native
gum-trees.
Sporting man Oxenham is holding his head
a bit higher this week, for son Norman, who
wears a major’s crown in the A.M.C., has a
D.S.O. to his name. Major Norman, three
times mentioned in despatches also, is an
old Riverview boy, who knew the Hun in
his own territory before getting up against
him in France, Macedonia and Egypt. A
younger brother, Gordon, is piloting a ’plane
in the A.F.C.
A former Maoriland resident, A. D.
Spence, now located here, was wed in St.
Stephen’s the other noon. The pretty dark-
eyed bride is a Melbourne girl, Gwladys
Brierly. Mother gave her lass away. There
was a snow-white tailor-made for the cere-
mony, and a dove-gray frock to go away in,
and a very quiet party after the vows were
made.
The Rev. H. M. Powys, who gives out the
text in ugly All Saints’ at Woollalira, had a
weddinv of his own the other afternoon. The
bride was Eliza Skelton, of Laurella, Croy-
don, and the knot was tied in that suburb
by brothers Best and W. L. Langlev. It
was a black-coat affair, with cleric Alexander
te help the ’groom on his pilgrimage.
The c o u n t r y
teacher needs spark-
ing up when she (or
he) comes to town.
And that is where
the Hereford House
Reunion Club comes
in. Founded in 1912
by Lockhart Easton
as a non-political
meeting-place for ex-
students, the war
presently swept out
both president and
secretary on active
service. Other mem-
bers joined the Great
Push, and the Club
almost wilted away
till the beginning of
1917. Since then a
vigorous organisation has been able to send
out a friendly hand to the most isolated ex-
students. District secretaries have waved
their fountain-pens, and the school marra out
back responds. A new constitution —a seri-
ous matter —has been drafted and softly
flicks the existing Summer Schools.
“These’,, says energetic Miss Baker, the
secretary, “left a want. The staff of the
Training College was willing to help us, and
Unfler-Secretary Board has given us the
concession we asked for. An extra School
will be held in one week of our time, another
week being given by the Department. The
main difference between this extra school
and those in existence will be in the range
of subjects. Much midnight oil is spent
over unfruitful study for higher-classifica-
tion exams.; what is needed is a little special
coaching. That’s what it will offer.” A
hostel for young girl-students is another
dream of Hereford House, and a co. may
blossom forth with this as its purpose in life.
There is, in fact, hardly an end to what
Hereford House may do for the teachers of
N. S. Wales; and the movement has in its
lion. general secretary and treasurer,
Frances Baker, a live wire to give it energy.
I send you Judith Fletcher’s little picture
of her.
The minor horrors of recent first-nights in
Sydney theatres may result in comparative
peace amongst the young ladies in the front
of the gallery. Their engaging habit of act-
ing as arbitrators of fashion, and “guying”
anyone whose dress they don’t approve of,
has driven some of the stall-fed theatre-
goers back to the less public d.c. One quiet
maiden who went with a few friends to the
gallery on the occasion of Ivathlene Mac-
donell’s tears says the whole nuisance was
connned to 20 or 30 lady galleryites with
their gentlemen friends to encourage them.
Obviously the general public must get its
quills up when an inconsiderable section of
a crowded theatre takes on the job of dicta-
tor. It may allow one man to be Dictator
of the Commonwealth. But when it comes
to interfering with pleasures, it’s a serious
matter.
Maud, the second daughter of the Ilpar-
ran-Glen Innes Ogilvies, has promised to
make Ernest White, of Bluff Downs, Chart-
ers Towers, North Bananaland, more satis-
fied with things in general. The Ogilvies are
indefatigable war-workerfe. Their Red Cross
toil fetches mamma and the girls to Sydney
fairly often. The bride-to-be is a grand-
daughter of the late E. D. S. Ogilvie, of Yul-
gilbar station—an immense cattle run at the
head of the Clarence River. A matter of 45
years ago grandpa Ogilvie entertained the
then Governor, the Earl of Belmore, at the
homestead, Yulgilbar Towers, a picturesque
many-roomed edifice overlooking miles and
miles of fertile country and many flocks and
herds. Guests came to a great ball, given in
his Ex.’s honor, from all parts of the rivers.
It was a royal entertainment, and the
ancient inhabitants will tell you about it
with goggly eyes to this day. Belmore ex-
pressed himself as having spent there the
most delightful time of his stay in Australia.
Characteristic of Sydney Uni.’s soldier-
Prof. David that he should spend a short
furlough in London attending a conference
of wiseheads who are investigating the better
use of water-power. And it is characteristic
of the muddling of the Defence Department
that a favorite brilliant mining engineer
whom David wanted as his lieutenant is
still kept hanging around an Australian
camp, though he enlisted at the earliest pos-
sible moment —about eight months ago.
In Sydney, on a visit, well-groomed S. A.
Whiteman, who has lived and traded in Ger-
man New Guinea for years. When the Big
Fight struck the Pacific Isles like a typhoon,
Whiteman and British Consul Jolly were in-
terned, but were offered their freedom if they
would give their ’'parole not to do or say
anything to help the Fatherland’s enemies.
Both declined with thanks—and I fancy I
should have liked Whiteman better if he hadn’t
afterwards made a claim on the Common-
wealth for a reward of £5OOO for the help he
says he did render in finding the German
boat Comet when it was cunningly hidden
in a welter of green vegetation.
Mrs. Young, of the Brisbane Courier, has
been here on a brief holiday. Of her two
fine lads one had just passed his final den-
tist’s exam, with great credit when, entering
a Queensland camp, he “contracted typhoid”
—I think that’s the official way of putting
it —and died. The other boy is with the
Engineers at our Roseville camp. Which
means that he will be almost sure to get
away within two years.
A Watson’s Bay girl and an only daugh-
ter, Madeline Selkirk, has a new diamond
ring. The young man is David Champion.
He’s a son of the Rev. A. Champion, now at
Bungendore, one time head of King’s School.
Gertrude Oxenham, of Arran, Neutral
Bay, has accepted a similar token from Clem-
ent McMahon, of Garryowen, Kurrajong.
She’s one of the Ilumphrev Oxenhams. A
brother is that major who has done so well
at the Front.
E. C. C. Knibbs, son of the Common-
wealth Statistician, is in charge of the Sur-
vey Department in the British Solomons,
and is almost as keen a worker as his dad.
He has a charming bachelor home at Tulagi,
and his musical parties when the steamer’s
in port bring all the resident nobility to his
doormat.
Liverpool is to have a big petti invasion
this week. Dr. Mary Booth and 60 of her
devoted girl-helpers are the responsible
parties. They’re making a big concert for
the sojers.
A correspondent across the seas: —
The Australian Red Cross in London is now in
the handsome, roomy mansion at 36 Grosvenor-plaee,
once the town house of Tasmania’s wealthy Governor
Newdigate. It overlooks the grounds of Buckingham
Palace; wherefore it has more light and air than
some of the walled-in tenements that used to shelter
society at a terrific rent in the season. The big hall
of the new premises and the adjacent library are
now offices and an inquiry bureau, where Chief
Commissioner Murdoch and his staff roll up their
cuffs.
There is another pretty Australian girl
in mourning in England. She’s Hilda Rix,
whose first dabble in art was in connection
with the Education Department’s “School-
Paper,” but who later developed into a can-
able miniature painter. She is the widow
of Major G. M. Nicholas, D. 5.0., whose
brothers, Lieut. B. Nicholas, M.C., and Cpl.
F. Nicholas, have also been sacrificed in the
European madness.
For bravery while doing his bit with our
Engineers at Ypres, Vincent Dalziel, of Mos-
man, has’had a Military Medal served out to
him. By way of a change, he lias got a
commission now in Britain’s busy navy.
A former Sydney pressman, T. R.
Roydhouse—he used to edit Sunday Times
—is over from Maoriland. Only for a trip,
He still works away with the nibs, but has a
farm to tether him to the Fern Isles.
The Phil. Society gave its first Saturday-
night pop with a big house to fight for
encores. But conductor Joe Bradley put both
feet on the nuisance, and the programme
had a clear run.
The schoolboy D.C.M., Wallace Freeborn
(you’ll remember how he returned to school
after doing a man’s work in the Big Fight),
has acquired some more honors—three first-
class and four second-class passes at his
leaving exam. He is now booked for the
engineering school of the Uni.
Born in Maoriland
—Wellington was
her native town—
Ella Gorinley, 8.A.,
has lived here long-
enough to have been
a Fort-street girl.
She meant to join the
ordinary teaching-
staff of the N. S.
Wales Education De-
partment, but the
finger of destiny
pointed towards the
sea. About six years
ago the ’partment
put one toe into the
water, so to speak,
by appointing this
virile young woman,
who swims with her
brains, to teach teachers of her own sex
physical culture, life-saving, hockey, etc. The
amphibious billet has grown into an im-
portance not contemplated by the origina-
tors of the experiment. Ella Gormley’s
gift of organisation (during 10 days in the
December holidays 5000 N._ S. Wales school
kiddies were taught to swim) has brought
her. a new billet —Mistress of Physical Cul-
ture in the High Schools. From February 1
she amalgamates that job with her other
work as overseer of the art of making young
primary-school Cornstalks swim like fish
and take first place in athletics in the
field. Here is the energetic lady’s photo.
Judith Fletcher’s camera has done its best,
but it can’t reproduce the fresh pink com-
plexion of the out-o’-door school-marm.
Here’s a message from “very respectfully
y urs, Jules Neuburger,” begging me to
give this notice a place:—
Tun Masonic Bukkau for Allied Armies in France,
16 Rue Cadet, Paris, cordially invites all the
members of the Order to call when in Paris. Eng'-
lish-speaking brethren will be in attendance daily
from 2 to 5 p.m.
“And you, my dear madam,” adds M. Bes-
nard, who is Worshipful Master or some-
thing such, “will, for your sex, doubtless be
glad to know that, in assuring our fraternal
help to your gallant Australian brothers, we
shall be glad also, in case they are ill or
wounded, to serve as intermediary between
them and their relatives.” And, as an after-
thought he adds “etc.” to the “relatives.”
Even Worshipful Masters were boys once.
From “Australia Jane” in Brisbane:—
Died of pneumonia in France, Corporal Russell
Love, eldest son of James Love, of Isles, Love and
Co. Young Love was turned down three times on
account of defective eyesight, but at last signed
on for special duty, leaving Brisbane with the
Motor Transport Column in December, 1916. He was
in the fighting along the Ypres front, and was
reported injured last November. The boy, who was
only 25, was a keen sport and a crack shot. Captain
Tom Macleod, the airman who recently acquired a
Croix de Guerre of the first class, is his uncle—-Mrs.
Love’s brother.
Autumn fashions come in a-tiptoe this
month, with promises of tailor-builts. Taf-
fetas still crackle and rustle in the nattv
high-waisted skirts of the moment.
The late Matthew Harris, knight, left
£32,000, to be cut up amongst sons and
daughters. But there had been a previous
carving. Ultimo, the big dusty estate which
came from his father, the late John Harris,
was sliced up under a deed of settlement
during 1913. Hence the comparatively
small fortune just mentioned in the probate
list.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

Melbourne, February 4, 1918.
My Dear Yarrie, —
It is far from the Malvern Ladies’ Rifle
Club to the trenches of France; but George
Williams, the club's original instructor, has
made the connection. Williams was one of
the practical souls who helped to get the
Australian soldier acquainted with the ser-
vice rifle. He wasn't able to jump away him-
self, having a considerable domestic estab-
lishment to attend to; but many an early
soldier in the field owed to Williams his skill
in potting a far mark. By-and-bye in his
ardor Williams took a hand in starting the
Malvern Club, with Governor Stanley’s own
missus to pull a trigger on the mat. Then
he made arrangements to show the Hun
what could be done in the field, and departed
with the light of battle in his fatherly eye.
lie did more instructing in England before
he crossed the Channel, hut was finally
allowed to hop over and see what it was
really like. Now he has the Military Medal.
From Beersheba to Johanna:—
I hate to contradict a lady; but Mrs. Norman
Brookes in her “Broken Idols” is off the track when
she states that many of our soldiers in Egypt marry
girls of mixed nationality. I’ve been over here
since December, 1914, and during that time I have
only heard of four Billjim weddings, and the other
parties were French ladies whose parents are well
known in Cairo. I’ve heard yarns and yarns about
our chaps having linked up for keeps with ladies
who—who —well, 3 r ou know who —but it's pure fic-
tion. I’ll admit that the gay girls residing in the
Wazar tried to capture Bill, with an eye, of course,
on his three bob a day; but Bill gets sober very
quickly. No, Johanna —Bill’s heart is back in Aus-
tralia. How utterly lots of him didn’t know till he
had tried something else.
Lieut. Ken Stephen has won the Military
Cross. The good-looking youngster is a
nephew of the Madden dame and a step-
nephew also. His dad married Blanche
Travers, whose stepmother was the Madden
dame’s elder sister. The stepmother afore-
said, after some years of widowhood, married
a Polish Count in England—and is wonder-
ing, no doubt, what the title is worth.
Mrs. Norman Brookes is just back from
another submarine-defying act, looking rather
the worse for wear. Red Cross Commis-
sioner Norman, who had been stalking health
in England after a heavy go of Mesopotamian
malaria, has recovered sufficiently to go back
to his work in Bagdad. So Mrs. Brookes
packed up and got back to her trio of young
daughters.
Frank Crozier, who is mentioned now as
a likely successor to popular Fred McCubbin
at the' art school, is at present in France
doing war work. Though of the younger
school of artists, he has exhibited several
times in Melbourne, usually in conjunction
with others. There are examples of his work
in the Anzac Book.
Norman Hodges has had the Military
Cross pinned on his tunic. Just before the
war began he married dashing Vanda
Clarke, daughter of the alphabetical Clarkes,
of Toorak. Vanda has been doing her bit
at a Russian hospital in London. Norman
was born lucky, for he owns, besides
a charming wife, a charming stepmother,
who lives at Macedon in a poetical humpy
composed of rose gardens, mullioned win-
dows, pansies, white walls and flower-covered
pigstyes. Before she became the second
Mrs. Hodges she was widow of Bob
Chirnside.
You oegin to realise that war is Hell
when you get into the Victoria Barracks
and read the solemn inscription at the
inquiry office : —•
NOTICE.
If, after making an inquiry, no reply is received
within 20 minutes, you are kindly requested to
remind the inquiry clerk.
But, of course, the time-allowance for the
Minister of Defence is more liberal.
The field coffee-stalls instituted by Red
Cross efforts for the Australian divisions
have helped old Billjim along. A big officer
says that during the offensive at Ypres men
were heartened wonderfully by a hot drink
and a cigarette shortly after being wounded.
Their appreciation was beyond words —-the
portable stalls made miracles possible; for a
wounded man will bear almost any torture
if he can only close his lips on a cigarette.
Captain Rob Cussen died in a Melbourne
military hospital last week after a hard fight
with pneumonia. A fine fellow and universal
favorite. He was the son of the late Martin
Cussen, M.L.A., of Tally Ho. Mooroopna,
and a brother of Leo, the well-known lawyer.
Here are two more Australian war-babies
with great records. Lieut.-Colonel Donald
Tieehurst Moore (he belongs to both Mel-
bourne and Sydney) commands a battalion
at 24. lie has been wounded twice, D.S.O.'d
and awarded the Belgian Order of the
Crown. Warren Anderson was a Duntroon
lieutenant at 18, and got the crown on his
21st birthday, lie is now on stall duty in
Egypt.
Courtly Staniforth Smith is at present in
Blighty. After a term as Administrator ot
i'apua Staniforth joined the A.I.F. as a
private in 15)10, and eventually got his com-
mission. Having injured his ankle at
Messines. he is doing home duty at Tidworth
until a Board declares him fit for active ser-
vice once more.
They are telling of a refreshing little inci-
dent at a recent function. A venerable per-
sonage commenting on a politician who had
just spoken said: “I can’t stand the d—d
fellow, lie cleans his own boots.” Where-
upon the municipal party on his right
chipped in: “I’m like you, ; my wife
always cleans mine!”
Mrs. E. Wynne, wife of Kew’s First Lord
of the Civic Cupboard, was so unlucky as to
pick up typhoid after she and the family
had tracked to the sea-shoye for a little extra
health. The invalid, who was Miss Rankin,
daughter of a one-time noted city doctor, is
doing well now; but typhoid is a long job.
_ Old Hobart is going gay. The event of
last week was a dinner-party at Government
House, at which the Elect were fed. Lady
Monash had a seat and a plate, and Major
Cottrell Dormer and his wife (he passed
through Melbourne recently returning from'
France) were guests. Others were Captain
Glossop and his new bride. The Bartons
(they are staying at Hadley’s) also managed
to peck a few grains.
Regatta Day in Hobart was gorgeously
trimmed. The Newdigate Excellency and
his lady, with Genthelp Captain Fitz Gerald,
were received by Warden T. Murdoch and
his wife and taken out on the launch Egeria.
Captain Glossop and his bi’ide and Judge
and Mrs. Ewing also lent glitter to the show,
and all hands had morning tea on the U.T.S.
Dart as Captain Newman’s guests. And
when all was over, the sun went down back-
wards in a swirl of tea leaves.
Fritz Hart’s boy Basil is still an inmate
of Mount St. Evins hospital. The fine kiddie
has had to endure several operations since
iiis gun accident of some months ago.
An embittered taxpayer suggests what
looks like a simple remedy for the expensive
Government-motor habit. This ingenious
Goth would have all Government cars painted
a brilliant red, like the postal vans, with dis-
guishing marks to show which Department
was having a week-end joy-ride. The idea
should be adopted at once.
A Victorian squatter-lawyer has a stage-
struck daughter who went to London with a
meagre allowance and without the paternal
blessing. Now dad is worried because his
girl is bringing an expensive breach-of-pro-
mise suit in London against an Australian
squatter who is in the war-zone.
Lady Helen had a small informal tea-
party last week for some returned invalided
soldiers —mostly homing Maorilanders. Our
Brig.-General Johnston and his lady, also the
Norwegian Consul-General and his wife, who
had been lunching at Government House,
joined the tea-party. In the evening the
Maorilanders had another party at the
“Aladdin” panto. There was a delighted
roar from them when the Maori girls
marched on in their brown-grey tights and
grass skirts. Those wahines revelled in
flowers and chocs, for the rest of the week.
The Last of the Belltoppers died on St.
Kilda-road during a raging north wind one
day last week. A newly-decorated personage
was going to lunch at Government House.
He shared an open motor with his missus,
who was in danger of losing her ospreyed
pancake. So Sir Galahad chivalrously let
go his own glittering tile to help his spouse.
Immediately he relaxed his grip, the topper
shot off his head and trundled playfully
under the juggernaut wheels of a road-
mender’s steam-roller.
It’s one thing to get into Gippsland, and
quite another to get out of it, as manv a
roads-and-bridges deputation will yet explain
to Works-Minister MoWhae. Their troubles
are heaviest in winter; but McWhae’s own
summer experience will teach him to lend an
attentive car. He motored lately to Mor-
well, whence he intended to visit his pro-
perty at Budgeree, 15 more-or-less vertical
miles further On. In the hills he took the
wrong turning, and as he couldn’t ’bout-ship
in the narrow cutting, he had to back his
car up a slope for a mile. The machine
caught fire, but Mac., with a touch of genius,
put out the flames with his cargo of soft
drinks. If it had been whisky the car would
have been fumes and ashes in five minutes.
When eventually he set sail for home he
wouldn’t risk the unlucky route again, and
engaged an ox-persuader with six bullocks
to tow his fiery chariot up and then down a
mile-long hogback, until he safely reached
the Boolarra-Welshpool road.
Our pet beauty-consul, Cavaliere Lies, of
Italy has been promoted to the first-class ot
his rank. I don’t know what class he was m
before, but his costume was most becoming.
Bigjolm Forrest, whose head has lately
been the object of medical attention, is now
out of hospital and back at the Grand.
Lieut.-Governor and retired Chief Justice
Stone, of Westralia, who has been in Mel-
bourne for some weeks having his eyes
attended to. is about to take a whirl with
Fate and see if he can’t get a few more
years’ good eyesight by having the cataract-
film removed. Meanwhile he is hob-nobbing
with the G.-G. and generally having as good
a time as the gathering mists will allow.
He nearly perished of laryngitis, by the way,
before making the trip across from Perth,
but now lie feels fit for anything.
Sister Adelaide’s chronicles: —
On Saturday at Mount Lofty there was a carnival
for the benefit of the Prisoners of War Fund. The
promoters had better luck than last year, when the
festivity was washed out by rain. Money came in
freely this time. The Premier’s wife, Mrs. Peake,
formally opened the show, and the Governor put in
an hour or so watching the sports before picking up
the train for Melbourne.
Lieut. Whitington, who was reported killed in
action at Passcliendale, but afterwards turned up as
a prisoner in Germany, has written from Soltau that
he is “getting along famously” and hopes soon to
have his wounded right arm out of plaster of paris.
Members of the Yacht Squadron, with Rear-Com-
modore and Mrs. A. E. Tolley as host and hostess,
turned up in force on Saturday night to say good-bye
to the Commodore, Dr. E. W. Morris, who is going
back to the Front. Every Eligible man belonging to
the club has volunteered for active service and no
eligibles are accepted as new members.
F. J. Mills has resigned the editorship of the
Returned Soldiers’ magazine, and his place is being
filled by Donald Kerr, M.M., who annexed an LL.B.
degree at the University before enlisting.
Dr. Francis Muecke, who is best known to fame as
Ada Crossley’s husband, had the bad luck to break a
leg while tree-chopping in England. It seems a dull
way to get wounded after working in hospitals at
the Front practically since the outbreak of war.
Deserting is not all beer and biscuits. Witness
the case of a quitter who wrote his wife that
he was coming home for a day. The patriotic lady
promptly informed the military police and had them
waiting for him with a boisterous welcome. There
was also the case of the man who was run to earth
between the wire and flock mattresses of a bed, with
his sister reclining on top. The lady in that case
was given her choice of parting with £2O or three
months’ 'liberty for aiding and abetting her frosty-
footed relative.
The State War Council isn’t finding it an easy
business to arrange patriotic appeals for 1918 so
that there shall be no overlapping of the big efforts.
The last half of February has been allotted to the
Central Trench Comforts Fund, to the chagrin of the
Glenelg Progress Committee, which wanted to hold
its usual summer carnival at that time for the benefit
of Red Cross, Trench Comforts and Cheer-Up Funds.
Glenelg next asked for permission to go on with its
carnival, restricting the object to its own particular
Trench Comforts Fund (3rd Light Horse), but that,
too, was refused, and it looks now as if the under-
taking will have to be cried off.
Beryl Cussen, daughter of Dr. and Mrs.
Gerald Cussen, of Sydney-road, Brunswick,
has said “Yes” to David Peter, of Dunalister,
Oaklands. David has returned from the war
and deserves his good luck.
Lou Cadby, a wealthy jeweller, of St.
Ivilda, has quietly taken wife No. 8. She is
Winnie Hogan, a young Tasmanian girl.
The bridegroom, who is 70 or so, is a lover
of horses, two meals a day and the fact that
lie’s entirely self-made. She’s musically
inclined, a good housekeeper and has money
in her own right.
Guido Baracclii, the plutocratic Socialist
who lately got into hot water with the Uni-
versity authorities, has acquired a wife in
the pleasing person of Katrina Tobin,
a decorative feature of the “Aladdin”
panto, chorus. The lady is a brunette with
as beautiful a pair of eyes as any in Mel-
bourne. She has for long cherished histri-
onic ambitions, and had a walking-on part
in Allan Wilkie’s production of “Richard
II.” The deed was done privately at the
house of the Rev. F. Sinelaire, the pictur-
esque Socialistic parson. Guido has given
up his diggings at Oxford Chambers, and the
two have taken a flat in East Melbourne.
The sky was like a tremendous canvas by
Dor£ just before the cyclone hit Brighton
on Saturday. Clouds were heaped in an
appalling jumble, mountains high, and
burned with a hot bronze color as they
raced overhead. A fringe of ragged grey
rain-carriers whirled with the cloud-moun-
tains, waving like a punksfti worked by
Satan. Before the Saturday-afternooners
could turn and fly the fury was upon them.
Shrieking wind, dust, rain and fragments of
ice were the principal ingredients; but there
were hundreds of others, some of them torn
off the houses. The calm came as sud-
denly as the storm. Then the ambulance
helpers went out and brought in the wounded
and the half-drowned.
A Melbourne Billjim on the other side has
been listening to Rosina Buekmann singing
Wagnerian roles, and she’s “as plump as the
plumpest songstress we know.” You may
have one guess who that is.
Letters from the U.S.A. report that Melba
is suffering badly from nerves. Her recent
stage accident and the complaints of Uncle
Sam papers that several Germans were in
her company of songbirds probably helped
to upset one who is always going at high
pressure. Nowadays she is so “jumpy” that
she thinks twice before stepping into a car.
Pianist Nellie Billings, who lately wedded
the exquisitely-gloved and accessoried .Mai
don Robb after a well-advertised courtship,
has entered on a musical teaching-partner-
ship with singer Marguerite Henderson. This
Australian soprano used to teach at the Uni-
versity Con., while the other half of the firm
has done it at Hast Melbourne. The singer
has had a considerably-travelled musical
education. Her mother used to be the best-
known Government-servant of her sex in
Victoria, with the job of leading lady at Pent-
ridge Stockade, where she did more than will
ever be known to put the State’s female
boarders back on the right track.
The panto, people are busy assuring the
Melbourne public, too, that the kiddies just
love it. In “Aladdin” the official watch has
been put on the small performers, and their
seven appearances run to only 18 minutes
altogether. For the rest of the time they’re
mostly waiting for “Mr. Bailey” to come oil’
and amuse them. There never was a boss
more popular.
When sounds of revelry by day disturbed
the quiet of Brighton in the vicinity of Vera
Pearce's villa, the Ancient Order of Wow-
sers at once had visions of a wild orgy, with
champagne magnums lying about the floor
and drunken actors trying to do the Turkey
trot on the dining-room table. What they
would have seen had they been allowed to
enter was a pack of happy and noisy
youngsters busy w T ith cream puffs, lemonade
and other indigestibles, the occasion being a
bonzer party given by Vera to the kiddies
who take part in the “Dick Whittington”
panto. Even the most blase member of the
profesh, aged 15, admitted that it was “very
enjoyable.”
Muriel Starr put on “The Easiest Way,”
her new piece, on Saturday night, and a full
house stewed gently through the show. Very
rich old Saddler deserted his club for the
evening and was stalled with a party of
womenfolk. Returned soldier Char. Crespin
(he was once a genthelp) boxed with young
De Bavay and two De Bavay flappers—one
of them in dimity-flowered silk and the other
in vivid pink. Mrs. Geoff Syme, in another
compartment, wore a twilight-purple ninon
shoulder-cape and waved a fan of real lace.
Mrs. Dearden was in the audience, which
also included the Charlie Campbells. Mrs.
Charlie wore the demurest of pink frocks.
Aide Conant, off the chain and minus the
duty lapels, sat in the stalls.
Muriel Starr has a cousin Starr on with
her in the place of Tien Hogue. The cousin
has brought some very-latest dresses from
’Murka. One is a grey velvet with the
blousy skirt hobbled into the ankles with
embroidery—-the new silhouette, my dear.
The straight shoulder-cape is another new
notion. It falls from the shoulders in a
straight line to the ankles. Muriel manages
to achieve a blase, worldly look in her
clothes by wearing a hat lined with hob-red
velvet and clothes built of furniture plush.
She wears a horrifying morning dress to her
stage breakfast. It is of rose silk patterned
like wallpaper with silver and edged with
fur and a train. The top is missing and the
“angel” ninon sleeves are apparently glued
on to her arms.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

60 chains wide and half an hour to pass would be a
mere straggling mob (B. 10/1/’18). I have seen
camps on the Tweed-side that would provide a flight
over a 10-mile stretch from sundown to milking-
time. The biggest camp of foxies is to be found at
Double Island, in the Norman River. I had the
luck to be passing the island early one morning as
the things were getting back to hang. They
attacked the ship ’and swarmed the rigtging. The
skipper in an ill-advised moment let go the whistle
and the whole colony rose as one bird or animal.
The sun was blacked out. The foxies in their wild
alarm mistook the funnel for a hollow tree, and
Martin Penn, the fireman, got the surprise of his
life, when he opened the fire-box to find roast fox
come rolling out by the score. They were being
shoved right through by the mob behind trying to
get in to camp. Then the fires went out, and we
had to drift down some miles before we could stoke
up again. This is official.

drilled remarkably well ; so I said: “The junior-
cadet training is admirable. The whole squad does
its turnings beautifully. How did you manage to
make them remember ‘left’ from ‘right,’ and so on?”
Said the bright young Australian: “I had a lot of
trouble at first with ‘left turn’ and ‘right turn’ till
I translated the terms into bullockese and used
‘Wey; whoa back!’ and ‘Gee off, there,’ for a fe.v
months.” “How did you manage ‘about turn’ ?”
“Oh, I called, ‘Gee off, there, right round!’”
* * * *
“Kawana” : You needn’t go thirsty in the
Maoriland bush, even on a range-top, if there are
rata vines about. Some years ago 1 came across a
survey party in Auckland forest country debating
as to which side of a high ridge they should descend
for the purpose of finding a creek. “What you want
to go down te gully for?” asked Tuhi, the chain-
man. “You no see te ratat” Then Tuhi, seizing
a depending vine of five- or six-inch diameter, toma-
hawked it into two-foot lengths. “Homai te billy,”
he said, and from the nearly blood-red cut ends of
the hollow vegetable he ran out a billyful of good
clean water, a trifle woody in taste but none the
worse for that. The rata vine is a good friend to the
bushman on the high tablelands, such as the Mamaku
and the Patatere, where you may bullock your swag
along for a long day’s march without striking creek
or spring.
* * * •
“Sarto”: If ever you run out of wire-
less in the bush, here’s the way to produce a call
that's always sure of a hearing. Fold the fingers of
one hand tightly over those of the other, leaving a
cavity between the palms. Bring the thumbs
together and leave a small opening between the
palms at the wrists. Bend the thumbs over and use
them for a mouthpiece, blowing through the hole
that forms between them. The wind escapes through
the opening between the palms at the wrists pro-
ducing a dull whistle. Straighten out the fingers of
the top hand, and you get a shrill, piercing sound
which can be alternated with the duller one by open-
ing and shutting the hand. This call can be heard
for a great distance. I hope the Religious Editor
doesn’t go practising it in George-street and stop the
traffic.
ZERO.
“And was it cold so far above the clouds ?”
“Cold! Why, when I struck a match to light a cigarette the flame froze solid!”
“Wandi”: Some of the orchardists at last
have recognised that birds are their best friends and
have appealed for their better protection. The work
of combating insect pests is growing yearly more
strenuous, and the cocky yells now for more birds
where the fruit grows. Formerly’, orchardists and
others were too prone to jump to the conclusion that
because birds frequented gardens they
were there to feed on the crops, whereas
many species went to feed on the insects
and scale that usually find congenial lodg-
ings on the premises. Numerous small
birds are attracted also by the suitability'
of hedges, orange and other trees for
nest-building. Some of them attack
fruit, but the damage they do in this
way is small compared with the services
they render the planter; and he is a
mean person who would begrudge his
little feathered police a few morsels of
fruit or grain in return for the good
work they do.
A CALAMITY.
GOLDSTEIN: “Vy, vy, vat's the matter, Ikey?”
LITTLE IKEY : “Come quick, Mister Goldstein-—fader's shop’s on fire, an’ fader’s fainted,
an' a policeman's pourin’ rater on him to bring his gonzcience hack.”
“Machete”: Biographers of the late
Nicholas Minister, otherwise Nicholas the Greek, have
forgotten to mention the exploit he was particularly
proud of. It happened in his more stodgy and
respectable days, when, having given up battle, black-
birding and other pastimes, he settled down to a
humdrum existence as king of the Greek pearling
colony in the Trobriand Islands. The feat in question
was the complete disorganisation of the dusky young
ladies’ sewing class at the Methodist Mission, which
disputed with Nicholas the sovereignty of those
Arcadian atolls. The young ladies of the Trobriands
appealed to Nicholas, for they were as pagan as
he, and it grieved him exceedingly, on a return from
a long cruise in other waters, to find them all
gathered safely under the wing of the “Taparora.”
Now the particular section of the Mission which
harbored the sewing-class was close to the beach of
the lagoon. Nicholas anchored his schooner just
opposite, close inshore. That afternoon he issued a
general invitation to the nobility and gentry of the
neighborhood to an At Home on board the schooner.
The Mission authorities kept a vigilant eye on the
sewing-class, but rumors floated ashore of unlimited
calico and tobacco aboard the schooner, to say noth-
ing of tinned salmon and golden syrup. Then in
the tropic dusk Nicholas slily started the first phono-
graph ever heard in the Trobriands. The schooner
sailed at daybreak for a destination unknown. The
At Home and the phonograph were still in full
swing, and the craft was dangerously overmanned
with the entire sewing-class. As Nicholas said when
he told me the yarn: “Watta t’ ’ell dose girla want
witta sew ? Dey weara nuttin’ but da pandanus
leaf, an’ mos’ time notta dat!”
» * * *
“L’Fou”: Looking backward it seems that
the man on the land has something to be thankful
for. In 1887 the badly-scared N. S. Wales Govern-
ment offered a £25,000 reward for a method of
exterminating rabbits. A Commission appointed to
sort out some 4000 applications for the bonus turned
down, among other schemes, the introduction of
disease, as chicken cholera, liver coccidia, dog
mange; also destruction by electricity; likewise the
introduction of natural enemies, including ferrets,
stoats, weasels, Siberian sables, grisons, civet cats,
lynxes, foxes, jackals, eoyottes, raptorial birds and the
larger snakes. Some indigenous beasts (Tasmanian
tigers and devils, native cats, dingoes, eaglehawks
and iguanas) were even paraded as saviours; but
lions, tigers and wolves were overlooked. Billjim
the cocky and Jimbill the rabbiter may alike bless
the caution of the Commission that kept this
menagerie at bay.
“Bareoo”: Baix-oo rot and Belyando spew
received their names from the two rivers on which,
in the early days of settlement, the troubles were
most common. When the rot was baptised, 35 years
ago, fever and ague were very prevalent also, but
the stocking of the country eradicated those plagues,
and it is doing the same thing now in the Territory
and Nor’-West Westralia. There is 85 to 90 per cent,
less rot in Queensland than there was 25 years ago.
Curiously', dark-skinned people are practically im-
mune, Ringhi being wholly so. The spew is always
with us, more particularly in prolific years when
the herbage and grass are luxuriant, and consequently
the common fly is numerous. It is raging now.
All hands in the camp where this is written have
sudden attacks, except three to whom sugar is an
abomination. They are not troubled.
RECOM-
MENDED.
FAGGSTEIN: “Note, dthere's a nice SHDRONG
cigar—deg vos so shdrong deg vouldn’t
preak indt der preasdt-pocket.”
“Jim M.” : “It must be damn lonely here
his little hut up on the King River, behind The Buff-
alo. “What do you do to kill time?” “Oh, I just
referee the dingo fights,” laughed the genial
hermit.

THE BRIDGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gimme a bridge with mosses grown,
Of good red-gum or old blue-stone.
Some blokes prefers a ’oiler log
Accommodatin’ man ’n’ dog;
Some camp fer choice behind a fence;
Some flings their drum with little sense
Among the scrub along a ridge.
Gimme a bridge.
A bridge is best in rain or sun,
’N’ well do I remember one—
A bush-built bridge, a single span
Across a creek. There’s where a man
Could get his bath when night had fled
By turnin’ over in his bed ;
Fruit rip’nin’ east, ’n’ onions west—
A bridge is best.
A frien’ly cow, whose sloppy nose
Disturbed me innereent repose,
Gave milk to me for turnips white
I pinched from Carter over-night.
I took whey with the spuds I got
From Hogan’s forty-acre plot.
Fond reckerlection circles now
That frien’ly cow.
’Ad 1 the wish for breakfast fine
Of nice fresh fish, I took me line,
’N’ while I lay, ’n’ smoked, ’n’ read
Hooked plump, long blackfish to me bed.
’Ad I for tender duck a whim,
A swarm of ducklin’s came to swim.
Grilled ducklin’ was me evenin’ dish
’Ad I the wish.
Here, as a rule, by day I’d dream,
Tucked comfor’ble along a beam.
Once Carter, drunk ’n’ sleepin’ there,
Dripped fifty shillin’s in me hair.
Them blokes what picnicked ’long the creek
The bridge’s barmy shade would seek,
And put fat bottles in to cool
Here, as a rule.
Gords envied me me paradise,
Me blest existence free from vice.
One night came floods, ’n’ I awoke
On distant hills, wet, ’omeless, broke.
Me bridge was gorn, ’n’ all in vain
I seek the perfect bridge again.
Now, lookin’ back, it’s plain to see
Gords envied me!

Performance Without Parallel.
Shearing Machinery in the Shearing Sheds
throughout Australia has been a marvel even to those who knew the
superior merits of the Cooper Machine.
Both in the work it has done in shearing unusually hard sheep, and in the record it has established for continuous use without
requiring duplicates—it is a performance without parallel in Shearing history.
Hundreds of letters are reaching us from every part of Australia, from the owner of a small 2-stand plant, to the large Contiactoi
who shear hundreds of thousands of sheep annually—testifying to the wonderful performance of Cooper Shearing machinery.
Messrs. It. A. ROONEY & CO., Contractors, of Stamford (Q’land) write: “We have just cut out at our shearing depot at Stamford,
and Mr. Goodwin advises me that the machines are a great success—he did not open one of the handpieces during the entire shearing.
Messrs. ERNEST AUSBURN & CO., Contractors, of Walgett (N.S.W.), write: “At the conclusion of another season we are more firmly
convinced that the upkeep of the Cooper machines are 75% below others.” Mr. GEORGE JAMES, of Victoria, writes : On two occasions
I shore 75 sheep, and on another 79, without changing my comb and cutter; any machine that runs as smooth and light as that will do
me.” -Mr. WM. GREEN writes from Woodstock: “Five of the machines shore 8500 sheep here without changing a single cutter pm At
Sandy Camp we shore 55.000 sheep, and at one time the expert sat on a kerosene-tin for eight days without a machine being brought to
him for attention. The Cooper is certainly a wonderful, efficient, and economical machine.”

This sectional view of the Cooper Air-cooled Handpiece illustrates its wonderfully practical and simple construction.
THE FORK is balanced on a centre bearing at point B, and driven from behind the bearing at point E, with an easy, free,
light-running motion. The Cooper Air-cooled LID and TENSION PIN is one of the greatest improvements ever made in a
handpiece. The top of the Tension Pin rests on a fixed bearing at point A, immediately over the fork bearing at point B, and
both fork and pin at point C. move back and forth in an easy sweeping motion on the crane principle, ensuring constant
pressure on the cutter in all positions. No tension-nnt bushings are used; tension -nut expanders and adjusters are never required.
The short, well-balanced driving spindle (F) runs through a short, one-piece bush (H), reducing both wear and heat to a minimum never found possible
with old-style machines carrying a spindle and bushing twice the size of that used in the Cooper.
The above are only a few of the sterling features of construction of the Cooper machines, which ar e influencing a great multitude of wool-growers and
contractors throughout Australia to fit their sheds with Cooper product.
If you have sheep to shear, and not the machines, you will require them in 1918. Now is the time to order! If immediate shipment is not desired, the
plant can be reserved until required. Let us send you our catalogue and full particulars, by return mail.

THE DARLING.
DOLLY: “Oh, George, wiiat I went through
While you were away!"
GEORGE (touched): “My own little girl!"
DOLLY : “Yes, dear —I had a perfectly dread-
ful boil on my neck."
“E.S.S.”: Our old friend the gohanna, or
lace lizard, now being turned to commercial use, is
a hard doer. I don’t think there is anj' lizard more
tenacious of life. The heart will beat for hours after
THE GEOMETRY OF LIFE.
“Ah, my dear, it’s money makes the world go
round."
“Yes, but some of it prefers to remain
square."
the reptile has been killed ; it will beat for a con-
siderable time after it has been taken out of the
body and cut in halves. At the beginning of winter
Kojurrie buries himself deep in the ground, where he
remains until spring, the thick folds of fat he
retires with keeping his strength up during the
period of hibernation. The female is a prolific egg-
layer. She digs a small hole in a sunny spot, covers
the eggs and leaves them to be incubated by the
warmth of the ground. The oil of the beast has long
been in use among bushmen, but it has only lately
been put on the market. Besides its curative pro-
perties it is excellent for machinery—for any delicate
mechanism requiring a clear, non-sticky lubricant.
As Mrs. Kojurrie lays abundantly in captivity and
is no trouble to look after, a gohanna farm ought to
be a paying proposition.
* * * *
“J.A.C.”: At Southport (Tas.) two years
ago each cow of dairyman Joe Hardy’s whole herd
unexplainably went dry within six weeks of calving.
Their health didn’t seem impaired, and the vets,
scratched in vain for a reason. The herbage was
searched and analysed without giving a clue. The
miracle was repeated the following Spring, and the
boss was about to sell up when discovery was made
that the beasts had acquired the chewing craze.
Instead of being satisfied with cocksfoot and daisies,
they spent much of their time at the beach-end of
the run chewing the leather-like stems of the bull-
kelp. They thus imbibed sufficient iodine to cause
their milk to dry off and a large percentage of them
did not prove in calf the following season. There
was a somewhat similar case in California. A trot-
ting mare had developed an allegedly incurable swell-
ing in the thyroid gland and was retired from the
track. Being turned out on a sea-coast pasture to
rear a foal she became addicted to kelp-chewing, and
this reduced the goitre sufficiently to allow of her
being again raced.
* * * *
“Try Fluke”: Mata-hari, the Jappy name
of the too-adventurous lady who was executed in
France for espionage, has, I see, been translated as
“Sunny Eyes” or something like that. It’s curious
that in Maori Mata-hari means pretty much the
same thing. Mata is eye, and hari is happy or
joyful. The coincidence is something for philologists
to brush their brains upon. There are lots of sur-
face likenesses between Jap and Maori talk, but
in the vast majority of cases I imagine the analogy
and resemblance end there. “Toko” and “maru,”
for example, are familiar words in both tongues, but
the meanings are totally different.
“D.F.”: Queer stories are told of the
origin of some of the names in North-eastern Vic-
toria. Katamatite, near Dookie, is said to have
been originally the noise made by a soused inhabi-
tant in trying to say to his wife: “Kate, am I
tight?” Peechelba, on the Ovens, where Morgan
the bushranger was killed, was originally “P.G. —
Bar,” after the first squatter, Peter Gordon, whose
brand was “P.G.” over a bar.
“Tropicus”: A quaint decoration of the
Upper Strickland River (Papua) natives is the coni-
cal hat worn only by
man-killers. It is the
badge of successful murder,
and is greatly prized. The
collection of skulls is the
whole aim of every pro-
perly-developed male, and
the sons add their little
lot to the family trophies,
until the pile becomes of
surprising proportions. The
meat made available is
utilised in the only rational
way (from the savage's
standpoint). The hat is
very like the dunce’s cap.
It is constructed of reeds
plaited on a foundation of
split rattan-cane, and is
glued to the dome with a
mixture of gums and
ochre. Once invested with
the cadey the gentle canni-
bal struts around under it
until it falls to pieces
from old age, when an-
other one is prepared and
sealed to the head with due
ceremony. The owner also
wraps himself in a curiass
to resist the pointed refer-
ences of his peevish breth-
ren. This is made of cane
studded with innumerable
seeds of the grass known
to true believers as
“Job’s Tears.” It serves
its purpose very well, and
helps to prolong the
wearer’s life, until some-
body catches him without
it, when he goes to the
oven in the natural course
of events. Another pleas-
ing custom of these people
is the wearing of dried
hands and other selected
bits of deceased humans, a
fashion item considered very saucy by the knuts.
* * * *
“Rednalananab”: Here’s an aggregate to
beat the tally of “Uclde’s” team of shearers (B.
13/12/’l7) : Hawira, 275; Manahi, 257; Thatcher,
257; Taratoa, 240 ; Kupa, 239; Raroa, 218; Maitai,
215 ; Wipere, 210 ; Major, 206 ; Teepa, 205 ; Noanoa,
200; Temple, 181. Total, 2703 sheep for 12 men;
average, 225£ per man. This performance was put
up at Loisel’s Waihau station, Poverty Bay district
(M.L.), in December. The sheep shorn were 4-tooth
and full-mouth ewes, and the actual working time
was nine hours. The runs were from 5 a.m. to 7
a.m., 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., 10.30 a.m. to noon, 1 p.m.
to 3 p.m., 3.30 p.m. to 5 p.m. Te Maori rikes te
plenty tucker when he is shearing. Hawira is an
exceptionally clean and fast barber, and is usually
the ringer. Manahi is a youth of about 20, and this
is his second season. The shearing rate this season
is 275. 6d. per 100 and food.
* * * *
“J.G.”: Re the sudden death of a Gipps-
land kangaroo, as related by “G.J.H.” (B. 27/12/’l7).
I know of two other animals snuffing out apparently
from heart failure due to fright. A few months
back a big hare was pruning the young trees in my
orchard, but as puss was not doing the job accord-
ing to textbook 1 leaped for her. She bolted down
the wire-netted garden and attempted to jump the
fence, but failed. She thereupon made a frantic
and useless effort to scramble through the mesh.
Then I was amazed to see the beast fall over and
kick its last. In a few seconds it was as dead as
pork. Another time I set a rabbit-trap in a hole
in the same fence and one evening I heard bunny
squeal. From the time I heard the cry till I
reached the trap was less than a minute, nevertheless
the intruder was dead. Yet it was hardly marked
where the trap had caught it.
“Huffin-Guffin”: Shearing records, is it?
Charley Haylock, of Harrow (Western Vic.), has
recently cut out his final shed for the season. It
is the fifty-second time he has done it —and never
a break. Aged about 75, the father of about 12
Australians and grand-dad to—well, ask him your-
self. He’ll tell you the tally proudly.
* * * *
“Leo Lear”: Yes, mallee hens’ eggs are
A 1 when not too ripe and the hen is obliging
enough to point out the most unappetising units in
her collection. Every morning she opens up the
mound to keep the sand friable or air the blankets,
and in doing so scratches the soft outer shell of the
eggs, which are placed large end up in a circle.
Thus the fewer the scratches the fresher the eggs,
and vice versa. A sanctuary for this wonderful
mound-builder has been found in the thickets of
Kangaroo Island (S.A.), and according to latest
reports the birds liberated there are thriving
wonderfully. Gorblessem, for on the mainland they
are doomed to early extinction.
“W.A.C.”: Wouldn’t accept “Barcoo’s”
invitation to afternoon tea if he made it with the
water that eucalyptus-leaves have been floating on
(B. 17/1/’IS). Anyhow, two crossed pine battens
prevent the water in a kerosene-tin spilling, and
leave the liquid sweet.
“K.”: You can have the rest of the bush
opera co. if you give me one magpie carolling or
yodelling on a fence in the early morning, I heard
Maggie’s beautifully liquid call first when I was
seven years young, and it has meant youth and per-
fect happiness to me ever since. A N. S. Wales
country storekeeper’s tame mag. welcomed me at
the door last month with a chirp and a hop, and I
asked the bosS if the bird still made the matchless
wild music. “Only when there’s a stiff wind blow-
ing,” he replied. “Then he dodges round the corner
into shelter and performs.”
* * * *
“A.G.” : I often wondered why Bluey never
joined us when we raided our khaki underwear. One
day I stalked him and saw him peel off his shirt and
hang it on a fence. Then he retired and in about
two minutes a flock of starlings swooped down and
lunched.
* * * *
“Katharos”: Charles Darwin in his
“Expressions of the Emotions in Man and Animals”
mentioned several interesting examples of expressions
of shame in monkeys. Some time ago I saw
something which very clearly showed how intense
the shame-feeling is in dogs. A number of them
were playing together, running at full speed along
the bank of a lake, when one slipped and fell into
the water. A good few people on the spot applauded
Ponto with a burst of laughter when he agiin
appeared on the bank. Disconcerted or something by
the derision, instead of joining his playmates near by
he stuck his tail between his legs and, with scowling
side glances, slunk away.
“D.F.”: This is a Riverina man’s cure
for mosquitoes. Shovel a kerosene-tin half-full of saw-
dust from the Murray pine, set it on fire and put it
near the bed. It will smoulder away all night and
scare the mosquitoes, while the smell is soothing
and sleep-provoking to the man on the bed.
HE REMEMBERED IT WAS WAR
TIME.
McKENZIE (after waking up the chemist at
2 a.m.): “I want threepenny worth of
peppermint for my indigestion."
CHEMIST: “You blithering idiot , waking me
up this hour of the morning! Why
don’t you take some hot water —do just
as well!"
McKENZIE: “Thanks verra much. I’ll go
home and try it."
THE VOICES OF THE RAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Last night, when under troubled skies
The storm went marching o'er the plain,
An elfin music seemed to rise,
A singing in the rain.
At first it seemed a prattling child
That played alone in young delight,
And then it seemed a joy gone wild
That sang unto the night.
The raindrops with their steady beat
That set the iron roof aflow
Were like a thousand little feet
That hurried to and fro.
And where the runnels gushed and streamed
And soaked the grass-roots, dry and brown,
A busy band of fairies seemed
To patter up and down.
The air was full of whisperings,
And all the teeming dark was rife
With stir and call that told of things
That woke anew to life.
And then across the darkened waste
A sudden shouting wind was hurled;
It seemed a messenger in haste
With tidings for the world.
And till across that streaming scene
The wind went rushing down the plain,
I did not guess what they might mean —
Those voices of the rain.
They said: “Farewell to drought and dearth,
To Famine, hollow-eyed and nude!”
They said; “We are the teeming Earth,
The gift of plenitude!”
They said, those voices of the rain:
“We are the flesh and blood and breath;
We are the meat, the fruit, the grain
That succor all from death l”
They said: “Wherever we may pass
The hour of plenty comes to birth ;
We spread the banquet of the grass
Around about the Earth!
“We call,” they said, “and 10, the seed
Within its mother-soil is stirred;
The seasons round ’tis ours to feed
The fruit, the tree, the bird.
“By us the petal is unfurled,
The rose in damask splendor blooms;
We fill the markets of the world,
And feed its hungry looms.”
The moon sent forth one silver ray.
The fairy voices ceased to sing;
Yet far away, and far away,
I heard thanks echoing.
For cattle lowed throughout the night
In deep content across the plain ;
And I, too, thanked, with meet delight,
The voices of the rain.

“Trav.”: There are bushrangers still in
the country. This Ned Kelly insured his
brood mare through the local agent at
Swamp Gum. Two days later the mare
foaled safely. Kelly had just killed another
neddy and burnt it, so he put in a claim
for the loss of the mare, which the agent
had never seen. His explanation of the
cremation was that the corpse was a stand-
ing invitation to all the flies of the district.
The claim went in; but the policy not hav-
ing yet been issued, the co. pleaded not
liable. But Kelly ends up with a satisfied
grin, “I got me three quid back again.”

“0.K.” supplies some more evidence that
Australia can do things when it wants to: —
Material for an interesting study in industrial
development is supplied by the Dunlop Rubber Co.’s
business in Australia. There was a Dunlop factoiv
in Melbourne nearly 20 years ago, but the imported
materials were merely “assembled” on the premises.
Later, an organiser named Kearns came from
America, bringing three foremen with him, and
then a proper start was made with the works v. hich
to-day cover seven acres and find employment, for
1500 hands. Kearns, by the way, is said to have
been a warm admirer of the Australian workman.
He reckoned him the most intelligent and alert
type he ever had to do with. The problem in those
early days was to perfect the quality of the
material; and when, some five or six years ago, S.
F. Roberts brought his American and Scotch labora-
tory experience to bear on the business, the problem
was still how to make Australian-manuiactu'red
rubber more valuable for local use than any that
could ever be dumped here. Evidently lie solved
the problem, for the Dunlop conveyor-belting has
driven imported rivals from the field and ahead}
Australia is a pretty large field. The other day the
co. supplied the Broken Hill Prop, with two lengths
that weighed 4* and tons respectively. All done
by experimenting and persistent testing. If as
much thought, patience and scientific knowledge had
been put into the Australian woollen industry as is
put into rubber-making the manufacture of this
country’s staple product would not have progressed
so lamely all these years. Crude rubber has hardly
begun to be a Commonwealth product yet. But it is
coming along nicely. Meanwhile the Dunlop Co.
imports 70 tons a month from Ceylon and the
Amazon.
To the average citizen “Dunlop ’ suggests only
tyres; but more than 1000 different sorts of rubber
goods are produced. Things that were formerly
made of some other material are now manufactured
from the milky ooze of trees, or with its aid. A
new product whereof manager Roberts seems
parentally proud is the “Kromhyd” rubber sole for
boots —a complete sole of fibrous compound. Rubber
and rubberised materials are waging commercial war
against leather all the time. As for rubber boot-
heels, the output has already touched 3$ tons in a
week. Some of the highest-grade material' produced
in the factory is shaped into cups for milking
machines; the cups need sterilising after each milk-
ing, and only the finest grade will stand that.
Rollers for wringing-machines are mighty solid-
looking goods; likewise the rubber stair-treads
which are supplanting the old slippery metal bind-
ings that have caused many a man to break his
neck. Rubber floorings are being laid where lino-
leum once served. In the home, the warehouse, the
factory, the garden, the motor-car, the tennis-court,
the bowling green—rubber is everywhere: on the
bottle of soda man mixes with the whisky, and on
the umbrella he unfurls when the rain is falling on
his rubbered coat. Yet it is well within the
memory of very young men when none of these
things were manufactured in Australia, and when,
moreover, the worthy fathers of the young men
mostly declared that such things never would or
could be satisfactorily manufactured in Australia,
owing to the climate or the Labor party, or some
other old thing.

Working Man, 38, with £290, wishes to corres-
pond with young lady, Protestant, with £lOO, or if
good milker no capital; view matrimony. , P.O.
It was somewhere round Mamaku way—or
was it Taranaki ?—that a cocky broke off
his engagement to one of the local girls
because lie had bought a milking-machine.

“Shopstrutter”: I am aware of a little
cashier girl who sits perched in a tangle of
overhead wires deftly receiving and despatch-
ing those wooden pigeons that whir to and
fro tilled with bills and cash. During one
day lately she safely handled £3OO from one
department alone. Her weekly wage is 195.,
and if she asked for another bob or two the
shade of departed Chiffon would fall on the
impalpable shirtfront of dead-and-gone Cre-
tonne, and their frockcoated successors would
retire into their private offices and shake
their heads sadly.

The charge of a hungry shark is nothing
to the rush of a hovering police court soli-
citor. When a eullud lady appeared at “the
Central,” Sydney, on a charge of selling beer
without a license, one of the practised police-
courtiers popped up and said briskly, “I
appear for the defendant, your Worship, and
ask for a remand.” By this time the police
inspector was on his feet pointing out that
the lady had not yet pleaded. “She pleads
not guilty,” retorted the prompt Gent. One,
and, the magistrate remanding her till the
following Wednesday, she was taken out.
Five minutes later, Gent. One having mean-
while left the court, the lady was brought
back by the inspector, who explained that
she insisted on pleading guilty and would
have done so before but for the Gent. One
“butting in.” At this stage the Gent. One
arrived back breathless to cast a fog of
explanation over the incident. “I was
engaged outside to appear for this woman
and plead not guilty for her, and I asked
her here ‘How are you going to plead?’ and
she said ‘Not guilty.’ ” The inspector then
wounded his feelings by saying, “You didn’t
ask her!” and the weary beak closed a bitter
debate by ordering the Gent. One to sit
down. Perhaps it hurts that sort of Gent.
One to sit down.

“Sr”: Eaglehawk (Vie.) is being taken _to
pieces and scattered over the map of Vic-
toria. If you have any excuse for living in
old Bendigo’s suburb you can hire a five-
roomed house for three bob a week, or buy
the whole outfit for 50. or 00 quid. The
homes of the “ducked” miners are being
purchased at bargain prices by the enter-
prising and carted all over the country
and re-erected. The best way to shift
a house is to call in the driver of a
traction engine and big hauling carriage at
a fiver a day. For longer trips the practice
is to take the house down in sections, dump
it in a truck and rail the lot. As
most of the homes of old Eaelehawk are
wooden, another 20 years ought to see the
mining township in the In Memoriam
column.

“Melb”: The production of mineral wool
from bluestone at Yarraville (Vic.) goes on
merrily. It is found to be good stuff for
deadening sound in buildings, insulating cool
stores, clothing boilers, and so on. It was
discovered by chayice, like lots of other
things. At Cleveland Ironworks a smelting
furnace broke down. Steam came in con-
tact with molten slag, and there was pro-
duced a white hairy substance, not unlike
short-fibred wool. The sulphur in slag was,
however, a drawback, so granite and basalt
were substituted. In its natural state basalt
is worth about 3s. 6d. a ton ; make it wool
and it is worth £l4.
# # * *
“The Pawnbroker”: I understand that
my friend Billy Hughes is to hold a great
auction sale of unredeemed pledges before he
goes to England.
* * * *
“O’Phimertv”: The Vic. train mentioned
by “D.S.” (B. 27/12/TT) as the Australian
champion for want of speed is easily beaten
in Tassy. The Tullah express, which branches?
from the Burnie-Zeehan line at Mount
Farrell, cuts out seven miles in two and a
half hours when it has good luck. When it
hasn’t and the only carriage hops off the
line, the timetable is lengthened as required.
* * * *
“The Slug”: All the thieves are not in
gaol. A Melbourne market-gardener sent
to an agent a large crate of cabbages, in
sroud condition, and received one-and-tup-
penee in reply, although the lowest market
price at the time was 4s. a dozen. It never
seems to occur to the farmer to throw in a
bob or two with his neighbors, employ a
detective and pinch the thieving agent. There
is a law to protect even the cabbage-grower
if he cares to invoke it. The same sort of
sharking, if it were detected in Stock
Exchange dealings, for instance, would have
pretty serious results for the guilty share-
broker ; and it should be as easy for the
farmer to straighten the agent if he would
only get up and face his enemy like a man.
* * * *
“Peanut”: I visited Captain Kidd, the
bootmaker, again to-day. About 18 months
ago he sold me a pair of shoes for 20s.
Three months later the same line had risen
to 235. 6d., and to-day the things cost 355.!
Though pretty credulous, I refuse to believe
the cost of production for these Australian-
made goods has increased 75 per cent, in 18
months. Here’s the inner history of a
parcel of stockings. They were purchased
in England by our firm’s buyer, and were
sold before arrival to a wholesale Sydney
house at 100 ner cent, on oiir invoice cost.
They passed along the line to one of our
toniest frill shops at. another 100 per cent,
advance on our cost price. The stockings
are now on view, and you can buy them at
a price equal to three times the original
cost; and that included manufacturer’s pro-
fit. Yes, this is a terrible w-ar, and we must
all put our shoulders to the wheel!
MELTIN’ FAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now the evening was approaching as 1 walked upon
the hill,
, ~. ’ , . . , , • , _
And the , sea and checlless a,,d the """*
wind was shrill;
Half-a-dozen kitchen boilers stood beside the half-
made load,
And the stuff inside them bubbled as the wood fires
glowed.
“Goo’ day, mate,” remarked the stoker, as 1 stood
and twirled my hat.
“Looks like rain. What are we cookin’? Oh, we’re
only meltin’ fat.”
“No, we wouldn’t do it always—not for choice, that
is to say.
But there are no blanky ’ousemaids dravvin’ blanky
army pay.
Then, 6’ course, we’re doin’ somethin’ for to win
th’ blanky war,
While th’ blanky’ politicians wag their (extra
blanky) jaw.
Strike us dead! that blanky ’Ughes now—what’s
that little beggar at?”
ksked the brown Australian Billjims as they boiled
their (blanky) fat.
It’s the men beside the boilers who will see Aus-
tralia through
When the noisy little puppets have all disappeared
from view.
It’s the silent men and honest, not the noisy men
and slim,
Who will stoke Australia’s fires when the light is
growing dim ;
And the rich fat in the boiLrs chuckles thickly
’mid the smoke,
As it boils up for Australia and the Plain Aus-
tralian Bloke.

The Inky Way.
“T. 0.1.”: Australia’s first little teetotal
rag was the Temperance Magazine, pub-
lished from the S. M. Herald office,
then in George-street. It was born on
July 1, 1837. I have the first 12 numbers.
No. 1 contains a list of subscribers. Amongst
them are some who dealt largely in liquors—
A. B. Spark (who also had a cork leg),
J, T. Smith (then in Sydney, later inn-
keeper and theatre-proprietor, and seven
times Mayor of Melbourne), T. W. Smart.
Sam Terry, the Lords, John Tawell (who
emptied a quantity of liquor into Sydney
Cove, and was later hanged in England for
murder). The motto of the magazine was
“Temperance is moderation in things inno-
cent and abstinence from things hurtful.”
It seems to have been backed by a society
whose members boosted the circulation to
4000 by mostly taking 10 copies each. Gov.
Ginns was one of its supporters. In the
issue for May, 1838, the stockholders of the
Southern District pledged themselves not to
pay wages in spirituous liquors to any person
belonging to their establishments. E. P. S.
Sturt headed the list—he was subsequently
Police Magistrate in Melbourne —and 20
others, chiefly of the Goulburn country, fol-
lowed him.
* * * *
“8.5.”: In reply to “B. J.” (B. 24/1/T8)
“The Psalm of Time” is included in “The
Song of the Stars and Other Poems,” by
Alpha Crucis, published by Cassells and
George Robertson in 1882. The author,
Robert Dudley Adams, was a Custom House
agent in Sydney and a friend of old Samuel
Bennett of the Evening News. Bennett
knew very little about poetry, but he
printed slabs of Tennysonian verse by
Adams, whom he liked. It is therefore
probable that Heaton’s father-in-law is
responsible for the absurd opinion of “The
Psalm of Time” quoted in Heaton’s olla
podrida, “The Australian Dictionary of
Dates.”
* * * *
“Kettledrum”: Ernestine Hammings, the
austere-looking young poetess from Banana-
land, has been spending a holiday in Mel-
bourne under mamma’s eye. A scribbler at
10, she began to write printable verse at
sixteen, and was discovered by that smart'
little Scot, McAr-r-r-dle, then of Brisbane
Advocate and now of Melbourne Herald,
a son-in-law of De Largie. He induced her
to bring out her verse in book-form, and it
yielded her £7O. Now 18, and with her hair
still down her back, Ernestine has been
admired by several press people to whom
her shyness and simplicity appeal. She has
made good in The Bulletin, a “Nocturne”
having headed the Queensland page, and her
work has been reviewed on the Red Page.
In work-a-day hours she is in charge of the
library in the Queensland Department of
Justice, so she is a northern parallel to our
own Barney O’Dowd.
Frank Parnall, for whom the black camel
called at Prospect (S.A.) the other day after
years of painful illness, originally came to this
country from the U.S.A., and was reckoned
one of the most scholarly of Anglican par-
sons in Australia. Incurable disease had
long kept him from active work, but
till the last week or two he hobbled pain-
fully along the inky track as leader-writer
and reviewer for the Anglican Church
Standard.
* * * * *
“Chevron”: Returning to Australia, in-
valided, after doing his bit for nearly three
years, The Bulletin’s old contributor
“Umfaan,” otherwise Lieut. George Lee,
who, leaving with the Light Horse, was
transferred to the Camel Corps in Egypt,
and was with the Artillery in some French
stunts which were tres montarde. Born in
England, he is a S’African war veteran, and,
after a mixed experience of freelance jour-
nalism, joined Melbourne Herald staff in
1014. His wife and two little sons will be
glad to have him back.
# * * *
A curious relic is to be kept henceforth
in the Register office in Adelaide. E. W.
Webb was best known as an Advertiser man
in later life, and he was editor of its weekly,
the Chronicle, when he died. But he
started in the Grenfell-street office, and a
silver watch was given him “by the Register
companionship, as a mark of their esteem.
25 December, 1858.” The part bearing the
inscription has just been dug up in a sub-
urban garden, and sent back to where it
started from GO years ago. An odd sequel
is a letter to the paper from a relative ot
Mr. Webb, who says that the watch was
left to her. and was lately stolen, though
she didn’t know it till she read about the
discovery. However, she is quite content
that what is left of it should find a home in
the Register “chapel.”
MY PAPER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My paper hates the little thief.
Its remedy too rash is—
It prints a most profound belief
In flve-and-flfty lashes.
I scan the sixth day’s supplement
With pompous writings swollen,
And find when half an hour is spent
That fully sixty-five per cent.
Of what is there is stolen.
Deceitful rascals who in town
Assail the folks bucolic
With subtle tricks to take them down,
In sermons apostolic
It whips with scorpions.. I turn,
Suffused with virtuous feeling,
Its thoughts on politics to learn—
And in the leaded lines discern
A specious kind of spieling.
More just than Solomon, more stern,
It deals out castigation
To men who tainted money earn
By vile adulteration.
Lies, prejudice, and all deceit
And spite that’s never ended
Alloy its policy effete.
My paper is a goodly sheet —
Its principles are splendid!

Anaemia
Our blood is composed of
red and white corpuscles
the red to nourish the body,
the white to fight disease. In
Anaemia—or bloodlessness—
the red corpuscles are more
or less deficient. Thus the
blood cannot provide suffi-
cient nourishment for the
body. Therefore the face
becomes white and “ pasty ”
—the eyes become dull and
“heavy”—and a feeling of
intense weariness pervades
the whole system. To over-
come Anaemia, the blood
supply needs recharging with
red corpuscles. And it is
here that
m
The Wine of Life
possesses such wonderful
power. Because, being a
blood - maker, ‘Wincarnis’
creates a wealth of new rich,
red blood, which brings the
roses back to the cheeks —
gives a sparkle to the eyes—
and surcharges the whole
body with new vitality and
new life. That is why over
10,000 Doctors recommend
‘ Wincarnis.'

DYSPEPTICS SHOULD DRINK MORE
HOT WATER.
When food lies like lead in the stomach,
and you have that uncomfortable, distended
feeling, it is because of insufficient blood
supply to the stomach, combined with acid
and food fermentation. In such cases try
the plan now followed in many hospitals
and advised by eminent specialists of taking
half a teaspoonful of bisurated magnesia in
half a glass of water as hot as you can
comfortably drink it. The hot water draws
the blood to the stomach, and the bisurated
magnesia, as any physician or chemist can
tell you, instantly neutralises the acid and
stops the food fermentation. Try this
simple plan and you will be astonished at
the immediate feeling of relief and comfort
that always follows the restoration of
the normal process of digestion.. But be
sure you ask the chemist very distinctly for
bisurated magnesia, thus avoiding confusion
with the sulphates, oxides and citrates or
bismith and magnesia mixtures which are
often unsuitable. Soldiers at the Front and
travellers who are frequently obliged to take
hasty meals poorly prepared should always
take two or three five-grain tablets of
bisurated magnesia after meals to prevent
fermentation and neutralise the acid. — Advt.

POLITICAL
POINTS
How about calling it the Ministry of
Small Stinks?
TEE OPIUM-SMOKER.
“The Paris correspondent of HUMANITE, who
recently saw the German Emperor in Berlin, says
the military clique has convinced him that Ger-
many’s situation is excellent. The Emperor believes
he will still march into London. The acceptance
of peace pourparlers by the Bolsheviks has brought
back his old dreams. "— Cable.
N. S. Wales has millions of the loan
curse coming uome to roost later in the
year; and under advice that things will be
worse before they are better the Government
is already inviting holders, practically all
outside Australia, to take 5| per cent, in-
terest instead of the old per cent, and
call it square for the time. This will mean
an addition of nearly £300,000 a year to the
interest bill on this one transaction alone.
As the “permanent and reproductive works,”
including the Jenolan Caves House crockery
and sundries, won’t earn a farthing more
simply because the rate of interest has gone
up, this means £300,000 a year more State
taxation; and there is another £55,000.000
of debt carrying 31 per cent, or less coming
due mostly within a very few years roughly
£1,250,000 more interest to pay if it all has
to be “renewed” on the present terms. Maybe
it won't all have to be renewed on those
terms; but interest isn't going to be low for
many years to come, and the State's advisers
in London are probably right in assuming
that it will soar up to 6 per cent, and past
that before it takes a turn the other way.
Still the Government goes on cheerfully pil-
ing the debt higher on the very edge of the
precipice.
Sample of the official explanation of the
last referendum as conveyed to the men in
the trenches and in training: —
Repatriation.
£22,000,000 is to be devoted to settling soldiers
on the land and another £10,000,000 on other forms
of repatriation. Now it’s up to you to see that the
slackers in Australia do come, so that you, for whom
these huge sums are to be expended, may get back
to Australia in due course and participate in the
benefits.
No wonder an indignant officer wrote asking
whether they were not being mistaken for a
gang of bushrangers!
It is 1!) years since a censure or no-confi-
dence motion was carried in the N. S. W ales
Assembly. In the circumstances Parlia-
ments of 80 or 100 members are an expen-
sive absurdity. They don’t bring 80 or 100
brains to the business of the country. They
only bring 80 or 100 recortang machines;
and the country can’t stand tne ridiculous
expense.
Recent semi-official announcement: —
The disconcerting discovery has now been made
that many of the cargoes which have left Australia,
particularly for the East, have been filtering through
to Germany, and in consequence of this leakage the
Commonwealth Government is now considering the
whole question of the exportation of shipments which
these shores. It is probable that an important
decision will be arrived at shortly.
But what could you expect '! The public has
persistently been denied any revelations that
would awaken it to consciousness of German
and pro-German agencies and influences.
Australia hears nothing, sees nothing, sus-
pects nothing.
The fine, old crusted
Argus still believes
that payment for Par-
liamentary services is
undesirable. Because
“some members who
have lost their seats
have not been able to
save anything, and
have immediately
fallen into poverty,”
gran’ma sees in that
circumstance “t h e
futility of paying for
duties which should
b e undertaken b y
those who can afford
to give a share of their
time to them.” Yes,
and when we knock off
this odious habit of
hiring journalists and
judges, and trust to
leisured gentlemen
undertaking duties
which are now per-
formed by mercen-
aries, the millennium
will be just around
the corner.
Millen, Minister for
Repatriation, told a
conference last week
that “the thing that
stands between the
land and land-settle-
ment is the capital
necessary to provide
plant and equipment.”
This is the babble of
the city agent. What
really does send the
onntry lad speeding
to the city is the fact
that, under present
conditions, the average
cocky lives a hard,
comfortless life and doesn’t average the
wages of a wharf-lumper.
Not only were things so managed that
nothing came of the Broken Hill Prop.’s
offer, made last July, to at once build four
5000 tons ships; but, according to N.S.W.
Premier Holman, speaking at the end of
January, this also happened :
On July 27 we received a letter from the Prime
Minister, asking that arrangements be made to pre-
pare slips for as many vessels as possible, the
dimensions of the vessels being 300 ft. x 46ft. x 26ft.,
and requesting information as to how many slips
could be so prepared. We forwarded on July 31 the
information thus requested, and from that day to
this we have never heard another word about it.
This, added to the failure of the Government
to do anything with the Broken Hill Prop.’s
offer, is too serious a matter to be dealt
with in a party spirit. The National Par-
liament is above Ministers, and it is Parlia-
ment’s duty, if ever it had one, to sift this
matter to the bottom and find out who was
responsible.
The Federal Prime Minister has invited
all the State Premiers except one to meet
him to consider “the whole question of coal
supply and distribution.” The exception is
Ryan, of Queensland, who represents the
greatest coal-producing State bar N. S.
Wales. Why is Ryan left out? Is that egg
of Warwick going to burst up the Federa-
tion?
All parties in South Aus.
have decided to put behind
them the temptation to re-
tain their jobs without ask-
ing the country whether it is
satisfied or not. Thus the
elections will take place at
the proper date, which is
next April. The result
must depend very much on
whether the Labor party
will have to take on its
opponents separately or
together. Liberals and
“Nationals” are holding fre-
quent meetings and have
come to the conclusion, in
most cases, that they are
prepared to swallow one
another rather than be
swallowed. Some few, how-
ever, refuse to be anybody
but themselves. Among these
is Clarence Goode, lately of
the Vaughan Ministry, who
intends to play a lone hand
for the present. Another
complication has been
brought in by the supposed
promise of a safe seat to
young Captain Blackburn,
V.C., as a direct representa-
tive of returned soldiers.
Smeaton has found his con-
science requiring him to give
up his own fairly safe seat
in favor of Blackburn, but
he will probably be accom-
modated elsewhere.
S. Australia is busy trying
to draft itself into two
political mobs: those who
are not Labor are all trying
to get into one yard, and
people who think they are
quite honest are doing their
best to jamb them in. Yet
there would be revolution in S. Australia
for certain if somebody tried to compel the
whole population to be, say, either Baptist
or Roman Carth’lic.
Another sample of the literature supplied
by the Commonwealth Government to Bill-
jim at the Front and in England:—
Upon the result of the new Referendum depends
not only the fate of the National “Win-the-War”
Government but Australia’s continued participation
in the war, for nothing is more certain than that if
the Opposition, embracing the Pro-Germans, the
1.W.W., the Sinn Feiners, and the Pacificists win,
the result will be chaos, such as exists in Russia
to-day.
Nice, pleasant way of making Billjim feel
comfortable and easy in his mind about the
missus and the children. And a nice pleasant
wav also of making J. Bull Cohen feel easy
in his mind about his little bit in Australia,
with £100.000,000 or so falling due shortly
for renewal.
When someone in the House of Reps, hap-
pened to refer to the German Pacific
colonies, Matthews, of Victoria, cut in: —
They are no use to us ; they are white elephants.
Well, better your own white elephant about
the premises than somebody else’s mad tiger.
This doesn’t look good. In Bananaland
the Federal electoral districts that gave the
heaviest vote for “Yes” at the recent Refer-
endum sent the fewest recruits to the Front
THE PEACEMAKERS.
THE BOLSHEVIK: “Madam, I bring you
greetings.”
last year. Oxley, the only division in the
State with a “Yes” majority, supplied 121
volunteers —the lowest number in the State.
Lilley, another suburb, was the next loudest
“Yes’” and it had the second lowest number
of recruits —196. Herbert, where the vote
was 5 to 3 against Yes, supplied the largest
number of recruits in the State outside Bris-
bane, its tally being 624.
The promised, or threatened, Judges Re-
tirement Bill is not included in the business
paper of the present N. S. Wales State
session. Perhaps its most pressing work was
done even before Parliament gave it birth.
A. H. Simpson having at last stood down, the
N. S. Wales Supreme Court Bench is now
almost youthful. Three of the District Court
Bench--Docker, Fitzhardinge and Industrial
Judge Heydon—-are in the 70’s, but none of
them shows any particular signs of decrepi-
tude. Murray and Rogers, who retired last
year, were both well over 70.
PIONEERS.

America has constructed docks and built 600 miles
of railway in France. Foresters were sent and saw-
mills erected and even corn planted to feed the troops.
—Statement of U.S. War Minister.
With plough and hammer and axe and saw
The pioneers cross the sea,
Where the legions of liberty slowly draw
To the place of victory.
Oh, make the railways and sow the corn,
For thus is the strength of an army born!
Lightnings shall leap from the rending guns
And the bayonets redly gleam ;
And the world shall reel to the fire that runs
And quake to the bolts that scream ;
But engines and trucks and a port to land
Are the first great need of the iron hand.
The axes that ring on the storied oak,
The furrows in brown earth free
Are part of the furbished battle-stroke
That leaps from the western sea ;
And tl|e harvest white of an August morn
Shall laugh with plenty the foe to scorn.
Westward ho! when the seas were young
Their fathers pressed their sail;
But eastward ho 1 is their war-strength flung
Lest the shames of the years prevail;
And the pioneers of the old advance
Swing back in their splendid strength to France.

actually laid down in various parts of Australia.”
—Joe Cook.
Before long we shall see —Ah, what shall we not?
The hammers at work upon rivet and bolt:
For there conies a swift end to our present dry-rot
And we’re leaping ahead with a cheer and a jolt.
We shall see, we shall see, and it won’t be too long
Ere there’s more than the wag of a jaw in the song!
Before long we shall see! It is rumored abroad
That the win-the-war party will shortly begin
To do something that plain honest folk can applaud
Beyond screaming their angry intention to win.
We shall see, we shall see, that Joe Cook and Bill
Hughes
Can contrive something better than censoring news.
Before long we shall see! There is hope in that
word,
For seeing’s believing, as all the world knows;
And hearing in cases like this is absurd,
However the hot wind of- rhetoric blows.
We shall see, we shall see! It is faith’s final test;
But we watch, and our eyes are as good as the best.
Before long we shall see! Well, it’s cheering to know
That the curtain at last on the drama will rise;
And to have the emphatic assurance of Joe
That the size of the job will delight and surprise.
We shall see, we shall see! And we linger in hope
On an island of doubt in an ocean of dope.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
In the weights for the Newmarket and
Australian Cup each list, begins with an imported
nag—Desert Gold with 9st. 131 b. in the sprint and
Camus 9st. 81b. in the long way. Speaking gener-
ally, the lady from Maoriland seems to have been
treated a bit better than the Englishman. He
would certainly have to be a considerably better
horse than he has at any time shown himself in
Australia to be to have much chance with that
weight in the Cup, whereas Desert Gold, big burden
though she lias been allotted, is left with a visible
chance. Whether the mare is to be a starter in
this race is another thing, though this page takes it
that if owner Lowry leaves her in for any time he
means business. She is a big, long-striding animal
and a quick beginner, and if she is given a run this
page would expect to hear of her being hard to beat.
Of the rest Panacre (9st. 21b.), Briseis (Bst. lib.),
Dame Acre (7st. 111 b.) and Princess Winifred (7st.)
read as well at this stage as anything- else. One
queer feature of the Newmarket Handicap is the
circumstance of Blue Bolt being called on to give
weight to Eulacre and Dame Acre. Either of them
could probably give him a good helping and a lead
home. Condition on the day, happenings at the
start, and riding are so much more important in a
race like the Newmarket than weight, that looking-
for the winner a month before on the basis ot
avoirdupois is little more than an exercise in
futility. But running down the list the writer's
eve stopped at Lord Marco, a four-year-old import
with 7st. 81b., and he wondered how the animal may
get on if everything" else is favorable.
The Australian Cup lot include a few
that are infirm and a few others who might be worth
considering in a suburban handicap if the rest were
ordinary. One astonishing thing about the weights
for this event is the continued persistence of the
handicapper in rating old Cisco as if he were still
one of the best. This time he is put within Gib. of
Green Cap, 31b. of Ulva’s Isle, and lib. of Colbert.
In addition he is counted 41b. better than Prince
Bardolph, all of which is pretty rough on Cisco.
Statistics are against the chances of top-
weights in the Australian Cup. Three nags only
since the race’s inception, 55 years ago, have carried
9st. or over to victory. These were Malua (1880).
9st. 91b.; Highborn (1892), 9st. 4lb. ; and Tartan
(1906), 9st. Gib. But seven winners have humped
more than Bst. Gib., and none of the last 15 (bar
Tartan) have carried over Bst. lib.
* * * *
Of 111 nags weighted for this year’s New-
market a couple of dozen are pommies and eight are
Maorilanders. #
On the pony courses round Sydney there
are weeks at •i stretch when the number of times the
good thing’ misses can hardly be mentioned in Israel
without provoking tears. But last Saturday was not
one of the occasions. The fixture at Victoria Park
being the only meeting in the metropolitan area
there was a big crowd on tap, and in nine races the
favorite arrived only twice. In the other seven Mo
hung* to most of what reached him. Many of him
were able to do with it, too.
# * * *
“Argus-Eyed”: At Sandown Park (Vic.)
Blue Toorie, an any-price-you-like winner, beat the
well-backed Sugelo very unexpectedly by a half-head.
Though returned at fifties the nag (a daughter of
Alavva and Belle Blue) was quoted by several ring-
men at double those odds. What was described by
the Argtjs as an “interesting incident” happened to
one of the generous layers. Ho had hooked a sport
a hundred pounds to one, when a well-known pro-
fessional punter (the names of both bookie and
backer were given) inquired the name of the long-
priced outsider. “Blue Toorie, and you’d bettei
have £3OO to £l,” was the reply. The bet was
accepted, the well-known punter drew his money,
and —nerhaps the ad. was worth it.

All along this page has insisted that, run
together, the book will heat the tote, and that having
the two institutions on the premises is without even
plausible justification. There are two reasons why
the machine must come out second-best. The first
is that Ike stands to lose something and the machine
can lose nothing. The next is that to the majority
of punters with money the attraction of odds they
can understand is a long way more powerful than the
pull of odds which they cannot even guess at until
everybody else has finished helping themselves. How
it works out can be seen by having a look at the
Anniversary Handicap, run at Randwiek. An invest-
ment of 10s. meant standing to collect this way from
the two places:—

Of course these-figures have no influence upon the
case for the totalisator or against the book. Upon
that controversy the arithmetic of particular events
has little if aiiy bearing. What the calculations on
the Anniversary and contemplation of the kind of
betting done on the machines at Randwick and subur-
ban courses do show is that the sooner the system
now in vogue is changed the better. If Ike is to
remain where he is the case for running the machine
on a 1-2-3 basis, with a single dividend on the three
placed horses, is overwhelming. If he is to go, then
the ease for continuing to do this and running
another tote for dividends on winners only would be
hard to controvert. If the State continues to take
the view that its interest in the matter begins and
ends with getting 7*per cent, from one place and a
ticket tax from the other, thing's will go from bad
to worse.
“Spreader”: In Maoriland they show the
horses’ names on the face of the machine as well as
their corresponding numbers in the racebook. Inci-
dentally they sell proportionately quite as many
racebooks at a meeting over there as are sold at
Randwick, so the fact of withholding the names and
showing only the figures—but what’s the good ! If
the Sydney clubs won’t put an end to the farce it
is time someone else did. Since the 1-2-3 business
started at the ponies half the crowd at the “pay-in”
window gets shut out every race, and only the front
rank of the mob at the “pay out” side get settled
with in time to have a punt on the next.
* * * «
A totalisator coup might have come off
with a little luck at Gosford (N.S.W.) last week.
When the animals had rushed past the judge in the
Welter Handicap, somebody informed the tote that
old Plavinius (an outsider) had won. Whereupon a
div. of £9 19s. 6d. for five bob was hoisted. The
truth was that two prads which paid less than £1
had run a dead-beat, and the outsider wasn’t in a
place. Someone noticed the error, and the machine
hauled down the div. notice just in time. It takes
many eyes to keep a look-out for sharks at some of
these country fixtures.
* * * *
“Dumps”: Ballarat Miners’ racetrack is
to say good-bye to its best-known mark. The mul-
lock-lieap which has monopolised the middle-distance
of the course ever since racing has been known in
the district is to be carted away and used for muni-
cipal purposes. The locals will benefit: they’ll be
able to watch a race from start to finish. Also the
strong-armed jockey, riding to his own “orders,” will
be in full view of the stewards all the way.

Jolm L. Sullivan was only in his sixtieth
year when he took the last count the other day; but
he had been an established institution so long that
some people might have been prepared to hear that
he was almost a hundred. John came into the
business when, quite young. He was a hefty youth
with a paralysing wallop, and by the time he reached
22 was up in the front rank, going through the oppo-
sition like a cyclone. By discovery of the k.o.
punch, he was for nearly 15 years invincible, and he
earned a fame that was world-wide. His two
greatest battles, in the sense of being the longest,
were fought under the brutal old p.r. rules, one with
Charlie Mitchell at Chantilly (France) going 39
rounds, and the other with Jake Kilrain, at New
Orleans, 75 rounds. The last of any importance was
with Jim Corbett, when Sullivan was 34. James
won on the 21st collision. Twenty-odd years ago
John was brought to Australia by the MaeMahons
and appeared in drama. The trip was a fiasco,
mainly because of the impossibility of inducing Sul-
livan not to keep himself full of ink. The stories
of his excesses would fill a book. For many years
he earned an enormous income and fooled it practi-
cally all away. Of late the old man had toiled on
his farm and taken a front seat on the water-
waggon. As a • denunciator of booze and earnest
advocate of sobriety in all things John addressed
himself to the rising generation as one who knew
of what he spoke. He was an Irish-American, born
at Boston, stood sft. lOJin., and was a man of
exceptional vitality and not wholly without character.
There were two men whom John L. dodged getting
into the ring with—Peter Jackson and Frank Slavin.
It is not likely the big fellow was afraid of either,
but he knew enough about J;hem to be certain that
he would have to be at his best, and just then train-
ing was something he had come to think of with
horror. Towards the end he never trained at all, and"
was only induced to meet Corbett through being made
to believe that Janies couldn’t hit hard enough to
hurt. Wherefore he went down—and out. It is a
moral certainty that had he been anywhere near
form Sullivan could have eaten Corbett; but the
younger man’s left stabbed him to pieces, and in
the later rounds John was just a lump of demoralised
blubber. But he took the lacing wonderfully well.
He. turned himself into a hog; but really John L.
was a bigger man than most of them who make a
profession of bash.
Sydney Stadium, like the Coliseum at
Rome, is up against it, and to meet the situa-
tion will in future only carry on business when
the proceedings seem worth while. The slide has
lasted a year or more, and as it is very obviously
going to continue, the promoters have acted with
great wisdom. Continuation of the struggle would
merely have meant crabbing the business beyond
redemption. When the travelling pug can arrive
with an extensive entourage and a loud noise and
excitement once more prevails as to whether Mick
can trim Joe, then the moment will be ripe for the
Stadium to again receive the multitude. Heaven
knows when that will be, though.
“0.K.”: Jonel Sullivan was a lucky
bounder. Any average citizen, with half the thirst
of John L. and equal means of satisfying it, has to
get buried at a much earlier age. He was the first
of the spoilt darlings of the stoush cranks who have
money to burn in the cause of the Ignoble Art, and
he remained an idol even after he had started the
fashion of drawing the color line by funking a
meeting with Peter Jackson.
Bill Beach will be 08 next time he has a
birthday, and he says he never felt better. The yarn
about athletics being a quick method of exhaustion gets
a bad ad. from Bill, for he did things in a hurry.
When he went to England he met and defeated five of
the best scullers in the world in three weeks. Three of
the contests were decided within one week. He rowed
seven times for the cnampionship of the world, and
was never beaten. The first wager he ever made was
at Kelso, near Bathurst, when he cued a wild bullock
for a barrel of beer. The old champion attributes
his success as a sculler firstly to his strong physique,
secondly to the muscular training he received at his
father’s anvil when a lad, and thirdly to perfect
training by Tommy Kelly. He has been living in
quiet retirement at Dapto for about 14 years.
The Hobart Regatta has been “wet”
afloat and ashore for 79 years; but the land part of
the 80th anniversary the other day was “dry.” When
the five booths were put up to auction the secretary
of the Temperance Alliance bought the lot for £5O,
and the thirsty souls without a private stock could
not get beyond ginger-beer and lemonade.
“Iverani”; It happened somewhere in
London. A burly Anzac had fallen foul of a crowd
of Tommies and was giving them his terrible opinion
of them. 1 thought he had conveyed it very lucidly,
but he seemed to think it needed illustration. “Look
’ere,” he said, with that withering contempt which
only beer can supply, “a man ’d feel a bit of a
to take on only a couple of you. What about three
of you ’avin’ a go?”

The once-famous racing yacht Casco, in
which R. L. Stevenson left ’Frisco about 30 years
ago for the Southern Seas, has been rehabilitated for
trading in the Pacific. She was built in Cali-
fornia, is a top-sail schooner, 95ft. long and 70 tons
burden. About 10 years ago she was laid up at
Victoria, 8.C., and three years later was pressed
into service long enough to transport a cargo of
junk to Vancouver. Latterly she has been used
as a training ship.

“Try Fluke” : Tom Jackson, the last living
of the old-time whalers of Kaikoura, who pulled his
first oar in a six-thwart whaleboat just 60 years
ago, is the doyen of M.L. authorities on sharks and
shark-lore. When he was a-whaling at Te Awaiti—
“old Tarwhite” —-in Queen Charlotte Sound, where
his father settled nearly 90 years ago, he slaughtered
all the sharks he could lay lance to, for the sake of
the liver oil. “Me noble shark,” he says, “gave us
all the light we needed in Tarwhite in the old times
—no kerosene then. We hung the livers up in a tree
to ripen and then squeezed them out and they gave a
first-rate oil. And there were sharks in those (lays—
-18-foot taniwhas, savage brutes wlio’d take a boat
between their jaws and shake it. That’s what one
big fellpw did to my old boat the Swiftsure one day
when I harpooned him —-turned on his belly and took
the bow of the boat in his mouth. I heard some-
thing crunching and smashing, and, thinks I, it’s all
up with the old Swiftsure, but the bows were too
wide for him to close his jaw on, and the breaking
sound that I heard was the crackling of the scoun-
drel’s teeth. He left three of them in the planks as
a memento, and we had to saw ’em off smooth. But
somehow these days the sharks don’t seem to grow l
so big—same as the peaches, nothing like the boomers
of the old days, me son!”
In a recent match it was not the fault of
Georgeson, of South Brisbane, that the Toowong team
accumulated 64 runs, lie took nine wickets for 36
and caught the other.

G. .1. Neill (Sydney), who took six for 28
against Petersham on Saturday, is a new all-rounder
in premiership cricket. His best in three matches is
top-score (41) against Western Suburbs. Another
to put in good work in the mud was R. B. Minnett
(Middle Harbor), who piled up 37 (out of 82)
and took five wickets for 40 against Western Suburbs.
R.B. is one of three brothers (R.V. and L.A. are
the others) who have plaved for Ma in inter-State
cricket. After R. B. Minnett had taken “most
wickets” for ’Varsity in ’O7-8, he dropped out; but
in ’l4-15, he averaged 38.50 and took 32 wickets
worth 18.00 each. This season his 23 wickets have
averaged 13.52.
* * * *
Of 22 batsmen sent to the pavilion in the
’Varsity-North Sydney match on Saturday, not one
was bowled. Twenty were caught, one was stumped
and the remainder had thoughtfully put a leg in the
wrong place.

Back for a spell in Australia, Private Billy
Kelly, the greatest of Sydney Rugby League five-
eighths. Kelly picked up the game in Maoriland,
where he played with Wellington in Union rep. games.
Afterwards he pulled on the League jersey for Wel-
lington and Maoriland. In Sydney he captained
Balmain to victory in the Rugby League premier-
ship, and also helped the Ma State in rep. matches.
Kelly is one of the buttresses of Northern Union
Rugby at this end of the globe.

“Arthur R.”: Alf Baud, the popular
skipper of the Carltons, is probably finished for
active service. A few months ago he was reported
slightly wounded; but his skull proved to be more
seriously damaged than was thought, necessitating
an operation and the young footballer’s return to
Australia.
* * * *
“S.T.S.”: Australian authors may not be
specially popular in London, but at any rate they
don’t have to disguise their work to get it printed.
Almost every cheap English magazine nowadays
contains a story written in America, but carefully
transplanted on to English soil. You can always
tell the American touch, somehow. Sometimes an
oversight gives it away fatally, as in one in a
recent Strand, where “United States” has been
carefully translated into “United Kingdom,” stars-
and-stripes into Union Jack, and so on, and the
truth only leaks out in a casual reference to foot-
ball. The hero had been a Cambridge University
crack, and there, “playing right-forward” in an
“eleven,” he had “bucked his way right through the
whole line, 60 yards for a touchdown”—which is
neither Rugby nor Soccer, but just the American
college game.
Sydney High School athletics owe much
to Cyril P. Scnrader, whose broad shoulders never
weary of work which will help -Young Australia.
Five days of the week he keeps an eye on the
cricket of Technical High School lads; on Saturday
with Frank Iredale, M. A. Noble and other enthu-
siasts he points the way to schoolboys practising on
Svdney Cricket Ground. Tennis, baseball and soccer
football take up other spare moments through the
year; and at the High School athletic championships
the programme runs smoothly under his care.
Schrader, an M.A. of Sydney ’Varsity, is one of the
masters of Sydnev Technical College.

“Montalex”: In my part of the world,
when a badger was caught, lie was generally
“piped”; the pipe being a narrow trench about
7yds. long, roofed over with boards and soil.
Liberated into this, the “brock” betook himself to
the end, and there dug himself in by raising a
barrier of earth that left above it an opening for
only his biting department. Then dog after dog
would be sent in to try to draw him. I have never
known a fox-terrier succeed. _ Game enough certainly
the dogs were, and wouldn’t cry-off till they were
seriously mauled. But the job was beyond them.
Finally an experienced bull-terrier would be put on
the scent. Even then, it would be sometimes 15 or 20
minutes before —fearfully cut-up himself —he could
drag forth the prisoner. If he came out alone, and
sat down to lick his wounds, it meant that the badger
was dead meat.
“G.L.H.”: “Ranger” (B. 17/1/’18) says
that using a rifle-sling on mounds does not spoil a
man for shooting in the field. His experience does
not tally with that of the bush club I am a member
of. We have several first-class wallaby-shooters as
members, and they are all blobs on the mounds, using
a sling. On the 'other hand, in the scrub none of
the good target-shooters have a hope against them.
What else could be expected? A rifleclubman is
taught to tie himself down in a position impossible
in the bush and given two sighter shots. Hut
make him do without his sigliters and where is he?
His first shot will be a miss every time. The wal-
laby-shooter has to know his rifle and get his first
shot home, either kneeling or standing. If he misses
with his first, he is out of it. I have done well
myself at the target; but, like all rifleclub-
men, I must have sigliters and know where
each individual shot strikes, or I am lost. If club-
men were forced to do without that farce, sigliters.
and their shots were not signalled until firing finished,
we should have some exalted rifle shots. When
“Ranger” talks about the mound expenses that his
crowd paid out of the foxes they shot, I come at
him. When next in Sydney, if “Ranger” likes, [
will lay him £1 to 10s. for 50 shots, or anv num-
ber, against his hitting the bull at 500yds. kneeling
or standing without sling. Every bull, I will pay
out £1 ; every other shot he pays me 10s. The
500yds. target is the easiest of all the ranges, so
that, on his talk, he ought to do well.

For a North Sydney team at Chatswood
on Anniversary Day retired police-sergeant Aber-
crombie scored 50 in 14 shots at 000 yards. But he
will do better vet: he is at present a mere youth
of 88.

It looks as if the much-boomed synthetic
rubber has failed as a substitute for the real article
in Germany. Fritz was forced to attempt the imita-
tion by his failure to replenish his stock of natural
rubber, though for some months after the beginning
of the war he was getting heaps of the stuff through
holes in the blockade. At present he is keeping his
real maekay for staff ears and is fitting many essen-
tial war vehicles w r ith iron and wood tyres, which
means a serious loss in speed and efficiency. Motor
trucks formerly capable of 12 miles an hour now get
an Iron Cross if they can manage ten.

Prestige
* can t fool all of them for very long. That is why some
products flash into view and are as quickly lost in obscurity.
Indian prestige is no mushroom growth. Indian experience
and development date from the birth of the motor-cycle industry.
Indian has always been the first to introduce and standardise the
big fundamental improvements in construction and design.
. Indian is the largest and most complete motor-cycle organis-
ation in the world—its size and capital ($ 12,500,000) give it the
power to command the world’s best motor-cycle brains.
These are our grounds for stating that, if there’s a better
motor-cycle coming, it will be an “ Indian.”

But when the eye has run down the “Profits”
column, switch it over to the “Written Oil.”
Then it will he seen that during the past
three years, though there is no reason to
suspect the management of having suddenly
gone gay, no visible appropriation has been
made to cover depreciation. Instead, nowa-
days, profit is shown only after provision
has been made “for repairs, renewals, taxa-
tion and sundry contingencies.” The mod-
esty of some of these patriots is surprising.-
Before the war this co., for instance, was
able to put by 15 or 20 thousand a year
towards renewals. Since the war it has been
so eager to help the Allies that it has been
barely making ends meet; but it is suppress-
ing all mention of its own privations in order
not to make the Allies feel uncomfortable.
However, though the Maoriland Government
was very slow in getting off the mark, it has
a nice, serviceable little income tax in opera-
tion now, which apparently will bite Ts. (Id.
in the £ out of tile bulk of the profit of this
co.
The look of the accounts has been much
altered by the shortage of shipping: meat
and wool.' wanted by the British Government
whenever they can be got, have been piling
up in Maoriland, and extra store accommo-
dation has been in urgent demand. “Build-
ing operations at Islington, Smithfield,
Pukeuri and Burnside are being undertaken
to cope with the requirements of the season
now commencing.” To finance the building
campaign further capital has been got in. the
unissued shares being sent out at a 50 p.c.
premium ; while special advances have been
made by the bank against stocks of wool
and meat held on account of the British
Government ( £603,0051. The following table
shows the more important changes: —
1907. 1915. 1916. 1917.
Capital .. £168,399 £173,254 £173,254 £258,130

Liquid assets. . 126,751 542,587 564,641 1,061,552
Capital is now £300.000 in 20,000 shares of
£lO (of which 90S were issued during the
; ear) and 25,000 of £4 (of which 13,280
were lately issued) ; but there are still some
calls to be paid. In 10 years, though the
dividend has averaged slightly over 10 p.c..
approximately only one-third of the profit
has been divided, and approximately equal
amounts have been put to reserves and laid
by to provide for renewals, etc. On the 10
years, therefore, the net profit has averaged
approximately 20 p.c., and the provision for
renlacement. etc., appears to have been ex-
ceedingly liberal. It seems safe to say that
for the past three years of war the figures
are vastly better even than that.

In continuing to pay 10 p.c. this mortgage
co. is sailing very close to the wind. If
you don’t include the £5OO added during the
past year to Contingent Securities Depreci-
ation Fund, the profit left over after paying
the dividend was only £124. The gradual
shrinkage of profits since 1913 has bee_n
mainly due to increasing taxation —1915,
£900; 1916, £1433; 1917, £2968. And for
the current year the income tax, at any
rate, will no doubt be still more. In the
circumstances the directors might have been
expected to be a bit chary about making
advances; but apparently they don’t regard
the future as uncertain. At any rate, as
the next table shows, they are still, adding
to their advances :
1905. 1910. 1915. 1917.

Liquid . . 3,963 10,383 21,003 42,577
Liabilities consist principally—almost wholly
—of deposits; and unless that money is
secured over a long period the management
is liable to have some worrying times in the
future. Incidentally the co. has the unusual
habit of changing its chairman every year
and making him managing director —
Harold Beauchamp in 1915, Balcombe Brown
in 1916. G. M. Kebbell in the past year; all
experienced men, certainly, and with a good
financial pull. In one respect, no doubt,
Maoriland can look ahead with more confi-
dence than Australia. The Dominion farmer
doesn’t depend upon wheat to a great ex-
tent, and it doesn’t take a fleet of ships to
carry away a million tons worth of wheat
and wool. All the same, there is a tremen-
dous bill to pay; and Maoriland will be
paying it long after it has ceased to get war
prices for its products. And if that doesn't
affect the value of such securities as this co.

Name and address must appear on the MSS. No
liability is undertaken re contributions volun-
tarily submitted; and no MS. will be returned
unless stamps accompany.
Helen Blazes; Couldn’t you put it all in
a page ? Haven’t got time for jokes that run to
eight or 10 sheets S.: Very nearly ran into a
place.... Noek: No use. Hasn’t a thousand to one
chance of getting past the Censor S.W.P.: Yarn
hasn’t much color and goes rather conventionally.
W.H.: Must go back A.H.: “Diary is
heavy fooling... .R.K.: Not up... .W.H.M.: There s
sense in that: —
Stop your clamor, stop your jaw,
Take a hammer, take a saw,
Get some boards and some nails,
I’ll find the wind to fill the sails.
... .E.G.; No interest... .Drummer: Not convincing,
though smart in spots.... Pitta: Too long for in-
terest. .. .R.G.B.: Not our style. .. .M.L.: Nothing in
it G.W.: “Somme Sport” doesn’t go Red
Lodge: Not up.... Padre: You don’t protest against
prudery; you emphasise it E.M.: One, may do.
....Blank: “Revolution in Germany” says nothing
new. Put your name on your copy. A covering
letter is liable to be detached Iphigenia: Yes,
there’s hope ; but blank verse is not a good medium.
.. . . J.IT.: Sonnets are a bit stiff. “Ship of Dawn
held for inquest E.G.: “Johnson” doesn't move
us. .. . J.D.S.: Wants more skill J.E.: Don’t care
for them M.M.: The “Flapper” won't do; the
other is on the border... .N.T.: This isn’t a nursery
paper.... Iiranskopf: No special thrill in it; but.
good feeling is good feeling whatever the merits of
the writing.... M. B.: “Guilty” of a very crude
attempt.... G.lt.M.: Not good enough... .Scotia: No.
....BAY.: None of them; though an “ ’Ollow Cry”
is very nearly.... Condorrie: Looks like a first
attempt. No reason why there shouldn't be a second.
....No name: That “Wright-Wrong” juggle of words
takes first prize for stolid stupidity.... Derwentside:
Well, it’s a rather dismal slab.... W.T.; The “Re-
cluse” says nothing at all....H.E.; The “Hughesiad’
is lame stuff making elephantine efforts after mirth.
... .E.V.M.lv.: Weak commonplace... .A. C.: No....
V.M.: “Boys of A.I.F.” doesn’t contain a new idea
nor an old one freshly stated. .. .L.G.: Try something
that gives you scope for feeling'. “Memory” ought
to play with something better than grass and flowers.
. ...G.L.: “Singing Sands” must go back.... Black
Hawk: The 21st fails like the rest. You’ll have to
make it something better than “slop” before you
score... . V.L.S.: Might have made a small paragraph.
We’re always looking for small paragraphs....
J.L.R.: Seems the same thin noise in longer lines.
. ...E.M.E.: The suggestion of lines somebody else
wrote to a “Queensland Opal” spoils it....B.C.:
“The Parson” goes back. .. .B.C. (M.L.) : There’s
too much scream, but the yarn has some power. . . .
F.R.: Not nearly up.... C.J.II.: The person who
begins a yarn, “The exigencies of life have at times
rather exacting tendencies” doesn’t really want it
published. He is only getting some of the inherent
vice out of his nature....No Name: “Denunciation”
is a mere pen of words... .Fernleaf: A good enough
subject, but the verse is not... .D.W.: Nothing there.
. ...Kridd: Too long for its interest... .H.T.: “The
Seer” looks a little hysterical.... Rufus: Verse too
rugged. .. .J.H.C.: Weak spot in the “bagpipes”
narrative is that there wasn’t any Turkey in exist-
ence 3000 years ago. ...L.I.: No freshness or
novelty about those “cries”... .N.C.: “Sonnet” no
good.... Digger: Nice feeling, but a bit too rugged.
... .C.P.M.: Moral tale in loose verse. If one or the
other has to be loose, make it the morals. . . .L.D.M.:
Rather too mad.... A.G.M.: No use...-M.F.: No joy
in it. ... I.O.G.: You won't make gjood verse by
choosing a simple theme and then stringing every
commonplace phrase and idea you can upon it....
E.R.: Not in this paper... .L.D.: “Memory” hasn’t
enough in it....N.J.; Not up. .. .S.J.B.: It won’t
do....F.J.; Coming all the way from Peshawar,
“The Empire’s Sons” should get a hearing:—
England, how glorious is thy name,
Whose fight for honor is Freedom’s gain;
From times' immemorial thou has reigned,
For Liberty’s cause; to-day mankind’s saviour
again.
Thy sons and daughters in every sphere
Fight amidst pain, for all they hold dear;
The Bull-dog breed still exists ;
Restoration must be made ere you desist ;
In Duty’s call thy clarion ring
Glory to our glorious Empire they bring.
. ...A.G.J.: “France” verses are good; but you don’t
keep the sonnet form. Why not revise and avoid such
shocking rhymes as “conqueror” and “war” ?....
J.M.: Not quite up... ./Willoughby: Not our style.
N.C.: “Sonnet” no value A.W.: No, it’s
“Scarcely Probable” ; but you had a dainty bit of
insanity there if you had handled it. Try again.
P.L.B.: None quite up L.L.D.: Poor kind of
idea... .M.S.: What exactly do you mean by saying
we are “worse than dead”? In fact, what exactly
do you mean by any of it?... .F.C.F.: “Mem’ries”
don’t rise to sufficient heights Yannatherra:
Rather crude Gertrude E.: If you can get those
figures it will make a good par.; write again....
W.H.C. (France) : No use sending it to us if you
have already sent it to others... .1. Say: Quite cor-
rect ; other was first in Austin D.: Can’t read
the faint pencil... .Cobber: There ought to be a good
story in that gun; get on to it Mac: Think you
misread the proud father. He merely pointed "out
the disparity between the country medico’s mileage
charge (10s. 6d.) and what the garage people find
profitable (Is.). There is no suggestion in his par.
that he would have jibbed at a moderate professional
fee Son of the Marsh: Thanks. But what is
there to reply to? On that matter this paper stands
where it has always stood—for universal service. It
stands where the Labor party used to stand and where
it will stand again before it is many years older.
Either that or the Labor party will see one of its
most-treasured planks go overboard and the white
laborer will bow his neck to a competition that will
make wreck of most of his social ideals.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
G.E.K.: Perspective is your main trouble. But
you have others. One of them is oldgagitis
Falkshaw: Don’t care for your tapestry design....
A.M.II.: Dull both ways K.U.F.: Not well enough
drawn C.E..J.: Both going home R.C.E.:
Unsuitable J.E.W.: Try one of those kind religious
papers that love to jump on the other saint’s hat....
V.P.S.: Aunt Kate is flat. So is the girl L.G.:
You did the drawings yourself. But you must have
gone to the Mitchell Library to get the gags....
J.E.T.: Why isn't the dog running? The fat man
will catch him in a year or two if he doesn't move.
. ...G.A.L.: Decent beginner’s stuff.

Look to Your Teetk.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.
EUDENTA TOOTH PASTE is scientifi-
cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect
the mouth (thus preventing decay).
EUDENTA is therefore regarded as “the
perfection of dental luxuries.” 1/- tube every-

The NEW EDISON
a wonderful instrument.
The very latest model of The NEW EDISON
is illustrated, and it certainly merits the
attention of every lover of REAL music.
Though moderate in price it has exactly
the same marvellous fidelity as the larger in-
struments which astounded world-famed
critics by re-creating music that could not
be distinguished from the original rendering.

“The Immature Male”: In a current show
which critics agree is made by its chorus,
120 dear things (more or less) are sweated
nightly. The girl who desired to shine in
this particular frivolity had first to put in
four weeks’ strenuous work for nothing,
rehearsing mornings, afternoons and some-
times evenings, week days and Sundays, fre
quently through meal hours, and at all times
in a thick atmosphere. Then, if she passed
the weeding-out process as regards legs,
voice and general appearance, she was
engaged at £1 12s. 6d. per week—a few bob
more than Main Mary Annette gets with, her
keep. The girls’ week includes six evening
performances, two matinees and numerous
rehearsals —and a rehearsal is frequently
called between a matinde and the even-
ing show. Extra matindes are not
paid _ for, and the producer and his
satellites have the almost magisterial
power to further reduce the wretched 325. 6d.
by inflicting a, series of petty fines (minimum
55.) for such trivial “offences” as mistakes
made through nervousness. Imagine how
fatally easy it is for a jaded girl to get mixed
in the complicated and frequently idiotic
“business” invented by ballet mistresses and
others! Heaven only knows how they
memorise all the rot they have to do.

that the panto,

they do on the

the question.

Melbourne lovers of the literary drama

Gregan McMahon hopes to provide perform-
ances every two months. Gabriele D’An-
nunzio’s “Gioconda,” Brieux’s “The Three
Daughters of M. Dupont,” and Anatole
France’s “The Man Who Married a Dumb

mised. together with helpings of Galsworthy,

lie made a bad start in a theatre he had
taken on a four weeks’ lease, and, apparently,
could not recover.
“A.” : Tenor Walter Kirby passes around
a letter from II. D. McIntosh offering him
£100 a week to lift his fruity voice and
doubled-barrelled chin on the Tivoli circuit.
Walter says his fee. is £25 a performance,
and publicly scorns Mac’s offer. Just as
well, perhaps. In the old days of dinkum
variety shows, at any rate, the gallery would
have made nasty noises if Walter had ap-
peared on the scene.
“H.O.”: Despite many episodes of the
“Willow Tree” sort, the curtain lias very
rarely been rung down before the finish of a
performance. It was done in Melbourne at
the old Opera House many years ago,
when Mrs. Bernard Beere was appear-
ing in “Fedora.” On this occasion,
though, the trouble came not from the
auditorium, but from the stage. The
gentleman with whom Mrs. Beere was
playing was well sozzled, and in the
middle of a big emotional scene lie flopped
down upon a couch. The actress for a moment
looked appealingly towards the audience. “I
can’t go on,” she exclaimed despairingly, and
burst into tears; so down came the rag.
Bram Stoker, in his biography of Irving,
“The Bing Boys," at
Sydney Majesty's.
The Keeper of Lions
(Clyde Cook).
relates that one
night, when “Ham-
let” was the bill,
Irving, as soon as
be faced Polonius
realised that the
mummer was
screwed. S’renry at
once gave the sign
to send down the
curtain, and made
a breif, dignified
speech to the
house, announcing
that the play would
be proceeded with
as soon as a slight
rearrangement of
the cast had been
effected. A “re-
arrangement of the
cast” after the
performance had
started took place
at Melbourne Prin-
cess’s on the open-
ing night of a
revival of an old
play about a year
ago. There was a
nice derangement
of epithets in the
earlier scenes, and
for the second half of the play the part was
read by a lady cast for a minor character.
It was at Sydney Cri. that George Rig-
nold was given a rough passage by a few
galleryites while playing in “The Three Mus-
keteers.” Annoyed bv one of the interrupt-
ers, somebody shouted: “Put him out!”
“Blanky good idea !” commented George from
the stage, and went on with his lines. Shortly
after the leading Sydney and Melbourne
theatres had reduced the price of gallery
seats to a “zaek,” George was guyed by a
sixpenny crowd at Sydney Majesty’s. Rig-
nold paused, advanced to the footlights and
announced briefly: ' To-morrow night and
thereafter, one shiling.”
“0.K.”: Ivathlene Macdonell’s outburst is
another reminder that mummers make an
egotistical practice of claiming consideration
for themselves quite apart from the charac-
ters they play. When the part is effective
the performer laps up all the applause and
sweet criticism on the strength of having
acted it. When it is silly, the hired expo-
nent bitterly resents the ridicule due to the
part. A mummeress in a silly character has
no right to immunity from the annoyance of
laughter. She takes a sporting risk of being
absurdly circumstanced when she takes a
star part in an untried piece. She can blame
the management, or the author, if she likes, for
the tittering of the gallery girls who are
ordinarily her perfervid adorers. She shouldn t
blame the titterers. But women mummers
are not much worse than males where guy-
ing is concerned. An actor is very apt to
make an object of himself in such cases as
soon as he thinks himself of sufficient import-
ance to be able to show temper on the stage.
An obscure mummer must suffer in nervous
silence, but a leading man may walk up to
the footlights and protest against the audi-
ence's sense of humor. Audiences have little
enough sense of humor, God knows! The
business of mummers is to bluff them into
the belief that bathos is pathos, cheap tricks
and mannerisms poetically emotional, and a
bit of ranting a masterpiece of dramatic
passion. Once in a way the bluff doesn’t
come off’, and then the bluffer curses the
public’s lack of gullibility. What educated
theatre-goers complain of is that the public
doesn’t greet all silly plays with derision, and
thus raise dramatic entertainment to a
respectable level.

“S.S.”: It re-
quires a lot of
nerve in a pro. to
stand up before a
guying audience
and pretend not to
notice it. Gus
Glover once got
“the bird” at the
old Alexandra, Mel-
bourne. Gus had a
tremendous voice.
He let it go. The
malcontents hissed
% little louder. Gus
went one better.
The hubbub in the
pit increased, and
G 1 o v e r’s roar
nearly lifted the
roof. Gus won,
silence fell. Then
entered the “poor
old man,” holding
a flickering candle
over his head, and
q u aver ing : “I
thought I heard a
voice.” Down came
the house. Another
old pro., Cathcart.
awakened objec-
tions in a section
of a Royal audience. It boo-hooed for
three minutes; then Cathcart, speaking
nicely across the footlights: “You who
object to me may say what you please.
I am less fortunately situated —my objec-
tion to you is unspeakable.” At the
Pinafore, Tasmania, a variety co. from
Launceston contained a basso profund
whose Mephistophelean uproar moved the
miners to contempt. Basso tried again
and again, but was silenced with yells of
derision. At last he ceased liis efforts to sing.
Stepping out on the roof of the piano, he
shook a fist like a ham at the audience.
“Perhaps I can sing grand opera,” he said.
“Perhaps I can’t. But I’ll tell you what —
I’ll fight any eight-stone man in this audi-
ence for £10!” Basso weighed 15 stone if
he scaled an ounce !
“75” : At the fourth time of offering, actor
Teddy Landor has been accepted for khaki.
Edward revealed a quaint vein of humor in
“The Glad Eye,” and scored several Shaks-
perian successes with Allan Wilkie, notably
as clown in “Twelfth Night.”
“First Old Man”: The Demon King in
pantomime is a devilish infliction, as a rule.
The only exception I can recall is provided
by the King Rat of this season’s “Dick Whit-
tington.” lie carries off the mumming honors
of the show —gives full weight to every word
he utters, and by real acting ability evolves
a character as interesting as any in the
cast. Ilis singing, too. is that of an artist,
and he goes through his job (not the most
thankful one in the world) to his own evi-
dent enjoyment. Any “Poverty Pointer”
seen a better?
“Frank J.,” from the footlights in France:
I can settle the Ko Ivo argument. Ko Ko was
intended by Gilbert to be a little, insignificant,
jrmped-up buffoon. My authority is Richard
Wethersby, producer of the G. and S. operas in
Australia a few years ago, and Charles Whalen, who
played the part, both men trained by Gilbert him-
self. The Howard Vernon type was quite wrong.
Tradition was a fetish with old Dick Wethersby.
Not a departure from what Gilbert originally pro-
duced in score, libretto and business would he per-
mit. I was a member of the co. and recall
having trouble because I one day so violated “tra-
dish” in “Pirates” as to chew the tassel of my
cap, which made some people in the audience laugh
and old Dick roar like a bull, “Hark at ’em!” His
idea was that they should have thrown the theatre at
me.
“Glen Huntly”: Watching Barry Lupino,
as Clown in the “Aladdin” harlequinade at
Melbourne King’s, tickle the policeman's
seat of humor with a red-hot. poker, re-
minded me that 60 years ago, at Edinburgh,
Lupino’s grandfather paid a similar delicate
attention to S’renry Irving, who on that
occasion was the bobby.
“Iv.” : Peter Dawson, the virile Australian
baritone who looks like a fighter and sings
like a seraph, is the most satisfying star
H. D. Mclntosh has rolled on to the Rickards
circuit. He has none of the airs or graces
of the big artist, isn’t foolishly lavish with
encores, and has a charmingly natural plat-
form manner which is almost big-brotherly.
The other night, at Sydney Tivoli, somebody
asked for “The Floral Dance.” “I’m sorry,
I don’t think I’ve got that one,” said Peter,
turning over his songs. “But I’ll tell you
what I'll do. I’ll send out for it and sing
you something else while we’re waiting.”
Then, when it arrived: “Don’t know how
I’ll get on with this. I haven’t sung it for
about six months.” But he got through
brilliantly.
Constance Buchan, an Ipswich girl who
won the good opinion of Melba and Fritz
Hart while she was at the Melbourne Con-
servatoriurn, will give Brisbaneites a chance
of hearing her soprano on February 16.
“Bob Ray”: There is a slight error in
“William Devine’s” interesting account of
Jenny Watt Tanner’s career (B. 33/1/T8).
“The Village Priest” was originally produced
by a fine co. headed by Charles Cartwright
and Olgo Nethersole, Olga being the Coun-
tess. Jenny Watt Tanner played the part
of the blind woman. Brough and Bouci-
cault revived the play in ’93, and several
times subsequently. With them Mrs. Brough
was always the Countess. The title rule
has been acted by Cartwright, Titheradn'b
Brough and Flemming, all dead.

Sets her violin a-throbbing,

But, ah! it’s played by her!

THE USES OF ADVERTISEMENT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They saw Eve when she first appeared
Upon the local stage. “In fact,
She is extremely plain,” they sneered,
“And certainly she cannot act.”
Then for a year they read the smart
Advertisements which said her aft
And beauty had no counterpart.
They saw her once again, and had
Their doubts about her looks, but owned
Her acting was not wholly bad.
The third inspection was postponed
For six months. Posters everywhere
Declared Miss Fortesque was fair
And blessed with talents past compare.
Again they see her in a part.
Her talents now they all admit;
Her beauty captures every heart.
And yet Eve has not changed a bit.

To hypnotise the human will
And make it swallow any pill!)

To the prospective buyer
of a motor-car who seeks
to base his judgment of
value, not only on appear-
ance but on something
more, the low relation of
weight to power conveys
a lesson worth heeding.
It means easier control, flexi-
bility, safety, economy
and endurance that can
be relied upon in every
contingency and over a
more than long period of
time and hard usage.
With all its excess power
and light weight the
o o
Series 18 Studebaker
Six retains its distinction
as the leading car for
comfort, convenience and
roominess.

fort and relaxation under
all road conditions.

in equipment the Stude-
baker Series 18 Six
stands pre-eminent as the
car of greatest value in
comparison to all others
offered in this market.
For when you take into
consideration the many
high-grade, necessary
extras with which the
Studebaker Series 18
Six (.and Four) are fitted
as regular equipment —-
and at no advance in
price—you get in these
features alone a very
appreciable increase in
value.

strated to you.

Simple and Effective Methods.
By Olga Amsdkll, Special Correspondent,
London, Eng.
Grey Hair—Home Remedy.
There are plenty of reasons why grey hair
is not desirable, and plenty of reasons why
hair dyes should not be used. But, on the
other hand, there is no reason why you should
have grey hair if you do not want it. To turn
the hair back to a natural color is really a
very simple matter. One has only to get from
the chemist two ounces of concentrate of tam-
malite and mix it with three ounces of bay
rum. Apply to the hair with a small sponge
for a few nights and the greyness will gradu-
ally disappear. This liquid is not sticky or
greasy, and does not injure the hair in any
way. It has been used for generations with
most satisfactory results by those who have
known the formula.
Blackheads Fly Away.
A practically instantaneous remedy for
blackheads, greasy skins and enlarged pores,
recently discovered, is now coming into gen-
eral use in the boudoir. It is very simple,
harmless and pleasant. Drop a stymol tablet
obtained at the chemist’s, in a tumbler full of
hot water. After the effervescence has suit-
sided bathe the face in the liquid, using a
small sponge or soft cloth. In a few minutes
dry the face and the offensive blackheads will
come right off on the towel. Also the large
oily pores immediately close up and efface
themselves naturally. The greasiness dis-
appears and the skin is left smooth, soft and
cool. This simple treatment is then repeated
a few times at intervals of four or five days
to ensure the permanence of the result.
Emergency Complexions.
Even a complexion which is hopelessly .dull
or greasy can be made beautiful in a moment
by a perfectly harmless home recipe. If you
have no cleminite in the house, get about an
ounce from your chemist, and add only
enough water to dissolve it. The process de-
fies detection, and the result is an immediate
appearance of velvety, youthful “bloom”
which every woman desires. The effect will
last all day under the most trying conditions,
indoors or out. and renders powdering quite
unnecessary. This simple substance is also
very good for the skin, and no possible harm
can come from its regular use.
Effectually Killing Superfluous Hair.
Many women know how to remove ugly
growths of superfluous hair temporarily, but
few know how to remove it permanently. For
this purpose pure powdered plieminol may be
used. Get about an ounce from your chemist
and apply a little directly to the objection-
able hair. The purpose of the recommended
treatment is not merely to remove the super-
fluous hair instantly, but also to kill the hair
roots completely in a comparatively short
time.
How Nature Makes New Complexions.
It is well known that the human skin is
constantly undergoing a tearing down and
building up process. With advancing years or
waning vitality this tissue-change lags: the
lifeless, soiled surface skin stays on so long
that its owner gets a “poor complexion.”
Commonsense tells us this dead skin cannot
be enlivened or beautified b.v any cosmetic,
lotion or powder. The natural thing to do is
to actually remove the offensive skin—remove
the bad complexion It has been found that
ordinary mercolized wax completely absorbs
the devitalised skin, in minute particles, so
gently, gradually, as to cause no inconveni-
ence. Mercolized wax, which any chemist can
supply, is put on at night like cold cream,
and washed off in the morning. If you would
have a brilliantly beautiful and youthful com-
plexion, just use this simple treatment.
How to Have Thick and Pretty Hair.
Soaps and artificial shampoos ruin many
beautiful heads of hair. Few people know
that a teaspoonful of good stallax dissolved
in a cup of hot water has a natural affinity
for the hair and makes the most delightful
shampoo imaginable. It leaves the hair bril-
liant, soft and wavy, cleanses the scalp com-
pletely, and greatly stimulates the hnir-
growtli. The only drawback is that stallax
seems rather expensive. It comes to the*
chemist only in sealed quarter-pound pack-
ages, which retail at about four shillings.
However, as this is sufficient for 25 or 30
shampoos, it really works out very cheaply
in the end. [4

What we call courage is
nearly always primarily a
display of unusual nerve,
energy and enterprise. The
man who shows the great-
est courage in an emer-
gency is he who has kept
fit for any emergency.

"THE man who takes half a teaspoonful of Kruschen Salts
* in a tumbler of hot water every day feels fit every
day. His body is cleansed of impurities, his blood courses
freely in his veins; he goes to his work refreshed, alert,
keen and vigorous : he feels ready for action always. He
gets the best out of himself and out of life —and keeps at
arm’s length lassitude, headaches, an inactive liver and con-
stipation—the evils of a sedentary life.
Get the Kruschen habit and keep fit.

THE thing that the people should have
been allowed to realise from the outset
is that WE MAY GET A LICKING. We
still may get a licking. Are you going to
let the Ravisher of Belgium win without
lifting a hand?
For enlistments during 1917 Gippsland
tops the list of Victorian country electorates
with exactly 500 volunteers. The fact has
caused vice-chairman Gillespie, of the Re-
cruiting Committee, to hand an unsolicited
testimonial to McLachlan as the. most enei-
getic Parliamentarian in the business.
’Struth, after all, is more than an exclama-
tion. The other day Private Struth came
back to Grasmere, a Vic. AA estern District
village, after a series of strafing jobs at
Pozieres, Mouquet Farm and Ypres, followed
bv a spell in hospital. Years ago, by the
way, the name used to be St. Ruth; but
time modified it.
“T. 0.1.” : Now being demolished, stone by
stone, a quaint edifice of the old convict
days, near Gosford (N.S.AV.). It is a guaid-
house, erected by F. A. Hely, Superintendent
of Convicts, who died September J, 18ou, and
whose homestead and neglected grave are
close by. The homestead was a large bun-
galow ; from the outside the guard-house
had much the appearance of a church—a
building of two stories in the centre, with a
lean-to on either side. There were two cells
underground, where, ’tis said, were
confined by chain and padlock. Certainl\
there are rings let into the stones in these
cells, which would indicate that prisoners
were supplied with inducements to stay. By
the way, near by are some pear trees which
must be close-on 90 years old.
Of the 180,000 square miles of this con-
tinent where it rains more than 40 inches
per annum, 95,000 square miles are in
Premier Ryan’s garden. There are -00
recorded cases between 1890 and 1916- when
over 10 inches of rain sloshed down on the
official rain-gauge in one day at some point
or another; in fact, there must be .more,
for along the coast nothing below 12 inches
in 24 hours is reckoned worthy of inclusion
among the big falls. And what may happen
over the enormous areas where .the official
gauge doesn’t hang up its hat in the halls
of human habitation no man knows exactly
save the oldest inhabitant, and he is
capable of knowing anything. Croham-
hurst. a green and pleasant spot in the
Blackall Ranges, once registered practically
a yard of rain (2ft. 11.71 in.) in one day
and a night. Port Douglas did itself
proud with 2ft. 7-Ain. and Yarrabah with
2ft. 6-Jin. As for the records between -tt.
and 2sft. of moisture, they are too many
to enumerate. Goondi, which is always
well up in the batting average, recorded
6yd. 2ft. llin. of downfall for the year
1894 —did it without an effort. As for
such items as over 5 yards, places like
Goondi, Innisfail and Harvey’s Creek take
them in their stride, so to speak.
“AA'art” sees an old horror off the
premises : . ■ .
When Governor Macquarie visited Tasmania in
1821 he ordered the removal of the northern estab-
lishment from Georgetown to Launceston, and made
plans for several buildings, including, of course, a
gaol. These were completed in 1824.
The old gaol is now being demolished. Successive
Ministries threatened to do the job, but it was left
to Lee to set the contractors to work. The site is
to be added to the High School grounds. The tread-
mill was done away with as far back as 1854 ; that
part of the premises is used as a stable for the
mounted police.
When Judge Barron Field made his first trip to
Tasmania to hold a court the gaol was so full that
the prisoners had to take turns to lie down. Seventy
prisoners were called up for sentence in one day,
and 18 were sentenced to death. Of late years, how-
ever, only short-sentence men have been kept there,
and it has taken the police all their time to run in
enough casuals to keep the walls decently white-
washed.
The last man to be hanged there was Tony Brax-
ton. He murdered a lady-friend. This was about oo
years ago. My only personal recollection of the
matter is that the murderer had steak-and-kidney
pie for his last breakfast.
The first part the contractors pulled down was the
chapel. It was built with a brick wall about 12ft.
high running down the centre. This .was to prevent
the male and female prisoners from seeing or com-
municating with each other. The privileged parson,
however, could see down both sides.
A good many bushrangers attended the service in
old days —Brown, Hunt, Holland, Brady, Jeffries,
Daulton, Kelly and others of less note. Daulton and
Kelly were hanged here; Brown and Hunt arrived
wounded and died in the gaol. The others were sent
to Hobart to receive the professional attentions of
Dogerty. Brady was undoubtedy the most famous of
all the prisoners. He was the polite ruffian who
would entertain the ladies on the piano while his
followers were robbing the house. On one occasion he
knocked down a member of the gang for attempting
to kiss a servant-girl. All this made him a great
favorite with the ladies, and while he was confined
in the gaol they kept his cell furnished with
flowers, fruit, wine, etc. Once, between jobs, Brady
decided to come up to Launceston and see his old
friend Jeffries, who was in the gaol there. .Jeffries
had been hangman in Edinburgh. Transported to
Tasmania, he escaped and put 13 murders to his
credit. He had been a member of Brady's gang, and
on being captured “peached,” so Brady wanted to
talk to him. Always the gentleman, he wrote to
Colonel Balfor, Commandant at Launceston, to say
that he would be up that night to stick-up the house
of Richard Dry (father of the Tasmanian Speaker)
and also take Jeffries out of gaol and shoot him. The
first part of the programme was carried out; the rest
went wrong. The Government then raised the reward
for the gang to £4OO per head. Soon after Brady
was wounded in the ankle. Batman, later on
founder of Victoria, thought he knew where the
leader was hiding in the Western Tiers, and went out
to look for him. Walking along, he was suddenly con-
fronted by Brady propped up with a wattle-crutch.
Brady covered him and called out to know if he was
a soldier. Batman replied: “I’m no soldier, Brady ;
I’m John Batman. You’d better give yourself up.
There’s no chance.” Brady put down his gun.
“You’re right, Batman,” he said. “And as you’re
a brave man, I give myself up to you and cheat the
soldiers of the reward.” Batman had quite a
triumphal procession into Launceston. AVhile in the
gaol Brady was made, a popular hero; but to his
disgust he was sent to Hobart in company with
Jeffries, hangman and traitor.
Dogerty was easily Van Diemen’s Land’s most
practised hangman. Solomon Blay could never have
reached within hundreds of Dogerty’s total, which
is reckoned to be somewhere about 500. He had
adjusted the noose for as many as nine in one morn-
ing. He took his profession very seriously, and
used to boast that nowhere could you get hanged so
decently as in Hobart. To do him justice, he always
drank himself into a stupor after a job.


STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. Wt
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relievethe pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried by thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn’t got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address

AS GOOD AS A HOLIDAY.
The main object of a holiday is to gain
renewed energy for another year’s work, so
that one may return with sound nerves and
a clear brain, full of vigor and ready for
work again. Unfortunately that object is
not always attained.
It all depends on the state of your blood.
If your blood has become impoverished or
impure the holiday is probably too brief for
you to obtain proper benefit: and very few
people can claim to be free from the dregs
of some ailment which has drained the blood
of its natural strength. That is why they
feel fagged out, brain-weary and incapable
of much exertion.
If you cannot take a holiday—begin now
to build. up your blood with a true tonic, and
so invigorate and refresh your system.
Nothing is more valuable for this purpose
than Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. Over and
over again they .have been proved to be as
good as a holiday to jaded men and women.
Their value to both sexes is made evident by
the fact that these pills make good the waste
caused by illness and the wear and tear of
life.
Any reader of this paper may have a use-
ful booklet on “Building Up the Blood” by
writing to the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co.,

BE PREPARED.
I/ike many
before the
other dangerous maladies diarrhoea often comes on unexpectedly and frequently
patient is aware of it some serious disorder has developed. During the warm
weather attacks of this kind are very frequent and often so swift in their results that life is in danger before the physician
can be summoned.
Those who have the interests of their family at heart keep a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy on
hand for immediate use in cases of this kind. It is without doubt the best medicine prepared for diarrhoea, dysentery and
other disorders of the bowels. If given at the first unusual looseness of the bowels the attack may be avoided but even in
advanced stages it is a quick and most effective remedy.
Never leave home without a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy in your luggage. The excitement
incidental to travelling and change of water and food often bring on diarrhoea, colic and pains in the stomach for which
speedy relief must be obtained and Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy can always be relied upon to do this.
THE thing that the people should have

is that WE MAY GET A LICKING. We

What is Talcum Powder?
TALCUM is an inorganic substance
—neither dampness, heat or perspi-
ration affect it. Rice, starch, and other
vegetable powders are organic— they
are affected by temperature and
moisture—perspiration sours them—
.when sour they become a source of
irritation and a breeding place for
infectious germs.
rrerirrerfs
Borated Talcum Powder
will not sour or ferment; and, medicated in the proper proportion,
covers baby’s skin with a protective coating against
threatening germs. You use Talcum Powder m
such unlimited quantities on the sensitive skin oi
your baby, that the selection of a pure,
safe powder is of great importance.

M.L.A.—Must Live, Anyway.
H. G. Baylis, a draftsman of the N. S.
Wales Lands Office, who lately died sud-
denly at Eastwood, aged 58, was a son of
the one-time P.M. at Wagga who was
wounded in a fight with Morgan, the most
infamous of Australian bushrangers. The
brute was killed at last by a station-hand in
April, 1865.
Among the very few still-living Australian
lawyers admitted in the early ’sixties there
is one, J. E. Bowden, who is not only native-
born himself, but is the son of a Cornstalk.
His grandfather was that Thomas Bowden
who came to Australia in the earliest days
of last century as a school-teacher. The
veteran Six-and-Eightpence of this pioneer
family is now 82.
“Fatherdad”: The wife and I and our
seven children had to go out for half-an-hour
to look at our next home. The wife expected
her friend Maud. So she wrote a note, put
it in an envelope, and harpooned it to the
door with a hatpin. “Go in, Maud dear,” she
told her pal, “the door is not locked. We’ll
be home in less than an hour.” “Look here,”
I protested, “any burglar could read that,
you know.” “Oh, yes,” said the writer
sweetly, “but I've adaressed it to Maud!”
The Victorian Itailway bosses have just
put up a good record in Bed Tape stupidity.
A Melbourne mother, receiving news of the
death in action of her boy, was hurrying to
lur sister’s for comfort, when she heard the
demand, “Show tickets, please!” She then
found she was in a first-class carriage with
a second-class ticket, and, apparently, it did
no good explaining to the checker who dis-
covered the mistake that she wasn’t think-
ing about the sort of carriage she was in.
Then the dunderheaded Department hauled
her to the Footscray Court, and the best offer
its hired Gent, one could make was that
the case would be withdrawn on payment of
7s. Gd. costs. The mother paid the three
halfcrowns and left the court, while the
chairman of the bench made the Depart-
ment’s Gent. One feel miserable. But not
half so miserable as the bowelless clod who
was responsible for the prosecution ought to
be feeling.
“S.S.”: Re the alleged lamentable failure
of a picture management in Melbourne to
secure a live giant over 7ft., I snigger at
the assumption that this implies some, fall-
ing away in the Australian stock. The
giant is a sign of decay just as the dwarf
is Both are the product of degener-
ates. I know an undersized couple, both
afflicted, who have produced six children,
all approaching the gigantic, and all non-
producers in the racial sense. A giant is
the product of disease: certain nerve-centres
have failed to perform their functions; they
have lost control, and a freak is the result.
The defect that produces the giant is only
slightly different from that which produces
the dwarf, and in most cases nature has no
use for either. Giants have been conspicu-
ous failures in this war. An official opinion
from Flanders on some of the prodigies sent
there runs: “Each consumes enough for
four bantams, and is not worth one!” Aus-
tralia wants no giants—not even Billy
Hughes.
“Plumber” : This price-fixing is a fool of
a business unless the price-fixer owns or con-
trols the whole supply. Recently I wanted a
few sheets of plain galvanised iron to re-
bottom some 1000-gallon tanks. I went to
three iron-merchants from whom I buy, but
they said they had none. Getting wise I went
to another—to the iron yard, not the office.
Strolling in I spoke with the foreman about
the weather and the crops and other things,
and we went and liquidated. Finally he
poked me in the ribs. “How - much do you
want?” “Six sheets, 36 x 24.” “Can’t be
did.” “But you’ve got it. You're not keep-
ing it to look at.” “Straight, old man. -We
haven’t got it. We’ve only got 24 x 24.”
“Well, give me nine of them. I’m not
asking the price. Tell the boss I must have
it • I’ve promised to do the man’s tanks and
he’s a good customer.” Then we had “just
one more,” and I whispered (with a wink),
“Tell the boss I want ‘special’-—not the regu-
lation iron.” I got it, and paid cash, without
any invoice. It was, of course, the ordinary,
“fixed” at £56 a ton, but it cost the firm £75
to land here, and I paid a trifle more for my
little lot. Moreover, I could have sold it—
and 10 times as much—five minutes after
at 10 per cent, profit, but it wouldn’t have
paid me. I wanted it.
“A. N. Opheles” buzzes angrily:—
I rise from the stagnant water to jab a prong into
“J. Len” (B. 4/10/’l7) for his effort to contradict
the superior knowledge of “Te Babarantiko” regard-
ing the unhealthy climate of (late) German New
Guinea and New Britain. Malaria is the curse of
this rich and pleasant land, for if it could be eradi-
cated, along with its kindred diseases, filaria, hook
worm, dysentery and beriberi, the New Guineas,
British and Dutch, would be a very pleasant land
indeed. The diseases of civilisation, enteric, typhus,
diphtheria, plague, smallpox, etc., are practically
unknown. Malaria and other preventable tropical
diseases abound; yet with proper medical attention
and the introduction of sanitation and fresh food the
islands would rapidly become a safe place of settle-
ment for the white race. Under present conditions
they are unhealthy, and will remain so until the
various Governments accept the aid of science to
make them otherwise.
In my 20-odd years of tropical experience I have
seen some ghastly effects of disease, bad food and
imperfect hygiene. Take the founding of Finsch
Haven (late German New Guinea): 31 Huns arrived
there to make a settlement; at the end of the first
year only two of them were alive, and they bolted to
another site. Another instance: During the first five
years of the Mambare Goldfield (British New Guinea)
six magistrates died in harness, and the death-rate
of Europeans and their native boys reached 32 per
cent.!
Health in the tropics is a matter of food, housing
and hygiene. Given proper living, the white man
can toil hard in the shade ; but outdoor work under
the blazing sun in an atmosphere with 70 to 80
points of saturation is quite out of the question.
Statistics show that the man who retains good health
is the fellow whose occupation keeps him under cover
from the damaging light rays of the sun; the
missionary, wireless operator, clerk and other easy-
living folk escape most of the serious disease. The
ordinary bloke, the pioneer planter, trader, miner
and the administrative officers of the Governments
all go down to the climate and its diseases.

HA RON ESS CLEO LALIERE
( from, a pltoto.).
Praises
Laxo-Tonic Pills.
Ask a woman what she most desires,
and nine cases out of ten she will
answer “Beauty.” Why she wishes to
be beautiful is in part for the sake of
charming others, hut primarily for
the satisfaction in herself which she
feels would come with the possession
jf beauty. All women can be beauti-
ful if they but give to their own bodies
half the attention they donate to their
clothes. A clean, spotless skin, a
glow of health, clear and sparkling
eyes, are the attributes which will
make any woman beautiful. First, to
become healthy, Laxo-Tonic Pills are
of the greatest and most important
assistance.
Bead the following letter, which was
written to us by the Baroness Lalifire:
There are many times that I
would feel that it was impossible
to continue my work, if it were
not for Laxo-Tonic Pills.
They are a wonderful Tonic and
Blood Purifier. Years ago I had
occasion to use them to remove
some obstinate pimples, which
they did most effectively, and
since then whenever I feel at all
run down, I have always had im-
mediate recourse to Laxo-Tonic
Pills. I consider them a most
wonderful Laxative and Tonic, and
heartily recommend them.
Yours truly,
(Sgd.) CLEO. LALIERE,
38 Alfred Street, North Sydney.

To My Son.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
LITTLE son, when you are grown
Strong enougn to stand alone,
All vour mother’s love and tears
Cannot help you down the years.
All the sin your father knew
ides in wait to trap you, too.
Learn this lesson while you’re young—
Shut your ears and guard your tongue.
I have seen an idle jest
Strike a woman in the breast,
Kill the laughter in her eyes,
Twist the tone of her replies.
Bitter words, recalled too late,
Turn the tide of love to hate.
Guard your lips, my little son,
Lest you weep as I have done.
I have seen a wanton word.
Lightly uttered, lightly heard,
Garbled, twisted out of truth,
Rob a man of all his youth.
Broken faith and blinded eyes
Follow hard on senseless lies.
Son of mine, go shut your ears,
Lest you, too, should know my tears.
When you make a man a friend
Trust him blindly to the end.
Let no word or woman’s whim
Break the faith you have in him.
Sound the depth of feeble sneers—
Guard your lips and shut your ears.
Little son, learn Charity,
Lest you weep.. . .alone. . . .like me.

Deirdre.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
[Connor—his chroniclers spelt his name Conclni-
hor because they had lots of time —was the King of
L ister. Deirdre was the most beautiful woman in the
world, doomed under a curse to bring great sorrow.
She was to have been Connor’s wife, but ran awav
with the young Naisi. The legend has many end-
ings. This is what really happened.]
Act I.
A glen in the Antrim hills. Brown fir-
trees are on the hillside and a bright stream
tumbles down over the mossy stones. Far
up among the trees are the white walls of a
house. It is full summer-time, and the
ground is covered with yellow light on which
the shadows of the branches weave a pattern.
J 1 ar away is a field white with corn, and
beyoiid it a narrow glimpse of blue sea.
C onnor, a tall, bearded man in the prime of
life conies in.
Connor: It is here that they told me at
the house I would find her, but where is
she at all ?
He moves slowly among the tree-stems, and
then puts his hands to his mouth and gives
a hunting call. From the head of the glen
comes a light cry. Deirdre’s white dress
flutters among the rocksj and she comes
bounding down the steep place, her dark hair
floating around her and her white arms out-
spread. She is a slight girl with beautiful
dark eyes and an exquisite flower face, and
the richness of her dress, which is soiled and
torn with brambles, shows her to be a woman
of high rank.
Connor {going towards her): Little play-
mate, it is the whole summer you bring to
me in one sweet look.
Deirdre : Och, Connor, and me not dressed
for company! You big man, walking
always across the world, and me not
knowing when you will come.
She throws herself into liis arms and
laughingly kisses him on the mouth and eyes.
Connor ( holding her away from him and
looking into her face) : Sweetheart, it is
the wonder of all the stars in the night
sky that you have in your face surely.
Deirdre : It is the wonder of a woman’s
love I have in my heart for you, Connor;
and me thinking of you all the hours of
the fine day.
Connor ( sighing ) : Och, well, it is you that
are to make the sorrow of sharp swords;
but I do not care if they were all together
in my own heart when I have your kiss
on my mouth.
Deirdre : Och, Connor, is it always a
curse must come true?
Connor: How would a man know that till
the days have done playing with him?
But maybe a true love in a strong heart
will make a curse a little thing with only
a small blackness in it.
Deirdre : It is not surely for me that have
a man’s love to fear for myself what will
happen; but it is you that are a king and
must be walking among the swords
always.
Connor : Heart, I have a sharp sword
among sharp swords and a king’s word to
speak that is more than the swords.
Deirdre : It is strong you are and very
bold, Connor; but, och, a curse is a thin,
hard thing that might come when a strong
man was sleeping and a bold man too
tired to keep watch.
Connor: Sweetheart, what ails you? Is it
thinking of the curse of sorrow you are,
with the summer-time making laughter in
every tree?
Deirdre ; Och, well, I will forget, for you
are with me.
Connor : Little playmate, we will run up
together to the pool where the brown
trout are lying and talk about the good
days when, the kingdom is made sure, and
you are with me every white hour of the
sweet day.
A horn is heard in the ivoods.
Connor: What horn is that? Who is it
that would be hunting here?
Deirdre : There was a man from the back
hills that saw them in the first of the
morning. There were three tall boys and
four great hounds, and they had a deer
taken in the heather.
Connor : It would, maybe, be Naisi and his
two brothers that are come from Alban.
Och, well, he is a fine boy; and if he has
too much talk he is very young.
A magpie flutters on the ground in front
of them.
Deirdre : Och, Connor, look if there is
another. It is one alone that is no good
at all. There is another surely. One is
for sorrow. Och, surely there is a fellow
to it in the trees.
Connor (gazing among the trees ) : There is
another surely, but I cannot see it for the
sun that is laughing at our foolishness.
He tales her in his arms and hisses her.
The horn is heard again.
Act 11.
The same place later in the day. The horn
has blown three times. Deirdre comes down
the hill from the house. She is in evident
distress. Connor has gone, and the fear of
the curse is on her.
Deirdre : Och, Connor, Connor, what will I
do? Surely it is from me that the sorrow
is to come; and me loving you too much.
Och, my heart, if I could die and go away
and you would forget. But you would not
forget, my soul. Och, it would be sorrow
on sorrow, and you grieving for me
always and forgetting nothing. Is there
no way I could make you forget? Och/.
Connor, I love you too well to be smiling
at you and setting kisses on your mouth
to destroy you.
Naisi comes in. He is very young and boy-
ish, and he is striding up the hill past
Deirdre without seeing her ylien she speaks.
Deirdre: It is a fine evening to you, tall
huntsman.
Naisi (suddenly smitten with her amazing
beauty) : It is a fine—och, what are you
and where did you come from? Are you a
woman at all, or
Deirdre: I am Deirdre.
Naisi : Deirdre! The high gods be kind to
you, princess of the world. I am Naisi,
and my brothers are somewhere in the
woods above.
Deirdre: It is you are the fine man surely
and the great hunter among the trees.
Naisi : It is more than a hunter I am, bright
lady of this glen. I have fought with
swords in a king’s wars, and there is
nothing at all that I ain afraid of.
Deirdre: Och, maybe there is nothing you
are afraid of. (Lamghing.) But maybe
a very bold man would be afraid to put
his two arms about Deirdre that is to
bring the great sorrow and set the love-
kiss on her mouth.
Naisi : It is not courting I am, but hunting
the deer under the high trees and in the
great heather.
Deirdre : Och, you are too young. How
would you be bold enough, and you with
no beard?
Naisi : There is nothing at all in the green
world that can make me afraid.
Deirdre : There is nothing at all surely
except Deirdre, and her with a curse on
her that an old man spoke when he had,
maybe, drunk too much wine.
Naisi : I am not afraid.
Deirdre ( coming very close to him) : Kiss
me, bold man.
Naisi: Well, I will kiss you.
Deirdre: Och, tall man.
She throws her white arms about him.
Naisi kisses her and then staggers drunkenly
ate ay.
Deirdre : Och, tall man, come back to me.
Naisi (turning among the trees) : I will
come back very soon.
He walks on slowly with head bent, turn-
ing twice to look at her. Then he passes out
of sight.
Deirdre : Och, Connor, Connor, man of my
soul. It will be no curse of sorrow for
you, but for me only. Surely you will
think a hard thought of me and forget.
Och, man of my soul, forget!
Naisi comes running back.
Naisi : Deirdre!
Deirdre : It is not far you went nor very
fast.
Naisi : It is for a kiss I came back. I could
not go away.
Deirdre : Och, tall man, you are very bold.
Act 111.
A place in a rath overlooking the sea. It
is a long low room with a table. There are
sounds of storm without, and the room itself
is wrapped in deep gloom. Connor is pacing
to and fro. Fergus comes in.
Fergus : It is true the ivord that was
brought. She is gone to Alban with Naisi
and his two brothers, Ainnle and Ardan,
in a small boat.
Connor: Have you blown the horn to call
the fighting men together? Have you sent
word to Meath and Connaught? It is war
surely. Will a king be robbed in his own
land and him sitting with a clean sword?
Fergus : It is but three there are, and them
young boys. What war would there be to
fight?
Connor: Och, Fergus, it is the soul of me
is broken. What use would a sw r ord be
but to kill me only?
Fergus : It is a poor thing that a king would
break his own heart for a young girl that
is light in the head and foolish.
Connor: Was it a little boat. Fergus?
There is no small boat can go to Alban in
this wind. Look out on the sea. Look out
and tell me is there a boat.
Fergus goes out. Connor walks up and
down thrusting his hands through his lona
hair.
Connor : Och, Deirdre, Deirdre! And me
giving up the soul of me to the taste of
your red lips!
Fergus comes back.
Fergus : They are seen surely. There is a
boat coming in beyond the carrick. It will
be them safe from the sea.
Connor : Blow on the horns, Fergus. Bid a
thousand men with their small bows and
their sharp arrows come now to the shore.
Let every man have his sword ready in
his hand. It is the king’s war.
Fergus (laying a hand on his shoulder) :
Is it for three beardless boys you would
bring an army with calling of horns?
Connor (shaking him off) : Is it my word
that men obey? Blow on thte horns! It
is the kin'g’s war!

THE DAILY NEED FOR ANTISEPTIC ZAM-BUK —THE
EVER-READY, RELIABLE HEALER.
m
CUT HIS HAND
WHILE SAWING.
“While sawing my hus-
band inflicted a nasty
wound in his left hand
with the saw,” says Mrs.
F. Reid, of Fleet Street, Devon-
port, N.Z. “The wound in-
flamed and festered up, and
stubbornly refused to heal,
notwithstanding the various
remedies and treatments we
tried.
INSEPARABLE from the rough, tearing work
of the workshop, railroad, farm or cattle-
station are those every-day cuts and bruises
which may be neglected once too often. Zam-
Buk has brought to the worker new possibilities
in “first aid.’’ Clean the skin round the wound
or cut, and promptly dress the injury with Zam-
Buk. Zam-Buk does more than allay pain and
inflammation; it prevents festering and blood-
poisoning, and heals up your hurt quickly and
perfectly. Zam-Buk is wholesome, and contains
none of the rancid animal fats that make old-
fashioned ointments so risky and useless. When
you cut or scratch yourself the best thing to do
is to apply Zam-Buk, the powerful antiseptic
and healer.
FLYING CHIP CAUSES PAINFUL WOUND.
AS among the tree-fellers and timber-getters, so
in your backyard, chopping wood is not free
from danger. This is illustrated in the case of
Mr. Daniel Connell, of Hollingshead Street, Botany,
Sydney, . who says: “While chopping wood a flying
chip struck me on the leg, causing a nasty wound.
The part became swollen and very inflamed and pain-
ful, and looked so bad that I feared blood-poison
would set in. For seven weeks I was laid up with my
leg, and all the treatments I applied to the wound
were useless. Finally I happened to come across
Zam-Buk, and applied a dressing of this splendid
balm. The first application gave great relief —stopped
the swelling, allayed all the inflammation and eased
the pain. Continuing with the treatment of Zam-Buk,
in a surprisingly short time my leg was completely
healed.”
“At length we happened across Zam-Buk, and were so encouraged with the marvellous benefits
derived from the first applications that we continued to apply this excellent balm. Zam-Buk drew
all the bad matter out oi the sore, allayedall inflammation, finally healing up the place with clean,
healthy skin.”
Every Worker Needs Zam-Buk
Zam-Buk heals
skin injuries, and
ends completely
eczema, ulcers, bad
legs, ringworm,
sore feet, and other
6kin disease. Of

Connor goes out. Fergus looks after him
with a great sorrow in his eyes. Then he
sighs and goes out the other wag. Horns
are heard blowing.
Act IV.
The seashore beyond the carrick. A great
sea is rolling in, and Deirdre stands with
Naisi and his tivo brothers by the boat that
they have just dragged ashore. The wind is
loud and the slanting rain lashes them.
Deirdre : There is a great fear on me.
Connor is near this day ; and us between
his great anger and the green sea.
Naisi : There is no man I fear at all but
the sea only. I will speak the good word
to CoS-or; and if he will not hear me, let
us two fight for you with our swords.
Dierdre : Oeh, why did you come to this
place? It is the sea that is kind and only
on the land that there is sorrow.
She spreads out her hands and runs
towards the loaves. Naisi puts his arm
round her and draws her back.
Naisi : Och, woman, I have a sword; and
the most that the man can do is to kill
me here on the wet shore. Look; they
are coming.
Round the rocky point Connor and Fergus
are seen approaching. Naisi hides Dierdre
behind the boat, and with his two brothers
strides forward to meet the king. Fergus is
seen as if restraining Connor. Bowmen arid
warriors swarm over the rocks.
Naisi ( lifting his voice into a great shout) :
Is it Connor himself, and us blown in by
the great wind on his shore?
Connor: It is Connor himself, and him with
his hand on his sword. But would he
touch with a sword the thief that has a
neck to be hanged on a high tree?
Naisi : It is for Deirdre that is worth the
stroke of a man’s sword when she has
given him the love kiss.
He advances menacingly with his sword
drawn.
Connor : Men of the bows, draw your arrows
to the head. Would a king set dirt upon
his sword blade?
Fergus : Let no man draw his bow. Och,
Connor, surely it is mad you are with the
love of a woman that was light-headed for
a young boy. There is no man in Ire-
land will forget what you are doing this
day. .
Connor : It is the arrows that must speak
a king’s word. Men of the bows, let
them talk in the wind.
There is great confusion among the
crowded bowmen. Some obey Fergus, but
a hundred arrows fly at the king's word.
Deirdre springs up from her place of shelter.
At sight of her Connor utters a loud cry
and runs forwurd. The three brothers fall.
Deirdre, her dark hair streaming in the wind,
meets the shower of small arrows and falls
bleeding into Connor's arms.
Connor : Och, Deirdre, Deirdre!
Deirdre : Man of my soul, it was to lift
the curse of the sorrow. ( Panting for
breath.) And I have sent a young man
with no fault to his death.
Connor: Och, my woman, it is mad I am
with the thing that is done.

How it Happened.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE had to find Black Beauty and her
calf....and there were three of us
to do it. That’s how the trouble
started.
The day was hot: which accounted for our
taking the track by the river, though, inci-
dentally, there were two good blood-sucker
logs and a new snake-hole along .that way.
But any design on or thought of the possi-
bilities of the big log-pile on the headland
never entered our minds; to that extent we
were innocent.
Of course, if you put us to the question,
we never really knew of a blood-sucker
sucking one’s blood. But then we never
really knew that one had never done it —
or mightn’t do it some time. There were
lots of things one couldn’t be sure of. They
used to say that Topsy was a quiet cow, the
quietest in the yard, and we believed it till
one day Frank and Jack Hunniford tried to
ride her at once while I drove her by the
tail, and she kicked me over and tossed them
both after she had bucked them off. So as
we couldn’t be sure about the blood-suckers,
and as we had heard no good of them, we
just went on calling them blood-suckers
because it sounded a good sort of name.
Several heroic attempts on the part of
one or other of us to pump enthusiasm into
the quest for Black Beauty did bring spas-
modic responses; but the lady was no ordi-
nary cow when it came to planting her
young calf. Anyway, we were sick of cows.
The trouble began with Lena. It always
did. But that comes later.
The first blood-sucker . log was a disap-
pointment. Mrs. Blood-sucker was not at
home to callers, and Mr. Blood-sucker was
evidently in poor spirits, for after flicking
his blue tongue at us in a half-hearted man-
ner once or twice he ran up the hole in the
log, and our fiercest taunts and insults,
that no self-respecting lizard could ignore,
brought no reappearance of the recreant.
With a final rasp of our sticks along his
wooden roof and the frank expression of
our opinion that they were cocktails, we
were going on peaceably; but Lena took
exception in her usual way to my manner
of speech towards lizards in general.
Reminding her that she was afraid of
them wasn’t mending matters ; but the snake-
hole took our attention just then. Mr. Snake
was sumiing himself outside liis new resi-
dence. He didn’t hoist any flags of defiance
and he wasn’t worth much as far as size
went; but snakes were snakes, and we
killed him on principle and went on, argu-
ing as we went over the possibility that
Beauty and her calf might have been over-
looked in a shady gully-bed some way back.
Opinions were still vexed when the second
blood-sucker log hove in sight. That couldn’t
be resisted. Frank and I promptly chal-
lenged the keepers of the castle in the recog-
nised fashion, and our challenge was as
promptly accepted.
Out came the fierce little black creatures,
bristling and darting their blue tongues with
as much assurance as if they were flaming
swords that could annihilate us. Excite-
ment, for two of us, at any rate, ran high.
Lena stood at a respectful distance
haranguing me on the old question of pro-
priety, and telling me that it wasn’t ladylike
to tease lizards, and she would tell mother.
That was too much ; “ladylike” was forever
in my ears in those days, when, if they had
only known it, my dreams ran to bushrang-
ing and such like, and mere recreations such
as lizard-teasing were only the result of the
sternest self-denial.
We chased her back to the bend with the
threat of a green frog down her back. We
were rid of her, and had almost decided to
look hard for Black Beauty, when alas! we
saw the logs. Why hadn’t we seen them
before? Or, rather, why hadn’t we seen the
possibilities of them?
There they lay, a little mountain of logs
on a high headland. Beneath, the river ran
lazy and deep, with scarce a curl to mark
the menace of the undertow. We looked
at one another, we looked at the logs and
the river. “Just the top one,” we said, and
meant it, I think, when we said it.
The weather-worn handspikes lay where
the men had thrown them. We seized them,
and, heavy as they were, we clambered up
the pile and fixed them in place for a good
purchase. Then the tussle began between
our determination and the weight of that
top log. We panted and Strained; at first
vainly, then hopefully, then triumphantly.
The great log heaved and paused while we
held our breath ; then with a grinding rush
it raced down the heap, struck the ground
with a hollow bump and went leaping down
the cliff. We watched it, fascinated.
Spl—a—sh ! and it swirled around head-
on to the current and shot downstream with
only its back showing, like a fat sea-serpent.
Ic was great —greater and more desirable
than anything in the whole world of tame
happenings! The quest for Black Beauty
and her calf was far off and long ago. Noth-
ing mattered only this stolen hour, this riot
of whirling logs and foaming water. For
us was neither heat nor weariness nor any
withdrawing—nothing but the roll and
bump, the grind and the long leap as we
sent monster after monster, like Leviathan
back to his Deep.
But the hour passed. We stood on the
headland very silent. Round our feet a few
beetles and things scuttled for cover from
where the last log had lain. The angry river
was creamed with foam-clots still, and past
the bend there came to us the faint palonka
palonk where some log jostled its fellows in
the stream.
It was far too late to find Black Beauty
now. It would be pitch dark before we
could make home. And then
Doggedly we faced about; some things
have to be done somehow. The scrub was
full of black shadows now, black, sneaking
things that crawled —or was it our guilty
consciences? A spotted native cat swore
openly at us as he sprang across our track
and vanished in his log. “Kagga gooka,” he
said in good native cat, which having no
equivalent in polite English I can only tact-
fully interpret as' “Gerout —who cares for
you f” But we went on sadly. We had done
with native cats.
We passed the blood-sucker’s log with
scarcely a glance. What did lizards matter,
after all? The little dead snake hung limply
on the stump where we had hung him ; but
somehow we felt no pride of victory. Per-
haps even he had the best of things when
all was said and done, for he was dead and
we were alive. And Black Beauty wasn’t
found. And.... round the furthest bend,
where the logs were driving seaward, was
the new pumping-plant that was to supply
the township with water!

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE days and nights are fled, my dear.
The noons all droop into the mid-
night’s heart;
A pallid dawn comes whispering near —
Whispering that these, who lately loved,
now part.
Let us have done, my heart, have done!
In lavender and tears we’ll hide all this.
Our Paradise is lost and gone—
Lost even as this last, long, lonely kiss.
Time was I watched your face in fear,
And long and ardently; and well I know
The hair curls featly by your ear,
And how your fingertips are white as
snow.
Your eyes of moon-frail light are made;
All this I know, and well. The lattice, too,
Your fingers made for eyes that prayed
And called your angels down your dawn
for you.
Let be, belov&d, oh, let be!
The radiant nothings that were ours are
dead ;
Your eventides and noons for me
Shine nevermore. For now the sun dips
red;
And now the night falls, drear and old.
Listen! The far call cries adown the
sky
How cold these shadows grow—how cold!
Good-night, my heart! O Heart o’ me,
good-bye!

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

SOMETHING
If Engineers and Steam-plant Owners would only
realise the importance of EFFICIENTLY insulating
tlieir Boilers, Steam Pipes, etc., .more attention might
he paid to this particular matter. Great economies
can be effected in this direction, in some cases the coal
consumption being reduced as much as 50%. But the
insulating material must he of the very best.
Carbonate of Magnesia is to-day recognised as the best
non-conductor of heat. Newall s Coverings are com-
posed of 85% of this material, and 1570 Asbestos—the
Asbestos being used for binding purposes only—and in
addition possess innumerable advantages over all other
forms of lagging. Newall’s Coverings are used, practi-
cally exclusively, by the British Admiralty, N'.S.W.
and Victorian Governments, and have been used
throughout the Ultimo. White Bay, Melbourne, Perth
and Canberra Power Stations.

F. D. McMASTER, Esq., Dalkeith, Cassilis, writes, under date 34th January:
“I have pleasure in stating that I have given both of the 3 Stand Portable
Crutching Plants I purchased from you, an exhaustive trial, and with the
utmost satisfaction. They are handy to move about, economical to run, and
the Fairbanks Morse Engine is simplicity itself. Crutching at the different
sheep-yards is, in my opinion, a far better method than doing the work at
the woolshed, as- the saving for the lambing ewes in driving alone is very
considerable.”
