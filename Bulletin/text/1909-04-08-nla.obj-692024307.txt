Second Bests.
SOME novelists are born successful,
like Marie Corelli• some achieve
success af te r a long attack on the pub-
lic, like Meredith; some have success thrust
upon them, like Du Maurier. There are
others who strike it at the first go, but
never again ; they put all their stock in
the window and go bankrupt when the
call comes for a second display. Others,
again, begin well, then miss two or three
times, and hit it once more in another
way. And others never succeed or
utterly fail, but flow on with the un-
varying tedium of a drain—(metaphors
had to be judiciously mixed): The
careers of all of them can be represented
by wavy lines like isobars, or those on a
stock exchange chart. Just now, while
H. G. Wells touches his highest point,
we are in troughs of the waves which
represent W. J. Locke, J. C. Snaith, Miss
Winifred James, and some others. Their
next books may send them to the crest
of a wave as high as that which rose over
Messina ; but it is inevitable that their
present performances, however good in
themselves, should be compared with
their past.
Upton
Sinclair.
Not many writers could hope to repeat
a success like that of The Jungle. Millions
used canned meat; but the
matter of its preparation had
never worried them, and The
Jungle came as sickening shock. The
subject had never been dealt with in
fiction before; the characters were fresh
and sufficiently life-like, and Upton Sin-
clair did not spare the lurid details.
The Money Changers, in which he tries
to do the same thing with Wall-street
that he did with Armour’s pork-packing
industry, follows a large number of
exposures, in fiction and otherwise,
of the hanky-panky methods of the
American money market, so that it has
not the charm of novelty. If this indict-
ment and other similar ones are a true
bill, Hew York and Chicago must be
something like the Cities of the Plain—it
would be precious hard to find five honest
men in them ; amongst the well-to-do,
impossible. The Money Changers, as a
novel, is burdened with its purpose, and
the characterisation is slight. It is fairly
well written, however, and worth reading.
The book, which is dedicated to Jack
London, comes to us from George Robert-
son and Co.
Winifred
dames.
Miss Winifred James, the Victorian girl
who struck oil with her first book, Bachelor
Betty, has not repeated that success in
Patricia Baring (Constable). For
three parts of the way it reads like
a story for girls, with a sprinkling
of hymns and occasional sparkles which
recall Betty. The “ little girl ” part is
not very good; she thinks and talks
then in much the same way as she
does when nineteen. Patricia is by no
means a Sunday-school miss, but is very
independent, frank and impetuous : a little
pagan brought up in a Methodist house-
hold. One of the good and proper
people presents her with Mrs. Brown-
ing’s Poems and Sesame and Lilies. In her
diary she confesses : “I have tried to read
them, but somehow I can’t get on. I don’t
think I care for poetry, and with the other I
feel as if it is a lesson how to be good by
someone who doesn’t know how to be bad,
and that kind of person isn’t much help to
me.”
The grown-up Patricia is beautiful, and
has a number of lovers. In a perfectly irra-
tional, but no doubt perfectly feminine way,
she selects the least likely man of the lot—a
churlish fellow, who adopts a cynical atti-
tude, and does not court her. She throws
herself into his arms, and the night before
he leaves for India she makes the complete
surrender. He is to return within a year
and marry her ; but after two years’ sus-
pense he writes that the affair is off—he has
met someone else. And somehow one can-
not feel very sorry for Patricia.
_J. C. Snaith’s Araminta (per Roy croft
Library) is the niece of Caroline, Countess
of Crewkerne, a fiery, eagle-beaked, old
Snaith. wor Wling, rich and childless;
who, on her 73rd. birthday,
decides to make an experiment. Her
sister, who had so far forgotten her-
self and her family as to marry
a penniless parson, and had been
thereupon cast into the outer darkness,
departed this life in Slocum Magna,
leaving the still poor parson a large
family of girls. The Countess writes to
him to despatch the best of the bunch to
London. The reason for the apparent
softening of the geological formation
which served as Crewkerne’s heart is that
her hired companion was getting tire-
some and her dog, Ponto, was getting fat.
The experiment proves more successful
than she had anticipated. When the
consignment arrives, it turns opt to be
six feet high, and clad in a faded
print dress, darned cotton gloves, cob-
bled boots, and a hat which might
have been used to carry vegetables.
She bdtrays an inordinate appetite
for bread and jam, and whenever
asked her name, she.replies in a ludicrous
drawl that even Ponto smiled at: “My
name is Araminta, but they call me
Goose because I am rather a Sil-lay.”
While she is sitting on the sofa thinking,
with moist eyes and finger in mouth, of
her home in Slocum Magna, where the
bread and jam, at any rate, were more
substantial, the Earl of Cheriton calls.
Cheriton, bewigged, corseted, dyed, and
65, has an artistic eye, and discovers
that Araminta on the sofa is a reincar-
nation of Gainsborough’s “Araminta,
Duchess of Dorset,” which adorns the
Countess’s walls; he recognises, in spite
of the grotesque attire, a veritable Juno
with pink and white complexion and
flamboyant hair, and at once undertakes
to stage-manage her conquest of London.
\S>
Then a used-up member of the peer-
age called Gobo, because he gobbles
like a turkey, comes on the scene and
evinces a desire to make Araminta another
Duchess of Dewlap. There is a young
artist named Lascelles, a protege of
Cheriton’s, wdio paints the Goose’s por-
trait and falls in love with her.
Araminta is a bit of dough, but just
human enough to love Lascelles, who is
young and wholesome, and whom she
knew in childhood. However, the old
virago bulldozes her into accepting Cheri-
ton. Everything is arranged ; but almost
at the last moment he hands her over to
Lascelles and pays him ,£lO,OOO for his
portrait of Araminta. Cheriton fades
away up stage, and all the other characters
are brought on in a hurry and happily
despatched. (It may be noted in passing
that Carbine is now the synonym for
speed in an English novel. The ancient
Eclipse, which held the field for a long
time, has apparently been buried.)
The style is every bit as bright and
incisive as in Snaith’s previous novels,
but Araminta is a creation which began
well and then got out of hand, like the statue
in The Wrong Box. She may have the
blue blood of Gainsborough’s Duchess in
her veins, but she is no true descendant
of Broke of Covenden. In fact, she looks
suspiciously like a hasty invention to
keep Mr. Snaith’s pot a-boiling.
A Solo by Santley
Reminiscences of My Life, by Sir
Charles Santley (Pitman and Sons,
Ltd.), is the second lot published
by the well-known baritone. The
present volume has a special interest
for Australians, as it contains an account
of his tour in this country in 1889-90.
He has, however, hardly anything to say
about Australia. Some of his experiences
were not pleasant, and perhaps they
discolored his views of the place—
or perhaps he didn’t think much
of it, and therefore preserved a gene-
rous silence. Many pages are taken
up with keen recollections of the unfor-
tunate business arrangements he made
here, the rats, cockroaches and mos-
quitoes which troubled him, and the
wretched cooking he had to endure. But
he found staunch friends and pleasant
acquaintances in each of the cities he
visited, and records the fact that “ the
friends I made in Australia whom I
can never forget were, with few excep-
tions, Australians born and bred; the
acquaintances I made whom I strive to
forget were, without exception, importa-
tions from the mother country.” The
memories which seem to stand out most
vividly in his long care#r are associated
with feeds. He is no epicure, but he
demands good cooking. Many places
are for ever damned because of the atro-
cious grub he got there. On the voyage
to Australia he complained that there
was too much food put on the table, but
he could not get any of the simple dishes
which would have rejoiced his heart—
boiled leg of mutton and boiled corn
beef—though the second-class passengers
got them. He remembers that, in 1859,
he dined at four, and, after a heavy
opera and fast of about eight hours, he
frequently ate for supper a sheep’s heart
roast with sage and onions, accompanied
by an abundant salad, and went to sleep
in a jiffey. “ I do not sleep long, but
broad, while I am at it, and beyond
dreaming I am chased by a bull or other
pet animal I get through my nights most
satisfactorily.” Details are given of vari-
ous dinners' of which tender memories
remain. One, on a Cunard liner in 1871 :
“ I retain in my mind’s eye even now, a
splendid roast shoulder of mutton, a pic-
ture to behold and as tender as the
most delicate lamb to masticate, and of
a flavor to satisfy the most exigeant
epicure (I regret I did not—perhaps I
could not—take another slice) ; with it
we had a peas pudding— c a globe of
beauty and a joy to memory dear.’ ”
Of course there is a good deal about
music and musicians. Sims Reeves and
his devoted wife he mentions often, and
he warmjy defends Reeves against the
uncharitable charges of intemperance
made/against him because he often failed
to keep appointments. Singers and
actors are reputed to be more than
usually vain and jealous ; certainly they
are often nervous and irritable, but
they are a warm-hearted and generous
fraternity—as several stories in this book
show.
Santley, as might be expected, looks
back regretfully to old times and old
fashions in music and in life. Wagner
he does not think much of—did he not
subordinate the singers to the orchestra 1
Motor-cars, mechanical devices, the noise
and hurry of these latter days he abhors.
Rather would he have a solid convenient
carriage or a good sailing ship for travel-
ling. “I like ballads, for instance, The
Erl King, which I always consider the
model ballad ’’—but he does not like the
maudlin sentimentality of the modern
things^—“the namby-pamby words of
‘ Come into the Garden, Maud,’ the vul-
gar commonplace of ‘ When Other
Lips,’ ” ; though “an artiste like Reeves
could invest such wt>rds with a charm
which, in themselves, they did not pos-
sess.”
At a dinner he met Rossetti, who did
not impress him favorably, “ neither sub-
sequently did his works, poetical or pic-
torial. ... I cannot imagine who it was
dubbed him poet.” The Reminiscences
are not very lively, but they are honest;
and those who knew or heard the singer
may find it worth while to listen to his
free and discursive comments on men and
things.

Banjo Paterson’s novel, The Outback
Marriage, is now obtainable in the Common-

vt/
Pinero’s new play, The Thunderbolt, what-
ever may be its acting qualities, will be
found eminently readable. There is no
problem ; it is merely a dramatic episode in
the history of a provincial family, a comedy
in which the gods make merry with some
commonplace mortals by holding before them
the prospect of sharing the estate of a
deceased brother, who is supposed to have
died intestate, and then hurling the thunder-
bolt in the shape of a confession by one of
them that there was a will. The 'economy of
means in the drama deserves study by aspir-
ing Australian playwrights. It is like a Phil
May drawing : every line tells in fixing the
character or helping forward the plot, and
there is not a line too many.
Tabloids
W. H. Hudson, a competent authority
and clear writer, provides a summary of
Herbert Spencer’s philosophy, with a note
on the philosopher’s life and character, in
Constable’s “Philosophies, Ancient -and
Modern.” In eighty odd pages the reader
who wants to know what Spencer was up to
will get, for Is. net, the concentrated essence
of the numerous heavy volumes containing
the Synthetic Philosophy, and he ought to
be grateful.
Harper’s are publishing a “Library of
Living Thought," which is advertised as
containing a large amount of literary nour-
ishment in small space —but this time it
costs you 2s. 6 d. net per tabloid. The first
is by Swinburne on Three Plays of Shake-
speare. The essays are reprinted from
Harper's Magazine (1902-3), where they
were graced by Abbey's illustrations. The
greatest living poet on the greatest of
all poets cannot fail to be interesting
whether you agree with him or not.
Though sometimes extravagantly stated,
the tenor of his judgments can be safely
accepted ; and he presents Othello in a new
light, by a fine comparison with Cinthio’s
story upon which the tragedy was based.
Once or twice the Swinburne of Essays and
Studies bursts out, as in the note on King
Lear, where we are told :
‘‘That Shakespeare’s judgment was as
great and almost as wonderful as his genius
has been a commonplace of criticism ever
since the days of Coleridge ; questionable
only by such dirty and dwarfish creatures of
simian intellect and facetious idiocy as mis-
take it for a sign of wit instead of dullness,
and of distinction instead of degradation, to
denyvthe sun in heaven, and affirm the fra-
grance of a sewer.”
Can anyone produce the dirty Simian
“ who deniges of it ” ?
W
Some people seem to be concerned as to
what would be the best book to have with
them in the event of their being wrecked on
a desert island, apd, in a London paper, the
Bible, Shakespeare, Gibbon, Boswell, a dic-
tionary, etc., have been suggested by the
army of unpaid space-fillers. Any of the
regulation “hundred best books” might be
useful food for meditation while you starved
to death ; but an unassuming and practical
friend would be The Frontiersman’s Pocket-
Book, edited by Roger Pocock (John
Murray), which gives valuable informa-
tion on foraging for tucker and cook-
ing it, pathfinding, building canoes
and rafts, signalling, and simple medi-
cal treatment. Armed with a book like
this Robinson Crusoe would have had a
vastly better time on his island and could
have got away much earlier—barring acci-
dents. The advice is brief and to the point,
as this : “ Over-riding. If a tenderfoot
allows his horse no chanee to stale, apply a
sudden shock of cold water over loins, also
over tenderfoot. ” Though primarily intended
for the scout and frontiersman, it will be
found a useful companion for a soldier in
any branch of the service, and even the ex-
perienced bushman might get good hints
from it on horses, hunting, camping, im-
provising appliances for emergencies, etc.
Various well-known soldiers, authors and
travellers contribute to this well-compiled
manual, and amongst them is Evelyn Efrench,
formerly horsebreaker, stockman and station
manager in N.S.W., and author of a little
volume of promising verse.
THE FORELOPER.
The gull shall whistle in his wake, the blind wave
break in fire,
He shall fulfil God’s utmost will, unknowing His
desire;
And he shall see old planets pass and alien stars
arise,
And give the gale his reckless sail in shadow of
new skies.
Strong lust of gear shall drive him out and hunger
arm his hand
To wring his food from a desert nude, his foothold
from the sand.
His neighbors’ smoke shall vex his eyes, their
voices break his rest,
He shall go forth till South is North, sullen and
dispossessed ;
And he shall desire loneliness, and his desire shall
bring
Hard on his heels a thousand wheels, a people,
and a king ;
And he shall come back in his own track, and by
his scarce cool camp—
There he shall meet the roaring street, the derrick
and the stamp ;
For he must blaze a nation’s ways with hatchet
and with brand,
Till on his last won wilderness an empire’s bul-
warks stand.
Rudyard Kipling.
(An early poem, recently dug up and reprinted
in the American "‘Bookman.”)

DEBILITATION,
NERVOUSNESS.
HOW HEALTH WAS RESTORED.
“ When I first made the acquaintance of
Clements Tonic, some twelve years since, I was
living in Croydon,” said Mrs. Edith Browne, of 63
Mount 'Vernon Street, Forest Lodge, “and my
memory is so clear concerning the details of my
illness that it seems only yesterday that .1 threw
all my infirmities away.”
“ If you don’t mind, I’d like you to give me an
outline pf your sufferings,” remarked the writer.
“ How long were you ailing?”
“ Quite eighteen months, and during that time
I was treated by several doctors, besides being an
indoor patient of a hospital for six weeks, from
which institution I returned home as bad as ever,
and it really seemed to me that I was never going
to get well again. For a mother with a young
family to be in such a plight as I was in is enough
to break one’s heart to contemplate, and my prin-
cipal reason for giving my experiences for public
circulation is that I hope to assist other women in
throwing off their ailments, as I did. My nerves
were in a shockingly bad state—fairly jangling
together.”
“Did the doctors say what was wrong with
you, Mrs. Browne?”
“ They said I was dyspeptic, and greatly debili-
tated, and well I know it. I might say I was
so fearsome that even my own shadow frightened
me. Oh ! it was a wretched condition to be in,
with nothing but worry and trouble, and suffering
for my daily companions. But I believe nervous-
ness to have been the most awful bane of my life.
You’ve no idea how I was. The imaginations
that filled my brain were simply hideous. They
actually made me shudder. If I slept at all, whicl)
was very seldom, I would wake up from dreams
that were ugly .in the extreme—always fraught
with circumstances and happenings of a dreadful
nature, and I’d find myself shaking from head to
foot. I’d be afraid of falling asleep again, because
those dreams were too terrible to bear repetition.
During both day and night I always had an idea
that somebody was standing at the baek of me,
with some evil object, of course ; and to tell you
the truth, my life was unbearable. For six
months I could take only the lightest of food, and
very little of that, so you may conjecture that I
diminished in weight a good deal.”
“Do you require to exercise discretion over
your food now ?”
“No, indeed.; not since Clements Tonic cured
me years ago, have I had to bother, about what I
ate, or what I left alone, for it made my digestion
so sound that it doesn’t matter what I take, as I
can digest all foods readily, and that means every-
thing to a person’s health. If you can eat well, and
digest your food, there is nothing wrong. That is
my experience, at any rate, and so long as I can
do that I shall continue to be the healthy and
contented woman that Clements Tonic has made
me. Up to the time of starting with that remedy,
I suffered from sharp pains, which ran from mv
chest right through to my back. I was never
without them ; also headaches and giddiness, and
I don’t suppose a woman ever lived who was more
fretful than I used to be. Often, without any
cause, I would go and shut myself in my room, and
cry for hours. And I was given to fainting bouts
as well. All of a sudden a quivering sensation
would pass through me, and off I’d go. Oh [often
I wished myself dead, and away from my afflic-
tions ; but now, thank God, I want to live as long
ss I can, to enjoy the many charms, in this world
that are visible only to those in good health. My
gratitude to Clements Tonic for raising me up
when nothing else could, will last as long as there
is breath in my body, and so till then shall I
always advise other sufferers to use the same
remedy, for I am firmly convinced there is no-
thing to approach Clements Tonic for curing the
ills I have mentioned. To me it was perfection.
It drove away those headaches, it completely
abolished the pains from the various parts of my
body, the fits of giddiness and faintness have died
years ago, my nights became restful, and—yes,
happiest achievement of , all, my nervousness was
entirely banished. So publish these facts in any
way you prefer.”

“ What excuse can I make ?”

When that old salt, Le Testu,
Came through uncharted seas
And saw dim capes and highlands
Beyond the southern islands
In unexplored degrees;
Where Dampier and De Quiros
And Tasman led their bands,
With questers of Van Diemen,
They found, the roving seamen,
New capes of nameless lands.
They drew their keels, the sea-dogs,
By scarps of empty bays ;
By bights that dreamed and slumbered ;
By shores of ships uncumbered,
And barren waterways.
Like strange sea-hawks they hovered ;
With prows that spurned the foam—
With all the sails they carried—
They halted not, nor tarried,
But turned their heads for home !
They drew, across strange waters,
Strange men with motley crews
The wights of Spain and Flanders,
The dauntless Netherlanders,
The luckless La Perouse.
The old flag of his fathers,
That bears the ancient bars,
He planted, strong and surely,
That it should root securely
And blossom into stars !
And while the world was watching
Half-conscious of its loss,
With lust of conquest regal
Swooped down the old sea-eagle,
And seized the Southern Cross.

THE BORROWING POLICY.
HUNGRY MAORILAND CHILD ( A.D . 1960): “Mother, can’t we have some more butter?”
HARASSED MOTHER: “No, my child, we haven’t finished paying our share of the cost of the battleships which our patriotic Premier.
Mr. Ward, presented to Britain 51 years ago, and we have to be very careful.”


THAT DREADNOUGHT—AND ASQUITH’S
PROBABLE RAGE AT HEARING OF
THE SAME.
The Joseph Ward Government of Maoriland,
the one which leaped wildly in the air the other
day, and tendered a Dreadnought—or “two if
necessary ” —to Britain, must surely by this time
begin to suspect that something is wrong. The
trouble hasn’t arisen in Maoriland, though that is
where it might naturally be looked for, seeing
that Ward’s offer, being made without the
authority of Parliament, was wholly unconstitu-
tional. The trouble is at the other end. True, many
British papers and many unattached politicians
applauded the proposal to the skies; they could
hardly do otherwise, for imperial “ loyalty ” is a
thing that must be encouraged even if it mani-
fests itself in awkward ways. And the British
Government also applauded in a non-committal
way, but there appears, all the same, to be good
reason to believe that Asquith and his col-
leagues cursed inwardly at Maoriland’s ex-
citement, and that the prospect of getting
a Dreadnought from Australia is making
them curse even worse. At all events, the
acceptance of the Maoriland “gift” was a very
cautious affair. The Dominion wasn’t told in
cordial language to go right ahead with its Dread-
nought; it was warmly thanked, and the offer
was accepted in a postponed sort of way, and
Maoriland was told something to the effect that,
when the proper time came for it to rush at the job,
it would be duly advised. If the proper time never
comes, Maoriland will probably not be advised at
all. The reply made the Paul Mall Gazette so
angry that it accused Asquith of “ mocking and
evading ” the Dominion’s purpose, and it is pos-
sible that newspaper and other remonstrances may
yet drive the British Government into assuming a
wild enthusiasm which it doesn’t feel. Yet when
the matter is considered from Premier Asquith’s
probable and natural point of view', it must be ad-
mitted that the British Ministry has every reason
for being angry. Let the situation be considered
in detail, and see how it pans out.
* * * ■*
Australia (which for this purpose includes
Maoriland) has received many broad hints from
Britain that, in view of the stupendous sea-
armaments of Germany (not that Germany is
specially mentioned), the Cold Country dare
not divide its battle fleet by sending any
serviceable ships to the aid of remote de-
pendencies —and Australasia is a very remote
dependency indeed. To despatch a squadron
of up-to-date ships on a voyage from which it
could not return for some months would mean
that the rest of the fleet might be crushed in its
absence. Then it wouldn’t be worth while for
the detached squadron to go back ; if the rest of
the fleet had been overpowered and crippled it
could only go back to be wiped out in detail also.
Under such conditions the British isles, left help-
less by reason of their almost complete depend-
ence on foreign food supplies, and with no chance
to do any land-fighting, might have to make peace
on condition that they paid a huge indemnity,
surrendered Australia and Maoriland, and agreed
to such a limitation of their sea armaments that
they would cease to be a great European Power.
When a usually sober British Ministry tells a
usually sober House of Commons that Germany
has provided some £200,000,000 for naval construc-
tion ; that its present naval programme includes
the construction of 33 first-class battleships—
which practically means an attempt to make
Germany instead of Britain the Power which is
the equal on the sea of any other two Powers;
and that the British fleet must be practically

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tub Bulletin would oblige the paver
(and, to an extent, themselves) by taking some care as to
methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, advertise-
ments, etc.) should in no case be addressed to the Editor,
but to the Manager. To send them to the Editor is to
invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters to
anyone by name. “ The Editor, Bulletin,” is the proper
superscription for “ copy.” Delay, and even loss, is
sometimes caused by addressing to persons instead of
officials. The person may not be there; the official
always is.

THURSDAY, APRIL 8, 1909.
THE SLUMP OF THE CANBERRA
CAPITAL.
As time goes on the stock of the doleful Yass-
Canberra Federal capital site gets low. Yassberra
began its career under the serious disadvantage
that it was all a delusion. Hardly anybody really
wanted it save, perhaps, J. C. Watson (the reason
for his sudden and incurable frenzy for the place
has never been adequately explained), a few
deluded Sydney traders, the Sydney daily papers,
and State Premier Oarruthers who stole the
wire netting, and who evidently only wanted to
show his great, awful, tremendous importance
by shifting the capital around single-handed.
The attitude of the Sydney daily papers is
understandable. A city on or about the 100-
miles line from Sydney would be so situated that
the Sydney papers would get there long before the
Melbourne ones, and if Melbourne made some
special effort to get its papers there early, Sydney,
having control of all the railways leading to
the capital, could easily fix things so that
Melbourne’s papers would get there darned
late. As for the Brisbane and Adelaide
papers they would have' no show at all.
Then, again, the Yassberra capital was to be
so near to Sydney that the Sydney papers
could compete vigorously against any attempt to
establish a big local daily. Therefore there was
every reason to hope that, with a Federal city down
by Lake George, the Sydney papers would get the
advertising business and the circulation, and
also be able to shout the Freetrade and Anti-Sosh
superstition in the ear of the Federal politician at
breakfast time, long before any journalistic com-
petitor got on the scene. With these interests
at stake, any person could offer a suggestion as to
the reason why the Sydney dailies hollered so
strenuously for this particular site. As for the
trading community of Sydney, it was maddened
by the assurances of the daily papers that
its commercial interests would be scattered
to the four winds unless the capital
was placed as close as possible to its
own offices and warehouses. The assurance
was a curious evidence of the low estimate which
the dailies put on the intelligence of their readers,
for the creation of a rival city and a rival port
almost on Sydney’s doorstep seems a very unpro-
raising short cut to wealth, but the traders and
importers of the N.S.W. capital are so accustomed
to take their opinions from the morning papers
that for a time they accepted the assurance, and
fell in. The people were informed by the Sydney
morning papers that they were howling for a
Federal capital at Yassberra, and, though nobody
was howling, almost everybody was persuaded by
the Sydney morning papers that the rest of the
community was. There was so little real excite-
ment over the matter that it was impossible to
scrape up even one public meeting on the ques-
tion, but the impression remained that somebody
was crying out somewhere for a Yassberra capital
because the Sydney morning papers Sciid so. And
a whole horde of politicians got the idea that the
only way to secure their re-election was to give
way to the imaginary popular clamor —invented
by the Sydney daily papers—for Yassberra, and
they voted accordingly. Yet with all the bogus
clamor it is hard to find evidence that anybody
ever clamored at all save the Sydney daily papers
(which might have a fairly reasonable motive) and
J. 0. Watson (whose motive will perhaps be
revealed on Judgment Day), and J. H. Car-
RUTHERS, whose motive seems plain enough.
* * * *
The Fisher Government hastened to go with
the imaginary tide, and set to work to peg out a
Federal territory in the Yassberra district.
Minister Hugh Mahon established a luxurious
camp there, and invited the members of the Aus-
tralian Parliament to come and drink in the
beauties of the scene, but few of them felt that
they could stand the shock, and the camp re-
mained nearly empty. An area of 1000 square
miles for a Federal territory was carefully selected.
When this event happened the Sydney Evening
News was troubled with fears lest people might
think 1000 square miles too much, and it spoke
words of comfort. It was anxious to get the
matter settled lest some new Federal Govern-
ment might come in and upset the whole swindle,
or lest the fraud might be found out, or some-
thing like that, so it urged politicians in general
not to make a fuss. As a reason why they
shouldn’t fuss it assured them that a great
deal of the proposed Federal area was so
poor, sterile, rugged and uninhabitable that it
really wasn’t worth fussing about; it might as
well be given away a& not. This was rather rough
on the amazing Senator Russell of S.A., who
said that he voted for the place on account of its
great fertility ; it was a rich place, according to
this bucolic humorist, who apparently reckoned
that oats were to flourish in the main street of
the Federal city, and cows to fatten at the door
of the Treasury. One of the gorgeous lies or con-
fidence tricks on which the Yassberra site
originally prospered was its alleged proximity to
that prospective inland sea, the Barren Jack reser-
voir, and another was the alleged fine scenery of
Lake George—which dries up regularly. Both
these narratives or confidence tricks have fallen
through. It was found impossible to put a
Federal capital anywhere within many miles of
Barren Jack, because of the polluted water there-
abouts, and it couldn’t be planted anywhere close
to the alleged scenery of Lake George—which is
often dried up—because there is no reliable drink-
ing supply in the neighborhood. These, two
alleged features of the Yassberra capital perished
miserably, and there was no good in them.
* * * *
So the proposed Federal Territory crawled
away southward, looking for water. In the end
it was found necessary to mark out a long, nar-
row piece of ground like a bashed crescent, in
order to take in the watersheds of two little
trickles called the Cotter and the Molonglo. The
curiously narrow and bashed shape of the piece of
ground is bound to produce one serious result.
Wherever in it the Federal city is placed, the new
land values created by the expenditure of the
money of all Australia must needs slop over the
restricted Federal limits, and go to enrich the
private landlord across the State border. This is
a drawback ; still, in the struggle to get a reason-
ably clean drink for a wretchedly ill-placed city,
drawbacks must be faced. The Federal capital at
Yassberra is to depend for its water-supply chiefly
on the Cotter. Last year, according to N.S.W. Pre-
mier Wade’s official engineer, the Cotter yielded
rather more water than is used by either Sydney
or Melbourne. But, in order to arrive at this
cheerful and more or less dubious conclusion, the
engineer had to omit three most essential points :
(1) During the past year the rainfall at the record-
ing station nearest to the proposed site was
while the average is only 25in., and in the last
drought-year it got down to 13in. Therefore,
though there was enough water in the Cotter
during the last very wet year to supply a big city,
things are liable to be tight in a normal year, and
in a drought year they are liable to be dreadful.
(2) The engineer made no allowance for evapora-
tion, and the evapon*tion of a reservoir in Aus-
tralia has been known to absorb six-sevenths
of the water. Therefore the statement that the
Cotter has yielded 37,000,000ga110ns aday (in agood
year) might mean that about 0,000,000 gallons would
be available for human consumption (Sydney uses
24,000,000 gallons daily and Melbourne 31,000,000
gallons). And in a dry year like 1902 the water
supply would diminish and the evaporation in-
crease; and the supply might easily get down
very far below 6,000,000 gallons. (3) The engineer,
in his struggles to make the Cotter look a suffi-
cient river, made no mention of the demand for
water to supply power for driving machinery.
Also he didn’t mention that, in order to carry the
Cotter fluid to the proposed city, it will probably
have to be pumped up to a height of 650 ft. —an
enormously costly proceeding, which would be
quite needless if a less insane sight were selected.
* » * *
The Federal port at Jervis Bay was one of the
notable advantages which were put forward
as a reason for the selection of Yassberra. Con-
cerning Jervis Bay, the Federal naval command-
ant says cautiously that it has some advantages,
but he makes little disguise of his opinion that
there is at least one better harbor further south.
But even the Sydney commercial folk don’t en-
thuse about Jervis Bay and Yassberra quite as
much as they did. An idea begins to grow up
that the establishment of a rival port within 87
miles of Sydney, to intercept, in course of time,
all the southern trade that now comes to the State
capital, may be more like an act of suicide than
the brilliant hunk of statesmanship which the
Sydney daily papers represented it to be. Then
the proposed Federal territory has crawled away
south in search of water till the tail of it has
climbed, after all, up into the Monaro country
wherein Dalgety stands —in fact, it has got so
close to Dalgety that it is just far enough away to
miss the level country for building on, the splendid
water and water power supply of the Snowy
River, and the proximity of the picturesque
Kosciusko range. It has even got so close
that one of the Yassberra-ite papers has sug-
gested, as a recommendation for the alleged
glorious Yassberra capital, that electric power
can be brought there by wire from the
allegedly-accursed Dalgety on the Snowy River
—brought at much needless expense, seeing
that the capital might as well be planted
on the Snowy, as originally proposed, with the
water power at its door. To deposit a capital in
a place where it may have to pump its scanty
water supply up 650 ft. and bring its electric
power a number of miles by wire, when it might
have several times the amount of water by gravita-
tion close at hand, and find abundant electric
power in its back-yard, seems foolish. In fact,
the whole affair seems foolish.
* * * *
Hugh Mahon’s Federal camp at Yassberra
was, as already mentioned, something of a failure.
Still he got a few members to go and view the
scenery, and report thereon. Here is the state-
ment of Mahon’s own colleague, Hutchison, of
South Australia :
The surroundings of the Mugga Mugga site—the best I
saw—are beautiful, but the great consideration in select-
ing a site is an adequate water supply for drinking and
for power. This the district does not possess. EXPERTS
SAY THAT COTTER CREEK COULD BE MADE TO PRO-
VIDE ONLY ABOUT 3000 HORSE POWER FOR LIGHT-
ING THE NEW CITY BY ELECTRICITY, OR THE
DRIVING OF MACHINERY, WITHOUT LEAVING
ANY WATER FOR DOMESTIC PURPOSES. The supply
could be obtained only by constructing a weir 200 ft. high.
The water would then have to be lifted 650 ft., and carried
a distance of 30 miles to the city in a pipe line along the
ranges crossing a deep gully.
The Murrumbidgee River—already a badly-polluted
stream—will ultimately have most of its water dammed
back in the Barren Jack storage scheme. The Quean-
bey an River might be utilised for power if the Cotter
were used for the city’s water supply ; but that would
mean two great expensive water schemes.
To my mind, the place does not compare with the
Dalgety district. It would be necessary to sink from
12ft. to 20ft. to get a solid foundation for buildings in
Canberra, whilst at Dalgety, where the formation is of
decomposed granite, the foundations would be ideal for a
big city.
In climate, too, the extreme records at Yass-Canberra
are lower than at Dalgety. ... I saw very little agri-
cultural country, but myriads of rabbits.
Again, the cost of the Canberra site would be some-
thing like £1,250,000, as compared with about half that
sum for the Dalgety area. The difference in the outlay
would be sufficient to more than pay the whole cost of
the work connected with the provision of water for both
power and domestic purposes.
And this was the verdict of another Labor member
—Mathews, of Melbourne Ports:—
As compared with Dalgety the Yass-Canberra site is a
most unfortunate selection. It is a pretty enough place,
but from the point of view of water supply I say that to
use the site would be one of the biggest crimes ever per-
petrated. I say, after my visit, that the taunt, “ water-
less Canberra,” is true.
And the Owe’Sullivan, who long represented
that district in the N.S.W. Assembly and should
know it well, writes to the press to state that in
all the selected 1000 square miles there are only
three scraps of level ground, and that —
It is one of the worst sites in the world for a capital
city.
So the bottom drops out of the Yassberra fraud.
The newspapers invented the popular clamor for
a Yassberra capital, just as they invented the
popular clamor against Socialism, the universal
craving to present Britain with a Dreadnought,
and the great financial reputation of William
McMillan. The dearth of subscriptions, which is
the true test, is fast bursting up the Dreadnought
myth. A general election burst up the Anti-Sosh
lie. A referendum, if Prime Minister Fisher had
the courage to insist on one, would almost certainly
burst up the Yassberra delusion. As to the
McMillan financial phantom, it burst naturally.
rebuilt —when things reach this state of panic it
becomes fairly certain that, while the tension lasts
(and it may last many veiirs), Britain won’t want to
send away any serviceable part of its sea forces to
the far ends of the globe, not even to save Aus-
tralia from perdition. And these statements,
large as they are, don’t fully express the situation.
Germany has just risked a war with Russia in
order to force that country to consent to Austria’s
definite annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
and has practically bulldozed Britain, Russia,
France and Servia into recognising the annexa-
tion. It is presumed that Austria is to do some-
thing in return, and a common theory is that the
something will be the loan of the Austrian fleet
when wanted. And Austria is also building a
few Dreadnoughts. Of course, Austria is much
given to astonishing the world by its ingratitude,
and it may do so again. On the other hand, it
may not.
* * * *
Therefore the situation seems to be something
as follows : Britain will, possibly, keep the com-
mand of the European seas, but by a very narrow
margin and only by a rigid process of concentra-
tion. That is to say, it may be able to defend us
against any serious attack by any fleet coming
from Europe, for, barrirf. accidents, it could
intercept a European squadron bound this way
without taking its ships out of its own narrow
seas. But against any attack, great or small,
from Asia, or North or South America, or against
any casual European force which may dodge the
British sea armaments, we are expected to
defend ourselves. And if we neglect to
do so the inward —and perhaps the outward
—language of J. 801 l will be terrible and
richly deserved. For he will then have to
admit, almost to a certainty, that his arm is
shortened, that he can no longer hold his remote
dependencies, and that instead of ruling the five
oceans he is only supreme, and precariously
supreme at that, in European waters. And
further he will suffer grievously by the loss of
Australasian trade, by the damage done to his in-
vestments here, and possibly by the stoppage of
the interest payments on the Australasian public
debt, combined with the further loss which he
must suffer when his great mass of Australasian
securities slump to £2O or so.
> « « - *
And at this serious moment the British Govern-
ment is interrupted by Joe Wakd’s offer of a
Dreadnought—or possibly two Dreadnoughts. As
the offer doesn’t cover wages of officers and crew,
ammunition, repairs, etc., while the vessels last,
two Dreadnoughts, viewed in this light, are really
only about equal to one Dreadnought. TheMaori-
land offer is, conspicuously and glaringly, a substi-
tute for local defence; therefore, Bull’s commerce
in Maoriland waters, and the £100,000,000 or
£150,000,000, or so, which he has lent to Maori
land publicly and privately, will apparently re-
main unprotected. Bull has probably a very clear
idea that he will be expected to lend the money
with which to build Maoriland’s ironclad gift; and
someof him has probably a sort of conviction at the
back of his mind that unless these countries learn
to defend themselves he might as well give the
money right off, for the day an enemy
begins to rage round amid the long wash
of Australasian seas, and interrupt our com-
merce, our securities will be almost waste
paper, and no one knows how long _ they may
remain in that condition. And if £300,000,000 or
more of Australasian securities were to do a fear-
some slump on the London Stock Exchange, and
started a general panic in stocks and shares and
even in British consols, all through our neglect of
local defence, Bull would probably lose more than
the price of twenty Dreadnoughts. In fact, the
money scarcity that would be thus caused might
seriously hamper his own defence. There was
once a war time when Britain had to sell £214
worth of securities for £IOO in order to raise the
wind, and it certainly doesn’t want to meet with
that experience again. Especially it doesn’t want
to meet it through a needless panic which origi-
nated in the fact that, despite all hints, a fool de-
pendency, which might have defended itself,
refused to do so. One or two Dreadnoughts,
built with J. Bull’s own money, would be a poor
consolation if three or four hundred millions of his
Australasian securities became, for a time, mere
pipe-lights, and that just when the sinews of war
were badly required.
* * * <
Moreover, Maoriland’s gift is offered amid such
a blizzard of enthusiasm and congratulation, that
J. Bull probably feels that he will look like a
monster of ingratitude if he doesn’t provide for
the Dominion’s defence in the hour of need
whether he can conveniently do so or not. He is
to receive the mere shells of one or two Dread-
noughts, but there is so much devotion and loose
hurrah attached to the proceedings that it would
look like a shameful act of desertion if he didn’t
send four such vessels, with officers, crews, ammu-
nition, stores, and all other sundries, to save
Maoriland should that place get into desperate
trouble. It isn’t a pleasant feeling. The sort of
fleet which Australia and Maoriland could raise—
if they did, in proportion to their numbers, as
Bull does himself—might, provided it were
stationed permanently in these waters, knock
out any probable assailant, thereby saying
Britain the loss of, it may be, hundreds of millions
of money and a great deal of prestige. In the
absence of such a local fleet, let us suppose what
seems practically impossible, and imagine that
Britain did send out a squadron to save us from
an enemy. It would have to be a larger squadron
than would be required locally, for there is a great
difference between the position of a fleet acting on
its own base, with its own land defences and coal
supplies behind it, and a fleet coming out on the
loose on a 12,000-miles voyage, with no certainty
that it won’t find, when it reaches its destination,
the coal supplies and harbor fortifications in an
enemy’s hands. And even if that squadron
should start, and should arrive, and should con-
quer, the chances are that during the period
occupied on the foolish, needless voyage, several
hundred millions of Bull’s good money would have
gone in loss of commerce, loss of interest on the
Australasian public debt, stock exchange slump,
and destruction or depreciation of British-owned
property in Australasia. For it must be re-
membered that, just because this country has, in
proportion to population, far more securities
floating around in the British market than any
other community on earth, therefore any disaster
which fell upon us and depreciated these
securities would hit J. Bull a knock quite out of
proportion to our numbers. All this is saying
nothing of the money Britain would spend on the
relief expedition, and the extra risk to Britain itself
while the relief squadron was away, and the extra
stock exchange slump caused by that extra risk.
But the chances are very many to one that no such
squadron would ever start while the European
situation remains as at present, and that Bull
would decide, in view of the precarious position in
Europe, to put up with the loss of money and
prestige, and the loss of a big dependency, rather
than throw good cash after bad. It is a pro
foundly complicated situation, but when it is
viewed in all its aspects, it is no wonder if Prime


Minister Asquith rages inwardly at the blatant
Dominion which won’t prepare to defend either
itself or all the millions that Britain has lent it,
and which instead presents an embarrassing iron-
clad and thus draws a bill on J. Bull’s gratitude
which will quite probably have to be dishonored.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Australian Railways and Territory
League.
A movement is taking shape in the centre and
west of Australia to hustle three great questions
along. So far as can be ascertained, there is in
the Australian Parliament a majority which
recognises that the transfer of the Northern Terri-
tory to the Commonwealth is a matter of the
utmost urgency ; that the transcontinental railway
to Kalgoorlie' and Perth is desperately needed,
both for the development of the country and as a
means of defence ; and that the straight line to Port
Darwin is absolutely essential for the same
reasons. Yet, despite the urgency and despite
the apparent majority, the difficulty experienced
in getting anything to really happen is very great.
Under the curse of Party Government very little
does happen, as a rule. Of the crowd which re-
cognises how absolutely essential to Australia are
the two big railways and the transfer of the Terri-
tory, part follows Cook, and it doesn’t want to
see the work done by Deakin or Fisher ; part
follows Fisher, and it probably doesn’t want to see
the work done by Cook or Deakin ; part follows
Deakin, and most likely it has no great desire to
see the work done by Cook or Fisher. Thus the
curse of Party Government paralyses the move-
ment at the very outset. Then there has been
further paralysis through the coldness of the 13. A.
members towards the Westralian line, and the
coldness of the Westralian members towards the
S.A. line. Each party has foolishly regarded the
other as a rival instead of a friend, though both
parties are toiling in the same cause—the cause of
the Lost Provinces, of the great unpeopled, unde-
veloped, undefended section of Australia. This
has led to more delay. And there has been
further obstruction from the usual Congested
Population Party. This party holds that every
effort should be made to bring population and
trade, not to the places which are empty and un-
developed, but to those which have practically all
the trade and population already. This is the
party which believes in greasing the fat pig
because it is greasy already, and in taking coals
to Newcastle because there is plenty of coal
there now. In the pursuit of its usual policy,
some of it wants to deviate the Port Augusta-Port
Darwin railway through Western Queensland, and
round by Hergott Springs, though this would
mean taking it through the great Cooper’s Creek
depression, where in wet seasons there is a vast
inland sea, 12ft. deep or more in places, and where
it would require nearly 150 miles of viaducts or
embankments or trestles to keep the railway’s
head above water. And some more of the Con-
gested Population Party wants to build 600 extra
miles of railway in order to carry the Port Darwin
line straight to Sydney and Melbourne, which
means that the railway which is to be
built ostensibly to develop the Territory
would make all possible haste out of the
Territory, and leave it undeveloped after
all. It has all been a long, wearisome,
selfish, shiftless muddle, and at last the Centre
and West have grown tired of waiting for a
definite answer. Therefore there has arisen at
Adelaide the Australian Railways and Territory
League, with Simpson Newland, David Lindsay
and other prominent men as leading spirits. The
idea is to build up a combination of the politi-
cians, the newspapers, and the leading citizens of
S.A. and Westralia. The business of the poli-
ticians will be to demand that the Northern
Territory be taken over by the Commonwealth,
and that the two railways be authorised simul-
taneously and commenced simultaneously, and on
these matters the Federal members from the two
States, whether they follow Cook or Deakin or
Fisher, are asked to stand together and refuse to
separate their interests under any circumstances.
There is no idea of trying to force anybody to
vote for the Northern Territory transfer or for the
building of the railways, unless he believes in
these proceedings, but there is a fixed idea of get-
ting from Parliament a definite Yes or No on
three urgent questions which have long been in a
state of suspended animation owing to party
squabbles, the hunt for portfolios, and other side
issues. If the answer is Yes, then the matter
will be settled. If it is No, then S.A. will with-
draw the offer of the Territory, and do what it
can in its own small way to develop that Lost
Province rather than leave it for an indefinite
period the empty wilderness it is now ; and the
question of the two great Federal railways will be
abandoned. And if the attempt to get a definite
answer from the Australian Parliament fails, and
next session ends with the matter still hung up,
then also S.A. proposes to withdraw its offers.
The position has become so serious that it is the
duty of every politician who takes an interest in
the defence and development of Australia to join
t he League and shove it along to the best of his
ability. It is the cause of all Australia that is at
stake.

The N.S.W. State Frighter Starts to Realise
Things.
Thus a Sydney Evening News correspondent
(30/3/’O9): —
Why does the Melbourne Government want that 1000
square miles for a capital, and why does it leant Jervis
Bayl Do not let us forget that Federation was con-
ceived and born in Melbourne, that Federation is Mel-
bourne from Melbourne, by Melbourne, and always for
Melbourne. Do not let us forget that in the past Mel-
bourne filched from Sydney the mail service. Do not let
us forget how they fooled us into this cursed thing called
Federation, and so do not let us wake up some morning
to find the mail steamers forbidden to go further than
Jervis Bay, if that be made the Federal port.
There is a type of demented State Frighter in
N.S.W. who is ready to ascribe every local mishap
to “Melbourne influences.” As the Pope of
Rome is to Dill, so the capital of Victoria is to
the Sydney State Fright brand of citizen. He
holds that the Victorian who lives by the Yarra is
filled with an undying hatred of Sydney, and
yearns to do it a mischief. As a type he is as old
as sin, as dull as holiness. The letter quoted
above is the usual old outburst, but it has a new
significance. It takes a new point of view,
and that gives it interest. Six months ago
there was a solid majority, both in the Australian
Parliament and the Senate, in favor of a Federal
capital site at Dalgety, with a Federal port at
Twofold Bay. Then the battlers against so-called
“Melbourne interests” girded up their slacks,
and the underground engineers got to work on
behalf of the poor ill-used old Ma State, and amid
an overpowering aroma of deadness and corruption,
Yass and Canberra, which had never been able to
secure much support individually, were declared
to be in unison the best that could be done in the
way of a capital site for all Australia. Followed
a yell of joy from the Sydney press. Yass-
berra, with Jervis Bay for a Federal port,
was upheld as “an ideal site.” The
Telegraph reproduced immense photographs of
Jervis Bay, and emphasised that among East
Australian ports it was surpassed by Sydney alone.
J. 0. Watson and W. Morris Hughes were
bracketed with Willy Kelly and Bill Wilks as
saviours of their State. All was cheerfulness
and triumph. All was gas and gaiters. True,
there bobbed up, from time to time, people who,
knowing Yassberra, demurred somewhat to the
general rejoicing; but to them it was demon-
strated that even if the place was typhoid-smitten
at regular intervals owing to a defective water-
supply, and blisteringly cold in winter, and of
a Sheol-like heat in summer, all these dis-
abilities were compensated for by the fact that
Sydney had “scored,” and “Melbourne in-
terests ” had been dealt a severe smack in the
eye. Yet in a little while carking doubts began
to obtrude as to whether Sydney really had scored
so extensively over the Yassberra selection and all
it connoted, as the N.S.W. dailies alleged.
The man in the tram started pointing out
in increasing numbers to the person beside him
that, in point of hard, cold fact, whatever good a
Federal capital and a Federal seaport up against
Sydney’s back-door was going to do to the big Syd-
ney newspaper proprietaries it wasn’t going to
benefit any other sort of harbor-side business
much. On the contrary. Twofold Bay, the
natural port of the Dalgety site, would never, he
argued, have rivalled or even competed with
Sydney. Being 300 miles away it would only
have taken, at the worst, a Gippsland-Monaro
trade with which Sydney is hardly concerned at
all. The aggrandisement of Jervis Bay, on the
other hand, by means of Commonwealth railways
and influence and things—an inevitable result of
the fixing of the capital site at Yassberra—was pal-
pably another affair. A Federal Port at Jervis Bay
must mean (it is still the tram-frequenter who is
arguing) that the great mail steamers travelling
North via Perth, Adelaide and Melbourne, and
the coasters from the Southern States, will halt
four-score miles short of Port Jackson with
disastrous results to Sydney trade. The Capital
Site-Capital Port line will tap a huge railway
system which at present carries to Sydney the
entire trade from Deniliquin to Goulburti, and
from Condobolin to Cooma. In a word, a Federal
site at Yassberra, with its necessary complement,
a Federal port at Jervis Bay, can’t hurt Melbourne,
which is too far away to have its trade interfered
with, but it is going, in due course, to do an
appalling amount of damage to Sydney. It is an
appreciation of those plain facts that is now
causing the people who sign themselves “ Anti-
Melbourneite,” “Loyalist,” “Secessionist,” and
so forth when they write to the State
Frights papers, to start arguing that not
sturdy patriotism, as originally alleged, but
“ Melbourne interests ” were responsible for the
selection of the Yassberra capital site and port.
It is likely that the anomalous spectacle may yet
be witnessed of Willy Kelly being turned down
with loathing by his bagmen constituents in
Wentworth on the ground that, by supporting the
Yassberra infamy, he deliberately conspired with
“the Melbourne Government ” to ruin bydney.

Fisher’s Policy—so Far as It Has Got.
When Prime Minister Fisher delivered his policy
speech at Gympie (Q.), he struck the attitude of
the strong democrat—so far as he went. If he
and his party live up to the Gympie policy, their
political life, whether long or short, will be honor-
able. Certainly there are points—a good many
points—on which the Government’s programme
might be more satisfactory and more democratic
than it is, but it is a good programme so far as it
goes, and, if backed by courage and efficiency, it
is calculated to make history. Andrew Fisher
advocates compulsory military training, an en-
largement of the naval defence programme, the
prompt appointment of an Australian High Com-
missioner in London, local coinage of silver, and
a progressive land tax on all estates exceeding
£5OOO in value. The tax is to start at Id. in the £
on the estate worth £5OOl, and range up to 4d. in
the £ on the property worth £50,001 or over, with
an extra impost of Id. in the £ in the case of the
absentee, in order to drive capital back to the
country. This progressive land-tax proposal
in itself would make a fairly efficient
stock-in-trade for a Democratic Ministry.
It means the opening up of the great waste
areas, the turning of grass and desolation
into inhabitants, a great increase of population,
a great rush of-immigrants (for there are hundreds
of thousands of them to be got if Australia only has
land tooffertliem), a vastenlargementof thenumber
of taxpayers, a consequent expansion of revenue,
more men for defence, more money for defence
and for railway building and for Northern Terri-
tory settlement—in fact, a progressive land-tax
of the size proposed means almost everything.
Mr. Fisher also advocates the settlement of the
financial problem between the Commonwealth
and the States by an allotment to the State
Treasurers of £5,000,000 a year out of the Customs
and Excise revenue. The amount may seem
almost recklessly liberal, but for the sake of arriv-
ing at a settlement it may be worth while to be
recklessly liberal. Also the Prime Minister
is in favor of the taking over and development of
the Northern Territory ; and there, unfortunately,
he comes nearly to the end of his budget. In the
matter of the Federal capital he still seems to be
a foolish Yassberra-ite and a member of the Con-
gested Population Party. He doesn’t commit him-
self in any definite way on the immediate con-
struction of the two transcontinental railways, yet
without them any defence scheme is little more
than dust and ashes, so far as the biggest part of
Australia is concerned. . And he seems to regard
a Commonwealth note-issue as a device for raising
current revenue, .rather than as a means for the
gradual obliteration of the existing State debts.
The difference in these two aspects of the case
may not look very great, but it is really tremend-
ous. If the Commonwealth issues notes for cir-
culation purposes, and uses any profit that may
arise out of the business as revenue, it is con-
fronted with the great difficulty that it may
be rushed at any time with a large demand
for gold in exchange for its notes, and it will
have no fund out of which to meet that
demand save its gold reserve—probably 20
per cent, on its note issue. On the other hand, if
it adopts the Canadian plan of requiring every
bank to hold 40 per cent, of its cash reserves in
Federal paper money, it will thereby get the use
of about £10,000,000, and unless there is a fear-
some slump in the cash reserves of the banks, it
can’t be rushed for payment in gold of any pro-
portion of its paper, and even in a time of con-
siderable slump the demand can’t be large. Then
if it keeps, say, £2,000,000 in gold as a reserve,
and invests the other £8,000,000 in the purchase of
State securities, it will have, even in the first year
of the new system, a reserve against its notes of
20s. in the £ —4s. in gold and 16s. in State securi-
ties. And as the fund grows through the collec-
tion of the interest on these State securities, and
the investment of the money thus received on the
purchase of more State securities, the position
will improve till the £10,000,000 or so of
Federal paper money is guaranteed by £2,000,000
in gold, and £200,000,000 or £250,000,000 or more
of State securities. There is no possible room for
a charge of wild-cat financing about that sort of
note issue ; but any device which simply aims at
putting a certain quantity of Government paper
in circulation, and keeping a small gold reserve
against it, and using the profits of the business as
current revenue—well, it may not be wild-cat to
start with, but there is always a fear that it may
develop into wild-cat later on, when some Gillies
or Waddell happens to get a spell at the Federal
Treasury. And however tame Fisher’s cat may
be (it isn’t a very well-defined cat as yet) it seems
a grievous pity that the chance to pay off all our
debts out of nothing should be neglected.
The Common Sense of William Kidston.
Thebe have been times when The Bulletin has
felt unfriendly towards William Kidston, State
Premier of Queensland, yet the language which
he lately used towards Premier Wade of N.S. W.
about the latter person's incessant meddling with
Federal affairs covers a multitude of sins. Wade’s
conviction seems to be that a State Premier is a
sort of honorary member of the Australian Parlia-
ment and an interfering small brother to the Aus-
tralian Ministry ; that the 90 members of the
N.S.W. Assembly, and the 61 members of
the Queensland Assembly, and so on, are
really so many honorary units of the Aus-
tralian House of Representatives ; and that
it is the general business of every State to be a
grandmother or elderly maiden aunt to the
Australian Government, and dole out its
pocket money, and wipe its nose, and
put it to bed at 9 p.m., and fill the
part of a stout, well-meaning hen mothering a
baby elephant. Gkegoby Wade, in leality, is
only a single, solitary Federal elector with just
the same authority and voting power in Federal
matters as Smith, the bottle-oh, of Newtown,
Sydney ; or Jones, the hawker, of Collingwood,
Melbourne; or Robinson, who is hunting for
gold outcrops in the wildernesses of Kimberley,
Westralia. But Wade can’t get rid of the idea
that because he is a State Premier he should regu-
larly advise the Australian Government about
finance, defence, banking legislation, transcon-
tinental railways, the tariff, and so on. Lately he
got excited over defence questions, and requested
the other State Premiers to join him in being even
more of a Bumble or Dogberry or Barto-
line Saddletree to the Commonwealth than
usual, and William Kidston, of Queensland,
replied in a long, plain, sensible, Scotch letter.
Some extracts are appended :
There are two rival policies before the Federal Parlia-
ment concerning naval defence. On the one hand it is
maintained that Australia should discontinue her subsidy
to the Imperial fleet, and concentrate tier efforts in build-
ing up an Australian navy. On the other hand, it is con-
tended that we should not attempt to buildan Australian
navy ; but that we should continue and greatly increase
our subsidy to the Imperial fleet. Which of the two
policies the Federal Government adopts is a matter with
which, as State Ministers, we have, I contend, nothing to
do. We have, of course, the same right as others to hold
an opinion on the question, but as State Ministers we
have no claim to interfere in any way with the particular
policy of defence adopted by the Federal Parliament....
The particular policy of naval defence adopted by the
Federal Parliament, and the way they spend their money
for that purpose, may reflect on their wisdom or ability.
It has little to do with the question of their loyalty. Our
loyalty is to be measured by the amount of sacrifice we
make rather than by the particular way in which we
make it. I hold the opinion that the right of self-
government entails the duty of self-defence, and that
Australia should face that dutv in a way she has
failed to do hitherto, .NOT ‘IN A SPASMODIC,
THEATRICAL MANNER, but by deliberately un-
dertaking the burden of her own defence. Know-
ing how greatly Australia has hitherto failed in
this first duty to herself and to the empire, I
have little sympathy with those who, under the stress of
a sudden scare, wish to make it appear as if they were
generously rushing to help the Mother Country in her
hour of need. We might make some effort to be just
before we claim to be generous. . . .
The duty of attracting settlers to fill our empty spaces
is one that devolves on the State Governments, for they
own the lands, and the railways which make the lands
accessible. Before the State Governments begin to in-
struct the Federal Government as to the policy to
pursue, they might consider whether they are carrying
out their own duty as regards the defence of Australia ;
whether it would not be better if they devoted themselves
and all their available finances to the filling of those
empty lands with men, leaving' the Federal Government
to carry out its own particular duties regarding defence.
If each will sweep before his own door the whole street
will be clean.
That is the largest lump of ice that has been
dropped on the fevered brow of Unauthorised
State Interference up to date. And it should do
the hectic animal a lot of good.

The Eternal Trader.
G. S. Littlejohn, president of the Sydnej -
Chamber of Commerce, discharged the following
shot (l/4/’O9) at the Australian Government’s
Defence scheme:—
The Defence policy proposed by Mr. Fisher is equiva-
lent to the setting of a child with toy guns to fight a full-
grown, well-armed man ; and his only reason for so doing
is that it is his own child who ought to learn, to fight.
How foolish when another full-grown man, thoroughly
equipped and trained, is willing to fight his battles for
him in consideration of reasonable payment.
Which indicates yet again that a man may be an
accomplished importer, shopkeeper or what not,
and withal an indifferent historian. From those
early days when civilisation was still in its swad-
dling clothes, right down to modern times, it has
been demonstrated at short intervals that the
child-nation which employs a full-grown-man
nation to fight for it, “in consideration of reason-
aide payment,” must go down with a horrible thud.
Egypt dropped defending itself when it grew rich.
Under Amasis it could afford to buy from Babylon,
for a fixed annual subsidy, a sort of safety, and it
did so joyfully. In a little while Egypt saw its
temples destroyed, its priests scourged, its
honored dead outraged, and its rulers humiliated.
Persia, which had been inviolate so long as it was
a nation in arms, laid down the sword and
took to trading ; and in due course Alexander
entered its capital. There came a time when the
army of the Carthaginian republic was composed
entirely of mercenaries—men who defended
Carthage “in consideration of reasonable pay-
ment.” Carthage was rich. It had money
enough to hire armies and to build any number of
the great seven-deckers, which were the Dread-
noughts of the day. But Carthage couldn’t tight
on its own behalf, and so it fell. When Rome
was at its wealthiest, when an Imperial
dinner cost more than a Yankee millionaire’s
most lavish London Savoy banquet costs to-day,
the foreigu legions of the frontier marched on the
city which had been wont to pay them, and
sacked it. Peru fell to Pizarko because it was
defenceless. Silesia relied on Bohemia to support
it against the encroachments of Poland, and for
five centuries thereafter it was bandied about
between rival Powers, and used as a cockpit for
their battles. The list might be enlarged inde-
finitely. The doom which smote Korea a few
years ago, because it omitted to arm and de-
pended instead on the protection of a subsidised
suzerain Power, was the same which has, through
all the centuries of history, overwhelmed every
other nation that has pursued the same
policy. It was the doom which befell
the Britons when they hired the Saxons
to defend them, and it was probably the
fate which befell the missing link when he
first came down from his tree and paid the plesi-
osaurus three cocoanuts per week to protect him
from the foxolophodon. The case of Australia to
day in no wise differs from the case of those
unhappy Powers in the past, whose stars set in so
hideous a riot of blood and rapine. Australia is
autonomous, as they were. It is rich and desir-
able. It is menaced by countries whose large
populations clamor for an outlet. The painful
analogy may be carried further. Always when a
mercenary-guarded nation has grown nervous—
which it has mostly done when it was too late —
its traders, importers, presidents of Chambers of
Commerce and so forth—in a word, its Little-
johns—have rushed into the market place and
rent their clothes, or tail-coat, or plug-hat, and
implored their rulers not to be guilty of the mad-
ness of taking on their shoulders the fighting job
at which the suzerain country was so demon-
strably superior. It is a characteristic of your
born commercial or bagman type —whether ancient
Persian or modern Australian—who has once con-
tracted the evil habit of hiring mercenaries, that
he has always thereafter been able to enthuse
about being defended, for cash value, by someone
else ; and has never been able to grasp that his
own countrymen could be of the least value as
fighting men. The arrival of him in any numbers
in the public places of cities has always presaged
disaster. Australia’s hope in the present instance
is that Littlejohn is a rare specimen.

The Homing Chickens.
The two German Powers (Germany and Austria), with
11,000,000 men and 20 Dreadnoughts building, have
thwarted the Triple Entente (Britain, France, and
Russia). — London Daily Mail.
The German Ambassador had only to remind the
Russian Minister that Austria was Germany’s ally to con-
jure up visions of invasion. The result was panic sub-mis-
sion, and Russia has sacrificed her manifest destiny as the
head of the Slav race in Europe. The two German Powers
dictate to Europe by sheer weight of arms. More or less
abjectly, Europe replied politely that the Berlin Treaty
was entirely at Austria’s disposal, and that none of the
signatories would dream of enforcing its provisions. . . .
The Times is perfectly right in connecting all this with
the fate of Britain’s sea-power. The Balkans stand as a
lesson to all Europe.—S. M. Herald.
When, awhile back, Austria tare up almost the
last remnant of the Berlin Treaty by annexing
Bosniaand Herzegovina—provinces which racially,
and for other reasons, belong to Servia—few
people, outside diplomatic circles anyway,
seemed to recognise that the breakage was merely
one more scene in a tragedy that opened many
miles from Austria’s frontiers. And when, the
other day, Servia, which was ready to
fight in the last ditch to prevent itself
being squeezed off the map, and to lead the van
in defence of the violated Berlin Treaty if only
the other signatories to the Treaty (notably
Britain and Russia) would give the word—when
Servia, forsaken by its allies, handed in its sub-
mission to Austria, even then the whyness of
the catastrophe was, apparently, not gene-
rally seen. Yet it is fairly plain that
the wreckage of the Berlin Treaty didn’t
happen altogether when Austria seized the two

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
At a leading club in Wellington, on Monday night,
members were standing 60 deep around that interesting
portion of the furniture whereat refreshments are dis-
pensed, drinking champagne and cheering Premier Ward.
The various loeal bodies, the Chambers of Commerce,
Stock Exchanges, prominent clergymen, leading poli-
ticians, both members and ex-members of Parliament
were represented.— News item, Sl/S/’OH.
It is a club in Wellington
(In Wellington, M.L.) ;
Around the bar the members crowd,
And drink and cheer like h—ll.
Mark yonder white-haired citizen
Who howls “Go ’ ome ? No pear ! ”
None can avoid observing that
The oldster’s on his ear.
He waves a champagne bottle in
His agitated grip,
And inadvertently destroys
A fellow-member’s nip.
Likewise he dances heavily,
And sings a vinous stave
Anent the Flag that dominates
The battle and the wave.
You would not think that normally
Sin fills his soul with hate ;
And that each Sabbath he hands round
A kirk collection plate.
See the stout baldhead near the door
Who sways amid a mass
Of well-primed friends, and weeps and weeps
With dolor in his glass,
And only stops and dries his eyes
At intervals to say,
“ Gor save the Empire ! Fill ’em up !
’Ere’s luck, boys ! ’lp ’ooray ! ”
None who was unacquainted with
The island’s social life
Would judge he played a leading part
In anti-liquor strife.
About the bar, on tables, chairs,
Where’er one’s optics light,
They cheer, and fight, and yell for drinks—
And England and the Right.
The press stands by in reverence,
Absorbs the glowing scene,
Then wires it broadcast, that the world
May realise how mean,
Unpatriotic, soulless, low,
It looks when placed beside
The land where Prohibition, Ward,
And holiness abide.

And a drunkard’s morning head.

provinces. It happened in part when the Japanese
drove the white regiments out of Mukden. It
happened some more when the Monkey tore the
white man’s flag from the battlements of Port
Arthur. Britain, sooling the brown manikin at
the white man’s throat, helped to wreck the
Berlin Treaty. British newspapers, egging Britain
on in the evil work, helped to wreck it also.
The fowl comes home to roost by a simple though
circuitous process of arithmetical progression.
First, Britain turned dog on its color, allied itself
with the brown against the white, the Asiatic
against the European, the Pagan against the
alleged Christian. It was because of Britain’s
money and teaching and moral support that the
Jap came out on top, and that Russia is still a
good deal of a disorganised wreck to day. And
because Russia is a wreck it had to yield the point
to Germany just when Britain wanted its
aid. As France couldn’t face Germany and
Austria single-handed on land, it also caved in ;
and Britain didn’t want to take on the Triple
Alliance single-handed either, so it caved in.
This might not matter so much but for what
is supposed to lie beyond. It is commonly
believed that the return Germany is to
get for securing Bosnia and Herzegovina to
Austria is the loan of the Austrian navy
when wanted. If so, Germany was able to
earn its reward through the weakness of Russia,
and the weakness of Russia is the direct result of
Britain’s pro-Asiatic and anti-European policy.
In fact, it is the fowl coming home to roost. If
that fowl is the exact bird it is supposed to be,
then Japan, as a dubious friend some 16,000 miles
away, isn’t likely to make up for Austria, with its
fairly-efficient fleet, as a reliable enemy right at
the door—that is, assuming that Japan is even a
friend of any kind, dubious or otherwise, when
the expected row happens. Some of these specu-
lations may be wide of the mark, and may simply
arise from the fact that Bull’s nerves are none
too good just now; but the fact remains that
Britain has had a discussion with. Germany over a
matter which Europe regards as important, and
it was solely by reason of Britain’s pro-Jap policy
that Germany won, and that Britain and its French
ally backed down with some discredit and a sink-
ing sensation at the base of the stomach.

The City of the Unbridled Motor-Hog,
Extract from Sydney Evening News (30/3/’09):
The Paddington police are searching for the driver of a
motor-car which ran into a tram conductor at the
Waverley Depdt on Monday night, and, without waiting
to see the result of the accident, drove off.
About 11.45 p.m., Conductor Charles Ferguson had
just knocked off work, and was sitting on the kerbing
outside the sheds waiting for a homeward-bound tram,
when a motor-car came swiftly along, going in the direc-
tion of the city. Just as the car reached where Ferguson
was sitting, it swerved, and, colliding with the sitting
man, knocked him over and broke his left arm. Without
stopping, the driver of the car continued on his journey.
Fellow conductors of Ferguson took him to St. Vin-
cent’s Hospital, where he was admitted for treatment.
It is the sort of item which emphasises the fact
that Sydney is, just now, one of the most
dangerous places for pedestrians on earth. Its
streets are even narrower than those of London,
and for long-distance traffic there are, very few of
them, though of by-ways and streets that go
nowhere in particular there are abundance. These
narrow ways carry all day and most of the night a
stream of electric trams which whiz round
corners and speed along straight runs at a high
velocity. Through the lack of city railways the
tram-cars have so much business to do that they
must “ velocitate ”to avoid a deadlock. In the
last 18 months the tally of locally-owned motor-
cars has swelled enormously, and the horse-drawn
traffic hasn’t decreased to any extent. Elsewhere,
in like circumstances, the first care of the
authorities has been to lessen the danger-
possibilities on behalf of the greatest number by
drastic legislation. In Europe and in America
the way of the motor-hog has been made hard
with, fines and imprisonment, and pains have
been taken to render his identification easy. Not
so in Sydney. It is one of the few great cities
which has a swift and extensive tram-service, and
no underground or overhead lines to lighten the
burden of street traffic, yet the scorcher—whether
the bicycle, motor-car, or motor-bicycle variety—
goes practically unchecked by the police ; and
even in the rare cases where an inclination is
shown to deal with him, it is mostly found to be
impossible to do so, owing, as in the case above-
quoted, to his juggernaut wearing no distinguish-
ing mark. About six months ago Hughes,
M.L.C., proposed to introduce a measure to pro-
vide for the regulation of the speed of motors and
motor-bicycles, and also for the registration and
the clear numbering of them for identification.
The Tory press fell on the scheme and
rent it. The IS. M. Herald denounced it as “a
Bill to make the lives of motorists miserable.”
It was argued that the desired ends could be
achieved Dy police regulations as effectually as by
any Bill. The police woke up for a week or so ;
the local motor-hog lay low for about the same
period ; and then the good, easy public forgot its
grievance and the Hughes proposal together. In
the last three months the motor-scorching scandal
has assumed bigger dimensions in Sydney and
environs than ever. Fines—ridiculously paltry
by comparison with the means of the road-
hoggers—have been imposed occasionally ; more
often the offender was not laid by the wheels
because he departed over the horizon before
any policeman or other human being was able
to recognise him. A short Act is urgently
required that shall, before anything else, force
every motor-car and inotor-bicyele owner to carry a
large, conspicuous registered number on the back
of his vehicle, and that shall double or treble
the existing fines for careless or incompetent
driving. And it will need to be firmly adminis-
tered. It may irritate a few people, but the
resultant saving in life and limb will compensate
for that.
Yictoria’s New Appeal Court.
Its name is Brown—J. Drysdale Brown. Pre-
mier Murray discovered Brown d reaming on a Leg.
Council bench, and made him Attorney-General.
Otherwise he had never been heard of as a lawyer.
Now he has reached the Bench, and the reason of
his reaching it is one Coleman Isaacs. Isaacs is
a person who was arrested, in close proximity to
another man’s pocket, while in a crowd during
Fleet week. Police Magistrate Cresswkll inter-
viewed him on Sept. 8, and, finding him heavily-
weighted with previous convictions, handed him
six months’ hard labor. Thereupon Isaacs ap-
pealed, and was released on bail. Then began are-
markable series of unaccountable delays and post-
ponements that suggest that Isaacs knows some-
one. His appealshould have been heard mOotober,
but was postponed till November (and Isaacs
remained out on bail). He then informed Judge
Eagleson, through his counsel, that he had for
two months been leading an honest and in-
dustrious life, and wished to be a free man. His
Honor remarked that this was scarcely the sort of
appeal he had anticipated, but, instead of going
on with the case, he adjourned it for another
month to allow Isaacs to petition the Governor
(and Isaacs remained out on bail). At the De-
cember Sessions, Judge Chomley noticed the
original appeal against the six months’ sentence
on the list, and was about to consider it, when
Isaacs’ lawyer repeated the request he had made
to Judge Eagleson. Chomley also remarked
that the proceedings were irregular, refused to
hear the appeal, and postponed the matter till the
February Sessions (and Isaacs remained out on
bail). Next, in some unaccountable way, the
case was adjourned from the February to the March
Sessions (with Isaacs still out on bail). Probably
someone would have kept on adjourning it sine die
(with Isaacs still put on bail), but at this stage
Isaacs told Governor Carmichael, per medium
of a petition, that he had turned over a new leaf,
and desired remission of the sentence. Car-
michael passed the petition on to Attorney-
General J. D. Brown, who desired a ’tec—just
one ’tec—to investigate it. The ’tec’s report
simply stated that, so far as he could ascertain.
Isaacs did not now associate with spielers and
pickpockets, and that he was understood to be
working. Thereupon Attorney-General —or
rather Appeal Court — Brown took Isaacs’
appeal out of the hands of the General
Sessions Judge, heard it himself through
his one detective—and liberated Isaacs by remit-
ting the sentence. Questioned as to this action,
Mr. Justice Brown said that, as Isaacs was
alleged (not on oath) to be working and living
honestly, he was better outside than in gaol.
Which is possibly true, but it entirely fails to
explain why Brown interfered in a case which
was then actually before the Courts, or how the
case came to be so mysteriously postponed-from
month to month for six months, or why Isaacs’
sentence was remitted while that of a mate, who
was sentenced the same day and for the same
offence, wasn’t remitted. Bent, by the way,
was in office when the first appeal to the higher
Court was made and during the earlier postpone-
ments of trials, and it was only when he was fired
out that Isaacs (out on bail all the time) actually
appealed to the Governor. Altogether there is a
loud smfell, as of a Brighton cabbage-garden,
about the matter.
Concerning one item of Prime Minister Fisher’s
Gympie (Q.) speech, the State Frights papers
have preserved a silence like that of the aban-
doned catacomb. Yet it was an important item.
Said Fisher :
There is also the question of the cost of immigration.
We have the effect of the States each advertising its own
part of the Common wealth. To give one or two instances
I will quote from the official handbook of Westralia,
issued in 1908: “The violent fluctuations due to vari-
ability of the seasons in other States have not affected
this State. Our flocks and herds have gone on increasing
steadily when tnose of the Eastern States were decimated
by the great droughts.”
Then Tasmania says : “ The dreaded fruit-fly, which is
doing so much damage on the mainland, is unknown
here. Other States have occasional droughts, and in
summer there are several weeks of intense heat.”
From N.S.W. advertisements I read:—“Speaking of
free grants in other States, it will usually be found that
what costs nothing is worth nothing.”
Finally Victoria says:—“Melbourne is the most
populous city in Australia.”
And so on. These are only little sidelights on the
important matter of advertising.”
Thus do the little State Governments, which
reckon they can do the business better than the
Commonwealth, “advertise Australia.” Yet
some people wonder why Australia doesn’t get
more immigrants. The marvel is that, in face
of the “advertisement” Australia gets from the
little State Governments, any immigrants at all
come to such a blighted, God-forsaken country as
the little State Governments represent Australia
to be.

The quiet little town of Narrabri (N.S.W.) held a
ballot, or State gamble, the other day, to dispose
of seven (7) settlement leases. So awful is the
land hunger these days in a State which has
barely five people to the square mile that the
applicants ran into hundreds, and their cash
deposits amounted to £21,300. One of the three
men who rose up excitedly in a Sydney club, the
other night, and promised £lO,OOO towards the
purchase of a battleship for England, is a great
land monopolist from this same district. He is
one of those who warn the people off the grass—
one of those who keep down population, and pre-
vent immigration, and who furnish a reason why
200,000 British citizens depart annually for foreign
countries, where they take the oath of allegiance
to a foreign Power and where their children
learn to be foreigners and get ready to shoot at
the empire on some future day, when otherwise
they might settle inside the empire, and remain
British subjects, and learn to shoot for the empire.
The big landowner is a picturesque individual
when he leaps to his feet after dinner and says
he will give £lO,OOO for the defence of the British
flag. But there may come a time when the
empire will want 10,000 men a great deal more
than it wants £lO,OOO, and it is the big landowner
who prevents it having those 10,000 men.
“Daiarli”: Jack Howe, ex-clown, ex-bellringer, etc.,
is not dead, as a writer (B. 25/'3/’O9) falsely alleges. On the
contrary. He may be seen almost, any day at Warwick (Q.)
in the vicinity of the local post office, where he assembles
iu force to assimilate the local papers. Jack is aged 80,
and still going very strong indeed.

After 101 full-dress rehearsals in Mel-
bourne, Jack and Jill, and the widow wlio
lived in a shoe, and the scarecrow who had straw
for a liver, and the big rooster and the small
rooster, and the baron and all the rest of the bag
of tricks, arrived at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) last
week. That other ornate show, of which Lord
Dicky Nevill goes in advance, had an official
opening at the Town Hall the same Saturday
evening ; and though the Town Hall performance
attracted the largest expanse of under-dressed
lady and over-dressed shirt, yet Her Majesty’s
bulged with a crowd which mostly took note
of the fact that the pantomime demon begins
his time-honored wrestle with the panto-
mime good fairy at 7-45 sharp. Well before
8 o’clock, however, the demon is elbowed off the
premises; and thereafter he has heaps of time to
wonder what he was doing there at all. Still, in
order that there may be no doubt that it is a
pantomime, he is called in twice for a second or
two —just so that the public may have an excuse
to heave at its rebellious Nonconformist con-
science (“Must take the children to the panto-
mime, you know ”). Also possibly the box-office
has a fragment- of conscience lying about some-
where, and getting, in the way. Anyhow, the
demon is preserved ; though for all practical
purposes he is of no more real im-
portance nowadays than the brace of buttons
that some men wear on the part of their coats
that they can’t see, or the appendix which they
can only see at even more pain and expense.

Already anything can happen in panto-
mime—anything, that is to say, except dulness.
Even that might happen in some pantomimes,
but it is due to a management which really does
wonderful things for Australia to say that it
couldn’t happen in a J. C. Williamson theatre.
The essence of the Williamson pantomime con-
tract is velocity; and in the case of “ Jack
and Jill,” the new “boy,” Miss Stella
Gastelle, provides a large share of the
essence. She puts nearly as much vigor
into her “business” as, later on, Bert Gil-
bert, the baron, does into his patriotic song in
which he tells Australia that it owns, this bit of
the earth, and that by 1915 it is going to own a
considerable fleet of ships to protect it. Coleman
puts on the prophet’s cloak and paints the ships
as a guarantee of good faith. Also, they are going
to be built out of Australia’s own steel. Of course
the audience shouts hooray, or makes a noise to
that effect—and then probably goes home and
decides to vote again for Willy Kelly. Bert Gil-
bert’s excursion into picture-song is, however, the
one outbreak of seriousness in the 3£ hours of
velocity. For 3£ hours, or thereabouts, it
is merely a change from one harmonious
scheme of color to another, with . quips by
the widow and the baron to give the eye time to
rest. They may strike one differently after they
have quipped 100 times ; but at present not even
the most elaborate of these outbreaks is a weari-
ness. As for bright ideas—the real test of modern
pantomime'—“Jack and Jill” owns more than
any other of recent years.
In “The Hypocrites,” which transpired at
Sydney Criterion last Saturday, H. A. Jones sets
out to give a serious picture of a phase of English,
social life. In “ The Case of Rebellious Susan ”
he aims at pure comedy. “ The Masqueraders ”
is romantic drama. “The Hypocrites” is, as it
were, a statement of sordid fact. The people in
it are not particularly witty, but they are real.
The theme is commonplace. The play is a
masterpiece because of its well-nigh perfect tech-
nique, its sincerity and directness, its fine satire,
and, above all, its characterisation. There are
folks, for example, like Mr. Wilmore, lord
of tlie manor of Weybury, all over the
British Isles. They cannot truthfully be said to
exist anywhere else. The typical Ameri-
can of the educated class is too morbidly
conscious of outside opinion to be just the
sort of humbug Wilmore is; the Gaul is too
ribald ; the Teuton too self-analytical. Wilmortfls
magnificent inability to see the virtue of any but
his own side of the case is what makes him so
British and so strong. He may have Ins bad
points, but at least he is splendidly audacious in
his wrong-doing, indomitable m misfortune, and
in prosperity resolute to do, according to his
lights, the right thing by those under him—pro-
vided always that the doing of it doesn’t clash
with his own interests. Dramatic exigencies
render it necessary that Wilmore shall be dis-
credited, and shall realise that he is discredited.
H. A. Jones seems to have felt the unnaturalness
of this. And so he causes Mrs. Wilmore, when
the debacle comes, to level an accusing forefinger
at her husband and say significantly “I know you.”
Wilmore immediately breaks up. It is good
stagecraft and better psychology. Nothing but
the consciousness that his wife—that never-
failing, ever-sycophantic audience of one—had
seen through his posturings would have removed
him from his pedestal of righteousness. It is said
that English bishops have fled the country for
ever on learning that their wives knew all". If
it is allowable to carp at a fine play, it may be
suggested that the slimy despicableness of the
Vicar of Weybury is overdone, and that the
change of heart that comes over Mrs. Wilmore in
the last act is (however edifying) startlingly
unlikely and unexpected. Would a woman of her
type, who had fought as she had, yield thus
swiftly to the representations of the interfering
underling who had caused the ruin of all her
hopes? Surely not. There is an interesting
analogy to the student of H. A. Jones’ dramatic
methods between this belated relapse info virtue
of Mrs. Wilmore and the equally tardy apd
unlooked-for relapse into sentimentality of Mrs,
Quesnel and Sir Richard Kato in the last act of
Rebellious Susan ’; and both are palpably sops
thrown to the sentimentalists.
* * - .
The plot of ‘ ‘ The Hypocrites ” is simplicity
itself. Leonard Wilmore has met Rachel Neve on
his travels abroad. The customary “ mishap ” has
occurred. Rachel arrives in a worried frame of
mind at the Wilmores’ home and tinds that pre-
parations are in train for the marriage of her
lover to a local heiress. It is desirable that
Leonard shall wed the heiress, since the family
estate is heavily mortgaged. Rachel is induced
by Mrs. Wilmore to sacrifice herself “for Leon-
ard s sake.’ She foregoes all claim on the man
who has ruined her. But the Curate of Weybury
learns the position of affairs. He is a rar - charac-
ter, who is prepared to do the right thing though
the roof fall on his job as a result. With a high-
minded doggedness that in an Archbishop would
be annoying to the respectable parties concerned,
and that in an obscure hedge-cleric is unspeakably
maddening, he persists in exposing what is going
on. In a tense scene he finds himself publicly
denied both by Leonard and by the girl whom he is
trying to save. He is moving brokenly away.
Suddenly Leonard clasps Rachel in his arms
and kisses her passionately. Nature or love
or pity or all three have asserted themselves.
The edifice of lies that the Wilmores have raised
is shattered. The curtain falls on a justifiably
exultant curate, and a depressed band of hypo-
crites.
The role of Edgar Linnell is full of oppor-
tunities for Harcourt Beatty, and he makes good
use of them. In fact, it may be said that in
spots he makes too good use of them. It is doubt-
ful if any parson who had not served an early
apprenticeship on the boards would wheel, gesticu-
late, and stride down stage with quite the
dramatic hopelessness of the Criterion Linnell
when he tinds all the world against him. Miss
Gladys Harvey provides a convincing, because
rigidly restrained, picture of Rachel Neve—a
character that one touch of overplay would make
banal. James Lindsay makes Wilmore a thought
too truculent in the first act; but afterwards his
study of that most human personage is a thing of
perfect joy. Frank Randell wrestles successfully
with the difficult part of Leonard. Nellie Mor-
tyne does excellently as Mrs. Blayney, and Gas-
ton Mervale plays Viveash with much quiet dis-
tinction.

On Saturday “ An Englishman’s Home ”
will be on view at Sydney Royal. Eardley Turner
is to play the role of Brown, the owner of the
Home, and other members of the family and
callers at the Home will be represented by H.
Kolker, Tith. junior, Miss Ola Humphrey, etc.
The play is said to be a “rouser,” imperially
speaking, and considerable, not to say frantic,
patriotic enthusiasm is expected from the audi-
ence. In fact, if the stalls and dress-circle rise
en masse at the end of the last act, and whole-
heartedly insist on borrowing £60,000,000 from
England and therewith purchasing the harassed
old Motherland a brand-new army, the Royal
management will remain stolidly unamazed.

‘ ‘ And again I say unto you, all melo-
dramas are the same melodrama, and whosoever
putteth on a dress garment and seeketh origin-
ality in such things, lo ! he shall be confounded,
and rage shall consume him ! ’’ The Bulletin’s
religious editor is moved to misquote the Scrip-
tures as above after witnessing “Queen of the
Night,” produced by Allan Hamilton’s co., at
Sydney Palace. To all intents and purposes, the
piot is the same old skeleton that has supported
every melo. of the last 20 —or 100—years. Which
fact would seem to indicate that the intelligent
manufacturer deliberately avoids being original;
for it is hardly conceivable that, among several
hundred of them, one would not occasionally arise
with a fresh idea. If one ever did, one of several
things must have happened to him :
(a) He thought better of it.
(b) His drama was received with contumely.
(c) The tribe killed him before he could give his work
to the world.
In “Queen of the Night ” the characters are the
same old plainly-marked goods ; also, the plot is
the same old heap of bones. Ralph Featherstone
(who is good and noble) thinks he is lawfully
married to Paulina, who is beautiful and heart-
less, and has a lawful husband (Ralph Stone-
leigh). The latter has allowed her to
victimise Featherstone in unholy matrimony in
order that they may accumulate sufficient to fly to
a foreign country and live comfortably together
without having to work—a commonplace enough
ideal for two such fiery natures. Featherstone
and Paulina have a child, which dies during the
first act whilst Paulina is entertaining a number
of second-hand guests at a fancy dress fgte.
Maud Sylvester—who is Featlierstone’s ward, and
is in love with her guileless guardian—tends the
child with a mother’s cary until it dies, and then
breaks the news of its demise to Featherstone
whilst 'the champagne-soaked company stands
round and jeers. The Queen of the Night laughs
at the dreadful tidings, and the home starts to
disintegrate immediately. After the storm,
Maud soliloquises a piece about her love for
Featherstone whilst he is standing just be-
hind her; the subsequent dialogue leaves no
doubt in the spectator’s mind that matrimony
will be the end of them. In a subsequent
street scene they' part mournfully, Featherstone
promising to come back when a number of his
enemies are dead. Featherstone then repairs to
the railway station to catch the 8.45 for London.
The next scene shows one railway carriage stand-
ing still while the orchestra gets fearfully excited
to illustrate the fearful rate at which the rolling
stock isn’t travelling. In one compartment,
Ralph Stoneleigh is endeavoring to kill Feather-
stone ; and, from the next, the drunk funny-man
(who has overheard the murder plot) and his sober
deputy are clambering along the footboard to the
rescue. The scene ends by the villain being cast
out on his ear, leaving his intended victim quite
undamaged.

After all, Australia’s best defence must be
the increase of its population and its wealth.
And viewed through that lens of wisdom, D.C.L.
Whisky, the Fisher policy seems aimed in a pro-
gressive direction. Wise utilisation of the land
and the D.C.L. brand of wisdom must soon raise
Australia above the fear of any foe,*
Ten years amble past. Act 111. intro-
duces a miserly old man, who only seems to have
been created in order that Stoneleigh may murder
him, and that Jack Trent—the conventional
sailor stage-lover, who is in love with the
miser’s daughter and marries her —may be
falsely accused of the murder. However,
Trent is, later, tried, and honorably acquitted
by the local policeman. Scene 2 of this act
shows the gallant Featherstone saving the awful
Paulina from the raging deep. He doesn’t
recognise his fiendish wife until they are
within a few feet of the shore; when he
does, he puts one arm round a rock, and sup-
ports the exhausted woman with the other ; and
there, in the stormy water, they engage in a long
argument. (Imagine the astonishment of the
people who shudder at Watson’s Bay, Sydney, if
they saw a matrimonial wrangle proceeding in
the surging depths of the Gap, and, on the rocks,
a mob of spurious rescuers, who, instead of drag-
ging the twain ashore and hustling them away to
get dried, were listening shamelessly to the sordid
row!) Featherstone, at the end of the quarrel,
pushes Paulina back into the sea; but she manages
to float ashore, and in the next scene tries to
murder Maud Sylvester, who has married Feather-
stone under the impression that she (Paulina) is
dead. Of course the attempt fails. The play
then shambles to a conclusion. Paulina is mur-
dered at the last curtain to clear the aisle for
Featherstone and Maud—the policeman and the
deputy funny man considerately loosing their grip
of the arrested Stoneleigh for a moment in order
that he may do the deed. The ramshackle play
is brightly presented, and the scenic artist has
done his duty by it. Ada Guildford (Paulina)
and Rosemary Rees (Maud Sylvester) are ex-
cellent within the limits of their artificial rdles.
May Hesford, as a sweet-voiced, kindly matron,
chaperones the drama gracefully; and Maud
Chetwynd sparkles cheerfully as a maid. Of the
men, G. P. Carey and John Hesford have the
most human parts. Carey is Old Briskett, a
meekly humorous drunkard, and Hesford portrays
David Pentreath, a miser. George Cross, as
Ralph Featherstone, has to be extremely good,
and Wilton Power, as Philip Stoneleigh, has to
be preposterously wicked. Sufficient to say they
do their duty like actors, if not like plain human
beings.
Wirth Bros.’circus is in Sydney again,
and this time is located in George-street West, at
the rear of the church of St. Barnabas. As
usual, it is an imposing show, from which the
dazed citizen staggers home about midnight with
a feeling of fearful fulness. For Wirths’ outfit is
not mere circus. It is a combination on a large scale
of vaudeville show, circus, menagerie, hippo-
drome, gymnasium, and sixteen other things.
Each event crowds so fast on the heels of
the one before, that at the end the effect
is that of a cinematograph display driven at
top speed, and it is impossible to sort out the
performing tiger from the lady who rides a bicycle
in mid air, suspended from the teeth of the man
who dangles by his feet. Wirths have mastered
the secret of making the most of what is already
a gigantic show, by rolling it on in great masses.
The new cycle wizards, who, as the advertise-
ments state, start where the old loopers of
the loop left, off, are worth going far to see.
But the most impressive picture is never shown in
the tented field. It is usually a night scene when
the cages swing out from the side of the special
steamer, and through the silent streets winds a
long procession of brightly-painted cages, pushed
by elephants marshalled by men in gay colored
shirts. It smacks of the alleged gorgeousness of
Asia, and reminds of Edgar A. Poe’s “Tale of
the Ragged Mountains.”

Sydney Tivoli is waiting anxiously for
Chung Ling Soo, the silent Chinese juggler who
is due to produce the lady from the meat safe on
Saturday evening, some time after the remark-
able first part has raged aimlessly. Meanwhile, a
red lady has come to dwell for a moon
or so in the lodge of the Great Chief ’Arry-
rick. Her specialty is understood to be bows
and arrows; but as she arrives on Tues-
day night and this issue is racing Easter
through the presses, her turn is held over for con-
sideration next week. The rest of the entertain-
ment is supplied by Ryugoro Shima and Kiyo
Kameda (the jiu-jitsu pair), Tom Woottwell, the
Two Bells, Baby Watson, Cull Pitt, G. W. Hun-
ter, and Miss Desiree. The last two depart

Adelaide has always had a soft corner in
its heart for “The Belle of New York.” It was
a success there from the first (as it was not in some
other cities). And Adelaide has various things to
remember it by. Oscar Girard lies buried in West
Terrace cemetery; and it was in this piece in the
Adelaide Royal that Albert Whelan, the Aus-
tralian, had his first big chance, taking Girard’s
place on the opening night, and getting splendid
notices from a press that naturally thought he
was the American star. A strong \Y"i] 1 ianison co
has given a sudden five nights of the old piece on
its way West; Nable, Sherras, Loder, and Fred
Leslie, Olive Godwin, Evelyn Scott (playing
cleverly in a part rather outside her usual
range), and many other good people, made
a big cast. Those who know the thing by
heart noticed that Russell Sage—who is now
very dead is still named as the millionaire who
wouldn t like to pay the Queen of Comic Opera’s
salary. Recent cos. have reasonably substituted
Hetty Green as the wealthy but careful
person. And why is the captivating song of the
twins, Come with me to Portugal,” always
omitted nowadays? Elsewhere in Adelaide "a
Captain Seaton has been lecturing and swinging
clubs. He walked down from the hills into Ade-
laide scantily but picturesquely clothed, and
announced that he was tramping round the world
for the usual £4OOO, and reckons to get it if he is
not killed in Tibet. (The idea of avoiding Tibet
has not yet occurred to him.) Three of his pre-
decessors have been killed, and he himself was
assailed by 35 men in buckram in America, but
he appears to have surrounded and captured them.
The Captain talks as well as he walks.
“ The Girl of the Golden West ” is serving
drinks at Her Majesty’s (Melb.) to the satisfac-
tion of a numerous public. Given a stronger
ending to her maiden love story, the Girl would
probably continue to ‘‘reach out” and pass the
bottle for a lengthy period.. The first two acts of
Belasco’s drama are so strong in their theatrical
way that the weakness of the third act and a fleet-
ing scene that follows it is the more pronounced.
Better for the young woman to die of suffusion of
blood on the soul after taking down the sheriff
with her three aces and a pair. Then the wounded
Kingston might totter from his recumbent posi-
tion at the table and expire also, like Romeo with
Juliet. And their attitudes in death might
express a joint determination to reach out for the
infinite beyond. As it is, the audiences who
get stirred to their inner depths when
the Girl snatches a full hand from the privacy
of her lower left limb are apt to forget
their bygone rapture ere the final curtain falls.
The performance of “The Girl of the Golden
West” shows points of improvement since the
first night in Melbourne. The gloomy Sheriff
speaks his lines more distinctly, or perhaps it is
that the ear grows accustomed to his weird diction.
But he should moderate his Svengalian chuckle,
anyhow. The Girl talks of shooting: him when
he chuckles, and the present writer feels that
way. Kingston is more persuasive than he was,
and Miss Tittell Brune strikes a beautifully true
note in her exclamation of “Oh H—1!” It is
the cry of an unconventional bar lady, whose
heart is suffused with strange joy.

Melb. Princess’s, which has been closed for

Saturday (10th). Nellie Stewart and her new co.

tioned, and Nellie at the present moment is Mel-
bourne’sleadingobjectof interest. Her preliminary
appearances in the auditoriums of other theatres
have been enormously successful, and the box-
plan for her re-debut at the Princess’s was marked
off with incredible rapidity. The city hungers
for Nellie. She will start to supply the want in a
richly caparisoned comedy-drama from America,
the title whereof is “ Sweet Kitty Bellairs.”

At Melbourne King’s, “ The French Spy ”
persists in her regeneration with the aid of the
dressmaker and a dab of rouge, what time the
stupendous form of Waltah Baker lingers in the
offing. Waitah’s vicinity, of course, is explained
by the fact that he is the lady’s lovah and
coadjutor. Count Laurence Dunbar and his team
of gliding assassins have successfully turned the
play into a sort of cosmopolitan morgue. Speak-
ing further of the Count, it may be observed that
he is successfully married in this production. In
previous outrages his attitude towards lawful
matrimony has been almost invariably negative.

Included in West’s programme at Mel-
bourne Olympia is an outburst entitled “Britain’s
Defenders on Land and Sea,” which is capable of
stirring up the inherent Dreadnoughtism* of the
season to a flood of molten ooze. Also, there are
interesting flutters upon “Building an Aero-
plane,” “The Herring Harvest,” and the
“Frankfort Zoo,” with the usual comic
or chronic phantasies stuffed in between
the solid bricks of the bill of fare. At the
Taitocratic show place, the Glaciarium, the pro-
gramme finds room for another large full course of
Sherlock Holmes. In addition to the endless
Holmes, one is shown Ed. Rex and Mrs. Rex
opening the British Parliament, which ceremony
is a colossus ; besides pictures- of a “Tragedy in
the Snow” and of “Bear-hunting in America.”
Yet another feature is “ The Manners and
Customs of the -Caucasians,” which should be
followed slowly. In any hurried search for their
customs one can quite easily overlook their
manners. As for the menu at the Bijou Theatre,
it comprises sundry weepfulnesses such as “A
Friend in Need ” and “For His Sister’s Sake,”
besides the very usual terrific unnerving humorists
of the fall-down (or down-fall) order.

An audience of higher average intelligence
than is usually drawn to a theatrical entertain-
ment rolled up to the Oddfellows’ Hall (Melb.)
t’other night to’ see friend William Moore put
himself and his four playlets on the little stage.
Moore, of the local Evening ’Erald, is an essen-
tially likeable fellow’, who builds castles in
Bohemia, views dilettantism through a magni-
fying glass, and smokes a cigarette soulfully. His
sketchy essays as an author-actor proved to be
simply characteristic of the amiable performer.
The work was amateurish and trivial, and strictly
imitative in manner, but it appealed somewhat to
the artistic sympathies of his audience. The pro-
gramme comprised a comedietta, in w'hich Willie
Moore took himself seriously as a portrait painter
and lady-killer of exceptional attainments, followed
by a sketch, crudely drawn on the old familiar
“Rickards’’lines, in which thesameidentical Moore
professed to be a stage-manager coaching two
amateurs in the art of acting, and a monologue
wherein Moore repeated himself under the head-
ing of a newspaper reporter. Also there was a
dualogue between an Australian girl and an
English johnnie, which suggested an irrelevant
comedy-relief episode in a lamentable melodrama.
Played by professionals, these trifles would have
appeared less flabby and more distinctly faulty,
no doubt. They were not convincing proofs that
the producer would be unable to produce some-
thing very much better if he gave his imagination
a chance ; but the fact that the echoes of old ideas
reverberated through the hollowness of Moore’s
playlets tended to confirm one’s suspicion that he
will not eclipse the immortality of the other
William—likewise an actor as well as a dramatist.

J. and N. Tait have determined to tickle
the jaded sensation-sense of the Australian public
with some fresh excitement before long. Con-
cluding that aeromania needs a fillip on this
fa§ade of the spinning marble, they have arranged
for the appearance of one of Wilbur Wright’s
aeroplanes in Australia in about a couple of
months’ time. The animal will be accompanied
by more or less of a herd of experts ; so that,
besides being dazed by the spectacle of the curious
thing skimming through the breath of the world,
the observer will be able to add quite a number of

The musical Cherniavski youths, whose
ages are now definitely stated in the advt. as 17,
15 and 13 respectively, are returning in their vel-
vet knickers to Melbourne Town Hall .on Satur-
day next (10th). Their first concert will be a
matinee, but on Thursday and Saturday of the
following week they will be allowed to sit up late.
That is to say their concerts will be evening
events.

Chung Ling Soo leaves •Melbourne Opera
House after Thursday of this week with a view to
transferring his tons of tricks to Sydney. In the
meantime, Dale and O’Malley, vocalists and
comedians who talk a lot and answer one another
back, are helping to fill the gap ere it is made.
The gap will be large, so the new arrivals are
likely to be supplemented in a day or two.
Wirths’ circus and menagerie were enveloped in an
atmosphere ol the Immortal William t’other week. The
canvas and the camel pulled in at Stratford (Maoriland)—
a great cow centre. The train was unloaded alongside
Juliet-street, and the long string of beasts, etc., passed
along Miranda and Portia streets, and eventually pulled
up in Hamlet-street. The town also possesses Romeo,
Antonio, Cordelia, and other Shakspearian streets. Strat-
ford is on the Patea River or Trickle, and its name is a
discordant element amid the general Shakspearianness
of things.
Premier Wade, of N.S.W., made a beauti-
ful bloomer in criticising the Fisher naval policy.
This policy includes the building of four ocean
destroyers and 19 destroyers of the “River”
class, and Wade fell in thus :
We are promised a tinpot fleet of 19 more destroyers
and four ocean destroyers. The 19 would only practically
operate inside harbors and in smooth waters. What
earthly use were these boats ?
Wade was apparently under the impression that
it was proposed to arm the Sydney ferrys
steamers, and run them as torpedo boats. He
didn’t know that the River class of destroyer is
essentially an ocean-going boat, and is deliberately
designed to operate in rough seas. It is called
“ River ” merely because each one of the British
vessels of this type is named after a river—not
because the vessels operate in rivers. But Wade
didn’t know.
Three well-worn Australian money-spinners
died within an hour or two of one another in the
flickering moments of last week. T. R. Allt, who
had run Allt’s brewery in Sydney for close upon
quarter of a century, and then reckoned that there
was more money in other things, was found un-
conscious in the Sydney office of the North Coast
Shipping C 0.,, of which he was managing director.
He and John See had pushed that concern up
till it was the most prosperous of purely coastal
shipping cos. ; and both these apparently hardy
pushers are now dead. A more ancient veteran
was William McCulloch, of Victoria, who 40-odd
years ago founded the McCulloch Carrying Co.
Later on, he passed that business on to Wright,
Heaton and Co., and gave himself up to politics,
in which he was a dreary old failure. The third
money-spinner to go out, before he had time to
see whether the noisy Australian tuft-hunter was
good enough for even £lOO,OOO of his own money
to buy a Dreadnought with, was Frederick Lay-
cock, who, for 50 years or thereabouts, had been
buying the sheep’s overcoat and exporting it in
large quantities from Melbourne and Brisbane to
Bradford. He was generally credited with being
the oldest wool-buyer in Australia. They were
all three estimable old gentlemen in their way,
but Dreadnought excitement evidently didn’t
agree with them, and in at least two of the cases
death followed a swift paralytic stroke.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Pasquale Torzillo, Sydney’s best-known harpist, died
last Thursday. For over 45 years he had been tweaking
the strings of his ancient instrument, and between times
bringing up a family of three sons and three daughters to
make other pleasant noises. Mrs. Torzillo, who pre-
deceased her husband several years, was a sister of Louis
Becke, the Australian author.
Mrs. Melba is indignant with the Argus. The other
Saturday it published a series of pictures of past and
present stage favorites, with their selling price tabbed on
them in large figures. Melba’s price wasgiven at £l4 per
singing minute. Now her manager writes declaring that
Nellie holds the world’s record, which she put up at
Sydney, when she netted a clear £2360 out of half-an-
hour’s singing, equal to £7B 13s. 4d. per minute.
“ Star ” : A real actor’s drama is Belasco’s “ Girl of the
Golden West,” full of little tricks and turns that are
deliberately designed to make points rather than to give
an artistic presentation of life, men and manners. This
is a common defect of the American play. It is often
catchy and smart, but never fine and convincing in the
sense that a good German or French play is. The Ameri-
can playwrights are all slavish disciples of Scribe, the
prophet of the well made play. They build dramas for
the sake of effective bits, scenes and situations, and
nothing great can possibly come of such an attitude to-
wards the art. What I remember of this “Girl of the
Golden West’’after three days is the girl sitting on a
table, soliloquising : “ He says I have the face of an angel.
Oh, Hell ! ” and a sheriff holding out his hand to say good-
bye to the heroine, and catching in it a drop of blood
from the wounded road-agent (bushranger) hidden aloft.
“J.H.”: Went to the Queen’s Hall (Sydney) for the
purpose of being shocked by the Salome dance, and was
horribly disappointed. It was a depressingly respectable
show, such as might have been conceived by George
Ardill and staged by Judkins in his less ribald moments.
The lady lacks one of the first essentials of a Salome,
in that she isn’t a bit wicked-looking. Her legs are
shapely, but almost evangelical, and though there are
no complaints regarding the rest of her form, there is
less revealed than you can see at any of the surf-beaches
on any pleasant Sabbath. Perhaps surf-bathing makes man
grow callous and raises corns on his finer feelings, bull
left the Queen’s Hall without feeling half the devil of a
fellow I do when I read the Pink ’Un on the ferry-boat.
As I passed the box-office, a man in a brown slouch hat
and a red comforter was demanding his money back. As
the chucker-out bounced him on the pavement, I identi-
fied him as the pastor of our local Methodist Church. He
was also disappointed, and I don’t wonder at it.
Bill Anderson, of the King’s Theatre, Melbourne, has
been the doubtless grateful recipient of a Supreme Court
writ from Mrs. Marion Clarke, executrix of the will of the
late Marcus ditto. The lady is said to be claiming
damages for alleged infringement of copyright in coir*
nection with Bilham’s recent production of “ For the
Term of His Natural Life.”
“ Star ” : At a moving picture show in Melbourne they
ate displaying a faked set entitled “ Christian and
Pagan,” inspired by the spirit of the l,ate\Wilson Barrett,
mixer of “ The Sign of the Cross." The bed-spread drama
differs from “ The Sign ” in the fact that the hero is the
godly party with the rope round his garments, and the
heroine is the frivolous and hkppy Pagan draped in
pearls.' It is noteworthy that all the Pagans are merry
and youthful and beautiful, and spend their time
dancing in rose garlands, and dlinking sparkling wine.
Their surroundings are clean and artistic, and their lives
are made up of love, laughter and music. Thel Christians,
on the other hand, are gloomy prowlers who carry huge
crosses like clubs. They are gaunt and unhealthy, and
have hollow eyes and violent pains in the middle;, The
hero, who is the most dismal of this bunch of hospital
patients, eventually converts the Pagan lady, and
she burns down her beautiful home, an apt of
wanton incendiarism that is naturally resented by
the uninsured neighbors. Then the holy mail
takes his proselyte to live in a wretched, insanitary
cavern in a desert, right alongside a defunct
camel—which animal is made painfully obvious. Natu-
rally the lady dies of too much piety and too bad drains,
accelerated by defunct camel, and the hero hurls himself
in the mud, and has an unusually violent agony in his
dark interior as the scene fizzles out. As a manifestation
of the theory that cleanliness is next to godliness, this
film is commended to the Y.M.C.A., the W.C.T.U., and
the heads of churches generally.
TO A DIVA: A STAVE OF GOOD CHEER.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
MELBOURNE, Monday.
Mrs. Melba, accompanied by the Countess of Dudley,
visited Lilydale to-night. Much enthusiasm was mani-
fested, the streets being illuminated. While singing
“Honie, Sweet Home” Mrs. Melba was overpowered with
emotion, and broke down.— News Item.
Mr. John Lemmone, writing to the Melbourne Argos,
says:—“ln an article in the Argus, taken from the
Strand Magazine, a serious misstatement is made with
regard to Mrs. Melba’s fees—an error which, however
trifling in one light, is in another sense a grave misrepre-
sentation of facts. .... In New York Mrs. Melba receives
3000 dollars, i.e., 600 guineas, a night, which is 1000 dol-
lars per night in excess of that given to the next highest
paid singer on the combined lists of the two houses. She
can draw more money in any city than any living singer,”
etc., etc.
Ah ! Dry those tears, dear lady ;
Things really aren’t so bad.
Bear up. Smile, I implore you ;
Try to look bright and glad.
Review your situation ;
Is it so cheerless, bleak ?
You make—so says Lemmone—
Some thousand pounds a week
(The writer tries like blazes
To snare a crust. Yet at
The week-end oft encounters
A bailiff on his mat).
You may sing, night and morning,
What songs, and where, you list;
No one gets bored or angry,
Or asks you to desist.
The writer owns a tenor
And yearns to make it heard.
His world conspires against him.
It passes him “ the bird.”
Suppose you brought your music
To an “ at home,” and trilled,
And straight were urged to “ chuck it,”
At risk of being killed,
Then you would have a grievance.
(The writer owns, with pain,
This shame has overwhelmed him
Again and yet again.)
He recently, as you did,
Revisited the place
Where he was born. The natives
Did not go wild and race
To hand him floral tributes.
No glad bonfires were lit.
None met him but a tradesman,
Who handed him a writ
For goods supplied long years back.
His agony was deep ;
The goods were dust, and he was broke—
And yet he did not weep.
Cheer up ! Although the whole world
May seem like one vast hearse,
Sometimes; know that with others
Things are a dashed side worse.

THE THERMOS FLASK
AND ITS POSSIBILITIES.
You may not be acquainted with its many uses.
It causes liquids placed in it to retain their temperature, be it
hot or cold, for 24 hours. This makes the Thermos Flask in-
valuable in the nursery, in the sick room, to the traveller and
sportsman.
When driving in the country you may, with the Thermos,
always have your hot or cold drink made before starting.
When picnicking you can make your tea in the comfort of your
home, and save the trouble of boiling water.
For yachting, motoring, cycling, and all modes of travel the
Thermos is equally useful.
We stock these as follows: —
Leather covered, to hold one pint - - 22/6
Leather covered, to hold one quart = = 37/6
Call in and see these Thermos Flasks while in Sydney they are
an example of our modernness and moderateness in price.
We pay the carriage on these throughout the Commonwealth.

SOCIETY
The recent finding of a human head on the
shore at Newcastle (N.S.W.) recalls an incident
which happened at the same place in the ’7o’s.
It wasn’t a head then, but a leg, and the leg was
picked up inside the breakwater. The coroner
was a punctilious old gentleman, who, when he
wasn’t “sitting on the body,” acted asshipping-
manager for one of the minor collieries. He was
paid a guinea for each inquest, and ho ravened
after the guinea. So he had a jury summoned,
and held an inquest; and the verdict was that
the leg had been “found drowned."’ And all the
time a one-legged shellback lay recuperating in
Newcastle Hospital. His other leg had been
amputated and mislaid.
ADAM AND EVE.—(AN ALLEGORY.)
A big Japanese store in Bourke-street
(Melb.) throws a curious sidelight on Jap customs
by exhibiting a bundle of “back-scratchers” in
its windows. The scratcher is a slender cane
about a foot long, surmounted by a little claw
hand. Presumably it is used by the Jap gentle-
man for scratching those portions of his anatomy
which he can’t conveniently get at. But why
reveal to a brutal world such details in the life of
our noble ally ?
Justice Pring, of N. S. Wales, didn t quite
burst the marriage-tie the other day, but he gave
the engagement ring a shocking strain. He was
discussing breach of promise, and was telling a
jury that nothing of the kind is known to the
Law. Adolphus, it seems, might promise to
marry Angelina; but if Angelina turned up her
nose at Adolphus, and scornfully bade him go and
get work, she couldn’t subsequently get the help
of the Courts in lightening the pockets ot
Adolphus. But if Angelina closed with the otter
of Adolphus, then, provided she could get some
corroboration of the contract, she might come at
Adolphus. What Justice Pring, however,
wanted to stress was that no conceivable amount
of philandering could be construed into a contract;
Adolphus might hang upon the lips of Angelina
every night of the week, and still it wouldn t be
evidence of a contract. Even —and at this point
things began to get revolutionary—the presenta-
tion of a ring with live diamonds in it wasn t to be
construed into a contract. In fact, in the case on
which Justice Pring was engaged, the ring—-no, a
ring—was given, as the gentleman admitted ; and
the gentleman cheerfully asked why lie shouldn t
decorate a lady’s finger as well as her
neck without being accused of having con-
tracted to forage for her all the days of
his life. The jury was evidently knocked out by
the inquiry, and found for the defendant; so all
the comfort the lady gets is a bill of Costs, There
is no telling what might happen if there were an
appeal; but meantime Angelina, who wants to
clinch the rather vague references of Adolphus, is
adjured to make occasional remarks in the presence
of Adolphus (and other people) as to the signifi-
cance of the ring she is wearing, and to the fancy-
work with whichshe is busy crowding every drawer
in the house. „
Why is the grammar of the militant
Dreadnoughter of so appalling a quality always ?
Here are some extracts from a recent issue ot tfie
Sydney Telegraph :
Sir,—The voices in the air are showing: The futility
ot threatening England, that rings the world with her
sons ; that Australian blood and money is ready to help
repel any tampering with England's freedom ; that large
sections of Australians know that England’s prosperity is
due to the self-reliance engendered by her policy; that
Australians are squirming Under the clay heels that ron
them of five shillings in every one of their hard-earned
pounds ; that an Australian ballot taken to-day would
capsize Protection for ever.—Yours, etc.,
March 25. IYKE.
Again : ,
This is no imaginary conversation, and bears out tne
belief long held by the writer, that Germany aims at
eventually ruling over Australia, and this result is being
aided by the action of the Ministry set over us, m with-
drawing our continent from under the aegis of the British
Fleet in a short time. —Yours, etc.,
ANOTHER IMPERIALIST.
March 29.
And finally:— _ ...... ,
In conclusion, I beg to state that I consider the idea of
offering a man-of-war to the Imperial Government is one
of the grandest, one of the most patriotic, and one of the
most statesmanlike and masterly conceptions that has
seldom, if, indeed, has ever entered into the minds or
man. — Yours, etc., E. A. HUNGEHFORD.
March 29.
If E. A. Hungerford weighed in with a sentence
like that in an elementary State school composi-
tion examination, lie would be soundly and
deservedly smacked.
“ J.G.” : Who says that the late-lamented
Bumble was wrong when he described the law as
a braying animal ? The other day a young man,
well-known as a footballer about went
to Kerang (Vic.) and got married. A couple of
days afterwards he got as far as Bendigo on the
look out for work—so he said. Butins newly-
acquired wife, who was left behind, had a notion
that he was doing a bolt from her; so a warrant
was issued, and the husband was shot in by the
Bendigo Johns. After he was safely locked up,
one of the J’s.P. had occasion to look at the
warrant, and said it was no good as it wasn t
stamped, so the Johns had no option but to let
the accused out again. He had no sooner started
to breathe the free Bendigo air than he was seized
by another big »Tohn with another warrant, and
run in once more. The Court, after awhile,
passed out the new warrant for informality, so the
newly-married man was let loose some moie.
Next day he was run in for the third time,
but after awhile it was found that the third
warrant wouldn’t stand the acid test, And
there was a third liberation. After a few
hours’ freedom, one more big-booted con-
stable tapped the frequent prisoner on the
shoulder and told him to come along ; another
warrant had been issued. Again there was a hole
in the document, and this was the fourth libera-
tion. Next day, the same man was captured for
the fifth or sixth occasion, and, to make sure that
everything would be right this time the Court
waited an hour or two for the train to come in
from Kerang, sagging down beneath the burden
of more warrants. When it arrived, somebody
scooted off to the court with the blue paper, and
the case was called on, and the result was that
the warrant proved to be wrongly stamped or
something like that. The door was opened and
the accused again leaped out into Gods free
atmosphere. Then the police said they had
another warrant on quite a different charge, but
an authority said that this document was also out
of order. This time the Court declared it could
stand the racket no longer, and it sent the accused
to Kerang to let another Bench have a turn at
him. And probably he went there on an informal
train and with a disorderly ticket, and more
trouble will come of these things.
A [?]
EXCITED BARRACKER (to player who is skying the ball): "Keep it down; can't yer keep it down?"
GREASY DAN: "Gor'struth, Mister, I can keep any amount down."
“ Sr” : I hardly credited a remark of one
of your lady scribes to the effect that women
actually haul about with them in the public streets
heavy stuffed bears, in imitation of nippers carry-
ing dolls, till I saw a fluffy demoiselle staggering
alon 0 * Collins-street, Melbourne, with a furred
freak tucked under her She pressed the
hairy misery, and it squeaked, and she giggled
delightedly at the wonder. I heard this bear-
hauler speaking to a companion : “Deahleddy
did enjoy Melba last night, didn t you, dean .
Then the bear-dragger squeezed her cranky idol
again. If a girl of that sort was asked to carry
home a pound of sausages or a basketful of market
vegetables she would fall down dead with shock
or n sue you for maintenance and defamation of
character ; but she will haul a 3ft. 6in. Teddy bear
rio-ht through a day’s.walk and smile over the job.
And she has a votef. It is nO use to her. If sue
could get her vote stuffed and a tail fixed on it,
and carrv it under her arm, she would take a real
interest in it, but not otherwise.
MADNESS.
First Malade Imaginaire : “ It's very sad to
see these hearty young men. Now. fr’instance ,
there's Teddy Larkins. A raving hypochon .
driac, if ever there was one. Actually be.
LIEVES HIMSELF TO BE PERFECTLY WELL ! ”
“ Poleaxe ” : Rejoice, O Lion of England,
twirl yonr tail, and be exceeding glad. York-
street (Sydney) is with you. The girl employees
of a big (yes, a very big) firm, some of whom are
getting the 4s. under the Act, whilst others range
up much higher, even to 10s. (or 125.) a week,
were, last pay-Friday, confronted by a collecting-
box for a “Dreadnought for England And
when a collecting-box is held to you under the eye
of the omnipotent boss, it generally means a de-
duction from your wages. Therefore rejoice, O
Lion. The little four-bob-a-week girl is with you.
She can’t help herself.
Anglican Archdeacon Crossley preached
before Excellency Dudley and suite on the
Dreadnought epidemic at St. Kilda (’Vic.), the
other Sunday, and his text was, “He that hath
no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.”
From which the spiritual master argued that Aus-
tralia ought to give a large setting of Dread-
noughts to the Mn Country. Evidently sky-pilot
Crossley misread the text and imagined that it
ran, “He that hath no sword, let him sell his
garment and buy one and give it away, so that,
barring the loss of his garment, he will be just
where he was before.’ 5 fiat the Anglican Church
almost always goes with Fat, and no matter how
fatuous Fat may be, it will wrest the Scripture to
suit his fatuosity.
DUDLEY’S TIP.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Governor-General Dudley, prating in Melbourne the
other day, said he hoped Englishmen, Irishmen and Scots
would preserve their race distinctions here in Australia
and keep alive their traditions.
If you came from Wilts or Devon,
Or your pa was born in Surrey,
Though you’ve lived your life since seven
On the Barwon or the Murray,
Don’t forget the prejudices
Of that island, damp and chilly.
Though your recollection misses
Greater things, it would be silly
To lose sight of Orange Billy !
D j’ou hail from Ross or Peebles
And have settled in this hot land,
See no local love enfeebles
What you owe to far-off Scotland ;
Don’t permit your mere position
Ancient sentiments to banish ;
Stick to good old Scotch tradition,
Let no hoary hatred vanish,
And be verra keen and clannish 1
If ’twas Ireland you were born in,
Or your grand-dad came from Kerry,
Oh, wear ever Erin’s mournin’ —
Don’t forget the day of Derry !
Let no musty Old World error
Be put out of sight or slighted,
Keep alive the hate and terror,
And with creeds and wrongs unrighted
O, be ever disunited !

BEGA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This place seems to be a perfect paradise for j’oung
people. Everybody kisses everybody else—though I sup-
pose it’s innocent enough.— Mr. Justice Pring, in a bega
(N.S. IF.) breach of promise suit.
When a young man’s thoughts turn lightly
Towards etcetera in the spring,.
He should go where girls more tightly
Than in other places cling ;
As the fact is put politely
In the words of Justice Pring.
For fatigue, a
Trip to Bega
Is the thing.
For a joyous district this is,
Where idyllic days are spent
In a whirl of girl and kisses
And a wealth of merriment ;
And, though naught that comes amiss is
In their actions innocent,
We are eager
Down to Bega
To be sent.
Now the maids in vain are yearning,
Right from Lismore back to Louth,
For the love-lorn swains are turning
Towards each Bega lady’s mouth ;
And while fiercer fires are burning
There than in the home of drouth,
Need we speed an
Inch to Eden,
Further south?
So, if Mr. Hunter’s willing,
P’r’aps a tourist trip he’d run
To the spot where heaps of billing
And much cooing’s to be done ;
For we long to taste the thrilling
Joys of where the best of fun
Isn’t meagre ;
So at Bega—
Save us one.

Mr. James Murray, biologist with the
Slmckleton expedition, found some entirely hew
fleas on the fauna of the Antarctic. At least, td
thinks they are new, but so far he has not
thoroughly investigated and classified the speci-
mens at the Sydney G.P.0., and he may have
merely re-discovered an old flea.

A Mrs. Clarke told Acting-J ustice Rogers, of
N.S. W., about an unusual religion last week. Her
story was that her husband became inoculated with
it in Sydney Domain. Its head and front is a person
by the name of “The Old Man of theDomain,”and
with this person Mr. Clarke suddenly found him-
self “in unity” one Sabbath afternoon. Clarke
brought the oldster into the home, and indulged
in services there with him ; also he went to devo-
tional exercises held by the ancient in George-
street, and he took his wife with him, and urged
her to “put herself under the domain-dweller’s
reign seven times,” and so gain spiritual salva-
tion. As the Truth permeated deeper and
deeper into Clarke’s soul he took to -stay-
ing out all night. If he came home he
was generally fighting drunk. Finally he deserted
his wife, and settled down permanently in
another suburb, with nothing in the worid to
comfort him but drink, a strange woman, and his
new faith. His actions were dictated entirely by
his creed. In two respects the Domain faith is
liable to appeal to the wordling or unregenerate
wearied with the exigent dogmas and mohey-
grasping ways of better-known churches— viz., it
allows the widest laxity of moral misconduct and
there is no collection plate. All this, of course,
was Mrs. Clarke’s story, and it may be that she
was prejudiced against the new faith.

THREE EARTHQUAKES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A prominent European authority on earthquakes pre-
dicts a large upheaval in the neighborhood of Cook’s
Straits in 1911. Press item.
When the hefty earthquake finds us in the happy year
’eleven,
And the folk that lived in Wellington have winged their
way to Heaven,
Then the places that ain’t rocking round about our windy
shore
Will perhaps discover something that-they might have
learned before,
Just to build on steady ground,
On foundations good and sound,
And to keep their aspirations within bound, bound,
bound.
When the money market tightens as we thought it never
could,
And the cash must go to Cohen that the. people want for
food ;
When our staple products fail us and the seasons come
and go,
Each one worse than all the others, then, perhaps, we’ll
get to.know
That a heap of borrowed cash,
And a large financial splash,
Are the very certain heralds of a smash, smash, smash.
When the guns begin to thunder, and the skies are all
aflame,
And the seas are black with anger, and the hearths are
dumb with shame ;
When the blaek-and-tan are masters, and the white man
at the wall
Has begun to learn the flavor of the wormwood and the
gall—
When we’ve most of us been shot,
Then we’ll think, as like as not,
That military training isn’t rot, rot, rot!

A Woman’s Vote—Result
When our Australian women exercise the
franchise, it is a foregone coficlusion that
the women’s vote will be oh the side of
progress quality and not quantity of mem-
bers. We see it in everyday life—-there
are three women to-day using Sunlight
Soap for laundry and housework to one
using any other soap M the world. Why?
Because women quickly recognise quality,
and the progress effected by the Sunlight
way of washing described on the cardbox of
every tablet. Try Sunlight Soap next wash
day and you will vote therp is nothing better.
Archbishop Clarke, of Melbourne, lately
pointed out that the phraseology of the Anglican
prayer book is much behind the times, and very
misleading. For instance, worshippers are asked
to pray for the magistracy, “that they may in-
differently administer justice.” “Indifferently”
meant “impartially” when that was written.
Now the prayer amounts to a demand that the
inferior courts shall make a very bad hash of
justice, and they do. The petition is answered,
and the visible answer is the Victorian honor-
arium beak or J.P. Possibly that awful person
isn’t responsible for his own awfulness after all.
He may be shoved into folly by a Higher Power,
by way of an answer to public supplication.

One of the humorous features of the
Dreadnought shindy showed in Sydney the day
after the papers were encouraged to whip up the
cheap foolishness by publishing the first list of
contributors. The list appears to have been slung
together anyhow, and J. Brown’s name was liable
to transpire as T. Brown, and Jones blazed before
the world as Bones. Of course it didn’t matter a
straw, for J. Brown and Jones were both actuated
by the highest motives of patriotism—conscience
simply called on them to do something in deep
gratitude for the innumerable gifts bestowed by the
Motherland, etc., and not a man of them sought
such a base thing as advertisement. And yet no
Sooner had that list appeared than protests
started to pour in at the Town Hall; and the
next morning the list of corrections was longer
than the list of contributors. Not a man of them
wanted base advt., as mentioned before; all the
Same, Jones was mighty careful that some un-
known Bones shouldn’t takes his just and lawful
limelight from him.

“M.U.D.”: When the Blue Mountains
Zigzag expires, another ofMa State’s institutions
will have passed out. The query, “Have
you seen the Zigzag ? ” has become so deep-
seated a platitude that its death should
create a louder wail among chronic plati-
tudinarians than the destruction of the
marriage entanglement. But its more
straightforward successor bids fair to
equal the Zigzag in thrill and spectacular
effect. The 2$ miles in which the drama
in 11 tunnels is being enacted covers
scenery so wild that it almost roars.
Climbing among barbaric groups of
brazen cliffs, precipices and rock-strewn
gorges and gullies, you wonder if you
will ever escape to some country
where the architecture shows a trace
of sobriety. Huge indeed was the
optimism of the engineer who first
dreamt of dragging through these
amazing labyrinths of bloodthirsty
rocks a tail of luxurious carriages
laden with indolent sightseers. A
power-house is in course of con-
struction to light the tunnels with
electricity, which arrangement will
prov'e a godsend to the fettlers and
the casual bagman who takes the risk
of a short cut. Those eleven tunnels
will be something for the asthmatic
tourist to look forward to, unless the
Commissioners instal electric fans in
the carriages.

“Mate”: The recent numerousness of
shipping casualties brings out prominently the
need for more adequate life-saving appliances and
for stricter supervision. The boats of most ships
are arranged as Noah had them when he fixed
things up for his famous Asiatic voyage long ago,
and the average member of a ship’s crew is as
much at home in a boat as Billjim
from the hindquarters of Bourke.
The modern steamboat, running
after dividends, has no time to
train its crew in boat drill. The
most conscientious skipper or
mate has no opportunity to do
more than swing his boats out and
lower them to the water occa-
sionally. The real efficiency shows
up when it comes to unhooking
and getting away from the ship’s
side. That is where training is
needed. Handling boats at sea
and in anything like, say, the
Penguin wreck conditions, is im-
possible under present conditions.
Even allowing that the sailors
have some knowledge of small
craft, or at least an intelligent
understanding of orders, a modern
passenger ship can seldom muster
two mariners for each boat. Fire-
men and stewards, who make up
the balance of the crews, are
practically useless. One absolute
essential is that boats should be so
placed and fitted that they can be
easily put out from either side.
In almost all strandings there is
absolutely no chance of getting
boats out on the weather side as
things now are. Also every ship
should be made to carry a motor-
launch. A ship’s lifeboat is safe
enough once it gets away from the
ship, and it will keep afloat for
ever. But it is a most unhandy
craft with no grip on the water.
To float like a cork may be de-
sirable, but it doesn’t help a boat
to get along. The ordinary life-
boat will neither sail well nor pull
well, while life rafts are hopeless
in this connection. With a motor-
launch to help, the chance would
be immensely improved.

“ N.” writes :
One Blennerhasset, long resident in Berlin, furnishes
the London press with some remarkable inside views,
which come in handy at this time of German scare. He
shows how thick Queen Victoria was with the Empress
Augusta, and, of course, with the Prussian Crown Prince
and Princess of SO or 40 years ago. This quartette had an
amiable delusion that it could thwart Bismarck. In 1864
Lord John Russell, as Foreign Minister, with Palmerston
as Premier, fulminated a warning to Prussia against
aggression in Schleswig-Holstein. Robert Cecil, after-
wards Premier Salisbury, wrote boldly in the Quarterly
Review (see his republished Essays) that Prussia’s object
was to form a navy and flout Britain on the sea. Queen
Victoria pooh-poohed all this (for which see Granville’s
Memoirs). She quashed the attempt to restrain Prussia,
and Prussia dragged foolish Austria into its Danish row,
and then squashed Austria. Palmerston indulged in
jocularity when the flag of Germany first appeared on the
water. “ This Piratical Flag,” he called it in a letter to
the British ambassador at Berlin. It is alleged that the
Prussians won the battle of Sadowa through information
supplied by Queen Victoria.
Dear Bulletin, — Your statement last
week that “a baronet goes almost jet black when
frozen ” (this apropos the disaster which befell
Baronet Brocklehurst during the recent Antarctic
proceedings) suggests freezing as a test for dubious
baronets, of whom we have had many in these
parts. I presume that if the frozen aristocrat
turned the wrong color he wouldn’t be the right
man. —Yours, etc., Henry Horskcollar.
A REMNANT.
TOMMY (who has been promised an air-gun by
his father on his sixth birthday): “Mother,
I'm to have a second-hand gun because dad
says the spring will be easier; he gave me a
second-hand tricycle last birthday, and the
musical box at Christmas wasn’t new. I
wonder why he is so fond of these second-
hand things? I say, mother, were you second-
hand, too? ”
“Eight-inch Manila” goes off watch to
study art: —
Have been having- a gaze at Sydney artist Lister Lister’s
spread of canvas, “Rivals,” Said rivals are one of
Brown’s tugs (looks like the Champion) and a green Fen-
wick tug (the Hero, I suppose) ; and the rivals are tearing
over a tumbling sea towards a barque close-hauled in the
left-hand distance. The idea, of course, is that the first
one hailed gets the tow. I like the picture better than
most. I am no judge of art, but I know Brown’s tugs
well. So Ido Fenwick’s. Also I know the excitement of
chasing vessels for a job—a pastime the land-lubber
knows nothing of. Well, the Champion is all right, but
the other tug beats me. For on her foremast appears
something that never was on tug on sea or land. It looks
as if meant for a furled foresail, and a mighty badly furled
one at that. Now the Sydney tugs, when “ seeking” off
the Heads, don’t carry sails, and a lump of canvas
on the Hero’s mast, stowed in the fashion of a hired open-
boat in Middle Harbor on Easter Monday, wouldn’t give
her a chance against the Champion in the race for that
ship in the offing. But it may not be a sail on the mast.
Maybe it is an albatross in a fit of apoplexy. Or else it’s
the cook shinning- up the mast for some reason or other.
Would Mr. Lister Lister mind telling a poor sailor boy
what it is ?

The lane that Melbourne’s peripatetic
Flossies have trodden much of late—the one that
diverges from her main avenue of employment, so
to speak, and wanders through casual victims’
pockets—came to a sharp and sudden turning
when Justice Hood dealt with the two Collins-
street “ladies” who had relieved Parson Barrie
of £55. His Honor had made a laudable but
futile attempt to get into holts with the inevitable
“ bloke ” who had received the coin, but appar-
ently the police hadn’t thought it worth while to
keep an eye on him ; so, failing him, Mr. Hood
handed one Floss, with four previous convictions.
12 months’ hard ; while to the other, whose record
stood at 10 former experiences, he passed two
years, with an indeterminate term of detention to
follow. As the first woman who has come under
the Indeterminate Sentence law, this Flossie was
duly impressed, and, with blanched face, huskily
muttered, “ Thank you ; that is a nice birthday
gift!” Which, somehow, doesn’t augur well for
Flossie’s chances when she is presently put on her
good behavior. Still, a soft-spoken, experienced
young woman may persuade the I. S. Board to
release her speedily; or, again, she may not.
There is a parson on the Indeterminate Sentences
Board; and, up to now, this Flossie hasn’t had
much luck with parsons.

Leila the Leal, of whom W. M. Whitney
sang in verse and whom Norman Lindsay pictured
in a last month’s Bulletin, was a creature of
fancy ; but a very material counterpart of Leila
turned up a few days after the lady had worked
for her drunken sot in the pages of The Bulletin.
A woman in Melbourne had loved, honored and
obeyed from the year 1880 until last month,
when, like the ancient worm, she turned. In the
process she found herself in the Court of Partings,
which are not generally of sweet sadness. Her
tale, in the rough, was that her honored one had
done no work for 29 years. Seemingly he retired
after getting a wife. Forgetting himself, how-
ever, on one occasion, he secured work on the
Victorian railways, and kept it for three months.
He also kept the wages. His better half got a
whole shilling for household expenses out of the
three months’ earnings, since or before when she
has had no other. She kept the house by washing
and charing. Needless to say, the Judge unyoked
her, and she got rid of her mountain. There lies
a certain quaint humor in the fact that the head
of the house borrowed 9d. back out of the humble
shilling he donated her at the time of the Great
Work. He had all the makings of a Maoriland
Treasurer.
* * * *
Federation, which tends daily to Unifica-
tion and Reconstruction, leads, wherever possible,
to conformity in legal processes among the
States. Among the latest of these tendencies
is the effort to make the disorganised and
untidy death sentence work out the same
way in each State. At present, in some
cases a respite of 14 days is given between
sentence and execution ; in others two
Sundays intervene—which may be only
nine or ten days. In some States irons
are riveted on the prisoner’s legs after
sentence, and not taken off till the morning
of execution. In others (N.S.W., for in-
stance) irons are only put on if the prisoner
acts violently. There are places where
cords are used for binding the prisoners’
arms on the day of strangulation, and
other places where straps are employed.
Straps (an invention of the late Nosey
Bob, of N.S.W.) are certainly easier on
the prisoner, and hold him quite as
securely. The admission of the press
also shows differences of practice, as
does the disposal of the body after
execution. Hangmen urge uniformity
on these points; also in the matter
of remuneration. The job is prac-
tically the same in Brisbane, Sydney
and Melbourne, yet the pay greatly
differs, and so does the social stand-
ing of the official. He may bi a
civil servant on a salary, or he may
be simply a butcher paid by the job. The-ie
discrepancies are dispiriting to an honest hangman.

“ Sr.” : I found this advertisement in the
Melbourne Age :
/"dLERK, 27, with savings £650, salary £250 yearly,
desires acquaintance good-looking, stylish young
LADY, about 20, view above. Applicants must be of
good figure, affectionate and thoroughly genuine.
No others need answer.
BATCHEL, Age Office.
That guileless clerk, who doesn’t ask that the lady
shall have means but only wants the requisites
for a happy home, deserves better luck than he is
likely to get. For he quite disremembered to
mention that the lady must submit her figure to
careful examination by a committee of one lady
medico and one lady artist. Therefore, in return
for his salary and his savings, he will probably get
a padded fraud —a thing of whalebone and stuffing
and “developers” and the like —something with
high heels and an artificial bust. And when it is
too late he will we ip bitterly and say, “ How this
world is given to lying !”

“ Melba,” from the Victorian capital :
The Dreadnought folly is fizzling out in Victoria,
despite the booming of the press. The Labor party is
strongly opposing the scheme, and even the A.N.A.
branches are protesting against the side-tracking of Aus-
tralia’s defence policy. The Jingo crowd includes the
same old job lot of Stock Exchange boodlers, Foreign-
traders, sweaters, dead-beat parsons, and derelict
Tory politicians. The' old, cheerful method of
“dealing it out” to opponents which prevailed
during the Boer War is again in full swing. At
the Town Hall meeting three men were run out
by the scruff of the neck for saying “No, no,” when
they should have said “Hear, hear.” Half a dozen
“traitors” were similarly dealt with at the Prahran
meeting; u'hile at Bendigo a Jingo mine manager
endeavored to throw Labor member Glass off the plat-
form for daring to move a “ disloyal and un-British ”
amendment. The Age, with charming fairness, reports
any dissent at a meeting as “disorderly interruption,”
while the howling down of an opposition speaker is
warmly praised as “enthusiasm.” All the same, the
slump is visible to the naked eye.

“J.G.J. : Apropos “ Invicta’s ” par (B.
18/3/’O9) re Stepper Davis. Davis was at a country
race meeting in the Winton (Q.) district once.
The boys were lining up for the inevitable goat
race. “What price Stinker, Mr. Davis?” said
one of them. “ T-t ten to one to you, s-s-sonny,”
replied Stepper. The youngster closed with him
in shillings. Stinker won by the length of several
streets and an esplanade or two. As Stepper rue-
fully paid over 10s. he remarked, “T-t-there
w-was only t-t-two goats in t-t-that race—
S-s-stinker "and me.” It was this ability to meet
reverse with a jesting word and a bright face that
endeared Stepper to all who had the privilege of
his acquaintance.

“Oculeus”: A fine, healthy lie is
“Pisan’s” effort (B. 18/3/’O9) to the effect that
Papuan missionaries ring in glittering farthings
by way of payment for native labors I know
most of the devil-dodgers on the coast stations in
that part of the world, and could not be brought
with the weightiest of, meat axes to believe that
a single solitary one of them, from Marau to Yule
Island, would stoop to such a dodge. Anyhow,
since the Commonwealth took affairs Over, all
“labor” has to be signed-on before a Government
official, a bond entered into, and amount of
remuneration stated. Which fact alone suffices to
damn “ Pisan ” as a rank fiction-purveyor.

“ Mallarapoonie’s ” dingo :
While prospecting recently I camped on Upper Wills
Creek (N.-W. Queensland). Was awakened at dawn by a
peculiar rending noise close at hand. Lowered the
blankets gently and peered out. There, within Bft. of
where I lay, looming gaunt and ghostly against the first
faint paling of the dawn, stood a great he-dingo, with his
forepaws on one half of a Bulletin I had been perusing
by the namp fire over night, and leisurely tearing the
other half to fragments with his teeth. I leaned quietly
over and groped for the Winchester. The breach was
empty, but I silently engineered a cartridge home, and
then, with one arm and an eye out of the blankets, I
trained the firearm on his ear. It was just too dusky in
the dawnlight to see the front sight clearly, but I guessed
where it was, and pulled. Well, I missed him, but the
powder burnt his whiskers. He let out a terrific bowl, like
Oarruthers when the Ha State isn’t injured, sprang 4ft. into
the air, turned a political somersault ds la Joke ’Ook, and
landed back on the Wild Cat column on all fours. He
tried to figure out just where the meteor had come from.
Then for the first time he noticed my whiskered coun-
tenance appearing from amongthe foldsof the blanket, and
he glared at me with a green glare. However, the
clicking of the mechanism as I rammed another cartridge
home, suddenly recalled him to mind that he was a land-
agent, or had forgotten to see a wallaby about some
meat for breakfast. Anyhow, he fled, and for three
minutes after his departure, gravel and small ironstone
pebbles kept dropping into camp, in the same way as
Geo. Reid’s political sins came home to roost last election.
ON THE WHOLE.
"What was the row about, Tom?”
Oh, old Bob asked the face-reading bloke what
he thought of his face, and the bloke ses that,
though Bob’s mouth was a bit large and his
eyes too small, looking upon his face as a
hole, it wasn’t at all bad. And then Bob got
going.”
“Ginger ” writes a wildly-discursive letter
from the Western District of Victoria :
I see from “ Huffin-Guffin ” that the Glenelg River is
filling up with sand, and I notice the same thing.
Fifteen years ago I was walking across that river, and
nearly trod on a tiger snake. I threw a log of wood on
him, so I called round last week to have a look at the
place, but found it covered with sand. Balmoral is a
good business town, too. We have three churches, two
pubs, and one store. There is to be a sports meeting on
Easter Saturday. We had a race meeting seven years
ago, and one of the horses in the hurdle race
was disqualified, and another horse got the
money. The sporting chaps are very anxious
for Jeffries to wop the nigger, but I think if these two
ever meet big Jim will have to fight some and be quick
about it. We have a gold mine here, but so far we
haven’t got any gold. The town will go ahead when we
do. Duck were very scarce on the Black Swamp this
year. We are trying to get a railway through here, and
the people are preparing to go in for poultry farming.
Some think turkeys would do well.
A SLIGHT MISUNDER.
STANDING.
LADY : “ Yes, I'll give you some damper , but you'll have to use the axe."
SUNDOWNER: “ Oh, I don't mind it bein' a bit ’ard, mum. I can soak it in me tea."
“ Gip ” : The three dogs whose privilege it
is to be connected with this humpy can count.
Their owner rises and leaves the humpy at the
same time seven days a week. Six days he goes
to his work ; on the seventh he goes for his milk
and returns almost immediately. Six days a week
three bored-looking dogs emerge yawningly from
the woodheap and accompany him to his w'ork.
If, at break of day on the seventh, you peep out
quietly, you will see them licking each other with
much zest and conversing joyfully in gurgling
undertones ; and a few minutes later you will see
them start for the bush, biting playfully at each
other and smiling broadly. At midday they re-
turn. One is a stumpy-tailed aristocrat, and
treats his owner with affectionate indifference,
but the other two are lowly-bred, and invariably
drag home a rabbit each and lay it at the back
door by way of explanation. This is not an occa-
sional occurrence, but has happened every Sunday
for months without a break. On no other day do
the dogs desert their master.

Prom a vigorous pen in Papua :
Things are still in a bad way here, and there is a lot of
nitric acid in the atmosphere. There is occasionally a
taste of it in the courts. One great misfortune is that
native police and other nondescript native Papuans can be
intimidated into giving any evidence, pleasing or damn-
ing. Doesn’t matter against whom, and it is quite
immaterial to them what the concoction is. Likewise,
they take with equal equanimity a pound of tobacco or a
year in gaol. They are born gamblers. No one but a
noodle or an enthusiast in red braid would deny that the
Force is a lying, blackmailing, lazy lot. Probably 80 per
cent, of the police were fair, as natives go ; but, fre-
quently mismanaged by inexperienced and often incom-
petent mejQ, straight from behind typewriters, badgered
from pillar to post, disordered and misdrilled, they turn
out failures, even as natives ; they are banned by all mer-
chants ; they are scorned by (when not pimping for)
traders, miners, and native teachers ; and they are eyed
with suspicion wherever they go, be it among whites or
their own people. Reorganisation of the native con-
stabulary must come before the best of the Papuans will
believe that the Government represents the people, and
is not a separate society bent on harassing the residents,
instead of helping them.
Personally, I believe the time to be ripe for this corner
to be heard in the Australian House through a Terri-
torial Delegate, as the Philippines are heard in the U.S.A.
Congress. The fact of it is that those people with a
sound knowledge of Papua, its phases and its aims, have
little or no part in the history-making of the place ; and
for them to have to stand by and be walked over by
many pin-fingered officials, half a dog-watch in the land,
brings us near breaking poiflt. One can only compare
Papua internally with a nasty spitting little volcano,
emitting steam-laden personalities, and continually
rumbling in its bowels with rancor. Therefore, it is
sound talk when it is said that the application of a safety-
valve in the person of a sympathetic Delegate is impera-
tive. No one man could be expected to please every-
body, but by election he would represent the majority,
and any majority is a mighty big factor. If there is any
other way to avoid all this petty mud-slinging and
damphooi official incompetence and red tape, let’s have
it. But if you don’t know a way, let’s have this opiate.
“John Pasmore”: Apropos cockatoos in
their relation.to queer experiences. I was motor-
boating on the Murray, last winter, hetweqp
Manunka Bend and Forster, where the dead trees
are commonly white with this gentle fowl. Judge
my surprise as I passed a flock of them otie
morning to be informed by several ; hundred, loud
and aggressive voices that cocky wanted-a drink.
The statement was followed by a torrent of
irrelevant and awful cuss-words. Thexplanation
of this phenomenon is, I am given to understand,
that a civilised bird escaped from its doting old
spinster, with all the vices and wisdom of the city
at its claw- tips, and rejoined its former comrades.
And now the foolish and addled result is that 500
birds sit in trees and demand drink, while the
longest river in Australia rolls past their doors.

A PSALM OF VICTORY.
(A psalm of David upon an instrument of 10 strings.)
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Behold a troop cometb up from the sea, yea, mighty men
of valor are landing upon the seashore ;
Guns that turn upon wheels are at the place of landing;
even cannon that cast forth the thunderbolts of war.
There is sound of many horses prancing, of horses that
buck and of steeds that rear upon their hind props.
Behold, the bugle bloweth, hear ye the horn of battle.
There be ten thousand that feast and rejoice, yea, an
hundred thousand that eat rice with chop-sticks.
Their faces be yellow as tarnished brass, their
visages are fashioned after the similitude of the
monkey which hangeth down his tail from the top
branch.
They cry with a loud voice, they set up their tents upon
the seashore, they make a great tumult. The
banner over them is the banner of the Rising Sun.
Behold, they come to slay, to burn with fire, to divide the
spoil.
They are a mighty host. Who shall stand against them ?
Shall, words stay them? Shall they be salved with the
ointment of-speech ?
Behold they are angry, and their hands are trained to
shoot straight. Who shall oppose their might ?
Call with the voice of a trumpet: “ Come forth ye that
love Australia, come forth ye men of white skin and
high countenance. The day of your testing'is at
hand ! ”
Who answereth to the call ?
Lo, the legion of Stoush cometh, the men of many battles
draw nigh. Who shall stand against them ?
The}' come with the cut that is called the upper, with
the left that is straight, with the crouch that dis-
mayeth the belly of the warrior.
They come, they draw near, they vaunt themselves.
Who cometh after?
Behold, the legion of them that be mighty with the bat
that is of willow, and the ball that pitcheth to the
off and breaketh to the leg. Who shall stand against
them ?
These shall smite them to the square-leg, these shall cut
them to the boundary, these shall drive them with
might to the mid-on.
These shall cause their middle stump to fall to the earth,
and make them to be caught in the slips.
They shall see the ball, they shall smite upon it, and
behold it is not, yea, verily, and the umpire shall
give them out l.b. w.
They shall bowl all day and scatter nothing, they shall
pursue leather in the sunshine and the chase shall be
vain.
Who cometh after ?
Behold a troop cometh.
They ride upon the moke that is swift, yea, they are high-
seated on the racing prad.
Their flight is swifter than the eagle’s. Who shall stand
against them ?
Their limbs are the limbs of children, and their faces are
the faces of old men, and one who hath a banjo
singeth to them and rimeth like the Devil.
They leap the hurdle and the stone wall, they smite one
another in the straight place, they pull upon the reins
of the bridle and are not ashamed in the gate.
Wherefore Patrick Abraham rejoiceth and the devices of
the punter are brought low.
So shall it be with those of the yellow visage, and the
countenance that hath the seal of the monkey.
Who cometh after?
Lo, they that smite upon the ball with the hoof, they who
stay the swift in his flight and wrestle with the
strong in the miry way.
The voice of the barracker is loud—lo, he barracketh
exceedingly as these make haste to the war.
Behold when the scrum is set these shall overcome, and
jiu-jitsu shall be as the play of the ring-tailed
’possum in the gum trees of forgetfulness.
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war
become even as the tinned fish of yesterday !
Who cometh after?
Behold the men that make music upon instruments of
brass,
The men that smite with the racket in the courts of after-
noon tea,
They that urge the skiff over the deep waters.
They that make the wheels to spin about the black circle,
They that sit upon the chariots that smell, whom men
call the swine of the highway.
All these and more follow after the war.
Who is he that speaketh to the foe afar off?
Lo, the prophet from among the strong cattle whose
name is Bill the Bullocky, he speaketh to the foe
afar off.
Him hath the Governor-General appointed to curse the
enemy in the gate, and the curses tnat he maketh
are as the smoke of Sheol and as the wind that
breaketh the mountains in sunder.
How speedeth the battle that is joined upon the seashore?
Behold, the men of yellow countenance cannot face the
bowling, and the play is made in their twenty-five.
They are smitten on the jaw and cannot counter ; they
divide the spoil with Abraham, and they cannot pick
a winner.
So ; shall it be to all the workers of iniquity when the men
of Australia are on the job.
How are the mighty fallen ! How is the blanky cow dis-
, comfited !
They fall, they lie down, they rise ; where they lie down
there they fall, then they are kicked upright again.
Who hath done this ?
Australia, mighty in battle, behold she hath done this !
The land mighty in stoush hath wrought it !
It is the work of them that play at the wickets,
Of,them that follow hard after the ball,
Of them that ride upon swift mokes,
Of them that lay the great odds.
The land mighty in stoush hath wrought it 1
Australia, mighty in battle, behold, she hath done this.
Yet behold ! this tale of victory seemeth too dashed thin.

Toolooa ” : Diver Pashly, who is blasting
out the rooks from the mouth of the Burnett (Q.),
tells me this: “There isn’t a day hut three
sharks pay me a visit, and I look for them now.
Hurt? Not a bit of it—they’ve become quite
friendly. While I’m at work they play around.
Instantly I make for the surface they clear like a
torpedo for sea, hut they return immediately after
the explosion and have an easy feed on dead and
dying fish.”

“ Huffin-Guffin ” : What is the favorite
hush occupation of Aboliars? Have not yet seen
this discussed. I have worked at various kinds of
bush toil, and like any of them better than town
work. (Town work is better paid ; but this is
an “ Aboriginally,” not a “Political Point.”)
Wattle-bark stripping is my own favorite job.
The glories of that game, where trees of fair
size are plentiful, have to be experienced to
be appreciated. A comfortable camp, with
good water , supply, a fair price for the
bark, and its “all right.” The bark season
is limited—from September to January in
Victoria. Before or after that the bark generally
sticks, and you can’t get off good, long, snaky strips.
We use the longest and toughest strips to tie up
the bundles with. If they are not procurable,
stringybark comes handy. Wire is also used, but
I don’t like it. The bundles are generally made
up to weigh about a half cwt. each when dry. The
skilful bundler can make an almost exact 40 to
the ton every time. Wattle cultivation should be
more general than it is, especially in poor, sandy
country. But I never saw a wattle plantation do
so well as one that was self-sown. Why, I don’t
know.

“D.M.W.”: I read with astonishment
The Bulletin article on the “country that was
no good.” My previous knowledge of internal
Australia was derived from the evening hymns
and doxologies of its bards. I understood that all
Australia, from a few miles west of Sydney, was
paved and metalled with the bleaching skulls and
thigh bones of pioneers who had tried to push their
way through to the pubs on the far Barcoo. The
main products of the region were supposed to be
dingoes, crows, drought, and horse-poets. Living
in a State that is blessed with rain, Joe Ward,
and the Tourist Department, I could not but pity
those who were condemned to the Australian
Hades. Your article has led me to reconsider the
matter. Could you get a few gross of bards to
reconsider their verses, and sort of start things
afresh ?

The Commonwealth trawler’s jubilant re-
turn to Sydney from its first experimental
trip “ outside ” recalls an early-day fishing
expedition. In 1859, N.S.W. Governor Deni-
son and the late Daniel Cooper clubbed
together to send the trawl-net exploring
along the coast south of Sydney, in search (princi-
pally) of turbot and other flat fish. The 80-ton
schooner Catherine Agnes, owned by Captain
Broomfield, ferried the adventurers—the recently-
deceased Captain Francis Hixson (then master of
H.M.S. Herald), E. S. Hill, Captain Broomfield,
and seven Herald sailors. On January 29 the
trawl was let down in Sydney Harbor, and
yanked up a few flathead ( Platycephalus ), one
John Dory (Zeus), and a catfish or two (Pimelodes).
Next day the party had a try outside, between
the Heads and Bondi, but found nothing save
about 30 fathoms of water and an enorm-
ous quantity of horribly rocky bottom.
Rough weather hunted the adventurers into
Botany Bay, and bottled them up till February 4.
They whiled away the interval telling each other
fish yarns, and dredging up a few flathead, a
plaice or two, and one lone, lorn sole. After that
the fishermen scooted back to Sydney for more
whisky. They put to sea again on Feb. 6, and in a
two-mile trawl between Bellambi and Wollongong
collected enough marine cacti and small animal
items to found an aquarium, but gathered in no
fish. Next they had a shot at Jervis Bay, but the
proposed Federal port only panned out a solitary
stingray, a lonely John Dory, and more or less
oysters. Shoalhaven Bight and the deposit from
Lake Illawarra didn’t even yield the customary
John Dory, and the expedition scuttled home in
disgust. The operations resulted in a debit
balance of £46 Bs. 4d.
Edyson ” : The Australian bush breeds
absent-minded beggars. Practically every man
who has spent his life in the bush becomes quaintly
automatic and dominated by habits rather than
intellect. Eggly is an extreme instance in point.
Eggly lives at Gembrook (Vic.) under an alias.
He is a settler, and has been in the act of settling
for quite 25 years. Strange, by the way, how long
it takes some men to quite settle in Australia.
Men who wfere settlers 20 years ago are settlers
still, and are likely to be until they settle perma-
nently under the soil. Eggly has been carting
water on an absurd sled, drawn by a bumble-
footed bullock, ever since he made his home at
Gembrook. This summer a barrel was towed up
from the creek every morning. The second
night after my arrival it rained rivers, but
the first thing I saw on turning out was
Eggly prompting his splay-footed quad-
ruped up the hillside with a full barrel
aft. It was still raining, and Eggly was
wet through. When he arrived he found
the tank full, therain “barT’full, and all
the tubs were overflowing. He looked at
them in sober amazement for a full
minute, scratching his head under his
hat. Then he said : “ Well, I’m durned,
there ain’t no water wanted this mornin’!
Gee off. Bally ! ” So he turned his bumble
bull round, and drove his sled a quarter
of a mile down the hill again, and emptied
the water back into the creek.

“ Vigilans ” : Louis Albertson,
fisherman, caught an immense ray, the
other day, on the long beach at South
Keppel Island (Q.). The monster was
13ft. long, lift, across, and weighed over
a ton. The mouth, or front door, was
2ft. 6in. across. And, as though an
opening of that size wasn’t enough, it
had two tentacles, or claspers, Sin. wide
and 3ft. long, dropping out dr the corners
of the mouth, the better to ladle in food.
Albertson caught the fish in his net and
drew it ashore ; but it was too big to haul
in, so the fishermen cut off the head and
claspers, and brought them in to Rock-
hampton. This ray is identical with the
sea vampires, or devil fish, of the coast of
South America ; there they stretch out to as
much as 25ft. long. Instances are known of
them coining in contact with a ship’s cable
And dragging the anchor some distance. I
believe this is the first of the kind caught off
the Australian coast.

Harris Weinstock, an official visitor from
California, has been remarking the weaknesses of
Victoria to the Melbourne press:—
When I rode through mile after mile of country as
arable as any on the globe, and hardly saw a dwelling, it
seemed a pity to me that there should be such
woeful waste. And where you get the water
there is still waste. In California our irrigation is all
done by private enterprise. The company makes its pro-
fit by supplying the water. ... lam amazed at the low
rates the Vic, Government charges for water. ... In Cali-
fornia you do not see Victoria’s long vacant spaces along the
water channels. The landholders have agreed to use the
water, and they must pay for it. For a Government or
anybody else to spend hundreds of thousands or millions
on irrigation schemes, and then allow the landholders to
use, or refuse to use, the water as they may desire, seems
to me very reckless. The water must be used on
all the land through which the channels pass, or irriga-
tion cannot possibly succeed.
Victoria is making a great name for itself as the
Paradise of the Non-Productive Landholder.
Thus far he has escaped taxation on the un-
improved value of the land he is holding for
a rise. And when the Government has improved
his land with irrigation channels, he isn’t even
taxed to pay for the improvement if he persists in
his policy of non-productiveness, and allows the
water to run to waste.
Two amphibious seals have been making
themselves rather a nuisance at Port Lincoln
(S.A.). They were so bold that the Port agreed
not to hurt them, and after that they simply
came up from the beach and flopped about the
streets, and citizens going home at night would
fall over a moist object resembling a small whale.
The younger one was found at last in someone’s
fowl yard, and had to be spoken to severely and
reminded of the awful circumstances attendant
on the Opening of the Second Seal in the Book of
Revelation. After that they departed.
HOW TO SPEAK CORRECTLY .
"Say, blokes I We gotter bonzer book ’ome—tells
yer orl erbout 'ow to tork.”
“ Kangaroosfcer ” : On the Casuarina Islets
(locally known as the “Brothers”), to the S.W.
of Kangaroo Island (S.A.), sealing was a profit-
able game 30 year's ago; and even now these lonely
rocks are a favorite resort for the “ clap-hatchie ’’
with her litter of pups, and later on for the old
“wiggs.” Skins of the fur-seal in those days
were worth 255., and the blubber another 4s. 6d.
Old sealers assert that seals always carry “ bal-
last” in the shape of stones (six or seven), the size
of a golf or tennis ball, which are ejected from the
stomach in the breeding season, and swallowed
when the “ hollus-chickie ” takes the long trail
again. On the “ Brothers” little heaps of these
alleged ballast stones are to be seen in the caves
and on the beaches, worn as smooth as glass; and
an old identity states that he has repeatedly seen
the seals ejeoting them. But old sealers don’t
always speak the pure and unadulterated, so per-
haps some gentleman in the Murrumbidgee
whaling trade will chip in with a few authentic
remarks.

Shadow ships of the Silence, slaves in an alien

Out on the Border Stations, out on the Open

Are they loathing the Brown Men—tools of the

Only because they’re helpless, only because

Out on the Pads for ever until the day they

Trudging the Great Lone Pathway, journeying

Grim grey ghosts of the Deserts, haunting a

M.W.D.: Good idea, spoilt by weak lines
Dorrigo: “ Put the knife through it.” Oh, no ;we just
laid it gently to rest in the basket Hughenden: Not
too bad, but lame finish spoils it Anna Mary: Treat-
ment hardly powerful enough to redeem such a hack-
neyed situation J.W.McC.: So-called “poem” is no
good. In the case you suppose, the copyright would
lie with the paper, though the claim would pro-
bably not be enforced Tramp: None of them
quite up to the mark Feng Qui: Unquestion-
able truths, but they have been stated before
Ernest O.: You versify well, and have the lyrical faculty
highly developed, but your sentiments are theatrical and
trashy Squibbs : Both rather silly 0.M.G.: We
haven’t space for cricket cartoons; the subject isn’t
nearly urgent enough Pirriro: Humorous, but a
thought too insane F.H.0.: Fact that the “breeze
sighs soft” and you are “lone” has been recorded in the
office archives Geelong Anglican: Tired of Arch-
bishop Olarke ; tired of Nash ; tired of Geelong; dead
tire^i; dog tired Joe: “Dulcet the Dreamer” is a
very sketchy fragment G. E. Mac.: Reads like reality,
but is quite out of our line R.B.H. : “ Tim ” is hardly
strong enough of interest. Will inquire about the other.
....W.J.L.: Reasonably well written, but has hardly
“go” enough....Pendennis: Kissing the wrong lady is
an ancient device... E.S.B. : Has some pathos, but the
workmanship is too rough.... Anvil: Too much dialect,
and in any case the thing is belated G.B. : That
sort of cheap Yankee humor is fast becoming a
literary nuisance.. ..Lesna: Too jerky and erratic....
The Orchid: Rickety verse. The whole humor of the
par. resides in the fact that Boileau and the bagman used
foul language to one another, and that is insufficient jus-
tification for any par The Wasp: “A Sensitive
Larrikin” is interesting as indicating that even the
chronic pushite possesses a Heart sometimes:
“Break up the bloomin’ party, lads,”
Exclaimed the pride of the push, Long Ned ;
“ I’ve just been told by some old bloke
A poor woman next door lies dead.”
“We can’t help that,” replied the flash M. 0.;
“She’s free from care and pain,
And the report of a cannon could not wake
The old girl up—again.”
“ We’ll hold no party in this house,”
Firmly resumed Long Ned ;
“ I’ve been a bad egg in my time, $
But I’ve a little respect for the dead.”
... .Cict: Blow and dash the Chow’s kindly treatment of
his horse. We are sick of it. As a moral asset it is as
time-worn as the Bilandersonian hero’s resolve not to lay
his hand on a woman unlessin kindness G.M. : When
a bard writes about quiet, deserted, November woods we
suspect his verses of being stolen from a magazine in
some country where November is a silent, lone, leafless
month. In this country the wood is more joyous in
November than at any other season L’Fou : The bush
fire has been often described and often better described.
.... Caro : There are so many tales about the person who
dies of thirst, with the crow on the dead tree watching
him, that we almost feel as if we could slay that crow in
cold blood. It would be a change to have the deceased
watched by a sparrow ora condor The Battler: Not
wildly enthusiastic about either of them.... Alex E.: “A
Ferry Boat” consists of two sketches. The first one
would make a good social paragraph M.H.P.: Alas,
the elderly spinster has sat in verse by the fire 1897 times
already, and dreamed of the 1897 men she should have
married, and the 11,372 children who should have been hers
....Vegetarian : Good on the whole. Pity there are such
weak spots as the third line of the fourth stanza
Nahum Barnet: Mere bathos ...G.H. : Conventional
sentiment—which remark applies to all verse having
reference to “ the mopoke’s call ” and to corpses which
“care naught” as they sleep where the shadows creep,
etc Ellie: Certainly not. If we answered all the pars
that are sent in the paper would become replete and burst.
. ... W.G.L. : Bald account of how a tall man slept in a
double bed. The incident is devoid of public interest
M.L.W.: Verses of that type which come along with
neither name nor address labor under a heavy suspicion
that they are not original. That suspicion headed
“ Dreamer” off into the bottomless pit.. ..Crip : Now, do
you want six months, or do you want us to get six months ?
That sort of thing ends in six months for somebody for cer-
tain.. ..George War : You pall hera bush type. Nonsense.
Where did you ever see one like that, let alone a whole
class?. ..Texas: “The enclosed photo.” evaporated en
route ; anyway, nothing was enclosed except a local
grievance,...Agnes R.: Four jokes, and three of them
certainly stolen. You seem to have a career before you.
Toolooa : Too stilted and artificial. “ Wireless ” the
best of the three. Coreena: There’s a good touch or
two in it; but the woman who neglected her appearance
so that her husband went out every evening, and then at
length furbished herself up so that he stayed in—that
good soul has done so much service that we have
pensioned her off F.J.H. : “The Toy Boy” is well-
nigh as obscure as “A Dabbler in Verse,” which is
obscurer than Anti-Sosh G.V. : One couplet strays in
as a curiosity, though it reads more like a Willy Kelly
rallying cry than a sane utterance :
So fear not, White Orstralia, buck up and go to sleep,
The storm may rage around you, but yer Mother’s on the
Deep.
Pedagogue : “ Juvenile attempt at satire ” is painful,
a remark which applies to all efforts of the sort.. The
Bud : “Nocturne ” contains a lot of poetic thought in a
crude state. Either you are unhappy in your choice of
metre, or you have a defective verse ear .. Scribbler:
Neither “ Daybreak ” nor “ Books” is poetry.. ..C.A.P.L.:
One verse as a horrible example :
Just think how on earth we will stand,
Thoughtful Australians !
If Germans get the upper hand,
English Australians !
Why we will be all on our own,
And we’ll lose our new happy home,
To some strange chaps across the foam.
Patriotic Australians 1
.. ..Les R.: It doesn’t fulfil the promise of its beginning.
.. ..Wally Lee : It struggled for a few moments with its
fate.. ..F.L.L.: Nothing to recommend it.... Rose J.:
Too much word-spinning, though the finish is rather
neat T.M.H.: Has a faint sparkle here and there
Spin : You don’t make your meaning clear enough. As
the thing is put, the general reader would grossly mis-
understand you Smoky: Verse weak. Prose sketch
better.. ..Mark Antony : But why couch it in Cockney
dialect?....R.T.B.: Too many slumps in it....8.D. :
“Memories of Early West Coast Days’’are too like all
other memories. In journalism it is advisable to remem-
ber something new or be silent P. Sullivan : “Wreck
of Wrack Wanderer” occurred on the reef of Evil Gram-
mar and Worse Spelling Peter Oetzen: No; the
Australian who put Burns down for eight seconds was
Bill Lang.

That enterprising Westralian youth, J. J.
Simons, has completed arrangements for the inter-
change of schoolboys between Australia and the
United States, and 40 ’Frisco youngsters are now
on their way to the West. Simons is a sort of
self-appointed Minister of Picnics, and has
probably run more affairs of the kind than any
other man in the Commonwealth, though he is
still only a youngster. Home Minister Mahon
ought to secure him tp organise excursions
to the lovely Yassberra capital. Simons is
a good Australian, an A.N.A. man, a Protec-
tionist, and anti-Jingo, and is just now getting
himself shoved off various platforms in Perth for
opposing the Dreadnought excitement.
Thus “ Westerner ” :
Isidore Emanuel, one of Westralia’s meat kings, who
counts his holdings by the million acres, is honoring Mel-
bourne with his presence just now. Issy is the fattest
mammoth in the ring which rules the cattle trade in the
West, fixing the price at which the small squatter must
sell, and likewise the price at which the butcher must
buy. In private life Issy is a genial person, with a taste
for motor-cars, racehorses, and diamonds. With his
fellow-squatters, he gave evidence before the Meat Com-
mission to the effect that the industry was on the verge
of ruin, and that he was personally losing untold
thousands every year. Shortly after Issy waddled into a
Perth theatre one night, after an expensive feed. Diamonds
gleamed from every available angle of his anatomy.
Plebeian persons held their breath at his entry, the actor
people held up the show until the gorgeous Issy dropped
into his seat, and the band played “ God Save the Ring ” !
An irreverent voice from the gallery greeted the resplen-
dent squatter : “ Wot O ! the starving meat king ! ”
“S.’ : Max Hirsch used to wax bitter
over the non-success of his "Victorian Shoddy-
importing crusade. “ I preached single-tax in
this country for fifteen years,” he said, “and
yesterday a man—an old friend, too —said to me,
‘Hirsch, what is this single-tax of yours?—a tax
on bachelors ?’ ”
Mrs. Catherine Newton, who died at
Orange recently, aged 86, was, with her husband,
Adam Newton, one of the immigrants whom Dr.
Lang imported to stem the growing tide of
Hiberniauism. They both turned Romanists
shortly after their arrival, to the intense annoy-
ance of the doctor, one of whose few weaknesses
was a confirmed tendency towards Dillism. The
Newtons were in business as bakers in the early
’forties, in Clyde-street, Miller’s Point, right
among the whaling people ; later on, they opened
in Kent-street, and in the early ’fifties they were
in King-street West. There the sign still stands
good, the business being conducted by one of old
Adam’s descendants.
A pitiable spectacle at the Melbourne
Dreadnought or Deadhorse meeting was Premier
Murray. Standing big and burly, in plain sac
suit and with hands grasping his coat-collar, he
looked the strong Australian Democrat of years
agone ; but the speech was the speech of a windy
time-server, a truckling weathercock, apologetic
even in his pumped-up enthusiasm. Yet but a
few days before he had put the case for the manly,
self-reliant side to the Geelong Natives’ Confer-
ence—Britain may want a Dreadnought, but we
need a navy more. It was a pitiful showing ; an
open, shameless turning of his coat. The man
who really believes in the Dreadnought idea is
entitled to respect,; but for the man who waits a
few days,'and then makes up his mind that the
crowd is shouting a certain way and shouts with
it, there can’t be anything but pity or contempt.
Sydney’s one and only “Sammy” Lees,
who has sailed for England, bids good-bye to
public life in Australia, but, like most victims of
bad habits, he will probably begin to yearn once
more for the Lord Mayor’s chair when he has
rested. He has been in Sydney Council since
1879, and has been in and out of the Legislative
Assembly for many years.' Though he often ex-
pressed himself tired of the glare that lit his
throne,-lie wouldn’t stay out of Parliament when
defeated, but fled back at the earliest opportunity.
Probably the most noteworthy thing about his
career was that he once ran his profitable printery
in a spot called “ Lees’ Court,” where Bluebeard
Deeming, the plumber and hearthstone wife mur-
derer, once plumbed, and where Kate Kelly at an
earlier period delivered addresses on her noble
brother, bushranger Ned. Deeming and Kate
failed to make money in the Court, but Lees
raked it in with both hands—which proves that a
cute cult of Methodism and Orangeism is a surer
money-getting line than either wife-murder or
bushranging. In fact, very few bushrangers have
a big credit balance at the bank.
Rev. J. B. Ronald, Victoria’s parson-poli-
tician,, spends most of his time in the courts these
later days. In addition to his action against
Robert Harper, he had a legal brush recently
with a lady typist, who sued him for “work and
labor performed.” Ronald is a Scotchman, with
an accent you could cut with a cheese knife. He
has been a Presbyterian pulpit-banger for the past
18 years,, most of the time at Oakjeigh (Vic.). He
was selected as Labor candidate for the Melbourne
Ports Federal seat in 1901, and won in a canter.
Ronald steered an erratic course in the House,
and made more “personal explanations” than
even Joe Cook. The Labor party soon tired of
him ; and when the Orangemen and Pleasant
Sunday Afternooners, who had enthusiastically
supported him as a “staunch Protestant,” dis-
covered him in the act of aiding and abetting
Higgins in an Irish Home Rule motion, Ronald’s
stock ceased to be quoted on the market. The
Labor party refused to run him again ; so he
stood as an Independent, and was badly defeated.
A RAMPART OF WAISTCOAT.
LONG ’UN: “ Yes, and then he banged the door

From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
Re the late Joe Thompson (B. 11/3/’O9), when he and
Isaac Coleman married the handsome sisters Barnett at
the Melbourne Registry Office, the ladies were both
employed at the Caite de Paris, in Bourke-street. Thomp-
son and Coleman opened a cafe in Bourke-street, not far
from the Caf6 de Paris. It was an all-night house, and
some very exciting transactions took place there. The
sisters induced their husbands to give up the cafd, which
they did after a trial in the Supreme Court (criminal
side). In November, 1867, Joe Thompson and two others
were gambling with a butcher and amateur bookmaker
named Ashton. The latter complained that he had been
“ taken down ”by the trip. Ashton and a friend were so
persistent in declaring that “ a grey ’’had been used
that the P.M. had no option but to commit. At the
higher Court a verdict of acquittal was recorded, but the
trial put up the shutters of the cafd. Mr. Ashton disap-
peared soon after, leaving many commercial people
lamenting.
Grattan Gray, who was fired from his job
as chief Hansard reporter in the Maoriland Par-
liament for alleged “ un-British ” utterances
during the Boer disturbance, is back from Yankee-
land with a book on that much-written-about
country. Grattan has several previous convictions
as an author, the last being for “ Australasia Old
and New.” He was one of a long procession of
editors who endeavored to save the Perth
Morning Herald from the fate which has lately
overtaken it. A short, stout personage, Grattan
Gray looks the least likely man in the world to
be “ un-British.”
WHAT WILL WE DO WITH OUR BOYS?

“Dandalup” writes :
Andrew Dempster, ex-M.L.C., who discarded the mortal
coil recently at Muresk (W.A.), was a well-known figure
in the early days of Westralia, His father was one of the
pioneer settlers, and Andrew and his brothers were all
born in the State. In their youth they were famous for
their feats of exploration, and in 1860 the young
Dempsters were the first white men to penetrate the then
awe-inspiring and mysterious wilds of the east and south-
east districts. On their first trip in to the east they actually
traversed the Yilgarn Goldfields between the present s'tes
of Southern Cross and Coolgardie, but, although they
collected geological specimens, they didn’t find any nug-
gets. If they bad, then the history of Australia would
have borne a very different complexion at the present
time. In 1863 they went right through to Esperance, and
took up 304,000 acres of good land for sheep and cattle
runs. For many years they were the only settlers in
this wide expanse of country, but their loneliness was
compensated for by their ever-increasing bank balances.
In 1865“ Andy,” accompanied by a friend and a black-
fellow, attempted to penetrate the country north and
north-east of Esperance ; but after crossing the rich,
gold-bearing Dundas Hills, they were forced back on
account of the shortage of water. In time the Dempsters
also became large land, owners in the fruitful Northain
district ; and after growing exceedingly fat and enor-
mously affluent as far as worldly wealth is concerned,
both Andrew and Charles were duly consigned to the
Westralian Upper House of Impossibles. And now they
have both been removed, and have left all their land
behind them.
“ Leges” writes a confused tale about an
English ex-M.P. and ex-gaolbird, lately deceased
(The Bulletin admits that its head is buzzing
horribly with its efforts to sort out all the charac-
ters in the narrative): —
Never satisfied with conventional explanations, I have
been studying the Roupell case. It is not an absolutely
settled affair, like the Tichborne case. On the whole, I
concur with the generally accepted view, but let. me give
full weight to all that makes against it. The Judge who
tried Roupel], criminally, was Justice Byles, author of
“ Byles on Bills.” Never a more acute man on legal docu-
ments of every kind. In his summing-np, after Roupell
pleaded guilty to colossal forgeries, there is just the very
faintest glimmer of a hint that possibly the confession
might be false. Said Byles, “ Whether what you saj r is
true is only known to you and your Maker.” Now why
should he say - that? Roupell was condemning
himself to imprisonmmt for life. That means 20
years. Roupell was freed in 1876, after only servin': 14
years. To see what lam driving at, consider the mstory
from a beginning.
Early in the 19th century, there was John Roupell,
a marine store dealer (rags’, bones, iron, lead, etc.). He
amassed money. His son was Richard Roupell. Richard
kept a mistress at Peckham. Their illegitimate son was
William, the forger. Richard never told his father. As
soon as the father died, Richard honorably married the
woman, and took her to live in good style at Rrixton. A
legitimate, son, Richard, junior, was born.
Now comes in William’s confession. Richard Roupell,
the father, developed an enormous lead-smelting business.
William, who bad begun with some valuable education as
an attorney, managed the smelting, and was implicitly
trusted by his father, whom be allegedly swindled of
about £130,000 by forging deeds. The circumstances
would be scouted as incredible in any novel. He forged
TO important documents which were subjected to the
scrutiny of keen business men.
Now the climax. His father died in 1856, leaving a
duly attested will. It left the property in general to
Richard junior, who had become a pet, a little Benjamin.
William destroyed this will, and forged another leaving
everything to his mother. She was as pliant in his
hands as his father had been. The estate realised
£200,000, with which William made ducks and drakes.
According to his own account, he was neither a gambler
nor a libertine. He simply lived in the most aristocratic
fashion, up to the income of a duke. It cost him nearly
£lO,OOO to get into Parliament. He was M.P. for Lam-
beth. At last he came to the verge of insolvency. Then
he started actually going about and telling everybody
concerned that he had forged all the aforementioned
deeds and his father’s will as well. The properties left
bv his father, and valued at £200,000, had increased to
£300,000 value in other hands. Now he told all the owners
that the £300,000 belonged to his brother Richard.
First they said be ought fo be sent straight to Golney
Hatch or Bedlam. However, this tune changed. The
buyers agreed that it was a monstrous conspiracy between
William and Richard. William then went away to Spain;
Richard began an action against one Waite, to recover
a property worth £15,000, called Norbiton, in Surrey. This
was one of those which William had acquired by forgery,
and sold. The case came before the Civil side at the Guild-
ford Assizes. William came back voluntarily from Spain,
and confessed in court to all the forgeries, including
the will. Thus Richard was left heir-at-law. Bovill, as
counsel for the defendant, fought the case obstinately, on
the ground of conspiracy. However, the legal instru-
ments would apparently not bear scrutiny under the
searchlight of William’s confession. The case was settled
by Richard and Waite agreeing to divide the property.
Other cases followed. Richard recovered heaps of pro-
perty. William was committed to Horsemonger-lane
Gaol. His trial came off a month afterwards. It is very
peculiar, almost suspicious, that during the month there
was no communication whatever between him and his
relatives. Further peculiar that he pleaded first “ Not
Guilty ” and then “ Guilty.” He said he wrote hit auto-
biography in gaol, but it never came to light.
Mr. Richard Hale Budd, the oldest of
retired civil servants, died lately at Brighton
(Vic.), aged 94 years. He reached Melbourne in
1840, and squatted until 1846. Then the Anglican
denominational school was founded, and he was
its headmaster until 1855. In that year he
became an inspector under the Board, and when
fotate education happened along he was made
Inspector-General. He inspected generally until
1872, when the present Act came into force, and
then he retired on pension. So he was a pen-
sioner for 37 years—the very Methuselah among
pensioners.
Melbourne has one strong-man solicitor in
“Jack"’ Ebsworth, who might, perhaps, still be
safely backed against any other lawyer on
earth with the gloves on. Ebsworth was some
years a sailor, and what time he was an
officer of a sailing ship he distinguished
himself as an all-round athlete in some
sports at Calcutta. The late Lord Bill
Beresford, judging at the sports, got
hold of Ebsworth and induced him to
take on the local heavyweight cham-
pion boxer in a go at the Corinthian
Theatre. Ebsworth, with the worst
of the weights, gave the champion
a beating—in the fifth round. He
was a good sprint runner, and his
quick feet helped to make him a
very formidable man in the ring.
Besides, he has a phenomenal
reach for a man of his inches (sft.
9£in.), as any client can see when
he stretches out his arm for a
cheque. If he puts out both arms to
make the sign of the cross, Ebs-
worth measures 75£in., which is
more than Jack Johnson’s
stretch. Talking to this middle-aged
man of law, and listening to his
yarns of the days when he foregathered
with Charlie Mitchell, “Tug” Wilson,
Joe Goss, and other pugs of the period,
it is hard to believe that Ebsworth could
be engaged by a client to issue a writ in
a case of assault and battery. Probably he
would want to get plaintiff and defendant
into his office, and put the mittens on ’em and
, act as referee.
Broken Hill has got into the habit of
having Labor mayors, and, in conformity with
its one-man-one-job creed, it refuses to allow its
mayor to do anything else while he is mayoring
on a salary. Just at present the distressful
mining town has anti-Capital in a severe form,
and in order to show that Jack is a darned
sight better than his master it dredged up the
roughest diamond in the party, and made him
head of the city. Council meetings have since
then become quaint affairs. “ But, Mr. Mayor,”
one mildly-protesting alderman started the other
day. “ Here, none of that funny business,” said
Mr. Mayor—“none of ‘your Worships ’ or ‘ Mr.
Mayors ’ for me.” He proceeded to show that he
was going to practise what he preached by
addressing his council as “ You blokes,” and that
has now settled down to be the general form of
address.
PUBLIC NOTICE.
About a sporting family :
Leonard Grimwood, who died in Melbourne last week,
was one of the best-known sportsmen in Murray’s capital.
He was a champion pigeon-slaughterer, a dabster at
driving' trotters, something of a boxer, and more of a
billiardist. He was a brother of “ Old Sam ’’ Grimwood,
Melbourne’s oldest sporting identity. Sam is now over in
Perth, where he emerges into the limelight occasionally
to referee a local scrap or wrastle, or to teach the young
idea how to play billiards. Thirty years ago “Old Sam”
was one of the biggest bookmakers in Melbourne, and
was chairman of Bowes’ Tattersall’s Club. Two other
brothers (both first-class boxers) are away in San Fran-
cisco piling up dollars as building contractors. “Young
Sam” Grimwood (son of “Old Sam") has been.for many
years past judge for the W. A. Turf Club and the three
proprietary racing clubs in Perth.
OUR CORDITE FACTORY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Minister of Defence (Senator Pearce) will to-morrow
pay a visit to Maribyrnong, in order to examine the pro-
posed site of the Commonwealth cordite factory. The
Minister will be accompanied by Mr. T. Hill (director of
works in the Home Affairs Department), Mr. 0. N. Hake,
and Mr. Pethebridge. All that the Ministerial party will
do will be to inspect tbe site, as there are no building:
operations going- on. . . . At the beginning of last year
the then Minister (Mr. Ewing) explained that it was only
a matter of getting a man or two out from England and
the work could immediately go ahead. . . . Mr. Leighton,
the officer who has been engaged in India to supervise the
business, has not yet arrived. . . . Another Minister is
going out to inspect the sit e.—Daily paper.
Moving soberly and slow,
See the site-inspectors go—
Mister Pearce and Mister Ewing, Mister Blank and Mister
Dash;
Brothers Pethebridge, Hill, and Hake,
These are trailing in their wake—
And the whole are animated with a dread of movements
rash !
Very carefully and calm
Hear them lift their mellow psalm :
“Let us linger, O my brethren, as we lingered years
agone.
Ere we build it here or there,
Let us view the prospect fair,
Let us weave the Red-Tape garlands round each dusty
pro and con. !
It is true we face the sea,
And we need this factory—
For our boasted guns are empty as the hollow void of
night.
So we do not wholly shirk,
We are really hard at work
Leaving Ministerial footprints on that often-mentioned
‘site’."
Mister Leighton—where is he?
No one knows. Perhaps at sea—
P’raps aboard the Flying Dutchman, sailing east by west
and north;
He’s the captain and the crew—
He’s the cook and pilot too,
And he’s driving for Jehannum or maybe the Firth of
Forth 1
He may cruise beyond the shore
Of Japan or Labrador—
He may perch upon an iceberg, shedding many a frozen
tear;
Through the tangled mist of dreams
Lo, this Fact emphatic gleams—
Mister Leighton is not working—lndia’s genius isn’t
here!
He may sit in far Bombay,
Or mayhap in Mandalay
He may be beside the Ganges—these are all his own
affairs.
He may stand upon the Ghauts,.
Thinking large, important thoughts—
He may be in old Benares. Who the Devil knows or
cares?
Do not waken Mister Hake—
Gently step, for Pearce’s sake—
Through the departmental keyhole wails the wraith of
Ewing shrill;
“Need to get a man or two
Out from England ”—sool him 1 Shoo I
Gracious ghost, depart instanter, or you’ll wake poor
Mister Hill I
Then once more they view the site,
And they feel awakened quite—
Now and then they take the levels or, maybe, prepare a
plan.
‘‘So it’s very plain to see,”
Quoth our watchful enemy—
“ Yea, ’tis very clear Australia will belong to old Japan ! ”
From the Monkey’s point, you see,
Things are perfect as can be,
For there isn’t any progress, and we might as well be
dead ;
In the shelter of the tomb
We may hear the cannon boom,
But to-day we vainly listen for the works to go ahead 1

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Probably because he tried to crowd the matter
for half-a-dozen speeches into one comprehensive policy-
speech at Gympie, Prime Minister Fisher didn’t make
himself conspicuously clear on one point. He proposes a
Commonwealth note issue ; but he didn’t put the details
of his scheme beyond doubt. One report, however, made
him say that, “ towards the endeavor to raise revenue for
the purposes indicated, mainly defence, I propose to sub-
mit a Commonwealth note issue” ; and that, at any rate,
looks fairly definite. Yet, apart from every other
feature of the scheme, if he means that he is going to
make a straight-out grab at the £lOO,OOO or so
per annum which he thinks the note issue would
yield, he will have mighty hard work to either wheedle
or bullock the proposal through. The Bulletin cordially
approves the Commonwealth’s note-issue ; in fact, it pro-
posed it in the first place, and pushed the scheme into
practical politics. But The Bulletin’s scheme wasn’t to
grab the profits and use them as revenue, in direct reduc-
tion of taxes. Its proposal was to follow the well-tried
and proved Canadian plan of obliging banks to hold 40
per cent, of their cash reserves in Government paper-
money. At present, that would give the Government
immediate command of about £10,000,000. Against
that, it would probably be well for the Govern-
ment to keep about £2,000,000 in gold. Sup-
posing for any reason the Australian bank reserves
were reduced, then, of course, the amount of the
Government notes whichit was compulsory to hold would
be correspondingly reduced: in other words, the Govern-
ment could be called upon to redeem a certain proportion
of its paper. It isn’t likely that there will be any large
reduction, but it is possible, and that possibility must be
guarded against by the Government holding a gold
reserve. But £2,000,000 would be ample for the purpose ;
for that much would provide for a reduction of £5,000,000
in the cash reserves of the banks. It is true that the
banks’ cash reserves might easily shrink to that extent.
But under The Bulletin’s scheme it wouldn’t matter if
they did, because its idea is, not to “ blew ” the money on
gunpowder and other non-realisable assets, but to
buy up State debt with it. Thus, assuming that the
Commonwealth obtained £10,000,000 in gold, it would in
return hand the b inks £10,000,000 of paper money; and
against that paper money, as security for the banks’
£10,000,000, it would hold £2,000,000 of gold and £8,000,000
of State securities. The banks would thus not be one
cent worseoff than they are to-day. If there was a run
on their coin, they would be entitled to steadily draw on
the Commonwealth ; and if a bank reached the awful
point at which it had only £lO left in its vaults,
it would by that time have been entitled to get back from
the Commonwealth all but £4 of the gold which originally
it had handed over to the Commonwealth.
If a disastrous run of that sort happened in the
very first year, the Commonwealth would simply have to
realise some of the State securities into which it had put
the £8,000,000 ; and it would still not be out of pocket-
in fact, nobody would be out of pocket—if it could get
£lOO for securities which had cost it £lOO. At the be-
ginning of the second year, however, the banks’ security
would be even better than that; because while the Com-
monwealth would still only owe the banks £10,000,000, it
would have against that debt £2,000,000 in gold, £8,000,000
in State securities, and £280,000 in interest on the State
securities, even assuming that the £8,000,000 only
bought £8,000,000 (face value) of 3J per cent, stocks.
At the end of the first 10 years, assuming- that the annual
interest receipts were re-invested, the Commonwealth
would owe the banks £10,000,000, and would hold as a
guarantee for the repayment of the debt £2,000,000 in
gold, the £8,000,000 of State securities originally pur-
chased, and £3,284,800 of other State securities pur-
chased with the accumulating interest; so the total
security for the repayment of the banks’ £8,000,000 not
represented by gold would, by the end of 10 years,
amount to £11,284,800 ; in 20 years it would amount
to £15,918,400 ; and thereafter compound interest
would send the security bounding up at an
amazing rate. All that would be accomplished without
anybody being a penny the poorer. It would simply
arise from the fact that the Commonwealth would
take £10,000,000, which is earning nothing whatever, re-
placing it by Commonwealth notes, against which the
Commonwealth would hold £2,000,000 in gold and
£8,000,000 of State securities in the first year, and there-
after a gradually-increasing amount of State securities
until, in the 20th year, the total would be £15,918,400.
The extra £7,918,400 would be owned by the people of
Australia, and every farthing of it would have been saved
from the waste— the waste of 8,000,000 wholly unpro-
ductive sovereigns lying at present in bank vaults. If
this scheme is adopted, by the year 2000 (and people who
are crawling round to-day will be crawling round then)
the amount saved from the waste will have reached
to no less than £168,898,356. In other words, of
every £lOO of the enormous public debt now owed
by Australia, £7O will be back in Australia’s own hands.
Thus (assuming that the cash reserves of Australian banks
don’t increase in 90 years), Australia can in that period
get itself seven-tenths of the way out of debt without the
salvation costing either itself or anybody else a penni',
and that by no miracle, but bv the simple process of put-
ting to use what is now allowed to go to waste. If,
however, Australian banking business expands, and the
cash reserves consequently grow larger, and the issue of
Commonwealth notes therefore goes beyond £10,000,000,
and the four-fifths of the gold handed over by the bank is
in consequence more than £8,000,000, then, of course, the
interest earnings will be larger, and Australia will redeem
its own I O U more rapidly.

That is The Bulletin’s scheme. But, unless
Prime Minister Fisher has misrepresented himself, his
proposal is something quite different. He proposes, appa-
rently, to merely take the power to issue notes. If a
bank wants notes, it will have to go to the Common-
wealth for them. He evidently intends that they shall
go into circulation, just as ordinary bank notes
circulate now. When a bank wants £lOO,OOO in notes, he
proposes that it shall bring along £lOO,OOO in gold; and
what Prime Minister Fisher proposes to do with the gold
he doesn’t mention. Evidently, however, he proposes to
do something with it, because he reckons to make
£lOO,OOO a year out of the transaction ; and you can’t
make £lOO,OOO a year without putting, say, £3,000,000 of
gold to use. The banks of the Commonwealth have now
about £5,200,000 of notes in circulation ; Fisher there-
fore apparently intends to keep anything from £2,000,000
to £2,500,000 in gold, and use the balance. But as he
also apparently intends to use as revenue the poor little
£lOO,OOO a year which he hopes to get by way
of profit, the security won’t increase. Assume that
the £5,200,000 which he may get from the banks is kept
half in gold and half in existing State securities (assume,
in other words, that he doesn’t “blew” a penny of the
gold he gets from the banks in Commonwealth “works”).
Then, if he uses the interest as revenue, the banks never
will have more security for their money than they started
with. If the Stat securities slump, the banks will have
less security than they started with ; in other words, for
each £1 which the Commonwealth will owe, it will in that
event have less than £1 in hand. Moreover, if
Fisher proposes that the Commonwealth notes shall
go into circulation in the ordinary way, then
the Commonwealth will always be in danger of
having its notes dumped down in large quantities upon
it, with a demand for the return of the gold; wherefore
it will have to keep such a large reserve of gold, in order
to avoid the possibility of repudiation, that it never will
be able to make much profit out of the business. The
Bulletin’s scheme doesn’t involve the issue of the notes
at all (though a certain number will go into circulation,
and thus make the transaction larger and more profit-
able), and still the scheme will bring in £280,000 in the
first year, as against the £lOO,OOO which Fisher thinks he
may derive from his note issue ; and while the reserve
against the paper will never get any bigger under Fisher’s
scheme (assuming that he uses the profit as revenue),
under The Bulletin’s scheme the reserve would go on
growing bigger and bigger, until in 90 years it would
amount to no less than £178,898,356—a1l held against
£10,000,000 of the banks’ at-present unused and wasted
gold.
Prime Minister Fisher says he wants his poor
little £lOO,OOO a year for defence purposes ; and in order
to get that poor little £lOO,OOO he vaguely suggests a plan
which will be tremendously difficult to carry into
effect. Yet there is awaiting him a plan which
is likely to be of vastly greater service in the
cause of Defence. The £lOO,OOO a year which he
may possibly get will be a mere flea-bite ;
but when the time of trouble comes, and it becomes abso-
lutely imperative to borrow—or burst—then Australia
will be in a good position to go to Cohen, supposing it
adopts the other method. Assume that the trouble is
somehow pushed off until 1950. By that time, under the
scheme which The Bulletin has put forward, the sinking
fund would amount to £31,674,400 —the original £8,000,000
and £23,674,400 of accumulations—and £23,674,400 in
State securities would be a tremendous comfort under the
circumstances. Even if Australia merely stopped paying
the interest which ordinarily would be carried in to the sink-
ing fund and diverted it temporarily to defence purposes, it
would mean that, without any increase of taxation,
£1,108,000 a year would be available for a fighting fund.
Or the whole mass of securities might be pawned for
perhaps £20,000,000. Fisher’s scheme may put £lOO,OOO
a year into his hands, if he can get the thing through ;
but when the time of trouble conies, it will provide Aus-
tralia with no £20,000,000 ; and a reserve force of that
kind, built up out of waste, and accumulating with
increased velocity every year, is surely aorth more to
Australia, even from the Defence point of view, than a
doubtful annual contribution of £lOO,OOO.

The past 12 months’ profit includes £5OO transferred from
the “ unclaimed dividends” account. Twenty years ago
the capital of this co. was £162,500. It was in the begin-
ning-of that year (1889) that the Melbourne people, who
held nearly four-fifths of the shares, but had nodirect re-
presentation on the Board, began to be a little uneasy.
Within a very few years they found that they had need to
be ; for it became necessary to write off £75,000 of the capi-
tal, reducing-it to £87,500. In 1892 it was clear that the
whole thing would have to be reconstructed ; and a new
co. was formed, with a capital of £58,333 in 15s. shares.
(The capital was in 133,334 shares, but 55,556 of them
were not allotted.) Properties—over-valued pubs mostly
—were cut down to the bone ; frills of every sort were
discarded, and a very practical management took affairs
in hand. Things soon changed for the better; with
values increasing, it was not necessary to write off as
much as usual to cover depreciation ; reserves, therefore,
increased rapidly, and a few years back the unallotted
shares were issued as a bonus, being paid for out of re-
serves. To some extent, therefore, this transfer of
reserves to capital can be regarded as a partial refund of
capital. Putting it that way, recent results have been :

Whichever way you look at it, the results are a fine certi-
ficate both to the way in which Queensland has pulled
itself out of a bad hole, and to the skill with which the
management of this co. has laid hold of its chances.
As to details, this shows the Perkins position
more plainly :

The general expenses include depreciation (£1359 for the
past year ; £1694 for the year before that). Whether that
is all that is written off is not plain ; something may be
charged up to the working account of the brewery
department. The most striking feature, however, is the
increase of general expenses. It is evidently costing more
and more to get hold of a given amount of business—in
other words, competition is getting keener, and
the co. will have to hustle harder. It is also
probable that something larger will in the future have to
be provided to cover depreciation. This is partly on
account of the keener competition, which will drive the
co. to scrap old appliances and put in new ; and partly it
is because hitherto the steadily-rising wave of Queens-
land’s prosperity has made it unnecessary to write off
much for current depreciation of properties or for bad
debts. But that can’t go on indefinitely.

This co. is always changing the form of its accounts. On
the present occasion the principal changeis the sweeping
avvay of the dividend reserve, which has now been lumped
with other funds and called a marine assurance account.
The co. for many years had a paid capital of less than
£20,000 ; but it brushed itself up a while ago and began
to consider itself as a possible competitor of the Sydney
Ferries. Besides extending its ferry services it therefore
bought large slices of harbor foreshores for picnic-ground
purposes. At December 31, 1905, the balance-sheet
showed £3347 in freeholds. Just about that time the
Lane Cove and Drummoyne ferry service was bought, and
that included the Avenue pleasure grounds. Then the
co. pushed its nose further down towards the
Heads, and in 1906 bought the Clontarf, Pearl Bay,
Bantry Bay, and Flat Rock picnic places ; so that by the
end of that year the freeholds stood at no less than
£36,153. Subsequently other small purchases were made ;
but by the sale of part of the Pearl Bay estate the total
item was reduced to £34,990 by the end of 1907, and the
present accounts show £32,758 on property account,
further time-payments having been made on" properties
sold. Meantime large additions have been made also to
ferry property. At December, 1904, the item stood at
£17£35 ; on December 31, 1908, it showed £45,615. The
following comparison tells how the money has been
raised, along with some other details :

The other assets include £4300 “ secured debtors,” no
doubt mortgages on property sold. It is not possible to
say what profit has been made out of the property that
has been got rid of, when part only of an estate has been
sold ; when the parts are of different value it never
is possible to tell what profit really' has been made by the
sale of a fraction of the whole. It is fairly clear, how-
ever, that the directors believe they' have made
a profit. The weak point in the accounts is
that the amount provided to cover depreciation of
steamers is not disclosed. In the past six months the
ship item has been reduced by only £157, and the list of
steamers remains the same ; apparently' this means that
the amount written off to cover wear and tear was
£ls7 plus whatever was spent on repairs, improvements,
etc. In the previous half-year £lBOO net was written off.
On the available figures the past half-year’s results are
not brilliant. In the first place, a wretchedly small
amount was written off ; in the next place, in spite of the
extra Fleet traffic, the apparent net earnings were
less than the dividend. But if it wants to —and it some-
times does—a concern of this kind can cover up its real
position most effectually', for many .years, at any rate ; it
can, for instance, stuff profits into boats, or write down
the value of freeholds, although the unearned increment
may' really be piling up on them.

For the half-year to July, 1908, a special bonus of £3OO
was voted to the directors at the last shareholders’
meeting, and is now deducted from the profits of that
half-year. For the past term some of the figures in the
foregoing are necessarily' approximate only. The profit
for the term was £11,045 ; but it is assumed that £530
will be divided as bonus to employees. On the other
hand, of the £10,330 payable as bonus on purchases,
it is assumed that £330 will not be called for, and
will lapse. (The lapses for the past five half-years amount
to £1556, an average of £311.) The dividend is at the
rate of 10 per cent.; the bonus is 2s. 3d. in the £ on share-
holders’ cash purchases. The growth of the society
(which is not confined to the civil service, by the way) is
further shown hereunder :

The working expenses shown here do not include the
amounts written off furniture, etc., and other such vari-
able appropriations. No explanation is offered of the
increased expense rate ; probably it springs out of an
improvement in working conditions among the staff. At
any rate, it was said 12 months ago, as the result of in-
quiry, that there was room for improvement. The lia-
bilities (apart from dividends unclaimed, £2390) total
£16,458; on the other side, stock stands for £42,128,
book d'-bts for £7731, cash £3627, and other items make
the total £73,166. The business is highly profitable;
the cash basis on which practically all buying is done
enables the co. to get the full benefit of trade discounts,
and the semi-automatic way in which most of its trade
flows to it cuts large slices off the expenditure compared
with that of non-co-operative concerns.

Again and again this paper warned this society that it
was entering for Marathon races before it could walk ;
and now, at last, it has come to that conclusion itself. So
it is going to “eliminate most of the non-paying ad-
juncts,” and hopes to “go forward more slowly, but far
more surely'.” Among other things, “concentration of
trade is the only safe policy,” so all the branches that can
be closed will be closed. Unfortunately', the society can’t
undo all its foolishness. As was pointed out here on a
previous occasion—“ It dashed off with an extravagant
bonus ; and when it had to draw in its horns, trade fell
off. But it had made provision for trade on the
boom basis, so, though trade fell off, expenses
kept up. Among other things, it had plunged
into heavy borrowing; it put over £37,000 into
land, etc., in Flinders-street, besides over £20,000
into property elsewhere.” If Melbourne had been wait-
ing breathlessly for co-operative stores, this might have
been all right; but it wasn’t—it had to be educated up to
the wisdom of co-operative buying. The society, in
short, provided University' premises instead of a small
Kindergarten school—and now it has to pay interest on a
great deal of the cost; for the other part of the cost it
has to go without interest on its own money. Its own
capital is £63,341 ; it owes on mortgage £13,000, on
debentures £11,903, on overdraft £13,876, and to sundry
creditors (including miscellaneous loans) £13,587. The
total liabilities have moved up like this: —
Jan., 1908 .. .. £31,240
July, 1908 .. .. 48,514
Jan., 1909 .. .. 52,366
Meantime shareholders’ capital has been increased from
£59,377 to £63,341; and a credit balance of £3BBl has
been used up. Thus approximately £29,000 has been
absorbed in 12 months. Of this, about £19,000
has gone into the bakery (premises and machinery),
£lBOO into horses, plant, and vehicles ; and £5500 into
stock and book debts. The accounts purport to show
that a loss of £387 was made on the bakery, into which
all this capital has been put, and a loss of no less than £603
has been made on the two remote Tasmanian branches at
Queenstown and Strahan. But with regard to these
figures it has to be remembered that nothing whatever
has been charged for wear and tear or deprecia-
tion for 12 months past—even horses and vehicles
stand at the same value as they did 12
months ago. The true loss, there is no doubt,
was much greater than is shown. All this is very dis-
heartening. Just through want of ballast, these no
doubt exceedingly well-meaning people have done a
great deal of harm to the co-operative movement in Mel-
bourne ; and it is now up to them to put every lb. of
energy they own into the tough job of getting the thing
out of the mess they have got it into. And it is up to
the convinced co-operators of Melbourne—the share-
holders especially—to lend them a hand. If they don’t,
shareholders may make up their minds that their capital
will before long have to be written off as lost.

It is assumed in the last line that directors’ fees, income
tax, etc., will absorb £lBO ; and that amount has been
deducted from profits. The amounts payable in div. and
bonus are also estimated. The society, now over 40 years
old, has gone on the slow and sure principle, the only bee
in its bonnet being that it had, until recently, an objec-
tion (on principle, too !) against reserve funds. How-
ever, it has got over that. It trades strictly on a cash
basis ; when it only had enough money to buy a bag of
potatoes in the very beginning, that bag of potatoes
was its entire stock. Last half-year its purchases
ran to £51,497. Shareholders may withdraw their
capital on very short notice ; hence the society
usually keeps a few thousands in hand. On February
10 it held £9207 in cash and £4024 in Government
stock. On the other side, except to. its own share-
holders it did not owe a cent. The fine, useful concern,
which mixes a good deal of philanthropy'.with its finance,
has for some not very obvious reason just gone out of the
dairy business, but proposes apparently to give its help
to the dried and canned fruit trade.

This co., which is 35 years old, muddled through somehow
till 1903, when things were put on a better basis ; and the
subsequent proceedings have been marked by a nice,
steady increase of the reserves, a steady' reduction of the
book value of furniture, fittings, etc., and a very striking
increase in trade. As to the last, a6i per cent, bonus in
1904 only meant £282 ; now a 6§ per cent, bonus means
£654. The total liabilities are £2956; on the other
side, besides stock, etc., there is the item “Sundry
debtors £2948.” The co. works on the monthly' credit
system ; shareholder-purchasers who part up by
■ the 10th of the month are reckoned as cash
dealers; hence the book debts and the overdraft on
January 31. As the interest paid for the past 12
months was only £3, it is clear that the co. isn’t often and
for long in debt to its bankers. Presuming that the stock-
taking values are all right, the position and progress of
the little concern are both very satisfactory ; and, with
an increase in the turnover, the customers’ savings ought
to be considerably greater than they are now.

Toowoomba, which for nearly half a century was crowded
and almost crushed to death by the sleepily-managed
and indifferently-worked big estates which surrounded it,
has had a great awakening during the past 10 years ; and
this society lias felt the effects of it in a most remarkable
manner. That there will be something of a reaction
some time or other is tolerably certain. So far, this
society' has witnessed nothing but rising values,
and consequently it has not, it claims, made
a loss of so much as a penny on any single
transaction. However, it is just as well to take heed
lest one fall, and, while tooting the triumphant horn—as
this society' has every right to do —to remember that one
can’t tell what losses are made till the slump has come as
well'as the boom. Fortunately, the society' hasn’t lost its
head and neglected reserves ; even though it now puts its
dividend up to 7 percent., it puts by over £lOOO. Still, the
advances, which at the end of 1900 totalled £11,506, now
reach £102,013 ; so the reserves are only enough to pro-
tect the risks to the extent of £4 13s. in the £loo—
most people in Australia have seen worse
slumps than that. One good thing is that,
notwithstanding the very rapid increase of advances,
nearly all the money has been provided by shareholders;
other liabilities on Dec. 31 amounted to only £14,823. So,
though the shareholders have their own money at risk,
they have for every £6 of their own less than £1 of other
people’s to safeguard and be responsible for. If that
policy is persisted in it will be a mighty comfort to the
shareholder when the slump does come.
From General-Manager Henderson, of the Aus-
tralian Metropolitan Life Assurance office : “In noticing
this co.’s annual report you say (B. l/4/’O9)—‘ It is a
scandalous thing that they (dividends) might be (cumula-
tive).’ It may interest you to know that dividends are
not cumulative in the ‘ Metropolitan,’ and that share-
holders cannot receive dividends unless there is a suf-
ficient profit to provide bonuses to policyholders. We
agree with you that it is a ‘ rotten law ’ which allows any
company to accumulate a liability' in respect to dividends
without showing same in its balance-sheet.”

On the one hand, contributions are not coming
in with much enthusiasm, and on the other hand the
prospects of the Broken Hill Prop, re-opening are so poor
that President Nulty, of the Miners’ Association, has
frankly announced that the man who can see a job else-
where'to go to had better buy his railway ticket. Even
though about 1500 men have done this since the trouble
started, the unions have found it necessary to cut down
the lock-out pay. For a time men who had been working
on the B. H. Prop, and Block 10 were urged not to seek
work on other mines ; but that rule has also been modi-
fied. It’s a curious situation altogether. Pickets still
surround the two mines ; but even if a man could pass

In the calculation of working costs in concen-
trating mills and workshops, every small item should be
taken into consideration. It is the small and uncon-
sidered factors, involving waste of power, that make for
high working costs. The type of bearing employed has a
marked effect on the power consumed in overcoming
friction. Recent exhaustive tests emphasised the marked
superiority of the Hyatt Flexible Roller Bearings over all
other types of roller, sleeve, and other anti-friction
bearings. Under equal conditions the loss of power due
to friction in Hyatt Flexibles is 23 per cent, less than
with the best soiid roller bearing, and 65 per cent, less
that with babbit metal journals. Messrs. W. and J.
Lempriere, 506 Little Collins Street, Melbourne, will be
glad to supply further information to those interested.*

Two Traction Engines are being made for the
Victorian Agricultural Department, to the design of Mr.
Kenyon, the engineer-in-chief, for use in reclaiming the
heavy grass-tree lands of the Heytesbury forest. Special
difficulties have been discovered in the pioneer work, and
these engines are the outcome of the experiments, and
the experience of the Austral Otis Engineering Co., of
South Melbourne, who have this work in hand. These
engines are the heaviest and largest traction engines in
the Commonwealth. They are fitted with vertical water-

the Pickets, he would be stopped by the police who are
almost as numerous as the pickets. In fact, the police
are there to see that the pickets themselves don t go on
the leases. t
Meantime the mines which are are at work feel
ouite pleased with themselves. If the B. H. Prop, and
Block 10 were in full blast, and if the B. 11. Prop, were
takirw the South Blocks ore, the world’s production of
lead would be one-twelfth larger than it is to-day. (The
world’s production of lead last year was about 985,000
tons, or a trifle more. The B. H. Prop.’s production was
83 982 tons from Dec. 1, 1907, to Nov. 30, 1908.) During
the last two or three years the stocks of lead,
in metal and concentrates, have increased very
muah; and this withdrawal of the world’s biggest
producer is giving holders a chance to work off their
stocks. After the boom of 1899-1900, the metal got down
in 1902 as low as £lO 2s. 6d. ; but in the present slump
the bottom was £l2 10s., and at present the price keeps
above £l3. So the ocher mines turn towards the B. H.
Prop., and say “ Thanks.”
The B. H. Prop, made contracts with the South
Blocks, Zinc Corporation, Block 10, Sulphide Corpora-
tion, Block 14, and Junction North; all these, except the
one with the Junction North, were to run till the end of
this current year. Provision was, however, made for a
hang-upof the sort that began on January 1, wherefore the
eos."that want toget rid of their concentrates, etc., have
the right to do it. The South Blocks found that it couldn’t
get as good prices from the foreign buyers as the
B. H. Prop, had undertaken to give ; hence it is storing
its concentrates. But while it might afford to do that for
three months or so, the management is beginning to con-
sider whether it can afford to go on doing it; for the loss
of interest isn’t a trifle. The others—except Block 10 and
Block 14—are selling for export ; the two mentioned are
sitting down, waiting for things to come round or for
something to turn up,; the something in their case being
the lead market.

The Broken Hill Prop, report isn’t all gloom.
In connection with the new zinc-making business—which
is a very different thing from the mere production of zinc
concentrates for the feeding of foreign furnaces—the
retorts are about the most important feature. They are
very short-lived implements; about 3 per cent, of them
have to be renewed every day. There was a doubt
whether suitable clay could be found anywhere handy—
there was some doubt whether it could even be got in
Australia ; nothing but a practical test could settle the
point. Now, however, after about six months’ work, the
co. is able to report that “the retorts made of Australian
clay are very good, and it will not be necessary to look
further afield.”
* <* * *
Is Broken Hill Junction North ever going to
get out of the mud ? For a time everything at the mine
was going most promisingly, and then the management
decided to put in a tube mill for grinding purposes.
Now, in tube mills used on the Barrier, lumps of
rhodonite are introduced instead of flints to increase the
capacity of the machines. Junction North ore is full of
rhodonite ; so when the same mineral is put into a tube
mill, equipped in the orthodox fashion, it is a case of
Greek meeting Greek, and between the two the lead is
powdered to slime, and much of it is, therefore, carried
away. That kind of treatment is not likely to put a better
complexion on the Junction North mill returns. Some
weeks ago the ratio of concentrates to crudes treated was
one in six. Latterly it has been one in seven. As that
loss in metal is not accounted for by a falling Off in the
grade of the ore treated, it must be put down to bad mill
work. Since January, 1907„the mill has been undergoing
a process of supposed improvement. Mill improvement
costs money. The expenditure has been very much in
evidence. The improvement is more than doubtful.
* * * IT
The Junction North is producing concentrates
at the rate of pretty nearly 400 tons per week. A con-
tract for the disposal of this product has been made to
the total extent of 2000 tons, commencing at the end of
the present month. That will only keep the company
going for about five weeks. At the end of that time,
unless the Proprietary smelters are going, or another
contract with outside buyers can be made, the mine will
be “scratchinggravel.”

Though the business hasn’t had much en-
couragement hitherto, another co. has been formed to
use some of the Monaro (N.S.W.) suow waters for wash-
ing out the gold in the Kiandra alluvial. The new con-
cern, the Rocky Plain Hydraulic Go., is to work with a
Heinecke patent jet elevator, and will draw its water
supply from the Eucumbene River.

The Kangiara North (N.S.W.) has been put on
the market in 50,000 shares of ss. each, of which the ven-
dor’s whack is 25,000, plus £l5O in cash. In return for
these 25,000 shares and £l5O the vendor apparently
hands over four pegs. No work whatever has been done,
and no ore has been found. The property may get the
Kangiara lode, though it may only be at depth ; hut
there is not much proof that the lode goes that far.
And the Kangiara lode has yet to be proved to be worth
finding, anyhow. The whole thing is a gamble, and it
would have been far better had a small syndicate done a
little prospecting work first. All the title that the vendor
has to offer is an authority under the Mining on Private
Property Act. However, a group of brokers has under-
written the whole issue, so flotation is assured—and that
is about the only thing that is assured.
Pascoe’s successor at Boppy gold mine (N.S.W.),
James Negus, has fallen on good times ; for the develop-
ment in the bottom (500 ft.) level is most satisfactory.
In Pascoe’s four .years he managed to pay 190 per cent, on
capital ; and though Negus has more capital to earn
money for, his outlook is almost as good. The ore re-
serves have ceased troubling the shareholders for several
years now, as development has kept ahead of extraction
for most terms; hut when the next accounts'are made
up it will probably be found that there has been a bigger
gain than usual this year—especially if the 600 ft. level can
he opened up by that time. At present they are belting
the shaft, down another lift of 100 ft. to reach that point;
arid the 500 ft. developments have been so good that they
don’t feel much anxipty. The least satisfactory thing
about the whole outfit is that J. Bull owns the lot, having
been introduced to it by Abraham Hoffnung.

A syndicate is pegging away at what is known
as the Wallendibby diamond mine, at Delegate, on the
N.S.W.-Vic. border. It has found two volcanic cone-like
pipes, and is sinking on both of them. In one of them at
a depth of less than 30ft. it has got into “ blue ground,”
very like that which gladdens the heart of the S’African
diamond prospector. Reports have been made on the
propert.y by Government Geologist Pittman (N.S. W.)
and Joseph Miller; the latter used to be the
Tasmanian Copper Co.’s mining mao in S. Australia, and
before that worked on the S’African diamond fields.
Pittman’s report is not’ enthusiastic. He doesn’t deny
the pipes, but he doubts whether they are diamondifer-
ous. Miller, probably a more practical man where dia-
monds are concerned, offers far more encouragement;
and so does E. J. Dunn, Victorian Government Geologist,
who had had long s’African experience before coming to
Australia. Whether diamonds will be found in the pipes
nobody can, of course, say ; but the appearance of the
gem contents of the pipes, in native form and in concen-
trates, is quite enough to encourage the syndicate to go
on with the gamble.

Great Boulder (W.A.) was estimated to have
731,426 tons, containing' 596,7920 z. of g'old, in sight at the
end of 1908. This is about 80,000 tons more than were
claimed 12 months previously; but the assay value is
nearly ldwt. less. Taking present expenditure as a
guide, the visible dividend value of the mine now
amounts to between 12s. and 13s. per share, or about 50
per cent, of the market valuation.
* * « * *
Boulder Main Reef (W.A.) has done some dia-
mond drilling with mostly indifferent results, and it now
proposes to do some more at 2270 ft. This time it intends
to try its luck by boring diagonally across the line of lode
at a depressed angle, and counts on striking the Boulder
boundary at 2700 ft. More regard, however, would be
shown for shareholders’ interests if the co. could only re-
strain its impatience and wait until the workings are
deep enough to enable the drill with some degree of cer-
tainty to stab the dividing line at a level 1000 ft. deeper.
The Main Reef’s chief speculative value lies in the fact
that it has some slender chance of getting the continua-
tion of the Boulder main shoot at depth. It may, if it is
very lucky, sight this prize packet at 3700 ft., but the idea
of it doing so at 2700 ft. is, so far as The Bulletin can
judge, a weird hallucination.

Hannan’s Star (W.A.) is thinking seriously of
getting a new type of dry-crushing mill to treat its own
ore and that of the adjoining Boulder Deep Levels, on
which it has a big pull. The two properties are reckoned
to have 130,000 tons of 7dwt. reserves between them, not
counting the better grade of ore now being developed in
the south end of the Star ; and if worked together they
might manage to pay a little interest for a time on the
last lot of capital invested. Run separately, however,
the outlook for shareholders in both companies isn’t
nearly so bright.

Shareholders in the Mount Cattlin Gold and
Copper Co. (W.A.) met in Loudon the other day, and
decided to throw in their lot with the parent Phillips
River Co. The scheme provides that the latter concern
shall pay all liabilities and the expenses of liquidation,
and transfer and allot to each Cattlin shareholder one
fully-paid £1 share for every two now held. Since the
Cattlin was floated off as a separate co. 2£ years ago it has
spent a good deal more money than it ha,s earned, and it
is the prospect of doing better under joint management
that has induced it to turn its business over to the
Phillips River Co. on terms that practically mean an
amalgamation of the two concerns. The proposal was
supported by the holders of 182,073 shares out of 200,000 ;
but the agreement provides for the purchase of the hold-
ings of dissentients by the Phillips River Co. On the
whole, the latter hasn’t done so badly. In August, 1906,
it sold the Cattlin property, which then only had a small
hole in the ground and a small winder on top, for
£lOO,OOO cash ; now, after anything between £50,000 and
£lOO,OOO has been spent in equipment, and some 40,000
tons of ore have been opened up as a result of develop-
ment,, it buys it back in shares for the same amount.

The W.A. Bank has started an action in the
Perth Supreme Court against the Princess Alix Syndicate
for the recovery of £2486 on account of overdraft and
interest. Some of the defendants deny that they were
members of the syndicate at the time the advance was
made, while the rest of them deny that they owe the
bank anything. There is hard lying somewhere, and the
Court will have to say which party it thinks deserves the
medal.

Bellevue, Ltd. (W. A.), toed the mark at another
annual meeting in London last month, when shareholders
were asked to forget all about the heaps of cash already
sunk in the property', and remember only that the last
few months of 1908 had furnished increased yields, and
that January of this .year had actually shown a working
profit. The chairman didn’t imperil his soul by holding
out any hope of dividends, but he did venture to say' that
“ while the co. hadn’t exactly turned the corner, it could
see a turning ahead.” But that turning has been ahead
so long that shareholders must be very tired by now. As
there is still between £BOOO and £9OOO in hand, the
wonder is that, in view of past fiascos, they didn’t clamor
for a division of what is left.

Melbourne had better be on its guard when it
meets the Lusitania, alias Goodenough (W. A.). This is
the Menzies’ mine that hurried the Queensland Menzies
Co. into its grave, and it hasn’t improved its reputation
since that funeral happened. Since the day's when the
small shoot of payable gold, like other similar Menzies’
shoots, gave out at shallow depth, the mine has made a
bole in the pocket of everyone who has had anything to
do with it. There is nothing in recent developments,
either, to indicate that it is anything but a duffer. The
local paper remarks that, although the price agreed upon
is £13,000, the present owner is so satisfied with the mine
that he is willing to take £5OOO in shares. The Bulletin
congratulates him on getting £BOOO in cash. Many men

Gwalia South (W.A.) lately developed the bad
habit of paying away profits as soon as they were earned,
and now it has had to defer the payment of the next
dividend until May. The co. has lately had to face a
large expenditure in new plant and development, but by'
the time the next distribution is made it should have
between £7OOO and £BOOO in hand, besides the bullion
reserve, which amounts to £1550. As it takes £4500, ex-
clusive of tax, to pay the dividend, even this won’t be a
very dazzling margin to work on.
Some shareholders in the WestraliaMt. Morgans
(W.A.) met in London lately, when condolences were ex-
changed and losses counted up. A. E. Morgans, who
directs operations in the West, was in attendance, and
made “an interesting statement concerning the pro-
perty”—which, in other words, means that he tried to
induce those present to fork out more cash. His efforts
were not successful, however, and another meeting has
been arranged to talk over things. Something like a
million and a quarter sterling has been taken out of the
mine to date ; but as the prospect of finding much else
worth having is extremely' doubtful, the co. is likely to
have some trouble in getting shareholders to find
more capital to pay off existing liabilities and sink in
development.
Alluvial mining in Victoria isn’t the dead
meat that wiseacres said it w’as when 8., M. and Co.
threw up the sponge Moolort way. Little Cathcart, one
of their cast-offs, is being punched into by George Bryant
and party in the best Maryborough style. Patchy dirt is
being got, with the gold coarse enough to tempt a mining
St. Anthony; so shares are hustling along better than
they did under the old management—though this is a
questionable benefit. Out Rutherglen way the Great
Southern is being caught by the Great Southern
Consols, and at Chiltern John Cock keeps his end
up in the Chiltern Valley. Maryborough bang's on to
Burnt Creek and the Duke and Main Leads.
On the ; Berry deep-lead system, West Berry hash t
realised expectations, but Berry United is likely to be
8., M. and Co.’s dtep-lead salvation. For a fortnights
work 4690 z. have just been got from 435 fathoms. Casting
out sand, the average is well towards the oz. per fathom.
That ought to pay well, provided the run of gold-bearing
wash isn’t narrow and costs are not too high. Any Vic-
torian manager would pay divs. on such dirt. But it isn t
too certain that “ the firm ” has yet hit on cheap alluvial
methods.

Cruel calamity last week threatened the amalga-
mation of the Lord Nelson and Lord Nelson North, St.
Arnaud (Vic.). Prof. David’s farthest south experience
wasn’t half as snow-bitten and forlorn as that of the Lord
Nelson johnnies when they learnt that one of the big
North-ites threatened, for personal reasons, to bludgeon
the deal. All was 0.K., it seems, save the little question
of secretaryship. As the Lord Nelson satellite \yho fills
that office* apparently wasn’t a persona grata with this
particular polar star, he was to go. So everything had to
be adjourned. There was much whispering and caucusing,
and eventually some suave go-betweens appear to have
settled up the difference. What beats everyone is
why a big deal should be stopped over a personal
grievance. Surely all the land-boom paddocks near
Melbourne aren’t so covered that a difference of the kind
could not be settled without jeopardising other people s
interests !

Mitta Mitta (Vic.) bucket dredge, so testifies
James Hayes, is about the best in Christendom ; and, as it
was all made in Au-tralia, that’s decent commendation. As
much could not be said of the dredge until the last bit of
imported stuff in it had been scrapped. For plant to cost
£5816, and then to want £1025 in repairs and renewals
in its early days, tells of a bad bargain in the first place,
and an overdraft in the second place. Still, with the
dredge at last Australian, and with good ground ahead,
the corner has been turned.
* * * *
The Wandiligong Dredge Co., at Bright (Vic.),
had a remarkable burst of luck about Christmas time;
but it has been having a run of the other sort lately. The
co. has two dredges at work, one at either end of its long
run of ground. A few months back both happened to be
in good, deep ground ; now by an awkward coincidence
both have got into a poor, shallow patch. The co. really
doesn’t know what it has ahead of it, for it did practically
no testing—it simply took the word of the oldest inhabi-
tant that in his day this particular bit of country was
extra-rich, and this other bit was no better than tucker.
* * * *
An aspirant for public favor is the Derby Hill
tin show, which fills two square miles of space some-
where out Briseis way (Tas.). The Ringarooma and
Cascade leads are relied upon. The Cascade lead in
the Briseis mine only carried about enough tin to the
cubic yard to coat a small saucepan ; yet why should the
contents of the lead down stream be expected to im-
prove? This throws the co. back on the Ringarooma
lead ; and that formation, so far, has not raised many
plutocrats among the tinned swells of north-east Tas-
mania, though it may yet do this if half the surmisings
of the directors are verified. Costs of the new show are
expected to be limited to £lO per ton of tin raised. An
estimate of only One part of the claim gives 38,000,000
cubic yards of drift, which, set out at lib. oi tin per cubic
yard, is computed to contain £1,700,000 worth of
tin. Kayser’s report on the Briseis floats into
view r again when One hears such flattering tales.
Forgetting such past experiences, the Board cannot help
deploring that “ the present price of shares is quite in-
adequate in comparison with the property possessed.
The Hallelujahs shouted over the Briseis, Brothers
Home, Mutual Hill, Briseis Extended, South Mt. Cameron
and the dredging shows have hardly died away, yet here
is the old refrain again ! Well, time and water will prove.

Mount Lyell (Tas.) kept its end up during its
just-completed half-year with an output of 4153 tons of
blister copper. Last month gave 669 tons blister, con-
taining 661 tons copper, 56,8150 z. silver, and 8390 z. gold,
which, at present prices, is worth £46,714. The ore
treated increased to 33,365 tons; but as the extraction
has declined to very little over Jdwt. of gold and 2 per
cent, copper, there isn’t much to boast about. Blister
copper has of late contained from £8 to £9 worth of
silver and from £5 to £6 worth of gold per ton. But the
vague talk about the bulk of the profits coming from this
source is wild. As a matter of fact, the profits are about
twice the gross value of the gold and silver contents ; and,
moreover, gross and net values are very different things,
on account of the heavy refining charges. Mount Morgan,
whose management has always been good Australian,
refines in Australiaso also does Great Cobar. And if
the Knoxes and Bowes Kellys of Mount Lyell are not
good enough Australians to do the same thing without
encouragement, then the encouragement ought to be
liberally supplied, even if it is the sort of encouragement
that the Fat co. may not relish.
* • *
Mt. Morgan (Q.) is pulling around a bit after
the set-back it received through the big underground
smash and the consequent official inquiry. In January,
wdth copper at £6O a ton, the total output was worth
£54,200 ; in February(£s7 per ton), £56,000 ; March(£s7),
£65,200. The feature of the case that looks the least
pleasant is thattbe average gold contents of both gold and
copper ores continue to shrink —those of the copper ores
especiallv. For March they were, down to s'ssdwt. To
May, 1908, the average yield was B'62dwt. Still, a
reduction in grade was to be expected. When
the first estimate was made in 1905 it was put forward
that of this auriferous copper ore the mine contained
1,212,736 tons worth 3£ per cent, copper and Bdwt. gold,
and 1,589,744 tons worth more than 3 per cent, copper
and 2Jdwt. gold. As at May 31 last, this estimate was
revised ; the richer stuff was put up to 1,280,000 tons and
the poorer to 1,700,000 tons. Beyond these ores there is
a great quantitv containing 2£ per cent, copper and
Ijdwt. gold. With improved flux supplies, even these
last-named ores will be drawn upon. Meantime an in-
creasing quantity of the middle quality is being used
to mix with the cream ; and undoubtedly that is
the right policy, especially in view of the very large
development of ore of a still lower grade.
* * * *
At the MacGregor, Cloncurry (Q.), they are
cutting out a plat in the shaft at 320 ft. The 220 ft. level
has received most attention of late. The north drive has
been taken 255 ft., and the last 55ft. has shown consider-
able improvement in the grade and smelting quality of the
ore. It is as well to note, however, that for 29ft. before
reaching the 200 ft. mark prospects only averaged 3) per
cent. Warden Linedale thought that the mine had been
subjected to'considerable leaching of minerals, which, of
course, also implies concentration of inineralsunder favor-
able conditions ; so at the present stage assays big or
little are not worth risking a fortune on. Some very
adverse opinions have been expressed about the Mac-
Gregor, hut during the last month prospects have taken
a decided turn for the better, so the mine didn’t deserve
all the blast it received a while ago.
The Cloncurry-Mt. Elliott (Q.) railway exten-
sion has been hung up for some time owing to the wet
season, but another start has been made with about a
couple of hundred men. the main Cloncurry line has
stood the wet season very well; there have been a few
washaways, but nothing at all extensive. So far, how-
ever, the'traffic over it has been very disappointing.

Brilliant P.C., Charters Towers, having worked
out most of its own famous reef, has acquired the Stock-
holm ; and, judged by recent crushings, averaging about
£3 per ton, the new purchase, despite its erratic past, may
prove a life-line to the old Brilliant P.C. It is to be given
a good chance, anyway ; a railway is being run out, and
the mine is being vigorously prospected. Levels from No.
2 to No. 5 are being worked, and deeper ground is to be
explored in the hope of finding a mineralised reef.. What
shareholders need to look for is a good development at
increased depth ; for the Brilliant P.C. is a big co., arid a
surface or shallow show of £3 sto.ne isn’t much use to it.
Mungana (Q.), which has produced so much
wealth—not far short, of £l,ooo,ooo—and given nothing-
to its shareholders, is holding its end up, in spite of the
disastrous creep at the Lady Jane. Redemption work is
in progress in the disturbed portion.. It seems likely
that the copper section in this mine will still turn out
some good ore, because it does not seem to have been
much damaged by the creep, and developments of copper
ore over a distance of 22ft. in the deepest level have
been very good. Metal recoveries have improved during
the last few' months, but against this has to be set the
slump in prices and the extra expenses through the
smash in the Lady Jane. Chillagoe has as much ore as it
can treat from the Ruddigore and other mines, and the
railway returns for 12 months, although not so good as
the previous year, will show a large profit on that branch
of the business. Good reports continue to be received
from the Daintree copper mine, over w'hich Chillagoe
has a working option. This show is spoken of enthusias-
tically by North Queenslanders. The deepest shaft is
down lOllft.

Robur is put up in packets
and in tins—each package is
distinctly marked to show the
grade of Robur it contains —
there are 4 grades altogether,
viz.:—
“Special” Grade.
No. 1
No. 2
No. 3 „
Every grade of Robur is pure
tea, the difference between
them being entirely a matter
of fineness of quality.

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Sydney, April 5, 1909.
My Dear Arint,—
Driven to poetio frenzy by this beautiful
autumn weather, I take up my bird-of-Paradise
quill and rhyme you a vignette :
I saw her on the Mosman boat
That on the Harbor plies,
And fair and slender was her throat,
And sad and grey her eyes.
Her parted lips were full and red,
The sunlight with her hair
Made a gold nimbus round her head
As she sat dreaming there.
Long did I think ere I could tell
Who ’twas that silent sat:
It was Rossetti’s Damozel
Under a Widow hat.
The Mayoral reception to the Earl and Countess
of Dudley occurs to-morrow night, after your
Akenehi has shut-down on the Letter-writing
earlier than usual, on account of the way Good
Friday is hurrying things up.
Somebody has been imparting reckless in-
formation to the Kinematograph and Lan-
tern Weekly, a London paper devoted
to the flickergraphic business. Comment-
ing on the recent scramble or clawing
match between Burns and Johnson, it divulged
the sensational untruth that Lady Dudley
was one of the two ladies present. London
Daily Chronicle rushed at the item with its
mouth open, and remarked that Quakers “appear
to have a sneaking fondness for prize fights.”
Lady Dudley, it will be remembered, is a member
of the well-known Quakerish family of the
Gurneys.
The official announcement of the forthcoming
marriage between King Manuel, of Portugal—the
youth who had the awful experience, last year, of
seeing his father and his elder brother slain before
his eyes—and Princess Beatrice, of Saxe-Coburg
and Gotha, has a sort of a kind of an Australian
interest. The lady’s father was the same Duke of
Edinburgh whom a half-witted person attempted
to assassinate at Clontarf (Sydney) in the days of
our forebears. Had the homicidal loon been less
excitable, or a better shot, the future Queen of
Portugal would never have existed, much less
acquired a young man ; for she is but 25 years old.
Princess Beatrice has been engaged before. At
about the time her present intended was having
anarchist bullets and things extracted from him, a
year ago, her betrothal was announced to Prince
Alfonso of Bourbon-Orleans. The match was
swiftly broken off. The Continental papers said
that the Princess “ had lost her heart to an officer
of plebeian birth, who, however, met with great
success in the fashionable world on account of his
very fine tenor voice ” —presumably a species of
European Thomas Bent. What has happened to
the fascinating officer —whether he has been
warned off fashion’s turf, or dropped down an
oubliette, or forbidden to bring his music with
him when he dines out in society—is not known.
Certain it is that he has become a back
number so far as the affections of Prin-
cess Beatrice are concerned. She is now as
wljole-heartedly devoted to her Manuel as he is to
her. The extent of Manuel’s joy at winning his
bride is subtly indicated in a current issue of
London Daily Mail, which pictures the young
monarch promenading smilingly in Lisbon in King
Alfonso of Spain’s hat. In cases of true love a
young man’s fancy turns, the world over, to the
wearing of another person’s hat.
I was sent some inspiring clippings from The
Inlander (a new monthly published in Perth,
W. A.) the other day. For example :
AN AUSTRALIAN COUNTESS.
Amongst the most successful of Australians is that
Victorian country girl who, many years ago, clean
bowled cricketer the Hon. Ivo Bligh, and is now the
Countess of Darnley. The story of how she met her hus-
band under romantic circumstances of the Family Herald
type is worth re-telling.
And then the story is told, ruthlessly and at
length. Under the heading “ Australian Aristo-
crats,” a list is supplied of the locally-born females
who have snared titled husbands—other than
knights. It should be clearly grasped by Dread-
noughters and other Yearners that knight’s wives
are not aristocrats. Neither, for that matter, in
99 cases out of 100 are the knights, themselves.
They are too much addicted to h-dropping and to
the wearing of solid-gold alberts and elastic-side
boots. Here is a pathetic little par. from the same
journal about Ed. VII.:—
THE KING AS A GARDENER.
Flower fanciers who fail to get the blooms they want
after all their efforts may be comforted to know that
even the King cannot grow flowers to order. He was
always fond of flowers, as his perpetual button-hole
shows; but it is only since he removed to Buckingham
Palace he has taken a keen interest in the garden. This
year he particularly desired to have a large bed com-
pletely filled with yellow crocuses ; but, as ill-luck would
have it, not a single yellow crocus attained perfection,
though there were plenty of purple and white ones.
I think the conception of that admirable monarch,
grafting away in his garden for months on end,
digging and hoeing and trenching, etc., like
mad, and carrying boned ust and buckets of water
about like any Mongol, and in a general way
toiling like Old Boots, only to find at the end of
it all that disloyal old Nature had denied him the
yellow crocuses his soul hungered for, and instead,
had lumbered on to him a worthless collection of
purple and white blooms—well, it is as tragic a
thing as any in all history.
Tethered at the Quay, the Asturias reminded,
according to an American humorist, of a huge St.
Bernard dog tied by a silken thread. All Sydney
seemed to be there on Wednesday to see the
animal unleashed. Amongst the departers were
Ironmaster Sanaford and his only daughter Clarice.
The latter intends studying her art, which is
painting?, in foreign studios. She has been a pupil of
Mr. Julian Ashton, who is said to have prophesied
her arrival—in an artistic sense, of course. Amongst
the farewellers to the big liner was a young woman
suffering from the form of brain disease that
impels its victim to carry a teddy bear in public.
This form of mania was started by childless
Smart-Setters in New York. But as it was a
fashion that could be aped by anyone with a
dollar to spare for the stuffed toy, it was dropped
with great violence by the old nobility (who date
back to the middle of the nineteenth century) and
promptly picked up by fact’ry ’ands and female
persons who have to travel in trams. Under-twelve
looks quite congruous nursing a toy, animal or
otherwise; but when an able-bodied woman, well
into the twenties or thirties, goes through Pitt-
street (as did one lately) dragging a teddy bear by
a string, you think—“ Poor thing ! where’s her
keeper ? ”
There was a certain amount of genteel wailing
and teeth-gnashing at the Dangar wedding last
week, owing to the fact that the bridegroom de-
cided at the last moment, or thereabouts, not to
be married in uniform. He is 6ft. high, and a
likely figure of a man, and was expected to appear
in the perfectly gorgeous finery of the smart
cavalry regiment which he has abandoned in
favor of matrimony. A military hitching is
a rare event in this appallingly pacific
continent ; and the disappointment among
those who had an eye for color and glory was pro-
portionately the greater. The bride went away to
spend the inevitable honeymoon in the inevitable
Port Hacking cottage, loaned by the inevitable
Mr. Arthur Allen, wearing the very ultimate
shriek, or call, or cry, or hurrah in motor caps.
The new fashion is so utterly new that it looks
about half a century old. It is a cunning varia-
tion of the poke-bonnet worn by the type of dam-
sel who once affected archery and balmoral boots,
and it well-suited the demurely charming face of
the bride.
Mrs. Burdekin and Miss Aline Burdekin
fled Londonwards on the Malwa last week; so did
Captain Wilson. On the Asturias went the Con-
sett Stephens and family. Mr. Consett Stephen
has a ‘pretty wit of his own. I am told that at
the recent Union Club dinner, where three affluent
members leapt to their feet in succession with
offers of £lO,OOO apiece towards a Dreadnought,
Mr. Stephen remarked genially in the dead hush
that followed the tremendous performance, “So-
and-So” (an ultra-rich citizen) “is deaf.” Which
in all the circumstances was a brighter remark
than it looks in cold print. “ So-and-So ” stayed
deaf. He declined to follow the lavish example
that his fellow-members were setting?. The fact
was that he has his title already. It is a mournful
but strictly true circumstance, that in times of what
certain folks love to term “imperial peril ” the only
wealthy men who fight to the front and heave
their banking accounts madly into the arena are
those who are still plain Misters.
Mrs. Martin, relict of the late N.S.W. Chief-
Justice Martin, died at Clairvaux, Rose Bay, last
week. She was the eldest of the three heiress
daughters of old-time merchant William Long.
Each of the Long girls inherited on the father’s
death city property bringing in from £6OOO to
£7OOO a year. The Martin family has proba-
bly lived in more houses in its time than
any other in Sydney. Greycliff, where the
Wentworths now abide; Clarens, a big place
built by Mr. Martin; Woollahra House
(it is inhabited at present by the Walter
Halls); Tralee, on Bellevue Hill; and a dozen
others have seen their trunks arrive and fade away
again. Mrs. Martin worked hard and unobtru-
sively in the cause of charity in her heyday. The
’93 bank smashes smote her fortune a blow from
which it took long years to recover, and shortly
after that disastrous time she went to England to
economise and see to the education of her numerous
children. She had been ailing for some years
past.
Eldest daughter, “Muffie,” of High Court Judge
and Mrs. Barton, was married last Tuesday to
Mr. David Maughan, of the Equity Bar. The
whole affair was fully choral and ultra floral, and
the guests were numerous and their presents
costly—or else merely useful and inexpensive.
Lady Northcote (a ring), the Rawsons (a fitted
picnic-basket), Lord Richard Nevill (a silver box),
and the Tasmanian Exes. Strickland (a brooch)
were amongst the gift-givers not present.
There is much excitement abroad and many
anticipations and prognostications in the air
anent the will of the late Dr. John Hay. It
must be an involved sort of document. The estate
was burdened with over half a million pounds’
worth of bequests when it came into the doctor’s
hands. It is sure that he has piled some more
bequests on it. There is a romantic story that
long ago John Hay and a relative (now dead) com-
pacted that whoever succeeded to the property
should, on his death, will £40,000 out of it to the
other. The widow of the prospective beneficiary
has been married again, this time to a rich Eng-
lishman. She will get the share that was to have
been her husband’s. It is understood that the
Hay girls—and they are a fairly numerous band
—are to absorb £lO,OOO apiece. And there are a
host of other “ cuts ” to be made out of the big
and rich cake which lies in pieces about Berry and
Crow’s Nest.
Balladist Marie Narelle is again in Sydney
(she is getting race frocks), beaming with remem-
brance of a successful country tour, and not a bit
attenuated.
What an unfrocky play is “ The Englishman’s
Home.” Ola Jane Humphrey and the other girl
in it will have only one-gown chances. And they
aren’t gowns at all—they are just dresses. In fact,
they are clo’. It is dreadful to have to wear a
dress instead of a frock or a gown ! And there
isn’t any hugging in the piece. Think of it—a lot
of hossifers and soldiers about and no hugging,
and only a slate-blue tailor-made for the leading
Miss Brown. The play must indeed have some
deep political significance to compensate for such
lack of feminine garniture.
Talking of men of war : A girl friend of mine,
who is strong on putting a piece of paddock, a
pool, a bent tree and three cows on canvas in
water colors, has lately been at Bowral for that
purpose, and she sends me a postcard inked as
follows:
I saw the Australian soldier to advantage last Satur-
day. It was at Bowral, where the air is keen. A com-
pany of the Second had been out, and was getting home.
The men were in a hurry—they must have been, as I am
told they did over I£miles in 18 minutes. A fence (a real
solid three-railer) happened to be in the way at one point
of the journey. Some got through it, some vaulted it,
but one giant took it in his stride, and went clean over
it, rifle, accoutrements and all. And the rest took that
giant stride as a matter of course.
Melomaniac Raimund Pechotsch is back in Syd-
ney and looking like a prize pink chrysanthe-
mum after his four years of conducting and
examining at divers theatres and institutions in
London. He gives a concert on Good Friday
night at the Criterion Theatre.
“ We have no part in David, neither have we
inheritance in the house of Jesse; every man to
his tents, O Israel.” When the doors of the
Sydney Town Hall were shut in the faces of five
or six thousand people (the Hall being already
packed) on Thursday (All Fools’ Day), at the
mayoral and citizens’ welcome to Professor David,
I imagined the disappointed and enraged ones as
quoting from Holy Writ. But they didn’t quote and
quit. They stayed to pound on the doors. It was a
really first-class first-of-April joke that the Lord
Mayor played on the citizens when he said, “ Let
’em all come.” They all came, and, the hall not
being elastic, though many were called few were
chosen. Senator Walker was seen sprinting like
a 16-year-old from closed door to sealed door.
Then he departed to his tent, 0 Israel. Univer-
sity Chancellor Normand MacLaurin was hauled
into the hall through a basement window, and the
guest of the evening himself was engulphed in
the swaying mass for quite a while. A body of
able-bodied undergrade, some of the Town Hall
officials and certain police were sent out to track
him, and when they found him, the word strategy
doesn’t begin to describe the wiles and means
employed to bring him within the building.
Professor David is a splendid speaker. His
clear, resonant voice, though, was used on very
guarded matter, mostly humorous. Probably he
doesn’t wish to crack any of Shaekleton’s ice.
Pretty well all of what he said had already
appeared in the papers. He uses the University
slang now and then appropriately—“quintuple
whack of pemmican,” for instance—and
gives the impression of being 25 years
young, despite his greying hair. His confession
that the party did not have a bath for four months
will be joyfully received by the Domain dossers.
And the fine condition in which he has re-
turned is as an affidavit in support of his assertion
that the Antarctic region would prove a splendid
health resort. Mrs. David and a daughter or two
were proud listeners to their distinguished rela-
tive. The Mueller medal, presented by Mr.
J. H. Maiden on behalf of the Federated Scientific
Societies of Australasia, is a much-coveted honor
in bronze, and carries the young-old face of the
late Baron Ferdinand von Mueller.
The J. C. Williamsons—Mr., Mrs., and two
infants, with certain servitors —depart in a month’s
time for a two years’ pleasure trip to English
and foreign parts. J.O.W. made trunks full of
money last year, principally through “Mother
Goose” and “The Merry Widow.”
Mr. “Snowy” Baker, champion boxer, cham-
pion swimmer and champion diver, married Mrs.
Kearney, of Melbourne, last week. The lady’s
first husband was a champion tennis-player. Her
case affords one more proof of the ancient theory
that champion-marrying becomes a confirmed
habit if persisted in long enough. Daily paper
reports of the wedding mention that the widow
bride wore a Merry Widow hat. Courage !
Nothing startles me like the spectacle of 60
serious, middle-aged men rising as one shirt-front
to sing a humorous part song. I have never seen a
Judge solemnly adjourn his court ana do a graceful
gown dance (he couldn’t do a skirt dance, could
he?) on the barristers’ table; but I’m sure if
such a thing ever did happen that it wouldn’t
alarm me more than did the Sydney Liedertafel
last Wednesday night, when it thundered out
“ Only a Pin ” —which is the old. familiar rhyme
about the bad boy and the bent pin, and the man
who sat on it and rose again with the unseemly
velocity of a Czar going upwards on Dynamite
Day. From the far end of the Sydney Town Hall
the singers’ voices sounded like the enraged roars
of the punctured man, and the very small joke
was drowned in the immense volume of sound.
The serious middle-aged gentlemen—ever the
true sentimentalists —were more at home in
tender, regretful songs with lines like these :
Calm is the lake, the birds are sleeping,
Like whispers faint the breezes seem.
Whilst one number of the kind was in progress, a
far-off, soprano railway engine joined in nervously
for half a line, but collapsed in a penny balloon-
like wail, and trailed off into silence. “The Lost
Chord” chorus, with its majestic rhythm, was the
Liedertafel’s trump item. The utter solemnity of
it matched the utter solemnity of the middle-aged
gentlemen, and the seriousness of the audience—
who were the friends and relatives of the middle-
aged gentlemen. It scored an enthusiastic encore,
in which your Akenehi joined—to the complete
ruin of one pair of white kid, which were worth a
variable amount when new ; but they were almost
worn out, and I couldn’t have worn them much
longer, so it doesn’t matter, thank the Lord.
Besides, I have lost them in any case.
Mr. Louis Blitz played a double-bass solo, and
although it was very clever of him, it just sounded
like the soliloquy of a very large and very morbid
bumble bee. I always thought the double bass
was the foundation of all tunes; that it lived
down in the cellar of the melody, and never
hurried, but sat in the dark, and talked to itself
in a deep, rumbling voice, whilst the violins,
drums, flutes, and cornets danced in the drawing-
room overhead, and the piccolo twittered on the
roof. Mr. Blitz upset all my musical ideas by
hustling the gruff old fellow alone through a Hun-
garian Fantasy and an Adagio—performances
which suited his size and dignity not at all. Old
Double-Bass didn’t like it a bit, and, if he had
possessed legs, I’m sure he would have kicked the
artist’s shins as he was carried on. Personally I
consider it a waste to burn up artistic energy on
such music. An elephant might be forced to
make point lace; but it would be inferior lace,
and the wear and tear on the trainer’s temper
would be tremendous. Then, of course, there are
the feelings of the elephant to consider.
Arthur Crane gave a much-needed touch of
youth to the rather heavy function. The serious
gentlemen sang solemnly in a middle-aged way
about altars, and blessings, and forests; but
Arthur warbled D’Hardelot’s beautiful love-song,
“ Because,” and the house, including the serious,
solid gentlemen in the audience, rose and ap-
plauded him till he came back and sang again. I
am inclined to think that some at least of Crane’s
triumph was due to his not being middle-aged and
serious.
Yours affectionately,
AKENEHI.
One of the light-hearted jests of a
recent week was the plaint of a Lane
Cove (Sydney) alderman against people drown-
ing themselves in the beautiful river which
flows past his municipality. Five bodies
have been found in Lane Cove within the
last 12 months, and this tends to give the place a
bad name. The angered alderman pointed out
that some of these people didn’t even belong
to Lane Cove; they were strangers, who
came from afar and callously drowned
themselves at the front door of Sydney’s
prettiest suburb. He thought something
should be done, and he urged the Council to
“place the matter before the Minister.” Another
alderman thought it was time the Council
“ entered a protest.” Somehow it seems a rather
hopeless business. It is no use appealing to the
better feelings of the suicide after he is dead, and
before he is dead no one knows whom to appeal
to. Of course handbills might be distributed
bearing the legend “ Don’t drown yourself,” but
most people would regard that sort of thing as
approaching to insult. The difficulties seem in-
superable. Even the Minister can’t do much. It
isn’t a case that can be met by the floating of a
loan, and when a loan won’t meet the case it is a
pretty hopeless case.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, April 4, 1909.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Sydney is not telling us much of Jack London
and his wife (“Mate” they call each other) at
the present moment. It is four or five weeks
since the Sydney Yacht Club, by the hospitality
of Commodore Reeks, showed London what he
thought was a farewell glint of the Harbor,
“Mate’s so sudden,” said Mrs. London that day,
“that he’ll just sight that dandy boat of ours,
and we’ll be gone before I know what has struck
me.” They were indulging in qualms then for the
vessel’s safety. London felt so badly, about it that
he could only answer brusquely to the ever-
lasting question: “She’s all the time and a
half over-doo now.” Naval-Architect Reeks
in his electric launch ran the party up the Lane
Cove River. The Londons were enchanted at
the picturesque banks —fertile to the edge of the
water, with orchard and maize and luscious acres
of watermelon—“like the Mississippi in miniature.
They said the closed-in baths were a novelty.
“Look, Mate, how they put up picketing* to
keep out the sharks.” Coming into the narbor
again Mrs. London got into her element. Iho
captain gave her the wheel —keeping a watch at
her elbow. It was not necessary. She is a
keen water woman. The currents surprised the
lady nevertheless, and she bent to a strong and
amazed wrist force as she whipped round the
bends. “Just like dodging coral reefs, she
exulted in a shout, for the fresh southerly was
blowing her voice away. Mrs. London owned a
huge tortoiseshell comb for snooding her hair—a
comb that roused the envy of the other women
aboard. It curved nearly round her head, and
was large and wonderful. The marvellous
Japanese Boy had cut it. This Jap Boy is
so amazingly politeful that no one has
ever managed to make a dent in his
politeness. i\ lon soon s and such-like delicate
ocean attentions made things pretty rapid at times
aboard the yacht. Likewise they were sudden.
One night the chief engineer was pitched out of
his berth, and the Jap, three flights above, went
out simultaneously. He struck the engineer full
pelt—he was only awake then after a dead sleep.
“ Beg pardon, sir,” said the hurtling monkey ball
before he reached the deck.
Society in Sydney found the Londons “so
quaint.”” They asked them to dine, and
wore their latest Paris-patterned black rags
and their Directoire dresses and diamonds,
and London turned up in a sac suit and a
soft collar—comfortable and happy. The starched
men glared enviously at Bill Liverpool, while the
bare-shouldered women elevated their noses at
Missus’s high-necked Indian shantung. Mel-
bourne did not see the pair at all. London was a
sick man, and Mrs. London played nurse, ahe
novelist man speaks whimsically of the elongated
Albury station. He was very ill—the fever was
getting him down. All his luggage was checked
through, but his boy carried his typewriter. “I
always thought a typewriter a necessity of life
like a toothbrush or a whisky-flask, but that
station demanded that it be booked through
specially. They took my boy and my typewriter,
and I saw them disappearing down far vistas of
scenery—l thought I was delirious.”
“ Mai tie ” Moss, the big lazy-looking doctor-
man, has discovered a girl who will take the place
in his affections which his inseparable bull-dog has
occupied up to now. The bull-pup goes disconso-
late nowadays, for Dr. Moss is away honeymoon-
ing. That dog is a dethroned K 9. and his sceptre
has passed from him. He has struck a snag and
fallen into the sere and yellow dog, and his best
ace has been trumped. Miss Cox, a clever Gal-
lery student, was the displacing girl. She is now
Mrs. “ Maitie,” and lookers on are beginning to
understand the inner inwardness of the doctor s
sudden craze for Art. He became a Gallery
student, and wakened into wild enthusiasm, so as
to put his chair close up to the pinafore and easel
of his adored. The onslaught was effective, and
the nose of the dog is even more out of joint than
Nature intended. And even in its natural state
that dog was very bandy-legged about the nose.
Girls are gushing about a marvellous emerald
ring on Mab Kelly’s finger. Miss Kelly is the
hopeful of George, of the Bowes Kelly gang, and
the emerald is supposed to have engagement ten-
dencies. The finger of suspicion points at Russell
Grim wade.
The King of Sweden has presented Mrs. Janson
with the order of St. Vitus’Dance or some such
distinguished ribbon. The Swedish Consul acted
as King’s deputy, and handed over the bauble
among a gathering of exiled Vikings (and Vi-
queens) in Melbourne. Now Janson of the Voice
has departed in enchantment and a boat for her
native land to lay her thanks at His Majesty s
royal feet if she can get to them. But presum-
ably the royal presence is a rather unattainable
treat, even in Sweden, where there are no foreign
politics to keep his Nibs busy.
Returned gadders per the Omrah gush that in
addition to the fascinating Mr. Neaine (the star
aide of the Bosanquet entourage) there is another
cinch in likeable gentlem m-helps. Captain
Wright is bringing the necessary military ele-
ment. The Bosanquet household boasts twins,
same as the Dudley one, they being the whole of
the family. They are girls of the most approved
gentle English budlet pattern, and are in point of
age anywhere between 16 and 20. They are so
much alike that the ship got completely fuddled
and thought it was seeing double. A heavy
drinker aboard started to doctor himself for
D.T’s. in consequence of the twins.
Girls who travelled on the same outcoming boat
as the South Australian Bosanquets rave about a
new Gentleman Help who comes along. He is a
thing of beauty and a joy for evermore, and he
threatens to be a spoiled darling at high-class
frivols.
The two pretty Whiting girls are back in Mel-
bourne, but propose to stay only just long enough
to pack up mamma and some wedding garments,
and the moment they have buckled the last strap
they will speed back to England and matrimony.
They are not both to be married ; but one marriage
in a family sends all the girls in a wild whirl.
Claire, the sedate elder sister, makes Lieutenant
Herbert Haddon Chalmers her own in September.
He is a handsome six-footer, who has just been
promoted. His “job” is on H M.S. Hibernia
and he is understood to be a special protege of
Admiral Sir Archibald Berkeley Milne, who, of
all Admirals, is the most popular at the British
Court.
A rumor gains ground like a fire in a kerosene
store, that the recently-divorced son of a Star is
contemplating another plunge into the turbulent
seas of matrimony. The lady is rumored to be
the niece of the most successful hunter of lions in
Melbourne sassiety.
Melba, now in Tasmania, will rush her Maon-
land trip through before there is any risk of her
top note getting frost-bitten. She is due at Syd-
ney in June, and Melbourne again m September.
The Lilvdale concert eventuated last Monday,
the day before Melba’s departure from Vic., just
as the torchlight procession was becoming despon-
dent and the local oysters rather stale. Ihe
event reached a point of gorgeosity that no mere
city hall could approach. The whole small town-
ship was booked to its last wash trough to bed
down the visiting audience. It came from the
far corners of the fern gullies and over the^hills.
It wore its best dress “with the yoke out and
its manly dress suit that had grown to the fashion-
able plum color during the flight of many years.
The whole corporation met the train and pre-
sented the arrivals with programmes of gold and
silk.
“ Oona ” (to be correct) Bourne, the tall, pale
pianiste, went along to the Lilydale concert, and
has departed with the company for the round-
about trip.
It is a long time since the Opera House had the
holding power that Chung Ling Soo’s show
demands. Mrs. Chung is as clever as her hus-
band, but, with a curious assumption of the wis-
dom of the Chinawoman (or Chinalady), she takes
a back seat. She’s acute little Yankee, little and
round and almond-eyed. If there was only a
pale-gold tinting in her satin skin she would be
more than an imitation Chinese beauty—she would
be the real goods.
Will Moore’s four rather thin, shadow-like
playlets were produced in the Oddfellows Hall.
Halls belonging to Oddfellows and Rechabites
and Moabites and Jacobites and Mosquito-bites
and Dog-bites, and such orders, are weird places.
The insignia on the walls have fathomless and
carefully mysterious meanings ; and when puzzling
over them, one drifts into tortuous, uncharted
channels of thought like a nightmare.
A feature of the William Moore dramatic
evening was centred in the character of the
audience. At a Melba concert you see “all the
Best People,” but little Willie, the boy
dramatist, attracted a gathering of artists,
writers, and musicians rarely seen under
one roof at the one time. There were faces
well known but not often visible, and they pro-
duced an atmosphere of good fellowship that
speaks well for the heart of the average Bohemian
in this city of Philistines. This audience did not
come to scoff, and did not remain to pray. It
exuded a feeling of deliberate friendliness towards
a brother, and it did not matter the price of a
threepenny drink whether the plays were good,
bad, or indifferent. One fact, and one fact only,
was kept in view,—it was that one of themselves
was earnestly doing his best, and, therefore, the
little army of honest triers felt happy. Another
feature, and one that appealed strongly to a sus-
ceptible youth of my acquaintance, was the remark-
able number of pretty girls in the audience.
Truly, if these were all Bohemians, then Bohemia
must be all it is cracked up to be, and mixed
bathing on the Bohemian coast must be a pleasant
sport.
Local girl, when she wants her picture per-
petrated for her best boy, has a habit nowadays
of getting under the all-seeing eye of the camera
in full evening-dress. She hauls an uncomfort-
able dress-basket to the town studio, and brings a
fussy girl, companion to help “ do up the back
and to criticise the effect of the artificial flowers
in the specially-dressed thatch. It’s all frightfully
uncomfortable and unbecoming—the out-of-place
dress and the garish sunshine making havoc of a
so-so complexion or an elaborate make-up. The
anxiety and mental stress invariably “come
out” in the picture, and a tortured smile
is all the man behind the Photographic
Eye can evoke at the critical moment.
Attempts at photos, by electric light have
turned into beautiful things on rare occasion.
But now Melbourne beauty has only to drive to
Alice.Mills’ studio, on her way to the theatrical
First Night or to a ball; she can drop in on the
evening when she is looking her best in her new
frock—and a photo, can be snapped as quick as
lightning. Alice Mills, that most enterprising
Melbourne artist, has secured the first and only
instalment of a new light that upsets all previous
arrangements and calculations. The deed is per-
petrated in some infinitesimal fraction of a second
before the pose can be lost, and at the time when
evening dress is naturally worn, and when the
inmate of the clothes that are cut low feels real
in them, and not like an accident or a fraud or a
fancy dress show.
The Clutsam brothers, from Melbourne, are just
now very much in evidence in Fogland and there-
abouts. George Clutsam, author of “O, Ma
Babby,” and other coon songs that Ada Crossley
has popularised, was married the other week in
London to Herbert Flemming’s widow, Minna
Fischer. Brother Fred Clutsam, whose composi-
tions include “The Sea Hath Its Pearls, and
sundry ballads of saccharine sentiment, is likely to
make hundreds of thousands- —not to sa_y mil-
lions—with his pianoforte keyboard inven-
tion. It is a curved keyboard, arranged
with mathematical precision, and so ob-
viously an improvement on the old straight
array of keys that the originator sits amazed at
the thought of his having been the first to strike
the idea His patent rights must be immensely
valuable. London’s conservative m'lnubicturers
have adopted the invention, and lately the joyful
Fred went off to Berlin, taking with him a Broad-
wood instrument fitted with the curved kcy-
hoard, to demonstrate to the u tra-conservative
Deutsehers the hopelessness of fighting against the
novelty. By the way, the presence of Melba in
our midst is always an indirect reminder of
Fred Olutsam of the keyboard. He married
Miss Margaret Ullbrick, of Wilhamstown and
it was to her brother that Nellie Mitchell
her early troth, quite a while before she married
Mr. Armstrong. The “tiffs” that she and t i
Ullbrick sweetheart had before they finally broke
it off are remembered in the family like historic
thunderstorms. The future Melba was the aggress-
ive tiffier in every case. Finally the submissive
swain turned like the proverbial worm and
refused to be crushed any more, or else JNeliie
wearied of inflicting torture on one who showed so
little fight.
Australian dramatists begin to grow thickly.
Helen Lavis has a play “The Gods and the
Millionaire,” which sounds up to date, it is to
be produced by a syndicate in May or J une. xhe
writer vouches for it as being Australian m every
detail.
From “Bosna,” in Adelaide: —
We are being governed again. Admiral Bosanquet
arrived on Monday, and we flew every flag we had, and
put a red, white and blue sash round the Outer Harbor s
waist. The swearing-in was timed tor 3 o’clock ; but a
full hour before that the Town Hall part of King William-
street was entirely obliterated, and the only way to cross
the road was by balloon. In the Hall, officialdom, and its
wife, and its wife’s Merry Widow hat occupied all the
breathing space. We had the Army out for the occasion
—we’ve used it quite a deal lately—and the Mavy also
came out and made a guard of honor, just to show his
Ex. that we do know how to treat an admiral, though we
haven’t had one of our own for 50 years.
IE his Ex. wasn’t an admiral he would make a One,
high-minded “ old man ”in a melodrama— the sort that
gives the good advice, and is occasionally murdered by
the villain in the third act. He has beautiful white hair
and an expression of benevolent authority. Lady
Bosanquet is very tall and stately, and there are two
daughters, who don’t look bored, and who wear pretty
hats Lieutenant-Gov. Way, who has been looking after
South Aus. for the last few months, handed over the
door-kev of office to the new Governor, and two aides
carried it back to the Residence, and hung it on a nail in
the hall.
On Friday his Ex. had a lev6e, and received the bows of
one mile seven furlongs two perches of man.
His new Excellency began his strenuous career among us
bv opening the Register’s new building on Saturday morn-
iric. It’s a fine pile, with all the modern conveniences, and
is situated on the site of the old buildings in Grenfell-
street, of which thoroughfare it is a decorative feature.
Same afternoon the Kyffin Thomases, who have ow-ned,or
mostly owned, the Register since the beginning of South
Aus. (in fact, they owned it before there was aSouthOss.,
printing the first numbers in England), gave a gay little
inspection party. A big crowd wandered over the new
building and had afternoon tea.
Miss Waite and Miss Clara Kleinschmidt have reached
Britain’s Isle, and the melodious damsel is being taken
across Europe before buckling to hard graft.
Dr. Wigg’s elder and fine-looking daughter, Olive, has
given her young affections to Mr. Stanley Murray, who
has been away eating the requisite meals to make him a
barrister of the Inner Temple at Bullopolis. Mr. Murray
is well endowed with “splosh” of the realm, so appar-
ently he just wanted to be a barrister for fun.
The S. A. Society of Arts hanging committee is strenu-
ously at work, separating the sheep from the goats and
deciding how many puce sunsets may be hung without
interference from the police. If it’s awake, April 22 will
see the show open.
The concert of those back-homers, Jessie Redpath and
Gwen Chaplin, was a triumph in the matter of house. A
big crowd went to hear them, musical shows being a
raritv with us of late. And the thing was worth hearing,
for Eugene Alderman helm'd it with his heavenly fiddle,
and Murray Barlow helped it with his heavenly baritone
and the maidens themselves had a good deal to say, and
said it all right. Gwen Chaplin, always good, is better,
and her warbling was artistic. She is an Egptian-lookijig
maid, tall and graceful, with dark hair and a creamy skin.
The Bach Society sat in the audience and purred over
her, its first ewe-scholar. Miss Redpath has also im-
proved her melody in her travels.
The S.A.J.C. meeting at Morphettville, on the 27th,
wasn’t tremendously exciting. To begin with, the
weather was a delusion and a sneak. In the morning, it
threatened and drizzled ; and then, when everyone had
got thickly-coated and umbrellaed, the sun came out
fiercely, arid tempers and things were anyhow. The list
of “those present” wouldn’t have reached from here to
Melbourne either. Mrs. Arthur Rymill was abroad in a
graceful heliotrope raiment and a black picture hat, and
Mrs. Evan Kyffin Thomas had big blue roses in her mil-
linery and baby pink roses strewn over a silk frock.
There were a couple of Crozier damsels in tailor-mades,
but the brightest circumstance otherwise was the display
of geraniums in the driveway. Such gorgeous blooms
and such a varietv of them, and such a throng of colors !
I didn’t know Mature had so many shades in her paint-
box.
Tbe Lewis Cohens’ elder daughter, Mrs. Bridgland,
with her hubby and small son, are back in this part, and
back for good, so they tell a rejoicing multitude.* As
energetic Hannah Cohen, the lady had a busy finger in'
half a hundred social and charitable pies a year or so
ago ; and Adelaide, which does so like its sleep, could do
with a few more like her.
The Lyric Club is open again, not yet for musical pur-
poses, but to lunch the hungry and fulfil other important
functions of that kind. The call for new members brought
in a satisfactory response, and the institution faces pro-
speritv, as the fortune-vendors say. The new women’s
club is to be called the “Queen Adelaide.” I received a
mysterious document, the other day, telling me that I
should like to be an original member of it; but, as the
document was guiltless of names and addresses, I haven’t
discovered what happens next, or where.
Adelaide the other day shut down a throng of its
suburban hotels. It didn’t seem to have much method
in its madness either, and the consequence is that some
districts are prohibited from quenching their thirst,
while others have several pubheries in a row. Burnside,
for instance, has been deprived of its one and only hotel;
yet it is right at the foot of the hills, where the traveller
is often footsore and the picnicker very thirsty. Ancient
beer-marks have gone by the dozen. You can travel now
from Brighton to Adelaide, and pass but’ one drinking-
trough, where until a fortnight ago you passed five. The
first to go on that track was a veteran country inn at
Brighton, which, for half a century or so, had the jaw
bones of a huge whale to form the side-entrance.
Yours affectionately,
J OHANNA.
The well-known firm of Gowing Brothers,
George-street, Sydney, has done Australia a genuine
service in the way of encouraging the Australian to dress
in Australian-made clothing. It was the first firm to take
up and place on the market, in the shape of ready-made
and made-to-order suits, the pure all-woollen tweeds of
the country. Now that the use of Australian tweeds has
become general, and made much work and prosperity for
the country, Australians should remember the pioneer
firm which did so much to bring the desirable change
about. Style and cut are, like the materials, of the best.


Thou Shalt Not Neglect Thy Face.
AS CAN be seen by the accom-
panying illustration, my artist
has, for reasons of his own, put
Miss Ethel Irving on a pedestal.
I preferred not to inquire into
his reasons, deciding promptly that that
is Miss Irving’s rightful position. The
creator of the principal part in Mr.
Maughan’s delightful play, “ Lady Fred-
erick,” Miss Irving is, perhaps, the most
accomplished comedienne at present de-
lighting the theatre-goers of London.
When she was seen only in musical
comedy, her versatility and piquant
cleverness invariably raised her perform-
ance far above the level of lighter musical
work, and it was no surprise to her ad-
mirers that, when she essayed more legi-
timate work, she should have revealed
herself an actress of the most brilliant
gifts.
In her performance for the Stage
Society the critics were unanimous that
here was an actress of extraordinary re-
source and character, and the clever play
whose success had carried it from theatre
to theatre during its lengthened run could
scarcely have achieved such distinction,
had it not been for the. perfectly lovable
and convincing picture of Lady Frederick
drawn by this inimitable artiste. The
scene in which Lady Frederick’s lover is
initiated into the mysteries of complexion
“ veneering ” is a delicious caricature of
how the average Englishwoman practises
her daily beauty culture, and its pre-
sentation by Miss Irving must remain
a classic. But in private life Miss
Irving knows better. As she' delights
in showing her prowess in cross-country
sports—this illustration, representing
her on her favorite palfrey—so she
would abhor the idea of taking care of
her skin in any but the most natural and
sensible manner. In the letter here re-
produced she attests the merits of the
Valaze Toilet Preparations in most flatter-
ing terms. She pronounces them “ PER-
FECTLY WONDERFUL FOR THE
SKIN.” And many of her sisters in the
profession share her opinion, as witness
MISS ELLALINE TERRISS, who says
she finds “Valaze a most valuable pre-
paration, and will most certainly recom-
mend it.” MISS MARIE STUD-
HOLME states, “ That in her opinion
the Valaze preparations are quite the best
of the kind she has ever used.” MISS
RUTH VINCENT states “That she
has found Valaze a very agreeable and
valuable preparation, and can strongly re-
commend it. ” MISS CECILIA LOFTUS
writes, “I find the Valaze Skin Food
most excellent, and shall be pleased
to recommend it to my friends.” MISS
ALICE CRAWFORD declares, “ That
Valaze does precisely what the skin
requires: it preserves its tone, white-
ness, and clearness, as no other prepara-
tion has done.” MISS ELIZABETH
FIRTH pronounces 1 “ Valaze a most
valuable preparation.” MISS FANNY
V'ARD says that she is “delighted
with the Valaze preparations.” MISS
MARIE DAINTON again says, “ That
she has found nothing better than
Madame Rubinstein’s Valaze.” MISS
PAULINE CHASE says: “I have
used Valaze, and consider it very
pleasant and very good,” and others
have said equally flattering things about
them. These facts should be given the
greatest possible consideration by the
average woman, for the reason that
there are none quicker to realise than
a deal of fascination exercised by the
stage.
Realising these hard truths of life, I
have set before me the task of making
such provisions as will enable clients
living at a distance to be their own
“ Beauty Specialists ” in the privacy of
their own homes. For this reason I have

stage folk that, while talent is a great
thing, and mental equipment and true
artistic temperament are most valuable
possessions, physical attractiveness finds
them wanting when weighed against
them in the balance. And this is even
more applicable to the society woman or
the more retiring housewife moving
amidst surroundings where all the
glamor is lacking—that is responsible for
gathered together on the Continent from
sources of highest scientific value a series
of preparations for home treatment, and
intended to meet a geat variety of re-
quirements. Amongst these preparations
is one which will, within a fortnight to a
month from its first application, clear
away the film that unnaturally blurs so
many complexions. This is the Skin
Food and Beau tiller, Yalaze. In Yalaze,
Nature and Science have done their par
in making it the ideal Skin Corrective,
Preserver and Beautifier. It is, indeed,
Nature’s own replenisher of skin nourish-
ment, conveyed simply and gently with
the finger-tips.
Because, owing to the active principle
contained in Yalaze, the skin is made to
breathe right, to look right, to be right,
it may justly be said that Valaze stands
for freedom from wrinkles, tell-tale lines,
drab appearance, freckles, sallowness,
and roughness of skin. The price of
Valaze Skin Pood is 3s. 6d. and 6s. 6d. a
jar.
The following are the prices of some of
the other specialties supplied by me :
NOVENA POIJDRE, a “fat ” powder,
for dry and normal skins. This powder
is the only preparation of its kind known
which is a skin food as well ; VALAZE
POWDER, for greasy skins. Both
powders are supplied at the price of 25.,
3s. and ss. a box. VALAZE COM-
PLEXION SOAP, which I import, con-
taining as it does a considerable percent-
age of the ingredients of Valaze Skin
Food, carries into the skin the glow of
health, and gives it the transparency
and satiny “feel”so suggestive of Valaze
Skin Food. A cake of this soap lasts from
four to six months with ordinary usage.
Price 2s. a cake. VALAZE BLACK-
HEAD AND OPEN PORE CURE
banishes every trace of this disfigure-
ment and refines the skin’s texture,
2s. 6d. a jar. Valaze Liquidine dispels
undue redness of nose and face, and pre-
vents blackheads and pimples by acting
directly on the pores, and freeing them
of waste matter, grease, and dirt, which
clog them, so that the breathing of the
skin remains unimpeded, and the circula-
tion is improved. Valaze Liquidine pre-
vents also the skin being shiny and over-
moist ; Bs. 6d. a bottle. " VALAZE LIP
LUSTRE, for dull, blanched lips ; biting
and wetting will not displace the coloring
it imparts ; 3s. and 2s. VALAZE
SNOW LOTION is a liquid powder of
rare distinction. Only the woman who
has struggled in vain to subdue a shiny
or oily skin in the heat of the Australian
climate will appreciate the full meaning
of the statement that the Valaze Snow
Lotion not only refreshes, cools, and
whitens the skin, but also enables it to
retain that dull ivory finish which adds
so much charm to the faces of Continental
Belles. It is supplied in three tints,
white, pink, and cream, at 3s. 6d. a bottle.
I have endeavored in my book, “ Beauty
in the Making,” to familiarise the reader
with the purposes which the above speci-
alties and others that I import from my
home-town, Vienna, and from Russia, are
intended to serve. I wish that every
woman would write to me for the book,
which I will send free on application,
enclosing 3d. for postage. “ Beauty in
the Making” has been written with the
principal object in view to making the
care of the complexion an easy and
pleasant task, an intelligent and practical
occupation. In all my aims I have been
guided by the cardinal thought that, how-
ever neglected may be the complexion,
however ill-used the skin, there should be
means, as there are qualifications, to bring
relief and work improvement. It always
gives me pleasure to reply to any inquiry
concerning matters of the complexion, and
following the wise and time-honored prac-
tice taught in the famous Schools of
Beauty Cult in Vienna, I devote as much
attention to the work of the preservation
of the complexion as to its restoration.

SWIFT PUNS
RENDERED THIS MAN A
HELPLESS CRIPPLE.
Had to be Carried About: Mor-
phia to Ease the Pains: Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills
Cured the Cause.
A touch of sciatica, makes the whole system
quiver with pain. The sharp, shooting pains are
like red-hot needles in the hips and legs. Doctors
call sciatica, “neuralgia of the sciatic nerve.”
That’s the complaint in a nutshell. The nerves
have become starved, the system run down —then
sciatica or neuralgia.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills cured sciatica in the
case of Mr. George 1 Ellis, farmer, of Longford,
Tasmania, who was so crippled with the complaint
for six years that he was unable to do any work.
They cure by curing the cause; by making rich,
new blood, which is the food for weak, run-down
nerves, and when the nerves are toned, sciatica
goes. Poultices and liniments are useless. Mr.
Ellis made the following statement to a reporter.
“Some years ago I was laid up with sciatica
and had to give up my work. The pains I
endured were something awful. I could only
hobble about the house on walking sticks. I sent
for the doctor and he blistered me from the hips
to the feet. It gave me relief from the pain, but
did not cure me. I soon got bad again, and felt
pains like red-hot needles in my legs. I drove to
see the doctor and it took four men to lift me out
of the cart and help me into the doctor’s. He
injected morphia to kill the pain, and gave me
medicine, but it did not cure me. I was suffering
for about six years when I read in a pamphlet of
the wonderful cures of sciatica by Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, and I sent to the chemist for two
boxes. After taking one box I got relief, and after
eight boxes I was cured and have not been
troubled since, and am quite satisfied with the
wonderful cure by Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. I
am glad to give this testimonial for the benefit of
other sufferers.”
The price is 2s. 9d. per box, 6 boxes 15s. 3d.,
and if you have trouble in getting them, send a
postal note for the amount to the Dr. Williams
Medicine Co. of Australasia Ltd., Sydney, and
they will be sent post free by return mail.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Murray, of Victoria, and Wade, of N.S.W.,
both started as opponents of the idea of present-
irig Britain with a big battleship. Murray caved
first; newspaper clamor got him down and chewed
h;is ear inside 24 hours. Wade was stronger and
hij3 ear more durable,, but he also caved in the
end ;. but Wade had at. least the excuse that he
had Murray' clamoring' at' him as, well as the
papers, and that his head at last began to buzz so
badly, ,that he was hardly a responsible citizen.
The pair will get little credit, however, for their
action. It was so obviohs.ly a yielding to pressure
that their vessel will be popularly known as the
Draggedout.
j Joseph Cook, in reeling offa mere catalogue
of.platitudes re Prime .Minister Fisher’s policy,
on a recent night, revived a very dead and almost
decomposed remark. He objected to. a Labor
Goverjiriient being in power, as it did not repre-
sent a majority of the community. Heaven
knows how many times Joseph has made that
objection,' yet to, the best of his, power —to the
extent of one vote —that same Joseph helped to put
the Labor party into,office. Therefore, what does
he mean bv objecting to,a thing,he;helped to con-
summate? Even he ought to have some reverence
for his vote. A poor thing it may be—but it’s
his, own, ,7 : 1
A SHOCK.
Wealthy citizens have offered to give large amounts towards providing Britain with a Dreadnought.— Item.
AUSTRALIA (to stout patriot): "Seeing that you've corue to the conclusion that Britain's hands are full in the matter of defence, what about
putting something in the hat towards a navy for defending Australia? ”
11l though he is, and close as the end
appears to be, Premier Price (S. Aus.) exercised
his prerogative by choosing his old friend and
Labor colleague, Kirkpatrick, as Agent-General
without reference to any of the other Ministers.
He also exercised an uninfluenced choice in select-
ing Wallis, Secretary of the Trades and Labor
Council, as the new Chief Secretary.
Melbourne Harbor Trust has invited fur-
ther public disrespect by voting increases of
salaries to the best-paid of its administrative
officers, after issuing an order that deckhands
and firemen employed on the Trust’s floating
1 plant shall take turn and turn about in spending
Saturday afternoons and Sundays aboard the
dredges and things, and doing watchmen’s duty,
without getting any compensation, for the loss of
holiday. The secretary’s salary has gone up £5O
—from £625 ,to £675 ; the treasurer’s £425 is
. raised to £450, and a total of £260 a year is to be
distributed in. annual increases among other mem-
bers of the “ office ” staff. And all the plain
dredging man gets is a watchman’s job without
pay.
The Price Cabinet (in S.A.) lasted three
years and eight .months before a single member of
the original crowd dropped out, and it lasted
three years arid five months before there was any-
thing in the shape of a reconstruction (through
the addition of two new Ministers). This is a
record for S. A., but not for the Commonwealth*
In Tasmania, Premier Smith ran a Ministry for
three years arid 5| months without even one mem-
ber portfolio with another ; and Pre-
mier Neil Lewis did the same sort of thing in the
same State for three years and six months. In
;S. A. the Price Ministry now ranks third for dura-
bility. Only the Kingston and Jenkins Cabinets
I put up a longer record.
Bowden, or Bow-wow, or whatever he
should be called, the very ordinary Foreign-trade
person who represents Lithgow (N.S.W.), where
the ironworks are, has declared himself in favor
of increasing the naval subsidy to £5.00,000 a year.
Bowden regards the building of an Australian
navy—the iron and steel work for which would
make the Lithgow iron industry flourish like a
green bay tree—as quite a secondary matter. It
is-a-pity .these advocates of a naval subsidy don’t
explain themselves more definitely. The British
people pay about 15s. per head per annum for
naval defence, and reckon it barely sufficient for
security. Bowmen proposes that Australia should
show its resolution to do the square thing by pay-
ing 2s. 6d. per head. Now, does Bowden reckon
that it is enough for Australia to have one-
sixth as good a defence as Britain requires ?
Or does he reckon on getting as good a defence as
Britain has, and swindling the Ma Country out of
five-sixths of the cost of it ?
The men who export the wheat, as dis-
tinguished from those who have to load the ships,
are already clamoring for an increase in the size of
the Chapman corn sack. The exporters say they
want a bag that will hold 2001 b., and maintain
that the authorised affair will only hold 1751 b.
Unfortunately for them, Customs Minister Tudor
is a practical person, and he personally attended
the stacking of wheat one day when in Adelaide.
Three bags he saw weighed went 2031 b., 2011 b.
and 1991 b., while a general average went 1971 b.
This small difference wouldn’t justify fresh legis-
lation, and the exporters fix a baleful eye on th<3
Minister who insists on seeing things, and won’t
take anybody’s lies or assurances as gospel.
There are a lot of the ways of the average
State Parliament about that amateur imitation
thereof—the Victorian A.N. A. Conference. The
other day, after spending hours jabbering over
the Deadhorse proposal—which it finally approved
by 106 votes to 101 —it deliberated till 4 a.m. over
a dozen vastly more important matters, and threw
most of the lot out. Among the rejects was one
that urged the Government to construct railways
to the natural ports—from the Mallee and Western
Victoria to Portland, for instance. This motion
was rejected “on the voices”. Yet, if the
Natives could but think, Australia is throwing
away the price of a Dreadnought every year
through not following that policy from the
beginning.
Joseph Cook, after due consideration of
Prime Minister Fisher’s policy-speech, announced
that “he regarded the proposals relating to com-
pulsory military training as conscription.” Well;
it is hard to see how anybody can prevent Cook
regarding anything as something or other if he
doesn’t know any better., Nobody is responsible
for Cook’s ignorance save Cook himself'. But
why should Cook feel bad about it? Australia
has already had compulsory approval of the Boer
war when, thanks to the party of which Cook is
such a despicable feature, men were sacked, as-
saulted, battered, insulted, and boycotted because
they wouldn’t declare against their consciences
that they believed in something that they didn’t
believe in. And now, at public meetings in Mel-
bourne, the Cook party is endeavoring, by assault
and abuse and ruffianism, to enforce compulsory
approval of the idea of presenting a Dreadnought
to Britain. These proceedings are a lot less
decent and orderly than the compulsory mili-
tary training that Cook talks about.
Frank Johnson, Mayor of Adelaide, took
advantage of the fact that the new Governor of
S. Aus. is an Admiral—the first since Admiral
Hindmarsh, who proclaimed the “ Province ” on
December 28th, 1836—t0 do some unexpected
straight-talking at the swearing-in of the new-
comer :
We dare to believe that the hysterical atmosphere that
pervades Australia in some quarters is not justified, and
that there is no reason at all why England cannot pro-
vide all the battleships necessary for her protection and
ours. (Hear, hear.) But there is reason to hope that
out of all this will rise a great national spirit of generous
giving, that the wealthy in our communities will give
freely of the great riches which have come to so many
Australians, and that in no niggard manner will the
national coffers be enriched to enable Australia either to
double he) 1 subsidy to the British Government or make
good beginnings for a navy of her own. (Applause.)
And Governor Bosanquet, having enlarged on
Australia’s wealth and good points in general,
echoed with :
It is a glorious heritage to leave to your posterity. Let
us take care that together with that heritage we also
leave the means of defending it. (Loud applause.)
In fact, no British naval man ever does open his
mouth concerning Australia’s duty, except to
insist that Australia’s duty, both to itself and the
empire, is to see to its own defence.
Somebody has been remarking in Mel-
bourne that the local Political Labor League

and Pony Racing Society, patrons of Wren’s

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mry Cook : Let him remind them, in asking that ques-
tion, of one or two things that were being done for them.
in l the first place, Great Britain had given then) a Torrens’
Wetothis continent. _ While they had been,developing
it she had placed at their disposal that mighty fleet which
had kept watch and ward while they slspt in safety, ,and
worked for their living. (Cheers.) In the development
of .their estate they .had developed an ocean-borne trade of
between £120,000,000 and £130,000,000 per annum, every
pound of which was convoyed by Great Britain, no matter
where its destination might be. (Cheers.) And when
that destination was to a foreig'n. customer in preference
to a British one, even then . Great Britain sent her fleet
wittv that,produce, going to foreign shores as it did. She
provided for them to-day all the Consular services of the
Empire without the payment of a brass farthing.

officials usually scour the country for “ talent” during
April, but this year they have remained in town to speak
furtively and seductively in the ear of the competent
’bailer who toils in a shop or on a lorry, and who used
aforetime to play a-Wednesday afternoons. The Wednes-
day half-holiday disappears on May 1, and the Wednesday
Football League and Association will go with it; where-
fore the big League clubs are anticipating extra-large
“gates” and weighty bank-bags. But if some of the
offers alleged to have been made to ex-Wednesday stars
are genuine, then the hinges and the latch and a good
deal of the timber of those “gates"are already mort-
gaged. _
A SLUGGISH LIVER
Made Operative by the Use op Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills.
Mr. John Butler, of 211 Kent Street, Sydney,
having suffered from a sluggish liver, and fre-
quently from indigestion and constipation, tells of
the wonderful and permanent effects obtained by
using Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills, which cor-
rect the liver but do not gripe, and restore the
bowels to a normal and healthy condition, thus
overcoming constipation naturally and per-
manently.
“Having used Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills
as a corrective for a slug-
gish liver,” he states,
“and occasionally for
indigestion, I can assure
you that there is no better
remedy. I was in the
habit of taking Epsom
Salts, and from time to
time I tried other medi-
cines, but none have
proved so effectual or per-
manent in their results as
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root
Pills. They do not gripe
-—like other physics,
which usually open the
bowels once and leave you just as constipated
again the following day. Your pills restore the
bowels to a normal and healthy condition, with-
out causing pain, or weakening the system.”
Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills are a searching
remedy. They reach the liver a,s no other medi-
cine does. They put a move in your bowels,
strength into the kidneys, and life into your liver,
bracing up the nerves and muscles, toning up the
stomach, stimulating the circulation, and impart-
ing health and energy through the medium of a
well-regulated system.
Mr. John Butler.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The explosion of the N.S.W. Rugfiy Teague
made a noisy and picturesque beginning for football ttiis
season. The mob which mismanaged the League’s
affairs seemed to regard anything in the shape of re-
bellion as impossible. It had always maintained a ruth-
less attitude to ’bailers who even looked sideways at it,
and to question an act of the management was to be
fired out of football for ever, for the Union had also shut
tlie gates of mercy. So the Leaguers groaned under a
tyranny, compared to which that of the Tsar was kindly
and paternal despotism. Then, in one night, the revolu-
tion happened. It was well managed, and pushed to the
bitter end. The revolutionaries made a clean sweep,
and wiped out the old committee lock, stock and barrel.
Threats of withdrawing bank guarantees were flung
about recklessly, but the rebels took no heed and
went on with the butchery. The old management
had been shocking—so utterly ruinous that any change
was for the better; but, all the same, demoralisation
reigned throughout the clubs. The Union had a
splendid opportunity to kill the Northern Union game
in Australasia by declaring a general amnesty for all who
came in within tile week. Such a proclamation would have
brought the flower of the League trooping in. But,
though some of the officials proposed such a course, the
council was afraid. It knew that to bring back the
Leaguers would have roused the ire of its own rank and
file. The reason is not hard to see. There is no room for
the flower of the League except by displacing in the first-
grade matches a lot of the flower of the Union, at which
the flower of the Union would have kicked like blazes, to
use the language of flowery metaphor. Sydney has more
first-class footballers than the clubs have use for, so the
League was left to grow corns on its feet toiling up the
steep road,of reorganisation.
Having got control of the Teague, the revolu-
tionaries set to work to stem the panic. Expecting every
moment to be struck dead by the Union with an amnesty
proclamation, they toiled feverishly to restore confidence.
And as the days passed and the Union bomb did not fall,
the League began to pull itself and the clubs together.
At the first meeting of the new council every club sent
representatives loaded up with enthusiasm, and, what
was better, some money. The sub-committees were all
appointed and the selection crowd elected pro tern., pend-
ing the return of the “ Kangaroos.” The delegates re-
ported that the clubs were not demoralised, and that
practice outings were being arranged, and had in some
cases already started. With careful management and a
good spectacular display during the coming season, the
League should be powerful in numbers and cash at the
end of six months. But practically the whole future
depends upon making an attractive programme for the
coming season. With a player like the incomparable
Messenger, the League has a powerful draw ; but one
brilliant player alone will not make a success of a season.
The main tiling is to get club members to train hard
and practise the finer points of the business, so that
every game shall be full of excitement, and the finishes
close and sensational. If the council can arrange these
matters it will pull the League out of the mud, without a
doubt.

On Saturday last four first-grade football clubs
were in the field in and around the N.S.W. metropolis.
Western Suburbs met and defeated Eastern Suburbs at
Ashfield Oval by 13 points to six; and South Sydney downed
Newtown by nine points to eight at old Rosebery Park
racecourse/ The competition commences on April 24,
when Balmain will meet South Sydney and Eastern
Suburbs will struggle with Glebe ; also, North Sydney
will geo to holts with Newcastle, and Newtown will
grapple with Western Suburbs. On Wednesday night,
unless something went wrong with the Vorks between
the writing of this and the publication thereof, the
League held a “rally” and smoke concert at the Pro-
testant Hall, where the future policy was outlined and a
definite statement made as to the disposal of the surplus
funds—when any. That is a subject in which every
player takes a keen interest.
The Union clubs were also abroad on Satur-
day, when Glebe walloped Balmain by eight to nil, and
St. George got the father of a hiding from Newtown, the
figures being 14 and zero. Western Suburbs smashed the
University with eight to six. Manly—much improved
and very cocky—dealt it out to North Sydney to the tune
of 13 to'six, and Sydney playfully rubbed Eastern Suburbs
in the dust by eight to three.

The governing body of N. S. Wales Soccer
football closed the entries for the various competitions
last Monday. Judging by the entry, the game is going
ahead even in the stronghold of Rugby, and this year it
will advance to the dignity of inter-State matches, for a
Westralian team will raid the N. S. Wales grounds. There
is also talk of a Maoriland team dropping in, and if it does
the game should get a considerable lift,. By the way, the
Soccer game is spreading rapidly in Europ ■, and people
who take to heart the old Iron Duke’s statement about
the battles of England being won on the school play-
ground will be alarmed to hear that the Germans halve
taken it up. So have the Dutch and Belgians. What
between Germany building Dreadnoughts and playing
Soccer, Britain’s position is becoming precarious.

The fellows who have taken on the Dunlop
Military Despatch Relay Cycle Ride from Adelaide to
Sydney are in for anything but a picnic. Barring the
zest of being shot at, they will have all the thrills and
hardships of a military evolution. The riders are carrying
a military despatch, and, for the time being, are on active
service. The time-table has been worked out for fair-
weather conditions, but there is room for many varieties
of weather between Adelaide and Sydney. The couriers
will require to be at their posts long before the schedule
time, as some of the relays may get blown along by a
stern wind and beat the time-table. And woe betide the
courier who is not on hand to .receive fronTthe fainting
paw of the man who has broken the record the
little red morocco satchel which holds “the papers.”
On the other hand, some of the couriers will
strike a head wind, perhaps laden with sleet, rain,
and pitchforks points downward. But they are
expected to battle through somehow ; and while they are
battling the fellows on the next relay will be doing a
perish and using slanguage. Should either rider punc-
ture, or get run over by a mad automobilist (they say
there are some of them running wild just now), the other
must gr ib the satchel, and leaving his companion to
perish, scoot for his very life. The despatch is the only
thing that matters. If both machines on a relay go bung,
the section has to be finished by any other mode of con-
veyance, Shanks’ pony to be utilised in the last resource.
The despatch must be gut through. Men whose times
happenafters.3op.nl. should see to it that their lamps
are burning well, and abundantly supplied with oil. Tne
honor of actually carrying the saichel will be decided by
mutual arrangement, or failing any arrangement, tossing
a coin. Under no conditions must relay riders decide the
question by stoush.

A year ago the Automobile Club of Victoria, in
order to encourage unattached motorists to join, sus-
pended for 12 months the nomination fee for new
members. At the annual meeting the committee looked
round on the horde of men who had been raked in
thereby; then it decided that the suspension was good
policy, and moved that it be continued for another year.
The idea was carried unanimously. Hardly any thing else
could happen, come-to think of it. Then Mr. Wagstafif
moved that the annual subscription for town and country
members be increased by 50 per cent. Rejected with en-
thusiasm. Then Brother Wagstaff upended himself and
spoke words of wisdom. He wanted the members to
decide right there what sort of a club they wanted.
If it was to be an automobile club pure and
simple, the present sub. was sufficient. But if
they wanted a social club, with drinks, smokes, and
frills laid on, then the dollars must be put up.
Personally, he favored the idea of being a motoring
club only. But, very properly, he wanted the question
definitely settled, so that there should be no tnisunder-
ing about it; and the members cheered him, and decided
that they were motorists, not butterflies. People who
wanted to run a social affair could join a social club ; they
were there to mote—and mote they would. The question
of raising the subscription is to stand over till the com-
mittee resolves what is required in the way of a garage
and other strictly motoring essentials, and then re-
ports to a special meeting of the members, and they will
decide on ways and means. Anyhow, the Automobile
Club of Victoria is going to be a live concern for men,
not a collection of old he-ladies gossiping over afternoon
tea.

Talking of motor-cars reminds that it has just
leaked out that the German War Office is having con-
structed quite a number of ears for transport purposes.
All the same they are to be fitted with quick-firing artil-
lery, just in case someone tries to rush the troops while
they are being transported. The chances are that when
the motor-car butts into warfare it will be used for a lot
more than transporting troops from one place to another.
Fitted with bullet-proof armor and carrying machine artil-
lery, it will be used to cover retreats, make raids, and
push home attacks on positions which the defenders have
not had time to properly fortify. Properly handled, a
military motor-car, driven with 30,000 or 40,000 horse-
power, would become.a veritable land Dreadnought. The
cars being constructed by the German War Office are not
quite on this scale ; but they are pretty huge, as can be
guessed from the fact that the cost of building one runs
to £20,000.
The final rounds of first- and second-grade
cricket in Sydney came to an end on Saturday last, with
Glebe at the top of the first, and Mosman premier of the
second division. Glebe scored 20 competition points and
won easily, as Waverley, the runner-up, had only 14.
Paddington, the third on the list, had 11 ; Central Cum-
berland, nine ; University, six ; Petersham, four ; North
Sydney, two; and Midd e Harbor, one. Below that five
ciubs were something less than nothing each ; but, let
the veil be drawn. In the second grade the contest was
much closer. Mosman (top dog) won out with 22, and
Glebe ran second with 19. Paddington and Newtown
were together with 11, and Waverley and University
breasted the bar together with nine to their respective
credits. North Sydney and Leichhardt ran in double
harness with five each ; Central Cumberland made four ;
and below that was below zero.
The closing day of first grade was brightened up
by a couple of centuries, and an exhibition of the hat
trick by T. J. Proud, of Gordon, at the expense of Pad-
dington. But it did not block the swing of the pendulum,
and Paddington won by 72 runs on the first innings. The
century makers were —McMullen, of Burwood, who piled
up 108 before Pite bowled him ; and H. Cranney, of Cen-
tral Cumberland, who scored 133 before he was caught by
Brownlow off Bull. J. Minnett, of North Sydney, felled
three Waverley wickets for 20 runs. Kerim, the Syrian,
of Redfern, took two University wickets for 13 runs ;
Proud, who did the hat trick, took eight sticks for 82
runs ; Grant, of Sydney, dropped six of Burwood’s for 94 ;
Avres, of Central Cumberland, took five of the seven
Middle Harbor wickets that fell for 58.
One interesting feature of the season was that
Glebe went right through it without losing a solitary
match.

C. A. Smith, a rattling English cricketer of yore,
and a popular London actor nowadays, has been saying
foolish things about Australian wickets to a Baily’s Maga-
zink interviewer. More than 20 years have happened since
Smith visited this country —it was the .year when two
English teams came and killed one another’s financial
prospects —and in the meantime the cricket pitches have
been reconstituted. But Smith apparently takes it for
granted that his experience in the ’Bo’s was the experi-
ence of all the cricketers who came after him. He says :
“ The grounds at Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide are
top-dressed with mud from the Harbor , and after heavy
rain this mud can be pulled up as if it were blocks of
Turkish delight. Charlie Turner used to get a ball
almost at right angles on such a pitch.” These old-
fashioned criticisms of alleged new-fashioned conditions
make one sceptical as to the demoniac quality of the
long-ago bowling in comparison with the work of modern
artists. In Australia and in England even the worst
wickets are better than they were when Charles Aubrey
Smith played the game, and Charles Turner used to get
a ball almost at right angles. Perhaps the worst wickets
now are better than the best ones of Smith’s day.

Victoria now boasts 18 clubs in its Ladies’ Golf
Union, with a total membership of nearly 1000.
S. A. lawn tennis championships brought out
nobody but the local men to oppose Parker, the spec-
tacled Maorilander from Sydney. The Victorian inter-
state six had been on hand, but had to go back home.
The preliminary rounds showed t e veteran Bowen still
the best Adelaide man, and Parker polished him off
easily, thus getting a second leg in for the E. T. Smith
Cup. However, Bowen and Roy Taylor won the Doubles
just as easily from Parker and Quill (also of Maoriland).
Miss Addison, of Melbourne, beat all the local ladies, and
then assisted Bowen to win the Mixed championship.
After a few weeks of anarchy resulting from
the bursting of the Maoriland Sports Federation, order
has been restored in the Tremulous Isles. The Associa-
tions of Auckland, Canterbury, Wellington, Otago and
Southland have created a fresh Association of their own,
wh ch Association will consist of two delegates from each
affiliated Association. These delegates must be amateurs
according to the Association’s own definition—there is a
great deal of “ Association ”in this par. The home of
the new governing body will be in Wellington. A com-
mittee of one from each affiliated society will pick the team
to compete in the Australasian Championships meeting at
Brisbane in August.

Sailing is now' dead in Sydney, and cricket died
on Saturday, but bowls and tennis linger still. In fact in
this climate bowls and tennis are perennial, and the
trundler never really ceases from trundling nor the
volleying tennis smasher from smashing. The most
cheerful feature of the sporting world at present is the
disappearance of the long, dreary columns of type-headed
“ Review of the Season ” from the sporting papers—that
long mass of printed wretchedness in which prosy writers
told drearily why forgotten races were lost, and how it
was that dead and gone matches ended the way they did.
Now a saner generation sums up the past season in a few
inches, and dwells only on the bright outstanding features
of the particular pastime. Sport is like the dinner of
yesterday—a thing to be enjoyed thoroughly while it is
on, but not to be dragged to light when it should be
decently digested.
The “private billiard party” is the coming
dissipation in Sydney, and during the impending winter
the correct caper will undoubtedly be to mvae jour
friends to “ have a billiards evening: with me. Hitheito
this most charming- game has, excepting at P«Wic tables,
been the perquisite of the wealthy only. Billiard tables
cost a fearsome amount of money, and are quite beyona
the reach of people of average means. The establishment
of Billiards Ltd. at 630, 632, and 634 George-street Syd-
ney, has changed all this. A pleasant evening with the
cue is now within the reach of most people. At the
palatial establishment above mentioned are a number of
private rooms, each fitted with standard Alcock tables,
where parties of ladies and gentlemen may indulge
in the most delightful of indoor games without in any
sense frequenting a public saloon. Private parties have
a separate entrance, the rooms are above the public
halls, and light refreshments are supplied by the
management; so that all the requirements for a pleasant
evening are now on tap at from 3s. to ss. per hour.
People^who imagine they are composed of the stuff of
which champions are made can obtain private tuition from
that master of the game, Mr. Harry Gray, and, if he con-
tinues to be rushed the way he is at present, he will have
to look round for a competent assistant. The private
rooms can be booked in advance and all arrangements
made, so that, when the party eventuates, everything
will work with clock-like precision. Until Billiards Ltd.
happened along, the only dissipation with which a man
could indulge his friends of both sexes was to take
them to a stuffy dining-room and there clog them up
with food and drink. Now he has at hand the means of
giving them a really pleasant evening and topping off
properly with a light supper. Therefore the billiardist
looks forward to the coming winter with pleasure.

There was a stir in the world of bowls last week
when a Tasmanian team fell on Sydney in quest of the
Wood-Macleod trophy, and got beaten in three matches
by 343 points to 224 (109-80, 126- 63,108—81). The Tas-
manians played well enough to deserve better luck ; but
it was a case of a team containing a few
good men tackling a place which simply reeks
with crack players who let everything slide when
bowls are concerned. The play of the Sydney crowd
was superb 1 but when the writer thinks of the time
that must have been devoted to realising that state of
perfection, it makes him weep. The Victorians will be
across this week in search of the same bauble ; and three
of the N.S.W. team which downed the Tassies will make
way for heavier guns to do battle against the men from
Murray’s State. These latter are regarded as dangerous.
The trophy is at present in the hands of N. S. Wales, and
the VValers are determined it shall stay there.
* * * *
Victorian bowling champion of champions this
season is J. H. Sheedy, who easily defeated the runner-
up, H. Burton, in the final by 31 points to 14. Sheedy
has at sometime or other won all the big bowling honors
in Victoria, and is competing with Tommy Bent for the
title of Victoria’s first and best-known athlete.

A section of the Sydney press has been render-
ing the sea brinier than Nature made it with salt tears of
sorrow which were spilled under the delusion that Lipton,
grocer and friend of Ned VII., had donated a yachting
cup to Melbourne and none to the capital of Ma. The
grievance, like many another from the same quarter, is
bogus. Mother has not been wronged. The Sydney
R. Y.S. had filled its programme for the season when the
Lipton offer of a cup came to hand. Of course, the club
grabbed the piece of hardware with impetuosity and cries
of joy, but it doesn’t intend to race for it till next year.

A big round hole was punched in the Victorian
Anti-Gambling Act in the Essendon (Melb.) court last
week. A bookmaker was charged with having accepted
a bet from a woman at the Moonee Valley racecourse,
“contrary to the provisions of the Act.” The bookie’s
lawyer successfully contended that the Act referred only
to “approved” bookmakers, and as his client was
strongly disapproved of, the prosecution must fail. It
failed accordingly. From which it appears that women
are free to gamble as much as they like on Victorian
racecourses, provided they bet only with welshers.

“ A. 8.” : Published obituaries of the late Joe
Thompson leave a hiatus between his alleged landing at
Port Melbourne in a barrel, and his appearance as a book-
maker. Joe first became a public character in the capa-
city of chucker-out at . Bill Devonshire’s Hotel, at the
Ararat (Vic.) rush, where the emoluments of office
amounted to only 30s. a week. It is not recorded that
Joe, like his brother Jack, ever fought in the ring, but he
was a wonderful man in a rough and tumble, and would
clear the bar in 3min. 4sec. Devonshire swore, to the
day of his death, that the world’s greatest chucker-out
was lost when Joe Thompson became king of the
ring. In those days, wherever the diggers were on
good gold, Joe Thompson would be found, and
when Ararat became a mere poor man’s field, he
joined forces with the late Austin Saqui and started
dancing saloon at Rutherglen. Saqui was a remarkably
fine pianist and supplied the music, while Joe looked
after the preservation of order. The police swore that
the saloon was a model to the whole of Victoria. When
Rutherglen declined, Joe and Saqui returned to Mel-
bourne, and made a more or less precarious living
“ following racing” in all its forms. Nothing came amiss
to Joe. The dice, the sweep, even the three cards he
manipulated with an expert hand. But he had two out-
standing viitues in his role of gambler—he was rigidly
punctilious in keeping faith with the public, and
was always on excellent terms with the police. The
result was that the average raucous spieler had one chance,
and one only, to scale and insult the public. The' next
time, the punter would transfer his custom to Joe, and,
getting a fair deal, would return to him every time. And
the police, finding Thompson always reason ble, would
lumber his sarcastic and over-blanky rival, and smile with
a tolerant eye on the coming leviathan when he blon-
dinned on the edge of the very lenient gaming laws of
the day. Joe owed his rise to the visit of the first English
eleven. He followed them all over Australia, betting
on the game, running various gaming amuse-
ments which would make modern' wowserisni
throw hand-springs, and raking in the cash at every
turn. When the team reached Beech worth, Joe was
already fairly solid, but he finished the day there with a
big, red handkerchief bulging full of sovereigns. Even the
sensation he caused in later years by paying out £20,000 in
Bourke-street, was smaller in its way than the one he
created in Beechworth that evening. His fame spread,
and, as nothing succeeds like success, the other towns
were ready to welcome the celebrity bnly one degree less
enthusiastically than the cricketers themselves. At
Albury Joe took a room in one of the biggest hotels, and
promptly started a hazard school, which progressed
merrily until, after three hours, the police burst
in. Joe merely smiled. Ever courteous to the
Law, he protested that it was hard lines
that a few gentlemen couldn’t meet together for
a friendly game ; then he put away his dice and asked the
sergeant to have a drink. To modern Melbourne Joe is in
danger of being forg-otten, or, what is wors •, exalted
into"asolar myth, but in the late ’seventies he was revered,
even as John Wren and Adolphus Bent, combined in one
exquisite personality. In the eyes of the writer, who was
then tolerably young, he never loomed so great as his
brother Jack, who was a bona fide prize lighter, and had
walloped Sheol out of Christie in a historic battle.
Were it not for Christie (now a revenue detective) getting
periodically photographed in various disguises for the
Melbourne weeklies, people would forget that there was
ever such a man as Jack Thompson, and so there is a
chance that Joe’s memory will go the way of his little
brother’s. Still Joe has left an enduring monument to
his greatness in “Don Juan House,” which stands in
Albert-street, East Melbourne, near to, but infinitely
better known than, St. Patrick’s Cathedral.

Adelaide Cup and Goodwood Handicap, to be
run in the first week in May, have each placed about 50
horses in the handicapper’s hands. The top six in the
Cup are—True Scot (9st. 71b.), Knox (9st, 41b.), then Des-
tinist, Banzai, Waipuna, and Scintillation. These last
two have Bst. 101 b., and look rather well in. For the
shorter race, True Scot (fist. 101 b.) gives Knox a pound,
with Banzai, The Castaway, Tiercel, and Miss Bobby
following ; but Sun of a Gun (atBst. Sib.) is most fancied
in such ante-post betting as still illegally lingers in Ade-
laide.

Seems that Haokenschmidt and Gotch cannot
come together on the mat in Australia during Melbourne
Cup week. But no matter when they meet, they can be
sure of a bumper house. Hackey was very popular when
he was in Australia before, and the wild and woolly
accounts of Gotch’s behavior in the struggle in America
have invested him with something of the interest that
the crowd takes in the circus alligator that has eaten six
trainers.

America is now filled with weird tales of how
Johnson gave Burns the “ double cross.” To people who
watched Burns’s whole-hearted training, and know
that his over-anxiety led to his going stale, this yarn is
humorous. Someone may have tried to square Johnson,
but certain it is that Burns was there to win by straight-
out fighting—if he could.
The Westralian sporting scribe known as
“ Stiffy,” hecause he tipped a horse to win a big race a
week after it had died, has a double in Melbourne. The
hurdle racer Nagoya broke his neck at Caulfield recently,
while being schooled over the hurdles. Two days after-
wards a Melbourne weekly confidently recommended the
defunct meat as “a good thing” for a forthcoming
hurdle race. Whereat disgusted punters complained
and said disrespectful things.

At least one “muddied oaf” has decided on a sen-
sible change. Jim Matthews, who skippered the Y.M.O.A.
(Sydney) Australian Rules football team to victory last
season, told his old team, the other night, of his decision
to go into the more serious duty of becoming a “ de-
fender” of the country during his spare time, in lieu of
kicking the inflated leather. This is Matthews’ good and
sensible advice : “ It is the duty of every man to think of
his country first; and, much as I love football, I feel lam
doing right by declining to play so that I can give soldier-
ing my undivided attention.” There is more sense in
Matthews’ resolve than in the wild Dreadnought frenzy.

Wellington (M.L.) Referees’ Association is a
live concern. Last season there were 416 appointments
for Rugby Union matches, and only a few fixtures fell
through owing to the absence of the appointed official.
The association is in a good financial position, and ex-
pects to put last year’s big record in the shade during
the coming season.

Tommy Burns is breaking out in a new place.
On Good Friday eve he will exhibit in Melbourne a series

Mr. Gr. NIELL,
commercial tra-
veller, writing
from Hotel Met-
ropole, Sydney,
Feb. 20th, 1909,
says : “Your
‘PEERO’ Pills
are a grand nerve
and appetite
maker. I swear by
them. Theyarein-
valuableformen.”
Australia is noted for the prevalence of serious stomach and liver diseases, caused
by the continuous use of heavy meat foods, and carelessness of diet and eating.
The most serious diseases spring from stomach neglect, leading to expensive
operations. The timely use of “PEERO” Pills corrects and strengthens the
stomach, makes new blood, gives nerve force, and keeps the liver healthy, curing
the most chronic cases of constipation rapidly. It is the advance agent of Health
and should be in every home. “PEERO” Pills preserve and prolong life'

AN ATHLETE’S TESTIMONY.—MR. W. BARKER,
of King- Street, Newtown, writes:—“l was a
sufferer for years from Constipation so serious that
I loolvod upon myself as dead. I could never enjoy
a meal. I took ‘ PEERO ’ Pills for four weeks, and
they have made me a new man. Your pills are, in
my opinion, the best for constipation known.”
MRS. W. RUSSELL, Victoria Street, Darling,
hurst, says “ I was known as the walking: grhost
of Darlingrhui st, I was so pale and bloodless. I
had anaemia for years, which threatened decline.
Your pills are for women worth their weieht in

JAUNDICE.
cieutly numerous, the patient *is often very low-spirited and quite
depressed.
As it is mentioned, in connection with Diabetes, one of the most
dreaded occurrences, during the course of the disease, is the onset
of ditibetic coma. In the same way, in obstinate and long-continued
cases of jaundice, a peculiar condition known as cholsemia (ko-lee-
mee-ah) is apt to develop. This derives its name fi;om one Greek
word, chole, signifying bile; and from another, haimu, meaning the
blood. By the term is meant a sort of bile intoxication, in which
the most characteristic symptoms are convulsions and delirium —
ending, perhaps, in fatal coma or unconsciousness
A better idea of the manner in which jaundice is caused w'ill be
gained by referring to the articles on the Gall Bladder, and Gall
Stones, respectively. As it will be found, the disorder often arises by
reason of some obstacle, which prevents the onward flow of the bile.
The small bowel, as it leaves the stomach, for the first 9 or 10 inches
of its length is called the duodenum (du-o-de'num) It is so named
from the Latin, duodeni y , twelve, because it is about ecitial, in length,
to the breadth of twelve fingers. As shown in the second of the draw-
ings, under the headiug of Gall Bladder, it is into the duodenum that
the common bile duct empties itself.
From this it will be seen that any obstruction of the common bile
duct, such as a gall stone, .or any inflammatory swelling in the duo-
denum, which includes the orifice of the same duct, will effectually
prevent any bile from flowing into the small bowel Thus we may
have gall-stone jaundice, or jaundice which is due to inflammation
of the duodenum. This latter form of jaundice is quite frequently
met with, and is termed catarrhal jaundice—that is, jaundice which
is brought on by a catarrhal (or inflammatory ) condition of the
duodenum.
But there are other forms of jaundice in which there is no
obstruction to the onward, free flow of the bile These non-obstruc-
tive varieties sometimes occur in certain fevers, in some cases of
snake bite; or, at times, in poisoning by phosphorus, arsenic, or
certain minerals. Jaundice of this non-obstructivc kind is some-
times produced by severe anxiety, fright, mental emotion, or nervous
shock. In these non-obstructive cases, the motions are generally of
a more natural colour; the pulse, instead of being slow, may be rapid;
and the skin does not itch.
A patient with deep jaundice should be kept m bed. In the
slighter cases, perhaps, it may not be so necessary. The first thing
to do is to apply a poultice of half mustard and half flour over the
region of the liver. The situation'of the organ is indicated in the
article on the Abdomen. The poultice, in question, should be of
the same dimensions as that recommended in connection with sub-
JAUNDICE.
3
acute biliousness —See Biliousness. -As there advised, it is to be kept
on for 20 minutes or half an hour, till the skin over the liver is
thoroughly reddened. Afterwards, it should be followed up by hot
fomentations. The itching which is often so intolerable in jaundice
is frequently relieved by sponging the body .with hot water, contain-
ing a little bicarbonate of soda. This is perhaps better recognised
under its more familiar name of Baking Soda. But if this be not
successful, some of the remedies mentioned under Itching of the Skin
should be substituted.
Fluid nourishment is, as a rule, all that can be allowed. The
most likely to be beneficial is a combination of half hot milk and
half hot water. To each breakfastcupful (which is usually considered
equal to 16 tablespponfuls, by-measuring glass), as much bicarbonate
of soda as will lie, heaped up, on a “ threepenny bit,” should be added.
When thus taken warm, it soothes the inflamed lining of the stomach
and bowels, subdues any acidity, dissolves the thick mucus, and pro-
motes a freer flow of the bile. But, if the patient craves for anything,
in addition, he may he allowed peptonised milk, or thin arrowroot.
Very'weak mutton broth or beef tea, and milk in combination with
lime water or Seltzer (not seltzogene) water, are also permissible.
Sometimes there is such a loathing against food that great difficulty
is experienced in getting the patient to take anything at all. Accord-
ingly, thin jellies, junket, and similar appetising articles may have to
be called into requisition.
At the very beginning, 3 grains of calomel may be given at,bed-
time. This should be followed, next morning, by one or two tea-
spoonfuls of Carlsbad salts in a tumblerful of hot water. Strong
purgatives should not be employed, as they will not prove to be of
benefit. But should there be any constipation, the pills as in, {Pill,
No. 1) will be very useful. They should be succeeded, next day,
by a small dose of Carlsbad salts.
'For catarrhal jaundice, there is probably no single remedy equal
to phosphate of soda. Its administration is usually attended with the
most remarkable success. The dose is a teaspoonful level, not
heaped up—and preferably given in hot water, three times daily, or
oftener if necessary. For children who are to this form of
jaundice, a fourth or third part of the dose will be sufficient.
But when the jaundice does not soon yield to this treatment, the
following prescription should be tried: —Five grains of iodide cf
ammonium; 2 drops of Fowler’s solution of arsenic; 20 drops of tinc-
ture of calumba; and one tablespoonful of water. This draught
should be taken in twice as much water, thrice daily, before meal
times. In case it does not succeed, small doses of ipecacuanha, one-
quarter of a grain, three times a. day, may be substituted. In ex-
tremely obstinate forms of jaundice, a compress as recommended in

ACME OF PERFECTION.
AS a SKIN FOOD. SHAVING SOAP and
TOILET PREPARATION, KUGEL-
MANN’S PURE HERBAL SKIN
SOAP is fast achieving a position before
all others as the Soap for special treatment for the
complexion and skin, as well as for medical,
hygienic, shaving and general toilet purposes.
The main reason for this unique assumption of
public favor is that KUGELMANN’S HERBAL
SKIN SOAP is not merely an article of ordinary
commercial manufacture, but is carefully pre-
pared under the direction and from the prescrip-
tion of Australia’s Leading Consulting Herbal
Practitioner, so as to really constitute a part of
his treatment. In short, two great principles
form the solid base of this Herbal Soap :
1. That ABSOLUTE PURITY is essential in
any article of constant application to that delicate,
vital organ, the Skin.
2. That soap affords one of the readiest mediums
for the medical treatment of the human body.
The HERBAL SKIN SOAP in its present
form represents the fruit of nearly forty years’
experience in the use and prescription of beneficent
herbs for the cure of Australian maladies, and,
therefore, is better adapted to the climatic and
other conditions of Australian life than any
imported soap.
For the Prevention of Redness and Skin Irrita-
tion of all kinds, the cure of Eczema, Tetter,
Ringworm, Shingles, Blotches, Pimples and
Freckles; the prevention and cure of Dandruff,
fostering a stimulating effect upon the growth of
the Hair, stopping falling-out, inducing growth,
and making it soft and glossy. As a dentifrice, it
arrests decay and produces a dazzling brilliance.
For Shaving, is of Unique Benefit, owing to its
production of a rich, lasting and creamy lather, and
the exercise of soothing and hygienic functions
upon the skin.
In the nursery its beneficent effects upon the
tender skin of infancy obviates the use of powder,
etc., the child’s skin being always kept cool and
smooth by its use.
“ Beauty’s Aid ” is the well-earned title of this
Herbal Skin Soap, because, in a healthy and per-
manent manner, it enhances natural beauties as
no mere nostrum can ever hope to do. In every
department of the toilet, and for every medicinal
or hygienic purpose for which soap can be used,
this soap has proved superior to any other soap.
The Greatness of the Herbal Skin Soap is the
greatness of Nature. It is a rare combination of
natural organic remedies culled from the grand,
•and simple provision of Mother Earth, whose
vegeta-ble kingdom contains in abundance the only
medicines suited for assimilation by mankind.
The great appreciation of Kugelmann’s pure
Herbal Skin Soap is indicated by the following
selection of testimonials , which are portion of those
we are daily receiving from every part of Australia:

Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co., 199 Clarence St., Sydney.
Gentlemen, —I have made a careful analysis of a sample
of “ Kugelmann’s Pure Herbal Skin Soap,” which I find
to be composed of vegetable oils and fats, saponified with
pure alkali. It contains no free alkali, nor any substance
deleterious to the most delicate skin. The perfume and
color are both of natural and harmless plant origin,
neither having any trace of animal or poisonous
materials. Having powerful but non-poisonous anti-
septics thoroughly incorporated in the process of manu-
facture, this soap possesses healing properties which will
remove diseases of the skin and restore it to a healthy
condition. It is a beautifully finished article, comparing
favorably with similar imported soaps, and if used regu-
larly as an adjunct of the toilet, it will assist in keeping
the body in health, and will have a pleasing, s railing
effect on the skin.—Yours faithfully, F. H. MOLES-
WORTH, F.C.S., F.G.S., M.S.C.I. London, Analyst.
BALDNESS CURED.
43 Peel Street, West Melbourne,
June 13, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
Wholesale Druggists,
14-16 Queen-street. Melbourne.
Dear Sirs.—About four years ago. when I first
had vour Herbal Skin Soap brought under mv
notice, I was almost totally bald ; in fact, I had
no hair at all on the top of my head. I had tried
all kinds of so-called “ Hair Restorers,” but they
did me absolutely no good whatever ; in fact, I
was losing even the little bit of hair I still had.
About June, 1902, when I was employed at the
“ Opera House ” by the great Australian Entre-
preneur, Mr. Harry Rickards, a friend, as a great
favor, gave me a box of vour Herbal Skin Soap.
I used to wash my head with it, and after a
while I noticed that mv hair had stopped falling
out. Up to this time I did not attribute the stop-
page to using your Soap, but at last I could not
think of anything else that was stopping my hair
from falling, so I started to rub the lather well
into my head every day. I used to rub it well
in every day for about half an hour, and at last I
noticed a thick down appearing all over my head,
which had been as “ bald as a badger ” before, and
in a little while my hair was as thick as ever, and
has remained so ever since. I may also state that
my wife finds your Herbal Skin Soap unequalled
for the Complexion, while I can say the same for
it for Shaving. I will always be pleased to give
any further information re your marvellous Herbal
Skin Soap to any enquirer, as I cannot speak too
highly of it. (Signed) HARRY AIREY.

FALLING HAIR CURED.
Glebe Point, Svdney,
29tli May, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
Clarence-street, Sydney.
Gentlemen, —I am pleased in being able to in-
form you that your celebrated Herbal Skin Soap
is by far the best soap on the market for the Skin
and Hair. My hair was falling out terribly last
summer, and I was advised to try a good soap,
which I did ; in fact, I tried several so-called
“ good ” soaps, but was greatly disappointed to
find that they did not have the slightest effect on
my hair, and it still continued to fall, until one
day I noticed your Herbal Skin Soap advertise-
ment in the Sydney Bulletin', and resolved to
give it a fair trial, I procured a box, and was so
pleased with the result that I sent for another
box, and now my hair has ceased falling alto-
gether. It is beginning to grow quite thick and
glossy, thanks to your celebrated Herbal Skin
Soap.
I shall always have much pleasure in recom-
mending it to my friends, as it is an excellent
Soap for both the Hair and the Skin, and the per-
fume is simply delightful.
(Signed) (Miss) DAISY JONES.
FOR GLOSSY HAIR AND BABY’S SKIN.
Gray Street, Brisbane, Q.,
24th April, 1902.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.
Dear Sirs, —I find your Herbal Skin Soap ex-
cellent for my hair. I know of no Soap to equal
it; it makes my hair soft and glossy. I also use
■your Soap for washing my baby, as it keeps his
skin free from soreness, and quite smooth and
cool. When I use your Soap for the baby, no
powder is necessary.—l remain, Sir, yours
obediently.

14-16 Queen Street, Melbourne, Victoria.
Gentlemen, —As the result of a fairly long ex-
perience of your Herbal Skin Soap, I can speak
most enthusiastically, and without any reserva-
tion, as to its merits, not only as a delightful
toilet preparation, but also for its great medicinal
virtues, and the feeling of solid comfort which
follows its use.
Previously to making its acquaintance, I had
been much troubled for years with Dandruff and
Scalp Irritation, accompanied by dryness and
falling of the Hair, for which I had used many
advertised preparations without any remedial
effects. A vigorous Shampoo with your Herbal
Skin Soap, however, had such a unique and
pleasant stimulating effect that I persisted in its
use, with the result that my hair is entirely free
from Dandruff, has altogether ceased falling out,
and is greatly improved in appearance.
As a Shaving Soap I consider Kugelmann’s
Herbal Skin Soap unapproachable, as it has abso-
lutely no hardening or irritating effect upon the
skin, but, on the contrary, maintains a rich,
creamy lather, which ' makes the operation of
shaving a delightful one, and leaves the skin in a
smooth and pliable condition.
My wife speaks in the highest terms of the
Herbal Skin Soap as a Nursery and Toilet Pre-
paration, and could not, in fact, be persuaded to
use any other than yours ; and from the numerous
friends to whom I have recommended it at various
times there has been only one expression of
opinion concerning your great preparation, and
that has been the very highest.
(Signed) P. E. NORWOOD.
SHAVING WITHOUT USUAL SORENESS.
21 Carlisle Street, Leichhardt, N.S.W.,
15th September, 1906.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
199 Clarence Street, Sydney.
Dear Sirs. —I also wish to compliment you on
your excellent Herbal Skin Soap. For years I
have suffered with soreness after shaving. Then
I heard of your soap, and have used it for the past
two years ; during that time I have never once
had any soreness. I can highly recommend it to
anyone, especially those who have a tender skin.
If you think others may benefit by these lines,
you are at liberty to use them as you think fit.
Again thanking you.
(Signed) GEO. W. PARDONNE.
AN AUTHORITY ON SOAP AVOWS IT’S
DELIGHTFUL.
Ipswich, Queensland,
7th August, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
Melbourne, Victoria.
Dear Sirs,—l am a Soap Manufacturer, and
can. therefore, speak with some authority on the
subject of soap. Your Herbal Skin Soap is the
best that, so far, has come under my notice, and I
have seen and used pretty nearly every soap that
comes on the market. Not only has Kugelmann’s
Herbal Skin Soap a delightful odor, but it has a
softening effect upon the skin, and quickly heals
up abrasions and sores.
(Signed) HY. TIVOLI HOOPER.
TENDER SKINS OF CHILDREN.
O’Connell Street, West End,
Brisbane, Q., 26th April, 1902.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.
Dear Sirs, —I write to let you know that my
wife considers your Herbal Skin Soap to be the
best obtainable. She has found it particularly
good for the slcin, and especially suitable for the
tender skin of children. I myself use it for shav-
ing, and find it prevents all roughness and sore-
ness.—Yours very truly,
(Signed) WALTER J. ADEY.

A LOVELY COMPLEXION.
92 Shafton Road, Kangaroo Point,
Brisbane, 17th February, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Go.,
14-16 Queen Street, Melbourne.
Dear Sir, —I like Kugelmann’s Herbal Skin
Soap owing to its keeping my complexion free
from blemishes, freckles and sunburn. If I get
sunburned in the course of the day, I find your
Herbal Skin Soap will take it quite away by
morning. If I run out of your soap, my com-
plexion soon begins to look blotchy and dip-
colored. I can soon get it right again, though,
by using plenty of your Skin Soap.
(Signed) BEATRICE BROWN.
SOFTENS THE SKIN, CURES PRICKLY
HEAT.
Lavinia House, Upper Roma Street,
Brisbane, Q., 24th April, 1902.
Messrs. H. E. Kugklmann & Co.
Dear Sirs, —Perhaps you will be pleased to
learn that I consider your Herbal Skin Soap far
away the hest that I have ever used. It is the
only soap I ever tried that had any really per-
manent softening effect upon the skin. Last
summer I suffered occasionally from prickly heat,
but I quickly cured this irritating complaint
whenever it showed itself by washing with a
thick lather of your Herbal Skin Soap.—Yours
sincerely,
(Signed) L. ROBINSON.
Witness : J. Williams.
EXCEPTIONAL CURATIVE PROPERTIES.
Ipswich, Queensland,
7th August, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kggelmann & Co.,
14-16 Queen Street, Melbourne, Victoria.
Sirs, —Of all the Soaps I have tried, I find your
Herbal Skin Soap easily first. Not only is it
pleasant to the skin as a toilet soap, but it has
also exceptional curative properties. To wash
with Kugelmann’s Herbal Skin Soap is like using
an ointment, for the lather cures all breaks of the
skin, pimples, etc., with which it comes in con-
tact.
(Signed) SAM PIPER,

Ipswich, Queensland.
CURATIVE IN BARCOO AND SKIN
DISEASE.
Mount Ormond Tin Mines, near Irvinebank,
North Queensland, 4th July, 1907.
Messrs. H. E. Kugelmann & Co.,
I have given a thorough trial to your Herbal
Skin Soap, which, from my experience of its use,
I consider superior to other soaps used in con-
nection with surgical operations. It is also a
fragrant and most effective Toilet Soap.
I may inform you that I gave some to a lady
friend of mine, who was suffering from Prickly
Heat. She informed me that the first application
soothed the unpleasant irritation, and that, after
using it two or three times, the inflammation
entirely disappeared.
I have also used it for something from which wp
suffer out here in the “Never Never ” country,
where vegetables are scarce and practically un-
obtainable, and which bushmen know as the
“ Barcoo Rot” —an angry irritant sore, that
spreads over the surface of the skin when it
receives a scratch or a slight wound, and declines
to heal for some time, even under the influence of
Carbolic Ointment and a course of Blood-Purify-
ing Mixture. In this connection I have found the
Herbal Skin Soap marvellous in its healing and
soothing qualities. I have also used it as a wash
for dressing festered wounds, for which purpose it
has shown marked curative medical healing proper-
ties, and is undoubtedly a boon to the public. I con-
sider that for Eczema or other diseases of the Skin
it is without an equal, and that when its virtues
become known and appreciated by the public it is
likely to oust the imported Skin Soaps from the
Australian market.
Your Herbal Skin Soap cleanses the Skin, frees
its pores from impurities, and guards it from the
dangers of disease. It frees the Skin, also, from
Blotches, Pimples, Sunburns and Blemishes, etc.
I can honestly recommend it to mothers when
bathing their little ones, as it allays all irritation
and strengthens the Skin. (Signed) MATTHEW
BUTLER, J.P., Mining Engineer, Mount Or-
monde Tin Mine, N. Queensland.

Make a Good Start with a Brownie
The Camera that gives Results!
Many an expert photographer started with a Brownie and
became so enthusiastic with the results obtained that the hobby
became the study of a lifetime. And really the little Brownie
is such a magnificent camera —so simple and serviceable that it
does give one a grand insight into the mysteries of camera
craft. The expense is slight, the effect great, and as the popular
films are used you donh have to trouble about the dark-room.
The Brownie, you know, is manufactured by the Eastman Co.,
who make the famous Kodak, and it is indeed u almost a
Kodak." Come in and see them, or write for full details. The
Brownies will stand the most critical examination.

splendid photograph, even when used by child-
ren. It is simple to operate, and when provided

good-sized bust photograph.

with a fine quality imitation leather. The
pictures measure 2jin. x 3£in., and it has a
capacity of six exposures. The lens is a 4£in.

HOW TO EXPAND THE SPAR OF LIFE!
AVOID CONSTIPATION.
B Y neglecting irregularity of the bowels the victim is inflicting on himself or herself untold
agony for the future. Permanent relief from this baneful disorder is easily obtained
by using Kutnow’s Powder. And why ? Because Kutnow’s Powder is Nature’s own
remedy/ in which are incorporated certain health-giving properties of the most famous
European spas. It acts gently, speedily and efficiently. Try it at once.
Mrs. L. MARTIN writes:
“ Cornfield, Lavagh, Ballymote, Co. Sligo,
“30th March, 1908.
“Gentlemen, —I got a bottle of Kutnow’s Powder lately for a boy
of ten, who suffered from biliousness. He is wonderfully improved since
taking your Powder ; his health is now quite good. You may make what
use you like of my letter, as it may be the means of curing others.
“Faithfully yours,
“Mrs. L. MARTIN.”
How to Guard Against Fraud!
There is only one genuine Kutnow’s Powder. All conscientious
Chemists supply it throughout the World. Be careful to avoid spurious
substitutes which often cause irreparable injury to health. See that the
fac-simile signature. ft S. KutllOW & Co., Ld.,” and the registered
trade mark, “ Siir .nsprung Or Deer Leap/’ are on the carton and
bottle. You now know
How to Get Genuine Kutncw’s Powder.
THE ONLY WAY
When you have obtained a bottle of Kutnow’s Powder, take a
dessertspoonful next morning before breakfast. Put the Powder in a
tumbler of water, which may be cold, tepid, or hot, allow it to effervesce,
and drink slowly. About 10 to 15 minutes later take a hot cup of tea to
hasten its action. After Kutnow’s Powder has acted, note the immediate
beneficial effect. You will find that you feel ever so much better, ready
for hard work, brighter and clearer in mind. It will make you eat well,
work well, and sleep well.
W. ROUGHAN, Esq., writes:
“ 106 High Street, Southampton,
“28th April, 1908.
“ Dear Sirs, —I beg to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of a
bottle of your celebrated Kutnow's Powder. I may say, even by so small
a quantity, I have derived much benefit therefrom, thus testifying to its
excellent qualities.
“Yours faithfully,
“ W. ROUGHAN.”

BANANA LAND.
Walkers Limited, of Maryborough, com-
pleted one desirable century the other day, when
it turned out its hundredth locomotive made for
the Bananaland Government.
S. P. Fraser, chairman of the Aramac(Q.)
Shire Council, is claiming the Bananaland local
government record. He has been in the council
for 23 years, and was recently elected chair-
man for the 20th time. Except when he was on a
six months’ trip to the Cold Country, he has missed
only two meetings in all his long career, and he
could find every gutter in the district in his sleep.
Vincent Creagh, who for one brief Parlia-
ment—-the one which Chelmsford dissolved to
oblige his friend Philp—sat for Croydon in the
Buianaland Assembly, now runs a pub in Bris-
bane. While Creagh was member for Croydon he
got, married, and his wedding-cake was built by a
Chow. This led to his subsequent defeat by
W. S. Murphy, one of the seven who shook the
dust of Kidston off their feet when that politician
made his famous coalition with Philp.
Geraldton gets a little rain now and
then. In the last 17 years there have been two
months when over 60in. of rain fell ; in nine
months there were over 40in. of rain ; and 22
times in the 17 years over 30in. of rain fell in a
month. The wettest year of the period (1894)
had 211 in. (over 17£ft.) of rain, and the driest
year (1902) had 70m. (nearly 2yds. of moisture).
Four times in 17 years did Geraldton have a dry
month, but it never had two consecutive dry
months.
Apparently the attempt made a while ago
to form a co. in Sydney to introduce Renard
motor road-trains to Australia didn’t come off;
anyway, nothing has been heard of the co. since.
Yet Queensland’s Railway Commissioner Thallon
thought so well of the contrivance when he saw it
at work on his travels last year that his Govern-
ment is importing tbe mechanism of one for use
in a district where Thallon wants to develop the
trade a bit before he supplies it with a railway. As
shown in French pictures, the road-train is a
lumbering caterpillar; but it can crawl over
obstacles that a traction engine won’t look at, and,
that seems to be its chief feature.
“B.B.”: In the sugar districts of Mac-
kay the young Bananalander hunts the cane-
beetle with much enthusiasm, and thereby earns
bulky pocket-money. Beetle-catching is" a fine
art. In addition to spending three or four hours
every morning gathering the pest by fist, the
juveniles set traps in the thickly-infested parts at
night. The favorite trap consists of a large tub
containing six inches of water, a hurricane lamp
being propped up on two bricks in the centre.
The light attracts the beetle, and it perishes in a
watery grave. As much as 81b. or 101 b. dead
weight of beetle can thus be caught in one tub in
a night. But the kids’ harvest is almost over.
The beetle season only lasts four months in the
year.
Out in the Taroom (Q.) district, the
prickly-pear reckons it grows as well as in any part
of Bananaland. There are-thousands and thou-
sands and more thousands of acres of it, and in
some places it has encroached upon the roads to
shell an extent that teams have trouble jn passing
each other. Yet there are people living at
Taroom who remember the time, not so very long
ago either, when all the spiny curse in tbe district
was a clump in the garden at Rocliedale station.
It is said that a former manager of that station
happened to sample some pear jelly at a place he
was visiting in N. S. Wales. He liked it so well
that he asked for some of the plant from which it
was made. Then he took the calamity home to
his wife, and she planted it in the garden. It
grew, and lias been doing wgll since. A good
many Queenslanders would like to "have about ten
minutes’ conversation with that man.
Northern sugar-growers don’t feel too
comfortable over the engagement of Dr. Maxwell
to shake up the Maffra beet-sugar industry in
Victoria. Maxwell, besides being a sugar expert,
is a fine organiser and a whale for reducing chaos
to order ; and if his success in making the bank-
rupt northern “central” sugar-mills stand
steadily on their feet should be repeated at the
long unused Maffra mill, the northern growers
will have another nightmare besides the C. S. R.
Co. to keep them company o’ nights.
When Kidston was wearing his coat the
right-side out he kept an eye on the surroundings
of the sugar-mills and other places where the
northern workman congregates, and, like a good
Scotsman, was readier any day to give a hand in
establishing a Savings Bank than a pub. Appar-
ently, however, the northern workman has to
take his chances these times. A Government
railway is being built out to Evelyn. “The
amount of drinking,” reported the inspector,
“on this extension has been phenomenal
and a disgrace to civilisation, retarding the
progress and increasing the cost of the work.
I attribute this largely to the reckless and indis-
criminate manner in which licenses have been
granted. . . . The police objected to about 80 of
the 100 per cent, increase in hotel licenses, and
gave ample proof to the Bench that these hotels
were not required along the 'line. But the
Licensing Bench, composed of many justices, out-
voted the P.M. . . . At Tolga, where there is only
a population of 200, there are six hotels, the
licenses of four of which were unsuccessfully
opposed by the police.” The Chief Engineer for
Railways always protested, and then the P.M.
was asked for a report, which supported the other
evidence. But the awful J.P. prevailed, and the
track of the railway-making has been like the
trail of Gehenna.
ONE MAN, ONE JOB.
“ Hey! Mind the train! Mind the train!"
“***!*!!* Can't yer see I've got enough to do to mind the 'orse?”
Another imported blessing has just been
transferred to the other side of the ledger, and
henceforth is to be reckoned in with tbe curses.
A few years ago the African, box-thorn was im-
ported, and had a great time in suburban gardens.
Now the Home Secretary has instructed the local
authorities to enter it up on the list of noxious
weeds; for it is discovered that in its new home
if grows and spreads more rapidly than the
prick!y pear. If the box-thorn were given its
fling, the spiky anathema would, by comparison
with it, be a beautiful benediction in a few years.
“Via”: Notwithstanding official denials
as'to the,influx of Chinamen into North Queens-
land, I have it on first-class authority from two
different sources that, on the hinterland behind
Cairns, and stretching right up to the Mosman
and Daintree rivers, scores of Chows can now be
seen who bear the brand of the new-chum most
conspicuously. ;My informants spoke to some,
but mostly without response. Then a seasoned
John would excuse the blankness of the , new
Chow by saying, “That my cousin. Him come
from Mellybun. A lil bit sick longa head.”
There are scores of these mysterious Chows now
where, twelve months ago, there were only units.
Where do they come from, and how do they come ?
The Education Department is gradually
brushing “sandy blight” away from the western
edge of Bananaland. In order to thwart the fly
which does the damage, screens are fixed to the
windows and doors. After a while the insects
find their only chance of entrance is to crowd
through the door as the children march in to
school, so they gather there like the gushfulgod-
desses on the first night of a Nellie Stewart season.
Others rest on the pupils’ backs and wait for a
“lift” in. But as the children reach the top of
the steps in double file, each couple brushes the
winged pests from the pair in front, and so on to
the end couple. The teacher, with many fantas-
tic sweeps of his duster about the last boys and
himself, passes quickly in. The gauze door bangs,
and the fly is foiled again, and the “blight”
curse is thus being gradually beaten.

QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 2, 1909.
Mr Dear Moorabtnda,—
On my recovery from the shock of hearing that
the elderly William Macgregor was to take the
place of our present elegant Excellency, I bunted
up the pigeon-holes of memory to try and dis-
cover if I knew anything about him, further than
that he was an affable old potentate with a
billiard-ball cranium and a pointed beard. All I
could discover was that Mrs. Mac. once made a
fierce onslaught upon a boarding-house Evange-
line, whom.she accused of stealing her hankies. I
dropped upon the broom-laden lady later on the
day of battle, and she sniffed out her indignation.
“If I wanted to lift wipes I’d go for something
decent,, not them common things.. Why, there’s
Miss Browne’s reel Irish linens lying all over the
place.” Miss Browne was our own Pattie, and
most of her things were beautiful in the way of
lawn and lace, while those of our coming Gover--
noress were Well, she was frugal in those
days, in the matter of clothes. William, however,
is a real man’s man, and has a lofty reputation for
battling with cannibals and other fierce sundries..
Our departing Ex. spread himself upon his
favorite subject, education, on Wednesday even-
ing last, and laid himself out to some good pur-
pose. If there is one thing more than another
that the Chelmsford lord has firm views upon, it
is how to hammer sense into the young, (He is
also believed to hold firm views to the effect that
he won’t again be caught napping on constitu-
tional points.) His advice to young Australians
is that they should learn to love and defend
their country, that they should tell the truth
and thus shame the Devil so that he will
blush right down to the root of his tail, and
that they should get a hustle on. The Chelms-
ford lady went along with her lord. The Kidston
Premier took the chair, and endeavored to look as
if he had an inner knowledge of Horace, while his
other half bowed her glossy head in frank bore-
dom. This appearance of bearing up under
adverse circumstances is the usual atmosphere of
our Prernieress, whose only alternative expression
is one of meek suffering. I saw her recently at
a large Hibernian gathering, where she sat ("sur-
rounded by 22 Holy Fathers and 16 jolly Christian
Brethren) through a national programme of 18
items, each with an outcrop of encores. And I’ll
lay heavy odds that she was thinking. “ What
have I done, a decent Scotch body, that this
should come upon me ? ”
There is a certain suburb nigh unto this city,
christened Yeronga, which for energy and in-
genuity is hard to beat. That is to say, the
feminine portion of it can’t be whipped readily.
A large number of months ago the males of the
neighborhood decided that they wanted a parish
hall, to serve as church, chess club, recreation
centre (Bridge and the like), and a place wherein
they might foregather and disagree. They tried
to raise the necessary lucre, but as that sordid
commodity didn’t flow in, they cooled off, and left
it to the women, accompanying their legacy with
the cheering opinion that “ they’d never sight it.”
That insult fairly riled the Yeronga “bits o’
muslin,” and they waded in to win. First, they
held several dozen fancy fairs, and when those
failed (all the men for miles round being supplied
with enough shaving tidies, slippers, match-
scratehers and pouches for the term of their natural
lives) they switched off on to moonlight concerts in
the garden, andsuppers. Now the Yeronga girl can
cook, so the aggregate young man came along in
droves, and after holding his best maiden’s
hand throughout the programme, he fell
upon the cookies and was not afraid. But
after a while all the available young men
and maidens got engaged, and then they
didn’t want any moonlight concerts, so the
audiences fell off. Did the promoters get down-
hearted? Not a bit! They commenced fancy
cricket matchejy qnd as these are now running
strong there’s little doubt that Parish Hall will
get itself built. Added to which the picture pre-
sented by a staid matron fielding as Boadicea, or
batting as Mary Queen of Scots, or bowling as
Titania just tickles me to death, as the Yankee
lady said when asked how the idea of marrying the
admiral struck her.,
A lot of sympathy is expressed with Mr. and
Mrs. M‘Gregor, of S. Brisbane, whose small son
was killed by a tram a few days ago. Our cars
are about tbe least dangerous in the world ; but
the little victim dived, boy-like, from behind a
passing car and on to the lines, just about 24
inches from the advancing footboard. All the
brake-power in the world could hardly meet a
case like that.
A wedding of note and romance will be that of
station-owner Bloxsome and Miss MTlwraith
Taylor, the Titian-haired sister of the manager of
Jimbour.. It is to eventuate on the 24th at Too-
woomba in the mountains.
The Dreadnought scare has caused a certain num-
ber of youthful Government clerks to fall into that
substance that we commence dinner with. Some
frolicsome soul conceived the idea of a bogus sub-
scription list towards tbe cost of presenting an
up-to-date fighting machine to the central office of
the empire.. The whole department put down
its names, promising anything from one guinea to
ten, and when a respectable sum had been reached
the frisky promoter made out a cheque for the
total in his own name. Probably this was never
meant to escape the front door of the Treasury
Buildings ; but a fellow conspirator who was still
more frisky got hold of it and sent it to the bank,
where it met with cold rebuff. The matter was
reported' to headquarters: The consequence is
that the Under-Sec. is to sit upon the matter,
after which the Home Sec., will sit upon
him, and I suppose the Cabinet will sit on the
Home Sec. ; so that the pile will soon be a second
Caesar’s column.
Talking of the Home Sec. reminds me that
“our Joey’’has taken to dressing so like unto
Governor Chelmsford that if you don’t notice the
white patch which the politician wears in
his thatch, you’d think they were twins dressed
alike for economy. T’other day the Governor
went a-visiting at the Petrie Terrace Police Bar-
racks, to give away a medal or so; and as he
emerged from the vice-regal motor, Joey emerged
from an adjacent doorway, and behold they were
as one man—striped pants, grey frock-coats and
grey bell-toppers (why does every well-conditioned
Governor wear a grey top storey ?) They were
just as like as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. If
I were the Chelmsford lord I’d blossom out in
kilts (he could borrow them from the Chief
Government Medical Officer), and see what the
Home Sec. would do then.
So the Bulloo seat has gone to Labor 1 Another
feather lost to the Government barnyard, and one
that it can ill spare. Indeed, when the Speaker’s
chair gets filled from the Ministerial ranks (which
it probably will), it is doubtful whether there will
be enough counters to go round the first game of
divide.
Yours affectionately,
MARIO.
Rockhampton is liable to fall over a plough
in the main street now ; for the place is being
ripped up to prepare for the street tramway.
The cars are to go by steam, and the engines are
to be much the same as those in use in Paris, and
are to be quite festive-looking vehicles compared
with.the pensioned Sydney steam trams. Premier
Phidston will probably be asked to start the first
car about Rockhampton’s Carnival time—that is
to say, when the North holds out its hand to
collar the winter-tripper’s silver.
The Oldest Inhabitant writes
Apropos the breeze about the appointment of the first
Queensland Chief Justice (B. 18/3/’O9). Governor Bowen,
writing in 1562 to Sir Roundell Palmer, Solicitor-General
of England (afterwards Lord Chancellor as Baron Sel-
borne), asked him to select a Chief Justice, and said :
“What we want is a gentleman rather than a mere
lawyer. The principal officials in a colony form a sort of
social aristocracy. The Chief Justice ranks next to the
Governor, and his influence extends far beyond the
sphere of his judicial duties—indeed, whether for good or
for evil, it is immense. The first Chief Justice may set
his mark for the future on this great and rising colony.”
And Roundell Palmer sent out a gentleman rather than a
mere lawi'er. The gentleman was a per.-on of the name
of Cockle, and it is almost as hard to be respectful to a
person named Cockle as to one named Snooks or
Boschenheimer.


THE BACKBLOCKS.
“ Backblocks! ” said the Traveller, in scorn.
“There ain't no backblocks left. Can’t travel a
hundred miles nowadays without running into
somebody! You don't know what backblocks is,
beggin your pardon, ma'am.”
Before dawn there was no doubt left in our mind
about the outside cattle coming in. It seemed as
though every beast on the run must come into the
Sterling that night for a drink. Every watcrhole
out-back is as the axis of a great circle, cattle pads
narrowing into it like the spokes of a wheel from
every point of the compass, and along these pads
around the Sterling mob after mob of cattle came in
in single file, treading carelessly, until each old bull
leader, scenting the camp, gave its low, deep,
drawn-out warning call that told of danger at hand.
—“ We of the Never Never,” by Mrs. -Eneas Gunn.
’Twas merry in the glowing morn, among the gleaming
grass,
To wander as we’ve wandered many a mile.
And blow the cool tobacco cloud, and watch the white
wreaths pass,
Sitting loosely in the saddle all the while.
'Twas merry in the backwoods, when we spied the station
roofs.
To wheel the wild scrub cattle at the yard,
With a running fire of stockwhips, and a fiery run of hoofs;
Oh! the hardest day was never then too hard.

THE LOWING HERDS.
By J. D. FITZGERALD.
In cattle raising we have some of the most pic-
turesque facets of Australian life. Here is the
wild, free life, in the open air and on horseback,
which should attract thousands of adventurous
spirits from the Old World. Here is life which
only requires the master hand of a Mayne Reid
to bring out the romance of it, and every boy of
imagination would look forward to the day when
he would be old enough to go “ jackerooing ” in
North Queensland. Already it attracts some of
the finest products of English, Irish, and
Scotch manhood, while on the stations in
Queensland you will find sons of wealthy men,
bankers, commercial men and millionaires, who
have been drawn to it by the certain lure which
the life of the cattle station has for the ad-
venturous. And the appeal is not wholly to the
instinct of adventure, or to the man whose soul is
in revolt from the humdrum life of towns. There
is a solid element of self-interest; in it. These
young men have, in most cases, deliberately sought
the rough and healthy life on horseback and in
camp—sleeping with a saddle for a pillow and the

stars and the wonderful tropic night fora resplen-
dent canopy—as a training-school for their future
life-work... There is„a. big.living jn.it—a. safe and
comfortable career.
For some time past there has been a revolt in
our Australian cities from the routine formerly
pursued by men whose prosperous worldly circum-
stances opened out a university career for their
sons. This revolt has come as much from the
boys as from their fathers, and it meant that,
instead of a smart young man setting himself
to become a member of one of the “ genteel ”
professions—law or medicine—he preferred to be-
gin the stern battle of life on the land. The pro-
fessions were all very well for a while, but when
every bright young man became either a barrister,
a solicitor, or a doctor, those professions became
somewhat overcrowded, and their gentility soon
savored of the “shabby genteel.” The spectacle
of a young man whose university career had been
brilliant, sitting down “in chambers,”and rotting
away the best years of his life waiting for briefs”
and finally, at 40 or so—if he lasts—beginning to
get into a position to make a home and marrv,
and dependent on his health and personal exer-
tions to make a provision for himself and his
family, was not always an alluring one for the
young men who were desirous of getting to grips
with the world, and facing the problem of mak-
ing their way. There was no allurement in the
prospect of a young solicitor throwing himself into
the tense struggle of the overcrowded lower
branch, and trying to pick up a living, even-
tually perhaps reaching the small emin-
ence of a managing clerkship for someone
else, or sinking to the precarious existence of a
practitioner in the police courts. The prospective
doctor saw before him the drudgery of a bush
town, with hard work, long distances to travel,
and small rewards, or the brilliant prospects of a
“general” practice in the city, with a “lodge”
connection—in other words, constant drudgery
and “appearances” to be kept up.
Those young men—and their fathers who could
advance them some capital to start with—began
to look to the land, and to the life of a yeoman
farmer, or a station-owner, after experience
gained. So the agricultural colleges took
hundreds who might otherwise have acquired a
great deal of possibly useless learning in the uni-
versities, and the others went out as “ jackeroos ”
on the stations, to learn how to handle cattle and
sheep, and to manage horses ; to become learned
in pastures and in grasses ; and to know the quali-
ties of “country” when thev saw it, and to
of its “carrying capacity ” either for cattle or sheep.
To Queensland the great bulk of these go for
there the experience gained is likely to be turned
soon to good account. For Queensland is going
to be the great cattle country of the world ; first
because of the suitability of its soil and climate
~, inching to give it its picturesque name,
although a name not used in Australia—and,
secondly, because it has the greatest amount of
territory available for the man who, after gaining
CATTLE SCENE AT LAIDLEY, SOUTH QUEENSLAND.
his experience on one of the big stations,
determines to take up land for himself, and be-
come a station-owner on a large or small scale.
And, again, at the risk of calling too often for
the great Australian novelist who is to be, I would
draw attention to the romantic side of this great
brotherhood of station hands “outback.” They
are our Foreign Legion—what the Algerine Legion
is to France. This brotherhood contains men of
mystery and scapegraces, side by side with uni-
versity men, youths with the fever of adventure in
their blood, and cool, calculating business men—
old heads on young shoulders—who are learning
to be cattle kings and lords of the future flocks
, and herds. To some—
... all their roads are new and strange,
And through their blood there runs
The vagabonding love of change
That drove them westward of the range
And westward of the suns.

Then there are tire grizzled old veterans, the
celibate monks of pioneering. These are the
men of stout fibre, strong, enduring, kindly, with
brave hearts, centaurs in their mode of life, good
comrades, ready to die fora “mate”—they are
the nation builders. These will be the backbone of
our defence in the day of trial or of foreign in-
vasion. No young man in Britain, or Canada,
or the continent of Europe, need be ashamed of
enrolling himself in this gallant band of pioneers;
and there is a rich reward for many who become
enrolled in the company of these “musqueteers of
the bush.”
The prospects of the cattle trade in Queensland
are illimitable. Queensland is to-day the largest
cattle-owner in the Commonwealth, and the
largest exporter of meat in cold storage. That
the Commonwealth is not a “world-beater” in
cattle, as it is in sheep, is due to the fact that
from the earliest times wool was regarded as the
chief factor in the industrial destiny of all the
States. Cold storage is a comparatively modern
process, and the distance of Queensland from the
staple markets of the world is a handicap that has
only in comparatively recent times been overcome
by the increase of speed due to the advance of
ship-building. There were one or two accidental
WEHL VIEW, BOXMOOR, GRANTHAM, SOUTH QUEENSLAND.
factors which helped Queensland on its career as
a stock-owner.
For example, the supplies for the American
troops in the Philippines were largely drawn from
Queensland and N.S.W. during the war of occu-
pation and the subsequent native wars, and there
is still a very heavy export to the American
colony. In the six years from 1901 to 1906,
55,800,0001 b. of beef were sent in cold storage to
the Philippines.
Ever since the year 1880 Queensland has
owned the most cattle of anv of the States of
the Commonwealth. In 1894 it owned over
/,000,000. Says Mr. Knibbs, the Commonwealth
Statistician: “By far the finest specimens of
beef-producing cattle are those raised in the
tropical districts of the Commonwealth, i.e., in the
northern parts of Queensland, in the Northern
lerntory of South Australia, and in the Kimberley
districts in the north of Westralia. ” “Until 1880,”
he continues, “N.S.W. occupied the leading
petition in the Commonwealth group as a cattle-
raising State, but in that year Queensland forged
ahead, and obtained a lead which it has since
maintained. The extent of this lead has, how-
ever, varied considerably, owing principally to
the effects produced by the tick fever and
droughts, from both of which causes the Queens-
land herds suffered more severely than those of
the other States. In fact, during the period from
1894, when the number of cattle in Queensland
attained its maximum of rather more than
7,000,000, to 1903, when the number recorded was
less than 2,500,000, an uninterrupted decline was
experienced. During the past three years, how-
ever, a rapid improvement has taken place, and the
total reached on 31st December, 1906, was more
than 3,400,000.” Later figures than the statisti-
cian’s show 3,800,000 odd.
The facts in that statement show the marvellous
recuperative powers of Queensland. They show
also that the agencies of Government, acting in
friendly co-operation with the stock-owners, have
succeeded in coping to a great extent with the
tick pest, which is now rapidly coming under con-
trol as its nature is better understood, and is cer-
tain to be stamped out. The paternal care of the
Queensland Government is shown in its legislation
for the eradication of diseases and pests which
prejudicially affect the stock. A system of strict
inspection of all beasts imported from abroad,
and of the fodder with which they were fed
while in transport, is in operation. A Board of
Stock Commissioners has charge of the application
of the Diseases in Stock Act, and funds are
provided by a Government subsidy and per capita
assessments on stock. Powers under this Act
provide for the prohibition of stock or carcases
from beyond the State, put restrictions on the re-
moval of any stock from one part of the State to
another, and prescribe the route by which infected
stock must travel. They also provide for disin-
fection and cleansing of stock and everything per-
taining to their entourage, and for quarantine.
Then there are strict laws for the encouragement
of the destruction of marsupials (wallaby, pade-
melon, bandicoot, or kangaroo-rat) which destroy
the pastures and the grasses which are used for
the cattle.
In like manner the State authorities have in
operation a law which provides for the strict in-
spection of live stock and meat intended for ex-
port. No stock may be exported from Queensland
to any place outside the Commonwealth unless a
certificate is obtained from the examining in-
spector that the stock are “sound and free from
disease,” and that proper arrangements have been
made for their accommodation, food, and water
on the voyage. The transport vessels are also
inspected, and the meat exported is examined,
and has the Government brand, mark, or label
upon it, guaranteeing it as sound and free from
disease ; and all meat found unsound or diseased
is destroyed.
The central and southern districts of Queens-
land, on the tablelands, will always be devoted
to dairying, and there the Ayrshires, Jerseys,
Guernseys, and Holsteins will be found. But the
great North will be the home of the “cattle
ranches,” from Townsville to Cape York, where
the Shorthorn breed will flourish. Eighty per
cent, of the cattle in Queensland are Shorthorns,
and 15 per cent. Herefords or a Hereford-Shqrt-
horn cross. Mr. P. R. Gordon, Chief Inspector
of Stock, tells us something of this evolution of
knowledge of the stock best adapted to the
climate, soil, and conditions: “Notwithstanding
that the Devon cross or Shorthorn admittedly
produces the finestof meat, and carcases admirably
suited as freezers, the Devon has not made the
headway in Queensland that was predicted for it.
There would appear to be a general opinion that
the size of the Devon militates against its adop-
tion ; but the cross on Shorthorn produces a
carcase of from 7001 b. to 7501 b. of most excellent
meat, and the Devon has the reputation of being ;
hardy and a thrifty feeder.” It will thus be seen
that, by a process of artificial selection, Queens- 1
land stock-masters have developed the kind of
beast which is best adapted to the circumstances
of the country and the markets.
The figures which I quote here will show that ’
the ownership of cattle is better distributed than
that of sheep, for while there were only 2748'
owners of sheep in Queensland in 1907, there were
28,537' owners of 3.892,232 cattle in that same!
year, or an average size of herd of 130. So the,
cattle are more evenly allotted than the sheep
on the average, although, taking herds of 1001 up-
wards, 626 owned 2,567,173 cattle, or an average
herd of about 4100. ;
This is a phase of the development of Queens-
land which is capable of infinite expansion. It
only requires men of boldness and resource.
There is no esoteric mystery about the business
and any intelligent man can soon learn it if he is
not afraid of roughing it while he gains his'
knowledge. The State authorities will-give him
all the aid necessary to enable him to secure the
right kind of land, and such land he can obtain on
lease at the average of 15s. odd per square
mile per annum ; and other portions are even ob-
tainable free, with a bonus added, if he is prepared
to expend capital and labor in reclaiming the'
splendid lands from vegetable pests which have
got out of hand in a few districts as the result of
the marvellous fecundity of the soil.

Medical Treatment Made Hands
Swell and Run Water—Was as
Helpless as a Baby—Followed
a Neighbour’s Advice and Her
CURE BY CUTICURA
HAS BEEN PERMANENT
“My daughter, Mrs. Hannah Austin,
lives with me, and in September, 1906,
something came on
her hands and feet
which a doctor said
was eczema. H e
gave her a box of
ointment which
caused her hands to
swell and run water.
She was in a dreadful
state and as helpless
as a baby. A neigh-
bour, whose child had
had a similar disease
on the head, recom-
mended me to try Cuticura Ointment.
Finding that it did her good, we went
on trying Cuticura Soap, Cuticura
Ointment, and Cuticura Pills. Being
employed in the mills as a silk worker,
my daughter had had to give up work for
a fortnight, but after using Cuticura
Remedies for a few days she was able
to resume her occupation. The disease
not only affected her hands and feet but
went; up to her elbows. In all she had
two ‘tablets of Cuticura Soap, three
boxes of Cuticura • Ointment (some of
which is still left), and one bottle of
Cuticura Pills. There has been no
return of the distressing eruption and
she is now working regularly. Mrs.
Margaret Doxey, 43, Broad St., Leek,
Staffordshire,. June 19, 1907.”

Business. Robbery, etc.
Commerce is always trying to turn a doubtful
copper by makinsr “ colorable imitations” of the other
fellow’s «-oods. The Australian woollen manufacturers
are now finding that imported cotton tweeds, which are
“ colorable imitations ” of their genuine woollen tweeds,
are knocking their goods out of the market. That would
be bad enough if all the Australian purchasers of the
foreign shoddy knew what they were getting ; but some
of them do not. The oversea imitation is sold to them as
wool, and the fraud which has been made possible by the
foreign manufacturer’s infernal skill is consummated by
the local rag-seller’s infernal villainy; and, needless to
say, he makes a larger profit than if he supplied
his customer with the woollen fabric. There
is always a large “gold-brick” section in every
community which is willing to regard cotton as wool if it
can obtain the “ colorable imitation ” a trifle cheaper ;
and there is also the ignorant or careless section that
doesn’t know or care, or won’t bother to find out. The
imitator and his middlemen prey impartially on both
classes, and the manufacturer of the genuine goods has to
stand aside and ruefully watch the swindling game. At
present the cotton imitations are admitted free to the
Commonwealth. A duty of 30 per cent, has been sug-
gested ; but it is asserted that, to give adequate protec-
tion to the local manufacturers, 40 or 50 per cent, is
needed. Meanwhile, the stuff that looks like the real
thing, but isn’t, is being wrapped round the Australian,
1 an important industry is looking rather sick, and the
ethics of modern business look even murkier than before.
• * * *
“Ejayem ” : Another mean practice has sprung
up in the drapery line in Sydney. A large number of
salesmen are kicking about, out of a regular job, and a
Saturday’s engagement, is a great consideration for these
mostly hard-up men. But some firms engage men from
warehouses. These fellows are on regular pay, so it is a
mean business for them to put in Saturday afternoon and
evening in order to get the 10s., which would be very
acceptable to the poor devil who is “on the outer.” And
presently, even if it isn’t so already, the man from the ware-
house who collars the other fellow’s job will be none the
better off ; for the wholesale fluff man will cut his slave’s
wages down, just as the waiter’s wages and the porter’s
wages are cut down because those parties got into the
habit of taking tips.
* * * *
“F. Croson ” : A friend of mine lately went
to a Melbourne suburban sale-room, with intent to acquire
a cheap pair of blankets. She was considering a pair
when her eye caught a name on a dress-basket full of
women’s clothing. That dress-basket was in the same
heap with the blankets, and had presumably come from
the same house; and the name my friend recognised as
that of a woman who had recently died of cancer. It was
her clothing in the dress-basket, and inquiry revealed to
her that this had been considered a desirable way of dis-
posing of a “quantity of little-used wearing apparel for
which the owner has' no further use,” as the advertise-
ments put it. She left in a hurry ; but if any of the
women who attend that saleroom presently find them-
selves suffering from cancer, they will understand from
this par exactly ho\v they got it.
» * * *
“Cict ” : Is there no law, or Board, or anything
that can smite the retailer of ancient and obsolete food-
stuffs, who, per medium of up-to-date labels, hides his
transgressions, and gulls the consumer? F’rinstance, I
wandered into a Riverina store the other day, and sought
half a pound of tea. After assurances from the shop-
runner that "the nectar only left th| land of its birth
about the day before yesterday, and bis depositions being
backed up by the wad glued on the other end of the par-
cel, I went home and boiled the billy. Between bites,
I recommenced investigations on the wrapper, and aim-
lessly hauled off the half-gummed ticket, thereby expos-
ing another-of the same species, only it was just one year
older, its face being splashed with the saying, “1907.”
Trying again, I unearthed another sign, intended to in-
form all and sundry that the weed was among the first of
t;he 1906 season’s pickings. And if the missus hadn’t
shrieked that, a strange yellow dog was chasing the
poddies through the cultivation patch, I have strong
suspicions that the mine would have yielded another reef
or two.

“ Hypo ” : “I’m going home to get my harness
off for the first time in two days and nights,” said the
stevedore. “ It’s always that way with us. The boats
must be got away. I turned in for an hour or two last
I ni'dit, but I couldn’t sleep for the noise of the winches,
so’l got up. Good job I did. The co. had a spare mate
on. There's always a spare mate. I had left orders in
writing that only rough stuff was to go in the after-hold.
Yet wlien I went aboard, here was that idiot putting
tea in with bonedust. He had five slings down when I
turned up. Tea with bonedust! I said : ‘ Mr. Mate, that
won’t do at all.’ He said, sarcastically, ‘De Old Man said
you vas in charge of de after-hold. lam in charge here.
I load him dot way ! ’ ‘ You won’t load tea and bonedust
together, anyhow,’ I says; ‘so take it out!’ Then he
said lie would bring the boss. He did. The tea had to
come out, and I had to stay on. Tea and bonedust ! And
one of the Forty Thieves’ ships too. They’ve got trouble
enough just now. Their new boat has a cracked high-
pressure cvlinder, and must lie up till another comes from
England. ’ No duplicates in this country, and no manu-
facturers. This country doesn’t deserve to have up-to-
date machinery. But—tea and bonedust! It makes me
laugh.”

“ X.P.D.” : Oan anybody tell me wliy stewards

DISILLUSION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Standard, in welcoming: Maoriland’s noble grift,
contrasts Premier Ward’s superb words, “ If necessary,
two Dreadnoughts,” with Mr. Asquith’s “if necessary ”
grudgingly applied to the four conditional Dreadnoughts
in April, 1910.— Cablegram.
“ Two Dreadnoughts! Forty hundred thousand quid ! !
Stupendous” ! cried the Editor. “ Begad,
When I contrast with this our paltry bid,
I grow, despite myself, both grieved and sad.
“ Bring me” —this to a clerk —“ a Whitaker
Or Statesman’s Year Book, Anno D. ’OB ;
I am consumed with longing to refer
In detail to this patriotic State.
“ Merely to say its Premier’s as ‘ superb ’
As Asquith’s infamous does not suffice :
I want to know about each sheep and herb
And human in Ward’s isles of fire and ice.
“ Turn up the population figures. What!
Less than a million ? Marvellous ! But then
The country teems with virgin gold. To that,
No doubt is due its glut of wealthy men.
“Look under ‘Finance.’ You will find, I’ll swear,
This Land of Promise stands for solvency ;
No European country will compare
With it, be sure, for rugged honesty'.
“ Say that again ! Owes how much? Man, you’re mad.
Sixty-six million pounds, and most of it
To England. Fo I! Hand me the book, my lad—
Y'ou’re wallowing chin-deep in error’s pit.
“ Lord save us ! Do I dream ? Or am X dead ?
This place has cadged from us to meet its dearth
Till now it owes more sovereigns per head
Than any country on this wide old earth.
“ Also it has no navy of its own ;
It can’t provide a single fighting hand ;
All it can do is raise another loan
By way of boosting up the Mother Land.
“ The nerve of it! Hand me my stylo pen,
A ream of copy-paper, and get out
The while I put, before the face of men,
This lavisher of other’s cash to rout.”

There’s nothing like an Edison Phono-

all say soli
Everybody who handles a “Buffalo Pitts” Portable Steam Engine
agrees that for all round work in general, and agricultural purposes in
particular, it stands right in a class by itself.
We say so; our Agents and Travellers say so; and BEST OF ALL,
its users, of whom there are hundreds throughout Australia, to a man
ALL say so.
Proof of the above is furnished in the fact that, for purely agricultural
purposes, there are in use in Australia MORE “Buffalo” Engines than all
other makes combined.
Further proof is given below in the reproduced letters of responsible
agriculturists who for YEARS past have been using “Buffalo” Engines
successfully and most profitably.
Additional proof is contained in our files and can be had for the
asking—letters of the most enthusiastic praise from farmers in every
Stale—copies of which will be promptly furnished on application, and
which will be found to be equally as convincing as the following: —
“Bowning, N.S.W., 13\7'\08.
I have used the 8 h.p. ‘Buffalo ' Portable Engine I bought in 1901
“on nearly everything — chaffcutters, threshers, saw mill, driving a grind-
“stone and sheep shearing machines.
“I never had any trouble with it at any time, and I consider it to be
“very light on wood and water.
“I have driven my engine all round the Yass
“district with three small horses; some seasons
“they are travelling from ten to twelve weeks
“without a break. Yours truly,
“Corrowong Station, via Delegate, N.S.W., July 10, ’OB.
“In reply to your letter of the 7th inst., we have much pleasure in
“stating that for the past six years or more we have been using an 8 h.p.
“ ‘Buffalo Pitts’ Engine to drive chaffcutters, threshers, saw mills, shearing
“machines, etc. It has always performed its work economically and well,
“giving very little trouble and consuming a minimum quantity of both fuel
“and water. We can thoroughly recommend it
“to any purchasers as a highly efficient engine.
“A ny further particulars we shall be pleased to
“give at any time. Yours faithfully,
pro Excrs. late James <J Hare,
By reason of its Light Weight in comparison with its great Power,
its splendid governing, and general ease of management, its economy as
regards wood and water, it invariably gives GENUINE satisfaction to its
owner—satisfaction so apparent to residents in its vicinity that every
“Buffalo ” sold becomes a non salaried but most energetic and convincing
salesman on our behalf.
Sold at Reasonable Prices and on such Exceptionally Favourable Terms
that, after the first small payment, the engine can more than earn the
subsequent payments before they become due.

TO KEEP YOU SICK!
THE first impulse of persons who find that they are ailing in any way is to
plunge into a chemist’s and purchase a box of pills or a bottle of some patent
medicine. . . Failing to get more than temporary relief from this they then
consult a doctor, and he writes a prescription which more than likely calls for the
same medicine, only in a different form from what the patient has already taken.
The same result, generally. Next, the patient comes to the conclusion that this
doctor didn’t diagnose the case right, and then goes to another, with the same
result. And so on.
Our modern medical system Is a foolish system. We practically pay
our doctors to keep us ill. Their prosperity depends not on our health,
BUT ON OUR SICKNESS! . . . To-day very little is known of medicine
and its use. The wisest doctor can do but little more than clear out
the system or accelerate the action of the heart. When he has done these
thing's he has reached the end. MEDICINE CANNOT MAKE STRENGTH.
Now, just study yourself for a moment. The failure or breaking down of any
•organic function means that it has not strength to do its work. If there was any
nourishment in medicine it might bring about a healthy change, but you know there
is not. Drugs, medicines, stimulants, narcotics and antidotes are POISONS, not
food. Food is needed to build up new energy. Electricity is nerve food, nerve life.
No pain or debility can exist in a body charged with Electric Life; you can have
no Weattness, no Inactive Parts, no Sheumatism, Indi-
gestion, Constipation or Kidney Troialble, if you fill your
body with it, because the life generated by this grand force gives health and
strength to every organ, and
Dr. MCLAUGHLIN’S ELECTRIC BELT
is the newest and most successful method of applying it. It is a series of small batteries which you wear about your waist.
It worKs wHile you sleep, and generates its power constantly. It is worn as comfortably as your clothing,
adjusted in a minute, and made as. strong or mild as you like by the pressure of a finger upon the regulator. With it
you can carry the current direct to the spot affected. You can get the full current at your ankles, feet, arms, shoulders,
head or any other part of your body. It has a Special Attachment for men. We have fixed a price for it which puts it
within the reach of everyone. Its price is as low as £1 in many cases.

FOR
FIVE
YEARS
Despaired of Being Cured.
ONLY those who suffer, or have suffered, from
piles can imagine the agony which this
ailment causes, and only those who have
tested ZAM-BUK know the relief it brings. Piles
are caused by congestion of the hemorrhoid veins.
ZAM-BUK cools the burning surfaces, stops the
bleeding, softens the walls of the congested veins,
and gives prompt relief. Even in chronic cases,
ZAM-BUK will not be found to fail. It cures when
all else fails. The following case was of five
years’ standing, yet ZAM-BUK proved equal!

“I have been a terrible sufferer from itching and
bleeding piles,” says Mr. J. H. Livingston, an
engineer, employed at the Chilling Works, Young,
N.S.W. “I was troubled with them for five long
years. No one knows what agony I suffered, at times
becoming so bad that I was forced to lay up for days
together. I tried every possible so-called cure for
piles, without deriving any lasting benefit. A few of
my friends, knowing what agony I was undergoing,
recommended me to try Zam-Bui:, but after using so
many other remedies in vain, I naturally did not place
much confidence in it. Continuing to suffer untold
agony, however, I eventually gave Z.am-Buk a trial,
and am happy to say that after a few applications the
wonderful easing and soothing effect was very
comforting. Persevering with Zam-Buk, the piles
went completely away, and I can confidently say that I am now perfectly cured.”

knots—a world’s record. —Cable.
Dreadnoughts shake the list’ning earth,
and shame the fleets of yore ;
Their shadows darken all the seas ; the
rending crash and roar
Of their broadsides command Mankind and bid
the councils cease.
Harsh-voiced, immense, the Kings of War rise in
the cause ‘of peace.
The dockyards ring by night and day ; the clash
of steel on steel
Betrays the armorers at work ; anon, from truck
to keel,
Clad in his fighting gear, another monarch will
emerge
To overawe the lesser craft that ride on swell and
surge.
Up from the gutter of the trough I gaze upon
their might,
Then scuttle like a ’frighted rat a-down the waves
of night;
They are great rolling hills of steel—frail ghost of
strength am I,
Yet which will float when ends the fight no man
dare prophesy.
Mad speed alone! That is my one slight hold
upon this life;
I spy, and fly, and wait and watch the outskirts of
the strife;
I tend and guard my battle line, and watch my
chance to slip,
Assassin-like, thro’ smoke and spray when bigger
foemen grip.
Thro’ water torn and lashed by shell I leap with
all my strength,
Content to die if I can gash a death wound in that
length
That rolls in its stupendous rage upon the tortured
sea—
(But God 1 what joy to back unhurt from its death

Two million pounds of minted gold—nine hundred

I vanish like a hooded priest a-down the aisles of
War;
The vengeful shells whine overhead, and in a
ghastly flood
The searchlights pour their deathly rays on waves
all stained with blood.
Too late ! For all their vaunted skill, they cannot
find the mark—
The raving guns that crash and flame behind me
in the dark !
(A shadow like a running hound half-buried in
the spray
Skims for a second on a wave—and melts ! “ Got

Afar, I see the signals flash a message down the

They seek to mend their battle chain ! The broken

By splendid chance, and wondrous speed, and
dark, smoke-blinded sea.
Hath this Goliath of the deep been given unto

The Dreadnoughts trample down the seas before the

But , vermin-flat upon the waves, the shade of
Vengeance waits;
The sea-kings walk abroad in pride their brother

With stars about their masthead lamps—but Death

The Interference of Dinan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
”| TNTIL the construction of the Brulong
section of the railway line to Hotandusty
commenced, Cam McMaster had been
happy enough. That happening led Graham to
take some of the workers in as boarders. Cam
was a weekly visitor at the Graham homestead,
but the coming of the railway toilers made him
feel somewhat crowded out. Also, he felt sad and
angry. He was “on’’with Laura Graham, and
hitherto had feared no rival, but now big Joe
Otway graced the home of Laura with his bulky
presence.
For twelve months Cam, who was boundary
rider and other things out at old Daley’s run, had
ridden in to see his lady every Saturday without
fail.
He loved Laura. He told himself so very often,
but he didn’t mention it to the lady. In
fact, he mentioned very little to her, though he
was alone with her for quite a long time at each
visit. He was not a brilliant conversationalist.
Laura seemed to understand him, so he was con-
tent. They would sit together in the kitchen
after Laura had washed up the family tinware,
or they would deposit themselves out in the moon-
light. Cam would play the mouth-organ while
holding Laura’s hand. She would rest her head
oh his shoulder and sigh. Such is the power of
music.
Very often he would sing. His voice was un-
trained, but his rendering of “ The Midnight
Express ” would move anyone. When he opened
his chest to give effect to the pathos of the line
that told of the corpse in the van ahead, it invari-
ably moved Laura’s male parent to hurry away to
the Tanksinkers’ Arms. If Cam, on Jim
Graham’s return, still lingered at the sliprails,
the incensed father, holding forth with a volu-
bility born of beer, would state his opinion of
McMaster as a singer and a man. Cam would
not insist on his right to reply, but would gallop
off ’neath the midnight stars to his lonely hut on
Daley’s run.
The old people, however, did not object to
Cam’s courtship of their girl. True, he only
received a pound a week and tucker ; but he was
of a frugal disposition, and had, to Graham’s
knowledge, quite a decent amount saved. So
they let things slide, considering it a foregone
conclusion that in the fulness of time Cam would
ask for Laura.
The introductipn of Joe Otway, Dennis Dinan,
and a couple more from the railway job served to
brighten things up at Graham’s. It broke the
dull monotony of the life of the selector’s family,
and acted like a tonic on the women folk. Laura
became surprisingly bright. Burly Dennis Dinan,
with his brogue, amused her, but it was to Otway,
the blacksmith, that she paid the most attention.
Cam McMaster soon saw how things were going.
At each visit he noted that his reception was
cooler. He could not get a moment alone with
Laura. Otway appeared to be for ever basking in
the sunshine of her smiles. The seductive tones of
the mouth-organ were now of no avail, and after
once watching Laura whilst the blacksmith
warbled “Island of Dreams ” in a robust tenor,
despair and jealousy gripped Cam’s heart, and he
stayed away.
Mrs. Graham sighed deeply and shook her
head. She had her doubts about the blacksmith.
Another one who had doubts about Joe’s intentions
was Dennis Dinan.
Dinan had his failings, chief of which was his
fondness for beer ; but his goodness of heart more
than made up for his shortcomings in other
directions.
One type of man he had no use for was he who
laid himself out to deceive a woman. He had
been a tent and room mate of Joe Otway’s for
some months. Often he had heard the smith
remark that he must send some money down to
“the old woman.” To Denny, “old woman”
meant the same as “ missus,” and he felt that it
was a wrong thing for a married man to carry on
with a girl.
Often in his comings and goings to and from
the Tanksinkers’ Arms he had happened on Joe
Otway and Laura spooning in the dark of the
moon. Once he had been sober enough to notice
that the girl was crying. Then he resolved to |
tell Otway his opinion of his conduct, and give
him some friendly advice. But pay day inter-
yened, and Dennis was “dead to the world”
while his money lasted. Otway escaped Dinan’s
denunciation, but the navvy, waving a bottle
round his head, told Graham something of his
mind concerning Laura’s danger.
Graham hunted Otway from his home with
much abuse, but no reasonable explanation.
Otway, wondering much but saying little on
account of Laura, took up his abode in a calico
home in the navvy camp. His courting suffered
little hindrance. Love as usual found a way.
As is always the case on large camps, there
were a number of “ slopers ” —men who collected
their wages and left their creditors to mourn their
loss. The vanishment of several recognised dubi-
ous customers caused little surprise, but one day
the camp received a genuine shock. Dinan,
passing through the calico settlement at day-
break, noticed that Otway’s tent seemed deserted.
That did not interest him. No doubt Joe had
gone to his work earlier than usual. But when a
clamorous Chinese hawker came round looking for
Joe, and trying in vain to collect £3105., the news
circulated that Otway, the blacksmith, had left
his creditors and fled.
Dinan returned to Graham’s that night, heavy-
hearted. He wondered how Laura had taken
the news, and told himself that he was to blame
if any harm had come to the girl. He should i
have stopped the flirtation at its commencement.
Laura waited at table as usual, but all her
gaiety was gone. In fact, everyone appeared to
be mournful. After tea, Dinan sought out Laura
to offer his sympathy.
“ And so thot divil av a Joe’s gone,’’ he said ;
and Laura began to weep softly. “Ah! bad’
luck t’th’spalpeen, it’s broken-hearted ye are,
entoirely. The shame it is av him ; an’ wider
woife av his own beyant.”
Laura emitted a wail—almost a howl—of
anguish. I don’t believe it. He promised

THE DANGER
of BACKACHE.
All tired out—scarcely enough
energy to get home in the
evening—no rest when you do
get home —as tired in the
morning as at night. The
back is so weak you can
scarcely bend it —aches and
throbs even when you lie still.
The kidneys are to blame.
They are not taking the
poisons out of the blood. They
need help, and need it at once..
Do not disregard the warning
message of the back that
aches, for the ache comes from
the kidneys (which lie just
beneath the small of the
back), and distinctly tells that
uric acid poisons and waste
matter are accumulating in
your body. These are the
poisons that cause dropsy,
Bright’s disease, rheumatism,
bladder troubles, urinary dis-
orders, diabetes.

SYDNEY PROOF.
COLD IN THE KIDNEY CURED.
Mr. James Hudson, 14 Lennox Street, Newtown, Sydney, says : —“I work
in the Bondi sewer. There is a constant drip there, and when working it
mostly happens that one is wet through. Some parts are better than others, but
while working in the shafts one is continually damp, and this affected my
health. My trouble came with a bad cold in my kidneys, which caused terrible
pains in the back. 1 did my work, but it was most fearful torture for me to do
so, as you can well understand. I was exceedingly bad with these pains when
I saw Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills advertised, and it struck me by the name
of the remedy that it should be good for my complaint, I procured them, and
they cured me in a fairly quick time. I could not take them constantly, being
afraid to use them while working in the wet sewer, but I managed to take two
doses a week. The nature of my work causes me to have slight returns of
the pains, but I take a dose of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, which never fail
to cure me. lam never without them in the house.”
This statement was made nine years ago. Mrs. Hudson says to-day “My
husband is still well, and free of backache, and he has been ever since he used
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, nine years ago.”
BACKACHE AND WEAK BACK CURED.
■ Mr. E. R. Davis, Proprietor Somerset Hotel, Station Street, Newtown,
Sydney, says :—“ I suffered for so long with backache and weak back that lam
pleased to tell other sufferers what will cure these distressing ailments. My
experience proves that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills are the cure. My back
never ceased aching, and besides the pain and inconvenience, I was afraid of
more serious symptoms of kidney trouble developing. I tried remedy after
remedy, but it was only waste of time and money, and I was so disgusted with
medicines for the kidneys that I would not have tried Doan s Backache Kidney
Pills, but a friend told me they had cured him, and urged me to use them. I
am glad I did, for two boxes cured me. This did not happen yesterday, but
four years ago, and lam still free of the backache. My lasting cure proves
that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills permanently cure backache and weak back.”
DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS are sold by all
Chemists and Storekeepers at 2s. 9d. per box (six
boxes 15s. 3d.), or will be posted on receipt of price
by Foster-McClellan Co., 76 Pitt Street, Sydney.
“ There, there,’’ said Dennis, soothingly.
“ Don t take on so, like a good gir-rl, now. It’s
not th’ great trouble you’re in, surely ? ”
Dinan put the query with extreme delicacy.
By way of answer, Laura sobbed more than ever.
“Dear, oh dear!” murmured the perturbed
ganger ; “it’s a bad job, my gir-rl, but don’t take
on. Something must be done. The mother
must niver know. It would break her ould
hear-rt, an’ th’ ole malm ’ud go balmy, to be sure.
Ah, well ! Gir-rls will be gir-rls, I suppose.
Lave it t’ Dennis Dinan. Oi’ll be after findin’ er
way out, my dear. Lave it t’ me.”
For two days, Dinan puzzled his brains striving
to decide how best to help the deceived Laura.
He had a wild idea of asking her to marry him-
self, and thus preserve the honor of the Graham
family, but he put that view aside when the almost-
forgotten name of Cam McMaster entered his
head. Why shouldn’t the old love return to for-
give and forget ?
Laura raised no objection to receiving Cam
once more if Dinan could get him to come. In
fact, she was recovering rapidly from her bereave-
ment. She didn’t act at all as'the troubled, kind-
hearted Irish ganger considered a deceived maiden
should. He shook his head and sighed over the
inscrutable ways of woman.
The very next day, as Dinan stood on the bank
of the cutting overlooking his gang of toilers, a
traveller approached bearing a weighty swag.
“Hullo !” cried Dennis, with a note of joy in
his voice. “Is ic y’self—an’ walkin’ too.”
“It’s me,” said the other, dropping his swag
and sitting on it. “ How’s things?”
“ Well, it’s surproised I am t’ see y’r, so I am,
an’ not ridin’. Wheer’s y’r horse, mahn, an’
wheer do ye be after goin’ to ? ”
“ I’ve sold me horse, chucked me job, an’ I’m
makin’ f’r th’ Rock t’r git th’ train. I’m goin’ t’r
th’ war with th’ Bushmen.”
Cam McMaster spoke as one whose
soul was on fire with a patriotic fervor, and who
longed to fight for the Motherland, but like a
man weary of life’s disappointments.
“Sure, it’s th’ brave b’y ye are,” cried Denny ;
“ but what’s th’ trouble? ”
Cam jerked his thumb in the direction of
Brulong.
“ Th’ little gir-rl beyant, eh ? ” said the navvy.
“ That’s right,” sighed Cam.
“Well, you’re er chicken-hearted lover, to be
shure,” said Dinan, “t’ run away an’ lave y’r
gir-rl to th’ inimy. Why ”
“I know when I’m not wanted,” said Cam,
gloomily.
“Ye were wanted all th’ toime, mahn. Shure,
’twas on’y larrkin’ she was wid th’ blacksmith.
Ye won’t be after goin’ away widout sayin’ good-
bye to th’ colleen, will ye now ? ” urged Denny.
“If I thought she’d see me,” began Cam,
“ I’d”
“See ye! Why, she’s breakin’ her heart for
ye,” cried Dinan. “Go along up now. See th’
gir-rl. Ax her t’forgive ye an’all that. Tell her
ye’re goin’ away t’ foight, an’ ye moight come
back dead an’ buried, wider medal on yer chest.
Say yer last thought will be av her whin’ th’
inimy blows er hole through ye. Go on, mahn,
an’ saze th’ golden opportunity. Stroike whoile
th’ iron’s hot. Ax her t’ marry ye afore ye go so
thot ye c’n die happy, lavin’yer fortune to yer
devoted widdy ”
“But what about Otway?” asked Cam,
hesitatingly.
“Oh, he’s after lavin’ us. Th’ coast’s clear.
Th’ gir-rl’s yours f’r the askin’,” said Denny.
McMaster rose and, swinging his swag on
to his shoulder, made off towards the Graham
homestead.
Dinan, highly pleased, turned his attention to
his gang of pick and shovel artists. When he got
back to Graham’s that night, the strains of a
mouth-organ floating in from the kitchen told him
that Cam McMaster was happy again.
Later, he learned with mixed feelings that
Cam’s trip to Boerland was off. He was going to
remain at Brulong and marry Laur i. For fear of
accidents the boundary-rider wanted the knot tied
without delay.
Dinan went over to the pub, thinking deeply
on the ways of woman. Though he had schemed
to bring the young people together he was shocked
at the girl’s callousness. Was it his duty to tell
the man the truth, or should he advise the girl to
do so?
Before he decided he was comfortably drunk.
The wedding came off very soon. Parson Smith
came out, and the ceremony took place at the
Graham domicile. Graham did the thing hand-
somely, and spared no expense to give Laura a
fitting send-off. Dinan was best man, and had
the best thirst at the festive board. In fact, so
dry was he that he found it necessary to visit the
Tanksinkers’ Arms when Graham’s supply ran
short.
At the hotel he received a shock that sobered
him. The coach had just arrived, and from it
jumped a passenger who greeted Dinan with a
shout of recognition. Open-mouthed, Dinan gazed
at the man.
“ You ! ” he gasped at last.
“ Yes, me ! ” cried Joe Otway. “ What about
it?”
Denny had no coherent reply to make.
“I’ve come back to square up a few trifles,” said
Joe, “ and to see Laura.”
“Go away, mahn ; it’s too late ye are. Th’
gir-rl’s a wife this very day ! ” shouted Dinan
“Wife! What do y’r mean?” demanded Joe.
“She was to marry me at Easter.”
“ How c’d she, an’ ye wid a wife beyant? It’s
bigamy ye’d be after committin’.”
“Bigamy me foot! Who said I was married?”
“You used to send money to yer ould woman,
so ye said,” protested Dinan weakly.
“My mother ! ” cried Joe. “ A.nd did you put
it about that I was a married man, you infernal
old drinking scoundrel ? I’ll break your d——
neck. I’ll ”
“Aisy now,” murmured Dennis, backing away
from the angry blacksmith. “ What did ye slope
f’r, inyhow, an’ niver a line to th’ gir-rl or ”
“ I got a letter to say the mother was ill and to
come home at once. I just had time to catch the
coach, an’ I rushed off. I’m no good at writin’, so
I never bothered, expectin’ to be back pretty
quick an’ explain t’ Laura, an’ now, through your
. d d interference, I’ve lost her. Why, a man
ought t’ break ”
“Aisy now,” again entreated the navvy, as he
retreated further. “It was f’r th’best I spoke.
Th’ wrong ye did, th’ trouble th’colleen was
“ What! ” yelled Otway. “ Wrong ! Trouble !
What are y’ cornin’ at ? ”
“I thought th’ poor child had gone th, way av
many another,” mumbled Denny, “an fr th
sake av th’ ould folks I—l —brought back th ould
swateheart t’ make an honest ”
“Listen ! ” hissed Otway, seizing Dinan by the
clothes promiscuously, and tearing them. I m
no deceiver of women. The girl was as honest
when I left her as if I’d never met her. I loved
that girl, Dinan, if you know what that means,
you miserable, evil-minded, drunken old
Words failing, the blacksmith s fist crashed into
Dinan’s face. The navvy fell, but rose_jnj>Muix
and waded in. In the midst of a cloud of oust, a
gory battle raged for a few short minutes. There
was little to choose between the combatants, but
the Tanksinkers’ Arms was a jerry-built house,
and while L)ennis and Joe waged a fairly equal
battle, the public-house was rapidly going to
pieces. Tracey, the landlord, and the ten local
hard-drinkers'tore the warriors apart.
Then Joe Otway left the premises with a curse
—this time for good. And the local Chinaman
remains unpaid to this day.
ARTHUR WRIGHT.
The Ballad of Skardo Khan.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Indian frontier tribes are now so well armed that
the casualties in their quarrels have lately increased by
100 per cent. A recent sale of obsolete weapons in one
of the Oversea States—Australia, it is said —is responsible
for this. The whole consignment, includin'!: an old field-
gun, was bought up by some keen Asiatic speculator and
smuggled across, via the Persian Gulf, into Afghanistan,
and thence to the back-door of our frontier tribes. The
Standard op Empire {London).
OF Skarclo Khan the ballad is sung—of the
tall Sikh havildar
Who had served the Queen when he was
voung, ere he trailed to lands afar !
For his bearded face the Barrier knew —with
camels of dismal brown
He had tramped his ways since ’ninety-two tid
the year gone freshly down.
He had toiled and saved, had Skardo Khan
though a fighting Sikh was he ;
There’s many an Indian fighting man seeks fortune
over-sea !
He had toiled and saved till yester-year, when
the chance of Skardo came :
To-day, on the far North-West Frontier, his field-
gun spits its flame !
’Tis a simple tale of pounds and pence—of a
chance that Skardo saw ;
Likewise of a Minister of Defence whose word
was sometimes law !
If you turn the page of an old Gazette, in Aus-
tralia’s year ’OB,
You will see the words —you may see them yet—
that were big with the tribesmen’s fate !
“For Sale,” were the words that Skardo scanned,
“one field-gun charging shell;
Eight hundred old Martinis, and their bayonets
as well.”
’Twas the useless stuff we were clearing out—our
Minister’s broom was new ;
But Skardo leaped with a Pagan shout where the
Day Dawn mulga grew !
The guileless day of the tenders came ; the Minis-
ter signed assent ;
There was Skardo’s bid (in a German name); for
a song the field-gun went!
And the old Martinis—hear them clang where the
fierce Afridis peer ;
For the song that Skardo’s savings sang, they were
bartered yester-year;
They were shipped to the Gulf as merchandise—as
cargo f.o.b. ;
Yea, Skardo’s coin had paid their price, and his
eyes bulged out with glee !
For the tribesmen’s wars had kindled new—’twas
a question of rupees ;
And the scheme that Skardo had in view was a
scheme that brought him fees.
In the distant West—the wild North-West beyond
old Peshawar—
He had fought (God wots of the medalled breast
' of the war-worn havildar);
So he dragged his goods from Australia’s shore to
the land of the Kambar Khels—
To the crags where the ancient Sniders roar and
the Mohmand tribesman yells.
Who knows of the far Kajuri Plain? Who wots
of its grazing rights ?
There the Kambar Khels have left the stain of
their blood in a hundred fights.
Who wots of the ancient border feuds—of the
fierce Orakzai’s ways,
Where the gorged vulture calmly broods by the
corpse that the Snider slays ?
The Viceroy dwells on Simla’s hills, where the
cooling punkahs fan ;
But the tribesman’s heart with a rapture thrills as
he plugs at his fellow-man !
There’s peace in the Punjab off and on ; no storms
disturb Bengal;
But the Mohmand argues pro and con. with a gun
from his fort’s mud wall!
So our old Martinis clang to-day in the hands of
the Zakka Khels;
And the bright rupees flow Skardo’s way—his
purse to bursting swells !
He has sold our cast-off bay’nets, too—they shine
’neath India’s sun ;
But he gathers a Rajah’s revenue with Australia’s
old field-gun !
They take their turn on the far Frontier—these
tribes of the fighting breed ;
When they pay for the cheerful cannoneer, then
Skardo swaps his creed !
The Mohmands hired him yester-noon—and now
the Kambar Khels ;
He’ll blaze for the bland Afridis soon with hurt-
ling scrap-iron shells !
He bangs away at the Mohmand’s fort with rusty
five-inch nails
Till the tribesmen weep—till the chiefs exhort,
and curse their old jezails !
The fort that he blazed from yester-morn, it is
Skardo’s mark to-day;
He expounds this Truth with his field-gun worn— L
You Must Make Your Fighting Pay !
But there is grief on Simla’s hills, and the
Viceroy writes to say
That the blood of the tribesman largely spills
since Skardo came that way !
But the tribesmen take a different view—they
urge that it pleases them ;
’Tis a joy sublime and a rapture new to hire that
gun pro tern.!
So the Border feuds go raging on, whilst Skardo’s
missiles rain—
He argues gravely pro and con.'on the old Kajuri
Plain !
What odds to Bull if the heathen fight on a new
swashbuckling plan;
Why should they mourn for their heart’s delight—
the cannon of Skardo Khan ?
VICTORIA.

Mr. J. Williams, of Northern Sta-
tion, N. E. Port Augusta, sends his
photo and writes that he has been a
sufferer from impure blood and indi-
gestion, with pimples on his face, and
blackheads. He was always taking
medicines of some kind, with no re-
lief until he began with Ayer’s Sar-
saparilla and Ayer’s Pills. He took
in all three bottles of the Sarsaparilla
■and two bottles of the Pills, with the
result that the pimples and black-
heads disappeared and he was relieved
entirely of his indigestion.
AYER’S 8 arsaparilla
acts directly upon the blood-forming glands of the body, stimulating them to
produce healthy, rich, red blood ; the kind of blood that brings a good whole-
some color to the lips and cheeks, clearing away pimples and blackheads.
As now made, Ayer’s Sarsaparilla contains no alcohol. Be
sure that you get “AYER’S,” not some worthless imitation.
Take Ayer's Pills with Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. One aids the other

Familiar Quotations
pregnant with meaning are being handed down from one generation to
another. Many examples might be quoted, and their applicability to the
subject of health noted. For example, “Forewarned is forearmed.’’
Directly symptoms of a disordered Stomach appear, that is “the warning,”
and all the “arming” that is necessary is a box of Beecham’s Pills.
“A stitch in time saves nine.” Beecham’s Pills will quickly arrest any
disposition to Stomach, Liver, or Kidney trouble.
“Worth a Guinea a Box”
This is another familiar quotation but applying specially to Beecham’s
Pills. These enjoy a popularity that can be claimed by no other
preparation: and the last named expression has become proverbial
because thousands of people all over the world have benefitted by the
use of the medicine to which it refers. For really buoyant health—free-
dom from ache or pain—a system attuned alike to work or pleasure—take
Beechams Pills.
