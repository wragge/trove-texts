BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.”
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few—the more
stoical among us —can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be'found to
have a small quantity in stock.
Wrinkles, anil Hol\v to Remove them.—Worry,
late hours or the passing- of old Father Time
may cause those ugly little lines which so
detract from the freshness and charm of a
woman’s" face; bat the cure is always the
same. Feed the tissues beneath the skin, and
massage them with a reliable skin food, which,
while nourishing the fatty tissues, will not
coarsen the skin nor grow hairs upon the
face, as so many inferior creams do. To
remove the wrinkles, bathe the face with hot
water, wipe it. dry, then, while, it is still
warm, smear a little mercolized wax over the
whole face, carrying it well down on the neck,
and, with the tips of the fingers, rub it gently
into the pores, working in an upward and
outward direction. Wipe off any superfluous
wax. leaving a little on the skin all night.
In the morning wash off. with warm water
and Pilefiia soap. The use of the wax not
only feeds the skin, but removes the dead
outer cuticle, giving the fresh young skiu
beneath an opportunity, to breathe and show
itself.
Beautiful Hair—How to Shampoo.-—Whether
the hair is luxuriant and glossy, or thin and
lanky, depends very largely upon the care
bestowed upon it. To keep the hair in good
condition it should be shampooed once in
every two or three weeks. Before shampooing,
massage a little pure olive oil or almond oil
into the scalp, then mix one teaspoonful of
stallax granules in a cup of hot water, fill a
basin with warm water, into which the ends
of the hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax
mixture into the scalp in the usual way.
Rinse and dry by fanning with a palm fan, or
in the open air. if the weather permits. 'Should
the hair be naturally very greasy, the oil
massage should lie omitted. Stallax can be
bought at aiiy chemist's iu i (i! a rtcr - pound
sealed packages; it keeps indefinitely, and one
package contains sufficient for 25 or 30
shampoos.
A Greasy Skill and Blackheads.—Kiacklieada
are absolutely fatal to beatify, for thev give a
coarse, dirty look to the face which no cos-
metics can ever hide. The way to remove
blackheads quickly and effectively has only
recently been discovered. For many years t hose
who suffered in this way were restricted in
their diet, denied sweets and had to suffer
Other privations. Modern science has. how
ever, provided a simple, effective and quick
remedy. Dissolve one sty mol tablet in a
glass of hot water, and when the effervescence
has subsided, dip a small, soft sponge into the.
liquid and bathe the face. Leave for a few
minutes, then dry with a towel, and the black-
heads will come off. For a greasy skin bathe
the face three times a week with stymoi and
spray with cold water every morning, using a
vulcanite throat spray.
To Improve the Eyebrows and Eyelashes.—
Long, curling eyelashes make the most in-
different eyes look attractive, and while no
one can alter the color, shape or size of the
eyes, all may possess luxuriant eyelashes and
well-shaped eyebrows. To increase the growth
of the eyelashes rub a little mennaline into
the roots very gently every night. Mennaline
is a perfectly harmless and delicate pomade-
like substance which may be obtained at any
chemist’s. For the eyebrows smear a little of
the mennaline on a small soft brush, and
brush into the eyebrows in a Straight or
arched direction, according to how you wish
them to grow. A month’s treatment should
see a marked improvement.
ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.
CAIRO.—No. I am not surprised at bearing
from a reader so far away, as I get letters
from every part of the world. I expect it is
the heat that lias caused you to put on weight
so rapidly, and can quite understand how
much it adds to your age. Get a small quan-
tity of elynol berries and eat one after each
meal. They will permanently reduce your
weight, are quite harmless, and you need
make no alteration in your diet.
QUEEN BESS.—Thirty is far too young to
have grey liairs. and you must not allow the
trouble to increase. Get two ounces of tamma-
lite. mix it with three ounces of bay rum. and
apply to the hair with a small, soft sponge.
This will restore the grey and fading hair to
its original color.
your muddy-looking skin
get a tin of mercolised wax and rub a little
well into the face and neck every night. Leave
on till morning, then wash off, using Pilenta
soap and warm water. This will remove the
dead outer skin and leave the complexion soft,
fresh and smooth.
JESSIE. —To remove the hairs from the lip
and chin get an ounce of powdered pheminol
and use as directed. Then apply tekko paste
several times daily for some weeks. This com-
bined treatment will permanently remove all
trace of hair from your face.
EKECKI.EE LASS.— To prevent the freckles
from appearing use a cleminite lotion. Get an
ounce of cleminite and mix it with four ounces
of warm wafer, allow to cool, then dab over
the face. This will not only protect the skin
from sunburn and freckles, but will give it a
dainty fresh look far superior to the bloom
imparted by' the finest powder. , [3

Rexine
—the perfect leather substitute.
Looks like leather but is better in every way. It wears better
and never becomes shabby, as being impervious to atmos-
pheric action it never peels or cracks. It is stain and grease
proof, and can be made like new by simply washing with soap
and water. A Rexine-covered suite has all the beauty of
leather upholstering without any of its disadvantages, and its
cost is only one quarter that of leather.
Do away with unhygienic, dust-collecting fabric upholsterings
and insist upon having Rexine.

Sole Makers * REXINE Ltd., Hyde, nr. Manchester, England.
Maker's of bags, suit cases, fancy goods, slippers etc., and bookbinders who are j

saving and give greater satisfaction.

Two Emperors and a Ghost
If tlie two Kaisers are sent to St. Helena
to end tlieir bloodstained days they will in
a ghost there that will bid at least one of
them (Karl) to keep his cloven feet off the
grass and not to defile a great tradition with
his squalid presence. For the wraith of
Napoleon has a score to settle with the Haps-
burgs.
lie was an extensive, conqueror, but every
monarch he pulled down was a tyrant, and
every Government he pulled down was far
worse than the one he set up. The tyrants
he ejected were mostly. replaced after his
fall, and when the peoples had time to fully
realise how bad they were by comparison
with the Italian usurper they rose against
them unanimously. They were wonderfully
unanimous. Namileon was no destroyer o
cities or slayer of peaceful folk, and he built
great things in the wake of his armies in-
stead of making a desert.
It was largely through German and Aus-
trian influence that he was made Emperor
of Elba after his first fall in ISI4. This
was by way of a Hun joke. Previously
Elba had been a casual little island belong-
ing to Tuscany, and hardly worth plunder*
ing. Now it was set up as a separate Stale-
and told to defend itself. The Moorish
pirates who plied their trade in the Mediter-
ranean even then promptly fixed an eye on
it. It had become really worth plundering.
The chief prize was an emperor, and they
reckoned that liis many friends- in France
would subscribe a vast fortune for his ran-
som rather than have their idol sold as a
slave in Morocco. There were a few other
persons with Napoleon who might be worth
a ransom. Also there was some money and
jewellery. Then the King of Spain, after
he had been restored by British power and
had.restored the Inquisition find had hanged
or imprisoned most of the reformers, ex-
plained that he was no party to the treaty
which established the Empire of Elba. He
reserved the right to capture his old enemy
and aoeoinme.date him in the bottom of a
dungeon. So Elba had to maintain an
absurdly large defence system.
Napoleon’s wife and infant son were in
Austria. The son was practically interned
there for life. As regards the wife,- her
proud parent, the Emperor of Austria,
either by himself or in collusion with others,
conceived the idea of prostituting this
daughter of the Hapsburgs, in order to divert
her attention from her lmsband and her lost
throne in Paris. Count Neipperg, reputed
to be about the most successful and unscru-
pulous temporary husband of his day, was
attached to the weak female’s miniature
court and fulfilled all expectations. Napo-
leon’s many letters, asking that his wife and
infant son should visit him, drew a blank.
Possibly the Webster of the time lost them
in the post.
The little court at Elba was practically
starved out because no money ever arrived
on account of the pension guaranteed by the
Powers. The Emperor’s mania for road-
making and other improvements swallowed
up the cash he had brought with him. Also
the court of Elba was scared off its small
premises. The congress at Vienna was still
sitting, readjusting the map of Europe, put-
ting back all the petty tyrants on their pedes-
tals, joining Norway to Sweden and Bel-
gium to Holland by compulsion, re-arrang-
ing the division of Poland, and scheming to
suppress the South American republics. It
was suggested by member? df this congress
that the Empire of Elba should be suppressed
and Napoleon sent to St. Helena. So he
made another bid for the throne.
It, is doubtful if the Empire of the Hundred
Days would have had any better show if
the empress and her infant son had been in
Paris to suggest that there was a real
dynasty on view and not a solitary adven-
turer. Anyhow, the infant son couldn’t come,
for he was too young; also he was detained
in Austria. And the Empress certainly
didn’t want to come so that her illegitimate
child might be born in the limelight if not
in the purple.
And Napoleon finished at St. Helena. A
large cattle-shed was altered and turned into
a small dwelling for his use. After his death
it became a cattle-shed again and remained
so at latest advices. Though St. Helena
was a very small island (seven miles each
way) situated 1200 miles off the coast of
what was later German South-West Africa,
but was then Anv Nigger’s Land, there was
such a pretence of fear lest the prisoner should
escape that lie was inspected, in or about
his cattle-shed, several times daily. When
he refused to take the air, which he generally
did towards the end, an attempt was made
to view him through the window.
When Karl of Austria arrives I should
think the ghost of a much better man will
be thei-e to oppose his landing.

‘Boro Belle”: About seven years ago an
Australian journalist in London gave some
interesting information through the Red
Page, and his advice to the freelance at home
was to have a camera in his kit. I accord-
ingly studied photography, and have since
done work for nearly every illustrated paper
in the Commonwealth. I looked around at
the industries in my native town, embracing
sugar, timber, dairying, fishing, etc., and
post-card size views depicting their various
aspects were readily accepted. From ss. to
7s. 6d. each was paid, though on several
occasions both the Australasian and Syd-
ney Mail paid 10s. for single p.c. views. As
low as 2s. 6d. was forwarded by one Queens-
land paper of much tonnage, ‘since when I
have always marked a price and got it. Some
tew bad years ago 3s. 6d. was the standard
rate. The actual cost to-day of a post-card
view, without reckoning time, can be put
down at Is. Towards Christmas-time of one
year 1 made a collection of 33 views, sent
them to a Sydney publisher, who for £52
made blocks and printed in one color 4000
copies of a souvenir view-book. Within a
of their arrival I had disposed of
to various booksellers at Is. Id. each,
who in turn retailed them at Is. Gd. As the

hollow, , . , ,
With garments a-swing. hand in hand with
Apollo, ,
Comes Spring the wine-eyed, the years
profligate spender,
With rosy hands flinging lull largesse ot
splendor.
Her breath flower-fragrant with living and
laughter , ~
And loves that delight first—and count the
cost after.
Luting laughter, they pause, Proserpine and
the Sun-god.
To grace with a transient glory each dun rod
Of peach in the orchard that leans to the
hollow,
Where, as she stands threading pink blos-
soms, a swallow —
The first of the season —in fear lest she miss
him
Sweeps down —breast a-thrill when she lin-
gers to kiss him.
As a maid first unveiling white warmth to a
lover,
Each pear-blossom shyly disc-aids her brown
cover,
And, smiling to note it, our Lady of Blisses
Turns, touching a daffodil-bed with her
kisses,
Ere, breasting the creek like a green and
gold billow,
She rises to deck the slim wands of the
willow.
Now she flits, fairy-footed, where gold lights
are dappling
The grass her tread greens ’neath a gum’s
slender sapling.
There lilts she of leafing in such darling
fashion.
The sap trills a tremulous paean of passion.
And, glow’d as with thoughts of sweet love-
rites to follow.
Each branch opes her roseate tip to Apollo.

Give me to-day my share of Life’s bright

And gold, lest by to-morrow should be stilled
My eagerness to live, and the new morn
Should find me strangely sleeping.... Lest
grey clouds,
Swathing themselves about the golden hills,
Lie deep, while I. most changed of all the

Take no more heed nor see their saddened

Give me to-day the miracles of breath
And life, and the philosophy of birds.
Who ask of no to-morrow. I only know
I yearn to feast these eyes of mine and fill
The chambers of my memory and sense
With rainbowed bubbles blown of shining
airs
And scents of earth, until I am myself
A vessel filled with wine of wonderment
As is the sun in his magnificence
The golden goblet at the lips of Life!

Up above the greening grass
Sings the bird right merrily ;
Every bush and every tree
Make a green and gallant show
In the noontide’s golden glow ;
Flowers- —a fairy everyone—
Dance and twinkle in the sun !
Fairies they ! —alas, alas —
Fairies cannot cross the sea !
Woodland-folk and mountain-folk,
Dressed in pretty cloaks that wrap
Tiny limbs, with each a cap.
Green or red, or blue, or white,
Each a dimpled, dainty sprite—
Ah, they may not leave their home,
Dare the wave and cross the foam,
Though tall ships of teak and oak
Sail the seas without mishap.
Here are scented glades and tracks,
Here are ferns that interlace,
Sapling leaves that, dancing, trace
Filmy patterns on the ground
Light and warmth are all around ;
Sure, on all the earth there is
Ne’er a fairer scene than this—
Sure, and yet it something lacks—
Fairy-form and fairy-face.
Death with frozen hands and stiff
Takes and chills us icily,
Many weeping folk there be
Bowed and beaten down by pain :
Trouble with her grieving train
Goes what way she wills to go—
Ah, alas that it is so!—
Needing neither ship nor skiff
Care and trouble cross the sea.
Little folk of glade and glen,

I shall shape a shallop past
Out of dreams, and you shall come
From your home in Fairydom—
Haunted bush and ancient tree —
To this golden land with me ;
Little women, little men.
You shall cross the sea at last!
Then, beneath the glamor shed
By old love and legend’ry,
Every butterfly and bee,
Every bird and fern and flower.
Taking fairy-form, shall dower
Glade and glen, and stream and shore
With a charm not. known before;
And no more shall it be said:
“Fairies, cannot cross the sea !".

OUR DEVELOPED AND EXHAUSTED
NATURAL RESOURCES.
In one recent issue of an Australian big daily
appeared 13 allusions to the “wonderful”
or “amazing” or “unlimited” natural re-
sources of this country. They were also
called “inexhaustible.” The phrase has
become such a habit that, when the Corpora-
tion of Sydney gave a reception to a per-
fectly unimportant person who was said to
be going to the Pacific islands, an alderman
expressed the conviction that the person of
no special account would help to develop the
incredible natural resources of this country.
The giving of receptions, which presumably
cost something, is also a habit, and so con-
firmed a habit that almost anything on two
legs that is possessed of tact and push can
get one. There might have been more
people at the reception, but attention was
diverted by the official opening (with lunch)
of a garbage destructor in a small muni-
cipality. Public life in Australia reads
like a copy of the American experiences of
Martin Ohuzzlewit, junior. Some people
would almost suggest permanent disqualifi-
cation for anybody who opens anything that
hasn’t been paid, for out of our own money
or who recites that soul-destroying phrase
“our boundless natural resources.” It is
the community’s excuse for shiftlessness,
laziness, procrastination, borrowing, empty
self-confidence, baseless optimism and all
the other slipshod sins.
#.-***
The natural resources have been to a con-
siderable extent developed and used up
already. Gold gave Australia its sensa-
tional send-off. and it was a very great
resource in the days of nuggets and rich
outcrops and shallow deposits, before men
had to grind a scanty crust out of sdwt.
reefs. It has been worth about £600,000,000
in 66 years, besides an enormous quantity
never recorded. This single industry paid
£54 per inhabitant in one year of the first
great boom, which is as much as all indus-
tries put together do now, and the money
was almost entirely dug out of a fraction of
the smallest mainland State, with a mini-
mum of cost in the way of machinery. That
was in 1853. The second great boom
reached its height in 1903. There was
more gold then than in 1853 —in fact, it was
Australia’s record year. But the popula-
tion was larger and the yield was only £4 4s.
per inhabitant. This year the total out-
put promises to be the poorest for very many
years, equal to about £1 or 225. per inhabi-
tant, and the yield per ton is so scanty that
m very many cases the business doesn’t earn
its oats. A multitude of mines are merely
kept alive in a perfunctory fashion in the
hope of better things, and because the shares
are penny or threepenny gambling counters
on the Stock Exchange. In 1853 a section
of two States provided a very big output.
In 1918 six States are raked for a small one.
There are 20 times more people than in 1553
to spot the elusive indication, and 65 years’
more experience to show where there is no
hope of finding it. and £600,000,000 less of
it to find. To prevent disappointment that
great natural industry may be regarded as
developed and used up. It is 'a remarkable
fact that Australia can’t show a mile of
State railway built out of the whole wonder-
ful £600,000,000.
The public credit may also be regarded
as a developed and used-up industi'y. The
country on June 30 owed about £664,000,000,
to be increased by the current loan to over
£700,000,000. The war loans, of course,
aren’t expected to yield any cash returns.
The peace loans for permanent and repro-
ductive works (over £400,000,000) are sup-
posed to pay interest, but fail badly. They
include works like schools, lighthouses,
roads, bridges, etc., which pay nothing and
are a heavy drain for upkeep and expenses ;
also pure swindles like immigration, revenue
deficits and State aid to religion. Bor-
rowing might have gone on indefinitely if the
34 per cent, loans had earned 4 r>er cent, or
the 44 per cent, loans had yielded 5 per cent,
and the balance had been put to sinking
fund. But seeing that direct taxation has
been increased ninefold in 18 years, largely
because the pauper “reproductive” loans
have to be subsidised, the public loan in-
dustry may be regarded as about used up.
It is a curious fact that all the States sub-
sidise gold-mining now with small grants
and aids, and there is talk of paying an
all-round bonus of so much per ounce, so the
two big industries arrive at the Benevolent
Asylum together. The great natural in-
dustry of issuing, notes has been exhausted.
There will certainly be a great and per-
manent note circulation after the war. But
Australia, like practically every other
country (though not so much as some), has
pushed its issue beyond the natural demand
to provide war funds, and there will be a
lot of paper to be redeemed with coin when
things are normal again. As for the pub-
lic land-sale industry, if it could be called
one, it was a great affair once, but it is now
vei’y small. There is a growing sentiment
against selling the public estate. There
are no big coastal cities like Melbourne and
Sydney and Adelaide, and no big inland
industrial centres growing up to give a value
to the publicly-owned out-back lands; the old
Big City landowning and importing inter-
ests prevent that. And country lands at
great distances from the big scarce cities
tend to lose values, because population in
many cases is leaving.
* * 4!* *
So the remaining great natural resources
are not so very great, though people still
talk of them in the jargon of years ago, for-
getting that the jargon is quite out of date.
The known mineral resources apart from
gold are large for the population, but very,
very small for the size of the country. They
can’t be worked much faster than they are
at present unless there are more people to
work them, and consequently more people to
divide the profit. A much more urgent neces-
sity than the opening up of new mines is the
putting to some sane purpose of the goods
when they are taken out of the mines. A
mining and industrial country makes per-
haps 5 per cent, of its wealth by digging the
stuff out of the earth. The other 95 per cent,
is made by turning the ore into "ships and
engines and watch-springs and kettles and
munitions and surgical instruments and the
like, either for the community’s own use, or
to sell to other people at prices hundreds per
cent. higher than the value of the raw
material, or (as in the case of ships) to hire
out to other people at high rents. All this
creates. land values and supplies a large
population to pay taxes and share the public
debt and buy the farmer’s wheat so that it
won’t decay in Government stores financed
by loan money. There isn’t much to be
gained by developing Australia’s mineral re-
sources and eating up the irreplaceable
bowels of the country while the country only
gets the 5 per cent, end of the profit.
* * * *
As for the natural resources which grow
a new crop every year, they are not wonder-
ful except in the sense that the acreage of
the country per inhabitant is the greatest
among all the habitable lands of the earth.
One-third of Australia may be written off
as. a proposition to be considered when the
rain-making art is in better working order.
All the jargon that was. ever invented as an
excuse for floating another loan can do little
with a warm region that has no known arte-
sian supplies of good water and possesses
a rainfall of from ],oin. down to none at all.
And seeing that the balance of the country
provides nearly a square mile to each pair
of people, the dry region may be postponed
for the present. In the wet lands, or rather
those parts which are damp enough for
wheat-growing, bar occasional droughts, a
good average yield is one-third that of
Britain, Denmark, Holland or Belgium, and
less than half that of Canada, Sweden and
some other countries. That is to say, the
Australian farmer has to cultivate three
times as much land as the John Bull farmer
or more than twice as much land as the
Canadian one to grow a similar crop. Con-
sidering that he has to send his surplus grain
the longest possible distance to a market in-
stead of selling it to a Birmingham or Man-
chester in the next county, and has to bring
much of his plant and groceries from the
other end of the world instead of buying
them next door, he probably requires to cul-
tivate five times as much land as some of his
competitors to make a good living. There is
a limit to the area which one man can cul-
tivate. Space is certainly a great asset, and
elbow-room is a glorious thing, but it is
little profit after all to have 20.000 acres of
land awaiting each cultivation if he can only
cultivate 500 at the most. There are great
possibilities, especially in parts of the tropi-
cal belt, but the general situation is that
Australia requires more people than most
countries and far more than some countries
to work it as an agricultural proposition,
because the farmer has to cover more ground
than most farmers for every bushel he reaps,
and he isn’t a locomotive or a Melbourne
Cup winner any more than his reptile con-
temporary abroad. Therefore the only hope
of raising anything specially affluent in the
way of an agricultural population outside the
limited choice regions lies in cutting out the
vast distances by bringing the consumer to
our doors. And that means the end of the
Foreign-trade and importing and One Big
City policy.
In its best days th© gold industry, which is
now nearly defunct, paid a subsidy equal to
£5 per annum for every square mile of Aus-
tralia. The loan expenditure—largely the
expenditure of imported money—for a num-
ber of recent years was equal to £7 for every
square mile, including the desert and the
salt lakes, or more than £1 per acre of the
cultivated area and the area occupied by
towns. The paper-money issue was a material
donation per acre to every place, includ-
ing the wilderness where Leichhardt's
bones lie. These weren’t looked upon as
subsidies to industry, but the dissipation of
loan moneys throughout the land subsidised
everything more or less. Setting these down
as practically exhausted resources, Australia
may consider itself as a big and very plain
sort of country making a fresh start with a
hideous debt to pay, and a lot of profligate
habits and delusions to get rid of. The worst
delusion is that, in some way, its great area
and its blank spaces and its past will pro-
vide it with a square meal.
PULLING THE LEG OF FRANCE.
The French Mission will depart, with one
leg much longer than the other owing to it
being pulled so extensively by Australian
politicians. The visitors were shown all the
remarkable nice things that could be shown
in the time. They saw the well-kept main
railways where the fast, well-equipped trains
run and the smattering of population doesn’t
smatter so poorly as in most places. They
had revealed to them the costly fittings and
upholsterings of the Jenolan Caves, and they
wondered if it was a pantomime or an Ara-
bian Night. The Yanco reservoir was
pointed out with e v ii air which suggested that
we had reservoirs to burn, and the visitors
were impressed and said it was a marvellous
achievement for a young country. Not a soul
mentioned to them that no single item of
these things is paid for ; that in fact there is
a debt (a peace debt or debt built up by lazi-
ness, cowardice, shirking and incapacity and
quite apart from war liabilities) of between
255. and 30s. on every £1 of the value of the
works. Coming from a country which is
accustomed to pay its way, and which doesn’t
borrow from outside capitalists for its roads
and bridges, they apparently took things for
granted. So they complimented Australia on
its amazing works without realising that they
aren’t our works in any sense, and our poli-
ticians swallowed the compliment and beamed
like the cat that has just eaten a baby fowl.
* * * *
The Frenchmen even went so far as to sug-
gest that this great rich country might buy
more from France, and nobody told them that
this is the one big white man’s country out-
side the zone of war destruction in which
exports—the things with which we pay for
imports—despite high prices, are actually less
in value than they were before the war. It
wasn’t even hinted that, while the United
States and Canada have taken the chance to
multiply their sales fourfold inside four
years, Australia, through its failure to build
ships, through its “Go Slow” policy, its pro-
Hun agitators and its utter loss of self-
reliance by reason of the loan disease couldn’t
even pay for the greatly-reduced quantity of
goods it bought last year without borrowing
many millions of money. The Frenchmen
were sent away with the idea that they had
struck an affluent friend instead of an im-
poverished Micawber. The old Foreign-
trade gang of liars and parasites, of course,
promptly pasted the advt. of their chiffon
business on the occasion. They absolutely
wept about our ingratitude towards a gallant
ally because we have bought little from
France and sold much to it, while with the
beastly Hun, until the war came, things were
the other way about. And it has been so,
thanks to a wicked crowd of importers,
backed by Freetraders and Freetrade
papers. In the last year of peace this coun-
try bought over £7,000,000 worth of manu-
factured goods from the Hun, who pur-
chased only some raw materials, mostly
munition-making materials, for an old
song; while the importers took only about
£2,000,000 worth from France. But, on the
whole, and the whole is what matters, the
tariff was so inefficient as compared with that
of France, Germany, Canada and the U.S.,
that Australia, in the last year of peace,
bought more than it sold, and had to pay for
the surplus and all the vast interest on its
external debts with new loans. The weeping
sharks of Foreign-trade are urging that the
tariff should be lowered so that we may buy
more from France and give a distressed and
gallant ally a leg up—not the leg that was
pulled, but the other one. They know, of
course, that we can’t lower the tariff in the
case of France without also lowering it in
the case of other countries—possibly includ-
ing Germany, Austria, Bulgaria and Turkey
after the peace—for there are strict limits on
the preferential treaty business. We can’t
buy much more from France than we do
unless France lends us the money to pay for
the goods, and perhaps, after investigating
our debts and deficits, France would rather
keep the goods. Some things we might have
done for the Ally which mobilised its
last man and its last shilling in the
first hour of the war—we might have
helped with the necessaries of strife
and eased the terrible strain on a coun-
try which was enrolling its young chil-
dren and its old grandfathers in the munition
factories.
* * * *
Canada furnished £58.000.000 worth of
slaughter appliances in a single year.
Australia might have helped by build-
ing ships, but it didn't. It might have fur-
nished the hungry Allies with wheat, but it
failed miserably because it couldn’t lay its
hands on the required ships and because of
the policy of importing ships instead of build-
ing them. Australia, which digs gold out of
the ground, might have lent a little money
instead of crowding into a loan market which
was already overcrowded for funds to con-
struct scraps of railway with. Having failed
in all these directions, and in addition having
sent Hughes to lecture the Allies about
how things should be done, it is piling mock-
ery on top of injury to propose helping
France by buying a lot of its goods and
giving an lOU for them. The one redeeming
feature of the sorry business has been the
magnificent.—almost unique—courage of the
men whom the country didn’t send to the
Front in its national capacity, for they were
all volunteers, and the country didn't pay
them. J. Bull paid them, and, provided he lends
Australia the money to repay him with, he
expects to be repaid in time. If he doesn’t
get his bill settled in time there is all eternity
to follow, barring the bit of eternity that has
already expired. Eternity, like the Aus-
tralian gold output, is being used up very fast.
And Eternity isn’t on the price-fixing iist.
THE MAN WITH THE ALLEGED HOE.
Dear Bulletin, —The seventh annual con-
ference of the Australian Telegraph and
Telephone Construction and Maintenance
Union is clearing the decks for action in
Melbourne. And on the notice-board of the
concern with the long name and the imported
materials appears the usual, inevitable, in-
variable proposition about —
merging into one great union ns a. combine to dis-
pose of the whole of the Australian workers’ only
commodity —THElß TOIL.
I suppose with a certain type of diseased or
despondent mind this wallowing in grief and
carefully cultivated degradation is inevitable.
Why Labor should hire alleged leaders to
state in public that it has no brains or skill
to dispose of I don’t know. The constant
boast of these insulting clowns is that the
mass of the people are mere animals, hunks
of meat, tame gorillas, soulless clods, who
may revolt and do damage, but who must
always be clods —undeveloped children to be
patronised and patted on the head and
taught their political ABC by blatant
writers of manifestoes. The noisiest and con-
sequently the best-advertised of these men
may be of a very moderate order of intelli-
gence, but they hold their places so long as
they can persuade others that they (the
others) have less intelligence or no intelli-
gence at all. The man who leads a bear at
the end of a rope may be of very little men-
tal value, but as long as he know’s more than
the bear, or can persuade the hear that he
does, his position is secure. Incidentally he
has to convince the animal that he is a bear.
* * * *
Probably the job of being a wharf-laborer
is about as uninspiring and as dreary as any-
thing can be. There are abundance of dreary
jobs which are an apprenticeship to some-
thing better. The farm or station “hand” is
at least learning a business at which he may
start for himself in a small way, and become
his own master even if he is his own entire
staff at first. In pretty nearly every skilled
trade a man can become his own master in
a small way; it is impossible for anybody to
be his own master in a big way, for that
necessitates a large “wage slave” class. Thus
in_N. S. Wales, poor as it is in skilled indus-
tries, there were, according to the latest
returns; .1524 “factories” (out of a total of
5856), which employed on an average less
than three “wage-slaves” apiece, and at that
rate the opportunities of the wage-slave to
become a master are pretty extensive. He
doesn’t need to soar into the capitalistic
class to make a beginning, and with a tariff
which encouraged local industries his oppor-
tunities would be still better. As for other
lines of employment, an editor and news-
paper proprietor often begins by being a
copying-machine, taking down the words of
soulless orators, and a successful politician
may begin even lower than that. Then the
chances for co-operative industry are un-
limited. And every human being in Aus-
tralia has at least the luck to begin life as a
landowner (a part owner of the unsold pub-
lic estate), as a banker (a shareholder in
the Commonwealth Bank and the State Sav-
ings Bank) and as a railway magnate, inso-
far that he will be part owner of thousands
Oj. _ miles of railway when the mortgage is
paid off. Also he is joint autocrat or em-
peror of the Northern Territory, Papua and
Canberra; and something of a shipowner,
manufacturer and other things.
* * ■* #
Still, as I was saying, the wharf-laborer
stands conspicuously as a representative of
a class which is hopelessly in the “wage-
slave” category, apart _ from his banking,
railway, land, shipowning and other inter-
ests and unless he co-operates to own
wharves and ships. Therefore the wharf-
laborer should be greatly reduced in num-
bers, so that his job wouldn’t be a life job,
unless he wanted it to be. but merelv an epi-
sode in his career—the sort of thing that
may happen to any man some time or an-
other. There is no reason why so much wooi
or wheat or ore should be dragged by animal
toil on board ships. These things might be
made up here by skilled men, who would be
much nearer the status of the artist than is
the shore-side bearer of burdens, and who
would have a better chance of rising in the
world. As for the wholesale dragging of the
costly products of highly-skilled employment
off the ships, while the “wage-slaves” who
do the labor are becoming responsible for an
ever increasing public debt to pay for them,
it is wholly pathetic. If Benvenuto Cel-
lini had been born in the same atmosphere
of debt, importation and carefully-cultivated
despair, he would probably have been a
lumper loading bags of crude ore on a ship,
instead of being a marvellous worker in rare
metals —and incidentally the most pictu-
of his day.
The _ whole policy of the importing and
tariff-sinking and development-of-the-great-
natural-industries crowd is to confine the larg-
est possible proportion of Australians to the


least skilled and, in a degree, purely routine
and animal employments. It suits the Tory
who believes in having a working-class which
has nothing but its toil to dispose of. It
suits the loud-mouthed “agitator,” who is
merely an agitator and not a constructor,
because his existence depends on the posses-
sion of an audience which can be persuaded
that it is less intelligent than himself. Also,
there must be a class which can be persuaded
that it is oppressed without hope of deliver-
ance, except through his leadership, else lie
couldn’t lead. Even a big Moses can’t
guide the people out of bondage in Egypt
and dump them into a promised land, which
made them almost weep for its barrenness,
unless he can first persuade them they
are in bondage and that they are in Egypt.
And a small Moses must persuade very
hard, even to get the oppressed folk to New
Australia in Paraguay, which was really a
land of promise, though something went
Wrong. The aim of every intelligent and
ambitious nation is to get a hold on the most
skilled and most profitable industries and the
ones, like shipowning, which confer power;
and to reduce the dead-end and beast-of-
burden industries to a minimum. It doesn’t
believe in having a slave-class which has no
chance to rise, except by insurrection; nor
even a perfectly free class with the fullest
possible share of political power and with
the law-making industry in its hands, which
has been deluded into the belief that it is a
slave horde anti has no hope except by rising
against its own laws and standing its own
political system on its head.
In this connection it is worth while to
note that Australian statistics, which are
about as complete and reliable as any others
in the world, set down the value of every-
thing produced in Australia in 191 G (latest
figures) at £270,427,000. That didn’t include
loan money, either borrowed here or abroad,
the printed bonds that are given to people
in exchange for loan money, and which look
like wealth, but are merely what we owe. to
ourselves; the paper-money printed during
the year; the new land values created by
booms in suburban allotments or by buying
land at high prices to put returned soldiers
on, or any other figments.' It was simply the
value of things produced, some of them at
high war-prices. From that had to be de-
ducted £7G.228,000 to pay for expensive im-
ported goods, most of which we might have
made ourselves, leaving £194.199,000. From
that again had to be deducted about
£20,000,000 (possibly more) for interest on
State and Federal debts and interest and
dividends on investments contracted outside
Australia. This was money payable in gold,
not paper: and unlike the interest on local
debts it quitted the country and ceased to
be part of the country’s assets. That left
£174,199.000, which represented £35 11s.. or
thereabouts, per inhabitant, or nearly £l7B
(say £3 9s. per week) for an average family
of five —husband, wife, three live children
and possibly a dead one. These figures fur-
nish a basis to start with in calculating pos-
sible wages, apart from paper values, which
are often temporary and fictitious. It would
be a better basis if there were less foreign
debts to pay for, and less foreign imports,
largely representing the highly skilled labor
that we haven’t got to pay for. As things
are it doesn’t look much of a basis. There
are several better ones in the world, but
they belong to countries which don’t import
so much and which haven’t been so heavily
pawned by their Labor party and others to
the outside capitalist.—Yours, etc., Henky
Hobsecoixak.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
About Webster’s Ships.
Postmaster- General Webster writes: —
’Tis strange to note the inconsistency of The
Bulletin, the paragon of economy, when, by admit-
ting the truth, a little credit may possibly ensue. I
realise the latter is anathema to a journal of such
exalted principles. Nearly every second article is
one condemning Ministers for ineptitude and extrava-
gance. Only when they demand from the Post Office
something for nothing do they excel in their incon-
sistency, as illustrated by their dissertation on “Web-
ster's Ships” in last issue. Fools rush in where angels
fear to tread, and so The Bulletin, in its wisdom,
condemns me because I am not fool enough to waste
the people’s money on a project which, from an Aus-
tralian standpoint, is at present outside the bounds
of a practical business proposition. With labor and
material at famine prices, and all money available
being wanted for the war, one is surprised at the
reckless advice coming from such a source. Yet we
have another example in a further paragraph in the
same issue, wherein they practically contend that I
should expend public money to provide storage room
for dutiable parcels, of much bulk, now arriving in
vast quantities. Such would doubtless relieve the
space in the warehouses, but it would congest and
stagnate the postal service, whilst adding much
expense with no additional compensation. The time
allotted before demurrage is chargeable on such
parcels was, after conference with the Chamber of
Commerce, admitted' as fair. Before the advent of
war-time mercantile parcels, 14 days was allowed,
which was unwarrantable in peace time, but intoler-
able under war conditions. Yet The Bulletin, which
howls for economy, urges me to adopt so costly and
suicidal a policy. Yet another paragraph belittles
enlistment in the postal service. Such is a slander
on the effort put forward, whereby some 4000 men of
the service have joined the A.I.F. The Department now
has to exercise caution, so that the service may go
on. Evidently The Bulletin thinks even indispen-
sable men should be enlisted. Many who could ill
be spared have already gone, until the danger-line
has been reached. Of course The Bulletin, ever
ready to cast a stone, would prefer to undermine
the efficiency of the service, and so justify its
abnormal desire to condemn even those who foolishly
obey its bidding.
In reply whereunto :
In the matter of “Webster’s Ships” The Bulletin
didn’t intend that its valued friend the P.M.G.
should spend money on airships as mail and passen-
ger carriers. It rather suggested that the reasons he
advanced as showing an air service to be impossible
were mullock, and it begged him not to lose hope as
well as bags, but to keep his head lifted like the
chanticleer at dawn. The proposition was that the
airship-builder or sky-architect shouldn’t be too fast,
and start before he was out of bed. Also that he
shouldn’t be too slow, for a lot of money might be
lost by not being faster, seeing that costly and pos-
sibly obsolete railways are being built all the time.
In other words, while regarding Webster’s argument
as less than useless it urged him to strike a happy
medium. And it only meant him to do that in his
mind. The Bulletin merely addressed Webster be-
cause he spoke first, as he usually does. The real job
should be done by the Works Department, and the
money might be found by recalling the Commissioner
to the United States, cabling to Hughes and Cook
that their globe-trotting expenses are cut off, and,
if necessary, selling Australia House. This paper
admits that it has got into the habit of blaming
Webster for almost anything, because Webster
writes to the papers about almost everything. The
P.M.G.’s statement that The Bulletin, in its issue of
3/10/’lB, “belittles enlistment in the postal service”
anti is a slander on the efforts put forward makes
this paper weary of Webster. Recently a para-
graph nearly got in which blamed Webster
for building the Pyramids, and that was entirely
his fault, for if he hadn’t written to the daily press
about the Pyramids he forgot about it. This explana-
tion is tendered in a friendly spirit, for The Bul-
letin always enjoys reading Webster’s works, which
already exceed in size those of his talented name-
sake.

Hughes Bucking-up the German.
Unless the cable people and reporters are
turning sour on him Hughes seems to have
nothing better to do in the vicinity of Lon-
don than jump up every five minutes and
announce that a bale of wool will never
again be shipped from Australia to Ger-
many. There may possibly be some point in
talk of this sort. The trouble is to find it.
Taken generally the only possible effect of
howling about an intention to fight for a
peace based on “withholding all supplies of
material from Germany” must be to assist
the Kaiser in deluding his tortured people
about the character of the war and the arms
of the Allies. If there is any advantage in
doing this then Hughes appears to be the
right man in the right place. If there is
not, the time for decorating Hughes with a
muzzle seems to be more than ripe. Inci-
dentally it may be pointed out that while
Hughes is yelling about “raw materials”
President Wilson is laying down a peace
policy which repudiates the Hughes yell
from beginning to end, and rests upon per-
suading the German people that they have
nothing to lose and everything to gain by
bringing the war to an end. The third of
Wilson’s “Fourteen Points” of a world
peace is this: —•
The removal as far as possible of all economic
barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade
conditions among all the nations consenting to a
world peace and associating themselves for its
maintenance.
Against this —which Wilson makes clear
must be contingent upon reparation and
restoration by Germany— Hughes puts the
amendment of —
No Australian wool ever to go to Germany again.
It is an impractical and futile hope.
If our wool does not get there directly
it will indirectly. Wilson has not
formulated a Point about “No cotton
for Germany.” nor another Point about
“P»oycotting Hamburg.” The essence of
the peace to which he invites the German
is one resting on peaceful relations—minus
Hohenzollerns in shining armor. The peace
Hughes wants is apparently one loaded with
all the materials for an early burst-up after-
wards. “Raw material” has become such an
obsession with him that, he cannot even think
of the possibility of Australia, being any-
thing else than a place selling something
raw. To the imperative necessity for this
country to get into the habit of manufactur-
ing from its raw materials he remains as
blind as a bat. If he could manage to do
something practical for Australian industries
he would have less time to blow off hot air
about industries with which he has no more
to do than the man in the moon —and never
will have.
A Beast with Universal Suffrage.
Tiie Hun, ’by reason of his inhuman vanity
and his illimitable belief in the mental
inferiority of other races, is a poor liar,
lie was a more convincing sample in Bis-
marck’s day, for Bismarck wore an out-
ward semblance of rugged honesty, and he
spoke for the people for so many years that
he became the voice of the people. In other-
words, his shagginess became their shaggi-
ness. But even the Bismarck-Huii in-
spired little faith, and the race has
degenerated since his day. The modern
German is a coarse liar; a loud-mouthed,
bullying, unashamed, bear-like liar; a suc-
cessful liar when he has his mailed fist in
working order to back him up; but a
polished, feasible, convincing prevaricator,
never. He always suggests a hog trying to
be a hypocrite. His new mouthpiece, the
Chancellor of Peace and Freedom, is Prince
Max of Baden, one of the old standard type
of royalities, poorly disguised in the cloak
of liberalism and the whitewash of de-
mocracy. In propounding his utterly insane
scheme for the cessation of hostilities, he
included not one item that had the faintest
approach to apology or reasonable repara-
tion. In fact, he rather asked for conces-
sions than offered them. And he put in a
clumsy and uncouth jest which revealed his
mental calibre. He attempted to tickle
the sensibilities of ignorant democrats and
pacifists and Perth Conference men by
promising “immediate universal suffrage” in
Prussia and other German States. No one
will ever find out what connection there is
between the Allies’ demand on one side for
complete reparation and for the breakage of
the military machine which, bv its terror-
ism, has made Europe a hell for 60 years,
and, on the other side, the proposition of
universal local suffrage in Prussia and
Meeklenburg-Schwerin and Saxe-Altenburg.
The State Governments of these places can’t
make war or peace or tariff's or anything
else that concerns us. A promise of uni-
versal suffrage in Sheol would be just as
much to the point. It is a purely Hun idea
to bid for the sympathy of the ignorant by
the pretence that, if they aid the collapse
of the Allies and consent to leave Serbia
and Montenegro and Roumania and such-,
like small, crushed peoples in the lurch,
they will be helping the disfranchised
Hun brother in the upward path. The
Imperial Parliament of Germany—the
only one that concerns us —is a rather
democratic institution on paper. There is
manhood suffrage and vote by ballot for the
Lpwer Hun House, and its constituencies,,
apart from practically disfranchised Alsace-
Lorraine, are more carefully adjusted accord-
ing to population than those of Britain or
even Australia. The Lower Hun House is
distinctly ahead, on paper, of the British
Commons, and in some ways of the Legisla-
tive Assemblies of this country. The
Upper Hun House is composed of delegates
appointed by the States for one session only,
so it is far more liberal on paper than. the
British House of Lords or the nominee
Upper Houses of Queensland and N. S.
Wales. It may even claim to be, in one
respect, more theoretically democratic than
our Senate or that of the United States,
seeing that membership goes according to
population. Members of both Houses are
paid and possess that priceless emblem of
enlightenment, the free railway pass. The
Emperor can’t make war —so the theory
goes—without the assent of the Upper House
unless the country is atacked. so his power
is less on paper than that of George V., who
is authorised to declare war on all the
Powers, great and small, any morning before
breakfast or after it. The Kaiser can’t veto
any law passed by the two Hun Houses,
while George V. can veto the whole pro-
gramme of the session, but doesn’t. Wil-
liam 11. can’t even prorogue or dissolve the
People’s House without the consent of the
Upper House, and in the case of a dissolu-
tion the elections must take place inside 60
days and the new House must meet inside
90 days. This is different from the case of
George V., who is authorised to dissolve the
Commons every time he sees it. In fact, the
Kaiser is quite a limited person according
to documentary evidence, and so far as the
Lower Hun House is concerned, the people
are almost uproariously free save for one
reservation. Ministers are not necessarily
members of the Legislature, but are the
Kaiser’s appointees. Still, United States
Ministers are not necessarily members of
Congress, and they are the President’s
nominees, and liberty isn’t visibly outraged.
Yet the Hun war machine tramps along
very much as it pleases. A remarkable pro-
portion of the free populace are Gov-
ernment officials of one sort or another,
upborne by their snobbish dignity and their
tradition of “loyalty” to the Crown. A
remarkable proportion possess some second-
rate or billionth-rate title or distinction
which binds them to the ruler by gratitude
for small favors received and bv hopes of
larger ones. And all of them, bar the Poles,
the French Alsace-Lorrainers and a few
Danes, are Huns —just common or back-yard
Huns. The Reichstag is really a repre-
sentative body—that Reichstag which has
been blood-drunken for five years, and in
which hardly a voice has been raised against
rape, arson, the torture or murder or. en-
slavement of non-combatants, the merciless
brutality shown towards nrisoners, the de-
filement of churches, the plundering of the
goods of the poorest, and the sinking of
unarmed ships (often neutral ships) with
all on board. The Reichstag is the fully-
authorised hog-agent of a hog-people. It
is useless to talk about appealing from the
Kaiser and his kind to democratic Germany.
The Reichstag is the proof that there is
practically no one to appeal to except people
like the Kaiser, and they can only be appealed
to by the same arguments which apply in
his case. It has been noted that, in pro-
portion to’ population, incest is nearly 10
times as frequent in Germany as in Eng-
land ; rape about seven times as frequent;
unnatural offences about five times; procura-
tion of girls for immoral purposes about 200
times. Also, Germany is far ahead of Eng-
land in crimes of violence generally, yet
England is not exactly a land of saints. That
is the record of a very unpleasant, not to
say animal, folk. And the fact that it is
proposed, as a sort of sidelong reason why an
outraged world should make them large con-
cessions, to give these unpleasant folk more
suffrage in their State capacities, seems
irrelevant. Possibly the Political Labor
League will see some merit in the suggestion,
hut it isn’t so visible as it might be.
The Mixed Commission.
It is in the Hun order of things that Ger-
many should suddenly “accept” President
Wilson’s terms of peace—with a very im-
portant reservation, though the reservation
doesn’t look so very important at the first
glance. The President never offered terms
as the spokesman of the Alliance. In a mes-
sage to Congress he stated his idea of the
minimum conditions as matters stood then,
and Congress approved. Therefore, when
the Allies meet to consider a settlement the
proposal of the United States will be on the
table, subject to any alterations that later
Hun infamies may make desirable in Uncle
Sam’s opinion. The proposals of Britain,
France and Italy and those of the five States
—Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro, Roumania
and Russia —which have been through the
furnace and have lived in Hell, will also be
on the table. Out of all these materials
the final proposition will be evolved. The
Hun, finding that the Mailed Fist is atrophied
and debilitated, professes to regard the
President’s statement as a definite offer to
which all the Allies are bound, and which
the President must uphold even against the
other Allies. He accepts it with a plausible
reservation. By doing so he elevates Woon-
row Wilson, the man of the people, above
princes. This recognition is to afflict him
with swelled head and make him, as a man
endorsed by the Hun, cross and supercilious
and dictatorial to mere hereditary worms
like the sovereigns of Britain, Italy or Serbia.
He isn’t even to notice, in liis excitement,
that his terms haven’t been accepted—that
the reservation nullifies everything. An
essential matter in Wilson’s programme is
that the Hun shall evacuate all the foreign
territory he occupies, in France, Belgium,
Luxemburg, Italy, Serbia, Roumania, Russia
and Albania, and get inside his own borders.
Evacuation is a simple matter. Every man
evacuates his bedroom when he gets up and
evacuates his house when he goes to his
workshop or office. The Kaiser and his
Government profess, however, that it is a
very intricate affair, and suggest that a
Mixed Commission shall be appointed to de-
cide which foot the Hun will put foremost in
his retirement, and whether he shall start
for home with his chest sticking out or
sticking in. Germany, Austria and Turkey
will, of course, demand to be represented. So
will Bulgaria. So will William of Wied as
sovereign of Albania. So will the shadowy
Hun principalities which have been set up
in Russia. It will take quite a while for
the Mixed Commission to mix. Then there
will be long debate as to whether the Hun
should leave with his helmet cocked over his
left eye or his right one. All this time the
Hun is to live on the occupied territory, and
drain its resources, and recuperate his armies,
so that he may presently be strong enough
to tell the Mixed Commission to go to Sheol.
And all this time the Allied troops are not
to smite the Hun by reason of the armistice.
And all this programme is based on the theory
that Wilson, the man of the people, will be
so inflated by royal Hun recognition that he
will fall into any sort of trap. The scheme
is thin, but Hun-like.
Dear Bulletin, —The position of the Aus-
tralian landowner (mentioned in The Bulleti n
3/10/’18) is complicated, and the new taxa-
tion proposals of Watt and others don't
tend to sort out the complication. As at
June, 1917, it is mentioned, the Federal Gov-
ernment reckoned the value of all freehold
lands at £445,876,104. It did the same at
June, 1915, so at least it is consistent. Last
year the Commonwealth taxed £202,063,245
worth of this. The revenue was £2,123,778,
equal to Id. and a fraction in the £ on the
capital value of all land, including the
quarter-acre at Bobundera or the few perches
at Nyngan ; or about 2-ld. in the £ on the
land really taxed. If land yielded 5 per
cent, on its nominal unimproved value, that
meant rather over Is. lOd. in the £
on the annual value of all land, or 4s. 2d. in
the £ on the income of land actually taxed.
The amount of land-tax levied last year
by State Governments is hard to ascer-
tain, but it looks like more than
£1,000,000. It is also hard to say how much
local government taxes represent on land
pure and simple, but it looks like anything
between £1,000,000 and £2,000,000. The
Commonwealth exempts land worth less than
£5OOO unless it is held by companies. The
N. S. Wales Government exempts land worth
less than £240, and the other States are
much the same. The. municipalities don’t
exempt anything except some varieties
of pious institutions which seem to be
exempted all round. (Holy or other in-
stitutions stand for about £9,000,000 of
land values.) In our copious system of
Government land is taxed by three authori-
ties. Incomes, even if they are the precari-
ous kind that cease on the owner’s death or
incapacity, are taxed by two. Imported
luxuries by only one. When the Federal
Government published its elaborate statistics
there were 718,569 landholders. (There are
probably more now; at one recent suburban
land sale out of a good many held that day a
single holding was cut up into 110 “estates.”)
Of the 718,569 proprietors 417,571 held less
than £2OO worth each, and the Common-
wealth, which aims at breaking up big
estates rather than at revenue, didn’t think
them worth a cartridge. But even though
taxes run to 4s. or ss. in the £ on the rental
value of all land —less on small properties
and more on big ones—the jest is that most
of the great estates can’t be broken up in the
ordinary sense. I mean those that are great
in value, which is the thing that really
matters —not the average 36,000 acres of rab-
bits and duststorm in the N. S. Wales West-
ern Division or worse places. The biggest
estate I know of in N. S. Wales is quite a
kitchen-garden size, and is located in Sydney
with a very tall building squashing its vitals,
and if anybody can show me how to break
Anzac Again.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They beat us from the cliffs of Anzac back;
But further south we’ve found another track
That leads us to Gallipoli again!
But ah ! those supermen
Who in that wild adventure were o’er-
thrown —
If they could but have known!
If they who grimly paid the dreadful price.
And in their death-throes felt their sacrifice
Was vain, could have but this day foreseen,
How proud they would have been !
And they who to their death so nobly went
Would rest there, well content.
If they who, ordered from that tragic shore,
Left their dead mates with hearts depressed
and sore,
Could have but known that their revenges
willed
Would be at last fulfilled,
They would have said, “So long!” with
spirits high,
And turned without a sigh.
If they who left their mates in alien soil
Had known that nothing from us can despoil
That little city of our lonely dead —
That all the blood they shed
Has made each ordered little grass-grown
mound
Part of Australian ground !
Yet thev who in that silent city sleep
Forever faith in their oivn country keep:
Though they, it seemed, in utter failure fell,
They know that all is well.
They know a mate would not desert a mate;
His'footstep they await.
Where is Australia? Let this truth be said:
Australia is wherever lie her dead.
And that bleak town by the iEgean shore
Is ours for evermore.
Beneath the grass their souls wait for the
tread
Of eomrades overhead.
To them with victory there comes a breath-
A fragrant whisper through those lanes of
death:
The sleepers know they did not die in vain;
And they can sleep again.
Hark! From Gallipoli did you not hear
A grim and ghostly cheer?

that up for closer settlement I will be glad.
That is why I want this country to found
some new cities on good unoccupied harbors
with the State as sole ground landlord, and
inheritor of the unearned increment, and
collector of 100 per cent, land-tax. The old
cities can’t be suddenly confiscated without
wrecking every savings bank and life-insur-
ance office in the land, but there is nothing
against new ones. The profit of landlordism
lies in the unearned increment which, in a
congested fast-growing city, can keep ahead
in good times even of our three land-taxes.
Buildings, clothes, fish, etc., don't gain value
with age. Nor does ox-tongue. Land does—
with luck. But in some badly-perished towns
where there is an unearned decrement the
present taxes suffice to break up even small
estates. Sometimes rates on the allotment
are years in arrear, and when the collector
tries to collect he is told that he can seize the
estate and cut it up with an axe into mangled
fragments. But that kind of estate would
break up, anyhow.—Yours, etc., Sol M.
Uncle Sam’s Wallop.
With the German armies being rolled home
in the west and the Turk and Austrian fall-
ing to pieces in the south, and the Bolsheviks
looking on with a bloodshot eye from the
east, and winter crawling down on him
from the north. Wiliielm 11. is just about
where Brother Jonathan and Co. have been
wanting to get him. Wherefore, negotia-
tions for peace commenced last week. Up
to the time of writing they had not pro-
ceeded beyond the stage of some rather crafty
letter-writing, in which the new German
Chancellor had shown himself an adept of
sorts. The German wants a settlement on
the basis of the “14 points” outlined by the
President to Congress on January 8. But
it happens that, after laying down 14 points,
Wilson produced another of such a very
important nature that it governs all the
foregoing ones. This is a declaration (as
cabled) that there could be no peace with
the iIoHENZOLLERN pack or anything re-
sembling the same; that no armistice could
be granted while Germany continued her
illegal practices on land and sea ; that the
United Spates would continue to send to
Europe 250,000 men a month; and finally
that the process of evacuation and the con-
ditions of armistice must be left to the mili-
tary leaders. If that doesn’t daze the con-
spirators in Berlin, nothing will but the butt-
end of a rifle. That Germany wants peace of a
kind —her own kind—more than anything else
in the world is morally certain. But, this is
only another way of saying that the mur-
derous gang at Potsdam are desperately
anxious to save their bacon, not only in a
military sense, but politically. And, inci-
dental to this, it is certainly not one of
Wilson’s points that at the end of the war
the Kaiser and his push should be carrying
on their blasphemous partnership at the old
address. Meanwhile a bright light has been
thrown by the Hun on his own character.
At the moment he asks for peace he
blows up a big unarmed passenger
steamer under circumstances of the
grossest barbarity, sending hundreds of
passengers to death. A nation that dotes
this sort of thing would do anything. Stand-
ing alone, such a deed would be good reason
for turning down the alleged olive branch.
Taken in conjunction with the record of the
past, it adds another fo multitudinous
reasons for conversing with the Hun in the
only way he understands. On the battle
front lie has been getting well trimmed, but
he is not yet defeated to the extent of being
knocked off his feet. He will not admit
being walloped until he is down, for mili-
tary defeat would involve a political disaster
at home that would be overwhelming. It is
to dodge the knock in two places and preserve
his skin that the Flohenzollekns are talk-
ing peace through a factotum’s mouth to-day.
If the Allies are fighting for anything at all
it is that this family and its toughs shall
not preserve anything, and the Allies’ pro-
mise to blow Prussianism up in the air ought
to be honored without amendment.
Concerning’ a Lieutenant-Governor's
Hire.
Notice of motion by Gardiner, in N. S.
Wales Assembly:—
That the Government, in paying to Sir William
CVllex, while acting as Lieutenant-Governor, a
salary at the rate of £6OOO per annum, which is
£1750 per annum in excess of the salary provided for
the position, was guilty of unwarrantable extrava-
gance, and deserving of censure.
Well, to begin with, there is an official
precedent or rule or something attached
to the remuneration of a deputy Cocked
Ilat. The arrangement between 'the
British Government, which supplies the
Hat, after preliminary approval, and
Ma, who supplies the cash, is that when
the deputy takes on the job during an ex-
change of Hats he shall get half the regular
wages. The probabilities are that if he was
not paid in the usual way he could recover
by legal process and put the bailiffs into
Government House to satisfy judgment by
distraint. Obviously, the presence of frowsy
individuals with notebooks on the exalted
premises entering up particulars of the vice-
regal furniture and kitchen utensils would
be a very gross scandal, calculated to bring
the Empire into ridicule and cause the
Sovereign acute mental anguish. The arith-
metic is very simple. The salary of
the real Cocked Hat is £5000; of Cullen,
C.J., £3500. In the absence of the £5OOO-
- Cullen takes £2500 as deputy,
plus his own wage, or £6OOO in all. When
the individual entitled to the £5OOO is accept-
ing it, the expenditure is £B5OO, divided
among two persons instead of £6OOO going
to one. Obviously, if payment of the £6OOO
is “unwarrantable extravagance,” the hand-
ing out of £B5OO is an act of criminal pro-
fligacy. It would in this paper’s judgment
be a lot more sane for Gardiner to concen-
trate on the major amount and directly chal-
lenge the vote of £5OOO a year (plus allow-
ances) for a Governor. How many think-
ing citizens believe that payment of
this person’s salary is anything but
an exhibition of waste in its worst possible
form, or that his billet is other than a sham?
So far as the £6OOO a year paid to Cullen
goes, the best that can be said about it is
that he got every penny that was owing to
him; and the worst that there may possibly
be some men who, in the peculiar circum-
stances of the hour, would have been big-
hearted enough not to. But they are mighty
few in number. The only way to guard
against abuse and waste and scandalously
over-paid officialdom is to cut the evil tree
at the tap-root.
“H.” : Apropos of some remarks about
the harsh treatment of union secretar-
ies by their bosses, consider the following
list of some of the more prominent trade-
union officials in N. S. Wales who have
chucked their jobs or been chucked within
recent years: Sinclair (Boilermakers),
Dave Sullivan (Moulders), Teddy Cutler
(Furniture Trades), Sid Harrison (Wharf
Laborers), Durack (Tailors), Andy Spence
(Bread Carters). Mick Connington (Trolly
and Draymen), LI. A. Mitchell (Engine-
drivers and Firemen), Dan O’Sullivan
(Railway Workers), Roe and Adams
(Painters), H. Mercer (Clerks and others),
George Lewis (Millers), and George
Saunders -(Milk and Ice Carters). These
are only a few, and they were enthusiasts
who were responsible, in most cases, for the
organisation and strength of their associa-
tions, arid some of them were sacked, when
they liar, made the job good enough to be
worth while, in favor of some intriguing
new-comer. One man was jettisoned by his
union because a point w*As raised about his
being “unfinancial,” and, it being discovered
that, by an error, his payments were 2Jd.
or thereabouts in arrear on the night of
the meeting, he was ruled as ineli-
gible to stand for re-election. Some of the
men got out to other jobs before their mates
could fire them; but it must have, been the
result of a long process of disillusionment
that led such a man as H. A. Mitchell
to take a job as employer’s representative in
industrial matters.
William Noah Hedges, formerly M.H.R.
for Fremantle, is the Nationalist choice for
John Forrest’s old seat —the Swan. The by-
election takes place on the 26th inst. Nowa-
days, though his occupation is stated as
farmer and grazier, Hedges’ headquarters
are at Palace Court. St. George’s Terrace,
Perth, a neighborhood which admirably suits
the candidate’s high estimation of himself.
Hedges began his career as a carpenter, and
rose to affluence on the Westralian building
boom of the State’s gold-producing heyday.
When he reached the Reps, he established
himself in a luxurious mia-mia at Kew
(Melb.), and lived up to his position with
seme sumptuousness. As a Parliamentarian
Hedges showed himself very jealous’ of his
State’s interests and not greatly concerned
with the national aspect of politics.
Economy in small matters apparently
doesn’t appeal to Yic. Labor-leader Prender-
gast, M.L.A. In his opinion the proposal to cut
down the number of free Hansards from 20
to five per member in order to shepherd the
paper supply, would be “a mean and petty
economy, only representing SOO or 900 copies
a week.” The opinion of the free and enlight-
ened voter who is asked to pay 6d. per copy of
the printed drivel is shown by the fact that
the revenue from sales averages a whole and
entire shilling (12d.) a day. But Prendergast
doesn’t despair of saving the political
heathen in his blindness—so long as the
supply of free Hansard is maintained. Still,
he would have made a better showing had he
heartily endorsed the proposal at curtailment
and tacked on a few further economy sugges-
tions of his own. such as the abolition of
Parliamentary perks like free soap, writing-
paper, light reading matter, free railway
trips, commission picnics, and so on. Rut
that isn’t to be expected- from within the
club in the Exhibition Buildings.
The Society of Artists.
The Society of Artists’ show hangs out in
the big square Education Building, which
squats like a wealthy retired ironmonger in
Loftus-street, Sydney. It is a fairly big
affair numbering 318 pieces—about equal to
three centipedes or the army that held Ther-
mopylae. Part of it is very good ; part of it
is very bad ; part of it isn’t. The race lies
between Landscape and Girl, and Girl wins,
though not by much, with Sundries a poor
third.
Miss Cumbrae-Stewart (nothing could be
more Scottish -than that combination) is
well to the front in Girl. There are three
of them with one-tliird of clothes among
them, all good to look upon, all handsome
and shapely and correct as to backbone, and
all the exact color of Girl, as any observant
person who has inspected that domestic ani-
mal will testify. They have all been pur-
chased, either by people who had some
acquaintance with Girl and were struck by
the resemblance or by strangers who desired
to study the subject.
B. E. Minns is a more draped performer
on the same instrument. His ladies even run
to hats. They include a purple girl, a green-
ish girl, “Doreen” (who is rather a blue
girl), a white girl, a pensive girl, a sunlit
girl of mixed colors, and a radiant girl in a
big hat. They are excellent, but better still
is “King Billy,” the old picturesque vanish-
ing person who looks like Henry Parkes even
if he has no other uses.
As already mentioned, there are 318 ex-
hibits, and 11 artists are responsible for 173
of them. Lionel Lintjsay is very abundant,
and is probably better than he ever was
before. His Spanish pictures show the ad-
vantages of a country where the summer sun
falls on massive stone walls that make a
grateful shade, instead of on galvanised-iron
roofs that make an ungrateful glare and a
crackle and burn the birds’ feet; also where
the ladies of the Backbloeks wear bright
colors instead of faded hues; and the Back-
blocks themselves are mellowed by time rather
than blown about by the dust of circum-
stance. To be mellowed by time is about
the only use the world has for Backbloeks.
The ladies are casual and untidy, and the one
priest in the collection looks like an apostle
of the fleshpots. Therefore Lionel Lindsay’s
art fills a void which a picture of neat
blouse-and-skirt maidens talking to a blame-
less and bashful minister in front of Ebe-
nezer Chapel or Little Bethel would only
make more void than before.
Howard Ashton deals largely in misty
landscapes. Out of 22 exhibits three are
described as Clouds and two are Mists, and
most of the others are cloudy or misty or
both as a side-line. But “Evening Gold” and
“Morning Glory” and “Romance in Blue and
Gold” are refreshing patches of color in a
grey, cloudy, misty world. Greyness and
mistiness are prevailing features in Aus-
tralian art shows, which is strange,- seeing
that one-third of this country has less than
JOin. of rain per annum, and the heaven
above is blue and brass and the earth beneath
is brown and iron and mortgaged. Howard
Ashton’s big exhibit may be summed up as
looking worth a great deal more than the
prices set down.
“Portobello” is the highest-priced painting
in Norman Lindsay’s excellent collection,
though it is hard to say whether it is the
best. It is a striking piece of color, includ-
ing some Spanish architecture, two girls who
seem to. have seen better days and to be glad
to be rid of them, and some brilliant cava-
liers. who are taking another stride towards
a drinker’s grave. The percentage of alcoholic
cases among brilliant cavaliers must have been
very high. Norman Lindsay has evolved a
new girl more ethereal than the old one, and
as he has the two running at once, likewise
an intermediate girl, there is a wide selection.
A complaint may be made re the “Satyr’s
Story,” inasmuch as the author rather
shirks the question of the creature’s anatomv.
It is supposed to look like a sort of stage Jew
with hoofs, but there is still room for an
expression of expert opinion.
jl’here are recently-risen artists in the
show, and some that are rising, and some
that think of rising, and some that may rise
if they go down first and then return to' their
present sea-level. Of the first category is
Eliott Gruner, who exhibits a lot of fine old
work because he is too busy learning to smite
the Hun for much new work. And there are
; i lot of people in the other categories. Alfred
Clint, who is not among the early risers but
is an. old institution, has to his credit two
Mornings, two Afternoons, a Sunset, three
Evenings, two Bays, two Beaches and a Cot-
tage. all good enough and none of them vio-
lent. bigoted, bloodthirsty or over the speed-
limit. Of Hardy Wilson’s “Blue Door” it
can be stated firmly that it is blue, which is
more than can be said for some doors; and
it is a door, which many blue things are not.
‘ The Tunnel” is the picture on which .T.
•T. Hilder rests his claim (or his executor
rests it for him) to fame this year, and the
legs of the support don’t give way under
the executor and let him down in a sitting
posture on the hard floor of disillusionment.
The artist has depicted, in realistic fashion
and realistic tints, the entrance to one of
this country’s great natural resources. A
tunnel in the mining business is arrived at
by purchasing or leasing the distant hill
that looks green, and boring into it with the
money of people who afterwards look blue
and see red. Mr. liilder has added a rich
brown effect and struck success Any ruined
mining-speculator would appreciate his work.
Percy Leason attains a high pinnacle in
“The Old Whim,” though public appreciation
lias somehow centred on “The Patch Cow-
rug,” in which a humane ordinary person is
putting a garment of no account on a
shadowy domestic animal to protect it from
the inclemency of the weather. It is good
work, certainly, and teaches a lesson re kind-
ness to humble creatures. D. H. Souter,
J. R. Eldershaw, Norman Carter, Albert
Collins and Hans Heysen are among those
who also ran—ran fast enough to keep out
of the dust. Heysen in particular would pay
a respectable dividend on the totalisator if
there weren’t too many competitors.
Though it is war-time war pictures are
missing, which is a happy circumstance.
War used to be picturesque in theory—that
is to say, before people realised that the
soldier in action is a tatterdemalion rather
than the spick-and-span hero of the mid-
Victorian time, and befoive instantaneous
photography revealed that the horses’ legs
in the Charge of the Light Brigade were an
absurdity. Now that they know war to be, in a
great measure, a cloud of gas, crawling with-
out feet over a blistered waste of crater-holes,
the glamor has faded. Besides, the incredible
idiocy of picture-film war, and the scorn it
has aroused, make the artist who hasn’t seen
war shy of rushing into the business. As
for the one who has seen war he probably
has a low opinion of it. The prevailing note
in art, as it hangs out in the hulking struc-
ture in Loftus-street, is peace—agriculture,
calm waters, mists, sunrise, shadows, restful
animals, woodlands, repose and such like. If
there is one storm-laslied landscape or angry
sea or infuriated fellow-creature or despair-
ing female with disordered mane, or beast in
a hurry, the same escaped this writer’s
notice. As fast a thing as there is in the
collection is the blotter in Olive Pink’s case
of leatherware, and it isn’t a heated or head-
long blotter either.
* Bildad” writes :
“The East-AVest Trouble,” as the newspaper heading
goes, was inevitable from the beginning. There is
only one transcontinental line, and the scarcity of
shipping has made it an essential link of communi-
cation. To the sort of person who assaults the foot-
ball umpire simply because he is an umpire, the
temptation to break the link was irresistible.
Considering how the present-day spokesmen of
Labor have identified themselves with Hun inter-
ests it was natural that the excuse for the strike
was the refusal to pay an indemnity or contribution
in the shape of a free pass for a lengthy period to
Carl Hermann AVittorf. The fact of Carl Hermann
AVittorf not being deadheaded at the expense of a
community which doesn't generally wear a name
like that has been advertised as one of the signs that
the Australian worker is trodden flat.
After the trouble had lasted some time it was
explained that there was really an accumulation of
grievances, not specified, at the time of the strike,
and that though the refusal of the management to be
held up or blackmailed for the free transportation of
Carl Hermann AA ittorf was the only reason assigned
it was merely the last straw that broke the union
camel’s back. If so it is a pity that the union
didn’t remember the other grievances first, and that
it didn’t select another straw as an excuse. Carl
Hermann was really the last straw that the camel
laid on the back of the management. The truculent
demand that Carl Hermann AVittorf should be a free
passenger was the matter on which the workers
joined battle, and it is a sneaking business to allege
afterwards that he was only a side issue or a pre-
tence or a straw or a hollow mockery. The big
idea at the bottom of all labor annoyances is that
the workers don’t get the full value of the product
of their labor. As regards the railways as a udiole
and the Transcontinental railway in particular, they
get the full value and something over—everything
that is left After paying interest on loans and a sub-
sidy thrown in by the general taxpayer. If the
interest on loans is objected to the Labor party
shouldn’t have piled up debts in the amazing fashion
it did every time it w’as in office, and it shouldn’t
be the advocate of frenzied borrowing that it is
to-day. Of course it may be said that with better
management there would be more to divide, despite
the loan interest. If so the Labor men sliould have
expounded that better management during their long
terms of Federal and State office, and they should
expound it now. Instead of doing this they almost
invariably made the results worse. On the
iHCc of things it looks as if there was a
resolve to block the Transcontinental railway
because it was the most sensational way of
being coarsely disagreeable towards the community.
Also that the trouble was based on the refusal of the
management to submit to petty blackmail rather
than on a plausible grievance to show that the
authority behind the strike was so powerful that it
didn’t need to be plausible. Also that Carl Her-
mann AA ittorf w T as regarded as a better name than
John Smith. For my part I don’t believe the man is
( arl Hermann AVittorf. I think he assumed the
name in order to be nasty.

The play, now at the Palace (Sydney),
naturally can’t move as fast as the photo-
drama it might have been ; but a smart stage
staff sees to it that waits are cut to the. last

a poor set of friends and relations and little

It makes a quick and effective curtain.
No leading lady could ask for a better
chance than this ingenious American play
gives. She has the centre of the stage all
the time, and, besides appearing intermit-
tently as the desirable young singing girl
with all her life before her, she lias “visions”
of herself as (1) a faded and disappointed
schoolmarm; (2) a loud and drinky prnna
donna; (3) a broken-hearted divorcee, and
(4) the divorcee down and out street-singing
for a crust and the morphine of forgetful-
ness. The quick movement of the play makes
it interesting, and the sure artistry of the
Tait star never flags. The part of Gina
Ashling is as big a test for Miss Polim as
the Chilcote-Loder role in “The Masquer-
ader” was for Guy Bates Post. The sup-
port varies greatly. Alfred Bristowe is im-
pressive all the time as the turbaned Indian
yogi, who totters in fainting from the street
and supplies crystal, mysticism, philosophy
and friendly advice free to the ‘ beau-ti-tul
lad-ee” who befriends him. Cyril Mackay,
as Paolo Salvo, the exuberant Italian adven-
turer who babbles about musical careers,
acts like an animated poster-figure in the
quiet suburban parlor scenes; yet in the
high-pitched dressing-room scene everyone
yells and knocks things over so that he is
almost quiet by comparison. Eileen Sparks,
as younger sister Rita, gets a hand in the
visionary school-room when she flies into a
temper and sneers triumphantly at her elder
sister whose hymn-singing beau she has
stolen. John Fernside is equally in place as a
clean lad determined to save his sister and
as a lazy young waster gone to seed. Eardley
Turner dodders up to specifications as Gina’s
selfish and dunderheaded old father, and
Gerald Kay Souper, Arthur Greenaway and
Harmon Lee are up to their usual as Gina’s
three assorted suitors. Cecil Brooking splut-
ters shrilly as Piequard, a French opera
manager; ‘and John de Lacey doubles the
parts of a second-rate Russian singer in a
grand operatic temper and a noble plain-clothes
cop. Gregan McMahon makes a trim divorce
attorney of the kind that doesn’t bite, while
George Bryant growls like a large dog as his
villainous legal opponent. Maurice Dudley, as
the divorce judge, suggests a dormouse that
has been kept up too late ; and Georgia Har-
vey endures the coffee make-up of a colored
girl dresser. Little Kathleen Lindgren
leads the children in the bright schoolroom
scene. Taking a well-earned call at the end
of the first performance, producer A. L.
Pearce paid a compliment to head mechan-
ist Bridger and his team for over-
coming difficulties and knocking seconds off
the stage clock.

Exactly what it is
makes this play
draw so strongly is
not a very easy
conundrum. To be-
gin with, it isn’t a
play in the ordi-
nary sense, being
more accurately described as several inci-
dental helpings. The weak links in it are
numerous and varied. On the other hand,
it goes with a snap and has at least approxi-
mate relationship to life —of a sort. Even
the opium-joint scene seems to fit into
place. The long popularity in Sydney
of the Man, etc., is, in all probability,
because he is twin brother to the goat a lot
of other men were in the long ago, and to the
donkey another lot wish they were, and
above all other things, because he gets back
from the gutter without ranting about re-
pentance. He doesn’t repent anything -
and, having acquired Marcel, the cabaret
singer, he would be something less than
human if he did. After next week, The

“Katinka” is going along nicely at Her
Majesty’s (Sydney) with Florence Young in
the lead and 'the reliable Royal Comics thun-

sweet, plaintive strain.

is to be served up on Friday. The new show
will include a military sketch and two new
artists —J. T. Halley, baritone; and J. H.
Dunne, comedian. The Playhouse funmakers
give only one matinde a week —on Saturdays.

The Repertory Theatre (Adelaide) gave
three short plays one evening during the
week in the presence of the Governors of
Victoria and S.A. The best of the pieces
was Olipliant Down’s “Maker of Dreams,” in
which Zoe Reid and Wilfrid Neill repeated
a former success, as Pierrette and a kindly
mender of fractured hearts. Both were capi-
tal. Ronald Simpson recalled memories of a
better Pierrot, the dashing Douglas Walsh,
lately a victim of war. All the Rep. Theatre
best' stage love-makers have been called to
other arms. In “Loving as We Do” (by
Gertrude Robins) the same weakness was
noticed again. Wadmore was amateurish,
while Beryl Kook made love artistically. The
plot of the piece is quaint: Eve comes to
Peter’s flat, and is welcomed till she
announces that this time she has come for
ever. This staggers Peter. He is not pre-
pared for such a practical proof of affection,
and in 10 minutes the lady is on her way
back to her husband^—first finding out per
telephone that she has not yet been missed.
Louis Parker’s “Man in the Street” com-
pleted the bill. James Anderson and Miss
Kook had merely to play up to the down-and-
out figure brilliantly presented by Ray
Walsh, a party willing to sponge on his
daughter till he finds her a “real lidy” (by
marriage), and then being obliging enough to
fade out of her life.
Victor Fitzherbert should have touched the
height of his ambition at the Tivoli (Adel-
aide). He has been playing all sorts of
villains there for several years. Now the
Tivoli presents “The Greatest Scoundrel Liv-
ing” ; and Fitzherbert is It. The Majestic
gives what it calls “two great shows in one.”
Fuller’s Minstrel Show takes half the pro-
gramme, iand Paul Stanhope’s American Revue
Co. fills in the other part, particularly with
the Grafters Quartet and the Ginger Girls.
Pictures are on the intense side. The Royal
has been showing Mrs. Tanqueray (with the
late George Alexander as the husband),
West’s presents Clara Kimball Young in her
“House of Glass” (which an unpleasant out-
sider threw stones at and brought .about her
ears), the Pav. has a detective busy trying to
find out “Who Killed Walton ?” and Charles
Ray and Marguerite Clark are at Wonder-
graph—less strenuous but quite as interest-
ing.

overjoyed at the

ordinary citizen the
joy of the play is
the discovery of a
fairy godmother in
the startling cam-
ouflage of a movie
vampire. She is
hardly the sort who
produces all good
things with a
wand, but at the
right moment, when
Potash and Perl-
mutter are faced
with disaster, she
props up the tot-
tering business
with her own un-
suspected money
and sets the glum
partners smiling
again. In fact, it is understood that she gives
them a chance to remake their fortunes, so
probably yet another sequel will show them
multi-millionaires with, perhaps, a pawnshop
on the lawn of their home instead ot a
summer-house or a fountain.

From an Adelaide critic: —
The Art Club haa an unpretending show in the
gallery of the Society of Arts, lent for the occa-
sion. The display of leatherwork, woodwork, enamels
and (especially) painting on china, is good, and has
attracted much attention and some buyers. But the
pictures are a poor lot. Even Will Ashton, Giles and
Ethel Barringer have not given of their best. There
are some good flowers, and Sydney Harbor has come
in for unusual attention. The studies of heads show
the usual harsh and forbiddirfg faces that seem to
haunt the local artist’s studio. An exception is lan
Mackinnon, who has two really good heads. And
Mabel Dawkins has a promising black-and-white.
But it is a relief to turn back to the leatherwork
and china.
The troubles of “Oh, Boy,” will be over at
Her Majesty’s (Melb.) on Saturday, when
“High Jinks” reappears for a four-nights
revival. For the following Saturday (26tli)
“Hullo, Everybody,” is announced, and pre-
liminary puffs are leading the sanguine to
expect what the advt. describes as “a revela-
tion in revues.”
The elephants have hauled Wirths’ New
Circus to Melbourne, and the big show will
open in the Hippodroqie on Saturday (Caul-
field Cup night). Besides the usual extensive
menagerie the Wirths have the new artists
they brought out from America in March.
(The circus brothers consider that it was a
star act of their own getting the chosen per-
formers out of embattled U.S.A.) One of
the nerve-tickling turns will be provided by
Leo Montfort w’hen he does the Loop of
Death on the trapeze. Several Montfort
imitators are stated to have been killed while
trying to do it, and some of the fools pro-
bably deserved to be.
The Majestic (Melb.) is again exploiting
Norma Talmadge in “The Secret of the Storm
Country,” a sequel to “Tess of the Storm
Country,” which is guaranteed to make the
tearful person look like a street hose. In
addition, there is at this theatre an adapta-
tion of an O. Henry story, “Schools and
Schools,” and a delightful comedy, “The
Agonies of Agnes,” Marie Dressier being
responsible for the gladness thereof.
Hoyt’s main suit in Melbourne is “Cleo-
patra,” wherein Theda Bara is at her old
habits in a number of gorgeous scenes. She
has somewhat suppressed her ordinary vam-
pire exuberance for this production, and
almost realises the enchantress of popular
imagination. Miss Bara is giving the blithe-
some eye to Antony and other ex-celebrities
at the Lyceum, whilst the star at De Luxe
is Dorothy Dalton in an invitation entitled
“Love Me.” The Bueeetin was eager to take
her at her word, but on application it was in-
formed that her address is U.S., and that
no passports were available. A nice new
young movie actress, Clifford Bruce, appears
iu “The Fourth Estate,” and Jack Pickford
has the lead in a fresh juvenile piece, en-
titled “His Majesty, Bunker Bean.”
“THE EYES OF YOUTH.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now, young Gina was a beauty somewhere off the
New York track,
But the people she had round her made her social
outlook black;
Still she didn’t know how wicked was
little game
Till the noble Indian yogi with the ball of crystal
came.
She’d a sanctimonious suitor waiting humbling on
the mat;
She’d a darling kitten sister who was going to be a
cat;
And the suitor and the sister would despise her later
on—
Or at least the crystal said so when its light she
gazed upon.
She’d a musical Italian simply mad about her voice,
And she’d golden dreams of Paris, but she never
made that choice,
Fo' - she saw herself a boozy prima donna gone to pot,
And the crystal vision faded with an angry brother’s
shot.
She'd a ruined, selfish father, who was keen to see her
tved
With a sleek and slimy villain. But the life she
would have led
With the villain sleek and slimy wasn’t plain to
mortal eye.
’Twas the yogi’s crystal showed her the divorce court
by-and-bye.
In between her crystal gazings she had lucid spells
(Lights up !)
When the characters paraded like the horses in the
Cup.
But when all the nightmares ended she had Mr. Right
in view
And both heroine and hero were still there as good
as new!
Then the yogi left the crystal, scorning, like a gent,
his pay,
And no one threw it at him as he passed upon his
way;
But if Gina’s future husband was a careful sort of
card
He took hammers to that crystal in his newly-wed
back yard.

Twelve months ago the directors announced
that paid capital was to be increased to halt
a million by the transfer of £200,000 of re-
serves to capital, making the £5 shares paid
up to £2 10s. The formal reserve fund then
amounted to £870,000, and £50,000 has been
tacked on from the current year’s profits;
total, £420.000. This reserve fund now stands
at £300,000; so £120,000 of it has gone into
capital, leaving £BO,OOO which has apparently
been drawn from other funds which The
Bulletin had not included among reserves
for purposes of the table. The South British
is now in its 47th year, and has been one of
the big successes among Australasian cos.
(its head office is in Auckland, and besides
having branches throughout the Common-
wealth and Maoriland it is represented in
Britain, North and South Africa, India,
China and Japan). The four war years have
shown a big growth of business which has.
proved highly profitable: profits for the four
years to 1914 totalled £840,960; for the past
four years they have amounted to £558,870.
A lot of the increase in premiums, of course,
is due to war risks which the co. has handled,,
but since the loss rate has actually been
below normal this war business has been very
sweet. This comparison shows how the vari-
ous figures have moved :

The underwriting surplus last year was
£82,346 (compared with £604)61 for the year
prior to Wilhelm’s adventure), and the profit
shown in the table for the 12 months was
made up of this surplus together with in-
terests and rents, £51,929, an addition of
£30,000 to the reserve for nnexpired risks,
and £3740 added to the investment fluctua-
tion reserve, less £5581, representing £42.)
added to a leasehold sinking fund and £5156
voted to the staff’s provident fund. The
striking feature of the co.’s accounts is that
the amount earned in interest and rents
(less income tax) more than suffices to pay
the shareholders’ dividend; which means that
every penny of the underwriting profit and
something more besides goes to strengthen the
co.’s position.
From the policy-holders’ point of view the
South British is exceptionally strong. Capi-
tal is now £500,000, and reserves £703,342;
total, £l,2o3,342—equivalent to 183 p.c. of
the year’s premiums. Put another way, there
are funds sufficient to more than cover the
aggregate losses of the past four war years.
There have been some big alterations in the
disposition of these funds during the past
10 years:—

ties ..£103,422 16.1 p.c. £698,488 47.5 p.c.

Stock and
Debentures 22,599 3.5 ~ 69,399 4.7 „
Sundries . . 17,521 2.8 „ 28,007 1.8 ~
The reduction of the proportion in mortgages
and in premises are the two features of that
comparison. No less than £53(5,528 is how in
War Loan. To meet any shrinkage in its
investments the co. has a reserve fund
amounting to £25,740, and, in addition, there
is a contingency fund of £20.000. Out of
last year’s profits, as shown in the first table,
premises have been written down by £25,000.
As for the shareholders, they have done very
well. No less than £400.000 of the £500,000
paid capital represents profits capitalised dur-
ing the past six years. Profits are not likely
to be so handsome after the war as they have
been lately, but apart from war risks this
Australasian office’s business is growing
steadily, and, as before mentioned, the in-
terest earnings alone pay the present divi-
dend.

Bananaland breweries have been on a good
wicket during the war years, because the
Ryan Ministry refused to introduce six-
o’clock closing legislation. The reason pro-
fits are not quite so good as they were four
years ago has been due, no doubt, to in-
creased cost of production and added tax-
ation. The co.’s Profit and Loss account is
now made less informative, and instead of
revenue and expenses being stated separately
all that is now given is a mere entry of the
profits. So how the additional £3OOO of
profit for the year was made is not shown,
but, probably, as in the other States prices
have been lifted.
When the Bananaland boom collapsed this
co. was badly hit. and in 1002 12s. Od. was
written oii the 255. shares. That was not
enough, apparently, and for another 10
years profits suffered while old holes were
being filled in. This shows how the bal-
ance-sheet figures have moved in 10 years:—
1908. 1917. 1918.

Sundry debtors . . 25,829 45,961 35,026
Cash and public securities 1,330 7,397 25,9< i
During the year the co.’s Queen-street pro-
perty, which 12 months ago stood in the
books at £30,224, and on which it had
raised a loan of £18,300, was sold to the
Municipal Council for £30,250. The loan
has been extinguished, and the co. now holds
£15,250 of municipal debentures. This
explains the considerable changes in the
balance-sheet figures in the year. A new
warehouse and stores are being erected on a
propertv acquired a few years ago, but there
is no hint of what the new premises will
cost. Under the circumstances any further
comparison with the figures of 10 years ago
is not of any great value. Anyhow, they
show that, provided ample allowance has
been made for depreciation and for contin-
gencies, the co. is about £57,000 better off
than it was in 1908. Reserves accumulated
are only £5500 short of the paid capital; so
the 10 p.c. div., reckoned on shareholders
funds, is not all it looks. * #

This co. deals chiefly in insurance side-lines,
such as are undertaken by friendly societies
and lodges. The class of business is shown
by last year’s claims: —

Death claims .. . . • • ■ • 3 fj34
Maturities .. ■ • • • ■ •
Surrenders . . • • ■ • . • •

In its 22 years the co. has paid out £153,283
in this way. Premiums are mostly payable
weekly or fortnightly, and have generally to
be collected by the co. Besides, it has to
canvass for business. So expenses are heavy
—and no less than £6BBO of last year s
expenses of £11,511 went in “commission and
superintendents’ salaries.” Including the
£650 paid in dividends to shareholders exes,
have absorbed the following proportions of
total income:—
1909.. £44 18 4 p.c. | 1914*.. £45 14 4 p.c.

1913.. 42 7 8 „ | 1918*.. .39 1 3 ,
♦Expenses include £lOOO bonus paid to shareholders.
The co. had a good time last year : income
increased by £1845, and both claims and
exes, were less than for the previous year.
So the record amount of £10,831 has been
added to the assurance fund. However, the
expense rate is very solid ; it could not be
otherwise in this class of business. In many
cases, perhaps, the insurer could do better
in a lodge; but no lodge has developed the
habit of calling regularly at the front door
to collect subscriptions. Besides there are
many people who don’t like the lodge idea,
and this co. fulfils all their requirements and
its methods are convenient. On the other
hand, there are people who need to be chased
and argued with before they will consider
providing against sickness and other troubles.
In that way the co. is doing really good work.
Capital is £lO,OOO. and the assurance fund
now amounts to £68,425. The funds are
invested in mortgages, £53,840; Government
securities, £12,654; loans on policies, £4685;
£6211 is in cash; and £1254 in odds and
ends. As to the mortgages the directors state
that “no single item of interest remained
unpaid” at the date of making up the
accounts. Shareholders have been doing very
well. Their regular dividend is at the rate
of 6$ p.c. p.a., but after the actuarial investi-
gations in 1914 and 1917 they were handed
a 10 p.c. bonus on each occasion.

Looking back over that table shows what dif-
ference the war has made to this co. Mili-
tary contracts have, of course, kept it busy ;
but apart from that the Protection given the
industry by reduced importations due to
shipping difficulties has created a demand
for the locally-manufactured article. The
co. had been at work 31 years when the war
started, and its reserves totalled only £31,57.)
after paying dividends the importer would
have scorned. For the past four years a
13 p.c. dividend lias been paid, while enough
profit has been left in the business to more
than double the reserves. Disregarding the
fixed assets, this shows what has happened
since 1914: —
1914. 1918.
Stock (including raw material).. £107,784 £115,221
Book debts. . . . . . . . 36,185 42,284

Less liabilities . . . . . . 72,166 91,074
Surplus assets . . . . £71,803 £101,431
Thus the surplus of more or less liquid assets
over liabilities has been increased by £29,528
in the four years. In addition, a freehold
property has been acquired at Christchurch
having a book value of £8334; while £19,665
has been added to buildings and plant. This
latter item now stands in the books at
£78,769, £20,000 having been written off for
depreciation since 1914. What will happen
when normal conditions return it is difficult
to forecast. In the meantime this co. is
building up a reputation for its goods and
getting itself into a stronger position to com-
bat the competition of the importer when
shipping is available to carry the foreign-
made article.

The profits for the past year have been bet-
tered in only one other term since the present
co. took over an old business in 1907. And
besides the figures shown in the table £1099
has been set aside out of the year’s profits
to provide for contingencies. The war has
helped the industry considerably by restrict-
ing imports, though it has been in a more
comfortable position as regards tariff protec-
tion than most other Australian industries,
possibly because Labor-leader Tudor, who
was several times Trade and Customs Minis-
ter in Labor Cabinets, had been in the business
himself. Still, there is no reason at all why
every covering required for Australian heads
should not be made locally. Almost every-
thing in the way of raw material is avail-
able. A feature of the industry is that ex-
tensive plant is not required: of this eo. s
capital of £30,000, plant represents only
£5456, and consequently the cut into profits
to meet depreciation, etc., is not big. The
co. has been piling up cash assets, as this
table shows: —

“In view of the war conditions,” say the
directors, “special care has been given to
valuations and lending, and business contin-
ues to be satisfactory.” New advances made
during the past five years have been as fol-
lows- 1914, £38,478; 1915, £19,700; 1916,
£20,453; 1917, 17,415; 1918, £30,554. Loans
on mortgage now total £124,221 (“all live
loans,” the directors report), compared with
£120,717 last year and £126.543 in 1914.
Other figures are given in this comparison:

1917 .. 50,654 120,816 920
1918 . . 52,113 124,324 1610
Creditors are thus very well protected; for
every £1 due to depositors, etc., there are
advances worth £2 7s. Bd.; so even if the worst
happened and the value of the securities
slumped to less than half their present value
the whole of the outside money in the busi-
ness would be fully covered. During recent
years, as far as this paper knows, only one
property has been thrown on the manage-
ment’s hands, and the security for that was
amply covered. The co. is in a strong posi-
tion,'and it should be able to weather almost
any troubles that may lie ahead. Besides,
the management is now proceeding very cau-
tiously, and making doubly certain of its
securities. Though advances are less than
they were four years ago, owing to abnormal
conditions the co. is earning more than it used
to. Interest on the average of the 1913-14
loans worked out at 7.6 p.c.; on the average
of the past 12 months’ figures interest has
returned 8.3 p.c. Whether it will do as
well in future it is hard to forecast, as every-
thing depends on the extent of the depres-
sion which it is almost certain will follow the
present loan boom. However, the management
has been putting some very profitable busi-
ness on its books during the past couple of
years.

The record profit for the past half-year is
due to increased prices charged and also to a
slight growth of business. But there’s
nothing exciting about it: this Launceston
co. is still a poor relation among Australian
gas cos., and the string of 4 p.c. dividends
goes back many years beyond the period cov-
ered by the table. The co. has as a competi-
tor a municipal enterprise well situated to
supply cheaply-generated electricity, and
which is not out to make fat profits. Capital
is £50.000, and there is a debenture load of
£29,539, besides an overdraft amounting to
£2596. There has been very little alteration
in the balance-sheet figures in 10 years:—
June,’oB. Dec.,’l7. June,’lB.

Assets other than fixed assets 16,316 12,450 12,420
Excess liabilities .. £23,115 £21,020 £20,610
So after distributing a poor 4 p.c. div. and
paying for repairs, renewals and extensions,
the balance-sheet shows an improvement of
only £2505 since 190 S.

The approach of summer makes it imperative for
every stock-owner to give a thought to the purifica-
tion of drinking water for his stock. If he is content
to let them drink muddy, slimy water he cannot
expect them to keep in good condition. All over the
State careful stock-owners are using Aluminoferrie in
the proportion of one pound to every 2000 gallons of
water. It ensures pure liquid water in dams, wells,
tanks, etc., at very low cost, by precipitating all
impurities and leaving the water clear and pure,
free from any ingredient injurious to man or beast.
Let us go into details telling you how it will be to
your advantage to use Aluminoferrie. William

The scarcity of shipping, which has consider-
ably curtailed the importation of foreign tim-
bers, has helped this co. And though the
State construction boom has practically come
to an end, there is a big demand for local
hardwoods. So the profits for the past
half-year are better than for any other term
since the war began. The directors have
wisely kept the dividend down, permitting
a substantial surplus to be added to reserves.
The co.’s interests are chiefly on the N. S.
Wales North Coast rivers—the Bellingen and
Nambucca. Capital is £75,000. The balance-
sheet figures have moved this way since 1914:

Investments, cash, etc. 4,939 7,695
The investments consist of small holdings in
lighterage and carting cos. and in other saw-
mills. While there is now a good market for
hardwoods it is difficult to forecast the imme-
diate prospects. It is not unlikely that a
dull period lies ahead. But with luck —good
seasons and good markets and sound political
management—there should be good times
after the war wounds have healed. This co.
is now in a much better position to meet the
future. No indication is given of the allow-
ance made for depreciation, but the manage-
ment appears to have made ample provision,
while the stocks have been “properly checked
and carefully valued.”
The .various copper-producing cos. are
again in the doldrums. The copper con-
tents of ore raised since the end of last
month cannot be got into the refined state
before the end of this year, and as the Brit-
ish Munitions Committee, at the last asking,
would not commit itself beyond the end of
the year for refined copper, local producers
are wondering who is going to buy their
pink metal that is being raised now from
day to day in the form of ore. W. M.
Hughes will have to get busy, and find some-
one to put up some cash against the produc-
tion. The banks in Australia cannot be ex-
pected to carry the copper cos., the War
Loan, the wheat and all the rest. Somebody
will have to buy from us, or our name is
just plain Mud.

The spur railway at Mount Hope
(N.S.W.) is nearing completion, and by the
beginning of November will be ready for
traffic. Unless rain falls during the next
few days it may be expected that the mine
will have to close down for a time. Although
the show has now practically got its rail-
way, water troubles will have to be faced
from time to time. The railway can cart
water, as is done for C.S.A. at times, but it
is a costly business. Although present price
of copper perm'ts of water carting, under
normal conditions a permanent water supply
will have to be provided. The mine con-
tinues to open up -veil, but the old mill is
not making a name for itself. The co.,
however, is piling up a valuable asset in its
slimes dump, which will presently all go
through the leaching plant. The experi-
mental work on the slimes has been done. ■
and the sooner the slimes plant goes up the
sooner the co. will have a revenue account
that is worth while.

The platinum getters of Fifield (N.S.W.)
art- up against three troubles at present. The
first is want of water—it has been a very dry
season for the western miners; the second is
that, although refined platinum is selling in
London at £2O per ounce, the miners have
to accept payment on a basis of £lB per
ounce. The British Government appears to
have placed itself in the hands of one Eng-
lish firm, and that firm has never been inter-
ested in giving the miner a fair price. Fur-
ther, that same firm at this moment sees
that the miner gets no payment for the
osmiridium contained in the platinum pro-
duced at Fifield. The miner, drought
stricken, with many tons of stuff waiting to
be puddled, is getting a kick ready.
All the molybdenite cos. on the Yetholme
field (N.S.W.) are very active just now.
The Mammoth is proceeding with the
erection of its second set of 10-head
stamps and treatment plant, with an
eye to a third set in the near future.
Mt. Tennyson is completing the installation
of its first 10-liead, is preparing to put in a
tube-mill equivalent to another 14-head, and
hopes to start crushing - in January. The
2500 ft. aerial rope-way that is to carry the
ore from the side of the hill to the plant on
the flat is also under way. On the eastern
side of the field the B. H. Prop, is making
complete preparations for a thorough pros-
pecting of the 127 acres held under option
from the Mammoth.
* * * *
The latest crushing from the Central
mine, on the old Hill End (N.S.W.) field,
resulted in 420 z. of retorted gold. The stone
raised from the winze on the mica vein in the
Amalgamated mine shows improvement. The
Deep Levels Hawkins Hill mine is just now
centring attention on a rise from the 320 ft.
level to the 220 ft., meeting en route a winze
that is being sunk from the higher level.
The next fortnight should see the work com-
pleted. The immediate result will be the
facilitating of the handling of stone for the
mill, which will be able to treat bigger par-
cels when the large boiler now on the way
is put in position.

The gold-reef four miles from the Mount
Dudley mine, near Trunkie (N.S.W.), dis-
covered by Archie McKellar, who also dis-
covered the Mount Dudley make, has been
inspected by Warden Burke, who witnessed
the washing prospects from both the reef
and surrounding loom. In each case good
colors showed up. To date 50 acres of the
hill have been taken up, and there is any
amount of stone, as the main reef shows a
width of 20ft. with an outcrop up to four
feet. Copper colorings seem to be on the
quartz. Just what the show is likeljt to
be worth won’t be known until someone
starts to go down. So far only the surface
has been scratched.
During (lie half-year ended July 31 Y-
Water (N.S.W.) sluiced 296,300 cub. yds.
of wash-dirt for 87 tons 14cwt. tin oxide.
The average recovery was 0.66301 b. of oxide !
per cub. yard, so although Y-Water is the
second-largest tin producer in New England,
it must be considered low-grade. The net
profit for the term was £4089. or less than
4d. per cub. yard. The directors have
strengthened the reserve for depreciation by
£lOO3 out of the term’s nrofits. With the
balance brought in the total amount carried
forward on July 31 was £3609. Surplus
liquid assets on July 31 amounted to £4447.

Carpathia, Ardlothan (N.S.W.), met with
a make of brown ore 3ft. wide and assaying
05 p.c. tin in winzing from the 123 ft. level.
The winze is down 18ft., and the new make
is directly under the No. 3 ore body from
No. 1 shaft. It is as yet limited in extent.
Similar discoveries have been fairly fre-
quent, for the Carpathia is a series of pipe
deposits at the contact of schist and granite.
The co. has done much better during the
past half-year than it did in the previous
term, the ore in No. 4 shaft turning out
exceptionally well. This portion of the mine
is down 265 ft.

Castles of air are being built because Edna
Central on July 31 had plant and buildings
valued at £25,230, stocks £4416 and cash and
gold £5365 to set against debts of £1675.
Really, there is nothing to chortle over in
that, considering the mine has yielded
£150.000 of gold, paid £9OOO in divs., and
swallowed a lot of shareholders’ capital.
The half-year’s work wouldn’t have given a
working profit if the co. had not drawn on
accumulated sands. What spoilt profits was
the usual water trouble, and it isn’t a
pleasant prospect to consider that once Edna
May eases up, pumping costs of Central and
the Deep are more likely to jump than fall.
Manager Giblin won’t estimate ore reserves
at the Central' because, with the mine nearly
gutted above 221 ft., and with the interme-
diate at 296 ft. only partially developed, he
declined to tackle the job of settling the
value of the ore. However, Giblin’s report
was issued early in August, and since then
he has got to the end of the shoot both south
and east, so something definite ought now to
be forthcoming. What with the shortening
of the shoot of the New reef and its smaller
width, Edna Central would be a sick show if
it didn’t expect to get some stone rolling in at
about 300 ft. from Edna Consolidated. Gib-
lin’s job now is to build up fresh reserves.
With the east drive at No. 4 close to the
spot where the shoots should make he has
plenty of material for a Cup gamble over
hitting the Middle reef at the boundary
fence.

“Bungawalbyn”; McDermott, manager of
the Ivanhoe (W.A.). made his impression
on Govett when the latter visited the mine
in 1903, and that impression has never faded.
Without detracting in any way from the late
Bob Nieolson’s organising ability and his
capacity for getting the best out of his men
(B. 19/9/T8). McDermott was “the man
behind the gun” when the matter of reduc-
tion of costs had to be boldly faced, and it
was in his department and on his initiative
that the saving was effected which prevented
the mine from passing to other management.
Govett would sooner McDermott had re-
mained at the Ivanhoe than have gone to the
Gwalia. But the latter show did not make
McDermott’s reputation; it only enhanced
what had already been won by the work done
by him on the Associated Northern (Iron
Duke), when, under the late Captain Rodda,
he unearthed the rich chute there, and, later,
his work tin the Ivanhoe.
More dirt was shifted by the Duke and
Main Leads Consols, Maryborough (Vic.),
last half-year than in the previous term, but
the grade dropped* from £3 10s. lOd. to
£2 6s. Sd. per fathom. This result brings
forth plain talk from the Board. Costs are
about £3 155., so that a dead loss resulted.
This is due partly to wash having to be
trucked two miles to the shaft, and also to
the increase in wages. To put down a new
shaft to work the rest of the lead in the mine
and equip it would take £6OOO. If the
quality of the wash in the leading drives
assured good results the job would be done ;
but the fact is that not only are prospects
poor but any mining carried out lower down
the gutter has been in low-grade dirt. So
the investor has the cold comfort of knowing
that those best able to advise don’t see pro-
fitable work ahead, and so think shaft-sinking
unnecessary. The next move therefore will
probably be to hold a liquidator’s sale.

The high price of tin has led to an over-
hauling of some of the islands in Bass
Straits, on the biggest of which. Flinders
Island, Australia’s first tin was discovered.
When Flinders and Bas s put in there in
1798, on their way to circumnavigate Tas-
mania, they found some grains of black tin
near the beach. There is now talk of an
expedition to the almost unknown Hogan’s
Group, between Wilson’s Promontory and
Kent’s Group.
The Australian or Maoriland farmer who
has any doubt as to the advantages to be
gained by co-operation requires no further
evidence than that provided by the splendid
results shown by the N.Z. Farmers’ Co-
operative Association of Canterbury, Ltd.
The chief object of co-operation in any
business is to provide cost-price service for
the co-operator—that is, saving for him the
profits which the middleman would, under
the old system, make out of handling his
products, etc. The past four war years
have been crowded with difficulties for the
primary producer, but the figures which the
Canterbury Co-op. Association shows are a
striking illustration of exactly what co-
operation and good management can do. In
the four years to July 31 this farmers’ co.
has shown a total turnover worth nearly
fifteen million pounds ; its commission earn-
ings have amounted to £156,772, and, includ-
ing interest and the profits on handling mer-
chandise, the total earnings have been
£652,850. After paying all expenses, includ-
ing liberal allowance to the staff, etc., there
have been profits totalling £274.647. In the
four years co-operators have received divi-
dends representing 32 p.c. of their capital,
after having had returned to them rebates
representing up to 30 p.c. of the amount of
commission they had been charged, and re-
ceiving bonuses up to 5 p.c. on other goods
handled for them. These rebates and
bonuses are the big feature of a co-operative
concern, for they represent the major portion
of the money saved for the farmer which
would otherwise go to other people. But, of
course, all the profits made by a co-operative
concern are not distributed among co-opera-
tors, for the financial strength of the co.
has also to be built up. Thus the Associa-
tion now has reserves—mostly representing
undivided profit—totalling £I72,SSL
The N.Z. Farmers’ Co-op. Association of
Canterbury has grown into a very big con-
cern. It started in a small way in 1881,
and at the end of its first year had 800 share-
holders, with a paid-up capital of only
£3511; now there are 8416 co-operators, with
£536,910 capital paid-up. A glance at the
latest balance-sheet illustrates the magni-
tude of the Association’s operations, for in
addition to handling the farmers’ pro-
duce (turnover exceeded four millions
last year), it does a considerable
amount of financing. At July 31 its
advances to customers against stock, grain,
etc., amounted to £669.847. Property and
premises had a book value of £200,824, and
though some of these properties have appreci-
ated in value since the co. purchased them,
there, has been no writing-up. Plant and
machinery, as written down, now stands at
£29.733: the stock of goods amounts to
£409.363 ; and there is cash and investments
totalling £131,077. To finance its huge
business the co. has to depend on a lot of
outside money (deposits, etc.), but, as the
chairman told shareholders, the total lia-
bilities of £972.410 “are covered by assets
(including uncalled capital) more Ihan*two-
fold.”- The N.Z. Co-op. Association of
Canterbury has saved hundreds of thousands
of pounds for its means
that the Canterbury farmer has been getting
the maximum value for his products, while
he has been provided with his necessities at
cost price to the Association. There are
other big savings which co-operation can
effect, and this and other co-op. concerns
have united forces to still further extend
their interests to the farmers' advantage.*

, George Robert Nichols, who died at Pen-
rith (N.S.W.) last week, at G 3, was a son
of Charles Hamilton Nichols and grandson
of Isaac Nichols, first postmaster of Aus-
tralia. G. It. Nichols in early life was
engaged in the legal profession. About 30
years ago he settled on a farm- at Llandilo,
some few miles from St. Mary’s. Recently
he had gone in for press-writing, and was
a contributor to The Bulletin under the
pen-name of “Billy Blue.”
Robert Ross, who died in London the
other day from heart failure, was an art
critic and essayist of distinction, and had
lately been art adviser in the Big Smoke to
the Felton Bequest committee. He was
best known as friend, biographer and lit-
erary executor of
Oscar Wilde. Ross
was one of the few
who stuck to Wilde
when the trouble
came. He was Oscar’s
close companion after
his release from
prison, and was with
him in Paris when he
died. Ross was born
in France, wrote on
literature, art and the
drama for the Satur-
day Review and other
papers, acted as a trus-
tee of the National
Gallery, and was
assistant-editor of The
Author, under Wal-
ter Besant. Among his
purchases (stored in
London until the Hun
is licked) for the Fel-
ton Bequest were
“The Garden of Pan,”
Burne-.Tones (price
1150 guineas) and
£4OOO worth of Wil-
liam Blake’s draw-
ings.

retary and Aide-de-
camp to the Governor

Copland King, New Guinea missionary
(Anglican), who died in Sydney lately, aged
00, was a son of the late Archdeacon King,
formerly of Sydney, and a great-grandson
of Phillip Gidley King, third Governor of
N. S. Waps. In 1891 he helped the late
Rev. Maclaren to establish the first
New Guinea mission-station on Dogura Hill
(Bartel Bay), and the pioneers had a hard
fight against the then-little-understood
malaria and other unfamiliar worries. When
Maclaren died King took charge. In 1599
another station was started near the mouth
of the Mamba River, close to the German
border, with the Rev. E. W. M. Hines in
charge, and when Hines retired sic-k King
kept the vineyard flourishing. He remained
thereabouts for 17 years, and was the only
white man who has so far got a working
knowledge of the tongue-tangling local
Binandere dialect. He translated the Scrip-
tures into the native language, and the man
who could do that deserves his halo and harp.
‘‘Chasuble”: It would not surprise some
Melbourne Anglicans if the sudden blow of
the loss of his wife caused Archbishop
Clarke to resign. He is not strong in
physique, and his term has been
long for a prelate appointed late
in life. Some irritation for him
is preparing in the present
Synod. No attempt to impugn
the undeniable ability with
which he has administered the
diocese; but there is likely to
be an attempt to limit arehie-
piscopal functions. The demo-
crats, both clerical and lay,
want power to initiate church
business without it being fil-
tered through the Archbishop’s
fingers. Clarke is firmly opposed
to the overturning of tradition.
Tradition and gaiters are not
easily separated.
The remarkable career of W.
E. Newbury has ended at 91, at
Mundaring (W.A.). He was
the son of a British officer in
India, and he helped to mark
the boundary-line between
Alaska and Canada : after
which he went about the world
looking for fight, and found it
first in Italy under Garibaldi
and then in the last Maori war.
Then he settled down quietly in
the Education Department of
S. Aus. on the invitation of
Governor Ferguson, who had
been his schoolfellow. He put in a quarter-
century of work there, and after reaching
the age limit he enjoyed 18 years of peace
in Yvestralia.
“C.R.W.” writes:—
Langdon Bonython, editor and proprietor of the
Adelaide Advertiser, completed his 70th year on
October 15. He joined the paper as a junior re-
porter in 1864, and became the virtual editor on the
death of Harms over 40 years ago, although he did
not assume the title until after Jeff Stow, the hero
of the voyage of the Forlorn Hope from Darwin to
Broome, left to become a police magistrate. Bony-
thon initiated the Protectionist policy in S. Australia
and preached advanced Liberalism. He has had other
interests, notably the Adelaide School of Mines, of
which he is the real founder and which he has nur-
tured with as much care as though it were his own
property. He has stuck very close to his paper, and
he never had a holiday till about 20 years ago, when
a threatened illness sent him to England (he was
born in London. He has had only, one vacation since.
Despite his 70 years Bonython has full control edi-
torially and in every other way of his paper; yet
he finds time to slip over from Adelaide to Melbourne
twice or thrice a month in his capacity of trustee
oi the Repatriation Fund or chairman of the Literary
Fund, while he never misses a meeting of the School
and Mines Council, and he is also a. leading member
of the State Advisory Council of Education. He
sat in the Federal Parliament for/several rears, being-
returned second on the poll to Kingston (whom he
greatly admired) in 1901, but he lias declined
repeated invitations to enter State politics.
Ignatius O’Keefe, who died the other day
at Launceston (Tas.) was among the first
in the rush to the Zeehan and I,yell gold-
fields when they were discovered. He was
one oi the very few remaining of the old
army ,of alluvial miners who attacked the
deposits in the quartz half a century ago. A
native of Tasmanian, he was 75 years old
when the clock stopped.
Lieut. Harold Forster, K.N., who was
awarded the D.S.M. by the British Govern-
ment, and the Croix de Guerre with palms
b* v fhh French Government, for conspicuous
bravery and devotion to duty in the Zee-
biugge raid, was in charge of the sounding
party that took the necessqry depths and
tossicked for dangers (mines, etc.), prepara-
tory to the great attack. He is a son of
the well-known philanthropist, William For-
ster. who founded, and for many years man-
aged the Society for Homeless Boys in
Hawksburn, Melb. ; and previous to the war
was an officer in the mercantile marine.
Passed out at Sydney last week, a one-
time well-known figure in Sydney, P. B.
Bourke, at 50. While in the Telegraph
Department as correspondence clerk, he
studied for the Bar and was admitted in
188!). After being in practice for about eight
years he got himself dis-barred and placed
on the roll of solicitors, mainly, as he told
this writer, because he could not collect fees
earned. He was a nephew of the late Dan
U Connor, who built great hopes on the suc-
cess of “my nephew, the barrister at the
Bar.”

in that part of Papua. The Scholarly
King lived absolutely alone with the natives,
and his home was little better than a village
hut. The well-thumbed books in his little
library all bore on his work. Beyond this
he apparently had no recreation. His per-
sonal attendants were a middle-aged boy
who had at one time worked on the Banana-
land plantations and his (the boy’s) wife,
a black monstrosity half Hottentot half
Australian gin. They both had the tired
feeling in an acute form. Their work
semed to consist entirely of minding a rooster
and one hen, which wandered at will about
the village. But they complained that this
was really a very exhausting form of labor.

“Hamer”: Another good officer, Lieuten-
ant Frank Williams, was struck
olf the roll of the Ist Battalion in
one of the June stunts which were
only judged worth a line or so of
newspaper type. I can’t give many
biographical details, except to say
that Williams established some-
thing of a record by leaping from
lance-jack to lieutenant in a couple
of weeks when the battalion was
really busy, and he was well liked
by all the men associated with him.
He always looked after his men
before himself, and his readiness
to understand their necessities
arose, without doubt, from his own
experiences as a private. The
Ist Battalion had the misfortune
to lose three very fine officers
within a couple of months—
Humphries, Viccars and Williams.
Judge Fitzhardinge, who is due for
retirement at the end of the year, has
sentenced transgressors and adjusted claims

that during his term on the Bench he had
never known a jury to return an unjust ver-
dict. With his greater knowledge of the
law he might not, at times, have exactly
agreed with the verdicts of juries ; but with
the outside knowledge which they possessed
and which they could not altogether dissoci-
ate from their minds, the juries no doubt
dealt honestly with cases.” All of which

A WAVSIDE CROSS IN FRANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Grey death sat waiting in red leaves that glowed
While morning’s sad white feet passed slowly down
Beside a tall tree standing in the road,
The summer road grown winter-cold and brown.
Far down this road the drums beat evenly
A muffled rhythmic murmur in the rain;
And silent columns marched beneath the tree
Saluting as they passed the hallowed pain.
All through the day the brown men passed the cross,
And all day long the grey shade watched them go ;
And each had measured gain and so-called loss—
Had seen the colored pictures loss could show ;
And heard the murmured songs of careless case
In tune with silken voices soft and sweet;
And loitered in the scented evening breeze
With pleading lips and careless happy feet.
And this was best, this road of death and truth ;
And cars to hear through walls of heedless years
This true song calling down the roads of youth,
The summer roads that shine through hyssop tears.
So each one kept his soul; and saw his way
Made easy for his feet beneath the Christ ;
And hands uplifted to the Rood to-day
Salute again to-morrow’s deathless tryst.
The Shadow rose. It raised saluting hand,
And drew Its sable cloak about his head ;
Its eyes looked far beyond the stricken land—-
“These die not—these die not,” It said.

If the Victorian Parliament grants the re-
quest embodied in the Clergy Discipline Act,
submitted to the Anglican Synod in Mel-
bourne, an ecclesiastical tribunal appointed
by the Anglican gaiters-in-chief will be in-
vested with the powers of the Supreme
Court as regards the summoning of witnesses
to give evidence on oath. Under the old
Ecclesiastical Offences Act the Church can
sack a pilot found guilty of “doctrinal mis-
demeanor” or conduct “productive of scandal

and evil report,” and the allegedly erring
brother is practically deprived of redress at
law. But the Anglican junkers have no
power over mere worshippers. Mrs. Grundy-
Grundy may whisper that she saw the Bev.
Tobias Tufthunter giving the glad eye to
the leading angel of the choir, but if an
ecclesiastical court asks her to give evi-
dence to this effect she can tell it to
submit its head to a lay-reader. The
Anglican authorities claim the right to com-
pel Mrs. Grundy-Grundy to attend and speak
on oath, on the ground that this is necessary
to protect laborers in the vineyard from
“tittle tattle.” The power sought for
would, if necessary, be exercised over
members of other sects, or plain, un-
varnished heretics. If the weak-kneed
Lawson ■ Government sanctions this attempt
upon the part of a religious body to
usurp the functions of the civil courts a
joyous precedent will be established. Some
lay members of the synod realise this. A
parson who has been slandered has the same
redress as any other citizen, and the Angli-
can Church has no more right to claim
civil court status for its privately-con-
stituted tribunals than has the Victorian
Football Association or the League of
Ancient Mariners. A similar claim on be-
half of the R.C. Church could be relied upon
to produce a howl of indignation that would
deafen the Commonwealth.
James Delehanty, who has imposed on
himself the task of calculating S.A.’s
liquor bill, announces with pain that
it is again on the up grade. In the year to
June 30 it was (on his figures) over 1} mil-
lions sterling, an increase of nearly £lOO,OOO
on the year before, though it is still a long
way behind the gay days of before the war.
The most striking item in Delehanty’s fig-
ures is one that does not interest him speci-
ally. S.A. beer (£750,000), S.A. wine
(£110,000) and spirits (very largely S.A.
brandy) £411,000, make up so much of the
total that the rest is hardly worth counting.
South Aus. is a blue-ribbon sort of State,
but if ever it does want to go on a jag it
will not need to do any importing.

A legal decision that must be unique
comes from Finland. An old and enthusiastic
sinner, in his will, left his property to Satan.
The family of deceased tried to show that
the bequest was absurd ; but the Court said
a man had a light to do as he pleased with
his estate. Not knowing the precise address
of the legatee, the Bench directed that the
land bequeathed should be allowed to lie
waste—to go to the Devil, in fact.

Uncle Samuel hasn’t conscripted his nurses
yet; but he is thinking hard about it, for the
volunteer supply, especially in the home
camps, isn’t large enough to prevent a good
deal of overwork. Whether she enlists or not
the American nurse is on better clover than
the Australian. Apart from her better pay
there isn’t for her merely the choice between
hospital nursing and private nursing. There’s
a whole lot of things comprised within the
general term “ivelfare work.” It may be
slumming, paid for by some millionaire-sup-
ported society buying a little insurance for
its sins; it may be school work, including
truancy inspection, for truancy is found to
be mostly a matter of sickness or domestic
neglect; it may be first-aid work at factory
or yards; it may be outside work among some
big firm’s employees.
“Square Axe”: “Camelero’s” yarn (B.
29/8/M8) of Brig.-Gen-
eral _ llyrie’s method of
putting down swearing
in the regiment reminds
me. A N. S. Wales
coastal steamer was tied
up in one of the North-
ern rivers. The captain
was on the bridge mak-
ing himself amiable to
some lady visitors, and
the crew were having
dinner on deck for’ard.
Suddenly some hot soup
was spilt on the bos’n,
and he blisteringly pro-
tested. The indignant
skipper leaned over the
rail, and using liis hurri-
cane voice, he thus ad-
monished the blas-
phemer : “That’s enough
of that language
down there! If you
want to well
swear, go down in the
hold.”
The usual habit of Minister’s approving
anything put before them by initialling has
been found fault with by a Port Adelaide
court. The S.M. was shown an authority to
prosecute initialled “W.H.H.,” which in
departmental circles is recognised as mean-
ing W. H. Harvey, Minister of Education;
but it might, as the magistrate pointed out,
mean any one of a whole herd of other
people. (It might even stand for William
Heaven-born Hughes.) Not being anxious
to tie the case up with red tape, the Court
accepted the initials on condition that the
full name should be signed later.
From an Australian in New York :
Uncle Sam is sending some of his niggers to the
war; but he’s not mixing them. Blacks and whites
went to Australia in the same ship in the Great
White Fleet; but they don’t go to Europe in the
same regiment. For one thing President Wilson has
to depend very largely upon the South ; and the South
won’t let down the sliprails at all. “There’s no
half-way house on this road,” says the Southerner.
“If you go a step you’ve got to go the whole journey.”
There are now somewhere about 15,000,000 negroes in
the States, and the race problem gets thicker every
year. The only consolation the Southerner can
squeeze out of the situation is that Sambo is moving
steadily nortli and taking the problem with him. It

haa had queer results that you wouldn’t expect.
For instance, in some of the southern States com-
pulsory education has only just been introduced. The
fact was that the white bosses dreaded the very
probable results of nigger education; yet they
couldn’t discriminate between the two races, and
therefore deliberately put up with illiteracy among
their own youngsters. In the North, where the pro-
blem isn’t yet acute, niggers are admitted to the
general hospitals; but in the South they are kept
in their own wards —just as their youngsters are
kept in-their own schools. On that point a Southern
nurse, who had just come up to, our military train-
ing camp, said a thing with a lot of meaning in it.
“Oh, yes, the niggers: have some nurses of their own
color, like they have some doctors; but there are not
enough of them, and white nurses have to Work
among them. But wardsmen are kept to do most
of the jobs. We’ve got, we find, to limit the actual
physical contact of white nurse and negro patient
as much as possible.” But even the appearance of
discolored sister as nurse and of brother as doctor
merely thickens the race problem; for these two
are coming between the little nigger and an early
death, and thus improving the effective birthrate.
The actual birthrate has always been as good as it
mostly is among people who don’t worry at all about
to-morrow’s dinner. How it’s all going to end
nobody knows. Even the educated and most intelli-
gent Southerners have given up the riddle. They
just meet any new situation as it arises, all the
time, however, building the fence between the two
races higher and stronger.

“Bad Australian” : England is rapidly
getting wise to the Australian language.
Passing Harry Hall’s clothing . emporium,
London, a day or two ago, I noticed a pair
of Bedford cords labelled: —
REAL DINKUM BAGS, £4/4/-
And a board fence in one of the suburbs
bears this legend, in white paint:—

To which a postcript has been added in

“Hamer”: The Y.M.C.A. and similar in-
stitutions maintain a strenuous fight with
the Devil over the thousands of soldiers
who are constantly adrift in London. As a
matter of fact the Y.M.C.A. gets a very poor
look-in with the majority of the leave-men
until the cash is gone; then the numerous
free entertainments come in very handily.
But there is a moony lot who are hard
work for both the Devil and the Y.M.C.A.
Some of them seem to spend all their
leave sitting on the steps in front
of the War Chest Club in Horseferry-road.
They apparently regard this as a bit of Aus-
trail a, and feel themselves .safe there; the
only thing that has been known to move
them was “buckshee” tickets to a boxing
tournament. Brown, of my platoon, was one
of the front-steppers, and each day as I
passed-and asked him how he was enjoying
himself, he replied, “Not so bad.” He was
oil, view all day . for a fortnight, and then
went back to France, grumbling that a man
couldn’t get extension just when a man
was beginning to enjoy himself.
A BLACK-OUT.

SHE: “ Indeed? At your show last night I

From headquarters
The fighting- of the Australians on August 6 on the
Western Front was the most successful and least
costly we have experienced. My own battalion, for
instance, captured seven officers, 500 men,' 10 field-
guns, 30 machine-guns, 12 minenwerfers, an anti-
tank gun and large quantities of material and stores.
I cite our own case, because I know it best, but it is
typical of all the Australian battalions which were
engaged;.and we had only four men killed!

Melbourne’s annual squabble over the
t*aud Mayoralty was about as bitter as
y ear - The contest was between
‘Kill” Cabena and Stapley, who when he
was beaten took retirement very much to
heart, and heatedly referred to Melbourne’s
system of choosing its mayor as “a disgrace
to the city.” He wasn’t so far out at that.
Cabena, an Irishman from Londonderry, has
served 15 long, dreary years in the City
Council, and was one of the also-rans last
year, when Ilennessy and Stapley fought out
the finish. Cabena used to be in the leather-
importing business in Melbourne for many
years, but retired into private dividend-
drawing life some time ago.

Soon after the Prince of Wales visited
the I ope, a few weeks ago, Colonel Craig, a
conspicuous Orangeman, upended himself in
the House of Commons to ask whether the
visit was made on the advice of the British
Government. Bonar Law replied : “Yes, sir
the Government takes full responsibility for
the visit.” The object of the visit was, of
course, to show appreciation of the Pope’s
neutrality, which is a good deal impugned.

Ferdinand of Bulgaria did the orthodox
thing when lie abdicated in favor of his
son. The strength of monarchy lies in its
hereditary character, provided the character
can be kept up. A one-man dynasty, like
that of Napoleon 1., or Napoleon 111., or
Otho in Greece, or Zimri in Palestine, is a
weak plant. It is without stability or title-
deeds, like Adam before Cain was born. A two-
man dynasty begins to be a little less of an
upstart, and the royal gang at Sofia gets
into the two-man category. It was an acci-
dent. Now it begins to be an institution.

“L.E.” (London) :
Australia House, where Andy Fisher holds a court
in opposition to Windsor, was opened on Saturday,
George V. being permitted a leading part in the
impressive ceremony. Mrs. Hughes (she is the wife
of W. M. Hughes, who is bucking-up old England in
,its hard trials and saving the Empire in his spare
time) welcomed the King (not Andy) and presented
him with a golden key. A duplicate key was handed
to the Queen by J. Cook. Many scions of noble
families were present in all their glory. It
was a great Imperialistic day. Historic
orations were delivered, but not by the pawn-
broker who had advanced the money to build the
palace for Andy Fisher, Billy Hughes, Jokook
and other dukes from Woolingabby or thereabouts.
After the addresses their Majesties walked through
the building, accompanied by high-caste stamp-
stickers, and expressed their gracious approval of the
woodwork. Then came the presentations in the
library, among those honored being Frank Anstey, who
took his turn with other eminent statesmen and
officials. Their Majesties also graciously appeared on
the balcony for a few moments to receive the plaudits
of the crowd in the Strand. At a later stage our
great little leader, Billy Hughes, made a character-
istic speech to the soldiers. “I see,” he began, “as
in a crystal glass, the burning sands of Mesopotamia,
the blood-stained fields of Flanders,” and ended a
glorious burst of equally striking images. J. Cook
was served with a knighthood, and previously
Hughes was served with a writ- for libel.
The press notices were excellent. One enthusiastic
journalist gracefully referred to Jokook as the “hand-
some Minister of the Navy.” What do you know
about it ? Anyhow, Australia should be proud of her
representatives abroad. They are doing splendid work
in making the world safe for departmental officials ;
and by their loyal attitude they are doing much to
justify Bernard Shaw’s prophecy that Ireland and the
Dominions will save the monarchy when Groat
Britain calls for a republic.

SHE: “Your friend is just too sweet for

HE: “Well, maybe. He settled ten Huns

’ I .G. : I have been cogitating over the
fact that Victoria’s Treasurer has asked the
various public hospital committees to con-
sider the expediency of working their nurses
48 hours weekly instead of the present 57 or
more. The committees mostly say they can’t
afford it, but considering the arduous nature
of the toil and the trifling wages the nurses
get, somebody certainly ought to afford it.
THE PACEMAKERS.
BILLJIM: “Shake it up, Fritzie! You're on the last turn for home!"
Treasurer McPherson, by the way, isn’t a
Laborite or even a bigoted democrat, which
moves me to inquire what the Labor Party
or the Trades Hall Council would say if the
Amalgamated Engineers or the Builders’
Laborers (basic wage, 60s. per week) were
asked to bog in for 57 hours a week as a
steady thing. I may have overlooked the cir-
cumstance, but so far I have no recollection
of any Labor leaders making a fuss about
nurses’ hours or those of Mental Hospital
attendants, which are worse.

The stained-glass windows in Father
Robinson’s new church of Our Lady of
Victories, at Camberwell (Vic.), came from
Birmingham (Eng.). The organ (to
arrive) is being built in Ireland. The altar-
steps are from Sicily, the reredos-columns
came from Italy, the brasswork from Japan
and the ceilings from the U.S. The marble
fittings had a narrow escape of being Aus-
tralian products. Father Robinson spent a
good deal of hard cash in attempting to get
the good work started in a Gippsland
quarry; but he found transport conditions so
fierce and the State Government so apathetic
that he finally gave up and got the stuff
cheaper from overseas. Still, hie regards
with satisfaction the massive granite
columns at the main entrance of the church
—beautiful S.A. stone that is superior to
the best Aberdeen granite, both in grain and
texture. And the stone walls throughout are
Australian—like the money that bought the
whole pile.

“A Trooper Billjim”: The newly-arrived
Billjim has now to go through an equitation
course, the first spasm being instruction on
wooden steeds. You can imagine how our
lads go off when they are led to the merry-
go-round to be “taught” how to saddle and
unsaddle and learn £he art of grooming. The
other morning one of the boys was going
through the farce (“gawk-act,” they call it)
and almost dropped dead when told to
imagine the thing in front of him to be the
live goods and to carry on and treat it as
such. “Wot in th’ h yer mean?” he
gasped and glared at the master of wooden
horse. “Come along, man,” blustered the
instructor. “Use your nut! Imagine you’ve
had your ride, dismounted and unsaddled.
Now carry on, rub him down and pat his
neck to show you’re pleased with him.”
“ ’Strooth !” whispered the Australian horse-
man, and carried on grimly, but the instruc-
tor’s eyes stood out like a crab’s when he
saw his pupil put the boot into his horse for
all he was worth. “ ’Ere what d’you do that
for?” he roared. “Why, the cow tried to
bite me!” sneered Bill.

“0.C.8.”: The other day I received a
small package containing a fountain-pen. On
opening it a short note on which was written
the following fell out:—
Cobber, —This came through my post with your
name torn off the outside. I opened it and found
your address on the inside, so will forward it on,
hoping it reaches you safely.
No signature, no address, iio date, no indica-
tion as to the bloke who had repacked, re-
addressed and redirected the gift. The post-
mark showed “Field Post Office,” and the
Australian crowd is, as I write, working
itself to exhaustion in securing Amiens. Yet
my unknown cobber found or made time to
recognise a moral claim of one digger on
another.
ouglily awake by Tuesday
noon. Presently enter the
stupendous person, huge,
red face, 15 stone pro-
bably, tight-fitting tweed
coat with vest, low
collar, small tie, small
rimmed straw-decker, and
pincenez. The stupendous
one sat down opposite my
favorite nut, and the nut
blinked at it for a moment.
A liberal light that was
almost sanity gleamed in
his countenance, he leaned
forward, slapped the new-
comer jovially on the knee,
and said, “Hello, hello,
Blanket, ole chap ! Where
the devil did you spend the
night?” The stupendous
person glared with pirati-
cal fury, and the nut’s eye
fell for the first time on
the huge one’s nether
habiliment. It was a skirt.
He put up his monocle
and inspected at leisure.
"Oh, come, I say, Blanket,
old chap,” he said. “Ex-
cuse me,” answered the
stupendous person frigidly.
“I am not Blanket, old
chap.” “No,” replied the
nut more soberly. “No, of
course not; but” (more
brightly) “by Jove, it was
a near thing, wasn’t it?”
“Got ’Em’’: “Ziff” (B. 8/10/18) asserts
that exemption badges are being worn by the
employees, from messengers upwards, of a
private cable company.” I think he has been
misinformed. There is only one privatfly-
owned cable company in Australia, and as I
happen to be one of the staff I can reason-
ably suspect myself of knowing what I am
talking about. The only men wearing ex-
emption badges are those who have volun-
teered for active service and have been
rejected by the Defence Department as indis-
pensable. As for the statement that even
messengers are wearing badges, it’s the first I
have heard about it. Pearce’s Department
isn t as bad as all that
*L.L.W.”: In N. S. Wales, once in a long
while a bored doctor calls on the school
kiddies and examines them. Certain recom-
mendations are made to the parents of “de-
fectives,” and there the matter ends as far
as the Department is concerned. In Banana-
land they go a step further, and then drop it.
The parents are requested to have, sa.v, bad
teeth in their children’s mouths attended to.
After a certain interval they are politely
requested to state whether the teeth have
been attended to. If the reply is “No,”
then another polite circular is sent to say that
if the work is not done owing to the parents’
inability to foot the bill, the Government is
willing to pay. A Bananaland teacher of
wide experience tells me that very few
parents avail themselves of the Government’s
charity, but some dilatory ones, after the
receipt of the last polite circular, do the
right thing. Unfortunately the majority
simply ignore the medical reports and the
subsequent circulars, and as there is nothing
unpleasant coming to them, young Bill and
little Mabel have to pay later with pain and
ill-health.

A spirit iron, some old blue delf ;
And a carpet of dreams were thick and sweet,
The joys of to-morrow pulse and beat.

With a floor of turquoise the harbor's set,
Where gay little ferries in golden shoes,
Slip and curtsey in ones and twos.
There are dishes to wash, and a bed to make,

Songs of lovers this long time dead,
Ere kitchenette and front room were wed.
Between the stars and the street it is set,
This balcony room with its kitchenette,
And the song of the stars and the noise of the street
Blend in my heart till they form its beat.
The stars arc wise, and the stars are high,
But the city’s courage flings to the sky
A ladder of gold, each rung a slain
Hope that arose and went on again.
Asparagus tips in the omelette,

lower ones. The Australian Federal law doesn’t
strike the married person or the one with dependants
who earns £2OO or less; the English one begins to

figures the Victorian will pay in his two taxes

11s. 2d. if the income is from property; while the
figures in England are £22 10s. for personal exertion
and £3O for property. Allowing for the difference
in the exemption the Briton with a small income
pays Is. where the Victorian pays 3)d. or 4d. But
as regards the £20,000 income from property the
figure is £8462 in Victoria against £9437 in
England, so on the upper register the Briton pays
la. where the Victorian pays lOfd. There is very
little money in
being a poor man
in England nowa-
days. He is got
at in quite unex-
pected ways. For
instance, if his
income is £l3O
lie pays nothing;
but if it is £l3l
he gets an exemp-
tion of only £l2O
and pays on £ll,
or he used to do so,
Now he is allowed
to give the Gov-
ernment the excess
income and retire
inside the Hinden-
burg line of ex-
emption. In the
same way a man
with £405 is per-
mitted to make
the Treasury a
Christmas-box of
the £5 and then
pay at the lower
rate on the £4OO,
and save a trifle
by doing it. Lloyd
George ropes in
one person out of
every 14 for income-tax. Hughes and Watt get
at only one person out of 21.
David Oman, who has had a short experi-
ence as Vic. Minister for Agriculture and a
long one among the rural producers of the
Western District, has decided to avoid a lot
of later criticism by selling the State’s ex-
perimental farm at Wyturn. For years Min-
ister after Minister lias had to apologise for
an expensive share in the administration of
Wyuna, and Oman reckons that the time is
now as ripe as it ever will be for standing
from under. The accumulated debt on the
farm for the past three years has been
equal to the value of the land —which is
vastly encouraging when you happen to men-
tion State enterprises. Financial considera-
tions apart, however, the officials of the
Lands Department are probably congratulat-
ing themselves on having at last discovered
a Minister whom they have been able to con-
vince, by displaying their melancholy records,
that the Wyuna acres are not suitable for
experimental farm-work. Which is also
vastly enlightening.
Some months ago, to keep up wheat-
production, the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment decided to guarantee the cockies 4s.
per bushel for the next crop, provided it
was delivered at one of Ma’s railway sta-
tions —this to prevent the grain going into
that alien country, Victoria. The result is
that the cocky is likely to strip all the wheat
he can for grain and cut as little as possible
for hay. This is a rather disastrous develop-
ment, as the stocks of hay in the country are
lighter than they have ever been, and if a
drought comes along—as it has a nasty habit
of doing—losses will be solid. The country
was eaten bare of all accumulations in 1914-
15, and since then, although a good lot of
crop was cut for hay, the mice have digested
most of it. Having got hard up against this
unpleasant position, the Holman Govern-
ment has now made an offer to the cockies of
an advance of £2 per ton up to 20 tons on
hay that they cut over and above what is
required for their own use. One hundred
thousand pounds, it is alleged, have been put
aside for this, although it is not long since one
eminent financier of the illustrious Cabinet
announced that he did not know where the
money was coming from to pay the wheat
bonus. He might have added that he wasn’t
sure where any money was likely to be
found in the Treasury after salaries and
expenses and one thing and another (includ-
ing Ministerial excursions to England,
France, America and any other fancied spot
on the map) have been paid.
The announcement that N.S.W. Minister
Beeby proposes to take a half-year’s
holiday in the U.S. and draw his full
salary, while leaving his work here undone,
reads like superlative effrontery. And the
fact that his expenses will be charged to the
taxpayer reads worse. The Government’s
thin excuse is that Beeby goes to inquire into
the welfare of the U.S. workers (which isn’t
his job), into U.S. profit-sharing, co-opera-
tion, the development of industrial matters

could get far more information from official
and unofficial publications than he will ever
get by wandering through factories and fixing
his eye on machines and making disjointed
notes which he will never use about profit-
sharing schemes that are already expounded
in print; and gazing on Niagara and the big
trees of Yosemite. Beeby and his colleagues
don’t know how to use what information they
already have (or haven’t), otherwise they
wouldn’t have required to add nearly
£7,000,000 to the public debt last year—more
than the profligacy of all the other States
combined.
Something new in the way of a
“developmental line” was introduced by
a solemn deputation which waited on
Victorian Public Works Minister Robinson
to request that provision be made in the Tram-
ways Bill for the extension of the Barker’s-
road (Melb.) tramline to bring it to the
gates, of Fawkner Cemetery. The leader
explained that the graveyard trustees were
anxious to make their burial-ground “more
popular,” and argued that if there was an
up-to-date electric tram to convey mourners
the boneyard would acquire much more cus-
tom than now comes its way. That is to
say, it would become a popular resort, and
the oldest inhabitant would agree to peg out
a claim more promptly than usual. Robin-
son promised to think over the suggestion.
If the scheme has his sanction the only thing
necessary will be a few bright ideas from
the Publicity Department and a helping-
hand from the Tourist Bureau.
From South Africa, wffiere Spanish influ-
enza has flattened out the entire population :
As the disease is carried in the air it is most difii-
cut to check.
At all costs W. M. Hughes ought to rush to
the rescue and blow it out.
Senator Needham was so impressed with
W ebster’s pamphlet, “Three Years of Postal
Administration in Australia,” that (accord-
ing to Federal Plansakd) he has been sound-
ing .the Government as to whether it has
considered the advisability of filming the
booklet. Needham reckons that the produc-
tion would rival Ambassador Gerard’s “My
Four Years in Germany.”
The important lesson to be drawn from
tiie High Court’s decision, that the Federal
Arbitration law is in part unconstitutional
is that the Commonwealth shouldn’t have
any constitution. The United States has
one, and it is a nuisance. Britain hasn’t
any, and gets on better without it. The Cold
Country has ordinary laws which can be
amended as required, whereas a constitution
is an extraordinary law which can be
amended many years after the need for
amendment has appeared, it taking much time
and legislation and referendum to wake the
drugged elephant of Procedure and get it on
its feet and shake it up. The Australian
states want constitutions—uniform ones sup-
plied by the central authority so that one
legal interpretation will interpret the whole
lot. These would tell them exactly how far
they could go. As for the Commonwealth it
should go the whole hog.
A strenuous note was struck at the Syd-
ney Eight Hours banquet re the wickedness
of any idea of “crushing Germany.” It
was “unchristian.” This seems rather pre-
mature, as the German is still busy “crush-
ing” Belgium, Roumania, a good bit of
France, Russia, Serbia and Montenegro, and
a corner of Italy. It is like buying sweet-
meats for the tame bear while the animal is
still wild, and raging exceedingly and declar-
ing that lie will rage permanently and
devour all and sundry. A German states-
man has just stated that his countrymen will
go on crushing to such an extent that they
will slay “millions” before they leave Bel-
gium and France and get back into their
own country —mostly non-combatants, of
course, because there aren’t exactly “mil-
lions” of soldiers in that restricted area to
slay. In order that the pacifists may be
better able to take a dispassionate view of
the case, one or two leading members of the
brotherhood might have a leg amputated—
compulsorily of course—without chloroform,
interned Hums doing the work. Then they
might see both sides of the case. A good
many of our soldiers have met with that
sort of Hun humor.
“Glen Huntly” : Whatever may be thought
of Labor’s attitude toward the war, it is not
more unreasonable than Toryism’s attitude
toward Labor. When Acting Prime Minister
Watt moved that the Reps, should throw its
collective hat in the air because Bulgaria had
come in out of the wet, Frank Tudor
seconded the motion. Next day the Argus
grunted : “When peace comes, Mr. Tudor and
his associates will share in its advantages.
But it is impossible as public men for them
to claim any part in its glories, and a sense
of decency at least should prevent them from
joining in rejoicings at the success of our
arms.” What would the A nous have said if
Tudor had refused to rejoice? Anyhow, a
few thousand men who, rightly or wrongly,
favor Tudor and his associates are helping to
gain the glories which the Argus apparently
reckons should be the exclusive property of
the shell-back party.
Gunn, the youthful-looking Labor leader
in S.A. Assembly, lately proposed an increase
in the salaries of members. Premier Peake,
however, wet-blanketed the suggestion by
pointing out that members were prevented
voting on matters in which they had a practi-
cal pecuniary interest; but the motion, he
thought, could be referred to the next Parlia-
ment. The supporters of Gunn’s proposal
then began to lose interest. Peake himself
had the idea that members were not paid
sufficiently at £200; but as ’increases in
salaries had to be denied to civil servants it
was the worst possible time to ask more
money for members of Parliament. When
Uncle put up the shutters at the old address
lie didn’t know what suffering he was likely
to cause.
THE CIRCLE OF KNOWLEDGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mr. Beeby is going to spend money on a trip
to the United States, under the pretext of gather-
ing information concerning Labor questions about
which only a few months ago the cables were repre-
senting Mr. Holman as instructing the American
politicians.” —Daily paper.
Knowledge is power, as politicians know.
A\ e must find out; and someone lias to go
Around the world to pluck the fruits that grow
On information’s broad and spreading tree,
Which only flourishes across the sea,
At very great expense to you and me.
But lately, Holman, wise in Labor’s pain,
Paused by the broad Atlantic to explain
All that had- been and well might be again;
And as Australia paid the highest price
To make and keep a worker’s paradise,
His words were curry to the Yankee’s rice.
. Now Beeby goes upon a mission clear,
With pockets full and wide-expanded ear,
To that same land to hear what he can hear
Of the last echoes that have rolled and spread
About the place where Washington was bred—
In fact, to find out just what Holman said.
And so, while oceans roll and wavelets beat
And pleasant days go by on well-paid feet,
The circle of our knowledge grows complete.
I'.S.A. will give us tip for tip.
While runs a train or voyages a ship
There must be wise excuses for each trip.
All that we want to know might chance to fall
From ready lips if we but made a call
A mile away at the Trade Unions Hall.
Avaunt! Get work ! Take the suggestion hence !
3 he need is urgent and the call intense.
Is this an hour in which to save expense?

increasing the energy and size of the sound-waves.
It should be understood that in the process of record-

were, and translated into a microscopic line engraved in
wax, and that undoubtedly they are reduced both in
energy and size during the process. Also that when the

ACID STOMACHS NEED MAGNESIA.
Drugs may give temporary relief from the
pain which usually results from an excess of
acid in the stomach, but drugs do not elimin-
ate the acid, and in consequence the pain
returns—worse than before. To effect a cure
you must first eliminate the acid, which is
the cause of all the trouble, and a sure way
to accomplish this is to take a little bisurated
magnesia after your meals. This quickly
neutralises the harmful acid, prevents the
food turning sour and fermenting, soothes
and heals the inflamed stomach, and enables
you to again eat and enjoy the foods you
fancy, secure in the knowledge that no pain
or discomfort will result. Of course it will
be understood that ordinary forms of mag-
nesia, such as the citrates or sulphates, will
not accomplish these happy results, neither
will crude mixtures of bismuth and magnesia.
\ou must get the bisurated magnesia, which
is a form prepared specially for use in cases
of digestive and stomach trouble. This can
readily be obtained of high-class 'chemists
everywhere in both powder and tablet form,
the latter being especially suitable for travel-
lers anil others compelled to take meals aw#
from home.—Advt.

“Tropical Druid”: From his enfry into
precarious Papuan life until he was turned into a
roast or boiled joint (rarely did a man ever die
naturally from old age) the simple brown man was
ruled in his every action by the blood-stained pourri-
pcurri men. His boyhood, his early manhood, his
entry into the full rights of a tribesman, the birth of
his children, the making of his garden, the harvest-

ing- of his crop, the “removal” of his unpopular
friends, the purchase of an extra wife, his share in
the wars of the tribe, in sickness or in health, the
sorcerer stood over him always. And always the
wonder-worker had his hand out for payment. He
was in the front of everything; he talked with the
dead, foretold the future, prepared charms for every
imaginable sort of contingency (good or evil). To
the star-eyed maids who had frolicked unwisely he
was a friend indeed. In the domain of medicine
and surgery he was the stand-by of the tribe, and
could be always sure of a sympathetic audience
every time he “removed” a broken earthenware cook-
ing-pot, or other pain-provoking trifle, from the
interior of some anguished brother who had feasted
too lavishly. If he failed to cure the patient he
could side-step the responsibility of the death by
giving out that a strange devil, a particular pal of
their tribe’s greatest enemy, had got in his dastardly
work before he (their own medicine-man) had been
called to the patient. He suggested that the respon-
sibility lay with the person who had been dilatory, and
it was a hundred to one that some of the sorrowing
relatives of the deceased would tap the delinquent
on the skull with a disc-club and plant him with the
first deceased, so that “he could apologise.” A
popular performance with the unsavory old wizards
was the practise of “clairvoyaney,” and the “dis-
covery” of the hiding-place of stolen articles. While the
common brethren were absent from the village at the
gardens, the sorcerer would annex one individual’s
pig- net or other valuable property and hide it in
another person’s house. When the victim discovered
hi’ loss he told the whole village about it, generally
ftom the platform in front of his house, leaping and
brandishing a spear and pouring out the most awful
and bloodcurdling threats. Then he would consult
the magician, and the old rascal would throw himself
into a trance. Attired in all his ill-gotten jewellery
he would walk around the victim’s dwelling, chant-
ing some weird dirge in a language unknown to his
tribe. Then, filling his mouth with betel and lime,
he would chew steadily until he had a supply of the
blood-red juice, and with this lie would spray the
house-posts. This completed he would commence a
one-legged dance around the building, while he
chanted some unknown spell until he collapsed.
Now he would froth at the mouth, twist and turn and
tremble, stand on his head, twitch his muscles and
101 l his eyes in the most frightful manner, while
the entranced audience waited breathless for the
spirits of the dead to speak. Suddenly, the pourri-
pourri man would go limp and apparently lifeless
and the spirits” would voice the name of the thief
and the place where the missing article was hidden.
An accused was usually given a funeral via the
stone-ovens. There is still a lot of devil-work prac-
tised in the outside places of New Guinea.

“FY7”: “M.P.” says he cannot decide
whether it is the sight or smell of their dead which
frightens horses (B. 22/8/’] S). My experience is
that it is the smell, especially if it is fresh blood.
Ail animals are strangely affected by this. When I
was a youngster one of my jobs was to yard the
milkers, morning and evening, on a Barcoo station.
One night l brought them in on a forbidden track
by the killing-yard. The leading matron caught a
whiff from the gory head and sundries of a beast
which were thrown in a pile outside the yard. That
settled it. The whole mob went wild and
capered in a maddened circle about tin? pile, uttering
sounds which I had thought respectable married cows
incapable of.

“Far-West”: “Oscar” says' (B. 5/9/T8)
that Sturt’s desert-pea will not transplant. He is
wrong. Last winter I came across three of these
plants about an inch high on the common and
removed them to my garden. For about a month
they did not show any appreciation of the shift;
then they went ahead, and when sum-
mer came two of the plants measured
about Bft. in diameter and the third
was about half that size. All three were
one mass of beautiful scarlet-and-black
flowers. The pea is cultivated a good
deal in far western N. S. Wales, and
about nine out of every ten plants have
been transplanted from the surrounding
hills and plains. When digging out
care must be taken that the roots are
not injured, for if they are injured, and
especially if the tap-root is broken or
cut, there is no earthly chance of get-
ting the plant to grow. Further, it
seems essential to leave all the dirt pos-
sible on the roots. As far as I can
ascertain, all attempts to grow them
have proved futile if the roots, were
bare of home earth. If “Oscar” keeps
on trying he may in time get some of
Sturt's pea to grow on the coastal dis-
tricts, but I think he Mull be lucky if
he does. The plants do not grow in wet
climates, and amateurs often kill their
chances by giving them too much water.
There are four varieties, the flowers of
each differing in color. The most com-
mon is the scarlet and black, but there are also
white blossoms, pink ones and blue ones, all of
winch grow fairly abundantly in the far-west of
N. g. Wales.

“Melaleuca” : The domestic bee was first
impoited and introduced to the eucalypt in Australia
in 1834. The Speck claimed the first hatch, which
consisted of one swarm only. The Australian air
evidently agreed with the insects, for it is recorded
that in the first year the hive produced 16 swarms.
From Hobart samples were sent to other parts of the
island and' to the adjacent States. Ronald Gunn, the
Speck’s premier naturalist of the ’fifties, has left
testimonials to the effect that all the bees in Aus-
tralia, at any rate up to 1855, had sprung from the
single hive imported in 1834. The praise for bring-
ing them out must be given to Dr. T. B. Wilson

“MeNorth” : The high price of soap need
not worry the niggers of Torres Strait. On many
of the islands there is an indigenous weed the stalks of
which, cut up fine and rubbed together in water,
produce quite a decent lather. Missus Islander often
makes use of this “soap-plant,” and she assures me
that it does not injure the fabric of the family linen
in the least. The vegetable is a low, spindly-looking
evergreen with small, narrow leaves. I think it
belongs to the retusa family.

“IL”: In a recent journey through the
northern and eastern goldfields of Westralia D. A. Her-
bert (State botanical and pathological assistant)
came upon an unknown poisonous plant, Eremophila
willsii, at Sturt Meadows (40 miles north of Leon-
ora). The vegetable belongs to the shrubby wild
fuchsias, which have been so deadly to stock in the
West. A gramme of its ground-up leaves was tried on
two rats, and both died in less than 24 hours.

“X.Y.”: Outback fires sometimes have a
very surprising origin, and one recorded recently on
the North Coast would seem to add a new terror to
insurance cos. which take risks on straw crops. A
farmer had been using a three-furrow disc plough,
and on finishing his day’s work he put the imple-
ment on its side on the headland in order to have no
difficulty in oiling it when he started work next day.
The discs (which are not really discs at all, but con-
cave, shallow bowls) were very bright over their
whole internal surfaces, and the farmer covered them
over with some old chaff-bags, to keep off the dew or
a passing shower. Next day was very hot, and the
cocky did not resume work till almost midday. Then
he removed the bags from the surfaces of the discs,
but let them remain on the frame while he oiled
up. This done he proceeded to hitch his team, and
was about to start when he saw the bags redden into
flames. As he was a non-smoker and had no matches
about him, the only explanation was that the sun
heating the discs they acted as concave mirrors, re-
flecting and condensing the rays to three respective
foci, and that the bags were within one or more of
these foci. This incident calls to mind the fact that the
system now so fashionable of glazing windows and doors
with leaded lights in which “bosses” figure (and these
are but rough pleno-convex lenses) is not without its
dangers. Where such lights are shaded by a reason-
ably wide verandah the danger would be remote, but
where there is nothing to prevent the sun shining at
90deg. or more from the horizon directly upon one
or more of these glass bosses, with hangings of cotton
“casement cloth” placed just about in focus, the risk
is well worth considering.

“Hamilton” : Cattle-duffing in Central
Queensland has received a bit of a jolt from Justice
Lukin, who has just handed out four years to a
few of the talent. His Honor said that he could
not ignore the fact that cattle stealing was rife and
on the increase. Jurors, for some unexplained rea-
son, were not inclined to express their judgments,
and this was an encouragement to lawlessness. One
of the “duffers” before his Honor had got away with
a paltry LGOO worth of beef before being roped in.
As the culprits were men of means the Judge ruled
out fines in favor of. hard labor, and he made an
order for the return of the stolen cattle.
Ida I). : In a North-West towri the grey
wallaby is called one-gwai; boorigan is the native-
cat, and murain the native-dog. Boorima is any
other dog presumably that introduced by white
men. In this connection we have also varraman. a
horse; and dimba, sheep. In ' a country
wheie is no native animal which gives milk
for human consumption, and in a towri where
the terminal “bri” almost always means
water, it is interesting to note that minim-
bri is a cow. One wonders what Binghi
thought when he first saw our national god-
dess performing her duties. Bulla-belah are
the white butterflies well known over most
of Australia. Nebi is the home of the
snake; koiyong is a white man’s camping-
ground, and gamalally means blaekfellow
bui ied here. In Central Australia the rock
wallaby is called cantoo, and ookwa-cumbi is
the water-bag which the natives make from
the skin of an animal. It must be remem-
bered that these names are spelt as nearly as
possible from sound; Binghi uses some gut-
turals and liquids which a mere white could
never reproduce.
“H.W.F.”: I can endorse “L.L.’s” (B.
l/8/’18) statement of wild birds becoming tame
when treated kindly and gently. The following birds
have been round my camps, all fairly quiet: honey-
eaters, pipits, tree creepers, babblers, finches, robins,
magpie-larks, willy wagtails, jacky winter, blue
wrens, tits, bell magpies, white-ringed choughs, mag-
pies, noisy mina (soldier-bird), rosellas, butcher-
birds, jackass and harmonious thrush. The thrushes
I have got so tame that they alight on my head and
shoulders and feed from my hand, like the member
for the district when he triennially lobs round for
my vote. The birds mostly leave in nesting season,
but they come back in the autumn.

“D.F.”: An Australian with a first-class
chance of becoming extinct is the Bass Straits wom-
bat, which George Bass discovered on Flinders Island
in 1798. It is a distinct variety, smaller and
darker than the mainland wombat, and confined to
Flinders and Cape Barren. As specimens have been
placed in the Vic. National Park on Wilson’s Promon-
tory it may survive there.

a
“Eddyson” : It happened in the old lion-
shuw '» Ballarat., quite a long- time ago. The main
drive on \o. 3 level was in half a mile, ami the
truckers had a long run for their money, the disfance
not being broken into relays as in most eases. The
latest addition to the “traction engineers” was - a
lumpy little Hibernian named Tom McGuire, four
loot nothing much, almost as tall across, and as
strong as four small horses. Kach Bonshaw
trucker had to have the strength and endurance
°t a Pack-camel,but Pill s shift had beaten the two other
shifts singly in the tug-of-war, and then had walked
oft jHh a team picked from both. The appearance
of “Bantam” McGuire was greeted with derisive and
profane speech. A slow man on the rails was a
block to traffic, and could not he endured. McGuire
had the second helping of trucks. He was given a
couple of journeys to learn the rails, and
pulled through. Then Long Harris got after him to
try his wind. By a superhuman effort Bantam kept
.lust far enough ahead to block Harris’s effort to
“gall his kibe,” and at the end of the shift McGuire
was still a yard or so to the good in a race for the
plat. That night in Curran’s bar the Bantam crew
lustily, and it all ended in a bet of four quid that
McGuire would run a string of five trucks, loaded a
banker with wet wash, from the face to the plat in
two seconds under Long Harris’s celebrated record.
Daniels, the platman, was stakeholder, judge and
starter. His decision was to be final. From the
shaft lie was to give the starting signal, two blows
with a spanner on the air-pipe. McGuire got awav
with a swoop, and the little man made great going
for the first hundred yards or so, invisible behind his
load. Then his chances began to take on a doubtful
aspect. Pic warmed up to rush the incline, and went
sweeping round the stiff curve in fine style. It was
a gallant effort ; but he hadn’t now a ghost of a
chance of' lowering the Harris record. Then came the
miracle. Over a hundred feet of the drive in the
treacherous country came down-with heaven knows
how many thousand tons of creation behind it. What
followed was an amazing demonstration of the power
of compressed air. McGuire with his load, all the men
in the drive, following up the sporting' event with
rabid enthusiasm, the slurry and water on the drive
floor and promiscuous timber and track rails were
'hot along as the bullet is shot along the rifle-barrel.
In the dense darkness that followed the few men
who were privileged ever to hear anything again,
heard a faint voice piping: “Daniels! Daniels. Devil
take ye! Didya shtop ycr watch on me, man?
Bcgor, Ice bust the record !” It was Bantam
McGuire, and Bantam was thinking of his bet. •

A SOCIETY RENDEZVOUS.
EDYTHA: “Seen Isabelle lately?”
MAUDE: “Yes, but one o' the coves on the Bench said 'e reckoned she needed a course o'
bathin so we won't see 'er agin fer three months, allowin’ for the twenty-four
ours I was in wiv ’er!"
“Kerango”: “Ida D.’.s” and “Merrigal’s”
p.'ivs on abo. words and meanings prompted me to
compare the said words with those- of our far north-
ern abos. tV ith them “wallangarra” means death-
adder, and their cure for a bite therefrom is the
juice from a cucumber-like vine applied externally
and taken internally. This remedy produces coma
for about three days, and the patient rarely feels
any ill-effects from the bite. “Eppie” is their only
word for water, whether it be rain, sea, river, creek,
billabong, swamp or pool. “Oongee” means flying-fox,
of which the natives are very fond as food,
whilst its smaller cousin, the bat, is known as
“mun-but-awa.” Carpet-snake is known as “unbow,”
and is a delicacy that the gins and juvenile members
are forbidden to eat lest the curse of “quinken”
v devil-devil) should befall them. “Akooraboo” means
kangaroo, and “unboo” represents wallaby. • “Woga-
noc is the name for emu. “Ecun-ina” means good,
am “ecun-miJliah” very good. “Kai-kai” was the
only word I ever heard them use for tucker; but
this was evidently taken from the Melanesian
dictionary. The far northern tribes’ vocabularies
not very extensive, and the abos. converse with
the aid of numerous gestures. One far northern
Bulletin scribe who lives right on the edge of the
map became quite a proficient linguist and gesticu-
lator within a week or more.

"N.F.”: An extraordinary freak of nature
or vegetable intelligence is to be seen at the elbow
of New South Head-road, past William-street,
Double Bay, Sydney. A bird apparentlvcarried a More-
ton Bay tig-fruit to a big gum-tree on the slope of a
front garden. A seed of the fig took root in a fork
of the gum and threw up two small branchlets. But
the plant found that there was not enough nutriment
in the thin dust flake it rooted in, so it sent a root
down to the ground 2o feet below. The root is as
straight as a gun-barrel, is the diameter of a thin
gas-pipe and looks exactly like one, being perfectly
round and smooth without a knot, twig or blemish.

“Billy T.”: Taylor had sacked Ellis to
put on a lubberly new-chum whose inefficiency was
compensated for by the “reasonable” wages he
demanded and the absence of anything that could
be considered exacting in his needs at meals; more
over, he did not kick when Taylor put him to bunk
in the old burk hut which for years had been given
over to the goats. Ellis met the new hand out in
the paddock on the second day, the latter armed
with axe and saw. He was looking up at a tall
blue-gum in obvious perplexity. “I bin sent to
knock down this tree,” he said, “but dang me if I
know how to begin.” Ellis blew a reflective
whiff. “I think I’d begin at the top with
that one,” he said gravely. “We usually begin
at the top it s sa'fer.” An hour later, when Tavlor
came along to investigate, he found his new man up
the vegetable, sawing off limbs. He was felling the
tree bits at a time. “Come down, you inflamed jack-
ass, yelled the boss. “What in judgment are you
doing up there?” Archie climbed down, and re-
ceived a fair education in the Australian lan-
guage all the way back to dinner. After the meal
he returned to his tree-felling, and Taylor, follow-
ing on in half an hour, found him hard at it with
a pick and shovel, digging round the butt. “I ha’f
suspected yonder feller was pullin’ my leg when he
told me to saw her off,” said the honest workman.
"I reckon it's far better to dig her up.” Ellis is
back in his job and the expert is now floorwalker at
a Lost Dogs’ Home.
‘TIs” : Some of the results of N. S. Wales
Agricultural Department s experiments in grass culti-
'ation on the North Coast hare been made known.
Twelve months ago tufts of Sudan. Elephant, Para!
h bodes and two native grasses were planted at Nam-
lmcea Diver. Elephant and Sudan overshadowed the
others. The former herbage rose to 20ft., and the
latter to Bft. Elephant grass was also given a trial
at Ilu.wkesbury and at Cowra Experiment Farms;
and the fodder is claimed to be the best drought-
-1 esistei with which the State has experimented.

Loo Lear : One of Australia's most re-
markable and interesting forms of life seems to be
in the last stretch before extermination. This is the
eerji tod us, or Burnett salmon, found only in the
Burnett and Alary rivers, Bananaland. As it is the
connecting link between gill-breathing water life and
lung-breathing land-ditto (the eeratodus can do
both), scientists have come from all over the world
to study its habits. Now Dr. T. L. Bancroft, of
Bi isbane, says that its days are numbered. At a
very early stage of life the young eeratodus lies
helpless on the river bottom for hours, and is then
preyed upon and destroyed by the larva; of the com-
mon dragon-fly. So voracious are the latter that for
periods reaching over years no young “salmon”
escape. Then comes a season when a calamity over-
takes the dragon family, and the lung-fish cheat their
destiny for a while and extend the time of their
inevitable end. Ceratodus was once widely distrib-
uted in Australia, for fossils have been found as far
as Cooper’s Creek.

“Barcoo”: The writer who recently de-
clared that the emu produced only from nine to in
eggs in her egg-laying exploits ought to have been
up here with me yesterday when 1 unearthed two
incubators on tire banks of the Barcoo (C.Q.), each
containing 16 of the handsome dark-green eggs.
Unfortunately they were past the edible stage.
Fried when fresh, the eggs are not had; in sweet
or savory omelette, puddings or rich fruit-cake,
they give a delightful flavor. The productivity of
the present season may account for the fowls’
prodigality in the reproduction of the species. Even
the sheep along this stream are exceeding themselves
in that direction this year—twins and triplets,
unusual in the. merino flocks, are quite common.
Saw a batch of seven ewes with twelve newly-born
lambs on this run last week.
* * * *
“Pick” : The brown meat-ants of the N. S.
Wales highlands and Western plains have no sting.
Their business-end is a pair of serrated horny nip-
pch’S; but they display such extreme ferocity that,
with the exception of the spiny anteater, no creature
will withstand their massed assaults. Their tene-
ments are subterranean terraces, honeycombed in
clayey soil. Separate clans are generally sociable,
and well-cleared tracks, three inches wide, are often
hundreds of feet in length between 1 heir strongholds.
Occasionally, though, a feud occurs between tribes,
and then there is war of gruesome intensity. The
fighting hordes chew each other mercilessly, and
the battlefields are strewn with squirming, legless
bodies, which after the fray (friend and foe alike)
are carted off to, the meat-storage chambers of the
victors. The warriors are strategists, too. During
the battle flanking parties and raiders operate
separately from the main army, and foragers loot
the villages of the enemy. After the war for-
saken mounds and disused tracks indicate that a
tribe has either been annihilated or has trekked
beyond the convenient reach of their insatiate con-
querors. The meaties are first-rate bush scavengers,
and there are no go-slow advocates in their carrion-
shifters’ union. Maimed animals or birds, or an
entrapped rabbit or ’possum, have a shuddering time
when the meat-ant arrives.
"Xoogoora'’: The bore which recently
started to spout on Spring-lea station in the Blackall
district (Q.), after four years of sulking, is
claimed to be the deepest in Australia, if not in the
World. A supply of 250,000 gallons a day was struck
at 6000 ft. Some time back it was costing £4 a foot
lor boring and 12s. a foot for casing, so somebody
must be a man of faith and courage. The tempera-
ture of the deep drink is 198 deg.

“Tarwin ’: He caught up to me a couple
of miles from the railway station, and offered me a
ride behind a cantankerous-looking colt that wasn’t
taking too kindly to his first trip in harness. “You
might get there quicker walking,” he remarked as I
climbed aboard. As we crossed the next culvert the
colt suddenly decided to wheel for home, and the
whole caravan capsized. As I crawled clear the
bloke spoke up from under the debris somewhere:
“I was right, mate. You would have got there
quicker walking.”
THE HERMIT BULL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They told me at the station that,
When- gtlg'hi holes were full,
I hole roamed a hermit bull,'
And if 1 spied him on the flat,
I'd "better take a pull.”
A savage brute, upon his plot
Xo trespass he’d allow,
X'or to man's will would bow,
And so disgruntled he would not
Keep comp’uy with a cow.
I trudged away, nor feared the least
Where friendly timber grew,
For thereabouts 1 knew
1 was a winner if the beast
Should seek an interview.
Kre noon the trees were left behind,
A wet plain lay before.
Whereon front shore to shore
A circumspective eye could find
Tall grass, and nothing more.
Beyond, in wild magnificence,
Was many a rugged stack,
Where tangled scrubs looked black;
So 1 advanced with confidence
Along the bridle-track.
But half-way towards the sheltered camps,
"here my day’s stunt would close,
A horny demon rose
And turned two glaring motor lamps
I’pon my blanching nose.
Within ten paces, and with nought
But wet day still' as glue,
And long grass ’tween us two,
We stared amazed as twain who thought,
‘Must fancy meeting you!”
The trees or logs that I might gain
With that brief start of him
Were scarce as seraphim ;
X'or was a hole upon that plain
Where 1 could take a swim.
lie switched his tail and shook his head
In what was, I can say,
A most unfriendly way ;
And he was big—a quadruped
Who filled me with dismay.
I stood transfixed, and tried to think
How I might disappear
Amid the grasses near,
Or make that bovine hermit shrink
Front me in sudden fear.
I focussed him to some extent
With my two quaking eyes,
The brute to mesmerise;
But he moved up as jf lie meant
To toss me to the skies.
I heard the snort of rage Hint scorns
Man's trickery and grit;
Then, as lie charged full split,
1 threw the swag upon his horns
And left him goring it.
Across the plain, with noddle bared,
.lust here and there I set
-V foot ’mid grass and wet—
I was so desperately scared
That i am running yet.

on the sale of the first 2000 copies. Being
a small town the market of course was
glutted, so I stored the balance, but omitted
to insure them, and a fire turned them into
smoke. A post-card camera is quite large
enough—for no more is paid for a halt-
plate view 7 —and films are preferable to
plates on account of lightness. The extra
cost is a mere bagatelle if one is studying
comfort in the summer. As a side-line, m
keeping with his calling, a reporter in any
Australian town should easily add at least
£52 a year to his income, and double that
amount with a little extra time and energy.
From Inez Strachan’s new novel, Her
Australian Letters: —
The men [up-country Australians] presented no
difficulties. They were easily won by bright looks
and a listening attitude. So far, i like them Jess
well than the English public-school man, but with
that one exception 1 prefer them to the men of
any other nationality. They have small feet, are
mostly upright and vigorous, and not at all well
dressed.
Well, although the Outback Australian has
had the advantage of studying so many
English public-school men who were rouse-
abouts of the Shearers’ Arms in between re-
mittance days, the lady couldn’t expect lum
to be right up to specifications.
The Inky Way
“Jacko”: Talking about paper supplies
and costs, let me quote the experience of one
bush rag. Tart of an indent of 15 tons was
cabled from England in March, 1917. The
price was £24 15s. a ton, but with other
charges the cost of the material landed at the
office door worked out at £SO a ton. Before
the war, purchases in this way used to cost
£l2 17s. (Id. to the ton, with freight at £1 15s.
and other charges aggregating £1 a ton. The
bush rag is thinking hard these tunes, and
the pending restriction programme will pro-
bably mean several funerals of the crippled.
“Mustard Gold” : On the Wcstralian Inky
Way two scribes of note are men who
dropped in without travelling the re-
porter's trail. Morrison, whose leaders m
the West Australian, are equal to the best
appearing in Commonwealth dailies, was
knocking about the fields for years tackling
the hardest work among the mines and buck-
ing into bush toil with the axe, until he
found his pen was a better implement.
Andre Hayward, an Oxford 8.A., and ad-
mitted to be the finest writer in the West,
came off an alluvial patch on the Murchison
to do literary work for the Geraldton
Express, from whence he migrated to several
editorial chairs and wrote a book of verse,
“On the Itoad to Cue.”
Trooper Frank Reid, otherwise “Bill Bow-
yang” and “Camcle.ro” of many a Bulletin
par., got back to Sydney last week on his way
to Bananaland. Reid wears the Anzac’s “A,”
and is field-editor of The Kia-Ora Coo-ee, the
successful active-service paper which he had
a big share in founding. The desert Anzacs
had done several volumes of riding and fight-
in? before Harry Gullett was appointed to
record their exploits. Reid is thirsting for
an official chance to bridge the gap. Aus-
tralia ought to preserve a record of the
earlier fighting.
A Satchel of Books
Sundown Stones, by Dorothy Drewett, illustrated
bv Ethel Wood (Tyrrell’s Ltd., Sydney). Fairy-tales
without the knack 'and illustrations without the charm,
aided and abetted by a printer who might have done
better.
That Which Hath Wings, by Richard Dehan
(Heinemann, London). Another novel by the author
of the “Dop Doctor.” The time is January, 1914.
Margot tells her husband it is too painful to have a
baby. That was how some women looked at things
then; but they changed a lot when the Germans
began the slaughter. Well enough written; but the
yarn is spun out too long and it’s too thin.
Jitney and the Boys, by Bennett Copplestone (John
Murray, London). A good yarn of three English boys.
The book pleases and has life in it.
Her Australian Letters, by Inez Strachan (Aus-
tralian Authors’ Agency). To tell a yarn in corres-
pondence and hold the interest is beyond the ability
of the average story-writer. There is a yarn here,
but it takes a lot of patience to get at it. The
people all write their letters very much in the same
style, and it is not a style usual in this day of
telegrams and quick splashing of ink.
A South Sea Saga, told by S. 11. Strong (G. B.
Moon and Go., London). Thousands of dreary and
utterly commonplace lines about the discovery of
Maoriland and its settlement.
Fragments from France, No. s. —This instalment
of Bairnsfather’s humor has been printed in Aus-
tralia for London Bystander from blocks sent out
frQm England. For the Bairnsfather enthusiast
there is Is. 9d. worth of cheer in the 32 pages;
but to the critical Australian Old Bill seems due for
a rest.
Our Birds. —Seven of Neville W. Cayley’s sympa-
thetic color-studies of Australian birds, with accom-
panying letterpress for the instruction of the bush
wanderer, constitute No. 1 of the series published
by the Aldenhoven Art Galleries, Sydney. The
color printing has been well done, and the little
blue wren perched on a golden wattle who looks
through the panel cut in the front cover should
entice the book-buyer searching for a happy re-
minder of Australian wild life to send away or
keep.
Ci'osbie Carstin’s Sunshine Settlers is recommended
as a contribution to this sad world’s mirth. It is
the storv of a bow-legged man in Africa, and the
scene is'laid in that spacious land between the Boer
republics and the Zambesi ; where the British South
Africa Co. hung out its spacious shingle and asked
all and sundry, but especially “gentlemen,” to
come and live as gentlemen should, with abundance
of incompetent niggers to work for them. So the
vounger sons bought large areas of dust cheaply,
and raised' crons of drought, strange bullocks that
were mostly horns, brown sheep, mixed hens, dogs
and white-ants. They didn’t seem to have much
visible means of support, but they got on without it.
Some came in the hope of elephants or war or gold
finds or diamonds. Some just came. It being the
early days of the Hun rush to the land of white-
ants, none of the settlers had grown to be Old Dads.
All were full of the joy of life, except a professional
misanthrope and a married man with one lung. And
the writer makes them very joyous. The work is
full of fine touches—this, for instance, is his descrip-
tion of the Australian bullocky whom he contrasts
favorably with the Kaffir imitation: —
“A professional gentleman, with a vocabulary of
about 700 words, "680 of which are unprintable.
With these and a snake-bellied whip, he educates his
bullocks—heavy, well-bred beasts for the most part
—to do anything except spot counterfeit coin.”
The rest of the volume is quite as good as that.

The Speck’s Lands _ Department has had
successful tests made in the manufacture of
paper from swamp gum and spruce. The
gum is white and much softer than any other
Tasmanian eucalypts, and there is sufficient
in the Florentine Valley alone to supply Aus-
tralia for centuries. The spruce is mixed to
overcome chemical difficulty. A bulk ship-
ment has just been consigned to Boston for
experiment on a commercial scale.

Melbourne suburban councils are trying
to stir the Vic. Government into doing some-
thing to stop the use of green timber in
building new houses, and want to know why
the Newport seasoning kilns aren’t fully sup-
plied. The Forestry Department stipulates
in its timber leases that the kilns are to be
kept fully supplied; but the millers contemp-
tuously ignore the Department, which takes the
medicine lying down. The timber-merchants
back up the millers by taking wood as green
as grass, and are apparently laying themselves
out to kill an Australian industry, with
intent to return to the old importing folly as
soon as ships are available.
* * - * *
There is now a considerable boom in Aus-
tralian-made roofing-tiles, owing to the cessa-
tion of imports. Around Melbourne every
little while a new manufactory springs up,
encouraged by the fact that building in the
suburbs is going ahead at the rate of 10 new
houses every day. The owners are doing
well at the business and are able to pay good
wages. A returned-soldiers’ outfit is now
making tiles of concrete and selling them fast
at a rate which allows a decent margin.
The concrete tile, though it has _ no reinforce-
ment, is almost as solid as granite when pro-
perly aged, and compares quite favorably m
appearance and texture with the rather
brittle clay product, besides looking very well
with any colored house-paint. Handsome
combinations are possible, such as one with
dark green-stained gable-shingles and window-
frames. #
Concerning our cannibal brother :
War’s price-raising- lever has not missed the
Kanaka on his cocoanut-clad isles in the Equatorial
Pacific. He now finds that he gets only three or four
sticks of tobacco for his Is. in place of six or seven
in pre-war days. Most other trade goods have also
gone skywards in price, notably cheap prints, 2yds.
of which constitute a new spring suit (“lava-lava ).
An indentured laborer who has completed his teim
of three years on a plantation 4ix>w receives for his toil
considerably less than half (in trade goods) of what
he got before the war pinch. This has greatly mili-
tated against recruiting of late, as it is hard for
the Kanaka to understand the sudden and enormous
rise in prices—perhaps some profiteering importer
could explain. The planter and trader are a good
deal to blame, because they pass on the extra cost
together with a little more for good luck. Certainly
the white man must pay more for his trade goods,
mostly of Japanese manufacture now, but he gets consid-
erably higher returns for his copra, shell and other
products, while the laborer’s wages remain as before,
ss. or 6s. per month. Labor regulations provide for
a ration to each laborer of tobacco, pipe and other
perquisites in addition to the monthly wage; but
stocks of clay pipes, formerly coming from Austria,
are now exhausted, and, Australia being unable
to manufacture such complex articles, the boys are
mostly issued paper to roll cigarettes. I know of
at least one large Hamburg-owned firm that monthly
imports hundreds of copies of Sydney’s most jingo-
istic Hun-strafing daily (Saturday’s issue) to pro-
vide paper for its 1200 laborers. I also lately saw
a boy paid off whose box of trade contained six rolls
of sanitary-paper for this purpose. He regarded it
as cigarette paper. de luxe.
* * * *
Some time ago, Quirk’s, the Sydney light-
ing and engineering firm which has installed
over 0000 air-gas plants throughout the Com-
monwealth, was threatened with a shortage
of the specially-made chains which were
used in connection with the driving-gear ot
their lighting apparatus. However, the co.
was not to be beaten, so all hands at the
factory at Alexandria were set at work to
devise a substitute. The result was the
invention of a new and entirely novel mul-
tiple-drive plate which is more than a substi-
tute, for it ensures a steady pressure (“as
steady as the sunlight,” it is claimed)
which the experts have been striving for ever
since self-contained lighting systems were
introduced. Further, the invention has
reduced the mechanism of lighting-machines
to a simplicity which a child can operate
with absolute safety.
THE FLIGHT OF CAPITAL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Questioned by Mr. Higgs in the House of Repre-
sentatives as to the drift of Australian capital to
foreign countries, the Treasurer stated that the
finance council had this matter under consideration.”
—Daily paper.
For years it fled. No wind of politics
Could blow, but someone gazing would descry
Our capital and all its bag of tricks
Leaving the land that new reform made dry.
It fled from tariffs and from Labor laws,
It fled when Ins went out or Outs came in ;
Each party in its turn was held the cause;
Each leader suffered for the dreadful sin.
So sleek a thing was Capital to hold,
An ornament to cheer our nights and days,
Its silver trappings and its chains of gold
Seemed always worthy of unstinted praise.
Men said it caused the wheels of trade to turn
And kept the wolf from yowling at the door;
What wonder that all hearts began to burn
To see it seek another, kinder shore?
From year to year it fled, and day by day •
The sorrow grew in Parliament and press ;
Yet, somehow, though it always went away,
It still kept living at the same address.
When it was timorous and most dismayed
It proved as solid as the steadfast rocks ;
The more it went, in fact, the more it stayed,
And no one worried out the paradox.
It is the sportive creature’s curious way.
Drown it or burn it, it is all the same.
To-morrow it can eat up yesterday,
And wears a frill of war-bonds round its name.
Yet some have fears that it may fly again.
What need to fear? Let no salt tears be shed.
When it is gone statistics will explain
That it is merely lying snug in bed.

THE PLANT IS SIMPLE, EFFICIENT and DURABLE.
ELC0-L1GHT consists of an engine, generator,
switchboard and set of batteries. The engine
and generator are direct connected, which does
away with any transmission losses or belt trouble, in-
creasing the efficiency of the machine. The storage
battery is of the special Delco-Light type, consisting of
sixteen glass jar cells, delivering 32-volt current. Unless
the demand for light and power is very heavy, it is un-
necessary to run the engine, except when the storage
battery requires recharging.
Electricity is stored up in the battery by means of
the generating unit. Wires lead from the light and power
connections to this storage battery, from which electric
current is used as desired for light or power.
You will find Delco-Light to be a model of simplicity.
When it becomes necessary to re-charge the battery the
engine is started by merely pressing in on the starting-
switch located on the switchboard. This electrically
cranks the engine, just as the automobile engine is
cranked by an electric self-starter. The engine starts
running on its own power in a few seconds. It can then
be left to itself, as when the battery is completely charged
the Delco-Light engine stops automatically.
The supply of kerosene is regulated by means of
a simple lever-operated mixing valve. Moving the lever
to the right or left regulates the supply of fuel.
There is only one place to put oil. The crank case
is designed to hold about three quarts of oil, and a rapidly
revolving gear carries a fine spray to all parts requiring
lubrication.
The reliability of Delco-Light has been proved through
actual service under trying conditions. It has been
thoroughly tested in every possible way, both in the shop
and in practical service on the farm and in the home.
Nothing has been left to chance. The tests have been
more severe than any service an owner would require.
For example, the machine -has been run under
a full load for seventy days and seventy nights
continuously. It was then carefully examined and found
to show almost no wear and to be in excellent
working condition.

The foolishness of double-banking State
and Federal jobs was recently illustrated on
a small scale in Adelaide. The “Cleopatra”
film, exhibited in Sydney with the approval
of both Federal and N. S. Wales censors,
was due at Adelaide Royal on a Saturday.
It arrived that morning, but the State Cen-
sorship Board informed the manager that,
firstly, the film could not be shown publicly
till they had seen it; and, secondly, that
a.m. was not convenient for them to
have a private view. So a different pro-
gramme to that advertised had to be put up
at short notice. The film was graciously
passed on the Monday.
“Jeelhdi” : Apart from his hauling strength
the elephant, as a transport animal, makes
the best Clydesdale look as helpless as a
gazelle. At Benalla (Vic.) recently, Jumbo.
Wirth Bros.’ big bull elephant, was pulling
a seven-ton load along as if he was harnessed
to a go-cart. Turning in at the circus lot, lie
got the hind wheels of the waggon bogged in
a rut. The driver, unhooking the chains,
led Jumbo around to the rear of the waggon,
pointed to the axle, and said: “Hullah!”
Whereupon Jumbo hooked his trunk around
the axle, lifted the wheels and slewed them
on to the firm ground at the side. I wonder
how many elephants would be required to put
the N. S. Wales public debt on firm ground.
“Ancient Prompter” : Seems as though the
long-promised reappearance of the genial
and faultlessly-tailored Frederick Niblo on
Australian boards will, after all, not eventu-
ate. The Firm has engaged Max Figman,
another ’Murkan light-comedy merchant, for
the Niblo parts in the new series of farces
soon to done here. Figman is the origi-
nal of the title-role in “The Man on the
Box,” a cheery little piece played in Aus-
tralia by Hugh Buckler and his company.
Niblo and his wife (Enid Bennett, of W.A.)
are starring in the “pictures” in the U S.A.
just at present, and the job, presumably, is
too good to leave.
“Diaphragm”: For mixed picture audi-
ences tell “Burrundie” (B. 3/10/T8) to try
Broome (W.A.). He can bring his Darwin
list, and I’ll add to it. Fastidious Broomers
usually walk to the show to avoid physical
contact with the Malays, Koepangers and
Manilamen—who crowd the cars and pay
2s. for about five minutes’ ride. Poor old
“Gib it tchillun, boss,” also pads the hoof to
see Chaplin, as he or she generally smells too
high for the other passengers.
“II.”: Ethel Irving has got a role that
suits her right down to the footlights in “The
Chinese Puzzle,” produced with pronounced
success at the New, London. The piece is a
sort of up-to-date version' of “Diplomacy,”
the Sardou drama that made a big hit in the
’seventies, and in which Eleanor Carey scored
triumphs in Melbourne and Sydney. In the
plot Ethel Irving is the wife of a young
diplomatist. Her mother has a shady past,
and she instigates her daughter to photo-
graph the text of a secret agreement concern-
ing a Chinese Navy Loan. Ethel obeys, and
her parent sells the information to a press
agency. Of course, there is a German spy
mixed up in it as a partner of the disrepu-
table mother. Ethel’s deceived husband is
duly suspected and forced to resign, where-
upon harrowing complications ensue, and
Ethel piles on the agony artistically. The
critics are throwing admiring fits.
“Stage Wait”: Concerning “The Two
Orphans” “Melb.” (B. 10/10/T8) is far at
sea. In the New York production at the
New Amsterdam Theatre Kyrle Bellow
played the Chevalier, Edward O’Neil was
Pierre and Chas. Warner was Jacques, an
all-star combination done by the Siebler Co.
In Australia George Rignold never played
Pierre. Dion Boucicault, and afterwards A.
R. Lawrence, played the cripple to Rignold's
Jacques. Subsequently, when William Ris-
nold did Jacques, Arthur Greenaway was
Pierre, and 11. R. Jewett Chevalier de Van-
dray.
“Omar”: The Australian movie-maker has
still a few things to learn. In a feature
film now showing, some returning explorers
are supposed to be watching a native dance
somewhere near the centre of Australia. Yet,
when I looked over their shoulders, there in
plain view was a suburban weatherboard
house! I went out then and invited the
manager to have a 3d. pie at the Australia
Club.
“First Old Man”: “Eyes of Youth,” the
new Emilie Polini vehicle, which is not un-
likely to run a good while at its present
Sydney address, was recently staged at the
St. James’s, the late George Alexander’s
playhouse, London. The heroine was there
played by the wife of actor-knight Forbes
Robertson. Australia had a fleeting glance
of this mumineress a good few years ago,
when, as Gertrude Elliott, she appeared with
the Nat Goodwin comedy company. Her
sister, the beauteous Maxine, was also of
the “crowd” playing “lead” —on and off the
stage. She was Mrs. Nat.
HIS VIEWPOINT.
THEATRICAL MANAGER: “What did you think
of our new revue?”
FRIEND: “Oh, fine! The girls were to
natural —nothing put on, you know.”
“Private Boxer”: The Tait firm promise
us a production of Pshaw’s “Doctor’s Dilem-
ma” to inaugurate their Repertory season in
Sydney. The flashy, patchy “tragedy” (its
author’s own label) should certainly be
worth hearing. Sydney has already sampled
several of G.B.S.’s masterpieces, but, I imag-
ine, the time was not yet ripe, from a box-
office.aspect, for any of them. Julius Knight,
under J C.W. auspices, staged “Arms and
the Man,” and “Man and Superman,” but
Julius Marcus Superbus and Knight the
Shavian are two very different propositions
commercially speaking—and otherwise. A
bit nearer the bull’s-eye was Buckler’s pre-
sentation of “Fanny’s First Play,” at the
Little (now the Playhouse) a few years
ago. “The Devil’s Disciple” is also, no
doubt, kindly remembered by the few who
saw it. With a better cast it might stand a
chance in the regular bill. Shaw, X think,
wants a specially selected, or unusual, mob
of mummers for his proper interpretation,
and in the Tait’s production he appears
likely to get it.
Latest rumors ancnt Hugh Buckler, who
is appearing in “By Pigeon Post” at the
London Garrick, are to the effect that pre-
vious rumors anent the loss of sundry limbs
were grossly exaggerated. A wound in the
breast was the extent of his injuries.
Poverty Pointers’ old friend Reg Wyke-
ham drops a cheerful greeting- from the
Front. He reports that he isn’t sick,
wounded nor even killed.
Melbourne is again to have two panto-
mimes at Christmas. The Firm is doing
“Goody Two Shoes,” while the Taits and
Bert Bailey will offer “Jack and Jill,” with
Lupino as Dame, and Bailey and Marie
King-Scott (one of the quaintest of recent
Tivoli performers) as associate mirth-
makers.
“Et ” : Has Lord Byron’s weird and won-
derful, morbid and mystical drama "Man-
fred” ever been staged in Australia? A
couple of performances in Drury Lane, Lon-
don, by the combined strength of the Incor-
porated Stage Society and Beecham’s Opera
Co. have produced upwards of £2OOO for a
war charity. At its first production at
Covent Garden in 1804 the chief success was
scored by a young actress named Ellen Tree
as “The Witch of the A lps.” Thirty years later,
as Mrs. Charles Kean, she toured Australia
with her husband. The incidental music on
ihat occasion was composed and conducted
by Henry Bishop, the husband of the
Madame Aura Bishop who is well remem-
bered by old Melbourne and Sydney play-
goers. “Manfred” had its one long and
successful run under the management of
Samuel Phelps, in whose brilliant London
Shakspearean Co. a couple of future Aus-
tralian favorites, William Hoskins and Mrs.
G. B. W. Lewis, served their early appren-
ticeship.
The exact meaning of the word “matinee”
has been under discussion in the English
Chancery Court. Vaudevillain Billy Merson
appealed for relief from his contract with
the Theatre of Varieties (Ltd.), which bound
him to appear at their music-halls twice
nightly and at two matinees a week, also at
any matinees the co. might direct in addition.
The contract still has several years to run,
and the co. is making him appear at the Pal-
ladium every afternoon —a steady three-
shows-a-day house. The option given to the
management being so wide, Merson was re-
duced to arguing that, by the custom of the
profession, a matinee means a sort of extra
show, not a regular one. George Robey, who
gave evidence in support, was led on, by
clever cross-examination, to allow that
matinees might be increased to five per week,
and still be matinees, but if there are six
they became a different thing. On which
the Judge told Merson that the word is plain
French for any afternoon performance, and
that seemed to settle it. All the same,
it looks as if he got more law than
equity; the fact that the contract mentioned
two matinees as an average allowance sug-
gests strongly that a show every afternoon
was not contemplated by either side. Still,
as it was stated in court that his salary is
about equal to that of the Chancery Judge
who heard the case, and that his turn at
each show lasts only about 20 minutes, the
“strain” he complained of is one that most
people would be ready to bear, if the worst
came to the worst.
“S.S.” : He sat next to me at a suburban
picture-show on a recent Saturday night.
He was perhaps 58, flabby-faced, the color
of yesterday’s dough, shabby, ill-booted, and
giving an impression that he was saving up
his daily baths for one grand splash. At a
glance you would have sworn his name was
Herr Wilhelm Bismarck Hindenburg. A
“Gazette” was showing, the drifting item
being a contribution from the front.
“Who doze vitch runnink iss?” asked my
neighbor, who, I gathered could not read
English. “They are German prisoners
coming in,” said I. “Und goot enough for
dem fellers. Eet vos a pity iss it dey don’d
ged id vorse knecker don diss.” A few
shell-bursts implied an unpleasant disturb-
ance in the thick of Fritz. “Dot our poys;
dey giff ’em hell —vot? Goot enough for doze
Sherman’s, und vorse too. I tink me eet
vos better de.v all die mit der shock-shell.”
I stood a good deal of this before saying:
“And what part of Scotland do you come
from, Herr?” He looked surprised and hurt.
“Scodlant?” he said. “Vot make it you
t’ought dot I vos a Scottish? Nein; mine
families eet vos Iritch to der bonebaek.”
Music-hall competition proving too strong,
the old Surrey Theatre, in Blackfriars-
road has given up the ghost. Charles
Ihbdin, the nautical song-writer and song-
ster, built the playhouse in 1742. It was
then the Royal Circus. George 111. was a
frequent visitor, and when the orchestra
played that “Britons never, never, never,”
etc., he was won’t to thump his stick on the
floor and exclaim: “No, by God, and as long
as I live they never shall be.” Buckstone
scored his first success at the Surrey, and
Douglas Jerrold’s “Black-Eyed Susan” was
produced there and ran 400 nights. Jerrold
had been writing plays at a fixed screw of
£5 a week for a rival house.
“Chasuble”: Rev. T. Horne, “the Show T-
men’s Chaplain,” died in England a few
weeks ago. His father was a zoologist and
lecturer in a travelling menagerie. The
future parson was born in a caravan, held
curacies and became a rector, but gave most
of his time to show-people, of whom there
are 75,000. Horne knew them all, and
travelled extensively, often as much as
6000 miles in a season. He was secretary
and organiser of the Showmen’s Guild, and
a valuable friend to his wanderers.
With the expulsion of the Turk from
Palestine the lights go up in the theatres —
one in Jerusalem and another in Joppa. The
plays at these stands are given in Hebrew,
and are of the same class, though not in
quite the same language, as the Yiddish
drama, so popular in New York. “The
Merchant of Venice” was acted in Jerusalem
before the war, Irving’s chivalrous Sliyloek
affording a model that drew unqualified and
natural sympathy.
From London :
An English theatrical manager, appealing to the
military tribunal for exemption of his leading-man
until Christmas, said that “he had advertised for a
villain for six weeks and was unable to get one.”
“ KATINKA ,” AT SYDNEY MAJESTY'S.
Arif Bey, keeper of the harem (Olive
Peacock , and Abdul (Claude Bantock).
He furthermore stated that in the play he was about
to product he had to cut down the east from 44 to
TO characters owing to the scarcity of suitable
actors. This statement doesn’t harmonise with the
advertising pages of the London theatrical weeklies,
which contain the names of a number of notable
actors “resting” or “disengaged.” Anyhow this is
not the time for putting on plays with 44 characters
in them.
A meeting of those interested in the pre-
sentation of literary and intellectual plays
will be held at the Palace Theatre to-morrow
(Friday) afternoon, at half-past four. Jus-
tice Heydon will preside, and the speakers
will include W. A. Holman, T. R. Bavin and
John Lane Mullins.
THE PRICELESS GIFT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Cabbages are a fabulous price in Melbourne to-
day.”—The Age.
The fairy floats upon her toes,
With ivory arms extended ;
The gossamer behind her flows,
And mad the bald spectator grows.
’Tis grace and music blended.
The whole house rocks, applauding Zo ;
The bald spectator cries “Bravo!”
The music dies way. She bends
In pagan-like devotion ;
The lime a mystic color lends,
And accurate the old boy sends
His bouquet into motion.
A cabbage ’tis, and, smiling now,
Zo thanks the rich man with a bow.

This CO. is ilie Australasian agent of the
Automatic Electric Co. of Chicago, and is
installing automatic telephones under con-
tiact to the Commonwealth and Maoriland
Governments. It has some nice contracts in
hand; but its big difficulty at: present is
obtaining material from the U.S.A. How-
ever, equipment is on hand or in transit to
complete the big “City North” exchange in
Sydney, and the Malvern (Vic.), Christ-
church and Wanganui (M.L.) exchanges.
Paid capital is £02,500, and the financing of
the big contracts it has on hand (which
necessitate heavy initial payments) have put
a strain on the co.:—
1916. 1917. 1918.
Sundry creditors.. .. £1,216 £1,320 £13,417
Overdraft.. .. .. 43,310
Stock, plant and sundry
debtors .. .. 5,910 5,038 16,775
Cash, etc. .. .. 49,351 52,698 105,575
The cash, etc., includes work in progress,
£71.829, valued at cost, and deposits on un-
finished contracts, £3OlO. The increase in
the sundry debtors item is due largely to an
amount owing by the Maoriland Government,
which may be regarded as being as good as
cash. But the co. has had to lean heavily on
the bank, and payment of half the 10 p.c. div.
will not. be made until February next. There
is still some very profitable work ahead,
but owing to the need for Government
economy the extension of the automatic
telephone system is not likely to be so rapid
as was originally intended. So during the
year no new contracts have been secured Of
course the time will come when there will be
practically no new exchanges to instal and
this co. will have little work to do. But
seeing it is little more than an agent, capi-
tal should be intact when that time comes.
Even now plant stands in the hooks at a very
small amount. On the other hand, £12,500 of
the paid capital of £02,500 represents good-
will, and that item can be reduced only by
holding on to some of the profits.
The Surface Hill mine, at Wattle Flat, on
the old Turon field (N.S.W.) is another of
the early-day propositions that are being
resurrected. The show was last worked in
earnest 40 years ago. Twelve months back a
Sydney party, since formed into a co. with
a capital of £6OOO, acquired the show. The
old workings were broken into and rich stone
located. Nearly four tons of ore were taken
from four leaders, this being put through
the Little Oakey five-head stamp battery,
and producing 14 ounces of retorted gold.
The co. is satisfied with the prospects and
is now proceeding to enlarge itself.
The almost complete cessation of work at
the Abercrombie co.’s works at Burraga
(N.S.W.) reflects the position in the copper
market. All the furnaces have been cold
for weeks. Meantime the big body of matte
on the floors is being despatched to Lithgow.
Tlie stuff averages about 75 p.c., being the
cream of the furnaces’ contents handled
during the past few years. Just when the
show will pull down the shutters completely
again can’t be predicted. The state of affairs
is discouraging after the expenditure of
£14,000 by the new co. early last year in
improvements and development work. One
of the biggest factors in the concern has been
fuel supply. The cost of coal being too high,
the co. used wood for the furnaces, drag-
ging supplies eight miles by tramway. A
hundred men are employed ordinarily on this
side of the business alone. Last year 4000 tons
of slag and 1000 tons of ore dump were con-
centrated and smelted to blister, and carried
to the co.’s Lithgow works. In addition over
8000 tons of ore were raised and treated.
The gross value of the ore dealt with by the
co. during the year was £41,700.
* * * *
The Illawarra district (N.S.W.) is the
principal coke manufacturing centre in the
Commonwealth, producing about 300,000
tons valued at £375,000 per annum. When
the industry first began to expand 20 years
ago, there was an abundance of small coal
or “slack” available to feed the coke-ovens.
In fact the accumulation of slack made in
working the coal had been a bother to col
liery managers, who had it tipped on the
mountain side, where it became ignited and
formed the familiar slack-heap fires of a
quarter of a century ago. To-day it is the
other way about. So keen is the demand
for coke owing to the expansion of the smelt-
ing and refining industries, that there is not
enough slack now made in the ordinary
course of working to satisfy the ravenous
appetite of the 600 coke-ovens in the district.
To meet the shortage some of the works have
installed crushing plants to break up large
coal into small. Like all commodities war
conditions have helped to hit up the cost of
coke. Prior to 1914 it was 14s. per ton on
trucks at sidings; to-day it is about 255.
The principal markets are Mt. Morgan, Mt.
Lyell, Port Pirie and Port Iverabla, New-
castle and Lithgow.

Silver Spur (Q.) is sending matte rich in
silver to the Sulphide Corporation, at Cockle
Creek (N.S.W.), where it is treated by
a special process. Smelting was started by
the present co. last February, and a new
method was adopted of adding blister cop-
per to the furnace charge to act as a collec-
tor of the silver. During August the fur-
nace treated 225 tons of ore for matte con-
taining 35000 z. silver, and base metal worth
£9OO. At 200 ft. a winze is being sunk
on ore of average quality, and the stopes
from 400 ft. upwards are said to carry pay-
able values. To a large extent the future
depends on the ransacking of an old mine
that has been closed down for years.

The Lighl
■ai 01 aaa
Australia
Evolving with
the Times.
A new and entirely novel multiple
drive-plate has just been patented by
Quirks Lighting and Engineering,
Ltd.
Clockwork Precision.
This device supersedes the old chain
system of drive connecting the rotary
axle of the winding drum, blower
spindle and petrol shaft. Experts claim
that for a lighting system Avhere abso-
lute clockwork precision is essential,
this invention is one of the most unique
and effective yet devised. It reduces
the mechanism of the machine down to
simplicity itself —and simplicity and
effectiveness are the chief recommenda-
tion in machinery where steadiness is a
sine qua, non to the maximum of suc-
cess.
New Drive Discovery.
I he steady pressure of the weight oper-
ating in conjunction with the new drive
patent is what all lighting experts have
been striving for during the past half-
century, but not until now have the
world’s brains been able to evolve such
a subtle invention, which ensures the
steadiest light yet produced by any self-
contained system.
Steady as the Sunlight
No combustion, no distressing of
engines, no attendant vibration or other
disabilities, but a silent, constant and
steady pressure, producing for the
country or suburban home brighter and
better light than anything the public
has yet seen, free from the worries of
complicated mechanism and as steady
as the sunlight itself.
Safety of Your Home.
A child can understand the new model
Quirk plant, and the parents may be
assuied that no matter what may be
done, save smashing the machine up,
not the least harm will befall anyone
associated with it.

CAMOUFLAGE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A good man died ere broke the morn,
A good, tall man who kept the law.
He held youth’s weaknesses in scorn,
And all the wickedness he saw
He did deplore in phrases glib.
It was to him a sad mistake
That Adam, for his children’s sake,
Was not advised to keep his rib.
The good man’s soul went proudly out,
And up where shone the morning star.
He felt no quake, no sort of doubt,
And saw the round, red sun afar,
A little thing. Upon the stair
Of beaten gold his feet were set.
No other drifting soul he met;
He was the one saint climbing there.
He came to an effulgent gate
As white as glory and aglow
With preciousness. A thing elate
Sat over, and a dimpled row
Of haloed cherubim did swell
Their cheeks a brazen hymn to pour.
The Devil opened wide the door,
And, grinning, welcomed him to Hell!
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.
“Gouger’s” novelette:—
I was with a party of Light Horse scouts who
were reconnoitring near an Assyrian village, when
from a clump of rocks came a rifle-shot that killed
one of our horses. Now the owner of that horse
would rather have been shot himself than see his
beloved prad killed by a lurking sniper. So with
a furious oath he picked himself from the ground
and ran straight for the rocks. The rest of us
put spurs to our horses and also made for them. The
Turkish sniper jumped up and ran, as only a man
with death at his heels can run, straight for an
Assyrian village. He dashed through the open door-
way of a large hut, the door of which we found
veiy strong and heavily barred. Some minutes were
spent in breaking it open, and we were in a room,
empty but with another closed door at the end.
This was also broken open, and in the darkest
corner of the room was the sniper. There
was also a woman, but she covered up her face
and, screaming, ran out as we rushed in. The
corporal in charge had his work cut out to stop
our infuriated comrade from shoving his bayonet
there and then through the prisoner. Out in the sun-
light the horseless man said: “It’s no good, Corporal,
I mean to have that man’s life. My old horse has
carried me these last two years through thick and
thin. He was killed by a cowardly shot. It’s six
miles back to Headquarters. It is impossible for
you to prevent me shooting him on the way. Far
better to get the job finished now.” The corporal
undecided for a minute. Then he angrily
said: “Oh, all right; have it your own damned way.”
Rough hands pushed the Turk against the wall, the
man whose horse was shot stepped forward, and
with hard eyes lifted the rifle to his shoulder. The
sniper suddenly screamed, clutched off the military
cap on his head, and pulled down a fall of jet
black hair. “He” was a young Assyrian woman. She
Lad swapped clothes with the hunted man in the few
minutes it had taken us to reach him. The “woman”
who had slipped away was the sniper. We never got
him.
ihe N. S. ~S\ ales Railway Department is
wasting good law expenses in protesting
against Judge Rolin's award of increased
wages (10s. Bd. per day minimum) and re-
duced hours (44 per week instead of 48) to
railway maintenance and construction men.
it is always wiser to pay without remon-
strance, and promptly put up passenger
iates to cover the difference. Protest means
paying fees to several barristers. Acquies-
cence means collecting more money from
practically all barristers, for the legal fra-
ternity lives in the remote suburbs and is an
easy mark. Also, protest is doubtful, while
acquiescence is a dead certainty.
About a dozen North Coast towns claim
to be the place where Reid, when N. S.
Wales Premier in the ’nineties, flippantly told
the farmers to “grow cows,” when asked
what they should do after he had removed
the Protective duty from the sugar industry.
As a matter of fact, he repeated the quip
at several places during a tour of the dis-
trict. Lhe stout politician was actually given
xt , c , re J“ lt ln some quarters of having started
North Coast dairying on its way to prosperity
by working off this gag. But the industry
had been already well established in the Big
pcrub, though farmers on .the cane-grow-
mg flats fought shy of it because of the
liability of these areas to floods, which
would be ruinous to dairying, while only
ii ligating the cane. Canegrowing still
flourishes on suitable areas of the Clarence,
Richmond and Tweed, where it supports
twice the population that dairying would.
“Ybned”: I know something about the
tiade to be done with Java, Sumatra and
Malay States. The majority of the manu-
facturers here also know the possibilities.
Now is the time to send a couple of Aus-
tralian salesmen (subsidised by the Govern-
to amount of, say, £5OO a year,
which would pay living expenses there), one
to work Java and Sumatra, the other to
work Straits Settlements and Malay States,
to sell the principal products of the Com-
monwealth and. collect trade statistics.
There are over 30 million natives in Dutch
Bast Indies and they are learning to eat bis-
cuits, jams, preserves, hams, cheese, etc. They
are also learning to wear boots, straw hats
and clothes, all under the able tuition of the
Japanese. America does a certain amount
ot the trade, but Japan is getting in. because
the Japanese Government helps the mer-
chant, and because the Japs have plenty
of ships. Freight at the present time is
V™ Ibjesome 1 bjesome from Australia to the Near East.
What is going to be more troublesome is the
tact that some Australian manufacturers
hawe not sent goods up to sample. That’s
rotten business when opening up new mar-
“ Bill Bowyang”: The schools that teach
drawing by post have reaped a harvest since
the war began. I’ve met scores of men in
tlie hring-lme who are receiving these lessons
trom London, but not one of them to my
knowledge has yet turned out anything worth
publishing. In a dugout in the Jordan Valley

A COUGH SYRUP CHILDREN LIKE.
A pint of really effective cough syrup
which children all like because it is so
pleasant to take, and which combines the
healing and remedial properties of Norway
pine, pine tar and wild-cherry bark, can.be
made at home for a few pence by dissolving
half a pound of granulated sugar in half a
pint of hot water and adding 2oz. of titrate
of tar. Stir thoroughly, pour into a pint-bottle,
and when cool it is ready for use. For chil-
dren I find from half a teaspoonful to a tea-
spoonful every hour or two will conquer
an obstinate cough in a short time and give
relief from that tickling irritation with the
first dose. Adults should take one teaspoon-
ful every two or three hours according to
severity of cough.— Advt.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
for
SMART
MILLINER
Sydney, October 14, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
The Society of Artists opened the annual
show with a sub-regal flourish. Before his
Ex. made a few remarks after cautiously in-
specting the exhibits, John Lane Mullens
addressed the company. Where the crowd
would have been put if the show had been
in the Society’s own rooms goodness knows.
As it was, the big galleries in the Education,
palace surged with first-day visitors. In
the throng and looking over the tops of its
hats w r as tall Prof. Wilkinson, of the new
Chair of Architecture. He dropped in just
in time to hear Governor Davidson discourse
on the relation between art and architec-
ture. President Julian Ashton wasn’t well
enough to be present at the opening of his
own Society’s show, which is one of the best
this city has seen for years.
One of Tassy’s distinguished soldiers, who
has friends in this settlement, Major Giblin,
D. 5.0., M.C., of Hobart, was wed in Eng-
land the other day to Eileen Burton, of East
Molesey.
Lord Tennyson, ex-Governor-General of
the Commonwealth, was quietly married
again a few weeks ago. He chose a widow,
Mrs. Hichens, of Guildford (Eng.).
The last race-day—for a few weeks—at
Ilandwick was introduced with enough wind
to toss impudently the light muslin dress of
the Summer Girl, who was triumphant,
nevertheless, on the lawn. ■ Clad either
in blue, softly azure like the sky _of
her native land, with gold-tinted trim-
mings or shades that vied in charm with
the delicate pink of peach-blossom, or the
snowdrift of white apple-blossoms, she was
a vision of summer to be.
A few eccentricities were accidents to the
picture—a hat on which apparently sprouted
a young turnip-top, a baby cauliflower, a
futurist posy like a group of young pump-
kins tacked on to a billowing flyaway cos-
tume. One toque Avith a pointed spiral blue
feather, others with aeroplane formations
that flapped wings impatient for flight, gave
a festive note to the A.J.C. dress parade.
Mrs. A. E. Hughes, one of the charmers in
the official stand, Avas frocked in soft cream
and pale pink. Mrs. Tom .Rolin, in the vivid
shade of the green of young grass, Avas
goAvned in a typical summer dress. Mrs.
Rutter’s ash of roses tailor-made and Mrs.
Gregory’s dove-grey plumage Avere paraded
together. The DoAvner dame (artist Una
Russell before she married the late Adelaide
knight) Avore a delicate mauve goAvn the
color of an orchid. On the lawn Mrs. Jim
Gordon, of Manar, was with a pretty sister.
The Nivisons, of Ohio, were in town for
the festivities. The squatting MeMasters,
Mrs. Neil Macdonald and a host of Avoolly
patrons were crushed into the big rod stand
near the saddling-paddock.
The Imperial Service Club is godpa to the
dance in Paddington Town Hall on October
IS. It’s to be a dressy affair (tickets 7s. 6d.)
for Jack’s Day. Mrs. Stephen Lambton is
one of the promoters.
The Teachers’ Training Collegians had an
afternoon out in the great hall of Sydney
University the other day. Amongst the
sclxool-marms on the platform Avho fluttered
mere ordinary hats of the season Avere several
avlio Avore the trying millinery familiarly
known as trencher-boards, and shook out
floppy ’Varsity goAvns as they bustled into
stout leather chairs. Education Minister
James, after giving an appreciative resume
of his oavu good Avorks, had to hurry <?ff to a
Cabinet meeting. Then the learned Scot,
Prof. Mackie, a thin, ascetic figure in cap
and goAvn, as head of the Dominies’ Training-
College, gave a gentle smack at misguided
persons Avho prefer good accommodation (with
a Avater frontage) for Avild animals or a rail-
Avay to a racecourse to hostels and spacious
class-rooms for students. Governor David-
son, later on. handed the prizes to the right-
ful owners and addressed the crowded assem-
bly in a speech that flicked the dust off Aris-
totle and Plato, and finished with a polish
to the gallant part the Australians had
played in the great war. Then came the sur-
prise of the very blue academic afternoon.
Dressed in white muslin, a lovely young
thing Avalked quietly up to the marble steps
of the dais. Pausing to boAV to his Ex. and
with a calm self-possession that thrilled the
youngsters in the hall, Miss Perkins, star
student of the Training College, returned
thanks to the sub-regal personage, and in
ringing tones briefly addressed the meeting.
Beauty and brains in a summery white frock
brought down the house. Boys and girls
gave the heroine a ’tumultuous greeting.
Captain Leslie (“Barney”) Allen, M.C.,
recently home amongst the gum-leaves after
three years at the Front, has put a diamond
circlet on the finger of Dorothy, a daughter
of the R. C. McAdams, of Aberdeen
(N.S.W.). The lass is not long home. She’s
been doing canteen work at the War Chest
Club in Blighty.
There’s a private-view day on this Thurs-
day at Canberra House, Elizabeth-street. Our
Best People having behaved handsomely in
the matter of giving a unique collection —a
rare vase or so, ivory curios, a few antiques
—want to see the goods before they go to the
sale for Jack’s Day. Also, there’s a natural
curiosity to see the size and shapes of their
friends’ sacrifice to the cause.
A peep at pretty Alice Purser’s wedding
frock (the Wahroonga girl married Donald
Nettleton, of the same leafy suburb this mid-
week) gave one a roseate vision of exquisite
pale-pink finery. The top film of delicate
drapery was georgette trimmed with silver
lace. Silver tissue (which runs georgette close
on these occasions) and tulle and a foam of
corsage draping embroidered with tiny silver
beads completed the poem. A wreath of pink
heather and a tight little Elizabethan bou-
quet veiled in silver gossamer were acces-
sories. There was a doubt early in the week
as to whether Dr. Cecil Purser would be
well enough to give his only girl away, as the
influenza fiend had him in its fell grip. Bride
and ’groom took the vows standing under
two tall tree-palms in Wahroonga’s Presby-
terian kirk. The lovely trousseau was hand-
made —a stitcliery of charming craftmanship
-by the lady herself.
The Red Cross executive gets a vigorous
infusion of new blood by the recent inclusion
of Under-Secretary Darkness. A hard-work-
ing virile person, he’ll take to his hon. job a
recommendation for going straight to the
point. He occupies the chair vacated by
Mrs. Onslow, who recently resigned.
The A.M.C. dames have a big musical At
Home in the Australia —take the lift —on
October 18.
Captain F. Hyde, of our Navy, is to lead
an English widow to the altar as soon as
the war permits. She is Mrs. A. O. Trefusis,
and a Voluntary Aid whose husband was
killed on service with the Lancashires, and
is probably related to the Trefusis who
married Lady Mary Lygon, ex-Governor
Beauchamp’s sister.
The recent publi-
cation, by Tyrrell’s,
of Dorothy Drewett’s
“Sundown Stories”
for kiddies brought
forward a promis-
ing black-and-white
artist in Ethel
Wood. Some of the
old nursery yarns—
served up in a new
way by the writer —
got a fresh lease of
life with the aid of
some spirited little
sketches. Such a
standing dish as
“The Queen of
Hearts” —and Tarts
—for instance, put
in a fresh claim for
notice when Ethel Wood showed a hungry
urchin taking a large bite out of the royal
pastry. Born in England, the artist studied
at Birmingham Art School, which is affili-
ated with South Kensington. As one
of its successful students, Miss Wood
was given the chance of going through
short studies in black and white at
the parent college in London. In
Sydney for the last six years she has been
busy at decorative work, heads and tails for
letterpress, bookplates, and some black-and-
white work for Australian papers. “There
was no art in my family,” she laughs—“ex-
cept the sister art of music. My father
was a church organist, and my mother was
not only a fine pianist, but even now retains
a beautifully-trained contralto voice.”
There’s modesty about the artistic sense of
one’s family. May Moore is responsible
for the photo.
Brisbane’s contribution: —
The Red Cross Society, which has gone along for
quite a year without any quarrels, is at it again.
This time the fuss is over a motor-car, which is used
in connection with the Red Cross kitchen. No
question about it, this war is no joke.
Lieut.-Colonel F. C. Wooster, who used to be medi-
cal superintendent of the Rockhampton General Hos-
pital, was married in London, on September 7, to
Kitty Moir, of Rockhampton, daughter of the late T.
Moir.
John H. Flower, a prominent man in the legal
community, died on Tuesday morning. He was a
courtly and kindly old gentleman who did many a
good turn.
The Brisbane Austral Choir had their Gounod Cen-
tenary concert in the Exhibition Hall on Saturday
night, with “The Redemption” as the foundation.
Mrs. S. B. Harris (who will be remembered in Sydney
as Evelyn Selig) sang the soprano solos.
Matron Dadswell, who has been head of St.
Helen’s Hospital for years, is to be married shortly
to H. Robinson. The other night Dr. and Mrs.
Sandford Jackson gave a farewell dinner to the
bride-elect.
The Brisbane Operatic Players are staging “The
Dairymaids” on October 26. Mrs. Arthur Hunter
has arrived to give the final polish to chorus and
principals, and everyone is rehearsing madly. Arthur
Crane takes the part he had in the original J.C.W.
production in Sydney years ago, and pretty Mrs.
Roy Purves (once Lorna Paterson of The Follies)
will do the solo dancing.
A new money-raising scheme for Jack’s
Day comes from Mrs. James Ashton, of the
Red Cross executive. She, Helen Laidley,
Audrey Johnston, Joan Rolin and other
beauteous damsels will hawk choice fresh
fish from door to door. Their beat will be
round Double Bay, Darling Point and
Darlinghurst. The fishwives start early on
this coming Friday morning.
Though Soldiers’ Dependants’ Day had an
urgent cause behind it, and glorious Spring
weather, the results, as feared by the organ-
isers, were disappointing. Not only was the
early publicity given to Jack’s Day a source
of weakening public interest, but a stony-
hearted Repatriation Department knocked out
that strenuous money-maker the chocolate-
wheel. As the first big day to suffer from
this severe cut in the takings, it was hard
luck. The harmless joy of seeing a wheel
spin round, while the loquacious genie in
fancy dress who presides over the fate of
countless chocolate-boxes goads the loser to
chance another sixpence, ought not to worry
anything but a Methodist Synod. A harm-
less form of revenue and fun has been cut
off in the prime of its usefulness. And
the soldiers’ kiddies get less jam on their
bread in consequence.
The procession for the day (October 11)
was full of vivid pictorial groups. The dra-
matic tableau of Belgium defending herself
against the brut"' invader, was equal to any
seen on much bigger gala days.
Dorothy damming has sent for her mother
and sister to join her in New York. The
Sydney girl, as I told you recently, is draw-
ing a £5O-a-week salary under Belasco’s man-
agement.
~A stirring account of Australians in
France was given by Dr. Purdy, D. 5.0..
recently a colonel in the A.M.C. —-in civil
life he is Sydney’s chief health-officer-
before a packed meeting of the various Sol-
diers’ Wives and Mothers’ Centres in the
Town Hall vestibule. Lady Davidson took
the best chair and addressed the meeting,
after Dr. Purdy had given a thrilling tale
of the celerity with which the now perfected
Medical Corps—Australian and British —can
move a wounded man from No Man’s Land
to a London hospital. “It can be done in
36 hours,” said he, “and I’ve known cases
where it took no longer than that to get a
wounded man into the bed of a militar3 r
hospital across the Channel.” Dr. Mary
Booth was in charge of the meeting.
A little group of Sepoys in Ilochst china
(1790 was the year of its production) was
bought by Mr. Walter Swinson at the recent
sale of the Ilackett Art Collection in Syd-
ney. This rare old china is alleged to go
to the heads of European collectors, who
have given (before the war) up to 1200
guineas for a fine sample.
The Bulletin’s Oldest Inhabitant is a
proud man to-day. His grandson, in his
first twenties, who enlisted in Sydney as a
private and worked his way up to the com-
mand of a battalion, has been given the
D.S.O. for conspicuous bravery on the
Western Front. He had been previously
mentioned in despatches, and at 21 was the
youngest major in the service. His elder
brother won his commission on the field in
France two years ago.
Another pretty British V.A.D. has appro-
priated an Australian soldier. The capitula-
tion was made by Captain Stanley Walker,
one of our bird-men, who led ‘ Anne S.
Griffith, of Dolgelly (Wales) down the aisle
iu her native town. Colonel Anderson, of
Ballarat (Vie.), was second-best man. The
bride was a hospital worker, and soldiers and
nurses formed a guard of honor for the
orange-blossoming in the old town.
The “Eyes of Youth,” at the Palace,
attracted as many people to the theatre as
the management could squeeze in. The
“Eyes” belonged to Emelie Polini, who was
only condemned by the playwrights to wear
one frumpish frock —as the school-marm in
the years that might have been if dull duty
had been her goal—and one very straight
feather in the final scene. Otherwise the
distracted heroine was beautifully garbed in
filmy drapery trimmed with pale-blue true-
lovers’ knots. In the stalls Mrs. Alex. Hay,
who came in with hubby, wore an oyster-
satin wrap over a delectable frock. ' The
Spencer Bruntons had a party, which in-
cluded Mrs. Charles Waldron and Mrs.
Kegan. In one of the boxes a lone male was
chaperoned by three smart damsels who
looked sufficiently clad to be mistaken
for a surfing party. Mrs. Steer Bowker was
with the Arthur Sehute couple—the lady
smartly gowned in a confection that foamed
over with black tulle.
The long-looked-for day when the South
Sydney Hospital would have its own X-ray
theatre has arrived. Governor Davidson
last week gave his blessing both to the new
apparatus and to the Flashman Laboratory
which he opened. The ceremony happened
to clash with a race-day, but his Ex. won't
hear the dulcet notes of Short Odds till
Peace —the genuine article—is cemented.
The Walter and Eliza Hall Trust, by the
way, gave a generous helping of cash
towards the X-ray apparatus.
The slender brown-eyed Melbourne girl
who wrote “Painted Clay,” Doris Kerr, is in
Sydney. She was in the crush at the Society
of Artists’ show on the opening day. She’s
a niece of the late Barcroft Boake, author of
“Where the Dead Men Lie.” The brainy
damsel whispered tidings of a second book
in the publisher’s hands.
In 1917 the
National Gallery of
N. S. Wales bought
thr e e pen-and-ink
sketches by a com-
paratively unknown
young artist named
Lloyd Rees (hereto his
photograph). Since
then tlie Queensland-
er has settled to work
in Sydney with the
Smith-Julius firm.
He has imagination
and a rapidly im-
proving style, and
has a tendency to
weave fact and fic-
tion into composi-
tions that are partly
fantasies. An old
“colonial” house, mellow in color and pictu-
resque in shape, recently caught his fancy.
TheMjouse is out Bondi way. But the hill
that goes with it topped Double Bay flats.
Lloyd Bees applied the artist’s prerogative
and arranged a meeting between a bit of
early Sydney architecture and a handsome
old hill called Bellevue. The result, as the
“House in Valley,” is a powerful, if sombre,
pen-and-ink drawing. The Gallery trustees
secured it last week at the Society of Artists'
show. A private buyer gave 20 guineas for
another picture by this original craftsman,
on the catalogue marked as “A Land-
scape.” Rees, in spite of precarious health,
is a hard worker. He makes sketch after
sketch, tearing up one after another till he
gets near the mystic picture of his dream.
The young artist was born in Brisbane. His
father is an Australian of Welsh descent; his
mother is French. Both parents encouraged
their son’s love of art, and "allowed him to
give up the job of adding up other people’s
bank accounts to follow his inclinations. In
Brisbane he studied under the sympathetic
R. Godfrey Rivers, then head of the Central
Technical College, and now in Hobart.
Dr. and Mrs. Gerald Sheahan, of Mel-
bourne, have been sniffing up the ozone at
Coogee. Even the arrival of an Armada of
Portuguese man-o’-war, the little sea-stinga-
rees. hasn’t kept either the medico or Walter
Toohey (another Victorian) out of the surf
on fine mornings.
October 19 is the date of the big rose-
leaves party in Centennial Park. There’s to
be a military gymkana on the same after-
noon in the big playground. Jack’s Day
gets the results.
The shadow of Jack’s Day fell across Sol-
diers’ Dependants’ Day. Beginning on Oct.
16 there will be five evening harbor concert
trips. Tickets 25., and details at Paling’s.
If the freak skirt which appeared in iso-
lated oddments during Race Week gets much
narrower at the ankles —it puffs at the hips
—woman won’t care whether the tram fares
are higher or not. She won’t be able to
step on to the footboard.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

REPAIR jobs that seem hopeless to you are child’s to the Oxy-
Acetylene Welding Operator.
Oxy-Acetylene Welding is the remedy for breakdowns involving
broken parts of machinery in manufacturing plants, workshops, mines
and on the farm • it saves priceless time, and in most cases saves the
entire cost of a new machine.
Here is a bad break in an
Iron Casting that looks a hope-
less case.
\
But the Oxy-Acetylene Weld-
ing Process saved it from the
scrap-heap without any trouble.
The buying of spare parts is banished by the Oxy-Acetylene
Welding Process, which repairs broken sections of machinery
speedily and permanently —making the weld just as strong as
the main body of the metal.
THE OXY-ACETYLENE WELDING AND CUTTING
PROCESS makes big metal-working operations little and pre-
vents little troubles from getting big. Its uses are without end
wherever metals have to be cut or joined. It shears giant armor-
plates with the same ease with which it repairs the broken handle
of a kitchen utensil.
In Industrial Plants, Foundries, Engineering Works, Mines,
Shipbuilding Yards, Steel and Iron Works Oxy-Acetylene
Welding and Cutting is in constant use for constructional metal
work and for making rapid repairs.
FARMERS! Instead of wasting days in sending for new parts,
ask us for the address of the nearest Oxy-Acetylene Welding
Plant.
HOUSEHOLDERS! The rubbish-box is no place for metal
household utensils with broken handles, etc. You can have them
repaired cheaply by the Oxy-Acetylene Process. Ask us for the
name of nearest operator.
If you have to cut or join metal, write for
particulars of the Oxy-Acetylene Process to
You would think that it was impossible to repair
these east-iron brackets, but they were made as good
as new, as shown below.
Oxy-Acetylene Welding saved the expense of these
new castings, and, what is more important, it saved days
of delay.

My Dear Yarrie, —
The G.-G. and Lady Helen save a garden
party on Saturday afternoon to meet General
Pau and the French Mission. The wild
weather drove the party indoors, where de-
lightful impromptu arrangements were made
for entertainment. Lady Stanley, in a blue-
ribboned black hat and a Spring frock, had
her children there to dance with Lady
Helen’s small niece. There were 10 or 12
V.C.’s at the party. Captain Symonds,
V.C., had his young English bride with him;
she was happy and proud, with blue eyes
shining under a blue-ribboned hat. French
Consul Fliche was radiant. General Pau
wore his grey-blue greatcoat and some
dazzling decorations. The G.-G. sported a
diamond-and-ruby star as big as a man’s fist
on his neat, pale-grey afternoon suit—a
quaint effect. Lady Helen’s dress was pale
champagne cloth, tailored in pleats. A big
fiat hat topped the costume. Lady Doris
Blackwood had daisies in her garden hat.
All the vice-regal persons available went
to Her Majesty’s on Saturday night in honor
of General Pan, for whom a special perform-
ance of “Oh, Boy!” was given. The G.-G.
and Lady Helen were in the right-hand box,
Lady Helen dazzling everyone with her dia-
monds. Lady Stanley and our State Ex.
sat in the left-handi pen. The Stanley lady
was magnificent in white tulle with pearls.
General Pau had the centre of the circle.
He speaks no English, and was placed
between Willie Watt and his wife, neither of
whom speak French. Melba sat three seats
away beyond the Gaud Mayor and his wife.
She speaks French fluently, and could have
entertained the old soldier.
The Caulfield Guineas on Saturday began
the Spring racing; but sassiety wasn’t there
in force on account of the big Government
House function that afternoon for General
Pau. At a lunch-party given by the
stewards the guests of honor were Comman-
dant Montalva, of the Chilian frigate, and
some of his officers. They went on to Gov-
ernment House after the second race.
St. A incent’s Hospital silver jubilee stirred
Melbourne last week. The Papal Delegate
was visiting the city, big church functions
happened every day. and the Papal flag
waved over St. Pat’s. St. AYncent’s
had a big demonstration in the Exhibi-
tion, and the vast barn was crowded.
Small boys hung like sparrows from every
projection of the packed balconies. Some
gorgeously-gowned prelates preceded Delegate
Cattaneo and Archbishop Mannix, and the
Noble Guard (100 of them) paraded in the
same dress as the Noble Guard at the ATati-
can. They marched the full length of the
Exhibition with tall white helmet plumes
nodding, their swords at salute and banner-
bearers carrying the Papal flag. Young boys
of all the R.C. colleges marched before them
and formed a background on the platform
with the medical fraternity of St. AYncent’s.
Several visiting archbishops were there fully
robed, and each had a huge ruby burning on
ring or cross.
Papal Delegate Cattaneo is a delightful old
man with a sense of humor. When he spoke
he made the vast crowd rock with laughter.
He has learnt English with the richest'lrish
brogue. At times he appealed, with a ges-
ture, to Archbishop Mannix for a lost word,
and that serious cleric had to smile at the
whimsicalities of the warm-hearted Italian.
Alberto Zelman and his orchestra played, a
<on? lr s , ai Ag> and Cacialli’s voice toned in
I aust.” Supper was served and bioscope pic-
tures were shown in the arena; but the
crowd was sb vast that the later proceedings
were chaotic. The prelates got with diffi-
culty to their waiting row of motors.
Some English visitors here remarked that
the opening of Father Robinson’s church at
Camberwell the other Sunday was like
Derby Day in England. Every possible
kind of vehicle rattled out, and only the
earliest comers got inside the fane. The
ceremony was at three o’clock. By noon
there were thousands crowded outside,
while every niche was packed within. Those
on the outside saw only the gilded dome
and the wonderful doors. But they had
the advantage of the fresh air.
Commandant Montalva, of the visiting
Chilian frigate, invited guests to tea on the
boat on Friday afternoon. The craft is
berthed at the New Pier, and the unexpected
arrival of a troopship put the party plans
rather out of action. Guests were bailed
up by a guard and kept in the dust and
wind at the pierhead. They spent the time
cheering and waving to the homing soldiers
until they were allowed to go to their
appointment. The Chilian boat looked tiny
and compact alongside the huge, camou-
liaged transport. The captain and officers
had the deck snugly screened with bunting,
and there were big. flag-covered lounges and
some fascinating cool drinks all ready
for the visitors. Tea was served in the
commander's cabin, a spacious room, with
windows instead of portholes, and tiny mus-
lin curtains blowing. Very dinky.
Last Friday, when a clutch of V.C.’s and
a boatload of soldier-invalids were given a
rousing welcome back to Melbourne, one
husky lass constituted herself a special com-
mittee of welcome to the returned boys, As
each car passed she clapped her hands
heartily, calling out “Welcome ’ome! Well
done, lads!” in piercing tones. The boys re-
sponded nobly and wrung her hands until they
must have ached. Presently along came a car
with the cover up and a solitary young officer
seated within, leaning rigidly forward with
his hands clasped over his walking-stick.
Doreen was somewhat dazed for the moment
in the presence of so much dignity. Still, she
hesitated only for the fraction of a second.
Stepping up, though perhaps with a shade
less confidence than usual, she peered under
the hood and smiled brilliantly. “Well done,
'Grace!” she cried, and the delighted crowd
howled for joy.
Captain Richard Garland, of Melbourne,
who saw service in the Boer disturbance and
was the first editor of the Commonwealth
Military Magazine (long since gone into
retirement for. the duration of the present
war), has resigned from his steady job in
the Censor’s Department. He was one of
the few men on the staff with experience
both as soldier and general journalist. His
dad used to run the Star at Horsham (Vic.)
and Captain Dick went through the mill
there.
Bob Greig’s brother (stage-name Laurie
Harding) is coming home from France on
furlough, after trying to break his neck in
an aeroplane smash.
Flight-Commander Syd Dalrymple, son of
the Toorak Dalrymples, has been awarded
the Distinguished Flying Cross for great
work done in Italy, whither he went after
flying in France. He fell once and nearly
broke in halves. Before the war the D.F.C.-
winner was a keen golfer.
Lieut. Francis Rupert Johnson, son of
the late Francis Johnson, of South Yarra,
has been killed in action. He was a nephew
of the late David Syme.
Anglican padre Harold Davies, who is a
son of Canon Davies, of Ballarat, has been
heard from again, a long way from home.
When the war started young Davies was in
England doing some divinity-studies, and
went over to France as chaplain to a Brit-
ish regiment. Some time ago he was taken
prisoner and now reports himself as being
in a West. Prussian camp, after some hos-
pital experiences and a lot of tracking across
country in slow trains. He is interned with
several hundreds of British officers and is
the only padre in the bunch.
Alderman Cabena is Melbourne’s new
Gaud Mayor. Rabbit
fur flew last week in
the Town Hall when
the result came out.
Gaud Mayor S tap-
ley was regarded as
a certain winner for
this year’s sprint,
and he didn’t take
his defeat well. His
supporting council-
lors howled round
him while he moaned
that he had still
some time to go be-
fore the dethrone-
ment, and would
have to work with a
council out of tune.
This is a portrait of
Cabena, by Data-
yette. Ilis chest is already expanding for
the chain of office.
J. B. Ronald, ex-M.11.R., with a son at
the Front, also scents the battle from afar,
though the odor thereof is almost obscured
by that of sealing-wax and red-tape. He
holds down a steady Navy Office job nowa-
days.
The Braille Writers for the Blind are to
have a Cinderella Dance on October 30 in
the City Hall, Prahran. It will be the first
ball for blind people ever held in Australia.
James Williamson lias been volunteer-
ing dancing lessons to blind soldiers, and
they are getting great fun out of the novelty.
The girls will ask if they may have the
pleasure. Tickets from the Braille Writers’

Stella Power sang well, but had a rival in
Dorothy Murdoch.
The Bertie Austin pair are tracking to
Palestine at the end of the month to report
on the doings of the Y.M.C.A. unit in the
Holy Land.
Matron Murphy, from India, spent a
week-end with Melba at Coombe. Doris
Blackwood and some visiting inter-State
genthelps were also included in the house
party. The matron is a delightful woman
from County Cork, who was army-nursing in
India and Egypt long before this war. She
was one of the “Regulars,” and went through
Netley, and is one of Queen Alexandra’s
nurses. She wears an imposing badge, as
well as the ribbon of a decoration. But the
special joys of the Alexandra nurses are the
grey shoes and stockings. She has the
coveted scarlet stripe of 1914 and the four
blue stripes for the years following. Matron
Murphy belongs to the Forrest clan; she is
visiting her cousin, wife of Dr. Forrest, of
Charters Towers, now in Melbourne. The
visitor is on furlough from Bombay and re-
turns to India almost immediately.
Other talent than singing comes out of
Bendigo. Ada
McKenzie-Moore has
just had a book

novel about doings
on a squatter’s sheep-
run on the Murray.
Esther Paterson has
produced an effec-

proud mother of three boys. Mina Moore is
responsible for this striking portrait.
Colonel Syd Sands is busy piloting the
French visitors about Melbourne. Mrs.
Sands and the children are staying at Ye
Okie England Hotel, Heidelberg.
Edward Sparrow, who died at East Mel-
bourne the other day, had a long connection
with Western District racing. He didn’t
allow pleasure to interfere with business,
however, and stuck to his auctioneering from
his youth up, with excellent financial results.
Out of his myriad reminiscences, Sparrow
was perhaps fondest of telling how, as a
clerk for the firm of which later he became
the whole works, he signed the delivery-book
for the first batch of English sparrows ever
sent to his district. They were consigned to
the late Thomas Austin, of Barwon Park.
Sparrow married a daughter of the late
James Wilson, of St. Alban’s who survives
him.
Adelaide’s gossip:—
A. J. Roberts earned his 0.8. E. just to hand.
From the beginning of the war he has given himself
unsparingly to patriotic work, and his services as a
recruiting speaker alone deserve the recognition.-
The list of local women’s war work is to be added
to by a motor detachment. About 20 names were
enrolled at a preliminary meeting at Government
House. The duties of members will be to take
wounded and convalescent men about.
The F. H. Snows have had word that their son
Wilfred has been granted six months’ furlough and
is on his way home. He has been flying in France
since May, 1916, in which time he has won his
majority, the D.S.O. and the M.O. Capt. “Jimmy”
Throssell is also on his way home.
Capt. C. J. Clare is to take Capt. Burford’s place
as this State’s Naval Commandant. He was in charge
of a South Aus. naval contingent to China in connec-
tion with the Boxer rising, and was commandant of
our naval forces when they were under State. control.
Nurse Morrison, who served with the British Red
Cross at Mons, Gallipoli and Serbia since she left the
Adelaide Hospital, is convalescing from three wounds
in her arm. A chivalrous German airman did it
with his little machine-gun.
The South Aus.-Victorian vice-regal party divided
its time at Pirie between inspection of the smelters,
Red Cross meetings and a visit to the new Children’s
Playground.
Two more war honors to South Australians—a bar
to his Military Cross and his majority to Capt. R. K.

Booked for matrimony in August, Cecely,
daughter of the Grey-Egerton baronet, who
married Rupert Clarke’s ex-lady (nee Cum-
mings), and Colonel Deyns Prideaux-Brune,
ot the British Army. A Prideaux-Brune, of
the A.1.F., married one of the Garvan girls
of Sydney.
It’s bachelor Theodore Beggs, M.L.C., of
Eurambeen station, who has prevailed on
one of the TV alpole girls to share Ills acres
and fireside. The tvedding is to take place
within a month or two. Nephew Balcombe
Beggs also married a Walpole daughter a
few years ago. Dad Robert Walpole, by
the way, was the speaker who declared at a
public meeting, while secretar. ■ of the
Employers’ Federation, that marriage was
a “luxury.” It has taken a lot of time and
effort for Robert to overtake the unfortunate
words and eat them, one by one.
Bertha Latham, second daughter of W.
L. Baillieu, is to wed one Ramsay on
October 2.'!. and great preparations are in
progress. The bridegroom is a returned sol-
dier.
Mrs. John Ross (once Ur. lsabei
Younger) has acquired a baby son. Mother
now has a chance of putting her theories into
practice. She took an active interest in
the establishment of the Baby Clinic in
Melbourne and in the promotion of baby wel-
fare generally.
Melba's grand-daughter, Helen Pamela
Fullerton Armstrong, went home to Coombt*
Cottage for the first time last week. She is
named Helen after the illustrious Nellie,
but the family is already calling her “Pam."
She’s got a voice, too!
When Irma Caron sang the Marseillaise
at the Civic reception to the French Mis-
sion General Pan expressed his pleasure
with the singer’s effort by kissing the little
lady’s hand. Incidentally, the Missioners
must have been bored to death by the long
speeches of Willie Watt and other wordy
politicians. The Town Hall was full of
people anxious to see and do honor to
General Pan and his colleagues, but before
the big Frenchman got a chance to say a
word the hall was beginning to empty. It
was a heavy blow.
Mrs. Ernest Scott (otherwise Emily Dya-
son) is off to Castlemaine, where she will
assist at the concert to be given by local
violinist Elise Steele. If the residents
rise to the occasion it is purposed to send
Elise to Sydney next year to study the Ver-
brugghen method.
Mrs. Cadorin (once Lovie Mueller, of Ben-
digo) and her husband are busy in America
doing propaganda work. Cadorin fought in
Italy, but was sent back to America on
account of his health. His country then
engaged him to tell Italy’s war story to the
Americans. Mrs. Cadorin is singing at the
lectures, which are to be given throughout
the States.
Melba is packing up for Sydney. She
leaves on Saturday, and will sing with the
Verbrugghen orchestra before she returns.
(Obviously she can’t sing from here by long-
distance telephone.)
Mrs. Mabel Brookes, who recently made
her bow as an authoress, will shortly publish
a second novel, “On the Knees of the Gods,"
a feature of which will be an account of
experiences in an English military hospital.
.As president of the Australian Art Associ-
ation, Edward Officer gave a luncheon to
leading members of the local brush brother-
hood at the Frangais the other day. Norman
Mac George told Edward exactly how mucli
those present thought of him, and Bernard
Hall and etcher John Shirlow added the post-
scripts.
Jimmy Waters, Perlmuttering in “Busi-
ness Before Pleasure,” is likely to become
a favorite with local femininity because of
his resemblance to Julius Knight. Not onlv
does he recall the missing idol in face and
figure, but when he is speaking you have
only to shut your eyes to mistake his voice
tor that of Sunerbus.
American nurses mostly spend three years
in training—it’s sometimes four—but there
are post-graduate courses which many of
them take. And there’s hardly a more popu-
lar course than this welfare or settlement
work. Several of the leading Universities
give it their best attention.
A new Chinese cafe, The Oriental, is just
opened in Swanston-street, Melbourne, in
charge of young Chinese ladies. This makes
the fifth superior Chinese cafe in Melbourne.
Ihe first was the Pekin Caf<§, in Russell-

Lourke-street (quite a different Little
Bourke-street to that of earlier days) ; the
important Canton Cafe, Swanston-street,
near Her Majesty’s Hotel; and the equally
resplendent Nankin Cafe, Bourke-street.

The Black Diamonds Swear by REXONA,
We all swear by Rexona, for we think it is truly the Rapid Healer and most wonderful oint-
ment we have ever come across. We have used it at the Front when on Active Service in France
and Gallipoli, and found it unequalled for the minor injuries which were forever occurring. It is no
less a friend to us here at home, and we shall sing the praise of Rexona wherever we go. You
have no idea what a godsend Rexona Soap and Rexona Ointment are to the boys at the Front,
and we heartily recommend them to all our friends.
Wishing Rexona the best of good luck, Sincerely yours,

Gives Natural Beauty to Skin and Hair
That natural beauty of skin and hair which cannot be imitated can be obtained by regular use of Rexona Skin and Facial Soap. Ordinary Toilet
Soaps do not assert this influence. Many of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and destroy its delicate texture. Fven t e es
of such soaps can only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin. Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, antiseptic >a sams as
Rexona the Rapid Healer, the value of which in the treatment of skin affections is known throughout the world. Simply use Rexona Skin an<
Facial Soap regularly once or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples, am ea\e e
complexion clear, fresh and velvety.

REXONA SOAP for Health and Beauty.
Why not be a Rexona Girl, too? Rexona and Rexona Soap ensure that clear,
fresh skin and beautiful hair which go so far to give any girl that natural charm
and beauty which is her rightful heritage.
To shampoo or wash the hair with Rexona Soap is an easy task, but the results
are startling. It leaves the hair in such a beautiful condition, the scalp perfectly
clean and wholesome. The hair becomes light and fluffy, waving about the face in
abundance, as beautiful hair should always appear. Rexona Soap leaves a delicate
perfume, invigorating the roots of the hair, which prevents greyness. A few shampoos
with Rexona Soap effectively removes every trace of dandruff or loose and falling hair.
Radies who use it for the hair say that Rexona Soap is far better than any of the
so-called hair tonics.
TRY THE REXONA TREATMENT.
Rexona Soap and Ointment are universal favorites with everyone who values a
pure and healthy skin. The longer you neglect your skin the harder it will he to care
for it. Delay may result in Eczema, Ringworm, Running Sores, or some of the
many and unpleasant forms that skin trouble so often assumes. Rexona the Rapid
Healer and Rexona Soap are sure preservatives for the health and skin. Rexona
Soap keeps the skin soft and pure, and Rexona the Rapid Healer will immediately
eradicate any disease which may he apparent, for it arouses the skin to healthy
activity, so that it quickly recuperates.
Buy a tablet of Rexona Soap from your Chemist or Storekeeper. It is- beautifully
put up and sold at 1/- per tablet, or you can get it in boxes, containing tdiree tablets
in a box. Rexona is supplied only in triangular pots, at 1/6, or in larger pots, holding
nearly four times the quantity, at 3/«

"ON TOP" WITH
MICK SIMMONS
SURE CATCH TACKLE
The A.J.C. must have had a record or two
in connection with the Spring meeting this year.
The crowds at. Randwick were enormous. Whether
it was on account of the attendances being greater
than ever before, or because of the congestion caused
by the totalisator. this page cannot recollect the
squeeze having been so sustained on any previous
occasion. It is fairly certain that there have not
been many meetings at Randwick at which more
money was sroing. At no other meeting have so
many times been fractured. And taking it by and
large- there have not been many at which the general
level of the racing was better —except in the matter
of the three-year-olds. The crop of horse at that
age was both limited and of moderate quality. Con-
sidering the large number of two-vear-olds raced in
the previous season it was a great disappointment
to see such a poor muster of three-yearers. This,
combined with the fact that only three Australian
four-year-olds were produced at w.f.a., suggests that
the calamities in N. S. Wales training stables during
the past year or two must have been fairly numerous.
Of nine starters in last year’s Derby only one tran-
spired at w.f.a. this year—Prince Viridis. Of the
others only one was started in any other race, and
he finished well back. None of the 18 starters in
last year’s Breeders’ Plate was a winner last week.
Five of them started—two in the Derby and three in
handicaps. Of the 21 starters in the Gimcrack last
year four came to light and finished among the also
ran. Seven out of 39 is nothing to make a paean
about, anyhow.
The totes handled £223,110 ss. during the three
days, and the amount was only limited to the capacity
of the machines to handle the business in the time
available. That so many people should want to bet
day after day and race after race on the three-divi-
dend system in vogue at Randwick and elsewhere
throughout the State, is to this writer a cause of
perpetual wonderment. But there it is ; they c-ome
at it in droves, mostly specking for places on odds
which are enough to move a German to tears of
compassion. At times during the meeting just over
there were queues a hundred long at the windows.
Some of the dividends were good, some were fair,
others were simply awful. The best dividend during
the four days was paid by Fungoid, £lB 7s. 6d. for
10s. in the Members’ Handicap. Of the others it
is a remarkable circumstance that the best dividends
for first were paid by the best-class horses —Rebus
£l5 16s. 6d. in the Epsom, Poitrel £6 14s. 6d.
in the Spring Stakes, and Cetigne £5 6s. 6d. in the
Craven. The worst dividend was also paid by a
champion—Desert Gold, 4s. for second in the Spring-
Stakes. Occasionally the bizarre incident was
noticed of a second or third nag paying more than
the winner. In the Derby the first horse paid £1 45.,
the third £2 7s. In the Metrop. Ivennaquhair yielded
£1 75., Arch Marella (second) £2 14s. 6d. There
were 24 races, and dividends on other than winners
were in 20 cases at a rate less than even money. In
seven backers retrieved less than they staked ; in 14
the dividend was 15s. or less.
The Craven Plate was made memorable by
two happenings. It was the first of her races in
which Desert Gold had omitted to run into a place.
The final stages of it were the most sensational ever
seen in a w.f.a. event in the Commonwealth. It is
impossible to conceive a six-horse race of the kind
more heavily charged with the thrill peculiar to the
turf than this. Long though racing men will remem-
ber the performance of Poitrel in running down the
Maoriland champion over the last of the Spring Stakes,
they will carry a more vivid recollection of the finish
for the Craven Plate. As usual, the mare hopped
away in front, and at the six-furlongs pole was the
best part of three lengths out from Wolaroi and
Cetigne, with Estland just astern of that pair. Cagou
and Prince Viridis were then beaten off. At five fur-
longs Wolaroi suddenly moved forward to within a
length of the leader, and on the turn Cetigne and
Estland shifted closer. The pace was terrific. They
had it all on, and even the most sanguine believers
in Desert Gold’s superiority realised that with
Wolaroi and Cetigne within striking distance she was
going to be put to a searching test, particularly as
O’Shea had taken the turn with rather more liber-
ality than seemed judicious. The mare reached the
last furlong with Wolaroi on her quarters and Est-
land close to him, the pair being on the outside,
Cetigne a length back running close to the rails on
the other side. So far as the danger threatening
from Cetigne was concerned, the gap there left was
fatal to the mare. Wood drove the horse along at a
tremendous rate, and he quickly closed on the mare,
who at the Leger rails just had her head poking in
front of Wolaroi, with Estland a few inches further
back. Twenty-five yards from the line the four
seemed dead-level. In another stride or two Wolaroi
gained an inch or two, and a great yell nearly blew
the roof off the stand. But Cetigne, galloping with
long, powerful strides, kept going too, and a dozen
yards from the judge it was clear that he had the
mare’s measure, whatever else might have happened.
Estland stuck to Wolaroi with astonishing game-
ness. Desert Gold was galloping as straight as a die
—and locked almost together the four swept past the
box. Nobody not in a direct line could pretend to
say what had occurred —but whatever it was there
were only inches for the judge to go on. He saw half
of Cetigne’s head first, detected half of Wolaroi’s next
and noticed an inch or two of Estland ahead of
Desert Gold. There were barely 18in. of variation at
the critical moment! The mile and a quarter had
been traversed in “4-A” —a record for the race and
an Australian record for the distance.
Having been given the knock twice Desert
Gold was not given a start in the Randwick Plate,
two miles, run on the last day, owner Lowry relying
on Estland, a Derby winner in M.L., and whose third
in the Craven had been a conspicuously meritorious
effort. The others were Prince Viridis, Rebus and
Lingle. The pace for the first mile was painfully
slow. The Prince at about that point ran past
Rebus into the lead and sharpened up the movement.
With four furlongs to go Estland ran up to the
leader, but the little chap came away again and was
a length in front half-way up the straight, Rebus a
length behind Estland, and Lingle a couple further
astern. From that on Estland, who had McLachlan
aboard, and Prince Viridis, with Barden on top,
settled down to an all-in struggle for the line, and
the Maorilander, creeping up inch by inch, just
touched it off in the last couple of strides. Rebus,
who seemed to find the weight a -nuisance, was a
length off, and Lingle, running on, but without any
ginger, was last by an equal remoteness. The time
was only moderate —3min. 30|sec. —though it may
be said' that the race had been twice less rapidly
run in the last nine years. Over the same distance
at Flemiiie-ton last Autumn Wallace Isinglass just beat
Desert Gold in “26J.” In a sort of wav, therefore,
Lowry had vengeance on Old King Coal. *
Among good judges, or at any rate among
those whose judgment is worth listening to, there
was considerable difference of opinion about the
reasons for what happened to Desert Gold, after
it was all over. There were some who inclined to
the view that she has done some of her dash. As
she is a six-year-old mare and has done an extra-
ordinary amount of travelling and racing, this would
seem a more reasonable conclusion if it had not required
record-breaking performances to beat her by a few
inches. Another opinion is that the lady was not
at her best—that her trainer had been a little
sparing of her to avoid overdoing things with Mel-
bourne engagements still ahead. There is not much
in that. At least it is heavily discounted by the
great races she ran, her condition on pulling up
and the gaiety of her work on the track on the fol-
lowing- days. There is a further opinion that
O’Shea had got too much into the habit of regarding
himself as a passenger, and thinking that a wooden
riding to orders would always meet the situation. The
writer is disposed to think that this opinion goes
very close to the bull’s-eye. Both in the Spring
Stakes and the Craven it was clear that O’Shea took
the turn without artistry, and reckoned each race
to be then over. Had he pushed the mare along a
bit thereabouts in the Spring Stakes Poitrel would
never have reached her. Had he closed on the
rails Cetigne could not have won the Craven. But
the rock-bottom of the thing is that in the Craven
she met better horses than she had ever .met before.
Cetigne was not at his best when thev came together
in the autumn. It was the first fly with Wolaroi —
on his day one of the most brilliant horses over a
middle distance ever raced at Randwick.
The imported Publican is certainly a fine,
bold galloper—when he gets away in front. His
expeditious settlement of a welter eight furlongs at
Tatt.’s meeting just before the Epsom was an im-
pressive deed and one which would probably have
earned for the horse much more cargo in the big
mile if the handieapper had noticed it before instead
of after the weights transpired. On Saturday, with
Bst. 101 b., the nag gave everything in the Final
Handicap an all-the-way view of his tail, winning
easily by a couple of lengths and running the mile, a
furlong and 100 yards in “581,” which was a record
for the race and distance. Publican’s failure to do
better in the Epsom can apparently be put down to
dislike of company and to being hurried by something
else at the end. Anyway, in that race he had every
chance and declined to come on. All of which sug-
gests that if he had got first out quite a crowd of
people would have been made happier. Publican is
owned by an affluent pearl man in Bananaland, and
has now taken a trip up yonder to let Brisbane have
a look at his paces. *
The Rananaland-boomed horse Amberdown
who was handed top-weight (9st. 61b.) for last year’s
Epsom and declined the offer without thanks, trans-
pired for the first time at Randwick last week. He
was a frost. They started him three times, and at
no stage did he look like doing the trick. He is a
nice-looking horse and a fine, even mover, and
appeared to be particularly well. But he began slug-
gishly every time, and slow beginners over short
courses at Randwick are not the sort that get away
with the swag.
Both hurdle-races at the A.J.C. meeting
were won by favorites. In the two steeplechases one
favorite fell and the other broke up. As punters
were taking less than three to one in each steeple
the calamity seemed to be just about what they were
looking for. And they were a pretty poor lot of
’chasers, too. Old Mungindi ran “about three miles
and a furlong” last year at Flemington in 6min.
19fsec. On Saturday last, at Randwick, 6min.
sj6j-sec. was occupied in journeying “about three
miles.” Of course the uphill bit at Randwick counts
for something; so, too, on the other hand, do the
bigger jumps at Flemington. Of seven starters on
Saturday fully three were there at the end. Only-
five out of nine collapsed during the two-miles
steeplechase earlier in the week.
* * * *•
The Hordern colors are not in front too
often at Randwick, but they transpired at the right
place on Wednesday—to the vast astonishment of the
owner thereof. Fungoid was among the starters in
the Members’ Handicap, a mile and a furlong, and
was so confidently expected to arrive that 100’s to 3
hadn’t any takers. It was a race for three-year-olds,
and among the starters were two Derby nags and
half a dozen previous winners. At the end Fungoid
was running over everything, and there was great
glee among the few who had specked him for a place
on the tote. They drew 36 to 1. Fungoid was
ridden by young Sleigh, an apprentice in F.
McGrath’s stable, who has a habit of doing this sort
of thing.
***•.*
Two seconds and a third in successive
races at Randwick may be evidence of galloping
ability, but >is also a heart-breaking business for an
owner to look at. It was Norbury’s record up to the
middle of last week. He first ran second to Panacre
in the Tramway Handicap, then arrived behind Rebus
in the Epsom, and on the third day was astern of
Lordacre and Sir Paddington in the Suburban Handi-
cap. Carrying Bst. 81b. in the latter, he was always
favorite at 5 to 2 and 9 to 4, got off second last and
travelled on the outside nearly all the way. It was
a smartly-run mile, too —381. The way Norbury ran
through the procession from 4 furlongs made it look
a certainty had he begun with the rest. The hoodoo
must have somewhere to roost apparently.
Owner-of-Wolaroi Seaton seems to have
made a good bargain when he appropriated the
Tressady-—Formula filly Sue at the Segenhoe dis-
persal sale last season. The, young lady cost only 110
guineas, and on Saturday at Randwick took the
£1250 Gimcrack without a word of apology. She
finished with great rapidity over the concluding fur-
long, running the full distance Asec. faster than Bun-
della in the Breeders’ Plate. Bundurria, a filly by
Linacre, the property of L. K. S. Mackinnon, was
winning easily until the last hundred yards, and then
went to pieces.
Put in the sale-ring at Sydney the other
day, the best offer for Biplane was 1700 guineas. Put
what construction you like on that circumstance, and
try and remember whether for a four-year-old stallion,
a winner of two Derbies, the Craven Plate and the
Linlithgow Stakes there was ever less competition.
Owner Greenwood takes his horse back to ALL.
Eusebius, apparently, is the best of the
Victorian 3-year-olds that didn’t risk humiliation at
Randwick, and, not improbably, is the best of the
whole bunch. Nevertheless the son of Eudorus doesn’t
fill the eye as a likely winner of the Caulfield Cup.
His way of winning the Guineas suggested a doubt
as to his stamina, and didn’t give him a great
advantage over Clever Jim, the colt who had burst
into notice a week previously. A 3-year-old, Bron-
zetti, scored a lucky win in the Caulfield Cup last
year, but the evidence of the book is a strong argu-
ment against youngsters doing the trick two years in
succession.
Magpie, formerly of England, made his
second appearance before an Australian pub-
lic in the Caulfield Stakes last Saturday and
registered his second win. There was a small field
and a driving rain, which good old English con-
ditions may have suited the imported animal. Any-
how, one thought of what a wonderful great Cup
horse Lanius was expected to develop into at this
time last year. After the race the sceptics were heard
protesting that Bradfield’s alleged stableful of cham-
pions had yet to get a move #
The bearing of the Toorak Handicap on
the Caulfield Cup was rather negative than positive.
Accepting the running as trustworthy—and the go for
the Toorak mile is usually an instructive gallop—
Prince Royal and Major Bill should be considerably
better than Rael Locin in next Saturday’s event.
Also, for anything that is clear to the contrary, these
nicely weighted 4-year-olds should be as well worth
backing at the price as the imported Ethiopian and
his vaunted compatriot, King Offa. The shadow of
Lanius pursues the reputation of King Offa. The
horrible disappointment that befell punters at Flern-
ington last year may happen again next Saturday.
On the other hand, there are reassuring circumstances
in King Offa’s case. He is by the same sire as Rebus,
and he has already shown a fair amount of sense in
pushing his way through a crowded field. The pre-
sent writer, although having a genuine respect for
Wolaroi, will continue to regard King Offa as a good
thing for the Caulfield Cup, in which the most
dangerous ones appear to be among the lot weighted
at not less than 7st. or more than Bst.
“Mujik” : Wolaroi must be just about as
good now as ever he was, llis run in the Shorts at
Randwick last week when he donkey-licked Balarang
and Franco over the last half-furlong with 9st._ 71b.,
winning without fuss of any kind in “13A,” was
superlatively good. And the bit he did in the
Craven two days later was even better as a test of
pace and courage. With four furlongs to go in that
race Wolaroi seemed to put a foot wrong, and momen-
tarily lose his balance. It lost him a length and a
half at least, and though he quickly recovered and
closed the gap and beat Desert Gold home the inci-
dent accounts for tile ineh-or-two win by Cetigne.
McLachlan is positive he would have won, and won
well, but for this happening—and further that both
before and after he could at any time he chose have
run the horse past the mare. Mac has ridden both,
and gives Wolaroi the biscuit. I give him a more
than good chance in the Caulfield.

S.A. Derby was this year left pretty much
to the local horses, for Bon Vue is locally-owned
though trained in Melbourne. Public fancy, busy
among the ten starters, placed them thus: McLaeh-
lan’s Paratoo, Paterson and Bullock’s Stagegirl, Mrs.
Hawker’s Bon Vue. The last-named was a bad
fourth. Stagegirl this time got home from Paratoo
by inches. The Morphettville Plate, for two-year-olds,
was supposed to be a good thing for Dr. Bennett’s
Teucheira, but Heaslip’s St. Roseate (St. Anton —
Rose Morn) beat her comfortably. This was the
47th S.A. Derby Meeting. It ought to be the 59th,
but there were two gaps in S.A. racing till it got
firmly started again in 1890. The concluding day
of the meeting was marked by big dividends, £l4,
£l5. £22 and £5l. The totalisator takings for
the two days, £17,586, have been beaten only by a
trifle, back in 1911 and 1912.

“George H.”: It is about time the big
clubs made it compulsory for the bookmakers to
write the names of horses clearly on their betting-
tickets. I was at Flemington last Saturday and
suffered for the second time within a month through
having unreadable tickets. I was having a bad day
and thought I would try a long-odds shot on the
Adelaide horse Martino. I was* offered 20 to 1 and
took it. When I looked at my ticket I saw the
amount and a large “M” scrawled with a few fancy
flourishes, so I concluded that 1 had got my money
on all right and left to view the race. When I
returned to collect I was told that my ticket was
not for the winner, but Mazarron —another 20 to 1
chance. The “M” on the ticket was no help to me,
and when Patrick Moses further assured me that 1
must have backed Mazarron, as it was in his book, I
was helpless.
• * * *
“Sarto”: The liigh-jump record of 7ft.
5 l-sin. put up at Albury Show last month by Mrs.
.Tudd’s pony Thumbs Up didn’t last long. Her horse
Sundown cleared 7ft. 6jin. at Bendigo Show on Octo-
ber 10. Roley Doctor, the diminutive Bananaland
abo., piloted him also, and got a tenner from the
appreciative crowd. Thumbs Up (same rider) cleared
7ft. 4in. Let me see. Bendigo? Oh, yes. I re-
member. In what way will a windy little man asso-
ciate himself with the performance? Surely he will
have to draw some omparison between Sundown
getting- up so high ai Bendigo and himself (once a
sundowner) getting—ch. well, let it go at that,
though it may be thumbs down at Bendigo some day.
“Norseman”: Herewith an entry for the
long-distance gallop. A saddle and bridle camel
chased the horizon from Bourke to Wanaaring,
on the Paroo, for 118 miles. Though he didn’t catch
the skyline he got over the road in 10 hours. The
rider was not looking for ointment either.

The miners around Newcastle are having
a fine time mopping up N. S. Wales Soccer champion-
ships. A few weeks ago Weston took the State
championship; on Saturday West Wallsend smote
Balmain Fernleigh (Sydney) by 3 —l in the semi-
final of the much-valued Kerr Cup. With that success
disappeared the last hope of clubs outside the North-
ern districts sharing the Soccer plums. The belated
final between local clubs will pull down the shutters
for the season.
Old members and supporters of the Norwood
(S.A.) Football Club assisted Charles Stanley Hobbs to
celebrate his birthday last week. They did it with
some substantial looking figures on a cheque. Charles,
well known to all old-time cricketers and footballers,
had scored 80. He is a Sydneysider, and his first
job in life was being an apprentice to Henry Parkes.
Later he was a pressman in Melbourne and subse-
quently an overseer in the S.A. Government Printing-
Office. His interest in the Australian football game
has been continuous; A few years ago he came to
Sydney with the Norwoods, and as chairman of that
organisation handed the N. S. Wales Association a
competition shield from the club. The old man hit
the 81st lap going strong.
* * * * •
Some of the country schools occasionally
turn out solid all-round athletes. A promising N. S.
Wales youngster is R. G. Stanley, who bagged tin
entire programme almost at the annual All Saints'
College sports, at Bathurst. His performances were:
100yds., 104-sec. ; 220yds., 27sec. ; 440yds., 58
3-ssec. ; high jump, sft. 2in. ; broad jump, 18ft. lOin.
He also carried off the football-kicking item. A
younger brother, O. H. Stanley, did well in the
junior division, accounting for the 100yds. and
880yds. sprints and the high jump and football
kicking.
C. N. Leikvold, one of Sydney’s smartest
all-rounders, made an effort to clean up the bill o'
fare at Redfern on Saturday. There were five courses
on the menu, and the glutton got away with the
100yds., 220yds., broad jump (18ft. 4in.), hop, step
and skip (38ft. 10in.), and was third in the high
jump. A few weeks since he added the Sydney
banks’ 100yds. championship to his girdle. He cer-
tainly appears to be a handy person for a bank to
have near the door if an unscrupulous person
attempts to get away with the reserves. _ Another
athlete who shifted his legs with great rapidity last
week was M. J. Grandernange (Botany), who won a
mile from scratch in 4min. 44 l-ssec. Though the
smartest effort over eight furlongs for many years, it*
is well behind the N. S. Wales record —4min. 23sec.,
by G. A. Wheatley.
* * *
The crop of centuries in the first round of
Sydney fix-st-grade cricket was quite unusual. Dan
Gee (144) for Middle Harbor against Sydney made
the biggest hit. Othei-s in his class were A. Bogle
(’Varsity), 125; A. Punch (North Sydney), 109;
M. A. 'Noble (Paddington), 101; and J. Proud
(Waverley), 100. Gee, one of the old ’uns of Sydney
cricket, doesn’t look like wearing out for a while
yet. Fifteen years ago he and Victor Truniper put
up the Australian first-wicket record of 423 for
Paddington against Redfern, and that mountain
hasn’t been overtopped. Amid the batting deluge on
Saturday only two bowling efforts were worth noting
—L. Wall (Balmain 1, 9 for 129 against Central Cum-
bei-land; and A. Gray (Glebe), 8 for 79 against
Petersham.
“Mopoke” : At 100- yards from our humpy
stands a burnt stump. Joe, while quietly reading
The B. one day last week, sat up, reached for a new
clay pipe, carried., it off to tlie stump and coming
back, asked “Can you see that pipe?” Of course I
could. It looked as plain as a bull’s tail. “Very
Well,” he said, “‘Nimi'od’ ought to take to specta-
cles.” There is nothing out of the ordinary hitting a
pipe-bowl at 100yds. A couple of chaps I knew on the
Barnard River would back one another to hit the
top of a match-box twice out of evei-y three shots at
100yds.—and they always collected. I think Bill was
the best of the two. Anyway he could tell where
each shot landed without moving from his position.
One day, using a 44 Winchester with the 150yds.
sight up I saw him execute a black duck. He carved
the poultry clean in half. There was a chap from
Ardglen (N.8.W.) who was pretty good. He always
shot straight oft 1 the shoulder, and any rock-wallaby
that was not too far away to see could be certain of
assassination. Whatever he saw he killed. I can
show you two skins to prove what he could do.”
“Bill R.”: Game-bird hunters in Aus-
tralia are accustomed to boast of their kills in braces,
fives or even dozens, and once, according to a recent
Bulletin contributor, a South Coast shooter outed 27
wild ducks with, a single cartridge. But at pei-iods
of the year when the slob-banks of the Fergus, West-
o’-Irela'nd, teem with wild poultry sheltei'ing from the
northern winters, the duck-punt man with his swivel
gun expects nothing less than hundreds when he lets
go. The favored time for slaughter is when the
seas are lashed into foam and the incoming tide
whitens the river. Punt, cannon, hat and garments
worn by the hunter ai-e all white to synchronise with
the surroundings, and the birds are unsuspectingly
approached. Seven pounds of shot is the charge, and
a. successfully-engineered shot has been known to
kill as many as 250 birds. Swivel-gunning is not
pei'mitted in Australia.
“Nimrod” : That performaifce mentioned by
“E.S.J.” (B. 19/9/’ 18), when telling about the man
who killed a tux-key at 1284yds. with No. 4 shot,
was very doubtful. Still it seems a pity he made
a mistake in the size of the shot, because it happens
that No. 4 hasn't sufficient striking foi-ce at 100yds.
to ruffle a turkey’s feathers. This has been proved
by hundreds of accurate tests. I was once, acciden-
tally peppered with No. 4 shot hv a friend whilst
duck shooting, and got two pellets in the face.
They stung, hut did not break the skin. We paced
off the distance, and made it i 02yds. With the same
ammunition we had been killing ducks to 50yds.
And I am ready to lay 6 to 4 that my dial is no
harder than that of the man who tells the turkey-
yarn.

The various organs of your body have certain functions to

properly fulfilling their respective functions. For instance,
constipation, indigestion and other disorders of the system
are the direct result of your internal muscles being mucli
below normal —failing in their duty.

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be ea.st out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared for emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house.

Across the green fields and pasturelands,
You will see herds of peaceful cattle;
The lads are there and leaves their brands,
He is there to make things rattle.
The hedgerows are deep in their flowers.
The beautiful colors of butterflies rush to and fro;
The lads think of their friends and mothers,
Of which they have left long ago.

And hear them as the cuckoos shout;
To take a beeline home as the crow flies,
Pleased we will be without a doubt.

'“Solomon Malaprop’s” review
It is a common belief among slummocky politicians
that a profound knowledge of history is superfluous
in their calling that only bookworms and pedants
go in for it. and that it is sufficient to skim Karl
Marx and Henry George and other theorists, arid to
secure a phrase book and learn elocution. Which
isn’t quite correct. When N. S. Wales Premier
Holman went to buy a plausible gold-brick or wild-
cat from the Uorton-Griffiths firm, and thereby let
the State in for a loss which may amount in the
end to a couple of millions, he probably thought he
had come upon a new device with great possibilities
in it. Otherwise he would hardly have done what
he did. Yet if he had learned the subject by heart
.or even taken the trouble to look-up “brick” or
“cat” in the Political Cyclopaedia he might have
found that very similar building materials and
felines were sold to Ismail, of Egypt, and a hundred
unsuspecting children after him. In the same way a
recent Labor Conference said that the Government,
if it had any sense, could, by some perfectly obvious
means, construct all its public works with paper
money without interest. The articles “Bubbles,”
“Kites” and “Perpetual Motion” in the Political
Cyclopaedia, also a glance at “Shinplasters,” and the
notes of the U.S., might have cleared the
ground by showing what devices had already been
tried, which of them failed, why they failed, whether
the failure was frequent and unanimous, and whether
there seemed to be any quite new device left under
the sun. A list of currencies in Whitaker's
At,manac. showing how one paper dollar, supposed
to be worth 55., really fetches Id., and a quartette
of four-bob notes fetch, two of them 3d. and the
other two 4d., and a lot of similar matters is worth
studying, for it leads to an inquiry whether the
money got into this deplorable state by the same
means which the Australian “militants” propose, or
by better means or worse means. Even those who
propose to “wipe out” the existing banks in one
act might find guidance and enlightenment of a sort
in the articles on “Ruins.” “Mysterious Disappear-
ances,” “Iconoclasts” and “Fog.” Certainly those
people who get into power first and acquire their
knowledge afterwards do sometimes acquire know-
ledge—they learn by failing at the public expense.
But it is exasperating when.it costs £10,000,000
to enlighten a single politician while a first-rate
lamp can be bought for 20s.


STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. We
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately-.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid “cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist.
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried by thousands of
people and we have never }’et known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn't got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by
SUNSET DRUG CO.,
Cr. Goodlet & Rilev Streets, Sydney.
Try This Corn Cure.
You will never know how easy it is to
get rid of corns until you have tried
Handy Corn Cure. Nothing like it has
ever been produced.
Oh! My! Corn-pains in every nerve!
It will dumbfound you, especially if
you have tried everything else for corns—
applied in two seconds, and if it does
not cure your corns we will refund your
money.
If you have ever made a fat bundle of
your toes with bandages; used thick,
corn pressing rings ; corn pulling salves
or liquid medicines that took off more
toe than corn—well, you will appreciate
Handy Corn Cure. Try Handy Corn
Cure for any corn, callous, wart or
bunion. It never fails.
Sold by retailers at Is. per box; 3
boxes for 2s. 6d. Posted to any address

Colds will get you—
the germ is in the air.
BE as careful as you may, you’ll have a cold before the
winter is over. You can’t miss it —it’s in the air.
But why wait until a cold is on you and your throat is
sore and inflamed ? Prepare to-day, get
EJ E B OaAD KTR
% COUGH REMEDY *
Do you know that of all the
minor ailments colds are the most
dangerous? It is not the cold itself
that you need fear, but the serious
ailments it so often leads to. For that
reason every cold should be got rid
of as quickly as possible.
For this there is nothing better
than Chamber!ai n’ s Cough Remedy.
It will loosen the cough, relieve the
lungs, aid expectoration and enable
your system to throw off the cold.
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy is
good for any member of the family.
It relieves coughs of all kinds.
It is composed of things which
soothe and heal without harming the
most delicate tissues of the throat.
It acts as easily and safely on the
young as on the old.
Mothers need not hesitate to give it
to the youngest child, for it is a safe
and ideal remedy for coughs, colds,
whooping cough and bronchitis.
BE PREPARED Like many other dangerous maladies diarrhoea often comes on unexpectedly and frequently
before the patient is aware of it some serious disorder has developed. During the warm
weather attacks of this kind are very frequent and often so swift in their results that life is in danger before the physician
caii be summoned. _ . .
Those who have the interests of their family at heart keep a bottle of Chamberlain s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy on
hand for immediate use in cases of this kind. It is without doubt the best medicine prepared for diarrhoea, dvsentery and
other disorders of the bowels. If given at the first unusual looseness of the bowels the attack may be avoided but even in
advanced stages it is a quick and most effective remedy.
Never leave home without a bottle of Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy in your luggage. The excitement
incidental to travelling and change of water and food often bring on diarrhoea, colic and pains in the stomach for which
speedy relief must be obtained and Chamberlain’s Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy can always be relied upon to do this.

A Time for Strong Nerves
War-time, with its excitement and hysteria,
is a trial to the strongest nerves. To those
whose nervous systems are run-down by
overwork or worry, to those who are on the
, verge of neurasthenia, it is a time of danger,
i There is no tonic for the nerves that is
| not a tonic for every other part of the body.
There is no form of debility that does not rob
the nerves of nourishment. The remedy
therefore for nervous breakdown is a tonic
that will build up the general health, revital-
ise the blood and enable it to carry to the
nerves the elements that they need.
Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills are an ideal tonic
for this condition because they are non-
alcoholic, and neurasthenic patients should
avoid alcoholic stimulants.
Two booklets. “Diseases of the Nervous
System” and “What to Eat and How to
j Eat,” will be sent free on request by the
! Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Box 594
I G.P.0., Sydney. Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
j are sold by all chemists and storekeepers at

them. On proposing to re-export these, the
firm made application to the Customs De-
partment for a rebate ot the duty paid, but
it was informed that this could not be clone
Unless a Customs official was stationed in
the factory to see the movements attached
to the cases, a charge being made for the
watcher’s attendance at the rate ot halt-a-
crown an hour. Needless to say, there will
be no Australian-made clock-cases exported
at that rate. Evidently those ill authority
in the Customs regard the Australian manu-
facturer as being shifty and unreliable, <i
statutory declaration regarding the origin ot
the cases apparently not being regarded as
sufficient. It is a general indication ot the
stupidly suspicious attitude the Customs
adopt towards Australian industry. With
the Tariff-dodging politician and the Depart-
mental obstructionist, Australia is too
heavily handicapped for a trade race.
“D.’s” outbreak: —
This yarn dates back to that period when Vic. was
shaken by an extraordinary outburst ot amateur fire-
brigades. The Crosscut Volunteer Fire Brigade was
a young and ambitious body, and its new uniform
was gorgeous enough for comic-opera purposes. It’s
station was new, its hose-reel and other appliances
were magnificent specimens, and glittered with pol-
ished brass and red paint. All Crosscut turned out
to watch its volunteer fire-brigade at practice, and
to applaud the record runs with the reel, and the
elan with which all hands jigged the pump. Cross-
cut was confident that in the forthcoming annual com-
petitions at Ballarat its volunteer fire-brigade would
wipe up (he paddock with every other fire-brigade in
the State.- All the Crosscut Volunteer Fire Brigade
wanted now was a fire ; but fires were rare at Cross-
cut and Pillbihgle and Sodwall, the districts served
by the Crosscut Volunteer Fire Brigade. Then the
silence of the black and early hours just beyond
Sunday was broken by a sudden clatter of the new
firebell at Crosscut. The whole township turned out
in whatever clothes it could fall or crawl into —act-
ing on impulse in the dark, and there was a splendid
tush on the part of the gallant young firemen. It
never rains but it pours —there were two fires out
towards Blanket Down, and the fire-fighters got away,
(lie hose-reel team well in advance of the valiant, six
who manned the more cumbersome pump. Walk-
late’s outhouses were burning at Pile Bridge, and
Sewell’s house was afire away to the left at Dill.
At the forked roads the pump team lingered a
moment in doubt, and then swept down towards Pile
Bridge, arriving at the conflagration when the flames
were taking hold of IValklate’s dwelling. Alas! the
hose-reel was not there, the choice of the enthusi-
asts in charge having fallen upon Sewell’s- fire at
Dill, and a pump at Pi,le Bridge was as useless with-
out a hose-reel as was a ‘hose-reel at Dill without a
pump. There was nothing for it but to man the
ropes again, and tear away through the night to the
north road, and join up with the hose-reel at
Sewell’s fire. When the pump arrived at Dill, the
hose-reel, which had travelled by the south road,
made a simultaneous arrival at Pile Bridge. While
Captain Hicks, in charge of the hose-reel, cursed
helplessly at Walklate’s fire, Vice-Captain Spargo, in
command of the pump, ripped out vociferous pro-
fanity at Sewell's fire. But the latter, admitting
there was no time to lose, called his gallant lads
into action once more, and the pump thun-
dered back by the south road to connect
with the hose at Pile Bridge. But Captain Hicks,
furious at the thought of being thwarted at his
first fire, had ripped clown Walklate’s fence and
whipped his lighter vehicle across country to_ catch
up the pump at Dill. The pump team reached
Walklate’s fire in an exhausted condition, and sat
down, utterly disgusted, - to await the ultimate
return of the hose-reel. Captain Hicks's six reached
Dill, all out, and lay down, panting, in anticipa-
tion of the reappearance of the pump. Sewell’s
house, barn and stable burned to ashes; Walklate’s
property was entirely consumed, and meanwhile in
the darkest hour before the dawn the somewhat
revived pump team, tearing headlong in an easterly
direction over the south road, trailing their
machine behind them in a fond hope of effecting a
juncture before all, including honor, was lost,
crashed into i he semi-resuscitated hose-reel team
bounding desperately in a westerly direction, trust-
ing to link up with the pump and pluck brands
from the burning, and three legs and 11 ribs were
broken, and the pump was so incapacitated that
there was nothing for it but to make a doleful and
despicable return to Crosscut with the wreckage and
the casualties in the grey and scornful morning.
Her* the dithering final catastrophe* confronted
Captain Hicks. In the natural excitement of the
get-away, the large, kerosene lamp at the fire-station
had been left burning in the wide-open establish-
ment; this had been overturned in a cat-and-dog
argument, and all that was left of the Crosscut
Volunteer Fire Brigade’s fine new station was dust
and ashes. Then after a protracted and gory
fight between Captain Hicks and Vice-Captain
Spargo, the brigade disbanded in an agony of
shame, and was never heard of again.
S. Aus. industries have always been seri-
ously handicapped by not having a coal-mine
handy. Leigh Creek coal has proved too poor
in quality for ordinary use. Its calorific
value is 7000 to 7800 compared with approxi-
mately 14.000 for Newcastle coal. Experi-
ments have been made by Professor R. IV.
Chanman, of the Adelaide University, with
briquettes, and these have turned out satis-
factorily to a certain extent; but the ques-
tion has not yet been settled as to whether
cheap binding materia] can be secured to
use with the Leigh Creek article to manufac-
ture briquettes at a sufficient low cost for
them to be of commercial value. However,
the S.A. product may be utilised in other
ways. Powdered coal has proved successful
in America, and a Yankee firm that has
tested a sample of Leigh Creek considers it
would be. entirely satisfactory in a powdered
gtate. It has been found suitable for the
production of gas. and will probably be
largely- used for that purpose.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I DREAMED I paced the gloomy brink
Of a time-conquered sphere ;
And from its levels I saw sink
This world of pallid fear
Into the dark of long lost years,
Like a dim mist of tears.
Naught but the rolling vapors spun
A moisty web beneath.
Where once the revels of the sun
Fashioned Love’s rosy wreath;
And the moon, drowned in her desire,
Faded to filmy fire.
All things had passed—the lure, the light.
The lust of heart and mind ;
And mystic from the fallen night
A veiled shape through the wind
Mounted to fold me on her breast
In everlasting rest.
"Rest, rest,” she sighed, ‘‘Life is no. more.
Motion and force are still.
All fire has smouldered with the shore.
Dead is the mighty will.
Lost, rest, Oh. you who linger last,
For all that was is past.”
Forth from her hands arose like smoke
The dust of centuries.
Which to my senses swiftly woke
Strange throngs of memories.
Methonght, I breathed thereon and, lo!
I saw the pale dust glow.
I saw the bright world spin again,
The moon and sun kept time
To moving thoughts of eager men
Which upward strove to climb.
Past, present, future glories thrust
Their wonders through the dust.
' Mysterious priestess of the mist,
Who art thou?” loud I cried.
"Dreaming that all things that exist
In palsied death abide?”
“I am Life's mystery,” she said,
And bowed her close-veiled head.
“Let there be light,” I said, all-pale.
“Thy secret render me”....
I ran and rent her filmy veil
And fell on bended knee.
For meek behind the folds of space
I met my own cold face.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
BENNET took a roundabout way homo
from the office of the engineer-in-chief
at Plaza Centenario. He walked, in
order to have time to think—think hard.
Three weeks —three mortal weeks- —and not
a dollar. Old Wilson was pretty starchy,
too. As a rule, he was cordiality itself to his
senior engineers.
Bennet walked along the shady side of
Calle Maipu thinking hard and kicking him-
self. He supposed he could get enough to
live on for three weeks from the cashier, but
Wilson might drop to it, and he didn’t want
any more trouble from old Wilson just yet.
He supposed lie could run bills if he had to;
but that was not wise—not in the British
colony in Buenos Aires. He could borrow
the money, but he might be away for five
months before he could pay the debt.
Bennet turned into Luzio’s at the corner
of Bartolome Mitre deep in thought. He sat
down and ordered a cocktail, and watched it
winking at him in a dim orange glow’. Young
Luzio gave him the good customer’s glad
“Good day” and the hidden Spanish smile
that is kept for the too-good British customer
at Luzio’s. Bennet had been an excellent
customer for a fortnight. Briefly, he had
been on a tearing blow-out. Not that there
is much in that, saving its duration —a fort-
night is a bit too long. The railway engineer
engaged on “Interior Preliminary Expedi-
tions” always went on a blow-out when he
hit B.A. again. For four or five months he
works like a nigger from sunup to sundown
in hellish heat. He has a camp of uncertain
temper and uncertain color in his sole
charge, and perhaps 50 miles of intricate,
responsible work to do. By consequence he
is hard and lean and immemorially fit, men-
tally and physically, when he fetches B.A.
again. After he has gone over the ground on
rhe maps with old Wilson, he puts in his
report and sheets, delivers up his theodolite,
collects four or five months’ back-pay at from
£lO to £l5 a week, has a Turkish bath, and
proceeds to see life. In this last important
part of his job B.A. meets him more than
half-way—a good deal more.
As a rule, the blow-out lasts three or four
days—perhaps a w’eek. If it has been a very
expensive, highly-colored blow-out, you go to
Plaza Centenario to see old Wilson, w’ho
listens gravely to the lies you tell him, in-
forms you that your next expedition starts
for where you came from in a month’s time;
the chief draughtsman finds that he wants an
extra assistant in the office for a month at
£5 a week, and the thing is settled. That
was what Bennet had tried this morning. It
didn’t come off.
Wilson had said that Bennet’s next expedi-
tion started for the proposed Tristan-
Domingo loop in three weeks’ time.
“I say your next expedition, Mr. Bennet.”
“Yes, sir.”
“If I were speaking to a junior or less
capable servant of the railway, I would say
your last expedition, Mr. Bennet.”
“Yes, sir.” This was bad.
“As it is, I do not say the words; I only
make the comment for your guidance. Mr.
Cannon was able to explain the confused
levels on the Olavarria contour, fortunately
in time for my report to London. He is not
in need of temporary draughtsmen at pre-
sent, he informs me. So will you report for
duty in three w’eeks? Mr. Challis will go as
your assistant, and Mr. Towers as your
chainman. Outfit and camp arrangements
will be in your hands, as usual”—Bennet
looked up hopefully—“in three weeks from
now.” Bennet looked at the floor again.
Wilson stood up and held out Ins hand.
“I’m sorry, Mr. Bennet, but I don t think it
will do you any harm. You are too keen and
good an engineer to let it do you. any harm.
tfasta la vista— in three weeks.”
The old man smiled and Bennet went out
with eighty cents in his pocket and three
weeks’ board and lodging to get with it. He
drank his orange-colored cocktail and drifted
out into the siesta peace of Galle San Martin.
No decent way out of the difficulty presented
itself; nothing but a miracle could hope to
cope with the situation. At the corner he
met Peter Havisham, an architect of repute
—not specifically good or ill.
“Hullo, Bill; I heard you were, m town.
When did you get back?”
“A fortnight ago. Peter, take mo to the
club, buy me a cocktail, and then buy me
some lunch ; after that, take care of me as
long as you can.”
“My dear chap, of course. Anything else/
Anything more substantial I can do?”
“No, thanks. Only a temporary wash-out.
Saturday and the office closed at twelve; no
bank open and no cheque-book, and all that.
Monday will lift it.”
The' lunch seemed a very good one to
Bennet, who had not dared to look at break-
last —even Spanish breakfast. The sun
..slanted discreetly into the cool green place ;
the fountain jet everlastingly lisped up and
down; a few men drifted in, nodded and
drifted out.
Presently Bennet looked up sharply at
Peter and said: “Anything wrong?”
“No- —oh, no.”
“Anything wrong?”
“Nothing serious, Bill. .. . Know Irish
Mollie?”
Irish Mollie was a Buenos Aires institu-
tion. Prom the chorus of an American show
at the Casino she had passed with honors
into lead at the Nacional.
“Why, yes. What about her?”
“I got married while you were shooting
levels and angles at Olavarria, Bill.”
“I see. Congratulations. Mollie restive?”
“Not exactly that; and it isn't exactly
money, either. I’ve had a good five years;
there are twelve tame draughtsmen in the
office now, and I can foot any bill in reason.
But Mollie isn't reasonable.”
This was unusual. Peter, as a rule, was
discretion itself in his own affairs.
“She isn’t reasonable and she isn’t decent.
I told her the whole thing was off. Paid her
passage to New York, and saw that she
shouldn't be hard-up when she got there.
She oughtn’t to have been hard-up for a long
time after her arrival,” Peter said, sadly.
“But she didn’t go. She sold the ticket and
renewed the lease of her flat for six months.
Last night she rang me up at home and sent
me a message by my wife. That was a damn
dirty trick.”
“It doesn’t sound like Mollie. What’s her
game?”
“I dunno. She has mentioned your name
once or twice, Bill. She seems to think a
good deal of you. I was wondering if you
could have a talk with her. I can do abso-
lutely nothing myself. You do see, don't
you ?'”
“Yes, I see, Peter. It certainly is a fix.
Lend me fifty till Monday, and I’ll see what
I can do. Where does she live?’’
“In Lavalle, No. 1081 b ; second floor. I
say, Bill, it’s awfully good of you.”
» * * *
Bennet sat by Mollie on the Chesterfield.
A purple-shaded globe threw an unearthly
light on her baby face and perfect shoul-
ders; on her frock cut to a frantically dan-
gerous depth and on her slow, meaningless
smile.
“Why didn’t you go to New York? It can’t
be much fun for you here—now.”
“Business in 8.A., Billy dear.”
“What business?”
Mollie sat up. She liked Bill; but this
was a bit thick. The fine eyes that redeemed
the baby face snapped.
“Speakin’ out o’ yoitr turn, ain’t you,
8i11?.... I was reared outside Nashville, in
Tennessee, on a farm. I left a kid brother
there.”
Bennett stood up and walked to the bal-
cony door. He didn’t expect this; he didn’t
like this at all.
“Ever since he was as big as a minute he
could ride anything with four legs, and when
he left the farm, too, he grew into a jockey
and rode in nth class Hurdles and Oshkosh
and Painted Post Handicaps; and sometimes
he wrote to me. He’s my business in 8.A.,
Bill. He’s here, and he’s riding Blanco to-
morrow for old Cortez-Pena in the San Juan
Cup—his first mount in a real, dyed-in-the-
wool race.”
Blanco? A whisper fumbled back to Ben-
net from that fortnight’s blow-out. Blanco?
What was it?
“When the race is over, Bill, I’ll go to
’Frisco or Coney Island —anywhere out of
this hole —I don’t care; but I won’t budge
till then.”
“I see. Sorry I spoke out of my turn.”
“All right, Bill. Got any money?”
“About forty gold.”
“Put it on Blanco. Good night, Billy.”
The Club lawn at the Belgrano racecourse
is a good place and a handsome; on Cup Day
it is a gorgeous place. The Club house is a
dream model of the Petit Trianon in shadowy
white, and the lawn droops to the railings,
shimmering with the colors of the rainbow
and Paris and New York. Old Zamora stands
on the terrace like Don Quijote. on guard,
and Cortez-Pena talks with him. Peter
Havisham is there. He looks frightened. All
B.A. suns itself on both sides of the sandy
track. A little breeze loiters up Rio de la
Plata from the sea and breathes on the crowd
and the lawn and the horses; the dark palms
sway in gratitude and the horses shake their
heads.
Blanco was favorite; its number was 18,
so it ought to win. That meant that the
tote would pay three or perhaps four dollars
for a two-dollar ticket. That was no good
to Bennet; he could pay Peter his fifty on
Monday and go broke again, and that was
all- The board gave Blanco’s jockey’s name
as Juarez, which didn’t sound like Mollie’s
brother, Mollie’s name was Vivienne d’Alroy
—so the playbills said. Perhaps Juarez was
just as near the truth. Anyhow. Bennet

HOME HEALING
YOU cannot get away from accidents, and you V
cannot get away from the need of Zam=Buk. \
Daily examples of Zam=Buk’s swift, clean
healing and its great utility in a thousand emergencies
justify the high claims made for this herbal “ first-aid ”
and skin remedy.
Zam=Buk is superior in this respect—its herbal extracts are ]
brought together by novel, scientific means. Ibis produces
extraordinary soothing, healing and antiseptic powers.
There is nothing that is capable of more marvellous healing and
curative action. Zam = Buk is Nature’s healer, and at the present
time, when there is a great shortage of doctors, every housewife and
every worker should ’keep a pot of Zam = Buk handy for the promp
self=treatment of any sudden wound or sore. When Zam-Buk is
applied to the bruised or broken skin any danger of the wound
taking bad ways is removed.
There are also Poisoned Sores, Ulcers and Bad Legs, Ringworms,
and Scalp Sores, burning Eczema and aggravating Piles that tell
their tale in their own weakening and distressing way. All are
relieved, and in many cases the surgeon’s knife is evaded, by the
marvellous healing power of Zam=Buk.

“I don’t see Mr. Benuet here to-day, Mr.
Wilson,” said Irish Mollie. “I want to talk
to him perticler.”
“No, I haven’t seen him. Miss d’Alroy.
Have you got a tip for him? I think lie
would be glad of that.”
“I gave him a tip last night, and my better
nature (don’t make me laugh) conquered
this morning—l want to revoke. He’ll go
utterly broke if he follows the tip.”
"Well, lie’s not here and there’s the bell,
so you won’t have time to revoke.”
A distant shout, a rhythmic kaleidoscope
stretching to a long line of many colors; a
nearer shouting and the muffled beat of hoofs
in sand. Little monkey men in fancy dress,
sitting on the heads of beautiful straining
horses, gleaming and flashing in a leaping
heap past the lawn; a wild shout that split
the sky, and 13 —4—9 on the board.
“My G—!” said Irish Mol lie.
“My dear young lady!” from old Wilson.

A menacing shout of disappointment, fading

her into the Club and gave her brandy and

“Hullo, Mollie. I don’t think much of

“Billy, I tried to ’phone you, but you were

“Hm! Rather a close shave, wasn’t it?
How do you do, sir?” to old Wilson,
“Good afternoon, Mr. Bonnot. I hope you
didn’t back Blanco? Yes? What a pity!
Oh. Mr. Cannon came in after you left yester-
day and said he would like to see you
to-morrow morning—setting out for Neuguen,

Rennet grinned respectfully.
“Thank you, sir. 1 will report to-morrow.”
HILARY LOFTING.
Leon the Devil.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHORTLY after midnight the returning
raiders loomed up grotesquely against
the stars over the top of the parapet
and toppled wearily into the trenen. in uio
dim light of a sheltered brazier the wounded
were hastily separated from the few un-
harmed and despatched back along the com-
munication-trench to the rear. The result of the
raid was indicated by the collective expres-
sion of sullen ferocity. The corporal, upon
whom had devolved all responsibility when
his immediate superior’s blood had splashed
into his face out near the German lines,
scratched; his head savagely and spat into the
lire. He, the sole surviving officer, was about
to report ,to the captain that, instead of hav-
ing returned with prisoners, as ordered, the
party of eighteen was ten men short. He had
a vivid recollection of the captain’s previous
receptions of unpleasant information. The
O.C. could express more venomous invective
in one of his casual glances than could be
spoken in an hour, and his use of silence as
a medium of speech verged upon genius.
Private Roulin, better known as “Leon the
Devil,” thrust a mass of tangled hair out of
a dark corner and spat virulent words at his
neighbors.
“No,” growled the corporal shortly. “Jean
has not returned. The Boclie was ready and
waiting. Silence!”
A shapeless mound of mud-blotched over-
coat humped itself upward from the floor of
the trench, pushed aside two cursing men,
and burst into the circle of light.
“Listen !” said a Gargantuan voice. “I ask
you where is my brother? Where is he?”
And two massive hands shot downward, grip-
ped the supports and held the brazier up to
the corporal’s face so that the sparks dripped
from it in a shower.
The corporal saw the menacing gleam in
the black eyes just in time to check himself.
“Put down the fire,” he said quickly. “If
Jean died he died like a man. We could do
nothing even if we went back. To-morrow
we shall see !”
“To Hell with to-morrow!” The released
brazier struck the trench floor in a splash
oi flame. For thirty seconds no one stirred.
Then T.eon the Devil, who had the torso of
a giant and the mentality of a fly, strode
along to the fire-step and climbed over the
parapet into the night.
The sentry, who had hurriedly stepped
aside out of the way of the infuriated Leon,
returned to his post to watch the disappear-
ing figure. Just as the form was about to
dissolve into the gloom, it halted and shouted
back to the watcher: “In an hour I shall
return. If my brother does not come back
with me, some of the Bodies will. Be care-
ful!”
As though awakened by the challenging
voice, the stammering crackle of a machine-
guh commenced froth the German trenches,
and its flaming tongue licked out across the
dark. The sentry swiftly lowered his head
below the ledge; but not quickly enough to
avoid the dirt-splash of a ricochet, which
'temporarily blinded him. For three minutes
the streaming lead flacked into the parapet
and wlieeped over the top of the trench into
the rearward gloom. Then it ceased so sud-
denly that the silence came as an aural
shock. The sentry picked the filth out of
his eyes and relieved his feelings in a blas-
phemous outburst.
“Enough !” said a weary voice. “How can
we sleep?”
Three-quarters of au hour later the sentry
caught a glimpse of a dark blotch that
seemed to be moving amongst the shadows in
front of him. Several times he had heard
suspicious sounds since Leon’s departure,
but had refrained from calling out. He had
no desire to irritate the absent man; for
Leon, on occasion, could be n sort of skin-
clad tornado. A reassuring, ferocious whis-
per floated along from the dark blotch: “Lift
your feet, dogs!” followed by a hollow
thump. In another minute seven dishevelled
figures were impelled over the parapet by
the point of a bayonet. Their captor leaned
ovei the ledge to the sentry.
"Give them to the corporal,” he growled.
"Working party. Got them in a crater.
Want three more. Can't find Jean. Swine!
Tell the corporal—ten for Jean! Will come
back with three more. Remember!” And
he went back into the night.
The sentry delivered his message and re-
sumed his watch. Shortly afterwards he was
startled by a solitary shell, which burst with
a flaring crash almost exactly between the
two lines. In the greenish glare he fancied
i hat he saw a kneeling -form suddenly fall
prostrate ; but soon dismissed the impression
because of its uncertainty. At dawn Leon
was still missing.
Forty-eight hours later, Plevain, the sen-
try, was dozing at his post when out of the
night issued a deep, seductive roar: “Oh,
swine! Oh, spawn of a sweating frog!
Come forth and meet a man.”
Plevain shivered with excitement, and
turning, awakened his weary comrades with
a shout. “Leon! Leon! It is Leon the
I )evil!”
"Silence, fool!” snarled the corporal, as
he got'up on to the fire-step. “Where is
this nightmare of yours?”
“There!” replied Plevain, pointing before
him.
The corporal leaned cautiously out over
the ledge and stared into the gloom. For
five minutes they stood rigidly attentive.
“I Ver da?” grunted a distant voice, and
a rifle flashed four times with great rapidity.
Then a succession of peculiar noises came
out of the silence. The watchers, with strain-
ing ears, strove with their interpretation.
There was a thudding of running feet and
the occasional grating clink of ironshod
boots against stone. All at once the running
ceased ; and they heard a sudden ejaculation
whose intonation was one of fear, followed
by a gabbling whine. In another minute
three panic-stricken figures with uplifted
arms seem to ooze out of the dark. They
advanced swiftly and jerkily. One of them
was mumbling “Gott! Gott! Gott!” in
monotonous repetition, and his comrades’
breathing sounded like the gasping of an
exhausted horse. Behind them marched a
fourth, and even in the gloom his massive
frame was unmistakable.
“It is Leon the Devil !” said the corporal.
“He has Iris ten at last!”
It was observed by the occupants, when
he four climbed down into the trench, that
he three prisoners hastened over to the
tire as though anxious for its warmth. Also,
they all three appeared to be on the verge of
a nervous collapse. In addition, there was
something strange about the demeanour of
the gigantic Leon. He seemed to have lost
all his fiery vigor, lie moved stiffly along
the trench with the deliberation of an autom-
aton : then halted and brought his heels
together. The light from the brazier flick-
ered up and down his mud-encrusted overcoat
from his knees to his shoulders, and glistened
back off his bloody bayonet. The terrified
expression of the three prisoners had appa-
rently affected their guardians, for not a man
stirred or spoke. Then in the gloom behind
the corporal sounded the high-pitched voice
of the lieutenant in an irritable query.
Every man stiffened as he stood, so startling
was the sound in that tense silence.
“It is Leon the Devil, lieutenant,” replied
the corporal shakily. “He has just returned
with three more prisoners. His tally is now
complete.”
“You have done well, little one,” said the
officer, peering over the brazier at the tall
figure. He turned to the silent men with a
look of astonishment, and then stared at the
corporal.
“Very quiet!” he said abruptly, and began
to sniff the air. “What in hell is the matter
with you all? Where is that”
"Leon swayed for a moment and then fell
forward striking the ground with a peculiar
flaccid crash that sent a shiver through the
watching men.
“Get a lamp!” snapped the officer.
The corporal went over to the nearest
dug-out, Obtained a lamp, and after lighting
it, handed it to the officer. They both walked
round the brazier to the fallen man. The
lieutenant leaned forward with the light in
his hand, whilst the corporal, with an effort,
turned the dead man over on to his
back. The movement loosened the fasten-
ings of the overcoat so that it opened out
sideways.
“Jesu!” gasped the lieutenant, as he un-
covered the gaping head.

O UNREALITIES !
So delicate, ye seem not flower but
dream!
Dreams just beginning—always unfulfilled—
And at your folded sweets, the eager bees
Drum an impatience, for they would arouse
You from your springtide trance to summer
ways,
Making a tom-tom beating with their wings
To summon you from your frail burial chests
Of fancies—till you break reluctantly
Into a bunch of honey and perfume!
O’er the long grasses sweep the plumes of
shade
That are the shadows of a sunny cloud,
And golden are the footfalls of the sun
Till, like a princess that the prince has kist,
You stir and turn a little in your sheath,
With some faint promise of responsiveness
That only is in Dreamland realised—
For always unto me, ye are but dreams
Too delicate to really be a flower!
Perhaps I love you all the more for this
Because you keep dawn mists and twilight
mauves
That shall be blown at noon upon the
grass—-
Lasting so brief a time... .and yet so full
Of all the lilac loveliness of sleep.
